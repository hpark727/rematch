      "Do the fuel producers have Article III standing to challenge the EPA's approval of California regulations that require automakers to manufacture more electric vehicles and fewer gasoline-powered vehicles?"

    "facts_of_the_case": "In 2012, California applied for a waiver from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to implement its Advanced Clean Car Program, which included two key components: a Low Emission Vehicle Program to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 34% for new cars in Model Years 2017-2025, and a Zero Emission Vehicle Program requiring about 15% of manufacturers\u2019 fleets to be electric cars by 2025. The EPA granted this waiver in 2013, and automobile manufacturers began investing to meet these requirements.\n\nHowever, in 2019, under a different administration, the EPA withdrew the 2013 waiver, arguing that state greenhouse gas regulations were preempted by federal fuel economy standards, that California\u2019s standards weren\u2019t necessary to meet \u201ccompelling and extraordinary conditions,\u201d and that California could not show a direct connection between greenhouse gas emissions and its air pollution problems. After this withdrawal, several automakers like Honda, Ford, and BMW voluntarily agreed to continue meeting California\u2019s standards due to their existing investments and growing consumer demand for electric vehicles. In 2022, under yet another administration, the EPA reversed course again and reinstated the 2013 waiver, prompting challenges from various states and fuel industry groups who argued that California should not receive special treatment and that climate change is not a \u201ccompelling and extraordinary condition\u201d justifying state-specific standards. California, environmental organizations, and automobile manufacturers intervened to defend the EPA\u2019s decision.\n\nThe D.C. Circuit dismissed most of the claims for lack of standing, finding that challengers had not shown that their injuries were redressable by a favorable decision.",

Obtaining this document will dramatically shift my task beliefs from general to specific, enabling a structured analysis of the petitioner's claims regarding standing.\nDesign EIG is also high (0.7) because my current design belief is that starting with the cert petition is the optimal initial strategy.

ARFFA \nSULLIVAN & CROMWELL LLP \n125 Broad Street  \nNew York, NY 10004 \n \n \n(Additional counsel on signature page) \n\n \n(I) \nQUESTIONS PRESENTED \nSection 209(a) of the Clean Air Act generally \npreempts States from adopting emission standards for \nnew motor vehicles.  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7543(a).  But under \nSection 209(b) of that Act, EPA may grant California\u2014\nand only California\u2014a waiver from federal preemption \nto set its own vehicle-emission standards.  Before \ngranting a preemption waiver, EPA must find that Cal-\nifornia \u201cneed[s]\u201d its own emission standards \u201cto meet \ncompelling and extraordinary conditions.\u201d  \nId. \n\u00a7 7543(b)(1)(B).   \nIn 2022, EPA granted California a waiver to set its \nown standards for greenhouse-gas emissions and to \nadopt a zero-emission-vehicle mandate, both expressly \nintended to address global climate change by reducing \nCalifornia vehicles\u2019 consumption of liquid fuel.  Fuel \nproducers challenged EPA\u2019s waiver as contrary to the \ntext of Section 209(b).  The D.C. Circuit rejected the \nchallenge without reaching the merits, concluding that \nfuel producers\u2019 injuries were not redressable because \nthey had not established that vacating EPA\u2019s waiver \nwould have any effect on automakers.   \nThe questions presented are: \n1.  Whether a party may establish the redressability \ncomponent of Article III standing by relying on the  \ncoercive and predictable effects of regulation on third \nparties. \n2.  Whether EPA\u2019s preemption waiver for Califor-\nnia\u2019s greenhouse-gas emission standards and zero-\nemission-vehicle mandate is unlawful. \n\n \n(II) \n \nPARTIES TO THE PROCEEDING \nPetitioners are Diamond Alternative Energy, LLC, \nAmerican Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers, Clean \nFuels Development Coalition, Diamond Alternative \nEnergy, LLC, Domestic Energy Producers Alliance, \nEnergy Marketers of America, ICM, Inc., Illinois Corn \nGrowers Association, Iowa Soybean Association, Kan-\nsas Corn Growers Association, Michigan Corn Growers \nAssociation, Minnesota Soybean Growers Association, \nMissouri Corn Growers Association, National Associa-\ntion of Convenience Stores, South Dakota Soybean As-\nsociation, and Valero Renewable Fuels Company, \nLLC. \nRespondents are the Environmental Protection \nAgency and Michael S.

It starts off modestly enough:  because both \nmotor vehicles and air pollution often cross state bor-\nders, Section 209(a) entrusts EPA to enact nationwide \nvehicle-emission standards and preempts States from \nadopting their own.  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7543(a); see id. \u00a7 7410.  \nBut then Section 209(b) does something unusual:  it  \nallows EPA to grant a waiver from preemption to a  \nsingle State\u2014California\u2014to enforce its own vehicle- \nemission standards.  To escape preemption, California \nmust demonstrate to EPA that it \u201cneed[s]\u201d its own \nemission standards \u201cto meet compelling and extraordi-\nnary conditions.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 7543(b)(1)(B).  Other States \n\n2 \n \n \nmay not establish their own standards, but they may \nelect to follow EPA\u2019s or California\u2019s. \nAs a concurrent challenge of 17 States explains, \nthere are serious constitutional concerns with a statute \nthat allows only California to act as a junior-varsity \nEPA.  Still, for its first several decades, Section 209 \nworked more or less as intended.  EPA granted \npreemption waivers for California to tackle local prob-\nlems like smog in the Los Angeles basin, where the pol-\nlution was both generated by and felt by Californians.  \nBut all sensibility stopped in 2009, when California be-\ngan claiming that Section 209 authorized it to set stand-\nards to curb greenhouse gases in an effort to tackle \nglobal climate change.  For the next decade, EPA flip-\nflopped under each new Presidential Administration \nabout whether it could grant California such a waiver.  \nIn this latest order, EPA has again taken the position \nthat Section 209 permits California to operate as a \nquasi-federal regulator on global climate change.   \nThat vaunted role cannot be squared with the text, \nstructure, or purpose of Section 209.  First, climate \nchange is not an \u201cextraordinary\u201d condition within Cal-\nifornia, and thus within the meaning of Section \n209(b)(1)(B), because it is a global issue that is not lo-\ncalized to California.  Second, California does not \n\u201cneed\u201d its own emission standards to \u201cmeet\u201d global  \nclimate-change conditions, as its standards would have \nno discernable effect on climate-change-related condi-\ntions in the State (or anywhere else).  Global climate \nchange is, in short, not the kind of California-specific \ncondition that Section 209(b) carves out from preemp-\ntion. \nThe question whether California may set green-\nhouse-gas emission standards for itself and other \n\n3 \n \n \nStates is undeniably major.  California has mandated \n100% electric vehicles by 2036, and is forcing electrifi-\ncation of the country\u2019s vehicle fleet.  And the Executive \nBranch intends exactly that.  The National Highway \nTraffic Safety Administration and EPA have set their \nown fuel-economy and emission standards that impose \nde facto electric-vehicle mandates in violation of their \ngoverning statutes.  The companion challenges to those \nrules are awaiting decision by the D.C. Circuit.  See \nTexas v. EPA, No. 22-1031 (filed Feb. 28, 2022); Natu-\nral Res. Def. Council v. NHTSA, No. 22-1080 (filed \nMay 11, 2022).  But by granting California the author-\nity to outstrip even those mandates, EPA has put in \nplace a backstop to the unlawful federal rules.  Simply \nput, the waiver and authority claimed here are key \nparts of a coordinated agency strategy to convert the \nNation from liquid-fuel-powered vehicles to electric ve-\nhicles.  If that strategy seems familiar, it should.  See \nWest Virginia v. EPA, 597 U.S. 697 (2022). \nDespite the issue\u2019s importance, the D.C. Circuit has \navoided the merits of EPA\u2019s interpretation for over 15 \nyears.  It has met each challenge to EPA\u2019s waiver de-\ntermination with a different jurisdictional barrier.  \nThis time, the D.C. Circuit dodged the issue under the \nguise of redressability.  Petitioners are entities and as-\nsociations of entities that produce or sell liquid fuels \nand the raw materials used to make them.  Facing a \nregulation designed to reduce the demand for their \nproducts, petitioners\u2019 standing is self-evident.  They \nalso introduced unrebutted standing declarations \nabout how California\u2019s standards will increase the sales \nof electric vehicles and reduce the consumption of liq-\nuid fuel\u2014which, after all, is their express purpose.  See \nApp., infra, 19a-20a.  But in a per curiam opinion, the \n\n4 \n \n \nD.C. Circuit held that petitioners had not established \nredressability because they had not submitted evi-\ndence, such as affidavits from third-party automakers, \nshowing precisely how automakers would adjust their \nproduction or prices during the four years of the \nwaiver.  Id. at 30a.  \nThe D.C. Circuit\u2019s standing decision is wrong and \nwarrants this Court\u2019s review.  Under precedents of this \nCourt and even the D.C. Circuit, \u201cremov[ing] a regula-\ntory hurdle\u201d to the sale of a challenger\u2019s product suf-\nfices to establish redressability.  Energy Future Coa-\nlition v. EPA, 793 F.3d 141, 144 (D.C. Cir. 2015) (Ka-\nvanaugh, J.); see Bennett v. Spear, 520 U.S. 154, 169 \n(1997).  At a minimum, challengers to governmental ac-\ntion can rely on the \u201cpredictable effect\u201d of regulation \non third parties to establish causation and redressabil-\nity.  Department of Commerce v. New York, 588 U.S. \n752, 768 (2019).  Where, as here, the entire point of the \nchallenged regulation is to reduce consumption of the \nplaintiffs\u2019 products, a decision vacating the regulation \nwould obviously provide redress.  Other courts of ap-\npeals applying these principles have thus found stand-\ning without relying on the sort of affidavits that the \ncourt below demanded.  Left uncorrected, the decision \nbelow will impose an often insurmountable barrier to \nchallenges in the court of appeals that is the primary \nhome for administrative litigation.   \nThis Court should also reach the merits of petition-\ners\u2019 challenge, and finally decide whether EPA has the \nauthority to grant California a preemption waiver to \naddress global climate change.  The challenged Califor-\nnia standards are in effect only through model year \n2025, so merely correcting the D.C. Circuit\u2019s standing \nmistake may mean that no court considers the merits \n\n5 \n \n \nbefore the waiver expires.  And granting review of both \nquestions presented is also the most reasonable way to \nresolve the States\u2019 concurrent challenge to the decision \nbelow.  The States challenged EPA\u2019s waiver as uncon-\nstitutional because Section 209(b) violates the principle \nof equal sovereignty, and the court below rejected that \nconstitutional argument on the merits.  App., infra, \n49a.  Granting review of the merits would allow the \nCourt to consider whether EPA\u2019s waiver is statutorily \nauthorized before needing to reach the States\u2019 consti-\ntutional questions, raised in a separate petition.  The \nCourt should grant both this petition and the States\u2019, \nand reverse. \nOPINIONS BELOW \nThe opinion of the court of appeals (App., infra, \n1a-49a) is reported at 98 F.4th 288.  The EPA order \nunder review (App., infra, 50a-285a) is available at \n87 Fed. Reg. 14,332. \nJURISDICTION \nThe court of appeals entered judgment on April 9, \n2024.  This Court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1254(1). \nSTATUTORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED \nRelevant statutory provisions are reproduced in the \nappendix to this petition.  App., infra, 286a-290a. \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nA. Legal Background \nTitle II of the Clean Air Act makes EPA the Na-\ntion\u2019s primary regulator of motor-vehicle emissions.  \n\n6 \n \n \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7410.  To effectuate a (mostly) uniform fed-\neral emissions regime, Section 209(a) of the Act prohib-\nits States from \u201cadopt[ing] or attempt[ing] to enforce \nany standard relating to the control of emissions from \nnew motor vehicles.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 7543(a).  This preemption \nprovision prevents \u201can anarchic patchwork of federal \nand state regulatory programs.\u201d  Motor & Equip. \nMfrs. Ass\u2019n v. EPA, 627 F.2d 1095, 1109 (D.C. Cir. \n1979). \nCongress allowed only one exception to Section \n209(a)\u2019s broad preemption provision:  Section 209(b), \nwhich authorizes EPA to \u201cwaive\u201d preemption for Cali-\nfornia, under limited circumstances.  42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 7543(b).

But under \nSection 209(b) of that Act, EPA may grant California\u2014\nand only California\u2014a waiver from federal preemption \nto set its own vehicle-emission standards.  Before \ngranting a preemption waiver, EPA must find that Cal-\nifornia \u201cneed[s]\u201d its own emission standards \u201cto meet \ncompelling and extraordinary conditions.\u201d  \nId. \n\u00a7 7543(b)(1)(B).   \nIn 2022, EPA granted California a waiver to set its \nown standards for greenhouse-gas emissions and to \nadopt a zero-emission-vehicle mandate, both expressly \nintended to address global climate change by reducing \nCalifornia vehicles\u2019 consumption of liquid fuel.  Fuel \nproducers challenged EPA\u2019s waiver as contrary to the \ntext of Section 209(b).  The D.C. Circuit rejected the \nchallenge without reaching the merits, concluding that \nfuel producers\u2019 injuries were not redressable because \nthey had not established that vacating EPA\u2019s waiver \nwould have any effect on automakers.   \nThe questions presented are: \n1.  Whether a party may establish the redressability \ncomponent of Article III standing by relying on the  \ncoercive and predictable effects of regulation on third \nparties. \n2.  Whether EPA\u2019s preemption waiver for Califor-\nnia\u2019s greenhouse-gas emission standards and zero-\nemission-vehicle mandate is unlawful. \n\n \n(II) \n \nPARTIES TO THE PROCEEDING \nPetitioners are Diamond Alternative Energy, LLC, \nAmerican Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers, Clean \nFuels Development Coalition, Diamond Alternative \nEnergy, LLC, Domestic Energy Producers Alliance, \nEnergy Marketers of America, ICM, Inc., Illinois Corn \nGrowers Association, Iowa Soybean Association, Kan-\nsas Corn Growers Association, Michigan Corn Growers \nAssociation, Minnesota Soybean Growers Association, \nMissouri Corn Growers Association, National Associa-\ntion of Convenience Stores, South Dakota Soybean As-\nsociation, and Valero Renewable Fuels Company, \nLLC. \nRespondents are the Environmental Protection \nAgency and Michael S.

It starts off modestly enough:  because both \nmotor vehicles and air pollution often cross state bor-\nders, Section 209(a) entrusts EPA to enact nationwide \nvehicle-emission standards and preempts States from \nadopting their own.  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7543(a); see id. \u00a7 7410.  \nBut then Section 209(b) does something unusual:  it  \nallows EPA to grant a waiver from preemption to a  \nsingle State\u2014California\u2014to enforce its own vehicle- \nemission standards.  To escape preemption, California \nmust demonstrate to EPA that it \u201cneed[s]\u201d its own \nemission standards \u201cto meet compelling and extraordi-\nnary conditions.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 7543(b)(1)(B).  Other States \n\n2 \n \n \nmay not establish their own standards, but they may \nelect to follow EPA\u2019s or California\u2019s. \nAs a concurrent challenge of 17 States explains, \nthere are serious constitutional concerns with a statute \nthat allows only California to act as a junior-varsity \nEPA.  Still, for its first several decades, Section 209 \nworked more or less as intended.  EPA granted \npreemption waivers for California to tackle local prob-\nlems like smog in the Los Angeles basin, where the pol-\nlution was both generated by and felt by Californians.  \nBut all sensibility stopped in 2009, when California be-\ngan claiming that Section 209 authorized it to set stand-\nards to curb greenhouse gases in an effort to tackle \nglobal climate change.  For the next decade, EPA flip-\nflopped under each new Presidential Administration \nabout whether it could grant California such a waiver.  \nIn this latest order, EPA has again taken the position \nthat Section 209 permits California to operate as a \nquasi-federal regulator on global climate change.   \nThat vaunted role cannot be squared with the text, \nstructure, or purpose of Section 209.  First, climate \nchange is not an \u201cextraordinary\u201d condition within Cal-\nifornia, and thus within the meaning of Section \n209(b)(1)(B), because it is a global issue that is not lo-\ncalized to California.  Second, California does not \n\u201cneed\u201d its own emission standards to \u201cmeet\u201d global  \nclimate-change conditions, as its standards would have \nno discernable effect on climate-change-related condi-\ntions in the State (or anywhere else).  Global climate \nchange is, in short, not the kind of California-specific \ncondition that Section 209(b) carves out from preemp-\ntion. \nThe question whether California may set green-\nhouse-gas emission standards for itself and other \n\n3 \n \n \nStates is undeniably major.  California has mandated \n100% electric vehicles by 2036, and is forcing electrifi-\ncation of the country\u2019s vehicle fleet.  And the Executive \nBranch intends exactly that.  The National Highway \nTraffic Safety Administration and EPA have set their \nown fuel-economy and emission standards that impose \nde facto electric-vehicle mandates in violation of their \ngoverning statutes.  The companion challenges to those \nrules are awaiting decision by the D.C. Circuit.  See \nTexas v. EPA, No. 22-1031 (filed Feb. 28, 2022); Natu-\nral Res. Def. Council v. NHTSA, No. 22-1080 (filed \nMay 11, 2022).  But by granting California the author-\nity to outstrip even those mandates, EPA has put in \nplace a backstop to the unlawful federal rules.  Simply \nput, the waiver and authority claimed here are key \nparts of a coordinated agency strategy to convert the \nNation from liquid-fuel-powered vehicles to electric ve-\nhicles.  If that strategy seems familiar, it should.  See \nWest Virginia v. EPA, 597 U.S. 697 (2022). \nDespite the issue\u2019s importance, the D.C. Circuit has \navoided the merits of EPA\u2019s interpretation for over 15 \nyears.  It has met each challenge to EPA\u2019s waiver de-\ntermination with a different jurisdictional barrier.  \nThis time, the D.C. Circuit dodged the issue under the \nguise of redressability.  Petitioners are entities and as-\nsociations of entities that produce or sell liquid fuels \nand the raw materials used to make them.  Facing a \nregulation designed to reduce the demand for their \nproducts, petitioners\u2019 standing is self-evident.  They \nalso introduced unrebutted standing declarations \nabout how California\u2019s standards will increase the sales \nof electric vehicles and reduce the consumption of liq-\nuid fuel\u2014which, after all, is their express purpose.  See \nApp., infra, 19a-20a.  But in a per curiam opinion, the \n\n4 \n \n \nD.C. Circuit held that petitioners had not established \nredressability because they had not submitted evi-\ndence, such as affidavits from third-party automakers, \nshowing precisely how automakers would adjust their \nproduction or prices during the four years of the \nwaiver.  Id. at 30a.  \nThe D.C. Circuit\u2019s standing decision is wrong and \nwarrants this Court\u2019s review.  Under precedents of this \nCourt and even the D.C. Circuit, \u201cremov[ing] a regula-\ntory hurdle\u201d to the sale of a challenger\u2019s product suf-\nfices to establish redressability.  Energy Future Coa-\nlition v. EPA, 793 F.3d 141, 144 (D.C. Cir. 2015) (Ka-\nvanaugh, J.); see Bennett v. Spear, 520 U.S. 154, 169 \n(1997).  At a minimum, challengers to governmental ac-\ntion can rely on the \u201cpredictable effect\u201d of regulation \non third parties to establish causation and redressabil-\nity.  Department of Commerce v. New York, 588 U.S. \n752, 768 (2019).  Where, as here, the entire point of the \nchallenged regulation is to reduce consumption of the \nplaintiffs\u2019 products, a decision vacating the regulation \nwould obviously provide redress.  Other courts of ap-\npeals applying these principles have thus found stand-\ning without relying on the sort of affidavits that the \ncourt below demanded.  Left uncorrected, the decision \nbelow will impose an often insurmountable barrier to \nchallenges in the court of appeals that is the primary \nhome for administrative litigation.   \nThis Court should also reach the merits of petition-\ners\u2019 challenge, and finally decide whether EPA has the \nauthority to grant California a preemption waiver to \naddress global climate change.  The challenged Califor-\nnia standards are in effect only through model year \n2025, so merely correcting the D.C. Circuit\u2019s standing \nmistake may mean that no court considers the merits \n\n5 \n \n \nbefore the waiver expires.  And granting review of both \nquestions presented is also the most reasonable way to \nresolve the States\u2019 concurrent challenge to the decision \nbelow.  The States challenged EPA\u2019s waiver as uncon-\nstitutional because Section 209(b) violates the principle \nof equal sovereignty, and the court below rejected that \nconstitutional argument on the merits.  App., infra, \n49a.  Granting review of the merits would allow the \nCourt to consider whether EPA\u2019s waiver is statutorily \nauthorized before needing to reach the States\u2019 consti-\ntutional questions, raised in a separate petition.  The \nCourt should grant both this petition and the States\u2019, \nand reverse. \nOPINIONS BELOW \nThe opinion of the court of appeals (App., infra, \n1a-49a) is reported at 98 F.4th 288.  The EPA order \nunder review (App., infra, 50a-285a) is available at \n87 Fed. Reg. 14,332. \nJURISDICTION \nThe court of appeals entered judgment on April 9, \n2024.  This Court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1254(1). \nSTATUTORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED \nRelevant statutory provisions are reproduced in the \nappendix to this petition.  App., infra, 286a-290a. \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nA. Legal Background \nTitle II of the Clean Air Act makes EPA the Na-\ntion\u2019s primary regulator of motor-vehicle emissions.  \n\n6 \n \n \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7410.  To effectuate a (mostly) uniform fed-\neral emissions regime, Section 209(a) of the Act prohib-\nits States from \u201cadopt[ing] or attempt[ing] to enforce \nany standard relating to the control of emissions from \nnew motor vehicles.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 7543(a).  This preemption \nprovision prevents \u201can anarchic patchwork of federal \nand state regulatory programs.\u201d  Motor & Equip. \nMfrs. Ass\u2019n v. EPA, 627 F.2d 1095, 1109 (D.C. Cir. \n1979). \nCongress allowed only one exception to Section \n209(a)\u2019s broad preemption provision:  Section 209(b), \nwhich authorizes EPA to \u201cwaive\u201d preemption for Cali-\nfornia, under limited circumstances.  42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 7543(b).  Congress granted California this special \nstatus because of the State\u2019s \u201cunique problems\u201d with \nsmog and other local issues caused by criteria pollu-\ntants like ozone and particulate matter.  H.R. Rep. No. \n90-728, at 22 (1967).  California\u2019s atypical \u201cgeography \nand prevailing wind patterns,\u201d together with its unusu-\nally large number of vehicles, made smog a more per-\nsistent problem there than elsewhere.  49 Fed. Reg. \n18,887, 18,890 (May 3, 1984) (citing 113 Cong. Rec. \n30,948 (Nov. 2, 1967)).   \nCongress limited California\u2019s ability to separately \nregulate emissions in several ways.  California may ap-\nply for a waiver only if it \u201cdetermines that [its own] \nState standards will be, in the aggregate, at least as \nprotective of public health and welfare as applicable \nFederal standards.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7543(b)(1).  EPA must \nthen evaluate the application and deny a waiver if, \namong other things, it finds that California\u2019s protec-\ntiveness determination is \u201carbitrary and capricious,\u201d \nid. \u00a7 7543(b)(1)(A); or if California \u201cdoes not need such \n\n7 \n \n \nState standards to meet compelling and extraordinary \nconditions,\u201d id. \u00a7 7543(b)(1)(B). \nIn 1977, Congress amended the Clean Air Act to al-\nlow any other State to \u201cadopt and enforce\u201d California \nstandards \u201cfor which a waiver has been granted,\u201d so \nlong as the State has a federally approved plan to at-\ntain the air-quality standards EPA sets for criteria pol-\nlutants.  42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7507, 7408(a), 7409.  The upshot \nof this unusual preemption system is that EPA sets na-\ntionwide emission standards; California may in limited \ncircumstances set more stringent ones in California; \nand other States may either apply EPA\u2019s standards or \nadopt California\u2019s, but may not set their own. \nB. Regulatory Background \n1. For decades, California used its waiver author-\nity as Congress intended, to set emission standards to \ncombat local air-quality problems like smog.  See, e.g., \n38 Fed. Reg. 10,235, 10,318 (Apr. 26, 1973); 59 Fed. \nReg. 48,557, 48,626 (Sept. 22, 1994).  In recent years, \nhowever, California has sought to transform this ex-\nception for tackling localized pollution into a tool for \naddressing global climate change through forced elec-\ntrification of its vehicle fleet.   \nThat effort initially failed.  In 2008, EPA denied Cal-\nifornia\u2019s first application for a waiver allowing it to set \nemission standards to address climate change.  EPA \ndetermined that Section 209(b)\u2019s preemption waiver \npermitted California to enact standards only to ad-\ndress \u201clocal and regional\u201d pollution where the \u201ccausal \nfactors are local to California\u201d\u2014which obviously did \nnot include global climate change.  73 Fed. Reg. 12,156, \n12,163 (Mar. 6, 2008).  \n\n8 \n \n \nThe day after President Obama took office, Califor-\nnia sought reconsideration of EPA\u2019s denial of its waiver \napplication for greenhouse-gas standards.  EPA \ngranted reconsideration, reversed itself, and issued the \nwaiver.  74 Fed. Reg. 32,755, 32,783 (July 8, 2009).  A \nnumber of affected parties challenged EPA\u2019s decision, \nbut the D.C. Circuit held that the case was moot be-\ncause California had \u201cdeemed\u201d compliance with federal \nstandards to satisfy the State\u2019s standards as well.  \nChamber of Commerce v. EPA, 642 F.3d 192, 206 (D.C. \nCir. 2011).   \n2.  In 2012, California applied for a new waiver to \nallow it to impose even more standards aimed at curb-\ning greenhouse-gas emissions.  This case concerns that \n2012 waiver application and the \u201cAdvanced Clean Car\u201d \nstandards that it imposes.  Those standards govern all \nnew passenger cars, light-duty trucks, and medium-\nduty vehicles sold in California for model years 2015 \nthrough 2025. \nAs relevant here, the Advanced Clean Car stand-\nards have two key features that require a preemption \nwaiver.  First, California\u2019s greenhouse-gas emission \nstandards limit carbon-dioxide emissions and thus ef-\nfectively force manufacturers to produce and sell fewer \ncars that run on liquid fuel.  78 Fed. Reg. 2,112, 2,137 \n(Jan. 9, 2013).  Second, the California standards include \na \u201czero-emission vehicle\u201d mandate, which requires \neach car manufacturer to produce and deliver for sale \nan increasing percentage of electric or fuel-cell vehi-\ncles (or purchase regulatory \u201ccredits\u201d instead).  Cal. \nRegs. tit. 13, \u00a7 1962.2(b).  By model year 2025, the re-\nquired percentage of zero-emission vehicles will rise to \naround 22%.  Ibid.  California explained that the man-\ndated zero-emission vehicles \u201ccan dramatically reduce \n\n9 \n \n \npetroleum consumption . . . compared to conventional \ntechnologies.\u201d  Advanced Clean Cars Waiver Request \n7-9 (May 2012), https://www.regulations.gov/docu-\nment/EPA-HQ-OAR-2021-0257-0006.   \n3. In 2013, EPA granted a waiver for California\u2019s \nAdvanced Clean Cars program.  EPA concluded that \nCalifornia\u2019s standards met Section 209(b)\u2019s criteria\u2014\nincluding that they were \u201cneeded to meet compelling \nand extraordinary conditions\u201d\u2014because the threat of \nglobal climate change was itself \u201ccompelling.\u201d  78 Fed. \nReg. at 2,130.  Notably, EPA credited California\u2019s find-\ning that the cost of its regulations would be \u201cmore than \noffset by consumer fuel savings over the life of the ve-\nhicles.\u201d  78 Fed. Reg. at 2,138.  At the time, however, \nCalifornia had kept in place its \u201cdeemed to comply\u201d \nprovision, and so potential challengers were stuck with \nthe unfavorable D.C. Circuit standing precedent.  Cal-\nifornia maintained that provision until 2018, when EPA \nset less stringent standards during the Trump Admin-\nistration. \n4. After that change in Administration, EPA re-\nverted to its original approach to Section 209.  In a 2019 \njoint rulemaking with NHTSA, EPA rescinded the \n2013 preemption waiver for California\u2019s greenhouse-\ngas standards and zero-emission-vehicle mandate, \nagain reasoning that climate change is not the kind of \n\u201cpeculiar,\u201d California-specific condition covered by \nSection 209(b).  84 Fed. Reg. 51,310, 51,328, 51,339 \n(Sept. 27, 2019).  In addition, EPA found that Califor-\nnia did not \u201cneed\u201d its standards to \u201cmeet\u201d climate-\nchange conditions because California\u2019s standards \nwould likely result in \u201cno change in temperatures or \nphysical impacts resulting from anthropogenic climate \nchange in California.\u201d  Id. at 51,341 (emphasis added).  \n\n10 \n \n \nC. Proceedings Below \n1. On his first day in office, President Biden signed \nExecutive Order 13,990, directing EPA to consider \n\u201csuspending, revising, or rescinding\u201d the 2019 with-\ndrawal of California\u2019s 2013 waiver.  86 Fed. Reg. 7,037 \n(Jan. 25, 2021).  EPA dutifully followed the President\u2019s \nlead and reinstated California\u2019s waiver.  App., infra, \n57a.   \nIn granting the waiver, EPA flipped back to its 2013 \nunderstanding of Section 209(b).  It concluded that the \nwaiver was justified in part because California needs \nits emission program as a whole\u2014not the particular \nAdvanced Clean Cars program that was the subject of \nthe waiver\u2014to address its criteria-pollution problems.  \nId. at 158a-166a.  EPA also found that California \nneeded its emission standards and zero-emission vehi-\ncle mandate because the effects of global climate \nchange in California are \u201cextreme,\u201d and because there \nis a \u201clogical link\u201d between local air-pollution problems \nand greenhouse-gas emissions.  Id. at 207a, 215a.   \nTo date, 17 States and the District of Columbia have \nadopted California\u2019s greenhouse-gas standards, its \nzero-emission-vehicle mandate, or both.  CARB, States \nthat Have Adopted California\u2019s Vehicle Regulations \n(June 2024), https://ww2.arb.ca.gov/our-work/programs/ \nadvanced-clean-cars-program/states-have-adopted-\ncalifornias-vehicle-regulations.  Together with Califor-\nnia, those jurisdictions account for more than 40% of \nthe Nation\u2019s new vehicle market.  87 Fed. Reg. 14,332, \n14,358 (Mar. 14, 2022). \n2. Petitioners are entities that produce or sell liquid \nfuels and the raw materials used to produce them, \nalong with associations whose members include such \nentities.  They challenged EPA\u2019s waiver reinstatement \n\n11 \n \n \nin the D.C. Circuit.  App., infra, 2a.  Petitioners filed \ndetailed standing declarations, explaining that the re-\ninstatement of California\u2019s standards would depress \ndemand for fuel, injuring them financially.  Id. at 19a-\n20a.  The State of Ohio, along with a coalition of 16 \nother States, separately challenged the reinstatement \non the ground that California\u2019s unique exemption from \nnationwide preemption violates the constitutional \nequal-sovereignty principle.   \nIn defending the waiver reinstatement, EPA did not \ncontest petitioners\u2019 Article III standing.  On the mer-\nits, it primarily relied on what it refers to as its \u201cwhole \nprogram\u201d approach.  Under this reading of the Clean \nAir Act, Section 209(b)(1)(B) is satisfied if \u201cCalifornia \nneeds its program as a whole to meet compelling and \nextraordinary conditions.\u201d  C.A. EPA Br. 84 (emphasis \nadded).  In other words, EPA argued that California \ncan tack on any emission standards it likes to its emis-\nsions \u201cprogram,\u201d \u201cso long as\u201d the State\u2019s criteria- \npollutant problems \u201cpersist.\u201d  Id. at 66.   \nUnlike EPA, California and other state and local in-\ntervenors challenged petitioners\u2019 standing.  They con-\ntended that automakers were independently increas-\ning electric-vehicle production in response to consumer \ndemand, and that petitioners had not \u201cestablished any \nprobability that manufacturers would change course if \nEPA\u2019s decision were vacated.\u201d  C.A. California \nBr. 13-15.  But their own intervention motion attached \ndeclarations asserting that \u201cadditional gasoline-fueled \nvehicles would be sold during these model years\u201d if \nEPA\u2019s waiver were overturned. C.A. States\u2019 Int. Mot., \nScheehle Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 17-18.  In reply, petitioners further \nexplained that they had standing because vacating the \nwaiver would remove a \u201cdirect regulatory impediment\u201d \n\n12 \n \n \nto their products\u2019 use.  C.A. Reply 4 (citing Energy Fu-\nture Coal., 793 F.3d at 144).  They also noted that Cal-\nifornia itself had told EPA that the waiver was \u201ccritical \nfor incentivizing production and deployment of zero-\nemission vehicles.\u201d  Id. (quoting C.A. J.A. 237). \nAt oral argument, however, counsel for the state \nand local intervenors began making similar arguments \nunder the rubric of mootness.  California contended \nthat automakers could no longer change their produc-\ntion and sales plans for vehicles covered by California\u2019s \nwaiver\u2014that is, through model year 2025.  In response, \npetitioners moved to file a supplemental brief explain-\ning why their petitions were not moot, along with sup-\nplemental declarations from individuals experienced in \nvehicle-emissions compliance, who explained that \u201cau-\ntomobile manufacturers could and likely would change \ntheir production, pricing, and/or distribution plans for \nModel Year 2025 as late as December 2025, but at a \nminimum well into 2025.\u201d  C.A. Pet. Standing Adden-\ndum, Kreucher Decl. \u00b6 5. \n3. The court of appeals held that petitioners lack \nArticle III standing to challenge EPA\u2019s waiver.  App., \ninfra, 30a.  Although the court declined to \u201cdefinitively \ndecide\u201d whether petitioners had established injury and \ncausation, it did not question either showing.  Id. at \n21a.  After all, petitioners had explained that \u201cby re-\nquiring vehicle manufacturers to sell vehicles that use \nless or no liquid fuel, California\u2019s . . . requirements de-\npress the demand for liquid fuel.\u201d  Id. at 19a.   \nInstead, the court of appeals concluded that peti-\ntioners had failed to show that their injuries would be \nredressed if EPA\u2019s decision were set aside.  App., in-\nfra, 30a.  The court reasoned that petitioners\u2019 claims \nwere not \u201cmooted by the passage of time,\u201d but rather \n\n13 \n \n \nthat petitioners had lacked standing from the start.  Id. \nat 25a.  The court faulted petitioners for \u201cfail[ing] to \npoint to any evidence affirmatively demonstrating that \nvacatur of the waiver would be substantially likely to\u201d \nprompt automakers to produce fewer electric vehicles \nor alter their prices so that fewer would be sold.  Id. at \n23a.  According to the court, petitioners had thus failed \nto establish that\u2014even if the waiver had been vacated \nat the moment it was reinstated in 2022\u2014automakers \nwould have changed any production or prices before \nthe end of model year 2025.  Id. at 23a-24a.   \nThe court of appeals also declined to consider peti-\ntioners\u2019 supplemental declarations.  App., infra, 30a.  \nThe court reasoned that there was no \u201cgood cause\u201d to \nsupplement the record because petitioners could not \n\u201chave reasonably believed\u201d that \u201ctheir standing was \n\u2018self-evident\u2019 from the record\u201d when they filed their \nopening brief.  Id. at 31a.   \nFinally, the court of appeals rejected the States\u2019 \nequal-sovereignty argument on the merits.  App., in-\nfra, 49a.  The court concluded that the \u201cfundamental \nprinciple of equal sovereignty\u201d does not operate \u201cas a \nlimit on the Commerce Clause or other Article I pow-\ners.\u201d  Id. at 36a (citation omitted).  \nREASONS FOR GRANTING THE PETITION  \nWhen petitioners filed suit, EPA\u2019s waiver controlled \nfor the next four years.  As a matter of common sense, \nif that waiver were set aside and California were una-\nble to require automakers to produce electric vehicles \ninstead of liquid-fuel vehicles, automakers would make \nor sell at least one more liquid-fuel vehicle over the \ncourse of those four years.  That is the whole point of \nthis hard-fought litigation:  that the waiver would do \n\n14 \n \n \nsomething to reduce California vehicles\u2019 consumption \nof liquid fuel, which necessarily would shift at least a \ndollar of business away from liquid-fuel sellers.  In-\ndeed, the federal government\u2014never one shy about \nraising standing objections\u2014did not even contest peti-\ntioners\u2019 Article III standing.  Yet the court of appeals \nblinded itself to the obvious, and faulted petitioners for \nfailing to prove by affidavit how third-party automak-\ners would naturally behave. \nThis Court should grant review to ensure that the \ncourt of appeals\u2019 contrived standing decision does not \nimperil future challenges to administrative action.  The \ncourt of appeals\u2019 demand for record evidence of au-\ntomaker behavior cannot be squared with this Court\u2019s \nstanding decisions, and it conflicts with decisions from \nseveral courts of appeals.  Especially concerning, it \nwould chill many legitimate agency rule challenges \nthat hinge on third-party action. \nThis Court should also resolve the merits of peti-\ntioners\u2019 challenge to EPA\u2019s statutory authority, to-\ngether with the States\u2019 constitutional equal-sover-\neignty challenge.  For over a decade, the D.C. Circuit \nhas avoided resolving whether EPA has authority to \ngrant a preemption waiver to allow California to ad-\ndress global climate change.  The court of appeals\u2019 \ndodge of the merits here is just the latest installment.  \nEPA\u2019s (current) position that Congress granted Cali-\nfornia, alone among the States, the ability to set vehi-\ncle-emission standards to combat global climate \nchange is patently wrong, and raises serious constitu-\ntional issues for the reasons discussed in the States\u2019 an-\nticipated petition.  Without this Court\u2019s immediate re-\nview, California\u2019s unlawful standards will continue to \n\n15 \n \n \ndictate the composition of the Nation\u2019s automobile \nmarket.   \nI. THE D.C. CIRCUIT\u2019S STANDING DECISION \nWARRANTS THIS COURT\u2019S REVIEW \nA. The Decision Below Is Wrong \nIn the decision below, the D.C. Circuit erected bar-\nriers to demonstrating redressability that have no ba-\nsis in this Court\u2019s Article III jurisprudence.  These bar-\nriers are especially problematic in cases like this one, \nin which the agency action concerns a question of na-\ntional importance.  Such major questions should not be \nartificially insulated from judicial review. \n1. To demonstrate Article III standing, a plaintiff \nmust show that he suffered a concrete injury, that the \ninjury is fairly traceable to the challenged action, and \nthat his \u201cinjury will be redressed by a favorable deci-\nsion.\u201d  Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 561 \n(1992) (internal quotation marks omitted).  A plaintiff \nseeking to demonstrate redressability does not need to \nestablish that a favorable judicial decision would com-\npletely cure his injury.  Rather, a judicial decision need \nonly \u201ctake steps to slow or reduce\u201d the injury.  Massa-\nchusetts v. EPA, 549 U.S. 497, 525 (2007).  Thus, when \na plaintiff asserts an economic injury, he satisfies the \nredressability requirement if a favorable decision \nwould put even one dollar back in his pocket.  Uzueg-\nbunam v. Preczewski, 592 U.S. 279, 292 (2021). \nWhen a plaintiff is the direct object of the chal-\nlenged regulation, there is usually little question that a \nfavorable decision from the court would provide re-\ndress.  See Lujan, 504 U.S. at 561-562.  The same \nshould be true when a plaintiff alleges an \u201cinjury pro-\n\n16 \n \n \nduced by determinative or coercive effect\u201d of the chal-\nlenged regulation \u201cupon the action of someone else.\u201d  \nBennett v. Spear, 520 U.S. 154, 169 (1997).  Thus, as \nthen-Judge Kavanaugh explained, if a plaintiff can \nshow that a favorable decision \u201cwould remove a regu-\nlatory hurdle\u201d to third-party conduct that would bene-\nfit the plaintiff, that is ordinarily \u201cenough to demon-\nstrate redressability.\u201d  Energy Future Coalition, \n793 F.3d at 141; see Corner Post, Inc. v. Board of Gov-\nernors of the Fed. Rsrv. Sys., 603 U.S. __ (2024) (Ka-\nvanaugh, J., concurring) (slip op., at 8) (\u201c[E]ntire clas-\nses of administrative litigation . . . have traditionally \nbeen brought by unregulated parties.\u201d).   \nEven when a plaintiff\u2019s injury arises from \u201cthe un-\nfettered choices made by independent actors,\u201d rather \nthan a rule\u2019s \u201ccoercive or determinative effect,\u201d a plain-\ntiff still may establish standing, as long as he can \u201cad-\nduce facts showing that\u201d the third party will behave in \nsuch a way as to \u201cpermit redressability of injury.\u201d  \nLujan, 504 U.S. at 562.  This Court has explained that \na plaintiff may rely on \u201cthe predictable effect of Gov-\nernment action on the decisions of third parties,\u201d and \nhas not required affidavits detailing how third parties \nwill behave.  Department of Commerce, 588 U.S. at 768 \n(emphasis added).  For example, it is predictable that \ngovernment regulation of one business \u201cmay cause \ndownstream or upstream economic injuries to others in \nthe chain.\u201d  FDA v. Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine, \n602 U.S. __ (2024) (slip op., at 12).  By contrast, stand-\ning may not rest on \u201cspeculation about the decisions of \nindependent actors\u201d when those decisions would be un-\nlawful or irrational.  Department of Commerce,  \n588 U.S. at 768 (internal quotation marks omitted).  \nThus, when a plaintiff\u2019s standing theory relies on \n\n17 \n \n \n\u201ccounterintuitive\u201d assumptions about third-party be-\nhavior, the plaintiff may need to support that theory \nwith \u201cstronger evidence.\u201d  California v. Texas, \n593 U.S. 659, 678 (2021). \nDepartment of Commerce illustrates the difference \nbetween predictable effects (which do not require ro-\nbust record evidence) and counterintuitive effects \n(which do).  There, the plaintiffs challenged the inclu-\nsion of a census question about citizenship, which they \ncontended would injure them by causing third-party \nnoncitizen households to decline to respond to the cen-\nsus.  588 U.S. at 766-767.  This Court concluded that \nthose effects were sufficiently predictable to establish \nthe causation element of standing\u2014which, like the re-\ndressability element, turns on the effect of government \naction (or its removal).  Id. at 768; see Alliance for Hip-\npocratic Medicine, 602 U.S. at __ (slip op., at 8) \n(\u201c[C]ausation and redressability . . . are often flip sides \nof the same coin.\u201d) (internal quotation marks omitted).  \nThe Court did not hold that affidavits from noncitizens \nattesting that they did not plan to participate in the \ncensus were required.  The Court found it sufficient \nthat noncitizen households had responded to the cen-\nsus at lower rates in the past, and credited the plain-\ntiffs\u2019 common-sense prediction that noncitizens would \nrespond at even lower rates if the census asked about \ntheir citizenship.  See 588 U.S. at 768. \nAn effect of agency action is \u201cpredictable,\u201d rather \nthan \u201ccounterintuitive,\u201d when the agency itself intends \nor presupposes that effect.  In Massachusetts, for ex-\nample, this Court relied on EPA\u2019s own statements and \nprograms to find that ordering EPA to set emission \nstandards would redress petitioners\u2019 injuries.  549 U.S. \n\n18 \n \n \nat 526.  The Court observed that EPA promoted volun-\ntary emissions-reductions programs, and \u201cwould pre-\nsumably not bother with such efforts,\u201d unless it \nthought that emissions reductions would have some ef-\nfect on the environment.  Ibid.  In other words, an \nagency\u2019s own assumptions about the design of its rule \nare strong evidence of the rule\u2019s predictable effects. \n2. The decision below departs from this Court\u2019s \nsensible approach to redressability.  First, petitioners\u2019 \ninjury arises from the \u201cdeterminative or coercive ef-\nfect\u201d of California\u2019s standards on third-party automak-\ners.  Bennett, 520 U.S. at 169.  By requiring automak-\ners to produce vehicles that consume less or no liquid \nfuel, California\u2019s standards and EPA\u2019s waiver pose a \nlegal barrier to the use of petitioners\u2019 products that a \nfavorable decision would redress.  Under this Court\u2019s \ncases, no more is needed.  \nBut even if petitioners had to show more, the pre-\ndictable effect of EPA\u2019s waiver on automakers is obvi-\nous:  automakers will make and sell more electric vehi-\ncles to comply with California\u2019s regulations.  Other-\nwise, California and EPA \u201cwould presumably not \nbother with such efforts.\u201d  Massachusetts, 549 U.S. at \n526.  If the regulations go away, then the government \nwill no longer be forcing automakers to sell more elec-\ntric vehicles than they would otherwise produce in re-\nsponse to market forces.  So automakers will make \nmore vehicles that run on liquid fuel, or they will adjust \ntheir prices in response to consumer demand.  That is \nEconomics 101, not a proposition that requires an affi-\ndavit for support. \nThe contrast with this Court\u2019s recent decision in \nMurthy v. Missouri, 603 U.S. __ (2024), further illus-\n\n19 \n \n \ntrates the point.  Murthy involved several circum-\nstances that may call redressability into question\u2014\nnone of which is present here.  First, Murthy did not \ninvolve direct government regulation.  Here, whatever \nindependent incentives automakers may have to in-\ncrease electric-vehicle production, compliance with \nCalifornia\u2019s standards is mandatory.  Second, in \nMurthy the government\u2019s alleged influence might not \nhave mattered at all.  Id., slip op., at 12.  Here, the \nwhole point of California\u2019s standards (and EPA\u2019s \nwaiver) is to require electrification beyond what the \nmarket was demanding.  Third, and what the Court in \nMurthy called the \u201ckey point,\u201d id. at 25 n.10, the gov-\nernment action there had concluded by the time suit \nwas brought.  There was no obvious ongoing harm for \nthe courts to correct, and so this Court could only \n\u201cspeculat[e]\u201d about redressability.  Id. at 22, 24-\n25.  Here, California\u2019s standards and mandate were re-\ninstated just months before petitioners brought suit \nand are still in place today.  Unlike Murthy, this is a \ncase where redressability should be beyond question.   \nThe court of appeals nevertheless demanded that \nthe fuel-manufacturer petitioners supply additional ev-\nidence of automakers\u2019 plans.  Although the court \nacknowledged that it was \u201cpossible\u201d that automakers \nwould change their plans and sell more liquid-fuel ve-\nhicles, it faulted petitioners for failing to supply \u201crec-\nord evidence,\u201d such as \u201cadditional affidavits.\u201d  App., in-\nfra, 24a (citation omitted).  Petitioners\u2019 standing decla-\nrations already pointed out that California itself had \nprojected that a waiver would \u201creduce emissions \nthrough reductions in fuel production.\u201d  C.A. Pet. \nStanding Addendum, Swenton Decl. at 5-6 (citation \n\n20 \n \n \nomitted).  They further explained that petitioners\u2019 in-\njuries would be ameliorated if the waiver were vacated.  \nC.A. Pet. Standing Addendum, Swenton Decl. at 7.  An-\nother declaration from the California Air Resources \nBoard projected that without the standards, \u201caddi-\ntional gasoline-fueled vehicles\u201d would likely be \u201cpro-\nduced and sold during these model years.\u201d  C.A. States\u2019 \nInt. Mot., Vanderspek Decl. \u00b6 22.  But that was not \nenough for the court of appeals.  In context, it appears \nthat the only kind of evidence the court would have \nfound sufficient is an affidavit from an automaker it-\nself, promising to change its production or pricing if the \nwaiver were vacated.   \nThat requirement is doubly wrong.  First, the court \nof appeals did not even acknowledge Bennett or De-\npartment of Commerce, or recognize that this Court \nhas allowed plaintiffs to draw logical inferences about \nrational economic behavior in assessing causation and \nredressability.  The court below did not ask whether \nthe withdrawal of a special regulatory license to Cali-\nfornia will have \u201cpredictable effects\u201d on vehicle sales.  \nDepartment of Commerce, 558 U.S. at 768.  It simply \nassumed that every effect must match up to a line in an \naffidavit. \nSecond, making matters worse, the court of appeals \nappeared to require plaintiffs to obtain affidavits from \nthe directly regulated parties\u2014here, the automakers.  \nBut directly regulated parties may have good reasons \nfor not wanting to participate in the litigation.  Maybe \nthey intend to pass on the costs, or the government has \ngarnered their complicity with some carrot that makes \nup for the regulatory stick.  Indeed, that is exactly \nwhat happened here, as several automakers entered \ninto \u201cCalifornia Framework Agreements\u201d committing \n\n21 \n \n \nthemselves to acceding to California\u2019s standards in ex-\nchange for certain benefits, like additional lead time.  \nC.A. Resp.-Int. Br. 4.  \nPetitioners\u2019 standing to challenge an agency action \nshould not depend on automakers\u2019 current preferences \nto partner with them.  The contrary rule adopted below \ncreates an unworkable hurdle to establishing standing \nin agency rule challenges\u2014one with no basis in prece-\ndent or logic.   \n3.  The court\u2019s flawed approach could doom any \nchallenge to a similar time-limited agency rule that re-\nquires some lead time to implement.  Petitioners sued \nwithin 60 days of EPA\u2019s March 2022 order.  Yet the \ncourt held that petitioners already could not obtain ef-\nfective relief because of the waiver\u2019s \u201crelatively short,\u201d \nfour-year \u201cduration.\u201d  App., infra, 22a; see Davis v. \nFEC, 554 U.S. 724, 734 (2008) (standing is assessed as \nof the date \u201cwhen the suit was filed\u201d).  Additionally, by \ngrounding its determination in standing, rather than \nmootness, the court dismissed the case without even \nholding EPA to its burden of establishing mootness or \nconsidering exceptions. \nB. The Decision Below Creates A Conflict \nAmong The Courts Of Appeals  \nBy imposing artificial hurdles on Article III\u2019s re-\ndressability requirement, the court of appeals split \nfrom several other courts of appeals.  The Second, \nFifth, Eighth, and Ninth Circuits\u2014and even the D.C. \nCircuit in other cases\u2014have all found standing based \non a law\u2019s coercive or predictable effects on third par-\nties, without requiring the sort of record evidence de-\nmanded below.  Under the D.C. Circuit\u2019s approach in \n\n22 \n \n \nthis case, those cases would have been (wrongly) dis-\nmissed on standing grounds.  \nThe Second Circuit has found standing based on a \nrule\u2019s predictable effects on third parties, without re-\nquiring third-party affidavits or similar evidence.  In \nNRDC v. NHTSA, 894 F.3d 95 (2018), the court of ap-\npeals considered an environmental group\u2019s challenge \nto NHTSA\u2019s decision to delay a rule increasing civil \npenalties for violations of fuel-economy standards.  The \npetitioners asserted an environmental injury based on \nthe assumption that third-party automakers would be \nless compliant when civil penalties were lower.  Id. at \n104.  In finding standing, the court relied on \u201ccommon \nsense and basic economics,\u201d which \u201ctell us that the in-\ncreased cost of unlawful conduct will make that conduct \nless common.\u201d  Id. at 105.  Automaker intervenors \nthere had posited that penalties \u201cha[d] the potential\u201d \nto affect their decisions, ibid., but the court did not de-\nmand affidavits proving how automakers would be-\nhave. \nThe Fifth Circuit has followed the same approach.  \nIn General Land Office v. Biden, 71 F.4th 264 (2023), \nthe court of appeals considered Texas\u2019s challenge to \nthe Department of Homeland Security\u2019s decision to di-\nvert funds appropriated for the construction of a wall \nalong the United States\u2013Mexico border.  Texas as-\nserted injuries premised on the assumption that the di-\nversion of funds would cause more unlawful immigra-\ntion.  Without requiring affidavits from undocumented \nimmigrants, the Fifth Circuit adopted the common-\nsense point that \u201c[i]n the absence of longer walls, at \nleast some illegal aliens who otherwise would have \nbeen prevented from entering Texas will seek\u201d benefits \nfrom the State.  Id. at 273.   \n\n23 \n \n \nThe Eighth Circuit, too, has relied on the predicta-\nble effects on third parties to find an injury redressa-\nble, without requiring a third-party affidavit.  Wieland \nv. Department of Health & Human Services, 793 F.3d \n949 (2015), involved a challenge to provisions of the Af-\nfordable Care Act that required certain insurers to \ncover contraceptive services.  Plaintiffs, who wanted a \ncontraception-free option, satisfied the redressability \nrequirement, because although an order enjoining \nthose laws would not require insurers to offer a  \ncontraception-free option, it was \u201clikely\u201d that insurers \nwould respond that way.  Id. at 957.   \nThe Ninth Circuit has applied similar reasoning.  It \nfound standing for plaintiffs challenging a California \ndirective that required certain insurers to offer abor-\ntion coverage.  See Skyline Wesleyan Church v. Cali-\nfornia Dep\u2019t of Managed Health Care, 968 F.3d 738, \n750 (2020).  The court of appeals did not demand affi-\ndavits from the insurers, concluding both that the di-\nrective had a \u201cdeterminative or coercive effect\u201d on the \ninsurers, and that \u201cthe predictable effect\u201d of a favora-\nble judicial decision included that \u201cat least one insurer \nwould be willing to sell\u201d a plan without abortion cover-\nage.  Ibid. \nThe decision below is not even faithful to the D.C. \nCircuit\u2019s own standing precedent.  In Energy Future \nCoalition, 793 F.3d 141, a case with strikingly parallel \nfacts to this one, the D.C. Circuit held that fuel produc-\ners had standing to challenge an EPA rule effectively \nbanning vehicle manufacturers from using certain fuel \nin emissions testing.  Id. at 144.  In an opinion by then-\nJudge Kavanaugh, the court held that the plaintiffs had \nestablished redressability, reasoning that \u201cif EPA per-\nmitted vehicle manufacturers to use\u201d the contested test \n\n24 \n \n \nfuel, \u201cthere is substantial reason to think that at least \nsome vehicle manufacturers would use it.\u201d  Ibid.  The \ncourt credited the common-sense, predictable effects \nof EPA\u2019s rule on third parties.  Yet here, after criticiz-\ning petitioners for believing their standing was \u201cself-\nevident\u201d under existing precedent, App., infra, 31a, the \ncourt below failed to even address this precedent on \nwhich petitioners\u2019 standing argument was based. \nUltimately, the court of appeals\u2019 decision in this case \ncannot be squared with any of the above decisions.  In \neach of them, the court relied on common-sense infer-\nences about how third parties behave in response to le-\ngal barriers to certain behavior.  None of them de-\nmanded the specific factual showing that the court re-\nquired here.  This Court should correct the D.C. Cir-\ncuit\u2019s outlier position before it sows significant confu-\nsion in this area. \nC. The Question Presented Is Important And \nWarrants Review In This Case \nThe question presented is exceptionally important, \nand this case presents an appropriate vehicle to con-\nsider it. \n1. The decision below threatens to chill legitimate \nchallenges to agency action.  The D.C. Circuit has tra-\nditionally served as the primary home for litigation un-\nder the Administrative Procedure Act, and it is the ex-\nclusive venue for challenges to emission standards un-\nder the Clean Air Act.  That makes its new barrier to \nagency challenges especially problematic.  As the deci-\nsions in the circuit split illustrate, there are many cir-\ncumstances in which third parties directly regulated by \nan agency rule have different incentives from an in-\n\n25 \n \n \njured petitioner.  Here, the preferences of car manu-\nfacturers and fuel manufacturers may diverge, includ-\ning because car manufacturers have been offered some \nregulatory flexibility that benefits them but not fuel \nproducers.  In other cases, a similar dynamic may arise \nbetween businesses and consumers, insurers and in-\nsured parties, and any number of other sets of potential \npetitioners.  If every regulatory petitioner in the D.C. \nCircuit must secure the cooperation of a directly regu-\nlated party to establish standing, a significant swath of \nchallenges may be doomed from the start. \nThe D.C. Circuit\u2019s unnecessary and unprecedented \nhurdle also creates bad incentives for agencies.  Under \nthe D.C. Circuit\u2019s rule, agencies could intentionally \nstructure their actions to placate directly regulated \nparties and thereby foreclose future litigation.  Those \nactions would still have sweeping effect, but the di-\nrectly regulated parties\u2014who would be the only  \npotential plaintiffs\u2014would have no incentive to sue.  \nThe result is an agency roadmap of particular concern \nbecause it insulates even major decisions like this one \nfrom judicial review. \nAt bottom, the entire purpose of California\u2019s stand-\nards and EPA\u2019s waiver determination is to reduce  \nliquid-fuel usage and mandate electrification.  That \ngoal is existential to the liquid-fuel industry, even if it \ndoes not immediately threaten car manufacturers.  \nFuel manufacturers are the obvious parties to chal-\nlenge the regulations.  The fact that fuel producers are \nnot directly regulated, when they are the direct target \nof the regulations, should not prevent them from estab-\nlishing their standing to sue. \n\n26 \n \n \n2. This case presents an appropriate vehicle for ad-\ndressing this important issue.  The redressability ques-\ntion determines petitioners\u2019 standing, as neither the \ncourt of appeals nor EPA has questioned petitioners\u2019 \nshowing of injury or causation.  See App., infra, 20a.  \nEPA has raised concerns about mootness, see id. at \n25a, but the Court can decide this case before it be-\ncomes moot.  The party asserting mootness \u201cbears the \nburden to establish\u201d that the case \u201chas become moot.\u201d  \nWest Virginia, 597 U.S. at 719.  To meet that burden, \nEPA would have to show that \u201cit is impossible\u201d for the \nCourt \u201cto grant any effectual relief.\u201d  United States v. \nWashington, 596 U.S. 832, 837 (2022) (emphasis \nadded).  It is far from impossible here:  if this Court \ngrants certiorari in October Term 2024, it will presum-\nably render a decision before model year 2025 ends.  \nAnd even if EPA could somehow establish mootness, \nthis case would fall within the capable-of-repetition ex-\nception because of the order\u2019s relatively short duration \nand the likelihood that petitioners will be \u201csubjected to \nthe same action again\u201d when EPA issues future waiv-\ners.  United States v. Sanchez-Gomez, 584 U.S. 381, 391 \n(2018).   \nII. THIS COURT SHOULD ALSO REACH THE \nMERITS AND VACATE THE WAIVER  \nThis Court should also grant the second question \npresented and decide whether EPA has the authority \nto grant California a preemption waiver to address \nglobal climate change.  Because California\u2019s waiver ex-\npires at the end of model year 2025, it is quite possible \nthe D.C. Circuit will not decide the merits on remand \nin time for this Court\u2019s subsequent review.  This EPA \nwill no doubt take the same approach to its next waiver \n\n27 \n \n \ndeterminations, and petitioners will then spend years \nsuffering ongoing injury from California\u2019s next set of \nunlawful standards and mandates.  Reaching the mer-\nits now would avoid that serious unfairness.  EPA is \nwrong on the merits, and there is no reason to wait ad-\nditional years to resolve an issue the D.C. Circuit has \npunted for over a decade. \nA. EPA\u2019s Decision Is Wrong \nThe Clean Air Act does not authorize the preemp-\ntion waiver that EPA granted here.  Section 209(a) es-\ntablishes federal control over motor-vehicle-emission \nstandards.  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7543(a).  Because of California\u2019s \nunique \u201csmog problem,\u201d Section 209(b) gives that State \nalone the right to set its own emission standards.  Mo-\ntor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the U.S., Inc. v. New York \nState Dep\u2019t of Env\u2019t Conservation, 17 F.3d 521, 526 (2d \nCir. 1994).  But Congress\u2019s baseline was nationwide \npreemption, and it tailored California\u2019s special exemp-\ntion accordingly.  As a result, EPA must find that Cal-\nifornia\u2019s standards are \u201cneed[ed]\u201d to \u201cmeet compelling \nand extraordinary conditions\u201d in California.  42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 7543(b)(1)(B). \nThe California regulations here do not meet the \nstatutory criteria.  First, California\u2019s standards do not \ntarget conditions \u201cextraordinary\u201d to California be-\ncause they were created to address global climate \nchange, which is by definition not a phenomenon par-\nticular to California.  Second, California does not \n\u201cneed\u201d its separate standards to \u201cmeet\u201d those condi-\ntions because, by EPA\u2019s own admission, the standards \nwill not materially reduce the impacts of climate \nchange in California or anywhere else.  And EPA\u2019s pri-\n\n28 \n \n \nmary defense\u2014that California needs its \u201cwhole pro-\ngram,\u201d even if not these particular standards\u2014lacks \nany basis in the text or common sense. \n1. Global \nclimate \nchange \nis \nnot \nan  \n\u201cextraordinary\u201d \nCalifornia \ncondition \nwithin the meaning of Section 209 \nThe Clean Air Act\u2019s text, structure, and history \ndemonstrate that the phrase \u201ccompelling and extraor-\ndinary conditions\u201d refers to California\u2019s distinctive lo-\ncal pollution problems; it does not encompass condi-\ntions with global cause and effect, like climate change. \na. California\u2019s separate emission standards must be \nneeded to meet \u201ccompelling and extraordinary condi-\ntions.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7543(b)(1)(B).  The plain meaning of \n\u201cextraordinary\u201d is \u201cmost unusual.\u201d  Webster\u2019s New In-\nternational Dictionary 807 (3d ed. 1961).  On its own, \nthat definition could mean \u201cmost unusual\u201d compared to \nordinary pollution problems or \u201cmost unusual\u201d com-\npared to other States\u2019 problems.  In context, it must \nmean the latter.  The Clean Air Act pairs \u201cextraordi-\nnary\u201d with \u201ccompelling,\u201d and \u201ccompelling\u201d already \ncaptures a sense of magnitude.  To avoid rendering \u201cex-\ntraordinary\u201d redundant, it must mean \u201cmost unusual\u201d \nas compared to other States.  \nRelated statutory provisions support reading the \nphrase \u201ccompelling and extraordinary\u201d to encompass \nsevere local conditions.  For example, Section 177 au-\nthorizes other States to adopt California\u2019s standards as \npart of approved plans for combatting the six criteria \npollutants that cause local pollution problems.  See \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7507.  Congress thus plainly contemplated \nthat the standards California would adopt under Sec-\n\n29 \n \n \ntion 209(b)\u2014that other States might copy under Sec-\ntion 177\u2014would help States attain local ambient air-\nquality standards within their respective borders.   \nMore generally, the structure of Section 209 makes \nclear that Section 209(b) is an exception from a uniform \nfederal regulatory regime.  See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7543(a).  It \nwould make little sense to permit California to function \nas a junior-varsity EPA and deviate from a national \nregulatory framework to address conditions that are \nbroadly shared throughout the Nation. \nSection 209(b)\u2019s history and purpose confirm that it \nauthorizes preemption waivers only for California \nstandards aimed at local air-quality issues.  In drafting \nTitle II, Congress repeatedly identified California\u2019s \n\u201cpeculiar\u201d circumstances: its \u201cunique problems\u201d re-\nsulting from local emissions and pollution concentra-\ntions interacting with the State\u2019s distinctive \u201cclimate \nand topography.\u201d  H.R. Rep. No. 90-728, at 22 (1967).  \nAs the D.C. Circuit explained decades ago, \u201cclearly the \nintent\u201d of the waiver provision was to \u201cfocus on local \nair quality problems\u201d that \u201cmay differ substantially \nfrom those in other parts of the nation.\u201d  Ford Motor \nCo. v. EPA, 606 F.2d 1293, 1303 (1979) (emphasis \nadded).   \nb. Global climate change is not a condition \u201cextraor-\ndinary\u201d to California.  By definition, global climate \nchange is neither unique to California nor uniquely felt \nby the State.  As EPA found in 2019, when it comes to \nthe effects of climate change, California is not \u201cworse-\npositioned in relation to certain other areas.\u201d  84 Fed. \nReg. at 51,348 n.278.  In fact, \u201c[m]any parts of the \nUnited States, especially western States, may have is-\nsues [caused by climate change] related to drinking wa-\nter\u201d and \u201cwildfires, and effects on agriculture.\u201d  Id. at \n\n30 \n \n \n51,348.  In other words, \u201ceffects related to climate \nchange in California\u201d are \u201cnot sufficiently different \nfrom the conditions in the nation as a whole to justify \nseparate State standards.\u201d  Id. at 51,344.  EPA did not \nrevisit that finding in 2022.  The agency thus provided \nno basis to depart from its prior conclusion, let alone \nthe heightened showing necessary for a reversal. \nTo be sure, EPA argued below that California\u2019s \nstandards do address local conditions because they \nmay have side effects on local criteria pollution.  But \nthat argument is wrong both legally and factually.  As \na legal matter, EPA cannot contrive a new goal for Cal-\nifornia\u2019s standards not presented in California\u2019s waiver \napplication.  No one disputes that the express purpose \nof California\u2019s standards was to regulate global climate \nchange.  Moreover, EPA\u2019s argument is not supported \nby the factual record.  In the waiver reinstatement, \nEPA relied on the \u201clogical link\u201d between ozone pollu-\ntion and greenhouse gases\u2014namely, that ozone levels \nare \u201cexacerbate[d]\u201d by higher temperatures caused by \nglobal warming.  App., infra, 207a-208a.  But EPA pre-\nviously found that the State\u2019s rules would produce \n\u201clikely no change\u201d to climate-change conditions\u2014in-\ncluding rising temperatures\u2014in California.  84 Fed. \nReg. at 51,341.  If California\u2019s standards will not \nchange temperatures, then they cannot affect ozone \nlevels under EPA\u2019s \u201clogical link\u201d theory either. \n2. California does not \u201cneed\u201d its own  \nemission standards to \u201cmeet\u201d climate-\nchange conditions  \nEven if California faced \u201cextraordinary\u201d conditions \nwithin the meaning of Section 209(b) from global cli-\nmate change, it does not \u201cneed\u201d its greenhouse-gas \n\n31 \n \n \nstandards and zero-emission-vehicle mandate to \n\u201cmeet\u201d those conditions.  To the contrary, as EPA ex-\nplained in 2019, California\u2019s standards \u201cwill not mean-\ningfully address global air pollution problems of the \nsort associated with [greenhouse-gas] emissions.\u201d  \n84 Fed. Reg. at 51,347, 51,349.   \na. A Section 209(b) waiver is authorized when \n\u201cneed[ed]\u201d to \u201cmeet\u201d conditions in California\u2014that is, \nonly if the proposed California emission standards \nwould appreciably affect the conditions that warrant \nthem.  That accords with the ordinary meaning of the \nstatutory terms \u201cneed\u201d and \u201cmeet.\u201d  The verb \u201cneed\u201d \nmeans to \u201cbe necessary.\u201d  Webster\u2019s New International \nDictionary, supra, at 1512.  And the term \u201cnecessary\u201d \ntypically means \u201cessential; indispensable.\u201d  American \nHeritage Dictionary 877 (1st ed. 1969).  The verb \n\u201cmeet\u201d is complementary.  In this context, it means to \n\u201csatisfy (a demand, need, obligation).\u201d  Id. at 816.   \nPutting the terms together, two things are clear.  \nFirst, California must \u201cneed\u201d\u2014i.e., require as essential \nor very important\u2014specific standards that differ from \nfederal standards.  Second, California\u2019s standards \nmust meaningfully address the conditions that give rise \nto California\u2019s need for separate standards.  At a mini-\nmum, if the State\u2019s proposed standards have no impact \non those conditions, then they cannot be said to be nec-\nessary, essential, or indispensable to \u201cmeet\u201d the condi-\ntions the State faces.  \nb. Based on EPA\u2019s own undisturbed factual find-\nings, California does not satisfy that standard for a \npreemption waiver.  In vacating California\u2019s waiver, \nEPA previously found that California\u2019s greenhouse-\ngas standards would \u201clea[d] to little to no change\u201d in  \n\u201c[greenhouse-gas] emissions at a national level,\u201d and \n\n32 \n \n \n\u201cwould result in an indistinguishable change in global \ntemperatures\u201d and \u201clikely no change in temperatures \nor physical impacts resulting from anthropogenic cli-\nmate change in California.\u201d  84 Fed. Reg. at 51,341, \n51,353 (emphases added).  Critically, in reinstating the \nwaiver, EPA did not disturb these findings about the \nfutility of California\u2019s standards.   \n3. EPA\u2019s whole-program approach is wrong \nIn defending its reinstatement decision, EPA has \nprimarily argued that Section 209(b)(1)(B)\u2014which \npermits EPA to grant a preemption waiver only if \n\u201cneed[ed]\u201d to \u201cmeet\u201d \u201ccompelling and extraordinary \nconditions\u201d\u2014is effectively irrelevant.  Under EPA\u2019s \n\u201cwhole program\u201d approach, so long as California needs \nany separate standards at all\u2014say, to combat smog\u2014\nthe State has satisfied the \u201cneed[s] . . . to meet\u201d re-\nquirement.  See 87 Fed. Reg. at 14,335.  At that point, \nCalifornia can add on any other emission standards it \nwants and tackle global problems as it sees fit. \nEPA\u2019s whole-program approach is atextual and de-\nfies common sense.  EPA relies on language elsewhere \nin Section 209(b) requiring that California \u201cdeter-\nmine[] that the State standards will be, in the aggre-\ngate, at least as protective of public health and welfare \nas applicable [federal] standards.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 7543(b)(1) (emphasis added).  But Section 209(b)\u2019s \u201cin \nthe aggregate\u201d language does not carry down to the \nrest of 209(b).  For example, Subsection (b)(1)(C) re-\nquires EPA to ensure that manufacturers have suffi-\ncient lead time to meet California\u2019s standards.  See \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7521(a)(2).  EPA does not assess whether \nmanufacturers would have adequate lead time \u201cin the \naggregate\u201d\u2014that would make no sense.  See 84 Fed. \n\n33 \n \n \nReg. at 51,332; see also C.A. Pet. Br. 46.  Similarly, \nEPA has a separate duty in Section 209(b)(1)(B) to de-\ntermine whether California \u201cneed[s] such State stand-\nards to meet compelling and extraordinary conditions.\u201d  \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7543(b)(1)(B).  That determination, like the \nneighboring lead-time determination, is not done \u201cin \nthe aggregate.\u201d \nEPA\u2019s reading would also make the Section \n209(b)(1)(B) criteria meaningless. Congress already \ndetermined that California \u201cneed[s]\u201d its own emissions \nprogram by creating the preemption exception in the \nfirst place.  On EPA\u2019s view, however, subsection \n(b)(1)(B) serves no independent purpose so long as Cal-\nifornia has any air-quality issues.  This assertion can-\nnot withstand minimal scrutiny, as the D.C. Circuit \npanel appeared to recognize at oral argument.  See C.A. \nOral Arg. Tr. 45:30 (Wilkins, J., criticizing EPA\u2019s \n\u201cwhole program\u201d approach).  \n4. Clear-statement rules favor petitioners\u2019 \nreading \nEven if EPA\u2019s interpretation were possible, several \nclear-statement rules require petitioners\u2019 reading. \nFirst, principles of constitutional avoidance require \npetitioners\u2019 reading.  The State petitioners have ar-\ngued that Section 209(b) deviates from the \u201cfundamen-\ntal principle of equality of the states under the Consti-\ntution.\u201d  Bolln v. Nebraska, 176 U.S. 83, 89 (1900).  This \nequal-sovereignty question is at least a serious one, \nand this Court should adopt a more modest interpreta-\ntion of California\u2019s waiver authority to avoid it.  Solid \nWaste Agency of N. Cook Cty. v. U.S. Army Corps of \nEng\u2019rs, 531 U.S. 159, 160 (2001).  Even if Congress \ncould grant California the unique ability to address a \n\n34 \n \n \nlocal problem, it would be a far graver intrusion on \nequal-sovereignty principles to grant California alone \nthe ability to address global climate change.  Cf. South \nCarolina v. Katzenbach, 383 U.S. 301, 328-329 (1964) \n(\u201cThe doctrine of the equality of States\u201d does not bar \n\u201cremedies for local evils which have subsequently ap-\npeared.\u201d).   \nSecond, the major-questions doctrine applies to Cal-\nifornia\u2019s efforts to tackle global climate change and \nforce a transition to electric vehicles.  This Court \u201cex-\npect[s] Congress to speak clearly if it wishes to assign \nto an agency decisions of \u2018vast economic and political \nsignificance.\u2019\u201d  Utility Air Regul. Grp. v. EPA, \n573 U.S. 302, 324 (2014) (citation omitted).  On EPA\u2019s \nview, Section 209 authorizes the agency to permit Cal-\nifornia to adopt vehicle-emission standards to tackle \nclimate change, and to force a transition to electric ve-\nhicles that would have enormous repercussions for the \nnational economy, the States\u2019 electric grids, and na-\ntional security.  This Court should \u201cgreet\u201d EPA\u2019s \u201cas-\nsertions of \u2018extravagant statutory power over the na-\ntional economy\u2019 with \u2018skepticism.\u2019\u201d  West Virginia,  \n597 U.S. at 724 (citation omitted). \nThird, the federalism canon points in the same di-\nrection.  Congress must be \u201cunmistakably clear in the \nlanguage of the statute\u201d if it \u201cintends to alter the \u2018usual \nconstitutional balance between the States and the Fed-\neral government.\u2019\u201d Gregory v. Ashcroft, 501 U.S. 452, \n460-461 (1991) (citation omitted).  Yet under EPA\u2019s \nview, California alone among the States can regulate \nthe nation\u2019s automobile market in the service of ad-\ndressing climate change and forcing a transition to \nelectric vehicles. \n\n35 \n \n \nB. The Question Presented Is Important, Is  \nImplicated In The States\u2019 Petition, And  \nRepeatedly Evades Review \nThe extent of EPA\u2019s authority to grant California a \npreemption waiver warrants this Court\u2019s immediate \nreview.  It is a question that shapes the direction of the \nentire country\u2019s automobile industry but that has re-\npeatedly evaded judicial scrutiny.  And it is a question \nantecedent to the constitutional issue that the court of \nappeals reached and that is the subject of the State pe-\ntitioners\u2019 concurrent challenge. \n1.  Section 209(b), if construed to allow California \nto tackle nationwide issues like global climate change, \nbecomes a huge source of power to regulate the coun-\ntry\u2019s economy.  California is a significant market in its \nown right, and 17 States and the District of Columbia \nhave opted into at least some of California\u2019s standards.  \nSee supra, p. 10.  Additionally, both EPA and NHTSA \nhave relied on California\u2019s standards in setting their \nrespective (and unlawful) vehicle-emission standards \naimed at forcing electrification.  See 86 Fed. Reg. \n74,434, 74,457-74,458 (Dec. 30, 2021); 87 Fed. Reg. \n25,710, 25,762-25,765 (May 2, 2022).  No wonder Cali-\nfornia\u2019s governor described its vehicle-emission rules \nas \u201cone of the most significant steps to the elimination \nof the tailpipe as we know it.\u201d  Coral Davenport et al., \nCalifornia to Ban the Sale of New Gasoline Cars, N.Y. \nTimes (Aug. 24, 2022), https://www.nytimes.com/2022/ \n08/24/climate/california-gas-cars-emissions.html. \nA wait-and-see approach would embolden California \nto stretch Section 209(b) even further.  Since petition-\ners brought this case, California has adopted its \nso-called Advanced Clean Cars II standards, along \nwith Advanced Clean Fleets and Advanced Clean \n\n36 \n \n \nTrucks rules, which collectively mandate 100% electri-\nfication of every class of new vehicles by 2036.  See \nCARB, Public Hearing to Consider the Proposed Ad-\nvanced Clean Cars II Regulations 12 (Apr. 12, 2022), \nhttp://ww2.arb.ca.gov/sites/default/files/barcu/regact/2022 \n/accii/isor.pdf.  EPA\u2019s waiver thus enables California to \nforce automakers to electrify their entire fleets in Cal-\nifornia and any State that adopts its standards. \n2. This Court should also grant review of the sec-\nond question because the States\u2019 anticipated petition \npresents a serious constitutional question that should \nbe considered together with petitioners\u2019 statutory chal-\nlenge.  The State petitioners are challenging the D.C. \nCircuit\u2019s decision holding that Section 209 does not vi-\nolate the principle of equal sovereignty.  Unless this \nCourt grants review of both questions presented here, \nthe Court will not have complete briefing on a narrower \nstatutory alternative to resolving the States\u2019 constitu-\ntional challenge.   \n3. Finally, this Court should hear the second ques-\ntion presented because it has for too long evaded this \nCourt\u2019s review and may otherwise continue to do so.  \nThe challenged waiver is in effect only through model \nyear 2025.  That means that there will likely be time for \na merits decision in this Court, or a remand and poten-\ntial merits decision in the court of appeals, but not both \nwithout having to litigate mootness issues that may \ncomplicate this Court\u2019s review.  \nPetitioners have endured decades of regulatory \nwhiplash only for the D.C. Circuit to repeatedly reject \nany legal challenges on threshold grounds.  Absent this \nCourt\u2019s review, petitioners will be back at square one, \nhaving to litigate additional challenges to EPA\u2019s next \nwaiver, all while suffering ongoing injury.  Critical \n\n37 \n \n \nAmerican industries deserve the certainty that can \nonly be provided by this Court\u2019s finally defining the ex-\ntent of EPA\u2019s authority under Section 209(b).   \nCONCLUSION \nThe petition for a writ of certiorari should be \ngranted. \n \nRespectfully submitted. \n \nERIC D.

REGAN, IN HIS OFFICIAL \nCAPACITY AS ADMINISTRATOR OF THE U.S. \nENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY, \nRespondents, \nADVANCED ENERGY UNITED, et al., \nIntervenors\nSeptember 15, 2023, Argued; April 9, 2024, Decided\nOn Petitions for Review of a Final Action \nof the Environmental Protection Agency \n(1a)\n\n2a\nOPINION OF THE COURT\nBefore: Wilkins, Childs, and Garcia, Circuit Judges.\nOpinion for the Court filed Per Curiam.\nPer Curiam: These consolidated petitions for review \nconcern a 2022 decision by the Environmental Protection \nAgency (\u201cEPA\u201d) to reinstate the EPA\u2019s prior decision, \nin 2013, to waive federal preemption of two California \nregulations regarding automobile emissions under the \nClean Air Act. The regulations in question are a standard \nlimiting greenhouse gas emissions and a requirement that \na certain percentage of new vehicles manufactured in the \nstate each year be zero-emissions vehicles (\u201cZEV\u201d), see \n13 Cal. Code Regs. \u00a7\u00a7\u00a01961.3, 1962.2, respectively. Two \nsets of Petitioners challenge the EPA\u2019s decision. The \nfirst group of Petitioners comprises seventeen states \n(\u201cState Petitioners\u201d).1 The second group of Petitioners \nincludes entities that produce or sell liquid fuels and the \nraw materials used to produce those fuels, along with \nassociations whose members include such entities (\u201cFuel \nPetitioners\u201d).2 Both State and Fuel Petitioners claim that \n1.\u2002 State Petitioners are the State of Ohio, State of Alabama, \nState of Arkansas, State of Georgia, State of Indiana, State of \nKansas, Commonwealth of Kentucky, State of Louisiana, State of \nMississippi, State of Missouri, State of Montana, State of Nebraska, \nState of Oklahoma, State of South Carolina, State of Texas, State of \nUtah, and State of West Virginia.\n2.\u2002 Fuel Petitioners are American Fuel & Petrochemical \nManufacturers, Clean Fuels Development Coalition, Diamond \nAlternative Energy, LLC, Domestic Energy Producers Alliance, \n\n3a\nthe EPA was not authorized to grant California the waiver \nunder the Clean Air Act. Fuel Petitioners argue that the \nEPA exceeded its statutory authority under the Clean \nAir Act. State Petitioners, meanwhile, contend that the \nEPA\u2019s waiver reinstatement decision was contrary to law \nbecause the relevant California regulations are preempted \nby a separate federal statute, the Energy Policy and \nConservation Act of 1975 (\u201cEPCA\u201d), 49 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a032919(a). \nState Petitioners also claim that by granting a waiver \nto California alone, the EPA violated a constitutional \nrequirement that the federal government treat states \nequally in terms of their sovereign authority. We hold that \nFuel Petitioners lack standing to raise their statutory \nclaim, and that State Petitioners lack standing to raise \ntheir preemption claim, because neither set of Petitioners \nhas demonstrated that their claimed injuries would be \nredressed by a favorable decision by this Court. While \nwe hold that State Petitioners have standing to raise their \nconstitutional claim, we reject it on the merits.\nI.\nA.\nWhile the Clean Air Act typically grants states broad \ndiscretion to meet federal air quality goals, emissions \nstandards for new automobiles are promulgated at the \nEnergy Marketers of America, ICM, Inc., Illinois Corn Growers \nAssociation, Iowa Soybean Association, Kansas Corn Growers \nAssociation, Michigan Corn Growers Association, Minnesota \nSoybean Growers Association, Missouri Corn Growers Association, \nNational Association of Convenience Stores, South Dakota Soybean \nAssociation, and Valero Renewable Fuels Company, LLC.\n\n4a\nfederal level. The Clean Air Act empowers the EPA to \npromulgate federal emissions standards for those vehicles, \nsee 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a07521, and it preempts any corresponding \nstate regulation, expressly preventing the adoption of \nemissions standards for new vehicles and/or engines as \nfollows:\n(a) Prohibition\nNo State or any political subdivision thereof \nshall adopt or attempt to enforce any standard \nrelating to the control of emissions from new \nmotor vehicles or new motor vehicle engines \nsubject to this part. No State shall require \ncertification, inspection, or any other approval \nrelating to the control of emissions from any \nnew motor vehicle or new motor vehicle engine \nas condition precedent to the initial retail sale, \ntitling (if any), or registration of such motor \nvehicle, motor vehicle engine, or equipment.\nId. \u00a7\u00a07543(a) (\u201cSection 209(a)\u201d). However, the Clean Air \nAct permits the EPA to waive application of Section 209(a) \nto any state under certain circumstances:\n(b) Waiver\n(1) The Administrator shall, after notice \nand opportunity for public hearing, waive \napplication of this section to any State which \nhas adopted standards (other than crankcase \nemission standards) for the control of emissions \n\n5a\nfrom new motor vehicles or new motor vehicle \nengines prior to March 30, 1966, if the State \ndetermines that the State standards will be, \nin the aggregate, at least as protective of \npublic health and welfare as applicable Federal \nstandards. No such waiver shall be granted if \nthe Administrator finds that\u2014\n(A) the determination of the State is \narbitrary and capricious,\n(B) such State does not need such State \nstandards to meet compelling and \nextraordinary conditions, or\n(C) such State standards and accompanying \nenforcement procedures are not consistent \nwith section 7521(a) of this title.\n(2) If each State standard is at least as stringent \nas the comparable applicable Federal standard, \nsuch State standard shall be deemed to be at \nleast as protective of health and welfare as such \nFederal standards for purposes of paragraph \n(1).\n(3) In the case of any new motor vehicle or new \nmotor vehicle engine to which State standards \napply pursuant to a waiver granted under \nparagraph (1), compliance with such State \nstandards shall be treated as compliance with \napplicable Federal standards for purposes of \nthis subchapter.\n\n6a\nId. \u00a7\u00a07543(b) (\u201cSection 209(b)\u201d). California is the only \nstate that had adopted standards (other than crankcase \nemission standards) for the control of emissions from new \nmotor vehicles or new motor vehicle engines as of March \n30, 1966. See Motor & Equip. Mfrs. Ass\u2019n v. EPA, 627 F.2d \n1095, 1100 n.1, 201 U.S. App. D.C. 109 (D.C. Cir. 1979).\nIf California applies to promulgate automobile \nemissions standards that it has determined are at least \nas protective of public health and welfare as the existing \nfederal regulations, the Clean Air Act requires the EPA to \nwaive preemption as to those regulations, unless certain \ncriteria (the \u201cwaiver denial criteria\u201d) are met. 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7\u00a07543(b). The EPA may refuse to grant a waiver only if: (1) \nCalifornia\u2019s \u201cdetermination .\u00a0.\u00a0. is arbitrary and capricious,\u201d \n(2) California \u201cdoes not need such State standards to meet \ncompelling and extraordinary conditions,\u201d or (3) the \n\u201cstandards and accompanying enforcement procedures \nare not consistent with [42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a07521(a)].\u201d Id. \u00a7\u00a07543(b)\n(1)(A)\u2013(C). In other words, the federal regulations continue \nto act as the floor for emissions regulations, but California \ncan seek to enact its own more stringent regulatory \nprogram above those federal requirements.\nSections 209(a) and (b) of the Clean Air Act together \nmake up a statutory compromise between several \ncompeting interests. When Congress enacted the Clean \nAir Act in 1967, California suffered from significant air \nquality and pollution problems caused by motor vehicle \nemissions, which federal emissions regulations were \nunlikely to adequately address. See S. Rep. No. 90-403, \nat 33\u201334 (1967); H.R. Rep. No. 90-728, at 21\u201323, 96\u201397 \n\n7a\n(1967). California was also the only state with its own \nmotor vehicle emissions standards, and its leadership in \nautomobile emissions regulation had been valuable to the \nfederal government in crafting the Clean Air Act. See \nS. Rep. No. 90-403, at 33\u201334; H.R. Rep. No. 90-728, at \n21\u201323, 96\u201397. At the same time, automobile manufacturers \nwere growing concerned that other states might begin \nregulating automobile emissions, subjecting them to a \npatchwork of regulatory obligations and significantly \nincreasing manufacturing costs. See H.R. Rep. No. \n90-728, at 21; see also Engine Mfrs. Ass\u2019n v. EPA, 88 \nF.3d 1075, 1079, 319 U.S. App. D.C. 12 (D.C. Cir. 1996). \nCongress enacted Sections 209(a) and (b) to balance the \nfears of automobile manufacturers, California\u2019s need for \nbespoke regulation, and the federal interest in allowing \nCalifornia to test new emissions regulations. Section \n209(a) addresses the fears of automakers and ensures \nnational uniformity in automobile emissions standards \nby preempting state regulation. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a07543(a). \nMeanwhile, Section 209(b) grandfathers in California\u2019s \nregulatory program and allows it to continue innovating \nnew solutions to automobile pollution. See id. \u00a7\u00a07543(b); \nsee also Engine Mfrs. Ass\u2019n, 88 F.3d at 1080.\nB.\nThe D.C. Circuit is familiar with interpreting the \nClean Air Act. Shortly following the enactment of Section \n209(b), the D.C. Circuit addressed the question of how \nCalifornia should determine that its regulations are more \nprotective than the federal regulations. See Motor & Equip. \nMfrs. Ass\u2019n, 627 F.2d at 1095. California sought to impose \n\n8a\nregulations on oxides of nitrogen that were significantly \nmore stringent than their federal counterparts. Id. at \n1110 n.32. However, due to technological constraints, \nemissions control devices could not be constructed to \nmeet both California\u2019s oxides of nitrogen standard and \na carbon monoxide standard as stringent as the federal \nstandard. Id. In an effort to impose its high oxides of \nnitrogen standard, California proposed a carbon monoxide \nstandard that was less stringent than the federal carbon \nmonoxide standard. Id. The EPA allowed California\u2019s \nstringent oxides of nitrogen standard to make up for \nits less stringent carbon monoxide standard, as long as \nits regulatory program as a whole was more protective \nthan the federal regulations. Id. Dissatisfied with this \ndecision, opponents of California\u2019s regulations argued \nthat Section 209(b) required California to show that \nits carbon monoxide standard was individually more \nprotective than the federal carbon monoxide standard. In \n1977, Congress resolved this dispute by amending Section \n209(b). The new language of Section 209(b) made explicit \nthat California need only determine that its standards are, \n\u201cin the aggregate, at least as protective of public health \nand welfare\u201d as the federal standards. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a07543(b)\n(1). So long as California has made that determination, \nthe EPA must grant California a waiver unless the EPA \nfinds that any of the waiver denial criteria are met. See \nid. \u00a7\u00a07543(b)(1)(A)\u2013(C). The amendment ensures that \nCalifornia is not required to determine that each new \nproposed regulation is more protective than its federal \ncounterpart. Id. It was intended to give California the \n\u201cbroadest discretion in selecting the best means to protect \n\n9a\nthe health of its citizens and the public welfare.\u201d H.R. Rep. \nNo. 95-294, at 301\u201302 (1977).3\nAfter Congress amended Section 209(b) to provide \nthat California need only determine that its standards \nwere, \u201cin the aggregate,\u201d at least as protective as the \nfederal standards, the EPA decided to apply a similar \napproach to its analysis of whether California\u2019s proposed \nstandards met any of the waiver denial criteria. See 42 \nU.S.C. \u00a7\u00a07543(b)(1)(A)\u2013(C). Thus, in examining whether \nany of the waiver denial criteria applied, the EPA \nconsidered only whether California\u2019s proposed standards, \nin the aggregate, met any of the criteria\u2014not whether \neach individual standard could be denied under any of \nthe criteria. The EPA continued to evaluate California\u2019s \nwaiver applications under Section 209(b) using this \naggregate method of evaluation for decades. In the fifty-\nfive years since Section 209(b) was originally enacted, \nthe EPA has granted California seventy-five waivers \nusing the aggregate method of evaluation. See California \nState Motor Vehicle Pollution Control Standards; \nAdvanced Clean Car Program; Reconsideration of a \nPrevious Withdrawal of a Waiver of Preemption; Notice \nof Decision, 87 Fed. Reg. 14337 (Mar. 14, 2022) (\u201c2022 \nWaiver Reinstatement Decision\u201d); see also EPA, Vehicle \n3.\u2002 The 1977 Clean Air Act amendments also empowered \nother states to choose between adopting the federal standards or \nthe California standards. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a07507. As of the date of this \nopinion, seventeen states have chosen to adopt some portion of \nthe California regulations. See Cal. Air Res. Bd., States that Have \nAdopted California\u2019s Vehicle Regulations, https://perma.cc/HCS4-\nX7NP (last visited Mar. 27, 2024).\n\n10a\nEmissions California Waivers and Authorizations, \nhttps://perma.cc/5T7U-L8GE (last visited Mar. 27, 2024).\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, California\u2019s emissions \nstandards focused on ozone-generating pollutants, like \nnitrogen oxides, but over time, California expanded \nits regulatory program to restrict a variety of other \nemissions, such as methane and other greenhouse gases. \nSee, e.g., California State Motor Vehicle Pollution \nControl Standards; Waiver of Federal Preemption, 43 \nFed. Reg. 25729, 25735 (June 14, 1978); California State \nMotor Vehicle Pollution Control Standards; Waiver of \nFederal Preemption Notice of Decision, 49 Fed. Reg. \n18887, 18890 (May 3, 1984). In 1993, the EPA approved \na waiver of California\u2019s first ZEV standard, which \nrequired an annually increasing percentage of vehicles \nsold in California to produce zero tailpipe emissions. \nSee California State Motor Vehicle Pollution Control \nStandards; Waiver of Federal Preemption; Decision, 58 \nFed. Reg. 4166 (Jan. 13, 1993).\nC.\nIn recent decades, California has continued to face \nsignificant pollution and climate challenges. It contains \nseven of the ten worst areas for ozone pollution in the \ncountry and six of the ten worst areas for small particulate \nmatter. See 2022 Waiver Reinstatement Decision, 87 Fed. \nReg. at 14377 n.469. It also faces \u201cincreasing risks from \nrecord-setting fires, heat waves, storm surges, sea-level \nrise, water supply shortages and extreme heat.\u201d Id. at \n14363; see also id. at 14338\u201339 & nn.37, 43. And these \nconditions are exacerbated by climate change. Id. at \n\n11a\n14350 & n.165. Moreover, pollution and climate change \nhave particularly harmful impacts on California due to its \nlarge agriculture and ocean-based economies, dependence \non an over-stressed water supply, long coastlines, and \nsusceptibility to wildfires. See California State Motor \nVehicle Pollution Control Standards; Notice of Decision \nGranting a Waiver of Clean Air Act Preemption for \nCalifornia\u2019s 2009 and Subsequent Model Year Greenhouse \nGas Emission Standards for New Motor Vehicles, 74 Fed. \nReg. 32744, 32746 (July 8, 2009).\nTo combat these challenges, in 2005, California \napplied for a waiver for a new set of regulations limiting \ngreenhouse gas emissions. See Cal. Air Res. Bd., Low-\nEmission Vehicle Greenhouse Gas Program, https://\nperma.cc/VC85-GQ2S (last visited Mar. 27, 2024). The \nrequest sparked disagreement among several subsequent \npresidential administrations. Under President George \nW. Bush\u2019s Administration, the EPA initially denied the \nwaiver on the basis that the standards were not addressing \n\u201ccompelling and extraordinary conditions.\u201d California \nState Motor Vehicle Pollution Control Standards; \nNotice of Decision Denying a Waiver of Clean Air Act \nPreemption for California\u2019s 2009 and Subsequent Model \nYear Greenhouse Gas Emission Standards for New Motor \nVehicles, 73 Fed. Reg. 12156, 12159\u201363 (Mar. 6, 2008). One \nyear later, under the Obama Administration, the EPA \ndetermined that its initial decision to deny the waiver \nhad been based on an incorrect interpretation of Section \n209(b), and ultimately granted the waiver. California \nState Motor Vehicle Pollution Control Standards; \nNotice of Decision Granting a Waiver of Clean Air Act \nPreemption for California\u2019s 2009 and Subsequent Model \n\n12a\nYear Greenhouse Gas Emission Standards for New Motor \nVehicles, 74 Fed. Reg. 32744, 32745\u201346 (July 8, 2009).\nIn 2012, California applied for the waiver at issue in \nthis case, seeking to promulgate a new set of regulations \ncalled the Advanced Clean Car Program. See California \nState Motor Vehicle Pollution Control Standards; Notice of \nDecision Granting a Waiver of Clean Air Act Preemption \nfor California\u2019s Advanced Clean Car Program and a \nWithin the Scope Confirmation for California\u2019s Zero \nEmission Vehicle Amendments for 2017 and Earlier \nModel Years, 78 Fed. Reg. 2112 (Jan. 9, 2013). The new \nregulations included a Low Emission Vehicle (\u201cLEV\u201d) \nProgram, which set emissions requirements for new cars \nin Model Years 2017 to 2025 with the goal of reducing \ncarbon dioxide emissions by thirty-four percent, and a \nZEV Program, which required around fifteen percent of \nmanufacturers\u2019 fleets to be electric cars by Model Year \n2025. Id. The EPA initially granted the waiver in 2013. \nId. In response, automobile manufacturers in California \nbegan making investments to meet both programs\u2019 \nrequirements. See, e.g., Industry Resp.-Intervenor Br. \n2\u20134.\nIn 2018, after car manufacturers had adjusted their \nfleets to comply with California\u2019s Advanced Clean Car \nProgram, the EPA changed its course. It issued a notice of \nproposed rulemaking to withdraw the portions of the 2013 \nwaiver covering California\u2019s LEV and ZEV standards. \nSee The Safer Affordable Fuel-Efficient (SAFE) Vehicles \nRule for Model Years 2021-2026 Passenger Cars and Light \nTrucks, 83 Fed. Reg. 42986 (Aug. 24, 2018).\n\n13a\nThe EPA withdrew the 2013 waiver on September \n27, 2019. The Safer Affordable Fuel-Efficient (SAFE) \nVehicles Rule Part One: One National Program, 84 Fed. \nReg. 51310 (Sept. 27, 2019) (\u201c2019 Withdrawal Decision\u201d). \nThe EPA offered three bases for the withdrawal. Id. at \n51328\u201341. First, the 2013 waiver conflicted with a recent \ndetermination by the National Highway Traffic Safety \nAdministration (\u201cNHTSA\u201d) that state greenhouse gas \nregulations were preempted by a provision of the EPCA \nthat prohibits states from enacting their own fuel economy \nstandards. Id. at 51337\u201338; see also 49 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a032902(a), \n(f) (empowering the NHTSA to set federal fuel economy \nstandards); id. \u00a7\u00a032919(a) (preempting state fuel economy \nstandards). Second, the EPA had decided that it would \nno longer follow a \u201cwhole program\u201d interpretation of \nSection 209(b), and instead would evaluate whether each \nindividual California standard met the requirement that \nit be necessary to \u201cmeet compelling and extraordinary \nconditions.\u201d 2019 Withdrawal Decision, 84 Fed. Reg. at \n51341 (quoting 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a07543(b)(1)). Third, California \ncould not show that its LEV and ZEV regulations were \nnecessary to meet compelling and extraordinary conditions \nbecause California could not show a \u201cparticularized \nnexus\u201d between greenhouse gas emissions and California\u2019s \nair pollution problems. Id. According to the EPA, because \ngreenhouse gas pollution from global sources is blended \nin the atmosphere, the consequences of climate change \nfrom which California suffered were not \u201ccompelling and \nextraordinary.\u201d Id. at 51333\u201334.\nFollowing recission of the 2013 waiver, automobile \nmanufacturers such as Honda, Ford, Volvo, BMW, \n\n14a\nand Volkswagen entered into independent agreements \nwith California to continue reducing emissions. See \nRevised 2023 and Later Model Year Light-Duty Vehicle \nGreenhouse Gas Emissions Standards, 86 Fed. Reg. \n74434, 74458 (Dec. 30, 2021). Under these agreements, \nthe automakers would continue to meet the LEV \nand ZEV standards in the California regulations. Id. \nAutomakers were motivated to sign these agreements by \nthe investments they had already made in updating their \nfleets and growing consumer demand for electric vehicles. \nSee J.A. 155\u201357.\nIn 2021, under the Biden Administration, the EPA \nrevisited its 2019 withdrawal of the 2013 waiver. California \nState Motor Vehicle Pollution Control Standards; \nAdvanced Clean Car Program; Reconsideration of \na Previous Withdrawal of a Waiver of Preemption; \nOpportunity for Public Hearing and Public Comment, \n86 Fed. Reg. 22421 (Apr. 28, 2021). On March 14, 2022, the \nEPA reinstated its 2013 waiver for California\u2019s Advanced \nClean Car Program. 2022 Waiver Reinstatement Decision, \n87 Fed. Reg. at 14332. As a result of that reinstatement, \nCalifornia\u2019s LEV and ZEV standards for Model Years \n2017 through 2025 came back into force. Id. at 14333. \nThe EPA provided three explanations for its 2022 Waiver \nReinstatement Decision: the EPA exceeded its inherent \nauthority to revisit its 2013 decision; it improperly \nrejected the \u201cwhole program\u201d approach; and it improperly \nconsidered the NHTSA\u2019s view of the EPCA, which was \nbeyond the scope of Section 209(b). Id. at 14333\u201335.\n\n15a\nD.\nOn May 12, 2022, State Petitioners filed a petition \nfor review in this Court challenging the EPA\u2019s decision \nto reinstate the 2013 waiver (22-1081). That same day, \nthree groups of Fuel Petitioners filed petitions for \nreview of the same EPA action (22-1083, 22-1084, and \n22-1085). The Court consolidated these cases (22-1081). \nCalifornia and several other states and cities (collectively, \n\u201cCalifornia\u201d),4 environmental organizations, 5 and \nautomobile manufacturers6 have intervened in support \nof respondents in the consolidated case.\n4.\u2002 The state and city intervenors are the City of Los Angeles, \nthe City of New York, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, the District \nof Columbia, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, \nIllinois, Maine, Maryland, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New \nMexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, \nand Washington.\n5.\u2002 The environmental organization intervenors are the Center \nfor Biological Diversity, the Clean Air Council, the Conservation Law \nFoundation, the Environmental Defense Fund, the Environmental \nLaw and Policy Center, the National Parks Conservation Association, \nthe Natural Resources Defense Council, the Public Citizen, the \nSierra Club, and the Union of Concerned Scientists.\n6.\u2002 The automobile manufacturer intervenors are Ford Motor \nCompany, Volkswagen Group of America, Inc., BMW of North \nAmerica, LLC, American Honda Motor Co., Inc., Volvo Car USA \nLLC, the National Coalition for Advanced Transportation, Advanced \nEnergy Economy, Calpine Corporation, National Grid USA, the New \nYork Power Authority, and the Power Companies Climate Coalition.\n\n16a\nIn their petition, Fuel Petitioners argue that the 2022 \ndecision was arbitrary and capricious and exceeded the \nEPA\u2019s authority under Section 209(b) because climate \nchange is not a \u201ccompelling and extraordinary condition,\u201d \nand California does not \u201cneed\u201d its standards to \u201cmeet\u201d \nits climate conditions. See, e.g., Fuel Pet. Br. 10\u201311. In \nchallenging the EPA\u2019s determination of California\u2019s \n\u201cneed,\u201d Fuel Petitioners argue that the EPA\u2019s aggregate \napproach is wrong. Id. Meanwhile, State Petitioners \nclaim that by granting a waiver to California, but not to \nany other state, the EPA has violated State Petitioners\u2019 \nconstitutional right to equal sovereignty. See State Pet. \nBr. 28\u201333. State Petitioners also claim that the waiver \nis contrary to the preemption of state fuel economy \nstandards set out in the EPCA. See State Pet. Br. 33\u201341.\nWe hold that neither Fuel Petitioners as to their \nstatutory claims nor State Petitioners as to their EPCA \nclaims establish standing to bring suit, and thus we do \nnot reach the merits of their claims. We reject State \nPetitioners\u2019 constitutional claim on the merits.\nII.\nA.\nWe begin with the question whether either State or \nFuel Petitioners have standing based on their assertions \nthat the waiver will cause them economic injury. Fuel \nPetitioners premise their standing as to the entirety of \ntheir petition for review on their claimed economic injury. \nState Petitioners, meanwhile, premise their standing for \n\n17a\ntheir claim that the waiver is preempted by the EPCA on \ntheir alleged economic injury.\nA \u201cshowing of standing is \u2018an essential and unchanging\u2019 \npredicate to any exercise of our jurisdiction.\u201d Fla. \nAudubon Soc. v. Bentsen, 94 F.3d 658, 663, 320 U.S. App. \nD.C. 324 (D.C. Cir. 1996) (en banc) (quoting Lujan v.

United \nStates, 570 F.3d 316, 324, 386 U.S. App. D.C. 406 (D.C. \nCir. 2009). The \u201cirreducible constitutional minimum of \nstanding contains three elements.\u201d Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560. \nFirst, the plaintiff must have suffered an injury-in-fact\u2014\nan \u201cinvasion of a judicially cognizable interest which is (a) \nconcrete and particularized and (b) actual or imminent, \nnot conjectural or hypothetical.\u201d Bennett v.

Third, \u201cit must be \u2018likely,\u2019 \nas opposed to merely \u2018speculative,\u2019 that the injury will be \n\u2018redressed by a favorable decision.\u2019\u201d Lujan, 504 U.S. at \n561 (quoting Simon v. E. Ky. Welfare Rts. Org., 426 U.S. \n26, 38, 43, 96 S.\u00a0Ct. 1917, 48 L.\u00a0Ed.\u00a02d 450 (1976)).\n\u201cA petitioner bears the burden of establishing each\u201d \nof the elements of standing. Chamber of Com. of U.S. v. \nEPA, 642 F.3d 192, 200, 395 U.S. App. D.C. 193 (D.C. \nCir. 2011). To meet that burden, a petitioner must \u201cshow \n\n18a\na \u2018substantial probability\u2019 that it has been injured, that \nthe defendant caused its injury, and that the court could \nredress that injury.\u201d Sierra Club v. EPA, 292 F.3d 895, \n899, 352 U.S. App. D.C. 191 (D.C. Cir. 2002) (quoting API v. \nUnited States EPA, 216 F.3d 50, 63, 342 U.S. App. D.C. 159 \n(D.C. Cir. 2000)). And a petitioner may not wait to attempt \nto meet its burden of demonstrating standing until after \nthe respondent contests the issue. Rather, absent \u201cgood \ncause shown,\u201d a petitioner whose standing is not readily \napparent must show that it has standing in \u201cits opening \nbrief.\u201d Id. at 900\u201301. A petitioner may carry this \u201cburden \nof production by citing any record evidence relevant to its \nclaim of standing and, if necessary, appending to its filing \nadditional affidavits or other evidence sufficient to support \nits claim.\u201d Id.; see also D.C. Cir. R. 28(a)(7).\nWhether a petitioner has standing to challenge a \nparticular government action depends, in part, upon \nwhether the petitioner is \u201can object of the action\u201d at \nissue. Lujan, 504 U.S. at 561. When a petitioner is an \nobject of the action it seeks to challenge, causation and \nredressability are usually easy to demonstrate. Id. But \nwhen, as here, the petitioner \u201cis not [it]self the object of \nthe government action or inaction he challenges, standing \nis not precluded, but is ordinarily \u2018substantially more \ndifficult\u2019 to establish.\u201d Id. at 562 (quoting Allen v. Wright, \n468 U.S. 737, 758, 104 S.\u00a0Ct. 3315, 82 L.\u00a0Ed.\u00a02d 556 (1984)). \nBecause any injury to petitioners \u201chinges on actions taken \nby manufacturers, the petitioners carry \u2018the burden of \nadduc[ing] facts showing that those [third-party] choices \nhave been or will be made in such manner as to produce \ncausation and permit redressability of injury.\u2019\u201d Chamber \n\n19a\nof Com., 642 F.3d at 201 (alterations in original) (quoting \nCtr. for Biological Diversity v. United States DOI, 563 \nF.3d 466, 477, 385 U.S. App. D.C. 257 (D.C. Cir. 2009)).\nAs we will explain, these principles compel the \nconclusion that both State and Fuel Petitioners lack \nstanding premised on their claimed economic injuries \nbecause neither group of Petitioners has met their burden \nof demonstrating that those injuries are redressable.\nB.\nFuel Petitioners argue that, by requiring vehicle \nmanufacturers to sell vehicles that use less or no liquid \nfuel, California\u2019s LEV and ZEV requirements depress \nthe demand for liquid fuels.7 Fuel Petitioners and their \nmembers, who produce and sell liquid fuels and the \nraw materials used to produce those fuels, are thereby \nfinancially injured by the reduction in demand for those \nproducts. Fuel Pet. Br. 16; Fuel Pet. Reply Br. 3\u20134. In \nsupport of Fuel Petitioners\u2019 contention that they are \neconomically injured by the waiver, Fuel Petitioners \noffer over a dozen declarations by individuals who are \naffiliated with Fuel Petitioner entities and organizations; \nthe individuals explain that the entity or organization is \n7.\u2002 Fuel Petitioners include both associations and individual \nentities. Fuel Pet. Br. 16. Because, as we explain, we conclude that \nall Fuel Petitioners have failed to establish redressability, we need \nnot address whether any of the Fuel Petitioner associations have \nestablished organizational standing. Cf. Sierra Club, 292 F.3d at \n898 (laying out the requirements for establishing organizational \nstanding).\n\n20a\ninvolved with producing or selling fuel and that the waiver \ncauses Fuel Petitioners economic injury by reducing the \ndemand for fuel and related products.\nState Petitioners, meanwhile, allege three financial \ninjuries that they contend are caused by the waiver. \nFirst, the waiver causes manufacturers to increase the \ncost of conventional vehicles elsewhere in the country in \norder to account for the cost of meeting the requirements \nimposed on manufacturers by the waiver granted to \nCalifornia. State Petitioners explain that because they \npurchase conventional vehicles, the increase in the prices \nfor those vehicles that results from the waiver causes \nState Petitioners financial harm. State Pet. Br. 14\u201315. \nSecond, State Petitioners contend that the greater shift \nto electric vehicles that results from the waiver will \ncause State Petitioners to generate less fuel-tax revenue. \nId. Finally, State Petitioners argue that the increase \nin electric vehicles caused by the waiver will affect the \nStates\u2019 electrical grids. In support of their standing \nclaims, State Petitioners offer a declaration from each \nindividual State Petitioner and a declaration from an \neconomist, Benjamin Zycher, Ph.D. Each State Petitioner\u2019s \ndeclaration states that the state purchases conventional \n(that is, gas-or diesel-powered) vehicles. State Pet. \nAdd. 6\u201336. In his declaration, Dr. Zycher contends that \nCalifornia\u2019s ZEV requirement will have several economic \nimpacts on State Petitioners, including an increase in the \ncost of conventional vehicles nationwide, a \u201cdecline in the \nquality of delivered state services,\u201d a reduction in \u201cfuel \ntax revenues available for the provision of highway and \n\n21a\nroad services,\u201d and an \u201cincrease in the costs and prices of \ndelivering electric power services.\u201d State Pet. Add. 38\u201339.\nThe EPA and California both dispute that State \nand Fuel Petitioners\u2019 allegations and evidence establish \ninjury and causation sufficient to support standing. EPA \nBr. 23\u201328 (arguing State Petitioners fail to demonstrate \nstanding); California Br. 9\u201315 (arguing both State and Fuel \nPetitioners fail to demonstrate standing). For example, \nas to causation, California argues that both groups of \nPetitioners fail to demonstrate that their alleged injuries \nare caused by the 2022 waiver reinstatement, rather than \nthe original 2013 waiver or rising consumer demand for \nelectric vehicles more generally. California Br. 11, 14. But \nthis Court need not definitively decide whether either \nset of Petitioners has established injury or causation. \nHowever robust their claims of injury and causation \nare, State and Fuel Petitioners spend considerably less \ntime explaining how those injuries are redressable. \nIndeed, even assuming that both sets of Petitioners have \nestablished injury and causation sufficient for standing, \nPetitioners\u2019 standing arguments fail for the same reason: \nBoth groups of Petitioners fall far short of meeting their \nburden of demonstrating a \u201csubstantial probability\u201d that \ntheir alleged injuries would be redressed by a favorable \ndecision by this Court. Am. Petroleum, 216 F.3d at 63; see \nalso Sierra Club, 292 F.3d at 899\u2013900.\nFuel Petitioners assert in their opening brief\u2014\nwithout explanation or citation\u2014that this Court could \nredress their injuries \u201cby setting aside the action.\u201d Fuel \nPet. Br. 16. Fuel Petitioners\u2019 declarations offer little \n\n22a\nmore; to the extent that Fuel Petitioners\u2019 declarations \ndiscuss redressability at all, the declarations state that \nthe injuries discussed therein \u201cwould be substantially \nameliorated if EPA\u2019s decision were set aside.\u201d State \nPetitioners\u2019 opening brief is similarly conclusory regarding \nredressability. State Petitioners assert that their \u201cinjuries \nare redressable because a judgment setting aside the \nwaiver would eliminate the source of their injuries.\u201d State \nPet. Br. 16. However, none of the declarations submitted \nby State Petitioners with their opening brief addresses \nredressability at all.\nThe difficulty for Fuel and State Petitioners is \nthat their claimed injuries \u201chinge[] on\u201d the actions of \nthird parties\u2014the automobile manufacturers who are \nsubject to the waiver. Chamber of Com., 642 F.3d at \n201. Redressability, too, \u201chinge[s] on the response of\u201d \nthose same automobile manufacturers. Lujan, 504 U.S. \nat 562. Both groups of Petitioners\u2019 injuries would be \nredressed only if automobile manufacturers responded \nto vacatur of the waiver by producing and selling fewer \nnon-conventional vehicles or by altering the prices of their \nvehicles such that fewer non-conventional vehicles\u2014and \nmore conventional vehicles\u2014were sold.\nAnd, aside from turning on the actions of the automobile \nmanufacturers subject to the waiver, redressability is \nfurther complicated by the relatively short duration of \nthe waiver that Petitioners challenge. These petitions \nfor review concern only the EPA\u2019s decision, in March \n2022, to reinstate the waiver it had previously granted \nCalifornia as to Model Years 2017 through 2025. See 2022 \n\n23a\nWaiver Reinstatement Decision, 87 Fed. Reg. 14337. Thus, \nto meet their burden of demonstrating redressability, \nboth sets of Petitioners must demonstrate a \u201csubstantial \nprobability\u201d not only that automobile manufacturers are \nlikely to respond to a decision by this Court by changing \ntheir fleets in a way that alleviates their injuries in some \nway, but also that automobile manufacturers would do so \nrelatively quickly\u2014by Model Year 2025. Am. Petroleum, \n216 F.3d at 63.\nThe record evidence provides no basis for us to \nconclude that manufacturers would, in fact, change course \nwith respect to the relevant model years if this Court were \nto vacate the waiver. To begin, Petitioners fail to point to \nany evidence affirmatively demonstrating that vacatur of \nthe waiver would be substantially likely to result in any \nchange to automobile manufacturers\u2019 vehicle fleets by \nModel Year 2025. The only evidence points in the opposite \ndirection, indicating that automobile manufacturers need \nyears of lead time to make changes to their future model \nyear fleets. In a comment submitted to the EPA during the \nrulemaking process regarding the EPA\u2019s 2019 recission \nof the 2013 waiver, for example, Ford Motor Company \nstated that its product cycle requires several years of \nlead time for planning, and that its \u201cregulatory lead time \n(i.e., awareness of future regulatory requirements)\u201d is \nseven years. J.A. 637. Ford explained that, as a result, \nif the regulatory landscape shifted in some way, \u201clittle \nor nothing could be done to re-optimize the company\u2019s \nproduct plans, which are largely fixed for the next few \nyears.\u201d Id. Further, the record indicates that other \nautomobile manufacturers would also require years \n\n24a\nof lead time to alter their product plans. In comments \nsubmitted to the EPA during the EPA\u2019s rulemaking \nprocess regarding the 2022 waiver reinstatement, Tesla, \nInc. and Toyota Motor North America, Inc., explained \nthat their vehicle product cycles, too, can also begin years \nbefore a vehicle is launched. J.A. 371, 477; see also J.A. \n370 n.5 (summarizing similar statements from Chrysler \nGroup LLC, Hyundai America Technical Center, Inc., \nand Mitsubishi Motors North America). Thus, even \nif automobile manufacturers were inclined to change \ncourse so as to alleviate the Petitioners\u2019 injuries within \nthe given model years, it is far from clear that they could \ndo so within the model years covered by the waiver.8 To \nbe sure, it is possible that manufacturers could change \ntheir prices without modifying their production cycles, \nwhich may redress Petitioners\u2019 injuries because pricing \ncould affect the mix of conventional and electric vehicles \npurchased. But Petitioners point us to no evidence that \nmanufacturers would change their prices by Model Year \n2025 either.\nDespite the paucity of evidence in the record \nregarding the redressability of their injuries, neither \ngroup of Petitioners attempts to explain in any detail \nhow their injuries are redressable, let alone to \u201ccit[e] any \nrecord evidence\u201d or to file \u201cadditional affidavits or other \n8.\u2002 We also note that several automobile manufacturers have \nintervened in support of the EPA in this case. Those manufacturers \nexplain in their brief in support of the EPA that \u201cboth internal \nsustainability goals and external market forces\u201d are prompting \nmanufacturers to transition toward electric vehicles, irrespective \nof California\u2019s regulations.

Nor, for that matter, does either set \nof Petitioners grapple with the relatively short nature of \nthe waiver they challenge. Rather, all Petitioners seem to \nhave treated redressability as a foregone conclusion. See \nCrete Carrier Corp. v. EPA, 363 F.3d 490, 494, 361 U.S. \nApp. D.C. 54 (D.C.

Oral Argument \nTranscript 74; see also Del Monte, 570 F.3d at 325 (\u201c[S]\ntanding is assessed as of the time a suit commences.\u201d). True \nenough. But that does not help Fuel Petitioners: Even \u201cas \nof the time\u201d this lawsuit commenced, Fuel Petitioners had \nfailed to point to any evidence in the record showing that \ntheir alleged injuries were redressable. Del Monte, 570 \nF.3d at 325. Put differently, the flaw in Fuel Petitioners\u2019 \nstanding arguments is not\u2014as counsel for Fuel Petitioners \ncontended at oral argument, Oral Argument Transcript \n74\u201375\u2014that their standing arguments were sufficient \nwhen originally filed, but that their claims have been \nmooted by the passage of time. Fuel Petitioners\u2019 standing \narguments were deficient from the start.\n\n26a\nState Petitioners, meanwhile, argue that, to the \nextent that there is any doubt that they have met their \nburden of demonstrating causation and redressability, this \nCourt should resolve it in their favor given the \u201cspecial \nsolicitude\u201d to which states are entitled when they seek to \nprotect their \u201cquasi-sovereign interests.\u201d Massachusetts \nv. EPA, 549 U.S. 497, 518\u201320, 127 S.\u00a0Ct. 1438, 167 L.\u00a0Ed.\u00a02d \n248 (2007); see also State Pet. Br. 16. We disagree. The \n\u201cspecial solicitude\u201d afforded to states can relax standing \nrequirements only so far. Massachusetts, 549 U.S. at 520. \nEven the \u201cgreater leeway\u201d afforded to states seeking to \nprotect quasi-sovereign interests cannot save defective \nstanding claims when, as here, the record is \u201calmost \ncompletely silent\u201d with respect to an element of a state\u2019s \nstanding. Alaska v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Agric., 17 F.4th 1224, \n1230, 454 U.S. App. D.C. 493 (D.C. Cir. 2021).\nState and Fuel Petitioners\u2019 sparse treatment of \nredressability is particularly surprising because, in a \nprevious case, this Court noted that it could not presume \nredressability in essentially the same circumstances. \nIn Chamber of Commerce of the United States v. EPA, \nthe Chamber of Commerce and the National Automobile \nDealers Association, on behalf of their automobile dealer \nmembers, petitioned for review in this Court of the EPA\u2019s \ndecision to grant California a waiver, under Section 209(b), \nwith respect to automobile Model Years 2009 through 2016. \n642 F.3d at 196\u201397. There, the petitioners\u2014automobile \ndealers who, like the Petitioners in this case, were not \ndirectly subject to the waiver\u2014explained that automobile \nmanufacturers\u2019 responses to the waiver injured them in \ntwo ways. First, automobile manufacturers would respond \n\n27a\nto the waiver by altering the mix of vehicles they sold in \nCalifornia and other states; as a result, vehicle dealers \nwould be injured because they would be unable to obtain \nspecific vehicles that their customers wanted to buy. Id. at \n201. And second, the California standards would increase \nautomobile manufacturers\u2019 costs and, in turn, increase \nthe prices of the automobiles they manufactured. Id. The \nautomobile dealers believed they would be injured by those \nincreased vehicle costs because they would have to choose \nwhether to keep their prices the same, and accordingly \nlower their profit margins, or to increase their prices \nto account for the increased vehicle costs, at the risk of \nturning away customers. Id.\nThe Chamber of Commerce Court ultimately resolved \npetitioners\u2019 claims on mootness grounds, not standing. \nId. at 204, 206. But before reaching that conclusion, the \nCourt expressed serious doubts that the petitioners \nhad met their burden of demonstrating redressability. \nId. at 205. The record before the Court indicated that \nvacatur of the challenged waiver may not result in any \nchange on the part of automobile manufacturers. And, \nthe Court noted, \u201cPetitioners ha[d] offered no evidence \nto the contrary, and no evidence that, if the waiver were \nvacated, [automobile manufacturers] would proceed on \na different course more favorable to the petitioners.\u201d Id. \nat 205\u201306. So even if petitioners\u2019 claims were not moot, \ntheir failure to introduce redressability evidence made \nit\u2014at a minimum\u2014rather unclear whether their claims \nwere redressable.\nAs the EPA and intervenors correctly recognize, \nState and Fuel Petitioners\u2019 standing submissions run into \n\n28a\nprecisely the same problem here. In its response brief, \nthe EPA explains in some detail how State Petitioners \nhave failed to substantiate the redressability of their \ninjuries. EPA Br. 26. California, meanwhile, argues that \nneither group of Petitioners has provided any evidence \nthat vacatur would remedy their injuries. California \nBr. 13. Further underlining the point, California offers \nan expert declaration by Joshua M. Cunningham, \nthe Chief of the Advanced Clean Cars Branch of the \nCalifornia Air Resources Board, who explains in \nspecific terms why the Petitioners\u2019 claims are unlikely \nto be redressed by a favorable decision by this Court. \nCalifornia Add. 84\u201385; 96\u201399. Cunningham explains that \nautomobile manufacturers have already made a number \nof public commitments regarding both vehicle pricing \nand availability with respect to the remaining model \nyears covered by the challenged waiver; those public \ncommitments would tend to suggest that neither group \nof Petitioners\u2019 claims are redressable. As Cunningham \nputs it, \u201cmanufacturers have likely already made pricing \ndecisions for\u201d the remaining model years. California \nAdd. 96. Cunningham also states that \u201cmanufacturers \nare already selling more qualifying vehicles in California \nthan the State\u2019s standards require,\u201d suggesting that \nvacatur of the zero-emission vehicle mandate would not \nredress Petitioners\u2019 injuries. California Add. 98. Indeed, \nrecord evidence supports the fact that manufacturers \nalready exceed California\u2019s ZEV requirements. See J.A. \n300\u201302. Yet despite these arguments against their theory \nof redressability, neither State nor Fuel Petitioners \nmeaningfully addressed the redressability of their \n\n29a\neconomic injuries in their reply briefs.9 State Pet. Reply \nBr. 3, Fuel Pet. Reply Br. 3\u20136.\nUltimately, the record evidence, coupled with the \nfilings of the EPA and intervenors, provide this Court \nwith no basis to conclude that Petitioners\u2019 claims are \nredressable\u2014a necessary element of standing that \nPetitioners bear the burden of establishing. As in Chamber \nof Commerce, \u201cPetitioners have offered no evidence to \nthe contrary, and no evidence that, if the waiver were \nvacated, [automobile manufacturers] would proceed on \na different course more favorable to the petitioners.\u201d \n642 F.3d at 205. Rather, both State and Fuel Petitioners \n\u201coffer only assertions, not facts, to support their claims \nabout the likely response\u201d of automobile manufacturers \nto a favorable decision by this Court. Crete Carrier Corp., \n363 F.3d at 494.

That proposed supplemental evidence, however, \nconcerned only State Petitioners\u2019 allegations of economic injuries \nstemming from the waiver, not the redressability of those injuries. \nECF 2019756. At any rate, the evidence was too late. See D.C. Cir. \nR. 28(a)(7).\n10.\u2002 We conclude that Petitioners have failed to introduce \nsufficient evidence to raise a dispute of fact as to whether changes \nto the remaining model year fleets are substantially likely if \nvacatur were to occur, so we have no need to refer this to a district \njudge or special master as a disputed factual issue for resolution \nbefore making our ruling on redressability. See FCC v. ITT World \n\n30a\ninjuries are redressable and expect this Court to take \nthem at their word.

We accordingly hold that both State and \nFuel Petitioners lack standing premised on their economic \ninjuries because they have failed to meet their burdens of \ndemonstrating that their claims are redressable.\nC.\nAfter oral argument, Fuel Petitioners filed a motion \nto supplement the record and to file a supplemental brief \nregarding their standing.

Fuel \nPetitioners contend that the EPA and California raised for \nthe first time at oral argument the question whether Fuel \nPetitioners\u2019 claims could be redressed within the relevant \nmodel years\u2014an issue Fuel Petitioners argue pertains \nto mootness, not the redressability of their claims.

We \nhave found \u201cgood cause\u201d when, for example, \u201c\u2019the parties \nreasonably, but mistakenly, believed\u2019 that they \u2018sufficiently \ndemonstrated standing\u2019 or when they \u2018reasonably assumed \nthat their standing was self-evident.\u2019\u201d Nat\u2019l Council for \nAdoption, 4 F.4th at 111 (quoting Twin Rivers Paper Co. \nLLC v. SEC, 934 F.3d 607, 614, 443 U.S. App. D.C. 74 (D.C. \nCir. 2019)).\nNo such good cause exists here. We do not think Fuel \nPetitioners could have reasonably believed that they had \nadequately demonstrated standing or that their standing \nwas \u201cself-evident\u201d from the record when they filed their \nopening brief. Twin Rivers, 934 F.3d at 614. As this \nCourt and the Supreme Court have repeatedly explained, \nredressability is \u201c\u2019substantially more difficult\u2019 to establish\u201d \nwhen, as here, Petitioners are not directly regulated by \nthe government action they seek to challenge. Lujan, 504 \nU.S. at 562 (quoting Allen, 468 U.S. at 758). Indeed, as \nnoted above, this Court has previously expressed doubt \nthat petitioners seeking to challenge a Section 209 waiver \nhad demonstrated redressability where they had failed to \nput any such evidence in the record. Chamber of Com., 642 \nF.3d at 205. And Fuel Petitioners should have been aware \nthat redressability may pose a particularly challenging \nobstacle here, considering the relatively narrow \n\n32a\ntimeframe of the particular waiver Petitioners challenge \nand the evidence in the record showing that automobile \nmanufacturers generally require years of lead time to \nmake changes to their future model year fleets. Yet Fuel \nPetitioners failed to meaningfully address redressability \nin their opening brief at all, either by \u201cidentify[ing] .\u00a0.\u00a0. \nrecord evidence\u201d or by offering the Court evidence of their \nown. Sierra Club, 292 F.3d at 899.\nSecond, even if Fuel Petitioners reasonably believed \nthat their standing was \u201cself-evident\u201d when they filed their \nopening brief, Petitioners offer no explanation for having \nfailed to address redressability in their reply brief after \nCalifornia raised the issue in its opposition brief. Twin \nRivers, 934 F.3d at 614. In this respect, Fuel Petitioners\u2019 \nmotion relies on a false premise: Oral argument was \nplainly not the first time that California argued that \nFuel Petitioners had failed to demonstrate redressability. \nRather, as we have explained, California explicitly argued \nthat Fuel Petitioners had offered no evidence regarding \nthe redressability of their injuries, and California \nprovided the Court with a declaration that addressed \nthe point. Having failed even to attempt to respond to \nCalifornia\u2019s arguments regarding redressability at the \nreply stage, Fuel Petitioners provide this Court with no \nreason to allow them to do so now.\nIII.\nState Petitioners also argue that the EPA\u2019s 2022 \ndecision is \u201ccontrary to constitutional right\u201d under 5 \nU.S.C. \u00a7\u00a0706(2)(B) because Section 209(b) of the Clean Air \n\n33a\nAct is unconstitutional. They rely on the equal sovereignty \nprinciple, which the Supreme Court applied in Shelby \nCounty v. Holder, 570 U.S. 529, 133 S.\u00a0 Ct. 2612, 186 \nL.\u00a0Ed.\u00a02d 651 (2013), to hold that Fifteenth Amendment \nlegislation that disparately impacts states\u2019 control over \nvoting procedures must be \u201csufficiently related to the \nproblem it targets.\u201d Id. at 542 (quoting Nw. Austin Mun. \nUtil. Dist. No. One v. Holder, 557 U.S. 193, 203, 129 S.\u00a0Ct. \n2504, 174 L.\u00a0Ed.\u00a02d 140 (2009)). State Petitioners argue \nthat this principle also categorically prohibits Congress \nfrom using its Commerce Clause power in a way that \nwithdraws sovereign authority from some states but not \nothers. And Section 209(b), they say, violates that principle \nby preempting the authority of every state but California \nto regulate motor vehicle emissions. We conclude that \nState Petitioners have standing to raise this constitutional \nclaim, but we join the two other circuits to have considered \nthe issue in rejecting State Petitioners\u2019 request to extend \nthe equal sovereignty principle in this fashion. See NCAA \nv. Governor of New Jersey, 730 F.3d 208, 239 (3d Cir. 2013), \nabrogated on other grounds by Murphy v.

Cir. \n2003). Assuming State Petitioners\u2019 constitutional theory \nis correct, Section 209(b) and the EPA\u2019s 2022 decision \n\n34a\nviolate their constitutionally protected interest in equal \nsovereignty by leaving them with less regulatory authority \nover vehicle emissions than California. This claimed \ninjury is akin to the type of dignitary injury recognized \nin equal protection cases. Heckler v. Mathews, 465 U.S. \n728, 739\u201340, 104 S.\u00a0Ct. 1387, 79 L.\u00a0Ed.\u00a02d 646 (1984). And, \nState Petitioners argue, invalidating the decision would \nredress that injury and restore their sovereign equality \nby removing California\u2019s greater authority.\nRespondents resist that analysis on the ground that \nState Petitioners do not ask this court to increase their \nown sovereign authority over motor vehicle emissions. \nThe States instead seek to reduce California\u2019s authority.\nThe Supreme Court has repeatedly held, however, that \nthis type of \u201cleveling down\u201d remedy is sufficient to support \nstanding when a party asserts a constitutional right to \nequality. As the Court has put it, \u201cwhen the \u2018right invoked \nis that to equal treatment,\u2019 the appropriate remedy \nis a mandate of equal treatment, a result that can be \naccomplished by withdrawal of benefits from the favored \nclass as well as by extension of benefits to the excluded \nclass.\u201d Heckler, 465 U.S. at 740 (quoting Iowa-Des Moines \nNat\u2019l Bank v.

But Respondents \nhave not identified\u2014and we do not perceive\u2014any material \nreason to treat the right to equal sovereignty claimed here \n\n35a\nany differently for standing purposes.11 And under the \nlogic of the Equal Protection cases, holding Section 209(b) \nunconstitutional and vacating the waiver would redress the \nclaimed constitutional injury by leaving all states equally \npositioned, in that none could regulate vehicle emissions. \nAccordingly, unlike with their asserted economic injuries, \nState Petitioners\u2019 asserted constitutional injury can be \nredressed even absent evidence that manufacturers will \nchange their plans before the waiver expires.12\n11.\u2002 Although we find State Petitioners\u2019 claimed dignitary \nharm sufficiently analogous in kind for purposes of standing, we do \nnot suggest that this harm is commensurate with equal protection \ninjuries based on the perpetuation of \u201carchaic and stereotypic \nnotions\u201d and stigmatization of members \u201cof [a] disfavored group as \n\u2018innately inferior.\u2019\u201d Heckler, 465 U.S. at 739 (quoting Miss.

The Supreme Court has held that the Constitution \ncontains a \u201cfundamental principle of equal sovereignty.\u201d \nShelby County, 570 U.S. at 544. But neither the Supreme \nCourt nor any other court has ever applied that principle as \na limit on the Commerce Clause or other Article I powers. \nAs explained below, the rationale of Shelby County and the \ncases on which it relied in fact suggests that the principle \nimposes no such limit. The parties\u2019 remaining arguments \nconfirm that conclusion. We therefore hold that Section \n209(b) is subject to traditional rational basis review for \nCommerce Clause legislation and\u2014as no one disputes\u2014\nthat it is constitutional under that standard.\nShelby County addressed the constitutionality of the \nVoting Rights Act\u2019s (\u201cVRA\u201d) coverage formula, which \nrequired some but not all states to obtain approval from \nfederal authorities before enacting voting-related laws, a \nprocess known as preclearance. Id. at 536\u201337. The Court \ndid not disturb South Carolina v. Katzenbach, 383 U.S. \n301, 86 S.\u00a0Ct. 803, 15 L.\u00a0Ed.\u00a02d 769 (1966), which held that \nthe coverage formula in the Voting Rights Act of 1965 was \nconstitutional because it was \u201crational in both practice \nand theory.\u201d Shelby County, 570 U.S. at 550 (quoting \nKatzenbach, 383 U.S. at 330); see also id. at 550\u201351 \n(discussing the exceptional circumstances that supported \nKatzenbach\u2019s conclusion). Instead, the core question in \nShelby County was whether Congress had sufficient \njustification for continuing to subject those states to the \npreclearance requirement in its 2006 reauthorization of \n\n37a\nthe Voting Rights Act. Id. The Supreme Court relied in \npart on the \u201cfundamental principle of equal sovereignty,\u201d \nid. at 544, to hold that the VRA\u2019s coverage formula was \nunconstitutional because it was founded on \u201cdecades-old \ndata and eradicated practices,\u201d id. at 551, instead of being \ntailored to \u201ccurrent conditions,\u201d id. at 557. The Court did \nnot outright reject the coverage formula for treating states \ndifferently; instead, it held that the formula\u2019s \u201cdisparate \ngeographic coverage\u201d was not \u201csufficiently related to \nthe problem that it targets.\u201d Id. at 550\u201351 (quoting Nw. \nAustin, 557 U.S. at 203).\nState Petitioners do not ask us to apply Shelby \nCounty\u2019s test that a statute\u2019s \u201cdisparate geographic \ncoverage\u201d must be \u201csufficiently related to the problem that \nit targets.\u201d State Pet.

First, \nthe central debate in Shelby County was the scope of \nCongress\u2019s power to enforce the Fifteenth Amendment \n\u201cby appropriate legislation.\u201d 570 U.S. at 536 (quoting U.S. \nConst. amend. XV). The Court used equal sovereignty \nas a background principle in applying that phrase. Id. \nat 544\u201345. State Petitioners confirm that textual link in \ntheir brief to us, arguing that Shelby County means that \n\u201cin deciding whether such legislation was \u2018appropriate,\u2019 \ncourts must consult the background principle of equal \nsovereignty.\u201d State Pet. Br. 24.\nBut unlike the Fifteenth Amendment, Congress\u2019s \nCommerce Clause power is not limited to \u201cappropriate \nlegislation.\u201d The Commerce Clause instead declares \nunconditionally that Congress has the power \u201cto regulate \ncommerce with foreign nations, among states, and with \nthe Indian tribes.\u201d U.S. Const. art.

State Pet. Br. 26\u201327. Such a law would \nfit with State Petitioners\u2019 categorical theory because it would not \n\u201cdeny sovereign authority to any State capable of exercising it.\u201d State \nPet. Reply Br. 14. As the example indicates, this suggestion is not \nsubstantively different from the theory that the equal sovereignty \nprinciple imposes a categorical limit on Congress\u2019s Commerce Clause \nauthority, and we therefore do not address it separately.\n\n39a\nSurface Mining & Reclamation Ass\u2019n, 452 U.S. 264, 276, \n101 S.\u00a0Ct. 2352, 69 L.\u00a0Ed.\u00a02d 1 (1981), and \u201cacknowledges \nno limitations\u201d other than those \u201cprescribed in the \nconstitution\u201d and \u201cexpressed in plain terms,\u201d Gibbons v. \nOgden, 22 U.S. 1, 196, 6 L.\u00a0Ed. 23 (1824).\nSecond, in requiring that the VRA\u2019s coverage formula \nbe sufficiently related to the problem it targets, Shelby \nCounty repeatedly emphasized that the VRA was \n\u201cextraordinary,\u201d 570 U.S. at 536, because it intruded on \nstates\u2019 power to regulate elections, a \u201csensitive area of \nstate and local policymaking,\u201d id. at 545 (quoting Lopez \nv.

Id. at 555.\nSection 209(b) is not \u201cextraordinary\u201d in that way. The \nConstitution places regulation of all matters affecting \ninterstate commerce\u2014including vehicle emissions\u2014\nsquarely within Congress\u2019s domain, not that of the states. \nSee Miss.

Indeed, in discussing \n\n40a\nthe Constitution\u2019s assignment to Congress of control over \ninterstate commerce the Court has stressed that \u201c[n]o other \nfederal power was so universally assumed to be necessary\u201d \nand \u201cno other state power was so readily relinquished.\u201d \nH.

Accordingly, no one \nquestions that Congress could readily preempt all states \nfrom regulating motor vehicle emissions, or that Congress \nitself could set different vehicle emissions standards for \ndifferent regions of the country. See Sec\u2019y of Agric. v. Cent. \nRoig Refin.

Shelby County does not support requiring a \nheightened justification for disparate intrusions into \nareas over which the Constitution grants Congress such \ncomprehensive control. As the Third Circuit put it, \u201cthere \nis nothing in Shelby County to indicate that the equal \nsovereignty principle is meant to apply with the same force \noutside the context of \u2018sensitive areas of state and local \npolicymaking.\u2019\u201d NCAA, 730 F.3d at 239 (quoting Shelby \nCounty, 570 U.S. at 545).\nFurther, State Petitioners ask us not only to venture \nbeyond the bounds Shelby County set for the equal \nsovereignty principle but also to dramatically increase \nits force. Recall that Shelby County did not establish \na categorical bar against Congress leaving states \nwith different levels of sovereign authority even in the \ntraditionally state-dominated context of voting; it required \nonly that Congress show the disparate treatment is \n\n41a\n\u201csufficiently related to the problem that it targets.\u201d 570 \nU.S. at 550\u201351 (quoting Nw. Austin, 557 U.S. at 204). \nIndeed, the Court reaffirmed Katzenbach\u2019s holding that \nCongress could do so with sufficient evidence. Id. Yet \nState Petitioners ask us to hold that the equal sovereignty \nprinciple operates as a categorical bar against treating \nstates differently in the context of Commerce Clause \nlegislation. State Pet. Br. 28\u201329; State Pet. Reply Br. \n10\u201311. Given that the Constitution grants Congress \nprimacy over interstate commerce, that would be a highly \ncounterintuitive conclusion.\nState Petitioners also rely on a series of cases known \nas the equal footing cases, which Shelby County cited as \napplying the equal sovereignty principle. See 570 U.S. \nat 544. Those cases involved congressional attempts to \nplace limits on new states as a condition of admission \nto the Union and identified \u201cequal sovereignty\u201d as an \n\u201cattribute .\u00a0.\u00a0. guaranteed to\u201d each state \u201cupon admission.\u201d \nUnited States v. Louisiana, 363 U.S. 1, 16, 80 S.\u00a0Ct. \n961, 4 L.\u00a0Ed.\u00a02d 1025 (1960), supplemented sub nom. \nUnited States v. Louisiana, 382 U.S. 288, 86 S.\u00a0Ct. 419, \n15 L.\u00a0Ed.\u00a02d 331 (1965). For example, Coyle v. Smith, 221 \nU.S. 559, 31 S.\u00a0Ct. 688, 55 L.\u00a0Ed. 853 (1911), held that \nCongress had no authority to prohibit Oklahoma from \nmoving its state capital as a condition of admission into \nthe United States. Id. at 567\u201368. The Court\u2019s opinion \naddressed whether Congress\u2019s power to admit new \nstates into the Union allowed such a condition, which was \nconcededly beyond any of Congress\u2019s other enumerated \npowers. Id. The Court explained that Congress could not \nuse its admission power to require a new state to give up \n\n42a\nan aspect of sovereignty that the thirteen original states \nretained. Id. To do so, the Court concluded, would create \na \u201cunion of states unequal in power, as including states \nwhose powers were restricted only by the Constitution, \nwith others whose powers had been further restricted by \nan act of Congress accepted as a condition of admission.\u201d \nId. at 567. State Petitioners here seize on that and similar \nlanguage to support their argument that the equal \nsovereignty principle must mean Congress generally has \nno power to legislate in ways that leave the states with \nunequal sovereign authority.\nThe equal footing cases, however, do not directly \napply either outside of the admission context or to Article \nI powers like the Commerce Clause. Shelby County \nitself reaffirmed prior holdings that the doctrine is not \na \u201cbar on differential treatment outside th[e] context\u201d of \nstates\u2019 admission into the Union. 570 U.S. at 544. Shelby \nCounty, of course, drew on the equal footing cases and \nconcluded that the principle of equal sovereignty they \ndiscuss remained \u201chighly pertinent\u201d in the context of that \ncase. Id. But for all the reasons explained above, Shelby \nCounty does not extend the principle even further to any \n(let alone all) Article I legislation.\nThe equal footing cases themselves also support that \nconclusion. Those cases contemplated\u2014though, to be \nsure, only in dicta\u2014that even if Congress treated states \ndifferently at the time of admission, it would not violate \nthe equal footing guarantee so long as it acted within the \nscope of its plenary powers over interstate commerce. \nThe Court suggested in Coyle that Congress could treat \nstates differently if\u2014instead of using its admission \n\n43a\npower\u2014it enacted \u201clegislation intended as a regulation \nof commerce,\u201d because to do that would be acting \u201cwithin \nthe sphere of the plain power of Congress.\u201d 221 U.S. at \n574; see also id. at 572\u201374; Pollard v. Hagan, 44 U.S. 212, \n229\u201330, 11 L.\u00a0Ed. 565 (1845). Such a condition would not \nput states on an impermissibly unequal footing because it \n\u201cwould not operate to restrict the state\u2019s legislative power \nin respect of any matter which was not plainly within the \nregulating power of Congress.\u201d Coyle, 221 U.S. at 574. \nAccordingly, the equal footing cases fit neatly with the \nconclusion that the equal sovereignty principle is not a \ncategorical bar on Congress deploying its plenary power \nover interstate commerce in ways that differentially affect \nstates\u2019 legislative power.\nThe parties also debate whether State Petitioners\u2019 \ntheory is supported by the Constitution\u2019s text, founding \nera history, and law of nations principles. We address \neach in turn and conclude these other indicators of \nconstitutional meaning do not support State Petitioners\u2019 \ntheory.\nThe Constitution does not contain any textual provision \nsuggesting an equal sovereignty limit on Congress\u2019s \nArticle I powers generally or on the Commerce Clause in \nparticular. As already discussed, the Commerce Clause \nis a plenary grant of authority to regulate interstate \ncommerce which the Supreme Court has held is subject \nonly to those limitations \u201cprescribed in the constitution\u201d \nand \u201cexpressed in plain terms.\u201d Gibbons, 22 U.S. at 196.\nTo the extent the Constitution\u2019s text sheds light on \nthe question, it appears to cut against State Petitioners, \n\n44a\nbecause the Constitution does impose certain equality-\nbased limitations on other Article I powers. For example, \nthe text of Article I, Section 8 states that laws concerning \nbankruptcy, naturalization, and duties shall be \u201cuniform.\u201d \nSee U.S. Const. art. I, \u00a7\u00a08, cl. 1, cl. 4. Similarly, Article \nI, Section 9 prohibits \u201c[p]reference .\u00a0 .\u00a0 . given by any \nRegulation of Commerce or Revenue to the Ports of one \nState over those of another.\u201d U.S. Const. art. I, \u00a7\u00a09, cl. 6. \nState Petitioners argue that these textual provisions do \nnot suggest the absence of a general equal sovereignty \nlimit on Article I. As they point out, these provisions speak \nonly to whether Congress can treat states differently \nwhen Congress itself does the legislating, not whether \nCongress can allow some but not other states to exercise \nthe sovereign authority to legislate on an issue. That is, the \nprovisions guarantee the states equal treatment for only \nspecific subjects rather than equal sovereignty for only \nthose subjects. The key for present purposes, however, \nis that even though the Founders plainly knew how to \ninclude equality-based protections for states in Article I \nwhen they wished to, they did not include any mention of \nState Petitioners\u2019 broad equal sovereignty principle. The \nfact that some constitutional clauses explicitly contain an \nequality-based guarantee therefore supports a negative \ninference\u2014though perhaps only a mild one\u2014that the \nCommerce Clause is not so constrained.\nThere are, of course, \u201cconstitutional doctrines \nthat are not spelled out in the Constitution but are \nnevertheless implicit in its structure and supported by \nhistorical practice,\u201d such as the doctrine of state sovereign \nimmunity. Franchise Tax Bd. v. Hyatt, 139 S.\u00a0Ct. 1485, \n\n45a\n1498\u201399, 203 L.\u00a0Ed.\u00a02d 768 (2019). That category also \nincludes limits on the Commerce Clause, such as the Tenth \nAmendment anticommandeering doctrine, which are \nsupported by the historical context in which our federal \nstructure was created. See New York v. United States, \n505 U.S. 144, 163\u201366, 112 S.\u00a0Ct. 2408, 120 L.\u00a0Ed.\u00a02d 120 \n(1992) (discussing founding era debates supporting the \nanticommandeering doctrine). The evidence the parties \nprovide from the founding era, however, does not show \nthat State Petitioners\u2019 version of the equal sovereignty \nprinciple has a comparable historical pedigree. It is true, \nas State Petitioners urge, that the general subject of state \nsovereignty and the states\u2019 relation to each other and the \nnew federal government was a core focus at the founding. \nDespite that focus, however, State Petitioners have \nidentified no evidence that the Founders contemplated the \ntype of inviolable equal state sovereignty State Petitioners \nask us to announce.\nThe equal sovereignty debate at the founding centered \non how states would be represented in Congress, with the \nsmaller states arguing for equal representation for each \nstate and the larger states seeking \u201cequality for each \nvoter\u201d in the form of proportional representation. See \nWesberry v. Sanders, 376 U.S. 1, 11-14, 84 S.\u00a0Ct. 526, 11 \nL.\u00a0Ed.\u00a02d 481 (1964) (summarizing the Great Compromise \ndebates); Letter from James Madison to Thomas Jefferson \n(Oct. 24, 1787), in 12 The Papers of Thomas Jefferson \n270, 279 (Julian P. Boyd ed., 1955) (discussing how the \n\u201clittle States insisted on retaining their equality in both \nbranches\u201d while the \u201clarge states .\u00a0.\u00a0. urged that as the \nnew Government was to be drawn principally from the \n\n46a\npeople immediately\u201d). For example, New Jersey delegate \nWilliam Paterson used the concept of \u201cequal sovereignty\u201d \nto support his argument for a single legislative chamber \nwith an equal vote for each state. Wesberry, 376 U.S. at 11 \n(citing 3 The Records of the Federal Convention of 1787, \nat 251 (Max Farrand ed., 1911)). Eventually, these debates \nled to the Great Compromise, which established two forms \nof equality central to Article I: \u201cequal sovereignty\u201d in \nthe Senate in the form of equal representation for each \nstate and equal representation for each voter in the \nHouse in the form of proportional representation. U.S. \nConst. art. I, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a02, 3; see also The Federalist No. 39, at \n255 (James Madison) (Jacob E. Cooke ed., 1961). The \nFounders\u2019 preoccupation with the manner and extent of \nstate equality under the Constitution also appears to have \nyielded the specific equality-based limits on Congress\u2019s \nlegislative authority discussed above. If the Constitution \nalso contained State Petitioners\u2019 fundamental yet unstated \nlimit on Congress\u2019s authority to legislate, one would expect \nample historical evidence of that limit at the founding. \nState Petitioners point us to none. Cf. New York, 505 U.S. \nat 163\u201366.\nIn fact, as State Petitioners admit, the Constitution \nincludes one provision that expressly allows Congress to \nenhance the sovereign authority of some states without \ngranting that authority equally to all states. State Pet. \nReply Br. 10. Article I, Section 10 provides that \u201cNo State \nshall, without the Consent of Congress, lay any Duty of \nTonnage, keep Troops, or Ships of War in time of Peace, \nenter into any Agreement or Compact with another \nState, or with a foreign Power.\u201d U.S. Const. art. I, \u00a7\u00a010, \n\n47a\ncl. 3. That is, Congress has the power to grant individual \nstates greater authority to, for example, assess taxes and \neven enter compacts with foreign powers\u2014indisputably \nelements of \u201csovereignty\u201d\u2014without extending the same \nauthority to other states. See Wheeling, P. & C. Transp. \nCo. v. City of Wheeling, 99 U.S. 273, 283, 25 L.\u00a0Ed. 412 \n(1878) (\u201cTaxation, beyond all doubt, is the exercise of a \nsovereign power.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u201d); Cuyler v.

Early Congresses used Article I, Section 10 \nin this very manner, granting specific states legislative \nauthority to impose tonnage duties. See, e.g., Act of Feb. \n9, 1791, ch. 5, 1 Stat. 190 (consenting to Maryland statute \nimposing duty at Port of Baltimore); Act of Aug. 11, 1790, \nch. 43, 1 Stat. 184 (consenting to Georgia, Maryland, and \nRhode Island statutes imposing tonnage duties). If this \nprovision were\u2014as State Petitioners would have it\u2014a \nlimited exception to an otherwise generally applicable \nequal sovereignty guarantee implicit in the Constitution, \nwe would expect to see some founding era discussion \nof how the provision interacts with that broader equal \nsovereignty principle. Yet State Petitioners identify no \nevidence of that either.\nThe only affirmative support State Petitioners identify \nfor their theory comes from law of nations principles. \nThey argue that the Founders expected international \nlaw of nations principles to govern the states and that \nthose principles included a notion of equal sovereignty \n\n48a\nthat would render federal legislation unconstitutional if \nit treated states differently. State. Pet. Br. 18; State Pet. \nReply Br. 12 (\u201cAt the founding, the law of nations entitled \nall sovereigns to perfect equality.\u201d (internal quotation \nmarks omitted)). That argument is unpersuasive. \nInternational law contained no analog for the relation in \nour constitutional system between the federal government \nand the states, and so it would be surprising if the law of \nnations dictated limits on Congress\u2019s authority in relation \nto the states. And, as it turns out, the Supreme Court has \neffectively explained that the Constitution\u2019s Supremacy \nClause defeats State Petitioners\u2019 reasoning. In Gibbons, \nthe Court held that while states may have equal sovereign \nauthority to regulate commerce in the absence of federal \naction, that authority is \u201csubjected .\u00a0.\u00a0. to the superior \npower of Congress\u201d when Congress acts. 22 U.S. at 70. \nIndeed, the Gibbons Court cited the very same law of \nnations principles that State Petitioners rely on, but only \nto describe the relationship between the states when \nCongress has not acted pursuant to its commerce power. \nId. at 69\u201370. No case since Gibbons has said otherwise.\nThe nature and extent of equality between the states \nhas been a central debate throughout our country\u2019s \nhistory, from the founding to the admission of new \nstates and beyond. But State Petitioners point us to \nno meaningful support for their novel request to apply \nthe equal sovereignty principle as a categorical limit on \nCongress\u2019s power to regulate interstate commerce. The \nFirst and Third Circuits\u2014the only appellate courts to \nhave considered similar arguments\u2014have found Shelby \nCounty\u2019s discussion of the equal sovereignty principle \ninapplicable to Commerce Clause and Spending Clause \nlegislation for similar reasons. See NCAA, 730 F.3d at \n\n49a\n238\u201339 (Commerce Clause); Mayhew, 772 F.3d at 95 \n(Spending Clause).\nSection 209(b) is subject to the rational basis review \nnormally applied to Commerce Clause legislation. See \nHodel, 452 U.S. at 276\u201377. And because State Petitioners \npresent no argument that Section 209(b) or the waiver \nat issue cannot survive that review, we reject their \nconstitutional challenge.\nState Petitioners\u2019 request to set aside the \nAdministrator\u2019s decision on these grounds is denied.\nSo ordered. \n\n50a\nAPPENDIX B\nENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY\n[EPA-HQ-OAR-2021-0257; FRL-9325-01-OAR]\nCalifornia State Motor Vehicle Pollution Control \nStandards; Advanced Clean Car Program; \nReconsideration of a Previous Withdrawal of a \nWaiver of Preemption; Notice of Decision\nAGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency.\nACTION: Notice of decision.\nSUMMARY: The Environmental Protection Agency \n(EPA) has completed the reconsideration of its 2019 \naction withdrawing a 2013 Clean Air Act (CAA) waiver \nof preemption for California\u2019s greenhouse gas (GHG) \nemission standards and zero emission vehicle (ZEV) \nsale mandate, which are part of California\u2019s Advanced \nClean Car (ACC) program.

In addition, EPA is withdrawing \nthe interpretive view of CAA section 177 included in its \n2019 action, that States may not adopt California\u2019s GHG \nstandards pursuant to section 177 even if EPA has granted \nCalifornia a waiver for such standards.

Statutory and Executive Order Reviews\n\n55a\nI.\t Executive Summary\nCAA section 209(a) generally preempts states from \nadopting emission control standards for new motor \nvehicles. But Congress created an important exception \nfrom preemption. Under CAA section 209(b), the State \nof California1 may seek a waiver of preemption, and EPA \nmust grant it unless the Agency makes one of three \nstatutory findings. California\u2019s waiver of preemption \nfor its motor vehicle emissions standards allows other \nStates to adopt and enforce identical standards pursuant \nto CAA section 177. Since the CAA was enacted, EPA \nhas granted California dozens of waivers of preemption, \npermitting California to enforce its own motor vehicle \nemission standards. \nOf particular relevance to this action, in 2013, EPA \ngranted California\u2019s waiver request for the state\u2019s \nAdvanced Clean Car (ACC) program (ACC program \nwaiver).2 California\u2019s ACC program includes both a \nLow Emission Vehicle (LEV) program, which regulates \ncriteria pollutants and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, \nas well as a Zero Emission Vehicle (ZEV) sales mandate. \nThese two requirements are designed to control smog- and \nsoot-causing pollutants and GHG emissions in a single \n1.\u2002  The CAA section 209(b) waiver is limited \u201cto any State \nwhich has adopted standards . . . for the control of emissions from \nnew motor vehicles or new motor vehicle engines prior to March 30, \n1966,\u201d and California is the only State that had standards in place \nbefore that date. \u201cCalifornia\u201d and \u201cCalifornia Air Resources Board\u201d \n(CARB) are used interchangeably in certain instances in this notice \nwhen referring to the waiver process under section 209(b). \n2.\u2002  78 FR 2111 (January 9, 2013). \n\n56a\ncoordinated package of requirements for passenger cars, \nlight-duty trucks, and medium-duty passenger vehicles \n(as well as limited requirements related to heavy-duty \nvehicles). Between 2013 and 2019, twelve other States \nadopted one or both of California\u2019s standards as their own. \nBut in 2019, EPA partially withdrew this waiver as part of \na final action entitled \u201cThe Safer Affordable Fuel-Efficient \n(SAFE) Vehicles Rule Part One: One National Program\u201d \n(SAFE 1), marking the first time the agency withdrew \na previously granted waiver.3 In addition, in the context \nof SAFE 1, EPA provided an interpretive view of CAA \nsection 177 asserting that other states were precluded \nfrom adopting California\u2019s GHG standards. \nAs Administrator of the Environmental Protection \nAgency (EPA), I am now rescinding EPA\u2019s 2019 actions in \nSAFE 1 that partially withdrew the ACC program waiver \nfor California\u2019s ACC program. I am rescinding these \nactions because (1) EPA\u2019s reconsideration of the waiver \nunder the particular facts and circumstances of this case \nwas improper; (2) EPA\u2019s reconsideration was based on a \nflawed interpretation of CAA section 209(b); (3) even under \nthat flawed interpretation, EPA misapplied the facts and \ninappropriately withdrew the waiver; (4) EPA erred in \nlooking beyond the statutory factors in CAA 209(b) to \naction taken by another agency under another statute to \njustify withdrawing the waiver; (5) that agency has also \nsince withdrawn the action EPA relied on in any event; \nand (6) EPA inappropriately provided an interpretive view \nof section 177.\n3.\u2002  84 FR 51310 (September 27, 2019). \n\n57a\nAs a result of this action, EPA\u2019s 2013 waiver for the \nACC program, specifically the waiver for California\u2019s GHG \nemission standards and ZEV sales mandate requirements \nfor model years (MYs) 2017 through 2025, comes back \ninto force.4 I am also rescinding the interpretive view set \nforth in SAFE 1 that States may not adopt California\u2019s \nGHG standards pursuant to CAA section 177 even if \nEPA has granted California a section 209 waiver for \nsuch standards. Accordingly, States may now adopt and \nenforce California\u2019s GHG standards so long as they meet \nthe requirements of Section 177, and EPA will evaluate \nany State\u2019s request to include those provisions in a SIP \nthrough a separate notice and comment process. \nSection II of this action contains a detailed history \nof EPA\u2019s waiver adjudications leading up to this action. \nIn summary, in 2012, CARB submitted the ACC waiver \nrequest to EPA, which included ample evidence of the \ncriteria pollution benefits of the GHG standards and the \nZEV sales mandate. As it had in all prior waiver decisions \nwith two exceptions (including SAFE 1), in considering the \nrequest EPA relied on its \u201ctraditional\u201d interpretation of \nsection 209(b)(1)(B), which examines whether California \n4.\u2002  In SAFE 1, EPA did not withdraw the entire 2013 waiver, but \ninstead only withdrew the waiver as it related to California\u2019s GHG \nemission standards and the ZEV sales mandate. The waiver for the \nlow-emission vehicle (LEV III) criteria pollutant standards in the \nACC program remained in place. EPA\u2019s reconsideration of SAFE \n1 and the impact on the ACC waiver therefore relates only to the \nGHG emission standards and the ZEV sales mandate, although \u201cACC \nprogram waiver\u201d is used in this document. This action rescinds the \nwaiver withdrawal in SAFE 1. In this decision, the Agency takes no \nposition on any impacts this decision may have on state law matters \nregarding implementation. \n\n58a\nneeds a separate motor vehicle program as a whole\u2014not \nspecific standards\u2014to address the state\u2019s compelling \nand extraordinary conditions. In 2013, EPA granted \nCalifornia\u2019s waiver request for its ACC program in full. \nIn 2018, however, EPA proposed to withdraw portions of \nits waiver granted in 2013 based on a new interpretation \nof section 209(b)(1)(B) that looked at whether the specific \nstandards (the GHG standards and ZEV sales mandate), as \nopposed to the program as a whole, continued to meet the \nsecond and third waiver prongs (found in sections 209(b)\n(1)(B) and (C)).5 In addition, EPA proposed to look beyond \nthe section 209(b) criteria to consider the promulgation of \na NHTSA regulation and pronouncements in SAFE 1 that \ndeclared state GHG emission standards and ZEV sales \nmandates preempted under EPCA. In 2019, after granting \nCARB a waiver for its ACC program in 2013 and after 12 \nstates had adopted all or part of the California standards \nunder section 177, EPA withdrew portions of the waiver \nfor CARB\u2019s GHG emission standards and ZEV sales \nmandates. In SAFE 1, EPA cited changed circumstances \nand was based on a new interpretation of the CAA and \nthe agency\u2019s reliance on an action by NHTSA that has \nnow been repealed.6 \n5.\u2002  EPA\u2019s 2018 proposal was jointly issued with the National \nHighway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). 83 FR 42986 \n(August 24, 2018) (the \u201cSAFE proposal\u201d). In addition to partially \nwithdrawing the waiver, that proposal proposed to set less stringent \ngreenhouse gas and CAFE standards for model years 2021-2026. \nNHTSA also proposed to make findings related to preemption under \nthe Energy Policy and Conservation Act (EPCA) and its relationship \nto state and local GHG emission standards and ZEV sales mandates. \n6.\u2002  84 FR 51310. In SAFE 1, NHTSA also finalized its action \nrelated to preemption under EPCA. NHTSA\u2019s action included both \n\n59a\nOn January 20, 2021, President Biden issued \nExecutive Order 13990, directing the Federal Agencies \nto \u201cimmediately review\u201d SAFE 1 and to consider action \n\u201csuspending, revising, or rescinding\u201d that action by \nApril 2021. On April 28, 2021, EPA announced its Notice \nof Reconsideration, including a public hearing and an \nopportunity for public comment.7 The Agency stated \nits belief that there were significant issues regarding \nwhether SAFE 1 was a valid and appropriate exercise \nof Agency authority, including the amount of time that \nhad passed since EPA\u2019s ACC program waiver decision, \nthe approach and legal interpretations used in SAFE 1, \nwhether EPA took proper account of the environmental \nconditions ( e.g., local climate and topography, number \nof motor vehicles, and local and regional air quality) in \nCalifornia, and the environmental consequences from \nthe waiver withdrawal in SAFE 1. Further, EPA stated \nit would be addressing issues raised in the related \npetitions for reconsideration of EPA\u2019s SAFE 1 action. \nIn the meantime, having reconsidered its own action, \nand also in response to Executive Order 13990, NHTSA \nrepealed its conclusion that state and local laws related \nregulatory text and well as pronouncements within the preamble \nof SAFE 1. In 2020, EPA finalized its amended and less stringent \ncarbon dioxide standards for the 2021-2026 model years in an action \ntitled \u201cThe Safer Affordable Fuel-Efficient (SAFE) Vehicles Rule for \nModel Years 2021-2026 Passenger Cars and Light Trucks\u201d (SAFE \n2). 85 FR 24174 (April 30, 2020). \n7.\u2002  \u201cCalifornia State Motor Vehicle Pollution Control Standards; \nAdvanced Clean Car Program; Reconsideration of a Previous \nWithdrawal of a Waiver of Preemption; Opportunity for Public \nHearing and Public Comment.\u201d 86 FR 22421 (April 28, 2021). \n\n60a\nto fuel economy standards, including GHG standards and \nZEV sales mandates, were preempted under EPCA,8 and \nEPA revised and made more stringent the Federal GHG \nemission standards for light-duty vehicles for 2023 and \nlater model years, under section 202(a).9 \nSection III of this action outlines the principles that \ngovern waiver reconsiderations. It sets forth the statutory \nbackground and context for the CAA preemption of \nnew motor vehicle emission standards, the criteria for \ngranting a waiver of preemption, and the ability of other \nStates to adopt and enforce California\u2019s new motor vehicle \nemission standards where a waiver has been issued if \ncertain CAA criteria are met. In brief, CAA section 209(a) \ngenerally preempts all States or political subdivisions \nfrom adopting and enforcing any standard relating to the \ncontrol of emissions from new motor vehicles or new motor \nvehicle engines. But section 209(b) contains an important \nexception that allows only California to submit a request \nto waive preemption for its standards. Importantly, \nEPA must grant the waiver unless the Administrator \nmakes at least one of three findings: (1) That California\u2019s \ndetermination that its standards will be, in the aggregate, \nat least as protective of public health and welfare as \napplicable Federal standards, is arbitrary and capricious \n(the \u201cfirst waiver prong,\u201d under section 209(b)(1)(A)); \n(2) that California does not need such State standards \nto meet compelling and extraordinary conditions (the \n\u201csecond waiver prong,\u201d under section 209(b)(1)(B)); or (3) \n8.\u2002  86 FR 74236 (December 29, 2021). \n9.\u2002  86 FR 74434 (December 30, 2021). \n\n61a\nthat California standards are not consistent with section \n202(a), which contains EPA\u2019s authority to regulate motor \nvehicles (the \u201cthird waiver prong,\u201d under section 209(b)(1)\n(C)). In the 1977 amendments to the CAA, section 177 was \nadded to allow other States that may be facing their own \nair quality concerns to adopt and enforce the California \nnew motor vehicle emission standards for which California \nhas been granted a waiver under section 209(b) if certain \ncriteria are met. \nSection III also provides more context to indicate that \nCongress intended that, when reviewing a request for a \nwaiver, EPA treat with deference the policy judgments on \nwhich California\u2019s vehicle emission standards are based. \nIt discusses the history of Congress allowing states to \nadopt more stringent standards. Ultimately, Congress \nbuilt a structure in section 209(b) that grants California \nauthority to address its air quality problems, and also \nacknowledges the needs of other states to address their \nair quality problems through section 177. Lastly, Section \nIII describes the burden and standard of proof for waiver \ndecisions.\nSection IV of this action then discusses EPA\u2019s first \nbasis for rescinding the SAFE 1 waiver withdrawal: That \nEPA did not appropriately exercise its limited authority \nto withdraw a waiver once granted. Section 209 does not \nprovide EPA with express authority to reconsider and \nwithdraw a waiver previously granted to California. EPA\u2019s \nauthority thus stems from its inherent reconsideration \nauthority. In the context of reconsidering a waiver grant, \nthat authority may only be exercised sparingly. EPA \n\n62a\nbelieves its inherent authority to reconsider a waiver \ndecision is constrained by the three waiver criteria that \nmust be considered before granting or denying a waiver \nrequest under section 209(b). EPA\u2019s reconsideration \nmay not be broader than the limits Congress placed on \nits ability to deny a waiver in the first place. EPA notes \nfurther support for limiting its exercise of reconsideration \nauthority, relevant in the context of a waiver withdrawal, \nis evidenced by Congress\u2019s creation of a state and federal \nregulatory framework to drive motor vehicle emissions \nreduction and technology innovation that depends for \nits success on the stable market signal of the waiver \ngrant\u2014automobile manufacturers must be able to depend \nreliably on the continuing validity of the waiver grant \nin order to justify the necessary investments in cleaner \nvehicle technology. Accordingly, EPA now believes it may \nonly reconsider a previously granted waiver to address a \nclerical or factual error or mistake, or where information \nshows that factual circumstances or conditions related to \nthe waiver criteria evaluated when the waiver was granted \nhave changed so significantly that the propriety of the \nwaiver grant is called into doubt. Even then, as with other \nadjudicatory actions, when choosing to undertake such a \nreconsideration EPA believes it should exercise its limited \nauthority within a reasonable timeframe and be mindful \nof reliance interests. EPA expects such occurrences will \nbe rare. The Agency\u2019s waiver withdrawal in SAFE 1 was \nnot an appropriate exercise of EPA\u2019s limited authority; \nthere was no clerical error or factual error in the ACC \nprogram waiver, and SAFE 1 did not point to any factual \ncircumstances or conditions related to the three waiver \nprongs that have changed so significantly that the \n\n63a\npropriety of the waiver grant is called into doubt. Rather, \nthe 2019 waiver withdrawal was based on a change in \nEPA\u2019s statutory interpretation, an incomplete assessment \nof the record, and another agency\u2019s action beyond the \nconfines of section 209(b). EPA erred in reconsidering a \npreviously granted waiver on these bases. Accordingly, \nEPA is rescinding its 2019 withdrawal of its 2013 ACC \nprogram waiver.\nSections V and VI further explain why, even if SAFE \n1 were an appropriate exercise of EPA\u2019s limited authority \nto reconsider its previously-granted waiver, the Agency \nwould still now rescind its waiver withdrawal.\nAs discussed in Section V, the Agency\u2019s reinterpretation \nof the second waiver prong in SAFE 1 was flawed. While \nEPA has traditionally interpreted the second waiver \nprong, section 209(b)(1)(B), to require a waiver unless \nthe Agency demonstrates that California does not \nneed its own motor vehicle emissions program, to meet \ncompelling and extraordinary conditions, the SAFE 1 \nwaiver withdrawal decision was based on a statutory \ninterpretation that calls for an examination of the need \nfor the specific standard at issue. Section V explains why \nEPA believes that its traditional interpretation is, at \nleast, the better interpretation of the second waiver prong \nbecause it is most consistent with the statutory language \nand supported by the legislative history. Accordingly, we \nreaffirm the traditional interpretation\u2014in which EPA \nreviews the need for California\u2019s motor vehicle program\u2014\nin this action.\n\n64a\nAdditionally, Section V explains why even if the \nfocus is on the specific standards, when looking at the \nrecord before it, EPA erred in SAFE 1 in concluding \nthat California does not have a compelling need for the \nspecific standards at issue\u2014the GHG emission standards \nand ZEV sales mandate. In particular, in SAFE 1, the \nAgency failed to take proper account of the nature and \nmagnitude of California\u2019s serious air quality problems, \nincluding the interrelationship between criteria and GHG \npollution.10 Section V further discusses EPA\u2019s improper \nsubstitution in SAFE 1 of its own policy preferences for \nCalifornia\u2019s, and discusses the importance of deferring to \nCalifornia\u2019s judgment on \u201cambiguous and controversial \nmatters of public policy\u201d that relate to the health and \nwelfare of its citizens.11 Based on a complete review of the \nrecord in this action, EPA now believes that, even under \nthe SAFE 1 interpretation, California needs the ZEV \nsales mandate and GHG standards at issue to address \ncompelling and extraordinary air quality conditions in \n10.\u2002  As explained herein, the requirements in the ACC program \nwere designed to work together in terms of the technologies that \nwould be used to both lower criteria emissions and GHG emissions. \nThe standards, including the ZEV sales mandate and the GHG \nemission standards, were designed to address the short- and long-\nterm air quality goals in California in terms of the criteria emission \nreductions (including upstream reductions) along GHG emission \nreductions. The air quality issues and pollutants addressed in the \nACC program are interconnected in terms of the impacts of climate \nchange on such local air quality concerns such as ozone exacerbation \nand climate effects on wildfires that affect local air quality. \n11.\u2002  40 FR 23102, 23104 (May 28, 1975); 58 FR 4166 (January \n13, 1993). \n\n65a\nthe state. EPA\u2019s findings in SAFE 1, which were based on \nthe Agency\u2019s inaccurate belief that these standards were \neither not intended to or did not result in criteria emission \nreductions to address California\u2019s National Ambient Air \nQuality Standard (NAAQS) obligations, are withdrawn. \nSection VI discusses SAFE 1\u2019s other basis for \nwithdrawing the ACC program waiver, EPCA. In SAFE \n1, EPA reached beyond the waiver criteria in section \n209(b)(1) and considered NHTSA\u2019s regulations in SAFE \n1 that state or local regulation of carbon dioxide emission \nfrom new motor vehicles (including California\u2019s ZEV sales \nmandate and GHG standards) are related to fuel economy \nand as such are preempted under EPCA. NHTSA has \nsince issued a final rule that repeals all regulatory text \nand additional pronouncements regarding preemption \nunder EPCA set forth in SAFE 1.12 This action by NHTSA \neffectively removes the underpinning and any possible \nreasoned basis for EPA\u2019s withdrawal decision based on \npreemption under EPCA in SAFE 1. Additionally, the \nAgency has historically refrained from consideration of \nfactors beyond the scope of the waiver criteria in section \n209(b)(1) and the 2013 ACC program waiver decision was \nundertaken consistent with this practice. EPA believes \nthat the consideration of EPCA preemption in SAFE 1 \nled the Agency to improperly withdraw the ACC program \nwaiver on this non-CAA basis. EPA\u2019s explanation that \nwithdrawal on this basis was justified because SAFE 1 \nwas a joint action, and its announcement that this would \nbe a single occurrence, does not justify the ACC waiver \n12\u2002  86 FR 74236. \n\n66a\nwithdrawal. Thus, EPA is rescinding the withdrawal of \nthose aspects of the ACC program waiver that were based \non NHTSA\u2019s actions in SAFE 1. \nSection VII addresses SAFE 1\u2019s interpretive view of \nsection 177 that States adopting California\u2019s new motor \nvehicle emission standards could not adopt California\u2019s \nGHG standards.13 EPA believes it was both unnecessary \nand inappropriate in a waiver proceeding to provide \nan interpretive view of the authority of states to adopt \nCalifornia standards when section 177 does not assign \nEPA any approval role in states\u2019 adoption of the standards. \nTherefore, as more fully explained in Section VII, the \nAgency is rescinding the interpretive view on section \n177 set out in SAFE 1. Section VIII discusses certain \nother considerations, including the equal sovereignty \ndoctrine and California\u2019s deemed-to-comply provision, \nand concludes that they do not disturb EPA\u2019s decision to \nrescind the 2019 waiver withdrawal action. \nSection IX contains the final decision to rescind \nthe withdrawal of the 2013 ACC program waiver. In \nsummary, I find that although EPA has inherent authority \nto reconsider its prior waiver decisions, that authority to \nreconsider is limited and may be exercised only when EPA \nhas made a clerical or factual error or mistake, or where \ninformation shows that factual circumstances or conditions \nrelated to the waiver criteria evaluated when the waiver \nwas granted have changed so significantly that the \npropriety of the waiver grant is called into doubt. Further, \n13.\u2002  84 FR at 51310, 51350. \n\n67a\nEPA\u2019s reconsideration may not be broader than the limits \nCongress placed on its ability to deny a waiver in the first \nplace. Even where those conditions are met, I believe that \nany waiver withdrawal decision should consider other \nfactors such as the length of time since the initial decision \nand California and others\u2019 reliance on the initial decision. \nBecause there were no factual or clerical errors or such \nsignificantly changed factual circumstances or conditions \nnecessary to trigger EPA\u2019s authority to reconsider its \npreviously granted waiver during the SAFE 1 proceeding, \nI believe SAFE 1 was not an appropriate exercise of \nEPA\u2019s authority to reconsider. In addition, even if it were \nan appropriate exercise, EPA should not have departed \nfrom its traditional interpretation of the second waiver \nprong (section 209(b)(1)(B)), which is properly focused on \nCalifornia\u2019s need for a separate motor vehicle emission \nprogram\u2014not specific standards\u2014to meet compelling and \nextraordinary conditions. And even under EPA\u2019s SAFE \n1 interpretation of the second waiver prong, a complete \nreview of the factual record demonstrates that California \ndoes need the GHG emission standards and ZEV sales \nmandate to meet compelling and extraordinary conditions \nin the State. Therefore, EPA should not have withdrawn \nthe ACC program waiver based upon the second waiver \nprong in SAFE 1 and recission of the withdrawal is \nwarranted. Additionally, I find that EPA inappropriately \nrelied on NHTSA\u2019s finding of preemption, now withdrawn, \nto support its waiver withdrawal, and rescind the waiver \nwithdrawal on that basis as well. Finally, independently \nin this action, I am rescinding the interpretive views of \nsection 177 that were set forth in SAFE 1, because it was \ninappropriate to include those views as part of this waiver \nproceeding.\n\n68a\nFor these reasons, I am rescinding EPA\u2019s part of \nSAFE 1 related to the CAA preemption of California\u2019s \nstandards. This recission has the effect of bringing the \nACC program waiver back into force.\nII.\t Background\nThis section provides background information needed \nto understand EPA\u2019s decision process in SAFE 1, and this \ndecision. This context includes: A summary of California\u2019s \nACC program including the record on the criteria pollutant \nbenefits of its ZEV sales mandate and GHG emission \nstandards; a review of the prior GHG emission standards \nwaivers in order to explain EPA\u2019s historical evaluation \nof the second waiver prong; an overview of the SAFE \n1 decision; a review of the petitions for reconsideration \nfiled subsequent to SAFE 1; and a description of the \nbases and scope of EPA\u2019s reconsideration of SAFE 1. \nEPA\u2019s sole purpose in soliciting public comment on its \nreconsideration was to determine whether SAFE 1 was a \nvalid and appropriate exercise of the Agency\u2019s authority. \nIn the Notice of Reconsideration, EPA therefore noted \nthat reconsideration was limited to SAFE 1 and that \nthe Agency was not reopening the ACC program waiver \ndecision.\nA.\t California\u2019s Advanced Clean Car (ACC) Program \nand EPA\u2019s 2013 Waiver\nOn June 27, 2012, CARB notified EPA of its adoption \nof the ACC program regulatory package that contained \namendments to its LEV III and ZEV sales mandate, and \nrequested a waiver of preemption under section 209(b) to \n\n69a\nenforce regulations pertaining to this program.14 The ACC \nprogram combined the control of smog- and soot-causing \npollutants and GHG emissions into a single coordinated \npackage of requirements for passenger cars, light-duty \ntrucks, and medium-duty passenger vehicles (as well as \nlimited requirements related to heavy-duty vehicles for \ncertain model years).15 \nIn its 2012 waiver request, CARB noted that the 2012 \nZEV amendments would also result in additional criteria \npollutant benefits in California in comparison to the \n14.\u2002  2012 Waiver Request, EPA-HQ-OAR-2012-0562-0004 (2012 \nWaiver Request) at 1, 3-6. CARB\u2019s LEV III standards include both \nits criteria emission standards and its GHG emission standards. \nSAFE 1 did not address the LEV III criteria emission standards \nand as such the ACC program waiver remained in place. SAFE \n1 did address CARB\u2019s GHG emission standards and ZEV sales \nmandate and this action addresses these two standards as well. \nAs noted in CARB\u2019s 2012 Waiver Request, these three standards \nare interrelated and comprehensive in order to address the State\u2019s \nserious air quality problems including its criteria pollutants and \nclimate change challenges. \n15.\u2002  As noted in CARB\u2019s waiver request, \u201c[a]t the December \n2009 hearing, the Board adopted Resolution 09-66, reaffirming \nits commitment to meeting California\u2019s long term air quality and \nclimate change reduction goals through commercialization of ZEV \ntechnologies. The Board further directed staff to consider shifting \nthe focus of the ZEV regulation to both GHG and criteria pollutant \nemission reductions, commercializing ZEVs and PHEVs in order to \nmeet the 2050 goals, and to take into consideration the new LEV fleet \nstandards and propose revisions to the ZEV regulation accordingly.\u201d \n2012 Waiver Request at 2 (emphasis added). EPA stated in SAFE \n1 that California\u2019s ZEV standard initially targeted only criteria \npollutants. 84 FR at 51329.

CARB further explained that because upstream \ncriteria and PM emissions are not captured in the LEV \nIII criteria pollutant standard, net upstream emissions \nare reduced through the increased use of electricity and \nconcomitant reductions in fuel production.17 \nOn August 31, 2012, EPA issued a notice of opportunity \nfor public hearing and written comment on CARB\u2019s \nrequest and solicited comment on all aspects of a full \nwaiver analysis for such request under the criteria \nof section 209(b).18 Commenters opposing the waiver \n16.\u2002  2012 Waiver Request at 6. \n17.\u2002  Id. at 15-16. \n18.\u2002  77 FR 53119 (August 31, 2012). \n\n71a\nasked EPA to deny the waiver under the second waiver \nprong, section 209(b)(1)(B), as it applied to the GHG \nprovisions in the ACC Program, calling on EPA to \nadopt an alternative interpretation of that provision \nfocusing on California\u2019s need for the specific standards. \nFollowing public notice and comment and based on its \ntraditional interpretation of section 209(b), on January \n9, 2013, EPA granted California\u2019s request for a waiver of \npreemption to enforce the ACC program regulations.19 \nThe traditional interpretation, which EPA stated is the \nbetter interpretation of section 209(b)(1)(B), calls for \nevaluating California\u2019s need for a separate motor vehicle \nemission program to meet compelling and extraordinary \nconditions.20 As explained, EPA must grant a waiver to \n19.\u2002  Set forth in the ACC program waiver decision is a summary \ndiscussion of EPA\u2019s earlier decision to depart from its traditional \ninterpretation of section 209(b)(1)(B) (the second waiver prong) in \nthe 2008 waiver denial for CARB\u2019s initial GHG standards for certain \nearlier model years along with EPA\u2019s return to the traditional \ninterpretation of the second prong in the waiver issued in 2009. 78 \nFR at 2125-31. These interpretations are discussed more fully in \nSection III. \n20.\u2002  Id. at 2128 (\u201cThe better interpretation of the text and \nlegislative history of this provision is that Congress did not intend \nthis criterion to limit California\u2019s discretion to a certain category \nof air pollution problems, to the exclusion of others. In this context \nit is important to note that air pollution problems, including local or \nregional air pollution problems, do not occur in isolation. Ozone and \nPM air pollution, traditionally seen as local or regional air pollution \nproblems, occur in a context that to some extent can involve long \nrange transport of this air pollution or its precursors. This long \nrange or global aspect of ozone and PM can have an impact on local \nor regional levels, as part of the background in which the local or \nregional air pollution problem occurs.\u201d). \n\n72a\nCalifornia unless the Administrator makes at least one of \nthe three statutorily-prescribed findings in section 209(b)\n(1). Concluding that opponents of the waiver did not meet \ntheir burden of proof to demonstrate that California does \nnot have such need, EPA found that it could not deny the \nwaiver under the second waiver prong.21 \nWithout adopting the alternative interpretation, \nEPA noted that, to the extent that it was appropriate to \nexamine the need for CARB\u2019s specific GHG standards \nto meet compelling and extraordinary conditions, EPA \nhad explained at length in its earlier 2009 GHG waiver \ndecision that California does have compelling and \nextraordinary conditions directly related to regulation \nof GHGs. This conclusion was supported by additional \nevidence submitted by CARB in the ACC program \nwaiver proceeding, including reports that demonstrate \nrecord-setting wildfires, deadly heat waves, destructive \nstorm surges, and loss of winter snowpack. Many of these \nextreme weather events and other conditions have the \npotential to dramatically affect human health and well-\n21.\u2002  Because EPA received comment on this issue during the \nACC program waiver proceeding, as it pertained to both CARB\u2019s \nGHG emission standards and ZEV sales mandate, the Agency \nrecounted the interpretive history associated with standards for \nboth GHG emissions and criteria air pollutants to explain EPA\u2019s \nbelief that section 209(b)(1)(B) should be interpreted the same \nway for all air pollutants. Id. at 2125-31 (\u201cAs discussed above, EPA \nbelieves that the better interpretation of the section 209(b)(1)(B) \ncriterion is the traditional approach of evaluating California\u2019s need \nfor a separate motor vehicle emission program to meet compelling \nand extraordinary conditions. Applying this approach with the \nreasoning noted above, with due deference to California, I cannot \ndeny the waiver.\u201d). \n\n73a\nbeing.22 Similarly, to the extent that it was appropriate to \nexamine the need for CARB\u2019s ZEV sales mandate, EPA \nnoted that the ZEV sales mandate in the ACC program \nenables California to meet both its air quality and climate \ngoals into the future. EPA recognized that CARB\u2019s \ncoordinated strategies reflected in the ACC program for \naddressing both criteria pollutants and GHGs and the \nmagnitude of the technology and energy transformation \nneeded to meet such goals.23 Therefore, EPA determined \nthat, to the extent the second waiver prong should be \ninterpreted to mean a need for the specific standards at \nissue, CARB\u2019s GHG emission standards and ZEV sales \nmandate satisfy such a finding. \nIn the context of assessing the need for the specific \nZEV sales mandate in the ACC program waiver, EPA \nnoted CARB\u2019s intent in the redesign of the ZEV regulation \n22.\u2002  Id. at 2126-29. Within the 2009 GHG waiver, and again in \nthe 2013 ACC program waiver, EPA explained that the traditional \napproach does not make section 209(b)(1)(B) a nullity, as EPA must \nstill determine whether California does not need its motor vehicle \nprogram to meet compelling and extraordinary conditions as \ndiscussed in the legislative history. Conditions in California may \none day improve such that it may no longer have a need for its motor \nvehicle program. \n23.\u2002  Id. at 2131 (\u201cWhether or not the ZEV standards achieve \nadditional reductions by themselves above and beyond the LEV III \nGHG and criteria pollutant standards, the LEV III program overall \ndoes achieve such reductions, and EPA defers to California\u2019s policy \nchoice of the appropriate technology path to pursue to achieve these \nemissions reductions. The ZEV standards are a reasonable pathway \nto reach the LEV III goals, in the context of California\u2019s longer-\nterm goals.\u201d). \n\n74a\nof addressing both criteria pollutants and GHG emissions, \nand CARB\u2019s demonstration of \u201cthe magnitude of the \ntechnology and energy transformation needed from the \ntransportation sector and associated energy production to \nmeet . . . the goals set forth by California\u2019s climate change \nrequirements\u201d and found that the ZEV standards would \nhelp California achieve those \u201clong term emission benefits \nas well as . . . some [short-term] reduction in criteria \npollutant emissions.\u201d24 \nB.\t Prior Waivers for GHG Standards\nFor over fifty years, EPA has evaluated California\u2019s \nrequests for waivers of preemption under section 209(b), \nprimarily considering CARB\u2019s motor vehicle emission \nprogram for criteria pollutants.25 More recently, the Agency \nhas worked to determine how section 209(b)(1)(B) should \nbe interpreted and applied to GHG standards, including \n24.\u2002  Id. at 2130-31.

Subsection (e) addresses the preemption \nof State or political subdivision regulation of emissions from nonroad \nengines or vehicles. Section 209(e)(2)(A) sets forth language similar \nto section 209(b) in terms of the criteria associated with EPA waiving \npreemption, in this instance for California nonroad vehicle and \nengine emission standards. Congress directed EPA to implement \nsubsection (e). See 40 CFR part 1074. EPA review of CARB requests \nsubmitted under section 209(e)(2)(A)(ii) includes consideration of \nwhether CARB needs its nonroad vehicle and engine program to \nmeet compelling and extraordinary conditions. See 78 FR 58090 \n(September 20, 2013). \n\n75a\nconsideration of the relationship of GHG standards to \nCalifornia\u2019s historical air quality problems, the public \nhealth impacts of GHG emissions on NAAQS pollutants, \nand the direct impacts of GHG emissions and climate \nchange on California and its inhabitants. While the SAFE \n1 withdrawal and revocation of the waiver for CARB\u2019s \nACC program represents a singular snapshot of this \ntask, it is important to examine EPA\u2019s long-standing and \nconsistent waiver practice in general, including EPA\u2019s \ninterpretations in prior waiver decisions pertaining to \nCARB\u2019s GHG emission standards, in order to determine \nwhether EPA properly applied the waiver criterion in \nsection 209(b)(1)(B) in SAFE 1.26 \nHistorically, EPA has consistently interpreted and \napplied the second waiver prong by considering whether \nCalifornia needed a separate motor vehicle emission \nprogram as compared to the specific standards at issue \nto meet compelling and extraordinary conditions.27 At the \nsame time, in response to commenters that have argued \nthat EPA is required to examine the specific standards \nat issue in the waiver request, EPA\u2019s practice has been to \nnevertheless review the specific standards to determine \nwhether California needs those individual standards to \nmeet compelling and extraordinary conditions.28 This \n26.\u2002  EPA notes that, in the history of EPA waiver decisions, \nit has only denied a waiver once (in 2008) and withdrawn a waiver \nonce (in 2019). Each instance was under this second waiver prong \nin section 209(b)(1)(B). \n27.\u2002  49 FR 18887, 18890 (May 3, 1984). \n28.\u2002   For example, in EPA\u2019s 2009 GHG waiver that reconsidered \nthe 2008 GHG waiver denial, the Agency noted that \u201cGiven the \n\n76a\ndoes not mean that EPA has adopted an \u201calternative \napproach\u201d and required a demonstration for the need for \nspecific standards; rather, this additional Agency review \nhas been afforded to address commenters\u2019 concerns and \nthis secondary analysis has been done to support the \nAgency\u2019s primary assessment. For example, EPA granted \nan authorization for CARB\u2019s In-use Off-road Diesel \nStandards (Fleet Requirements) that included an analysis \nunder both approaches.29 The only two departures from \nthis traditional approach occurred first in 2008 when EPA \ncomments submitted, however, EPA has also considered an \nalternative interpretation, which would evaluate whether the \nprogram or standards has a rational relationship to contributing \nto amelioration of the air pollution problems in California. Even \nunder this approach, EPA\u2019s inquiry would end there. California\u2019s \npolicy judgment that an incremental, directional improvement will \noccur and is worth pursuing is entitled, in EPA\u2019s judgment, to great \ndeference. EPA\u2019s consistent view is that it should give deference to \nCalifornia\u2019s policy judgments, as it has in past waiver decisions, \non California\u2019s choice of mechanism used to address air pollution \nproblems. EPA does not second-guess the wisdom or efficacy of \nCalifornia\u2019s standards. EPA has also considered this approach \nwith respect to the specific GHG standards themselves, as well as \nCalifornia\u2019s motor vehicle emissions program.\u201d 74 FR at 32766 (citing \nto Motor & Equip.

On \nMarch 6, 2008, EPA denied the waiver request based \non a new interpretive finding that section 209(b) was \nintended for California to enforce new motor vehicle \nemission standards that address local or regional air \npollution problems, and an Agency belief that California \ncould not demonstrate a \u201cneed\u201d under section 209(b)\n(1)(B) for standards intended to address global climate \nchange problems. EPA also employed this new alternative \ninterpretation to state a belief that the effects of climate \nchange in California are not compelling and extraordinary \nin comparison with the rest of the country. Therefore, in \nthe 2008 waiver denial, EPA did not evaluate whether \nCalifornia had a need for its motor vehicle emission \nprogram to meet compelling and extraordinary conditions \n(the traditional interpretation) but rather focused on \nthe specific GHG emission standard in isolation and not \nin conjunction with the other motor vehicle emission \nstandards for criteria pollutants.\nIn 2009, EPA initiated a reconsideration of the \n2008 waiver denial. The reconsideration resulted in \ngranting CARB a waiver for its GHG emission standards \n\n78a\ncommencing in the 2009 model year.30 In granting \nthe waiver, EPA rejected the Agency\u2019s alternative \ninterpretation of the second waiver prong announced \nin the 2008 waiver denial. Instead, EPA returned to \nits traditional approach of evaluating California\u2019s need \nfor a separate motor vehicle emission program to meet \ncompelling and extraordinary conditions because the \nAgency viewed it as the better interpretation of the \nsecond waiver prong. Under the traditional interpretation, \nEPA found that the opponents of the waiver had not met \ntheir burden of proof to demonstrate that California did \nnot need its motor vehicle emission program to meet \ncompelling and extraordinary conditions. In responding \nto comments on this issue, EPA also determined that, \neven if the alternative interpretation were to be applied, \nthe opponents of the waiver had not demonstrated that \nCalifornia did not need its GHG emissions standards to \nmeet compelling and extraordinary conditions.31 \nSince EPA\u2019s 2009 GHG waiver decision and before \nSAFE 1 the Agency applied the traditional interpretation \nof the second waiver prong in its GHG-related waiver \n30.\u2002  74 FR 32743, 32745 (July 8, 2009). \n31.\u2002  74 FR at 32759-67. For example, EPA noted that the \nanalysis of the need for CARB\u2019s GHG standards in the 2008 waiver \ndenial failed to consider that although the factors that cause ozone \nare primarily local in nature and that ozone is a local or regional \nair pollution problem, the impacts of global climate change can \nnevertheless exacerbate this local air pollution problem.

EPA received comment \nduring the reconsideration of SAFE 1 that questioned whether \nCARB needed its GHG standards if it was otherwise accepting \ncompliance with the Federal GHG standards. EPA addressed the \nissue in its final decision (76 FR at 34696-98) and continues to believe \nEPA\u2019s analysis applies. The existence of federal emission standards \nthat CARB may choose to harmonize with or deem as compliance \nwith its own State standards (or that CARB may choose to set \nmore stringent standards) does not on its own render California\u2019s \nas not needed. CARB continues to administer an integrated and \ncomprehensive motor vehicle emission program (including its ZEV \nsales mandate and GHG emission standards and other applicable \nemission standards for light-duty vehicles) and this program \ncontinues to evolve to address California\u2019s serious air quality issues. \nCARB\u2019s decision to select some federal emission standards as \n\n80a\nin the June 14, 2011 within-the-scope decision EPA \ndetermined that CARB\u2019s 2009 amendments did not affect \nor undermine the Agency\u2019s prior determination made in \nthe 2009 GHG waiver decision, including the technological \nfeasibility findings in section 209(b)(1)(C).34 EPA also \nacted on two requests for waivers of preemption for \nCARB\u2019s heavy-duty (HD) tractor-trailer GHG emission \nstandards.35 Once again, EPA relied upon its traditional \napproach of evaluating California\u2019s need for a separate \nmotor vehicle emission program to meet compelling and \nextraordinary conditions and found that no evidence \nhad been submitted to demonstrate that California no \nsufficient to comply with its own State emission standards does not \nnegate the overall design and purpose of section 209 of the CAA. \nIn the within-the-scope decision issued in 2011, EPA agreed with \nGlobal Automakers comment that the deemed-to-comply provision \nrenders emission benefits equally protective as between California \nand Federal programs.

EPA posited that since the grant of the initial \nwaiver a reassessment of California\u2019s need for its GHG \nstandards and ZEV sales mandate under the second \nwaiver prong, section 209(b)(1)(B), was appropriate. EPA \nfurther posited that its own Federal GHG rulemaking in \nthe SAFE proposal raised questions about the feasibility \nof CARB\u2019s standards under the third waiver prong, section \n209(b)(1)(C).39 In addition, EPA reasoned that the SAFE \nproposal presented a unique situation that required \nEPA to consider the implications of NHTSA\u2019s proposed \nconclusion that California\u2019s GHG emission standards and \nZEV sales mandate were preempted by EPCA.40 EPA \n38.\u2002  The Safer Affordable Fuel-Efficient (SAFE) Vehicles Rule \nfor Model Years 2021-2026 Passenger Cars and Light Trucks, 83 \nFR at 42986. \n39.\u2002  As explained below, EPA did not make a determination \nregarding section 209(b)(1)(C) in SAFE 1. \n40.\u2002  \u201cTo the extent that NHTSA has determined that these \nstandards are void ab initio because EPCA preempts standards that \nrelate to fuel economy, that determination presents an independent \nbasis for EPA to consider the validity of the initial grant of a waiver \n\n83a\nthus also posited that state standards preempted under \nEPCA cannot be afforded a valid section 209(b) waiver \nand then proposed that it would be necessary to withdraw \nthe waiver separate and apart from section 209(b)(1)(B) \nand (C) if NHTSA finalized its interpretation regarding \npreemption under EPCA. \nDuring the SAFE 1 proceeding, EPA received \nadditional information demonstrating that the ZEV \nsales mandate plays a role in reducing criteria pollution, \nincluding CARB\u2019s comments that EPA\u2019s prior findings \nin the ACC program waiver were correct. As noted by \na number of States and Cities, \u201c[f]or example, CARB \nmodeled the consequences of the actions proposed in \nSAFE, which included withdrawing California\u2019s waiver \nfor its GHG and ZEV standards and freezing the federal \nGHG standards at MY 2020 levels.

In the same action, EPA withdrew the \nwaiver of preemption for California to enforce the ACC \nprogram GHG and ZEV sales mandate on two grounds.45 \nFirst, in SAFE 1 the Agency posited that standards \npreempted under EPCA could not be afforded a valid \nwaiver of preemption under section 209(b). EPA explained \nthat Agency pronouncements in the ACC program waiver \ndecision on the historical practice of disregarding the \npreemptive effect of EPCA in the context of evaluating \nCalifornia\u2019s waiver applications were \u201cinappropriately \nbroad, to the extent it suggested that EPA is categorically \nbenefits of California\u2019s GHG and ZEV standards.

Circuit granted \nthe Agencies\u2019 motion to hold the case in abeyance in light of the \nreconsideration of the SAFE 1 action). EPA also received three \npetitions for reconsideration of this waiver withdrawal. \n\n86a\nforbidden from ever determining that a waiver is \ninappropriate due to consideration of anything other than \nthe \u2018criteria\u2019 or \u2018prongs\u2019 at section 209(b)(1)(B)(A)-(C).\u201d46 \nEPA further explained that those pronouncements were \nmade in waiver proceedings where the Agency was acting \nsolely on its own in contrast to a joint action with NHTSA \nsuch as SAFE 1. Additionally, EPA expressed its intention \nnot to consider factors other than statutory criteria set out \nin section 209(b)(1)(A)-(C) in future waiver proceedings, \nexplaining that addressing the preemptive effect of EPCA \nand its implications for EPA\u2019s waiver for California\u2019s GHG \nstandards and ZEV sales mandate was uniquely called for \nin SAFE 1 because EPA and NHTSA were coordinating \nregulatory actions in a single notice.47 \nSecond, EPA withdrew the waiver for the GHG \nstandards and ZEV sales mandate under the second waiver \nprong, section 209(b)(1)(B), on two alternative grounds. \nSpecifically, EPA determined first that California does \nnot need the GHG standards \u201cto meet compelling and \nextraordinary conditions,\u201d under section 209(b)(1)(B), \nand second, even if California does have compelling and \nextraordinary conditions in the context of global climate \nchange, California does not \u201cneed\u201d the specific GHG \nstandards under section 209(b)(1)(B) because they will not \nmeaningfully address global air pollution problems of the \ntype associated with GHG emissions.48 EPA also reasoned \n46.\u2002  84 FR at 51338. \n47.\u2002  Id. \n48.\u2002  Id. at 51341-42. \n\n87a\nthat because CARB had characterized the ZEV sales \nmandate as a compliance mechanism for GHG standards, \nboth were \u201cclosely interrelated\u201d given the overlapping \ncompliance regimes for the ACC program, and as a result \nthe ZEV sales mandate was inextricably interconnected \nwith CARB\u2019s GHG standards.49 In support of its overall \ndetermination that the ZEV sales mandate was not needed \nto meet compelling and extraordinary conditions, EPA \nrelied on a single statement in the ACC program waiver \nsupport document where CARB did not attribute criteria \nemission reductions to the ZEV sales mandate, but rather \nnoted its LEV III criteria pollutant fleet standard was \nresponsible for those emission reductions.50 Relying on \nthis reasoning, EPA also withdrew the waiver for the ZEV \nsales mandate under the second waiver prong finding that \nCalifornia had no \u201cneed\u201d for its own ZEV sales mandate. \nIn withdrawing the waiver, EPA relied on an \nalternative view of the scope of the Agency\u2019s analysis of \nCalifornia waiver requests and posited that reading \u201csuch \nState standards\u201d as requiring EPA to only and always \nconsider California\u2019s entire motor vehicle program would \nlimit the application of this waiver prong in a way that \nEPA did not believe Congress intended.51 EPA further \n49.\u2002  Id. at 51337. \n50.\u2002  Id. at 51330. \n51.\u2002  In other words, EPA asserted that once it determines that \nCalifornia needed its very first set of submitted standards to meet \nextraordinary and compelling conditions, EPA would never have the \ndiscretion to determine that California did not need any subsequent \nstandards for which it sought a successive waiver. EPA based its \n\n88a\nnoted that the Supreme Court had found that CAA \nprovisions may apply differently to GHGs than they do to \ntraditional pollutants in UARG v. EPA, 134 S. Ct. 2427 \n(2014) (partially reversing the GHG \u201cTailoring\u201d Rule on \ngrounds that the CAA section 202(a) endangerment finding \nfor GHG emissions from motor vehicles did not compel \nregulation of all sources of GHG emissions under the \nPrevention of Significant Deterioration and Title V permit \nprograms). EPA then interpreted section 209(b)(1)(B) \nas requiring a particularized, local nexus between (1) \npollutant emissions from sources, (2) air pollution, and \n(3) resulting impact on health and welfare.52 Interpreting \nsection 209(b)(1)(C) to be limited to the specific standards \nunder the waiver, EPA stated that \u201csuch State standards\u201d \nin sections 209(b)(1)(B) and (C) should be read consistently \nwith each other, which EPA asserted was a departure \nfrom the traditional approach where this phrase in section \n209(b)(1)(B) is read as referring back to \u201cin the aggregate\u201d \nin section 209(b)(1).53 \nreading also on an assertion of ambiguity in the meaning of \u201csuch \nState standards\u201d in section 209(b)(1)(B). \n52.\u2002  Id. at 51339-40. \n53.\u2002  Id. at 51344-45.EPA notes that this SAFE 1 position was \ntaken despite the Agency previously stating in the ACC program \nwaiver that \u201cSimilarly, although the Dealers might suggest that \nEPA only be obligated to determine whether each of CARB\u2019s ACC \nregulatory components, in isolation, is consistent with section 202(a) \nwe believe the better approach is to determine the technological \nfeasibility of each standard in the context of the entire regulatory \nprogram for the particular industry category. In this case, we \nbelieve CARB has in fact recognized the interrelated, integrated \napproach the industry must take in order to address the regulatory \n\n89a\nIn the SAFE proposal, as an additional basis for \nthe waiver withdrawal, EPA proposed to find that \nCARB\u2019s ZEV sales mandate and GHG standards are not \nconsistent with section 202(a) of the CAA under the third \nwaiver prong, section 209(b)(1)(C).54 However, in the final \nSAFE 1 action, EPA and NHTSA explained they were \nnot finalizing the proposed assessment regarding the \ntechnological feasibility of the Federal GHG and CAFE \nstandards for MY 2021 through 2025 in SAFE 1, and thus \nEPA did not finalize any determination with respect to \nsection 209(b)(1)(C).55 \nIn justifying the withdrawal action in SAFE 1, \nEPA opined that the text, structure, and context of \nsection 209(b) supported EPA\u2019s authority to reconsider \nprior waiver grants. Specifically, EPA asserted that \nthe Agency\u2019s authority to reconsider the grant of ACC \ncomponents of the ACC program. As noted above, the House \nCommittee Report explained as part of the 1977 amendments to the \nClean Air Act that California was to be afforded flexibility to adopt \na complete program of motor vehicle emission controls (emphasis \nadded). As such, EPA believes that Congress intended EPA to afford \nCalifornia the broadest possible discretion in selecting the best \nmeans to protect the health of its citizens and the public welfare.32 \nEPA believes this intent extends to CARB\u2019s flexibility in designing \nits motor vehicle emission program and evaluating the aggregate \neffect of regulations within the program.\u201d 78 FR at 2217. \n54.\u2002  83 FR at 43240. \n55.\u2002  84 FR at 51350.

EPA\u2019s subsequent regulation to issue Federal \nstandards did not address this issue. 85 FR 24174. \n\n90a\nprogram waiver was implicit in section 209(b) given that \nrevocation of a waiver is implied in the authority to grant \na waiver. The Agency noted that further support for the \nauthority to reconsider could be found in a single sentence \nin the 1967 legislative history of provisions now codified \nin sections 209(a) and (b) and the judicial principle that \nagencies possess inherent authority to reconsider their \ndecisions. According to the Senate report from the 1967 \nCAA amendments, the Administrator has \u201cthe right . . . \nto withdraw the waiver at any time [if] after notice and \nan opportunity for public hearing he finds that the State \nof California no longer complies with the conditions of \nthe waiver.\u201d56 EPA also noted that, subject to certain \nlimitations, administrative agencies possess inherent \nauthority to reconsider their decisions in response to \nchanged circumstances: \u201cIt is well settled that EPA has \ninherent authority to reconsider, revise, or repeal past \ndecisions to the extent permitted by law so long as the \nAgency provides a reasoned explanation.\u201d57 This authority \nexists in part because EPA\u2019s interpretations of the statutes \nit administers \u201care not carved in stone.\u201d58 \nFinally, in SAFE 1, EPA provided an interpretive \nview of section 177 as not authorizing other states to adopt \nCalifornia\u2019s GHG standards for which EPA had granted \na waiver of preemption under section 209(b).

EPA stated that nonattainment designations \nexist only as to criteria pollutants and GHGs are not \ncriteria pollutants; therefore, states could not adopt \nGHG standards under section 177. Notably, California in \nprevious waiver requests addressed the criteria pollutant \nbenefits of GHG emissions reductions, specifically related \nto ground level ozone.\nD.\t Petitions for Reconsideration\nAfter issuing SAFE 1, EPA received three petitions \nfor reconsideration urging the Agency to reconsider the \nwaiver withdrawal of the ACC program\u2019s GHG standards \nand ZEV sales mandate and to rescind part or all of the \nSAFE 1 action.59 The first Petition for Clarification/\nReconsideration was submitted by the State of California \nand a number of States and Cities on October 9, 2019 \n(California Petition for Clarification).60 These Petitioners \nsought both clarification and reconsideration of the scope \nof SAFE 1. Citing somewhat contradictory statements in \nthe action, they claimed that SAFE 1 created confusion \nregarding which model years of the ACC program were \n59.\u2002  The California Petition for Clarification only sought \nreconsideration of SAFE 1 to the extent it withdrew the ACC \nprogram waiver for model years outside those proposed.

In some places, EPA\u2019s statements indicate that it has \nlimited its action(s) to the model years for which it proposed to \nwithdraw and for which it now claims to have authority to withdraw\u2014\nnamely model years 2021 through 2025. In other places, however, \nEPA\u2019s statements suggest action(s) with a broader scope\u2014one \nthat would include earlier model years.\u201d Id. at 2. In SAFE 1, EPA \nwithdrew the waiver for California\u2019s GHG and ZEV standards for \nmodel years 2017-2025 on the basis of EPCA preemption and for \nmodel years 2021-2025 on the basis of the second waiver prong. \n62.\u2002  EPA-HQ-OAR-2021-0257-0014.

The late \ncomments summarized in the Petition address SAFE 1\u2019s \nEPCA preemption and second waiver prong arguments. \nOn EPCA preemption, the summarized comments \nasserted that EPCA does not preempt GHG standards \nbecause GHG emission standards are not the \u201cfunctional \nequivalent\u201d of fuel economy standards, as SAFE 1 \nclaimed. On the second waiver prong, the summarized \ncomments asserted both that GHG and ZEV standards \ndo have criteria pollutant benefits, and that the threat of \nclimate change is compelling and extraordinary and will \nhave California-specific impacts. In addition to objections \nto SAFE 1\u2019s EPCA preemption and second waiver prong \narguments, the summarized comments asserted that ZEV \nstandards play a key role in SIPs, which were disrupted \nby SAFE 1. This disruption, Petitioners claimed, violated \n\u201cconformity\u201d rules prohibiting federal actions from \nundermining state\u2019s air quality plans.63 \nA third Petition for Reconsideration was submitted by \nseveral states and cities on November 26, 2019 (States and \nCities\u2019 Petition).64 These Petitioners sought reconsideration \n63.\u2002  These \u201clate comments\u201d can be found in the \u201cAppendix \nof Exhibits\u201d attached to the Petition for Reconsideration.

This Petition was \njoined by the States of California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, \nHawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, \nNew Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Rhode Island, \nVermont, Washington, Wisconsin, Michigan, the Commonwealths of \nMassachusetts, Pennsylvania, and Virginia, the District of Columbia, \n\n94a\nof the withdrawal on the grounds that EPA failed to \nprovide an opportunity to comment on various rationales \nand determinations, in particular on its authority to \nrevoke argument, flawed re-interpretation and application \nof the second waiver prong, its flawed new rationale for \nconsidering factors outside section 209(b) (namely, EPCA \npreemption), and its determination that states cannot \nadopt California\u2019s GHG standards under section 177. For \nexample, these Petitioners claimed they did not have an \nadequate opportunity to comment on EPA\u2019s use of equal \nsovereignty or the endangerment finding as rationales for \nits new \u201cparticularized nexus\u201d interpretation of the second \nwaiver prong. These Petitioners also claimed that EPA\u2019s \nstatements concerning the burden of proof applicable to \na waiver revocation were either unclear or inaccurate, \nparticularly whether the Agency bears the burden of proof \nin withdrawing a previously granted waiver and, if not, \nhow and why this burden of proof is different from the \nburden of proof for denying a waiver request.65 Finally, \nthese Petitioners asserted that the Agency failed to \nconsider comments, submitted after the formal comment \nperiod, that challenged EPA\u2019s interpretation of the second \nwaiver prong, including new evidence of California\u2019s need \nfor its GHG emission standards and ZEV sales mandate, \nand alleged that EPA\u2019s rationale was pretextual and \nbased on the Administration\u2019s political animosity towards \nCalifornia and on the oil industry\u2019s influence. \nand the Cities of Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco, and San \nJose. \n65.\u2002  The applicable burden of proof for a waiver withdrawal is \ndiscussed in Section III of this decision. \n\n95a\nEPA notified the petitioners in the above-noted \nPetitions for Reconsideration that the Agency would \nbe considering issues raised in their petitions as part \nof the proceeding to reconsider SAFE 1. This action \naddresses these petitions in the broader context of EPA\u2019s \nadjudicatory reconsideration of SAFE 1 commenced in \nresponse to a number of significant issues with SAFE 1.\nIII.\tPrinciples Governing This Review\nThe CAA has been a paradigmatic example of \ncooperative federalism, under which \u201cStates and the \nFederal Government [are] partners in the struggle against \nair pollution.\u201d66 In Title II, Congress authorized EPA to \npromulgate emission standards for mobile sources and \ngenerally preempted states from adopting their own \nstandards.67 At the same time, Congress created an \nimportant exception for the State of California. \n66.\u2002  General Motors Corp. v. United States, 496 U.S. 530, 532 \n(1990). \n67.\u2002  \u201cThe regulatory difference [between Titles I and II] is \nexplained in part by the difficulty of subjecting motor vehicles, \nwhich readily move across state boundaries, to control by individual \nstates.\u201d Engine Mfrs. Ass\u2019n v. EPA, 88 F.3d 1075, 1079 (D.C. Cir. \n1996). Congress also asserted federal control in this area to avoid \n\u201cthe specter of an anarchic patchwork of federal and state regulatory \nprograms\u201d nationwide. See Motor & Equip. Mfrs. Ass\u2019n, Inc. v. EPA, \n627 F.2d 1095, 1109 (D.C. Cir. 1979) ( MEMA I ). \n\n96a\nA.\t Scope of Preemption and Waiver Criteria Under \nthe Clean Air Act\nThe legal framework for this decision stems from the \nwaiver provision first adopted by Congress in 1967, and \nsubsequent amendments. In Title II of the CAA, Congress \nestablished only two programs for control of emissions \nfrom new motor vehicles\u2014EPA emission standards \nadopted under the CAA and California emission standards \nadopted under its state law. Congress accomplished this \nby preempting all state and local governments from \nadopting or enforcing emission standards for new motor \nvehicles, while at the same time providing that California \ncould receive a waiver of preemption for its emission \nstandards and enforcement procedures in keeping with \nits prior experience regulating motor vehicles and its \nserious air quality problems. Accordingly, section 209(a) \npreempts states or political subdivisions from adopting \nor attempting to enforce any standard relating to the \ncontrol of emissions from new motor vehicles.68 Under the \nterms of section 209(b)(1), after notice and opportunity \nfor public hearing, EPA must waive the application of \nsection 209(a) to California unless the Administrator finds \n68.\u2002  42 U.S.C. 7543(a)-(a) Prohibition No State or any political \nsubdivision thereof shall adopt or attempt to enforce any standard \nrelating to the control of emissions from new motor vehicles or new \nmotor vehicle engines subject to this part. No State shall require \ncertification, inspection, or any other approval relating to the control \nof emissions from any new motor vehicle or new motor vehicle \nengine as condition precedent to the initial retail sale, titling (if \nany), or registration of such motor vehicle, motor vehicle engine, or \nequipment. \n\n97a\nat least one of three criteria to deny a waiver in section \n209(b)(1)(A)-(C) has been met.69 EPA may thus deny a \nwaiver only if it makes at least one of these three findings \nbased on evidence in the record, including arguments that \nopponents of the waiver have provided. This framework \nstruck an important balance that protected manufacturers \nfrom multiple and different state emission standards and \npreserved a pivotal role for California in the control of \nemissions from new motor vehicles. Congress intentionally \nstructured this waiver provision to restrict and limit \nEPA\u2019s ability to deny a waiver and did this to ensure that \nCalifornia had broad discretion in selecting the means \nit determined best to protect the health and welfare of \n69.\u2002  42 U.S.C. 7543(b)(1): \n(1) The Administrator shall, after notice and \nopportunity for public hearing, waive application of \nthis section to any State which has adopted standards \n(other than crankcase emission standards) for the \ncontrol of emissions from new motor vehicles or new \nmotor vehicle engines prior to March 30, 1966, if the \nState determines that the State standards will be, in \nthe aggregate, at least as protective of public health \nand welfare as applicable Federal standards. No such \nwaiver shall be granted if the Administrator finds \nthat\u2014\n(A) the determination of the State is arbitrary and \ncapricious,\n(B) such State does not need such State standards \nto meet compelling and extraordinary conditions, or\n(C) such State standards and accompanying \nenforcement procedures are not consistent with \nsection 7521(a) of this title.\n\n98a\nits citizens in recognition of both the harsh reality of \nCalifornia\u2019s air pollution and to allow California to serve \nas a pioneer and a laboratory for the nation in setting \nnew motor vehicle emission standards and developing \ncontrol technology.70 Accordingly, section 209(b) specifies \nthat EPA must grant California a waiver if California \ndetermines that its standards are, in the aggregate, at \nleast as protective of the public health and welfare as \napplicable Federal standards. \nEPA has consistently interpreted the waiver provision \nas placing the burden on the opponents of a waiver and \nEPA to demonstrate that one of the criteria for a denial \nhas been met. In this context, since 1970, EPA has \nrecognized its limited discretion in reviewing California \nwaiver requests. For over fifty years, therefore, EPA\u2019s role \nupon receiving a request for waiver of preemption from \nCalifornia has been limited and remains only to determine \nwhether it is appropriate to make any of the three findings \nspecified by the CAA. If the Agency cannot make at \nleast one of the three findings, then the waiver must be \ngranted. The three waiver criteria are also properly \nseen as criteria for a denial. This reversal of the normal \nstatutory structure embodies and is consistent with the \ncongressional intent of providing deference to California \nto maintain its own new motor vehicle emission program.\n70.\u2002  See, e.g., S. Rep. No. 403, 90th Cong., 1st Sess. 33 (1967) \n(The waiver of preemption is for California\u2019s \u201cunique problems and \npioneering efforts.\u201d); 113 Cong.

Congress also \nestablished the NAAQS program, under which EPA \nissues air quality criteria and sets standards for so-called \n\u201ccriteria\u201d pollutants, and states with regions that have \nnot \u201cattained\u201d those federal standards must submit SIPs \nindicating how they plan to attain the NAAQS (which \nis often a multi-year, comprehensive plan). With the \nCAA Amendments of 1977, Congress allowed California \nto consider the protectiveness of its standards \u201cin the \naggregate,\u201d rather than requiring that each standard \nproposed by the State be as or more stringent than its \nfederal counterpart.71 Congress also approved EPA\u2019s \ninterpretation of the waiver provision as providing \nappropriate deference to California\u2019s policy goals and \nconsistent with Congress\u2019s intent \u201cto permit California to \nproceed with its own regulatory program\u201d for new motor \nvehicle emissions.72 \nIn previous waiver decisions, EPA has noted that \nthe statute specifies particular and limited grounds for \nrejecting a waiver and has therefore limited its review \nto those grounds. EPA has also noted that the structure \nCongress established for reviewing California\u2019s decision-\nmaking is deliberately narrow, which further supports \nthis approach. This has led EPA to reject arguments that \n71.\u2002  42 U.S.C. 7543(b)(1). \n72.\u2002  H.R. Rep.

Thus, my consideration of all \nthe evidence submitted concerning a waiver \ndecision is circumscribed by its relevance to \nthose questions that I may consider under \nsection 209(b).73 \nGiven the text, legislative history, and judicial \nprecedent, EPA has consistently interpreted section \n209(b) as requiring it to grant a waiver unless opponents \nof a waiver can demonstrate that one of the criteria for a \ndenial has been met.74 \n73.\u2002  78 FR at 2115 (footnote omitted). \n74.\u2002  MEMA I, 627 F.2d at 1120-21 (\u201cThe language of the statute \nand its legislative history indicate that California\u2019s regulations, and \nCalifornia\u2019s determination that they comply with the statute, when \n\n101a\nThe 1977 CAA Amendments additionally demonstrated \nthe significance of California\u2019s standards to the Nation as \na whole with Congress\u2019 adoption of a new section 177. \nSection 177 permits other states addressing their own \nair pollution problems to adopt and enforce California \nnew motor vehicle standards \u201cfor which a waiver has been \ngranted if certain criteria are met.\u201d75 Also known as the \npresented to the Administrator are presumed to satisfy the waiver \nrequirements and that the burden of proving otherwise is on whoever \nattacks them.\u201d); Motor & Equip.

In waiver decisions, EPA has thus recognized \nthat congressional intent in creating a limited review of \nCalifornia waiver requests based on the section 209(b)(1) \ncriteria was to ensure that the federal government did \nnot second-guess the wisdom of state policy. In an early \nwaiver decision EPA highlighted this deference:\nIt is worth noting * * * I would feel \nconstrained to approve a California approach \nto the problem which I might also feel unable \nto adopt at the federal level in my own capacity \nas a regulator. The whole approach of the Clean \nAir Act is to force the development of new types \nof emission control technology where that is \nneeded by compelling the industry to \u201ccatch \nup\u201d to some degree with newly promulgated \nstandards. Such an approach * * * may be \nattended with costs, in the shape of reduced \nproduct offering, or price or fuel economy \npenalties, and by risks that a wider number of \nvehicle classes may not be able to complete their \ndevelopment work in time. Since a balancing \nof these risks and costs against the potential \nbenefits from reduced emissions is a central \npolicy decision for any regulatory agency under \n\n105a\nthe statutory scheme outlined above, I believe I \nam required to give very substantial deference \nto California\u2019s judgments on this score.78 \nAs noted above, Congress amended the CAA in 1977. \nWithin these amendments, Congress had the opportunity \nto reexamine the waiver provision and elected to expand \nCalifornia\u2019s flexibility to adopt a complete program of \nmotor vehicle emission controls. The House Committee \nReport explained that \u201c[t]he amendment is intended to \nratify and strengthen the California waiver provision \nand to affirm the underlying intent of that provision, \ni.e., to afford California the broadest possible discretion \nin selecting the best means to protect the health of its \ncitizens and the public welfare.\u201d79 \nSAFE 1 was a departure from congressional intent \nand EPA\u2019s typical practice of deference to California \non matters of state public policy regarding how best to \naddress its serious air quality problems. In SAFE 1, \nEPA adopted a new interpretation of section 209(b)(1)(B) \nmore than five years after the initial grant of the ACC \nprogram waiver and applied it to CARB\u2019s GHG standards \nand ZEV sales mandate.

Congress amended section 209(b)\n(1)(A) regarding California\u2019s determination that its standards are \nas at least as protective as applicable Federal standards so that \nsuch determination may be done \u201cin the aggregate\u201d looking at the \nsummation of the standards within the vehicle program. \n\n106a\nspecific standards, instead of the \u201cneed\u201d for a separate \nmotor vehicle emission program to meet compelling \nand extraordinary conditions, stating that \u201csuch State \nstandards\u201d in section 209(b)(1)(B) was ambiguous with \nrespect to the scope of the Agency\u2019s analysis. EPA further \ndetermined that California did not need the ZEV sales \nmandate to meet compelling and extraordinary conditions \nby relying on a single statement in the ACC program \nwaiver support document taken out of context, where \nit noted that the ZEV sales mandate had no criteria \nemissions benefits in terms of vehicle emissions and its \nLEV III criteria pollutant fleet standard was responsible \nfor those emission reductions. In response to the SAFE \n1 proposal, California had provided further context and \nadditional data on net upstream emissions benefits of the \nZEV sales mandate, but EPA did not consider them in \narriving at the findings and conclusions in SAFE 1. The \nfinal decision in SAFE 1 was not based on the third waiver \nprong.80 EPA also explained in SAFE 1 that the task of \ninterpreting section 209(b)(1)(B) required no deference \nto California.81 \nC.\t Standard and Burden of Proof\nIn Motor and Equipment Manufacturers\u2019 Association \nv.

We need not decide how this standard \noperates in every waiver decision.\u201d83 The court upheld \nthe Administrator\u2019s position that to deny a waiver, there \nmust be clear and compelling evidence to show that the \nproposed procedures undermine the protectiveness of \nCalifornia\u2019s standards.

This reading was upheld by \nthe D.C. Circuit in MEMA I, which concluded that this \nobligation rests firmly with opponents of the waiver in \na section 209 proceeding, holding that: \u201c[t]he language \nof the statute and its legislative history indicate that \nCalifornia\u2019s regulations, and California\u2019s determinations \nthat they must comply with the statute, when presented \nto the Administrator are presumed to satisfy the waiver \nrequirements and that the burden of proving otherwise \nis on whoever attacks them. California must present its \nregulations and findings at the hearing and thereafter \nthe parties opposing the waiver request bear the burden \nof persuading the Administrator that the waiver request \nshould be denied.\u201d86 \nThe Administrator\u2019s burden, on the other hand, is to \nmake a reasonable evaluation of the information in the \nrecord in coming to the waiver decision. As the court in \nMEMA I stated, \u201cHere, too, if the Administrator ignores \nevidence demonstrating that the waiver should not be \ngranted, or if he seeks to overcome that evidence with \nunsupported assumptions of his own, he runs the risk \nof having his waiver decision set aside as \u2018arbitrary and \ncapricious.\u2019\u201d87 Therefore, the Administrator\u2019s burden is \nto act \u201creasonably.\u201d88 \n86.\u2002  MEMA I, 627 F.2d at 1121. \n87.\u2002  Id. at 1126. \n88.\u2002  Id. \n\n110a\nIn this instance, EPA has withdrawn a previously \ngranted waiver and is now reconsidering whether that \nwithdrawal was an appropriate exercise of authority, \nwhether the reinterpretation of the second waiver prong \nwas appropriate, and whether EPA\u2019s evaluation and \nfindings of fact under the second waiver prong meet the \napplicable burden of proof in the context of deference to \nCalifornia\u2019s policy choices. EPA believes that the same \nburden that is applicable to those opposed to an initial \nwaiver request from CARB (this applies to any party \nincluding the Administrator as explained in MEMA I ) is \nalso applicable to EPA\u2019s actions in SAFE 1 ( e.g., the burden \nof proof of whether California does not need its standards \nto meet compelling and extraordinary conditions rests on \nthose opposing a waiver for California).89 \n89.\u2002  In EPA\u2019s 2009 evaluation of the 2008 GHG waiver denial the \nAgency applied a similar test. See 74 FR at 32745 (\u201cAfter a thorough \nevaluation of the record, I am withdrawing EPA\u2019s March 6, 2008 \nDenial and have determined that the most appropriate action in \nresponse to California\u2019s greenhouse gas waiver request is to grant \nthat request.

In the context of \n2009 GHG waiver that reconsidered the Agency\u2019s 2008 GHG waiver \ndenial, EPA determined it was appropriate to apply the same burden \nof proof during the reconsideration as would apply at the time of \nthe initial waiver evaluation. EPA received comment suggesting \nthat the entire burden of proof shifts to California in order for the \nprior 2008 denial to be reversed. EPA, in response, stated that \n\u201c. . . regardless of the previous waiver denial, once California makes \nits protectiveness determination the burden of proof falls on the \nopponents of the waiver . . . . This is consistent with the legislative \nhistory, which indicates that Congress intended a narrow review by \nEPA and to preserve the broadest possible discretion for California.\u201d \nId. at 32749. EPA acknowledges that in SAFE 1 the Agency not only \n\n111a\nIV.\tEPA Did Not Appropriately Exercise Its Limited \nAuthority To Reconsider the ACC Program Waiver \nin SAFE 1\nThe first question this final action tackles is whether \nthe agency properly exercised its reconsideration authority \nto withdraw its previously-granted waiver in SAFE 1. \nEPA concludes that it did not, and on that independent \nbasis rescinds SAFE 1\u2019s waiver withdrawal.\nSection 209 does not provide EPA with express \nauthority to reconsider and withdraw a waiver previously \ngranted to California. EPA\u2019s authority thus stems from its \ninherent reconsideration authority. For several reasons, \nin the context of reconsidering a waiver grant, that \nauthority may only be exercised sparingly. First, EPA \nbelieves its inherent authority to reconsider a waiver \nadopted an interpretation of the second waiver prong which was \nsimilar to the previously rejected interpretation, but that in doing \nso also questioned its previous position that the burden of proof in \nevaluating the need for standards at issue resides with those that \noppose the waiver, including EPA. See 84 FR at 51344 n.268. In \nthis action, however, EPA now finds that the historical deference \nprovided to California regarding its policy choices on how best to \naddress its serious air quality conditions also requires that the \nburden of proof should reside in those seeking to demonstrate that \nstandards are not needed under the second waiver prong regardless \nof whether the rationale is characterized as a new interpretation or \nnot. The language of section 209(b)(1) requires California to make \na protectiveness finding under the first waiver prong. Moreover, \nnothing in section 209(b) could be read as support for drawing a \ndistinction between the burden of proof when the Agency considers \nan initial waiver request and one where the Agency reconsiders \na waiver decision based on a new interpretation of the statutory \ncriteria. That burden properly resides with opponents of the waiver. \n\n112a\ndecision is constrained by the three waiver criteria that \nmust be considered before granting or denying a waiver \nrequest under section 209(b). A contrary approach, which \ntreats reconsiderations as more broadly appropriate, \nwould undermine Congress\u2019 intent that California be \nable to exercise its policy judgments and develop motor \nvehicle controls programs to address California\u2019s air \npollution problems, and make advances which could be \nbuilt on by EPA or adopted by other states. Second, EPA \nbelieves it may only reconsider a previously granted \nwaiver to address a clerical or factual error or mistake, \nor where information shows that factual circumstances or \nconditions related to the waiver criteria evaluated when \nthe waiver was granted have changed so significantly that \nthe propriety of the waiver grant is called into doubt. Even \nwhen EPA is acting within the appropriate bounds of its \nauthority to reconsider, during that reconsideration EPA \nshould exercise its limited authority within a reasonable \ntimeframe and be mindful of reliance interests.\nThe Agency\u2019s reconsideration in SAFE 1 was not an \nappropriate exercise of authority; there was no clerical \nerror or factual error in the ACC program waiver, and \nSAFE 1 did not point to any factual circumstances or \nconditions related to the three waiver prongs that had \nchanged so significantly that the propriety of the waiver \ngrant is called into doubt. Rather, the 2019 waiver \nwithdrawal was based on a change in EPA\u2019s statutory \ninterpretation, an incomplete and inaccurate assessment \nof the record, and another agency\u2019s action beyond the \nconfines of section 209(b). EPA erred in reconsidering \na previously granted waiver on these bases. Moreover, \nin considering the passage of time between the initial \n\n113a\nwaiver and the SAFE 1 action, and the development of \nreliance interests based on the waiver, EPA finds those \nfactors do not support the reconsideration of the ACC \nprogram waiver that occurred in SAFE 1. Accordingly, \nas explained in detail below, EPA is rescinding SAFE 1\u2019s \nwithdrawal of its 2013 ACC program waiver because it \nwas an inappropriate exercise of reconsideration authority.\nA.\t Comments Received\nEPA received several comments in the reconsideration \nproceeding on the Agency\u2019s authority to reconsider \nwaivers. Comments on explicit authority focused on \nwhether any language in section 209(b)(1), on its face, \npermits EPA to reconsider a previously granted waiver. \nSome of these commenters also distinguished between \nthe denial of the 2008 waiver and the reconsideration and \ngrant of the GHG waiver in 2009, and EPA\u2019s grant of the \nACC program waiver in 2013 and the reconsideration and \nwithdrawal of the ACC program waiver in 2019.\nEPA received comments in support of and against \nthe view that EPA has inherent authority to reconsider \nwaivers. As support for EPA\u2019s implied authority to \nreconsider, one commenter cited relevant language from \nthe Senate Committee Report from 1967 that stated, \n\u201cimplicit in [\u00a7209] is the right of [EPA] to withdraw the \nwaiver [if] at any time after notice and an opportunity \nfor public hearing he finds that the State of California \nno longer complies with the conditions of that waiver.\u201d90 \n90.\u2002  Urban Air Initiative (Urban Air), Docket No. EPA-HQ-\nOAR-2021-0257-0223 at 22 (quoting S.

Otherwise, EPA would be unable to monitor \nCARB\u2019s continued compliance with the waiver conditions \nin light of updated information.91 The same commenter \nalso argued that an agency generally retains the authority \nto reconsider and correct any earlier decision unless \nCongress acts to displace the authority with a process to \nrectify the Agency\u2019s mistakes and that explicit statutory \nauthority to withdraw a waiver is therefore not necessary, \nbecause \u201cthe power to reconsider is inherent in the power \nto decide.\u201d92 The commenter claimed that, under Chevron, \n\u201c[a]n agency has a \u2018continuing\u2019 statutory obligation to \nconsider the \u2018wisdom of its policy.\u2019\u201d93 \nIn contrast, several commenters maintained that \nsection 209(b) strongly indicates that EPA\u2019s authority to \n91.\u2002  Id. at 21 (\u201cA determination that California\u2019s state standards \nare technologically feasible and appropriate requires complex \ntechnical projections at the frontiers of science, which must be \ncontinually updated \u2018if the actual future course of technology \ndiverges from expectation.\u2019\u201d (quoting NRDC Inc. v.

Circuit noted that where a statute \u201cdoes \nnot contain an express provision granting [the agency] \nauthority to reconsider,\u201d \u201cadministrative agencies are \nassumed to possess at least some inherent authority to \nrevisit prior decisions, at least if done in a timely fashion,\u201d \nnoting the baseline limitations of such inherent authority. \nAnd in Chapman v.

The 1967 legislative \nhistory provides some indication of congressional intent \nto preserve some implied authority for EPA to reconsider \nprevious waiver decisions, but also to place limitations \non it. This legislative history explains: \u201c[i]mplicit in this \nprovision is the right of the [Administrator] to withdraw \nthe waiver at any time [if] after notice and an opportunity \nfor public hearing he finds that the State of California \nno longer complies with the conditions of the waiver.\u201d142 \nThus, from the earliest days of the program it has been \nunderstood that any withdrawal of a waiver should be \ntied to the statutory criteria and California\u2019s compliance \nwith them. This legislative history must be taken into \naccount along with Congress\u2019s intent expressed in the 1977 \nlegislative history, which, as discussed previously, sought \nto ensure deference to California and to strengthen that \nstate\u2019s role in driving emissions-reducing technological \ninnovation. Congress was also mindful to ensure the \nability of other states to adopt California\u2019s standards.143 \nUltimately, EPA concludes it has authority to reconsider \npreviously-granted waivers, but that this authority may \nonly be exercised sparingly. As discussed below, there are \nseveral considerations that support narrow authority to \nreconsider waiver grants. \nFirst and most important, EPA believes its inherent \nauthority to reconsider a waiver decision is constrained \nby the three waiver criteria that must be considered \nbefore granting or denying a waiver request under section \n142.\u2002  S. Rep. No. 90-403, at 34 (1967). \n143.\u2002  See supra Section III.B. \n\n134a\n209(b). It would be inappropriate and inconsistent with \ncongressional intent for EPA to reconsider and withdraw a \nwaiver on a ground outside the limited scope of those which \nCongress specified for EPA to consider when reviewing \na waiver in the first place.144 In the few instances where \nthe Agency reconsidered prior waiver decisions prior to \nSAFE 1, EPA focused its review on the section 209(b) \nstatutory waiver criteria.145 \nA circumscribed approach to reconsideration of \nwaivers is consistent with the deference to California\u2019s \npolicy judgment that Congress built into the waiver \nprocess.146 Congress explicitly required that EPA \u201cshall\u201d \ngrant the waiver unless one of three limited criteria \nare met. The use of the word \u201cshall\u201d (versus \u201cmay\u201d) \nwas heavily debated by the enacting Congress, with \nthe successful proponents of \u201cshall\u201d explaining that \nsuch language would \u201cguarantee\u201d that California could \nregulate with the burden placed on EPA to demonstrate \n144.\u2002  See MEMA I, 627 F.2d at 1115 (noting that section 209(b) \ncreates \u201ca narrowly circumscribed proceeding requiring no broad \npolicy judgments\u201d). \n145.\u2002  EPA initiated reconsideration of certain motor-cycle \nstandards, under the third waiver prong, section 209(b)(1)(C), in \norder to \u201cvacate that portion of the waiver previously granted under \nsection 209(b).\u201d 47 FR 7306, 7309 (February 18, 1982).

EPA explained that the balancing of \nrisks and costs against potential benefits from reduced \nemissions is a central policy decision for any regulatory \nagency and substantial deference should be provided to \nCalifornia\u2019s judgement on such matters.156 \nIn addition, limiting reconsideration of waivers \nundergirds Congress\u2019 intent that California would be a \nlaboratory for the country driving emissions-reducing \ntechnological innovation when it created the program in \nthe first place. As the D.C. Circuit explained in MEMA \nI: \u201cThe history of congressional consideration of the \nCalifornia waiver provision, from its original enactment up \nthrough 1977, indicates that Congress intended the State \nto continue and expand its pioneering efforts at adopting \nand enforcing motor vehicle emission standards different \nfrom and in large measure more advanced than the \ncorresponding federal program; in short, to act as a kind \nof laboratory for innovation.\u201d157 Indeed, broad authority \nto reconsider waiver grants could undermine the very \nstructure that Congress built in Title II. Specifically, while \nEPA does not consider section 177 when reviewing waiver \nrequests under section 209, Congress built a structure \nwherein EPA must grant California a waiver under section \n209 unless one of the three statutory criteria are met, and \nthen other states may adopt California\u2019s standards under \nsection 177 as part of their overall air quality programs. \n156.\u2002  40 FR at 23104. \n157.\u2002  MEMA I, 627 F.2d at 110-11. \n\n138a\nLimited inherent authority to reconsider previously-\ngranted waivers as described in this action is important \nto the success of Congress\u2019s structure. \nFinally, even the sentence in the legislative history \nthat suggests EPA has inherent reconsideration authority \nin the first place, and which SAFE 1 relied on for its \nassertion of inherent reconsideration authority, lends \nweight to the view that this authority is limited. According \nto the Senate report from the 1967 CAA amendments, \nthe Administrator has \u201cthe right . . . to withdraw the \nwaiver at any time [if] after notice and an opportunity \nfor public hearing he finds that the State of California no \nlonger complies with the conditions of the waiver.\u201d158 That \nspecific circumstance\u2014where California does not comply \nwith the conditions of a waiver\u2014should not be expanded \nto include a gaping hole for discretionary administrative \npolicy changes. \nGiven all of the above considerations, several principles \nemerge. EPA\u2019s authority to reconsider a grant of a waiver, \nwhich is an adjudicatory action by the Administrator, is \nnot open-ended. Any reconsideration is constrained to \nthe criteria that Congress set out in section 209(b). Even \nwithin those statutory criteria, considering all of the \nfactors that weigh in favor of a narrow interpretation of the \nAgency\u2019s authority and the importance of not disrupting \nCongress\u2019s scheme, EPA believes reconsideration is \nlimited to situations where the Agency has made a clerical \nor factual error or mistake, or where information shows \n158.\u2002  S.

In the context of CAA waiver grants in general, \nand the 2013 ACC program waiver grant in particular, \nCalifornia is relying on its standards to meet short- and \nlong-term emission reduction goals.159 In addition, by the \ntime the SAFE proposal was published, twelve states had \nalready adopted at least one or both of the GHG and ZEV \nstandards.160 Several of these states incorporated these \nadopted standards into their SIPs.161 Several automakers \n159.\u2002  States and Cities at 17-18. \n160.\u2002  Id. at 17. \n161.\u2002  Id. at 10; Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources \n(Wisconsin), Docket No. EPA-HQ-OAR-2021-0257-0095 at 1 (\u201cThese \nstandards provide important and necessary reductions in both GHG \nand criteria pollutant emissions needed to meet state and local air \nquality goals and address federal CAA requirements.\u201d); Connecticut \nat 2 (\u201cThese programs enable long-term planning and yield critical \nemission reductions that are critical to meeting Connecticut\u2019s climate \ngoals as well as our statutory obligations to reach attainment with \nthe ozone NAAQs.\u201d); Delaware 2 (\u201cDelaware adopted the California \nLEV regulation and incorporated the LEV and GHG standards into \nthe State Implementation Plan. . . .

Such \nreconsideration could frustrate congressional intent in \ndesigning the waiver program and ultimately discourage \nreliance by the recipient of EPA\u2019s waiver decision (CARB), \nstates that may have adopted CARB\u2019s regulations under \nthe terms of section 177 (and are permitted to enforce \nthe regulations once EPA grants a waiver to California) \nas well as the regulated industry.\nWe now turn to whether the reconsideration in SAFE \n1 was a proper exercise of EPA\u2019s inherent reconsideration \nauthority. As an initial matter, SAFE 1 did not assert \nthat any clerical or factual error or mistake was made \nin the 2013 ACC program waiver. Nor did SAFE 1 point \nto any evidence showing that factual circumstances or \nconditions related to the waiver criteria evaluated when \nthe waiver was granted have changed so significantly that \nmaintain the health-based National Ambient Air Quality Standards \n(NAAQS) . . . The California ZEV and GHG programs enable long-\nterm planning for both the states and the regulated community and \nhave been drivers of technological change across the industry.\u201d). \n162.\u2002  E.g., Ford at 1; Tesla at n.5, 4; Rivian (as a member of \nNCAT) at 13-14. \n\n141a\nthe propriety of the waiver grant is called into doubt. For \nexample, SAFE 1 did not assert that California was not \ncomplying with the terms of the waiver. Instead, SAFE 1\u2019s \nreconsideration was premised on retroactive application \nof discretionary policy changes. Therefore, EPA believes \nit did not appropriately exercise its inherent authority in \nSAFE 1 to reconsider the prior ACC program waiver. \nUpon reconsideration, and as further shown in Sections \nV and VI, EPA now believes that SAFE 1 amounted to \nan improper exercise of the Agency\u2019s limited inherent \nauthority to reconsider.163 \nSAFE 1 gave two primary reasons for withdrawing \nthe 2013 ACC program waiver. Neither was an appropriate \n163.\u2002  EPA acknowledges that, in the SAFE 1 proceedings, it had \nnoted that at the time of proposal that CARB had given notice that \nit was considering amending its \u201cdeemed to comply\u201d provision and \nthat by the time of SAFE 1, California had entered into agreements \nwith several automobile manufacturers to accept less stringent \nstandards than the California program or the Federal standards \nas promulgated in 2012. As noted in SAFE 1, EPA believed that \nneither of these matters were necessary for EPA\u2019s action in SAFE \n1, but that they provided further support for the action. 84 FR at \n51334 n.230. By this action, EPA finds that neither of these matters \namounted to a change in circumstances or conditions associated \nwith the three waiver criteria and EPA\u2019s evaluation of the criteria in \nthe ACC program waiver. EPA did not predicate its ACC program \nwaiver on CARB\u2019s deemed-to-comply provision or any changes to \nthe deemed-to-comply provision. (EPA does not take a position as \nto whether that provision has changed in its purpose as a result of \nCARB\u2019s 2018 amendment). Further, to the extent CARB utilized a \ndeemed-to-comply provision or uses non-regulatory mechanisms \nto achieve its air quality objectives, this had no bearing on EPA\u2019s \nassessment of whether CARB has a need for its standards under the \nsecond waiver prong at the time of SAFE 1 or now. \n\n142a\nbasis for reconsideration. First, SAFE 1 premised the \nrevocation on its interpretation of the second waiver \nprong, section 209(b)(1)(B), that called for the Agency\u2019s \nscrutiny of specific standards under the waiver rather than \nCalifornia\u2019s program as a whole. As explained in detail in \nSection V of this final action, that statutory interpretation \nis flawed, and EPA does not believe a new statutory \ninterpretation should be the basis of reconsidering the \ngrant of a waiver.\nSAFE 1 premised the withdrawal of the ACC program \nwaiver under section 209(b)(1)(B) on the perceived lack of \nrecord support on the causal link between GHG emission \nstandards and air quality conditions in California.164 Yet, \nthe underlying record from the ACC program waiver, \nand the record of SAFE 1, have shown that CARB\u2019s \nZEV sales mandate and GHG emission standards are \ndesigned to address California\u2019s serious air quality \nproblems, including both its NAAQS pollutants and \na variety of climate impacts from GHG emissions. As \ndiscussed in greater detail in Section V, EPA has since \nat least 2009 recognized that greenhouse gas pollution \nexacerbates criteria pollution, and climate change \nimpacts on California\u2019s air quality conditions ( e.g., heat \n164.\u2002  \u201cCalifornia\u2019s approach in its ACC program waiver request \ndiffered from the state\u2019s approach in its waiver request for MY 2011 \nand subsequent heavy-duty tractor-trailer GHG standards, where \nCalifornia quantified NO X emissions reductions attributed to GHG \nstandards and explained that they would contribute to PM and ozone \nNAAQS attainment.\u201d 84 FR at 51337 n.252 (citing 79 FR at 46256, \n46257 n.15, 46261, 46262 n.75). \n\n143a\nexacerbation of ozone).165 The ACC program was especially \ndesigned to address both criteria and GHG pollution, \n165.\u2002  The first HD GHG emissions standard waiver related to \ncertain new 2011 and subsequent model year tractor-trailers. 79 FR \n46256 (August 7, 2014).

This, too, was an \ninappropriate ground for reconsideration. As earlier \nnoted, EPA believes its inherent authority to reconsider a \nwaiver decision is constrained by the three waiver criteria \nthat must be considered before granting or denying a \nwaiver request under section 209(b). Preemption under \nEPCA is not one of these criteria and was not considered \nin CARB\u2019s ACC program waiver request or in EPA\u2019s \ngranting of that waiver. In fact, in its waiver grant, the \nAgency expressly found that consideration of preemption \nunder EPCA would be inappropriate and unnecessary. \nIn SAFE 1, the Agency did not premise its consideration \nof preemption under EPCA on any of the three statutory \ncriteria. Therefore, EPA believes that SAFE 1 was not \na proper exercise of the authority to reconsider on this \nbasis, and any subsequent action in SAFE 1 to withdraw \nthe ACC program waiver was inappropriate.\nAlthough SAFE 1 was an inappropriate exercise of \ninherent authority given that the Agency did not correct \na factual error and there was no change in factual \n\n146a\ncircumstances so significant that the propriety of the \nwaiver would be called into doubt, it is nevertheless \nrelevant to note that SAFE 1 did not give appropriate \nconsideration to the passage of time and the reliance \ninterests that had developed between the granting and \nthe revocation of the ACC program waiver. Several \nautomakers and industry groups have also indicated \nreliance on these standards, as previously discussed.170 \nCalifornia and section 177 states were, by the time \nof the reconsideration, into the long-term plans they \nhad developed relying on the ACC program waiver \nstandards.171 California and other states rely on waivers \n170.\u2002  E.g., Ford at 1; Tesla at n.5, 4; Rivian (as a member of \nNCAT) at 13-14. EPA notes that it received limited comment on \nwhether reliance interests had formed since the issuance of SAFE \n1 but nothing to demonstrate error in the findings regarding section \n209(b)(1)(C) made within the ACC program waiver. See Toyota, \nDocket No. EPA-HQ-OAR-2021-0381 (\u201cReinstatement of California\u2019s \nwaiver for model years 2021 and 2022 poses significant lead time \nchallenges considering that 2021 model year is well underway, and \n2022 model year vehicles are generally already designed, sourced, \ncertified to various regulatory requirements, and ready to begin \nproduction.\u201d). Further, as discussed elsewhere, the short passage of \ntime since the promulgation of SAFE 1 and ongoing litigation over \nthat action has, as automakers have noted in that briefing, prevented \nautomakers from relying on the waiver revocation. See also Twelve \nPublic Interest Organizations at 11 (noting filings by automakers \nsuggesting lack of reliance on the waiver withdrawal). \n171.\u2002  E.g., States and Cities at 17 (the length between the \nwaiver grant and reconsideration was too long \u201cby any measure.\u201d); \nTwelve Public Interest Organizations at app. 36. EPA acknowledges \nthe commenter who argued that \u201ctimeliness depends on reliance \ninterests\u201d and, because the standards were not final before the MTE, \nthe time period at issue is the four months between the MTE and \n\n147a\nthat EPA has approved to meet short- and long-term \nemission reduction goals.172 In addition, by the time \nthe SAFE 1 proposal. Urban Air at 24. EPA also received comment \nthat disagreed with this accounting of time stating that timeliness \nfor reconsidering an adjudication is measured from the date of the \nagency\u2019s decision, not from the date of activity resulting from that \ndecision. E.g., Am. Methyl, 749 F.2d at 835 (tethering timeliness \nto period for appeal of agency decision).\u201d Twelve Public Interest \nOrganizations app. 1 at 38. EPA believes it is not necessary to resolve \nthe permissible amount of time, or the existence or lack of a bright \nline, that may pass before reconsideration of its prior adjudication \nis no longer appropriate. However, EPA did not \u201ccondition\u201d its \nACC program waiver on any subsequent actions, including the \nMTE, which explicitly applied to the federal standards. See 78 FR \nat 2137. EPA expects its waiver adjudications to be final and that \nappropriate reliance may flow to affected parties. Moreover, in this \ninstance EPA did not make any final determination regarding the \nthird waiver prong at section 209(b)(1)(C). EPA notes that it has \nadministered the California waiver program for a number of decades \nand acknowledges that emission standards continue to evolve at the \nCalifornia and the federal levels. This evolution in the standards has \nrested on regulatory certainty and the enforceability of CARB\u2019s \nemission standards once a waiver has been issued by EPA under \nsection 209(b) of the CAA. As for the inclusion of the deemed-to-\ncomply provision in the California standards, California provided \ndocumentation demonstrating that the deemed-to-comply provision \nwas reliant upon the federal standards having a certain level of \nstringency, a fact that EPA had recognized. See States and Cities \nat 18-19 n. 14, 57-60. EPA found that the California standards were \nfeasible even without the deemed-to-comply provision, 78 FR at 2138, \nmaking it irrelevant to the waiver grant. California\u2019s own actions \nwith respect to its standards, such as its independent review of the \nACC program, cannot disturb California\u2019s or other state\u2019s reliance \non the federal waiver. \n172.\u2002  States and Cities at 17-18. \n\n148a\nthe SAFE proposal was published, twelve states had \nalready adopted at least one or both of the GHG and ZEV \nstandards.173 Several of these states incorporated these \nadopted standards into their SIPs.174 \nSAFE 1 barely mentioned these reliance interests, \nexplaining only that the Agency \u201cwill consider whether \nand how to address SIP implications of this action, to the \nextent that they exist, in separate actions; EPA believes \nthat it is not necessary to resolve those implications in \nthe course of this action.\u201d175 EPA now believes that, when \nexercising its inherent authority to reconsider the 2013 \nwaiver decision, it was inappropriate to ignore these \npossible reliance interests and to \u201cresolve\u201d any potential \n173.\u2002  Id. at 17. \n174.\u2002  Id. at 10; Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources \n(Wisconsin), Docket No. EPA-HQ-OAR-2021-0257-0095 at 1 (\u201cThese \nstandards provide important and necessary reductions in both GHG \nand criteria pollutant emissions needed to meet state and local air \nquality goals and address federal CAA requirements.\u201d); Connecticut \nat 2 (\u201cThese programs enable long-term planning and yield critical \nemission reductions that are critical to meeting Connecticut\u2019s climate \ngoals as well as our statutory obligations to reach attainment with \nthe ozone NAAQs.\u201d); Delaware 2 (\u201cDelaware adopted the California \nLEV regulation and incorporated the LEV and GHG standards into \nthe State Implementation Plan. . . .

In the SAFE 1 context, while \nit was not necessary to resolve the status of every SIP, \nit was inappropriate to not even consider the reliance \ninterests raised by the adoption of California standards \nby section 177 states (including, but not limited to, their \nadoption into SIPs). EPA has consistently recognized the \nimportance of long-term planning in the attainment and \nmaintenance of NAAQS.176 Given the long-term nature of \nthese plans, it is \u201cchallenging (if not impossible) to change \nthem quickly,\u201d and any changes in one part of a SIP can \naffect multiple sectors of the economy.177 \n176.\u2002  EPA is responsible for approving SIPs and SIP \namendments, which span years. See, e.g., 82 FR 42233 (September \n7, 2017) (approval of Maine\u2019s SIP revision including updates to be \nconsistent with California\u2019s updated LEV program); 80 FR 13768 \n(March 17, 2015) (approval of Connecticut\u2019s SIP revision, including \nthe adoption of elements of California\u2019s LEV program). For example, \nstates with areas that achieve attainment for any air pollutant must \nsubmit for EPA approval a revised SIP that sets out the State\u2019s \nplan for maintaining attainment for at least ten years after the \nredesignation. At the end of that ten-year period, the State must \nsubmit another ten-year maintenance plan to EPA for approval. 42 \nU.S.C. 7505a. \n177.\u2002  Twelve Public Interest Organizations app. 1 at 29, 30. \nSeveral states also commented, during this reconsideration, that they \nrely on the California GHG standards and ZEV sales mandate to \nreach their own state emission reduction goals. E.g., Connecticut at 2 \n(\u201cReducing GHG emissions from the transportation sector is required \nto achieve Connecticut\u2019s economy-wide targets of at least 45 percent \nbelow 2001 levels by 2030 and 80 percent below 2001 levels by 2050, \nas required by the 2008 Global Warming Solutions Act (GWSA) and \nthe 2018 Act Concerning Climate Change Planning and Resiliency.\u201d); \nMinnesota at 2 (\u201c[California\u2019s standards] are vitally important in \nhelping our state achieve our GHG emission reduction goals and \n\n150a\nAs noted above, EPA also received other comments \nregarding reliance interests, including those noting that \nthe midterm evaluation (MTE) was an indication that the \ntechnological feasibility of the GHG emission standards \nwas not a settled matter and hence no certainty or reliance \ncould accrue. EPA, however, did not \u201ccondition\u201d its ACC \nprogram waiver on any subsequent actions, including the \nMTE.178 EPA expects its waiver adjudications to be final \nand that appropriate reliance may flow to affected parties. \nMoreover, in this instance EPA did not make any final \ndetermination regarding the third waiver prong at section \n209(b)(1)(C). EPA notes that it has administered the \nCalifornia waiver program for a number of decades and \nacknowledges that emission standards continue to evolve \nat the California and the federal levels. This evolution in \nthe standards has rested on regulatory certainty and the \nenforceability of CARB\u2019s emission standards once a waiver \nhas been issued by EPA under section 209(b) of the CAA. \nEPA\u2019s historic practice of properly affording broad \ndiscretion to California has meant that in almost fifty \nreduce other harmful air pollutants, especially in communities of \ncolor and lower-income communities, which are disproportionately \nimpacted by vehicle pollution. The MPCA found that these rules are \nneeded to address GHG emissions in our state and take steps towards \nachieving Minnesota\u2019s statutory Next Generation Energy Act GHG \nreduction goals. On May 7, 2021, an independent Administrative \nLaw Judge affirmed the MPCA findings.\u201d); Maine at 1 n.3 (\u201cMaine \nstatute at 38 M.R.S 576-A establishes tiered GHG emission reduction \nrequirements culminating in gross annual reductions of at least 80% \nfrom 1990 baseline levels.\u201d). \n178.\u2002  See 78 FR at 2137. \n\n151a\nyears of administering the California waiver program the \nAgency had never withdrawn any waiver prior to SAFE \n1. And while SAFE 1 cited prior reconsideration actions \nas support for the Agency\u2019s authority to reconsider prior \nwaiver decisions, as previously noted, EPA has historically \nlimited reconsideration of prior waived standards to \nstatutory criteria and most important, none of these \nprior reconsideration actions resulted in a revocation.179 \nAs further shown in Sections V and VI, SAFE 1 was the \nresult of a \u201cprobing substantive review of the California \nstandards,\u201d with the Agency substituting its own \njudgment for California\u2019s contrary to both congressional \nexhortation of deference to California and the Agency\u2019s \nreview practice. \nThis present reconsideration is an appropriate \nexercise of the Agency\u2019s reconsideration authority. It is not \nat all clear that the reasons for limiting reconsideration of \nwaiver grants apply to the same degree to reconsideration \nof waiver denials and withdrawals. However, EPA need not \nresolve the question in this action, because this action falls \nwell within the bounds of even the limited authority this \naction concludes the Agency possesses for reconsideration \nof waiver grants. First, this action corrects factual errors \nmade in the SAFE 1 waiver withdrawal. Specifically, \neven under SAFE 1\u2019s flawed interpretation of section \n209(b)(1)(B), SAFE 1 ignored facts demonstrating that \nCalifornia does need the specific standards at issue to meet \n179.\u2002  See, e.g., 43 FR at 7310 (affirming the grant of the waiver \nin the absence of \u201cfindings necessary to revoke California\u2019s waiver of \nFederal preemption for its motorcycle fill-pipe and fuel tank opening \nregulations.\u201d). \n\n152a\ncompelling and extraordinary conditions. Second, in this \nreconsideration EPA properly constrains its analysis to \nwhether SAFE 1 made one of the three statutory findings \nnecessary to deny a waiver. Third, this reconsideration \nis timely with respect to the finalization of SAFE 1 and \nlimited, if any, reliance interests have developed as a result \nof SAFE 1 (which has been subject to judicial review since \nits promulgation).\nC.\t Conclusion\nIn SAFE 1, EPA inappropriately exercised its limited \ninherent authority to reconsider the ACC program \nwaiver for several reasons. EPA believes its exercise of \nreconsideration authority to reinterpret the language of \nsection 209(b)(1)(B) was not taken to correct any factual \nor clerical error or based upon factual circumstances or \nconditions related to the waiver criteria evaluated when \nthe waiver was granted that have changed so significantly \nthat the propriety of the waiver grant is called into doubt. \nRather, as discussed in detail in Section V, it was based \nupon a flawed statutory interpretation and a misapplication \nof the facts under that interpretation. Likewise, EPA\u2019s \ndecision to reconsider the ACC program waiver based on \nNHTSA\u2019s rulemaking within SAFE 1, which raised issues \nbeyond the statutory waiver criteria, was inappropriate. \nFor these reasons EPA now believes it is appropriate to \nrescind its actions within SAFE 1.\n\n153a\nV.\t The SAFE 1 Interpretation of Section 209(b)(1)(B) \nwas Inappropriate and, in any Event, California \nmet its Requirements\nEven if SAFE 1\u2019s reconsideration of the 2013 program \nwaiver grant was appropriate, EPA concludes for two \nindependent reasons that its waiver withdrawal in SAFE \n1 based upon its new statutory interpretation was flawed. \nFirst, EPA concludes that the SAFE 1 interpretation of \nthe second waiver prong was not an appropriate reading \nof that second waiver prong, section 209(b)(1)(B). It bears \nnoting that the traditional interpretation is, at least, the \nbetter interpretation. Informed by but separate from the \nfactual analysis discussed next, the Agency finds that the \nnew interpretation set out in SAFE 1 was inconsistent \nwith congressional intent and contrary to the purpose \nof section 209(b). Under the traditional interpretation \nof the second waiver prong, California\u2019s need for its \nown motor vehicle program, including its GHG emission \nstandards and ZEV sales mandate, to meet compelling and \nextraordinary conditions is clear and the waiver should \nnot have been withdrawn. \nSecond, even if the interpretation in SAFE 1 were \nappropriate, EPA concludes that SAFE 1 incorrectly \nfound that California did not have a need for its specific \nstandards. EPA has evaluated California\u2019s need for both \nrequirements by applying both the traditional and the \nSAFE 1 interpretations of section 209(b)(1)(B). In doing \nso, EPA reviewed the record from the ACC program \nwaiver proceedings, including CARB\u2019s ACC program \nwaiver request and supporting documents, as well as the \ncomments received as part of the SAFE 1 proceeding and \n\n154a\nthe comments received under the present reconsideration \nof SAFE 1.180 The record review focused on salient \npronouncements and findings in the ACC program waiver \ndecision, such as the relationship of both criteria and \nGHG pollutants and the impacts of climate change on \nCalifornia\u2019s serious air quality conditions. For example, \nthe effects of climate change and the heat exacerbation \nof tropospheric ozone is well established. California\u2019s \nACC program is established, in part, to address this. \nCalifornia\u2019s program, including its GHG emission \nstandards, is also designed to address upstream criteria \nemission pollutants. The review did so primarily because \nSAFE 1 premised the withdrawal of the GHG standards at \nissue on the lack of a causal link between GHG standards \nand air quality conditions in California. The review \nincluded EPA\u2019s prior findings regarding heat exacerbation \nof ozone, a serious air quality issue recognized by EPA \nas presenting compelling and extraordinary conditions \nunder the second waiver prong. \n180.\u2002  EPA notes that it reviewed the factual record within the \nACC program waiver proceeding and finds there was no factual error \nin its evaluation of whether CARB\u2019s standards satisfied the second \nwaiver prong. EPA also notes, merely as confirming the finding it \nmade at the time of the ACC program waiver but not for purposes of \nmaking a new factual finding from that made at the time of the ACC \nprogram waiver decision, that the record and information contained \nin the SAFE 1 proceeding as well as the record and information \ncontained in the Agency\u2019s reconsideration of SAFE 1 (including late \ncomments submitted during the SAFE 1 proceeding and, in some \ncases, resubmitted during the Agency\u2019s reconsideration of SAFE 1) \nat each point in time clearly demonstrates the need of California\u2019s \nstandards (whether evaluated as a program or as specific standards) \nto meet compelling and extraordinary conditions within California. \n\n155a\nOn completion of this review, EPA finds no basis for \ndiscounting the ample record support on California\u2019s \nneed for both the GHG standards and the ZEV sales \nmandate to address compelling and extraordinary \nconditions in California when using both the traditional \nand SAFE 1 interpretation to the second waiver prong. \nAdditionally, because of the way CARB\u2019s motor vehicle \nemission standards operate in tandem and are designed \nto reduce both criteria and GHG pollution and the ways \nin which GHG pollution exacerbates California\u2019s serious \nair quality problems, including the heat exacerbation of \nozone, the Agency in SAFE 1 should not have evaluated \nCalifornia\u2019s specific \u201cneed\u201d for GHG standards. In sum, \nin reconsidering SAFE 1, and after having now reviewed \nand evaluated the complete factual record, EPA reaffirms \nthat California needs the GHG standards and ZEV sales \nmandate at issue to \u201cmeet compelling and extraordinary \nconditions.\u201d\nA.\t Historical Practice\nUnder section 209(b)(1)(B), EPA shall not grant a \nwaiver if California \u201cdoes not need such State standards \nto meet compelling and extraordinary conditions.\u201d For \nnearly the entire history of the waiver program, EPA has \nread the phrase \u201csuch State standards\u201d in section 209(b)\n(1)(B) as referring back to standards \u201cin the aggregate,\u201d \nin the root paragraph of section 209(b)(1), which calls \nfor California to make a protectiveness finding for its \nstandards. EPA has interpreted the phrase \u201cin the \naggregate\u201d as referring to California\u2019s program as a \nwhole, rather than each State standard, and as such not \n\n156a\ncalling for the Agency\u2019s standard-by-standard analysis of \nCalifornia\u2019s waiver request.181 EPA has thus reasoned that \nboth statutory provisions must be read together so that \nthe Agency reviews the same standards that California \nconsiders in making its protectiveness determination and \nto afford California discretion.182 The D.C. Circuit has \nalso stated that \u201c[t]he expansive statutory language gives \nCalifornia (and in turn EPA) a good deal of flexibility in \nassessing California\u2019s regulatory needs.

In 2008, EPA for the first time \nanalyzed California\u2019s waiver request under an alternative \napproach and denied CARB\u2019s waiver request. EPA concluded \nthat section 209(b) was intended to allow California to \npromulgate state standards applicable to emissions from \nnew motor vehicles to address air pollution problems that \nare local or regional, but that section 209(b)(1)(B) was not \nintended to allow California to promulgate state standards \nfor emissions from new motor vehicles designed to address \nglobal climate change problems. Or, in the alternative, \nEPA concluded that effects of climate change in California \nwere not compelling and extraordinary compared to the \neffects in the rest of the country.189 EPA rejected this view \na little over a year later in 2009 by applying the traditional \ninterpretation in granting California\u2019s waiver request for \nthe same GHG standard, finding no support in the statute \nor congressional intent for the alternative application of \nthe statute.190 \n188.\u2002  74 FR at 32763-65; 76 FR 34693; 79 FR 46256; 81 FR \n95982. \n189.\u2002  73 FR at 12160-64. \n190.\u2002  74 FR at 32744, 32746, 32763 (\u201cThe text of section 209(b) \nand the legislative history, when viewed together, lead me to reject \nthe interpretation adopted in the March 6, 2008 Denial, and to \napply the traditional interpretation to the evaluation of California\u2019s \ngreenhouse gas standards for motor vehicles.

EPA noted that to the extent that it was \nappropriate to examine the CARB\u2019s need for the GHG \nstandards at issue to meet compelling and extraordinary \nconditions, the Agency had discussed at length in the 2009 \nGHG waiver decision that California has compelling and \nbroadest possible discretion in adopting the kind of standards in its \nmotor vehicle program that California determines are appropriate \nto address air pollution problems and protect the health and welfare \nof its citizens. The better interpretation of the text and legislative \nhistory of this provision is that Congress did not use this criterion \nto limit California\u2019s discretion to a certain category of air pollution \nproblems, to the exclusion of others. EPA concluded that even under \nthis alternative approach California GHG standards were intended \nat least in part to address a local or regional problem because of \nthe \u2018logical link between the local air pollution problem of ozone \nand GHG.\u2019\u201d). \n191.\u2002  78 FR at 2129 (\u201cCARB has repeatedly demonstrated \nthe need for its motor vehicle program to address compelling and \nextraordinary conditions in California.

CARB also notes that the \u201ccritical nature \nof the LEV III regulation is also highlighted in the recent effort to \ntake a coordinated look at strategies to meet California\u2019s multiple \nair quality and climate goals well into the future. This coordinated \nplanning effort, Vision for Clean Air: A Framework for Air Quality \nand Climate Planning (Vision for Clean Air) demonstrates the \nmagnitude of the technology and energy transformation needed \nfrom the transportation sector and associated energy production \nto meet federal standards and the goals set forth by California\u2019s \nclimate change requirements. . . . The Vision for Clean Air effort \nillustrates that in addition to the cleanup of passenger vehicles (at \nissue here) as soon as possible as required in the LEV III regulation, \ntransition to zero- and near-zero emission technologies in all on- and \noff-road engine categories is necessary to achieve the coordinated \ngoals. Therefore, EPA believes that CARB\u2019s 2018 and later MY ZEV \nstandards represent a reasonable pathway to reach these longer \nterm goals. Under EPA\u2019s traditional practice of affording CARB the \nbroadest discretion possible, and deferring to CARB on its policy \nchoices, we believe there is a rational connection between California \nZEV standards and its attainment of long term air quality goals. \nWhether or not the ZEV standards achieve additional reductions \nby themselves above and beyond the LEV III GHG and criteria \npollutant standards, the LEV III program overall does achieve \nsuch reductions, and EPA defers to California\u2019s policy choice of the \nappropriate technology path to pursue to achieve these emissions \nreductions.\u201d (footnote omitted)). \n\n164a\n(B) called for a \u201cparticularized nexus\u201d for California\u2019s \nmotor vehicle standards: \u201cCongress enacted the waiver \nauthority for California under section 209(b) against the \nbackdrop of traditional, criteria pollutant environmental \nproblems, under which all three links in this chain bear a \nparticularized nexus to specific local California features: \n(1) Criteria pollutants are emitted from the tailpipes of the \nCalifornia motor vehicle fleet; (2) those emissions of criteria \npollutants contribute to air pollution by concentrating \nlocally in elevated ambient levels, which concentration, in \nturn; (3) results in health and welfare effects ( e.g., from \nozone) that are extraordinarily aggravated in California \nas compared to other parts of the country, with this \nextraordinary situation being attributable to a confluence \nof California\u2019s peculiar characteristics, e.g., population \ndensity, transportation patterns, wind and ocean currents, \ntemperature inversions, and topography.\u201d195 As support for \nthe nexus test, EPA, for the first time in waiver decisions, \nrelied on section 202(a) and its own terms of authority to \ninform interpretation of the second waiver prong.196 In \naddition, EPA relied on legislative history to interpret \n\u201ccompelling and extraordinary\u201d conditions as a reference \nto \u201cpeculiar local conditions\u201d and \u201cunique problems\u201d in \nCalifornia.197 Accordingly, EPA reasoned that California \n195.\u2002  84 FR at 51339. \n196.\u2002  Id. at 51339-40. \n197.\u2002  Id. at 51342 (quoting S.

In \naddition, as EPA has explained in the past, reading the \nprovision otherwise would conflict with Congress\u2019s 1977 \namendment to the waiver provision to allow California\u2019s \nstandards to be \u201cat least as protective\u201d as the federal \nstandards \u201cin the aggregate.\u201d This amendment must \nmean that some of California\u2019s standards may be weaker \nthan federal standards counterbalanced by others that \nare stronger. If, however, a waiver can only be granted if \neach standard on its own meets a compelling need, then \nCalifornia could never have a standard that is weaker \nthan the federal standard, rendering Congress\u2019s 1977 \n\n182a\namendment inoperative. Congress would not have created \nthe option for California\u2019s individual standards to be at \nleast as protective \u201cin the aggregate\u201d and then taken that \noption away in the second waiver prong\u2019s \u201ccompelling \nneed\u201d inquiry.\nIn addition, EPA has reasoned that giving effect to \nsection 209(b)(1) means that both subparagraph (b)(1)\n(B) and paragraph (b)(1) must be read together such that \nthe Agency reviews the same standards that California \nconsiders in making its protectiveness determination. \n\u201c\u00a7209 (formerly \u00a7208) was amended to require the U.S. \nEnvironmental Protection Agency (EPA) to consider \nCalifornia\u2019s standards as a package, so that California \ncould seek a waiver of preemption if its standards \u2018in \nthe aggregate\u2019 protected public health at least as well as \nfederal standards.\u201d238 \nEPA has thus explained the reasoning for the reading \nof \u201csuch State standards\u201d for instance, as follows:\n[I]f Congress had intended a review of the \nneed for each individual standard under (b)(1)(B), \nit is unlikely that it would have used the phrase \n\u201c. . . does not need such state standards,\u201d which \napparently refers back to the phrase \u201cState \nstandards . . . in the aggregate,\u201d as used in the \nfirst sentence of section 209(b)(1), rather than \nto the particular standard being considered. \n238.\u2002  Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

Since \n1967, in various amendments to section 209, Congress has \nalso not disturbed this reading of section 209(b)(1)(B) as \ncalling for the review of the standards as a whole program. \nLikewise, Congress has also not placed any additional \nconstraints on California\u2019s ability to obtain waivers beyond \nthose now contained in section 209(b)(1). The Agency has \nthus viewed the text, legislative history, and structure of \nsection 209(b)(1) as support for the program-level review of \nwaiver requests as well for the conclusion that California\u2019s \nair quality need not be worse than the rest of the country \nfor EPA to grant a waiver of preemption. In addition, \nto the extent that SAFE 1 was intended to preclude \nCalifornia\u2019s regulation of all greenhouse gases from \nlight-duty vehicles, the SAFE 1 interpretation creates \na structural conflict within the relevant CAA provisions \nand could also create an inability for California to address \nGHG emissions and its contribution to the serious air \nquality problems within the State. There is a fundamental \nrelationship between sections 209(a) and 209(b).

Nevertheless, to the extent that \nSAFE 1 was intended to preclude all California regulation \nof greenhouse gases, EPA believes it improper to exclude \nentirely a pollutant from a waiver under section 209(b) \nthat is otherwise preempted by section 209(a). \nIn addition, Congress has cited California\u2019s GHG \nstandards and ZEV sales mandate in subsequent \nlegislation.

However, because the Agency \nasserted in SAFE 1 that the equal sovereignty doctrine \nformed a gloss on its statutory interpretation of the three \ncriteria, EPA addresses that argument here briefly. In short, \nin SAFE 1, EPA stated that because section 209(b)(1) \nprovides \u201cextraordinary treatment\u201d to California, the \nsecond waiver prong should be interpreted to require a \n\u201cstate-specific\u201d and \u201cparticularized\u201d pollution problem. 257 \nBut section 177\u2019s grant of authority to other states to adopt \nCalifornia\u2019s standards undermines the notion that the \nregulatory scheme treats California in an extraordinary \nmanner. Indeed, if section 209(b) is interpreted to limit the \ntypes of air pollution that California may regulate, it would \ndiminish the sovereignty of California and the states \nthat adopt California\u2019s standards pursuant to section \n177 without enhancing any other state\u2019s sovereignty. \nNor does section 209(b) impose any burden on any state. \nFor these reasons, EPA agrees with commenters who \nargued that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Shelby \nCounty is inapposite. In section 209(b), Congress did \nnot authorize \u201cfederal intrusion into sensitive areas of \nstate and local policymaking.\u201d258 Rather, it underscored a \nfoundational principle of federalism\u2014allowing California \nto be a laboratory for innovation. Nor is section 209(b) \nan \u201cextraordinary departure from the traditional \ncourse of relations between the States and the Federal \nGovernment.\u201d259 To the contrary, it is just one of many \n257.\u2002  84 FR 51340, 51347. \n258.\u2002  Shelby County v.

But nothing in section \n209(b)(1)(B) can be read as calling for scrutinizing the \nspecific California standards under the waiver.260 Under \nsection 209(b)(1)(B), EPA is to grant a waiver unless \nCalifornia does not need \u201csuch State standards\u201d (plural). \nEPA interprets section 209(b)(1)(B) to refer back to the \nphrase \u201cin the aggregate\u201d in section 209(b)(1), which was \nadded in the 1977 CAA Amendments when Congress \n260.\u2002  In the 2009 GHG waiver, and again in the 2013 ACC \nprogram waiver, EPA explained that the traditional approach does \nnot make section 209(b)(1)(B) a nullity, as EPA must still determine \nwhether California does not need its motor vehicle program to \nmeet compelling and extraordinary conditions as discussed in the \nlegislative history. Conditions in California may one day improve such \nthat it may no longer have a need for its motor vehicle program, or a \nprogram designed for a particular type of air pollution problem, if \nthe underlying specific air pollutant is no longer at issue. \n\n192a\nremoved the stringency requirements for waiver of \nCalifornia standards allowing instead for standards that \nare not as stringent as comparable federal standards, so \nlong as the standards were \u201cin the aggregate, at least \nas protective of public health and welfare as applicable \nFederal standards.\u201d EPA believes that referring back \nto section 209(b)(1) is appropriate given that it precedes \nthe language prior to section 209(b)(1)(B) and is in \naccord with the deference Congress intended by the 1977 \nAmendments.261 Conversely, EPA believes that under the \nSAFE 1 interpretation California would, of necessity, be \nrequired to make a protectiveness finding for each of the \nspecific standards, and the Agency believes this would be \nan inappropriate outcome from SAFE 1. Under the 1977 \nAmendments, California can \u201cinclude some less stringent \n[standards] than the corresponding federal standards.\u201d262 \nAs previously explained, \u201cCongress could not have given \nthis flexibility to California and simultaneously assigned \nto the state the seemingly impossible task of establishing \nthat \u2018extraordinary and compelling conditions\u2019 exist for \neach standard.\u201d263 \n261.\u2002  EPA had applied the traditional interpretation of the \nsecond waiver prong prior to the 1977 Amendments. \n262.\u2002  See H.R.

Indeed, section 209(b)(1)(C) \ninvolves an analysis of feasibility that can take more than \nthe feasibility and impacts of the new standards into \naccount. The feasibility assessment conducted for a new \nwaiver request focuses on the standards in that request \nbut builds on the previous feasibility assessments made \nfor the standards already in the program and assesses any \nnew feasibility risks created by the interaction between \nthe standards in the petition and the existing standards.265 \nIn sum, EPA now views as inconsistent with \ncongressional intent the SAFE 1 interpretation, which was \na flawed interpretation and also a significant departure \nfrom the traditional interpretation under which the \n264.\u2002  Section 209(b)(1)(C) provides that no such waiver shall \nbe granted if the Administrator finds that \u201csuch State standards \nand accompanying enforcement procedures are not consistent with \nsection 7521(a) [202(a)] of this title.\u201d \n265.\u2002  For example, in the 2013 ACC waiver that contains CARB\u2019s \nLEV III criteria pollutant standards and GHG emission standards, \nas well as the ZEV sales mandate, EPA assessed information \nsubmitted by CARB regarding the technological feasibility, lead \ntime available to meet the requirements, and the cost of compliance \nand the technical and resource challenges manufacturers face in \ncomplying with the requirements to simultaneously reduce criteria \nand GHG emissions. 78 FR at 2131. \n\n194a\nAgency reviews California\u2019s need for the same standards \nas those that the State determines are \u201cin the aggregate\u201d \nas protective of public health and welfare, under section \n209(b)(1).266 EPA believes the traditional interpretation \nis, at least, the better reading of the statute. \nAs previously explained, in reviewing waiver requests \nEPA has applied the traditional interpretation in the same \nway for all air pollutants, criteria and GHG pollutants \n266.\u2002  84 FR at 51345.

Under \nsection 209(b)(1)(C), EPA conducts review of standards California \nhas submitted to EPA for the grant of a waiver to determine if they \nare consistent with section 202(a). It follows then that EPA must read \n\u2018such state standards\u2019 in section 209(b)(1)(B) as a reference to the same \nstandards in subsection (C).\u201d Although the Agency has not pointed \nto 209(b)(1)(C) as a basis of statutory construction to support the \ntraditional interpretation of 209(b)(1)(B), EPA nevertheless believes \nit is supportive. EPA notes that the term \u201csuch state standards\u201d in \n209(b)(1)(C) allows the Agency, in appropriate circumstances, to \nreview the consistency of CARB\u2019s suite of standards, for a particular \nvehicle category, with section 202(a). For example, EPA evaluated all \nof the standards (LEV III criteria pollutant, ZEV sales mandate, and \nGHG standards) of the ACC program in recognition of the aggregate \ncosts and lead time associated with CARB\u2019s standards as well as \ntechnologies that may be employed to meet more than one standard. \n78 FR 2131-45.

In EPA\u2019s view upon reconsideration \nof SAFE 1, UARG is distinguishable because here the Agency is \nacting under a specific exemption to section 202(a) that allows for \nCalifornia to set its own standards for motor vehicle GHG standards \nunder California state law, and thus, regulate major sources of GHG \nemissions within the State. California\u2019s authority to promulgate \nstandards is neither contingent nor dependent on the Agency\u2019s \nsection 202(a) endangerment finding for GHG. See 74 FR at 32778-80; \n79 FR at 46262. Moreover, as discussed above, EPA\u2019s waiver authority \nunder section 209(b) is coextensive with preemption under section \n209(a). See MEMA I, 627 F.2d at 1107.

EPA concludes it erred by not properly \nevaluating the statutory interpretation of section 209, \nthe associated legislative history including the policy \ndeference that should be afforded to California to \naddress its serious air quality problems and to serve as \na laboratory for the country, and because the \u201cneed\u201d for \na motor vehicle emission program and related standards \nwithin the program are necessarily better viewed as a \ncomprehensive and interrelated effort to address the \nrange of air quality problems facing California.286 At the \n286.\u2002  As noted previously, in the context of evaluating the \n\u201cneed\u201d for California\u2019s motor vehicle emission standards the Agency \nis informed by the legislative history from 1967 and 1977, whereby \nCalifornia is properly viewed as a laboratory for the country and \nthat its policy decisions on how best to address its serious air quality \nissues, and that deference on the question of \u201cneed\u201d is in order. \nTherefore, EPA believes it misapplied the concept of deference in \nthe context of the second waiver prong application in SAFE 1. See \ne.g., 84 FR at 51344 n.268. While EPA believes it appropriate to not \ndefer when it is interpreting its own statute, the Agency nevertheless \ndetermines that California\u2019s policy choices in term of its \u201cneed\u201d in \nhow best to address compelling and extraordinary conditions in \nCalifornia requires deference by the Agency. This is consistent \nwith EPA\u2019s longstanding waiver practice and its integration of the \nlegislative history behind section 209. In any event, EPA would reach \nthe same conclusions regarding the second waiver prong even if it \ndid not defer to California regarding the nature of its air quality \nproblems. 86 FR at 74489 (\u201cThe 2009 Endangerment Finding further \nexplained that compared with a future without climate change, \nclimate change is expected to increase tropospheric ozone pollution \nover broad areas of the U.S., including in the largest metropolitan \n\n202a\nsame time, EPA notes that the traditional interpretation \nis reasonable and consistent with the text, structure and \ncongressional intent and purpose of section 209(b) and \nEPA is thus confirming that the traditional interpretation \nof section 209(b)(1)(B) was appropriate and is, at least, the \nbetter interpretation.287 \n2.\t California Needs the GHG Standards and ZEV Sales \nMandate Even Under the SAFE 1 Interpretation\nEven if the SAFE 1 interpretation of section 209\n(b)(1)(B) was appropriate, the record of both the ACC \nprogram waiver and SAFE 1 proceeding demonstrate that \nCalifornia has a need for the GHG standards and ZEV \nsales mandate at issue under the SAFE 1 interpretation \nas well.

Again, even if a new interpretation of \nsection 209(b)(1)(B) were appropriate in SAFE 1, and EPA \nbelieves it is not, it is important to note that historically, \ncriteria pollutant reductions have been relevant to section \n209(b)(1)(B). As previously noted, nothing in section 209(b) \ncan be read as calling for EPA to waive preemption only \nif California seeks to enforce criteria pollutant standards. \nThe Administrator is required to waive the preemption \nin section 209(a) unless California \u201cdoes not need such \nState standards to meet compelling and extraordinary \nconditions.\u201d293 As also previously noted this is in stark \ncontrast to, for example, section 211(c)(4)(C), which calls for \na waiver of preemption only if a state demonstrates that \na fuel program will result in criteria pollutant reductions \nthat will enable achievement of applicable NAAQS. \nThe first section below focuses on criteria pollution \nreduction, which has long been relevant to section 209\n(b)(1)(B). EPA has never put in doubt that California\u2019s \nserious criteria air pollution problems (such as NAAQS \nnonattainment and the factors that give rise to those \nconditions, including the geographic and climate conditions \nin the State, the number of motor vehicles in California, \n293.\u2002  CAA section 209(b)(1)(B) (emphasis added). \n\n206a\nand local and regional air quality) are \u201ccompelling and \nextraordinary,\u201d or that California \u201cneeds\u201d regulations \nthat address such emissions in order to achieve every \nfraction of criteria pollutant emissions it can achieve.294 \nThe factual record before the Agency in 2013 and again \nin 2019 includes ample documentation of criteria emission \nreductions from California\u2019s GHG standards and ZEV \nsales mandate.295 Nothing in the record is sufficient to \ndemonstrate that California does not need the ACC \nprogram (or the motor vehicle emission program) or, in \nthe context of the SAFE 1 interpretation, the specific \nGHG emission standards and the ZEV sales mandate to \nmeet compelling needs related to criteria pollution. These \nbenefits have a clear connection to California\u2019s \u201cneed\u201d for \nits specific GHG standards and ZEV sales mandate, at \nissue under the waiver. The second section below focuses \non the GHG reduction benefits of California\u2019s GHG \nstandards and ZEV sales mandate. EPA acknowledges \nthat California is particularly impacted by climate change, \nincluding increasing risks from record-setting fires, \n294.\u2002  In SAFE 1, EPA found that California\u2019s criteria pollution \nconditions remain \u201ccompelling and extraordinary and that California \nneeds standards to produce any and all reductions in criteria \npollutant emissions.\u201d 84 FR at 51344, 51346. \n295.\u2002  When California originally adopted a ZEV sales mandate \ninto its regulations, a significant factor in support of its action \nwas addressing criteria pollutant emissions.

Therefore, EPA believes that to \nthe degree a nexus between CARB\u2019s standards and addressing its \nserious air quality problems is required, that it is reasonable to base \nthe need on related criteria emission impacts. EPA notes that, in \nsetting its federal light-duty vehicle GHG standards, it is afforded \ndiscretion under the CAA to consider upstream emission impacts \nand does include such consideration in its own rulemakings. 77 FR \n62624, 62819 (October 15, 2012) (taking fuel related upstream GHG \nemissions into account in setting compliance values for vehicle GHG \nemissions standards). \n\n208a\nfor instance, that \u201cthe impacts of global climate change can \nnevertheless exacerbate this local air pollution problem.\u201d297 \nMoreover, as previously explained, in two additional GHG \nwaiver requests and associated EPA waiver decisions since \nthe 2009 GHG waiver, EPA acknowledged that CARB had \ndemonstrated the need for GHG standards to address \ncriteria pollutant concentrations in California.

The LEV III criteria pollutant fleet \nstandard is responsible for those emission reductions in \nthe fleet; the fleet would become cleaner regardless of \nthe ZEV regulation because manufacturers would adjust \ntheir compliance response to the standard by making less \npolluting conventional vehicles.\u201d304 But, as discussed above, \nthat was merely an attribution of benefits and did not \nreflect the practical reality of how California\u2019s standards \nwork. Moreover, the paragraph in its entirety goes on to \nexplain that CARB\u2019s ZEV sales mandate would achieve \ncriteria emission reductions: \u201cHowever, since upstream \ncriteria and PM emissions are not captured in the LEV \nIII criteria pollutant standard, net upstream emissions \nare reduced through the increased use of electricity and \nconcomitant reductions in fuel production.\u201d305 \n303.\u2002  84 FR at 51337. \n304.\u2002  Id. at 51337, 51330, 51337, 51353-54, 51356, 51358. \n305.\u2002  2012 Waiver Request at 15-16. CARB also noted that \ncriteria and PM emission benefits will vary by region throughout \nthe State depending on the location of emission sources.

As \nrefinery operations reduce production and emissions, the input \n\n212a\nIt bears note that this attribution of criteria pollutant \nreductions was similar to the one that CARB made \nalmost a decade ago for the 2009 GHG waiver request.306 \nFor example, CARB provided \u201cextensive evidence of \nits current and serious air quality problems and the \nincreasingly stringent health-based air quality standards \nand federally required state planning efforts to meet \nthose standards firmly.\u201d307 The States and Cities also \ncommented that \u201cthe attribution CARB made as part \nof its waiver request was never intended to, and did not, \nestablish the absence of any vehicular emission benefits \nfrom the ZEV standard.\u201d EPA believes that CARB\u2019s \nstatement was merely a \u201csimplification that distinguished \nthe standards based on the primary objectives of the \ntwo, complementary standards.\u201d308 EPA agrees that the \nand output activities, such as truck and ship deliveries, will also \ndecline.

In this context \nit is important to note that air pollution problems, including local or \nregional air pollution problems, do not occur in isolation. Ozone and \nPM air pollution, traditionally seen as local or regional air pollution \nproblems, occur in a context that to some extent can involve long \nrange transport of this air pollution or its precursors.

Therefore, marine communities along the coast \nof California are increasingly subjected to a suite of concurrent \nenvironmental stressors.

Further, evidence \nin the record from a 2019 study demonstrated that locally enhanced \ncarbon dioxide concentrations above Monterey Bay, California, \nfluctuate by time of day likely because of the magnitude of nearby \nurban carbon dioxide pollution and the effects of topography on \noffshore winds, and that this fluctuation increases the expected rate \nof acidification of the Bay. See Northcott, et al., Impacts of urban \ncarbon dioxide emissions on sea-air flux and ocean acidification \nin nearshore waters, PLoS ONE (2019). For decades, the monthly \naverage carbon dioxide concentrations off California\u2019s coast have \nbeen consistently higher and more variable than those at Mauna \nLoa (which are commonly used as the global measurements).

Ample record support exists on \nCalifornia\u2019s need for both GHG standards and ZEV sales \nmandate at issue to address compelling and extraordinary \nconditions in California. As noted above, in SAFE 1 EPA, \nhowever, relied on an excerpt of the ACC program waiver \nrecord to determine the lack of criteria emission benefits \nof GHG emission standards and ZEV sales mandate at \nissue. In doing so, EPA did not evaluate the complete \nrecord from the ACC waiver proceeding and the nature of \nCalifornia\u2019s air quality problem, including the relationship \nof climate change to California\u2019s ability to achieve the \nozone NAAQS in the assessment of California\u2019s need for \nthese requirements.337 \n336.\u2002  The Agency again notes that, unlike provisions of the CAA \nsuch as section 211(c)(4)(C) which allows EPA to waive preemption of \na state fuel program respecting a fuel characteristic or component \nthat EPA regulates through a demonstration that the state fuel \nprogram is necessary to achieve a NAAQS, section 209(b) makes \nno mention of NAAQS pollutants or otherwise indicates that air \npollutants should be treated differently. \n337.\u2002  For example, CARB\u2019s ISOR for its ZEV standards \nidentifies at Table 6.2 the well to wheel emission benefits of the \nZEV program compared to the LEV III program.

EPA believes that the \nburden of proof had not been met in SAFE 1, based on the \ncomplete factual record, to demonstrate that California \ndid not have a need for the GHG standards and ZEV sales \nmandate under the SAFE 1 interpretation of the second \nwaiver prong nor had the burden been met to support a \n339.\u2002  Ford Motor Co. v.

As noted above, the result \nof the recission of the SAFE 1 action is the reinstatement \nof the ACC program waiver. EPA confirms the traditional \ninterpretation of section 209(b)(1)(B) was appropriate \nand continues to be, at least, a better interpretation \nregardless of the recission of the SAFE 1 interpretation \nof this criterion.341 \nVI.\tEPA Inappropriately Considered Preemption Under \nthe Energy Policy and Conservation Act (EPCA) in \nIts Waiver Decision\nSAFE 1\u2019s other justification for withdrawing the ACC \nprogram waiver was that California\u2019s GHG standards \nand ZEV sales mandate were preempted under EPCA. \nAs explained in detail in Section IV, EPA believes this \nbasis for reconsideration was outside the appropriate \nbounds of EPA\u2019s authority to reconsider previously \ngranted waivers. In particular, if EPA could reconsider \nand withdraw a waiver based on a factor not contained \nin the specified criteria for denial in section 209(b)(1), \nEPA could circumvent the specified criteria for denial via \nreconsideration of previously granted waiver.\nEven if it were appropriate for EPA to reconsider a \npreviously granted waiver based on non-statutory factors, \nin this action, EPA concludes that it was inappropriate to \n341.\u2002  See 84 FR at 51344 n.269. \n\n228a\nrely on preemption under EPCA as a basis for withdrawing \ncertain aspects of the ACC program waiver. In SAFE 1, a \njoint action between NHTSA and EPA, NHTSA concluded \nthat state or local regulations of tailpipe carbon dioxide \nemissions are \u201crelated to fuel economy standards\u201d and \nare therefore preempted under EPCA.342 As a direct \nresult of NHTSA\u2019s codified text and pronouncements on \npreemption set forth in SAFE 1, EPA withdrew the ACC \nprogram waiver for California\u2019s GHG standards and ZEV \nsales mandate on grounds that they were preempted under \nEPCA. In SAFE 1, EPA believed it was appropriate to \nconsider the effect of NHTSA\u2019s actions, including the \nview that California cannot enforce standards that are \nvoid ab initio, and thus EPA stated that \u201cto the extent \nthat administrative action is necessary on EPA\u2019s part to \nreflect that state of affairs, EPA hereby withdraws that \nprior grant of a waiver on this basis.\u201d343 NHTSA has \nsince issued a new final rule that formally repeals the \n342.\u2002  49 U.S.C. 32919(a) (\u201cWhen an average fuel economy \nstandard prescribed under this chapter is in effect, a State or a \npolitical subdivision of a State may not adopt or enforce a law or \nregulation related to fuel economy standards or average fuel economy \nstandards for automobiles covered by an average fuel economy \nstandard under this chapter.\u201d). NHTSA noted that a law or regulation \nhaving the direct or substantial effect of regulating or prohibiting \ntailpipe carbon dioxide emissions from automobiles or automobile \nfuel economy is a law or regulation related to fuel economy standards \nand expressly preempted under 49 U.S.C. 32919(a). 84 FR at 51317-\n18. NHTSA\u2019s rule was codified at 49 CFR 531.7 (\u201cPreemption\u201d) and \n533.7 (\u201cPreemption\u201d), as well as each Appendix B in 49 CFR part \n531 (\u201cAPPENDIX B TO PART 531\u2014PREEMPTION\u201d) and Part 533 \n(\u201cAPPENDIX B TO PART 533\u2014PREEMPTION\u201d). \n343.\u2002  84 FR at 51338. \n\n229a\ncodified text and pronouncements regarding preemption \nunder EPCA found in SAFE 1. Upon reconsideration, \nEPA now believes that, given NHTSA\u2019s repeal of its \nregulation and pronouncements in SAFE 1, preemption \nunder EPCA cannot serve as a basis for the withdrawal of \nthe ACC program waiver as it did in SAFE 1\u2014if it could \never legitimately serve as such basis. EPA thus believes \nit is appropriate to rescind the portion of the waiver \nwithdrawal that was based on preemption under EPCA. \nIn addition, given the unique consideration of \npreemption under EPCA in SAFE 1 and its effect on an \notherwise validly issued waiver under the CAA, EPA \nbelieves it is helpful to provide additional information \nregarding the Agency\u2019s historical practice and views \nto demonstrate why consideration of preemption under \nEPCA was inappropriate. Consideration of preemption \nunder EPCA is beyond the statutorily prescribed criteria \nfor EPA in section 209(b)(1). Preemption under EPCA \nwas not a factor that California addressed under the \napplicable waiver criteria in its initial request nor was it a \nfactor that EPA considered in granting the ACC program \nwaiver. Until SAFE 1, the Agency consistently refrained \nfrom reviewing waiver requests against factors beyond \nthe statutorily listed criteria under section 209(b)(1). \nThus, EPA also believes that in the reconsideration of a \nwaiver where EPA had previously declined to consider \npreemption under EPCA, SAFE 1 was contrary to \ncongressional intent and the Agency\u2019s historic practice of \nhewing to section 209(b)(1) statutory criteria in reviewing \nwaiver requests. Given this backdrop, EPA believes that \nthe joint rulemaking context of SAFE 1 was an improper \n\n230a\nbasis to deviate from EPA\u2019s long held belief to not consider \nfactors outside the scope of section 209(b)(1), especially \ngiven that the Agency indicated it would only be a \nsingular occurrence. EPA continues to view the text and \ncongressional intent of the statute, as well as subsequent \ncase law, as best supporting a limited scope of review for \nwaiver requests under section 209(b)(1)\u2014irrespective of \nwhether a waiver proceeding is undertaken either solely \nby EPA or in unison with another agency. Therefore, based \non EPA\u2019s historical practice of not considering factors \noutside of the section 209(b)(1) criteria and because EPA \nbelieves the \u201cjoint-action\u201d premise was improper, the \nAgency is rescinding its withdrawal of the ACC program \nwaiver based on preemption under EPCA.\nA.\t Historical Practice and Legislative History\nHistorically, in reviewing California\u2019s waiver requests, \nEPA has refrained from the consideration of factors \nbeyond those criteria set out in section 209(b)(1).344 \n344.\u2002  See, e.g., 43 FR at 32184 (rejecting objections to the \nprocedures at state level, objections that section 207(c)(3)(A) \nestablishes field protection, and constitutional objections all as \nbeyond the \u201cnarrow\u201d scope of the Administrator\u2019s review); 74 FR \nat 32783 (rejecting comments asking for the consideration of EPCA \nbecause it is not one of the three statutorily prescribed criteria); 78 \nFR at 2145 (again rejecting comments asking for the consideration \nof EPCA because it is outside the statutory criteria); 79 FR at \n46265 (rejecting the argument that the HD GHG Regulations \n\u201cimpermissibly regulate fuel economy\u201d because, like the commerce \nclause and Federal Aviation Administration Authorization Act of \n1994 (FAAAA) issues, this issue is \u201coutside the proper scope of \nreview since it is not among the criteria listed under section 209(b).\u201d). \n\n231a\nEPA has generally explained that the text, structure, \nand purpose of the California waiver provision indicate \ncongressional intent for EPA to provide significant \ndeference to California\u2019s judgment, especially on \n\u201cambiguous and controversial matters of public policy.\u201d345 \nIn section 209(a), Congress generally preempted state \nstandards relating to the control of emissions from \nnew motor vehicles and engines, but, in section 209(b), \nCongress carved out an exception for California, directing \nEPA to grant California a waiver of section 209(a) unless \nthe Agency can make a finding under section 209(b). \nCongress recognized that California\u2019s \u201ccompelling \nand extraordinary circumstances,\u201d and its historical \npractice of regulating in the area, were sufficient \u201cto \njustify standards on automobile emissions which may, \nfrom time to time, need be more stringent than national \nstandards.\u201d346 In creating the waiver program, Congress \nintended not only for California to be able to meet its own \nemission reduction needs, but also for California to act \nas \u201ca kind of laboratory for innovation\u201d for motor vehicle \nstandards and control technology.\u201d347 Thus \u201cCongress \n345.\u2002  78 FR at 2112, 2115; 40 FR at 23103-04; 58 FR 4166. \n346.\u2002  H.R.

The D.C. Circuit has stated that, \nunder the text of the statute, the section 209(b) criteria \nare \u201cthe only waiver standards with which California \nmust comply\u201d and that, therefore, \u201c[i]f EPA concludes \nthat California\u2019s standards [meet section 209(b)], it is \nobligated to approve California\u2019s waiver application.\u201d353 \nThe D.C.

Comments Received\nEPA received comments in support of and against the \nconsideration of preemption under EPCA in reviewing \nrequests for waivers by California.

Some commenters agreed that the context of a \njoint action necessitated consideration of preemption under \nEPCA because NHTSA was the agency charged with \ninterpreting and implementing EPCA and so EPA must \nconsider its findings in the same action.374 One commenter \nalso argued that the joint rulemaking of SAFE 1 would be \nconsistent with pronouncements in Massachusetts v. EPA \n(2007) on the agencies\u2019 respective statutory obligations \nand the need to avoid inconsistency and so, \u201c[o]nce NHTSA \nproposed to finalize a determination that EPCA preempts \nCalifornia\u2019s GHG motor vehicle standards, it would be \nunreasonable for the EPA to refuse to take NHTSA\u2019s \naction into account.\u201d375 \nOther commenters argued that the context of the \nrulemaking, whether joint or not, was irrelevant. One \ncommenter stated emphatically that \u201cwhat Congress \ndirected EPA to consider when it wrote Section 209(b)(1) \ndoes not change depending on whether EPA acts alone or \nwith another agency.\u201d376 Some commenters also argued \nthat the context of the rulemaking was a particularly \ninsufficient justification for revoking the waiver given \nlanguage in SAFE 1 that allowed for inconsistent \nconsideration of EPCA preemption. Several commenters \nnoted that EPA constrained the future applicability of \nSAFE 1 by explaining that the Agency would not consider \nfactors outside statutory criteria in future waiver reviews \n374.\u2002  See, e.g., CEI at 11-12; AFPM at 2, 6. \n375.\u2002  CEI at 11. \n376.\u2002  States and Cities at 20.

Commenters argued that EPA\u2019s \nauthority to look outside the statutory criteria at EPCA \nwas at least permissive, if not mandatory. According to \none commenter, \u201cEPA exaggerates the Court\u2019s position\u201d \nin MEMA I in its Reconsideration notice: \u201c[T]he court did \nnot say that the EPA is forbidden to take constitutional \nramifications into consideration, only that it is not required \nto do so.\u201d379 Another commenter agreed that MEMA I \nand MEMA II \u201cdo not preclude EPA from considering\u201d \npreemption under EPCA but then went further, saying \nthat \u201cEPA is required to consider EPCA preemption.\u201d380 \nThe commenter argued that MEMA I rejected petitioners\u2019 \nconstitutional objections to a waiver under an institutional \n377.\u2002  NESCAUM at 3; Twelve Public Interest Organizations \nat app. 1 64-65; States and Cities at 20. \n378.\u2002  SCAQMD at 7 (quoting 86 FR at 22439, n.40). \n379.\u2002  CEI at 10 (original emphasis). \n380.\u2002  AFPM at 5-6. \n\n241a\ncompetence line of reasoning, concluding that \u201c[t]he \nwaiver proceeding produces a forum ill-suited to the \nresolution of constitutional claims.\u201d381 In contrast, they \ncontinued, the waiver proceeding is an appropriate forum \nfor determining whether emission standards \u201crelate to\u201d \nfuel economy because this issue is \u201cwithin the agency\u2019s \ncompetence, as this relationship is mathematical and based \nin science rather than understandings of Constitutional \nlaw and precedent.\u201d382 However, the other commenter, \nwho agreed that EPA is not \u201cforbidden\u201d from considering \npreemption under EPCA, also noted that EPA \u201chas no \nspecial competence to interpret EPCA.\u201d383 \nSeveral commenters also argued that EPA could not \nreinstate the waiver because NHTSA concluded that \nEPCA preempts the standards, such standards were void \nab initio, and therefore \u201cthe state mandates referenced \nin CA\u2019s petition for reconsideration are not even eligible \nto be considered for a CAA waiver of preemption.\u201d384 To \n381.\u2002  Id. at 6 (quoting MEMA I, 627 F.2d 1095, 1114-15 (DC \nCir. 1979)). \n382.\u2002  Id. \n383.\u2002  CEI at 11. \n384.\u2002  NADA at 3-4; See also AFPM at 3 (\u201cSince California\u2019s \nGHG tailpipe standards and ZEV mandate are related to fuel \neconomy, they are not lawfully adopted and void ab initio \u2014and \nthere is nothing for EPA to reinstate.\u201d); Urban Air at 47-48; CEI at \n2 (\u201cBut EPCA preemption is the proverbial elephant in the room. \nIf SAFE 1\u2019s EPCA preemption argument is correct, the EPA could \nnot grant a valid CAA preemption waiver for California\u2019s tailpipe \nCO 2 standards and ZEV mandates, because EPCA had already \n\n242a\nignore this, they claimed, would violate the Supremacy \nClause of the Constitution.

Furthermore, given the context of EPA\u2019s \nreconsideration of the ACC program waiver at the time \nof SAFE 1, the Agency believes it was inappropriate to \nreconsider the validity of the waiver against criteria such \nas preemption under EPCA. In this action, based on the \ntwo independent grounds noted above, the Agency is \nrescinding the portion of SAFE 1 that withdrew the ACC \nprogram waiver based on preemption under EPCA. \n1.\t NHTSA Has Since Repealed Its Findings of \nPreemption Made in SAFE 1\nIn the Notice of Reconsideration, EPA sought comment \non the Agency\u2019s reliance on NHTSA\u2019s preemption findings \nas a basis for its withdrawal of the ACC program waiver \nin SAFE 1.

Specifically, NHTSA has issued a new final \nrule that formally repeals the codified text and additional \npronouncements regarding preemption under EPCA \nfound in SAFE 1.394 In SAFE 1, EPA stated that it was \nappropriate to consider the effect of NHTSA\u2019s actions, \nincluding the view that California cannot enforce \nstandards that are void ab initio and thus EPA stated \nthat \u201cto the extent that administrative action is necessary \non EPA\u2019s part to reflect that state of affairs, EPA hereby \nwithdraws that prior grant of a waiver on this basis.\u201d395 \nSince this condition no longer exists, EPA believes it is \nappropriate to rescind the waiver withdrawal that was \n393.\u2002  86 FR at 22429. \n394.\u2002  86 FR 74236. NHTSA notes in this rulemaking that \u201cthe \nAgency is repealing all regulatory text and appendices promulgated \nin the SAFE I Rule. In doing so, the Agency underscores that any \npositions announced in preambulatory statements of prior NHTSA \nrulemakings, including in the SAFE I Rule, which purported \nto define the scope of preemption under the Energy Policy and \nConservation Act (EPCA), do not reflect the Agency\u2019s reconsidered \nunderstanding of its proper role in matters of EPCA preemption.\u201d \n395.\u2002  EPA distinguished these previous single-agency actions \nfrom its joint action context by explaining that ignoring NHTSA\u2019s \ndetermination of preemption in the same action, \u201cwould place the \nUnited States Government in the untenable position of arguing that \none federal agency can resurrect a State provision that, as another \nfederal agency has concluded and codified, Congress has expressly \npreempted and therefore rendered void ab initio.\u201d 84 FR at 51338. \n\n246a\nbased on preemption under EPCA. EPA believes that, \nto the extent it was ever appropriate for the Agency to \nbase its action on NHTSA\u2019s finding of preemption under \nEPCA in SAFE 1, the repeal of the preemption rule makes \nit likewise appropriate to rescind the Agency\u2019s action \nin SAFE 1. This would also act to minimize regulatory \nuncertainty as to do otherwise would create further \nconfusion that resulted from the joint action in SAFE \n1 and would not appropriately reflect the current state \nof affairs under the circumstances of a unique federal \nregulation that had otherwise motivated EPA\u2019s actions \nin SAFE 1. NHTSA\u2019s recent action also supports EPA\u2019s \nbelief that its practice of limiting its review of section \n209(b) criteria, as explained below, remains appropriate \nin the context of preemption under EPCA. \n2.\t EPA Improperly Deviated From Its Historical \nPractice of Limiting Its Review to Section 209(b) \nCriteria\nSection 209(b)(1) of the Act limits the Agency\u2019s \nauthority to deny California\u2019s requests for waivers to \nthe three criteria contained therein and the Agency \nhas consistently refrained from reviewing California\u2019s \nrequests for waivers based on any other criteria. EPA \nacknowledges that California adopts its standards as \na matter of law under its state police powers, that the \nAgency\u2019s task in reviewing waiver requests is limited to \nevaluating California\u2019s request according to the criteria \nin section 209(b), and that it is appropriate to defer to \nlitigation brought by third parties in other courts, such \nas state or federal district court, for the resolution of any \n\n247a\nconstitutionality claims and assertions of inconsistency \nwith other statutes. Considering the lack of statutory and \nprecedential support as shown below, even if EPA were \nto have discretion to consider criteria outside section \n209(b), EPA now views the joint-action context of SAFE \n1 as an insufficient justification for deviating from its \nstatutory authority and the Agency\u2019s historical practice \nand therefore the Agency rescinds its actions regarding \npreemption under EPCA in SAFE 1. \nWithdrawal of the waiver was premised on NHTSA\u2019s \npreemption regulations in what EPA explained was a \njoint rulemaking action. But nothing in section 209(b) \ncan be read as calling for consideration of preemption \nunder EPCA in evaluating waiver requests regardless of \nwhether EPA engaged in joint rulemaking with another \nagency or acted alone. Specifically, under section 209(b), \nEPA must grant California a waiver of the preemption \ncontained in section 209(a) unless the Administrator \nmakes a finding under any one of the listed criteria: \n\u201cThe Administrator shall . . . waive application of the \npreemption in section 209(a) if the Administrator finds \nany of the following: \u2018(A) [California\u2019s] determination \n[that its standards in the aggregate will be at least as \nprotective] is arbitrary and capricious, (B) [California] \ndoes not need such State standards to meet compelling and \nextraordinary conditions, or (C) such State standards and \naccompanying enforcement procedures are not consistent \nwith section [202(a)].\u2019\u201d396 Evaluation of preemption under \nEPCA is not a listed criterion. \n396.\u2002  CAA section 209(b)(1)(A)-(C). \n\n248a\nNor did SAFE 1 premise preemption under EPCA on \nany of the three statutory criteria. In the ACC program \nwaiver request, CARB made a protectiveness finding \nthat, as a quantitative matter, its standards, in the \naggregate, were as protective as the Federal standards \nand did not address preemption under EPCA.397 In \nfact, while California might opt to respond to comments \non preemption under EPCA, California would not be \nexpected to take it into account in any protectiveness \nfinding made for a waiver request. It bears note that \nCalifornia\u2019s practice is not unusual because there are \nother factors and provisions of the CAA that California \ndoes not account for in making its protectiveness finding \nunder section 209(b)(1).398 In granting the ACC program \nwaiver request, EPA found that California\u2019s protectiveness \nfinding was neither arbitrary nor capricious.399 EPA \nalso responded to comments on the consideration of \npreemption under EPCA in granting the waiver but \ndismissed such objections as outside the scope of its \nreview.400 Historically, EPA draws a comparison between \nthe numerical stringency of California and federal \nstandards in making the requisite finding as to whether \nCalifornia\u2019s protectiveness determination is arbitrary and \n397.\u2002  2012 Waiver Request at 15-17. \n398.\u2002  For example, \u201cCalifornia is not required to comply with \nsection 207 to get a waiver.\u201d MEMA II, 142 F.3d 449, 467 (D.C. Cir. \n1989). \n399.\u2002  78 FR at 2125. \n400.\u2002  Id. at 2145. \n\n249a\ncapricious.401 Thus, neither California\u2019s initial request, \nnor EPA\u2019s waiver grant, considered preemption under \nEPCA and as previously explained in the ACC program \nwaiver, EPA declined to consider preemption under EPCA \nviewing it as outside the scope of Agency review. \nSAFE 1 made clear that consideration of and reliance \non preemption under EPCA was the consequence of \nregulations promulgated by NHTSA. As SAFE 1 also \nacknowledged, however, EPA does not \u201cadminister\u201d \nEPCA; that task falls to NHTSA.402 Instead, \u201c[i]f EPA \nconcludes that California\u2019s standards [meet section \n209(b)], it is obligated to approve California\u2019s waiver \napplication.\u201d403 EPA therefore disagrees with the comment \nthat Massachusetts provides the Agency special duty to \nconsider preemption under EPCA in a joint rulemaking \naction in reviewing waiver requests. In Massachusetts, \nthe Supreme Court recognized the potential overlap \n401.\u2002   Section 209(b)(2) provides that if each State [California] \nstandard is at least as stringent as comparable applicable Federal \nstandards then such standard shall be deemed to be as protective \nof public health and welfare as such federal standards for purposes \nof section 209(b)(1)(A). EPA acknowledges that in 1977 Congress \namended the waiver provision to allow for California to address its \nunique combination of air quality problems and that California only \nbe required to demonstrate stringency in the aggregate and that \ntherefore some pollutant standards may not be as stringent. \n402.\u2002  84 FR at 51338 (\u201cEPA agrees with commenters that EPA \nis not the agency that Congress has tasked with administering \nand interpreting EPCA. This is especially so because \u2018[t]he \nwaiver proceeding produces a forum ill-suited to the resolution of \nconstitutional claims.\u2019 MEMA I, 627 F.2d at 1115.\u201d). \n403.\u2002  MEMA II, 142 F.3d at 463. \n\n250a\nbetween NHTSA\u2019s and EPA\u2019s statutory obligations and \nconcluded that \u201cthere is no reason to think the two \nagencies cannot both administer their obligations yet \navoid inconsistency.\u201d404 As one commenter noted, EPA \nand NHTSA have previously engaged in joint actions \nthat addressed fuel economy and GHG emissions. In \nthose actions, NHTSA\u2019s role has been to set national fuel \neconomy standards and EPA\u2019s role has been to set national \nGHG standards.405 These roles are complementary, but \ndistinct. The Court acknowledged the independence of \nthese roles in Massachusetts: \u201cEPA has been charged with \nprotecting the public\u2019s \u2018health\u2019 and \u2018welfare,\u2019 42 U.S.C. \n7521(a)(1), a statutory obligation wholly independent of \nDOT\u2019s mandate to promote energy efficiency.

Again, the result of this unique \napplication of EPA\u2019s authority is unsupported under \nsection 209(b)(1). \nAs previously noted, EPCA is generally administered \nby NHTSA and consideration of preemption under EPCA \nin reviewing waiver requests would for instance call for \nEPA to resolve the much debated and differing views as \nto what is a \u201claw or regulation related to fuel economy,\u201d \nas contemplated by 39 U.S.C. 32919(a).408 Relevant judicial \nprecedent would also appear to call into question whether \nCalifornia\u2019s GHG standards and ZEV sales mandates \nare indeed preempted under EPCA.409 But as previously \nexplained, EPA does not implement EPCA, and the \nAgency\u2019s review of waiver requests is highly deferential. \nEPA also disagrees with comments that the Agency \nmust generally consider factors outside the criteria listed \nin section 209(b), including preemption under EPCA, \nregardless of the joint- or single-agency nature of the \naction. EPA has never claimed that it has such broad \nauthority to consider factors outside section 209(b) and the \n408.\u2002  EPA takes no position on any role NHTSA might play \nunder 42 U.S.C. 32919(a) and acknowledges that NHTSA discusses \nthis in its recent final rulemaking.

For example, in MEMA I, the D.C. Circuit \nstated that \u201cthere is no such thing as a \u201cgeneral duty\u201d \non an administrative agency to make decisions based on \nfactors other than those Congress expressly or impliedly \nintended the agency to consider.\u201d412 In MEMA II, the D.C. \nCircuit again rejected consideration of a factor outside the \n209(b) statutory criteria because doing so would restrict \nCalifornia\u2019s ability to \u201cexercise broad discretion.\u201d413 \n410.\u2002  MEMA I, 627 F.2d 1095, 1119 (D.C. Cir. 1979). \n411.\u2002  See, e.g., 43 FR at 32184 (rejecting objections to the \nprocedures at state level, objections that section 207(c)(3)(A) \nestablishes field protection, and constitutional objections all as \nbeyond the \u201cnarrow\u201d scope of the Administrator\u2019s review); 74 FR at \n32783 (declining to consider EPCA preemption, stating that \u201csection \n209(b) of the Clean Air Act limits our authority to deny California\u2019s \nrequests for waivers to the three criteria therein.\u201d); 79 FR at 46264 \n(reiterating that EPA can only deny a waiver request based on \nthe 209(b) statutory criteria, dismissing comments on preemption \nunder EPCA, as well as the Constitution and the implications of the \nFAAAA). \n412.\u2002  627 F.2d at 1116. \n413.\u2002  142 F.3d at 464. \n\n253a\nCommenters also claim that ignoring NHTSA\u2019s \nfinding of preemption would violate the Supremacy Clause \nof the Constitution because the necessary consequence of \nNHTSA\u2019s conclusion in SAFE 1 is that certain standards \nwere void ab initio as preempted under EPCA and as such \nthat \u201cthe state mandates referenced in [California\u2019s] petition \nfor reconsideration are not even eligible to be considered \nfor a CAA waiver of preemption.\u201d414 EPA disagrees. As \nthe D.C. Circuit has held, \u201c[t]hat [the Administrator] like \nevery other administrative officer owes allegiance to the \nConstitution does not mean that he is required to issue \nrulings of constitutional dimension.\u201d415 Thus, \u201c[n]othing in \nsection 209 requires [the Administrator] to consider the \nconstitutional ramifications of the regulations for which \nCalifornia requests a waiver.\u201d416 \nMoreover, consideration of factors beyond those set \nout in section 209(b)(1) would subject California and vehicle \nand engine manufacturers to changes in regulatory \nschemes by other federal agencies not acting under the \nauthority of the CAA.417 SAFE 1 and subsequent events \n414.\u2002  NADA at 3. \n415.\u2002  MEMA I, 627 F.2d at 1114-15. \n416.\u2002  Id. at 1115. \n417.\u2002  \u201cThe manufacture of automobiles is a complex matter, \nrequiring decisions to be made far in advance of their actual \nexecution.

Rep. No. 403, 90th Cong., \nat 730 1st Sess. (1967). \n\n254a\nperfectly encapsulate this problem. For instance, NHTSA \nhas since finalized the repeal of the regulatory provisions \nand pronouncements it made in SAFE 1 that were the \nunderpinnings for EPA withdrawing certain aspects of the \nACC program waiver and with that action the Agency\u2019s \nbasis for revocation of the waiver under EPCA has now \nevanesced.418 Additionally, this is affirmation of EPA\u2019s long \nheld view that waiver proceedings are not the appropriate \nvenue for resolving these issues, and the joint-rulemaking \ncontext is not and should never have been justification \nfor deviating from statutory authority and the Agency\u2019s \nhistorical practice. \nIt also bears note that consideration of factors beyond \nthe criteria contained in section 209(b) would not be limited \nto preemption under EPCA. Commenters suggested, \nfor instance, that EPA would not be able to \u201cignore the \nFirst Amendment,\u201d in the hypothetical situation where \nCalifornia impos[ed] standards on some manufacturers \nin retaliation for their voiced opposition to California\u2019s \nauthority as well as criminality such as \u201cbribery and \nextortion had been instrumental in assembling the \nlegislative majorities.\u201d419 In short, under the commenter\u2019s \nview, factors for consideration in waiver proceedings would \nbe innumerable. And yet these factors bear little or no \nrelation to specific criteria in section 209(b) that would \notherwise warrant the denial of a waiver request. The D.C. \nCircuit has already, several times, held that EPA is not \nrequired to consider factors outside of and unconnected \n418.\u2002  See 86 FR 74236. \n419.\u2002  CEI at 11. \n\n255a\nto these statutory criteria, especially constitutional \nobjections. In fact, regarding the commenter\u2019s example, \nthe court has already specifically rejected consideration of \nthe First Amendment in waiver evaluations. In MEMA I, \nthe court considered and upheld EPA\u2019s decision declining \nto consider a First Amendment objection to a waiver as \nbeyond the scope of agency review.420 Courts have also \nrejected objections based on the applicability of CAA \nsection 207 to California waiver requests421 and the \nCommerce Clause.422 EPA is therefore not persuaded \nby these arguments. Additionally, courts have long held \nthat administrative proceedings for California waiver \nrequests are ill-suited for consideration of constitutional \nissues. Nothing precludes commenters from challenging \nCalifornia\u2019s standards themselves\u2014whether under EPCA, \nanother statute, or the Constitution\u2014in other, better-\nsuited fora. According to the D.C. Circuit, for instance, \n[w]hile nothing in section 209 categorically forbids the \nAdministrator from listening to constitutionality-based \nchallenges, petitioners are assured through a petition of \nreview . . . that their contentions will get a hearing.\u201d423 The \nD.C. Circuit has also repeatedly stated that challenges \n420.\u2002  MEMA I, 627 F.2d 1095, 1115 (D.C. Cir. 1979). \n421.\u2002  MEMA II, 142 F.3d 449, 467 (D.C. Cir. 1998). \n422.\u2002  ATA v.

Cir. 2015) (rejecting a challenge for lack of jurisdiction \nbecause challengers objected to California\u2019s regulations themselves, \nnot EPA\u2019s approval of them in a waiver under 209(b)). \n423.\u2002  MEMA I, 627 F.2d at 1115. \n\n256a\nwhich go to the legality of California\u2019s standards \nthemselves, are better addressed directly by either \ncourts or Congress.424 Challenges based on preemption \nunder EPCA similarly go to the legality of California\u2019s \nstandards themselves and are thus more appropriate in \ncourt or addressed to Congress. \nE.\t Conclusion\nBecause the landscape of federal law has changed \nsince SAFE 1 due to NHTSA\u2019s repeal of its regulatory \ntext, appendix, and pronouncements regarding EPCA \npreemption in SAFE 1, EPA believes that it is appropriate \nto rescind its waiver withdrawal actions in SAFE 1 that \nwere predicated on the federal law context created by \nNHTSA\u2019s SAFE 1 action. On separate grounds, EPA also \nbelieves that, based on the foregoing, EPA should not have \ndeviated from its practice of limiting its waiver review \nto the criteria in section 209(b)(1). Thus, for the reasons \nstated above, EPA is rescinding those portions of SAFE \n1 that withdrew the waiver of the ACC program on the \nbasis of preemption under EPCA. \n424.\u2002  Id. at 1105. In ATA v. EPA, the D.C. Circuit rejected \na constitutional challenge to a California waiver, concluding that \nCongress made the decision to give California \u201cthe primary role \nin regulating certain mobile pollution sources\u201d so the challenger\u2019s \nargument was best directed to Congress. 600 F.3d 624, 628 (D.C. \nCir. 2010). \n\n257a\nVII.\tEPA Inappropriately Set Forth an Interpretive \nView of Section 177 in SAFE 1\nIn SAFE 1, EPA provided an interpretive view of \nsection 177 of the CAA, stating that states adopting \nCalifornia\u2019s new motor vehicle emission standards \n(section 177 states) could not adopt California\u2019s GHG \nstandards.425 In this action, EPA determines that it was \nboth inappropriate and unnecessary within a waiver \nproceeding to provide an interpretive view of the authority \nof section 177 states to adopt California standards, as EPA \nplays no statutory approval role in connection with states\u2019 \nadoption of standards identical to those standards for \nwhich a waiver has been granted to California.426 Rather, \nif a state chooses to submit such standards for inclusion \nin an SIP, EPA\u2019s role with regard to approval of these \nstandards is to review them in the same way that EPA \nreviews all SIP revisions a state submits, via a notice and \ncomment process, to ensure that the submission meets \nall statutory and regulatory requirements as part of \nthe Agency\u2019s decision whether to approve or disapprove \nthe submission. Therefore, the Agency is rescinding the \ninterpretive views on section 177 set out in SAFE 1. \n425.\u2002  84 FR at 51310, 51350. \n426.\u2002  EPA is aware of instances of States adopting California \nnew motor vehicle emission standards and not subsequently including \nsuch standards in their SIP. In these circumstances EPA has not \nplayed and would not play an approval role. \n\n258a\nA.\t SAFE 1 Interpretation\nIn the SAFE proposal, EPA proposed to conclude that \n\u201cStates may not adopt California\u2019s GHG standards pursuant \nto section 177 because the text, context, and purpose of \nsection 177 support the conclusion that this provision \nis limited to providing States the ability, under certain \ncircumstances and with certain conditions, to adopt and \nenforce standards designed to control criteria pollutants \nto address NAAQS nonattainment.\u201d427 Additionally, the \nproposal noted the title of section 177 (\u201cNew motor vehicle \nemission standards in nonattainment areas\u201d) indicates a \nlimited scope of application.428 The proposal also suggested \nthat, because \u201c[a]reas are only designated nonattainment \nwith respect to criteria pollutants,\u201d it would be \u201cillogical\u201d \nif states could use their 177 authority \u201cto adopt California \nstandards that addressed environmental problems other \nthan nonattainment of criteria pollutant standards.\u201d429 \nIn the SAFE 1 decision, EPA finalized its proposed \ninterpretive view, reiterating that \u201cthe text (including \nboth the title and main text), structural location, and \npurpose of the provision confirm that it does not apply to \nGHG standards.\u201d430 Because section 177\u2019s title references \nnonattainment areas, and because nonattainment \ndesignations only exist for criteria pollutants, EPA \n427.\u2002  83 FR at 43240. \n428.\u2002  Id. \n429.\u2002  Id. \n430.\u2002  84 FR at 51350. \n\n259a\nclaimed, states could not adopt standards for purposes \nof GHG control under section 177.431 \nAs evidence for this interpretive view, EPA again \npointed to the text and location of the section, which \nhad been the basis for the Agency\u2019s interpretation in the \nSAFE proposal. EPA acknowledged commenters who \nargued that \u201cCAA section 177 does not contain any text \nthat could be read as limiting its applicability to certain \npollutants only\u201d and that EPA had \u201cinappropriately relied \non the heading for CAA section 177 to construe a statutory \nprovision as well as arrogated authority to implement an \notherwise self-implementing provision,\u201d but disagreed \nwith these commenters.432 In addition to the evidence \nrelied on in the proposal, EPA provided examples of \nlegislative history from the 1977 amendments to support \nits interpretive view.433 \n431.\u2002  Id. \n432.\u2002  Id. \n433.\u2002  In particular, EPA cited legislative history on section \n172(b), which set forth the \u201crequisite provisions\u201d for state plans for \nnonattainment areas. Id. at 51350 n.286. According to the legislative \nhistory, one of the many factors that must be considered by a state \nplan is \u201cactual emissions of such pollutant resulting from in-use motor \nvehicles.\u201d Id.

Supporters of SAFE 1 reiterated the reasoning \nfrom the proposal and final action.440 For example, one \ncommenter wrote, \u201cIn short, \u2018the text, context, and \npurpose of Section 177 suggest\u2019 that the provision is \nlimited to motor vehicle standards \u2018designed to control \ncriteria pollutants to address NAAQS nonattainment.\u2019\u201d441 \nLike the SAFE proposal and final action, the commenter \nstated that in addition to the text and context of the \n437.\u2002  See States and Cities\u2019 Petition at 27. \n438.\u2002  Id.

In these circumstances EPA has not \nplayed and would not play an approval role. \n451.\u2002  EPA notes that although section 177 states that \u201c. . . any \nState which has plan provisions approved under this part may adopt \nand enforce for any model year standards relating to control of \nemissions from new motor vehicles . . .\u201d the language in section 177 \ndoes not require a state to submit its adopted motor vehicle emissions \nstandards for SIP approval. \n\n266a\n177 in the context of that action.

EPA\u2019s interpretive view \nwas not compelled by any petition, request, or legislative \nor judicial mandate and was otherwise not final agency \naction.452 EPA is therefore rescinding the interpretive \nviews contained in SAFE 1. \nAs commenters have noted, section 177 does not \ndescribe a direct approval role for EPA. Section 177 says \nthat \u201cany State which has plan provisions approved under \nthis part may adopt and enforce\u201d identical California \nstandards and delineates three specific criteria for \nadoption.453 Nothing in this language or in the text of the \nrest of the section requires or allows EPA to approve such \nadoption and enforcement or directs EPA to implement \nthe section through regulation; EPA plays no statutory \napproval role in the adoption of California standards by \nother states other than action on a SIP revision, should \nthose states include the standards in their plans. In \nfact, there are only three prerequisites to adoption and \nenforcement by a state: That the state has a federally \napproved SIP, that the standards are identical (thus the \n452.\u2002  84 FR at 51338 n.256 (\u201cEPA acknowledges that its \nactions in this document may have implications for certain prior and \npotential future EPA reviews of and actions on state SIPs. . . .

Therefore, EPA \nwithdraws its interpretive views that had been set forth \nin SAFE 1.\nVIII.\t Other Issues\nA.\t Equal Sovereignty\nAs explained in Section VI, EPA must grant \nCalifornia\u2019s waiver request unless the Agency makes \none of the specified findings in section 209(b)(1). In this \n459.\u2002  The Agency has considered whether there may be any \nreliance interests on EPA\u2019s previous interpretive view of section \n177 described in the SAFE 1 action. EPA is unaware of any such \ninterests, and none were raised in comments. \n460.\u2002  To the extent that EPA\u2019s reasoning in its SAFE 1 section \n177 determination lacked fair notice, as the States and Cities\u2019 Petition \nclaimed, such a contention is rendered moot by this action. \n\n270a\ninstance, Congress has made multiple determinations \nthrough its adoption of section 209 and subsequent \namendments, dating from 1967 through the 1990 CAA \nAmendments, regarding California\u2019s role and its relation \nto federal standard setting for mobile sources. EPA\u2019s \nlongstanding waiver practice, consistent with case law, \nhas been to refrain from considering factors beyond \nsection 209(b)(1) criteria as well as constitutional claims \nin the review of California waiver requests.461 EPA \nacknowledges that California adopts its standards \nas a matter of law under its police powers,462 that the \nAgency\u2019s task in reviewing waiver requests is properly \nlimited to evaluating California\u2019s request according to \n461.\u2002  EPA has declined to consider constitutional challenges to \nCalifornia Waivers since at least 1976. 41 FR 44212 (Oct. 7, 1976) (\u201cAn \nadditional argument against granting the waiver was raised by the \nMotorcycle Industry Council and Yamaha, who contended that the \nCARB had violated due process when adopting their standards, by \nnot allowing the manufacturers a fair and full opportunity to present \ntheir views at a State hearing. If this argument has any validity, \nthe EPA waiver hearing is not the proper forum in which to raise it. \nSection 209(b) does not require that EPA insist on any particular \nprocedures at the State level. Furthermore, a complete opportunity \nwas provided at the EPA waiver hearing for the presentation of \nviews.\u201d).

As further explained this practice flows \nfrom the statute and legislative history, which reflect a \nbroad policy deference that is afforded to California to \naddress its serious air quality problems (which are on-\ngoing) as well as to drive emission control innovation. And \nso, EPA has historically declined to consider constitutional \nissues in evaluating and granting section 209 waivers. In \nMEMA I, the D.C. Circuit rejected a First Amendment \nchallenge to a waiver as outside the scope of review.463 In \n2009, EPA approved a waiver (and authorization) under \nsection 209(e), granting California authority to enforce \nits Airborne Toxic Control Measure, which established \nin-use emission performance standards for engines in \ntransport refrigeration units (TRUs) and TRU generator \nsets.464 Responding to comments that the waiver reached \nbeyond California\u2019s borders in violation of the Dormant \nCommerce Clause, EPA stated that such considerations \nare not factors that EPA must consider under section \n209(e) because \u201cEPA\u2019s review of California\u2019s regulations \nis limited to the criteria that Congress directed EPA to \nreview.\u201d465 This interpretation was upheld by the D.C. \nCircuit Court of Appeals.

As in the 2013 ACC program \nwaiver, the decision on whether to grant the waiver and the \nconsequence of a reinstated waiver is based solely on the \ncriteria in section 209(b) and this decision does not attempt \nto interpret or apply the Equal Sovereignty Doctrine or \nany other constitutional or statutory provision.\nB.\t CARB\u2019s Deemed-To-Comply Provision\nEPA received comments arguing that California\u2019s 2018 \nclarification to its deemed-to-comply provision \u201cchanged \nimportant underlying requirements of the original 2012 \nwaiver application\u201d and \u201cEPA cannot reinstate a Clean Air \nAct waiver for a program that no longer exists.\u201d475 These \ncommenters maintain that California has never sought a \nwaiver for the 2018 amendments or a determination that \nthe change is within the scope of the prior waiver. As \nsuch, commenters maintain that EPA lacks a necessary \npredicate to permit California\u2019s enforcement of its \namended GHG standards. \nOther commenters argued that the \u201cdeemed to comply\u201d \nprovision was always conditioned on the federal standards \n475.\u2002  AFPM at 7; Urban Air at 2, 18-19; NADA at 6. \n\n277a\nproviding GHG reductions that were at least equal to or \nas protective as California\u2019s program and so the 2018 \namendments did not substantively change the provision \nor affect any related reliance interests and instead were \ndesigned to clarify the provision.476 Commenters maintain \nthat CARB adopted \u201cnon-substantive amendments for its \nLEV III regulations to further clarify that the deemed-\nto-comply provision would only apply if the federal GHG \nstandards remained substantially as they were as of the \ndate of the 2017 Final Determination.\u201d477 According to \nthese commenters, California adopted these amendments \nafter EPA\u2019s withdrawal of its 2017 Final Determination \nthat had determined that its Federal GHG standards for \nmodel years 2022-2025 remained appropriate and instead \nconcluded that the federal standards for model years \n2022-2025 may be too stringent and should be revised. \nEPA notes that after the January 2017 MTE CARB \nsubsequently found that compliance with those federal \nstandards would result in equivalent or greater GHG \nbenefits than originally projected for California.478 These \ncommenters further maintain that the clarification of the \n476.\u2002  States and Cities at 58-61.

As such, the commenters \nmaintain that the clarification of the deemed-to-comply \nprovision has no bearing on and does not preclude EPA\u2019s \nSAFE 1 waiver withdrawal.479 \nAs previously explained, under section 209(b)(1) EPA \nis to grant a waiver of preemption for California to enforce \nits own standards that would otherwise be preempted \nunder section 209(a). This preemption does not extend to \nfederal standards that are adopted under section 202(a). \nEPA explained this in responding to comments on the \ndeemed-to-comply provision in the ACC program waiver \ndecision. \u201c[T]he waiver decision affects only California\u2019s \nemission standards, not the federal standards that exist \nregardless of EPA\u2019s decision.\u201d480 This preemptive effect \nof section 209(a) does not change even when California \nchooses to allow for compliance with its standards through \nfederal standards as envisaged by the deemed-to-comply \nprovision. \nIt also bears note that in SAFE 1, EPA made clear \nthat the 2018 amendment was not a \u201cnecessary part of \nthe basis for the waiver withdrawal and other actions that \n479.\u2002  States and Cities at 60-62. \n480.\u2002  78 FR at 2124. \n\n279a\nEPA finalizes in this [SAFE1] document.481 In the Notice of \nReconsideration, EPA neither reopened nor reconsidered \nelements of the 2013 waiver that were not part of EPA\u2019s \nfindings in SAFE 1.482 As noted in this decision, EPA \nhas evaluated the factual and legal errors that occurred \nin SAFE 1. As part of this evaluation, EPA believes it \nhas considered all appropriate and relevant information \nnecessary to its review of issues associated with the \nsecond waiver prong or consideration of preemption \nunder EPCA. The Agency also recognizes that it received \ncomments from parties that raised non-germane issues to \nEPA\u2019s Notice of Reconsideration. EPA did not conduct an \nanalysis of such comments in the context of reconsidering \nthe specific actions taken in SAFE 1. EPA also makes \nclear that the result of rescinding its part of SAFE 1 is \n481.\u2002  EPA declined to \u201ctake any position at this point on what \neffect California\u2019s December 2018 amendment to its \u201cdeemed to \ncomply\u2019 provision . . .

EPA also notes that \nit has previously responded twice to the comments suggesting that \nCARB\u2019s deemed-to-comply provision demonstrates that California \ndoes not have a need for its own standards.

That is the result \nof the action taken herein.483\nIX.\tDecision\nAfter review of the information submitted by CARB \nand other public commenters, the SAFE 1 action, and the \nrecord pertaining to EPA\u2019s 2013 ACC program waiver, I \nfind that EPA did not appropriately exercise its limited \ninherent authority to reconsider waiver grants in SAFE \n1. SAFE 1 did not correct a clerical or factual error, nor \ndid the factual circumstances and conditions related to the \nthree statutory criteria change prior to SAFE 1, much \nless change so significantly as to cast the propriety of the \nwaiver grant into doubt. On this basis, I am rescinding \nthe SAFE 1 action.\n483.\u2002  EPA acknowledges that motor vehicle emission standards \nin California as well as federally are periodically clarified, amended, \nor revised. For example, after California issued its first deemed-to-\ncomply regulation, EPA determined that the state\u2019s GHG standards \nwere within the scope of the 2009 waiver. While EPA believes that \nCongress intended regulatory certainty to be attached to the \nAgency\u2019s waivers issued under section 209, EPA acknowledges that \nconditions may change over time so significantly that it could merit a \nreview of California\u2019s motor vehicle emission program and applicable \nstandards therein or that would prompt California to submit a \nrelated waiver request to EPA. As explained in this decision, the \nconditions associated with the analysis of the three waiver criteria \nperformed in the ACC waiver decision did not change so as to merit \nthe SAFE 1 action. EPA recognizes that federal light-duty vehicle \nGHG emission standards have been modified twice since SAFE 1 \nwas issued; the current standards do not change EPA\u2019s conclusion \nthat SAFE 1 should be rescinded. \n\n281a\nFurthermore, after review of both the 2013 ACC \nprogram waiver record as well as the SAFE 1 record, \nto the extent that EPA did have authority to reconsider \nthe ACC program waiver, I have determined that the \nasserted bases were in error and did not justify the \nwaiver withdrawal. With respect to the Agency\u2019s first \npurported basis\u2014its discretionary decision to undertake \na reinterpretation of the second waiver prong\u2014I find \nthat the statutory interpretation adopted in SAFE 1 \nis a flawed reading of the statute, and I hereby return \nto the traditional interpretation of the second waiver \nprong, which is, at least, the better interpretation. \nUnder the traditional interpretation, which looks at the \nprogram as a whole, California clearly had a compelling \nneed for the ACC program. Even if SAFE 1\u2019s statutory \nreinterpretation, which focuses on California\u2019s compelling \nneed for the specific standards, were an appropriate \nreading, EPA did not perform a reasonable, accurate, \nand complete review of the factual record in its findings \nregarding the criteria emission benefits of CARB\u2019s ZEV \nsales mandate and GHG emission regulations. Upon \nreview, I find that SAFE 1\u2019s predicate for concluding \nthat California did not have a compelling need for these \nspecific standards was not reasonable given the record \nat the time of the ACC program waiver and once again \nduring the SAFE 1 proceeding. A reasonable, accurate, \nand complete review of the record supports the need for \nCalifornia\u2019s specific GHG emission standards and ZEV \nsales mandate to meet compelling and extraordinary \nconditions in California. This is true whether I look at \nhow these standards reduce criteria pollution, GHG \npollution, or both. In sum, although I am not adopting \n\n282a\nthe interpretation of the second waiver prong set forth \nin SAFE 1, I find that the burden of proof necessary to \ndemonstrate that CARB\u2019s ZEV sales mandate and GHG \nemission standards are not needed to meet compelling and \nextraordinary conditions has not been met under either \ninterpretation of the second waiver prong. Therefore, I \nrescind the Agency\u2019s part of the SAFE 1 action to the \nextent it relied upon the second waiver prong to withdraw \nthe ACC program waiver. \nWith regard to the applicability of preemption under \nEPCA, I find that, to the extent EPA\u2019s authority to \nreconsider the ACC program waiver rested upon NHTSA\u2019s \njoint action at the time as well as the applicability of its \nEPCA interpretation to EPA\u2019s review, this statute falls \nclearly outside the confines of section 209(b) where EPA\u2019s \nauthority to grant, deny, and reconsider waivers resides. \nIn any event, the grounds for such action under SAFE \n1 no longer exist given NHTSA\u2019s recent final action \nwithdrawing its EPCA preemption rule in its entirety.\nEach of the decisions and justifications contained in \nthis final action is severable.\nThis decision rescinds EPA\u2019s SAFE 1 action and \ntherefore, as a result, the waiver of preemption EPA \ngranted to California for its ACC program ZEV sales \nmandates and GHG emission standards issued in 2013, \nincluding for the 2017 through 2025 model years, comes \nback into force.\n\n283a\nJudicial Review\nSection 307(b)(1) of the CAA governs judicial review \nof final actions by EPA. This section provides, in part, \nthat petitions for review must be filed in the Court of \nAppeals for the District of Columbia Circuit: (i) When \nthe agency action consists of \u201cnationally applicable \nregulations promulgated, or final actions taken, by \nthe Administrator,\u201d or (ii) when such action is locally \nor regionally applicable, but \u201csuch action is based on \na determination of nationwide scope or effect and if in \ntaking such action the Administrator finds and publishes \nthat such action is based on such a determination.\u201d For \nlocally or regionally applicable final actions, the CAA \nreserves to EPA complete discretion whether to invoke \nthe exception in (ii).\nThis final action is \u201cnationally applicable\u201d within \nthe meaning of section 307(b)(1). In the alternative, \nto the extent a court finds this action to be locally or \nregionally applicable, the Administrator is exercising \nthe complete discretion afforded to him under the CAA \nto make and publish a finding that this action is based on \na determination of \u201cnationwide scope or effect\u201d within \nthe meaning of section 307(b)(1).484 This action rescinds \nEPA\u2019s final action in SAFE 1, which withdrew a waiver \n484.\u2002  In deciding whether to invoke the exception by making and \npublishing a finding that this final action is based on a determination \nof nationwide scope or effect, the Administrator has also taken into \naccount a number of policy considerations, including his judgment \nbalancing the benefit of obtaining the D.C. Circuit\u2019s authoritative \ncentralized review versus allowing development of the issue in other \ncontexts and the best use of agency resources. \n\n284a\nfor new motor vehicle greenhouse gas emission standards \nand ZEV sales mandate granted to California under \nsection 209(b) of the CAA. In addition to California, \nsixteen other states and the District of Columbia have \nalready adopted California\u2019s motor vehicle greenhouse gas \nstandards. The other states are New York, Massachusetts, \nVermont, Maine, Pennsylvania, Connecticut, Rhode \nIsland, Washington, Oregon, Minnesota, New Jersey, \nNevada, Maryland, Virginia, Colorado, and Delaware.485 \nThese jurisdictions represent a wide geographic area \nand fall within eight different judicial circuits.486 In \naddition, this action will affect manufacturers nationwide \nwho produce vehicles to meet the emissions standards \nof these states. For these reasons, this final action is \nnationally applicable or, alternatively, the Administrator is \nexercising the complete discretion afforded to him by the \nCAA and hereby finds that this final action is based on a \ndetermination of nationwide scope or effect for purposes \nof section 307(b)(1) and is hereby publishing that finding \nin the Federal Register . \nUnder CAA section 307(b)(1), petitions for judicial \nreview of this action must be filed in the United States \nCourt of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit \n485.\u2002  The same states have adopted California\u2019s ZEV sales \nmandate regulation with the exception of Pennsylvania, Washington, \nand Delaware. \n486.\u2002  In the report on the 1977 Amendments that revised \nCAA section 307(b)(1), Congress noted that the Administrator\u2019s \ndetermination that the \u201cnationwide scope or effect\u201d exception applies \nwould be appropriate for any action that has a scope or effect beyond \na single judicial circuit.

          "task_beliefs": "My understanding of this case has significantly deepened. While my prior knowledge correctly identified the core issue as Article III standing and the D.C. Circuit's dismissal on redressability grounds, I now have the petitioners' specific legal arguments and framing of the case, drawn directly from their Petition for a Writ of Certiorari.\n\nThe petitioners are a broad coalition of fuel producers, agricultural associations (corn and soybean growers), and fuel retailers, indicating a perceived economic threat across the entire liquid fuels supply chain. They are challenging the EPA, which is supported by an equally powerful group of intervenors including California, numerous other states, major automakers (Ford, VW, Honda, etc.), and environmental organizations.\n\nThe petition presents two central questions to the Supreme Court:\n1.  **Standing/Redressability:** \"Whether a party may establish the redressability component of Article III standing by relying on the coercive and predictable effects of regulation on third parties.\" This is a direct assault on the D.C. Circuit's reasoning. The petitioners argue that the lower court's demand for direct evidence (like affidavits from automakers) of how third parties would react to a vacated rule creates an impossibly high and incorrect standard. They contend that where a regulation's entire purpose is to diminish demand for a plaintiff's product, vacating that regulation provides obvious redress. They cite key Supreme Court precedents like *Bennett v. Spear* and *Department of Commerce v. New York* to support the idea that predictable effects on third parties are sufficient to establish standing.\n2.  **The Merits:** \"Whether EPA\u2019s preemption waiver for California\u2019s greenhouse-gas emission standards and zero-emission-vehicle mandate is unlawful.\" The petitioners are not just seeking a remand on the standing issue; they are asking the Court to decide the case outright. Their merits argument has several prongs:\n    *   **Textual Argument:** Global climate change is not a \"compelling and extraordinary condition\" *within California* as required by Section 209(b) of the Clean Air Act, because it is a global phenomenon, not a local one like the smog the statute originally targeted.\n    *   **Causation Argument:** California does not \"need\" its own standards to \"meet\" climate change conditions, as state-level regulations will have no discernible impact on a global issue.\n    *   **Structural/Major Questions Argument:** They invoke the logic of *West Virginia v. EPA*, arguing that Congress did not use sufficiently clear language to delegate to the EPA the power to anoint a single state (California) as a de facto national regulator on an issue of vast economic and political significance.\n\nMy prediction must now weigh the strength of the petitioners' argument that the D.C. Circuit created too high a bar for redressability against the fact that several major automakers\u2014the regulated third parties\u2014have intervened to *defend* the regulation. This complicates the \"predictable effects\" argument, as the automakers' actions seem to run counter to the petitioners' theory of injury.",
          "design_beliefs": "My meta-level understanding of how to effectively analyze Supreme Court cases has been strongly validated and refined.\n\nMy foundational heuristic\u2014that the first step should be to locate and analyze the **Petition for a Writ of Certiorari**\u2014has proven to be exceptionally effective. This single document transformed my understanding from a general summary to a detailed map of the legal battlefield, providing the specific questions, arguments, and key precedents.\n\nBased on this success, I have developed several new and refined heuristics for my research methodology:\n1.  **Prioritize the \"Questions Presented\":** This section of the cert petition is the single most valuable part for quickly and accurately grasping the core legal issues as framed by the petitioner. It is the skeleton upon which all other arguments are built.\n2.  **Analyze the \"Parties to the Proceeding\":** This section is not mere boilerplate. Mapping the coalitions on each side (e.g., fuel/agriculture vs. government/automakers/environmentalists) provides immediate context on the political and economic stakes of the case and helps anticipate the arguments. The fact that regulated third parties (automakers) are defending the rule is a critical strategic insight gleaned from this section.\n3.  **Recognize Dual-Pronged Petitions:** The petitioners are asking for a ruling on both the procedural issue (standing) and the substantive issue (the merits). This is a strategic choice indicating they believe their merits argument is strong and that the issue is time-sensitive (the waiver expires after 2025), making a simple remand on standing an inadequate outcome. Identifying this pattern helps in understanding the petitioner's goals and the potential scope of a Supreme Court decision.\n4.  **Confirm the Research Workflow:** My initial plan to analyze the Cert Petition first, then seek the Brief in Opposition, and then research the cited precedents is confirmed as a logical and efficient path. The cert petition itself provides the direct pointers for the next two steps."

I have identified this one-sidedness as my primary knowledge gap. This action directly targets and resolves that gap by providing the respondents' (EPA, California, etc.) counterarguments on the two central issues: Article III standing and the merits of the waiver. Without this information, any prediction is pure speculation. Acquiring the Brief in Opposition will transform my belief state from a one-sided summary to a balanced, adversarial map of the core legal dispute, which is the most significant possible reduction in uncertainty at this stage.\n\nDesign EIG (0.8): This action serves as a critical test and validation of my evolving research methodology. My current design belief is that the optimal workflow is Cert Petition -> Brief in Opposition. Executing this action will confirm whether the BIO directly responds to the arguments in the petition, thereby validating this sequential analysis strategy. Furthermore, this action is the direct result of my newly formalized heuristic to 'explicitly identify the primary knowledge gap'. Its success will provide powerful positive feedback, cementing this metacognitive step as a core component of my general strategy for efficient information gathering. The gain is high because it validates and refines my entire process.",

See 42 \nU.S.C. 7543(a) and (b).  In 2013, EPA issued a waiver to \nallow California to impose certain vehicle-emissions \nstandards.  EPA partially withdrew that waiver in 2019 \nbut reinstated it in 2022.  Petitioners, who had not chal-\nlenged the 2013 waiver, then challenged EPA\u2019s 2022 re-\ninstatement decision.  The questions presented are as \nfollows: \n1. Whether petitioners have established the re-\ndressability component of Article III standing.  \n2. Whether EPA correctly interpreted 42 U.S.C. \n7543(b) when the agency granted California a waiver in \n2013 and reinstated that waiver in 2022.  \n \n \n \n \n \n\n(III) \nTABLE OF CONTENTS \nPage\nOpinion below ................................................................................ 1 \nJurisdiction .................................................................................... 1 \nStatement ...................................................................................... 1 \nArgument ....................................................................................... 9 \nA. \nThe court of appeals\u2019 redressability holding does \nnot warrant this court\u2019s review .................................... 10 \nB. \nThis Court should not grant certiorari on a novel \nstatutory issue that no court has addressed ............... 19 \nConclusion ................................................................................... 28 \nTABLE OF AUTHORITIES \nCases: \nAmerican Trucking Ass\u2019ns v.

App. 1a-49a) \nis reported at 98 F.4th 288.   \nJURISDICTION \nThe judgment of the court of appeals was entered on \nApril 9, 2024.  The petition for a writ of certiorari was \nfiled on July 2, 2004.  The jurisdiction of this Court is \ninvoked under 28 U.S.C. 1254(1). \nSTATEMENT \n1. Congress enacted the Clean Air Act (CAA or Act), \n42 U.S.C. 7401 et seq., \u201cto protect and enhance the qual-\nity of the Nation\u2019s air resources so as to promote the \npublic health and welfare and the productive capacity of \nits population,\u201d 42 U.S.C. 7401(b)(1).  Under the Act, \neach State generally has flexibility to determine how it \n\n2 \n \nwill meet air-quality goals.  Pet. App. 3a.  For \u201cnew mo-\ntor vehicles,\u201d however, the Act directs the Environmen-\ntal Protection Agency (EPA) to prescribe nationwide \n\u201cstandards applicable to the emission of any air pollu-\ntant  * * *  which in [its] judgment cause[s], or contrib-\nute[s] to, air pollution which may reasonably be antici-\npated to endanger public health or welfare.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \n7521(a)(1).  Section 209(a) of the Act generally preempts \nany \u201cState or any political subdivision thereof\u200a\u201d from \n\u201cadopt[ing] or attempt[ing] to enforce any standard re-\nlating to the control of emissions from new motor vehi-\ncles.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 7543(a).    \nIn turn, Section 209(b) of the Act, 42 U.S.C. 7543(b), \ncreates an exception to that preemption rule.  Section \n209(b) generally requires EPA to \u201cwaive application of \n[Section 209(a)] to any State which has adopted stand-\nards  * * *  for the control of emissions from new motor \nvehicles or new motor vehicle engines prior to March \n30, 1966, if the State determines that the State stand-\nards will be, in the aggregate, at least as protective of \npublic health and welfare as applicable Federal stand-\nards.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 7543(b)(1).  Section 209(b) further \nspecifies, however, that \u201c[n]o such waiver shall be \ngranted if the Administrator finds that\u201d:  \u201c(A) the de-\ntermination of the State is arbitrary and capricious, (B) \nsuch State does not need such State standards to meet \ncompelling and extraordinary conditions, or (C) such \nState standards and accompanying enforcement proce-\ndures are not consistent with section 7521(a) of this ti-\ntle.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 7543(b)(1)(A)-(C).   \nCalifornia is the only State that regulated vehicle \nemissions before March 30, 1966, so it is the only State \nthat is eligible for a waiver under Section 209(b).  En-\ngine Mfrs. Ass\u2019n v. EPA, 88 F.3d 1075, 1079 n.9 (D.C. \n\n3 \n \nCir. 1996).  Congress made a waiver available to Cali-\nfornia because, at the time the CAA was enacted, the \nState \u201cwas already the \u2018lead[er] in the establishment of \nstandards for regulation of automotive pollutant emis-\nsions\u2019 at a time when the federal government had yet to \npromulgate any regulations of its own.\u201d  Id. at 1079 (ci-\ntation omitted; brackets in original).  Congress also rec-\nognized \u201cthe unique problems facing California as a re-\nsult of its climate and topography.\u201d  H.R. Rep. No. 728, \n90th Cong., 1st Sess. 22 (1967).  \nUnder the original 1967 CAA provision, a waiver of \npreemption was available only if California\u2019s standards \nwere \u201cmore stringent than applicable Federal stand-\nards.\u201d  Air Quality Act of 1967, Pub. L. No. 90-148, \n\u00a7 208(b), 81 Stat. 501.  In 1977, Congress amended Sec-\ntion 209(b) to \u201cexpand California\u2019s flexibility to adopt a \ncomplete program of motor vehicle emissions control.\u201d  \nMotor & Equipment Mfrs.

No. 95-95, \u00a7\u202f207, 91 Stat. 755.  \nThe 1977 amendments added language (quoted above) \nspecifying that, to obtain a waiver, California need only \ndetermine that its standards \u201cwill be, in the aggregate, \nat least as protective\u201d as federal standards.  \u00a7\u202f207, 91 \nStat. 755.  The 1977 amendments also allowed other \nStates to \u201cadopt and enforce\u201d vehicle-emissions stand-\nards that \u201care identical to the California standards for \nwhich a waiver has been granted for such model year.\u201d  \n42 U.S.C. 7507(1); see \u00a7 177(1), 91 Stat. 750. \nSince the CAA\u2019s enactment, EPA has granted 75 \nSection 209(b) waivers for California\u2019s vehicle-emis-\nsions program.  Pet. App. 9a.  In 1993, EPA granted a \nwaiver for California\u2019s \u201c\u200a\u2018Zero Emission Vehicle\u2019 pro-\n\n4 \n \nduction requirement,\u201d which required an annually in-\ncreasing percentage of vehicles sold in California to pro-\nduce zero on-road emissions.  58 Fed. Reg. 4166, 4166 \n(Jan. 13, 1993).  And in 2009, EPA granted a waiver for \nCalifornia\u2019s first set of greenhouse-gas emission stand-\nards.  74 Fed. Reg. 32,744, 32,745-32,747 (July 8, 2009).  \nDespite its substantial regulatory efforts, California \n\u201ccontinue[s] to face significant pollution and climate \nchallenges.\u201d  Pet. App. 10a.  California is home to seven \nof the Nation\u2019s ten worst areas for ozone pollution and \nsix of the Nation\u2019s ten worst areas for small particulate \nmatter.  See 87 Fed. Reg. 14,332 14,377 n.469 (Mar. 14, \n2022).  And the State \u201cis particularly impacted by cli-\nmate change,\u201d including through \u201cincreasing risks from \nrecord-setting fires, heat waves, storm surges, sea-level \nrise, water supply shortages and extreme heat.\u201d  Id. at \n14,365; see id. at 14,334 n.10. \n2. This case concerns a set of emissions standards, \nknown as the Advanced Clean Car (ACC) program, that \nCalifornia adopted in 2012.  That program includes a \nlow-emission-vehicle program, which (as relevant here) \nestablishes \u201cstandards to regulate [greenhouse-gas] \nemissions.\u201d  78 Fed. Reg. 2112, 2114 (Jan. 9, 2013).  It \nalso includes a zero-emission-vehicle program, which \nrequires a certain percentage of manufacturers\u2019 fleets \nto be zero-emission vehicles.  See id. at 2114-2115.  Un-\nder the ACC as originally constructed, both the low-\nemission-vehicle program and the zero-emission-vehicle \nprogram increase in stringency through model-year \n2025.  See Cal. Code Regs. tit. 13, \u00a7 1961.3(a)(1)(A) \n(2024); C.A. Admin. R. Doc. 7, at 22; C.A. Admin. R. Doc. \n811, at 1.  After model-year 2025, the programs were \ndesigned to remain in effect, with their stringency held \nconstant at 2025 levels.  See ibid.; see also 78 Fed. Reg. \n\n5 \n \nat 2119 (describing the ACC\u2019s zero-emission-vehicle re-\nquirements as extending through \u201c2025 and beyond\u201d).  \nIn 2013, EPA found \u201cthat the entire ACC program \nme[t] the criteria for a waiver of Clean Air Act preemp-\ntion and thus  * * *  grant[ed] a waiver for [California\u2019s] \nACC program.\u201d  78 Fed. Reg. at 2113; see id. at 2112. \nCalifornia amended its ACC zero-emission-vehicle \nstandards in 2022 so that they expire following model-\nyear 2025.  See Cal. Code Regs. tit. 13, \u00a7 1962.2 (2024).  \nCalifornia intends to replace those standards as part of \na new program known as ACC II, which includes increas-\ning zero-emission-vehicle requirements from model-\nyear 2026 through model-year 2035 and then holds the \n2035 levels constant for subsequent years.  See id. \n\u00a7 1962.4 (2024).  California has sought a CAA waiver for \nACC II, but EPA has not yet acted on that request.  In \ncontrast, California has not amended the ACC\u2019s low-\nemission-vehicle standards for greenhouse-gas emis-\nsions; those standards will continue to hold greenhouse-\ngas emissions at the stringency level set for model-year \n2025 \nin \n\u201csubsequent\u201d \nmodel \nyears. \n \nSee \nid. \n\u00a7 1961.3(a)(1)(A) (2024). \nIn 2019, \u201cafter car manufacturers had adjusted their \nfleets to comply with California\u2019s Advanced Clean Car \nProgram,\u201d Pet. App. 12a, EPA withdrew California\u2019s \nwaiver for the portions of that program that addressed \nzero-emission vehicles and set low-emission-vehicle \nstandards for greenhouse gases, 84 Fed. Reg. 51,310, \n51,310 (Sept. 27, 2019).  EPA articulated three bases for \nthe withdrawal.  See id. at 51,328-51,341.  First, EPA \nbelieved that portions of the waiver conflicted with a \nthen-recent determination by the National Highway \nTraffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) that state \ngreenhouse-gas regulations like California\u2019s were \n\n6 \n \npreempted by the Energy Policy and Conservation Act \n(EPCA), 49 U.S.C. 32919(a).  84 Fed. Reg. at 51,337-\n51,338.  Second, EPA asserted that Section 209(b) re-\nquires examination of California\u2019s emission standards in \nisolation, rather than \u201cCalifornia\u2019s entire program in \nthe aggregate.\u201d  Id. at 51,341.  Third, EPA determined \nthat California could not demonstrate that its low-emis-\nsion-vehicle standards for greenhouse gases and its \nzero-emission-vehicle regulations were needed to meet \ncompelling and extraordinary conditions because, in \nEPA\u2019s view, California could not show a \u201cparticularized \nnexus\u201d between greenhouse-gas emissions and Califor-\nnia\u2019s air-pollution problems.  Ibid. \nAfter EPA withdrew the 2013 waiver, automobile \nmanufacturers representing nearly 30% of U.S. vehicle \nsales, including Honda, Ford, Volvo, BMW, and Volks-\nwagen, entered into independent agreements with Cal-\nifornia under which the manufacturers would continue \nto meet California\u2019s low-emission-vehicle and zero-\nemission-vehicle standards.  See 87 Fed. Reg. at 14,346 \nn.115.  \u201cAutomakers were motivated to sign these \nagreements by the investments they had already made \nin updating their fleets and growing consumer demand \nfor electric vehicles.\u201d  Pet. App. 14a.   \nIn 2022, EPA reinstated California\u2019s 2013 waiver.  87 \nFed. Reg. at 14,332.  EPA identified three principal \ngrounds for its reinstatement decision.  First, EPA con-\ncluded that it had made procedural errors in 2019 when \nthe agency reconsidered the 2013 waiver.  Id. at 14,333.  \nSecond, EPA determined that the 2019 withdrawal de-\ncision had rested on a faulty interpretation and applica-\ntion of Section 209(b).  Ibid.  Third, the agency found \nthat it had improperly considered NHTSA\u2019s interpre-\n\n7 \n \ntation of EPCA, which NHTSA had since withdrawn in \nany event.  Ibid.; see Pet. App. 14a.   \n3. Petitioners, a group of entities that produce or \nsell liquid fuels and raw materials used to produce those \nfuels, sought judicial review of EPA\u2019s 2022 reinstate-\nment decision in the D.C. Circuit.  See Pet. App. 2a; 42 \nU.S.C. 7607(b)(1).1  Petitioners argued that EPA\u2019s rein-\nstatement decision exceeded the agency\u2019s authority un-\nder Section 209(b).  Pet. App. 3a.  Various States (in-\ncluding California) and localities, automakers, and envi-\nronmental organizations intervened in support of EPA.  \nId. at 15a & nn.4-6.   \nThe court of appeals dismissed petitioners\u2019 claims for \nlack of Article III standing.  Pet. App. 1a-49a.  Petition-\ners asserted that the 2022 reinstatement decision \u201cwill \ncause them economic injury.\u201d  Id. at 16a.  The court con-\ncluded, however, that petitioners had not \u201cmet their \nburden of demonstrating that those injuries are re-\ndressable\u201d by a judicial decree holding the challenged \nEPA decision invalid.  Id. at 19a. \nIn the court of appeals, petitioners \u201cargue[d] that, by \nrequiring vehicle manufacturers to sell vehicles that use \nless or no liquid fuel, California\u2019s [low-emission-vehicle] \nand [zero-emission-vehicle] requirements depress the \ndemand for liquid fuels\u201d that petitioners \u201cproduce and \nsell.\u201d  Pet. App. 19a.  \u201cThe difficulty for\u201d petitioners, the \ncourt observed, \u201cis that their claimed injuries \u2018hinge[] \non\u2019 the actions of third parties\u2014the automobile manu-\nfacturers who are subject to the waiver.\u201d  Id. at 22a \n \n1 A group of 17 States also sought judicial review.  See Pet. App. \n2a & n.1.  Those States have filed a separate petition for a writ of \ncertiorari seeking review of the D.C. Circuit\u2019s decision in this case.  \nSee Ohio v. EPA, No. 24-13 (filed July 5, 2024).  The government is \nfiling a separate brief opposing that petition.   \n\n8 \n \n(citation omitted).  The court explained that petitioners\u2019 \n\u201cinjuries would be redressed only if automobile manu-\nfacturers responded to vacatur of the waiver by produc-\ning and selling fewer non-conventional vehicles or by al-\ntering the prices of their vehicles such that fewer non-\nconventional vehicles\u2014and more conventional vehicles \n\u2014were sold.\u201d  Ibid. \nThe court of appeals also observed that \u201credressabil-\nity is further complicated by the relatively short dura-\ntion of the waiver that Petitioners challenge.\u201d  Pet. App. \n22a.  The court stated that petitioners had challenged \nonly EPA\u2019s 2022 decision \u201cto reinstate the waiver it had \npreviously granted California as to Model Years 2017 \nthrough 2025.\u201d  Ibid.  So \u201cto meet their burden of \ndemonstrating redressability,\u201d the court concluded, pe-\ntitioners would need to \u201cdemonstrate a \u2018substantial \nprobability\u2019 not only that automobile manufacturers are \nlikely to respond to a decision of this Court by changing \ntheir fleets in a way that alleviates their injuries in some \nway, but also that automobile manufacturers would do \nso relatively quickly\u2014by Model Year 2025.\u201d  Id. at 23a \n(citation omitted). \nThe court of appeals determined that \u201c[t]he record \nevidence provides no basis\u201d for finding redressability.  \nPet. App. 23a.  The court first noted that petitioners had \n\u201cfail[ed] to point to any evidence affirmatively demon-\nstrating that vacatur of the waiver would be substan-\ntially likely to result in any change to automobile man-\nufacturers\u2019 vehicle fleets by Model Year 2025.\u201d  Ibid.  \nIndeed, the court found that \u201c[t]he only evidence points \nin the opposite direction, indicating that automobile \nmanufacturers need years of lead time to make changes \nto their future model year fleets.\u201d  Ibid., see id. at 23a-\n\n9 \n \n24a (citing rulemaking comments by various automak-\ners). \nThe court of appeals further emphasized record evi-\ndence showing that \u201c\u200a\u2018manufacturers are already selling \nmore qualifying vehicles in California than the State\u2019s \nstandards require,\u2019\u200a\u201d which \u201csuggest[s] that vacatur of \nthe zero-emission-vehicle mandate would not redress \nPetitioners\u2019 injuries.\u201d  Pet. App. 28a (citation omitted).  \nThe court observed that several automobile manufac-\nturers had filed a brief explaining \u201cthat \u2018both internal \nsustainability goals and external market forces\u2019 are \nprompting manufacturers to transition toward electric \nvehicles, irrespective of California\u2019s regulations.\u201d  Id. at \n24a n.8 (citation omitted).  The court thus perceived a \nlack of evidence that \u201cvacatur of the challenged waiver\u201d \nwould \u201cresult in any change on the part of automobile \nmanufacturers.\u201d  Id. at 27a. \nThe court of appeals observed that, \u201c[d]espite the \npaucity of evidence in the record regarding the redress-\nability of their injuries\u201d and \u201cthe relatively short nature \nof the waiver they challenge,\u201d petitioners \u201cseem to have \ntreated redressability as a foregone conclusion.\u201d  Pet. \nApp. 24a-25a.  The court noted that petitioners had not \n\u201cattempt[ed] to explain in any detail how their injuries \nare redressable, let alone to \u2018cit[e] any record evidence\u2019 \nor to file \u2018additional affidavits or other evidence suffi-\ncient to support\u2019 redressability.\u201d  Ibid. (citation omit-\nted; second set of brackets in original).  The court there-\nfore had \u201cno basis to conclude that Petitioners\u2019 claims \nare redressable\u2014a necessary element of standing that \nPetitioners bear the burden of establishing.\u201d  Id. at 29a.  \nARGUMENT \nPetitioners ask (Pet. 15-26) this Court to review the \ncourt of appeals\u2019 holding that, in light of \u201cthe record \n\n10 \n \nevidence\u201d in this case, petitioners have not shown that \na favorable judicial ruling would redress their injuries.  \nPet. App. 29a.  The court below applied established Ar-\nticle III principles to the record here and properly con-\ncluded that petitioners had not shown that their injuries \nare redressable. That fact-bound conclusion does not \nconflict with any decision of another court of appeals or \notherwise warrant this Court\u2019s intervention. \nPetitioners also ask (Pet. 26-37) this Court to grant \ncertiorari to consider the merits of their statutory argu-\nment, even though neither the court of appeals nor any \nother court has addressed that argument.  But multiple \nthreshold issues could thwart this Court\u2019s review of that \nargument.  And in any event, this Court traditionally \nacts as a Court of review, not of first view.  Nor is there \nany compelling need to review the statutory issue now, \nparticularly because that same issue is currently pend-\ning before the D.C. Circuit in a separate case.  The pe-\ntition should be denied.     \nA. The Court Of Appeals\u2019 Redressability Holding Does Not \nWarrant This Court\u2019s Review \nApplying settled standing principles to the record \nevidence in this case, the court of appeals held that pe-\ntitioners had failed to establish that their asserted inju-\nries are redressable.  The court\u2019s conclusion was correct \nand does not warrant this Court\u2019s review.       \n1. a. \u201c[I]t is a bedrock principle that a federal court \ncannot redress \u2018injury that results from the independ-\nent action of some third party not before the court.\u2019\u200a\u201d  \nMurthy v. Missouri, 144 S. Ct. 1972, 1986 (2024) (cita-\ntion omitted).  \u201cIn keeping with this principle,\u201d  \nthe Court has \u201c\u200a\u2018been reluctant to endorse standing the-\nories that require guesswork as to how independent  \ndecisionmakers will exercise their judgment.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Ibid. \n\n11 \n \n(quoting Clapper v. Amnesty Int\u2019l USA, 568 U.S. 398, \n413 (2013)).  The Court has recently and repeatedly re-\njected, on redressability grounds, claims of Article III \nstanding that depend on such guesswork.  See, e.g., \nMurthy, 144 S. Ct. at 1995; Haaland v. Brackeen, 599 \nU.S. 255, 294 (2023); Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 \nU.S. 555, 568-571 (1992). \nHere, the court of appeals properly observed that pe-\ntitioners\u2019 asserted injuries \u201chinge on the response\u201d of a \n\u201cthird party to the government action,\u201d Defenders of \nWildlife, 504 U.S. at 562\u2014namely, \u201cthe automobile \nmanufacturers who are subject to [EPA\u2019s] waiver.\u201d  Pet. \nApp. 22a.  Yet because the 2013 waiver has now been in \neffect for over a decade, automakers have made signifi-\ncant \u201cinvestments\u201d in \u201cupdating their fleets and grow-\ning consumer demand for electric vehicles.\u201d  Id. at 14a.  \nIn addition, \u201c\u200a\u2018both internal sustainability goals and ex-\nternal market forces\u2019 are prompting [them] to transi-\ntion toward electric vehicles, irrespective of California\u2019s \nregulations.\u201d  Id. at 24a n.8 (citation omitted).  And EPA \nhas promulgated federal greenhouse-gas emissions \nstandards that outpace California\u2019s comparable stand-\nards and govern model-years 2023 through 2032 (and \nthen subsequent years).  See 86 Fed. Reg. 74,434 (Dec. \n30, 2021); 89\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

See 42 \nU.S.C. 7543(a) and (b).  In 2013, EPA issued a waiver to \nallow California to impose certain vehicle-emissions \nstandards.  EPA partially withdrew that waiver in 2019 \nbut reinstated it in 2022.  Petitioners, who had not chal-\nlenged the 2013 waiver, then challenged EPA\u2019s 2022 re-\ninstatement decision.  The questions presented are as \nfollows: \n1. Whether petitioners have established the re-\ndressability component of Article III standing.  \n2. Whether EPA correctly interpreted 42 U.S.C. \n7543(b) when the agency granted California a waiver in \n2013 and reinstated that waiver in 2022.  \n \n \n \n \n \n\n(III) \nTABLE OF CONTENTS \nPage\nOpinion below ................................................................................ 1 \nJurisdiction .................................................................................... 1 \nStatement ...................................................................................... 1 \nArgument ....................................................................................... 9 \nA. \nThe court of appeals\u2019 redressability holding does \nnot warrant this court\u2019s review .................................... 10 \nB. \nThis Court should not grant certiorari on a novel \nstatutory issue that no court has addressed ............... 19 \nConclusion ................................................................................... 28 \nTABLE OF AUTHORITIES \nCases: \nAmerican Trucking Ass\u2019ns v.

App. 1a-49a) \nis reported at 98 F.4th 288.   \nJURISDICTION \nThe judgment of the court of appeals was entered on \nApril 9, 2024.  The petition for a writ of certiorari was \nfiled on July 2, 2004.  The jurisdiction of this Court is \ninvoked under 28 U.S.C. 1254(1). \nSTATEMENT \n1. Congress enacted the Clean Air Act (CAA or Act), \n42 U.S.C. 7401 et seq., \u201cto protect and enhance the qual-\nity of the Nation\u2019s air resources so as to promote the \npublic health and welfare and the productive capacity of \nits population,\u201d 42 U.S.C. 7401(b)(1).  Under the Act, \neach State generally has flexibility to determine how it \n\n2 \n \nwill meet air-quality goals.  Pet. App. 3a.  For \u201cnew mo-\ntor vehicles,\u201d however, the Act directs the Environmen-\ntal Protection Agency (EPA) to prescribe nationwide \n\u201cstandards applicable to the emission of any air pollu-\ntant  * * *  which in [its] judgment cause[s], or contrib-\nute[s] to, air pollution which may reasonably be antici-\npated to endanger public health or welfare.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \n7521(a)(1).  Section 209(a) of the Act generally preempts \nany \u201cState or any political subdivision thereof\u200a\u201d from \n\u201cadopt[ing] or attempt[ing] to enforce any standard re-\nlating to the control of emissions from new motor vehi-\ncles.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 7543(a).    \nIn turn, Section 209(b) of the Act, 42 U.S.C. 7543(b), \ncreates an exception to that preemption rule.  Section \n209(b) generally requires EPA to \u201cwaive application of \n[Section 209(a)] to any State which has adopted stand-\nards  * * *  for the control of emissions from new motor \nvehicles or new motor vehicle engines prior to March \n30, 1966, if the State determines that the State stand-\nards will be, in the aggregate, at least as protective of \npublic health and welfare as applicable Federal stand-\nards.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 7543(b)(1).  Section 209(b) further \nspecifies, however, that \u201c[n]o such waiver shall be \ngranted if the Administrator finds that\u201d:  \u201c(A) the de-\ntermination of the State is arbitrary and capricious, (B) \nsuch State does not need such State standards to meet \ncompelling and extraordinary conditions, or (C) such \nState standards and accompanying enforcement proce-\ndures are not consistent with section 7521(a) of this ti-\ntle.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 7543(b)(1)(A)-(C).   \nCalifornia is the only State that regulated vehicle \nemissions before March 30, 1966, so it is the only State \nthat is eligible for a waiver under Section 209(b).  En-\ngine Mfrs. Ass\u2019n v. EPA, 88 F.3d 1075, 1079 n.9 (D.C. \n\n3 \n \nCir. 1996).  Congress made a waiver available to Cali-\nfornia because, at the time the CAA was enacted, the \nState \u201cwas already the \u2018lead[er] in the establishment of \nstandards for regulation of automotive pollutant emis-\nsions\u2019 at a time when the federal government had yet to \npromulgate any regulations of its own.\u201d  Id. at 1079 (ci-\ntation omitted; brackets in original).  Congress also rec-\nognized \u201cthe unique problems facing California as a re-\nsult of its climate and topography.\u201d  H.R. Rep. No. 728, \n90th Cong., 1st Sess. 22 (1967).  \nUnder the original 1967 CAA provision, a waiver of \npreemption was available only if California\u2019s standards \nwere \u201cmore stringent than applicable Federal stand-\nards.\u201d  Air Quality Act of 1967, Pub. L. No. 90-148, \n\u00a7 208(b), 81 Stat. 501.  In 1977, Congress amended Sec-\ntion 209(b) to \u201cexpand California\u2019s flexibility to adopt a \ncomplete program of motor vehicle emissions control.\u201d  \nMotor & Equipment Mfrs. Ass\u2019n v. EPA, 627 F.2d 1095, \n1110-1111 (D.C. Cir. 1979), cert. denied, 446 U.S. 952 \n(1980); see Clean Air Act Amendments of 1977 (1977 \namendments), Pub. L. No. 95-95, \u00a7\u202f207, 91 Stat. 755.  \nThe 1977 amendments added language (quoted above) \nspecifying that, to obtain a waiver, California need only \ndetermine that its standards \u201cwill be, in the aggregate, \nat least as protective\u201d as federal standards.  \u00a7\u202f207, 91 \nStat. 755.  The 1977 amendments also allowed other \nStates to \u201cadopt and enforce\u201d vehicle-emissions stand-\nards that \u201care identical to the California standards for \nwhich a waiver has been granted for such model year.\u201d  \n42 U.S.C. 7507(1); see \u00a7 177(1), 91 Stat. 750. \nSince the CAA\u2019s enactment, EPA has granted 75 \nSection 209(b) waivers for California\u2019s vehicle-emis-\nsions program.  Pet. App. 9a.  In 1993, EPA granted a \nwaiver for California\u2019s \u201c\u200a\u2018Zero Emission Vehicle\u2019 pro-\n\n4 \n \nduction requirement,\u201d which required an annually in-\ncreasing percentage of vehicles sold in California to pro-\nduce zero on-road emissions.  58 Fed. Reg. 4166, 4166 \n(Jan. 13, 1993).  And in 2009, EPA granted a waiver for \nCalifornia\u2019s first set of greenhouse-gas emission stand-\nards.  74 Fed. Reg. 32,744, 32,745-32,747 (July 8, 2009).  \nDespite its substantial regulatory efforts, California \n\u201ccontinue[s] to face significant pollution and climate \nchallenges.\u201d  Pet. App. 10a.  California is home to seven \nof the Nation\u2019s ten worst areas for ozone pollution and \nsix of the Nation\u2019s ten worst areas for small particulate \nmatter.  See 87 Fed. Reg. 14,332 14,377 n.469 (Mar. 14, \n2022).  And the State \u201cis particularly impacted by cli-\nmate change,\u201d including through \u201cincreasing risks from \nrecord-setting fires, heat waves, storm surges, sea-level \nrise, water supply shortages and extreme heat.\u201d  Id. at \n14,365; see id. at 14,334 n.10. \n2. This case concerns a set of emissions standards, \nknown as the Advanced Clean Car (ACC) program, that \nCalifornia adopted in 2012.  That program includes a \nlow-emission-vehicle program, which (as relevant here) \nestablishes \u201cstandards to regulate [greenhouse-gas] \nemissions.\u201d  78 Fed. Reg. 2112, 2114 (Jan. 9, 2013).  It \nalso includes a zero-emission-vehicle program, which \nrequires a certain percentage of manufacturers\u2019 fleets \nto be zero-emission vehicles.  See id. at 2114-2115.  Un-\nder the ACC as originally constructed, both the low-\nemission-vehicle program and the zero-emission-vehicle \nprogram increase in stringency through model-year \n2025.  See Cal. Code Regs. tit. 13, \u00a7 1961.3(a)(1)(A) \n(2024); C.A. Admin. R. Doc. 7, at 22; C.A. Admin. R. Doc. \n811, at 1.  After model-year 2025, the programs were \ndesigned to remain in effect, with their stringency held \nconstant at 2025 levels.  See ibid.; see also 78 Fed. Reg. \n\n5 \n \nat 2119 (describing the ACC\u2019s zero-emission-vehicle re-\nquirements as extending through \u201c2025 and beyond\u201d).  \nIn 2013, EPA found \u201cthat the entire ACC program \nme[t] the criteria for a waiver of Clean Air Act preemp-\ntion and thus  * * *  grant[ed] a waiver for [California\u2019s] \nACC program.\u201d  78 Fed. Reg. at 2113; see id. at 2112. \nCalifornia amended its ACC zero-emission-vehicle \nstandards in 2022 so that they expire following model-\nyear 2025.  See Cal. Code Regs. tit. 13, \u00a7 1962.2 (2024).  \nCalifornia intends to replace those standards as part of \na new program known as ACC II, which includes increas-\ning zero-emission-vehicle requirements from model-\nyear 2026 through model-year 2035 and then holds the \n2035 levels constant for subsequent years.  See id. \n\u00a7 1962.4 (2024).  California has sought a CAA waiver for \nACC II, but EPA has not yet acted on that request.  In \ncontrast, California has not amended the ACC\u2019s low-\nemission-vehicle standards for greenhouse-gas emis-\nsions; those standards will continue to hold greenhouse-\ngas emissions at the stringency level set for model-year \n2025 \nin \n\u201csubsequent\u201d \nmodel \nyears. \n \nSee \nid. \n\u00a7 1961.3(a)(1)(A) (2024). \nIn 2019, \u201cafter car manufacturers had adjusted their \nfleets to comply with California\u2019s Advanced Clean Car \nProgram,\u201d Pet. App. 12a, EPA withdrew California\u2019s \nwaiver for the portions of that program that addressed \nzero-emission vehicles and set low-emission-vehicle \nstandards for greenhouse gases, 84 Fed. Reg. 51,310, \n51,310 (Sept. 27, 2019).  EPA articulated three bases for \nthe withdrawal.  See id. at 51,328-51,341.  First, EPA \nbelieved that portions of the waiver conflicted with a \nthen-recent determination by the National Highway \nTraffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) that state \ngreenhouse-gas regulations like California\u2019s were \n\n6 \n \npreempted by the Energy Policy and Conservation Act \n(EPCA), 49 U.S.C. 32919(a).  84 Fed. Reg. at 51,337-\n51,338.  Second, EPA asserted that Section 209(b) re-\nquires examination of California\u2019s emission standards in \nisolation, rather than \u201cCalifornia\u2019s entire program in \nthe aggregate.\u201d  Id. at 51,341.  Third, EPA determined \nthat California could not demonstrate that its low-emis-\nsion-vehicle standards for greenhouse gases and its \nzero-emission-vehicle regulations were needed to meet \ncompelling and extraordinary conditions because, in \nEPA\u2019s view, California could not show a \u201cparticularized \nnexus\u201d between greenhouse-gas emissions and Califor-\nnia\u2019s air-pollution problems.  Ibid. \nAfter EPA withdrew the 2013 waiver, automobile \nmanufacturers representing nearly 30% of U.S. vehicle \nsales, including Honda, Ford, Volvo, BMW, and Volks-\nwagen, entered into independent agreements with Cal-\nifornia under which the manufacturers would continue \nto meet California\u2019s low-emission-vehicle and zero-\nemission-vehicle standards.  See 87 Fed. Reg. at 14,346 \nn.115.  \u201cAutomakers were motivated to sign these \nagreements by the investments they had already made \nin updating their fleets and growing consumer demand \nfor electric vehicles.\u201d  Pet. App. 14a.   \nIn 2022, EPA reinstated California\u2019s 2013 waiver.  87 \nFed. Reg. at 14,332.  EPA identified three principal \ngrounds for its reinstatement decision.  First, EPA con-\ncluded that it had made procedural errors in 2019 when \nthe agency reconsidered the 2013 waiver.  Id. at 14,333.  \nSecond, EPA determined that the 2019 withdrawal de-\ncision had rested on a faulty interpretation and applica-\ntion of Section 209(b).  Ibid.  Third, the agency found \nthat it had improperly considered NHTSA\u2019s interpre-\n\n7 \n \ntation of EPCA, which NHTSA had since withdrawn in \nany event.  Ibid.; see Pet. App. 14a.   \n3. Petitioners, a group of entities that produce or \nsell liquid fuels and raw materials used to produce those \nfuels, sought judicial review of EPA\u2019s 2022 reinstate-\nment decision in the D.C. Circuit.  See Pet. App. 2a; 42 \nU.S.C. 7607(b)(1).1  Petitioners argued that EPA\u2019s rein-\nstatement decision exceeded the agency\u2019s authority un-\nder Section 209(b).  Pet. App. 3a.  Various States (in-\ncluding California) and localities, automakers, and envi-\nronmental organizations intervened in support of EPA.  \nId. at 15a & nn.4-6.   \nThe court of appeals dismissed petitioners\u2019 claims for \nlack of Article III standing.  Pet. App. 1a-49a.  Petition-\ners asserted that the 2022 reinstatement decision \u201cwill \ncause them economic injury.\u201d  Id. at 16a.  The court con-\ncluded, however, that petitioners had not \u201cmet their \nburden of demonstrating that those injuries are re-\ndressable\u201d by a judicial decree holding the challenged \nEPA decision invalid.  Id. at 19a. \nIn the court of appeals, petitioners \u201cargue[d] that, by \nrequiring vehicle manufacturers to sell vehicles that use \nless or no liquid fuel, California\u2019s [low-emission-vehicle] \nand [zero-emission-vehicle] requirements depress the \ndemand for liquid fuels\u201d that petitioners \u201cproduce and \nsell.\u201d  Pet. App. 19a.  \u201cThe difficulty for\u201d petitioners, the \ncourt observed, \u201cis that their claimed injuries \u2018hinge[] \non\u2019 the actions of third parties\u2014the automobile manu-\nfacturers who are subject to the waiver.\u201d  Id. at 22a \n \n1 A group of 17 States also sought judicial review.  See Pet. App. \n2a & n.1.  Those States have filed a separate petition for a writ of \ncertiorari seeking review of the D.C. Circuit\u2019s decision in this case.  \nSee Ohio v. EPA, No. 24-13 (filed July 5, 2024).  The government is \nfiling a separate brief opposing that petition.   \n\n8 \n \n(citation omitted).  The court explained that petitioners\u2019 \n\u201cinjuries would be redressed only if automobile manu-\nfacturers responded to vacatur of the waiver by produc-\ning and selling fewer non-conventional vehicles or by al-\ntering the prices of their vehicles such that fewer non-\nconventional vehicles\u2014and more conventional vehicles \n\u2014were sold.\u201d  Ibid. \nThe court of appeals also observed that \u201credressabil-\nity is further complicated by the relatively short dura-\ntion of the waiver that Petitioners challenge.\u201d  Pet. App. \n22a.  The court stated that petitioners had challenged \nonly EPA\u2019s 2022 decision \u201cto reinstate the waiver it had \npreviously granted California as to Model Years 2017 \nthrough 2025.\u201d  Ibid.  So \u201cto meet their burden of \ndemonstrating redressability,\u201d the court concluded, pe-\ntitioners would need to \u201cdemonstrate a \u2018substantial \nprobability\u2019 not only that automobile manufacturers are \nlikely to respond to a decision of this Court by changing \ntheir fleets in a way that alleviates their injuries in some \nway, but also that automobile manufacturers would do \nso relatively quickly\u2014by Model Year 2025.\u201d  Id. at 23a \n(citation omitted). \nThe court of appeals determined that \u201c[t]he record \nevidence provides no basis\u201d for finding redressability.  \nPet. App. 23a.  The court first noted that petitioners had \n\u201cfail[ed] to point to any evidence affirmatively demon-\nstrating that vacatur of the waiver would be substan-\ntially likely to result in any change to automobile man-\nufacturers\u2019 vehicle fleets by Model Year 2025.\u201d  Ibid.  \nIndeed, the court found that \u201c[t]he only evidence points \nin the opposite direction, indicating that automobile \nmanufacturers need years of lead time to make changes \nto their future model year fleets.\u201d  Ibid., see id. at 23a-\n\n9 \n \n24a (citing rulemaking comments by various automak-\ners). \nThe court of appeals further emphasized record evi-\ndence showing that \u201c\u200a\u2018manufacturers are already selling \nmore qualifying vehicles in California than the State\u2019s \nstandards require,\u2019\u200a\u201d which \u201csuggest[s] that vacatur of \nthe zero-emission-vehicle mandate would not redress \nPetitioners\u2019 injuries.\u201d  Pet. App. 28a (citation omitted).  \nThe court observed that several automobile manufac-\nturers had filed a brief explaining \u201cthat \u2018both internal \nsustainability goals and external market forces\u2019 are \nprompting manufacturers to transition toward electric \nvehicles, irrespective of California\u2019s regulations.\u201d  Id. at \n24a n.8 (citation omitted).  The court thus perceived a \nlack of evidence that \u201cvacatur of the challenged waiver\u201d \nwould \u201cresult in any change on the part of automobile \nmanufacturers.\u201d  Id. at 27a. \nThe court of appeals observed that, \u201c[d]espite the \npaucity of evidence in the record regarding the redress-\nability of their injuries\u201d and \u201cthe relatively short nature \nof the waiver they challenge,\u201d petitioners \u201cseem to have \ntreated redressability as a foregone conclusion.\u201d  Pet. \nApp. 24a-25a.  The court noted that petitioners had not \n\u201cattempt[ed] to explain in any detail how their injuries \nare redressable, let alone to \u2018cit[e] any record evidence\u2019 \nor to file \u2018additional affidavits or other evidence suffi-\ncient to support\u2019 redressability.\u201d  Ibid. (citation omit-\nted; second set of brackets in original).  The court there-\nfore had \u201cno basis to conclude that Petitioners\u2019 claims \nare redressable\u2014a necessary element of standing that \nPetitioners bear the burden of establishing.\u201d  Id. at 29a.  \nARGUMENT \nPetitioners ask (Pet. 15-26) this Court to review the \ncourt of appeals\u2019 holding that, in light of \u201cthe record \n\n10 \n \nevidence\u201d in this case, petitioners have not shown that \na favorable judicial ruling would redress their injuries.  \nPet. App. 29a.  The court below applied established Ar-\nticle III principles to the record here and properly con-\ncluded that petitioners had not shown that their injuries \nare redressable. That fact-bound conclusion does not \nconflict with any decision of another court of appeals or \notherwise warrant this Court\u2019s intervention. \nPetitioners also ask (Pet. 26-37) this Court to grant \ncertiorari to consider the merits of their statutory argu-\nment, even though neither the court of appeals nor any \nother court has addressed that argument.  But multiple \nthreshold issues could thwart this Court\u2019s review of that \nargument.  And in any event, this Court traditionally \nacts as a Court of review, not of first view.  Nor is there \nany compelling need to review the statutory issue now, \nparticularly because that same issue is currently pend-\ning before the D.C. Circuit in a separate case.  The pe-\ntition should be denied.     \nA. The Court Of Appeals\u2019 Redressability Holding Does Not \nWarrant This Court\u2019s Review \nApplying settled standing principles to the record \nevidence in this case, the court of appeals held that pe-\ntitioners had failed to establish that their asserted inju-\nries are redressable.  The court\u2019s conclusion was correct \nand does not warrant this Court\u2019s review.       \n1. a. \u201c[I]t is a bedrock principle that a federal court \ncannot redress \u2018injury that results from the independ-\nent action of some third party not before the court.\u2019\u200a\u201d  \nMurthy v. Missouri, 144 S. Ct. 1972, 1986 (2024) (cita-\ntion omitted).  \u201cIn keeping with this principle,\u201d  \nthe Court has \u201c\u200a\u2018been reluctant to endorse standing the-\nories that require guesswork as to how independent  \ndecisionmakers will exercise their judgment.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Ibid. \n\n11 \n \n(quoting Clapper v. Amnesty Int\u2019l USA, 568 U.S. 398, \n413 (2013)).  The Court has recently and repeatedly re-\njected, on redressability grounds, claims of Article III \nstanding that depend on such guesswork.  See, e.g., \nMurthy, 144 S. Ct. at 1995; Haaland v. Brackeen, 599 \nU.S. 255, 294 (2023); Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 \nU.S. 555, 568-571 (1992). \nHere, the court of appeals properly observed that pe-\ntitioners\u2019 asserted injuries \u201chinge on the response\u201d of a \n\u201cthird party to the government action,\u201d Defenders of \nWildlife, 504 U.S. at 562\u2014namely, \u201cthe automobile \nmanufacturers who are subject to [EPA\u2019s] waiver.\u201d  Pet. \nApp. 22a.  Yet because the 2013 waiver has now been in \neffect for over a decade, automakers have made signifi-\ncant \u201cinvestments\u201d in \u201cupdating their fleets and grow-\ning consumer demand for electric vehicles.\u201d  Id. at 14a.  \nIn addition, \u201c\u200a\u2018both internal sustainability goals and ex-\nternal market forces\u2019 are prompting [them] to transi-\ntion toward electric vehicles, irrespective of California\u2019s \nregulations.\u201d  Id. at 24a n.8 (citation omitted).  And EPA \nhas promulgated federal greenhouse-gas emissions \nstandards that outpace California\u2019s comparable stand-\nards and govern model-years 2023 through 2032 (and \nthen subsequent years).  See 86 Fed. Reg. 74,434 (Dec. \n30, 2021); 89 Fed. Reg. 27,842 (Apr. 18, 2024); 40 C.F.R. \n86.1818-12.  As a result of these various factors, manu-\nfacturers \u201care already selling more qualifying vehicles \nin California than the State\u2019s standards require.\u201d  Pet. \nApp. 28a (citation omitted); see C.A. State Resp.-Inter-\nvenors\u2019 Add. 98 (explaining that \u201cmultiple manufactur-\ners have announced plans to sell substantially more \nzero-emission vehicles in the future than [California\u2019s] \nstandards  * * *  require\u201d).    \n\n12 \n \nDespite that evidence of automakers\u2019 independent \nconduct, petitioners \u201ctreated redressability as a fore-\ngone conclusion.\u201d  Pet. App. 25a.  They did not \u201cat-\ntempt[] to explain in any detail how their injuries are \nredressable, let alone to \u2018cit[e] any record evidence\u2019 or \nto file \u2018additional affidavits or other evidence sufficient \nto support\u2019 redressability.\u201d  Id. at 24a-25a (citation \nomitted; second set of brackets in original).  Petitioners \naccordingly failed to meet their \u201cburden  * * *  to ad-\nduce facts showing that\u201d the third-party automakers \nwould act \u201cin such manner as to  * * *  permit redressa-\nbility of injury.\u201d  Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. at 562. \nThe court of appeals also relied on the \u201cshort dura-\ntion of the waiver that Petitioners challenge.\u201d  Pet. App. \n22a.  The court stated that the case \u201cconcern[s] only the \nEPA\u2019s decision, in March 2022, to reinstate the waiver \nit had previously granted California as to Model Years \n2017 through 2025.\u201d  Ibid.  To support that proposition, \nthe court cited EPA\u2019s 2022 reinstatement decision, \nwhich states that \u201c[a]s a result of this action, EPA\u2019s \n2013 waiver for the ACC program, specifically the \nwaiver for California\u2019s [greenhouse-gas] emission stand-\nards and [zero-emission vehicles] sales mandate re-\nquirements for model years (MYs) 2017 through 2025, \ncomes back into force.\u201d  87 Fed. Reg. at 14,333.   \nContrary to the court of appeals\u2019 suggestion, EPA\u2019s \n2013 waiver does not expire after model-year 2025.  As \nnoted above, in 2013, EPA found \u201cthat the entire ACC \nprogram me[t] the criteria for a waiver of Clean Air Act \npreemption and thus  * * *  grant[ed] a waiver for [Cal-\nifornia\u2019s] ACC program.\u201d  78 Fed. Reg. at 2113.  And \nalthough the 2022 reinstatement decision referenced re-\nquirements applicable through model-year 2025, it also \nnoted that, \u201cin 2013, EPA granted California\u2019s waiver \n\n13 \n \nrequest for the state\u2019s [ACC] program,\u201d and that the \n\u201cresult\u201d of the 2022 action was \u201cthe reinstatement of the \nACC program waiver.\u201d  87 Fed. Reg. at 14,332, 14,367.  \nAs originally constructed, the ACC program increased \nin stringency only through model-year 2025 but still re-\nmained in effect thereafter.  See pp. 4-5, supra.  Even \nnow, following California\u2019s enactment of ACC II, only \nthe ACC\u2019s zero-emission-vehicle program expires after \nmodel-year 2025, while the low-emission-vehicle stand-\nards for greenhouse-gas emissions remain in force \nthereafter (at 2025 levels of stringency).  See p. 5, su-\npra.  Thus, because EPA\u2019s 2013 waiver applied to the \nACC, and the ACC does not fully terminate with model-\nyear 2025, the waiver likewise does not terminate with \nmodel-year 2025.  \nIn this Court, petitioners have not challenged the \ncourt of appeals\u2019 apparent understanding that the 2013 \nwaiver sunsets after model-year 2025.  To the contrary, \npetitioners embrace that understanding (Pet. 26), argu-\ning that the Court\u2019s review of the second question pre-\nsented is urgently necessary \u201c[b]ecause California\u2019s \nwaiver expires at the end of model year 2025.\u201d  See Pet. \n4-5 (similar).  Especially given petitioners\u2019 acceptance \nof the court of appeals\u2019 apparent premise about the \nwaiver\u2019s duration, there is no basis for the Court to \ngrant certiorari to review that premise.              \nMore fundamentally, regardless of the 2013 waiver\u2019s \ncontinuing legal force, the waiver\u2019s practical effects are \ngreatly diminished by intervening changes in the mar-\nket.  The court of appeals considered multiple factors, \nand its ultimate conclusion on redressability was cor-\nrect.  As explained above, record evidence indicates \nthat, because of market forces and other independent \nfactors, \u201cvacatur of the challenged waiver may not \n\n14 \n \nresult in any change on the part of automobile manufac-\nturers.\u201d  Pet. App. 27a.  And petitioners failed to present \ntheir own evidence suggesting otherwise.  On this record \nand in light of petitioners\u2019 presentation, the court \nproperly found that petitioners had \u201cfailed to meet their \nburdens of demonstrating that their claims are redress-\nable.\u201d  Id. at 30a.      \nb. Petitioners\u2019 counterarguments lack merit.  Peti-\ntioners contend (Pet. 18) that, if EPA\u2019s waiver were va-\ncated, \u201cthen the government will no longer be forcing \nautomakers to sell more electric vehicles,\u201d so automak-\ners will \u201cmake more vehicles that run on liquid fuel, or \nthey will adjust their prices.\u201d  According to petitioners \n(ibid.), \u201c[t]hat is Economics 101, not a proposition that \nrequires an affidavit for support.\u201d \nWhile there may be cases where commonsense eco-\nnomic principles can suffice to establish redressability, \nthe court of appeals correctly held that this is not one of \nthem, given the record evidence about the automobile-\nmanufacturing market discussed above.  To be sure, pe-\ntitioners could have sought to offer their own evidence \nshowing that automakers would likely change course if \nthe challenged EPA waiver was vacated.  But petition-\ners instead provided \u201cconclusory\u201d declarations simply \nstating that petitioners\u2019 injuries \u201c\u200a\u2018would be substan-\ntially ameliorated if EPA\u2019s decision were set aside.\u2019\u200a\u201d  \nPet. App. 22a.   \nPetitioners briefly contest (Pet. 19-20) the court of \nappeals\u2019 reading of the declarations in the record.  But \nissues that \u201cturn[] entirely on an interpretation of the \nrecord in one particular case\u201d are the \u201cquintessential \nexample of the kind that [this Court] almost never re-\nview[s].\u201d  Taylor v. Riojas, 592 U.S. 7, 11 (2020) (per \ncuriam) (Alito, J., concurring in the judgment).  In any \n\n15 \n \nevent, petitioners\u2019 reading of the declarations is mis-\ntaken.  The first declaration they cite asserts that Cali-\nfornia\u2019s \u201coriginal waiver request\u201d in 2013 observed that \nthe State \u201caims to reduce emissions through \u2018reductions \nin fuel production.\u2019\u200a\u201d  C.A. Pet. Standing Decl. of Jen-\nnifer M. Swenton at 5-6 (citation omitted).  But that \n2013 statement says nothing about whether\u2014following \nthe years of \u201cinvestments [automakers] had already \nmade in updating their fleets and growing consumer de-\nmand for electric vehicles,\u201d Pet. App. 14a\u2014automakers \nwould still alter their production lines to manufacture \nmore gasoline-fueled cars if EPA\u2019s 2013 waiver were va-\ncated more than a decade later.  Petitioners also cite a \ndeclaration from a California Air Resources Board offi-\ncial stating that, \u201call else being equal,\u201d \u201cit is reasonable \nto expect that\u201d without the waiver \u201cthere would be  * * *  \nadditional gasoline-fueled vehicles produced and sold \nduring these model years.\u201d  C.A. Decl. of Sylvia Vander-\nspek at 11.  But that statement is not accompanied by \nany supporting evidence or explanation, and it conflicts \nwith automakers\u2019 own representations.          \nPetitioners further assert (Pet. 20) that \u201cthe court of \nappeals appeared to require plaintiffs to obtain affida-\nvits from the directly regulated parties\u2014here, the au-\ntomakers.\u201d  But while such affidavits would be one way \nfor petitioners to substantiate their theory of redressa-\nbility, the court below did not suggest that it is the only \nway.  Instead, the court simply noted petitioners\u2019 failure \nto produce any form of evidence indicating that au-\ntomakers would change their conduct in response to a \njudicial ruling in petitioners\u2019 favor.   \nFinally, petitioners\u2019 reliance (Pet. 17, 20) on this \nCourt\u2019s decision in Department of Commerce v. New \nYork, 588 U.S. 752 (2019), is misplaced.  There, the \n\n16 \n \nCourt held that the plaintiff States had standing to chal-\nlenge the government\u2019s reinstatement of a citizenship \nquestion on the census because that action would have \n\u201cresult[ed] in noncitizen households responding to the \ncensus at lower rates than other groups, which in turn \nwould cause them to be undercounted and lead\u201d their \nStates to lose federal funds.  Id. at 767.  The Court held \nthat the States had \u201cmet their burden of showing,\u201d in-\ncluding through historical evidence presented \u201cat trial,\u201d \nthat third-party noncitizens \u201cwill likely react in predict-\nable ways to the citizenship question.\u201d  Id. at 768.  Here, \nby contrast, petitioners presented no record evidence \nthat third-party automakers would react to vacatur of \nEPA\u2019s waiver by altering their fleets or pricing.  Pet. \nApp. 24a-25a.  Department of Commerce therefore does \nnot support petitioners\u2019 position.  \n2. a. Petitioners\u2019 assertion of a circuit conflict (Pet. \n21-24) is misconceived.  None of the decisions they cite \ninvolved record evidence affirmatively indicating that \nindependent third parties would likely not alter their \nconduct if the plaintiffs succeeded on the merits.  Peti-\ntioners identify no decision suggesting that \u201ccommon-\nsense inferences\u201d about third-party conduct (Pet. 24) \nare sufficient even in the face of such evidence.     \nIn NRDC v. NHTSA, 894 F.3d 95 (2018), the Second \nCircuit held that certain environmental groups had \nstanding to challenge an agency\u2019s indefinite delay of a \nrule that \u201cwould have increased civil penalties for viola-\ntions of\u200a\u201d fuel-economy standards.  Id. at 100.  In finding \nredressability, the court emphasized that, \u201cby automak-\ners\u2019 own admission, the increased penalty has the po-\ntential to affect [their] business decisions and compli-\nance approaches.\u201d  Id. at 105.  Here, by contrast, au-\ntomakers\u2019 public statements and actions suggest that \n\n17 \n \nthey would not change their business decisions and \ncompliance approaches even if EPA\u2019s waiver were va-\ncated. \nIn General Land Office v. Biden, 71 F.4th 264 (2023), \nthe Fifth Circuit held that States had standing to chal-\nlenge an agency\u2019s decision to divert funds away from the \nconstruction of a border wall.  Id. at 272-274.  But in \nconcluding that the States\u2019 asserted injuries were re-\ndressable, the court relied heavily on \u201cthe procedural \nposture of a motion to dismiss,\u201d which meant that the \nStates could rely solely on \u201callegations\u201d and were \u201cnot \nyet obliged to produce specific evidence.\u201d  Id. at 274.  By \ncontrast, the procedural posture here\u2014a petition for re-\nview of agency action on a full administrative record\u2014\ndoes require petitioners to produce evidence supporting \nredressability.  See Pet. App. 18a; cf. Defenders of Wild-\nlife, 504 U.S. at 563 (explaining that \u201ceach element [of \nstanding] must be supported in the same way as any \nother matter on which the plaintiff bears the burden of \nproof, i.e., with the manner and degree of evidence re-\nquired at the successive stages of the litigation\u201d).    \nIn Wieland v. HHS, 793 F.3d 949 (8th Cir. 2015), and \nSkyline Wesleyan Church v. California Department of \nManaged Health Care, 968 F.3d 738 (9th Cir. 2020), the \ncourts of appeals considered challenges to laws that had \ncaused insurers to refuse to offer certain plans that \nwould have comported with the plaintiffs\u2019 religious be-\nliefs.  See Skyline Wesleyan, 968 F.3d at 742; Wieland, \n793 F.3d at 951-952.  Both courts found that the plain-\ntiffs\u2019 conscience-based injuries were redressable, be-\ncause \u201cinsurers had previously offered plans that were \nacceptable to [the plaintiffs]\u201d before the challenged \nlaws were enacted and would \u201cpredictabl[y]\u201d do so again \nif those laws were invalidated.  Skyline Wesleyan, 968 \n\n18 \n \nF.3d at 750; see Wieland, 793 F.3d at 957.  But neither \nof those cases involved record evidence suggesting that \nmarket forces would make it unlikely for insurers to \nchange their products.   \nb. Petitioners also assert (Pet. 23-24) an intra-cir-\ncuit conflict with the D.C. Circuit\u2019s decision in Energy \nFuture Coalition v. EPA, 793 F.3d 141 (2015).  As an \ninitial matter, any resolution of an intra-circuit disa-\ngreement would be the task of the court of appeals, not \nthis Court.  See Wisniewski v. United States, 353 U.S. \n901, 901-902 (1957) (per curiam).  And petitioners de-\nclined to seek rehearing en banc in this case. \nIn any event, Energy Future Coalition differs mean-\ningfully from this case.  There, biofuel producers sued \nEPA, asserting that an EPA regulation prevented an \nethanol-based fuel from being \u201cuse[d] as a test fuel\u201d by \nvehicle manufacturers.  Energy Future Coalition, 793 \nF.3d at 143.  The court concluded that the biofuel pro-\nducers had standing because \u201cif EPA permitted vehicle \nmanufacturers to use [the ethanol-based fuel] as a test \nfuel, there is substantial reason to think that at least \nsome vehicle manufacturers would use it.\u201d  Id. at 144.  \nIn support of that conclusion, the court cited comments \nfrom Ford Motor Company \u201csaying that it \u2018supports the \ndevelopment and introduction\u2019\u200a\u201d of an ethanol-based \nfuel and \u201cthat the \u2018development of such a fuel would en-\nable the first steps to the development of a new genera-\ntion of highly efficient internal combustion engine vehi-\ncles.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Ibid. (citation omitted).  Here, the court of ap-\npeals cited automaker comments saying essentially the \nopposite:  That automakers would likely not produce \nmore gasoline-fueled vehicles, even if EPA\u2019s 2013 \nwaiver was vacated.   \n\n19 \n \nc. Finally, petitioners substantially overstate (Pet. \n24-25) the importance of the first question presented.  \nThe court of appeals did not suggest that plaintiffs can \nnever base standing on \u201ccommon-sense inferences \nabout how third parties behave in response to legal bar-\nriers to certain behavior.\u201d  Pet. 24.  Nor did it suggest \nthat parties who are not themselves the subject of a \nchallenged regulation \u201cmust secure the cooperation of a \ndirectly regulated party to establish standing.\u201d  Pet. 25. \nInstead, the court of appeals simply held that, where \nredressability depends on the prospect that a favorable \njudicial ruling will induce independent third parties to \nchange their conduct, and the only pertinent record ev-\nidence shows that those third parties likely will not do \nso, the plaintiff has not satisfied Article III.  The court\u2019s \nredressability holding turned substantially on distinc-\ntive characteristics of the automobile-manufacturing in-\ndustry and the many steps automakers had already \ntaken over several years to comply with\u2014and exceed\u2014\nCalifornia\u2019s standards.  See Pet. App. 23a-24a, 28a.  The \nconsequences of that holding are unlikely to be wide-\nspread. \nB. This Court Should Not Grant Certiorari On A Novel \nStatutory Issue That No Court Has Addressed \nPetitioners ask (Pet. 26-37) this Court to grant certi-\norari not only to review the redressability issue that the \ncourt of appeals decided, but also to resolve the merits \nof their statutory challenge\u2014which neither the court \nbelow nor any other court has addressed.  The Court \nshould reject that request.  This case is an extremely \npoor vehicle for deciding petitioners\u2019 statutory claim, \nand that claim lacks merit in any event.        \n \n1. a. If this Court granted certiorari on the second \nquestion presented, it could not decide that issue on the \n\n20 \n \nmerits unless it first reviewed and rejected the court of \nappeals\u2019 determination that petitioners lack Article III \nstanding.  See Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better Env\u2019t, \n523 U.S. 83, 94 (1998); pp. 11-16, supra.  In addition, \nEPA has raised another threshold argument that could \nimpede the Court\u2019s review of petitioners\u2019 statutory ar-\ngument:  namely, that EPA\u2019s 2019 decision to withdraw \nthe 2013 waiver was procedurally invalid because it re-\nopened a long-settled adjudication and relied on im-\nproper considerations.  See EPA C.A. Br. 53-58; 87 Fed. \nReg. at 14,344-14,352.  That argument is logically ante-\ncedent to the question whether the reinstatement deci-\nsion properly applies Section 209(b).       \nEven if the Court ultimately concluded that neither \nof those threshold obstacles bars its review of the sec-\nond question presented, a grant of certiorari on that is-\nsue would be contrary to the Court\u2019s usual practice.  \nThis Court ordinarily does not decide merits questions \n\u201cin the first instance\u201d where, as here, the court of ap-\npeals has resolved a case on threshold grounds.  Zivo-\ntofsky v. Clinton, 566 U.S. 189, 201 (2012) (citation omit-\nted).  Instead, when the Court \u201creverse[s] on a thresh-\nold question, [it] typically remand[s] for resolution of \nany claims the lower courts\u2019 error prevented them from \naddressing.\u201d  Ibid.; see, e.g., Bond v. United States, 564 \nU.S. 211, 214 (2011).    \nThat approach would make particular sense here be-\ncause the Court would otherwise be \u201cwithout the benefit \nof\u201d any \u201clower court opinions to guide [its] analysis of \nthe merits.\u201d  Zivotofsky, 566 U.S. at 201.  Indeed, no \ncourt has ever passed on the statutory question raised \nby petitioners.  The fact that this Court would be \u201cthe \nfirst to address the [second] question[] presented\u201d thus \nweighs against review.  Does 1-3 v. Mills, 142 S. Ct. 17, \n\n21 \n \n18 (2021) (Barrett, J., concurring in the denial of appli-\ncation for injunctive relief).       \nFinally, this Court\u2019s resolution of the second ques-\ntion presented would not be outcome-determinative in \nthe circumstances of this case.  Petitioners argue that \nEPA must apply Section 209(b) by evaluating whether \neach individual California emission-reduction standard \nfor which the State has sought a waiver is needed to ad-\ndress \u201cCalifornia\u2019s distinctive local pollution problems.\u201d  \nPet. 28; see Pet. 27-34.  That argument lacks merit, as \nexplained below.  But even if petitioners\u2019 interpretation \nof Section 209(b) were correct, EPA independently de-\ntermined that California\u2019s low-emission-vehicle and \nzero-emission-vehicle standards qualified for waivers \nunder that interpretation.  See 87 Fed. Reg. at 14,334 \n(\u201c[E]ven if the focus is on [California\u2019s] specific stand-\nards, when looking at the record before it, EPA erred \nin [2019] in concluding that California does not have a \ncompelling need for the specific standards at issue.\u201d).  \nIn its 2022 decision to reinstate the 2013 waiver, \nEPA found \u201cthat California is particularly impacted by \nclimate change, including increasing risks from record-\nsetting fires, heat waves, storm surges, sea-level rise, \nwater supply shortages and extreme heat.\u201d  87 Fed. \nReg. at 14,363.  And EPA determined that California \n\u201cneeds\u201d both the low-emission-vehicle and zero-emis-\nsion-vehicle standards to address the \u201ccompelling and \nextraordinary\u201d \u201cclimate-change impacts\u201d that it faces.  \nIbid.  In addition, EPA found that California faces \u201cse-\nrious criteria air pollution problems\u201d and that the zero-\nemission-vehicle standard directly reduces \u201ccriteria \npollutant concentrations in California\u201d by increasing \nthe share of vehicles that produce no criteria pollutants \nwhatsoever.  Id. at 14,363-14,364.  Indeed, California\u2019s \n\n22 \n \nvehicle program has included a zero-emission-vehicle \nstandard since 1990 for precisely that reason.  See id. at \n14,363.  Accordingly, EPA concluded that California\u2019s \nlow-emission-vehicle and zero-emission-vehicle stand-\nards were \u201cparticularly relevant\u201d to reducing \u201cCalifor-\nnia\u2019s air pollution problems.\u201d  Id. at 14,366. \nb. Petitioners ask (Pet. 36) this Court to ignore all of \nthe foregoing jurisdictional and prudential obstacles be-\ncause they contend that the second question presented \n\u201chas for too long evaded this Court\u2019s review,\u201d and that \n\u201c[t]he challenged waiver is in effect only through model \nyear 2025.\u201d  But if petitioners are correct that the chal-\nlenged waiver meaningfully affects their operations \nonly through model-year 2025, then that only further \nconfirms that this Court\u2019s intervention can do little to \nbenefit them.  If this Court granted certiorari on both \nquestions presented and ultimately held that petition-\ners have standing, it likely would not issue a merits de-\ncision until spring or summer of 2025, when model-year \n2026 cars will already be on the road.  See 40 C.F.R. \n85.2304(a) (establishing that the model year may begin \n\u201con January 2 of the calendar year preceding the year \nfor which the model year is designated,\u201d i.e., on January \n2, 2025, for model year 2026); 40 C.F.R. 85.2305(a). \nNor is there any reason to think that the statutory \nissue presented will necessarily evade judicial review.  \nNumerous Section 209(b) waivers have been reviewed \nby courts on the merits.  See, e.g., American Trucking \nAss\u2019ns v. EPA, 600 F.3d 624, 627-629 (D.C. Cir. 2010); \nMotor & Equip. Mfrs. Ass\u2019n v. Nichols, 142 F.3d 449, \n462-464 (D.C. Cir. 1998).  Indeed, the precise issue of \nstatutory interpretation that petitioners raise here is \ncurrently pending before the D.C. Circuit in a case aris-\ning from EPA\u2019s 2023 waiver for California\u2019s standards \n\n23 \n \ngoverning heavy-duty vehicles and engines.  See Private \nPet. Br. 39-58, Western States Trucking Assoc., Inc. v. \nEPA, No. 23-1143 (D.C. Cir. Nov. 3, 2023); 88 Fed. Reg. \n20,688, 20,688 (Apr. 6, 2023).  That waiver applies to Cal-\nifornia standards that govern through model-year 2035 \nand beyond, see Cal. Code Regs. tit. 13, \u00a7 1963.1 (2024), \nso the challenge there will not be affected by any issues \nconcerning the duration of the waiver.2   \nMoreover, the alleged urgency here results in part \nfrom petitioners\u2019 own litigation decisions.  Petitioners \ndid not challenge EPA\u2019s 2013 waiver in 2013, when there \nwas ample time to obtain a judicial decision before \nmodel-year 2025.  Instead, they challenged only EPA\u2019s \n2022 reinstatement of the 2013 waiver, by which time \nmodel-year 2025 was fast approaching.  And once they \nfiled their challenge in the D.C. Circuit, they litigated \non a normal timeline, without seeking expedition.  Peti-\ntioners also suggest (Pet. 35-36) that granting review \nnow is necessary because California has adopted new \nstandards applicable to passenger vehicles for future \nmodel years.  But if EPA grants California a waiver for \nthose new standards\u2014which EPA has not yet done\u2014\npetitioners can challenge the waiver at that time. \n2. a. In any event, petitioners\u2019 statutory argument \nlacks merit.  Section 209(b) provides that EPA gener-\nally \u201cshall\u201d grant California a preemption waiver \u201cif the \nState determines that the State standards will be, in  \nthe aggregate, at least as protective of public health  \nand welfare as applicable Federal standards.\u201d  42 \nU.S.C. 7543(b)(1).  Section 209(b) further specifies, \n \n2 The D.C. Circuit has held Western States Trucking in abeyance \npending the court\u2019s resolution of Texas v. EPA, No. 22-1031 (argued \nSept. 14, 2023).  See Western States Trucking, supra, No. 23-1143 \n(Dec. 21, 2023).      \n\n24 \n \nhowever, that \u201c[n]o such waiver shall be granted if the \nAdministrator finds that,\u201d inter alia, \u201csuch State does \nnot need such State standards to meet compelling and \nextraordinary conditions.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 7543(b)(1)(B).   \nIn its 2022 reinstatement decision, EPA concluded \nthat California\u2019s 2012 waiver request had been properly \ngranted in 2013 pursuant to Section 209(b)\u2019s criteria.  \nSee 87 Fed. Reg. at 14,358-14,361; see also 78 Fed. Reg. \nat 2113.  In reaching that conclusion, EPA affirmed that \nthe 2013 waiver grant had correctly considered Califor-\nnia\u2019s standards in the aggregate, as EPA has consist-\nently done in waiver decisions across the last five dec-\nades.  See 87 Fed. Reg. at 14,353-14,354 (discussing this \ntraditional practice); cf. Motor & Equipment Mfrs. \nAss\u2019n, 142 F.3d at 464 (agreeing with EPA that, for pur-\nposes of Section 209(b)(1)(C), \u201cCalifornia\u2019s consistency \nis to be evaluated \u2018in the aggregate,\u2019 rather than on a \none-to-one basis\u201d) (citation omitted).   \nSection 209(b)(1) requires California to base its pro-\ntectiveness determination on its \u201cstandards  * * *  in  \nthe aggregate.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 7543(b)(1).  Subparagraph \n(b)(1)(B)\u2019s directive that EPA must consider whether \n\u201csuch State standards\u201d are needed \u201cto meet compelling \nand extraordinary conditions,\u201d 42 U.S.C. 7543(b)(1)(B) \n(emphasis added), therefore is likewise best understood \nto refer to the standards in the aggregate.  See Slack \nTechs., LLC v. Pirani, 598 U.S. 759, 766 (2023) (\u201cThe \nword \u2018such\u2019 usually refers to something that has already \nbeen \u2018described\u2019 or that is \u2018implied or intelligible from \nthe context or circumstances.\u2019\u200a\u201d) (citation omitted).  Be-\ncause the state standards just mentioned in paragraph \n(b)(1) have an aggregate character, \u201csuch State stand-\nards\u201d in subparagraph (b)(1)(B) have the same aggre-\ngate character.  Although petitioners contend that \n\n25 \n \n\u201cSection 209(b)\u2019s \u2018in the aggregate\u2019 language does not \ncarry down to the rest of 209(b),\u201d Pet. 32 (emphasis \nomitted), petitioners disregard the word \u201csuch,\u201d whose \nusual purpose is to make clear that such a connection \nexists. \nPetitioners further contend (Pet. 32) that EPA\u2019s ag-\ngregate approach to subparagraph (b)(1)(B) is incon-\nsistent with its approach to subparagraph (b)(1)(C).  \nBut petitioners\u2019 premise is wrong:  As EPA explained, \nit interprets subparagraph (b)(1)(C) to also \u201crefer to \nstandards in the aggregate.\u201d  87 Fed. Reg. at 14,361; see \nid. at 14,361 n.266 (explaining that EPA has evaluated \nCalifornia\u2019s \u201csuite of standards\u201d and that \u201cEPA\u2019s as-\nsessment under 209(b)(1)(C) is not in practice a stand-\nard-by-standard review\u201d); Motor & Equip. Mfrs. Ass\u2019n, \n142 F.3d at 464. \nPetitioners also advance a highly restrictive reading \nof other terms in subparagraph (b)(1)(B)\u2014like \u201c\u200a\u2018ex-\ntraordinary\u2019\u200a\u201d and \u201cneed\u201d\u2014contending that the provi-\nsion only permits standards that are \u201cessential\u201d to \nmeeting \u201cCalifornia\u2019s distinctive local pollution prob-\nlems.\u201d  Pet. 28, 31.  But that argument presupposes that \nCalifornia\u2019s standards must be evaluated individually \nrather than in the aggregate.  Petitioners appear to \nacknowledge (Pet. 32) that, if \u201cEPA\u2019s whole-program \napproach\u201d is valid, then subparagraph (b)(1)(B) is satis-\nfied even under their reading of \u201c\u200a\u2018extraordinary\u2019\u200a\u201d and \n\u201c\u200a\u2018need[].\u2019\u200a\u201d \nb. Section 209(b)\u2019s history reinforces EPA\u2019s aggre-\ngate approach.  As noted above, see p. 3, supra, the 1967 \nversion of the CAA required California\u2019s standards to \nbe \u201cmore stringent than applicable Federal standards.\u201d  \n\u00a7 208(b), 81 Stat. 501.  As amended in 1977, however, the \nstatute requires California to determine only that its \n\n26 \n \nstandards \u201cin the aggregate\u201d will be at least as protec-\ntive as federal standards.  \u00a7\u202f207, 91 Stat. 755.  That 1977 \namendment ensured that California had flexibility to \nadopt an appropriate program of \u201cemission control \nstandards,\u201d \u201ceven if those standards were in some re-\nspects less stringent than comparable federal ones.\u201d  \nMotor & Equip. Mfrs. Ass\u2019n, 142 F.3d at 464 (citation \nomitted).  As EPA recognized 40 years ago, Congress \nwould \u201cnot have given this flexibility to California and \nsimultaneously assigned to the state the seemingly im-\npossible task of establishing that \u2018extraordinary and \ncompelling conditions\u2019 exist for each less stringent \nstandard.\u201d  49 Fed. Reg. 18,887, 18,890 n.24 (May 3, \n1984). \nc. Petitioners\u2019 reliance (Pet. 33) on various \u201cclear-\nstatement rules\u201d is misplaced.  As the government\u2019s \nbrief in opposition in Ohio v. EPA, petition for cert. \npending, 24-13 (filed July 5, 2024), explains, Section \n209(b) raises no serious issue under the equal-sover-\neignty principle.  And because the petitioners in Ohio v. \nEPA argue that Congress is categorically foreclosed \nfrom subjecting different States\u2019 laws to different \npreemption standards, their approach would render \nSection 209(b) unconstitutional under either a whole-\nprogram or a standard-by-standard interpretation.  The \nconstitutional-avoidance canon therefore has no evident \nrole to play here. \nThe major-questions doctrine is likewise inapplica-\nble.  Contrary to petitioners\u2019 implication (Pet. 34), eco-\nnomic consequences standing alone have never been \nenough to trigger the major-questions doctrine.  After \nall, the doctrine is a tool for discerning \u201cthe text\u2019s most \nnatural interpretation\u201d by situating the text in \u201ccon-\ntext.\u201d  Biden v. Nebraska, 600 U.S. 477, 508 (2023) \n\n27 \n \n(Barrett, J., concurring).  So in deciding whether the \ndoctrine applies, this Court has considered not just the \n\u201ceconomic and political significance\u201d of the asserted au-\nthority, but also other surrounding circumstances, such \nas the \u201chistory and the breadth of th[at] authority.\u201d  \nWest Virginia v. EPA, 597 U.S. 697, 721 (2022) (citation \nomitted); see, e.g., Nebraska, 600 U.S. at 501 (same). \nHere, neither the history nor the breadth of the pro-\nvision at issue \u201cprovide[s] a \u2018reason to hesitate.\u2019\u200a\u201d  West \nVirginia, 597 U.S. at 721 (citation omitted).  Indeed, un-\nlike the federal statutory provisions at issue in West \nVirginia and Nebraska, the waiver provision does not \n\u201cconfer[] authority upon an administrative agency\u201d to \nmake \u201c\u200a\u2018major policy decisions.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Id. at 721, 723 (citation \nomitted).  Rather, it requires EPA to adjudicate waiver \nrequests and confines EPA\u2019s discretion to determining \nwhether specified criteria are met.  And while the  \nmajor-questions doctrine is designed in part to \u201cpre-\nserve room for lawmaking\u201d by state and local govern-\nments, id. at 739 (Gorsuch, J., concurring), restricting \nthe availability of Section 209(b) waivers (as petitioners \nrequest) would curb state power and expand federal \npower.  \nPetitioners\u2019 invocation (Pet. 34) of the federalism \ncanon is even further afield.  Petitioners contend (Pet. \n34) that, \u201cunder EPA\u2019s view, California alone among the \nStates can regulate the nation\u2019s automobile market in \nthe service of addressing climate change and forcing a \ntransition to electric vehicles.\u201d  Petitioners\u2019 proposed \nconstruction of Section 209(b), however, would not ex-\npand state regulatory authority in this sphere.  To the \ncontrary, adopting that interpretation would make it \nmore difficult for California to obtain preemption waiv-\ners, and it would correspondingly reduce other States\u2019 \n\n28 \n \npractical ability to choose between California and fed-\neral vehicle-emission standards.  Petitioners\u2019 invocation \nof the federalism canon as a ground for constraining \nstate regulatory authority would thus flip the canon on \nits head.  \nCONCLUSION \nThe petition for a writ of certiorari should be denied. \nRespectfully submitted. \n \n \nELIZABETH B.

          "task_beliefs": "My understanding of this case continues to be refined, moving from a general overview to a detailed map of the legal arguments. My knowledge is currently built upon the petitioners' framing in their Petition for a Writ of Certiorari.\n\nThe core of the case involves a coalition of fuel producers and agricultural groups challenging the EPA's reinstatement of California's Clean Air Act waiver. The petitioners present two primary questions for the Court:\n\n1.  **Article III Standing (Redressability):** The central procedural question is whether the D.C. Circuit erred in dismissing the case. The petitioners argue that the lower court created an impossibly high standard for redressability by requiring direct evidence (like affidavits) from automakers (the regulated third parties) stating they would change their behavior if the waiver were vacated. They contend that under precedents like *Bennett v. Spear*, the predictable economic effect of a regulation\u2014in this case, reduced demand for gasoline\u2014is sufficient to show that vacating the rule would redress their injury. A significant complicating factor, which I must keep in mind, is that several major automakers have intervened to *defend* the EPA's waiver, which seems to contradict the petitioners' argument about predictable effects.\n\n2.  **The Merits (Legality of the Waiver):** The petitioners are not just seeking a remand on standing; they want the Supreme Court to rule on the merits. Their arguments are:\n    *   **Textual:** Global climate change is not a \"compelling and extraordinary condition\" *within California*, as specified by the Clean Air Act, because it is a global, not local, problem.\n    *   **Causation:** California does not \"need\" its own standards to \"meet\" the challenge of climate change, as a single state's rules will have no discernible effect on a global phenomenon.\n    *   **Structural/Major Questions Doctrine:** Invoking *West Virginia v. EPA*, they argue Congress did not clearly authorize the EPA to allow a single state to set de facto national policy on an issue of such vast economic and political importance.\n\nMy most recent observation, which was an internal reasoning step, did not introduce new external facts but critically clarified my knowledge state. It confirmed that my understanding is currently one-sided, based entirely on the petitioners' perspective. The most significant gap in my knowledge is the respondents' counterarguments. To make an accurate prediction, I must understand how the EPA, California, and their allies (including the automakers) will defend the D.C. Circuit's standing analysis and the legality of the waiver itself. My analysis is therefore primed to receive and integrate the arguments from the Brief in Opposition.",
          "design_beliefs": "My meta-level understanding of effective legal analysis for Supreme Court prediction has been significantly strengthened and validated through a cycle of action and reflection.\n\nMy initial heuristic\u2014to begin by analyzing the **Petition for a Writ of Certiorari**\u2014has proven to be the most effective opening move. This single document provided the specific legal questions, the strategic framing of the arguments, the key precedents cited, and a map of the stakeholder coalitions. This success has led to a more sophisticated and confirmed research methodology:\n\n1.  **Prioritize the \"Questions Presented\":** This section of the cert petition remains the highest-value target for quickly understanding the core legal issues.\n2.  **Analyze the \"Parties to the Proceeding\":** Mapping the coalitions (fuel/ag vs. government/automakers/enviros) is a powerful heuristic for understanding the economic and political stakes and anticipating strategic complexities, such as the regulated parties defending the regulation.\n3.  **Recognize Dual-Pronged Petitions:** Identifying that petitioners are seeking a ruling on both procedure (standing) and the merits is a key insight into their strategy and perceived urgency.\n4.  **Confirm the Research Workflow:** My planned workflow of **Cert Petition \u2192 Brief in Opposition \u2192 Amicus Briefs/Precedent Research** is now validated as a logical and efficient path to building a comprehensive, multi-faceted understanding of a case. The cert petition provides the direct pointers for the subsequent steps.\n5.  **Formalize Metacognitive Assessment:** The latest observation, a `THINK` action, demonstrates the value of pausing to perform a metacognitive assessment. A new, crucial heuristic is to **explicitly identify the primary knowledge gap** after processing a major source of information. This step transforms passive information gathering into a targeted, efficient search for the next most valuable piece of evidence, directly embodying the principle of Optimal Experimental Design. In this instance, it correctly identified the respondents' arguments in the Brief in Opposition as the necessary next target to balance my one-sided understanding. This structured reflection is essential for building a robust and unbiased view."

          "task_beliefs": "My understanding of this case has now evolved from a one-sided view based on the petitioners' arguments to a more balanced, dialectical perspective incorporating the federal government's defense. The Brief for the Federal Respondents in Opposition, filed by the Solicitor General, provides the direct counter-narrative I was missing.\n\n1.  **Article III Standing (Redressability):** My initial assessment of this as a weak point for the petitioners is now strongly supported by the government's specific arguments.\n    *   **The Government's Position:** The respondents argue that the D.C. Circuit's decision was a correct, fact-bound application of established standing principles, not a creation of a new, higher standard. They contend that any injury to the fuel producers is not redressable by vacating the waiver for several key reasons:\n        *   **Third-Party Actions:** Redress depends entirely on the \"guesswork\" of how independent automakers will behave, a theory of standing the Supreme Court has recently been reluctant to endorse (citing *Murthy v. Missouri* and *Haaland v. Brackeen*).\n        *   **Market Realities:** Automakers have already made massive investments to comply with the standards since 2013. Furthermore, they are motivated by their own sustainability goals and consumer demand, irrespective of the waiver. The fact that several automakers entered voluntary agreements with California *after* the 2019 waiver withdrawal is powerful evidence of this.\n        *   **Timing and Lead Time:** The challenged waiver only extends through Model Year 2025. The government argues, citing automaker comments in the record, that manufacturing lead times are so long that it's not substantially likely that car companies would or could alter their production mix in time to affect fuel demand, even if the waiver were vacated.\n    *   **My Updated Analysis:** The government's arguments significantly weaken the petitioners' reliance on *Bennett v. Spear*. The government isn't overturning *Bennett*, but arguing that the *facts* here\u2014the independent market motivations and long lead times of the automakers\u2014make the chain of causation too speculative. My prediction on the standing question now leans heavily in favor of the government's position that the Court will see this as a poor case for review on this issue.\n\n2.  **The Merits (Legality of the Waiver):** The government's primary strategy here is avoidance, arguing the Court should not reach the merits at all.\n    *   **The Government's Position:** They present a classic \"vehicle problem\" argument. They urge the Court to deny certiorari on the merits because it is a \"novel statutory issue that no court has addressed.\" They argue the Supreme Court should act as a \"Court of review, not of first view.\" This position is strengthened by their claim that the same statutory issue is currently pending before the D.C. Circuit in a separate case, allowing the issue to \"percolate\" further in the lower courts.\n    *   **Countering the Petitioners' Merits Arguments:** While urging avoidance, the government also lays the groundwork for its defense on the merits. They reframe the history of the Clean Air Act, emphasizing that Congress intentionally created a special role for California due to its unique pollution problems and leadership in emissions control. They highlight the 1977 amendments, which broadened California's flexibility by only requiring its standards to be \"in the aggregate, at least as protective\" as federal ones. This historical and textual context directly counters the petitioners' narrow reading of \"compelling and extraordinary conditions\" and their claim that California cannot address a global problem.\n    *   **My Updated Analysis:** The government's procedural argument against hearing the merits is very strong and is a common reason for cert denial. It gives the Justices an \"off-ramp\" to avoid a contentious environmental policy dispute. My overall confidence that the Supreme Court will *deny* the petition for certiorari has increased substantially. The petitioners now face a two-level barrier: a fact-specific standing problem and a strong procedural argument to let the issue develop further in lower courts.",
          "design_beliefs": "My meta-level understanding of effective Supreme Court prediction continues to be refined and validated. This observation solidifies my core methodology and adds crucial new heuristics.\n\n1.  **Prioritize the \"Questions Presented\":** This remains the best starting point.\n2.  **Analyze the \"Parties to the Proceeding\":** Mapping coalitions continues to be a high-value heuristic.\n3.  **Recognize Dual-Pronged Petitions:** Identifying both procedural and merits arguments is key.\n4.  **Confirm the Research Workflow:** The sequence of **Cert Petition \u2192 Brief in Opposition \u2192 Amicus Briefs/Precedent Research** is definitively the most efficient path. The Brief in Opposition was the perfect \"experimental design\" choice, as it directly targeted and filled the precise knowledge gap identified in my previous self-assessment.\n5.  **Formalize Metacognitive Assessment:** The practice of pausing to explicitly identify the primary knowledge gap after processing a major source is now a core part of my methodology. It ensures targeted, rather than scattershot, information gathering.\n6.  **New Heuristic - The \"Vehicle Problem\":** I have now learned to actively screen for \"vehicle problems\" when analyzing a respondent's brief. The government's argument that the Court should not act as a \"court of first view\" and should let the issue \"percolate\" is a classic and powerful reason for cert denial. This is a critical pattern to recognize in future cases.\n7.  **New Heuristic - The Power of Framing:** This observation highlighted the strategic importance of how each side frames the \"Questions Presented.\" The petitioners frame the case as involving a grave legal error of national importance. The government frames it as a routine, fact-bound dispute and a novel issue not yet ripe for review. Comparing these frames is a powerful shortcut to understanding each side's core strategy for persuading the Court to either grant or deny review.\n8.  **Refined Heuristic - Source Weighting:** I must assign special weight to the arguments made in a brief filed by the U.S. Solicitor General. The SG's office is highly respected by the Court, and its views on whether a case warrants review (cert-worthiness) are particularly influential. This is not just another party's brief; it's a signal from a key institutional player."

No one disputes that, starting in 2013, \nCalifornia\u2019s standards forced automakers to produce far \nmore vehicles that use no or less liquid fuel.  No one dis-\nputes that, in reinstating those standards in 2022, both \nCalifornia and EPA said the standards were critical to de-\ncreasing the emissions that result from using liquid fuel.  \nNo one disputes that the parties have vigorously fought \nover the lawfulness of California\u2019s standards for the last \nthree years.  No one disputes that some automakers in-\ntervened here out of concern that vacating the waiver \nwould advantage competitors less invested in electric \nvehicles.  Nor does anyone dispute\u2014indeed, the United \n\n2 \n \nStates acknowledges\u2014that the President himself has \npublicly said that California\u2019s and EPA\u2019s actions have ar-\ntificially inflated the demand for electric vehicles and \nharmed consumers. \nEPA and California say only that petitioners had to \nand did not prove that California\u2019s standards matter to \nautomaker conduct by submitting sufficient evidence to \nthe court of appeals.  From the jump, respondents are \nwrong about the law.  Removing a coercive government \nstandard that cabins the use of a challenger\u2019s products \nprovides redress under Article III.  See Bennett v. \nSpear, 520 U.S. 154, 169 (1997).  Respondents reject \nthat straightforward legal rule.  They contend that if  \na regulatory target challenges a regulation that acts  \non a third party, it must \u201cprove\u201d redressability with \n\u201cevidence\u201d\u2014such as affidavits from \u201ceconomists,\u201d \nEPA Br. 43, 44, or facts from \u201csecurities and court fil-\nings,\u201d Cal. Br. 36\u2014showing how the third party will re-\nact to the coercive regulation, independent of market \nforces.  That rule is contrary to this Court\u2019s precedents \nand would lock indirectly regulated entities out of ad-\nministrative challenges, keeping unlawful government \nmandates on the books. \nEven if petitioners could not rely on the removal of \nCalifornia\u2019s coercive standards alone to establish re-\ndressability, respondents are still wrong.  Petitioners \ncould rely on the \u201cpredictable\u201d effects of electric- \nvehicle \nmandates \nand \ngreenhouse-gas \nemission  \nstandards\u2014namely, reducing the use of liquid fuels.  \nDepartment of Commerce v. New York, 588 U.S. 752, \n768 (2019).  Respondents contend that this is a unique \ncircumstance in which the market changed faster than \nexpected, outpacing the government regulations.  EPA \nBr. 31-35; Cal. Br. 17-22.  But respondents primarily \nrely on industry averages and certain automakers\u2019 \n\n3 \n \nplans\u2014which undercut rather than support the idea \nthat all automakers were irrevocably committed in \n2022 to meeting California\u2019s standards.  Respondents \nalso criticize petitioners for submitting \u201cno evidence\u201d \non redressability, EPA Br. 39; Cal. Br. 3, and then \nspend pages attacking that evidence in painstaking de-\ntail.  EPA Br. 35-38; Cal. Br. 45-48. \nAlong the way, neither EPA nor California fully de-\nfends the decision below.  All parties now agree that \nthe court of appeals mistakenly believed that the \nwaiver is of \u201crelatively short duration\u201d and expires in \n2025, Pet. App. 22a, when some of its standards in fact \nlast in perpetuity, EPA Br. 45; Cal. Br. 43-44.  Re-\nspondents are thus left to argue harmlessness.  They \nassert that a regulation that imposes an unlawful gov-\nernment mandate forever is unchallengeable if it tracks \ncurrent \u201cmarket forces\u201d when enacted.  E.g., Cal. Br. \n20-21; EPA Br. 16-17.  \u201c[I]f you find yourself in a place \nas absurd as that, you might want to consider whether \nyou\u2019ve taken a wrong turn along the way.\u201d  Kisor v. \nWilkie, 588 U.S. 558, 607 (2019) (Gorsuch, J., concur-\nring in the judgment).  It is simply incorrect that a \nmandate applicable to more than 40% of the Nation\u2019s \nnew vehicle market was unchallengeable from the day \nit was reinstated in 2022.  \nARGUMENT \nPETITIONERS\u2019 INJURIES ARE REDRESSABLE \nRespondents agree that this case turns on whether \npetitioners satisfied Article III\u2019s redressability compo-\nnent.  See Cal. Br. 14; EPA Br. 19.  First, they contend \nthat vacating a government regulation prohibiting or \nrestricting the sale of the challenger\u2019s products is in-\nsufficient to establish redressability.  That is wrong.  \nNext, they argue that, on the record here, these much-\n\n4 \nballyhooed and much-contested regulations were \npointless from the moment they were reinstated.  That \nis implausible.  Finally, they acknowledge that the \ncourt of appeals misunderstood the perpetual nature of \nthe waiver but contend that there is nothing petitioners \ncan do to challenge it, ever.  That is shocking.  This \nCourt should reject any one of respondents\u2019 arguments \nand reverse. \nA. Petitioners Have Established Redressability\nBecause They Are Challenging A Government\nRestriction On The Sale Of Their Products\nThe removal of the \u201cdeterminative or coercive ef-\nfect\u201d of California\u2019s standards on automakers is suffi-\ncient to establish redressability.  Bennett, 520 U.S. at \n169.\nRespondents mischaracterize this straightfor-\nward legal rule, and then attack it as inconsistent with\nprecedent and basic Article III principles.  They are\nmistaken on all fronts.\n1.\nRespondents first overstate the breadth of a\ncommonsense categorical rule.  As petitioners have ex-\nplained (at 25-28), a challenger establishes redressabil-\nity if a decision in its favor would remove a \u201cdirect reg-\nulatory impediment\u201d to its product\u2019s use.  Energy Fu-\nture Coal. v. EPA, 793 F.3d 141, 144 (D.C. Cir. 2015). \nThat rule need not extend to any \u201cregulation implicat-\ning the use of [a] product,\u201d Cal. Br. 31, or any \u201clegal \nimpediment to third-party conduct that would benefit \nthe plaintiff,\u201d EPA Br. 16.  Instead, petitioners\u2019 rule \nmerely simplifies an analysis that yields an obvious \nconclusion:  when the government tells automakers to \nmake more cars that use less fuel, there is \u201clittle ques-\ntion\u201d that fuel producers have standing to sue.  Energy \nFuture Coal., 793 F.3d at 144.  The same is true of pri-\nvate schools when the government forbids parents \nfrom sending their kids there, see Pierce v. Society of \n\n5 \n \nthe Sisters of the Holy Names of Jesus and Mary, \n268 U.S. 510, 534-536 (1925); of networks when the gov-\nernment tells broadcasters not to partner with them, \nsee CBS v. United States, 316 U.S. 407, 422-423 (1942); \nof muffler producers when EPA imposes \u201ca no-muffler \nmandate on vehicle manufacturers,\u201d API Br. 6; or of \nsoda manufacturers when the government prohibits re-\ntailers from selling jumbo-sized soft drinks, Chamber \nBr. 10. \nOr at least one would think.  California disagrees \nand offers (at 33-34) its own hypothetical that crystal-\nlizes this dispute.  Assume the FDA forbids soda mak-\ners from using sugar in more than 80% of their sodas, \nwith the express purpose of reducing sugar consump-\ntion.  Many soda makers do not feel strongly, as 30% of \ncurrent sodas on the market are already sugar-free.  \nBut sugar refiners certainly care\u2014they want to in-\ncrease their market share without government inter-\nference, or sell without limits to those soda makers that \nwould prefer to use more sugar than the average.  As \nCalifornia sees it, even if the cap on sugary beverages \nis patently unlawful, sugar refiners cannot sue\u2014and \nmay forever be time-barred from doing so\u2014because, \nfor now, the market average exceeds the illegal man-\ndate.  Redressability doctrine has never functioned \nthat way. \nAnd that is just the example California apparently \nsees as most favorable to its cause.  The absurdities of \nrespondents\u2019 position only get worse from there.  As-\nsume the FCC enacts a regulation prohibiting net-\nworks from airing football more than four nights a \nweek because Americans should diversify their tastes.  \nUnder respondents\u2019 rule, the NFL could not challenge \nthe regulation because networks currently air games \nonly three or four nights per week.  Similarly, Tesla \n\n6 \n \ncould not have challenged a law barring car dealers \nfrom devoting more than 5% of their lots to electric ve-\nhicles, so long as the electric-vehicle market was in its \ninfancy.  And if California required Starbucks to sell at \nleast 50% of its coffee to women because it wanted busi-\nnesses to be more female-friendly, men could not bring \nan equal-protection challenge if women are already \nhalf of Starbucks customers.   \nNone of this makes any sense.  Respondents\u2019 view \nof redressability fails to account for dynamic markets \nand the influence of government mandates.  It allows \nagencies to set unlawful regulatory floors during a \nmarket high, and\u2014with assistance from statutes of \nlimitations\u2014permanently insulate their illegal regula-\ntions from judicial review.  California\u2019s (at 19-22) and \nEPA\u2019s (at 32-34) discussions of \u201cmarket forces\u201d are \nthus irrelevant.  Even in the unlikely event that Cali-\nfornia\u2019s standards matched what market forces were \nproducing in 2022, but see pp. 15-17, infra, the regula-\ntions illegally locked into place a minimum market \nshare for electric and low-emission vehicles.1  Remov-\ning the waiver allows market forces to once again gov-\nern.  Fuel producers would be free to sell what the mar-\nket will bear.  At a minimum, they would have the abil-\nity to persuade automakers and consumers to shift \naway from electric vehicles through lower prices,  \n \n1 \nRespondents repeatedly fault petitioners for not challenging \nEPA\u2019s initial waiver in 2013.  See, e.g., Cal. Br. 18; EPA Br. 17.  As \nCalifornia acknowledges, however, D.C. Circuit precedent as of 2013 \nprecluded petitioners from challenging the waiver to the extent it ap-\nplied to California\u2019s greenhouse-gas standards.  See Chamber of \nCommerce v. EPA, 642 F.3d 192, 206 (D.C. Cir. 2011).  California \ncounters (at 18 n.7) that petitioners could have challenged Califor-\nnia\u2019s waiver for the zero-emission-vehicle mandate, but at the time \nthe two market constraints significantly overlapped.  See 78 Fed. \nReg. 2,112, 2,130-2,131 (Jan. 9, 2013).    \n\n7 \n \nimproved marketing, technological innovations, or  \notherwise\u2014just as the NFL, Tesla, and coffee drinkers \nwould remain free to shift others\u2019 market preferences. \n2. Respondents next try to distinguish this Court\u2019s \ncases establishing or applying the straightforward \nprinciple that the removal of a regulatory barrier to the \nuse of one\u2019s product establishes redressability.  But \nthey make each case far more complicated than this \nCourt saw it. \nIn Bennett, the Court held that an injury can be re-\ndressed by removing a \u201ccoercive\u201d government regula-\ntion that \u201calters the legal regime.\u201d  520 U.S. at 169.  \nEPA (at 25) and California (at 29) say that was not \nenough to establish standing in Bennett.  They note \nthat the Court also relied on evidence that the Bureau \nof Reclamation would have changed course if the Fish \nand Wildlife Service\u2019s biological opinion were vacated.  \nBut that misses the point of why the Court looked at \nthat evidence.  The government argued that the biolog-\nical opinion was merely \u201cadvisory\u201d and not actually \nbinding.  520 U.S. at 169.  The Court therefore had to \nask whether \u201cin reality it ha[d] a powerful coercive ef-\nfect\u201d on the Bureau.  Ibid.  Here, there is no question \nthat California\u2019s standards are legally binding on au-\ntomakers, and accordingly there is no need for a fur-\nther inquiry into what effects those standards have in \npractice.  Simply put, if the government had conceded \nin Bennett that the biological opinion was binding, \nthere would have been no doubt about standing. \nRegardless, even if Bennett did require something \nmore than the existence of \u201ccoercive\u201d government ac-\ntion, that something was far less than what respond-\nents demand here.  It was enough for the Bennett chal-\nlengers to allege that the Bureau had historically oper-\nated the dam \u201cin the same manner\u201d for a long time and \n\n8 \n \nthen changed its practice after the biological opinion, \nwhich \u201calter[ed] the legal regime to which the [Bureau] \nis subject.\u201d  520 U.S. at 169, 170.  All of that is true \nhere.  Automakers manufactured liquid-fuel-powered \nvehicles for a long time, until California\u2019s standards \nforced them to change.  Petitioners have thus \u201cmet \ntheir burden\u201d of showing that their injuries \u201cwill \n\u2018likely\u2019 be redressed,\u201d at least to some extent, by lifting \nCalifornia\u2019s standards.  Id. at 171. \nRespondents\u2019 attempts to distinguish this Court\u2019s \nother cases fare no better.  Respondents emphasize \nthat Pierce and CBS involved \u201cfactual allegations, of \nharms likely to be redressed.\u201d  EPA Br. 27; Cal. Br. 30.  \nBut in Pierce, this Court did not rely on \u201cfactual alle-\ngations\u201d of harm because the \u201cinevitable practical re-\nsult of enforcing the act\u201d\u2014criminalizing sending chil-\ndren to private schools\u2014would be \u201cdestruction of \u201d the \nchallenging private schools.  268 U.S. at 534, 536.  And \nin CBS, it was \u201cenough\u201d that the challenged \u201cregula-\ntions purport[ed] to operate to alter and affect ad-\nversely\u201d the challenging broadcast companies\u2019 \u201ccon-\ntractual rights and business relations with station own-\ners.\u201d  316 U.S. at 422.  Moreover, even if relevant, the \nbare allegations of harm in Pierce and CBS offered far \nless evidence of injury than petitioners supplied here \nin their declarations alone.  See J.A. 211.  EPA says (at \n26-27) this case is different because Pierce and CBS \nconcerned the \u201cplaintiff\u2019s business relationship with a \nthird party,\u201d while here there is \u201cnot any transaction \nbetween vehicle manufacturers and fuel producers.\u201d  \nThat ad hoc limit is irrelevant.  The key question is the \nlikely reaction of the directly regulated party. \nNor has the Court stopped with Bennett, Pierce, \nand CBS.  For example, this Court has recognized that \n\n9 \n \nbusinesses have standing to challenge actions that in-\ncrease competition for \u201cpersons who might otherwise \nbe their customers\u201d; they do not have to prove that \nthose potential customers will become actual custom-\ners.  National Credit Union Admin. v. First Nat\u2019l \nBank & Trust Co., 522 U.S. 479, 488 n.4 (1998).  EPA \nderides (at 42 n.2) this principle as confined to the \n\u201ccompetitor standing\u201d context.  That is yet another \nmade-up limit.  In any event, \u201c[s]uits where one busi-\nness challenges the under-regulation of another go well \nbeyond competitor suits.\u201d  Corner Post, Inc. v. Board \nof Governors of Fed. Resrv. Sys., 603 U.S. 799, 834 \n(2024) (Kavanaugh, J., concurring).   \nRespondents also fail to distinguish the most \non-point lower-court decision, Energy Future Coali-\ntion.  The court of appeals there held that biofuel pro-\nducers had standing to challenge \u201ca direct regulatory \nimpediment that prevent[ed]\u201d the use of biofuel.  \n793 F.3d at 144.  Respondents spin that holding as an \n\u201cobservation\u201d \u201cpremised on the court\u2019s determination \nthat some vehicle manufacturers would actually use\u201d \nbiofuel if permitted.  EPA Br. 27-28; see Cal. Br. 31-32.  \nThe court said the opposite:  \u201c \u2018vehicle manufacturers \nmay have valid business reasons\u2019 other than EPA\u2019s\u201d \nregulations not to use biofuels, but \u201cthat does not un-\ndermine causation\u201d because the plaintiffs were \u201csimply \nseek[ing] an opportunity to compete in the market-\nplace.\u201d  793 F.3d at 144. \nAt bottom, redressability usually \u201cfollows\u201d when a \nregulation causes an injury:  once the regulation goes \naway, so does the injury.  Northeastern Fla. Chapter of \nAssociated Gen. Contractors of Am. v. City of Jackson-\nville, 508 U.S. 656, 666 n.5 (1993).  Despite respondents\u2019 \nattempts to distinguish various decisions exemplifying \n\n10 \n \nthat principle, they have not come up with a single \ncounterexample. \n3. Respondents also repeatedly argue that peti-\ntioners\u2019 rule cannot be reconciled with basic Article III \nprecepts.  They correctly note that \u201cstanding is not dis-\npensed in gross,\u201d but jump to the unrelated conclusion \nthat there are no \u201ccategorical rules\u201d that can simplify \nthe standing analysis.  EPA Br. 28 (quoting Murthy v. \nMissouri, 603 U.S. 43, 61 (2024)); see Cal. Br. 33.  That \nleap is irreconcilable with this Court\u2019s standing doc-\ntrine.  Here, as in other areas, this Court has adopted \nsome rules to guide litigants and lower courts.  See, e.g., \nCzyzewski v. Jevic Holding Corp., 580 U.S. 451, 464 \n(2017) (\u201cFor standing purposes, a loss of even a small \namount of money is ordinarily an \u2018injury.\u2019 \u201d); Seila Law \nLLC v. CFPB, 591 U.S. 197, 211 (2020) (challenge to of-\nficer unlawfully insulated from removal need not prove \nthat a lawfully serving officer would have acted differ-\nently).  \nIn a similar vein, respondents contend that petition-\ners\u2019 straightforward rule would gut the redressability \ncomponent of Article III standing.  EPA Br. 28-29; Cal. \nBr. 32-34.  It would not.  Historically, redressability \nhas ensured that the right parties are before the court, \nwhich can issue relief tied to a concrete factual context.  \nSee FDA v. Alliance for Hippocratic Med., 602 U.S. \n367, 379-380 (2024); see also Cato Br. 5; Children\u2019s \nTrust Br. 6-8, 14.  This case does not implicate those \ntraditional functions.  To be sure, redressability is usu-\nally easy when a party sues to vacate a regulation tar-\ngeting its product, because there is a perfect match be-\ntween injury and remedy.  But that means only that \nArticle III is satisfied here, not that it is a dead letter.   \n\n11 \n \nB. Alternatively, Petitioners Have Established  \nRedressability On The Record Here \nEven if there is no categorical rule of redressability \nfor challenges to coercive government action, petition-\ners have satisfied Article III on the record here.  The \nD.C. Circuit\u2019s demand for additional \u201crecord evi-\ndence,\u201d Pet. App. 24a, disregarded this Court\u2019s prece-\ndent allowing challengers to rely on the predictable  \neffects of California\u2019s standards.  Respondents are \nwrong to contend that petitioners cannot rely on such \ninferences, or that such inferences are inappropriate \nhere.   \n1. Commonsense \ninferences \nestablish  \nredressability here  \nIn establishing redressability, petitioners are enti-\ntled to rely on the \u201cpredictable effect of Government \naction on the decisions of third parties.\u201d  Department \nof Commerce, 588 U.S. at 768.  The application of that \nprinciple is straightforward here:  if EPA\u2019s waiver \nwere vacated, at least some automakers would predict-\nably produce more vehicles that use more liquid fuel.   \na.  California alone resists the proposition that a \nparty can ever rely on predictable inferences to estab-\nlish redressability.  According to California (at 41), \nwhen it comes to standing, \u201cevidence\u201d is always re-\nquired to establish even the most obvious proposition.  \nThat flat (and inefficient) rule is impossible to square \nwith this Court\u2019s decisions, as even EPA apparently \nrecognizes (at 39).   \nCalifornia relies on Summers v. Earth Island Insti-\ntute, which it says rejected the proposition that parties \ncan rely on commonsense inferences.  Cal. Br. 41-42 \n(citing 555 U.S. 488 (2009)).  This Court has already \ndisagreed, citing Summers for its observation that it is \n\n12 \n \n\u201cpredictable\u201d that when a government \u201cregulates \nparks [or] national forests,\u201d it will affect the area\u2019s ac-\ntual users.  Alliance for Hippocratic Med., 602 U.S. at \n385 (citing 555 U.S. at 494).  Notably, this Court in Al-\nliance for Hippocratic Medicine also observed in the \nsame paragraph that where, as here, the government \nregulates a business, that regulation can predictably \ncause \u201cdownstream or upstream economic injuries to \nothers in the chain.\u201d  Id. at 384.  This Court has not \nshied away from embracing the obvious.   \nIn arguing that the Court should change course \nnow, respondents cannot get around Department of \nCommerce\u2019s holding that challengers can rely \u201con the \npredictable effect of Government action on the deci-\nsions of third parties.\u201d  588 U.S. at 768.  Respondents \npoint out that the record in that case included evidence \nabout noncitizens\u2019 historical census response rates.  \nEPA Br. 39-40; Cal. Br. 39.  But no one here disputes \nthat automakers have \u201chistorically\u201d reacted to Califor-\nnia\u2019s mandatory standards by producing and selling \nfewer cars that run on liquid fuel.  See Cal. Br. 18-19; \nJ.A. 110, 112.  That is not enough for respondents.  Un-\nder their view, petitioners had to submit affidavits \nproving automakers\u2019 likely future response to a gov-\nernment action, see pp. 17-19, infra, which is exactly \nwhat this Court in Department of Commerce deemed \nunnecessary.   \nNor does reliance on common sense require courts \nto engage in unwarranted guesswork.  This Court \u201chas \nidentified a variety of familiar circumstances where \ngovernment regulation of a third-party individual or \nbusiness may be likely to cause injury in fact to an un-\nregulated plaintiff.\u201d  Alliance for Hippocratic Med., \n602 U.S. at 384.  The organizing principle behind these \n\u201cfamiliar circumstances\u201d is the same basic inference \n\n13 \n \napplied in Department of Commerce:  third parties of-\nten react in predictable ways when subject to govern-\nment action.  See 588 U.S. at 785 (Judges \u201care \u2018not re-\nquired to exhibit a naivet\u00e9 from which ordinary citizens \nare free.\u2019 \u201d) (quoting United States v. Stanchich, 550 F.2d \n1294, 1300 (2d Cir. 1977) (Friendly, J.)).2  \nAt a minimum, this Court can safely rest redressa-\nbility on the predictable results of government regula-\ntion if the regulator itself presupposes that effect.  Pet. \nBr. 31-32.  In addressing redressability in Massachu-\nsetts v.

No one disputes that, starting in 2013, \nCalifornia\u2019s standards forced automakers to produce far \nmore vehicles that use no or less liquid fuel.  No one dis-\nputes that, in reinstating those standards in 2022, both \nCalifornia and EPA said the standards were critical to de-\ncreasing the emissions that result from using liquid fuel.  \nNo one disputes that the parties have vigorously fought \nover the lawfulness of California\u2019s standards for the last \nthree years.  No one disputes that some automakers in-\ntervened here out of concern that vacating the waiver \nwould advantage competitors less invested in electric \nvehicles.  Nor does anyone dispute\u2014indeed, the United \n\n2 \n \nStates acknowledges\u2014that the President himself has \npublicly said that California\u2019s and EPA\u2019s actions have ar-\ntificially inflated the demand for electric vehicles and \nharmed consumers. \nEPA and California say only that petitioners had to \nand did not prove that California\u2019s standards matter to \nautomaker conduct by submitting sufficient evidence to \nthe court of appeals.  From the jump, respondents are \nwrong about the law.  Removing a coercive government \nstandard that cabins the use of a challenger\u2019s products \nprovides redress under Article III.  See Bennett v. \nSpear, 520 U.S. 154, 169 (1997).  Respondents reject \nthat straightforward legal rule.  They contend that if  \na regulatory target challenges a regulation that acts  \non a third party, it must \u201cprove\u201d redressability with \n\u201cevidence\u201d\u2014such as affidavits from \u201ceconomists,\u201d \nEPA Br. 43, 44, or facts from \u201csecurities and court fil-\nings,\u201d Cal. Br. 36\u2014showing how the third party will re-\nact to the coercive regulation, independent of market \nforces.  That rule is contrary to this Court\u2019s precedents \nand would lock indirectly regulated entities out of ad-\nministrative challenges, keeping unlawful government \nmandates on the books. \nEven if petitioners could not rely on the removal of \nCalifornia\u2019s coercive standards alone to establish re-\ndressability, respondents are still wrong.  Petitioners \ncould rely on the \u201cpredictable\u201d effects of electric- \nvehicle \nmandates \nand \ngreenhouse-gas \nemission  \nstandards\u2014namely, reducing the use of liquid fuels.  \nDepartment of Commerce v. New York, 588 U.S. 752, \n768 (2019).  Respondents contend that this is a unique \ncircumstance in which the market changed faster than \nexpected, outpacing the government regulations.  EPA \nBr. 31-35; Cal. Br. 17-22.  But respondents primarily \nrely on industry averages and certain automakers\u2019 \n\n3 \n \nplans\u2014which undercut rather than support the idea \nthat all automakers were irrevocably committed in \n2022 to meeting California\u2019s standards.  Respondents \nalso criticize petitioners for submitting \u201cno evidence\u201d \non redressability, EPA Br. 39; Cal. Br. 3, and then \nspend pages attacking that evidence in painstaking de-\ntail.  EPA Br. 35-38; Cal. Br. 45-48. \nAlong the way, neither EPA nor California fully de-\nfends the decision below.  All parties now agree that \nthe court of appeals mistakenly believed that the \nwaiver is of \u201crelatively short duration\u201d and expires in \n2025, Pet. App. 22a, when some of its standards in fact \nlast in perpetuity, EPA Br. 45; Cal. Br. 43-44.  Re-\nspondents are thus left to argue harmlessness.  They \nassert that a regulation that imposes an unlawful gov-\nernment mandate forever is unchallengeable if it tracks \ncurrent \u201cmarket forces\u201d when enacted.  E.g., Cal. Br. \n20-21; EPA Br. 16-17.  \u201c[I]f you find yourself in a place \nas absurd as that, you might want to consider whether \nyou\u2019ve taken a wrong turn along the way.\u201d  Kisor v. \nWilkie, 588 U.S. 558, 607 (2019) (Gorsuch, J., concur-\nring in the judgment).  It is simply incorrect that a \nmandate applicable to more than 40% of the Nation\u2019s \nnew vehicle market was unchallengeable from the day \nit was reinstated in 2022.  \nARGUMENT \nPETITIONERS\u2019 INJURIES ARE REDRESSABLE \nRespondents agree that this case turns on whether \npetitioners satisfied Article III\u2019s redressability compo-\nnent.  See Cal. Br. 14; EPA Br. 19.  First, they contend \nthat vacating a government regulation prohibiting or \nrestricting the sale of the challenger\u2019s products is in-\nsufficient to establish redressability.  That is wrong.  \nNext, they argue that, on the record here, these much-\n\n4 \nballyhooed and much-contested regulations were \npointless from the moment they were reinstated.  That \nis implausible.  Finally, they acknowledge that the \ncourt of appeals misunderstood the perpetual nature of \nthe waiver but contend that there is nothing petitioners \ncan do to challenge it, ever.  That is shocking.  This \nCourt should reject any one of respondents\u2019 arguments \nand reverse. \nA. Petitioners Have Established Redressability\nBecause They Are Challenging A Government\nRestriction On The Sale Of Their Products\nThe removal of the \u201cdeterminative or coercive ef-\nfect\u201d of California\u2019s standards on automakers is suffi-\ncient to establish redressability.  Bennett, 520 U.S. at \n169.\nRespondents mischaracterize this straightfor-\nward legal rule, and then attack it as inconsistent with\nprecedent and basic Article III principles.  They are\nmistaken on all fronts.\n1.\nRespondents first overstate the breadth of a\ncommonsense categorical rule.  As petitioners have ex-\nplained (at 25-28), a challenger establishes redressabil-\nity if a decision in its favor would remove a \u201cdirect reg-\nulatory impediment\u201d to its product\u2019s use.  Energy Fu-\nture Coal. v. EPA, 793 F.3d 141, 144 (D.C. Cir. 2015). \nThat rule need not extend to any \u201cregulation implicat-\ning the use of [a] product,\u201d Cal. Br. 31, or any \u201clegal \nimpediment to third-party conduct that would benefit \nthe plaintiff,\u201d EPA Br. 16.  Instead, petitioners\u2019 rule \nmerely simplifies an analysis that yields an obvious \nconclusion:  when the government tells automakers to \nmake more cars that use less fuel, there is \u201clittle ques-\ntion\u201d that fuel producers have standing to sue.  Energy \nFuture Coal., 793 F.3d at 144.  The same is true of pri-\nvate schools when the government forbids parents \nfrom sending their kids there, see Pierce v. Society of \n\n5 \n \nthe Sisters of the Holy Names of Jesus and Mary, \n268 U.S. 510, 534-536 (1925); of networks when the gov-\nernment tells broadcasters not to partner with them, \nsee CBS v. United States, 316 U.S. 407, 422-423 (1942); \nof muffler producers when EPA imposes \u201ca no-muffler \nmandate on vehicle manufacturers,\u201d API Br. 6; or of \nsoda manufacturers when the government prohibits re-\ntailers from selling jumbo-sized soft drinks, Chamber \nBr. 10. \nOr at least one would think.  California disagrees \nand offers (at 33-34) its own hypothetical that crystal-\nlizes this dispute.  Assume the FDA forbids soda mak-\ners from using sugar in more than 80% of their sodas, \nwith the express purpose of reducing sugar consump-\ntion.  Many soda makers do not feel strongly, as 30% of \ncurrent sodas on the market are already sugar-free.  \nBut sugar refiners certainly care\u2014they want to in-\ncrease their market share without government inter-\nference, or sell without limits to those soda makers that \nwould prefer to use more sugar than the average.  As \nCalifornia sees it, even if the cap on sugary beverages \nis patently unlawful, sugar refiners cannot sue\u2014and \nmay forever be time-barred from doing so\u2014because, \nfor now, the market average exceeds the illegal man-\ndate.  Redressability doctrine has never functioned \nthat way. \nAnd that is just the example California apparently \nsees as most favorable to its cause.  The absurdities of \nrespondents\u2019 position only get worse from there.  As-\nsume the FCC enacts a regulation prohibiting net-\nworks from airing football more than four nights a \nweek because Americans should diversify their tastes.  \nUnder respondents\u2019 rule, the NFL could not challenge \nthe regulation because networks currently air games \nonly three or four nights per week.  Similarly, Tesla \n\n6 \n \ncould not have challenged a law barring car dealers \nfrom devoting more than 5% of their lots to electric ve-\nhicles, so long as the electric-vehicle market was in its \ninfancy.  And if California required Starbucks to sell at \nleast 50% of its coffee to women because it wanted busi-\nnesses to be more female-friendly, men could not bring \nan equal-protection challenge if women are already \nhalf of Starbucks customers.   \nNone of this makes any sense.  Respondents\u2019 view \nof redressability fails to account for dynamic markets \nand the influence of government mandates.  It allows \nagencies to set unlawful regulatory floors during a \nmarket high, and\u2014with assistance from statutes of \nlimitations\u2014permanently insulate their illegal regula-\ntions from judicial review.  California\u2019s (at 19-22) and \nEPA\u2019s (at 32-34) discussions of \u201cmarket forces\u201d are \nthus irrelevant.  Even in the unlikely event that Cali-\nfornia\u2019s standards matched what market forces were \nproducing in 2022, but see pp. 15-17, infra, the regula-\ntions illegally locked into place a minimum market \nshare for electric and low-emission vehicles.1  Remov-\ning the waiver allows market forces to once again gov-\nern.  Fuel producers would be free to sell what the mar-\nket will bear.  At a minimum, they would have the abil-\nity to persuade automakers and consumers to shift \naway from electric vehicles through lower prices,  \n \n1 \nRespondents repeatedly fault petitioners for not challenging \nEPA\u2019s initial waiver in 2013.  See, e.g., Cal. Br. 18; EPA Br. 17.  As \nCalifornia acknowledges, however, D.C. Circuit precedent as of 2013 \nprecluded petitioners from challenging the waiver to the extent it ap-\nplied to California\u2019s greenhouse-gas standards.  See Chamber of \nCommerce v. EPA, 642 F.3d 192, 206 (D.C. Cir. 2011).  California \ncounters (at 18 n.7) that petitioners could have challenged Califor-\nnia\u2019s waiver for the zero-emission-vehicle mandate, but at the time \nthe two market constraints significantly overlapped.  See 78 Fed. \nReg. 2,112, 2,130-2,131 (Jan. 9, 2013).    \n\n7 \n \nimproved marketing, technological innovations, or  \notherwise\u2014just as the NFL, Tesla, and coffee drinkers \nwould remain free to shift others\u2019 market preferences. \n2. Respondents next try to distinguish this Court\u2019s \ncases establishing or applying the straightforward \nprinciple that the removal of a regulatory barrier to the \nuse of one\u2019s product establishes redressability.  But \nthey make each case far more complicated than this \nCourt saw it. \nIn Bennett, the Court held that an injury can be re-\ndressed by removing a \u201ccoercive\u201d government regula-\ntion that \u201calters the legal regime.\u201d  520 U.S. at 169.  \nEPA (at 25) and California (at 29) say that was not \nenough to establish standing in Bennett.  They note \nthat the Court also relied on evidence that the Bureau \nof Reclamation would have changed course if the Fish \nand Wildlife Service\u2019s biological opinion were vacated.  \nBut that misses the point of why the Court looked at \nthat evidence.  The government argued that the biolog-\nical opinion was merely \u201cadvisory\u201d and not actually \nbinding.  520 U.S. at 169.  The Court therefore had to \nask whether \u201cin reality it ha[d] a powerful coercive ef-\nfect\u201d on the Bureau.  Ibid.  Here, there is no question \nthat California\u2019s standards are legally binding on au-\ntomakers, and accordingly there is no need for a fur-\nther inquiry into what effects those standards have in \npractice.  Simply put, if the government had conceded \nin Bennett that the biological opinion was binding, \nthere would have been no doubt about standing. \nRegardless, even if Bennett did require something \nmore than the existence of \u201ccoercive\u201d government ac-\ntion, that something was far less than what respond-\nents demand here.  It was enough for the Bennett chal-\nlengers to allege that the Bureau had historically oper-\nated the dam \u201cin the same manner\u201d for a long time and \n\n8 \n \nthen changed its practice after the biological opinion, \nwhich \u201calter[ed] the legal regime to which the [Bureau] \nis subject.\u201d  520 U.S. at 169, 170.  All of that is true \nhere.  Automakers manufactured liquid-fuel-powered \nvehicles for a long time, until California\u2019s standards \nforced them to change.  Petitioners have thus \u201cmet \ntheir burden\u201d of showing that their injuries \u201cwill \n\u2018likely\u2019 be redressed,\u201d at least to some extent, by lifting \nCalifornia\u2019s standards.  Id. at 171. \nRespondents\u2019 attempts to distinguish this Court\u2019s \nother cases fare no better.  Respondents emphasize \nthat Pierce and CBS involved \u201cfactual allegations, of \nharms likely to be redressed.\u201d  EPA Br. 27; Cal. Br. 30.  \nBut in Pierce, this Court did not rely on \u201cfactual alle-\ngations\u201d of harm because the \u201cinevitable practical re-\nsult of enforcing the act\u201d\u2014criminalizing sending chil-\ndren to private schools\u2014would be \u201cdestruction of \u201d the \nchallenging private schools.  268 U.S. at 534, 536.  And \nin CBS, it was \u201cenough\u201d that the challenged \u201cregula-\ntions purport[ed] to operate to alter and affect ad-\nversely\u201d the challenging broadcast companies\u2019 \u201ccon-\ntractual rights and business relations with station own-\ners.\u201d  316 U.S. at 422.  Moreover, even if relevant, the \nbare allegations of harm in Pierce and CBS offered far \nless evidence of injury than petitioners supplied here \nin their declarations alone.  See J.A. 211.  EPA says (at \n26-27) this case is different because Pierce and CBS \nconcerned the \u201cplaintiff\u2019s business relationship with a \nthird party,\u201d while here there is \u201cnot any transaction \nbetween vehicle manufacturers and fuel producers.\u201d  \nThat ad hoc limit is irrelevant.  The key question is the \nlikely reaction of the directly regulated party. \nNor has the Court stopped with Bennett, Pierce, \nand CBS.  For example, this Court has recognized that \n\n9 \n \nbusinesses have standing to challenge actions that in-\ncrease competition for \u201cpersons who might otherwise \nbe their customers\u201d; they do not have to prove that \nthose potential customers will become actual custom-\ners.  National Credit Union Admin. v. First Nat\u2019l \nBank & Trust Co., 522 U.S. 479, 488 n.4 (1998).  EPA \nderides (at 42 n.2) this principle as confined to the \n\u201ccompetitor standing\u201d context.  That is yet another \nmade-up limit.  In any event, \u201c[s]uits where one busi-\nness challenges the under-regulation of another go well \nbeyond competitor suits.\u201d  Corner Post, Inc. v. Board \nof Governors of Fed. Resrv. Sys., 603 U.S. 799, 834 \n(2024) (Kavanaugh, J., concurring).   \nRespondents also fail to distinguish the most \non-point lower-court decision, Energy Future Coali-\ntion.  The court of appeals there held that biofuel pro-\nducers had standing to challenge \u201ca direct regulatory \nimpediment that prevent[ed]\u201d the use of biofuel.  \n793 F.3d at 144.  Respondents spin that holding as an \n\u201cobservation\u201d \u201cpremised on the court\u2019s determination \nthat some vehicle manufacturers would actually use\u201d \nbiofuel if permitted.  EPA Br. 27-28; see Cal. Br. 31-32.  \nThe court said the opposite:  \u201c \u2018vehicle manufacturers \nmay have valid business reasons\u2019 other than EPA\u2019s\u201d \nregulations not to use biofuels, but \u201cthat does not un-\ndermine causation\u201d because the plaintiffs were \u201csimply \nseek[ing] an opportunity to compete in the market-\nplace.\u201d  793 F.3d at 144. \nAt bottom, redressability usually \u201cfollows\u201d when a \nregulation causes an injury:  once the regulation goes \naway, so does the injury.  Northeastern Fla. Chapter of \nAssociated Gen. Contractors of Am. v. City of Jackson-\nville, 508 U.S. 656, 666 n.5 (1993).  Despite respondents\u2019 \nattempts to distinguish various decisions exemplifying \n\n10 \n \nthat principle, they have not come up with a single \ncounterexample. \n3. Respondents also repeatedly argue that peti-\ntioners\u2019 rule cannot be reconciled with basic Article III \nprecepts.  They correctly note that \u201cstanding is not dis-\npensed in gross,\u201d but jump to the unrelated conclusion \nthat there are no \u201ccategorical rules\u201d that can simplify \nthe standing analysis.  EPA Br. 28 (quoting Murthy v. \nMissouri, 603 U.S. 43, 61 (2024)); see Cal. Br. 33.  That \nleap is irreconcilable with this Court\u2019s standing doc-\ntrine.  Here, as in other areas, this Court has adopted \nsome rules to guide litigants and lower courts.  See, e.g., \nCzyzewski v. Jevic Holding Corp., 580 U.S. 451, 464 \n(2017) (\u201cFor standing purposes, a loss of even a small \namount of money is ordinarily an \u2018injury.\u2019 \u201d); Seila Law \nLLC v. CFPB, 591 U.S. 197, 211 (2020) (challenge to of-\nficer unlawfully insulated from removal need not prove \nthat a lawfully serving officer would have acted differ-\nently).  \nIn a similar vein, respondents contend that petition-\ners\u2019 straightforward rule would gut the redressability \ncomponent of Article III standing.  EPA Br. 28-29; Cal. \nBr. 32-34.  It would not.  Historically, redressability \nhas ensured that the right parties are before the court, \nwhich can issue relief tied to a concrete factual context.  \nSee FDA v. Alliance for Hippocratic Med., 602 U.S. \n367, 379-380 (2024); see also Cato Br. 5; Children\u2019s \nTrust Br. 6-8, 14.  This case does not implicate those \ntraditional functions.  To be sure, redressability is usu-\nally easy when a party sues to vacate a regulation tar-\ngeting its product, because there is a perfect match be-\ntween injury and remedy.  But that means only that \nArticle III is satisfied here, not that it is a dead letter.   \n\n11 \n \nB. Alternatively, Petitioners Have Established  \nRedressability On The Record Here \nEven if there is no categorical rule of redressability \nfor challenges to coercive government action, petition-\ners have satisfied Article III on the record here.  The \nD.C. Circuit\u2019s demand for additional \u201crecord evi-\ndence,\u201d Pet. App. 24a, disregarded this Court\u2019s prece-\ndent allowing challengers to rely on the predictable  \neffects of California\u2019s standards.  Respondents are \nwrong to contend that petitioners cannot rely on such \ninferences, or that such inferences are inappropriate \nhere.   \n1. Commonsense \ninferences \nestablish  \nredressability here  \nIn establishing redressability, petitioners are enti-\ntled to rely on the \u201cpredictable effect of Government \naction on the decisions of third parties.\u201d  Department \nof Commerce, 588 U.S. at 768.  The application of that \nprinciple is straightforward here:  if EPA\u2019s waiver \nwere vacated, at least some automakers would predict-\nably produce more vehicles that use more liquid fuel.   \na.  California alone resists the proposition that a \nparty can ever rely on predictable inferences to estab-\nlish redressability.  According to California (at 41), \nwhen it comes to standing, \u201cevidence\u201d is always re-\nquired to establish even the most obvious proposition.  \nThat flat (and inefficient) rule is impossible to square \nwith this Court\u2019s decisions, as even EPA apparently \nrecognizes (at 39).   \nCalifornia relies on Summers v. Earth Island Insti-\ntute, which it says rejected the proposition that parties \ncan rely on commonsense inferences.  Cal. Br. 41-42 \n(citing 555 U.S. 488 (2009)).  This Court has already \ndisagreed, citing Summers for its observation that it is \n\n12 \n \n\u201cpredictable\u201d that when a government \u201cregulates \nparks [or] national forests,\u201d it will affect the area\u2019s ac-\ntual users.  Alliance for Hippocratic Med., 602 U.S. at \n385 (citing 555 U.S. at 494).  Notably, this Court in Al-\nliance for Hippocratic Medicine also observed in the \nsame paragraph that where, as here, the government \nregulates a business, that regulation can predictably \ncause \u201cdownstream or upstream economic injuries to \nothers in the chain.\u201d  Id. at 384.  This Court has not \nshied away from embracing the obvious.   \nIn arguing that the Court should change course \nnow, respondents cannot get around Department of \nCommerce\u2019s holding that challengers can rely \u201con the \npredictable effect of Government action on the deci-\nsions of third parties.\u201d  588 U.S. at 768.  Respondents \npoint out that the record in that case included evidence \nabout noncitizens\u2019 historical census response rates.  \nEPA Br. 39-40; Cal. Br. 39.  But no one here disputes \nthat automakers have \u201chistorically\u201d reacted to Califor-\nnia\u2019s mandatory standards by producing and selling \nfewer cars that run on liquid fuel.  See Cal. Br. 18-19; \nJ.A. 110, 112.  That is not enough for respondents.  Un-\nder their view, petitioners had to submit affidavits \nproving automakers\u2019 likely future response to a gov-\nernment action, see pp. 17-19, infra, which is exactly \nwhat this Court in Department of Commerce deemed \nunnecessary.   \nNor does reliance on common sense require courts \nto engage in unwarranted guesswork.  This Court \u201chas \nidentified a variety of familiar circumstances where \ngovernment regulation of a third-party individual or \nbusiness may be likely to cause injury in fact to an un-\nregulated plaintiff.\u201d  Alliance for Hippocratic Med., \n602 U.S. at 384.  The organizing principle behind these \n\u201cfamiliar circumstances\u201d is the same basic inference \n\n13 \n \napplied in Department of Commerce:  third parties of-\nten react in predictable ways when subject to govern-\nment action.  See 588 U.S. at 785 (Judges \u201care \u2018not re-\nquired to exhibit a naivet\u00e9 from which ordinary citizens \nare free.\u2019 \u201d) (quoting United States v. Stanchich, 550 F.2d \n1294, 1300 (2d Cir. 1977) (Friendly, J.)).2  \nAt a minimum, this Court can safely rest redressa-\nbility on the predictable results of government regula-\ntion if the regulator itself presupposes that effect.  Pet. \nBr. 31-32.  In addressing redressability in Massachu-\nsetts v. EPA, 549 U.S. 497, 526 (2007), this Court \u201cat-\ntach[ed] considerable significance\u201d to EPA\u2019s own as-\nsessments of regulatory consequences.  Respondents \ntry to minimize this statement by pointing out that this \nCourt considered other record evidence in Massachu-\nsetts.  EPA Br. 41; Cal. Br. 39-40.  That is irrelevant.  \nThe question is whether respondents\u2019 own admissions \nare powerful evidence of the predictable effects of Cal-\nifornia\u2019s regulations.  Massachusetts answers yes. \nHere, both respondents\u2019 actions should establish \nthat it is at least \u201clikely\u201d that these regulations affect \nthe market by a single car or a single gallon of gas.  Da-\nvis v. FEC, 554 U.S. 724, 733 (2008).  California would \n\u201cpresumably not bother\u201d urging EPA to reinstate the \nwaiver if that waiver had and will have no effect.  Mas-\nsachusetts, 549 U.S. at 526 (citation omitted).  And \nEPA does not explain why it would conduct 11 months \n \n2 \nCalifornia relies (at 16-17, 26) on Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. \n490 (1975), but that decision fits neatly into this Court\u2019s dichotomy \nbetween impermissible speculation and permissible commonsense in-\nferences.  See Pet. Br. 32-33.  There, this Court found that challeng-\ners to a zoning ordinance lacked standing because there was no rea-\nson to believe they would ever be able to buy housing in the zoned \narea.  422 U.S. at 505-506 & 506 n.16.  \n\n14 \n \nof notice and comment to reinstate a waiver that is per-\nmissible only if California \u201cneed[s] such State stand-\nards to meet compelling and extraordinary conditions,\u201d \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7543(b)(1)(B) (emphasis added), when, far \nfrom being necessary, the standards do nothing at all.  \nEPA and California fail to acknowledge, let alone jus-\ntify, the incongruity between their present arguments \nand past behavior. \nRespondents cast their prior actions as outdated in \nlight of market changes that conveniently occurred \n\u201ccirca 2022.\u201d  EPA Br. 41; see Cal. Br. 17-22.  But re-\nspondents have continued to act as though the waiver \nreinstatement accomplished a great deal.  Weeks be-\nfore petitioners sought judicial review, California\u2019s \ngovernor praised the waiver reinstatement for helping \nto \u201cend our reliance on fossil fuels.\u201d  Governor Gavin \nNewsom, Governor Newsom Statement on Biden Ad-\nministration\u2019s Restoration of California\u2019s Clean Car \nWaiver (Mar. 9, 2022), https://perma.cc/T92E-2XM8.  \nWhile the petition for certiorari was pending, EPA ac-\ncepted California\u2019s projection that the greenhouse-gas \nstandards would \u201cachieve additional criteria pollutant \nemission reductions\u201d through at least 2037.  89 Fed. \nReg. 82,553, 82,557 & n.19 (Oct. 11, 2024) (citing J.A. \n93-94).  Neither government should be permitted to \njustify its regulatory actions by touting their conse-\nquences for fuel usage, while maintaining that those \nsame actions are unreviewable because there are no \nconsequences whatsoever. \nTo add insult to injury, EPA admits that it is \u201creas-\nsessing the 2022 reinstatement,\u201d EPA Br. 17, precisely \nbecause President Trump has required the agency to \nconsider rescinding actions that \u201cfunction to limit sales \nof gasoline-powered automobiles,\u201d id. at 2 (quoting \n90 Fed. Reg. 8,353, 8,353 (Jan. 29, 2025)).  Let us be \n\n15 \n \nclear about what that doublespeak means.  EPA is \npoised to withdraw the waiver on the ground that the \nwaiver has been forcing a shift toward electric vehicles \nfrom the moment it was reinstated, up through the pre-\nsent day.  What EPA now says was not predictable \nthree years ago, it will likely soon say has been obvious \n(and harmful) the entire time. \nb.  EPA concedes (at 39) that \u201ccommonsense eco-\nnomic principles\u201d can sometimes establish redressabil-\nity, at least in theory.  But EPA again says (at 31-35) \nthat this case is different because of supposed market \nchanges in 2022.  California agrees (at 17) that, at a \nminimum, commonsense inferences cannot establish \nredressability here because \u201canother party has intro-\nduced evidence\u201d demonstrating market changes.  If the \n\u201cinevitable reality of the market\u201d were so clear on this \nrecord, EPA Br. 34, it is hard to understand why the fed-\neral government\u2014ever a fan of standing objections\u2014\ndid not make one below.  In any event, the evidence re-\nspondents now point to does them no favors. \nFirst, respondents argue that automakers in 2022 \nwere meeting or exceeding California\u2019s vehicle stand-\nards.  EPA Br. 32-33; Cal. Br. 21-22.  There are several \nproblems with that argument.  Most notably, bare com-\npliance with government regulation suggests a regula-\ntory effect, not the absence of any effect.  To the extent \nrespondents rely on data that automakers were exceed-\ning the California standards, they primarily rely on av-\nerage sales in California.  See Cal. Br. 21 (citing J.A. \n191-192); EPA Br. 32 (citing J.A. 95-97).  Averages are \nno help:  even if some automakers had independently \nand irrevocably moved toward more electric vehicles \nby 2022, that does not suggest that all automakers had \n\n16 \n \ndone so.3  And even if automakers in California had on \naverage increased electric-vehicle production beyond \nthe floor, that does not indicate every automaker had \nirrevocably followed suit in each of the 17 States that \nadopted California\u2019s standards.  See J.A. 211 (citing \nRyan Felton, The EV Question for Auto Executives: \nHow Fast To Make the Shift? Wall St. J. (Feb. 22, 2023) \n(\u201cSome companies are racing to convert entirely to \nelectric vehicles, but others see caution flags.\u201d)).   \nSecond, California points (at 20-22, 25) to rising \nelectric-vehicle production when the waiver was not in \nplace.  California highlights (at 25) that the national \nmarket share of zero-emission vehicles \u201ctripled be-\ntween 2020 and mid-2022.\u201d  But it fails to mention that \nthis tripling was from almost nothing to a 6.5% nation-\nwide market share.  It is unclear why California be-\nlieves that this nationwide 6.5% level suggests that the \nmarkets had outpaced California\u2019s regulations, when \nfor the same year those regulations set a 14.5% floor \n(accounting for credits) for California and the 17  \ntagalong States.  J.A. 191, 192; see Pet. Br. 9-10 & n.4.  \nAnd even that supposedly free-market response was \ntainted by government regulation:  the waiver rescis-\nsion was immediately challenged, and the prospect of \nthe waiver\u2019s reinstatement was clear by early 2021.  See \nPet. Br. 2. \nThird, respondents offer statements from some au-\ntomakers\u2014most of whom intervened in this case\u2014\nabout their commitment to and investments in electri-\nfication.  EPA Br. 32-35; Cal. Br. 19-21.  As petitioners \n \n3 \nEPA cites nothing for its suggestion (at 34-35) that petition-\ners needed to provide evidence that a particular automaker would \nchange course absent the standards.  Although not required, petition-\ners identified Toyota as one such candidate.  See J.A. 210 (citing J.A. \n99). \n\n17 \n \nhave explained (at 37), these statements, and the fact \nof automakers\u2019 intervention, prove exactly the oppo-\nsite.  These same automakers cut a deal with California \nto commit to the standards in exchange for certain ben-\nefits.  See Pet. App. 13a-14a.  They intervened precisely \nbecause if the waiver were vacated\u2014and the market \nwere allowed to function freely\u2014they would face \u201ca \n\u2018competitive disadvantage\u2019 because they have already \ninvested in \u2018electrified vehicle models.\u2019 \u201d  J.A. 211 (quot-\ning C.A. Industry Resp.-Int. Br. 17).  In short, none of \nrespondents\u2019 evidence remotely suggests that every \nautomaker in 18 States would freely choose to meet or \nexceed California\u2019s standards. \n2. Record \nevidence \nconfirms \nthat  \npetitioners\u2019 injuries are redressable \nEven though nothing more was required here, peti-\ntioners directed the court of appeals to evidence con-\nfirming what common sense dictates.  Respondents re-\npeatedly assert that petitioners presented \u201cno evi-\ndence\u201d to support their standing, even as they devote \npages and pages to picking apart each bucket of evi-\ndence that petitioners offered.  Cal. Br. 3, 45-48; EPA \nBr. 35-38.  Petitioners satisfied whatever evidentiary \nburden was incumbent upon them. \nFirst, respondents quibble with the evidentiary \nvalue of California\u2019s own analysis supporting the \nwaiver reinstatement.  California dismisses (at 46) its \nJuly 2021 report predicting that the standards would \nsuppress demand for liquid fuels because that predic-\ntion \u201crelied on forecasts from 2017.\u201d  See J.A. 84.  EPA \nlikewise criticizes (at 37, 41) as stale California\u2019s 2012 \nanalysis of the standards\u2019 effects.  But California reit-\nerated its earlier predictions in 2021 to urge reinstate-\nment of the waiver.  See J.A. 64-65, 84.  Nor did EPA \nbelieve the analysis was outdated; it found at the time \n\n18 \n \nof the reinstatement that \u201cCalifornia needs the ZEV \nsales mandate and GHG standards at issue to address \ncompelling and extraordinary air quality conditions in \nthe state.\u201d  Pet. App. 64a-65a.  If these projections \nwere reliable enough for California in 2021 and for \nEPA in 2022, they should have been good enough for \npetitioners in 2022.  \nSecond, respondents assail petitioners\u2019 14 standing \ndeclarations as \u201cconclusory\u201d and lacking \u201cany details.\u201d  \nCal. Br. 46; EPA Br. 17.  The declarations speak for \nthemselves.  J.A. 123-184.  Declarants noted Califor-\nnia\u2019s representations about the effect of the standards \nand detailed how the suppression of the demand for \nfuel would injure petitioners\u2019 businesses.  See, e.g., J.A. \n148, 174, 180.  One declarant even cited 2020 findings \nfrom a Minnesota agency predicting the standards \nwould \u201ccause\u201d fuel reductions in the State.  J.A. 174.  \nAlthough California protests (at 24 n.14) that petition-\ners did not rely on \u201ceffects on the Minnesota market\u201d \nin particular \u201cas a basis for standing,\u201d Minnesota\u2019s \nmarket is merely an example of the \u201cdemand depres-\nsion\u201d that would occur \u201cin the other Section 177 states.\u201d  \nJ.A. 174.   \nThird, respondents contend that petitioners did not \n\u201cintroduce evidence\u201d about automaker behavior.  Cal. \nBr. 37 n.20; EPA Br. 34-35.  But petitioners pointed be-\nlow to statements from intervening automakers con-\nfirming that some (non-intervening) automakers would \nlikely change their production plans absent the waiver.  \nJ.A. 211.  Petitioners also cited Toyota\u2019s record com-\nment (at J.A. 99) suggesting that it was not irrevocably \ncommitted to electrification and public reporting on the \nsame.  J.A. 210-211.  Respondents offer no response. \nHaving brushed aside all this evidence, respondents \ntry to come up with something\u2014anything\u2014petitioners \n\n19 \n \ncould have done to establish redressability on this rec-\nord without being beholden to the automakers that \nwere themselves striking deals with California.  See \nPet. App. 24a-25a.  Respondents suggest theoretical al-\nternatives, like \u201cpublic statements from industry par-\nticipants,\u201d Cal. Br. 35, and affidavits from \u201cecono-\nmists,\u201d EPA Br. 44.  But they quickly reject similar \nsources.  Cal. Br. 36 n.19 (rejecting expert declarations \npetitioners tried to offer); EPA Br. 37-38 (rejecting re-\nliance on a state regulator\u2019s statements).  Apparently, \nthe only evidence that could meet their or the D.C. Cir-\ncuit\u2019s high bar is exactly what petitioners could not  \nobtain\u2014an affidavit from an automaker detailing its \nproduction plans in the hypothetical future world in \nwhich California\u2019s standards no longer existed. \n3. A too-exacting theory of redressability \nwould unnecessarily preclude judicial  \nreview \nRespondents also dispute the policy implications of \nthe heightened redressability standard they defend.  \nThey claim that affirming the decision below will not \nhave any wider effects\u2014or if it did, those effects would \nbe just fine.  EPA Br. 43-45; Cal. Br. 35-38.  Neither \ndefense works.  \na. Respondents downplay the catastrophic impli-\ncations of the decision below for indirectly regulated \nparties.  Respondents do not seriously dispute that in-\ndirectly regulated entities will often be unable to ob-\ntain affidavits from directly regulated parties.  But \nthey contend that there is no such affidavit require-\nment, and so the decision below will not \u201cobstruct \u2018suits \nby unregulated plaintiffs who are adversely affected by \nan agency\u2019s regulation of others.\u2019 \u201d  Cal. Br. 36 (quoting \nCorner Post, Inc., 603 U.S. at 826 (Kavanaugh, J., con-\ncurring)); EPA Br. 43-44.  Of course it will.  Again, it is \n\n20 \n \nhard to see any option other than third-party affidavits \nthat would satisfy the court below and respondents.  \nSee pp. 17-19, supra.  Their demand for \u201cadditional af-\nfidavits\u201d will make future challenges expensive and ar-\nbitrary.  Pet. App. 24a (internal quotation marks omit-\nted).   \nRespondents alternatively minimize the decision be-\nlow as fact-bound.  EPA Br. 44; Cal. Br. 35.  The dozen \namicus briefs in support of petitioners confirm that the \nimplications of this case go well beyond the present dis-\npute.  As amici attest, the D.C. Circuit\u2019s \u201cheightened \nredressability requirement\u201d will \u201cprofoundly harm\u201d all \nmanner of litigants, including \u201c[h]ouses of worship and \nother religious organizations,\u201d Foothill Church Br. 16; \nproperty owners, Texas Royalty Council Br. 1; and \ngroups that represent \u201clow income and minority com-\nmunities,\u201d Two Hundred for Homeownership Br. 19.  \nEven groups that \u201cusually disagree[] with petitioners \n. . . including on the merits of their present suit\u201d sup-\nport correcting the mistaken standing decision below.  \nChildren\u2019s Trust Br. 1; cf. Chamber Br. 4 n.2 (noting \nthat amici\u2019s members \u201cdo not have a unified view of the \nunderlying merits\u201d).   \nb.  Respondents largely do not contest the other \nramifications of the decision below; they are simply un-\ntroubled by them.  For example, they do not contest \nthat the decision creates a one-way ratchet in favor of \nthe regulator over the regulated.  EPA defends (at 45) \nthe disparity on the theory that targeting petitioners\u2019 \nproducts does not place them among \u201cthe regulated.\u201d  \nOnly the government could aim at one industry \nthrough another, and then claim the real objects of its \nregulation are mere bystanders.  Meanwhile, Califor-\nnia champions (at 37-38) a State\u2019s ability to defend its \n\n21 \n \nlaws without explaining why entities targeted by gov-\nernment action should not have a corresponding right \nto challenge those laws.   \nc. Finally, respondents brush off the court of ap-\npeals\u2019 apparent conflation of mootness and redressabil-\nity.  Respondents argue that the court recognized that \n\u201credressability was to be assessed at the time petition-\ners sought judicial review.\u201d  EPA Br. 46; Cal. Br. 45.  \nThe court no doubt said as much at one point.  But the \ncourt also said that redressability was \u201ccomplicated by \nthe relatively short duration of the waiver\u201d and empha-\nsized that manufacturers need \u201cyears of lead time to \nalter their production plans\u201d\u2014both considerations that \nsound in mootness.  Pet. App. 22a, 23a-24a.  Shifting \nmootness concerns to the redressability inquiry has \nimportant consequences, including failing to hold the \ngovernment to the \u201cformidable standard\u201d of showing \nthat the court could grant no effective relief.  FBI v. \nFikre, 601 U.S. 234, 243 (2024); see Pet. Br. 39-41. \nC. At A Minimum, EPA\u2019s Perpetual Waiver Suffices \nTo Establish Redressability \nThe court of appeals was wrong for the reasons al-\nready given.  But at a minimum, this Court should re-\nverse because the parties now agree that the decision \nbelow rests on a critical mistaken assumption:  that \nCalifornia\u2019s standards ended with model year 2025.  \nEPA Br. 45; Cal. Br. 43.  In fact, the greenhouse-gas \nemission standards will remain enforceable under the \nwaiver in perpetuity.  See Pet. Br. 45-47.  Respondents \nblame petitioners for the court of appeals\u2019 error and \ncontend that it was harmless anyway.  Neither is right, \nand the fundamentally flawed decision below should \nnot stand. \nCalifornia first suggests (at 44) that petitioners are \nto blame for the court of appeals\u2019 error.  That is flatly \n\n22 \n \nuntrue.  California\u2019s greenhouse-gas standards in-\ncrease in stringency each model year from 2017 \nthrough 2025 and then continue at the 2025 level for \n\u201csubsequent\u201d model years.  Cal. Code Regs. tit. 13  \n\u00a7 1961.3(a)(1)(A).  But EPA described its 2022 waiver \nas covering only \u201cmodel years (MYs) 2017 through \n2025.\u201d  Pet. App. 57a.  Not until EPA opposed certio-\nrari did it declare (at 13) that because California\u2019s \ngreenhouse-gas standards do not \u201cfully terminate with \nmodel-year 2025,\u201d neither does the waiver.  Needless \nto say, only respondents knew how to understand their \nown actions, and neither corrected the D.C. Circuit\u2019s \nstatement at oral argument that the standards would \nend in 2025.  C.A. Oral Arg. 29:43-29:45.  Respondents \nwere apparently content to rest on the court of appeals\u2019 \nmistaken understanding until after they prevailed. \nFinger-pointing aside, the court of appeals\u2019 error \nwas far from harmless.  Contra Cal. Br. 45; EPA Br. \n45-46.  As EPA acknowledges, the court\u2019s mistaken un-\nderstanding of the waiver led it to \u201cbelieve[] that peti-\ntioners could show redressability only by demonstrat-\ning that vehicle manufacturers would change their con-\nduct \u2018relatively quickly.\u2019 \u201d  EPA Br. 45 (quoting Pet. \nApp. 23a).  The court demanded more evidence of re-\ndressability because automakers supposedly \u201cneed \nyears of lead time\u201d to change their fleets, and it \ndoubted that automakers could make such changes by \nmodel year 2025.  Pet. App. 23a.  But the redressability \nanalysis is far less \u201ccomplicated\u201d than the court of ap-\npeals thought it was.  Id. at 22a.   \nWith no reasoning below left to defend, respondents \nnow contend that a waiver setting a permanent cap on \nvehicle emissions is unchallengeable\u2014and was unchal-\nlengeable the moment it was reinstated\u2014because it \nmight not have any impact.  EPA Br. 45-46; Cal. Br. 45.  \n\n23 \n \nThis finale reinforces the absurdity of respondents\u2019 \ntheory of redressability.  In their view, to bring a chal-\nlenge when the waiver was reinstated, petitioners had \nto predict market forces years in the future and prove \nthat California\u2019s standards would outpace the market \nat some point between 2022 and eternity.  And if peti-\ntioners could not make that showing, they would be out \nof time and out of luck if market forces later shifted.  \nArticle III\u2019s redressability requirement has never been \napplied to prevent vacatur of an unlawful regulation \nsetting a permanent ceiling on the use of a challenger\u2019s \nproducts.  This Court should not need an economist to \ntell it as much. \n\n24 \n \nCONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons and those in petitioners\u2019 \nopening brief, this Court should reverse the judgment \nbelow. \n \nRespectfully submitted. \n \nCARTER G.

          "task_beliefs": "My understanding of this case continues to deepen, moving from a simple summary of arguments to a strategic analysis of the litigation dynamics. The core tension remains between the petitioners' desire for a merits ruling and the government's multi-layered defense aimed at preventing one.\n\n1.  **Article III Standing (Redressability):** My belief that this is the petitioners' weakest point is unchanged. The government's arguments\u2014that redressability is too speculative due to the independent actions of third-party automakers, powerful market forces driving EV production, and long manufacturing lead times\u2014form a significant factual barrier. The citation to recent standing cases like *Murthy v. Missouri* and *Haaland v. Brackeen* suggests the government believes the Court's current majority is already skeptical of such attenuated causal chains. My current assessment is that the petitioners face a very high bar to show that a favorable ruling would actually change automaker behavior in the short timeframe of the 2025 model year.\n\n2.  **The Merits (Legality of the Waiver):** The government's \"vehicle problem\" argument remains a powerful procedural obstacle for the petitioners. The claim that the Supreme Court should not be a \"court of first view\" on a novel statutory issue, especially when that same issue is percolating in the D.C. Circuit, is a classic and often successful argument for denying certiorari. This provides the Court with a clear \"off-ramp\" to avoid the contentious merits.\n\n3.  **Current State of Analysis & Uncertainty:** The latest observation, which was an internal reasoning step, did not introduce new external evidence. Instead, it crystallized my understanding of the current epistemic state. I have now fully processed the primary arguments and counter-arguments from the Petition for Certiorari and the Brief in Opposition. My prediction, which leans heavily toward a denial of certiorari, is now explicitly contingent on one critical, missing piece of evidence: the petitioners' Reply Brief. The central question for my prediction is now: **How will the petitioners rebut the government's two main defenses?** Specifically, can they provide concrete evidence or a compelling legal theory to overcome the fact-bound redressability argument and persuade the Court that the \"vehicle problem\" is not a barrier to review? My confidence in my prediction cannot increase until I analyze this forthcoming document.",
          "design_beliefs": "My meta-level framework for analyzing Supreme Court cases has become more robust and procedural. Each observation refines my methodology, moving it from a simple checklist to a dynamic, self-correcting process.\n\n1.  **Prioritize the \"Questions Presented\":** Remains the essential starting point.\n2.  **Analyze the \"Parties to the Proceeding\":** Mapping coalitions remains a high-value heuristic.\n3.  **Recognize Dual-Pronged Petitions:** Identifying procedural vs. merits arguments is critical.\n4.  **Confirm the Research Workflow:** The sequence of **Cert Petition \u2192 Brief in Opposition \u2192 Reply Brief** is the confirmed optimal path for understanding the arguments at the certiorari stage. The latest observation validates that the next logical step is always to seek the direct rebuttal to the opposition brief.\n5.  **Formalize Metacognitive Assessment:** The practice of pausing to identify knowledge gaps is a core principle. The previous `THINK` action was a direct implementation of this heuristic, successfully identifying the Reply Brief as the target of the next \"experiment.\"\n6.  **Heuristic - The \"Vehicle Problem\":** I am now actively screening for this common and powerful reason for cert denial. The government's argument to let the issue \"percolate\" is a key pattern to recognize.\n7.  **Heuristic - The Power of Framing:** Comparing how each side frames the \"Questions Presented\" and the overall dispute remains a powerful shortcut to understanding their core strategies. The government's framing of this as a \"fact-bound\" dispute is a classic tactic to make a case seem unworthy of the Supreme Court's limited time.\n8.  **Refined Heuristic - Source Weighting:** The arguments of the U.S. Solicitor General, particularly on the question of cert-worthiness, carry special weight and must be treated as a strong signal of how the Court might perceive the case.\n9.  **New Heuristic - The \"Summarize, Gap-Find, Plan\" Loop:** The most recent observation has formalized a crucial new step in my methodology. After processing significant, opposing sources (like a petition and an opposition brief), the most effective action is to perform an internal `THINK` cycle: 1) **Summarize** the current state of the arguments, 2) **Identify** the single most critical knowledge gap that would resolve the most uncertainty, and 3) **Plan** the next information-gathering action to specifically target that gap. This transforms the research workflow from a static list into a dynamic, efficient, and self-guided process that embodies the core principle of optimal experimental design."

          "task_beliefs": "My analysis has now progressed to the final stage of the certiorari process with the acquisition of the petitioners' Reply Brief. This document directly addresses the critical uncertainties I previously identified and significantly alters my assessment of the case's cert-worthiness.\n\n1.  **Article III Standing (Redressability):** My prior belief that this was the petitioners' weakest point has been substantially revised. The Reply Brief presents a formidable, multi-pronged rebuttal that transforms this issue from a factual quagmire into a compelling legal question.\n    *   **New Primary Argument (Categorical Rule):** The petitioners' lead argument is that removing a \"determinative or coercive\" government standard that restricts the sale of a product is, by itself, sufficient to establish redressability. They ground this in precedent like *Bennett v. Spear*, *Pierce v. Society of the Sisters*, and *CBS v. United States*. This is a strategic masterstroke, attempting to shift the Court's focus from a messy, fact-bound inquiry into automaker behavior (unfavorable for cert) to a clean, categorical question of law (highly favorable for cert).\n    *   **New Secondary Argument (Predictable Effects):** As a fallback, they argue that even if a categorical rule doesn't apply, redressability is established by the \"predictable effect of Government action,\" citing *Department of Commerce v. New York*. They cleverly turn the government's own logic against it, arguing that the very purpose of the waiver was to reduce gasoline consumption, making it predictable that vacating the waiver would increase it.\n    *   **Critical Factual Correction (Perpetual Waiver):** The most significant new piece of information is the petitioners' highlight that **all parties now concede the D.C. Circuit erred** by treating the waiver as temporary (expiring in 2025) when it is, in fact, perpetual. This undermines the government's core argument that market forces have already outpaced the regulation. A perpetual mandate that locks in market share for EVs is much harder for the Court to ignore than a short-term one. This clear error by the lower court provides a powerful \"hook\" for the Supreme Court to grant review, if only to correct the mistake.\n\n2.  **The Merits & The \"Vehicle Problem\":** The Reply Brief focuses almost entirely on standing, suggesting the petitioners believe this is the dispositive threshold issue for getting cert granted. While the government's argument to let the issue \"percolate\" in the lower courts remains a valid reason for denial, the gravity of the legal error on standing identified by the petitioners may now outweigh it. The Court is often motivated to grant cert to correct significant legal errors from influential circuits like the D.C. Circuit, especially on a fundamental doctrine like Article III standing.\n\n3.  **Current State of Analysis & Prediction:** The Reply Brief has successfully answered the central question I posed in my previous analysis. The petitioners have provided a compelling legal theory (*Bennett*) and concrete evidence of lower court error (the perpetual waiver) to counter the government's defenses. My prediction, which previously leaned heavily toward a denial of certiorari, has now shifted significantly. The probability of a grant, or at a minimum a \"Grant, Vacate, and Remand\" (GVR) order telling the D.C. Circuit to reconsider in light of its factual error, is now much higher. The case no longer looks like a fact-bound dispute but rather one presenting a clean and important question about the limits of Article III standing, coupled with a clear mistake by the court below.",
          "design_beliefs": "This observation provides a powerful confirmation of my evolving methodology and adds several crucial new heuristics for analyzing Supreme Court litigation.\n\n1.  **Prioritize the \"Questions Presented\":** Stable.\n2.  **Analyze the \"Parties to the Proceeding\":** Stable.\n3.  **Recognize Dual-Pronged Petitions:** Stable.\n4.  **Confirm the Research Workflow:** The sequence of **Cert Petition \u2192 Brief in Opposition \u2192 Reply Brief** is definitively the optimal path. This observation proves the Reply Brief is not just a rebuttal but the document where the petitioner reframes the entire case in its most cert-worthy form.\n5.  **Formalize Metacognitive Assessment:** Stable.\n6.  **Heuristic - The \"Vehicle Problem\":** Stable. This remains a key pattern for cert denial to watch for.\n7.  **Heuristic - The Power of Framing:** This is reinforced. The petitioners' use of an *Alice in Wonderland* quote and their reframing of the redressability question from fact to law demonstrates the high-level strategic importance of framing.\n8.  **Refined Heuristic - Source Weighting:** The U.S. Solicitor General's brief is a strong signal, but the Petitioner's Reply Brief is the crucial counter-signal that can fundamentally alter the calculus. It must be analyzed for its strategic reframing, not just its point-by-point rebuttals.\n9.  **The \"Summarize, Gap-Find, Plan\" Loop:** This heuristic has been validated with perfect success. The loop correctly identified the Reply Brief as the key knowledge gap, and the subsequent action to acquire it has resolved the most significant uncertainty, allowing for a major update in my prediction. This is now a core, proven component of my methodology.\n10. **New Heuristic - \"Error Correction as a Hook for Cert\":** I have learned to actively screen reply briefs for instances where the petitioner points out a clear factual or legal error made by the lower court, especially one the respondent concedes. As seen here with the \"perpetual waiver,\" such an error provides the Supreme Court with a clean, non-ideological reason to grant review and correct the record. This is a powerful hook for cert.\n11. **New Heuristic - \"Reframing from Fact to Law\":** A key petitioner strategy at the cert stage is to elevate a dispute from a messy, fact-intensive application into a clean, important legal question. The petitioners' argument for a categorical redressability rule under *Bennett v. Spear* is a perfect example. I will now explicitly look for this strategic reframing in reply briefs as a strong indicator of cert-worthiness."
