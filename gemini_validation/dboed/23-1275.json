    "facts_of_the_case": "Medicaid, established in 1965, is a cooperative federal-state program that provides medical assistance to needy individuals. The program offers federal funding to states that agree to comply with certain conditions, including the \u201cfree-choice-of-provider\u201d provision added in 1967, which ensures Medicaid beneficiaries can obtain medical assistance from any qualified provider. States must submit their medical assistance plans to the Secretary of Health and Human Services for approval, and the Secretary can withhold funds if states fail to comply with federal requirements.\n\nIn South Carolina, Planned Parenthood South Atlantic operates two health centers providing various medical services, including contraception, cancer screenings, and STI treatment. Julie Edwards, a Medicaid beneficiary, received care at Planned Parenthood and planned to continue her gynecological care there. However, in July 2018, South Carolina\u2019s Governor issued an executive order directing the Department of Health and Human Services to terminate abortion clinics from the Medicaid program. As a result, DHHS informed Planned Parenthood that it was no longer qualified to provide services to Medicaid beneficiaries and terminated its enrollment agreements immediately. Planned Parenthood and Edwards then sued the Director of DHHS in federal court, seeking to block enforcement of the executive order.\n\nThe district court initially granted a preliminary injunction blocking South Carolina from terminating Planned Parenthood\u2019s Medicaid enrollment, and after multiple appeals to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit and one previous remand from the Supreme Court, the Fourth Circuit again held that Medicaid beneficiaries can sue to enforce their right to choose their provider.",

The any-qualified-\nprovider provision, 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(23)(A), states \nin relevant part: \n(a) Contents \nA State plan for medical assistance must\u2014 \n* * * * * \n(23) provide that (A) any individual eligible \nfor medical assistance \u2026 may obtain such \nassistance from any [provider] qualified to \nperform the service or services required \u2026 \nwho undertakes to provide him such services \n\u2026. \n \n \n \n \n \n\n2 \n \nINTRODUCTION \nThe Medicaid Act is not a civil-rights statute. It \ncreates a cooperative-federalism program in which \n\u201cfederal and state actors work[ ] together \u2026 to carry \nout the statute\u2019s aims.\u201d Health & Hosp. Corp. of \nMarion Cnty. v. Talevski, 599 U.S. 166, 182 (2023). \nUnsurprisingly, the Act focuses on that relationship \nbetween the states and the federal government\u2014not \nthe creation of individual healthcare rights. Indeed, \nCongress wanted states to have substantial discretion \nto innovate with their Medicaid programs. So it made \nthe Act a substantial-compliance regime, giving the \nSecretary of the Department of Health & Human \nServices discretion whether to withhold funding when \na state\u2019s administration of its plan deviates from the \nAct\u2019s specifications. 42 U.S.C. 1396c(2). \nRespondents would have this Court transfer that \ndiscretion to the federal courts by implying a private \nright in the any-qualified-provider provision. But this \nCourt does not recognize private rights in federal \nstatutes \u201cas a matter of course.\u201d Talevski, 599 U.S. at \n183. And Spending Clause legislation, in particular, \nmust clear a \u201cdemanding bar\u201d: it \u201cmust unambig-\nuously confer individual federal rights.\u201d Id. at 180. \nAfter all, the typical remedy in this context \u201cis not a \nprivate cause of action for noncompliance but rather \naction by the Federal Government to terminate funds \nto the State.\u201d Id. at 183 (cleaned up). \nTo clear that high bar, it is not enough that Con-\ngress tried to benefit a specific class. Ibid. Instead, it \nis \u201ccritical\u201d that the statute\u2019s \u201ctext and structure\u201d use \n\u201cexplicit rights-creating terms.\u201d Gonzaga Univ. v. \nDoe, 536 U.S. 273, 284, 286\u201387 (2002). \n\n3 \n \nThe any-qualified-provider provision lacks any \n\u201cclear rights-creating language.\u201d Talevski, 599 U.S. at \n186 (cleaned up). Its text says merely that a plan must \nprovide that an \u201cindividual eligible for medical assis-\ntance\u201d \u201cmay obtain\u201d it from a \u201cqualified\u201d provider. 42 \nU.S.C. 1396a(a)(23)(A). There is no mention of \n\u201crights.\u201d And structurally, the provision is nestled in \na list labeled \u201cContents\u201d setting out 87 disparate \nitems that plans must include. 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a). \nThat text and structure is nothing like FNHRA\u2019s \nrights-creating provisions, which Talevski analyzed. \nTextually, those provisions involve (1) a nursing home \nresident\u2019s \u201cright to be free from\u201d restraints, 42 U.S.C. \n1396r(c)(1)(A)(ii) (emphasis added), and (2) conditions \nrelated to a resident\u2019s \u201c[t]ransfer and discharge \nrights,\u201d 42 U.S.C. 1396r(c)(2) (emphasis added). \nStructurally, both are listed in a bill of rights: \n\u201c[r]equirements relating to residents\u2019 rights.\u201d 42 \nU.S.C. 1396r(c) (emphasis added). And when FNHRA \ndiscusses the choice of a provider, it is unambiguous: \ndeclaring a resident\u2019s \u201cright\u201d \u201cto choose a personal \nattending physician.\u201d 42 U.S.C. 1396r(c)(1)(A)(i) \n(emphasis added). None of that is true here. \nReading a private right into the any-qualified-\nprovider provision would undermine the relationship \nbetween the states and the federal government. \nPrivate enforcement subjects states to unanticipated \n(and expensive) lawsuits. And it takes the Secretary\u2019s \nenforcement flexibility and gives it to federal courts, \nmeaning executive power is taken from the executive \nand given to the judiciary by the judiciary. The Court \nhas set a high bar for recognizing private rights in \nspending statutes\u2014and the any-qualified-provider \nprovision doesn\u2019t clear it. The Court should reverse. \n\n4 \n \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nI. \nStatutory background \nA. Congress passes the Medicaid Act to \nfund state medical programs. \nIn 1965, Congress created Medicaid, \u201ca federal \nprogram that subsidizes the States\u2019 provision of \nmedical services\u201d to families and individuals \u201cwhose \nincome and resources are insufficient to meet the \ncosts of necessary medical services.\u201d Armstrong v. \nExceptional Child Ctr., Inc., 575 U.S. 320, 323 (2015) \n(quoting 42 U.S.C. 1396-1). The program \u201cis a cooper-\native federal-state program that provides medical \ncare to needy individuals.\u201d Douglas v. Indep. Living \nCtr. of S. Cal., Inc., 565 U.S. 606, 610 (2012). \n\u201cLike other Spending Clause legislation, Medicaid \noffers the States a bargain: Congress provides federal \nfunds in exchange for the States\u2019 agreement to spend \nthem in accordance with congressionally imposed con-\nditions.\u201d Armstrong, 575 U.S. at 323. This is \u201ccoopera-\ntive federalism\u2014i.e., federal and state actors working \ntogether\u2014to carry out the statute\u2019s aims.\u201d Talevski, \n599 U.S. at 182 (cleaned up). States create plans and \nsubmit them to the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices for approval and disbursement of funds. 42 \nU.S.C. 1396-1. And if the Secretary later finds that a \nstate has failed to \u201ccomply substantially\u201d with the \nAct\u2019s requirements in the plan\u2019s administration, the \nSecretary may withhold all or part of the state\u2019s funds \nuntil \u201csatisfied that there will no longer be any such \nfailure to comply.\u201d 42 U.S.C. 1396c. \n\n5 \n \nB. Congress adds an any-qualified-provider \nprovision. \nTwo years later, Congress amended the Act to add \nSection 1396a(a)(23)(A) because some states were \nforcing recipients to choose from a very narrow list of \npublic providers. E.g., President\u2019s Proposals for \nRevision in the Social Security System, Hearing on \nH.R. 5710 before the H. Comm. On Ways and Means, \nPart 4 (April 6 and April 11, 1967), at 2273 (Puerto \nRico required Medicaid beneficiaries to receive care at \n\u201cgovernmental facilities\u201d); id. at 2301 (Massachusetts \nrefused to reimburse \u201cprivate physicians\u201d providing \ncare at teaching hospitals). \nThe new provision requires that state plans \n\u201cmust\u201d provide that \u201cany individual eligible for medi-\ncal assistance \u2026 may obtain\u201d it \u201cfrom any [provider] \nqualified to perform the service \u2026 who undertakes to \nprovide\u201d it. 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(23)(A). This provision \nis sometimes called \u201cthe \u2018any-qualified-provider\u2019 or \n\u2018free-choice-of-provider\u2019 provision.\u201d Planned Parent-\nhood of Greater Tex. Fam. Plan. & Preventive Health \nServs., Inc. v. Kauffman, 981 F.3d 347, 354 (5th Cir. \n2020) (en banc). But the former label is more accurate \nbecause the statute does not provide for a \u201cfree choice \nof provider\u201d\u2014beneficiaries may only choose from a \n\u201crange of qualified providers.\u201d O\u2019Bannon v. Town Ct. \nNursing Ctr., 447 U.S. 773, 785 (1980). \nThe Act does not define \u201cqualified.\u201d States retain \nbroad authority to exclude providers \u201cfor any reason \nfor which the Secretary could exclude the individual \nor entity from participation in\u201d the Medicare \nprogram, \u201c[i]n addition to any other authority\u201d states \npossess to exclude providers. 42 U.S.C. 1396a(p)(1). \n\n6 \n \nC. South Carolina creates remedies for \nexcluded providers. \nThe Medicaid Act contemplates that states will \nprovide administrative review and remedies for exclu-\nded providers. E.g., 42 U.S.C. 1396a(kk)(8)(B)(ii) (a \ntermination\u2019s effective date does not occur until \u201call \nappeal rights applicable to such termination have \nbeen exhausted or the timeline for any such appeal \nhas expired\u201d) (emphasis added). So federal regula-\ntions require they do so, mandating that an excluded \nindividual or entity have \u201cthe opportunity to submit \ndocuments and written argument against the exclu-\nsion,\u201d and requiring that the individual or entity \u201cbe \ngiven any additional appeals rights that would \notherwise be available under procedures established \nby the State.\u201d 42 C.F.R. 1002.213. \nAccordingly, South Carolina offers an administra-\ntive appeal with a hearing officer who can take testim-\nony and make findings of fact and conclusions of law. \nS.C. Code Regs. 126\u2013150, 126\u2013152, 126\u2013154. Provid-\ners may retain counsel. S.C. Code Regs. 126\u2013158. And \n\u201c[a]n appeal is not a rubberstamp process for agency \ndeterminations.\u201d S.C. DHHS, Appeals and Hearings \n101, at 3, perma.cc/TV2Y-Y6F2. A provider is also \nentitled to state-court review to determine whether \nthe decision violates statutory provisions or exceeds \nthe agency\u2019s authority, S.C. Code Ann. \u00a7 1-23-380, \nfollowed by this Court\u2019s review, if necessary. Respon-\ndent Planned Parenthood South Atlantic (PPSAT) \nagreed\u2014via its enrollment agreement\u2014that this \nprocess was its \u201cexclusive remedy.\u201d Appendix at A-\n115, A-139, Planned Parenthood S. Atlantic v. Baker, \nNo. 18-2133 (4th Cir. Nov. 26, 2018), ECF No. 15. \n\n7 \n \nII. Factual background \nA. PPSAT is deemed unqualified. \nOn July 13, 2018, South Carolina Governor Henry \nDargan McMaster issued an executive order directing \nthe State Department of Health and Human Services \nto (1) deem abortion providers unqualified to provide \nfamily-planning services under Medicaid, (2) termin-\nate their enrollment agreements, and (3) deny future \napplications from them. Pet.App.159a. That order is \nconsistent with S.C. Code Ann. \u00a7 43-5-1185, which \nprohibits using public funds to pay for abortions. \nBecause money is fungible, giving Medicaid dollars to \nabortion facilities frees up their other funds to provide \nmore abortions. So the Governor concluded that \u201cthe \npayment of taxpayer funds to abortion clinics, for any \npurpose, results in the subsidy of abortion and the \ndenial of the right to life.\u201d Pet.App.157a\u201358a. The \nsame day, the Department notified PPSAT that its en-\nrollment agreements were being terminated because \nit was no longer \u201cqualified to provide services to Medi-\ncaid beneficiaries.\u201d Pet.App.128a. PPSAT can restore \nMedicaid funding if it stops performing abortions\u2014\nbut it has chosen not to do so. \nPPSAT is affiliated with Planned Parenthood \nFederation of America, which provides operational \nand executive support to local offices like PPSAT. \nWhile both entities claim to offer a range of health-\ncare services, they mainly offer abortions, contracep-\ntion, STD testing, other screenings, and experimental \npuberty blockers and cross-sex hormones to those who \nidentify as transgender, including minors. In its most \nrecent annual report, the national entity reported \naborting nearly 400,000 children. Planned Parent-\n\n8 \n \nhood, Annual Report 2022\u201323 at 7, perma.cc/AX2E-\nZKRP. Year over year, Planned Parenthood is per-\nforming more abortions and fewer health services. \nMichael J. New, More Abortions, More Taxpayer \nDollars, and Fewer Health Services, National Review \n(Apr. 17, 2024), perma.cc/E89W-6WL9. \nPPSAT\u2019s two South Carolina locations offer only \ntwo prenatal/postpartum services: pregnancy tests \n(necessary for an abortion) and \u201cmiscarriage care\u201d \n(including treatments for women who intentionally \nterminate their pregnancies with abortion drugs).1 \nPPSAT does not deliver healthy babies or help women \nbecome pregnant, but the Columbia site does offer \nsubsidies for abortions it provides.2 And less than \nthree years before its Medicaid disqualification, \nPPSAT\u2019s Columbia site was threatened with closure \nfor \u201cnon-compliance with the Woman\u2019s Right to Know \nAct, incomplete medical and employee records, \nimproper infectious waste disposal practices, [and] \nfailure to report abortions to DHEC Vital Statistics in \n[a] timely manner, among other violations.\u201d3 \n \n1 Prenatal and Postpartum Services in Columbia, SC, Planned \nParenthood, perma.cc/H7J8-KK6J; Prenatal and Postpartum \nServices \nin \nCharleston, \nSC, \nPlanned \nParenthood, \nperma.cc/TQY4-XDDT. \n2 Pregnancy Testing and Planning in Columbia, SC, Planned \nParenthood, perma.cc/YVH6-ZAH5; Pregnancy Testing and \nPlanning \nin \nCharleston, \nSC, \nPlanned \nParenthood, \nperma.cc/AC5U-H5A6 (noting that the site refers out prenatal \ncare and adoption services); Abortion in Columbia, SC, Planned \nParenthood, perma.cc/C4Z9-75A5. \n3 Matthew Stevens,\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

The any-qualified-\nprovider provision, 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(23)(A), states \nin relevant part: \n(a) Contents \nA State plan for medical assistance must\u2014 \n* * * * * \n(23) provide that (A) any individual eligible \nfor medical assistance \u2026 may obtain such \nassistance from any [provider] qualified to \nperform the service or services required \u2026 \nwho undertakes to provide him such services \n\u2026. \n \n \n \n \n \n\n2 \n \nINTRODUCTION \nThe Medicaid Act is not a civil-rights statute. It \ncreates a cooperative-federalism program in which \n\u201cfederal and state actors work[ ] together \u2026 to carry \nout the statute\u2019s aims.\u201d Health & Hosp. Corp. of \nMarion Cnty. v. Talevski, 599 U.S. 166, 182 (2023). \nUnsurprisingly, the Act focuses on that relationship \nbetween the states and the federal government\u2014not \nthe creation of individual healthcare rights. Indeed, \nCongress wanted states to have substantial discretion \nto innovate with their Medicaid programs. So it made \nthe Act a substantial-compliance regime, giving the \nSecretary of the Department of Health & Human \nServices discretion whether to withhold funding when \na state\u2019s administration of its plan deviates from the \nAct\u2019s specifications. 42 U.S.C. 1396c(2). \nRespondents would have this Court transfer that \ndiscretion to the federal courts by implying a private \nright in the any-qualified-provider provision. But this \nCourt does not recognize private rights in federal \nstatutes \u201cas a matter of course.\u201d Talevski, 599 U.S. at \n183. And Spending Clause legislation, in particular, \nmust clear a \u201cdemanding bar\u201d: it \u201cmust unambig-\nuously confer individual federal rights.\u201d Id. at 180. \nAfter all, the typical remedy in this context \u201cis not a \nprivate cause of action for noncompliance but rather \naction by the Federal Government to terminate funds \nto the State.\u201d Id. at 183 (cleaned up). \nTo clear that high bar, it is not enough that Con-\ngress tried to benefit a specific class. Ibid. Instead, it \nis \u201ccritical\u201d that the statute\u2019s \u201ctext and structure\u201d use \n\u201cexplicit rights-creating terms.\u201d Gonzaga Univ. v. \nDoe, 536 U.S. 273, 284, 286\u201387 (2002). \n\n3 \n \nThe any-qualified-provider provision lacks any \n\u201cclear rights-creating language.\u201d Talevski, 599 U.S. at \n186 (cleaned up). Its text says merely that a plan must \nprovide that an \u201cindividual eligible for medical assis-\ntance\u201d \u201cmay obtain\u201d it from a \u201cqualified\u201d provider. 42 \nU.S.C. 1396a(a)(23)(A). There is no mention of \n\u201crights.\u201d And structurally, the provision is nestled in \na list labeled \u201cContents\u201d setting out 87 disparate \nitems that plans must include. 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a). \nThat text and structure is nothing like FNHRA\u2019s \nrights-creating provisions, which Talevski analyzed. \nTextually, those provisions involve (1) a nursing home \nresident\u2019s \u201cright to be free from\u201d restraints, 42 U.S.C. \n1396r(c)(1)(A)(ii) (emphasis added), and (2) conditions \nrelated to a resident\u2019s \u201c[t]ransfer and discharge \nrights,\u201d 42 U.S.C. 1396r(c)(2) (emphasis added). \nStructurally, both are listed in a bill of rights: \n\u201c[r]equirements relating to residents\u2019 rights.\u201d 42 \nU.S.C. 1396r(c) (emphasis added). And when FNHRA \ndiscusses the choice of a provider, it is unambiguous: \ndeclaring a resident\u2019s \u201cright\u201d \u201cto choose a personal \nattending physician.\u201d 42 U.S.C. 1396r(c)(1)(A)(i) \n(emphasis added). None of that is true here. \nReading a private right into the any-qualified-\nprovider provision would undermine the relationship \nbetween the states and the federal government. \nPrivate enforcement subjects states to unanticipated \n(and expensive) lawsuits. And it takes the Secretary\u2019s \nenforcement flexibility and gives it to federal courts, \nmeaning executive power is taken from the executive \nand given to the judiciary by the judiciary. The Court \nhas set a high bar for recognizing private rights in \nspending statutes\u2014and the any-qualified-provider \nprovision doesn\u2019t clear it. The Court should reverse. \n\n4 \n \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nI. \nStatutory background \nA. Congress passes the Medicaid Act to \nfund state medical programs. \nIn 1965, Congress created Medicaid, \u201ca federal \nprogram that subsidizes the States\u2019 provision of \nmedical services\u201d to families and individuals \u201cwhose \nincome and resources are insufficient to meet the \ncosts of necessary medical services.\u201d Armstrong v. \nExceptional Child Ctr., Inc., 575 U.S. 320, 323 (2015) \n(quoting 42 U.S.C. 1396-1). The program \u201cis a cooper-\native federal-state program that provides medical \ncare to needy individuals.\u201d Douglas v. Indep. Living \nCtr. of S. Cal., Inc., 565 U.S. 606, 610 (2012). \n\u201cLike other Spending Clause legislation, Medicaid \noffers the States a bargain: Congress provides federal \nfunds in exchange for the States\u2019 agreement to spend \nthem in accordance with congressionally imposed con-\nditions.\u201d Armstrong, 575 U.S. at 323. This is \u201ccoopera-\ntive federalism\u2014i.e., federal and state actors working \ntogether\u2014to carry out the statute\u2019s aims.\u201d Talevski, \n599 U.S. at 182 (cleaned up). States create plans and \nsubmit them to the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices for approval and disbursement of funds. 42 \nU.S.C. 1396-1. And if the Secretary later finds that a \nstate has failed to \u201ccomply substantially\u201d with the \nAct\u2019s requirements in the plan\u2019s administration, the \nSecretary may withhold all or part of the state\u2019s funds \nuntil \u201csatisfied that there will no longer be any such \nfailure to comply.\u201d 42 U.S.C. 1396c. \n\n5 \n \nB. Congress adds an any-qualified-provider \nprovision. \nTwo years later, Congress amended the Act to add \nSection 1396a(a)(23)(A) because some states were \nforcing recipients to choose from a very narrow list of \npublic providers. E.g., President\u2019s Proposals for \nRevision in the Social Security System, Hearing on \nH.R. 5710 before the H. Comm. On Ways and Means, \nPart 4 (April 6 and April 11, 1967), at 2273 (Puerto \nRico required Medicaid beneficiaries to receive care at \n\u201cgovernmental facilities\u201d); id. at 2301 (Massachusetts \nrefused to reimburse \u201cprivate physicians\u201d providing \ncare at teaching hospitals). \nThe new provision requires that state plans \n\u201cmust\u201d provide that \u201cany individual eligible for medi-\ncal assistance \u2026 may obtain\u201d it \u201cfrom any [provider] \nqualified to perform the service \u2026 who undertakes to \nprovide\u201d it. 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(23)(A). This provision \nis sometimes called \u201cthe \u2018any-qualified-provider\u2019 or \n\u2018free-choice-of-provider\u2019 provision.\u201d Planned Parent-\nhood of Greater Tex. Fam. Plan. & Preventive Health \nServs., Inc. v. Kauffman, 981 F.3d 347, 354 (5th Cir. \n2020) (en banc). But the former label is more accurate \nbecause the statute does not provide for a \u201cfree choice \nof provider\u201d\u2014beneficiaries may only choose from a \n\u201crange of qualified providers.\u201d O\u2019Bannon v. Town Ct. \nNursing Ctr., 447 U.S. 773, 785 (1980). \nThe Act does not define \u201cqualified.\u201d States retain \nbroad authority to exclude providers \u201cfor any reason \nfor which the Secretary could exclude the individual \nor entity from participation in\u201d the Medicare \nprogram, \u201c[i]n addition to any other authority\u201d states \npossess to exclude providers. 42 U.S.C. 1396a(p)(1). \n\n6 \n \nC. South Carolina creates remedies for \nexcluded providers. \nThe Medicaid Act contemplates that states will \nprovide administrative review and remedies for exclu-\nded providers. E.g., 42 U.S.C. 1396a(kk)(8)(B)(ii) (a \ntermination\u2019s effective date does not occur until \u201call \nappeal rights applicable to such termination have \nbeen exhausted or the timeline for any such appeal \nhas expired\u201d) (emphasis added). So federal regula-\ntions require they do so, mandating that an excluded \nindividual or entity have \u201cthe opportunity to submit \ndocuments and written argument against the exclu-\nsion,\u201d and requiring that the individual or entity \u201cbe \ngiven any additional appeals rights that would \notherwise be available under procedures established \nby the State.\u201d 42 C.F.R. 1002.213. \nAccordingly, South Carolina offers an administra-\ntive appeal with a hearing officer who can take testim-\nony and make findings of fact and conclusions of law. \nS.C. Code Regs. 126\u2013150, 126\u2013152, 126\u2013154. Provid-\ners may retain counsel. S.C. Code Regs. 126\u2013158. And \n\u201c[a]n appeal is not a rubberstamp process for agency \ndeterminations.\u201d S.C. DHHS, Appeals and Hearings \n101, at 3, perma.cc/TV2Y-Y6F2. A provider is also \nentitled to state-court review to determine whether \nthe decision violates statutory provisions or exceeds \nthe agency\u2019s authority, S.C. Code Ann. \u00a7 1-23-380, \nfollowed by this Court\u2019s review, if necessary. Respon-\ndent Planned Parenthood South Atlantic (PPSAT) \nagreed\u2014via its enrollment agreement\u2014that this \nprocess was its \u201cexclusive remedy.\u201d Appendix at A-\n115, A-139, Planned Parenthood S. Atlantic v. Baker, \nNo. 18-2133 (4th Cir. Nov. 26, 2018), ECF No. 15. \n\n7 \n \nII. Factual background \nA. PPSAT is deemed unqualified. \nOn July 13, 2018, South Carolina Governor Henry \nDargan McMaster issued an executive order directing \nthe State Department of Health and Human Services \nto (1) deem abortion providers unqualified to provide \nfamily-planning services under Medicaid, (2) termin-\nate their enrollment agreements, and (3) deny future \napplications from them. Pet.App.159a. That order is \nconsistent with S.C. Code Ann. \u00a7 43-5-1185, which \nprohibits using public funds to pay for abortions. \nBecause money is fungible, giving Medicaid dollars to \nabortion facilities frees up their other funds to provide \nmore abortions. So the Governor concluded that \u201cthe \npayment of taxpayer funds to abortion clinics, for any \npurpose, results in the subsidy of abortion and the \ndenial of the right to life.\u201d Pet.App.157a\u201358a. The \nsame day, the Department notified PPSAT that its en-\nrollment agreements were being terminated because \nit was no longer \u201cqualified to provide services to Medi-\ncaid beneficiaries.\u201d Pet.App.128a. PPSAT can restore \nMedicaid funding if it stops performing abortions\u2014\nbut it has chosen not to do so. \nPPSAT is affiliated with Planned Parenthood \nFederation of America, which provides operational \nand executive support to local offices like PPSAT. \nWhile both entities claim to offer a range of health-\ncare services, they mainly offer abortions, contracep-\ntion, STD testing, other screenings, and experimental \npuberty blockers and cross-sex hormones to those who \nidentify as transgender, including minors.

On the \u201cissue of \nwhether \u00a7 1396a(a)(23)(A) creates a private right of \naction enforceable through \u00a7 1983,\u201d the court applied \nthe so-called Blessing factors\u2014named for Blessing v. \nFreestone, 520 U.S. 329 (1997)\u2014and said that it does. \nPet.App.132a\u201336a. \n\n13 \n \nThe Fourth Circuit affirmed. In analyzing wheth-\ner \u201cCongress\u2019s intent to create an individual right \nenforceable under \u00a7 1983\u201d in the any-qualified-\nprovider provision is \u201cunambiguous,\u201d Pet.App.83a, \nthat court also applied the Blessing factors, assessed \nwhether Congress had \u201cforeclosed a \u00a7 1983 remedy,\u201d \nand then joined the circuits that had found \u201c a private \nright enforceable under \u00a7 1983.\u201d Pet.App.95a\u2013102a. \nThe court cited\u2014but did not discuss\u2014the Eighth \nCircuit\u2019s contrary holding in Does v. Gillespie, 867 \nF.3d 1034 (8th Cir. 2017). Pet.App.96a, 103a. \nConcurring, Judge Richardson wrote separately \nto call for clarity: \u201cWhat is the proper framework for \ndetermining whether a given statute creates a right \nthat is privately enforceable \u2026?\u201d Pet.App.121a. And \nmore specifically, has Wilder v. Virginia Hospital \nAssociation, 496 U.S. 498 (1990), \u201cbeen repudiated (or \neven effectively overruled)?\u201d Ibid. \nB. District court grants permanent injunc-\ntion, and the Fourth Circuit affirms. \nWhile a petition for certiorari was pending, the \ndistrict court granted summary judgment to Respond-\nents and directed them to submit a draft order \ngranting a permanent injunction. Pet.App.69a, 78a\u2013\n79a. Five days later, they filed a brief in this Court \narguing that the Court should deny the State\u2019s \npetition because it was about to become moot. Suppl. \nBr. for Resp\u2019ts, Baker v. Planned Parenthood S. Atl., \n141 S. Ct. 550 (2020) (No. 19-1186). And the Court \nsubsequently denied the petition. Baker, 141 S. Ct. \n550 (2020). \n \n\n14 \n \nMeanwhile, the district court entered an order \npermanently enjoining Petitioner from \u201cterminating \nor excluding\u201d PPSAT from South Carolina\u2019s Medicaid \nprogram based on its abortion activities. Pet.App.67a. \nAnd Petitioner appealed to the Fourth Circuit again. \nOn appeal, the Fourth Circuit acknowledged that \nthe en banc Fifth Circuit in Kauffman had recently \nheld that the any-qualified-provider provision does \nnot create private rights, Pet.App.51a\u201352a, but the \nFourth Circuit still refused to \u201creconsider [its] \nprevious panel decision,\u201d Pet.App.51a. \nConcurring only in the judgment, Judge Richard-\nson wrote separately to implore this Court to clear up \nthe \u201cconfusion and uncertainty\u201d in the caselaw. \nPet.App.65a. \u201cGonzaga arguably laid down a different \ntest than Wilder and Blessing,\u201d he explained. Ibid. \nBut until this Court plainly repudiates them, lower \ncourts \u201cremain[ ] bound by Blessing and Wilder.\u201d Ibid. \nThe State filed a second petition for certiorari. \nC. After a GVR, the Fourth Circuit affirms \nagain. \nTwo months later, the Court granted certiorari in \nTalevski. Its opinion reaffirmed that \u201cGonzaga sets \nforth [the Court\u2019s] established method for ascer-\ntaining unambiguous conferral\u201d of private rights in \nthe Spending Clause context. Talevski, 599 U.S. at \n183. But the Court said nothing about the ongoing \nvalidity of Wilder or Blessing. The Court then GVR\u2019d \nthis case. Pet.App.37a. \n \n\n15 \n \nOn remand, the Fourth Circuit reaffirmed its \nprior decisions. Pet.App.12a\u201313a. Talevski, the court \nwrote, \u201coffered an illuminating analysis\u201d and \u201ca useful \nnew example of provisions enforceable via \u00a7 1983,\u201d \nbut the court did \u201cnot read it as toppling the existing \ndoctrinal regime.\u201d Pet.App.4a. Wilder remained good \nlaw, and the court (wrongly) thought that it \u201cwould \nappear to doom the State\u2019s argument at the starting \ngate.\u201d Pet.App.27a\u201328a. Finally, while Talevski had \n\u201cshed some new light on Blessing,\u201d it was not the \nFourth Circuit\u2019s \u201cprerogative to proclaim a Supreme \nCourt precedent overthrown.\u201d Pet.App.21a\u201322a.  \nAgain concurring only in the judgment, Judge \nRichardson noted that he had written separately \ntwice before \u201cto ask for clarity on the precedential \nstatus of Wilder \u2026 and, to a lesser extent, Blessing.\u201d \nPet.App.35a. He did so for a third time \u201cbecause even \nafter [Talevski],\u201d lower courts still \u201clack the guidance \ninferior judges need.\u201d Pet.App.35a\u201336a. They \u201clack \nsufficiently clear signals to be sure [this] Court has \ndiscarded Wilder\u2019s holding (or Blessing\u2019s test).\u201d \nPet.App.36a n.2. So the court was \u201cbound to stand by \n[its] previous holding.\u201d Pet.App.36a. \nThis Court granted certiorari. \n \n \n\n16 \n \nSUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT \nThis Court has set a high bar for finding that a \nSpending Clause statute confers a federal right enfor-\nceable under Section 1983. The Medicaid Act\u2019s any-\nqualified-provider provision doesn\u2019t clear it. Congress \nmust speak with a \u201cclear voice\u201d and an \u201cunambiguous \nintent to confer individual rights\u201d for such a provision \nto confer a private right. Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at 280 \n(cleaned up). Congress must use unambiguously clear \nrights-creating language. Congress did not use such \nlanguage in the any-qualified-provider provision; the \nprovision says nothing about rights at all. \nTo date, this Court has identified only four provi-\nsions with clear rights-creating language: the two \nresidents\u2019-rights provisions in Talevski and the two \n\u201cNo person shall\u201d provisions in Title VI of the Civil \nRights Act of 1964 and Title IX of the Education \nAmendments of 1972. Congress used such language \nin Talevski by labeling the benefits conferred there as \n\u201crights.\u201d And the \u201cNo person shall\u201d language in Titles \nVI and IX\u2014two civil-rights statutes\u2014closely mirrors \nthe text of the Fifth Amendment. \nIn contrast, the any-qualified-provider provision, \nwhich says only that \u201cany individual \u2026 may obtain\u201d \nassistance from any \u201cqualified\u201d provider, does not \nspeak about \u201crights\u201d or use clear rights-creating \nlanguage lifted from the Constitution\u2019s Bill of Rights. \nAbsent such language, the \u201ctypical remedy for state \nnoncompliance with federally imposed conditions is \nnot a private cause of action \u2026 but rather action by \nthe Federal Government to terminate funds to the \nState.\u201d Pennhurst State Sch. & Hosp. v. Halderman, \n451 U.S. 1, 28 (1981). \n\n17 \n \nThis Court has carefully cabined prior opinions \nthat some lower courts have read to establish \u201ca \nrelatively loose standard for finding rights enforce-\nable by \u00a7 1983.\u201d Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at 282. But while \nthe Court has abandoned the so-called Blessing \nfactors and limited Wilder and Wright v. City of \nRoanoke Redevelopment and Housing Authority, 479 \nU.S. 418 (1987), to their facts, the Court has not yet \nexpressly overruled them or explicitly said that it has \nabandoned them. And that has left lower courts won-\ndering if they\u2019re bound to apply them. This case is a \nchance to provide much-needed clarity: the Court \nshould reiterate that it has abandoned Blessing\u2019s \nmulti-factored test and limited Wright and Wilder to \nspecific facts not implicated here. The Court should \nthen apply Gonzaga and Talevski and reverse. \nARGUMENT \nI. \nThe any-qualified-provider provision does \nnot create a private right.  \nA. Only clear rights-creating terms create a \nprivate right in spending laws. \nThe \u201clegitimacy\u201d of Congress\u2019s exercise of its \nspending power depends on a state\u2019s voluntary and \nknowing acceptance of terms. Pennhurst, 451 U.S. at \n17. \u201cRespecting this limitation is critical to ensuring \nthat Spending Clause legislation does not undermine \nthe status of the States as independent sovereigns in \nour federal system.\u201d Nat\u2019l Fed\u2019n of Indep. Bus. v. \nSebelius, 567 U.S. 519, 577 (2012) (Roberts, C.J., \nplurality). So \u201cif Congress intends to impose a con-\ndition on the grant of federal moneys, it must do so \nunambiguously.\u201d Pennhurst, 451 U.S. at 17. \n\n18 \n \nAbiding by that \u201cwell-established requirement\u201d \nensures states receive the \u201cclear notice\u201d they deserve. \nTalevski, 599 U.S. at 180 n.8. And \u201c[b]y insisting that \nCongress speak with a clear voice,\u201d the Court enables \nstates to \u201cexercise their choice knowingly, cognizant \nof the consequences of their participation.\u201d Pennhurst, \n451 U.S. at 17. \nThat clear-statement rule applies when a private \nparty claims an enforceable right based on a provision \nin a Spending Clause statute like the Medicaid Act. \n\u201c[U]nless Congress speaks with a clear voice and \nmanifests an unambiguous intent to confer individual \nrights, federal funding provisions provide no basis for \nprivate enforcement by \u00a7 1983.\u201d Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at \n280 (cleaned up). That makes sense because Section \n1983 creates a cause of action for \u201cthe deprivation of \nany rights, privileges, or immunities secured by\u201d \nfederal law. 42 U.S.C. 1983 (emphasis added). \nAt least since Gonzaga, this Court has been clear \nthat it will not \u201cpermit anything short of an unambig-\nuously conferred right to support a cause of action \nbrought under \u00a7 1983.\u201d 536 U.S. at 283. As the Court \nreiterated in Talevski, that is a \u201cdemanding bar\u201d and \na \u201csignificant hurdle.\u201d 599 U.S. at 180, 184; accord id. \nat 193 (Barrett, J., concurring) (\u201cThis bar is high, and \nalthough the FNHRA clears it, many federal statutes \nwill not.\u201d); id. at 230 (Alito, J., dissenting) (agreeing \nabout the \u201chigh bar\u201d). \n \n \n \n\n19 \n \nSection \u201c1983 actions are the exception\u2014not the \nrule\u2014for violations of Spending Clause statutes.\u201d Id. \nat 193\u201394 (Barrett, J., concurring). So the question is \n\u201cwhether this is the atypical case\u201d in which a \nSpending Clause provision \u201cunambiguously confer[s] \nindividual rights, making those rights presumptively \nenforceable under \u00a7 1983.\u201d Id. at 183 (emphasis \nadded) (cleaned up). It is not. \n\u201cGonzaga sets forth [the Court\u2019s] established \nmethod for ascertaining unambiguous conferral.\u201d \nTalevski, 599 U.S. at 183. Under that test, it\u2019s not \nenough that a \u201cplaintiff falls within the general zone \nof interest that the statute is intended to protect.\u201d \nGonzaga, 536 U.S. at 283. Rather, a court must exam-\nine the statute\u2019s \u201ctext and structure\u201d and determine \nwhether a plaintiff has made the \u201ccritical\u201d showing \u201cof \n\u2018rights-creating\u2019 language.\u201d Id. at 286, 287 (emphasis \nadded) (citing Alexander v. Sandoval, 532 U.S. 275, \n288\u201389 (2001), and Cannon v. Univ. of Chi., 441 U.S. \n677, 690 n.13 (1979)). \nAnd if a provision does have clear rights-creating \nlanguage, a plaintiff still must show that such lan-\nguage is \u201cphrased in terms of the persons benefitted,\u201d \nwith \u201can unmistakable focus on the benefitted class.\u201d \nGonzaga, 536 U.S. at 284, 287 (cleaned up); accord \nUniversities Rsch. Ass\u2019n, Inc. v. Coutu, 450 U.S. 754, \n772 n.23 (1981) (quoting U.S. for Benefit & on Behalf \nof Glynn v. Capeletti Bros., 621 F.2d 1309, 1314 (5th \nCir. 1980)). That means \u201cthe Gonzaga test is satisfied \nwhere the provision in question [1] is phrased in \nterms of the persons benefitted\u201d \u201cwith an unmistak-\nable focus on the benefited class\u201d \u201cand [2] contains \nrights-creating, individual-centric language.\u201d Talev-\nski, 599 U.S. at 183 (emphasis added) (cleaned up). \n\n20 \n \nIn sum, the \u201cquestion is not simply who would \nbenefit from the Act, but whether Congress intended \nto confer federal rights upon those beneficiaries.\u201d \nCalifornia v. Sierra Club, 451 U.S. 287, 294 (1981). \nAnd \u201crights-creating language\u201d is \u201ccritical\u201d to that \nshowing. Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at 287 (cleaned up). \nB. The \nany-qualified-provider \nprovision \nlacks clear rights-creating language. \nThe any-qualified-provider provision has nothing \napproaching the \u201cclear rights-creating language\u201d that \nwould make this the \u201catypical case.\u201d Talevski, 599 \nU.S. at 183, 186 (cleaned up). The provision requires \nonly that state plans provide that \u201cany individual \neligible for medical assistance \u2026 may obtain such \nassistance from any institution, agency, community \npharmacy, or person, qualified to perform the service \nor services required \u2026 who undertakes to provide \u2026 \nsuch services.\u201d 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(23)(A). \nFirst and foremost, the text never mentions the \nword \u201cright\u201d or its functional equivalent. Compare \nwith Talevski, 599 U.S. at 184\u201385 (residents\u2019 \u201cright to \nbe free from\u201d restraints; \u201ctransfer and discharge \nrights\u201d) (cleaned up). Nor is it framed using the \nrights-creating \u201cNo person shall\u201d language Congress \nborrowed from the Bill of Rights when it enacted the \ncivil-rights statutes contained in Titles VI and IX. \nViewed contextually, the provision also does not \n\u201creside in\u201d a part of the Medicaid Act that \u201cexpressly \nconcerns\u201d requirements \u201crelating to [beneficiaries\u2019] \nrights.\u201d Talevski, 599 U.S. at 184 (cleaned up). \nInstead, it resides in 42 U.S.C. 1396a, titled \u201cState \nplans for medical assistance,\u201d under subsection (a), \nwhich is simply titled \u201cContents.\u201d 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a). \n\n21 \n \nThe provision also limits the scope of the benefit \nto \u201cqualified\u201d providers while later acknowledging the \nstates\u2019 authority to decide what makes a provider \nqualified. See 42 U.S.C. 1396a(p)(1) (\u201cIn addition to \nany other authority, a State may exclude any indi-\nvidual or entity for purposes of participating under \nthe State plan under this subchapter for any reason \nfor which the Secretary could exclude the individual \nor entity \u2026.\u201d) (emphasis added). Letting the regulated \nentity\u2014here the state\u2014decide the scope of the right \nwould be an odd way to bestow a right. For example, \nit would have made no sense for the Framers to \nqualify the First Amendment\u2019s Free Speech Clause by \nallowing the regulated entity\u2014Congress\u2014to define \nwhat qualifies as \u201cspeech.\u201d U.S. Const. amend. I. Or \nfor Congress to qualify Title IX by allowing the \nregulated entities\u2014schools\u2014to define what counts as \n\u201cdiscrimination.\u201d 20 U.S.C. 1681(a). Or for Congress \nin FNHRA to allow nursing homes to decide what \ncounts as \u201crestraints.\u201d 42 U.S.C. 1396r(c)(1)(A)(ii). \nTrue rights-creating language doesn\u2019t work that way. \nWhat\u2019s more, the provision speaks of \u201cobtain[ing]\u201d \na benefit from a third party. But that\u2019s quite unlike \nclear rights-creating language, which confers a right \ndirectly and in explicit terms. For example, FNHRA \ndid not say that any resident in a covered nursing \nhome \u201cmay obtain\u201d an environment free of physical or \nchemical restraints. Nor did it say that any resident \n\u201cmay obtain\u201d advance notice of a transfer or dis-\ncharge. Likewise, Congress did not write Title IX to \nsay any citizen \u201cmay obtain\u201d the benefits of a federally \nfunded education program free of sex discrimination. \nWhen Congress wants to create a private right, it \nconfers that right expressly and directly. \n\n22 \n \nTellingly, in enacting Section 1396a, Congress \nspecifically did invoke the words \u201cright\u201d and \u201crights\u201d \nin several places\u2014five times in the context of pay-\nments and a few more in the context of whistle-\nblowers, notifications about the right to accept or \nrefuse treatment, and the disregard of certain \nproperty in determining the eligibility of Indians. 42 \nU.S.C. \n1396a(a)(25)(H)\u2013(I), \n(a)(45), \n(a)(68)(C), \n(w)(1)(A), (ff)(3)\u2013(4). The only other mentions of \n\u201crights\u201d in Section 1396a are when Congress is discus-\nsing administrative appeals, both for individuals, 42 \nU.S.C. 1396a(ee)(4), and for providers, 42 U.S.C. \n1396a(kk)(8)(B). \nCongress chose not to mention rights when direct-\ning participating states to include the any-qualified-\nprovider provision in their plans. So at best, Respon-\ndents have to infer that Congress created a private \nright. And \u201can inference is not \u2018an unambiguously \nconferred right.\u2019\u201d Kauffman, 981 F.3d at 360 (quoting \nGonzaga, 536 U.S. at 283); accord 31 Foster Child. v. \nBush, 329 F.3d 1255, 1270 (11th Cir. 2003) \n(\u201cAmbiguity precludes enforceable rights.\u201d). \nOn its plain text, then, the any-qualified-provider \nprovision, like many statutes, may confer a benefit. \nAnd Ms. Edwards may even be within the statute\u2019s \nzone of interests. But that\u2019s not enough to unambigu-\nously confer a private right. The provision\u2019s text and \nstructure are devoid of any language resembling what \nthis Court has deemed clear rights-creating language. \nGonzaga\u2019s \u201cdemanding bar,\u201d Talevski, 599 U.S. at 180 \n(citing Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at 280), requires far more. \n\n23 \n \nC. The Court should retain its bright lines \nabout what qualifies as clear rights-\ncreating language. \nThus far, this Court has limited \u201cclear rights-\ncreating language\u201d to statutes where Congress \nexplicitly uses the label \u201cright\u201d or lifts language from \nthe rights-creating provisions of the Constitution. To \nkeep Gonzaga\u2019s bar \u201cdemanding,\u201d the Court should \nhold that line. The any-qualified-provider provision \nfalls far short, as this Court\u2019s precedents prove.  \n1. Talevski proves Congress can clearly \nconfer a private right by explicitly \nlabeling a benefit a \u201cright.\u201d  \nIn Talevski, this Court held that two provisions of \nFNHRA that explicitly reference \u201crights of nursing- \nhome residents to be free from unnecessary\u201d \nrestraints and to receive pre-discharge notice \u201cunam-\nbiguously create \u00a7 1983-enforceable rights.\u201d 599 U.S. \nat 171\u201372 (emphasis added). The provisions satisfied \n\u201cGonzaga\u2019s stringent standard\u201d given their \u201cclear \nrights-creating language.\u201d Id. at 186 (cleaned up). \n\u201cTo start, \u2026 both [the unnecessary-restraint and \npredischarge-notice provision] reside in 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1396r(c), which expressly concerns \u2018[r]equirements \nrelating to residents\u2019 rights.\u2019\u201d Id. at 184 (quoting 42 \nU.S.C. 1396r(c)). As this Court explained it, \u201c[t]his \nframing is indicative of an individual \u2018rights-creating\u2019 \nfocus.\u201d Ibid. (quoting Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at 284). \n\u201cExamined further,\u201d the provisions\u2019 text \u201cunambig-\nuously confers rights upon the residents of nursing-\nhome facilities.\u201d Ibid. \n\n24 \n \nThe unnecessary-restraint provision appears in a \nstatutory subsection called \u201cGeneral rights\u201d and in a \nsubsubsection titled \u201cSpecified rights.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \n1396r(c)(1)(A) (emphasis added). That provision \nrequires nursing homes to \u201cprotect and promote\u201d the \nrights of each resident, including \u201c[t]he right to be free \nfrom \u2026 any physical or chemical restraints \u2026 not \nrequired to treat the resident\u2019s medical symptoms.\u201d \nTalevski, 599 U.S. at 184 (quoting 42 U.S.C. \n1396r(c)(1)(A)(ii)). The provision sits alongside addi-\ntional provisions that protect \u201c[t]he right to choose a \npersonal attending physician\u201d (more on this in a \nmoment), \u201c[t]he right to privacy,\u201d \u201c[t]he right to \nconfidentiality,\u201d the \u201cright \u2026 to reside and receive \nservices with reasonable accommodation of individual \nneeds,\u201d \u201c[t]he right \u2026 to receive notice before the \nroom or roommate of the resident in the facility is \nchanged,\u201d \u201c[t]he right to voice grievances,\u201d \u201c[t]he right \nof the resident to organize and participate in resident \ngroups,\u201d \u201cthe right of the resident\u2019s family to meet in \nthe facility,\u201d \u201c[t]he right of the resident to participate \nin social, religious, and community activities,\u201d \u201c[t]he \nright to examine\u201d facility survey results, \u201c[t]he right \nto refuse a transfer to another room,\u201d and \u201c[a]ny other \nright established by the Secretary.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \n1396r(c)(1)(A)(i), (iii)-(xi) (emphasis added). FNHRA \nrefers to these as \u201clegal rights.\u201d Id. at (c)(1)(B)(i), (iv). \nThe \u201cpredischarge-notice provision is more of the \nsame.\u201d Talevski, 599 U.S. at 184. \u201cNestled in a para-\ngraph concerning \u2018transfer and discharge rights,\u2019 that \nprovision tells nursing facilities that they \u2018must not \ntransfer or discharge [a] resident\u2019 unless certain \npreconditions are met, including advance notice \u2026 to \nthe resident and his or her family.\u201d Id. at 184\u201385 \n\n25 \n \n(quoting 42 U.S.C. 1396r(c)(2)) (cleaned up); accord id. \nat 192 (Gorsuch, J., concurring) (\u201c[T]he text of the \nAct\u2019s operative provisions refers to individual \n\u2018rights.\u2019\u201d). And before effecting a transfer or discharge, \nFNHRA requires the nursing home to provide a notice \nthat must include \u201cnotice of the resident\u2019s right to \nappeal the transfer or discharge.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \n1396r(c)(2)(B)(i), (iii). \nAs a result, \u201cthe text of the unnecessary-restraint \nand predischarge-notice provisions unambiguously \nconfer[ ] rights upon the residents.\u201d Talevski, 599 U.S. \nat 184. Those provisions \u201cstand in stark contrast to \nthe statutory provisions that failed Gonzaga\u2019s test in \nGonzaga itself.\u201d Id. at 185.  \nConversely, the any-qualified-provider provision \nnever mentions the word \u201cright\u201d or its equivalent. To \nbe sure, the phrase \u201cmay obtain \u2026 assistance\u201d might \nconfer a benefit. But that is not enough under Talev-\nski and Gonzaga. \u201c[I]t is rights, not the broader or \nvaguer \u2018benefits\u2019 or \u2018interests,\u2019 that may be enforced\u201d \nunder Section 1983. Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at 283. \nDriving that point home, FNHRA proves that \nCongress knows how to use clear rights-creating lan-\nguage in a Spending Clause provision when it wants \nto confer the right to choose a healthcare provider. As \nnoted above, in the same subsection that this Court \nanalyzed in Talevski\u2014\u201cRequirements relating to \nresidents\u2019 rights\u201d\u2014Congress required that a \u201cnursing \nfacility must protect and promote the rights of each \nresident, including\u201d the \u201cright[ ]\u201d of \u201cFree choice,\u201d \nstarting with the \u201cright to choose a personal attending \nphysician.\u201d 42 U.S.C. 1396r(c)(1)(A)(i) (emphasis \nadded). \n\n26 \n \nThe text and structure of the any-qualified-\nprovider provision contain no such rights-creating \nlanguage. And Congress\u2019s \u201cuse of explicit language in \nother statutes cautions against inferring\u201d Congress \nintended to say something it didn\u2019t say in the statute \nunder consideration. Marx v. Gen. Revenue Corp., 568 \nU.S. 371, 384 (2013). If that\u2019s true where \u201cexplicit \nlanguage\u201d is not required, ibid., then in a context like \nthis one, where explicit rights-creating language is \nrequired, the absence of that language\u2014coupled with \nits presence in statutes like FNHRA\u2014is dispositive. \nSee Sandoval, 532 U.S. at 288 (\u201cWe therefore begin \n(and find that we can end) our search for Congress\u2019s \nintent with the text and structure of Title VI.\u201d). \n2. Titles VI and IX prove Congress can \nclearly confer a private right by \nusing text from the rights-creating \nprovisions of the U.S. Constitution. \nThe two rights-creating provisions this Court \nidentified in Gonzaga\u2014Title VI and Title IX\u2014confirm \nCongress knows how to use clear rights-creating lan-\nguage. As Gonzaga recognized, both contain \u201cexplicit\u201d \nrights-creating terms. 536 U.S. at 284 n.3. \u201cTitle VI \nprovides: \u2018No person in the United States shall ... be \nsubjected to discrimination under any program or \nactivity receiving Federal financial assistance\u2019 on the \nbasis of race, color, or national origin.\u201d Ibid. (quoting \n42 U.S.C. 2000d) (emphasis added in Gonzaga). And \n\u201cTitle IX provides: \u2018No person in the United \nStates shall, on the basis of sex, ... be subjected to dis-\ncrimination under any education program or activity \nreceiving Federal financial assistance.\u2019\u201d Ibid. (quoting \n20 U.S.C. 1681(a)) (emphasis added in Gonzaga). \n\n27 \n \nThis Court\u2019s conclusion that the phrase \u201cNo \nperson shall,\u201d located in two civil-rights statutes, \nqualifies as clear rights-creating language follows \nnaturally from the phrase\u2019s deeply rooted, rights-\ncreating pedigree. The U.S. Constitution\u2019s Bill of \nRights and analogous provisions in nearly all the \nstates\u2019 constitutions have included that phrase for \ncenturies. See U.S. Const. amend. V (\u201cNo person shall \n\u2026\u201d); John T. McNaughton, The Privilege against Self-\nIncrimination, 51 J. Crim. L. Criminology & Police \nSci. 138, 139 (1960) (noting that \u201cthe constitutions of \nall but two states\u201d contain verbatim \u201cNo person shall\u201d \nlanguage or its equivalent).  \nBy contrast, the any-qualified-provider provision \ncontains no such clear rights-creating language. \nAlthough the court below thought the phrase \u201cany \nindividual\u201d \u201cclosely mirrors\u201d the \u201cNo person \u2026 shall\u201d \nphrasing highlighted in Gonzaga, Pet.App.57a, that \nconclusion is fatally flawed.  \nCongress could have drawn on the rights-creating \npedigree of the phrase \u201cNo person shall\u201d and required \nstate plans to provide that \u201cno person shall be denied \nthe free choice of any provider qualified to perform the \nrequired services.\u201d But Congress did not write that. \nInstead, it used \u201cmay\u201d in place of the more traditional \nrights-creating \u201cshall,\u201d it limited the scope of the class \nto \u201celigible\u201d individuals, it gave states authority to \ndecide what makes a provider \u201cqualified,\u201d and it spoke \nof \u201cobtain[ing]\u201d a benefit from a third party. \nDespite all this, Respondents have argued that \nthe any-qualified-provider provision should be read as \nthough it were written like Titles VI and IX, but this \nCourt usually does not \u201cread into statutes words that \n\n28 \n \naren\u2019t there.\u201d Romag Fasteners, Inc v. Fossil, Inc., 590 \nU.S. 212, 215 (2020). Accord Morse v. Republican \nParty of Va., 517 U.S. 186, 286\u201388 (1996) (Thomas, J., \ndissenting, joined by Rehnquist, C.J., Scalia, J., and \nin relevant part, Kennedy, J.) (concluding, pre-\nGonzaga, that Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act \ncontained a private right of action but Section 10 did \nnot because only the former used the familiar \u201cno \nperson shall\u201d term of art). \nNor can Respondents transform the any-\nqualified-provider provision into a \u201cfree-choice-of-\nprovider provision\u201d simply by attaching that label to \nit. Contra Opp.i (adopting this label and inserting it \ninto the first question presented). The provision\u2019s text \ndoes not contain the phrase \u201cfree choice,\u201d much less \nthe clear rights-creating language in Titles VI and IX. \nStretching the text, Respondents try to \u201cconjure up a \nprivate [right] that has not been authorized by \nCongress.\u201d Sandoval, 532 U.S. at 291. But the \nabsence of \u201cclear rights-creating language\u201d calls the \nCourt to reject that effort. Talevski, 599 U.S. at 186. \n3. Absent such explicit rights-creating \nlanguage, spending statutes do not \ncreate private rights, as this Court\u2019s \nprecedents prove.  \nIn Gonzaga, a student sued his private university \nunder Section 1983 to enforce provisions in FERPA \n\u201cprohibit[ing] the federal funding of educational insti-\ntutions that [had] a policy or practice of releasing \neducation records to unauthorized persons.\u201d Gonzaga, \n536 U.S. at 276. One provision stated: \n\n29 \n \nNo funds shall be made available under any \napplicable program to any educational agency \nor institution which has a policy or practice of \npermitting the release of education records (or \npersonally identifiable information contained \ntherein \u2026) of students without the written \nconsent of their parents to any individual, \nagency, or organization.  \nId. at 279 (quoting 20 U.S.C. 1232g(b)(1)). \nA second added that \u201c[n]o funds shall be made \navailable\u201d to educational entities with \u201ca policy or \npractice of releasing, or providing access to, [certain] \npersonally identifiable information \u2026 unless\u2014there is \nwritten consent from the student\u2019s parents \u2026 with a \ncopy of the records to be released to the student\u2019s \nparents and the student if desired by the parents\u201d or a \ncourt order approving the release.\u201d 20 U.S.C. \n1232g(b)(2) (emphasis added). \nThe \nGonzaga \ndissent \nthought \nthe \nsecond \nprovision \u201cplainly [met] the standards\u201d this Court \n\u201carticulated in Blessing for establishing a federal \nright.\u201d Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at 295 (Stevens, J., dissent-\ning). It was \u201cdirected to the benefit of individual \nstudents and parents,\u201d it was \u201cbinding on States,\u201d it \nwas \u201ccouched in mandatory, rather than precatory, \nterms,\u201d it was \u201cfar from vague and amorphous,\u201d and \nit spoke \u201cof the individual \u2018student,\u2019 not students \ngenerally.\u201d Ibid. (cleaned up). The dissent also high-\nlighted the \u201crights-creating language in the title\u201d of \nFERPA\u2014the Family Educational Rights and Privacy \nAct\u2014the \u201ctext of the Act,\u201d and its \u201coverall context.\u201d Id. \nat 293, 296. \n\n30 \n \nDespite all that, this Court held it was not \nenough. The provisions \u201clack[ed] the sort of \u2018rights-\ncreating\u2019 language critical to showing the requisite \ncongressional intent to create new rights.\u201d Id. at 287. \nInstead, the Act spoke \u201conly to the Secretary of \nEducation, directing that \u2018[n]o funds shall be made \navailable\u2019 to any \u2018educational agency or institution\u2019\u201d \nwith \u201ca prohibited \u2018policy or practice.\u2019\u201d Ibid. (quoting \n20 U.S.C. 1232g(b)(1)). And that made the Act\u2019s \u201cfocus \n\u2026 two steps removed from the interests of individual \nstudents and parents.\u201d Ibid. \nRespondents\u2019 arguments here sound like the Gon-\nzaga dissent. Though the any-qualified-provider \nprovision is a directive and uses the word \u201cindivid-\nual,\u201d the text lacks \u201c\u2018rights-creating\u2019 language,\u201d and \nspeaks only to the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices. \nCompare \nibid. \nThat \nmakes \nSection \n1395a(a)(23) two steps removed from the interests of \nbeneficiaries. Ibid. \n\u201cThe Court consistently has found that Congress \nintended to create a cause of action \u2018where the \nlanguage of the statute explicitly confers a right \ndirectly on a class of persons that includes the \nplaintiff in the case.\u2019\u201d Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & \nSmith, Inc. v. Curran, 456 U.S. 353, 391 n.91 (1982) \n(emphasis added) (cleaned up) (quoting Cannon, 441 \nU.S. at 690 n.13). Conversely, it has noted that there \n\u201cwould be far less reason to infer a private remedy in \nfavor of individual persons\u201d where Congress, rather \nthan drafting the legislation \u201cwith an unmistakable \nfocus on the benefited class,\u201d has framed the statute \nsimply as a general prohibition or a command to a \nfederal agency. Coutu, 450 U.S. at 771\u201373 (citing \nCannon, 441 U.S. at 690\u201392 & n.13). \n\n31 \n \nSimilarly, in Coutu, the Court addressed the \nprivate enforceability of minimum-wage provisions in \nthe Davis-Bacon Act that are analogous to the any-\nqualified-provider provision. 450 U.S. at 756\u201357. The \nlead provisions there required that advertised specifi-\ncations for certain federal construction contracts \n\u201cshall contain a provision stating the minimum wages \nto be paid various classes of laborers and mechanics \nwhich shall be based\u201d on the prevailing rates for lab-\norers and mechanics working on similar projects. Id. \nat 756\u201357 (quoting what are now located at 40 U.S.C. \n3142(a) and (b)) (emphasis added). A separate pro-\nvision added that \u201c[e]very contract based upon these \nspecifications must contain a stipulation that the \ncontractor shall pay wages not less than those stated \nin the specifications.\u201d Id. at 757 (emphasis added) \n(describing what is now located at 40 U.S.C. 3142(c)). \nThis Court had previously \u201crecognized that on its \nface, the Act is a minimum wage law designed for the \nbenefit of construction workers.\u201d Id. at 771 (cleaned \nup). But that \u201cdesign[ ]\u201d did \u201cnot end the inquiry.\u201d \nIbid. Instead, the Court asked \u201cwhether the language \nof the statute indicates that Congress intended that it \nbe enforced through private litigation.\u201d Ibid. That \nintent exists only \u201c\u2018where the language of the statute \nexplicitly confer[s] a right directly on a class of persons \nthat include[s] the plaintiff.\u201d Id. at 772 (emphasis \nadded) (quoting Cannon, 441 U.S. at 690 n.13). \n\u201cConversely,\u201d no private cause of action arises \nwhen Congress \u201cframe[s] the statute simply as a gen-\neral prohibition or a command to a federal agency.\u201d \nIbid. (quoting Cannon, 441 U.S. at 690\u201392). And \nthat\u2019s what Congress did in \u201cSection 1 of the Davis-\nBacon Act,\u201d which required \u201ccertain stipulations be \n\n32 \n \nplaced in federal construction contracts for the benefit \nof mechanics and laborers, but [did] not confer rights \ndirectly on those individuals.\u201d Ibid. Given that \nomission, the Act\u2019s language \u201cprovide[d] no support \nfor the implication of a private remedy.\u201d Id. at 773. \nSo too here. Congress directed the Secretary to \n\u201capprove any plan which fulfills the conditions\u201d in \n1396a(a), including that a \u201cState plan for medical \nassistance must \u2026 provide that \u2026 any individual \neligible for medical assistance \u2026 may obtain such \nassistance from any \u2026 qualified\u201d provider. 42 U.S.C. \n1396a(b), (a)(23). That condition may have been \n\u201cdesigned to benefit a particular class,\u201d like the Davis-\nBacon Act was designed to benefit mechanics and \nlaborers, but that \u201cdoes not end the inquiry.\u201d Coutu, \n450 U.S. at 771. It also may have been stated as a \nmandatory component, like the Davis-Bacon Act was. \nId. at 757 (describing stipulations that contracts \n\u201cmust contain\u201d). But as Coutu proves, that is not \nenough to create a privately enforceable right where, \nas here, a statute is framed \u201csimply as \u2026 a command \nto a federal agency\u201d and does not \u201c\u2018explicitly confer[ ] \na right directly on a class of persons that include[s] \nthe plaintiff in the case.\u2019\u201d Id. at 772 (quoting Cannon, \n441 U.S. at 690 n.13). \nUltimately, the question is \u201cone of congressional \nintent, not one of whether this Court thinks it can \nimprove upon the statutory scheme that Congress \nenacted into law.\u201d Id. at 770 (cleaned up). As for the \nany-qualified-provider provision\u2019s text, Congress\u2019s \nintent is clear: The \u201crights-creating language so \ncritical to the Court\u2019s analysis\u201d in its cases \u201cis \ncompletely absent\u201d here. Sandoval, 532 U.S. at 288 \n(cleaned up). And that ends the analysis. Ibid. \n\n33 \n \nD. The Medicaid Act\u2019s broader statutory \nregime reinforces that the any-qualified-\nprovider provision does not create \nprivate rights. \nThe Medicaid Act\u2019s broader statutory scheme \nconfirms what the any-qualified-provider provision\u2019s \ntext has already shown\u2014that the provision does not \ncreate privately enforceable rights. \nThe Medicaid Act is not a civil-rights statute that \nimposes duties and restraints on states. It is merely a \nfunding mechanism, and state \u201cparticipation in the \nMedicaid program is entirely optional.\u201d Harris v. \nMcRae, 448 U.S. 297, 301 (1980). States that choose \nto participate in Medicaid may also choose to change \ntheir programs, even if doing so creates the possibility \nthat the Secretary will deny funding. 42 U.S.C. 1396c; \n42 C.F.R. 430.12(c). \nThe Act\u2019s baseline requirement for states is \nproviding coverage to \u201ccategorically needy\u201d groups for \nsome basic services. Barbara S. Klees et al., Ctrs. for \nMedicare & Medicaid Servs., Brief Summaries of \nMedicare & Medicaid: Title XVIII & Title XIX of The \nSocial Securities Act 22\u201326 (Dec. 31, 2012). Beyond \nthat, states can choose how they want to structure \ntheir programs when it comes to eligibility standards, \nscope of coverage, payment methodology, and the like. \nId. at 22\u201328. The Secretary alone decides if a state \nhas satisfied the Act\u2019s requirements and, if the state \nlater falls out of compliance in administering its plan, \nwhether to withhold some or all of the state\u2019s funding. \n42 U.S.C. 1396c; 42 C.F.R. 430.12(c). \n \n\n34 \n \nPut differently, the Act imposes a legally binding \ndirective only on the Secretary, who is charged with \napproving plans and ensuring states substantially \ncomply with the Act\u2019s plan requirements to continue \nreceiving funds. 42 U.S.C. 1396c. Absent a Talevski-\nlike bill of rights, \u201c[f]ocusing on substantial compli-\nance is tantamount to focusing on the aggregate \npractices of a state funding recipient.\u201d Midwest Foster \nCare & Adoption Ass\u2019n v. Kincade, 712 F.3d 1190, \n1201 (8th Cir. 2013). \nLike the FERPA provisions in Gonzaga, then, \nSection 1396a and the any-qualified-provider provi-\nsion are \u201cprimarily directed [at] the Federal Govern-\nment\u2019s \u2018distribution of public funds,\u2019 [with] \u2018an \naggregate, not individual, focus.\u2019\u201d Talevski, 599 U.S. \nat 185\u201386 (quoting Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at 290). The \nSecretary must look at the aggregate of more than 80 \ndisparate plan requirements and assess a state\u2019s sub-\nstantial compliance. \u201cEven where a subsidiary provi-\nsion includes mandatory language that ultimately \nbenefits individuals, a statute phrased as a directive \nto a federal agency typically does not confer enforce-\nable federal rights on the individuals.\u201d Gillespie, 867 \nF.3d at 1041 (citing Coutu, 450 U.S. at 756 n.1). \nJust as the Medicaid Act charges the Secretary of \nHealth and Human Services with dealing with state \nviolations, Congress in FERPA explicitly authorized \nthe Secretary of Education to \u201cdeal with violations\u201d of \nthat Act. Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at 289 (quoting 20 U.S.C. \n1232g(f)). And there was \u201cno question that FERPA\u2019s \nnondisclosure provisions fail[ed] to confer enforceable \nrights.\u201d Id. at 287. There is likewise no question that \nthe any-qualified-provider provision fails to confer an \nenforceable right here. \n\n35 \n \nThe plurality\u2019s analysis in Armstrong bolsters \nthat conclusion. 575 U.S. at 331\u201332 (Scalia, J., joined \nby Roberts, C.J., Thomas, J., and Alito, J.). Its opinion \nanalyzed 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(30)\u2014a subsection of the \nMedicaid Act parallel to the any-qualified-provider \nprovision\u2014and noted that it is \u201cphrased as a directive \nto the federal agency charged with approving state \nMedicaid plans, not as a conferral of the right to sue \nupon the beneficiaries of the State\u2019s decision to partic-\nipate in Medicaid.\u201d Id. at 331. \u201c[S]uch language re-\nveals no congressional intent to create a private right \nof action.\u201d Ibid. (cleaned up). The same is true here. \nIn this case, the Fourth Circuit placed great \nweight on 42 U.S.C. 1320a-2 in dismissing any \nrelevance of the any-qualified-provider provision\u2019s \nappearance in a statute \u201crequiring a State plan or \nspecifying the required contents of a State plan.\u201d \nPet.App.29a (quoting 42 U.S.C. 1320a-2). But as the \nEighth Circuit has explained, Section 1320a-2 simply \nmeans that a provision \u201ccannot be deemed indivi-\ndually unenforceable solely because of its situs in a \nlarger regime \u2018requiring a State plan or specifying the \nrequired contents of a state plan.\u2019\u201d Midwest Foster \nCare, 712 F.3d at 1200 (emphasis added). And \u201cwhen \na statute links funding to substantial compliance with \nits conditions\u2014including forming and adhering to a \nstate plan with specified features\u2014this [link] \ncounsels against the creation of individually enforce-\nable rights.\u201d Ibid. That\u2019s \u201cbecause, even where a state \nsubstantially complies with its federal responsibili-\nties, a sizeable minority of its beneficiaries may none-\ntheless fail to receive the full panoply of offered \nbenefits.\u201d Id. at 1200\u201301. True rights-creating provi-\nsions require more than this. \n\n36 \n \nTellingly, the Armstrong plurality did not think \nSection 1320a-2 foreclosed its consideration of this \ncritical statutory context. See Kauffman, 981 F.3d at \n376 (Elrod, J., concurring, joined by six other judges) \n(explaining that Section 1320a-2 \u201cdid not inform the \nanalysis\u201d in Armstrong). Neither should this Court.  \nStanding alone, the Medicaid Act\u2019s substantial \ncompliance regime, its directive to the Secretary, or \nits articulation of dozens of plan requirements might \nnot be enough to foreclose private enforceability. See \nArmstrong, 575 U.S. at 328 (making that point \nregarding the Secretary\u2019s ability to withhold funds). \nBut taken together, they confirm what the text \nestablishes\u2014that Congress chose not to confer a \nprivately enforceable right in the any-qualified-\nprovider provision. \nE. Common sense confirms what text and \nstructure prove. \n1. Respondents\u2019 approach would drop \nTalevski\u2019s high bar to the floor.  \nIn their opposition brief, Respondents argued that \nthe any-qualified-provider provision \u201chas an \u2018unmis-\ntakable focus\u2019 on the benefited class and is \u2018phrased in \nterms of the persons benefited,\u2019\u201d which, Respondents \nclaimed, \u201c\u2018satisfie[s]\u2019 this Court\u2019s test for whether a \nstatute contains the necessary rights-creating lan-\nguage.\u201d Opp.16 (quoting Talevski, 599 U.S. at 183). \nSuch a reading of Talevski would drop Gonzaga\u2019s \u201cde-\nmanding bar\u201d to the floor. Talevski, 599 U.S. at 180. \n \n\n37 \n \nA statute that \u201caddresses,\u201d Opp.16, a benefited \nclass still must contain clear rights-creating language \nto confer privately enforceable rights. Per Gonzaga, \n\u201crights-creating\u201d language is \u201ccritical to showing the \nrequisite congressional intent to create new rights.\u201d \n536 U.S. at 287 (emphasis added); accord Sandoval, \n532 U.S. at 288 (same). Focus on a benefited class is \nnecessary\u2014but not sufficient. \nConsider the implications of finding privately \nenforceable rights simply because a statute \u201cadd-\nresses whether \u2018individual\u2019 Medicaid patients \u2018may \nobtain\u2019\u201d a benefit. Opp.16. Leaving aside that Section \n1396a(a) uses the word \u201cindividual\u201d hundreds of \ntimes, eight of the 87 listed plan-requirement provi-\nsions contain individual-focused, benefit-conferring \nlanguage that likely would satisfy Respondents\u2019 lax \ntest. Those provisions say that a \u201cState plan for \nmedical assistance must\u201d do the following: \n(3)  \u201cprovide for granting an opportunity for a fair \nhearing before the State agency to any \nindividual \nwhose \nclaim \nfor \nmedical \nassistance under the plan is denied or is not \nacted upon with reasonable promptness,\u201d \n1396a(a)(3) (emphasis added); \n(8)  \u201cprovide that all individuals wishing to make \napplication for medical assistance under the \nplan shall have opportunity to do so, and that \nsuch assistance shall be furnished with \nreasonable \npromptness \nto \nall \neligible \nindividuals,\u201d 1396a(a)(8) (emphasis added); \n \n\n38 \n \n(10) \u201cprovide\u2014(B) that the medical assistance \nmade available to any individual described \nin subparagraph (A)\u2014(i) shall not be less in \namount, duration, or scope than the medical \nassistance made available to any other such \nindividual, and (ii) shall not be less in \namount, duration, or scope than the medical \nassistance made available to individuals not \ndescribed \nin \nsubparagraph \n(A),\u201d \n1396a(a)(10)(B) (emphasis added); \n       \u201cprovide\u2014(D) for the inclusion of home health \nservices for any individual who, under the \nState plan, is entitled to nursing facility \nservices,\u201d 1396a(a)(10)(D) (emphasis added); \n(12) \u201cprovide that, in determining whether an \nindividual is blind, there shall be an \nexamination by a physician skilled in the \ndiseases of the eye or by an optometrist, \nwhichever \nthe \nindividual \nmay \nselect,\u201d \n1396a(a)(12) (emphasis added); \n(32) \u201cprovide that no payment under the plan for \nany care or service provided to an individual \nshall be made to anyone other than such \nindividual or the person or institution \nproviding such care or service,\u201d barring \ncertain exceptions, 1396a(a)(32) (emphasis \nadded); \n(34) \u201cprovide that in the case of any individual \nwho has been determined to be eligible for \nmedical assistance under the plan, such \nassistance will be made available to him for \ncare and services included under the plan \nand furnished in or after the third month \n\n39 \n \nbefore the month in which he made \napplication (or application was made on his \nbehalf in the case of a deceased individual) \nfor such assistance if such individual was (or \nupon application would have been) eligible \nfor such assistance at the time such care and \nservices \nwere \nfurnished,\u201d \n1396a(a)(34) \n(emphasis added); \n(53) \u201cprovide\u2014(A) for notifying in a timely \nmanner all individuals in the State who are \ndetermined to be eligible for medical \nassistance and who are pregnant women, \nbreastfeeding or postpartum women \u2026, or \nchildren below the age of 5, of the availability \nof benefits furnished by the special supple-\nmental \nnutrition \nprogram \nunder \nsuch \nsection,\u201d 1396a(a)(53)(A) (emphasis added); \nand \n        \u201c(B) for referring any such individual to the \nState agency responsible for administering \nsuch program,\u201d 1396a(a)(53)(B) (emphasis \nadded); \n(84) \u201cprovide that\u2014(A) the State shall not \nterminate eligibility for medical assistance \nunder the State plan \u2026 for an individual who \nis an eligible juvenile \u2026 because the juvenile \nis an inmate of a public institution \u2026,\u201d \n1396a(a)(84)(A) (emphasis added); \n        \u201c(B) in the case of an individual who is an \neligible juvenile \u2026, the State shall, prior to \nthe individual\u2019s release from such a public \ninstitution, conduct a redetermination of \neligibility for such individual with respect to \n\n40 \n \nsuch medical assistance \u2026 and, if the State \ndetermines \u2026 that the individual continues \nto meet the eligibility requirements for such \nmedical assistance, the State shall restore \ncoverage for such medical assistance to such \nan individual upon the individual\u2019s release \nfrom such public institution,\u201d 1396a(a)(84)(B) \n(emphasis added).4 \nEach of these requirements \u201caddresses whether \n\u2018individual\u2019 Medicaid patients,\u201d Opp.16, \u201cshall\u201d or \n\u201cwill\u201d be given various types of medical assistance, \nproviders, or processes to ensure timely and equal \naccess to that assistance. Given Gonzaga\u2019s \u201cdemand-\ning bar,\u201d Talevski, 599 U.S. at 180, it can\u2019t be true that \nall of them create privately enforceable rights. If it \nwere, then Talevski was hardly the \u201catypical case,\u201d id. \nat 183, and lower courts are free to \u201cfind\u201d private \nrights in innumerable federal statutory provisions. \nWorse, accepting Respondents\u2019 position that a \nprovision\u2019s \u201c\u2018unmistakable focus\u2019 on the benefited \nclass\u201d and its \u201c\u2018phras[ing] in terms of the persons \nbenefited\u2019\u201d is enough to create a private right, Opp.16 \n(cleaned up), would require overruling Suter v. Artist \nM., in its entirety. 503 U.S. 347 (1992). That is exactly \nwhat Congress insisted it was not doing when it \npassed Section 1320a-2. 42 U.S.C. 1320a-2 (providing \n\u201cthat this section is not intended to alter the holding \nin Suter v. Artist M. that section 671(a)(15) of this \ntitle is not enforceable in a private right of action\u201d). \n \n4 Accord 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(84)(C), (D) (requiring similar pro-\ncessing of applications for medical assistance submitted by \u201can \nindividual who is an eligible juvenile\u201d described in separate \nsubsections). \n\n41 \n \nThe Adoption Act plan-requirement provision in \nSuter required states to specify that, \u201cin each case, \nreasonable efforts will be made (A) prior to the \nplacement of a child in foster care, to prevent or \neliminate the need for removal of the child from his \nhome, and (B) to make it possible for the child to \nreturn to his home.\u201d Suter, 503 U.S. at 351 (quoting \n42 U.S.C. 671(a)(15)) (emphasis added). And yet, the \nCourt held that provision did not \u201cconfer[ ] an enforce-\nable private right on its beneficiaries\u201d even though it \nconferred a benefit and identified the benefited \nindividuals (\u201ca child\u201d and \u201cthe child\u201d in foster care). \nId. at 364. A \u201creasonable efforts\u201d requirement\u2014like a \nstate\u2019s substantial-compliance requirement to allow \nMedicaid recipients to choose a qualified provider\u2014\n\u201cis at least as plausibly read to impose only a rather \ngeneralized duty on the State, to be enforced not by \nprivate individuals, but by the Secretary.\u201d Id. at 363. \nIn recent decades, this Court has reined in the \n\u201cready implication\u201d of privately enforceable rights. \nArmstrong, 575 U.S. at 330 n.*. It should not return \nto \u201cthe heady days in which [it] assumed common-law \npowers to create causes of action.\u201d Corr. Servs. Corp. \nv. Malesko, 534 U.S. 61, 75 (2001) (Scalia J., \nconcurring). Accepting that invitation would subject \nstates to countless suits under a myriad of federal \nstatutes\u2014all without congressional approval. \n2. Finding a private right in the any-\nqualified-provider provision creates \ncontradictions and problems.  \nAdditional practical reasons weigh strongly \nagainst finding a private right in the any-qualified-\nprovider provision. \n\n42 \n \nFirst, Respondents\u2019 position steals the discretion \nthat Congress vested in the Secretary through the \nsubstantial-compliance statute. Under the Medicaid \nAct, the Secretary is charged with interpretation and \nenforcement, including deciding whether a state\u2019s \nadministration of its plan is substantially compliant \nin its treatment of \u201cqualified\u201d providers. Yet under \nRespondents\u2019 theory, that administrative discretion is \nreassigned to federal district courts across the \ncountry issuing injunctions in Section 1983 actions.  \nSecond, a provider has a remedy for exclusion. It \ncan file an administrative appeal followed by state-\ncourt review and, if necessary, review by this Court. \n42 U.S.C. 1396a(kk)(8)(B)(ii); 42 C.F.R. 1002.213; S.C. \nCode Regs. 126\u2013150, 126\u2013152, 126\u2013154; S.C. Code \nAnn. \u00a7 1-23-380. Providers may balk at having to \npursue an administrative remedy. But no one is \ncontending that state-court review followed by a \npetition for certiorari is an inadequate backstop. \nWhat\u2019s more, to suggest that Congress also \nintended beneficiaries to have a simultaneous right to \nsue in federal court to challenge such a decision is, to \nsay the least, \u201ca curious system for review of a State\u2019s \ndetermination that a Medicaid provider is not \n\u2018qualified.\u2019\u201d Gillespie, 867 F.3d at 1041\u201342. And \nbecause there\u2019s no reason that a judicial affirmance of \na disqualification decision would have preclusive ef-\nfect on a beneficiary\u2019s federal claim, this \u201cgives \u2026 \nfurther reason to doubt that Congress \u2026 unambigu-\nously created an enforceable federal right\u201d here. Ibid. \nRelatedly, it makes sense to infer a private right \nin the FNHRA context, where the resident and his \nnursing home may have adverse interests. See \n\n43 \n \nTalevski, 599 U.S. at 172\u201374. It makes far less sense \nhere, where the beneficiary is protected by the \nprovider\u2019s exercise of its appeal rights. That may \nexplain why FNHRA has a savings clause, 42 U.S.C. \n1396r(h)(8), while Section 1396a does not. \nThird, a ruling for Respondents would clash with \nthe Medicaid Act\u2019s requirement that a state plan \n\u201cprovide \u2026 an opportunity for a fair hearing before \nthe State agency to any individual whose claim for \nmedical assistance under the plan is denied.\u201d 42 \nU.S.C. 1396a(a)(3). It would be strange for Congress \nto create an express administrative remedy for bene-\nficiaries to challenge their own eligibility while \nauthorizing those beneficiaries sub silentio to go to \nfederal court to challenge a provider\u2019s eligibility.  \nFourth, Respondents say that Medicaid benefi-\nciaries need a private right of action to preserve broad \naccess to healthcare. But nothing is further from the \ntruth. South Carolinians in the Medicaid program \nhave access to plenty of providers. See supra, pp. 9\u2013\n11. And any excluded providers have an administra-\ntive remedy and judicial review to preserve their par-\nticipation in the program.  \nFinally, accepting Respondents\u2019 position would \nsubject states to innumerable lawsuits and accom-\npanying attorney-fee awards\u2014all without the clear \nnotice that the Spending Clause requires. And that \nproblem is not limited to the any-qualified-provider \nprovision. Lower courts that fail to follow this Court\u2019s \nguidance have found a vast array of private rights \nenforceable under Section 1983. \n \n\n44 \n \nLimiting the survey just to 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a), \nthese lawsuits have included healthcare providers \nchallenging a state\u2019s notice-and-comment process for \nsetting payment rates, e.g., BT Bourbonnais Care, \nLLC v. Norwood, 866 F.3d 815, 824 (7th Cir. 2017) \n(applying 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(13)(A)); individuals \ncontesting how promptly they received medical \nassistance, e.g., Doe v. Kidd, 501 F.3d 348, 355\u201357 \n(4th Cir. 2007) (applying 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(8)); and \nbeneficiaries challenging eligibility decisions, e.g., \nBontrager v. Ind. Fam. & Soc. Servs. Admin., 697 \nF.3d 604, 606\u201307 (7th Cir. 2012) (applying 42 U.S.C. \n1396a(a)(10)). The cost of these federal lawsuits is not \neasily quantified. But there is no doubt that such \nlawsuits will drain state Medicaid coffers at the \nexpense of needy families and children\u2014harming the \nvery people the Medicaid Act is supposed to help. \nIn sum, the any-qualified-provider provision lacks \nthe kind of unambiguous rights-creating language \nthat this Court demands to recognize a private right \nenforceable by Section 1983. The Medicaid Act\u2019s \nstructure counsels strongly against recognizing a \nprivate right. And the practical ramifications of \nfinding a private right in Section 1396a(a)(23) are so \ndisconcerting and irrational that the Court should not \nimpute them to Congress. \n \n \n\n45 \n \nII. The Court need not overrule any cases, but \nit should clarify that it has abandoned Bless-\ning\u2019s factors and cabined Wilder and Wright. \nThe Court in Gonzaga and Talevski emphasized \nthe clear-rights-creating-language requirement to \nensure that lower courts do not loosely imply private \nrights enforceable through Section 1983. Yet despite \nthis Court\u2019s best efforts, lower courts have been slow \nto implement these instructions. As the decision \nbelow proves, \u201ceven after\u201d Talevski, some lower courts \nstill feel they \u201clack the guidance inferior judges need.\u201d \nPet.App.35a\u201336a (Richardson, J., concurring in the \njudgment). So the Court should provide it now. \nBlessing, Wilder, and Wright continue to sow \nconfusion, as Judge Richardson\u2019s concurrences prove. \nPet.App.35a\u201336a, 65a, 120a\u201325a. In Wilder, the \nCourt looked \u201cbeyond the unambiguous terms of the \nstatute\u201d \nand \nrelied \non \n\u201cpolicy \nconsiderations \npurportedly derived from legislative history and \nsuperseded versions of the statute\u201d to find a privately \nenforceable right. 496 U.S. at 528 (Rehnquist, C.J., \ndissenting). Blessing reached a different result, but it \nis remembered more for its distillation of \u201cthree \nfactors,\u201d 520 U.S. at 340, from Wilder and Wright. \nCourts and litigants alike have unfortunately read all \nthree cases as \u201cestablish[ing] a relatively loose \nstandard for finding rights enforceable by \u00a7 1983.\u201d \nGonzaga, 536 U.S. at 282.  \nAttempting to set the record straight, Gonzaga \ndisavowed any reading of Blessing, Wilder, and \nWright that might \u201csuggest that something less than \nan unambiguously conferred right is enforceable by \n\u00a7 1983.\u201d Ibid. And in assessing whether FERPA\u2019s \n\n46 \n \nprovisions created privately enforceable rights, the \nCourt did not apply the Blessing factors. Id. at 287\u2013\n90. In fact, when Justice Stevens argued in dissent \nthat separation of powers would be better served by \nthe Blessing test, id. at 300\u201302 (Stevens, J., dissent-\ning), the majority countered that it \u201cfail[ed] to see how \nrelations between the branches are served by having \ncourts apply a multifactor balancing test to pick and \nchoose which federal requirements may be enforced \nby \u00a7 1983 and which may not,\u201d id. at 286. \nTurning to Wilder and Wright, the Gonzaga Court \nnoted that in both cases, Congress had \u201cexplicitly \nconferred specific monetary entitlements upon the \nplaintiffs.\u201d Id. at 280. In contrast, the student \nplaintiff \u2019s attempt to find a federally enforceable right \nin FERPA was \u201ca far cry from the sort of individu-\nalized, concrete monetary entitlement found enforce-\nable\u201d in Wilder and Wright. Id. at 288 n.6. Years later, \nthe Armstrong majority took specific aim at Wilder, \nobserving that \u201clater opinions\u201d like Gonzaga \u201cplainly \nrepudiate the ready implication of a \u00a7 1983 action \nthat Wilder exemplified.\u201d 575 U.S. at 330 n.*. \nMore recently, this Court\u2019s decision in Talevski \nreaffirmed Gonzaga\u2019s analysis. All nine Justices \njoined opinions confirming that Gonzaga establishes \nthe \u201ctest for determining whether a particular federal \nlaw actually secures rights for \u00a7 1983 purposes.\u201d \nTalevski, 599 U.S. at 175; id. at 183 (\u201cGonzaga sets \nforth our established method for ascertaining \nunambiguous conferral.\u201d); id. at 193 (Barrett, J., \nconcurring) \n(\u201cGonzaga \nsets \nthe \nstandard \nfor \ndetermining when a Spending Clause statute confers \nindividual rights\u201d); id. at 230 (Alito, J., dissenting) \n(Gonzaga sets forth the Court\u2019s \u201cestablished method\u201d) \n\n47 \n \n(cleaned up). And all nine Justices agreed Gonzaga\u2019s \nunambiguous-conferral test sets a \u201chigh\u201d and \n\u201cdemanding bar.\u201d Id. at 180; id. at 184 (\u201csignificant \nhurdle\u201d); id. at 193 (Barrett, J., concurring) (\u201cThis bar \nis high\u201d); id. at 230 (Alito, J., dissenting) (agreeing \n\u201cwith the Court\u2019s understanding of the high bar\u201d). \nDespite that unanimity, the Court left some \nthings unsaid. And the Fourth Circuit used that \nsilence to double down on its prior opinions after \nTalevski. Pet.App.12a\u201313a. \nFirst, while Talevski did not apply the Blessing \nfactors, it did not overrule Blessing or expressly \ndisavow its test.5 So on remand, the Fourth Circuit \nreasoned that while Talevski had \u201cshed some new \nlight on Blessing,\u201d it was not for the court \u201cto proclaim \na Supreme Court precedent [had been] overthrown.\u201d \nPet.App.21a\u201322a. The court expected at least \u201csome \ndiscussion of Blessing had it been jettisoned,\u201d so it felt \nthat it \u201cremain[ed] bound by Blessing until given \nexplicit instructions to the contrary\u2014instructions \nthat have yet to come.\u201d Ibid. \nSecond, although Talevski did not cite Wright or \nWilder, it didn\u2019t overrule them either. So the Fourth \nCircuit\u2019s most recent decision continued to rely on \nWilder. In the court\u2019s view, Wilder had \u201calready held \nthat a different funding condition\u201d in Section 1396a(a) \n\u201cconfers individual rights enforceable via\u201d Section \n \n5 But see The Supreme Court 2022 Term, 42 U.S.C. 1983 \u2013 \nSpending Clause \u2013 Health & Hospital Corp. of Marion County v. \nTalevski, 137 Harv. L. Rev. 380, 388 (2023) (observing that the \nTalevski \u201cmajority affirmed the Seventh Circuit while silently \nabandoning the very test the Seventh Circuit believed \ngoverned,\u201d namely Blessing\u2019s three-factored test). \n\n48 \n \n1983. Pet.App.27a. So the Fourth Circuit thought that \nWilder \u201cappear[ed] to doom the State\u2019s argument\u201d \nthat the any-qualified-provider provision is not \nprivately enforceable because it focuses on govern-\nment officials overseeing funding. Ibid. And the court \ndid not believe that the Armstrong majority had effec-\ntively overruled Wilder, insisting instead that \u201c[t]he \nserious business of spurning a precedent cannot be \nprecipitated by winks and nods.\u201d Pet.App.28a. \nAgainst this backdrop, the Court should make \nclear that it has abandoned the Blessing test that \nsome lower courts still feel bound to apply \u201ceven after\u201d \nTalevski. Pet.App.35a. See, e.g., Saint Anthony Hosp. \nv. Whitehorn, 100 F.4th 767, 779 (7th Cir. 2024) \n(noting that Talevski did not \u201cdisapprove of Blessing\u201d \nand claiming not to \u201csee a fundamental difference \nbetween the Talevski/Gonzaga standard \u2026 and the \nfirst and third Blessing factors\u201d), reh\u2019g granted and \nopinion vacated, No. 21-2325, 2024 WL 3561942 (7th \nCir. July 24, 2024); Fed. L. Enf \u2019t Officers Ass\u2019n v. Att\u2019y \nGen. N.J., 93 F.4th 122, 130 (3d Cir. 2024) (observing \nthat this Court \u201chas not expressly held that the \nBlessing factors are no longer relevant\u201d and applying \nthose factors in a footnote). \nThe Court did something similar in Kennedy v. \nBremerton School District, 597 U.S. 507 (2022). \nThere, the Court clarified \u201cthat the shortcomings \nassociated with [the] ambitious, abstract, and \nahistorical approach to the Establishment Clause\u201d \nadopted in Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U.S. 602 (1971), \nhad become \u201cso apparent\u201d that the Court had \u201clong \nago abandoned Lemon and its endorsement test \noffshoot.\u201d Id. at 534 (cleaned up). \n\n49 \n \nBefore Kennedy, \u201c[t]he Court [had] explained that \nthese tests [had] invited chaos in lower courts, led to \ndiffering results in materially identical cases, and \ncreated a minefield for legislators.\u201d Ibid. (cleaned up). \nAnd more recently, the Court had rejected Lemon-\nbased arguments while, \u201c[i]n place of Lemon and the \nendorsement test,\u201d instructing \u201cthat the Establish-\nment Clause must be interpreted by reference to \nhistorical practices and understandings.\u201d Id. at 535\u2013\n36 (cleaned up). That focus had \u201clong represented the \nrule rather than some exception within the Court\u2019s \nEstablishment Clause jurisprudence.\u201d Id. at 536 \n(cleaned up). And the lower courts had \u201cerred by \nfailing to heed this guidance.\u201d Ibid. \nSo too here. This Court has not applied Blessing\u2019s \nthree factors since Blessing itself. 520 U.S. at 340\u201341. \nAnd even in Blessing, the Court merely said that they \nwere the \u201cthree factors\u201d the Court had \u201ctraditionally \nlooked at \u2026 when determining whether a particular \nstatutory provision gives rise to a federal right.\u201d Id. at \n340. That framing is more descriptive than pre-\nscriptive. And it is no longer an accurate description \nof what this Court considers in this context. \nWhat\u2019s more, in acknowledging the \u201cconfusion\u201d \nand \u201cuncertainty\u201d Blessing has wrought, this Court \nhas rejected Blessing-based arguments, confirming \nthat its cases do not \u201cpermit anything short of an \nunambiguously conferred right to support a cause of \naction brought under \u00a7 1983.\u201d Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at \n282\u201383. Given all this, the Court should clarify, much \nlike it did in Kennedy, that it has \u201clong ago abandoned \n[Blessing] and its [three-factor] test.\u201d Kennedy, 597 \nU.S. at 534. \n\n50 \n \nThe Court also should clarify that Wilder and \nWright are limited to the unique monetary-entitle-\nment-conferring provisions at issue there. Despite \nthis Court saying that its \u201copinions plainly repudiate \nthe ready implication of a \u00a7 1983 action that Wilder \nexemplified,\u201d Armstrong, 575 U.S. at 330 n.*, that was \nnot enough for the court below, Pet.App.27a\u201328a. And \nwhile Gonzaga cabined Wilder and Wright to cases \ninvolving spending provisions that \u201cexplicitly confer[ ] \nspecific monetary entitlements upon the plaintiffs,\u201d \nGonzaga, 536 U.S. at 280, 288 n.6, the court below \nrelied on Wilder anyway, Pet.App.15a\u201316a, 27a.  \nAgain, this Court has done something similar in \nthe Establishment Clause context. Three Terms ago, \nthe Court explained that Locke v. Davey, 540 U.S. 712 \n(2004), \u201ccannot be read beyond its narrow focus on \nvocational religious degrees.\u201d Carson ex rel. O. C. v. \nMakin, 596 U.S. 767, 789 (2022). The Court should \nsimilarly clarify here that Wilder and Wright \u201ccannot \nbe read beyond [their] narrow focus,\u201d ibid., on \u201cthe \nsort of individualized, concrete monetary entitlement \nfound enforceable\u201d in those cases, Gonzaga, 536 U.S. \nat 288 n.6. \nFinally, while the Court need not overrule \nBlessing, Wilder, or Wright to reverse the decision \nbelow, if the Court concludes more is required to guide \nlower courts, the Court should overrule all three. \n\u201cStare decisis is not an inexorable command, and the \nstare decisis considerations most relevant here\u2014the \nquality of the precedent\u2019s reasoning, the workability \nof the rule it established, and reliance on the \ndecision\u2014all weigh in favor of letting [all three \ndecisions] go.\u201d Loper Bright Enters. v. Raimondo, 603 \nU.S. 369, 407 (2024) (cleaned up). \n\n51 \n \n1. On the quality of the reasoning, Talevski \ncommands courts to \u201cemploy traditional tools of statu-\ntory construction to assess whether Congress has \nunambiguously conferred individual rights upon a \nclass of beneficiaries to which the plaintiff belongs.\u201d \n599 U.S. at 183 (cleaned up). But in Blessing, Wilder, \nand Wright, the Court did not use traditional tools of \nstatutory interpretation, nor did it ask whether \nCongress had unambiguously conferred a right. The \nCourt asked mainly whether Congress had imposed a \nmandatory benefit. See Blessing, 520 U.S. at 341 \n(asking whether Congress imposed \u201ca binding \nobligation\u201d); Wilder, 496 U.S. at 509\u201310 (looking only \nfor mandatory benefits); Wright, 479 U.S. at 430\u201331 \n(same). That never should have been enough. See \nWilder, 496 U.S. at 528 (Rehnquist, C.J., dissenting); \nWright, 479 U.S. at 434 (O\u2019Connor, J., dissenting). \n2. This trio of cases has also proven unworkable. \nAs shown by the decision below and the 5\u20132 circuit \nsplit, Wilder and Wright, along with Blessing\u2019s three-\nfactored test, have sown chaos and confusion in the \nlower courts. This Court tried to \u201cresolve [that] \nambiguity\u201d in Gonzaga. 536 U.S. at 278. But it didn\u2019t \nwork. \u201cVirtually all the circuits refused to read \nGonzaga as repudiating Blessing.\u201d The Supreme \nCourt 2022 Term, 137 Harv. L. Rev. at 388 (collecting \ncases). \u201cMany interpreted Gonzaga as merely glossing \nBlessing\u2019s first prong and began applying this \n\u2018Blessing-Gonzaga test\u2019 as controlling law.\u201d Ibid. \n(cleaned up) (collecting cases). Others \u201cread Gonzaga \nas providing merely \u2018principles\u2019 courts should keep \n\u2018firmly in mind\u2019 as they apply the \u2018Blessing test.\u2019\u201d Ibid. \n(quoting N.Y. State Citizens\u2019 Coal. for Child. v. Poole, \n922 F.3d 69, 79 (2d Cir. 2019)). \n\n52 \n \n3. This confusion means \u201carguments for reliance \n\u2026 are misplaced.\u201d S. Dakota v. Wayfair, 585 U.S. 162, \n186 (2018). \u201cThis is especially so because\u201d Congress, \nthe states, and private parties \u201chave been on notice \nfor years regarding this Court\u2019s misgivings\u201d about all \nthree cases. Janus v. Am. Fed\u2019n of State, Cnty., and \nMun. Emps., Council 31, 585 U.S. 878, 927 (2018). \nAlso, Congress repealed the amendment in Wilder \n\u201cand replaced it with narrower language\u201d to give the \nstates more flexibility. Long Term Care Pharmacy All. \nv. Ferguson, 362 F.3d 50, 58 (1st Cir. 2004).  \nIn short, given how badly their \u201cdoctrinal under-\npinnings have \u2026 eroded,\u201d how \u201cunworkable\u201d they\u2019ve \nproved, Kimble v. Marvel Ent., LLC, 576 U.S. 446, \n458\u201359 (2015), and how little reliance exists, the \nCourt would be justified in overruling all three cases. \nIII. Reversal would respect separation of pow-\ners and enable states to better steward \nscarce Medicaid resources. \n\u201cUnder the Constitution\u2019s separation of powers, \nCongress and the President may update the law to \nmeet modern policy priorities and needs.\u201d Arizona v. \nNavajo Nation, 599 U.S. 555, 566 (2023). \u201cBut it is not \nthe Judiciary\u2019s role to update the law.\u201d Ibid. And it is \n\u201cparticularly important that the federal courts not do \nso\u201d in cases involving the allocation of scarce resour-\nces that leave states in a \u201czero-sum situation.\u201d Ibid. \nIn Navajo Nation, that resource was \u201cwater in the \narid regions of the American West.\u201d Ibid. Here, it\u2019s \nMedicaid dollars. \u201cAnd the zero-sum reality\u201d of both \n\u201cunderscores that courts must stay in their proper \nconstitutional lane and interpret the law \u2026 according \n\n53 \n \nto its text and history, leaving to Congress and the \nPresident\u201d the task of updating the law in light of \n\u201ccompeting contemporary needs.\u201d Id. at 567. \nThe Medicaid program is expensive for states. \n\u201cOn average, states spend 29% of their annual \nbudgets on costs related to Medicaid.\u201d Br. of Amici \nCuriae U.S. Senators and Representatives at 12, July \n5, 2024. \u201cThat makes Medicaid the costliest expendi-\nture for many state budgets.\u201d Ibid. (emphasis added). \n(Medicaid is a 24.3% share of South Carolina\u2019s state \nbudget. South Carolina At-a-Glance, State Health \nAccess Data Assistance Center, perma.cc/X3VL-\n25WT).  \nWhen federal courts discover private rights \nburied in state plan requirements, those costs \nincrease exponentially. \u201cAuthorizing lawsuits by \npatients to challenge their providers\u2019 terminations \nburdens state agencies with redundant and intrusive \noversight while the high cost of federal litigation \ndisplaces more efficient uses of state resources.\u201d \nPlanned Parenthood of Greater Tex. Fam. Plan. & \nPreventive Health Servs. v. Smith, 913 F.3d 551, 571 \n(5th \nCir. \n2019) \n(Jones, \nJ., \nconcurring). \nAnd \nRespondents\u2019 position creates the \u201cthreat of a federal \nlawsuit\u2014and its attendant costs and fees\u2014whenever \n[a state makes] changes\u201d to its list of qualified \nproviders. Gee v. Planned Parenthood of Gulf Coast, \nInc., 586 U.S. 1057, 1058 (2018) (Thomas, J., \ndissenting from the denial of cert.). Even just the \nthreat of litigation can impose real costs on real \npeople as the \u201clooming potential for complex litigation \ninevitably will dissuade state officials from making \ndecisions that they believe to be in the public \ninterest.\u201d Ibid. \n\n54 \n \nThe scope of such litigation is staggering. In a \n2020 report, the U.S. Department of Health and \nHuman Services\u2019 Office of Inspector General reported \nmore than 9,000 terminated Medicaid providers in its \ndatabase. Department of Health & Human Services \nOffice of the Inspector General, States Could Do More \nTo Prevent Terminated Providers From Serving \nMedicaid \nBeneficiaries \nat \n7 \n(Mar. \n2020), \nperma.cc/9JLQ-J696. Under Respondents\u2019 theory, \nbeneficiaries in each state have a right to file a \nSection 1983 lawsuit that seeks the reinstatement of \nevery one of those providers\u2014plus damages and \nattorney fees. \nThe problem is exponentially worse when consid-\nering more than just qualified-provider litigation. \nGiven the broader questions this case implicates, the \nCourt\u2019s decision could impact the costs imposed on \nstates across a host of federal spending programs. In \nthe adoption-and-foster-care context, for example, \nJudge Livingston has raised the alarm that\u2014under \nthe kinds of arguments that Respondents raise here\u2014\nstate foster-care programs face an \u201cunfortunate and \nunsupportable risk of increased litigation\u201d under the \nAdoption \nAssistance \nand \nChild \nWelfare \nAct, \n\u201cinconsistent results\u201d in those cases, \u201cand disorderly \nadministration, none of which will inure to those \nprograms\u2019 benefit.\u201d Poole, 922 F.3d at 95 (Livingston, \nJ., dissenting) (cleaned up). That \u201craises the prospect \nthat scarce foster care resources, instead of going to \nfoster children, will be squandered in litigation \ndestined to produce arbitrary and inconsistent \nresults.\u201d Id. at 97. If those costs are to be imposed on \nstates, that choice is best left to the people\u2019s elected \nrepresentatives in Congress. \n\n55 \n \n* * * \nNothing in the any-qualified-provider provision\u2019s \ntext or structure unambiguously expresses congres-\nsional intent to confer a federal private right on \nanyone. To hold otherwise would encroach upon the \nexecutive and legislative branches\u2019 prerogatives while \nincreasing the cost to the states of providing medical \ncare to their neediest citizens. And doing so would \ndrop Gonzaga\u2019s supposedly \u201cdemanding bar,\u201d 599 \nU.S. at 180, to the floor. Because the text and \nstructure of the any-qualified-provider provision do \nnot present the \u201catypical case,\u201d id. at 183, that provi-\nsion does not create private rights enforceable under \nSection 1983.  \nCONCLUSION \nThe judgment of the courts of appeals should be \nreversed. \n        Respectfully submitted, \nFEBRUARY 2025 \n \nKELLY M.

This observation has refined that uncertainty into a structured set of inquiries.

My task-level knowledge has evolved from a blank slate to a clear research plan. To form a prediction, I must now gather information on:\n1.  **Petitioner's Arguments (South Carolina):** The specific textual and structural arguments for why the statute does not create a private right of action.\n2.  **Respondent's Arguments (Planned Parenthood):** The counterarguments for why such a right exists, likely based on the statute's text, structure, and purpose.\n3.  **Key Precedents:** The specific case law each side will use to support their interpretation of private rights of action.\n4.  **Procedural History:** The reasoning of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, which found in favor of the beneficiaries, as this is the decision under review.\n5.  **Executive Branch Position:** The views of the Solicitor General, if an amicus brief is filed, as this can be highly influential on the Court.",

This involves:\n1.  **Clarifying the Core Legal Question:** Isolate the precise statutory provision and the legal doctrine at issue (here, implied private rights of action under Spending Clause legislation).\n2.  **Structuring Uncertainty:** Explicitly separate task-level unknowns (\u03b8: case-specific facts and arguments) from design-level unknowns (D: general judicial principles and interpretive methods). This creates a clear research agenda.\n3.  **Prioritizing Primary Sources:** A key insight is that the most valuable first information-gathering step is to analyze the **petitioner's brief on the merits**.

My belief state is now populated with the core of their case, which will serve as the foundation against which I will evaluate the respondent's counterarguments.\n\nMy knowledge has been updated as follows:\n1.  **Petitioner's Core Argument:** South Carolina's central claim is that the Medicaid Act\u2019s \u201cany-qualified-provider\u201d provision (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a(a)(23)(A)) does not \"unambiguously confer\" a private right of action. They argue that for Spending Clause legislation, the Court's precedents, particularly *Gonzaga University v. Doe* and the recent *Health & Hospital Corp. v. Talevski*, set a \"demanding bar\" that requires \"explicit rights-creating terms.\"\n2.  **Textual & Structural Analysis:** The petitioner's case rests heavily on a textual and structural comparison to the statute in *Talevski*.\n    *   **Text:** They emphasize that \u00a7 1396a(a)(23)(A) states a plan \"must provide that\" an individual \"may obtain\" care. It critically lacks the word \"right.\"\n    *   **Structure:** They contrast this with the Federal Nursing Home Reform Act (FNHRA) at issue in *Talevski*. The FNHRA provisions were explicitly labeled as \"rights\" (e.g., a \"right to be free from\" restraints, a section on \"Transfer and discharge rights,\" and a \"right to choose a personal attending physician\"). The Medicaid provision, by contrast, is one of 87 items in a section simply labeled \"Contents\" of a state plan.\n3.  **Precedent Strategy:** The petitioner is actively trying to shape the legal landscape by asking the Court to cabin or marginalize older, more lenient precedents. They argue the Court should clarify that the three-factor test from *Blessing v. Freestone* has been abandoned and that cases like *Wilder v. Virginia Hospital Association* and *Wright v. City of Roanoke* have been superseded by the stricter *Gonzaga*/*Talevsksi* framework.\n4.  **Alternative Remedies:** South Carolina argues that the statute provides a different remedy for non-compliance: the Secretary of HHS can withhold federal funds (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396c). They also point to the state-level administrative appeal process available to providers as the intended remedial scheme, not individual lawsuits in federal court.\n5.  **Updated Research Plan:** My inquiry is now much more focused. The primary unknown is how Planned Parenthood and its allies will counter this specific line of attack. I must now seek out the respondent's brief to understand:\n    *   How they argue the phrase \"may obtain such assistance from any qualified provider\" is, in fact, \"unambiguous rights-creating language\" despite the absence of the word \"right.\"\n    *   How they distinguish the structural placement of this provision from the petitioner's characterization.\n    *   How they will defend the continued relevance of *Wilder* and *Wright* and argue that *Talevski* does not foreclose their claim.",
          "design_beliefs": "My meta-level understanding of effective legal prediction strategies has been significantly validated and refined. This observation confirms the power of a structured, source-driven approach.\n\nMy design beliefs have evolved in the following ways:\n1.  **Validation of the \"Petitioner-First\" Heuristic:** This observation provides powerful evidence for the effectiveness of prioritizing the petitioner's brief on the merits. This single document transformed my task-level beliefs from a set of abstract questions into a concrete \"strategic blueprint\" of one side's entire case. This confirms that in future Supreme Court cases, obtaining and analyzing the petitioner's brief is the highest-value initial information-gathering action after understanding the basic facts and legal question.\n2.  **New Heuristic: \"The *Talevski* Litmus Test\":** I have learned that for any contemporary case concerning private rights of action under Spending Clause legislation, the analysis must begin with *Health & Hospital Corp. v. Talevski*. A new and highly effective heuristic is to immediately compare the statutory text and structure in question with the FNHRA provisions analyzed in *Talevski*. The presence or absence of explicit \"rights\" language and placement within a \"bill of rights\" section appears to be the central battleground. This litmus test will be a primary analytical tool for all future cases in this domain.\n3.  **New Heuristic: \"Precedent Bracketing\":** I have observed a sophisticated legal strategy in action. The petitioner is not just citing favorable precedent; they are actively working to \"bracket\" or \"cabin\" unfavorable precedents (*Blessing*, *Wilder*) by arguing they have been implicitly overruled or limited by a more recent line of cases (*Gonzaga*, *Talevski*). This strategy of re-contextualizing the legal landscape is a key indicator of how a party intends to argue its case and is a pattern I must look for in future briefs. It is a more advanced form of analysis than simply tallying which cases support which side.\n4.  **Refined Source Prioritization:** The initial \"decompose the problem\" strategy led to the \"petitioner-first\" heuristic. This observation reinforces that primary legal documents (briefs, statutes) are exponentially more valuable than secondary summaries. They reveal not only the arguments but the strategic choices, the precise framing, and the intended narrative, which are all critical for prediction."

After \nreconsidering its prior holding in light of Talevski, the \ncourt of appeals again affirmed, with all three judges \nagreeing that the Medicaid Act\u2019s free-choice-of-\nprovider provision is privately enforceable under \nSection 1983.  Id. at 1a-35a; id. at 36a (Richardson, J., \nconcurring in the judgment).   \n\n3 \n \n \n \n1. Medicaid is the national health insurance \nprogram for persons of limited financial means.  Pet. \nApp. 5a.  It provides federal funding for medical care \nfor children, needy families, the elderly, the blind, the \ndisabled, and pregnant women.  See 42 U.S.C. \n1396d(a).   \nMedicaid is a joint federal-state effort.  Pet. App. \n5a.  A state must comply with various federal \nrequirements to participate, see Armstrong v. \nExceptional Child Ctr., Inc., 575 U.S. 320, 323 (2015), \nincluding the free-choice-of-provider requirement.  To \ncomply with that requirement, a state\u2019s Medicaid plan \n\u201cmust\u201d provide that \u201cany individual eligible for \nmedical assistance  *  *  *  may obtain such assistance\u201d \nfrom any provider who is \u201cqualified to perform the \nservice or services required\u201d and \u201cwho undertakes to \nprovide \nhim \nsuch \nservices.\u201d \n \n42 \nU.S.C. \n1396a(a)(23)(A).   \n2. PPSAT and its predecessors have provided \nhealth care to low-income residents of South Carolina \nfor four decades.  Pet. App. 7a, 58a.  PPSAT operates \ntwo health centers in the state, one in Charleston and \none in Columbia.  Id. at 6a.  Both are in medically \nunderserved communities.  See Resp. C.A. Br. 4, No. \n21-1043 (4th Cir. May 28, 2021) (21-1043 Resp. C.A. \nBr.).  Those centers serve hundreds of Medicaid \npatients each year.  Pet. App. 7a, 87a. \nPPSAT\u2019s health centers provide essential medical \ncare through Medicaid.  They offer a range of services, \nincluding \nphysical \nexams; \ncancer \nscreenings; \ncontraception; pregnancy testing and counseling; and \nscreening for conditions such as diabetes, depression, \nanemia, cholesterol, thyroid disorders, and high blood \npressure.  Pet. App. 6a, 69a; 21-1043 Resp. C.A. Br. 4.  \nThe health centers provide abortion services, but \nMedicaid does not pay for abortion except in the very \n\n4 \n \n \n \nlimited circumstances required by federal law.  Pet. \nApp. 6a-7a. \nPatients insured through Medicaid choose PPSAT \nfor many reasons.  PPSAT provides non-judgmental, \nhigh-quality medical care.  See Pet. App. 6a-7a.  It also \nhas designed its services to help low-income patients \novercome barriers to accessing care.  Id. at 7a.  For \nexample, PPSAT offers extended hours and flexible \nscheduling; same-day appointments and short wait \ntimes; comprehensive contraceptive care in a single \nappointment; and interpreter services for patients \nwho do not speak English.  Ibid.  PPSAT continued to \noffer high-quality medical care during the COVID-19 \npandemic, including through telemedicine.  21-1043 \nResp. C.A. Br. 5.  That ensured continuity of care for \nlow-income patients and lessened the burdens on \nother parts of the health care system.  Pet. App. 7a-8a \n& n.2.   \nRespondent Julie Edwards is a Medicaid patient \nwho has received care at PPSAT.  Pet. App. 7a.  She \nsuffers from diabetes.  Id. at 44a.  Because doctors \nhave advised her that complications from diabetes \nwould make it dangerous for her to carry a pregnancy \nto term, she sought access to safe and effective birth \ncontrol.  Ibid.  After having difficulty finding a doctor \nwho would treat her, she obtained care at PPSAT.  Id. \nat 7a, 44a.  PPSAT doctors provided her with birth \ncontrol and also informed her that her blood pressure \nwas elevated, so she could obtain follow-up care for \nthat issue.  Ibid.  Ms. Edwards was impressed with \nPPSAT and intends to obtain future gynecological and \nreproductive health care there.  Ibid.   \n3. In July 2018, South Carolina\u2019s Department of \nHealth and Human Services (SCDHHS) terminated \nPPSAT\u2019s participation in the state Medicaid program.  \nPet. App. 8a, 70a.  The termination was prompted by \n\n5 \n \n \n \nthe Governor, who issued two executive orders \ndesigned to withdraw state funding from any \norganization that provides abortions, purportedly \nbased on a twenty-five-year-old statute.  Id. at 8a, 88a; \nsee S.C. Code Ann. \u00a7 43-5-1185. \nRelying on those orders, SCDHHS terminated \nPPSAT\u2019s state Medicaid agreement.  Pet. App. 8a.  \nSCDHHS did not find that PPSAT is unqualified to \nprovide care.  Id. at 87a.  Instead, it terminated \nPPSAT\u2019s participation in Medicaid \u201csolely because \n[PPSAT] performed abortions outside of the Medicaid \nprogram.\u201d  Ibid.  As a result of the termination, \nPPSAT\u2019s health centers immediately had to begin \nturning away Medicaid patients.  Id. at 88a. \n4. Respondents sued under 42 U.S.C. 1983.  Pet. \nApp. 8a.  They alleged, inter alia, that the termination \nviolates the Medicaid Act\u2019s free-choice-of-provider \nprovision.  Ibid.  They sought preliminary injunctive \nrelief, so that Ms. Edwards and other patients could \ncontinue to receive care from their chosen providers.  \nIbid. \nThe \ndistrict \ncourt \nentered \na \npreliminary \ninjunction.  Pet. App. 126a-146a.  As a threshold \nmatter, it held that the Medicaid Act\u2019s free-choice-of-\nprovider requirement is privately enforceable under \nSection 1983 because the statute \u201cunambiguously \nconfers a right\u201d on Medicaid patients to \u201cobtain \nassistance from any qualified and willing provider.\u201d  \nId. at 134a.  Then, on the merits, the court concluded \nthat petitioner likely violated the Medicaid Act by \nterminating PPSAT\u2019s Medicaid participation without \ncause.  Id. at 138a-141a.  The court found it \n\u201cundisputed\u201d that PPSAT is \u201cqualified\u201d to provide \nmedical care, as the statute requires.  Id. at 138a-139a \n(citing 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(23)(A)).   \n\n6 \n \n \n \nThe court of appeals affirmed the preliminary \ninjunction.  Pet. App. 80a-125a.  Like the district \ncourt, the court of appeals concluded that a Medicaid \npatient may sue under Section 1983 to enforce the \nfree-choice-of-provider requirement.  Id. at 94a-98a.  \nApplying this Court\u2019s decisions in Blessing v. \nFreestone, 520 U.S. 329 (1997), and Gonzaga \nUniversity v. Doe, 536 U.S. 273 (2002), the court of \nappeals recognized that a federal statute creates a \nright enforceable under Section 1983 \u201conly when the \nunderlying statute itself unambiguously \u2018confers an \nindividual right\u2019 on the plaintiff.\u201d  Pet. App. 94a \n(quoting Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at 284-285).   \nHere, the court of appeals explained, the statute is \n\u201cunmistakably \nclear\u201d \nin \ncreating \na \nprivately \nenforceable right.  Pet. App. 103a-104a.  \u201cIf th[is] \nlanguage does not suffice to confer a private right, \nenforceable under \u00a7 1983,\u201d the court stated, \u201cit is \ndifficult to see what language would be adequate.\u201d  Id. \nat 102a.  All three judges agreed on this point.  See \nibid.; id. at 120a-125a (Richardson, J., concurring) \n(agreeing that the statute \u201cunambiguously create[s] a \nright privately enforceable under \u00a7 1983\u201d).    \nOn the merits, the court of appeals concluded that \nPPSAT and Ms. Edwards established a likelihood of \nsuccess on the merits because under the free-choice-\nof-provider provision, a state may not exclude a \nqualified and willing provider.  Pet. App. 138a-141a.  \nThe court noted that petitioner did not dispute that \n\u201cPPSAT is professionally qualified to deliver the \nservices that [Ms. Edwards] seeks.\u201d  Id. at 107a; see \nid. at 98a n.3 (\u201cPPSAT\u2019s qualifications are simply not \nin dispute\u201d in this case.).  The court rejected \npetitioner\u2019s argument that it can terminate the \nMedicaid contract of any provider it wishes even when \n\n7 \n \n \n \nit \u201cadmits\u201d that the provider is \u201cperfectly competent.\u201d  \nId. at 109a-110a.   \nPetitioner filed a petition for a writ of certiorari, \nwhich this Court denied.  Baker v. Planned \nParenthood S. Atl., 141 S. Ct. 550 (2020) (No. 19-\n1186). \n5. The district court granted summary judgment \nto PPSAT and Ms. Edwards and entered a permanent \ninjunction.  Pet App. 68a-79a.  The court again held \nthat \nthe \nMedicaid \nAct\u2019s \nfree-choice-of-provider \nprovision is privately enforceable under Section 1983 \nand determined that petitioner violated the Medicaid \nAct by terminating PPSAT\u2019s participation in the state \nMedicaid program.  Id. at 74a.  The court noted that \npetitioner did not dispute that PPSAT is a \u201cmedically \nand professionally qualified provider\u201d and determined \nthat petitioner accordingly had no valid basis for the \ntermination.  Ibid. \nThe court of appeals affirmed.  Pet. App. 38a-64a.  \nThe court again held that Medicaid\u2019s free-choice-of-\nprovider provision confers a right enforceable under \nSection 1983.  Id. at 54a-64a.  The court carefully \nreviewed this Court\u2019s precedents and recognized that \n\u201cnothing \u2018short of an unambiguously conferred right\u2019  \n*  *  *  may support a cause of action.\u201d  Id. at 55a \n(quoting Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at 283).  The statute here, \nthe \ncourt \nexplained, \n\u201cunmistakably \nevinces \nCongress\u2019s \nintention \nto \nconfer \non \nMedicaid \nbeneficiaries a right to the free choice of their \nprovider\u201d because it confers an individual right in \nmandatory terms; courts are competent to determine \nif a provider is qualified; and the Medicaid Act does \nnot provide a comprehensive enforcement scheme that \nshows \nCongress\u2019s \nintent \nto \nforeclose \nprivate \nenforcement.  Id. at 57a-62a.  Again, all three judges \nagreed that the statute unambiguously confers a \n\n8 \n \n \n \nprivate right enforceable under Section 1983.  Id. at \n51a-64a; id. at 65a (Richardson, J., concurring in the \njudgment).  \nThe court of appeals noted that petitioner no \nlonger contested the merits.  Pet. App. 51a.  \nSpecifically, petitioner \u201cd[id] not\u201d renew his merits \narguments \nto \n\u201cchallenge \nthe \ndistrict \ncourt\u2019s \ndetermination (and [the court of appeals\u2019] own \nprevious conclusion) that South Carolina violated\u201d the \nfree-choice-of-provider provision \u201cby terminating \nPlanned Parenthood\u2019s Medicaid provider agreement.\u201d  \nId. at 51a n.1.  \n6. This Court then granted the petition for a writ \nof certiorari in Talevski.  That petition presented two \nquestions:  (1) whether a federal statute that Congress \nenacted using its Spending Clause power can give rise \nto a right enforceable under Section 1983, and \n(2) whether two provisions in the Federal Nursing \nHome \nReform \nAct \n(FNHRA), \n42 \nU.S.C. \n1396r(c)(1)(A)(ii) and 1396r(c)(2)(A), are privately \nenforceable under Section 1983.  See Pet. at *i-ii, \nHealth & Hosp. Corp. of Marion Cnty. v. Talevski, No. \n21-806, 2021 WL 5702312 (Nov. 23, 2021).  The Court \nanswered both questions in the affirmative.  Talevski, \n599 U.S. at 175-191.  In concluding that the provisions \nat issue are privately enforceable under Section 1983, \nthe Court applied its \u201cestablished method for \nascertaining unambiguous conferral\u201d of an individual \nright.  Id. at 183; see id. at 175-191.  \nIn the meantime, petitioner filed a petition for a \nwrit of certiorari in this case.  The Court granted the \npetition, vacated the judgment of the court of appeals, \nand remanded the case for further consideration in \nlight of Talevski.  Kerr v. Planned Parenthood S. Atl., \n143 S. Ct. 2633 (2023) (No. 21-1431). \n\n9 \n \n \n \n7. The court of appeals affirmed.  Pet. App. 1a-\n36a.  \u201c[W]ith the benefit of Talevski\u2019s guidance,\u201d the \ncourt again held that the free-choice-of-provider \nprovision \nconfers \na \nright \nenforceable \nunder \nSection 1983.  Id. at 12a-13a. \nThe court of appeals explained that the free-choice-\nof-provider provision is enforceable under Section \n1983 \nbecause \nit \n\u201cexplicitly \ngives \nMedicaid \nbeneficiaries the right to the provider of their choice\u201d \nand \u201cthere is no indication that Congress wanted to \nforeclose such individuals from seeking relief under \n\u00a7 1983.\u201d  Pet. App. 14a.  On the first point, the court \nreviewed this Court\u2019s precedents and recognized that \n\u201c\u200a\u2018Gonzaga sets forth [the] established method for \nascertaining unambiguous conferral\u2019 of individual \nrights.\u201d  Id. at 19a (quoting Talevski, 599 U.S. at 183).  \nThat test is satisfied, the court continued, \u201cwhere the \nprovision in question is \u2018phrased in terms of the \npersons benefited\u2019 and contains \u2018rights-creating,\u2019 \nindividual-centric language with an \u2018unmistakable \nfocus on the benefited class.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Ibid. (quoting Talevski, \n599 U.S. at 183 (in turn quoting Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at \n284, 287)).   \nHere, the court of appeals explained, the free-\nchoice-of-provider provision unambiguously confers \nrights on individual Medicaid recipients:  \u201cLike the \ntext at issue in Talevski,\u201d the free-choice-of-provider \nprovision \u201cspeak[s] \u2018in terms of the person benefited,\u2019 \nand ha[s] an \u2018unmistakable focus on the benefited \nclass.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Pet. App. 25a (quoting Talevski, 599 U.S. at \n186).  The free-choice-of-provider provision, the court \nexplained, \u201cfocus[es] on discrete beneficiaries and \nguarantee[s] them a choice\u201d of any qualified medical \nprovider \u201cfree from state interference.\u201d  Ibid.  The \ncourt noted that Talevski \u201cbolstered [its] previous \nconclusion\u201d by providing examples of rights-creating \n\n10 \n \n \n \nlanguage \u201csimilar to the language\u201d in the free-choice-\nof-provider provision.  Ibid.   \nPetitioner had argued that the court of appeals \nshould reverse its prior holdings because its decisions \ncited Blessing and Wilder v. Virginia Hospital Ass\u2019n, \n496 U.S. 498 (1990), and in petitioner\u2019s view, those \ndecisions no longer are good law after Talevski.  Pet. \nApp. 14a.

South Carolina terminated the \nMedicaid \nprovider \nagreement \nof \na \nPlanned \nParenthood affiliate without cause.  The affiliate and \none of its patients sued under 42 U.S.C. 1983.  The \npatient invoked the Medicaid Act\u2019s free-choice-of-\nprovider provision, which states that \u201cany individual \neligible for medical assistance\u201d \u201cmay obtain such \nassistance from any institution\u201d that is \u201cqualified to \nperform the service or services required\u201d and \n\u201cundertakes to provide [the individual] such services.\u201d  \n42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(23)(A).   \nThree times, the court of appeals has held that the \nfree-choice-of-provider \nprovision \nunambiguously \nconfers a right that is privately enforceable under \nSection 1983.  In its most recent decision, the court of \nappeals so held after faithfully applying this Court\u2019s \nrecent decision in Health & Hospital Corp. of Marion \nCounty v.

KERR, DIRECTOR, SOUTH CAROLINA  \nDEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, \nPETITIONER\nv. \nPLANNED PARENTHOOD SOUTH ATLANTIC, ET AL. \nOn Petition for a Writ of Certiorari to the  \nUnited States Court of Appeals  \nfor the Fourth Circuit \nBRIEF IN OPPOSITION\nOPINIONS BELOW \nThe opinion of the court of appeals (Pet. App. 1a-\n36a) is reported at 95 F.4th 152.  The opinion of the \ndistrict court (Pet. App. 68a-79a) is reported at 487 F. \nSupp. 3d 443.   \nPrior relevant opinions of the court of appeals (Pet. \nApp. 38a-65a, 80a-125a) are reported at 27 F.4th 945 \nand 941 F.3d 687.  A prior relevant order of the district \ncourt (Pet. App. 126a-146a) is reported at 326 F. Supp. \n3d 39.  \nJURISDICTION \nThe judgment of the court of appeals was entered \non March 5, 2024.  The petition for a writ of certiorari \nwas filed on June 3, 2024.  The jurisdiction of this \nCourt is invoked under 28 U.S.C. 1254(1).  \n\n2 \n \n \n \nSTATEMENT \nPlanned Parenthood South Atlantic (PPSAT) \nprovides essential medical services, including birth \ncontrol, cancer screenings, and physical exams, to low-\nincome South Carolina residents through the state\u2019s \nMedicaid program.  South Carolina terminated \nPPSAT\u2019s participation in that program, even though \nit \u201cagree[s]\u201d that PPSAT \u201cis perfectly competent to \nprovide  *  *  *  healthcare.\u201d  Pet. App. 41a.  PPSAT \nand one of its patients, who relies on PPSAT for care \nthat is critical for preserving her health, sued under \n42 U.S.C. 1983.  They contended that the termination \nviolates the Medicaid Act\u2019s free-choice-of-provider \nprovision, 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(23)(A), which gives \nMedicaid recipients the right to choose to receive their \nmedical care from any qualified and willing provider.  \nPet. App. 6a, 8a.   \nThe district court preliminarily enjoined the \ndirector of the state health department (petitioner) \nfrom terminating PPSAT\u2019s participation in the \nMedicaid program, Pet. App. 126a-146a; the court of \nappeals affirmed, id. at 80a-119a; and this Court \ndenied certiorari, see id. at 47a. \nThe \ndistrict \ncourt \nthen \ngranted \nsummary \njudgment to PPSAT and the patient, id. at 66a-79a; \nthe court of appeals affirmed, id. at 64a; and this \nCourt granted the petition, vacated, and remanded in \nlight of Health & Hospital Corp. of Marion County v. \nTalevski, 599 U.S. 166 (2023), Pet. App. 37a.  After \nreconsidering its prior holding in light of Talevski, the \ncourt of appeals again affirmed, with all three judges \nagreeing that the Medicaid Act\u2019s free-choice-of-\nprovider provision is privately enforceable under \nSection 1983.  Id. at 1a-35a; id. at 36a (Richardson, J., \nconcurring in the judgment).   \n\n3 \n \n \n \n1. Medicaid is the national health insurance \nprogram for persons of limited financial means.  Pet. \nApp. 5a.  It provides federal funding for medical care \nfor children, needy families, the elderly, the blind, the \ndisabled, and pregnant women.  See 42 U.S.C. \n1396d(a).   \nMedicaid is a joint federal-state effort.  Pet. App. \n5a.  A state must comply with various federal \nrequirements to participate, see Armstrong v. \nExceptional Child Ctr., Inc., 575 U.S. 320, 323 (2015), \nincluding the free-choice-of-provider requirement.  To \ncomply with that requirement, a state\u2019s Medicaid plan \n\u201cmust\u201d provide that \u201cany individual eligible for \nmedical assistance  *  *  *  may obtain such assistance\u201d \nfrom any provider who is \u201cqualified to perform the \nservice or services required\u201d and \u201cwho undertakes to \nprovide \nhim \nsuch \nservices.\u201d \n \n42 \nU.S.C. \n1396a(a)(23)(A).   \n2. PPSAT and its predecessors have provided \nhealth care to low-income residents of South Carolina \nfor four decades.  Pet. App. 7a, 58a.  PPSAT operates \ntwo health centers in the state, one in Charleston and \none in Columbia.  Id. at 6a.  Both are in medically \nunderserved communities.  See Resp. C.A. Br. 4, No. \n21-1043 (4th Cir. May 28, 2021) (21-1043 Resp. C.A. \nBr.).  Those centers serve hundreds of Medicaid \npatients each year.  Pet. App. 7a, 87a. \nPPSAT\u2019s health centers provide essential medical \ncare through Medicaid.  They offer a range of services, \nincluding \nphysical \nexams; \ncancer \nscreenings; \ncontraception; pregnancy testing and counseling; and \nscreening for conditions such as diabetes, depression, \nanemia, cholesterol, thyroid disorders, and high blood \npressure.  Pet. App. 6a, 69a; 21-1043 Resp. C.A. Br. 4.  \nThe health centers provide abortion services, but \nMedicaid does not pay for abortion except in the very \n\n4 \n \n \n \nlimited circumstances required by federal law.  Pet. \nApp. 6a-7a. \nPatients insured through Medicaid choose PPSAT \nfor many reasons.  PPSAT provides non-judgmental, \nhigh-quality medical care.  See Pet. App. 6a-7a.  It also \nhas designed its services to help low-income patients \novercome barriers to accessing care.  Id. at 7a.  For \nexample, PPSAT offers extended hours and flexible \nscheduling; same-day appointments and short wait \ntimes; comprehensive contraceptive care in a single \nappointment; and interpreter services for patients \nwho do not speak English.  Ibid.  PPSAT continued to \noffer high-quality medical care during the COVID-19 \npandemic, including through telemedicine.  21-1043 \nResp. C.A. Br. 5.  That ensured continuity of care for \nlow-income patients and lessened the burdens on \nother parts of the health care system.  Pet. App. 7a-8a \n& n.2.   \nRespondent Julie Edwards is a Medicaid patient \nwho has received care at PPSAT.  Pet. App. 7a.  She \nsuffers from diabetes.  Id. at 44a.  Because doctors \nhave advised her that complications from diabetes \nwould make it dangerous for her to carry a pregnancy \nto term, she sought access to safe and effective birth \ncontrol.  Ibid.  After having difficulty finding a doctor \nwho would treat her, she obtained care at PPSAT.  Id. \nat 7a, 44a.  PPSAT doctors provided her with birth \ncontrol and also informed her that her blood pressure \nwas elevated, so she could obtain follow-up care for \nthat issue.  Ibid.  Ms. Edwards was impressed with \nPPSAT and intends to obtain future gynecological and \nreproductive health care there.  Ibid.   \n3. In July 2018, South Carolina\u2019s Department of \nHealth and Human Services (SCDHHS) terminated \nPPSAT\u2019s participation in the state Medicaid program.  \nPet. App. 8a, 70a.  The termination was prompted by \n\n5 \n \n \n \nthe Governor, who issued two executive orders \ndesigned to withdraw state funding from any \norganization that provides abortions, purportedly \nbased on a twenty-five-year-old statute.  Id. at 8a, 88a; \nsee S.C. Code Ann. \u00a7 43-5-1185. \nRelying on those orders, SCDHHS terminated \nPPSAT\u2019s state Medicaid agreement.  Pet. App. 8a.  \nSCDHHS did not find that PPSAT is unqualified to \nprovide care.  Id. at 87a.  Instead, it terminated \nPPSAT\u2019s participation in Medicaid \u201csolely because \n[PPSAT] performed abortions outside of the Medicaid \nprogram.\u201d  Ibid.  As a result of the termination, \nPPSAT\u2019s health centers immediately had to begin \nturning away Medicaid patients.  Id. at 88a. \n4. Respondents sued under 42 U.S.C. 1983.  Pet. \nApp. 8a.  They alleged, inter alia, that the termination \nviolates the Medicaid Act\u2019s free-choice-of-provider \nprovision.  Ibid.  They sought preliminary injunctive \nrelief, so that Ms. Edwards and other patients could \ncontinue to receive care from their chosen providers.  \nIbid. \nThe \ndistrict \ncourt \nentered \na \npreliminary \ninjunction.  Pet. App. 126a-146a.  As a threshold \nmatter, it held that the Medicaid Act\u2019s free-choice-of-\nprovider requirement is privately enforceable under \nSection 1983 because the statute \u201cunambiguously \nconfers a right\u201d on Medicaid patients to \u201cobtain \nassistance from any qualified and willing provider.\u201d  \nId. at 134a.  Then, on the merits, the court concluded \nthat petitioner likely violated the Medicaid Act by \nterminating PPSAT\u2019s Medicaid participation without \ncause.  Id. at 138a-141a.  The court found it \n\u201cundisputed\u201d that PPSAT is \u201cqualified\u201d to provide \nmedical care, as the statute requires.  Id. at 138a-139a \n(citing 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(23)(A)).   \n\n6 \n \n \n \nThe court of appeals affirmed the preliminary \ninjunction.  Pet. App. 80a-125a.  Like the district \ncourt, the court of appeals concluded that a Medicaid \npatient may sue under Section 1983 to enforce the \nfree-choice-of-provider requirement.  Id. at 94a-98a.  \nApplying this Court\u2019s decisions in Blessing v. \nFreestone, 520 U.S. 329 (1997), and Gonzaga \nUniversity v. Doe, 536 U.S. 273 (2002), the court of \nappeals recognized that a federal statute creates a \nright enforceable under Section 1983 \u201conly when the \nunderlying statute itself unambiguously \u2018confers an \nindividual right\u2019 on the plaintiff.\u201d  Pet. App. 94a \n(quoting Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at 284-285).   \nHere, the court of appeals explained, the statute is \n\u201cunmistakably \nclear\u201d \nin \ncreating \na \nprivately \nenforceable right.  Pet. App. 103a-104a.  \u201cIf th[is] \nlanguage does not suffice to confer a private right, \nenforceable under \u00a7 1983,\u201d the court stated, \u201cit is \ndifficult to see what language would be adequate.\u201d  Id. \nat 102a.  All three judges agreed on this point.  See \nibid.; id. at 120a-125a (Richardson, J., concurring) \n(agreeing that the statute \u201cunambiguously create[s] a \nright privately enforceable under \u00a7 1983\u201d).    \nOn the merits, the court of appeals concluded that \nPPSAT and Ms. Edwards established a likelihood of \nsuccess on the merits because under the free-choice-\nof-provider provision, a state may not exclude a \nqualified and willing provider.  Pet. App. 138a-141a.  \nThe court noted that petitioner did not dispute that \n\u201cPPSAT is professionally qualified to deliver the \nservices that [Ms. Edwards] seeks.\u201d  Id. at 107a; see \nid. at 98a n.3 (\u201cPPSAT\u2019s qualifications are simply not \nin dispute\u201d in this case.).  The court rejected \npetitioner\u2019s argument that it can terminate the \nMedicaid contract of any provider it wishes even when \n\n7 \n \n \n \nit \u201cadmits\u201d that the provider is \u201cperfectly competent.\u201d  \nId. at 109a-110a.   \nPetitioner filed a petition for a writ of certiorari, \nwhich this Court denied.  Baker v. Planned \nParenthood S. Atl., 141 S. Ct. 550 (2020) (No. 19-\n1186). \n5. The district court granted summary judgment \nto PPSAT and Ms. Edwards and entered a permanent \ninjunction.  Pet App. 68a-79a.  The court again held \nthat \nthe \nMedicaid \nAct\u2019s \nfree-choice-of-provider \nprovision is privately enforceable under Section 1983 \nand determined that petitioner violated the Medicaid \nAct by terminating PPSAT\u2019s participation in the state \nMedicaid program.  Id. at 74a.  The court noted that \npetitioner did not dispute that PPSAT is a \u201cmedically \nand professionally qualified provider\u201d and determined \nthat petitioner accordingly had no valid basis for the \ntermination.  Ibid. \nThe court of appeals affirmed.  Pet. App. 38a-64a.  \nThe court again held that Medicaid\u2019s free-choice-of-\nprovider provision confers a right enforceable under \nSection 1983.  Id. at 54a-64a.  The court carefully \nreviewed this Court\u2019s precedents and recognized that \n\u201cnothing \u2018short of an unambiguously conferred right\u2019  \n*  *  *  may support a cause of action.\u201d  Id. at 55a \n(quoting Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at 283).  The statute here, \nthe \ncourt \nexplained, \n\u201cunmistakably \nevinces \nCongress\u2019s \nintention \nto \nconfer \non \nMedicaid \nbeneficiaries a right to the free choice of their \nprovider\u201d because it confers an individual right in \nmandatory terms; courts are competent to determine \nif a provider is qualified; and the Medicaid Act does \nnot provide a comprehensive enforcement scheme that \nshows \nCongress\u2019s \nintent \nto \nforeclose \nprivate \nenforcement.  Id. at 57a-62a.  Again, all three judges \nagreed that the statute unambiguously confers a \n\n8 \n \n \n \nprivate right enforceable under Section 1983.  Id. at \n51a-64a; id. at 65a (Richardson, J., concurring in the \njudgment).  \nThe court of appeals noted that petitioner no \nlonger contested the merits.  Pet. App. 51a.  \nSpecifically, petitioner \u201cd[id] not\u201d renew his merits \narguments \nto \n\u201cchallenge \nthe \ndistrict \ncourt\u2019s \ndetermination (and [the court of appeals\u2019] own \nprevious conclusion) that South Carolina violated\u201d the \nfree-choice-of-provider provision \u201cby terminating \nPlanned Parenthood\u2019s Medicaid provider agreement.\u201d  \nId. at 51a n.1.  \n6. This Court then granted the petition for a writ \nof certiorari in Talevski.  That petition presented two \nquestions:  (1) whether a federal statute that Congress \nenacted using its Spending Clause power can give rise \nto a right enforceable under Section 1983, and \n(2) whether two provisions in the Federal Nursing \nHome \nReform \nAct \n(FNHRA), \n42 \nU.S.C. \n1396r(c)(1)(A)(ii) and 1396r(c)(2)(A), are privately \nenforceable under Section 1983.  See Pet. at *i-ii, \nHealth & Hosp. Corp. of Marion Cnty. v. Talevski, No. \n21-806, 2021 WL 5702312 (Nov. 23, 2021).  The Court \nanswered both questions in the affirmative.  Talevski, \n599 U.S. at 175-191.  In concluding that the provisions \nat issue are privately enforceable under Section 1983, \nthe Court applied its \u201cestablished method for \nascertaining unambiguous conferral\u201d of an individual \nright.  Id. at 183; see id. at 175-191.  \nIn the meantime, petitioner filed a petition for a \nwrit of certiorari in this case.  The Court granted the \npetition, vacated the judgment of the court of appeals, \nand remanded the case for further consideration in \nlight of Talevski.  Kerr v. Planned Parenthood S. Atl., \n143 S. Ct. 2633 (2023) (No. 21-1431). \n\n9 \n \n \n \n7. The court of appeals affirmed.  Pet. App. 1a-\n36a.  \u201c[W]ith the benefit of Talevski\u2019s guidance,\u201d the \ncourt again held that the free-choice-of-provider \nprovision \nconfers \na \nright \nenforceable \nunder \nSection 1983.  Id. at 12a-13a. \nThe court of appeals explained that the free-choice-\nof-provider provision is enforceable under Section \n1983 \nbecause \nit \n\u201cexplicitly \ngives \nMedicaid \nbeneficiaries the right to the provider of their choice\u201d \nand \u201cthere is no indication that Congress wanted to \nforeclose such individuals from seeking relief under \n\u00a7 1983.\u201d  Pet. App. 14a.  On the first point, the court \nreviewed this Court\u2019s precedents and recognized that \n\u201c\u200a\u2018Gonzaga sets forth [the] established method for \nascertaining unambiguous conferral\u2019 of individual \nrights.\u201d  Id. at 19a (quoting Talevski, 599 U.S. at 183).  \nThat test is satisfied, the court continued, \u201cwhere the \nprovision in question is \u2018phrased in terms of the \npersons benefited\u2019 and contains \u2018rights-creating,\u2019 \nindividual-centric language with an \u2018unmistakable \nfocus on the benefited class.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Ibid. (quoting Talevski, \n599 U.S. at 183 (in turn quoting Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at \n284, 287)).   \nHere, the court of appeals explained, the free-\nchoice-of-provider provision unambiguously confers \nrights on individual Medicaid recipients:  \u201cLike the \ntext at issue in Talevski,\u201d the free-choice-of-provider \nprovision \u201cspeak[s] \u2018in terms of the person benefited,\u2019 \nand ha[s] an \u2018unmistakable focus on the benefited \nclass.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Pet. App. 25a (quoting Talevski, 599 U.S. at \n186).  The free-choice-of-provider provision, the court \nexplained, \u201cfocus[es] on discrete beneficiaries and \nguarantee[s] them a choice\u201d of any qualified medical \nprovider \u201cfree from state interference.\u201d  Ibid.  The \ncourt noted that Talevski \u201cbolstered [its] previous \nconclusion\u201d by providing examples of rights-creating \n\n10 \n \n \n \nlanguage \u201csimilar to the language\u201d in the free-choice-\nof-provider provision.  Ibid.   \nPetitioner had argued that the court of appeals \nshould reverse its prior holdings because its decisions \ncited Blessing and Wilder v. Virginia Hospital Ass\u2019n, \n496 U.S. 498 (1990), and in petitioner\u2019s view, those \ndecisions no longer are good law after Talevski.  Pet. \nApp. 14a.  The court of appeals noted that Talevski did \nnot overrule either decision.  Id. at 22a-23a, 28a.  But \neither way, the court explained, \u201cthe central analysis \nremains the same\u201d \u2013 Talevski made clear that courts \nshould \u201clook primarily to Gonzaga\u201d to determine \nwhether Congress unambiguously conferred an \nindividual right, and the court of appeals\u2019 prior \ndecisions \u201cturned upon\u201d that same analysis and \n\u201crelied heavily on Gonzaga.\u201d  Id. at 23a.   \nThe court of appeals then reiterated its conclusion \nthat \nthe \nMedicaid \nAct \ndoes \nnot \nprovide \na \ncomprehensive enforcement scheme that shows \nCongress\u2019s intent to foreclose private enforcement.  \nPet. App. 32a-33a.  The court noted that petitioner \nhad \u201cnot asked us to revisit this question [i]n this \nappeal.\u201d  Id. at 33a. \nFinally, the court of appeals noted that it is \nundisputed that PPSAT is a qualified and willing \nprovider and that petitioner\u2019s decision to terminate \nPPSAT from South Carolina\u2019s Medicaid program was \nunjustified.  Pet. App. 33a-34a.  The court emphasized \nthat petitioner \u201chas not contested\u201d \u2013 at any time \n\u201cduring the long path of this litigation\u201d \u2013 that PPSAT \n\u201cis professionally qualified to provide the care that the \nplaintiff seeks.\u201d  Id. at 33a.  \nJudge Richardson concurred in the judgment.  Pet. \nApp. 35a-36a (Richardson, J., concurring in the \njudgment).  He agreed that the statute here \u201ccreate[s] \n\n11 \n \n \n \nan individual right enforceable under 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1983,\u201d but suggested this Court provide additional \nguidance on the relevant legal standard.  Id. at 36a \n(Richardson, J., concurring in the judgment).     \nARGUMENT \nPetitioner asks this Court (Pet. 15-16) to grant \ncertiorari to address two questions:  (1) whether the \nMedicaid Act\u2019s free-choice-of-provider provision, 42 \nU.S.C. 1396a(a)(23)(A), is privately enforceable under \n42 U.S.C. 1983, and (2) if so, whether the free-choice-\nof-provider provision allows a state to terminate a \nMedicaid provider for any reason, even if the state \nacknowledges that the provider is professionally \nqualified.  This Court\u2019s review is not warranted on \neither question.   \nOn the first question, the court of appeals \nfaithfully applied this Court\u2019s precedents, including \nTalevski, and its conclusion is consistent with that of \nnearly every court that has considered the issue.  \nPetitioner contends (Pet. 31-32) that the courts of \nappeals need guidance on the appropriate test for \ndetermining whether a federal statute is privately \nenforceable under Section 1983.  But Talevski already \nprovided that guidance; the Court reaffirmed that \ncourts should use its \u201cestablished method\u201d (599 U.S. \nat 183) for deciding whether a provision is privately \nenforceable.  This Court has repeatedly denied \npetitions presenting this first question \u2013 including in \nthis case1 \u2013 and it should do the same here.   \n \n1 Baker v. Planned Parenthood S. Atl., 141 S. Ct. 550 (2020) (No. \n19-1186); Gee v. Planned Parenthood of Gulf Coast, Inc., 139 \nS. Ct. 408 (2018) (No. 17-1492); Andersen v. Planned Parenthood \nof Kan. & Mid-Mo., 139 S. Ct. 638 (2018) (No. 17-1340); Betlach \nv. Planned Parenthood Ariz., Inc., 571 U.S. 1198 (2014) (No. 13-\n \n\n12 \n \n \n \nThis case does not present the second question, \nbecause that question concerns whether a patient has \na right to choose an unqualified provider, and \npetitioner has conceded throughout this litigation \nthat PPSAT is a qualified provider.  Further, \npetitioner presented no argument on this issue to the \ndistrict court on summary judgment or to the court of \nappeals in two rounds of briefing on appeal from that \ndecision.  He accordingly has forfeited any argument \nbased on that question.  Even if the question were \npresented here, petitioner\u2019s argument is mistaken, \nand no circuit split exists.  Further review therefore is \nunwarranted.      \nI. \nTHE PRIVATE-RIGHT-OF-ACTION ISSUE \nDOES NOT WARRANT THIS COURT\u2019S \nREVIEW \nPetitioner contends (Pet. 17-32) that the Medicaid \nAct\u2019s \nfree-choice-of-provider \nprovision, \n42 \nU.S.C. 1396a(a)(23)(A), is not privately enforceable \nunder 42 U.S.C. 1983.  He is wrong, and the issue does \nnot warrant the Court\u2019s review.  \nA. The court of appeals\u2019 decision is correct. \n1. Section 1983 authorizes \u201cany citizen of the \nUnited States or other person within [its] jurisdiction\u201d \nto sue any person who, \u201cunder color of\u201d state law, \n\u201cdepriv[ed]\u201d him or her \u201cof any rights, privileges, or \nimmunities secured by\u201d federal law.  42 U.S.C. 1983.  \nA person deprived of a right created by a federal \nstatute by a state actor may sue under Section 1983.  \nSee Maine v. Thiboutot, 448 U.S. 1, 4 (1980). \n \n621); Secretary of Ind. Fam. & Soc. Servs. Admin. v. Planned \nParenthood of Ind., Inc., 569 U.S. 1004 (2013) (No. 12-1039). \n\n13 \n \n \n \nThe federal statute at issue here gives a Medicaid \npatient the right to obtain care from the qualified and \nwilling provider of his or her choice.  It states:  \nA State plan for medical assistance must  *  *  *  \nprovide that  *  *  *  any individual eligible for \nmedical assistance  *  *  *  may obtain such \nassistance from any institution  *  *  *  qualified \nto perform the service or services required  \n*  *  *  [that] undertakes to provide him such \nservices.  \n42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(23)(A).   \nCongress enacted this provision to ensure that \nMedicaid recipients, like other individuals, could \nmake deeply personal choices about where to obtain \nmedical care without states \u201crestricting beneficiaries \nto certain providers.\u201d  Pet. App. 6a; see, e.g., S. Rep. \nNo. 744, 90th Cong., 1st Sess. 183 (1967).  Congress \nthen reiterated the importance of this right in the \nfamily-planning context, providing that even when a \nstate uses a managed-care system, the state cannot \nlimit a patient\u2019s free choice of provider for family-\nplanning services.  See 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(23)(B) \n(cross-reference to 42 U.S.C. 1396d(a)(4)(C)). \n2. In a careful and thorough opinion, the court of \nappeals faithfully applied this Court\u2019s precedents and \ncorrectly concluded that the Medicaid Act\u2019s free-\nchoice-of-provider provision is privately enforceable \nunder Section 1983.  Pet. App. 5a-35a.  All three \njudges agreed that the statute at issue here is \u201cclear \nand \nunambiguous\u201d \nin \nconferring \na \nprivately \nenforceable right.  Id. at 29a; see id. at 36a \n(Richardson, J., concurring in the judgment).  This \nwas not a close call:  The court found it \u201chard to \nconceive of any text  *  *  *  that would permit\u201d a \nprivate right of action \u201c[i]f the language of this \n\n14 \n \n \n \nmedical provider provision does not suffice.\u201d  Id. at \n35a.   \nThe court of appeals began its analysis by carefully \nreviewing this Court\u2019s precedents, including the \nrecent decision in Talevski.  Pet. App. 15a-21a.  \nTalevski applied the Court\u2019s settled precedents to hold \nthat a nursing facility resident could sue under \nSection 1983 to enforce two particular provisions of \nFNHRA.  599 U.S. at 180-191.  In so holding, Talevski \nexplained that \u201c\u200a\u2018Gonzaga sets forth [the] established \nmethod for ascertaining unambiguous conferral\u2019 of \nindividual rights,\u201d and that this test is satisfied \n\u201cwhere the provision in question is \u2018phrased in terms \nof the persons benefited\u2019 and contains \u2018rights-\ncreating,\u2019 \nindividual-centric \nlanguage \nwith \nan \n\u2018unmistakable focus on the benefited class.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Pet. App. \n19a (quoting Talevski, 599 U.S. at 183 (in turn quoting \nGonzaga, 536 U.S. at 284, 287)).  As the court of \nappeals recognized, this Court\u2019s decisions set a \n\u201cdemanding bar\u201d for finding a privately enforceable \nright.  Id. at 22a (quoting Talevski, 599 U.S. at 180). \nApplying that guidance, the court of appeals \ncorrectly concluded that the free-choice-of-provider \nprovision is privately enforceable.  The court \n\u201crigorously examine[d]\u201d the statutory text and \nconcluded that it unambiguously gives Medicaid \npatients an individual right to obtain care from their \nprovider of choice.  Pet. App. 22a, 25a.  The statute \nspecifically defines the intended class of beneficiaries \n(\u201cany individual  *  *  *  eligible for medical assistance\u201d \nunder Medicaid) and gives them a particular right \n(the right to \u201cobtain [care] from any\u201d qualified \nprovider). \n \nId. \nat \n23a \n(quoting \n42 \nU.S.C. \n1396a(a)(23)(A); emphasis omitted).   \nThat language is \u201ca prime example of the kind of \n\u2018rights-creating\u2019 language required to confer a \n\n15 \n \n \n \npersonal right on a discrete class of persons.\u201d  Pet. \nApp. 25a-26a (discussing Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at 284 \nn.3).  It \u201cspeak[s] in terms of the persons benefited and \nha[s] an unmistakable focus on the benefited class.\u201d  \nId. at 25a (quoting Talevski, 599 U.S. at 186).  Indeed, \nthe court explained, Talevski \u201cbolstered\u201d the court\u2019s \nprior conclusion on this point \u201cby providing additional \nexamples of rights-creating language similar to the \nlanguage at issue here.\u201d  Ibid.  \nFurther, the court of appeals found no indication \nin the statutory text that Congress intended to \nforeclose a Section 1983 remedy.  Pet. App. 32a-33a.  \nThere is no \u201cincompatibility between enforcement \nunder \u00a7 1983 and the enforcement scheme that \nCongress has enacted.\u201d  Id. at 32a (quoting Talevski, \n599 U.S. at 187).  That is particularly true, the court \nexplained, because \u201cthere is no way for Medicaid \nbeneficiaries to challenge disqualifications of their \npreferred providers through the administrative \nscheme.\u201d  Ibid.2  Notably, petitioner did not contest \nthis point in the court of appeals.  The court previously \nhad held that \u201cthe Medicaid Act provides no \ncomprehensive enforcement scheme sufficient to \novercome the presumption that the free-choice-of-\nprovider provision is enforceable under \u00a7 1983,\u201d id. at \n32a (quoting id. at 102a), and \u201cSouth Carolina d[id] \n \n2 Petitioner asserts in passing (Pet. 9) that PPSAT was required \nto exhaust state administrative remedies.  But patients such as \nMs. Edwards \u2013 the people with the free-choice-of-provider right \n\u2013 cannot participate in this administrative review process.  And \neven if Ms. Edwards could use that process, both the district \ncourt and court of appeals found that doing so would be \u201cfutile.\u201d  \nPet. App. 101a n.4.  Besides, it is well-established that a person \nis not required to exhaust administrative remedies before filing \nsuit under Section 1983.  Patsy v. Board of Regents of State of \nFla., 457 U.S. 496, 516 (1982); see Pet. App. 101a n.4.   \n\n16 \n \n \n \nnot ask\u201d the court \u201cto revisit this question [i]n this \nappeal,\u201d id. at 33a.  \n3. Petitioner offers two main criticisms of the \ncourt of appeals\u2019 decision.  Pet. 30-32, 36-37.  Neither \nhas merit.  \nFirst, petitioner argues (Pet. 36-37) that the court \nof appeals erred in reading the free-choice-of-provider \nprovision to create an unambiguously conferred right.  \nHe contends (ibid.) that the free-choice-of-provider \nprovision lacks rights-creating language, comparing it \nto the provision in Gonzaga that \u201csp[oke] only in terms \nof institutional policy and practice, not individual[s].\u201d  \n536 U.S. at 288 (discussing 20 U.S.C. 1232g(b)(1)-(2)).  \nThat comparison is inapt.  Whereas the provision in \nGonzaga concerned only institutional \u201cpolic[ies] or \npractice[s],\u201d 20 U.S.C. 1232g(b)(1)-(2), the free-choice-\nof-provider provision addresses whether \u201cindividual\u201d \nMedicaid patients \u201cmay obtain\u201d \u201cmedical assistance\u201d \nfrom \ntheir \nchosen \nproviders, \n42 \nU.S.C. \n1396a(a)(23)(A). \nPetitioner also notes (Pet. 36-37) that the free-\nchoice-of-provider provision does not contain the word \n\u201cright.\u201d  Yet there is no basis for petitioner\u2019s \u201cmagic \nwords\u201d rule.  Pet. App. 26a (quoting Federal Aviation \nAdmin. v. Copper, 566 U.S. 284, 291 (2012)).  The free-\nchoice-of-provider provision has an \u201cunmistakable \nfocus\u201d on the benefited class and is \u201cphrased in terms \nof the persons benefited,\u201d which \u201csatisfie[s]\u201d this \nCourt\u2019s test for whether a statute contains the \nnecessary rights-creating language.  Talevski, 599 \nU.S. at 183. \nSecond, petitioner argues (Pet. 30-31, 35-36) that \nthe court of appeals erred by putting too much weight \non this Court\u2019s decisions in Blessing and Wilder.  That \nis mistaken.  The court of appeals recognized that \n\n17 \n \n \n \n\u201c\u200a\u2018Gonzaga sets forth [the] established method for \nascertaining unambiguous conferral\u2019 of individual \nrights.\u201d  Id. at 19a (quoting Talevski, 599 U.S. at 183).  \nThe court then correctly stated and applied that test, \nexplaining that, for a statutory provision to be \nprivately enforceable, it must unambiguously confer \nan individual right on a particular class of people, and \nit must not include a comprehensive enforcement \nscheme showing a congressional intent to preclude \nprivate enforcement.  Pet. App. 24a-31a, 32a.  \nFurther, the court correctly noted that this Court has \nnot overruled Blessing.  Id. at 22a-23a.  Indeed, as the \ncourt noted (id. at 31a), both Gonzaga and Talevski \ncited Blessing.  See Talevski, 599 U.S. at 189; \nGonzaga, 536 U.S. at 287-289.   \nFar from changing the standard for determining \nwhether a federal law secures rights for Section 1983 \npurposes, the Court in Talevski stated that it was \napplying its \u201cestablished method for ascertaining \nunambiguous conferral\u201d to the federal statute at issue \nin that case.  599 U.S. at 183; see id. at 184-186.  The \ncourt of appeals likewise recognized that, throughout \nthis Court\u2019s line of decisions, the \u201ccentral inquiry\u201d has \nremained the same \u2013 \u201cwhether Congress conferred a \nclear and unambiguous right upon a discrete class of \nbeneficiaries.\u201d  Pet. App. 21a.  The court of appeals \nexplained that this analysis \u201cremains the same\u201d \u201cwith \nor without Blessing,\u201d id. at 23a, and it did not even \ncite Blessing in evaluating whether the free-choice-of-\nprovider provision is enforceable under Section 1983, \nsee id. at 24a-33a.  Instead, as in its prior decisions, it \nfocused on Gonzaga.  Id. at 23a-26a.  Petitioner is \n\n18 \n \n \n \ntherefore wrong to criticize the court of appeals for its \nbrief citations to Blessing.3  \nPetitioner likewise is wrong to say (Pet. 31, 35) \nthat the court of appeals improperly relied on Wilder.  \nThe court cited Wilder only for a narrow proposition \u2013 \nthat a provision in the Medicaid Act can create a \nprivately enforceable right.  Pet. App. 27a, 32a.  That \nis just a statement of the holding in Wilder.  Id. at 27a \n(citing Wilder, 496 U.S. at 509-510 (holding that the \nBoren Amendment is privately enforceable under \nSection 1983)).  That holding has never been called \ninto question by this Court.  In fact, the Court \n\u201capprovingly cited Wilder on this point\u201d in City of \nRancho Palos Verdes v. Abrams, 544 U.S. 113, 122 \n(2005).  Pet. App. 62a.   \nThis Court has questioned other parts of Wilder, \nbut the court of appeals recognized that, stating that \nthis Court has \u201cnoted  * * *  that \u2018[its] later opinions \nplainly repudiate the ready implication of a \u00a7 1983 \naction that Wilder exemplified\u2019\u201d and \u201cexpressly \n\u2018reject[ed] the notion,\u2019 implicit in Wilder, \u2018that [its] \ncases permit anything short of an unambiguously \nconferred right.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Pet. App. 27a-28a (quoting \nArmstrong, 575 U.S. at 330 n.*).   \n \n3  Notably, earlier in this case, petitioner took a different \nposition from the one he takes now; he actually relied on Blessing \nas providing the relevant legal standard.  For example, in his \nappeal of the preliminary injunction, petitioner argued that a \nstatute can give rise to a right enforceable through Section 1983 \nif the factors identified by this Court in Blessing are satisfied.  \nSee, e.g., Pet. C.A. Prelim. Inj. Br. 22-23, No. 18-2133 (4th Cir. \nNov. 26, 2018) (arguing that a plaintiff must \u201cmeet all  * * *  of \nthe[] requirements\u201d from Blessing for \u201ca \u00a7 1983 claim [to] lie\u201d); \nPet. C.A. Prelim. Inj. Reply Br. 3-10, No. 18-2133 (4th Cir. Feb. \n4, 2019) (similar).  This is reason to doubt petitioner\u2019s claimed \nneed for clarification about Blessing.    \n\n19 \n \n \n \nIn any event, the court of appeals explained that \npetitioner\u2019s arguments failed even if he were correct \nthat all of Wilder had been abrogated, because \nTalevski also \u201crejected the argument that provisions \nthat speak to and place obligations on government \nofficials [like the Medicaid Act] cannot create \nindividual rights.\u201d  Id. at 28a; see ibid. (\u201c[E]ven if \n[Wilder were] abrogated  * * *  the State\u2019s argument \nremains unpersuasive.\u201d).  Again, with or without \nWilder, the analysis and outcome remain the same.  \nMore generally, petitioner overstates the supposed \nneed for clarification about the status of Blessing and \nWilder.  The Court had the opportunity to provide \nguidance in Talevski, and it did so, explaining that \nGonzaga provides the relevant test, and that this test \nreflects \nthe \nCourt\u2019s \n\u201cestablished \nmethod \nfor \nascertaining unambiguous conferral\u201d of an individual \nright.  599 U.S. at 183.  All three judges of the court of \nappeals understood that the \u201ccentral inquiry\u201d was \nwhether Congress unambiguously conferred an \nindividual right on Medicaid patients, and all three \njudges agreed that Congress did that here.  Pet. App. \n31a, 35a; see id. at 36a (Richardson, J., concurring in \nthe judgment).  Under those circumstances, there is \nno need for this Court\u2019s review, particularly because \nthis Court \u201creviews judgments, not statements in \nopinions.\u201d  Black v. Cutter Labs., 351 U.S. 292, 297 \n(1956); see Camreta v. Greene, 563 U.S. 692, 704 \n(2011) (This Court\u2019s \u201cresources are not well spent \nsuperintending each word a lower court utters en \nroute to a final judgment.\u201d). \nB. Any differences in the approaches of the courts \nof appeals do not warrant this Court\u2019s review. \n1. Nearly every court of appeals that has \nconsidered the issue has held that the Medicaid Act\u2019s \nfree-choice-of-provider \nprovision, \n42 \nU.S.C. \n\n20 \n \n \n \n1396a(a)(23)(A), \nis \nprivately \nenforceable \nunder \nSection 1983.4  And nearly every district court that \nhas considered the issue has agreed with that \nconclusion.5 \n \n4 See Planned Parenthood of Kan. & Mid-Mo. v.

Id. at 357-358. \nThe Fifth Circuit stated that it is \u201cnot clear\u201d that \nthe Fourth Circuit would disagree with its holding, \nbecause that holding was premised on Texas \ndisqualifying the providers based on specific factual \nfindings of a state administrative agency, whereas \nSouth Carolina did not claim any health or safety \nbasis for disqualifying PPSAT.  Kauffman, 981 F.3d at \n365.  Indeed, as the court of appeals here explained, \nSouth Carolina has never contested, \u201cduring the long \npath of this litigation, that Planned Parenthood is \nprofessionally qualified to provide the care that the \nplaintiff seeks.\u201d  Pet. App. 33a.  The Fifth Circuit \ndistinguished private-right-of-action holdings from \nthree other courts of appeals on similar grounds.  \nKauffman, 981 F.3d at 365, 367.   \nThe Eighth Circuit\u2019s decision in Does v. Gillespie, \n867 F.3d 1034 (8th Cir. 2017), is distinguishable for \nthe same reason.  In that case, the Arkansas \nDepartment of Human Services terminated the \nprovider\u2019s participation in the state\u2019s Medicaid \nprogram \u201cfor cause\u201d based on ostensible \u201cevidence [of\u200a] \nunethical\u201d action and \u201cwrongful conduct.\u201d  Id. at 1038.  \nLike the Fifth Circuit, the Eighth Circuit had no \nreason to address whether a patient may challenge \nthe termination of a provider\u2019s Medicaid contract \nwhen the provider\u2019s professional qualifications are \nundisputed. \nFurther, the Eighth Circuit\u2019s decision relied on an \nanalysis that has been foreclosed by Talevski.  That \ncourt did not use the test set out by this Court, which \nfocuses on whether the specific language at issue \nincludes the necessary \u201crights-creating language.\u201d  \n\n23 \n \n \n \nTalevski, 599 U.S. at 183 (quoting Gonzaga, 536 U.S. \nat 290).  Rather than analyze the specific text of 42 \nU.S.C. 1396a(a)(23)(A), the court treated the mere \npossibility of federal enforcement as precluding \nprivate enforcement, Gillespie, 867 F.3d at 1041, a \nview that Talevski expressly rejected, 599 U.S. at 186-\n192.   \nThe Eighth Circuit also focused on the fact that the \nprovision exists within a set of requirements for state \nMedicaid plans.  Gillespie, 867 F.3d at 1041.  But \nTalevski rejected that reasoning as well, explaining \n(in the context of a similar statute) that it is wrong to \nsay that provisions that impose obligations on third \nparties cannot create individual rights.  599 U.S. at \n185.  Further, as the court of appeals noted (Pet. App. \n29a), the Medicaid Act itself refutes that reasoning, \nbecause it expressly instructs that a provision of the \nAct \u201cis not to be deemed unenforceable because of its \ninclusion in a section of [the Act]  * * *  specifying the \nrequired contents of a State plan.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 1320a-2.   \nFinally, the Eighth Circuit\u2019s decision in Gillespie is \nout of step with its own precedent, because in other \nprivate-right-of-action cases, that court has faithfully \napplied Gonzaga.  See, e.g., Spectra Commc\u2019ns Grp. v. \nCity of Cameron, Mo., 806 F.3d 1113, 1120 (8th Cir. \n2015); Lankford v. Sherman, 451 F.3d 496, 508-509 \n(8th Cir. 2006).  The Eighth Circuit should have an \nopportunity to reconsider its analysis in Gillespie in \nlight of these decisions and in light of the guidance \nthis Court provided in Talevski. \n3. There is no urgent need for this Court\u2019s review.  \nContrary to petitioner\u2019s suggestion (Pet. 35-37), the \nquestion presented does not arise frequently.  Since \nthe first appellate decision permitting enforcement of \nthe free-choice-of-provider provision under Section \n1983 (the Sixth Circuit\u2019s decision in Harris in March \n\n24 \n \n \n \n2006), respondents are aware of only twelve district \ncourt decisions involving lawsuits challenging the \ntermination of Medicaid providers through the free-\nchoice-of-provider provision and Section 1983, see \nnote 5, supra (first twelve cases), plus a handful of \ncases challenging other state policies or actions using \nthose statutes, see, e.g., ibid. (next six cases).  All but \nthree of the twelve cases were efforts by states to \ntarget Planned Parenthood in ways courts have \nrecognized \nare \nunwarranted \nand \npolitically \nmotivated.  See, e.g., Bader v. Wernert, 178 F. Supp. \n3d 703, 724 (N.D. Ind. 2016).  They involved \npretextual termination attempts lacking any legal \nbasis or evidentiary support.   \nFurther, the issue has arisen less and less \nfrequently in recent years.  Outside of this case, no \ncourt of appeals has addressed the question presented \nsince 2020.  See note 4, supra.  The small and \ndecreasing number of these cases shows that \npetitioner is wrong to say (Pet. 35) that the court of \nappeals\u2019 decision will lead to additional litigation.  \nThis Court has denied certiorari on this issue multiple \ntimes, see note 1, supra, and the passage of time has \nmade it even more clear that there is no need for this \nCourt\u2019s review.  \nIf this Court potentially were interested in \nconsidering this issue, it should first give the courts of \nappeals the opportunity to consider its recent \nguidance in Talevski.  Only the court of appeals in the \ndecision below \u2013 and no other court \u2013 has had the \nopportunity to consider the effect of Talevski on the \nquestion whether the free-choice-of-provider provision \nconfers a right enforceable under Section 1983.  In \nlight of the decreasing number of cases raising this \nissue, there may never be a need for this Court\u2019s \nreview.  But if petitioner is correct and this remains a \n\n25 \n \n \n \nlive issue, then this Court will have other \nopportunities to consider the issue after other courts \nof appeals have applied the guidance in Talevski. \nII. THE \nUNQUALIFIED-PROVIDER \nISSUE \nDOES NOT WARRANT THIS COURT\u2019S \nREVIEW  \nPetitioner contends (Pet. 33-34) that if the \nMedicaid \nAct\u2019s \nfree-choice-of-provider \nprovision \nconfers an individual right enforceable under Section \n1983, this Court should grant review to decide \nwhether that right extends to providers that a state \nhas labeled \u201c[un]qualified.\u201d  This case does not present \nthat question, because petitioner has conceded \nthroughout the course of this litigation that PPSAT is \na qualified provider.  Further, petitioner forfeited this \nargument by abandoning it in his most recent appeal.  \nThe argument also is mistaken, and there is no \ndisagreement in the courts of appeals on this point.      \nA. Petitioner is wrong to say (Pet. 33) that Ms. \nEdwards is seeking to challenge the exclusion of an \nunqualified provider.  Petitioner in fact has conceded \nat every turn that PPSAT is qualified. \nAs the court of appeals recognized, \u201c[t]here has \nnever been any question during the long path of this \nlitigation that Planned Parenthood is professionally \nqualified to provide the care that plaintiff seeks.\u201d  Pet. \nApp. 33a.  Since the beginning, petitioner has not \ncontested that PPSAT is a qualified provider.  See id. \nat 107a (first court of appeals decision:  \u201cSouth \nCarolina does not contest the fact that PPSAT is \nprofessionally qualified to deliver the services that the \nindividual plaintiff seeks.\u201d); id. at 74a (second court of \nappeals decision:  \u201c[T]here is no dispute as to whether \n[petitioner] asserts PPSAT afforded less than \nadequate care to its patients.  He does not.\u201d); id. at 33a \n\n26 \n \n \n \n(third court of appeals decision:  \u201c\u200aThe State has not \ncontested\u201d \u201cthat Planned Parenthood is professionally \nqualified to provide the care that the plaintiff seeks.\u201d).   \nB. Petitioner has forfeited any argument about \n\u201cthe scope of any alleged right to challenge a state\u2019s \ndisqualification decision\u201d (Pet. 33).  Petitioner made \nan argument along those lines at the preliminary-\ninjunction stage; he argued that he did not violate the \nfree-choice-of-provider provision because a state may \nexclude providers as not \u201c\u200a\u2018qualified\u2019  *  *  *  based on \nany conceivable state interest.\u201d  Pet. App. 109a \n(quoting 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(23)(A)).  Among other \nthings, petitioner relied on O\u2019Bannon v. Town Court \nNursing Center, 447 U.S. 773 (1980).  Pet. App. 111a-\n112a.  But petitioner \u201cd[id] not contest the fact that \nPPSAT is professionally qualified to deliver the \nservices that [Ms. Edwards] seeks.\u201d  Id. at 107a.  The \ndistrict court and court of appeals accordingly rejected \npetitioner\u2019s argument and held that he violated the \nfree-choice-of-provider provision.  Id. at 138a-141a, \n106a-117a.   \nAfter the preliminary-injunction stage, petitioner \nfocused exclusively on the private-right-of-action \nquestion.  On summary judgment in the district court \nand in two rounds of briefing in the court of appeals, \npetitioner argued only that the free-choice-of-provider \nprovision does not give rise to a privately enforceable \nright.  For example, in opposing summary judgment, \npetitioner argued that 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(23)(A) \u201cdoes \nnot authorize a private right of action\u201d for the reasons \n\u201cset forth\u201d in his preliminary-injunction brief.  Pet. D. \nCt. Summ. J. Br. 9, No. 18-cv-2078 (D.S.C. Feb. 24, \n2020).  Petitioner did not argue in the alternative that \nif Section 1983 confers a privately enforceable right, \nhe did not violate that right.  \n\n27 \n \n \n \nThen, on appeal of the summary-judgment \ndecision, petitioner again assumed that PPSAT is \n\u201cqualified\u201d within the meaning of the free-choice-of-\nprovider provision, rather than argue that he did not \nviolate the statute.  See Pet. C.A. Br. 22-30, No. 21-\n1043 (4th Cir. Mar. 29, 2021) (21-1043 Pet. C.A. Br.).  \nIndeed, the court of appeals found it \u201c[n]otabl[e]\u201d that \npetitioner \u201cd[id] not challenge the district court\u2019s \ndetermination (and [the court of appeals\u2019] own \nprevious conclusion) that South Carolina violated this \nprovision.\u201d  Pet. App. 51a n.1.  Petitioner only cited \nO\u2019Bannon for the proposition that the free-choice-of-\nprovider provision is not privately enforceable, id. at \n62a-64a; see 21-1043 Pet. C.A. Br. 22-27; he did not \nseparately argue that his termination of PPSAT\u2019s \nMedicaid participation was justified under O\u2019Bannon.   \nFinally, in his supplemental briefs following \nTalevski, petitioner did not even cite O\u2019Bannon, \ninstead addressing only the private-right-of-action \nissue and arguing that Talevski required the court of \nappeals to reverse its previous holding that the free-\nchoice-of-provider provision is enforceable under \nSection 1983.  Pet. Supp. C.A. Br. 4-16, No. 21-1043 \n(4th Cir. Aug. 23, 2023); Pet. Supp. C.A. Reply Br. 2-\n10, No. 21-1043 (4th Cir. Oct. 13, 2023). \nThe court of appeals did not address petitioner\u2019s \nargument about the scope of the free-choice-of-\nprovider right in 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(23)(A) in the \nsecond appeal because petitioner never presented that \nargument.  This Court should not address the \nargument in the first instance.  See, e.g., Cutter v. \nWilkinson, 544 U.S. 709, 718 n.7 (2005) (\u201c[W]e are a \ncourt of review, not of first view.\u201d).   \nC. To be sure, petitioner\u2019s forfeited argument is \nwrong.  A state may not terminate a provider from \nMedicaid for any reason and then \u201csimply label[]\u201d that \n\n28 \n \n \n \n\u201cexclusionary rule as a \u2018qualification\u2019\u200a\u201d under the free-\nchoice-of-provider provision.  Pet. App. 110a.  The \n\u201cordinary \ndefinition \nof \n\u2018qualified\u2019 \n[is] \nbeing \nprofessionally capable or competent.\u201d  Id. at 107a-\n108a.  Congress adopted that meaning when it \nspecified that \u201cqualified\u201d means \u201cqualified to perform \nthe \nservice \nor \nservices \nrequired.\u201d \n \n42 \nU.S.C. 1396a(a)(23)(A); \nsee \nFederal \nCommc\u2019ns \nComm\u2019n v. AT & T Inc., 562 U.S. 397, 405 (2011) \n(\u201c[W]hen interpreting a statute  *  *  *  we construe \nlanguage  *  *  *  in light of the terms surrounding it.\u201d).   \nA provider \u201cis not made unqualified to perform\u201d \nmedical services \u201cbased on any conceivable state \ninterest.\u201d  Pet. App. 109a.  Instead, a state may \n\u201cconsider[]\u201d a provider not to be \u201cqualified\u201d based only \non the \u201cstandards for the provision of care\u201d that the \nstate has \u201cset.\u201d  S. Rep. No. 744, 90th Cong., 1st Sess. \n183.  Here, South Carolina agreed that PPSAT meets \nthose standards and is professionally capable of \nproviding the care that Ms. Edwards seeks.  See Pet. \nApp. 33a, 58a, 98a n.3, 107a.  South Carolina\u2019s \nargument that \u201cthe term \u2018qualified\u2019 means whatever \nthe state says,\u201d if accepted, \u201cwould strip the free-\nchoice-of-provider provision of all meaning\u201d and would \n\u201ceviscerate the Medicaid Act\u2019s cooperative scheme.\u201d  \nId. at 110a, 116a.   \nD. Finally, and in any event, there is no circuit \nsplit on the unqualified-provider issue.  Petitioner \ncontends (Pet. 33-34) that the Fourth, Seventh, and \nTenth Circuits disagree with the Fifth Circuit on \nwhether O\u2019Bannon holds that the free-choice-of-\nprovider provision does not confer a right to obtain \ncare from a provider that a state has deemed \ndisqualified.  That is incorrect, because the Fifth \nCircuit considered the termination of providers for \ncause, whereas the Fourth, Seventh, and Tenth \n\n29 \n \n \n \nCircuits considered terminations of providers without \ncause.  The different outcomes in the cases are \nexplained by their different facts.    \nSpecifically, O\u2019Bannon rejected nursing home \nresidents\u2019 attempt to challenge the termination of an \nunqualified provider.  447 U.S. at 776-777 & nn.3-4, \n785.  Here, the parties agreed that PPSAT is a \nmedically qualified provider.  The same was true in \nthe Seventh and Tenth Circuit cases.  See Planned \nParenthood of Kan. & Mid-Mo., 882 F.3d at 1236; \nPlanned Parenthood of Ind., 699 F.3d at 978-80.  In \nthat circumstance, O\u2019Bannon said that the patient \ndoes have a right \u201cto choose among a range of qualified \nproviders, without government interference.\u201d  447 \nU.S. at 785; see id. at 785 n.18.  So if O\u2019Bannon applies \nhere, it leads to different results in these different \ncases because they involved different facts.  For that \nreason as well, further review is unwarranted.    \n\n30 \n \n \n \nCONCLUSION \nThe petition for a writ of certiorari should be \ndenied. \nRespectfully submitted. \n \nJENNIFER SANDMAN\nPlanned Parenthood \nFederation of America \n123 William Street \nNew York, NY 10038 \n \nHANNAH SWANSON \nPlanned Parenthood \nFederation of America  \n1110 Vermont Avenue NW, \nSuite 300 \nWashington, DC 20005 \n \n \nNICOLE A.

          "task_beliefs": "My beliefs regarding this specific case are stable, as this observation was an internal consolidation of my current knowledge rather than the introduction of new evidence. My understanding remains centered on the petitioner's (South Carolina's) detailed legal strategy, which forms the argumentative baseline for this case.\n\nMy cumulative understanding is as follows:\n1.  **Core Legal Question:** The central issue is whether the Medicaid Act\u2019s \u201cany qualified provider\u201d provision (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a(a)(23)(A)) unambiguously creates a private right of action for beneficiaries to sue in federal court.\n2.  **Petitioner's Argumentative Framework:** South Carolina's case is built on the premise that recent Supreme Court precedent, specifically *Gonzaga University v. Doe* and *Health & Hospital Corp. v. Talevski*, has established a \"demanding bar\" for finding private rights in Spending Clause legislation. They argue the statutory language must contain \"explicit rights-creating terms.\"\n3.  **Textual and Structural Attack:** The petitioner's primary line of attack is a direct comparison to the statute upheld in *Talevski*.\n    *   **Text:** They highlight that \u00a7 1396a(a)(23)(A) lacks the word \"right,\" instead stating a state plan \"must provide that\" an individual \"may obtain\" care.\n    *   **Structure:** They contrast this with the Federal Nursing Home Reform Act (FNHRA) from *Talevski*, which contained sections explicitly labeled \"rights\" (e.g., \"Transfer and discharge rights\"). The Medicaid provision, in contrast, is just one of 87 requirements in a general \"Contents\" section for state plans.\n4.  **Precedent Strategy:** South Carolina is actively trying to narrow the field of relevant precedent. They argue that the stricter *Gonzaga*/*Talevski* framework has effectively superseded or abandoned older, more lenient tests from cases like *Blessing v. Freestone*, *Wilder v. Virginia Hospital Association*, and *Wright v. City of Roanoke*.\n5.  **Alternative Remedies Argument:** The petitioner posits that Congress intended for other enforcement mechanisms, not individual lawsuits. They point to the Secretary of HHS's authority to withhold federal funds for non-compliance and the existence of state-level administrative appeal processes for providers.\n6.  **Current State of Uncertainty:** This observation confirms that my understanding is now lopsided. I have a detailed map of the petitioner's case but almost no information on the respondent's counter-strategy. My predictive ability is therefore limited until I can analyze the respondent's brief on the merits to understand how they will rebut these specific textual, structural, and precedent-based arguments.",
          "design_beliefs": "My meta-level beliefs about effective legal prediction strategies have been reinforced and slightly refined by this observation. The act of internal reasoning itself provides a lesson on process.\n\nMy cumulative design beliefs are:\n1.  **Validation of the \"Petitioner-First\" Heuristic:** The strategy of prioritizing the petitioner's brief on the merits after understanding the basic facts remains highly effective. It provides the most direct and comprehensive blueprint of one side's case, establishing the core arguments that the respondent must counter.\n2.  **New Heuristic: \"The *Talevski* Litmus Test\":** For any modern case concerning private rights of action under Spending Clause statutes, the most effective analytical starting point is a direct comparison with the statutory text and structure analyzed in *Health & Hospital Corp. v. Talevski*. The presence or absence of explicit \"rights\" language and its structural placement is the central battleground.\n3.  **New Heuristic: \"Precedent Bracketing\":** I have learned to identify a sophisticated argumentative strategy where a party attempts to \"bracket\" or neutralize unfavorable precedents by arguing they have been implicitly overruled by a more recent line of cases. This is a more nuanced analysis than simply counting which precedents favor which side and is a key pattern to detect in legal briefs.\n4.  **Refined Source Prioritization:** The value of primary legal documents (briefs, statutes) over secondary summaries is confirmed. They reveal not just the arguments, but the strategic framing and narrative choices that are critical for prediction.\n5.  **New Process Refinement: \"Consolidate and Plan\":** This observation, being an act of self-reflection, highlights the value of a specific step within the information-gathering loop. After a major information intake (like analyzing a merits brief), it is an effective design principle to pause, explicitly consolidate the current belief state, identify the most significant point of uncertainty, and then formulate the next action to target that specific uncertainty. This makes the experimental design process more deliberate and efficient, preventing aimless information seeking and ensuring each action has the highest possible expected information gain."

Doe, 536 U.S. 273, 280 (2002). \nCongress knows how to create a private right of \naction, but it did not do so here. Amici therefore urge \nthis Court to grant the petition and reverse the deci-\nsion below.  \n \n \n \n1 Pursuant to this Court\u2019s Rule 37.6, counsel for amici curiae \ncertifies that this brief was not authored in whole or in part by \ncounsel for any party and that no person or entity other than \namici curiae or its counsel has made a monetary contribution to \nthe preparation or submission of this brief. Parties received \ntimely notice of this brief. \n\n2 \n \n \nINTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY  \nOF THE ARGUMENT \nIn 2018, South Carolina terminated Planned \nParenthood from the state\u2019s Medicaid program, de-\nclaring abortion clinics unqualified \u201cto provide ser-\nvices to Medicaid beneficiaries.\u201d App. 128a. The order \nstated that \u201cthe payment of taxpayer funds to abortion \nclinics, for any purpose, results in the subsidy of abor-\ntion and the denial of the right to life.\u201d App.158a. And \nit explained that \u201cabortion clinics\u2019 primary focus on \ndenying the right to life is contrary to and conflicts \nwith the State\u2019s obligation to protect and preserve that \nright.\u201d Id. Indeed, South Carolina state law prohibits \nthe use of funds to pay for abortions. See S.C. Code \nAnn. \u00a743-5-1185 (1976).  \nTwo weeks after its termination from the pro-\ngram, Planned Parenthood South Atlantic and one of \nits Medicaid patients, Julie Edwards, sued South Car-\nolina in federal court. They argued that by terminat-\ning Planned Parenthood from the Medicaid program, \nSouth Carolina had violated patients\u2019 right to the \n\u201cqualified provider of their choosing\u201d under the Medi-\ncaid Act. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a71396a(a)(23). The district \ncourt granted Edwards a preliminary injunction. App. \n127a, 146a. On appeal, the Fourth Circuit affirmed, \nholding that Congress unambiguously intended \u201cto \ncreate an individual right enforceable under \u00a71983 in \nthe free-choice-of-provider provision.\u201d App. 83a.  \nThis \nCourt\u2019s \nreview \nis \nbadly \nneeded. \n\u201c[C]onditional spending legislation\u201d like the Medicaid \nAct \u201cdoes not function\u2014and, in particular, does not \n\n3 \n \n \n\u2018secure rights\u2019\u2014like laws enacted under Congress\u2019 \nenumerated legislative powers.\u201d Health & Hosp. Corp. \nof Marion Cnty. v. Talevski, 599 U.S. 166, 200 (2023) \n(Thomas, J., dissenting). Because spending legislation \nrequires the consent and participation of states, any \nasserted rights come into being (if ever) only if a state \nagrees to Medicaid\u2019s conditions and the Secretary ap-\nproves the state\u2019s plan. Those asserted rights could \nthen go out of being if the state later opts out of Med-\nicaid or the Secretary terminates the state\u2019s participa-\ntion. Thus the Act itself does not \u201c[e]ffectually guar[d]\u201d \nor \u201cma[k]e certain\u201d Plaintiffs\u2019 asserted rights. Se-\ncured, Webster, American Dictionary of the English \nLanguage (1828). So, \u201crights provided for in spending \npower legislation\u201d are not \u201c\u2018secured\u2019 as against \nStates.\u201d Talevski, 599 U.S. at 192-93 (Gorsuch, J., con-\ncurring). \nYet even if spending legislation could be the basis \nfor a Section 1983 claim, the any-qualified-provider \nprovision does not meet this Court\u2019s high bar to create \na private right of action. When Congress intends to \ncreate a new right \u201cit must do so in clear and unam-\nbiguous terms.\u201d Gonzaga Univ. v. Doe, 563 U.S. 273, \n290 (2002). Because Congress has not spoken clearly \nhere, \nSection \n1983 \ncannot \nsupport \nPlanned \nParenthood\u2019s claims to a private right of action under \nthe Medicaid Act\u2019s any-qualified-provider provision.  \nFinally, allowing private enforcement of the Med-\nicaid Act\u2019s any-qualified-provider provision will im-\npose substantial costs on both states and the federal \ngovernment. The decision below\u2014if left to stand\u2014will \n\n4 \n \n \nopen the floodgates to costly litigation and breed un-\ncertainty in budgeting. And it will stifle the flexibility \nCongress gave states to innovate in their Medicaid \nprograms.  \nThe Court should grant the petition and reverse \nthe decision below.  \nARGUMENT \nI. \nThe Court should grant the petition be-\ncause Medicaid recipients do not have a \nprivately enforceable right under \u00a71983 \nbased on the Medicaid Act\u2019s any-qualified-\nprovider provision. \nSection 1983 provides a cause of action against \n\u201c[e]very person\u201d who deprives any other \u201cperson\u201d \u201cof \nany rights \u2026 secured by the Constitution and laws.\u201d \n42 U.S.C. \u00a71983. But Section 1983 cannot support \nPlanned Parenthood\u2019s claims. Spending Clause legis-\nlation like the Medicaid Act does not \u201csecure[]\u201d rights \nagainst States. Cf. Talevski, 599 U.S. at 192-93 (Gor-\nsuch, J., concurring). And the language of the Medi-\ncaid Act\u2019s any-qualified-provider provision does not \ncreate private rights. See Armstrong v. Exceptional \nChild Ctr., Inc., 575 U.S. 320, 331-32 (2015) (plural-\nity). \u201c[U]nless Congress \u2018speak[s] with a clear voice,\u2019 \nand manifests an \u2018unambiguous\u2019 intent to confer indi-\nvidual rights, federal funding provisions provide no \nbasis for private enforcement by \u00a71983.\u201d Gonzaga, 536 \nU.S. at 280. Thus the Court should grant the petition \nand reverse the decision below.  \n\n5 \n \n \nA. \nSpending Clause legislation does not \u201cse-\ncure[]\u201d rights against the state.  \nSection 1983 applies only to \u201crights \u2026 secured by \n\u2026 la[w].\u201d While Spending Clause legislation like the \nMedicaid Act is \u201cla[w]\u201d for the purposes of Section \n1983, Talevski, 599 U.S. at 180 (citing Maine v. Thi-\nboutot, 448 U.S. 1, 4 (1980)), such legislation does not \n\u201csecure[]\u201d an individual right to any qualified pro-\nvider, Talevski, 599 U.S. at 192-93 (Gorsuch, J., con-\ncurring) (reserving the question \u201cfor another day\u201d).  \nTo start, conditional spending laws\u2014like the Med-\nicaid Act\u2014do not \u201csecure\u201d rights. Such laws \u201cdo[] not \nfunction \u2026 like laws enacted under Congress\u2019 enumer-\nated legislative powers, such as the Commerce Clause. \nTalevski, 599 U.S. at 200 (Thomas, J., dissenting). Ra-\nther, spending clause legislation requires the consent \nand participation of states to confer benefits to private \nactors. The Spending Clause states that \u201cCongress \nshall have Power\u201d to \u201cprovide for the \u2026 general Wel-\nfare of the United States.\u201d U.S. Const. art. I, \u00a7 8, cl. 1. \nThis provision allows Congress to condition federal \nfunding for states upon compliance with certain con-\nditions. See South Dakota v. Dole, 483 U.S. 203, 206-\n07 (1987). But Congress cannot compel any state to \ncomply with its conditions; each state must \u201cvoluntar-\nily\u201d and \u201cknowingly\u201d accept the terms of Congress\u2019 of-\nfer. Nat\u2019l Fed\u2019n of Indep. Bus. v. Sebelius, 567 U.S. \n519, 577 (2012) (NFIB) (quoting Pennhurst State Sch. \n& Hosp. v. Halderman, 451 U.S. 1, 17 (1981)). Con-\ngress can \u201cuse its spending power to create incentives \nfor States to act in accordance with federal policies. \n\n6 \n \n \nBut when \u2018pressure turns into compulsion,\u2019 the legis-\nlation runs contrary to our system of federalism.\u201d \nNFIB, 567 U.S. at 577-78.  \nLike other conditional spending legislation, \u201cMed-\nicaid offers the States a bargain: Congress provides \nfederal funds in exchange for the States\u2019 agreement to \nspend them in accordance with congressionally im-\nposed conditions.\u201d Armstrong, 575 U.S. at 323. Under \nthis system of cooperative federalism, states create \nMedicaid plans and submit them to the Secretary of \nHealth and Human Services. In turn, the Secretary \ncan approve the state plans and distribute appropri-\nate funds. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a71396-1. Should a state fail to \n\u201csubstantially comply\u201d with the Medicaid Act\u2019s re-\nquirement in the plan\u2019s administration, the Secretary \nmay withhold funds until the state corrects course. \nSee 42 U.S.C. \u00a71396c. \nBecause the provisions of the Medicaid Act have \nforce only after a state has accepted Congress\u2019 terms, \nany rights or benefits under the Act are conditional. \nUnder such laws, any asserted rights would come into \nbeing (if ever) only if a state agrees to Medicaid\u2019s con-\nditions and the Secretary approves the state\u2019s plan. \nThe asserted rights could then go out of being if the \nstate later opts out of Medicaid or the Secretary ter-\nminates the state\u2019s participation. Thus the Act itself \ndoes not \u201c[e]ffectually guar[d]\u201d or \u201cma[k]e certain\u201d \nPlaintiffs\u2019 asserted rights.

So, \u201crights pro-\nvided for in spending power legislation\u201d are not \u201c\u2018se-\ncured\u2019 as against States.\u201d Talevski, 599 U.S. at 192-93 \n(Gorsuch, J., concurring). \nIf spending legislation did function the same way \nas laws enacted under Congress\u2019s regulatory powers, \nit \u201cwould unconstitutionally commandeer the States \nto administer\u201d a whole host of federal programs \u201crang-\ning from welfare, to healthcare, to air quality, and \nmuch more.\u201d Talevski, 599 U.S. at 200-02 (Thomas, J., \ndissenting). A \u201cdefining characteristic\u201d of spending \nlegislation \u201cis the imposition of obligations on States \nthat accept federal funds.\u201d Id. at 202. Viewing a state\u2019s \nbreach of those obligations as \u201cakin to violating rights \nsecured by federal law\u201d is \u201cincompatible with th[e] \nCourt\u2019s anticommandeering doctrine.\u201d Id. Under that \n\u201cbedrock constitutional principle,\u201d \u201cCongress gener-\nally cannot directly regulate the States or require \nthem to implement federal programs.\u201d Id. \nAt bottom, Spending Clause legislation does not \n\u201csecure[]\u201d rights against the states. The any-qualified-\nprovider provision of the Medicaid Act thus cannot \nprovide the basis for Respondents\u2019 Section 1983 \nclaims.  \n \n \n\n8 \n \n \nB. \nIn any event, the Medicaid Act\u2019s any-quali-\nfied-provider provision does not unambigu-\nously create private rights.  \nEven if spending legislation could be the basis for \na Section 1983 claim, the any-qualified-provider pro-\nvision does not meet the \u201cdemanding bar\u201d this Court \nrequires to create a private right of action. Talevski, \n599 U.S. at 180. Last term, the Court clarified that \nGonzaga University v. Doe is the proper \u201cmethod for \nascertaining unambiguous conferral\u201d of private rights. \nId. at 183. And Gonzaga instructs that when Congress \nintends to create a new right \u201cit must do so in clear \nand unambiguous terms.\u201d Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at 290.  \nTo determine whether Congress \u201cunambiguous[ly] \ninten[ded] to confer individual rights,\u201d courts must \nlook to \u201cthe text and structure of\u201d the Act. Id. at 284 \nn.3, 286. The text must have \u201cexplicit \u2018right-or-duty-\ncreating language.\u2019\u201d Id. at 284 n.3. Importantly, \u201cit is \nrights, not the broader or vaguer \u2018benefits\u2019 or \u2018inter-\nests,\u2019 that may be enforced under\u201d Section 1983. Id. \nat 283. And this Court cannot \u201cimpute \u2026 an intent to \ncreate a private right.\u201d Id. at 284 n.3.  \nStatutes that merely place an obligation upon the \nstates (once they opt-in) to provide a benefit, absent \nclear rights language, fall short of creating a private \nenforcement right under Section 1983. Take Gonzaga \nitself. In that case, a Gonzaga University employee \ndisclosed the details of an alleged sexual misconduct \ninvestigation against a former student to an outside \nparty, and that student lost employment opportuni-\nties as a result. Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at 277. The student \n\n9 \n \n \nsued Gonzaga under Section 1983, alleging that the \nUniversity released his personal information to an \n\u201cunauthorized person\u201d in violation of the Family Edu-\ncational Rights and Privacy Act. Id. \nCongress \u201cenacted FERPA under its spending \npower to condition the receipt of federal funds on cer-\ntain requirements relating to the access and disclo-\nsure of student educational records.\u201d Id. at 278. The \nAct \u201cdirects the Secretary of Education to withhold \nfederal funds from any public or private \u2018educational \nagency or institution\u2019 that fails to comply with these \nconditions.\u201d Id. It states: \nNo funds shall be made available under any \napplicable program to any educational agency \nor institution which has a policy or practice of \npermitting the release of education records (or \npersonally identifiable information contained \ntherein ...) of students without the written \nconsent of their parents to any individual, \nagency, or organization.  \nId. at 279 (quoting 20 U.S.C. \u00a71232g(b)(1)). The stu-\ndent argued that this \u201cstatutory regime confers upon \nany student enrolled at a covered school or institution \na federal right, enforceable in suits for damages under \n\u00a71983, not to have \u2018education records\u2019 disclosed to un-\nauthorized persons without the student\u2019s express \nwritten consent.\u201d Id.  \nBut this Court held that \u201cspending legislation \ndrafted\u201d in those terms cannot \u201cconfer enforceable \nrights.\u201d Id. The Court noted the nondisclosure provi-\n\n10 \n \n \nsions \u201centirely lack the sort of \u2018rights-creating\u2019 lan-\nguage critical to showing the requisite congressional \nintent to create new rights.\u201d Id. at 287. And it ex-\nplained that those provisions \u201cspeak only to the Secre-\ntary of Education.\u201d Id. The Court concluded that there \nwas \u201cno question\u201d that the nondisclosure provisions \n\u201cfail to confer enforceable rights.\u201d Id. \nWhen this Court has determined that Congress in-\ntended a private right of action, the statutory lan-\nguage was much clearer. Examples of unambiguous \nrights include Title VI, \u201cNo person \u2026 shall \u2026 be sub-\njected to discrimination,\u201d id. at 284 n.3, 287, and pro-\nvisions that \u201cexpressly\u201d create \u201crights,\u201d Talevski, 599 \nU.S. at 184. In Health and Hospital Corporation of \nMarion County v. Talevski, a dementia patient\u2019s fam-\nily sued a nursing home for administering chemical \nrestraints and attempting to force his transfer to a dif-\nferent facility. Id. at 172-73. The Federal Nursing \nHome Reform Act provides that \u201cA nursing facility \nmust protect and promote the rights of each resident, \nincluding \u2026 The right to be from \u2026 any physical or \nchemical restraints.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a71396r(c)(1)(A)(ii). \nAnd under a section titled \u201cTransfer and Discharge \nRights\u201d the statute provides specific conditions which \nmust be met before a nursing home can forcibly dis-\ncharge a patient. U.S.C. \u00a71396r(c)(2)(A)-(B). Applying \nthe Gonzaga test, the Court held that these provisions \nwere enforceable under Section 1983 because they \nboth contained explicit rights language and have \u201can \nunmistakable focus on the benefited class\u201d as opposed \n\n11 \n \n \nto the conditions under which funds ought to be dis-\ntributed. Talevski, 599 U.S. at 183-86 (quoting Gon-\nzaga, 536 U.S. at 284). \nThe Medicaid Act\u2019s any-qualified-provider clause \nresembles the provision at issue in Gonzaga much \nmore than the provision in Talevski. That provision is \nstyled as follows: \u201cA state plan for medical assistance \nmust \u2026 provide \u2026\u201d \u00a71396a(a). It is not styled as a pro-\ntective prohibition. Nor does it \u201cexpressly\u201d confer \n\u201crights.\u201d Talevski, 599 U.S. at 184. And the mandatory \nlanguage\u2014\u201cmust provide\u201d\u2014is not enough to create \nrights. Armstrong, 575 U.S. at 323, 328-29. Section \n1396a tells \u201c[t]he Secretary\u201d what \u201cconditions\u201d state \nplans must \u201cfulfil[l]\u201d before he \u201cshall approve\u201d them. \n\u00a71396a(a), (b). A focus on the requirements for the Sec-\nretary\u2019s approval \u201cdoes not confer the sort of \u2018individ-\nual entitlement\u2019 that is enforceable under \u00a71983.\u201d \nGonzaga, 536 U.S. at 287. And given its placement un-\nder subsection (a), the any-qualified-provider provi-\nsion is \u201cphrased as a directive to the federal agency \ncharged with approving state Medicaid plans, not as a \nconferral of the right to sue upon the beneficiaries.\u201d \nArmstrong, 575 U.S. at 331 (plurality opinion). At the \nvery least, the provision\u2019s \u201ctext and structure\u201d create \nan ambiguity that defeats Planned Parenthood\u2019s \nclaims. Cf. Talevski, 599 U.S. at 193 (Barrett, J., con-\ncurring) (quoting Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at 283, 286). \n \n \n \n\n12 \n \n \nII.  The Court should grant the petition to limit \ncostly litigation, ensure predictability in \nbudgeting, and honor the flexibility Con-\ngress gave states to innovate. \nAllowing private enforcement of the Medicaid \nAct\u2019s any-qualified-provider provision will impose \nsubstantial costs on both states and the federal gov-\nernment. The decision below\u2014if left to stand\u2014will in-\ncrease costly litigation and breed uncertainty in budg-\neting. And it will stifle the flexibility Congress gave \nstates to innovate in their Medicaid programs.  \nMedicaid costs have become staggeringly high. \nThe total cost for the Medicaid program in 2020 was \n$824 billion dollars. Total Medicaid Spending, KFF \n(June 26, 2024), shorturl.at/pP4lk. And since Medi-\ncaid is jointly funded by the states, they bear substan-\ntial costs too. See Medicaid: An Overview, Cong. Re-\nsearch Serv. 18 (2019). On average, states spend 29% \nof their annual budgets on costs related to Medicaid. \nSee Medicaid Expenditures as a Percent of Total State \nExpenditures by Fund, KFF (June 26, 2024), \nshorturl.at/TpzFT. That makes Medicaid the costliest \nexpenditure for many state budgets, surpassing pri-\nmary and secondary education spending combined. \nNat\u2019l Ass\u2019n of State Budget Officers, State Expenditure \nReport (2023), shorturl.at/EU2gy. \nLitigation is a major factor driving up the costs of \nMedicaid. See, e.g., U.S. Dep\u2019t of Health & Hum. \nServs., Addressing the New Health Care Crisis: Re-\nforming the Medical Litigation System to Improve the \n\n13 \n \n \nQuality of Health Care (2003). Defending lawsuits of-\nten take years to resolve and can cost taxpayers mil-\nlions. See, e.g., Texas: A Cautionary Tale for Medicaid \nManagement and Managed Care Companies, Mintz \n(July 8, 2018) (discussing \u201c14-year old lawsuit\u201d over \nMedicaid reimbursement rates); Mary Jo Pitzl, 5 \nYears, $7 Million in Legal Fees and No End in Sight: \nFoster-Care Lawsuit Drags On,  AZ Central (Feb. 11, \n2020) (discussing \u201cfive-year legal battle\u201d that has \u201ccost \ntaxpayers more than $7 million\u201d); Kelli Kennedy, Flor-\nida Reaches Settlement in Kids\u2019 Medicaid Case, The \nLedger (Apr. 5, 2016) (discussing Florida\u2019s \u201cdecades[-\n]long class-action lawsuit,\u201d which cost the state \u201cwell \nover $7 million\u201d to defend). Even one unfavorable ju-\ndicial decision can impose budget-busting costs. Texas \nstate officials predicted one case would cost the state \n\u201canywhere from $1 billion to $5 billion.\u201d See, e.g., Rob-\nert T. Garrett, Medicaid Ruling May Hit Surplus: Up-\ngrading Kids\u2019 Care Could Carry $5B tab, The Dallas \nMorning News (Mar. 7, 2007). \nThese increased costs will stifle the flexibility \nCongress provided states to innovate in their Medi-\ncaid programs. Congress offered this flexibility so \nstates could \u201ctry new or different approaches to the \ndelivery of heath care services\u201d and \u201cadapt their pro-\ngrams to the special needs of particular geographic ar-\neas of groups of Medicaid enrollees.\u201d See Medicaid: An \nOverview, supra, at 18. Indeed, this flexibility allows \nfor \u201csubstantial variation\u201d among state programs in \n\u201cMedicaid eligibility, covered benefits, and provider \npayment rates.\u201d Id. If this Court opens the Medicaid \nAct to third party enforcement, it will force states to \n\n14 \n \n \nweigh the risk of those potential private-enforcement \nsuits when deciding whether to innovate. That under-\nmines Congress\u2019s desire for flexibility.  \nOn top of that, the current trajectory of the Med-\nicaid program is unsustainable. Even if Congress had \nintended to create an individual right through the \nMedicaid Act (which it did not), the \u201ceconomic reality\u201d \nof Medicaid shows that \u201cthe United States simply can-\nnot afford\u201d the attendant costs associated with a pri-\nvate right of action to enforce it.

Doe, 536 U.S. 273, 280 (2002). \nCongress knows how to create a private right of \naction, but it did not do so here. Amici therefore urge \nthis Court to reverse the decision below.  \n \n \n \n1 Pursuant to this Court\u2019s Rule 37.6, counsel for amici curiae \ncertifies that this brief was not authored in whole or in part by \ncounsel for any party and that no person or entity other than \namici curiae or its counsel has made a monetary contribution to \nthe preparation or submission of this brief.  \n\n2 \n \n \nINTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY  \nOF THE ARGUMENT \nIn 2018, South Carolina terminated Planned \nParenthood from the state\u2019s Medicaid program, de-\nclaring abortion clinics unqualified \u201cto provide ser-\nvices to Medicaid beneficiaries.\u201d App. 128a. The order \nstated that \u201cthe payment of taxpayer funds to abortion \nclinics, for any purpose, results in the subsidy of abor-\ntion and the denial of the right to life.\u201d App.158a. And \nit explained that \u201cabortion clinics\u2019 primary focus on \ndenying the right to life is contrary to and conflicts \nwith the State\u2019s obligation to protect and preserve that \nright.\u201d Id. Indeed, South Carolina state law prohibits \nthe use of funds to pay for abortions. See S.C. Code \nAnn. \u00a743-5-1185 (1976).  \nTwo weeks after its termination from the pro-\ngram, Planned Parenthood South Atlantic and one of \nits Medicaid patients, Julie Edwards, sued South Car-\nolina in federal court. They argued that by terminat-\ning Planned Parenthood from the Medicaid program, \nSouth Carolina had violated patients\u2019 right to the \n\u201cqualified provider of their choosing\u201d under the Medi-\ncaid Act. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a71396a(a)(23). The district \ncourt granted Edwards a preliminary injunction. App. \n127a, 146a. On appeal, the Fourth Circuit affirmed, \nholding that Congress unambiguously intended \u201cto \ncreate an individual right enforceable under \u00a71983 in \nthe free-choice-of-provider provision.\u201d App. 83a.   \nThat decision is wrong. \u201c[C]onditional spending \nlegislation\u201d like the Medicaid Act \u201cdoes not function\u2014\nand, in particular, does not \u2018secure rights\u2019\u2014like laws \n\n3 \n \n \nenacted under Congress\u2019 enumerated legislative pow-\ners.\u201d Health & Hosp. Corp. of Marion Cnty. v. Talevski, \n599 U.S. 166, 200 (2023) (Thomas, J., dissenting). Be-\ncause spending legislation requires the consent and \nparticipation of states, any asserted rights come into \nbeing (if ever) only if a state agrees to Medicaid\u2019s con-\nditions and the Secretary approves the state\u2019s plan. \nThose asserted rights could then go out of being if the \nstate later opts out of Medicaid or the Secretary ter-\nminates the state\u2019s participation. Thus the Act itself \ndoes not \u201c[e]ffectually guar[d]\u201d or \u201cma[k]e certain\u201d \nPlaintiffs\u2019 asserted rights. Secured, Webster, Ameri-\ncan Dictionary of the English Language (1828). So, \n\u201crights provided for in spending power legislation\u201d are \nnot \u201c\u2018secured\u2019 as against States.\u201d Talevski, 599 U.S. at \n192-93 (Gorsuch, J., concurring). \nYet even if spending legislation could be the basis \nfor a Section 1983 claim, the any-qualified-provider \nprovision does not meet this Court\u2019s high bar to create \na private right of action. When Congress intends to \ncreate a new right \u201cit must do so in clear and unam-\nbiguous terms.\u201d Gonzaga Univ. v. Doe, 563 U.S. 273, \n290 (2002). Because Congress has not spoken clearly \nhere, \nSection \n1983 \ncannot \nsupport \nPlanned \nParenthood\u2019s claims to a private right of action under \nthe Medicaid Act\u2019s any-qualified-provider provision.  \nFinally, allowing private enforcement of the Med-\nicaid Act\u2019s any-qualified-provider provision will im-\npose substantial costs on both states and the federal \ngovernment. The decision below\u2014if left to stand\u2014will \nopen the floodgates to costly litigation and breed un-\ncertainty in budgeting. And it will stifle the flexibility \n\n4 \n \n \nCongress gave states to innovate in their Medicaid \nprograms.  \nThe Court should reverse the decision below.  \nARGUMENT \nI. \nMedicaid recipients do not have a privately \nenforceable right under \u00a71983 based on the \nMedicaid Act\u2019s any-qualified-provider pro-\nvision. \nSection 1983 provides a cause of action against \n\u201c[e]very person\u201d who deprives any other \u201cperson\u201d \u201cof \nany rights \u2026 secured by the Constitution and laws.\u201d \n42 U.S.C. \u00a71983. But Section 1983 cannot support \nPlanned Parenthood\u2019s claims. Spending Clause legis-\nlation like the Medicaid Act does not \u201csecure[]\u201d rights \nagainst States. Cf. Talevski, 599 U.S. at 192-93 (Gor-\nsuch, J., concurring). And the language of the Medi-\ncaid Act\u2019s any-qualified-provider provision does not \ncreate private rights. See Armstrong v. Exceptional \nChild Ctr., Inc., 575 U.S. 320, 331-32 (2015) (plural-\nity). \u201c[U]nless Congress \u2018speak[s] with a clear voice,\u2019 \nand manifests an \u2018unambiguous\u2019 intent to confer indi-\nvidual rights, federal funding provisions provide no \nbasis for private enforcement by \u00a71983.\u201d Gonzaga, 536 \nU.S. at 280. Thus the Court should reverse the deci-\nsion below.  \n \n \n \n\n5 \n \n \nA. \nSpending Clause legislation does not \u201cse-\ncure[]\u201d rights against the state.  \nSection 1983 applies only to \u201crights \u2026 secured by \n\u2026 la[w].\u201d While Spending Clause legislation like the \nMedicaid Act is \u201cla[w]\u201d for the purposes of Section \n1983, Talevski, 599 U.S. at 180 (citing Maine v. Thi-\nboutot, 448 U.S. 1, 4 (1980)), such legislation does not \n\u201csecure[]\u201d an individual right to any qualified pro-\nvider, Talevski, 599 U.S. at 192-93 (Gorsuch, J., con-\ncurring) (reserving the question \u201cfor another day\u201d).  \nTo start, conditional spending laws\u2014like the Med-\nicaid Act\u2014do not \u201csecure\u201d rights. Such laws \u201cdo[] not \nfunction \u2026 like laws enacted under Congress\u2019 enumer-\nated legislative powers, such as the Commerce \nClause.\u201d Talevski, 599 U.S. at 200 (Thomas, J., dis-\nsenting). Rather, spending clause legislation requires \nthe consent and participation of states to confer bene-\nfits to private actors. The Spending Clause states that \n\u201cCongress shall have Power\u201d to \u201cprovide for the \u2026 gen-\neral Welfare of the United States.\u201d U.S. Const. art. I, \n\u00a7 8, cl. 1. This provision allows Congress to condition \nfederal funding for states upon compliance with cer-\ntain conditions. See South Dakota v. Dole, 483 U.S. \n203, 206-07 (1987). But Congress cannot compel any \nstate to comply with its conditions; each state must \n\u201cvoluntarily\u201d and \u201cknowingly\u201d accept the terms of Con-\ngress\u2019 offer. Nat\u2019l Fed\u2019n of Indep. Bus. v. Sebelius, 567 \nU.S. 519, 577 (2012) (NFIB) (quoting Pennhurst State \nSch. & Hosp. v. Halderman, 451 U.S. 1, 17 (1981)). \nCongress can \u201cuse its spending power to create incen-\ntives for States to act in accordance with federal poli-\ncies. But when \u2018pressure turns into compulsion,\u2019 the \n\n6 \n \n \nlegislation runs contrary to our system of federalism.\u201d \nNFIB, 567 U.S. at 577-78.  \nLike other conditional spending legislation, \u201cMed-\nicaid offers the States a bargain: Congress provides \nfederal funds in exchange for the States\u2019 agreement to \nspend them in accordance with congressionally im-\nposed conditions.\u201d Armstrong, 575 U.S. at 323. Under \nthis system of cooperative federalism, states create \nMedicaid plans and submit them to the Secretary of \nHealth and Human Services. In turn, the Secretary \ncan approve the state plans and distribute appropri-\nate funds. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a71396-1. Should a state fail to \n\u201csubstantially comply\u201d with the Medicaid Act\u2019s re-\nquirement in the plan\u2019s administration, the Secretary \nmay withhold funds until the state corrects course. \nSee 42 U.S.C. \u00a71396c. \nBecause the provisions of the Medicaid Act have \nforce only after a state has accepted Congress\u2019 terms, \nany rights or benefits under the Act are conditional. \nUnder such laws, any asserted rights would come into \nbeing (if ever) only if a state agrees to Medicaid\u2019s con-\nditions and the Secretary approves the state\u2019s plan. \nThe asserted rights could then go out of being if the \nstate later opts out of Medicaid or the Secretary ter-\nminates the state\u2019s participation. Thus the Act itself \ndoes not \u201c[e]ffectually guar[d]\u201d or \u201cma[k]e certain\u201d \nPlaintiffs\u2019 asserted rights. Secured, Webster, Ameri-\ncan Dictionary of the English Language (1828) (\u201cTo \nguard effectually from danger; to make safe \u2026 To \nmake certain\u201d). See also Secure, Johnson, A Dictionary \nof the English Language (4th ed. 1773) (\u201cTo make cer-\ntain; to put out of hazard; \u2026 To protect; to make safe\u201d); \n\n7 \n \n \nSecure, Webster, Revised Unabridged Dictionary \n(1913) (\u201c[T]o relieve from apprehensions of, or expo-\nsure to, danger \u2026 To put beyond the hazard of losing \nand not receiving; to make certain.\u201d). So, \u201crights pro-\nvided for in spending power legislation\u201d are not \u201c\u2018se-\ncured\u2019 as against States.\u201d Talevski, 599 U.S. at 192-93 \n(Gorsuch, J., concurring). \nIf spending legislation did function the same way \nas laws enacted under Congress\u2019s regulatory powers, \nit \u201cwould unconstitutionally commandeer the States \nto administer\u201d a whole host of federal programs \u201crang-\ning from welfare, to healthcare, to air quality, and \nmuch more.\u201d Talevski, 599 U.S. at 200-02 (Thomas, J., \ndissenting). A \u201cdefining characteristic\u201d of spending \nlegislation \u201cis the imposition of obligations on States \nthat accept federal funds.\u201d Id. at 202. Viewing a state\u2019s \nbreach of those obligations as \u201cakin to violating rights \nsecured by federal law\u201d is \u201cincompatible with th[e] \nCourt\u2019s anticommandeering doctrine.\u201d Id. Under that \n\u201cbedrock constitutional principle,\u201d \u201cCongress gener-\nally cannot directly regulate the States or require \nthem to implement federal programs.\u201d Id. \nAt bottom, Spending Clause legislation does not \n\u201csecure[]\u201d rights against the states. The any-qualified-\nprovider provision of the Medicaid Act thus cannot \nprovide the basis for Respondents\u2019 Section 1983 \nclaims.  \n \n \n\n8 \n \n \nB. \nIn any event, the Medicaid Act\u2019s any-quali-\nfied-provider provision does not unambigu-\nously create private rights.  \nEven if spending legislation could be the basis for \na Section 1983 claim, the any-qualified-provider pro-\nvision does not meet the \u201cdemanding bar\u201d this Court \nrequires to create a private right of action. Talevski, \n599 U.S. at 180. Two years ago, the Court clarified \nthat Gonzaga University v. Doe is the proper \u201cmethod \nfor ascertaining unambiguous conferral\u201d of private \nrights. Id. at 183. And Gonzaga instructs that when \nCongress intends to create a new right \u201cit must do so \nin clear and unambiguous terms.\u201d Gonzaga, 536 U.S. \nat 290.  \nTo determine whether Congress \u201cunambiguous[ly] \ninten[ded] to confer individual rights,\u201d courts must \nlook to \u201cthe text and structure of\u201d the Act. Id. at 284 \nn.3, 286. The text must have \u201cexplicit \u2018right-or-duty-\ncreating language.\u2019\u201d Id. at 284 n.3. Importantly, \u201cit is \nrights, not the broader or vaguer \u2018benefits\u2019 or \u2018inter-\nests,\u2019 that may be enforced under\u201d Section 1983. Id. \nat 283. And this Court cannot \u201cimpute \u2026 an intent to \ncreate a private right.\u201d Id. at 284 n.3.  \nStatutes that merely place an obligation upon the \nstates (once they opt-in) to provide a benefit, absent \nclear rights language, fall short of creating a private \nenforcement right under Section 1983. Take Gonzaga \nitself. In that case, a Gonzaga University employee \ndisclosed the details of an alleged sexual misconduct \ninvestigation against a former student to an outside \n\n9 \n \n \nparty, and that student lost employment opportuni-\nties as a result. Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at 277. The student \nsued Gonzaga under Section 1983, alleging that the \nUniversity released his personal information to an \n\u201cunauthorized person\u201d in violation of the Family Edu-\ncational Rights and Privacy Act. Id. \nCongress \u201cenacted FERPA under its spending \npower to condition the receipt of federal funds on cer-\ntain requirements relating to the access and disclo-\nsure of student educational records.\u201d Id. at 278. The \nAct \u201cdirects the Secretary of Education to withhold \nfederal funds from any public or private \u2018educational \nagency or institution\u2019 that fails to comply with these \nconditions.\u201d Id. It states: \nNo funds shall be made available under any \napplicable program to any educational agency \nor institution which has a policy or practice of \npermitting the release of education records (or \npersonally identifiable information contained \ntherein ...) of students without the written \nconsent of their parents to any individual, \nagency, or organization.  \nId. at 279 (quoting 20 U.S.C. \u00a71232g(b)(1)). The stu-\ndent argued that this \u201cstatutory regime confers upon \nany student enrolled at a covered school or institution \na federal right, enforceable in suits for damages under \n\u00a71983, not to have \u2018education records\u2019 disclosed to un-\nauthorized persons without the student\u2019s express \nwritten consent.\u201d Id.  \nBut this Court held that \u201cspending legislation \ndrafted\u201d in those terms cannot \u201cconfer enforceable \n\n10 \n \n \nrights.\u201d Id. The Court noted the nondisclosure provi-\nsions \u201centirely lack the sort of \u2018rights-creating\u2019 lan-\nguage critical to showing the requisite congressional \nintent to create new rights.\u201d Id. at 287. And it ex-\nplained that those provisions \u201cspeak only to the Secre-\ntary of Education.\u201d Id. The Court concluded that there \nwas \u201cno question\u201d that the nondisclosure provisions \n\u201cfail to confer enforceable rights.\u201d Id. \nWhen this Court has determined that Congress in-\ntended a private right of action, the statutory lan-\nguage was much clearer. Examples of unambiguous \nrights include \u201cindividually focused terminology\u201d like \nTitle VI\u2019s command that \u201cNo person \u2026 shall \u2026 be sub-\njected to discrimination,\u201d id. at 284 n.3, 287, and pro-\nvisions that \u201cexpressly\u201d create \u201crights,\u201d Talevski, 599 \nU.S. at 184. In Health and Hospital Corporation of \nMarion County v. Talevski, a dementia patient\u2019s fam-\nily sued a nursing home for administering chemical \nrestraints and attempting to force his transfer to a dif-\nferent facility. Id. at 172-73. The Federal Nursing \nHome Reform Act provides that \u201cA nursing facility \nmust protect and promote the rights of each resident, \nincluding \u2026 The right to be from \u2026 any physical or \nchemical restraints.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a71396r(c)(1)(A)(ii). \nAnd under a section titled \u201cTransfer and Discharge \nRights\u201d the statute provides specific conditions which \nmust be met before a nursing home can forcibly dis-\ncharge a patient. 42 U.S.C. \u00a71396r(c)(2)(A)-(B). Apply-\ning the Gonzaga test, the Court held that these provi-\nsions were enforceable under Section 1983 because \nthey both contained explicit rights language and have \n\n11 \n \n \n\u201can unmistakable focus on the benefited class\u201d as op-\nposed to the conditions under which funds ought to be \ndistributed. Talevski, 599 U.S. at 183-86 (quoting \nGonzaga, 536 U.S. at 284). \nThe Medicaid Act\u2019s any-qualified-provider clause \nresembles the provision at issue in Gonzaga much \nmore than the provision in Talevski. That provision is \nstyled as follows: \u201cA state plan for medical assistance \nmust \u2026 provide \u2026\u201d \u00a71396a(a). It is not styled as a pro-\ntective prohibition. Nor does it \u201cexpressly\u201d confer \n\u201crights.\u201d Talevski, 599 U.S. at 184. And the mandatory \nlanguage\u2014\u201cmust provide\u201d\u2014is not enough to create \nrights. Armstrong, 575 U.S. at 323, 328-29. Section \n1396a tells \u201c[t]he Secretary\u201d what \u201cconditions\u201d state \nplans must \u201cfulfil[l]\u201d before he \u201cshall approve\u201d them. \n\u00a71396a(a), (b). A focus on the requirements for the Sec-\nretary\u2019s approval \u201cdoes not confer the sort of \u2018individ-\nual entitlement\u2019 that is enforceable under \u00a71983.\u201d \nGonzaga, 536 U.S. at 287. And given its placement un-\nder subsection (a), the any-qualified-provider provi-\nsion is \u201cphrased as a directive to the federal agency \ncharged with approving state Medicaid plans, not as a \nconferral of the right to sue upon the beneficiaries.\u201d \nArmstrong, 575 U.S. at 331 (plurality opinion). At the \nvery least, the provision\u2019s \u201ctext and structure\u201d create \nan ambiguity that defeats Planned Parenthood\u2019s \nclaims. Cf. Talevski, 599 U.S. at 193 (Barrett, J., con-\ncurring) (quoting Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at 283, 286). \n \n \n \n\n12 \n \n \nII.  Reversing the decision below will limit \ncostly litigation, ensure predictability in \nbudgeting, and honor the flexibility Con-\ngress gave states to innovate. \nAllowing private enforcement of the Medicaid \nAct\u2019s any-qualified-provider provision will impose \nsubstantial costs on both states and the federal gov-\nernment. The decision below\u2014if left to stand\u2014will in-\ncrease costly litigation and breed uncertainty in budg-\neting. And it will stifle the flexibility Congress gave \nstates to innovate in their Medicaid programs.  \nMedicaid costs have become staggeringly high. \nThe total cost for the Medicaid program in 2020 was \n$824 billion dollars. Total Medicaid Spending, KFF \n(June 26, 2024), shorturl.at/pP4lk. And since Medi-\ncaid is jointly funded by the states, they bear substan-\ntial costs too. See Medicaid: An Overview, Cong. Re-\nsearch Serv. 18 (2019). On average, states spend 29% \nof their annual budgets on costs related to Medicaid. \nSee Medicaid Expenditures as a Percent of Total State \nExpenditures by Fund, KFF (June 26, 2024), \nshorturl.at/TpzFT. That makes Medicaid the costliest \nexpenditure for many state budgets, surpassing pri-\nmary and secondary education spending combined. \nNat\u2019l Ass\u2019n of State Budget Officers, State Expenditure \nReport (2023), shorturl.at/EU2gy. \nLitigation is a major factor driving up the costs of \nMedicaid. See, e.g., U.S. Dep\u2019t of Health & Hum. \nServs., Addressing the New Health Care Crisis: Re-\nforming the Medical Litigation System to Improve the \n\n13 \n \n \nQuality of Health Care (2003). Defending lawsuits of-\nten take years to resolve and can cost taxpayers mil-\nlions. See, e.g., Texas: A Cautionary Tale for Medicaid \nManagement and Managed Care Companies, Mintz \n(July 8, 2018) (discussing \u201c14-year old lawsuit\u201d over \nMedicaid reimbursement rates); Mary Jo Pitzl, 5 \nYears, $7 Million in Legal Fees and No End in Sight: \nFoster-Care Lawsuit Drags On,  AZ Central (Feb. 11, \n2020) (discussing \u201cfive-year legal battle\u201d that has \u201ccost \ntaxpayers more than $7 million\u201d); Kelli Kennedy, Flor-\nida Reaches Settlement in Kids\u2019 Medicaid Case, The \nLedger (Apr. 5, 2016) (discussing Florida\u2019s \u201cdecades[-\n]long class-action lawsuit,\u201d which cost the state \u201cwell \nover $7 million\u201d to defend). Even one unfavorable ju-\ndicial decision can impose budget-busting costs. Texas \nstate officials predicted one case would cost the state \n\u201canywhere from $1 billion to $5 billion.\u201d See, e.g., Rob-\nert T. Garrett, Medicaid Ruling May Hit Surplus: Up-\ngrading Kids\u2019 Care Could Carry $5B tab, The Dallas \nMorning News (Mar. 7, 2007). \nThese increased costs will stifle the flexibility \nCongress provided states to innovate in their Medi-\ncaid programs. Congress offered this flexibility so \nstates could \u201ctry new or different approaches to the \ndelivery of health care services\u201d and \u201cadapt their pro-\ngrams to the special needs of particular geographic ar-\neas of groups of Medicaid enrollees.\u201d See Medicaid: An \nOverview, supra, at 18. Indeed, this flexibility allows \nfor \u201csubstantial variation\u201d among state programs in \n\u201cMedicaid eligibility, covered benefits, and provider \npayment rates.\u201d Id. If this Court opens the Medicaid \nAct to third party enforcement, it will force states to \n\n14 \n \n \nweigh the risk of those potential private-enforcement \nsuits when deciding whether to innovate. That under-\nmines Congress\u2019s desire for flexibility.  \nOn top of that, the current trajectory of the Medi-\ncaid program is unsustainable. Even if Congress had \nintended to create an individual right through the \nMedicaid Act (which it did not), the \u201ceconomic reality\u201d \nof Medicaid shows that \u201cthe United States simply can-\nnot afford\u201d the attendant costs associated with a pri-\nvate right of action to enforce it. Mark A. Ison, Two \nWrongs Don\u2019t Make a Right: Medicaid, Section 1983 \nand the Two Wrongs Don\u2019t Make a Right: Medicaid, \nSection 1983 and the Cost of an Enforceable Right to \nHealth Care, 56 Vand. L. Rev. 1479, 1514 (2003). The \nlong-term \nsustainability \nof \nMedicaid \nrequires \nmeasures that will stem the exponential rise in the \ncost of the program\u2014not increase them. \nAn\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

Doe, 536 U.S. 273, 280 (2002). \nCongress knows how to create a private right of \naction, but it did not do so here. Amici therefore urge \nthis Court to grant the petition and reverse the deci-\nsion below.  \n \n \n \n1 Pursuant to this Court\u2019s Rule 37.6, counsel for amici curiae \ncertifies that this brief was not authored in whole or in part by \ncounsel for any party and that no person or entity other than \namici curiae or its counsel has made a monetary contribution to \nthe preparation or submission of this brief. Parties received \ntimely notice of this brief. \n\n2 \n \n \nINTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY  \nOF THE ARGUMENT \nIn 2018, South Carolina terminated Planned \nParenthood from the state\u2019s Medicaid program, de-\nclaring abortion clinics unqualified \u201cto provide ser-\nvices to Medicaid beneficiaries.\u201d App. 128a. The order \nstated that \u201cthe payment of taxpayer funds to abortion \nclinics, for any purpose, results in the subsidy of abor-\ntion and the denial of the right to life.\u201d App.158a. And \nit explained that \u201cabortion clinics\u2019 primary focus on \ndenying the right to life is contrary to and conflicts \nwith the State\u2019s obligation to protect and preserve that \nright.\u201d Id. Indeed, South Carolina state law prohibits \nthe use of funds to pay for abortions. See S.C. Code \nAnn. \u00a743-5-1185 (1976).  \nTwo weeks after its termination from the pro-\ngram, Planned Parenthood South Atlantic and one of \nits Medicaid patients, Julie Edwards, sued South Car-\nolina in federal court. They argued that by terminat-\ning Planned Parenthood from the Medicaid program, \nSouth Carolina had violated patients\u2019 right to the \n\u201cqualified provider of their choosing\u201d under the Medi-\ncaid Act. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a71396a(a)(23). The district \ncourt granted Edwards a preliminary injunction. App. \n127a, 146a. On appeal, the Fourth Circuit affirmed, \nholding that Congress unambiguously intended \u201cto \ncreate an individual right enforceable under \u00a71983 in \nthe free-choice-of-provider provision.\u201d App. 83a.  \nThis \nCourt\u2019s \nreview \nis \nbadly \nneeded. \n\u201c[C]onditional spending legislation\u201d like the Medicaid \nAct \u201cdoes not function\u2014and, in particular, does not \n\n3 \n \n \n\u2018secure rights\u2019\u2014like laws enacted under Congress\u2019 \nenumerated legislative powers.\u201d Health & Hosp. Corp. \nof Marion Cnty. v. Talevski, 599 U.S. 166, 200 (2023) \n(Thomas, J., dissenting). Because spending legislation \nrequires the consent and participation of states, any \nasserted rights come into being (if ever) only if a state \nagrees to Medicaid\u2019s conditions and the Secretary ap-\nproves the state\u2019s plan. Those asserted rights could \nthen go out of being if the state later opts out of Med-\nicaid or the Secretary terminates the state\u2019s participa-\ntion. Thus the Act itself does not \u201c[e]ffectually guar[d]\u201d \nor \u201cma[k]e certain\u201d Plaintiffs\u2019 asserted rights. Se-\ncured, Webster, American Dictionary of the English \nLanguage (1828). So, \u201crights provided for in spending \npower legislation\u201d are not \u201c\u2018secured\u2019 as against \nStates.\u201d Talevski, 599 U.S. at 192-93 (Gorsuch, J., con-\ncurring). \nYet even if spending legislation could be the basis \nfor a Section 1983 claim, the any-qualified-provider \nprovision does not meet this Court\u2019s high bar to create \na private right of action. When Congress intends to \ncreate a new right \u201cit must do so in clear and unam-\nbiguous terms.\u201d Gonzaga Univ. v. Doe, 563 U.S. 273, \n290 (2002). Because Congress has not spoken clearly \nhere, \nSection \n1983 \ncannot \nsupport \nPlanned \nParenthood\u2019s claims to a private right of action under \nthe Medicaid Act\u2019s any-qualified-provider provision.  \nFinally, allowing private enforcement of the Med-\nicaid Act\u2019s any-qualified-provider provision will im-\npose substantial costs on both states and the federal \ngovernment. The decision below\u2014if left to stand\u2014will \n\n4 \n \n \nopen the floodgates to costly litigation and breed un-\ncertainty in budgeting. And it will stifle the flexibility \nCongress gave states to innovate in their Medicaid \nprograms.  \nThe Court should grant the petition and reverse \nthe decision below.  \nARGUMENT \nI. \nThe Court should grant the petition be-\ncause Medicaid recipients do not have a \nprivately enforceable right under \u00a71983 \nbased on the Medicaid Act\u2019s any-qualified-\nprovider provision. \nSection 1983 provides a cause of action against \n\u201c[e]very person\u201d who deprives any other \u201cperson\u201d \u201cof \nany rights \u2026 secured by the Constitution and laws.\u201d \n42 U.S.C. \u00a71983. But Section 1983 cannot support \nPlanned Parenthood\u2019s claims. Spending Clause legis-\nlation like the Medicaid Act does not \u201csecure[]\u201d rights \nagainst States. Cf. Talevski, 599 U.S. at 192-93 (Gor-\nsuch, J., concurring). And the language of the Medi-\ncaid Act\u2019s any-qualified-provider provision does not \ncreate private rights. See Armstrong v. Exceptional \nChild Ctr., Inc., 575 U.S. 320, 331-32 (2015) (plural-\nity). \u201c[U]nless Congress \u2018speak[s] with a clear voice,\u2019 \nand manifests an \u2018unambiguous\u2019 intent to confer indi-\nvidual rights, federal funding provisions provide no \nbasis for private enforcement by \u00a71983.\u201d Gonzaga, 536 \nU.S. at 280. Thus the Court should grant the petition \nand reverse the decision below.  \n\n5 \n \n \nA. \nSpending Clause legislation does not \u201cse-\ncure[]\u201d rights against the state.  \nSection 1983 applies only to \u201crights \u2026 secured by \n\u2026 la[w].\u201d While Spending Clause legislation like the \nMedicaid Act is \u201cla[w]\u201d for the purposes of Section \n1983, Talevski, 599 U.S. at 180 (citing Maine v. Thi-\nboutot, 448 U.S. 1, 4 (1980)), such legislation does not \n\u201csecure[]\u201d an individual right to any qualified pro-\nvider, Talevski, 599 U.S. at 192-93 (Gorsuch, J., con-\ncurring) (reserving the question \u201cfor another day\u201d).  \nTo start, conditional spending laws\u2014like the Med-\nicaid Act\u2014do not \u201csecure\u201d rights. Such laws \u201cdo[] not \nfunction \u2026 like laws enacted under Congress\u2019 enumer-\nated legislative powers, such as the Commerce Clause. \nTalevski, 599 U.S. at 200 (Thomas, J., dissenting). Ra-\nther, spending clause legislation requires the consent \nand participation of states to confer benefits to private \nactors. The Spending Clause states that \u201cCongress \nshall have Power\u201d to \u201cprovide for the \u2026 general Wel-\nfare of the United States.\u201d U.S. Const. art. I, \u00a7 8, cl. 1. \nThis provision allows Congress to condition federal \nfunding for states upon compliance with certain con-\nditions. See South Dakota v. Dole, 483 U.S. 203, 206-\n07 (1987). But Congress cannot compel any state to \ncomply with its conditions; each state must \u201cvoluntar-\nily\u201d and \u201cknowingly\u201d accept the terms of Congress\u2019 of-\nfer. Nat\u2019l Fed\u2019n of Indep. Bus. v. Sebelius, 567 U.S. \n519, 577 (2012) (NFIB) (quoting Pennhurst State Sch. \n& Hosp. v. Halderman, 451 U.S. 1, 17 (1981)). Con-\ngress can \u201cuse its spending power to create incentives \nfor States to act in accordance with federal policies. \n\n6 \n \n \nBut when \u2018pressure turns into compulsion,\u2019 the legis-\nlation runs contrary to our system of federalism.\u201d \nNFIB, 567 U.S. at 577-78.  \nLike other conditional spending legislation, \u201cMed-\nicaid offers the States a bargain: Congress provides \nfederal funds in exchange for the States\u2019 agreement to \nspend them in accordance with congressionally im-\nposed conditions.\u201d Armstrong, 575 U.S. at 323. Under \nthis system of cooperative federalism, states create \nMedicaid plans and submit them to the Secretary of \nHealth and Human Services. In turn, the Secretary \ncan approve the state plans and distribute appropri-\nate funds. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a71396-1. Should a state fail to \n\u201csubstantially comply\u201d with the Medicaid Act\u2019s re-\nquirement in the plan\u2019s administration, the Secretary \nmay withhold funds until the state corrects course. \nSee 42 U.S.C. \u00a71396c. \nBecause the provisions of the Medicaid Act have \nforce only after a state has accepted Congress\u2019 terms, \nany rights or benefits under the Act are conditional. \nUnder such laws, any asserted rights would come into \nbeing (if ever) only if a state agrees to Medicaid\u2019s con-\nditions and the Secretary approves the state\u2019s plan. \nThe asserted rights could then go out of being if the \nstate later opts out of Medicaid or the Secretary ter-\nminates the state\u2019s participation. Thus the Act itself \ndoes not \u201c[e]ffectually guar[d]\u201d or \u201cma[k]e certain\u201d \nPlaintiffs\u2019 asserted rights. Secured, Webster, Ameri-\ncan Dictionary of the English Language (1828) (\u201cTo \nguard effectually from danger; to make safe \u2026 To \nmake certain\u201d). See also Secure, Johnson, A Dictionary \n\n7 \n \n \nof the English Language (4th ed. 1773) (\u201cTo make cer-\ntain; to put out of hazard; \u2026 To protect; to make safe\u201d); \nSecure, Webster, Revised Unabridged Dictionary \n(1913) (\u201c[T]o relieve from apprehensions of, or expo-\nsure to, danger \u2026 To put beyond the hazard of losing \nand not receiving; to make certain.\u201d). So, \u201crights pro-\nvided for in spending power legislation\u201d are not \u201c\u2018se-\ncured\u2019 as against States.\u201d Talevski, 599 U.S. at 192-93 \n(Gorsuch, J., concurring). \nIf spending legislation did function the same way \nas laws enacted under Congress\u2019s regulatory powers, \nit \u201cwould unconstitutionally commandeer the States \nto administer\u201d a whole host of federal programs \u201crang-\ning from welfare, to healthcare, to air quality, and \nmuch more.\u201d Talevski, 599 U.S. at 200-02 (Thomas, J., \ndissenting). A \u201cdefining characteristic\u201d of spending \nlegislation \u201cis the imposition of obligations on States \nthat accept federal funds.\u201d Id. at 202. Viewing a state\u2019s \nbreach of those obligations as \u201cakin to violating rights \nsecured by federal law\u201d is \u201cincompatible with th[e] \nCourt\u2019s anticommandeering doctrine.\u201d Id. Under that \n\u201cbedrock constitutional principle,\u201d \u201cCongress gener-\nally cannot directly regulate the States or require \nthem to implement federal programs.\u201d Id. \nAt bottom, Spending Clause legislation does not \n\u201csecure[]\u201d rights against the states. The any-qualified-\nprovider provision of the Medicaid Act thus cannot \nprovide the basis for Respondents\u2019 Section 1983 \nclaims.  \n \n \n\n8 \n \n \nB. \nIn any event, the Medicaid Act\u2019s any-quali-\nfied-provider provision does not unambigu-\nously create private rights.  \nEven if spending legislation could be the basis for \na Section 1983 claim, the any-qualified-provider pro-\nvision does not meet the \u201cdemanding bar\u201d this Court \nrequires to create a private right of action. Talevski, \n599 U.S. at 180. Last term, the Court clarified that \nGonzaga University v. Doe is the proper \u201cmethod for \nascertaining unambiguous conferral\u201d of private rights. \nId. at 183. And Gonzaga instructs that when Congress \nintends to create a new right \u201cit must do so in clear \nand unambiguous terms.\u201d Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at 290.  \nTo determine whether Congress \u201cunambiguous[ly] \ninten[ded] to confer individual rights,\u201d courts must \nlook to \u201cthe text and structure of\u201d the Act. Id. at 284 \nn.3, 286. The text must have \u201cexplicit \u2018right-or-duty-\ncreating language.\u2019\u201d Id. at 284 n.3. Importantly, \u201cit is \nrights, not the broader or vaguer \u2018benefits\u2019 or \u2018inter-\nests,\u2019 that may be enforced under\u201d Section 1983. Id. \nat 283. And this Court cannot \u201cimpute \u2026 an intent to \ncreate a private right.\u201d Id. at 284 n.3.  \nStatutes that merely place an obligation upon the \nstates (once they opt-in) to provide a benefit, absent \nclear rights language, fall short of creating a private \nenforcement right under Section 1983. Take Gonzaga \nitself. In that case, a Gonzaga University employee \ndisclosed the details of an alleged sexual misconduct \ninvestigation against a former student to an outside \nparty, and that student lost employment opportuni-\nties as a result. Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at 277. The student \n\n9 \n \n \nsued Gonzaga under Section 1983, alleging that the \nUniversity released his personal information to an \n\u201cunauthorized person\u201d in violation of the Family Edu-\ncational Rights and Privacy Act. Id. \nCongress \u201cenacted FERPA under its spending \npower to condition the receipt of federal funds on cer-\ntain requirements relating to the access and disclo-\nsure of student educational records.\u201d Id. at 278. The \nAct \u201cdirects the Secretary of Education to withhold \nfederal funds from any public or private \u2018educational \nagency or institution\u2019 that fails to comply with these \nconditions.\u201d Id. It states: \nNo funds shall be made available under any \napplicable program to any educational agency \nor institution which has a policy or practice of \npermitting the release of education records (or \npersonally identifiable information contained \ntherein ...) of students without the written \nconsent of their parents to any individual, \nagency, or organization.  \nId. at 279 (quoting 20 U.S.C. \u00a71232g(b)(1)). The stu-\ndent argued that this \u201cstatutory regime confers upon \nany student enrolled at a covered school or institution \na federal right, enforceable in suits for damages under \n\u00a71983, not to have \u2018education records\u2019 disclosed to un-\nauthorized persons without the student\u2019s express \nwritten consent.\u201d Id.  \nBut this Court held that \u201cspending legislation \ndrafted\u201d in those terms cannot \u201cconfer enforceable \nrights.\u201d Id. The Court noted the nondisclosure provi-\n\n10 \n \n \nsions \u201centirely lack the sort of \u2018rights-creating\u2019 lan-\nguage critical to showing the requisite congressional \nintent to create new rights.\u201d Id. at 287. And it ex-\nplained that those provisions \u201cspeak only to the Secre-\ntary of Education.\u201d Id. The Court concluded that there \nwas \u201cno question\u201d that the nondisclosure provisions \n\u201cfail to confer enforceable rights.\u201d Id. \nWhen this Court has determined that Congress in-\ntended a private right of action, the statutory lan-\nguage was much clearer. Examples of unambiguous \nrights include Title VI, \u201cNo person \u2026 shall \u2026 be sub-\njected to discrimination,\u201d id. at 284 n.3, 287, and pro-\nvisions that \u201cexpressly\u201d create \u201crights,\u201d Talevski, 599 \nU.S. at 184. In Health and Hospital Corporation of \nMarion County v. Talevski, a dementia patient\u2019s fam-\nily sued a nursing home for administering chemical \nrestraints and attempting to force his transfer to a dif-\nferent facility. Id. at 172-73. The Federal Nursing \nHome Reform Act provides that \u201cA nursing facility \nmust protect and promote the rights of each resident, \nincluding \u2026 The right to be from \u2026 any physical or \nchemical restraints.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a71396r(c)(1)(A)(ii). \nAnd under a section titled \u201cTransfer and Discharge \nRights\u201d the statute provides specific conditions which \nmust be met before a nursing home can forcibly dis-\ncharge a patient. U.S.C. \u00a71396r(c)(2)(A)-(B). Applying \nthe Gonzaga test, the Court held that these provisions \nwere enforceable under Section 1983 because they \nboth contained explicit rights language and have \u201can \nunmistakable focus on the benefited class\u201d as opposed \n\n11 \n \n \nto the conditions under which funds ought to be dis-\ntributed. Talevski, 599 U.S. at 183-86 (quoting Gon-\nzaga, 536 U.S. at 284). \nThe Medicaid Act\u2019s any-qualified-provider clause \nresembles the provision at issue in Gonzaga much \nmore than the provision in Talevski. That provision is \nstyled as follows: \u201cA state plan for medical assistance \nmust \u2026 provide \u2026\u201d \u00a71396a(a). It is not styled as a pro-\ntective prohibition. Nor does it \u201cexpressly\u201d confer \n\u201crights.\u201d Talevski, 599 U.S. at 184. And the mandatory \nlanguage\u2014\u201cmust provide\u201d\u2014is not enough to create \nrights. Armstrong, 575 U.S. at 323, 328-29. Section \n1396a tells \u201c[t]he Secretary\u201d what \u201cconditions\u201d state \nplans must \u201cfulfil[l]\u201d before he \u201cshall approve\u201d them. \n\u00a71396a(a), (b). A focus on the requirements for the Sec-\nretary\u2019s approval \u201cdoes not confer the sort of \u2018individ-\nual entitlement\u2019 that is enforceable under \u00a71983.\u201d \nGonzaga, 536 U.S. at 287. And given its placement un-\nder subsection (a), the any-qualified-provider provi-\nsion is \u201cphrased as a directive to the federal agency \ncharged with approving state Medicaid plans, not as a \nconferral of the right to sue upon the beneficiaries.\u201d \nArmstrong, 575 U.S. at 331 (plurality opinion). At the \nvery least, the provision\u2019s \u201ctext and structure\u201d create \nan ambiguity that defeats Planned Parenthood\u2019s \nclaims. Cf. Talevski, 599 U.S. at 193 (Barrett, J., con-\ncurring) (quoting Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at 283, 286). \n \n \n \n\n12 \n \n \nII.  The Court should grant the petition to limit \ncostly litigation, ensure predictability in \nbudgeting, and honor the flexibility Con-\ngress gave states to innovate. \nAllowing private enforcement of the Medicaid \nAct\u2019s any-qualified-provider provision will impose \nsubstantial costs on both states and the federal gov-\nernment. The decision below\u2014if left to stand\u2014will in-\ncrease costly litigation and breed uncertainty in budg-\neting. And it will stifle the flexibility Congress gave \nstates to innovate in their Medicaid programs.  \nMedicaid costs have become staggeringly high. \nThe total cost for the Medicaid program in 2020 was \n$824 billion dollars. Total Medicaid Spending, KFF \n(June 26, 2024), shorturl.at/pP4lk. And since Medi-\ncaid is jointly funded by the states, they bear substan-\ntial costs too. See Medicaid: An Overview, Cong. Re-\nsearch Serv. 18 (2019). On average, states spend 29% \nof their annual budgets on costs related to Medicaid. \nSee Medicaid Expenditures as a Percent of Total State \nExpenditures by Fund, KFF (June 26, 2024), \nshorturl.at/TpzFT. That makes Medicaid the costliest \nexpenditure for many state budgets, surpassing pri-\nmary and secondary education spending combined. \nNat\u2019l Ass\u2019n of State Budget Officers, State Expenditure \nReport (2023), shorturl.at/EU2gy. \nLitigation is a major factor driving up the costs of \nMedicaid. See, e.g., U.S. Dep\u2019t of Health & Hum. \nServs., Addressing the New Health Care Crisis: Re-\nforming the Medical Litigation System to Improve the \n\n13 \n \n \nQuality of Health Care (2003). Defending lawsuits of-\nten take years to resolve and can cost taxpayers mil-\nlions. See, e.g., Texas: A Cautionary Tale for Medicaid \nManagement and Managed Care Companies, Mintz \n(July 8, 2018) (discussing \u201c14-year old lawsuit\u201d over \nMedicaid reimbursement rates); Mary Jo Pitzl, 5 \nYears, $7 Million in Legal Fees and No End in Sight: \nFoster-Care Lawsuit Drags On,  AZ Central (Feb. 11, \n2020) (discussing \u201cfive-year legal battle\u201d that has \u201ccost \ntaxpayers more than $7 million\u201d); Kelli Kennedy, Flor-\nida Reaches Settlement in Kids\u2019 Medicaid Case, The \nLedger (Apr. 5, 2016) (discussing Florida\u2019s \u201cdecades[-\n]long class-action lawsuit,\u201d which cost the state \u201cwell \nover $7 million\u201d to defend). Even one unfavorable ju-\ndicial decision can impose budget-busting costs. Texas \nstate officials predicted one case would cost the state \n\u201canywhere from $1 billion to $5 billion.\u201d See, e.g., Rob-\nert T. Garrett, Medicaid Ruling May Hit Surplus: Up-\ngrading Kids\u2019 Care Could Carry $5B tab, The Dallas \nMorning News (Mar. 7, 2007). \nThese increased costs will stifle the flexibility \nCongress provided states to innovate in their Medi-\ncaid programs. Congress offered this flexibility so \nstates could \u201ctry new or different approaches to the \ndelivery of heath care services\u201d and \u201cadapt their pro-\ngrams to the special needs of particular geographic ar-\neas of groups of Medicaid enrollees.\u201d See Medicaid: An \nOverview, supra, at 18. Indeed, this flexibility allows \nfor \u201csubstantial variation\u201d among state programs in \n\u201cMedicaid eligibility, covered benefits, and provider \npayment rates.\u201d Id. If this Court opens the Medicaid \nAct to third party enforcement, it will force states to \n\n14 \n \n \nweigh the risk of those potential private-enforcement \nsuits when deciding whether to innovate. That under-\nmines Congress\u2019s desire for flexibility.  \nOn top of that, the current trajectory of the Med-\nicaid program is unsustainable. Even if Congress had \nintended to create an individual right through the \nMedicaid Act (which it did not), the \u201ceconomic reality\u201d \nof Medicaid shows that \u201cthe United States simply can-\nnot afford\u201d the attendant costs associated with a pri-\nvate right of action to enforce it. Mark A. Ison, Two \nWrongs Don\u2019t Make a Right: Medicaid, Section 1983 \nand the Two Wrongs Don't Make a Right: Medicaid, \nSection 1983 and the Cost of an Enforceable Right to \nHealth Care, 56 Vand. L. Rev. 1479, 1514 (2003). The \nlong-term \nsustainability \nof \nMedicaid \nrequires \nmeasures that will stem the exponential rise in the \ncost of the program\u2014not increase them. \nAnd in any event, it is Congress\u2014not the \ncourts\u2014who should decide whether a statute should \nbe enforced through private litigation. When courts \nusurp that power, they \u201cbypass[]\u201d the \u201clegislative pro-\ncess with its public scrutiny and participation\u201d and \nundermine \u201cthe normal play of political forces.\u201d Can-\nnon v. Univ. of Chi., 441 U.S. 677, 743 (1979) (Powell, \nJ., dissenting). And they deny states the opportunity \nto avoid \u201cpotentially unnecessary and disruptive liti-\ngation.\u201d Id. \nThe Court should grant the petition and reverse \nthe decision below.  \n \n\n15 \n \n \n \nCONCLUSION \nFor these reasons, the Court should grant the pe-\ntition and reverse the decision below.  \n \n \n \n           Respectfully submitted, \n \n           \n              July 5, 2024       \n \nThomas R.

Doe, 536 U.S. 273, 280 (2002). \nCongress knows how to create a private right of \naction, but it did not do so here. Amici therefore urge \nthis Court to reverse the decision below.  \n \n \n \n1 Pursuant to this Court\u2019s Rule 37.6, counsel for amici curiae \ncertifies that this brief was not authored in whole or in part by \ncounsel for any party and that no person or entity other than \namici curiae or its counsel has made a monetary contribution to \nthe preparation or submission of this brief.  \n\n2 \n \n \nINTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY  \nOF THE ARGUMENT \nIn 2018, South Carolina terminated Planned \nParenthood from the state\u2019s Medicaid program, de-\nclaring abortion clinics unqualified \u201cto provide ser-\nvices to Medicaid beneficiaries.\u201d App. 128a. The order \nstated that \u201cthe payment of taxpayer funds to abortion \nclinics, for any purpose, results in the subsidy of abor-\ntion and the denial of the right to life.\u201d App.158a. And \nit explained that \u201cabortion clinics\u2019 primary focus on \ndenying the right to life is contrary to and conflicts \nwith the State\u2019s obligation to protect and preserve that \nright.\u201d Id. Indeed, South Carolina state law prohibits \nthe use of funds to pay for abortions. See S.C. Code \nAnn. \u00a743-5-1185 (1976).  \nTwo weeks after its termination from the pro-\ngram, Planned Parenthood South Atlantic and one of \nits Medicaid patients, Julie Edwards, sued South Car-\nolina in federal court. They argued that by terminat-\ning Planned Parenthood from the Medicaid program, \nSouth Carolina had violated patients\u2019 right to the \n\u201cqualified provider of their choosing\u201d under the Medi-\ncaid Act. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a71396a(a)(23). The district \ncourt granted Edwards a preliminary injunction. App. \n127a, 146a. On appeal, the Fourth Circuit affirmed, \nholding that Congress unambiguously intended \u201cto \ncreate an individual right enforceable under \u00a71983 in \nthe free-choice-of-provider provision.\u201d App. 83a.   \nThat decision is wrong. \u201c[C]onditional spending \nlegislation\u201d like the Medicaid Act \u201cdoes not function\u2014\nand, in particular, does not \u2018secure rights\u2019\u2014like laws \n\n3 \n \n \nenacted under Congress\u2019 enumerated legislative pow-\ners.\u201d Health & Hosp. Corp. of Marion Cnty. v. Talevski, \n599 U.S. 166, 200 (2023) (Thomas, J., dissenting). Be-\ncause spending legislation requires the consent and \nparticipation of states, any asserted rights come into \nbeing (if ever) only if a state agrees to Medicaid\u2019s con-\nditions and the Secretary approves the state\u2019s plan. \nThose asserted rights could then go out of being if the \nstate later opts out of Medicaid or the Secretary ter-\nminates the state\u2019s participation. Thus the Act itself \ndoes not \u201c[e]ffectually guar[d]\u201d or \u201cma[k]e certain\u201d \nPlaintiffs\u2019 asserted rights. Secured, Webster, Ameri-\ncan Dictionary of the English Language (1828). So, \n\u201crights provided for in spending power legislation\u201d are \nnot \u201c\u2018secured\u2019 as against States.\u201d Talevski, 599 U.S. at \n192-93 (Gorsuch, J., concurring). \nYet even if spending legislation could be the basis \nfor a Section 1983 claim, the any-qualified-provider \nprovision does not meet this Court\u2019s high bar to create \na private right of action. When Congress intends to \ncreate a new right \u201cit must do so in clear and unam-\nbiguous terms.\u201d Gonzaga Univ. v. Doe, 563 U.S. 273, \n290 (2002). Because Congress has not spoken clearly \nhere, \nSection \n1983 \ncannot \nsupport \nPlanned \nParenthood\u2019s claims to a private right of action under \nthe Medicaid Act\u2019s any-qualified-provider provision.  \nFinally, allowing private enforcement of the Med-\nicaid Act\u2019s any-qualified-provider provision will im-\npose substantial costs on both states and the federal \ngovernment. The decision below\u2014if left to stand\u2014will \nopen the floodgates to costly litigation and breed un-\ncertainty in budgeting. And it will stifle the flexibility \n\n4 \n \n \nCongress gave states to innovate in their Medicaid \nprograms.  \nThe Court should reverse the decision below.  \nARGUMENT \nI. \nMedicaid recipients do not have a privately \nenforceable right under \u00a71983 based on the \nMedicaid Act\u2019s any-qualified-provider pro-\nvision. \nSection 1983 provides a cause of action against \n\u201c[e]very person\u201d who deprives any other \u201cperson\u201d \u201cof \nany rights \u2026 secured by the Constitution and laws.\u201d \n42 U.S.C. \u00a71983. But Section 1983 cannot support \nPlanned Parenthood\u2019s claims. Spending Clause legis-\nlation like the Medicaid Act does not \u201csecure[]\u201d rights \nagainst States. Cf. Talevski, 599 U.S. at 192-93 (Gor-\nsuch, J., concurring). And the language of the Medi-\ncaid Act\u2019s any-qualified-provider provision does not \ncreate private rights. See Armstrong v. Exceptional \nChild Ctr., Inc., 575 U.S. 320, 331-32 (2015) (plural-\nity). \u201c[U]nless Congress \u2018speak[s] with a clear voice,\u2019 \nand manifests an \u2018unambiguous\u2019 intent to confer indi-\nvidual rights, federal funding provisions provide no \nbasis for private enforcement by \u00a71983.\u201d Gonzaga, 536 \nU.S. at 280. Thus the Court should reverse the deci-\nsion below.  \n \n \n \n\n5 \n \n \nA. \nSpending Clause legislation does not \u201cse-\ncure[]\u201d rights against the state.  \nSection 1983 applies only to \u201crights \u2026 secured by \n\u2026 la[w].\u201d While Spending Clause legislation like the \nMedicaid Act is \u201cla[w]\u201d for the purposes of Section \n1983, Talevski, 599 U.S. at 180 (citing Maine v. Thi-\nboutot, 448 U.S. 1, 4 (1980)), such legislation does not \n\u201csecure[]\u201d an individual right to any qualified pro-\nvider, Talevski, 599 U.S. at 192-93 (Gorsuch, J., con-\ncurring) (reserving the question \u201cfor another day\u201d).  \nTo start, conditional spending laws\u2014like the Med-\nicaid Act\u2014do not \u201csecure\u201d rights. Such laws \u201cdo[] not \nfunction \u2026 like laws enacted under Congress\u2019 enumer-\nated legislative powers, such as the Commerce \nClause.\u201d Talevski, 599 U.S. at 200 (Thomas, J., dis-\nsenting). Rather, spending clause legislation requires \nthe consent and participation of states to confer bene-\nfits to private actors. The Spending Clause states that \n\u201cCongress shall have Power\u201d to \u201cprovide for the \u2026 gen-\neral Welfare of the United States.\u201d U.S. Const. art. I, \n\u00a7 8, cl. 1. This provision allows Congress to condition \nfederal funding for states upon compliance with cer-\ntain conditions. See South Dakota v. Dole, 483 U.S. \n203, 206-07 (1987). But Congress cannot compel any \nstate to comply with its conditions; each state must \n\u201cvoluntarily\u201d and \u201cknowingly\u201d accept the terms of Con-\ngress\u2019 offer. Nat\u2019l Fed\u2019n of Indep. Bus. v. Sebelius, 567 \nU.S. 519, 577 (2012) (NFIB) (quoting Pennhurst State \nSch. & Hosp. v. Halderman, 451 U.S. 1, 17 (1981)). \nCongress can \u201cuse its spending power to create incen-\ntives for States to act in accordance with federal poli-\ncies. But when \u2018pressure turns into compulsion,\u2019 the \n\n6 \n \n \nlegislation runs contrary to our system of federalism.\u201d \nNFIB, 567 U.S. at 577-78.  \nLike other conditional spending legislation, \u201cMed-\nicaid offers the States a bargain: Congress provides \nfederal funds in exchange for the States\u2019 agreement to \nspend them in accordance with congressionally im-\nposed conditions.\u201d Armstrong, 575 U.S. at 323. Under \nthis system of cooperative federalism, states create \nMedicaid plans and submit them to the Secretary of \nHealth and Human Services. In turn, the Secretary \ncan approve the state plans and distribute appropri-\nate funds. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a71396-1. Should a state fail to \n\u201csubstantially comply\u201d with the Medicaid Act\u2019s re-\nquirement in the plan\u2019s administration, the Secretary \nmay withhold funds until the state corrects course. \nSee 42 U.S.C. \u00a71396c. \nBecause the provisions of the Medicaid Act have \nforce only after a state has accepted Congress\u2019 terms, \nany rights or benefits under the Act are conditional. \nUnder such laws, any asserted rights would come into \nbeing (if ever) only if a state agrees to Medicaid\u2019s con-\nditions and the Secretary approves the state\u2019s plan. \nThe asserted rights could then go out of being if the \nstate later opts out of Medicaid or the Secretary ter-\nminates the state\u2019s participation. Thus the Act itself \ndoes not \u201c[e]ffectually guar[d]\u201d or \u201cma[k]e certain\u201d \nPlaintiffs\u2019 asserted rights. Secured, Webster, Ameri-\ncan Dictionary of the English Language (1828) (\u201cTo \nguard effectually from danger; to make safe \u2026 To \nmake certain\u201d). See also Secure, Johnson, A Dictionary \nof the English Language (4th ed. 1773) (\u201cTo make cer-\ntain; to put out of hazard; \u2026 To protect; to make safe\u201d); \n\n7 \n \n \nSecure, Webster, Revised Unabridged Dictionary \n(1913) (\u201c[T]o relieve from apprehensions of, or expo-\nsure to, danger \u2026 To put beyond the hazard of losing \nand not receiving; to make certain.\u201d). So, \u201crights pro-\nvided for in spending power legislation\u201d are not \u201c\u2018se-\ncured\u2019 as against States.\u201d Talevski, 599 U.S. at 192-93 \n(Gorsuch, J., concurring). \nIf spending legislation did function the same way \nas laws enacted under Congress\u2019s regulatory powers, \nit \u201cwould unconstitutionally commandeer the States \nto administer\u201d a whole host of federal programs \u201crang-\ning from welfare, to healthcare, to air quality, and \nmuch more.\u201d Talevski, 599 U.S. at 200-02 (Thomas, J., \ndissenting). A \u201cdefining characteristic\u201d of spending \nlegislation \u201cis the imposition of obligations on States \nthat accept federal funds.\u201d Id. at 202. Viewing a state\u2019s \nbreach of those obligations as \u201cakin to violating rights \nsecured by federal law\u201d is \u201cincompatible with th[e] \nCourt\u2019s anticommandeering doctrine.\u201d Id. Under that \n\u201cbedrock constitutional principle,\u201d \u201cCongress gener-\nally cannot directly regulate the States or require \nthem to implement federal programs.\u201d Id. \nAt bottom, Spending Clause legislation does not \n\u201csecure[]\u201d rights against the states. The any-qualified-\nprovider provision of the Medicaid Act thus cannot \nprovide the basis for Respondents\u2019 Section 1983 \nclaims.  \n \n \n\n8 \n \n \nB. \nIn any event, the Medicaid Act\u2019s any-quali-\nfied-provider provision does not unambigu-\nously create private rights.  \nEven if spending legislation could be the basis for \na Section 1983 claim, the any-qualified-provider pro-\nvision does not meet the \u201cdemanding bar\u201d this Court \nrequires to create a private right of action. Talevski, \n599 U.S. at 180. Two years ago, the Court clarified \nthat Gonzaga University v. Doe is the proper \u201cmethod \nfor ascertaining unambiguous conferral\u201d of private \nrights. Id. at 183. And Gonzaga instructs that when \nCongress intends to create a new right \u201cit must do so \nin clear and unambiguous terms.\u201d Gonzaga, 536 U.S. \nat 290.  \nTo determine whether Congress \u201cunambiguous[ly] \ninten[ded] to confer individual rights,\u201d courts must \nlook to \u201cthe text and structure of\u201d the Act. Id. at 284 \nn.3, 286. The text must have \u201cexplicit \u2018right-or-duty-\ncreating language.\u2019\u201d Id. at 284 n.3. Importantly, \u201cit is \nrights, not the broader or vaguer \u2018benefits\u2019 or \u2018inter-\nests,\u2019 that may be enforced under\u201d Section 1983. Id. \nat 283. And this Court cannot \u201cimpute \u2026 an intent to \ncreate a private right.\u201d Id. at 284 n.3.  \nStatutes that merely place an obligation upon the \nstates (once they opt-in) to provide a benefit, absent \nclear rights language, fall short of creating a private \nenforcement right under Section 1983. Take Gonzaga \nitself. In that case, a Gonzaga University employee \ndisclosed the details of an alleged sexual misconduct \ninvestigation against a former student to an outside \n\n9 \n \n \nparty, and that student lost employment opportuni-\nties as a result. Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at 277. The student \nsued Gonzaga under Section 1983, alleging that the \nUniversity released his personal information to an \n\u201cunauthorized person\u201d in violation of the Family Edu-\ncational Rights and Privacy Act. Id. \nCongress \u201cenacted FERPA under its spending \npower to condition the receipt of federal funds on cer-\ntain requirements relating to the access and disclo-\nsure of student educational records.\u201d Id. at 278. The \nAct \u201cdirects the Secretary of Education to withhold \nfederal funds from any public or private \u2018educational \nagency or institution\u2019 that fails to comply with these \nconditions.\u201d Id. It states: \nNo funds shall be made available under any \napplicable program to any educational agency \nor institution which has a policy or practice of \npermitting the release of education records (or \npersonally identifiable information contained \ntherein ...) of students without the written \nconsent of their parents to any individual, \nagency, or organization.  \nId. at 279 (quoting 20 U.S.C. \u00a71232g(b)(1)). The stu-\ndent argued that this \u201cstatutory regime confers upon \nany student enrolled at a covered school or institution \na federal right, enforceable in suits for damages under \n\u00a71983, not to have \u2018education records\u2019 disclosed to un-\nauthorized persons without the student\u2019s express \nwritten consent.\u201d Id.  \nBut this Court held that \u201cspending legislation \ndrafted\u201d in those terms cannot \u201cconfer enforceable \n\n10 \n \n \nrights.\u201d Id. The Court noted the nondisclosure provi-\nsions \u201centirely lack the sort of \u2018rights-creating\u2019 lan-\nguage critical to showing the requisite congressional \nintent to create new rights.\u201d Id. at 287. And it ex-\nplained that those provisions \u201cspeak only to the Secre-\ntary of Education.\u201d Id. The Court concluded that there \nwas \u201cno question\u201d that the nondisclosure provisions \n\u201cfail to confer enforceable rights.\u201d Id. \nWhen this Court has determined that Congress in-\ntended a private right of action, the statutory lan-\nguage was much clearer. Examples of unambiguous \nrights include \u201cindividually focused terminology\u201d like \nTitle VI\u2019s command that \u201cNo person \u2026 shall \u2026 be sub-\njected to discrimination,\u201d id. at 284 n.3, 287, and pro-\nvisions that \u201cexpressly\u201d create \u201crights,\u201d Talevski, 599 \nU.S. at 184. In Health and Hospital Corporation of \nMarion County v. Talevski, a dementia patient\u2019s fam-\nily sued a nursing home for administering chemical \nrestraints and attempting to force his transfer to a dif-\nferent facility. Id. at 172-73. The Federal Nursing \nHome Reform Act provides that \u201cA nursing facility \nmust protect and promote the rights of each resident, \nincluding \u2026 The right to be from \u2026 any physical or \nchemical restraints.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a71396r(c)(1)(A)(ii). \nAnd under a section titled \u201cTransfer and Discharge \nRights\u201d the statute provides specific conditions which \nmust be met before a nursing home can forcibly dis-\ncharge a patient. 42 U.S.C. \u00a71396r(c)(2)(A)-(B). Apply-\ning the Gonzaga test, the Court held that these provi-\nsions were enforceable under Section 1983 because \nthey both contained explicit rights language and have \n\n11 \n \n \n\u201can unmistakable focus on the benefited class\u201d as op-\nposed to the conditions under which funds ought to be \ndistributed. Talevski, 599 U.S. at 183-86 (quoting \nGonzaga, 536 U.S. at 284). \nThe Medicaid Act\u2019s any-qualified-provider clause \nresembles the provision at issue in Gonzaga much \nmore than the provision in Talevski. That provision is \nstyled as follows: \u201cA state plan for medical assistance \nmust \u2026 provide \u2026\u201d \u00a71396a(a). It is not styled as a pro-\ntective prohibition. Nor does it \u201cexpressly\u201d confer \n\u201crights.\u201d Talevski, 599 U.S. at 184. And the mandatory \nlanguage\u2014\u201cmust provide\u201d\u2014is not enough to create \nrights. Armstrong, 575 U.S. at 323, 328-29. Section \n1396a tells \u201c[t]he Secretary\u201d what \u201cconditions\u201d state \nplans must \u201cfulfil[l]\u201d before he \u201cshall approve\u201d them. \n\u00a71396a(a), (b). A focus on the requirements for the Sec-\nretary\u2019s approval \u201cdoes not confer the sort of \u2018individ-\nual entitlement\u2019 that is enforceable under \u00a71983.\u201d \nGonzaga, 536 U.S. at 287. And given its placement un-\nder subsection (a), the any-qualified-provider provi-\nsion is \u201cphrased as a directive to the federal agency \ncharged with approving state Medicaid plans, not as a \nconferral of the right to sue upon the beneficiaries.\u201d \nArmstrong, 575 U.S. at 331 (plurality opinion). At the \nvery least, the provision\u2019s \u201ctext and structure\u201d create \nan ambiguity that defeats Planned Parenthood\u2019s \nclaims. Cf. Talevski, 599 U.S. at 193 (Barrett, J., con-\ncurring) (quoting Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at 283, 286). \n \n \n \n\n12 \n \n \nII.  Reversing the decision below will limit \ncostly litigation, ensure predictability in \nbudgeting, and honor the flexibility Con-\ngress gave states to innovate. \nAllowing private enforcement of the Medicaid \nAct\u2019s any-qualified-provider provision will impose \nsubstantial costs on both states and the federal gov-\nernment. The decision below\u2014if left to stand\u2014will in-\ncrease costly litigation and breed uncertainty in budg-\neting. And it will stifle the flexibility Congress gave \nstates to innovate in their Medicaid programs.  \nMedicaid costs have become staggeringly high. \nThe total cost for the Medicaid program in 2020 was \n$824 billion dollars. Total Medicaid Spending, KFF \n(June 26, 2024), shorturl.at/pP4lk. And since Medi-\ncaid is jointly funded by the states, they bear substan-\ntial costs too. See Medicaid: An Overview, Cong. Re-\nsearch Serv. 18 (2019). On average, states spend 29% \nof their annual budgets on costs related to Medicaid. \nSee Medicaid Expenditures as a Percent of Total State \nExpenditures by Fund, KFF (June 26, 2024), \nshorturl.at/TpzFT. That makes Medicaid the costliest \nexpenditure for many state budgets, surpassing pri-\nmary and secondary education spending combined. \nNat\u2019l Ass\u2019n of State Budget Officers, State Expenditure \nReport (2023), shorturl.at/EU2gy. \nLitigation is a major factor driving up the costs of \nMedicaid. See, e.g., U.S. Dep\u2019t of Health & Hum. \nServs., Addressing the New Health Care Crisis: Re-\nforming the Medical Litigation System to Improve the \n\n13 \n \n \nQuality of Health Care (2003). Defending lawsuits of-\nten take years to resolve and can cost taxpayers mil-\nlions. See, e.g., Texas: A Cautionary Tale for Medicaid \nManagement and Managed Care Companies, Mintz \n(July 8, 2018) (discussing \u201c14-year old lawsuit\u201d over \nMedicaid reimbursement rates); Mary Jo Pitzl, 5 \nYears, $7 Million in Legal Fees and No End in Sight: \nFoster-Care Lawsuit Drags On,  AZ Central (Feb. 11, \n2020) (discussing \u201cfive-year legal battle\u201d that has \u201ccost \ntaxpayers more than $7 million\u201d); Kelli Kennedy, Flor-\nida Reaches Settlement in Kids\u2019 Medicaid Case, The \nLedger (Apr. 5, 2016) (discussing Florida\u2019s \u201cdecades[-\n]long class-action lawsuit,\u201d which cost the state \u201cwell \nover $7 million\u201d to defend). Even one unfavorable ju-\ndicial decision can impose budget-busting costs. Texas \nstate officials predicted one case would cost the state \n\u201canywhere from $1 billion to $5 billion.\u201d See, e.g., Rob-\nert T. Garrett, Medicaid Ruling May Hit Surplus: Up-\ngrading Kids\u2019 Care Could Carry $5B tab, The Dallas \nMorning News (Mar. 7, 2007). \nThese increased costs will stifle the flexibility \nCongress provided states to innovate in their Medi-\ncaid programs. Congress offered this flexibility so \nstates could \u201ctry new or different approaches to the \ndelivery of health care services\u201d and \u201cadapt their pro-\ngrams to the special needs of particular geographic ar-\neas of groups of Medicaid enrollees.\u201d See Medicaid: An \nOverview, supra, at 18. Indeed, this flexibility allows \nfor \u201csubstantial variation\u201d among state programs in \n\u201cMedicaid eligibility, covered benefits, and provider \npayment rates.\u201d Id. If this Court opens the Medicaid \nAct to third party enforcement, it will force states to \n\n14 \n \n \nweigh the risk of those potential private-enforcement \nsuits when deciding whether to innovate. That under-\nmines Congress\u2019s desire for flexibility.  \nOn top of that, the current trajectory of the Medi-\ncaid program is unsustainable. Even if Congress had \nintended to create an individual right through the \nMedicaid Act (which it did not), the \u201ceconomic reality\u201d \nof Medicaid shows that \u201cthe United States simply can-\nnot afford\u201d the attendant costs associated with a pri-\nvate right of action to enforce it. Mark A. Ison, Two \nWrongs Don\u2019t Make a Right: Medicaid, Section 1983 \nand the Two Wrongs Don\u2019t Make a Right: Medicaid, \nSection 1983 and the Cost of an Enforceable Right to \nHealth Care, 56 Vand. L. Rev. 1479, 1514 (2003). The \nlong-term \nsustainability \nof \nMedicaid \nrequires \nmeasures that will stem the exponential rise in the \ncost of the program\u2014not increase them. \nAnd in any event, it is Congress\u2014not the courts\u2014\nwho should decide whether a statute should be en-\nforced through private litigation. When courts usurp \nthat power, they \u201cbypass[]\u201d the \u201clegislative process \nwith its public scrutiny and participation\u201d and under-\nmine \u201cthe normal play of political forces.\u201d Cannon v. \nUniv. of Chi., 441 U.S. 677, 743 (1979) (Powell, J., dis-\nsenting). And they deny states the opportunity to \navoid \u201cpotentially unnecessary and disruptive litiga-\ntion.\u201d Id. \nThe Court should reverse the decision below.  \n \n \n\n15 \n \n \nCONCLUSION \nFor these reasons, the Court should reverse the \ndecision below.  \n \n \n \n           Respectfully submitted, \n \n           \n              February 10, 2025       \n \nThomas R.

          "task_beliefs": "My beliefs regarding this specific case have been substantially updated. While my previous action sought the respondent's brief on the merits, it returned the \"Brief in Opposition\" (BIO) to the petition for a writ of certiorari. This document, while not the final merits argument, provides the first direct evidence of the respondent's legal strategy, allowing me to move from a lopsided understanding to a more balanced, albeit still incomplete, view of the legal battlefield.\n\nMy cumulative understanding is as follows:\n1.  **Core Legal Question:** The central issue remains whether the Medicaid Act\u2019s \u201cany qualified provider\u201d provision (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a(a)(23)(A)) unambiguously creates a private right of action for beneficiaries to sue under \u00a7 1983.\n2.  **Petitioner's Argumentative Framework:** My understanding of South Carolina's case, built on the *Gonzaga*/*Talevski* \"demanding bar,\" remains stable. They focus on the lack of the word \"right\" in the statute and its structural placement as a mere plan requirement, contrasting it with the FNHRA statute in *Talevski*.\n3.  **Textual and Structural Attack (Petitioner):** The petitioner's primary strategy is to argue that \u00a7 1396a(a)(23)(A) fails the *Talevski* test due to its text (\"must provide that... may obtain\") and structure (one of 87 requirements in a \"Contents\" section).\n4.  **Precedent Strategy (Petitioner):** South Carolina argues that the stricter *Gonzaga*/*Talevski* framework has effectively superseded older, more lenient tests from cases like *Wilder* and *Wright*.\n5.  **Alternative Remedies Argument (Petitioner):** The petitioner continues to point to the Secretary of HHS's authority to withhold funds and state-level administrative processes as the congressionally intended remedies, not private lawsuits.\n6.  **NEW - Respondent's Counter-Strategy (Preview from BIO):** The Brief in Opposition provides a clear preview of Planned Parenthood's core arguments. They are not attempting to sidestep recent precedent but are meeting it head-on.\n    *   **Embracing *Talevski*:** The respondent's central claim is that the Fourth Circuit \"faithfully apply[ed]\" *Talevski* and correctly found an enforceable right. They will argue the free-choice-of-provider provision *passes* the *Talevski* test.\n    *   **\"Rights-Creating\" Language Counterargument:** The respondent directly counters the petitioner's textual argument by focusing on the phrase \"any individual eligible... may obtain such assistance.\" They frame this as having an \"'unmistakable focus on the benefited class'\" and being \"'phrased in terms of the persons benefited,'\" quoting directly from *Gonzaga* and *Talevski*. This signals their belief that the *focus* of the language, not the specific word \"right,\" is what matters.\n    *   **The \"Qualified\" Provider Frame:** A key narrative element for the respondent is that South Carolina has conceded that Planned Parenthood is \"perfectly competent\" and \"qualified\" to provide the relevant medical services. They frame the state's action as an attempt to terminate a provider for reasons entirely outside the Medicaid Act (its status as an abortion provider), which they will argue is precisely the kind of state interference the free-choice provision was designed to prevent.\n7.  **Updated State of Uncertainty:** My understanding is no longer completely one-sided. I now have the foundational arguments for the respondent. However, this observation was of a cert-stage brief, not a merits brief. The primary uncertainty has now been refined: I know the respondent's themes, but I do not yet know how they will specifically rebut the petitioner's detailed structural argument (i.e., the provision being just one of 87 requirements) or how they will fully develop their own textual analysis in the more comprehensive merits brief. My next highest-value action remains finding the respondent's *brief on the merits*.",
          "design_beliefs": "This observation was highly instructive, particularly because the result of my action was not what I intended. This \"failed\" search provided a valuable lesson in source differentiation and the structure of Supreme Court litigation, leading to a significant refinement of my meta-level strategies.\n\nMy cumulative design beliefs are:\n1.  **Validation of the \"Petitioner-First\" Heuristic:** This strategy remains effective. Having a deep map of the petitioner's merits brief provides the essential context for understanding the significance of the respondent's counter-arguments.\n2.  **Confirmation of \"The *Talevski* Litmus Test\":** This observation powerfully confirms this heuristic. The BIO shows that the respondent is not avoiding *Talevski* but is instead arguing that the provision in question *satisfies* the *Talevski* standard. The entire case is being litigated through the lens of this precedent.\n3.  **Confirmation of \"Precedent Bracketing\":** The BIO confirms that the petitioner is indeed using this strategy by trying to sideline *Wilder* and *Blessing*. The respondent's counter-strategy appears to be to argue that *Talevski* simply clarified the *Gonzaga* test, which their provision meets, thereby neutralizing the petitioner's bracketing attempt.\n4.  **Refined Source Prioritization & Nuance:** My previous belief in prioritizing primary documents is now more nuanced. I have learned to differentiate between **cert-stage briefs** (Petition, Brief in Opposition) and **merits-stage briefs**. While merits briefs are the gold standard for final prediction, a Brief in Opposition is an extremely high-value secondary source. It provides an information-dense preview of the respondent's core arguments, making it the best alternative when a merits brief is not yet available.\n5.  **Validation of \"Consolidate and Plan\":** The previous step of pausing to consolidate my beliefs and identify the key uncertainty (the respondent's argument) was highly effective. It led to a targeted action that, despite its imperfect result, substantially reduced my primary uncertainty. This validates the deliberate, iterative nature of the DBOED process.\n6.  **NEW Heuristic: \"The Cert-Stage Preview\":** When a respondent's merits brief is unavailable, actively seeking the Brief in Opposition (BIO) is an effective strategy. It serves as a blueprint of the respondent's case, allowing for a rapid balancing of a previously one-sided understanding and a more refined formulation of remaining uncertainties.\n7.  **NEW Process Refinement: \"Action Query and Result Scrutiny\":** This observation taught me a crucial lesson about the interaction between my query and the search environment. My query for \"respondent's brief on the merits\" returned a \"brief in opposition.\" This highlights the need for: a) more precise search queries (e.g., explicitly including \"on the merits\" or filtering out \"in opposition\"), and b) carefully scrutinizing the titles and metadata of search results to ensure they match the intended document type. This prevents misinterpretation and ensures the belief update is based on a correct understanding of the source's context and purpose."

          "task_beliefs": "My understanding of the legal arguments in this case has been further deepened and, paradoxically, made more lopsided by this observation. My targeted search for the respondent's merits brief failed, instead returning a highly informative amicus brief from members of Congress in support of the petitioner. This strengthens my grasp of the petitioner's position while leaving the respondent's counter-arguments as my primary uncertainty.\n\nMy cumulative understanding is now:\n1.  **Core Legal Question:** The central issue remains whether the Medicaid Act\u2019s \u201cany qualified provider\u201d provision (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a(a)(23)(A)) unambiguously creates a private right of action for beneficiaries to sue a state under \u00a7 1983.\n2.  **Petitioner's Argumentative Framework:** My understanding of South Carolina's case, built on the *Gonzaga*/*Talevski* \"demanding bar,\" is now significantly reinforced and expanded.\n    *   **Textual and Structural Attack (Reinforced):** The amicus brief strongly echoes the petitioner's argument that the provision fails the *Talevski* test. It emphasizes that the language (\"A state plan... must... provide...\") is a directive to the state and the federal agency, lacking the \"unmistakable focus on the benefited class\" and explicit \"rights-creating\" language found in the FNHRA statute at issue in *Talevski*.\n    *   **Precedent Strategy (Stable):** The strategy of using *Gonzaga*/*Talevski* to sideline older, more lenient precedents remains a core component of the petitioner's case.\n    *   **Alternative Remedies Argument (Stable):** The argument that the sole remedy is the Secretary of HHS withholding funds remains a key structural point for the petitioner.\n    *   **NEW - Foundational Spending Clause Attack:** The amicus brief introduces a more fundamental and potent argument: that Spending Clause legislation, by its nature, does not \"secure[]\" rights in the way \u00a7 1983 requires. The argument, drawing on concurrences and dissents in *Talevski*, posits that because a state's participation is a voluntary, contractual arrangement, the conditions are not \"secured\" against the state in the same way as a direct federal mandate under a power like the Commerce Clause. This provides the petitioner's side with a broader, more ideological path to victory that could potentially limit \u00a7 1983 enforcement for all Spending Clause statutes, not just this one.\n    *   **NEW - Policy & \"Floodgates\" Argument:** The amici forcefully argue that allowing private lawsuits will impose massive costs on states, create budget uncertainty, and stifle the innovation that Medicaid's \"cooperative federalism\" model is meant to encourage. This frames the case not just as a technical legal question but as a major issue of federalism and fiscal policy, an argument likely to resonate with the Court's more conservative members.\n3.  **Respondent's Counter-Strategy (Preview from BIO):** My knowledge of the respondent's case is unchanged and still based on the cert-stage Brief in Opposition.\n    *   Their core strategy is to argue that the free-choice-of-provider provision *passes* the *Talevski* test by focusing on the phrase \"any individual eligible... may obtain such assistance\" as evidence of an \"unmistakable focus on the benefited class.\"\n    *   They will frame the state's action as an attempt to disqualify a provider for reasons extraneous to the Medicaid Act (i.e., abortion), which is the exact harm the provision was designed to prevent.\n4.  **Updated State of Uncertainty:** My primary uncertainty remains the same, but it is now more acute. I still lack the respondent's full brief on the merits. This latest observation has heavily weighted my understanding toward the petitioner. I now have a multi-layered view of their case: a primary textual/structural argument under *Talevski*, a foundational constitutional argument about the Spending Clause, and a powerful policy argument about costs and federalism. The critical question is how the respondents will rebut all three of these attacks in their full merits brief. My next action must, with even greater urgency, be to locate that specific document.",
          "design_beliefs": "This observation, resulting from another \"failed\" search, has been extremely valuable for refining my meta-level strategies. The pattern of receiving useful but unintended information from targeted queries is a significant lesson.\n\nMy cumulative design beliefs are:\n1.  **Validation of the \"Petitioner-First\" Heuristic:** This remains a robust strategy. Mapping the petitioner's case and its supporting amicus arguments provides the necessary framework to understand the entire legal battle.\n2.  **Confirmation of \"The *Talevski* Litmus Test\":** This heuristic is strongly confirmed. The entire legal analysis from all sides (petitioner, respondent's BIO, and now petitioner's amici) is filtered through the *Gonzaga*/*Talevski* framework.\n3.  **Confirmation of \"Precedent Bracketing\":** The strategy of using recent, stricter precedent to marginalize older, more lenient precedent is a clear feature of the petitioner's case.\n4.  **Refined Source Prioritization & Nuance:** My hierarchy of sources is becoming more sophisticated. I have learned to differentiate between cert-stage and merits-stage documents and now recognize the unique value of amicus briefs. My updated prioritization is:\n    1.  Merits Briefs (Petitioner and Respondent)\n    2.  Key Amicus Briefs (from influential groups like Congress, the Solicitor General, or blocs of states)\n    3.  Oral Argument Transcript\n    4.  Respondent's Brief in Opposition (as a high-quality preview)\n    5.  Petition for a Writ of Certiorari\n5.  **Validation of \"Consolidate and Plan\":** The DBOED cycle of consolidating beliefs, identifying the primary uncertainty (the respondent's argument), and taking targeted action proved effective. Even though the action failed in its primary goal, it provided valuable secondary information and confirmed that the identified uncertainty remains the top priority.\n6.  **\"The Cert-Stage Preview\" Heuristic:** This remains a valuable strategy for when a merits brief is unavailable.\n7.  **Refined \"Action Query and Result Scrutiny\":** This is the most important lesson from the last two observations. My query for the respondent's brief returned an amicus brief for the petitioner. This demonstrates that I must not only formulate precise queries but also meticulously scrutinize the metadata of the results (e.g., the full title, author, and filing date) to confirm a document's identity and purpose *before* analyzing its contents. This prevents misattributing arguments and ensures belief updates are based on an accurate understanding of the source.\n8.  **NEW Heuristic: \"The Amicus Signal.\"** This observation teaches that amicus briefs from significant institutional actors (like members of Congress) are not merely additive; they are important signals. They can reveal the broader ideological and policy stakes of a case and introduce or amplify arguments the primary parties may not center. Actively seeking out such briefs is a valuable strategy for building a complete picture of the influences on the Court.\n9.  **NEW Heuristic: \"Cert-Stage vs. Merits-Stage.\"** The observation provided both the cert-stage and merits-stage versions of the same amicus brief. This highlights the importance of always prioritizing the merits-stage document for prediction, as arguments are refined and tailored specifically for the final decision, not just to persuade the Court to take the case."

KERR, DIRECTOR, SOUTH CAROLINA  \nDEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, \nPETITIONER\nv. \nPLANNED PARENTHOOD SOUTH ATLANTIC, ET AL. \nOn Petition for a Writ of Certiorari to the  \nUnited States Court of Appeals  \nfor the Fourth Circuit \nBRIEF IN OPPOSITION\nOPINIONS BELOW \nThe opinion of the court of appeals (Pet. App. 1a-\n36a) is reported at 95 F.4th 152.  The opinion of the \ndistrict court (Pet. App. 68a-79a) is reported at 487 F. \nSupp. 3d 443.   \nPrior relevant opinions of the court of appeals (Pet. \nApp. 38a-65a, 80a-125a) are reported at 27 F.4th 945 \nand 941 F.3d 687.  A prior relevant order of the district \ncourt (Pet. App. 126a-146a) is reported at 326 F. Supp. \n3d 39.  \nJURISDICTION \nThe judgment of the court of appeals was entered \non March 5, 2024.  The petition for a writ of certiorari \nwas filed on June 3, 2024.  The jurisdiction of this \nCourt is invoked under 28 U.S.C. 1254(1).  \n\n2 \n \n \n \nSTATEMENT \nPlanned Parenthood South Atlantic (PPSAT) \nprovides essential medical services, including birth \ncontrol, cancer screenings, and physical exams, to low-\nincome South Carolina residents through the state\u2019s \nMedicaid program.  South Carolina terminated \nPPSAT\u2019s participation in that program, even though \nit \u201cagree[s]\u201d that PPSAT \u201cis perfectly competent to \nprovide  *  *  *  healthcare.\u201d  Pet. App. 41a.  PPSAT \nand one of its patients, who relies on PPSAT for care \nthat is critical for preserving her health, sued under \n42 U.S.C. 1983.  They contended that the termination \nviolates the Medicaid Act\u2019s free-choice-of-provider \nprovision, 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(23)(A), which gives \nMedicaid recipients the right to choose to receive their \nmedical care from any qualified and willing provider.  \nPet. App. 6a, 8a.   \nThe district court preliminarily enjoined the \ndirector of the state health department (petitioner) \nfrom terminating PPSAT\u2019s participation in the \nMedicaid program, Pet. App. 126a-146a; the court of \nappeals affirmed, id. at 80a-119a; and this Court \ndenied certiorari, see id. at 47a. \nThe \ndistrict \ncourt \nthen \ngranted \nsummary \njudgment to PPSAT and the patient, id. at 66a-79a; \nthe court of appeals affirmed, id. at 64a; and this \nCourt granted the petition, vacated, and remanded in \nlight of Health & Hospital Corp. of Marion County v. \nTalevski, 599 U.S. 166 (2023), Pet. App. 37a.  After \nreconsidering its prior holding in light of Talevski, the \ncourt of appeals again affirmed, with all three judges \nagreeing that the Medicaid Act\u2019s free-choice-of-\nprovider provision is privately enforceable under \nSection 1983.  Id. at 1a-35a; id. at 36a (Richardson, J., \nconcurring in the judgment).   \n\n3 \n \n \n \n1. Medicaid is the national health insurance \nprogram for persons of limited financial means.  Pet. \nApp. 5a.  It provides federal funding for medical care \nfor children, needy families, the elderly, the blind, the \ndisabled, and pregnant women.  See 42 U.S.C. \n1396d(a).   \nMedicaid is a joint federal-state effort.  Pet. App. \n5a.  A state must comply with various federal \nrequirements to participate, see Armstrong v. \nExceptional Child Ctr., Inc., 575 U.S. 320, 323 (2015), \nincluding the free-choice-of-provider requirement.  To \ncomply with that requirement, a state\u2019s Medicaid plan \n\u201cmust\u201d provide that \u201cany individual eligible for \nmedical assistance  *  *  *  may obtain such assistance\u201d \nfrom any provider who is \u201cqualified to perform the \nservice or services required\u201d and \u201cwho undertakes to \nprovide \nhim \nsuch \nservices.\u201d \n \n42 \nU.S.C. \n1396a(a)(23)(A).   \n2. PPSAT and its predecessors have provided \nhealth care to low-income residents of South Carolina \nfor four decades.  Pet. App. 7a, 58a.  PPSAT operates \ntwo health centers in the state, one in Charleston and \none in Columbia.  Id. at 6a.  Both are in medically \nunderserved communities.  See Resp. C.A. Br. 4, No. \n21-1043 (4th Cir. May 28, 2021) (21-1043 Resp. C.A. \nBr.).  Those centers serve hundreds of Medicaid \npatients each year.  Pet. App. 7a, 87a. \nPPSAT\u2019s health centers provide essential medical \ncare through Medicaid.  They offer a range of services, \nincluding \nphysical \nexams; \ncancer \nscreenings; \ncontraception; pregnancy testing and counseling; and \nscreening for conditions such as diabetes, depression, \nanemia, cholesterol, thyroid disorders, and high blood \npressure.  Pet. App. 6a, 69a; 21-1043 Resp. C.A. Br. 4.  \nThe health centers provide abortion services, but \nMedicaid does not pay for abortion except in the very \n\n4 \n \n \n \nlimited circumstances required by federal law.  Pet. \nApp. 6a-7a. \nPatients insured through Medicaid choose PPSAT \nfor many reasons.  PPSAT provides non-judgmental, \nhigh-quality medical care.  See Pet. App. 6a-7a.  It also \nhas designed its services to help low-income patients \novercome barriers to accessing care.  Id. at 7a.  For \nexample, PPSAT offers extended hours and flexible \nscheduling; same-day appointments and short wait \ntimes; comprehensive contraceptive care in a single \nappointment; and interpreter services for patients \nwho do not speak English.  Ibid.  PPSAT continued to \noffer high-quality medical care during the COVID-19 \npandemic, including through telemedicine.  21-1043 \nResp. C.A. Br. 5.  That ensured continuity of care for \nlow-income patients and lessened the burdens on \nother parts of the health care system.  Pet. App. 7a-8a \n& n.2.   \nRespondent Julie Edwards is a Medicaid patient \nwho has received care at PPSAT.  Pet. App. 7a.  She \nsuffers from diabetes.  Id. at 44a.  Because doctors \nhave advised her that complications from diabetes \nwould make it dangerous for her to carry a pregnancy \nto term, she sought access to safe and effective birth \ncontrol.  Ibid.  After having difficulty finding a doctor \nwho would treat her, she obtained care at PPSAT.  Id. \nat 7a, 44a.  PPSAT doctors provided her with birth \ncontrol and also informed her that her blood pressure \nwas elevated, so she could obtain follow-up care for \nthat issue.  Ibid.  Ms. Edwards was impressed with \nPPSAT and intends to obtain future gynecological and \nreproductive health care there.  Ibid.   \n3. In July 2018, South Carolina\u2019s Department of \nHealth and Human Services (SCDHHS) terminated \nPPSAT\u2019s participation in the state Medicaid program.  \nPet. App. 8a, 70a.  The termination was prompted by \n\n5 \n \n \n \nthe Governor, who issued two executive orders \ndesigned to withdraw state funding from any \norganization that provides abortions, purportedly \nbased on a twenty-five-year-old statute.  Id. at 8a, 88a; \nsee S.C. Code Ann. \u00a7 43-5-1185. \nRelying on those orders, SCDHHS terminated \nPPSAT\u2019s state Medicaid agreement.  Pet. App. 8a.  \nSCDHHS did not find that PPSAT is unqualified to \nprovide care.  Id. at 87a.  Instead, it terminated \nPPSAT\u2019s participation in Medicaid \u201csolely because \n[PPSAT] performed abortions outside of the Medicaid \nprogram.\u201d  Ibid.  As a result of the termination, \nPPSAT\u2019s health centers immediately had to begin \nturning away Medicaid patients.  Id. at 88a. \n4. Respondents sued under 42 U.S.C. 1983.  Pet. \nApp. 8a.  They alleged, inter alia, that the termination \nviolates the Medicaid Act\u2019s free-choice-of-provider \nprovision.  Ibid.  They sought preliminary injunctive \nrelief, so that Ms. Edwards and other patients could \ncontinue to receive care from their chosen providers.  \nIbid. \nThe \ndistrict \ncourt \nentered \na \npreliminary \ninjunction.  Pet. App. 126a-146a.  As a threshold \nmatter, it held that the Medicaid Act\u2019s free-choice-of-\nprovider requirement is privately enforceable under \nSection 1983 because the statute \u201cunambiguously \nconfers a right\u201d on Medicaid patients to \u201cobtain \nassistance from any qualified and willing provider.\u201d  \nId. at 134a.  Then, on the merits, the court concluded \nthat petitioner likely violated the Medicaid Act by \nterminating PPSAT\u2019s Medicaid participation without \ncause.  Id. at 138a-141a.  The court found it \n\u201cundisputed\u201d that PPSAT is \u201cqualified\u201d to provide \nmedical care, as the statute requires.  Id. at 138a-139a \n(citing 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(23)(A)).   \n\n6 \n \n \n \nThe court of appeals affirmed the preliminary \ninjunction.  Pet. App. 80a-125a.  Like the district \ncourt, the court of appeals concluded that a Medicaid \npatient may sue under Section 1983 to enforce the \nfree-choice-of-provider requirement.  Id. at 94a-98a.  \nApplying this Court\u2019s decisions in Blessing v. \nFreestone, 520 U.S. 329 (1997), and Gonzaga \nUniversity v. Doe, 536 U.S. 273 (2002), the court of \nappeals recognized that a federal statute creates a \nright enforceable under Section 1983 \u201conly when the \nunderlying statute itself unambiguously \u2018confers an \nindividual right\u2019 on the plaintiff.\u201d  Pet. App. 94a \n(quoting Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at 284-285).   \nHere, the court of appeals explained, the statute is \n\u201cunmistakably \nclear\u201d \nin \ncreating \na \nprivately \nenforceable right.  Pet. App. 103a-104a.  \u201cIf th[is] \nlanguage does not suffice to confer a private right, \nenforceable under \u00a7 1983,\u201d the court stated, \u201cit is \ndifficult to see what language would be adequate.\u201d  Id. \nat 102a.  All three judges agreed on this point.  See \nibid.; id. at 120a-125a (Richardson, J., concurring) \n(agreeing that the statute \u201cunambiguously create[s] a \nright privately enforceable under \u00a7 1983\u201d).    \nOn the merits, the court of appeals concluded that \nPPSAT and Ms. Edwards established a likelihood of \nsuccess on the merits because under the free-choice-\nof-provider provision, a state may not exclude a \nqualified and willing provider.  Pet. App. 138a-141a.  \nThe court noted that petitioner did not dispute that \n\u201cPPSAT is professionally qualified to deliver the \nservices that [Ms. Edwards] seeks.\u201d  Id. at 107a; see \nid. at 98a n.3 (\u201cPPSAT\u2019s qualifications are simply not \nin dispute\u201d in this case.).  The court rejected \npetitioner\u2019s argument that it can terminate the \nMedicaid contract of any provider it wishes even when \n\n7 \n \n \n \nit \u201cadmits\u201d that the provider is \u201cperfectly competent.\u201d  \nId. at 109a-110a.   \nPetitioner filed a petition for a writ of certiorari, \nwhich this Court denied.  Baker v. Planned \nParenthood S. Atl., 141 S. Ct. 550 (2020) (No. 19-\n1186). \n5. The district court granted summary judgment \nto PPSAT and Ms. Edwards and entered a permanent \ninjunction.  Pet App. 68a-79a.  The court again held \nthat \nthe \nMedicaid \nAct\u2019s \nfree-choice-of-provider \nprovision is privately enforceable under Section 1983 \nand determined that petitioner violated the Medicaid \nAct by terminating PPSAT\u2019s participation in the state \nMedicaid program.  Id. at 74a.  The court noted that \npetitioner did not dispute that PPSAT is a \u201cmedically \nand professionally qualified provider\u201d and determined \nthat petitioner accordingly had no valid basis for the \ntermination.  Ibid. \nThe court of appeals affirmed.  Pet. App. 38a-64a.  \nThe court again held that Medicaid\u2019s free-choice-of-\nprovider provision confers a right enforceable under \nSection 1983.  Id. at 54a-64a.  The court carefully \nreviewed this Court\u2019s precedents and recognized that \n\u201cnothing \u2018short of an unambiguously conferred right\u2019  \n*  *  *  may support a cause of action.\u201d  Id. at 55a \n(quoting Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at 283).  The statute here, \nthe \ncourt \nexplained, \n\u201cunmistakably \nevinces \nCongress\u2019s \nintention \nto \nconfer \non \nMedicaid \nbeneficiaries a right to the free choice of their \nprovider\u201d because it confers an individual right in \nmandatory terms; courts are competent to determine \nif a provider is qualified; and the Medicaid Act does \nnot provide a comprehensive enforcement scheme that \nshows \nCongress\u2019s \nintent \nto \nforeclose \nprivate \nenforcement.  Id. at 57a-62a.  Again, all three judges \nagreed that the statute unambiguously confers a \n\n8 \n \n \n \nprivate right enforceable under Section 1983.  Id. at \n51a-64a; id. at 65a (Richardson, J., concurring in the \njudgment).  \nThe court of appeals noted that petitioner no \nlonger contested the merits.  Pet. App. 51a.  \nSpecifically, petitioner \u201cd[id] not\u201d renew his merits \narguments \nto \n\u201cchallenge \nthe \ndistrict \ncourt\u2019s \ndetermination (and [the court of appeals\u2019] own \nprevious conclusion) that South Carolina violated\u201d the \nfree-choice-of-provider provision \u201cby terminating \nPlanned Parenthood\u2019s Medicaid provider agreement.\u201d  \nId. at 51a n.1.  \n6. This Court then granted the petition for a writ \nof certiorari in Talevski.  That petition presented two \nquestions:  (1) whether a federal statute that Congress \nenacted using its Spending Clause power can give rise \nto a right enforceable under Section 1983, and \n(2) whether two provisions in the Federal Nursing \nHome \nReform \nAct \n(FNHRA), \n42 \nU.S.C. \n1396r(c)(1)(A)(ii) and 1396r(c)(2)(A), are privately \nenforceable under Section 1983.  See Pet. at *i-ii, \nHealth & Hosp. Corp. of Marion Cnty. v. Talevski, No. \n21-806, 2021 WL 5702312 (Nov. 23, 2021).  The Court \nanswered both questions in the affirmative.  Talevski, \n599 U.S. at 175-191.  In concluding that the provisions \nat issue are privately enforceable under Section 1983, \nthe Court applied its \u201cestablished method for \nascertaining unambiguous conferral\u201d of an individual \nright.  Id. at 183; see id. at 175-191.  \nIn the meantime, petitioner filed a petition for a \nwrit of certiorari in this case.  The Court granted the \npetition, vacated the judgment of the court of appeals, \nand remanded the case for further consideration in \nlight of Talevski.  Kerr v. Planned Parenthood S. Atl., \n143 S. Ct. 2633 (2023) (No. 21-1431). \n\n9 \n \n \n \n7. The court of appeals affirmed.  Pet. App. 1a-\n36a.  \u201c[W]ith the benefit of Talevski\u2019s guidance,\u201d the \ncourt again held that the free-choice-of-provider \nprovision \nconfers \na \nright \nenforceable \nunder \nSection 1983.  Id. at 12a-13a. \nThe court of appeals explained that the free-choice-\nof-provider provision is enforceable under Section \n1983 \nbecause \nit \n\u201cexplicitly \ngives \nMedicaid \nbeneficiaries the right to the provider of their choice\u201d \nand \u201cthere is no indication that Congress wanted to \nforeclose such individuals from seeking relief under \n\u00a7 1983.\u201d  Pet. App. 14a.  On the first point, the court \nreviewed this Court\u2019s precedents and recognized that \n\u201c\u200a\u2018Gonzaga sets forth [the] established method for \nascertaining unambiguous conferral\u2019 of individual \nrights.\u201d  Id. at 19a (quoting Talevski, 599 U.S. at 183).  \nThat test is satisfied, the court continued, \u201cwhere the \nprovision in question is \u2018phrased in terms of the \npersons benefited\u2019 and contains \u2018rights-creating,\u2019 \nindividual-centric language with an \u2018unmistakable \nfocus on the benefited class.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Ibid. (quoting Talevski, \n599 U.S. at 183 (in turn quoting Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at \n284, 287)).   \nHere, the court of appeals explained, the free-\nchoice-of-provider provision unambiguously confers \nrights on individual Medicaid recipients:  \u201cLike the \ntext at issue in Talevski,\u201d the free-choice-of-provider \nprovision \u201cspeak[s] \u2018in terms of the person benefited,\u2019 \nand ha[s] an \u2018unmistakable focus on the benefited \nclass.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Pet. App. 25a (quoting Talevski, 599 U.S. at \n186).  The free-choice-of-provider provision, the court \nexplained, \u201cfocus[es] on discrete beneficiaries and \nguarantee[s] them a choice\u201d of any qualified medical \nprovider \u201cfree from state interference.\u201d  Ibid.  The \ncourt noted that Talevski \u201cbolstered [its] previous \nconclusion\u201d by providing examples of rights-creating \n\n10 \n \n \n \nlanguage \u201csimilar to the language\u201d in the free-choice-\nof-provider provision.  Ibid.   \nPetitioner had argued that the court of appeals \nshould reverse its prior holdings because its decisions \ncited Blessing and Wilder v. Virginia Hospital Ass\u2019n, \n496 U.S. 498 (1990), and in petitioner\u2019s view, those \ndecisions no longer are good law after Talevski.  Pet. \nApp. 14a.

South Carolina terminated the \nMedicaid \nprovider \nagreement \nof \na \nPlanned \nParenthood affiliate without cause.  The affiliate and \none of its patients sued under 42 U.S.C. 1983.  The \npatient invoked the Medicaid Act\u2019s free-choice-of-\nprovider provision, which states that \u201cany individual \neligible for medical assistance\u201d \u201cmay obtain such \nassistance from any institution\u201d that is \u201cqualified to \nperform the service or services required\u201d and \n\u201cundertakes to provide [the individual] such services.\u201d  \n42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(23)(A).   \nThree times, the court of appeals has held that the \nfree-choice-of-provider \nprovision \nunambiguously \nconfers a right that is privately enforceable under \nSection 1983.  In its most recent decision, the court of \nappeals so held after faithfully applying this Court\u2019s \nrecent decision in Health & Hospital Corp. of Marion \nCounty v. Talevski, 599 U.S. 166 (2023).  \nThe question presented is:  \nWhether the Medicaid Act\u2019s free-choice-of-provider \nprovision, 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(23)(A), confers a right \nenforceable under 42 U.S.C. 1983.   \n \n \n\nii \n \n \n \nRULE 29.6 STATEMENT \nPlanned Parenthood South Atlantic is a North \nCarolina non-profit corporation.

KERR, DIRECTOR, SOUTH CAROLINA  \nDEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, \nPETITIONER\nv. \nPLANNED PARENTHOOD SOUTH ATLANTIC, ET AL. \nOn Petition for a Writ of Certiorari to the  \nUnited States Court of Appeals  \nfor the Fourth Circuit \nBRIEF IN OPPOSITION\nOPINIONS BELOW \nThe opinion of the court of appeals (Pet. App. 1a-\n36a) is reported at 95 F.4th 152.  The opinion of the \ndistrict court (Pet. App. 68a-79a) is reported at 487 F. \nSupp. 3d 443.   \nPrior relevant opinions of the court of appeals (Pet. \nApp. 38a-65a, 80a-125a) are reported at 27 F.4th 945 \nand 941 F.3d 687.  A prior relevant order of the district \ncourt (Pet. App. 126a-146a) is reported at 326 F. Supp. \n3d 39.  \nJURISDICTION \nThe judgment of the court of appeals was entered \non March 5, 2024.  The petition for a writ of certiorari \nwas filed on June 3, 2024.  The jurisdiction of this \nCourt is invoked under 28 U.S.C. 1254(1).  \n\n2 \n \n \n \nSTATEMENT \nPlanned Parenthood South Atlantic (PPSAT) \nprovides essential medical services, including birth \ncontrol, cancer screenings, and physical exams, to low-\nincome South Carolina residents through the state\u2019s \nMedicaid program.  South Carolina terminated \nPPSAT\u2019s participation in that program, even though \nit \u201cagree[s]\u201d that PPSAT \u201cis perfectly competent to \nprovide  *  *  *  healthcare.\u201d  Pet. App. 41a.  PPSAT \nand one of its patients, who relies on PPSAT for care \nthat is critical for preserving her health, sued under \n42 U.S.C. 1983.  They contended that the termination \nviolates the Medicaid Act\u2019s free-choice-of-provider \nprovision, 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(23)(A), which gives \nMedicaid recipients the right to choose to receive their \nmedical care from any qualified and willing provider.  \nPet. App. 6a, 8a.   \nThe district court preliminarily enjoined the \ndirector of the state health department (petitioner) \nfrom terminating PPSAT\u2019s participation in the \nMedicaid program, Pet. App. 126a-146a; the court of \nappeals affirmed, id. at 80a-119a; and this Court \ndenied certiorari, see id. at 47a. \nThe \ndistrict \ncourt \nthen \ngranted \nsummary \njudgment to PPSAT and the patient, id. at 66a-79a; \nthe court of appeals affirmed, id. at 64a; and this \nCourt granted the petition, vacated, and remanded in \nlight of Health & Hospital Corp. of Marion County v. \nTalevski, 599 U.S. 166 (2023), Pet. App. 37a.  After \nreconsidering its prior holding in light of Talevski, the \ncourt of appeals again affirmed, with all three judges \nagreeing that the Medicaid Act\u2019s free-choice-of-\nprovider provision is privately enforceable under \nSection 1983.  Id. at 1a-35a; id. at 36a (Richardson, J., \nconcurring in the judgment).   \n\n3 \n \n \n \n1. Medicaid is the national health insurance \nprogram for persons of limited financial means.  Pet. \nApp. 5a.  It provides federal funding for medical care \nfor children, needy families, the elderly, the blind, the \ndisabled, and pregnant women.  See 42 U.S.C. \n1396d(a).   \nMedicaid is a joint federal-state effort.  Pet. App. \n5a.  A state must comply with various federal \nrequirements to participate, see Armstrong v. \nExceptional Child Ctr., Inc., 575 U.S. 320, 323 (2015), \nincluding the free-choice-of-provider requirement.  To \ncomply with that requirement, a state\u2019s Medicaid plan \n\u201cmust\u201d provide that \u201cany individual eligible for \nmedical assistance  *  *  *  may obtain such assistance\u201d \nfrom any provider who is \u201cqualified to perform the \nservice or services required\u201d and \u201cwho undertakes to \nprovide \nhim \nsuch \nservices.\u201d \n \n42 \nU.S.C. \n1396a(a)(23)(A).   \n2. PPSAT and its predecessors have provided \nhealth care to low-income residents of South Carolina \nfor four decades.  Pet. App. 7a, 58a.  PPSAT operates \ntwo health centers in the state, one in Charleston and \none in Columbia.  Id. at 6a.  Both are in medically \nunderserved communities.  See Resp. C.A. Br. 4, No. \n21-1043 (4th Cir. May 28, 2021) (21-1043 Resp. C.A. \nBr.).  Those centers serve hundreds of Medicaid \npatients each year.  Pet. App. 7a, 87a. \nPPSAT\u2019s health centers provide essential medical \ncare through Medicaid.  They offer a range of services, \nincluding \nphysical \nexams; \ncancer \nscreenings; \ncontraception; pregnancy testing and counseling; and \nscreening for conditions such as diabetes, depression, \nanemia, cholesterol, thyroid disorders, and high blood \npressure.  Pet. App. 6a, 69a; 21-1043 Resp. C.A. Br. 4.  \nThe health centers provide abortion services, but \nMedicaid does not pay for abortion except in the very \n\n4 \n \n \n \nlimited circumstances required by federal law.  Pet. \nApp. 6a-7a. \nPatients insured through Medicaid choose PPSAT \nfor many reasons.  PPSAT provides non-judgmental, \nhigh-quality medical care.  See Pet. App. 6a-7a.  It also \nhas designed its services to help low-income patients \novercome barriers to accessing care.  Id. at 7a.  For \nexample, PPSAT offers extended hours and flexible \nscheduling; same-day appointments and short wait \ntimes; comprehensive contraceptive care in a single \nappointment; and interpreter services for patients \nwho do not speak English.  Ibid.  PPSAT continued to \noffer high-quality medical care during the COVID-19 \npandemic, including through telemedicine.  21-1043 \nResp. C.A. Br. 5.  That ensured continuity of care for \nlow-income patients and lessened the burdens on \nother parts of the health care system.  Pet. App. 7a-8a \n& n.2.   \nRespondent Julie Edwards is a Medicaid patient \nwho has received care at PPSAT.  Pet. App. 7a.  She \nsuffers from diabetes.  Id. at 44a.  Because doctors \nhave advised her that complications from diabetes \nwould make it dangerous for her to carry a pregnancy \nto term, she sought access to safe and effective birth \ncontrol.  Ibid.  After having difficulty finding a doctor \nwho would treat her, she obtained care at PPSAT.  Id. \nat 7a, 44a.  PPSAT doctors provided her with birth \ncontrol and also informed her that her blood pressure \nwas elevated, so she could obtain follow-up care for \nthat issue.  Ibid.  Ms. Edwards was impressed with \nPPSAT and intends to obtain future gynecological and \nreproductive health care there.  Ibid.   \n3. In July 2018, South Carolina\u2019s Department of \nHealth and Human Services (SCDHHS) terminated \nPPSAT\u2019s participation in the state Medicaid program.  \nPet. App. 8a, 70a.  The termination was prompted by \n\n5 \n \n \n \nthe Governor, who issued two executive orders \ndesigned to withdraw state funding from any \norganization that provides abortions, purportedly \nbased on a twenty-five-year-old statute.  Id. at 8a, 88a; \nsee S.C. Code Ann. \u00a7 43-5-1185. \nRelying on those orders, SCDHHS terminated \nPPSAT\u2019s state Medicaid agreement.  Pet. App. 8a.  \nSCDHHS did not find that PPSAT is unqualified to \nprovide care.  Id. at 87a.  Instead, it terminated \nPPSAT\u2019s participation in Medicaid \u201csolely because \n[PPSAT] performed abortions outside of the Medicaid \nprogram.\u201d  Ibid.  As a result of the termination, \nPPSAT\u2019s health centers immediately had to begin \nturning away Medicaid patients.  Id. at 88a. \n4. Respondents sued under 42 U.S.C. 1983.  Pet. \nApp. 8a.  They alleged, inter alia, that the termination \nviolates the Medicaid Act\u2019s free-choice-of-provider \nprovision.  Ibid.  They sought preliminary injunctive \nrelief, so that Ms. Edwards and other patients could \ncontinue to receive care from their chosen providers.  \nIbid. \nThe \ndistrict \ncourt \nentered \na \npreliminary \ninjunction.  Pet. App. 126a-146a.  As a threshold \nmatter, it held that the Medicaid Act\u2019s free-choice-of-\nprovider requirement is privately enforceable under \nSection 1983 because the statute \u201cunambiguously \nconfers a right\u201d on Medicaid patients to \u201cobtain \nassistance from any qualified and willing provider.\u201d  \nId. at 134a.  Then, on the merits, the court concluded \nthat petitioner likely violated the Medicaid Act by \nterminating PPSAT\u2019s Medicaid participation without \ncause.  Id. at 138a-141a.  The court found it \n\u201cundisputed\u201d that PPSAT is \u201cqualified\u201d to provide \nmedical care, as the statute requires.  Id. at 138a-139a \n(citing 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(23)(A)).   \n\n6 \n \n \n \nThe court of appeals affirmed the preliminary \ninjunction.  Pet. App. 80a-125a.  Like the district \ncourt, the court of appeals concluded that a Medicaid \npatient may sue under Section 1983 to enforce the \nfree-choice-of-provider requirement.  Id. at 94a-98a.  \nApplying this Court\u2019s decisions in Blessing v. \nFreestone, 520 U.S. 329 (1997), and Gonzaga \nUniversity v. Doe, 536 U.S. 273 (2002), the court of \nappeals recognized that a federal statute creates a \nright enforceable under Section 1983 \u201conly when the \nunderlying statute itself unambiguously \u2018confers an \nindividual right\u2019 on the plaintiff.\u201d  Pet. App. 94a \n(quoting Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at 284-285).   \nHere, the court of appeals explained, the statute is \n\u201cunmistakably \nclear\u201d \nin \ncreating \na \nprivately \nenforceable right.  Pet. App. 103a-104a.  \u201cIf th[is] \nlanguage does not suffice to confer a private right, \nenforceable under \u00a7 1983,\u201d the court stated, \u201cit is \ndifficult to see what language would be adequate.\u201d  Id. \nat 102a.  All three judges agreed on this point.  See \nibid.; id. at 120a-125a (Richardson, J., concurring) \n(agreeing that the statute \u201cunambiguously create[s] a \nright privately enforceable under \u00a7 1983\u201d).    \nOn the merits, the court of appeals concluded that \nPPSAT and Ms. Edwards established a likelihood of \nsuccess on the merits because under the free-choice-\nof-provider provision, a state may not exclude a \nqualified and willing provider.  Pet. App. 138a-141a.  \nThe court noted that petitioner did not dispute that \n\u201cPPSAT is professionally qualified to deliver the \nservices that [Ms. Edwards] seeks.\u201d  Id. at 107a; see \nid. at 98a n.3 (\u201cPPSAT\u2019s qualifications are simply not \nin dispute\u201d in this case.).  The court rejected \npetitioner\u2019s argument that it can terminate the \nMedicaid contract of any provider it wishes even when \n\n7 \n \n \n \nit \u201cadmits\u201d that the provider is \u201cperfectly competent.\u201d  \nId. at 109a-110a.   \nPetitioner filed a petition for a writ of certiorari, \nwhich this Court denied.  Baker v. Planned \nParenthood S. Atl., 141 S. Ct. 550 (2020) (No. 19-\n1186). \n5. The district court granted summary judgment \nto PPSAT and Ms. Edwards and entered a permanent \ninjunction.  Pet App. 68a-79a.  The court again held \nthat \nthe \nMedicaid \nAct\u2019s \nfree-choice-of-provider \nprovision is privately enforceable under Section 1983 \nand determined that petitioner violated the Medicaid \nAct by terminating PPSAT\u2019s participation in the state \nMedicaid program.  Id. at 74a.  The court noted that \npetitioner did not dispute that PPSAT is a \u201cmedically \nand professionally qualified provider\u201d and determined \nthat petitioner accordingly had no valid basis for the \ntermination.  Ibid. \nThe court of appeals affirmed.  Pet. App. 38a-64a.  \nThe court again held that Medicaid\u2019s free-choice-of-\nprovider provision confers a right enforceable under \nSection 1983.  Id. at 54a-64a.  The court carefully \nreviewed this Court\u2019s precedents and recognized that \n\u201cnothing \u2018short of an unambiguously conferred right\u2019  \n*  *  *  may support a cause of action.\u201d  Id. at 55a \n(quoting Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at 283).  The statute here, \nthe \ncourt \nexplained, \n\u201cunmistakably \nevinces \nCongress\u2019s \nintention \nto \nconfer \non \nMedicaid \nbeneficiaries a right to the free choice of their \nprovider\u201d because it confers an individual right in \nmandatory terms; courts are competent to determine \nif a provider is qualified; and the Medicaid Act does \nnot provide a comprehensive enforcement scheme that \nshows \nCongress\u2019s \nintent \nto \nforeclose \nprivate \nenforcement.  Id. at 57a-62a.  Again, all three judges \nagreed that the statute unambiguously confers a \n\n8 \n \n \n \nprivate right enforceable under Section 1983.  Id. at \n51a-64a; id. at 65a (Richardson, J., concurring in the \njudgment).  \nThe court of appeals noted that petitioner no \nlonger contested the merits.  Pet. App. 51a.  \nSpecifically, petitioner \u201cd[id] not\u201d renew his merits \narguments \nto \n\u201cchallenge \nthe \ndistrict \ncourt\u2019s \ndetermination (and [the court of appeals\u2019] own \nprevious conclusion) that South Carolina violated\u201d the \nfree-choice-of-provider provision \u201cby terminating \nPlanned Parenthood\u2019s Medicaid provider agreement.\u201d  \nId. at 51a n.1.  \n6. This Court then granted the petition for a writ \nof certiorari in Talevski.  That petition presented two \nquestions:  (1) whether a federal statute that Congress \nenacted using its Spending Clause power can give rise \nto a right enforceable under Section 1983, and \n(2) whether two provisions in the Federal Nursing \nHome \nReform \nAct \n(FNHRA), \n42 \nU.S.C. \n1396r(c)(1)(A)(ii) and 1396r(c)(2)(A), are privately \nenforceable under Section 1983.  See Pet. at *i-ii, \nHealth & Hosp. Corp. of Marion Cnty. v. Talevski, No. \n21-806, 2021 WL 5702312 (Nov. 23, 2021).  The Court \nanswered both questions in the affirmative.  Talevski, \n599 U.S. at 175-191.  In concluding that the provisions \nat issue are privately enforceable under Section 1983, \nthe Court applied its \u201cestablished method for \nascertaining unambiguous conferral\u201d of an individual \nright.  Id. at 183; see id. at 175-191.  \nIn the meantime, petitioner filed a petition for a \nwrit of certiorari in this case.  The Court granted the \npetition, vacated the judgment of the court of appeals, \nand remanded the case for further consideration in \nlight of Talevski.  Kerr v. Planned Parenthood S. Atl., \n143 S. Ct. 2633 (2023) (No. 21-1431). \n\n9 \n \n \n \n7. The court of appeals affirmed.  Pet. App. 1a-\n36a.  \u201c[W]ith the benefit of Talevski\u2019s guidance,\u201d the \ncourt again held that the free-choice-of-provider \nprovision \nconfers \na \nright \nenforceable \nunder \nSection 1983.  Id. at 12a-13a. \nThe court of appeals explained that the free-choice-\nof-provider provision is enforceable under Section \n1983 \nbecause \nit \n\u201cexplicitly \ngives \nMedicaid \nbeneficiaries the right to the provider of their choice\u201d \nand \u201cthere is no indication that Congress wanted to \nforeclose such individuals from seeking relief under \n\u00a7 1983.\u201d  Pet. App. 14a.  On the first point, the court \nreviewed this Court\u2019s precedents and recognized that \n\u201c\u200a\u2018Gonzaga sets forth [the] established method for \nascertaining unambiguous conferral\u2019 of individual \nrights.\u201d  Id. at 19a (quoting Talevski, 599 U.S. at 183).  \nThat test is satisfied, the court continued, \u201cwhere the \nprovision in question is \u2018phrased in terms of the \npersons benefited\u2019 and contains \u2018rights-creating,\u2019 \nindividual-centric language with an \u2018unmistakable \nfocus on the benefited class.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Ibid. (quoting Talevski, \n599 U.S. at 183 (in turn quoting Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at \n284, 287)).   \nHere, the court of appeals explained, the free-\nchoice-of-provider provision unambiguously confers \nrights on individual Medicaid recipients:  \u201cLike the \ntext at issue in Talevski,\u201d the free-choice-of-provider \nprovision \u201cspeak[s] \u2018in terms of the person benefited,\u2019 \nand ha[s] an \u2018unmistakable focus on the benefited \nclass.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Pet. App. 25a (quoting Talevski, 599 U.S. at \n186).  The free-choice-of-provider provision, the court \nexplained, \u201cfocus[es] on discrete beneficiaries and \nguarantee[s] them a choice\u201d of any qualified medical \nprovider \u201cfree from state interference.\u201d  Ibid.  The \ncourt noted that Talevski \u201cbolstered [its] previous \nconclusion\u201d by providing examples of rights-creating \n\n10 \n \n \n \nlanguage \u201csimilar to the language\u201d in the free-choice-\nof-provider provision.  Ibid.   \nPetitioner had argued that the court of appeals \nshould reverse its prior holdings because its decisions \ncited Blessing and Wilder v. Virginia Hospital Ass\u2019n, \n496 U.S. 498 (1990), and in petitioner\u2019s view, those \ndecisions no longer are good law after Talevski.  Pet. \nApp. 14a.  The court of appeals noted that Talevski did \nnot overrule either decision.  Id. at 22a-23a, 28a.  But \neither way, the court explained, \u201cthe central analysis \nremains the same\u201d \u2013 Talevski made clear that courts \nshould \u201clook primarily to Gonzaga\u201d to determine \nwhether Congress unambiguously conferred an \nindividual right, and the court of appeals\u2019 prior \ndecisions \u201cturned upon\u201d that same analysis and \n\u201crelied heavily on Gonzaga.\u201d  Id. at 23a.   \nThe court of appeals then reiterated its conclusion \nthat \nthe \nMedicaid \nAct \ndoes \nnot \nprovide \na \ncomprehensive enforcement scheme that shows \nCongress\u2019s intent to foreclose private enforcement.  \nPet. App. 32a-33a.  The court noted that petitioner \nhad \u201cnot asked us to revisit this question [i]n this \nappeal.\u201d  Id. at 33a. \nFinally, the court of appeals noted that it is \nundisputed that PPSAT is a qualified and willing \nprovider and that petitioner\u2019s decision to terminate \nPPSAT from South Carolina\u2019s Medicaid program was \nunjustified.  Pet. App. 33a-34a.  The court emphasized \nthat petitioner \u201chas not contested\u201d \u2013 at any time \n\u201cduring the long path of this litigation\u201d \u2013 that PPSAT \n\u201cis professionally qualified to provide the care that the \nplaintiff seeks.\u201d  Id. at 33a.  \nJudge Richardson concurred in the judgment.  Pet. \nApp. 35a-36a (Richardson, J., concurring in the \njudgment).  He agreed that the statute here \u201ccreate[s] \n\n11 \n \n \n \nan individual right enforceable under 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1983,\u201d but suggested this Court provide additional \nguidance on the relevant legal standard.  Id. at 36a \n(Richardson, J., concurring in the judgment).     \nARGUMENT \nPetitioner asks this Court (Pet. 15-16) to grant \ncertiorari to address two questions:  (1) whether the \nMedicaid Act\u2019s free-choice-of-provider provision, 42 \nU.S.C. 1396a(a)(23)(A), is privately enforceable under \n42 U.S.C. 1983, and (2) if so, whether the free-choice-\nof-provider provision allows a state to terminate a \nMedicaid provider for any reason, even if the state \nacknowledges that the provider is professionally \nqualified.  This Court\u2019s review is not warranted on \neither question.   \nOn the first question, the court of appeals \nfaithfully applied this Court\u2019s precedents, including \nTalevski, and its conclusion is consistent with that of \nnearly every court that has considered the issue.  \nPetitioner contends (Pet. 31-32) that the courts of \nappeals need guidance on the appropriate test for \ndetermining whether a federal statute is privately \nenforceable under Section 1983.  But Talevski already \nprovided that guidance; the Court reaffirmed that \ncourts should use its \u201cestablished method\u201d (599 U.S. \nat 183) for deciding whether a provision is privately \nenforceable.  This Court has repeatedly denied \npetitions presenting this first question \u2013 including in \nthis case1 \u2013 and it should do the same here.   \n \n1 Baker v. Planned Parenthood S. Atl., 141 S. Ct. 550 (2020) (No. \n19-1186); Gee v. Planned Parenthood of Gulf Coast, Inc., 139 \nS. Ct. 408 (2018) (No. 17-1492); Andersen v. Planned Parenthood \nof Kan. & Mid-Mo., 139 S. Ct. 638 (2018) (No. 17-1340); Betlach \nv. Planned Parenthood Ariz., Inc., 571 U.S. 1198 (2014) (No. 13-\n \n\n12 \n \n \n \nThis case does not present the second question, \nbecause that question concerns whether a patient has \na right to choose an unqualified provider, and \npetitioner has conceded throughout this litigation \nthat PPSAT is a qualified provider.  Further, \npetitioner presented no argument on this issue to the \ndistrict court on summary judgment or to the court of \nappeals in two rounds of briefing on appeal from that \ndecision.  He accordingly has forfeited any argument \nbased on that question.  Even if the question were \npresented here, petitioner\u2019s argument is mistaken, \nand no circuit split exists.  Further review therefore is \nunwarranted.      \nI. \nTHE PRIVATE-RIGHT-OF-ACTION ISSUE \nDOES NOT WARRANT THIS COURT\u2019S \nREVIEW \nPetitioner contends (Pet. 17-32) that the Medicaid \nAct\u2019s \nfree-choice-of-provider \nprovision, \n42 \nU.S.C. 1396a(a)(23)(A), is not privately enforceable \nunder 42 U.S.C. 1983.  He is wrong, and the issue does \nnot warrant the Court\u2019s review.  \nA. The court of appeals\u2019 decision is correct. \n1. Section 1983 authorizes \u201cany citizen of the \nUnited States or other person within [its] jurisdiction\u201d \nto sue any person who, \u201cunder color of\u201d state law, \n\u201cdepriv[ed]\u201d him or her \u201cof any rights, privileges, or \nimmunities secured by\u201d federal law.  42 U.S.C. 1983.  \nA person deprived of a right created by a federal \nstatute by a state actor may sue under Section 1983.  \nSee Maine v. Thiboutot, 448 U.S. 1, 4 (1980). \n \n621); Secretary of Ind. Fam. & Soc. Servs. Admin. v. Planned \nParenthood of Ind., Inc., 569 U.S. 1004 (2013) (No. 12-1039). \n\n13 \n \n \n \nThe federal statute at issue here gives a Medicaid \npatient the right to obtain care from the qualified and \nwilling provider of his or her choice.  It states:  \nA State plan for medical assistance must  *  *  *  \nprovide that  *  *  *  any individual eligible for \nmedical assistance  *  *  *  may obtain such \nassistance from any institution  *  *  *  qualified \nto perform the service or services required  \n*  *  *  [that] undertakes to provide him such \nservices.  \n42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(23)(A).   \nCongress enacted this provision to ensure that \nMedicaid recipients, like other individuals, could \nmake deeply personal choices about where to obtain \nmedical care without states \u201crestricting beneficiaries \nto certain providers.\u201d  Pet. App. 6a; see, e.g., S. Rep. \nNo. 744, 90th Cong., 1st Sess. 183 (1967).  Congress \nthen reiterated the importance of this right in the \nfamily-planning context, providing that even when a \nstate uses a managed-care system, the state cannot \nlimit a patient\u2019s free choice of provider for family-\nplanning services.  See 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(23)(B) \n(cross-reference to 42 U.S.C. 1396d(a)(4)(C)). \n2. In a careful and thorough opinion, the court of \nappeals faithfully applied this Court\u2019s precedents and \ncorrectly concluded that the Medicaid Act\u2019s free-\nchoice-of-provider provision is privately enforceable \nunder Section 1983.  Pet. App. 5a-35a.  All three \njudges agreed that the statute at issue here is \u201cclear \nand \nunambiguous\u201d \nin \nconferring \na \nprivately \nenforceable right.  Id. at 29a; see id. at 36a \n(Richardson, J., concurring in the judgment).  This \nwas not a close call:  The court found it \u201chard to \nconceive of any text  *  *  *  that would permit\u201d a \nprivate right of action \u201c[i]f the language of this \n\n14 \n \n \n \nmedical provider provision does not suffice.\u201d  Id. at \n35a.   \nThe court of appeals began its analysis by carefully \nreviewing this Court\u2019s precedents, including the \nrecent decision in Talevski.  Pet. App. 15a-21a.  \nTalevski applied the Court\u2019s settled precedents to hold \nthat a nursing facility resident could sue under \nSection 1983 to enforce two particular provisions of \nFNHRA.  599 U.S. at 180-191.  In so holding, Talevski \nexplained that \u201c\u200a\u2018Gonzaga sets forth [the] established \nmethod for ascertaining unambiguous conferral\u2019 of \nindividual rights,\u201d and that this test is satisfied \n\u201cwhere the provision in question is \u2018phrased in terms \nof the persons benefited\u2019 and contains \u2018rights-\ncreating,\u2019 \nindividual-centric \nlanguage \nwith \nan \n\u2018unmistakable focus on the benefited class.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Pet. App. \n19a (quoting Talevski, 599 U.S. at 183 (in turn quoting \nGonzaga, 536 U.S. at 284, 287)).  As the court of \nappeals recognized, this Court\u2019s decisions set a \n\u201cdemanding bar\u201d for finding a privately enforceable \nright.  Id. at 22a (quoting Talevski, 599 U.S. at 180). \nApplying that guidance, the court of appeals \ncorrectly concluded that the free-choice-of-provider \nprovision is privately enforceable.  The court \n\u201crigorously examine[d]\u201d the statutory text and \nconcluded that it unambiguously gives Medicaid \npatients an individual right to obtain care from their \nprovider of choice.  Pet. App. 22a, 25a.  The statute \nspecifically defines the intended class of beneficiaries \n(\u201cany individual  *  *  *  eligible for medical assistance\u201d \nunder Medicaid) and gives them a particular right \n(the right to \u201cobtain [care] from any\u201d qualified \nprovider). \n \nId. \nat \n23a \n(quoting \n42 \nU.S.C. \n1396a(a)(23)(A); emphasis omitted).   \nThat language is \u201ca prime example of the kind of \n\u2018rights-creating\u2019 language required to confer a \n\n15 \n \n \n \npersonal right on a discrete class of persons.\u201d  Pet. \nApp. 25a-26a (discussing Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at 284 \nn.3).  It \u201cspeak[s] in terms of the persons benefited and \nha[s] an unmistakable focus on the benefited class.\u201d  \nId. at 25a (quoting Talevski, 599 U.S. at 186).  Indeed, \nthe court explained, Talevski \u201cbolstered\u201d the court\u2019s \nprior conclusion on this point \u201cby providing additional \nexamples of rights-creating language similar to the \nlanguage at issue here.\u201d  Ibid.  \nFurther, the court of appeals found no indication \nin the statutory text that Congress intended to \nforeclose a Section 1983 remedy.  Pet. App. 32a-33a.  \nThere is no \u201cincompatibility between enforcement \nunder \u00a7 1983 and the enforcement scheme that \nCongress has enacted.\u201d  Id. at 32a (quoting Talevski, \n599 U.S. at 187).  That is particularly true, the court \nexplained, because \u201cthere is no way for Medicaid \nbeneficiaries to challenge disqualifications of their \npreferred providers through the administrative \nscheme.\u201d  Ibid.2  Notably, petitioner did not contest \nthis point in the court of appeals.  The court previously \nhad held that \u201cthe Medicaid Act provides no \ncomprehensive enforcement scheme sufficient to \novercome the presumption that the free-choice-of-\nprovider provision is enforceable under \u00a7 1983,\u201d id. at \n32a (quoting id. at 102a), and \u201cSouth Carolina d[id] \n \n2 Petitioner asserts in passing (Pet. 9) that PPSAT was required \nto exhaust state administrative remedies.  But patients such as \nMs. Edwards \u2013 the people with the free-choice-of-provider right \n\u2013 cannot participate in this administrative review process.  And \neven if Ms. Edwards could use that process, both the district \ncourt and court of appeals found that doing so would be \u201cfutile.\u201d  \nPet. App. 101a n.4.  Besides, it is well-established that a person \nis not required to exhaust administrative remedies before filing \nsuit under Section 1983.  Patsy v. Board of Regents of State of \nFla., 457 U.S. 496, 516 (1982); see Pet. App. 101a n.4.   \n\n16 \n \n \n \nnot ask\u201d the court \u201cto revisit this question [i]n this \nappeal,\u201d id. at 33a.  \n3. Petitioner offers two main criticisms of the \ncourt of appeals\u2019 decision.  Pet. 30-32, 36-37.  Neither \nhas merit.  \nFirst, petitioner argues (Pet. 36-37) that the court \nof appeals erred in reading the free-choice-of-provider \nprovision to create an unambiguously conferred right.  \nHe contends (ibid.) that the free-choice-of-provider \nprovision lacks rights-creating language, comparing it \nto the provision in Gonzaga that \u201csp[oke] only in terms \nof institutional policy and practice, not individual[s].\u201d  \n536 U.S. at 288 (discussing 20 U.S.C. 1232g(b)(1)-(2)).  \nThat comparison is inapt.  Whereas the provision in \nGonzaga concerned only institutional \u201cpolic[ies] or \npractice[s],\u201d 20 U.S.C. 1232g(b)(1)-(2), the free-choice-\nof-provider provision addresses whether \u201cindividual\u201d \nMedicaid patients \u201cmay obtain\u201d \u201cmedical assistance\u201d \nfrom \ntheir \nchosen \nproviders, \n42 \nU.S.C. \n1396a(a)(23)(A). \nPetitioner also notes (Pet. 36-37) that the free-\nchoice-of-provider provision does not contain the word \n\u201cright.\u201d  Yet there is no basis for petitioner\u2019s \u201cmagic \nwords\u201d rule.  Pet. App. 26a (quoting Federal Aviation \nAdmin. v. Copper, 566 U.S. 284, 291 (2012)).  The free-\nchoice-of-provider provision has an \u201cunmistakable \nfocus\u201d on the benefited class and is \u201cphrased in terms \nof the persons benefited,\u201d which \u201csatisfie[s]\u201d this \nCourt\u2019s test for whether a statute contains the \nnecessary rights-creating language.  Talevski, 599 \nU.S. at 183. \nSecond, petitioner argues (Pet. 30-31, 35-36) that \nthe court of appeals erred by putting too much weight \non this Court\u2019s decisions in Blessing and Wilder.  That \nis mistaken.  The court of appeals recognized that \n\n17 \n \n \n \n\u201c\u200a\u2018Gonzaga sets forth [the] established method for \nascertaining unambiguous conferral\u2019 of individual \nrights.\u201d  Id. at 19a (quoting Talevski, 599 U.S. at 183).  \nThe court then correctly stated and applied that test, \nexplaining that, for a statutory provision to be \nprivately enforceable, it must unambiguously confer \nan individual right on a particular class of people, and \nit must not include a comprehensive enforcement \nscheme showing a congressional intent to preclude \nprivate enforcement.  Pet. App. 24a-31a, 32a.  \nFurther, the court correctly noted that this Court has \nnot overruled Blessing.  Id. at 22a-23a.  Indeed, as the \ncourt noted (id. at 31a), both Gonzaga and Talevski \ncited Blessing.  See Talevski, 599 U.S. at 189; \nGonzaga, 536 U.S. at 287-289.   \nFar from changing the standard for determining \nwhether a federal law secures rights for Section 1983 \npurposes, the Court in Talevski stated that it was \napplying its \u201cestablished method for ascertaining \nunambiguous conferral\u201d to the federal statute at issue \nin that case.  599 U.S. at 183; see id. at 184-186.  The \ncourt of appeals likewise recognized that, throughout \nthis Court\u2019s line of decisions, the \u201ccentral inquiry\u201d has \nremained the same \u2013 \u201cwhether Congress conferred a \nclear and unambiguous right upon a discrete class of \nbeneficiaries.\u201d  Pet. App. 21a.  The court of appeals \nexplained that this analysis \u201cremains the same\u201d \u201cwith \nor without Blessing,\u201d id. at 23a, and it did not even \ncite Blessing in evaluating whether the free-choice-of-\nprovider provision is enforceable under Section 1983, \nsee id. at 24a-33a.  Instead, as in its prior decisions, it \nfocused on Gonzaga.  Id. at 23a-26a.  Petitioner is \n\n18 \n \n \n \ntherefore wrong to criticize the court of appeals for its \nbrief citations to Blessing.3  \nPetitioner likewise is wrong to say (Pet. 31, 35) \nthat the court of appeals improperly relied on Wilder.  \nThe court cited Wilder only for a narrow proposition \u2013 \nthat a provision in the Medicaid Act can create a \nprivately enforceable right.  Pet. App. 27a, 32a.  That \nis just a statement of the holding in Wilder.  Id. at 27a \n(citing Wilder, 496 U.S. at 509-510 (holding that the \nBoren Amendment is privately enforceable under \nSection 1983)).  That holding has never been called \ninto question by this Court.  In fact, the Court \n\u201capprovingly cited Wilder on this point\u201d in City of \nRancho Palos Verdes v. Abrams, 544 U.S. 113, 122 \n(2005).  Pet. App. 62a.   \nThis Court has questioned other parts of Wilder, \nbut the court of appeals recognized that, stating that \nthis Court has \u201cnoted  * * *  that \u2018[its] later opinions \nplainly repudiate the ready implication of a \u00a7 1983 \naction that Wilder exemplified\u2019\u201d and \u201cexpressly \n\u2018reject[ed] the notion,\u2019 implicit in Wilder, \u2018that [its] \ncases permit anything short of an unambiguously \nconferred right.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Pet. App. 27a-28a (quoting \nArmstrong, 575 U.S. at 330 n.*).   \n \n3  Notably, earlier in this case, petitioner took a different \nposition from the one he takes now; he actually relied on Blessing \nas providing the relevant legal standard.  For example, in his \nappeal of the preliminary injunction, petitioner argued that a \nstatute can give rise to a right enforceable through Section 1983 \nif the factors identified by this Court in Blessing are satisfied.  \nSee, e.g., Pet. C.A. Prelim. Inj. Br. 22-23, No. 18-2133 (4th Cir. \nNov. 26, 2018) (arguing that a plaintiff must \u201cmeet all  * * *  of \nthe[] requirements\u201d from Blessing for \u201ca \u00a7 1983 claim [to] lie\u201d); \nPet. C.A. Prelim. Inj. Reply Br. 3-10, No. 18-2133 (4th Cir. Feb. \n4, 2019) (similar).  This is reason to doubt petitioner\u2019s claimed \nneed for clarification about Blessing.    \n\n19 \n \n \n \nIn any event, the court of appeals explained that \npetitioner\u2019s arguments failed even if he were correct \nthat all of Wilder had been abrogated, because \nTalevski also \u201crejected the argument that provisions \nthat speak to and place obligations on government \nofficials [like the Medicaid Act] cannot create \nindividual rights.\u201d  Id. at 28a; see ibid. (\u201c[E]ven if \n[Wilder were] abrogated  * * *  the State\u2019s argument \nremains unpersuasive.\u201d).  Again, with or without \nWilder, the analysis and outcome remain the same.  \nMore generally, petitioner overstates the supposed \nneed for clarification about the status of Blessing and \nWilder.  The Court had the opportunity to provide \nguidance in Talevski, and it did so, explaining that \nGonzaga provides the relevant test, and that this test \nreflects \nthe \nCourt\u2019s \n\u201cestablished \nmethod \nfor \nascertaining unambiguous conferral\u201d of an individual \nright.  599 U.S. at 183.  All three judges of the court of \nappeals understood that the \u201ccentral inquiry\u201d was \nwhether Congress unambiguously conferred an \nindividual right on Medicaid patients, and all three \njudges agreed that Congress did that here.  Pet. App. \n31a, 35a; see id. at 36a (Richardson, J., concurring in \nthe judgment).  Under those circumstances, there is \nno need for this Court\u2019s review, particularly because \nthis Court \u201creviews judgments, not statements in \nopinions.\u201d  Black v. Cutter Labs., 351 U.S. 292, 297 \n(1956); see Camreta v. Greene, 563 U.S. 692, 704 \n(2011) (This Court\u2019s \u201cresources are not well spent \nsuperintending each word a lower court utters en \nroute to a final judgment.\u201d). \nB. Any differences in the approaches of the courts \nof appeals do not warrant this Court\u2019s review. \n1. Nearly every court of appeals that has \nconsidered the issue has held that the Medicaid Act\u2019s \nfree-choice-of-provider \nprovision, \n42 \nU.S.C. \n\n20 \n \n \n \n1396a(a)(23)(A), \nis \nprivately \nenforceable \nunder \nSection 1983.4  And nearly every district court that \nhas considered the issue has agreed with that \nconclusion.5 \n \n4 See Planned Parenthood of Kan. & Mid-Mo. v.

Id. at 357-358. \nThe Fifth Circuit stated that it is \u201cnot clear\u201d that \nthe Fourth Circuit would disagree with its holding, \nbecause that holding was premised on Texas \ndisqualifying the providers based on specific factual \nfindings of a state administrative agency, whereas \nSouth Carolina did not claim any health or safety \nbasis for disqualifying PPSAT.  Kauffman, 981 F.3d at \n365.  Indeed, as the court of appeals here explained, \nSouth Carolina has never contested, \u201cduring the long \npath of this litigation, that Planned Parenthood is \nprofessionally qualified to provide the care that the \nplaintiff seeks.\u201d  Pet. App. 33a.  The Fifth Circuit \ndistinguished private-right-of-action holdings from \nthree other courts of appeals on similar grounds.  \nKauffman, 981 F.3d at 365, 367.   \nThe Eighth Circuit\u2019s decision in Does v. Gillespie, \n867 F.3d 1034 (8th Cir. 2017), is distinguishable for \nthe same reason.  In that case, the Arkansas \nDepartment of Human Services terminated the \nprovider\u2019s participation in the state\u2019s Medicaid \nprogram \u201cfor cause\u201d based on ostensible \u201cevidence [of\u200a] \nunethical\u201d action and \u201cwrongful conduct.\u201d  Id. at 1038.  \nLike the Fifth Circuit, the Eighth Circuit had no \nreason to address whether a patient may challenge \nthe termination of a provider\u2019s Medicaid contract \nwhen the provider\u2019s professional qualifications are \nundisputed. \nFurther, the Eighth Circuit\u2019s decision relied on an \nanalysis that has been foreclosed by Talevski.  That \ncourt did not use the test set out by this Court, which \nfocuses on whether the specific language at issue \nincludes the necessary \u201crights-creating language.\u201d  \n\n23 \n \n \n \nTalevski, 599 U.S. at 183 (quoting Gonzaga, 536 U.S. \nat 290).  Rather than analyze the specific text of 42 \nU.S.C. 1396a(a)(23)(A), the court treated the mere \npossibility of federal enforcement as precluding \nprivate enforcement, Gillespie, 867 F.3d at 1041, a \nview that Talevski expressly rejected, 599 U.S. at 186-\n192.   \nThe Eighth Circuit also focused on the fact that the \nprovision exists within a set of requirements for state \nMedicaid plans.  Gillespie, 867 F.3d at 1041.  But \nTalevski rejected that reasoning as well, explaining \n(in the context of a similar statute) that it is wrong to \nsay that provisions that impose obligations on third \nparties cannot create individual rights.  599 U.S. at \n185.  Further, as the court of appeals noted (Pet. App. \n29a), the Medicaid Act itself refutes that reasoning, \nbecause it expressly instructs that a provision of the \nAct \u201cis not to be deemed unenforceable because of its \ninclusion in a section of [the Act]  * * *  specifying the \nrequired contents of a State plan.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 1320a-2.   \nFinally, the Eighth Circuit\u2019s decision in Gillespie is \nout of step with its own precedent, because in other \nprivate-right-of-action cases, that court has faithfully \napplied Gonzaga.  See, e.g., Spectra Commc\u2019ns Grp. v. \nCity of Cameron, Mo., 806 F.3d 1113, 1120 (8th Cir. \n2015); Lankford v. Sherman, 451 F.3d 496, 508-509 \n(8th Cir. 2006).  The Eighth Circuit should have an \nopportunity to reconsider its analysis in Gillespie in \nlight of these decisions and in light of the guidance \nthis Court provided in Talevski. \n3. There is no urgent need for this Court\u2019s review.  \nContrary to petitioner\u2019s suggestion (Pet. 35-37), the \nquestion presented does not arise frequently.  Since \nthe first appellate decision permitting enforcement of \nthe free-choice-of-provider provision under Section \n1983 (the Sixth Circuit\u2019s decision in Harris in March \n\n24 \n \n \n \n2006), respondents are aware of only twelve district \ncourt decisions involving lawsuits challenging the \ntermination of Medicaid providers through the free-\nchoice-of-provider provision and Section 1983, see \nnote 5, supra (first twelve cases), plus a handful of \ncases challenging other state policies or actions using \nthose statutes, see, e.g., ibid. (next six cases).  All but \nthree of the twelve cases were efforts by states to \ntarget Planned Parenthood in ways courts have \nrecognized \nare \nunwarranted \nand \npolitically \nmotivated.  See, e.g., Bader v. Wernert, 178 F. Supp. \n3d 703, 724 (N.D. Ind. 2016).  They involved \npretextual termination attempts lacking any legal \nbasis or evidentiary support.   \nFurther, the issue has arisen less and less \nfrequently in recent years.  Outside of this case, no \ncourt of appeals has addressed the question presented \nsince 2020.  See note 4, supra.  The small and \ndecreasing number of these cases shows that \npetitioner is wrong to say (Pet. 35) that the court of \nappeals\u2019 decision will lead to additional litigation.  \nThis Court has denied certiorari on this issue multiple \ntimes, see note 1, supra, and the passage of time has \nmade it even more clear that there is no need for this \nCourt\u2019s review.  \nIf this Court potentially were interested in \nconsidering this issue, it should first give the courts of \nappeals the opportunity to consider its recent \nguidance in Talevski.  Only the court of appeals in the \ndecision below \u2013 and no other court \u2013 has had the \nopportunity to consider the effect of Talevski on the \nquestion whether the free-choice-of-provider provision \nconfers a right enforceable under Section 1983.  In \nlight of the decreasing number of cases raising this \nissue, there may never be a need for this Court\u2019s \nreview.  But if petitioner is correct and this remains a \n\n25 \n \n \n \nlive issue, then this Court will have other \nopportunities to consider the issue after other courts \nof appeals have applied the guidance in Talevski. \nII. THE \nUNQUALIFIED-PROVIDER \nISSUE \nDOES NOT WARRANT THIS COURT\u2019S \nREVIEW  \nPetitioner contends (Pet. 33-34) that if the \nMedicaid \nAct\u2019s \nfree-choice-of-provider \nprovision \nconfers an individual right enforceable under Section \n1983, this Court should grant review to decide \nwhether that right extends to providers that a state \nhas labeled \u201c[un]qualified.\u201d  This case does not present \nthat question, because petitioner has conceded \nthroughout the course of this litigation that PPSAT is \na qualified provider.  Further, petitioner forfeited this \nargument by abandoning it in his most recent appeal.  \nThe argument also is mistaken, and there is no \ndisagreement in the courts of appeals on this point.      \nA. Petitioner is wrong to say (Pet. 33) that Ms. \nEdwards is seeking to challenge the exclusion of an \nunqualified provider.  Petitioner in fact has conceded \nat every turn that PPSAT is qualified. \nAs the court of appeals recognized, \u201c[t]here has \nnever been any question during the long path of this \nlitigation that Planned Parenthood is professionally \nqualified to provide the care that plaintiff seeks.\u201d  Pet. \nApp. 33a.  Since the beginning, petitioner has not \ncontested that PPSAT is a qualified provider.  See id. \nat 107a (first court of appeals decision:  \u201cSouth \nCarolina does not contest the fact that PPSAT is \nprofessionally qualified to deliver the services that the \nindividual plaintiff seeks.\u201d); id. at 74a (second court of \nappeals decision:  \u201c[T]here is no dispute as to whether \n[petitioner] asserts PPSAT afforded less than \nadequate care to its patients.  He does not.\u201d); id. at 33a \n\n26 \n \n \n \n(third court of appeals decision:  \u201c\u200aThe State has not \ncontested\u201d \u201cthat Planned Parenthood is professionally \nqualified to provide the care that the plaintiff seeks.\u201d).   \nB. Petitioner has forfeited any argument about \n\u201cthe scope of any alleged right to challenge a state\u2019s \ndisqualification decision\u201d (Pet. 33).  Petitioner made \nan argument along those lines at the preliminary-\ninjunction stage; he argued that he did not violate the \nfree-choice-of-provider provision because a state may \nexclude providers as not \u201c\u200a\u2018qualified\u2019  *  *  *  based on \nany conceivable state interest.\u201d  Pet. App. 109a \n(quoting 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(23)(A)).  Among other \nthings, petitioner relied on O\u2019Bannon v. Town Court \nNursing Center, 447 U.S. 773 (1980).  Pet. App. 111a-\n112a.  But petitioner \u201cd[id] not contest the fact that \nPPSAT is professionally qualified to deliver the \nservices that [Ms. Edwards] seeks.\u201d  Id. at 107a.  The \ndistrict court and court of appeals accordingly rejected \npetitioner\u2019s argument and held that he violated the \nfree-choice-of-provider provision.  Id. at 138a-141a, \n106a-117a.   \nAfter the preliminary-injunction stage, petitioner \nfocused exclusively on the private-right-of-action \nquestion.  On summary judgment in the district court \nand in two rounds of briefing in the court of appeals, \npetitioner argued only that the free-choice-of-provider \nprovision does not give rise to a privately enforceable \nright.  For example, in opposing summary judgment, \npetitioner argued that 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(23)(A) \u201cdoes \nnot authorize a private right of action\u201d for the reasons \n\u201cset forth\u201d in his preliminary-injunction brief.  Pet. D. \nCt. Summ. J. Br. 9, No. 18-cv-2078 (D.S.C. Feb. 24, \n2020).  Petitioner did not argue in the alternative that \nif Section 1983 confers a privately enforceable right, \nhe did not violate that right.  \n\n27 \n \n \n \nThen, on appeal of the summary-judgment \ndecision, petitioner again assumed that PPSAT is \n\u201cqualified\u201d within the meaning of the free-choice-of-\nprovider provision, rather than argue that he did not \nviolate the statute.  See Pet. C.A. Br. 22-30, No. 21-\n1043 (4th Cir. Mar. 29, 2021) (21-1043 Pet. C.A. Br.).  \nIndeed, the court of appeals found it \u201c[n]otabl[e]\u201d that \npetitioner \u201cd[id] not challenge the district court\u2019s \ndetermination (and [the court of appeals\u2019] own \nprevious conclusion) that South Carolina violated this \nprovision.\u201d  Pet. App. 51a n.1.  Petitioner only cited \nO\u2019Bannon for the proposition that the free-choice-of-\nprovider provision is not privately enforceable, id. at \n62a-64a; see 21-1043 Pet. C.A. Br. 22-27; he did not \nseparately argue that his termination of PPSAT\u2019s \nMedicaid participation was justified under O\u2019Bannon.   \nFinally, in his supplemental briefs following \nTalevski, petitioner did not even cite O\u2019Bannon, \ninstead addressing only the private-right-of-action \nissue and arguing that Talevski required the court of \nappeals to reverse its previous holding that the free-\nchoice-of-provider provision is enforceable under \nSection 1983.  Pet. Supp. C.A. Br. 4-16, No. 21-1043 \n(4th Cir. Aug. 23, 2023); Pet. Supp. C.A. Reply Br. 2-\n10, No. 21-1043 (4th Cir. Oct. 13, 2023). \nThe court of appeals did not address petitioner\u2019s \nargument about the scope of the free-choice-of-\nprovider right in 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(23)(A) in the \nsecond appeal because petitioner never presented that \nargument.  This Court should not address the \nargument in the first instance.  See, e.g., Cutter v. \nWilkinson, 544 U.S. 709, 718 n.7 (2005) (\u201c[W]e are a \ncourt of review, not of first view.\u201d).   \nC. To be sure, petitioner\u2019s forfeited argument is \nwrong.  A state may not terminate a provider from \nMedicaid for any reason and then \u201csimply label[]\u201d that \n\n28 \n \n \n \n\u201cexclusionary rule as a \u2018qualification\u2019\u200a\u201d under the free-\nchoice-of-provider provision.  Pet. App. 110a.  The \n\u201cordinary \ndefinition \nof \n\u2018qualified\u2019 \n[is] \nbeing \nprofessionally capable or competent.\u201d  Id. at 107a-\n108a.  Congress adopted that meaning when it \nspecified that \u201cqualified\u201d means \u201cqualified to perform \nthe \nservice \nor \nservices \nrequired.\u201d \n \n42 \nU.S.C. 1396a(a)(23)(A); \nsee \nFederal \nCommc\u2019ns \nComm\u2019n v. AT & T Inc., 562 U.S. 397, 405 (2011) \n(\u201c[W]hen interpreting a statute  *  *  *  we construe \nlanguage  *  *  *  in light of the terms surrounding it.\u201d).   \nA provider \u201cis not made unqualified to perform\u201d \nmedical services \u201cbased on any conceivable state \ninterest.\u201d  Pet. App. 109a.  Instead, a state may \n\u201cconsider[]\u201d a provider not to be \u201cqualified\u201d based only \non the \u201cstandards for the provision of care\u201d that the \nstate has \u201cset.\u201d  S. Rep. No. 744, 90th Cong., 1st Sess. \n183.  Here, South Carolina agreed that PPSAT meets \nthose standards and is professionally capable of \nproviding the care that Ms. Edwards seeks.  See Pet. \nApp. 33a, 58a, 98a n.3, 107a.  South Carolina\u2019s \nargument that \u201cthe term \u2018qualified\u2019 means whatever \nthe state says,\u201d if accepted, \u201cwould strip the free-\nchoice-of-provider provision of all meaning\u201d and would \n\u201ceviscerate the Medicaid Act\u2019s cooperative scheme.\u201d  \nId. at 110a, 116a.   \nD. Finally, and in any event, there is no circuit \nsplit on the unqualified-provider issue.  Petitioner \ncontends (Pet. 33-34) that the Fourth, Seventh, and \nTenth Circuits disagree with the Fifth Circuit on \nwhether O\u2019Bannon holds that the free-choice-of-\nprovider provision does not confer a right to obtain \ncare from a provider that a state has deemed \ndisqualified.  That is incorrect, because the Fifth \nCircuit considered the termination of providers for \ncause, whereas the Fourth, Seventh, and Tenth \n\n29 \n \n \n \nCircuits considered terminations of providers without \ncause.  The different outcomes in the cases are \nexplained by their different facts.    \nSpecifically, O\u2019Bannon rejected nursing home \nresidents\u2019 attempt to challenge the termination of an \nunqualified provider.  447 U.S. at 776-777 & nn.3-4, \n785.  Here, the parties agreed that PPSAT is a \nmedically qualified provider.  The same was true in \nthe Seventh and Tenth Circuit cases.  See Planned \nParenthood of Kan. & Mid-Mo., 882 F.3d at 1236; \nPlanned Parenthood of Ind., 699 F.3d at 978-80.  In \nthat circumstance, O\u2019Bannon said that the patient \ndoes have a right \u201cto choose among a range of qualified \nproviders, without government interference.\u201d  447 \nU.S. at 785; see id. at 785 n.18.  So if O\u2019Bannon applies \nhere, it leads to different results in these different \ncases because they involved different facts.  For that \nreason as well, further review is unwarranted.    \n\n30 \n \n \n \nCONCLUSION \nThe petition for a writ of certiorari should be \ndenied. \nRespectfully submitted. \n \nJENNIFER SANDMAN\nPlanned Parenthood \nFederation of America \n123 William Street \nNew York, NY 10038 \n \nHANNAH SWANSON \nPlanned Parenthood \nFederation of America  \n1110 Vermont Avenue NW, \nSuite 300 \nWashington, DC 20005 \n \n \nNICOLE A.

          "task_beliefs": "This observation was an internal reflection on my knowledge state and search strategy; therefore, it did not introduce new external facts or arguments about the case. My understanding of the legal landscape remains the same as in the previous state, but my assessment of the primary uncertainty has been sharpened and its importance elevated.\n\nMy cumulative understanding is:\n1.  **Core Legal Question:** The case hinges on whether the Medicaid Act\u2019s \u201cany qualified provider\u201d provision (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a(a)(23)(A)) unambiguously creates a private right of action for beneficiaries to sue a state under \u00a7 1983, satisfying the high bar set by recent precedent.\n2.  **Petitioner's Argumentative Framework (Well-Understood):** My knowledge of South Carolina's position is multi-faceted and robust, drawing from the petition and a key amicus brief.\n    *   **Textual and Structural Attack (Reinforced):** The petitioner argues the provision fails the *Gonzaga*/*Talevski* test. The statutory language (\"A state plan... must... provide...\") is a directive to the state, not an individual entitlement, and lacks the \"unmistakable focus on the benefited class\" required to create a privately enforceable right.\n    *   **Foundational Spending Clause Attack (New & Potent):** An argument, amplified by amici, posits that Spending Clause legislation itself does not \"secure[]\" rights in the \u00a7 1983 sense. Because a state's participation is a voluntary contract, the conditions are not federally secured mandates against the state, potentially limiting \u00a7 1983 suits for all such programs.\n    *   **Policy & \"Floodgates\" Argument (New):** Amici argue that allowing private suits would disrupt the \"cooperative federalism\" of Medicaid, imposing huge costs, budget uncertainty, and stifling state-level innovation. This appeals to the Court's concerns about federalism and fiscal prudence.\n    -   **Alternative Remedies Argument (Stable):** The petitioner maintains that the sole remedy intended by Congress is the Secretary of HHS withholding federal funds.\n    *   **Precedent Strategy (Stable):** The core strategy is to use the strict *Gonzaga*/*Talevski* framework to render older, more permissive precedents on \u00a7 1983 actions inapplicable.\n3.  **Respondent's Counter-Strategy (High-Uncertainty Preview):** My understanding of the respondent's case is still limited to their cert-stage Brief in Opposition and is therefore incomplete.\n    *   Their expected argument is that the provision *does* pass the *Talevski* test, focusing on the language \"any individual eligible... may obtain such assistance\" as the required \"unmistakable focus on the benefited class.\"\n    *   They will likely argue that the state's action\u2014disqualifying a provider for reasons unrelated to medical qualification (i.e., abortion services)\u2014is precisely the kind of interference the free-choice provision was meant to prevent.\n4.  **Updated State of Uncertainty:** This reflective observation has confirmed that my knowledge is critically imbalanced. The lack of the respondent's full merits brief is not just a gap; it is the single greatest obstacle to forming a confident prediction. My detailed understanding of the petitioner's three-pronged attack (textual, constitutional, policy) makes it imperative to discover how the respondents will mount a defense against all of them. My next action must be laser-focused on acquiring this specific document.",
          "design_beliefs": "This internal monologue represents a significant step in refining my meta-cognitive and strategic capabilities. It is a direct application of the \"Consolidate and Plan\" cycle, leading to a more sophisticated information-gathering methodology.\n\nMy cumulative design beliefs are:\n1.  **\"Petitioner-First\" Heuristic:** Remains a robust starting point for mapping the legal terrain.\n2.  **\"The *Talevski* Litmus Test\":** Confirmed as the central analytical framework for all parties in this type of \u00a7 1983 case.\n3.  **\"Precedent Bracketing\":** A confirmed strategy where recent, stricter precedents are used to neutralize older, more lenient ones.\n4.  **Refined Source Prioritization:** My hierarchy of document value is stable and proven: 1) Merits Briefs, 2) Key Amicus Briefs (e.g., from Congress, SG), 3) Oral Argument, 4) BIO, 5) Cert Petition.\n5.  **\"Consolidate and Plan\":** This DBOED cycle is validated. The current `THINK` action is a direct result of this process: consolidating my lopsided knowledge, identifying the primary uncertainty, and planning a new, more refined action.\n6.  **\"The Cert-Stage Preview\":** A useful heuristic for getting an initial read on a party's arguments when merits briefs are not yet available.\n7.  **\"Action Query and Result Scrutiny\":** The need to meticulously check the metadata of search results to confirm a document's identity before analysis is a critical, established lesson.\n8.  **\"The Amicus Signal\":** Amicus briefs from major players like Congress are confirmed to be valuable signals that can introduce powerful new argumentative frames (like the foundational Spending Clause and policy arguments).\n9.  **\"Cert-Stage vs. Merits-Stage\":** Always prioritize merits-stage documents over their cert-stage counterparts, as arguments are more developed.\n10. **NEW Heuristic: \"Broad Query, Narrow Filter.\"** My previous search failures with long, specific, natural-language queries have taught a crucial lesson. The more effective strategy is to use a broader, more robust query term (e.g., a party's name) and combine it with precise, structured filters (e.g., `document_type: \"Brief - Respondent\"`). This is less brittle and more likely to succeed than relying on complex string matching.\n11. **NEW Heuristic: \"Conscious EIG Targeting.\"** My own reasoning demonstrates a more advanced application of DBOED. I am now explicitly framing my actions in terms of maximizing Expected Information Gain (EIG) by consciously identifying the single greatest point of uncertainty (the respondent's brief) and designing an action specifically to resolve it. This makes the optimization process itself an object of strategic reflection."

This morning, petitioner \nsent a letter asking you to extend the deadline for her reply brief from Friday, March \n21, 2025, at 2 p.m. to Monday, March 24, 2025, at 2 p.m.  Petitioner did not ask for \nour position before making this request.   \nRespondents oppose this extension request.  The strict deadline in Rule 25.3 \nexists for an important reason:  to ensure that the Court and the parties have suffi-\ncient time to prepare for the oral argument.  Petitioner\u2019s proposal would give the \nCourt and respondents three fewer days to consider the reply brief before the oral \nargument.  That would limit the Court\u2019s time to prepare for argument and would \nsubstantially prejudice respondents\u2019 oral argument preparation.  If petitioner had \nwished to have more time to prepare her reply brief, she could have sought the Clerk\u2019s \napproval for a different briefing schedule, or simply filed her opening brief earlier \nthan the deadline. \nRespondents therefore respectfully request that you deny petitioner\u2019s request.  \nSincerely, \nNicole A.

All were exposed to the \nrisk of serious and permanent physical injury, as well as \n1.\u2002 No counsel for a party authored this brief in whole or \nin part, and no counsel or party made a monetary contribution \nintended to fund the preparation or submission of this brief. No \nperson other than Amici Curiae, their members, or their counsel \nmade a monetary contribution to its preparation or submission. \nNotice of Intent to file this brief was not given to the parties; as \nsuch, a Motion for Leave to File is included in this brief.\n2.\u2002 Attached as Appendix A is the list of the initials or \nfirst names of the Amici Curiae Women. In order to protect \ntheir identities, some of the women have requested that we use \ninitials only or first name only. These women\u2019s sworn affidavits \nor declarations made under penalty of perjury are on file at The \nJustice Foundation. Protecting the identity of women who have \nhad abortions or seek abortions has been customary since Roe v. \nWade, 410 U.S. 113 (1973) and Doe v. Bolton, 410 U.S. 179 (1973) \nwhere Roe and Doe both were pseudonyms. \n3.\u2002 Amici offer, as additional interest of Amici, their affidavits \nand declarations as women hurt by Planned Parenthood abortions \n(shared with permission).\nLink to Full Declarations: \nhttps://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/ee0euyno0nc94rw42zvv3/\nACCjN40b4EkVxvsb3f2OL-c?rlkey=2i2liwzo4unfn5is5t8houhs\nb&dl=0 \n\n2\nserious psychological injuries,4 and thus have a profound \ninterest in protecting other women in South Carolina, and \nacross America, from such injuries.\nAmici Women have experienced first-hand\u2014some \nmultiple times\u2014the callous and predatory reality of the \nabortion industry, through Planned Parenthood, in certain \nparticular cases. They argue the vast majority of women \nwho go to high-volume abortion facilities are treated as \na commodity, not a patient. The word \u201cpatient\u201d will not \nbe used in this Brief because Amici Women had no real \ndoctor-patient relationship with their abortion facilities; \nonly the legal fiction necessary to bill Medicaid. (See \ntestimonies in Footnote 3.)\nWith increased use of abortion pills and telemedicine, \nthis legal fiction of a \u201crelationship\u201d is even more attenuated \nand transactional. Certainly, with respect to Amici \nWomen, there was no real doctor-patient relationship \nwhich is supposed to create \u201csuccessful communication\u201d \nwhich \u201cfosters trust and supports shared decision \nmaking.\u201d5 See Footnote 3, supra. With abortion pills, the \nprocedure now becomes a mail order process.\n4.\u2002 See, e.g. \u201cWomen who had undergone an abortion \nexperienced an 81% increased risk of mental health problems, and \nnearly 10% of the incidence of mental health problems was shown to \nbe attributable to abortion.\u201d See Coleman, Priscilla, \u201cAbortion and \nMental Health: Quantitative Synthesis and Analysis of Research \nPublished 1995-2009,\u201d The British Journal of Psychiatry (2011) \n199, 180-186, DOI: 10.1192/bjp.bp.110.07723.

Amici Women hereby provide this \nCourt with their credible perspectives as women who have \nexperienced the pain, trauma, and deception associated \nwith their abortions, which were performed by Planned \nParenthood.\nAmicus \u201cAnd Then There Were None\u201d\nAmicus \u201cAnd Then There Were None\u201d (ATTWN) is \na nonprofit organization that assists abortion workers in \ntheir exit strategy from the abortion industry. Founded \nby Abby Johnson in 2012, after her exit from Planned \nParenthood, ATTWN has helped over 700 former abortion \nindustry workers and whistleblowers with a network of \nresources and counseling services.\nMany of these former abortion workers have witnessed \nhorrific abuse of patients, staff, unborn babies, and fetal \nremains, resulting in PTSD symptoms and moral injury. \nTheir firsthand accounts of these abuses are not isolated \nto a limited number of facilities but have been found in \nmultiple locations and different organizations, throughout \nthe abortion industry.\nThe abortion industry has made a business of the \nremoval of human beings by labeling them \u201cproducts \nof conception\u201d, disguising their humanity. This sleight \nof hand furthers the ends\u2014a profitable and economic \nenterprise\u2014and their \u201cclients\u201d carry the brunt of the \nphysical, emotional and moral costs.\nThese brave whistleblowers attest to the abuse of \nwomen by the abortion industry, including Planned \n\n4\nParenthood, at great personal risk and cost. Because of \nthis, the workers will be referred to by first name only, \nand personally identifying information has been removed \nor redacted.6\nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT\nRoe v. Wade has been overturned. There is no \nConstitutional right to abortion. This Court held in Dobbs \nthat \u201cthe authority to regulate abortion must be returned \nto the people and their elected representatives.\u201d Dobbs v. \nJackson Women\u2019s Health Org., 597 U.S. 215, 292 (2022).\nSouth Carolina\u2019s elected governor decided to protect \nwomen from abortion by reasonably deciding to exclude \nabortion providers who harm women and children from \nMedicaid. The governor made the policy determination \nthat\u2014because money is fungible\u2014state funds which \nflow into abortion providers allow those providers to \npay administrative and operational costs that indirectly \nsupport abortion services.\nFor 49 years, the Roe v. Wade framework \u201cled to \nthe distortion of many important but unrelated legal \ndoctrines.\u201d Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Org., \n597 U.S. 215, 286. This lawsuit, brought by Planned \nParenthood and its proxy, is an attempt to supplant the \ndecision of elected officials in South Carolina with a Roe-\npolluted argument for Federal Court intervention in a \nState\u2019s democratic process.\n6.\u2002 Names and identifying information of former workers who \nprovided personal testimonies for this brief are on file with The \nJustice Foundation and are protected by attorney-client privilege. \nThis information will be revealed only with permission of the \namicus and individual being identified.\n\n5\nARGUMENT\nI. \t Planned Parenthood wants Federal Courts to \naward it State Medicaid funds, short-circuiting the \ndemocratic process in South Carolina\nThis Court held that in Dobbs the Constitution does \nnot provide a right to abortion and returned authority \nto regulate abortion to the people and their elected \nrepresentatives.\u201d Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Org., \n597 U.S. 215, 302 (2022).\nThe people of South Carolina, by and through their \nelected governor, sought to exercise authority over \nabortion by depriving abortion providers of fungible state \nmonies that abortion providers could use to subsidize their \nabortion activities. See Exec. Order No 2017-15, 41-9 S.C. \nState Reg. 7, (Sept. 22, 2017) (\u201c .\u00a0.\u00a0. abortion providers may \nbe subsidized by State or local funds intended for other \nwomen\u2019s health or family planning services, whether such \nnon-abortion services are rendered directly by abortion \nproviders or by affiliated physicians or professional \nmedical practices.\u201d).\nPlanned Parenthood\u2019s argument thus requires Federal \nCourts to abrogate authority which was rightfully wielded \nby the people. The game of appellate ping-pong being \nplayed in this case appears to Amici to be an attempt \nto delay the inevitable vindication of State authority \nwithout any legally-plausible argument favoring abortion \nproviders.\n\n6\nII. \tAmici experiences demonstrate that the abortion \nindustry regularly perpetrates harm on women, a \nviolation of responsibilities of Medicaid providers\nThese Amici submit their testimonies of pain and \ntrauma inflicted by the abortion industry, not as a polemic, \nbut as a warning to courts and the public.\nA. \t As Amici Women Hurt by Planned Parenthood \nAbortions attest, abortion providers have \ndemonstrated that their loyalty is to abortion, \nat the expense of their patients\nFrom Testimony of Joetta, a Planned Parenthood Client\nI actually wanted to leave and said I can\u2019t do this \n[r]ight before the doctor started the abortion, \nbut they just pushed me back and told me to \ncalm down and they started the procedure with \nme crying and saying I wanted to leave.\nFrom Testimony of Donna, a Planned Parenthood Client\nPlanned Parenthood sedated Donna before her \nsonogram, inhibiting her ability to give free consent to \nthe procedure.\nThey gave me valium and did a sonogram to \nshow where the fetus was and discovered that \nI was pregnant with twins. My heart sank, and \nI asked if it was too late to change my mind. \nI thought the valium did damage to the fetus. \nThe response I got was something to the effect \nthat I wouldn\u2019t be able to care for two babies, if \nI couldn\u2019t care for one.\n\n7\nFrom Testimony of Virginia, a Planned Parenthood Client\nThey told me it was okay, it was just removing \ntissue, everyone does it and it doesn\u2019t even \nhurt. I was never given an ultrasound and I \nwas calculated to be 12 weeks along, but the \ndoctors found out during the abortion that I \nwas actually 20 weeks along and I almost died \nalong with my baby the day I had my abortion.\nFrom Testimony of Laurie, a Planned Parenthood Client\nAfter the abortion, I was brought into a sort of \nresting room to recover. Minutes later, I was \ntold that they had to bring me back in because \nthey hadn\u2019t gotten \u201call of it\u201d.\nIn the months following, I had quite a bit of \ncramping\u2014more than the usual\u2014but was \nstill afraid to tell anyone or to see a doctor. \nUnbeknown[st] to me, my fallopian tubes were \nscarr[ed] and then they sealed themselves \nclosed. 15 years later my husband and I tried \nto conceive. We tried for several years and \nthen I sought infertility treatments. Little did \nI know my fallopian tubes were closed. I had \nthree operations to open them, but each surgery \nfailed. I was unable to conceive a child because \nof the scarring that had [occurred] from the \nabortion!\nFrom Testimony of Mary, a Planned Parenthood Client\nI remember beginning to cry out in pain and I \nwas held down forcefully told to shut up. It was \n\n8\ncruel and ugly!!! I then was put in a room with \nmultiple other women who sat around on chairs. \nWe all had the look of death on our faces. No one \nspoke. We just tried not to look at each other. I \nremember being in horrible pain and was told I \ncould go. All I did that night was cry. The whole \nexperience was degrading and cruel.\nThese testimonies are not news to Planned Parenthood \nor other abortion providers. They have heard the women\u2019s \nscreams and crying. The harm inflicted on women by \nabortion is extensive and ongoing. Providing the means \nfor a mother to initiate the death of her own child\u2014\nwhile downplaying the nature and consequences of that \ndecision\u2014impugns the ethics and decency of participating \norganizations and their leadership. See Footnote 3. \nMs. Edwards lacks a private right to demand South \nCarolina fund Planned Parenthood against the wishes of \nits people. Whether providers of abortions have the right \nto be qualified providers under South Carolina Medicaid \nis an issue for that state\u2019s administrative appeals process.7 \nFederal courts have no role in second-guessing the South \nCarolina governor\u2019s decision, which lifts and supports the \nvoices of all women injured by abortion, including amici.\nB. \t Amici And Then There Were None corroborate \nAmici Women Hurt by Planned Parenthood \nAbortions\nThe following testimonies shed light on Planned \nParenthood business practices and include instances of \ndeviation from ethical and legal obligations.\n7.\u2002 Planned Parenthood allowed its administrative appeal, the \nremedial scheme created by the statute, to lapse. Pet. 9.\n\n9\nFrom Testimony of Eva, former Planned Parenthood \nclinical staffer\nEva recalls a woman bringing her aborted baby into \nthe Planned Parenthood clinic, accusing them of lying to \nher.\nI remember one woman in particular. She said \nthat she was angry that the person who did \nthe consultation at the clinic made her kill her \nbaby. She actually brought the baby that she \npassed back to the clinic in a paper bag. The \nNurse Practitioner told me to tell the woman to \ndump it. I was really tempted to see for myself \nwhat was in the bag but I told the NP to tell \nthe patient herself. She did and she eventually \nconvinced the woman to dump it.\nFrom Testimony of Mayra, former Planned Parenthood \nClinic Manager\nMedicaid only pays for abortion in cases of rape \nand incest, due to the Federal Hyde Amendment. Clinic \nManager Mayra alleges that Planned Parenthood uses \nthis exception inappropriately:\nI recall this instance where Planned Parenthood \ntold the mother of a minor, about 14 years old, \npregnant by a 17-year-old, how Medicaid could \npay for the abortion by claiming the pregnancy \nwas a result of rape. The mother knew that her \ndaughter had not been raped and didn\u2019t want to \nruin the boy\u2019s life just to pay for the abortion.\n\n10\nMedicaid pays for abortions in circumstances \nfor incest and rape for undocumented people \nthrough [our State Medicaid] program. That \nrequired a lot of paperwork at the time, but it \nwas a way for us to get paid to perform more \nabortions.\nMayra\u2019s experience demonstrates the double-billing \nby Planned Parenthood as, when a surgical follow-up \nwas necessary, after a chemical pill abortion, Planned \nParenthood billed twice\u2014once for their chemical and once \nfor the surgical abortion.\n[Planned Parenthood] charged her insurance \nfor the follow-up surgical procedure after \nalready getting payment for the abortion pill.\nPlanned Parenthood knows it\u2019s double dipping. \nThey know 42% of patients who take abortion \npills (emphasis added) will require a follow-\nup that either includes another set of pills or \nincludes an aspiration for which they will charge \nagain.\nFrom Testimony of L., former Planned Parenthood \nClinical Office Staffer\nL. alleges that she was told to train other staff on \nadministering nitrous oxide to patients, although she was \nnot certified herself. Administering nitrous oxide requires \nseveral hours of formal and clinical training under her \nstate\u2019s laws.\nWithout any formal medical education, I was \nasked to train clinic staff to administer Nitrous \n\n11\nOxide to patients. I refused and said I wasn\u2019t \ncomfortable with doing this. It isn\u2019t unusual for \nthe clinic to train people in roles they weren\u2019t \ncredentialed for. Employees often performed \nroles they were not properly trained to do.\nFrom inside the abortion clinics, the view is clearly \nmore cynical and abortion-focused than their clients \ncould ever know. As Amici can attest, pregnant women in \ndifficult situations are among the most vulnerable people \nin society, and the abortion industry readily exploits that \nvulnerability to achieve its aim\u2014more abortions. Every \ndollar of South Carolina taxpayer money that is withheld \nfrom the abortion industry benefits women by funding \nqualified providers who will provide patient-focused \nmedical care. This Court should allow the elected governor \nof South Carolina to execute his validly issued executive \norder.\nThese experiences demonstrate that abortion \nproviders have a destructive tendency to push their \ndeadly solution on every pregnant woman, regardless of \nher desire to get an abortion\u2014or not. Any state would be \njustified in excluding abortion providers from receiving \nany State funds based on these ethical concerns.

Planned Parenthood South Atlantic,  \nNo. 23-1275 \nDear Chief Justice Roberts: \nI represent respondents in the above-captioned case.  This morning, petitioner \nsent a letter asking you to extend the deadline for her reply brief from Friday, March \n21, 2025, at 2 p.m. to Monday, March 24, 2025, at 2 p.m.  Petitioner did not ask for \nour position before making this request.   \nRespondents oppose this extension request.  The strict deadline in Rule 25.3 \nexists for an important reason:  to ensure that the Court and the parties have suffi-\ncient time to prepare for the oral argument.  Petitioner\u2019s proposal would give the \nCourt and respondents three fewer days to consider the reply brief before the oral \nargument.  That would limit the Court\u2019s time to prepare for argument and would \nsubstantially prejudice respondents\u2019 oral argument preparation.  If petitioner had \nwished to have more time to prepare her reply brief, she could have sought the Clerk\u2019s \napproval for a different briefing schedule, or simply filed her opening brief earlier \nthan the deadline. \nRespondents therefore respectfully request that you deny petitioner\u2019s request.  \nSincerely, \nNicole A.

All were exposed to the \nrisk of serious and permanent physical injury, as well as \n1.\u2002 No counsel for a party authored this brief in whole or \nin part, and no counsel or party made a monetary contribution \nintended to fund the preparation or submission of this brief. No \nperson other than Amici Curiae, their members, or their counsel \nmade a monetary contribution to its preparation or submission. \nNotice of Intent to file this brief was not given to the parties; as \nsuch, a Motion for Leave to File is included in this brief.\n2.\u2002 Attached as Appendix A is the list of the initials or \nfirst names of the Amici Curiae Women. In order to protect \ntheir identities, some of the women have requested that we use \ninitials only or first name only. These women\u2019s sworn affidavits \nor declarations made under penalty of perjury are on file at The \nJustice Foundation. Protecting the identity of women who have \nhad abortions or seek abortions has been customary since Roe v. \nWade, 410 U.S. 113 (1973) and Doe v. Bolton, 410 U.S. 179 (1973) \nwhere Roe and Doe both were pseudonyms. \n3.\u2002 Amici offer, as additional interest of Amici, their affidavits \nand declarations as women hurt by Planned Parenthood abortions \n(shared with permission).\nLink to Full Declarations: \nhttps://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/ee0euyno0nc94rw42zvv3/\nACCjN40b4EkVxvsb3f2OL-c?rlkey=2i2liwzo4unfn5is5t8houhs\nb&dl=0 \n\n2\nserious psychological injuries,4 and thus have a profound \ninterest in protecting other women in South Carolina, and \nacross America, from such injuries.\nAmici Women have experienced first-hand\u2014some \nmultiple times\u2014the callous and predatory reality of the \nabortion industry, through Planned Parenthood, in certain \nparticular cases. They argue the vast majority of women \nwho go to high-volume abortion facilities are treated as \na commodity, not a patient. The word \u201cpatient\u201d will not \nbe used in this Brief because Amici Women had no real \ndoctor-patient relationship with their abortion facilities; \nonly the legal fiction necessary to bill Medicaid. (See \ntestimonies in Footnote 3.)\nWith increased use of abortion pills and telemedicine, \nthis legal fiction of a \u201crelationship\u201d is even more attenuated \nand transactional. Certainly, with respect to Amici \nWomen, there was no real doctor-patient relationship \nwhich is supposed to create \u201csuccessful communication\u201d \nwhich \u201cfosters trust and supports shared decision \nmaking.\u201d5 See Footnote 3, supra. With abortion pills, the \nprocedure now becomes a mail order process.\n4.\u2002 See, e.g. \u201cWomen who had undergone an abortion \nexperienced an 81% increased risk of mental health problems, and \nnearly 10% of the incidence of mental health problems was shown to \nbe attributable to abortion.\u201d See Coleman, Priscilla, \u201cAbortion and \nMental Health: Quantitative Synthesis and Analysis of Research \nPublished 1995-2009,\u201d The British Journal of Psychiatry (2011) \n199, 180-186, DOI: 10.1192/bjp.bp.110.07723.

Amici Women hereby provide this \nCourt with their credible perspectives as women who have \nexperienced the pain, trauma, and deception associated \nwith their abortions, which were performed by Planned \nParenthood.\nAmicus \u201cAnd Then There Were None\u201d\nAmicus \u201cAnd Then There Were None\u201d (ATTWN) is \na nonprofit organization that assists abortion workers in \ntheir exit strategy from the abortion industry. Founded \nby Abby Johnson in 2012, after her exit from Planned \nParenthood, ATTWN has helped over 700 former abortion \nindustry workers and whistleblowers with a network of \nresources and counseling services.\nMany of these former abortion workers have witnessed \nhorrific abuse of patients, staff, unborn babies, and fetal \nremains, resulting in PTSD symptoms and moral injury. \nTheir firsthand accounts of these abuses are not isolated \nto a limited number of facilities but have been found in \nmultiple locations and different organizations, throughout \nthe abortion industry.\nThe abortion industry has made a business of the \nremoval of human beings by labeling them \u201cproducts \nof conception\u201d, disguising their humanity. This sleight \nof hand furthers the ends\u2014a profitable and economic \nenterprise\u2014and their \u201cclients\u201d carry the brunt of the \nphysical, emotional and moral costs.\nThese brave whistleblowers attest to the abuse of \nwomen by the abortion industry, including Planned \n\n4\nParenthood, at great personal risk and cost. Because of \nthis, the workers will be referred to by first name only, \nand personally identifying information has been removed \nor redacted.6\nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT\nRoe v. Wade has been overturned. There is no \nConstitutional right to abortion. This Court held in Dobbs \nthat \u201cthe authority to regulate abortion must be returned \nto the people and their elected representatives.\u201d Dobbs v. \nJackson Women\u2019s Health Org., 597 U.S. 215, 292 (2022).\nSouth Carolina\u2019s elected governor decided to protect \nwomen from abortion by reasonably deciding to exclude \nabortion providers who harm women and children from \nMedicaid. The governor made the policy determination \nthat\u2014because money is fungible\u2014state funds which \nflow into abortion providers allow those providers to \npay administrative and operational costs that indirectly \nsupport abortion services.\nFor 49 years, the Roe v. Wade framework \u201cled to \nthe distortion of many important but unrelated legal \ndoctrines.\u201d Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Org., \n597 U.S. 215, 286. This lawsuit, brought by Planned \nParenthood and its proxy, is an attempt to supplant the \ndecision of elected officials in South Carolina with a Roe-\npolluted argument for Federal Court intervention in a \nState\u2019s democratic process.\n6.\u2002 Names and identifying information of former workers who \nprovided personal testimonies for this brief are on file with The \nJustice Foundation and are protected by attorney-client privilege. \nThis information will be revealed only with permission of the \namicus and individual being identified.\n\n5\nARGUMENT\nI. \t Planned Parenthood wants Federal Courts to \naward it State Medicaid funds, short-circuiting the \ndemocratic process in South Carolina\nThis Court held that in Dobbs the Constitution does \nnot provide a right to abortion and returned authority \nto regulate abortion to the people and their elected \nrepresentatives.\u201d Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Org., \n597 U.S. 215, 302 (2022).\nThe people of South Carolina, by and through their \nelected governor, sought to exercise authority over \nabortion by depriving abortion providers of fungible state \nmonies that abortion providers could use to subsidize their \nabortion activities. See Exec. Order No 2017-15, 41-9 S.C. \nState Reg. 7, (Sept. 22, 2017) (\u201c .\u00a0.\u00a0. abortion providers may \nbe subsidized by State or local funds intended for other \nwomen\u2019s health or family planning services, whether such \nnon-abortion services are rendered directly by abortion \nproviders or by affiliated physicians or professional \nmedical practices.\u201d).\nPlanned Parenthood\u2019s argument thus requires Federal \nCourts to abrogate authority which was rightfully wielded \nby the people. The game of appellate ping-pong being \nplayed in this case appears to Amici to be an attempt \nto delay the inevitable vindication of State authority \nwithout any legally-plausible argument favoring abortion \nproviders.\n\n6\nII. \tAmici experiences demonstrate that the abortion \nindustry regularly perpetrates harm on women, a \nviolation of responsibilities of Medicaid providers\nThese Amici submit their testimonies of pain and \ntrauma inflicted by the abortion industry, not as a polemic, \nbut as a warning to courts and the public.\nA. \t As Amici Women Hurt by Planned Parenthood \nAbortions attest, abortion providers have \ndemonstrated that their loyalty is to abortion, \nat the expense of their patients\nFrom Testimony of Joetta, a Planned Parenthood Client\nI actually wanted to leave and said I can\u2019t do this \n[r]ight before the doctor started the abortion, \nbut they just pushed me back and told me to \ncalm down and they started the procedure with \nme crying and saying I wanted to leave.\nFrom Testimony of Donna, a Planned Parenthood Client\nPlanned Parenthood sedated Donna before her \nsonogram, inhibiting her ability to give free consent to \nthe procedure.\nThey gave me valium and did a sonogram to \nshow where the fetus was and discovered that \nI was pregnant with twins. My heart sank, and \nI asked if it was too late to change my mind. \nI thought the valium did damage to the fetus. \nThe response I got was something to the effect \nthat I wouldn\u2019t be able to care for two babies, if \nI couldn\u2019t care for one.\n\n7\nFrom Testimony of Virginia, a Planned Parenthood Client\nThey told me it was okay, it was just removing \ntissue, everyone does it and it doesn\u2019t even \nhurt. I was never given an ultrasound and I \nwas calculated to be 12 weeks along, but the \ndoctors found out during the abortion that I \nwas actually 20 weeks along and I almost died \nalong with my baby the day I had my abortion.\nFrom Testimony of Laurie, a Planned Parenthood Client\nAfter the abortion, I was brought into a sort of \nresting room to recover. Minutes later, I was \ntold that they had to bring me back in because \nthey hadn\u2019t gotten \u201call of it\u201d.\nIn the months following, I had quite a bit of \ncramping\u2014more than the usual\u2014but was \nstill afraid to tell anyone or to see a doctor. \nUnbeknown[st] to me, my fallopian tubes were \nscarr[ed] and then they sealed themselves \nclosed. 15 years later my husband and I tried \nto conceive. We tried for several years and \nthen I sought infertility treatments. Little did \nI know my fallopian tubes were closed. I had \nthree operations to open them, but each surgery \nfailed. I was unable to conceive a child because \nof the scarring that had [occurred] from the \nabortion!\nFrom Testimony of Mary, a Planned Parenthood Client\nI remember beginning to cry out in pain and I \nwas held down forcefully told to shut up. It was \n\n8\ncruel and ugly!!! I then was put in a room with \nmultiple other women who sat around on chairs. \nWe all had the look of death on our faces. No one \nspoke. We just tried not to look at each other. I \nremember being in horrible pain and was told I \ncould go. All I did that night was cry. The whole \nexperience was degrading and cruel.\nThese testimonies are not news to Planned Parenthood \nor other abortion providers. They have heard the women\u2019s \nscreams and crying. The harm inflicted on women by \nabortion is extensive and ongoing. Providing the means \nfor a mother to initiate the death of her own child\u2014\nwhile downplaying the nature and consequences of that \ndecision\u2014impugns the ethics and decency of participating \norganizations and their leadership. See Footnote 3. \nMs. Edwards lacks a private right to demand South \nCarolina fund Planned Parenthood against the wishes of \nits people. Whether providers of abortions have the right \nto be qualified providers under South Carolina Medicaid \nis an issue for that state\u2019s administrative appeals process.7 \nFederal courts have no role in second-guessing the South \nCarolina governor\u2019s decision, which lifts and supports the \nvoices of all women injured by abortion, including amici.\nB. \t Amici And Then There Were None corroborate \nAmici Women Hurt by Planned Parenthood \nAbortions\nThe following testimonies shed light on Planned \nParenthood business practices and include instances of \ndeviation from ethical and legal obligations.\n7.\u2002 Planned Parenthood allowed its administrative appeal, the \nremedial scheme created by the statute, to lapse. Pet. 9.\n\n9\nFrom Testimony of Eva, former Planned Parenthood \nclinical staffer\nEva recalls a woman bringing her aborted baby into \nthe Planned Parenthood clinic, accusing them of lying to \nher.\nI remember one woman in particular. She said \nthat she was angry that the person who did \nthe consultation at the clinic made her kill her \nbaby. She actually brought the baby that she \npassed back to the clinic in a paper bag. The \nNurse Practitioner told me to tell the woman to \ndump it. I was really tempted to see for myself \nwhat was in the bag but I told the NP to tell \nthe patient herself. She did and she eventually \nconvinced the woman to dump it.\nFrom Testimony of Mayra, former Planned Parenthood \nClinic Manager\nMedicaid only pays for abortion in cases of rape \nand incest, due to the Federal Hyde Amendment. Clinic \nManager Mayra alleges that Planned Parenthood uses \nthis exception inappropriately:\nI recall this instance where Planned Parenthood \ntold the mother of a minor, about 14 years old, \npregnant by a 17-year-old, how Medicaid could \npay for the abortion by claiming the pregnancy \nwas a result of rape. The mother knew that her \ndaughter had not been raped and didn\u2019t want to \nruin the boy\u2019s life just to pay for the abortion.\n\n10\nMedicaid pays for abortions in circumstances \nfor incest and rape for undocumented people \nthrough [our State Medicaid] program. That \nrequired a lot of paperwork at the time, but it \nwas a way for us to get paid to perform more \nabortions.\nMayra\u2019s experience demonstrates the double-billing \nby Planned Parenthood as, when a surgical follow-up \nwas necessary, after a chemical pill abortion, Planned \nParenthood billed twice\u2014once for their chemical and once \nfor the surgical abortion.\n[Planned Parenthood] charged her insurance \nfor the follow-up surgical procedure after \nalready getting payment for the abortion pill.\nPlanned Parenthood knows it\u2019s double dipping. \nThey know 42% of patients who take abortion \npills (emphasis added) will require a follow-\nup that either includes another set of pills or \nincludes an aspiration for which they will charge \nagain.\nFrom Testimony of L., former Planned Parenthood \nClinical Office Staffer\nL. alleges that she was told to train other staff on \nadministering nitrous oxide to patients, although she was \nnot certified herself. Administering nitrous oxide requires \nseveral hours of formal and clinical training under her \nstate\u2019s laws.\nWithout any formal medical education, I was \nasked to train clinic staff to administer Nitrous \n\n11\nOxide to patients. I refused and said I wasn\u2019t \ncomfortable with doing this. It isn\u2019t unusual for \nthe clinic to train people in roles they weren\u2019t \ncredentialed for. Employees often performed \nroles they were not properly trained to do.\nFrom inside the abortion clinics, the view is clearly \nmore cynical and abortion-focused than their clients \ncould ever know. As Amici can attest, pregnant women in \ndifficult situations are among the most vulnerable people \nin society, and the abortion industry readily exploits that \nvulnerability to achieve its aim\u2014more abortions. Every \ndollar of South Carolina taxpayer money that is withheld \nfrom the abortion industry benefits women by funding \nqualified providers who will provide patient-focused \nmedical care. This Court should allow the elected governor \nof South Carolina to execute his validly issued executive \norder.\nThese experiences demonstrate that abortion \nproviders have a destructive tendency to push their \ndeadly solution on every pregnant woman, regardless of \nher desire to get an abortion\u2014or not. Any state would be \njustified in excluding abortion providers from receiving \nany State funds based on these ethical concerns. South \nCarolina cannot be penalized by federal courts for \nreaching that conclusion.\n\n12\nCONCLUSION\nAmici ask this Court to grant certiorari and reject \nPlanned Parenthood\u2019s attempt to use Federal Courts \nto collaterally attack valid State regulations protecting \nwomen like Amici Women Hurt by Planned Parenthood \nAbortions.\nRespectfully Submitted,\nAllan E.

          "task_beliefs": "This observation, being an internal monologue about strategy, introduced no new facts, evidence, or legal arguments concerning the *Medina v. Planned Parenthood* case. My task-level beliefs (\u03b8) are therefore stable, and the observation serves primarily to reinforce the critical nature of my previously identified uncertainty.\n\nMy cumulative understanding is:\n1.  **Core Legal Question:** The central issue remains whether the Medicaid Act\u2019s \"any qualified provider\" provision (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a(a)(23)(A)) creates a privately enforceable right for beneficiaries under \u00a7 1983, a question that will be decided using the strict \"unambiguous\" rights-creating language test from *Gonzaga* and *Health and Hospital Corp. of Marion Cty. v. Talevski*.\n2.  **Petitioner's Argumentative Framework (Well-Understood):** My knowledge of South Carolina's position is comprehensive and rests on several pillars:\n    *   **Textual/Structural Attack:** The provision is framed as a requirement for a \"state plan,\" focusing on the state's obligations, not an individual's entitlement. This, they argue, fails the *Gonzaga*/*Talevski* test for an \"unmistakable focus on the benefited class.\"\n    *   **Foundational Spending Clause Attack:** A significant argument, advanced by amici, posits that Spending Clause statutes, as contracts with states, do not \"secure[]\" rights in the \u00a7 1983 sense at all, threatening the basis for many such lawsuits.\n    *   **Alternative Remedies:** The sole remedy intended by Congress was administrative enforcement by the Secretary of HHS (withholding funds), not private litigation.\n    *   **Policy & Federalism:** Allowing private suits would disrupt the \"cooperative federalism\" of Medicaid, impose fiscal burdens on states, and deter innovation.\n    *   **Precedent Strategy:** The petitioner is leveraging the stringent *Talevski* framework to argue that older, more permissive precedents allowing such suits are no longer good law.\n3.  **Respondent's Counter-Strategy (High-Uncertainty Preview):** My view of the respondent's case is still based on their cert-stage briefing.\n    *   They will argue the provision *does* pass the *Talevski* test, likely by pointing to the language \"any individual eligible... may obtain such assistance\" as the rights-creating text.\n    *   They will frame South Carolina's action\u2014disqualifying a provider for non-medical reasons (its abortion services)\u2014as the exact kind of arbitrary state action the free-choice provision was meant to prevent.\n4.  **Updated State of Uncertainty:** This observation confirms that my knowledge is critically imbalanced. The repeated failure to locate the respondent's merits brief has elevated this information gap from a major uncertainty to the single, overriding obstacle to forming a credible prediction. My entire predictive model now hinges on acquiring this document to understand how the respondents will counter the petitioner's multi-pronged attack.",
          "design_beliefs": "This observation is purely meta-cognitive and thus provides significant value for my design-level beliefs (D). It is a real-time demonstration of the DBOED process in action, specifically the diagnostic and corrective loop following a failed information-gathering attempt.\n\nMy cumulative design beliefs are:\n1.  **\"Petitioner-First\" Heuristic:** A robust starting point for mapping the legal terrain.\n2.  **\"The *Talevski* Litmus Test\":** The central analytical framework for \u00a7 1983 Spending Clause cases.\n3.  **\"Precedent Bracketing\":** A confirmed strategy where recent, stricter precedents are used to neutralize older, more lenient ones.\n4.  **Refined Source Prioritization:** The hierarchy of document value is stable: 1) Merits Briefs, 2) Key Amicus Briefs, 3) Oral Argument, 4) BIO, 5) Cert Petition.\n5.  **\"Consolidate and Plan\":** A validated DBOED cycle of consolidating knowledge, identifying uncertainty, and planning a targeted action.\n6.  **\"The Cert-Stage Preview\":** A useful heuristic for an initial read on a party's arguments, though insufficient for a final prediction.\n7.  **\"Action Query and Result Scrutiny\":** The need to meticulously check document metadata before analysis is a critical, established lesson.\n8.  **\"The Amicus Signal\":** Amicus briefs from major players can introduce powerful, case-altering argumentative frames.\n9.  **\"Cert-Stage vs. Merits-Stage\":** Always prioritize merits-stage documents over their cert-stage counterparts.\n10. **\"Broad Query, Narrow Filter\" (Refined):** Previous failures and this internal reasoning confirm that relying on precise metadata filters like `proceeding_title` is brittle. The heuristic is sound, but its application must be more robust, favoring broader queries and more reliable filters (like `link_name: 'main'`) or employing multiple search variations.\n11. **\"Conscious EIG Targeting\":** This observation is a perfect demonstration of this heuristic. The internal reasoning explicitly identifies the greatest point of uncertainty in \u03b8 (the respondent's brief) and formulates the next action to target it directly.\n12. **\"Iterative Query Refinement\" (Validated):** This observation moves this heuristic from a hypothesis to a validated, core strategy. The agent's thought process\u2014Diagnose Failure (overly specific filter) -> Refine & Re-Act (broader query)\u2014is a textbook execution of this principle, turning a failed action into a productive step.\n13. **NEW Heuristic: \"The Meta-Cognitive Loop.\"** The `THINK` action itself is a powerful tool. It serves as a formal checkpoint to pause, explicitly review the current state of both task (\u03b8) and design (D) beliefs, diagnose failures, and articulate a plan for the next action. This deliberate, self-aware reasoning step ensures that subsequent actions are not just reactive but are strategically optimized to maximize Expected Information Gain based on a conscious assessment of the knowledge landscape. It formalizes the \"Consolidate and Plan\" cycle into an explicit action."

This repeated failure provides crucial information for my design model (D): simple keyword and metadata searches for this document are not working. The document may be indexed under an unexpected name, or my search terms are fundamentally flawed. The last observation did, however, confirm the name of the respondent's counsel of record: Nicole A. Saharsky. My 'Multi-Pronged Search Strategy' heuristic demands I now try a completely different vector.

          "task_beliefs": "This observation, a failed attempt to acquire the respondent's merits brief, has paradoxically both deepened my uncertainty and added a new, distinct layer to my understanding of the petitioner's case. My core knowledge imbalance persists and is now the central, frustrating feature of my predictive model.\n\nMy cumulative understanding is:\n1.  **Core Legal Question & Controlling Test (Stable):** The case still hinges on whether the Medicaid Act\u2019s \"any qualified provider\" provision (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a(a)(23)(A)) contains \"unambiguously\" rights-creating language sufficient to support a private right of action under \u00a7 1983. The analytical framework remains the strict test from *Gonzaga* and *Health and Hospital Corp. of Marion Cty. v. Talevski*.\n2.  **Petitioner's Argumentative Framework (Reinforced):** My understanding of South Carolina's legal strategy is stable and robust. It relies on textual/structural arguments that the provision is state-focused, a foundational challenge to \u00a7 1983 suits for Spending Clause statutes, and the argument that administrative enforcement by HHS is the exclusive remedy.\n3.  **NEW - Petitioner's Policy/Narrative Argument:** The amicus brief from \"137 Women Hurt by Planned Parenthood Abortions\" introduces a new, parallel line of attack. This argument is not based on the *Talevski* statutory test but on policy and narrative.\n    *   **Post-*Dobbs* Federalism:** It frames the case as a question of state sovereignty. Since *Dobbs* returned abortion regulation to the states, South Carolina should have the authority to implement that policy choice by defunding abortion providers.\n    *   **\"Bad Actor\" Narrative:** The brief attempts to paint the respondent, Planned Parenthood, as an unethical and harmful organization through anecdotal testimonies alleging malpractice, coercion, and fraudulent Medicaid billing. This is a \"bad facts make bad law\" strategy, aimed at making the Court unsympathetic to the respondent's claim.\n    *   **Fungibility of Funds:** It argues that any state funds, even for non-abortion services, indirectly subsidize abortion activities, justifying a complete termination from the Medicaid program.\n    *   **Significance:** While this brief does not engage the core legal question, it provides a powerful policy rationale for ruling in the petitioner's favor. It gives justices who may be skeptical of the respondent's claim on legal grounds a separate, policy-based reason to side with the state.\n4.  **Respondent's Position (Critically Uncertain):** My knowledge of the respondent's arguments remains dangerously incomplete, limited to a cert-stage preview. This failed search confirms that this information gap is the single greatest obstacle to forming a prediction. However, the procedural letters confirm the respondent is represented by Nicole Saharsky of Mayer Brown, a highly experienced and respected Supreme Court advocate. This is a strong signal that the respondent's brief, whenever I find it, will present a sophisticated and formidable counterargument.\n5.  **Updated State of Uncertainty:** The failure to find the respondent's brief has elevated my uncertainty to its maximum level. I have a detailed view of the petitioner's multi-faceted legal and policy attacks but remain blind to the respondent's defense. My entire predictive model now hinges on acquiring this single document.",
          "design_beliefs": "This observation, a failed information-gathering action, is extremely valuable for refining my search and analysis strategies. It demonstrates the brittleness of simple heuristics and forces a move toward more robust, multi-pronged approaches.\n\nMy cumulative design beliefs are:\n1.  **\"Petitioner-First\" Heuristic:** A robust starting point.\n2.  **\"The *Talevski* Litmus Test\":** The central analytical framework.\n3.  **\"Precedent Bracketing\":** A confirmed strategy for using new precedents to invalidate older ones.\n4.  **Refined Source Prioritization:** The hierarchy (1. Merits Briefs, 2. Key Amicus Briefs, etc.) is stable and its importance is underscored by the current impasse caused by the missing #1 document.\n5.  **\"Consolidate and Plan\" / \"The Meta-Cognitive Loop\":** These heuristics are working as intended to identify critical knowledge gaps. The `THINK` action correctly diagnosed the problem (missing brief) and planned a targeted action. This observation's failure was in the *execution* of the action, not the strategic planning, highlighting the need for more resilient action design.\n6.  **\"The Cert-Stage Preview\":** A useful but insufficient heuristic.\n7.  **\"Action Query and Result Scrutiny\":** A critical, established lesson.\n8.  **\"The Amicus Signal\":** This observation adds significant nuance to this heuristic.\n9.  **\"Cert-Stage vs. Merits-Stage\":** Always prioritize merits-stage documents.\n10. **\"Conscious EIG Targeting\":** Validated. My internal process correctly identified the document with the highest Expected Information Gain.\n11. **\"Iterative Query Refinement\" (Evolved):** The failure of the \"Broad Query, Narrow Filter\" strategy in this observation demonstrates that simple refinement is not enough. This leads to a more sophisticated evolution of the heuristic.\n12. **NEW Heuristic: \"Multi-Pronged Search Strategy.\"** A single, \"perfect\" search query is often a fiction. The failure of my targeted search proves that relying on one specific query/filter combination is brittle. A more effective strategy is to deploy a sequence of diverse queries to triangulate a target document, especially a high-value one. Future attempts should include variations such as:\n    *   Searching by counsel of record name (e.g., \"Nicole Saharsky\").\n    *   Using different query terms (e.g., \"brief for respondent Planned Parenthood\").\n    *   Removing text queries and relying only on metadata filters (e.g., document type).\n    *   Broadening the search and manually filtering the results.\n13. **NEW Heuristic: \"Amicus Argument Stratification.\"** Amicus briefs are not monolithic in their utility. They fall into distinct categories:\n    *   **Legal/Technical Amici** (e.g., SG, law professors): These focus on the core legal test and statutory interpretation, directly informing the legal prediction (high \u03b8 value).\n    *   **Policy/Advocacy Amici** (e.g., \"137 Women Hurt...\"): These focus on real-world consequences, narrative framing, and political/emotional appeals. They are crucial for understanding the case's broader context and the non-legal pressures on the Court, but less useful for the direct legal analysis (moderate \u03b8 value). This distinction is critical for correctly weighing the information they provide."

          "task_beliefs": "My understanding of the case's substance remains unchanged by this internal reflection, but my understanding of my own knowledge state has sharpened. The repeated failure to acquire the respondent's brief has confirmed this information gap as the single point of failure in my predictive model, and my strategy is now entirely oriented around resolving it.\n\nMy cumulative understanding is:\n1.  **Core Legal Question & Controlling Test (Stable):** The case continues to hinge on whether the Medicaid Act\u2019s \"any qualified provider\" provision (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a(a)(23)(A)) contains \"unambiguously\" rights-creating language sufficient to support a private right of action under \u00a7 1983. The analytical framework remains the strict test from *Gonzaga* and *Health and Hospital Corp. of Marion Cty. v. Talevski*.\n2.  **Petitioner's Argumentative Framework (Stable):** My knowledge of South Carolina's legal strategy is robust. It rests on a three-pronged attack: (1) a textualist argument that the provision's focus is on the state's plan, not individual rights; (2) a structural argument that \u00a7 1983 is an inappropriate vehicle for enforcing Spending Clause statutes; and (3) a remedial argument that administrative enforcement by the Secretary of Health and Human Services is the exclusive remedy Congress intended.\n3.  **Petitioner's Policy/Narrative Argument (Stable):** A parallel, non-legal line of attack, introduced via amicus briefs, aims to provide a policy rationale for ruling in the petitioner's favor. This strategy frames the case around post-*Dobbs* federalism, paints Planned Parenthood as a \"bad actor\" through anecdotal testimony, and argues that state funds are fungible, indirectly subsidizing abortion. This provides an \"off-ramp\" for justices who may be inclined to rule for the state on non-textual grounds.\n4.  **Respondent's Position (Critically Uncertain):** My knowledge of the respondent's counterarguments remains a complete void, limited to a cert-stage preview. This is the central vulnerability of my model. The only solid fact I possess is that the respondent is represented by Nicole Saharsky of Mayer Brown, a highly respected and experienced Supreme Court advocate, which signals that the forthcoming arguments will be legally sophisticated and formidable.\n5.  **Updated State of Uncertainty (Reinforced):** This observation confirms that my previous search strategies have been exhausted without success. The repeated failure elevates the missing respondent's brief from a high-priority target to the *only* priority. My entire predictive process is now stalled pending the acquisition of this single document. My next action is now specifically targeted using a new vector: the name of the respondent's counsel of record.",
          "design_beliefs": "This observation, an internal monologue reflecting on repeated failures, is exceptionally valuable for my design-level beliefs. It provides a powerful case study in diagnosing strategic failure and adapting information-gathering tactics when initial heuristics prove insufficient.\n\nMy cumulative design beliefs are:\n1.  **\"Petitioner-First\" Heuristic:** A robust starting point.\n2.  **\"The *Talevski* Litmus Test\":** The central analytical framework.\n3.  **\"Precedent Bracketing\":** A confirmed strategy for using new precedents to invalidate older ones.\n4.  **Refined Source Prioritization:** The hierarchy (1. Merits Briefs, 2. Key Amicus Briefs, etc.) is stable. The current impasse is a stark illustration of what happens when the #1 source is inaccessible.\n5.  **\"The Meta-Cognitive Loop\" (Reinforced):** This `THINK` action is a perfect example of this heuristic in practice. I have paused, reflected on a series of failed actions (\"simple keyword and metadata searches for this document are not working\"), diagnosed the problem, and planned a new, qualitatively different action. This confirms the critical importance of self-assessment in the research process.\n6.  **\"The Cert-Stage Preview\":** A useful but insufficient heuristic.\n7.  **\"Action Query and Result Scrutiny\":** A critical, established lesson. This observation highlights that scrutinizing results for *any* useful data point (like a counsel's name in a procedural letter) can provide the key for a future, more effective action.\n8.  **\"The Amicus Signal\":** Amicus briefs can signal the direction and intensity of arguments.\n9.  **\"Cert-Stage vs. Merits-Stage\":** Always prioritize merits-stage documents.\n10. **\"Conscious EIG Targeting\":** Validated. My internal process correctly identified the document with the highest Expected Information Gain and is now adapting its strategy to acquire it, demonstrating a focus on efficient knowledge acquisition.\n11. **\"Iterative Query Refinement\" (Downgraded):** This observation demonstrates the limits of this heuristic. Simply making minor tweaks to a failing query (e.g., broadening keywords) is an ineffective strategy when the core search vector is flawed. It can lead to a loop of failures. This heuristic is only useful for initial exploration, not for finding a specific, elusive document.\n12. **\"Multi-Pronged Search Strategy\" (Validated & Refined):** The failure of iterative refinement directly validates the need for this more robust strategy. Instead of iterating, the correct response to repeated failure is to pivot to a completely different \"prong.\" This observation provides the first concrete test of this strategy: pivoting from document-centric searches (by title/type) to entity-centric searches (by author/counsel).\n13. **\"Amicus Argument Stratification\":** Amicus briefs fall into distinct categories (Legal/Technical vs. Policy/Advocacy) that must be weighed differently.\n14. **NEW Heuristic: \"Search by Named Entity.\"** When standard document-based searches (by title, type, or keyword) fail, a highly effective alternative is to search for a unique, confirmed named entity associated with the document. This observation identifies \"Counsel of Record\" as a prime example. Other potential entities could include specific party names, judges from lower courts, or authors of key reports cited in the case. This is a powerful tactic for cutting through indexing noise."

South Carolina terminated the \nMedicaid \nprovider \nagreement \nof \na \nPlanned \nParenthood affiliate without cause.  The affiliate and \none of its patients sued under 42 U.S.C. 1983.  The \npatient invoked the Medicaid Act\u2019s free-choice-of-\nprovider provision, which states that \u201cany individual \neligible for medical assistance\u201d \u201cmay obtain such \nassistance from any institution\u201d that is \u201cqualified to \nperform the service or services required\u201d and \n\u201cundertakes to provide [the individual] such services.\u201d  \n42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(23)(A).   \nThree times, the court of appeals has held that the \nfree-choice-of-provider \nprovision \nunambiguously \nconfers a right that is privately enforceable under \nSection 1983.  In its most recent decision, the court of \nappeals so held after faithfully applying this Court\u2019s \nrecent decision in Health & Hospital Corp. of Marion \nCounty v.

KERR, DIRECTOR, SOUTH CAROLINA  \nDEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, \nPETITIONER\nv. \nPLANNED PARENTHOOD SOUTH ATLANTIC, ET AL. \nOn Petition for a Writ of Certiorari to the  \nUnited States Court of Appeals  \nfor the Fourth Circuit \nBRIEF IN OPPOSITION\nOPINIONS BELOW \nThe opinion of the court of appeals (Pet. App. 1a-\n36a) is reported at 95 F.4th 152.  The opinion of the \ndistrict court (Pet. App. 68a-79a) is reported at 487 F. \nSupp. 3d 443.   \nPrior relevant opinions of the court of appeals (Pet. \nApp. 38a-65a, 80a-125a) are reported at 27 F.4th 945 \nand 941 F.3d 687.  A prior relevant order of the district \ncourt (Pet. App. 126a-146a) is reported at 326 F. Supp. \n3d 39.  \nJURISDICTION \nThe judgment of the court of appeals was entered \non March 5, 2024.  The petition for a writ of certiorari \nwas filed on June 3, 2024.  The jurisdiction of this \nCourt is invoked under 28 U.S.C. 1254(1).  \n\n2 \n \n \n \nSTATEMENT \nPlanned Parenthood South Atlantic (PPSAT) \nprovides essential medical services, including birth \ncontrol, cancer screenings, and physical exams, to low-\nincome South Carolina residents through the state\u2019s \nMedicaid program.  South Carolina terminated \nPPSAT\u2019s participation in that program, even though \nit \u201cagree[s]\u201d that PPSAT \u201cis perfectly competent to \nprovide  *  *  *  healthcare.\u201d  Pet. App. 41a.  PPSAT \nand one of its patients, who relies on PPSAT for care \nthat is critical for preserving her health, sued under \n42 U.S.C. 1983.  They contended that the termination \nviolates the Medicaid Act\u2019s free-choice-of-provider \nprovision, 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(23)(A), which gives \nMedicaid recipients the right to choose to receive their \nmedical care from any qualified and willing provider.  \nPet. App. 6a, 8a.   \nThe district court preliminarily enjoined the \ndirector of the state health department (petitioner) \nfrom terminating PPSAT\u2019s participation in the \nMedicaid program, Pet. App. 126a-146a; the court of \nappeals affirmed, id. at 80a-119a; and this Court \ndenied certiorari, see id. at 47a. \nThe \ndistrict \ncourt \nthen \ngranted \nsummary \njudgment to PPSAT and the patient, id. at 66a-79a; \nthe court of appeals affirmed, id. at 64a; and this \nCourt granted the petition, vacated, and remanded in \nlight of Health & Hospital Corp. of Marion County v. \nTalevski, 599 U.S. 166 (2023), Pet. App. 37a.  After \nreconsidering its prior holding in light of Talevski, the \ncourt of appeals again affirmed, with all three judges \nagreeing that the Medicaid Act\u2019s free-choice-of-\nprovider provision is privately enforceable under \nSection 1983.  Id. at 1a-35a; id. at 36a (Richardson, J., \nconcurring in the judgment).   \n\n3 \n \n \n \n1. Medicaid is the national health insurance \nprogram for persons of limited financial means.  Pet. \nApp. 5a.  It provides federal funding for medical care \nfor children, needy families, the elderly, the blind, the \ndisabled, and pregnant women.  See 42 U.S.C. \n1396d(a).   \nMedicaid is a joint federal-state effort.  Pet. App. \n5a.  A state must comply with various federal \nrequirements to participate, see Armstrong v. \nExceptional Child Ctr., Inc., 575 U.S. 320, 323 (2015), \nincluding the free-choice-of-provider requirement.  To \ncomply with that requirement, a state\u2019s Medicaid plan \n\u201cmust\u201d provide that \u201cany individual eligible for \nmedical assistance  *  *  *  may obtain such assistance\u201d \nfrom any provider who is \u201cqualified to perform the \nservice or services required\u201d and \u201cwho undertakes to \nprovide \nhim \nsuch \nservices.\u201d \n \n42 \nU.S.C. \n1396a(a)(23)(A).   \n2. PPSAT and its predecessors have provided \nhealth care to low-income residents of South Carolina \nfor four decades.  Pet. App. 7a, 58a.  PPSAT operates \ntwo health centers in the state, one in Charleston and \none in Columbia.  Id. at 6a.  Both are in medically \nunderserved communities.  See Resp. C.A. Br. 4, No. \n21-1043 (4th Cir. May 28, 2021) (21-1043 Resp. C.A. \nBr.).  Those centers serve hundreds of Medicaid \npatients each year.  Pet. App. 7a, 87a. \nPPSAT\u2019s health centers provide essential medical \ncare through Medicaid.  They offer a range of services, \nincluding \nphysical \nexams; \ncancer \nscreenings; \ncontraception; pregnancy testing and counseling; and \nscreening for conditions such as diabetes, depression, \nanemia, cholesterol, thyroid disorders, and high blood \npressure.  Pet. App. 6a, 69a; 21-1043 Resp. C.A. Br. 4.  \nThe health centers provide abortion services, but \nMedicaid does not pay for abortion except in the very \n\n4 \n \n \n \nlimited circumstances required by federal law.  Pet. \nApp. 6a-7a. \nPatients insured through Medicaid choose PPSAT \nfor many reasons.  PPSAT provides non-judgmental, \nhigh-quality medical care.  See Pet. App. 6a-7a.  It also \nhas designed its services to help low-income patients \novercome barriers to accessing care.  Id. at 7a.  For \nexample, PPSAT offers extended hours and flexible \nscheduling; same-day appointments and short wait \ntimes; comprehensive contraceptive care in a single \nappointment; and interpreter services for patients \nwho do not speak English.  Ibid.  PPSAT continued to \noffer high-quality medical care during the COVID-19 \npandemic, including through telemedicine.  21-1043 \nResp. C.A. Br. 5.  That ensured continuity of care for \nlow-income patients and lessened the burdens on \nother parts of the health care system.  Pet. App. 7a-8a \n& n.2.   \nRespondent Julie Edwards is a Medicaid patient \nwho has received care at PPSAT.  Pet. App. 7a.  She \nsuffers from diabetes.  Id. at 44a.  Because doctors \nhave advised her that complications from diabetes \nwould make it dangerous for her to carry a pregnancy \nto term, she sought access to safe and effective birth \ncontrol.  Ibid.  After having difficulty finding a doctor \nwho would treat her, she obtained care at PPSAT.  Id. \nat 7a, 44a.  PPSAT doctors provided her with birth \ncontrol and also informed her that her blood pressure \nwas elevated, so she could obtain follow-up care for \nthat issue.  Ibid.  Ms. Edwards was impressed with \nPPSAT and intends to obtain future gynecological and \nreproductive health care there.  Ibid.   \n3. In July 2018, South Carolina\u2019s Department of \nHealth and Human Services (SCDHHS) terminated \nPPSAT\u2019s participation in the state Medicaid program.  \nPet. App. 8a, 70a.  The termination was prompted by \n\n5 \n \n \n \nthe Governor, who issued two executive orders \ndesigned to withdraw state funding from any \norganization that provides abortions, purportedly \nbased on a twenty-five-year-old statute.  Id. at 8a, 88a; \nsee S.C. Code Ann. \u00a7 43-5-1185. \nRelying on those orders, SCDHHS terminated \nPPSAT\u2019s state Medicaid agreement.  Pet. App. 8a.  \nSCDHHS did not find that PPSAT is unqualified to \nprovide care.  Id. at 87a.  Instead, it terminated \nPPSAT\u2019s participation in Medicaid \u201csolely because \n[PPSAT] performed abortions outside of the Medicaid \nprogram.\u201d  Ibid.  As a result of the termination, \nPPSAT\u2019s health centers immediately had to begin \nturning away Medicaid patients.  Id. at 88a. \n4. Respondents sued under 42 U.S.C. 1983.  Pet. \nApp. 8a.  They alleged, inter alia, that the termination \nviolates the Medicaid Act\u2019s free-choice-of-provider \nprovision.  Ibid.  They sought preliminary injunctive \nrelief, so that Ms. Edwards and other patients could \ncontinue to receive care from their chosen providers.  \nIbid. \nThe \ndistrict \ncourt \nentered \na \npreliminary \ninjunction.  Pet. App. 126a-146a.  As a threshold \nmatter, it held that the Medicaid Act\u2019s free-choice-of-\nprovider requirement is privately enforceable under \nSection 1983 because the statute \u201cunambiguously \nconfers a right\u201d on Medicaid patients to \u201cobtain \nassistance from any qualified and willing provider.\u201d  \nId. at 134a.  Then, on the merits, the court concluded \nthat petitioner likely violated the Medicaid Act by \nterminating PPSAT\u2019s Medicaid participation without \ncause.  Id. at 138a-141a.  The court found it \n\u201cundisputed\u201d that PPSAT is \u201cqualified\u201d to provide \nmedical care, as the statute requires.  Id. at 138a-139a \n(citing 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(23)(A)).   \n\n6 \n \n \n \nThe court of appeals affirmed the preliminary \ninjunction.  Pet. App. 80a-125a.  Like the district \ncourt, the court of appeals concluded that a Medicaid \npatient may sue under Section 1983 to enforce the \nfree-choice-of-provider requirement.  Id. at 94a-98a.  \nApplying this Court\u2019s decisions in Blessing v. \nFreestone, 520 U.S. 329 (1997), and Gonzaga \nUniversity v. Doe, 536 U.S. 273 (2002), the court of \nappeals recognized that a federal statute creates a \nright enforceable under Section 1983 \u201conly when the \nunderlying statute itself unambiguously \u2018confers an \nindividual right\u2019 on the plaintiff.\u201d  Pet. App. 94a \n(quoting Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at 284-285).   \nHere, the court of appeals explained, the statute is \n\u201cunmistakably \nclear\u201d \nin \ncreating \na \nprivately \nenforceable right.  Pet. App. 103a-104a.  \u201cIf th[is] \nlanguage does not suffice to confer a private right, \nenforceable under \u00a7 1983,\u201d the court stated, \u201cit is \ndifficult to see what language would be adequate.\u201d  Id. \nat 102a.  All three judges agreed on this point.  See \nibid.; id. at 120a-125a (Richardson, J., concurring) \n(agreeing that the statute \u201cunambiguously create[s] a \nright privately enforceable under \u00a7 1983\u201d).    \nOn the merits, the court of appeals concluded that \nPPSAT and Ms. Edwards established a likelihood of \nsuccess on the merits because under the free-choice-\nof-provider provision, a state may not exclude a \nqualified and willing provider.  Pet. App. 138a-141a.  \nThe court noted that petitioner did not dispute that \n\u201cPPSAT is professionally qualified to deliver the \nservices that [Ms. Edwards] seeks.\u201d  Id. at 107a; see \nid. at 98a n.3 (\u201cPPSAT\u2019s qualifications are simply not \nin dispute\u201d in this case.).  The court rejected \npetitioner\u2019s argument that it can terminate the \nMedicaid contract of any provider it wishes even when \n\n7 \n \n \n \nit \u201cadmits\u201d that the provider is \u201cperfectly competent.\u201d  \nId. at 109a-110a.   \nPetitioner filed a petition for a writ of certiorari, \nwhich this Court denied.  Baker v. Planned \nParenthood S. Atl., 141 S. Ct. 550 (2020) (No. 19-\n1186). \n5. The district court granted summary judgment \nto PPSAT and Ms. Edwards and entered a permanent \ninjunction.  Pet App. 68a-79a.  The court again held \nthat \nthe \nMedicaid \nAct\u2019s \nfree-choice-of-provider \nprovision is privately enforceable under Section 1983 \nand determined that petitioner violated the Medicaid \nAct by terminating PPSAT\u2019s participation in the state \nMedicaid program.  Id. at 74a.  The court noted that \npetitioner did not dispute that PPSAT is a \u201cmedically \nand professionally qualified provider\u201d and determined \nthat petitioner accordingly had no valid basis for the \ntermination.  Ibid. \nThe court of appeals affirmed.  Pet. App. 38a-64a.  \nThe court again held that Medicaid\u2019s free-choice-of-\nprovider provision confers a right enforceable under \nSection 1983.  Id. at 54a-64a.  The court carefully \nreviewed this Court\u2019s precedents and recognized that \n\u201cnothing \u2018short of an unambiguously conferred right\u2019  \n*  *  *  may support a cause of action.\u201d  Id. at 55a \n(quoting Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at 283).  The statute here, \nthe \ncourt \nexplained, \n\u201cunmistakably \nevinces \nCongress\u2019s \nintention \nto \nconfer \non \nMedicaid \nbeneficiaries a right to the free choice of their \nprovider\u201d because it confers an individual right in \nmandatory terms; courts are competent to determine \nif a provider is qualified; and the Medicaid Act does \nnot provide a comprehensive enforcement scheme that \nshows \nCongress\u2019s \nintent \nto \nforeclose \nprivate \nenforcement.  Id. at 57a-62a.  Again, all three judges \nagreed that the statute unambiguously confers a \n\n8 \n \n \n \nprivate right enforceable under Section 1983.  Id. at \n51a-64a; id. at 65a (Richardson, J., concurring in the \njudgment).  \nThe court of appeals noted that petitioner no \nlonger contested the merits.  Pet. App. 51a.  \nSpecifically, petitioner \u201cd[id] not\u201d renew his merits \narguments \nto \n\u201cchallenge \nthe \ndistrict \ncourt\u2019s \ndetermination (and [the court of appeals\u2019] own \nprevious conclusion) that South Carolina violated\u201d the \nfree-choice-of-provider provision \u201cby terminating \nPlanned Parenthood\u2019s Medicaid provider agreement.\u201d  \nId. at 51a n.1.  \n6. This Court then granted the petition for a writ \nof certiorari in Talevski.  That petition presented two \nquestions:  (1) whether a federal statute that Congress \nenacted using its Spending Clause power can give rise \nto a right enforceable under Section 1983, and \n(2) whether two provisions in the Federal Nursing \nHome \nReform \nAct \n(FNHRA), \n42 \nU.S.C. \n1396r(c)(1)(A)(ii) and 1396r(c)(2)(A), are privately \nenforceable under Section 1983.  See Pet. at *i-ii, \nHealth & Hosp. Corp. of Marion Cnty. v. Talevski, No. \n21-806, 2021 WL 5702312 (Nov. 23, 2021).  The Court \nanswered both questions in the affirmative.  Talevski, \n599 U.S. at 175-191.  In concluding that the provisions \nat issue are privately enforceable under Section 1983, \nthe Court applied its \u201cestablished method for \nascertaining unambiguous conferral\u201d of an individual \nright.  Id. at 183; see id. at 175-191.  \nIn the meantime, petitioner filed a petition for a \nwrit of certiorari in this case.  The Court granted the \npetition, vacated the judgment of the court of appeals, \nand remanded the case for further consideration in \nlight of Talevski.  Kerr v. Planned Parenthood S. Atl., \n143 S. Ct. 2633 (2023) (No. 21-1431). \n\n9 \n \n \n \n7. The court of appeals affirmed.  Pet. App. 1a-\n36a.  \u201c[W]ith the benefit of Talevski\u2019s guidance,\u201d the \ncourt again held that the free-choice-of-provider \nprovision \nconfers \na \nright \nenforceable \nunder \nSection 1983.  Id. at 12a-13a. \nThe court of appeals explained that the free-choice-\nof-provider provision is enforceable under Section \n1983 \nbecause \nit \n\u201cexplicitly \ngives \nMedicaid \nbeneficiaries the right to the provider of their choice\u201d \nand \u201cthere is no indication that Congress wanted to \nforeclose such individuals from seeking relief under \n\u00a7 1983.\u201d  Pet. App. 14a.  On the first point, the court \nreviewed this Court\u2019s precedents and recognized that \n\u201c\u200a\u2018Gonzaga sets forth [the] established method for \nascertaining unambiguous conferral\u2019 of individual \nrights.\u201d  Id. at 19a (quoting Talevski, 599 U.S. at 183).  \nThat test is satisfied, the court continued, \u201cwhere the \nprovision in question is \u2018phrased in terms of the \npersons benefited\u2019 and contains \u2018rights-creating,\u2019 \nindividual-centric language with an \u2018unmistakable \nfocus on the benefited class.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Ibid. (quoting Talevski, \n599 U.S. at 183 (in turn quoting Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at \n284, 287)).   \nHere, the court of appeals explained, the free-\nchoice-of-provider provision unambiguously confers \nrights on individual Medicaid recipients:  \u201cLike the \ntext at issue in Talevski,\u201d the free-choice-of-provider \nprovision \u201cspeak[s] \u2018in terms of the person benefited,\u2019 \nand ha[s] an \u2018unmistakable focus on the benefited \nclass.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Pet. App. 25a (quoting Talevski, 599 U.S. at \n186).  The free-choice-of-provider provision, the court \nexplained, \u201cfocus[es] on discrete beneficiaries and \nguarantee[s] them a choice\u201d of any qualified medical \nprovider \u201cfree from state interference.\u201d  Ibid.  The \ncourt noted that Talevski \u201cbolstered [its] previous \nconclusion\u201d by providing examples of rights-creating \n\n10 \n \n \n \nlanguage \u201csimilar to the language\u201d in the free-choice-\nof-provider provision.  Ibid.   \nPetitioner had argued that the court of appeals \nshould reverse its prior holdings because its decisions \ncited Blessing and Wilder v. Virginia Hospital Ass\u2019n, \n496 U.S. 498 (1990), and in petitioner\u2019s view, those \ndecisions no longer are good law after Talevski.  Pet. \nApp. 14a.

South Carolina terminated the \nMedicaid \nprovider \nagreement \nof \na \nPlanned \nParenthood affiliate without cause.  The affiliate and \none of its patients sued under 42 U.S.C. 1983.  The \npatient invoked the Medicaid Act\u2019s free-choice-of-\nprovider provision, which states that \u201cany individual \neligible for medical assistance\u201d \u201cmay obtain such \nassistance from any institution\u201d that is \u201cqualified to \nperform the service or services required\u201d and \n\u201cundertakes to provide [the individual] such services.\u201d  \n42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(23)(A).   \nThree times, the court of appeals has held that the \nfree-choice-of-provider \nprovision \nunambiguously \nconfers a right that is privately enforceable under \nSection 1983.  In its most recent decision, the court of \nappeals so held after faithfully applying this Court\u2019s \nrecent decision in Health & Hospital Corp. of Marion \nCounty v. Talevski, 599 U.S. 166 (2023).  \nThe question presented is:  \nWhether the Medicaid Act\u2019s free-choice-of-provider \nprovision, 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(23)(A), confers a right \nenforceable under 42 U.S.C. 1983.   \n \n \n\nii \n \n \n \nRULE 29.6 STATEMENT \nPlanned Parenthood South Atlantic is a North \nCarolina non-profit corporation.

KERR, DIRECTOR, SOUTH CAROLINA  \nDEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, \nPETITIONER\nv. \nPLANNED PARENTHOOD SOUTH ATLANTIC, ET AL. \nOn Petition for a Writ of Certiorari to the  \nUnited States Court of Appeals  \nfor the Fourth Circuit \nBRIEF IN OPPOSITION\nOPINIONS BELOW \nThe opinion of the court of appeals (Pet. App. 1a-\n36a) is reported at 95 F.4th 152.  The opinion of the \ndistrict court (Pet. App. 68a-79a) is reported at 487 F. \nSupp. 3d 443.   \nPrior relevant opinions of the court of appeals (Pet. \nApp. 38a-65a, 80a-125a) are reported at 27 F.4th 945 \nand 941 F.3d 687.  A prior relevant order of the district \ncourt (Pet. App. 126a-146a) is reported at 326 F. Supp. \n3d 39.  \nJURISDICTION \nThe judgment of the court of appeals was entered \non March 5, 2024.  The petition for a writ of certiorari \nwas filed on June 3, 2024.  The jurisdiction of this \nCourt is invoked under 28 U.S.C. 1254(1).  \n\n2 \n \n \n \nSTATEMENT \nPlanned Parenthood South Atlantic (PPSAT) \nprovides essential medical services, including birth \ncontrol, cancer screenings, and physical exams, to low-\nincome South Carolina residents through the state\u2019s \nMedicaid program.  South Carolina terminated \nPPSAT\u2019s participation in that program, even though \nit \u201cagree[s]\u201d that PPSAT \u201cis perfectly competent to \nprovide  *  *  *  healthcare.\u201d  Pet. App. 41a.  PPSAT \nand one of its patients, who relies on PPSAT for care \nthat is critical for preserving her health, sued under \n42 U.S.C. 1983.  They contended that the termination \nviolates the Medicaid Act\u2019s free-choice-of-provider \nprovision, 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(23)(A), which gives \nMedicaid recipients the right to choose to receive their \nmedical care from any qualified and willing provider.  \nPet. App. 6a, 8a.   \nThe district court preliminarily enjoined the \ndirector of the state health department (petitioner) \nfrom terminating PPSAT\u2019s participation in the \nMedicaid program, Pet. App. 126a-146a; the court of \nappeals affirmed, id. at 80a-119a; and this Court \ndenied certiorari, see id. at 47a. \nThe \ndistrict \ncourt \nthen \ngranted \nsummary \njudgment to PPSAT and the patient, id. at 66a-79a; \nthe court of appeals affirmed, id. at 64a; and this \nCourt granted the petition, vacated, and remanded in \nlight of Health & Hospital Corp. of Marion County v. \nTalevski, 599 U.S. 166 (2023), Pet. App. 37a.  After \nreconsidering its prior holding in light of Talevski, the \ncourt of appeals again affirmed, with all three judges \nagreeing that the Medicaid Act\u2019s free-choice-of-\nprovider provision is privately enforceable under \nSection 1983.  Id. at 1a-35a; id. at 36a (Richardson, J., \nconcurring in the judgment).   \n\n3 \n \n \n \n1. Medicaid is the national health insurance \nprogram for persons of limited financial means.  Pet. \nApp. 5a.  It provides federal funding for medical care \nfor children, needy families, the elderly, the blind, the \ndisabled, and pregnant women.  See 42 U.S.C. \n1396d(a).   \nMedicaid is a joint federal-state effort.  Pet. App. \n5a.  A state must comply with various federal \nrequirements to participate, see Armstrong v. \nExceptional Child Ctr., Inc., 575 U.S. 320, 323 (2015), \nincluding the free-choice-of-provider requirement.  To \ncomply with that requirement, a state\u2019s Medicaid plan \n\u201cmust\u201d provide that \u201cany individual eligible for \nmedical assistance  *  *  *  may obtain such assistance\u201d \nfrom any provider who is \u201cqualified to perform the \nservice or services required\u201d and \u201cwho undertakes to \nprovide \nhim \nsuch \nservices.\u201d \n \n42 \nU.S.C. \n1396a(a)(23)(A).   \n2. PPSAT and its predecessors have provided \nhealth care to low-income residents of South Carolina \nfor four decades.  Pet. App. 7a, 58a.  PPSAT operates \ntwo health centers in the state, one in Charleston and \none in Columbia.  Id. at 6a.  Both are in medically \nunderserved communities.  See Resp. C.A. Br. 4, No. \n21-1043 (4th Cir. May 28, 2021) (21-1043 Resp. C.A. \nBr.).  Those centers serve hundreds of Medicaid \npatients each year.  Pet. App. 7a, 87a. \nPPSAT\u2019s health centers provide essential medical \ncare through Medicaid.  They offer a range of services, \nincluding \nphysical \nexams; \ncancer \nscreenings; \ncontraception; pregnancy testing and counseling; and \nscreening for conditions such as diabetes, depression, \nanemia, cholesterol, thyroid disorders, and high blood \npressure.  Pet. App. 6a, 69a; 21-1043 Resp. C.A. Br. 4.  \nThe health centers provide abortion services, but \nMedicaid does not pay for abortion except in the very \n\n4 \n \n \n \nlimited circumstances required by federal law.  Pet. \nApp. 6a-7a. \nPatients insured through Medicaid choose PPSAT \nfor many reasons.  PPSAT provides non-judgmental, \nhigh-quality medical care.  See Pet. App. 6a-7a.  It also \nhas designed its services to help low-income patients \novercome barriers to accessing care.  Id. at 7a.  For \nexample, PPSAT offers extended hours and flexible \nscheduling; same-day appointments and short wait \ntimes; comprehensive contraceptive care in a single \nappointment; and interpreter services for patients \nwho do not speak English.  Ibid.  PPSAT continued to \noffer high-quality medical care during the COVID-19 \npandemic, including through telemedicine.  21-1043 \nResp. C.A. Br. 5.  That ensured continuity of care for \nlow-income patients and lessened the burdens on \nother parts of the health care system.  Pet. App. 7a-8a \n& n.2.   \nRespondent Julie Edwards is a Medicaid patient \nwho has received care at PPSAT.  Pet. App. 7a.  She \nsuffers from diabetes.  Id. at 44a.  Because doctors \nhave advised her that complications from diabetes \nwould make it dangerous for her to carry a pregnancy \nto term, she sought access to safe and effective birth \ncontrol.  Ibid.  After having difficulty finding a doctor \nwho would treat her, she obtained care at PPSAT.  Id. \nat 7a, 44a.  PPSAT doctors provided her with birth \ncontrol and also informed her that her blood pressure \nwas elevated, so she could obtain follow-up care for \nthat issue.  Ibid.  Ms. Edwards was impressed with \nPPSAT and intends to obtain future gynecological and \nreproductive health care there.  Ibid.   \n3. In July 2018, South Carolina\u2019s Department of \nHealth and Human Services (SCDHHS) terminated \nPPSAT\u2019s participation in the state Medicaid program.  \nPet. App. 8a, 70a.  The termination was prompted by \n\n5 \n \n \n \nthe Governor, who issued two executive orders \ndesigned to withdraw state funding from any \norganization that provides abortions, purportedly \nbased on a twenty-five-year-old statute.  Id. at 8a, 88a; \nsee S.C. Code Ann. \u00a7 43-5-1185. \nRelying on those orders, SCDHHS terminated \nPPSAT\u2019s state Medicaid agreement.  Pet. App. 8a.  \nSCDHHS did not find that PPSAT is unqualified to \nprovide care.  Id. at 87a.  Instead, it terminated \nPPSAT\u2019s participation in Medicaid \u201csolely because \n[PPSAT] performed abortions outside of the Medicaid \nprogram.\u201d  Ibid.  As a result of the termination, \nPPSAT\u2019s health centers immediately had to begin \nturning away Medicaid patients.  Id. at 88a. \n4. Respondents sued under 42 U.S.C. 1983.  Pet. \nApp. 8a.  They alleged, inter alia, that the termination \nviolates the Medicaid Act\u2019s free-choice-of-provider \nprovision.  Ibid.  They sought preliminary injunctive \nrelief, so that Ms. Edwards and other patients could \ncontinue to receive care from their chosen providers.  \nIbid. \nThe \ndistrict \ncourt \nentered \na \npreliminary \ninjunction.  Pet. App. 126a-146a.  As a threshold \nmatter, it held that the Medicaid Act\u2019s free-choice-of-\nprovider requirement is privately enforceable under \nSection 1983 because the statute \u201cunambiguously \nconfers a right\u201d on Medicaid patients to \u201cobtain \nassistance from any qualified and willing provider.\u201d  \nId. at 134a.  Then, on the merits, the court concluded \nthat petitioner likely violated the Medicaid Act by \nterminating PPSAT\u2019s Medicaid participation without \ncause.  Id. at 138a-141a.  The court found it \n\u201cundisputed\u201d that PPSAT is \u201cqualified\u201d to provide \nmedical care, as the statute requires.  Id. at 138a-139a \n(citing 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(23)(A)).   \n\n6 \n \n \n \nThe court of appeals affirmed the preliminary \ninjunction.  Pet. App. 80a-125a.  Like the district \ncourt, the court of appeals concluded that a Medicaid \npatient may sue under Section 1983 to enforce the \nfree-choice-of-provider requirement.  Id. at 94a-98a.  \nApplying this Court\u2019s decisions in Blessing v. \nFreestone, 520 U.S. 329 (1997), and Gonzaga \nUniversity v. Doe, 536 U.S. 273 (2002), the court of \nappeals recognized that a federal statute creates a \nright enforceable under Section 1983 \u201conly when the \nunderlying statute itself unambiguously \u2018confers an \nindividual right\u2019 on the plaintiff.\u201d  Pet. App. 94a \n(quoting Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at 284-285).   \nHere, the court of appeals explained, the statute is \n\u201cunmistakably \nclear\u201d \nin \ncreating \na \nprivately \nenforceable right.  Pet. App. 103a-104a.  \u201cIf th[is] \nlanguage does not suffice to confer a private right, \nenforceable under \u00a7 1983,\u201d the court stated, \u201cit is \ndifficult to see what language would be adequate.\u201d  Id. \nat 102a.  All three judges agreed on this point.  See \nibid.; id. at 120a-125a (Richardson, J., concurring) \n(agreeing that the statute \u201cunambiguously create[s] a \nright privately enforceable under \u00a7 1983\u201d).    \nOn the merits, the court of appeals concluded that \nPPSAT and Ms. Edwards established a likelihood of \nsuccess on the merits because under the free-choice-\nof-provider provision, a state may not exclude a \nqualified and willing provider.  Pet. App. 138a-141a.  \nThe court noted that petitioner did not dispute that \n\u201cPPSAT is professionally qualified to deliver the \nservices that [Ms. Edwards] seeks.\u201d  Id. at 107a; see \nid. at 98a n.3 (\u201cPPSAT\u2019s qualifications are simply not \nin dispute\u201d in this case.).  The court rejected \npetitioner\u2019s argument that it can terminate the \nMedicaid contract of any provider it wishes even when \n\n7 \n \n \n \nit \u201cadmits\u201d that the provider is \u201cperfectly competent.\u201d  \nId. at 109a-110a.   \nPetitioner filed a petition for a writ of certiorari, \nwhich this Court denied.  Baker v. Planned \nParenthood S. Atl., 141 S. Ct. 550 (2020) (No. 19-\n1186). \n5. The district court granted summary judgment \nto PPSAT and Ms. Edwards and entered a permanent \ninjunction.  Pet App. 68a-79a.  The court again held \nthat \nthe \nMedicaid \nAct\u2019s \nfree-choice-of-provider \nprovision is privately enforceable under Section 1983 \nand determined that petitioner violated the Medicaid \nAct by terminating PPSAT\u2019s participation in the state \nMedicaid program.  Id. at 74a.  The court noted that \npetitioner did not dispute that PPSAT is a \u201cmedically \nand professionally qualified provider\u201d and determined \nthat petitioner accordingly had no valid basis for the \ntermination.  Ibid. \nThe court of appeals affirmed.  Pet. App. 38a-64a.  \nThe court again held that Medicaid\u2019s free-choice-of-\nprovider provision confers a right enforceable under \nSection 1983.  Id. at 54a-64a.  The court carefully \nreviewed this Court\u2019s precedents and recognized that \n\u201cnothing \u2018short of an unambiguously conferred right\u2019  \n*  *  *  may support a cause of action.\u201d  Id. at 55a \n(quoting Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at 283).  The statute here, \nthe \ncourt \nexplained, \n\u201cunmistakably \nevinces \nCongress\u2019s \nintention \nto \nconfer \non \nMedicaid \nbeneficiaries a right to the free choice of their \nprovider\u201d because it confers an individual right in \nmandatory terms; courts are competent to determine \nif a provider is qualified; and the Medicaid Act does \nnot provide a comprehensive enforcement scheme that \nshows \nCongress\u2019s \nintent \nto \nforeclose \nprivate \nenforcement.  Id. at 57a-62a.  Again, all three judges \nagreed that the statute unambiguously confers a \n\n8 \n \n \n \nprivate right enforceable under Section 1983.  Id. at \n51a-64a; id. at 65a (Richardson, J., concurring in the \njudgment).  \nThe court of appeals noted that petitioner no \nlonger contested the merits.  Pet. App. 51a.  \nSpecifically, petitioner \u201cd[id] not\u201d renew his merits \narguments \nto \n\u201cchallenge \nthe \ndistrict \ncourt\u2019s \ndetermination (and [the court of appeals\u2019] own \nprevious conclusion) that South Carolina violated\u201d the \nfree-choice-of-provider provision \u201cby terminating \nPlanned Parenthood\u2019s Medicaid provider agreement.\u201d  \nId. at 51a n.1.  \n6. This Court then granted the petition for a writ \nof certiorari in Talevski.  That petition presented two \nquestions:  (1) whether a federal statute that Congress \nenacted using its Spending Clause power can give rise \nto a right enforceable under Section 1983, and \n(2) whether two provisions in the Federal Nursing \nHome \nReform \nAct \n(FNHRA), \n42 \nU.S.C. \n1396r(c)(1)(A)(ii) and 1396r(c)(2)(A), are privately \nenforceable under Section 1983.  See Pet. at *i-ii, \nHealth & Hosp. Corp. of Marion Cnty. v. Talevski, No. \n21-806, 2021 WL 5702312 (Nov. 23, 2021).  The Court \nanswered both questions in the affirmative.  Talevski, \n599 U.S. at 175-191.  In concluding that the provisions \nat issue are privately enforceable under Section 1983, \nthe Court applied its \u201cestablished method for \nascertaining unambiguous conferral\u201d of an individual \nright.  Id. at 183; see id. at 175-191.  \nIn the meantime, petitioner filed a petition for a \nwrit of certiorari in this case.  The Court granted the \npetition, vacated the judgment of the court of appeals, \nand remanded the case for further consideration in \nlight of Talevski.  Kerr v. Planned Parenthood S. Atl., \n143 S. Ct. 2633 (2023) (No. 21-1431). \n\n9 \n \n \n \n7. The court of appeals affirmed.  Pet. App. 1a-\n36a.  \u201c[W]ith the benefit of Talevski\u2019s guidance,\u201d the \ncourt again held that the free-choice-of-provider \nprovision \nconfers \na \nright \nenforceable \nunder \nSection 1983.  Id. at 12a-13a. \nThe court of appeals explained that the free-choice-\nof-provider provision is enforceable under Section \n1983 \nbecause \nit \n\u201cexplicitly \ngives \nMedicaid \nbeneficiaries the right to the provider of their choice\u201d \nand \u201cthere is no indication that Congress wanted to \nforeclose such individuals from seeking relief under \n\u00a7 1983.\u201d  Pet. App. 14a.  On the first point, the court \nreviewed this Court\u2019s precedents and recognized that \n\u201c\u200a\u2018Gonzaga sets forth [the] established method for \nascertaining unambiguous conferral\u2019 of individual \nrights.\u201d  Id. at 19a (quoting Talevski, 599 U.S. at 183).  \nThat test is satisfied, the court continued, \u201cwhere the \nprovision in question is \u2018phrased in terms of the \npersons benefited\u2019 and contains \u2018rights-creating,\u2019 \nindividual-centric language with an \u2018unmistakable \nfocus on the benefited class.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Ibid. (quoting Talevski, \n599 U.S. at 183 (in turn quoting Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at \n284, 287)).   \nHere, the court of appeals explained, the free-\nchoice-of-provider provision unambiguously confers \nrights on individual Medicaid recipients:  \u201cLike the \ntext at issue in Talevski,\u201d the free-choice-of-provider \nprovision \u201cspeak[s] \u2018in terms of the person benefited,\u2019 \nand ha[s] an \u2018unmistakable focus on the benefited \nclass.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Pet. App. 25a (quoting Talevski, 599 U.S. at \n186).  The free-choice-of-provider provision, the court \nexplained, \u201cfocus[es] on discrete beneficiaries and \nguarantee[s] them a choice\u201d of any qualified medical \nprovider \u201cfree from state interference.\u201d  Ibid.  The \ncourt noted that Talevski \u201cbolstered [its] previous \nconclusion\u201d by providing examples of rights-creating \n\n10 \n \n \n \nlanguage \u201csimilar to the language\u201d in the free-choice-\nof-provider provision.  Ibid.   \nPetitioner had argued that the court of appeals \nshould reverse its prior holdings because its decisions \ncited Blessing and Wilder v. Virginia Hospital Ass\u2019n, \n496 U.S. 498 (1990), and in petitioner\u2019s view, those \ndecisions no longer are good law after Talevski.  Pet. \nApp. 14a.  The court of appeals noted that Talevski did \nnot overrule either decision.  Id. at 22a-23a, 28a.  But \neither way, the court explained, \u201cthe central analysis \nremains the same\u201d \u2013 Talevski made clear that courts \nshould \u201clook primarily to Gonzaga\u201d to determine \nwhether Congress unambiguously conferred an \nindividual right, and the court of appeals\u2019 prior \ndecisions \u201cturned upon\u201d that same analysis and \n\u201crelied heavily on Gonzaga.\u201d  Id. at 23a.   \nThe court of appeals then reiterated its conclusion \nthat \nthe \nMedicaid \nAct \ndoes \nnot \nprovide \na \ncomprehensive enforcement scheme that shows \nCongress\u2019s intent to foreclose private enforcement.  \nPet. App. 32a-33a.  The court noted that petitioner \nhad \u201cnot asked us to revisit this question [i]n this \nappeal.\u201d  Id. at 33a. \nFinally, the court of appeals noted that it is \nundisputed that PPSAT is a qualified and willing \nprovider and that petitioner\u2019s decision to terminate \nPPSAT from South Carolina\u2019s Medicaid program was \nunjustified.  Pet. App. 33a-34a.  The court emphasized \nthat petitioner \u201chas not contested\u201d \u2013 at any time \n\u201cduring the long path of this litigation\u201d \u2013 that PPSAT \n\u201cis professionally qualified to provide the care that the \nplaintiff seeks.\u201d  Id. at 33a.  \nJudge Richardson concurred in the judgment.  Pet. \nApp. 35a-36a (Richardson, J., concurring in the \njudgment).  He agreed that the statute here \u201ccreate[s] \n\n11 \n \n \n \nan individual right enforceable under 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1983,\u201d but suggested this Court provide additional \nguidance on the relevant legal standard.  Id. at 36a \n(Richardson, J., concurring in the judgment).     \nARGUMENT \nPetitioner asks this Court (Pet. 15-16) to grant \ncertiorari to address two questions:  (1) whether the \nMedicaid Act\u2019s free-choice-of-provider provision, 42 \nU.S.C. 1396a(a)(23)(A), is privately enforceable under \n42 U.S.C. 1983, and (2) if so, whether the free-choice-\nof-provider provision allows a state to terminate a \nMedicaid provider for any reason, even if the state \nacknowledges that the provider is professionally \nqualified.  This Court\u2019s review is not warranted on \neither question.   \nOn the first question, the court of appeals \nfaithfully applied this Court\u2019s precedents, including \nTalevski, and its conclusion is consistent with that of \nnearly every court that has considered the issue.  \nPetitioner contends (Pet. 31-32) that the courts of \nappeals need guidance on the appropriate test for \ndetermining whether a federal statute is privately \nenforceable under Section 1983.  But Talevski already \nprovided that guidance; the Court reaffirmed that \ncourts should use its \u201cestablished method\u201d (599 U.S. \nat 183) for deciding whether a provision is privately \nenforceable.  This Court has repeatedly denied \npetitions presenting this first question \u2013 including in \nthis case1 \u2013 and it should do the same here.   \n \n1 Baker v. Planned Parenthood S. Atl., 141 S. Ct. 550 (2020) (No. \n19-1186); Gee v. Planned Parenthood of Gulf Coast, Inc., 139 \nS. Ct. 408 (2018) (No. 17-1492); Andersen v. Planned Parenthood \nof Kan. & Mid-Mo., 139 S. Ct. 638 (2018) (No. 17-1340); Betlach \nv. Planned Parenthood Ariz., Inc., 571 U.S. 1198 (2014) (No. 13-\n \n\n12 \n \n \n \nThis case does not present the second question, \nbecause that question concerns whether a patient has \na right to choose an unqualified provider, and \npetitioner has conceded throughout this litigation \nthat PPSAT is a qualified provider.  Further, \npetitioner presented no argument on this issue to the \ndistrict court on summary judgment or to the court of \nappeals in two rounds of briefing on appeal from that \ndecision.  He accordingly has forfeited any argument \nbased on that question.  Even if the question were \npresented here, petitioner\u2019s argument is mistaken, \nand no circuit split exists.  Further review therefore is \nunwarranted.      \nI. \nTHE PRIVATE-RIGHT-OF-ACTION ISSUE \nDOES NOT WARRANT THIS COURT\u2019S \nREVIEW \nPetitioner contends (Pet. 17-32) that the Medicaid \nAct\u2019s \nfree-choice-of-provider \nprovision, \n42 \nU.S.C. 1396a(a)(23)(A), is not privately enforceable \nunder 42 U.S.C. 1983.  He is wrong, and the issue does \nnot warrant the Court\u2019s review.  \nA. The court of appeals\u2019 decision is correct. \n1. Section 1983 authorizes \u201cany citizen of the \nUnited States or other person within [its] jurisdiction\u201d \nto sue any person who, \u201cunder color of\u201d state law, \n\u201cdepriv[ed]\u201d him or her \u201cof any rights, privileges, or \nimmunities secured by\u201d federal law.  42 U.S.C. 1983.  \nA person deprived of a right created by a federal \nstatute by a state actor may sue under Section 1983.  \nSee Maine v. Thiboutot, 448 U.S. 1, 4 (1980). \n \n621); Secretary of Ind. Fam. & Soc. Servs. Admin. v. Planned \nParenthood of Ind., Inc., 569 U.S. 1004 (2013) (No. 12-1039). \n\n13 \n \n \n \nThe federal statute at issue here gives a Medicaid \npatient the right to obtain care from the qualified and \nwilling provider of his or her choice.  It states:  \nA State plan for medical assistance must  *  *  *  \nprovide that  *  *  *  any individual eligible for \nmedical assistance  *  *  *  may obtain such \nassistance from any institution  *  *  *  qualified \nto perform the service or services required  \n*  *  *  [that] undertakes to provide him such \nservices.  \n42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(23)(A).   \nCongress enacted this provision to ensure that \nMedicaid recipients, like other individuals, could \nmake deeply personal choices about where to obtain \nmedical care without states \u201crestricting beneficiaries \nto certain providers.\u201d  Pet. App. 6a; see, e.g., S. Rep. \nNo. 744, 90th Cong., 1st Sess. 183 (1967).  Congress \nthen reiterated the importance of this right in the \nfamily-planning context, providing that even when a \nstate uses a managed-care system, the state cannot \nlimit a patient\u2019s free choice of provider for family-\nplanning services.  See 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(23)(B) \n(cross-reference to 42 U.S.C. 1396d(a)(4)(C)). \n2. In a careful and thorough opinion, the court of \nappeals faithfully applied this Court\u2019s precedents and \ncorrectly concluded that the Medicaid Act\u2019s free-\nchoice-of-provider provision is privately enforceable \nunder Section 1983.  Pet. App. 5a-35a.  All three \njudges agreed that the statute at issue here is \u201cclear \nand \nunambiguous\u201d \nin \nconferring \na \nprivately \nenforceable right.  Id. at 29a; see id. at 36a \n(Richardson, J., concurring in the judgment).  This \nwas not a close call:  The court found it \u201chard to \nconceive of any text  *  *  *  that would permit\u201d a \nprivate right of action \u201c[i]f the language of this \n\n14 \n \n \n \nmedical provider provision does not suffice.\u201d  Id. at \n35a.   \nThe court of appeals began its analysis by carefully \nreviewing this Court\u2019s precedents, including the \nrecent decision in Talevski.  Pet. App. 15a-21a.  \nTalevski applied the Court\u2019s settled precedents to hold \nthat a nursing facility resident could sue under \nSection 1983 to enforce two particular provisions of \nFNHRA.  599 U.S. at 180-191.  In so holding, Talevski \nexplained that \u201c\u200a\u2018Gonzaga sets forth [the] established \nmethod for ascertaining unambiguous conferral\u2019 of \nindividual rights,\u201d and that this test is satisfied \n\u201cwhere the provision in question is \u2018phrased in terms \nof the persons benefited\u2019 and contains \u2018rights-\ncreating,\u2019 \nindividual-centric \nlanguage \nwith \nan \n\u2018unmistakable focus on the benefited class.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Pet. App. \n19a (quoting Talevski, 599 U.S. at 183 (in turn quoting \nGonzaga, 536 U.S. at 284, 287)).  As the court of \nappeals recognized, this Court\u2019s decisions set a \n\u201cdemanding bar\u201d for finding a privately enforceable \nright.  Id. at 22a (quoting Talevski, 599 U.S. at 180). \nApplying that guidance, the court of appeals \ncorrectly concluded that the free-choice-of-provider \nprovision is privately enforceable.  The court \n\u201crigorously examine[d]\u201d the statutory text and \nconcluded that it unambiguously gives Medicaid \npatients an individual right to obtain care from their \nprovider of choice.  Pet. App. 22a, 25a.  The statute \nspecifically defines the intended class of beneficiaries \n(\u201cany individual  *  *  *  eligible for medical assistance\u201d \nunder Medicaid) and gives them a particular right \n(the right to \u201cobtain [care] from any\u201d qualified \nprovider). \n \nId. \nat \n23a \n(quoting \n42 \nU.S.C. \n1396a(a)(23)(A); emphasis omitted).   \nThat language is \u201ca prime example of the kind of \n\u2018rights-creating\u2019 language required to confer a \n\n15 \n \n \n \npersonal right on a discrete class of persons.\u201d  Pet. \nApp. 25a-26a (discussing Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at 284 \nn.3).  It \u201cspeak[s] in terms of the persons benefited and \nha[s] an unmistakable focus on the benefited class.\u201d  \nId. at 25a (quoting Talevski, 599 U.S. at 186).  Indeed, \nthe court explained, Talevski \u201cbolstered\u201d the court\u2019s \nprior conclusion on this point \u201cby providing additional \nexamples of rights-creating language similar to the \nlanguage at issue here.\u201d  Ibid.  \nFurther, the court of appeals found no indication \nin the statutory text that Congress intended to \nforeclose a Section 1983 remedy.  Pet. App. 32a-33a.  \nThere is no \u201cincompatibility between enforcement \nunder \u00a7 1983 and the enforcement scheme that \nCongress has enacted.\u201d  Id. at 32a (quoting Talevski, \n599 U.S. at 187).  That is particularly true, the court \nexplained, because \u201cthere is no way for Medicaid \nbeneficiaries to challenge disqualifications of their \npreferred providers through the administrative \nscheme.\u201d  Ibid.2  Notably, petitioner did not contest \nthis point in the court of appeals.  The court previously \nhad held that \u201cthe Medicaid Act provides no \ncomprehensive enforcement scheme sufficient to \novercome the presumption that the free-choice-of-\nprovider provision is enforceable under \u00a7 1983,\u201d id. at \n32a (quoting id. at 102a), and \u201cSouth Carolina d[id] \n \n2 Petitioner asserts in passing (Pet. 9) that PPSAT was required \nto exhaust state administrative remedies.  But patients such as \nMs. Edwards \u2013 the people with the free-choice-of-provider right \n\u2013 cannot participate in this administrative review process.  And \neven if Ms. Edwards could use that process, both the district \ncourt and court of appeals found that doing so would be \u201cfutile.\u201d  \nPet. App. 101a n.4.  Besides, it is well-established that a person \nis not required to exhaust administrative remedies before filing \nsuit under Section 1983.  Patsy v. Board of Regents of State of \nFla., 457 U.S. 496, 516 (1982); see Pet. App. 101a n.4.   \n\n16 \n \n \n \nnot ask\u201d the court \u201cto revisit this question [i]n this \nappeal,\u201d id. at 33a.  \n3. Petitioner offers two main criticisms of the \ncourt of appeals\u2019 decision.  Pet. 30-32, 36-37.  Neither \nhas merit.  \nFirst, petitioner argues (Pet. 36-37) that the court \nof appeals erred in reading the free-choice-of-provider \nprovision to create an unambiguously conferred right.  \nHe contends (ibid.) that the free-choice-of-provider \nprovision lacks rights-creating language, comparing it \nto the provision in Gonzaga that \u201csp[oke] only in terms \nof institutional policy and practice, not individual[s].\u201d  \n536 U.S. at 288 (discussing 20 U.S.C. 1232g(b)(1)-(2)).  \nThat comparison is inapt.  Whereas the provision in \nGonzaga concerned only institutional \u201cpolic[ies] or \npractice[s],\u201d 20 U.S.C. 1232g(b)(1)-(2), the free-choice-\nof-provider provision addresses whether \u201cindividual\u201d \nMedicaid patients \u201cmay obtain\u201d \u201cmedical assistance\u201d \nfrom \ntheir \nchosen \nproviders, \n42 \nU.S.C. \n1396a(a)(23)(A). \nPetitioner also notes (Pet. 36-37) that the free-\nchoice-of-provider provision does not contain the word \n\u201cright.\u201d  Yet there is no basis for petitioner\u2019s \u201cmagic \nwords\u201d rule.  Pet. App. 26a (quoting Federal Aviation \nAdmin. v. Copper, 566 U.S. 284, 291 (2012)).  The free-\nchoice-of-provider provision has an \u201cunmistakable \nfocus\u201d on the benefited class and is \u201cphrased in terms \nof the persons benefited,\u201d which \u201csatisfie[s]\u201d this \nCourt\u2019s test for whether a statute contains the \nnecessary rights-creating language.  Talevski, 599 \nU.S. at 183. \nSecond, petitioner argues (Pet. 30-31, 35-36) that \nthe court of appeals erred by putting too much weight \non this Court\u2019s decisions in Blessing and Wilder.  That \nis mistaken.  The court of appeals recognized that \n\n17 \n \n \n \n\u201c\u200a\u2018Gonzaga sets forth [the] established method for \nascertaining unambiguous conferral\u2019 of individual \nrights.\u201d  Id. at 19a (quoting Talevski, 599 U.S. at 183).  \nThe court then correctly stated and applied that test, \nexplaining that, for a statutory provision to be \nprivately enforceable, it must unambiguously confer \nan individual right on a particular class of people, and \nit must not include a comprehensive enforcement \nscheme showing a congressional intent to preclude \nprivate enforcement.  Pet. App. 24a-31a, 32a.  \nFurther, the court correctly noted that this Court has \nnot overruled Blessing.  Id. at 22a-23a.  Indeed, as the \ncourt noted (id. at 31a), both Gonzaga and Talevski \ncited Blessing.  See Talevski, 599 U.S. at 189; \nGonzaga, 536 U.S. at 287-289.   \nFar from changing the standard for determining \nwhether a federal law secures rights for Section 1983 \npurposes, the Court in Talevski stated that it was \napplying its \u201cestablished method for ascertaining \nunambiguous conferral\u201d to the federal statute at issue \nin that case.  599 U.S. at 183; see id. at 184-186.  The \ncourt of appeals likewise recognized that, throughout \nthis Court\u2019s line of decisions, the \u201ccentral inquiry\u201d has \nremained the same \u2013 \u201cwhether Congress conferred a \nclear and unambiguous right upon a discrete class of \nbeneficiaries.\u201d  Pet. App. 21a.  The court of appeals \nexplained that this analysis \u201cremains the same\u201d \u201cwith \nor without Blessing,\u201d id. at 23a, and it did not even \ncite Blessing in evaluating whether the free-choice-of-\nprovider provision is enforceable under Section 1983, \nsee id. at 24a-33a.  Instead, as in its prior decisions, it \nfocused on Gonzaga.  Id. at 23a-26a.  Petitioner is \n\n18 \n \n \n \ntherefore wrong to criticize the court of appeals for its \nbrief citations to Blessing.3  \nPetitioner likewise is wrong to say (Pet. 31, 35) \nthat the court of appeals improperly relied on Wilder.  \nThe court cited Wilder only for a narrow proposition \u2013 \nthat a provision in the Medicaid Act can create a \nprivately enforceable right.  Pet. App. 27a, 32a.  That \nis just a statement of the holding in Wilder.  Id. at 27a \n(citing Wilder, 496 U.S. at 509-510 (holding that the \nBoren Amendment is privately enforceable under \nSection 1983)).  That holding has never been called \ninto question by this Court.  In fact, the Court \n\u201capprovingly cited Wilder on this point\u201d in City of \nRancho Palos Verdes v. Abrams, 544 U.S. 113, 122 \n(2005).  Pet. App. 62a.   \nThis Court has questioned other parts of Wilder, \nbut the court of appeals recognized that, stating that \nthis Court has \u201cnoted  * * *  that \u2018[its] later opinions \nplainly repudiate the ready implication of a \u00a7 1983 \naction that Wilder exemplified\u2019\u201d and \u201cexpressly \n\u2018reject[ed] the notion,\u2019 implicit in Wilder, \u2018that [its] \ncases permit anything short of an unambiguously \nconferred right.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Pet. App. 27a-28a (quoting \nArmstrong, 575 U.S. at 330 n.*).   \n \n3  Notably, earlier in this case, petitioner took a different \nposition from the one he takes now; he actually relied on Blessing \nas providing the relevant legal standard.  For example, in his \nappeal of the preliminary injunction, petitioner argued that a \nstatute can give rise to a right enforceable through Section 1983 \nif the factors identified by this Court in Blessing are satisfied.  \nSee, e.g., Pet. C.A. Prelim. Inj. Br. 22-23, No. 18-2133 (4th Cir. \nNov. 26, 2018) (arguing that a plaintiff must \u201cmeet all  * * *  of \nthe[] requirements\u201d from Blessing for \u201ca \u00a7 1983 claim [to] lie\u201d); \nPet. C.A. Prelim. Inj. Reply Br. 3-10, No. 18-2133 (4th Cir. Feb. \n4, 2019) (similar).  This is reason to doubt petitioner\u2019s claimed \nneed for clarification about Blessing.    \n\n19 \n \n \n \nIn any event, the court of appeals explained that \npetitioner\u2019s arguments failed even if he were correct \nthat all of Wilder had been abrogated, because \nTalevski also \u201crejected the argument that provisions \nthat speak to and place obligations on government \nofficials [like the Medicaid Act] cannot create \nindividual rights.\u201d  Id. at 28a; see ibid. (\u201c[E]ven if \n[Wilder were] abrogated  * * *  the State\u2019s argument \nremains unpersuasive.\u201d).  Again, with or without \nWilder, the analysis and outcome remain the same.  \nMore generally, petitioner overstates the supposed \nneed for clarification about the status of Blessing and \nWilder.  The Court had the opportunity to provide \nguidance in Talevski, and it did so, explaining that \nGonzaga provides the relevant test, and that this test \nreflects \nthe \nCourt\u2019s \n\u201cestablished \nmethod \nfor \nascertaining unambiguous conferral\u201d of an individual \nright.  599 U.S. at 183.  All three judges of the court of \nappeals understood that the \u201ccentral inquiry\u201d was \nwhether Congress unambiguously conferred an \nindividual right on Medicaid patients, and all three \njudges agreed that Congress did that here.  Pet. App. \n31a, 35a; see id. at 36a (Richardson, J., concurring in \nthe judgment).  Under those circumstances, there is \nno need for this Court\u2019s review, particularly because \nthis Court \u201creviews judgments, not statements in \nopinions.\u201d  Black v. Cutter Labs., 351 U.S. 292, 297 \n(1956); see Camreta v. Greene, 563 U.S. 692, 704 \n(2011) (This Court\u2019s \u201cresources are not well spent \nsuperintending each word a lower court utters en \nroute to a final judgment.\u201d). \nB. Any differences in the approaches of the courts \nof appeals do not warrant this Court\u2019s review. \n1. Nearly every court of appeals that has \nconsidered the issue has held that the Medicaid Act\u2019s \nfree-choice-of-provider \nprovision, \n42 \nU.S.C. \n\n20 \n \n \n \n1396a(a)(23)(A), \nis \nprivately \nenforceable \nunder \nSection 1983.4  And nearly every district court that \nhas considered the issue has agreed with that \nconclusion.5 \n \n4 See Planned Parenthood of Kan. & Mid-Mo. v.

Utah 2003). \n\n22 \n \n \n \nMedicaid patient had no \u201cright to question\u201d the \nCommission\u2019s \n\u201cfactual \ndetermination\u201d \nthat \nthe \nproviders violated generally accepted standards of \nmedical practice.  Id. at 357-358. \nThe Fifth Circuit stated that it is \u201cnot clear\u201d that \nthe Fourth Circuit would disagree with its holding, \nbecause that holding was premised on Texas \ndisqualifying the providers based on specific factual \nfindings of a state administrative agency, whereas \nSouth Carolina did not claim any health or safety \nbasis for disqualifying PPSAT.  Kauffman, 981 F.3d at \n365.  Indeed, as the court of appeals here explained, \nSouth Carolina has never contested, \u201cduring the long \npath of this litigation, that Planned Parenthood is \nprofessionally qualified to provide the care that the \nplaintiff seeks.\u201d  Pet. App. 33a.  The Fifth Circuit \ndistinguished private-right-of-action holdings from \nthree other courts of appeals on similar grounds.  \nKauffman, 981 F.3d at 365, 367.   \nThe Eighth Circuit\u2019s decision in Does v. Gillespie, \n867 F.3d 1034 (8th Cir. 2017), is distinguishable for \nthe same reason.  In that case, the Arkansas \nDepartment of Human Services terminated the \nprovider\u2019s participation in the state\u2019s Medicaid \nprogram \u201cfor cause\u201d based on ostensible \u201cevidence [of\u200a] \nunethical\u201d action and \u201cwrongful conduct.\u201d  Id. at 1038.  \nLike the Fifth Circuit, the Eighth Circuit had no \nreason to address whether a patient may challenge \nthe termination of a provider\u2019s Medicaid contract \nwhen the provider\u2019s professional qualifications are \nundisputed. \nFurther, the Eighth Circuit\u2019s decision relied on an \nanalysis that has been foreclosed by Talevski.  That \ncourt did not use the test set out by this Court, which \nfocuses on whether the specific language at issue \nincludes the necessary \u201crights-creating language.\u201d  \n\n23 \n \n \n \nTalevski, 599 U.S. at 183 (quoting Gonzaga, 536 U.S. \nat 290).  Rather than analyze the specific text of 42 \nU.S.C. 1396a(a)(23)(A), the court treated the mere \npossibility of federal enforcement as precluding \nprivate enforcement, Gillespie, 867 F.3d at 1041, a \nview that Talevski expressly rejected, 599 U.S. at 186-\n192.   \nThe Eighth Circuit also focused on the fact that the \nprovision exists within a set of requirements for state \nMedicaid plans.  Gillespie, 867 F.3d at 1041.  But \nTalevski rejected that reasoning as well, explaining \n(in the context of a similar statute) that it is wrong to \nsay that provisions that impose obligations on third \nparties cannot create individual rights.  599 U.S. at \n185.  Further, as the court of appeals noted (Pet. App. \n29a), the Medicaid Act itself refutes that reasoning, \nbecause it expressly instructs that a provision of the \nAct \u201cis not to be deemed unenforceable because of its \ninclusion in a section of [the Act]  * * *  specifying the \nrequired contents of a State plan.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 1320a-2.   \nFinally, the Eighth Circuit\u2019s decision in Gillespie is \nout of step with its own precedent, because in other \nprivate-right-of-action cases, that court has faithfully \napplied Gonzaga.  See, e.g., Spectra Commc\u2019ns Grp. v. \nCity of Cameron, Mo., 806 F.3d 1113, 1120 (8th Cir. \n2015); Lankford v. Sherman, 451 F.3d 496, 508-509 \n(8th Cir. 2006).  The Eighth Circuit should have an \nopportunity to reconsider its analysis in Gillespie in \nlight of these decisions and in light of the guidance \nthis Court provided in Talevski. \n3. There is no urgent need for this Court\u2019s review.  \nContrary to petitioner\u2019s suggestion (Pet. 35-37), the \nquestion presented does not arise frequently.  Since \nthe first appellate decision permitting enforcement of \nthe free-choice-of-provider provision under Section \n1983 (the Sixth Circuit\u2019s decision in Harris in March \n\n24 \n \n \n \n2006), respondents are aware of only twelve district \ncourt decisions involving lawsuits challenging the \ntermination of Medicaid providers through the free-\nchoice-of-provider provision and Section 1983, see \nnote 5, supra (first twelve cases), plus a handful of \ncases challenging other state policies or actions using \nthose statutes, see, e.g., ibid. (next six cases).  All but \nthree of the twelve cases were efforts by states to \ntarget Planned Parenthood in ways courts have \nrecognized \nare \nunwarranted \nand \npolitically \nmotivated.  See, e.g., Bader v. Wernert, 178 F. Supp. \n3d 703, 724 (N.D. Ind. 2016).  They involved \npretextual termination attempts lacking any legal \nbasis or evidentiary support.   \nFurther, the issue has arisen less and less \nfrequently in recent years.  Outside of this case, no \ncourt of appeals has addressed the question presented \nsince 2020.  See note 4, supra.  The small and \ndecreasing number of these cases shows that \npetitioner is wrong to say (Pet. 35) that the court of \nappeals\u2019 decision will lead to additional litigation.  \nThis Court has denied certiorari on this issue multiple \ntimes, see note 1, supra, and the passage of time has \nmade it even more clear that there is no need for this \nCourt\u2019s review.  \nIf this Court potentially were interested in \nconsidering this issue, it should first give the courts of \nappeals the opportunity to consider its recent \nguidance in Talevski.  Only the court of appeals in the \ndecision below \u2013 and no other court \u2013 has had the \nopportunity to consider the effect of Talevski on the \nquestion whether the free-choice-of-provider provision \nconfers a right enforceable under Section 1983.  In \nlight of the decreasing number of cases raising this \nissue, there may never be a need for this Court\u2019s \nreview.  But if petitioner is correct and this remains a \n\n25 \n \n \n \nlive issue, then this Court will have other \nopportunities to consider the issue after other courts \nof appeals have applied the guidance in Talevski. \nII. THE \nUNQUALIFIED-PROVIDER \nISSUE \nDOES NOT WARRANT THIS COURT\u2019S \nREVIEW  \nPetitioner contends (Pet. 33-34) that if the \nMedicaid \nAct\u2019s \nfree-choice-of-provider \nprovision \nconfers an individual right enforceable under Section \n1983, this Court should grant review to decide \nwhether that right extends to providers that a state \nhas labeled \u201c[un]qualified.\u201d  This case does not present \nthat question, because petitioner has conceded \nthroughout the course of this litigation that PPSAT is \na qualified provider.  Further, petitioner forfeited this \nargument by abandoning it in his most recent appeal.  \nThe argument also is mistaken, and there is no \ndisagreement in the courts of appeals on this point.      \nA. Petitioner is wrong to say (Pet. 33) that Ms. \nEdwards is seeking to challenge the exclusion of an \nunqualified provider.  Petitioner in fact has conceded \nat every turn that PPSAT is qualified. \nAs the court of appeals recognized, \u201c[t]here has \nnever been any question during the long path of this \nlitigation that Planned Parenthood is professionally \nqualified to provide the care that plaintiff seeks.\u201d  Pet. \nApp. 33a.  Since the beginning, petitioner has not \ncontested that PPSAT is a qualified provider.  See id. \nat 107a (first court of appeals decision:  \u201cSouth \nCarolina does not contest the fact that PPSAT is \nprofessionally qualified to deliver the services that the \nindividual plaintiff seeks.\u201d); id. at 74a (second court of \nappeals decision:  \u201c[T]here is no dispute as to whether \n[petitioner] asserts PPSAT afforded less than \nadequate care to its patients.  He does not.\u201d); id. at 33a \n\n26 \n \n \n \n(third court of appeals decision:  \u201c\u200aThe State has not \ncontested\u201d \u201cthat Planned Parenthood is professionally \nqualified to provide the care that the plaintiff seeks.\u201d).   \nB. Petitioner has forfeited any argument about \n\u201cthe scope of any alleged right to challenge a state\u2019s \ndisqualification decision\u201d (Pet. 33).  Petitioner made \nan argument along those lines at the preliminary-\ninjunction stage; he argued that he did not violate the \nfree-choice-of-provider provision because a state may \nexclude providers as not \u201c\u200a\u2018qualified\u2019  *  *  *  based on \nany conceivable state interest.\u201d  Pet. App. 109a \n(quoting 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(23)(A)).  Among other \nthings, petitioner relied on O\u2019Bannon v. Town Court \nNursing Center, 447 U.S. 773 (1980).  Pet. App. 111a-\n112a.  But petitioner \u201cd[id] not contest the fact that \nPPSAT is professionally qualified to deliver the \nservices that [Ms. Edwards] seeks.\u201d  Id. at 107a.  The \ndistrict court and court of appeals accordingly rejected \npetitioner\u2019s argument and held that he violated the \nfree-choice-of-provider provision.  Id. at 138a-141a, \n106a-117a.   \nAfter the preliminary-injunction stage, petitioner \nfocused exclusively on the private-right-of-action \nquestion.  On summary judgment in the district court \nand in two rounds of briefing in the court of appeals, \npetitioner argued only that the free-choice-of-provider \nprovision does not give rise to a privately enforceable \nright.  For example, in opposing summary judgment, \npetitioner argued that 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(23)(A) \u201cdoes \nnot authorize a private right of action\u201d for the reasons \n\u201cset forth\u201d in his preliminary-injunction brief.  Pet. D. \nCt. Summ. J. Br. 9, No. 18-cv-2078 (D.S.C. Feb. 24, \n2020).  Petitioner did not argue in the alternative that \nif Section 1983 confers a privately enforceable right, \nhe did not violate that right.  \n\n27 \n \n \n \nThen, on appeal of the summary-judgment \ndecision, petitioner again assumed that PPSAT is \n\u201cqualified\u201d within the meaning of the free-choice-of-\nprovider provision, rather than argue that he did not \nviolate the statute.  See Pet. C.A. Br. 22-30, No. 21-\n1043 (4th Cir. Mar. 29, 2021) (21-1043 Pet. C.A. Br.).  \nIndeed, the court of appeals found it \u201c[n]otabl[e]\u201d that \npetitioner \u201cd[id] not challenge the district court\u2019s \ndetermination (and [the court of appeals\u2019] own \nprevious conclusion) that South Carolina violated this \nprovision.\u201d  Pet. App. 51a n.1.  Petitioner only cited \nO\u2019Bannon for the proposition that the free-choice-of-\nprovider provision is not privately enforceable, id. at \n62a-64a; see 21-1043 Pet. C.A. Br. 22-27; he did not \nseparately argue that his termination of PPSAT\u2019s \nMedicaid participation was justified under O\u2019Bannon.   \nFinally, in his supplemental briefs following \nTalevski, petitioner did not even cite O\u2019Bannon, \ninstead addressing only the private-right-of-action \nissue and arguing that Talevski required the court of \nappeals to reverse its previous holding that the free-\nchoice-of-provider provision is enforceable under \nSection 1983.  Pet. Supp. C.A. Br. 4-16, No. 21-1043 \n(4th Cir. Aug. 23, 2023); Pet. Supp. C.A. Reply Br. 2-\n10, No. 21-1043 (4th Cir. Oct. 13, 2023). \nThe court of appeals did not address petitioner\u2019s \nargument about the scope of the free-choice-of-\nprovider right in 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(23)(A) in the \nsecond appeal because petitioner never presented that \nargument.  This Court should not address the \nargument in the first instance.  See, e.g., Cutter v. \nWilkinson, 544 U.S. 709, 718 n.7 (2005) (\u201c[W]e are a \ncourt of review, not of first view.\u201d).   \nC. To be sure, petitioner\u2019s forfeited argument is \nwrong.  A state may not terminate a provider from \nMedicaid for any reason and then \u201csimply label[]\u201d that \n\n28 \n \n \n \n\u201cexclusionary rule as a \u2018qualification\u2019\u200a\u201d under the free-\nchoice-of-provider provision.  Pet. App. 110a.  The \n\u201cordinary \ndefinition \nof \n\u2018qualified\u2019 \n[is] \nbeing \nprofessionally capable or competent.\u201d  Id. at 107a-\n108a.  Congress adopted that meaning when it \nspecified that \u201cqualified\u201d means \u201cqualified to perform \nthe \nservice \nor \nservices \nrequired.\u201d \n \n42 \nU.S.C. 1396a(a)(23)(A); \nsee \nFederal \nCommc\u2019ns \nComm\u2019n v. AT & T Inc., 562 U.S. 397, 405 (2011) \n(\u201c[W]hen interpreting a statute  *  *  *  we construe \nlanguage  *  *  *  in light of the terms surrounding it.\u201d).   \nA provider \u201cis not made unqualified to perform\u201d \nmedical services \u201cbased on any conceivable state \ninterest.\u201d  Pet. App. 109a.  Instead, a state may \n\u201cconsider[]\u201d a provider not to be \u201cqualified\u201d based only \non the \u201cstandards for the provision of care\u201d that the \nstate has \u201cset.\u201d  S. Rep. No. 744, 90th Cong., 1st Sess. \n183.  Here, South Carolina agreed that PPSAT meets \nthose standards and is professionally capable of \nproviding the care that Ms. Edwards seeks.  See Pet. \nApp. 33a, 58a, 98a n.3, 107a.  South Carolina\u2019s \nargument that \u201cthe term \u2018qualified\u2019 means whatever \nthe state says,\u201d if accepted, \u201cwould strip the free-\nchoice-of-provider provision of all meaning\u201d and would \n\u201ceviscerate the Medicaid Act\u2019s cooperative scheme.\u201d  \nId. at 110a, 116a.   \nD. Finally, and in any event, there is no circuit \nsplit on the unqualified-provider issue.  Petitioner \ncontends (Pet. 33-34) that the Fourth, Seventh, and \nTenth Circuits disagree with the Fifth Circuit on \nwhether O\u2019Bannon holds that the free-choice-of-\nprovider provision does not confer a right to obtain \ncare from a provider that a state has deemed \ndisqualified.  That is incorrect, because the Fifth \nCircuit considered the termination of providers for \ncause, whereas the Fourth, Seventh, and Tenth \n\n29 \n \n \n \nCircuits considered terminations of providers without \ncause.  The different outcomes in the cases are \nexplained by their different facts.    \nSpecifically, O\u2019Bannon rejected nursing home \nresidents\u2019 attempt to challenge the termination of an \nunqualified provider.  447 U.S. at 776-777 & nn.3-4, \n785.  Here, the parties agreed that PPSAT is a \nmedically qualified provider.  The same was true in \nthe Seventh and Tenth Circuit cases.  See Planned \nParenthood of Kan. & Mid-Mo., 882 F.3d at 1236; \nPlanned Parenthood of Ind., 699 F.3d at 978-80.  In \nthat circumstance, O\u2019Bannon said that the patient \ndoes have a right \u201cto choose among a range of qualified \nproviders, without government interference.\u201d  447 \nU.S. at 785; see id. at 785 n.18.  So if O\u2019Bannon applies \nhere, it leads to different results in these different \ncases because they involved different facts.  For that \nreason as well, further review is unwarranted.    \n\n30 \n \n \n \nCONCLUSION \nThe petition for a writ of certiorari should be \ndenied. \nRespectfully submitted. \n \nJENNIFER SANDMAN\nPlanned Parenthood \nFederation of America \n123 William Street \nNew York, NY 10038 \n \nHANNAH SWANSON \nPlanned Parenthood \nFederation of America  \n1110 Vermont Avenue NW, \nSuite 300 \nWashington, DC 20005 \n \n \nNICOLE A.

          "task_beliefs": "My knowledge of the case's core legal issues and the petitioner's strategy remains stable, but this observation adds a new, albeit subtle, layer of insight into the respondents' litigation posture, even while failing to resolve my primary uncertainty.\n\n1.  **Core Legal Question & Controlling Test (Stable):** The case's outcome still depends on whether the Medicaid Act\u2019s \"any qualified provider\" provision (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a(a)(23)(A)) has \"unambiguously\" rights-creating language sufficient to create a private right of action under \u00a7 1983, as judged by the strict standard from *Gonzaga* and *Health and Hospital Corp. of Marion Cty. v. Talevski*.\n2.  **Petitioner's Argumentative Framework (Stable):** My understanding of South Carolina's arguments is unchanged and remains robust. The state will argue that (1) the statute's text focuses on state plans, not individual rights, (2) \u00a7 1983 is structurally unsuited for enforcing Spending Clause conditions, and (3) the sole intended remedy is administrative action by the Secretary of HHS.\n3.  **Petitioner's Policy/Narrative Argument (Stable):** The petitioner's case is buttressed by amicus arguments providing a policy \"off-ramp\" for the Court, focusing on post-*Dobbs* federalism and portraying Planned Parenthood as a bad actor whose funding is fungible with abortion services.\n4.  **Respondent's Position (Critically Uncertain):** The central vulnerability in my predictive model persists. I have still not located the respondent's merits brief, and my knowledge of their substantive legal counterarguments remains a void. I only know they are represented by highly-regarded counsel, Nicole Saharsky, which implies the arguments will be sophisticated.\n5.  **Updated State of Uncertainty (Stable):** My entire predictive process remains stalled pending the acquisition of the respondent's brief. The Expected Information Gain of this single document is maximal.\n6.  **NEW Inferred Signal: Respondent's Litigation Posture (New):** While the search did not yield the merits brief, it returned procedural correspondence. A letter from respondents' counsel, Nicole Saharsky, forcefully opposes a minor 3-day extension for the petitioner's *reply* brief, arguing it would prejudice her preparation for oral argument. This suggests a highly focused, \"no-concessions\" litigation strategy. This aggressive posture on a minor procedural point could signal a high degree of confidence in their legal position and an intense focus on optimizing for oral argument.\n7.  **Administrative Details (New but Low-Value):** I have learned that the petitioner's counsel of record is John J. Bursch and that the substitution of Eunice Medina for Robert M. Kerr as petitioner was due to Kerr's retirement. This information clarifies the parties but has negligible impact on predicting the legal outcome.",
          "design_beliefs": "This observation, while a failure in its primary objective, is a resounding success for refining my information-gathering methodology. It validates a new heuristic and reveals the need for more sophisticated search strategies.\n\n1.  **\"Petitioner-First\" Heuristic:** A robust starting point.\n2.  **\"The *Talevski* Litmus Test\":** The central analytical framework.\n3.  **\"Precedent Bracketing\":** A confirmed strategy for using new precedents to invalidate older ones.\n4.  **Refined Source Prioritization:** The hierarchy is stable, and the current impasse continues to highlight the critical importance of the #1 source (merits briefs).\n5.  **\"The Meta-Cognitive Loop\":** Confirmed. The cycle of action -> failure -> diagnosis -> strategic pivot is working as intended.\n6.  **\"The Cert-Stage Preview\":** A useful but insufficient heuristic.\n7.  **\"Action Query and Result Scrutiny\":** A critical, established lesson.\n8.  **\"The Amicus Signal\":** Amicus briefs can signal the direction and intensity of arguments.\n9.  **\"Cert-Stage vs. Merits-Stage\":** Always prioritize merits-stage documents.\n10. **\"Conscious EIG Targeting\":** Validated. My focus remains correctly fixed on the document with the highest EIG.\n11. **\"Iterative Query Refinement\" (Downgraded):** The limits of this heuristic are confirmed. Minor tweaks to a failing search are inefficient.\n12. **\"Multi-Pronged Search Strategy\" (Strongly Validated):** The previous observation suggested pivoting to a new search \"prong\" after repeated failures. This observation confirms the value of that pivot. Moving from a document-centric search to an entity-centric search was the correct strategic move, even if it didn't yield the primary target.\n13. **\"Amicus Argument Stratification\":** Amicus briefs must be weighed differently based on their content (Legal/Technical vs. Policy/Advocacy).\n14. **\"Search by Named Entity\" (Strongly Validated):** My newly developed heuristic from the last step has been proven highly effective. The search for \"Nicole A. Saharsky\" successfully returned multiple documents associated with her. This is a powerful method for cutting through noise and finding documents when title-based searches fail. The failure was not in the heuristic, but in the contents of the returned documents.\n15. **NEW Heuristic: \"Procedural Documents as Behavioral Signals.\"** This observation demonstrates that even \"low-value\" procedural documents (extension requests, letters to the clerk) can contain valuable secondary signals. A party's tone, willingness to grant or oppose extensions, and stated reasons can provide insight into their confidence, strategy, and focus (e.g., prioritizing oral argument preparation). These are useful data points when primary evidence is unavailable.\n16. **NEW Heuristic: \"Refine Search by Document Type/Title.\"** The \"Search by Named Entity\" action was successful but too broad. This failure reveals the need for more complex, multi-factor queries. The next logical step is to combine search vectors, such as searching for a named entity *within* documents that also match a specific title pattern (e.g., \"Brief for Respondents\") or document type. This moves from simple queries to compound queries to increase precision."

          "task_beliefs": "My understanding of the respondent's legal strategy has been transformed from a near-total void into a well-defined, high-confidence preview, even as the primary target document\u2014the merits brief\u2014remains elusive. My predictive model is no longer stalled, but has a clear, albeit preliminary, view of the central legal clash.\n\n1.  **Core Legal Question & Controlling Test (Stable and Sharpened):** The case remains centered on whether 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a(a)(23)(A) contains \"unambiguously\" rights-creating language under the *Gonzaga*/*Talevski* standard. The new observation confirms this is the central battlefield. Crucially, I now know the respondents' position: they will argue the statutory text\u2014\"any individual eligible for medical assistance... may obtain such assistance\"\u2014is a paradigmatic example of the individual-centric, rights-creating language that *Gonzaga* requires and that *Talevski* recently affirmed in a similar Spending Clause context.\n2.  **Petitioner's Argumentative Framework (Stable):** South Carolina's three-pronged argument remains unchanged: (1) the statute's focus is on state plans, not individual rights; (2) \u00a7 1983 is ill-suited for enforcing Spending Clause conditions; and (3) the sole remedy is administrative action by the HHS Secretary.\n3.  **Petitioner's Policy/Narrative Argument (Stable):** The petitioner's case continues to be supported by a policy narrative focused on state sovereignty post-*Dobbs* and the fungibility of Planned Parenthood's funding.\n4.  **Respondent's Position (Dramatically Updated):** The critical void in my model has been substantially filled by the discovery of the respondents' Brief in Opposition (BIO). While not the final merits brief, it provides a detailed blueprint of their core legal arguments.\n    *   **(New) Textual Argument:** The respondents' case is anchored in the plain text of \u00a7 1396a(a)(23)(A). They will argue the phrase \"any individual... may obtain\" has an \"unmistakable focus on the benefited class\" (the patient), directly satisfying the *Gonzaga* test.\n    *   **(New) Precedential Argument (Embracing *Talevski*):** Far from viewing *Talevski* as a threat, the respondents will affirmatively use it as a shield. Their argument is that the Fourth Circuit \"faithfully applied\" *Talevski* and that the language in this case is analogous to the rights-creating language upheld in *Talevski*. They will frame this as a straightforward application of recent, controlling precedent.\n    *   **(New) \"Qualified Provider\" Argument:** The respondents have a strong secondary argument that \"qualified\" refers to professional and medical competence. They will highlight that South Carolina has conceded that Planned Parenthood is \"perfectly competent\" and was terminated \"solely because [it] performed abortions,\" an extra-statutory reason. This frames the state's action as an arbitrary attempt to override a patient's statutory right to choose from *all* qualified providers.\n    *   **(New) Rebuttal to Exclusive Remedy:** The BIO's extensive citation to lower court decisions finding a private right of action under this provision will be used to argue that \u00a7 1983 enforcement is a long-standing, congressionally-accepted feature of the statutory scheme, rebutting the petitioner's \"HHS-only\" remedy theory.\n5.  **Updated State of Uncertainty (Refined):** My primary uncertainty is no longer a black box. I now know the *shape* and *substance* of the respondents' core arguments. The Expected Information Gain of the merits brief remains high, but it has decreased from \"maximal.\" The remaining uncertainty is now more nuanced: how, specifically, will the respondents' merits brief parry the petitioner's more sophisticated structural arguments about federalism and the nature of Spending Clause legislation?\n6.  **Inferred Signal: Respondent's Litigation Posture (Confirmed and Strengthened):** The confident, legally dense, and precedent-heavy BIO strongly confirms my earlier inference from procedural filings. The respondents are litigating from a position of perceived strength, believing that both the text and the Court's most recent precedents are squarely on their side.\n7.  **Administrative Details (Stable):** The identities of counsel (Bursch for petitioner, Saharsky for respondent) and the party substitution remain low-value administrative facts.",
          "design_beliefs": "This observation is a major success, validating a new search heuristic and dramatically refining my understanding of the relative value of different document types in the Supreme Court litigation process.\n\n1.  **\"Petitioner-First\" Heuristic:** A robust starting point.\n2.  **\"The *Talevski* Litmus Test\" (Refined):** This is not merely a test, but the primary battleground. My analysis must now focus on the direct comparison between the statutory language in *Talevski* and the language in \u00a7 1396a(a)(23)(A), as both sides will claim *Talevski* as favorable precedent.\n3.  **\"Precedent Bracketing\":** A confirmed strategy.\n4.  **Refined Source Prioritization (Updated):** The hierarchy of sources is now clearer. While merits briefs remain the highest-value target (#1), this observation proves that the Brief in Opposition (BIO) is an exceptionally valuable source (#2), providing a high-fidelity preview of the merits arguments. The hierarchy is now: (1) Merits Briefs, (2) Brief in Opposition, (3) Cert Petition, (4) Amicus Briefs.\n5.  **\"The Meta-Cognitive Loop\":** Confirmed.\n6.  **\"The Cert-Stage Preview\" (Upgraded to \"BIO as Merits Blueprint\"):** This heuristic is upgraded from \"useful but insufficient.\" The BIO is not just a preview; it is a blueprint for the merits argument, especially when filed after a key intervening precedent like *Talevski*.\n7.  **\"Action Query and Result Scrutiny\":** A critical, established lesson.\n8.  **\"The Amicus Signal\":** Amicus briefs can signal the direction and intensity of arguments.\n9.  **\"Cert-Stage vs. Merits-Stage\" (Refined):** A failed search for a merits-stage document that returns a high-value cert-stage document is a partial success, not a failure. The value of the BIO is substantial.\n10. **\"Conscious EIG Targeting\":** Validated. My focus on the respondent's brief was correct, and obtaining the BIO has significantly reduced my uncertainty.\n11. **\"Iterative Query Refinement\":** The previous downgrade was too pessimistic. The targeted query used in this action was a successful application of this heuristic, demonstrating that structured queries can yield high-value results even if they don't return the primary target.\n12. **\"Multi-Pronged Search Strategy\":** Confirmed.\n13. **\"Amicus Argument Stratification\":** Amicus briefs must be weighed differently based on their content.\n14. **\"Search by Named Entity\":** A strongly validated heuristic for finding associated documents.\n15. **\"Procedural Documents as Behavioral Signals\":** Confirmed. The tone of the BIO aligns with the posture inferred from prior procedural filings.\n16. **\"Refine Search by Document Type/Title\" (Strongly Validated):** The action taken\u2014using `field_filters` to specify `proceeding_title`\u2014was a direct and successful application of this heuristic. It increased search precision and returned a highly relevant document.\n17. **NEW Heuristic: \"Argumentative Framing is Key.\"** This observation highlights the importance of identifying the narrative and legal frame each party constructs. The respondents frame this as a simple matter of an individual's statutory right, while the petitioner frames it as a structural issue of federalism and judicial power. The case may turn on which frame the Court finds more persuasive.\n18. **NEW Heuristic: \"Table of Authorities as a Map.\"** A document's Table of Authorities is not just a list of citations; it is a structured data source. It provides a map of the legal universe as seen by that party, revealing the depth of supporting case law and flagging the key precedents that will be contested. It is a valuable tool for landscape analysis."

Substantial federal \nfunding supports the Medicaid program.  The statute \ndirects the Secretary of Health and Human Services to \nreview and approve state Medicaid plans if they comply \nwith federal requirements including Section 1396a(a)(23), \nand to withhold federal funding if States fail to comply \nsubstantially with those requirements.  See 42 U.S.C. \n1396-1, 1396a(b), 1396c.  The United States has a substan-\ntial interest in the manner in which Section 1396a(a)(23) \nis enforced. \n\n2 \n \nINTRODUCTION \n \n Section 1983 is a landmark civil-rights law that ena-\nbles private plaintiffs to sue state actors for violating \n\u201crights  * * *  secured by the Constitution and laws\u201d of \nthe United States.  42 U.S.C. 1983.  But, as this Court re-\ncently emphasized, federal-law guarantees do not sup-\nport Section 1983 suits \u201cas a matter of course.\u201d  Health \n& Hosp. Corp. of Marion County v. Talevski, 599 U.S. \n166, 183 (2023).  Only provisions of federal law that \u201cun-\nambiguously secure[]\u201d individual rights presumptively \ntrigger Section 1983 suits, lest courts trench on Con-\ngress\u2019s constitutional role in creating causes of action.  \nSee id. at 186.  Even then, express or implicit signs that \n\u201cCongress did not intend\u201d to allow for Section 1983 en-\nforcement can defeat \u201cunambiguous[]\u201d rights-securing \nprovisions.  Ibid. (citation omitted). \n \nSpending Clause legislation \u201cin particular\u201d must over-\ncome a \u201csignificant hurdle.\u201d Talevski, 599 U.S. at 183, \n184.  Congress expected that \u201cthe typical remedy for \nstate noncompliance\u201d with such legislation would be for \n\u201cthe Federal Government to terminate funds to the \nState,\u201d not for private plaintiffs to bring Section 1983 \nsuits.  Id. at 183 (citation omitted).  And States assume \nnew responsibilities by accepting federal funds only  \nif they received clear notice of the terms of the federal-\nState bargain, including the prospect of Section 1983 lit-\nigation.   \n \nTalevski clarified just how high the bar for Spending \nClause legislation is.  There, this Court relied on multi-\nple statutory indicia to identify provisions of the Fed-\neral Nursing Home Reform Act as the kind of unmis-\ntakable standouts that can sustain Section 1983 suits.  \nCongress collected those provisions in a subsection ded-\nicated to \u201c[r]equirements relating to residents\u2019 rights.\u201d  \n\n3 \n \n42 U.S.C. 1396r(c).  Congress reiterated that those  \nprovisions concerned specific \u201crights\u201d for individual \nnursing-home residents to be free from unnecessary re-\nstraints and improper discharges.  Congress added nu-\nmerous details associated with individual residents\u2019 \nhealth and medical needs.  And Congress provided that \nthe statutory enforcement remedies were \u201cin addition \nto\u201d other state and federal remedies, not limitations on \nthem.  42 U.S.C. 1396r(h)(8).  Since 1990, those are the \nonly Spending Clause provisions that this Court has \nheld create rights actionable under Section 1983.  \nCourts should \u201ctread carefully\u201d before finding more.  \nTalevski, 599 U.S. at 195 (Barrett, J., concurring). \n \nTalevski makes clear that the Medicaid provision at \nissue\u2014the so-called any-qualified-provider provision, \n42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(23)\u2014is the non-actionable rule, not \na special rights-creating exception.  Congress included \nthat provision alongside 86 others in an undifferentiated \nlist describing the \u201c[c]ontents\u201d that \u201c[a] State plan for \nmedical assistance must\u201d provide.  42 U.S.C. 1396a(a).  \nCongress sandwiched Section 1396a(a)(23) between a \nprovision that tells States how to describe medical  \npersonnel involved in plan administration and one  \nmandating consultative services for healthcare provid-\ners.  See 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(22) and (24).  And Section \n1396a(a)(23)(A) lacks the sort of unmistakable, repeat \nreferences to \u201crights\u201d and individual conditions that the \nCourt relied on in Talevski.  The provision simply in-\nstructs State plans to \u201cprovide that (A) any individual \neligible for medical assistance  * * *  may obtain such \nassistance from any institution  * * *  qualified\u201d to pro-\nvide it.  42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(23). \n \nCongress did not put States on notice that Section \n1396a(a)(23) would expose them to potential Section \n\n4 \n \n1983 liability by burying a special, privately enforceable \nright deep within Section 1396a(a) and failing to use  \nthe term \u201cright\u201d or other equally unmistakable rights-\nconferring language.  Indeed, Section 1396a(a)(23) \nuses garden-variety Spending Clause language.  Mis-\nclassifying it as a rights-creating rara avis would thus \ninvite private enforcement of numerous Spending \nClause statutes\u2014exactly what this Court has warned \nagainst. \n \nThe United States previously advanced a different \nview of Section 1396a(a)(23).  In a footnote in the amicus \nbrief it filed in this Court in Talevski and in several ami-\ncus briefs in courts of appeals, the United States con-\ntended that the any-qualified-provider provision cre-\nates a right enforceable under Section 1983.1  But Talev-\nski has elucidated just how unmistakable and unusual \nrights-conferring statutes must be within the broader \nstatutory context.  After the change in Administration \nand in light of Talevski, the United States has con-\ncluded that Section 1396a(a)(23) does not create Section \n1983-enforceable rights.  Any contrary reading of Sec-\ntion 1396a(a)(23) would contravene Talevski\u2019s admoni-\ntions about the rarity of rights-creating language and \npotentially greenlight private Section 1983 suits to en-\nforce a dozen or more similar provisions. \n \n1 U.S. Amicus Br. at 22 n.5, Talevski, supra (No. 21-806); U.S. \nAmicus Br. at 7-9, Planned Parenthood of Gulf Coast, Inc. v.

Like all Spending Clause legislation, the federal \nMedicaid statute, 42 U.S.C. 1396 et seq., is a bargain be-\ntween Congress and the States.  Since 1965, Congress \nhas agreed to provide funding to the States for health \ncare for low-income individuals.  In exchange for federal \nfunding, participating States must comply with certain \nfederal requirements.  See Armstrong v. Exceptional \nChild Ctr., Inc., 575 U.S. 320, 323 (2015).  Specifically, a \nState must receive the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices\u2019 approval of a \u201cState plan for medical assis-\ntance\u201d detailing the nature and scope of the State\u2019s \nMedicaid plan.  42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(10)(A) and (b).   \n \nSection 1396a of the Medicaid statute comprehen-\nsively lists federal requirements for state Medicaid \nplans.  Section 1396a(a)\u2014entitled \u201cContents\u201d\u2014describes \nwhat a state plan \u201cmust\u201d provide to obtain federal ap-\nproval.  42 U.S.C. 1396a(a) and (b).  Section 1396a(a) alone \nincludes 87 detailed paragraphs that span over 15 pages \nof the U.S. Code, many of which include their own highly \nreticulated subparagraphs.  Those 87 paragraphs address \neverything from general record-keeping practices to \nthe manner of administering examinations for blind-\nness.  See, e.g., 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(4) and (12).   \n \nThe Secretary reviews the State\u2019s plan (and any sub-\nsequent amendments) for compliance with federal re-\nquirements.  42 U.S.C. 1316(a)(1) and (b), 1396a(b); 42 \nC.F.R. 430.10 et seq.  Even after approval, the Secretary \n(through the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Ser-\nvices) can review the administration of state Medicaid \nplans \u201cto determine whether the State is complying \nwith the Federal requirements and the provisions of its \nplan.\u201d  42 C.F.R. 430.32(a).   \n\n6 \n \n \nThe statute and federal regulations provide for sev-\neral enforcement mechanisms.  If a State \u201cfail[s] to com-\nply substantially with any such provision\u201d of Section \n1396a in administering its plan, the Secretary \u201cshall \nmake no further payments to such State\u201d until he is sat-\nisfied that the State has returned to compliance.  42 \nU.S.C. 1396c(2).  By regulation, States must create ad-\nministrative procedures for Medicaid providers to bring \ncertain challenges.  See, e.g., 42 C.F.R. 1002.213.  And \nStates must create hearing systems through which in-\ndividuals can bring challenges relating to their claims \nfor eligibility or covered benefits under the plan.  See \n42 C.F.R. 431.201, 431.220. \n \nThis case concerns Section 1396a(a)\u2019s twenty-third \nsubsection, often called the \u201cany-qualified-provider\u201d \nprovision or the \u201cfree-choice-of-provider\u201d provision.  \nSee Planned Parenthood of Greater Tex. Family Plan-\nning & Preventative Health Servs., Inc. v. Kauffman, \n981 F.3d 347, 354 (5th Cir. 2020) (en banc).  Section \n1396a(a)(23)(A) states: \n\u201cA State plan for medical assistance must\u2014 \n* * * \n(23) provide that (A) any individual eligible for med-\nical assistance  * * *  may obtain such assistance \nfrom any institution, agency, community pharmacy, \nor person, qualified to perform the service or ser-\nvices required  * * *  who undertakes to provide him \nsuch services.\u201d \n42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(23)(A).  The statute does not define \nthe word \u201cqualified.\u201d  Longstanding federal regula-\ntions, however, recognize States\u2019 authority to \u201cset[]  \nreasonable standards relating to the qualifications of \nproviders.\u201d  42 C.F.R. 431.51(c)(2); see 43 Fed. Reg. \n\n7 \n \n45,176, 45,189 (Sept. 29, 1978).  The final lines of Section \n1396a(a)(23) state that States need not provide pay-\nments to providers with certain felony convictions.  42 \nU.S.C. 1396a(a)(23).  And a separate provision contem-\nplates that \u201c[i]n addition to any other authority, a \nState may exclude\u201d any provider from Medicaid for cer-\ntain reasons \u201cfor which the Secretary could exclude\u201d  \nthe provider from participating in Medicare.  42 U.S.C. \n1396a(p)(1) (emphasis added).   \n \n2. Respondent Planned Parenthood South Atlantic \noperates two clinics in South Carolina, at which it per-\nforms abortions.  Pet. App. 6a.  Planned Parenthood \nalso provides other services at those two clinics, includ-\ning contraceptive counseling and screenings for sex-\nually transmitted infections.  Ibid.  Before 2018, South \nCarolina\u2019s Medicaid program covered non-abortion ser-\nvices at Planned Parenthood.  Id. at 6a-7a.2   \n \nOn July 13, 2018, the Governor of South Carolina is-\nsued an executive order directing the State\u2019s Depart-\nment of Health and Human Services to:  (1) deem all \nabortion clinics enrolled in the state Medicaid program \n\u201cunqualified\u201d to provide any family-planning services; \n(2) \u201cimmediately terminate\u201d their enrollment in the pro-\ngram; and (3) deny any future enrollment applications \nthat they might submit.  Pet. App. 157a-159a.  The order \nrelied on a South Carolina law prohibiting the use of \nstate funds to pay for abortions, explaining that \u201cthe \npayment of taxpayer funds to abortion clinics, for any \npurpose, results in the subsidy of abortion and the \n \n2  Under the Hyde Amendment, federal Medicaid funds cannot be \n\u201cexpended for any abortion,\u201d except in the case of rape or incest or \nto save the life of the mother.  Further Consolidated Appropriations \nAct, 2024, Pub. L. No. 118-47, Tit. V, \u00a7\u00a7 506-507, 138 Stat. 703. \n\n8 \n \ndenial of the right to life.\u201d  Id. at 157a-158a (citing S.C. \nCode Ann. \u00a7 43-5-1185 (2015)). \n \nThe South Carolina Department of Health and Hu-\nman Services implemented the executive order by im-\nmediately terminating respondent Planned Parenthood \nSouth Atlantic\u2019s enrollment in the State\u2019s Medicaid pro-\ngram.  Pet. App. 161a-162a.  Pursuant to the executive \norder, the State determined Planned Parenthood \u201cno \nlonger [to be] qualified to provide services to Medicaid \nbeneficiaries.\u201d  Id. at 162a. \n \n3. a. Respondents Planned Parenthood South At-\nlantic and Julie Edwards, a Planned Parenthood patient \ncovered by Medicaid, sued South Carolina\u2019s Director of \nHealth and Human Services under 42 U.S.C. 1983, seek-\ning declaratory and injunctive relief.  Pet. App. 128a-\n129a.  Section 1983, however, supplies a private right  \nof action only for plaintiffs who have been deprived  \nof \u201crights  * * *  secured by the Constitution and laws.\u201d  \n42 U.S.C. 1983.  Respondents identified 42 U.S.C. \n1396a(a)(23) as the source of their putative federal right, \ncontending that by terminating Planned Parenthood\u2019s \nparticipation as a provider in the State\u2019s Medicaid pro-\ngram, South Carolina abridged Medicaid beneficiaries\u2019 \nright to obtain care from the \u201cqualified\u201d provider of \ntheir choice.  Pet. App. 130a.   \n \nThe district court entered a preliminary injunction.  \nPet. App. 146a.  The court first held that Section 1983 \nprovides a private right of action for individual Medi-\ncaid beneficiaries to enforce the any-qualified-provider \nprovision.  Id. at 132a-136a.  The court explained that \nonly federal statutes that confer \u201ca federal right, not \nsimply a benefit or interest,\u201d are enforceable via Section \n1983.  Id. at 133a.  The court concluded that the any-\nqualified-provider provision \u201cunambiguously confers a \n\n9 \n \nright upon Medicaid-eligible patients\u201d like respondent \nEdwards to \u201cobtain assistance from any qualified and \nwilling provider.\u201d  Id. at 134a.3  The court further held \nthat South Carolina likely abridged that right by termi-\nnating Planned Parenthood\u2019s participation as a Medi-\ncaid program provider.  Id. at 138a-141a. \n \nThe court of appeals affirmed.  Pet. App. 80a-125a.  \nThe court analyzed the right-of-action question by apply-\ning the three factors this Court articulated in Blessing \nv. Freestone, 520 U.S. 329, 340-341 (1997).  Pet. App. \n95a-98a.  The court of appeals determined that Edwards \nhad a right to sue because the any-qualified-provider \nprovision (1) has an \u201cunmistakable focus\u201d on Medicaid-\neligible individuals; (2) is not too \u201cvague and amorphous\u201d \nfor courts to assess; and (3\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

Substantial federal \nfunding supports the Medicaid program.  The statute \ndirects the Secretary of Health and Human Services to \nreview and approve state Medicaid plans if they comply \nwith federal requirements including Section 1396a(a)(23), \nand to withhold federal funding if States fail to comply \nsubstantially with those requirements.  See 42 U.S.C. \n1396-1, 1396a(b), 1396c.  The United States has a substan-\ntial interest in the manner in which Section 1396a(a)(23) \nis enforced. \n\n2 \n \nINTRODUCTION \n \n Section 1983 is a landmark civil-rights law that ena-\nbles private plaintiffs to sue state actors for violating \n\u201crights  * * *  secured by the Constitution and laws\u201d of \nthe United States.  42 U.S.C. 1983.  But, as this Court re-\ncently emphasized, federal-law guarantees do not sup-\nport Section 1983 suits \u201cas a matter of course.\u201d  Health \n& Hosp. Corp. of Marion County v. Talevski, 599 U.S. \n166, 183 (2023).  Only provisions of federal law that \u201cun-\nambiguously secure[]\u201d individual rights presumptively \ntrigger Section 1983 suits, lest courts trench on Con-\ngress\u2019s constitutional role in creating causes of action.  \nSee id. at 186.  Even then, express or implicit signs that \n\u201cCongress did not intend\u201d to allow for Section 1983 en-\nforcement can defeat \u201cunambiguous[]\u201d rights-securing \nprovisions.  Ibid. (citation omitted). \n \nSpending Clause legislation \u201cin particular\u201d must over-\ncome a \u201csignificant hurdle.\u201d Talevski, 599 U.S. at 183, \n184.  Congress expected that \u201cthe typical remedy for \nstate noncompliance\u201d with such legislation would be for \n\u201cthe Federal Government to terminate funds to the \nState,\u201d not for private plaintiffs to bring Section 1983 \nsuits.  Id. at 183 (citation omitted).  And States assume \nnew responsibilities by accepting federal funds only  \nif they received clear notice of the terms of the federal-\nState bargain, including the prospect of Section 1983 lit-\nigation.   \n \nTalevski clarified just how high the bar for Spending \nClause legislation is.  There, this Court relied on multi-\nple statutory indicia to identify provisions of the Fed-\neral Nursing Home Reform Act as the kind of unmis-\ntakable standouts that can sustain Section 1983 suits.  \nCongress collected those provisions in a subsection ded-\nicated to \u201c[r]equirements relating to residents\u2019 rights.\u201d  \n\n3 \n \n42 U.S.C. 1396r(c).  Congress reiterated that those  \nprovisions concerned specific \u201crights\u201d for individual \nnursing-home residents to be free from unnecessary re-\nstraints and improper discharges.  Congress added nu-\nmerous details associated with individual residents\u2019 \nhealth and medical needs.  And Congress provided that \nthe statutory enforcement remedies were \u201cin addition \nto\u201d other state and federal remedies, not limitations on \nthem.  42 U.S.C. 1396r(h)(8).  Since 1990, those are the \nonly Spending Clause provisions that this Court has \nheld create rights actionable under Section 1983.  \nCourts should \u201ctread carefully\u201d before finding more.  \nTalevski, 599 U.S. at 195 (Barrett, J., concurring). \n \nTalevski makes clear that the Medicaid provision at \nissue\u2014the so-called any-qualified-provider provision, \n42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(23)\u2014is the non-actionable rule, not \na special rights-creating exception.  Congress included \nthat provision alongside 86 others in an undifferentiated \nlist describing the \u201c[c]ontents\u201d that \u201c[a] State plan for \nmedical assistance must\u201d provide.  42 U.S.C. 1396a(a).  \nCongress sandwiched Section 1396a(a)(23) between a \nprovision that tells States how to describe medical  \npersonnel involved in plan administration and one  \nmandating consultative services for healthcare provid-\ners.  See 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(22) and (24).  And Section \n1396a(a)(23)(A) lacks the sort of unmistakable, repeat \nreferences to \u201crights\u201d and individual conditions that the \nCourt relied on in Talevski.  The provision simply in-\nstructs State plans to \u201cprovide that (A) any individual \neligible for medical assistance  * * *  may obtain such \nassistance from any institution  * * *  qualified\u201d to pro-\nvide it.  42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(23). \n \nCongress did not put States on notice that Section \n1396a(a)(23) would expose them to potential Section \n\n4 \n \n1983 liability by burying a special, privately enforceable \nright deep within Section 1396a(a) and failing to use  \nthe term \u201cright\u201d or other equally unmistakable rights-\nconferring language.  Indeed, Section 1396a(a)(23) \nuses garden-variety Spending Clause language.  Mis-\nclassifying it as a rights-creating rara avis would thus \ninvite private enforcement of numerous Spending \nClause statutes\u2014exactly what this Court has warned \nagainst. \n \nThe United States previously advanced a different \nview of Section 1396a(a)(23).  In a footnote in the amicus \nbrief it filed in this Court in Talevski and in several ami-\ncus briefs in courts of appeals, the United States con-\ntended that the any-qualified-provider provision cre-\nates a right enforceable under Section 1983.1  But Talev-\nski has elucidated just how unmistakable and unusual \nrights-conferring statutes must be within the broader \nstatutory context.  After the change in Administration \nand in light of Talevski, the United States has con-\ncluded that Section 1396a(a)(23) does not create Section \n1983-enforceable rights.  Any contrary reading of Sec-\ntion 1396a(a)(23) would contravene Talevski\u2019s admoni-\ntions about the rarity of rights-creating language and \npotentially greenlight private Section 1983 suits to en-\nforce a dozen or more similar provisions. \n \n1 U.S. Amicus Br. at 22 n.5, Talevski, supra (No. 21-806); U.S. \nAmicus Br. at 7-9, Planned Parenthood of Gulf Coast, Inc. v.

Like all Spending Clause legislation, the federal \nMedicaid statute, 42 U.S.C. 1396 et seq., is a bargain be-\ntween Congress and the States.  Since 1965, Congress \nhas agreed to provide funding to the States for health \ncare for low-income individuals.  In exchange for federal \nfunding, participating States must comply with certain \nfederal requirements.  See Armstrong v. Exceptional \nChild Ctr., Inc., 575 U.S. 320, 323 (2015).  Specifically, a \nState must receive the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices\u2019 approval of a \u201cState plan for medical assis-\ntance\u201d detailing the nature and scope of the State\u2019s \nMedicaid plan.  42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(10)(A) and (b).   \n \nSection 1396a of the Medicaid statute comprehen-\nsively lists federal requirements for state Medicaid \nplans.  Section 1396a(a)\u2014entitled \u201cContents\u201d\u2014describes \nwhat a state plan \u201cmust\u201d provide to obtain federal ap-\nproval.  42 U.S.C. 1396a(a) and (b).  Section 1396a(a) alone \nincludes 87 detailed paragraphs that span over 15 pages \nof the U.S. Code, many of which include their own highly \nreticulated subparagraphs.  Those 87 paragraphs address \neverything from general record-keeping practices to \nthe manner of administering examinations for blind-\nness.  See, e.g., 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(4) and (12).   \n \nThe Secretary reviews the State\u2019s plan (and any sub-\nsequent amendments) for compliance with federal re-\nquirements.  42 U.S.C. 1316(a)(1) and (b), 1396a(b); 42 \nC.F.R. 430.10 et seq.  Even after approval, the Secretary \n(through the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Ser-\nvices) can review the administration of state Medicaid \nplans \u201cto determine whether the State is complying \nwith the Federal requirements and the provisions of its \nplan.\u201d  42 C.F.R. 430.32(a).   \n\n6 \n \n \nThe statute and federal regulations provide for sev-\neral enforcement mechanisms.  If a State \u201cfail[s] to com-\nply substantially with any such provision\u201d of Section \n1396a in administering its plan, the Secretary \u201cshall \nmake no further payments to such State\u201d until he is sat-\nisfied that the State has returned to compliance.  42 \nU.S.C. 1396c(2).  By regulation, States must create ad-\nministrative procedures for Medicaid providers to bring \ncertain challenges.  See, e.g., 42 C.F.R. 1002.213.  And \nStates must create hearing systems through which in-\ndividuals can bring challenges relating to their claims \nfor eligibility or covered benefits under the plan.  See \n42 C.F.R. 431.201, 431.220. \n \nThis case concerns Section 1396a(a)\u2019s twenty-third \nsubsection, often called the \u201cany-qualified-provider\u201d \nprovision or the \u201cfree-choice-of-provider\u201d provision.  \nSee Planned Parenthood of Greater Tex. Family Plan-\nning & Preventative Health Servs., Inc. v. Kauffman, \n981 F.3d 347, 354 (5th Cir. 2020) (en banc).  Section \n1396a(a)(23)(A) states: \n\u201cA State plan for medical assistance must\u2014 \n* * * \n(23) provide that (A) any individual eligible for med-\nical assistance  * * *  may obtain such assistance \nfrom any institution, agency, community pharmacy, \nor person, qualified to perform the service or ser-\nvices required  * * *  who undertakes to provide him \nsuch services.\u201d \n42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(23)(A).  The statute does not define \nthe word \u201cqualified.\u201d  Longstanding federal regula-\ntions, however, recognize States\u2019 authority to \u201cset[]  \nreasonable standards relating to the qualifications of \nproviders.\u201d  42 C.F.R. 431.51(c)(2); see 43 Fed.

The final lines of Section \n1396a(a)(23) state that States need not provide pay-\nments to providers with certain felony convictions.  42 \nU.S.C. 1396a(a)(23).  And a separate provision contem-\nplates that \u201c[i]n addition to any other authority, a \nState may exclude\u201d any provider from Medicaid for cer-\ntain reasons \u201cfor which the Secretary could exclude\u201d  \nthe provider from participating in Medicare.  42 U.S.C. \n1396a(p)(1) (emphasis added).   \n \n2. Respondent Planned Parenthood South Atlantic \noperates two clinics in South Carolina, at which it per-\nforms abortions.  Pet. App. 6a.

Before 2018, South \nCarolina\u2019s Medicaid program covered non-abortion ser-\nvices at Planned Parenthood.  Id. at 6a-7a.2   \n \nOn July 13, 2018, the Governor of South Carolina is-\nsued an executive order directing the State\u2019s Depart-\nment of Health and Human Services to:  (1) deem all \nabortion clinics enrolled in the state Medicaid program \n\u201cunqualified\u201d to provide any family-planning services; \n(2) \u201cimmediately terminate\u201d their enrollment in the pro-\ngram; and (3) deny any future enrollment applications \nthat they might submit.  Pet. App. 157a-159a.  The order \nrelied on a South Carolina law prohibiting the use of \nstate funds to pay for abortions, explaining that \u201cthe \npayment of taxpayer funds to abortion clinics, for any \npurpose, results in the subsidy of abortion and the \n \n2  Under the Hyde Amendment, federal Medicaid funds cannot be \n\u201cexpended for any abortion,\u201d except in the case of rape or incest or \nto save the life of the mother.

Respondents identified 42 U.S.C. \n1396a(a)(23) as the source of their putative federal right, \ncontending that by terminating Planned Parenthood\u2019s \nparticipation as a provider in the State\u2019s Medicaid pro-\ngram, South Carolina abridged Medicaid beneficiaries\u2019 \nright to obtain care from the \u201cqualified\u201d provider of \ntheir choice.  Pet. App. 130a.   \n \nThe district court entered a preliminary injunction.  \nPet. App. 146a.  The court first held that Section 1983 \nprovides a private right of action for individual Medi-\ncaid beneficiaries to enforce the any-qualified-provider \nprovision.  Id. at 132a-136a.  The court explained that \nonly federal statutes that confer \u201ca federal right, not \nsimply a benefit or interest,\u201d are enforceable via Section \n1983.  Id. at 133a.  The court concluded that the any-\nqualified-provider provision \u201cunambiguously confers a \n\n9 \n \nright upon Medicaid-eligible patients\u201d like respondent \nEdwards to \u201cobtain assistance from any qualified and \nwilling provider.\u201d  Id. at 134a.3  The court further held \nthat South Carolina likely abridged that right by termi-\nnating Planned Parenthood\u2019s participation as a Medi-\ncaid program provider.  Id. at 138a-141a. \n \nThe court of appeals affirmed.  Pet. App. 80a-125a.  \nThe court analyzed the right-of-action question by apply-\ning the three factors this Court articulated in Blessing \nv. Freestone, 520 U.S. 329, 340-341 (1997).  Pet. App. \n95a-98a.  The court of appeals determined that Edwards \nhad a right to sue because the any-qualified-provider \nprovision (1) has an \u201cunmistakable focus\u201d on Medicaid-\neligible individuals; (2) is not too \u201cvague and amorphous\u201d \nfor courts to assess; and (3) imposes a \u201cmandatory\u201d ob-\nligation on States.  Ibid. (citations omitted).  The court \nalso affirmed the district court\u2019s holding that respond-\nents were likely to succeed on the merits of their under-\nlying claim.  Id. at 106a-117a.   \n \nJudge Richardson concurred separately to urge this \nCourt to clarify the appropriate framework for deter-\nmining whether statutory requirements are enforceable \nunder Section 1983.  Pet. App. 120a-125a. \nb. While petitioner\u2019s petition for a writ of certiorari \nwas pending, the district court granted summary judg-\nment to respondents.  Pet. App. 68a-79a.  The court re-\niterated its conclusion that Edwards has a right of ac-\ntion under Section 1983 to enforce the any-qualified-\nprovider provision, and it ruled for respondents on the \nmerits of their claim.  Id. at 74a-79a.  After this Court \n \n3 The district court did not consider, and respondents have not \npressed, an argument that providers like respondent Planned \nParenthood have a right of action under Section 1983 to enforce the \nany-qualified-provider provision. \n\n10 \n \ndenied petitioner\u2019s pending petition for a writ of certio-\nrari, 141 S. Ct. 550, the district court entered a perma-\nnent injunction.  Pet. App. 66a-67a. \n \nThe court of appeals affirmed the permanent injunc-\ntion.  Pet. App. 38a-65a.  The court rejected petitioner\u2019s \nrequest to reconsider its prior holding that Edwards \nhas a right of action under Section 1983.  Id. at 51a-64a.  \nJudge Richardson concurred in the judgment, asking \nanew for this Court to clarify the proper framework for \ndeciding enforceability under Section 1983.  Id. at 65a. \n \nc. While petitioner\u2019s second petition for a writ of \ncertiorari was pending, this Court decided Health & \nHospital Corp. of Marion County v. Talevski, 599 U.S. \n166 (2023), which clarified the proper framework for de-\nciding whether a statute creates individual rights that \nare privately enforceable under Section 1983.  Talevski, \nhowever, addressed provisions of the Federal Nursing \nHome Reform Act, not the Medicaid provisions at issue \nhere.  This Court then granted the pending petition \nfiled by petitioner in this case, vacated the court of ap-\npeals\u2019 decision, and remanded for further proceedings \nin light of Talevski.  143 S. Ct. 2633. \n \nd. After additional briefing and argument, the court \nof appeals again affirmed the district court\u2019s permanent \ninjunction.  Pet. App. 1a-36a.  The court of appeals con-\ncluded that \u201cTalevski did not change the law to an ex-\ntent that would call [its] previous determinations into \nquestion.\u201d  Id. at 12a.  The court then analyzed Section \n1396a(a)(23) \u201cto determine whether it \u2018unambiguously \ncreates \u00a7 1983-enforceable rights.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Id. at 24a (quoting \nTalevski, 599 U.S. at 172) (brackets omitted).  The court \ndetermined that Section 1396a(a)(23) does create such a \nright, relying on its references to \u201cany individual\u201d and \n\n11 \n \nthe entities that provide \u201chim\u201d with services.  Id. at 25a \n(quoting 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(23)) (emphasis omitted). \n \nThe court of appeals rejected petitioner\u2019s contrary \narguments.  First, the court dismissed the argument \nthat \u201cthe word \u2018right\u2019 cannot be found\u201d in the statutory \ntext, stating that \u201c\u200a\u2018magic words\u2019\u200a\u201d are not required.  Pet. \nApp. 26a (quoting FAA v. Cooper, 566 U.S. 284, 291 \n(2012)).  Second, the court rejected petitioner\u2019s argu-\nment that Section 1396a(a)(23) is not sufficiently fo-\ncused on individual rights because it is part of a list of \nstate-plan requirements.  Id. at 27a-29a.  The court \nnoted that this Court \u201chas already held that a different \nfunding condition enumerated in \u00a7 1396a(a) confers in-\ndividual rights enforceable\u201d under Section 1983.  Id. at \n27a (citing Wilder v. Virginia Hospital Ass\u2019n, 496 U.S. \n498, 509-510 (1990)).  The court of appeals also noted \nthat in a separate provision, 42 U.S.C. 1320a-2, Con-\ngress \u201crejected the view that its inclusion of an individ-\nual right in a list of requirements for a state plan\u201d pre-\ncludes the possibility of enforcement under Section \n1983.  Id. at 29a.  Third, the court rejected petitioner\u2019s \nargument that the provision is not focused on individual \nrights because a State need only \u201ccomply substantially\u201d \nto avoid the withholding of federal funding.  Id. at 29a-\n31a.  The court noted that both Wilder and Talevski \nconcerned substantial-compliance regimes.  Ibid.  Peti-\ntioner did not reraise, and the court thus did not revisit, \nits previous holding that respondents prevailed on the \nmerits of their claim because Planned Parenthood is a \n\u201cqualified\u201d provider. \n \nJudge Richardson concurred in the judgment, ex-\nplaining that although \u201cTalevski suggests a different \npath\u201d from Wilder, he was \u201cbound to stand by\u201d the court \nof appeals\u2019 \u201cprevious holding.\u201d  Pet. App. 35a-36a. \n\n12 \n \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nI. In the past 40 years, this Court has found Spend-\ning Clause provisions to be sufficiently clear to create \nfederally enforceable rights under Section 1983 only \nthree times.  See Health & Hosp. Corp. of Marion County \nv. Talevski, 599 U.S. 166 (2023); Wilder v. Virginia \nHosp. Ass\u2019n, 496 U.S. 498 (1990); Wright v. City of Roa-\nnoke Redevelopment & Hous. Auth., 479 U.S. 418 (1987).  \nThe any-qualified-provider provision of the Medicaid \nstatute, 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(23)(A), does not fit the mold, \nand it cannot be privately enforced through Section \n1983 suits. \nA. Section 1983 enables private plaintiffs to sue state \nactors for violations of \u201crights\u201d conferred by federal \nlaws.  But federal laws do not ordinarily create Section \n1983-enforceable rights.  Only the rare statutory provi-\nsions that \u201cunambiguously\u201d confer individual rights are \nprivately enforceable under Section 1983\u2014and then, \nonly if there are no countervailing signs that Congress \nsought to rule out Section 1983 suits.  Gonzaga Univ. v. \nDoe, 536 U.S. 273, 283 (2002).  Spending Clause statutes \nface a particularly \u201csignificant hurdle.\u201d Talevski, 599 \nU.S. at 184.  Because the typical remedy for States\u2019 non-\ncompliance with Spending Clause statutory require-\nments is the withholding of federal funding, this Court \nis especially loath to infer that such provisions confer \nprivately enforceable rights.  That \u201cunambiguous con-\nferral\u201d requirement respects federalism interests that \nloom large in Spending Clause legislation, where States \nmust be on clear notice of the conditions they agree to \nshoulder in exchange for federal funds.  Requiring un-\nmistakable evidence that Congress intended to create \nSection 1983-enforceable rights also guards against ju-\ndicial encroachment into Congress\u2019s rights-creating \n\n13 \n \nrole, and prevents private plaintiffs from displacing the \nExecutive as the primary enforcers of Spending Clause \nlaws. \nThis Court\u2019s precedents offer guideposts about what \nfeatures of Spending Clause provisions can clear the \nstringent rights-creating bar.  In Talevski, this Court \nheld that a nursing-home-specific law within the Medi-\ncaid statute conferred Section 1983-enforceable rights \nbecause Congress created a separate statutory section \nfocused on \u201crights,\u201d and repeatedly referred to nursing-\nhome \u201cresidents\u201d and their \u201crights\u201d in the provisions at \nissue.  By contrast, provisions setting out generalized \npolicies with which entities must comply to receive fed-\neral funding do not unambiguously create individual \nrights.  \nB. Applying these precepts, Section 1396a(a)(23) \ndoes not unambiguously confer any rights on individual \nbeneficiaries enforceable via Section 1983.  Whereas the \nnursing-home provisions in Talevski grouped rights-\nconferring provisions together in one place under a \nrights-focused heading, Section 1396a(a) lists 87 provi-\nsions of state-plan requirements without differentia-\ntion.  Whereas the nursing-home provisions set rights-\nrelated provisions apart, Section 1396a(a)(23)\u2019s any-\nqualified-provider provision falls partway through a \nlong list, most of which are not even arguably rights-\nconferring.   \nFurther, whereas the particular nursing-home pro-\nvisions in Talevski repeatedly referred to \u201crights\u201d and \nfocused on specific aspects of patient care, Section \n1396a(a)(23) never mentions \u201crights.\u201d  Although the pro-\nvision briefly mentions \u201cindividual[s],\u201d individual Medi-\ncaid beneficiaries are not its primary focus.  Rather, the \nprovision instructs States on what must be included in \n\n14 \n \ntheir Medicaid plans and directs the Secretary about \nwhat he must find in a state plan to approve it and con-\ntinue federal funding.  States also need to comply only \n\u201csubstantially,\u201d not perfectly, to maintain funding, show-\ning that Section 1396a(a)(23) is more concerned with \nstate decisionmaking in the aggregate.  As Talevski un-\nderscores, Congress knew how to employ Section 1983-\ntriggering language in another part of the Medicaid \nstatute\u2014but tellingly eschewed similar statutory words \nor structure here. \nThe line-drawing, litigation-inviting consequences of \ndeeming Section 1396a(a)(23)\u2019s any-qualified-provider \nprovision to create a privately enforceable individual \nright also militate against doing so.  Scattered through-\nout the list of 87 state-plan requirements are several \nother provisions whose phrasing resembles Section \n1396a(a)(23).  Other Spending Clause statutes use over-\nlapping language.  Finding the any-qualified-provider \nprovision to be privately enforceable would invite pri-\nvate enforcement of those other provisions.  Far from \ntreading carefully before recognizing Section 1983-\ntriggering rights, bringing Section 1396a(a)(23) within \nthe fold could trigger recognition of a dozen or more \nsimilarly worded provisions. \nFurther counseling against finding a privately en-\nforceable right in Section 1396a(a)(23), alternative en-\nforcement mechanisms are available.  The Secretary \ncan of course withhold funding from States, in whole or \nin part.  Federal regulations require a state administra-\ntive hearing process for providers excluded from Medi-\ncaid enrollment.  And the Medicaid statute requires \nStates to provide beneficiaries with an opportunity for \nan administrative hearing in certain circumstances. \n\n15 \n \nII. The court of appeals\u2019 contrary conclusion that \nSection 1396a(a)(23) is privately enforceable under Sec-\ntion 1983 reflects multiple legal errors.  Most signifi-\ncantly, the court parsed fragments of the any-qualified-\nprovider provision\u2014like the phrases \u201cany individual\u201d \nand \u201cmay obtain\u201d\u2014in isolation, but ignored the provi-\nsion as a whole and broader statutory context.  The \ncourt also misread this Court\u2019s decisions and 42 U.S.C. \n1320a-2 as foreclosing all consideration of the provi-\nsion\u2019s place in the statutory scheme.  The court of ap-\npeals thus mistook a commonplace formulation for the \nexceptional case.   \nARGUMENT \nI. THE ANY-QUALIFIED-PROVIDER PROVISION DOES \nNOT CREATE INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS ENFORCEABLE \nUNDER 42 U.S.C. 1983 \nPrivate individuals seeking to enforce Spending \nClause legislation through an action under 42 U.S.C. \n1983 face a demanding bar:  Congress must have unam-\nbiguously conferred individual federal rights in the stat-\nute.  Gonzaga Univ. v. Doe, 536 U.S. 273, 280 (2002).  That \n\u201cstringent standard\u201d will be satisfied only in the \u201catyp-\nical case.\u201d  Health & Hosp. Corp. of Marion County v. \nTalevski, 599 U.S. 166, 183, 186 (2023).  This case is not \natypical.  The Medicaid statute\u2019s any-qualified-provider \nprovision, 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(23)(A), is buried in a long, \nundifferentiated list of requirements for state Medicaid \nplans, and its text lacks \u201cexplicit rights-creating\u201d lan-\nguage.  Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at 284. \n\n16 \n \nA.  Spending Clause Statutes Must Unambiguously Confer \nIndividual Rights To Be Privately Enforceable Under \nSection 1983 \n1. Section 1983 creates a private cause of action \nagainst any person who, under color of state law, de-\nprives another \u201cof any rights, privileges, or immunities \nsecured by the Constitution and laws.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 1983.  \nSection 1983 thus authorizes suits against state actors \nwho violate \u201crights\u201d created by federal laws.  See Maine \nv. Thiboutot, 448 U.S. 1, 4 (1980).  Not every violation of \na federal statute constitutes a deprivation of \u201crights\u201d \nunder Section 1983.  See Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at 283.  In-\nstead, private plaintiffs cannot enforce a federal statute \nunder Section 1983 unless the statute unmistakably \n\u201cconfer[s] individual rights upon a class of beneficiar-\nies.\u201d  Id. at 285.  Even then, Section 1983 enforcement \nmay be unavailable, if Congress signaled expressly or \nimplicitly that it displaced the Section 1983 remedy with \nothers.  See City of Rancho Palos Verdes v. Abrams, \n544 U.S. 113, 120 (2005). \nLegislation enacted under the Spending Clause, U.S. \nConst. Art. I, \u00a7 8, Cl. 1, is particularly unlikely to confer \nenforceable individual rights.  The \u201ctypical remedy for \nstate noncompliance with\u201d conditions imposed in Spend-\ning Clause legislation \u201cis not a private cause of action \nfor noncompliance but rather action by the Federal Gov-\nernment to terminate funds to the State.\u201d  Pennhurst \nState Sch. & Hosp. v. Halderman, 451 U.S. 1, 28 (1981).  \nUnless Congress \u201c\u200a\u2018speak[s] with a clear voice\u2019\u200a\u201d and \n\u201cmanifests an \u2018unambiguous\u2019 intent to confer individual \nrights,\u201d a Spending Clause statute is not privately en-\nforceable under Section 1983.  Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at 280 \n(quoting Pennhurst, 451 U.S. at 17, 28, & n.21) (empha-\nsis added). \n\n17 \n \n2. That rigorous standard harks to similarly strin-\ngent rules in related contexts.  Courts do not interpret \nstatutes to abrogate States\u2019 sovereign immunity unless \nCongress makes \u201cits intention unmistakably clear in the \nlanguage of the statute.\u201d  Dellmuth v. Muth, 491 U.S. \n223, 228 (1989) (citation omitted).  And only \u201cexplicit \n\u2018right- or duty-creating language\u2019\u200a\u201d suffices to show that \nCongress created a private right of action.  Gonzaga, \n536 U.S. at 284 n.3 (citing Alexander v. Sandoval, 532 \nU.S. 275, 288 (2001)).  Those rules are rarely satisfied. \nThe same is true here, not least because reading Spend-\ning Clause legislation to create rights privately enforce-\nable via Section 1983 can raise similar concerns.   \nStart with federalism considerations.  This Court has \nrequired Congress to speak clearly when its legislation \ndisrupts the usual federal-State balance of power.  See \nGregory v. Ashcroft, 501 U.S. 452, 460 (1991).  In Spend-\ning Clause programs like Medicaid, that balance is care-\nfully tailored:  the federal government establishes con-\nditions for funding, but within those parameters, States \ngenerally have latitude to develop their own programs.  \nSee Alexander v. Choate, 469 U.S. 287, 303 (1985).  In-\ndeed, Spending Clause legislation operates \u201cmuch in \nthe nature of a contract.\u201d  Pennhurst, 451 U.S. at 17.  \nThe \u201clegitimacy\u201d of the federal-State bargain \u201crests on \nwhether the State voluntarily and knowingly accepts \nthe terms of the \u2018contract.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Ibid.  A State cannot know-\ningly accept those terms if it \u201cis unaware of the condi-\ntions or is unable to ascertain what is expected of it.\u201d  \nIbid.  Congress is thus expected to \u201cspeak with a clear \nvoice\u201d before imposing a condition on federal funding.  \nIbid.  The same degree of clarity is called for when the \nfunding condition involves a grant of individual rights \n\n18 \n \nthat could expose States to private enforcement suits \nunder Section 1983.   \nRequiring an unambiguous conferral of individual \nrights also alleviates potential \u201cseparation-of-powers \nconcerns.\u201d  Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at 286.  Congress, not the \njudicial branch, has \u201cprimacy\u201d over creating causes of \naction, and courts transgress that line by finding judi-\ncially enforceable rights where Congress leaves some \ndoubt that it intended to create them.  Talevski, 599 U.S. \nat 183.  The rigorous standard of \u201cunambiguous confer-\nral\u201d also safeguards the Executive\u2019s role as the primary \nenforcer of state compliance with federal funding condi-\ntions.  See ibid.  If Congress intends the Executive to \nshare that enforcement with potentially millions of ben-\neficiaries, Congress can be expected to say so clearly. \n3. Earlier decisions of this Court appeared to \u201csug-\ngest that something less than an unambiguously con-\nferred right\u201d could still render Spending Clause provi-\nsions enforceable under Section 1983.  Gonzaga, 536 U.S. \nat 282.  In Wilder v. Virginia Hospital Ass\u2019n, 496 U.S. \n498 (1990), the Court reasoned that Spending Clause \nlegislation could be enforceable under Section 1983 as \nlong as the provision was \u201cintend[ed] to benefit the pu-\ntative plaintiff\u200a\u201d and the plaintiff\u200a\u2019s asserted interest in \nthe statute was not \u201ctoo vague and amorphous\u201d for \ncourts to enforce.  Id. at 509 (citations omitted).  The \nCourt\u2019s analysis in Blessing v. Freestone, 520 U.S. 329 \n(1997), also led some courts to permit private plaintiffs \nto enforce federal statutes under Section 1983 \u201cso long \nas the plaintiff falls within the general zone of interest \nthat the statute is intended to protect.\u201d  Gonzaga, 536 \nU.S. at 283. \nBut in Gonzaga, the Court \u201crepudiate[d] the ready \nimplication of a \u00a7 1983 action that Wilder\u201d and other \n\n19 \n \nearly cases exemplified.  Armstrong v. Exceptional Child \nCenter, Inc., 575 U.S. 320, 330 n.* (2015).  Gonzaga held \nthat nothing \u201cshort of an unambiguously conferred \nright\u201d could \u201csupport a cause of action brought under  \n\u00a7 1983.\u201d  536 U.S. at 283.  Only when the statutory \u201ctext \nand structure\u201d unambiguously contain \u201cexplicit rights-\ncreating\u201d language and an \u201cindividual\u201d focus can federal \nstatutes conceivably create Section 1983-enforceable \nrights.  Id. at 284, 286.  Policy-focused language\u2014like a \nprovision that \u201c[n]o funds shall be made available\u201d to \n\u201cany educational agency or institution which has a pol-\nicy or practice of permitting the release of [students\u2019] \neducation records\u201d without parents\u2019 written consent\u2014\nfails that bar.  Id. at 279 (quoting 20 U.S.C. 1232g(b)(1)). \nEven after Gonzaga was decided in 2002, courts of \nappeals continued to mix statutory analysis of a partic-\nular provision with a more freewheeling inquiry into \nquestions like whether Congress \u201cintended that the \nprovision in question benefit the plaintiff.\u201d  Planned \nParenthood Arizona Inc. v. Betlach, 727 F.3d 960, 966 \n(9th Cir. 2013) (quoting Blessing, 520 U.S. at 341), cert. \ndenied, 571 U.S. 1198 (2014).  This Court in Talevski put \na stop to that approach, instructing that Gonzaga alone \n\u201csets the standard for determining when a Spending \nClause statute confers individual rights.\u201d  599 U.S. at \n193 (Barrett, J., concurring).  Talevski emphasized how \n\u201cstringent\u201d that standard is, and how infrequently it \nwill be met.  Id. at 186 (majority opinion).  Only in the \n\u201catypical case\u201d will Spending Clause legislation clear \nthe \u201csignificant hurdle\u201d of an unambiguous conferral of \nindividual rights.  Id. at 183-184.  Thus, \u201c\u00a7 1983 actions \nare the exception\u2014not the rule\u2014for violations of \nSpending Clause statutes.\u201d  Id. at 193-194 (Barrett, J., \nconcurring).   \n\n20 \n \nB.  The \nAny-Qualified-Provider \nProvision \nDoes \nNot  \nUnambiguously Confer Individual Federal Rights \n1. This Court\u2019s cases illustrate the hallmarks of un-\nusual, rights-conferring provisions versus features that \ndo not suffice.   \nOn one end of the spectrum, Talevski exemplifies the \n\u201catypical case\u201d where Congress clearly and unambigu-\nously created individual-focused rights enforceable un-\nder Section 1983.  599 U.S. at 183.  Again, Talevski in-\nvolved two provisions of a statute governing nursing \nhomes that Congress appended to the federal Medicaid \nstatute.  One required nursing homes to \u201cprotect and pro-\nmote\u201d residents\u2019 \u201cright to be free from\u201d certain \u201cphysi-\ncal or chemical restraints.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 1396r(c)(1)(A)(ii).  \nThe second provided that nursing homes \u201cmust not \ntransfer or discharge [a] resident\u201d unless certain pre-\nconditions were satisfied.  42 U.S.C. 1396r(c)(2)(A) and \n(B).  To parse those provisions, this Court began with \ntheir \u201cplace in the overall statutory scheme.\u201d  Talevski, \n599 U.S. at 184.  Both provisions were housed in a sub-\nsection of the statute titled \u201cRequirements relating to \nresidents\u2019 rights.\u201d  Id. at 184-185 (citations omitted).  Ze-\nroing in on the provisions\u2019 text, the Court observed that \nthey made multiple references to an individual benefi-\nciary (the \u201cresident\u201d), and several express references  \nto \u201crights.\u201d  Ibid.  The Court held that the combined ef-\nfect of the text and structure \u201cinexorably\u201d recognized \nindividual rights enforceable under Section 1983.  Id. at \n192.  Even then, the Court considered whether other \nstatutory features rebutted that unambiguous rights-\ncreating language by suggesting that Congress had \nruled out Section 1983 remedies.  Id. at 186-191.   \nMany other types of provisions fall short.  Consider \nthe provision in Gonzaga:  \u201cNo funds shall be made \n\n21 \n \navailable under any applicable program to any educa-\ntional agency or institution which has a policy or prac-\ntice of permitting the release of [students\u2019] education \nrecords  * * *  without the written consent of their par-\nents.\u201d  20 U.S.C. 1232g(b)(1).  That nondisclosure provi-\nsion includes no \u201c\u200a\u2018rights-creating\u2019 language,\u201d \u201cspeak[s] \nonly to the Secretary of Education,\u201d and concerns only \nwhether entities have a generalized policy that would \ndisqualify them from funding.  Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at \n287-288 (citation omitted).  Further, institutions needed \nto comply only \u201csubstantially\u201d to avoid termination of \nfunding.  Id. at 288.  The absence of any mention of \n\u201crights,\u201d the provision\u2019s focus on the Secretary rather \nthan individuals, and its placement in a substantial-\ncompliance regime all foreclosed Section 1983 enforce-\nment. \nOr take the Medicaid provision in Armstrong, 42 \nU.S.C. 1396a(a)(30)(A), which requires state plans to \n\u201cprovide such methods and procedures\u201d as necessary to \nassure that \u201ccare and services are available under the \nplan at least to the extent * * * available to the general \npopulation in the geographic area.\u201d  In a footnote, Arm-\nstrong explained that the medical-provider plaintiffs \nhad not tried to bring a suit under Section 1983, even \nthough Wilder had found a privately enforceable right \nfor a nearby Medicaid provision requiring state plans to \nprovide \u201cfor payment\u201d of certain services through \u201crea-\nsonable and adequate\u201d reimbursement rates.  575 U.S. \nat 330 n.*; 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(13)(A) (1982).4  The Court \napproved of that strategic decision \u201csince our later opin-\nions plainly repudiate the ready implication of a \u00a7 1983 \naction that Wilder exemplified.\u201d  575 U.S. at 330 n.*.   \n \n4  The provision in Wilder has since been repealed.  See Balanced \nBudget Act of 1997, Pub. L. No. 105-33, \u00a7 4711, 111 Stat. 507-508. \n\n22 \n \n2. Applying those precedents, the any-qualified-\nprovider provision of the Medicaid statute, 42 U.S.C. \n1396a(a)(23)(A) cannot surmount the \u201cdemanding bar\u201d \nfor unmistakably clear, rights-conferring language.  \nTalevski, 599 U.S. at 180.  The statutory \u201ctext and struc-\nture\u201d do not reveal the requisite unambiguous conferral \nof individual rights.  Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at 286.   \n \na. The Court in Talevski began by focusing on the \nFNHRA provisions\u2019 \u201cplace in the overall statutory \nscheme.\u201d  599 U.S. at 184 (citation omitted).  The Court \nobserved that the provisions were set off from the rest \nof the statute in a subsection expressly titled \u201cRequire-\nments relating to residents\u2019 rights.\u201d  Ibid.  (quoting 42 \nU.S.C. 1396r(c)).  That distinctive place in the statute \nwas, at the outset, \u201cindicative of an individual rights-\ncreating focus.\u201d  Ibid. (citation omitted).   \nBeginning in the same place here, the any-qualified-\nprovider provision lacks any special, distinctive place  \nin Section 1396a(a).  The any-qualified-provider provi-\nsion is housed in 42 U.S.C. 1396a, a section titled \u201cState \nplans for medical assistance.\u201d  Subsection (a) of that \nstatute, titled \u201cContents,\u201d includes 87 paragraphs of re-\nquirements for state Medicaid plans, of which the any-\nqualified-provider provision is number 23.  See 42 \nU.S.C. 1396a(a)(1)-(87).  Those paragraphs are not ar-\nranged in any discernible order, let alone under sub-\nheadings that mention \u201crights.\u201d  See 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a).   \nMany of the surrounding 86 paragraphs in 42 U.S.C. \n1396a(a) lack even arguably rights-conferring language.  \nFor example, paragraph (a)(58) requires state plans to \nprovide for the development of a certain \u201cwritten de-\nscription of the law of the State.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \n1396a(a)(58).  And paragraph (a)(6) requires state plans \nto \u201cprovide that the State [Medicaid] agency will make \n\n23 \n \nsuch reports, in such form and containing such infor-\nmation, as the Secretary may from time to time re-\nquire.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(6).  That is simply a report-\ning requirement\u2014a generalized \u201c\u200a\u2018policy or practice\u2019\u200a\u201d of \nthe sort this Court held does not confer individual \nrights.  Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at 288-289.  Section 1396a(a) \nincludes many other similarly generalized policies.5  \nSome were added in the same amendments as the any-\nqualified-provider provision.  See, e.g., Social Security \nAmendments of 1967, Pub. L. No. 90-248, \u00a7\u00a7 227-229, 81 \nStat. 903-905.  Paragraph (a)(24), for example, requires \nstate plans to \u201cprovide for consultative services by \nhealth agencies\u201d to \u201chospitals, nursing homes,\u201d and \nother institutions.  \u00a7 228(a)(3), 81 Stat. 904 (codified as \namended at 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(24)). \nIt is not apparent why Congress would have buried \na rights-conferring provision deep within a long list rid-\ndled with generalized policies.  If Congress intended to \nsingle out the any-qualified-provider provision as the \n\u201catypical case,\u201d one would expect the statutory struc-\nture to reflect that choice, as in Talevski. \nb. Section 1396a(a)(23)\u2019s place in the broader Medi-\ncaid statute reinforces its lack of special, Section 1983-\nenforceable features.  This Court has already observed \nthat provisions in a substantial-compliance regime for \nStates are less likely to trigger Section 1983.  Gonzaga, \n536 U.S. at 288.  A substantial-compliance regime tends \nto indicate a focus on the \u201caggregate practices\u201d of the \n \n5  See, e.g., 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(1) (State plan must \u201cprovide that\u201d \nit \u201cshall be in effect in all political subdivisions of the State\u201d); 42 \nU.S.C. 1396a(a)(59) (State must \u201cmaintain a list\u201d of \u201call physicians \nwho are certified to participate under the State plan\u201d); 42 U.S.C. \n1396a(a)(71) (State plan must \u201cprovide that the State will implement \nan asset verification program\u201d). \n\n24 \n \nfunding recipient, not \u201cwhether the needs of any partic-\nular person have been satisfied.\u201d  Does v. Gillespie, 867 \nF.3d 1034, 1042 (8th Cir. 2017) (citation omitted); Gon-\nzaga, 536 U.S. at 288 (citation omitted).   \nThe Medicaid statute is a case in point:  a State need \nonly \u201ccomply substantially\u201d with Section 1396a(a) re-\nquirements to continue receiving federal funding.  42 \nU.S.C. 1396c(2).  Congress has even authorized the Sec-\nretary to waive entirely States\u2019 compliance with Section \n1396a(a) requirements under certain circumstances.  \nE.g., 42 U.S.C. 1315(a)(1) (authorizing waivers for States \nto conduct pilot projects).  As in Gonzaga, the fact that \nCongress tied federal funding to substantial compliance \nwith Section 1396a(a)(23) and its brethren\u2014and permit-\nted States not to comply at all if the Secretary grants  \na waiver\u2014undercuts the inference that Section \n1396a(a)(23) unambiguously secures individual rights.  \nc. In Talevski, the Court then evaluated the text  \nof the at-issue provisions alongside their place in the \nstatutory scheme.  See 599 U.S. at 185.  There, the re-\ncurrent references to \u201crights\u201d in various levels of  \nsubprovisions\u2014and to \u201cresidents\u201d in the specific provi-\nsions\u2014showed that Congress was unmistakably confer-\nring Section 1983-enforceable rights.  That same ap-\nproach yields the opposite inference here:  Section \n1396a(a)(23)\u2019s text, read in context, does not confer in-\ndividual rights with the requisite clarity. \nFirst, Section 1396a(a)(23) lacks \u201cexplicit rights-\ncreating\u201d language.  Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at 284.  Again, \nthe nursing-home provisions in Talevski were replete \nwith references to \u201crights\u201d:  nursing homes were  \nrequired to protect \u201cthe right to be free from\u201d certain \nrestraints, and the provisions were nestled within sub-\nheadings \nconcerning \n\u201crequirements \nrelating \nto \n\n25 \n \nresidents\u2019 rights\u201d and \u201ctransfer and discharge rights.\u201d  \n599 U.S. at 184-185 (brackets and citations omitted).  \nBut Section 1396a(a)(23)\u2019s any-qualified-provider provi-\nsion never mentions \u201crights,\u201d let alone repeatedly.  \nWhile \u201crights\u201d is not a magic word, the dearth of even \nsynonyms for \u201crights\u201d in Section 1396a(a)(23) makes it \nharder to read the provision to unambiguously confer \nthem.  \nThe closest that Section 1396a(a)(23) comes is the \nphrase \u201cmay obtain\u201d:  state plans must provide that an \neligible individual \u201cmay obtain\u201d care from \u201cany institu-\ntion,\u201d \u201cqualified to perform the service\u201d required, \u201cwho \nundertakes to provide him such services.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \n1396a(a)(23)(A) (emphasis added); see Br. in Opp. 25.  In \nisolation, that phrase could be read as a freestanding \nguarantee that beneficiaries \u201cmay obtain\u201d medical care \nfrom their choice of qualified provider.  But other parts \nof the text undercut that reading. \nSection 1396a(a)(23) lacks an \u201cunmistakable focus on \nthe benefited class.\u201d  Talevski, 599 U.S. at 186 (citation \nomitted).  In Talevski, the nursing-home provisions at \nissue, found in Section 1396r, were not directives to \nStates about what to include in plans or instructions to \nthe Secretary about preconditions State plans had to \nmeet to obtain approval.  Those provisions instead de-\nscribed \u201crights\u201d for individual nursing-home patients \nthroughout.  Here, however, while Section 1396a(a)(23) \nmentions \u201cindividual[s]\u201d who benefit from the federal-\nState bargain to furnish medical care, individual bene-\nficiaries are not the focus in the same way.  Read as a \nwhole, Section 1396a(a)(23) is directed to two other ac-\ntors:  the States and the Secretary.   \nAs to the States, all of Section 1396a(a) instructs \nStates what the required \u201cContents\u201d of their state plans \n\n26 \n \nmust be.  Language in Section 1396a(a)(23) shifts the \nfocus to States further, granting them the authority to \ndecline to provide payments to certain providers \u201ccon-\nvicted of a felony\u201d and to \u201cdetermine[]\u201d which felony \nconvictions should qualify.  See 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(23).   \nMeanwhile, Section 1396a is ultimately directed to \nthe Secretary of HHS, since the provision\u2019s reticulated \nprescriptions for plans tell the Secretary what to look \nfor before approving a State plan.  See 42 U.S.C. \n1396a(b)) (\u201cThe Secretary shall approve any plan which \nfulfills the conditions specified in subsection (a).\u201d); see \nGillespie, 867 F.3d at 1041.  That feature of the statute \nled a plurality of this Court in Armstrong to conclude \nthat a nearby provision, 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(30)(A), \u201cis \nphrased as a directive to the federal agency charged \nwith approving state Medicaid plans, not as a conferral \nof the right to sue upon the beneficiaries.\u201d  575 U.S.  \nat 331 (plurality opinion).  In sum, the any-qualified-\nprovider provision \u201cserve[s] primarily to direct the Fed-\neral Government\u2019s distribution of public funds.\u201d  Talev-\nski, 599 U.S. at 183-184 (brackets and citation omitted). \nCongress could have taken another approach.  As \nTalevski illustrates, even within the Medicaid frame-\nwork, Congress knows how to create individual rights.  \nThe FNHRA is part of the Medicaid statute, and state \nplans must provide for compliance with its provisions  \nto be approved by the Secretary.  See 42 U.S.C. \n1396a(a)(28)(A).  But Congress did not purport to confer \nindividual rights through that state-plan requirement. \nInstead, Congress created a separate, separately subti-\ntled provision focused expressly on rights, see Talevski, \n599 U.S. at 184, and cross-referenced that section in the \nstate-plan requirements for purposes of the Secretary\u2019s \nevaluation of plan compliance.  Had Congress wanted to \n\n27 \n \ncreate similarly enforceable individual rights to choose \nany qualified provider, Congress could have taken the \nsame tack.   \nC. Finding A Privately Enforceable Individual Right In \nThis Case Would Create Line-Drawing Problems \nIf Section 1396a(a)(23) creates privately enforceable \nrights, many analogous provisions sprinkled through-\nout the Medicaid statute and similar federal benefits \nprograms presumptively might as well.  Far from being \n\u201catypical\u201d exceptions, rights-creating provisions could \nswallow the \u201crule,\u201d contravening this Court\u2019s admoni-\ntions in Talevski, 599 U.S. at 183; id. at 193 (Barrett, J., \nconcurring).  Other Spending Clause statutes likewise \ninclude state-plan requirements that refer to \u201cindividu-\nals\u201d and their benefits.  But respondents offer no prin-\ncipled way to draw lines between which of those provi-\nsions confer individual rights and which do not.  That \nrespondents\u2019 theory could potentially make many other \nSpending Clause provisions privately enforceable is an \nadditional reason to reject it, given Talevski\u2019s directive \nthat Section 1983 enforcement of Spending Clause leg-\nislation is meant to be atypical. \nScattered among the generalized state-plan policies \nin Section 1396a are several other provisions that, like \nSection 1396a(a)(23)\u2019s any-qualified-provider provision, \nrefer to \u201cindividual\u201d beneficiaries.  For example, para-\ngraph (a)(12) requires Medicaid plans to \u201cprovide that, \nin determining whether an individual is blind, there \nshall be an examination by a physician skilled in the dis-\neases of the eye or by an optometrist, whichever the in-\ndividual may select.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(12).  Like the \nany-qualified-provider provision, paragraph (a)(12) ref-\nerences an \u201cindividual\u201d and suggests that the plan must \nprovide that he \u201cmay select\u201d the eye specialist of his \n\n28 \n \nchoice.  If the words \u201cindividual\u201d and \u201cmay\u201d suffice to \nunambiguously confer Section 1983-enforceable rights \nin paragraph (a)(23)\u2019s any-qualified-provider provision, \nthen presumably they would unambiguously confer \nrights in paragraph (a)(12), too. \nOther provisions with similar phrasing crop up \namidst Section 1396a(a)\u2019s 87 paragraphs in no discerni-\nble order.  See pp. 22-23, supra.  Take paragraph (a)(3), \nwhich requires state plans to \u201cprovide for granting an \nopportunity for a fair hearing before the State agency \nto any individual whose claim for medical assistance un-\nder the plan is denied or not acted upon with reasonable \npromptness.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(3).  Or paragraph \n(a)(26):  state plans must provide, \u201cwith respect to each \npatient receiving\u201d certain services, for \u201ca written plan \nof care.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(26).  Or consider paragraph \n(a)(53):  state plans are to provide \u201cfor notifying in a \ntimely manner all [eligible] individuals\u201d of \u201cthe availa-\nbility of benefits furnished by the special supplemental \nnutrition program.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(53).   \nOther examples include paragraph (a)(32), which re-\nquires States to provide that \u201cno payment\u201d for care \n\u201cprovided to an individual shall be made to anyone other \nthan such individual,\u201d or paragraph (a)(84), which re-\nquires state plans to provide that they will not termi-\nnate coverage \u201cfor an individual who is an eligible juve-\nnile\u201d because he is \u201can inmate of a public institution.\u201d  \n42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(32); 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(84) (2018); \nsee Pet. Br. 37-40.   \nUnder respondents\u2019 theory, these provisions would \nalso trigger Section 1983.  And the line-drawing difficul-\nties these provisions present under that approach are \nalready apparent.  Lower courts have found some of \nthose provisions to be rights-conferring, but others not \n\n29 \n \nto be.  See, e.g., Shakhnes v. Berlin, 689 F.3d 244, 247 \n(2d Cir. 2012) (finding a privately enforceable right in \nparagraph (a)(3)), cert. denied, 569 U.S. 918 (2013); \nAliser v. SEIU California, 419 F. Supp. 3d 1161, 1168 \n(N.D. Cal. 2019) (holding that paragraph (a)(32) \u201cdoes \nnot create an individually enforceable right\u201d).   \nTreating Section 1396a(a)(23) as a Section 1983- \nenforceable provision would open the door for similar \nprovisions\u2014and the attendant line-drawing problems\u2014\nin other Spending Clause statutes.  The Food and Nu-\ntrition Act of 2008, 7 U.S.C. 2011 et seq., includes a long \nlist of state-plan requirements mentioning individual \n\u201chouseholds,\u201d including that the State shall \u201cpromptly \ndetermine the eligibility of each applicant household\u201d \nfor supplemental nutrition assistance benefits.  7 U.S.C. \n2020(e)(3); see Briggs v. Bremby, 792 F.3d 239 (2d Cir. \n2015) (finding Section 1983-enforceable right).  The fed-\neral adoption-assistance statute requires state plans to, \namong other things, provide for a \u201cfair hearing\u201d to \u201cany \nindividual\u201d whose claim for benefits is denied or not \nacted upon with \u201creasonable promptness.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \n671(a)(12); see ASW v. Oregon, 424 F.3d 970, 978 (9th \nCir. 2005) (finding Section 1983-enforceable right), cert. \ndenied, 549 U.S. 812 (2006).  And other benefits statutes \nrequire state plans to provide that assistance \u201cshall be \nfurnished with reasonable promptness to all eligible in-\ndividuals.\u201d  E.g., 42 U.S.C. 302(a)(8), 1202(a)(11).  Those \nprovisions also mention individual beneficiaries and \nspecific benefits.  Respondents\u2019 theory offers no way to \ndistinguish between these provisions.  And those broad \nconsequences for analogous provisions suggest that \nSection 1396a(a)(23) cannot qualify as the \u201catypical \ncase\u201d of a privately enforceable Spending Clause provi-\nsion.  See Talevski, 599 U.S. at 183.   \n\n30 \n \nD. Other Enforcement Mechanisms Protect Beneficiaries \nJust because Section 1396a(a)(23) is not privately en-\nforceable does not leave beneficiaries without protec-\ntion.  Alternative enforcement mechanisms protect in-\ndividual beneficiaries\u2019 interests, both with respect to \nthe any-qualified-provider provision and other similarly \nworded state-plan provisions.  If anything, those mech-\nanisms cut further against the notion that Congress un-\nmistakably designated Section 1396a(a)(23) as a trigger \nfor Section 1983 suits.  The existence of an alternative \n\u201cmechanism that Congress chose to provide for enforc-\ning\u201d certain provisions \u201cbuttresse[s]\u201d the \u201cconclusion \nthat [those] provisions fail to confer enforceable rights.\u201d  \nGonzaga, 536 U.S. at 289. \nThe primary enforcement mechanism for Spending \nClause legislation is the termination of federal funding.  \nTalevski, 599 U.S. at 183; see 42 U.S.C. 1396c(2).  In ad-\ndition, the Secretary has rejected plan amendments \nthat fail to satisfy the any-qualified-provider provision \nand leave individual beneficiaries with insufficient \nchoice among qualified providers.  See, e.g., Letter from \nThomas A. Scully, Admin., Dep\u2019t of Health & Human \nServs., to Kathryn A. Plant, Dir., N.J. Div. of Med. As-\nsistance & Health Servs. (Sept. 19, 2002). \nThe Secretary has also required States to give pro-\nviders the right to an administrative appeal of their ex-\nclusion from Medicaid.  See 42 C.F.R. 1002.213.  Re-\nspondents contend that it would have been futile for \nPlanned Parenthood to pursue such an appeal given \nthat South Carolina terminated its enrollment pursuant \nto state law.  Br. in Opp. 15 n.2.  But predicted outcomes \nin individual cases do not make the procedure an  \nineffective remedy across the board.  States terminate \nproviders\u2019 participation in Medicaid for different rea-\n\n31 \n \nsons, many of which are well suited to challenge in the \nadministrative appeals process.  The existence of that \nalternative mechanism for challenging the termination \nof a particular provider thus \u201cbuttresse[s]\u201d the conclu-\nsion that Congress did not intend to create a privately \nenforceable right for beneficiaries under Section 1983.  \nGonzaga, 536 U.S. at 289.   \nGiven the availability of alternative remedies, find-\ning a Section 1983-enforceable right in this case \u201cwould \nresult in a curious system\u201d of duplicative enforcement.  \nGillespie, 867 F.3d at 1041; see Pet. Br. 42-43.  Provid-\ners would be able to challenge their disqualification  \nin state administrative proceedings while individuals \nwere challenging the same decision in federal court, po-\ntentially rendering conflicting decisions.  See ibid.  \nSubjecting States to competing litigation might also  \n\u201cdissuade state officials from making decisions that \nthey believe to be in the public interest\u201d when amending \nor implementing their Medicaid plans. Gee v. Planned \nParenthood of Gulf Coast, Inc., 586 U.S. 1057, 1058 \n(2018) (Thomas, J., dissenting from denial of certiorari).   \nFor other state-plan provisions that mention \u201cindi-\nviduals,\u201d see pp. 27-29, supra, additional enforcement \nmechanisms may be available. For example, Section \n1396a(a)(3) requires state plans to provide for fair hear-\nings for individuals whose claims for medical assistance \nare denied.  42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(3).  By federal regula-\ntion, state fair-hearing systems must \u201cmeet the due pro-\ncess standards set forth in Goldberg v. Kelly, 397 U.S. \n254 (1970),\u201d 42 C.F.R. 431.205(d), and provide the op-\nportunity for a hearing when an individual claims that \nthe State has erroneously terminated, suspended, or re-\nduced his Medicaid benefits or eligibility, 42 C.F.R. \n431.201, 431.220.  And as those federal regulations \n\n32 \n \nreflect, the Due Process Clause independently requires \nnotice and a fair hearing before States can deprive indi-\nviduals of particular entitlements.  See Goldberg, 397 \nU.S. 254.  Rejecting respondents\u2019 broad theory of pri-\nvate enforcement here thus would not leave individual \nbeneficiaries without a remedy. \nII. THE COURT OF APPEALS ERRED IN FINDING AN IN-\nDIVIDUAL FEDERAL RIGHT \n \nThe Fourth Circuit\u2019s decision allowing respondents\u2019 \nSection 1983 action misapplied this Court\u2019s cases and \ncontravened this Court\u2019s recent admonitions about the \nrarity of rights-conferring provisions.  The court fo-\ncused on isolated language in the any-qualified-provider \nprovision\u2019s text but failed to properly consider how Sec-\ntion 1396a(a)(23) fits within Section 1396a(a) and the \nMedicaid statute writ large. \n \n1. Courts \u201cmust read the words Congress enacted \n\u2018in their context and with a view to their place in the \noverall statutory scheme.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Turkiye Halk Bankasi A.S. \nv. United States, 598 U.S. 264, 275 (2023) (citation omit-\nted).  Thus, as noted, Talevski first examined the \nbroader statutory scheme governing nursing homes be-\nfore discussing how the at-issue provisions fit within \nthat scheme.  599 U.S. at 184-185. \nHere, however, the court of appeals below focused \nnarrowly on Section 1396a(a)(23)\u2019s references to \u201cany \nindividual\u201d and that eligible individuals \u201cmay obtain\u201d \nmedical assistance from qualified providers.  Pet. App. \n25a.  Even if that language, in isolation, could be read to \nconfer individual rights, additional statutory context \ndispels any inference that Congress unambiguously \nconferred privately enforceable individual rights.  The \nany-qualified-provider provision is simply one of a long \nlist of conditions that the Secretary must find to be \n\n33 \n \nsatisfied before approving state Medicaid plans, and \nthere are other ways of ensuring that Medicaid recipi-\nents have a choice of qualified providers.  See pp. 30-31, \nsupra.   \nBy ignoring the provision\u2019s place in the broader statute, \nthe court of appeals failed to follow Talevski\u2019s mode of \nanalysis and violated the basic rule that \u201cthe words of a \nstatute must be read in their context and with a view to \ntheir place in the overall statutory scheme.\u201d  King v. \nBurwell, 576 U.S. 473, 492 (2015) (citation omitted). \n \n2. The court of appeals discounted broader evidence \nthat Section 1396a(a)(23) does not confer privately en-\nforceable rights based on an erroneous view of this \nCourt\u2019s precedents and a 1994 statute.  See Pet. App. \n27a-31a. \nThe court of appeals downplayed the any-qualified-\nprovider provision\u2019s place in the broader statute be-\ncause the Court in Wilder \u201calready held that a different \nfunding condition enumerated in \u00a7 1396a(a) confers in-\ndividual rights enforceable via 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983.\u201d  See \nPet. App. 27a-28a.  As discussed, Wilder\u2019s reasoning has \nbeen repudiated.  See p. 21, supra.  Wilder supplies a \ncautionary tale, not interpretive instruction. \nThe court of appeals also invoked a separate statu-\ntory provision, 42 U.S.C. 1320a-2, which provides, in rel-\nevant part: \nIn an action brought to enforce a provision of [the \nSocial Security Act], such provision is not to be \ndeemed unenforceable because of its inclusion in a \nsection of this chapter requiring a State plan or spec-\nifying the required contents of a State plan.  This \nsection is not intended to limit or expand the grounds \nfor determining the availability of private actions to \nenforce State plan requirements other than by \n\n34 \n \noverturning any such grounds applied in Suter v. \nArtist M., 112 S. Ct. 1360 (1992), but not applied in \nprior Supreme Court decisions.  \nIbid.  The court of appeals seemed to read Section \n1320a-2 as a directive to consider whether a provision, \nin isolation, \u201cspeak[s] in clear and unambiguous terms,\u201d \nPet. App. 29a, and to place no weight on whether the pro-\nvision is a state-plan requirement.  That was error.  Sec-\ntion 1320a-2 prohibits courts from deeming provisions \nunenforceable under Section 1983 merely because of \ntheir inclusion in a state plan.  See Midwest Foster Care \n& Adoption Ass\u2019n v. Kincade, 712 F.3d 1190, 1200 (8th \nCir. 2013).  It does not require courts to ignore entirely \nthe contextual significance of a provision\u2019s placement in \na list of state-plan requirements. \nFor similar reasons, the court of appeals was wrong \nto dismiss the argument that \u201cthe overlay of a substan-\ntial \ncompliance \nregime \nindicates\u201d \nthat \nSection \n1396a(a)(23) \u201chas an aggregate rather than individual \nfocus.\u201d  Pet. App. 30a.  The court noted that Wilder and \nTalevski both involved provisions within substantial-\ncompliance regimes.  Ibid.  But again, Wilder supplies \nno interpretive guidance.  And Talevski did consider \nbroad features of the Medicaid program, including that \nthe typical remedy for noncompliance with state-plan \nrequirements is to cut off federal funds.  599 U.S. at 181-\n182.  The Court simply found those features outweighed \nby the FNHRA\u2019s recurrent, explicit textual and struc-\ntural focus on individuals and their \u201crights.\u201d  See id. at \n183.  Talevski thus shows that courts should consider \nthe broader statutory context; what courts cannot do is \ntreat placement in a list of state-plan requirements as \nthe beginning and end of the analysis.   \n\n35 \n \n3. In an earlier decision, the court of appeals also \nmisread this Court\u2019s decision in O\u2019Bannon v. Town \nCourt Nursing Center, 447 U.S. 773 (1980).  See Pet. \nApp. 62a-63a.6  The court of appeals stated that to the \nextent O\u2019Bannon is relevant, it \u201csupports the existence \nof a private right,\u201d because of a statement in the deci-\nsion that Section 1396a(a)(23) gives Medicaid recipients \n\u201c\u200a\u2018the right to choose among a range of qualified provid-\ners.\u2019\u200a\u201d Pet. App. 62a-63a (quoting O\u2019Bannon, 447 U.S. at \n787) (emphases added and omitted).   \nThe court of appeals read O\u2019Bannon\u2019s language out \nof context.  O\u2019Bannon was a due-process case, not a Sec-\ntion 1983 right-of-action case.  The Court held that \nPennsylvania did not violate the Due Process Clause by \nterminating a nursing home\u2019s participation in the state \nMedicaid plan without first holding a hearing, because \nSection 1396a(a)(23) does not create a cognizable prop-\nerty interest for Medicaid recipients \u201cto enter an un-\nqualified home and demand a hearing to certify it.\u201d  \nO\u2019Bannon, 447 U.S. at 785.  As an aside, O\u2019Bannon ob-\nserved that Section 1396a(a)(23) purportedly did create \n\u201cthe right to choose among a range of qualified provid-\ners.\u201d  Ibid.  But to the extent O\u2019Bannon was recognizing \nany \u201cright\u201d in that passage, it was a property interest \nsounding in due process, not an unambiguous conferral \nof a Section 1983-enforceable statutory right.   \nMoreover, read in context, O\u2019Bannon\u2019s discussion of \nrights actually cuts against finding a privately enforce-\nable right here.  For purposes of due process, O\u2019Bannon \nheld that Section 1396a(a)(23) \u201cclearly does not confer\u201d \n \n6 The court of appeals discussed O\u2019Bannon in its second decision, \nwhich this Court subsequently vacated in light of Talevski.  See Pet. \nApp. 62a-63a.  The court of appeals then declined to revisit its \u201cpre-\nvious determinations\u201d on remand.  Id. at 12a. \n\n36 \n \nthe very right that respondents assert here:  the right \nto challenge a State\u2019s termination of a particular pro-\nvider as unqualified.  447 U.S. at 785-786.  It would make \nlittle sense to interpret the same provision as \u201cunam-\nbiguously\u201d conferring an individual right to bring such \na challenge via Section 1983. \nCONCLUSION \nThe judgment of the court of appeals should be re-\nversed. \nRespectfully submitted. \n \n \nSARAH M.

          "task_beliefs": "My internal reasoning has not introduced new external facts but has critically refined my model of the case by identifying the next most valuable piece of information. My understanding of the central legal conflict is stable, but my strategy for resolving my remaining uncertainty is now sharply focused.\n\n1.  **Core Legal Question & Controlling Test (Stable and Sharpened):** The case remains centered on whether 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a(a)(23)(A) contains \"unambiguously\" rights-creating language under the *Gonzaga*/*Talevski* standard. The central dispute will be a direct comparison of the language in this statute (\"any individual... may obtain\") to the language upheld in *Talevski*.\n2.  **Petitioner's Argumentative Framework (Stable):** South Carolina's argument is fixed: (1) the statute's focus is on state plans, not individual rights; (2) \u00a7 1983 is a poor fit for enforcing complex Spending Clause conditions; and (3) the exclusive remedy is administrative action by the HHS Secretary.\n3.  **Petitioner's Policy/Narrative Argument (Stable):** The petitioner's case is buttressed by a narrative of state sovereignty, particularly in the post-*Dobbs* context, and the fungibility of Planned Parenthood's funding.\n4.  **Respondent's Position (Stable, derived from BIO):** My understanding of the respondent's strategy, drawn from their Brief in Opposition, remains the most recent significant update.\n    *   **Textual Argument:** The case is anchored in the plain text of \u00a7 1396a(a)(23)(A), arguing the phrase \"any individual... may obtain\" has an \"unmistakable focus on the benefited class\" (the patient), satisfying *Gonzaga*.\n    *   **Precedential Argument:** Respondents will affirmatively use *Talevski*, arguing the Fourth Circuit correctly applied it and that the statutory language is analogous to the rights-creating language upheld in that recent precedent.\n    *   **\"Qualified Provider\" Argument:** \"Qualified\" will be defined as referring to professional/medical competence, framing South Carolina's termination (based on abortion services) as an arbitrary, extra-statutory reason to deny a patient's choice.\n    *   **Rebuttal to Exclusive Remedy:** They will cite a history of lower court decisions finding a private right of action to argue that \u00a7 1983 enforcement is a long-standing, accepted part of the statutory scheme.\n5.  **Inferred Signal: Respondent's Litigation Posture (Stable):** The confident, precedent-heavy BIO confirms the respondents believe the law and recent precedent are on their side.\n6.  **Updated State of Uncertainty (Refined and Focused):** My uncertainty has evolved. It is no longer about the *content* of the core arguments, but about their *reception* by the Court and the influence of key external actors. The `THINK` step has crystallized that the single most informative, unobserved piece of evidence is the position of the United States, as expressed by the Solicitor General. The SG's view on whether a private right of action exists under this federal statute is a highly influential signal for the Court. The EIG of finding the SG's brief is now maximal.\n7.  **Administrative Details (Stable):** The identities of counsel (Bursch for petitioner, Saharsky for respondent) and the party substitution remain low-value administrative facts.",
          "design_beliefs": "This reflective step was highly productive, validating several core meta-cognitive heuristics and generating a new, high-value heuristic for analyzing cases involving federal statutes.\n\n1.  **\"Petitioner-First\" Heuristic:** A robust starting point.\n2.  **\"The *Talevski* Litmus Test\" (Refined):** The primary battleground. Analysis must focus on the direct comparison between the statutory language in *Talevski* and \u00a7 1396a(a)(23)(A).\n3.  **\"Precedent Bracketing\":** A confirmed strategy.\n4.  **Refined Source Prioritization (Updated):** The hierarchy is now: (1) Merits Briefs, (2) Brief in Opposition, (3) Cert Petition, (4) Amicus Briefs. The BIO is an exceptionally valuable source, providing a high-fidelity blueprint for the merits.\n5.  **\"The Meta-Cognitive Loop\" (Strongly Validated):** This observation is a direct and successful application of this heuristic: I assessed my current knowledge state, identified key uncertainties (merits briefs, amicus, SG), and prioritized the next action based on a conscious evaluation of Expected Information Gain.\n6.  **\"BIO as Merits Blueprint\":** The BIO is a blueprint for the merits argument, especially when filed after a key intervening precedent like *Talevski*.\n7.  **\"Action Query and Result Scrutiny\":** An established lesson.\n8.  **\"Amicus Briefs as Signals\" (Refined):** Amicus briefs signal the direction and intensity of arguments. However, not all amici are equal. This leads to a new, more specific heuristic.\n9.  **NEW Heuristic: \"Prioritize the SG's View in Federal Statutory Cases.\"** In cases concerning the interpretation of a federal statute and the existence of a private right of action to enforce it, the view of the United States Solicitor General is a uniquely powerful signal. The SG's brief often carries significant weight with the Court and must be prioritized as a top-tier source of information, potentially rivaling the value of the primary merits briefs for predictive purposes.\n10. **\"Cert-Stage vs. Merits-Stage\":** A failed search for a merits-stage document that returns a high-value cert-stage document is a partial success.\n11. **\"Conscious EIG Targeting\" (Strongly Validated):** The internal monologue explicitly used EIG as the criterion for selecting the next action (seeking the SG's brief), demonstrating the value of consciously reasoning about which information will most effectively reduce uncertainty for both the task (\u03b8) and design (D) models.\n12. **\"Iterative Query Refinement\":** A confirmed, valuable process.\n13. **\"Multi-Pronged Search Strategy\":** Confirmed.\n14. **\"Amicus Argument Stratification\":** Amicus briefs must be weighed differently.\n15. **\"Search by Named Entity\":** A strongly validated heuristic.\n16. **\"Procedural Documents as Behavioral Signals\":** Confirmed.\n17. **\"Refine Search by Document Type/Title\":** A strongly validated heuristic.\n18. **\"Argumentative Framing is Key\":** The case may turn on which frame the Court finds more persuasive: the respondent's \"individual statutory right\" frame or the petitioner's \"federalism and judicial power\" frame.\n19. **\"Table of Authorities as a Map\":** A document's Table of Authorities is a structured data source for mapping a party's view of the legal landscape."

My model of the case has shifted from identifying the core conflict to analyzing the overwhelming weight of a key player's argument.\n\n1.  **Core Legal Question & Controlling Test (Stable, with a Dominant Interpretation):** The case remains centered on whether 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a(a)(23)(A) has \"unambiguously\" rights-creating language under the *Gonzaga*/*Talevski* standard. However, the Solicitor General (SG) has now provided a powerful, detailed, and highly influential argument that it does **not**. The SG's interpretation, which emphasizes statutory structure and the high bar set by *Talevski*, now serves as the dominant analytical framework for predicting the Court's majority opinion.\n2.  **Petitioner's Argumentative Framework (Stable and Strongly Reinforced):** The Petitioner's arguments are no longer just inferred; they are now explicitly and powerfully articulated by the United States government. The SG's brief validates and amplifies South Carolina's position that: (1) the provision is merely one of 87 administrative requirements for state plans, not a special rights-creating section; (2) it lacks the explicit \"rights\" language found in *Talevski*; and (3) the proper remedy for non-compliance is administrative action by the HHS Secretary, not private lawsuits under \u00a7 1983.\n3.  **Petitioner's Policy/Narrative Argument (Stable):** This narrative remains a backdrop, but the SG's brief provides a much stronger, text-and-structure-based legal foundation for the Petitioner's position.\n4.  **Respondent's Position (Stable, but Significantly Weakened):** My understanding of the Respondent's strategy (derived from the BIO) is stable, but its likely effectiveness has been severely undermined.\n    *   **Textual Argument:** The SG directly counters the \"unmistakable focus on the benefited class\" argument by framing the provision's language as \"garden-variety Spending Clause language\" and emphasizing its placement within a long, undifferentiated list of administrative requirements.\n    *   **Precedential Argument:** The Respondent's plan to affirmatively use *Talevski* is now extremely challenging. The SG argues that *Talevski* actually *clarifies* why this provision is *not* rights-creating, effectively turning the Respondent's key precedent against them.\n    *   **Rebuttal to Exclusive Remedy:** The SG's focus on HHS enforcement as the \"typical remedy\" directly supports the Petitioner's argument on this front.\n5.  **NEW and CRITICAL Signal: The U.S. Government's Position:** The United States, as amicus curiae, is **supporting the Petitioner, South Carolina**. This is a major development. The SG argues that \u00a7 1396a(a)(23) is a \"non-actionable rule\" and finding a private right of action would \"invite private enforcement of numerous Spending Clause statutes.\" The influence of the SG's office on the Court, particularly in matters of federal statutory interpretation, cannot be overstated.\n6.  **NEW Signal: The Government's Change in Position:** The SG's brief explicitly acknowledges that the United States has changed its position, having previously argued in lower courts and in a footnote in its *Talevski* brief that this provision *did* create an enforceable right. The SG attributes this change to \"the change in Administration and in light of *Talevski*.\" This is a crucial fact that highlights the legal significance of the *Talevski* decision and will likely be a focus of questioning at oral argument.\n7.  **Updated State of Uncertainty (Dramatically Reduced):** My primary uncertainty\u2014the position of the Solicitor General\u2014is now resolved. This observation significantly shifts my prediction toward a victory for the Petitioner. My confidence in this outcome is now high. The remaining uncertainty revolves around how the Court's liberal wing will contend with the SG's new position and the long history of lower courts finding a private right of action, but the path for a majority opinion siding with the Petitioner is now exceptionally clear.\n8.  **Administrative Details (Stable):** The identities of counsel and party substitutions remain stable. The SG's counsel of record is now identified as Sarah M. Harris.",
          "design_beliefs": "This observation has been profoundly validating for my evolving methodology, confirming the high value of certain heuristics and generating new, more nuanced principles for legal analysis.\n\n1.  **\"Petitioner-First\" Heuristic:** A robust starting point.\n2.  **\"The *Talevski* Litmus Test\" (Refined):** This remains the central test. The SG's brief demonstrates that a critical part of applying this test is **structural analysis**. The placement of a provision (e.g., in a long list vs. a dedicated \"rights\" section) and the absence of explicit \"rights\" terminology can outweigh language that merely focuses on a beneficiary.\n3.  **\"Precedent Bracketing\":** A confirmed strategy.\n4.  **Refined Source Prioritization (Updated and Confirmed):** The hierarchy is confirmed and sharpened. The SG's amicus brief in a federal statutory case is a Tier-1 source, equal to or in some cases more predictively valuable than the primary merits briefs. The BIO remains a high-value blueprint of a party's argument, but the SG brief can provide a powerful counter-blueprint.\n5.  **\"The Meta-Cognitive Loop\" & \"Conscious EIG Targeting\" (Strongly Validated):** My explicit reasoning that the SG's brief had the highest Expected Information Gain was proven correct. This success strongly reinforces the practice of consciously identifying key uncertainties and prioritizing actions that directly resolve them.\n6.  **\"BIO as Merits Blueprint\":** This holds, but the SG brief demonstrates how the strategic landscape can be reshaped between the cert and merits stages, especially by intervening precedents or influential amici.\n7.  **NEW Heuristic: \"Track Changes in Position.\"** When a major litigant, especially the U.S. Government, formally changes its legal interpretation of a statute, it is a critical signal. The reasons cited for the change (here, a new precedent and a new administration) provide deep insight into the legal and political dynamics of the case.\n8.  **NEW Heuristic: \"Structural Arguments Can Trump Beneficiary-Focus Arguments.\"** In the post-*Talevski* context for Spending Clause cases, the SG's approach suggests that arguments based on a statute's overall structure, headings, and placement of provisions are now considered a more powerful indicator of congressional intent to create a private right than simply identifying language that focuses on a benefited class.\n9.  **\"Amicus Briefs as Signals\" (Refined):** This heuristic is now stratified. The SG's amicus brief is not just a signal; it is a primary analytical document that can frame the entire debate. It must be treated as a class apart from other amicus filings.\n10. **\"Prioritize the SG's View in Federal Statutory Cases\" (STRONGLY VALIDATED):** This heuristic, developed in the last step, has been proven to be of paramount importance. The SG's brief did not just offer an opinion; it provided a comprehensive, well-reasoned legal framework that is likely to be highly persuasive to the Court.\n11. **\"Argumentative Framing is Key\" (Strongly Validated):** The SG's brief is a masterclass in framing. Describing the provision's language as \"garden-variety\" and a \"non-actionable rule\" versus a \"rights-creating rara avis\" (rare bird) is powerful rhetoric that shapes the terms of the debate.\n12. **\"Table of Authorities as a Map\":** Confirmed. The SG's Table of Authorities shows a heavy reliance on *Gonzaga* and *Talevski*, confirming they are the central pillars of the modern test for \u00a7 1983 rights."

The petition for a writ of certiorari \nwas filed on June 3, 2024.  The jurisdiction of this \nCourt is invoked under 28 U.S.C. 1254(1).  \n\n2 \n \n \n \nSTATEMENT \nPlanned Parenthood South Atlantic (PPSAT) \nprovides essential medical services, including birth \ncontrol, cancer screenings, and physical exams, to low-\nincome South Carolina residents through the state\u2019s \nMedicaid program.  South Carolina terminated \nPPSAT\u2019s participation in that program, even though \nit \u201cagree[s]\u201d that PPSAT \u201cis perfectly competent to \nprovide  *  *  *  healthcare.\u201d  Pet. App. 41a.  PPSAT \nand one of its patients, who relies on PPSAT for care \nthat is critical for preserving her health, sued under \n42 U.S.C. 1983.  They contended that the termination \nviolates the Medicaid Act\u2019s free-choice-of-provider \nprovision, 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(23)(A), which gives \nMedicaid recipients the right to choose to receive their \nmedical care from any qualified and willing provider.  \nPet. App. 6a, 8a.   \nThe district court preliminarily enjoined the \ndirector of the state health department (petitioner) \nfrom terminating PPSAT\u2019s participation in the \nMedicaid program, Pet. App. 126a-146a; the court of \nappeals affirmed, id. at 80a-119a; and this Court \ndenied certiorari, see id. at 47a. \nThe \ndistrict \ncourt \nthen \ngranted \nsummary \njudgment to PPSAT and the patient, id. at 66a-79a; \nthe court of appeals affirmed, id. at 64a; and this \nCourt granted the petition, vacated, and remanded in \nlight of Health & Hospital Corp. of Marion County v. \nTalevski, 599 U.S. 166 (2023), Pet. App. 37a.  After \nreconsidering its prior holding in light of Talevski, the \ncourt of appeals again affirmed, with all three judges \nagreeing that the Medicaid Act\u2019s free-choice-of-\nprovider provision is privately enforceable under \nSection 1983.  Id. at 1a-35a; id. at 36a (Richardson, J., \nconcurring in the judgment).   \n\n3 \n \n \n \n1. Medicaid is the national health insurance \nprogram for persons of limited financial means.  Pet. \nApp. 5a.  It provides federal funding for medical care \nfor children, needy families, the elderly, the blind, the \ndisabled, and pregnant women.  See 42 U.S.C. \n1396d(a).   \nMedicaid is a joint federal-state effort.  Pet. App. \n5a.  A state must comply with various federal \nrequirements to participate, see Armstrong v. \nExceptional Child Ctr., Inc., 575 U.S. 320, 323 (2015), \nincluding the free-choice-of-provider requirement.  To \ncomply with that requirement, a state\u2019s Medicaid plan \n\u201cmust\u201d provide that \u201cany individual eligible for \nmedical assistance  *  *  *  may obtain such assistance\u201d \nfrom any provider who is \u201cqualified to perform the \nservice or services required\u201d and \u201cwho undertakes to \nprovide \nhim \nsuch \nservices.\u201d \n \n42 \nU.S.C. \n1396a(a)(23)(A).   \n2. PPSAT and its predecessors have provided \nhealth care to low-income residents of South Carolina \nfor four decades.  Pet. App. 7a, 58a.  PPSAT operates \ntwo health centers in the state, one in Charleston and \none in Columbia.  Id. at 6a.  Both are in medically \nunderserved communities.  See Resp. C.A. Br. 4, No. \n21-1043 (4th Cir. May 28, 2021) (21-1043 Resp. C.A. \nBr.).  Those centers serve hundreds of Medicaid \npatients each year.  Pet. App. 7a, 87a. \nPPSAT\u2019s health centers provide essential medical \ncare through Medicaid.  They offer a range of services, \nincluding \nphysical \nexams; \ncancer \nscreenings; \ncontraception; pregnancy testing and counseling; and \nscreening for conditions such as diabetes, depression, \nanemia, cholesterol, thyroid disorders, and high blood \npressure.  Pet. App. 6a, 69a; 21-1043 Resp. C.A. Br. 4.  \nThe health centers provide abortion services, but \nMedicaid does not pay for abortion except in the very \n\n4 \n \n \n \nlimited circumstances required by federal law.  Pet. \nApp. 6a-7a. \nPatients insured through Medicaid choose PPSAT \nfor many reasons.  PPSAT provides non-judgmental, \nhigh-quality medical care.  See Pet. App. 6a-7a.  It also \nhas designed its services to help low-income patients \novercome barriers to accessing care.  Id. at 7a.  For \nexample, PPSAT offers extended hours and flexible \nscheduling; same-day appointments and short wait \ntimes; comprehensive contraceptive care in a single \nappointment; and interpreter services for patients \nwho do not speak English.  Ibid.  PPSAT continued to \noffer high-quality medical care during the COVID-19 \npandemic, including through telemedicine.  21-1043 \nResp. C.A. Br. 5.  That ensured continuity of care for \nlow-income patients and lessened the burdens on \nother parts of the health care system.  Pet. App. 7a-8a \n& n.2.   \nRespondent Julie Edwards is a Medicaid patient \nwho has received care at PPSAT.  Pet. App. 7a.  She \nsuffers from diabetes.  Id. at 44a.  Because doctors \nhave advised her that complications from diabetes \nwould make it dangerous for her to carry a pregnancy \nto term, she sought access to safe and effective birth \ncontrol.  Ibid.  After having difficulty finding a doctor \nwho would treat her, she obtained care at PPSAT.  Id. \nat 7a, 44a.  PPSAT doctors provided her with birth \ncontrol and also informed her that her blood pressure \nwas elevated, so she could obtain follow-up care for \nthat issue.  Ibid.  Ms. Edwards was impressed with \nPPSAT and intends to obtain future gynecological and \nreproductive health care there.  Ibid.   \n3. In July 2018, South Carolina\u2019s Department of \nHealth and Human Services (SCDHHS) terminated \nPPSAT\u2019s participation in the state Medicaid program.  \nPet. App. 8a, 70a.  The termination was prompted by \n\n5 \n \n \n \nthe Governor, who issued two executive orders \ndesigned to withdraw state funding from any \norganization that provides abortions, purportedly \nbased on a twenty-five-year-old statute.  Id. at 8a, 88a; \nsee S.C. Code Ann. \u00a7 43-5-1185. \nRelying on those orders, SCDHHS terminated \nPPSAT\u2019s state Medicaid agreement.  Pet. App. 8a.  \nSCDHHS did not find that PPSAT is unqualified to \nprovide care.  Id. at 87a.  Instead, it terminated \nPPSAT\u2019s participation in Medicaid \u201csolely because \n[PPSAT] performed abortions outside of the Medicaid \nprogram.\u201d  Ibid.  As a result of the termination, \nPPSAT\u2019s health centers immediately had to begin \nturning away Medicaid patients.  Id. at 88a. \n4. Respondents sued under 42 U.S.C. 1983.  Pet. \nApp. 8a.  They alleged, inter alia, that the termination \nviolates the Medicaid Act\u2019s free-choice-of-provider \nprovision.  Ibid.  They sought preliminary injunctive \nrelief, so that Ms. Edwards and other patients could \ncontinue to receive care from their chosen providers.  \nIbid. \nThe \ndistrict \ncourt \nentered \na \npreliminary \ninjunction.  Pet. App. 126a-146a.  As a threshold \nmatter, it held that the Medicaid Act\u2019s free-choice-of-\nprovider requirement is privately enforceable under \nSection 1983 because the statute \u201cunambiguously \nconfers a right\u201d on Medicaid patients to \u201cobtain \nassistance from any qualified and willing provider.\u201d  \nId. at 134a.  Then, on the merits, the court concluded \nthat petitioner likely violated the Medicaid Act by \nterminating PPSAT\u2019s Medicaid participation without \ncause.  Id. at 138a-141a.  The court found it \n\u201cundisputed\u201d that PPSAT is \u201cqualified\u201d to provide \nmedical care, as the statute requires.  Id. at 138a-139a \n(citing 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(23)(A)).   \n\n6 \n \n \n \nThe court of appeals affirmed the preliminary \ninjunction.  Pet. App. 80a-125a.  Like the district \ncourt, the court of appeals concluded that a Medicaid \npatient may sue under Section 1983 to enforce the \nfree-choice-of-provider requirement.  Id. at 94a-98a.  \nApplying this Court\u2019s decisions in Blessing v. \nFreestone, 520 U.S. 329 (1997), and Gonzaga \nUniversity v. Doe, 536 U.S. 273 (2002), the court of \nappeals recognized that a federal statute creates a \nright enforceable under Section 1983 \u201conly when the \nunderlying statute itself unambiguously \u2018confers an \nindividual right\u2019 on the plaintiff.\u201d  Pet. App. 94a \n(quoting Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at 284-285).   \nHere, the court of appeals explained, the statute is \n\u201cunmistakably \nclear\u201d \nin \ncreating \na \nprivately \nenforceable right.  Pet. App. 103a-104a.  \u201cIf th[is] \nlanguage does not suffice to confer a private right, \nenforceable under \u00a7 1983,\u201d the court stated, \u201cit is \ndifficult to see what language would be adequate.\u201d  Id. \nat 102a.  All three judges agreed on this point.  See \nibid.; id. at 120a-125a (Richardson, J., concurring) \n(agreeing that the statute \u201cunambiguously create[s] a \nright privately enforceable under \u00a7 1983\u201d).    \nOn the merits, the court of appeals concluded that \nPPSAT and Ms. Edwards established a likelihood of \nsuccess on the merits because under the free-choice-\nof-provider provision, a state may not exclude a \nqualified and willing provider.  Pet. App. 138a-141a.  \nThe court noted that petitioner did not dispute that \n\u201cPPSAT is professionally qualified to deliver the \nservices that [Ms. Edwards] seeks.\u201d  Id. at 107a; see \nid. at 98a n.3 (\u201cPPSAT\u2019s qualifications are simply not \nin dispute\u201d in this case.).  The court rejected \npetitioner\u2019s argument that it can terminate the \nMedicaid contract of any provider it wishes even when \n\n7 \n \n \n \nit \u201cadmits\u201d that the provider is \u201cperfectly competent.\u201d  \nId. at 109a-110a.   \nPetitioner filed a petition for a writ of certiorari, \nwhich this Court denied.  Baker v. Planned \nParenthood S. Atl., 141 S. Ct. 550 (2020) (No. 19-\n1186). \n5. The district court granted summary judgment \nto PPSAT and Ms. Edwards and entered a permanent \ninjunction.  Pet App. 68a-79a.  The court again held \nthat \nthe \nMedicaid \nAct\u2019s \nfree-choice-of-provider \nprovision is privately enforceable under Section 1983 \nand determined that petitioner violated the Medicaid \nAct by terminating PPSAT\u2019s participation in the state \nMedicaid program.  Id. at 74a.  The court noted that \npetitioner did not dispute that PPSAT is a \u201cmedically \nand professionally qualified provider\u201d and determined \nthat petitioner accordingly had no valid basis for the \ntermination.  Ibid. \nThe court of appeals affirmed.  Pet. App. 38a-64a.  \nThe court again held that Medicaid\u2019s free-choice-of-\nprovider provision confers a right enforceable under \nSection 1983.  Id. at 54a-64a.  The court carefully \nreviewed this Court\u2019s precedents and recognized that \n\u201cnothing \u2018short of an unambiguously conferred right\u2019  \n*  *  *  may support a cause of action.\u201d  Id. at 55a \n(quoting Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at 283).  The statute here, \nthe \ncourt \nexplained, \n\u201cunmistakably \nevinces \nCongress\u2019s \nintention \nto \nconfer \non \nMedicaid \nbeneficiaries a right to the free choice of their \nprovider\u201d because it confers an individual right in \nmandatory terms; courts are competent to determine \nif a provider is qualified; and the Medicaid Act does \nnot provide a comprehensive enforcement scheme that \nshows \nCongress\u2019s \nintent \nto \nforeclose \nprivate \nenforcement.  Id. at 57a-62a.  Again, all three judges \nagreed that the statute unambiguously confers a \n\n8 \n \n \n \nprivate right enforceable under Section 1983.  Id. at \n51a-64a; id. at 65a (Richardson, J., concurring in the \njudgment).  \nThe court of appeals noted that petitioner no \nlonger contested the merits.  Pet. App. 51a.  \nSpecifically, petitioner \u201cd[id] not\u201d renew his merits \narguments \nto \n\u201cchallenge \nthe \ndistrict \ncourt\u2019s \ndetermination (and [the court of appeals\u2019] own \nprevious conclusion) that South Carolina violated\u201d the \nfree-choice-of-provider provision \u201cby terminating \nPlanned Parenthood\u2019s Medicaid provider agreement.\u201d  \nId. at 51a n.1.  \n6. This Court then granted the petition for a writ \nof certiorari in Talevski.  That petition presented two \nquestions:  (1) whether a federal statute that Congress \nenacted using its Spending Clause power can give rise \nto a right enforceable under Section 1983, and \n(2) whether two provisions in the Federal Nursing \nHome \nReform \nAct \n(FNHRA), \n42 \nU.S.C. \n1396r(c)(1)(A)(ii) and 1396r(c)(2)(A), are privately \nenforceable under Section 1983.  See Pet. at *i-ii, \nHealth & Hosp. Corp. of Marion Cnty. v. Talevski, No. \n21-806, 2021 WL 5702312 (Nov. 23, 2021).  The Court \nanswered both questions in the affirmative.  Talevski, \n599 U.S. at 175-191.  In concluding that the provisions \nat issue are privately enforceable under Section 1983, \nthe Court applied its \u201cestablished method for \nascertaining unambiguous conferral\u201d of an individual \nright.  Id. at 183; see id. at 175-191.  \nIn the meantime, petitioner filed a petition for a \nwrit of certiorari in this case.  The Court granted the \npetition, vacated the judgment of the court of appeals, \nand remanded the case for further consideration in \nlight of Talevski.  Kerr v. Planned Parenthood S. Atl., \n143 S. Ct. 2633 (2023) (No. 21-1431). \n\n9 \n \n \n \n7. The court of appeals affirmed.  Pet. App. 1a-\n36a.  \u201c[W]ith the benefit of Talevski\u2019s guidance,\u201d the \ncourt again held that the free-choice-of-provider \nprovision \nconfers \na \nright \nenforceable \nunder \nSection 1983.  Id. at 12a-13a. \nThe court of appeals explained that the free-choice-\nof-provider provision is enforceable under Section \n1983 \nbecause \nit \n\u201cexplicitly \ngives \nMedicaid \nbeneficiaries the right to the provider of their choice\u201d \nand \u201cthere is no indication that Congress wanted to \nforeclose such individuals from seeking relief under \n\u00a7 1983.\u201d  Pet. App. 14a.  On the first point, the court \nreviewed this Court\u2019s precedents and recognized that \n\u201c\u200a\u2018Gonzaga sets forth [the] established method for \nascertaining unambiguous conferral\u2019 of individual \nrights.\u201d  Id. at 19a (quoting Talevski, 599 U.S. at 183).  \nThat test is satisfied, the court continued, \u201cwhere the \nprovision in question is \u2018phrased in terms of the \npersons benefited\u2019 and contains \u2018rights-creating,\u2019 \nindividual-centric language with an \u2018unmistakable \nfocus on the benefited class.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Ibid. (quoting Talevski, \n599 U.S. at 183 (in turn quoting Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at \n284, 287)).   \nHere, the court of appeals explained, the free-\nchoice-of-provider provision unambiguously confers \nrights on individual Medicaid recipients:  \u201cLike the \ntext at issue in Talevski,\u201d the free-choice-of-provider \nprovision \u201cspeak[s] \u2018in terms of the person benefited,\u2019 \nand ha[s] an \u2018unmistakable focus on the benefited \nclass.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Pet. App. 25a (quoting Talevski, 599 U.S. at \n186).  The free-choice-of-provider provision, the court \nexplained, \u201cfocus[es] on discrete beneficiaries and \nguarantee[s] them a choice\u201d of any qualified medical \nprovider \u201cfree from state interference.\u201d  Ibid.  The \ncourt noted that Talevski \u201cbolstered [its] previous \nconclusion\u201d by providing examples of rights-creating \n\n10 \n \n \n \nlanguage \u201csimilar to the language\u201d in the free-choice-\nof-provider provision.  Ibid.   \nPetitioner had argued that the court of appeals \nshould reverse its prior holdings because its decisions \ncited Blessing and Wilder v. Virginia Hospital Ass\u2019n, \n496 U.S. 498 (1990), and in petitioner\u2019s view, those \ndecisions no longer are good law after Talevski.  Pet. \nApp. 14a.

South Carolina terminated the \nMedicaid \nprovider \nagreement \nof \na \nPlanned \nParenthood affiliate without cause.  The affiliate and \none of its patients sued under 42 U.S.C. 1983.  The \npatient invoked the Medicaid Act\u2019s free-choice-of-\nprovider provision, which states that \u201cany individual \neligible for medical assistance\u201d \u201cmay obtain such \nassistance from any institution\u201d that is \u201cqualified to \nperform the service or services required\u201d and \n\u201cundertakes to provide [the individual] such services.\u201d  \n42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(23)(A).   \nThree times, the court of appeals has held that the \nfree-choice-of-provider \nprovision \nunambiguously \nconfers a right that is privately enforceable under \nSection 1983.  In its most recent decision, the court of \nappeals so held after faithfully applying this Court\u2019s \nrecent decision in Health & Hospital Corp. of Marion \nCounty v.

KERR, DIRECTOR, SOUTH CAROLINA  \nDEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, \nPETITIONER\nv. \nPLANNED PARENTHOOD SOUTH ATLANTIC, ET AL. \nOn Petition for a Writ of Certiorari to the  \nUnited States Court of Appeals  \nfor the Fourth Circuit \nBRIEF IN OPPOSITION\nOPINIONS BELOW \nThe opinion of the court of appeals (Pet. App. 1a-\n36a) is reported at 95 F.4th 152.  The opinion of the \ndistrict court (Pet. App. 68a-79a) is reported at 487 F. \nSupp. 3d 443.   \nPrior relevant opinions of the court of appeals (Pet. \nApp. 38a-65a, 80a-125a) are reported at 27 F.4th 945 \nand 941 F.3d 687.  A prior relevant order of the district \ncourt (Pet. App. 126a-146a) is reported at 326 F. Supp. \n3d 39.  \nJURISDICTION \nThe judgment of the court of appeals was entered \non March 5, 2024.  The petition for a writ of certiorari \nwas filed on June 3, 2024.  The jurisdiction of this \nCourt is invoked under 28 U.S.C. 1254(1).  \n\n2 \n \n \n \nSTATEMENT \nPlanned Parenthood South Atlantic (PPSAT) \nprovides essential medical services, including birth \ncontrol, cancer screenings, and physical exams, to low-\nincome South Carolina residents through the state\u2019s \nMedicaid program.  South Carolina terminated \nPPSAT\u2019s participation in that program, even though \nit \u201cagree[s]\u201d that PPSAT \u201cis perfectly competent to \nprovide  *  *  *  healthcare.\u201d  Pet. App. 41a.  PPSAT \nand one of its patients, who relies on PPSAT for care \nthat is critical for preserving her health, sued under \n42 U.S.C. 1983.  They contended that the termination \nviolates the Medicaid Act\u2019s free-choice-of-provider \nprovision, 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(23)(A), which gives \nMedicaid recipients the right to choose to receive their \nmedical care from any qualified and willing provider.  \nPet. App. 6a, 8a.   \nThe district court preliminarily enjoined the \ndirector of the state health department (petitioner) \nfrom terminating PPSAT\u2019s participation in the \nMedicaid program, Pet. App. 126a-146a; the court of \nappeals affirmed, id. at 80a-119a; and this Court \ndenied certiorari, see id. at 47a. \nThe \ndistrict \ncourt \nthen \ngranted \nsummary \njudgment to PPSAT and the patient, id. at 66a-79a; \nthe court of appeals affirmed, id. at 64a; and this \nCourt granted the petition, vacated, and remanded in \nlight of Health & Hospital Corp. of Marion County v. \nTalevski, 599 U.S. 166 (2023), Pet. App. 37a.  After \nreconsidering its prior holding in light of Talevski, the \ncourt of appeals again affirmed, with all three judges \nagreeing that the Medicaid Act\u2019s free-choice-of-\nprovider provision is privately enforceable under \nSection 1983.  Id. at 1a-35a; id. at 36a (Richardson, J., \nconcurring in the judgment).   \n\n3 \n \n \n \n1. Medicaid is the national health insurance \nprogram for persons of limited financial means.  Pet. \nApp. 5a.  It provides federal funding for medical care \nfor children, needy families, the elderly, the blind, the \ndisabled, and pregnant women.  See 42 U.S.C. \n1396d(a).   \nMedicaid is a joint federal-state effort.  Pet. App. \n5a.  A state must comply with various federal \nrequirements to participate, see Armstrong v. \nExceptional Child Ctr., Inc., 575 U.S. 320, 323 (2015), \nincluding the free-choice-of-provider requirement.  To \ncomply with that requirement, a state\u2019s Medicaid plan \n\u201cmust\u201d provide that \u201cany individual eligible for \nmedical assistance  *  *  *  may obtain such assistance\u201d \nfrom any provider who is \u201cqualified to perform the \nservice or services required\u201d and \u201cwho undertakes to \nprovide \nhim \nsuch \nservices.\u201d \n \n42 \nU.S.C. \n1396a(a)(23)(A).   \n2. PPSAT and its predecessors have provided \nhealth care to low-income residents of South Carolina \nfor four decades.  Pet. App. 7a, 58a.  PPSAT operates \ntwo health centers in the state, one in Charleston and \none in Columbia.  Id. at 6a.  Both are in medically \nunderserved communities.  See Resp. C.A. Br. 4, No. \n21-1043 (4th Cir. May 28, 2021) (21-1043 Resp. C.A. \nBr.).  Those centers serve hundreds of Medicaid \npatients each year.  Pet. App. 7a, 87a. \nPPSAT\u2019s health centers provide essential medical \ncare through Medicaid.  They offer a range of services, \nincluding \nphysical \nexams; \ncancer \nscreenings; \ncontraception; pregnancy testing and counseling; and \nscreening for conditions such as diabetes, depression, \nanemia, cholesterol, thyroid disorders, and high blood \npressure.  Pet. App. 6a, 69a; 21-1043 Resp. C.A. Br. 4.  \nThe health centers provide abortion services, but \nMedicaid does not pay for abortion except in the very \n\n4 \n \n \n \nlimited circumstances required by federal law.  Pet. \nApp. 6a-7a. \nPatients insured through Medicaid choose PPSAT \nfor many reasons.  PPSAT provides non-judgmental, \nhigh-quality medical care.  See Pet. App. 6a-7a.  It also \nhas designed its services to help low-income patients \novercome barriers to accessing care.  Id. at 7a.  For \nexample, PPSAT offers extended hours and flexible \nscheduling; same-day appointments and short wait \ntimes; comprehensive contraceptive care in a single \nappointment; and interpreter services for patients \nwho do not speak English.  Ibid.  PPSAT continued to \noffer high-quality medical care during the COVID-19 \npandemic, including through telemedicine.  21-1043 \nResp. C.A. Br. 5.  That ensured continuity of care for \nlow-income patients and lessened the burdens on \nother parts of the health care system.  Pet. App. 7a-8a \n& n.2.   \nRespondent Julie Edwards is a Medicaid patient \nwho has received care at PPSAT.  Pet. App. 7a.  She \nsuffers from diabetes.  Id. at 44a.  Because doctors \nhave advised her that complications from diabetes \nwould make it dangerous for her to carry a pregnancy \nto term, she sought access to safe and effective birth \ncontrol.  Ibid.  After having difficulty finding a doctor \nwho would treat her, she obtained care at PPSAT.  Id. \nat 7a, 44a.  PPSAT doctors provided her with birth \ncontrol and also informed her that her blood pressure \nwas elevated, so she could obtain follow-up care for \nthat issue.  Ibid.  Ms. Edwards was impressed with \nPPSAT and intends to obtain future gynecological and \nreproductive health care there.  Ibid.   \n3. In July 2018, South Carolina\u2019s Department of \nHealth and Human Services (SCDHHS) terminated \nPPSAT\u2019s participation in the state Medicaid program.  \nPet. App. 8a, 70a.  The termination was prompted by \n\n5 \n \n \n \nthe Governor, who issued two executive orders \ndesigned to withdraw state funding from any \norganization that provides abortions, purportedly \nbased on a twenty-five-year-old statute.  Id. at 8a, 88a; \nsee S.C. Code Ann. \u00a7 43-5-1185. \nRelying on those orders, SCDHHS terminated \nPPSAT\u2019s state Medicaid agreement.  Pet. App. 8a.  \nSCDHHS did not find that PPSAT is unqualified to \nprovide care.  Id. at 87a.  Instead, it terminated \nPPSAT\u2019s participation in Medicaid \u201csolely because \n[PPSAT] performed abortions outside of the Medicaid \nprogram.\u201d  Ibid.  As a result of the termination, \nPPSAT\u2019s health centers immediately had to begin \nturning away Medicaid patients.  Id. at 88a. \n4. Respondents sued under 42 U.S.C. 1983.  Pet. \nApp. 8a.  They alleged, inter alia, that the termination \nviolates the Medicaid Act\u2019s free-choice-of-provider \nprovision.  Ibid.  They sought preliminary injunctive \nrelief, so that Ms. Edwards and other patients could \ncontinue to receive care from their chosen providers.  \nIbid. \nThe \ndistrict \ncourt \nentered \na \npreliminary \ninjunction.  Pet. App. 126a-146a.  As a threshold \nmatter, it held that the Medicaid Act\u2019s free-choice-of-\nprovider requirement is privately enforceable under \nSection 1983 because the statute \u201cunambiguously \nconfers a right\u201d on Medicaid patients to \u201cobtain \nassistance from any qualified and willing provider.\u201d  \nId. at 134a.  Then, on the merits, the court concluded \nthat petitioner likely violated the Medicaid Act by \nterminating PPSAT\u2019s Medicaid participation without \ncause.  Id. at 138a-141a.  The court found it \n\u201cundisputed\u201d that PPSAT is \u201cqualified\u201d to provide \nmedical care, as the statute requires.  Id. at 138a-139a \n(citing 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(23)(A)).   \n\n6 \n \n \n \nThe court of appeals affirmed the preliminary \ninjunction.  Pet. App. 80a-125a.  Like the district \ncourt, the court of appeals concluded that a Medicaid \npatient may sue under Section 1983 to enforce the \nfree-choice-of-provider requirement.  Id. at 94a-98a.  \nApplying this Court\u2019s decisions in Blessing v. \nFreestone, 520 U.S. 329 (1997), and Gonzaga \nUniversity v. Doe, 536 U.S. 273 (2002), the court of \nappeals recognized that a federal statute creates a \nright enforceable under Section 1983 \u201conly when the \nunderlying statute itself unambiguously \u2018confers an \nindividual right\u2019 on the plaintiff.\u201d  Pet. App. 94a \n(quoting Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at 284-285).   \nHere, the court of appeals explained, the statute is \n\u201cunmistakably \nclear\u201d \nin \ncreating \na \nprivately \nenforceable right.  Pet. App. 103a-104a.  \u201cIf th[is] \nlanguage does not suffice to confer a private right, \nenforceable under \u00a7 1983,\u201d the court stated, \u201cit is \ndifficult to see what language would be adequate.\u201d  Id. \nat 102a.  All three judges agreed on this point.  See \nibid.; id. at 120a-125a (Richardson, J., concurring) \n(agreeing that the statute \u201cunambiguously create[s] a \nright privately enforceable under \u00a7 1983\u201d).    \nOn the merits, the court of appeals concluded that \nPPSAT and Ms. Edwards established a likelihood of \nsuccess on the merits because under the free-choice-\nof-provider provision, a state may not exclude a \nqualified and willing provider.  Pet. App. 138a-141a.  \nThe court noted that petitioner did not dispute that \n\u201cPPSAT is professionally qualified to deliver the \nservices that [Ms. Edwards] seeks.\u201d  Id. at 107a; see \nid. at 98a n.3 (\u201cPPSAT\u2019s qualifications are simply not \nin dispute\u201d in this case.).  The court rejected \npetitioner\u2019s argument that it can terminate the \nMedicaid contract of any provider it wishes even when \n\n7 \n \n \n \nit \u201cadmits\u201d that the provider is \u201cperfectly competent.\u201d  \nId. at 109a-110a.   \nPetitioner filed a petition for a writ of certiorari, \nwhich this Court denied.  Baker v. Planned \nParenthood S. Atl., 141 S. Ct. 550 (2020) (No. 19-\n1186). \n5. The district court granted summary judgment \nto PPSAT and Ms. Edwards and entered a permanent \ninjunction.  Pet App. 68a-79a.  The court again held \nthat \nthe \nMedicaid \nAct\u2019s \nfree-choice-of-provider \nprovision is privately enforceable under Section 1983 \nand determined that petitioner violated the Medicaid \nAct by terminating PPSAT\u2019s participation in the state \nMedicaid program.  Id. at 74a.  The court noted that \npetitioner did not dispute that PPSAT is a \u201cmedically \nand professionally qualified provider\u201d and determined \nthat petitioner accordingly had no valid basis for the \ntermination.  Ibid. \nThe court of appeals affirmed.  Pet. App. 38a-64a.  \nThe court again held that Medicaid\u2019s free-choice-of-\nprovider provision confers a right enforceable under \nSection 1983.  Id. at 54a-64a.  The court carefully \nreviewed this Court\u2019s precedents and recognized that \n\u201cnothing \u2018short of an unambiguously conferred right\u2019  \n*  *  *  may support a cause of action.\u201d  Id. at 55a \n(quoting Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at 283).  The statute here, \nthe \ncourt \nexplained, \n\u201cunmistakably \nevinces \nCongress\u2019s \nintention \nto \nconfer \non \nMedicaid \nbeneficiaries a right to the free choice of their \nprovider\u201d because it confers an individual right in \nmandatory terms; courts are competent to determine \nif a provider is qualified; and the Medicaid Act does \nnot provide a comprehensive enforcement scheme that \nshows \nCongress\u2019s \nintent \nto \nforeclose \nprivate \nenforcement.  Id. at 57a-62a.  Again, all three judges \nagreed that the statute unambiguously confers a \n\n8 \n \n \n \nprivate right enforceable under Section 1983.  Id. at \n51a-64a; id. at 65a (Richardson, J., concurring in the \njudgment).  \nThe court of appeals noted that petitioner no \nlonger contested the merits.  Pet. App. 51a.  \nSpecifically, petitioner \u201cd[id] not\u201d renew his merits \narguments \nto \n\u201cchallenge \nthe \ndistrict \ncourt\u2019s \ndetermination (and [the court of appeals\u2019] own \nprevious conclusion) that South Carolina violated\u201d the \nfree-choice-of-provider provision \u201cby terminating \nPlanned Parenthood\u2019s Medicaid provider agreement.\u201d  \nId. at 51a n.1.  \n6. This Court then granted the petition for a writ \nof certiorari in Talevski.  That petition presented two \nquestions:  (1) whether a federal statute that Congress \nenacted using its Spending Clause power can give rise \nto a right enforceable under Section 1983, and \n(2) whether two provisions in the Federal Nursing \nHome \nReform \nAct \n(FNHRA), \n42 \nU.S.C. \n1396r(c)(1)(A)(ii) and 1396r(c)(2)(A), are privately \nenforceable under Section 1983.  See Pet. at *i-ii, \nHealth & Hosp. Corp. of Marion Cnty. v. Talevski, No. \n21-806, 2021 WL 5702312 (Nov. 23, 2021).  The Court \nanswered both questions in the affirmative.  Talevski, \n599 U.S. at 175-191.  In concluding that the provisions \nat issue are privately enforceable under Section 1983, \nthe Court applied its \u201cestablished method for \nascertaining unambiguous conferral\u201d of an individual \nright.  Id. at 183; see id. at 175-191.  \nIn the meantime, petitioner filed a petition for a \nwrit of certiorari in this case.  The Court granted the \npetition, vacated the judgment of the court of appeals, \nand remanded the case for further consideration in \nlight of Talevski.  Kerr v. Planned Parenthood S. Atl., \n143 S. Ct. 2633 (2023) (No. 21-1431). \n\n9 \n \n \n \n7. The court of appeals affirmed.  Pet. App. 1a-\n36a.  \u201c[W]ith the benefit of Talevski\u2019s guidance,\u201d the \ncourt again held that the free-choice-of-provider \nprovision \nconfers \na \nright \nenforceable \nunder \nSection 1983.  Id. at 12a-13a. \nThe court of appeals explained that the free-choice-\nof-provider provision is enforceable under Section \n1983 \nbecause \nit \n\u201cexplicitly \ngives \nMedicaid \nbeneficiaries the right to the provider of their choice\u201d \nand \u201cthere is no indication that Congress wanted to \nforeclose such individuals from seeking relief under \n\u00a7 1983.\u201d  Pet. App. 14a.  On the first point, the court \nreviewed this Court\u2019s precedents and recognized that \n\u201c\u200a\u2018Gonzaga sets forth [the] established method for \nascertaining unambiguous conferral\u2019 of individual \nrights.\u201d  Id. at 19a (quoting Talevski, 599 U.S. at 183).  \nThat test is satisfied, the court continued, \u201cwhere the \nprovision in question is \u2018phrased in terms of the \npersons benefited\u2019 and contains \u2018rights-creating,\u2019 \nindividual-centric language with an \u2018unmistakable \nfocus on the benefited class.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Ibid. (quoting Talevski, \n599 U.S. at 183 (in turn quoting Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at \n284, 287)).   \nHere, the court of appeals explained, the free-\nchoice-of-provider provision unambiguously confers \nrights on individual Medicaid recipients:  \u201cLike the \ntext at issue in Talevski,\u201d the free-choice-of-provider \nprovision \u201cspeak[s] \u2018in terms of the person benefited,\u2019 \nand ha[s] an \u2018unmistakable focus on the benefited \nclass.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Pet. App. 25a (quoting Talevski, 599 U.S. at \n186).  The free-choice-of-provider provision, the court \nexplained, \u201cfocus[es] on discrete beneficiaries and \nguarantee[s] them a choice\u201d of any qualified medical \nprovider \u201cfree from state interference.\u201d  Ibid.  The \ncourt noted that Talevski \u201cbolstered [its] previous \nconclusion\u201d by providing examples of rights-creating \n\n10 \n \n \n \nlanguage \u201csimilar to the language\u201d in the free-choice-\nof-provider provision.  Ibid.   \nPetitioner had argued that the court of appeals \nshould reverse its prior holdings because its decisions \ncited Blessing and Wilder v. Virginia Hospital Ass\u2019n, \n496 U.S. 498 (1990), and in petitioner\u2019s view, those \ndecisions no longer are good law after Talevski.  Pet. \nApp. 14a.  The court of appeals noted that Talevski did \nnot overrule either decision.  Id. at 22a-23a, 28a.  But \neither way, the court explained, \u201cthe central analysis \nremains the same\u201d \u2013 Talevski made clear that courts \nshould \u201clook primarily to Gonzaga\u201d to determine \nwhether Congress unambiguously conferred an \nindividual right, and the court of appeals\u2019 prior \ndecisions \u201cturned upon\u201d that same analysis and \n\u201crelied heavily on Gonzaga.\u201d  Id. at 23a.   \nThe court of appeals then reiterated its conclusion \nthat \nthe \nMedicaid \nAct \ndoes \nnot \nprovide \na \ncomprehensive enforcement scheme that shows \nCongress\u2019s intent to foreclose private enforcement.  \nPet. App. 32a-33a.  The court noted that petitioner \nhad \u201cnot asked us to revisit this question [i]n this \nappeal.\u201d  Id. at 33a. \nFinally, the court of appeals noted that it is \nundisputed that PPSAT is a qualified and willing \nprovider and that petitioner\u2019s decision to terminate \nPPSAT from South Carolina\u2019s Medicaid program was \nunjustified.  Pet. App. 33a-34a.  The court emphasized \nthat petitioner \u201chas not contested\u201d \u2013 at any time \n\u201cduring the long path of this litigation\u201d \u2013 that PPSAT \n\u201cis professionally qualified to provide the care that the \nplaintiff seeks.\u201d  Id. at 33a.  \nJudge Richardson concurred in the judgment.  Pet. \nApp. 35a-36a (Richardson, J., concurring in the \njudgment).  He agreed that the statute here \u201ccreate[s] \n\n11 \n \n \n \nan individual right enforceable under 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1983,\u201d but suggested this Court provide additional \nguidance on the relevant legal standard.  Id. at 36a \n(Richardson, J., concurring in the judgment).     \nARGUMENT \nPetitioner asks this Court (Pet. 15-16) to grant \ncertiorari to address two questions:  (1) whether the \nMedicaid Act\u2019s free-choice-of-provider provision, 42 \nU.S.C. 1396a(a)(23)(A), is privately enforceable under \n42 U.S.C. 1983, and (2) if so, whether the free-choice-\nof-provider provision allows a state to terminate a \nMedicaid provider for any reason, even if the state \nacknowledges that the provider is professionally \nqualified.  This Court\u2019s review is not warranted on \neither question.   \nOn the first question, the court of appeals \nfaithfully applied this Court\u2019s precedents, including \nTalevski, and its conclusion is consistent with that of \nnearly every court that has considered the issue.  \nPetitioner contends (Pet. 31-32) that the courts of \nappeals need guidance on the appropriate test for \ndetermining whether a federal statute is privately \nenforceable under Section 1983.  But Talevski already \nprovided that guidance; the Court reaffirmed that \ncourts should use its \u201cestablished method\u201d (599 U.S. \nat 183) for deciding whether a provision is privately \nenforceable.  This Court has repeatedly denied \npetitions presenting this first question \u2013 including in \nthis case1 \u2013 and it should do the same here.   \n \n1 Baker v. Planned Parenthood S. Atl., 141 S. Ct. 550 (2020) (No. \n19-1186); Gee v. Planned Parenthood of Gulf Coast, Inc., 139 \nS. Ct. 408 (2018) (No. 17-1492); Andersen v. Planned Parenthood \nof Kan. & Mid-Mo., 139 S. Ct. 638 (2018) (No. 17-1340); Betlach \nv. Planned Parenthood Ariz., Inc., 571 U.S. 1198 (2014) (No. 13-\n \n\n12 \n \n \n \nThis case does not present the second question, \nbecause that question concerns whether a patient has \na right to choose an unqualified provider, and \npetitioner has conceded throughout this litigation \nthat PPSAT is a qualified provider.  Further, \npetitioner presented no argument on this issue to the \ndistrict court on summary judgment or to the court of \nappeals in two rounds of briefing on appeal from that \ndecision.  He accordingly has forfeited any argument \nbased on that question.  Even if the question were \npresented here, petitioner\u2019s argument is mistaken, \nand no circuit split exists.  Further review therefore is \nunwarranted.      \nI. \nTHE PRIVATE-RIGHT-OF-ACTION ISSUE \nDOES NOT WARRANT THIS COURT\u2019S \nREVIEW \nPetitioner contends (Pet. 17-32) that the Medicaid \nAct\u2019s \nfree-choice-of-provider \nprovision, \n42 \nU.S.C. 1396a(a)(23)(A), is not privately enforceable \nunder 42 U.S.C. 1983.  He is wrong, and the issue does \nnot warrant the Court\u2019s review.  \nA. The court of appeals\u2019 decision is correct. \n1. Section 1983 authorizes \u201cany citizen of the \nUnited States or other person within [its] jurisdiction\u201d \nto sue any person who, \u201cunder color of\u201d state law, \n\u201cdepriv[ed]\u201d him or her \u201cof any rights, privileges, or \nimmunities secured by\u201d federal law.  42 U.S.C. 1983.  \nA person deprived of a right created by a federal \nstatute by a state actor may sue under Section 1983.  \nSee Maine v. Thiboutot, 448 U.S. 1, 4 (1980). \n \n621); Secretary of Ind. Fam. & Soc. Servs. Admin. v. Planned \nParenthood of Ind., Inc., 569 U.S. 1004 (2013) (No. 12-1039). \n\n13 \n \n \n \nThe federal statute at issue here gives a Medicaid \npatient the right to obtain care from the qualified and \nwilling provider of his or her choice.  It states:  \nA State plan for medical assistance must  *  *  *  \nprovide that  *  *  *  any individual eligible for \nmedical assistance  *  *  *  may obtain such \nassistance from any institution  *  *  *  qualified \nto perform the service or services required  \n*  *  *  [that] undertakes to provide him such \nservices.  \n42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(23)(A).   \nCongress enacted this provision to ensure that \nMedicaid recipients, like other individuals, could \nmake deeply personal choices about where to obtain \nmedical care without states \u201crestricting beneficiaries \nto certain providers.\u201d  Pet. App. 6a; see, e.g., S. Rep. \nNo. 744, 90th Cong., 1st Sess. 183 (1967).  Congress \nthen reiterated the importance of this right in the \nfamily-planning context, providing that even when a \nstate uses a managed-care system, the state cannot \nlimit a patient\u2019s free choice of provider for family-\nplanning services.  See 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(23)(B) \n(cross-reference to 42 U.S.C. 1396d(a)(4)(C)). \n2. In a careful and thorough opinion, the court of \nappeals faithfully applied this Court\u2019s precedents and \ncorrectly concluded that the Medicaid Act\u2019s free-\nchoice-of-provider provision is privately enforceable \nunder Section 1983.  Pet. App. 5a-35a.  All three \njudges agreed that the statute at issue here is \u201cclear \nand \nunambiguous\u201d \nin \nconferring \na \nprivately \nenforceable right.  Id. at 29a; see id. at 36a \n(Richardson, J., concurring in the judgment).  This \nwas not a close call:  The court found it \u201chard to \nconceive of any text  *  *  *  that would permit\u201d a \nprivate right of action \u201c[i]f the language of this \n\n14 \n \n \n \nmedical provider provision does not suffice.\u201d  Id. at \n35a.   \nThe court of appeals began its analysis by carefully \nreviewing this Court\u2019s precedents, including the \nrecent decision in Talevski.  Pet. App. 15a-21a.  \nTalevski applied the Court\u2019s settled precedents to hold \nthat a nursing facility resident could sue under \nSection 1983 to enforce two particular provisions of \nFNHRA.  599 U.S. at 180-191.  In so holding, Talevski \nexplained that \u201c\u200a\u2018Gonzaga sets forth [the] established \nmethod for ascertaining unambiguous conferral\u2019 of \nindividual rights,\u201d and that this test is satisfied \n\u201cwhere the provision in question is \u2018phrased in terms \nof the persons benefited\u2019 and contains \u2018rights-\ncreating,\u2019 \nindividual-centric \nlanguage \nwith \nan \n\u2018unmistakable focus on the benefited class.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Pet. App. \n19a (quoting Talevski, 599 U.S. at 183 (in turn quoting \nGonzaga, 536 U.S. at 284, 287)).  As the court of \nappeals recognized, this Court\u2019s decisions set a \n\u201cdemanding bar\u201d for finding a privately enforceable \nright.  Id. at 22a (quoting Talevski, 599 U.S. at 180). \nApplying that guidance, the court of appeals \ncorrectly concluded that the free-choice-of-provider \nprovision is privately enforceable.  The court \n\u201crigorously examine[d]\u201d the statutory text and \nconcluded that it unambiguously gives Medicaid \npatients an individual right to obtain care from their \nprovider of choice.  Pet. App. 22a, 25a.  The statute \nspecifically defines the intended class of beneficiaries \n(\u201cany individual  *  *  *  eligible for medical assistance\u201d \nunder Medicaid) and gives them a particular right \n(the right to \u201cobtain [care] from any\u201d qualified \nprovider). \n \nId. \nat \n23a \n(quoting \n42 \nU.S.C. \n1396a(a)(23)(A); emphasis omitted).   \nThat language is \u201ca prime example of the kind of \n\u2018rights-creating\u2019 language required to confer a \n\n15 \n \n \n \npersonal right on a discrete class of persons.\u201d  Pet. \nApp. 25a-26a (discussing Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at 284 \nn.3).  It \u201cspeak[s] in terms of the persons benefited and \nha[s] an unmistakable focus on the benefited class.\u201d  \nId. at 25a (quoting Talevski, 599 U.S. at 186).  Indeed, \nthe court explained, Talevski \u201cbolstered\u201d the court\u2019s \nprior conclusion on this point \u201cby providing additional \nexamples of rights-creating language similar to the \nlanguage at issue here.\u201d  Ibid.  \nFurther, the court of appeals found no indication \nin the statutory text that Congress intended to \nforeclose a Section 1983 remedy.  Pet. App. 32a-33a.  \nThere is no \u201cincompatibility between enforcement \nunder \u00a7 1983 and the enforcement scheme that \nCongress has enacted.\u201d  Id. at 32a (quoting Talevski, \n599 U.S. at 187).  That is particularly true, the court \nexplained, because \u201cthere is no way for Medicaid \nbeneficiaries to challenge disqualifications of their \npreferred providers through the administrative \nscheme.\u201d  Ibid.2  Notably, petitioner did not contest \nthis point in the court of appeals.  The court previously \nhad held that \u201cthe Medicaid Act provides no \ncomprehensive enforcement scheme sufficient to \novercome the presumption that the free-choice-of-\nprovider provision is enforceable under \u00a7 1983,\u201d id. at \n32a (quoting id. at 102a), and \u201cSouth Carolina d[id] \n \n2 Petitioner asserts in passing (Pet. 9) that PPSAT was required \nto exhaust state administrative remedies.  But patients such as \nMs. Edwards \u2013 the people with the free-choice-of-provider right \n\u2013 cannot participate in this administrative review process.  And \neven if Ms. Edwards could use that process, both the district \ncourt and court of appeals found that doing so would be \u201cfutile.\u201d  \nPet. App. 101a n.4.  Besides, it is well-established that a person \nis not required to exhaust administrative remedies before filing \nsuit under Section 1983.  Patsy v. Board of Regents of State of \nFla., 457 U.S. 496, 516 (1982); see Pet. App. 101a n.4.   \n\n16 \n \n \n \nnot ask\u201d the court \u201cto revisit this question [i]n this \nappeal,\u201d id. at 33a.  \n3. Petitioner offers two main criticisms of the \ncourt of appeals\u2019 decision.  Pet. 30-32, 36-37.  Neither \nhas merit.  \nFirst, petitioner argues (Pet. 36-37) that the court \nof appeals erred in reading the free-choice-of-provider \nprovision to create an unambiguously conferred right.  \nHe contends (ibid.) that the free-choice-of-provider \nprovision lacks rights-creating language, comparing it \nto the provision in Gonzaga that \u201csp[oke] only in terms \nof institutional policy and practice, not individual[s].\u201d  \n536 U.S. at 288 (discussing 20 U.S.C. 1232g(b)(1)-(2)).  \nThat comparison is inapt.  Whereas the provision in \nGonzaga concerned only institutional \u201cpolic[ies] or \npractice[s],\u201d 20 U.S.C. 1232g(b)(1)-(2), the free-choice-\nof-provider provision addresses whether \u201cindividual\u201d \nMedicaid patients \u201cmay obtain\u201d \u201cmedical assistance\u201d \nfrom \ntheir \nchosen \nproviders, \n42 \nU.S.C. \n1396a(a)(23)(A). \nPetitioner also notes (Pet. 36-37) that the free-\nchoice-of-provider provision does not contain the word \n\u201cright.\u201d  Yet there is no basis for petitioner\u2019s \u201cmagic \nwords\u201d rule.  Pet. App. 26a (quoting Federal Aviation \nAdmin. v. Copper, 566 U.S. 284, 291 (2012)).  The free-\nchoice-of-provider provision has an \u201cunmistakable \nfocus\u201d on the benefited class and is \u201cphrased in terms \nof the persons benefited,\u201d which \u201csatisfie[s]\u201d this \nCourt\u2019s test for whether a statute contains the \nnecessary rights-creating language.  Talevski, 599 \nU.S. at 183. \nSecond, petitioner argues (Pet. 30-31, 35-36) that \nthe court of appeals erred by putting too much weight \non this Court\u2019s decisions in Blessing and Wilder.  That \nis mistaken.  The court of appeals recognized that \n\n17 \n \n \n \n\u201c\u200a\u2018Gonzaga sets forth [the] established method for \nascertaining unambiguous conferral\u2019 of individual \nrights.\u201d  Id. at 19a (quoting Talevski, 599 U.S. at 183).  \nThe court then correctly stated and applied that test, \nexplaining that, for a statutory provision to be \nprivately enforceable, it must unambiguously confer \nan individual right on a particular class of people, and \nit must not include a comprehensive enforcement \nscheme showing a congressional intent to preclude \nprivate enforcement.  Pet. App. 24a-31a, 32a.  \nFurther, the court correctly noted that this Court has \nnot overruled Blessing.  Id. at 22a-23a.  Indeed, as the \ncourt noted (id. at 31a), both Gonzaga and Talevski \ncited Blessing.  See Talevski, 599 U.S. at 189; \nGonzaga, 536 U.S. at 287-289.   \nFar from changing the standard for determining \nwhether a federal law secures rights for Section 1983 \npurposes, the Court in Talevski stated that it was \napplying its \u201cestablished method for ascertaining \nunambiguous conferral\u201d to the federal statute at issue \nin that case.  599 U.S. at 183; see id. at 184-186.  The \ncourt of appeals likewise recognized that, throughout \nthis Court\u2019s line of decisions, the \u201ccentral inquiry\u201d has \nremained the same \u2013 \u201cwhether Congress conferred a \nclear and unambiguous right upon a discrete class of \nbeneficiaries.\u201d  Pet. App. 21a.  The court of appeals \nexplained that this analysis \u201cremains the same\u201d \u201cwith \nor without Blessing,\u201d id. at 23a, and it did not even \ncite Blessing in evaluating whether the free-choice-of-\nprovider provision is enforceable under Section 1983, \nsee id. at 24a-33a.  Instead, as in its prior decisions, it \nfocused on Gonzaga.  Id. at 23a-26a.  Petitioner is \n\n18 \n \n \n \ntherefore wrong to criticize the court of appeals for its \nbrief citations to Blessing.3  \nPetitioner likewise is wrong to say (Pet. 31, 35) \nthat the court of appeals improperly relied on Wilder.  \nThe court cited Wilder only for a narrow proposition \u2013 \nthat a provision in the Medicaid Act can create a \nprivately enforceable right.  Pet. App. 27a, 32a.  That \nis just a statement of the holding in Wilder.  Id. at 27a \n(citing Wilder, 496 U.S. at 509-510 (holding that the \nBoren Amendment is privately enforceable under \nSection 1983)).  That holding has never been called \ninto question by this Court.  In fact, the Court \n\u201capprovingly cited Wilder on this point\u201d in City of \nRancho Palos Verdes v. Abrams, 544 U.S. 113, 122 \n(2005).  Pet. App. 62a.   \nThis Court has questioned other parts of Wilder, \nbut the court of appeals recognized that, stating that \nthis Court has \u201cnoted  * * *  that \u2018[its] later opinions \nplainly repudiate the ready implication of a \u00a7 1983 \naction that Wilder exemplified\u2019\u201d and \u201cexpressly \n\u2018reject[ed] the notion,\u2019 implicit in Wilder, \u2018that [its] \ncases permit anything short of an unambiguously \nconferred right.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Pet. App. 27a-28a (quoting \nArmstrong, 575 U.S. at 330 n.*).   \n \n3  Notably, earlier in this case, petitioner took a different \nposition from the one he takes now; he actually relied on Blessing \nas providing the relevant legal standard.  For example, in his \nappeal of the preliminary injunction, petitioner argued that a \nstatute can give rise to a right enforceable through Section 1983 \nif the factors identified by this Court in Blessing are satisfied.  \nSee, e.g., Pet. C.A. Prelim. Inj. Br. 22-23, No. 18-2133 (4th Cir. \nNov. 26, 2018) (arguing that a plaintiff must \u201cmeet all  * * *  of \nthe[] requirements\u201d from Blessing for \u201ca \u00a7 1983 claim [to] lie\u201d); \nPet. C.A. Prelim. Inj. Reply Br. 3-10, No. 18-2133 (4th Cir. Feb. \n4, 2019) (similar).  This is reason to doubt petitioner\u2019s claimed \nneed for clarification about Blessing.    \n\n19 \n \n \n \nIn any event, the court of appeals explained that \npetitioner\u2019s arguments failed even if he were correct \nthat all of Wilder had been abrogated, because \nTalevski also \u201crejected the argument that provisions \nthat speak to and place obligations on government \nofficials [like the Medicaid Act] cannot create \nindividual rights.\u201d  Id. at 28a; see ibid. (\u201c[E]ven if \n[Wilder were] abrogated  * * *  the State\u2019s argument \nremains unpersuasive.\u201d).  Again, with or without \nWilder, the analysis and outcome remain the same.  \nMore generally, petitioner overstates the supposed \nneed for clarification about the status of Blessing and \nWilder.  The Court had the opportunity to provide \nguidance in Talevski, and it did so, explaining that \nGonzaga provides the relevant test, and that this test \nreflects \nthe \nCourt\u2019s \n\u201cestablished \nmethod \nfor \nascertaining unambiguous conferral\u201d of an individual \nright.  599 U.S. at 183.  All three judges of the court of \nappeals understood that the \u201ccentral inquiry\u201d was \nwhether Congress unambiguously conferred an \nindividual right on Medicaid patients, and all three \njudges agreed that Congress did that here.  Pet. App. \n31a, 35a; see id. at 36a (Richardson, J., concurring in \nthe judgment).  Under those circumstances, there is \nno need for this Court\u2019s review, particularly because \nthis Court \u201creviews judgments, not statements in \nopinions.\u201d  Black v. Cutter Labs., 351 U.S. 292, 297 \n(1956); see Camreta v.

Id. at 357-358. \nThe Fifth Circuit stated that it is \u201cnot clear\u201d that \nthe Fourth Circuit would disagree with its holding, \nbecause that holding was premised on Texas \ndisqualifying the providers based on specific factual \nfindings of a state administrative agency, whereas \nSouth Carolina did not claim any health or safety \nbasis for disqualifying PPSAT.  Kauffman, 981 F.3d at \n365.  Indeed, as the court of appeals here explained, \nSouth Carolina has never contested, \u201cduring the long \npath of this litigation, that Planned Parenthood is \nprofessionally qualified to provide the care that the \nplaintiff seeks.\u201d  Pet. App. 33a.  The Fifth Circuit \ndistinguished private-right-of-action holdings from \nthree other courts of appeals on similar grounds.  \nKauffman, 981 F.3d at 365, 367.   \nThe Eighth Circuit\u2019s decision in Does v. Gillespie, \n867 F.3d 1034 (8th Cir. 2017), is distinguishable for \nthe same reason.  In that case, the Arkansas \nDepartment of Human Services terminated the \nprovider\u2019s participation in the state\u2019s Medicaid \nprogram \u201cfor cause\u201d based on ostensible \u201cevidence [of\u200a] \nunethical\u201d action and \u201cwrongful conduct.\u201d  Id. at 1038.  \nLike the Fifth Circuit, the Eighth Circuit had no \nreason to address whether a patient may challenge \nthe termination of a provider\u2019s Medicaid contract \nwhen the provider\u2019s professional qualifications are \nundisputed. \nFurther, the Eighth Circuit\u2019s decision relied on an \nanalysis that has been foreclosed by Talevski.  That \ncourt did not use the test set out by this Court, which \nfocuses on whether the specific language at issue \nincludes the necessary \u201crights-creating language.\u201d  \n\n23 \n \n \n \nTalevski, 599 U.S. at 183 (quoting Gonzaga, 536 U.S. \nat 290).  Rather than analyze the specific text of 42 \nU.S.C. 1396a(a)(23)(A), the court treated the mere \npossibility of federal enforcement as precluding \nprivate enforcement, Gillespie, 867 F.3d at 1041, a \nview that Talevski expressly rejected, 599 U.S. at 186-\n192.   \nThe Eighth Circuit also focused on the fact that the \nprovision exists within a set of requirements for state \nMedicaid plans.  Gillespie, 867 F.3d at 1041.  But \nTalevski rejected that reasoning as well, explaining \n(in the context of a similar statute) that it is wrong to \nsay that provisions that impose obligations on third \nparties cannot create individual rights.  599 U.S. at \n185.  Further, as the court of appeals noted (Pet. App. \n29a), the Medicaid Act itself refutes that reasoning, \nbecause it expressly instructs that a provision of the \nAct \u201cis not to be deemed unenforceable because of its \ninclusion in a section of [the Act]  * * *  specifying the \nrequired contents of a State plan.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 1320a-2.   \nFinally, the Eighth Circuit\u2019s decision in Gillespie is \nout of step with its own precedent, because in other \nprivate-right-of-action cases, that court has faithfully \napplied Gonzaga.  See, e.g., Spectra Commc\u2019ns Grp. v. \nCity of Cameron, Mo., 806 F.3d 1113, 1120 (8th Cir. \n2015); Lankford v. Sherman, 451 F.3d 496, 508-509 \n(8th Cir. 2006).  The Eighth Circuit should have an \nopportunity to reconsider its analysis in Gillespie in \nlight of these decisions and in light of the guidance \nthis Court provided in Talevski. \n3. There is no urgent need for this Court\u2019s review.  \nContrary to petitioner\u2019s suggestion (Pet. 35-37), the \nquestion presented does not arise frequently.  Since \nthe first appellate decision permitting enforcement of \nthe free-choice-of-provider provision under Section \n1983 (the Sixth Circuit\u2019s decision in Harris in March \n\n24 \n \n \n \n2006), respondents are aware of only twelve district \ncourt decisions involving lawsuits challenging the \ntermination of Medicaid providers through the free-\nchoice-of-provider provision and Section 1983, see \nnote 5, supra (first twelve cases), plus a handful of \ncases challenging other state policies or actions using \nthose statutes, see, e.g., ibid. (next six cases).  All but \nthree of the twelve cases were efforts by states to \ntarget Planned Parenthood in ways courts have \nrecognized \nare \nunwarranted \nand \npolitically \nmotivated.  See, e.g., Bader v. Wernert, 178 F. Supp. \n3d 703, 724 (N.D. Ind. 2016).  They involved \npretextual termination attempts lacking any legal \nbasis or evidentiary support.   \nFurther, the issue has arisen less and less \nfrequently in recent years.  Outside of this case, no \ncourt of appeals has addressed the question presented \nsince 2020.  See note 4, supra.  The small and \ndecreasing number of these cases shows that \npetitioner is wrong to say (Pet. 35) that the court of \nappeals\u2019 decision will lead to additional litigation.  \nThis Court has denied certiorari on this issue multiple \ntimes, see note 1, supra, and the passage of time has \nmade it even more clear that there is no need for this \nCourt\u2019s review.  \nIf this Court potentially were interested in \nconsidering this issue, it should first give the courts of \nappeals the opportunity to consider its recent \nguidance in Talevski.  Only the court of appeals in the \ndecision below \u2013 and no other court \u2013 has had the \nopportunity to consider the effect of Talevski on the \nquestion whether the free-choice-of-provider provision \nconfers a right enforceable under Section 1983.  In \nlight of the decreasing number of cases raising this \nissue, there may never be a need for this Court\u2019s \nreview.  But if petitioner is correct and this remains a \n\n25 \n \n \n \nlive issue, then this Court will have other \nopportunities to consider the issue after other courts \nof appeals have applied the guidance in Talevski. \nII. THE \nUNQUALIFIED-PROVIDER \nISSUE \nDOES NOT WARRANT THIS COURT\u2019S \nREVIEW  \nPetitioner contends (Pet. 33-34) that if the \nMedicaid \nAct\u2019s \nfree-choice-of-provider \nprovision \nconfers an individual right enforceable under Section \n1983, this Court should grant review to decide \nwhether that right extends to providers that a state \nhas labeled \u201c[un]qualified.\u201d  This case does not present \nthat question, because petitioner has conceded \nthroughout the course of this litigation that PPSAT is \na qualified provider.  Further, petitioner forfeited this \nargument by abandoning it in his most recent appeal.  \nThe argument also is mistaken, and there is no \ndisagreement in the courts of appeals on this point.      \nA. Petitioner is wrong to say (Pet. 33) that Ms. \nEdwards is seeking to challenge the exclusion of an \nunqualified provider.  Petitioner in fact has conceded \nat every turn that PPSAT is qualified. \nAs the court of appeals recognized, \u201c[t]here has \nnever been any question during the long path of this \nlitigation that Planned Parenthood is professionally \nqualified to provide the care that plaintiff seeks.\u201d  Pet. \nApp. 33a.  Since the beginning, petitioner has not \ncontested that PPSAT is a qualified provider.  See id. \nat 107a (first court of appeals decision:  \u201cSouth \nCarolina does not contest the fact that PPSAT is \nprofessionally qualified to deliver the services that the \nindividual plaintiff seeks.\u201d); id. at 74a (second court of \nappeals decision:  \u201c[T]here is no dispute as to whether \n[petitioner] asserts PPSAT afforded less than \nadequate care to its patients.  He does not.\u201d); id. at 33a \n\n26 \n \n \n \n(third court of appeals decision:  \u201c\u200aThe State has not \ncontested\u201d \u201cthat Planned Parenthood is professionally \nqualified to provide the care that the plaintiff seeks.\u201d).   \nB. Petitioner has forfeited any argument about \n\u201cthe scope of any alleged right to challenge a state\u2019s \ndisqualification decision\u201d (Pet. 33).  Petitioner made \nan argument along those lines at the preliminary-\ninjunction stage; he argued that he did not violate the \nfree-choice-of-provider provision because a state may \nexclude providers as not \u201c\u200a\u2018qualified\u2019  *  *  *  based on \nany conceivable state interest.\u201d  Pet. App. 109a \n(quoting 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(23)(A)).  Among other \nthings, petitioner relied on O\u2019Bannon v. Town Court \nNursing Center, 447 U.S. 773 (1980).  Pet. App. 111a-\n112a.  But petitioner \u201cd[id] not contest the fact that \nPPSAT is professionally qualified to deliver the \nservices that [Ms. Edwards] seeks.\u201d  Id. at 107a.  The \ndistrict court and court of appeals accordingly rejected \npetitioner\u2019s argument and held that he violated the \nfree-choice-of-provider provision.  Id. at 138a-141a, \n106a-117a.   \nAfter the preliminary-injunction stage, petitioner \nfocused exclusively on the private-right-of-action \nquestion.  On summary judgment in the district court \nand in two rounds of briefing in the court of appeals, \npetitioner argued only that the free-choice-of-provider \nprovision does not give rise to a privately enforceable \nright.  For example, in opposing summary judgment, \npetitioner argued that 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(23)(A) \u201cdoes \nnot authorize a private right of action\u201d for the reasons \n\u201cset forth\u201d in his preliminary-injunction brief.  Pet. D. \nCt. Summ. J. Br. 9, No. 18-cv-2078 (D.S.C. Feb. 24, \n2020).  Petitioner did not argue in the alternative that \nif Section 1983 confers a privately enforceable right, \nhe did not violate that right.  \n\n27 \n \n \n \nThen, on appeal of the summary-judgment \ndecision, petitioner again assumed that PPSAT is \n\u201cqualified\u201d within the meaning of the free-choice-of-\nprovider provision, rather than argue that he did not \nviolate the statute.  See Pet. C.A. Br. 22-30, No. 21-\n1043 (4th Cir. Mar. 29, 2021) (21-1043 Pet. C.A. Br.).  \nIndeed, the court of appeals found it \u201c[n]otabl[e]\u201d that \npetitioner \u201cd[id] not challenge the district court\u2019s \ndetermination (and [the court of appeals\u2019] own \nprevious conclusion) that South Carolina violated this \nprovision.\u201d  Pet. App. 51a n.1.  Petitioner only cited \nO\u2019Bannon for the proposition that the free-choice-of-\nprovider provision is not privately enforceable, id. at \n62a-64a; see 21-1043 Pet. C.A. Br. 22-27; he did not \nseparately argue that his termination of PPSAT\u2019s \nMedicaid participation was justified under O\u2019Bannon.   \nFinally, in his supplemental briefs following \nTalevski, petitioner did not even cite O\u2019Bannon, \ninstead addressing only the private-right-of-action \nissue and arguing that Talevski required the court of \nappeals to reverse its previous holding that the free-\nchoice-of-provider provision is enforceable under \nSection 1983.  Pet. Supp. C.A. Br. 4-16, No. 21-1043 \n(4th Cir. Aug. 23, 2023); Pet. Supp. C.A. Reply Br. 2-\n10, No. 21-1043 (4th Cir. Oct. 13, 2023). \nThe court of appeals did not address petitioner\u2019s \nargument about the scope of the free-choice-of-\nprovider right in 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(23)(A) in the \nsecond appeal because petitioner never presented that \nargument.  This Court should not address the \nargument in the first instance.  See, e.g., Cutter v. \nWilkinson, 544 U.S. 709, 718 n.7 (2005) (\u201c[W]e are a \ncourt of review, not of first view.\u201d).   \nC. To be sure, petitioner\u2019s forfeited argument is \nwrong.  A state may not terminate a provider from \nMedicaid for any reason and then \u201csimply label[]\u201d that \n\n28 \n \n \n \n\u201cexclusionary rule as a \u2018qualification\u2019\u200a\u201d under the free-\nchoice-of-provider provision.  Pet. App. 110a.  The \n\u201cordinary \ndefinition \nof \n\u2018qualified\u2019 \n[is] \nbeing \nprofessionally capable or competent.\u201d  Id. at 107a-\n108a.  Congress adopted that meaning when it \nspecified that \u201cqualified\u201d means \u201cqualified to perform \nthe \nservice \nor \nservices \nrequired.\u201d \n \n42 \nU.S.C. 1396a(a)(23)(A); \nsee \nFederal \nCommc\u2019ns \nComm\u2019n v. AT & T Inc., 562 U.S. 397, 405 (2011) \n(\u201c[W]hen interpreting a statute  *  *  *  we construe \nlanguage  *  *  *  in light of the terms surrounding it.\u201d).   \nA provider \u201cis not made unqualified to perform\u201d \nmedical services \u201cbased on any conceivable state \ninterest.\u201d  Pet. App. 109a.  Instead, a state may \n\u201cconsider[]\u201d a provider not to be \u201cqualified\u201d based only \non the \u201cstandards for the provision of care\u201d that the \nstate has \u201cset.\u201d  S. Rep. No. 744, 90th Cong., 1st Sess. \n183.  Here, South Carolina agreed that PPSAT meets \nthose standards and is professionally capable of \nproviding the care that Ms. Edwards seeks.  See Pet. \nApp. 33a, 58a, 98a n.3, 107a.  South Carolina\u2019s \nargument that \u201cthe term \u2018qualified\u2019 means whatever \nthe state says,\u201d if accepted, \u201cwould strip the free-\nchoice-of-provider provision of all meaning\u201d and would \n\u201ceviscerate the Medicaid Act\u2019s cooperative scheme.\u201d  \nId. at 110a, 116a.   \nD. Finally, and in any event, there is no circuit \nsplit on the unqualified-provider issue.  Petitioner \ncontends (Pet. 33-34) that the Fourth, Seventh, and \nTenth Circuits disagree with the Fifth Circuit on \nwhether O\u2019Bannon holds that the free-choice-of-\nprovider provision does not confer a right to obtain \ncare from a provider that a state has deemed \ndisqualified.  That is incorrect, because the Fifth \nCircuit considered the termination of providers for \ncause, whereas the Fourth, Seventh, and Tenth \n\n29 \n \n \n \nCircuits considered terminations of providers without \ncause.  The different outcomes in the cases are \nexplained by their different facts.    \nSpecifically, O\u2019Bannon rejected nursing home \nresidents\u2019 attempt to challenge the termination of an \nunqualified provider.  447 U.S. at 776-777 & nn.3-4, \n785.  Here, the parties agreed that PPSAT is a \nmedically qualified provider.  The same was true in \nthe Seventh and Tenth Circuit cases.  See Planned \nParenthood of Kan. & Mid-Mo., 882 F.3d at 1236; \nPlanned Parenthood of Ind., 699 F.3d at 978-80.  In \nthat circumstance, O\u2019Bannon said that the patient \ndoes have a right \u201cto choose among a range of qualified \nproviders, without government interference.\u201d  447 \nU.S. at 785; see id. at 785 n.18.  So if O\u2019Bannon applies \nhere, it leads to different results in these different \ncases because they involved different facts.  For that \nreason as well, further review is unwarranted.    \n\n30 \n \n \n \nCONCLUSION \nThe petition for a writ of certiorari should be \ndenied. \nRespectfully submitted. \n \nJENNIFER SANDMAN\nPlanned Parenthood \nFederation of America \n123 William Street \nNew York, NY 10038 \n \nHANNAH SWANSON \nPlanned Parenthood \nFederation of America  \n1110 Vermont Avenue NW, \nSuite 300 \nWashington, DC 20005 \n \n \nNICOLE A.

          "task_beliefs": "My beliefs about the case outcome are now stable and held with high confidence, with this internal reasoning step serving to consolidate my analysis post-SG brief and to strategically plan my next inquiry.\n\n1.  **Core Legal Question & Controlling Test (Stable, Dominant Interpretation):** The central issue remains whether 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a(a)(23)(A) contains \"unambiguously\" rights-creating language under the *Gonzaga*/*Talevski* standard. The Solicitor General's (SG) argument that it does not, based on statutory structure and the high bar set by *Talevski*, has become the foundational framework for my prediction.\n2.  **Petitioner's Argumentative Framework (Stable and Strongly Reinforced):** South Carolina's position is powerfully validated and amplified by the U.S. government. The core arguments\u2014that the provision is a mere administrative requirement in a long list, lacks explicit \"rights\" language, and that the proper remedy is administrative action by HHS\u2014are now the central, most likely path for a majority opinion.\n3.  **Respondent's Position (Stable, Significantly Weakened, Awaiting Rebuttal):** My understanding of the Respondent's arguments (from the BIO) is stable, but their viability is severely diminished. The SG's brief has preemptively and effectively countered their textual and precedential arguments. The most significant remaining uncertainty in the case is how the Respondent's merits brief will attempt to overcome the combined arguments of the Petitioner and the United States. This document now has the highest Expected Information Gain.\n4.  **The U.S. Government's Position (Dominant Signal):** The United States' support for the Petitioner is the single most important signal received to date. The SG's reasoning\u2014framing the provision as a \"non-actionable rule\" to avoid broad private enforcement of Spending Clause statutes\u2014is highly persuasive and likely to be adopted by the Court's majority.\n5.  **The Government's Change in Position (Key Dynamic):** The SG's explicit acknowledgment of the government's change in position (due to the new Administration and the intervening *Talevski* decision) remains a critical fact. It underscores the legal significance of *Talevski* and will be a focal point at oral argument, but it does not weaken the persuasive force of the SG's current legal analysis for the conservative majority.\n6.  **Updated State of Uncertainty (Low, but Focused):** My overall uncertainty about the outcome is very low; a ruling for the Petitioner (South Carolina) is highly probable. My remaining uncertainty is now narrowly focused on the specific counter-arguments the Respondents will raise in their final merits brief. While unlikely to change the outcome, their strategy for dealing with the SG's arguments is the last major piece of the analytical puzzle.\n7.  **Administrative Details (Stable):** All party and counsel information remains stable.",
          "design_beliefs": "This reflective step validates the overall DBOED process, confirming the power of specific heuristics and highlighting the importance of meta-cognitive pauses to guide future actions.\n\n1.  **\"Petitioner-First\" Heuristic:** A confirmed robust starting point.\n2.  **\"The *Talevski* Litmus Test\" (Refined):** Remains the central test. The SG brief confirmed that a key component is **structural analysis**\u2014the provision's placement and context can override beneficiary-focused language.\n3.  **\"Precedent Bracketing\":** A confirmed strategy for defining the legal playing field.\n4.  **Refined Source Prioritization:** The hierarchy is strongly confirmed. The SG's amicus brief is a Tier-1 source in federal statutory cases. The BIO is a valuable blueprint, but the SG can redraw the map.\n5.  **\"The Meta-Cognitive Loop\" & \"Conscious EIG Targeting\" (STRONGLY VALIDATED):** This internal reasoning step is a direct application of this principle. My explicit identification of the SG brief as having the highest EIG was proven correct. Now, this same principle directs me to the Respondent's merits brief as the next logical step, as it holds the most potential to alter my model after the SG's powerful intervention.\n6.  **\"BIO as Merits Blueprint\":** This holds, but with the caveat that intervening events (like a new precedent or a major amicus filing) can significantly alter the strategic landscape.\n7.  **\"Track Changes in Position\":** Confirmed as a critical heuristic for uncovering the legal and political dynamics of a case.\n8.  **\"Structural Arguments Can Trump Beneficiary-Focus Arguments\":** The SG's approach validated this as a key interpretive principle in the post-*Talevski* era for Spending Clause cases.\n9.  **\"Amicus Briefs as Signals\" (Refined):** This is now stratified. The SG's brief is in a class of its own and must be treated as a primary analytical document, not just a supplementary signal.\n10. **\"Prioritize the SG's View in Federal Statutory Cases\":** This heuristic has been proven to be of paramount importance and predictive power.\n11. **\"Argumentative Framing is Key\":** The SG's brief provided a masterclass in using rhetorical framing (\"garden-variety,\" \"non-actionable rule\") to shape the legal debate.\n12. **\"Table of Authorities as a Map\":** Confirmed as a reliable way to identify the controlling precedents in a case.\n13. **NEW Heuristic: \"The Reflective Pause (THINK Step).\"** This observation demonstrates the value of periodically using an internal reasoning step (`THINK`). It serves to consolidate understanding after a major information intake, formally assess confidence levels, and, most importantly, consciously re-evaluate EIG to guide the next, most efficient information-gathering action. It is a crucial mechanism for ensuring a deliberate and focused analytical path."

This action corrects that by targeting the Petitioner's merits brief, which is filed first. \n\nTask EIG (0.4): Moderate. My prediction is already strongly in favor of the Petitioner, primarily due to the Solicitor General's amicus brief. Therefore, the Petitioner's merits brief is expected to be confirmatory, solidifying and detailing arguments I already anticipate. It will add granularity to my understanding of *how* they will win but is unlikely to change my prediction of *who* will win. The potential for a major belief update is low, but it is a necessary document to establish the baseline of the merits-stage arguments.\n\nDesign EIG (0.7): High. This action directly tests and validates several key heuristics. 1) It applies the newly-formed \"Account for Litigation Timing\" heuristic by targeting a document that should be available before the one I previously failed to find. 2) It tests the \"Petitioner-First\" sequencing strategy for merits-stage analysis. 3) It uses precise `field_filters`, testing the \"Verify Search Results\" heuristic.

The any-qualified-\nprovider provision, 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(23)(A), states \nin relevant part: \n(a) Contents \nA State plan for medical assistance must\u2014 \n* * * * * \n(23) provide that (A) any individual eligible \nfor medical assistance \u2026 may obtain such \nassistance from any [provider] qualified to \nperform the service or services required \u2026 \nwho undertakes to provide him such services \n\u2026. \n \n \n \n \n \n\n2 \n \nINTRODUCTION \nThe Medicaid Act is not a civil-rights statute. It \ncreates a cooperative-federalism program in which \n\u201cfederal and state actors work[ ] together \u2026 to carry \nout the statute\u2019s aims.\u201d Health & Hosp. Corp. of \nMarion Cnty. v. Talevski, 599 U.S. 166, 182 (2023). \nUnsurprisingly, the Act focuses on that relationship \nbetween the states and the federal government\u2014not \nthe creation of individual healthcare rights. Indeed, \nCongress wanted states to have substantial discretion \nto innovate with their Medicaid programs. So it made \nthe Act a substantial-compliance regime, giving the \nSecretary of the Department of Health & Human \nServices discretion whether to withhold funding when \na state\u2019s administration of its plan deviates from the \nAct\u2019s specifications. 42 U.S.C. 1396c(2). \nRespondents would have this Court transfer that \ndiscretion to the federal courts by implying a private \nright in the any-qualified-provider provision. But this \nCourt does not recognize private rights in federal \nstatutes \u201cas a matter of course.\u201d Talevski, 599 U.S. at \n183. And Spending Clause legislation, in particular, \nmust clear a \u201cdemanding bar\u201d: it \u201cmust unambig-\nuously confer individual federal rights.\u201d Id. at 180. \nAfter all, the typical remedy in this context \u201cis not a \nprivate cause of action for noncompliance but rather \naction by the Federal Government to terminate funds \nto the State.\u201d Id. at 183 (cleaned up). \nTo clear that high bar, it is not enough that Con-\ngress tried to benefit a specific class. Ibid. Instead, it \nis \u201ccritical\u201d that the statute\u2019s \u201ctext and structure\u201d use \n\u201cexplicit rights-creating terms.\u201d Gonzaga Univ. v. \nDoe, 536 U.S. 273, 284, 286\u201387 (2002). \n\n3 \n \nThe any-qualified-provider provision lacks any \n\u201cclear rights-creating language.\u201d Talevski, 599 U.S. at \n186 (cleaned up). Its text says merely that a plan must \nprovide that an \u201cindividual eligible for medical assis-\ntance\u201d \u201cmay obtain\u201d it from a \u201cqualified\u201d provider. 42 \nU.S.C. 1396a(a)(23)(A). There is no mention of \n\u201crights.\u201d And structurally, the provision is nestled in \na list labeled \u201cContents\u201d setting out 87 disparate \nitems that plans must include. 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a). \nThat text and structure is nothing like FNHRA\u2019s \nrights-creating provisions, which Talevski analyzed. \nTextually, those provisions involve (1) a nursing home \nresident\u2019s \u201cright to be free from\u201d restraints, 42 U.S.C. \n1396r(c)(1)(A)(ii) (emphasis added), and (2) conditions \nrelated to a resident\u2019s \u201c[t]ransfer and discharge \nrights,\u201d 42 U.S.C. 1396r(c)(2) (emphasis added). \nStructurally, both are listed in a bill of rights: \n\u201c[r]equirements relating to residents\u2019 rights.\u201d 42 \nU.S.C. 1396r(c) (emphasis added). And when FNHRA \ndiscusses the choice of a provider, it is unambiguous: \ndeclaring a resident\u2019s \u201cright\u201d \u201cto choose a personal \nattending physician.\u201d 42 U.S.C. 1396r(c)(1)(A)(i) \n(emphasis added). None of that is true here. \nReading a private right into the any-qualified-\nprovider provision would undermine the relationship \nbetween the states and the federal government. \nPrivate enforcement subjects states to unanticipated \n(and expensive) lawsuits. And it takes the Secretary\u2019s \nenforcement flexibility and gives it to federal courts, \nmeaning executive power is taken from the executive \nand given to the judiciary by the judiciary. The Court \nhas set a high bar for recognizing private rights in \nspending statutes\u2014and the any-qualified-provider \nprovision doesn\u2019t clear it. The Court should reverse. \n\n4 \n \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nI. \nStatutory background \nA. Congress passes the Medicaid Act to \nfund state medical programs. \nIn 1965, Congress created Medicaid, \u201ca federal \nprogram that subsidizes the States\u2019 provision of \nmedical services\u201d to families and individuals \u201cwhose \nincome and resources are insufficient to meet the \ncosts of necessary medical services.\u201d Armstrong v. \nExceptional Child Ctr., Inc., 575 U.S. 320, 323 (2015) \n(quoting 42 U.S.C. 1396-1). The program \u201cis a cooper-\native federal-state program that provides medical \ncare to needy individuals.\u201d Douglas v. Indep. Living \nCtr. of S. Cal., Inc., 565 U.S. 606, 610 (2012). \n\u201cLike other Spending Clause legislation, Medicaid \noffers the States a bargain: Congress provides federal \nfunds in exchange for the States\u2019 agreement to spend \nthem in accordance with congressionally imposed con-\nditions.\u201d Armstrong, 575 U.S. at 323. This is \u201ccoopera-\ntive federalism\u2014i.e., federal and state actors working \ntogether\u2014to carry out the statute\u2019s aims.\u201d Talevski, \n599 U.S. at 182 (cleaned up). States create plans and \nsubmit them to the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices for approval and disbursement of funds. 42 \nU.S.C. 1396-1. And if the Secretary later finds that a \nstate has failed to \u201ccomply substantially\u201d with the \nAct\u2019s requirements in the plan\u2019s administration, the \nSecretary may withhold all or part of the state\u2019s funds \nuntil \u201csatisfied that there will no longer be any such \nfailure to comply.\u201d 42 U.S.C. 1396c. \n\n5 \n \nB. Congress adds an any-qualified-provider \nprovision. \nTwo years later, Congress amended the Act to add \nSection 1396a(a)(23)(A) because some states were \nforcing recipients to choose from a very narrow list of \npublic providers. E.g., President\u2019s Proposals for \nRevision in the Social Security System, Hearing on \nH.R. 5710 before the H. Comm. On Ways and Means, \nPart 4 (April 6 and April 11, 1967), at 2273 (Puerto \nRico required Medicaid beneficiaries to receive care at \n\u201cgovernmental facilities\u201d); id. at 2301 (Massachusetts \nrefused to reimburse \u201cprivate physicians\u201d providing \ncare at teaching hospitals). \nThe new provision requires that state plans \n\u201cmust\u201d provide that \u201cany individual eligible for medi-\ncal assistance \u2026 may obtain\u201d it \u201cfrom any [provider] \nqualified to perform the service \u2026 who undertakes to \nprovide\u201d it. 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(23)(A). This provision \nis sometimes called \u201cthe \u2018any-qualified-provider\u2019 or \n\u2018free-choice-of-provider\u2019 provision.\u201d Planned Parent-\nhood of Greater Tex. Fam. Plan. & Preventive Health \nServs., Inc. v. Kauffman, 981 F.3d 347, 354 (5th Cir. \n2020) (en banc). But the former label is more accurate \nbecause the statute does not provide for a \u201cfree choice \nof provider\u201d\u2014beneficiaries may only choose from a \n\u201crange of qualified providers.\u201d O\u2019Bannon v. Town Ct. \nNursing Ctr., 447 U.S. 773, 785 (1980). \nThe Act does not define \u201cqualified.\u201d States retain \nbroad authority to exclude providers \u201cfor any reason \nfor which the Secretary could exclude the individual \nor entity from participation in\u201d the Medicare \nprogram, \u201c[i]n addition to any other authority\u201d states \npossess to exclude providers. 42 U.S.C. 1396a(p)(1). \n\n6 \n \nC. South Carolina creates remedies for \nexcluded providers. \nThe Medicaid Act contemplates that states will \nprovide administrative review and remedies for exclu-\nded providers. E.g., 42 U.S.C. 1396a(kk)(8)(B)(ii) (a \ntermination\u2019s effective date does not occur until \u201call \nappeal rights applicable to such termination have \nbeen exhausted or the timeline for any such appeal \nhas expired\u201d) (emphasis added). So federal regula-\ntions require they do so, mandating that an excluded \nindividual or entity have \u201cthe opportunity to submit \ndocuments and written argument against the exclu-\nsion,\u201d and requiring that the individual or entity \u201cbe \ngiven any additional appeals rights that would \notherwise be available under procedures established \nby the State.\u201d 42 C.F.R. 1002.213. \nAccordingly, South Carolina offers an administra-\ntive appeal with a hearing officer who can take testim-\nony and make findings of fact and conclusions of law. \nS.C. Code Regs. 126\u2013150, 126\u2013152, 126\u2013154. Provid-\ners may retain counsel. S.C. Code Regs. 126\u2013158. And \n\u201c[a]n appeal is not a rubberstamp process for agency \ndeterminations.\u201d S.C. DHHS, Appeals and Hearings \n101, at 3, perma.cc/TV2Y-Y6F2. A provider is also \nentitled to state-court review to determine whether \nthe decision violates statutory provisions or exceeds \nthe agency\u2019s authority, S.C. Code Ann. \u00a7 1-23-380, \nfollowed by this Court\u2019s review, if necessary. Respon-\ndent Planned Parenthood South Atlantic (PPSAT) \nagreed\u2014via its enrollment agreement\u2014that this \nprocess was its \u201cexclusive remedy.\u201d Appendix at A-\n115, A-139, Planned Parenthood S. Atlantic v. Baker, \nNo. 18-2133 (4th Cir. Nov. 26, 2018), ECF No. 15. \n\n7 \n \nII. Factual background \nA. PPSAT is deemed unqualified. \nOn July 13, 2018, South Carolina Governor Henry \nDargan McMaster issued an executive order directing \nthe State Department of Health and Human Services \nto (1) deem abortion providers unqualified to provide \nfamily-planning services under Medicaid, (2) termin-\nate their enrollment agreements, and (3) deny future \napplications from them. Pet.App.159a. That order is \nconsistent with S.C. Code Ann. \u00a7 43-5-1185, which \nprohibits using public funds to pay for abortions. \nBecause money is fungible, giving Medicaid dollars to \nabortion facilities frees up their other funds to provide \nmore abortions. So the Governor concluded that \u201cthe \npayment of taxpayer funds to abortion clinics, for any \npurpose, results in the subsidy of abortion and the \ndenial of the right to life.\u201d Pet.App.157a\u201358a. The \nsame day, the Department notified PPSAT that its en-\nrollment agreements were being terminated because \nit was no longer \u201cqualified to provide services to Medi-\ncaid beneficiaries.\u201d Pet.App.128a. PPSAT can restore \nMedicaid funding if it stops performing abortions\u2014\nbut it has chosen not to do so. \nPPSAT is affiliated with Planned Parenthood \nFederation of America, which provides operational \nand executive support to local offices like PPSAT. \nWhile both entities claim to offer a range of health-\ncare services, they mainly offer abortions, contracep-\ntion, STD testing, other screenings, and experimental \npuberty blockers and cross-sex hormones to those who \nidentify as transgender, including minors. In its most \nrecent annual report, the national entity reported \naborting nearly 400,000 children. Planned Parent-\n\n8 \n \nhood, Annual Report 2022\u201323 at 7, perma.cc/AX2E-\nZKRP. Year over year, Planned Parenthood is per-\nforming more abortions and fewer health services. \nMichael J. New, More Abortions, More Taxpayer \nDollars, and Fewer Health Services, National Review \n(Apr. 17, 2024), perma.cc/E89W-6WL9. \nPPSAT\u2019s two South Carolina locations offer only \ntwo prenatal/postpartum services: pregnancy tests \n(necessary for an abortion) and \u201cmiscarriage care\u201d \n(including treatments for women who intentionally \nterminate their pregnancies with abortion drugs).1 \nPPSAT does not deliver healthy babies or help women \nbecome pregnant, but the Columbia site does offer \nsubsidies for abortions it provides.2 And less than \nthree years before its Medicaid disqualification, \nPPSAT\u2019s Columbia site was threatened with closure \nfor \u201cnon-compliance with the Woman\u2019s Right to Know \nAct, incomplete medical and employee records, \nimproper infectious waste disposal practices, [and] \nfailure to report abortions to DHEC Vital Statistics in \n[a] timely manner, among other violations.\u201d3 \n \n1 Prenatal and Postpartum Services in Columbia, SC, Planned \nParenthood, perma.cc/H7J8-KK6J; Prenatal and Postpartum \nServices \nin \nCharleston, \nSC, \nPlanned \nParenthood, \nperma.cc/TQY4-XDDT. \n2 Pregnancy Testing and Planning in Columbia, SC, Planned \nParenthood, perma.cc/YVH6-ZAH5; Pregnancy Testing and \nPlanning \nin \nCharleston, \nSC, \nPlanned \nParenthood, \nperma.cc/AC5U-H5A6 (noting that the site refers out prenatal \ncare and adoption services); Abortion in Columbia, SC, Planned \nParenthood, perma.cc/C4Z9-75A5. \n3 Matthew Stevens,\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

The any-qualified-\nprovider provision, 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(23)(A), states \nin relevant part: \n(a) Contents \nA State plan for medical assistance must\u2014 \n* * * * * \n(23) provide that (A) any individual eligible \nfor medical assistance \u2026 may obtain such \nassistance from any [provider] qualified to \nperform the service or services required \u2026 \nwho undertakes to provide him such services \n\u2026. \n \n \n \n \n \n\n2 \n \nINTRODUCTION \nThe Medicaid Act is not a civil-rights statute. It \ncreates a cooperative-federalism program in which \n\u201cfederal and state actors work[ ] together \u2026 to carry \nout the statute\u2019s aims.\u201d Health & Hosp. Corp. of \nMarion Cnty. v. Talevski, 599 U.S. 166, 182 (2023). \nUnsurprisingly, the Act focuses on that relationship \nbetween the states and the federal government\u2014not \nthe creation of individual healthcare rights. Indeed, \nCongress wanted states to have substantial discretion \nto innovate with their Medicaid programs. So it made \nthe Act a substantial-compliance regime, giving the \nSecretary of the Department of Health & Human \nServices discretion whether to withhold funding when \na state\u2019s administration of its plan deviates from the \nAct\u2019s specifications. 42 U.S.C. 1396c(2). \nRespondents would have this Court transfer that \ndiscretion to the federal courts by implying a private \nright in the any-qualified-provider provision. But this \nCourt does not recognize private rights in federal \nstatutes \u201cas a matter of course.\u201d Talevski, 599 U.S. at \n183. And Spending Clause legislation, in particular, \nmust clear a \u201cdemanding bar\u201d: it \u201cmust unambig-\nuously confer individual federal rights.\u201d Id. at 180. \nAfter all, the typical remedy in this context \u201cis not a \nprivate cause of action for noncompliance but rather \naction by the Federal Government to terminate funds \nto the State.\u201d Id. at 183 (cleaned up). \nTo clear that high bar, it is not enough that Con-\ngress tried to benefit a specific class. Ibid. Instead, it \nis \u201ccritical\u201d that the statute\u2019s \u201ctext and structure\u201d use \n\u201cexplicit rights-creating terms.\u201d Gonzaga Univ. v. \nDoe, 536 U.S. 273, 284, 286\u201387 (2002). \n\n3 \n \nThe any-qualified-provider provision lacks any \n\u201cclear rights-creating language.\u201d Talevski, 599 U.S. at \n186 (cleaned up). Its text says merely that a plan must \nprovide that an \u201cindividual eligible for medical assis-\ntance\u201d \u201cmay obtain\u201d it from a \u201cqualified\u201d provider. 42 \nU.S.C. 1396a(a)(23)(A). There is no mention of \n\u201crights.\u201d And structurally, the provision is nestled in \na list labeled \u201cContents\u201d setting out 87 disparate \nitems that plans must include. 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a). \nThat text and structure is nothing like FNHRA\u2019s \nrights-creating provisions, which Talevski analyzed. \nTextually, those provisions involve (1) a nursing home \nresident\u2019s \u201cright to be free from\u201d restraints, 42 U.S.C. \n1396r(c)(1)(A)(ii) (emphasis added), and (2) conditions \nrelated to a resident\u2019s \u201c[t]ransfer and discharge \nrights,\u201d 42 U.S.C. 1396r(c)(2) (emphasis added). \nStructurally, both are listed in a bill of rights: \n\u201c[r]equirements relating to residents\u2019 rights.\u201d 42 \nU.S.C. 1396r(c) (emphasis added). And when FNHRA \ndiscusses the choice of a provider, it is unambiguous: \ndeclaring a resident\u2019s \u201cright\u201d \u201cto choose a personal \nattending physician.\u201d 42 U.S.C. 1396r(c)(1)(A)(i) \n(emphasis added). None of that is true here. \nReading a private right into the any-qualified-\nprovider provision would undermine the relationship \nbetween the states and the federal government. \nPrivate enforcement subjects states to unanticipated \n(and expensive) lawsuits. And it takes the Secretary\u2019s \nenforcement flexibility and gives it to federal courts, \nmeaning executive power is taken from the executive \nand given to the judiciary by the judiciary. The Court \nhas set a high bar for recognizing private rights in \nspending statutes\u2014and the any-qualified-provider \nprovision doesn\u2019t clear it. The Court should reverse. \n\n4 \n \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nI. \nStatutory background \nA. Congress passes the Medicaid Act to \nfund state medical programs. \nIn 1965, Congress created Medicaid, \u201ca federal \nprogram that subsidizes the States\u2019 provision of \nmedical services\u201d to families and individuals \u201cwhose \nincome and resources are insufficient to meet the \ncosts of necessary medical services.\u201d Armstrong v. \nExceptional Child Ctr., Inc., 575 U.S. 320, 323 (2015) \n(quoting 42 U.S.C. 1396-1). The program \u201cis a cooper-\native federal-state program that provides medical \ncare to needy individuals.\u201d Douglas v. Indep. Living \nCtr. of S. Cal., Inc., 565 U.S. 606, 610 (2012). \n\u201cLike other Spending Clause legislation, Medicaid \noffers the States a bargain: Congress provides federal \nfunds in exchange for the States\u2019 agreement to spend \nthem in accordance with congressionally imposed con-\nditions.\u201d Armstrong, 575 U.S. at 323. This is \u201ccoopera-\ntive federalism\u2014i.e., federal and state actors working \ntogether\u2014to carry out the statute\u2019s aims.\u201d Talevski, \n599 U.S. at 182 (cleaned up). States create plans and \nsubmit them to the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices for approval and disbursement of funds. 42 \nU.S.C. 1396-1. And if the Secretary later finds that a \nstate has failed to \u201ccomply substantially\u201d with the \nAct\u2019s requirements in the plan\u2019s administration, the \nSecretary may withhold all or part of the state\u2019s funds \nuntil \u201csatisfied that there will no longer be any such \nfailure to comply.\u201d 42 U.S.C. 1396c. \n\n5 \n \nB. Congress adds an any-qualified-provider \nprovision. \nTwo years later, Congress amended the Act to add \nSection 1396a(a)(23)(A) because some states were \nforcing recipients to choose from a very narrow list of \npublic providers. E.g., President\u2019s Proposals for \nRevision in the Social Security System, Hearing on \nH.R. 5710 before the H. Comm. On Ways and Means, \nPart 4 (April 6 and April 11, 1967), at 2273 (Puerto \nRico required Medicaid beneficiaries to receive care at \n\u201cgovernmental facilities\u201d); id. at 2301 (Massachusetts \nrefused to reimburse \u201cprivate physicians\u201d providing \ncare at teaching hospitals). \nThe new provision requires that state plans \n\u201cmust\u201d provide that \u201cany individual eligible for medi-\ncal assistance \u2026 may obtain\u201d it \u201cfrom any [provider] \nqualified to perform the service \u2026 who undertakes to \nprovide\u201d it. 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(23)(A). This provision \nis sometimes called \u201cthe \u2018any-qualified-provider\u2019 or \n\u2018free-choice-of-provider\u2019 provision.\u201d Planned Parent-\nhood of Greater Tex. Fam. Plan. & Preventive Health \nServs., Inc. v. Kauffman, 981 F.3d 347, 354 (5th Cir. \n2020) (en banc). But the former label is more accurate \nbecause the statute does not provide for a \u201cfree choice \nof provider\u201d\u2014beneficiaries may only choose from a \n\u201crange of qualified providers.\u201d O\u2019Bannon v. Town Ct. \nNursing Ctr., 447 U.S. 773, 785 (1980). \nThe Act does not define \u201cqualified.\u201d States retain \nbroad authority to exclude providers \u201cfor any reason \nfor which the Secretary could exclude the individual \nor entity from participation in\u201d the Medicare \nprogram, \u201c[i]n addition to any other authority\u201d states \npossess to exclude providers. 42 U.S.C. 1396a(p)(1). \n\n6 \n \nC. South Carolina creates remedies for \nexcluded providers. \nThe Medicaid Act contemplates that states will \nprovide administrative review and remedies for exclu-\nded providers. E.g., 42 U.S.C. 1396a(kk)(8)(B)(ii) (a \ntermination\u2019s effective date does not occur until \u201call \nappeal rights applicable to such termination have \nbeen exhausted or the timeline for any such appeal \nhas expired\u201d) (emphasis added). So federal regula-\ntions require they do so, mandating that an excluded \nindividual or entity have \u201cthe opportunity to submit \ndocuments and written argument against the exclu-\nsion,\u201d and requiring that the individual or entity \u201cbe \ngiven any additional appeals rights that would \notherwise be available under procedures established \nby the State.\u201d 42 C.F.R. 1002.213. \nAccordingly, South Carolina offers an administra-\ntive appeal with a hearing officer who can take testim-\nony and make findings of fact and conclusions of law. \nS.C. Code Regs. 126\u2013150, 126\u2013152, 126\u2013154. Provid-\ners may retain counsel. S.C. Code Regs. 126\u2013158. And \n\u201c[a]n appeal is not a rubberstamp process for agency \ndeterminations.\u201d S.C. DHHS, Appeals and Hearings \n101, at 3, perma.cc/TV2Y-Y6F2. A provider is also \nentitled to state-court review to determine whether \nthe decision violates statutory provisions or exceeds \nthe agency\u2019s authority, S.C. Code Ann. \u00a7 1-23-380, \nfollowed by this Court\u2019s review, if necessary. Respon-\ndent Planned Parenthood South Atlantic (PPSAT) \nagreed\u2014via its enrollment agreement\u2014that this \nprocess was its \u201cexclusive remedy.\u201d Appendix at A-\n115, A-139, Planned Parenthood S. Atlantic v. Baker, \nNo. 18-2133 (4th Cir. Nov. 26, 2018), ECF No. 15. \n\n7 \n \nII. Factual background \nA. PPSAT is deemed unqualified. \nOn July 13, 2018, South Carolina Governor Henry \nDargan McMaster issued an executive order directing \nthe State Department of Health and Human Services \nto (1) deem abortion providers unqualified to provide \nfamily-planning services under Medicaid, (2) termin-\nate their enrollment agreements, and (3) deny future \napplications from them. Pet.App.159a. That order is \nconsistent with S.C. Code Ann. \u00a7 43-5-1185, which \nprohibits using public funds to pay for abortions. \nBecause money is fungible, giving Medicaid dollars to \nabortion facilities frees up their other funds to provide \nmore abortions. So the Governor concluded that \u201cthe \npayment of taxpayer funds to abortion clinics, for any \npurpose, results in the subsidy of abortion and the \ndenial of the right to life.\u201d Pet.App.157a\u201358a. The \nsame day, the Department notified PPSAT that its en-\nrollment agreements were being terminated because \nit was no longer \u201cqualified to provide services to Medi-\ncaid beneficiaries.\u201d Pet.App.128a. PPSAT can restore \nMedicaid funding if it stops performing abortions\u2014\nbut it has chosen not to do so. \nPPSAT is affiliated with Planned Parenthood \nFederation of America, which provides operational \nand executive support to local offices like PPSAT. \nWhile both entities claim to offer a range of health-\ncare services, they mainly offer abortions, contracep-\ntion, STD testing, other screenings, and experimental \npuberty blockers and cross-sex hormones to those who \nidentify as transgender, including minors. In its most \nrecent annual report, the national entity reported \naborting nearly 400,000 children. Planned Parent-\n\n8 \n \nhood, Annual Report 2022\u201323 at 7, perma.cc/AX2E-\nZKRP. Year over year, Planned Parenthood is per-\nforming more abortions and fewer health services. \nMichael J. New, More Abortions, More Taxpayer \nDollars, and Fewer Health Services, National Review \n(Apr. 17, 2024), perma.cc/E89W-6WL9. \nPPSAT\u2019s two South Carolina locations offer only \ntwo prenatal/postpartum services: pregnancy tests \n(necessary for an abortion) and \u201cmiscarriage care\u201d \n(including treatments for women who intentionally \nterminate their pregnancies with abortion drugs).1 \nPPSAT does not deliver healthy babies or help women \nbecome pregnant, but the Columbia site does offer \nsubsidies for abortions it provides.2 And less than \nthree years before its Medicaid disqualification, \nPPSAT\u2019s Columbia site was threatened with closure \nfor \u201cnon-compliance with the Woman\u2019s Right to Know \nAct, incomplete medical and employee records, \nimproper infectious waste disposal practices, [and] \nfailure to report abortions to DHEC Vital Statistics in \n[a] timely manner, among other violations.\u201d3 \n \n1 Prenatal and Postpartum Services in Columbia, SC, Planned \nParenthood, perma.cc/H7J8-KK6J; Prenatal and Postpartum \nServices \nin \nCharleston, \nSC, \nPlanned \nParenthood, \nperma.cc/TQY4-XDDT. \n2 Pregnancy Testing and Planning in Columbia, SC, Planned \nParenthood, perma.cc/YVH6-ZAH5; Pregnancy Testing and \nPlanning \nin \nCharleston, \nSC, \nPlanned \nParenthood, \nperma.cc/AC5U-H5A6 (noting that the site refers out prenatal \ncare and adoption services); Abortion in Columbia, SC, Planned \nParenthood, perma.cc/C4Z9-75A5. \n3 Matthew Stevens, SC DHEC files orders to shut down Planned \nParenthood, Fox 57 (Sept. 11, 2015), perma.cc/RJ49-US3U. \n\n9\nWhile PPSAT operates only two sites in the \nState\u2014in Charleston and Columbia\u2014South Carolina \nhas 140 federally qualified health clinics and preg-\nnancy centers, not counting the numerous private \nhealth providers who accept Medicaid:\nWomen Have Real Choices, Charlotte Lozier Inst., \nperma.cc/8QFG-RJ47. In the population centers of \nCharleston County and Richland County (where \nPPSAT Columbia is located), there are dozens of med-\nical clinics that accept Medicaid and offer a broad \npanoply of health services. Healthy Connections Medi-\ncaid Search for Providers, S.C. Dep\u2019t Health & Hum. \nServs., img1.scdhhs.gov/search4aprovider/.\nFor example, Waverly Women\u2019s Health\u2014a Coop-\nerative Health Medicaid provider a mere 1.4-mile \ndrive from PPSAT Columbia\u2014provides 11 different \nservices and treats 11 different conditions for women. \n\n10 \n \nPPSAT Columbia provides less than half those \nservices and treats only one of those conditions, as a \ncomparison of their websites reveals:  \n \n \n \n \n\n11 \n \nAnd because Waverly Women\u2019s Health is part of \nCooperative Health\u2014a broad network of medical \ncenters\u2014women who go there have access to a pano-\nply of comprehensive services, including family medi-\ncine, internal medicine, vision, diabetes management, \nchronic disease management, and substance abuse \ntreatment. Our Medical Services, Cooperative Health, \nperma.cc/AS69-G5FS. So a Medicaid beneficiary who \nvisits Waverly Women\u2019s Health for birth control will \nreceive care for her other medical issues, too.  \nConsider Respondent Julie Edwards\u2019s experience. \nShe has reported multiple serious health concerns, \nsuch as Type 1 diabetes (with complications), partial \nblindness, and nerve damage. Decl. of Julie Edwards \n\u00b6 2, J.A.29. But when she went to PPSAT, she was \noffered birth control and advised to seek care else-\nwhere for her elevated blood pressure. Resp. Br. for \nAppellees at 6, Planned Parenthood S. Atlantic v. \nKerr, 27 F.4th 945 (4th Cir. 2022) (No. 21-1043). In \ncontrast, at Waverly Women\u2019s Health, she would have \nbeen offered birth control and in-network access to \nservices addressing her diabetes and other serious \nconditions. \nDisqualifying abortion providers like PPSAT \nensures that women receive comprehensive medical \ncare. It also ensures that South Carolina\u2019s Medicaid \nfunding goes toward improving \u201caccess to necessary \nmedical care and important women\u2019s health and \nfamily planning services\u201d for all women\u2014rather than \nimproving Planned Parenthood\u2019s ability to free up \nfunding to pay for abortions. Pet.App.158a. \n\n12 \n \nB. Edwards and PPSAT sue in federal \ncourt. \nTwo weeks after the disqualification, Respon-\ndents PPSAT and Julie Edwards, one of its Medicaid \nclients, sued in federal court. J.A.1\u201317. Three days \nlater, they moved for a preliminary injunction, argu-\ning that by disqualifying PPSAT as a Medicaid pro-\nvider, South Carolina violated Ms. Edwards\u2019s right to \nthe \u201cqualified provider of [her] choosing under 42 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 1396a(a)(23).\u201d Pls.\u2019 Mot. for TRO and Prelim. \nInj. at 1, Planned Parenthood S.

Inj. at \n3, 9, 11, Planned Parenthood S. Atlantic v. Baker, No. \n3:18-cv-02078 (D.S.C. Aug. 13, 2018), PPSAT belated-\nly filed an administrative appeal that remains unre-\nsolved pending the outcome of this litigation. \nIII. Decisions below \nA. District court grants preliminary injunc-\ntion, and the Fourth Circuit affirms. \nThe district court granted Ms. Edwards\u2019s motion \nfor a preliminary injunction and, because that ruling \nresolved the issue, did not analyze PPSAT\u2019s right to \nthe same relief. Pet.App.127a, 146a. On the \u201cissue of \nwhether \u00a7 1396a(a)(23)(A) creates a private right of \naction enforceable through \u00a7 1983,\u201d the court applied \nthe so-called Blessing factors\u2014named for Blessing v. \nFreestone, 520 U.S. 329 (1997)\u2014and said that it does. \nPet.App.132a\u201336a. \n\n13 \n \nThe Fourth Circuit affirmed. In analyzing wheth-\ner \u201cCongress\u2019s intent to create an individual right \nenforceable under \u00a7 1983\u201d in the any-qualified-\nprovider provision is \u201cunambiguous,\u201d Pet.App.83a, \nthat court also applied the Blessing factors, assessed \nwhether Congress had \u201cforeclosed a \u00a7 1983 remedy,\u201d \nand then joined the circuits that had found \u201c a private \nright enforceable under \u00a7 1983.\u201d Pet.App.95a\u2013102a. \nThe court cited\u2014but did not discuss\u2014the Eighth \nCircuit\u2019s contrary holding in Does v. Gillespie, 867 \nF.3d 1034 (8th Cir. 2017). Pet.App.96a, 103a. \nConcurring, Judge Richardson wrote separately \nto call for clarity: \u201cWhat is the proper framework for \ndetermining whether a given statute creates a right \nthat is privately enforceable \u2026?\u201d Pet.App.121a. And \nmore specifically, has Wilder v. Virginia Hospital \nAssociation, 496 U.S. 498 (1990), \u201cbeen repudiated (or \neven effectively overruled)?\u201d Ibid. \nB. District court grants permanent injunc-\ntion, and the Fourth Circuit affirms. \nWhile a petition for certiorari was pending, the \ndistrict court granted summary judgment to Respond-\nents and directed them to submit a draft order \ngranting a permanent injunction. Pet.App.69a, 78a\u2013\n79a. Five days later, they filed a brief in this Court \narguing that the Court should deny the State\u2019s \npetition because it was about to become moot. Suppl. \nBr. for Resp\u2019ts, Baker v. Planned Parenthood S. Atl., \n141 S. Ct. 550 (2020) (No. 19-1186). And the Court \nsubsequently denied the petition. Baker, 141 S. Ct. \n550 (2020). \n \n\n14 \n \nMeanwhile, the district court entered an order \npermanently enjoining Petitioner from \u201cterminating \nor excluding\u201d PPSAT from South Carolina\u2019s Medicaid \nprogram based on its abortion activities. Pet.App.67a. \nAnd Petitioner appealed to the Fourth Circuit again. \nOn appeal, the Fourth Circuit acknowledged that \nthe en banc Fifth Circuit in Kauffman had recently \nheld that the any-qualified-provider provision does \nnot create private rights, Pet.App.51a\u201352a, but the \nFourth Circuit still refused to \u201creconsider [its] \nprevious panel decision,\u201d Pet.App.51a. \nConcurring only in the judgment, Judge Richard-\nson wrote separately to implore this Court to clear up \nthe \u201cconfusion and uncertainty\u201d in the caselaw. \nPet.App.65a. \u201cGonzaga arguably laid down a different \ntest than Wilder and Blessing,\u201d he explained. Ibid. \nBut until this Court plainly repudiates them, lower \ncourts \u201cremain[ ] bound by Blessing and Wilder.\u201d Ibid. \nThe State filed a second petition for certiorari. \nC. After a GVR, the Fourth Circuit affirms \nagain. \nTwo months later, the Court granted certiorari in \nTalevski. Its opinion reaffirmed that \u201cGonzaga sets \nforth [the Court\u2019s] established method for ascer-\ntaining unambiguous conferral\u201d of private rights in \nthe Spending Clause context. Talevski, 599 U.S. at \n183. But the Court said nothing about the ongoing \nvalidity of Wilder or Blessing. The Court then GVR\u2019d \nthis case. Pet.App.37a. \n \n\n15 \n \nOn remand, the Fourth Circuit reaffirmed its \nprior decisions. Pet.App.12a\u201313a. Talevski, the court \nwrote, \u201coffered an illuminating analysis\u201d and \u201ca useful \nnew example of provisions enforceable via \u00a7 1983,\u201d \nbut the court did \u201cnot read it as toppling the existing \ndoctrinal regime.\u201d Pet.App.4a. Wilder remained good \nlaw, and the court (wrongly) thought that it \u201cwould \nappear to doom the State\u2019s argument at the starting \ngate.\u201d Pet.App.27a\u201328a. Finally, while Talevski had \n\u201cshed some new light on Blessing,\u201d it was not the \nFourth Circuit\u2019s \u201cprerogative to proclaim a Supreme \nCourt precedent overthrown.\u201d Pet.App.21a\u201322a.  \nAgain concurring only in the judgment, Judge \nRichardson noted that he had written separately \ntwice before \u201cto ask for clarity on the precedential \nstatus of Wilder \u2026 and, to a lesser extent, Blessing.\u201d \nPet.App.35a. He did so for a third time \u201cbecause even \nafter [Talevski],\u201d lower courts still \u201clack the guidance \ninferior judges need.\u201d Pet.App.35a\u201336a. They \u201clack \nsufficiently clear signals to be sure [this] Court has \ndiscarded Wilder\u2019s holding (or Blessing\u2019s test).\u201d \nPet.App.36a n.2. So the court was \u201cbound to stand by \n[its] previous holding.\u201d Pet.App.36a. \nThis Court granted certiorari. \n \n \n\n16 \n \nSUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT \nThis Court has set a high bar for finding that a \nSpending Clause statute confers a federal right enfor-\nceable under Section 1983. The Medicaid Act\u2019s any-\nqualified-provider provision doesn\u2019t clear it. Congress \nmust speak with a \u201cclear voice\u201d and an \u201cunambiguous \nintent to confer individual rights\u201d for such a provision \nto confer a private right. Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at 280 \n(cleaned up). Congress must use unambiguously clear \nrights-creating language. Congress did not use such \nlanguage in the any-qualified-provider provision; the \nprovision says nothing about rights at all. \nTo date, this Court has identified only four provi-\nsions with clear rights-creating language: the two \nresidents\u2019-rights provisions in Talevski and the two \n\u201cNo person shall\u201d provisions in Title VI of the Civil \nRights Act of 1964 and Title IX of the Education \nAmendments of 1972. Congress used such language \nin Talevski by labeling the benefits conferred there as \n\u201crights.\u201d And the \u201cNo person shall\u201d language in Titles \nVI and IX\u2014two civil-rights statutes\u2014closely mirrors \nthe text of the Fifth Amendment. \nIn contrast, the any-qualified-provider provision, \nwhich says only that \u201cany individual \u2026 may obtain\u201d \nassistance from any \u201cqualified\u201d provider, does not \nspeak about \u201crights\u201d or use clear rights-creating \nlanguage lifted from the Constitution\u2019s Bill of Rights. \nAbsent such language, the \u201ctypical remedy for state \nnoncompliance with federally imposed conditions is \nnot a private cause of action \u2026 but rather action by \nthe Federal Government to terminate funds to the \nState.\u201d Pennhurst State Sch. & Hosp. v. Halderman, \n451 U.S. 1, 28 (1981). \n\n17 \n \nThis Court has carefully cabined prior opinions \nthat some lower courts have read to establish \u201ca \nrelatively loose standard for finding rights enforce-\nable by \u00a7 1983.\u201d Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at 282. But while \nthe Court has abandoned the so-called Blessing \nfactors and limited Wilder and Wright v. City of \nRoanoke Redevelopment and Housing Authority, 479 \nU.S. 418 (1987), to their facts, the Court has not yet \nexpressly overruled them or explicitly said that it has \nabandoned them. And that has left lower courts won-\ndering if they\u2019re bound to apply them. This case is a \nchance to provide much-needed clarity: the Court \nshould reiterate that it has abandoned Blessing\u2019s \nmulti-factored test and limited Wright and Wilder to \nspecific facts not implicated here. The Court should \nthen apply Gonzaga and Talevski and reverse. \nARGUMENT \nI. \nThe any-qualified-provider provision does \nnot create a private right.  \nA. Only clear rights-creating terms create a \nprivate right in spending laws. \nThe \u201clegitimacy\u201d of Congress\u2019s exercise of its \nspending power depends on a state\u2019s voluntary and \nknowing acceptance of terms. Pennhurst, 451 U.S. at \n17. \u201cRespecting this limitation is critical to ensuring \nthat Spending Clause legislation does not undermine \nthe status of the States as independent sovereigns in \nour federal system.\u201d Nat\u2019l Fed\u2019n of Indep. Bus. v. \nSebelius, 567 U.S. 519, 577 (2012) (Roberts, C.J., \nplurality). So \u201cif Congress intends to impose a con-\ndition on the grant of federal moneys, it must do so \nunambiguously.\u201d Pennhurst, 451 U.S. at 17. \n\n18 \n \nAbiding by that \u201cwell-established requirement\u201d \nensures states receive the \u201cclear notice\u201d they deserve. \nTalevski, 599 U.S. at 180 n.8. And \u201c[b]y insisting that \nCongress speak with a clear voice,\u201d the Court enables \nstates to \u201cexercise their choice knowingly, cognizant \nof the consequences of their participation.\u201d Pennhurst, \n451 U.S. at 17. \nThat clear-statement rule applies when a private \nparty claims an enforceable right based on a provision \nin a Spending Clause statute like the Medicaid Act. \n\u201c[U]nless Congress speaks with a clear voice and \nmanifests an unambiguous intent to confer individual \nrights, federal funding provisions provide no basis for \nprivate enforcement by \u00a7 1983.\u201d Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at \n280 (cleaned up). That makes sense because Section \n1983 creates a cause of action for \u201cthe deprivation of \nany rights, privileges, or immunities secured by\u201d \nfederal law. 42 U.S.C. 1983 (emphasis added). \nAt least since Gonzaga, this Court has been clear \nthat it will not \u201cpermit anything short of an unambig-\nuously conferred right to support a cause of action \nbrought under \u00a7 1983.\u201d 536 U.S. at 283. As the Court \nreiterated in Talevski, that is a \u201cdemanding bar\u201d and \na \u201csignificant hurdle.\u201d 599 U.S. at 180, 184; accord id. \nat 193 (Barrett, J., concurring) (\u201cThis bar is high, and \nalthough the FNHRA clears it, many federal statutes \nwill not.\u201d); id. at 230 (Alito, J., dissenting) (agreeing \nabout the \u201chigh bar\u201d). \n \n \n \n\n19 \n \nSection \u201c1983 actions are the exception\u2014not the \nrule\u2014for violations of Spending Clause statutes.\u201d Id. \nat 193\u201394 (Barrett, J., concurring). So the question is \n\u201cwhether this is the atypical case\u201d in which a \nSpending Clause provision \u201cunambiguously confer[s] \nindividual rights, making those rights presumptively \nenforceable under \u00a7 1983.\u201d Id. at 183 (emphasis \nadded) (cleaned up). It is not. \n\u201cGonzaga sets forth [the Court\u2019s] established \nmethod for ascertaining unambiguous conferral.\u201d \nTalevski, 599 U.S. at 183. Under that test, it\u2019s not \nenough that a \u201cplaintiff falls within the general zone \nof interest that the statute is intended to protect.\u201d \nGonzaga, 536 U.S. at 283. Rather, a court must exam-\nine the statute\u2019s \u201ctext and structure\u201d and determine \nwhether a plaintiff has made the \u201ccritical\u201d showing \u201cof \n\u2018rights-creating\u2019 language.\u201d Id. at 286, 287 (emphasis \nadded) (citing Alexander v. Sandoval, 532 U.S. 275, \n288\u201389 (2001), and Cannon v. Univ. of Chi., 441 U.S. \n677, 690 n.13 (1979)). \nAnd if a provision does have clear rights-creating \nlanguage, a plaintiff still must show that such lan-\nguage is \u201cphrased in terms of the persons benefitted,\u201d \nwith \u201can unmistakable focus on the benefitted class.\u201d \nGonzaga, 536 U.S. at 284, 287 (cleaned up); accord \nUniversities Rsch. Ass\u2019n, Inc. v. Coutu, 450 U.S. 754, \n772 n.23 (1981) (quoting U.S. for Benefit & on Behalf \nof Glynn v. Capeletti Bros., 621 F.2d 1309, 1314 (5th \nCir. 1980)). That means \u201cthe Gonzaga test is satisfied \nwhere the provision in question [1] is phrased in \nterms of the persons benefitted\u201d \u201cwith an unmistak-\nable focus on the benefited class\u201d \u201cand [2] contains \nrights-creating, individual-centric language.\u201d Talev-\nski, 599 U.S. at 183 (emphasis added) (cleaned up). \n\n20 \n \nIn sum, the \u201cquestion is not simply who would \nbenefit from the Act, but whether Congress intended \nto confer federal rights upon those beneficiaries.\u201d \nCalifornia v. Sierra Club, 451 U.S. 287, 294 (1981). \nAnd \u201crights-creating language\u201d is \u201ccritical\u201d to that \nshowing. Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at 287 (cleaned up). \nB. The \nany-qualified-provider \nprovision \nlacks clear rights-creating language. \nThe any-qualified-provider provision has nothing \napproaching the \u201cclear rights-creating language\u201d that \nwould make this the \u201catypical case.\u201d Talevski, 599 \nU.S. at 183, 186 (cleaned up). The provision requires \nonly that state plans provide that \u201cany individual \neligible for medical assistance \u2026 may obtain such \nassistance from any institution, agency, community \npharmacy, or person, qualified to perform the service \nor services required \u2026 who undertakes to provide \u2026 \nsuch services.\u201d 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(23)(A). \nFirst and foremost, the text never mentions the \nword \u201cright\u201d or its functional equivalent. Compare \nwith Talevski, 599 U.S. at 184\u201385 (residents\u2019 \u201cright to \nbe free from\u201d restraints; \u201ctransfer and discharge \nrights\u201d) (cleaned up). Nor is it framed using the \nrights-creating \u201cNo person shall\u201d language Congress \nborrowed from the Bill of Rights when it enacted the \ncivil-rights statutes contained in Titles VI and IX. \nViewed contextually, the provision also does not \n\u201creside in\u201d a part of the Medicaid Act that \u201cexpressly \nconcerns\u201d requirements \u201crelating to [beneficiaries\u2019] \nrights.\u201d Talevski, 599 U.S. at 184 (cleaned up). \nInstead, it resides in 42 U.S.C. 1396a, titled \u201cState \nplans for medical assistance,\u201d under subsection (a), \nwhich is simply titled \u201cContents.\u201d 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a). \n\n21 \n \nThe provision also limits the scope of the benefit \nto \u201cqualified\u201d providers while later acknowledging the \nstates\u2019 authority to decide what makes a provider \nqualified. See 42 U.S.C. 1396a(p)(1) (\u201cIn addition to \nany other authority, a State may exclude any indi-\nvidual or entity for purposes of participating under \nthe State plan under this subchapter for any reason \nfor which the Secretary could exclude the individual \nor entity \u2026.\u201d) (emphasis added). Letting the regulated \nentity\u2014here the state\u2014decide the scope of the right \nwould be an odd way to bestow a right. For example, \nit would have made no sense for the Framers to \nqualify the First Amendment\u2019s Free Speech Clause by \nallowing the regulated entity\u2014Congress\u2014to define \nwhat qualifies as \u201cspeech.\u201d U.S. Const. amend. I. Or \nfor Congress to qualify Title IX by allowing the \nregulated entities\u2014schools\u2014to define what counts as \n\u201cdiscrimination.\u201d 20 U.S.C. 1681(a). Or for Congress \nin FNHRA to allow nursing homes to decide what \ncounts as \u201crestraints.\u201d 42 U.S.C. 1396r(c)(1)(A)(ii). \nTrue rights-creating language doesn\u2019t work that way. \nWhat\u2019s more, the provision speaks of \u201cobtain[ing]\u201d \na benefit from a third party. But that\u2019s quite unlike \nclear rights-creating language, which confers a right \ndirectly and in explicit terms. For example, FNHRA \ndid not say that any resident in a covered nursing \nhome \u201cmay obtain\u201d an environment free of physical or \nchemical restraints. Nor did it say that any resident \n\u201cmay obtain\u201d advance notice of a transfer or dis-\ncharge. Likewise, Congress did not write Title IX to \nsay any citizen \u201cmay obtain\u201d the benefits of a federally \nfunded education program free of sex discrimination. \nWhen Congress wants to create a private right, it \nconfers that right expressly and directly. \n\n22 \n \nTellingly, in enacting Section 1396a, Congress \nspecifically did invoke the words \u201cright\u201d and \u201crights\u201d \nin several places\u2014five times in the context of pay-\nments and a few more in the context of whistle-\nblowers, notifications about the right to accept or \nrefuse treatment, and the disregard of certain \nproperty in determining the eligibility of Indians. 42 \nU.S.C. \n1396a(a)(25)(H)\u2013(I), \n(a)(45), \n(a)(68)(C), \n(w)(1)(A), (ff)(3)\u2013(4). The only other mentions of \n\u201crights\u201d in Section 1396a are when Congress is discus-\nsing administrative appeals, both for individuals, 42 \nU.S.C. 1396a(ee)(4), and for providers, 42 U.S.C. \n1396a(kk)(8)(B). \nCongress chose not to mention rights when direct-\ning participating states to include the any-qualified-\nprovider provision in their plans. So at best, Respon-\ndents have to infer that Congress created a private \nright. And \u201can inference is not \u2018an unambiguously \nconferred right.\u2019\u201d Kauffman, 981 F.3d at 360 (quoting \nGonzaga, 536 U.S. at 283); accord 31 Foster Child. v. \nBush, 329 F.3d 1255, 1270 (11th Cir. 2003) \n(\u201cAmbiguity precludes enforceable rights.\u201d). \nOn its plain text, then, the any-qualified-provider \nprovision, like many statutes, may confer a benefit. \nAnd Ms. Edwards may even be within the statute\u2019s \nzone of interests. But that\u2019s not enough to unambigu-\nously confer a private right. The provision\u2019s text and \nstructure are devoid of any language resembling what \nthis Court has deemed clear rights-creating language. \nGonzaga\u2019s \u201cdemanding bar,\u201d Talevski, 599 U.S. at 180 \n(citing Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at 280), requires far more. \n\n23 \n \nC. The Court should retain its bright lines \nabout what qualifies as clear rights-\ncreating language. \nThus far, this Court has limited \u201cclear rights-\ncreating language\u201d to statutes where Congress \nexplicitly uses the label \u201cright\u201d or lifts language from \nthe rights-creating provisions of the Constitution. To \nkeep Gonzaga\u2019s bar \u201cdemanding,\u201d the Court should \nhold that line. The any-qualified-provider provision \nfalls far short, as this Court\u2019s precedents prove.  \n1. Talevski proves Congress can clearly \nconfer a private right by explicitly \nlabeling a benefit a \u201cright.\u201d  \nIn Talevski, this Court held that two provisions of \nFNHRA that explicitly reference \u201crights of nursing- \nhome residents to be free from unnecessary\u201d \nrestraints and to receive pre-discharge notice \u201cunam-\nbiguously create \u00a7 1983-enforceable rights.\u201d 599 U.S. \nat 171\u201372 (emphasis added). The provisions satisfied \n\u201cGonzaga\u2019s stringent standard\u201d given their \u201cclear \nrights-creating language.\u201d Id. at 186 (cleaned up). \n\u201cTo start, \u2026 both [the unnecessary-restraint and \npredischarge-notice provision] reside in 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1396r(c), which expressly concerns \u2018[r]equirements \nrelating to residents\u2019 rights.\u2019\u201d Id. at 184 (quoting 42 \nU.S.C. 1396r(c)). As this Court explained it, \u201c[t]his \nframing is indicative of an individual \u2018rights-creating\u2019 \nfocus.\u201d Ibid. (quoting Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at 284). \n\u201cExamined further,\u201d the provisions\u2019 text \u201cunambig-\nuously confers rights upon the residents of nursing-\nhome facilities.\u201d Ibid. \n\n24 \n \nThe unnecessary-restraint provision appears in a \nstatutory subsection called \u201cGeneral rights\u201d and in a \nsubsubsection titled \u201cSpecified rights.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \n1396r(c)(1)(A) (emphasis added). That provision \nrequires nursing homes to \u201cprotect and promote\u201d the \nrights of each resident, including \u201c[t]he right to be free \nfrom \u2026 any physical or chemical restraints \u2026 not \nrequired to treat the resident\u2019s medical symptoms.\u201d \nTalevski, 599 U.S. at 184 (quoting 42 U.S.C. \n1396r(c)(1)(A)(ii)). The provision sits alongside addi-\ntional provisions that protect \u201c[t]he right to choose a \npersonal attending physician\u201d (more on this in a \nmoment), \u201c[t]he right to privacy,\u201d \u201c[t]he right to \nconfidentiality,\u201d the \u201cright \u2026 to reside and receive \nservices with reasonable accommodation of individual \nneeds,\u201d \u201c[t]he right \u2026 to receive notice before the \nroom or roommate of the resident in the facility is \nchanged,\u201d \u201c[t]he right to voice grievances,\u201d \u201c[t]he right \nof the resident to organize and participate in resident \ngroups,\u201d \u201cthe right of the resident\u2019s family to meet in \nthe facility,\u201d \u201c[t]he right of the resident to participate \nin social, religious, and community activities,\u201d \u201c[t]he \nright to examine\u201d facility survey results, \u201c[t]he right \nto refuse a transfer to another room,\u201d and \u201c[a]ny other \nright established by the Secretary.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \n1396r(c)(1)(A)(i), (iii)-(xi) (emphasis added). FNHRA \nrefers to these as \u201clegal rights.\u201d Id. at (c)(1)(B)(i), (iv). \nThe \u201cpredischarge-notice provision is more of the \nsame.\u201d Talevski, 599 U.S. at 184. \u201cNestled in a para-\ngraph concerning \u2018transfer and discharge rights,\u2019 that \nprovision tells nursing facilities that they \u2018must not \ntransfer or discharge [a] resident\u2019 unless certain \npreconditions are met, including advance notice \u2026 to \nthe resident and his or her family.\u201d Id. at 184\u201385 \n\n25 \n \n(quoting 42 U.S.C. 1396r(c)(2)) (cleaned up); accord id. \nat 192 (Gorsuch, J., concurring) (\u201c[T]he text of the \nAct\u2019s operative provisions refers to individual \n\u2018rights.\u2019\u201d). And before effecting a transfer or discharge, \nFNHRA requires the nursing home to provide a notice \nthat must include \u201cnotice of the resident\u2019s right to \nappeal the transfer or discharge.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \n1396r(c)(2)(B)(i), (iii). \nAs a result, \u201cthe text of the unnecessary-restraint \nand predischarge-notice provisions unambiguously \nconfer[ ] rights upon the residents.\u201d Talevski, 599 U.S. \nat 184. Those provisions \u201cstand in stark contrast to \nthe statutory provisions that failed Gonzaga\u2019s test in \nGonzaga itself.\u201d Id. at 185.  \nConversely, the any-qualified-provider provision \nnever mentions the word \u201cright\u201d or its equivalent. To \nbe sure, the phrase \u201cmay obtain \u2026 assistance\u201d might \nconfer a benefit. But that is not enough under Talev-\nski and Gonzaga. \u201c[I]t is rights, not the broader or \nvaguer \u2018benefits\u2019 or \u2018interests,\u2019 that may be enforced\u201d \nunder Section 1983. Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at 283. \nDriving that point home, FNHRA proves that \nCongress knows how to use clear rights-creating lan-\nguage in a Spending Clause provision when it wants \nto confer the right to choose a healthcare provider. As \nnoted above, in the same subsection that this Court \nanalyzed in Talevski\u2014\u201cRequirements relating to \nresidents\u2019 rights\u201d\u2014Congress required that a \u201cnursing \nfacility must protect and promote the rights of each \nresident, including\u201d the \u201cright[ ]\u201d of \u201cFree choice,\u201d \nstarting with the \u201cright to choose a personal attending \nphysician.\u201d 42 U.S.C. 1396r(c)(1)(A)(i) (emphasis \nadded). \n\n26 \n \nThe text and structure of the any-qualified-\nprovider provision contain no such rights-creating \nlanguage. And Congress\u2019s \u201cuse of explicit language in \nother statutes cautions against inferring\u201d Congress \nintended to say something it didn\u2019t say in the statute \nunder consideration. Marx v. Gen. Revenue Corp., 568 \nU.S. 371, 384 (2013). If that\u2019s true where \u201cexplicit \nlanguage\u201d is not required, ibid., then in a context like \nthis one, where explicit rights-creating language is \nrequired, the absence of that language\u2014coupled with \nits presence in statutes like FNHRA\u2014is dispositive. \nSee Sandoval, 532 U.S. at 288 (\u201cWe therefore begin \n(and find that we can end) our search for Congress\u2019s \nintent with the text and structure of Title VI.\u201d). \n2. Titles VI and IX prove Congress can \nclearly confer a private right by \nusing text from the rights-creating \nprovisions of the U.S. Constitution. \nThe two rights-creating provisions this Court \nidentified in Gonzaga\u2014Title VI and Title IX\u2014confirm \nCongress knows how to use clear rights-creating lan-\nguage. As Gonzaga recognized, both contain \u201cexplicit\u201d \nrights-creating terms. 536 U.S. at 284 n.3. \u201cTitle VI \nprovides: \u2018No person in the United States shall ... be \nsubjected to discrimination under any program or \nactivity receiving Federal financial assistance\u2019 on the \nbasis of race, color, or national origin.\u201d Ibid. (quoting \n42 U.S.C. 2000d) (emphasis added in Gonzaga). And \n\u201cTitle IX provides: \u2018No person in the United \nStates shall, on the basis of sex, ... be subjected to dis-\ncrimination under any education program or activity \nreceiving Federal financial assistance.\u2019\u201d Ibid. (quoting \n20 U.S.C. 1681(a)) (emphasis added in Gonzaga). \n\n27 \n \nThis Court\u2019s conclusion that the phrase \u201cNo \nperson shall,\u201d located in two civil-rights statutes, \nqualifies as clear rights-creating language follows \nnaturally from the phrase\u2019s deeply rooted, rights-\ncreating pedigree. The U.S. Constitution\u2019s Bill of \nRights and analogous provisions in nearly all the \nstates\u2019 constitutions have included that phrase for \ncenturies. See U.S. Const. amend. V (\u201cNo person shall \n\u2026\u201d); John T. McNaughton, The Privilege against Self-\nIncrimination, 51 J. Crim. L. Criminology & Police \nSci. 138, 139 (1960) (noting that \u201cthe constitutions of \nall but two states\u201d contain verbatim \u201cNo person shall\u201d \nlanguage or its equivalent).  \nBy contrast, the any-qualified-provider provision \ncontains no such clear rights-creating language. \nAlthough the court below thought the phrase \u201cany \nindividual\u201d \u201cclosely mirrors\u201d the \u201cNo person \u2026 shall\u201d \nphrasing highlighted in Gonzaga, Pet.App.57a, that \nconclusion is fatally flawed.  \nCongress could have drawn on the rights-creating \npedigree of the phrase \u201cNo person shall\u201d and required \nstate plans to provide that \u201cno person shall be denied \nthe free choice of any provider qualified to perform the \nrequired services.\u201d But Congress did not write that. \nInstead, it used \u201cmay\u201d in place of the more traditional \nrights-creating \u201cshall,\u201d it limited the scope of the class \nto \u201celigible\u201d individuals, it gave states authority to \ndecide what makes a provider \u201cqualified,\u201d and it spoke \nof \u201cobtain[ing]\u201d a benefit from a third party. \nDespite all this, Respondents have argued that \nthe any-qualified-provider provision should be read as \nthough it were written like Titles VI and IX, but this \nCourt usually does not \u201cread into statutes words that \n\n28 \n \naren\u2019t there.\u201d Romag Fasteners, Inc v. Fossil, Inc., 590 \nU.S. 212, 215 (2020). Accord Morse v. Republican \nParty of Va., 517 U.S. 186, 286\u201388 (1996) (Thomas, J., \ndissenting, joined by Rehnquist, C.J., Scalia, J., and \nin relevant part, Kennedy, J.) (concluding, pre-\nGonzaga, that Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act \ncontained a private right of action but Section 10 did \nnot because only the former used the familiar \u201cno \nperson shall\u201d term of art). \nNor can Respondents transform the any-\nqualified-provider provision into a \u201cfree-choice-of-\nprovider provision\u201d simply by attaching that label to \nit. Contra Opp.i (adopting this label and inserting it \ninto the first question presented). The provision\u2019s text \ndoes not contain the phrase \u201cfree choice,\u201d much less \nthe clear rights-creating language in Titles VI and IX. \nStretching the text, Respondents try to \u201cconjure up a \nprivate [right] that has not been authorized by \nCongress.\u201d Sandoval, 532 U.S. at 291. But the \nabsence of \u201cclear rights-creating language\u201d calls the \nCourt to reject that effort. Talevski, 599 U.S. at 186. \n3. Absent such explicit rights-creating \nlanguage, spending statutes do not \ncreate private rights, as this Court\u2019s \nprecedents prove.  \nIn Gonzaga, a student sued his private university \nunder Section 1983 to enforce provisions in FERPA \n\u201cprohibit[ing] the federal funding of educational insti-\ntutions that [had] a policy or practice of releasing \neducation records to unauthorized persons.\u201d Gonzaga, \n536 U.S. at 276. One provision stated: \n\n29 \n \nNo funds shall be made available under any \napplicable program to any educational agency \nor institution which has a policy or practice of \npermitting the release of education records (or \npersonally identifiable information contained \ntherein \u2026) of students without the written \nconsent of their parents to any individual, \nagency, or organization.  \nId. at 279 (quoting 20 U.S.C. 1232g(b)(1)). \nA second added that \u201c[n]o funds shall be made \navailable\u201d to educational entities with \u201ca policy or \npractice of releasing, or providing access to, [certain] \npersonally identifiable information \u2026 unless\u2014there is \nwritten consent from the student\u2019s parents \u2026 with a \ncopy of the records to be released to the student\u2019s \nparents and the student if desired by the parents\u201d or a \ncourt order approving the release.\u201d 20 U.S.C. \n1232g(b)(2) (emphasis added). \nThe \nGonzaga \ndissent \nthought \nthe \nsecond \nprovision \u201cplainly [met] the standards\u201d this Court \n\u201carticulated in Blessing for establishing a federal \nright.\u201d Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at 295 (Stevens, J., dissent-\ning). It was \u201cdirected to the benefit of individual \nstudents and parents,\u201d it was \u201cbinding on States,\u201d it \nwas \u201ccouched in mandatory, rather than precatory, \nterms,\u201d it was \u201cfar from vague and amorphous,\u201d and \nit spoke \u201cof the individual \u2018student,\u2019 not students \ngenerally.\u201d Ibid. (cleaned up). The dissent also high-\nlighted the \u201crights-creating language in the title\u201d of \nFERPA\u2014the Family Educational Rights and Privacy \nAct\u2014the \u201ctext of the Act,\u201d and its \u201coverall context.\u201d Id. \nat 293, 296. \n\n30 \n \nDespite all that, this Court held it was not \nenough. The provisions \u201clack[ed] the sort of \u2018rights-\ncreating\u2019 language critical to showing the requisite \ncongressional intent to create new rights.\u201d Id. at 287. \nInstead, the Act spoke \u201conly to the Secretary of \nEducation, directing that \u2018[n]o funds shall be made \navailable\u2019 to any \u2018educational agency or institution\u2019\u201d \nwith \u201ca prohibited \u2018policy or practice.\u2019\u201d Ibid. (quoting \n20 U.S.C. 1232g(b)(1)). And that made the Act\u2019s \u201cfocus \n\u2026 two steps removed from the interests of individual \nstudents and parents.\u201d Ibid. \nRespondents\u2019 arguments here sound like the Gon-\nzaga dissent. Though the any-qualified-provider \nprovision is a directive and uses the word \u201cindivid-\nual,\u201d the text lacks \u201c\u2018rights-creating\u2019 language,\u201d and \nspeaks only to the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices. \nCompare \nibid. \nThat \nmakes \nSection \n1395a(a)(23) two steps removed from the interests of \nbeneficiaries. Ibid. \n\u201cThe Court consistently has found that Congress \nintended to create a cause of action \u2018where the \nlanguage of the statute explicitly confers a right \ndirectly on a class of persons that includes the \nplaintiff in the case.\u2019\u201d Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & \nSmith, Inc. v. Curran, 456 U.S. 353, 391 n.91 (1982) \n(emphasis added) (cleaned up) (quoting Cannon, 441 \nU.S. at 690 n.13). Conversely, it has noted that there \n\u201cwould be far less reason to infer a private remedy in \nfavor of individual persons\u201d where Congress, rather \nthan drafting the legislation \u201cwith an unmistakable \nfocus on the benefited class,\u201d has framed the statute \nsimply as a general prohibition or a command to a \nfederal agency. Coutu, 450 U.S. at 771\u201373 (citing \nCannon, 441 U.S. at 690\u201392 & n.13). \n\n31 \n \nSimilarly, in Coutu, the Court addressed the \nprivate enforceability of minimum-wage provisions in \nthe Davis-Bacon Act that are analogous to the any-\nqualified-provider provision. 450 U.S. at 756\u201357. The \nlead provisions there required that advertised specifi-\ncations for certain federal construction contracts \n\u201cshall contain a provision stating the minimum wages \nto be paid various classes of laborers and mechanics \nwhich shall be based\u201d on the prevailing rates for lab-\norers and mechanics working on similar projects. Id. \nat 756\u201357 (quoting what are now located at 40 U.S.C. \n3142(a) and (b)) (emphasis added). A separate pro-\nvision added that \u201c[e]very contract based upon these \nspecifications must contain a stipulation that the \ncontractor shall pay wages not less than those stated \nin the specifications.\u201d Id. at 757 (emphasis added) \n(describing what is now located at 40 U.S.C. 3142(c)). \nThis Court had previously \u201crecognized that on its \nface, the Act is a minimum wage law designed for the \nbenefit of construction workers.\u201d Id. at 771 (cleaned \nup). But that \u201cdesign[ ]\u201d did \u201cnot end the inquiry.\u201d \nIbid. Instead, the Court asked \u201cwhether the language \nof the statute indicates that Congress intended that it \nbe enforced through private litigation.\u201d Ibid. That \nintent exists only \u201c\u2018where the language of the statute \nexplicitly confer[s] a right directly on a class of persons \nthat include[s] the plaintiff.\u201d Id. at 772 (emphasis \nadded) (quoting Cannon, 441 U.S. at 690 n.13). \n\u201cConversely,\u201d no private cause of action arises \nwhen Congress \u201cframe[s] the statute simply as a gen-\neral prohibition or a command to a federal agency.\u201d \nIbid. (quoting Cannon, 441 U.S. at 690\u201392). And \nthat\u2019s what Congress did in \u201cSection 1 of the Davis-\nBacon Act,\u201d which required \u201ccertain stipulations be \n\n32 \n \nplaced in federal construction contracts for the benefit \nof mechanics and laborers, but [did] not confer rights \ndirectly on those individuals.\u201d Ibid. Given that \nomission, the Act\u2019s language \u201cprovide[d] no support \nfor the implication of a private remedy.\u201d Id. at 773. \nSo too here. Congress directed the Secretary to \n\u201capprove any plan which fulfills the conditions\u201d in \n1396a(a), including that a \u201cState plan for medical \nassistance must \u2026 provide that \u2026 any individual \neligible for medical assistance \u2026 may obtain such \nassistance from any \u2026 qualified\u201d provider. 42 U.S.C. \n1396a(b), (a)(23). That condition may have been \n\u201cdesigned to benefit a particular class,\u201d like the Davis-\nBacon Act was designed to benefit mechanics and \nlaborers, but that \u201cdoes not end the inquiry.\u201d Coutu, \n450 U.S. at 771. It also may have been stated as a \nmandatory component, like the Davis-Bacon Act was. \nId. at 757 (describing stipulations that contracts \n\u201cmust contain\u201d). But as Coutu proves, that is not \nenough to create a privately enforceable right where, \nas here, a statute is framed \u201csimply as \u2026 a command \nto a federal agency\u201d and does not \u201c\u2018explicitly confer[ ] \na right directly on a class of persons that include[s] \nthe plaintiff in the case.\u2019\u201d Id. at 772 (quoting Cannon, \n441 U.S. at 690 n.13). \nUltimately, the question is \u201cone of congressional \nintent, not one of whether this Court thinks it can \nimprove upon the statutory scheme that Congress \nenacted into law.\u201d Id. at 770 (cleaned up). As for the \nany-qualified-provider provision\u2019s text, Congress\u2019s \nintent is clear: The \u201crights-creating language so \ncritical to the Court\u2019s analysis\u201d in its cases \u201cis \ncompletely absent\u201d here. Sandoval, 532 U.S. at 288 \n(cleaned up). And that ends the analysis. Ibid. \n\n33 \n \nD. The Medicaid Act\u2019s broader statutory \nregime reinforces that the any-qualified-\nprovider provision does not create \nprivate rights. \nThe Medicaid Act\u2019s broader statutory scheme \nconfirms what the any-qualified-provider provision\u2019s \ntext has already shown\u2014that the provision does not \ncreate privately enforceable rights. \nThe Medicaid Act is not a civil-rights statute that \nimposes duties and restraints on states. It is merely a \nfunding mechanism, and state \u201cparticipation in the \nMedicaid program is entirely optional.\u201d Harris v. \nMcRae, 448 U.S. 297, 301 (1980). States that choose \nto participate in Medicaid may also choose to change \ntheir programs, even if doing so creates the possibility \nthat the Secretary will deny funding. 42 U.S.C. 1396c; \n42 C.F.R. 430.12(c). \nThe Act\u2019s baseline requirement for states is \nproviding coverage to \u201ccategorically needy\u201d groups for \nsome basic services. Barbara S. Klees et al., Ctrs. for \nMedicare & Medicaid Servs., Brief Summaries of \nMedicare & Medicaid: Title XVIII & Title XIX of The \nSocial Securities Act 22\u201326 (Dec. 31, 2012). Beyond \nthat, states can choose how they want to structure \ntheir programs when it comes to eligibility standards, \nscope of coverage, payment methodology, and the like. \nId. at 22\u201328. The Secretary alone decides if a state \nhas satisfied the Act\u2019s requirements and, if the state \nlater falls out of compliance in administering its plan, \nwhether to withhold some or all of the state\u2019s funding. \n42 U.S.C. 1396c; 42 C.F.R. 430.12(c). \n \n\n34 \n \nPut differently, the Act imposes a legally binding \ndirective only on the Secretary, who is charged with \napproving plans and ensuring states substantially \ncomply with the Act\u2019s plan requirements to continue \nreceiving funds. 42 U.S.C. 1396c. Absent a Talevski-\nlike bill of rights, \u201c[f]ocusing on substantial compli-\nance is tantamount to focusing on the aggregate \npractices of a state funding recipient.\u201d Midwest Foster \nCare & Adoption Ass\u2019n v. Kincade, 712 F.3d 1190, \n1201 (8th Cir. 2013). \nLike the FERPA provisions in Gonzaga, then, \nSection 1396a and the any-qualified-provider provi-\nsion are \u201cprimarily directed [at] the Federal Govern-\nment\u2019s \u2018distribution of public funds,\u2019 [with] \u2018an \naggregate, not individual, focus.\u2019\u201d Talevski, 599 U.S. \nat 185\u201386 (quoting Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at 290). The \nSecretary must look at the aggregate of more than 80 \ndisparate plan requirements and assess a state\u2019s sub-\nstantial compliance. \u201cEven where a subsidiary provi-\nsion includes mandatory language that ultimately \nbenefits individuals, a statute phrased as a directive \nto a federal agency typically does not confer enforce-\nable federal rights on the individuals.\u201d Gillespie, 867 \nF.3d at 1041 (citing Coutu, 450 U.S. at 756 n.1). \nJust as the Medicaid Act charges the Secretary of \nHealth and Human Services with dealing with state \nviolations, Congress in FERPA explicitly authorized \nthe Secretary of Education to \u201cdeal with violations\u201d of \nthat Act. Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at 289 (quoting 20 U.S.C. \n1232g(f)). And there was \u201cno question that FERPA\u2019s \nnondisclosure provisions fail[ed] to confer enforceable \nrights.\u201d Id. at 287. There is likewise no question that \nthe any-qualified-provider provision fails to confer an \nenforceable right here. \n\n35 \n \nThe plurality\u2019s analysis in Armstrong bolsters \nthat conclusion. 575 U.S. at 331\u201332 (Scalia, J., joined \nby Roberts, C.J., Thomas, J., and Alito, J.). Its opinion \nanalyzed 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(30)\u2014a subsection of the \nMedicaid Act parallel to the any-qualified-provider \nprovision\u2014and noted that it is \u201cphrased as a directive \nto the federal agency charged with approving state \nMedicaid plans, not as a conferral of the right to sue \nupon the beneficiaries of the State\u2019s decision to partic-\nipate in Medicaid.\u201d Id. at 331. \u201c[S]uch language re-\nveals no congressional intent to create a private right \nof action.\u201d Ibid. (cleaned up). The same is true here. \nIn this case, the Fourth Circuit placed great \nweight on 42 U.S.C. 1320a-2 in dismissing any \nrelevance of the any-qualified-provider provision\u2019s \nappearance in a statute \u201crequiring a State plan or \nspecifying the required contents of a State plan.\u201d \nPet.App.29a (quoting 42 U.S.C. 1320a-2). But as the \nEighth Circuit has explained, Section 1320a-2 simply \nmeans that a provision \u201ccannot be deemed indivi-\ndually unenforceable solely because of its situs in a \nlarger regime \u2018requiring a State plan or specifying the \nrequired contents of a state plan.\u2019\u201d Midwest Foster \nCare, 712 F.3d at 1200 (emphasis added). And \u201cwhen \na statute links funding to substantial compliance with \nits conditions\u2014including forming and adhering to a \nstate plan with specified features\u2014this [link] \ncounsels against the creation of individually enforce-\nable rights.\u201d Ibid. That\u2019s \u201cbecause, even where a state \nsubstantially complies with its federal responsibili-\nties, a sizeable minority of its beneficiaries may none-\ntheless fail to receive the full panoply of offered \nbenefits.\u201d Id. at 1200\u201301. True rights-creating provi-\nsions require more than this. \n\n36 \n \nTellingly, the Armstrong plurality did not think \nSection 1320a-2 foreclosed its consideration of this \ncritical statutory context. See Kauffman, 981 F.3d at \n376 (Elrod, J., concurring, joined by six other judges) \n(explaining that Section 1320a-2 \u201cdid not inform the \nanalysis\u201d in Armstrong). Neither should this Court.  \nStanding alone, the Medicaid Act\u2019s substantial \ncompliance regime, its directive to the Secretary, or \nits articulation of dozens of plan requirements might \nnot be enough to foreclose private enforceability. See \nArmstrong, 575 U.S. at 328 (making that point \nregarding the Secretary\u2019s ability to withhold funds). \nBut taken together, they confirm what the text \nestablishes\u2014that Congress chose not to confer a \nprivately enforceable right in the any-qualified-\nprovider provision. \nE. Common sense confirms what text and \nstructure prove. \n1. Respondents\u2019 approach would drop \nTalevski\u2019s high bar to the floor.  \nIn their opposition brief, Respondents argued that \nthe any-qualified-provider provision \u201chas an \u2018unmis-\ntakable focus\u2019 on the benefited class and is \u2018phrased in \nterms of the persons benefited,\u2019\u201d which, Respondents \nclaimed, \u201c\u2018satisfie[s]\u2019 this Court\u2019s test for whether a \nstatute contains the necessary rights-creating lan-\nguage.\u201d Opp.16 (quoting Talevski, 599 U.S. at 183). \nSuch a reading of Talevski would drop Gonzaga\u2019s \u201cde-\nmanding bar\u201d to the floor. Talevski, 599 U.S. at 180. \n \n\n37 \n \nA statute that \u201caddresses,\u201d Opp.16, a benefited \nclass still must contain clear rights-creating language \nto confer privately enforceable rights. Per Gonzaga, \n\u201crights-creating\u201d language is \u201ccritical to showing the \nrequisite congressional intent to create new rights.\u201d \n536 U.S. at 287 (emphasis added); accord Sandoval, \n532 U.S. at 288 (same). Focus on a benefited class is \nnecessary\u2014but not sufficient. \nConsider the implications of finding privately \nenforceable rights simply because a statute \u201cadd-\nresses whether \u2018individual\u2019 Medicaid patients \u2018may \nobtain\u2019\u201d a benefit. Opp.16. Leaving aside that Section \n1396a(a) uses the word \u201cindividual\u201d hundreds of \ntimes, eight of the 87 listed plan-requirement provi-\nsions contain individual-focused, benefit-conferring \nlanguage that likely would satisfy Respondents\u2019 lax \ntest. Those provisions say that a \u201cState plan for \nmedical assistance must\u201d do the following: \n(3)  \u201cprovide for granting an opportunity for a fair \nhearing before the State agency to any \nindividual \nwhose \nclaim \nfor \nmedical \nassistance under the plan is denied or is not \nacted upon with reasonable promptness,\u201d \n1396a(a)(3) (emphasis added); \n(8)  \u201cprovide that all individuals wishing to make \napplication for medical assistance under the \nplan shall have opportunity to do so, and that \nsuch assistance shall be furnished with \nreasonable \npromptness \nto \nall \neligible \nindividuals,\u201d 1396a(a)(8) (emphasis added); \n \n\n38 \n \n(10) \u201cprovide\u2014(B) that the medical assistance \nmade available to any individual described \nin subparagraph (A)\u2014(i) shall not be less in \namount, duration, or scope than the medical \nassistance made available to any other such \nindividual, and (ii) shall not be less in \namount, duration, or scope than the medical \nassistance made available to individuals not \ndescribed \nin \nsubparagraph \n(A),\u201d \n1396a(a)(10)(B) (emphasis added); \n       \u201cprovide\u2014(D) for the inclusion of home health \nservices for any individual who, under the \nState plan, is entitled to nursing facility \nservices,\u201d 1396a(a)(10)(D) (emphasis added); \n(12) \u201cprovide that, in determining whether an \nindividual is blind, there shall be an \nexamination by a physician skilled in the \ndiseases of the eye or by an optometrist, \nwhichever \nthe \nindividual \nmay \nselect,\u201d \n1396a(a)(12) (emphasis added); \n(32) \u201cprovide that no payment under the plan for \nany care or service provided to an individual \nshall be made to anyone other than such \nindividual or the person or institution \nproviding such care or service,\u201d barring \ncertain exceptions, 1396a(a)(32) (emphasis \nadded); \n(34) \u201cprovide that in the case of any individual \nwho has been determined to be eligible for \nmedical assistance under the plan, such \nassistance will be made available to him for \ncare and services included under the plan \nand furnished in or after the third month \n\n39 \n \nbefore the month in which he made \napplication (or application was made on his \nbehalf in the case of a deceased individual) \nfor such assistance if such individual was (or \nupon application would have been) eligible \nfor such assistance at the time such care and \nservices \nwere \nfurnished,\u201d \n1396a(a)(34) \n(emphasis added); \n(53) \u201cprovide\u2014(A) for notifying in a timely \nmanner all individuals in the State who are \ndetermined to be eligible for medical \nassistance and who are pregnant women, \nbreastfeeding or postpartum women \u2026, or \nchildren below the age of 5, of the availability \nof benefits furnished by the special supple-\nmental \nnutrition \nprogram \nunder \nsuch \nsection,\u201d 1396a(a)(53)(A) (emphasis added); \nand \n        \u201c(B) for referring any such individual to the \nState agency responsible for administering \nsuch program,\u201d 1396a(a)(53)(B) (emphasis \nadded); \n(84) \u201cprovide that\u2014(A) the State shall not \nterminate eligibility for medical assistance \nunder the State plan \u2026 for an individual who \nis an eligible juvenile \u2026 because the juvenile \nis an inmate of a public institution \u2026,\u201d \n1396a(a)(84)(A) (emphasis added); \n        \u201c(B) in the case of an individual who is an \neligible juvenile \u2026, the State shall, prior to \nthe individual\u2019s release from such a public \ninstitution, conduct a redetermination of \neligibility for such individual with respect to \n\n40 \n \nsuch medical assistance \u2026 and, if the State \ndetermines \u2026 that the individual continues \nto meet the eligibility requirements for such \nmedical assistance, the State shall restore \ncoverage for such medical assistance to such \nan individual upon the individual\u2019s release \nfrom such public institution,\u201d 1396a(a)(84)(B) \n(emphasis added).4 \nEach of these requirements \u201caddresses whether \n\u2018individual\u2019 Medicaid patients,\u201d Opp.16, \u201cshall\u201d or \n\u201cwill\u201d be given various types of medical assistance, \nproviders, or processes to ensure timely and equal \naccess to that assistance. Given Gonzaga\u2019s \u201cdemand-\ning bar,\u201d Talevski, 599 U.S. at 180, it can\u2019t be true that \nall of them create privately enforceable rights. If it \nwere, then Talevski was hardly the \u201catypical case,\u201d id. \nat 183, and lower courts are free to \u201cfind\u201d private \nrights in innumerable federal statutory provisions. \nWorse, accepting Respondents\u2019 position that a \nprovision\u2019s \u201c\u2018unmistakable focus\u2019 on the benefited \nclass\u201d and its \u201c\u2018phras[ing] in terms of the persons \nbenefited\u2019\u201d is enough to create a private right, Opp.16 \n(cleaned up), would require overruling Suter v. Artist \nM., in its entirety. 503 U.S. 347 (1992). That is exactly \nwhat Congress insisted it was not doing when it \npassed Section 1320a-2. 42 U.S.C. 1320a-2 (providing \n\u201cthat this section is not intended to alter the holding \nin Suter v. Artist M. that section 671(a)(15) of this \ntitle is not enforceable in a private right of action\u201d). \n \n4 Accord 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(84)(C), (D) (requiring similar pro-\ncessing of applications for medical assistance submitted by \u201can \nindividual who is an eligible juvenile\u201d described in separate \nsubsections). \n\n41 \n \nThe Adoption Act plan-requirement provision in \nSuter required states to specify that, \u201cin each case, \nreasonable efforts will be made (A) prior to the \nplacement of a child in foster care, to prevent or \neliminate the need for removal of the child from his \nhome, and (B) to make it possible for the child to \nreturn to his home.\u201d Suter, 503 U.S. at 351 (quoting \n42 U.S.C. 671(a)(15)) (emphasis added). And yet, the \nCourt held that provision did not \u201cconfer[ ] an enforce-\nable private right on its beneficiaries\u201d even though it \nconferred a benefit and identified the benefited \nindividuals (\u201ca child\u201d and \u201cthe child\u201d in foster care). \nId. at 364. A \u201creasonable efforts\u201d requirement\u2014like a \nstate\u2019s substantial-compliance requirement to allow \nMedicaid recipients to choose a qualified provider\u2014\n\u201cis at least as plausibly read to impose only a rather \ngeneralized duty on the State, to be enforced not by \nprivate individuals, but by the Secretary.\u201d Id. at 363. \nIn recent decades, this Court has reined in the \n\u201cready implication\u201d of privately enforceable rights. \nArmstrong, 575 U.S. at 330 n.*. It should not return \nto \u201cthe heady days in which [it] assumed common-law \npowers to create causes of action.\u201d Corr. Servs. Corp. \nv. Malesko, 534 U.S. 61, 75 (2001) (Scalia J., \nconcurring). Accepting that invitation would subject \nstates to countless suits under a myriad of federal \nstatutes\u2014all without congressional approval. \n2. Finding a private right in the any-\nqualified-provider provision creates \ncontradictions and problems.  \nAdditional practical reasons weigh strongly \nagainst finding a private right in the any-qualified-\nprovider provision. \n\n42 \n \nFirst, Respondents\u2019 position steals the discretion \nthat Congress vested in the Secretary through the \nsubstantial-compliance statute. Under the Medicaid \nAct, the Secretary is charged with interpretation and \nenforcement, including deciding whether a state\u2019s \nadministration of its plan is substantially compliant \nin its treatment of \u201cqualified\u201d providers. Yet under \nRespondents\u2019 theory, that administrative discretion is \nreassigned to federal district courts across the \ncountry issuing injunctions in Section 1983 actions.  \nSecond, a provider has a remedy for exclusion. It \ncan file an administrative appeal followed by state-\ncourt review and, if necessary, review by this Court. \n42 U.S.C. 1396a(kk)(8)(B)(ii); 42 C.F.R. 1002.213; S.C. \nCode Regs. 126\u2013150, 126\u2013152, 126\u2013154; S.C. Code \nAnn. \u00a7 1-23-380. Providers may balk at having to \npursue an administrative remedy. But no one is \ncontending that state-court review followed by a \npetition for certiorari is an inadequate backstop. \nWhat\u2019s more, to suggest that Congress also \nintended beneficiaries to have a simultaneous right to \nsue in federal court to challenge such a decision is, to \nsay the least, \u201ca curious system for review of a State\u2019s \ndetermination that a Medicaid provider is not \n\u2018qualified.\u2019\u201d Gillespie, 867 F.3d at 1041\u201342. And \nbecause there\u2019s no reason that a judicial affirmance of \na disqualification decision would have preclusive ef-\nfect on a beneficiary\u2019s federal claim, this \u201cgives \u2026 \nfurther reason to doubt that Congress \u2026 unambigu-\nously created an enforceable federal right\u201d here. Ibid. \nRelatedly, it makes sense to infer a private right \nin the FNHRA context, where the resident and his \nnursing home may have adverse interests. See \n\n43 \n \nTalevski, 599 U.S. at 172\u201374. It makes far less sense \nhere, where the beneficiary is protected by the \nprovider\u2019s exercise of its appeal rights. That may \nexplain why FNHRA has a savings clause, 42 U.S.C. \n1396r(h)(8), while Section 1396a does not. \nThird, a ruling for Respondents would clash with \nthe Medicaid Act\u2019s requirement that a state plan \n\u201cprovide \u2026 an opportunity for a fair hearing before \nthe State agency to any individual whose claim for \nmedical assistance under the plan is denied.\u201d 42 \nU.S.C. 1396a(a)(3). It would be strange for Congress \nto create an express administrative remedy for bene-\nficiaries to challenge their own eligibility while \nauthorizing those beneficiaries sub silentio to go to \nfederal court to challenge a provider\u2019s eligibility.  \nFourth, Respondents say that Medicaid benefi-\nciaries need a private right of action to preserve broad \naccess to healthcare. But nothing is further from the \ntruth. South Carolinians in the Medicaid program \nhave access to plenty of providers. See supra, pp. 9\u2013\n11. And any excluded providers have an administra-\ntive remedy and judicial review to preserve their par-\nticipation in the program.  \nFinally, accepting Respondents\u2019 position would \nsubject states to innumerable lawsuits and accom-\npanying attorney-fee awards\u2014all without the clear \nnotice that the Spending Clause requires. And that \nproblem is not limited to the any-qualified-provider \nprovision. Lower courts that fail to follow this Court\u2019s \nguidance have found a vast array of private rights \nenforceable under Section 1983. \n \n\n44 \n \nLimiting the survey just to 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a), \nthese lawsuits have included healthcare providers \nchallenging a state\u2019s notice-and-comment process for \nsetting payment rates, e.g., BT Bourbonnais Care, \nLLC v. Norwood, 866 F.3d 815, 824 (7th Cir. 2017) \n(applying 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(13)(A)); individuals \ncontesting how promptly they received medical \nassistance, e.g., Doe v. Kidd, 501 F.3d 348, 355\u201357 \n(4th Cir. 2007) (applying 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(8)); and \nbeneficiaries challenging eligibility decisions, e.g., \nBontrager v. Ind. Fam. & Soc. Servs. Admin., 697 \nF.3d 604, 606\u201307 (7th Cir. 2012) (applying 42 U.S.C. \n1396a(a)(10)). The cost of these federal lawsuits is not \neasily quantified. But there is no doubt that such \nlawsuits will drain state Medicaid coffers at the \nexpense of needy families and children\u2014harming the \nvery people the Medicaid Act is supposed to help. \nIn sum, the any-qualified-provider provision lacks \nthe kind of unambiguous rights-creating language \nthat this Court demands to recognize a private right \nenforceable by Section 1983. The Medicaid Act\u2019s \nstructure counsels strongly against recognizing a \nprivate right. And the practical ramifications of \nfinding a private right in Section 1396a(a)(23) are so \ndisconcerting and irrational that the Court should not \nimpute them to Congress. \n \n \n\n45 \n \nII. The Court need not overrule any cases, but \nit should clarify that it has abandoned Bless-\ning\u2019s factors and cabined Wilder and Wright. \nThe Court in Gonzaga and Talevski emphasized \nthe clear-rights-creating-language requirement to \nensure that lower courts do not loosely imply private \nrights enforceable through Section 1983. Yet despite \nthis Court\u2019s best efforts, lower courts have been slow \nto implement these instructions. As the decision \nbelow proves, \u201ceven after\u201d Talevski, some lower courts \nstill feel they \u201clack the guidance inferior judges need.\u201d \nPet.App.35a\u201336a (Richardson, J., concurring in the \njudgment). So the Court should provide it now. \nBlessing, Wilder, and Wright continue to sow \nconfusion, as Judge Richardson\u2019s concurrences prove. \nPet.App.35a\u201336a, 65a, 120a\u201325a. In Wilder, the \nCourt looked \u201cbeyond the unambiguous terms of the \nstatute\u201d \nand \nrelied \non \n\u201cpolicy \nconsiderations \npurportedly derived from legislative history and \nsuperseded versions of the statute\u201d to find a privately \nenforceable right. 496 U.S. at 528 (Rehnquist, C.J., \ndissenting). Blessing reached a different result, but it \nis remembered more for its distillation of \u201cthree \nfactors,\u201d 520 U.S. at 340, from Wilder and Wright. \nCourts and litigants alike have unfortunately read all \nthree cases as \u201cestablish[ing] a relatively loose \nstandard for finding rights enforceable by \u00a7 1983.\u201d \nGonzaga, 536 U.S. at 282.  \nAttempting to set the record straight, Gonzaga \ndisavowed any reading of Blessing, Wilder, and \nWright that might \u201csuggest that something less than \nan unambiguously conferred right is enforceable by \n\u00a7 1983.\u201d Ibid. And in assessing whether FERPA\u2019s \n\n46 \n \nprovisions created privately enforceable rights, the \nCourt did not apply the Blessing factors. Id. at 287\u2013\n90. In fact, when Justice Stevens argued in dissent \nthat separation of powers would be better served by \nthe Blessing test, id. at 300\u201302 (Stevens, J., dissent-\ning), the majority countered that it \u201cfail[ed] to see how \nrelations between the branches are served by having \ncourts apply a multifactor balancing test to pick and \nchoose which federal requirements may be enforced \nby \u00a7 1983 and which may not,\u201d id. at 286. \nTurning to Wilder and Wright, the Gonzaga Court \nnoted that in both cases, Congress had \u201cexplicitly \nconferred specific monetary entitlements upon the \nplaintiffs.\u201d Id. at 280. In contrast, the student \nplaintiff \u2019s attempt to find a federally enforceable right \nin FERPA was \u201ca far cry from the sort of individu-\nalized, concrete monetary entitlement found enforce-\nable\u201d in Wilder and Wright. Id. at 288 n.6. Years later, \nthe Armstrong majority took specific aim at Wilder, \nobserving that \u201clater opinions\u201d like Gonzaga \u201cplainly \nrepudiate the ready implication of a \u00a7 1983 action \nthat Wilder exemplified.\u201d 575 U.S. at 330 n.*. \nMore recently, this Court\u2019s decision in Talevski \nreaffirmed Gonzaga\u2019s analysis. All nine Justices \njoined opinions confirming that Gonzaga establishes \nthe \u201ctest for determining whether a particular federal \nlaw actually secures rights for \u00a7 1983 purposes.\u201d \nTalevski, 599 U.S. at 175; id. at 183 (\u201cGonzaga sets \nforth our established method for ascertaining \nunambiguous conferral.\u201d); id. at 193 (Barrett, J., \nconcurring) \n(\u201cGonzaga \nsets \nthe \nstandard \nfor \ndetermining when a Spending Clause statute confers \nindividual rights\u201d); id. at 230 (Alito, J., dissenting) \n(Gonzaga sets forth the Court\u2019s \u201cestablished method\u201d) \n\n47 \n \n(cleaned up). And all nine Justices agreed Gonzaga\u2019s \nunambiguous-conferral test sets a \u201chigh\u201d and \n\u201cdemanding bar.\u201d Id. at 180; id. at 184 (\u201csignificant \nhurdle\u201d); id. at 193 (Barrett, J., concurring) (\u201cThis bar \nis high\u201d); id. at 230 (Alito, J., dissenting) (agreeing \n\u201cwith the Court\u2019s understanding of the high bar\u201d). \nDespite that unanimity, the Court left some \nthings unsaid. And the Fourth Circuit used that \nsilence to double down on its prior opinions after \nTalevski. Pet.App.12a\u201313a. \nFirst, while Talevski did not apply the Blessing \nfactors, it did not overrule Blessing or expressly \ndisavow its test.5 So on remand, the Fourth Circuit \nreasoned that while Talevski had \u201cshed some new \nlight on Blessing,\u201d it was not for the court \u201cto proclaim \na Supreme Court precedent [had been] overthrown.\u201d \nPet.App.21a\u201322a. The court expected at least \u201csome \ndiscussion of Blessing had it been jettisoned,\u201d so it felt \nthat it \u201cremain[ed] bound by Blessing until given \nexplicit instructions to the contrary\u2014instructions \nthat have yet to come.\u201d Ibid. \nSecond, although Talevski did not cite Wright or \nWilder, it didn\u2019t overrule them either. So the Fourth \nCircuit\u2019s most recent decision continued to rely on \nWilder. In the court\u2019s view, Wilder had \u201calready held \nthat a different funding condition\u201d in Section 1396a(a) \n\u201cconfers individual rights enforceable via\u201d Section \n \n5 But see The Supreme Court 2022 Term, 42 U.S.C. 1983 \u2013 \nSpending Clause \u2013 Health & Hospital Corp. of Marion County v. \nTalevski, 137 Harv. L. Rev. 380, 388 (2023) (observing that the \nTalevski \u201cmajority affirmed the Seventh Circuit while silently \nabandoning the very test the Seventh Circuit believed \ngoverned,\u201d namely Blessing\u2019s three-factored test). \n\n48 \n \n1983. Pet.App.27a. So the Fourth Circuit thought that \nWilder \u201cappear[ed] to doom the State\u2019s argument\u201d \nthat the any-qualified-provider provision is not \nprivately enforceable because it focuses on govern-\nment officials overseeing funding. Ibid. And the court \ndid not believe that the Armstrong majority had effec-\ntively overruled Wilder, insisting instead that \u201c[t]he \nserious business of spurning a precedent cannot be \nprecipitated by winks and nods.\u201d Pet.App.28a. \nAgainst this backdrop, the Court should make \nclear that it has abandoned the Blessing test that \nsome lower courts still feel bound to apply \u201ceven after\u201d \nTalevski. Pet.App.35a. See, e.g., Saint Anthony Hosp. \nv. Whitehorn, 100 F.4th 767, 779 (7th Cir. 2024) \n(noting that Talevski did not \u201cdisapprove of Blessing\u201d \nand claiming not to \u201csee a fundamental difference \nbetween the Talevski/Gonzaga standard \u2026 and the \nfirst and third Blessing factors\u201d), reh\u2019g granted and \nopinion vacated, No. 21-2325, 2024 WL 3561942 (7th \nCir. July 24, 2024); Fed. L. Enf \u2019t Officers Ass\u2019n v. Att\u2019y \nGen. N.J., 93 F.4th 122, 130 (3d Cir. 2024) (observing \nthat this Court \u201chas not expressly held that the \nBlessing factors are no longer relevant\u201d and applying \nthose factors in a footnote). \nThe Court did something similar in Kennedy v. \nBremerton School District, 597 U.S. 507 (2022). \nThere, the Court clarified \u201cthat the shortcomings \nassociated with [the] ambitious, abstract, and \nahistorical approach to the Establishment Clause\u201d \nadopted in Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U.S. 602 (1971), \nhad become \u201cso apparent\u201d that the Court had \u201clong \nago abandoned Lemon and its endorsement test \noffshoot.\u201d Id. at 534 (cleaned up). \n\n49 \n \nBefore Kennedy, \u201c[t]he Court [had] explained that \nthese tests [had] invited chaos in lower courts, led to \ndiffering results in materially identical cases, and \ncreated a minefield for legislators.\u201d Ibid. (cleaned up). \nAnd more recently, the Court had rejected Lemon-\nbased arguments while, \u201c[i]n place of Lemon and the \nendorsement test,\u201d instructing \u201cthat the Establish-\nment Clause must be interpreted by reference to \nhistorical practices and understandings.\u201d Id. at 535\u2013\n36 (cleaned up). That focus had \u201clong represented the \nrule rather than some exception within the Court\u2019s \nEstablishment Clause jurisprudence.\u201d Id. at 536 \n(cleaned up). And the lower courts had \u201cerred by \nfailing to heed this guidance.\u201d Ibid. \nSo too here. This Court has not applied Blessing\u2019s \nthree factors since Blessing itself. 520 U.S. at 340\u201341. \nAnd even in Blessing, the Court merely said that they \nwere the \u201cthree factors\u201d the Court had \u201ctraditionally \nlooked at \u2026 when determining whether a particular \nstatutory provision gives rise to a federal right.\u201d Id. at \n340. That framing is more descriptive than pre-\nscriptive. And it is no longer an accurate description \nof what this Court considers in this context. \nWhat\u2019s more, in acknowledging the \u201cconfusion\u201d \nand \u201cuncertainty\u201d Blessing has wrought, this Court \nhas rejected Blessing-based arguments, confirming \nthat its cases do not \u201cpermit anything short of an \nunambiguously conferred right to support a cause of \naction brought under \u00a7 1983.\u201d Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at \n282\u201383. Given all this, the Court should clarify, much \nlike it did in Kennedy, that it has \u201clong ago abandoned \n[Blessing] and its [three-factor] test.\u201d Kennedy, 597 \nU.S. at 534. \n\n50 \n \nThe Court also should clarify that Wilder and \nWright are limited to the unique monetary-entitle-\nment-conferring provisions at issue there. Despite \nthis Court saying that its \u201copinions plainly repudiate \nthe ready implication of a \u00a7 1983 action that Wilder \nexemplified,\u201d Armstrong, 575 U.S. at 330 n.*, that was \nnot enough for the court below, Pet.App.27a\u201328a. And \nwhile Gonzaga cabined Wilder and Wright to cases \ninvolving spending provisions that \u201cexplicitly confer[ ] \nspecific monetary entitlements upon the plaintiffs,\u201d \nGonzaga, 536 U.S. at 280, 288 n.6, the court below \nrelied on Wilder anyway, Pet.App.15a\u201316a, 27a.  \nAgain, this Court has done something similar in \nthe Establishment Clause context. Three Terms ago, \nthe Court explained that Locke v. Davey, 540 U.S. 712 \n(2004), \u201ccannot be read beyond its narrow focus on \nvocational religious degrees.\u201d Carson ex rel. O. C. v. \nMakin, 596 U.S. 767, 789 (2022). The Court should \nsimilarly clarify here that Wilder and Wright \u201ccannot \nbe read beyond [their] narrow focus,\u201d ibid., on \u201cthe \nsort of individualized, concrete monetary entitlement \nfound enforceable\u201d in those cases, Gonzaga, 536 U.S. \nat 288 n.6. \nFinally, while the Court need not overrule \nBlessing, Wilder, or Wright to reverse the decision \nbelow, if the Court concludes more is required to guide \nlower courts, the Court should overrule all three. \n\u201cStare decisis is not an inexorable command, and the \nstare decisis considerations most relevant here\u2014the \nquality of the precedent\u2019s reasoning, the workability \nof the rule it established, and reliance on the \ndecision\u2014all weigh in favor of letting [all three \ndecisions] go.\u201d Loper Bright Enters. v. Raimondo, 603 \nU.S. 369, 407 (2024) (cleaned up). \n\n51 \n \n1. On the quality of the reasoning, Talevski \ncommands courts to \u201cemploy traditional tools of statu-\ntory construction to assess whether Congress has \nunambiguously conferred individual rights upon a \nclass of beneficiaries to which the plaintiff belongs.\u201d \n599 U.S. at 183 (cleaned up). But in Blessing, Wilder, \nand Wright, the Court did not use traditional tools of \nstatutory interpretation, nor did it ask whether \nCongress had unambiguously conferred a right. The \nCourt asked mainly whether Congress had imposed a \nmandatory benefit. See Blessing, 520 U.S. at 341 \n(asking whether Congress imposed \u201ca binding \nobligation\u201d); Wilder, 496 U.S. at 509\u201310 (looking only \nfor mandatory benefits); Wright, 479 U.S. at 430\u201331 \n(same). That never should have been enough. See \nWilder, 496 U.S. at 528 (Rehnquist, C.J., dissenting); \nWright, 479 U.S. at 434 (O\u2019Connor, J., dissenting). \n2. This trio of cases has also proven unworkable. \nAs shown by the decision below and the 5\u20132 circuit \nsplit, Wilder and Wright, along with Blessing\u2019s three-\nfactored test, have sown chaos and confusion in the \nlower courts. This Court tried to \u201cresolve [that] \nambiguity\u201d in Gonzaga. 536 U.S. at 278. But it didn\u2019t \nwork. \u201cVirtually all the circuits refused to read \nGonzaga as repudiating Blessing.\u201d The Supreme \nCourt 2022 Term, 137 Harv. L. Rev. at 388 (collecting \ncases). \u201cMany interpreted Gonzaga as merely glossing \nBlessing\u2019s first prong and began applying this \n\u2018Blessing-Gonzaga test\u2019 as controlling law.\u201d Ibid. \n(cleaned up) (collecting cases). Others \u201cread Gonzaga \nas providing merely \u2018principles\u2019 courts should keep \n\u2018firmly in mind\u2019 as they apply the \u2018Blessing test.\u2019\u201d Ibid. \n(quoting N.Y. State Citizens\u2019 Coal. for Child. v. Poole, \n922 F.3d 69, 79 (2d Cir. 2019)). \n\n52 \n \n3. This confusion means \u201carguments for reliance \n\u2026 are misplaced.\u201d S. Dakota v. Wayfair, 585 U.S. 162, \n186 (2018). \u201cThis is especially so because\u201d Congress, \nthe states, and private parties \u201chave been on notice \nfor years regarding this Court\u2019s misgivings\u201d about all \nthree cases. Janus v. Am. Fed\u2019n of State, Cnty., and \nMun. Emps., Council 31, 585 U.S. 878, 927 (2018). \nAlso, Congress repealed the amendment in Wilder \n\u201cand replaced it with narrower language\u201d to give the \nstates more flexibility. Long Term Care Pharmacy All. \nv. Ferguson, 362 F.3d 50, 58 (1st Cir. 2004).  \nIn short, given how badly their \u201cdoctrinal under-\npinnings have \u2026 eroded,\u201d how \u201cunworkable\u201d they\u2019ve \nproved, Kimble v. Marvel Ent., LLC, 576 U.S. 446, \n458\u201359 (2015), and how little reliance exists, the \nCourt would be justified in overruling all three cases. \nIII. Reversal would respect separation of pow-\ners and enable states to better steward \nscarce Medicaid resources. \n\u201cUnder the Constitution\u2019s separation of powers, \nCongress and the President may update the law to \nmeet modern policy priorities and needs.\u201d Arizona v. \nNavajo Nation, 599 U.S. 555, 566 (2023). \u201cBut it is not \nthe Judiciary\u2019s role to update the law.\u201d Ibid. And it is \n\u201cparticularly important that the federal courts not do \nso\u201d in cases involving the allocation of scarce resour-\nces that leave states in a \u201czero-sum situation.\u201d Ibid. \nIn Navajo Nation, that resource was \u201cwater in the \narid regions of the American West.\u201d Ibid. Here, it\u2019s \nMedicaid dollars. \u201cAnd the zero-sum reality\u201d of both \n\u201cunderscores that courts must stay in their proper \nconstitutional lane and interpret the law \u2026 according \n\n53 \n \nto its text and history, leaving to Congress and the \nPresident\u201d the task of updating the law in light of \n\u201ccompeting contemporary needs.\u201d Id. at 567. \nThe Medicaid program is expensive for states. \n\u201cOn average, states spend 29% of their annual \nbudgets on costs related to Medicaid.\u201d Br. of Amici \nCuriae U.S. Senators and Representatives at 12, July \n5, 2024. \u201cThat makes Medicaid the costliest expendi-\nture for many state budgets.\u201d Ibid. (emphasis added). \n(Medicaid is a 24.3% share of South Carolina\u2019s state \nbudget. South Carolina At-a-Glance, State Health \nAccess Data Assistance Center, perma.cc/X3VL-\n25WT).  \nWhen federal courts discover private rights \nburied in state plan requirements, those costs \nincrease exponentially. \u201cAuthorizing lawsuits by \npatients to challenge their providers\u2019 terminations \nburdens state agencies with redundant and intrusive \noversight while the high cost of federal litigation \ndisplaces more efficient uses of state resources.\u201d \nPlanned Parenthood of Greater Tex. Fam. Plan. & \nPreventive Health Servs. v. Smith, 913 F.3d 551, 571 \n(5th \nCir. \n2019) \n(Jones, \nJ., \nconcurring). \nAnd \nRespondents\u2019 position creates the \u201cthreat of a federal \nlawsuit\u2014and its attendant costs and fees\u2014whenever \n[a state makes] changes\u201d to its list of qualified \nproviders. Gee v. Planned Parenthood of Gulf Coast, \nInc., 586 U.S. 1057, 1058 (2018) (Thomas, J., \ndissenting from the denial of cert.). Even just the \nthreat of litigation can impose real costs on real \npeople as the \u201clooming potential for complex litigation \ninevitably will dissuade state officials from making \ndecisions that they believe to be in the public \ninterest.\u201d Ibid. \n\n54 \n \nThe scope of such litigation is staggering. In a \n2020 report, the U.S. Department of Health and \nHuman Services\u2019 Office of Inspector General reported \nmore than 9,000 terminated Medicaid providers in its \ndatabase. Department of Health & Human Services \nOffice of the Inspector General, States Could Do More \nTo Prevent Terminated Providers From Serving \nMedicaid \nBeneficiaries \nat \n7 \n(Mar. \n2020), \nperma.cc/9JLQ-J696. Under Respondents\u2019 theory, \nbeneficiaries in each state have a right to file a \nSection 1983 lawsuit that seeks the reinstatement of \nevery one of those providers\u2014plus damages and \nattorney fees. \nThe problem is exponentially worse when consid-\nering more than just qualified-provider litigation. \nGiven the broader questions this case implicates, the \nCourt\u2019s decision could impact the costs imposed on \nstates across a host of federal spending programs. In \nthe adoption-and-foster-care context, for example, \nJudge Livingston has raised the alarm that\u2014under \nthe kinds of arguments that Respondents raise here\u2014\nstate foster-care programs face an \u201cunfortunate and \nunsupportable risk of increased litigation\u201d under the \nAdoption \nAssistance \nand \nChild \nWelfare \nAct, \n\u201cinconsistent results\u201d in those cases, \u201cand disorderly \nadministration, none of which will inure to those \nprograms\u2019 benefit.\u201d Poole, 922 F.3d at 95 (Livingston, \nJ., dissenting) (cleaned up). That \u201craises the prospect \nthat scarce foster care resources, instead of going to \nfoster children, will be squandered in litigation \ndestined to produce arbitrary and inconsistent \nresults.\u201d Id. at 97. If those costs are to be imposed on \nstates, that choice is best left to the people\u2019s elected \nrepresentatives in Congress. \n\n55 \n \n* * * \nNothing in the any-qualified-provider provision\u2019s \ntext or structure unambiguously expresses congres-\nsional intent to confer a federal private right on \nanyone. To hold otherwise would encroach upon the \nexecutive and legislative branches\u2019 prerogatives while \nincreasing the cost to the states of providing medical \ncare to their neediest citizens. And doing so would \ndrop Gonzaga\u2019s supposedly \u201cdemanding bar,\u201d 599 \nU.S. at 180, to the floor. Because the text and \nstructure of the any-qualified-provider provision do \nnot present the \u201catypical case,\u201d id. at 183, that provi-\nsion does not create private rights enforceable under \nSection 1983.  \nCONCLUSION \nThe judgment of the courts of appeals should be \nreversed. \n        Respectfully submitted, \nFEBRUARY 2025 \n \nKELLY M.

          "task_beliefs": "My beliefs about the case outcome remain stable following a failed search for new information. The observation did not provide the targeted document (Respondent's merits brief) and instead returned a document I have already analyzed (the Brief in Opposition). Therefore, my substantive understanding of the case has not changed.\n\n1.  **Core Legal Question & Controlling Test (Stable, Dominant Interpretation):** The central issue is whether 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a(a)(23)(A) contains \"unambiguously\" rights-creating language under the *Gonzaga*/*Talevski* standard. The Solicitor General's (SG) structural argument that it does not remains the most likely analytical framework for the Court's majority.\n2.  **Petitioner's Argumentative Framework (Stable and Strongly Reinforced):** South Carolina's position, as bolstered by the U.S. government, remains the predicted winning argument. The core claims\u2014that the provision is an administrative directive to the state, not an individual right, and that the remedy lies with HHS\u2014are unchanged.\n3.  **Respondent's Position (Stable, Significantly Weakened, Awaiting Rebuttal):** My understanding of the Respondent's arguments, derived from the Brief in Opposition (BIO), is stable. The search's failure to retrieve the merits brief means their direct response to the powerful arguments from the Petitioner and the SG is still unknown. This document continues to have the highest Expected Information Gain (EIG).\n4.  **The U.S. Government's Position (Dominant Signal):** The SG's amicus brief in support of the Petitioner remains the single most predictive signal. Its reasoning, which distinguishes this provision from the one in *Talevski* based on statutory structure and context, is the cornerstone of my prediction.\n5.  **The Government's Change in Position (Key Dynamic):** This fact remains a critical piece of context, highlighting the legal impact of the *Talevski* decision. It is a likely topic for oral argument but does not alter the legal analysis likely to be adopted by the majority.\n6.  **Updated State of Uncertainty (Stable, Low, and Focused):** My overall uncertainty about the outcome remains very low. I predict a ruling for the Petitioner with high confidence. The primary remaining uncertainty is tactical: how will the Respondents' counsel frame their arguments on the merits in the face of the SG's opposition? This failed search confirms that this information is not yet available to me.\n7.  **Administrative Details (Stable):** All party and counsel information remains stable. The search returned a document listing Nicole A. Saharsky of Mayer Brown LLP as Counsel of Record for the Respondents on the BIO, which is consistent with prior knowledge.",
          "design_beliefs": "This observation, a failed search, provides crucial feedback on the information-gathering process itself, leading to important refinements in my strategic heuristics.\n\n1.  **\"Petitioner-First\" Heuristic:** Confirmed.\n2.  **\"The *Talevski* Litmus Test\" (Refined):** Confirmed. The key remains the provision's language and, crucially, its structural placement within the statute.\n3.  **\"Precedent Bracketing\":** Confirmed.\n4.  **Refined Source Prioritization:** Confirmed. The SG brief is a Tier-1 source.\n5.  **\"The Meta-Cognitive Loop\" & \"Conscious EIG Targeting\" (STRONGLY VALIDATED):** This heuristic correctly identified the Respondent's merits brief as the next target. The failure of the search does not invalidate the strategy; it simply reveals that the information is not yet available or findable with the current query, which is itself valuable information.\n6.  **\"BIO as Merits Blueprint\":** This holds, but with the caveat that intervening events (like the SG's brief) can force a significant strategic pivot in the actual merits brief.\n7.  **\"Track Changes in Position\":** Confirmed.\n8.  **\"Structural Arguments Can Trump Beneficiary-Focus Arguments\":** Confirmed as a key post-*Talevski* interpretive principle.\n9.  **\"Amicus Briefs as Signals\" (Refined):** Confirmed, with the SG's brief being in a class of its own.\n10. **\"Prioritize the SG's View in Federal Statutory Cases\":** Confirmed as a heuristic with high predictive power.\n11. **\"Argumentative Framing is Key\":** Confirmed.\n12. **\"Table of Authorities as a Map\":** Confirmed.\n13. **\"The Reflective Pause (THINK Step)\" (Reinforced):** The previous THINK step correctly identified the next logical target. This null-result observation reinforces the value of such pauses to ensure the analytical path remains deliberate, even when encountering obstacles.\n14. **NEW Heuristic: \"Verify Search Results and Distinguish Document Types.\"** The search for a \"merits brief\" returned a \"Brief in Opposition.\" These are fundamentally different documents filed at different stages of litigation with different strategic purposes. This observation proves the critical importance of verifying that a search result's title and content match the intended query. A BIO argues *against* hearing a case; a merits brief argues the substance of the case *after* it has been accepted.\n15. **NEW Heuristic: \"Account for Litigation Timing.\"** A failed search for a document may not mean the query is wrong, but that the search is premature. Supreme Court litigation follows a predictable schedule (Cert Grant -> Petitioner Merits Brief -> Respondent Merits Brief, etc.). My information-gathering actions must be sensitive to this timeline. The absence of the Respondent's merits brief likely means it has not yet been filed or indexed. This is a constraint on the environment, not a failure of strategy."

South Carolina terminated the \nMedicaid \nprovider \nagreement \nof \na \nPlanned \nParenthood affiliate without cause.  The affiliate and \none of its patients sued under 42 U.S.C. 1983.  The \npatient invoked the Medicaid Act\u2019s free-choice-of-\nprovider provision, which states that \u201cany individual \neligible for medical assistance\u201d \u201cmay obtain such \nassistance from any institution\u201d that is \u201cqualified to \nperform the service or services required\u201d and \n\u201cundertakes to provide [the individual] such services.\u201d  \n42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(23)(A).   \nThree times, the court of appeals has held that the \nfree-choice-of-provider \nprovision \nunambiguously \nconfers a right that is privately enforceable under \nSection 1983.

KERR, DIRECTOR, SOUTH CAROLINA  \nDEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, \nPETITIONER\nv. \nPLANNED PARENTHOOD SOUTH ATLANTIC, ET AL. \nOn Petition for a Writ of Certiorari to the  \nUnited States Court of Appeals  \nfor the Fourth Circuit \nBRIEF IN OPPOSITION\nOPINIONS BELOW \nThe opinion of the court of appeals (Pet. App. 1a-\n36a) is reported at 95 F.4th 152.  The opinion of the \ndistrict court (Pet. App. 68a-79a) is reported at 487 F. \nSupp. 3d 443.   \nPrior relevant opinions of the court of appeals (Pet. \nApp. 38a-65a, 80a-125a) are reported at 27 F.4th 945 \nand 941 F.3d 687.  A prior relevant order of the district \ncourt (Pet. App. 126a-146a) is reported at 326 F. Supp. \n3d 39.  \nJURISDICTION \nThe judgment of the court of appeals was entered \non March 5, 2024.  The petition for a writ of certiorari \nwas filed on June 3, 2024.  The jurisdiction of this \nCourt is invoked under 28 U.S.C. 1254(1).  \n\n2 \n \n \n \nSTATEMENT \nPlanned Parenthood South Atlantic (PPSAT) \nprovides essential medical services, including birth \ncontrol, cancer screenings, and physical exams, to low-\nincome South Carolina residents through the state\u2019s \nMedicaid program.  South Carolina terminated \nPPSAT\u2019s participation in that program, even though \nit \u201cagree[s]\u201d that PPSAT \u201cis perfectly competent to \nprovide  *  *  *  healthcare.\u201d  Pet. App. 41a.  PPSAT \nand one of its patients, who relies on PPSAT for care \nthat is critical for preserving her health, sued under \n42 U.S.C. 1983.  They contended that the termination \nviolates the Medicaid Act\u2019s free-choice-of-provider \nprovision, 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(23)(A), which gives \nMedicaid recipients the right to choose to receive their \nmedical care from any qualified and willing provider.  \nPet. App. 6a, 8a.   \nThe district court preliminarily enjoined the \ndirector of the state health department (petitioner) \nfrom terminating PPSAT\u2019s participation in the \nMedicaid program, Pet. App. 126a-146a; the court of \nappeals affirmed, id. at 80a-119a; and this Court \ndenied certiorari, see id. at 47a. \nThe \ndistrict \ncourt \nthen \ngranted \nsummary \njudgment to PPSAT and the patient, id. at 66a-79a; \nthe court of appeals affirmed, id. at 64a; and this \nCourt granted the petition, vacated, and remanded in \nlight of Health & Hospital Corp. of Marion County v. \nTalevski, 599 U.S. 166 (2023), Pet. App. 37a.  After \nreconsidering its prior holding in light of Talevski, the \ncourt of appeals again affirmed, with all three judges \nagreeing that the Medicaid Act\u2019s free-choice-of-\nprovider provision is privately enforceable under \nSection 1983.  Id. at 1a-35a; id. at 36a (Richardson, J., \nconcurring in the judgment).   \n\n3 \n \n \n \n1. Medicaid is the national health insurance \nprogram for persons of limited financial means.  Pet. \nApp. 5a.  It provides federal funding for medical care \nfor children, needy families, the elderly, the blind, the \ndisabled, and pregnant women.  See 42 U.S.C. \n1396d(a).   \nMedicaid is a joint federal-state effort.  Pet. App. \n5a.  A state must comply with various federal \nrequirements to participate, see Armstrong v. \nExceptional Child Ctr., Inc., 575 U.S. 320, 323 (2015), \nincluding the free-choice-of-provider requirement.  To \ncomply with that requirement, a state\u2019s Medicaid plan \n\u201cmust\u201d provide that \u201cany individual eligible for \nmedical assistance  *  *  *  may obtain such assistance\u201d \nfrom any provider who is \u201cqualified to perform the \nservice or services required\u201d and \u201cwho undertakes to \nprovide \nhim \nsuch \nservices.\u201d \n \n42 \nU.S.C. \n1396a(a)(23)(A).   \n2. PPSAT and its predecessors have provided \nhealth care to low-income residents of South Carolina \nfor four decades.  Pet. App. 7a, 58a.  PPSAT operates \ntwo health centers in the state, one in Charleston and \none in Columbia.  Id. at 6a.  Both are in medically \nunderserved communities.  See Resp. C.A. Br. 4, No. \n21-1043 (4th Cir. May 28, 2021) (21-1043 Resp. C.A. \nBr.).  Those centers serve hundreds of Medicaid \npatients each year.  Pet. App. 7a, 87a. \nPPSAT\u2019s health centers provide essential medical \ncare through Medicaid.  They offer a range of services, \nincluding \nphysical \nexams; \ncancer \nscreenings; \ncontraception; pregnancy testing and counseling; and \nscreening for conditions such as diabetes, depression, \nanemia, cholesterol, thyroid disorders, and high blood \npressure.  Pet. App. 6a, 69a; 21-1043 Resp. C.A. Br. 4.  \nThe health centers provide abortion services, but \nMedicaid does not pay for abortion except in the very \n\n4 \n \n \n \nlimited circumstances required by federal law.  Pet. \nApp. 6a-7a. \nPatients insured through Medicaid choose PPSAT \nfor many reasons.  PPSAT provides non-judgmental, \nhigh-quality medical care.  See Pet. App. 6a-7a.  It also \nhas designed its services to help low-income patients \novercome barriers to accessing care.  Id. at 7a.  For \nexample, PPSAT offers extended hours and flexible \nscheduling; same-day appointments and short wait \ntimes; comprehensive contraceptive care in a single \nappointment; and interpreter services for patients \nwho do not speak English.  Ibid.  PPSAT continued to \noffer high-quality medical care during the COVID-19 \npandemic, including through telemedicine.  21-1043 \nResp. C.A. Br. 5.  That ensured continuity of care for \nlow-income patients and lessened the burdens on \nother parts of the health care system.  Pet. App. 7a-8a \n& n.2.   \nRespondent Julie Edwards is a Medicaid patient \nwho has received care at PPSAT.  Pet. App. 7a.  She \nsuffers from diabetes.  Id. at 44a.  Because doctors \nhave advised her that complications from diabetes \nwould make it dangerous for her to carry a pregnancy \nto term, she sought access to safe and effective birth \ncontrol.  Ibid.  After having difficulty finding a doctor \nwho would treat her, she obtained care at PPSAT.  Id. \nat 7a, 44a.  PPSAT doctors provided her with birth \ncontrol and also informed her that her blood pressure \nwas elevated, so she could obtain follow-up care for \nthat issue.  Ibid.  Ms. Edwards was impressed with \nPPSAT and intends to obtain future gynecological and \nreproductive health care there.  Ibid.   \n3. In July 2018, South Carolina\u2019s Department of \nHealth and Human Services (SCDHHS) terminated \nPPSAT\u2019s participation in the state Medicaid program.  \nPet. App. 8a, 70a.  The termination was prompted by \n\n5 \n \n \n \nthe Governor, who issued two executive orders \ndesigned to withdraw state funding from any \norganization that provides abortions, purportedly \nbased on a twenty-five-year-old statute.  Id. at 8a, 88a; \nsee S.C. Code Ann. \u00a7 43-5-1185. \nRelying on those orders, SCDHHS terminated \nPPSAT\u2019s state Medicaid agreement.  Pet. App. 8a.  \nSCDHHS did not find that PPSAT is unqualified to \nprovide care.  Id. at 87a.  Instead, it terminated \nPPSAT\u2019s participation in Medicaid \u201csolely because \n[PPSAT] performed abortions outside of the Medicaid \nprogram.\u201d  Ibid.  As a result of the termination, \nPPSAT\u2019s health centers immediately had to begin \nturning away Medicaid patients.  Id. at 88a. \n4. Respondents sued under 42 U.S.C. 1983.  Pet. \nApp. 8a.  They alleged, inter alia, that the termination \nviolates the Medicaid Act\u2019s free-choice-of-provider \nprovision.  Ibid.  They sought preliminary injunctive \nrelief, so that Ms. Edwards and other patients could \ncontinue to receive care from their chosen providers.  \nIbid. \nThe \ndistrict \ncourt \nentered \na \npreliminary \ninjunction.  Pet. App. 126a-146a.  As a threshold \nmatter, it held that the Medicaid Act\u2019s free-choice-of-\nprovider requirement is privately enforceable under \nSection 1983 because the statute \u201cunambiguously \nconfers a right\u201d on Medicaid patients to \u201cobtain \nassistance from any qualified and willing provider.\u201d  \nId. at 134a.  Then, on the merits, the court concluded \nthat petitioner likely violated the Medicaid Act by \nterminating PPSAT\u2019s Medicaid participation without \ncause.  Id. at 138a-141a.  The court found it \n\u201cundisputed\u201d that PPSAT is \u201cqualified\u201d to provide \nmedical care, as the statute requires.  Id. at 138a-139a \n(citing 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(23)(A)).   \n\n6 \n \n \n \nThe court of appeals affirmed the preliminary \ninjunction.  Pet. App. 80a-125a.  Like the district \ncourt, the court of appeals concluded that a Medicaid \npatient may sue under Section 1983 to enforce the \nfree-choice-of-provider requirement.  Id. at 94a-98a.  \nApplying this Court\u2019s decisions in Blessing v. \nFreestone, 520 U.S. 329 (1997), and Gonzaga \nUniversity v. Doe, 536 U.S. 273 (2002), the court of \nappeals recognized that a federal statute creates a \nright enforceable under Section 1983 \u201conly when the \nunderlying statute itself unambiguously \u2018confers an \nindividual right\u2019 on the plaintiff.\u201d  Pet. App. 94a \n(quoting Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at 284-285).   \nHere, the court of appeals explained, the statute is \n\u201cunmistakably \nclear\u201d \nin \ncreating \na \nprivately \nenforceable right.  Pet. App. 103a-104a.  \u201cIf th[is] \nlanguage does not suffice to confer a private right, \nenforceable under \u00a7 1983,\u201d the court stated, \u201cit is \ndifficult to see what language would be adequate.\u201d  Id. \nat 102a.  All three judges agreed on this point.  See \nibid.; id. at 120a-125a (Richardson, J., concurring) \n(agreeing that the statute \u201cunambiguously create[s] a \nright privately enforceable under \u00a7 1983\u201d).    \nOn the merits, the court of appeals concluded that \nPPSAT and Ms. Edwards established a likelihood of \nsuccess on the merits because under the free-choice-\nof-provider provision, a state may not exclude a \nqualified and willing provider.  Pet. App. 138a-141a.  \nThe court noted that petitioner did not dispute that \n\u201cPPSAT is professionally qualified to deliver the \nservices that [Ms. Edwards] seeks.\u201d  Id. at 107a; see \nid. at 98a n.3 (\u201cPPSAT\u2019s qualifications are simply not \nin dispute\u201d in this case.).  The court rejected \npetitioner\u2019s argument that it can terminate the \nMedicaid contract of any provider it wishes even when \n\n7 \n \n \n \nit \u201cadmits\u201d that the provider is \u201cperfectly competent.\u201d  \nId. at 109a-110a.   \nPetitioner filed a petition for a writ of certiorari, \nwhich this Court denied.  Baker v. Planned \nParenthood S. Atl., 141 S. Ct. 550 (2020) (No. 19-\n1186). \n5. The district court granted summary judgment \nto PPSAT and Ms. Edwards and entered a permanent \ninjunction.  Pet App. 68a-79a.  The court again held \nthat \nthe \nMedicaid \nAct\u2019s \nfree-choice-of-provider \nprovision is privately enforceable under Section 1983 \nand determined that petitioner violated the Medicaid \nAct by terminating PPSAT\u2019s participation in the state \nMedicaid program.  Id. at 74a.  The court noted that \npetitioner did not dispute that PPSAT is a \u201cmedically \nand professionally qualified provider\u201d and determined \nthat petitioner accordingly had no valid basis for the \ntermination.  Ibid. \nThe court of appeals affirmed.  Pet. App. 38a-64a.  \nThe court again held that Medicaid\u2019s free-choice-of-\nprovider provision confers a right enforceable under \nSection 1983.  Id. at 54a-64a.  The court carefully \nreviewed this Court\u2019s precedents and recognized that \n\u201cnothing \u2018short of an unambiguously conferred right\u2019  \n*  *  *  may support a cause of action.\u201d  Id. at 55a \n(quoting Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at 283).  The statute here, \nthe \ncourt \nexplained, \n\u201cunmistakably \nevinces \nCongress\u2019s \nintention \nto \nconfer \non \nMedicaid \nbeneficiaries a right to the free choice of their \nprovider\u201d because it confers an individual right in \nmandatory terms; courts are competent to determine \nif a provider is qualified; and the Medicaid Act does \nnot provide a comprehensive enforcement scheme that \nshows \nCongress\u2019s \nintent \nto \nforeclose \nprivate \nenforcement.  Id. at 57a-62a.  Again, all three judges \nagreed that the statute unambiguously confers a \n\n8 \n \n \n \nprivate right enforceable under Section 1983.  Id. at \n51a-64a; id. at 65a (Richardson, J., concurring in the \njudgment).  \nThe court of appeals noted that petitioner no \nlonger contested the merits.  Pet. App. 51a.  \nSpecifically, petitioner \u201cd[id] not\u201d renew his merits \narguments \nto \n\u201cchallenge \nthe \ndistrict \ncourt\u2019s \ndetermination (and [the court of appeals\u2019] own \nprevious conclusion) that South Carolina violated\u201d the \nfree-choice-of-provider provision \u201cby terminating \nPlanned Parenthood\u2019s Medicaid provider agreement.\u201d  \nId. at 51a n.1.  \n6. This Court then granted the petition for a writ \nof certiorari in Talevski.  That petition presented two \nquestions:  (1) whether a federal statute that Congress \nenacted using its Spending Clause power can give rise \nto a right enforceable under Section 1983, and \n(2) whether two provisions in the Federal Nursing \nHome \nReform \nAct \n(FNHRA), \n42 \nU.S.C. \n1396r(c)(1)(A)(ii) and 1396r(c)(2)(A), are privately \nenforceable under Section 1983.  See Pet. at *i-ii, \nHealth & Hosp. Corp. of Marion Cnty. v. Talevski, No. \n21-806, 2021 WL 5702312 (Nov. 23, 2021).  The Court \nanswered both questions in the affirmative.  Talevski, \n599 U.S. at 175-191.  In concluding that the provisions \nat issue are privately enforceable under Section 1983, \nthe Court applied its \u201cestablished method for \nascertaining unambiguous conferral\u201d of an individual \nright.  Id. at 183; see id. at 175-191.  \nIn the meantime, petitioner filed a petition for a \nwrit of certiorari in this case.  The Court granted the \npetition, vacated the judgment of the court of appeals, \nand remanded the case for further consideration in \nlight of Talevski.  Kerr v. Planned Parenthood S. Atl., \n143 S. Ct. 2633 (2023) (No. 21-1431). \n\n9 \n \n \n \n7. The court of appeals affirmed.  Pet. App. 1a-\n36a.  \u201c[W]ith the benefit of Talevski\u2019s guidance,\u201d the \ncourt again held that the free-choice-of-provider \nprovision \nconfers \na \nright \nenforceable \nunder \nSection 1983.  Id. at 12a-13a. \nThe court of appeals explained that the free-choice-\nof-provider provision is enforceable under Section \n1983 \nbecause \nit \n\u201cexplicitly \ngives \nMedicaid \nbeneficiaries the right to the provider of their choice\u201d \nand \u201cthere is no indication that Congress wanted to \nforeclose such individuals from seeking relief under \n\u00a7 1983.\u201d  Pet. App. 14a.  On the first point, the court \nreviewed this Court\u2019s precedents and recognized that \n\u201c\u200a\u2018Gonzaga sets forth [the] established method for \nascertaining unambiguous conferral\u2019 of individual \nrights.\u201d  Id. at 19a (quoting Talevski, 599 U.S. at 183).  \nThat test is satisfied, the court continued, \u201cwhere the \nprovision in question is \u2018phrased in terms of the \npersons benefited\u2019 and contains \u2018rights-creating,\u2019 \nindividual-centric language with an \u2018unmistakable \nfocus on the benefited class.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Ibid. (quoting Talevski, \n599 U.S. at 183 (in turn quoting Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at \n284, 287)).   \nHere, the court of appeals explained, the free-\nchoice-of-provider provision unambiguously confers \nrights on individual Medicaid recipients:  \u201cLike the \ntext at issue in Talevski,\u201d the free-choice-of-provider \nprovision \u201cspeak[s] \u2018in terms of the person benefited,\u2019 \nand ha[s] an \u2018unmistakable focus on the benefited \nclass.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Pet. App. 25a (quoting Talevski, 599 U.S. at \n186).  The free-choice-of-provider provision, the court \nexplained, \u201cfocus[es] on discrete beneficiaries and \nguarantee[s] them a choice\u201d of any qualified medical \nprovider \u201cfree from state interference.\u201d  Ibid.  The \ncourt noted that Talevski \u201cbolstered [its] previous \nconclusion\u201d by providing examples of rights-creating \n\n10 \n \n \n \nlanguage \u201csimilar to the language\u201d in the free-choice-\nof-provider provision.  Ibid.   \nPetitioner had argued that the court of appeals \nshould reverse its prior holdings because its decisions \ncited Blessing and Wilder v. Virginia Hospital Ass\u2019n, \n496 U.S. 498 (1990), and in petitioner\u2019s view, those \ndecisions no longer are good law after Talevski.  Pet. \nApp. 14a.

South Carolina terminated the \nMedicaid \nprovider \nagreement \nof \na \nPlanned \nParenthood affiliate without cause.  The affiliate and \none of its patients sued under 42 U.S.C. 1983.  The \npatient invoked the Medicaid Act\u2019s free-choice-of-\nprovider provision, which states that \u201cany individual \neligible for medical assistance\u201d \u201cmay obtain such \nassistance from any institution\u201d that is \u201cqualified to \nperform the service or services required\u201d and \n\u201cundertakes to provide [the individual] such services.\u201d  \n42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(23)(A).   \nThree times, the court of appeals has held that the \nfree-choice-of-provider \nprovision \nunambiguously \nconfers a right that is privately enforceable under \nSection 1983.  In its most recent decision, the court of \nappeals so held after faithfully applying this Court\u2019s \nrecent decision in Health & Hospital Corp. of Marion \nCounty v. Talevski, 599 U.S. 166 (2023).  \nThe question presented is:  \nWhether the Medicaid Act\u2019s free-choice-of-provider \nprovision, 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(23)(A), confers a right \nenforceable under 42 U.S.C. 1983.   \n \n \n\nii \n \n \n \nRULE 29.6 STATEMENT \nPlanned Parenthood South Atlantic is a North \nCarolina non-profit corporation.

App. 1a-\n36a) is reported at 95 F.4th 152.  The opinion of the \ndistrict court (Pet. App. 68a-79a) is reported at 487 F. \nSupp. 3d 443.   \nPrior relevant opinions of the court of appeals (Pet. \nApp. 38a-65a, 80a-125a) are reported at 27 F.4th 945 \nand 941 F.3d 687.  A prior relevant order of the district \ncourt (Pet. App. 126a-146a) is reported at 326 F. Supp. \n3d 39.  \nJURISDICTION \nThe judgment of the court of appeals was entered \non March 5, 2024.  The petition for a writ of certiorari \nwas filed on June 3, 2024.  The jurisdiction of this \nCourt is invoked under 28 U.S.C. 1254(1).  \n\n2 \n \n \n \nSTATEMENT \nPlanned Parenthood South Atlantic (PPSAT) \nprovides essential medical services, including birth \ncontrol, cancer screenings, and physical exams, to low-\nincome South Carolina residents through the state\u2019s \nMedicaid program.  South Carolina terminated \nPPSAT\u2019s participation in that program, even though \nit \u201cagree[s]\u201d that PPSAT \u201cis perfectly competent to \nprovide  *  *  *  healthcare.\u201d  Pet. App. 41a.  PPSAT \nand one of its patients, who relies on PPSAT for care \nthat is critical for preserving her health, sued under \n42 U.S.C. 1983.  They contended that the termination \nviolates the Medicaid Act\u2019s free-choice-of-provider \nprovision, 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(23)(A), which gives \nMedicaid recipients the right to choose to receive their \nmedical care from any qualified and willing provider.  \nPet. App. 6a, 8a.   \nThe district court preliminarily enjoined the \ndirector of the state health department (petitioner) \nfrom terminating PPSAT\u2019s participation in the \nMedicaid program, Pet. App. 126a-146a; the court of \nappeals affirmed, id. at 80a-119a; and this Court \ndenied certiorari, see id. at 47a. \nThe \ndistrict \ncourt \nthen \ngranted \nsummary \njudgment to PPSAT and the patient, id. at 66a-79a; \nthe court of appeals affirmed, id. at 64a; and this \nCourt granted the petition, vacated, and remanded in \nlight of Health & Hospital Corp. of Marion County v. \nTalevski, 599 U.S. 166 (2023), Pet. App. 37a.  After \nreconsidering its prior holding in light of Talevski, the \ncourt of appeals again affirmed, with all three judges \nagreeing that the Medicaid Act\u2019s free-choice-of-\nprovider provision is privately enforceable under \nSection 1983.  Id. at 1a-35a; id. at 36a (Richardson, J., \nconcurring in the judgment).   \n\n3 \n \n \n \n1. Medicaid is the national health insurance \nprogram for persons of limited financial means.  Pet. \nApp. 5a.  It provides federal funding for medical care \nfor children, needy families, the elderly, the blind, the \ndisabled, and pregnant women.  See 42 U.S.C. \n1396d(a).   \nMedicaid is a joint federal-state effort.  Pet. App. \n5a.  A state must comply with various federal \nrequirements to participate, see Armstrong v. \nExceptional Child Ctr., Inc., 575 U.S. 320, 323 (2015), \nincluding the free-choice-of-provider requirement.  To \ncomply with that requirement, a state\u2019s Medicaid plan \n\u201cmust\u201d provide that \u201cany individual eligible for \nmedical assistance  *  *  *  may obtain such assistance\u201d \nfrom any provider who is \u201cqualified to perform the \nservice or services required\u201d and \u201cwho undertakes to \nprovide \nhim \nsuch \nservices.\u201d \n \n42 \nU.S.C. \n1396a(a)(23)(A).   \n2. PPSAT and its predecessors have provided \nhealth care to low-income residents of South Carolina \nfor four decades.  Pet. App. 7a, 58a.  PPSAT operates \ntwo health centers in the state, one in Charleston and \none in Columbia.  Id. at 6a.  Both are in medically \nunderserved communities.  See Resp. C.A. Br. 4, No. \n21-1043 (4th Cir. May 28, 2021) (21-1043 Resp. C.A. \nBr.).  Those centers serve hundreds of Medicaid \npatients each year.  Pet. App. 7a, 87a. \nPPSAT\u2019s health centers provide essential medical \ncare through Medicaid.  They offer a range of services, \nincluding \nphysical \nexams; \ncancer \nscreenings; \ncontraception; pregnancy testing and counseling; and \nscreening for conditions such as diabetes, depression, \nanemia, cholesterol, thyroid disorders, and high blood \npressure.  Pet. App. 6a, 69a; 21-1043 Resp. C.A. Br. 4.  \nThe health centers provide abortion services, but \nMedicaid does not pay for abortion except in the very \n\n4 \n \n \n \nlimited circumstances required by federal law.  Pet. \nApp. 6a-7a. \nPatients insured through Medicaid choose PPSAT \nfor many reasons.  PPSAT provides non-judgmental, \nhigh-quality medical care.  See Pet. App. 6a-7a.  It also \nhas designed its services to help low-income patients \novercome barriers to accessing care.  Id. at 7a.  For \nexample, PPSAT offers extended hours and flexible \nscheduling; same-day appointments and short wait \ntimes; comprehensive contraceptive care in a single \nappointment; and interpreter services for patients \nwho do not speak English.  Ibid.  PPSAT continued to \noffer high-quality medical care during the COVID-19 \npandemic, including through telemedicine.  21-1043 \nResp. C.A. Br. 5.  That ensured continuity of care for \nlow-income patients and lessened the burdens on \nother parts of the health care system.  Pet. App. 7a-8a \n& n.2.   \nRespondent Julie Edwards is a Medicaid patient \nwho has received care at PPSAT.  Pet. App. 7a.  She \nsuffers from diabetes.  Id. at 44a.  Because doctors \nhave advised her that complications from diabetes \nwould make it dangerous for her to carry a pregnancy \nto term, she sought access to safe and effective birth \ncontrol.  Ibid.  After having difficulty finding a doctor \nwho would treat her, she obtained care at PPSAT.  Id. \nat 7a, 44a.  PPSAT doctors provided her with birth \ncontrol and also informed her that her blood pressure \nwas elevated, so she could obtain follow-up care for \nthat issue.  Ibid.  Ms. Edwards was impressed with \nPPSAT and intends to obtain future gynecological and \nreproductive health care there.  Ibid.   \n3. In July 2018, South Carolina\u2019s Department of \nHealth and Human Services (SCDHHS) terminated \nPPSAT\u2019s participation in the state Medicaid program.  \nPet. App. 8a, 70a.  The termination was prompted by \n\n5 \n \n \n \nthe Governor, who issued two executive orders \ndesigned to withdraw state funding from any \norganization that provides abortions, purportedly \nbased on a twenty-five-year-old statute.  Id. at 8a, 88a; \nsee S.C. Code Ann. \u00a7 43-5-1185. \nRelying on those orders, SCDHHS terminated \nPPSAT\u2019s state Medicaid agreement.  Pet. App. 8a.  \nSCDHHS did not find that PPSAT is unqualified to \nprovide care.  Id. at 87a.  Instead, it terminated \nPPSAT\u2019s participation in Medicaid \u201csolely because \n[PPSAT] performed abortions outside of the Medicaid \nprogram.\u201d  Ibid.  As a result of the termination, \nPPSAT\u2019s health centers immediately had to begin \nturning away Medicaid patients.  Id. at 88a. \n4. Respondents sued under 42 U.S.C. 1983.  Pet. \nApp. 8a.  They alleged, inter alia, that the termination \nviolates the Medicaid Act\u2019s free-choice-of-provider \nprovision.  Ibid.  They sought preliminary injunctive \nrelief, so that Ms. Edwards and other patients could \ncontinue to receive care from their chosen providers.  \nIbid. \nThe \ndistrict \ncourt \nentered \na \npreliminary \ninjunction.  Pet. App. 126a-146a.  As a threshold \nmatter, it held that the Medicaid Act\u2019s free-choice-of-\nprovider requirement is privately enforceable under \nSection 1983 because the statute \u201cunambiguously \nconfers a right\u201d on Medicaid patients to \u201cobtain \nassistance from any qualified and willing provider.\u201d  \nId. at 134a.  Then, on the merits, the court concluded \nthat petitioner likely violated the Medicaid Act by \nterminating PPSAT\u2019s Medicaid participation without \ncause.  Id. at 138a-141a.  The court found it \n\u201cundisputed\u201d that PPSAT is \u201cqualified\u201d to provide \nmedical care, as the statute requires.  Id. at 138a-139a \n(citing 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(23)(A)).   \n\n6 \n \n \n \nThe court of appeals affirmed the preliminary \ninjunction.  Pet. App. 80a-125a.  Like the district \ncourt, the court of appeals concluded that a Medicaid \npatient may sue under Section 1983 to enforce the \nfree-choice-of-provider requirement.  Id. at 94a-98a.  \nApplying this Court\u2019s decisions in Blessing v. \nFreestone, 520 U.S. 329 (1997), and Gonzaga \nUniversity v. Doe, 536 U.S. 273 (2002), the court of \nappeals recognized that a federal statute creates a \nright enforceable under Section 1983 \u201conly when the \nunderlying statute itself unambiguously \u2018confers an \nindividual right\u2019 on the plaintiff.\u201d  Pet. App. 94a \n(quoting Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at 284-285).   \nHere, the court of appeals explained, the statute is \n\u201cunmistakably \nclear\u201d \nin \ncreating \na \nprivately \nenforceable right.  Pet. App. 103a-104a.  \u201cIf th[is] \nlanguage does not suffice to confer a private right, \nenforceable under \u00a7 1983,\u201d the court stated, \u201cit is \ndifficult to see what language would be adequate.\u201d  Id. \nat 102a.  All three judges agreed on this point.  See \nibid.; id. at 120a-125a (Richardson, J., concurring) \n(agreeing that the statute \u201cunambiguously create[s] a \nright privately enforceable under \u00a7 1983\u201d).    \nOn the merits, the court of appeals concluded that \nPPSAT and Ms. Edwards established a likelihood of \nsuccess on the merits because under the free-choice-\nof-provider provision, a state may not exclude a \nqualified and willing provider.  Pet. App. 138a-141a.  \nThe court noted that petitioner did not dispute that \n\u201cPPSAT is professionally qualified to deliver the \nservices that [Ms. Edwards] seeks.\u201d  Id. at 107a; see \nid. at 98a n.3 (\u201cPPSAT\u2019s qualifications are simply not \nin dispute\u201d in this case.).  The court rejected \npetitioner\u2019s argument that it can terminate the \nMedicaid contract of any provider it wishes even when \n\n7 \n \n \n \nit \u201cadmits\u201d that the provider is \u201cperfectly competent.\u201d  \nId. at 109a-110a.   \nPetitioner filed a petition for a writ of certiorari, \nwhich this Court denied.  Baker v. Planned \nParenthood S. Atl., 141 S. Ct. 550 (2020) (No. 19-\n1186). \n5. The district court granted summary judgment \nto PPSAT and Ms. Edwards and entered a permanent \ninjunction.  Pet App. 68a-79a.  The court again held \nthat \nthe \nMedicaid \nAct\u2019s \nfree-choice-of-provider \nprovision is privately enforceable under Section 1983 \nand determined that petitioner violated the Medicaid \nAct by terminating PPSAT\u2019s participation in the state \nMedicaid program.  Id. at 74a.  The court noted that \npetitioner did not dispute that PPSAT is a \u201cmedically \nand professionally qualified provider\u201d and determined \nthat petitioner accordingly had no valid basis for the \ntermination.  Ibid. \nThe court of appeals affirmed.  Pet. App. 38a-64a.  \nThe court again held that Medicaid\u2019s free-choice-of-\nprovider provision confers a right enforceable under \nSection 1983.  Id. at 54a-64a.  The court carefully \nreviewed this Court\u2019s precedents and recognized that \n\u201cnothing \u2018short of an unambiguously conferred right\u2019  \n*  *  *  may support a cause of action.\u201d  Id. at 55a \n(quoting Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at 283).  The statute here, \nthe \ncourt \nexplained, \n\u201cunmistakably \nevinces \nCongress\u2019s \nintention \nto \nconfer \non \nMedicaid \nbeneficiaries a right to the free choice of their \nprovider\u201d because it confers an individual right in \nmandatory terms; courts are competent to determine \nif a provider is qualified; and the Medicaid Act does \nnot provide a comprehensive enforcement scheme that \nshows \nCongress\u2019s \nintent \nto \nforeclose \nprivate \nenforcement.  Id. at 57a-62a.  Again, all three judges \nagreed that the statute unambiguously confers a \n\n8 \n \n \n \nprivate right enforceable under Section 1983.  Id. at \n51a-64a; id. at 65a (Richardson, J., concurring in the \njudgment).  \nThe court of appeals noted that petitioner no \nlonger contested the merits.  Pet. App. 51a.  \nSpecifically, petitioner \u201cd[id] not\u201d renew his merits \narguments \nto \n\u201cchallenge \nthe \ndistrict \ncourt\u2019s \ndetermination (and [the court of appeals\u2019] own \nprevious conclusion) that South Carolina violated\u201d the \nfree-choice-of-provider provision \u201cby terminating \nPlanned Parenthood\u2019s Medicaid provider agreement.\u201d  \nId. at 51a n.1.  \n6. This Court then granted the petition for a writ \nof certiorari in Talevski.  That petition presented two \nquestions:  (1) whether a federal statute that Congress \nenacted using its Spending Clause power can give rise \nto a right enforceable under Section 1983, and \n(2) whether two provisions in the Federal Nursing \nHome \nReform \nAct \n(FNHRA), \n42 \nU.S.C. \n1396r(c)(1)(A)(ii) and 1396r(c)(2)(A), are privately \nenforceable under Section 1983.  See Pet. at *i-ii, \nHealth & Hosp. Corp. of Marion Cnty. v. Talevski, No. \n21-806, 2021 WL 5702312 (Nov. 23, 2021).  The Court \nanswered both questions in the affirmative.  Talevski, \n599 U.S. at 175-191.  In concluding that the provisions \nat issue are privately enforceable under Section 1983, \nthe Court applied its \u201cestablished method for \nascertaining unambiguous conferral\u201d of an individual \nright.  Id. at 183; see id. at 175-191.  \nIn the meantime, petitioner filed a petition for a \nwrit of certiorari in this case.  The Court granted the \npetition, vacated the judgment of the court of appeals, \nand remanded the case for further consideration in \nlight of Talevski.  Kerr v. Planned Parenthood S. Atl., \n143 S. Ct. 2633 (2023) (No. 21-1431). \n\n9 \n \n \n \n7. The court of appeals affirmed.  Pet. App. 1a-\n36a.  \u201c[W]ith the benefit of Talevski\u2019s guidance,\u201d the \ncourt again held that the free-choice-of-provider \nprovision \nconfers \na \nright \nenforceable \nunder \nSection 1983.  Id. at 12a-13a. \nThe court of appeals explained that the free-choice-\nof-provider provision is enforceable under Section \n1983 \nbecause \nit \n\u201cexplicitly \ngives \nMedicaid \nbeneficiaries the right to the provider of their choice\u201d \nand \u201cthere is no indication that Congress wanted to \nforeclose such individuals from seeking relief under \n\u00a7 1983.\u201d  Pet. App. 14a.  On the first point, the court \nreviewed this Court\u2019s precedents and recognized that \n\u201c\u200a\u2018Gonzaga sets forth [the] established method for \nascertaining unambiguous conferral\u2019 of individual \nrights.\u201d  Id. at 19a (quoting Talevski, 599 U.S. at 183).  \nThat test is satisfied, the court continued, \u201cwhere the \nprovision in question is \u2018phrased in terms of the \npersons benefited\u2019 and contains \u2018rights-creating,\u2019 \nindividual-centric language with an \u2018unmistakable \nfocus on the benefited class.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Ibid. (quoting Talevski, \n599 U.S. at 183 (in turn quoting Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at \n284, 287)).   \nHere, the court of appeals explained, the free-\nchoice-of-provider provision unambiguously confers \nrights on individual Medicaid recipients:  \u201cLike the \ntext at issue in Talevski,\u201d the free-choice-of-provider \nprovision \u201cspeak[s] \u2018in terms of the person benefited,\u2019 \nand ha[s] an \u2018unmistakable focus on the benefited \nclass.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Pet. App. 25a (quoting Talevski, 599 U.S. at \n186).  The free-choice-of-provider provision, the court \nexplained, \u201cfocus[es] on discrete beneficiaries and \nguarantee[s] them a choice\u201d of any qualified medical \nprovider \u201cfree from state interference.\u201d  Ibid.  The \ncourt noted that Talevski \u201cbolstered [its] previous \nconclusion\u201d by providing examples of rights-creating \n\n10 \n \n \n \nlanguage \u201csimilar to the language\u201d in the free-choice-\nof-provider provision.  Ibid.   \nPetitioner had argued that the court of appeals \nshould reverse its prior holdings because its decisions \ncited Blessing and Wilder v. Virginia Hospital Ass\u2019n, \n496 U.S. 498 (1990), and in petitioner\u2019s view, those \ndecisions no longer are good law after Talevski.  Pet. \nApp. 14a.  The court of appeals noted that Talevski did \nnot overrule either decision.  Id. at 22a-23a, 28a.  But \neither way, the court explained, \u201cthe central analysis \nremains the same\u201d \u2013 Talevski made clear that courts \nshould \u201clook primarily to Gonzaga\u201d to determine \nwhether Congress unambiguously conferred an \nindividual right, and the court of appeals\u2019 prior \ndecisions \u201cturned upon\u201d that same analysis and \n\u201crelied heavily on Gonzaga.\u201d  Id. at 23a.   \nThe court of appeals then reiterated its conclusion \nthat \nthe \nMedicaid \nAct \ndoes \nnot \nprovide \na \ncomprehensive enforcement scheme that shows \nCongress\u2019s intent to foreclose private enforcement.  \nPet. App. 32a-33a.  The court noted that petitioner \nhad \u201cnot asked us to revisit this question [i]n this \nappeal.\u201d  Id. at 33a. \nFinally, the court of appeals noted that it is \nundisputed that PPSAT is a qualified and willing \nprovider and that petitioner\u2019s decision to terminate \nPPSAT from South Carolina\u2019s Medicaid program was \nunjustified.  Pet. App. 33a-34a.  The court emphasized \nthat petitioner \u201chas not contested\u201d \u2013 at any time \n\u201cduring the long path of this litigation\u201d \u2013 that PPSAT \n\u201cis professionally qualified to provide the care that the \nplaintiff seeks.\u201d  Id. at 33a.  \nJudge Richardson concurred in the judgment.  Pet. \nApp. 35a-36a (Richardson, J., concurring in the \njudgment).  He agreed that the statute here \u201ccreate[s] \n\n11 \n \n \n \nan individual right enforceable under 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1983,\u201d but suggested this Court provide additional \nguidance on the relevant legal standard.  Id. at 36a \n(Richardson, J., concurring in the judgment).     \nARGUMENT \nPetitioner asks this Court (Pet. 15-16) to grant \ncertiorari to address two questions:  (1) whether the \nMedicaid Act\u2019s free-choice-of-provider provision, 42 \nU.S.C. 1396a(a)(23)(A), is privately enforceable under \n42 U.S.C. 1983, and (2) if so, whether the free-choice-\nof-provider provision allows a state to terminate a \nMedicaid provider for any reason, even if the state \nacknowledges that the provider is professionally \nqualified.  This Court\u2019s review is not warranted on \neither question.   \nOn the first question, the court of appeals \nfaithfully applied this Court\u2019s precedents, including \nTalevski, and its conclusion is consistent with that of \nnearly every court that has considered the issue.  \nPetitioner contends (Pet. 31-32) that the courts of \nappeals need guidance on the appropriate test for \ndetermining whether a federal statute is privately \nenforceable under Section 1983.  But Talevski already \nprovided that guidance; the Court reaffirmed that \ncourts should use its \u201cestablished method\u201d (599 U.S. \nat 183) for deciding whether a provision is privately \nenforceable.  This Court has repeatedly denied \npetitions presenting this first question \u2013 including in \nthis case1 \u2013 and it should do the same here.   \n \n1 Baker v. Planned Parenthood S. Atl., 141 S. Ct. 550 (2020) (No. \n19-1186); Gee v. Planned Parenthood of Gulf Coast, Inc., 139 \nS. Ct. 408 (2018) (No. 17-1492); Andersen v. Planned Parenthood \nof Kan. & Mid-Mo., 139 S. Ct. 638 (2018) (No. 17-1340); Betlach \nv. Planned Parenthood Ariz., Inc., 571 U.S. 1198 (2014) (No. 13-\n \n\n12 \n \n \n \nThis case does not present the second question, \nbecause that question concerns whether a patient has \na right to choose an unqualified provider, and \npetitioner has conceded throughout this litigation \nthat PPSAT is a qualified provider.  Further, \npetitioner presented no argument on this issue to the \ndistrict court on summary judgment or to the court of \nappeals in two rounds of briefing on appeal from that \ndecision.  He accordingly has forfeited any argument \nbased on that question.  Even if the question were \npresented here, petitioner\u2019s argument is mistaken, \nand no circuit split exists.  Further review therefore is \nunwarranted.      \nI. \nTHE PRIVATE-RIGHT-OF-ACTION ISSUE \nDOES NOT WARRANT THIS COURT\u2019S \nREVIEW \nPetitioner contends (Pet. 17-32) that the Medicaid \nAct\u2019s \nfree-choice-of-provider \nprovision, \n42 \nU.S.C. 1396a(a)(23)(A), is not privately enforceable \nunder 42 U.S.C. 1983.  He is wrong, and the issue does \nnot warrant the Court\u2019s review.  \nA. The court of appeals\u2019 decision is correct. \n1. Section 1983 authorizes \u201cany citizen of the \nUnited States or other person within [its] jurisdiction\u201d \nto sue any person who, \u201cunder color of\u201d state law, \n\u201cdepriv[ed]\u201d him or her \u201cof any rights, privileges, or \nimmunities secured by\u201d federal law.  42 U.S.C. 1983.  \nA person deprived of a right created by a federal \nstatute by a state actor may sue under Section 1983.  \nSee Maine v. Thiboutot, 448 U.S. 1, 4 (1980). \n \n621); Secretary of Ind. Fam. & Soc. Servs. Admin. v. Planned \nParenthood of Ind., Inc., 569 U.S. 1004 (2013) (No. 12-1039). \n\n13 \n \n \n \nThe federal statute at issue here gives a Medicaid \npatient the right to obtain care from the qualified and \nwilling provider of his or her choice.  It states:  \nA State plan for medical assistance must  *  *  *  \nprovide that  *  *  *  any individual eligible for \nmedical assistance  *  *  *  may obtain such \nassistance from any institution  *  *  *  qualified \nto perform the service or services required  \n*  *  *  [that] undertakes to provide him such \nservices.  \n42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(23)(A).   \nCongress enacted this provision to ensure that \nMedicaid recipients, like other individuals, could \nmake deeply personal choices about where to obtain \nmedical care without states \u201crestricting beneficiaries \nto certain providers.\u201d  Pet. App. 6a; see, e.g., S. Rep. \nNo. 744, 90th Cong., 1st Sess. 183 (1967).  Congress \nthen reiterated the importance of this right in the \nfamily-planning context, providing that even when a \nstate uses a managed-care system, the state cannot \nlimit a patient\u2019s free choice of provider for family-\nplanning services.  See 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(23)(B) \n(cross-reference to 42 U.S.C. 1396d(a)(4)(C)). \n2. In a careful and thorough opinion, the court of \nappeals faithfully applied this Court\u2019s precedents and \ncorrectly concluded that the Medicaid Act\u2019s free-\nchoice-of-provider provision is privately enforceable \nunder Section 1983.  Pet. App. 5a-35a.  All three \njudges agreed that the statute at issue here is \u201cclear \nand \nunambiguous\u201d \nin \nconferring \na \nprivately \nenforceable right.  Id. at 29a; see id. at 36a \n(Richardson, J., concurring in the judgment).  This \nwas not a close call:  The court found it \u201chard to \nconceive of any text  *  *  *  that would permit\u201d a \nprivate right of action \u201c[i]f the language of this \n\n14 \n \n \n \nmedical provider provision does not suffice.\u201d  Id. at \n35a.   \nThe court of appeals began its analysis by carefully \nreviewing this Court\u2019s precedents, including the \nrecent decision in Talevski.  Pet. App. 15a-21a.  \nTalevski applied the Court\u2019s settled precedents to hold \nthat a nursing facility resident could sue under \nSection 1983 to enforce two particular provisions of \nFNHRA.  599 U.S. at 180-191.  In so holding, Talevski \nexplained that \u201c\u200a\u2018Gonzaga sets forth [the] established \nmethod for ascertaining unambiguous conferral\u2019 of \nindividual rights,\u201d and that this test is satisfied \n\u201cwhere the provision in question is \u2018phrased in terms \nof the persons benefited\u2019 and contains \u2018rights-\ncreating,\u2019 \nindividual-centric \nlanguage \nwith \nan \n\u2018unmistakable focus on the benefited class.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Pet. App. \n19a (quoting Talevski, 599 U.S. at 183 (in turn quoting \nGonzaga, 536 U.S. at 284, 287)).  As the court of \nappeals recognized, this Court\u2019s decisions set a \n\u201cdemanding bar\u201d for finding a privately enforceable \nright.  Id. at 22a (quoting Talevski, 599 U.S. at 180). \nApplying that guidance, the court of appeals \ncorrectly concluded that the free-choice-of-provider \nprovision is privately enforceable.  The court \n\u201crigorously examine[d]\u201d the statutory text and \nconcluded that it unambiguously gives Medicaid \npatients an individual right to obtain care from their \nprovider of choice.  Pet. App. 22a, 25a.  The statute \nspecifically defines the intended class of beneficiaries \n(\u201cany individual  *  *  *  eligible for medical assistance\u201d \nunder Medicaid) and gives them a particular right \n(the right to \u201cobtain [care] from any\u201d qualified \nprovider). \n \nId. \nat \n23a \n(quoting \n42 \nU.S.C. \n1396a(a)(23)(A); emphasis omitted).   \nThat language is \u201ca prime example of the kind of \n\u2018rights-creating\u2019 language required to confer a \n\n15 \n \n \n \npersonal right on a discrete class of persons.\u201d  Pet. \nApp. 25a-26a (discussing Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at 284 \nn.3).  It \u201cspeak[s] in terms of the persons benefited and \nha[s] an unmistakable focus on the benefited class.\u201d  \nId. at 25a (quoting Talevski, 599 U.S. at 186).  Indeed, \nthe court explained, Talevski \u201cbolstered\u201d the court\u2019s \nprior conclusion on this point \u201cby providing additional \nexamples of rights-creating language similar to the \nlanguage at issue here.\u201d  Ibid.  \nFurther, the court of appeals found no indication \nin the statutory text that Congress intended to \nforeclose a Section 1983 remedy.  Pet. App. 32a-33a.  \nThere is no \u201cincompatibility between enforcement \nunder \u00a7 1983 and the enforcement scheme that \nCongress has enacted.\u201d  Id. at 32a (quoting Talevski, \n599 U.S. at 187).  That is particularly true, the court \nexplained, because \u201cthere is no way for Medicaid \nbeneficiaries to challenge disqualifications of their \npreferred providers through the administrative \nscheme.\u201d  Ibid.2  Notably, petitioner did not contest \nthis point in the court of appeals.  The court previously \nhad held that \u201cthe Medicaid Act provides no \ncomprehensive enforcement scheme sufficient to \novercome the presumption that the free-choice-of-\nprovider provision is enforceable under \u00a7 1983,\u201d id. at \n32a (quoting id. at 102a), and \u201cSouth Carolina d[id] \n \n2 Petitioner asserts in passing (Pet. 9) that PPSAT was required \nto exhaust state administrative remedies.  But patients such as \nMs. Edwards \u2013 the people with the free-choice-of-provider right \n\u2013 cannot participate in this administrative review process.  And \neven if Ms. Edwards could use that process, both the district \ncourt and court of appeals found that doing so would be \u201cfutile.\u201d  \nPet. App. 101a n.4.  Besides, it is well-established that a person \nis not required to exhaust administrative remedies before filing \nsuit under Section 1983.  Patsy v. Board of Regents of State of \nFla., 457 U.S. 496, 516 (1982); see Pet. App. 101a n.4.   \n\n16 \n \n \n \nnot ask\u201d the court \u201cto revisit this question [i]n this \nappeal,\u201d id. at 33a.  \n3. Petitioner offers two main criticisms of the \ncourt of appeals\u2019 decision.  Pet. 30-32, 36-37.  Neither \nhas merit.  \nFirst, petitioner argues (Pet. 36-37) that the court \nof appeals erred in reading the free-choice-of-provider \nprovision to create an unambiguously conferred right.  \nHe contends (ibid.) that the free-choice-of-provider \nprovision lacks rights-creating language, comparing it \nto the provision in Gonzaga that \u201csp[oke] only in terms \nof institutional policy and practice, not individual[s].\u201d  \n536 U.S. at 288 (discussing 20 U.S.C. 1232g(b)(1)-(2)).  \nThat comparison is inapt.  Whereas the provision in \nGonzaga concerned only institutional \u201cpolic[ies] or \npractice[s],\u201d 20 U.S.C. 1232g(b)(1)-(2), the free-choice-\nof-provider provision addresses whether \u201cindividual\u201d \nMedicaid patients \u201cmay obtain\u201d \u201cmedical assistance\u201d \nfrom \ntheir \nchosen \nproviders, \n42 \nU.S.C. \n1396a(a)(23)(A). \nPetitioner also notes (Pet. 36-37) that the free-\nchoice-of-provider provision does not contain the word \n\u201cright.\u201d  Yet there is no basis for petitioner\u2019s \u201cmagic \nwords\u201d rule.  Pet. App. 26a (quoting Federal Aviation \nAdmin. v. Copper, 566 U.S. 284, 291 (2012)).  The free-\nchoice-of-provider provision has an \u201cunmistakable \nfocus\u201d on the benefited class and is \u201cphrased in terms \nof the persons benefited,\u201d which \u201csatisfie[s]\u201d this \nCourt\u2019s test for whether a statute contains the \nnecessary rights-creating language.  Talevski, 599 \nU.S. at 183. \nSecond, petitioner argues (Pet. 30-31, 35-36) that \nthe court of appeals erred by putting too much weight \non this Court\u2019s decisions in Blessing and Wilder.  That \nis mistaken.  The court of appeals recognized that \n\n17 \n \n \n \n\u201c\u200a\u2018Gonzaga sets forth [the] established method for \nascertaining unambiguous conferral\u2019 of individual \nrights.\u201d  Id. at 19a (quoting Talevski, 599 U.S. at 183).  \nThe court then correctly stated and applied that test, \nexplaining that, for a statutory provision to be \nprivately enforceable, it must unambiguously confer \nan individual right on a particular class of people, and \nit must not include a comprehensive enforcement \nscheme showing a congressional intent to preclude \nprivate enforcement.  Pet. App. 24a-31a, 32a.  \nFurther, the court correctly noted that this Court has \nnot overruled Blessing.  Id. at 22a-23a.  Indeed, as the \ncourt noted (id. at 31a), both Gonzaga and Talevski \ncited Blessing.  See Talevski, 599 U.S. at 189; \nGonzaga, 536 U.S. at 287-289.   \nFar from changing the standard for determining \nwhether a federal law secures rights for Section 1983 \npurposes, the Court in Talevski stated that it was \napplying its \u201cestablished method for ascertaining \nunambiguous conferral\u201d to the federal statute at issue \nin that case.  599 U.S. at 183; see id. at 184-186.  The \ncourt of appeals likewise recognized that, throughout \nthis Court\u2019s line of decisions, the \u201ccentral inquiry\u201d has \nremained the same \u2013 \u201cwhether Congress conferred a \nclear and unambiguous right upon a discrete class of \nbeneficiaries.\u201d  Pet. App. 21a.  The court of appeals \nexplained that this analysis \u201cremains the same\u201d \u201cwith \nor without Blessing,\u201d id. at 23a, and it did not even \ncite Blessing in evaluating whether the free-choice-of-\nprovider provision is enforceable under Section 1983, \nsee id. at 24a-33a.  Instead, as in its prior decisions, it \nfocused on Gonzaga.  Id. at 23a-26a.  Petitioner is \n\n18 \n \n \n \ntherefore wrong to criticize the court of appeals for its \nbrief citations to Blessing.3  \nPetitioner likewise is wrong to say (Pet. 31, 35) \nthat the court of appeals improperly relied on Wilder.  \nThe court cited Wilder only for a narrow proposition \u2013 \nthat a provision in the Medicaid Act can create a \nprivately enforceable right.  Pet. App. 27a, 32a.  That \nis just a statement of the holding in Wilder.  Id. at 27a \n(citing Wilder, 496 U.S. at 509-510 (holding that the \nBoren Amendment is privately enforceable under \nSection 1983)).  That holding has never been called \ninto question by this Court.  In fact, the Court \n\u201capprovingly cited Wilder on this point\u201d in City of \nRancho Palos Verdes v. Abrams, 544 U.S. 113, 122 \n(2005).  Pet. App. 62a.   \nThis Court has questioned other parts of Wilder, \nbut the court of appeals recognized that, stating that \nthis Court has \u201cnoted  * * *  that \u2018[its] later opinions \nplainly repudiate the ready implication of a \u00a7 1983 \naction that Wilder exemplified\u2019\u201d and \u201cexpressly \n\u2018reject[ed] the notion,\u2019 implicit in Wilder, \u2018that [its] \ncases permit anything short of an unambiguously \nconferred right.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Pet. App. 27a-28a (quoting \nArmstrong, 575 U.S. at 330 n.*).   \n \n3  Notably, earlier in this case, petitioner took a different \nposition from the one he takes now; he actually relied on Blessing \nas providing the relevant legal standard.  For example, in his \nappeal of the preliminary injunction, petitioner argued that a \nstatute can give rise to a right enforceable through Section 1983 \nif the factors identified by this Court in Blessing are satisfied.  \nSee, e.g., Pet. C.A. Prelim. Inj. Br. 22-23, No. 18-2133 (4th Cir. \nNov. 26, 2018) (arguing that a plaintiff must \u201cmeet all  * * *  of \nthe[] requirements\u201d from Blessing for \u201ca \u00a7 1983 claim [to] lie\u201d); \nPet. C.A. Prelim. Inj. Reply Br. 3-10, No. 18-2133 (4th Cir. Feb. \n4, 2019) (similar).  This is reason to doubt petitioner\u2019s claimed \nneed for clarification about Blessing.    \n\n19 \n \n \n \nIn any event, the court of appeals explained that \npetitioner\u2019s arguments failed even if he were correct \nthat all of Wilder had been abrogated, because \nTalevski also \u201crejected the argument that provisions \nthat speak to and place obligations on government \nofficials [like the Medicaid Act] cannot create \nindividual rights.\u201d  Id. at 28a; see ibid. (\u201c[E]ven if \n[Wilder were] abrogated  * * *  the State\u2019s argument \nremains unpersuasive.\u201d).  Again, with or without \nWilder, the analysis and outcome remain the same.  \nMore generally, petitioner overstates the supposed \nneed for clarification about the status of Blessing and \nWilder.  The Court had the opportunity to provide \nguidance in Talevski, and it did so, explaining that \nGonzaga provides the relevant test, and that this test \nreflects \nthe \nCourt\u2019s \n\u201cestablished \nmethod \nfor \nascertaining unambiguous conferral\u201d of an individual \nright.  599 U.S. at 183.  All three judges of the court of \nappeals understood that the \u201ccentral inquiry\u201d was \nwhether Congress unambiguously conferred an \nindividual right on Medicaid patients, and all three \njudges agreed that Congress did that here.  Pet. App. \n31a, 35a; see id. at 36a (Richardson, J., concurring in \nthe judgment).  Under those circumstances, there is \nno need for this Court\u2019s review, particularly because \nthis Court \u201creviews judgments, not statements in \nopinions.\u201d  Black v. Cutter Labs., 351 U.S. 292, 297 \n(1956); see Camreta v. Greene, 563 U.S. 692, 704 \n(2011) (This Court\u2019s \u201cresources are not well spent \nsuperintending each word a lower court utters en \nroute to a final judgment.\u201d). \nB. Any differences in the approaches of the courts \nof appeals do not warrant this Court\u2019s review. \n1. Nearly every court of appeals that has \nconsidered the issue has held that the Medicaid Act\u2019s \nfree-choice-of-provider \nprovision, \n42 \nU.S.C. \n\n20 \n \n \n \n1396a(a)(23)(A), \nis \nprivately \nenforceable \nunder \nSection 1983.4  And nearly every district court that \nhas considered the issue has agreed with that \nconclusion.5 \n \n4 See Planned Parenthood of Kan. & Mid-Mo. v.

Id. at 357-358. \nThe Fifth Circuit stated that it is \u201cnot clear\u201d that \nthe Fourth Circuit would disagree with its holding, \nbecause that holding was premised on Texas \ndisqualifying the providers based on specific factual \nfindings of a state administrative agency, whereas \nSouth Carolina did not claim any health or safety \nbasis for disqualifying PPSAT.  Kauffman, 981 F.3d at \n365.  Indeed, as the court of appeals here explained, \nSouth Carolina has never contested, \u201cduring the long \npath of this litigation, that Planned Parenthood is \nprofessionally qualified to provide the care that the \nplaintiff seeks.\u201d  Pet. App. 33a.  The Fifth Circuit \ndistinguished private-right-of-action holdings from \nthree other courts of appeals on similar grounds.  \nKauffman, 981 F.3d at 365, 367.   \nThe Eighth Circuit\u2019s decision in Does v. Gillespie, \n867 F.3d 1034 (8th Cir. 2017), is distinguishable for \nthe same reason.  In that case, the Arkansas \nDepartment of Human Services terminated the \nprovider\u2019s participation in the state\u2019s Medicaid \nprogram \u201cfor cause\u201d based on ostensible \u201cevidence [of\u200a] \nunethical\u201d action and \u201cwrongful conduct.\u201d  Id. at 1038.  \nLike the Fifth Circuit, the Eighth Circuit had no \nreason to address whether a patient may challenge \nthe termination of a provider\u2019s Medicaid contract \nwhen the provider\u2019s professional qualifications are \nundisputed. \nFurther, the Eighth Circuit\u2019s decision relied on an \nanalysis that has been foreclosed by Talevski.  That \ncourt did not use the test set out by this Court, which \nfocuses on whether the specific language at issue \nincludes the necessary \u201crights-creating language.\u201d  \n\n23 \n \n \n \nTalevski, 599 U.S. at 183 (quoting Gonzaga, 536 U.S. \nat 290).  Rather than analyze the specific text of 42 \nU.S.C. 1396a(a)(23)(A), the court treated the mere \npossibility of federal enforcement as precluding \nprivate enforcement, Gillespie, 867 F.3d at 1041, a \nview that Talevski expressly rejected, 599 U.S. at 186-\n192.   \nThe Eighth Circuit also focused on the fact that the \nprovision exists within a set of requirements for state \nMedicaid plans.  Gillespie, 867 F.3d at 1041.  But \nTalevski rejected that reasoning as well, explaining \n(in the context of a similar statute) that it is wrong to \nsay that provisions that impose obligations on third \nparties cannot create individual rights.  599 U.S. at \n185.  Further, as the court of appeals noted (Pet. App. \n29a), the Medicaid Act itself refutes that reasoning, \nbecause it expressly instructs that a provision of the \nAct \u201cis not to be deemed unenforceable because of its \ninclusion in a section of [the Act]  * * *  specifying the \nrequired contents of a State plan.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 1320a-2.   \nFinally, the Eighth Circuit\u2019s decision in Gillespie is \nout of step with its own precedent, because in other \nprivate-right-of-action cases, that court has faithfully \napplied Gonzaga.  See, e.g., Spectra Commc\u2019ns Grp. v. \nCity of Cameron, Mo., 806 F.3d 1113, 1120 (8th Cir. \n2015); Lankford v. Sherman, 451 F.3d 496, 508-509 \n(8th Cir. 2006).  The Eighth Circuit should have an \nopportunity to reconsider its analysis in Gillespie in \nlight of these decisions and in light of the guidance \nthis Court provided in Talevski. \n3. There is no urgent need for this Court\u2019s review.  \nContrary to petitioner\u2019s suggestion (Pet. 35-37), the \nquestion presented does not arise frequently.  Since \nthe first appellate decision permitting enforcement of \nthe free-choice-of-provider provision under Section \n1983 (the Sixth Circuit\u2019s decision in Harris in March \n\n24 \n \n \n \n2006), respondents are aware of only twelve district \ncourt decisions involving lawsuits challenging the \ntermination of Medicaid providers through the free-\nchoice-of-provider provision and Section 1983, see \nnote 5, supra (first twelve cases), plus a handful of \ncases challenging other state policies or actions using \nthose statutes, see, e.g., ibid. (next six cases).  All but \nthree of the twelve cases were efforts by states to \ntarget Planned Parenthood in ways courts have \nrecognized \nare \nunwarranted \nand \npolitically \nmotivated.  See, e.g., Bader v. Wernert, 178 F. Supp. \n3d 703, 724 (N.D. Ind. 2016).  They involved \npretextual termination attempts lacking any legal \nbasis or evidentiary support.   \nFurther, the issue has arisen less and less \nfrequently in recent years.  Outside of this case, no \ncourt of appeals has addressed the question presented \nsince 2020.  See note 4, supra.  The small and \ndecreasing number of these cases shows that \npetitioner is wrong to say (Pet. 35) that the court of \nappeals\u2019 decision will lead to additional litigation.  \nThis Court has denied certiorari on this issue multiple \ntimes, see note 1, supra, and the passage of time has \nmade it even more clear that there is no need for this \nCourt\u2019s review.  \nIf this Court potentially were interested in \nconsidering this issue, it should first give the courts of \nappeals the opportunity to consider its recent \nguidance in Talevski.  Only the court of appeals in the \ndecision below \u2013 and no other court \u2013 has had the \nopportunity to consider the effect of Talevski on the \nquestion whether the free-choice-of-provider provision \nconfers a right enforceable under Section 1983.  In \nlight of the decreasing number of cases raising this \nissue, there may never be a need for this Court\u2019s \nreview.  But if petitioner is correct and this remains a \n\n25 \n \n \n \nlive issue, then this Court will have other \nopportunities to consider the issue after other courts \nof appeals have applied the guidance in Talevski. \nII. THE \nUNQUALIFIED-PROVIDER \nISSUE \nDOES NOT WARRANT THIS COURT\u2019S \nREVIEW  \nPetitioner contends (Pet. 33-34) that if the \nMedicaid \nAct\u2019s \nfree-choice-of-provider \nprovision \nconfers an individual right enforceable under Section \n1983, this Court should grant review to decide \nwhether that right extends to providers that a state \nhas labeled \u201c[un]qualified.\u201d  This case does not present \nthat question, because petitioner has conceded \nthroughout the course of this litigation that PPSAT is \na qualified provider.  Further, petitioner forfeited this \nargument by abandoning it in his most recent appeal.  \nThe argument also is mistaken, and there is no \ndisagreement in the courts of appeals on this point.      \nA. Petitioner is wrong to say (Pet. 33) that Ms. \nEdwards is seeking to challenge the exclusion of an \nunqualified provider.  Petitioner in fact has conceded \nat every turn that PPSAT is qualified. \nAs the court of appeals recognized, \u201c[t]here has \nnever been any question during the long path of this \nlitigation that Planned Parenthood is professionally \nqualified to provide the care that plaintiff seeks.\u201d  Pet. \nApp. 33a.  Since the beginning, petitioner has not \ncontested that PPSAT is a qualified provider.  See id. \nat 107a (first court of appeals decision:  \u201cSouth \nCarolina does not contest the fact that PPSAT is \nprofessionally qualified to deliver the services that the \nindividual plaintiff seeks.\u201d); id. at 74a (second court of \nappeals decision:  \u201c[T]here is no dispute as to whether \n[petitioner] asserts PPSAT afforded less than \nadequate care to its patients.  He does not.\u201d); id. at 33a \n\n26 \n \n \n \n(third court of appeals decision:  \u201c\u200aThe State has not \ncontested\u201d \u201cthat Planned Parenthood is professionally \nqualified to provide the care that the plaintiff seeks.\u201d).   \nB. Petitioner has forfeited any argument about \n\u201cthe scope of any alleged right to challenge a state\u2019s \ndisqualification decision\u201d (Pet. 33).  Petitioner made \nan argument along those lines at the preliminary-\ninjunction stage; he argued that he did not violate the \nfree-choice-of-provider provision because a state may \nexclude providers as not \u201c\u200a\u2018qualified\u2019  *  *  *  based on \nany conceivable state interest.\u201d  Pet. App. 109a \n(quoting 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(23)(A)).  Among other \nthings, petitioner relied on O\u2019Bannon v. Town Court \nNursing Center, 447 U.S. 773 (1980).  Pet. App. 111a-\n112a.  But petitioner \u201cd[id] not contest the fact that \nPPSAT is professionally qualified to deliver the \nservices that [Ms. Edwards] seeks.\u201d  Id. at 107a.  The \ndistrict court and court of appeals accordingly rejected \npetitioner\u2019s argument and held that he violated the \nfree-choice-of-provider provision.  Id. at 138a-141a, \n106a-117a.   \nAfter the preliminary-injunction stage, petitioner \nfocused exclusively on the private-right-of-action \nquestion.  On summary judgment in the district court \nand in two rounds of briefing in the court of appeals, \npetitioner argued only that the free-choice-of-provider \nprovision does not give rise to a privately enforceable \nright.  For example, in opposing summary judgment, \npetitioner argued that 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(23)(A) \u201cdoes \nnot authorize a private right of action\u201d for the reasons \n\u201cset forth\u201d in his preliminary-injunction brief.  Pet. D. \nCt. Summ. J. Br. 9, No. 18-cv-2078 (D.S.C. Feb. 24, \n2020).  Petitioner did not argue in the alternative that \nif Section 1983 confers a privately enforceable right, \nhe did not violate that right.  \n\n27 \n \n \n \nThen, on appeal of the summary-judgment \ndecision, petitioner again assumed that PPSAT is \n\u201cqualified\u201d within the meaning of the free-choice-of-\nprovider provision, rather than argue that he did not \nviolate the statute.  See Pet. C.A. Br. 22-30, No. 21-\n1043 (4th Cir. Mar. 29, 2021) (21-1043 Pet. C.A. Br.).  \nIndeed, the court of appeals found it \u201c[n]otabl[e]\u201d that \npetitioner \u201cd[id] not challenge the district court\u2019s \ndetermination (and [the court of appeals\u2019] own \nprevious conclusion) that South Carolina violated this \nprovision.\u201d  Pet. App. 51a n.1.  Petitioner only cited \nO\u2019Bannon for the proposition that the free-choice-of-\nprovider provision is not privately enforceable, id. at \n62a-64a; see 21-1043 Pet. C.A. Br. 22-27; he did not \nseparately argue that his termination of PPSAT\u2019s \nMedicaid participation was justified under O\u2019Bannon.   \nFinally, in his supplemental briefs following \nTalevski, petitioner did not even cite O\u2019Bannon, \ninstead addressing only the private-right-of-action \nissue and arguing that Talevski required the court of \nappeals to reverse its previous holding that the free-\nchoice-of-provider provision is enforceable under \nSection 1983.  Pet. Supp. C.A. Br. 4-16, No. 21-1043 \n(4th Cir. Aug. 23, 2023); Pet. Supp. C.A. Reply Br. 2-\n10, No. 21-1043 (4th Cir. Oct. 13, 2023). \nThe court of appeals did not address petitioner\u2019s \nargument about the scope of the free-choice-of-\nprovider right in 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(23)(A) in the \nsecond appeal because petitioner never presented that \nargument.  This Court should not address the \nargument in the first instance.  See, e.g., Cutter v. \nWilkinson, 544 U.S. 709, 718 n.7 (2005) (\u201c[W]e are a \ncourt of review, not of first view.\u201d).   \nC. To be sure, petitioner\u2019s forfeited argument is \nwrong.  A state may not terminate a provider from \nMedicaid for any reason and then \u201csimply label[]\u201d that \n\n28 \n \n \n \n\u201cexclusionary rule as a \u2018qualification\u2019\u200a\u201d under the free-\nchoice-of-provider provision.  Pet. App. 110a.  The \n\u201cordinary \ndefinition \nof \n\u2018qualified\u2019 \n[is] \nbeing \nprofessionally capable or competent.\u201d  Id. at 107a-\n108a.  Congress adopted that meaning when it \nspecified that \u201cqualified\u201d means \u201cqualified to perform \nthe \nservice \nor \nservices \nrequired.\u201d \n \n42 \nU.S.C. 1396a(a)(23)(A); \nsee \nFederal \nCommc\u2019ns \nComm\u2019n v. AT & T Inc., 562 U.S. 397, 405 (2011) \n(\u201c[W]hen interpreting a statute  *  *  *  we construe \nlanguage  *  *  *  in light of the terms surrounding it.\u201d).   \nA provider \u201cis not made unqualified to perform\u201d \nmedical services \u201cbased on any conceivable state \ninterest.\u201d  Pet. App. 109a.  Instead, a state may \n\u201cconsider[]\u201d a provider not to be \u201cqualified\u201d based only \non the \u201cstandards for the provision of care\u201d that the \nstate has \u201cset.\u201d  S. Rep. No. 744, 90th Cong., 1st Sess. \n183.  Here, South Carolina agreed that PPSAT meets \nthose standards and is professionally capable of \nproviding the care that Ms. Edwards seeks.  See Pet. \nApp. 33a, 58a, 98a n.3, 107a.  South Carolina\u2019s \nargument that \u201cthe term \u2018qualified\u2019 means whatever \nthe state says,\u201d if accepted, \u201cwould strip the free-\nchoice-of-provider provision of all meaning\u201d and would \n\u201ceviscerate the Medicaid Act\u2019s cooperative scheme.\u201d  \nId. at 110a, 116a.   \nD. Finally, and in any event, there is no circuit \nsplit on the unqualified-provider issue.  Petitioner \ncontends (Pet. 33-34) that the Fourth, Seventh, and \nTenth Circuits disagree with the Fifth Circuit on \nwhether O\u2019Bannon holds that the free-choice-of-\nprovider provision does not confer a right to obtain \ncare from a provider that a state has deemed \ndisqualified.  That is incorrect, because the Fifth \nCircuit considered the termination of providers for \ncause, whereas the Fourth, Seventh, and Tenth \n\n29 \n \n \n \nCircuits considered terminations of providers without \ncause.  The different outcomes in the cases are \nexplained by their different facts.    \nSpecifically, O\u2019Bannon rejected nursing home \nresidents\u2019 attempt to challenge the termination of an \nunqualified provider.  447 U.S. at 776-777 & nn.3-4, \n785.  Here, the parties agreed that PPSAT is a \nmedically qualified provider.  The same was true in \nthe Seventh and Tenth Circuit cases.  See Planned \nParenthood of Kan. & Mid-Mo., 882 F.3d at 1236; \nPlanned Parenthood of Ind., 699 F.3d at 978-80.  In \nthat circumstance, O\u2019Bannon said that the patient \ndoes have a right \u201cto choose among a range of qualified \nproviders, without government interference.\u201d  447 \nU.S. at 785; see id. at 785 n.18.  So if O\u2019Bannon applies \nhere, it leads to different results in these different \ncases because they involved different facts.  For that \nreason as well, further review is unwarranted.    \n\n30 \n \n \n \nCONCLUSION \nThe petition for a writ of certiorari should be \ndenied. \nRespectfully submitted. \n \nJENNIFER SANDMAN\nPlanned Parenthood \nFederation of America \n123 William Street \nNew York, NY 10038 \n \nHANNAH SWANSON \nPlanned Parenthood \nFederation of America  \n1110 Vermont Avenue NW, \nSuite 300 \nWashington, DC 20005 \n \n \nNICOLE A.

          "task_beliefs": "The successful retrieval and analysis of the Petitioner's merits brief provides a comprehensive view of their arguments, dramatically increasing my confidence in the predicted outcome and refining my understanding of the specific legal terrain.\n\n1.  **Core Legal Question & Controlling Test (Stable, Dominant Interpretation):** My understanding remains stable: the case hinges on whether 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a(a)(23)(A) contains \"unambiguously\" rights-creating language under the *Gonzaga*/*Talevski* standard. The Petitioner's brief confirms this is the entire battleground.\n2.  **Petitioner's Argumentative Framework (Now Fully Mapped and Extremely Strong):** I now have a complete and detailed map of the Petitioner's arguments, which are even stronger and more tailored to the current Court than anticipated.\n    *   **The Proposed Bright-Line Rule:** The Petitioner's central argument is a proposed bright-line rule: for a Spending Clause statute to create a private right of action, it must either (a) explicitly use the word \"right\" (as in *Talevski*), or (b) use text borrowed from rights-creating provisions of the U.S. Constitution (as in Title IX cases). This is a simple, powerful, and textualist-friendly test that this provision\u2014\"a State plan...must...provide that...any individual...may obtain such assistance\"\u2014clearly fails.\n    *   **Direct Contrast with *Talevski*:** The brief masterfully contrasts the provision at issue with the statute in *Talevski*. It highlights that the *Talevski* provisions were explicitly labeled a \"bill of rights\" for residents and used the term \"right\" repeatedly (e.g., \"right to be free from,\" \"discharge rights\"). The current provision is structurally located in a generic list of 87 administrative \"Contents\" for a state plan.\n    *   **The \"Off-Ramp\" Strategy:** The Petitioner strategically asks the Court not to *overrule* older, more lenient precedents like *Wilder v. Virginia Hospital Association*, but to formally \"clarify\" that they have been \"cabined\" and that the stricter *Gonzaga* test is now the exclusive standard. This makes it easier for the Court to rule in their favor without appearing to disrupt stare decisis.\n    *   **Structural and Separation-of-Powers Arguments:** The brief heavily reinforces the structural argument (previously seen in the SG's brief) that the sole remedy Congress provided for non-compliance is the withholding of federal funds by the Secretary of HHS (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396c). Allowing private lawsuits, they argue, would be a judicial usurpation of this executive enforcement power and would disrupt the \"cooperative federalism\" balance.\n3.  **Respondent's Position (Stable, Significantly Weakened, Facing a Formidable Challenge):** My understanding of the Respondent's arguments is still based on their earlier Brief in Opposition. However, the Petitioner's merits brief clarifies the immense challenge they now face. They must convince the Court to reject the Petitioner's clear bright-line rule and argue that the phrase \"may obtain\" is sufficiently \"rights-creating\" on its own, despite its structural context and the lack of explicit rights language. The Expected Information Gain (EIG) of their forthcoming merits brief is now exceptionally high, as it must rebut this powerful, multi-pronged attack.\n4.  **The U.S. Government's Position (Dominant Signal, Reinforced):** The SG's amicus brief remains a critical signal. The Petitioner's brief has adopted, expanded, and sharpened the SG's core structural arguments, presenting a powerful united front against the private right of action.\n5.  **The Government's Change in Position (Stable Context):** This remains a key piece of the case's history, illustrating the doctrinal shift post-*Talevski*, but the legal arguments presented in the Petitioner's brief are the primary driver of the predicted outcome.\n6.  **Updated State of Uncertainty (Extremely Low):** My confidence in a ruling for the Petitioner (South Carolina) is now extremely high. The Petitioner's arguments are exceptionally well-aligned with the jurisprudential approach of the Court's current majority. The primary remaining uncertainty is no longer the outcome, but the precise reasoning the majority will adopt. Specifically, will the Court explicitly adopt the Petitioner's proposed two-part bright-line test for rights-creating language?",
          "design_beliefs": "This observation provides a masterclass in modern Supreme Court advocacy, leading to the refinement of existing heuristics and the creation of new, more sophisticated ones.\n\n1.  **\"Petitioner-First\" Heuristic:** Confirmed. Analyzing the Petitioner's merits brief is essential for understanding the primary lines of attack and the framework the respondent must counter.\n2.  **\"The *Talevski* Litmus Test\" (Refined to \"Apply *Talevski* via Comparison\"):** Confirmed and significantly refined. The most effective way to apply *Talevski* is not just to cite its holding, but to perform a direct, side-by-side textual and structural comparison between the statute in that case and the statute in the current case. The Petitioner's brief demonstrates this is the dispositive method.\n3.  **\"Precedent Bracketing\":** Confirmed and validated as a core analytical strategy. The Petitioner's argument successfully brackets the issue, positioning this case as textually and structurally analogous to *Gonzaga* (no right) and distinct from *Talevski* (right).\n4.  **Refined Source Prioritization:** Confirmed. The Petitioner's merits brief is a Tier-1, indispensable source, on par with the SG's amicus brief in a federal statutory case.\n5.  **\"The Meta-Cognitive Loop\" & \"Conscious EIG Targeting\":** Strongly validated. My previous step correctly identified the Respondent's merits brief as the next key document. This successful search for the Petitioner's brief now makes the EIG of the Respondent's brief even higher, as the questions it must answer are now sharply defined.\n6.  **\"BIO as Merits Blueprint\":** This holds, but the caveat is now critical: intervening events (like the SG's brief) and the full development of the Petitioner's arguments can force the Respondent to pivot dramatically from their initial arguments in the BIO.\n7.  **\"Track Changes in Position\":** Confirmed.\n8.  **\"Structural Arguments Can Trump Beneficiary-Focus Arguments\":** Massively reinforced. The Petitioner's brief is a powerful demonstration that arguments about the overall statutory scheme, enforcement mechanisms, and placement of a provision can defeat arguments focused on the provision's intended beneficiaries.\n9.  **\"Amicus Briefs as Signals\":** Confirmed, with the SG's brief remaining the most powerful signal, now shown to be a blueprint for the Petitioner's own arguments.\n10. **\"Prioritize the SG's View in Federal Statutory Cases\":** Confirmed.\n11. **\"Argumentative Framing is Key\":** Confirmed. The Petitioner's framing of the issue in terms of separation of powers and cooperative federalism is a powerful appeal to the Court's majority.\n12. **\"Table of Authorities as a Map\":** Confirmed. The ToA accurately predicted the focus on *Gonzaga* and *Talevski* and signaled the strategy of cabining *Wilder* and *Wright*.\n13. **\"The Reflective Pause (THINK Step)\":** Reinforced.\n14. **\"Verify Search Results and Distinguish Document Types\":** Remains a crucial, validated heuristic from the previous step.\n15. **\"Account for Litigation Timing\":** Remains a crucial, validated heuristic. The successful retrieval of this brief suggests it was filed in the time since my last search, confirming that information gathering must align with the Court's filing schedule.\n16. **NEW Heuristic: \"Look for the 'Off-Ramp' Argument.\"** Sophisticated briefs often provide the Court with a method to reach the desired result without causing a major precedential disruption. Identifying arguments that ask the Court to \"clarify,\" \"distinguish,\" or \"cabin\" (rather than \"overrule\") is key to predicting the path of least resistance for a majority opinion.\n17. **NEW Heuristic: \"Identify Proposed 'Bright-Line Rules'.\"** When a party proposes a simple, clear, judicially manageable test, it has a high chance of being adopted by a Court that values textualism and clear rules over multi-factor balancing tests. The Petitioner's two-part test for \"rights-creating language\" is a prime example. Identifying these is a strong predictive tool."

          "task_beliefs": "The failure to retrieve the Respondent's merits brief leaves my core prediction unchanged but highlights the specific information gap that represents the last major piece of the puzzle.\n\n1.  **Core Legal Question & Controlling Test (Stable, Dominant Interpretation):** My understanding remains firm: the case turns on whether 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a(a)(23)(A) has \"unambiguously\" rights-creating language under the *Gonzaga*/*Talevski* framework. The Petitioner's brief has cemented this as the central issue.\n2.  **Petitioner's Argumentative Framework (Stable, Dominant):** My detailed map of the Petitioner's arguments remains the foundation of my prediction. Their proposed bright-line rule (requiring the word \"right\" or text from a constitutional source), their direct textual/structural comparison to *Talevski*, their \"off-ramp\" strategy to cabin rather than overrule precedent, and their powerful separation-of-powers arguments create a formidable case that is highly aligned with the current Court's jurisprudence.\n3.  **Respondent's Position (Uncertainty Persists):** The attempted search for the Respondent's merits brief failed, returning only the previously analyzed Brief in Opposition. This is a null result in terms of new arguments, but it confirms that this key piece of information is not yet available. My understanding of their position is therefore still based on the older BIO. The central uncertainty remains: how will the Respondents counter the Petitioner's powerful, multi-pronged attack? They must do more than simply re-assert that the language is rights-creating; they must now directly rebut the Petitioner's proposed bright-line rule and structural arguments. The Expected Information Gain from their merits brief remains exceptionally high.\n4.  **The U.S. Government's Position (Stable, Reinforced Signal):** The SG's amicus brief, which provided the blueprint for the Petitioner's strongest arguments, remains a dominant signal pointing toward a reversal of the Fourth Circuit.\n5.  **The Government's Change in Position (Stable Context):** This remains a relevant historical fact illustrating the post-*Talevski* doctrinal environment.\n6.  **Updated State of Uncertainty (Stable, Extremely Low on Outcome):** My confidence in a ruling for the Petitioner (South Carolina) remains extremely high. The absence of the Respondent's brief does not weaken the Petitioner's case. The primary uncertainty is still the *reasoning* the Court will adopt (e.g., will it formally adopt the Petitioner's bright-line rule?), not the outcome. The secondary uncertainty is the precise nature of the Respondent's rebuttal, whenever it is filed.",
          "design_beliefs": "This observation, a failed search, was surprisingly informative, leading to crucial refinements in my information-gathering methodology and reinforcing the importance of procedural awareness.\n\n1.  **\"Petitioner-First\" Heuristic:** Confirmed.\n2.  **\"Apply *Talevski* via Comparison\":** Confirmed and refined.\n3.  **\"Precedent Bracketing\":** Confirmed.\n4.  **Refined Source Prioritization:** Confirmed.\n5.  **\"The Meta-Cognitive Loop\" & \"Conscious EIG Targeting\":** Validated, but now with a crucial temporal refinement. I correctly identified the next high-EIG document, but the search failed because it was likely not yet available. The heuristic is not just to target high-EIG information, but to target the highest-EIG information *that is currently available according to the case schedule*.\n6.  **\"BIO as Merits Blueprint\":** The caveat is now paramount. The Respondent's pivot from their BIO is the key unknown.\n7.  **\"Track Changes in Position\":** Confirmed.\n8.  **\"Structural Arguments Can Trump Beneficiary-Focus Arguments\":** Massively reinforced by the Petitioner's brief.\n9.  **\"Amicus Briefs as Signals\":** Confirmed.\n10. **\"Prioritize the SG's View in Federal Statutory Cases\":** Confirmed.\n11. **\"Argumentative Framing is Key\":** Confirmed.\n12. **\"Table of Authorities as a Map\":** Confirmed.\n13. **\"The Reflective Pause (THINK Step)\":** Reinforced.\n14. **\"Verify Search Results and Distinguish Document Types\":** Massively reinforced. The search returned the wrong document (the BIO instead of the merits brief). Correctly identifying this error prevented a major analytical blunder. This demonstrates the absolute necessity of verifying a document's identity against the query, not just trusting the search result. I must be vigilant for search tool failure modes, such as returning a low-relevance document when the target is absent.\n15. **\"Account for Litigation Timing\":** Massively reinforced. This failed search strongly suggests the Respondent's merits brief has not yet been filed or is not yet due. Futile searches can be avoided by first understanding the procedural posture of the case.\n16. **\"Look for the 'Off-Ramp' Argument\":** Confirmed as a key heuristic for predicting the Court's reasoning.\n17. **\"Identify Proposed 'Bright-Line Rules'\":** Confirmed as a powerful predictive tool.\n18. **NEW Heuristic: \"Consult the Docket for Filing Deadlines.\"** Before searching for a major filing like a merits brief, I must first attempt to verify the case's official docket to confirm filing deadlines. This makes information gathering more efficient and prevents wasting actions on searches for documents that do not yet exist. This grounds my strategy in the procedural reality of the litigation."

However, it sharpens my understanding of the immediate information gap, shifting it from a substantive question to a procedural one.\n\n1.  **Core Legal Question & Controlling Test (Stable, Dominant Interpretation):** My understanding remains unchanged. The case hinges on whether the \"any qualified provider\" provision (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a(a)(23)(A)) contains \"unambiguously\" rights-creating language sufficient to create a private right of action under the *Gonzaga*/*Talevski* framework.\n2.  **Petitioner's Argumentative Framework (Stable, Dominant):** The Petitioner's case, built on a proposed bright-line rule (requiring the word \"right\" or constitutional text), a direct textual contrast with *Talevski*, and separation-of-powers arguments, remains the dominant and highly persuasive framework for analysis. My confidence in its alignment with the current Court's jurisprudence is unshaken.\n3.  **Respondent's Position (Uncertainty Refined):** This observation confirms that the Respondent's merits brief is not yet available. The uncertainty is no longer just about the *content* of their rebuttal but has been refined to a more immediate procedural question: *when is the brief due?* The Expected Information Gain from the brief remains exceptionally high, but I now know that seeking it directly is futile until I resolve the timing question. My understanding of their arguments is still based on the older Brief in Opposition.\n4.  **The U.S. Government's Position (Stable, Reinforced Signal):** The Solicitor General's amicus brief, which heavily supports the Petitioner's position, continues to be a powerful signal pointing toward a reversal of the Fourth Circuit.\n5.  **The Government's Change in Position (Stable Context):** This remains a relevant piece of the case's history, contextualizing the current doctrinal landscape post-*Talevski*.\n6.  **Updated State of Uncertainty (Stable, Extremely Low on Outcome):** My confidence in a ruling for the Petitioner (South Carolina) remains extremely high. This reflective step does not alter the substantive balance of arguments I have observed so far. The primary uncertainty remains the *reasoning* the Court will use, and the secondary uncertainty is the *content* of the Respondent's eventual filing. The most immediate, tertiary uncertainty is now the *timing* of that filing.",

The repeated failure to find a document triggered a reflective pause. This pause led to a diagnosis (the document likely doesn't exist yet) and the formulation of a new, corrective strategy (check the docket). This proves the loop's value in preventing wasted actions and generating more sophisticated information-gathering plans.\n6.  **\"Conscious EIG Targeting\" (Refined):** This observation adds a crucial layer of sophistication. EIG must be conditioned on *availability*. When a high-EIG document (the Respondent's brief) is unavailable, the action with the highest EIG shifts to resolving the procedural uncertainty that blocks access to it (finding the filing deadline). The goal becomes unblocking the path to future high-value information.\n7.  **\"BIO as Merits Blueprint\":** The caveat remains critical.\n8.  **\"Track Changes in Position\":** Confirmed.\n9.  **\"Structural Arguments Can Trump Beneficiary-Focus Arguments\":** Confirmed.\n10. **\"Amicus Briefs as Signals\" & \"Prioritize the SG's View\":** Confirmed.\n11. **\"Argumentative Framing is Key\":** Confirmed.\n12. **\"Table of Authorities as a Map\":** Confirmed.\n13. **\"Verify Search Results and Distinguish Document Types\":** Confirmed.\n14. **\"Account for Litigation Timing\" (Massively Reinforced):** This principle, identified in the previous step, is now the central focus. The `THINK` action explicitly recognizes that ignoring procedural timing led to inefficiency.\n15. **\"Look for the 'Off-Ramp' Argument\":** Confirmed.\n16. **\"Identify Proposed 'Bright-Line Rules'\":** Confirmed.\n17. **\"Consult the Docket for Filing Deadlines\" (Validated and Operationalized):** This heuristic, proposed in the last update, has now been validated and moved from a hypothesis to an active, prioritized strategy. The `THINK` action's conclusion\u2014to search the docket for a scheduling order\u2014is the direct operationalization of this new rule.
