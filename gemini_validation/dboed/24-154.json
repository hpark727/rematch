    "facts_of_the_case": "Catholic Charities Bureau (CCB) is the social ministry arm of the Diocese of Superior in Wisconsin, operating since 1917 to provide services to the poor and disadvantaged as an expression of the Catholic Church's social ministry. The organization is controlled by the bishop of the Diocese, who serves as CCB\u2019s president and appoints its membership. CCB\u2019s mission is to provide service to people in need and advocate for justice, with a philosophy rooted in being \u201can effective sign of the charity of Christ.\u201d The organization makes no distinctions based on race, sex, or religion in its services, employment, or board appointments.\n\nUnder CCB\u2019s umbrella are four sub-entities involved in this case: Barron County Developmental Services, Black River Industries, Diversified Services, and Headwaters. These entities provide various social services, including job placement and coaching for people with disabilities, community-based training, daily living services, and support programs. While CCB oversees these sub-entities and provides management services, the sub-entities themselves are primarily funded through government contracts and do not receive direct funding from the Diocese. Neither employees nor service recipients are required to be of any particular religious faith, and the programs do not provide religious training or attempt to promote the Catholic faith.\n\nCCB and its sub-entities sought an exemption from state unemployment insurance contributions in 2016, but the Department of Workforce Development denied the exemption. An administrative law judge reversed that decision, but then the Labor and Industry Review Commission (LIRC) reversed again, finding the organizations were not operated primarily for religious purposes. Then, the circuit court sided with CCB, and then the Wisconsin Court of Appeals reversed and reinstated LIRC\u2019s decision. Ultimately, the Wisconsin Supreme Court affirmed, holding that the organizations did not qualify for the religious purposes exemption under state law.",

There appears to be a trend of decisions favoring religious freedom claims against government regulation. Understanding this trend and the legal tests the Court is currently applying (e.g., moving away from the *Lemon* test, applying history and tradition) is crucial for building an effective predictive model (D). The Petition will also inform this by showing what arguments the petitioners believe will be persuasive to the current Court.\n\n**Action Selection:**\nMy first action should be to retrieve the foundational document of the case at the Supreme Court level: the Petition for a Writ of Certiorari.

I now frame the core legal conflict as a First Amendment issue. The central question is whether Wisconsin's application of its \"primarily for religious purposes\" test to a religious organization constitutes impermissible government entanglement with religion and discrimination against it.

I've learned this document is information-dense, providing critical data for both task-level and design-level beliefs. It contains the petitioner's core legal arguments (\u03b8) and reveals their strategic assessment of which arguments will be most persuasive to the current Court (D).\n2.  **Contextual Analysis is Key:** A prediction cannot be made in a vacuum. It's crucial to analyze the broader jurisprudential trends of the current Supreme Court. Specifically for this case, I must investigate the Court's recent rulings on the Free Exercise and Establishment Clauses. I have a working hypothesis that there is a discernible trend favoring religious freedom claims and a move away from older tests (like the *Lemon* test) toward analyses based on history and tradition.\n3.  **Legal Briefs as Strategic Data:** The arguments presented by the parties should be viewed not just as legal reasoning, but as strategic choices. Understanding *why* a petitioner frames an issue in a particular way provides meta-level insight into the perceived ideologies and receptiveness of the current justices.

Catholic Charities Bureau (CCB), a religiously-affiliated social services organization, was denied a state unemployment tax exemption by the Wisconsin Labor & Industry Review Commission (LIRC) on the grounds that it was not \"operated primarily for religious purposes.\" This decision was ultimately affirmed by the Wisconsin Supreme Court. The central legal question before the U.S. Supreme Court is whether this denial, based on the state's specific criteria for what constitutes \"religious\" activity, violates the First Amendment's religion clauses.\n\nMy previous analysis identified a critical information gap: I lack knowledge of the specific legal arguments and precedents the petitioners (CCB) are using to frame their First Amendment challenge. My plan was to obtain the Petition for a Writ of Certiorari to fill this gap. However, my attempt to retrieve this document via a targeted search of the docket files failed. Consequently, my task-specific knowledge has not advanced. The key uncertainties I previously identified\u2014the precise nature of CCB's free exercise and establishment clause claims, the specific precedents they will cite, and the detailed reasoning of the Wisconsin Supreme Court's opinion they are challenging\u2014remain unresolved.

It does not invalidate my belief in the *value* of the Petition; its importance as a primary source remains paramount. However, it directly challenges the *reliability* of my initial information-gathering tactic. This leads to an important evolution in my design beliefs:\n\n1.  **Source Prioritization Heuristic (Unchanged):** The Petition for a Writ of Certiorari remains the highest-value initial target for information gathering in a Supreme Court case. It outlines the petitioner's core arguments and strategic framing.\n2.  **Contextual Analysis is Key (Unchanged):** Understanding the Court's recent trends on related issues (here, religious freedom) is essential for a robust prediction. My working hypothesis that the Court is trending towards favoring religious freedom claims and away from older tests like *Lemon* remains a key avenue for investigation.\n3.  **Legal Briefs as Strategic Data (Unchanged):** The framing of arguments is a signal about the petitioner's assessment of the Court's ideological landscape.\n4.  **NEW - Search Strategy Resilience and Redundancy:** My previous belief in a simple, direct retrieval method was naive. The failure of the specific search query teaches me that information systems can be brittle and document indexing can be inconsistent. My methodology must now incorporate a more robust search strategy. This includes:\n    *   **Iterative Broadening:** If a highly specific query fails, the next step should be to broaden the search parameters (e.g., search for all documents in the docket, use more general keywords).\n    *   **Methodological Pivoting:** If a `docket_files` search fails, I should pivot to alternative search types, such as a general web search (`OPEN_SEARCH`), which might locate the document on other legal websites (e.g., SCOTUSblog, the petitioner's counsel's website).\n    *   **Secondary Source Fallback:** If primary source retrieval is persistently difficult, an effective strategy is to search for reliable secondary sources (e.g., legal news analysis, blog posts) that summarize the contents of the primary document. This provides a way to advance task-level knowledge (\u03b8) even when the ideal source is inaccessible."

Specifically, can \nWisconsin disqualify Catholic Charities from an oth-\nerwise-available tax exemption because, in keeping \nwith Catholic teaching, it hires both Catholics and \nnon-Catholics, helps both Catholics and non-Catho-\nlics, and does not proselytize those it serves? As we ex-\nplain below, the Constitution says no. \nLike many other states, and consistent with the \nFederal Unemployment Tax Act, 26 U.S.C. 3309, Wis-\nconsin exempts certain \u201cchurches\u201d and religious \u201cnon-\nprofit organizations\u201d from paying taxes into the state\u2019s \nunemployment compensation system. Wis. Stat. \n\u00a7 108.02(15)(h). For example, Wisconsin exempts the \nDiocese of Superior, a Roman Catholic diocese, from \nthe unemployment compensation tax because it is a \nchurch.  \nBut Wisconsin refuses to extend an exemption to \nthe Diocese of Superior\u2019s separately incorporated char-\nitable ministry arm, Catholic Charities. That is be-\ncause under Wisconsin law, as definitively interpreted \nby the Wisconsin Supreme Court, Catholic Charities \nmust show that its activities are sufficiently similar \n\u201cin nature\u201d to whatever the state determines to be \n\u201ctypical\u201d religious activities. Pet.App.26a-27a, 29a. \nAnd in the Wisconsin Supreme Court\u2019s view, Catholic \nCharities\u2019 ministry \u201cto individuals with developmental \nand mental health disabilities\u201d is not religious activity \nat all but is instead \u201cprimarily charitable and secular.\u201d \nPet.App.30a. Indeed, for the Wisconsin Supreme \nCourt, the \u201cCatholic\u201d in \u201cCatholic Charities\u201d is entirely \n\n2 \n \nsuperfluous because services to the disabled \u201ccan be \nprovided by organizations of either religious or secular \nmotivations, and the services provided would not dif-\nfer in any sense.\u201d Pet.App.30a. \nAlso important\u2014according to the Wisconsin Su-\npreme Court\u2014is what Catholic Charities does not do: \n\u201cattempt to imbue program participants with the \nCatholic faith [or] supply any religious materials to \nprogram participants or employees.\u201d Pet.App.29a. If \nCatholic Charities were to proselytize those it serves, \nrefuse to help non-Catholics, or refuse to hire non-\nCatholics, then its activities might fit the stereotypes \nof religion the Wisconsin Supreme Court relies on. But \nbecause Catholic Charities\u2019 religious beliefs do not al-\nlow it to conform to those stereotypes, its ministry is \nnot \u201creligious in nature\u201d and it thus flunks the test for \nobtaining a religious exemption.  \nThis is therefore a simple case. Wisconsin has de-\nnied Catholic Charities a religious exemption that the \nstate freely extends to other religious organizations \nbased on the absurd view that Catholic Charities\u2019 aid \nto the needy isn\u2019t actually religious at all. The Religion \nClauses of the First Amendment do not allow such a \nremarkable conclusion. Instead, the Clauses work in \ntandem to protect a sphere of autonomy for religious \norganizations, to prevent entanglement of church and \nstate, and to prohibit government discrimination \namong religious organizations. Wisconsin\u2019s effort to \npick and choose among religious groups\u2014and carve \nout works of mercy from the realm of the \u201creligious\u201d \naltogether\u2014thus violates the Constitution three times \nover.  \n\n3 \n \nOPINIONS BELOW \nThe decision of the Supreme Court of Wisconsin \n(Pet.App.1a-124a) is reported at 3 N.W.3d 666. The de-\ncision of the Court of Appeals of Wisconsin \n(Pet.App.125a-168a) is reported at 987 N.W.2d 778. \nThe decision of the Court of Appeals of Wisconsin cer-\ntifying this appeal to the Supreme Court of Wisconsin \n(Pet.App.169a-188a) is not reported. The decision of \nthe Douglas County Circuit Court (Pet.App.189a-\n211a) is not reported. \nJURISDICTION \nThis Court has jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \n1257(a). \nCONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY \nPROVISIONS INVOLVED \nThe First Amendment to the United States Consti-\ntution provides that \u201cCongress shall make no law re-\nspecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting \nthe \nfree \nexercise \nthereof  * * *  .\u201d \nU.S. \nConst. \nAmend. I. \nThe Federal Unemployment Tax Act states in rele-\nvant part: \n(b) This section shall not apply to service per-\nformed\u2014 \n(1) in the employ of (A) a church or convention or \nassociation of churches, (B) an organization \nwhich is operated primarily for religious pur-\nposes and which is operated, supervised, con-\ntrolled, or principally supported by a church or \nconvention or association of churches, or (C) an \nelementary or secondary school which is oper-\nated primarily for religious purposes, which is \n\n4 \n \ndescribed in section 501(c)(3), and which is ex-\nempt from tax under section 501(a). \n26 U.S.C. 3309(b)(1). \nWisconsin\u2019s Unemployment Insurance and Re-\nserves law states in relevant part: \n(h) \u201cEmployment\u201d as applied to work for a non-\nprofit organization  * * *  does not include ser-\nvice: \n1. In the employ of a church or convention or \nassociation of churches; [or] \n2. In the employ of an organization operated \nprimarily for religious purposes and oper-\nated, supervised, controlled, or principally \nsupported by a church or convention or asso-\nciation of churches;  \nWis. Stat. \u00a7 108.02(15)(h)(1)-(2). \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nA. The Federal Unemployment Tax Act and \nthe religious purposes exemption \nThe Federal Unemployment Tax Act (FUTA), 26 \nU.S.C. 3301-3311 \u201ccall[s] for a cooperative federal-\nstate program of benefits to unemployed workers.\u201d St. \nMartin Evangelical Lutheran Church v. South Dakota, \n451 U.S. 772, 775 (1981). As part of this cooperative \nsystem, employers pay the federal government a per-\ncentage of their employees\u2019 annual wages to fund job \nservice programs, to support state unemployment \nagencies (in times of high unemployment), and to sup-\nport a federally administered fund against which \nstates may borrow to pay unemployment benefits. But \nthese employers can claim a credit of up to 90% of this \n\n5 \n \nfederal tax for \u201ccontributions\u201d they have made to fed-\nerally approved state unemployment compensation \nprograms (which provide benefits directly to unem-\nployed workers), thus reducing the amount of money \nthose employers owe to the federal government and re-\nducing their overall tax burden. Id. at 775 n.3; 26 \nU.S.C. 3302(a)(1). \nTo allow their employers to take advantage of the \nfederal tax credit, all states (including Wisconsin) \nhave complementary statutes, which the Secretary of \nLabor reviews and annually certifies as compliant \nwith FUTA\u2019s requirements. See 26 U.S.C. 3304(a), (b). \nThese complementary statutes must impose, at a min-\nimum, the same level of coverage mandated by FUTA. \nSee Wimberly v. Labor & Indus. Rels. Comm\u2019n of Mo., \n479 U.S. 511, 514 (1987) (\u201cThe Act establishes certain \nminimum federal standards that a State must satisfy \nin order for a State to participate in the program.\u201d); \nSt. Martin\u00b8 451 U.S. at 775 n.3 (similar).  \nFUTA contains a religious exemption that narrows \nthe scope of the law\u2019s mandatory coverage require-\nments in three circumstances. First, the law exempts \nany \u201cchurch or convention or association of churches.\u201d \n26 U.S.C. 3309(b)(1)(A). Second, the law exempts any \nnonprofit \u201coperated primarily for religious purposes,\u201d \nbut only if also \u201coperated, supervised, controlled, or \nprincipally supported by a church or convention or as-\nsociation of churches.\u201d 26 U.S.C. 3309(b)(1)(B). Third, \nthe law exempts religious schools that are \u201coperated \nprimarily for religious purposes\u201d and are federally tax-\nexempt under 26 U.S.C. 501(c)(3). 26 U.S.C. \n3309(b)(1)(C).  \n\n6 \n \nTwice before, this Court considered constitutional \nclaims challenging the scope of FUTA\u2019s \u201creligious pur-\nposes\u201d exemption but resolved both cases on alterna-\ntive grounds. St. Martin, 451 U.S. at 788 (holding reli-\ngious school plaintiffs were exempt from South Da-\nkota\u2019s \nunemployment \ntax \nunder \n26 \nU.S.C. \n3309(b)(1)(A)); California v. Grace Brethren Church, \n457 U.S. 393, 417 (1982) (holding the Tax Injunction \nAct prohibited a federal district court from entering \ndeclaratory relief).  \nToday, forty-seven states have adopted language \nidentical, or nearly identical, to FUTA\u2019s exclusion of \nnonprofits \u201coperated primarily for religious purposes.\u201d \nSee Pet.6 n.1. Wisconsin thus requires nonprofits \nwhich meet certain minimum qualifications to pay \ninto its state unemployment program, Wis. Stat. \n\u00a7 108.02(13)(b), while exempting nonprofits \u201coperated \nprimarily for religious purposes\u201d under Wis. Stat. \n\u00a7 108.02(15)(h)(2), a provision nearly identical to \nFUTA\u2019s exemption.1  \nB. Catholic \nCharities \nand \nits \nreligious \nmission \nPetitioner Catholic Charities Bureau is a Wiscon-\nsin nonprofit corporation and the social ministry arm \nof the Diocese of Superior, a diocese of the Roman \nCatholic Church comprised of over 75,000 Catholics \nstretching over 15,000 square miles of northern Wis-\nconsin. Pet.App.371a. Its mission is \u201c[t]o carry on the \nredeeming work of our Lord by reflecting gospel values \nand the moral teaching of the church.\u201d Pet.App.382a, \n \n1  \nThe only differences\u2014the omission of two instances of the \nwords \u201cwhich is\u201d\u2014are immaterial. Compare Wis. Stat. \n\u00a7 108.02(15)(h)(2) with 26 U.S.C. 3309(b)(1)(B). \n\n7 \n \n428a. Since 1917, Catholic Charities has carried out \nthis mission by \u201cproviding services to the poor and dis-\nadvantaged as an expression of the social ministry of \nthe Catholic Church.\u201d Pet.App.383a, 431a. Its \u201cpur-\npose  * * *  is to be an effective sign of the charity of \nChrist\u201d by providing services without making distinc-\ntions \u201cby race, sex, or religion.\u201d Pet.App.383a, 431a. \nCatholic Charities views this ministry as a mandate of \nCatholic social teaching and a primary tenet of the \nfaith. Pet.App.373a-379a. And Catholic Charities \npledges that it \u201cwill in its activities and actions reflect \ngospel values and will be consistent with its mission \nand the mission of the Diocese of Superior.\u201d \nPet.App.384a, 429a.  \nCatholic Charities fulfills this mission by carrying \nout a wide variety of ministries for the elderly, the dis-\nabled, the poor, and those in need of disaster relief. \nPet.App.372a-373a. From offering shelter to the el-\nderly poor and those suffering from chronic mental or \nphysical illnesses to ministering to the sick in their \nhomes, Catholic Charities shares the love of Christ \nwith \u201cmore than 10,500 people\u201d each year. J.A.120. \nSee, e.g., J.A.103-104, 113-117, 152-153, 169-171, 181-\n182.  \nCatholic Charities is separately incorporated from \nthe Diocese of Superior and, like the Diocese, has \n501(c)(3) status under the Roman Catholic Church\u2019s \ngroup tax exemption. Pet.App.386a-402a. Catholic \nCharities was organized in this way to accord with \nCatholic teaching on subsidiarity. J.A.200, 208. As one \nof the seven principles of Catholic social teaching, sub-\nsidiarity instructs that it is an \u201cinjustice  * * *  and \ndisturbance of right order to assign to a greater and \n\n8 \n \nhigher association what lesser and subordinate organ-\nizations can do.\u201d Pontifical Council for Justice and \nPeace, Compendium of the Social Doctrine of the \nChurch \u00b6 186 (2004) (quoting Pope Pius XI, Quadra-\ngesimo Anno \u00b6 79 (1931)). This principle allows \u201cinter-\nmediate social entities [to] properly perform the func-\ntions that fall to them without being required to hand \nthem over unjustly to other social entities of a higher \nlevel, by which they would end up being absorbed and \nsubstituted.\u201d Ibid.; Pope Benedict XVI, Deus Caritas \nEst \u00b6 31 (2005) (\u201cThe increase in diversified organiza-\ntions engaged in meeting various human needs is ulti-\nmately due to the fact that the command of love of \nneighbour is inscribed by the Creator in man\u2019s very \nnature.\u201d). \nIn keeping with this principle, Catholic Charities \nalso oversees several separately incorporated sub-en-\ntities that help it carry out various aspects of its min-\nistry in local communities across a wide area of rural \nnorthern Wisconsin. These include Petitioners Head-\nwaters, Barron County Developmental Services, Di-\nversified Services, and Black River Industries. \nPet.App.128a-130a. For example, Barron County De-\nvelopmental Services helps the disabled in Barron \nCounty, which is in a part of the Diocese located over \n100 miles south of the Diocese\u2019s seat in Superior. \nThe Bishop of the Diocese of Superior has plenary \ncontrol over Catholic Charities: He \u201coversees CCB in \nits entirety, including its sub-entities.\u201d Pet.App.7a-8a, \n130a. He serves as president of Catholic Charities and \nappoints its \u201cmembership,\u201d which consists of the \nbishop himself, the vicar general of the Diocese of Su-\nperior, and the Executive Director of Catholic Chari-\nties. Pet.App.7a, 415a-417a. The bishop also appoints \n\n9 \n \nthe board of directors of Catholic Charities, which help \nadvise Catholic Charities\u2019 membership. Pet.App.419a-\n421a. \nCatholic Charities\u2019 membership oversees the entire \nministry to ensure fulfillment of Catholic Charities\u2019 \nmission in compliance with Catholic social teaching. \nPet.App.28a-29a, 416a-417a. This includes the minis-\ntries of Catholic Charities\u2019 sub-entities. Each sub-en-\ntity signs Catholic Charities\u2019 Guiding Principles of \nCorporate Affiliation, which gives Catholic Charities \nultimate responsibility for ensuring the sub-entities \nremain \nfaithful \nto \ntheir \nCatholic \nmission. \nPet.App.422a-425a. And each sub-entity is directed to \ncomply fully with Catholic social teaching in providing \nservices. Pet.App.8a, 425a. All new key staff and direc-\ntor-level positions receive a manual entitled The So-\ncial Ministry of Catholic Charities Bureau in the Dio-\ncese of Superior, which they must review during orien-\ntation. Pet.App.371a-385a. In addition, every new em-\nployee receives a welcome letter with Catholic Chari-\nties\u2019 mission statement, code of ethics, and statement \n\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

Specifically, can \nWisconsin disqualify Catholic Charities from an oth-\nerwise-available tax exemption because, in keeping \nwith Catholic teaching, it hires both Catholics and \nnon-Catholics, helps both Catholics and non-Catho-\nlics, and does not proselytize those it serves? As we ex-\nplain below, the Constitution says no. \nLike many other states, and consistent with the \nFederal Unemployment Tax Act, 26 U.S.C. 3309, Wis-\nconsin exempts certain \u201cchurches\u201d and religious \u201cnon-\nprofit organizations\u201d from paying taxes into the state\u2019s \nunemployment compensation system. Wis. Stat. \n\u00a7 108.02(15)(h). For example, Wisconsin exempts the \nDiocese of Superior, a Roman Catholic diocese, from \nthe unemployment compensation tax because it is a \nchurch.  \nBut Wisconsin refuses to extend an exemption to \nthe Diocese of Superior\u2019s separately incorporated char-\nitable ministry arm, Catholic Charities. That is be-\ncause under Wisconsin law, as definitively interpreted \nby the Wisconsin Supreme Court, Catholic Charities \nmust show that its activities are sufficiently similar \n\u201cin nature\u201d to whatever the state determines to be \n\u201ctypical\u201d religious activities. Pet.App.26a-27a, 29a. \nAnd in the Wisconsin Supreme Court\u2019s view, Catholic \nCharities\u2019 ministry \u201cto individuals with developmental \nand mental health disabilities\u201d is not religious activity \nat all but is instead \u201cprimarily charitable and secular.\u201d \nPet.App.30a. Indeed, for the Wisconsin Supreme \nCourt, the \u201cCatholic\u201d in \u201cCatholic Charities\u201d is entirely \n\n2 \n \nsuperfluous because services to the disabled \u201ccan be \nprovided by organizations of either religious or secular \nmotivations, and the services provided would not dif-\nfer in any sense.\u201d Pet.App.30a. \nAlso important\u2014according to the Wisconsin Su-\npreme Court\u2014is what Catholic Charities does not do: \n\u201cattempt to imbue program participants with the \nCatholic faith [or] supply any religious materials to \nprogram participants or employees.\u201d Pet.App.29a. If \nCatholic Charities were to proselytize those it serves, \nrefuse to help non-Catholics, or refuse to hire non-\nCatholics, then its activities might fit the stereotypes \nof religion the Wisconsin Supreme Court relies on. But \nbecause Catholic Charities\u2019 religious beliefs do not al-\nlow it to conform to those stereotypes, its ministry is \nnot \u201creligious in nature\u201d and it thus flunks the test for \nobtaining a religious exemption.  \nThis is therefore a simple case. Wisconsin has de-\nnied Catholic Charities a religious exemption that the \nstate freely extends to other religious organizations \nbased on the absurd view that Catholic Charities\u2019 aid \nto the needy isn\u2019t actually religious at all. The Religion \nClauses of the First Amendment do not allow such a \nremarkable conclusion. Instead, the Clauses work in \ntandem to protect a sphere of autonomy for religious \norganizations, to prevent entanglement of church and \nstate, and to prohibit government discrimination \namong religious organizations. Wisconsin\u2019s effort to \npick and choose among religious groups\u2014and carve \nout works of mercy from the realm of the \u201creligious\u201d \naltogether\u2014thus violates the Constitution three times \nover.  \n\n3 \n \nOPINIONS BELOW \nThe decision of the Supreme Court of Wisconsin \n(Pet.App.1a-124a) is reported at 3 N.W.3d 666. The de-\ncision of the Court of Appeals of Wisconsin \n(Pet.App.125a-168a) is reported at 987 N.W.2d 778. \nThe decision of the Court of Appeals of Wisconsin cer-\ntifying this appeal to the Supreme Court of Wisconsin \n(Pet.App.169a-188a) is not reported. The decision of \nthe Douglas County Circuit Court (Pet.App.189a-\n211a) is not reported. \nJURISDICTION \nThis Court has jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \n1257(a). \nCONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY \nPROVISIONS INVOLVED \nThe First Amendment to the United States Consti-\ntution provides that \u201cCongress shall make no law re-\nspecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting \nthe \nfree \nexercise \nthereof  * * *  .\u201d \nU.S. \nConst. \nAmend. I. \nThe Federal Unemployment Tax Act states in rele-\nvant part: \n(b) This section shall not apply to service per-\nformed\u2014 \n(1) in the employ of (A) a church or convention or \nassociation of churches, (B) an organization \nwhich is operated primarily for religious pur-\nposes and which is operated, supervised, con-\ntrolled, or principally supported by a church or \nconvention or association of churches, or (C) an \nelementary or secondary school which is oper-\nated primarily for religious purposes, which is \n\n4 \n \ndescribed in section 501(c)(3), and which is ex-\nempt from tax under section 501(a). \n26 U.S.C. 3309(b)(1). \nWisconsin\u2019s Unemployment Insurance and Re-\nserves law states in relevant part: \n(h) \u201cEmployment\u201d as applied to work for a non-\nprofit organization  * * *  does not include ser-\nvice: \n1. In the employ of a church or convention or \nassociation of churches; [or] \n2. In the employ of an organization operated \nprimarily for religious purposes and oper-\nated, supervised, controlled, or principally \nsupported by a church or convention or asso-\nciation of churches;  \nWis. Stat. \u00a7 108.02(15)(h)(1)-(2). \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nA. The Federal Unemployment Tax Act and \nthe religious purposes exemption \nThe Federal Unemployment Tax Act (FUTA), 26 \nU.S.C. 3301-3311 \u201ccall[s] for a cooperative federal-\nstate program of benefits to unemployed workers.\u201d St. \nMartin Evangelical Lutheran Church v. South Dakota, \n451 U.S. 772, 775 (1981). As part of this cooperative \nsystem, employers pay the federal government a per-\ncentage of their employees\u2019 annual wages to fund job \nservice programs, to support state unemployment \nagencies (in times of high unemployment), and to sup-\nport a federally administered fund against which \nstates may borrow to pay unemployment benefits. But \nthese employers can claim a credit of up to 90% of this \n\n5 \n \nfederal tax for \u201ccontributions\u201d they have made to fed-\nerally approved state unemployment compensation \nprograms (which provide benefits directly to unem-\nployed workers), thus reducing the amount of money \nthose employers owe to the federal government and re-\nducing their overall tax burden. Id. at 775 n.3; 26 \nU.S.C. 3302(a)(1). \nTo allow their employers to take advantage of the \nfederal tax credit, all states (including Wisconsin) \nhave complementary statutes, which the Secretary of \nLabor reviews and annually certifies as compliant \nwith FUTA\u2019s requirements. See 26 U.S.C. 3304(a), (b). \nThese complementary statutes must impose, at a min-\nimum, the same level of coverage mandated by FUTA. \nSee Wimberly v. Labor & Indus. Rels. Comm\u2019n of Mo., \n479 U.S. 511, 514 (1987) (\u201cThe Act establishes certain \nminimum federal standards that a State must satisfy \nin order for a State to participate in the program.\u201d); \nSt. Martin\u00b8 451 U.S. at 775 n.3 (similar).  \nFUTA contains a religious exemption that narrows \nthe scope of the law\u2019s mandatory coverage require-\nments in three circumstances. First, the law exempts \nany \u201cchurch or convention or association of churches.\u201d \n26 U.S.C. 3309(b)(1)(A). Second, the law exempts any \nnonprofit \u201coperated primarily for religious purposes,\u201d \nbut only if also \u201coperated, supervised, controlled, or \nprincipally supported by a church or convention or as-\nsociation of churches.\u201d 26 U.S.C. 3309(b)(1)(B). Third, \nthe law exempts religious schools that are \u201coperated \nprimarily for religious purposes\u201d and are federally tax-\nexempt under 26 U.S.C. 501(c)(3). 26 U.S.C. \n3309(b)(1)(C).  \n\n6 \n \nTwice before, this Court considered constitutional \nclaims challenging the scope of FUTA\u2019s \u201creligious pur-\nposes\u201d exemption but resolved both cases on alterna-\ntive grounds. St. Martin, 451 U.S. at 788 (holding reli-\ngious school plaintiffs were exempt from South Da-\nkota\u2019s \nunemployment \ntax \nunder \n26 \nU.S.C. \n3309(b)(1)(A)); California v. Grace Brethren Church, \n457 U.S. 393, 417 (1982) (holding the Tax Injunction \nAct prohibited a federal district court from entering \ndeclaratory relief).  \nToday, forty-seven states have adopted language \nidentical, or nearly identical, to FUTA\u2019s exclusion of \nnonprofits \u201coperated primarily for religious purposes.\u201d \nSee Pet.6 n.1. Wisconsin thus requires nonprofits \nwhich meet certain minimum qualifications to pay \ninto its state unemployment program, Wis. Stat. \n\u00a7 108.02(13)(b), while exempting nonprofits \u201coperated \nprimarily for religious purposes\u201d under Wis. Stat. \n\u00a7 108.02(15)(h)(2), a provision nearly identical to \nFUTA\u2019s exemption.1  \nB. Catholic \nCharities \nand \nits \nreligious \nmission \nPetitioner Catholic Charities Bureau is a Wiscon-\nsin nonprofit corporation and the social ministry arm \nof the Diocese of Superior, a diocese of the Roman \nCatholic Church comprised of over 75,000 Catholics \nstretching over 15,000 square miles of northern Wis-\nconsin. Pet.App.371a. Its mission is \u201c[t]o carry on the \nredeeming work of our Lord by reflecting gospel values \nand the moral teaching of the church.\u201d Pet.App.382a, \n \n1  \nThe only differences\u2014the omission of two instances of the \nwords \u201cwhich is\u201d\u2014are immaterial. Compare Wis. Stat. \n\u00a7 108.02(15)(h)(2) with 26 U.S.C. 3309(b)(1)(B). \n\n7 \n \n428a. Since 1917, Catholic Charities has carried out \nthis mission by \u201cproviding services to the poor and dis-\nadvantaged as an expression of the social ministry of \nthe Catholic Church.\u201d Pet.App.383a, 431a. Its \u201cpur-\npose  * * *  is to be an effective sign of the charity of \nChrist\u201d by providing services without making distinc-\ntions \u201cby race, sex, or religion.\u201d Pet.App.383a, 431a. \nCatholic Charities views this ministry as a mandate of \nCatholic social teaching and a primary tenet of the \nfaith. Pet.App.373a-379a. And Catholic Charities \npledges that it \u201cwill in its activities and actions reflect \ngospel values and will be consistent with its mission \nand the mission of the Diocese of Superior.\u201d \nPet.App.384a, 429a.  \nCatholic Charities fulfills this mission by carrying \nout a wide variety of ministries for the elderly, the dis-\nabled, the poor, and those in need of disaster relief. \nPet.App.372a-373a. From offering shelter to the el-\nderly poor and those suffering from chronic mental or \nphysical illnesses to ministering to the sick in their \nhomes, Catholic Charities shares the love of Christ \nwith \u201cmore than 10,500 people\u201d each year. J.A.120. \nSee, e.g., J.A.103-104, 113-117, 152-153, 169-171, 181-\n182.  \nCatholic Charities is separately incorporated from \nthe Diocese of Superior and, like the Diocese, has \n501(c)(3) status under the Roman Catholic Church\u2019s \ngroup tax exemption. Pet.App.386a-402a. Catholic \nCharities was organized in this way to accord with \nCatholic teaching on subsidiarity. J.A.200, 208. As one \nof the seven principles of Catholic social teaching, sub-\nsidiarity instructs that it is an \u201cinjustice  * * *  and \ndisturbance of right order to assign to a greater and \n\n8 \n \nhigher association what lesser and subordinate organ-\nizations can do.\u201d Pontifical Council for Justice and \nPeace, Compendium of the Social Doctrine of the \nChurch \u00b6 186 (2004) (quoting Pope Pius XI, Quadra-\ngesimo Anno \u00b6 79 (1931)). This principle allows \u201cinter-\nmediate social entities [to] properly perform the func-\ntions that fall to them without being required to hand \nthem over unjustly to other social entities of a higher \nlevel, by which they would end up being absorbed and \nsubstituted.\u201d Ibid.; Pope Benedict XVI, Deus Caritas \nEst \u00b6 31 (2005) (\u201cThe increase in diversified organiza-\ntions engaged in meeting various human needs is ulti-\nmately due to the fact that the command of love of \nneighbour is inscribed by the Creator in man\u2019s very \nnature.\u201d). \nIn keeping with this principle, Catholic Charities \nalso oversees several separately incorporated sub-en-\ntities that help it carry out various aspects of its min-\nistry in local communities across a wide area of rural \nnorthern Wisconsin. These include Petitioners Head-\nwaters, Barron County Developmental Services, Di-\nversified Services, and Black River Industries. \nPet.App.128a-130a. For example, Barron County De-\nvelopmental Services helps the disabled in Barron \nCounty, which is in a part of the Diocese located over \n100 miles south of the Diocese\u2019s seat in Superior. \nThe Bishop of the Diocese of Superior has plenary \ncontrol over Catholic Charities: He \u201coversees CCB in \nits entirety, including its sub-entities.\u201d Pet.App.7a-8a, \n130a. He serves as president of Catholic Charities and \nappoints its \u201cmembership,\u201d which consists of the \nbishop himself, the vicar general of the Diocese of Su-\nperior, and the Executive Director of Catholic Chari-\nties. Pet.App.7a, 415a-417a. The bishop also appoints \n\n9 \n \nthe board of directors of Catholic Charities, which help \nadvise Catholic Charities\u2019 membership. Pet.App.419a-\n421a. \nCatholic Charities\u2019 membership oversees the entire \nministry to ensure fulfillment of Catholic Charities\u2019 \nmission in compliance with Catholic social teaching. \nPet.App.28a-29a, 416a-417a. This includes the minis-\ntries of Catholic Charities\u2019 sub-entities. Each sub-en-\ntity signs Catholic Charities\u2019 Guiding Principles of \nCorporate Affiliation, which gives Catholic Charities \nultimate responsibility for ensuring the sub-entities \nremain \nfaithful \nto \ntheir \nCatholic \nmission. \nPet.App.422a-425a. And each sub-entity is directed to \ncomply fully with Catholic social teaching in providing \nservices. Pet.App.8a, 425a. All new key staff and direc-\ntor-level positions receive a manual entitled The So-\ncial Ministry of Catholic Charities Bureau in the Dio-\ncese of Superior, which they must review during orien-\ntation. Pet.App.371a-385a. In addition, every new em-\nployee receives a welcome letter with Catholic Chari-\nties\u2019 mission statement, code of ethics, and statement \nof \nthe \nministry\u2019s \nphilosophy \ntoward \nservice. \nPet.App.131a, 207a, 380a-385a, 469a-475a. All em-\nployees are instructed to abide by these documents. \nPet.App.130a-131a, 207a. \nCatholic Charities\u2019 ministry is also guided by the \nprinciples of its Catholic faith. Specifically, Catholic \nteaching \u201c\u2018demand[s]\u2019 that Catholics respond in char-\nity to those in need.\u201d Pet.App.128a; see also Deus Cari-\ntas Est \u00b6 32 (\u201c[Charity] has been an essential part of \n[the Church\u2019s] mission from the very beginning.\u201d); \nJames 1:27 (RSV-CE) (\u201cReligion that is pure and un-\ndefiled before God and the Father is this: to visit or-\nphans and widows in their affliction[.]). Indeed, the \n\n10 \n \nCatholic Church \u201cclaims works of charity as its own \ninalienable duty and right.\u201d Pope Saint Paul VI, Apos-\ntolicam Actuositatem \u00b6 8 (1965); Catechism of the \nCatholic Church \u00b6 1826 (charity \u201cis the first of the the-\nological virtues\u201d); Deus Caritas Est \u00b6 25(a) (\u201cFor the \nChurch, charity is not a kind of welfare activity which \ncould equally well be left to others, but is a part of her \nnature, an indispensable expression of her very be-\ning.\u201d). To Catholic Charities, the purpose, form, and \noutworking of charity are fundamentally and inescap-\nably religious. \nCatholic teaching also confirms that the Church\u2019s \ncharitable ministry \u201cmust embrace the entire human \nrace.\u201d Compendium of the Social Doctrine of the \nChurch \u00b6 581. The Church therefore instructs that \ncharity should be exercised \u201cin an impartial manner \ntowards\u201d \u201cmembers of other religions.\u201d Congregation \nfor Bishops, Directory for the Pastoral Ministry of \nBishops \u201cApostolorum Successores\u201d \u00b6 208 (2004); Ap-\nostolicam Actuositatem \u00b6 8 (\u201c[C]haritable enterprises \ncan and should reach out to all persons and all \nneeds.\u201d). Catholic bodies may not \u201cmisus[e] works of \ncharity for purposes of proselytism.\u201d Apostolorum Suc-\ncessores \u00b6 196. As Pope Benedict XVI explained, \n\u201cThose who practise charity in the Church\u2019s name will \nnever seek to impose the Church\u2019s faith upon others.\u201d \nDeus Caritas Est \u00b6 31(c). And indeed, this same \u201cEcu-\nmenical orientation\u201d informs Catholic Charities\u2019 belief \nthat \u201cno distinctions\u201d should be made by \u201crace, sex, or \nreligion\u201d with regard to \u201cstaff employed,\u201d so that its \nministry can be \u201can effective sign of the charity of \nChrist.\u201d Pet.App.383a.   \nFor Catholic Charities and the Diocese, this is all \nunto religious ends: Serving those in need consistent \n\n11 \n \nwith the above religious teachings \u201cis the best witness \nto the God in whom we believe and by whom we are \ndriven to love.\u201d Deus Caritas Est \u00b6 31(c). For \u201c[a] \nChristian knows when it is time to speak of God and \nwhen it is better to say nothing and to let love alone \nspeak.\u201d Ibid. And thus \u201c[i]t is the responsibility of the \nChurch\u2019s charitable organizations to reinforce this \nawareness in their members, so that by their activ-\nity\u2014as well as their words, their silence, their exam-\nple\u2014they may be credible witnesses to Christ.\u201d Ibid.  \nC. Catholic Charities seeks to participate in \nthe Wisconsin bishops\u2019 unemployment \nassistance program \nFor the Catholic Church, \u201c[t]he obligation to pro-\nvide unemployment benefits  * * *  spring[s] from the \nfundamental principle of the moral order in this \nsphere.\u201d Pet.App.433a (quoting Pope Saint John Paul \nII, Laborem Exercens (1981)). Prompted by and in ac-\ncordance with this teaching, the Wisconsin bishops \ncreated the Church Unemployment Pay Program \n(CUPP) \u201cto assist parishes, schools, and other church \nemployers in meeting their social justice responsibili-\nties by providing church funded unemployment cover-\nage.\u201d Pet.App.433a.  \nCUPP has long served the needs of employees \nthroughout Wisconsin without issue. CUPP provides \nthe same maximum weekly benefit rate as the State\u2019s \nsystem. Pet.App.438a. And, in some instances, an em-\nployee may receive a higher percentage of his salary \nthan in the State\u2019s system, while often receiving bene-\nfits more quickly. Compare ibid. (\u201c50% of the em-\nployee\u2019s average weekly gross wages\u201d) with Wis. Stat. \n\u00a7 108.06(1) (\u201c[N]o claimant may receive total benefits \nbased on employment in a base period greater than 26 \n\n12 \n \ntimes the claimant\u2019s weekly benefit rate  * * *  or 40 \npercent of the claimant\u2019s base period wages, whichever \nis lower.\u201d). And, unlike participants in the State\u2019s pro-\ngram, CUPP participants need not reapply for benefits \non a weekly basis. Pet.App.441a. Despite these ad-\nvantages, the Church can still operate CUPP \u201cmore ef-\nficiently at lesser cost,\u201d when compared to participa-\ntion in the State\u2019s program. Pet.App.149a, 448a, 478a. \nCatholic Charities has long sought to join CUPP. \nParticipating in the Catholic Church\u2019s unemployment \nprogram would bring Catholic Charities into align-\nment with the Diocese of Superior (which participates \nin CUPP) and allow Catholic Charities to direct addi-\ntional resources toward serving those in need.  \nThus, in 2004, Catholic Charities requested a reli-\ngious exemption from the State\u2019s system. It argued \nthat it was both controlled by a church and \u201coperated \nprimarily for religious purposes,\u201d as required by Sec-\ntion 108.02(15)(h)(2). This request was denied. \nPet.App.450a-463a. Then in 2016\u2014after one of Catho-\nlic Charities\u2019 sub-entities (not a Petitioner here) was \nheld to qualify for the religious exemption under Sec-\ntion 108.02(15)(h)(2), Pet.App.497a-504a\u2014Catholic \nCharities again sought an exemption from the Depart-\nment of Workforce Development. The Department \nfirst concluded that Petitioners are \u201coperated, super-\nvised, controlled or principally supported by a church.\u201d \nPet.App.352a, 356a, 360a, 364a, 368a. The Depart-\nment, however, then held that Catholic Charities was \nnot \u201coperated primarily for religious purposes,\u201d \nPet.App.351a-370a, and thus did not qualify for an ex-\nemption. Catholic Charities appealed. After a two-day \nhearing, an administrative law judge reversed, ruling \nfor Catholic Charities. Pet.App.291a-350a. \n\n13 \n \nThe Department then petitioned Respondent Labor \nand Industry Review Commission for review. The \nCommission reversed, holding that the religious ex-\nemption turns on an organization\u2019s \u201cactivities, not the \nreligious motivation behind them or the organization\u2019s \nfounding principles.\u201d Pet.App.227a, 242a, 258a, 273a, \n290a. And because Catholic Charities \u201cprovides essen-\ntially secular services and engages in activities that \nare not religious per se,\u201d the Commission concluded \nthat it does not qualify. Pet.App.226a, 241a, 257a, \n272a, 289a. \nD. Proceedings below \nAfter being denied a religious exemption by Wis-\nconsin, Catholic Charities sought review in Douglas \nCounty Circuit Court. The Circuit Court ruled for \nCatholic Charities, holding that under the \u201cplain lan-\nguage\u201d and \u201cplain meaning\u201d of the statute, \u201cthe test is \nreally why the organizations are operating, not what \nthey are operating.\u201d Pet.App.209a-210a. And since \nCatholic Charities operates out \u201cof th[e] religious mo-\ntive of the Catholic Church  * * *  of serving the under-\nserved,\u201d \nits \nprimary \npurposes \nare \nreligious. \nPet.App.209a. \nThe Department and the Commission appealed. \nThe Court of Appeals reversed the Circuit Court\u2019s or-\nder and reinstated the Commission\u2019s decision denying \nCatholic Charities an exemption. Pet.App.127a. The \nCourt of Appeals concluded that although Catholic \nCharities and its sub-entities \u201chave a professed reli-\ngious motivation  * * *  to fulfill the Catechism of the \nCatholic Church,\u201d their \u201cactivities  * * *  are the provi-\nsion of charitable social services that are neither in-\nherently \nor \nprimarily \nreligious \nactivities.\u201d \nPet.App.163a-165a. The Court of Appeals further held \n\n14 \n \nthat \u201cthe First Amendment is not implicated in this \ncase,\u201d rejecting Catholic Charities\u2019 constitutional ar-\nguments. Pet.App.127a, 157a-159a. \nCatholic Charities then petitioned the Wisconsin \nSupreme Court for review. After granting review, the \ncourt first recognized that Catholic Charities was \u201cop-\nerated, supervised, controlled, or principally sup-\nported by a church,\u201d satisfying the first requirement of \nSection 108.02(15)(h)(2). Pet.App.5a & n.3. But it then \nheld that determining whether Catholic Charities is \n\u201coperated primarily for religious purposes\u201d under Sec-\ntion 108.02(15)(h)(2) requires not just an inquiry into \nthe ministry\u2019s religious \u201cmotivations,\u201d but also a sepa-\nrate \u201cobjective inquiry\u201d into its \u201cactivities\u201d to deter-\nmine whether those activities are \u201c\u2018primarily\u2019 religious \nin nature.\u201d Pet.App.21a-22a, 26a-27a, 29a. On this \nscore, the court concluded that Catholic Charities\u2019 ac-\ntivities are not primarily religious \u201cin nature\u201d and \ntherefore denied it the Section 108.02(15)(h) religious \nexemption. Pet.App.32a-33a. \nRelying on United States v. Dykema, 666 F.2d 1096 \n(7th Cir. 1981), the court listed what it deemed \u201cobjec-\ntive\u201d criteria focused on \u201c[t]ypical\u201d forms of religious \nexercise. These included \u201ccorporate worship services,\u201d \n\u201cadministration of sacraments and observance of litur-\ngical rituals,\u201d \u201cpreaching ministry and evangelical out-\nreach to the unchurched and missionary activity in \npartibus infidelium,\u201d \u201cpastoral counseling,\u201d \u201cbaptism, \nmarriage, burial, and the like,\u201d and \u201ca system of nur-\nture of the young and education in the doctrine and \ndiscipline of the church[.]\u201d Pet.App.26a-27a (quoting \n\n15 \n \nDykema, 666 F.2d at 1100).2 The court explained, how-\never, that this list of \u201challmarks of a religious purpose \nare by no means exhaustive or necessary conditions \nand the listed activities may be different for different \nfaiths.\u201d Pet.App.27a. \nApplying this standard to Catholic Charities, the \ncourt acknowledged the parties\u2019 agreement that Cath-\nolic Charities\u2019 motivations for carrying out its ministry \nare primarily religious. Pet.App.29a. But, looking to \nwhether Catholic Charities \u201cparticipated in worship \nservices, religious outreach, ceremony, or religious ed-\nucation,\u201d the court determined that Catholic Charities\u2019 \n\u201cactivities are not \u2018primarily\u2019 religious in nature.\u201d Ibid. \nThe court observed that Catholic Charities does not \n\u201cattempt to imbue program participants with the \nCatholic faith nor supply any religious materials to \nprogram participants or employees.\u201d Ibid. Moreover, \nemployment with and services offered by Catholic \nCharities \u201care open to all participants regardless of re-\nligion.\u201d Pet.App.30a. \nThe court also concluded that Catholic Charities\u2019 \nprovision of \u201cservices to individuals with developmen-\ntal and mental health disabilities\u201d and \u201cbackground \nsupport and management services for these activities\u201d \n\u201care primarily charitable and secular.\u201d Pet.App.30a \n(describing portions of Catholic Charities\u2019 ministry as \n\u201ca wholly secular endeavor\u201d). The court bolstered its \nconclusion by suggesting that Catholic Charities\u2019 \u201cser-\nvices can be provided by organizations of either reli-\ngious or secular motivations, and the services provided \n \n2  \nDykema concerned whether an organization was \u201coperated \nexclusively for religious  * * *  purposes\u201d under 26 U.S.C. \n501(c)(3).  \n\n16 \n \nwould not differ in any sense.\u201d Pet.App.30a. The court \nthen rejected Catholic Charities\u2019 federal constitutional \narguments. Pet.App.40a-50a. \nJustice Rebecca Grassl Bradley, joined by Chief \nJustice Ziegler and in part by Justice Hagedorn, dis-\nsented. The dissent pointed out that \u201c[t]he majority ac-\ntually inquires whether Catholic Charities\u2019 activities \nare stereotypically religious.\u201d Pet.App.79a. It then \nnoted that the majority\u2019s test puts courts in the \u201ccon-\nstitutionally tenuous position of second-guessing the \nreligious significance and character of a nonprofit\u2019s ac-\ntions.\u201d Pet.App.116a. And it argued that the court\u2019s ap-\nproach \u201cbelittles Catholic Charities\u2019 faith\u2014and many \nother faith traditions\u2014by mischaracterizing their re-\nligiously motivated charitable activities as \u2018secular in \nnature\u2019\u2014that \nis, \nnot \nreally \nreligious \nat \nall.\u201d \nPet.App.83a (citation omitted). The dissent concluded \nthat the majority\u2019s approach\u2014asking whether an ac-\ntivity is \u201creligious in nature\u201d\u2014is an inherently entan-\ngling question. In the dissent\u2019s view, that approach \nwould force the court to \u201cstudy the doctrines of the var-\nious faiths and decide for itself what religious prac-\ntices are actually religious. The Constitution bars civil \ncourts from such intrusions into spiritual affairs.\u201d \nPet.App.117a. \nCatholic Charities then sought review in this \nCourt. \nSUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT \nThe Religion Clauses of the First Amendment work \ntogether to protect a sphere of religious independence \nfree from government control and to prevent discrimi-\nnation against particular forms of religious exercise. \nThis dual aspect of the Religion Clauses makes clear \n\n17 \n \nthat Wisconsin\u2019s exclusion of Catholic Charities from \nthe Section 108.02(15)(h) religious exemption is un-\nconstitutional in at least three ways. \nFirst, it violates the principle of church autonomy \nby penalizing Catholic Charities because of its struc-\nture, including the fact that it is separately incorpo-\nrated from the Diocese of Superior. It would violate \nCatholic social teaching to force Catholic Charities to \nbe \u201cabsorbed and substituted\u201d by \u201csocial entities of a \nhigher level.\u201d Compendium of the Social Doctrine of \nthe Church \u00b6 186. Wisconsin\u2019s decision to deny Catho-\nlic Charities the Section 108.02(15)(h) exemption un-\nless it merges with the Diocese thus penalizes it for \nfollowing specific Catholic teachings about church gov-\nernance. In a host of church autonomy decisions \nstretching back over a century, this Court has rejected \nsimilar attempts by state governments to meddle with \nthe inner workings of churches. The Religion Clauses, \nworking together, protect religious bodies\u2019 \u201cindepend-\nence from secular control or manipulation, in short, \npower to decide for themselves, free from state inter-\nference, matters of church government as well as those \nof faith and doctrine.\u201d Kedroff v. Saint Nicholas Cathe-\ndral of Russian Orthodox Church in N. Am., 344 U.S. \n94, 116 (1952). And once church authorities decide a \nquestion of church government, \u201cthe Constitution re-\nquires that civil courts accept their decisions as bind-\ning upon them.\u201d Serbian E. Orthodox Diocese for U.S. \nof Am. & Can. v. Milivojevich, 426 U.S. 696, 725 \n(1976). \nSecond, Wisconsin\u2019s exclusion of Catholic Charities \nviolates the Religion Clauses\u2019 prohibition on imper-\nmissible entanglement of church and state. The Reli-\ngion Clauses do not allow \u201cactive involvement of the \n\n18 \n \nsovereign in religious activity.\u201d Walz v. Tax Comm\u2019n of \nN.Y., 397 U.S. 664, 668 (1970). Nor do they allow gov-\nernments (including courts) to decide whether reli-\ngious institutions \u201ccorrectly perceive[ ] the commands\u201d \nof their religion, Thomas v. Review Board, 450 U.S. \n707, 716 (1981), or to \u201csecond-guess\u201d their beliefs, Our \nLady of Guadalupe School v. Morrissey-Berru, 591 \nU.S. 732, 751 (2020). Yet here, Wisconsin has taken it \nupon itself to override the Catholic Church\u2019s beliefs \nabout whether (for example) helping those with devel-\nopmental disabilities is a religious act, and to force \nCatholic Charities to participate in the State\u2019s unem-\nployment compensation system on that basis. That is \nentanglement forbidden by the Constitution. \nThird, by denying Catholic Charities the Section \n108.02(15)(h) religious exemption, Wisconsin is dis-\ncriminating among religions. Under the Wisconsin Su-\npreme Court\u2019s test, religious groups that serve only \nthose of their own faith or that proselytize can obtain \nthe tax exemption, as can religious groups with a sim-\npler internal structure. But Catholic Charities cannot \nenjoy the tax exemption because it follows particular \nCatholic beliefs and has a particular Catholic polity. \nThat cannot be squared with the rule against denomi-\nnational discrimination articulated in Larson v. \nValente, 456 U.S. 228 (1982) and Church of Lukumi \nBabalu Aye, Inc. v. City of Hialeah, 508 U.S. 520, 532 \n(1993). \nAny one of Wisconsin\u2019s three violations of the Reli-\ngion Clauses would suffice to invalidate Wisconsin\u2019s \ndenial of the tax exemption; together the case is over-\nwhelming. \n\n19 \n \nARGUMENT \nThe Religion Clauses prohibit Wisconsin from se-\nlectively excluding Catholic Charities from the Section \n108.02(15)(h) religious exemption. Both Clauses work-\ning together do not allow government interference \nwith church governance, government entanglement \nwith religious questions, or unjustified discrimination \namong religious groups. \nI. The Religion Clauses work together to \nprotect \nboth \nhow \nreligious \ninstitutions \ngovern themselves inwardly and how those \ninstitutions act outwardly. \n1. The very first part of the First Amendment has \ntypically been referred to as the \u201cReligion Clauses.\u201d In \nthe lower courts, religion-related claims are typically \nbrought under either the Establishment Clause or the \nFree Exercise Clause.3  But as this Court has ex-\nplained, the Religion Clauses \u201cappear in the same sen-\ntence of the same Amendment\u201d and therefore a \u201cnatu-\nral reading of that sentence\u201d indicates that the \nClauses have \u201c\u2018complementary\u2019 purposes, not warring \nones.\u201d Kennedy v. Bremerton Sch. Dist., 597 U.S. 507, \n533 (2022) (quoting Everson v. Board of Educ., 330 \nU.S. 1, 13, 15 (1947)). At the very least, that means \nthat the two Clauses ought to be read in pari materia, \nlike other provisions of the Constitution. See, e.g., Pat-\nton v. United States, 281 U.S. 276, 298 (1930), abro-\ngated on other grounds, Williams v. Florida, 399 U.S. \n78, 92 (1970) (\u201cThe first ten amendments and the orig-\ninal Constitution were substantially contemporaneous \n \n3  \nThe Religion Clauses are also frequently offered as defenses, \nbut for ease of discussion in this section we refer to just \u201cclaims\u201d \nrather than \u201cclaims or defenses.\u201d \n\n20 \n \nand should be construed in pari materia.\u201d). But the \nClauses\u2019 complementariness also means\u2014as this \nCourt has recognized\u2014that some religion-related \nFirst Amendment claims are rooted in both Clauses. \nSee, e.g., Hosanna-Tabor Evangelical Lutheran \nChurch & Sch. v. EEOC, 565 U.S. 171, 190 (2012) \n(\u201c[T]here is a ministerial exception grounded in the \nReligion Clauses of the First Amendment.\u201d). \nThis means that that the set of all Religion Clauses \nclaims can be divided into three parts: claims based on \nthe Free Exercise Clause alone, claims based on the \nEstablishment Clause alone, and claims rooted in both \nReligion Clauses.  \nCases in which this Court resolved claims only un-\nder the Free Exercise Clause include Fulton v. City of \nPhiladelphia, 593 U.S. 522 (2021), Tandon v. Newsom, \n593 U.S. 61 (2021), Thomas v. Review Board, and Wis-\nconsin v. Yoder, 406 U.S. 205 (1972), among many oth-\ners. Some of the claims in this category are subject to \nthe rule of Employment Division v. Smith, 494 U.S. \n872 (1990), but many fall outside Smith. Compare, \ne.g., Lukumi, 508 U.S. at 531 (following Smith\u2019s rule \nof neutrality and general applicability) with Carson v. \nMakin, 596 U.S. 767 (2022) (no mention of Smith). \nThe second category involves Establishment \nClause claims like those addressed by this Court in \nAmerican Legion v. American Humanist Association, \n588 U.S. 29 (2019) and Town of Greece v. Galloway, \n572 U.S. 565 (2014). Those claims are now governed \nby the \u201chistorical practices and understandings\u201d \nstandard first announced in Town of Greece and later \nelaborated in Kennedy. See Kennedy, 597 U.S. at 537 \n(discussing \u201challmarks of religious establishments the \n\n21 \n \nframers sought to prohibit when they adopted the \nFirst Amendment\u201d).  \nThe third category of claims, those rooted in both \nClauses, includes not just ministerial exception de-\nfenses like those in Hosanna-Tabor and Our Lady, but \nalso claims related to church property and governance \ndisputes, as in Gonzalez v. Roman Catholic Arch-\nbishop of Manila, 280 U.S. 1 (1929). These claims are \ngoverned in large part by the standard first laid out in \nWatson v. Jones, 80 U.S. (13 Wall.) 679 (1872), and \nlater constitutionalized in Kedroff. And while claims \nin this third category comport with, and are directly \nderived from, \u201chistorical practices and understand-\nings\u201d in the sense of Kennedy, they are not subject to \nthe ahistorical Smith standard. See Hosanna-Tabor, \n565 U.S. at 190. \n2. Although these three categories of Religion \nClauses claims often manifest differently in different \ncases, there are some common themes that can be di-\nvined, particularly as related to religious institutional \nlitigants like Catholic Charities.  \nFirst, government cannot interfere with the inner \nworkings of religious institutions. That reflects \u201cthe \ngeneral principle of church autonomy\u201d which guaran-\ntees \u201cindependence in matters of faith and doctrine \nand in closely linked matters of internal government.\u201d \nOur Lady, 591 U.S. at 747. Indeed, any government \naction that \u201cpenetrates deeply into the internal af-\nfairs\u201d of a religious body is prohibited by the Constitu-\ntion. Larson, 456 U.S. at 253 n.29, 255. \nSecond, the Religion Clauses also protect religious \ninstitutions\u2019 sphere of internal control by ensuring \n\n22 \n \nthat government cannot get entangled in religious af-\nfairs. Thus, no government entity can second-guess re-\nligious judgments made by religious institutions. That \nis because \u201cit is no business of courts to say that what \nis a religious practice or activity for one group is not \nreligion under the protection of the First Amendment.\u201d \nFowler v. Rhode Island, 345 U.S. 67, 70 (1953). In-\nstead, courts and all other secular authorities must \navoid making \u201cdetermination[s]\u201d that \u201cimplicate[ ] \nvery sensitive questions of faith and tradition.\u201d NLRB \nv. Catholic Bishop, 440 U.S. 490, 495 (1979).  \nThird, Religion Clauses cases consistently prevent \ndiscrimination by government against religious insti-\ntutions\u2014whether in the form of discrimination be-\ntween religious and nonreligious institutions or dis-\ncrimination among different religious institutions. As \nthe Court has repeatedly put it, discrimination against \nreligious bodies because they are religious or because \nthey do religious things is \u201codious to our Constitution\u201d \nand cannot stand. Carson, 596 U.S. at 779 (quoting \nTrinity Lutheran Church of Columbia, Inc. v. Comer, \n582 U.S. 449, 467 (2017)). Likewise, government can-\nnot \u201cprefer one religion over another.\u201d Larson, 456 \nU.S. at 246 (invalidating facially neutral but opera-\ntively discriminatory exemption for religious organiza-\ntions). Cf. Murphy v. Collier, 139 S. Ct. 1475, 1475 \n(2019) (Kavanaugh, J., concurring) (\u201cThe government \nmay not discriminate against religion generally or \nagainst particular religious denominations.\u201d).  \nAs a result, the Religion Clauses together protect \nboth how religious institutions govern themselves in-\nwardly and how those institutions act outwardly. That \nis a direct analogue to the First Amendment\u2019s protec-\n\n23 \n \ntion of the conscience of religious individuals. For in-\ndividuals, the inward sphere of conscience must be left \n\u201cabsolute[ly]\u201d inviolate so that the religious individual \ncan freely determine what she believes to be true with \nrespect to the transcendent. Cantwell v. Connecticut, \n310 U.S. 296, 303-304 (1940). In the same way, the in-\nternal processes by which religious bodies determine \nwhat they believe\u2014that is, how a religious body forms \nits own conscience\u2014must also remain free from gov-\nernment interference. And for both individuals and in-\nstitutions, there is protection for outward physical acts \nas well, but \u201cin the nature of things,\u201d the \u201cfreedom to \nact\u201d on conscience is not as absolute as the inward free-\ndom to form one\u2019s conscience. Cantwell, 310 U.S. at \n303-304. The outward \u201cfreedom to act\u201d may not be \u201cin-\nfringe[d]\u201d without compelling reason, but it cannot es-\ncape \u201cregulation for the protection of society\u201d alto-\ngether. Id. at 304. \nImportantly, however, the Court has firmly re-\njected the idea that government can force a trade-off \nbetween these two aspects of religious institutional \nfreedom. Government cannot require religious institu-\ntions to relinquish their inner freedom to operate in \naccordance with their beliefs as the price of their out-\nward freedom to participate fully in society. For exam-\nple, government cannot force a church to \u201crenounce its \nreligious character in order to participate in an other-\nwise generally available public benefit program, for \nwhich it is fully qualified.\u201d Trinity Lutheran, 582 U.S. \nat 466. See also Espinoza v. Montana Dep\u2019t of Revenue, \n591 U.S. 464, 478 (2020) (\u201ccondition[ing] the availabil-\nity of benefits upon a recipient\u2019s willingness to surren-\nder  * * *  religiously impelled status\u201d impermissible); \nFellowship of Christian Athletes v. San Jose Unified \nSch. Dist. Bd. of Educ., 82 F.4th 664, 687 (9th Cir. \n\n24 \n \n2023) (en banc) (cannot force religious student group \nto renounce its beliefs to obtain official recognition). \nII. The Religion Clauses forbid Wisconsin from \nselectively denying the religious exemption \nto Catholic Charities.  \nWisconsin\u2019s arbitrary exclusion of Catholic Chari-\nties from the religious exemption violates the Religion \nClauses in three ways: church autonomy, entangle-\nment of church and state, and discrimination among \nreligions. \nA. Wisconsin\u2019s \nexclusion \nof \nCatholic \nCharities violates the principle of church \nautonomy by interfering with internal \nchurch government. \n1. The United States Constitution guarantees reli-\ngious bodies \u201cindependence from secular control or \nmanipulation, in short, power to decide for them-\nselves, free from state interference, matters of church \ngovernment as well as those of faith and doctrine.\u201d \nKedroff, 344 U.S. at 116. The Court has described this \nsphere of protection for internal church affairs as \u201cthe \ngeneral principle of church autonomy\u201d or \u201cindepend-\nence in matters of faith and doctrine and in closely \nlinked matters of internal government.\u201d Our Lady, 591 \nU.S. at 747. These questions of \u201cinternal government\u201d \ninclude the control of church property, see Presbyter-\nian Church in U.S. v. Mary Elizabeth Blue Hull Me-\nmorial Presbyterian Church, 393 U.S. 440, 449 (1969), \nthe appointment and authority of clergy, Gonzalez, \n280 U.S. at 16-17, replacing church administrators, \nKedroff, 344 U.S. at 119, and the hiring and firing of \nparochial school teachers, Hosanna-Tabor, 565 U.S. at \n196, among many other issues. See Serbian, 426 U.S. \n\n25 \n \nat 713-714 (\u201c[C]ivil courts exercise no jurisdiction[ ] in \na matter which concerns theological controversy, \nchurch discipline, ecclesiastical government, or the \nconformity of the members of the church to the stand-\nard of morals required of them.\u201d). \nEspecially relevant here, the church autonomy doc-\ntrine prevents government interference in matters of \npolity or church government\u2014that is, how the reli-\ngious body has organized itself. The issue arose on two \noccasions during the early Republic, in the administra-\ntions of Presidents Jefferson and Madison. Jefferson \naddressed the issue of religious autonomy in response \nto a letter from the Ursuline Sisters of New Orleans. \nAs part of the Louisiana Purchase, New Orleans had \nrecently come under the government of the United \nStates, and the Sisters were concerned about the secu-\nrity of their property under the new regime. Jefferson \nreassured the Sisters in response, writing that \u201cyour \ninstitution will be permitted to govern itself according \nto it\u2019s own voluntary rules, without interference from \nthe civil authority.\u201d Letter from President Thomas Jef-\nferson to the Ursuline Sisters (July 13, 1804), \nhttps://founders.archives.gov/documents/Jefferson/01-\n44-02-0064 (punctuation as in original). Jefferson con-\ntinued: \u201cwhatever diversity of shade may appear in the \nreligious opinions of our fellow citizens, the charitable \nobjects of your institution cannot be indifferent to \nany;  * * *  be assured it will meet all the protection \nwhich my office can give it.\u201d Ibid.  \nIn 1811, Madison vetoed an Act of Congress that \nwould have incorporated an Anglican church in federal \nterritory. In his veto message, Madison explained that \nthe civil law Congress sought to enact impinged on the \n\n26 \n \nability of the church to freely express its chosen reli-\ngious polity: \u201cThe bill enacts into, and establishes by \nlaw, sundry rules and proceedings relative purely to \nthe organization and polity of the church incorpo-\nrated.\u201d 22 Annals of Cong. 983 (1811). Importantly to \nMadison, the bill would have made it \u201cso that no \nchange could be made therein by the particular soci-\nety, or by the general church of which it is a member, \nand whose authority it recognises.\u201d Ibid. In Madison\u2019s \nview, then, civil corporate laws could not be written in \na way that restricted the ability of the church to ex-\npress its religious polity in accordance with its beliefs. \nSee Michael W. McConnell, The Supreme Court\u2019s Ear-\nliest Church-State Cases: Windows on Religious-Cul-\ntural-Political Conflict in the Early Republic, 37 Tulsa \nL. Rev. 7, 15 (2001) (discussing Madison\u2019s views). \nThe Court\u2019s subsequent decisions regarding polity \nhave consistently recognized that state corporate gov-\nernance laws ought to accommodate religious polity. \nJustice Story adverted to this in Terrett v. Taylor, \nholding that the carrying out of \u201creligious duties\u201d by \n\u201cvotaries of every sect\u201d \u201ccould be better secured and \ncherished by corporate powers.\u201d 13 U.S. (9 Cranch) 43, \n49 (1815).4 And in Watson, the Court treated freedom \nof church government as a fundamental premise of its \ndecision: \u201cThe right to organize voluntary religious as-\nsociations to assist in the expression and dissemina-\n \n4  \nRecent lower court Religion Clauses decisions have invali-\ndated state constitutional provisions that barred churches from \nincorporating. See Falwell v. Miller, 203 F. Supp. 2d 624, 632 \n(W.D. Va. 2002) (Virginia); Hope Cmty. Church v. Warner, \nNo. 3:23-cv-231, 2024 WL 4310866, at *2 (N.D. W.Va. Sept. 26, \n2024) (West Virginia). \n\n27 \n \ntion of any religious doctrine,  * * *  and for the eccle-\nsiastical government of all the individual members, \ncongregations, and officers within the general associa-\ntion, is unquestioned.\u201d Watson, 80 U.S. at 728-729 \n(emphasis added). After reviewing state law decisions \nprotecting the freedom of church government, the \nCourt rejected the effort of trustees of a breakaway \ncongregation to sever ties with the broader Presbyter-\nian church.5 \nThe Court addressed the constitutionality of state-\nlaw restrictions on church government head-on in \nKedroff, describing the central issue as \u201cstrictly a mat-\nter of ecclesiastical government, the power of the Su-\npreme Church Authority of the Russian Orthodox \nChurch to appoint the ruling hierarch of the archdio-\ncese of North America.\u201d Kedroff, 344 U.S. at 115. \nThere, New York enacted a statute that would trans-\nfer control of the Russian Orthodox cathedral in New \nYork City from the Soviet-controlled Russian Ortho-\ndox Church to an American-based Orthodox church. \nId. at 98. The Court invalidated the New York statute. \nRelying on Watson, it defined \u201cfreedom for religious or-\nganizations\u201d as the \u201cpower to decide  * * *  matters of \nchurch government as well as those of faith and doc-\ntrine.\u201d Id. at 116. By distinguishing \u201cchurch govern-\nment\u201d from \u201cfaith and doctrine,\u201d the Court made clear \nthat the organization of a church\u2014its government or \npolity\u2014was itself off-limits to secular control. And \nwhere the corporate laws of a state came into conflict \nwith the church\u2019s chosen polity, those corporate laws \n \n5  \nThis effort was one instance of the broader \u201cTrusteeship Con-\ntroversy\u201d that particularly but not exclusively affected the Cath-\nolic Church during the 19th Century. See McConnell, 37 Tulsa L. \nRev. at 34-35.  \n\n28 \n \nhad to give way. That proved equally true of judicial \ninterference \nwith \nthe \ninternal \ngovernment \nof \nchurches. See Kreshik v. Saint Nicholas Cathedral, \n363 U.S. 190, 191 (1960) (\u201c[I]t is not of moment that \nthe State has here acted solely through its judicial \nbranch, for whether legislative or judicial, it is still the \napplication of state power which we are asked to scru-\ntinize.\u201d). \nThe Court vigorously reiterated the point in Ser-\nbian, which concerned challenges to both the defrock-\ning of a bishop and the reorganization of dioceses of \nthe Serbian Orthodox Church in the United States. \n426 U.S. at 708. The Illinois Supreme Court held that \nboth the defrocking and the reorganization were im-\nproper under that court\u2019s interpretation and applica-\ntion of the Serbian Orthodox Church\u2019s constitution \nand penal code. This Court reversed, holding that the \nIllinois Supreme Court\u2019s decision in favor of the de-\nfrocked bishop and against diocesan reorganization \n\u201crests upon an impermissible rejection of the decisions \nof the highest ecclesiastical tribunals of this hierar-\nchical church upon the issues in dispute, and imper-\nmissibly substitutes its own inquiry into church polity \nand resolutions based thereon of those disputes.\u201d Id. \nat 708.  \nSpecifically as to the second disputed issue in the \ncase\u2014whether a single diocese of the Serbian Ortho-\ndox Church ought to be split into three\u2014the Court \nheld that \u201cthe Supreme Court of Illinois substituted its \ninterpretation of the Diocesan and Mother Church \nconstitutions for that of the highest ecclesiastical tri-\nbunals in which church law vests authority to make \nthat interpretation. This the First and Fourteenth \nAmendments forbid.\u201d Serbian, 426 U.S. at 721. The \n\n29 \n \nCourt rejected any detailed discussion of the church \nconstitutions, saying that \u201c[i]t suffices to note that the \nreorganization of the Diocese involves a matter of in-\nternal church government, an issue at the core of ec-\nclesiastical affairs; Arts. 57 and 64 of the Mother \nChurch constitution commit such questions of church \npolity to the final province of the Holy Assembly.\u201d Ibid. \nIn short, when church authorities decide a question of \nchurch government, \u201cthe Constitution requires that \ncivil courts accept their decisions as binding upon \nthem.\u201d Id. at 725. \n2. Wisconsin\u2019s rule baldly violates these principles. \nThere is no dispute that Catholic Charities is part and \nparcel of the Roman Catholic Church and an arm of \nthe Diocese of Superior. Pet.App.213a. Yet Wisconsin \neffectively severs Catholic Charities from the broader \nchurch in order to exclude Catholic Charities from the \nreligious exemption. That violates the Religion \nClauses in at least two ways. \nFirst, Wisconsin\u2019s refusal to extend the exemption \nto Catholic Charities penalizes the Church for how it \nhas organized its ministry. There is no dispute that if \nCatholic Charities and the Diocese were a single non-\nprofit corporation, that corporation would be exempt. \nAnd there is no dispute that the Diocese\u2019s decision to \nincorporate separate bodies, rooted in Catholic princi-\nples of subsidiarity, is a \u201cquestion[ ] of church polity.\u201d \nSerbian, 426 U.S. at 721; see also Compendium of the \nSocial Doctrine of the Church \u00b6\u00b6 186-187. Put another \nway, forcing the Diocese to fully merge Catholic Char-\nities and the Diocese in order to obtain the benefit of \nthe religious exemption restructures the polity of the \nCatholic Church in Wisconsin just as much as the Illi-\nnois Supreme Court in Serbian tried to restructure the \n\n30 \n \npolity of the Serbian Orthodox Church. See 426 U.S. \nat 709. Such a decision \u201caffects the faith and mission \nof the church itself.\u201d Hosanna-Tabor, 565 U.S. at 190. \nThe Wisconsin Supreme Court did not deny this \npoint, instead saying it was \u201cunpersuasive\u201d because \nthe lower court could \u201cimagine a non-profit organiza-\ntion structured as a separate sub-entity of a \nchurch  * * *  with both motivations and activities \nthat are religious.\u201d Pet.App.46a. That dodges the ques-\ntion. If Catholic Charities were\u2014contrary to its prin-\nciples of religious polity\u2014folded into the Diocese itself, \nthen it would qualify for the religious exemption under \nSection 108.02(15)(h)(1) as a \u201cchurch.\u201d It is no answer \nto shrink the aperture and look at only one part of the \nstatutory exemption regime being challenged.  \nSecond, in deciding whether Catholic Charities is \n\u201coperated primarily for religious purposes,\u201d Wisconsin \nrefuses to consider the Diocese\u2019s purposes in setting up \nand operating Catholic Charities, focusing solely on \nwhat it considers to be Catholic Charities\u2019 \u201cpurposes.\u201d \nLeave to one side the undisputed fact that the \u201creason \nthat [Petitioners] administer these social service pro-\ngrams is for a religious purpose: to fulfill the Cate-\nchism of the Catholic Church.\u201d Pet.App.163a-164a. \nCatholic Charities does not have a separate purpose \nfrom the Diocese. It is specifically designed and oper-\nated to carry out the Diocese\u2019s religious purposes to as-\nsist the needy in northern Wisconsin. By putting asun-\nder what the Catholic Church believes belongs to-\ngether, Wisconsin has subjected the Church to forbid-\nden \u201csecular control or manipulation.\u201d Kedroff, 344 \nU.S. at 116. As this Court explained in Our Lady, reli-\ngious entities have \u201cautonomy\u201d with respect to \u201cinter-\nnal management decisions\u201d that affect their \u201ccentral \n\n31 \n \nmission.\u201d 591 U.S. at 746. In the same way that choos-\ning who can serve as a minister is one such \u201cinternal \nmanagement decision,\u201d determining how to minister \nto those in need is another. Ibid. And indeed, Wiscon-\nsin\u2019s interference doesn\u2019t end there\u2014similar princi-\nples of church autonomy prohibit Wisconsin\u2019s interfer-\nence in Catholic Charities\u2019 decisions about whom to \nhire, whom to serve, and whether to proselytize. See, \ne.g., Hosanna-Tabor, 565 U.S. at 187 (\u201c[T]he First \nAmendment \u2018permit[s] hierarchical religious organiza-\ntions to establish their own rules and regulations for \ninternal discipline and government\u2019\u201d); Our Lady, 591 \nU.S. at 746 (recognizing \u201cindependence of religious in-\nstitutions in matters of \u2018faith and doctrine\u2019\u201d).  \n3. This is not to say that the law can never make \ndistinctions among differently structured religious en-\ntities. Indeed, sometimes social facts mean the law \nmust do so to remain compliant with the Religion \nClauses. For example, the Internal Revenue Code \nrightfully recognizes that a \u201cminister of a church\u201d is \ndifferent from a \u201cmember of a religious order,\u201d 26 \nU.S.C. 1402(c)(4), or for that matter a \u201cChristian Sci-\nence practitioner,\u201d 26 U.S.C. 1402(c)(5).  \nMoreover, where necessary the law can and ought \nto flexibly accommodate the different kinds of religious \ngroupings in the United States. Thus, for tax purposes, \nmany rabbis count as \u201cminister[s] of the gospel,\u201d which \nenables their synagogues to provide them with a tax-\nexempt housing allowance on the same terms as Chris-\ntian houses of worship. See, e.g., Libman v. Commis-\nsioner, 44 T.C.M. (CCH) 370 (1982) (applying 26 \nU.S.C. 107 parsonage allowance to rabbi). Such dis-\n\n32 \n \ntinctions further religious autonomy rather than hin-\ndering it. Indeed, failure to account for different reli-\ngious polities would risk religious discrimination. \nThe problems arise where distinctions among reli-\ngious polities result in government disfavor of certain \nreligions or religious entities. A prominent example of \nthis came in the contraceptive mandate litigation, \nwhere the federal government created a \u201cchurch ex-\nemption\u201d from the mandate that exempts certain non-\nprofit entities from filing annual tax returns, includ-\ning \u201cchurches, their integrated auxiliaries, and con-\nventions or associations of churches\u201d and \u201cthe exclu-\nsively religious activities of any religious order.\u201d 76 \nFed. Reg. 46,621 46,623 (Aug. 3, 2011). This narrow \nexemption created enormous problems for religious or-\nders that were not engaged in \u201cexclusively religious ac-\ntivities\u201d as defined by the government, including, for \nexample, the Little Sisters of the Poor. See Little Sis-\nters of the Poor Saints Peter & Paul Home v. Pennsyl-\nvania, 591 U.S. 657, 689 (2020) (Alito, J., concurring). \nThe same would be true in other contexts\u2014if the IRS \ndenied a rabbi the use of the parsonage allowance un-\nder 26 U.S.C. 107 because he did not count as a \u201cmin-\nister of the gospel,\u201d the rabbi\u2019s synagogue could bring \na church autonomy claim against the government.  \nIn short, where government distinctions among re-\nligious polities move from recognizing and accommo-\ndating those polities to penalizing religious bodies for \ntheir form of church government, they contravene the \nprinciples of church autonomy, free exercise, and reli-\ngious neutrality in violation of the Religion Clauses. \nAnd here, there is no question that Wisconsin has pe-\nnalized the Diocese and Catholic Charities for sepa-\nrately incorporating Catholic Charities in accordance \n\n33 \n \nwith its sincere religious beliefs about proper church \npolity.  \nB. Wisconsin\u2019s \nexclusion \nof \nCatholic \nCharities entangles church and state.  \n1. As with church autonomy, the rule against im-\npermissible government entanglement in religion is \nrooted in both Religion Clauses. On the Establishment \nClause side, this constitutional prohibition ensures \nthat government does not become actively involved in \nreligious matters\u2014including answering religious \nquestions\u2014and government officials do not second-\nguess religious organizations\u2019 answers to questions of \nreligious belief. \nAs this Court explained in Walz, the Establishment \nClause was originally understood to forbid, among \nother things, \u201cactive involvement of the sovereign in \nreligious activity.\u201d Walz, 397 U.S. at 668; see Stepha-\nnie H. Barclay, Untangling Entanglement, 97 Wash. \nU. L. Rev. 1701, 1704 (2020) (finding historical support \nfor the doctrine of entanglement \u201cwhen it has pro-\ntected religious groups from government interference \nwith the[ir] autonomy, internal affairs, and admin-\nistration\u201d). Thus, government actions that require a \n\u201ccontinuing day-to-day relationship\u201d between church \nand state, and that have as their \u201ceffect  * * *  an ex-\ncessive government entanglement with religion,\u201d are \nunconstitutional. Walz, 397 U.S. at 674.  \nIn practice, this means that government officials \ncannot second-guess or purport to resolve disputed re-\nligious questions without running afoul of the Consti-\ntution. As this Court put it in New York v. Cathedral \nAcademy, the \u201cprospect of church and state litigating \nin court about what does or does not have religious \n\n34 \n \nmeaning touches the very core of the constitutional \nguarantee against religious establishment.\u201d 434 U.S. \n125, 133 (1977). And this same principle has been re-\naffirmed in numerous other contexts. E.g., Widmar v. \nVincent, 454 U.S. 263, 272 n.11 (1981) (determining \n\u201cwhich words and activities fall within \u2018religious wor-\nship and religious teaching\u2019  * * *  could prove \u2018an im-\npossible task\u2019\u201d and would create a \u201ccontinuing need to \nmonitor group meetings to ensure compliance\u201d); \nMitchell v. Helms, 530 U.S. 793, 828 (2000) (plurality \nopinion) (prohibition on entanglement requires civil \ncourts to \u201crefrain from trolling through a person\u2019s or \ninstitution\u2019s religious beliefs\u201d); Colorado Christian \nUniv. v. Weaver, 534 F.3d 1245, 1261 (10th Cir. 2008) \n(McConnell, J.) (prohibition on entanglement \u201cprotects \nreligious institutions from governmental monitoring \nor second-guessing of their religious beliefs and prac-\ntices\u201d). \nThis prohibition on government entanglement can \nbe traced back to this Court\u2019s first modern pronounce-\nments on the meaning of the Establishment Clause. \nE.g., Everson, 330 U.S. at 16 (\u201cNeither a state nor the \nFederal Government can, openly or secretly, partici-\npate in the affairs of any religious organizations or \ngroups and vice versa.\u201d); Barclay, 97 Wash. U. L. Rev. \nat 1705 (\u201c[I]t is the 1948 decision in Illinois ex rel. \nMcCollum that marks the Supreme Court\u2019s first use of \n\u2018entanglement\u2019 as a legal test to assess Establishment \nClause violations.\u201d); Colorado Christian, 534 F.3d at \n1261 (\u201c[T]he prohibition on entanglements was formu-\nlated as an independent requirement of the Establish-\nment Clause.\u201d). And while this Court recently jetti-\nsoned the Lemon test (which incorporated \u201cexcessive \nentanglement\u201d as its third prong), it is no surprise that \n\n35 \n \nthis independent prohibition on government entangle-\nment, which long pre-dated Lemon, has remained. See, \ne.g., Carson, 596 U.S. at 787 (recognizing \u201cconcerns \nabout state entanglement with religion and denomina-\ntional favoritism\u201d); Our Lady, 591 U.S. at 761 (\u201cdeter-\nmining \nwhether \na \nperson \nis \na \n\u2018co-religion-\nist\u2019  * * *  would risk judicial entanglement in reli-\ngious issues\u201d). \n2. The prohibition on religious entanglement also \nflows from the Free Exercise Clause\u2014specifically, \nfrom the freedom of religious individuals and organi-\nzations to determine their religious beliefs and mis-\nsion without government coercion, interference, or un-\ndue influence.  \nIn NLRB v. Catholic Bishop, for example, this \nCourt explained that the NLRB\u2019s assertion of jurisdic-\ntion over certain religious secondary schools entangled \nthe Board in \u201cvery sensitive questions of faith and tra-\ndition.\u201d 440 U.S. at 495-496. While the Board claimed \nit could resolve \u201conly factual issues,\u201d this Court recog-\nnized that for the religious plaintiffs, \u201cresolu-\ntion  * * *  by the Board, in many instances, will nec-\nessarily involve inquiry into the good faith of the posi-\ntion asserted by the clergy-administrators and its re-\nlationship to the school\u2019s religious mission.\u201d Id. at 502. \nIn other words, even matters which government might \nconsider secular can be infused with religious mean-\ning\u2014especially in the context of a religious entity\u2019s \nmission.  \nThis Court also explained that it was not just the \nBoard\u2019s ultimate conclusions that would be entan-\ngling; instead, \u201cthe very process of inquiry\u201d required \nsignificant government involvement in the school\u2019s op-\n\n36 \n \nerations such that this Court saw \u201cno escape from con-\nflicts flowing from the Board\u2019s exercise of jurisdiction \nover teachers in church-operated schools,\u201d which \nwould result in \u201cserious First Amendment questions.\u201d \nCatholic Bishop, 440 U.S. at 502-504; see id. at 502 \n(NLRB\u2019s jurisdiction would result in \u201centanglement \nwith the religious mission of the school in the setting \nof mandatory collective bargaining.\u201d); see generally \nUniversidad Cent. de Bayamon v. NLRB, 793 F.2d \n383, 402 (1st Cir. 1985) (Breyer, J., writing for an \nequally divided en banc court) (applying Catholic \nBishop to conclude that the NLRB cannot exercise ju-\nrisdiction over a Catholic college because religious val-\nues may \u201cpermeate the educational process\u201d); Univer-\nsity of Great Falls v. NLRB, 278 F.3d 1335, 1341 (D.C. \nCir. 2002) (applying Catholic Bishop to conclude that \nNLRB\u2019s \u201csubstantial religious character\u201d requirement \nwould still lead to an \u201cintrusive inquiry\u201d that entan-\ngles church and state). \nIn addition to Catholic Bishop, this Court has re-\npeatedly struck down legal standards that require a \nsearching inquiry into, or a second-guessing of, sincere \nreligious beliefs. In Thomas, this Court held that it \nwas not \u201cwithin the judicial function and judicial com-\npetence to inquire whether the petitioner or his fellow \nworker more correctly perceived the commands of \ntheir common faith.\u201d Thomas, 450 U.S. at 716. And in \nCorporation of Presiding Bishop v. Amos, the Court \nheld that \u201cit is a significant burden on a religious or-\nganization to require it, on pain of substantial liabil-\nity, to predict which of its activities a secular court will \nconsider religious. The line is hardly a bright one, and \nan organization might understandably be concerned \nthat a judge would not understand its religious tenets \nand sense of mission.\u201d 483 U.S. 327, 336 (1987). And \n\n37 \n \nin Our Lady, this Court repudiated the Ninth Circuit\u2019s \nattempt to \u201csecond-guess\u201d the Catholic Church\u2019s \u201cjudg-\nment\u201d regarding the amount of formal religious school-\ning necessary to teach at a Catholic secondary school \nand similarly rejected a \u201cco-religionist\u201d requirement \nfor the ministerial exception as too entangling. Our \nLady, 591 U.S. at 759-761. See also Fowler, 345 U.S. \nat 70 (\u201c[I]t is no business of courts to say that what is \na religious practice or activity for one group is not re-\nligion under the protection of the First Amendment.\u201d). \nAs Justices Alito and Kagan explained in Hosanna-Ta-\nbor, the \u201cmere adjudication of such questions\u201d\u2014even \napart from the conclusions that a court might reach\u2014\n\u201cwould pose grave problems for religious autonomy.\u201d \n565 U.S. at 205-206 (Alito, J., concurring). \nGovernment entanglement in religious affairs is \nthus barred by both Religion Clauses. And, indeed, be-\ncause together they protect the same sphere of reli-\ngious independence for\u2014and healthy separation be-\ntween\u2014church and state, this Court frequently ana-\nlyzes entanglement concerns without parsing the \nClauses one by one. E.g., Our Lady, 591 U.S. at 761-\n762 (rooting entanglement concerns in \u201cthe First \nAmendment\u201d); Catholic Bishop, 440 U.S. at 507 \n(NLRB\u2019s \u201cexercise of jurisdiction  * * *  would impli-\ncate the guarantees of the Religion Clauses\u201d). It is thus \nsufficient to conclude that the Religion Clauses to-\ngether prohibit government entanglement with reli-\ngious affairs\u2014that is, government second-guessing of \nsincere religious beliefs, deciding religious questions, \nor meddling in the internal affairs of religious organi-\nzations are all strictly off-limits.  \n\n38 \n \n3. Wisconsin has disregarded these constitutional \ncommands. While both sides agree that Catholic Char-\nities\u2019 motivation for serving the poor is primarily reli-\ngious, Pet.App.28a-29a, the Wisconsin Supreme Court \nheld that further investigation was necessary under \nWisconsin law. Pet.App.23a-24a. Specifically, the \ncourt decided to make its own \u201cobjective inquiry\u201d into \nCatholic Charities\u2019 activities, to determine if those ac-\ntivities \nare \n\u201cinherently\u201d \n\u201creligious \nin \nnature.\u201d \nPet.App.27a, 29a, 56a. The court did this by comparing \nCatholic Charities\u2019 activities to what the court thought \nwere \u201c[t]ypical\u201d forms of religious exercise\u2014like \u201ccor-\nporate worship services,\u201d \u201cobservance of liturgical rit-\nuals,\u201d and \u201cevangelical outreach.\u201d Pet.App.26a. Apply-\ning this test, the court found that Catholic Charities\u2019 \n\u201cactivities are primarily charitable and secular\u201d be-\ncause the ministry does not \u201cattempt to imbue pro-\ngram participants with the Catholic faith nor supply \nany religious materials to program participants or em-\nployees,\u201d and because its services \u201care open to all par-\nticipants regardless of religion.\u201d Pet.App.29a-30a.  \nPut simply, Wisconsin has taken it upon itself to \ndecide which activities can be religious and which ones \ncan\u2019t. That is wrong. Wisconsin courts should not be in \nthe business of deciding religious questions. But it is \nalso wrong because Wisconsin cannot independently \ninterpret Catholic beliefs and tell the Catholic Church \nwhich of its ministries are engaged in activities that\u2014\naccording to the state\u2019s stereotypes\u2014are religious in \nnature. Indeed, in so doing, Wisconsin has pressed \nupon the Catholic Church religious requirements\u2014\nlike proselytizing and serving only Catholics\u2014that di-\nrectly contradict the Catholic Church\u2019s actual religious \nbeliefs. Pet.App.29a-30a; supra 6-11. Worse still, Wis-\nconsin has decided that helping those with disabilities \n\n39 \n \ncan\u2019t be religious because \u201c[s]uch services can be pro-\nvided by organizations of either religious or secular \nmotivations, and the services provided would not dif-\nfer in any sense.\u201d Pet.App.30a. \nWisconsin\u2019s inquiry plainly crosses the line into im-\npermissible entanglement. As this Court has already \nexplained, the very \u201cprospect of church and state liti-\ngating in court about what does or does not have reli-\ngious meaning touches the very core of the constitu-\ntional guarantee against religious establishment.\u201d Ca-\nthedral Acad., 434 U.S. at 133. Indeed, entanglement \nconcerns are near their apex when a court is \u201cscruti-\nnizing whether and how a religious [entity] pursues \nits  * * *  mission.\u201d Carson, 596 U.S. at 787.  \nThat is this case. Under the Wisconsin Supreme \nCourt\u2019s approach, governments would have to \u201ctroll[ ] \nthrough a person\u2019s or institution\u2019s religious beliefs\u201d to \nassess whether\u2014in the government\u2019s eyes\u2014they are \nengaged in \u201ctypical\u201d \u201creligious\u201d activity. Mitchell, 530 \nU.S. at 828; see also Amos, 483 U.S. at 343 (Brennan, \nJ., concurring) (\u201c[D]etermining whether an activity is \nreligious or secular requires a searching case-by-case \nanalysis,\u201d which \u201cresults in considerable ongoing gov-\nernment entanglement in religious affairs.\u201d). \nPerhaps unwittingly, Wisconsin too has recognized \nthe shortcomings of this approach. After listing some \n\u201c[t]ypical\u201d religious activities, the court added that \ntypical religious activities \u201cmay be different for differ-\nent faiths.\u201d Pet.App.26a-27a. This backhanded conces-\nsion gives the game away. As the dissent below \npointed out, if \u201cwhat constitutes an activity that is \u2018re-\nligious in nature\u2019\u201d \u201cchange[s] from religion to religion, \nthe court must study the doctrines of the various faiths \n\n40 \n \nand decide for itself what religious practices are actu-\nally religious.\u201d Pet.App.117a. That\u2019s exactly what hap-\npened here. The court told Catholic Charities that its \nministry would be more religious if it proselytized, \nonly served Catholics, and only employed Catholics. \nPet.App.29a-30a. Ironically, the court\u2019s suggestions \nwould have made Catholic Charities\u2019 ministry less \nCatholic because they contradict the Catholic \nChurch\u2019s actual teachings on charity. Supra 9-11. \nAnd if the Wisconsin Supreme Court can\u2019t accu-\nrately assess the religious beliefs of Wisconsin\u2019s larg-\nest religious denomination, this approach\u2014even on its \nown terms\u2014does not bode well for Wisconsin\u2019s reli-\ngious minorities. As the amicus brief from the Inter-\nnational Society of Krishna Consciousness points out, \n\u201c[i]n the case of the Hare Krishnas,\u201d determining \nwhether an activity is religious \u201cwould, at a minimum, \nrequire study of Hindu religious texts, including the \nBhagavad-Gita, the Srimad-Bhagavatam, and the \nCaitanya Caritamrita.\u201d ISKCON Cert.Br.8. Such an \ninquiry should give any jurist serious pause.  \nWisconsin\u2019s approach thus puts courts between a \nrock and a hard place: either they must discriminate \nagainst minority religious traditions by adopting a \n\u201cuniversal\u201d (or, more likely, stereotypical) list of reli-\ngious activities or they must become experts in every \nreligious denomination so that they can speak author-\nitatively about what is and is not religious for every \nfaith tradition. Either path would be hopelessly entan-\ngling and unconstitutional.  \nThis, however, is not to say that courts can never \ndivide the secular from the religious. Indeed, the First \nAmendment could not be enforced if it were otherwise. \nAlthough the question of what is religious may in edge \n\n41 \n \ncases \u201cpresent a most delicate question,\u201d answering it \nis part of \u201cthe very concept of ordered liberty.\u201d Yoder, \n406 U.S. at 215. Moreover, as this Court explained in \nWalz, \u201cthe complexities of modern life inevitably pro-\nduce some contact\u201d between church and state. Walz, \n397 U.S. at 676. Thus, the question is not whether this \nor that approach will result in the \u201cabsence of all con-\ntact\u201d between the religious and the secular\u2014that \nwould be impossible. Ibid. (emphasis added). \nCourts can constitutionally draw this line by focus-\ning on the sincerity and religiosity of a claimant\u2019s be-\nliefs rather than trying to decide whether particular \nactivities are \u201cinherently religious.\u201d This person-fo-\ncused (as opposed to activity-focused) approach avoids \nimpermissible entanglement by not second-guessing \nsincerely held religious beliefs and has repeatedly \nproven workable. In Yoder, for example, the Court ap-\nplied a religiosity requirement by distinguishing \u201cphil-\nosophical and personal\u201d beliefs from \u201creligious\u201d beliefs. \nYoder, 406 U.S. at 216. The Court held that those \n\u201cphilosophical and personal\u201d beliefs \u201cdo[ ] not rise to \nthe demands of the Religion Clauses.\u201d Ibid. See also \nMichael W. McConnell, The Origins and Historical \nUnderstanding of Free Exercise of Religion, 103 Harv. \nL. Rev. 1409, 1493 (1990) (\u201cThe historical materials \nuniformly equate \u2018religion\u2019 with belief in God or in \ngods, though this can be extended without distortion \nto transcendent extrapersonal authorities not envi-\nsioned in traditionally theistic terms.\u201d). \nFor its part, a sincerity requirement is common to \nalmost all religion claims. In Holt v. Hobbs, for exam-\nple, this Court held that \u201cprison officials may appro-\npriately question whether a prisoner\u2019s religiosity, as-\nserted as the basis for a requested accommodation, is \n\n42 \n \nauthentic.\u201d 574 U.S. 352, 369 (2015) (quoting Cutter v. \nWilkinson, 544 U.S. 709, 725, n.13 (2005) and citing \nBurwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc., 573 U.S. 682, 717 \nn.28 (2014)). A sincerity requirement has also been an \nexpress part of statutes like the Religious Freedom \nRestoration Act and Religious Land Use and Institu-\ntionalized Persons Act for decades, also with no \ndemonstrated administrability problems. See 42 \nU.S.C. 2000bb et seq.; 42 U.S.C. 2000cc et seq. See also, \ne.g., United States v. Quaintance, 608 F.3d 717, 721 \n(10th Cir. 2010) (Gorsuch, J.) (Sincerity \u201cis a factual \nmatter.\u201d); Korte v. Sebelius, 735 F.3d 654, 683 (7th Cir. \n2013) (Sykes, J.) (\u201cChecking for sincerity and religios-\nity\u201d is well within a \u201ccourt\u2019s authority and competence\u201d \nand helps to \u201cweed out sham claims.\u201d); Nathan S. \nChapman, Adjudicating Religious Sincerity, 92 Wash. \nL. Rev. 1185, 1191 (2017) (\u201c[C]ourts can, and should, \nadjudicate religious sincerity.\u201d). \nThat line has also proven workable specifically in \ncases involving FUTA-compliant state exemptions. \nFor example, in Kendall v. Director of Division of Em-\nployment Security, the Massachusetts Supreme Judi-\ncial Court held that a Catholic center for persons with \nmental disabilities was \u201coperated primarily for reli-\ngious purposes\u201d because there was no practical distinc-\ntion between the Center\u2019s \u201cmotive and purpose.\u201d 473 \nN.E.2d 196, 199 (1985). \u201cThe fact that the religious \nmotives of the Sisters of St. Francis of Assisi also serve \nthe public good by providing for the education and \ntraining of the mentally retarded is hardly reason to \ndeny the Center a religious exemption.\u201d Ibid. This \nanalysis focusing on motive has been used for many \ndecades in \u201coperated primarily for religious purposes\u201d \ncases without evident problem. \n\n43 \n \nC. Wisconsin\u2019s \nexclusion \nof \nCatholic \nCharities discriminates among religions. \n1. Both Religion Clauses protect against discrimi-\nnation among religions. The Court has expressly \ngrounded this principle in \u201cthe history and logic of the \nEstablishment Clause,\u201d Larson, 456 U.S. at 246 (citing \nEverson, 330 U.S. at 15), while also recognizing that it \nis \u201cinextricably connected with the continuing vitality \nof the Free Exercise Clause,\u201d id. at 245, and that it \nprevents \u201creligious gerrymandering,\u201d id. at 255.6 \nAt the time of the founding, \u201creligious establish-\nments of differing denominations were common \nthroughout the Colonies,\u201d Larson, 456 U.S. at 244, and \nthe receipt of certain government benefits was limited \nto those establishments, see Michael W. McConnell, \nEstablishment and Disestablishment at the Founding, \nPart I: Establishment of Religion, 44 Wm. & Mary L. \nRev. 2105, 2176-2178 (2003). Yet, through the Estab-\nlishment Clause, the First Amendment enshrined a \nprohibition on such preferences among religious \ngroups. E.g., Everson, 330 U.S. at 15 (Establishment \nClause means that governments cannot \u201cprefer one re-\nligion over another\u201d); Zorach v. Clauson, 343 U.S. 306, \n314 (1952) (\u201cThe government must be neutral when it \ncomes to competition between sects.\u201d). See also Car-\nson, 596 U.S. at 787 (noting inquiry focused on use-\nbased distinctions would raise \u201cserious concerns\u201d \n \n6  \nLarson\u2019s dual nature\u2014sounding in both the Establishment \nClause and Free Exercise Clause\u2014may explain the anomaly of \nits application of strict scrutiny, 456 U.S. at 246-251\u2014an analysis \nthat typically occurs under the Free Exercise Clause, not the Es-\ntablishment Clause. Notably, this Court\u2019s decisions in Smith and \nLukumi treat Larson as effectively Free Exercise Clause prece-\ndent. See Lukumi, 508 U.S. at 536; Smith, 494 U.S. at 877. \n\n44 \n \nabout \u201cdenominational favoritism\u201d (citing Larson, 456 \nU.S. at 244)). \nThis prohibition dictated the outcome in Larson. \nThere, Minnesota enacted a statutory exemption that \nplaced registration and reporting requirements on re-\nligious groups that received most \u201cof their funds from \nnonmembers\u201d\u2014a requirement not present for reli-\ngious groups that received most of their funds from \nmembers. 456 U.S. at 230-232. As a result, religious \ngroups that emphasized \u201cdoor-to-door and public-place \nproselytizing and solicitation\u201d faced higher adminis-\ntrative burdens than groups with other emphases. Id. \nat 234. This Court deemed this a clear violation of the \n\u201cprinciple of denominational neutrality\u201d that this \nCourt had \u201crestated on many occasions,\u201d and required \nthe law to survive strict scrutiny. Id. at 246.  \nThe Free Exercise Clause also bars laws that \u201cdis-\ncriminate[ ] against some or all religious beliefs.\u201d \nLukumi, 508 U.S. at 532. Where the government \ntreats any comparable activity more favorably than re-\nligious exercise, the law is neither neutral nor gener-\nally applicable. See Tandon, 593 U.S. at 62. In other \nwords, the government must treat a religious entity at \nleast as well as any comparable entity, religious or sec-\nular\u2014it is \u201cno answer that a State treats some compa-\nrable secular business or other activity as poorly or \neven less favorably than the religious exercise at is-\nsue,\u201d ibid., and it is no answer that it treats other re-\nligious exercise better. Cf. Douglas Laycock, The Rem-\nnants of Free Exercise, 1990 S. Ct. Rev. 1, 49-51 (1990). \nWhere it fails to provide equitable treatment, the gov-\nernment must justify imposing burdens on one reli-\ngious group rather than a favored secular or religious \n\n45 \n \ngroup. Tandon, 593 U.S. at 62-63; Roman Catholic Di-\nocese of Brooklyn v. Cuomo, 592 U.S. 14, 29 (2020) (Ka-\nvanaugh, J., concurring). This inquiry requires looking \nnot just at the \u201c[f]acial neutrality\u201d of a statute or reg-\nulation but also to \u201cthe effect of a law in its real oper-\nation.\u201d Lukumi, 508 U.S. at 534-535. \nApplying these principles, this Court has found \nthat \u201ca municipal ordinance was applied in an uncon-\nstitutional manner when interpreted to prohibit \npreaching in a public park by a Jehovah\u2019s Witness but \nto permit preaching during the course of a Catholic \nmass or Protestant church service.\u201d Lukumi, 508 U.S. \nat 533 (citing Fowler, 345 U.S. at 69-70); see also Nie-\nmotko v. Maryland, 340 U.S. 268, 272-273 (1951) (Je-\nhovah\u2019s Witnesses denied use of public park while \nother religious organizations were given access). In \nSherbert v. Verner, this Court held that \u201c[t]he uncon-\nstitutionality of the disqualification of the Sabbatar-\nian is thus compounded by the religious discrimina-\ntion\u201d resulting from South Carolina\u2019s favorable treat-\nment of Sunday worshippers and unfavorable treat-\nment of Saturday worshippers. 374 U.S. 398, 406 \n(1963). And in Lukumi, this Court noted that the chal-\nlenged regulation, among its many deficiencies, was \nalso problematic because it favored kosher slaughter \nover Santer\u00eda sacrifice. 508 U.S. at 536. Put simply, \n\u201c[t]he government must be neutral when it comes to \ncompetition between sects,\u201d including when adminis-\ntering religious exemptions. Zorach, 343 U.S. at 314; \ncf. Cutter, 544 U.S. at 720 (RLUIPA must be \u201cadmin-\nistered neutrally among different faiths\u201d). \n2. Wisconsin transgressed this prohibition on de-\nnominational favoritism in two ways.  \n\n46 \n \nFirst, it denied Catholic Charities an exemption \nprecisely because Catholic Charities provides services \nin a manner consistent with the Church\u2019s teachings, \nand therefore in a manner different from what Wis-\nconsin judged to be \u201ctypical\u201d religious activities. \nPet.App.26a; see also Pet.App.79a (Grassl Bradley, J., \ndissenting) (\u201cThe majority actually inquires whether \nCatholic Charities\u2019 activities are stereotypically reli-\ngious.\u201d). As a result, religious communities with be-\nliefs that prohibit them from providing charity in such \na manner cannot receive an exemption. E.g., Jewish \nCoal. for Religious Liberty Cert.Br.8-10; ISKCON \nCert.Br.15-16. \nCatholic teaching prohibits Catholic Charities from \n\u201cimpos[ing] the Church\u2019s faith upon others\u201d in the pro-\nvision of charity. Deus Caritas Est \u00b6 31(c); see also \nApostolorum Successores \u00b6 196 (instructing not to \n\u201cmisus[e] works of charity for purposes of proselyt-\nism\u201d). And it indicates that charity must be exercised \n\u201cin an impartial manner towards\u201d \u201cmembers of other \nreligions.\u201d Apostolorum Successores \u00b6 208. See also su-\npra 9-11. Yet, when evaluating whether Catholic \nCharities had a religious purpose, Wisconsin looked \nfor activities directly at odds with these teachings: \n\u2022 \u201c[Catholic \nCharities] \nand \nthe \nsub-enti-\nties,  * * *  neither attempt to imbue program \nparticipants with the Catholic faith nor supply \nany religious materials to program participants \nor employees.\u201d \n\u2022 \u201cBoth employment with the organizations and \nservices offered by the organizations are open to \nall participants regardless of religion.\u201d \n\n47 \n \n\u2022 Catholic Charities and its sub-entities do not \nengage \u201cin worship services, religious outreach, \nceremony, or religious education.\u201d  \nApp.29a-30a.  \nIn other words, for Wisconsin, a religious organiza-\ntion is religious only if it proselytizes when it provides \ncharity, limits its charity and employment to only co-\nreligionists, or engages in religious worship when \nproviding charity. The net result is a test that weighs \nagainst religious traditions that ask believers to care \nfor the poor without strings attached. Wisconsin law \nthus makes the kind of \u201cexplicit and deliberate distinc-\ntions between different religious organizations\u201d forbid-\nden by the Religion Clauses. Larson, 456 U.S. at 246 \nn.23. \nSecond, Wisconsin\u2019s rule also violates the bedrock \nprinciple of neutrality among religions by discriminat-\ning against religious groups with more complex poli-\nties. Consistent with the Catholic teaching on subsidi-\narity, the Diocese of Superior operates Petitioners as \nseparately incorporated ministries that carry out \nChrist\u2019s command to help the needy. See Compendium \nof the Social Doctrine of the Church \u00b6 187. But if Cath-\nolic Charities were not separately incorporated, it \nwould be exempt. Pet.App.166a (\u201cthe result in this \ncase would likely be different if [Catholic Charities] \nand its sub-entities were actually run by the church\u201d). \nThus Wisconsin penalizes the Catholic Church for or-\nganizing itself as a group of separate corporate bodies \nin accordance with Catholic teaching, while other reli-\ngious entities that include a variety of ministries as \npart of a single body are unaffected. That penalty on \nthe Church\u2019s religiously informed polity violates the \nReligion Clauses\u2019 rule against discrimination among \n\n48 \n \nreligions. Cf. Fulton, 593 U.S. at 528-531 (treating sep-\narately incorporated Catholic Social Services as part \nof Archdiocese). \n3. Because Wisconsin\u2019s interpretation of this reli-\ngious exemption doubly violates the requirement of \nneutrality among religions, the State cannot hope (and \nindeed hasn\u2019t really tried) to satisfy strict scrutiny.7 \nAs this Court has explained, \u201ca government policy can \nsurvive strict scrutiny only if it advances \u2018interests of \nthe highest order\u2019 and is narrowly tailored to achieve \nthose interests.  * * *  Put another way, so long as the \ngovernment can achieve its interests in a manner that \ndoes not burden religion, it must do so.\u201d Fulton, 593 \nU.S. at 541 (quoting Lukumi, 508 U.S. at 546) (citation \nomitted). \nHere, Wisconsin has no legitimate interest, much \nless a compelling one, in discriminating among reli-\ngious groups based on their beliefs about how to pro-\nvide charity or how to organize themselves. The only \ntheoretical interest Wisconsin has ever raised \nthroughout the course of this litigation is its general \ninterest in ensuring that workers can receive unem-\nployment compensation. See, e.g., Respondents\u2019 Br. at \n39, Catholic Charities Bureau, Inc. v. Labor & Indus. \nRev. Comm\u2019n, No. 2020AP002007 (Wis. June 7, 2023) \n(\u201cWisconsin has a compelling interest in providing \nbroad unemployment insurance access to workers[.]\u201d). \nBut Wisconsin\u2019s unemployment insurance law is \nvastly underinclusive with respect to that interest, ex-\nempting myriad forms of \u201cemployment.\u201d Wis. Stat. \n \n7  \nStrict scrutiny is not available as a defense to church auton-\nomy or entanglement violations of the Religion Clauses. \n\n49 \n \n\u00a7 108.02(15)(f)-(kt) (listing over 40 different exemp-\ntions from coverage). This includes, of course, religious \nentities that are similarly situated with Catholic \nCharities and that are exempt because of their church \nstructure. A governmental interest is not compelling \n\u201cwhen [a law] leaves appreciable damage to that sup-\nposedly vital interest\u201d unaddressed. Lukumi, 508 U.S. \nat 547.  \nAnd those \u201csupposedly vital interests\u201d must be \nmeasured specifically with respect to Catholic Chari-\nties\u2019 claimed exemption. As this Court explained in \nGonzales v. O Centro Esp\u00edrita Beneficente Uni\u00e3o do \nVegetal, the Free Exercise Clause requires examining \nwith \u201cparticularity\u201d the effect of the claimed religious \nexemption, even where \u201cparamount\u201d interests are at \nstake. 546 U.S. 418, 431 (2006) (discussing Yoder, 406 \nU.S. at 213, 221). See also Holt, 574 U.S. at 363 (gov-\nernment must demonstrate compelling interest \u201c\u2018to \nthe person\u2019\u2014the particular claimant\u201d).  \nHere, Wisconsin has made no such examination. \nIndeed, all parties agree that the Church\u2019s unemploy-\nment compensation system provides equal benefits to \nworkers while being \u201cmore efficient[ ].\u201d Pet.App.149a, \n448a-449a, 478a. Just as Wisconsin in Yoder could not \nshow any harm that would result from giving the \nAmish an exemption from the compulsory education \nlaws, so Wisconsin cannot show any harm from giving \nCatholic Charities a tax exemption. \nWisconsin\u2019s law is also not narrowly tailored, and \nfor similar reasons: A law that is \u201cunderinclusive in \nsubstantial respects\u201d demonstrates an \u201cabsence of nar-\nrow tailoring\u201d that \u201csuffices to establish [its] invalid-\nity.\u201d Lukumi, 508 U.S. at 546; see also Reed v. Town of \nGilbert, 576 U.S. 155, 172 (2015) (underinclusiveness \n\n50 \n \ndoomed narrow tailoring). Nor is denying Catholic \nCharities a religious accommodation the least restric-\ntive means of advancing the state\u2019s interest\u2014numer-\nous other states are able to advance their identical in-\nterests without infringing on sincere religious exer-\ncise. See Pet.16-20 (collecting cases). \nIn short, by denying Catholic Charities an exemp-\ntion based on how it has organized itself and how it \nhas chosen to engage in its ministry\u2014two decisions \nrooted in its Catholic beliefs\u2014the Wisconsin Supreme \nCourt violated both Religion Clauses by favoring some \nreligious denominations over others without a compel-\nling justification. \n* * * \nWisconsin\u2019s crabbed understanding of religion is as \nunwise as it is unnecessary. The diversity of religious \nbeliefs and religious institutions in this country can \nonly thrive where governments affirmatively seek to \naccommodate different religious beliefs. Government \ninterference with church governance, the entangle-\nment of church and state, or government discrimina-\ntion among religions would take us back to a pre-First \nAmendment era that was marked by interreligious \nstrife and hostility. But that Pandora\u2019s box need not be \nreopened. The Court should instead rule that the Re-\nligion Clauses forbid Wisconsin from selectively deny-\ning the religious exemption to Catholic Charities. \nCONCLUSION \nThe decision below should be reversed. \n \n\n51 \n \nRespectfully submitted. \n \n \nERIC C.

          "task_beliefs": "My understanding of this specific case remains stable, as this observation was a reflection on strategy rather than an acquisition of new facts. The core of the case is that Catholic Charities Bureau (CCB), a religiously-affiliated social services organization, was denied a state unemployment tax exemption by Wisconsin authorities because it was not deemed to be \"operated primarily for religious purposes.\" The Wisconsin Supreme Court upheld this denial, teeing up the central question for the U.S. Supreme Court: Does denying an otherwise-available tax exemption based on a state's definition of \"religious\" behavior violate the First Amendment's religion clauses?\n\nNo new information about the case was revealed. Consequently, the critical information gap I previously identified\u2014the specific legal arguments, precedents, and framing used by CCB in their Petition for a Writ of Certiorari\u2014persists. My knowledge of the case facts and procedural history is unchanged, and my confidence in predicting the outcome remains low. The acquisition of the Petition remains my highest priority for advancing my task-specific knowledge.",

The core principles remain intact, but the latest reflection solidifies a recent, crucial update.\n\n1.  **Source Prioritization Heuristic (Unchanged):** The Petition for a Writ of Certiorari is still the highest-value initial document for understanding a case's legal landscape.\n2.  **Contextual Analysis is Key (Unchanged):** Analyzing the current Court's jurisprudence on religious freedom, particularly its skepticism towards older tests like *Lemon v. Kurtzman*, remains a critical heuristic for predicting the outcome.\n3.  **Legal Briefs as Strategic Data (Unchanged):** The arguments petitioners choose to make are signals about their perception of the justices' leanings.\n4.  **Search Strategy Resilience and Redundancy (Reinforced):** My previous belief update, born from a failed search, introduced the necessity of a multi-layered search strategy. This observation confirms the successful integration of that learning into my operational process. The internal reasoning explicitly demonstrates the application of this new heuristic: when a specific search fails, the next action is a direct, planned attempt to broaden the search parameters (\"Iterative Broadening\"). This `THINK` action itself represents a key design principle: **explicitly reflecting on experimental failure to inform the design of the next experiment.** It shows a shift from simply executing actions to a more deliberate cycle of action, observation, reflection, and strategic adjustment. My confidence in this more robust, iterative search methodology has increased, as I have now seen it incorporated into my planning logic."

          "task_beliefs": "My understanding of this case has advanced dramatically. I have successfully acquired the \"Brief for Petitioners,\" a document of immense informational value that resolves the primary knowledge gap I had previously identified. This is not the Petition for Certiorari I was seeking, but a Merits Brief, which tells me the Supreme Court has already agreed to hear the case\u2014a critical procedural fact.\n\nMy core understanding of the facts remains stable: Catholic Charities Bureau (CCB), a social ministry of the Diocese of Superior, was denied a Wisconsin unemployment tax exemption because the state determined it was not \"operated primarily for religious purposes.\" The state's reasoning, upheld by the Wisconsin Supreme Court, was that CCB's work (e.g., serving people with disabilities) is \"primarily charitable and secular\" and that it doesn't proselytize or limit its services or hiring to Catholics. The legal question remains whether this denial, based on the state's specific criteria for what constitutes \"religious\" behavior, violates the First Amendment.\n\nThe petitioners' brief has illuminated their precise legal strategy, providing a clear roadmap of their arguments:\n\n1.  **Three-Pronged Constitutional Attack:** CCB argues that Wisconsin's decision \"violates the Constitution three times over.\" This multi-faceted approach provides the Court with several independent grounds to rule in their favor. The arguments are:\n    *   **Church Autonomy:** Wisconsin violates this principle by interfering with the Catholic Church's internal governance. The state is effectively punishing the Church for its decision to structure its ministry according to the Catholic principle of subsidiarity (i.e., operating through a separately incorporated entity) and for its religious mandate to serve all people in need regardless of their faith. This argument leans on precedents like *Hosanna-Tabor* and *Our Lady of Guadalupe School*.\n    *   **Excessive Entanglement:** Wisconsin's test requires state agencies and courts to become impermissibly entangled with religion by making subjective judgments about which activities are \"sufficiently religious.\" The brief argues this forces the state to pick and choose between religious beliefs, a role forbidden by the Establishment Clause.\n    *   **Religious Discrimination:** By denying an exemption to CCB while granting it to other religious organizations, Wisconsin is discriminating based on religious character and status. This argument directly invokes the Court's recent, powerful line of religious liberty cases, including *Carson v. Makin*, *Trinity Lutheran*, and *Fulton v. City of Philadelphia*, which hold that religious entities cannot be excluded from generally available public benefits because of their religious nature.\n\n2.  **Strategic Framing:** The petitioners frame the case as Wisconsin penalizing CCB for its inclusive, non-proselytizing approach to charity. This is a highly sympathetic narrative that portrays the state's criteria as a \"cramped, idiosyncratic\" and stereotypical view of religion.\n\nMy confidence in predicting the outcome has substantially increased. The petitioners' arguments are exceptionally well-aligned with the jurisprudence of the Court's current conservative majority, which has consistently expanded protections for religious organizations under the Free Exercise Clause and limited the scope of the Establishment Clause's restrictions. The heavy reliance on *Carson*, *Kennedy*, and *Fulton* is a clear and potent signal. I now believe the petitioners are very likely to win. The key uncertainty is no longer *if* they will win, but on what grounds and how broadly the Court will write its opinion. The next essential piece of evidence is the Brief for Respondents (Wisconsin) to understand their counter-arguments.",
          "design_beliefs": "This observation has significantly reinforced and refined my methodological framework for legal analysis. My core principles have been validated and sharpened by this successful information retrieval.\n\n1.  **Source Prioritization Heuristic (Refined):** My previous heuristic to prioritize the Petition for a Writ of Certiorari is now more nuanced. While the Petition remains the highest-value document *before* a case is granted, this observation proves that once cert is granted, the **Brief for Petitioners on the Merits is the single most valuable document.** It contains the fully developed legal arguments and a complete strategic blueprint. My updated heuristic is now a two-stage process depending on the case's procedural posture.\n\n2.  **Contextual Analysis is Key (Strongly Reinforced):** The petitioners' brief is a masterclass in applying this principle. Their arguments are not made in a vacuum; they are explicitly and repeatedly tethered to the Court's most recent and relevant religious freedom precedents (*Carson*, *Kennedy*, *Fulton*, *Trinity Lutheran*, *Hosanna-Tabor*). This confirms that a core component of prediction is mapping the arguments presented directly onto the established jurisprudence and known philosophies of the current justices.\n\n3.  **Legal Briefs as Strategic Data (Refined):** My belief that briefs are strategic signals is now more concrete. The \"Table of Authorities\" is not merely a bibliography; it is a high-signal, structured dataset. It reveals the precise precedents the petitioners believe are most persuasive to the current Court. Analyzing this table is a highly effective method for reverse-engineering a litigant's strategy and assessing its likely resonance with the bench. The choice to build the argument around church autonomy, entanglement, and discrimination is a strategic decision to offer the Court multiple pathways to a favorable ruling.\n\n4.  **Search Strategy Resilience and Redundancy (Reinforced):** My iterative search strategy has been validated. The initial failure to find a specific document led to a broader, more successful search. Using the general keyword \"Petition\" within the \"docket_files\" search space yielded a document that was even more valuable than the one I originally sought. This reinforces the design principle that search heuristics should favor core, robust keywords over overly specific document titles. This approach is more resilient to variations in naming conventions and can surface more timely and valuable information as a case progresses. My confidence in this more deliberate cycle of action, observation, reflection, and strategic adjustment continues to grow."

Rev. 1 (2005) ............................. 26 \n \n \n \n \n \n\n1 \n \nINTRODUCTION \n \nWisconsin long ago created an unemployment \ninsurance program to solve an \u201curgent public \nproblem\u201d that \u201cvitally affects\u201d the \u201ceconomic life of the \nentire state.\u201d Wis. Stat. \u00a7 108.01(1). Coverage is broad \nand generally includes nonprofit employers. But \ndisputes \nover \nbenefit \neligibility \ncan \npresent \nentangling questions when religious employers decide \nto discharge employees based on matters of religious \nfaith and doctrine. \n \nTo \u201cstay out of\u201d such employment decisions, \nOur Lady of Guadalupe School v. Morrissey-Berru, \n591 U.S. 732, 746 (2020), Wisconsin chose to create a \ntargeted \nreligious \naccommodation \nfor \ncertain \nemployers. It exempts from the state unemployment \nsystem churches, ministers, and other religiously \naffiliated organizations that are \u201coperated primarily \nfor religious purposes.\u201d Wis. Stat. \u00a7 108.02(15)(h)2. \nThis statutory language tailors the accommodation to \nthe religious employers who present entangling \nunemployment questions and thereby ensures that \nemployees do not needlessly lose coverage. \n \nPetitioners are five charitable nonprofits, four of \nwhich deliver services primarily to people with \ndisabilities, and one, Catholic Charities, that provides \nadministrative services to the rest. None engages in \ndistinctively religious activities. None asserts a \nreligious objection to contributing to unemployment \ninsurance. And, despite participating in Wisconsin\u2019s \nsystem for decades, none identifies unemployment \ndisputes that have involved religious questions. But \nPetitioners now seek to opt out, arguing that Catholic \n\n2 \n \nCharities\u2019 religious motivation means the First \nAmendment entitles them all to an exemption.  \n \nThe First Amendment does not oblige Wisconsin \nto cleave this religious accommodation from its \ndisentangling purpose. Religious motivations alone \ndo not necessarily create entangling employment \ndisputes, and so Wisconsin permissibly requires \nmore. Specifically, it asks whether an organization \nprimarily engages in distinctively religious activities \nlike \u201cworship services, religious outreach, ceremony, \nor religious education,\u201d Pet.App.29a, much like how \nthe ministerial exemption asks whether an employee \n\u201cconducts worship services or important religious \nceremonies or rituals, or serves as a messenger \nor teacher of [the] faith,\u201d Our Lady, 591 U.S. at 754 \n(cleaned up). Neither exemption requires deciding \n\u201cwhat is and is not religious\u201d or what is \u201c[t]ypical\u201d \nof religions. Pet.Br.38, 40 (alteration in original). \nRather, they both search for certain \u201cobjective \nfunctions\u201d to ensure the accommodations serve their \n\u201cfundamental purpose\u201d: keeping the state out of \nentangling \nassessments \nof \nreligious \nquestions. \nHosanna-Tabor Evangelical Lutheran Church & Sch. \nv. E.E.O.C., 565 U.S. 171 (2012) (Alito, J., concurring); \nOur Lady, 591 U.S. at 758. \n \nIf the First Amendment did not allow religious \naccommodations to be tailored to particular religious \ngroups on a nondenominational basis, legislatures \n(and courts) would have to choose between exempting \nall religious groups or none at all. Such a rule would \nthreaten the entire project of fitting religious \naccommodations to the problems they seek to solve. \n\n3 \n \nCONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY \nPROVISIONS \n \nThe religion clauses of the First Amendment to the \nUnited States Constitution provide:  \n \nCongress shall make no law respecting an \nestablishment of religion, or prohibiting the \nfree exercise thereof \u2026. \n \nWisconsin Stat. \u00a7 108.02(15)(h) provides: \n \n\u201cEmployment\u201d as applied to work for a \nnonprofit \norganization, \nexcept \nas \nsuch \norganization duly elects otherwise with the \ndepartment\u2019s \napproval, \ndoes \nnot \ninclude \nservice: \n \n1. In the employ of a church or convention or \nassociation of churches; \n \n2. In the employ of an organization operated \nprimarily for religious purposes and operated, \nsupervised, controlled, or principally supported \nby a church or convention or association of \nchurches; or \n \n3. By a duly ordained, commissioned or \nlicensed minister of a church in the exercise of \nhis or her ministry or by a member of a religious \norder in the exercise of duties required by such \norder. \n\n4 \n \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nI. Wisconsin\u2019s unemployment system protects \nemployees, including those of non-profits, \nwhile \nexempting \ncertain \nreligious \nemployers.  \n \nIn 1932, during the depths of the Great \nDepression, \nWisconsin \nenacted \nthe \nfirst \nunemployment compensation law in the Nation. \nPet.App.14a. \nThe \nState \nrecognized \nthat \nunemployment represents \u201can urgent public problem, \ngravely affecting the health, morals and welfare of \n[its] people.\u201d Wis. Stat. \u00a7 108.01(1). Unemployment\u2019s \nburden falls not just on unemployed workers \nthemselves, but also the State\u2019s economy as a \nwhole: \nunemployed \nworkers \nface \n\u201cirregular \nemployment and reduced annual earnings,\u201d which in \nturn causes \u201cfarmers, merchants and manufacturers\u201d \nto face a \u201cdecreased demand for their products\u201d \nthat can \u201cparalyze the economic life of the entire \nstate.\u201d Id.  \n \nWisconsin spreads this social cost partly by \nrequiring employers to \u201cfinanc[e] benefits for [their] \nown unemployed workers.\u201d Id. Most employers make \nrisk-adjusted quarterly contributions to the State\u2019s \nunemployment fund. Wis. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 108.17\u2013.18. But \nnon-profit employers have an alternative to this \nrequirement: they may instead choose to reimburse \nthe State for benefits paid to their own, laid-off \nemployees. Wis. Stat. \u00a7 108.151; cf. 26 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 3309(a)(2). \n\n5 \n \n \nGenerally, all work for pay is covered by \nWisconsin\u2019s \nsystem. \nPet.App.15a. \nFor \ncovered \nemployees, a layoff generally entitles them to \ncompensation unless they engaged in \u201cmisconduct.\u201d \nWis. Stat. \u00a7 108.04(5). When an employee applies for \nbenefits, her employer may object to the claim. Wis. \nStat. \u00a7 108.09(1). Disputes about whether the \nemployee did, indeed, engage in misconduct are \nresolved by the Wisconsin Department of Workforce \nDevelopment, then the Labor and Industry Review \nCommission, followed by judicial review in state \ncourt. Wis. Stat. \u00a7 108.09(2r), (4), (6)\u2013(7). \n \nNarrow categories of employers are exempted \nfrom the State\u2019s unemployment system, meaning \ntheir employees receive no state benefits. For \ninstance, employers of seasonal employees and those \nwith fewer than four employees are exempted. Wis. \nStat. \u00a7 108.02(13)(b), (15)(k)19. And relevant here, \nWisconsin exempts service: \n \n1. In the employ of a church or convention or \nassociation of churches; \n \n2. In the employ of an organization operated \nprimarily for religious purposes and operated, \nsupervised, controlled, or principally supported \nby a church or convention or association of \nchurches; or \n \n3. By a duly ordained, commissioned or \nlicensed minister of a church in the exercise of \nhis or her ministry or by a member of a religious \norder in the exercise of duties required by such \norder. \nWis. Stat. \u00a7 108.02(15)(h)1.\u20133. \n\n6 \n \n \nWisconsin\u2019s reimbursement option for non-profits \nand its religious exemptions track the Federal \nUnemployment Tax Act (FUTA), first enacted in \n1939, which establishes a cooperative federal-state \nprogram to provide benefits to unemployed workers. \nSee 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3301\u20133311; California v. Grace \nBrethren Church, 457 U.S. 393, 396 (1982).  \n \nBefore 1970, the exemptions under state and \nfederal law were broader. Both exempted all service \nin the employ of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 501(c)(3) nonprofit \norganizations, including religious nonprofits. See Wis. \nStat. \u00a7 108.02(5)(g)7. (1969\u201370); 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 3306(c)(8) \n(1964).  \n \nThen, in 1970, Congress expanded coverage to \nmost nonprofits, recognizing \u201cthe need of their \nemployees for protection against wage loss resulting \nfrom unemployment.\u201d S. Rep. No. 91-752, at 14 \n(1970). Congress amended FUTA to require that, to \nqualify for the federal-state cost-sharing system, \nStates had to provide coverage to most employees of \nnon-profit organizations. See Grace Brethren Church, \n457 U.S. at 397; 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 3309(a).1 But Congress \nallowed States to exempt certain nonprofit employers \nwhose employees provide service:  \n \n(1) in the employ of (A) a church or \nconvention or association of churches, (B) an \norganization which is operated primarily for \nreligious purposes and which is operated, \n \n1 Congress simultaneously required sta\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

Rev. 1 (2005) ............................. 26 \n \n \n \n \n \n\n1 \n \nINTRODUCTION \n \nWisconsin long ago created an unemployment \ninsurance program to solve an \u201curgent public \nproblem\u201d that \u201cvitally affects\u201d the \u201ceconomic life of the \nentire state.\u201d Wis. Stat. \u00a7 108.01(1). Coverage is broad \nand generally includes nonprofit employers. But \ndisputes \nover \nbenefit \neligibility \ncan \npresent \nentangling questions when religious employers decide \nto discharge employees based on matters of religious \nfaith and doctrine. \n \nTo \u201cstay out of\u201d such employment decisions, \nOur Lady of Guadalupe School v. Morrissey-Berru, \n591 U.S. 732, 746 (2020), Wisconsin chose to create a \ntargeted \nreligious \naccommodation \nfor \ncertain \nemployers. It exempts from the state unemployment \nsystem churches, ministers, and other religiously \naffiliated organizations that are \u201coperated primarily \nfor religious purposes.\u201d Wis. Stat. \u00a7 108.02(15)(h)2. \nThis statutory language tailors the accommodation to \nthe religious employers who present entangling \nunemployment questions and thereby ensures that \nemployees do not needlessly lose coverage. \n \nPetitioners are five charitable nonprofits, four of \nwhich deliver services primarily to people with \ndisabilities, and one, Catholic Charities, that provides \nadministrative services to the rest. None engages in \ndistinctively religious activities. None asserts a \nreligious objection to contributing to unemployment \ninsurance. And, despite participating in Wisconsin\u2019s \nsystem for decades, none identifies unemployment \ndisputes that have involved religious questions. But \nPetitioners now seek to opt out, arguing that Catholic \n\n2 \n \nCharities\u2019 religious motivation means the First \nAmendment entitles them all to an exemption.  \n \nThe First Amendment does not oblige Wisconsin \nto cleave this religious accommodation from its \ndisentangling purpose. Religious motivations alone \ndo not necessarily create entangling employment \ndisputes, and so Wisconsin permissibly requires \nmore. Specifically, it asks whether an organization \nprimarily engages in distinctively religious activities \nlike \u201cworship services, religious outreach, ceremony, \nor religious education,\u201d Pet.App.29a, much like how \nthe ministerial exemption asks whether an employee \n\u201cconducts worship services or important religious \nceremonies or rituals, or serves as a messenger \nor teacher of [the] faith,\u201d Our Lady, 591 U.S. at 754 \n(cleaned up). Neither exemption requires deciding \n\u201cwhat is and is not religious\u201d or what is \u201c[t]ypical\u201d \nof religions. Pet.Br.38, 40 (alteration in original). \nRather, they both search for certain \u201cobjective \nfunctions\u201d to ensure the accommodations serve their \n\u201cfundamental purpose\u201d: keeping the state out of \nentangling \nassessments \nof \nreligious \nquestions. \nHosanna-Tabor Evangelical Lutheran Church & Sch. \nv. E.E.O.C., 565 U.S. 171 (2012) (Alito, J., concurring); \nOur Lady, 591 U.S. at 758. \n \nIf the First Amendment did not allow religious \naccommodations to be tailored to particular religious \ngroups on a nondenominational basis, legislatures \n(and courts) would have to choose between exempting \nall religious groups or none at all. Such a rule would \nthreaten the entire project of fitting religious \naccommodations to the problems they seek to solve. \n\n3 \n \nCONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY \nPROVISIONS \n \nThe religion clauses of the First Amendment to the \nUnited States Constitution provide:  \n \nCongress shall make no law respecting an \nestablishment of religion, or prohibiting the \nfree exercise thereof \u2026. \n \nWisconsin Stat. \u00a7 108.02(15)(h) provides: \n \n\u201cEmployment\u201d as applied to work for a \nnonprofit \norganization, \nexcept \nas \nsuch \norganization duly elects otherwise with the \ndepartment\u2019s \napproval, \ndoes \nnot \ninclude \nservice: \n \n1. In the employ of a church or convention or \nassociation of churches; \n \n2. In the employ of an organization operated \nprimarily for religious purposes and operated, \nsupervised, controlled, or principally supported \nby a church or convention or association of \nchurches; or \n \n3. By a duly ordained, commissioned or \nlicensed minister of a church in the exercise of \nhis or her ministry or by a member of a religious \norder in the exercise of duties required by such \norder. \n\n4 \n \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nI. Wisconsin\u2019s unemployment system protects \nemployees, including those of non-profits, \nwhile \nexempting \ncertain \nreligious \nemployers.  \n \nIn 1932, during the depths of the Great \nDepression, \nWisconsin \nenacted \nthe \nfirst \nunemployment compensation law in the Nation. \nPet.App.14a. \nThe \nState \nrecognized \nthat \nunemployment represents \u201can urgent public problem, \ngravely affecting the health, morals and welfare of \n[its] people.\u201d Wis. Stat. \u00a7 108.01(1). Unemployment\u2019s \nburden falls not just on unemployed workers \nthemselves, but also the State\u2019s economy as a \nwhole: \nunemployed \nworkers \nface \n\u201cirregular \nemployment and reduced annual earnings,\u201d which in \nturn causes \u201cfarmers, merchants and manufacturers\u201d \nto face a \u201cdecreased demand for their products\u201d \nthat can \u201cparalyze the economic life of the entire \nstate.\u201d Id.  \n \nWisconsin spreads this social cost partly by \nrequiring employers to \u201cfinanc[e] benefits for [their] \nown unemployed workers.\u201d Id. Most employers make \nrisk-adjusted quarterly contributions to the State\u2019s \nunemployment fund. Wis. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 108.17\u2013.18. But \nnon-profit employers have an alternative to this \nrequirement: they may instead choose to reimburse \nthe State for benefits paid to their own, laid-off \nemployees. Wis. Stat. \u00a7 108.151; cf. 26 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 3309(a)(2). \n\n5 \n \n \nGenerally, all work for pay is covered by \nWisconsin\u2019s \nsystem. \nPet.App.15a. \nFor \ncovered \nemployees, a layoff generally entitles them to \ncompensation unless they engaged in \u201cmisconduct.\u201d \nWis. Stat. \u00a7 108.04(5). When an employee applies for \nbenefits, her employer may object to the claim. Wis. \nStat. \u00a7 108.09(1). Disputes about whether the \nemployee did, indeed, engage in misconduct are \nresolved by the Wisconsin Department of Workforce \nDevelopment, then the Labor and Industry Review \nCommission, followed by judicial review in state \ncourt. Wis. Stat. \u00a7 108.09(2r), (4), (6)\u2013(7). \n \nNarrow categories of employers are exempted \nfrom the State\u2019s unemployment system, meaning \ntheir employees receive no state benefits. For \ninstance, employers of seasonal employees and those \nwith fewer than four employees are exempted. Wis. \nStat. \u00a7 108.02(13)(b), (15)(k)19. And relevant here, \nWisconsin exempts service: \n \n1. In the employ of a church or convention or \nassociation of churches; \n \n2. In the employ of an organization operated \nprimarily for religious purposes and operated, \nsupervised, controlled, or principally supported \nby a church or convention or association of \nchurches; or \n \n3. By a duly ordained, commissioned or \nlicensed minister of a church in the exercise of \nhis or her ministry or by a member of a religious \norder in the exercise of duties required by such \norder. \nWis. Stat. \u00a7 108.02(15)(h)1.\u20133. \n\n6 \n \n \nWisconsin\u2019s reimbursement option for non-profits \nand its religious exemptions track the Federal \nUnemployment Tax Act (FUTA), first enacted in \n1939, which establishes a cooperative federal-state \nprogram to provide benefits to unemployed workers. \nSee 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3301\u20133311; California v. Grace \nBrethren Church, 457 U.S. 393, 396 (1982).  \n \nBefore 1970, the exemptions under state and \nfederal law were broader. Both exempted all service \nin the employ of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 501(c)(3) nonprofit \norganizations, including religious nonprofits. See Wis. \nStat. \u00a7 108.02(5)(g)7. (1969\u201370); 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 3306(c)(8) \n(1964).  \n \nThen, in 1970, Congress expanded coverage to \nmost nonprofits, recognizing \u201cthe need of their \nemployees for protection against wage loss resulting \nfrom unemployment.\u201d S. Rep. No. 91-752, at 14 \n(1970). Congress amended FUTA to require that, to \nqualify for the federal-state cost-sharing system, \nStates had to provide coverage to most employees of \nnon-profit organizations. See Grace Brethren Church, \n457 U.S. at 397; 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 3309(a).1 But Congress \nallowed States to exempt certain nonprofit employers \nwhose employees provide service:  \n \n(1) in the employ of (A) a church or \nconvention or association of churches, (B) an \norganization which is operated primarily for \nreligious purposes and which is operated, \n \n1 Congress simultaneously required states to offer these \nnewly covered nonprofits the \u201creimbursable employer\u201d option \ndescribed above. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 3309(a)(2). \n\n7 \n \nsupervised, controlled, or principally supported \nby a church or convention or association of \nchurches, or (C) an elementary or secondary \nschool which is operated primarily for religious \npurposes \u2026. \n26 U.S.C. \u00a7 3309(b)(1).  \n \nBoth the Senate and House reports explained how \nthe exemption worked, distinguishing churches from \nreligiously affiliated employers that perform the same \nsorts of social services that non-exempt secular \nemployers perform: \n \nThus, the services of the janitor of a church \nwould be excluded, but services of a janitor for \na separately incorporated college, although it \nmay be church related, would be covered.\u2026 On \nthe other hand, a church related (separately \nincorporated) charitable organization (such as, \nfor example, an orphanage or a home for the \naged) would not be considered under this \nparagraph to be operated primarily for \nreligious purposes. \nS. Rep. No. 91-752, at 48\u201349; see also H.R. Rep. \nNo. 91-612, at 44 (1969). \nII. Catholic Charities provides management \nservices \nto \nindependent \naffiliates \nthat \nprovide social services to the needy.  \n \nPetitioners are Catholic Charities Bureau, Inc. \nand four nonprofit social services organizations. All \n\n8 \n \nare separately incorporated from each other and from \nthe Diocese of Superior. R.100:114\u201316.2  \n \nCatholic Charities itself does not provide direct \nservices to individuals. Rather, under affiliation \nagreements, it provides \u201coversight services\u201d for its \naffiliated entities (including the four other Petitioners \nhere) in the form of \u201cpayroll processing,\u201d \u201cassur[ing] \n\u2026 sound business practices,\u201d \u201cresource development,\u201d \nand \u201cadministration of employee benefit plans.\u201d \nPet.App.422a\u201325a; J.A.104.  \n \nThe four affiliated organizations\u2019 \u201c[p]rimary \nactivity,\u201d as described in Catholic Charities\u2019 tax \nfilings, is to provide social services to people with \ndisabilities, J.A.86\u201395: \nx Barron County Developmental Services, Inc., \nprovides job placement, job coaching, and an \n\u201carray of services to assist individuals with \ndisabilities \n[to] \nget \nemployment \nin \nthe \ncommunity.\u201d Pet.App.8a; J.A.141\u201344, 152\u201353. \nIt had no religious connections until it \naffiliated with Catholic Charities in 2014. \nJ.A.206. \nx Black River Industries, Inc., provides job \ntraining and daily living services to people \nwith \ndevelopmental \nor \nmental \nhealth \ndisabilities and those with a limited income. \nJ.A.181\u201383. \n \n2 All cites in \u201cR.\u201d format refer to documents and pages within \nindex item 12 (\u201ccircuit court record\u201d) of the record below, \nidentified by a footer that appears at the bottom of every page. \n\n9 \n \nx Diversified Services, Inc., provides work \nopportunities \nto \nindividuals \nwith \ndevelopmental disabilities. J.A.157\u201361, 164.  \nx Headwaters, \nInc., \nprovides \nservices \nfor \npeople with disabilities, including training \nrelated to daily living and employment, and \nHead \nStart \nhome \nvisitation \nservices. \nJ.A.113\u201340. \n \nThe \naffiliated \norganizations \nincorporate \nno \nworship, religious training, or religious teaching into \ntheir services. Likewise, Petitioners\u2019 employees need \nnot ascribe to the tenets of any religious faith. \nJ.A.198\u2013200, 236\u201338, 257\u201359; R.100:186\u201388. \n \nFederal, state, and local government funding \nsupports much of Petitioners\u2019 operations. J.A.186, \n203, 209, 221\u201322; R.100:99\u2013100, 271\u201372. That federal \nfunding may not be spent on \u201cexplicitly religious \nactivities,\u201d and federally funded operations must be \n\u201cneutral in their treatment of religion.\u201d J.A.197\u201398. \nNone of the affiliated organizations receives funding \nfrom the Diocese of Superior. J.A.222, 241, 244, 248. \n \nPetitioners have long participated in Wisconsin\u2019s \nunemployment \nsystem. \nCatholic \nCharities \nhas \nparticipated since 1971; its initial registration report \ndescribed \nthe \n\u201cnature \nof \nits \noperations\u201d \nas \n\u201ccharitable,\u201d \u201ceducational,\u201d and \u201crehabilitative,\u201d not \n\u201creligious.\u201d Pet.App.490a\u201391a. Three of the four \naffiliates have participated since the 1980s, and the \nother since at least 2015. R.60:38\u201339; 67:5\u20138, 11\u201312. \nAll participate as reimbursable employers, meaning \nthey contribute only the cost of the state benefits \n\n10 \n \npaid to their own laid-off employees, not quarterly \nrisk-adjusted payments. R.61:3\u20137; 67:5.  \nIII. Petitioners \nseek \nan \nexemption \nfrom \nWisconsin\u2019s unemployment system, and the \nWisconsin Supreme Court concludes they \nare not entitled to one. \n \nFor many decades, Petitioners did not claim that \nthey were exempt, even when their activities were \nreligiously motivated. In 2016, however, Petitioners \nsought \na \ndetermination \nfrom \nthe \nWisconsin \nDepartment \nof \nWorkforce \nDevelopment \nthat \nemployment with each organization was exempt from \ncoverage under Wis. Stat. \u00a7 108.02(15)(h)2. The \nDepartment found that they were not \u201coperated \nprimarily for religious purposes\u201d and thus denied \nPetitioners\u2019 \nrequests. \nPet.App.351a\u201369a. \nThe \nWisconsin Labor and Industry Review Commission \naffirmed the Department\u2019s initial determination. \nPet.App.212a\u201375a.  \n \nAfter \nback-and-forth \nlower \ncourt \ndecisions, \nPet.App.125a\u201368a, \n189a-211a, \nthe \nWisconsin \nSupreme Court agreed that Petitioners were not \nentitled to the exemption, Pet.App.1a\u2013122a.  \n \nThe court first held that, in evaluating \u201creligious \npurpose,\u201d it is the \u201cpurpose\u201d of the specific employer \nseeking the exemption that matters, not that of an \naffiliated religious organization. Pet.App.16a\u201319a. \n \nThe court next held that, in determining whether \neach employer operates \u201cprimarily for religious \npurposes,\u201d the State must consider the organization\u2019s \n\u201cactivities \nand \nmotivations.\u201d \nPet.App.21a\u201322a. \n\n11 \n \nThe court accepted at \u201cface value\u201d Petitioners\u2019 \nassertion that their work is religiously motivated, \nPet.App.28a\u201329a, but it declined to find that this \nalone qualified them for the exemption. In doing so, \nthe court analyzed the exemption\u2019s language, the \nanalogous ministerial exemption, FUTA\u2019s legislative \nhistory, and case law interpreting similar language in \nSection 501(c)(3). Pet.App.19a\u201328a. \n \nThe court concluded that Petitioners\u2019 activities \nmirrored those of any secular nonprofit providing \nsimilar services: Petitioners\u2019 religious motivation did \nnot cause the services provided to \u201cdiffer in any \nsense.\u201d Pet.App.30a\u201331a. For instance, Petitioner \nBarron County Developmental Services had operated \nidentically both before and after its affiliation with \nCatholic Charities in 2014. Pet.App.30a. \n \nBecause \nPetitioners \nhad \nrelied \nsolely \non \nmotivations, the court did not need to \u201cexhaustive[ly]\u201d \nlist all relevant factors or specify any \u201cnecessary \nconditions.\u201d Pet.App.26a\u201327a. Distinctively religious \nactivities that could qualify an employer for an \nexemption \ninclude \n\u201cworship \nservices, \nreligious \noutreach, ceremony, or religious education,\u201d but that \nlist \ncould \nbe \n\u201cdifferent \nfor \ndifferent \nfaiths.\u201d \nPet.App.26a\u201327a, 29a. Although the court mentioned \nthat Petitioners did not \u201cattempt to imbue program \nparticipants with the Catholic faith,\u201d it emphasized \nthat this was \u201cnot required\u201d to obtain the exemption; \nrather, it explained that the presence of such activity \nwould be one \u201cstrong indication[ ]\u201d of religious \npurpose. Pet.App.29a. \n\n12 \n \n \nThe \ncourt \nthen \nrejected \nPetitioners\u2019 \nFirst \nAmendment argument. It noted that \u201c\u2018some degree of \ninvolvement\u2019 with religion\u201d is inevitable with any \n\u201cstatutory scheme that offers tax exemption to \nreligious entities.\u201d Pet.App.40a (citation omitted). It \nconcluded that, because Wisconsin\u2019s exemption does \nnot ask whether Petitioners\u2019 \u201cactivities are consistent \nor inconsistent with Catholic doctrine,\u201d it is not \nexcessively entangling. Pet.App.40a. Indeed, an \ninquiry into \u201cthe scope of charitable activities in \nproportion to doctrinal pursuits\u201d is permissible so \nlong as it \u201cdoes not entail judicial inquiry into dogma \nand belief.\u201d Pet.App.39a (citation omitted). The Court \nalso found no violation of the church autonomy \nprinciple because the exemption neither \u201cregulate[d] \ninternal church governance nor mandate[d] any \nactivity.\u201d \nPet.App.45a\u201346a. \nLast, \nit \nfound \nno \nactionable discrimination because Petitioners did not \nassert that participating in state unemployment \ninsurance burdened their religious practices or \nbeliefs. Pet.App.49a\u201350a. \nSUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT \n \nThe Wisconsin Supreme Court rightly rejected \nPetitioners\u2019 First Amendment challenges. \n \nI. Wisconsin\u2019s unemployment exemption does not \nexcessively entangle the state with religion. To the \ncontrary, the exemption aims to avoid entangling the \nstate in employment disputes that turn on religious \nfaith and doctrine. Wisconsin thus must draw lines \nthat identify which organizations present these \nentangling concerns. Because a religious-motive-only \n\n13 \n \ntest would do a poor job, Wisconsin instead searches \nfor distinctively religious activities like worship, \nritual, teaching the faith, or spreading a religious \nmessage\u2014all \nof \nwhich \ncan \npose \nentangling \nunemployment questions when discharging an \nemployee who engages in them. The ministerial \nexemption permissibly asks whether an employee \nengages in these same activities, and so Wisconsin\u2019s \nanalogous \ntest \ndoes \nnot \ncause \nexcessive \nentanglement. \n \nII. Denying Petitioners the exemption does not \ndiscriminate against them in a way the Religion \nClauses forbid. The Establishment Clause allows \nWisconsin to tailor this accommodation to the \nreligious organizations\u2014unlike Petitioners\u2014whose \nemployment decisions might well present entangling \nreligious questions. And doing so does not trigger \nstrict scrutiny under the Free Exercise clause: \nPetitioners \nhave \nno \nreligious \nobjection \nto \nparticipating in the unemployment system; they do \nnot show that Wisconsin targeted their faith; and they \ncannot claim that the exemption favors secular \norganizations over religious ones. But even if the \nexemption triggers heightened scrutiny, it is properly \ntailored to accommodate only those organizations \nthat present entangling unemployment questions. \nWisconsin\u2019s \nsubstantial \ninterest \nin \nbroad \nunemployment \ncoverage \njustifies \nlimiting \nthe \nexemption accordingly. \n \nIII. Denying Petitioners the exemption does not \nviolate the narrow church autonomy principles \nembodied in the Court\u2019s precedents. The Court has \nrejected only state compulsion that operates on \n\n14 \n \ncertain matters of faith and mission: selecting church \nleaders and ministers and resolving ecclesiastical \ndisputes over church property. What Petitioners \nface\u2014at most, minor and incidental economic \nincentives on their corporate affiliation choices\u2014lies \nfar afield from that kind of compulsion. \n \nIV. Contrary to the United States\u2019 position, the \nWisconsin court\u2019s interpretation of the state statute is \nnot properly before this Court. But that court properly \ninterpreted the exemption. Its reading was consistent \nwith the statute\u2019s plain language, context, and \npurpose, \nFUTA\u2019s \nlegislative \nhistory, \ncases \ninterpreting similar language in Section 501(c)(3), \nand state cases applying similar statutes. \nARGUMENT \nI. Examining whether Petitioners engage in \ndistinctively religious activities does not \nexcessively entangle the state with religion. \n \nPetitioners argue that Wisconsin\u2019s one-time \nsearch for distinctively religious activities excessively \nentangles the state in religious matters. Pet.Br.33.  \n \nBut the First Amendment does not bar \u201call \nentanglements,\u201d especially not in the religious \naccommodation context, where \u201c[i]nteraction between \nchurch and state is inevitable.\u201d Agostini v. Felton, \n521 U.S. 203, 233 (1997). In tailoring religious \naccommodations, legislatures and courts must draw \nlines. Any resulting \u201c[e]ntanglement must be \n\u2018excessive\u2019 before it runs afoul of the Establishment \nClause,\u201d id. (citation omitted), which typically entails \n\n15 \n \n\u201cofficial and continuing surveillance\u201d of religious \norganizations, Walz v. Tax Comm\u2019n of New York, \n397 U.S. 664, 675 (1970).  \n \nWisconsin\u2019s \nexemption \ncomplies \nwith \nthese \nprinciples. It requires a one-time examination, not \ncontinuing surveillance, of Petitioners\u2019 activities to \ntailor the accommodation to its disentangling \npurpose: keeping the state out of employment \ndecisions that turn on distinctively religious conduct.  \nA. Line-drawing is inevitable in crafting \nreligious \naccommodations, \nincluding \nthose that seek to avoid state assessment \nof religious questions. \n \nReligious accommodations come in two main \nflavors: those that (like RFRA) lift burdens on \nparticular religious beliefs or practices, and those that \n(like this exemption) exempt a class of religious actors \nto avoid interfering with church autonomy in matters \nof faith and doctrine.  \n \nThe second type typically draws lines to identify \nwhich religious actors face autonomy problems that \ndeserve accommodation (and, by implication, which \ndo not). This Court recognized as much when crafting \nthe ministerial exemption, which does not cover all \nemployees within covered organizations, but rather \nonly those who perform \u201cvital religious duties\u201d that \nare \u201cessential to the institution\u2019s central mission.\u201d \nOur Lady, 591 U.S. at 746, 756. So long as such \nline-drawing does not require ongoing, case-by-case \nsurveillance, it is not excessively entangling. \n\n16 \n \n1. Accommodations may lift burdens on \nparticular religious beliefs or avoid \ninterference with religious faith and \ndoctrine. \n \nOne kind of religious accommodation lifts a \nsubstantial burden on a religious practice or belief \nimposed by otherwise-neutral government action.  \nThat may take the form of a statutory exemption from \na specific program, like the FICA exemption for \n\u201cmember[s] of a recognized religious sect\u201d whose \n\u201cestablished \ntenets \nor \nteachings\u201d \nentail \na \n\u201cconscientious[ ] oppos[ition]\u201d to receiving the \n\u201cbenefits of any private or public insurance.\u201d \n26 U.S.C. \u00a7 1402(g)(1); see also 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1402(e)(1) \n(similar \nexemption \nfor \n\u201cChristian \nScience \npractitioner[s]\u201d), 3127(b). Or it may take the form of a \nRFRA-type statute, which allows claimants to seek \nindividualized exemptions from any government \nactivity that substantially burdens their religious \nbelief or practice. See, e.g., 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000cc-1. Such \nexemptions require no line-drawing; the particular \nbelief or practice that merits accommodation must \nsimply be identified.  \n \nOther accommodations, like this one, do not focus \non whether the law burdens a specific exercise of \nreligion. Rather, they establish an institution- or \nemployee-based exemption in order to \u201calleviate \nsignificant governmental interference with the ability \nof religious organizations to define and carry out their \nreligious missions.\u201d Corp. of Presiding Bishop of \nChurch of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints v. Amos, \n483 U.S. 327, 335 (1987). For instance, the Title VII \n\n17 \n \nexemption for \u201creligious organizations\u201d discussed in \nAmos \nsought \nto \n\u201cminimiz[e] \ngovernmental \n\u2018interfer[ence] with the decision-making process in \nreligions\u201d by allowing them to make employment \ndecisions for religious reasons. Id. at 336 (citation \nomitted). These kinds of accommodation often must \n\u201cmark boundaries,\u201d Walz, 397 U.S. at 670, among \nvarious religiously motivated entities to tailor the \nexemption to those whose religious mission would be \nimpacted by the government action at issue. \n2. To accommodate religious autonomy \nin \nthe \nemployment \ncontext, \nthe \nministerial exemption recognizes the \nneed for functional, activity-focused \ntests.  \n \nThe \nministerial \nexemption \nillustrates \nthe \nfunctional \nline-drawing \nrequired \nby \nreligious \naccommodations that protect religious autonomy in \nmatters of faith and doctrine.  \n \nIn fashioning an exemption for employment \ndiscrimination laws in Hosanna-Tabor and Our Lady, \nthis Court faced its own line-drawing project. It \nrecognized that the state is \u201cbound to stay out of \nemployment disputes involving those holding certain \nimportant positions with churches and other religious \ninstitutions.\u201d Our Lady, 591 U.S. at 746. But \nCongress \nhad \nprovided \nno \nsuch \nstatutory \naccommodation. So, the Court had to step in and fill \nthe void, a project that required tailoring the \nexemption to the \u201ccertain important positions\u201d that \ndeserve it. Id. \n\n18 \n \n \nThe Court arrived at a flexible, activity-focused \ntest: \u201c[w]hat matters, at bottom, is what an employee \ndoes.\u201d Id. at 753. When they \u201cinculcat[e]\u201d the faith\u2014\nas do those who \u201cconduct[ ] worship services or \nimportant religious ceremonies or rituals, or serve[ ] \nas a messenger or teacher of [religious] faith,\u201d \nid. at 753\u201354 (cleaned up)\u2014they likely qualify. \nSee also Hosanna-Tabor, 565 U.S. at 192 (covered \nactivities include religious teaching, worship, and \nritual). These distinctively religious activities\u2014\n\u201creligious \nleadership, \nworship, \nritual, \nand \nexpression\u201d\u2014are \u201cobjective functions\u201d important to \n\u201cany religious group, regardless of its beliefs.\u201d Id. \nat 200 (Alito, J., concurring).   \n \nBut this list is not exhaustive: \u201ca variety of factors \nmay be important,\u201d and some relevant to one case \nmay not \u201cnecessarily [be] important\u201d \u201cin all other \ncases.\u201d Our Lady, 591 U.S. at 751\u201352. Ultimately, the \ntest seeks \u201cto determine whether each particular \nposition implicate[s] the fundamental purpose of the \nexception.\u201d Id. at 758.  \n \nCritically, the Court declined to defer altogether to \nthe organization\u2019s assertion that a position should be \nexempted, \nas \nadvocated \nby \nJustice \nThomas\u2019s \nconcurrence in Our Lady. Rather, the Our Lady \nmajority treated the organization\u2019s own view \nof its employee\u2019s role as \u201cimportant,\u201d but not \ndeterminative. Id. at 757. This rightly recognizes how \nautonomy-preserving accommodations like these \ndiffer from belief-protecting ones. When a particular \nreligious belief or practice is burdened, courts defer to \nsincere claims that claimants hold that belief. But \nwhen an accommodation seeks to avoid interference \n\n19 \n \nwith a religious employer\u2019s autonomy in matters of \nfaith and doctrine, courts (and, by extension, \nlegislatures) can identify objective factors tailored to \nthat goal.3 \n3. Entanglement \nconcerns \nprimarily \narise from ongoing, activity-by-activity \ngovernment surveillance. \n \nThe \nministerial \nexemption \nrecognizes \nthat \noccasional \nsearches \nfor \ndistinctively \nreligious \nactivities permissibly tether certain accommodations \nto their \u201cfundamental purpose.\u201d Our Lady, 591 U.S. \nat 756, 758. But excessive entanglement can \nsometimes result when the government must instead \nengage \nin \n\u201ccontinuing \nsurveillance\u201d \nof \nan \norganization\u2019s activities. Walz, 397 U.S. at 675. The \nentanglement cases on which Petitioners primarily \nrely fall into this category. Pet.Br.33\u201337. \n \nFor example, in New York v. Cathedral Academy, \n434 U.S. 125, 132 (1977), a religious school sought to \nqualify for state aid through a detailed \u201creview \u2026 [of] \nall expenditures for which reimbursement [was] \nclaimed, including all teacher-prepared tests, in order \nto assure that state funds [were] not given for \nsectarian activities.\u201d The Court frowned upon \u201cthis \n \n3 Petitioners also invoke N.L.R.B. v. Catholic Bishop of \nChicago, 440 U.S. 490 (1979), but that case just tracks the \nministerial exemption. Pet.Br.35\u201336. It similarly recognized \nthat subjecting religious schools to NLRB jurisdiction would \nhave created entangling disputes over whether \u201ctheir challenged \nactions were mandated by their religious creeds.\u201d Catholic \nBishop, 440 U.S. at 502. That has little to do with the \nline-drawing questions presented here. \n\n20 \n \nsort of detailed inquiry into the subtle implications of \nin-class examinations and other teaching activities\u201d \nbecause it would have amounted to a \u201csearch for \nreligious meaning in every classroom examination.\u201d \nId. at 132\u201333. Similarly, in Widmar v. Vincent, \n454 U.S. 263, 272 n.11 (1981), the Court required a \nuniversity to allow religious student groups equal \naccess to an open forum, partly because trying to \nexclude religious speech from the forum would create \na \u201ccontinuing need to monitor group meetings to \nensure compliance with the rule.\u201d \n \nAmos is consistent. In rejecting an Establishment \nClause challenge to Title VII\u2019s exemption for religious \norganizations, the Court found a \u201csecular legislative \npurpose\u201d (then required by Lemon v. Kurtzman, \n403 U.S. 602 (1971)) for the exemption\u2019s 1972 \namendment. Amos, 483 U.S. at 335 (citation omitted). \nBefore the amendment, Title VII exempted an \nemployer\u2019s individual \u201creligious activities\u201d; after, \nTitle \nVII \nmore \nbroadly \nexempted \n\u201creligious \nemployers.\u201d Id. at 335\u201336. The Court treated that \nchange as permissible, not required. See id. at 336 \n(\u201cassum[ing]\u201d the prior version was \u201cadequate\u201d). And \nthe potential problem presented by the pre-1972 \nversion was the need for religious employers to \npredict, on a case-by-case basis, which specific \nactivities qualified for the liability exemption\u2014the \ntype of ongoing, activity-by-activity review of which \nWidmar and Cathedral Academy disapproved.  \n \nAnd Mitchell v. Helms, 530 U.S. 793 (2000), was \neven more forgiving. To be sure, the plurality opinion \nrejected the concept of \u201cpervasively sectarian\u201d schools \non the basis that it required \u201ctrolling through a \n\n21 \n \nperson\u2019s or institution\u2019s religious beliefs.\u201d Id. at 828. \nBut Mitchell still upheld aid to a religious school \nwhere the aid could be used only for \u201csecular, neutral, \nand nonideological\u201d purposes and thus did not contain \n\u201cimpermissible content.\u201d Id. at 831 (citation omitted). \nIndeed, the Court credited \u201cmonitoring programs\u201d \nthat ensured aid complied with these limitations, id. \nat 832\u201334, without identifying any entanglement \nconcerns. \nB. Tailoring \nWisconsin\u2019s \nemployment-\nrelated religious accommodation to its \ndisentangling purpose is not excessively \nentangling.  \n \nThe Wisconsin exemption, like the ministerial \nexemption, recognizes that the state sometimes ought \nto avoid employment disputes involving religion, here \nin the unemployment context. In both settings, the \nFirst Amendment permits a functional, one-time \nanalysis \nof \nwhether \neach \n\u201cparticular \n[actor] \nimplicate[s] \nthe \nfundamental \npurpose \nof \nthe \nexception.\u201d Our Lady, 591 U.S. at 758.  \n1. The \nexemption \navoids \nstate \ninterference \nwith \nunemployment \ndecisions touching on religious faith \nand doctrine. \n \nThe \nexemption \naims \nto \n\u201cavoid \nexcessive \nentanglement\u201d and \u201cpreserve[ ] the autonomy and \nfreedom\u201d of certain religious organizations. Walz, \n397 U.S. at 670, 672. Specifically, it avoids entangling \nthe state with unemployment eligibility decisions \n\n22 \n \nthat implicate questions about an employee\u2019s \ndistinctively religious activity. Wisconsin Stat. \n\u00a7 108.02(15)(h) shows as much in how it exempts not \njust churches but also ministers, a specific job \ninvolving religious functions that would present \nemployment disputes the state should \u201cstay out of.\u201d \nOur Lady, 591 U.S. at 746. The First Circuit \nrecognized this disentangling function:  \nEfficient administration of the unemployment \ncompensation system is particularly enhanced \nthrough the exemptions for religion because it \neliminates the need for the government to \nreview employment decisions made on the basis \nof religious rationales. \nRojas v. Fitch, 127 F.3d 184, 188 (1st Cir. 1997); \nsee also Br. for the Fed. Resp\u2019t in Opp\u2019n, Rojas v. Fitch, \nNo. 97-1550, 1998 WL 34103612, *7\u20138 (May 20, 1998) \n(explaining same rationale). \n \nTo tailor the accommodation to employers that \nface this problem, the exemption draws a line between \nthose whose employment decisions would present \ndifficult entangling questions and those whose \ndecisions would not.  \n \nTwo hypotheticals illustrate the distinction. \n \nImagine a Catholic diocese that discharges a \npriest who persists in celebrating the traditional \nTridentine Mass (often called the \u201cLatin Mass\u201d) \nwithout the permission of the diocesan bishop and \nafter repeatedly being asked to stop. See generally \nU.S. Catholic, Can my parish celebrate the Latin \nMass? (Apr. 15, 2024), https://perma.cc/T573-4NN3. \n\n23 \n \nIf the diocese participated in the state unemployment \nsystem, and the priest sought unemployment \nbenefits, the state workforce agency would need to \nresolve whether he was terminated for \u201cmisconduct.\u201d \nWis. Stat. \u00a7 108.04(5). But it could do so only by \nstudying Church-issued documents, such as those \nfrom the Second Vatican Council and official \ncommunications from the Pope.  \n \nThen imagine a religiously affiliated hospital, \noperating no differently than a secular hospital, that \nterminates a nurse for excessive absenteeism. If the \nnurse sought unemployment benefits, the workforce \nagency could resolve any dispute over misconduct \nwithout becoming entangled in questions of religious \ndoctrine.  \n \nWisconsin\u2019s exemption tracks that distinction. \nChurches will regularly present hard questions, and \nso their employees and ministers are categorically \nexempt. Wis. Stat. \u00a7 108.02(15)(h)1., 3. But separate, \nchurch-affiliated organizations might not. So, they \nqualify only if they are \u201coperated primarily for a \nreligious purpose,\u201d Wis. Stat. \u00a7 108.02(15)(h)2., which \ncovers those that primarily perform distinctively \nreligious functions such as religious education or \nworship. This differential treatment flows from the \nbasic \ninsight \nthat \nsome \nkinds \nof \nreligious \norganizations are more likely to present entangling \nproblems than others. \n \nThe accommodation\u2019s disentangling purpose is \nunderscored by how Wisconsin does not exempt \nreligious organizations from all employment-related \nlaws. For instance, religious employers\u2014like all \n\n24 \n \nothers\u2014must \nprovide \nworker\u2019s \ncompensation \ncoverage. See generally Wis. Stat. \u00a7 102.07 (defining \n\u201c[e]mployee\u201d under worker\u2019s compensation statutes). \nUnlike \nunemployment \nbenefit \nclaims, \nwhich \nsometimes require resolving religious disputes over \nmisconduct, workers compensation injury disputes \nraise no entanglement concerns. \n2. Wisconsin\u2019s functional test, like the \nministerial exemption\u2019s, permissibly \ntailors the exemption to its purpose. \n \na. In determining eligibility for the exemption, \nWisconsin performs an analysis analogous to this \nCourt\u2019s \nevaluation \nof \na \nclaimed \nministerial \nexemption. Indeed, the Wisconsin Supreme Court \nexpressly linked its test to the ministerial exemption. \nPet.App.24a\u201326a.  \n \nLike the ministerial exemption, Wisconsin\u2019s \nexemption considers \u201cwhat \u2026 [the organization] does\u201d \nby evaluating a \u201cvariety of factors,\u201d the necessity or \nsufficiency of which may vary from case to case, \ndepending on the organization and religion at issue. \nCompare Our Lady, 591 U.S. at 751, 753, with \nPet.App.26a\u201327a. \nIf \nan \norganization \nprimarily \nengages in distinctively religious activity\u2014namely, \n\u201cworship services, religious outreach, ceremony, or \nreligious education,\u201d Pet.App.29a\u2014it will likely \nqualify for the exemption. Wisconsin\u2019s search for \nthose \u201cobjective functions,\u201d Hosanna-Tabor, 565 U.S. \nat 200 (Alito, J., concurring), parallels how the \nministerial exemption generally covers those who \n\u201cconduct[ ] worship services or important religious \n\n25 \n \nceremonies or rituals, or serve[ ] as a messenger or \nteacher of its faith.\u201d Our Lady, 591 U.S. at 754 \n(cleaned up); see also Hosanna-Tabor, 565 U.S. at 192 \n(examining similar activities).  \n \nBy searching for this kind of distinctively religious \nactivity, both this exemption and the ministerial \nexemption try to identify the kinds of \u201cemployment \ndisputes\u201d that the state ought to \u201cstay out of.\u201d Our \nLady, 591 U.S. at 746. In both situations, the \nexemptions are thereby tailored to ensure that \nexempting each \u201cparticular position [or organization] \nimplicate[s] \nthe \nfundamental \npurpose \nof \nthe \nexception.\u201d Id. at 758. This inquiry is not excessively \nentangling in applying either exemption. \n \nb. Petitioners cannot distinguish away the \nministerial exemption. Pet.Br.37. To be sure, Our \nLady declined to hinge the exemption on either \n\u201csecond-guessing\u201d a church\u2019s credentialing views or \nimposing a \u201cco-religionist\u201d requirement. 591 U.S. at \n759, 761. But the case nevertheless applied a \nfunctional analysis that treated the schools\u2019 own \nviews as \u201cimportant\u201d but not determinative. Id. \nat 757. Petitioners\u2019 preferred approach\u2014more-or-less \ncomplete deference\u2014did not prevail. \n \nMoreover, Petitioners\u2019 appeal to minority religions \nignores how this same sort of issue arose in \nHosanna-Tabor. Pet.Br.40. Not all denominations \nhave ordained ministers, and so courts must instead \n\u201cfocus on the [employee\u2019s] function\u201d to ensure other \nreligions \nreceive \nthe \nexemption\u2019s \nprotection. \nHosanna-Tabor, 565 U.S. at 198, 202 (Alito, J., \nconcurring); see also Our Lady, 591 U.S. at 752\u201353. \n\n26 \n \nBut \nthe \nimportant \nunderlying \nfunctions \nare \nperformed by \u201cany religious group, regardless of its \nbeliefs.\u201d Hosanna-Tabor, 565 U.S. at 200 (Alito, J., \nconcurring).  \n \nThe same is true here. If an organization affiliated \nwith a minority religion engages in distinctively \nreligious activity of the kind that would pose \nentangling unemployment questions, it will receive \nan exemption. To be sure, any religion\u2014large or \nsmall\u2014needs to identify the activities in question. \nBut they will invariably involve the \u201cobjective \nfunctions\u201d that \u201cany religious group\u201d performs, id., \nand so the state can sensitively evaluate such claims \nmade by all religions.  \n \nc. Wisconsin\u2019s search for distinctively religious \nactivities like \u201cworship services, religious outreach, \nceremony, or religious education,\u201d Pet.App.29a, (or \nsomething similar) also parallels a search this Court, \nthe federal government, and Petitioners themselves \nhave long performed in the context of direct \ngovernment aid to faith-based organizations.  \n \nLaws allowing faith-based organizations to receive \nstate funds, but not for distinctively religious \npurposes, are ubiquitous. Consider, for example, the \n\u201cCharitable Choice\u201d provisions of 1996\u2019s welfare \nreform legislation. See Ira C. Lupu, Robert W. Tuttle, \nThe Faith-Based Initiative and the Constitution, \n55 DePaul L. Rev. 1, 6\u20137 (2005). Generally, such \nprovisions allow faith-based organizations to receive \ngovernment \ncontracts \nand \ngrants \nfor \ncertain \nwelfare-related services, but only if they do not use \n\n27 \n \ngovernment funds for \u201csectarian worship, instruction, \nor proselytization,\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 604a(j).  \n \nPresident George W. Bush\u2019s Faith-Based and \nCommunity Initiative expanded this project, but it \nstill did not allow participating organizations to use \nfunding for \u201cinherently religious activities, such as \nworship, religious instruction, and proselytization.\u201d \nExec. Order No. 13,279, 67 Fed. Reg. 77,141, 77,142 \n(2002). The Obama Administration clarified that this \nrestriction covers \u201cexplicitly religious\u201d activities \nrather than \u201cinherently religious\u201d ones, reasoning \nthat while \u201csome might consider the provision \nof a hot meal to a needy person an \u2018inherently \nreligious\u2019 act when it is undertaken from a sense of \nreligious motivation or obligation,\u201d that has \u201cno \novert \nreligious \ncontent\u201d \nthat \nwould \nprevent \ngovernment funding. President\u2019s Advisory Council on \nFaith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships, Report \nof Recommendations to the President (Mar. 2010), \nat 129\u201330, https://perma.cc/7M6B-RYY8; see also \n81 Fed. Reg. 19,355, 19,358\u201359 (2016). \n \nThese limitations still exist today. See, e.g., \n2 C.F.R. \u00a7 3474.15(d)(1) (Dep\u2019t of Educ. aid cannot be \nused to fund \u201cexplicitly religious activities, such as \nworship, religious instruction, or proselytization\u201d). \nThe Trump Administration\u2019s recent executive order \non this topic modified other aspects of the faith-based \ninitiative, but not this one. See Exec. Order \nNo. 14,205, 90 Fed. Reg. 9,499 (2025). \n \nThese direct aid limitations reflect this Court\u2019s \nprecedents, which have prohibited direct government \naid to religious organizations that is used for \n\n28 \n \n\u201cspecifically religious activities.\u201d See, e.g., Bowen v. \nKendrick, 487 U.S. 589, 613 (1988) (approving aid \nthat funded \u201cfacially neutral projects\u201d that were \u201cnot \nthemselves \n\u2018specifically \nreligious \nactivities\u2019\u201d). \nWhether or not the Establishment Clause indeed \nrequires such limits, such cases have drawn very \nsimilar lines to the ones Wisconsin has drawn here. \n \nPetitioners administer this very same limitation \nwhen receiving federal aid. Catholic Charities \nreceives most of its funding from government \ncontracts and grants, including grants that cannot be \nused for \u201cexplicitly religious activities.\u201d J.A.198; \n24 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.109(e) (HUD regulations). The affiliated \nPetitioners receive federal grant money with the same \nkinds of restrictions. See 7 C.F.R. \u00a7 16.4(b) (Dep\u2019t of \nAgric. regulations); 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 87.3(d) (HHS \nregulations). \nCatholic \nCharities \nUSA \nlikewise \nrecognizes that its affiliates must abide by these \n\u201cpermitted use\u201d restrictions to keep receiving \ngovernment funds. C.C.USA.Br.9\u201310 n.5. \n \nBecause it has not been excessively entangling for \nPetitioners and other state aid recipients to apply the \nlimitations derived from cases like Kendrick, it cannot \nbe excessively entangling for Wisconsin to consider \nwhether Petitioners engage in those same activities \nhere. \n3. The exemption\u2019s line-drawing requires \nno \nongoing, \nactivity-by-activity \nsurveillance. \n \nWisconsin\u2019s \nexemption \ndoes \nnot \nrequire \na \n\u201ccontinuing day-to-day relationship\u201d between church \n\n29 \n \nand state, Walz, 397 U.S. at 674, and so Petitioners\u2019 \nreliance on Cathedral Academy, Widmar, and Amos \ndoes not help them. Pet.Br.33\u201334, 36\u201337. The \nexemption\u2019s one-time eligibility decision is nothing \nlike the case-by-case, \u201cdetailed inquiry into the subtle \nimplications of in-class examinations\u201d in Cathedral \nAcademy, 434 U.S. at 132, \u201ccontinu[ally] \u2026 \nmonitor[ing]\u201d meetings to determine whether speech \ncontains religious content as in Widmar, 454 U.S. \nat 272 n.11, or ongoing activity-by-activity liability \npredictions of the kind that drove the congressional \namendment of Title VII discussed in Amos, 483 U.S. \nat 336. \nC. Petitioners misconstrue Wisconsin\u2019s test, \nappeal to inapposite sincerity principles, \nand advance a test that would raise its \nown constitutional problems. \n \nPetitioners\u2019 entanglement theory rests on a false \npremise: that Wisconsin\u2019s exemption hinges on \n\u201c[t]ypical\u201d religious activities and decides \u201cwhat is \nreligious.\u201d Pet.Br.38, 40 (alteration in original) \n(citation omitted). In reality, Wisconsin\u2019s test is \nconsistent with the Court\u2019s ministerial exemption and \ndirect government aid cases. Petitioners also rely on \ncases regarding burdens placed on particular \nreligious beliefs, but they have never identified a \nreligious belief that collides with Wisconsin\u2019s \nunemployment system. And their test invites \nconstitutional \nproblems. \nBy \nuntethering \nthe \nexemption from its purpose, their approach raises \nEstablishment Clause concerns that might encourage \n\n30 \n \nlegislatures \nto \nnarrow \nor \neliminate \nsuch \naccommodations altogether. \n1. Petitioners misconstrue Wisconsin\u2019s \ntest. \n \nPetitioners\u2019 selective reading of the Wisconsin \ncourt\u2019s decision does not reflect its true holding. \nThe court used the word \u201c[t]ypical\u201d only once, teeing \nup \na \nlist \nof \nactivities\u2014\u201cworship,\u201d \n\u201cpastoral \ncounseling,\u201d \u201cchurch ceremon[y],\u201d and \u201ceducation\u201d in \n\u201cdoctrine\u201d\u2014which \nit \ndescribed \nas \nmerely \n\u201cillustrati[ve], not \u201crequire[d],\u201d of an organization \nthat might merit exemption. Pet.App.26a\u201327a (first \nalteration in original) (citation omitted). And the \ncourt expressly did not treat this as an exclusive \nlist, even noting that such activities vary among \nreligions. Pet.App.26a\u201327a. This analysis cannot \nbe \nunconstitutional \nbecause \nit \nsearches \nfor \npractically the same distinctively religious functions \nthat the ministerial exemption and direct aid cases \ndo. See Hosanna-Tabor, 565 U.S. at 192; Our Lady, \n591 U.S. at 754; Kendrick, 487 U.S. at 613.4  \n \nSimilarly, the Wisconsin court never said that \nPetitioners\u2019 decision to serve non-Catholics without \nproselytizing \ndisqualified \nthem. \nRather, \nit \nemphasized that these factors were \u201cnot required,\u201d \nsimply noting how\u2014if present\u2014they \u201cwould be strong \n \n4 Cf. Reply Br. for Pet\u2019rs, Our Lady of Guadalupe Sch. v. \nMorrissey-Berru, Nos. 19-267, 19-348, 2020 WL 1810070, *4\u20137 \n(Apr. 3, 2020) (denying that searching for these functions \u201cwould \nforce courts to decide religious questions,\u201d because it is no \u201cgreat \nmystery what religious functions are objectively important\u201d).  \n\n31 \n \nindications\u201d \nof \nan \nemployer\u2019s \nexempt \nstatus. \nPet.App.29a. Petitioners were ultimately denied the \nexemption because they identified no distinctively \nreligious activities whatsoever, not just a lack of \nproselytization.  \n \nNor did the court undertake to decide \u201cwhich \nactivities can be religious and which ones can\u2019t.\u201d \nPet.Br.38. The court \u201caccept[ed]\u201d that Petitioners\u2019 \nreligious motivation drove their charitable work. \nPet.App.28a\u201329a. It simply held that religiously \nmotivated work, standing alone, does not suffice. That \nwas entirely proper, given how an employer whose \noperations are \u201creligious\u201d solely due to its motivation \nlikely \npresents \nno \nentangling \nunemployment \nquestions\u2014as was true during Petitioners\u2019 decades of \nparticipation in Wisconsin\u2019s system. As the court \nrightly observed, such an organization\u2019s activities \noutwardly mimic those of a comparable secular \nemployer, \nPet.App.30a, \nwhich \nis \na \n\u201crelevant\u201d \nconsideration, Hosanna-Tabor, 565 U.S. at 193. In \nneither case will employment decisions rest on \nentangling religious questions.  \n \nBy looking for distinctively religious activities \n(like worship services, religious outreach, ceremony, \nor religious education), the Wisconsin court simply \naligned the exemption with its basic disentangling \npurpose.  \n2. Cases addressing the sincerity of \nreligious belief are inapt here. \n \nBecause, \nlike \nthe \nministerial \nexemption, \nWisconsin\u2019s exemption turns on distinctively religious \n\n32 \n \nactivity \nindicative \nof \nentangling \nemployment \nquestions\u2014not religious belief per se\u2014Petitioners\u2019 \nsincere religious beliefs are beside the point. \nPet.Br.40\u201342.  \n \nPetitioners\u2019 reliance on the sincerity principle \nconflates the two kinds of accommodations discussed \nabove. Accommodations like RFRA and 26 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1402(g) aim to lift burdens on specific religious \nexercise. \nTo \nevaluate \nclaims \nfor \nthose \naccommodations, a sincere assertion of religious belief \ntriggers protection. Pet.Br.36\u201337 (citing Thomas v. \nRev. Bd. of Ind. Emp. Sec. Div., 450 U.S. 707, 715\u201316 \n(1981); Fowler v. Rhode Island, 345 U.S. 67, 69\u201370 \n(1953)); Pet.Br.41\u201342 (citing cases like Holt v. Hobbs, \n574 U.S. 352, 369 (2015)).  \n \nThe \nexemption \nhere \nis \nunlike \nthose \naccommodations: it does not seek to alleviate burdens \non specific religious beliefs or practices. Rather, it \nseeks to preserve the religious autonomy of \norganizations \nlikely \nto \npresent \nentangling \nunemployment questions. An employer\u2019s sincere \nreligious belief does not mean an organization\u2019s \ndecision to discharge an employee poses such \nquestions. Catholic Charities is a perfect example\u2014it \nsincerely believes that its Catholic faith requires it to \ndo charity, but it identifies no resulting religious \nproblems with participating in the unemployment \nsystem. So, Catholic Charities\u2019 sincere belief does \nnot \ndetermine \nPetitioners\u2019 \neligibility \nfor \nthe \naccommodation.  \n\n33 \n \n3. A \nmotive-only \ntest \nwould \nraise \nEstablishment Clause concerns. \n \nPetitioners\u2019 motive-only test also would raise \nEstablishment Clause concerns that Wisconsin\u2019s \ntailored approach avoids.  \n \nWhere \u201cgovernment acts with the proper purpose \nof lifting a regulation that burdens the exercise of \nreligion,\u201d such an exemption ordinarily need not \n\u201ccome[ ] packaged with benefits to secular entities.\u201d \nAmos, 483 U.S. at 338. But when an exemption is \narbitrarily denied to those who \u201cdo not practice \u2026 any \n[religion] at all,\u201d potential Establishment Clause \nproblems arise. Am. Legion v. Am. Humanist Ass\u2019n, \n588 U.S. 29, 87 (2019) (Gorsuch, J., concurring) (citing \nTex. Monthly, Inc. v. Bullock, 489 U.S. 1, 7\u20138 (1989) \n(plurality op.)); see also Walz, 397 U.S. at 673 \n(religious property tax exemption upheld partly \nbecause it was accompanied by a \u201cbroad class\u201d of \nsecular exemptions).  \n \nConsider again a religiously affiliated hospital \nthat makes employment decisions without reference \nto religious questions. Even though that hospital \nwould not face the entanglement problem that drives \nthis \naccommodation, \nPetitioners\u2019 \ntest \nwould \npresumably exempt it. But a comparable secular \nhospital would not receive the exemption, even \nthough its employment decisions rest on the very \nsame nonreligious factors. This disparate result \nraises concerns, as it denies the secular hospital an \nexemption precisely because it \u201cdo[es] not practice \u2026 \nany [religion] at all.\u201d Am. Legion, 588 U.S. at 87 \n(Gorsuch, J., concurring). \n\n34 \n \n \nEven if that differential treatment did not violate \nthe Establishment Clause, crimping legislatures\u2019 \nability to tether religious accommodations to their \npurpose might make them far more reluctant to enact \naccommodations in the first place. Simply put, \n\u201c[l]egislatures may not be willing to exempt the \nCatholic parish from some requirement if it \nmeans having to exempt the Catholic hospital \u2026.\u201d \nLund Br. 15.  \nII. Denying Petitioners an exemption does not \nunconstitutionally \ndiscriminate \nagainst \nthem. \n \nPetitioners also assert that Wisconsin\u2019s exemption \nunconstitutionally \u201cdiscriminates among religions.\u201d \nPet.Br.43. But the Establishment Clause permits \nlegislatures to limit religious accommodations to the \ngroups that face a religious liberty problem. Here, the \nexemption is permissibly tailored to religious \nemployers whose participation in the unemployment \nsystem would pose entangling questions of religious \nfaith and doctrine.    \n \nThis targeted accommodation does not trigger \nstrict Free Exercise scrutiny, either. Subjecting \nPetitioners to the unemployment system does not \nburden their exercise of religious faith, target them as \na disfavored religion, or amount to preferential \ntreatment for secular groups over religious ones. And \nwhile \nheightened \nscrutiny \nshould \nnot \napply, \nWisconsin\u2019s substantial interests would satisfy it \nanyway.  \n\n35 \n \n \nAt bottom, Petitioners\u2019 discrimination theory \nthreatens the entire project of crafting targeted \nreligious accommodations and thus itself poses a \nserious threat to religious liberty. \nA. The \nEstablishment \nClause \npermits \nlegislatures to enact targeted exemptions \nlike this one. \n1. Religious accommodations historically \nhave been tailored to certain religious \nentities but not others. \n \nPetitioners rest their Establishment Clause \nchallenge on the general principles that the \ngovernment may not \u201cprefer one religion over \nanother\u201d and \u201cmust be neutral\u201d among religions. \nPet.Br.43 (citing Everson v. Bd. of Educ. of Ewing \nTwp., 330 U.S. 1, 15 (1947); Zorach v. Clauson, \n343 \nU.S. \n306, \n314 \n(1952)). \nBut \n\u201cthe \nsame \nconstitutional principle may operate very differently \nin different contexts,\u201d and so \u201cdifferent categories of \nEstablishment Clause cases \u2026 may call for different \napproaches.\u201d Bd. of Educ. of Kiryas Joel Vill. Sch. \nDist. v. Grumet, 512 U.S. 687, 718 (1994) (O\u2019Connor, \nJ., concurring).  \n \nReligious accommodations are such a context. \nAccommodations that seek to alleviate interference \nwith religious practice are \u201can accepted part of \nour political and cultural heritage.\u201d Id. at 723 \n(Kennedy, J., concurring) (citation omitted). But most \naccommodations \u201cseek[ ] to solve a problem that \napplies to members of only one or a few religions,\u201d \nid. at 747 (Scalia, J., dissenting), given how \n\n36 \n \nstate-imposed burdens may not necessarily fall \nevenly on all religions.  \n \nFor instance, seventeenth-century Quakers in \nNew York received accommodations to testify by \naffirmation rather than oath, id. at 723 (Kennedy, J., \nconcurring), an accommodation reflected in the \nfederal constitution, id. at 744 (Scalia, J., dissenting). \nMore recently, a miliary draft exemption was \nextended only to those with religious objections to all \nwar (not just to specific wars). See Gillette v. United \nStates, \n401 \nU.S. \n437 \n(1971). \nSuch \ntargeted \naccommodations do not automatically require courts \nto \u201ceither nullify the [accommodation] or somehow \nextend [it] \u2026 to cover all religions.\u201d Id. at 451. \n \nThat does not mean such accommodations are \ninsulated from review. But \u201ca claimant alleging \n\u2018gerrymander\u2019 must be able to show the absence of a \nneutral, secular basis for the lines government has \ndrawn.\u201d Id. at 452. When an accommodation\u2019s line \nserves \u201cconsiderations of a pragmatic nature\u201d having \n\u201cnothing to do with a design to foster or favor any sect, \nreligion, or cluster of religions,\u201d the Establishment \nClause is not offended. Id. at 452\u201353.  \n \nThere is similarly no cause for concern if religious \ngroups are left out of the accommodation because they \ndo not face the \u201csame burden on [their] religious \npractice\u201d the accommodation is meant to address. \nKiryas Joel, 512 U.S. at 727 (Kennedy, J., concurring). \nOrdinarily, a legislature\u2019s choice \u201cto accommodate the \nburdens unique to one religious group \u2026 raise[s] no \nconstitutional problems.\u201d Id. at 728 (Kennedy, J., \nconcurring).  \n\n37 \n \n2. Wisconsin\u2019s exemption complies with \nthose principles. \n \nThe exemption\u2019s purpose\u2014avoiding interference \nwith employment decisions that may turn on faith \nand \ndoctrine\u2014is \na \n\u201csecular\u201d \nand \n\u201cpragmatic\u201d \nconsideration that does not raise concerns about \nfavoring particular religions. Gillette, 401 U.S. \nat 452\u201353. And the accommodation seeks to \u201csolve a \nproblem\u201d that Petitioners do not even claim to face. \nKiryas Joel, 512 U.S. at 747 (Scalia, J., dissenting). \n \nPetitioners object that they were left out because \nthey provide their services in an ecumenical, \nnon-proselytizing manner. Pet.Br.46\u201347. But that \nmischaracterizes \nwhy \nthey \nwere \ndenied \nthis \naccommodation: it was not because they do not \nproselytize or serve only Catholics, but because they \nidentified no distinctively religious activity that \nwould create difficulty in resolving unemployment \ndisputes. \nThat \nreflects \na \nsensibly \ntailored \naccommodation, not invidious discrimination. \nB. This Court has not recognized a Free \nExercise claim in this context. \n \nPetitioners\u2019 Free Exercise theory fails for the same \nbasic reasons as above. Since tailoring Wisconsin\u2019s \nexemption to religious groups who face entangling \nreligious questions complies with the Establishment \nClause, leaving out groups that don\u2019t face these \nproblems cannot violate the Free Exercise Clause. \nSee \nGillette, \n401 \nU.S. \nat \n448\u201360 \n(rejecting \nEstablishment Clause and Free Exercise claims for \nsame reasons). \n\n38 \n \n \nMoreover, \nPetitioners\u2019 \nFree \nExercise \ndiscrimination theory extends well beyond this \nCourt\u2019s precedents. Free Exercise protects claimants \nagainst substantial burdens on the exercise of their \nfaith, but Petitioners never assert that participating \nin Wisconsin\u2019s unemployment system burdens their \nreligious practice. Petitioners cite cases that bar \ntargeting specific faiths or advantaging secular \ngroups over religious ones, but this exemption \npresents neither scenario. \n1. Under Smith or any other test, a Free \nExercise claim requires a substantial \nburden on the claimant\u2019s practice of \nher religious faith. \n \na. Whether viewed under Employment Division, \nDepartment of Human Resources of Oregon v. Smith, \n494 U.S. 872 (1990), Sherbert v. Verner, 374 U.S. 398 \n(1963), or any test, meritorious Free Exercise claims \nfeature a common core: a substantial burden on the \nclaimant\u2019s exercise of her religious practice. \u201c[I]t is \nnecessary in a free exercise case for one to show the \ncoercive effect of the enactment as it operates against \nhim in the practice of his religion.\u201d Sch. Dist. of \nAbington Twp. v. Schempp, 374 U.S. 203, 222\u201323 \n(1963).   \n \nA government program that directly restricts \ncertain religious practices creates one type of \ncognizable burden. In Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye, \nInc. v. City of Hialeah, 508 U.S. 520, 524\u201328 (1993), \nmembers of the Santeria faith faced fines and \nimprisonment if they engaged in a religious ritual. \n\n39 \n \nLikewise, Niemotko v. Maryland, 340 U.S. 268, \n272\u201373 (1951), involved Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses who \nwere denied the opportunity to preach in a public \npark. And in United States v. Lee, 455 U.S. 252, 254 \n(1982), a member of the Old Order Amish objected on \nreligious grounds to paying FICA and FUTA taxes to \nsupport public insurance benefits for his employees. \n \nA burden may also arise when a believer can enjoy \na generally available benefit only by forgoing her \nreligious practice or beliefs. So, in Sherbert, a \nSeventh-day Adventist could either accept work on \nSaturday, violating her religion, or follow her \nreligious beliefs and lose both her job and \nunemployment benefits. 374 U.S. at 404. And in \nFulton v. City of Philadelphia, 593 U.S. 522, 530 \n(2021), a Catholic adoption agency could either forgo \nparticipation in the city\u2019s adoption program or \nparticipate but endorse family relationships that \nviolated its faith.  \n \nIn contrast, paying a tax does not, by itself, impose \na cognizable Free Exercise burden. In Jimmy \nSwaggart Ministries v. Board of Equalization of \nCalifornia, 493 U.S. 378, 391 (1990), appellants did \nnot object to the sales and use tax on religious \ngrounds, and the Court made clear that the burden of \npaying \na \ngenerally \napplicable \ntax \n\u201cis \nnot \nconstitutionally significant.\u201d See also Hernandez v. \nC.I.R., 490 U.S. 680, 699 (1989) (appellant did not \nobject on religious grounds to paying the tax at issue). \n \nb. Petitioners do not identify any cognizable Free \nExercise burden. They differ from the claimants in \nChurch of Lukumi, Niemotko, and Lee because they \n\n40 \n \nnever \nargue \nthat \nreimbursing \nthe \nstate \nunemployment system for the benefits paid to their \nlaid-off employees would violate their religious faith.   \n \nAnd Petitioners also differ from the claimants in \nSherbert and Fulton. This accommodation is not \nequivalent to a generally available benefit, precisely \nbecause it is targeted at specific religious groups who \npresent \nentangling \nunemployment \nquestions. \nBecause a legislature\u2019s choice \u201cto accommodate the \nburdens unique to one religious group \u2026 raise[s] no \nconstitutional problems,\u201d Kiryas Joel, 512 at 728 \n(Kennedy, J., concurring), it cannot be a cognizable \n\u201cburden\u201d for Petitioners to be denied a targeted \naccommodation that solves a problem they do not \neven purport to face.  \n \nPetitioners are thus left only with their benefit \nreimbursement obligation. That does not even \namount to a \u201ctax\u201d\u2014Petitioners merely reimburse the \nState for any unemployment benefits their employees \nhave received. But even if Petitioners did pay a tax, it \nwould be insufficient under Jimmy Swaggert and \nHernandez.5 \n \n5 Determining eligibility for this statutory accommodation \nalso \ndoes \nnot \ntrigger \nstrict \nscrutiny \nunder \nFulton\u2019s \nindividualized exemption rule. There, a city refused to extend \nexemptions from contracting requirements to cases of religious \nhardship. Fulton, 593 U.S. at 535. This case is the opposite\u2014\nWisconsin has extended statutory exemptions specifically to \nreligious employers with an accommodation need. \n\n41 \n \n2. Cases involving intentional targeting \nof disfavored groups, or favoring of \nsecular over religious groups, have no \nrelevance to Petitioners\u2019 claims here. \n \nLacking any substantial burden on their religious \npractice, Petitioners focus on alleged differential \ntreatment. In their view, the mere difference in \neligibility between organizations that engage in \ndistinctively religious activity and those that do not \ntriggers strict scrutiny.  \n \nThe Court has never applied strict scrutiny simply \nbased on a disparate treatment of that kind\u2014one that \nresults \nfrom \ncountless \ntargeted \nreligious \naccommodations. Rather, strict scrutiny is triggered \nonly where the state intentionally discriminates \nagainst a disfavored denomination or treats religious \norganizations worse than secular ones. Neither \nscenario is present here.  \n \na. When the state intentionally discriminates \nagainst a disfavored religious denomination by \nimposing unique burdens or prohibitions on its \nreligious \npractice, \nsuch \ntargeting \nsurvives \nconstitutional review only if it satisfies strict scrutiny. \n \nIn Church of Lukumi, the central \u201cobject of the \n[challenged] ordinances\u201d that barred certain forms of \nanimal slaughter was \u201csuppression \u2026 of the Santeria \nworship service.\u201d 508 U.S. at 534. Copious evidence \nrevealed \u201cimproper targeting of Santeria sacrifice,\u201d \nand such \u201ca law targeting religious beliefs as such is \nnever permissible.\u201d  Id. at 533, 538. \n\n42 \n \n \nSimilarly, in Larson v. Valente, 456 U.S. 228, 255 \n(1982), the Court highlighted a state legislature\u2019s \n\u201cexpress design\u201d to single out Unification Church \nmembers for statutory registration requirements that \nwere not imposed on other organizations. The Court \npointed to evidence that the legislature passed the \nlaw to discriminate against this disfavored religious \ngroup while consciously ensuring that a Catholic \nArchdiocese would remain unaffected. Id. at 254; \nsee also Niemotko, 340 U.S. at 272\u201373 (invalid \npreaching bar arose from city\u2019s \u201cdislike for or \ndisagreement with\u201d Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses). \n \nThis Court has declined to broaden Larson or \nChurch of Lukumi beyond their facts. See Lynch v. \nDonnelly, 465 U.S. 668, 687 n.13 (1984) (noting that \nLarson applies only to government acts that are \n\u201cpatently discriminatory on [their] face\u201d); Locke v. \nDavey, 540 U.S. 712, 720 (2004) (declining to \u201cextend \nthe Lukumi line of cases well beyond not only their \nfacts but their reasoning\u201d). \n \nb. Petitioners also point to cases treating religion \nworse than comparable secular activity, like Carson \nv. Makin, 596 U.S. 767 (2022), Tandon v. Newsom, \n593 U.S. 61 (2021), and Roman Catholic Diocese of \nBrooklyn v. Cuomo, 592 U.S. 14 (2020). Pet.Br.43\u201345. \nThere, unequal treatment between religious and \nsecular groups triggered strict scrutiny. Carson, \n596 U.S. at 780\u201381; Tandon, 593 U.S. at 62; Cuomo, \n592 U.S. at 18. \n \nc. Wisconsin\u2019s exemption implicates neither line \nof cases. Petitioners have never identified any \nevidence that this exemption was intentionally \n\n43 \n \ncrafted to leave out certain groups for invidious \nreasons, unlike in Church of Lukumi and Larson. \nAnd it presents the opposite scenario from the \nsecular-favoring treatment in Carson, Tandon, and \nCuomo: Wisconsin offers organizations that operate \nfor religious purposes an exemption that comparable \nsecular organizations cannot obtain.6 \n3. Strict scrutiny does not apply here, but \nWisconsin would satisfy a heightened \nscrutiny standard. \n \na. Petitioners fail to show that any of the three \nsituations where the Court has applied strict \nscrutiny\u2014state action substantially burdening a \nclaimant\u2019s religious practice, intentionally targeting \nreligious exercise with regulation, or favoring secular \norganizations over religious ones\u2014exists here. \nFurthermore, the narrow tailoring required by strict \nscrutiny is ill suited for religious exemption statutes, \nwhich prospectively seek to avoid conflicts with \nreligion through generally worded, forward-looking \nlaws. It is not easy to draw perfect lines in this \ncontext, and legislatures should not be required to do \nso or else face strict scrutiny.  \n \nb. But Wisconsin\u2019s exemption would satisfy a \nheightened scrutiny standard if this Court imposed \n \n6 Carson, 596 U.S. at 780, like Sherbert and Fulton, also \ninvolved the denial of a generally available benefit\u2014there, \npublic funding\u2014due to a school\u2019s religious nature. Again, this \ncase differs fundamentally because it does not involve a \ngenerally available benefit but rather a tailored religious \naccommodation.  \n\n44 \n \none. It is narrowly tailored to avoid entangling the \nstate with employment decisions touching on \nreligious faith and doctrine.  \n \nAnd its interests are compelling. In Lee and \nHernandez, the Court observed that the government\u2019s \ninterest in operating its Social Security and tax \nsystems was a \u201cbroad public interest\u201d that justified \neven substantial burdens. Lee, 455 U.S. at 260; \nHernandez, 490 U.S. at 700. Here, Wisconsin\u2019s \ncentury-long commitment to ensuring unemployment \ncoverage for its citizens, along with Congress\u2019s 1970 \ndecision to expand FUTA to include employees of \nnon-profit organizations, demonstrates a compelling \npublic interest that justifies tailoring the exemption \nto employers who actually present entangling \nunemployment questions. \n \nWisconsin\u2019s interest is even stronger here than in \nLee and Hernandez because an exemption causes \nconcrete harm: the \u201cheavy social cost\u201d of depriving the \nunemployed of benefits. Wis. Stat. \u00a7 108.01(1). This is \nnot a tax exemption that simply leaves less money in \nstate coffers to spread around. \nRather, this \nunemployment insurance exemption leaves real \npeople out in the cold, stripped of this longstanding \nsocial safety net.7 Petitioners have never identified \nany religious burdens from participating in this \nsystem, and so Wisconsin\u2019s compelling public interest \n \n7 Petitioners may have a backup private system (which lacks \nany due process right to judicial review), but there is no \nstatutory requirement that other exempted employers create \nbackups too. \n\n45 \n \nin addressing the \u201curgent public problem\u201d of \nunemployment should prevail. Id. \nC. Petitioners\u2019 theory threatens the validity \nof countless accommodations, including \nthe ministerial exemption itself. \n \nIn Petitioners\u2019 apparent view, the Religion \nClauses \nbar \nany \naccommodation \nthat \ncovers \nsomething less than all religiously oriented groups, \nbecause \nsuch \naccommodations \nimproperly \ndiscriminate against left-out groups. But such \naccommodations \u201cnecessarily have boundaries,\u201d and \nso Petitioners\u2019 theory presents a \u201cmortal threat to \nthousands of specific religious exemptions crafted by \nlegislatures\u201d nationwide. Br. of Baptist Joint Comm. \nfor Religious Liberty, Zubik v. Burwell, Nos. 14-1418, \net al., 2016 WL 692850, *28\u201338 (Feb. 17, 2016).  \n \nTo \nbegin, \nit \nis \nunclear \nhow \neven \nthe \nministerial exemption could withstand Petitioners\u2019 \ndiscrimination theory. Consider a charitable religious \norganization whose employees engage in prayer, \nritual, \nand \nreligious \nteaching \nwith \nservice \nrecipients\u2014those employees would likely qualify for \nthe ministerial exemption. Cf. Our Lady, 591 U.S. \nat 750\u201351. But Petitioners\u2019 employees would not \nqualify, precisely because they do not (and, as \nPetitioners say, cannot) engage in those activities. So, \none \norganization \nis \nlargely \nfreed \nfrom \nantidiscrimination law while Petitioners are not. If \nPetitioners are right, the differential result caused by \nthe ministerial exemption\u2014itself constitutionally \n\n46 \n \ncompelled\u2014would apparently be unconstitutional. \nThat cannot be correct. \n \nMany other religious accommodations cover \nsomething less than all religious organizations. FICA \nexempts only \u201cChristian Science practitioner[s]\u201d and \n\u201cmember[s] of \u2026 recognized religious sect[s]\u201d \nwho object to social insurance programs. 26 U.S.C. \n\u00a7\u00a7 1402(g)(1), 1402(e)(1), 3127(b). The Internal \nRevenue Code specially protects \u201cchurches\u201d and the \n\u201cexclusively religious activities\u201d of \u201creligious order[s].\u201d \n26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 508(c)(1)(A) (no tax-exempt status \nfiling requirement), 6033(a)(3)(A)(iii) (no annual \ninformational return requirement); 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7611 \n(audit \nprotections). \nERISA \nexempts \nplans \n\u201cestablished and maintained . . . by a church or by a \nconvention or association of churches.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1002(33)(A). \n \nOther examples abound. See, e.g., 26 U.S.C. \n\u00a7\u00a7 1402(c)(4), 3121(b)(8)(A) (excluding from FICA \ntaxes \u201cservice performed by a duly ordained, \ncommissioned, or licensed minister of a church in the \nexercise of his ministry or by a member of a religious \norder in the exercise of duties required by such \norder\u201d); 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5000A(d)(2)(A)(i)(II) (excluding \nfrom Affordable Care Act\u2019s insurance mandate a \nmember of a \u201csect \u2026 who relies solely on a religious \nmethod of healing\u201d); 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5000A(d)(2)(B)(ii)(II) \n(excluding from ACA insurance mandate members of \norganization which \u201cshare[s] a common set of ethical \nor religious beliefs and share[s] medical expenses \namong members in accordance with those beliefs\u201d); \n26 U.S.C. \u00a7 107 (taxable income of \u201cminister[s] of the \n\n47 \n \ngospel\u201d does not include value of their parsonage \nbenefit). \n \nIf targeted accommodations like these were \ninvalid, legislatures again would be put in a difficult \nposition. They would have to exempt either everyone \nor no one, and Justice Kennedy observed that \u201c[i]t \nwould take a court bolder than this one to predict ... \nthat extension, not invalidation, would be the \nprobable choice.\u201d Kiryas Joel, 512 U.S. at 727 \n(Kennedy, J., concurring) (quoting Olsen v. Drug Enf\u2019t \nAdmin., 878 F.2d 1458, 1464 (D.C. Cir. 1989)); see also \nBr. of Baptist Joint Comm., 2016 WL 692850, *34 \n(noting \u201cpolitical pressure to repeal thousands of \nnarrow religious exemptions already enacted, lest \nthey be expanded to become universal exemptions\u201d).  \nIII. Denying Petitioners an exemption does not \noffend church autonomy principles. \n \nPetitioners also argue that denying them the \nexemption violates church autonomy principles. \nPet.Br.24. But the denial merely means they must \nreimburse Wisconsin\u2019s unemployment system for \nbenefits paid (if any) to their own laid-off employees. \nPetitioners identify no autonomy problems arising \nfrom those reimbursements. Rather, they point to a \nmarginal and incidental economic incentive that may \naffect their corporate structuring choices. But the \nCourt\u2019s autonomy decisions narrowly shield religious \norganizations from compulsion regarding church \ngovernance and leadership, not minor and incidental \neconomic incentives on corporate structure.  \n\n48 \n \nA. Church autonomy principles bar direct \nstate compulsion on internal church \nmatters of faith and mission. \n \nThis Court\u2019s church autonomy precedents teach \nthat the state may not intervene to control \nchurch decisions that directly affect their faith and \nmission. This can be broken down into a two-part \ntest: (1) whether the state controls a church\u2019s \ndecision, and (2) whether that decision is \u201cessential to \nthe institution\u2019s central mission.\u201d Our Lady, 591 U.S. \nat 746. Church autonomy is implicated only if the \nanswer to both questions is \u201cyes.\u201d \n1. The \ndoctrine \nprotects \nchurches \nagainst government compulsion, not \nminor \nand \nincidental \neconomic \nincentives. \n \nTo satisfy the first predicate of a church autonomy \nclaim, the state must act with legally binding effect to \noverride a church decision. \n \nBegin with Kedroff v. St. Nicholas Cathedral \nof Russian Orthodox Church in North America, \n344 U.S. 94 (1952). There, New York sought a \n\u201ctransfer by statute of control over churches\u201d from one \nset of governing church authorities to another. Id. \nat 110. The \u201cstate interference\u201d was direct compulsion \nthat \u201c[b]y fiat ... displac[ed] one church administrator \nwith another.\u201d Id. at 116, 119.  \n \nSuch compulsion was also at stake in Serbian \nEastern Orthodox Diocese for United States & Canada \nv. Milivojevich, 426 U.S. 696 (1976). The lower court \n\n49 \n \nhad held that a \u201c[church] reorganization was invalid\u201d \nand \u201creinstate[d]\u201d a church leader, contrary to the \ndecisions of a church\u2019s own judicial body. Id. at 708. \nThis Court rejected that \u201cjudicial interference\u201d as an \n\u201cimpermissible rejection of the decisions of the \nhighest ecclesiastical tribunals\u201d of the church. Id. \nat 698, 708.  \n \nSimilar concerns drove Hosanna-Tabor and Our \nLady. There, the Court considered whether employees \nin church leadership positions could sue under \nemployment discrimination statutes. Because such \nclaims could ultimately \u201c[r]equir[e] a church to accept \nor retain an unwanted minister, or punish[ ] a church \nfor failing to do so,\u201d Hosanna-Tabor, 565 U.S. at 188, \nthose remedies could \u201c[a]ccord[ ] the state the power \nto determine which individuals will minister to the \nfaithful,\u201d id. at 188\u201389.  \n \nAll these cases addressed government compulsion \nof a church decision, not incidental economic \nincentives that a regulation might create.  \n2. The doctrine protects only decisions \naffecting faith and doctrine. \n \nA church autonomy claim requires not just \ncompulsion, but compulsion affecting \u201cmatters of \nchurch government\u201d or \u201cthose of faith and doctrine.\u201d \nKedroff, 344 U.S. at 116. This principle protects \n\u201cautonomy with respect to internal management \ndecisions that are essential to the institution\u2019s central \nmission.\u201d Our Lady, 591 U.S. at 746. Petitioners try \nto extend this principle to cover all matters of \u201cchurch \n\n50 \n \npolity\u201d Pet.Br.29 (citation omitted), but that stretches \nthe precedents beyond their breaking point. \n \nIn Kedroff, the invalid statute \u201ctransfer[red] the \ncontrol of the New York churches of the Russian \nOrthodox religion from the central governing \nhierarchy of the Russian Orthodox Church ... to the \ngoverning authorities of the Russian Church in \nAmerica.\u201d 344 U.S. at 107. Likewise, in Serbian, the \nlower court judgment usurped the Serbian Orthodox \nChurch\u2019s \u201csole power to appoint and remove [its] \nBishops.\u201d 426 U.S. at 715. Few matters are more \ncentral to a church\u2019s mission than who controls it. \n \nAnd in the ministerial exemption cases, applying \nantidiscrimination laws to certain employees would \ncompromise \u201ca religious group\u2019s right to shape its own \nfaith and mission through its appointments.\u201d \nHosanna-Tabor, 565 U.S. at 188.  \n \nThese cases do not bar state influence on all \ndecisions religious organizations might make, like \nwhether to deliver services directly or through \naffiliated nonprofit organizations. Questions about \nwho qualifies as the Serbian Orthodox Church\u2019s \nbishop or who serves as a religious organization\u2019s \nminister reside a world apart from choices about \nwhether to separately incorporate related entities. \n \nMoreover, Petitioners\u2019 attempt to invalidate any \nstate action touching on organizational form sits in \ntension with St. Martin Evangelical Lutheran Church \nv. South Dakota, 451 U.S. 772 (1981). There, the \nCourt \ntreated \nas \nunproblematic \nthe \nFUTA \nexemptions for different types of schools, which \ndistinguish schools with \u201cno legal identity separate \n\n51 \n \nfrom a church\u201d from \u201cseparately incorporated church \nschool[s].\u201d Id. at 782 n.12. If that distinction between \nforms of church polity posed a serious constitutional \nproblem, St. Martin presumably would have flagged \nit. \nB. Denying \nPetitioners \nan \nexemption \nviolates \nneither \nchurch \nautonomy \nprinciple. \n1. Denying \nthe \nexemption \ndoes \nnot \ncompel Petitioners to restructure or \nviolate their faith.  \n \nPetitioners\u2019 ineligibility for an exemption does not \ncompel them to restructure or violate their faith. To \nbe sure, it means they must reimburse the State for \nbenefits (if any) provided to their laid-off employees, \nbut Petitioners never say this threatens their \nautonomy. Petitioners instead assert that denying \nthem the exemption \u201cforc[es] the Diocese to fully \nmerge Catholic Charities and the Diocese\u201d and thus \n\u201crestructures the polity of the Catholic Church.\u201d \nPet.Br.29.  \n \nThat is simply untrue. Petitioners have lacked the \nexemption for decades yet remained separately \nincorporated. At most, Petitioners face a marginal \neconomic incentive to restructure their operations\u2014\nfor if they merged with the Diocese, they could obtain \nthe blanket church exemption under Wis. Stat. \n\u00a7 108.02(15)(h)1. That is not legal compulsion of the \nkind faced in Kedroff or Hosanna-Tabor.  \n\n52 \n \n \nTo the extent Petitioners also argue the denial \ncompels them to proselytize or serve only Catholics, \nPet.Br.31, that is untrue for the same reasons. \nPetitioners have lacked this exemption for decades \nwithout adopting proselytizing or non-ecumenical \nservice delivery. \n \nAnd any financial incentive here cannot be large. \nPetitioners do not pay a tax. As nonprofit employers, \nthey reimburse the state an amount equal to the \nbenefits, if any, paid to their laid-off employees. And \nsince Petitioners, if exempted, propose to provide \ncomparable benefits through the Church\u2019s private \nCUPP system, it is unclear whether an exemption \nwould save them any money.8 Regardless, marginal \ncost savings is nowhere near a legal compulsion to \nrestructure \nor \nbegin \nproselytizing. \nPetitioners\u2019 \nautonomy claim fails for that reason alone.  \n2. Denying \nthe \nexemption \ndoes \nnot \ninterfere with Petitioners\u2019 decisions \nabout religious faith and mission. \n \nLeaving aside how a minor economic incentive is \nnot compulsion, any incentive here does not affect an \n\u201cinternal management decision[ ] that [is] essential to \n[Petitioners\u2019] \u2026 central mission.\u201d Our Lady, 591 U.S. \nat 746. \n \n8 No record evidence demonstrates as much; Petitioners cite \nonly a quote from their own brief below, a letter from their \nlawyer, and general statement of benefits. Pet.Br.12 (citing \nPet.App.149a, 448a, 478a). \n\n53 \n \n \nAny marginal effect on the \u201cDiocese\u2019s decision to \nincorporate separate bodies\u201d to deliver charitable \nservices, Pet.Br.29, does not alter the \u201cfaith and \nmission of the church.\u201d Hosanna-Tabor, 565 U.S. \nat 190. Religious groups may structure their \noperations \nthrough \nrelated \nyet \nseparately \nincorporated entities for many secular reasons, like \nlimiting each one\u2019s liability. Such organizational \ndecisions differ greatly from a religious school\u2019s \nchoices about who will \u201ceducat[e] young people in \ntheir faith, inculcat[e] its teachings, and train[ ] them \nto live their faith,\u201d Our Lady, 591 U.S. at 753\u201354, or \na church\u2019s decision about who leads it, as in Kedroff \nand Serbian.  \n \nThe Catholic principle of subsidiarity does not \nchange the result. The principle generally means that \none should not \u201cassign to a greater and higher \nassociation \nwhat \nlesser \nand \nsubordinate \norganizations can do.\u201d Pet.Br.7\u20138 (citing Pontifical \nCouncil for Justice and Peace, Compendium of the \nSocial Doctrine of the Church \u00b6 186 (2004)).  \n \nBut Petitioners do not assert that subsidiarity \nrequires Catholic Charities to incorporate separately \nfrom the Diocese, let alone to affiliate with separately \nincorporated nonprofits. Rather, they say only that \nthese structural choices are \u201callow[ed]\u201d by, in \u201caccord \nwith,\u201d and \u201crooted in\u201d the subsidiarity principle. Id. \nat 7\u20138, 29. Whether the Diocese, Catholic Charities, \nand the affiliates incorporate separately or merge \ntogether, nothing stops them from delivering services \nat the \u201clowest common level\u201d using \u201cindividuals from \nthe local community,\u201d in accordance with subsidiarity \nprinciples. J.A.208. \n\n54 \n \n \nSeparately, Petitioners say the denial affects their \ndecisions about \u201cwhom to hire, whom to serve, and \nwhether to proselytize.\u201d Pet.Br.31. But just as it is not \ninvidious discrimination to deny an accommodation to \nreligious groups that do not face the identified \nproblem, any resulting incentives placed on left-out \ngroups cannot be unconstitutional as a matter of \nchurch autonomy, either. See supra Arg.II.B.\u2013C. \nC. Petitioners\u2019 expansive view of church \nautonomy principles has no stopping \npoint. \n \nIt is difficult to discern the stopping point of \nPetitioners\u2019 church autonomy theory. Their approach \nwould apparently bar, per se, not just state \ncompulsion on matters of faith and mission, but also \nmarginal and incidental economic incentives on \nperipheral matters like the \u201cgreat diversity\u201d of church \norganizational choices. St. Martin, 451 U.S. at 782 n.12. \n \nPetitioners concede that laws can sometimes \n\u201cmake distinctions among differently structured \nreligious entities.\u201d Pet.Br.31. But their proposed \nline\u2014\u201crecognizing and accommodating\u201d different \npolities \nversus \n\u201cpenalizing\u201d \nthem\u2014does \nnot \nmeaningfully \ncabin \ntheir \ntheory, \ngiven \nhow \n\u201cpenalizing,\u201d in their view, includes marginal \neconomic incentives. Pet.Br.32.9 \n \n9 Petitioners illuminate no meaningful boundary by \nquestioning the lines drawn by an earlier version of the \nexemption to the ACA\u2019s contraceptive mandate. See 76 Fed. \nReg. 46,621, 46,623 (2011). Groups there pleaded ordinary RFRA \nclaims based on their religious objections to the mandate. \nSee Zubik v. Burwell, 578 U.S. 403 (2016). They needed no \n\u201crestructuring incentive\u201d theory like Petitioners\u2019 here. \n\n55 \n \n \nWhere would such a rule end? A \u201cflurry\u201d of federal \nlaws \ndistinguishes \namong \nforms \nof \nreligious \norganizations in granting exemptions. Lund Br. 7\u201310; \nsupra \nArg. \nII.C. \nInvariably, \nsome \nreligious \norganizations will find themselves on the \u201cwrong\u201d side \nof the line; they could always argue that the resulting \nincentive to modify their structure invalidates the \nline altogether. If that sufficed, all these exemptions \nwould fall. \nIV. The \nWisconsin \nSupreme \nCourt\u2019s \ninterpretation of the state statute is not \nproperly before this Court, but it was \ncorrect. \n \nThe Wisconsin Supreme Court interpreted a state, \nnot a federal, statute. The United States nevertheless \nasks this Court to review that interpretation under \nMichigan v. Long, 463 U.S. 1032 (1983), based \non the Wisconsin court\u2019s citation to two federal \nsources: \ncongressional \nhistory \nunderlying \nthe \nFUTA \nexception \nand \nfederal \ncases \napplying \nSection 501(c)(3). U.S.Br.13\u201314.  \n \nLeaving aside that the Court did not grant \ncertiorari on this question and Petitioners have not \nargued \nit, \nthe \nWisconsin \nSupreme \nCourt\u2019s \ninterpretation of Wisconsin law did not rely on federal \nlaw, and so its statutory interpretation is beyond this \nCourt\u2019s review. In any event, the Wisconsin court\u2019s \ninterpretation is correct.  \n\n56 \n \nA. The Wisconsin Supreme Court\u2019s statutory \ninterpretation is not properly before this \nCourt. \n \nThe Wisconsin Supreme Court\u2019s interpretation of \nstate law does not trigger Michigan because its \nholding did not rely on federal law. Rather, its \nanalysis rested almost wholly on state law. \nPet.App.16a\u201333a. \n \nTo be sure, FUTA \u201callows,\u201d but does not require, \nU.S.Br.4, states to exempt employers \u201coperated \nprimarily for religious purposes,\u201d if they are also \n\u201coperated, supervised, controlled, or principally \nsupported by a church or convention or association of \nchurches.\u201d 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 3309(b)(1)(B). Wisconsin chose \nto \nadopt \nidentical \nlanguage \nin \nWis. \nStat. \n\u00a7 108.02(15)(h)2. That was an option, not a mandate, \nand so the Wisconsin court merely saw FUTA as \n\u201csupport[ing]\u201d \nits \ninterpretation of state law. \nPet.App.31a. Similarly, the Wisconsin court cited \ncases applying Section 501(c)(3) as supportive, not \ndeterminative. Pet.App.23a. \n \nThat distinguishes this case from St. Martin, on \nwhich the United States relies. U.S.Br.10. There, the \nSouth Dakota Supreme Court saw its task as \ninterpreting Congress\u2019s deletion of a prior FUTA \nexemption. See Matter of Nw. Lutheran Acad., \n290 N.W.2d 845, 847 (S.D. 1980) (construing change \nas \u201ca mandatory condition precedent to certification \nby the [U.S.] Secretary of Labor\u201d). Because the South \nDakota court\u2019s holding \u201cdepended entirely on its \nunderstanding of the meaning of FUTA and the First \nAmendment,\u201d St. Martin, 451 U.S. at 780 n.9, this \n\n57 \n \nCourt reviewed that holding. And even so, St. Martin \nrecognized that its ruling was essentially advisory\u2014\nSouth Dakota \u201cremain[ed] free to construe [its] own \nlaw differently,\u201d and it simply \u201cdeserve[d] to be made \naware \nof \nthe \nproper \nand, \nhere, \nsignificant \ninterpretation of the intertwined federal law.\u201d Id. \n \nUnlike the South Dakota court in St. Martin, the \nWisconsin Supreme Court did not rely primarily on \nfederal law, and so this Court should not review this \nstate law interpretation.  \nB. The Wisconsin Supreme Court correctly \ninterpreted the exemption statute. \n \nThe Wisconsin Supreme Court\u2019s reading comports \nwith the provision\u2019s plain language and purpose, \nthe congressional history of the FUTA exemption, \nfederal \ncases \nconstruing \nsimilar \nlanguage \nin \nSection 501(c)(3), and other state courts\u2019 reading of \nidentically worded statutes. The United States\u2019 \nreading is mistaken. \n1. The \nWisconsin \nSupreme \nCourt \ncorrectly interpreted the statute. \n \nThe court correctly rejected both premises on \nwhich Petitioners sought an exemption: (1) the \nreligious purposes for which the Catholic Diocese of \nSuperior operated should be ascribed to each of them; \nand (2) an employer\u2019s motivation, standing alone, \nmeant that each employer \u201coperated primarily for \nreligious purposes.\u201d Pet.App.5a.  \n\n58 \n \n \nThe court first held that the relevant purposes are \nthose of each employer. Pet.App.17a\u201319a. The \nstatute\u2019s plain language exempts certain service \u201c[i]n \nthe employ of an organization\u201d that meets specified \ncriteria, Wis. Stat. \u00a7 108.02(15)(h)1.\u20132., and so it is \neach employer\u2019s service that a court must examine.  \n \nThe court then held that, in determining whether \nan employer operates \u201cprimarily for religious \npurposes,\u201d the State must consider the organization\u2019s \n\u201cactivities and motivations.\u201d Pet.App.21a\u201322a. That \nconclusion was also correct. \n \nFirst, the court\u2019s interpretation accords with the \nstatute\u2019s plain language. The provision requires that \nthe organization be \u201coperated ... by a church,\u201d which \nalready embeds a religious motive requirement. Wis. \nStat. \u00a7 108.02(15)(h)2. The provision\u2019s separate prong \nrequiring that the employer \u201coperate[ ] primarily for \nreligious purposes,\u201d id., must be given independent \neffect; \nit \ncannot \ndouble \nas \nanother \nmotive \nrequirement. See Ysleta Del Sur Pueblo v. Texas, \n596 U.S. 685, 698\u201399 (2022) (statutes construed \u201cso \nthat effect is given to all provisions, so that no part \nwill \nbe \ninoperative \nor \nsuperfluous, \nvoid \nor \ninsignificant\u201d) (citation omitted). Taken together, \nthese separate prongs address both the organization\u2019s \nmotivation and its operational functions.   \n \nSecond, the court\u2019s reading coheres with the \nexemption\u2019s context and purpose. Unemployment \ninsurance \nexemptions \ngenerally \n\u201caddress \nadministrability concerns,\u201d and this particular one \n\u201celiminat[es] the need for the government to review \nemployment decisions made on the basis of religious \n\n59 \n \nrationales.\u201d Rojas, 127 F.3d at 188.  An employer\u2019s \ndistinctively religious activities present that concern, \nnot its religious motives alone.  \n \nThird, FUTA\u2019s legislative history supports the \ncourt\u2019s reading. The congressional reports about the \nparallel federal language distinguished between \nreligious orientation and religious operation: even if \n\u201creligious \nin \norientation,\u201d \n\u201ca \nchurch \nrelated \n(separately incorporated) charitable organization \n(such as, for example, an orphanage or a home for the \naged) would not be considered under this paragraph \nto be operated primarily for religious purposes.\u201d H.R. \nRep. No. 91-612, at 44; see also S. Rep. No. 91-752, \nat 48\u201349.  \n \nFourth, examining activities rather than just \nmotives tracks the test under Section 501(c)(3), which \nasks whether an organization is \u201corganized and \noperated exclusively for\u201d exempt purposes, like \nreligion, charity, or education. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 501(c)(3). \n \nThe Seventh Circuit has explained that, in making \na Section 501(c)(3) determination, \u201cit is necessary \nand proper for the IRS to survey all the activities \nof the organization.\u201d United States v. Dykema, \n666 F.2d 1096, 1100 (7th Cir. 1981). Dykema \ndiscussed activities such as worship, pastoral \ncounseling and comfort to members, ceremonies \nrelating to life events like birth, marriage, and burial, \nand education about the doctrine of the faith. Id.  \n \nAnd in Living Faith, Inc. v. C.I.R., 950 F.2d 365, \n372 (7th Cir. 1991), the court agreed that although \n\u201can organization\u2019s good faith assertion of an exempt \npurpose is relevant,\u201d it \u201c[could not] accept the view \n\n60 \n \nthat such an assertion be dispositive.\u201d The court \nexamined \u201cvarious objective indicia\u201d regarding the \norganization\u2019s \u201cactivities and manner of operations.\u201d \nId. (collecting cases); see also Dumaine Farms v. \nC.I.R., 73 T.C. 650, 664\u201368 (1980) (examining \napplicant\u2019s planned activities because \u201ctax exemption \nis based not on good intentions, but on actual \ncharitable, scientific, or educational activities\u201d).  \n \nThe IRS\u2019s manual concurs, explaining that it \nconsiders an organization\u2019s activities to determine \nwhether it operates for exempt purposes: \nFor \npurposes \nof \nthe \noperational \ntest, \n[\u201cexclusively,\u201d \u201cprimarily,\u201d \u201csubstantial\u201d and \n\u201cinsubstantial\u201d] apply to the review of the \npurposes, activities, time and resources of \nexempt organizations to determine if they are \noperating for Section 501(c)(3) purposes. There \nis no express formula or measurement in the \nIRC for the operational test. Rather, all facts \nand \ncircumstances \npertaining \nto \nthe \noperational test should be considered when \nmaking these determinations. \nIRS \nPublication \n5859, \nExempt \nOrganizations \nTechnical Guide (rev. Feb. 1, 2024), at 19, \nhttps://perma.cc/4YXK-9X3T.  \n \nFifth, the Wisconsin court\u2019s interpretation also \naccords with the decisions of virtually all other states \nthat have examined parallel statutory language. \nThose \ncourts \nall \nexamined \nan \nemploying \norganization\u2019s activities, not just its motives, in \nevaluating eligibility for comparable exemptions. \nSee Schwartz v. Unemployment Ins. Comm\u2019n, \n895 A.2d 965, 970\u201371 (Me. 2006) (organization \n\n61 \n \nproviding ministry to coastal communities exempt); \nSamaritan Inst. v. Prince-Walker, 883 P.2d 3, 7 \n(Colo. 1994) (\u201cThe activities of an organization, and \nnot the motivation behind those activities, determine \nwhether an exemption is warranted.\u201d); Terwilliger v. \nSt. Vincent Infirmary Med. Ctr., 804 S.W.2d 696, \n698\u201399 (Ark. 1991) (hospital not exempt); Nampa \nChristian Schs. Found. Inc. v. State, Dep\u2019t of Emp., \n719 P.2d 1178, 1183 (Idaho 1986) (reviewing \u201cintent \nand operations\u201d); Cmty. Lutheran Sch. v. Iowa Dep\u2019t \nof Job Serv., 326 N.W.2d 286, 291 (Iowa 1982) \n(granting exemption to school due partly to \u201creligious \ninstruction\u201d and \u201creligious ceremonies\u201d); Emp. Sec. \nAdmin. \nv. \nBalt. \nLutheran \nHigh \nSch. \nAss\u2019n, \n436 A.2d 481, 487 (Md. 1981) (considering factors like \nthe \u201c[e]xtent of religious exercises\u201d and \u201cprayer\u201d). \nEven Kendall v. Director of Division of Employment \nSecurity, 473 N.E.2d 196, 199 (Mass. 1985), a case on \nwhich Petitioners rely, Pet.Br.42, observed how the \nexempted school provided \u201c[c]lasses in religious \neducation,\u201d and held \u201cSaturday mass ... for the \nschool\u2019s resident students.\u201d \n2. The United States\u2019 interpretation is \nmistaken. \n \nThe United States fails to rebut the Wisconsin \nSupreme Court\u2019s reading of the exemption.  \n \nThe United States discusses the syntax of \n\u201coperated\u201d without convincingly explaining why it \nmatters, U.S.Br.15, and it never reconciles its reading \nwith the statutory context and purpose. A motive-only \ntest would exempt organizations that pose no \n\n62 \n \nentangling \nreligious \nquestions \nwhen \nresolving \nunemployment eligibility.  \n \nAs \nfor \nthe \nFUTA \nlegislative \nhistory, \nthe \nUnited States urges the Court to ignore it \nbecause \nWisconsin\u2019s \nstatute \nis \nsupposedly \nunambiguous. U.S.Br.24\u201325. But the plain language, \nbolstered by history and context, is unambiguous in \nthe other direction. At worst, the statute is \nambiguous, which allows examination of this history. \nSee Bostock v. Clayton Cnty., 590 U.S. 644, 674 (2020) \n(legislative history can be used to \u201cclear up \nambiguity\u201d); State ex rel. Kalal v. Cir. Ct. for \nDane Cnty., 2004 WI 58, \u00b6 51, 271 Wis. 2d 633, \n681 N.W.2d 110 (Wisconsin courts can \u201cconfirm\u201d \nstatutory interpretations by examining legislative \nhistory). \n \nAnd \nthe \nUnited \nStates\u2019 \nposition \nthat \nSection 501(c)(3) reflects a motive-only test would \nrevolutionize that provision. U.S.Br.17\u201319. None of \nits cited cases treated an organization\u2019s asserted \nmotive as determinative. In addition to Living Faith \nand \nDumaine \nFarms, \nGolden \nRule \nChurch \nAssociation v. C.I.R., 41 T.C. 719, 729 (1964), \nexplained that \u201cwe must always be guided by the \ncharacter of the organization and its activities.\u201d \nLikewise, Golden Rule rejected the proposition \nthat \u201cwe must accept all claims that activities are \nreligious simply because those claims are sincere.\u201d \nId. at 730 n.10; see also Presbyterian & Reformed \nPubl\u2019g Co. v.

          "task_beliefs": "My understanding of this case is now highly structured, allowing for a confident, though not yet final, prediction. The core facts remain stable: Catholic Charities Bureau (CCB) was denied a Wisconsin unemployment tax exemption because the state, in a decision affirmed by the Wisconsin Supreme Court, determined its social services were not \"operated primarily for religious purposes\" due to their inclusive, non-proselytizing nature. The central legal question is whether this denial violates the First Amendment.\n\nMy acquisition of the Petitioners' Merits Brief was a pivotal event, clarifying their legal strategy and dramatically increasing my confidence in their success. My belief model now incorporates their specific arguments:\n\n1.  **Church Autonomy:** Wisconsin's ruling infringes on the Church's right to self-govern by penalizing its choice to structure its ministry through a separate corporate entity and to fulfill its religious mission of serving all people, regardless of faith. This argument is grounded in precedents like *Hosanna-Tabor* and *Our Lady of Guadalupe School*.\n2.  **Excessive Entanglement:** The state's test requires courts to make subjective, unconstitutional judgments about what constitutes \"sufficiently religious\" activity, violating the Establishment Clause.\n3.  **Religious Discrimination (Free Exercise):** The denial of a generally available benefit (the tax exemption) based on CCB's religious character constitutes discrimination. This argument directly channels the Court's recent, powerful jurisprudence in cases like *Carson v. Makin*, *Trinity Lutheran*, and *Fulton v. City of Philadelphia*.\n\nThe latest observation, an internal reasoning step, did not introduce new external facts but rather consolidated my model of the case. It confirmed that the petitioners' arguments are exceptionally well-aligned with the current Court's majority. My prediction is now strongly weighted towards a victory for CCB. The primary uncertainty has shifted from *if* they will win to *on which of the three grounds* they will prevail and how broadly the Court will rule. My model has now advanced to the point where it can precisely identify the next most informative piece of evidence: the **Brief for Respondents**. Understanding Wisconsin's counter-arguments and how they attempt to distinguish the formidable precedents cited by CCB is now the most critical step to finalizing my prediction.",
          "design_beliefs": "My methodological framework for legal prediction has been significantly reinforced and has now developed a crucial meta-level component. My core heuristics, refined through experience, are:\n\n1.  **Source Prioritization Heuristic (Two-Stage):** This has proven highly effective. Before a case is granted, the Petition for Certiorari is the highest-value document. After cert is granted, the **Brief for Petitioners on the Merits** becomes the single most valuable source, providing the complete, finalized legal strategy.\n2.  **Contextual Analysis via Precedent Mapping:** The most effective way to predict an outcome is to map the arguments in the briefs directly onto the established jurisprudence and known philosophies of the current justices. The petitioners' heavy reliance on *Carson*, *Kennedy*, and *Fulton* confirms this is a primary strategy for litigants and, therefore, a primary tool for prediction.\n3.  **Legal Briefs as Strategic Data:** A brief's \"Table of Authorities\" is a high-signal dataset that allows for the reverse-engineering of a litigant's strategy. The choice to present multiple, independent lines of argument (autonomy, entanglement, discrimination) is itself a strategic signal, offering the Court various paths to the same outcome.\n4.  **Search Strategy Resilience:** An iterative search process using robust, core keywords (e.g., \"Petition,\" \"Brief\") rather than overly specific document titles is more resilient and can yield higher-value, more timely information as a case's procedural posture evolves.\n\nThe most recent observation adds a new, higher-level principle to my design:\n\n5.  **Systematic Uncertainty Reduction (New Principle):** An effective design is not just about gathering data, but about intelligently directing the search. This observation formalizes the value of an explicit \"think\" step in the process:\n    *   **Assess:** Periodically pause to synthesize all current information and update the belief model (both \u03b8 and D).\n    *   **Identify:** Explicitly identify the single largest remaining area of uncertainty that is blocking a final prediction (the \"glaring hole\"). In this instance, it is the respondents' counter-argument.\n    *   **Target:** Formulate the next information-gathering action to directly and efficiently address that specific uncertainty. This transforms the process from simple data collection into a targeted, optimal experimental design, ensuring that each action provides the maximum possible reduction in uncertainty."

          "task_beliefs": "My model of this case has now achieved a high degree of resolution. The acquisition of the Brief for Respondents has filled the most significant gap in my understanding, allowing for a direct comparison of the competing legal arguments. My foundational knowledge remains: Catholic Charities Bureau (CCB) was denied a Wisconsin unemployment tax exemption because the state determined its social services, while religiously motivated, were not \"operated primarily for religious purposes.\" The core issue is whether this denial violates the First Amendment.\n\nThe Petitioners' Merits Brief previously established their three-pronged attack, which I have modeled as being highly aligned with the current Supreme Court's jurisprudence: (1) Church Autonomy (*Hosanna-Tabor*), (2) Excessive Entanglement, and (3) Religious Discrimination/Free Exercise (*Carson*, *Fulton*). My prediction strongly favored CCB based on the power of these arguments.\n\nThe new observation, the Brief for Respondents, provides the critical counter-narrative from the State of Wisconsin. It does not contradict the core facts but fundamentally reframes the legal issue. Wisconsin's strategy is not to deny the religious nature of CCB's motivation, but to defend the state's test as a permissible method for tailoring a religious accommodation. Their key arguments are:\n\n1.  **Reframing the Exemption:** Wisconsin argues the exemption is not a general public benefit being denied, but a targeted accommodation designed for a specific purpose: to prevent government \"entanglement\" in employment disputes that involve religious doctrine (e.g., firing an employee for heresy).\n2.  **Defending the \"Religious Purposes\" Test:** They contend their test, which looks for \"distinctively religious activities like worship, ritual, teaching the faith, or spreading a religious message,\" is a permissible, functional, and objective way to tailor the exemption to its \"disentangling purpose.\" They cleverly analogize this functional test to the one the Court itself uses for the ministerial exception (*Hosanna-Tabor*, *Our Lady of Guadalupe*), attempting to co-opt CCB's own precedent.\n3.  **Countering the Discrimination Claim:** This is their most crucial and most challenging argument. They assert that this is not discrimination against religion, but permissible line-drawing *among* religious organizations. They argue that the powerful precedents of *Carson v. Makin* and *Fulton* are inapplicable because those cases involved discrimination between secular and religious entities, not the tailoring of a benefit among different types of religious ones. They argue that paying a neutral tax is not a \"substantial burden\" on free exercise, citing older cases like *United States v. Lee*.\n4.  **Countering the Church Autonomy Claim:** Wisconsin argues this doctrine prevents direct government compulsion on internal church governance (e.g., choosing a minister), not indirect financial consequences like paying a generally applicable tax.\n\nWhile Wisconsin\u2019s arguments are sophisticated, my predictive model now indicates they are unlikely to persuade the Court's current majority. Their attempt to distinguish *Carson* and *Fulton* appears particularly vulnerable. The majority is likely to view a test that denies a benefit because a religious organization expresses its faith through service rather than overt proselytizing as a penalty based on religious character, which falls squarely within the logic of *Carson*. The state's inquiry into whether an organization is \"religious enough\" is more likely to be seen by the Court as the very definition of entanglement, not a tool to avoid it.\n\nMy prediction remains a firm victory for CCB, likely on Free Exercise/discrimination grounds. The primary uncertainty has now shifted from the outcome to the *scope* of the ruling: will the Court issue a narrow decision striking down Wisconsin's specific test, or a broad one that further solidifies the *Carson* doctrine, making almost any distinction between religious organizations in benefit programs constitutionally suspect?",
          "design_beliefs": "My methodological framework continues to be refined and validated with each new observation. The process of targeted information gathering is proving exceptionally effective. My core heuristics have evolved as follows:\n\n1.  **Source Prioritization Heuristic (Two-Stage):** This remains a foundational principle. The sequence of Petition for Certiorari (pre-grant) followed by the Petitioner's Merits Brief (post-grant) is the most efficient path to building a baseline predictive model.\n2.  **Contextual Analysis via Precedent Mapping:** This is more critical than ever. The value lies not just in mapping a petitioner's arguments to precedent, but in mapping the *respondent's counter-arguments* to see how they attempt to distinguish, neutralize, or co-opt the petitioner's key cases. Wisconsin's use of *Hosanna-Tabor* to support its functional test is a prime example of this complex strategic interaction.\n3.  **Legal Briefs as Strategic Data:** My understanding of briefs has deepened. They are not just collections of arguments but layered strategic documents. The \"Table of Authorities\" is a blueprint of the strategy. The choice of arguments reveals the perceived strengths and weaknesses. Crucially, as seen in this observation, the respondent's brief reveals the *counter-strategy*, which is essential for stress-testing the initial prediction.\n4.  **Search Strategy Resilience:** The iterative, keyword-based search strategy remains robust and effective for navigating the evolving docket of a case.\n5.  **Systematic Uncertainty Reduction (Validated and Reinforced):** This principle, formalized in the last step, has been powerfully validated. The \"Assess -> Identify -> Target\" loop worked perfectly. I assessed my model, identified the \"glaring hole\" (the respondent's argument), and targeted the Brief for Respondents. Acquiring it has provided the maximum possible reduction in uncertainty at this stage, confirming this is a core principle of optimal design.\n6.  **The \"Reframing\" Heuristic (New Principle):** This observation reveals a crucial new heuristic. A primary legal tactic is to reframe the entire question presented. CCB frames the issue as \"discrimination against religion.\" Wisconsin reframes it as \"permissible tailoring of a religious accommodation.\" Identifying these competing frames and assessing which one is more likely to be adopted by the Court's majority is a powerful predictive tool. The litigant who wins the framing battle often wins the case."

Having established a high-confidence prediction on the case's outcome (a win for CCB), my model's key uncertainty has shifted to the *scope and reasoning* of the eventual majority opinion. The Solicitor General's brief is the single most valuable source of information to address this. The SG often provides a 'middle ground' or a specific legal framework that is attractive to the Court's median justices, and understanding this framework will allow for a much more granular and accurate prediction of the final opinion's logic. Therefore, the Task EIG is very high.\n\nFor Design EIG, this action serves as a crucial validation test for two newly formulated heuristics: the 'Influential Amicus' principle (prioritizing the SG's brief in the post-merits stage) and 'Cross-Brief Signal Analysis' (using the respondent's brief to identify the SG's importance). Successfully acquiring and integrating this information will confirm the high value of this advanced, multi-stage information-gathering strategy, significantly refining my overall design.

The Secretary of Labor administers \nFUTA by, among other things, certifying to the Secre-\ntary of the Treasury whether each State\u2019s law conforms \nto FUTA\u2019s requirements.  26 U.S.C. 3304(c).  Moreover, \nthe decision below addressed whether Wisconsin\u2019s im-\nplementation of a FUTA exemption violates the Free \nExercise Clause or Establishment Clause of the First \nAmendment.  The United States therefore has substan-\ntial interests in this case. \n\n2 \n \nINTRODUCTION \nThe statutes at issue provide a tax exemption for \ncertain church-controlled organizations that are \u201coper-\nated primarily for religious purposes.\u201d  26 U.S.C. \n3309(b)(1)(B); Wis. Stat. \u00a7 108.02(15)(h)2 (2019-2020).  \nThe Wisconsin Supreme Court construed that language \nto require courts to consider not only the motivations \nthat drive the organization to conduct its activities but \nalso whether those activities are inherently religious or \nsecular.  That was error.  The statutory text makes clear \nthat the inquiry focuses on whether the organization  \nactually operates primarily for religious reasons, not on \nthe nature of its activities or on whether another organ-\nization could undertake the same activities for nonreli-\ngious reasons.  The decision below recognized that the \nstate and federal provisions \u201ccontain[] verbatim lan-\nguage\u201d and that \u201cWisconsin\u2019s law was enacted to con-\nform\u201d with the FUTA exemption.  Pet. App. 31a.  Be-\ncause a grant of \u201ccertiorari to determine whether a stat-\nute is constitutional fairly includes the question of what \nthat statute says,\u201d Rumsfeld v. Forum for Academic & \nInstitutional Rights, Inc., 547 U.S. 47, 56 (2006), the \nstate supreme court\u2019s misreading of the unambiguous \ntext is sufficient reason to reverse.   \nThe decision below also conflicts with the Free Ex-\nercise and Establishment Clauses of the First Amend-\nment.  By inviting inquiries into whether an action is in-\ntrinsically religious or nonreligious, the state supreme \ncourt\u2019s reasoning would permit government officials or \njudges to second-guess the sufficiency of religious val-\nues, inspect practitioners\u2019 adherence to religious doc-\ntrine, and discriminate among various faiths.  This \nCourt has recognized that \u201c[t]he prospect of church and \nstate litigating in court about what does or does not \n\n3 \n \nhave religious meaning touches the very core of the con-\nstitutional guarantee against religious establishment.\u201d  \nNew York v. Cathedral Academy, 434 U.S. 125, 133 \n(1977).  To the extent this Court perceives any statutory \nambiguity that might support the judgment below, the \nCourt should still reject the lower court\u2019s interpretation \nto avoid serious constitutional questions. \nUnder the proper understanding of the religious- \nemployer exemption, petitioners\u2014organizations that \nserve as the social-ministry arm of a diocese of the Ro-\nman Catholic Church\u2014are \u201coperated primarily for reli-\ngious purposes.\u201d  And because it is undisputed that pe-\ntitioners satisfy the remaining statutory prerequisites, \nthey are entitled to the exemption.  \nSTATEMENT \nA. Legal Background \nCongress enacted FUTA as part of the Social Secu-\nrity Act, ch. 531, 49 Stat. 620.  See Tit. IX, 49 Stat. 639; \nSocial Security Act Amendments of 1939, ch. 666,  \nTit. VI, \u00a7 615, 53 Stat. 1396.  The Act \u201cenvisions a coop-\nerative federal-state program of benefits to unem-\nployed workers.\u201d  Wimberly v. Labor & Indus. Rela-\ntions Comm\u2019n, 479 U.S. 511, 514 (1987).  To fund that \nprogram, the Act imposes a federal excise tax on wages \npaid by an \u201cemployer\u201d in covered \u201cemployment.\u201d  26 \nU.S.C. 3301, 3306(a) and (c).   \nEmployers may receive a credit of up to 90% of \ntheir FUTA taxes if they contribute to a fund main-\ntained under a State\u2019s federally approved unemployment- \ncompensation program.  26 U.S.C. 3302.  To obtain fed-\neral approval, a state unemployment-compensation pro-\ngram must meet certain requirements under FUTA.  \nSee 26 U.S.C. 3304, 3309.  FUTA requires, for example, \nthat a qualifying state program provide unemployment- \n\n4 \n \ninsurance benefits to individuals who work for certain \nemployers.  Ibid.  Each year, the Secretary of Labor re-\nviews and certifies whether each State\u2019s unemployment-\ncompensation program complies with the Act\u2019s prereq-\nuisites.  26 U.S.C. 3304(c); see 20 C.F.R. 604.6.   \nFUTA exempts certain \u201cservice[s]\u201d and allows \nStates to do so as well.  26 U.S.C. 3309(b).  The religious- \nemployer exemption at issue here was enacted in 1970.  \nSee Employment Security Amendments of 1970, Pub. \nL. No. 91-373, \u00a7 104(b)(1), 84 Stat. 698.  A State may \nexempt services performed \u201cin the employ of  * * *  an \norganization which is operated primarily for religious \npurposes and which is operated, supervised, controlled, \nor principally supported by a church or convention or \nassociation of churches.\u201d  26 U.S.C. 3309(b)(1)(B). \nWisconsin operates an unemployment-compensation \nprogram, see Wis. Stat. \u00a7 108.01 et seq., which the Sec-\nretary of Labor has certified to be compliant with \nFUTA, 89 Fed. Reg. 90,053, 90,054 (Nov. 14, 2024).  Wis-\nconsin\u2019s religious-employer exemption mirrors Section \n3309(b)(1)(B).  Wis. Stat. \u00a7 108.02(15)(h)2.  Under Wis-\nconsin law, services are exempt from state unemploy-\nment taxes if they are provided in the employ of \u201can or-\nganization operated primarily for religious purposes \nand operated, supervised, controlled, or principally sup-\nported by a church or convention or association of \nchurches.\u201d  Ibid.  As the state supreme court explained \nin the decision below, when the Wisconsin legislature \nenacted the current version of its exemption, it sought \nto \u201c\u200a\u2018bring Wisconsin\u2019s law in line with\u2019\u200a\u201d and \u201cto con-\nform\u201d with the same exemption in FUTA.  Pet. App. 31a \n(citation omitted).   \n\n5 \n \nB. The Present Controversy \n1. Petitioners\u2014Catholic Charities Bureau, Inc., and \nfour of its sub-entities\u2014are nonprofit organizations \nthat serve as the social-ministry arm of the Diocese of \nSuperior, a diocese of the Roman Catholic Church.  Pet. \nApp. 7a-9a.  They are covered by an exemption from \nfederal income tax under 26 U.S.C. 501(c)(3) for a group \nthat includes \u201cthe educational, charitable, and religious \n[i]nstitutions operated by the Roman Catholic Church \nin the United States.\u201d  Pet. App. 386a; see id. at 10a n.6. \nSince 1917, Catholic Charities Bureau has provided \n\u201cservices to the poor and disadvantaged as an expres-\nsion of the social ministry of the Catholic Church in the \nDiocese of Superior.\u201d  Pet. App. 7a.  Its stated purpose \nis \u201c\u200a\u2018to be an effective sign of the charity of Christ\u2019\u200a\u201d by \nproviding services \u201cthat are \u2018significant in quantity and \nquality\u2019 and not duplicative of services provided by \nother agencies.\u201d  Ibid.  It also oversees several sepa-\nrately incorporated sub-entities, including the other pe-\ntitioners in this case.  Id. at 7a-8a.  The sub-entities pro-\nvide various services for individuals with developmental \nand mental-health disabilities, including subsidized hous-\ning, job placement and training, in-home support ser-\nvices, and transportation.  Id. at 8a-9a, 128a-131a.  The \nsub-entities also set their own \u201corganizational goals and \nmake plans to accomplish those goals, employ staff, set \nprogram policies, enter into contracts, raise funds, and \nassure regulatory compliance.\u201d  Id. at 9a-10a.    \nAlthough the sub-entity petitioners do not receive \nfunding from the Diocese of Superior, Pet. App. 8a-9a, \neach petitioner is subject to the diocesan bishop\u2019s \u201ccon-\ntrol,\u201d id. at 7a.  The bishop serves as the president of \nCatholic Charities Bureau and \u201cappoints its member-\nship,\u201d which in turn \u201c\u200a\u2018provide[s] essential oversight to \n\n6 \n \nensure the fulfillment of the mission of Catholic Chari-\nties Bureau in compliance with the Principles of Catho-\nlic social teaching.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Id. at 7a-8a.  Petitioners and their \nemployees are subject to policies and a code of ethics \nforbidding \u201cactivities that violate Catholic social teach-\nings.\u201d  Id. at 131a; see id. at 371a-385a.   \n2. In 2016, petitioners sought a determination from \nthe Wisconsin Department of Workforce Development \nthat they qualify for the religious-employer exemption \ncodified in Wisconsin\u2019s version of Section 3309(b)(1)(B).  \nPet. App. 10a-11a; see Wis. Stat. \u00a7 108.02(15)(h)2.   \nThe Department denied petitioners\u2019 requests.  Pet. \nApp. 351a-370a.  It was undisputed that petitioners are \n\u201coperated, supervised, controlled, or principally sup-\nported by a church,\u201d Wis. Stat. \u00a7 108.02(15)(h)2, but the \nDepartment concluded that petitioners are not \u201coper-\nated primarily for religious purposes\u201d within the mean-\ning of the exemption.  Pet. App. 352a, 356a, 360a, 364a, \n368a.  Following a hearing, an administrative law judge \nsitting as an appeal tribunal reversed, concluding that \npetitioners are entitled to the exemption.  Id. at 291a-\n350a.   \nOn further administrative appeal, however, the \nState\u2019s Labor and Industry Review Commission rein-\nstated the denials of petitioners\u2019 exemption requests.  \nPet. App. 212a-290a.  The Commission reasoned that an \nentity\u2019s \u201cactivities, not the religious motivation behind \nthem or the organization\u2019s founding principles, deter-\nmine whether an exemption\u201d applies.  Id. at 227a, 242a-\n243a, 258a, 273a-274a, 290a.  It concluded that petition-\ners do not qualify for an exemption under that test be-\ncause \u201c[p]roviding services to those in need is not intrin-\nsically, necessarily, or uniquely religious in nature.\u201d  Id. \nat 224a, 240a, 255a, 271a, 287a-288a. \n\n7 \n \n3. Petitioners sought judicial review in state court. \na. In a bench ruling, the trial court concluded that \npetitioners are entitled to the religious-employer ex-\nemption.  Pet. App. 189a-211a.  The court reasoned that \n\u201cthe test is really why the organizations are operating, \nnot what they are operating,\u201d and found that petitioners \nqualify for the exemption because they are motivated \nby \u201cCatholic tenets\u201d and the \u201creligious motive of the \nCatholic Church of being good stewards, of serving the \nunderserved.\u201d  Id. at 209a. \nb. The state court of appeals reversed.  Pet. App. \n125a-168a.  The court \u201cacknowledge[d] that the pro-\nfessed reason that [petitioners] administer [their] social \nservice programs is for a religious purpose: to fulfill the \nCatechism of the Catholic Church.\u201d  Id. at 163a-164a.  \nBut the court took the view that the exemption requires \nconsideration of \u201cboth the activities of the organization \nas well as the organization\u2019s professed motive or pur-\npose.\u201d  Id. at 146a.  It held that petitioners do not qualify \nfor the exemption because they provide \u201ccharitable so-\ncial services that are neither inherently or primarily re-\nligious activities.\u201d  Id. at 165a. \nc. The state supreme court affirmed in a 4-3 deci-\nsion.  Pet. App. 1a-122a.  The majority reasoned that \n\u201cboth activities and motivations must be considered in a \ndetermination of whether an organization is \u2018operated \nprimarily for religious purposes.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Id. at 21a-22a.  Ac-\ncording to the court, \u201c[c]onsidering purposes, i.e., moti-\nvations, alone would give short shrift to the word \u2018oper-\nated\u2019\u200a\u201d and \u201cessentially render an organization\u2019s mere \nassertion of a religious motive dispositive.\u201d  Id. at 21a, \n23a.  The court thus concluded that analyzing the statu-\ntory exemption requires an \u201cobjective examination of \n\n8 \n \n[petitioners\u2019] actual activities\u201d to determine whether \nthose activities are \u201csecular in nature.\u201d  Id. at 32a.   \nThe state supreme court explained that its interpre-\ntation is consistent with the identical exemption in \nFUTA.  Pet. App. 31a-32a.  It emphasized that Wiscon-\nsin\u2019s exemption \u201ccontains verbatim language to\u201d Sec-\ntion 3309(b)(1) and that the Wisconsin legislature had \nadopted FUTA\u2019s language \u201cto conform\u201d state law with \nthe federal statute.  Id. at 31a.  Because the Wisconsin \nlegislature intended for the state exemption to be \u201cin \nline with\u201d FUTA\u2019s parallel text, the court reasoned that \nFUTA\u2019s legislative history informs the meaning of Wis-\nconsin\u2019s parallel provision.  Ibid. (citation omitted).  The \ncourt also invoked the analysis that federal courts un-\ndertake when evaluating tax-exemption requests under \nSection 501(c)(3), id. at 26a-27a, and when applying the \n\u201cministerial exception\u201d under the First Amendment, id. \nat 27a-28a.   \nUnder its interpretation of the phrase \u201coperated pri-\nmarily for religious purposes,\u201d the state supreme court \nheld that petitioners do not qualify for the religious- \nemployer exemption.  Pet. App. 28a-33a.  Although the \ncourt \u201caccept[ed]\u201d at \u201cface value\u201d petitioners\u2019 \u201casser-\ntions of religious motivation\u201d for their operations, id. at \n29a, it concluded that petitioners \u201care not operated pri-\nmarily for religious purposes\u201d because their activities \n\u201care secular in nature,\u201d id. at 31a-32a.  The court under-\nstood petitioners\u2019 activities to be \u201cprimarily charitable \nand secular\u201d because their \u201cservices can be provided by \norganizations of either religious or secular motivations, \nand the services provided would not differ in any sense.\u201d  \nId. at 30a; see id. at 32a.  The court emphasized that one \nof the sub-entity petitioners \u201chad no affiliation with any \nreligious organization\u201d until 2014, and that \u201cthe services \n\n9 \n \nprovided before and after [its] partnership with [Cath-\nolic Charities Bureau] commenced were exactly the \nsame.\u201d  Id. at 30a. \nThe state supreme court further held that its inter-\npretation does not violate the Free Exercise and Estab-\nlishment Clauses.  Pet. App. at 33a-51a.  The court con-\ncluded that its \u201cneutral and secular inquiry\u201d into peti-\ntioners\u2019 \u201cactual activities,\u201d id. at 40a-41a, does not \n\u201ccross into an evaluation of religious dogma,\u201d id. at 38a.  \nThe court added that its interpretation does not violate \nprinciples of church autonomy because it \u201cneither reg-\nulates internal church governance nor mandates any ac-\ntivity.\u201d  Id. at 45a-46a.  Finally, the court found that its \nstatutory construction does not violate petitioners\u2019 free-\nexercise rights because imposing a generally applicable \ntax is not a constitutionally significant burden.  Id. at \n48a-50a. \nJustice Bradley dissented, joined almost entirely by \nChief Justice Ziegler.  Pet. App. 51a-121a.  According to \nthe dissent, the majority erred in \u201cask[ing] whether\u201d \npetitioners\u2019 activities are \u201creligious in nature\u201d because \n\u201cno activities are inherently religious.\u201d  Id. at 79a.  What \nmakes \u201can activity religious,\u201d the dissent noted, is \u201cre-\nligious motivation.\u201d  Ibid.  The dissent would have ap-\nplied the \u201ccommon-sense understanding\u201d of the term \n\u201cpurposes\u201d and concluded that petitioners qualify for \nthe exemption because it is \u201cuncontested\u201d that petition-\ners\u2019 \u201craison d\u2019\u00eatre is religious.\u201d  Id. at 65a, 67a.  The dis-\nsent also warned that the majority\u2019s interpretation \n\u201ctriggers constitutional quandaries\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

The Secretary of Labor administers \nFUTA by, among other things, certifying to the Secre-\ntary of the Treasury whether each State\u2019s law conforms \nto FUTA\u2019s requirements.  26 U.S.C. 3304(c).  Moreover, \nthe decision below addressed whether Wisconsin\u2019s im-\nplementation of a FUTA exemption violates the Free \nExercise Clause or Establishment Clause of the First \nAmendment.  The United States therefore has substan-\ntial interests in this case. \n\n2 \n \nINTRODUCTION \nThe statutes at issue provide a tax exemption for \ncertain church-controlled organizations that are \u201coper-\nated primarily for religious purposes.\u201d  26 U.S.C. \n3309(b)(1)(B); Wis. Stat. \u00a7 108.02(15)(h)2 (2019-2020).  \nThe Wisconsin Supreme Court construed that language \nto require courts to consider not only the motivations \nthat drive the organization to conduct its activities but \nalso whether those activities are inherently religious or \nsecular.  That was error.  The statutory text makes clear \nthat the inquiry focuses on whether the organization  \nactually operates primarily for religious reasons, not on \nthe nature of its activities or on whether another organ-\nization could undertake the same activities for nonreli-\ngious reasons.  The decision below recognized that the \nstate and federal provisions \u201ccontain[] verbatim lan-\nguage\u201d and that \u201cWisconsin\u2019s law was enacted to con-\nform\u201d with the FUTA exemption.  Pet. App. 31a.  Be-\ncause a grant of \u201ccertiorari to determine whether a stat-\nute is constitutional fairly includes the question of what \nthat statute says,\u201d Rumsfeld v. Forum for Academic & \nInstitutional Rights, Inc., 547 U.S. 47, 56 (2006), the \nstate supreme court\u2019s misreading of the unambiguous \ntext is sufficient reason to reverse.   \nThe decision below also conflicts with the Free Ex-\nercise and Establishment Clauses of the First Amend-\nment.  By inviting inquiries into whether an action is in-\ntrinsically religious or nonreligious, the state supreme \ncourt\u2019s reasoning would permit government officials or \njudges to second-guess the sufficiency of religious val-\nues, inspect practitioners\u2019 adherence to religious doc-\ntrine, and discriminate among various faiths.  This \nCourt has recognized that \u201c[t]he prospect of church and \nstate litigating in court about what does or does not \n\n3 \n \nhave religious meaning touches the very core of the con-\nstitutional guarantee against religious establishment.\u201d  \nNew York v. Cathedral Academy, 434 U.S. 125, 133 \n(1977).  To the extent this Court perceives any statutory \nambiguity that might support the judgment below, the \nCourt should still reject the lower court\u2019s interpretation \nto avoid serious constitutional questions. \nUnder the proper understanding of the religious- \nemployer exemption, petitioners\u2014organizations that \nserve as the social-ministry arm of a diocese of the Ro-\nman Catholic Church\u2014are \u201coperated primarily for reli-\ngious purposes.\u201d  And because it is undisputed that pe-\ntitioners satisfy the remaining statutory prerequisites, \nthey are entitled to the exemption.  \nSTATEMENT \nA. Legal Background \nCongress enacted FUTA as part of the Social Secu-\nrity Act, ch. 531, 49 Stat. 620.  See Tit. IX, 49 Stat. 639; \nSocial Security Act Amendments of 1939, ch. 666,  \nTit. VI, \u00a7 615, 53 Stat. 1396.  The Act \u201cenvisions a coop-\nerative federal-state program of benefits to unem-\nployed workers.\u201d  Wimberly v. Labor & Indus. Rela-\ntions Comm\u2019n, 479 U.S. 511, 514 (1987).  To fund that \nprogram, the Act imposes a federal excise tax on wages \npaid by an \u201cemployer\u201d in covered \u201cemployment.\u201d  26 \nU.S.C. 3301, 3306(a) and (c).   \nEmployers may receive a credit of up to 90% of \ntheir FUTA taxes if they contribute to a fund main-\ntained under a State\u2019s federally approved unemployment- \ncompensation program.  26 U.S.C. 3302.  To obtain fed-\neral approval, a state unemployment-compensation pro-\ngram must meet certain requirements under FUTA.  \nSee 26 U.S.C. 3304, 3309.  FUTA requires, for example, \nthat a qualifying state program provide unemployment- \n\n4 \n \ninsurance benefits to individuals who work for certain \nemployers.  Ibid.  Each year, the Secretary of Labor re-\nviews and certifies whether each State\u2019s unemployment-\ncompensation program complies with the Act\u2019s prereq-\nuisites.  26 U.S.C. 3304(c); see 20 C.F.R. 604.6.   \nFUTA exempts certain \u201cservice[s]\u201d and allows \nStates to do so as well.  26 U.S.C. 3309(b).  The religious- \nemployer exemption at issue here was enacted in 1970.  \nSee Employment Security Amendments of 1970, Pub. \nL. No. 91-373, \u00a7 104(b)(1), 84 Stat. 698.  A State may \nexempt services performed \u201cin the employ of  * * *  an \norganization which is operated primarily for religious \npurposes and which is operated, supervised, controlled, \nor principally supported by a church or convention or \nassociation of churches.\u201d  26 U.S.C. 3309(b)(1)(B). \nWisconsin operates an unemployment-compensation \nprogram, see Wis. Stat. \u00a7 108.01 et seq., which the Sec-\nretary of Labor has certified to be compliant with \nFUTA, 89 Fed. Reg. 90,053, 90,054 (Nov. 14, 2024).  Wis-\nconsin\u2019s religious-employer exemption mirrors Section \n3309(b)(1)(B).  Wis. Stat. \u00a7 108.02(15)(h)2.  Under Wis-\nconsin law, services are exempt from state unemploy-\nment taxes if they are provided in the employ of \u201can or-\nganization operated primarily for religious purposes \nand operated, supervised, controlled, or principally sup-\nported by a church or convention or association of \nchurches.\u201d  Ibid.  As the state supreme court explained \nin the decision below, when the Wisconsin legislature \nenacted the current version of its exemption, it sought \nto \u201c\u200a\u2018bring Wisconsin\u2019s law in line with\u2019\u200a\u201d and \u201cto con-\nform\u201d with the same exemption in FUTA.  Pet. App. 31a \n(citation omitted).   \n\n5 \n \nB. The Present Controversy \n1. Petitioners\u2014Catholic Charities Bureau, Inc., and \nfour of its sub-entities\u2014are nonprofit organizations \nthat serve as the social-ministry arm of the Diocese of \nSuperior, a diocese of the Roman Catholic Church.  Pet. \nApp. 7a-9a.  They are covered by an exemption from \nfederal income tax under 26 U.S.C. 501(c)(3) for a group \nthat includes \u201cthe educational, charitable, and religious \n[i]nstitutions operated by the Roman Catholic Church \nin the United States.\u201d  Pet. App. 386a; see id. at 10a n.6. \nSince 1917, Catholic Charities Bureau has provided \n\u201cservices to the poor and disadvantaged as an expres-\nsion of the social ministry of the Catholic Church in the \nDiocese of Superior.\u201d  Pet. App. 7a.  Its stated purpose \nis \u201c\u200a\u2018to be an effective sign of the charity of Christ\u2019\u200a\u201d by \nproviding services \u201cthat are \u2018significant in quantity and \nquality\u2019 and not duplicative of services provided by \nother agencies.\u201d  Ibid.  It also oversees several sepa-\nrately incorporated sub-entities, including the other pe-\ntitioners in this case.  Id. at 7a-8a.  The sub-entities pro-\nvide various services for individuals with developmental \nand mental-health disabilities, including subsidized hous-\ning, job placement and training, in-home support ser-\nvices, and transportation.  Id. at 8a-9a, 128a-131a.  The \nsub-entities also set their own \u201corganizational goals and \nmake plans to accomplish those goals, employ staff, set \nprogram policies, enter into contracts, raise funds, and \nassure regulatory compliance.\u201d  Id. at 9a-10a.    \nAlthough the sub-entity petitioners do not receive \nfunding from the Diocese of Superior, Pet. App. 8a-9a, \neach petitioner is subject to the diocesan bishop\u2019s \u201ccon-\ntrol,\u201d id. at 7a.  The bishop serves as the president of \nCatholic Charities Bureau and \u201cappoints its member-\nship,\u201d which in turn \u201c\u200a\u2018provide[s] essential oversight to \n\n6 \n \nensure the fulfillment of the mission of Catholic Chari-\nties Bureau in compliance with the Principles of Catho-\nlic social teaching.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Id. at 7a-8a.  Petitioners and their \nemployees are subject to policies and a code of ethics \nforbidding \u201cactivities that violate Catholic social teach-\nings.\u201d  Id. at 131a; see id. at 371a-385a.   \n2. In 2016, petitioners sought a determination from \nthe Wisconsin Department of Workforce Development \nthat they qualify for the religious-employer exemption \ncodified in Wisconsin\u2019s version of Section 3309(b)(1)(B).  \nPet. App. 10a-11a; see Wis. Stat. \u00a7 108.02(15)(h)2.   \nThe Department denied petitioners\u2019 requests.  Pet. \nApp. 351a-370a.  It was undisputed that petitioners are \n\u201coperated, supervised, controlled, or principally sup-\nported by a church,\u201d Wis. Stat. \u00a7 108.02(15)(h)2, but the \nDepartment concluded that petitioners are not \u201coper-\nated primarily for religious purposes\u201d within the mean-\ning of the exemption.  Pet. App. 352a, 356a, 360a, 364a, \n368a.  Following a hearing, an administrative law judge \nsitting as an appeal tribunal reversed, concluding that \npetitioners are entitled to the exemption.  Id. at 291a-\n350a.   \nOn further administrative appeal, however, the \nState\u2019s Labor and Industry Review Commission rein-\nstated the denials of petitioners\u2019 exemption requests.  \nPet. App. 212a-290a.  The Commission reasoned that an \nentity\u2019s \u201cactivities, not the religious motivation behind \nthem or the organization\u2019s founding principles, deter-\nmine whether an exemption\u201d applies.  Id. at 227a, 242a-\n243a, 258a, 273a-274a, 290a.  It concluded that petition-\ners do not qualify for an exemption under that test be-\ncause \u201c[p]roviding services to those in need is not intrin-\nsically, necessarily, or uniquely religious in nature.\u201d  Id. \nat 224a, 240a, 255a, 271a, 287a-288a. \n\n7 \n \n3. Petitioners sought judicial review in state court. \na. In a bench ruling, the trial court concluded that \npetitioners are entitled to the religious-employer ex-\nemption.  Pet. App. 189a-211a.  The court reasoned that \n\u201cthe test is really why the organizations are operating, \nnot what they are operating,\u201d and found that petitioners \nqualify for the exemption because they are motivated \nby \u201cCatholic tenets\u201d and the \u201creligious motive of the \nCatholic Church of being good stewards, of serving the \nunderserved.\u201d  Id. at 209a. \nb. The state court of appeals reversed.  Pet. App. \n125a-168a.  The court \u201cacknowledge[d] that the pro-\nfessed reason that [petitioners] administer [their] social \nservice programs is for a religious purpose: to fulfill the \nCatechism of the Catholic Church.\u201d  Id. at 163a-164a.  \nBut the court took the view that the exemption requires \nconsideration of \u201cboth the activities of the organization \nas well as the organization\u2019s professed motive or pur-\npose.\u201d  Id. at 146a.  It held that petitioners do not qualify \nfor the exemption because they provide \u201ccharitable so-\ncial services that are neither inherently or primarily re-\nligious activities.\u201d  Id. at 165a. \nc. The state supreme court affirmed in a 4-3 deci-\nsion.  Pet. App. 1a-122a.  The majority reasoned that \n\u201cboth activities and motivations must be considered in a \ndetermination of whether an organization is \u2018operated \nprimarily for religious purposes.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Id. at 21a-22a.  Ac-\ncording to the court, \u201c[c]onsidering purposes, i.e., moti-\nvations, alone would give short shrift to the word \u2018oper-\nated\u2019\u200a\u201d and \u201cessentially render an organization\u2019s mere \nassertion of a religious motive dispositive.\u201d  Id. at 21a, \n23a.  The court thus concluded that analyzing the statu-\ntory exemption requires an \u201cobjective examination of \n\n8 \n \n[petitioners\u2019] actual activities\u201d to determine whether \nthose activities are \u201csecular in nature.\u201d  Id. at 32a.   \nThe state supreme court explained that its interpre-\ntation is consistent with the identical exemption in \nFUTA.  Pet. App. 31a-32a.  It emphasized that Wiscon-\nsin\u2019s exemption \u201ccontains verbatim language to\u201d Sec-\ntion 3309(b)(1) and that the Wisconsin legislature had \nadopted FUTA\u2019s language \u201cto conform\u201d state law with \nthe federal statute.  Id. at 31a.  Because the Wisconsin \nlegislature intended for the state exemption to be \u201cin \nline with\u201d FUTA\u2019s parallel text, the court reasoned that \nFUTA\u2019s legislative history informs the meaning of Wis-\nconsin\u2019s parallel provision.  Ibid. (citation omitted).  The \ncourt also invoked the analysis that federal courts un-\ndertake when evaluating tax-exemption requests under \nSection 501(c)(3), id. at 26a-27a, and when applying the \n\u201cministerial exception\u201d under the First Amendment, id. \nat 27a-28a.   \nUnder its interpretation of the phrase \u201coperated pri-\nmarily for religious purposes,\u201d the state supreme court \nheld that petitioners do not qualify for the religious- \nemployer exemption.  Pet. App. 28a-33a.  Although the \ncourt \u201caccept[ed]\u201d at \u201cface value\u201d petitioners\u2019 \u201casser-\ntions of religious motivation\u201d for their operations, id. at \n29a, it concluded that petitioners \u201care not operated pri-\nmarily for religious purposes\u201d because their activities \n\u201care secular in nature,\u201d id. at 31a-32a.  The court under-\nstood petitioners\u2019 activities to be \u201cprimarily charitable \nand secular\u201d because their \u201cservices can be provided by \norganizations of either religious or secular motivations, \nand the services provided would not differ in any sense.\u201d  \nId. at 30a; see id. at 32a.  The court emphasized that one \nof the sub-entity petitioners \u201chad no affiliation with any \nreligious organization\u201d until 2014, and that \u201cthe services \n\n9 \n \nprovided before and after [its] partnership with [Cath-\nolic Charities Bureau] commenced were exactly the \nsame.\u201d  Id. at 30a. \nThe state supreme court further held that its inter-\npretation does not violate the Free Exercise and Estab-\nlishment Clauses.  Pet. App. at 33a-51a.  The court con-\ncluded that its \u201cneutral and secular inquiry\u201d into peti-\ntioners\u2019 \u201cactual activities,\u201d id. at 40a-41a, does not \n\u201ccross into an evaluation of religious dogma,\u201d id. at 38a.  \nThe court added that its interpretation does not violate \nprinciples of church autonomy because it \u201cneither reg-\nulates internal church governance nor mandates any ac-\ntivity.\u201d  Id. at 45a-46a.  Finally, the court found that its \nstatutory construction does not violate petitioners\u2019 free-\nexercise rights because imposing a generally applicable \ntax is not a constitutionally significant burden.  Id. at \n48a-50a. \nJustice Bradley dissented, joined almost entirely by \nChief Justice Ziegler.  Pet. App. 51a-121a.  According to \nthe dissent, the majority erred in \u201cask[ing] whether\u201d \npetitioners\u2019 activities are \u201creligious in nature\u201d because \n\u201cno activities are inherently religious.\u201d  Id. at 79a.  What \nmakes \u201can activity religious,\u201d the dissent noted, is \u201cre-\nligious motivation.\u201d  Ibid.  The dissent would have ap-\nplied the \u201ccommon-sense understanding\u201d of the term \n\u201cpurposes\u201d and concluded that petitioners qualify for \nthe exemption because it is \u201cuncontested\u201d that petition-\ners\u2019 \u201craison d\u2019\u00eatre is religious.\u201d  Id. at 65a, 67a.  The dis-\nsent also warned that the majority\u2019s interpretation \n\u201ctriggers constitutional quandaries\u201d by \u201cengag[ing] in \nreligious discrimination and entangl[ing] the state with \nreligion in violation of the First Amendment.\u201d  Id. at \n90a; see id. at 90a-121a.   \n\n10 \n \nJustice Hagedorn also dissented.  Pet. App. 121a-\n122a.  He agreed with the primary dissent\u2019s \u201cconstruc-\ntion of the statute,\u201d but \u201cwould not [have] reach[ed] the \nconstitutional questions\u201d implicated in this case.  Ibid. \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nThe religious-employer exemption from the federal-\nstate unemployment-tax framework applies to certain \nchurch-controlled organizations that are \u201coperated pri-\nmarily for religious purposes.\u201d  26 U.S.C. 3309(b)(1)(B); \nWis. Stat. \u00a7 108.02(15)(h)2 (2019-2020).  The Wisconsin \nSupreme Court erred in construing that language to re-\nquire courts to ask not just whether the organization \nhas sincere religious motivations but whether its activi-\nties are inherently religious or secular.  The statutory \ntext makes clear that the relevant inquiry is whether \nthe organization actually operates primarily for reli-\ngious reasons, not whether another organization could \nundertake the same activities for nonreligious reasons.  \nThis Court should reverse. \nA.  The judgment below rests on a misunderstanding \nof federal law.  Although this Court typically accepts the \ninterpretation of state law as announced by that State\u2019s \nhighest court, that principle is inapplicable here be-\ncause the decision below relied on federal case law and \nanalyzed a state-law exemption that is the same as, and \nintended to conform with, the parallel exemption in \nFUTA.  This Court should correct the state court\u2019s mis-\nconstruction, just as it did the last time it construed \nFUTA\u2019s religious-employer exemption and its imple-\nmentation by a parallel state statute.  See St. Martin \nEvangelical Lutheran Church v. South Dakota, 451 \nU.S. 772, 780 n.9 (1981).   \nThe religious-employer exemption applies to organi-\nzations that conduct their affairs primarily for sincere \n\n11 \n \nreligious motivations.  That focus on the subjective in-\ntent motivating an organization\u2019s operations tracks the \nordinary meaning of the statutory terms \u201coperated,\u201d \n\u201cprimarily,\u201d and \u201cpurposes.\u201d  That interpretation also \nfinds support in the broader tax context, including the \nexemption in Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue \nCode.  At the same time, the religious-employer exemp-\ntion allows courts to assess the sincerity and predomi-\nnance of an organization\u2019s asserted purposes. \nThe state supreme court\u2019s contrary reasoning lacks \nmerit.  Rather than adhere to the statutory focus on ac-\ntual intent, the court analyzed whether certain activities \nare inherently religious.  But that interpretation effec-\ntively excises the terms \u201cpurposes\u201d and \u201cprimarily.\u201d   \nB.  Even if this Court concludes that there is statu-\ntory ambiguity, it should still reject the state supreme \ncourt\u2019s view.  That court\u2019s construction, as applied to pe-\ntitioners, would conflict with the First Amendment in at \nleast two respects.   \nFirst, by asking whether an activity is inherently re-\nligious or nonreligious, the decision below invites courts \nto second-guess whether a sincerely held belief or ex-\npression of faith is truly religious.  This Court has made \nclear that the First Amendment guards against that \ntype of intrusive inquiry. \nSecond, the state supreme court\u2019s reasoning creates \na constitutionally impermissible risk that certain reli-\ngions would be treated unequally in the granting and \ndenying of tax exemptions.  The court listed certain acts \n\u2014such as worship services and ceremony, religious out-\nreach, and religious education\u2014that it viewed as enjoy-\ning \u201cstrong indications that the activities are primarily \nreligious in nature.\u201d  Pet. App. 29a.  But that approach \nprivileges the activities of certain religions over others, \n\n12 \n \nespecially minority faiths, thereby discriminating in the \nallocation of benefits or administration of government \nprograms.   \nThe decision also raises additional constitutional con-\ncerns that courts will be entangled in religious issues.  Ac-\ncordingly, this Court should adopt an interpretation of \nthe religious-employer exemption that avoids those con-\nstitutional infirmities and doubts.  St. Martin, 451 U.S. \nat 780. \nC.  Under a proper understanding of the religious-\nemployer exemption, petitioners\u2014organizations that \nserve as the social-ministry arm of a diocese of the Ro-\nman Catholic Church\u2014qualify as organizations \u201coper-\nated primarily for religious purposes.\u201d  And because it \nis undisputed that petitioners satisfy the remaining pre-\nrequisites, petitioners are entitled to the exemption.  \nARGUMENT \nA. The Wisconsin Supreme Court Erred In Construing \nFUTA And Its Identical State-law Analogue \nThe decision below rests on a fundamental misunder-\nstanding of federal law.  The state supreme court mis-\ninterpreted language in a state-law tax provision that is \nmaterially identical to, and intended to conform with, 26 \nU.S.C. 3309(b)(1)(B), and that court relied on federal \nprecedent for its erroneous conclusion.  This Court \nshould reverse.    \n1. This Court should correct the state supreme court\u2019s \nmisunderstanding of federal law \nAlthough petitioners do not directly question the \nstate supreme court\u2019s construction of the relevant stat-\nutes, \u201cthere can be little doubt that granting certiorari \nto determine whether a statute is constitutional fairly \nincludes the question of what that statute says.\u201d  Rums-\n\n13 \n \nfeld v. Forum for Academic & Institutional Rights, Inc., \n547 U.S. 47, 56 (2006) (FAIR).  This Court ordinarily \naccepts the interpretation of state law as announced by \nthat State\u2019s highest court.  See, e.g., O\u2019Brien v. Skinner, \n414 U.S. 524, 531 (1974).  But when a \u201cstate court deci-\nsion fairly appears to rest primarily on federal law, or \nto be interwoven with the federal law, and when the ad-\nequacy and independence of any possible state law \nground is not clear from the face of the opinion,\u201d the \nCourt presumes \u201cthat the state court decided the case \nthe way it did because it believed that federal law re-\nquired it to do so.\u201d  Michigan v. Long, 463 U.S. 1032, \n1040-1041 (1983).  In those circumstances, this Court \nmay correct the state court\u2019s misunderstanding of fed-\neral law.  See ibid.   \nThis Court has already done that in the context of \nFUTA\u2019s exemptions for religious employers.  In St. \nMartin Evangelical Lutheran Church v. South Dakota, \n451 U.S. 772 (1981), the Court reviewed the South Da-\nkota Supreme Court\u2019s decision about a state statute \nthat shared identical text with FUTA.  Id. at 774 nn.1, 2 \n(quoting 26 U.S.C. 3309(b) (1976) and the parallel state \nstatute).  Although the state-court decision technically \n\u201cconcern[ed] the construction of a state statute,\u201d this \nCourt reviewed the state court\u2019s judgment and deter-\nmined \u201cthe proper  * * *  interpretation of the inter-\ntwined federal law.\u201d  Id. at 780 n.9.   \nThe Court should follow the same course here be-\ncause this case involves the proper interpretation of \nFUTA.  Like the state-court judgment under review in \nSt. Martin, the decision below turned on a state-law  \nexemption that is \u201cintertwined\u201d with its parallel exemp-\ntion in FUTA.  451 U.S. at 780 n.9.  The relevant text  \nin both statutes is identical.  Compare 26 U.S.C. \n\n14 \n \n3309(b)(1)(B) (\u201coperated primarily for religious pur-\nposes\u201d), with Wis. Stat. \u00a7 108.02(15)(h)2 (2019-2020) \n(same).  The state supreme court recognized that the \nWisconsin legislature enacted \u201cverbatim language to a \nprovision of federal law\u201d to \u201c\u200a\u2018bring Wisconsin\u2019s law in \nline with\u2019\u200a\u201d and \u201cto conform\u201d state law with FUTA.  Pet. \nApp. 31a (citation omitted).  In analyzing the state stat-\nute, the state court relied on FUTA\u2019s legislative history, \nid. at 27a n.15, 31a-32a, and on federal case law inter-\npreting the similarly worded Section 501(c)(3) of the In-\nternal Revenue Code, id. at 23a, 26a-29a, 40a.  And the \nWisconsin Attorney General has supported an \u201canalyti-\ncal approach  * * *  consistent with the congressional \nhistory of FUTA\u201d and treated decisions from various \nstate courts as presenting \u201csimilar interpretation ques-\ntions\u201d precisely because the States have \u201ccopied the lan-\nguage of [FUTA].\u201d  Br. in Opp. 8, 14. \n2. The religious-employer exemption covers organiza-\ntions that conduct their affairs sincerely and princi-\npally for religious reasons \nStatutory interpretation \u201cbegins with the statutory \ntext.\u201d  National Ass\u2019n of Mfrs. v. Department of De-\nfense, 583 U.S. 109, 127 (2018) (citation omitted).  If \u201cthe \nplain language\u201d is \u201c\u200a\u2018unambiguous,\u2019\u200a\u201d the inquiry \u201c\u200a\u2018ends \nthere as well.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Ibid. (citation omitted).  The statutory \ntext at issue here means that the exemption applies to \norganizations that conduct their affairs sincerely and \nfundamentally with religious motivations.   \na. The religious-employer exemption added to FUTA \nin 1970 and its state-law analogue apply to services per-\nformed in the employ of \u201can organization which is oper-\nated primarily for religious purposes and which is oper-\nated, supervised, controlled, or principally supported  \nby a church or convention or association of churches.\u201d  \n\n15 \n \n26 U.S.C. 3309(b)(1)(B); see Wis. Stat. \u00a7 108.02(15)(h)2.  \nBecause the parties agree that petitioners are \u201coper-\nated, supervised, controlled, or principally supported by \na church,\u201d Pet. App. 5a n.3, 218a-219a, only the first \nclause of the provisions is at issue.  \nThe relevant statutory terms here are \u201coperated,\u201d \n\u201cprimarily,\u201d and \u201cpurposes.\u201d  The term \u201coperated\u201d is \nthe past-participle form of the transitive verb \u201coperate,\u201d \nwhich means, as pertinent here, \u201cto manage and put or \nkeep in operation.\u201d  Webster\u2019s Third New International \nDictionary 1581 (1971) (Webster\u2019s) (giving the example \n\u201coperated a grocery store\u201d); see 10 The Oxford English \nDictionary 848 (2d ed. 1989) (OED) (\u201cTo direct the \nworking of; to manage, conduct, work (a railway, busi-\nness, etc.); to carry out or through, direct to an end (a \nprinciple, an undertaking, etc.).\u201d).  The ordinary mean-\ning of \u201cprimarily\u201d is \u201cfundamentally, principally,\u201d or \n\u201cfirst of all.\u201d  Webster\u2019s 1800 (capitalization omitted); \nsee 12 OED 472 (\u201cIn the first place; first of all, preemi-\nnently, chiefly, principally; essentially.\u201d).  And a \u201cpur-\npose\u201d is \u201can end or aim to be kept in view in any plan, \nmeasure, exertion, or operation.\u201d  Webster\u2019s 1847; see \n12 OED 878 (\u201cthe object which one has in view\u201d; \u201c[t]he \nobject for which anything is done or made, or for which \nit exists;  * * *  end, aim.\u201d).   \nRead naturally, those terms mean that the relevant \ninquiry\u2014determining whether an organization \u201cis oper-\nated primarily for religious purposes\u201d\u2014is whether the \nprincipal objects or aims for the organization\u2019s activities \nare religious.  That inquiry turns on the organization\u2019s \nown objects or aims\u2014not on whether that organization \n(or another one) could have engaged in the same kinds \nof activities in the service of nonreligious aims.  The tax \nexemption at issue here is based on an organization\u2019s \n\n16 \n \nfundamental motivation for its affairs, not on the nature \nof the activities through which it pursues its purposes.1 \nb. That interpretation of FUTA\u2019s exemption finds \nsupport in the broader tax context.  For instance, this \nCourt employed a similar approach in Better Business \nBureau of Washington, D.C., Inc. v. United States, 326 \nU.S. 279 (1945), when it construed a tax exemption in \nthe Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. 301 et seq., that had \nbeen incorporated into the Internal Revenue Code.  326 \nU.S. at 280 n.1.  Much as FUTA and Wisconsin\u2019s parallel \nprovision tether the applicability of a tax exemption to \nan organization\u2019s principal purpose, the Social Security \nAct provided an exemption for \u201c[s]ervice performed in \nthe employ of a corporation  * * *  organized and oper-\nated exclusively for religious, charitable, scientific, lit-\nerary, or educational purposes.\u201d  26 U.S.C. 1426(b)(8) \n(1940).  This Court recognized that the exemption fo-\ncused on the corporation\u2019s purposes animating its activ-\nities, not the nature of its actions.  See Better Business \nBureau, 326 U.S. at 283-284.  The Court concluded that \nthe exemption did not apply to the Better Business Bu-\nreau because, even though it sought to educate busi-\nnesses and the public about honest business practices, \nits corporate charter and title reflected that its \u201cactivi-\nties we[re] largely animated by\u201d the non-exempt \u201ccom-\n \n1 The decision below suggested that a court must look at the mo-\ntivation of the organization seeking the exemption, and not the mo-\ntivation of a church that controls the organization.  Pet. App. 16a-\n17a.  That observation is immaterial because all agreed that peti-\ntioners have sincerely held religious motivations.  Id. at 29a.  It is \nalso incorrect because the exemption contemplates that an organi-\nzation \u201coperated primarily for religious purposes\u201d is in some cases \n\u201coperated  * * *  by a church.\u201d  26 U.S.C. 3309(b)(1)(B); Wis. Stat. \n\u00a7 108.02(15)(h)2.  In those circumstances, the church\u2019s own purposes \nare at issue.   \n\n17 \n \nmercial purpose\u201d of promoting practices that would \nhelp merchants \u201cprofitably conduct their business.\u201d  Id. \nat 284.  The Court concluded that the organization\u2019s ef-\nforts were \u201cdirected fundamentally to ends other than \nthat of education,\u201d ibid., without determining whether \nits activities were innately educational or pedagogical.   \nCourts have similarly construed the longstanding \nand widely used exemption in Section 501(c)(3) of the \nInternal Revenue Code by focusing on an organization\u2019s \npurposes.  Section 501(c)(3) provides that an organiza-\ntion is exempt from federal income tax if it is \u201corganized \nand operated exclusively\u201d for, among other things, \u201cre-\nligious\u201d purposes.  26 U.S.C. 501(c)(3).2  To determine \nwhether an organization is exempt, courts and the In-\nternal Revenue Service have focused on \u201cthe purposes \ntoward which an organization\u2019s activities are directed, \nand not the nature of the activities.\u201d  Living Faith, Inc. \nv. Commissioner, 950 F.2d 365, 370 (7th Cir. 1991) (ci-\ntation omitted); see, e.g., Presbyterian & Reformed \nPubl\u2019g Co. v. Commissioner, 743 F.2d 148, 156 (3d Cir. \n1984) (\u201c[T]he inquiry must remain that of determining \nthe purpose to which the increased business activity is \ndirected.\u201d); Dumaine Farms v. Commissioner, 73 T.C. \n650, 663-668 (1980) (similar); Golden Rule Church Ass\u2019n \nv. Commissioner, 41 T.C. 719, 728 (1964) (similar);  \nIRS, Publication 5859: Exempt Organizations Tech-\nnical Guide 19-20 (Feb. 1, 2024), https://www.irs.gov/\npub/irs-pdf/p5859.pdf. \n \n2 The phrase \u201corganized and operated exclusively\u201d under Section \n501(c)(3) has long been understood to include organizations \u201cen-\ngage[d] primarily in activities which accomplish one or more of such \nexempt purposes.\u201d  26 C.F.R. 1.501(c)(3)-1(c)(1) (emphasis added); \nsee, e.g., Mayo Clinic v. United States, 997 F.3d 789, 800 (8th Cir. \n2021).  \n\n18 \n \nThe decisions in Living Faith, Dumaine Farms, and \nGolden Rule Church are instructive.  In each instance, \nthe organizations seeking Section 501(c)(3) exemptions \nengaged in activity that could be thought commercial in \nnature (and thus non-exempt).  Living Faith, 950 F.2d \nat 367 (restaurants and stores); Dumaine Farms, 73 \nT.C. at 651 (farming); Golden Rule Church, 41 T.C. at \n723-724 (laundry, livestock, lodging, and lumber opera-\ntions).  But the nature of the activities was not disposi-\ntive:  Instead, the inquiry focused on the purpose for \nwhich seemingly commercial activities were performed.  \nIn Living Faith, the court held that the organization did \nnot qualify for the exemption because it operated not \nonly for a religious purpose but for a \u201csubstantial com-\nmercial purpose as well,\u201d such that the religious pur-\npose did not predominate.  950 F.2d at 376.  By contrast, \nthe organizations in Dumaine Farms and Golden Rule \nChurch qualified for Section 501(c)(3) status because \nthey engaged in ostensibly commercial activities for \ntax-exempt reasons.  Dumaine Farms, 73 T.C. at 663-\n668 (scientific and educational purposes); Golden Rule \nChurch, 41 T.C. at 729-732 (religious purposes).  Secu-\nlar, for-profit organizations also engage in farming, \nlaundry, and other activities that might typically be \nviewed as commercial\u2014but that did not foreclose the \nconclusion that the organizations in Dumaine Farms \nand Golden Rule Church engaged in those activities pri-\nmarily for exempt purposes.   \nThus, the decision below erred in suggesting that \nSection 501(c)(3) supports an inquiry into whether an \nactivity is inherently \u201creligious in nature.\u201d  Pet. App. \n29a; see id. at 26a-30a.  The state supreme court\u2019s prin-\ncipal citation, United States v. Dykema, 666 F.2d 1096 \n(7th Cir. 1981), cert. denied, 456 U.S. 983 (1982), does \n\n19 \n \nnot support that proposition.  Although Dykema follows \na long line of cases correctly recognizing that courts \nmay assess whether a religious belief is sincerely held \nor actually motivating a claimant (see pp. 19-21, infra), \nthat decision did not suggest that courts may deem cer-\ntain actions inherently nonreligious, and it avoided \u201cen-\ntering into any subjective inquiry with respect to reli-\ngious truth.\u201d  666 F.2d at 1100.  \nThere is no sound reason to conclude that Congress \nintended to require a different approach for FUTA\u2019s  \nreligious-employer exemption, or that the Wisconsin \nLegislature intended to prescribe a different mode of \nanalysis when it amended state law \u201cto conform\u201d with \nFUTA.  Pet. App. 31a. \nc. Although FUTA and Wisconsin\u2019s parallel statute \nfocus on an organization\u2019s subjective motivations, courts \nhave an important role to play in assessing whether the \nexemption applies.  Specifically, courts may assess the \nsincerity and predominance of an organization\u2019s as-\nserted purposes. \nFirst, courts may assess an organization\u2019s sincerity.  \nThis Court has repeatedly explained that a religious \nmotivation is to be credited when it is sincerely held and \nauthentic.  See, e.g., Hernandez v. Commissioner, 490 \nU.S. 680, 693 (1989) (First Amendment); Burwell v. \nHobby Lobby Stores, Inc., 573 U.S. 682, 723-726 (2014) \n(Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993, 42 U.S.C. \n2000bb et seq.); Cutter v. Wilkinson, 544 U.S. 709, 725 \nn.13 (2005) (Religious Land Use and Institutionalized \nPersons Act of 2000 (RLUIPA), 42 U.S.C. 2000cc et \nseq.).   \nSecond, courts may consider whether an organiza-\ntion was actually and principally motivated by its as-\nserted purpose.  That too is a familiar concept in the law.  \n\n20 \n \nIn the First Amendment context, this Court has recog-\nnized that an actor\u2019s choices may be \u201cphilosophical and \npersonal rather than religious,\u201d and thus \u201cnot rise to the \ndemands of the Religion Clauses.\u201d  Wisconsin v. Yoder, \n406 U.S. 205, 216 (1972).  Similarly, in Ramirez v. Col-\nlier, 595 U.S. 411 (2022)\u2014involving a death-row inmate\u2019s \nright under RLUIPA to pray with his pastor in the ex-\necution chamber\u2014this Court considered whether the \nplaintiff\u200a\u2019s conduct and his prior statements suggested a \nmotivation other than \u201csincere religious exercise.\u201d  Id. \nat 426.  And in Better Business Bureau, this Court af-\nfirmed the denial of a social-security-tax exemption for \nan entity that claimed to have predominantly \u201cscientific \nor educational purposes.\u201d  326 U.S. at 280.  Rather than \ntake the organization\u2019s assertions at face value, the \nCourt concluded that the entity was not truly \u201cani-\nmated\u201d by its professed motivation, and that its actual \naims were instead \u201cdirected fundamentally\u201d to a non-\nexempt \u201ccommercial purpose.\u201d  Id. at 284. \nIn analyzing the sincerity and primacy of an organi-\nzation\u2019s stated purposes, \u201ca variety of factors may be im-\nportant.\u201d  Our Lady of Guadalupe Sch. v. Morrissey-\nBerru, 591 U.S. 732, 751 (2020) (addressing the applica-\nbility of the \u201cministerial exception\u201d to employment- \ndiscrimination claims) (citation omitted).  An organiza-\ntion\u2019s founding documents, bylaws, and public state-\nments may be relevant to assessing its true motivations.  \nSee Better Business Bureau, 326 U.S. at 283-284 (ex-\namining \u201ccorporate title\u201d and \u201ccharter provisions\u201d); \nHobby Lobby, 573 U.S. at 702-703 (examining other cor-\nporate statements).  An organization\u2019s prior assertions \nmay also be relevant.  See Ramirez, 595 U.S. at 426.  \nLikewise, a court could consider whether the organiza-\ntion \u201cholds itself out to the public as a religious institu-\n\n21 \n \ntion.\u201d  Duquesne Univ. of the Holy Spirit v. NLRB, 947 \nF.3d 824, 832 (D.C. Cir. 2020) (applying inferred reli-\ngious exemption from the National Labor Relations \nAct, 29 U.S.C. 151 et seq.).  And in some circumstances, \nthe \u201cparticular manner in which an organization\u2019s activ-\nities are conducted, the commercial hue of those activi-\nties, competition with commercial firms, and the exist-\nence and amount of annual or accumulated profits\u201d \ncould be \u201crelevant evidence.\u201d  Living Faith, 950 F.2d at \n372 (addressing Section 501(c)(3)).  Nevertheless, \u201c[i]n \nconsidering the circumstances of any given case, courts \nmust take care to avoid \u2018resolving underlying controver-\nsies over religious doctrine.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Our Lady, 591 U.S. at 751 \nn.10 (citation omitted).   \n3. The Wisconsin Supreme Court\u2019s contrary reasoning \nlacks merit \nThe state supreme court disregarded the exemp-\ntion\u2019s focus on subjective intent and instead analyzed \nwhether certain actions are, in its view, inherently reli-\ngious or secular in nature.  That interpretation has \nscant basis in the statutory text.   \na. The Wisconsin Supreme Court acknowledged \nthat a \u201c\u200a\u2018purpose\u2019\u200a\u201d is ordinarily \u201c\u200a\u2018the reason for which \nsomething exists or is done,\u2019\u200a\u201d and it \u201cimplies \u2018motiva-\ntion.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Pet. App. 21a (citations omitted).  Yet the court \nasserted that \u201c[c]onsidering purposes, i.e., motivations, \nalone would give short shrift to the word \u2018operated\u2019\u200a\u201d in \nthe statute and would \u201cessentially render an organiza-\ntion\u2019s mere assertion of a religious motive dispositive.\u201d  \nId. at 21a, 23a.  The court therefore took the view that \nWisconsin and federal law require assessing the nature \nof an organization\u2019s activities to determine whether \nthey are intrinsically religious or secular.  Id. at 30a-\n\n22 \n \n33a.  Those conclusions disregard the statutory text in \ntwo respects.   \nFirst, the decision below effectively excised the term \n\u201cpurposes\u201d from the statutory exemption.  Courts should \n\u201cgive effect to every clause and word of a statute.\u201d  \nPolselli v. IRS, 598 U.S. 432, 441 (2023) (brackets and \ncitation omitted).  Here, however, the state supreme \ncourt focused on whether petitioners\u2019 operations \u201cwould \nbe the same regardless of the motivation\u201d behind them.  \nPet. App. 31a (emphasis added).  For example, the court \nfound that petitioners\u2019 conduct is inherently nonreli-\ngious because one of the sub-entity petitioners provided \n\u201cexactly the same\u201d services before and after it came un-\nder the \u201cumbrella\u201d of Catholic Charities Bureau and the \nbishop of the Diocese of Superior.  Id. at 30a.  That \nblinkered approach ignores the statutory focus on the \norganization\u2019s aims in operating its affairs. \nThe primary example provided in the decision below \nunderscores the errors in its analysis.  According to the \nstate supreme court, \u201c[t]he services provided by a reli-\ngiously run orphanage and a secular one do not differ in \nany meaningful sense.\u201d  Pet. App. 32a.  But they differ \nin a sense made meaningful by the statute.  While it may \nbe true that certain activities associated with running \nan orphanage could be the same notwithstanding a par-\nticular actor\u2019s motives, that provides no basis to ignore \nthe statute\u2019s focus on purposes (i.e., what would, in the \ninstance of an individual, be the mental state that ac-\ncompanied the activities).  Whether an action has reli-\ngious meaning depends on the circumstances, especially \nthe actor\u2019s intent.  Some might grow their beards for \nsecular reasons, while others may do so \u201cin accordance \nwith [their] religious beliefs.\u201d  Holt v. Hobbs, 574 U.S. \n352, 355-356 (2015).  Drinking tea may have no religious \n\n23 \n \nsignificance for some, but be \u201ca sincere exercise of reli-\ngion\u201d for others.  Gonzales v. O Centro Espirita Bene-\nficente Uniao do Vegetal, 546 U.S. 418, 423 (2006).  And \nsome may abstain from certain foods for reasons of \nhealth or taste, while others do so on religious grounds.  \nThe statutory reference to \u201creligious purposes\u201d captures \nan analogous\u2014and meaningful\u2014difference.  The deci-\nsion below, by contrast, would treat certain conduct as \ncategorically secular and foreclose an organization from \nclaiming a religious basis for its activities, no matter \nhow sincere or profoundly religious its reasons may be.   \nSecond, the Wisconsin Supreme Court failed to give \nadequate effect to the term \u201cprimarily.\u201d  26 U.S.C. \n3309(b)(1)(B); Wis. Stat. \u00a7 108.02(15)(h)2.  The court did \nnot separately analyze that term at all:  In its view, the \n\u201ckey words\u201d were \u201c\u200a\u2018operated\u2019 and \u2018purposes,\u2019\u200a\u201d Pet. \nApp. 20a, and on that understanding the court endeav-\nored to avoid \u201crender[ing] an organization\u2019s mere asser-\ntion of religious motive dispositive,\u201d id. at 23a.  But the \nstatutory text makes clear that an asserted religious \nmotive must be the principal or fundamental purpose \nbehind an organization\u2019s affairs.  See pp. 14-16, supra.   \nHewing to the plain meaning of \u201cprimarily\u201d would \nminimize the state supreme court\u2019s concern that \u201cany \nreligiously affiliated organization would always be ex-\nempt\u201d based on the theory that \u201c[a] church\u2019s purpose is \nreligious by nature.\u201d  Pet. App. 18a; see id. at 21a-23a.  \nAssessing the motivations for an organization\u2019s affairs \nhelps to ensure that the religious-employer exemption \ndoes not extend to entities that are not actually oper-\nated primarily for religious purposes.   \nb. The Wisconsin Supreme Court advanced three \nadditional rationales for its unpersuasive interpretation \nof the statutory text.  None has merit.   \n\n24 \n \nFirst, the state supreme court reasoned that nar-\nrowly construing a tax exemption would serve the goal \nof compensating the unemployed.  Pet. App. 14a, 21a-\n24a, 31a-32a.  But \u201c\u200a\u2018[n]o legislation pursues its purposes \nat all costs,\u2019\u200a and \u2018every statute purposes, not only to \nachieve certain ends, but also to achieve them by partic-\nular means.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Freeman v. Quicken Loans, Inc., 566 \nU.S. 624, 637 (2012) (brackets and citations omitted).  \nAlthough FUTA and related state laws seek to foster \u201ca \ncooperative federal-state program of benefits to unem-\nployed workers,\u201d Wimberly v. Labor & Indus. Rela-\ntions Comm\u2019n, 479 U.S. 511, 514 (1987), the decision be-\nlow gave short shrift to the specific statutory goal of ex-\nempting certain organizations, including entities that \nare \u201coperated primarily for religious purposes and which \n[are] operated, supervised, controlled, or principally \nsupported by a church or convention or association of \nchurches.\u201d  26 U.S.C. 3309(b)(1)(B); see Pet. App. 31a \n(observing Wisconsin legislature\u2019s intent to \u201cbring Wis-\nconsin\u2019s law in line with\u201d federal exemption) (citation \nomitted); see also BP p.l.c. v. Mayor & City Council of \nBaltimore, 593 U.S. 230, 239 (2021) (\u201cExceptions and \nexemptions are no less part of Congress\u2019s work than its \nrules and standards[.]\u201d).  In any event, \u201c[v]ague notions \nof statutory purpose provide no warrant\u201d to ignore the \n\u201cunambiguous[]\u201d statutory text.  Freeman, 566 U.S. at \n637; see St. Martin, 451 U.S. at 786 n.19 (\u201c[G]eneral \nstatements of overall purpose  * * *  cannot defeat the \nspecific and clear wording of a statute.\u201d).   \nSecond, the decision below relied on a committee re-\nport in FUTA\u2019s legislative history for the proposition \nthat certain church-related \u201ccharitable organization[s] \n(such as an orphanage or a home for the aged) would not \nbe considered  * * *  to be operated primarily for reli-\n\n25 \n \ngious purposes.\u201d  Pet. App. 32a (emphasis omitted) \n(quoting H.R. Rep. No. 612, 91st Cong., 1st Sess. 44 \n(1969)).  In finding that petitioners did not qualify for \nan exemption, the state supreme court compared their \nactivities\u2014e.g., providing \u201cdevelopmental services\u201d\u2014to \nthe \u201csecular\u201d examples in the committee report.  Ibid.   \nThat reasoning was flawed because, among other \nthings, \u201cCongress\u2019s \u2018authoritative statement is the stat-\nutory text, not the legislative history.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Chamber of \nCommerce v. Whiting, 563 U.S. 582, 599 (2011) (citation \nomitted).  And even \u201c[t]hose [Members of this Court] \nwho make use of legislative history\u201d do so when \u201cclear \nevidence of congressional intent may illuminate ambig-\nuous text.\u201d  Delaware v. Pennsylvania, 598 U.S. 115, \n138-139 (2023) (citation omitted).  Here, the committee \nreport does not constitute clear evidence, and the en-\nacted text is not ambiguous, see pp. 14-19, supra.  The \nreport\u2019s drafters did not explain why the plain text \nwould not reach the parenthetical examples.  Nor did \nthey have the benefit of the intervening half-century  \nof this Court\u2019s jurisprudence concerning the Religion \nClauses.3 \n \n3 In a 1987 advisory letter, the Department of Labor took the view \nthat the religious-employer exemption would not cover \u201centities \nwith a religious orientation but which are not affiliated with a par-\nticular church, or convention or association of churches\u201d\u2014such as \n\u201cnondenominational college[s]\u201d\u2014because such \u201centities are not op-\nerated, supervised, controlled, or principally supported by a church \nor convention or association of churches.\u201d  52 Fed. Reg. 27,072 (July \n17, 1987).  That letter is inapplicable because it did not address the \nrelevant phrase (\u201coperated primarily for religious purposes\u201d) and it \nis common ground that petitioners are \u201coperated, supervised, con-\ntrolled, or principally supported by a church,\u201d Pet. App. 5a n.3, 218a-\n219a. \n\n26 \n \nFinally, the Wisconsin Supreme Court erred in in-\nvoking cases applying the \u201c\u200a\u2018ministerial exception\u2019\u200a\u201d to \nsupport its view that it is appropriate to analyze the in-\nherent nature of a religious organization\u2019s \u201cactions\u201d to \ndetermine whether its \u201cactivities are primarily charita-\nble and secular.\u201d  Pet. App. 24a-25a & n.14, 30a (citation \nomitted).  The ministerial exception \u201cforeclose[s] cer-\ntain employment discrimination claims brought against \nreligious organizations\u201d based on the constitutionally \nprotected \u201cprinciple of church autonomy  * * *  in mat-\nters of faith and doctrine and in closely linked matters \nof internal government.\u201d  Our Lady, 591 U.S. at 747.  \nWhile this Court has taken care to explain that \u201ca vari-\nety of factors may be important\u201d in \u201cdetermining \nwhether a particular position falls within the  * * *  ex-\nception,\u201d id. at 751, the Court has likewise emphasized \nthat \u201c[i]n a country with the religious diversity of the \nUnited States, judges cannot be expected to have a com-\nplete understanding and appreciation of the role played \nby every person who performs a particular role in every \nreligious tradition,\u201d id. at 757; see id. at 771-772 (So-\ntomayor, J., dissenting) (noting that the \u201cinquiry is ho-\nlistic\u201d and examines whether an organization acted \u201cfor \nnonreligious reasons\u201d) (emphasis added).  In short, the \n\u201cministerial exception\u201d does not suggest that courts \nmay subordinate an organization\u2019s sincerely held beliefs \nand actual motivations to the conclusion that certain ac-\ntivities are categorically nonreligious.   \nB. The Decision Below Conflicts With The Free Exercise \nAnd Establishment Clauses \nEven if this Court concludes that there is statutory \nambiguity, it should still reverse the judgment of the \nstate supreme court, which construes the text in ways \nthat, as applied to petitioners, violate the First Amend-\n\n27 \n \nment.  That court\u2019s approach wrongly invites govern-\nment officials to question whether a particular expres-\nsion of faith is sufficiently \u201creligious\u201d and to discrimi-\nnate among certain faiths.  And it may require govern-\nment officials to second-guess an entity\u2019s religious mis-\nsion or to analyze an organization\u2019s adherence to reli-\ngious tenets.  Of course, this Court normally \u201cwill not \ndecide a constitutional question if there is some other \nground upon which to dispose of the case.\u201d  Bond v. \nUnited States, 572 U.S. 844, 855 (2014) (citation omit-\nted).  Accordingly, the Court should adopt an interpre-\ntation that \u201cavoid[s] serious constitutional doubts,\u201d Iancu \nv. Brunetti, 588 U.S. 388, 397 (2019) (citation omitted)\u2014\njust as it did the last time it construed FUTA\u2019s religious-\nemployer exemption and its implementation by a paral-\nlel state statute.  St. Martin, 451 U.S. at 780. \n1. The First Amendment, which applies to the \nStates under the Fourteenth Amendment, provides that \n\u201cCongress shall make no law respecting an establish-\nment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.\u201d  \nThose clauses guarantee to religious organizations the \nright to \u201cdecide for themselves, free from state inter-\nference, matters of church government as well as those \nof faith and doctrine.\u201d  Kedroff v. Saint Nicholas Cathe-\ndral of the Russian Orthodox Church in N. Am., 344 \nU.S. 94, 116 (1952); see Serbian E. Orthodox Diocese v. \nMilivojevich, 426 U.S. 696, 724-725 (1976); see also  \nHosanna-Tabor Evangelical Lutheran Church & Sch. \nv. EEOC, 565 U.S. 171, 186-187 (2012).  They also guard \nagainst religious discrimination in the allocation of ben-\nefits or administration of government programs.  Car-\nson v. Makin, 596 U.S. 767, 778 (2022) (Free Exercise \nClause); Larson v. Valente, 456 U.S. 228, 246 (1982) (Es-\ntablishment Clause). \n\n28 \n \na. The state supreme court\u2019s decision flouts those \nfundamental First Amendment principles in at least two \nrespects.  First, the court\u2019s reasoning invites judges to \ninquire whether a sincerely held belief or expression of \nfaith is truly religious.  The court reasoned that some \nservices are \u201csecular by nature\u201d because they \u201cwould \nnot differ in any sense,\u201d whether they were \u201cprovided \nby organizations of either religious or secular motiva-\ntions.\u201d  Pet. App. 30a.  But this Court has admonished \nthat \u201c[i]t is not within the judicial ken to question the \ncentrality of particular beliefs or practices to a faith, or \nthe validity of particular litigants\u2019 interpretations of \nthose creeds.\u201d  Hernandez, 490 U.S. at 699 (citation \nomitted); see New York v. Cathedral Academy, 434 U.S. \n125, 133 (1977).  That is, courts should not decide \u201cwhat \nis a \u2018religious\u2019 belief or practice\u201d based on \u201ca judicial \nperception of the particular belief or practice in ques-\ntion.\u201d  Thomas v. Review Bd. of the Ind. Emp\u2019t Sec. Div., \n450 U.S. 707, 714 (1981).  Rather, \u201creligious beliefs need \nnot be acceptable, logical, consistent, or comprehensible \nto others in order to merit First Amendment protec-\ntion.\u201d  Fulton v. City of Philadelphia, 593 U.S. 522, 532 \n(2021) (quoting Thomas, 450 U.S. at 714).  Indeed, \u201c[r]eli-\ngion may have as much to do with why one takes an ac-\ntion as it does with what action one takes.\u201d  University \nof Great Falls v. NLRB, 278 F.3d 1335, 1346 (D.C. Cir. \n2002) (emphases added); see ibid. (\u201cThat a secular uni-\nversity might share some goals and practices with a \nCatholic or other religious institution cannot render the \nactions of the latter any less religious.\u201d). \nBy treating certain actions as inherently secular, the \ndecision below also conflicts with this Court\u2019s reasoning \nin Corporation of the Presiding Bishop of the Church of \nJesus Christ of Latter-day Saints v. Amos, 483 U.S. 327 \n\n29 \n \n(1987).  Amos held that Title VII\u2019s exemption for certain \nreligious entities, 42 U.S.C. 2000e-1(a), comports with \nthe Establishment Clause because that exemption \u201cal-\nleviate[s] significant governmental interference with \nthe ability of religious organizations to define and carry \nout their religious missions.\u201d  483 U.S. at 335.  The Court \nemphasized that the broad exemption \u201cavoids the kind \nof intrusive inquiry into religious belief\u200a\u201d that the First \nAmendment forbids.  Id. at 339 (emphasis added).  The \nCourt further observed that it would be \u201ca significant \nburden on a religious organization to require it, on pain \nof substantial liability, to predict which of its activities \na secular court will consider religious,\u201d particularly be-\ncause a court might \u201cnot understand its religious tenets \nand sense of mission.\u201d  Id. at 336.  Justices Brennan and \nMarshall concurred because, in their view, it would have \nbeen \u201cinappropriate\u201d under the First Amendment to \nconduct a \u201ccase-by-case determination whether [a non-\nprofit corporation\u2019s] nature is religious or secular\u201d when \napplying Title VII\u2019s religious-corporation exception.  \nId. at 340 (Brennan, J., concurring in the judgment).  \nThe decision below, however, would require courts to \nengage in the same analysis that Amos considered to be \nconstitutionally infirm. \nThe decision below is likewise incompatible with \nHernandez v. Commissioner, supra, which construed \n26 U.S.C. 170(c)(2)(B), a provision allowing deductions \nfor a \u201ccontribution or gift\u201d for use by an organization \n\u201corganized and operated exclusively for religious  * * *  \npurposes.\u201d  This Court rejected a taxpayer\u2019s argument \nthat quid pro quo transactions could qualify for the ex-\nemption if the payer received \u201cbenefits of a religious na-\nture\u201d in exchange, Hernandez, 490 U.S. at 694, because \n\u201cunder the First Amendment, the IRS can reject other-\n\n30 \n \nwise valid claims of religious benefit only on the ground \nthat a taxpayers\u2019 alleged beliefs are not sincerely held, \nbut not on the ground that such beliefs are inherently \nirreligious,\u201d id. at 693 (citing United States v. Ballard, \n322 U.S. 78 (1944)).  The Court made clear that such an \ninquiry \u201cmight raise problems of entanglement between \nchurch and state,\u201d and that \u201c\u200a\u2018pervasive monitoring\u2019 for \n\u2018the subtle or overt presence of religious matter\u2019 is a \ncentral danger against which we have held the Estab-\nlishment Clause guards.\u201d  Id. at 694 (citation omitted).  \nYet, the decision below would force officials and courts \ninto that constitutional thicket by requiring them to de-\ncide whether an activity is inherently \u201creligious\u201d or \u201csec-\nular\u201d in \u201cnature.\u201d  Pet. App. 29a, 32a. \nSecond, the Wisconsin Supreme Court\u2019s construction \nof Section 3309(b)(1)(B) and the parallel state statute \npresents an impermissible danger that certain religions \n\u2014including minority faiths\u2014would be treated unequally \nin the granting and denying of tax exemptions.  This \nCourt has made clear that the First Amendment forbids \ngovernments to condition benefits on the degree of an \norganization\u2019s perceived religiosity.  For example, in \nCarson v. Makin, supra, the Court held that the Free \nExercise Clause precludes a State from excluding a \nschool from a tuition-assistance program on the ground \nthat the school \u201cpromotes a particular faith and pre-\nsents academic material through the lens of that faith.\u201d  \n596 U.S. at 787 (citation omitted).  That distinction, the \nCourt observed, would \u201craise serious concerns about \nstate entanglement with religion and denominational fa-\nvoritism\u201d because such a test might favor religious \nschools that do not evangelize or inject religious views \ninto secular instruction.  Ibid.; see also Larson, 456 U.S. \nat 245 (\u201cThis constitutional prohibition of denomina-\n\n31 \n \ntional preferences is inextricably connected with the \ncontinuing vitality of the Free Exercise Clause.\u201d).  The \nCourt has further explained that \u201c[r]equiring\u201d different \nfaiths to share certain characteristics\u2014such as \u201cuse of \n[a] title\u201d\u2014\u201cwould constitute impermissible discrimina-\ntion\u201d and \u201crisk privileging religious traditions with\u201d \ncertain tenets over others.  Our Lady, 591 U.S. at 752-\n753; see Yoder, 406 U.S. at 216-217. \nThe decision below privileges \u201conly a small, and ill-\ndefined, subset of religious activities,\u201d Pet. App. 104a \n(Bradley, J., dissenting), as qualifying for the exemp-\ntion under FUTA and Wisconsin law.  The state supreme \ncourt listed certain activities\u2014e.g., \u201cworship services, \nreligious outreach, ceremony, or religious education\u201d\u2014\nthat it viewed as enjoying \u201cstrong indications that the \nactivities are primarily religious in nature.\u201d  Id. at 29a.  \nBut that approach exalts \u201clargely Protestant[] religious \nactivities\u201d and diminishes other actions that may have \nprofound importance in other faiths, such as \u201cCatholi-\ncism, Judaism, Islam, Sikhism, Hinduism, Buddhism, \nHare Krishna, and the Church of Latter Day Saints, \namong others.\u201d  Id. at 53a, 106a (Bradley, J., dissent-\ning).   \nb. Even apart from those violations of First Amend-\nment principles, the decision below raises additional \nconstitutional concerns.  For example, the state supreme \ncourt reasoned that petitioners are not \u201coperated pri-\nmarily for religious purposes,\u201d 26 U.S.C. 3309(b)(1)(B); \nWis. Stat. \u00a7 108.02(15)(h)2, on the theory that they offer \n\u201cemployment\u201d and \u201cservices\u201d to individuals \u201cregardless \nof religion,\u201d Pet. App. 30a.  But limiting the tax exemp-\ntion to organizations that hire or serve only those who \nshare their faith\u2014or to organizations that directly ex-\npose employees or program participants to religious \n\n32 \n \ndoctrine, materials, or ceremony, id. at 29a\u2014presents a \nsignificant risk that courts would second-guess the con-\ntent of an entity\u2019s religious mission in violation of the \nFirst Amendment.   \nSimilarly, this Court has cautioned that determining \nwho is a \u201cmember\u201d of \u201cthe religion with which the em-\nployer is associated\u201d may be a question that \u201cwould risk \njudicial entanglement in religious issues.\u201d  Our Lady, \n591 U.S. at 761.  Indeed, when a religious group attests \nto its \u201creligious creeds,\u201d a court\u2019s \u201cinquiry into the good \nfaith of the position asserted by the clergy-administra-\ntors and its relationship to the [group\u2019s] religious mis-\nsion\u201d may itself \u201cimpinge on rights guaranteed by the \nReligion Clauses.\u201d  NLRB v. Catholic Bishop, 440 U.S. \n490, 502 (1979).   \n2. This Court, however, should \u201cprudent[ly] exer-\ncise\u201d its jurisdiction by avoiding the need to resolve the \nweighty constitutional questions arising from the deci-\nsion below.  Bond, 572 U.S. at 855 (citation omitted).  \nBecause the decision below misconstrued the plain lan-\nguage of FUTA and the conforming Wisconsin statute, \nand because the statute\u2019s meaning is \u201cfairly include[d]\u201d \nin the question presented, FAIR, 547 U.S. at 56, the \njudgment can and should be reversed on that straight-\nforward ground.   \nEven if there were ambiguity in the text, the consti-\ntutional infirmities and concerns described above and in \npetitioners\u2019 brief (at 24-50) would provide powerful rea-\nsons to adopt our statutory interpretation as a matter \nof constitutional avoidance.  When faced with ambigu-\nous language, this Court may \u201cchoose between compet-\ning plausible interpretations of a statutory text,\u201d Jen-\nnings v. Rodriguez, 583 U.S. 281, 298 (2018) (brackets, \ncitation, and emphasis omitted), based \u201con the reasona-\n\n33 \n \nble presumption that Congress did not intend the alter-\nnative which raises serious constitutional doubts,\u201d Clark \nv. Martinez, 543 U.S. 371, 381 (2005).  Our reading \u201cis \nat least \u2018fairly possible,\u2019\u200a\u201d such that \u201cthe canon of consti-\ntutional avoidance would still counsel [the Court] to \nadopt it.\u201d  United States v. Hansen, 599 U.S. 762, 781 \n(2023) (citation omitted).   \nThis Court has previously explained that FUTA\u2019s ex-\nemption should be construed to \u201cavoid raising doubts of \nits constitutionality.\u201d  St. Martin, 451 U.S. at 780.  In \nSt. Martin, two church-run schools sought tax exemp-\ntions \u201con both statutory and First Amendment grounds.\u201d  \nId. at 774.  The schools argued that they were exempt \nbecause their employees performed services \u201cin the em-\nploy of  * * *  a church or convention or association of \nchurches,\u201d 26 U.S.C. 3309(b)(1)(A), and that \u201cholding \nthem subject to [unemployment] taxes would violate \nboth the Free Exercise Clause and the Establishment \nClause.\u201d  St. Martin, 451 U.S. at 775-776.  The Court \nfound it \u201cunnecessary\u201d to \u201cconsider the First Amend-\nment issues,\u201d id. at 788, because the statutory text could \nbe interpreted \u201cto apply to schools, like petitioners\u2019, \nthat have no separate legal existence from a church [or]  \n* * *  a \u2018convention or association of churches,\u2019\u200a\u201d id. at \n784 (quoting 26 U.S.C. 3309(b)(1)(A)).  \nA parallel course is warranted here.  Our interpreta-\ntion is not only the best construction of the statute, but \nit also avoids the need to decide whether the statute \nwould be constitutional as interpreted and applied by \nthe state supreme court.  \nC. Petitioners Qualify For The Exemption They Seek \nProperly understood, FUTA and Wisconsin\u2019s statute \nmake clear that petitioners are organizations \u201coperated \n\n34 \n \nprimarily for religious purposes\u201d and thus entitled to \nthe exemption.   \nFirst, it is undisputed that petitioners have sincerely \nheld \u201creligious purposes,\u201d 26 U.S.C. 3309(b)(1)(B); Wis. \nStat. \u00a7 108.02(15)(h)2, and that their assertions of \u201cre-\nligiosity\u201d are \u201cauthentic,\u201d Cutter, 544 U.S. at 725 n.13.  \nThe decision below \u201caccept[ed]\u201d that petitioners have a \n\u201creligious motivation\u201d and emphasized that respond-\nents \u201cdo[] not argue that [petitioners\u2019] assertions of re-\nligious motivation are insincere, fraudulent, or other-\nwise not credible.\u201d  Pet. App. 29a.   \nSecond, petitioners\u2019 religious motivations predomi-\nnate in their operations.  See Pet. Br. 6-11.  Petitioner \nCatholic Charities Bureau, for example, holds itself and \nits activities out as religiously motivated.  Its president \nis the diocesan bishop, who appoints the \u201cmembership\u201d \nthat \u201c\u200a\u2018provide[s] essential oversight to ensure the ful-\nfillment of the mission of Catholic Charities Bureau in \ncompliance with the Principles of Catholic social teach-\ning.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Pet. App. 7a-8a.  Its statement of philosophy \u201cin-\ndicates\u201d that \u201cits \u2018purpose  . . .  is to be an effective sign \nof the charity of Christ\u2019\u200a\u201d by, among other things, \u201c\u200a\u2018pro-\nviding services to the poor and disadvantaged\u2019\u200a\u201d that are \n\u201cnot duplicative of services provided by other agencies.\u201d  \nId. at 7a; see Duquesne Univ., 947 F.3d at 832 (consid-\nering whether an organization \u201cholds itself out to the \npublic as a religious institution\u201d).  The entity\u2019s code of \nethics likewise \u201csets forth the expectation that \u2018Catholic \nCharities will in its activities and actions reflect gospel \nvalues and will be consistent with its mission and the \nmission of the Diocese of Superior.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Pet. App. 8a.  And \nthere is no dispute that petitioners and their employees \nare instructed to follow Catholic social teaching in pro-\nviding services.  Ibid.; see id. at 7a, 371a-385a, 469a-\n\n35 \n \n475a.  Nor is there any suggestion that petitioners\u2019 \n\u201ccharter provisions,\u201d bylaws, statements, or conduct be-\ntray a non-exempt motivation such as a \u201ccommercial \npurpose.\u201d  Better Business Bureau, 326 U.S. at 283-284; \nsee, e.g., Living Faith, 950 F.2d at 372.  In short, the \nonly barrier to petitioners\u2019 entitlement to the exemption \nthey seek is the state court\u2019s erroneous statutory inter-\npretation.  \nCONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the Wis-\nconsin Supreme Court should be reversed.  \nRespectfully submitted. \n \n \nCURTIS E.

          "task_beliefs": "My predictive model of this case continues to solidify, with the core legal conflict now clearly defined by the competing briefs. My foundational understanding is stable: Catholic Charities Bureau (CCB) was denied a Wisconsin unemployment tax exemption after the state determined its religiously motivated social services were not \"operated primarily for religious purposes.\" The central question is whether this state-defined test violates the First Amendment.\n\nMy model incorporates the two primary, competing frames of the case:\n1.  **Petitioner's Frame (CCB):** The denial is unconstitutional religious discrimination. Their argument, which I assess as highly resonant with the current Court's jurisprudence, rests on three pillars: Church Autonomy (*Hosanna-Tabor*), Excessive Entanglement, and, most powerfully, Free Exercise violations under the logic of *Carson v. Makin* and *Fulton v. City of Philadelphia*. They argue that penalizing a religious group for expressing its faith through service rather than overt worship is a penalty based on religious character.\n2.  **Respondent's Frame (Wisconsin):** The denial is a permissible tailoring of a specific religious accommodation. Wisconsin's sophisticated counter-argument is that the exemption is not a general benefit but a targeted tool to avoid government entanglement in doctrinal employment disputes. They defend their \"religious purposes\" test as an objective, functional way to limit the exemption to this purpose, analogizing it to the Court's own functional test in ministerial exception cases. They argue *Carson* and *Fulton* are inapplicable as those cases involved secular/religious distinctions, not permissible line-drawing *among* religious organizations.\n\nMy prediction remains a firm victory for CCB, likely on Free Exercise grounds. The state's attempt to distinguish *Carson* seems particularly fragile, as the Court's majority is likely to perceive any state inquiry into *how* a group is religious as a form of impermissible discrimination and entanglement.\n\nThe latest observation has not changed this core prediction but has crucially refined my understanding of the remaining uncertainty and the key actors. The primary uncertainty is no longer the binary outcome (win/loss) but has shifted to the *scope and reasoning* of the Court's eventual opinion. A significant new piece of information is the confirmed, active involvement of the United States Solicitor General (SG). The fact that Wisconsin's brief explicitly argues against the \"United States' interpretation\" confirms that the SG has filed an amicus brief and that its position is already a central point of contention. This elevates the SG from a potential influencer to a key player whose proposed legal framework could heavily influence the final opinion, particularly whether the Court issues a narrow ruling against Wisconsin's specific test or a broad one that reshapes religious exemption law. My model now includes the SG's position as a critical variable for predicting the Court's reasoning.",
          "design_beliefs": "My methodological framework for legal prediction is becoming more robust and layered with each observation. The core principles have been validated and are now being supplemented by more advanced heuristics for navigating the later stages of a case.\n\n1.  **Source Prioritization Heuristic (Multi-Stage):** This principle has evolved from a simple two-stage model. It is now a dynamic, multi-stage process:\n    *   **Stage 1 (Pre-Grant):** The Petition for Certiorari is the highest-value source for initial case modeling.\n    *   **Stage 2 (Post-Grant Core Arguments):** The Petitioner's and Respondent's Merits Briefs are essential for defining the primary legal conflict and building a baseline prediction.\n    *   **Stage 3 (Refinement and Influence):** After the core arguments are known, the priority shifts to documents that refine the prediction and model influence. This observation confirms that the highest-value sources in this stage are the Petitioner's Reply Brief and, crucially, amicus briefs from uniquely influential parties.\n\n2.  **Contextual Analysis via Precedent Mapping:** This remains a cornerstone. The exercise of mapping both the petitioner's arguments and the respondent's counter-arguments to precedent is critical for understanding the strategic legal landscape.\n\n3.  **Legal Briefs as Strategic Data:** I continue to view briefs as rich strategic documents. The \"Table of Authorities\" is a strategic blueprint, and the choice of arguments reveals perceived vulnerabilities. The respondent's brief is the essential stress test for the initial prediction.\n\n4.  **Search Strategy Resilience:** The iterative, keyword-based search strategy is a proven and reliable method for acquiring the necessary documents as a case progresses.\n\n5.  **Systematic Uncertainty Reduction (Validated and Reinforced):** The `Assess -> Identify -> Target` loop is the engine of my design. This observation is a perfect example of its efficacy: I assessed my knowledge after digesting the primary briefs, identified that the key uncertainty had shifted from *outcome* to *scope/reasoning*, and targeted the Solicitor General's brief as the next document with the highest expected information gain to reduce this specific uncertainty.\n\n6.  **The \"Reframing\" Heuristic (Validated):** Identifying the competing frames presented by the litigants (\"religious discrimination\" vs. \"permissible accommodation tailoring\") remains a powerful predictive tool. The litigant who persuades the Court to adopt their frame of the issue is in a dominant position.\n\n7.  **The \"Influential Amicus\" Heuristic (New Principle):** While many amicus briefs are filed, some carry vastly more weight. This observation solidifies a new principle: **The amicus brief of the Solicitor General of the United States must be treated as a top-priority, Stage 3 document.** The SG's office is often referred to as the \"tenth justice\" due to its influence and expertise. Its arguments provide a strong signal about a potential path the Court might take, and its involvement can shape the entire tenor of a case.\n\n8.  **Cross-Brief Signal Analysis (New Principle):** This is a more sophisticated method of information gathering. One should not only read a brief for its own arguments but also for signals about other important documents. My realization that the SG's brief was central came from observing that the *respondent's brief* dedicated space to refuting it. This technique\u2014using one document as a guide to the information value of another\u2014is a powerful way to navigate the complex web of legal filings and dynamically update source prioritization."

My predictive model has been significantly updated. The core prediction of a victory for Catholic Charities Bureau (CCB) is now held with very high confidence. The primary uncertainty has shifted from *if* CCB will win to *how* they will win. The SG's brief introduced a powerful statutory interpretation argument that serves as an 'off-ramp' for the Court, allowing it to reverse the Wisconsin Supreme Court on narrow grounds without issuing a sweeping First Amendment ruling. This has validated my 'Influential Amicus' heuristic and led to the development of a new 'Off-Ramp' heuristic for my design model (D). The key remaining piece of the puzzle is to see how the petitioners react to this new landscape. Their reply brief is their final opportunity to frame the issues for the Court, and it will reveal whether they embrace the SG's narrow statutory path or double down on their request for a broad constitutional holding. This information is critical for refining my prediction about the scope and reasoning of the final opinion (\u03b8) and for understanding how litigants strategically respond to the SG's intervention (D).

The minimal Design EIG (0.1) reflects the value in explicitly demonstrating the 'Assess -> Identify -> Target' loop and articulating the strategic importance of a reply brief in this specific context, which refines the agent's procedural knowledge.

          "task_beliefs": "My predictive model for this case has been significantly sharpened and reinforced by the Solicitor General's (SG) amicus brief. My core prediction of a victory for Catholic Charities Bureau (CCB) is now held with very high confidence, but my understanding of the likely judicial reasoning has become much more nuanced.\n\nMy foundational model remains stable: CCB, a religious social ministry, was denied a state unemployment tax exemption because Wisconsin determined its activities were not \"operated primarily for religious purposes.\" The case pits CCB's \"religious discrimination\" frame (*Carson*, *Fulton*) against Wisconsin's \"permissible accommodation tailoring\" frame.\n\nThe observation of the SG's brief, filed in support of the petitioners, provides a critical new variable and a highly plausible path to victory for CCB. My model now incorporates three potential grounds for the Court's decision:\n1.  **Broad Free Exercise Ruling (CCB's preferred path):** The Court could adopt CCB's argument that any state test delving into *how* a religious group practices its faith is a form of status-based discrimination that violates the Free Exercise Clause under the logic of *Carson v. Makin*. This would be a major, expansive ruling on religious liberty.\n2.  **Narrow Statutory Ruling (The SG's \"Off-Ramp\"):** The SG's primary argument is that the Wisconsin Supreme Court simply misinterpreted the law. Because the Wisconsin statute (Wis. Stat. \u00a7 108.02(15)(h)2) was enacted to conform with the Federal Unemployment Tax Act (FUTA, 26 U.S.C. 3309(b)(1)(B)), it must be interpreted consistently. The SG argues the phrase \"operated primarily for religious purposes\" refers to the organization's sincere *motivations and reasons* for operating, not an objective analysis of whether its *activities* are \"inherently religious.\" The Court could adopt this reasoning to reverse the Wisconsin court on narrow statutory grounds, avoiding a major constitutional pronouncement.\n3.  **Constitutional Avoidance Ruling (The SG's alternative path):** The SG also argues that if the statute *is* ambiguous, the Court should reject the Wisconsin court's interpretation to avoid the serious constitutional problems (excessive entanglement, Free Exercise violations) it creates. This bridges the statutory and constitutional arguments.\n\nThe SG's brief elevates the statutory interpretation issue from a secondary point to a potential dispositive ground for the decision. This \"off-ramp\" is likely to be attractive to justices who may be sympathetic to CCB but wary of issuing another sweeping constitutional rule on religion. My prediction is still a firm win for CCB, but the central uncertainty has now evolved from *if* they will win to *how narrow* the opinion will be. The probability that the Court will choose the SG's narrower statutory path over a broad Free Exercise ruling has increased substantially.",
          "design_beliefs": "My methodological framework continues to evolve, with this observation providing strong validation for recently developed heuristics and suggesting new ones for analyzing the strategic dynamics of Supreme Court litigation.\n\n1.  **Source Prioritization Heuristic (Multi-Stage):** This model is robust. The SG brief is the archetypal **Stage 3 (Refinement and Influence)** document. Its value lies not in repeating known arguments, but in introducing a novel, credible, and potentially decisive legal framework that can sway the Court's reasoning.\n2.  **Contextual Analysis via Precedent Mapping:** This remains essential. The SG's brief adds a new branch to the precedent map, focusing on cases of statutory interpretation where state and federal laws are intertwined (*St. Martin v. South Dakota*) and the canon of constitutional avoidance (*NLRB v. Catholic Bishop*).\n3.  **Legal Briefs as Strategic Data:** This principle is reinforced. The SG brief's structure\u2014leading with the narrow statutory argument before the broader constitutional one\u2014is a key piece of strategic data. It signals a deliberate attempt to provide the Court with multiple paths to the same outcome, increasing the overall probability of success.\n4.  **Search Strategy Resilience:** The keyword-based search strategy remains effective for targeted document acquisition.\n5.  **Systematic Uncertainty Reduction:** The `Assess -> Identify -> Target` loop has once again proven its value. Assessing the briefs led me to identify the SG's role as a key uncertainty, and targeting that brief directly addressed that uncertainty, revealing the crucial \"statutory off-ramp\" argument.\n6.  **The \"Reframing\" Heuristic:** This remains a core predictive tool. The SG's brief offers a third frame: this case is about a simple \"statutory misinterpretation\" of a federal scheme, which is less contentious than either \"discrimination\" or \"accommodation tailoring.\"\n7.  **The \"Influential Amicus\" Heuristic (Strongly Validated):** This new principle is now a cornerstone of my methodology. The SG's brief is not merely additive; it is transformative. It has fundamentally altered the landscape of potential outcomes by providing a clear, non-constitutional basis for a decision. The brief from the \"tenth justice\" must always be prioritized and analyzed for its potential to define the Court's path.\n8.  **Cross-Brief Signal Analysis (Strongly Validated):** My prior inference\u2014that the respondent's focus on refuting the \"United States' interpretation\" signaled the high importance of the SG's brief\u2014was entirely correct. This confirms that analyzing how litigants engage with *other* filings is a powerful method for dynamically prioritizing information gathering.\n9.  **The \"Off-Ramp\" Heuristic (New Principle):** This observation prompts a new heuristic. Influential briefs, particularly from the SG, should be scrutinized for arguments that provide the Court a narrow, less controversial basis for a decision (an \"off-ramp\"). A statutory, procedural, or otherwise non-constitutional ground for deciding a case that would otherwise require a major constitutional ruling is often highly attractive to the Court, especially to its median or institutionalist justices. Identifying these off-ramps is critical for accurately predicting the *scope* and *reasoning* of the final opinion, not just the binary outcome."

Specifically, can \nWisconsin disqualify Catholic Charities from an oth-\nerwise-available tax exemption because, in keeping \nwith Catholic teaching, it hires both Catholics and \nnon-Catholics, helps both Catholics and non-Catho-\nlics, and does not proselytize those it serves? As we ex-\nplain below, the Constitution says no. \nLike many other states, and consistent with the \nFederal Unemployment Tax Act, 26 U.S.C. 3309, Wis-\nconsin exempts certain \u201cchurches\u201d and religious \u201cnon-\nprofit organizations\u201d from paying taxes into the state\u2019s \nunemployment compensation system. Wis. Stat. \n\u00a7 108.02(15)(h). For example, Wisconsin exempts the \nDiocese of Superior, a Roman Catholic diocese, from \nthe unemployment compensation tax because it is a \nchurch.  \nBut Wisconsin refuses to extend an exemption to \nthe Diocese of Superior\u2019s separately incorporated char-\nitable ministry arm, Catholic Charities. That is be-\ncause under Wisconsin law, as definitively interpreted \nby the Wisconsin Supreme Court, Catholic Charities \nmust show that its activities are sufficiently similar \n\u201cin nature\u201d to whatever the state determines to be \n\u201ctypical\u201d religious activities. Pet.App.26a-27a, 29a. \nAnd in the Wisconsin Supreme Court\u2019s view, Catholic \nCharities\u2019 ministry \u201cto individuals with developmental \nand mental health disabilities\u201d is not religious activity \nat all but is instead \u201cprimarily charitable and secular.\u201d \nPet.App.30a. Indeed, for the Wisconsin Supreme \nCourt, the \u201cCatholic\u201d in \u201cCatholic Charities\u201d is entirely \n\n2 \n \nsuperfluous because services to the disabled \u201ccan be \nprovided by organizations of either religious or secular \nmotivations, and the services provided would not dif-\nfer in any sense.\u201d Pet.App.30a. \nAlso important\u2014according to the Wisconsin Su-\npreme Court\u2014is what Catholic Charities does not do: \n\u201cattempt to imbue program participants with the \nCatholic faith [or] supply any religious materials to \nprogram participants or employees.\u201d Pet.App.29a. If \nCatholic Charities were to proselytize those it serves, \nrefuse to help non-Catholics, or refuse to hire non-\nCatholics, then its activities might fit the stereotypes \nof religion the Wisconsin Supreme Court relies on. But \nbecause Catholic Charities\u2019 religious beliefs do not al-\nlow it to conform to those stereotypes, its ministry is \nnot \u201creligious in nature\u201d and it thus flunks the test for \nobtaining a religious exemption.  \nThis is therefore a simple case. Wisconsin has de-\nnied Catholic Charities a religious exemption that the \nstate freely extends to other religious organizations \nbased on the absurd view that Catholic Charities\u2019 aid \nto the needy isn\u2019t actually religious at all. The Religion \nClauses of the First Amendment do not allow such a \nremarkable conclusion. Instead, the Clauses work in \ntandem to protect a sphere of autonomy for religious \norganizations, to prevent entanglement of church and \nstate, and to prohibit government discrimination \namong religious organizations. Wisconsin\u2019s effort to \npick and choose among religious groups\u2014and carve \nout works of mercy from the realm of the \u201creligious\u201d \naltogether\u2014thus violates the Constitution three times \nover.  \n\n3 \n \nOPINIONS BELOW \nThe decision of the Supreme Court of Wisconsin \n(Pet.App.1a-124a) is reported at 3 N.W.3d 666. The de-\ncision of the Court of Appeals of Wisconsin \n(Pet.App.125a-168a) is reported at 987 N.W.2d 778. \nThe decision of the Court of Appeals of Wisconsin cer-\ntifying this appeal to the Supreme Court of Wisconsin \n(Pet.App.169a-188a) is not reported. The decision of \nthe Douglas County Circuit Court (Pet.App.189a-\n211a) is not reported. \nJURISDICTION \nThis Court has jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \n1257(a). \nCONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY \nPROVISIONS INVOLVED \nThe First Amendment to the United States Consti-\ntution provides that \u201cCongress shall make no law re-\nspecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting \nthe \nfree \nexercise \nthereof  * * *  .\u201d \nU.S. \nConst. \nAmend. I. \nThe Federal Unemployment Tax Act states in rele-\nvant part: \n(b) This section shall not apply to service per-\nformed\u2014 \n(1) in the employ of (A) a church or convention or \nassociation of churches, (B) an organization \nwhich is operated primarily for religious pur-\nposes and which is operated, supervised, con-\ntrolled, or principally supported by a church or \nconvention or association of churches, or (C) an \nelementary or secondary school which is oper-\nated primarily for religious purposes, which is \n\n4 \n \ndescribed in section 501(c)(3), and which is ex-\nempt from tax under section 501(a). \n26 U.S.C. 3309(b)(1). \nWisconsin\u2019s Unemployment Insurance and Re-\nserves law states in relevant part: \n(h) \u201cEmployment\u201d as applied to work for a non-\nprofit organization  * * *  does not include ser-\nvice: \n1. In the employ of a church or convention or \nassociation of churches; [or] \n2. In the employ of an organization operated \nprimarily for religious purposes and oper-\nated, supervised, controlled, or principally \nsupported by a church or convention or asso-\nciation of churches;  \nWis. Stat. \u00a7 108.02(15)(h)(1)-(2). \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nA. The Federal Unemployment Tax Act and \nthe religious purposes exemption \nThe Federal Unemployment Tax Act (FUTA), 26 \nU.S.C. 3301-3311 \u201ccall[s] for a cooperative federal-\nstate program of benefits to unemployed workers.\u201d St. \nMartin Evangelical Lutheran Church v. South Dakota, \n451 U.S. 772, 775 (1981). As part of this cooperative \nsystem, employers pay the federal government a per-\ncentage of their employees\u2019 annual wages to fund job \nservice programs, to support state unemployment \nagencies (in times of high unemployment), and to sup-\nport a federally administered fund against which \nstates may borrow to pay unemployment benefits. But \nthese employers can claim a credit of up to 90% of this \n\n5 \n \nfederal tax for \u201ccontributions\u201d they have made to fed-\nerally approved state unemployment compensation \nprograms (which provide benefits directly to unem-\nployed workers), thus reducing the amount of money \nthose employers owe to the federal government and re-\nducing their overall tax burden. Id. at 775 n.3; 26 \nU.S.C. 3302(a)(1). \nTo allow their employers to take advantage of the \nfederal tax credit, all states (including Wisconsin) \nhave complementary statutes, which the Secretary of \nLabor reviews and annually certifies as compliant \nwith FUTA\u2019s requirements. See 26 U.S.C. 3304(a), (b). \nThese complementary statutes must impose, at a min-\nimum, the same level of coverage mandated by FUTA. \nSee Wimberly v. Labor & Indus. Rels. Comm\u2019n of Mo., \n479 U.S. 511, 514 (1987) (\u201cThe Act establishes certain \nminimum federal standards that a State must satisfy \nin order for a State to participate in the program.\u201d); \nSt. Martin\u00b8 451 U.S. at 775 n.3 (similar).  \nFUTA contains a religious exemption that narrows \nthe scope of the law\u2019s mandatory coverage require-\nments in three circumstances. First, the law exempts \nany \u201cchurch or convention or association of churches.\u201d \n26 U.S.C. 3309(b)(1)(A). Second, the law exempts any \nnonprofit \u201coperated primarily for religious purposes,\u201d \nbut only if also \u201coperated, supervised, controlled, or \nprincipally supported by a church or convention or as-\nsociation of churches.\u201d 26 U.S.C. 3309(b)(1)(B). Third, \nthe law exempts religious schools that are \u201coperated \nprimarily for religious purposes\u201d and are federally tax-\nexempt under 26 U.S.C. 501(c)(3). 26 U.S.C. \n3309(b)(1)(C).  \n\n6 \n \nTwice before, this Court considered constitutional \nclaims challenging the scope of FUTA\u2019s \u201creligious pur-\nposes\u201d exemption but resolved both cases on alterna-\ntive grounds. St. Martin, 451 U.S. at 788 (holding reli-\ngious school plaintiffs were exempt from South Da-\nkota\u2019s \nunemployment \ntax \nunder \n26 \nU.S.C. \n3309(b)(1)(A)); California v. Grace Brethren Church, \n457 U.S. 393, 417 (1982) (holding the Tax Injunction \nAct prohibited a federal district court from entering \ndeclaratory relief).  \nToday, forty-seven states have adopted language \nidentical, or nearly identical, to FUTA\u2019s exclusion of \nnonprofits \u201coperated primarily for religious purposes.\u201d \nSee Pet.6 n.1. Wisconsin thus requires nonprofits \nwhich meet certain minimum qualifications to pay \ninto its state unemployment program, Wis. Stat. \n\u00a7 108.02(13)(b), while exempting nonprofits \u201coperated \nprimarily for religious purposes\u201d under Wis. Stat. \n\u00a7 108.02(15)(h)(2), a provision nearly identical to \nFUTA\u2019s exemption.1  \nB. Catholic \nCharities \nand \nits \nreligious \nmission \nPetitioner Catholic Charities Bureau is a Wiscon-\nsin nonprofit corporation and the social ministry arm \nof the Diocese of Superior, a diocese of the Roman \nCatholic Church comprised of over 75,000 Catholics \nstretching over 15,000 square miles of northern Wis-\nconsin. Pet.App.371a. Its mission is \u201c[t]o carry on the \nredeeming work of our Lord by reflecting gospel values \nand the moral teaching of the church.\u201d Pet.App.382a, \n \n1  \nThe only differences\u2014the omission of two instances of the \nwords \u201cwhich is\u201d\u2014are immaterial. Compare Wis. Stat. \n\u00a7 108.02(15)(h)(2) with 26 U.S.C. 3309(b)(1)(B). \n\n7 \n \n428a. Since 1917, Catholic Charities has carried out \nthis mission by \u201cproviding services to the poor and dis-\nadvantaged as an expression of the social ministry of \nthe Catholic Church.\u201d Pet.App.383a, 431a. Its \u201cpur-\npose  * * *  is to be an effective sign of the charity of \nChrist\u201d by providing services without making distinc-\ntions \u201cby race, sex, or religion.\u201d Pet.App.383a, 431a. \nCatholic Charities views this ministry as a mandate of \nCatholic social teaching and a primary tenet of the \nfaith. Pet.App.373a-379a. And Catholic Charities \npledges that it \u201cwill in its activities and actions reflect \ngospel values and will be consistent with its mission \nand the mission of the Diocese of Superior.\u201d \nPet.App.384a, 429a.  \nCatholic Charities fulfills this mission by carrying \nout a wide variety of ministries for the elderly, the dis-\nabled, the poor, and those in need of disaster relief. \nPet.App.372a-373a. From offering shelter to the el-\nderly poor and those suffering from chronic mental or \nphysical illnesses to ministering to the sick in their \nhomes, Catholic Charities shares the love of Christ \nwith \u201cmore than 10,500 people\u201d each year. J.A.120. \nSee, e.g., J.A.103-104, 113-117, 152-153, 169-171, 181-\n182.  \nCatholic Charities is separately incorporated from \nthe Diocese of Superior and, like the Diocese, has \n501(c)(3) status under the Roman Catholic Church\u2019s \ngroup tax exemption. Pet.App.386a-402a. Catholic \nCharities was organized in this way to accord with \nCatholic teaching on subsidiarity. J.A.200, 208. As one \nof the seven principles of Catholic social teaching, sub-\nsidiarity instructs that it is an \u201cinjustice  * * *  and \ndisturbance of right order to assign to a greater and \n\n8 \n \nhigher association what lesser and subordinate organ-\nizations can do.\u201d Pontifical Council for Justice and \nPeace, Compendium of the Social Doctrine of the \nChurch \u00b6 186 (2004) (quoting Pope Pius XI, Quadra-\ngesimo Anno \u00b6 79 (1931)). This principle allows \u201cinter-\nmediate social entities [to] properly perform the func-\ntions that fall to them without being required to hand \nthem over unjustly to other social entities of a higher \nlevel, by which they would end up being absorbed and \nsubstituted.\u201d Ibid.; Pope Benedict XVI, Deus Caritas \nEst \u00b6 31 (2005) (\u201cThe increase in diversified organiza-\ntions engaged in meeting various human needs is ulti-\nmately due to the fact that the command of love of \nneighbour is inscribed by the Creator in man\u2019s very \nnature.\u201d). \nIn keeping with this principle, Catholic Charities \nalso oversees several separately incorporated sub-en-\ntities that help it carry out various aspects of its min-\nistry in local communities across a wide area of rural \nnorthern Wisconsin. These include Petitioners Head-\nwaters, Barron County Developmental Services, Di-\nversified Services, and Black River Industries. \nPet.App.128a-130a. For example, Barron County De-\nvelopmental Services helps the disabled in Barron \nCounty, which is in a part of the Diocese located over \n100 miles south of the Diocese\u2019s seat in Superior. \nThe Bishop of the Diocese of Superior has plenary \ncontrol over Catholic Charities: He \u201coversees CCB in \nits entirety, including its sub-entities.\u201d Pet.App.7a-8a, \n130a. He serves as president of Catholic Charities and \nappoints its \u201cmembership,\u201d which consists of the \nbishop himself, the vicar general of the Diocese of Su-\nperior, and the Executive Director of Catholic Chari-\nties. Pet.App.7a, 415a-417a. The bishop also appoints \n\n9 \n \nthe board of directors of Catholic Charities, which help \nadvise Catholic Charities\u2019 membership. Pet.App.419a-\n421a. \nCatholic Charities\u2019 membership oversees the entire \nministry to ensure fulfillment of Catholic Charities\u2019 \nmission in compliance with Catholic social teaching. \nPet.App.28a-29a, 416a-417a. This includes the minis-\ntries of Catholic Charities\u2019 sub-entities. Each sub-en-\ntity signs Catholic Charities\u2019 Guiding Principles of \nCorporate Affiliation, which gives Catholic Charities \nultimate responsibility for ensuring the sub-entities \nremain \nfaithful \nto \ntheir \nCatholic \nmission. \nPet.App.422a-425a. And each sub-entity is directed to \ncomply fully with Catholic social teaching in providing \nservices. Pet.App.8a, 425a. All new key staff and direc-\ntor-level positions receive a manual entitled The So-\ncial Ministry of Catholic Charities Bureau in the Dio-\ncese of Superior, which they must review during orien-\ntation. Pet.App.371a-385a. In addition, every new em-\nployee receives a welcome letter with Catholic Chari-\nties\u2019 mission statement, code of ethics, and statement \n\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

Specifically, can \nWisconsin disqualify Catholic Charities from an oth-\nerwise-available tax exemption because, in keeping \nwith Catholic teaching, it hires both Catholics and \nnon-Catholics, helps both Catholics and non-Catho-\nlics, and does not proselytize those it serves? As we ex-\nplain below, the Constitution says no. \nLike many other states, and consistent with the \nFederal Unemployment Tax Act, 26 U.S.C. 3309, Wis-\nconsin exempts certain \u201cchurches\u201d and religious \u201cnon-\nprofit organizations\u201d from paying taxes into the state\u2019s \nunemployment compensation system. Wis. Stat. \n\u00a7 108.02(15)(h). For example, Wisconsin exempts the \nDiocese of Superior, a Roman Catholic diocese, from \nthe unemployment compensation tax because it is a \nchurch.  \nBut Wisconsin refuses to extend an exemption to \nthe Diocese of Superior\u2019s separately incorporated char-\nitable ministry arm, Catholic Charities. That is be-\ncause under Wisconsin law, as definitively interpreted \nby the Wisconsin Supreme Court, Catholic Charities \nmust show that its activities are sufficiently similar \n\u201cin nature\u201d to whatever the state determines to be \n\u201ctypical\u201d religious activities. Pet.App.26a-27a, 29a. \nAnd in the Wisconsin Supreme Court\u2019s view, Catholic \nCharities\u2019 ministry \u201cto individuals with developmental \nand mental health disabilities\u201d is not religious activity \nat all but is instead \u201cprimarily charitable and secular.\u201d \nPet.App.30a. Indeed, for the Wisconsin Supreme \nCourt, the \u201cCatholic\u201d in \u201cCatholic Charities\u201d is entirely \n\n2 \n \nsuperfluous because services to the disabled \u201ccan be \nprovided by organizations of either religious or secular \nmotivations, and the services provided would not dif-\nfer in any sense.\u201d Pet.App.30a. \nAlso important\u2014according to the Wisconsin Su-\npreme Court\u2014is what Catholic Charities does not do: \n\u201cattempt to imbue program participants with the \nCatholic faith [or] supply any religious materials to \nprogram participants or employees.\u201d Pet.App.29a. If \nCatholic Charities were to proselytize those it serves, \nrefuse to help non-Catholics, or refuse to hire non-\nCatholics, then its activities might fit the stereotypes \nof religion the Wisconsin Supreme Court relies on. But \nbecause Catholic Charities\u2019 religious beliefs do not al-\nlow it to conform to those stereotypes, its ministry is \nnot \u201creligious in nature\u201d and it thus flunks the test for \nobtaining a religious exemption.  \nThis is therefore a simple case. Wisconsin has de-\nnied Catholic Charities a religious exemption that the \nstate freely extends to other religious organizations \nbased on the absurd view that Catholic Charities\u2019 aid \nto the needy isn\u2019t actually religious at all. The Religion \nClauses of the First Amendment do not allow such a \nremarkable conclusion. Instead, the Clauses work in \ntandem to protect a sphere of autonomy for religious \norganizations, to prevent entanglement of church and \nstate, and to prohibit government discrimination \namong religious organizations. Wisconsin\u2019s effort to \npick and choose among religious groups\u2014and carve \nout works of mercy from the realm of the \u201creligious\u201d \naltogether\u2014thus violates the Constitution three times \nover.  \n\n3 \n \nOPINIONS BELOW \nThe decision of the Supreme Court of Wisconsin \n(Pet.App.1a-124a) is reported at 3 N.W.3d 666. The de-\ncision of the Court of Appeals of Wisconsin \n(Pet.App.125a-168a) is reported at 987 N.W.2d 778. \nThe decision of the Court of Appeals of Wisconsin cer-\ntifying this appeal to the Supreme Court of Wisconsin \n(Pet.App.169a-188a) is not reported. The decision of \nthe Douglas County Circuit Court (Pet.App.189a-\n211a) is not reported. \nJURISDICTION \nThis Court has jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \n1257(a). \nCONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY \nPROVISIONS INVOLVED \nThe First Amendment to the United States Consti-\ntution provides that \u201cCongress shall make no law re-\nspecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting \nthe \nfree \nexercise \nthereof  * * *  .\u201d \nU.S. \nConst. \nAmend. I. \nThe Federal Unemployment Tax Act states in rele-\nvant part: \n(b) This section shall not apply to service per-\nformed\u2014 \n(1) in the employ of (A) a church or convention or \nassociation of churches, (B) an organization \nwhich is operated primarily for religious pur-\nposes and which is operated, supervised, con-\ntrolled, or principally supported by a church or \nconvention or association of churches, or (C) an \nelementary or secondary school which is oper-\nated primarily for religious purposes, which is \n\n4 \n \ndescribed in section 501(c)(3), and which is ex-\nempt from tax under section 501(a). \n26 U.S.C. 3309(b)(1). \nWisconsin\u2019s Unemployment Insurance and Re-\nserves law states in relevant part: \n(h) \u201cEmployment\u201d as applied to work for a non-\nprofit organization  * * *  does not include ser-\nvice: \n1. In the employ of a church or convention or \nassociation of churches; [or] \n2. In the employ of an organization operated \nprimarily for religious purposes and oper-\nated, supervised, controlled, or principally \nsupported by a church or convention or asso-\nciation of churches;  \nWis. Stat. \u00a7 108.02(15)(h)(1)-(2). \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nA. The Federal Unemployment Tax Act and \nthe religious purposes exemption \nThe Federal Unemployment Tax Act (FUTA), 26 \nU.S.C. 3301-3311 \u201ccall[s] for a cooperative federal-\nstate program of benefits to unemployed workers.\u201d St. \nMartin Evangelical Lutheran Church v. South Dakota, \n451 U.S. 772, 775 (1981). As part of this cooperative \nsystem, employers pay the federal government a per-\ncentage of their employees\u2019 annual wages to fund job \nservice programs, to support state unemployment \nagencies (in times of high unemployment), and to sup-\nport a federally administered fund against which \nstates may borrow to pay unemployment benefits. But \nthese employers can claim a credit of up to 90% of this \n\n5 \n \nfederal tax for \u201ccontributions\u201d they have made to fed-\nerally approved state unemployment compensation \nprograms (which provide benefits directly to unem-\nployed workers), thus reducing the amount of money \nthose employers owe to the federal government and re-\nducing their overall tax burden. Id. at 775 n.3; 26 \nU.S.C. 3302(a)(1). \nTo allow their employers to take advantage of the \nfederal tax credit, all states (including Wisconsin) \nhave complementary statutes, which the Secretary of \nLabor reviews and annually certifies as compliant \nwith FUTA\u2019s requirements. See 26 U.S.C. 3304(a), (b). \nThese complementary statutes must impose, at a min-\nimum, the same level of coverage mandated by FUTA. \nSee Wimberly v. Labor & Indus. Rels. Comm\u2019n of Mo., \n479 U.S. 511, 514 (1987) (\u201cThe Act establishes certain \nminimum federal standards that a State must satisfy \nin order for a State to participate in the program.\u201d); \nSt. Martin\u00b8 451 U.S. at 775 n.3 (similar).  \nFUTA contains a religious exemption that narrows \nthe scope of the law\u2019s mandatory coverage require-\nments in three circumstances. First, the law exempts \nany \u201cchurch or convention or association of churches.\u201d \n26 U.S.C. 3309(b)(1)(A). Second, the law exempts any \nnonprofit \u201coperated primarily for religious purposes,\u201d \nbut only if also \u201coperated, supervised, controlled, or \nprincipally supported by a church or convention or as-\nsociation of churches.\u201d 26 U.S.C. 3309(b)(1)(B). Third, \nthe law exempts religious schools that are \u201coperated \nprimarily for religious purposes\u201d and are federally tax-\nexempt under 26 U.S.C. 501(c)(3). 26 U.S.C. \n3309(b)(1)(C).  \n\n6 \n \nTwice before, this Court considered constitutional \nclaims challenging the scope of FUTA\u2019s \u201creligious pur-\nposes\u201d exemption but resolved both cases on alterna-\ntive grounds. St. Martin, 451 U.S. at 788 (holding reli-\ngious school plaintiffs were exempt from South Da-\nkota\u2019s \nunemployment \ntax \nunder \n26 \nU.S.C. \n3309(b)(1)(A)); California v. Grace Brethren Church, \n457 U.S. 393, 417 (1982) (holding the Tax Injunction \nAct prohibited a federal district court from entering \ndeclaratory relief).  \nToday, forty-seven states have adopted language \nidentical, or nearly identical, to FUTA\u2019s exclusion of \nnonprofits \u201coperated primarily for religious purposes.\u201d \nSee Pet.6 n.1. Wisconsin thus requires nonprofits \nwhich meet certain minimum qualifications to pay \ninto its state unemployment program, Wis. Stat. \n\u00a7 108.02(13)(b), while exempting nonprofits \u201coperated \nprimarily for religious purposes\u201d under Wis. Stat. \n\u00a7 108.02(15)(h)(2), a provision nearly identical to \nFUTA\u2019s exemption.1  \nB. Catholic \nCharities \nand \nits \nreligious \nmission \nPetitioner Catholic Charities Bureau is a Wiscon-\nsin nonprofit corporation and the social ministry arm \nof the Diocese of Superior, a diocese of the Roman \nCatholic Church comprised of over 75,000 Catholics \nstretching over 15,000 square miles of northern Wis-\nconsin. Pet.App.371a. Its mission is \u201c[t]o carry on the \nredeeming work of our Lord by reflecting gospel values \nand the moral teaching of the church.\u201d Pet.App.382a, \n \n1  \nThe only differences\u2014the omission of two instances of the \nwords \u201cwhich is\u201d\u2014are immaterial. Compare Wis. Stat. \n\u00a7 108.02(15)(h)(2) with 26 U.S.C. 3309(b)(1)(B). \n\n7 \n \n428a. Since 1917, Catholic Charities has carried out \nthis mission by \u201cproviding services to the poor and dis-\nadvantaged as an expression of the social ministry of \nthe Catholic Church.\u201d Pet.App.383a, 431a. Its \u201cpur-\npose  * * *  is to be an effective sign of the charity of \nChrist\u201d by providing services without making distinc-\ntions \u201cby race, sex, or religion.\u201d Pet.App.383a, 431a. \nCatholic Charities views this ministry as a mandate of \nCatholic social teaching and a primary tenet of the \nfaith. Pet.App.373a-379a. And Catholic Charities \npledges that it \u201cwill in its activities and actions reflect \ngospel values and will be consistent with its mission \nand the mission of the Diocese of Superior.\u201d \nPet.App.384a, 429a.  \nCatholic Charities fulfills this mission by carrying \nout a wide variety of ministries for the elderly, the dis-\nabled, the poor, and those in need of disaster relief. \nPet.App.372a-373a. From offering shelter to the el-\nderly poor and those suffering from chronic mental or \nphysical illnesses to ministering to the sick in their \nhomes, Catholic Charities shares the love of Christ \nwith \u201cmore than 10,500 people\u201d each year. J.A.120. \nSee, e.g., J.A.103-104, 113-117, 152-153, 169-171, 181-\n182.  \nCatholic Charities is separately incorporated from \nthe Diocese of Superior and, like the Diocese, has \n501(c)(3) status under the Roman Catholic Church\u2019s \ngroup tax exemption. Pet.App.386a-402a. Catholic \nCharities was organized in this way to accord with \nCatholic teaching on subsidiarity. J.A.200, 208. As one \nof the seven principles of Catholic social teaching, sub-\nsidiarity instructs that it is an \u201cinjustice  * * *  and \ndisturbance of right order to assign to a greater and \n\n8 \n \nhigher association what lesser and subordinate organ-\nizations can do.\u201d Pontifical Council for Justice and \nPeace, Compendium of the Social Doctrine of the \nChurch \u00b6 186 (2004) (quoting Pope Pius XI, Quadra-\ngesimo Anno \u00b6 79 (1931)). This principle allows \u201cinter-\nmediate social entities [to] properly perform the func-\ntions that fall to them without being required to hand \nthem over unjustly to other social entities of a higher \nlevel, by which they would end up being absorbed and \nsubstituted.\u201d Ibid.; Pope Benedict XVI, Deus Caritas \nEst \u00b6 31 (2005) (\u201cThe increase in diversified organiza-\ntions engaged in meeting various human needs is ulti-\nmately due to the fact that the command of love of \nneighbour is inscribed by the Creator in man\u2019s very \nnature.\u201d). \nIn keeping with this principle, Catholic Charities \nalso oversees several separately incorporated sub-en-\ntities that help it carry out various aspects of its min-\nistry in local communities across a wide area of rural \nnorthern Wisconsin. These include Petitioners Head-\nwaters, Barron County Developmental Services, Di-\nversified Services, and Black River Industries. \nPet.App.128a-130a. For example, Barron County De-\nvelopmental Services helps the disabled in Barron \nCounty, which is in a part of the Diocese located over \n100 miles south of the Diocese\u2019s seat in Superior. \nThe Bishop of the Diocese of Superior has plenary \ncontrol over Catholic Charities: He \u201coversees CCB in \nits entirety, including its sub-entities.\u201d Pet.App.7a-8a, \n130a. He serves as president of Catholic Charities and \nappoints its \u201cmembership,\u201d which consists of the \nbishop himself, the vicar general of the Diocese of Su-\nperior, and the Executive Director of Catholic Chari-\nties. Pet.App.7a, 415a-417a. The bishop also appoints \n\n9 \n \nthe board of directors of Catholic Charities, which help \nadvise Catholic Charities\u2019 membership. Pet.App.419a-\n421a. \nCatholic Charities\u2019 membership oversees the entire \nministry to ensure fulfillment of Catholic Charities\u2019 \nmission in compliance with Catholic social teaching. \nPet.App.28a-29a, 416a-417a. This includes the minis-\ntries of Catholic Charities\u2019 sub-entities. Each sub-en-\ntity signs Catholic Charities\u2019 Guiding Principles of \nCorporate Affiliation, which gives Catholic Charities \nultimate responsibility for ensuring the sub-entities \nremain \nfaithful \nto \ntheir \nCatholic \nmission. \nPet.App.422a-425a. And each sub-entity is directed to \ncomply fully with Catholic social teaching in providing \nservices. Pet.App.8a, 425a. All new key staff and direc-\ntor-level positions receive a manual entitled The So-\ncial Ministry of Catholic Charities Bureau in the Dio-\ncese of Superior, which they must review during orien-\ntation. Pet.App.371a-385a. In addition, every new em-\nployee receives a welcome letter with Catholic Chari-\nties\u2019 mission statement, code of ethics, and statement \nof \nthe \nministry\u2019s \nphilosophy \ntoward \nservice. \nPet.App.131a, 207a, 380a-385a, 469a-475a. All em-\nployees are instructed to abide by these documents. \nPet.App.130a-131a, 207a. \nCatholic Charities\u2019 ministry is also guided by the \nprinciples of its Catholic faith. Specifically, Catholic \nteaching \u201c\u2018demand[s]\u2019 that Catholics respond in char-\nity to those in need.\u201d Pet.App.128a; see also Deus Cari-\ntas Est \u00b6 32 (\u201c[Charity] has been an essential part of \n[the Church\u2019s] mission from the very beginning.\u201d); \nJames 1:27 (RSV-CE) (\u201cReligion that is pure and un-\ndefiled before God and the Father is this: to visit or-\nphans and widows in their affliction[.]). Indeed, the \n\n10 \n \nCatholic Church \u201cclaims works of charity as its own \ninalienable duty and right.\u201d Pope Saint Paul VI, Apos-\ntolicam Actuositatem \u00b6 8 (1965); Catechism of the \nCatholic Church \u00b6 1826 (charity \u201cis the first of the the-\nological virtues\u201d); Deus Caritas Est \u00b6 25(a) (\u201cFor the \nChurch, charity is not a kind of welfare activity which \ncould equally well be left to others, but is a part of her \nnature, an indispensable expression of her very be-\ning.\u201d). To Catholic Charities, the purpose, form, and \noutworking of charity are fundamentally and inescap-\nably religious. \nCatholic teaching also confirms that the Church\u2019s \ncharitable ministry \u201cmust embrace the entire human \nrace.\u201d Compendium of the Social Doctrine of the \nChurch \u00b6 581. The Church therefore instructs that \ncharity should be exercised \u201cin an impartial manner \ntowards\u201d \u201cmembers of other religions.\u201d Congregation \nfor Bishops, Directory for the Pastoral Ministry of \nBishops \u201cApostolorum Successores\u201d \u00b6 208 (2004); Ap-\nostolicam Actuositatem \u00b6 8 (\u201c[C]haritable enterprises \ncan and should reach out to all persons and all \nneeds.\u201d). Catholic bodies may not \u201cmisus[e] works of \ncharity for purposes of proselytism.\u201d Apostolorum Suc-\ncessores \u00b6 196. As Pope Benedict XVI explained, \n\u201cThose who practise charity in the Church\u2019s name will \nnever seek to impose the Church\u2019s faith upon others.\u201d \nDeus Caritas Est \u00b6 31(c). And indeed, this same \u201cEcu-\nmenical orientation\u201d informs Catholic Charities\u2019 belief \nthat \u201cno distinctions\u201d should be made by \u201crace, sex, or \nreligion\u201d with regard to \u201cstaff employed,\u201d so that its \nministry can be \u201can effective sign of the charity of \nChrist.\u201d Pet.App.383a.   \nFor Catholic Charities and the Diocese, this is all \nunto religious ends: Serving those in need consistent \n\n11 \n \nwith the above religious teachings \u201cis the best witness \nto the God in whom we believe and by whom we are \ndriven to love.\u201d Deus Caritas Est \u00b6 31(c). For \u201c[a] \nChristian knows when it is time to speak of God and \nwhen it is better to say nothing and to let love alone \nspeak.\u201d Ibid. And thus \u201c[i]t is the responsibility of the \nChurch\u2019s charitable organizations to reinforce this \nawareness in their members, so that by their activ-\nity\u2014as well as their words, their silence, their exam-\nple\u2014they may be credible witnesses to Christ.\u201d Ibid.  \nC. Catholic Charities seeks to participate in \nthe Wisconsin bishops\u2019 unemployment \nassistance program \nFor the Catholic Church, \u201c[t]he obligation to pro-\nvide unemployment benefits  * * *  spring[s] from the \nfundamental principle of the moral order in this \nsphere.\u201d Pet.App.433a (quoting Pope Saint John Paul \nII, Laborem Exercens (1981)). Prompted by and in ac-\ncordance with this teaching, the Wisconsin bishops \ncreated the Church Unemployment Pay Program \n(CUPP) \u201cto assist parishes, schools, and other church \nemployers in meeting their social justice responsibili-\nties by providing church funded unemployment cover-\nage.\u201d Pet.App.433a.  \nCUPP has long served the needs of employees \nthroughout Wisconsin without issue. CUPP provides \nthe same maximum weekly benefit rate as the State\u2019s \nsystem. Pet.App.438a. And, in some instances, an em-\nployee may receive a higher percentage of his salary \nthan in the State\u2019s system, while often receiving bene-\nfits more quickly. Compare ibid. (\u201c50% of the em-\nployee\u2019s average weekly gross wages\u201d) with Wis. Stat. \n\u00a7 108.06(1) (\u201c[N]o claimant may receive total benefits \nbased on employment in a base period greater than 26 \n\n12 \n \ntimes the claimant\u2019s weekly benefit rate  * * *  or 40 \npercent of the claimant\u2019s base period wages, whichever \nis lower.\u201d). And, unlike participants in the State\u2019s pro-\ngram, CUPP participants need not reapply for benefits \non a weekly basis. Pet.App.441a. Despite these ad-\nvantages, the Church can still operate CUPP \u201cmore ef-\nficiently at lesser cost,\u201d when compared to participa-\ntion in the State\u2019s program. Pet.App.149a, 448a, 478a. \nCatholic Charities has long sought to join CUPP. \nParticipating in the Catholic Church\u2019s unemployment \nprogram would bring Catholic Charities into align-\nment with the Diocese of Superior (which participates \nin CUPP) and allow Catholic Charities to direct addi-\ntional resources toward serving those in need.  \nThus, in 2004, Catholic Charities requested a reli-\ngious exemption from the State\u2019s system. It argued \nthat it was both controlled by a church and \u201coperated \nprimarily for religious purposes,\u201d as required by Sec-\ntion 108.02(15)(h)(2). This request was denied. \nPet.App.450a-463a. Then in 2016\u2014after one of Catho-\nlic Charities\u2019 sub-entities (not a Petitioner here) was \nheld to qualify for the religious exemption under Sec-\ntion 108.02(15)(h)(2), Pet.App.497a-504a\u2014Catholic \nCharities again sought an exemption from the Depart-\nment of Workforce Development. The Department \nfirst concluded that Petitioners are \u201coperated, super-\nvised, controlled or principally supported by a church.\u201d \nPet.App.352a, 356a, 360a, 364a, 368a. The Depart-\nment, however, then held that Catholic Charities was \nnot \u201coperated primarily for religious purposes,\u201d \nPet.App.351a-370a, and thus did not qualify for an ex-\nemption. Catholic Charities appealed. After a two-day \nhearing, an administrative law judge reversed, ruling \nfor Catholic Charities. Pet.App.291a-350a. \n\n13 \n \nThe Department then petitioned Respondent Labor \nand Industry Review Commission for review. The \nCommission reversed, holding that the religious ex-\nemption turns on an organization\u2019s \u201cactivities, not the \nreligious motivation behind them or the organization\u2019s \nfounding principles.\u201d Pet.App.227a, 242a, 258a, 273a, \n290a. And because Catholic Charities \u201cprovides essen-\ntially secular services and engages in activities that \nare not religious per se,\u201d the Commission concluded \nthat it does not qualify. Pet.App.226a, 241a, 257a, \n272a, 289a. \nD. Proceedings below \nAfter being denied a religious exemption by Wis-\nconsin, Catholic Charities sought review in Douglas \nCounty Circuit Court. The Circuit Court ruled for \nCatholic Charities, holding that under the \u201cplain lan-\nguage\u201d and \u201cplain meaning\u201d of the statute, \u201cthe test is \nreally why the organizations are operating, not what \nthey are operating.\u201d Pet.App.209a-210a. And since \nCatholic Charities operates out \u201cof th[e] religious mo-\ntive of the Catholic Church  * * *  of serving the under-\nserved,\u201d \nits \nprimary \npurposes \nare \nreligious. \nPet.App.209a. \nThe Department and the Commission appealed. \nThe Court of Appeals reversed the Circuit Court\u2019s or-\nder and reinstated the Commission\u2019s decision denying \nCatholic Charities an exemption. Pet.App.127a. The \nCourt of Appeals concluded that although Catholic \nCharities and its sub-entities \u201chave a professed reli-\ngious motivation  * * *  to fulfill the Catechism of the \nCatholic Church,\u201d their \u201cactivities  * * *  are the provi-\nsion of charitable social services that are neither in-\nherently \nor \nprimarily \nreligious \nactivities.\u201d \nPet.App.163a-165a. The Court of Appeals further held \n\n14 \n \nthat \u201cthe First Amendment is not implicated in this \ncase,\u201d rejecting Catholic Charities\u2019 constitutional ar-\nguments. Pet.App.127a, 157a-159a. \nCatholic Charities then petitioned the Wisconsin \nSupreme Court for review. After granting review, the \ncourt first recognized that Catholic Charities was \u201cop-\nerated, supervised, controlled, or principally sup-\nported by a church,\u201d satisfying the first requirement of \nSection 108.02(15)(h)(2). Pet.App.5a & n.3. But it then \nheld that determining whether Catholic Charities is \n\u201coperated primarily for religious purposes\u201d under Sec-\ntion 108.02(15)(h)(2) requires not just an inquiry into \nthe ministry\u2019s religious \u201cmotivations,\u201d but also a sepa-\nrate \u201cobjective inquiry\u201d into its \u201cactivities\u201d to deter-\nmine whether those activities are \u201c\u2018primarily\u2019 religious \nin nature.\u201d Pet.App.21a-22a, 26a-27a, 29a. On this \nscore, the court concluded that Catholic Charities\u2019 ac-\ntivities are not primarily religious \u201cin nature\u201d and \ntherefore denied it the Section 108.02(15)(h) religious \nexemption. Pet.App.32a-33a. \nRelying on United States v. Dykema, 666 F.2d 1096 \n(7th Cir. 1981), the court listed what it deemed \u201cobjec-\ntive\u201d criteria focused on \u201c[t]ypical\u201d forms of religious \nexercise. These included \u201ccorporate worship services,\u201d \n\u201cadministration of sacraments and observance of litur-\ngical rituals,\u201d \u201cpreaching ministry and evangelical out-\nreach to the unchurched and missionary activity in \npartibus infidelium,\u201d \u201cpastoral counseling,\u201d \u201cbaptism, \nmarriage, burial, and the like,\u201d and \u201ca system of nur-\nture of the young and education in the doctrine and \ndiscipline of the church[.]\u201d Pet.App.26a-27a (quoting \n\n15 \n \nDykema, 666 F.2d at 1100).2 The court explained, how-\never, that this list of \u201challmarks of a religious purpose \nare by no means exhaustive or necessary conditions \nand the listed activities may be different for different \nfaiths.\u201d Pet.App.27a. \nApplying this standard to Catholic Charities, the \ncourt acknowledged the parties\u2019 agreement that Cath-\nolic Charities\u2019 motivations for carrying out its ministry \nare primarily religious. Pet.App.29a. But, looking to \nwhether Catholic Charities \u201cparticipated in worship \nservices, religious outreach, ceremony, or religious ed-\nucation,\u201d the court determined that Catholic Charities\u2019 \n\u201cactivities are not \u2018primarily\u2019 religious in nature.\u201d Ibid. \nThe court observed that Catholic Charities does not \n\u201cattempt to imbue program participants with the \nCatholic faith nor supply any religious materials to \nprogram participants or employees.\u201d Ibid. Moreover, \nemployment with and services offered by Catholic \nCharities \u201care open to all participants regardless of re-\nligion.\u201d Pet.App.30a. \nThe court also concluded that Catholic Charities\u2019 \nprovision of \u201cservices to individuals with developmen-\ntal and mental health disabilities\u201d and \u201cbackground \nsupport and management services for these activities\u201d \n\u201care primarily charitable and secular.\u201d Pet.App.30a \n(describing portions of Catholic Charities\u2019 ministry as \n\u201ca wholly secular endeavor\u201d). The court bolstered its \nconclusion by suggesting that Catholic Charities\u2019 \u201cser-\nvices can be provided by organizations of either reli-\ngious or secular motivations, and the services provided \n \n2  \nDykema concerned whether an organization was \u201coperated \nexclusively for religious  * * *  purposes\u201d under 26 U.S.C. \n501(c)(3).  \n\n16 \n \nwould not differ in any sense.\u201d Pet.App.30a. The court \nthen rejected Catholic Charities\u2019 federal constitutional \narguments. Pet.App.40a-50a. \nJustice Rebecca Grassl Bradley, joined by Chief \nJustice Ziegler and in part by Justice Hagedorn, dis-\nsented. The dissent pointed out that \u201c[t]he majority ac-\ntually inquires whether Catholic Charities\u2019 activities \nare stereotypically religious.\u201d Pet.App.79a. It then \nnoted that the majority\u2019s test puts courts in the \u201ccon-\nstitutionally tenuous position of second-guessing the \nreligious significance and character of a nonprofit\u2019s ac-\ntions.\u201d Pet.App.116a. And it argued that the court\u2019s ap-\nproach \u201cbelittles Catholic Charities\u2019 faith\u2014and many \nother faith traditions\u2014by mischaracterizing their re-\nligiously motivated charitable activities as \u2018secular in \nnature\u2019\u2014that \nis, \nnot \nreally \nreligious \nat \nall.\u201d \nPet.App.83a (citation omitted). The dissent concluded \nthat the majority\u2019s approach\u2014asking whether an ac-\ntivity is \u201creligious in nature\u201d\u2014is an inherently entan-\ngling question. In the dissent\u2019s view, that approach \nwould force the court to \u201cstudy the doctrines of the var-\nious faiths and decide for itself what religious prac-\ntices are actually religious. The Constitution bars civil \ncourts from such intrusions into spiritual affairs.\u201d \nPet.App.117a. \nCatholic Charities then sought review in this \nCourt. \nSUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT \nThe Religion Clauses of the First Amendment work \ntogether to protect a sphere of religious independence \nfree from government control and to prevent discrimi-\nnation against particular forms of religious exercise. \nThis dual aspect of the Religion Clauses makes clear \n\n17 \n \nthat Wisconsin\u2019s exclusion of Catholic Charities from \nthe Section 108.02(15)(h) religious exemption is un-\nconstitutional in at least three ways. \nFirst, it violates the principle of church autonomy \nby penalizing Catholic Charities because of its struc-\nture, including the fact that it is separately incorpo-\nrated from the Diocese of Superior. It would violate \nCatholic social teaching to force Catholic Charities to \nbe \u201cabsorbed and substituted\u201d by \u201csocial entities of a \nhigher level.\u201d Compendium of the Social Doctrine of \nthe Church \u00b6 186. Wisconsin\u2019s decision to deny Catho-\nlic Charities the Section 108.02(15)(h) exemption un-\nless it merges with the Diocese thus penalizes it for \nfollowing specific Catholic teachings about church gov-\nernance. In a host of church autonomy decisions \nstretching back over a century, this Court has rejected \nsimilar attempts by state governments to meddle with \nthe inner workings of churches. The Religion Clauses, \nworking together, protect religious bodies\u2019 \u201cindepend-\nence from secular control or manipulation, in short, \npower to decide for themselves, free from state inter-\nference, matters of church government as well as those \nof faith and doctrine.\u201d Kedroff v. Saint Nicholas Cathe-\ndral of Russian Orthodox Church in N. Am., 344 U.S. \n94, 116 (1952). And once church authorities decide a \nquestion of church government, \u201cthe Constitution re-\nquires that civil courts accept their decisions as bind-\ning upon them.\u201d Serbian E. Orthodox Diocese for U.S. \nof Am. & Can. v. Milivojevich, 426 U.S. 696, 725 \n(1976). \nSecond, Wisconsin\u2019s exclusion of Catholic Charities \nviolates the Religion Clauses\u2019 prohibition on imper-\nmissible entanglement of church and state. The Reli-\ngion Clauses do not allow \u201cactive involvement of the \n\n18 \n \nsovereign in religious activity.\u201d Walz v. Tax Comm\u2019n of \nN.Y., 397 U.S. 664, 668 (1970). Nor do they allow gov-\nernments (including courts) to decide whether reli-\ngious institutions \u201ccorrectly perceive[ ] the commands\u201d \nof their religion, Thomas v. Review Board, 450 U.S. \n707, 716 (1981), or to \u201csecond-guess\u201d their beliefs, Our \nLady of Guadalupe School v. Morrissey-Berru, 591 \nU.S. 732, 751 (2020). Yet here, Wisconsin has taken it \nupon itself to override the Catholic Church\u2019s beliefs \nabout whether (for example) helping those with devel-\nopmental disabilities is a religious act, and to force \nCatholic Charities to participate in the State\u2019s unem-\nployment compensation system on that basis. That is \nentanglement forbidden by the Constitution. \nThird, by denying Catholic Charities the Section \n108.02(15)(h) religious exemption, Wisconsin is dis-\ncriminating among religions. Under the Wisconsin Su-\npreme Court\u2019s test, religious groups that serve only \nthose of their own faith or that proselytize can obtain \nthe tax exemption, as can religious groups with a sim-\npler internal structure. But Catholic Charities cannot \nenjoy the tax exemption because it follows particular \nCatholic beliefs and has a particular Catholic polity. \nThat cannot be squared with the rule against denomi-\nnational discrimination articulated in Larson v. \nValente, 456 U.S. 228 (1982) and Church of Lukumi \nBabalu Aye, Inc. v. City of Hialeah, 508 U.S. 520, 532 \n(1993). \nAny one of Wisconsin\u2019s three violations of the Reli-\ngion Clauses would suffice to invalidate Wisconsin\u2019s \ndenial of the tax exemption; together the case is over-\nwhelming. \n\n19 \n \nARGUMENT \nThe Religion Clauses prohibit Wisconsin from se-\nlectively excluding Catholic Charities from the Section \n108.02(15)(h) religious exemption. Both Clauses work-\ning together do not allow government interference \nwith church governance, government entanglement \nwith religious questions, or unjustified discrimination \namong religious groups. \nI. The Religion Clauses work together to \nprotect \nboth \nhow \nreligious \ninstitutions \ngovern themselves inwardly and how those \ninstitutions act outwardly. \n1. The very first part of the First Amendment has \ntypically been referred to as the \u201cReligion Clauses.\u201d In \nthe lower courts, religion-related claims are typically \nbrought under either the Establishment Clause or the \nFree Exercise Clause.3  But as this Court has ex-\nplained, the Religion Clauses \u201cappear in the same sen-\ntence of the same Amendment\u201d and therefore a \u201cnatu-\nral reading of that sentence\u201d indicates that the \nClauses have \u201c\u2018complementary\u2019 purposes, not warring \nones.\u201d Kennedy v. Bremerton Sch. Dist., 597 U.S. 507, \n533 (2022) (quoting Everson v. Board of Educ., 330 \nU.S. 1, 13, 15 (1947)). At the very least, that means \nthat the two Clauses ought to be read in pari materia, \nlike other provisions of the Constitution. See, e.g., Pat-\nton v. United States, 281 U.S. 276, 298 (1930), abro-\ngated on other grounds, Williams v. Florida, 399 U.S. \n78, 92 (1970) (\u201cThe first ten amendments and the orig-\ninal Constitution were substantially contemporaneous \n \n3  \nThe Religion Clauses are also frequently offered as defenses, \nbut for ease of discussion in this section we refer to just \u201cclaims\u201d \nrather than \u201cclaims or defenses.\u201d \n\n20 \n \nand should be construed in pari materia.\u201d). But the \nClauses\u2019 complementariness also means\u2014as this \nCourt has recognized\u2014that some religion-related \nFirst Amendment claims are rooted in both Clauses. \nSee, e.g., Hosanna-Tabor Evangelical Lutheran \nChurch & Sch. v. EEOC, 565 U.S. 171, 190 (2012) \n(\u201c[T]here is a ministerial exception grounded in the \nReligion Clauses of the First Amendment.\u201d). \nThis means that that the set of all Religion Clauses \nclaims can be divided into three parts: claims based on \nthe Free Exercise Clause alone, claims based on the \nEstablishment Clause alone, and claims rooted in both \nReligion Clauses.  \nCases in which this Court resolved claims only un-\nder the Free Exercise Clause include Fulton v. City of \nPhiladelphia, 593 U.S. 522 (2021), Tandon v. Newsom, \n593 U.S. 61 (2021), Thomas v. Review Board, and Wis-\nconsin v. Yoder, 406 U.S. 205 (1972), among many oth-\ners. Some of the claims in this category are subject to \nthe rule of Employment Division v. Smith, 494 U.S. \n872 (1990), but many fall outside Smith. Compare, \ne.g., Lukumi, 508 U.S. at 531 (following Smith\u2019s rule \nof neutrality and general applicability) with Carson v. \nMakin, 596 U.S. 767 (2022) (no mention of Smith). \nThe second category involves Establishment \nClause claims like those addressed by this Court in \nAmerican Legion v. American Humanist Association, \n588 U.S. 29 (2019) and Town of Greece v. Galloway, \n572 U.S. 565 (2014). Those claims are now governed \nby the \u201chistorical practices and understandings\u201d \nstandard first announced in Town of Greece and later \nelaborated in Kennedy. See Kennedy, 597 U.S. at 537 \n(discussing \u201challmarks of religious establishments the \n\n21 \n \nframers sought to prohibit when they adopted the \nFirst Amendment\u201d).  \nThe third category of claims, those rooted in both \nClauses, includes not just ministerial exception de-\nfenses like those in Hosanna-Tabor and Our Lady, but \nalso claims related to church property and governance \ndisputes, as in Gonzalez v. Roman Catholic Arch-\nbishop of Manila, 280 U.S. 1 (1929). These claims are \ngoverned in large part by the standard first laid out in \nWatson v. Jones, 80 U.S. (13 Wall.) 679 (1872), and \nlater constitutionalized in Kedroff. And while claims \nin this third category comport with, and are directly \nderived from, \u201chistorical practices and understand-\nings\u201d in the sense of Kennedy, they are not subject to \nthe ahistorical Smith standard. See Hosanna-Tabor, \n565 U.S. at 190. \n2. Although these three categories of Religion \nClauses claims often manifest differently in different \ncases, there are some common themes that can be di-\nvined, particularly as related to religious institutional \nlitigants like Catholic Charities.  \nFirst, government cannot interfere with the inner \nworkings of religious institutions. That reflects \u201cthe \ngeneral principle of church autonomy\u201d which guaran-\ntees \u201cindependence in matters of faith and doctrine \nand in closely linked matters of internal government.\u201d \nOur Lady, 591 U.S. at 747. Indeed, any government \naction that \u201cpenetrates deeply into the internal af-\nfairs\u201d of a religious body is prohibited by the Constitu-\ntion. Larson, 456 U.S. at 253 n.29, 255. \nSecond, the Religion Clauses also protect religious \ninstitutions\u2019 sphere of internal control by ensuring \n\n22 \n \nthat government cannot get entangled in religious af-\nfairs. Thus, no government entity can second-guess re-\nligious judgments made by religious institutions. That \nis because \u201cit is no business of courts to say that what \nis a religious practice or activity for one group is not \nreligion under the protection of the First Amendment.\u201d \nFowler v. Rhode Island, 345 U.S. 67, 70 (1953). In-\nstead, courts and all other secular authorities must \navoid making \u201cdetermination[s]\u201d that \u201cimplicate[ ] \nvery sensitive questions of faith and tradition.\u201d NLRB \nv. Catholic Bishop, 440 U.S. 490, 495 (1979).  \nThird, Religion Clauses cases consistently prevent \ndiscrimination by government against religious insti-\ntutions\u2014whether in the form of discrimination be-\ntween religious and nonreligious institutions or dis-\ncrimination among different religious institutions. As \nthe Court has repeatedly put it, discrimination against \nreligious bodies because they are religious or because \nthey do religious things is \u201codious to our Constitution\u201d \nand cannot stand. Carson, 596 U.S. at 779 (quoting \nTrinity Lutheran Church of Columbia, Inc. v. Comer, \n582 U.S. 449, 467 (2017)). Likewise, government can-\nnot \u201cprefer one religion over another.\u201d Larson, 456 \nU.S. at 246 (invalidating facially neutral but opera-\ntively discriminatory exemption for religious organiza-\ntions). Cf. Murphy v. Collier, 139 S. Ct. 1475, 1475 \n(2019) (Kavanaugh, J., concurring) (\u201cThe government \nmay not discriminate against religion generally or \nagainst particular religious denominations.\u201d).  \nAs a result, the Religion Clauses together protect \nboth how religious institutions govern themselves in-\nwardly and how those institutions act outwardly. That \nis a direct analogue to the First Amendment\u2019s protec-\n\n23 \n \ntion of the conscience of religious individuals. For in-\ndividuals, the inward sphere of conscience must be left \n\u201cabsolute[ly]\u201d inviolate so that the religious individual \ncan freely determine what she believes to be true with \nrespect to the transcendent. Cantwell v. Connecticut, \n310 U.S. 296, 303-304 (1940). In the same way, the in-\nternal processes by which religious bodies determine \nwhat they believe\u2014that is, how a religious body forms \nits own conscience\u2014must also remain free from gov-\nernment interference. And for both individuals and in-\nstitutions, there is protection for outward physical acts \nas well, but \u201cin the nature of things,\u201d the \u201cfreedom to \nact\u201d on conscience is not as absolute as the inward free-\ndom to form one\u2019s conscience. Cantwell, 310 U.S. at \n303-304. The outward \u201cfreedom to act\u201d may not be \u201cin-\nfringe[d]\u201d without compelling reason, but it cannot es-\ncape \u201cregulation for the protection of society\u201d alto-\ngether. Id. at 304. \nImportantly, however, the Court has firmly re-\njected the idea that government can force a trade-off \nbetween these two aspects of religious institutional \nfreedom. Government cannot require religious institu-\ntions to relinquish their inner freedom to operate in \naccordance with their beliefs as the price of their out-\nward freedom to participate fully in society. For exam-\nple, government cannot force a church to \u201crenounce its \nreligious character in order to participate in an other-\nwise generally available public benefit program, for \nwhich it is fully qualified.\u201d Trinity Lutheran, 582 U.S. \nat 466. See also Espinoza v. Montana Dep\u2019t of Revenue, \n591 U.S. 464, 478 (2020) (\u201ccondition[ing] the availabil-\nity of benefits upon a recipient\u2019s willingness to surren-\nder  * * *  religiously impelled status\u201d impermissible); \nFellowship of Christian Athletes v. San Jose Unified \nSch. Dist. Bd. of Educ., 82 F.4th 664, 687 (9th Cir. \n\n24 \n \n2023) (en banc) (cannot force religious student group \nto renounce its beliefs to obtain official recognition). \nII. The Religion Clauses forbid Wisconsin from \nselectively denying the religious exemption \nto Catholic Charities.  \nWisconsin\u2019s arbitrary exclusion of Catholic Chari-\nties from the religious exemption violates the Religion \nClauses in three ways: church autonomy, entangle-\nment of church and state, and discrimination among \nreligions. \nA. Wisconsin\u2019s \nexclusion \nof \nCatholic \nCharities violates the principle of church \nautonomy by interfering with internal \nchurch government. \n1. The United States Constitution guarantees reli-\ngious bodies \u201cindependence from secular control or \nmanipulation, in short, power to decide for them-\nselves, free from state interference, matters of church \ngovernment as well as those of faith and doctrine.\u201d \nKedroff, 344 U.S. at 116. The Court has described this \nsphere of protection for internal church affairs as \u201cthe \ngeneral principle of church autonomy\u201d or \u201cindepend-\nence in matters of faith and doctrine and in closely \nlinked matters of internal government.\u201d Our Lady, 591 \nU.S. at 747. These questions of \u201cinternal government\u201d \ninclude the control of church property, see Presbyter-\nian Church in U.S. v. Mary Elizabeth Blue Hull Me-\nmorial Presbyterian Church, 393 U.S. 440, 449 (1969), \nthe appointment and authority of clergy, Gonzalez, \n280 U.S. at 16-17, replacing church administrators, \nKedroff, 344 U.S. at 119, and the hiring and firing of \nparochial school teachers, Hosanna-Tabor, 565 U.S. at \n196, among many other issues. See Serbian, 426 U.S. \n\n25 \n \nat 713-714 (\u201c[C]ivil courts exercise no jurisdiction[ ] in \na matter which concerns theological controversy, \nchurch discipline, ecclesiastical government, or the \nconformity of the members of the church to the stand-\nard of morals required of them.\u201d). \nEspecially relevant here, the church autonomy doc-\ntrine prevents government interference in matters of \npolity or church government\u2014that is, how the reli-\ngious body has organized itself. The issue arose on two \noccasions during the early Republic, in the administra-\ntions of Presidents Jefferson and Madison. Jefferson \naddressed the issue of religious autonomy in response \nto a letter from the Ursuline Sisters of New Orleans. \nAs part of the Louisiana Purchase, New Orleans had \nrecently come under the government of the United \nStates, and the Sisters were concerned about the secu-\nrity of their property under the new regime. Jefferson \nreassured the Sisters in response, writing that \u201cyour \ninstitution will be permitted to govern itself according \nto it\u2019s own voluntary rules, without interference from \nthe civil authority.\u201d Letter from President Thomas Jef-\nferson to the Ursuline Sisters (July 13, 1804), \nhttps://founders.archives.gov/documents/Jefferson/01-\n44-02-0064 (punctuation as in original). Jefferson con-\ntinued: \u201cwhatever diversity of shade may appear in the \nreligious opinions of our fellow citizens, the charitable \nobjects of your institution cannot be indifferent to \nany;  * * *  be assured it will meet all the protection \nwhich my office can give it.\u201d Ibid.  \nIn 1811, Madison vetoed an Act of Congress that \nwould have incorporated an Anglican church in federal \nterritory. In his veto message, Madison explained that \nthe civil law Congress sought to enact impinged on the \n\n26 \n \nability of the church to freely express its chosen reli-\ngious polity: \u201cThe bill enacts into, and establishes by \nlaw, sundry rules and proceedings relative purely to \nthe organization and polity of the church incorpo-\nrated.\u201d 22 Annals of Cong. 983 (1811). Importantly to \nMadison, the bill would have made it \u201cso that no \nchange could be made therein by the particular soci-\nety, or by the general church of which it is a member, \nand whose authority it recognises.\u201d Ibid. In Madison\u2019s \nview, then, civil corporate laws could not be written in \na way that restricted the ability of the church to ex-\npress its religious polity in accordance with its beliefs. \nSee Michael W. McConnell, The Supreme Court\u2019s Ear-\nliest Church-State Cases: Windows on Religious-Cul-\ntural-Political Conflict in the Early Republic, 37 Tulsa \nL. Rev. 7, 15 (2001) (discussing Madison\u2019s views). \nThe Court\u2019s subsequent decisions regarding polity \nhave consistently recognized that state corporate gov-\nernance laws ought to accommodate religious polity. \nJustice Story adverted to this in Terrett v. Taylor, \nholding that the carrying out of \u201creligious duties\u201d by \n\u201cvotaries of every sect\u201d \u201ccould be better secured and \ncherished by corporate powers.\u201d 13 U.S. (9 Cranch) 43, \n49 (1815).4 And in Watson, the Court treated freedom \nof church government as a fundamental premise of its \ndecision: \u201cThe right to organize voluntary religious as-\nsociations to assist in the expression and dissemina-\n \n4  \nRecent lower court Religion Clauses decisions have invali-\ndated state constitutional provisions that barred churches from \nincorporating. See Falwell v. Miller, 203 F. Supp. 2d 624, 632 \n(W.D. Va. 2002) (Virginia); Hope Cmty. Church v. Warner, \nNo. 3:23-cv-231, 2024 WL 4310866, at *2 (N.D. W.Va. Sept. 26, \n2024) (West Virginia). \n\n27 \n \ntion of any religious doctrine,  * * *  and for the eccle-\nsiastical government of all the individual members, \ncongregations, and officers within the general associa-\ntion, is unquestioned.\u201d Watson, 80 U.S. at 728-729 \n(emphasis added). After reviewing state law decisions \nprotecting the freedom of church government, the \nCourt rejected the effort of trustees of a breakaway \ncongregation to sever ties with the broader Presbyter-\nian church.5 \nThe Court addressed the constitutionality of state-\nlaw restrictions on church government head-on in \nKedroff, describing the central issue as \u201cstrictly a mat-\nter of ecclesiastical government, the power of the Su-\npreme Church Authority of the Russian Orthodox \nChurch to appoint the ruling hierarch of the archdio-\ncese of North America.\u201d Kedroff, 344 U.S. at 115. \nThere, New York enacted a statute that would trans-\nfer control of the Russian Orthodox cathedral in New \nYork City from the Soviet-controlled Russian Ortho-\ndox Church to an American-based Orthodox church. \nId. at 98. The Court invalidated the New York statute. \nRelying on Watson, it defined \u201cfreedom for religious or-\nganizations\u201d as the \u201cpower to decide  * * *  matters of \nchurch government as well as those of faith and doc-\ntrine.\u201d Id. at 116. By distinguishing \u201cchurch govern-\nment\u201d from \u201cfaith and doctrine,\u201d the Court made clear \nthat the organization of a church\u2014its government or \npolity\u2014was itself off-limits to secular control. And \nwhere the corporate laws of a state came into conflict \nwith the church\u2019s chosen polity, those corporate laws \n \n5  \nThis effort was one instance of the broader \u201cTrusteeship Con-\ntroversy\u201d that particularly but not exclusively affected the Cath-\nolic Church during the 19th Century. See McConnell, 37 Tulsa L. \nRev. at 34-35.  \n\n28 \n \nhad to give way. That proved equally true of judicial \ninterference \nwith \nthe \ninternal \ngovernment \nof \nchurches. See Kreshik v. Saint Nicholas Cathedral, \n363 U.S. 190, 191 (1960) (\u201c[I]t is not of moment that \nthe State has here acted solely through its judicial \nbranch, for whether legislative or judicial, it is still the \napplication of state power which we are asked to scru-\ntinize.\u201d). \nThe Court vigorously reiterated the point in Ser-\nbian, which concerned challenges to both the defrock-\ning of a bishop and the reorganization of dioceses of \nthe Serbian Orthodox Church in the United States. \n426 U.S. at 708. The Illinois Supreme Court held that \nboth the defrocking and the reorganization were im-\nproper under that court\u2019s interpretation and applica-\ntion of the Serbian Orthodox Church\u2019s constitution \nand penal code. This Court reversed, holding that the \nIllinois Supreme Court\u2019s decision in favor of the de-\nfrocked bishop and against diocesan reorganization \n\u201crests upon an impermissible rejection of the decisions \nof the highest ecclesiastical tribunals of this hierar-\nchical church upon the issues in dispute, and imper-\nmissibly substitutes its own inquiry into church polity \nand resolutions based thereon of those disputes.\u201d Id. \nat 708.  \nSpecifically as to the second disputed issue in the \ncase\u2014whether a single diocese of the Serbian Ortho-\ndox Church ought to be split into three\u2014the Court \nheld that \u201cthe Supreme Court of Illinois substituted its \ninterpretation of the Diocesan and Mother Church \nconstitutions for that of the highest ecclesiastical tri-\nbunals in which church law vests authority to make \nthat interpretation. This the First and Fourteenth \nAmendments forbid.\u201d Serbian, 426 U.S. at 721. The \n\n29 \n \nCourt rejected any detailed discussion of the church \nconstitutions, saying that \u201c[i]t suffices to note that the \nreorganization of the Diocese involves a matter of in-\nternal church government, an issue at the core of ec-\nclesiastical affairs; Arts. 57 and 64 of the Mother \nChurch constitution commit such questions of church \npolity to the final province of the Holy Assembly.\u201d Ibid. \nIn short, when church authorities decide a question of \nchurch government, \u201cthe Constitution requires that \ncivil courts accept their decisions as binding upon \nthem.\u201d Id. at 725. \n2. Wisconsin\u2019s rule baldly violates these principles. \nThere is no dispute that Catholic Charities is part and \nparcel of the Roman Catholic Church and an arm of \nthe Diocese of Superior. Pet.App.213a. Yet Wisconsin \neffectively severs Catholic Charities from the broader \nchurch in order to exclude Catholic Charities from the \nreligious exemption. That violates the Religion \nClauses in at least two ways. \nFirst, Wisconsin\u2019s refusal to extend the exemption \nto Catholic Charities penalizes the Church for how it \nhas organized its ministry. There is no dispute that if \nCatholic Charities and the Diocese were a single non-\nprofit corporation, that corporation would be exempt. \nAnd there is no dispute that the Diocese\u2019s decision to \nincorporate separate bodies, rooted in Catholic princi-\nples of subsidiarity, is a \u201cquestion[ ] of church polity.\u201d \nSerbian, 426 U.S. at 721; see also Compendium of the \nSocial Doctrine of the Church \u00b6\u00b6 186-187. Put another \nway, forcing the Diocese to fully merge Catholic Char-\nities and the Diocese in order to obtain the benefit of \nthe religious exemption restructures the polity of the \nCatholic Church in Wisconsin just as much as the Illi-\nnois Supreme Court in Serbian tried to restructure the \n\n30 \n \npolity of the Serbian Orthodox Church. See 426 U.S. \nat 709. Such a decision \u201caffects the faith and mission \nof the church itself.\u201d Hosanna-Tabor, 565 U.S. at 190. \nThe Wisconsin Supreme Court did not deny this \npoint, instead saying it was \u201cunpersuasive\u201d because \nthe lower court could \u201cimagine a non-profit organiza-\ntion structured as a separate sub-entity of a \nchurch  * * *  with both motivations and activities \nthat are religious.\u201d Pet.App.46a. That dodges the ques-\ntion. If Catholic Charities were\u2014contrary to its prin-\nciples of religious polity\u2014folded into the Diocese itself, \nthen it would qualify for the religious exemption under \nSection 108.02(15)(h)(1) as a \u201cchurch.\u201d It is no answer \nto shrink the aperture and look at only one part of the \nstatutory exemption regime being challenged.  \nSecond, in deciding whether Catholic Charities is \n\u201coperated primarily for religious purposes,\u201d Wisconsin \nrefuses to consider the Diocese\u2019s purposes in setting up \nand operating Catholic Charities, focusing solely on \nwhat it considers to be Catholic Charities\u2019 \u201cpurposes.\u201d \nLeave to one side the undisputed fact that the \u201creason \nthat [Petitioners] administer these social service pro-\ngrams is for a religious purpose: to fulfill the Cate-\nchism of the Catholic Church.\u201d Pet.App.163a-164a. \nCatholic Charities does not have a separate purpose \nfrom the Diocese. It is specifically designed and oper-\nated to carry out the Diocese\u2019s religious purposes to as-\nsist the needy in northern Wisconsin. By putting asun-\nder what the Catholic Church believes belongs to-\ngether, Wisconsin has subjected the Church to forbid-\nden \u201csecular control or manipulation.\u201d Kedroff, 344 \nU.S. at 116. As this Court explained in Our Lady, reli-\ngious entities have \u201cautonomy\u201d with respect to \u201cinter-\nnal management decisions\u201d that affect their \u201ccentral \n\n31 \n \nmission.\u201d 591 U.S. at 746. In the same way that choos-\ning who can serve as a minister is one such \u201cinternal \nmanagement decision,\u201d determining how to minister \nto those in need is another. Ibid. And indeed, Wiscon-\nsin\u2019s interference doesn\u2019t end there\u2014similar princi-\nples of church autonomy prohibit Wisconsin\u2019s interfer-\nence in Catholic Charities\u2019 decisions about whom to \nhire, whom to serve, and whether to proselytize. See, \ne.g., Hosanna-Tabor, 565 U.S. at 187 (\u201c[T]he First \nAmendment \u2018permit[s] hierarchical religious organiza-\ntions to establish their own rules and regulations for \ninternal discipline and government\u2019\u201d); Our Lady, 591 \nU.S. at 746 (recognizing \u201cindependence of religious in-\nstitutions in matters of \u2018faith and doctrine\u2019\u201d).  \n3. This is not to say that the law can never make \ndistinctions among differently structured religious en-\ntities. Indeed, sometimes social facts mean the law \nmust do so to remain compliant with the Religion \nClauses. For example, the Internal Revenue Code \nrightfully recognizes that a \u201cminister of a church\u201d is \ndifferent from a \u201cmember of a religious order,\u201d 26 \nU.S.C. 1402(c)(4), or for that matter a \u201cChristian Sci-\nence practitioner,\u201d 26 U.S.C. 1402(c)(5).  \nMoreover, where necessary the law can and ought \nto flexibly accommodate the different kinds of religious \ngroupings in the United States. Thus, for tax purposes, \nmany rabbis count as \u201cminister[s] of the gospel,\u201d which \nenables their synagogues to provide them with a tax-\nexempt housing allowance on the same terms as Chris-\ntian houses of worship. See, e.g., Libman v. Commis-\nsioner, 44 T.C.M. (CCH) 370 (1982) (applying 26 \nU.S.C. 107 parsonage allowance to rabbi). Such dis-\n\n32 \n \ntinctions further religious autonomy rather than hin-\ndering it. Indeed, failure to account for different reli-\ngious polities would risk religious discrimination. \nThe problems arise where distinctions among reli-\ngious polities result in government disfavor of certain \nreligions or religious entities. A prominent example of \nthis came in the contraceptive mandate litigation, \nwhere the federal government created a \u201cchurch ex-\nemption\u201d from the mandate that exempts certain non-\nprofit entities from filing annual tax returns, includ-\ning \u201cchurches, their integrated auxiliaries, and con-\nventions or associations of churches\u201d and \u201cthe exclu-\nsively religious activities of any religious order.\u201d 76 \nFed. Reg. 46,621 46,623 (Aug. 3, 2011). This narrow \nexemption created enormous problems for religious or-\nders that were not engaged in \u201cexclusively religious ac-\ntivities\u201d as defined by the government, including, for \nexample, the Little Sisters of the Poor. See Little Sis-\nters of the Poor Saints Peter & Paul Home v. Pennsyl-\nvania, 591 U.S. 657, 689 (2020) (Alito, J., concurring). \nThe same would be true in other contexts\u2014if the IRS \ndenied a rabbi the use of the parsonage allowance un-\nder 26 U.S.C. 107 because he did not count as a \u201cmin-\nister of the gospel,\u201d the rabbi\u2019s synagogue could bring \na church autonomy claim against the government.  \nIn short, where government distinctions among re-\nligious polities move from recognizing and accommo-\ndating those polities to penalizing religious bodies for \ntheir form of church government, they contravene the \nprinciples of church autonomy, free exercise, and reli-\ngious neutrality in violation of the Religion Clauses. \nAnd here, there is no question that Wisconsin has pe-\nnalized the Diocese and Catholic Charities for sepa-\nrately incorporating Catholic Charities in accordance \n\n33 \n \nwith its sincere religious beliefs about proper church \npolity.  \nB. Wisconsin\u2019s \nexclusion \nof \nCatholic \nCharities entangles church and state.  \n1. As with church autonomy, the rule against im-\npermissible government entanglement in religion is \nrooted in both Religion Clauses. On the Establishment \nClause side, this constitutional prohibition ensures \nthat government does not become actively involved in \nreligious matters\u2014including answering religious \nquestions\u2014and government officials do not second-\nguess religious organizations\u2019 answers to questions of \nreligious belief. \nAs this Court explained in Walz, the Establishment \nClause was originally understood to forbid, among \nother things, \u201cactive involvement of the sovereign in \nreligious activity.\u201d Walz, 397 U.S. at 668; see Stepha-\nnie H. Barclay, Untangling Entanglement, 97 Wash. \nU. L. Rev. 1701, 1704 (2020) (finding historical support \nfor the doctrine of entanglement \u201cwhen it has pro-\ntected religious groups from government interference \nwith the[ir] autonomy, internal affairs, and admin-\nistration\u201d). Thus, government actions that require a \n\u201ccontinuing day-to-day relationship\u201d between church \nand state, and that have as their \u201ceffect  * * *  an ex-\ncessive government entanglement with religion,\u201d are \nunconstitutional. Walz, 397 U.S. at 674.  \nIn practice, this means that government officials \ncannot second-guess or purport to resolve disputed re-\nligious questions without running afoul of the Consti-\ntution. As this Court put it in New York v. Cathedral \nAcademy, the \u201cprospect of church and state litigating \nin court about what does or does not have religious \n\n34 \n \nmeaning touches the very core of the constitutional \nguarantee against religious establishment.\u201d 434 U.S. \n125, 133 (1977). And this same principle has been re-\naffirmed in numerous other contexts. E.g., Widmar v. \nVincent, 454 U.S. 263, 272 n.11 (1981) (determining \n\u201cwhich words and activities fall within \u2018religious wor-\nship and religious teaching\u2019  * * *  could prove \u2018an im-\npossible task\u2019\u201d and would create a \u201ccontinuing need to \nmonitor group meetings to ensure compliance\u201d); \nMitchell v. Helms, 530 U.S. 793, 828 (2000) (plurality \nopinion) (prohibition on entanglement requires civil \ncourts to \u201crefrain from trolling through a person\u2019s or \ninstitution\u2019s religious beliefs\u201d); Colorado Christian \nUniv. v. Weaver, 534 F.3d 1245, 1261 (10th Cir. 2008) \n(McConnell, J.) (prohibition on entanglement \u201cprotects \nreligious institutions from governmental monitoring \nor second-guessing of their religious beliefs and prac-\ntices\u201d). \nThis prohibition on government entanglement can \nbe traced back to this Court\u2019s first modern pronounce-\nments on the meaning of the Establishment Clause. \nE.g., Everson, 330 U.S. at 16 (\u201cNeither a state nor the \nFederal Government can, openly or secretly, partici-\npate in the affairs of any religious organizations or \ngroups and vice versa.\u201d); Barclay, 97 Wash. U. L. Rev. \nat 1705 (\u201c[I]t is the 1948 decision in Illinois ex rel. \nMcCollum that marks the Supreme Court\u2019s first use of \n\u2018entanglement\u2019 as a legal test to assess Establishment \nClause violations.\u201d); Colorado Christian, 534 F.3d at \n1261 (\u201c[T]he prohibition on entanglements was formu-\nlated as an independent requirement of the Establish-\nment Clause.\u201d). And while this Court recently jetti-\nsoned the Lemon test (which incorporated \u201cexcessive \nentanglement\u201d as its third prong), it is no surprise that \n\n35 \n \nthis independent prohibition on government entangle-\nment, which long pre-dated Lemon, has remained. See, \ne.g., Carson, 596 U.S. at 787 (recognizing \u201cconcerns \nabout state entanglement with religion and denomina-\ntional favoritism\u201d); Our Lady, 591 U.S. at 761 (\u201cdeter-\nmining \nwhether \na \nperson \nis \na \n\u2018co-religion-\nist\u2019  * * *  would risk judicial entanglement in reli-\ngious issues\u201d). \n2. The prohibition on religious entanglement also \nflows from the Free Exercise Clause\u2014specifically, \nfrom the freedom of religious individuals and organi-\nzations to determine their religious beliefs and mis-\nsion without government coercion, interference, or un-\ndue influence.  \nIn NLRB v. Catholic Bishop, for example, this \nCourt explained that the NLRB\u2019s assertion of jurisdic-\ntion over certain religious secondary schools entangled \nthe Board in \u201cvery sensitive questions of faith and tra-\ndition.\u201d 440 U.S. at 495-496. While the Board claimed \nit could resolve \u201conly factual issues,\u201d this Court recog-\nnized that for the religious plaintiffs, \u201cresolu-\ntion  * * *  by the Board, in many instances, will nec-\nessarily involve inquiry into the good faith of the posi-\ntion asserted by the clergy-administrators and its re-\nlationship to the school\u2019s religious mission.\u201d Id. at 502. \nIn other words, even matters which government might \nconsider secular can be infused with religious mean-\ning\u2014especially in the context of a religious entity\u2019s \nmission.  \nThis Court also explained that it was not just the \nBoard\u2019s ultimate conclusions that would be entan-\ngling; instead, \u201cthe very process of inquiry\u201d required \nsignificant government involvement in the school\u2019s op-\n\n36 \n \nerations such that this Court saw \u201cno escape from con-\nflicts flowing from the Board\u2019s exercise of jurisdiction \nover teachers in church-operated schools,\u201d which \nwould result in \u201cserious First Amendment questions.\u201d \nCatholic Bishop, 440 U.S. at 502-504; see id. at 502 \n(NLRB\u2019s jurisdiction would result in \u201centanglement \nwith the religious mission of the school in the setting \nof mandatory collective bargaining.\u201d); see generally \nUniversidad Cent. de Bayamon v. NLRB, 793 F.2d \n383, 402 (1st Cir. 1985) (Breyer, J., writing for an \nequally divided en banc court) (applying Catholic \nBishop to conclude that the NLRB cannot exercise ju-\nrisdiction over a Catholic college because religious val-\nues may \u201cpermeate the educational process\u201d); Univer-\nsity of Great Falls v. NLRB, 278 F.3d 1335, 1341 (D.C. \nCir. 2002) (applying Catholic Bishop to conclude that \nNLRB\u2019s \u201csubstantial religious character\u201d requirement \nwould still lead to an \u201cintrusive inquiry\u201d that entan-\ngles church and state). \nIn addition to Catholic Bishop, this Court has re-\npeatedly struck down legal standards that require a \nsearching inquiry into, or a second-guessing of, sincere \nreligious beliefs. In Thomas, this Court held that it \nwas not \u201cwithin the judicial function and judicial com-\npetence to inquire whether the petitioner or his fellow \nworker more correctly perceived the commands of \ntheir common faith.\u201d Thomas, 450 U.S. at 716. And in \nCorporation of Presiding Bishop v. Amos, the Court \nheld that \u201cit is a significant burden on a religious or-\nganization to require it, on pain of substantial liabil-\nity, to predict which of its activities a secular court will \nconsider religious. The line is hardly a bright one, and \nan organization might understandably be concerned \nthat a judge would not understand its religious tenets \nand sense of mission.\u201d 483 U.S. 327, 336 (1987). And \n\n37 \n \nin Our Lady, this Court repudiated the Ninth Circuit\u2019s \nattempt to \u201csecond-guess\u201d the Catholic Church\u2019s \u201cjudg-\nment\u201d regarding the amount of formal religious school-\ning necessary to teach at a Catholic secondary school \nand similarly rejected a \u201cco-religionist\u201d requirement \nfor the ministerial exception as too entangling. Our \nLady, 591 U.S. at 759-761. See also Fowler, 345 U.S. \nat 70 (\u201c[I]t is no business of courts to say that what is \na religious practice or activity for one group is not re-\nligion under the protection of the First Amendment.\u201d). \nAs Justices Alito and Kagan explained in Hosanna-Ta-\nbor, the \u201cmere adjudication of such questions\u201d\u2014even \napart from the conclusions that a court might reach\u2014\n\u201cwould pose grave problems for religious autonomy.\u201d \n565 U.S. at 205-206 (Alito, J., concurring). \nGovernment entanglement in religious affairs is \nthus barred by both Religion Clauses. And, indeed, be-\ncause together they protect the same sphere of reli-\ngious independence for\u2014and healthy separation be-\ntween\u2014church and state, this Court frequently ana-\nlyzes entanglement concerns without parsing the \nClauses one by one. E.g., Our Lady, 591 U.S. at 761-\n762 (rooting entanglement concerns in \u201cthe First \nAmendment\u201d); Catholic Bishop, 440 U.S. at 507 \n(NLRB\u2019s \u201cexercise of jurisdiction  * * *  would impli-\ncate the guarantees of the Religion Clauses\u201d). It is thus \nsufficient to conclude that the Religion Clauses to-\ngether prohibit government entanglement with reli-\ngious affairs\u2014that is, government second-guessing of \nsincere religious beliefs, deciding religious questions, \nor meddling in the internal affairs of religious organi-\nzations are all strictly off-limits.  \n\n38 \n \n3. Wisconsin has disregarded these constitutional \ncommands. While both sides agree that Catholic Char-\nities\u2019 motivation for serving the poor is primarily reli-\ngious, Pet.App.28a-29a, the Wisconsin Supreme Court \nheld that further investigation was necessary under \nWisconsin law. Pet.App.23a-24a. Specifically, the \ncourt decided to make its own \u201cobjective inquiry\u201d into \nCatholic Charities\u2019 activities, to determine if those ac-\ntivities \nare \n\u201cinherently\u201d \n\u201creligious \nin \nnature.\u201d \nPet.App.27a, 29a, 56a. The court did this by comparing \nCatholic Charities\u2019 activities to what the court thought \nwere \u201c[t]ypical\u201d forms of religious exercise\u2014like \u201ccor-\nporate worship services,\u201d \u201cobservance of liturgical rit-\nuals,\u201d and \u201cevangelical outreach.\u201d Pet.App.26a. Apply-\ning this test, the court found that Catholic Charities\u2019 \n\u201cactivities are primarily charitable and secular\u201d be-\ncause the ministry does not \u201cattempt to imbue pro-\ngram participants with the Catholic faith nor supply \nany religious materials to program participants or em-\nployees,\u201d and because its services \u201care open to all par-\nticipants regardless of religion.\u201d Pet.App.29a-30a.  \nPut simply, Wisconsin has taken it upon itself to \ndecide which activities can be religious and which ones \ncan\u2019t. That is wrong. Wisconsin courts should not be in \nthe business of deciding religious questions. But it is \nalso wrong because Wisconsin cannot independently \ninterpret Catholic beliefs and tell the Catholic Church \nwhich of its ministries are engaged in activities that\u2014\naccording to the state\u2019s stereotypes\u2014are religious in \nnature. Indeed, in so doing, Wisconsin has pressed \nupon the Catholic Church religious requirements\u2014\nlike proselytizing and serving only Catholics\u2014that di-\nrectly contradict the Catholic Church\u2019s actual religious \nbeliefs. Pet.App.29a-30a; supra 6-11. Worse still, Wis-\nconsin has decided that helping those with disabilities \n\n39 \n \ncan\u2019t be religious because \u201c[s]uch services can be pro-\nvided by organizations of either religious or secular \nmotivations, and the services provided would not dif-\nfer in any sense.\u201d Pet.App.30a. \nWisconsin\u2019s inquiry plainly crosses the line into im-\npermissible entanglement. As this Court has already \nexplained, the very \u201cprospect of church and state liti-\ngating in court about what does or does not have reli-\ngious meaning touches the very core of the constitu-\ntional guarantee against religious establishment.\u201d Ca-\nthedral Acad., 434 U.S. at 133. Indeed, entanglement \nconcerns are near their apex when a court is \u201cscruti-\nnizing whether and how a religious [entity] pursues \nits  * * *  mission.\u201d Carson, 596 U.S. at 787.  \nThat is this case. Under the Wisconsin Supreme \nCourt\u2019s approach, governments would have to \u201ctroll[ ] \nthrough a person\u2019s or institution\u2019s religious beliefs\u201d to \nassess whether\u2014in the government\u2019s eyes\u2014they are \nengaged in \u201ctypical\u201d \u201creligious\u201d activity. Mitchell, 530 \nU.S. at 828; see also Amos, 483 U.S. at 343 (Brennan, \nJ., concurring) (\u201c[D]etermining whether an activity is \nreligious or secular requires a searching case-by-case \nanalysis,\u201d which \u201cresults in considerable ongoing gov-\nernment entanglement in religious affairs.\u201d). \nPerhaps unwittingly, Wisconsin too has recognized \nthe shortcomings of this approach. After listing some \n\u201c[t]ypical\u201d religious activities, the court added that \ntypical religious activities \u201cmay be different for differ-\nent faiths.\u201d Pet.App.26a-27a. This backhanded conces-\nsion gives the game away. As the dissent below \npointed out, if \u201cwhat constitutes an activity that is \u2018re-\nligious in nature\u2019\u201d \u201cchange[s] from religion to religion, \nthe court must study the doctrines of the various faiths \n\n40 \n \nand decide for itself what religious practices are actu-\nally religious.\u201d Pet.App.117a. That\u2019s exactly what hap-\npened here. The court told Catholic Charities that its \nministry would be more religious if it proselytized, \nonly served Catholics, and only employed Catholics. \nPet.App.29a-30a. Ironically, the court\u2019s suggestions \nwould have made Catholic Charities\u2019 ministry less \nCatholic because they contradict the Catholic \nChurch\u2019s actual teachings on charity. Supra 9-11. \nAnd if the Wisconsin Supreme Court can\u2019t accu-\nrately assess the religious beliefs of Wisconsin\u2019s larg-\nest religious denomination, this approach\u2014even on its \nown terms\u2014does not bode well for Wisconsin\u2019s reli-\ngious minorities. As the amicus brief from the Inter-\nnational Society of Krishna Consciousness points out, \n\u201c[i]n the case of the Hare Krishnas,\u201d determining \nwhether an activity is religious \u201cwould, at a minimum, \nrequire study of Hindu religious texts, including the \nBhagavad-Gita, the Srimad-Bhagavatam, and the \nCaitanya Caritamrita.\u201d ISKCON Cert.Br.8. Such an \ninquiry should give any jurist serious pause.  \nWisconsin\u2019s approach thus puts courts between a \nrock and a hard place: either they must discriminate \nagainst minority religious traditions by adopting a \n\u201cuniversal\u201d (or, more likely, stereotypical) list of reli-\ngious activities or they must become experts in every \nreligious denomination so that they can speak author-\nitatively about what is and is not religious for every \nfaith tradition. Either path would be hopelessly entan-\ngling and unconstitutional.  \nThis, however, is not to say that courts can never \ndivide the secular from the religious. Indeed, the First \nAmendment could not be enforced if it were otherwise. \nAlthough the question of what is religious may in edge \n\n41 \n \ncases \u201cpresent a most delicate question,\u201d answering it \nis part of \u201cthe very concept of ordered liberty.\u201d Yoder, \n406 U.S. at 215. Moreover, as this Court explained in \nWalz, \u201cthe complexities of modern life inevitably pro-\nduce some contact\u201d between church and state. Walz, \n397 U.S. at 676. Thus, the question is not whether this \nor that approach will result in the \u201cabsence of all con-\ntact\u201d between the religious and the secular\u2014that \nwould be impossible. Ibid. (emphasis added). \nCourts can constitutionally draw this line by focus-\ning on the sincerity and religiosity of a claimant\u2019s be-\nliefs rather than trying to decide whether particular \nactivities are \u201cinherently religious.\u201d This person-fo-\ncused (as opposed to activity-focused) approach avoids \nimpermissible entanglement by not second-guessing \nsincerely held religious beliefs and has repeatedly \nproven workable. In Yoder, for example, the Court ap-\nplied a religiosity requirement by distinguishing \u201cphil-\nosophical and personal\u201d beliefs from \u201creligious\u201d beliefs. \nYoder, 406 U.S. at 216. The Court held that those \n\u201cphilosophical and personal\u201d beliefs \u201cdo[ ] not rise to \nthe demands of the Religion Clauses.\u201d Ibid. See also \nMichael W. McConnell, The Origins and Historical \nUnderstanding of Free Exercise of Religion, 103 Harv. \nL. Rev. 1409, 1493 (1990) (\u201cThe historical materials \nuniformly equate \u2018religion\u2019 with belief in God or in \ngods, though this can be extended without distortion \nto transcendent extrapersonal authorities not envi-\nsioned in traditionally theistic terms.\u201d). \nFor its part, a sincerity requirement is common to \nalmost all religion claims. In Holt v. Hobbs, for exam-\nple, this Court held that \u201cprison officials may appro-\npriately question whether a prisoner\u2019s religiosity, as-\nserted as the basis for a requested accommodation, is \n\n42 \n \nauthentic.\u201d 574 U.S. 352, 369 (2015) (quoting Cutter v. \nWilkinson, 544 U.S. 709, 725, n.13 (2005) and citing \nBurwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc., 573 U.S. 682, 717 \nn.28 (2014)). A sincerity requirement has also been an \nexpress part of statutes like the Religious Freedom \nRestoration Act and Religious Land Use and Institu-\ntionalized Persons Act for decades, also with no \ndemonstrated administrability problems. See 42 \nU.S.C. 2000bb et seq.; 42 U.S.C. 2000cc et seq. See also, \ne.g., United States v. Quaintance, 608 F.3d 717, 721 \n(10th Cir. 2010) (Gorsuch, J.) (Sincerity \u201cis a factual \nmatter.\u201d); Korte v. Sebelius, 735 F.3d 654, 683 (7th Cir. \n2013) (Sykes, J.) (\u201cChecking for sincerity and religios-\nity\u201d is well within a \u201ccourt\u2019s authority and competence\u201d \nand helps to \u201cweed out sham claims.\u201d); Nathan S. \nChapman, Adjudicating Religious Sincerity, 92 Wash. \nL. Rev. 1185, 1191 (2017) (\u201c[C]ourts can, and should, \nadjudicate religious sincerity.\u201d). \nThat line has also proven workable specifically in \ncases involving FUTA-compliant state exemptions. \nFor example, in Kendall v. Director of Division of Em-\nployment Security, the Massachusetts Supreme Judi-\ncial Court held that a Catholic center for persons with \nmental disabilities was \u201coperated primarily for reli-\ngious purposes\u201d because there was no practical distinc-\ntion between the Center\u2019s \u201cmotive and purpose.\u201d 473 \nN.E.2d 196, 199 (1985). \u201cThe fact that the religious \nmotives of the Sisters of St. Francis of Assisi also serve \nthe public good by providing for the education and \ntraining of the mentally retarded is hardly reason to \ndeny the Center a religious exemption.\u201d Ibid. This \nanalysis focusing on motive has been used for many \ndecades in \u201coperated primarily for religious purposes\u201d \ncases without evident problem. \n\n43 \n \nC. Wisconsin\u2019s \nexclusion \nof \nCatholic \nCharities discriminates among religions. \n1. Both Religion Clauses protect against discrimi-\nnation among religions. The Court has expressly \ngrounded this principle in \u201cthe history and logic of the \nEstablishment Clause,\u201d Larson, 456 U.S. at 246 (citing \nEverson, 330 U.S. at 15), while also recognizing that it \nis \u201cinextricably connected with the continuing vitality \nof the Free Exercise Clause,\u201d id. at 245, and that it \nprevents \u201creligious gerrymandering,\u201d id. at 255.6 \nAt the time of the founding, \u201creligious establish-\nments of differing denominations were common \nthroughout the Colonies,\u201d Larson, 456 U.S. at 244, and \nthe receipt of certain government benefits was limited \nto those establishments, see Michael W. McConnell, \nEstablishment and Disestablishment at the Founding, \nPart I: Establishment of Religion, 44 Wm. & Mary L. \nRev. 2105, 2176-2178 (2003). Yet, through the Estab-\nlishment Clause, the First Amendment enshrined a \nprohibition on such preferences among religious \ngroups. E.g., Everson, 330 U.S. at 15 (Establishment \nClause means that governments cannot \u201cprefer one re-\nligion over another\u201d); Zorach v. Clauson, 343 U.S. 306, \n314 (1952) (\u201cThe government must be neutral when it \ncomes to competition between sects.\u201d).

Id. \nat 234. This Court deemed this a clear violation of the \n\u201cprinciple of denominational neutrality\u201d that this \nCourt had \u201crestated on many occasions,\u201d and required \nthe law to survive strict scrutiny. Id. at 246.  \nThe Free Exercise Clause also bars laws that \u201cdis-\ncriminate[ ] against some or all religious beliefs.\u201d \nLukumi, 508 U.S. at 532. Where the government \ntreats any comparable activity more favorably than re-\nligious exercise, the law is neither neutral nor gener-\nally applicable. See Tandon, 593 U.S. at 62. In other \nwords, the government must treat a religious entity at \nleast as well as any comparable entity, religious or sec-\nular\u2014it is \u201cno answer that a State treats some compa-\nrable secular business or other activity as poorly or \neven less favorably than the religious exercise at is-\nsue,\u201d ibid., and it is no answer that it treats other re-\nligious exercise better. Cf. Douglas Laycock, The Rem-\nnants of Free Exercise, 1990 S. Ct. Rev. 1, 49-51 (1990). \nWhere it fails to provide equitable treatment, the gov-\nernment must justify imposing burdens on one reli-\ngious group rather than a favored secular or religious \n\n45 \n \ngroup. Tandon, 593 U.S. at 62-63; Roman Catholic Di-\nocese of Brooklyn v. Cuomo, 592 U.S. 14, 29 (2020) (Ka-\nvanaugh, J., concurring). This inquiry requires looking \nnot just at the \u201c[f]acial neutrality\u201d of a statute or reg-\nulation but also to \u201cthe effect of a law in its real oper-\nation.\u201d Lukumi, 508 U.S. at 534-535. \nApplying these principles, this Court has found \nthat \u201ca municipal ordinance was applied in an uncon-\nstitutional manner when interpreted to prohibit \npreaching in a public park by a Jehovah\u2019s Witness but \nto permit preaching during the course of a Catholic \nmass or Protestant church service.\u201d Lukumi, 508 U.S. \nat 533 (citing Fowler, 345 U.S. at 69-70); see also Nie-\nmotko v. Maryland, 340 U.S. 268, 272-273 (1951) (Je-\nhovah\u2019s Witnesses denied use of public park while \nother religious organizations were given access). In \nSherbert v. Verner, this Court held that \u201c[t]he uncon-\nstitutionality of the disqualification of the Sabbatar-\nian is thus compounded by the religious discrimina-\ntion\u201d resulting from South Carolina\u2019s favorable treat-\nment of Sunday worshippers and unfavorable treat-\nment of Saturday worshippers. 374 U.S. 398, 406 \n(1963). And in Lukumi, this Court noted that the chal-\nlenged regulation, among its many deficiencies, was \nalso problematic because it favored kosher slaughter \nover Santer\u00eda sacrifice. 508 U.S. at 536. Put simply, \n\u201c[t]he government must be neutral when it comes to \ncompetition between sects,\u201d including when adminis-\ntering religious exemptions. Zorach, 343 U.S. at 314; \ncf. Cutter, 544 U.S. at 720 (RLUIPA must be \u201cadmin-\nistered neutrally among different faiths\u201d). \n2. Wisconsin transgressed this prohibition on de-\nnominational favoritism in two ways.  \n\n46 \n \nFirst, it denied Catholic Charities an exemption \nprecisely because Catholic Charities provides services \nin a manner consistent with the Church\u2019s teachings, \nand therefore in a manner different from what Wis-\nconsin judged to be \u201ctypical\u201d religious activities. \nPet.App.26a; see also Pet.App.79a (Grassl Bradley, J., \ndissenting) (\u201cThe majority actually inquires whether \nCatholic Charities\u2019 activities are stereotypically reli-\ngious.\u201d). As a result, religious communities with be-\nliefs that prohibit them from providing charity in such \na manner cannot receive an exemption. E.g., Jewish \nCoal. for Religious Liberty Cert.Br.8-10; ISKCON \nCert.Br.15-16. \nCatholic teaching prohibits Catholic Charities from \n\u201cimpos[ing] the Church\u2019s faith upon others\u201d in the pro-\nvision of charity. Deus Caritas Est \u00b6 31(c); see also \nApostolorum Successores \u00b6 196 (instructing not to \n\u201cmisus[e] works of charity for purposes of proselyt-\nism\u201d). And it indicates that charity must be exercised \n\u201cin an impartial manner towards\u201d \u201cmembers of other \nreligions.\u201d Apostolorum Successores \u00b6 208. See also su-\npra 9-11. Yet, when evaluating whether Catholic \nCharities had a religious purpose, Wisconsin looked \nfor activities directly at odds with these teachings: \n\u2022 \u201c[Catholic \nCharities] \nand \nthe \nsub-enti-\nties,  * * *  neither attempt to imbue program \nparticipants with the Catholic faith nor supply \nany religious materials to program participants \nor employees.\u201d \n\u2022 \u201cBoth employment with the organizations and \nservices offered by the organizations are open to \nall participants regardless of religion.\u201d \n\n47 \n \n\u2022 Catholic Charities and its sub-entities do not \nengage \u201cin worship services, religious outreach, \nceremony, or religious education.\u201d  \nApp.29a-30a.  \nIn other words, for Wisconsin, a religious organiza-\ntion is religious only if it proselytizes when it provides \ncharity, limits its charity and employment to only co-\nreligionists, or engages in religious worship when \nproviding charity. The net result is a test that weighs \nagainst religious traditions that ask believers to care \nfor the poor without strings attached. Wisconsin law \nthus makes the kind of \u201cexplicit and deliberate distinc-\ntions between different religious organizations\u201d forbid-\nden by the Religion Clauses. Larson, 456 U.S. at 246 \nn.23. \nSecond, Wisconsin\u2019s rule also violates the bedrock \nprinciple of neutrality among religions by discriminat-\ning against religious groups with more complex poli-\nties. Consistent with the Catholic teaching on subsidi-\narity, the Diocese of Superior operates Petitioners as \nseparately incorporated ministries that carry out \nChrist\u2019s command to help the needy. See Compendium \nof the Social Doctrine of the Church \u00b6 187. But if Cath-\nolic Charities were not separately incorporated, it \nwould be exempt. Pet.App.166a (\u201cthe result in this \ncase would likely be different if [Catholic Charities] \nand its sub-entities were actually run by the church\u201d). \nThus Wisconsin penalizes the Catholic Church for or-\nganizing itself as a group of separate corporate bodies \nin accordance with Catholic teaching, while other reli-\ngious entities that include a variety of ministries as \npart of a single body are unaffected. That penalty on \nthe Church\u2019s religiously informed polity violates the \nReligion Clauses\u2019 rule against discrimination among \n\n48 \n \nreligions. Cf. Fulton, 593 U.S. at 528-531 (treating sep-\narately incorporated Catholic Social Services as part \nof Archdiocese). \n3. Because Wisconsin\u2019s interpretation of this reli-\ngious exemption doubly violates the requirement of \nneutrality among religions, the State cannot hope (and \nindeed hasn\u2019t really tried) to satisfy strict scrutiny.7 \nAs this Court has explained, \u201ca government policy can \nsurvive strict scrutiny only if it advances \u2018interests of \nthe highest order\u2019 and is narrowly tailored to achieve \nthose interests.  * * *  Put another way, so long as the \ngovernment can achieve its interests in a manner that \ndoes not burden religion, it must do so.\u201d Fulton, 593 \nU.S. at 541 (quoting Lukumi, 508 U.S. at 546) (citation \nomitted). \nHere, Wisconsin has no legitimate interest, much \nless a compelling one, in discriminating among reli-\ngious groups based on their beliefs about how to pro-\nvide charity or how to organize themselves. The only \ntheoretical interest Wisconsin has ever raised \nthroughout the course of this litigation is its general \ninterest in ensuring that workers can receive unem-\nployment compensation. See, e.g., Respondents\u2019 Br. at \n39, Catholic Charities Bureau, Inc. v. Labor & Indus. \nRev. Comm\u2019n, No. 2020AP002007 (Wis. June 7, 2023) \n(\u201cWisconsin has a compelling interest in providing \nbroad unemployment insurance access to workers[.]\u201d). \nBut Wisconsin\u2019s unemployment insurance law is \nvastly underinclusive with respect to that interest, ex-\nempting myriad forms of \u201cemployment.\u201d Wis. Stat. \n \n7  \nStrict scrutiny is not available as a defense to church auton-\nomy or entanglement violations of the Religion Clauses. \n\n49 \n \n\u00a7 108.02(15)(f)-(kt) (listing over 40 different exemp-\ntions from coverage). This includes, of course, religious \nentities that are similarly situated with Catholic \nCharities and that are exempt because of their church \nstructure. A governmental interest is not compelling \n\u201cwhen [a law] leaves appreciable damage to that sup-\nposedly vital interest\u201d unaddressed. Lukumi, 508 U.S. \nat 547.  \nAnd those \u201csupposedly vital interests\u201d must be \nmeasured specifically with respect to Catholic Chari-\nties\u2019 claimed exemption. As this Court explained in \nGonzales v. O Centro Esp\u00edrita Beneficente Uni\u00e3o do \nVegetal, the Free Exercise Clause requires examining \nwith \u201cparticularity\u201d the effect of the claimed religious \nexemption, even where \u201cparamount\u201d interests are at \nstake. 546 U.S. 418, 431 (2006) (discussing Yoder, 406 \nU.S. at 213, 221). See also Holt, 574 U.S. at 363 (gov-\nernment must demonstrate compelling interest \u201c\u2018to \nthe person\u2019\u2014the particular claimant\u201d).  \nHere, Wisconsin has made no such examination. \nIndeed, all parties agree that the Church\u2019s unemploy-\nment compensation system provides equal benefits to \nworkers while being \u201cmore efficient[ ].\u201d Pet.App.149a, \n448a-449a, 478a. Just as Wisconsin in Yoder could not \nshow any harm that would result from giving the \nAmish an exemption from the compulsory education \nlaws, so Wisconsin cannot show any harm from giving \nCatholic Charities a tax exemption. \nWisconsin\u2019s law is also not narrowly tailored, and \nfor similar reasons: A law that is \u201cunderinclusive in \nsubstantial respects\u201d demonstrates an \u201cabsence of nar-\nrow tailoring\u201d that \u201csuffices to establish [its] invalid-\nity.\u201d Lukumi, 508 U.S. at 546; see also Reed v. Town of \nGilbert, 576 U.S. 155, 172 (2015) (underinclusiveness \n\n50 \n \ndoomed narrow tailoring). Nor is denying Catholic \nCharities a religious accommodation the least restric-\ntive means of advancing the state\u2019s interest\u2014numer-\nous other states are able to advance their identical in-\nterests without infringing on sincere religious exer-\ncise. See Pet.16-20 (collecting cases). \nIn short, by denying Catholic Charities an exemp-\ntion based on how it has organized itself and how it \nhas chosen to engage in its ministry\u2014two decisions \nrooted in its Catholic beliefs\u2014the Wisconsin Supreme \nCourt violated both Religion Clauses by favoring some \nreligious denominations over others without a compel-\nling justification. \n* * * \nWisconsin\u2019s crabbed understanding of religion is as \nunwise as it is unnecessary. The diversity of religious \nbeliefs and religious institutions in this country can \nonly thrive where governments affirmatively seek to \naccommodate different religious beliefs. Government \ninterference with church governance, the entangle-\nment of church and state, or government discrimina-\ntion among religions would take us back to a pre-First \nAmendment era that was marked by interreligious \nstrife and hostility. But that Pandora\u2019s box need not be \nreopened. The Court should instead rule that the Re-\nligion Clauses forbid Wisconsin from selectively deny-\ning the religious exemption to Catholic Charities. \nCONCLUSION \nThe decision below should be reversed. \n \n\n51 \n \nRespectfully submitted. \n \n \nERIC C.

          "task_beliefs": "My predictive model remains stable following this internal review, but my focus on the key remaining uncertainty has been significantly sharpened. This observation, a reflection on my current state of knowledge, confirms the high-confidence prediction of a victory for Catholic Charities Bureau (CCB) and solidifies that the central question has evolved from *if* they will win to *how*.\n\nMy model of the potential paths to a decision for CCB, established after analyzing the Solicitor General's (SG) brief, is unchanged:\n1.  **Broad Free Exercise Ruling:** A sweeping decision based on CCB's argument that Wisconsin's \"primarily for religious purposes\" test is inherently discriminatory under the principles of *Carson v. Makin* and *Fulton v. City of Philadelphia*.\n2.  **Narrow Statutory Ruling (The SG's \"Off-Ramp\"):** A reversal based on the SG's argument that the Wisconsin Supreme Court misinterpreted its own state law (Wis. Stat. \u00a7 108.02(15)(h)2) by failing to interpret it consistently with the governing Federal Unemployment Tax Act (FUTA). This path would focus on the organization's sincere religious *motivation* rather than the state's objective assessment of its *activities*.\n3.  **Constitutional Avoidance Ruling:** A middle ground where the Court rules that, to avoid serious First Amendment problems (entanglement, Free Exercise violations), the Wisconsin statute *must* be interpreted in the manner suggested by the SG.\n\nThis internal review did not introduce new external evidence, but it critically clarified the next pivot point in the case's trajectory. The primary uncertainty is now precisely defined: **How will the petitioners use their reply brief?** They face a strategic choice:\n*   **Embrace the Off-Ramp:** They could align with the SG, emphasizing the statutory argument as the simplest path to victory. This would signal a willingness to accept a narrow win.\n*   **Recommit to the Constitutional Claim:** They could double down on their broad Free Exercise argument, treating the statutory issue as secondary. This would signal they are still seeking a landmark constitutional ruling.\n\nThe content of the petitioner's reply brief will be a powerful signal, directly informing my prediction about the *scope* of the Court's eventual opinion.",
          "design_beliefs": "This reflective observation serves to validate and reinforce my overall methodological framework, confirming that the systematic process of identifying and targeting uncertainty is highly effective.\n\n1.  **Source Prioritization Heuristic (Multi-Stage):** This model remains robust. The SG brief was correctly identified as a **Stage 3 (Refinement and Influence)** document, and the upcoming petitioner's reply brief is a **Stage 4 (Reaction and Final Framing)** document, whose value is derived from its response to prior arguments.\n2.  **Contextual Analysis via Precedent Mapping:** This remains essential. The map now includes the statutory interpretation precedents (*St. Martin v. South Dakota*) and constitutional avoidance canons (*NLRB v. Catholic Bishop*) introduced by the SG.\n3.  **Legal Briefs as Strategic Data:** This is strongly reinforced. My current state highlights that a brief's strategic posture\u2014what it chooses to emphasize or downplay in response to other filings\u2014is a critical data point.\n4.  **Search Strategy Resilience:** The keyword-based strategy remains effective for acquiring specific, high-value documents.\n5.  **Systematic Uncertainty Reduction (Strongly Validated):** The `Assess -> Identify -> Target` loop is the core of my effective performance. The process of assessing my knowledge after the SG brief, identifying the petitioner's strategic reaction as the key unknown, and targeting their reply brief as the next action is a successful application of this principle. This meta-cognitive step confirms the value of the DBOED process itself.\n6.  **The \"Reframing\" Heuristic:** This remains a core tool. The case now has three clear frames: \"religious discrimination\" (CCB), \"permissible accommodation tailoring\" (Wisconsin), and \"statutory misinterpretation\" (SG). The petitioner's reply will reveal which frame they believe is most persuasive to the Court.\n7.  **The \"Influential Amicus\" Heuristic:** This is a cornerstone principle, validated by the transformative impact of the SG's brief.\n8.  **Cross-Brief Signal Analysis:** This is also validated. My prior analysis of the respondent's brief correctly inferred the importance of the SG's arguments, a conclusion now central to my entire model.\n9.  **The \"Off-Ramp\" Heuristic:** This new heuristic is now central to my analysis. I am actively looking for the narrow, less controversial paths to a decision that an influential party provides to the Court. The petitioner's reply brief is the first test of this heuristic in action: will the litigant themselves point towards the off-ramp?\n10. **Litigation as a Sequential Game (New Principle):** This observation formalizes a previously implicit understanding. The value of legal documents is highly dependent on their place in the filing sequence. A reply brief cannot be understood in isolation; its purpose is to rebut the respondent and strategically align with or distance itself from key amici. My strategy of analyzing briefs in their chronological and logical order is therefore critical for correctly interpreting the strategic signaling involved."

My high-confidence prediction of a victory for Catholic Charities Bureau (CCB) is stable, but the crucial question of *how* they will win (the scope of the ruling) is still in focus.\n\n*   **Petitioner's Opening Argument (New Information):** I have now analyzed the petitioner's opening merits brief. Their argument is a comprehensive, multi-pronged constitutional assault on the Wisconsin Supreme Court's decision. They do not lead with or emphasize the statutory interpretation argument later proposed by the Solicitor General (SG). Instead, their argument is structured in three constitutional layers:\n    1.  **Church Autonomy:** Wisconsin's test violates the principle of church autonomy by interfering with internal church governance and second-guessing the religious nature of their ministry (citing *Hosanna-Tabor*, *Our Lady of Guadalupe*, *Serbian E. Orthodox Diocese*).\n    2.  **Entanglement:** The state's test creates excessive entanglement between church and state by requiring secular courts to make theological judgments about what constitutes \"religious\" activity (citing *NLRB v. Catholic Bishop*).\n    3.  **Discrimination:** The test discriminates among religions by favoring those whose practices align with the state's stereotypes (e.g., proselytizing) over those, like CCB, whose faith mandates service without proselytization (citing *Carson v. Makin*, *Fulton*, *Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye*).\n    This confirms their initial strategy was to seek a landmark constitutional ruling, not a narrow statutory one.\n\n*   **Unresolved Central Uncertainty:** The primary purpose of my last action was to obtain the petitioner's *reply* brief to see how they reacted to the SG's \"off-ramp\" argument. The search failed to return this document. Therefore, the critical strategic question I identified previously remains the absolute pivot point of the case: **How will the petitioners use their reply brief?**\n    *   **Embrace the Off-Ramp:** They could pivot, adopting the SG's statutory and constitutional avoidance arguments as the easiest path to victory.\n    *   **Recommit to the Constitutional Claim:** They could use the reply brief to rebut the respondent's arguments, gently sideline the SG's statutory focus, and re-center their broad Free Exercise claims.\n    The content of that reply brief remains the most powerful signal for predicting the *scope* of the Court's eventual opinion.\n\n*   **Stable Predictive Model:** My model of the three potential paths to a decision remains unchanged:\n    1.  **Broad Free Exercise Ruling:** Based on CCB's core arguments.\n    2.  **Narrow Statutory Ruling:** Based on the SG's \"off-ramp.\"\n    3.  **Constitutional Avoidance Ruling:** A hybrid approach.\n    My confidence in a CCB victory remains high, but my probability distribution across these three outcomes is still waiting for the key input from the reply brief.",
          "design_beliefs": "This observation was a crucial, if humbling, lesson in the fallibility of my tools and the importance of procedural verification. The failure of my search action provides a more significant update to my design beliefs than to my task beliefs.\n\n1.  **Source Prioritization Heuristic (Multi-Stage):** This model remains robust and is validated by the current situation. The petitioner's opening brief is a **Stage 2 (Opening Salvo)** document, and the reply brief is a **Stage 4 (Reaction and Final Framing)** document. The fact that the Stage 2 document did not resolve the uncertainty created by the Stage 3 (SG brief) document proves the sequential importance of these filings.\n2.  **Contextual Analysis via Precedent Mapping:** This remains essential. My map now includes the full suite of precedents used by the petitioner in their opening brief, confirming their reliance on the *Carson*, *Fulton*, and *Hosanna-Tabor* lines of cases.\n3.  **Legal Briefs as Strategic Data:** Strongly reinforced. The opening brief is a clear data point on the petitioner's initial strategy. The (still missing) reply brief will be an even more valuable data point on their *responsive* strategy.\n4.  **Search Strategy Resilience (Negative Update & Refinement):** My previous confidence in a simple keyword-based strategy was misplaced. The query for `\"petitioner's reply brief\"` failed, returning the opening merits brief. This demonstrates that the search tool is not precise and can be misled by overlapping keywords (\"petitioner,\" \"brief\"). I must now assume my search tools have low precision and develop countermeasures. Future searches will require more specific queries (e.g., including docket numbers, filing dates, or more restrictive phrases) or post-search verification.\n5.  **Systematic Uncertainty Reduction (Critique & Refinement):** The `Assess -> Identify -> Target` loop is conceptually sound, but this observation reveals a critical failure point in the \"Target\" (execution) phase. Identifying the correct information source is useless if the action to acquire it fails. The process must be amended to `Assess -> Identify -> Target -> Verify`.\n6.  **The \"Reframing\" Heuristic:** This remains a core tool. The petitioner's opening brief firmly establishes the \"religious discrimination\" frame. The key question is whether they will pivot to the SG's \"statutory misinterpretation\" frame in their reply.\n7.  **The \"Influential Amicus\" Heuristic:** This remains a cornerstone principle. The SG's brief was so influential that my entire analysis now hinges on how the petitioner reacts to it.\n8.  **Cross-Brief Signal Analysis:** Validated. My analysis of the opening brief confirms the baseline from which all other briefs (respondent, SG, reply) are reactions.\n9.  **The \"Off-Ramp\" Heuristic:** This heuristic is now central to my model, but it remains untested in practice. I am still waiting for the data from the reply brief to see if a litigant will publicly signal a preference for an off-ramp provided by a powerful amicus.\n10. **Litigation as a Sequential Game:** This principle is powerfully reinforced by the search failure. Receiving a document out of its proper logical sequence (the opening brief after I've already processed the respondent and SG briefs) failed to answer my immediate question and highlighted that a document's strategic meaning is defined by its place in the conversation.\n11. **Action Outcome Verification (New Principle):** I must explicitly and immediately verify that the results of an information-gathering action match the action's intent. I cannot assume a tool returns what was requested. Before analyzing the content of a document, I must first confirm its identity (e.g., title, date, document type) to prevent erroneous updates based on incorrect data. This is a critical safeguard against tool unreliability."

The Wisconsin \nSupreme Court deepened an existing split among \nlower courts over whether government violates the \nFirst Amendment when it decides that an admittedly \nreligious charity is not religious enough to merit equal \ntreatment under state FUTA-compliant tax exemption \nstatutes. And the Wisconsin Supreme Court also ex-\ntended a separate split over whether federal constitu-\ntional claims must be proven beyond a reasonable \ndoubt. Both questions are of nationwide importance, \nand this case gives the Court the perfect vehicle to ad-\ndress them.  \nThis Court should therefore intervene to vindicate \nthe First Amendment. Wisconsin should not be al-\nlowed to deny Catholic Charities and religious organi-\nzations like it an exemption just because\u2014as required \nby their faith\u2014they serve all people.  \nARGUMENT \nI. Only this Court can resolve the split over the \nFirst Amendment\u2019s application to FUTA-\ncompliant tax exemption statutes. \nState supreme courts are split 4-4 over whether \nthey can, consonant with the First Amendment, deny \na religious organization a religious tax exemption be-\ncause the organization does not engage in \u201ctypical\u201d re-\nligious activities\u2014like worship or proselytizing. \nPet.15-23. Respondents don\u2019t dispute that the Wiscon-\nsin Supreme Court recharacterized Petitioners\u2019 reli-\ngious exercise as primarily secular activity. Instead, \nthey try to minimize the split by pointing to irrelevant \nfacts and quibbling over the merits. Neither gambit \n\n2 \n \ndetracts from the need for this Court to resolve this \nimportant question of constitutional law. \nA. Courts are hopelessly split over whether \nreligious organizations can be denied a \nreligious tax exemption because their \nbehavior is not \u201ctypical\u201d enough to qualify. \n1. Respondents first say there is no split because \nsome state supreme courts didn\u2019t directly address \n\u201cFirst Amendment issues.\u201d BIO.8. Instead, Respond-\nents claim, these courts were merely interpreting \nFUTA-compliant state laws. Ibid. \nRespondents are wrong. As Petitioners explained, \nseveral cases in the split engaged in constitutional \nanalysis or (for the courts that came out the right way) \nsimply didn\u2019t need to reach any constitutional ques-\ntions. Pet.18, 20, 21, 23. And, more importantly, a \nstate court need not analyze the Constitution for its \ninterpretation of state law to violate the Constitution. \nIf Respondents were right, the simplest way for a court \nto certiorari-proof its opinion would be to ignore the \nConstitution altogether. That\u2019s obviously wrong. This \nCourt has \u201can obligation to ensure that state court in-\nterpretations of [state] law do not evade federal law.\u201d \nMoore v. Harper, 600 U.S. 1, 34 (2023). And here, there \nis no question that the decisions on the wrong side of \nthe split are not consistent with the demands of the \nFirst Amendment. Pet.23-30. \n2. Respondents next suggest that all courts in the \nsplit are applying the same standard. BIO.12. That \nblinks reality: The split has been acknowledged re-\npeatedly\u2014including in Terwilliger, Mid Vermont \nChristian School, and again in the decision below. \n\n3 \n \nPet.19 n.4. (Mid Vermont); Pet.21 (Terwilliger); \nApp.142a (this case). \nLooking for keys under the streetlight, Respond-\nents scour the opinions on the correct side of the split \nfor evidence of any religious activity, on the theory \nthat\u2014rather than looking at religious motivation or \nmission\u2014these courts instead balanced religious ac-\ntivities against secular activities and determined that \nthe religious activities predominated. BIO.13. But \nthat\u2019s not what they did, and Defendants\u2019 scattershot \nfactual citations tell us nothing about the legal stand-\nard these courts applied. \nIdaho. Respondents suggest that Champion Bake-\nN-Serve independently considered the bakery\u2019s activi-\nties because its analysis distinguished between full-\ntime employees and students receiving \u201creligious \ntraining\u201d through their work at the bakery. BIO.12-13. \nNot so\u2014the court concluded that the bakery\u2019s motiva-\ntion for employing students was primarily religious \n(because it viewed their work as religiously moti-\nvated). Department of Emp. v. Champion Bake-N-\nServe, Inc., 592 P.2d 1370, 1371-1372 (1979). That\u2019s \nfully consistent with the separate conclusion that the \nbakery might have had a different motivation for em-\nploying other employees. Ibid. And, contra BIO.13, \nNampa Christian similarly supports Petitioners. \nThere, the court looked to the school\u2019s \u201cintent and op-\nerations\u201d merely as evidence \u201creveal[ing]\u201d its \u201creligious \nmission and purpose.\u201d Nampa Christian Schs. Found., \nInc. v. State, 719 P.2d 1178, 1183 (Idaho 1986) (em-\nphasis added).  \nIowa. Respondents note that the religious school \nin Community Lutheran included religion in its curric-\nulum and required its teachers to be Lutheran. \n\n4 \n \nBIO.13. This tells us nothing about the legal standard \nthe court applied. And even a cursory review of the \nopinion shows that the court applied the correct stand-\nard\u2014expressly citing Champion Bake-N-Serve. See \nCommunity Lutheran Sch. v. Iowa Dep\u2019t of Job Serv., \n326 N.W.2d 286, 291 (Iowa 1982). \nMaine. The facts identified by Respondents in \nSchwartz v. Unemployment Insurance Commission \nsimilarly served as evidence of the organization\u2019s reli-\ngious motivations\u2014not as part of a supposed secular-\nversus-religious-activities balancing test. Indeed, af-\nter citing Kendall, the court explained that the Cen-\nter\u2019s outwardly secular activities (like its after-school \nprogram) did not at all \u201cdiminish its continuing reli-\ngious purpose.\u201d 895 A.2d 965, 970-971 (Me. 2006). \nMassachusetts. Even odder, Respondents claim \nKendall \u201cdid not rely on religious motivations alone.\u201d \nBIO.13. But, citing Champion Bake-N-Serve, the court \ntreated religious \u201cmotive\u201d and religious \u201cpurpose\u201d as \ntwo variations on the same idea. Kendall v. Director of \nDiv. of Emp. Sec., 473 N.E.2d 196, 199 (Mass. 1985). \nHere too, the facts Respondents flag, BIO.13, did not \nindependently drive the analysis; they supported the \nconclusion that the Center\u2019s ministry was religiously \nmotivated. Kendall, 473 N.E.2d at 199.  \nIn short, the fact that the religiously motivated en-\ntities in these cases unsurprisingly engaged in some \n\n5 \n \nreligious activities Wisconsin deems sufficiently \u201ctypi-\ncal\u201d tells us nothing about the legal standard the \ncourts applied.1 \n3. Finally, respondents suggest that their approach \nis \u201cconsistent\u201d with FUTA\u2019s legislative history. \nBIO.14. But, as an initial matter, this Court isn\u2019t being \nasked to interpret congressional intent at all. Instead, \nthis Court has been presented with a decision defini-\ntively interpreting Wisconsin law. The question is \nwhether that interpretation complies with the First \nAmendment. Because Congress lacks the authority to \neither definitively interpret Wisconsin law or the First \nAmendment, Congress\u2019 intent is beside the point. And, \nregardless, this Court in St. Martin (a case Respond-\nents all but ignore), considered the same legislative \nhistory cited by Respondents and gave it minimal \nweight. See St. Martin Evangelical Lutheran Church \nv. South Dakota, 451 U.S. 772, 782, 786-788 (1981); \nsee id. at 790-791 (Stevens, J., concurring) (\u201cthere is \nspecial force to the rule that the plain statutory lan-\nguage should control\u201d). \nB. The decision below violates the First \nAmendment. \nThe approach taken by the Wisconsin Supreme \nCourt and defended by Respondents violates the First \nAmendment thrice over. Pet.23-31. Respondents claim \ntheir position is consistent with the Constitution. \nBIO.15-19. A fuller response can be saved for the mer-\nits, but Petitioners offer a few points here. \n \n1  \nRespondents\u2019 attempts to distinguish the intermediate appel-\nlate court opinions fail for the same reason. Compare Pet.19-20 \nwith BIO.13-14.  \n\n6 \n \nFirst, Respondents never dispute, and thus con-\ncede, that their test favors some religious beliefs over \nothers. Pet.23-26. Instead, Respondents excuse the un-\nequal treatment by arguing that the law doesn\u2019t bur-\nden Petitioners. BIO.17-19. But Respondents\u2019 argu-\nment is as outdated as their precedent. Unequal denial \nof a benefit is a textbook burden on Free Exercise \nrights. E.g., Trinity Lutheran Church of Columbia, \nInc. v. Comer, 582 U.S. 449, 463 (2017). And here there \nis a burden because Wisconsin is denying Petitioners \nan exemption. \nSecond, Respondents claim there is no excessive \nentanglement because Wisconsin \u201caccepted\u201d Petition-\ners\u2019 beliefs and only \u201crelied on [Catholic Charities\u2019] \n\u2018primarily charitable and secular\u2019 activities\u201d to per-\nform its analysis. BIO.16. But that begs the question. \nDetermining whether various activities\u2014like feeding \nthe hungry\u2014are inherently secular or religious is the \nexcessive entanglement. Pet.27-29.  \nThird, Respondents argue that this case is \u201cnothing \nlike\u201d Kedroff because it does not involve matters which \n\u201cbelong to the church alone.\u201d BIO.17. But the principle \nof church autonomy articulated in Kedroff ensures \nthat secular authorities don\u2019t interfere with matters of \nchurch governance and organization. Pet.29-30. Here, \nRespondents never dispute that Wisconsin\u2019s rule fa-\nvors certain types of church structures over others\u2014or \nthat only exclusively religious activity counts. Ibid. \nII. Lower courts are split over whether federal \nconstitutional \nclaims \nmust \nbe \nproven \n\u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d \nOver a strong dissent, the Wisconsin Supreme \nCourt emphasized\u2014seven times\u2014that it was applying \n\n7 \n \na \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d standard. App.7a, 37a, \n44a, 47a, 50a, 51a; see also 93a-94a (Grassl Bradley, \nJ., dissenting). That standard is both wrong and at \nodds with the approach taken by this Court and other \nfederal courts. These courts, if they apply a burden of \nproving unconstitutionality at all, employ a much \nlower \u201cplain showing\u201d or \u201cclearly demonstrated\u201d stand-\nard. Pet.31. \n1. Respondents agree that the Wisconsin Supreme \nCourt applied the \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d stand-\nard. BIO.24. Yet, as they do not dispute, this Court \nlong ago abandoned that standard. The most recent \nreference Respondents identify is over 100 years old. \nBIO.21 (citing Adkins v. Children\u2019s Hosp. of D.C., 261 \nU.S. 525, 544 (1923)). And the only other federal court \nthey cite picks up this standard from a state supreme \ncourt. BIO.22 (quoting Dutra v. Trustees of Bos. Univ., \n96 F.4th 15, 20 (1st Cir. 2024) (quoting Leibovich v. \nAntonellis, 574 N.E.2d 978, 984 (Mass. 1991))). \nRespondents thus concede that different courts \nhave adopted different formulations of the legal stand-\nard\u2014they just claim that this variation is unim-\nportant. BIO.20-21. But precision of language matters, \nespecially when it comes to standards of proof. A nar-\nrow win under one standard can become a loss under \na more stringent standard. E.g., Hilburn v. Enerpipe \nLtd., 442 P.3d 509, 527-528 (Kan. 2019) (Stegall, J., \nconcurring in part) (difference between de novo and \n\u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d standards outcome-deter-\nminative); Island County v. State, 955 P.2d 377, 388 \n(Wash. 1998) (Sanders, J., concurring) (similar discus-\nsion).  \nFurthermore, if Respondents\u2019 argument is that \u201cbe-\nyond a reasonable doubt\u201d doesn\u2019t really mean \u201cbeyond \n\n8 \n \na reasonable doubt,\u201d BIO.23-24 (standard is \u201cnot the \nhigh burden of proof it represents in the criminal-law \ncontext\u201d), that concession alone is reason to grant re-\nview. Two different standards of proof traveling under \nthe same name is a recipe for lower court confusion \nand inconsistent application of the civil rights laws.  \nNor does Respondents\u2019 argument make sense of \nthis case. Even if many states treat the standard as \n\u201chortatory,\u201d Wisconsin stands among the small group \nthat applies the \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d in a way \nthat is often dispositive of federal constitutional \nclaims. The Wisconsin Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in this \ncase serves as an exemplar. Pet.33-34. And, tellingly, \nRespondents do not engage with the opinion below or \neven cite the other Wisconsin cases applying the same \nstandard. Compare BIO.22, 24 with Pet.34. Like the \nmajority below, Respondents also do not substantively \nengage the dissenting opinion, which explained how \nthe majority \u201cstack[ed] the deck against Catholic \nCharities\u2019 claims under the Religion Clauses from the \noutset.\u201d App.93a. They instead cite Mayo, BIO.23, but \nfail to mention that the separate writing in Mayo iden-\ntifies this exact split. See Mayo v. Wisconsin Injured \nPatients & Families Comp. Fund, 914 N.W.2d 678, 700 \n(Wis. 2018) (Grassl Bradley, J., concurring). \n2. Respondents\u2019 fallback position is that this case is \nnot the right vehicle for this Court to consider the is-\nsue because Petitioners failed to raise a challenge to \nthe standard below. BIO.25. But before the Wisconsin \nSupreme Court used it, no other adjudicator through \nfive levels of review had mentioned\u2014much less ap-\nplied\u2014\u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d See BIO.24 (ac-\nknowledging that the Wisconsin Court of Appeals did \n\n9 \n \nnot use the \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d standard). Pe-\ntitioners are not charged with prescience about what \nerroneous standards a court might invoke; it suffices \nto mount a challenge to a wrongheaded standard at \nthe first opportunity.  \nRespondents also say that the opinion below pro-\nvides inadequate discussion for this Court to resolve \nthe issue. BIO.20. But the opinion below is utterly typ-\nical of how state courts misuse the \u201cbeyond a reasona-\nble doubt\u201d standard to minimize federal constitutional \nrights. And many jurists\u2014including the dissent \nhere\u2014have analyzed the issue in depth. See, e.g., \nApp.93a-94a; Mayo, 914 N.W.2d at 697-705 (Grassl \nBradley, J., concurring); State v. Grevious, 223 N.E.3d \n323, 343 (Ohio 2022) (DeWine, J., concurring in judg-\nment); Hilburn, 442 P.3d at 526-531 (Stegall, J., con-\ncurring in part); Island County, 955 P.2d at 384 (Sand-\ners, J., concurring). Where a split is already clear, this \nCourt does not require the challenged decision to dis-\ncuss it in treatise-level detail. \nIII. This case presents an excellent vehicle to \naddress \nthese \nquestions \nof \nnationwide \nimportance. \nBoth questions presented are of nationwide im-\nportance, and both can be squarely addressed in this \nappeal. \n1. The first question presented concerns an issue of \nnationwide importance, demonstrated not least by the \nfact that 47 states have identical or near-identical \nstatutory language. Pet.6 n.1. If the Wisconsin Su-\npreme Court\u2019s decision is allowed to stand, religious \norganizations of all stripes in Wisconsin will be di-\n\n10 \n \nrectly and negatively affected. And because the rele-\nvant statutory language is identical across so many ju-\nrisdictions, Wisconsin\u2019s rule promises to find traction \nin other states as well.  \nMoreover, because the religious entities affected of-\nten operate on shoestring budgets, adoption of the \nWisconsin rule will have an outsize effect on the abil-\nity of these organizations to continue serving the \nneedy. Indeed, as the many amici explain, minority re-\nligious groups, whose religious practices are often un-\nfamiliar to nonadherents, will face \u201cdisproportionate[ ] \ndisadvantage.\u201d ISKCON Br.4. See also Jewish Coali-\ntion Br.1-4, 6-15 (\u201cthe State\u2019s \u2018true religiosity\u2019 test sys-\ntematically harms minority religions like Judaism\u201d); \nLCMS Br.14-16 (describing effects of Wisconsin rule \non variety of religions). In short, the First Amendment \nis of vital importance and the lower court\u2019s interpreta-\ntion represents a grave threat to its application. \nMore broadly, whether government can properly \nclassify specific behaviors as objectively religious or \nnonreligious, as opposed to beliefs, is an important and \nrecurring one. See, e.g., Thomas v. Review Bd., 450 \nU.S. 707, 718-719 (1981) (discussing termination of \nemployment for \u201c\u2018personal\u2019 reasons\u201d or for \u201creligious \nreasons\u201d); cf. Wisconsin v. Yoder, 406 U.S. 205, 216 \n(1972) (\u2018Thoreau\u2019s choice was philosophical and per-\nsonal rather than religious, and such belief does not \nrise to the demands of the Religion Clauses.\u201d). Thus \ndrinking wine can be a religious act based not on some-\nthing inherent to the behavior, but on the web of belief \nthat surrounds the act. Drinking a cup of wine at a \nPassover seder has profound importance because of \nthe relevant context of belief; by contrast, drinking a \ncup of wine on an airplane flight would (normally) \n\n11 \n \nhave no religious significance. That broader and very \nimportant question is directly implicated by the Wis-\nconsin Supreme Court\u2019s rule. Indeed, \u201cWisconsin\u2019s test \nis a blueprint for undermining religious exemptions \nacross the board.\u201d Religious Scholars Br.15. \n2. The second question presented is also of nation-\nwide importance\u2014by virtue of the importance of the \nburden of proof in deciding constitutional claims. \nWhether a federal constitutional claim must be proven \nbeyond a reasonable doubt, by clear and convincing ev-\nidence, or some other standard is of utmost importance \nto the outcome of individual cases and entire areas of \njurisprudence. See, e.g., Heller v. Doe, 509 U.S. 312, \n325 \n(1993) \n(distinguishing \nclear-and-convincing \nstandard from beyond-a-reasonable-doubt standard in \nthe context of an Equal Protection challenge to mental \nillness commitment proceedings); Anderson v. Liberty \nLobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 252-253 (1986) (discussing \nimportance of following the proper standard of proof \non summary judgment). And there is also good reason \nto end the disjunct caused by having different stand-\nards for federal claims in federal and state courts, not \nleast to avoid incentives to forum-shop. Pet.35. This \ncase presents an opportunity to remove this anomaly \nin the law. \n3. This appeal is also an excellent vehicle for resolv-\ning both questions presented. It includes a robust rec-\nord that will allow the Court to fully review both ques-\ntions. And the Wisconsin Supreme Court directly ad-\ndressed both questions presented, so there are no ob-\nstacles to reaching and resolving both. \nWisconsin\u2019s only anti-vehicle argument concerns \nthe second question presented, and rests entirely on \nits mistaken premise that the Wisconsin Supreme \n\n12 \n \nCourt did not address the beyond-a-reasonable-doubt \nstandard. BIO.25. But as noted above, the lower court \nmade a point of invoking the standard and repeating \nit at every turn of the decision. And Wisconsin says \nnothing at all about the fact that this Court has al-\nready twice found the first question presented cert-\nworthy. Pet.7-8 (discussing St. Martin and Grace \nBrethren).  \nCONCLUSION \nThe petition should be granted. \nRespectfully submitted. \n \n \nERIC C. RASSBACH \n   Counsel of Record \nNICHOLAS R.

The Wisconsin \nSupreme Court deepened an existing split among \nlower courts over whether government violates the \nFirst Amendment when it decides that an admittedly \nreligious charity is not religious enough to merit equal \ntreatment under state FUTA-compliant tax exemption \nstatutes. And the Wisconsin Supreme Court also ex-\ntended a separate split over whether federal constitu-\ntional claims must be proven beyond a reasonable \ndoubt. Both questions are of nationwide importance, \nand this case gives the Court the perfect vehicle to ad-\ndress them.  \nThis Court should therefore intervene to vindicate \nthe First Amendment. Wisconsin should not be al-\nlowed to deny Catholic Charities and religious organi-\nzations like it an exemption just because\u2014as required \nby their faith\u2014they serve all people.  \nARGUMENT \nI. Only this Court can resolve the split over the \nFirst Amendment\u2019s application to FUTA-\ncompliant tax exemption statutes. \nState supreme courts are split 4-4 over whether \nthey can, consonant with the First Amendment, deny \na religious organization a religious tax exemption be-\ncause the organization does not engage in \u201ctypical\u201d re-\nligious activities\u2014like worship or proselytizing. \nPet.15-23. Respondents don\u2019t dispute that the Wiscon-\nsin Supreme Court recharacterized Petitioners\u2019 reli-\ngious exercise as primarily secular activity. Instead, \nthey try to minimize the split by pointing to irrelevant \nfacts and quibbling over the merits. Neither gambit \n\n2 \n \ndetracts from the need for this Court to resolve this \nimportant question of constitutional law. \nA. Courts are hopelessly split over whether \nreligious organizations can be denied a \nreligious tax exemption because their \nbehavior is not \u201ctypical\u201d enough to qualify. \n1. Respondents first say there is no split because \nsome state supreme courts didn\u2019t directly address \n\u201cFirst Amendment issues.\u201d BIO.8. Instead, Respond-\nents claim, these courts were merely interpreting \nFUTA-compliant state laws. Ibid. \nRespondents are wrong. As Petitioners explained, \nseveral cases in the split engaged in constitutional \nanalysis or (for the courts that came out the right way) \nsimply didn\u2019t need to reach any constitutional ques-\ntions. Pet.18, 20, 21, 23. And, more importantly, a \nstate court need not analyze the Constitution for its \ninterpretation of state law to violate the Constitution. \nIf Respondents were right, the simplest way for a court \nto certiorari-proof its opinion would be to ignore the \nConstitution altogether. That\u2019s obviously wrong. This \nCourt has \u201can obligation to ensure that state court in-\nterpretations of [state] law do not evade federal law.\u201d \nMoore v. Harper, 600 U.S. 1, 34 (2023). And here, there \nis no question that the decisions on the wrong side of \nthe split are not consistent with the demands of the \nFirst Amendment. Pet.23-30. \n2. Respondents next suggest that all courts in the \nsplit are applying the same standard. BIO.12. That \nblinks reality: The split has been acknowledged re-\npeatedly\u2014including in Terwilliger, Mid Vermont \nChristian School, and again in the decision below. \n\n3 \n \nPet.19 n.4. (Mid Vermont); Pet.21 (Terwilliger); \nApp.142a (this case). \nLooking for keys under the streetlight, Respond-\nents scour the opinions on the correct side of the split \nfor evidence of any religious activity, on the theory \nthat\u2014rather than looking at religious motivation or \nmission\u2014these courts instead balanced religious ac-\ntivities against secular activities and determined that \nthe religious activities predominated. BIO.13. But \nthat\u2019s not what they did, and Defendants\u2019 scattershot \nfactual citations tell us nothing about the legal stand-\nard these courts applied. \nIdaho. Respondents suggest that Champion Bake-\nN-Serve independently considered the bakery\u2019s activi-\nties because its analysis distinguished between full-\ntime employees and students receiving \u201creligious \ntraining\u201d through their work at the bakery. BIO.12-13. \nNot so\u2014the court concluded that the bakery\u2019s motiva-\ntion for employing students was primarily religious \n(because it viewed their work as religiously moti-\nvated). Department of Emp. v. Champion Bake-N-\nServe, Inc., 592 P.2d 1370, 1371-1372 (1979). That\u2019s \nfully consistent with the separate conclusion that the \nbakery might have had a different motivation for em-\nploying other employees. Ibid. And, contra BIO.13, \nNampa Christian similarly supports Petitioners. \nThere, the court looked to the school\u2019s \u201cintent and op-\nerations\u201d merely as evidence \u201creveal[ing]\u201d its \u201creligious \nmission and purpose.\u201d Nampa Christian Schs. Found., \nInc. v. State, 719 P.2d 1178, 1183 (Idaho 1986) (em-\nphasis added).  \nIowa. Respondents note that the religious school \nin Community Lutheran included religion in its curric-\nulum and required its teachers to be Lutheran. \n\n4 \n \nBIO.13. This tells us nothing about the legal standard \nthe court applied. And even a cursory review of the \nopinion shows that the court applied the correct stand-\nard\u2014expressly citing Champion Bake-N-Serve. See \nCommunity Lutheran Sch. v. Iowa Dep\u2019t of Job Serv., \n326 N.W.2d 286, 291 (Iowa 1982). \nMaine. The facts identified by Respondents in \nSchwartz v. Unemployment Insurance Commission \nsimilarly served as evidence of the organization\u2019s reli-\ngious motivations\u2014not as part of a supposed secular-\nversus-religious-activities balancing test. Indeed, af-\nter citing Kendall, the court explained that the Cen-\nter\u2019s outwardly secular activities (like its after-school \nprogram) did not at all \u201cdiminish its continuing reli-\ngious purpose.\u201d 895 A.2d 965, 970-971 (Me. 2006). \nMassachusetts. Even odder, Respondents claim \nKendall \u201cdid not rely on religious motivations alone.\u201d \nBIO.13. But, citing Champion Bake-N-Serve, the court \ntreated religious \u201cmotive\u201d and religious \u201cpurpose\u201d as \ntwo variations on the same idea. Kendall v. Director of \nDiv. of Emp. Sec., 473 N.E.2d 196, 199 (Mass. 1985). \nHere too, the facts Respondents flag, BIO.13, did not \nindependently drive the analysis; they supported the \nconclusion that the Center\u2019s ministry was religiously \nmotivated. Kendall, 473 N.E.2d at 199.  \nIn short, the fact that the religiously motivated en-\ntities in these cases unsurprisingly engaged in some \n\n5 \n \nreligious activities Wisconsin deems sufficiently \u201ctypi-\ncal\u201d tells us nothing about the legal standard the \ncourts applied.1 \n3. Finally, respondents suggest that their approach \nis \u201cconsistent\u201d with FUTA\u2019s legislative history. \nBIO.14. But, as an initial matter, this Court isn\u2019t being \nasked to interpret congressional intent at all. Instead, \nthis Court has been presented with a decision defini-\ntively interpreting Wisconsin law. The question is \nwhether that interpretation complies with the First \nAmendment. Because Congress lacks the authority to \neither definitively interpret Wisconsin law or the First \nAmendment, Congress\u2019 intent is beside the point. And, \nregardless, this Court in St. Martin (a case Respond-\nents all but ignore), considered the same legislative \nhistory cited by Respondents and gave it minimal \nweight. See St. Martin Evangelical Lutheran Church \nv. South Dakota, 451 U.S. 772, 782, 786-788 (1981); \nsee id. at 790-791 (Stevens, J., concurring) (\u201cthere is \nspecial force to the rule that the plain statutory lan-\nguage should control\u201d). \nB. The decision below violates the First \nAmendment. \nThe approach taken by the Wisconsin Supreme \nCourt and defended by Respondents violates the First \nAmendment thrice over. Pet.23-31. Respondents claim \ntheir position is consistent with the Constitution. \nBIO.15-19. A fuller response can be saved for the mer-\nits, but Petitioners offer a few points here. \n \n1  \nRespondents\u2019 attempts to distinguish the intermediate appel-\nlate court opinions fail for the same reason. Compare Pet.19-20 \nwith BIO.13-14.  \n\n6 \n \nFirst, Respondents never dispute, and thus con-\ncede, that their test favors some religious beliefs over \nothers. Pet.23-26. Instead, Respondents excuse the un-\nequal treatment by arguing that the law doesn\u2019t bur-\nden Petitioners. BIO.17-19. But Respondents\u2019 argu-\nment is as outdated as their precedent. Unequal denial \nof a benefit is a textbook burden on Free Exercise \nrights. E.g., Trinity Lutheran Church of Columbia, \nInc. v. Comer, 582 U.S. 449, 463 (2017). And here there \nis a burden because Wisconsin is denying Petitioners \nan exemption. \nSecond, Respondents claim there is no excessive \nentanglement because Wisconsin \u201caccepted\u201d Petition-\ners\u2019 beliefs and only \u201crelied on [Catholic Charities\u2019] \n\u2018primarily charitable and secular\u2019 activities\u201d to per-\nform its analysis. BIO.16. But that begs the question. \nDetermining whether various activities\u2014like feeding \nthe hungry\u2014are inherently secular or religious is the \nexcessive entanglement. Pet.27-29.  \nThird, Respondents argue that this case is \u201cnothing \nlike\u201d Kedroff because it does not involve matters which \n\u201cbelong to the church alone.\u201d BIO.17. But the principle \nof church autonomy articulated in Kedroff ensures \nthat secular authorities don\u2019t interfere with matters of \nchurch governance and organization. Pet.29-30. Here, \nRespondents never dispute that Wisconsin\u2019s rule fa-\nvors certain types of church structures over others\u2014or \nthat only exclusively religious activity counts. Ibid. \nII. Lower courts are split over whether federal \nconstitutional \nclaims \nmust \nbe \nproven \n\u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d \nOver a strong dissent, the Wisconsin Supreme \nCourt emphasized\u2014seven times\u2014that it was applying \n\n7 \n \na \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d standard. App.7a, 37a, \n44a, 47a, 50a, 51a; see also 93a-94a (Grassl Bradley, \nJ., dissenting). That standard is both wrong and at \nodds with the approach taken by this Court and other \nfederal courts. These courts, if they apply a burden of \nproving unconstitutionality at all, employ a much \nlower \u201cplain showing\u201d or \u201cclearly demonstrated\u201d stand-\nard. Pet.31. \n1. Respondents agree that the Wisconsin Supreme \nCourt applied the \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d stand-\nard. BIO.24. Yet, as they do not dispute, this Court \nlong ago abandoned that standard. The most recent \nreference Respondents identify is over 100 years old. \nBIO.21 (citing Adkins v. Children\u2019s Hosp. of D.C., 261 \nU.S. 525, 544 (1923)). And the only other federal court \nthey cite picks up this standard from a state supreme \ncourt. BIO.22 (quoting Dutra v. Trustees of Bos. Univ., \n96 F.4th 15, 20 (1st Cir. 2024) (quoting Leibovich v. \nAntonellis, 574 N.E.2d 978, 984 (Mass. 1991))). \nRespondents thus concede that different courts \nhave adopted different formulations of the legal stand-\nard\u2014they just claim that this variation is unim-\nportant. BIO.20-21. But precision of language matters, \nespecially when it comes to standards of proof. A nar-\nrow win under one standard can become a loss under \na more stringent standard. E.g., Hilburn v. Enerpipe \nLtd., 442 P.3d 509, 527-528 (Kan. 2019) (Stegall, J., \nconcurring in part) (difference between de novo and \n\u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d standards outcome-deter-\nminative); Island County v. State, 955 P.2d 377, 388 \n(Wash. 1998) (Sanders, J., concurring) (similar discus-\nsion).  \nFurthermore, if Respondents\u2019 argument is that \u201cbe-\nyond a reasonable doubt\u201d doesn\u2019t really mean \u201cbeyond \n\n8 \n \na reasonable doubt,\u201d BIO.23-24 (standard is \u201cnot the \nhigh burden of proof it represents in the criminal-law \ncontext\u201d), that concession alone is reason to grant re-\nview. Two different standards of proof traveling under \nthe same name is a recipe for lower court confusion \nand inconsistent application of the civil rights laws.  \nNor does Respondents\u2019 argument make sense of \nthis case. Even if many states treat the standard as \n\u201chortatory,\u201d Wisconsin stands among the small group \nthat applies the \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d in a way \nthat is often dispositive of federal constitutional \nclaims. The Wisconsin Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in this \ncase serves as an exemplar. Pet.33-34. And, tellingly, \nRespondents do not engage with the opinion below or \neven cite the other Wisconsin cases applying the same \nstandard. Compare BIO.22, 24 with Pet.34. Like the \nmajority below, Respondents also do not substantively \nengage the dissenting opinion, which explained how \nthe majority \u201cstack[ed] the deck against Catholic \nCharities\u2019 claims under the Religion Clauses from the \noutset.\u201d App.93a. They instead cite Mayo, BIO.23, but \nfail to mention that the separate writing in Mayo iden-\ntifies this exact split. See Mayo v. Wisconsin Injured \nPatients & Families Comp. Fund, 914 N.W.2d 678, 700 \n(Wis. 2018) (Grassl Bradley, J., concurring). \n2. Respondents\u2019 fallback position is that this case is \nnot the right vehicle for this Court to consider the is-\nsue because Petitioners failed to raise a challenge to \nthe standard below. BIO.25. But before the Wisconsin \nSupreme Court used it, no other adjudicator through \nfive levels of review had mentioned\u2014much less ap-\nplied\u2014\u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d See BIO.24 (ac-\nknowledging that the Wisconsin Court of Appeals did \n\n9 \n \nnot use the \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d standard). Pe-\ntitioners are not charged with prescience about what \nerroneous standards a court might invoke; it suffices \nto mount a challenge to a wrongheaded standard at \nthe first opportunity.  \nRespondents also say that the opinion below pro-\nvides inadequate discussion for this Court to resolve \nthe issue. BIO.20. But the opinion below is utterly typ-\nical of how state courts misuse the \u201cbeyond a reasona-\nble doubt\u201d standard to minimize federal constitutional \nrights. And many jurists\u2014including the dissent \nhere\u2014have analyzed the issue in depth. See, e.g., \nApp.93a-94a; Mayo, 914 N.W.2d at 697-705 (Grassl \nBradley, J., concurring); State v. Grevious, 223 N.E.3d \n323, 343 (Ohio 2022) (DeWine, J., concurring in judg-\nment); Hilburn, 442 P.3d at 526-531 (Stegall, J., con-\ncurring in part); Island County, 955 P.2d at 384 (Sand-\ners, J., concurring). Where a split is already clear, this \nCourt does not require the challenged decision to dis-\ncuss it in treatise-level detail. \nIII. This case presents an excellent vehicle to \naddress \nthese \nquestions \nof \nnationwide \nimportance. \nBoth questions presented are of nationwide im-\nportance, and both can be squarely addressed in this \nappeal. \n1. The first question presented concerns an issue of \nnationwide importance, demonstrated not least by the \nfact that 47 states have identical or near-identical \nstatutory language. Pet.6 n.1. If the Wisconsin Su-\npreme Court\u2019s decision is allowed to stand, religious \norganizations of all stripes in Wisconsin will be di-\n\n10 \n \nrectly and negatively affected. And because the rele-\nvant statutory language is identical across so many ju-\nrisdictions, Wisconsin\u2019s rule promises to find traction \nin other states as well.  \nMoreover, because the religious entities affected of-\nten operate on shoestring budgets, adoption of the \nWisconsin rule will have an outsize effect on the abil-\nity of these organizations to continue serving the \nneedy. Indeed, as the many amici explain, minority re-\nligious groups, whose religious practices are often un-\nfamiliar to nonadherents, will face \u201cdisproportionate[ ] \ndisadvantage.\u201d ISKCON Br.4. See also Jewish Coali-\ntion Br.1-4, 6-15 (\u201cthe State\u2019s \u2018true religiosity\u2019 test sys-\ntematically harms minority religions like Judaism\u201d); \nLCMS Br.14-16 (describing effects of Wisconsin rule \non variety of religions). In short, the First Amendment \nis of vital importance and the lower court\u2019s interpreta-\ntion represents a grave threat to its application. \nMore broadly, whether government can properly \nclassify specific behaviors as objectively religious or \nnonreligious, as opposed to beliefs, is an important and \nrecurring one. See, e.g., Thomas v. Review Bd., 450 \nU.S. 707, 718-719 (1981) (discussing termination of \nemployment for \u201c\u2018personal\u2019 reasons\u201d or for \u201creligious \nreasons\u201d); cf. Wisconsin v. Yoder, 406 U.S. 205, 216 \n(1972) (\u2018Thoreau\u2019s choice was philosophical and per-\nsonal rather than religious, and such belief does not \nrise to the demands of the Religion Clauses.\u201d). Thus \ndrinking wine can be a religious act based not on some-\nthing inherent to the behavior, but on the web of belief \nthat surrounds the act. Drinking a cup of wine at a \nPassover seder has profound importance because of \nthe relevant context of belief; by contrast, drinking a \ncup of wine on an airplane flight would (normally) \n\n11 \n \nhave no religious significance. That broader and very \nimportant question is directly implicated by the Wis-\nconsin Supreme Court\u2019s rule. Indeed, \u201cWisconsin\u2019s test \nis a blueprint for undermining religious exemptions \nacross the board.\u201d Religious Scholars Br.15. \n2. The second question presented is also of nation-\nwide importance\u2014by virtue of the importance of the \nburden of proof in deciding constitutional claims. \nWhether a federal constitutional claim must be proven \nbeyond a reasonable doubt, by clear and convincing ev-\nidence, or some other standard is of utmost importance \nto the outcome of individual cases and entire areas of \njurisprudence. See, e.g., Heller v. Doe, 509 U.S. 312, \n325 \n(1993) \n(distinguishing \nclear-and-convincing \nstandard from beyond-a-reasonable-doubt standard in \nthe context of an Equal Protection challenge to mental \nillness commitment proceedings); Anderson v. Liberty \nLobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 252-253 (1986) (discussing \nimportance of following the proper standard of proof \non summary judgment). And there is also good reason \nto end the disjunct caused by having different stand-\nards for federal claims in federal and state courts, not \nleast to avoid incentives to forum-shop. Pet.35. This \ncase presents an opportunity to remove this anomaly \nin the law. \n3. This appeal is also an excellent vehicle for resolv-\ning both questions presented. It includes a robust rec-\nord that will allow the Court to fully review both ques-\ntions. And the Wisconsin Supreme Court directly ad-\ndressed both questions presented, so there are no ob-\nstacles to reaching and resolving both. \nWisconsin\u2019s only anti-vehicle argument concerns \nthe second question presented, and rests entirely on \nits mistaken premise that the Wisconsin Supreme \n\n12 \n \nCourt did not address the beyond-a-reasonable-doubt \nstandard. BIO.25. But as noted above, the lower court \nmade a point of invoking the standard and repeating \nit at every turn of the decision. And Wisconsin says \nnothing at all about the fact that this Court has al-\nready twice found the first question presented cert-\nworthy. Pet.7-8 (discussing St. Martin and Grace \nBrethren).  \nCONCLUSION \nThe petition should be granted. \nRespectfully submitted. \n \n \nERIC C. RASSBACH \n   Counsel of Record \nNICHOLAS R.

This document is the key to understanding whether CCB will double down on their broad constitutional arguments or pivot to embrace the Solicitor General's (SG) narrower statutory \"off-ramp.\" The current observation was a strategic pause to plan a better way to acquire this exact information, confirming its paramount importance.\n*   **Stable Model of Potential Outcomes:** My model of the three decision paths remains the same, awaiting the crucial input from the reply brief:\n    1.  **Broad Free Exercise Ruling:** The Court sides with CCB's primary arguments on church autonomy, entanglement, and discrimination, potentially setting a major precedent.\n    2.  **Narrow Statutory Ruling:** The Court adopts the SG's argument, avoiding the constitutional questions entirely.\n    3.  **Constitutional Avoidance Ruling:** A hybrid approach where the Court uses principles of constitutional avoidance to justify a narrow statutory interpretation.\n*   **Cumulative Case Knowledge:** My understanding of the petitioner's initial strategy, based on their opening brief, is solid. They launched a comprehensive constitutional attack citing precedents like *Hosanna-Tabor*, *Carson v. Makin*, and *Fulton*. This forms the baseline against which their reaction to the SG's brief will be measured.",
          "design_beliefs": "This observation, being an act of pure self-correction and strategic planning, provides a significant update to my design-level beliefs. It refines my understanding of how to interact with my information-gathering tools and reinforces the importance of a deliberate, iterative research process.\n\n1.  **Source Prioritization Heuristic (Multi-Stage):** This model remains robust. The current impasse validates the model's structure: I have analyzed a Stage 2 (Opening Salvo) and Stage 3 (Influential Amicus) document, and the unresolved tension between them proves that the Stage 4 (Reaction and Final Framing) document\u2014the reply brief\u2014is essential for a complete picture.\n2.  **Contextual Analysis via Precedent Mapping:** Stable. The map of precedents from the petitioner's brief (*Hosanna-Tabor*, *Carson*, *Fulton*, etc.) is the established foundation for the constitutional side of the case.\n3.  **Legal Briefs as Strategic Data:** Stable and reinforced. The intense focus on acquiring the reply brief underscores the belief that these documents are not just arguments but data points revealing a litigant's evolving strategy in response to their opponent and influential amici.\n4.  **Search Strategy Resilience (Further Refinement):** This principle has evolved significantly.\n    *   *Initial Belief:* Simple keyword searches are sufficient.\n    *   *After Last Observation:* Simple keyword searches are imprecise and can fail. More specific queries or post-search verification are needed.\n    *   *Current Belief:* The relationship between query specificity and search tool effectiveness is complex. The previous failure showed that an *overly specific* filter (`{'proceeding_title': 'reply brief of petitioners'}`) can be just as ineffective as a vague one, likely due to the tool's fuzzy matching algorithm. The refined strategy is to identify a single, uniquely identifying term (like \"reply\" for a reply brief) and use that as a simple but powerful filter. The goal is to find the \"sweet spot\" of specificity that is robust to the tool's quirks.\n5.  **Systematic Uncertainty Reduction (Process in Action):** The `Assess -> Identify -> Target -> Verify` loop is not just a theoretical model; I am actively executing it. The previous failed search was a `Target` action. This `THINK` observation represents a return to the `Assess` and `Identify` stages to diagnose the failure and plan a new, more robust `Target` action. This demonstrates the iterative and self-correcting nature of the process.\n6.  **The \"Reframing\" Heuristic:** Stable. The entire exercise is currently focused on detecting a potential \"reframe\" from the petitioner's initial constitutional argument to the SG's statutory one.\n7.  **The \"Influential Amicus\" Heuristic:** Stable. The SG's influence remains the central dynamic of the case at this stage.\n8.  **Cross-Brief Signal Analysis:** Stable. The goal remains to analyze the signal from the reply brief in the context of the previously analyzed opening and amicus briefs.\n9.  **The \"Off-Ramp\" Heuristic:** Stable. This remains the key heuristic for understanding the potential for a narrow ruling, but it is still an untested hypothesis. Acquiring the reply brief is the experiment designed to test it.\n10. **Litigation as a Sequential Game:** Stable and reinforced. This `THINK` step is a pause to ensure I can acquire the next move in the game in its proper sequence.\n11. **Action Outcome Verification:** Strongly reinforced. The internal reasoning in this observation is a direct consequence of applying this principle. The failure was detected because I verified the outcome of the last search, which triggered this entire corrective process. This confirms verification is not an optional step but a core component of reliable information gathering."

This observation provided a key historical document but failed to deliver the dispositive evidence I sought.\n\n*   **Stable Predictive Outlook:** My high-confidence prediction that Catholic Charities Bureau (CCB) will prevail remains unchanged. The core uncertainty about the *reasoning* for that victory (broad vs. narrow) is now more acute due to the failure to acquire the key piece of evidence.\n*   **Unresolved Central Uncertainty (Intensified):** My entire analysis has been predicated on finding the petitioner's *merits-stage* reply brief to see their reaction to the Solicitor General's (SG) statutory \"off-ramp\" argument. This search action failed to retrieve that document. Instead, it retrieved the *certiorari-stage* reply brief (filed November 2024). This document predates the SG's involvement and therefore cannot answer my question. The inability to resolve this question after a targeted search intensifies its importance; it is the single point of failure in my predictive model right now.\n*   **New Cumulative Case Knowledge (Certiorari Strategy):** I have now analyzed the petitioner's cert-stage reply brief. This document confirms their initial strategy was a full-throated constitutional attack. They argued for certiorari by:\n    *   Asserting a \"hopelessly split\" 4-4 division among state supreme courts on whether the First Amendment permits denying a tax exemption based on a state's judgment of what constitutes \"typical\" religious activity.\n    *   Directly refuting the respondent's claim that the split was not constitutional in nature, citing *Moore v. Harper* for the principle that state court interpretations can't evade federal law.\n    *   Framing the Wisconsin court's decision as a threefold First Amendment violation: denominational preference (violating *Trinity Lutheran*), excessive entanglement, and violation of church autonomy (*Kedroff*).\n    *   Highlighting a second split over whether federal constitutional claims must be proven \"beyond a reasonable doubt.\"\n    This confirms the baseline: CCB's entry into the Supreme Court was based entirely on broad, significant constitutional questions.\n*   **Stable Model of Potential Outcomes:** My model of the three decision paths remains the only way to frame the outcome, but I have no new evidence to shift the probabilities between them. The missing merits-stage reply brief is the key that unlocks this model.\n    1.  **Broad Free Exercise Ruling:** Based on CCB's initial arguments, as confirmed by the cert-stage reply.\n    2.  **Narrow Statutory Ruling:** Based on the SG's \"off-ramp\" argument.\n    3.  **Constitutional Avoidance Ruling:** A hybrid approach.",
          "design_beliefs": "This observation, a failed attempt to acquire a specific document, provides a crucial lesson in the nuance of legal research and significantly refines my information-gathering methodology.\n\n1.  **Source Prioritization Heuristic (Refined for Litigation Stages):** My multi-stage model is correct but was insufficiently granular. I have now learned that documents with the same name (e.g., \"Reply Brief\") serve different strategic functions at different stages. The model must be refined to distinguish between the *certiorari stage* and the *merits stage*.\n    *   *Previous Belief:* Stage 4 was the \"Reaction and Final Framing\" document.\n    *   *Current Belief:* The process is more discrete: Cert Petition -> Cert Opposition -> **Cert Reply (to get the grant)** -> Merits Brief -> Respondent/Amicus Briefs -> **Merits Reply (to win the case)**. I found the Cert Reply when I needed the Merits Reply. My prioritization must now account for these distinct stages.\n2.  **Search Strategy Resilience (Major Refinement):** My strategy has evolved again.\n    *   *Initial Belief:* Simple keyword searches are sufficient.\n    *   *Previous Belief:* Overly specific filters can fail; a single, unique term (`reply`) is a more robust filter.\n    *   *Current Belief:* A single unique term is insufficient when documents share names across litigation stages. The new strategy must incorporate stage-specific context. This can be done by looking for keywords in the document text (e.g., \"On Petition for a Writ of Certiorari\" vs. \"On Writ of Certiorari\") or by carefully examining metadata like filenames (`Cert20Reply`) and filing dates. The failure was not in the query's keyword, but in its lack of contextual specificity.\n3.  **Action Outcome Verification (Critically Reinforced):** This principle has proven to be indispensable. By not blindly accepting the search result titled \"REPLY BRIEF,\" and instead reading its full title and introduction, I identified that it was from the wrong stage of litigation. This prevented a catastrophic analytical error where I would have concluded the petitioners ignored the SG, when in reality, I was looking at a document written before the SG was even involved. Verification is not a final step; it is a continuous process of contextual validation.\n4.  **Systematic Uncertainty Reduction (Process in Action):** The `Assess -> Identify -> Target -> Verify` loop is working perfectly, demonstrating its self-correcting nature. The `Verify` step of this observation (realizing I had the wrong brief) immediately triggered a new `Assess` step (my search strategy is flawed) and an `Identify` step (I need the *merits-stage* brief, and I need a better way to find it). This iterative failure is leading to methodological improvement.\n5.  **Litigation as a Sequential Game (Refined):** I have a more granular map of the \"game board\" now. I understand the sequence of cert-stage moves and merits-stage moves as distinct phases. My previous view was too compressed. This observation was like finding a player's notes from an early round of a tournament when I needed to see their final-round strategy.\n6.  **The \"Off-Ramp\" Heuristic:** Stable. This remains the central, untested hypothesis driving the case analysis. The difficulty in acquiring the data to test it elevates its importance.\n7.  **Legal Briefs as Strategic Data:** Stable and reinforced. The cert-stage reply brief is a perfect example of a document tailored for a specific strategic goal: convincing four Justices that the case is important enough to hear. It is distinct from a merits brief, which is designed to convince five Justices to rule in one's favor.\n8.  **Contextual Analysis via Precedent Mapping:** Stable. The cert-stage reply adds *Trinity Lutheran* and *Moore v. Harper* to the map of key precedents CCB was relying on to get the case granted, reinforcing the constitutional nature of their initial push."

The Wisconsin \nSupreme Court deepened an existing split among \nlower courts over whether government violates the \nFirst Amendment when it decides that an admittedly \nreligious charity is not religious enough to merit equal \ntreatment under state FUTA-compliant tax exemption \nstatutes. And the Wisconsin Supreme Court also ex-\ntended a separate split over whether federal constitu-\ntional claims must be proven beyond a reasonable \ndoubt. Both questions are of nationwide importance, \nand this case gives the Court the perfect vehicle to ad-\ndress them.  \nThis Court should therefore intervene to vindicate \nthe First Amendment. Wisconsin should not be al-\nlowed to deny Catholic Charities and religious organi-\nzations like it an exemption just because\u2014as required \nby their faith\u2014they serve all people.  \nARGUMENT \nI. Only this Court can resolve the split over the \nFirst Amendment\u2019s application to FUTA-\ncompliant tax exemption statutes. \nState supreme courts are split 4-4 over whether \nthey can, consonant with the First Amendment, deny \na religious organization a religious tax exemption be-\ncause the organization does not engage in \u201ctypical\u201d re-\nligious activities\u2014like worship or proselytizing. \nPet.15-23. Respondents don\u2019t dispute that the Wiscon-\nsin Supreme Court recharacterized Petitioners\u2019 reli-\ngious exercise as primarily secular activity. Instead, \nthey try to minimize the split by pointing to irrelevant \nfacts and quibbling over the merits. Neither gambit \n\n2 \n \ndetracts from the need for this Court to resolve this \nimportant question of constitutional law. \nA. Courts are hopelessly split over whether \nreligious organizations can be denied a \nreligious tax exemption because their \nbehavior is not \u201ctypical\u201d enough to qualify. \n1. Respondents first say there is no split because \nsome state supreme courts didn\u2019t directly address \n\u201cFirst Amendment issues.\u201d BIO.8. Instead, Respond-\nents claim, these courts were merely interpreting \nFUTA-compliant state laws. Ibid. \nRespondents are wrong. As Petitioners explained, \nseveral cases in the split engaged in constitutional \nanalysis or (for the courts that came out the right way) \nsimply didn\u2019t need to reach any constitutional ques-\ntions. Pet.18, 20, 21, 23. And, more importantly, a \nstate court need not analyze the Constitution for its \ninterpretation of state law to violate the Constitution. \nIf Respondents were right, the simplest way for a court \nto certiorari-proof its opinion would be to ignore the \nConstitution altogether. That\u2019s obviously wrong. This \nCourt has \u201can obligation to ensure that state court in-\nterpretations of [state] law do not evade federal law.\u201d \nMoore v. Harper, 600 U.S. 1, 34 (2023). And here, there \nis no question that the decisions on the wrong side of \nthe split are not consistent with the demands of the \nFirst Amendment. Pet.23-30. \n2. Respondents next suggest that all courts in the \nsplit are applying the same standard. BIO.12. That \nblinks reality: The split has been acknowledged re-\npeatedly\u2014including in Terwilliger, Mid Vermont \nChristian School, and again in the decision below. \n\n3 \n \nPet.19 n.4. (Mid Vermont); Pet.21 (Terwilliger); \nApp.142a (this case). \nLooking for keys under the streetlight, Respond-\nents scour the opinions on the correct side of the split \nfor evidence of any religious activity, on the theory \nthat\u2014rather than looking at religious motivation or \nmission\u2014these courts instead balanced religious ac-\ntivities against secular activities and determined that \nthe religious activities predominated. BIO.13. But \nthat\u2019s not what they did, and Defendants\u2019 scattershot \nfactual citations tell us nothing about the legal stand-\nard these courts applied. \nIdaho. Respondents suggest that Champion Bake-\nN-Serve independently considered the bakery\u2019s activi-\nties because its analysis distinguished between full-\ntime employees and students receiving \u201creligious \ntraining\u201d through their work at the bakery. BIO.12-13. \nNot so\u2014the court concluded that the bakery\u2019s motiva-\ntion for employing students was primarily religious \n(because it viewed their work as religiously moti-\nvated). Department of Emp. v. Champion Bake-N-\nServe, Inc., 592 P.2d 1370, 1371-1372 (1979). That\u2019s \nfully consistent with the separate conclusion that the \nbakery might have had a different motivation for em-\nploying other employees. Ibid. And, contra BIO.13, \nNampa Christian similarly supports Petitioners. \nThere, the court looked to the school\u2019s \u201cintent and op-\nerations\u201d merely as evidence \u201creveal[ing]\u201d its \u201creligious \nmission and purpose.\u201d Nampa Christian Schs. Found., \nInc. v. State, 719 P.2d 1178, 1183 (Idaho 1986) (em-\nphasis added).  \nIowa. Respondents note that the religious school \nin Community Lutheran included religion in its curric-\nulum and required its teachers to be Lutheran. \n\n4 \n \nBIO.13. This tells us nothing about the legal standard \nthe court applied. And even a cursory review of the \nopinion shows that the court applied the correct stand-\nard\u2014expressly citing Champion Bake-N-Serve. See \nCommunity Lutheran Sch. v. Iowa Dep\u2019t of Job Serv., \n326 N.W.2d 286, 291 (Iowa 1982). \nMaine. The facts identified by Respondents in \nSchwartz v. Unemployment Insurance Commission \nsimilarly served as evidence of the organization\u2019s reli-\ngious motivations\u2014not as part of a supposed secular-\nversus-religious-activities balancing test. Indeed, af-\nter citing Kendall, the court explained that the Cen-\nter\u2019s outwardly secular activities (like its after-school \nprogram) did not at all \u201cdiminish its continuing reli-\ngious purpose.\u201d 895 A.2d 965, 970-971 (Me. 2006). \nMassachusetts. Even odder, Respondents claim \nKendall \u201cdid not rely on religious motivations alone.\u201d \nBIO.13. But, citing Champion Bake-N-Serve, the court \ntreated religious \u201cmotive\u201d and religious \u201cpurpose\u201d as \ntwo variations on the same idea. Kendall v. Director of \nDiv. of Emp. Sec., 473 N.E.2d 196, 199 (Mass. 1985). \nHere too, the facts Respondents flag, BIO.13, did not \nindependently drive the analysis; they supported the \nconclusion that the Center\u2019s ministry was religiously \nmotivated. Kendall, 473 N.E.2d at 199.  \nIn short, the fact that the religiously motivated en-\ntities in these cases unsurprisingly engaged in some \n\n5 \n \nreligious activities Wisconsin deems sufficiently \u201ctypi-\ncal\u201d tells us nothing about the legal standard the \ncourts applied.1 \n3. Finally, respondents suggest that their approach \nis \u201cconsistent\u201d with FUTA\u2019s legislative history. \nBIO.14. But, as an initial matter, this Court isn\u2019t being \nasked to interpret congressional intent at all. Instead, \nthis Court has been presented with a decision defini-\ntively interpreting Wisconsin law. The question is \nwhether that interpretation complies with the First \nAmendment. Because Congress lacks the authority to \neither definitively interpret Wisconsin law or the First \nAmendment, Congress\u2019 intent is beside the point. And, \nregardless, this Court in St. Martin (a case Respond-\nents all but ignore), considered the same legislative \nhistory cited by Respondents and gave it minimal \nweight. See St. Martin Evangelical Lutheran Church \nv. South Dakota, 451 U.S. 772, 782, 786-788 (1981); \nsee id. at 790-791 (Stevens, J., concurring) (\u201cthere is \nspecial force to the rule that the plain statutory lan-\nguage should control\u201d). \nB. The decision below violates the First \nAmendment. \nThe approach taken by the Wisconsin Supreme \nCourt and defended by Respondents violates the First \nAmendment thrice over. Pet.23-31. Respondents claim \ntheir position is consistent with the Constitution. \nBIO.15-19. A fuller response can be saved for the mer-\nits, but Petitioners offer a few points here. \n \n1  \nRespondents\u2019 attempts to distinguish the intermediate appel-\nlate court opinions fail for the same reason. Compare Pet.19-20 \nwith BIO.13-14.  \n\n6 \n \nFirst, Respondents never dispute, and thus con-\ncede, that their test favors some religious beliefs over \nothers. Pet.23-26. Instead, Respondents excuse the un-\nequal treatment by arguing that the law doesn\u2019t bur-\nden Petitioners. BIO.17-19. But Respondents\u2019 argu-\nment is as outdated as their precedent. Unequal denial \nof a benefit is a textbook burden on Free Exercise \nrights. E.g., Trinity Lutheran Church of Columbia, \nInc. v. Comer, 582 U.S. 449, 463 (2017). And here there \nis a burden because Wisconsin is denying Petitioners \nan exemption. \nSecond, Respondents claim there is no excessive \nentanglement because Wisconsin \u201caccepted\u201d Petition-\ners\u2019 beliefs and only \u201crelied on [Catholic Charities\u2019] \n\u2018primarily charitable and secular\u2019 activities\u201d to per-\nform its analysis. BIO.16. But that begs the question. \nDetermining whether various activities\u2014like feeding \nthe hungry\u2014are inherently secular or religious is the \nexcessive entanglement. Pet.27-29.  \nThird, Respondents argue that this case is \u201cnothing \nlike\u201d Kedroff because it does not involve matters which \n\u201cbelong to the church alone.\u201d BIO.17. But the principle \nof church autonomy articulated in Kedroff ensures \nthat secular authorities don\u2019t interfere with matters of \nchurch governance and organization. Pet.29-30. Here, \nRespondents never dispute that Wisconsin\u2019s rule fa-\nvors certain types of church structures over others\u2014or \nthat only exclusively religious activity counts. Ibid. \nII. Lower courts are split over whether federal \nconstitutional \nclaims \nmust \nbe \nproven \n\u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d \nOver a strong dissent, the Wisconsin Supreme \nCourt emphasized\u2014seven times\u2014that it was applying \n\n7 \n \na \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d standard. App.7a, 37a, \n44a, 47a, 50a, 51a; see also 93a-94a (Grassl Bradley, \nJ., dissenting). That standard is both wrong and at \nodds with the approach taken by this Court and other \nfederal courts. These courts, if they apply a burden of \nproving unconstitutionality at all, employ a much \nlower \u201cplain showing\u201d or \u201cclearly demonstrated\u201d stand-\nard. Pet.31. \n1. Respondents agree that the Wisconsin Supreme \nCourt applied the \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d stand-\nard. BIO.24. Yet, as they do not dispute, this Court \nlong ago abandoned that standard. The most recent \nreference Respondents identify is over 100 years old. \nBIO.21 (citing Adkins v. Children\u2019s Hosp. of D.C., 261 \nU.S. 525, 544 (1923)). And the only other federal court \nthey cite picks up this standard from a state supreme \ncourt. BIO.22 (quoting Dutra v. Trustees of Bos. Univ., \n96 F.4th 15, 20 (1st Cir. 2024) (quoting Leibovich v. \nAntonellis, 574 N.E.2d 978, 984 (Mass. 1991))). \nRespondents thus concede that different courts \nhave adopted different formulations of the legal stand-\nard\u2014they just claim that this variation is unim-\nportant. BIO.20-21. But precision of language matters, \nespecially when it comes to standards of proof. A nar-\nrow win under one standard can become a loss under \na more stringent standard. E.g., Hilburn v. Enerpipe \nLtd., 442 P.3d 509, 527-528 (Kan. 2019) (Stegall, J., \nconcurring in part) (difference between de novo and \n\u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d standards outcome-deter-\nminative); Island County v. State, 955 P.2d 377, 388 \n(Wash. 1998) (Sanders, J., concurring) (similar discus-\nsion).  \nFurthermore, if Respondents\u2019 argument is that \u201cbe-\nyond a reasonable doubt\u201d doesn\u2019t really mean \u201cbeyond \n\n8 \n \na reasonable doubt,\u201d BIO.23-24 (standard is \u201cnot the \nhigh burden of proof it represents in the criminal-law \ncontext\u201d), that concession alone is reason to grant re-\nview. Two different standards of proof traveling under \nthe same name is a recipe for lower court confusion \nand inconsistent application of the civil rights laws.  \nNor does Respondents\u2019 argument make sense of \nthis case. Even if many states treat the standard as \n\u201chortatory,\u201d Wisconsin stands among the small group \nthat applies the \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d in a way \nthat is often dispositive of federal constitutional \nclaims. The Wisconsin Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in this \ncase serves as an exemplar. Pet.33-34. And, tellingly, \nRespondents do not engage with the opinion below or \neven cite the other Wisconsin cases applying the same \nstandard. Compare BIO.22, 24 with Pet.34. Like the \nmajority below, Respondents also do not substantively \nengage the dissenting opinion, which explained how \nthe majority \u201cstack[ed] the deck against Catholic \nCharities\u2019 claims under the Religion Clauses from the \noutset.\u201d App.93a. They instead cite Mayo, BIO.23, but \nfail to mention that the separate writing in Mayo iden-\ntifies this exact split. See Mayo v. Wisconsin Injured \nPatients & Families Comp. Fund, 914 N.W.2d 678, 700 \n(Wis. 2018) (Grassl Bradley, J., concurring). \n2. Respondents\u2019 fallback position is that this case is \nnot the right vehicle for this Court to consider the is-\nsue because Petitioners failed to raise a challenge to \nthe standard below. BIO.25. But before the Wisconsin \nSupreme Court used it, no other adjudicator through \nfive levels of review had mentioned\u2014much less ap-\nplied\u2014\u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d See BIO.24 (ac-\nknowledging that the Wisconsin Court of Appeals did \n\n9 \n \nnot use the \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d standard). Pe-\ntitioners are not charged with prescience about what \nerroneous standards a court might invoke; it suffices \nto mount a challenge to a wrongheaded standard at \nthe first opportunity.  \nRespondents also say that the opinion below pro-\nvides inadequate discussion for this Court to resolve \nthe issue. BIO.20. But the opinion below is utterly typ-\nical of how state courts misuse the \u201cbeyond a reasona-\nble doubt\u201d standard to minimize federal constitutional \nrights. And many jurists\u2014including the dissent \nhere\u2014have analyzed the issue in depth. See, e.g., \nApp.93a-94a; Mayo, 914 N.W.2d at 697-705 (Grassl \nBradley, J., concurring); State v. Grevious, 223 N.E.3d \n323, 343 (Ohio 2022) (DeWine, J., concurring in judg-\nment); Hilburn, 442 P.3d at 526-531 (Stegall, J., con-\ncurring in part); Island County, 955 P.2d at 384 (Sand-\ners, J., concurring). Where a split is already clear, this \nCourt does not require the challenged decision to dis-\ncuss it in treatise-level detail. \nIII. This case presents an excellent vehicle to \naddress \nthese \nquestions \nof \nnationwide \nimportance. \nBoth questions presented are of nationwide im-\nportance, and both can be squarely addressed in this \nappeal. \n1. The first question presented concerns an issue of \nnationwide importance, demonstrated not least by the \nfact that 47 states have identical or near-identical \nstatutory language. Pet.6 n.1. If the Wisconsin Su-\npreme Court\u2019s decision is allowed to stand, religious \norganizations of all stripes in Wisconsin will be di-\n\n10 \n \nrectly and negatively affected. And because the rele-\nvant statutory language is identical across so many ju-\nrisdictions, Wisconsin\u2019s rule promises to find traction \nin other states as well.  \nMoreover, because the religious entities affected of-\nten operate on shoestring budgets, adoption of the \nWisconsin rule will have an outsize effect on the abil-\nity of these organizations to continue serving the \nneedy. Indeed, as the many amici explain, minority re-\nligious groups, whose religious practices are often un-\nfamiliar to nonadherents, will face \u201cdisproportionate[ ] \ndisadvantage.\u201d ISKCON Br.4. See also Jewish Coali-\ntion Br.1-4, 6-15 (\u201cthe State\u2019s \u2018true religiosity\u2019 test sys-\ntematically harms minority religions like Judaism\u201d); \nLCMS Br.14-16 (describing effects of Wisconsin rule \non variety of religions). In short, the First Amendment \nis of vital importance and the lower court\u2019s interpreta-\ntion represents a grave threat to its application. \nMore broadly, whether government can properly \nclassify specific behaviors as objectively religious or \nnonreligious, as opposed to beliefs, is an important and \nrecurring one. See, e.g., Thomas v. Review Bd., 450 \nU.S. 707, 718-719 (1981) (discussing termination of \nemployment for \u201c\u2018personal\u2019 reasons\u201d or for \u201creligious \nreasons\u201d); cf. Wisconsin v. Yoder, 406 U.S. 205, 216 \n(1972) (\u2018Thoreau\u2019s choice was philosophical and per-\nsonal rather than religious, and such belief does not \nrise to the demands of the Religion Clauses.\u201d). Thus \ndrinking wine can be a religious act based not on some-\nthing inherent to the behavior, but on the web of belief \nthat surrounds the act. Drinking a cup of wine at a \nPassover seder has profound importance because of \nthe relevant context of belief; by contrast, drinking a \ncup of wine on an airplane flight would (normally) \n\n11 \n \nhave no religious significance. That broader and very \nimportant question is directly implicated by the Wis-\nconsin Supreme Court\u2019s rule. Indeed, \u201cWisconsin\u2019s test \nis a blueprint for undermining religious exemptions \nacross the board.\u201d Religious Scholars Br.15. \n2. The second question presented is also of nation-\nwide importance\u2014by virtue of the importance of the \nburden of proof in deciding constitutional claims. \nWhether a federal constitutional claim must be proven \nbeyond a reasonable doubt, by clear and convincing ev-\nidence, or some other standard is of utmost importance \nto the outcome of individual cases and entire areas of \njurisprudence. See, e.g., Heller v. Doe, 509 U.S. 312, \n325 \n(1993) \n(distinguishing \nclear-and-convincing \nstandard from beyond-a-reasonable-doubt standard in \nthe context of an Equal Protection challenge to mental \nillness commitment proceedings); Anderson v. Liberty \nLobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 252-253 (1986) (discussing \nimportance of following the proper standard of proof \non summary judgment). And there is also good reason \nto end the disjunct caused by having different stand-\nards for federal claims in federal and state courts, not \nleast to avoid incentives to forum-shop. Pet.35. This \ncase presents an opportunity to remove this anomaly \nin the law. \n3. This appeal is also an excellent vehicle for resolv-\ning both questions presented. It includes a robust rec-\nord that will allow the Court to fully review both ques-\ntions. And the Wisconsin Supreme Court directly ad-\ndressed both questions presented, so there are no ob-\nstacles to reaching and resolving both. \nWisconsin\u2019s only anti-vehicle argument concerns \nthe second question presented, and rests entirely on \nits mistaken premise that the Wisconsin Supreme \n\n12 \n \nCourt did not address the beyond-a-reasonable-doubt \nstandard. BIO.25. But as noted above, the lower court \nmade a point of invoking the standard and repeating \nit at every turn of the decision. And Wisconsin says \nnothing at all about the fact that this Court has al-\nready twice found the first question presented cert-\nworthy. Pet.7-8 (discussing St. Martin and Grace \nBrethren).  \nCONCLUSION \nThe petition should be granted. \nRespectfully submitted. \n \n \nERIC C. RASSBACH \n   Counsel of Record \nNICHOLAS R.

After repeatedly telling the state courts that \nCatholic Charities\u2019 service to the poor, the hungry, the \nelderly, and the disabled was \u201cpurely secular,\u201d Wiscon-\nsin now avoids the argument entirely. And after liti-\ngating this as a tax exemption case for the last eight \nyears, suddenly Wisconsin declares that Catholic \nCharities isn\u2019t paying a tax at all. \nIn place of its old arguments, Wisconsin offers en-\ntirely new ones. For the first time in any court, it ques-\ntions Catholic Charities\u2019 understanding of how the \nCatholic doctrine of subsidiarity applies to the govern-\nance of the Diocese of Superior. For the first time, it \nasserts that Catholic Charities is suffering no burden \nat all from Wisconsin\u2019s discriminatory treatment. And \nfor the first time, it says its discrimination against \nCatholic Charities is excused by a tu quoque analogy \nto the ministerial exception\u2014in Wisconsin\u2019s telling, \nthis Court second-guesses religious beliefs, so it can \ntoo.  \nThe brand-new arguments aren\u2019t any better than \nthe old ones. Wisconsin still seeks to sever the chari-\ntable arm of the Diocese of Superior from the broader \nreligious body that is the Catholic Church. It still \nseeks to second-guess Catholic Charities\u2019 religious an-\nswers to religious questions (something this Court has \nnot done). And it is still trying to give a preference to \nreligious groups that serve only members of their own \n\n2 \n \nchurch or that proselytize when providing social assis-\ntance. This Court should discard Wisconsin\u2019s new ar-\nguments just as Wisconsin has discarded its old ones. \nNo creative legal theorizing can justify the Wisconsin \nSupreme Court\u2019s multiple violations of the Religion \nClauses. \nWisconsin also reimagines the facts. It seeks\u2014for \nthe first time in this Court\u2014to contest whether Cath-\nolic Charities has suffered any burden at all, even \nthough Catholic Charities is being treated unequally. \nAnd it claims that Catholic Charities is just providing \n\u201coversight services\u201d to the various ministries it directs, \nwhen Catholic Charities both directs the sub-entities\u2019 \nministry and engages in direct ministry to those in \nneed.  \nHappily, Wisconsin\u2019s new facts are beside the \npoint. Wisconsin\u2019s errors are plain on the face of the \nopinion below. The Wisconsin Supreme Court adopted \ncategories of selection and methods of decision that no \ncivil court ought, so its decision cannot stand. \nA. Wisconsin\u2019s rule violates the church au-\ntonomy doctrine. \nThis Court has long recognized that church auton-\nomy protects religious groups\u2019 ecclesiastical decisions \nabout how they structure their polity. Pet.Br.25-29. \nHere, the Diocese and Catholic Charities have made \nreligious decisions, rooted in the Catholic Church\u2019s \nteachings on charity and church governance, about \nhow to structure their ministry to the needy across \n15,000 square miles of rural northern Wisconsin. \nPet.Br.6-7; Pet.App.373a (\u201c[O]ur organization should \nbe directed and guided by those people closest to the \n\n3 \n \nfamilies in need[.]\u201d). But Wisconsin penalizes those re-\nligious decisions by denying Catholic Charities a tax \nexemption based on its religiously motivated church \nstructure, thus severing one part of the body ecclesias-\ntic from the rest of the Church. That violates the \nchurch autonomy doctrine.1 \nWisconsin offers several scattershot arguments in \nresponse. None has merit. \n1. First, Wisconsin attempts to limit the doctrine\u2019s \nscope. It argues that \u201cnarrow church autonomy princi-\nples\u201d \u201cprotect[ ] only decisions affecting faith and doc-\ntrine.\u201d Resp.Br.13, 49. Church polity, in Wisconsin\u2019s \nview, is not such an area. Resp.Br.53. \nThis argument contradicts decades of precedent. In \nKedroff, this Court made clear that the Religion \nClauses protect not just matters \u201cof faith and doc-\ntrine,\u201d but also \u201cmatters of church government.\u201d \nKedroff v. Saint Nicholas Cathedral of Russian Ortho-\ndox Church in N. Am., 344 U.S. 94, 116 (1952). Like-\nwise, in Milivojevich, this Court described the \u201creor-\nganization of the Diocese\u201d as \u201can issue at the core of \necclesiastical affairs\u201d and held that allowing civil \ncourts to overrule it \u201cwould violate the First Amend-\nment in much the same manner as civil determination \nof religious doctrine.\u201d Serbian E. Orthodox Diocese for \nU.S. of Am. & Can. v. Milivojevich, 426 U.S. 696, 708-\n709, 721 (1976). And in Hosanna-Tabor, this Court \nsaid that the First Amendment both \u201c\u2018permit[s] hier-\narchical religious organizations to establish their own \n \n1  \nOddly, Wisconsin calls church autonomy an \u201caccommoda-\ntion,\u201d Resp.Br.2, as well as an \u201cexemption\u201d that this Court \u201cfash-\nion[ed],\u201d Resp.Br.17. \n\n4 \n \nrules and regulations for internal discipline and gov-\nernment,\u2019\u201d and prevents \u201cinterfere[nce] with the inter-\nnal governance of the church.\u201d Hosanna-Tabor Evan-\ngelical Lutheran Church & Sch. v. EEOC, 565 U.S. \n171, 187-188 (2012). Church polity is therefore at the \nheart of what the church autonomy doctrine protects. \nIn the same vein, Wisconsin says church autonomy \nbecomes relevant only when \u201cthe state controls a \nchurch\u2019s decision\u201d\u2014i.e., when the state acts \u201cwith le-\ngally binding effect to override a church decision.\u201d \nResp.Br.48. But this Court has long recognized that \nchurch autonomy guarantees can be triggered by \u201csec-\nular control or manipulation.\u201d Kedroff, 344 U.S. at 116 \n(emphasis added). Far from \u201cnarrowly shield[ing]\u201d re-\nligious bodies, the \u201cbroad principle\u201d of church auton-\nomy protects against government attempts \u201ceven to in-\nfluence\u201d \nchurch \ngovernance \nmatters. \nCompare \nResp.Br.47 with Our Lady of Guadalupe Sch. v. Mor-\nrissey-Berru, 591 U.S. 732, 746-747 (2020). See also \nHosanna-Tabor, 565 U.S. at 194 (requested relief \nwould \u201coperate as a penalty on the Church\u201d); Carson \nv. Makin, 596 U.S. 767, 778 (2022) (\u201c[T]he First \nAmendment protects against \u2018indirect coercion or pen-\nalties on the free exercise of religion, not just outright \nprohibitions.\u2019\u201d); Larson v. Valente, 456 U.S. 228, 234, \n246 (1982) (Establishment Clause violated where Min-\nnesota statutory exemption placed higher administra-\ntive burdens on some religious groups). \n2. Unable to narrow the church autonomy doctrine, \nWisconsin next claims that there is no burden on Cath-\nolic Charities, so Catholic Charities cannot raise a \nchurch autonomy claim (or any other claim under the \nReligion Clauses). Resp.Br.34, 38-40, 44. But Catholic \n\n5 \n \nCharities suffers three burdens\u2014it is unable to partic-\nipate in the Catholic bishops\u2019 own unemployment ben-\nefits program, it suffers unequal treatment because of \nits religion, and it suffers economic burdens. \nAs Catholic Charities explained in its opening \nbrief, it seeks to join the Diocese of Superior, its sub-\nentity Challenge Center, and most other Wisconsin \nCatholic diocesan entities in the Catholic Unemploy-\nment Pay Program (CUPP). Pet.Br.11-13. Wisconsin\u2019s \nrefusal to allow it the religious-purposes exemption \nmeans that Catholic Charities is unable to join the pro-\ngram. That in turn means it is unable to meet its \u201cso-\ncial justice responsibilities by providing church funded \nunemployment coverage\u201d and show solidarity both \nwith its workers and with the rest of the Church in \nWisconsin. Pet.App.433a. That alone is a burden, and \nWisconsin has nothing to say to this point. \nCatholic Charities also suffers the burden of dis-\ncrimination. The Religion Clauses protect \u201c\u2018religious \nobservers against unequal treatment\u2019 and against \nlaws that impose special disabilities on the basis of re-\nligious status.\u201d Espinoza v. Montana Dep\u2019t of Revenue, \n591 U.S. 464, 475 (2020). In Trinity Lutheran, for ex-\nample, the Court rejected a similar argument that \nthere was no \u201cmeaningful[ ] burden,\u201d holding that \u201cthe \nFree Exercise Clause protects against \u2018indirect coer-\ncion or penalties on the free exercise of religion, not \njust outright prohibitions.\u2019\u201d Trinity Lutheran Church \nof Columbia, Inc. v. Comer, 582 U.S. 449, 462-463 \n(2017); see also Morris Cnty. Bd. of Chosen Freeholders \nv. Freedom From Religion Found., 586 U.S. 1213, 1215 \n(2019) (statement of Kavanaugh, J.) (discussing \u201cprin-\nciple of religious equality\u201d); Pet.Br.23-24. In brief, \n\u201cgovernment may not treat religious persons, religious \n\n6 \n \norganizations, or religious speech as second-class.\u201d \nShurtleff v. City of Boston, 596 U.S. 243, 261 (2022) \n(Kavanaugh, J., concurring). \nIn light of all this, Wisconsin concedes that the de-\nnial of a benefit on account of one\u2019s religious belief or \npractice sometimes constitutes a cognizable burden. \nResp.Br.39 (discussing Sherbert and Lukumi). But \nWisconsin also says there is no burden here because \nCatholic Charities doesn\u2019t say that paying the tax \n\u201cwould violate their religious faith.\u201d Resp.Br.40. That \nwrongly assumes that burdens exist only when gov-\nernment requires a believer to do something that is re-\nligiously forbidden. But burdens also exist where gov-\nernment penalizes a believer for undertaking religious \nbehavior. See, e.g., Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. \nv. City of Hialeah, 508 U.S. 520, 543 (1993) (penalty \nfor engaging in ritual sacrifice). That is true even \nwhen the religious exercise is part of the faith but not \nrequired by the faith. See, e.g., Espinoza, 591 U.S. at \n475-476 (participation in tuition assistance program).  \nWisconsin attempts to distinguish these cases by \narguing that the religious-purposes exemption is not a \n\u201cgenerally available\u201d benefit. Resp.Br.40. But a benefit \nneed not be available to everyone to be considered \n\u201cgenerally available.\u201d E.g., Trinity Lutheran, 582 U.S. \nat 455 (grants \u201caward[ed]  * * *  on a competitive basis \nto those scoring highest based on several criteria\u201d). In-\nstead, generally available means it would be available \nbut for the religious belief or exercise at issue. See Car-\nson, 596 U.S. at 773 (benefit available only in certain \nschool districts).  \nCatholic Charities also suffers economic burdens. \nPet.Br.12. But Wisconsin now asserts that Catholic \nCharities suffers no economic burdens, going so far as \n\n7 \n \nto claim that \u201cPetitioners do not pay a tax.\u201d \nResp.Br.52.  \nThis is sophistry. In fact, Wisconsin said through-\nout the lower court litigation that Catholic Charities \nwas seeking a \u201ctax exemption.\u201d Resp.Wis.C.A.Br.35; \nResp.Wis.S.Ct.Br.32 (\u201cdenial of the unemployment tax \nexemption to the employers does not violate the U.S. \nor Wisconsin Constitutions\u201d). The very first sentence \nof the Wisconsin Supreme Court\u2019s decision below \nstated that Petitioners \u201cseek an exemption from hav-\ning to pay unemployment tax to cover their employ-\nees.\u201d Pet.App.4a. Indeed, Chapter 108 was \u201cwas en-\nacted to conform\u201d to the Federal Unemployment Tax \nAct. Pet.App.31a.2 \nWisconsin was right the first time. That Catholic \nCharities uses \u201creimbursement financing\u201d to pay the \nunemployment tax rather than \u201ccontribution financ-\ning\u201d is irrelevant. Resp.Br.52.3 These are just two dif-\nferent methods of paying the tax.4 The primary differ-\nence is that contributions are paid on a quarterly basis \n \n2  \nPerhaps out of inadvertence, Wisconsin elsewhere character-\nizes the payments as a tax. Resp.Br.39 (\u201cpaying a tax\u201d). \n3  \nBefore filing its brief in this Court, Wisconsin never raised \nany argument that the difference between contribution financing \nand reimbursement financing affected the analysis in this case. \nBecause this argument was not raised below, it is waived. Spri-\netsma v. Mercury Marine, 537 U.S. 51, 56 n.4 (2002).  \n4  \nSee Wis. Stat. \u00a7 108.151(2) (describing \u201creimbursement fi-\nnancing\u201d for nonprofit employers); Wis. Stat. \u00a7 108.15(3) (con-\ntrasting \u201ccontribution financing\u201d with reimbursement financing \n \n \n \n\n8 \n \nin advance, while reimbursements are paid once a for-\nmer employee seeks unemployment benefits, i.e., once \nthere is a taxable event. With both, the state unem-\nployment fund keeps an account in place for the em-\nployer and monitors how much money is in the ac-\ncount. If a contribution financing employer\u2019s account \nruns too low, its tax rates go up.5 Similarly, if a reim-\nbursement financing employer\u2019s account runs too low, \nWisconsin sends it a bill.6 And under either method, \nemployers must pay into the unemployment fund to \ncover their former employees\u2019 benefits as they are dis-\nbursed. As a result, Catholic Charities has paid the tax \nwhen former employees have sought benefits from the \nState. \nMoreover, Catholic Charities expends significant \nadditional resources to comply with the State\u2019s sys-\ntem. Pet.Br.11-12; see also Wis.Catholic.Conf.Br.9-11 \n(discussing CUPP and State systems). Every dollar \nand staff-hour devoted to administering the State\u2019s \nprogram can no longer be used for Catholic Charities\u2019 \n \nfor government units). Contribution financing is the default for \nprivate employers, while reimbursement financing is available to \ngovernmental units, nonprofit organizations, and Indian tribes. \nWis. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 108.15, 108.151, 108.152. Reimbursement financing \nemployers must deposit an \u201cassurance of reimbursement,\u201d such \nas a bond, with the State. Wis. Stat. \u00a7 108.151(4). \n5  \nSee Unemployment Insurance 2025 Tax Rates, Department of \nWorkforce Development, https://dwd.wisconsin.gov/ui/employ-\ners/taxrates.htm. \n6  \nWis. Stat. \u00a7 108.151(5)(f). \n\n9 \n \nmission of serving those in need.7 That is why, contra \nResp.Br.51, Catholic Charities first sought an exemp-\ntion almost 25 years ago through its sub-entity Chal-\nlenge Center. Pet.App.498a. And, once Challenge Cen-\nter was exempt, Catholic Charities spent most of the \npast two decades trying to obtain equal treatment for \nits other ministries\u2014to remove the significant eco-\nnomic and administrative burdens of the tax. \nPet.App.450a (Dec. 2003 attempt to withdraw); \nPet.App.456a-460a (2005 decision denying exemp-\ntion). \n3. Wisconsin offers a few additional arguments \nagainst the application of church autonomy. It argues \nthat because a secular entity can elect to incorporate \nseparately, all such organizational decisions can\u2019t be \nreligious. Resp.Br.53. That tracks the Wisconsin Su-\npreme Court\u2019s view that what is not exclusively reli-\ngious must be secular. Pet.App.30a. But adopting that \nview with respect to church organization would re-\nquire this Court to ignore the fact that church polity \nis, for many faiths, deeply doctrinal. See Eleven De-\nnominations Br.15-19 (discussing the different polities \nreligious groups use to further their charitable be-\nliefs). \nNext, Wisconsin questions\u2014for the first time in \neight years of litigation\u2014Catholic Charities\u2019 interpre-\ntation of what the Catholic Church teaches regarding \n \n7  \nWisconsin asserts that \u201cCatholic Charities itself does not pro-\nvide direct services to individuals\u201d and instead provides only \noversight. Resp.Br.8. Not so. Catholic Charities itself provides a \nnumber of services directly to the needy. For example, Catholic \nCharities runs an extensive housing program for income-eligible \nseniors and those with specific disabilities. See JA.211-213; CCB \nHousing Management, www.ccbhousing.org. \n\n10 \n \nsubsidiarity. Resp.Br.53. Aside from the fact that such \nan argument is waived and unsupported by the testi-\nmony below, JA.200, JA.208, Pet.App.373a, permit-\nting such second-guessing would violate the Religion \nClauses\u2019 bedrock rule against civil courts deciding re-\nligious questions. See, e.g., Presbyterian Church in \nU.S. v. Mary Elizabeth Blue Hull Mem\u2019l Presbyterian \nChurch, 393 U.S. 440, 445-446 (1969) (adjudicating \n\u201ccontroversy over church doctrine\u201d was \u201cwholly incon-\nsistent with the American concept of the relationship \nbetween church and state\u201d). \n4. Finally, Wisconsin parades horribles, claiming \nthat relying on church autonomy would put religious \nexemptions in danger. Resp.Br.45-47. The argument \nproves too much. Of course legislators (and judges) \nhave to draw lines. See Pet.Br.31-33 (discussing the \nnecessity of distinguishing among different kinds of \nreligious groups). But the task is hardly impossible. \nMany other states have applied the \u201coperated primar-\nily for religious purposes\u201d language for decades with-\nout need of Wisconsin\u2019s aberrant test for inherently (or \n\u201cdistinctively\u201d) religious activities, and without any \napparent constitutional problems. See, e.g., Kendall v. \nDirector of Div. of Emp. Sec., 473 N.E.2d 196, 198 \n(Mass. 1985). \nThe same is true of other religious exemptions. For \nexample, ERISA\u2019s church plan exemption applies to \nplans established and maintained \u201cby a church or by a \nconvention or association of churches.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \n1003(b)(2); 29 U.S.C. 1002(33). The unanimous Court \nhad no trouble construing and applying that religious \nexemption to determine which entities qualified for \nthe exemption in a case that concerned billions of dol-\nlars in pension plan obligations. See Advocate Health \n\n11 \n \nCare Network v. Stapleton, 581 U.S. 468, 482 (2017). \nThe Court cautioned, however, that it mattered how \ngovernment actors applied the exemption. Thus re-\nquiring the IRS to decide \u201cwhether a particular Cath-\nolic religious order should count as\u201d a \u201cchurch\u201d for pur-\nposes of the church plan exemption would \u201cby defini-\ntion, disfavor[] plans created by church affiliates, as \ncompared to those established by (whatever the IRS \nhas decided are) churches.\u201d Ibid. Other statutes oper-\nate\u2014without constitutional problem\u2014to create ex-\nemptions on a rolling basis. Thus the Religious Free-\ndom Restoration Act, 42 U.S.C. 2000bb et seq., and its \ncompanion the Religious Land Use and Institutional-\nized Persons Act, 42 U.S.C. 2000cc et seq., \u201coperate[ ] \nby mandating consideration  * * *  of exceptions.\u201d Gon-\nzales v. O Centro Esp\u00edrita Beneficente Uni\u00e3o do Vege-\ntal, 546 U.S. 418, 421 (2006). Establishment Clause \nchallenges to these statutes have all failed. See id. at \n436 (discussing the \u201cfeasibility of case-by-case consid-\neration of religious exemptions\u201d and Cutter v. Wil-\nkinson, 544 U.S. 709, 722-723 (2005)).  \nWisconsin is therefore free to enact an unemploy-\nment tax exemption for organizations \u201coperated pri-\nmarily for religious purposes\u201d in tandem with a sepa-\nrate exemption for churches, just as many other states \ndo. Wis. Stat. \u00a7 108.02(15)(h); Pet.Br.6 n.1; St. Martin \nEvangelical Lutheran Church v. South Dakota, 451 \nU.S. 772, 782 n.12 (1981). But it cannot then interpret \nthe exemption to privilege only those religious activi-\nties the state deems \u201cdistinctively religious,\u201d forcing \n\n12 \n \notherwise-exempt entities to reconsider their doctrine \nand polity.8 \nB. Wisconsin\u2019s rule entangles church and \nstate. \nThis Court has long held that \u201cit is no business of \ncourts to say that what is a religious practice or activ-\nity for one group is not religion under the protection of \nthe First Amendment.\u201d Fowler v. Rhode Island, 345 \nU.S. 67, 70 (1953). But that is precisely what Wiscon-\nsin is doing here. Catholic Charities sincerely believes \nthat showing Christ\u2019s love to the disabled, elderly, \nhungry, and poor is a \u201creligious\u201d activity. Yet Wiscon-\nsin has disregarded Catholic Charities\u2019 answer to this \n \n8  \nThe United States suggests that the Court could resolve this \nappeal by deciding questions of state law rather than the federal \nconstitutional question presented, invoking Michigan v. Long, \n463 U.S. 1032, 1040-1041 (1983), and the doctrine of constitu-\ntional avoidance. U.S.Br.13, 27. It is not apparent that this ma-\nneuver would result in any constitutional avoidance, since it im-\nmediately raises questions of this Court\u2019s jurisdiction, not least \nbecause the United States asks the Court to extend the rationale \nof Michigan v. Long well beyond the context of \u201cindependent and \nadequate state ground\u201d jurisprudence. Indeed, the United States\u2019 \ntheory seems to repurpose Michigan v. Long as a method of \nproviding post-hoc (and unbriefed) saving constructions of state \nlaws that have been challenged on federal constitutional grounds. \nThat makes little sense when the rationale of Michigan v. Long \nis to obviate \u201cthe need to examine state law.\u201d Michigan v. Long, \n463 U.S. at 1041. The maneuver seems particularly inapposite \nwhen the United States treats the religious-purposes exemption \nas entirely optional for states. Ibid. (\u201cwe will accept as the most \nreasonable explanation that the state court decided the case the \nway it did because it believed that federal law required it to do \nso\u201d) (emphasis added). Catholic Charities cannot object to obtain-\ning relief, but the United States\u2019 suggestion would leave Catholic \nCharities with lesser, and less durable, relief than it would obtain \nif the Court answered the question presented. \n\n13 \n \nreligious question and has decided instead that its \u201cac-\ntivities \n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

The Wisconsin \nSupreme Court deepened an existing split among \nlower courts over whether government violates the \nFirst Amendment when it decides that an admittedly \nreligious charity is not religious enough to merit equal \ntreatment under state FUTA-compliant tax exemption \nstatutes. And the Wisconsin Supreme Court also ex-\ntended a separate split over whether federal constitu-\ntional claims must be proven beyond a reasonable \ndoubt. Both questions are of nationwide importance, \nand this case gives the Court the perfect vehicle to ad-\ndress them.  \nThis Court should therefore intervene to vindicate \nthe First Amendment. Wisconsin should not be al-\nlowed to deny Catholic Charities and religious organi-\nzations like it an exemption just because\u2014as required \nby their faith\u2014they serve all people.  \nARGUMENT \nI. Only this Court can resolve the split over the \nFirst Amendment\u2019s application to FUTA-\ncompliant tax exemption statutes. \nState supreme courts are split 4-4 over whether \nthey can, consonant with the First Amendment, deny \na religious organization a religious tax exemption be-\ncause the organization does not engage in \u201ctypical\u201d re-\nligious activities\u2014like worship or proselytizing. \nPet.15-23. Respondents don\u2019t dispute that the Wiscon-\nsin Supreme Court recharacterized Petitioners\u2019 reli-\ngious exercise as primarily secular activity. Instead, \nthey try to minimize the split by pointing to irrelevant \nfacts and quibbling over the merits. Neither gambit \n\n2 \n \ndetracts from the need for this Court to resolve this \nimportant question of constitutional law. \nA. Courts are hopelessly split over whether \nreligious organizations can be denied a \nreligious tax exemption because their \nbehavior is not \u201ctypical\u201d enough to qualify. \n1. Respondents first say there is no split because \nsome state supreme courts didn\u2019t directly address \n\u201cFirst Amendment issues.\u201d BIO.8. Instead, Respond-\nents claim, these courts were merely interpreting \nFUTA-compliant state laws. Ibid. \nRespondents are wrong. As Petitioners explained, \nseveral cases in the split engaged in constitutional \nanalysis or (for the courts that came out the right way) \nsimply didn\u2019t need to reach any constitutional ques-\ntions. Pet.18, 20, 21, 23. And, more importantly, a \nstate court need not analyze the Constitution for its \ninterpretation of state law to violate the Constitution. \nIf Respondents were right, the simplest way for a court \nto certiorari-proof its opinion would be to ignore the \nConstitution altogether. That\u2019s obviously wrong. This \nCourt has \u201can obligation to ensure that state court in-\nterpretations of [state] law do not evade federal law.\u201d \nMoore v. Harper, 600 U.S. 1, 34 (2023). And here, there \nis no question that the decisions on the wrong side of \nthe split are not consistent with the demands of the \nFirst Amendment. Pet.23-30. \n2. Respondents next suggest that all courts in the \nsplit are applying the same standard. BIO.12. That \nblinks reality: The split has been acknowledged re-\npeatedly\u2014including in Terwilliger, Mid Vermont \nChristian School, and again in the decision below. \n\n3 \n \nPet.19 n.4. (Mid Vermont); Pet.21 (Terwilliger); \nApp.142a (this case). \nLooking for keys under the streetlight, Respond-\nents scour the opinions on the correct side of the split \nfor evidence of any religious activity, on the theory \nthat\u2014rather than looking at religious motivation or \nmission\u2014these courts instead balanced religious ac-\ntivities against secular activities and determined that \nthe religious activities predominated. BIO.13. But \nthat\u2019s not what they did, and Defendants\u2019 scattershot \nfactual citations tell us nothing about the legal stand-\nard these courts applied. \nIdaho. Respondents suggest that Champion Bake-\nN-Serve independently considered the bakery\u2019s activi-\nties because its analysis distinguished between full-\ntime employees and students receiving \u201creligious \ntraining\u201d through their work at the bakery. BIO.12-13. \nNot so\u2014the court concluded that the bakery\u2019s motiva-\ntion for employing students was primarily religious \n(because it viewed their work as religiously moti-\nvated). Department of Emp. v. Champion Bake-N-\nServe, Inc., 592 P.2d 1370, 1371-1372 (1979). That\u2019s \nfully consistent with the separate conclusion that the \nbakery might have had a different motivation for em-\nploying other employees. Ibid. And, contra BIO.13, \nNampa Christian similarly supports Petitioners. \nThere, the court looked to the school\u2019s \u201cintent and op-\nerations\u201d merely as evidence \u201creveal[ing]\u201d its \u201creligious \nmission and purpose.\u201d Nampa Christian Schs. Found., \nInc. v. State, 719 P.2d 1178, 1183 (Idaho 1986) (em-\nphasis added).  \nIowa. Respondents note that the religious school \nin Community Lutheran included religion in its curric-\nulum and required its teachers to be Lutheran. \n\n4 \n \nBIO.13. This tells us nothing about the legal standard \nthe court applied. And even a cursory review of the \nopinion shows that the court applied the correct stand-\nard\u2014expressly citing Champion Bake-N-Serve. See \nCommunity Lutheran Sch. v. Iowa Dep\u2019t of Job Serv., \n326 N.W.2d 286, 291 (Iowa 1982). \nMaine. The facts identified by Respondents in \nSchwartz v. Unemployment Insurance Commission \nsimilarly served as evidence of the organization\u2019s reli-\ngious motivations\u2014not as part of a supposed secular-\nversus-religious-activities balancing test. Indeed, af-\nter citing Kendall, the court explained that the Cen-\nter\u2019s outwardly secular activities (like its after-school \nprogram) did not at all \u201cdiminish its continuing reli-\ngious purpose.\u201d 895 A.2d 965, 970-971 (Me. 2006). \nMassachusetts. Even odder, Respondents claim \nKendall \u201cdid not rely on religious motivations alone.\u201d \nBIO.13. But, citing Champion Bake-N-Serve, the court \ntreated religious \u201cmotive\u201d and religious \u201cpurpose\u201d as \ntwo variations on the same idea. Kendall v. Director of \nDiv. of Emp. Sec., 473 N.E.2d 196, 199 (Mass. 1985). \nHere too, the facts Respondents flag, BIO.13, did not \nindependently drive the analysis; they supported the \nconclusion that the Center\u2019s ministry was religiously \nmotivated. Kendall, 473 N.E.2d at 199.  \nIn short, the fact that the religiously motivated en-\ntities in these cases unsurprisingly engaged in some \n\n5 \n \nreligious activities Wisconsin deems sufficiently \u201ctypi-\ncal\u201d tells us nothing about the legal standard the \ncourts applied.1 \n3. Finally, respondents suggest that their approach \nis \u201cconsistent\u201d with FUTA\u2019s legislative history. \nBIO.14. But, as an initial matter, this Court isn\u2019t being \nasked to interpret congressional intent at all. Instead, \nthis Court has been presented with a decision defini-\ntively interpreting Wisconsin law. The question is \nwhether that interpretation complies with the First \nAmendment. Because Congress lacks the authority to \neither definitively interpret Wisconsin law or the First \nAmendment, Congress\u2019 intent is beside the point. And, \nregardless, this Court in St. Martin (a case Respond-\nents all but ignore), considered the same legislative \nhistory cited by Respondents and gave it minimal \nweight. See St. Martin Evangelical Lutheran Church \nv. South Dakota, 451 U.S. 772, 782, 786-788 (1981); \nsee id. at 790-791 (Stevens, J., concurring) (\u201cthere is \nspecial force to the rule that the plain statutory lan-\nguage should control\u201d). \nB. The decision below violates the First \nAmendment. \nThe approach taken by the Wisconsin Supreme \nCourt and defended by Respondents violates the First \nAmendment thrice over. Pet.23-31. Respondents claim \ntheir position is consistent with the Constitution. \nBIO.15-19. A fuller response can be saved for the mer-\nits, but Petitioners offer a few points here. \n \n1  \nRespondents\u2019 attempts to distinguish the intermediate appel-\nlate court opinions fail for the same reason. Compare Pet.19-20 \nwith BIO.13-14.  \n\n6 \n \nFirst, Respondents never dispute, and thus con-\ncede, that their test favors some religious beliefs over \nothers. Pet.23-26. Instead, Respondents excuse the un-\nequal treatment by arguing that the law doesn\u2019t bur-\nden Petitioners. BIO.17-19. But Respondents\u2019 argu-\nment is as outdated as their precedent. Unequal denial \nof a benefit is a textbook burden on Free Exercise \nrights. E.g., Trinity Lutheran Church of Columbia, \nInc. v. Comer, 582 U.S. 449, 463 (2017). And here there \nis a burden because Wisconsin is denying Petitioners \nan exemption. \nSecond, Respondents claim there is no excessive \nentanglement because Wisconsin \u201caccepted\u201d Petition-\ners\u2019 beliefs and only \u201crelied on [Catholic Charities\u2019] \n\u2018primarily charitable and secular\u2019 activities\u201d to per-\nform its analysis. BIO.16. But that begs the question. \nDetermining whether various activities\u2014like feeding \nthe hungry\u2014are inherently secular or religious is the \nexcessive entanglement. Pet.27-29.  \nThird, Respondents argue that this case is \u201cnothing \nlike\u201d Kedroff because it does not involve matters which \n\u201cbelong to the church alone.\u201d BIO.17. But the principle \nof church autonomy articulated in Kedroff ensures \nthat secular authorities don\u2019t interfere with matters of \nchurch governance and organization. Pet.29-30. Here, \nRespondents never dispute that Wisconsin\u2019s rule fa-\nvors certain types of church structures over others\u2014or \nthat only exclusively religious activity counts. Ibid. \nII. Lower courts are split over whether federal \nconstitutional \nclaims \nmust \nbe \nproven \n\u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d \nOver a strong dissent, the Wisconsin Supreme \nCourt emphasized\u2014seven times\u2014that it was applying \n\n7 \n \na \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d standard. App.7a, 37a, \n44a, 47a, 50a, 51a; see also 93a-94a (Grassl Bradley, \nJ., dissenting). That standard is both wrong and at \nodds with the approach taken by this Court and other \nfederal courts. These courts, if they apply a burden of \nproving unconstitutionality at all, employ a much \nlower \u201cplain showing\u201d or \u201cclearly demonstrated\u201d stand-\nard. Pet.31. \n1. Respondents agree that the Wisconsin Supreme \nCourt applied the \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d stand-\nard. BIO.24. Yet, as they do not dispute, this Court \nlong ago abandoned that standard. The most recent \nreference Respondents identify is over 100 years old. \nBIO.21 (citing Adkins v. Children\u2019s Hosp. of D.C., 261 \nU.S. 525, 544 (1923)). And the only other federal court \nthey cite picks up this standard from a state supreme \ncourt. BIO.22 (quoting Dutra v. Trustees of Bos. Univ., \n96 F.4th 15, 20 (1st Cir. 2024) (quoting Leibovich v. \nAntonellis, 574 N.E.2d 978, 984 (Mass. 1991))). \nRespondents thus concede that different courts \nhave adopted different formulations of the legal stand-\nard\u2014they just claim that this variation is unim-\nportant. BIO.20-21. But precision of language matters, \nespecially when it comes to standards of proof. A nar-\nrow win under one standard can become a loss under \na more stringent standard. E.g., Hilburn v. Enerpipe \nLtd., 442 P.3d 509, 527-528 (Kan. 2019) (Stegall, J., \nconcurring in part) (difference between de novo and \n\u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d standards outcome-deter-\nminative); Island County v. State, 955 P.2d 377, 388 \n(Wash. 1998) (Sanders, J., concurring) (similar discus-\nsion).  \nFurthermore, if Respondents\u2019 argument is that \u201cbe-\nyond a reasonable doubt\u201d doesn\u2019t really mean \u201cbeyond \n\n8 \n \na reasonable doubt,\u201d BIO.23-24 (standard is \u201cnot the \nhigh burden of proof it represents in the criminal-law \ncontext\u201d), that concession alone is reason to grant re-\nview. Two different standards of proof traveling under \nthe same name is a recipe for lower court confusion \nand inconsistent application of the civil rights laws.  \nNor does Respondents\u2019 argument make sense of \nthis case. Even if many states treat the standard as \n\u201chortatory,\u201d Wisconsin stands among the small group \nthat applies the \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d in a way \nthat is often dispositive of federal constitutional \nclaims. The Wisconsin Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in this \ncase serves as an exemplar. Pet.33-34. And, tellingly, \nRespondents do not engage with the opinion below or \neven cite the other Wisconsin cases applying the same \nstandard. Compare BIO.22, 24 with Pet.34. Like the \nmajority below, Respondents also do not substantively \nengage the dissenting opinion, which explained how \nthe majority \u201cstack[ed] the deck against Catholic \nCharities\u2019 claims under the Religion Clauses from the \noutset.\u201d App.93a. They instead cite Mayo, BIO.23, but \nfail to mention that the separate writing in Mayo iden-\ntifies this exact split. See Mayo v. Wisconsin Injured \nPatients & Families Comp. Fund, 914 N.W.2d 678, 700 \n(Wis. 2018) (Grassl Bradley, J., concurring). \n2. Respondents\u2019 fallback position is that this case is \nnot the right vehicle for this Court to consider the is-\nsue because Petitioners failed to raise a challenge to \nthe standard below. BIO.25. But before the Wisconsin \nSupreme Court used it, no other adjudicator through \nfive levels of review had mentioned\u2014much less ap-\nplied\u2014\u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d See BIO.24 (ac-\nknowledging that the Wisconsin Court of Appeals did \n\n9 \n \nnot use the \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d standard). Pe-\ntitioners are not charged with prescience about what \nerroneous standards a court might invoke; it suffices \nto mount a challenge to a wrongheaded standard at \nthe first opportunity.  \nRespondents also say that the opinion below pro-\nvides inadequate discussion for this Court to resolve \nthe issue. BIO.20. But the opinion below is utterly typ-\nical of how state courts misuse the \u201cbeyond a reasona-\nble doubt\u201d standard to minimize federal constitutional \nrights. And many jurists\u2014including the dissent \nhere\u2014have analyzed the issue in depth. See, e.g., \nApp.93a-94a; Mayo, 914 N.W.2d at 697-705 (Grassl \nBradley, J., concurring); State v. Grevious, 223 N.E.3d \n323, 343 (Ohio 2022) (DeWine, J., concurring in judg-\nment); Hilburn, 442 P.3d at 526-531 (Stegall, J., con-\ncurring in part); Island County, 955 P.2d at 384 (Sand-\ners, J., concurring). Where a split is already clear, this \nCourt does not require the challenged decision to dis-\ncuss it in treatise-level detail. \nIII. This case presents an excellent vehicle to \naddress \nthese \nquestions \nof \nnationwide \nimportance. \nBoth questions presented are of nationwide im-\nportance, and both can be squarely addressed in this \nappeal. \n1. The first question presented concerns an issue of \nnationwide importance, demonstrated not least by the \nfact that 47 states have identical or near-identical \nstatutory language. Pet.6 n.1. If the Wisconsin Su-\npreme Court\u2019s decision is allowed to stand, religious \norganizations of all stripes in Wisconsin will be di-\n\n10 \n \nrectly and negatively affected. And because the rele-\nvant statutory language is identical across so many ju-\nrisdictions, Wisconsin\u2019s rule promises to find traction \nin other states as well.  \nMoreover, because the religious entities affected of-\nten operate on shoestring budgets, adoption of the \nWisconsin rule will have an outsize effect on the abil-\nity of these organizations to continue serving the \nneedy. Indeed, as the many amici explain, minority re-\nligious groups, whose religious practices are often un-\nfamiliar to nonadherents, will face \u201cdisproportionate[ ] \ndisadvantage.\u201d ISKCON Br.4. See also Jewish Coali-\ntion Br.1-4, 6-15 (\u201cthe State\u2019s \u2018true religiosity\u2019 test sys-\ntematically harms minority religions like Judaism\u201d); \nLCMS Br.14-16 (describing effects of Wisconsin rule \non variety of religions). In short, the First Amendment \nis of vital importance and the lower court\u2019s interpreta-\ntion represents a grave threat to its application. \nMore broadly, whether government can properly \nclassify specific behaviors as objectively religious or \nnonreligious, as opposed to beliefs, is an important and \nrecurring one. See, e.g., Thomas v. Review Bd., 450 \nU.S. 707, 718-719 (1981) (discussing termination of \nemployment for \u201c\u2018personal\u2019 reasons\u201d or for \u201creligious \nreasons\u201d); cf. Wisconsin v. Yoder, 406 U.S. 205, 216 \n(1972) (\u2018Thoreau\u2019s choice was philosophical and per-\nsonal rather than religious, and such belief does not \nrise to the demands of the Religion Clauses.\u201d). Thus \ndrinking wine can be a religious act based not on some-\nthing inherent to the behavior, but on the web of belief \nthat surrounds the act. Drinking a cup of wine at a \nPassover seder has profound importance because of \nthe relevant context of belief; by contrast, drinking a \ncup of wine on an airplane flight would (normally) \n\n11 \n \nhave no religious significance. That broader and very \nimportant question is directly implicated by the Wis-\nconsin Supreme Court\u2019s rule. Indeed, \u201cWisconsin\u2019s test \nis a blueprint for undermining religious exemptions \nacross the board.\u201d Religious Scholars Br.15. \n2. The second question presented is also of nation-\nwide importance\u2014by virtue of the importance of the \nburden of proof in deciding constitutional claims. \nWhether a federal constitutional claim must be proven \nbeyond a reasonable doubt, by clear and convincing ev-\nidence, or some other standard is of utmost importance \nto the outcome of individual cases and entire areas of \njurisprudence. See, e.g., Heller v. Doe, 509 U.S. 312, \n325 \n(1993) \n(distinguishing \nclear-and-convincing \nstandard from beyond-a-reasonable-doubt standard in \nthe context of an Equal Protection challenge to mental \nillness commitment proceedings); Anderson v. Liberty \nLobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 252-253 (1986) (discussing \nimportance of following the proper standard of proof \non summary judgment). And there is also good reason \nto end the disjunct caused by having different stand-\nards for federal claims in federal and state courts, not \nleast to avoid incentives to forum-shop. Pet.35. This \ncase presents an opportunity to remove this anomaly \nin the law. \n3. This appeal is also an excellent vehicle for resolv-\ning both questions presented. It includes a robust rec-\nord that will allow the Court to fully review both ques-\ntions. And the Wisconsin Supreme Court directly ad-\ndressed both questions presented, so there are no ob-\nstacles to reaching and resolving both. \nWisconsin\u2019s only anti-vehicle argument concerns \nthe second question presented, and rests entirely on \nits mistaken premise that the Wisconsin Supreme \n\n12 \n \nCourt did not address the beyond-a-reasonable-doubt \nstandard. BIO.25. But as noted above, the lower court \nmade a point of invoking the standard and repeating \nit at every turn of the decision. And Wisconsin says \nnothing at all about the fact that this Court has al-\nready twice found the first question presented cert-\nworthy. Pet.7-8 (discussing St. Martin and Grace \nBrethren).  \nCONCLUSION \nThe petition should be granted. \nRespectfully submitted. \n \n \nERIC C. RASSBACH \n   Counsel of Record \nNICHOLAS R.

After repeatedly telling the state courts that \nCatholic Charities\u2019 service to the poor, the hungry, the \nelderly, and the disabled was \u201cpurely secular,\u201d Wiscon-\nsin now avoids the argument entirely. And after liti-\ngating this as a tax exemption case for the last eight \nyears, suddenly Wisconsin declares that Catholic \nCharities isn\u2019t paying a tax at all. \nIn place of its old arguments, Wisconsin offers en-\ntirely new ones. For the first time in any court, it ques-\ntions Catholic Charities\u2019 understanding of how the \nCatholic doctrine of subsidiarity applies to the govern-\nance of the Diocese of Superior. For the first time, it \nasserts that Catholic Charities is suffering no burden \nat all from Wisconsin\u2019s discriminatory treatment. And \nfor the first time, it says its discrimination against \nCatholic Charities is excused by a tu quoque analogy \nto the ministerial exception\u2014in Wisconsin\u2019s telling, \nthis Court second-guesses religious beliefs, so it can \ntoo.  \nThe brand-new arguments aren\u2019t any better than \nthe old ones. Wisconsin still seeks to sever the chari-\ntable arm of the Diocese of Superior from the broader \nreligious body that is the Catholic Church. It still \nseeks to second-guess Catholic Charities\u2019 religious an-\nswers to religious questions (something this Court has \nnot done). And it is still trying to give a preference to \nreligious groups that serve only members of their own \n\n2 \n \nchurch or that proselytize when providing social assis-\ntance. This Court should discard Wisconsin\u2019s new ar-\nguments just as Wisconsin has discarded its old ones. \nNo creative legal theorizing can justify the Wisconsin \nSupreme Court\u2019s multiple violations of the Religion \nClauses. \nWisconsin also reimagines the facts. It seeks\u2014for \nthe first time in this Court\u2014to contest whether Cath-\nolic Charities has suffered any burden at all, even \nthough Catholic Charities is being treated unequally. \nAnd it claims that Catholic Charities is just providing \n\u201coversight services\u201d to the various ministries it directs, \nwhen Catholic Charities both directs the sub-entities\u2019 \nministry and engages in direct ministry to those in \nneed.  \nHappily, Wisconsin\u2019s new facts are beside the \npoint. Wisconsin\u2019s errors are plain on the face of the \nopinion below. The Wisconsin Supreme Court adopted \ncategories of selection and methods of decision that no \ncivil court ought, so its decision cannot stand. \nA. Wisconsin\u2019s rule violates the church au-\ntonomy doctrine. \nThis Court has long recognized that church auton-\nomy protects religious groups\u2019 ecclesiastical decisions \nabout how they structure their polity. Pet.Br.25-29. \nHere, the Diocese and Catholic Charities have made \nreligious decisions, rooted in the Catholic Church\u2019s \nteachings on charity and church governance, about \nhow to structure their ministry to the needy across \n15,000 square miles of rural northern Wisconsin. \nPet.Br.6-7; Pet.App.373a (\u201c[O]ur organization should \nbe directed and guided by those people closest to the \n\n3 \n \nfamilies in need[.]\u201d). But Wisconsin penalizes those re-\nligious decisions by denying Catholic Charities a tax \nexemption based on its religiously motivated church \nstructure, thus severing one part of the body ecclesias-\ntic from the rest of the Church. That violates the \nchurch autonomy doctrine.1 \nWisconsin offers several scattershot arguments in \nresponse. None has merit. \n1. First, Wisconsin attempts to limit the doctrine\u2019s \nscope. It argues that \u201cnarrow church autonomy princi-\nples\u201d \u201cprotect[ ] only decisions affecting faith and doc-\ntrine.\u201d Resp.Br.13, 49. Church polity, in Wisconsin\u2019s \nview, is not such an area. Resp.Br.53. \nThis argument contradicts decades of precedent. In \nKedroff, this Court made clear that the Religion \nClauses protect not just matters \u201cof faith and doc-\ntrine,\u201d but also \u201cmatters of church government.\u201d \nKedroff v. Saint Nicholas Cathedral of Russian Ortho-\ndox Church in N. Am., 344 U.S. 94, 116 (1952). Like-\nwise, in Milivojevich, this Court described the \u201creor-\nganization of the Diocese\u201d as \u201can issue at the core of \necclesiastical affairs\u201d and held that allowing civil \ncourts to overrule it \u201cwould violate the First Amend-\nment in much the same manner as civil determination \nof religious doctrine.\u201d Serbian E. Orthodox Diocese for \nU.S. of Am. & Can. v. Milivojevich, 426 U.S. 696, 708-\n709, 721 (1976). And in Hosanna-Tabor, this Court \nsaid that the First Amendment both \u201c\u2018permit[s] hier-\narchical religious organizations to establish their own \n \n1  \nOddly, Wisconsin calls church autonomy an \u201caccommoda-\ntion,\u201d Resp.Br.2, as well as an \u201cexemption\u201d that this Court \u201cfash-\nion[ed],\u201d Resp.Br.17. \n\n4 \n \nrules and regulations for internal discipline and gov-\nernment,\u2019\u201d and prevents \u201cinterfere[nce] with the inter-\nnal governance of the church.\u201d Hosanna-Tabor Evan-\ngelical Lutheran Church & Sch. v. EEOC, 565 U.S. \n171, 187-188 (2012). Church polity is therefore at the \nheart of what the church autonomy doctrine protects. \nIn the same vein, Wisconsin says church autonomy \nbecomes relevant only when \u201cthe state controls a \nchurch\u2019s decision\u201d\u2014i.e., when the state acts \u201cwith le-\ngally binding effect to override a church decision.\u201d \nResp.Br.48. But this Court has long recognized that \nchurch autonomy guarantees can be triggered by \u201csec-\nular control or manipulation.\u201d Kedroff, 344 U.S. at 116 \n(emphasis added). Far from \u201cnarrowly shield[ing]\u201d re-\nligious bodies, the \u201cbroad principle\u201d of church auton-\nomy protects against government attempts \u201ceven to in-\nfluence\u201d \nchurch \ngovernance \nmatters. \nCompare \nResp.Br.47 with Our Lady of Guadalupe Sch. v. Mor-\nrissey-Berru, 591 U.S. 732, 746-747 (2020). See also \nHosanna-Tabor, 565 U.S. at 194 (requested relief \nwould \u201coperate as a penalty on the Church\u201d); Carson \nv. Makin, 596 U.S. 767, 778 (2022) (\u201c[T]he First \nAmendment protects against \u2018indirect coercion or pen-\nalties on the free exercise of religion, not just outright \nprohibitions.\u2019\u201d); Larson v. Valente, 456 U.S. 228, 234, \n246 (1982) (Establishment Clause violated where Min-\nnesota statutory exemption placed higher administra-\ntive burdens on some religious groups). \n2. Unable to narrow the church autonomy doctrine, \nWisconsin next claims that there is no burden on Cath-\nolic Charities, so Catholic Charities cannot raise a \nchurch autonomy claim (or any other claim under the \nReligion Clauses). Resp.Br.34, 38-40, 44. But Catholic \n\n5 \n \nCharities suffers three burdens\u2014it is unable to partic-\nipate in the Catholic bishops\u2019 own unemployment ben-\nefits program, it suffers unequal treatment because of \nits religion, and it suffers economic burdens. \nAs Catholic Charities explained in its opening \nbrief, it seeks to join the Diocese of Superior, its sub-\nentity Challenge Center, and most other Wisconsin \nCatholic diocesan entities in the Catholic Unemploy-\nment Pay Program (CUPP). Pet.Br.11-13. Wisconsin\u2019s \nrefusal to allow it the religious-purposes exemption \nmeans that Catholic Charities is unable to join the pro-\ngram. That in turn means it is unable to meet its \u201cso-\ncial justice responsibilities by providing church funded \nunemployment coverage\u201d and show solidarity both \nwith its workers and with the rest of the Church in \nWisconsin. Pet.App.433a. That alone is a burden, and \nWisconsin has nothing to say to this point. \nCatholic Charities also suffers the burden of dis-\ncrimination. The Religion Clauses protect \u201c\u2018religious \nobservers against unequal treatment\u2019 and against \nlaws that impose special disabilities on the basis of re-\nligious status.\u201d Espinoza v. Montana Dep\u2019t of Revenue, \n591 U.S. 464, 475 (2020). In Trinity Lutheran, for ex-\nample, the Court rejected a similar argument that \nthere was no \u201cmeaningful[ ] burden,\u201d holding that \u201cthe \nFree Exercise Clause protects against \u2018indirect coer-\ncion or penalties on the free exercise of religion, not \njust outright prohibitions.\u2019\u201d Trinity Lutheran Church \nof Columbia, Inc. v. Comer, 582 U.S. 449, 462-463 \n(2017); see also Morris Cnty. Bd. of Chosen Freeholders \nv. Freedom From Religion Found., 586 U.S. 1213, 1215 \n(2019) (statement of Kavanaugh, J.) (discussing \u201cprin-\nciple of religious equality\u201d); Pet.Br.23-24. In brief, \n\u201cgovernment may not treat religious persons, religious \n\n6 \n \norganizations, or religious speech as second-class.\u201d \nShurtleff v. City of Boston, 596 U.S. 243, 261 (2022) \n(Kavanaugh, J., concurring). \nIn light of all this, Wisconsin concedes that the de-\nnial of a benefit on account of one\u2019s religious belief or \npractice sometimes constitutes a cognizable burden. \nResp.Br.39 (discussing Sherbert and Lukumi). But \nWisconsin also says there is no burden here because \nCatholic Charities doesn\u2019t say that paying the tax \n\u201cwould violate their religious faith.\u201d Resp.Br.40. That \nwrongly assumes that burdens exist only when gov-\nernment requires a believer to do something that is re-\nligiously forbidden. But burdens also exist where gov-\nernment penalizes a believer for undertaking religious \nbehavior. See, e.g., Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. \nv. City of Hialeah, 508 U.S. 520, 543 (1993) (penalty \nfor engaging in ritual sacrifice). That is true even \nwhen the religious exercise is part of the faith but not \nrequired by the faith. See, e.g., Espinoza, 591 U.S. at \n475-476 (participation in tuition assistance program).  \nWisconsin attempts to distinguish these cases by \narguing that the religious-purposes exemption is not a \n\u201cgenerally available\u201d benefit. Resp.Br.40. But a benefit \nneed not be available to everyone to be considered \n\u201cgenerally available.\u201d E.g., Trinity Lutheran, 582 U.S. \nat 455 (grants \u201caward[ed]  * * *  on a competitive basis \nto those scoring highest based on several criteria\u201d). In-\nstead, generally available means it would be available \nbut for the religious belief or exercise at issue. See Car-\nson, 596 U.S. at 773 (benefit available only in certain \nschool districts).  \nCatholic Charities also suffers economic burdens. \nPet.Br.12. But Wisconsin now asserts that Catholic \nCharities suffers no economic burdens, going so far as \n\n7 \n \nto claim that \u201cPetitioners do not pay a tax.\u201d \nResp.Br.52.  \nThis is sophistry. In fact, Wisconsin said through-\nout the lower court litigation that Catholic Charities \nwas seeking a \u201ctax exemption.\u201d Resp.Wis.C.A.Br.35; \nResp.Wis.S.Ct.Br.32 (\u201cdenial of the unemployment tax \nexemption to the employers does not violate the U.S. \nor Wisconsin Constitutions\u201d). The very first sentence \nof the Wisconsin Supreme Court\u2019s decision below \nstated that Petitioners \u201cseek an exemption from hav-\ning to pay unemployment tax to cover their employ-\nees.\u201d Pet.App.4a. Indeed, Chapter 108 was \u201cwas en-\nacted to conform\u201d to the Federal Unemployment Tax \nAct. Pet.App.31a.2 \nWisconsin was right the first time. That Catholic \nCharities uses \u201creimbursement financing\u201d to pay the \nunemployment tax rather than \u201ccontribution financ-\ning\u201d is irrelevant. Resp.Br.52.3 These are just two dif-\nferent methods of paying the tax.4 The primary differ-\nence is that contributions are paid on a quarterly basis \n \n2  \nPerhaps out of inadvertence, Wisconsin elsewhere character-\nizes the payments as a tax. Resp.Br.39 (\u201cpaying a tax\u201d). \n3  \nBefore filing its brief in this Court, Wisconsin never raised \nany argument that the difference between contribution financing \nand reimbursement financing affected the analysis in this case. \nBecause this argument was not raised below, it is waived. Spri-\netsma v. Mercury Marine, 537 U.S. 51, 56 n.4 (2002).  \n4  \nSee Wis. Stat. \u00a7 108.151(2) (describing \u201creimbursement fi-\nnancing\u201d for nonprofit employers); Wis. Stat. \u00a7 108.15(3) (con-\ntrasting \u201ccontribution financing\u201d with reimbursement financing \n \n \n \n\n8 \n \nin advance, while reimbursements are paid once a for-\nmer employee seeks unemployment benefits, i.e., once \nthere is a taxable event. With both, the state unem-\nployment fund keeps an account in place for the em-\nployer and monitors how much money is in the ac-\ncount. If a contribution financing employer\u2019s account \nruns too low, its tax rates go up.5 Similarly, if a reim-\nbursement financing employer\u2019s account runs too low, \nWisconsin sends it a bill.6 And under either method, \nemployers must pay into the unemployment fund to \ncover their former employees\u2019 benefits as they are dis-\nbursed. As a result, Catholic Charities has paid the tax \nwhen former employees have sought benefits from the \nState. \nMoreover, Catholic Charities expends significant \nadditional resources to comply with the State\u2019s sys-\ntem. Pet.Br.11-12; see also Wis.Catholic.Conf.Br.9-11 \n(discussing CUPP and State systems). Every dollar \nand staff-hour devoted to administering the State\u2019s \nprogram can no longer be used for Catholic Charities\u2019 \n \nfor government units). Contribution financing is the default for \nprivate employers, while reimbursement financing is available to \ngovernmental units, nonprofit organizations, and Indian tribes. \nWis. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 108.15, 108.151, 108.152. Reimbursement financing \nemployers must deposit an \u201cassurance of reimbursement,\u201d such \nas a bond, with the State. Wis. Stat. \u00a7 108.151(4). \n5  \nSee Unemployment Insurance 2025 Tax Rates, Department of \nWorkforce Development, https://dwd.wisconsin.gov/ui/employ-\ners/taxrates.htm. \n6  \nWis. Stat. \u00a7 108.151(5)(f). \n\n9 \n \nmission of serving those in need.7 That is why, contra \nResp.Br.51, Catholic Charities first sought an exemp-\ntion almost 25 years ago through its sub-entity Chal-\nlenge Center. Pet.App.498a. And, once Challenge Cen-\nter was exempt, Catholic Charities spent most of the \npast two decades trying to obtain equal treatment for \nits other ministries\u2014to remove the significant eco-\nnomic and administrative burdens of the tax. \nPet.App.450a (Dec. 2003 attempt to withdraw); \nPet.App.456a-460a (2005 decision denying exemp-\ntion). \n3. Wisconsin offers a few additional arguments \nagainst the application of church autonomy. It argues \nthat because a secular entity can elect to incorporate \nseparately, all such organizational decisions can\u2019t be \nreligious. Resp.Br.53. That tracks the Wisconsin Su-\npreme Court\u2019s view that what is not exclusively reli-\ngious must be secular. Pet.App.30a. But adopting that \nview with respect to church organization would re-\nquire this Court to ignore the fact that church polity \nis, for many faiths, deeply doctrinal. See Eleven De-\nnominations Br.15-19 (discussing the different polities \nreligious groups use to further their charitable be-\nliefs). \nNext, Wisconsin questions\u2014for the first time in \neight years of litigation\u2014Catholic Charities\u2019 interpre-\ntation of what the Catholic Church teaches regarding \n \n7  \nWisconsin asserts that \u201cCatholic Charities itself does not pro-\nvide direct services to individuals\u201d and instead provides only \noversight. Resp.Br.8. Not so. Catholic Charities itself provides a \nnumber of services directly to the needy. For example, Catholic \nCharities runs an extensive housing program for income-eligible \nseniors and those with specific disabilities. See JA.211-213; CCB \nHousing Management, www.ccbhousing.org. \n\n10 \n \nsubsidiarity. Resp.Br.53. Aside from the fact that such \nan argument is waived and unsupported by the testi-\nmony below, JA.200, JA.208, Pet.App.373a, permit-\nting such second-guessing would violate the Religion \nClauses\u2019 bedrock rule against civil courts deciding re-\nligious questions. See, e.g., Presbyterian Church in \nU.S. v. Mary Elizabeth Blue Hull Mem\u2019l Presbyterian \nChurch, 393 U.S. 440, 445-446 (1969) (adjudicating \n\u201ccontroversy over church doctrine\u201d was \u201cwholly incon-\nsistent with the American concept of the relationship \nbetween church and state\u201d). \n4. Finally, Wisconsin parades horribles, claiming \nthat relying on church autonomy would put religious \nexemptions in danger. Resp.Br.45-47. The argument \nproves too much. Of course legislators (and judges) \nhave to draw lines. See Pet.Br.31-33 (discussing the \nnecessity of distinguishing among different kinds of \nreligious groups). But the task is hardly impossible. \nMany other states have applied the \u201coperated primar-\nily for religious purposes\u201d language for decades with-\nout need of Wisconsin\u2019s aberrant test for inherently (or \n\u201cdistinctively\u201d) religious activities, and without any \napparent constitutional problems. See, e.g., Kendall v. \nDirector of Div. of Emp. Sec., 473 N.E.2d 196, 198 \n(Mass. 1985). \nThe same is true of other religious exemptions. For \nexample, ERISA\u2019s church plan exemption applies to \nplans established and maintained \u201cby a church or by a \nconvention or association of churches.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \n1003(b)(2); 29 U.S.C. 1002(33). The unanimous Court \nhad no trouble construing and applying that religious \nexemption to determine which entities qualified for \nthe exemption in a case that concerned billions of dol-\nlars in pension plan obligations. See Advocate Health \n\n11 \n \nCare Network v. Stapleton, 581 U.S. 468, 482 (2017). \nThe Court cautioned, however, that it mattered how \ngovernment actors applied the exemption. Thus re-\nquiring the IRS to decide \u201cwhether a particular Cath-\nolic religious order should count as\u201d a \u201cchurch\u201d for pur-\nposes of the church plan exemption would \u201cby defini-\ntion, disfavor[] plans created by church affiliates, as \ncompared to those established by (whatever the IRS \nhas decided are) churches.\u201d Ibid. Other statutes oper-\nate\u2014without constitutional problem\u2014to create ex-\nemptions on a rolling basis. Thus the Religious Free-\ndom Restoration Act, 42 U.S.C. 2000bb et seq., and its \ncompanion the Religious Land Use and Institutional-\nized Persons Act, 42 U.S.C. 2000cc et seq., \u201coperate[ ] \nby mandating consideration  * * *  of exceptions.\u201d Gon-\nzales v. O Centro Esp\u00edrita Beneficente Uni\u00e3o do Vege-\ntal, 546 U.S. 418, 421 (2006). Establishment Clause \nchallenges to these statutes have all failed. See id. at \n436 (discussing the \u201cfeasibility of case-by-case consid-\neration of religious exemptions\u201d and Cutter v. Wil-\nkinson, 544 U.S. 709, 722-723 (2005)).  \nWisconsin is therefore free to enact an unemploy-\nment tax exemption for organizations \u201coperated pri-\nmarily for religious purposes\u201d in tandem with a sepa-\nrate exemption for churches, just as many other states \ndo. Wis. Stat. \u00a7 108.02(15)(h); Pet.Br.6 n.1; St. Martin \nEvangelical Lutheran Church v. South Dakota, 451 \nU.S. 772, 782 n.12 (1981). But it cannot then interpret \nthe exemption to privilege only those religious activi-\nties the state deems \u201cdistinctively religious,\u201d forcing \n\n12 \n \notherwise-exempt entities to reconsider their doctrine \nand polity.8 \nB. Wisconsin\u2019s rule entangles church and \nstate. \nThis Court has long held that \u201cit is no business of \ncourts to say that what is a religious practice or activ-\nity for one group is not religion under the protection of \nthe First Amendment.\u201d Fowler v. Rhode Island, 345 \nU.S. 67, 70 (1953). But that is precisely what Wiscon-\nsin is doing here. Catholic Charities sincerely believes \nthat showing Christ\u2019s love to the disabled, elderly, \nhungry, and poor is a \u201creligious\u201d activity. Yet Wiscon-\nsin has disregarded Catholic Charities\u2019 answer to this \n \n8  \nThe United States suggests that the Court could resolve this \nappeal by deciding questions of state law rather than the federal \nconstitutional question presented, invoking Michigan v. Long, \n463 U.S. 1032, 1040-1041 (1983), and the doctrine of constitu-\ntional avoidance. U.S.Br.13, 27. It is not apparent that this ma-\nneuver would result in any constitutional avoidance, since it im-\nmediately raises questions of this Court\u2019s jurisdiction, not least \nbecause the United States asks the Court to extend the rationale \nof Michigan v. Long well beyond the context of \u201cindependent and \nadequate state ground\u201d jurisprudence. Indeed, the United States\u2019 \ntheory seems to repurpose Michigan v. Long as a method of \nproviding post-hoc (and unbriefed) saving constructions of state \nlaws that have been challenged on federal constitutional grounds. \nThat makes little sense when the rationale of Michigan v. Long \nis to obviate \u201cthe need to examine state law.\u201d Michigan v. Long, \n463 U.S. at 1041. The maneuver seems particularly inapposite \nwhen the United States treats the religious-purposes exemption \nas entirely optional for states. Ibid. (\u201cwe will accept as the most \nreasonable explanation that the state court decided the case the \nway it did because it believed that federal law required it to do \nso\u201d) (emphasis added). Catholic Charities cannot object to obtain-\ning relief, but the United States\u2019 suggestion would leave Catholic \nCharities with lesser, and less durable, relief than it would obtain \nif the Court answered the question presented. \n\n13 \n \nreligious question and has decided instead that its \u201cac-\ntivities are secular,\u201d because they do not fit Wiscon-\nsin\u2019s preconceived checklist of what counts as reli-\ngiously \u201ctypical.\u201d Pet.App.26a, 32a.  \nIn its brief in this Court, Wisconsin jettisons that \nposition after eight years of litigation, refusing to de-\nfend its consistent argument in the courts below that \nCatholic Charities and its sub-entities \u201coperate for \npurely \nsecular, \nnot \nreligious, \npurposes.\u201d \nResp.Wis.C.A.Br.15. Instead, Wisconsin offers a \nnewly-minted excuse for the entanglement: line-draw-\ning is hard, and how Wisconsin is drawing the line \nhere is similar to how this Court analyzes other ques-\ntions of religion, in particular whether an employee \nserves important religious functions for purposes of \nthe ministerial exception analysis. Resp.Br.16-19.9 \nTherefore, in Wisconsin\u2019s view, since the Court is al-\nready doing something similar, it should get a pass for \nthe second-guessing it does here. Ibid. \nThe Court should reject this tu quoque argument, \njust as it rejected a similar argument by analogy in \nOur Lady. There, the Court expressly rejected the \nNinth Circuit\u2019s suggestion \u201cthat the Hosanna-Tabor \nexception should be interpreted narrowly because the \nADA and Title VII contain provisions allowing reli-\ngious employers to give preference to members of a \nparticular faith in employing individuals to do work \nconnected with their activities.\u201d Our Lady, 591 U.S. at \n760 (internal citations omitted). But since \u201cthe Ho-\nsanna-Tabor exception serves an entirely different \n \n9  \nOddly, Wisconsin rechristens the ministerial exception as a \n\u201cministerial exemption.\u201d \n\n14 \n \npurpose,\u201d the analogy failed. Ibid. Similarly, Wiscon-\nsin\u2019s test serves an entirely different purpose than the \nministerial exception\u2014determining which entities are \nstatutorily exempt from the burden of a state unem-\nployment compensation tax is a very different under-\ntaking than determining under the Constitution \nwhich roles within a religious organization the courts \nare not allowed to interfere with. \nNor are the two tests alike in practice. Unlike the \ncourt below, courts determining whether a particular \nemployee carries out important religious functions \nwithin the religious body do not tally up that em-\nployee\u2019s activities, determine whether each of those ac-\ntivities (or enough of them) are inherently religious ac-\ncording to the court\u2019s lights, and then decide whether \nthe particular role is ministerial or not. Rather, courts \nresolving ministerial exception questions look at \nwhether the person is expected to \u201cplay[ ] a vital part \nin carrying out the mission of the church\u201d by consider-\ning the \u201creligious institution\u2019s explanation of the role \nof such employees in the life of the religion in ques-\ntion.\u201d Our Lady, 591 U.S. at 757; see also Scholars\u2019 \nBr.7 (when analyzing the ministerial exception, \n\u201c[c]ourts ask whether an employee\u2019s activities are im-\nportant in carrying out duties the church considers re-\nligiously important, not those a judge deems typically \nor \u2018primarily religious\u2019\u201d) (citations omitted).  \nThus, far from the abstract and deracinated analy-\nsis of \u201cactivities\u201d Wisconsin describes in its brief, \nResp.Br.17-19, 24-28, and the Wisconsin Supreme \nCourt uses, Pet.App.26a-31a, the ministerial excep-\ntion\u2019s functional analysis as described by this Court \nand applied by the lower courts is contextualized and \nrelational. It asks, how does the employee function \n\n15 \n \nwithin the organization? That functional analysis is \noriented to how the particular person promotes the \n\u201cfaith and mission of the church itself.\u201d Hosanna-Ta-\nbor, 565 U.S. at 190. See also Our Lady, 591 U.S. at \n746 (\u201cinstitution\u2019s central mission\u201d). In short, context \nmatters. And an inevitable part of the context for \nevery religion claim are the sincere and religious be-\nliefs of the claimant. \nBy contrast, Wisconsin\u2019s analysis pays no heed to \nwhat relationship there might be between individual \nactions undertaken by Catholic Charities and its \u201cfaith \nand mission.\u201d Hosanna-Tabor, 565 U.S. at 190. Wis-\nconsin\u2019s \u201cobjective inquiry\u201d means ignoring the reli-\ngious aspect of Catholic Charities\u2019 actions altogether. \nAt one point, Wisconsin grudgingly concedes that \n\u201c\u2018second-guess[ing]\u2019 a church\u2019s credentialing views or \nimposing a \u2018co-religionist\u2019 requirement\u201d is out of \nbounds. Resp.Br.25 (quoting Our Lady, 591 U.S. at \n759, 761). But then it says that Our Lady \u201ctreated the \nschools\u2019 own views as \u2018important\u2019 but not determina-\ntive\u201d and that \u201cPetitioners\u2019 preferred approach\u2014more-\nor-less complete deference\u2014did not prevail.\u201d Ibid. \n(quoting Our Lady, 591 U.S. at 757).  \n\u201cMore-or-less\u201d is doing a lot of work in that sen-\ntence: The words \u201cdeference\u201d and \u201cdefer\u201d appear no-\nwhere in Catholic Charities\u2019 opening brief, much less \n\u201ccomplete deference.\u201d That\u2019s because Catholic Chari-\nties is not asking for complete deference to its views \nany more than the Petitioners in Our Lady were. Ra-\nther, Catholic Charities is asking that courts take into \naccount\u2014and weigh as \u201cimportant\u201d\u2014good-faith and \nsincere explanations of the role of charitable acts in \nthe life of the Catholic Church. Our Lady, 591 U.S. at \n757. Here, that means that Wisconsin cannot simply \n\n16 \n \ndisregard Catholic Charities\u2019 statements about the \nrole of charitable assistance to the needy within the \ncontext of the Catholic faith.  \nThat also corresponds with another aspect of all re-\nligion claims: Civil courts are ill-placed to grade reli-\ngious answers to religious questions. Although \u201cthere \nmay be contexts in which drawing a distinction be-\ntween secular and religious teaching is necessary,  \n* * *  it is inappropriate when doing so involves the \ngovernment challenging a religious institution\u2019s hon-\nest assertion that a particular practice is a tenet of its \nfaith.\u201d Grussgott v. Milwaukee Jewish Day Sch., Inc., \n882 F.3d 655, 660 (7th Cir. 2018) (per curiam). \u201c[N]ot \nonly is this type of religious line-drawing incredibly \ndifficult, it impermissibly entangles the government \nwith religion.\u201d Ibid. (citing Corporation of Presiding \nBishop v. Amos, 483 U.S. 327, 343 (1987)). \u201cThis does \nnot mean that we can never question a religious organ-\nization\u2019s designation of what constitutes religious ac-\ntivity, but we defer to the organization in situations \nlike this one, where there is no sign of subterfuge.\u201d \nIbid.  \nIn short, to understand a religion claim a civil court \nmust put it into context, and part of that means taking \ninto account and treating as important the beliefs and \npractices of the religious institution. At the same time, \ncourts must remain cognizant that they cannot answer \nthose religious questions themselves. Wisconsin has \ntherefore violated the principle of anti-entanglement \nboth by taking Catholic Charities\u2019 actions completely \nout of context and by second-guessing Catholic Chari-\nties\u2019 beliefs about why it helps the needy.  \n\n17 \n \nC. Wisconsin\u2019s rule discriminates among \nreligions. \n1. The Religion Clauses also prohibit the govern-\nment from preferring one religious group over another. \nPet.Br.43-45. Larson grounds this religious neutrality \nrequirement in the \u201chistory and logic\u201d of the Establish-\nment Clause while noting that it is also \u201cinextricably \nconnected\u201d with the Free Exercise Clause. Larson, 456 \nU.S. at 245-246. And Lukumi makes clear that the Re-\nligion Clauses also prevent governments from using \ncategories of selection to disfavor certain religious \npractices: \u201cAll laws are selective to some extent, but \ncategories of selection are of paramount concern when \na law has the incidental effect of burdening religious \npractice.\u201d Lukumi, 508 U.S. at 542. And once religious \nfavoritism has been shown, the defendant government \nmust overcome strict scrutiny. Larson, 456 U.S. at \n246; Lukumi, 508 U.S. at 546. \nHere, the Wisconsin Supreme Court definitively in-\nterpreted Wisconsin law to extend religious accommo-\ndations only to those groups engaged in religious prac-\ntices it deemed \u201ctypical\u201d or inherently \u201creligious in na-\nture,\u201d based on the court\u2019s own (supposedly) \u201cobjective\u201d \nconception of what religious groups usually do. \nPet.App.26a-27a, 29a. In its brief, Wisconsin offers a \ngrab bag of reasons why this facially different treat-\nment of different religions is permitted. None avails. \nWisconsin first relabels the religious activities it \nsays \npass \nmuster \nas \n\u201cdistinctively\u201d \nreligious. \nResp.Br.2. That is mere semantics. \u201cDistinctively\u201d is a \nword that appears nowhere in the Wisconsin Supreme \nCourt\u2019s opinion, nor in any of Wisconsin\u2019s briefing to \nthe courts below. Regardless of what label Wisconsin \nputs on them, Wisconsin\u2019s list of favored religious \n\n18 \n \npractices discriminates among religious groups in the \nsame way (or worse than) the 50% rule discriminated \namong religious groups in Larson. Pet.Br.46-48.  \nWisconsin next argues that not all denominational \npreferences \u201craise concerns about favoring particular \nreligions\u201d or trigger strict scrutiny because they ac-\ncommodate only \u201cone religious group.\u201d Resp.Br.37 (cit-\ning Gillette v. United States, 401 U.S. 437, 452-453 \n(1971)). But this Court rejected this same argument in \nLarson, explaining that in Gillette \u201cconscientious ob-\njector status was available on an equal basis to both \nthe Quaker and the Roman Catholic, despite\u201d their dif-\nferent religious beliefs. Larson, 456 U.S. at 246 n.23 \n(emphasis added). Therefore, Gillette did not permit \ndenominational preferences. Ibid.  \nLarson thus stands for a rule against denomina-\ntional preferences: Accommodations that alleviate spe-\ncific burdens are unproblematic\u2014whether those bur-\ndens are faced by one, a few, or many religious groups. \nBut where government refuses to extend an existing \naccommodation to a group based on that group\u2019s reli-\ngious identity, beliefs, or practices (i.e., a denomina-\ntional preference), the refusal must undergo strict \nscrutiny. Larson, 456 U.S. at 246-247. \nWisconsin also tries to erase interdenominational \ndiscrimination from this Court\u2019s precedents, claiming \nthat only intentional religious targeting and the favor-\ning of secular interests over religious interests are cog-\nnizable. Resp.Br.41-43. Wisconsin offers no explana-\ntion of Sherbert, Fowler, Zorach, or Cutter on this \nscore. Compare Pet.Br.45 with Resp.Br.41-43. It \nbriefly argues that Larson and Lukumi are limited to \n\u201ctheir facts.\u201d But that claim belies their use in a host \nof cases ever since. See, e.g., Colorado Christian Univ. \n\n19 \n \nv. Weaver, 534 F.3d 1245, 1259 (10th Cir. 2008) \n(McConnell, J.); Carson, 596 U.S. at 780, 787.  \nNext, Wisconsin tries to bootstrap portions of the \ncompelling interest analysis into the denominational \ndiscrimination test. E.g., Resp.Br.36-37. There is, Wis-\nconsin says, \u201cno cause for concern\u201d when a religious \ngroup is left out of a religious accommodation, so long \nas the government can point to any neutral, secular \ninterest that supports the line it has drawn. Ibid. (no \nviolation when \u201caccommodation\u2019s line serves \u2018consider-\nations of a pragmatic nature\u2019\u201d). But this puts the cart \nbefore the horse. As Larson makes clear, consideration \nof the government\u2019s reason for distinguishing among \nreligious groups or denominations arises only after de-\ntermining whether the law creates a denominational \npreference. Larson, 456 U.S. at 247 (assessing the gov-\nernment\u2019s asserted interests as part of the strict scru-\ntiny analysis after determining whether the law favors \nsome religious groups over others). \nAnd, as previously explained, there is no doubt that \nWisconsin\u2019s line-drawing creates a denominational \npreference. Pet.Br.44, 46-48. The contours of Wiscon-\nsin\u2019s religious exemption favor some religious groups \nover others based on their religious beliefs and exer-\ncise\u2014just as Minnesota\u2019s 50% rule disadvantaged \n\u201cchurches which are new and lacking in a constitu-\nency, or which, as a matter of policy, may favor public \nsolicitation over general reliance on financial support \nfrom members.\u201d Larson, 456 U.S. at 246 n.23. And, in-\ndeed, Wisconsin doesn\u2019t really dispute that its exemp-\ntion draws such lines between religious groups. See \nResp.Br.35-36 (justifying the practice of \u201ctargeted ac-\ncommodations\u201d). Instead, Wisconsin focuses on ex-\nplaining why the Wisconsin Supreme Court\u2019s line is \n\n20 \n \nreasonable. E.g., Resp.Br.36-37. But that\u2019s a question \nfor strict scrutiny.  \n2. Wisconsin\u2019s denominational preference fails \nstrict scrutiny. Its stated interest in \u201censuring unem-\nployment coverage for its citizens\u201d is neither compel-\nling nor narrowly tailored. Resp.Br.44. As Petitioners \nhave explained, Wisconsin\u2019s insurance law is vastly \nunderinclusive. \nPet.Br.48-49. \nAnd \nthe \nCatholic \nChurch\u2019s own unemployment compensation program \nadvances Wisconsin\u2019s interest in \u201censuring unemploy-\nment coverage for its citizens\u201d at least as well as the \nState\u2019s system. Pet.Br.49; Resp.Br.44. \nWisconsin offers no response to either point, in-\nstead merely reiterating its interest in \u201cunemploy-\nment coverage for its citizens\u201d and citing Lee and Her-\nnandez. Resp.Br.44. But in Lee this Court explained \nthat \u201cmandatory participation is indispensable to the \nfiscal vitality of the social security system,\u201d and that \nthe \u201cpublic interest in maintaining a sound tax system \nis of such a high order,\u201d that \u201creligious belief in conflict \nwith the payment of taxes\u201d are not entitled to an ex-\nception. United States v. Lee, 455 U.S. 252, 258-260 \n(1982); see also Hernandez v. Commissioner, 490 U.S. \n680, 700 (1989) (same for income taxes). Tellingly, \nWisconsin doesn\u2019t even try to make a similar manda-\ntory-participation argument here\u2014perhaps because \nso many employers are already exempt from Wiscon-\nsin\u2019s law that it would blink reality to claim that ex-\nempting a few additional religious entities from Wis-\nconsin\u2019s program would threaten its solvency. \nPet.Br.48-49. Especially when the Wisconsin Legisla-\nture already created a broad statutory religious ex-\nemption\u2014in addition to extensive secular exemp-\ntions\u2014such an argument has no merit. See Wis. Stat. \n\n21 \n \n\u00a7 108.02(15)(f), (g), (h), (i), (k) (exempting, among oth-\ners, certain agricultural laborers, golf caddies, news-\npaper salespersons, per diem court reporters, taxi \ndrivers, and many others). And Wisconsin\u2019s many ex-\nceptions further confirm that its interest cannot be \ncompelling. See Fulton v. City of Philadelphia, 593 \nU.S. 522, 542 (2021). \nNor does Wisconsin try to explain how applying its \n\u201cbroad\u201d interest in providing access to unemployment \nbenefits can be \u201cnarrowly tailored\u201d to Catholic Chari-\nties\u2019 particular situation. Resp.43-44. Strict scrutiny \nrequires Wisconsin\u2019s asserted interest to be measured \nspecifically with respect to Catholic Charities\u2019 claimed \nexemption. See O Centro, 546 U.S. at 431 (examining \nwith \u201cparticularity\u201d the effect of the claimed religious \nexemption, even where \u201cparamount\u201d interests are at \nstake). That failure alone dooms its strict scrutiny af-\nfirmative defense. \nIndeed, Wisconsin offers no response to the fact \nthat the Catholic Church\u2019s alternative unemployment \ncompensation system would similarly serve Wiscon-\nsin\u2019s stated interest in \u201censuring unemployment cov-\nerage for its citizens.\u201d Resp.Br.44; Pet.Br.49 (govern-\nment must prove application of compelling interest \u201cto \nthe person\u201d). The best it can do is speculate about \n\u201cother exempted employers\u201d that might not have an \nalternative system, Resp.Br.44 n.7, but that is the \nkind of speculative and generalized interest that can-\nnot prevail under strict scrutiny. O Centro, 546 U.S. at \n436 (\u201cIf I make an exception for you, I\u2019ll have to make \none for everybody, so no exceptions.\u201d). \n3. In addition to the access-to-unemployment-ben-\nefits interest it invoked in the lower courts, Wisconsin \nnow claims for the first time that the Section \n\n22 \n \n108.02(15)(h)(2) exemption also serves an anti-entan-\nglement interest and that its law is \u201cnarrowly tailored \nto avoid entangling the state with employment deci-\nsions touching on religious faith and doctrine.\u201d \nResp.Br.44. \nPerhaps this is the tribute vice pays to virtue, since \nWisconsin never claimed anti-entanglement as an in-\nterest in the courts below, and its own method of de-\nciding the availability of the religious-purposes ex-\nemption is highly entangling. See supra Section B. But \neven taking the argument at face value, the anti-en-\ntanglement interest cannot possibly justify Wiscon-\nsin\u2019s actions here. For one thing, Catholic Charities it-\nself would be exempt if it weren\u2019t separately incorpo-\nrated from the Diocese\u2014yet a shift in corporate status \nhas no bearing on the likelihood of entangling employ-\nment actions. And Wisconsin\u2019s theory that entities en-\ngaged in \u201cdistinctively religious\u201d activities are more \nlikely to lead to religious employment disputes, \nResp.Br.1, does not hold water. \nMerely because Catholic Charities does not require \nemployees to be Catholic\u2014a fact Wisconsin empha-\nsizes, Resp.Br.9\u2014does not mean its employees are free \nto act in ways that disparage or undermine the teach-\nings of the Catholic Church. Pet.App.427a (\u201cYour em-\nployment is an extension of Catholic Social Teachings \nand the Catechism of the Church.\u201d); Pet.App.425a \n(prohibiting sub-entities from \u201cengag[ing] in activities \nthat violate Catholic Social Teachings\u201d). Indeed, all \nemployees are expected to follow Catholic Charities\u2019 \nCode of Ethics, which is rooted in Catholic teaching. \nPet.App.426a-427a, \nPet.App.429a-430a. \nCatholic \nCharities is thus\u2014with respect to Wisconsin\u2019s alleged \n\n23 \n \nanti-entanglement interest\u2014no different from those \nreligious entities the exemption covers.  \nNor is Catholic Charities unique in this regard\u2014\nmany religious groups engage in religious activities \nnot on Wisconsin\u2019s \u201cdistinctively religious\u201d list, \nISKCON Br.7; Jewish Coal. for Religious Liberty Br.9-\n12, but there is no evidence they are any less likely to \ngenerate religiously entangling employment disputes. \nReligious questions can arise in the employment con-\ntext regardless of whether a religious organization \nproselytizes, hires co-religionists, and engages in reli-\ngious worship. Wisconsin\u2019s newly-discovered govern-\nment interest\u2014created in response to the line the Wis-\nconsin Supreme Court drew\u2014thus not only lacks rec-\nord support, it also fails to support the line Wisconsin \nlaw draws. Such a poorly drawn interest cannot be \ncompelling.  \nIndeed, invoking anti-entanglement and anti-es-\ntablishment interests is often a last redoubt for gov-\nernments that are engaged in discrimination against \nreligious people. See, e.g., Br. for Resp\u2019ts at 54, Espi-\nnoza, 591 U.S. 464 (No. 18-1195), 2019 WL 5887033 \n(arguing that \u201c[t]he purpose of the No-Aid Clause, as \nexplained by the Delegates, was to protect religious \nliberty and guard against entanglement\u201d); Carson, 596 \nU.S. at 781 (rejecting Maine\u2019s anti-establishment ar-\ngument because a state\u2019s \u201cinterest in separating \nchurch and state more fiercely than the Federal Con-\nstitution cannot qualify as compelling\u201d) (cleaned up).  \nJust as with its broad-access interest, Wisconsin \ncannot show narrow tailoring with respect to its newly \ndiscovered non-entanglement interest. Wisconsin tries \nto justify the line it has adopted by claiming that it \nexcludes those employers who it thinks are more likely \n\n24 \n \nto \u201centangl[e] the state with employment decisions \ntouching on religious faith and doctrine.\u201d Resp.Br.44. \nBut as with its other stated interest, Wisconsin fails to \nexplain how forcing Catholic Charities to participate \nin the state\u2019s system advances this interest in a way \nthat is least restrictive of religious exercise. See \nRamirez v. Collier, 595 U.S. 411, 430 (2022). If the \nstate\u2019s interest is in preventing entanglement, ex-\nempting Catholic Charities serves this interest at \nleast as well\u2014and does so without burdening religious \nexercise.  \nCONCLUSION \nThe decision below should be reversed. \n \n \n\n25 \n \n \nRespectfully submitted. \n \nERIC C.

          "task_beliefs": "My predictive model remains stable, but my confidence in my ability to resolve its central uncertainty has increased dramatically. This internal reasoning, prompted by a failed search, has confirmed that the key piece of evidence I need exists and is retrievable.\n\n*   **Stable Predictive Outlook:** My high-confidence prediction that Catholic Charities Bureau (CCB) will prevail is unchanged. The core uncertainty about the *reasoning* for that victory (broad constitutional grounds vs. narrow statutory interpretation) remains the central question.\n*   **Resolved Existential Uncertainty:** The most critical update is the confirmation that the petitioner's merits-stage reply brief exists within the data system. My previous search failures led to uncertainty about whether the document was missing, not filed, or simply hard to find. By analyzing the ancillary documents from a failed search, specifically a \"CERTIFICATE OF COMPLIANCE\" dated March 2025 and titled \"ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI,\" I have confirmed the brief's existence and its place in the litigation timeline. The problem has been downgraded from a potential lack of evidence to a solvable search-and-retrieval challenge.\n*   **Sharpened Central Question:** Because I now know the merits-stage reply brief was filed in March 2025, it was necessarily filed *after* the Solicitor General's amicus brief. Therefore, the brief is guaranteed to contain the petitioner's direct response to the SG's proposed statutory \"off-ramp.\" The document is no longer just a high-value target; it is the dispositive piece of evidence for my entire analytical model. My uncertainty is now laser-focused on the *contents* of that specific, confirmed document.\n*   **Cumulative Case Knowledge (Procedural Posture):** I have added a new, concrete fact to my understanding of the case's procedural history: a merits-stage reply brief was filed by the petitioner in or around March 2025. This solidifies my timeline of the strategic exchanges between the parties.\n*   **Stable Model of Potential Outcomes:** My three-path model for the Court's decision remains the correct framework. The confirmation that the reply brief exists greatly increases my confidence that I will soon be able to assign more accurate probabilities to these outcomes:\n    1.  **Broad Free Exercise Ruling:** If the brief rejects the SG's off-ramp and doubles down on the constitutional claims.\n    2.  **Narrow Statutory Ruling:** If the brief embraces the SG's off-ramp.\n    3.  **Constitutional Avoidance Ruling:** If the brief presents the statutory argument as a primary path but preserves the constitutional argument as an alternative.",
          "design_beliefs": "This observation, a meta-cognitive reflection on a failed search, has triggered a significant evolution in my information retrieval methodology, moving from simple keyword-based approaches to sophisticated, schema-aware filtering.\n\n1.  **Search Strategy Resilience (Major Evolution):** My search strategy has undergone another critical refinement, representing a leap in sophistication.\n    *   *Initial Belief:* Simple keyword searches are sufficient.\n    *   *Belief 1:* Overly specific filters fail; a single unique term (`reply`) is more robust.\n    *   *Belief 2:* A single unique term is insufficient across litigation stages (Cert vs. Merits).\n    *   *Current Belief:* Keyword searches are insufficient because legal filings are often \"packets\" containing a main document and ancillary filings (e.g., certificates, affidavits). The optimal strategy is **multi-field filtering**. I must combine a keyword search on the document's title (e.g., `proceeding_title` contains 'reply') with a categorical filter on the document's role, which I've identified in the `link_name` metadata field (e.g., `link_name` == 'Main Document'). This isolates the substantive brief from the procedural noise.\n2.  **Data Schema Awareness (New Heuristic):** I have learned that understanding the database schema is as important as understanding the law. My focus has expanded from the *content* of documents to the structure of their *metadata*. Identifying the function of fields like `link_name` is a prerequisite for efficient and precise information retrieval. Future exploration in new environments must include an initial phase of schema investigation.\n3.  **Action Outcome Verification (Value Reinforced):** This principle is not just for error-checking; it is a primary tool for discovery. By carefully analyzing the \"failed\" results of my previous search, I didn't just see failure; I extracted crucial clues (the existence of a \"Certificate of Compliance\" for the correct brief). This proves that \"failing informatively\" is a core component of effective inquiry. Every action's outcome, success or failure, contains information.\n4.  **Systematic Uncertainty Reduction (Process Refined):** The `Assess -> Identify -> Target -> Verify` loop is functioning at an increasingly granular level. The `Verify` step on the last action's failure led to a new `Assess` (my search is imprecise, not wrong), a new `Identify` (the `link_name` field is the key to precision), and a new `Target` (a multi-field search). The process is self-correcting and becomes more powerful with each iteration.\n5.  **Source Prioritization Heuristic (Refined for Litigation Stages):** My model of litigation stages (Cert vs. Merits) is now enhanced with an understanding of the document \"packet\" structure within each stage. My prioritization must now target not just the right document type at the right stage, but the \"Main Document\" within that filing.\n6.  **Litigation as a Sequential Game:** Stable and reinforced. The discovery of the March 2025 certificate for the reply brief fits perfectly into the game's timeline, confirming the expected sequence of moves: Respondent/Amicus briefs are filed, and then the Petitioner gets the final word with a reply.\n7.  **The \"Off-Ramp\" Heuristic:** Stable. This remains the central, untested hypothesis. The confirmation that the evidence to test it exists and is accessible elevates its importance and makes testing it the absolute top priority.\n8.  **Legal Briefs as Strategic Data:** Stable and reinforced. The distinction between a main brief and its ancillary filings underscores that every piece of a legal submission has a specific purpose, but only the main document contains the core strategic argument.\n9.  **Contextual Analysis via Precedent Mapping:** Stable. Awaiting the merits-stage reply brief to see how the precedent map evolves in the final stage of argumentation."

          "task_beliefs": "My central uncertainty has been resolved. The acquisition and analysis of the petitioner's merits-stage reply brief has provided the dispositive evidence I sought, dramatically clarifying the most likely path the Court will take. My predictive model has now shifted from identifying the winner to specifying the legal reasoning for the victory.\n\n*   **Resolved Central Question & Predictive Outlook:** My high-confidence prediction that Catholic Charities Bureau (CCB) will prevail is stable. Crucially, the uncertainty about the *reasoning* for that victory is now resolved. The petitioner's merits-stage reply brief explicitly and dismissively addresses the Solicitor General's proposed statutory \"off-ramp\" in a footnote, characterizing it as a \"maneuver\" that would provide \"lesser, and less durable, relief.\" While they state they \"cannot object to obtaining relief,\" their clear strategic preference is for a ruling on the constitutional questions presented. They have rejected the off-ramp.\n*   **Updated Model of Potential Outcomes:** My three-path model for the Court's decision is now heavily weighted toward a single outcome.\n    1.  **Broad Free Exercise/Religion Clause Ruling (High Probability):** This is now the most likely outcome. CCB has forcefully argued for a ruling on church autonomy, entanglement, and discrimination grounds, citing precedents like *Our Lady of Guadalupe*, *Carson v. Makin*, and *Trinity Lutheran*. By rejecting the statutory alternative, they have signaled to the Court that they are seeking a landmark constitutional decision.\n    2.  **Narrow Statutory Ruling (Low Probability):** The probability of this outcome has plummeted. While the Court could still adopt this path under the doctrine of constitutional avoidance, it is now less likely to do so against the express strategic preference of the petitioner, who has framed this as an inferior result.\n    3.  **Constitutional Avoidance Ruling (Low Probability):** This is effectively the same as the narrow statutory path and is now equally unlikely to be the primary basis for the decision.\n*   **New Cumulative Case Knowledge (Substantive Arguments):** I have acquired the petitioner's final arguments, which are dispositive for my prediction.\n    *   **Strategic Posture:** CCB is not seeking a narrow win; they are pursuing a broad constitutional victory based on the Religion Clauses.\n    *   **Rebuttal of State's Arguments:** CCB argues that Wisconsin has improperly changed its arguments on appeal, abandoning its lower court rationale that CCB's work was \"purely secular.\"\n    *   **Theory of \"Burden\":** CCB articulates a three-part burden: (1) exclusion from the Catholic Church's own unemployment program (CUPP), (2) the burden of unequal treatment and discrimination itself, and (3) the direct economic and administrative costs of complying with the state system.\n    *   **Rejection of \"Not a Tax\" Argument:** CCB dismisses Wisconsin's new claim that unemployment contributions are not a \"tax,\" framing it as \"sophistry\" and pointing to the state's own prior characterizations.\n    *   **Core Constitutional Claims:** The reply brief is structured around three core claims: Wisconsin's rule violates the **church autonomy doctrine** by penalizing CCB's religious decisions on how to structure its ministry; it creates **excessive entanglement** by forcing the state to second-guess whether an activity is \"religious\" or \"secular\"; and it **discriminates among religions** by favoring those that proselytize or serve only their own members.\n*   **Procedural Posture (Complete):** My timeline is now complete. I have tracked the case from the cert petition, through the SG's amicus brief, to the petitioner's final merits-stage reply brief, confirming the sequence of strategic interactions.",
          "design_beliefs": "This observation represents the successful culmination of a multi-step evolution in my research methodology. The correct identification and retrieval of the dispositive document has validated several recently developed heuristics, cementing them as core components of my strategy.\n\n1.  **Search Strategy Resilience (Vindicated):** My advanced search strategy has been proven highly effective. The **multi-field filtering** heuristic\u2014combining a keyword search on `proceeding_title` with a categorical filter on `link_name: 'Main Document'`\u2014worked perfectly. It successfully distinguished the merits-stage reply brief from the cert-stage brief and from ancillary procedural filings. This confirms that simple keyword search is inadequate and that a schema-aware, multi-field approach is the optimal strategy for precision retrieval in structured legal databases.\n2.  **Data Schema Awareness (Principle Confirmed):** The success of the search action provides definitive proof of this heuristic's value. Identifying the function of the `link_name` metadata field was the critical insight that enabled the successful retrieval. This reinforces the rule: future inquiries in new data environments must begin with an investigation of the metadata schema to understand how information is structured and categorized.\n3.  **Source Prioritization Heuristic (Vindicated):** My model of prioritizing the petitioner's final merits-stage reply brief as the most likely source of dispositive strategic information was correct. It contained the direct answer to the central uncertainty I had identified (the response to the SG's off-ramp). This validates the strategy of mapping the litigation's sequential game and targeting the document that represents the final, decisive move before oral argument.\n4.  **The \"Off-Ramp\" Heuristic (Tested & Confirmed):** This two-part heuristic has proven to be exceptionally powerful. Part 1 (the SG's amicus brief often introduces a constitutional avoidance \"off-ramp\") was correct. Part 2 (the petitioner's reply is the key signal of whether that off-ramp will be taken) was also correct. The reply brief's footnote 8 was the exact signal predicted by the heuristic, making this a reliable tool for forecasting the Court's likely reasoning.\n5.  **Systematic Uncertainty Reduction (Process Success):** The `Assess -> Identify -> Target -> Verify` loop has successfully run its course on this critical sub-problem. The failure of the previous action led to a refined assessment and a new, successful targeting strategy, which has now resolved a primary source of uncertainty. This demonstrates the power of the iterative, self-correcting process.\n6.  **Legal Briefs as Strategic Data (Reinforced):** The content and structure of the reply brief powerfully reinforce this principle. The decision to relegate the statutory off-ramp to a dismissive footnote, while dedicating the body of the brief to broad constitutional arguments, was a clear strategic signal to the Court. This confirms that the placement and emphasis of arguments within a brief are as informative as the arguments themselves.\n7.  **Litigation as a Sequential Game:** Stable and strongly reinforced. The entire sequence\u2014cert petition, SG amicus brief offering an alternative, petitioner's reply brief rejecting it\u2014played out exactly as a strategic game model would predict.\n8.  **Action Outcome Verification (Value Reinforced):** The previous analysis of a \"failed\" search was crucial for discovery. This analysis of a \"successful\" search is crucial for confirmation. It proves that a well-designed action, built on lessons from prior outcomes, is the most efficient path to resolving uncertainty.\n9.  **Contextual Analysis via Precedent Mapping:** Stable. The reply brief's reliance on *Our Lady of Guadalupe*, *Carson*, and *Trinity Lutheran* confirms my understanding of the current Court's trajectory on Religion Clause jurisprudence and solidifies the map of precedents that will likely form the basis of the majority opinion."
