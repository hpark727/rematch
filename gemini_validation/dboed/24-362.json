    "facts_of_the_case": "In October 2017, six FBI agents, led by Special Agent Lawrence Guerra, mistakenly executed a no-knock search warrant at the home of Curtrina Martin and her family in Atlanta, Georgia. The intended target was a nearby home suspected to contain violent gang member Joseph Riley. Due to similarities between the two properties and issues with navigating to the correct address, the agents entered Martin\u2019s home instead. The SWAT team, in full tactical gear, entered the house, causing fear and distress to its occupants. They later realized the mistake and promptly left the scene, later apologizing and assuring the family that the FBI would handle any damages.\n\nMartin and her family sued the U.S. government and the agents, claiming violations of their Fourth Amendment rights and seeking damages under Georgia state law. The district court granted summary judgment for the defendants. On appeal, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit affirmed the decision, ruling that the agents were entitled to qualified immunity and that the Federal Tort Claims Act claims were barred by the Supremacy Clause and the discretionary function exception.",

The target address\u2014which was report-\nedly the home of Jospeh [sie] Riley, a violent gang mem-\nber\u2014was located approximately a block away from Ap-\npellants\u2019 house and shared similar conspicuous features\nwith Appellants\u2019 house.\n\nAppellants initiated an action against the FBI agents\npursuant to Bivens x: Six Unknown Named Agents of\nFederal Bureau of Narcotics, 403 U.S. 388 (1971) and the\nUnited States under the Federal Tort Claims Act\nFTCA\u201d, alleging that the FBI agents violated their\nFourth Amendment rights and were also liable for dam-\nages under Georgia tort law. The district court granted\nsummary judgment in favor of the FBI agents and the\nUnited States.\n\nda\nAppendix A\nAfter careful review of the record and the parties\u2019\n\nbriefs, we affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary\n{judgment and dismissal of Appellants\u2019 claims.\n\nI. BACKGROUND\n\nOn October 18, 2017, during the predawn hours, a\nteam of six unidentified FBI agents\u2014ted by special\nagent, Lawrence Guerra\u2014exeeuted a presumably valid\nsearch warrant at 3756 Denville Trace, SW, Atlanta,\nGeorgia 80331, Appellants\u2019 home. The target location of\nthe search warrant was 3741 Landau Lane, SW, Atlanta,\nGeorgia 30381, which is located approximately three\nhouses away from Appellants\u2019 house. Despite taking\nseveral precautionary measures to ensure proper exe-\nceution of the search warrant, Guerra and the FBI agents\ninadvertently executed the search warrant at the wrong\nhouse.\n\nA. The FBI's Operation Red Tape\n\nIn 2015, the FBI initiated Operation Red Tape\u2014an\noperation concerning violent gang activity in Georgia.\n\u2018The Operation resulted in a criminal indictment and the\nissuance of arrest warrants for several individuals, in-\ncluding Riley. The FBT assigned Guerra to lead a Special\nWeapons and Tacties (\u201cSWAT\u201d) team that was tasked\nwith executing the arrest warrant for Riley at 8741 Lan-\ndan Lane,\n\nIn preparation for the warrant execution, the FBI\ncreated a general operation order and a SWAT adden-\ndum to the operation order: The SWAT addendum con-\ntained photographs of Riley, a description of his violent\n\nAppendix A\nhistory and gun possession, a photograph of 3741 Li\ndau Lane, SW, Atlanta, Georgia 30331, an overhead map\nimage of the neighborhood, and directions to 3741 Lan-\ndau Lane, Prior to the warrant execution, Guerra re-\nviewed a copy of the general operation order and the\nSWAT addendum.\n\nB. Pro-Execution Preparation\n\n\u2018The FBI has a standard operating procedure that its\nagents conduet a site survey or a drive-by prior to exe-\nceuting a high-risk warrant such as the one for Riley's ar-\nrest. However, the FBI does not have any policies gov-\ncerning how to locate or navigate to a target address nor\ndoes it prohibit using a personal GPS to locate a target\naddress.\n\nShortly before the warrant execution, Guerra and\nanother FBI agent, Gregory Donovan condueted a site\nsurvey of 8741 Landau Lane during daylight hours.\nThey used the Google Maps application on Donovan's\ncellphone to navigate to 8741 Landau Lane.\n\nDuring the site survey, Guerra took several photo-\ngraphs of 8741 Landau Lane, He also documented spe-\ncifie physical features of 3741 Landau Lane that he be-\nlieved were unique to the house, He noted that the house\nwas beige and split-level it was located on a corner lot;\nit had a side-entry garage on a separate street that ran\nperpendicular to the front door; it had a very large tree\nin the front yard; and the house number appeared on a\n\u2018small mailbox and not on the front of the house.\n\n\n6a\nAppendix A\n\nAfter Guerra completed the site survey, he identified\na staging area where the SWAT team would meet prior\nto the warrant execution. Additionally, he made tactical\nnotes of the order in whieh each SWAT team member\n\u2018would position themselves outside of 3741 Landau Lane\nand assigned tasks to each SWAT team member for the\nwarrant execution,\n\nIn addition to completing the site survey, Guerra at-\ntended an operational briefing regarding the warrant\nexecution, The briefing consisted of several presenta-\ntions that included photographs of Riley and 8741 Lan-\ndau Lane,\n\nOn the day of the warrant execution, Guerra and\nFBI special agent, Michael Lemoine, eondueted a pre-\nraid drive-by of 3741 Landau Lane. It was completely\ndark outside when they conducted the pre-raid drive-by.\nGuerra used his personal GPS deviee to navigate to 3741\nLandau Lane. Although he entered 3741 Landau Lane\ninto his GPS deviee, it directed him and Lemoine to 3756\nDenville Trace\u2014Appellants\u2019 house. Appellants\u2019 house is\napproximately 436 feet from 3741 Landau Lane. Alt-\nhough Appellants\u2019 house is located on Denville Trace, it\nfaces Landan Lane,\n\nGuerra believed he was at 8741 Landau Lane be-\ncause Appellants\u2019 house had many of the same features\nthat he noted for the target address during his site sur-\nvey. Similar to 8741 Landau Lane, Appellants\u2019 house\n\n\u00a2; it was located on the corner of the street; it\nwas split-level; it eontained a stairwell to the front door;\nthere was a very large tree in front of the house; it had\n\n\nTa\nAppendix A\n\na side-entry garage on a separate street that ran per-\n\npendicular to the front door; and the house number did\n\nnot appear anywhere on the house, but instead appeared\n\n\u2018on the mailbox. Although the mailbox is visible from the\n\nstreet, the house number is not.\n\nGuerra and Lemoine noticed a black Camaro in Ap-\npellants\u2019 driveway that Guerra did not recall seeing\nwhen he completed his site survey of 8741 Landau Lane\na few days earlier. They would later use the black Ca-\nmaro and a large tree as reference points when search-\ning for the target address for the warrant execution,\n\n. Search Warrant Execution\n\nAround 3:30 am. on the day of the warrant execu-\ntion, Guerra arrived at the staging area and briefed the\n\u2018SWAT team and officers from the Atlanta Police Depart-\nment (\u201cAPD\u201d). Guerra showed the SWAT team mem-\nbers photographs of 3741 Landau Lane and Riley, and\nhe briefed the agents on his tactical plan regarding the\nwarrant execution.\n\nFollowing the briefing and while it was still dark out-\nside, the SWAT team and APD officers\u2014led by\nGuerra\u2014headed towards the target address in a eara-\nvan of vehicles. When Guerra spotted the black Camaro,\nhe stopped his vehicle in front of Appellants\u2019 house, be-\nlieving that he was at 3741 Landau Lane, and the other\nvehicles followed suit. The SWAT team\u2014dressed in full\ntactical gear and armed with rifles and handguns\u2014\nquickly exited the vehicles and reported to their as-\nsigned! locations surrounding Appellants\u2019 house, Guerra\nKnocked and announced the presence of law\n\n8a\nAppendix A\n\nenforcement before an agent breached the front. door.\nAnother agent deployed a flashbang at the entrance of\nthe home. The SWAT team entered the house.\n\nWhen the SWAT team entered Appellants\u2019 house,\nCliatt\u2014afraid that their home was being burglarized\u2014\nrran towards the betlroom closet where he kept a shotgun\nfor protection. As Cliatt ran towards the bedroom\ncloset, Martin bolted towards the door to get her then\nseven-year-old son. However, Cliatt pulled Martin to-\nwards their bedroom closet, and the two hid in there,\n\nA SWAT team member located Cliatt and Martin in\ntheir bedroom closet, dragged Cliatt out of the closet\nand onto the bedroom floor with guns pointed at him,\nand handcuffed him, During the same time, Martin fell\nin the closet, and another SWAT team member pointed\ngun in her face while yelling at her to keep her hands\nup. No one handeuffed or touched Martin, Guerra en-\ntered the bedroom and realized that Cliatt did not have\nthe same face and neck tattoos that he observed in the\nphotographs of Riley, so he asked Cliatt for his name and\naddress, Cliatt provided Guerra with his name and ad-\ndress.\n\nWhile Guerra was in the bedroom questioning Cliatt,\nLemoine noticed a piece of mail that had a different ad-\ndress than 3741 Landau Lane and notified Guerra that\nthey were at the wrong address. Upon realizing that\nthey were at the wrong house, Guerra immediately\nended the raid: an agent lifted Cliat off the ground and\nuuneuffed him; Guerra told Cliatt that he would come\n\n\n9a\nAppendix A\n\nback later and explain what happened; and the agents\nleft the house.\n\nAfter leaving Appellants\u2019 house, Guerra and the\nSWAT team executed the search warrant at $741 Lan-\ndau Lane where they arrested Riley. After executing\nthe search warrant at the target address, Guerra re-\nturned to Appellants\u2019 house, apologized to them, docu-\nmented the damages caused by the mistaken raid, pro-\nvided them with the contact information for his supervi-\nsor, and advised them that the FBI would handle the\ndamage repairs.\n\nShortly after the mistaken raid at Appellants\u2019 house,\nGuerra reported the incident to the appropriate FBT\nrepresentative and completed an incident report.\nGuerra also stopped using his personal GPS for warrant\nexecutions and eventually threw it away.\n\nD. Lawsuit\n\nIn September 2019, Appellants brought a Bivens\nclaim against Guerra and the six unidentified FBI\nagents who participated in the raid, alleging that Guerra\nand the agents\u2019 mistaken execution of the search war-\nrant at their house violated their Fourth Amendment\nrights. They also brought state law claims for negli-\ngence, negligent/intentional infliction of emotional dis-\ntress, trespass and interference with private property,\nfalse arrest/false imprisonment, and assault and battery\nagainst the United States under the FTCA. Guerra and\nthe government moved for summary judgment on Ap-\npellants\u2019 claims.\n\n\nWa\nAppendix A\n\n\u2018The distriet court granted in part and denied in part\nthe motion for summary judgment. Specifically, the dis-\ntrict court granted summary judgment on Appellants\u2019\nBivens claim and state law elaims for negligenee, negli-\ngent infliction of emotional distress, and trespass. How-\never, the district court denied summary judgment on the\nfalse imprisonment and assault and battery claims,\n\nFollowing the distrit court's grant of partial sum-\nmary judgment, the parties filed eross motions for re-\nconsideration. The distriet court held that, given our re-\ncent decision in Kordash v: United States, 51 Fath 1289\n(Lith Cir. 2022), the Supremacy Clause defense barred\nAppellants\u2019 remaining FTCA tort claims.\n\n\u2018The district court entered judgment and Appellants\ntimely appealed.\n\nI STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\nWe review the district court\u2019s grant of summary\njudgment de novo, Holloman v. Mail- Well Corp, 443 F.3d\n\u2018S32, 836 (11th Cir. 2006), and denial of a motion for re-\nconsideration for abuse of discretion. Corwin v. Walt\nDisney Co., 475 F:3d 1239, 1254 (11th Cir, 2007).

However, we must only view the evi-\ndence in alight most favorable to the non-moving party\ntothe extent that the non-moving party's position is up-\nported by the record, Zd. Therefore, simply because\nsome alleged factual dispute exists between the parties\ndoes not mean summary judgment cannot be otherwise\ngranted. Scott\u00bb: Harris, 550 US. 372,380 2007).\n\nIIL DISCUSSION\n\nA, The District Court Properly Determined\nthat Qualified Immunity Protects Guerra\nfrom Suit.\n\nAppellants argue that Guerra is not entitled to qual-\nified immunity because his mistaken execution of the\nsearch warrant at their house was not a reasonable mis-\ntake and, therefore, his conduet violated the Fourth\nAmendment.\n\nQualified immunity protects government actors per-\nforming diseretionary functions from civil liability.\nAndujar v. Rodriquez, 486 Fd 1199, 1202 (11th Cin.\n2007) (quotation marks and citation omitted). Govern-\nment officials are entitled to qualified immunity unless\n\n1a\nAppendix A\n\ntheir conduct violates \u201cclearly established statutory or\n\nconstitutional rights of which a reasonable person would\n\nhave known.\u201d Merricks v, Adkisson, 785 F3d 553, 558\n\n(1th Cir. 2015) (quoting Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 US.\n\n800, 818 (1982)\n\n\u2018To \u201cresolv{e] questions of qualified immunity at sum-\nmary judgment,\u201d we conduct \u201ca two-pronged inquiry.\u201d\nTolan v. Cotton, 572 U.S. 650, 655 (2014) (quotation\nmarks and citation omitted). First, we ask \u201cwhether the\nfacts, taken in the light most favorable to the party as~\nserting the injury\u2019... show the officers eonduet violated\na federal right.\u201d 1d. at 655-56 alterations adopted) (quo\ntation marks and citation omitted). Next, we must de-\ncide \u201cwhether the right in question was \u2018clearly estab-\nlished\u2019 at the time of the violation.\u201d dat 656 (quoting\nHope v, Pelzer, 536 U.S. 73, 739 (2002) To determine\nwhether a right is clearly established, we ask whether\nthe law on the date ofthe alleged misconduet gave the\ndefendant fair notice that their alleged misconduct was,\nunconstitutional. Hardigree, 922 F3d at 1224 (citing\nHope, 536 US. at TD,\n\nHere, itis undisputed that Guerra was aeting within\nhis discretionary authority, so the sole issue for our res-\nolution is whether his actions violated clearly estab-\nlished law.\n\n\u2018The Fourth Amendment, as applied to the states\nthrough the Fourteenth Amendment, protects individu-\nals from unreasonable searches of their property. Gen-\nznusa \u00a5. Canova, 748 P34 1108, 1109-10 (11th Cir. 2014).\n\u201c(A] Fourth Amendment search occurs \u2018when the\n\n18a\nAppendix A\n\ngovernment violates a subjective expectation of privacy\nthat society recognizes as reasonable.\" fd. at 1110(quot-\ning Kyo v.

Mar\n\u2018Vland \u00a5: Garrison, 480 US. 79,87 (1987), The officer is\nentitled to qualified immunity so long as he \u201cengage[d]\n\nreasonable offorts to avoid error\u201d Hartsfield\nLemacks, 50 F.3d 950, 955 (11th Cir. 1995). Thus, the\n\u201ctouchstone of the Fourth Amendment is reasonable-\nness.\" Ohio v Robinette, 519 U.S. 8, 39 (1986) (quota-\ntion marks omitted) (quoting Florida t: Jimeno, 500 U.S.\n248, 250 (1991) Reasonableness is measured \u201cby exam-\nining the totality of the circumstances.\u201d\n\nIn Hartsfield, we explained that an officer who\nmakes \u201creasonable effort{s} to ascertain and identify\nthe\u201d target address of a valid search warrant complies\nwith the Fourth Amendment even if error is ultimately\nnot averted. 50 Fd at 954-55 (quoting Garrison, 480\nU.S. at 88-89). Appellants contend that Guerra filed to\nmake reasonable efforts to identify 3741 Landau Lane\nbefore mistakenly executing the warrant at their house\nSpecifically, Appellants argue that Guerra did not con-\nduct a site survey or drive-by of 3741 Landau Lane prior\nto the warrant execution. Assuming Guerra failed to\nconduet a survey or pre-raid drive-by, the other actions\nhe took to identify 3741 Landau Lane were \u201cconsistent,\nwith a reasonable effort to ascertain and identify the\nplace intended to be searched.\u201d See Hartsfield, 50 Fd\nat 955 (quoting Garrison, 480 U.S. at 88-89). He re-\nviewed the operation order and SWAT addendum; he\n\n\nMa\nAppendix A\n\nattended an operational briefing that consisted of sev-\n\neral presentations displaying photographs of Riley and\n\n3741 Landau Lane; and he selected a staging area and,\n\n\u2018made tactical notes that considered the loeation and fea-\n\ntures of the target address,\n\nAdditionally, the faet that the target address and Ap-\npellants\u2019 house share several conspicuous features\ndemonstrates that Guerra\u2019s execution of the warrant at\nthe wrong house constituted an inadvertent mistake.\nBoth houses are beige in color, located on a corner lot,\nhave a large tree in the front, contain a stairwell to the\nfront door, are split-level, and have a side-entry garage\non a separate street that runs perpendicular to the front\ndoor: Further, Guerra and the SWAT team executed the\nwarrant while it was still dark outside and difficult to\nascertain the house numbers on the mailboxes. Guerra\nand the SWAT team had to enter a potentially danger-\nous situation to execute the warrant\u2014the home of a vi-\nTherefore, the decisions that\nin the rapidly-chang-\ning and dangerous situation of exeeuting a high-risk\nwarrant at night constitute the kind of reasonable mis-\ntakes that the Fourth Amendment contemplates. See,\neg, Heien v. North Carolina, 574 US. 54, 60-61 (2014)\n(To be reasonable is not to be perfect, and so the Fourth\nAmendment allows for some mistakes on the part of\ngovernment officials, giving them fair lee-way for en-\nforcing the law in the community's protection\u2019 (internal\nquotation marks and citation omitted); Willingham \u00a5.\nLoughnan, 321 F'3d 1299, 1308 (11th Cir. 2008) (\u201cOfficers\nfacing split-seeond decisions in dangerous or life-threat-\nening situations are seldom provided with fair warning,\n\n\n1a\nAppendix A\n\nnotice or guidance by a general requirement of reason-\nableness.\u201d).\n\nGuerra\u2019s preparatory steps before executing the\nwarrant complied with the FBIs standard prae-\ntices/procedures. The FBI affords its agents discretion\nin preparing for warrant executions: it has no official\npolicy or practice with respect to how agents are to lo-\ncate or navigate to the target address of a search war-\nrant, Additionally, while it is standard FBI practice to\nconduet a drive-by or site survey prior to executing a\nwarrant, those preparatory steps are fact-speeifie and\nleft to the agent's diseretion.\n\nIn sum, based on the facts and circumstances of this\ncase, we conclude that the law at the time did not clearly\nestablish that Guerra\u2019s preparatory steps before the\nwarrant exeeution would violate the Fourth Amend-\nment. Therefore, the district court did not err in grant\ning qualified immunity.\n\nB. The District Court Correctly Ruled that\nthe Supremacy Clause and the Discretion-\nary Function Exception Bar Appellants\u2019\nFTCA Claims.\n\nUnder the FTCA, a plaintiff may \u201cbring certain\nstate-law torts against\u201d the United States. Brownback\n\u00a5: King; 592 U.S. 209, 210 (2021). The FTCA waives the\nfederal government's sovereign immunity for the\nwrongful or negligent acts or omissions of its employees\nif a private person, under the same circumstances,\nwould be liable under the law of the state where the al-\nleged act or omission occurred. Swafford v. United\n\n\n1a\nAppendix A\n\n\u2018States, 839 Fd 1365, 1369 (11th Cir, 2016) (citing 28\nUS.C.\u00a7 2674).\n\nHowever, the FTCA exempts from liability state-\ntort claims arising from a government official's perfor-\nmance of a duty or function that involves discretion,\nShivers v. United States, 1 Fath 924, 928 (11th Cir.\n2021). \u2018The discretionary function exception to the\nFTCA\u2019 waiver of sovereign immunity exists to \u201cpre-\nvent judicial second guessing of ... administrative deei-\nsions.\u201d Jd. (quoting United States v. Gaubert, 499 US.\n2315, 328 (1991),\n\n\u2018To determine whether the diseretionary funetion ex-\nception applies in a given cireumstance, courts employ a\ntwo-factor test: they examine (1) whether the alleged\nact was diseretionary in nature meaning that the act \u201cin-\nvolved an element of judgment or choiee(;)\" and (2)\nwhether the act represented the kind of conduct \u201cthat\nthe diseretionary function exception was designed to\nshield.\u201d Swafford, 839 Fd at 1370 (first citing Berkovitz\nex rel, Berkovitz v. United States, 486 U.S. 531 (1988);\nand then citing Gaubert, 499 U.S. at 323). \u201cThe disere-\ntionary function exception applies unlessa source of fed-\neral law \u2018specifically prescribes\u2019 a course of conduct.\u201d\n\u2018Shivers, F.Ath at 981 (emphasis in original). The exeep-\ntion also applies irrespective of whether the government\nofficial abused his diseretion, Id. at 930 (quoting 28\nUS.C.\u00a7 2680(a),\n\nSimilar to the discretionary function exception, the\nSupremacy Clause ensures that states do not impede or\nburden the execution of federal law. Denson v. United\n\nVa\nAppendix A\n\nStates, 574 Fd 1818, 1836-7 (1th Cir. 2009). The gow-\nernment may invoke the Supremacy Clause against\nstate-tort liability if it demonstrates that the govern-\nment \u201cofficial's acts have some nexus with furthering\nfederal policy and can reasonably be characterized as\ncomplying with the full range of federal lav.\u201d Kordash,\n51 Fedth at 1293 (internal quotation marks and citations\nomitted). A government official\u2019 acts bear \u201csome nexus\nwith furthering federal policy\u201d if he acted within the\nscope of his discretionary authority. Id. at 1294. Simi-\nlarly, a government officials acts could \u201creasonably be\ncharacterized as complying with the fall range of federal\nJaw\u201d ifhis acts complied with the relevant constitutional\nstandard\u2014the Fourth Amendment. Id.\n\nWhen faced with the determination of whether the\nactions a law enforcement officer took comply with the\nFourth Amendment, courts employ an \u201cobjective rea-\nsonableness\u201d standard and consider whether \u201cthe facts\navailable to the officer at the moment of the seizure or\nthe search [make] a [person] of reasonable caution\nbelie(vel that the action taken was appropriate.\u201d Croom\nx. Balkwill, 645 F'3d 1240, 1249 (11th Cir. 2011) (quoting,\nTerry \u00a5. Ohio, 392.US,1, 21-22 (11th Cir, 1995).\n\nWe conclude that the diseretionary funetion exeep-\ntion bars Appellants\u2019 tort claims for trespass and inter-\nference with private property, negligent/intentional in-\nfliction of emotional distress, and negligence. The gov-\nernment has satisfied both elements of the dseretionary\nfunetion exception. With respect to the frst prong, the\nrecord\u2014viewed in the light most favorable to Appel-\nJants\u2014evinees that Guerra enjoyed discretion in how he\n\n18a\nAppendix A\n\nprepared for the warrant execution. As we previously\nexplained, the FBI did not have stringent policies or\nprocedures in place that dictate Aow agents are to pre-\npare for warrant exeeutions,\n\nFurthermore, the preparatory actions Guerra took\nbefore the warrant execution satisfy the second element\nof the diseretionary funetion exception test. In Mesa v\nUnited States, we explained that a federal officer\u2019s \u201cde-\ncision as to how to locate and identify the subject of an\narrest warrant prior to service of the warrant is suscep-\ntible to poliey analysis.\u201d 123 F:8d 1485, 1438 (11th Cin.\n1997). Although itis unfortunate that despite his prepar-\natory efforts, Guerra exeented the warrant at the wrong\nhouse, his actions, nevertheless, \u201cfall squarely within\nthe discretionary function exception.\u201d Shivers, 1 Fth at\n929,\n\n\u2018The Supremacy Clause bars Appellants\u2019 remaining\nFTCA claims for false imprisonment and assault and\nbattery. The district court initially denied summary\njudgment on Appellants\u2019 false imprisonment and assault,\nand battery claims on grounds that the discretionary\nfanetion exception could not defeat those claims be-\ncause under the FTCA\u2019 private person standard, Geor-\ngia\u2019s citizen's arrest statute does not contemplate the\ngood faith or reasonableness defenses that the govern-\nment asserted. However, on the government\u2019s motion\nfor reconsideration, the district court granted summary\njudgment on those claims, finding that our recent deci-\nsion in Kordash mandates dismissal of those claims.\n\n198\nAppendix A\n\nIn Kordash, we clarified that \u201cthe inquiry that deter-\n\u2018mines if the Supremacy Clause bars state-law liability is\nwhether a federal official's acts \u2018have some nexus with\nfurthering federal policy and ean reasonably be charae-\nterized as complying with the full range of {the Fourth\nAmendment)\u201d 51 Fath at 1283 (quoting Denson, 574\nF.3d at 1348). With respect to the first element, there is\nno doubt that Guerra acted within the seope of his dis-\nceretionary authority when he prepared for and exeeuted\nthe search warrant. The analysis we must conduct to ex-\namine whether Guerra complied with the full range of\nthe Fourth Amendment is the same as the inquiry we\nemployed in the qualified immunity analysis to deter-\nmine whether his actions violated the Fourth Amend-\nment, See id at 1294, As we already explained that\nGuerra\u2019s actions did not violate the Fourth Amendment,\nthe government has satisfied both elements of the Su:\npremacy Clause analysis. Accordingly, the Supremacy\nClause bars Appellants\u2019 FTCA claims for false impris-\nonment and assault and battery.\n\nIV. CONCLUSION\n\nFor the reasons set forth above, we AFFIRM the\ndistrict court's grant of summary judgment based on\nqualified\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

The target address\u2014which was report-\nedly the home of Jospeh [sie] Riley, a violent gang mem-\nber\u2014was located approximately a block away from Ap-\npellants\u2019 house and shared similar conspicuous features\nwith Appellants\u2019 house.\n\nAppellants initiated an action against the FBI agents\npursuant to Bivens x: Six Unknown Named Agents of\nFederal Bureau of Narcotics, 403 U.S. 388 (1971) and the\nUnited States under the Federal Tort Claims Act\nFTCA\u201d, alleging that the FBI agents violated their\nFourth Amendment rights and were also liable for dam-\nages under Georgia tort law. The district court granted\nsummary judgment in favor of the FBI agents and the\nUnited States.\n\nda\nAppendix A\nAfter careful review of the record and the parties\u2019\n\nbriefs, we affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary\n{judgment and dismissal of Appellants\u2019 claims.\n\nI. BACKGROUND\n\nOn October 18, 2017, during the predawn hours, a\nteam of six unidentified FBI agents\u2014ted by special\nagent, Lawrence Guerra\u2014exeeuted a presumably valid\nsearch warrant at 3756 Denville Trace, SW, Atlanta,\nGeorgia 80331, Appellants\u2019 home. The target location of\nthe search warrant was 3741 Landau Lane, SW, Atlanta,\nGeorgia 30381, which is located approximately three\nhouses away from Appellants\u2019 house. Despite taking\nseveral precautionary measures to ensure proper exe-\nceution of the search warrant, Guerra and the FBI agents\ninadvertently executed the search warrant at the wrong\nhouse.\n\nA. The FBI's Operation Red Tape\n\nIn 2015, the FBI initiated Operation Red Tape\u2014an\noperation concerning violent gang activity in Georgia.\n\u2018The Operation resulted in a criminal indictment and the\nissuance of arrest warrants for several individuals, in-\ncluding Riley. The FBT assigned Guerra to lead a Special\nWeapons and Tacties (\u201cSWAT\u201d) team that was tasked\nwith executing the arrest warrant for Riley at 8741 Lan-\ndan Lane,\n\nIn preparation for the warrant execution, the FBI\ncreated a general operation order and a SWAT adden-\ndum to the operation order: The SWAT addendum con-\ntained photographs of Riley, a description of his violent\n\nAppendix A\nhistory and gun possession, a photograph of 3741 Li\ndau Lane, SW, Atlanta, Georgia 30331, an overhead map\nimage of the neighborhood, and directions to 3741 Lan-\ndau Lane, Prior to the warrant execution, Guerra re-\nviewed a copy of the general operation order and the\nSWAT addendum.\n\nB. Pro-Execution Preparation\n\n\u2018The FBI has a standard operating procedure that its\nagents conduet a site survey or a drive-by prior to exe-\nceuting a high-risk warrant such as the one for Riley's ar-\nrest. However, the FBI does not have any policies gov-\ncerning how to locate or navigate to a target address nor\ndoes it prohibit using a personal GPS to locate a target\naddress.\n\nShortly before the warrant execution, Guerra and\nanother FBI agent, Gregory Donovan condueted a site\nsurvey of 8741 Landau Lane during daylight hours.\nThey used the Google Maps application on Donovan's\ncellphone to navigate to 8741 Landau Lane.\n\nDuring the site survey, Guerra took several photo-\ngraphs of 8741 Landau Lane, He also documented spe-\ncifie physical features of 3741 Landau Lane that he be-\nlieved were unique to the house, He noted that the house\nwas beige and split-level it was located on a corner lot;\nit had a side-entry garage on a separate street that ran\nperpendicular to the front door; it had a very large tree\nin the front yard; and the house number appeared on a\n\u2018small mailbox and not on the front of the house.\n\n\n6a\nAppendix A\n\nAfter Guerra completed the site survey, he identified\na staging area where the SWAT team would meet prior\nto the warrant execution. Additionally, he made tactical\nnotes of the order in whieh each SWAT team member\n\u2018would position themselves outside of 3741 Landau Lane\nand assigned tasks to each SWAT team member for the\nwarrant execution,\n\nIn addition to completing the site survey, Guerra at-\ntended an operational briefing regarding the warrant\nexecution, The briefing consisted of several presenta-\ntions that included photographs of Riley and 8741 Lan-\ndau Lane,\n\nOn the day of the warrant execution, Guerra and\nFBI special agent, Michael Lemoine, eondueted a pre-\nraid drive-by of 3741 Landau Lane. It was completely\ndark outside when they conducted the pre-raid drive-by.\nGuerra used his personal GPS deviee to navigate to 3741\nLandau Lane. Although he entered 3741 Landau Lane\ninto his GPS deviee, it directed him and Lemoine to 3756\nDenville Trace\u2014Appellants\u2019 house. Appellants\u2019 house is\napproximately 436 feet from 3741 Landau Lane. Alt-\nhough Appellants\u2019 house is located on Denville Trace, it\nfaces Landan Lane,\n\nGuerra believed he was at 8741 Landau Lane be-\ncause Appellants\u2019 house had many of the same features\nthat he noted for the target address during his site sur-\nvey. Similar to 8741 Landau Lane, Appellants\u2019 house\n\n\u00a2; it was located on the corner of the street; it\nwas split-level; it eontained a stairwell to the front door;\nthere was a very large tree in front of the house; it had\n\n\nTa\nAppendix A\n\na side-entry garage on a separate street that ran per-\n\npendicular to the front door; and the house number did\n\nnot appear anywhere on the house, but instead appeared\n\n\u2018on the mailbox. Although the mailbox is visible from the\n\nstreet, the house number is not.\n\nGuerra and Lemoine noticed a black Camaro in Ap-\npellants\u2019 driveway that Guerra did not recall seeing\nwhen he completed his site survey of 8741 Landau Lane\na few days earlier. They would later use the black Ca-\nmaro and a large tree as reference points when search-\ning for the target address for the warrant execution,\n\n. Search Warrant Execution\n\nAround 3:30 am. on the day of the warrant execu-\ntion, Guerra arrived at the staging area and briefed the\n\u2018SWAT team and officers from the Atlanta Police Depart-\nment (\u201cAPD\u201d). Guerra showed the SWAT team mem-\nbers photographs of 3741 Landau Lane and Riley, and\nhe briefed the agents on his tactical plan regarding the\nwarrant execution.\n\nFollowing the briefing and while it was still dark out-\nside, the SWAT team and APD officers\u2014led by\nGuerra\u2014headed towards the target address in a eara-\nvan of vehicles. When Guerra spotted the black Camaro,\nhe stopped his vehicle in front of Appellants\u2019 house, be-\nlieving that he was at 3741 Landau Lane, and the other\nvehicles followed suit. The SWAT team\u2014dressed in full\ntactical gear and armed with rifles and handguns\u2014\nquickly exited the vehicles and reported to their as-\nsigned! locations surrounding Appellants\u2019 house, Guerra\nKnocked and announced the presence of law\n\n8a\nAppendix A\n\nenforcement before an agent breached the front. door.\nAnother agent deployed a flashbang at the entrance of\nthe home. The SWAT team entered the house.\n\nWhen the SWAT team entered Appellants\u2019 house,\nCliatt\u2014afraid that their home was being burglarized\u2014\nrran towards the betlroom closet where he kept a shotgun\nfor protection. As Cliatt ran towards the bedroom\ncloset, Martin bolted towards the door to get her then\nseven-year-old son. However, Cliatt pulled Martin to-\nwards their bedroom closet, and the two hid in there,\n\nA SWAT team member located Cliatt and Martin in\ntheir bedroom closet, dragged Cliatt out of the closet\nand onto the bedroom floor with guns pointed at him,\nand handcuffed him, During the same time, Martin fell\nin the closet, and another SWAT team member pointed\ngun in her face while yelling at her to keep her hands\nup. No one handeuffed or touched Martin, Guerra en-\ntered the bedroom and realized that Cliatt did not have\nthe same face and neck tattoos that he observed in the\nphotographs of Riley, so he asked Cliatt for his name and\naddress, Cliatt provided Guerra with his name and ad-\ndress.\n\nWhile Guerra was in the bedroom questioning Cliatt,\nLemoine noticed a piece of mail that had a different ad-\ndress than 3741 Landau Lane and notified Guerra that\nthey were at the wrong address. Upon realizing that\nthey were at the wrong house, Guerra immediately\nended the raid: an agent lifted Cliat off the ground and\nuuneuffed him; Guerra told Cliatt that he would come\n\n\n9a\nAppendix A\n\nback later and explain what happened; and the agents\nleft the house.\n\nAfter leaving Appellants\u2019 house, Guerra and the\nSWAT team executed the search warrant at $741 Lan-\ndau Lane where they arrested Riley. After executing\nthe search warrant at the target address, Guerra re-\nturned to Appellants\u2019 house, apologized to them, docu-\nmented the damages caused by the mistaken raid, pro-\nvided them with the contact information for his supervi-\nsor, and advised them that the FBI would handle the\ndamage repairs.\n\nShortly after the mistaken raid at Appellants\u2019 house,\nGuerra reported the incident to the appropriate FBT\nrepresentative and completed an incident report.\nGuerra also stopped using his personal GPS for warrant\nexecutions and eventually threw it away.\n\nD. Lawsuit\n\nIn September 2019, Appellants brought a Bivens\nclaim against Guerra and the six unidentified FBI\nagents who participated in the raid, alleging that Guerra\nand the agents\u2019 mistaken execution of the search war-\nrant at their house violated their Fourth Amendment\nrights. They also brought state law claims for negli-\ngence, negligent/intentional infliction of emotional dis-\ntress, trespass and interference with private property,\nfalse arrest/false imprisonment, and assault and battery\nagainst the United States under the FTCA. Guerra and\nthe government moved for summary judgment on Ap-\npellants\u2019 claims.\n\n\nWa\nAppendix A\n\n\u2018The distriet court granted in part and denied in part\nthe motion for summary judgment. Specifically, the dis-\ntrict court granted summary judgment on Appellants\u2019\nBivens claim and state law elaims for negligenee, negli-\ngent infliction of emotional distress, and trespass. How-\never, the district court denied summary judgment on the\nfalse imprisonment and assault and battery claims,\n\nFollowing the distrit court's grant of partial sum-\nmary judgment, the parties filed eross motions for re-\nconsideration. The distriet court held that, given our re-\ncent decision in Kordash v: United States, 51 Fath 1289\n(Lith Cir. 2022), the Supremacy Clause defense barred\nAppellants\u2019 remaining FTCA tort claims.\n\n\u2018The district court entered judgment and Appellants\ntimely appealed.\n\nI STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\nWe review the district court\u2019s grant of summary\njudgment de novo, Holloman v. Mail- Well Corp, 443 F.3d\n\u2018S32, 836 (11th Cir. 2006), and denial of a motion for re-\nconsideration for abuse of discretion. Corwin v. Walt\nDisney Co., 475 F:3d 1239, 1254 (11th Cir, 2007). We also\nreview de novo the district court's qualified immunity\nanalysis. Hardigree s: Lofton, 992 F3d 1216, 1223 (11th\nCir. 2021).

Paramount Pietures Corp. 20 F454, 459 (11th\nCin. 1994). At the summary judgment stage, we con-\nstrue all facts and make all reasonable inferences in fa-\nvor of the non-moving party. Baxter, 54 Fath at 1253,\n(quoting Stryker \u00a5. City of Homewood, 978 F33d 769, 773\n(Lith Cir. 2020). However, we must only view the evi-\ndence in alight most favorable to the non-moving party\ntothe extent that the non-moving party's position is up-\nported by the record, Zd. Therefore, simply because\nsome alleged factual dispute exists between the parties\ndoes not mean summary judgment cannot be otherwise\ngranted. Scott\u00bb: Harris, 550 US. 372,380 2007).\n\nIIL DISCUSSION\n\nA, The District Court Properly Determined\nthat Qualified Immunity Protects Guerra\nfrom Suit.\n\nAppellants argue that Guerra is not entitled to qual-\nified immunity because his mistaken execution of the\nsearch warrant at their house was not a reasonable mis-\ntake and, therefore, his conduet violated the Fourth\nAmendment.\n\nQualified immunity protects government actors per-\nforming diseretionary functions from civil liability.\nAndujar v. Rodriquez, 486 Fd 1199, 1202 (11th Cin.\n2007) (quotation marks and citation omitted). Govern-\nment officials are entitled to qualified immunity unless\n\n1a\nAppendix A\n\ntheir conduct violates \u201cclearly established statutory or\n\nconstitutional rights of which a reasonable person would\n\nhave known.\u201d Merricks v, Adkisson, 785 F3d 553, 558\n\n(1th Cir. 2015) (quoting Harlow v.

Hardigree, 922 F3d at 1224 (citing\nHope, 536 US. at TD,\n\nHere, itis undisputed that Guerra was aeting within\nhis discretionary authority, so the sole issue for our res-\nolution is whether his actions violated clearly estab-\nlished law.\n\n\u2018The Fourth Amendment, as applied to the states\nthrough the Fourteenth Amendment, protects individu-\nals from unreasonable searches of their property.

The District Court Correctly Ruled that\nthe Supremacy Clause and the Discretion-\nary Function Exception Bar Appellants\u2019\nFTCA Claims.\n\nUnder the FTCA, a plaintiff may \u201cbring certain\nstate-law torts against\u201d the United States. Brownback\n\u00a5: King; 592 U.S. 209, 210 (2021). The FTCA waives the\nfederal government's sovereign immunity for the\nwrongful or negligent acts or omissions of its employees\nif a private person, under the same circumstances,\nwould be liable under the law of the state where the al-\nleged act or omission occurred.

United States, 1 Fath 924, 928 (11th Cir.\n2021). \u2018The discretionary function exception to the\nFTCA\u2019 waiver of sovereign immunity exists to \u201cpre-\nvent judicial second guessing of ... administrative deei-\nsions.\u201d Jd.

United States, 486 U.S. 531 (1988);\nand then citing Gaubert, 499 U.S. at 323). \u201cThe disere-\ntionary function exception applies unlessa source of fed-\neral law \u2018specifically prescribes\u2019 a course of conduct.\u201d\n\u2018Shivers, F.Ath at 981 (emphasis in original). The exeep-\ntion also applies irrespective of whether the government\nofficial abused his diseretion, Id. at 930 (quoting 28\nUS.C.\u00a7 2680(a),\n\nSimilar to the discretionary function exception, the\nSupremacy Clause ensures that states do not impede or\nburden the execution of federal law. Denson v. United\n\nVa\nAppendix A\n\nStates, 574 Fd 1818, 1836-7 (1th Cir. 2009). The gow-\nernment may invoke the Supremacy Clause against\nstate-tort liability if it demonstrates that the govern-\nment \u201cofficial's acts have some nexus with furthering\nfederal policy and can reasonably be characterized as\ncomplying with the full range of federal lav.\u201d Kordash,\n51 Fedth at 1293 (internal quotation marks and citations\nomitted). A government official\u2019 acts bear \u201csome nexus\nwith furthering federal policy\u201d if he acted within the\nscope of his discretionary authority. Id. at 1294. Simi-\nlarly, a government officials acts could \u201creasonably be\ncharacterized as complying with the fall range of federal\nJaw\u201d ifhis acts complied with the relevant constitutional\nstandard\u2014the Fourth Amendment. Id.\n\nWhen faced with the determination of whether the\nactions a law enforcement officer took comply with the\nFourth Amendment, courts employ an \u201cobjective rea-\nsonableness\u201d standard and consider whether \u201cthe facts\navailable to the officer at the moment of the seizure or\nthe search [make] a [person] of reasonable caution\nbelie(vel that the action taken was appropriate.\u201d Croom\nx.

Ohio, 392.US,1, 21-22 (11th Cir, 1995).\n\nWe conclude that the diseretionary funetion exeep-\ntion bars Appellants\u2019 tort claims for trespass and inter-\nference with private property, negligent/intentional in-\nfliction of emotional distress, and negligence. The gov-\nernment has satisfied both elements of the dseretionary\nfunetion exception. With respect to the frst prong, the\nrecord\u2014viewed in the light most favorable to Appel-\nJants\u2014evinees that Guerra enjoyed discretion in how he\n\n18a\nAppendix A\n\nprepared for the warrant execution. As we previously\nexplained, the FBI did not have stringent policies or\nprocedures in place that dictate Aow agents are to pre-\npare for warrant exeeutions,\n\nFurthermore, the preparatory actions Guerra took\nbefore the warrant execution satisfy the second element\nof the diseretionary funetion exception test. In Mesa v\nUnited States, we explained that a federal officer\u2019s \u201cde-\ncision as to how to locate and identify the subject of an\narrest warrant prior to service of the warrant is suscep-\ntible to poliey analysis.\u201d 123 F:8d 1485, 1438 (11th Cin.\n1997). Although itis unfortunate that despite his prepar-\natory efforts, Guerra exeented the warrant at the wrong\nhouse, his actions, nevertheless, \u201cfall squarely within\nthe discretionary function exception.\u201d Shivers, 1 Fth at\n929,\n\n\u2018The Supremacy Clause bars Appellants\u2019 remaining\nFTCA claims for false imprisonment and assault and\nbattery. The district court initially denied summary\njudgment on Appellants\u2019 false imprisonment and assault,\nand battery claims on grounds that the discretionary\nfanetion exception could not defeat those claims be-\ncause under the FTCA\u2019 private person standard, Geor-\ngia\u2019s citizen's arrest statute does not contemplate the\ngood faith or reasonableness defenses that the govern-\nment asserted. However, on the government\u2019s motion\nfor reconsideration, the district court granted summary\njudgment on those claims, finding that our recent deci-\nsion in Kordash mandates dismissal of those claims.\n\n198\nAppendix A\n\nIn Kordash, we clarified that \u201cthe inquiry that deter-\n\u2018mines if the Supremacy Clause bars state-law liability is\nwhether a federal official's acts \u2018have some nexus with\nfurthering federal policy and ean reasonably be charae-\nterized as complying with the full range of {the Fourth\nAmendment)\u201d 51 Fath at 1283 (quoting Denson, 574\nF.3d at 1348). With respect to the first element, there is\nno doubt that Guerra acted within the seope of his dis-\nceretionary authority when he prepared for and exeeuted\nthe search warrant. The analysis we must conduct to ex-\namine whether Guerra complied with the full range of\nthe Fourth Amendment is the same as the inquiry we\nemployed in the qualified immunity analysis to deter-\nmine whether his actions violated the Fourth Amend-\nment, See id at 1294, As we already explained that\nGuerra\u2019s actions did not violate the Fourth Amendment,\nthe government has satisfied both elements of the Su:\npremacy Clause analysis. Accordingly, the Supremacy\nClause bars Appellants\u2019 FTCA claims for false impris-\nonment and assault and battery.\n\nIV. CONCLUSION\n\nFor the reasons set forth above, we AFFIRM the\ndistrict court's grant of summary judgment based on\nqualified immunity in favor of Guerra and dismissal of\nthe FTCA claims against the United States on the\ngrounds that the Supremacy Clause and the diseretion-\nary fanetion exception bar those claims.\n\nAFFIRMED.\n\nAppendix B\n\nAppendix B\n\nOrder of the United States Distriet Court\nfor the Northern District of Georgia\n\nDecember 30, 2022\n\nala\nAppendix B\n\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nNORTHERN DISTRICT OF GEORGIA\n\nATLANTA DIVISION\nCURTRINA MARTIN\nPlaintiff,\n.

BACKGROUND\n\nPlaintiffs asserted claims against the United States\nunder the Federal Tort Claims Act (the \u201cFTCA\u201d) and\nagainst FBI Special Agent Lawrence Guerra (\u201cGuerra\u201d)\nunder the Fourth Amendment in connection with a war-\nrant that was inadvertently executed at Plaintiffs\u2019\nhome.\n\nOn September 23, 2022, the Court entered an order\ngranting summary judgment to the United States and\nGuerra on Counts III, IV, V and VI of the complaints\nand denying summary judgment as to Counts I and IT\nOrder\u201d), As set forth in the Order, Guerra was dis-\nmissed from the aetion on qualified immunity grounds,\nand certain FTCA claims against the United States re-\nmained.\n\n\u2018The United States seeks reconsideration of the Or-\nder on two grounds. First, it argues that the Eleventh\nCireuit Court of Appeals\u2019 opinion in Kordash v. United\n\u2018States, 51 F.Ath 1289 (11th Cir. 2022), which was issued\napproximately one month after this Court issued its Or-\nder, is an intervening development in controlling law\nthat requires dismissal of Plaintifis\u2019 FTCA claims, Sec-\nond, the United States contends that the Court\n\n\u2018urtrina Martin and her child filed a joint complaint, and Hin\n(Catt filed separately. The eases are now consolidated.\n\n2a\nAppendix B\n\nincorrectly declined to apply certain privileges and im-\n\u2018munities against Plaintiffs\u2019 FTCA claims.\n\nPlaintiffs also seek reconsideration of the Court\u2019s Or-\nder. They assert that the Court misunderstood and\nerred in its assessment of their spoliation argument re-\nlating toa GPS unit Guerra destroyed after the incident.\n\nI. ANALYSIS\n\n\u201cCourts may grant relief under . . . Local Rule 72E\nonly if the moving party clears a high hurdle.\u201d Chesnut\n\ny. Ethan Allen Retail, Inc, 17 \u00a5. Supp. 3d 1367, 1370\n(N.D. Ga, 2014), Indeed, Local Rule 7.2(8) dictates that\n\u201c(motions for reconsideration shall not be filed as a mat-\nter of routine practice\u201d and may be filed only when \u201cab-\nsolutely necessary.\u201d \u201cReeonsiderationis only \u2018absolutely\nnecessary\u2019 where there is: (1) newly discovered evi-\ndence; (2) an intervening development or change in con-\ntrolling lav; or (3) a need to correct a clear error of law\nor fact.\u201d Bryan v. Murphy, 246 F. Supp. 2d 1256, 1259\n(ND. Ga. 2008).\n\n\u2018Thus, Local Rule 72E does not afford a dissatisfied\nparty \u201can opportunity to relitigate old matters, raise ar-\ngument or present evidence that could have been raised\nprior to the entry of {the order}, introduce novel legal\ntheories, or repackage familiar arguments to test\nwhether the Court will change its mind.\u201d Chesnut, 7 F.\nSupp. 3d at 1370. In other words, a motion for reconsid-\neration is not \u201can opportunity to show the court how it\n\u201ccould have done it better.\u201d Bryan, 246 F. Supp. 2d at\n1259 (quoting Pres. Endangered Areas of Cobb's\n\n\n2a\nAppendix B\n\nHistory, Ine. v. U.S. Army Corps of Eng\u2019rs, 916 F.Supp.\n1557, 1560 (N.D. Ga. 1995).\n\n1, Whether the opinion in Kordash is a\ndevelopment in controlling law that\nrequires dismissal of Plaintiffs\u2019 re-\nmaining FTCA claims\n\n\u2018The United States argues that the Kordash opinion,\nwhich was entered after the Court issued its Order in\nthis ease, is relevant to the question of whether the Su-\npremacy Clause of the United States Constitution bars\nPlaintiffs\u2019 state law claims brought pursuant to the\nFTCA. The United States urges the Court to find that\nit does.\n\nPlaintiffs challenge whether the United States has\ncarried its burden for reconsideration on this ground.\nThey assert that the argument for dismissal of the\nFTCA claims under the Supremacy Clause is not a new\ndevelopment in the law and is rather a \u201cstraightforward\napplication\u201d of the Eleventh Cireuit\u2019s opinion in Denson\nv. United States, 574 F.3d 1318 (11th Cir. 2009), which\nwas entered more than a decade ago. AS support for\ntheir position, Plaintifts point to the Eleventh Circuit's,\nstatement in Kordash that \u201cthe only difference between\nDenson and [Kordash] is that [the plaintiff in Kordash]\nsplit his claims into two lawsuits instead of joining them\ninto one.\u201d Kordlash, 51 F.Ath at 1294. In short, Plaintifts\nmaintain that the United States had an opportunity to\nraise the Supremaey Clause argument sooner but failed\nto do so, and it eannot offer an argument for the first\ntime in its motion for reconsideration.\n\n\n2a\nAppendix B\n\nIn response, the United States argues that the Kor-\ndash opinion represents an intervening development be-\ncause unlike in Denson, the Eleventh Cireuit directly\nstated in Kordash that the first prong of the test to de-\ntermine if the Supremacy Clause applies is satisfied by\nfinding that the official was aeting within the seope of\nhis discretionary authority. The United States also con-\ntends that it could not have raised its Supremacy Clause\nargument sooner or waived it because the argument did\nnot become ripe until the Court granted qualified im-\nmunity to Guerra,\n\n\u2018The Court acknowledges that the United States\ncould have possibly raised its Supremacy Clause argu-\nment earlier. However, Denson is not direetly on point\nhere, and the Kordash opinion does brings [sic] addi-\ntional clarity to the question of whether the Supremacy\nClause bars the FTCA claims under the cireumstances\nof this case, As such, the Court finds that this develop-\n\u2018ment in controlling law warrants reconsideration of the\nOrder.\n\nWith respect to the substantive question of whether\nPlaintiffs\u2019 FTCA claims are barred by the Supremacy\nClause, the Court must decide whether (i) Guerra\u2019s ac-\ntions had \u201csome nexus with furthering federal poliey\";\nand (i) his actions \u201ccan reasonably be characterized as\ncomplying with the full range of federal law.\u201d Kordash,\n51 FAth at 1298 (citation omitted). \u201cIf the answer to\nthese questions is yes, application of state law, to the ex-\ntent it unavoidably conflicts with federal law, has no ef-\nfect, as it would frustrate and impede the compelling\n\n26a\n\nAppendix B\nfederal interest of allowing federal officers to effectively\ndischarge their duties.\u201d Denson, 574 F.3d at 1348,\n\nAccording to the opinion in Kordash, the first prong.\nof the analysis is satisfied ifthe official was acting within\nthe seope of his discretionary duty. See Kordash, 51\nFath at 1294, The second prong is satisfied if the offi-\ncial\u2019s actions are found to have complied with the appli-\ncable constitutional standard. See id. These conclusions\ncan be derived from a qualified immunity analysis. See\nid.\n\nHere, the first prong of the Supremaey Clause anal-\nysis is satisfied because, as set forth in the qualified im-\n\u2018munity diseussion of the Court\u2019s Order, Plaintiffs do not\ndispute that Guerra was acting within the seope of his\ndiseretionary authority.\n\nPlaintiffs, however, dispute that the second prong of\nthe testis satisfied.\" They contend that the Court did not\nconclude that Guerra complied with the requirements of\nthe Fourth Amendment because the Court's Order was\nbased only on the second prong of the qualified immun-\nity test, Ze,, whether Guerra violated clearly established\nlaw.\n\nPlaintiffs devive e three-part test from the Kordash opinion, in-\ncluding a requirement that the oficial \u201cacted consstentiy with\npreeminent federal interests of protecting our international bor\n\u2018lers.\" This formulation of the requisite analysis is ineorret and not\n\u2018supported by the Kordashand Denson opinions, The Courts analy\nsisrelies on the two-prong test deseribed in those opinions and eval-\ntates Plaintiff\u2019 arguments as they relate to those prongs\n\n\na\nAppendix B\n\nPlaintiffs are correct that the Court\u2019s conclusion was\nbased on the second prong of the qualified immunity\ntest. The Court found that the law was not clearly estab-\nlished at the time of the incident sueh that Guerra would\nhave known that his actions in this case would be\ndeemed unreasonable and violative of the law.\n\nIn the process of reaching that conclusion, however,\nthe Court expressly considered whether Guerra's ac-\ntions violated the Fourth Amendment. Noting that the\n\u201cultimate touchstone of the Fourth Amendment is rea-\nsonableness,\u201d the Court condueted an extensive analy-\nsis of relevant cases as compared to the facts of this ease\nand ultimately found that Guerra\u2019s actions \u201cwere rea-\nsonable under the circumstances.\u201d ECF No, 124 at 21\n\u2018The Court emphasized that Guerra's mistake is not a ba~\nsis to find that he acted unreasonably and in violation of\nthe law. The Court also cited several eases where courts\nhave granted qualified immunity in similar cireum-\nstanees. In all, even though the Court's Order did not\nrest on the first prong of the qualified immunity test\n(whether Guerra violated the Fourth Amendment), the\nCourt explicitly considered this question and found that\nGuerra did not violate the law.\n\nBecause Guerra was acting within the scope of his\ndiseretionary duty, and his actions did not violate the\nFourth Amendment, both prongs of the Supremacy\nClause analysis are satisfied. Accordingly, the Suprem-\nacy Clause bars Plaintiffs\u2019 state law elaims brought pur-\nsuant to the FTCA, and Counts I and IT of the com-\nplaints are dismissed.\n\n28a\nAppendix B\n\nWhether the Court correctly de-\n\nclined to apply certain privileges and\n\nimmunities against Plaintiffs\u2019 FTCA\n\nclaims\n\n\u2018The United States contends that the Court\u2019s rejee-\ntion of certain state law defenses to the FTCA laims\nimproperly creates a strict liability standard for FTCA\nclaims. However, this argument is not based on any of\nthe allowable grounds for reconsideration, It does not\npoint to new evidence, clear error or an intervening\nchange in law. To the contrary, the United States\u2019 dis-\ncussion ofthe issue reflects mere disagreement with the\nCourt\u2019s conclusion and simply repackages and extends\nalready rejected arguments to see if the Court will\nchange its mind. Accordingly, reconsideration of this\npoint is not warranted.\u201d\n\n3. Whether the Court Misunderstood\nPlaintiffs\u2019 Spoliation Argument\n\nSection IMC) of Plaintiffs\u2019 brief in opposition to\nsummary judgment is titled \u201cSpoilation [sic].\u201d This sec-\ntion of the brief cites the legal standard for spoliation\nand discusses whether a reasonable faetfinder eould eon-\nclude that Guerra intentionally destroyed the GPS unit\n\u2018on which he states he relied to identify the subject home.\nAs part of this discussion, Plaintiffs explained that they\n\u201chave not yet moved for spoliation sanctions against De~\nfendants because . .. the eritieal question for imposing\n\nIn any event, the United States\u2019 argument is moot given the\nCourts dismistal of the FTCA claims on Supremacy Clause\nrounds\n\n2a\nAppendix B\n\nsanetions is a factual one for the faetfinder.\u201d ECF No.\n101 at 81 n.18, Plaintiffs farther \u201cpropose(d] that [the\nspoliation] question be posed to the jury via special in-\nterrogatory (if proceeding via jury trial for the Bivens\nclaim) or to the Court (in a FTCA trial)\u201d J In light of\nPlaintiffs\u2019 assertions, the Court noted in its Order that\nit did not \u201caddress the arguments in the \u2018Spoliation\u2019 sec-\ntion of Plaintiffs\u2019 response brief because, as Defendants\npoint out, Plaintiffs do not request any specifie relief.\u201d\nECF No. 124 at 37 n.16,\n\nPlaintiffs seize on this footnote to argue that the\nCourt did not consider their argument that Guerra\u2019s\nqualified immunity defense should be rejected because\nhe intentionally destroyed the GPS unit.\n\nAs shown above, Plaintiffs did not argue that Guerra\nshould be denied qualified immunity simply based on\nspoliation of evidence. Plaintiffs deseribed their argu-\n\u2018ment opposing Guerra\u2019s qualified immunity defense as\nfollows:\n\nFactual issues preclude summary judgment of\nPlaintiffs\u2019 Bivens claim because a jury could find\nGuerra did not engage in any reasonable or mean-\ningful effort to lead the SWAT team to the correct\nhouse beeause he did not do the\n\ndrive-by as he claimed that he did, And Defend-\nant Guerra engaged in spoliation of key evidence\nthat deserves sanetions,\n\nECF No. 101 at 15.\n\n30a\nAppendix B\n\n\u2018The GPS unit was mentioned in Plaintiffs\u2019 briefin the\ncontext of their argument that ifthe unit were available,\nit would show that Guerra did not conduct the Site Sur-\nvey and Drive-by of the location as he asserts and that\nhis preparation to serve the warrant was therefore not\nreasonable. See id. at 15-16. Plaintiffs concluded that the\nquestion of whether Guerra completed these tasks ere-\nated a genuine issue of material fact barring summary\njudgment. See id.\n\n\u2018The Court\u2019s Order specifically addresses this argu-\n\u2018ment and applies an inference that Guerra did not con-\nduet the Site Survey and Drive-by. For example, the\nCourt stated\n\nHere, the Court has reservations regarding\nwhether Plaintiffs\u2019 argument that Guerra failed\nto complete the Site Survey and the Drive-By\npresents a genuine dispute of the facts. The evi-\ndence Plaintiffs offer in support of their conten-\ntion requires inferential leaps that are not neces-\nsarily supported by the record,\n\n\u2018To survive summary judgment, Plaintiffs must do\nmore than raise metaphysical doubt regarding\nthe facts, They must produce substantial evi-\ndence demonstrating that there is a genuine issue\nof material fact.\n\nsla\nAppendix B\n\nEven if, for argument\u2019s sake, the Court eredits\nPlaintiffs\u2019 argument that Guerra did not eonduet\nthe Site Survey and the Drive-By, the record con-\ntains undisputed evidence of several other steps\nthat Guerra took to ascertain and identify the\nhome deseribed in the warrant... These steps\nconstitute considerably more than nothing.\n\u2018The Court considers Guerra\u2019s overall preplanning.\nto constitute significant precautionary measures\nto avoid mistake. The Court further finds that\nthose measures were reasonable under the eir-\ncumstances.\n\nECF No. 124 at 20-21 (citations and quotation marks\nomitted).\n\nInsum, the Court acknowledged and contended with\nthe consequence of the unavailable GPS data and still\nfound that Guerra was entitled to qualified immunity.\nThe only issue the Court did not address is whether\nsanetions should issue for Guerra's destruction of the de-\nvvice\u2014an issue that Plaintiffs, themselves, deferred for a\nlater date,\n\nLike the United States\u2019 argument in section 112)\nabove, Plaintiffs\u2019 argument here appears to be an at-\ntempt to relitigate the underlying conclusion of the\nCourt's Order with the hope that the Court will rule dif-\nferently. That is not a proper basis for a motion for re~\nconsideration. Consequently, Plaintiffs\u2019 Motion is de-\nnied,\n\n82a\nAppendix B\nIl. CONCLUSION\n\nIn accordance with the Court's analysis herein, the\nCourt GRANTS the United States\u2019 Motion (ECF No.\n188) and DENIES Plaintiffs\u2019 Motion (ECF No. 134). As\na result, Counts I and IT of Plaintiffs\u2019 complaints are\nDISMISSED.

For example, the Operation Order pro-\nvided that seven search warrants and seventeen arrest\nwarrants, including warrants for Riley\u2019s arrest and the\nsearch of his home located at 3741 Landau Lane SW, At-\nJanta, Georgia (\u201c3741 Landau\u201d), would be executed sim-\nultaneously on October 18, 2017, at 6:00 a.m,\n\n\u2018The FBI also prepared a SWAT Addendum to the\nOperation Order, which described SWAT-specific\n\n* Curtrina Martin and her child filed a joint complaint, and Hind\nCatt filed separately. The eases are now consolidated.\n\n\n36a\n\nAppendix C\ntactical considerations. The SWAT Addendum in-\nstructed the teams to achieve a near simultaneous exe-\ncution of the warrants to ensure surprise and ineluded\ninformation specifi to the SWAT team, such as breach-\ning the front door and deploying flash bangs.\n\nBasedl on the FBI's determination that Riley posed a\nhigh risk of violence, a SWAT team was designated to\nenter Riley\u2019s home and secure it for other FBI personnel\nto execute the warrants. The SWAT Addendum for 3741\nLandau and Riley included a deseription and photograph\nof the home; an overhead image of the neighborhood\nwith a pin denoting 3741 Landau; step-by-step diree-\ntions to the property with a corresponding map; photo-\ngraphs of Riley; Riley\u2019s physical deseription; and infor-\nmation regarding Riley's alleged history of violence and\ngun possession.\u201d\n\nGuerra was assigned to lead the SWAT Team that\nwould execute the warrants at 3741 Landau, He re-\nceived the names of his SWAT team members as well as\nthe Operation Order and SWAT Addendum.\n\nTo prepare for the warrant exeeutions at 8741 Lan-\ndan, Guerra testified that he conducted a site survey of\n3741 Landau in October 2017 (the \u201cSite Survey\u201d). As\npart of the Site Survey, Guerra states that he noted that\n\nSome of the information inthe SWAT Addendum was gathered by\nFBI Task Force Officer Joshua Thompson (\"Thompson\") during his\nsurvellane of $741 Landan for more than to hours on Oetober 3,\n2021. In addition to diving by the home and dsereetly taking pho-\ntographs of it, Thompson observed the home from aside street us-\ning binoculars\n\n\nSta\nAppendix C\n\nthe residence was a beige split-level home located on a\n\ncorner lot with a large tree; it had a tight stairway and\n\nstoop leading to the front door; and it had windows on\n\neither side that would make taetical entry difficult and\n\nleave agents vulnerable in case of gunfire.\n\nGuerra states that after conducting the Site Survey,\nhe identified a nearby parking lot to be used as a staging\narea for the team executing the 3741 Landau warrants,\nGuerra communicated the location of the staging area to\nthe team via email on October 16, 2017. Guerra also\nwrote tactical notes, which specified the \u201cstack\u201d for-\nmation or order in whieh SWAT team members would\nposition themselves outside the front door and who\nwould breach the door, carry a shield and go upstairs or\ndownstairs upon entry.\n\nOn October 17, 2017, Guerra attended a briefing re-\ngarding the operation, which included a presentation on\nthe warrants to be served on Riley and executed at 3741\nLandau the next day.\n\nGuerra and FBI Special Agent Michael Lemoine\n(\u201cLemoine\u201d) testified that at approximately 3:30 a.m, on\nOctober 18, 2017 (the morning the warrants were to be\nserved), they traveled to 3741 Landau to determine\nwhether any unexpected conditions existed atthe target\nthat could impact the operation (the \u201cDrive-By\u201d). Such\nconditions ineluded evidence that the occupants were\nawake. Guerra testified that it was dark outside, and he\ndimmed his vehicle's headlights to avoid detection, He\nstated that the personal GPS deviee that he used for\nnavigation led him to a home he believed was 8741\n\n\n38a\n\nAppendix C\nLandau, At that home, Guerra testified that he observed\na tan split-level home on a comer lot with a large tree,\nwhich he recalled from his Site Survey. Guerra reported\nthat he noticed the street sign for Landau Lane, a gar-\nage at the side of the home, a stoop in front of the home\nand four windows to the right of the stoop. Guerra and\nLemoine both testified that they observed a black Ca-\nmaro car in the driveway of the home, which Guerra\nnoted as a future reference point. Lemoine and Guerra\ndiscussed that the black Camaro ear was not present at\nthe home during Guerra's previous visit.\u2019\n\nItturns out that Guerra and Lemoine were at Plain-\ntiff\u201d home, located at 3756 Denville Trace SW, Atlanta,\nGeorgia (\"3756 Denville\u201d), instead of at 3741 Landau.\nPlaintiff\u2019 home, which also faces Landau Lane, is three\nor four houses down from 8741 Landau. The address of\n\u00a38756 Denville is not affixed to the front of the home or\nanywhere else on the building, It is posted on the mail-\nbox at the end of the driveway on the side of the house\nlocated on Denville Trace.\n\nGuerra testified that he and Lemoine subsequently\nreturned to the staging area to brief the other personnel\nparticipating in the operation. Shortly before 5:00 a.m.,\n\u2018a caravan of federal agents and Atlanta Police Depart-\nment officers left the staging area for 3741 Landau. It\n\u2018was still dark outside, When Guerra arrived at the home\nhe believed to be 3741 Landau, he directed the driver of\nhis vehicle to stop. Guerra was at 3756 Denville, but\n\n\"Riley was not known to operate a black Camaro ear or aesoeate\nwith anyone who di. The SWAT Addendum lsted several other\n\u2018vehicles as associated with Riley, inetudinga white Nissan ear\n\n39a\nAppendix C\n\nneither he nor the other agents realized the error at that\ntime.\n\nOnce the SWAT Team was in place, Guerra states\nthat he knoeked on the door and announced law enforee-\n\u2018ments presence. Plaintiffs were asleep in their bedroom\nand stated that they did not hear the knock. After wait-\ning ten to twenty seconds, Guerra directed an agent to\nbreach the front door. Another agent deployed a flash\nbang. The team entered Plaintiffs\u2019 home at or about 5:00\n\nPlaintiffs hid in their bedroom closet after the agents\nentered the home but were quickly found. The agents\nremoved Cliatt from the closet, dragged him to the bed-\nroom floor and handcuffed him. No agent touched Mar-\ntin,\n\nShortly after agents detained Cliatt, Guerra entered\nthe bedroom and noticed that Cliatt did not have the\nsame tattoos as Riley. Guerra then asked Cliatt to pro-\nvide his name and address. Around that time, Lemoine\nnoticed mail bearing a different address than 3741 Lan-\ndau, Upon realizing that they were in the wrong home,\nthe agents ended the search and uncuffed Cliatt. Guerra\ntold Plaintiffs he would return to explain what hap-\npened. The agents were in the home for no more than\nfive minutes.\n\nAt or about 5:07 a.m., Guerra and the team executed\nthe warrants at 741 Landau, Guerra thereafter re-\nturned to Plaintiffs\u2019 home and apologized for the error.\nHe provided his business card and took photographs of\nthe damage caused by the foreed entry. Guerra also\n\n\n0a,\nAppendix C\n\nprovided the name of the FBI's Chief Division Counsel\nwho would be responsible for the incident.\n\nGuerra testified that he stopped using his personal\nGPS device after the incident, and he threw it away not\nJong after that. The device was therefore not available\nfor Plaintiffs\u2019 inspection during discovery or for corrob-\noration of Guerra's testimony.\n\n\u2018The FBI\u2019sagency representative testified that when\npreparing to execute a gang-related warrant, an FBI\nagent typically conducts a site survey of the target loca-\ntion to the extent feasible. However, no FBI poliey or\nprocedure dictates how to locate or navigate to the tar-\nget, whether to use a GPS device or what type of GPS\ndevice must be used, whether or how to eonduet a site\nsurvey or drive-by of a target location or how long to\nwait before entering after knocking and announcing.\n\u2018These decisions are left to the personnel involved in the\nspecific operation,\n\nPlaintiffs dispute several facts relating to Guerra\u2019s\npreparation to serve and execute the warrants. They as-\nsert that the absence of corroborating geo location and\nmeta data raises questions regarding the veracity of\nGuerra's testimony that he completed the Site Survey\nand the Drive-By. Specifically, Plaintiffs challenge that:\n( GPS data is not available for Guerra's device at the\ntime he states he completed the Site Survey and the\nDrive-By but is available for the hours following the ex-\necution of the warrants; (i) available geo location data\nfor Lemoine\u2019s device ealls into question whether he par-\nticipated in the Drive-By; (ii) no metadata is available\n\nAla\nAppendix C\n\nfor the photographs that Guerra asserts he took of 8741\nLandau during his Site Survey; (iv) Guerra and FBI\nAgent Gregory Donovan (\u201cDonovan\u201d) initially testified\nthat they condueted the Site Survey together, but geo\nlocation data from Donovan's cellular telephone indi-\ncates that he did not visit 3741 Landau during the rele-\nvant period; and (v) Guerra disposed of his personal GPS\ndevice after the incident, even though he gave Plaintiffs\nthe contact information for the Chief Division Counsel\nand should have anticipated that there could be litiga-\ntion regarding the incident. Plaintiffs conclude that a\nreasonable juror could determine, based on these facts,\nthat Guerra did not conduet the Site Survey or Drive-\nBy prior to executing the warrants.\n\nDefendants respond that Guerra's testimony regard-\ning the Site Survey and Drive-By is corroborated by\nphotographs of the home that only Guerra testified to\nhhave taken; an October 16, 2017 e-mail from Guerra to\nthe team identifying the staging area, which Guerra as-\nserts he identified as part of the Site Survey; and\nGuerra\u2019s tactical notes written prior to the execution of,\nthe warrant and reportedly based on the Site Survey.\n\nDefendants further explain that the FBI was unable\nto find geo location data for seven of the sixteen FBI\npersonnel who participated in the warrant executions\nand that there is no evidence that such data was de-\nstroyed or withheld from Plaintiffs. Defendants also ar-\ngue that geo location data that is available for Lemoine\u2019s\ndevice shows that he arrived at the staging area at ap-\nproximately 3:26 a.m. on the morning of October 17 and\nthat he left the staging area between 3:31 a.m. and 3:42\n\nBa\n\nAppendix C\nam., which would have been sufficient time for Guerra\nand Lemoine to complete the Drive-By and return to the\nstaging area.\n\nAdditionally, Defendants assert that Guerra exe-\ncuted the declaration in this ease more than two years\nafter the Site Survey, and at that time, both he and Do-\nnovan believed that they had conducted the Site Survey\ntogether in accordance with their common practice, De-\nfendants explain that after they learned that geo loca-\ntion data indicated that Donovan was not present at the\nSite Survey, both agents corrected the declaration tes-\ntimony during their depositions,\n\nDefendants also contend that FBI policy did not re-\nquire Guerra to preserve his personal GPS unit, and the\nobligation to preserve the unit materialized only when\nthe unit became diseoverable in litigation. Defendants\n\u2018maintain that Guerra provided the Chief Division Coun-\nsel\u2019s contact information to Plaintiffs to facilitate reim-\nbbursement for the damage to Plaintiffs\u2019 home and not\nbecause Guerra believed litigation would arise from the\nincident.\n\nI. ANALYSIS\nA. Legal Standard\n\u201cSummary judgment is appropriate when the record\n\nevidence, including depositions, sworn declarations, and\nother materials, shows that there is no genuine dispute\n\n\u201cThe record does not show where Lemoine went, and data is not\navailable for his device between 243 am. and 4:8 am.\n\n48a\nAppendix C\n\nfas to any material fact and the movant is entitled to\njudgment as a matter of law.\" Feliciano v. City of Miami\n\u2018Beach, 107 F.3d 1244, 1247 (11th Cir. 2018) (quoting Fed.\nR. Civ. P. 56) (quotation marks omitted).

Ultimately, \u201c{t]he\nbasie issue before the court... is \u2018whether the evidence\npresents a sufficient disagreement to require submis-\nsion to a jury or whether it is so one-sided that one party\n\u2018must prevail as a matter of law.\u201d Allen, 121 F.3d at 646\ncitation omitted).\n\n\u2018The party moving for summary judgment bears the\ninitial burden of showing that no geniuine issue exists as\nto any material fact. See id. \u201cin deciding whether the\nmovant has met this burden(,] the court must view the\nmovant\u2019s evidence and all factual inferences arising from\nit in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.\u201d\nMd.\n\nAfter the movant satisfies this initial burden, the\nnonmovant bears the burden of showing specific facts in-\ndicating summary judgment is improper because a ma~\nterial issue of fact does exist.

Qualified Immunity\n\n\u2018The doctrine of qualified immunity protects govern-\n\u2018ment officials from civil liability for actions taken within\nthe scope of their discretionary authority unless their\nconduet violated a plaintiff's federal constitutional\nrights as demonstrated by clearly established law. See\nHarbert Int, Ine. v. James, 151 F.3d 1271, 1281 (11th\nCir. 1998). \u201cThe defense of qualified immunity aims to\nstrike a balance between \u2018the need to hold publi officials\naccountable when they exercise power irresponsibly\nand the need to shield officials from harassment, distrac-\ntion, and liability when they perform their duties rea-\nsonably.\u201d Taylor v. Taylor, 649 F. App\u2019s 731, 742 (11th\nCir. 2016), Thus, the doctrine \u201cgives government off-\ncials breathing room to make reasonable but mistaken\njudgments, and \u2018protects all but the plainly incompetent,\nor those who knowingly violate the law.\u201d\n\n\n45a\nAppendix C\n\nMesserschmidt v. Millender, 65 U.S. 585, 546 (2012)\n(quoting Asheroftv. al-Kidd, 563 U.S. 731, 748 2011).\n\n\u2018The burden is on the defendant to raise the qualified\nimmunity defense. See Lewis v. City of W. Palm Beach,\n561 F.3d 1288, 1201 (11th Cir. 2009). Once the defendant\ndoes so, the burden shifts to the plaintiff to show that\nqualified immunity should not apply. See id.\n\nCourts in the Eleventh Cireuit \u201cconduet a two-step\ninquiry to decide whether qualified immunity should be\ngranted: (1) taken in the light most favorable to the\nparty asserting the injury, do the facts alleged show the\nofficer's conduct violated a constitutional right{?]; and\n)if'a constitutional right would have been violated wn-\nder the plaintif?'s version of the facts, ... [was] the right\n=. clearly established(?)\" Shuford v. Conway, 666 F.\nApp'x 811, 815 (11th Cir. 2016),\n\n\u201cBoth elements must be satisfied for an official to\nlose qualified immunity.\u201d Fis v. City of Aventura, 647\nF.3d 1272, 1287 (11th Gir. 2011) (tation omitted). How-\never, \u201cthe two steps do not have to be analyzed sequen-\ntially.\u201d Za. If the law was not clearly established at the\ntime ofthe incident, the court need not decide ifthe de-\nfendant actually violated the plaintiff's rights. See id;\nMaughon v. City of Covington, 505 F. App's 818, 821\n(Lith Gir. 2013) (stating that \u201cthe court] need not con-\nduct {the} qualified immunity analysis in any specific o-\nder; rather, (the court is} permitted to exercise [its]\nsound diseretion in deciding which prong of [the] inquiry\ntoaddress first\u201d),\n\n\n6a\n\nAppendix C\n\nWith these principles in mind, the Court turns to the\nsubstance of Plaintiffs\u2019 Fourth Amendment claim\nagainst Guerra.\n\nDefendants contend that Plaintis\u2019 Fourth Amend-\n\u2018ment claims should be dismissed on qualified immunity\ngrounds because Guerra was acting within the seope of\nhis discretionary authority, and Plaintiffs have failed to\nshow that the alleged constitutional right was clearly es-\ntablished at the time of the incident. Since Plaintfis do\nnot dispute that Guerra was acting within the scope of\nhis diseretionary authority,\u201d the burden shifts to Plain-\ntiffs to show that qualified immunity is inappropriate\nhere. See Lewis, 561 F.3d at 1291, To evaluate whether\nPlaintiffs have satisfied their burden in this regard, the\nCourt turns first to the second prong of the qualified im-\nmunity test (clearly established law).\n\nEven where an officer is found to have violated a\nplaintiff's Fourth Amendment right, the doctrine of\n\u2018qualified immunity bars recovery unless the plaintiff ean\nshow that the violated right was clearly established at\nthe time of the incident. See Smith v. LePage, SU F.3d\n1285, 1297 (11th Cir. 2016). Thus, the plaintiff must show\nthat at the time ofthe officer's conduct, the law was clear\nsuch that every reasonable official would have under-\nstood that the conduct would be unlawful under the eir-\ncumstances. See District of Columbia v. Weshy, 138 S.\nCt. 577, 589 (2018). In other words, \u201cexisting law must\nhave placed the constitutionality of the officer's conduct\n\n\u2018The only diseussion of discretion in Paint brief relates to thelr\nangument that the discretionary function exception does not bar\ntheir claims under the PTC\n\n\nMa\n\nAppendix C\nbeyond debate, This demanding standard protects all\nbut the plainly incompetent or those who knowingly\nlate the law.\u201d Za (internal citation and punctuation\nomitted).\n\n\u2018To that end, the Supreme Court of the United States\nhas \u201crepeatedly stressed that courts must not \u201cdefine\nclearly established law at a high level of generality, since\ndoing so avoids the crucial question [of] whether the of-\nficial acted reasonably in the particular cireumstances\nthat he or she faced.\u201d Za. at 590 (citation omitted). \u201cIt is\nnot enough that the rule is suggested by then-existing\nprecedent. The precedent must be elear enough that\nevery reasonable official would interpret it to establish\nthe particular rule the plaintiff seeks to apply.\u201d Jd.\n\nA plaintiff demonstrates the requisite rule by citing\n\u201c(1) case law with indistinguishable facts clearly estab-\nlishing the constitutional right; 2) a broad statement of\nprinciple within the Constitution, statute, or ease law\nthat clearly establishes a constitutional right; oF (3) eon-\nduct so egregious that a constitutional right was clearly\nviolated, even in the total absence of ease law.\"\" See\n\u2018Smith, 834 F 3d at 1297 (citation omitted), When relying\non ease law, a \u201cclose factual fit between the pre-existing\ncase and the present one is essential,\u201d and \u201c[gleneral\n\n* Only binding provedent\u2014decisions of the Supreme Court the\nEleventh Cireait or the highest court ofthe state\u2014can establish a\nconstitutional right beyond debate, See Eeholsw: Lawton, 913 F2\n1313, 1824 11th Ci 2019), However, \u201cnon-binding persuasive au\nthority ean be used to indicate that a particular constitutional right\nis notelearly established.\u201d Corbitt Vickers, 929 Pid 1304, 1319 n\n1M (lth Cir: 2018) (emphasis added,\n\n\n48a\nAppendix C\n\npropositions from earlier decisions will not do.\u201d Cantu v.\n\nGity of Dothan, 914 F 3d 1217, 1232 (11th Cir. 2020). The\n\nkey is whether the law gave the defendant \u201cfair warn-\n\ning\u201d at the time he engaged in the conduet that his ac-\n\ntions were unconstitutional. Id.\n\nHere, Plaintiffs point to the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion\nin Maryland v. Garrison, 480 U.S.79 (1987) and the Elev-\nenth Cireuit\u2019s decision in Hartsffeld v. Lemacks, 50 F.3d\n950 (11th Cir. 1995) as clearly establishing that Guerra\u2019s\nactions in this ease violated Plaintiffs\u2019 Fourth Amend-\nment rights. In Garrison, police officers executed a\nsearch warrant on a home described as occupying the\n\u201cthird floor\u201d of an apartment building, 480 U.S. at 81. Af-\nter the police officers began searching the plaintiff's\napartment, which was located on the third floor of the\nbuilding, they realized that there were two apartments\n\u2018on the floor and that they had entered the wrong home.\nId. at 86-87. They diseontinued the seareh at that point.\nTd. at 81.\n\nIn analyzing the cage, the Supreme Court \u201crecognized\nthe need toallow some latitude for honest mistakes that\nare made by officers in the dangerous and difficult pro-\ncess of making arrests and executing search warrants.\u201d\nJd. The Supreme Court noted, among other things, that\nthe officer who obtained the warrant had verified the in-\nformation obtained from a reliable informant, examined\nthe exterior of the building and sought information from\nthe utility company serving that address. /\u00a2, at 81. Ult\n\nmately, the Court found that because the \u201cobjective\nfacts available to the officers at the time suggested no\ndistinction between the plaintiff's apartment and the\n\n49a\nAppendix C\n\ntarget\u2019s apartment,\u201d the officers\u2019 search did not violate\nthe plaintiffs Fourth Amendment rights. Jd. at 88\n\nAt issue in Hartsfield was whether an officer's mis-\ntake in serving a warrant on the wrong home was rea-\nsonable where (i) he did not verify that he was leading\nthe other officers to the correct address as listed on the\nwarrant; (ii) he did not perform any \u201cprecautionary\nmeasures\u201d to avoid the mistake; (ii) the raid took place\nduring the day, and the numbers on the houses were\nclearly marked; and (iv) the plaintiff's and the target's\nhomes had distinguishable features and were located on\ndifferent parts of the street, separated by at least one\nother residence, 50 F.3d at 955, The Eleventh Cireuit ex-\nplained that because the officer \u201cdid nothing\u2019 to make\nsure that he was leading the other officers to the correct\nresidence,\u201d he was not protected by the doctrine of qual-\niffed immunity. 24. (emphasis added). Also important to\nthe court were the faets that the officer had visited the\ncorrect residence the day before the search and had ob-\ntained the search warrant based on his own observa-\ntions of a drug transaction at the home. Zd. The court\nemphasized that the officer\u2019s actions \u201cwere simply not\n\u2018consistent with a reasonable effort to ascertain and\nidentify the place intended to be searched.\u201d Za. (citing\nGarrison, 480 U.S. at 88-89). The court concluded that it\n\u2018was \u201cclearly established law that, absent probable cause\nand exigent cireumstances, a warrantless search of a\nresidence violates the Fourth Amendment, unless the\nofficers engage in reasonable efforts to avoid error.\u201d Jd.\n\n\u2018The foregoing cases demonstrate that a central issue\nin determining whether the doctrine of qualified\n\n5a\nAppendix C\n\nimmunity applies in a Fourth Amendment seareh war-\nrant eae is where to draw the line between reasonable\nand unreasonable measures taken to avoid error. To as-\nsist in this inquiry, the Eleventh Cireuit has eautioned\nthat \u201cInJone of its} precedents holds\u2014or logically com-\npels the conelusion\u2014that an offieer\u2019s well-intentioned\nattempts to ascertain and identify the property de-\nseribed in @ warrant are [unreasonable simply beeause\nthey lead to an error, or beeause more accurate means\nof ascertaining the property's identity were available.\u201d\nWhite v. Melain, 648 F. App'x 838, 841 (11th Cir, 2016).\nIndeed, \u201c{t]o he reasonable isnot to be perfect, and so\nthe Fourth Amendment allows for some mistakes on the\npart of government officials, giving them \u2018fair leeway for\nenforcing the law in the community's protection.\u201d Heien\nv. North Carolina, 574 US. 54, 60-61 2014) (quoting\nBrinogar v. United States, 888 U.S. 160, 176 (1949).\n\nBased on these prineiples, the court in White found\nthat an officer who \u201cdid attempt to ascertain and verify\nthat he had the right house,\u201d including by revisiting the\nblock where the house was located and taking: a photo-\ngraph of what he thought was the correet house, was\nprotected by the doctrine of quality [sie] immunity.\nWhite, 648 F. App's at 842-48, That court diseussed the\nEleventh Cireuit\u2019s prior opinion in Hartsfield and disa-\ngreed that that opinion stood for the proposition \u201cthat\nan officer who attempts to ascertain and verify the iden-\ntity of the place to be searched violates the Fourth\nAmendment if he fails to do everything possible to en-\nsure that he is nat mistaken.\u201d White, 648 F. App'x at 843.\nTo the contrary, the court focused on the steps the of-\nficer took in preparing to serve the warrant to\n\nBla\nAppendix C\n\ndetermine whether the officer\u2019s aetions were reasonable\nand passed muster. See ick see also Norris v. Hicks, 855\nF. App'x 515, 523-24 (11th Cir. 2021) (finding that offic-\ners who carefully planned a high-risk raid at the home of\na dangerous person were entitled to qualified immunity\nwhere they encountered unexpected circumstances that\nresulted in the warrant being executed at the wrong\nhome).\n\nHere, the Court has reservations regarding whether\nPlaintiffs\u2019 argument that Guerra failed to complete the\nSite Survey and the Drive-By presents a genuine dis-\npute of the facts. The evidenee Plaintiffs offer in support\nof their contention requires inferential leaps that are not\nnecessarily supported by the record. For example, miss-\ning geolocation data for the morning of the Drive-By\ndoes not necessarily mean that the Drive-By did not oc-\ncur, especially in light of the eorroborating deposition\ntestimony of Lemoine that the Drive-By did oceur. To\nsurvive summary judgment, Plaintiffs must do more\nthan raise \u201cmetaphysical doubt\" regarding the facts.\nGareaynski, 573 F.3d at 1165 (citation omitted). They\n\u2018must produce substantial evidence demonstrating that\nthere is a genuine issue of material fact. See id.\n\nEvenif, forargument\u2019s sake, the Court eredits Plain-\ntiffs\u2019 argument that Guerra did not conduct the Site Sur-\nvey and the Drive-By, the record contains undisputed\nevidence of several other steps that Guerra took to \u201cas-\ncertain and identify\u201d the home described in the warrant,\nWhite, 648 F. App\u2019x at 841. Guerra reviewed the Oper-\nation Order and Swat Addendum; he attended an oper-\national briefing; and he selected a staging area and made\n\n\n52a\nAppendix C\n\ntactical notes with knowledge and in consideration of the\nlocation of the home. These steps constitute considera-\nbly more than \u201cnothing.\u201d Hartsfield, 50 F.3d at 955. The\nrecord also contains evidence of detailed planning by\nother agents, including Agent Thompson's surveillance\nof 8741 Landau, upon which Guerra relied. The Court\nconsiders Guerra\u2019s overall preplanning to constitute sig-\nnificant \u201cprecautionary measures\u201d to avoid mistake. fd.\n\u2018The Court further finds that those measures were rea-\nsonable under the circumstances, See Heien, 574 U.S. at\n60 (noting that the Supreme Court has \u201crepeatedly af-\nfirmed\u201d that \u201cthe ultimate touchstone of the Fourth\nAmendment is reasonableness\u201d) (citation and punetua-\ntion marks omitted),\n\nMoreover, the execution of the warrant occurred in\nthe dark, and the house number was not affixed any-\nwhere on the house. It was listed on a mailbox at the end\nof the driveway on another street, and Plaintiffs agreed\nduring oral argument that checking the mailbox at that\nlocation in the midst of executing the warrant would\nhhave caused some delay in the operation. Such delay\ncould have been problematie because the warrant was\nbeing served on a dangerous individual under the cover\nof darkness, and the simultaneous execution of multiple\nrelated warrants was important to the overall operation.\n\nWhile, as Plaintifts point out, 3741 Landau and 3756\nDenville were dissimilar in some respeets and were sep-\narated by three or four homes, Plaintiffs do not dispute\nthat the two homes shared several conspicuous features,\nincluding a corner lot with a large tree and a tight stair-\nway leading to the front door. In all, itis not the role of\n\n58a\nAppendix C\n\nthe Court (and, indeed, the Court is ill-equipped) to play\n\nMonday morning quarterback and dictate what addi-\n\ntional steps Guerra should have taken in the universe of\nmeasures available to hin\n\nThat Guerra\u2019s efforts were ineffectual is not a basis\nto find that he acted unreasonably and in violation of the\nlaw. The Supreme Court emphasized in Messersehmide\nthat the doctrine of qualified immunity \u201cprotects all but\nthe plainly ineompetent or those who knowingly violate\nthe law.\u201d Messersehmiat, 565 U.S. at 546 (citation omit-\nted). The Court eannot conclude based on the record be-\nfore it that Guerra was either incompetent or that he\nknowingly broke the law. To the contrary, the record\nsupports the conclusion that Guerra simply made a mis-\ntake\u2014based on reasonable but mistaken judgment.\nGuerra\u2019s actions are therefore excused under the law.\n\u2018See idk Heien, 574 US. at 60-61 (stating that the Fourth\nAmendment allows leeway for mistakes by government\nofficials).\n\nImportantly, courts have granted immunity in cases\nthat reflect preparations similar to the steps Guerra un-\ndertook in this ease or for operations similar to the one\nat issue here. See, eg, Norris, 855 F. App'x at 523-24;\nWhite, 648 P, App's at 42-43; eff Hartsfield, 50 F'3d at\n955. Accordingly, the Court concludes that the law was\nnot clearly established at the time of the incident that\nGuerra's preparatory steps would be insufficient or that\nthey would otherwise be deemed unreasonable and vio-\nlative of the law. In other words, Guerra\u2019s actions did\nnot violate clearly established lave, and he is therefore\nentitled to qualified immunity against Plaintiffs claims.\n\nBla\nAppendix C\n\u00a9. Federal Torts [sic] Claims Act\n\nUnder the FTCA, the United States waived immun-\nity for claims related to an injury\n\ncaused by the negligent or wrongful act or omis-\nsion of any employee of the Government while\nacting within the scope of his office or employ~\nment, under circumstances where the United\nStates, ifa private person, would be liable to the\nclaimant in aecordanee with the law of the place\nwhere the act or omission occurred.\n\n28 USC. \u00a7 1346(0)(1). Thus, the FTCA \u201csimply allows\nthose injured by the acts or omissions of a government\nemployee to recover damages in the same way that they\nwould if they were injured by the acts or omissions of a\nprivate person.\u201d Smith v. United States, 14 Fath 1228,\n1282 (11th Cir, 2021). This means that a plaintiff must\nshow that a private person would be liable for the act or\nomission under state law. \u201cIa plaintiff fails to establish\nthat state-law duty, ...the United States retains its sov-\nreign immunity and the suit eannot go forward.\u201d Id.\n\n1 The\ntion\n\nceretionary Funetion Excep-\n\n\u2018The waiver of immunity under the FTCA is not ab-\nsolute. For example, it does not extend to \u201cthe failure to\nexercise or perform adiseretionary funetion or duty ...,\nwhether or not the diseretion involved be abused.\u201d 28\nU.S.C. \u00a7 2680(2). This earve out is commonly referred to\nas the discretionary function exception to the FTCA.\n\u2018See, e.g, Foster Logging, Ine. v. United States, 973 F.3d\n\n\nAppendix C\n1152, 1157 (11th Cir, 2020), \u201c(T]he purpose of the exeep-\ntion is to prevent judicial second-guessing of legislative\nand administrative decisions grounded in social, eco-\nnomic, and political poliey through the medium of an ac-\ntion in tort.\u201d United States v.

United\n\u2018States, 123 F.3d 1485, 1438 (11th Cir. 1997). With re-\nspect to the first prong of the test, the court \u201creadily\u201d\nfound that \u201cdecisions regarding, how to locate and iden-\ntify the subject of an arrest warrant\u201d involve \u201can ele-\n\u2018ment of judgment or choice.\u201d fd.\n\nWith respect to the second prong of the test, the\nMesa court explained that,\n\n[tdhe decision as to how to locate and identify the\nsubject of an arrest warrant prior to service of the\nwarrant is susceptible to policy analysis. For ex-\nample, in deciding how extensively to investigate\nthe location and identity of the subject, agents\nmay weigh the urgeney of apprehending the sub-\nject in light of such factors as the potential threat\n\nBta\n\nAppendix C\nthe subject poses to public safety and the likeli-\nhood that the subject may destroy evidence. A de-\nsire to keep the investigation secret\u2014for tactical\nreasons, to protect confidential sources, to protect.\nthe agents involved, or for other reasons\u2014may_\nalso factor into the decision as to how to locate and\nidentify the subject of a warrant. In addition,\nagents may consider their available resources and\ndecide how to allocate those resourees among the\nmany investigations for which they are responsi-\nble. All of these factors indicate that the decision\nregarding how to locate and identify the subject\nof an arrest warrant is fundamentally rooted in\npolicy considerations, and that judicial second-\nguessing of this decision thus is not appropriate.\n\nId, See also Vivas v. United States, No. 1:20-CV-02217,\n2021 WL 2582300, at *8 (N.D. Ga. Apr. 21, 2021) (stating\nthat \u201cdecisions made by ... officers in determining how\nand where to locate the subject of the warrant [served\nat the wrong home] are covered by the diseretionary\nfunetion exception\u201d).\n\nApplying the principles set forth in Zelayaand Mesa\nhere, this Court finds that Guerra's efforts in preparing\nto execute the warrant at 8741 Landau involved judg-\nment and choice, There was no statute, regulation or\neven internal operating procedure prescribing Guerra\u2019s\ncourse of action. To the contrary, Guerra\u2019s actions in-\nvolved multiple independent decisions regarding how to\ninvestigate the location where the warrant was to be\nserved and direct the team in executing the warrant. As\nexplained in Mesa, these decisions involve policy\n\n58a\nAppendix C\n\nconsiderations and should not be subject to judicial see-\nond-guessing.\n\n\u2018The Court is not convinced by Plaintiffs\u2019 argument\nthat Guerra lacked diseretion in executing the search\nwarrant because the warrant identified a specific loca-\ntion. While itis true that the warrant named 8741 Lan-\ndau as the place of execution, and the warrant therefore\ncould not be served at another location, it is also true\nthat Guerra had to make numerous decisions regarding\nhowto execute the warrant. This is the epitome of dis-\ncretion.\n\n\u2018The Court is likewise not persuaded by Plaintiffs\u2019 at-\ntempt to distinguish the Mesa opinion from the facts of\nthis ease. Plaintiffs argue that Mesa involved only an ar-\nrest warrant, and the opinion was therefore limited to\nthat narrow cireumstanee. However, the Eleventh Cir-\ncuit did not expressly limit its opinion in that way, and\nits general discussion of the decision-making process to\ninvestigate the location of a subject is relevant here. See\nMesa, 123 F 34d at 1438. As such, the Mesa opinion is ap-\nposite.\n\nForthese reasons, the Court concludes that Guerra's\nactions are covered under the discretionary function ex-\nception to the PTCA. This means that the Court lacks\njurisdiction to consider Plaintiffs\u2019 tort claims unless they\nare permitted by another provision of the FTCA.\n\n\u2018Pains noted that they wish to preserve for appeal their argu-\nrent thatthe diseretionary function exception should not apply to\nViolations of constitutional rights. However, as Plintifs eonced,\n\n5a\nAppendix C\n2. The Law Enforeement Proviso\n\nUnder \u00a7 2680(h) of the FTCA, the United States ex-\npressly declined to waive immunity for specific claims,\nincluding those arising out of assault, battery, false im-\nprisonment and false arrest. However, this exception\ndoes not apply to Ge, immunity is waived for) six inten-\ntional torts where they concern aets or omissions of \u201cin-\nvestigative or law enforcement officers of the United\nStates Government.\u201d Jd. The six enumerated torts for\nwhich immunity is waived are assault, battery, false im-\nprisonment, false arrest, abuse of process and malicious\nprosecution, Jd. This earve out for actions arising out of\nthe conduct of law enforcement is known as the law en-\nforcement proviso. See Millbrook v. United States, 969\nU.S. 50, 58-58 (2013). The law enforcement proviso ap-\nplies regardless of whether the diseretionary function\nexception would otherwise deny jurisdiction over the\nclaims, See, e.g, Williums v. United States, 314 F, App\u2019s\n258, 258-59 (11th Cir. 2009) (stating that the law en-\nforcement proviso \u201cwaives sovereign immunity for bat-\ntery claims against federal law enforcement offteals, in-\ncluding battery claims arising out of those aets or omis-\nsions that fulfill a diseretionary funetion\u201d)..\n\nthe Eleventh Cireuit recently rejected that argument in Shivers\nUnited States, 1 Fath 24 (1th Cx. 2021,\n\n* For purposes of this provision, \u201ca law enforcement officer i any\nciter of the United States who is empovtered by la to execute\n\u2018searches, to seize evidence, oF to make arrests Tor violations of fed\ntral lav\u201d Willams x: United States, 314 P.

The\nclaims for false arrest, false imprisonment and assault\nand battery clearly fall under the law enforcement pro-\nviso.\u201d Therefore, those claims survive, despite the\nCourt\u2019s finding herein that they are exeluded by the dis-\ncretionary function exception. The remaining claims\u2014\nfor trespass, interference with private property, negli-\ngent/intentional infliction of emotional distress and neg-\nligence\u2014are not covered by the law enforcement pro-\nviso and therefore remain excluded. Consequently, the\nCourt lacks jurisdietion as to Counts III, IV and V of,\neach complaint, and the United States. entitled to sum-\nmary judgment on those claims. The Court has jurisdie-\ntion as to Counts and I of the complaints and will now\nconsider the merits of those claims.\n\n3. Merits of the Claims\n\nAAs set forth above, the United States ean be liable\nunder the FTCA only to the extent thata private person\n\u2018would be liable under the law of the place where the in-\ncident occurred. Seo28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346()(). Since the in-\ncident occurred in Georgia, the Court must apply the\nlaw of Georgia as it pertains to liability ofa private per-\nson under the facts of this ease. See Smith, 14 Fath at\n1282,\n\n\"The parties donot dispute that Guerra law enforcement officer\nofthe United States Government\n\n6la\nAppendix C\n\n& Count I (Palse Arrest/Impris-\nonment)\n\nUnder Georgia law, a false arrest is an \u201carrest under\nprocess of law, without probable cause, when made ma-\nliciously.\u201d 0.C.G.A. \u00a7 51-7-1.

(citation, alterations and quotation\nmarks omitted).\n\n62a\nAppendix C\n\nHere, Defendants argue that Plaintiffs do not have a\nfalse arrest claim because the arrest did not invalve a\nwarrant. They contend that Plaintiffs may assert only a\nfalse imprisonment claim, Defendants urge the Court to\ngrant summary judgment on Plaintifls\u2019 false imprison-\n\u2018ment claim on the grounds that Guerra acted in good\nfaith, Although Defendants acknowledge that the issue\nof good faith is typically a fuct question, they contend\nthat they should prevail in this ease because the record\nis clear that no agent acted in bad faith,\n\nPlaintiffs respond that the most analogous law appli-\ncable to private persons is Georgia's citizen's arrest\nlaw.\" Under that statute, \u201c(al private person may arrest\nan offender if the offense is committed in his presence or\nwithin his immediate knowledge. If the offense is a fel-\nony and the offender is escaping or attempting to es-\ncape, a private person may arrest him upon reasonable\nand probable grounds of suspicion.\u201d 0.C.G.A. \u00a7 17-4460.\n\nPlaintiffs argue that summary judgment is inappro-\npriate here because Defendants cannot show that the ar-\nrest was proper under the citizen's arrest statute. They\npoint out that Plaintiffs did not commit an offense in De-\nfendants\u2019 presence, and they were not attempting to flee\nat the time Defendants entered their home.\n\nPlaintiffs farther contend that O.C.G.A. \u00a7 51-7-21,\nwhich Defendants cite as a basis for their good faith de-\nfense, applies only to law enforcement officers serving a\nwarrant. Thus, Plaintiffs assert that the statute is not\n\n\u2018The etien\u2019s arrest law was in effect at the time of the incident\nbout has sine heen repealed,\n\n63a\nAppendix C\n\napplicable to an FTCA claim, which requires a private\nperson analog law. Plaintiffs also argue that, in any\nevent, the record does not support a good faith defense\nbecause Guerra did not exereise ordinary eare in exeeut-\ning the warrant.\n\nAdditionally, Plaintiffs argue that Defendants\nwaived their good faith defense. Plaintifils maintain that\nDefendants may not raise a good faith defense at the\nsummary judgment stage because they did not include\nthe defense in their answer.\n\n\u2018The Court agrees with Defendants that the record\ndoes not support a false arrest claim because the arrest\nin this ease was not executed pursuant to a warrant that\nnamed Plaintiffs. See Ferrell, 672 8.B.2d at 10 (empha-\nsizing that a false arrest claim is improper where there\nis no arrest warrant). The Court, however, disagrees\nthat summary judgment is proper on Plaintiffs\u2019 false im-\nprisonment claim,\n\nFirst, itisnot clear that the good faith defense, which\nconstitutes Defendants\u2019 primary argument for summary\nJudgment, applies here. 0.C.G.A. \u00a7 51-7-21, whieh De-\nfendants ite as support for their good faith defense,\nprovides that \u201cfilf imprisonment is by virtue of a war\nrant, neither the party who procured the warrant in\ngood faith nor the officer who executed the warrant in\ngood faith shall be liable for false imprisonment even if\nthe warrant is defective in form or is void for lack of ju-\nrisdition.\u201d Thus, on its face, the statute relates to a law\nenforcement officer serving a warrant, not to an officer\nexeeuting a warrantless arrest or to a private person\n\n64a\n\n\u201cAppendix C\ndetaining another. Itis therefore doubtful that the stat-\ntate applies in the instant FTCA context, which requires\nthe Court to apply a private person analog law.\"\n\nFurther, the citizen's arrest statute, which Plaintiffs\noffer as the applicable private person analog law, does\nnot appear to contemplate a good faith defense.\" That\nstatute authorizes an arrest if the offense was commit-\nted in the presence of the citizen or was within his im-\nmediate knowledge. See 0.C.G.A. \u00a7 17-4-60. A citizen\nmay rely on reasonable and probable grounds of suspi-\ncion only in eireumstances that involve a felony and an\noffender who is attempting to escape. See id. Defend-\nants have not cited any ease law or otherwise shown that\n1 good faith defense would generally apply to the eiti-\nzen\u2019s arrest statute or where, as here, Plaintiffs commit-\nted no offense and were not attempting to flee.\n\nFinally, Georgia law appears to preclude a good faith de-\nfense where an arrest without a warrant is \u201cillegal.\u201d Col-\nins, 306 8.B.24 at 391. Collins follows eases like Vlass v.\nMeCrary, 5 8.8.24 63, 65 (Ga. Ct.

Willams, 255 SE-20\n{69 (Ga, 1970), which Defendants eite in support oftheir good fith\nsngument, all involve arrests by law enforcement officers serving\n\u2018warrants and are therefore of questionable relevance here\n\"Defendants do not dispute thatthe citizen's arvest statute isa pri-\nvate person analog law.

They also argue that the\nuuse of force was reasonable under the citizen's arrest\nstatute, and it was ce minimis,\n\nHowever, the self-defense statute is clearly inappli-\ncable under the facts of this ease. It is undisputed that\nPlaintiffs did not resist arrest or otherwise challenge the\nagents.\n\nLikewise, the cases Defendants cite regarding the\nreasonable or de minimis use of force are inapposite\n\u2018Those cases involve claims under the Fourth Amend-\nrent, where the quantum of force used by officers isrel-\nevant, whereas Georgia law precludes the application of\nthe reasonable or de minimisprineiples in abattery case.\n\u2018See Hendricks, 87 S.B.2d at 594 (stating that a battery\n\u201cmay be accomplished by an unauthorized caress as well\nas by an unauthorized blow\u201d). Defendants also have not,\nshown that a reasonableness or de minimis defense\n\u2018would apply to the assault claim,\n\nFinally, the Wiliams ease, which Defendants cite to\nsupport their argument that the force used in this ease\nwas reasonable, involved an arrest of a fleeing suspect\nfor whom a warrant had been issued. See Williams v.\n\nota\n\nAppendix C\nUnited States, 314 F. App\u2019s 258, 258 (11th Cir. 2009).\n\u2018The circumstances of this ease are quite different.\n\nBased on the foregoing analysis, the Court finds that\nDefendants are not entitled to summary judgment on\nPlaintiffs\u2019 false imprisonment claim (Count 1) and as-\nsault and battery claims (Count 11).\n\nII. CONCLUSION\n\nIn accordance with the Court\u2019s opinion herein, the\nCourt GRANTS Defendants\u2019 Motion (ECF No. 83) as to\nCounts III, IV, V and VI of the complaints and DE~\nNIES the Motion as to Counts I and II.\" Sinee the sole\naccount against Defendant Guerra (Count V1) is dis-\nmissed, the clerk is DIRECTED to terminate Guerra\nfrom this action.\"\n\nIn light of these rulings, the Court finds that this is\nan appropriate time for the parties to mediate this dis-\npute. Accordingly, the parties are DIRECTED to me-\ndiate the remaining claims in this matter before a neu-\ntral third party within forty-five days of the date of this\n\n\u201cFor the reasons described in footnote 12, sypra, the Court does\nnot reach Plinth\u2019 argument that Defendants waived their jus\nfication defense\n\n\"As explained above, Plaintiffs claims for false arrest are not via-\nbie under the facts of this ease. Thus, tothe extent that Plainifs\nincorporate claims fr false arrestin Count of the complaints, the\nlaims for false arestare hereby dsmisted,\n\n\"The Court does not address the arguments in the \u201cSpoliation\u201d see\ntion of Plaintfs response brief because, as Defendants point out,\nPlaintiffs donot request any specific reli\n\n68a\nAppendix C\n\nOrder. Within seven days of the date of this Order, the\n\nparties shall inform the Court whether they elect to me-\n\ndiate their dispute before a Magistrate Judge of this di-\nvision; if so, the Court will make the necessary referral.\n\nGiven the Order to mediate this dispute, the Clerk is\nDIRECTED to ADMINISTRATIVELY CLOSE the\ncase for docket management purposes. Administrative\nclosure will not prejudice the rights of the parties to this\nlitigation in any manner nor preclude the fling of docu-\nments,\n\n\u2018The parties must file a status report by the eonelu-\nsion of the forty-five day mediation period stating\nwhether mediation was successful. If mediation was un-\nsucessful, the parties may file a motion to reopen the\ncase with @ proposed schedule to complete the remain-\ning expert discovery in this ease. Plaintifis\u2019 motions for\nextension of time to complete expert discovery (ECF\nNos. 114 and 119) are therefore DENIED without prej-\ndice.\n\nThe Clerk is also DIRECTED to terminate Plain-\ntiffs\u201d motions to exelucle Defendants\u2019 reply to Plaintifis?\nStatement of Facts (ECF Nos. 109, 118) since Plaintifis\nhave withdrawn those motions.\n\nSO ORDERED this 23rd day of September, 2022,\n\n(signature)\nJ.P.

And where does that door lead?\nA. To the baleony outside,\nQ. Okay.\n\nAllright. I think that\u2019s enough to orient us because I\nwant to talk about the incident that\u2019s the subject of ~ of\nthe lawsuit.\n\nCan you describe in your own words what happened?\nA. The entire incident?\n\nQ Yes.\n\nA. Sure.\n\nAt what part do you want me to start at? When I was\nasleep? Before I got home? When ~~ when ~ when ~\nwhat \u2014where do you have me start?\n\nQ. Let's ~ let's start at before you got home. What\nare you referring to there?\n\nA. Before I got home, I was coming home from\nDurham, North Carolina. T had basieally parked my\ntruck, got all my stuff together, drove home approxi-\nmately, I guess, seven miles. Got home as I normally do.\nCame in through the garage. Of course, everybody was\nasleep. Took a shower, got into bed.\n\na\nAppendix E\nguess when I finally had fallen asleep, I just heard\n\na~a loud eannon-type bang that startled me and disori-\nented me. It startled me so\n\n(Page 90]\n\nbad to where I was lying flat, and I felt like T just sprung\n\"up out of the bed but was still laying flat. I don\u2019t know if,\nTlanded on my feet off - off the bed, or I landed baek on\nthe bed and then kind of got up.\n\nAnd I was ~ I just didn\u2019t know what was going on,\nwhat had happened, but I felt like it was some sort of\nhome invasion going on, [looked over at Trina, and she\nwas up, running around, and I was just kind of trying to\nget ourselves oriented on what was going on, Once I re-\nalized that ~ [felt that it was some sort of home invasion\n~- I keep my shotgun in the closet, which is behind the\nbathroom per se,\n\nSo I was on one side of the bedroom, and Trina was\nfn the opposite side, so we basically had to cross each\nother. Looks like she was running out of the room, and T\nwas running toward the closet to get my shotgun, so be-\nfore she could really cross me, I grabbed her, and I\npulled her in the room with me.\n\nAs I was running and pulling her toward the bath-\nroom area, I eould hear footsteps on ~ on the steps be-\ncause it's wood, and I assume they had on boots or what~\never, but I could hear it, And it sounded like people go-\ning downstairs and upstairs\n\n\nTa\nAppendix E\n(Page 91]\n\naround the same time. So I said to myself, that\u2019s a lat of,\npeople. And I was thinking about if I was going to have\nenough bullets to protect myself because I~ I'm think-\ning it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s an actual gang of people who entered into\nthe house.\n\nAnd I kind of heard them coming down the hallway,\nsand they had entered into the bedroom, so I something\njust didn't seem right, but I wasn't sure, And so I would,\nhear them going like clear, clear, or something like that\nin referenee to that. And I wanted to buy some time, so\nwwe went into the closet, and I elosed the door because I\n\u2018was trying to figure out what was going on, Wait a see-\nond.\n\nGive me one second. I apologize.\n\nQ. Let me just \u2014let me just ~ where did you go right\n\nA, Lwent to the bathroom. I grabbed a tissue.\nQ Okay. Okay,\n\nA. So I heard people enter into the bathroom, and I\nhad this feeling of it\u2019s now or never, you got to make a\ndecision, you know? Are you going to shoot it up with\nthese people, or, you know, are you just going to just\ngive in and just let them do what they're going to do? So\nas [was thinking, I was\n\n8a\nAppendix E\n(Page 92]\n\nlike, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a home invasion, because I'm hear-\ning police ta k [sic)\n\nI mean, I'm reverting back to watehing T.V. and\nhearing this type of lingo when they go into people's\nhomes, you know, making sure that there's not a threat.\nsaying clear, clear. So something was telling me don't do\nanything with this shotgun. Don't do it. Its not going to\nend well, but I wasn't sure,\n\nSo they knocked on the door and was telling me to\ncome out, and I was like, who are ~ you know, what's\ngoing on? Who are you? And they was like, open the\ndoor, it\u2019s the police or something of that nature, but I~\n[still wasn't sure, I wasn't a hundred pereent sure what\nwas going on.\n\nBut my overall decision just said it's not going to end\nwell. If you shoot through this door, everybody is going\nto die, So I reluctantly released the door because I ~\nwas blocking them \u2014 them from opening it. They ~- they\nhave to press the door inwards to open it, and I was pre~\nventing that from happening.\n\nSo I opened the door, they snatch me out. Trina kind\nof fell because she was actually closer to the opening of\nthe door than I was because \u2014 s0\n\na\nAppendix E\n(Page 93]\n\nthey literally pulled me out. I believe she fell down in the\ncloset. Not to mention she didn't have on any clothes. So\nTwas embarrassed for her but yet fearful for my life at\nthe same time,\n\nThey pulled me out of the eloset, pulled me through\nthe bathroom, and then they threw me down on the floor\nin the master bedroom, And all ~all the time I'm asking\nthem, what's going on, this, that, and the third, and so\nwhen I'm laying on the ground, and I look up, I see all\nthese you know, appearing military dressed guys with\ntheir automatie weapons all pointed at me. So I immedi-\nately just ~ you know, I immediately just faced down,\n\nAnd they started bombarding me with all these\nquestions, and some of them I didn\u2019t hear, didn\u2019t know\nwhat they were referring to, And I was really confused.\nSo I~ remember him asking me what was my name ~\nlike my vital information, What was my name? What\nwas my address? Blah blah blah, And when ~ when T\ngave them my address, it just kind of got quiet. You\nknow, all the noise just ended,\n\nAnd 1 heard him tell one of the officers to go check\nthe address. And I hear him leaving out ofthe room or\nwhatever. And I guess about a minute\n\n(Page 94)\n\nor two, he came back in and whispered something to the\nlead officer and the lead officer, after that, he picked me\n\n80a\nAppendix E\n\nup, took the handeutis off of me, and he was just like, Pl\nbe right back,\n\nAnd him an his team started proceeding out of the\nhouse. And so I started following behind him, and T told\nTrina to check on il to make sure he's okay. And so\nI'm following them basically out of the house, trying to\nsee what's going on. Why did they do what they did?\nAnd they -- they all kind of -- he forcefully, you know,\ntold mo, hey, you know, Tl be right back, you know?\n\n\u2018No one would give me any explanation, And so I saw\nthem all meet in my front yard, and he gave them some\norders, and they started going, and they all jumped in\nthese unmarked cars, And I was sitting outside on the\nfront poreh, and I watched them go down the street on\nthe corner and basically do the same thing as far as en-\ntering into that house the way they ~ I assume they did\nat mine,\n\nAnd Isaid to myself.at that point, damn, I think they\nhit the wrong house. I think that was the house they\nwere supposed to get initially. They made a mistake.\nAnd so I watched them go in the house, round the people\nup inside the house, do what\n\n[Page 95]\n\nthey had to do, I went back inside to eek on \u2018hina\nHMMM rut mysete. Ard at some point, he did return back\nto the house, and he apologized, you know?\n\nHe gave me a card, said he had already contacted his\nsuperiors and to just give him a call, and they'll take care\n\nSia\nAppendix E\n\nof everything. And that was basieally it, I was just left\nthere to ~ with the door hanging off, with no type of se-\ncurity.\n\nAnd I basieally just stood there, you know, in front\nof the house all night until -- well, you know, until the\nsun came up. And that was basically the rundown of\nwhat happened to the best of my recollection\n\nQ. Okay. Thank you. P'l-you know, ask you more\nspecifie questions.\n\nHave you ever experienced a home invasion before?\n\nA. You mean as far as with the police or with ~ well,\nTl give you my answer, no, I haven't.\n\nQ. Just because you asked that did ~ have you expe-\nrieneed a home invasion without police?\n\nALNo.\n\nQ. Have you~ have you ever experienced a burglary\nin the home?\n\nA. With me in it?\n[Page 148]\n\nQ. Did he ever show you the warrants that were in-\nvolved in this ease?\n\nALNo.\n\na\nAppendix E\nQ Did he ever give you any understanding of why\nthey were going to 3741 Landau?\nALNo.\n\nQ.Did you ever eall the number on the business eard\nthat he gave you?\n\nAdi,\nQ. And who did you speak with?\n\nA. T'm not sure,\n\n. Do you recall what you spoke about on that eall?\n\nA. Yeah. We spoke about, I guess, like damages\npretty much. If I recall properly because I remember\nasking him before he left, are they going to repair the\ndoor? And he was like, no, we don't do that. So I do recall\nspeaking to the person on the number about that, seeing\nif they was going to send somebody out to repair or\nwhat's the process beeause that was my main concern at\nthat time,\n\nQ.The property damage?\n\nA. Security of a home. The door was not operational.\n\nQ. And when you ealled the number, was there\n(Page 149],\n\nany representation made about repairing the - the prop-\nerty that was damaged?\n\n8a\nAppendix E\nA. Lremember asking, and she told me that I would\nhave to take eare of that. And then probably, you know,\ncould maike an insurance claim and then some kind of\nway they would pay the insurance claim to the ~ to my\ninsurance company.\n\nQ You agree that there were a number of agents in-\nvolved in coming to your home; correet?\n\nALYes.\n\nQ. What do you contend specifically that Agent\nGuerra did wrong?\n\nMR. GREENAMYRE: Objection. Calls for a legal\nconclusion or attorney-client materials ~ attorney-client\nconversations that we've had.\n\nMR. ROSS: Are you instructing him not to answer?\n\nMR. GREENAMYRE: You ~ you ean answer to it.\nBut don't talk about anything that we have talked about,\n\u2018you~ you and me.\n\nTHE WITNESS: I have a simple answer.

Okay.\n\nIn your own words, can you tell me what you recall\nabout the incident?\n\nALYes.\nOn that particular night, I was sleeping. I heard\n\nbanging noises, and initially, I thought it was something\noutside, but the noises start to get closer. And then I\n\n88a\n\nAppendix F\nstarted to see bright lights and hearing a lot of bangs,\nand I realized that whatever it was, they were ~ it was\nin my \u2014 inside my house.\n\n(Page 52]\n\nI woke up Hilliard \u2014 Mr. Cliatt and told him that\nsomeone was breaking into our home. As I was running\ntowards the door to get my son, I~ Hilliard pulled me\ntowards the bathroom, which was located in our master\nbedroom. And then, from there, he pulled me into the\ncloset which was located in our bathroom ~ our master\nbathroom,\n\nI kept yelling, I need to go get my son ~ I kept yell-\ning, I need to go get my son. And when we were in the\ncloset, Hilliard -- Mr. Cliatt - we start to get the shotgun\nthat he had on the top shelf of the closet. I ~ I was in ~\nwas laying right underneath him asif was if was seek-\ning security or protection,\n\nAshe was reaching up to get the shotgun ~ as he was\nreaching up to get the shotgun, at the most hideous mo-\nment, the door opened, and there was aman. And at that\ntime, they were dressed in, like, SWAT outfits and uni-\nform and had masks on. So that's when they announced,\nfinally, that it was the FBI, but I didn\u2019t see anything on\ntheir clothing that said SWAT or FBI or anything that\nindicated that they were police.\n\nSo in my mind, I didn't ~ I didn\u2019t believe it because\nthey hadn't announced themselves\n\n8a\nAppendix F\n(Page 53]\n\nialy. And we were good-standing abiding citizens.\nAnd we didn\u2019t do anything for someone like the FBI to\ncome in our home. So at the time they ~ they pulled Mr.\nCliatt out the closet. And drag him out to the floor, hand\ncuffed him, When they did that, I fell in the comer of the\ncloset, halfdressed, only had on a little T-shirt, I didn\u2019t\nhave on any underwear or anything like that.\n\nTwas ~ the guy that was in the eloset with me was\npointing a gun at my face. And I just kept up like, just\ncalling for my son, asking if my son was okay, where is\nhe? And the guy that had his gun in my face just kept\ntelling me to worry about keeping my hands up. And T\ncould hear Mr. Cliatt being interrogated. They asked\nseveral questions, and when they were asking him the\nquestions, I - I \u2014 I remember looking over because\ncan see on my left-hand side that they were all eireled\naround him, and he was laying on the ground.\n\nAnd one of the last questions out of many that they\nasked him was, what's your address? And when he said\nthe address, I Saw one officer walk out the room. I don\u2019t.\nknow where he went. Shortly eame back and whispered\nin one of the other officer's ear, and then they announced\nthat they had the wrong\n\n(Page 54]\naddress, Allowed us to get up.\n\n\u2018The officer that was in the closet with me put his gun\ndown to let me get up. Yelled out, she doesn\u2019t have any\n\na\nAppendix F\n\nclothes on, let her through so she ean put some clothes\n\non, As I was walking in the room, everyone stormed out\n\nthe house, and when I came back out, I can see them go-\ning to the next block to the correct address.\n\nLater on, Mr. ~ Officer Guerra? Guerra? I'm not sure\nif I'm saying his name correctly. Came back. He person\nally apologized to my son, telling him that it wasn't his\nfault, and they apologize and don\u2019t think that he did an-\nything wrong. And he gave us a eard and went outside.\n\nQ. Do you recall what time you had gone to bed the\n~ the night of the incident?\n\nA.No. I don't recall the time I went to bed, no.\n\nQ. Do you recall what time you put GW to bed, or\nwhat time GW went to bed?\n\nA.

          "task_beliefs": "My initial understanding is based on the case summary for *Martin v. United States*, Docket 24-362. The case involves a mistaken no-knock raid by FBI agents on the Martin family's home. The core legal conflict stems from the lower courts granting immunity to the agents and the government. My knowledge is currently limited to the two central legal questions presented for appeal: 1) Whether the Supremacy Clause bars Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA) suits for wrongful federal employee actions that are related to carrying out federal policy, and 2) Whether the FTCA's discretionary-function exception is automatically inapplicable to intentional torts by law enforcement. The latest observation, which was an internal reasoning step, did not introduce new external facts about the case but did confirm that my primary uncertainty lies in the specific legal precedents and statutory interpretations that the petitioners (Martin family) will use to argue against the lower court's rulings on these two questions. My immediate goal is to uncover these specific arguments.",
          "design_beliefs": "I began with no knowledge of effective strategies for predicting Supreme Court decisions. My first observation, an internal reasoning process, has provided a foundational heuristic for this type of task. A highly effective initial strategy for analyzing a Supreme Court case is to locate and analyze the **Petition for a Writ of Certiorari**. This document is identified as a high-value primary source because it contains the petitioner's most persuasive arguments, which were successful in convincing the Court to take the case. Analyzing it is an efficient method to: 1) understand the core legal arguments from the petitioner's perspective, 2) identify the specific lower court rulings being challenged, and 3) learn why the case is considered of national importance, which often involves pointing out a \"circuit split\" (where different federal appellate courts have ruled differently on the same legal issue). This establishes a general principle for my methodology: prioritize foundational legal documents that frame the conflict for the Court itself, as they provide a direct and concise path to the central issues of the case. This approach is expected to be effective for reducing uncertainty about both task-specific parameters (\u03b8) and the broader legal landscape (D)."

          "task_beliefs": "My initial understanding of *Martin v. United States* (Docket 24-362) was based on the case summary, which outlined a mistaken no-knock raid and the two legal questions on appeal regarding the Supremacy Clause and the discretionary-function exception to the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA). My primary uncertainty was the specific legal arguments the Martin family would use.\n\nThis new observation has substantially deepened my knowledge by providing the full text of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit's opinion. I now have a detailed factual record and, crucially, the precise legal reasoning the petitioners must overcome.\n\nKey new facts and legal context include:\n*   **Operational Details:** The raid was part of \"Operation Red Tape,\" targeting a violent gang member. The lead agent, Lawrence Guerra, conducted a daylight site survey of the correct house but was misled by his personal GPS during a pre-raid drive-by in the dark.\n*   **Factual Basis for \"Reasonable Mistake\":** The court found the mistake understandable because the two houses shared numerous conspicuous features (color, split-level design, corner lot, large tree, side-entry garage, house number on mailbox but not on the house itself). This similarity will be a central point of contention.\n*   **Eleventh Circuit's Reasoning on Qualified Immunity:** The court granted Agent Guerra qualified immunity, finding his actions did not violate a \"clearly established\" right. It determined his mistake was \"reasonable\" under the Fourth Amendment, citing *Maryland v. Garrison*. The court concluded that his preparatory steps (reviewing orders, attending briefings) constituted a \"reasonable effort to avoid error,\" even though the effort ultimately failed.\n*   **Eleventh Circuit's Reasoning on FTCA Claims:** The court dismissed the FTCA claims based on two separate doctrines:\n    1.  **Discretionary Function Exception:** This barred the negligence, emotional distress, and trespass claims. Citing *Mesa v. United States*, the court reasoned that an agent's decision on *how* to locate and identify a target is a discretionary act involving policy judgment, thus shielding the government from liability for those choices.\n    2.  **Supremacy Clause:** This barred the intentional tort claims (false imprisonment, assault and battery). This is the most critical finding. The court relied heavily on its recent precedent in *Kordash v. United States* (51 F.4th 1289), which established a two-part test: the government is immune if the agent's acts (1) have a nexus to federal policy and (2) can be reasonably characterized as complying with federal law (the Fourth Amendment). Since the court had already deemed the agent's actions a \"reasonable mistake\" that did not violate the Fourth Amendment for qualified immunity purposes, it concluded the same reasoning applied here, barring the claims.\n\nMy prediction must now center on how the Supreme Court will treat the Eleventh Circuit's reasoning, particularly its application of *Kordash*. The petitioners, represented by the Institute for Justice (a fact learned from procedural documents), will likely argue that the *Kordash* framework improperly conflates the \"reasonable mistake\" standard for qualified immunity with the separate question of state tort liability under the FTCA, effectively creating a new form of absolute immunity that Congress did not intend. My uncertainty is no longer about what the petitioners' arguments *might be*, but rather how the Supreme Court will weigh these specific, now-identified arguments against the Eleventh Circuit's established precedent.",
          "design_beliefs": "My initial design belief was that the most effective strategy for this task is to locate and analyze the **Petition for a Writ of Certiorari** as a high-value primary source. This document provides the petitioner's core arguments and frames the national importance of the case.\n\nThis observation has refined and expanded that belief. While the search for the petition itself failed, it yielded an even more foundational document: the appendix containing the lower court opinion. This experience has generated several new, more sophisticated heuristics:\n\n1.  **Refined Heuristic - The Power of the Appendix:** When a direct search for a primary Supreme Court filing (like a petition or brief) is unsuccessful or returns only procedural documents, the next most effective action is to **search for and analyze the Appendix to that filing**. The appendix often contains the full text of the lower court opinion being appealed, which provides the essential legal and factual foundation of the case *before* you even read the petitioner's arguments. Understanding the decision being challenged is a prerequisite to understanding the challenge itself.\n2.  **New Heuristic - Context from Counsel:** Procedural documents, while not containing substantive arguments, can provide valuable metadata. Identifying the petitioners' counsel as the **Institute for Justice** signals that the case is likely being framed as a significant civil liberties issue, backed by a sophisticated public interest law firm. This information helps anticipate the style and philosophical bent of the arguments.\n3.  **Search Strategy Improvement:** A simple keyword search for a document title can fail. The search returned procedural filings (\"Certificate of Word count,\" \"Proof of Service\") that contained the query phrase. A more robust future strategy would be to refine searches to look for exact titles, prioritize larger file sizes, or specifically query for \"Appendix\" if the primary document is not found. This demonstrates that docket navigation requires precision and a willingness to pivot to secondary-but-critical documents.\n\nMy methodology has evolved from a simple \"find the petition\" approach to a more resilient, multi-step process: 1) Attempt to find the primary brief (Petition). 2) If that fails, immediately pivot to finding its Appendix. 3) Analyze the lower court opinion in the Appendix to establish a baseline understanding of the legal reasoning under review. 4) Use procedural documents to gather contextual metadata like the identity of counsel. This layered approach is more robust to search failures and builds a more comprehensive understanding of the case from the ground up."

United States* (24-362) is built upon the foundational facts of the mistaken no-knock raid by FBI agents during \"Operation Red Tape.\" My knowledge was significantly deepened by analyzing the Eleventh Circuit's opinion, which established the precise legal landscape the petitioners must navigate.\n\nThis analysis provided critical details:\n*   **Factual Basis for Mistake:** The lower court deemed the agent's error \"reasonable\" due to the striking similarities between the Martins' home and the target residence, a finding that is central to the entire case.\n*   **Qualified Immunity Reasoning:** The court granted Agent Guerra qualified immunity by applying the \"reasonable mistake\" doctrine from *Maryland v. Garrison*, concluding his pre-raid planning constituted a sufficient effort to avoid error, thus not violating a \"clearly established\" right.\n*   **FTCA Dismissal Reasoning:** The court barred the family's claims against the U.S. government using two key exceptions:\n    1.  **Discretionary Function Exception:** This shielded the government from negligence claims, as the agent's method for identifying a target was deemed a discretionary policy judgment, citing *Mesa v. United States*.\n    2.  **Supremacy Clause:** This barred the intentional tort claims (assault, false imprisonment). The court applied its own precedent from *Kordash v. United States*, which holds the government immune if an agent's actions have a nexus to federal policy and can be reasonably characterized as complying with the Fourth Amendment. The court's prior finding of a \"reasonable mistake\" for qualified immunity was used to satisfy this test.\n\nThe latest observation, an internal `THINK` action, does not introduce new external facts but serves to confirm and solidify this understanding. The agent's reasoning validates that a full grasp of the Eleventh Circuit's opinion is the correct baseline. My belief state is now stable regarding the facts and lower court logic. My primary uncertainty is no longer about the case's foundation but has sharpened considerably: I need to discover the specific arguments the Institute for Justice (petitioners' counsel) will use to attack the Eleventh Circuit's framework. The central predictive question is how the Supreme Court will react to the argument that the *Kordash* test improperly conflates the officer-protecting standard of qualified immunity with the government-liability standard of the FTCA, thereby creating a form of absolute immunity not intended by Congress.",
          "design_beliefs": "My initial design heuristic was simple: find the Petition for a Writ of Certiorari. Experience has proven this to be an incomplete strategy. My methodology has evolved into a more resilient, multi-step process:\n\n1.  **Prioritize Primary Sources:** The Petition for Certiorari remains the highest-value document for understanding the petitioner's arguments and the case's claimed national importance.\n2.  **The Appendix Pivot:** If a direct search for a primary filing fails, the most effective secondary action is to locate and analyze its Appendix. The Appendix contains the lower court opinion, which provides the indispensable factual and legal context upon which the appeal is built. Understanding the decision under review is a prerequisite to understanding the appeal itself.\n3.  **Leverage Metadata:** Procedural documents, while lacking substantive arguments, provide crucial context. Identifying the petitioners' counsel as the Institute for Justice was a key piece of metadata that helps frame the case as a major civil liberties issue and anticipates a high level of legal craftsmanship.\n4.  **Refine Search Techniques:** Simple keyword searches are prone to failure by returning procedural noise. A more robust strategy involves using precise queries, filtering by document type or title (e.g., \"Petition for a Writ of Certiorari\"), and looking for secondary indicators like file size.\n\nThe latest `THINK` observation reinforces and validates this evolved methodology. It demonstrates the agent consciously applying these learned heuristics. The agent's internal monologue\u2014acknowledging the previous search was \"too broad\" and planning a \"more precise search\" to \"filter out procedural noise\"\u2014confirms the value of the \"Refine Search Techniques\" heuristic. This observation also highlights the importance of a \"synthesis\" step in the research cycle. Pausing to think, confirm the current state of knowledge, and plan the next action based on prior successes and failures is a critical component of an effective design. My belief is now that an optimal research strategy is not just a sequence of actions, but a cycle of: **Plan -> Execute -> Synthesize/Review -> Refine Plan.**"

          "task_beliefs": "My understanding of *Martin v. United States* (24-362) is rooted in the mistaken no-knock raid on the Martin family's home and the subsequent legal battle. My analysis of the Eleventh Circuit's opinion provided the essential legal framework, establishing that the court deemed the agents' mistake \"reasonable\" under *Maryland v. Garrison*, thereby granting qualified immunity. This \"reasonableness\" finding was then pivotal in dismissing the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA) claims against the U.S. government. The court shielded negligence claims via the discretionary function exception (*Mesa v. United States*) and, critically, barred intentional tort claims by applying the Supremacy Clause through its own *Kordash v. United States* precedent. This precedent holds the government immune if an agent's actions are connected to federal policy and can be reasonably characterized as Fourth Amendment-compliant\u2014a test the court found was met by its earlier qualified immunity ruling.\n\nMy primary uncertainty had been focused on how the petitioners, represented by the Institute for Justice, would dismantle this legal structure. I hypothesized that their core argument would be that the *Kordash* test improperly merges the officer-centric qualified immunity standard with the government-liability standard of the FTCA, effectively creating an absolute immunity Congress never intended.\n\nThe latest observation confirms I have now successfully located the single most important document to resolve this uncertainty: the **Petition for a Writ of Certiorari**. While the observation itself does not contain the petition's text, its successful retrieval is a critical breakthrough. My task-level focus now shifts from *searching* for the petitioners' arguments to *analyzing* them directly. The path to a prediction is now clear and concrete: a thorough reading of this document will reveal the precise legal theories the Supreme Court is being asked to consider, allowing me to assess their strength and potential reception by the current Court.",
          "design_beliefs": "My design methodology has evolved from a simplistic \"find the petition\" approach into a more sophisticated and resilient research cycle: **Plan -> Execute -> Synthesize/Review -> Refine Plan**. This cycle is built on a set of core heuristics:\n\n1.  **Prioritize Primary Sources:** The Petition for Certiorari and the Opinion Below are the highest-value documents.\n2.  **The Appendix Pivot:** If a primary filing is elusive, its Appendix is the next best target, as it contains the lower court opinion, providing essential context.\n3.  **Leverage Metadata:** Procedural details, like the identity of counsel (Institute for Justice), provide crucial framing for the case's significance and legal strategy.\n4.  **Refine Search Techniques:** Simple keyword searches are inefficient. Precise queries are superior.\n\nThe latest observation provides powerful validation for this entire evolved strategy, particularly for the \"Refine Search Techniques\" heuristic. The successful `CLOSED_SEARCH` action was not a blind attempt; it was a direct implementation of the plan formulated during the previous `THINK` step to overcome the noise generated by broader searches. The use of specific `field_filters`\u2014`'proceeding_title': 'Petition for a Writ of Certiorari'` and `'link_name': 'Petition'`\u2014was the decisive factor. This success elevates the heuristic from a good idea to a proven, high-efficacy strategy. It demonstrates conclusively that in a structured data environment like a court docket, filtering on known metadata fields is vastly more effective than relying on full-text keyword searches. This reinforces my belief that the most effective design is an iterative loop where failures are diagnosed, plans are refined, and subsequent actions are executed with increasing precision."

          "task_beliefs": "My understanding of *Martin v. United States* (24-362) remains centered on the Eleventh Circuit's decision, which forms the legal baseline for the Supreme Court's potential review. The lower court found the agents' mistaken no-knock raid \"reasonable\" under *Maryland v. Garrison*, which was the linchpin for granting them qualified immunity. This finding had a cascading effect, leading to the dismissal of the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA) claims against the government. Specifically, the court applied the discretionary function exception to shield the government from negligence claims and, most critically, invoked the Supremacy Clause via its own *Kordash v. United States* precedent to bar intentional tort claims. The *Kordash* test immunizes the government if an agent's actions are tied to federal policy and are reasonably characterized as Fourth Amendment-compliant\u2014a standard the court felt was met by its qualified immunity analysis.\n\nMy prior hypothesis was that the petitioners, represented by the Institute for Justice, would attack this framework by arguing that the *Kordash* test improperly conflates the officer-specific qualified immunity standard with the distinct government liability standard under the FTCA. The successful location of the Petition for a Writ of Certiorari has confirmed the path to verifying this hypothesis. The latest observation, an internal reasoning step, does not add new substantive facts but clarifies my procedural state: the primary document needed to resolve my core uncertainty has been acquired but not yet analyzed. My task-level belief state has now fully transitioned from a search-and-discovery phase to a focused analysis phase. The immediate goal is to process the petition to extract the precise Questions Presented and the petitioners' arguments for why the *Kordash* test is flawed, likely by highlighting a circuit split or the national importance of preventing the FTCA's intentional tort waiver from being rendered meaningless.",
          "design_beliefs": "My design methodology has been validated and further refined through the recent sequence of actions. The core research cycle of **Plan -> Execute -> Synthesize/Review -> Refine Plan** remains the foundation of my approach. The success in locating the petition has provided powerful evidence for the effectiveness of my core heuristics:\n\n1.  **Prioritize Primary Sources:** The Petition for Certiorari remains the highest-value target, and its acquisition marks a major milestone.\n2.  **The Appendix Pivot:** This remains a valuable fallback strategy, though it was not needed in the final successful search.\n3.  **Leverage Metadata:** The role of counsel (Institute for Justice) continues to provide important context about the case's strategic framing.\n4.  **Refine Search Techniques:** This heuristic has been elevated from theory to proven best practice. The success of using precise `field_filters` (`'proceeding_title'`, `'link_name'`) in a structured database like a court docket demonstrates that targeted metadata queries are vastly superior to broad keyword searches for efficiency and accuracy.\n\nThe latest observation, a `THINK` action, introduces a crucial refinement to my understanding of the research cycle. It highlights the distinction between *data acquisition* and *knowledge synthesis*. Finding the document was the `Execute` step; the planned analysis is the `Synthesize` step. This leads to a new, more explicit heuristic: **Data is not knowledge.** The value of a retrieved document is only unlocked through a deliberate process of analysis and summarization that transforms raw information into actionable insights. The `THINK` action itself serves as a valuable tool, acting as a cognitive checkpoint between execution and synthesis, ensuring that the plan remains coherent and focused on resolving the most critical uncertainties before proceeding to the next information-gathering loop (e.g., searching for respondent briefs or amicus briefs). My refined cycle is now more accurately described as: **Plan -> Execute (Search) -> Synthesize (Analyze) -> Refine Plan**."

United States, 2022 \nWL 18263039 (N.D. Ga. Dec. 30, 2022), and the district \ncourt\u2019s original opinion, granting the government sum-\nmary judgment in part, Pet. App. 33a, is reported as \nMartin v. United States, 631 F. Supp. 3d 1281 (N.D. Ga. \n2022). \nJURISDICTION \nThe Eleventh Circuit entered its opinion below on \nApril 22, 2024, and denied rehearing on May 30. Justice \nThomas granted a 30-day extension of the period for fil-\ning a petition for a writ of certiorari. Petitioners timely \nfiled their petition on September 27 and invoked this \nCourt\u2019s jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. 1254(1). This Court \ngranted the petition on January 27, 2025. \nCONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY \nPROVISIONS INVOLVED \nThe Supremacy Clause of the United States Consti-\ntution provides: \nThis Constitution, and the Laws of the United \nStates which shall be made in Pursuance thereof; \nand all Treaties made, or which shall be made, un-\nder the Authority of the United States, shall be \nthe supreme Law of the Land; and the Judges in \n\n2 \n \n \nevery State shall be bound thereby, any Thing in \nthe Constitution or Laws of any State to the Con-\ntrary notwithstanding. \nU.S. Const. art. VI, cl. 2. \nOne such law of the United States is the Federal Tort \nClaims Act. It provides:  \nSubject to the provisions of chapter 171 of this ti-\ntle, the district courts  * * *  shall have exclusive \njurisdiction of civil actions on claims against the \nUnited States, for money damages  * * *  for in-\njury or loss of property, or personal injury or \ndeath caused by the negligent or wrongful act or \nomission of any employee of the Government \nwhile acting within the scope of his office or em-\nployment, under circumstances where the United \nStates, if a private person, would be liable to the \nclaimant in accordance with the law of the place \nwhere the act or omission occurred. \n28 U.S.C. 1346(b)(1). But: \nThe provisions of this chapter and section 1346(b) \nof this title shall not apply to\u2014 \n(a) Any claim based upon an act or omission of an \nemployee of the Government, exercising due \ncare, in the execution of a statute or regulation, \nwhether or not such statute or regulation be \nvalid, or based upon the exercise or performance \nor the failure to exercise or perform a discretion-\nary function or duty on the part of a federal \nagency or an employee of the Government, \nwhether or not the discretion involved be abused. \n\n3 \n \n \n* \n* \n* \n(h) Any claim arising out of assault, battery, false \nimprisonment, false arrest, malicious prosecu-\ntion, abuse of process, libel, slander, misrepresen-\ntation, deceit, or interference with contract \nrights: Provided, That, with regard to acts or \nomissions of investigative or law enforcement of-\nficers of the United States Government, the pro-\nvisions of this chapter and section 1346(b) of this \ntitle shall apply to any claim arising  * * *  out of \nassault, battery, false imprisonment, false arrest, \nabuse of process, or malicious prosecution. For \nthe purpose of this subsection, \u201cinvestigative or \nlaw enforcement officer\u201d means any officer of the \nUnited States who is empowered by law to exe-\ncute searches, to seize evidence, or to make ar-\nrests for violations of Federal law. \n28 U.S.C. 2680(a), (h).  \n \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nPetitioners are the innocent victims of an FBI \nwrong-house raid, during which federal law enforce-\nment officers committed assault, battery, and false im-\nprisonment. Congress amended the Federal Tort Claims \nAct to permit individuals like Petitioners to bring these \nclaims through the law-enforcement proviso. 28 U.S.C. \n2680(h); Carlson v. Green, 446 U.S. 14, 19\u201320 (1980). Yet \nthe Eleventh Circuit dismissed Petitioners\u2019 claims, rein-\nstating the sovereign immunity Congress waived \nthrough the FTCA. \nThis incongruous result grows from a distortion of \nthe separation of powers. As this Court recently ex-\n\n4 \n \n \nplained, \u201ccreating a cause of action is a legislative en-\ndeavor\u201d because \u201cCongress is far more competent than \nthe Judiciary to weigh [] policy considerations.\u201d Egbert \nv. Boule, 596 U.S. 482, 491 (2022) (cleaned up). Through \nthe law-enforcement proviso, Congress did just that.\n1 \nBut the lower courts have overridden the legislature\u2019s \nprerogative by restricting or\u2014as here\u2014outright bar-\nring the cause of action Congress provided. In the pro-\ncess, they have undermined our constitutional structure \nand created statutory conflict where none exists. \nThis Court has never found any overlap between the \nlaw-enforcement proviso, 28 U.S.C. 2680(h), and the dis-\ncretionary-function exception, 28 U.S.C. 2680(a). While \nthis exception reclaims sovereign immunity from the \nFTCA when claims are based on policy functions, the \nproviso waives sovereign immunity for certain inten-\ntional torts committed by law enforcement officers, \nwhich do not require courts to consider policy at all. Yet \nmost circuit courts have concluded that the provisions \nconflict, and all but one have resolved the conflict in fa-\nvor of the exception. \nThis is wrong for two reasons: First, the discretion-\nary-function exception reaches only acts authorized by \nan established agency policy. It does not reach common-\nlaw torts committed outside agency policy. Properly \n \n1 See Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of Fed. Bureau of \nNarcotics, 403 U.S. 388, 421 (1971) (Burger, C.J., dissenting) (calling \n\u201cfor a workable remedy\u201d from Congress for \u201cerror and deliberate \nmisconduct by law enforcement officials\u201d); Butz v. Economou, 438 \nU.S. 478, 524 (1978) (Rehnquist, J., concurring in part) (\u201cCongress, \nmaking just these sorts of judgments  * * *  , has amended the Fed-\neral Tort Claims Act  * * *  to allow suits against the United States \non the basis of certain intentional torts[.]\u201d). \n\n5 \n \n \nunderstood, the exception addresses a class of conduct \nthat is categorically distinct from the class covered by \nthe intentional torts in the law-enforcement proviso. \nSecond, in the rare instance that the exception and pro-\nviso could conceivably intersect, the FTCA\u2019s text, struc-\nture, and history show that the proviso exempts its \nclaims from Section 2680\u2019s reinstatement of sovereign \nimmunity. \nThe Eleventh Circuit\u2014relying on the second reason \nabove\u2014is the only circuit to correctly conclude that the \ndiscretionary-function exception does not apply to law-\nenforcement proviso claims. Nguyen v. United States, \n556 F.3d 1244, 1257 (2009). But shortly after it did, the \ncircuit careened back in the wrong direction\u2014holding \nthat the Constitution\u2019s Supremacy Clause paradoxically \nprevents Congress from waiving sovereign immunity \nthrough a federal statute. See, e.g., Denson v. United \nStates, 574 F.3d 1318, 1348 (2009). \nThe Eleventh Circuit and its sister courts now find \nthemselves in territory uncharted by Congress. If vic-\ntims of a wrong-house raid cannot find a remedy under \nthe FTCA, the law-enforcement proviso is lost. This \nCourt should correct course. \nI. \nThe Federal Tort Claims Act waives sovereign \nimmunity for federal employees\u2019 tortious acts, \nincluding police raids. \nPassed in 1946, the Federal Tort Claims Act \u201cwas \nnot an isolated and spontaneous flash of congressional \ngenerosity.\u201d Feres v. United States, 340 U.S. 135, 139 \n(1950). Rather, the Act was \u201cthe culmination of a long \neffort to mitigate unjust consequences of sovereign \n\n6 \n \n \nimmunity from suit\u201d and address the \u201cmultiplying num-\nber of remediless wrongs  * * *  which would have been \nactionable if inflicted by an individual or a corporation \nbut remediless solely because their perpetrator was an \nofficer or employee of the Government.\u201d Id. at 139\u2013140.  \nTo accomplish these purposes, the FTCA provides a \nfederal cause of action for damages, \u201callow[ing] a plain-\ntiff to bring certain state-law tort suits against the Fed-\neral Government.\u201d Brownback v. King, 592 U.S. 209, \n210\u2013211 (2021). The Act includes a broad grant of juris-\ndiction and a broad waiver of sovereign immunity for \nclaims that satisfy six criteria: \nSubject to the provisions of chapter 171 of this ti-\ntle,\n[2] the district courts  * * *  shall have exclusive \njurisdiction of civil actions on claims [1] against \nthe United States, [2] for money damages,  * * *  \n[3] for injury or loss of property, or personal in-\njury or death [4] caused by the negligent or \nwrongful act or omission of any employee of the \nGovernment [5] while acting within the scope of \nhis office or employment, [6] under circumstances \nwhere the United States, if a private person, \nwould be liable to the claimant in accordance with \nthe law of the place where the act or omission oc-\ncurred. \n28 U.S.C. 1346(b)(1); see also FDIC v. Meyer, 510 U.S. \n471, 477 (1994); 28 U.S.C. 2674 (\u201cThe United States shall \nbe liable * * * in the same manner and to the same extent \nas a private individual under like circumstances[.]\u201d). \n\u201cAny claim\u201d that satisfies Section 1346(b)(1) may still \n \n2 Chapter 171 of Title 28 includes 28 U.S.C. 2671\u20132680. \n\n7 \n \n \nbe defeated by sovereign immunity, however, if it falls \nwithin the \u201cExceptions\u201d in Section 2680, for which \u201c[t]he \nprovisions of [chapter 171] and section 1346(b) of this ti-\ntle shall not apply[.]\u201d 28 U.S.C. 2680. These exceptions \nexclude from the FTCA\u2019s waiver of sovereign immunity \nthe 13 categories of claims listed in 28 U.S.C. 2680(a)\u2013\n(n).\n3  \nAmong these exceptions are the so-called discretion-\nary-function and intentional-torts exceptions,\n4 28 U.S.C. \n2680(a), (h). \nThe discretionary-function exception reinstates sov-\nereign immunity for \u201c[a]ny claim  * * *  based upon the \nexercise or performance or the failure to exercise or per-\nform a discretionary function or duty on the part of a \nfederal agency or an employee of the Government[.]\u201d 28 \nU.S.C. 2680(a). This discretionary-function exception \nprecludes claims for acts based on federal regulations, \nUnited States v. Gaubert, 499 U.S. 315, 324 (1991), or le-\ngally conferred discretion \u201cbased on considerations of \n \n3 In margin comments to the original 1946 enactment of the \nFTCA, the exceptions were described as: (a) (\u201cAct, etc., in execu-\ntion of statute.\u201d); (b) (\u201cLoss of letters, etc.\u201d); (c) (\u201cAssessment of \ntax, etc.\u201d); (d) (\u201cSuits in admiralty.\u201d); (e) ([no description]); \n(f) (\u201cQuarantine.\u201d); (g) (\u201cInjury to vessels, etc.\u201d [since repealed]); \n(h) (\u201cAssault, \netc.\u201d); \n(i) (\u201cFiscal \noperations \nof \nTreasury.\u201d); \n(j) (\u201cCombatant activities.\u201d); (k) (\u201cForeign country.\u201d); (l) (\u201cTVA.\u201d); \n(m) ([not in original Act]); (n) ([not in original Act]). Legislative Re-\norganization Act of 1946, Pub. L. No. 79-601, 60 Stat. 812, 845\u2013846 \n(1946). \n4 Neither shorthand description is apt. See United States v. \nGaubert, 499 U.S. 315, 324\u2013325 & n.7 (1991) (2680(a) includes some \nnon-discretionary acts and excludes some discretionary ones); \nLevin v. United States, 568 U.S. 503, 507 n.1 (2013) (2680(h) includes \nsome negligent acts and excludes some intentional ones). \n\n8 \n \n \npublic policy,\u201d id. at 322\u2013323 (cleaned up). For acts in the \nlatter category, just any discretion will not do. Because \nthe exception concerns policy judgments, there \u201care ob-\nviously discretionary acts\u201d that do not trigger the ex-\nception because they are not \u201cbased on the purposes \nthat [a] regulatory regime seeks to accomplish.\u201d Id. at \n325 n.7.  \nThe intentional-torts exception reinstates sovereign \nimmunity for \u201c[a]ny claim arising out of assault, battery, \nfalse imprisonment, false arrest, malicious prosecution, \nabuse of process, libel, slander, misrepresentation, de-\nceit, or interference with contract rights[.]\u201d 28 U.S.C. \n2680(h). This intentional-torts exception does not, how-\never, remove from the FTCA\u2019s waiver of sovereign im-\nmunity \u201call intentional torts, e.g., conversion and tres-\npass,\u201d and the exception also reinstates sovereign im-\nmunity for \u201ccertain torts, e.g., misrepresentation, that \nmay arise out of negligent conduct.\u201d Levin v.

Justice \nThomas granted a 30-day extension of the period for fil-\ning a petition for a writ of certiorari. Petitioners timely \nfiled their petition on September 27 and invoked this \nCourt\u2019s jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. 1254(1). This Court \ngranted the petition on January 27, 2025. \nCONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY \nPROVISIONS INVOLVED \nThe Supremacy Clause of the United States Consti-\ntution provides: \nThis Constitution, and the Laws of the United \nStates which shall be made in Pursuance thereof; \nand all Treaties made, or which shall be made, un-\nder the Authority of the United States, shall be \nthe supreme Law of the Land; and the Judges in \n\n2 \n \n \nevery State shall be bound thereby, any Thing in \nthe Constitution or Laws of any State to the Con-\ntrary notwithstanding. \nU.S. Const. art. VI, cl. 2. \nOne such law of the United States is the Federal Tort \nClaims Act. It provides:  \nSubject to the provisions of chapter 171 of this ti-\ntle, the district courts  * * *  shall have exclusive \njurisdiction of civil actions on claims against the \nUnited States, for money damages  * * *  for in-\njury or loss of property, or personal injury or \ndeath caused by the negligent or wrongful act or \nomission of any employee of the Government \nwhile acting within the scope of his office or em-\nployment, under circumstances where the United \nStates, if a private person, would be liable to the \nclaimant in accordance with the law of the place \nwhere the act or omission occurred. \n28 U.S.C. 1346(b)(1). But: \nThe provisions of this chapter and section 1346(b) \nof this title shall not apply to\u2014 \n(a) Any claim based upon an act or omission of an \nemployee of the Government, exercising due \ncare, in the execution of a statute or regulation, \nwhether or not such statute or regulation be \nvalid, or based upon the exercise or performance \nor the failure to exercise or perform a discretion-\nary function or duty on the part of a federal \nagency or an employee of the Government, \nwhether or not the discretion involved be abused. \n\n3 \n \n \n* \n* \n* \n(h) Any claim arising out of assault, battery, false \nimprisonment, false arrest, malicious prosecu-\ntion, abuse of process, libel, slander, misrepresen-\ntation, deceit, or interference with contract \nrights: Provided, That, with regard to acts or \nomissions of investigative or law enforcement of-\nficers of the United States Government, the pro-\nvisions of this chapter and section 1346(b) of this \ntitle shall apply to any claim arising  * * *  out of \nassault, battery, false imprisonment, false arrest, \nabuse of process, or malicious prosecution. For \nthe purpose of this subsection, \u201cinvestigative or \nlaw enforcement officer\u201d means any officer of the \nUnited States who is empowered by law to exe-\ncute searches, to seize evidence, or to make ar-\nrests for violations of Federal law. \n28 U.S.C. 2680(a), (h).  \n \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nPetitioners are the innocent victims of an FBI \nwrong-house raid, during which federal law enforce-\nment officers committed assault, battery, and false im-\nprisonment. Congress amended the Federal Tort Claims \nAct to permit individuals like Petitioners to bring these \nclaims through the law-enforcement proviso. 28 U.S.C. \n2680(h); Carlson v. Green, 446 U.S. 14, 19\u201320 (1980). Yet \nthe Eleventh Circuit dismissed Petitioners\u2019 claims, rein-\nstating the sovereign immunity Congress waived \nthrough the FTCA. \nThis incongruous result grows from a distortion of \nthe separation of powers. As this Court recently ex-\n\n4 \n \n \nplained, \u201ccreating a cause of action is a legislative en-\ndeavor\u201d because \u201cCongress is far more competent than \nthe Judiciary to weigh [] policy considerations.\u201d Egbert \nv. Boule, 596 U.S. 482, 491 (2022) (cleaned up). Through \nthe law-enforcement proviso, Congress did just that.\n1 \nBut the lower courts have overridden the legislature\u2019s \nprerogative by restricting or\u2014as here\u2014outright bar-\nring the cause of action Congress provided. In the pro-\ncess, they have undermined our constitutional structure \nand created statutory conflict where none exists. \nThis Court has never found any overlap between the \nlaw-enforcement proviso, 28 U.S.C. 2680(h), and the dis-\ncretionary-function exception, 28 U.S.C. 2680(a). While \nthis exception reclaims sovereign immunity from the \nFTCA when claims are based on policy functions, the \nproviso waives sovereign immunity for certain inten-\ntional torts committed by law enforcement officers, \nwhich do not require courts to consider policy at all. Yet \nmost circuit courts have concluded that the provisions \nconflict, and all but one have resolved the conflict in fa-\nvor of the exception. \nThis is wrong for two reasons: First, the discretion-\nary-function exception reaches only acts authorized by \nan established agency policy. It does not reach common-\nlaw torts committed outside agency policy. Properly \n \n1 See Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of Fed. Bureau of \nNarcotics, 403 U.S. 388, 421 (1971) (Burger, C.J., dissenting) (calling \n\u201cfor a workable remedy\u201d from Congress for \u201cerror and deliberate \nmisconduct by law enforcement officials\u201d); Butz v. Economou, 438 \nU.S. 478, 524 (1978) (Rehnquist, J., concurring in part) (\u201cCongress, \nmaking just these sorts of judgments  * * *  , has amended the Fed-\neral Tort Claims Act  * * *  to allow suits against the United States \non the basis of certain intentional torts[.]\u201d). \n\n5 \n \n \nunderstood, the exception addresses a class of conduct \nthat is categorically distinct from the class covered by \nthe intentional torts in the law-enforcement proviso. \nSecond, in the rare instance that the exception and pro-\nviso could conceivably intersect, the FTCA\u2019s text, struc-\nture, and history show that the proviso exempts its \nclaims from Section 2680\u2019s reinstatement of sovereign \nimmunity. \nThe Eleventh Circuit\u2014relying on the second reason \nabove\u2014is the only circuit to correctly conclude that the \ndiscretionary-function exception does not apply to law-\nenforcement proviso claims. Nguyen v. United States, \n556 F.3d 1244, 1257 (2009). But shortly after it did, the \ncircuit careened back in the wrong direction\u2014holding \nthat the Constitution\u2019s Supremacy Clause paradoxically \nprevents Congress from waiving sovereign immunity \nthrough a federal statute. See, e.g., Denson v. United \nStates, 574 F.3d 1318, 1348 (2009). \nThe Eleventh Circuit and its sister courts now find \nthemselves in territory uncharted by Congress. If vic-\ntims of a wrong-house raid cannot find a remedy under \nthe FTCA, the law-enforcement proviso is lost. This \nCourt should correct course. \nI. \nThe Federal Tort Claims Act waives sovereign \nimmunity for federal employees\u2019 tortious acts, \nincluding police raids. \nPassed in 1946, the Federal Tort Claims Act \u201cwas \nnot an isolated and spontaneous flash of congressional \ngenerosity.\u201d Feres v. United States, 340 U.S. 135, 139 \n(1950). Rather, the Act was \u201cthe culmination of a long \neffort to mitigate unjust consequences of sovereign \n\n6 \n \n \nimmunity from suit\u201d and address the \u201cmultiplying num-\nber of remediless wrongs  * * *  which would have been \nactionable if inflicted by an individual or a corporation \nbut remediless solely because their perpetrator was an \nofficer or employee of the Government.\u201d Id. at 139\u2013140.  \nTo accomplish these purposes, the FTCA provides a \nfederal cause of action for damages, \u201callow[ing] a plain-\ntiff to bring certain state-law tort suits against the Fed-\neral Government.\u201d Brownback v. King, 592 U.S. 209, \n210\u2013211 (2021). The Act includes a broad grant of juris-\ndiction and a broad waiver of sovereign immunity for \nclaims that satisfy six criteria: \nSubject to the provisions of chapter 171 of this ti-\ntle,\n[2] the district courts  * * *  shall have exclusive \njurisdiction of civil actions on claims [1] against \nthe United States, [2] for money damages,  * * *  \n[3] for injury or loss of property, or personal in-\njury or death [4] caused by the negligent or \nwrongful act or omission of any employee of the \nGovernment [5] while acting within the scope of \nhis office or employment, [6] under circumstances \nwhere the United States, if a private person, \nwould be liable to the claimant in accordance with \nthe law of the place where the act or omission oc-\ncurred. \n28 U.S.C. 1346(b)(1); see also FDIC v. Meyer, 510 U.S. \n471, 477 (1994); 28 U.S.C. 2674 (\u201cThe United States shall \nbe liable * * * in the same manner and to the same extent \nas a private individual under like circumstances[.]\u201d). \n\u201cAny claim\u201d that satisfies Section 1346(b)(1) may still \n \n2 Chapter 171 of Title 28 includes 28 U.S.C. 2671\u20132680. \n\n7 \n \n \nbe defeated by sovereign immunity, however, if it falls \nwithin the \u201cExceptions\u201d in Section 2680, for which \u201c[t]he \nprovisions of [chapter 171] and section 1346(b) of this ti-\ntle shall not apply[.]\u201d 28 U.S.C. 2680. These exceptions \nexclude from the FTCA\u2019s waiver of sovereign immunity \nthe 13 categories of claims listed in 28 U.S.C. 2680(a)\u2013\n(n).\n3  \nAmong these exceptions are the so-called discretion-\nary-function and intentional-torts exceptions,\n4 28 U.S.C. \n2680(a), (h). \nThe discretionary-function exception reinstates sov-\nereign immunity for \u201c[a]ny claim  * * *  based upon the \nexercise or performance or the failure to exercise or per-\nform a discretionary function or duty on the part of a \nfederal agency or an employee of the Government[.]\u201d 28 \nU.S.C. 2680(a). This discretionary-function exception \nprecludes claims for acts based on federal regulations, \nUnited States v. Gaubert, 499 U.S. 315, 324 (1991), or le-\ngally conferred discretion \u201cbased on considerations of \n \n3 In margin comments to the original 1946 enactment of the \nFTCA, the exceptions were described as: (a) (\u201cAct, etc., in execu-\ntion of statute.\u201d); (b) (\u201cLoss of letters, etc.\u201d); (c) (\u201cAssessment of \ntax, etc.\u201d); (d) (\u201cSuits in admiralty.\u201d); (e) ([no description]); \n(f) (\u201cQuarantine.\u201d); (g) (\u201cInjury to vessels, etc.\u201d [since repealed]); \n(h) (\u201cAssault, \netc.\u201d); \n(i) (\u201cFiscal \noperations \nof \nTreasury.\u201d); \n(j) (\u201cCombatant activities.\u201d); (k) (\u201cForeign country.\u201d); (l) (\u201cTVA.\u201d); \n(m) ([not in original Act]); (n) ([not in original Act]). Legislative Re-\norganization Act of 1946, Pub. L. No. 79-601, 60 Stat. 812, 845\u2013846 \n(1946). \n4 Neither shorthand description is apt. See United States v. \nGaubert, 499 U.S. 315, 324\u2013325 & n.7 (1991) (2680(a) includes some \nnon-discretionary acts and excludes some discretionary ones); \nLevin v. United States, 568 U.S. 503, 507 n.1 (2013) (2680(h) includes \nsome negligent acts and excludes some intentional ones). \n\n8 \n \n \npublic policy,\u201d id. at 322\u2013323 (cleaned up). For acts in the \nlatter category, just any discretion will not do. Because \nthe exception concerns policy judgments, there \u201care ob-\nviously discretionary acts\u201d that do not trigger the ex-\nception because they are not \u201cbased on the purposes \nthat [a] regulatory regime seeks to accomplish.\u201d Id. at \n325 n.7.  \nThe intentional-torts exception reinstates sovereign \nimmunity for \u201c[a]ny claim arising out of assault, battery, \nfalse imprisonment, false arrest, malicious prosecution, \nabuse of process, libel, slander, misrepresentation, de-\nceit, or interference with contract rights[.]\u201d 28 U.S.C. \n2680(h). This intentional-torts exception does not, how-\never, remove from the FTCA\u2019s waiver of sovereign im-\nmunity \u201call intentional torts, e.g., conversion and tres-\npass,\u201d and the exception also reinstates sovereign im-\nmunity for \u201ccertain torts, e.g., misrepresentation, that \nmay arise out of negligent conduct.\u201d Levin v. United \nStates, 568 U.S. 503, 507 n.1 (2013) (citing United States \nv. Neustadt, 366 U.S. 696, 702 (1961)); see also United \nStates v. Shearer, 473 U.S. 52, 55 (1985) (plurality opin-\nion) (noting that 2680(h) covers claims that \u201csound in \nnegligence but stem from a battery\u201d). \nIn 1974, Congress amended the FTCA in response to \na pair of federal wrong-house raids in Collinsville, Illi-\nnois, that made national news the year before.\n5 This \n \n5 See, e.g., Andrew H. Malcolm, Drug Raids Terrorize 2 Fami-\nlies\u2014by Mistake, N.Y. Times (Apr. 29, 1973); Linda Eardley, Drug \nAgents Sued After Raid on Home, St. Louis Post-Dispatch (Apr. \n25, 1973); Dennis Montgomery, The Night of Terror: \u201cWe Made a \nMistake\u201d, Wash. Post (Apr. 30, 1973); see also 119 Cong. Rec. 23217, \n23242\u201323258 (1973) (cataloging news reports); Hearings on \n \n\n9 \n \n \namendment added the law-enforcement proviso to the \nFTCA. Act to Amend Reorganization Plan No. 2 of 1973, \nPub. L. No. 93-253, 88 Stat. 50 (1974). The proviso is an \nexception to the FTCA\u2019s exceptions. It re-waives the \nsovereign immunity otherwise reinstated in Section \n2680 \u201cto create a cause of action against the United \nStates for intentional torts committed by federal law en-\nforcement officers.\u201d Carlson, 446 U.S. at 19\u201320. The pro-\nviso is located in Section 2680(h), which provides: \nThe provisions of this chapter and section 1346(b) \nof this title shall not apply to\u2014 \n* \n* \n* \n(h) Any claim arising out of assault, battery, false \nimprisonment, false arrest, malicious prosecu-\ntion, abuse of process, libel, slander, misrepresen-\ntation, deceit, or interference with contract \nrights: Provided, That, with regard to acts or \nomissions of investigative or law enforcement of-\nficers of the United States Government, the pro-\nvisions of this chapter and section 1346(b) of this \ntitle shall apply to any claim arising  * * *  out of \nassault, battery, false imprisonment, false arrest, \nabuse of process, or malicious prosecution. For \nthe purpose of this subsection, \u201cinvestigative or \nlaw enforcement officer\u201d means any officer of the \n \nReorganization Plan No. 2 of 1973 before the Subcomm. on Reor-\nganization, Rsch., and Int\u2019l Organizations of the S. Comm. on Gov\u2019t \nOperations, 93d Cong., 1st Sess., pt. 3, at 461\u2013483 (1973) (testimony \nfrom victims of Collinsville raids); see also generally John C. Boger \net al., The Federal Tort Claims Act Intentional Torts Amendment, \n54 N.C. L. Rev. 497, 499\u2013517 (1976). \n \n\n10 \n \n \nUnited States who is empowered by law to exe-\ncute searches, to seize evidence, or to make ar-\nrests for violations of Federal law. \nSee also Millbrook v. United States, 569 U.S. 50, 54 \n(2013) (assembling Section 2680(h) as above, less the fi-\nnal sentence). \nThe point of the proviso is to ensure that \u201cinnocent \nindividuals who are subjected to raids [of the type con-\nducted in Collinsville and Bivens] will have a cause of \naction against  * * *  the Federal Government.\u201d Carlson, \n446 U.S. at 20 (quoting S. Rep. No. 93-588, at 3 (1973)).  \nThe Senate Report cited in Carlson clarifies the pro-\nviso\u2019s operation. Although public outrage toward the \nCollinsville raids spurred Congress to act, it did not \ncabin the proviso to the facts\u2014or the torts\u2014at issue in \nthose raids. See S. Rep. 93-588, at 3\u20134. Instead, the lan-\nguage Congress enacted provides a remedy for a swath \nof tortious conduct by federal law enforcement officers \nthat the FTCA could not otherwise address due to its \nintentional-torts exception. See id. at 1 (explaining that \nthe purpose of the bill containing the proviso was \u201cto \nprovide a remedy against the United States for the in-\ntentional torts of its investigative and law enforcement \nofficers\u201d). \nTo achieve this purpose, Congress (in conjunction \nwith the Department of Justice) crafted the proviso  as \na statutory \u201ccounterpart to  * * *  Bivens\u201d that extends \nbeyond \u201cconstitutional tort situations[.]\u201d S. Rep. 93-588, \nat 3\u20134; see also Carlson, 446 U.S. at 20 (\u201cCongress views \nFTCA and Bivens as parallel, complementary causes of \naction[.]\u201d). When the proviso was enacted, both the leg-\nislative and executive branches understood it to \u201csubmit \n\n11 \n \n \nthe Government to liability\u201d in \u201cany case in which a Fed-\neral law enforcement agent commit[s]\u201d an enumerated \n\u201ctort while acting within the scope of his employment or \nunder color of Federal law.\u201d S. Rep. 93-588, at 4. \nThis case presents quintessential proviso claims. \nII. \nThe FBI raided an innocent family\u2019s home. \nIn suburban Atlanta sits a house at 3756 Denville \nTrace. Built on a quarter-acre lot in 2000, the four-bed-\nroom, three-bathroom home has an attached two-car \ngarage, tasteful landscaping, and a manicured lawn. In \n2017, it was home to a family: Petitioners, Hilliard Toi \nCliatt; his partner, Curtrina Martin; and her seven-year-\nold son, G.W. \nBefore dawn on October 18, 2017, FBI Special Agent \nLawrence Guerra led a six-agent SWAT team to 3756 \nDenville Trace. J.A. 4, 21. Failing to confirm the address \nclearly visible on the mailbox, Guerra mistakenly be-\nlieved he had arrived at 3741 Landau Lane\u2014the home \nof gang member Joseph Riley and the address for which \nGuerra had a search warrant. Guerra knew that the tar-\nget house had its address on the mailbox. He also knew \nthat neither Riley nor his associates were known to \ndrive a black Camaro; yet when Guerra saw a black Ca-\nmaro in Petitioners\u2019 driveway that morning, he used the \ncar as a landmark for his team to identify their target. \nPet. App. 3a\u20135a, 7a, 38a & n.3. \nIgnoring these and other conspicuous features that \nwould have averted their mistake, the heavily armed \nSWAT team smashed in the front door of 3756 Denville \nTrace with a battering ram, detonated a flashbang gre-\nnade in the home\u2019s entryway, and rushed inside. Pet. \n\n12 \n \n \nApp. 7a\u20138a; J.A. 5, 22. \nThe explosion startled Petitioners awake. The family \nimmediately believed criminals were invading their \nhome. Martin\u2019s first instinct was to run to her son\u2019s room \nto shield him from the intruders, but Cliatt, acting to \nprotect his partner, grabbed Martin and pulled her into \na walk-in closet. Meanwhile, seven-year-old G.W. hid un-\nder his covers, as his mother screamed, \u201cI need to go get \nmy son,  * * *  I need to go get my son.\u201d Pet. App. 8a, \n39a, 76a\u201377a, 88a; J.A. 5\u20136, 22\u201323. \nMasked FBI agents shoved open the door to the \ncloset where Cliatt and Martin had barricaded them-\nselves. Agents dragged Cliatt out and handcuffed him. \nAnd Martin\u2014half naked\u2014fell to the floor in front of a \nroom full of hostile strangers. As Martin pleaded with \none of the agents to let her see her son, the SWAT team \npointed guns at her and Cliatt. Pet. App. 8a, 88a\u201389a; \nJ.A. 5\u20136, 22\u201323. \nThe agents aggressively questioned Cliatt. But \nwhen he told them his address\u20143756 Denville Trace\u2014\n\u201call the noise just ended.\u201d Pet. App. 8a, 79a. Realizing \nthe SWAT team had raided the wrong house, Agent \nGuerra allowed Cliatt to stand up, unshackled him, and \nsaid, \u201cI\u2019ll be right back.\u201d Id. at 9a, 79a\u201380a; see also J.A. \n7, 24. \nGuerra and his team then went down the block to \n3741 Landau Lane, where they conducted another raid \nat the correct address. Guerra returned to 3756 Denville \nTrace, apologized, documented the property damage he \ncaused, handed Cliatt a business card with his supervi-\nsor\u2019s information, and left the family in stunned disbe-\nlief. Pet. App. 9a, 82a\u201383a. \n\n13 \n \n \n* \n* \n* \nGuerra would later claim that, while he had input \n\u201c3741 Landau Lane\u201d into his GPS, it had directed him to \n3756 Denville Trace instead. But Guerra could not prove \nthis\u2014he threw the GPS away before Petitioners could \nexamine it in discovery. Pet. App. 6a, 9a, 40a\u201341a. \nIII. \nThe lower courts granted the government sov-\nereign immunity for the wrong-house raid. \n1. Petitioners sued the United States under the \nFTCA for the tortious acts of the FBI agents who raided \ntheir home, pleading five counts.\n6 Pet. App. 60a; J.A. 8\u2013\n14, 25\u201330. Citing the discretionary-function exception, \n28 U.S.C. 2680(a), the government moved for summary \njudgment. The district court granted it in part. Pet. App. \n67a. \nThe district court applied Eleventh Circuit prece-\ndent holding that the discretionary-function exception \ndoes not bar claims that fall within the FTCA\u2019s law-en-\nforcement proviso. See Nguyen, 556 F.3d at 1260 \n(\u201c[W]here  * * *  the \u00a7 2680(h) proviso applies to waive \nsovereign immunity, the exception to waiver contained \nin \u00a7 2680(a) is of no effect.\u201d). So the court broke Petition-\ners\u2019 FTCA claims into two groups: four proviso claims \n \n6 Martin and G.W. filed suit separately from Cliatt, but the dis-\ntrict court consolidated the cases. Petitioners also asserted a claim \nagainst Guerra under Bivens, but the Eleventh Circuit granted \nGuerra qualified immunity on the basis that \u201cthe law at the time did \nnot clearly establish that Guerra\u2019s preparatory steps before the \nwarrant execution would violate the Fourth Amendment.\u201d Pet. \nApp. 15a. The questions before the Court concern only Petitioners\u2019 \nFTCA claims. \n\n14 \n \n \n(false arrest, false imprisonment, assault, and battery, \nJ.A. 8\u201310, 25\u201327) and three non-proviso claims (negli-\ngence, trespass, and infliction of emotional distress, J.A. \n10\u201314, 27\u201330). Pet. App. 59a\u201360a. \nThe district court denied summary judgment for \nthree of the four proviso claims. It held that the record \ndid not support a claim for false arrest, Pet. App. 63a, \nbut did support a claim for false imprisonment because \nthe record \u201cshows that the 3741 Landau and Riley war-\nrants were void as to Plaintiffs, and defendants have not \ndemonstrated that the arrest was otherwise legal,\u201d id. \nat 65a. Petitioners\u2019 assault and battery claims likewise \ncould proceed because the FBI agents had unlawfully \ntouched Petitioners. Id. at 65a\u201367a.  \nBut the district court granted summary judgment on \nthe non-proviso claims under the discretionary-function \nexception. Because \u201cGuerra\u2019s efforts in preparing to ex-\necute the warrant at 3741 Landau involved judgment \nand choice\u201d and \u201cno statute, regulation or even internal \noperating procedure prescrib[ed] Guerra\u2019s course of ac-\ntion,\u201d the district court concluded that his decision \u201cin-\nvolve[d] policy considerations and should not be subject \nto judicial second-guessing.\u201d Pet. App. 57a\u201358a (cita-\ntions omitted). \n2. A month after the district court allowed Petition-\ners\u2019 proviso claims to proceed, the Eleventh Circuit is-\nsued Kordash v. United States, 51 F.4th 1289 (11th Cir. \n2022). Kordash extended earlier circuit precedent hold-\ning that the Supremacy Clause bars an FTCA claim if \nthe government employee\u2019s acts had \u201csome nexus with \nfurthering federal policy\u201d and could \u201creasonably be \ncharacterized as complying with the full range of federal \nlaw.\u201d Id. at 1293\u20131294 (quoting Denson, 574 F.3d at \n\n15 \n \n \n1348).  \nThe government moved for reconsideration based on \nKordash (though it had not raised the Supremacy \nClause as an affirmative defense), and the district court \ngranted it. Pet. App. 25a. \u201cBecause Guerra was acting \nwithin the scope of his discretionary duty, and his ac-\ntions did not violate the Fourth Amendment,\u201d the dis-\ntrict court concluded that the Supremacy Clause barred \nPetitioners\u2019 remaining FTCA claims. Id. at 27a.  \n3. Petitioners appealed, but the Eleventh Circuit af-\nfirmed. Like the district court, the circuit court sepa-\nrated Petitioners\u2019 proviso and non-proviso claims. It \nthen held that the discretionary-function exception \nbarred the non-proviso claims and the Supremacy \nClause barred the proviso claims. \nAccording to the circuit court, \u201c[t]he discretionary \nfunction exception applies unless a source of federal law \n\u2018specifically prescribes\u2019 a course of conduct.\u201d Pet. App. \n16a (quoting Shivers v. United States, 1 F.4th 924, 931 \n(11th Cir. 2021)). No federal prescription existed here, \nthe court found, because \u201cthe FBI did not have stringent \npolicies or procedures in place that dictate how agents \nare to prepare for warrant executions.\u201d Pet. App. 17a\u2013\n18a; id. at 18a (\u201c[T]he preparatory actions Guerra took \nbefore the warrant execution\u201d were \u201c\u2018susceptible to pol-\nicy analysis.\u2019\u201d (citation omitted)). \u201cAlthough it is unfor-\ntunate that  * * *  Guerra executed the warrant at the \nwrong house,\u201d the court concluded, \u201chis actions, never-\ntheless, \u2018fall squarely within the discretionary function \nexception.\u2019\u201d Id. at 18a (quoting Shivers, 1 F.4th at 929). \nAs for Petitioners\u2019 proviso claims, the court ex-\nplained that, \u201c[s]imilar to the discretionary function \n\n16 \n \n \nexception, the Supremacy Clause ensures that states do \nnot impede or burden the execution of federal law.\u201d Pet. \nApp. 16a\u201317a (citing Denson, 574 F.3d at 1336\u20131337). \nBecause Guerra \u201cacted within the scope of his discre-\ntionary authority\u201d in conducting the raid and was other-\nwise entitled to qualified immunity, the court held that \nthe Supremacy Clause foreclosed Petitioners\u2019 proviso \nclaims. Pet. App. 19a. \n4. The Eleventh Circuit denied rehearing, and Peti-\ntioners requested this Court\u2019s review. Although, in the \ngovernment\u2019s view, the Eleventh Circuit answers both \nquestions presented incorrectly, the government op-\nposed certiorari. BIO at 8, 21\u201322. Because it believes the \ndecision below \u201ccorrectly held that petitioners\u2019 claims \nare barred, and no court of appeals  * * *  would have \nreached a different result,\u201d the government argued that \nthe Court should deny review. Id. at 8.  \nThis Court granted the petition. \nSUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT \nThe Court should restore the will of Congress ex-\npressed in the text of the FTCA and eliminate the \njudge-made exceptions that bar recovery for proviso \nclaims\u2014here, assault, battery, and false imprisonment. \nCongress originally excluded intentional torts, like \nassault and battery, from the FTCA. But after the Col-\nlinsville raids, Congress reversed course. Through the \nlaw-enforcement proviso, Congress waived sovereign \nimmunity for certain intentional torts by law enforce-\nment officers. Congress meant what it said in the pro-\nviso, and neither the discretionary-function exception \n\n17 \n \n \nnor the Supremacy Clause stands in the way.\n7 \nI. The discretionary-function exception is categori-\ncally inapplicable to claims arising under the law-en-\nforcement proviso. Over the years, however, lower \ncourts have expanded the discretionary-function excep-\ntion, creating conflict with the proviso where none ex-\nists. These interpretations have strayed so far from the \nFTCA\u2019s text that even claims arising out of a wrong-\nhouse raid\u2014the exact scenario Congress created the \nproviso to address\u2014are now excluded.  \nThe Court can solve the problem in one of two ways: \nFirst, by holding that the sort of claims that arise under \nthe proviso do not implicate the discretionary-function \nexception. Second, by holding that the proviso removes \nits claims from Section 2680\u2019s reinstatement of sover-\neign immunity. \nA. The law-enforcement proviso and discretionary-\nfunction exception do not conflict. The former waives \nsovereign immunity for ordinary common-law torts \ncommitted by law enforcement officers that are not \nbased on policy. The latter reinstates sovereign immun-\nity to prevent judicial policy-making via tort suits, with \nparticular \u201cemphasis upon protection for regulatory ac-\ntivities[.]\u201d United States v. Varig Airlines, 467 U.S. 797, \n814 (1984). Both the statutory text and this Court\u2019s \ncases interpreting it emphasize the exception\u2019s regula-\ntory nature. Indeed, this Court has never observed the \n \n7 Petitioners address the questions presented in reverse order \nbecause the government has declined to defend the first question \npresented and because we believe, following the Court\u2019s refinement \nof the second question presented, the issues flow more logically in \nthis order. \n\n18 \n \n \ndiscretionary-function exception to overlap with the in-\ntentional-torts exception, let alone the law-enforcement \nproviso. \nB. If the provisions did conflict, the law-enforcement \nproviso should prevail for six reasons. (1) The proviso\u2019s \ntext expressly negates the reinstatement of sovereign \nimmunity in Section 2680\u2019s preamble. The preamble pro-\nvides that the FTCA \u201cshall not apply\u201d to certain claims, \nbut the proviso retorts that the FTCA \u201cshall apply\u201d to \nclaims arising out of it. (2) Similarly, unlike the definition \nof \u201cinvestigative or law enforcement officer\u201d in Section \n2680(h), the proviso does not just apply \u201cfor the purpose \nof this subsection.\u201d The proviso (3) is more specific and \n(4) was enacted more recently than the exception. (5) \nApplying the exception (as interpreted by the lower \ncourts) to proviso claims would undermine the proviso \nin its core applications. (6) It would also defeat the \nFTCA\u2019s order of operation, which gives the proviso the \nlast word. \nII. The Supremacy Clause cannot restrict legislative \nenactments of Congress. The Eleventh Circuit\u2019s holding \nto the contrary upends our constitutional design. In the \nFTCA, Congress incorporated state tort elements into \nfederal law. This incorporation means that there can be \nno conflict between federal employees\u2019 actions that have \n\u201csome nexus with furthering federal policy\u201d and an ac-\ntual federal law\u2014the FTCA\u2014that waives immunity for \nmany of those actions. But the Eleventh Circuit created \nan exception to Congress\u2019s power to determine the law \nof the land in the name of preserving that power. The \nCourt should make sure that the legislative prerogative \nstays with Congress. \n\n19 \n \n \nARGUMENT \nWhile executing a raid at the wrong house, federal \nlaw enforcement officers subjected Petitioners to as-\nsault, battery, and false imprisonment. These claims fall \nsquarely within the FTCA\u2019s law-enforcement proviso \nthat Congress enacted to provide a remedy for federal \nwrong-house raids. On this point, the statutory text is \nunmistakable: \n[W]ith regard to acts or omissions of investiga-\ntive or law enforcement officers of the United \nStates Government, [the FTCA] shall apply to \nany claim arising  * * *  out of assault, battery, \nfalse imprisonment, false arrest, abuse of process, \nor malicious prosecution.  \n28 U.S.C. 2680(h). \nAt the government\u2019s urging, however, the lower \ncourts have effectively read the law-enforcement pro-\nviso out of the FTCA. We offer the Court several paths \nto restore the cause of action Congress enacted. \nI. \nThe discretionary-function exception is cate-\ngorically inapplicable to claims arising out of \nthe law-enforcement proviso. \nCongress designed the FTCA \u201cto remove the sover-\neign immunity of the United States from suits in tort \nand, with certain specific exceptions, to render the Gov-\nernment liable in tort as a private individual would be \nunder like circumstances.\u201d Richards v. United States, \n369 U.S. 1, 6 (1962); 28 U.S.C. 1346(b)(1), 2680. Two ex-\nceptions are relevant here: the discretionary-function \nexception, 28 U.S.C. 2680(a); and the intentional-torts \n\n20 \n \n \nexception, 28 U.S.C. 2680(h). Both have been part of the \nFTCA since its original enactment in 1946. Legislative \nReorganization Act of 1946, Pub. L. No. 79-601, 60 Stat. \n812, 845\u2013846 (1946).  \nThese exceptions serve different purposes. Through \nthe discretionary-function exception, \u201cCongress wished \nto prevent judicial \u2018second-guessing\u2019 of legislative and \nadministrative decisions grounded in social, economic, \nand political policy through the medium of an action in \ntort.\u201d Varig Airlines, 467 U.S. at 814. At its core, the ex-\nception shields against tort suits that can be resolved \nonly by forcing the judiciary to assess \u201cthe validity of \nlegislation or discretionary administrative action,\u201d like \ndecisions \u201cof a regulatory nature,\u201d \u201cthe expenditure of \nFederal funds,\u201d or \u201cthe execution of a Federal pro-\nject[.]\u201d Dalehite v. United States, 346 U.S. 15, 27 (1953) \n(citation omitted).  \n\u201cOn the other hand, the common law torts of employ-\nees of regulatory agencies, as well as of other Federal \nagencies,\u201d are \u201cwithin the scope of\u201d the FTCA. Varig \nAirlines, 467 U.S. at 810 (citation omitted). These \u201cordi-\nnary common-law torts\u201d were \u201c[u]ppermost in the col-\nlective mind of Congress\u201d when it passed the FTCA. \nDalehite, 346 U.S. at 28 & n.19.  \nStill, Congress did not permit all such torts. To pre-\nclude recovery for certain intentional torts, Congress \nenacted the intentional-torts exception, 28 U.S.C. \n2680(h), which was designed to cover, among others, \nclaims \u201cwhere some agent of the Government gets in a \nfight with some fellow . . . [a]nd socks him.\u201d Shearer, 473 \nU.S. at 55 (citation omitted).  \nBut after the Collinsville raids, Congress saw the \n\n21 \n \n \nerror of its ways: If a federal law enforcement officer \ndoes tortiously sock a fellow, it is only right that the gov-\nernment should provide a remedy. So Congress \namended the FTCA to revive certain intentional-tort \nclaims arising out of \u201cdeliberate attacks\u201d by federal po-\nlice. Shearer, 473 U.S. at 55. This amendment\u2014the law-\nenforcement proviso\u2014\u201cextends the waiver of sovereign \nimmunity\u201d to claims for \u201c\u2018acts or omissions of investiga-\ntive or law enforcement officers.\u2019\u201d Millbrook, 569 U.S. at \n52\u201353 (quoting 28 U.S.C. 2680(h)).  \nRead together, the FTCA plays out like a tennis \npoint: Sovereign immunity applies when the govern-\nment serves. If a plaintiff can return the ball with Sec-\ntion 1346(b) (waiving immunity), she may be able to \nscore. If, however, the government can volley back with \nSection 2680 (reinstating immunity), the plaintiff loses\u2014\nunless the law-enforcement proviso allows her to send \nthe ball back across the net (re-waiving immunity). The \nremainder of the point plays out like a typical tort suit. \nBut the lower courts have thrown out the rules. They \nhave expanded the discretionary-function exception be-\nyond its text and purpose.\n8 As a result, the courts have \ncreated an unnecessary and unjustified conflict within \nSection 2680.  \nThe Court has two paths to fix this problem: It can \nrestore the proper balance to the FTCA by clarifying \nthat, properly understood, the discretionary-function \nexception and the law-enforcement proviso address \n \n8 The different ways in which the circuits have expanded the \ndiscretionary-function exception are the subject of multiple circuit \nsplits. See Xi v. Haugen, 68 F.4th 824, 843 (3d Cir. 2023) (Bibas, J., \nconcurring). \n\n22 \n \n \ncategorically different classes of acts, so the exception \ndoes not bear on the proviso. See Part I(A), infra. Or the \nCourt could adopt a straightforward textual analysis un-\nder which the proviso overrides the discretionary-func-\ntion exception if the two conflict. See Part I(B), infra. \nBoth paths lead to the same outcome in this case: Pe-\ntitioners\u2019 claims arising out of the assault, battery, and \nfalse imprisonment that Agent Guerra and his SWAT \nteam committed as they reenacted the Collinsville raids \nmust be allowed to proceed under the proviso Congress \nenacted to permit these exact claims. \nA. Claims based on discretionary functions do \nnot arise out of the law-enforcement pro-\nviso. \nAfter decades of consideration, the Court has never \nsuggested that the discretionary-function exception, \nSection 2680(a), and the law-enforcement proviso, Sec-\ntion 2680(h), overlap. This is because Sections 2680(a) \nand (h) address categorically distinct claims. And any in-\nterplay that may exist disappears entirely when the \nclaims are limited to those in the proviso.   \ni. \nThe exception does not reach intentional \ntorts like those the proviso permits. \nTo understand why the discretionary-function ex-\nception is inapplicable to claims arising out of the law-\nenforcement proviso, we must understand both provi-\nsions. So we \u201cstart with the text of the statute[.]\u201d Babb \nv. Wilkie, 589 U.S. 399, 404 (2020). \n1. The text of the law-enforcement proviso. Under \nthe intentional-torts exception, the FTCA \u201cshall not \n\n23 \n \n \napply\u201d to: \nAny claim arising out of assault, battery, false im-\nprisonment, false arrest, malicious prosecution, \nabuse of process, libel, slander, misrepresenta-\ntion, deceit, or interference with contract \nrights[.] \nProvided, however, the FTCA \u201cshall apply\u201d to \u201cany \nclaim arising  * * *  out of assault, battery, false impris-\nonment, false arrest, abuse of process, or malicious pros-\necution,\u201d \u201cwith regard to acts or omissions of investiga-\ntive or law enforcement officers of the United States \nGovernment.\u201d 28 U.S.C. 2680(h). \nThis proviso re-waives sovereign immunity. Its lan-\nguage is comprehensive and mandatory: The FTCA \nshall apply to the specified claims if committed by a fed-\neral police officer. Congress created the proviso after \nthe Collinsville raids exposed a gap in the law: While the \nFTCA waived sovereign immunity if a \u201cmail truck \ndriver  * * *  negligently runs down a citizen on the \nstreet[, ]the Federal Government is held harmless if a \nfederal narcotics agent intentionally assaults that same \ncitizen in the course of an illegal \u2018no-knock\u2019 raid.\u201d S. Rep. \n93-588, at 3.  \nCongress placed the proviso in 2680(h)\u2014the inten-\ntional-torts exception. This structural choice communi-\ncates that Congress understood 2680(h) to be the barrier \nto liability, not just for whatever remains after the dis-\ncretionary-function exception is applied, but every time \nlaw enforcement officers \u201cact under color of law so as to \ninjure the public through search[es] and seizures[.]\u201d S. \nRep. 93-588, at 4; see Cope v. Cope, 137 U.S. 682, 688\u2013\n689 (1891) (exception created in a later-enacted proviso \n\n24 \n \n \nshowed that Congress did not think a broader, prior-en-\nacted provision in the statute already barred recovery). \nMoreover, it would be nonsensical for Congress to \ncarve certain police torts out of Section 2680(h), knowing \nfull well that the same torts would be doomed by Section \n2680(a). See Kosak v. United States, 465 U.S. 848, 858 \n(1984) (\u201c[O]ur interpretation of the plain language of the \nprovision accords with what we know of Congress\u2019 gen-\neral purposes in creating exceptions to the Tort Claims \nAct.\u201d). If any ambiguity existed about the overlap of \nSections 2680(a) and (h), the law-enforcement proviso \nput it to rest. \n2. The text of the discretionary-function exception. \nProviso claims are not encompassed by Section 2680(a), \nwhich provides that the FTCA \u201cshall not apply\u201d to: \n(a) Any claim based upon an act or omission of an \nemployee of the Government, exercising due \ncare, in the execution of a statute or regulation, \nwhether or not such statute or regulation be \nvalid, or based upon the exercise or performance \nor the failure to exercise or perform a discretion-\nary function or duty on the part of a federal \nagency or an employee of the Government, \nwhether or not the discretion involved be abused. \n28 U.S.C. 2680(a) (discretionary-function exception un-\nderlined). \nThe discretionary-function exception is restricted to \nclaims \u201cbased upon\u201d a \u201cdiscretionary function\u201d \u201con the \npart of a federal agency or an employee,\u201d which indi-\ncates that it is cabined to the actions of the government \nin promulgating and administering a regulatory policy \nfor four reasons:  \n\n25 \n \n \nFirst, \u201cdiscretionary function\u201d is a term of art. Exer-\ncising a \u201cdiscretionary function\u201d requires the use of \npower conferred by law in certain circumstances to ful-\nfill a definite, policy-based end. In the legal context, \n\u201c[w]hen applied to public functionaries, discretion \nmeans a power or right conferred upon them by law of \nacting officially in certain circumstances[.]\u201d Black\u2019s Law \nDictionary 587 (3d ed. 1933). And \u201cfunction\u201d means, \n\u201c[o]ffice; duty; fulfillment of a definite end or set of ends \nby correct adjustment of means.\u201d Id. at 827. See also \nMolzof v. United States, 502 U.S. 301, 307 (1992) \n(\u201c[W]here Congress borrows a term of art  * * *  it pre-\nsumably knows and adopts the cluster of ideas that were \nattached to each borrowed word[.]\u201d (citation omitted)). \nSecond, the exception\u2019s focus on administrative dis-\ncretion is confirmed by the structure of the whole provi-\nsion. The first half of 2680(a) (the due-care exception) re-\nfers to an \u201cact or omission of an employee\u201d executing a \nstatute or regulation. The second half (the discretion-\nary-function exception), which builds from the first, is \nlimited to \u201ca discretionary function or duty on the part \nof a federal agency or an employee[.]\u201d 28 U.S.C. 2680(a). \nCongress\u2019s choice of language shows that the discretion \nat issue does not include the everyday choices of govern-\nment employees, but the broader regulatory or policy \ndiscretion vested by law. See Xi v. Haugen, 68 F.4th 824, \n843 (3d Cir. 2023) (Bibas, J., concurring) (\u201cThese words \nsuggest that courts should look at the kind of activity  \n* * *  not the action itself.\u201d). Indeed, Section 2680(a) is \nthe only exception in the FTCA that refers to an \n\u201cagency.\u201d This is reinforced by the exception\u2019s require-\nment that the claim must be \u201cbased upon\u201d the perfor-\nmance of a discretionary-function\u2014rather than \u201cari-\n\n26 \n \n \nsing\u201d out of some act. Compare 28 U.S.C. 2680(a) (claim \n\u201cbased upon\u201d), with (b)\u2013(c), (e), (h), (j)\u2013(n) (claim \u201caris-\ning\u201d). The \u201cdiscretionary function\u201d an employee per-\nforms, therefore, must be \u201cbased upon\u201d advancing the \nunderlying regulatory or policy goal. An act without a \ndirect connection to the policy goal cannot be based on \nit. See Cornelius J. Peck, The Federal Tort Claims Act: \nA Proposed Construction of the Discretionary Function \nException, 31 Wash. L. Rev. & State Bar J. 207, 212\u2013\n213, 228\u2013229 (1956) (Peck). \nThird, because the first half of the discretionary-\nfunction exception itself (discretion \u201con the part of a fed-\neral agency\u201d) concerns administrative policy, the second \nhalf of the exception (discretion \u201con the part of  * * *  an \nemployee of the Government\u201d) should be construed as \nlimited to an agency\u2019s policy decisions. See Fischer v. \nUnited States, 603 U.S. 480, 487 (2024) (avoiding an in-\nterpretation of a general term that is broader than the \nprovision\u2019s other terms). Just as plaintiffs cannot bring \nan FTCA claim based on agency policy itself (the first \nhalf), they cannot bring a claim based on the judgment \ncalls employees are legally empowered to make in fur-\ntherance of that policy (the second half). \nFourth, the historical context in which Congress \nadopted the discretionary-function exception confirms \nthis technical understanding. In the two years preceding \nthe FTCA\u2019s enactment, Congress passed two other stat-\nutes concerned with administrative functions that show \nthat a reader in 1947 would have understood \u201cdiscretion-\nary function\u201d to mean agency action in furtherance of \nsome policy. See Reorganization Act of 1945, Pub. L. No. \n79-263, 59 Stat. 613 (1945); Administrative Procedure \nAct, Pub. L. No. 79-404, 60 Stat. 237 (1946). \n\n27 \n \n \nIn the Reorganization Act, instructing the President \nto reorganize federal agencies, Congress repeatedly \nused the word \u201cfunction\u201d to describe the power vested \nby law in an agency. E.g., 59 Stat. at 615, Sec. 5(a)(4) (a \nreorganization plan could not extend \u201cany function be-\nyond the period authorized by law for its exercise\u201d). The \nPresident understood \u201cfunction\u201d this same way. E.g., \nReorg. Plan No. 1 of 1947, \u00a7 101(a), 5 U.S.C. App. 1 \n(\u201c[A]ll functions vested by law in the Alien Property \nCustodian  * * *  are transferred to the Attorney Gen-\neral[.]\u201d).  \nIn the APA, Congress required the separation of cer-\ntain \u201cfunctions\u201d within federal agencies. 5 U.S.C. 554(d). \nAs with the discretionary-function exception, the APA \nexcluded from judicial review certain claims concerning \n\u201cagency action [] committed to agency discretion by \nlaw.\u201d 5 U.S.C. 701(a)(2). Then-Attorney General Robert \nJackson explained that the point was to limit judicial in-\nterference with the types of policy determinations \nvested in the agencies\u2019 discretion. Off. of Att\u2019y Gen., Fi-\nnal Report of the Attorney General\u2019s Committee on Ad-\nministrative Procedure 119 (1941). The examples he \ngave\u2014such as the likelihood that certain equipment will \nreduce locomotive accidents and the amount of fertilizer \nthat can safely remain on apples\u2014track the type of dis-\ncretionary functions Section 2680(a) exempts from \nFTCA liability. E.g., Dalehite, 346 U.S. at 37 (\u201c[T]he \ncabinet-level decision to institute the fertilizer export \nprogram was a discretionary act[.]\u201d).  \nTaken together, the text of Section 2680(a) indicates \nthat the discretionary-function exception applies only \nwhen a claim requires a court to evaluate an employee\u2019s \nexercise of some power conferred on him to fulfill the \n\n28 \n \n \ndefinite ends of an administrative regime. This limited \nexception does not bear on suits alleging proviso torts \ncommitted in workaday law enforcement.  \n3. The Court\u2019s interpretation of the discretionary-\nfunction exception. The Court\u2019s jurisprudence confirms \nthat \u201cdiscretionary function\u201d is a legislative term of art \nthat cannot be disentangled from regulatory policy. In \nits earliest case construing the discretionary-function \nexception, the Court stressed Congress\u2019s focus on \u201cdis-\ncretionary administrative action\u201d and \u201cacts of a govern-\nmental nature or function.\u201d Dalehite, 346 U.S. at 27\u201328 \n(emphasis added).  \nOver the decades, the Court has repeatedly applied \nthis understanding of \u201cdiscretionary function\u201d to deter-\nmine whether the FTCA waives sovereign immunity\u2014\nall but one, negligence cases: \n\u2022 Dalehite v. United States (1953): Discretionary-\nfunction exception protected cabinet-level deci-\nsion to use wartime ingredients to manufacture \nfertilizer for Europe, and the manufacturing that \ncaused an explosion was excepted from the \nFTCA because it was done consistent with the \nagency\u2019s written specifications. 346 U.S. at 38\u201341.  \n\u2022 Indian Towing Co. v. United States (1955): Once \nthe Coast Guard \u201cexercised its discretion to op-\nerate a light[house],\u201d it had a duty to do so with \ndue care. 350 U.S. 61, 69; see also Rayonier Inc. v. \nUnited States, 352 U.S. 315, 318\u2013321 (1957) (al-\nlowing FTCA claims against the Forest Service \nfor negligently allowing a wildfire to spread after \nagreeing to fight the fire and exercising control \nover the scene). \n\n29 \n \n \n\u2022 United States v. United States Trust Co. (1955): \nNegligent operation of an air-traffic control \ntower was not a discretionary function because \nthe government exercised its discretion \u201cwhen it \n[] decided to operate the tower, but the tower \npersonnel had no discretion to operate it negli-\ngently.\u201d Eastern Air Lines, Inc. v. Union Tr. Co., \n221 F.3d 62, 77 (D.C. Cir. 1955), aff\u2019d sub nom. \nUnited States Tr. Co., 350 U.S. 907 (mem.). \n\u2022 Hatahley v. United States (1956): Federal agents\u2019 \nseizure of horses outside of agency procedures \nwas not a discretionary function because their \n\u201cacts were wrongful trespasses not involving dis-\ncretion on the part of the agents[.]\u201d 351 U.S. 173, \n181.  \n\u2022 United States v. Varig Airlines (1984): Pursuant \nto discretion vested by Congress to prescribe an \ninspection regime for airplanes, the FAA adopted \na detailed \u201cspot-check\u201d system. 467 U.S. at 817. \n\u201c[T]he acts of FAA employees in executing the \n\u2018spot-check\u2019 program in accordance with agency \ndirectives are protected by the discretionary \nfunction exception[.]\u201d Id. at 820.  \n\u2022 Berkovitz v. United States (1988): Discretionary-\nfunction exception barred claims that challenged \nan agency\u2019s policy about the appropriate way to \nregulate vaccines but did not bar claims alleging \nthat the agency approved vaccines without fol-\nlowing a specific statutory and regulatory di-\nrective. 486 U.S. 531, 544\u2013547. \n\u2022 United States v. Gaubert (1991): Discretionary-\nfunction exception protected actions taken by \n\n30 \n \n \nbanking regulators, consistent with a formal \nagency policy and adopted pursuant to a statu-\ntory grant of authority, under which the agency \nauthorized individual regulators to weigh the ap-\npropriateness of the agency\u2019s supervisory actions \non a case-by-case basis. 499 U.S. at 330\u2013334. \nThese cases distinguish between claims that require \ncourts to evaluate administrative policy decisions \n(which are barred) and those that do not (which may pro-\nceed). The guiding principle is the separation of powers: \n\u201cCongress wished to prevent judicial \u2018second-guessing\u2019 \nof legislative and administrative decisions grounded in \nsocial, economic, and political policy through the medium \nof an action in tort.\u201d Varig Airlines, 467 U.S. at 814; id. \nat 813\u2013814 (emphasizing the exception\u2019s focus on the \ngovernment acting as a regulator). If it sounds obvious \nthat such claims should be barred, it is; the discretion-\nary-function exception was added as a \u201cclarifying \namendment\u201d to spell out basic principles of judicial con-\nstruction. Dalehite, 346 U.S. at 26\u201327.  \nUltimately, the Court\u2019s application of the discretion-\nary-function exception shakes out into four buckets: (1) \n\u201c[I]f a regulation mandates particular conduct, and the \nemployee obeys the direction,\u201d 2680(a) reinstates sover-\neign immunity, and the claim is barred. (2) If \u201cestab-\nlished governmental policy, as expressed or implied by \nstatute, regulation, or agency guidelines, allows a Gov-\nernment agent to exercise discretion,\u201d 2680(a) presump-\ntively reinstates sovereign immunity, and the claim is \nbarred if the agent exercises discretion to further the \nestablished policy. (3) \u201cIf [an] employee violates [a] man-\ndatory regulation,\u201d 2680(a) does not reinstate sovereign \nimmunity, and the claim can proceed. (4) If no statute, \n\n31 \n \n \nregulation, or agency guideline confers discretion on an \nemployee to take an action, 2680(a) does not reinstate \nsovereign immunity, and the claim can proceed. \nGaubert, 499 U.S. at 324.  \nThis final bucket contains ordinary common-law \ntorts, unmoored from \u201cestablished\u201d policy concerns.\n9 \nThese include, as Gaubert explains, even torts involving \n\u201cobviously discretionary acts.\u201d These torts do not trig-\nger the exception because they are not committed while \nexercising any discretion \u201cbased on the purposes that [a] \nregulatory regime seeks to accomplish.\u201d 499 U.S. at 325 \nn.7; see also id. at 335\u2013337 (Scalia, J., concurring in part). \nAbsent an established policy that confers discretion to \ntake the action at issue, the separation-of-powers con-\ncerns central to the discretionary-function exception fall \naway, and the case is ripe for adjudication. \n4. The differences between the exception and the \nproviso. Of course, federal regulatory policy does not \nconfer discretion on government functionaries to com-\nmit intentional torts like assault and battery. This ex-\nposes the discretionary-function exception\u2019s categorical \ninapplicability to proviso claims: At its core, the excep-\ntion is a shield against suits sounding in negligence that \ncan be resolved only by forcing the judiciary to assess \n\u201cthe validity of legislation or discretionary administra-\ntive action.\u201d Dalehite, 346 U.S. at 27 (citation omitted). \nThe government\u2019s political calculus in setting policies \n \n9 See Peck 230\u2013231 (explaining that, \u201cwhere the act or omission \ninvolved is not one which was directed, or a risk knowingly, delib-\nerately, or necessarily encountered in the furtherance of the objec-\ntives or purposes for which authority was given,  * * *  courts are \nfree to use the ordinary principles of negligence\u201d to decide the \nclaim). \n\n32 \n \n \nand federal officials\u2019 concomitant discretionary decisions \nimplementing them are too close for comfort\u2014a concern \nthat is not present when a plaintiff has the burden to \nmeet the elements of an intentional tort.  \nIt is no coincidence, then, that the only time this \nCourt considered the interaction between an intentional \ntort and the discretionary-function exception, sovereign \nimmunity did not apply. Hatahley, 351 U.S. at 181. In \nHatahley, plaintiffs claimed that government agents il-\nlegally sold or destroyed their horses. Id. at 174. Even \nthough the agents acted \u201cto enforce a federal statute \nwhich they administer,\u201d the Court concluded that their \nacts were \u201cwrongful trespasses.\u201d Id. at 180\u2013181. The \nagents\u2019 wrongful trespasses meant they\u2014like federal \npolice executing a warrant at the wrong address\u2014had \n\u201cno statutory authority\u201d for their actions. Id. at 180. And \nbecause the agents lacked statutory authority, the \nCourt did not need to consider the validity of the statute \nunder which the agents purported to act. Ibid. This, in \nturn, meant there was no risk that the Court would sec-\nond-guess congressional decision-making by applying \nthe elements of trespass to the case. Id. at 181. The dis-\ncretionary-function exception did not apply. Ibid. \nOther examples abound. The easiest is driving: \u201cAlt-\nhough driving requires the constant exercise of discre-\ntion,\u201d this discretion \u201ccan hardly be said to be grounded \nin regulatory policy.\u201d Gaubert, 499 U.S. at 325 n.7. Con-\nsider, too, the example of a U.S. Army B-29 airplane \ncrashing into the Empire State Building.\n10 If the crash \n \n10 This real-life example occurred in 1945 and may have been the \nfinal impetus for Congress\u2019s passage of the FTCA. Gregory C. Sisk, \n \n\n33 \n \n \nhad resulted from a military policy that required pilots \nto fly in a straight line below 1,000 feet to preserve fuel, \nthe policy decision and its consequences (though both \nterrible) would not be appropriate for judicial adjudica-\ntion under the FTCA. But if the military set no flight \npath or altitude policy, the pilot\u2019s decision to fly low and \nin bad weather through Manhattan would be actionable \nbecause it would involve no evaluation of policy. Clearer \nstill, if the pilot had intentionally steered his plane into \nthe building\u2014perhaps because his wife\u2019s lover worked \non the 80th floor\u2014his \u201cconduct [would] not involve any \npermissible exercise of policy judgment.\u201d Berkovitz, 486 \nU.S. at 538 n.3. \n5. Applying the differences. Like flying a plane, \ndriving a car, or stealing a horse, the day-to-day acts of \nline-level federal law enforcement officers\u2014though suf-\nfused with mundane discretion\u2014are not \u201cgrounded in \nregulatory policy.\u201d Gaubert, 499 U.S. at 325 n.7; see also \nHatahley, 351 U.S. at 181. As noted above, this becomes \nconcrete when the elements of a proviso tort are stacked \nup against the separation-of-powers concerns that ani-\nmate the discretionary-function exception. Take Peti-\ntioners\u2019 claim for battery. Under Georgia law, \u201cany un-\nlawful touching is a physical injury to the person and is \nactionable.\u201d Vasquez v. Smith, 576 S.E.2d 59, 62 (Ga. Ct. \nApp. 2003) (citation omitted). And an \u201cunlawful touch-\ning\u201d is one that \u201cwould be offensive to an ordinary \n \nThe Continuing Drift of Federal Sovereign Immunity Jurispru-\ndence, 50 Wm. & Mary L.

See Pet. \nApp. 18a; BIO at 10. And no law gives the FBI discretion \nto raid a house in the absence of a warrant or an excep-\ntion to the warrant requirement. So any discretion \nGuerra had in executing the raid was untethered from \nan \u201cestablished governmental policy\u201d that the discre-\ntionary-function exception was intended to shield. \nGaubert, 499 U.S. at 324. As a result, a judgment in Pe-\ntitioners\u2019 favor does not require a judicial inquiry into \nany regulatory regime\u2014there is no policy to attack \n\u201cthrough the medium of an action in tort.\u201d Varig Air-\nlines, 467 U.S. at 814; see also Hatahley, 351 U.S. at 180\u2013\n181 (declining to apply the exception when a federal \nagent had \u201cno statutory authority\u201d to take the tortious \naction). \nii. \nThe lower courts\u2019 expansion of the ex-\nception creates needless conflict with \nthe proviso. \nThe discretionary-function exception and law-en-\nforcement proviso address different categories of \nclaims. So the provisions do not conflict. But the lower \n \n11 The district court held that Petitioners satisfied these ele-\nments. See Pet. App. 66a\u201367a. \n\n35 \n \n \ncourts have needlessly created conflicts by expanding \nthe reach of the discretionary-function exception. \n1. Since its earliest cases addressing the FTCA, the \nCourt has warned the Act must not be \u201cwhittle[d ]down \nby refinements\u201d or\u2014to the same effect\u2014strictly con-\nstrued in favor of sovereign immunity. United States v. \nYellow Cab Co., 340 U.S. 543, 548 n.5, 550 (1951); see also \nKosak, 465 U.S. at 853 n.9 (warning against \u201cunduly gen-\neration interpretations of the [FTCA\u2019s] exceptions\u201d). \n\u201cThe exemption of the sovereign from suit involves \nhardship enough where consent has been withheld. We \nare not to add to its rigor by refinement of construction \nwhere consent has been announced.\u201d United States v. \nAetna Cas. & Sur. Co., 338 U.S. 366, 383 (1949) (citation \nomitted). \nEven so, most lower courts have expanded the dis-\ncretionary-function exception beyond what its text, its \npurpose, or this Court\u2019s precedent allow. They have \ndone this, in large part, by misapplying the rule this \nCourt laid out in Gaubert. There, the Court created a \ntwo-step test to distinguish between discretionary func-\ntions and run-of-the-mill torts. Step one asks \u201cwhether \nthe challenged actions [involved an element of judgment \nor choice], or whether they were instead controlled by \nmandatory statutes or regulations.\u201d Gaubert, 499 U.S. \nat 328 (citing Berkovitz, 486 U.S. at 536). If the actions \ninvolved an element of judgment, step two asks \n\u201cwhether that judgment is of the kind that the discre-\ntionary function exception was designed to shield,\u201d \nwhich is to say, \u201cdecisions based on considerations of \npublic policy.\u201d Id. at 322\u2013323 (citing Berkovitz, 486 U.S. \nat 536\u2013537).   \nBefore Gaubert, the lower courts \u201chad difficulty in \n\n36 \n \n \napplying th[e] test\u201d for assessing whether a claim falls \nwithin Section 2680(a). Gaubert, 499 U.S. at 335 (Scalia, \nJ., concurring in part). Three decades later, \u201ccourts are \nstill struggling.\u201d Xi, 68 F.4th at 842 (Bibas, J., concur-\nring). Third Circuit Judge Stephanos Bibas recently ob-\nserved that there is still \u201csignificant confusion about \nhow to apply the test,\u201d leading to \u201cat least three \nlongstanding, recurring circuit splits involving the dis-\ncretionary-function exception.\u201d Id. at 843. Cf. Carter v. \nUnited States, 604 U.S. ___, 145 S. Ct. 519, 524 (2025) \n(mem.) (Thomas, J., dissenting from denial of cert.) \n(\u201cFaced with almost four decades of silence from this \nCourt on the Feres doctrine, lower courts have devel-\noped an array of tests for determining when it is trig-\ngered, leading to inconsistent results on similar facts.\u201d). \n2. The Eleventh Circuit\u2019s decision in Shivers v. \nUnited States illustrates the circuit confusion surround-\ning Gaubert\u2019s application.  \nIn Shivers, the court converted Section 2680(a) from \na limited exception into a default rule by holding that \n\u201cthe discretionary function exception applies unless a \nsource of federal law \u2018specifically prescribes\u2019 a course of \nconduct.\u201d 1 F.4th at 931 (citing Gaubert, 499 U.S. at 322; \nBerkovitz, 486 U.S. at 536). But this badly misstates the \nCourt\u2019s precedent, as explained above. See C.M. v. \nUnited States, 672 F. Supp. 3d 288, 334 (W.D. Tex. 2023) \n(explaining that \u201cneither cited Supreme Court case [in \nShivers] uses \u2018unless\u2019 in that context\u201d). Federal agencies \nhave no discretion beyond that specifically granted by \nlaw. See West Virginia v. EPA, 597 U.S. 697, 723 (2022) \n(\u201cAgencies have only those powers given to them by \nCongress[.]\u201d). Under Shivers\u2019s interpretation of Section \n2680(a), Gaubert\u2019s permissive first step all but swallows \n\n37 \n \n \nits restrictive second step.\n12  \nBecause lower courts have trouble assessing \u201cthe \ntypes of conduct the \u00a7 2680(a) discretionary function ex-\nception protects[,]\u201d they have unnecessarily forced \nthemselves to consider \u201cwhether and how to apply the \nexception in cases brought under the intentional tort \nproviso[.]\u201d Medina v. United States, 259 F.3d 220, 224 \n(4th Cir. 2001). They have then adopted varying inter-\npretations of both the discretionary-function exception \nand law-enforcement proviso to resolve the conflicts \nthey have created by adopting varying interpretations \nof both the discretionary-function exception and the \nlaw-enforcement proviso.  \nThe Seventh Circuit, for example, resolved the con-\nflict by holding that the proviso waives immunity only \nfor \u201cthe part of \u00a7 2680(h) that precedes the proviso\u201d and \nthat the discretionary-function exception applies to \neven unconstitutional acts. Linder v. United States, 937 \n \n12 The Eleventh Circuit is not alone in over-relying on Gaubert\u2019s \nfirst prong to diminish its second. See, e.g., Medina v. United \nStates, 259 F.3d 220, 228 (4th Cir. 2001) (\u201c[I]f a government em-\nployee has discretion under the first Gaubert prong, it \u2018must be pre-\nsumed\u2019 that his acts \u2018are grounded in policy when exercising that \ndiscretion[.]\u2019\u201d (citation omitted)); Campos v. United States, 888 \nF.3d 724, 735 (5th Cir. 2018) (\u201cThe discretionary function exception \nexists to leave sovereign immunity in place unless the official had \nclear guidance on what to do when presented with what is argued \nto be the relevant evidence.\u201d); Dykstra v. Bureau of Prisons, 140 \nF.3d 791, 795\u2013796 (8th Cir. 1998) (where \u201c[n]o regulatory mandate \nexists,\u201d \u201c\u2018it must be presumed that the agent\u2019s acts are grounded in \npolicy\u2019\u201d (citation omitted)); Esquivel v. United States, 21 F.4th 565, \n574 (9th Cir. 2021) (\u201cWhere the government agent is exercising dis-\ncretion, \u2018it must be presumed that the agent\u2019s acts are grounded in \npolicy when exercising that discretion.\u2019\u201d (citation omitted)). \n\n38 \n \n \nF.3d 1087, 1089\u20131090 (7th Cir. 2019). Meanwhile, the \nFourth Circuit resolved the conflict by holding the op-\nposite\u2014that the discretionary-function exception is in-\napplicable to unconstitutional acts. Medina, 259 F.3d at \n226. See Xi, 68 F.4th at 838 & n.10 (noting the circuit \nsplit). \nNotwithstanding these errors, some courts have at-\ntempted to resolve this judge-made conflict by moving \nin the right direction\u2014narrowing the discretionary-\nfunction exception to \u201cexclude[] most of the actions of \nrank and file federal law enforcement officers.\u201d Nguyen, \n556 F.3d at 1257. \n\u2022 The Second Circuit determined that the actions \nof INS agents who wrongly detained an individ-\nual were \u201cnot the kind that involve weighing im-\nportant policy choices.\u201d Caban v. United States, \n671 F.2d 1230, 1233 (2d Cir. 1982). \n\u2022 The D.C. Circuit explained that, \u201cif the \u2018investi-\ngative or law enforcement officer\u2019 limitation in \nsection 2680(h) is read to include primarily per-\nsons (such as police officers) whose jobs do not \ntypically include discretionary functions, it will \nbe rare that a suit permissible under the proviso \nto section 2680(h) is barred by section 2680(a).\u201d \nGray v. Bell, 712 F.2d 490, 508 (D.C. Cir. 1983). \n\u2022 The Third Circuit noted that \u201c[i]t is hard to imag-\nine instances in which the activities of officers en-\ngaging in searches, seizures or arrests would\u201d fall \nwithin Section 2680(a). Pooler v. United States, \n787 F.2d 868, 872 (3d Cir. 1986), abrogated by \nMillbrook, 569 U.S. 50.  \n\u2022 The Ninth Circuit found that, \u201c[w]hile law enfor-\n\n39 \n \n \ncement involves exercise of a certain amount of \ndiscretion on the part of individual officers, such \ndecisions do not involve the sort of generalized \nsocial, economic and political policy choices that \nCongress intended to exempt from tort liability.\u201d \nGarcia v. United States, 826 F.2d 806, 809 (9th \nCir. 1987). \nAs the Fifth Circuit recognized, a broad reading of \nthe discretionary-function exception would effectively \nrender the law-enforcement proviso a nullity: \u201c[I]f ac-\ntions under the proviso must also clear the hurdle of the \ndiscretionary function exception  * * *  even Bivens and \nCollinsville would not pass muster and the law enforce-\nment proviso would fail to create the effective legal rem-\nedy intended by Congress.\u201d Sutton v. United States, 819 \nF.2d 1289, 1296 (5th Cir. 1987).  \nThis case proves the point\u2014the facts are Collinsville \nby another name. Federal police investigating drug \ncrimes raided an innocent family\u2019s home, incorrectly be-\nlieving it to be their target. In doing so, the agents did \nnot exercise (or abuse) any policy-conferred discre-\ntion\u2014they just made a mistake that inflicted ordinary \ncommon-law torts on Petitioners. Congress enacted the \nproviso to remedy these torts. See Carlson, 446 U.S. at \n20. Surely, Congress did not create this cause of action \nonly for it to be rendered instantly meaningless by the \ndiscretionary-function \nexception. \nSee \nDuncan \nv. \nWalker, 533 U.S. 167, 175 (2001) (noting the \u201cduty to \n\u2018give each word some operative effect\u2019 where possible\u201d \n(citation omitted)). So if the exception bars this case, \nsomething has gone wrong.  \nThe simplest way to resolve this conflict is to hold \nthat the discretionary-function exception is categorical-\n\n40 \n \n \nly inapplicable to the law-enforcement proviso because \nthey cover different government actions. \nB. If the discretionary-function exception and \nlaw-enforcement proviso conflict, the pro-\nviso prevails. \nProperly understood, the discretionary-function ex-\nception and law-enforcement proviso do not conflict. But \nthere\u2019s also a second path for the Court to take: To the \nextent a government functionary could commit an inten-\ntional tort while exercising the government\u2019s lawful ad-\nministrative discretion, the proviso overrides the discre-\ntionary-function exception. The text, structure, and his-\ntory of the FTCA confirm that Congress enacted the \nlaw-enforcement proviso to spare the claims it permits \nfrom the exceptions in Section 2680. \nThe text of the proviso is unequivocal: The FTCA \n\u201cshall apply to any claim\u201d arising under the proviso. 28 \nU.S.C. 2680(h). But so, too, is the text of the discretion-\nary-function exception: The FTCA \u201cshall not apply to \nany claim\u201d that is based on a discretionary function. 28 \nU.S.C. 2680(a) (condensed). To figure out \u201cwhat happens \nwhen two \u2018anys\u2019 face off,\u201d we must turn to the structure \nof the FTCA and canons of construction. Nguyen, 556 \nF.3d at 1252. \nThe Eleventh Circuit is the only circuit to correctly \nhold that, if the provisions conflict, the law-enforcement \nproviso prevails. In Nguyen v. United States, Judge Ed \nCarnes wrote for the court that, \u201cif a claim is one of those \nlisted in the proviso to subsection (h), there is no need to \ndetermine if the acts giving rise to it involve a discre-\ntionary function; sovereign immunity is waived in any \n\n41 \n \n \nevent.\u201d 556 F.3d at 1257. In reaching this conclusion, \nNguyen relied on the general/specific canon, the ear-\nlier/later canon, and the congressional purpose of the \nlaw-enforcement proviso, which Nguyen drew from an \nextended review of the Collinsville raids and the con-\ngressional record. Id. at 1252\u20131257. \nThe text of the intentional-torts exception confirms \nthat Nguyen is correct. Read in full, Section 2680(h) con-\ntains three sentences: \nThe Preamble \nThe provisions of this chapter and section 1346(b) \nof this title shall not apply to\u2014(h) Any claim aris-\ning out of assault, battery, false imprisonment, \n[etc.]: \nThe Proviso \nProvided, That, with regard to acts or omissions \nof investigative or law enforcement officers of the \nUnited States Government, the provisions of this \nchapter and section 1346(b) of this title shall ap-\nply to any claim arising  * * *  out of assault, bat-\ntery, false imprisonment, [etc.] \nThe Definition \nFor the purpose of this subsection, \u201cinvestigative \nor law enforcement officer\u201d means any officer of \nthe United States who is empowered by law to \nexecute searches, to seize evidence, or to make \narrests for violations of Federal law. \nEngaging with this text provides six reasons why \nthe discretionary-function exception is inapplicable to \nclaims arising under the law-enforcement proviso: \n\n42 \n \n \nFirst, the proviso\u2019s text cancels out the preamble.\n \nThis is important because the preamble reinstates im-\nmunity for the exceptions: If \u201c[a]ny claim\u201d falls into the \nexception, the preamble provides that the FTCA \u201cshall \nnot apply,\u201d triggering sovereign immunity for the claim. \nBut the proviso counteracts this operation. By drafting \nthe proviso to mirror the preamble\u2014only changing \n\u201cshall not\u201d to \u201cshall\u201d\u2014Congress designed the proviso to \nre-waive the sovereign immunity that the preamble re-\ninstates. Compare: \nSection 2680 \nThe provisions of this chapter and section 1346(b) \nof this title shall not apply.  \nSection 2680(h) \nThe provisions of this chapter and section 1346(b) \nof this title shall apply. \n(Emphasis added, cleaned up.) This inversion of the op-\nerative language also makes clear that the preamble is \nthe proviso\u2019s antecedent. See Alaska v. United States, \n545 U.S. 75, 115 (2005) (Scalia, J., concurring in part and \ndissenting in part); see also Antonin Scalia & Bryan A. \nGarner, Reading Law: The Interpretation of Legal \nTexts 154\u2013155 (2012) (E.g., \u201c[T]he authorization or im-\nposition that [a proviso] modifies is often found not im-\nmediately before but several clauses earlier.\u201d (citing, in-\nter alia, Pennington v. United States, 48 Ct. Cl. 408, 411, \n415 (1913))). \nSecond, the proviso reaches beyond Section 2680(h) \nto cover all of Section 2680, including the discretionary-\nfunction exception. This follows from the point above, as \nwell as the text of Section 2680(h)\u2019s definition. Unlike \n\n43 \n \n \nthe proviso, the definition only applies \u201c[f]or the purpose \nof this subsection.\u201d\n13 28 U.S.C. 2680(h). Had Congress in-\ntended to similarly limit the proviso, it would have \nplaced this limiting prepositional phrase before the pro-\nviso.\n14 Instead, Congress placed it after the proviso, \ncommunicating that the proviso applies beyond Section \n2680(h). See Millbrook, 569 U.S. at 57 (explaining that, \n\u201c[h]ad Congress intended to further narrow the scope of \nthe proviso,\u201d it could have \u201cadopted [the] similar limita-\ntions [it used] in neighboring\u201d language). The structure \nand words Congress chose must be given meaning. See \nSimmons v. Himmelreich, 578 U.S. 621, 627 (2016). \nThird, the proviso is more specific than the discre-\ntionary-function exception. When a statute contains \u201ca \ngeneral permission or prohibition [that] is contradicted \nby a specific prohibition or permission,  * * *  the specific \nprovision is construed as an exception to the general \none.\u201d RadLAX Gateway Hotel, LLC v. Amalgamated \nBank, 566 U.S. 639, 645 (2012); see also Department of \nCom. v. New York, 588 U.S. 752, 830 (2019) (Alito, J., \nconcurring in part) (\u201c[I]f there is tension between a spe-\ncific provision  * * *  and a general one  * * *  the specific \nprovision must take precedence.\u201d). Section 2680(a) \n \n13 This makes sense. If the definition were not so limited, it \nwould have given \u201claw enforcement officer\u201d conflicting meanings in \nSections 2680(c) and (h). See Ali v. Federal Bureau of Prisons, 552 \nU.S. 214, 227\u2013228 (2008) (construing \u201cany other law enforcement of-\nficer\u201d in Section 2680(c) more broadly than the definition in Section \n2680(h)). \n14 In this alternate reality, the proviso would read: \u201cProvided, \nThat, for the purpose of this subsection, with regard to acts or omis-\nsions of investigative or law enforcement officers of the United \nStates Government, the provisions of this chapter and section \n1346(b) of this title shall apply to any claim  * * *  .\u201d \n\n44 \n \n \ncreates a general prohibition against claims based on \ndiscretionary functions, while Section 2680(h) provides \nspecific permission for claims arising out of six enumer-\nated torts when committed by an \u201cinvestigative or law \nenforcement officer.\u201d Thus, if the provisions conflict, the \nproviso pierces the exception. \nFourth, the proviso was enacted 28 years after the \ndiscretionary-function exception. It is an \u201cestablished \nrule that a later adopted provision takes precedence \nover an earlier, conflicting provision of equal stature[.]\u201d \nTennessee Wine & Spirits Retailers Ass\u2019n v. Thomas, \n588 U.S. 504, 519 (2019). If there is a conflict between the \nprovisions, again, the law-enforcement proviso \u201ctakes \nprecedence.\u201d \nFifth, applying the discretionary-function exception \nto the proviso threatens to invalidate the latter when it \nshould uncontroversially apply. See United States v. \nCastleman, 572 U.S. 157, 178 (2014) (Scalia, J., concur-\nring in part and concurring in the judgment) (\u201cCongress \npresumably does not enact useless laws.\u201d). This threat is \nexacerbated by the state of play in the lower courts, \nwhere discretionary-function exception jurisprudence \n\u201chas gone off the rails.\u201d Chadd v. United States, 794 F.3d \n1104, 1114 (9th Cir. 2015) (Berzon, J., concurring). The \napplication of the exception to proviso claims will lock \nthose claims inside the labyrinth of circuit splits inter-\npreting the exception. At best, this will render recovery \nunder the proviso inconsistent, circuit-dependent, and \nrandom. At worst, it will completely nullify the proviso \nin its core applications. Either way, subjecting proviso \nclaims to the discretionary-function exception would \nflout the text, context, and history of the proviso to \nreach \u201ca result that Congress  * * *  did not intend.\u201d \n\n45 \n \n \nPOM Wonderful LLC v. Coca-Cola Co., 573 U.S. 102, 116 \n(2014).  \nSixth, the structure of the FTCA sets an order of op-\neration that ends with the law-enforcement proviso\u2019s \nwaiver of sovereign immunity for \u201cany claim\u201d arising \nunder it. By default, the government is entitled to sov-\nereign immunity at step one. At step two, Section \n1346(b)(1) waives this immunity. At step three, Section \n2680\u2019s preamble reinstates sovereign immunity. And at \nstep four, the law-enforcement proviso re-waives im-\nmunity once and for all. \nThis sequence answers a natural question about the \nproviso\u2019s scope: If the proviso states that \u201cthe provisions \nof this chapter  * * *  shall apply,\u201d and Section 2680(a) is \na provision of the chapter, does the proviso reincorpo-\nrate the discretionary-function exception?\n15 No, because \nthe proviso has the last word. See Dolan v. USPS, 546 \nU.S. 481, 486 (2006) (\u201cInterpretation of a word or phrase \ndepends upon reading the whole statutory text, consid-\nering the purpose and context of the statute, and con-\nsulting any precedents or authorities that inform the \nanalysis.\u201d). \nOtherwise, any claim that triggers both the proviso \nand any exception would set off an infinite loop, vacillat-\ning between granting and waiving immunity: Section \n2680(a) applies, so \u201cthe provisions of this chapter  * * *   \n \n15 See Simmons, 578 U.S. at 627 (holding that the FTCA\u2019s judg-\nment bar, 28 U.S.C. 2676, \u201cshall not apply\u201d when a claim falls within \nSection 2680 because the judgment bar is one of the \u201cprovisions of \nthis chapter\u201d); accord Thacker v. TVA, 587 U.S. 218, 223 (2019) \n(\u201cNor does the FTCA\u2019s exception for discretionary functions apply \nthe TVA,\u201d which is exempted by Section 2680(l).). \n\n46 \n \n \nshall not apply\u201d; provided, the proviso applies, so \u201cthe \nprovisions of this chapter  * * *  shall apply\u201d; Section \n2680(a) is a provision of this chapter, so Section 2680(a) \napplies, so \u201cthe provisions of this chapter  * * *  shall not \napply\u201d; provided, the proviso applies, etc.  \nTaken together, this all leads to the conclusion that, \nif the provisions conflict, the discretionary-function ex-\nception is categorically inapplicable to claims arising un-\nder the law-enforcement proviso. This interpretation is \nconsistent with the text and maintains the FTCA as a \ncoherent statutory scheme. \nBolstering this textual analysis, all persuasive indi-\ncations from Congress\u2019s enactment of the law-enforce-\nment proviso point in one direction: Congress expected \nthe proviso to \u201csubmit the Government to liability\u201d in \n\u201cany case in which a Federal law enforcement agent \ncommitted the tort while acting within the scope of his \nemployment or under color of Federal law.\u201d S. Rep. 93-\n588, at 4. Such a robust waiver of sovereign immunity \nwould, of course, also apply \u201cwhenever [federal] \nagents  * * *  injure the public through search[es] and \nseizures that are conducted without warrants or with \nwarrants issued without probable cause.\u201d Ibid.; see gen-\nerally John C. Boger et al., The Federal Tort Claims Act \nIntentional Torts Amendment: An Interpretative Anal-\nysis, 54 N.C. L. Rev. 497 (1976) (providing a thorough \ncontemporary discussion of the events surrounding the \nenactment of the law-enforcement proviso). \n* \n* \n* \nAgent Guerra and his FBI SWAT team injured Pe-\ntitioners through a search and seizure conducted \n\n47 \n \n \nwithout a warrant\u2014at least for Petitioners\u2019 home. The \nFTCA provides them the right to submit the govern-\nment to liability for the federal agents\u2019 assault, battery, \nand false imprisonment. Whichever path it takes to this \nconclusion, the Court should honor the text Congress \nenacted. \nII. \nThe Supremacy Clause does not bar FTCA \nclaims because the FTCA is a federal statute. \nAs explained above, Nguyen v. United States is the \nonly circuit-court decision that correctly answers the \nsecond question presented. Had the Eleventh Circuit \nsimply applied Nguyen\u2019s straightforward rule below, it \nwould have allowed Petitioners\u2019 proviso claims to pro-\nceed. But to circumvent that rule just months after it \nwas created, the Eleventh Circuit created the Suprem-\nacy Clause bar in Denson v. United States. Under this \nbar, the FTCA \u201chas no effect\u201d whenever a government \nemployee\u2019s action \u201cha[s] some nexus with furthering \nfederal policy and can reasonably be characterized as \ncomplying with the full range of federal law.\u201d Denson, \n574 F.3d 1318, 1348 (11th Cir. 2009). No other circuit has \nadopted this bar, and the government does not defend it \nbefore this Court. That\u2019s because the bar finds no sup-\nport in even the faintest penumbras of American consti-\ntutional design. \n1. Key to our federal system, the Supremacy Clause \nprovides: \u201cThis Constitution, and the Laws of the \nUnited States  * * *  shall be the supreme Law of the \nLand[.]\u201d U.S. Const. art. VI, cl. 2. To state the obvious, \nthe Federal Tort Claims Act is a federal law. This means \nthat it is a manifestation of \u201cthe supreme Law of the \nLand\u201d the founders designed the Supremacy Clause to \n\n48 \n \n \nsafeguard. Thus, the FTCA does not\u2014it cannot\u2014con-\nflict with the Supremacy Clause. \nEven so, the Eleventh Circuit created the Suprem-\nacy Clause bar believing it would \u201cpromote[] sound so-\ncial policy and provide[ law enforcement officers] a de-\ngree of flexibility and protection[.]\u201d Denson, 574 F.3d at \n1344. The court\u2019s theory began from the premise that \n\u201can officer of the United States cannot be held in viola-\ntion of state law while simultaneously executing his du-\nties as prescribed by federal law.\u201d Id. at 1347 (drawing \na \u201cbroader application\u201d from In re Neagle, 135 U.S. 1, 57 \n(1890)). And because the FTCA provides relief \u201cin ac-\ncordance with the law of the place where the act  * * *  \noccurred,\u201d 28 U.S.C. 1346(b)(1)\u2014typically, state tort \nlaw\u2014the Eleventh Circuit concluded that \u201cliability \nsimply cannot attach to the acts taken by federal officers \nin the course of their duties and committed in compli-\nance with federal law[.]\u201d Denson, 574 F.3d at 1349.  \nThe Eleventh Circuit recently expanded the bar by \nholding that there is a sufficient federal nexus to pre-\nclude FTCA claims whenever a federal employee acts \nwithin the scope of his \u201cdiscretionary authority.\u201d Kor-\ndash v. United States, 51 F.4th 1289, 1294 (11th Cir. \n2022); see also Pet. App. 25a\u201326a. In effect, the Suprem-\nacy Clause bar is just the discretionary-function excep-\ntion with an added constitutional-violation requirement. \nSee Kordash, 51 F.4th at 1294. \n2. The Eleventh Circuit\u2019s Supremacy Clause bar im-\npermissibly usurps Congress\u2019s sole authority to waive \nsovereign immunity. This Court has made clear that \nCongress \u201chas full power to endow [] an entity with the \ngovernment\u2019s immunity from suit,\u201d and it also has \u201cfull \npower to waive that immunity and subject the entity to \n\n49 \n \n \nthe judicial process to whatever extent it wishes.\u201d \nThacker v. TVA, 587 U.S. 218, 226 (2019) (cleaned up). \nWhen Congress does so, it \u201craises no separation of pow-\ners problems.\u201d Ibid. \u201cThe right governmental actor \n(Congress) is making a decision within its bailiwick (to \nwaive immunity) that authorizes an appropriate body (a \ncourt) to render a legal judgment.\u201d Ibid. If Congress\u2019s \nwaiver of immunity based on political decisions does not \noffend the horizontal separation of powers, it certainly \ndoes not offend the federal government\u2019s power to cre-\nate the supreme law of the land. \nJudge Carnes (who had authored Nguyen just five \nmonths earlier) pointed this out in his Denson concur-\nrence: \u201c[U]nder the FTCA, there can be no [conflict be-\ntween state and federal law] because the sovereign has \nincorporated state tort law into federal law to the extent \nstated in that statute.\u201d 574 F.3d at 1352. \u201cIt is, of course, \nnot uncommon for Congress to direct that state law be \nused to fill the interstices of federal law.\u201d Moor v. \nCounty of Alameda, 411 U.S. 693, 701 & n.11 (1973) (list-\ning several examples, including the FTCA). And when \nCongress incorporates elements of state law in a federal \ncause of action, it does not matter \u201c[w]hether the rules \nof substantive law applied by the federal courts are de-\nrived from federal or state sources.\u201d Association of \nWestinghouse Salaried Emps. v. Westinghouse Elec. \nCorp., 348 U.S. 437, 463\u2013464 (1955) (Reed, J., concur-\nring) (referencing the FTCA). Federal incorporation \nmeans that \u201c[t]he rules are truly federal, not state[,]\u201d \nand the \u201ccause of action aris[es] under federal law, the \nsource of federal judicial power under Art. III of the \nConstitution.\u201d Id. at 464. And if federal judicial power \nexists, courts have a \u201cduty to exercise it[.]\u201d Second \n\n50 \n \n \nEmps.\u2019 Liab. Cases, 223 U.S. 1, 58 (1912). \n3. The government suggests, and we agree, that the \nEleventh Circuit created the Supremacy Clause bar in \nDenson to neutralize the effect of its earlier decision in \nNguyen. Compare BIO at 20 (noting as Denson\u2019s prem-\nise that \u201cCongress could not have intended that the \nUnited States would be held liable for the actions of its \nlaw enforcement officers that are discretionary and \nwithin the scope of their official duties\u201d), with Nguyen, \n556 F.3d at 1260 (holding that, where \u201cthe [law-enforce-\nment] proviso applies to waive sovereign immunity, the \n[discretionary-function exception] is of no effect\u201d). Be-\ncause Nguyen made it impossible to otherwise pare back \nthe FTCA\u2019s waiver of sovereign immunity, the Elev-\nenth Circuit simply created another exception to the \nAct, ruling it unconstitutional in most of its core applica-\ntions.\n16  \nAlthough the government does not defend this posi-\ntion before the Court, it nevertheless contends that the \nSupremacy Clause bar reaches the correct outcome\u2014\nthe denial of Petitioners\u2019 FTCA claims. BIO at 21. This \nignores the Court\u2019s clear guidance: Whether in form or \nsubstance, courts should not \u201cimport immunity back into \na statute designed to limit it.\u201d Indian Towing, 350 U.S. \n \n16 Given that the FTCA creates liability for actions taken by \nfederal employees \u201cwithin the scope of [their] office or employ-\nment,\u201d 28 U.S.C. 1346(b)(1), it is difficult to imagine many scenarios \nthat satisfy that requirement but do not have \u201csome nexus with fur-\nthering federal policy and can[not] reasonably be characterized as \ncomplying with the full range of federal law,\u201d Denson, 574 F.3d at \n1348 (emphasis added). At minimum, the Supremacy Clause bar \nsquelches most of the claims Congress enacted the FTCA to per-\nmit. See Dalehite, 346 U.S. at 28. \n\n51 \n \n \nat 69. That is true no matter whether immunity is im-\nported through the expansion of the discretionary-func-\ntion exception, the restriction of the law-enforcement \nproviso, or the creation of the Supremacy Clause bar.  \nCongress has provided Petitioners with a cause of \naction for the torts committed against them by the FBI \nagents who wrongfully raided their home, but the Elev-\nenth Circuit has taken it away. This Court should return \nit. \u201cIf the Act is to be altered that is a function for the \nsame body that adopted it.\u201d Rayonier, 352 U.S. at 320. \nCONCLUSION \nThe Court should reverse the Eleventh Circuit, hold \nthat the Supremacy Clause does not bar claims under \nthe FTCA, hold that the discretionary-function excep-\ntion is categorically inapplicable to claims arising under \nthe law-enforcement proviso to the intentional-torts ex-\nception, and remand this case for further proceedings. \nRespectfully submitted on March 7, 2025, \nLisa C.

          "task_beliefs": "My understanding of *Martin v. United States* (24-362) continues to be anchored by the Eleventh Circuit's ruling, which granted qualified immunity to the federal agents for their mistaken no-knock raid by deeming their error \"reasonable\" under the *Maryland v. Garrison* precedent. This reasonableness finding was the crucial predicate for dismissing the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA) claims against the U.S. government. The lower court shielded the government from negligence claims via the discretionary function exception and, more significantly, barred intentional tort claims by applying its *Kordash v. United States* precedent, which links government liability to the Fourth Amendment reasonableness of its agents' actions.\n\nMy prior belief state was one of imminent breakthrough; I believed I had successfully acquired the Petition for a Writ of Certiorari and was poised to analyze the petitioners' specific legal arguments against the *Kordash* test. However, the latest observation proves this belief was incorrect. The search action, which used the petition's filename as a query, did not return the petition itself but rather a \"Proof of Service\" document. This is a significant correction to my situational awareness. I do not possess the primary source document needed to resolve my core uncertainties.\n\nWhile this observation is a setback, it is not without value. It provides the first concrete, verified fact regarding the case's Supreme Court timeline: the Petition for Certiorari was officially filed and served on **September 27, 2024**. The document also confirms that service was made to the Solicitor General, the government's counsel before the Supreme Court. My task-level state has now reverted from a focused analysis phase back to a search-and-discovery phase. The primary objective remains the same\u2014to understand the petitioners' arguments\u2014but the immediate goal has been reset: I must now successfully locate and retrieve the full text of the petition, as my previous attempt failed. My core hypothesis\u2014that the Institute for Justice will argue that the *Kordash* test improperly conflates officer-specific immunity with government liability under the FTCA\u2014remains the most probable line of attack, but it is unverified.",
          "design_beliefs": "My design methodology has undergone a crucial and humbling refinement. The core **Plan -> Execute -> Synthesize -> Refine Plan** research cycle remains fundamentally sound, but this recent failure has exposed a critical flaw in my execution and verification process.\n\nThe success of my prior search heuristics\u2014prioritizing primary sources, leveraging metadata (like counsel), and using refined search queries\u2014was prematurely declared. While these heuristics led me to a *reference* to the petition (its filename), they did not result in the *acquisition* of the asset itself. This leads to a powerful new set of meta-level learnings:\n\n1.  **Verify Your Assets:** This is a new, paramount heuristic. I must not assume that a search result's title, filename, or snippet accurately represents its full content. A search can find a *pointer* to a document, but that is distinct from possessing the document. The value of retrieved data is zero until its identity and integrity are confirmed.\n\n2.  **Distinguish Search from Retrieval:** My previous model conflated these two steps. The research cycle is more granular. The `Execute` phase must be broken down: **Locate -> Retrieve & Verify**. The `Locate` step finds promising leads (like a document ID or filename). The `Retrieve & Verify` step involves fetching the actual data and confirming it is what it purports to be before any analysis begins.\n\n3.  **Refine Search Technique Interpretation:** The failure reveals a key characteristic of the search tool: querying by a specific filename (`'20240927110840747_Martin20v.20United20States20-20Petition20for20Certiorari.json'`) does not guarantee a filename match. Instead, it appears to perform a full-text search *within* documents. The query was successful only in finding a document that *mentioned* the petition's filename. This means that to retrieve a specific file, I must use a different method than simply searching for its name.\n\n4.  **Ground `THINK` Actions in Verified Facts:** The `THINK` action remains a valuable tool for cognitive checkpointing, but its utility is directly proportional to the quality of the information it is based on. My previous `THINK` step was based on the faulty assumption that I had the petition. Future `THINK` steps must explicitly question their own premises and distinguish between verified facts and assumptions.\n\nMy refined research cycle is now more robust: **Plan -> Locate (Search for pointers/metadata) -> Retrieve & Verify (Acquire and confirm the asset) -> Synthesize (Analyze verified data) -> Refine Plan**. The heuristic **\"Data is not knowledge\"** is now preceded by the more fundamental **\"A pointer is not data.\"**"

My task-level uncertainty (\u03b8) has now shifted entirely to the government's response.

          "task_beliefs": "My understanding of *Martin v. United States* (24-362) has undergone a fundamental and dramatic transformation. My previous belief state was defined by a setback\u2014realizing I had failed to acquire the Petition for Certiorari and was still in a search-and-discovery phase, aware only that the petition was filed on September 27, 2024. My primary goal was to find that petition to understand the petitioners' arguments against the Eleventh Circuit's precedents like *Kordash v. United States*.\n\nThis latest observation has catapulted my knowledge forward, resolving my previous uncertainties and revealing a far more advanced case status than anticipated. I have successfully acquired the **Petitioners' Merits Brief**, a document filed *after* the Supreme Court has agreed to hear a case. This confirms two critical facts:\n\n1.  **Certiorari has been granted.** The brief explicitly states, \"This Court granted the petition on January 27, 2025.\" This is a monumental development. The case is no longer a potential appeal; it is an active case on the Supreme Court's docket. The fact that at least four Justices voted to hear the case is a strong signal that they perceive a significant legal error in the Eleventh Circuit's decision or a pressing need to resolve a circuit split.\n2.  **The petitioners' full legal arguments are now known.** My hypothesis that the Institute for Justice would challenge the lower court's reasoning was correct but far too simplistic. The Merits Brief lays out a precise, two-pronged attack on the Eleventh Circuit's ruling, directly corresponding to the \"Questions Presented\":\n    *   **On the Supremacy Clause:** The petitioners argue that the Eleventh Circuit's holding (stemming from its precedent in *Denson v. United States*) that the Supremacy Clause bars an FTCA claim is nonsensical. Their logic is that the FTCA is itself a federal statute and therefore part of the \"supreme Law of the Land.\" Barring a federal claim with the Supremacy Clause is a paradox. This appears to be a very strong, potentially dispositive, argument.\n    *   **On the FTCA Exceptions:** The petitioners argue that the discretionary function exception (28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2680(a)) and the law enforcement proviso to the intentional torts exception (\u00a7 2680(h)) are \"categorically\" separate. They contend that \u00a7 2680(a) applies to policy-based decisions, whereas \u00a7 2680(h) is a specific waiver of immunity for torts like assault and battery committed by law enforcement. They argue that the lower courts erred by even considering the discretionary function exception for a claim that falls squarely under the law enforcement proviso. They further argue that even if the two provisions did conflict, the specific proviso (\u00a7 2680(h)) should prevail over the general exception (\u00a7 2680(a)). This line of reasoning directly undermines the entire framework used by the Eleventh Circuit, which linked government liability to the \"reasonableness\" of the agents' actions\u2014a consideration more appropriate for qualified immunity or discretionary functions, not the specific torts listed in the proviso.\n\nMy task-level model has shifted from uncertainty about the questions to analyzing the strength of the answers provided by the petitioners. The focus of my prediction now moves to how the Supreme Court will likely receive these specific, well-defined arguments, and what the government's counter-arguments will be in its own Merits Brief.",
          "design_beliefs": "My research methodology continues to evolve through trial and error, becoming progressively more sophisticated. My previous update established a robust research cycle (**Plan -> Locate -> Retrieve & Verify -> Synthesize -> Refine Plan**) and the critical heuristics **\"Verify Your Assets\"** and **\"A pointer is not data.\"** This latest observation validates and adds new layers to that framework.\n\n1.  **Structured Search is Effective:** My use of a `CLOSED_SEARCH` with `field_filters` (`proceeding_title`, `link_name`) proved to be a powerful technique. While it did not return the *exact* document I queried for (the Cert Petition), it returned a document of the correct *type* (a primary brief) that was even more valuable. This confirms that refining search queries with structured parameters is a high-yield strategy.\n\n2.  **Embrace Serendipitous Discovery:** The search for an older document (the cert petition) yielded a newer, more informative one (the merits brief). This is a crucial lesson. The goal of a search is to reduce uncertainty, not necessarily to find one specific, pre-determined file. This leads to a new heuristic: **\"Be prepared for valuable near-misses.\"** A search result that is adjacent to the target may provide more current or more potent information.\n\n3.  **Scrutinize Metadata Before Content:** The filename `20250307...Merits20Brief.json` was an immediate and powerful signal. The future date and the term \"Merits Brief\" told me the case status had advanced dramatically *before* I even read the first line of the document. This elevates a prior sub-heuristic into a core principle: **Metadata is not just descriptive; it is evidentiary.** Dates, document types, and titles can provide critical context and shortcuts to understanding.\n\n4.  **Develop Templates for Synthesis:** Successfully acquiring a complex legal document like a merits brief is only half the battle. The `Synthesize` phase of my research cycle requires its own methodology. Based on this observation, an effective approach is to **deconstruct legal briefs into their core components: Questions Presented, Theory of the Case, Key Precedents (supportive and adverse), and Statutory/Textual Arguments.** This provides a structured way to extract the essential legal logic and predict how it will be received.\n\nMy refined design now incorporates a greater appreciation for the nuances of my search tools, an openness to unexpected results, a heightened focus on metadata as a primary source of information, and a more structured approach to analyzing the content of retrieved legal documents. The cycle remains the same, but the execution of each step has become more intelligent and efficient."

App. \n34a-68a) is reported at 631 F. Supp. 3d. 1281.  \nJURISDICTION \nThe judgment of the court of appeals was entered on \nApril 22, 2024.  A petition for rehearing was denied on \nMay 30, 2024. (Pet. App. 70a-71a).  On July 22, 2024, \nJustice Thomas extended the time within which to file a \npetition for a writ of certiorari to and including Septem-\nber 27, 2024, and the petition was filed on that day.  The \njurisdiction of this Court is invoked under 28 U.S.C. \n1254(1). \n\n2 \n \nSTATEMENT \n1. The Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA), 28 U.S.C. \n1346(b), 2671 et seq., enacted in 1946, generally waives \nthe sovereign immunity of the United States and cre-\nates a cause of action for damages against the United \nStates with respect to certain torts of federal employ-\nees, acting within the scope of their employment, under \ncircumstances in which a private individual would be li-\nable under state law.  See 28 U.S.C. 1346(b)(1).  The \nFTCA contains various exceptions that limit the waiver \nof sovereign immunity and the substantive scope of the \nUnited States\u2019 liability, including an exception for any \nclaim \u201cbased upon the exercise or performance or the \nfailure to exercise or perform a discretionary function \nor duty on the part of a federal agency or an employee \nof the Government, whether or not the discretion in-\nvolved be abused.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 2680(a).   \nThe FTCA also excludes from its waiver of sovereign \nimmunity most intentional torts:  \u201c[a]ny claim arising \nout of assault, battery, false imprisonment, false arrest, \nmalicious prosecution, abuse of process, libel, slander, \nmisrepresentation, deceit, or interference with contract \nrights.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 2680(h).  In 1974, Congress added a \nproviso to the intentional tort exception, known as the \nlaw enforcement proviso.  See Act of Mar. 16, 1974, Pub. \nL. No. 93-253, \u00a7 2, 88 Stat. 50.  The law enforcement \nproviso states that \u201cthe provisions of this chapter and \nsection 1346(b) of this title shall apply to any claim aris-\ning  * * *  out of assault, battery, false imprisonment, \nfalse arrest, abuse of process, or malicious prosecution\u201d \nthat is based on \u201cacts or omissions of investigative or \nlaw enforcement officers of the United States Govern-\nment.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 2680(h). \n\n3 \n \n2. In 2015, the Federal Bureau of Investigation \n(FBI) initiated an operation concerning violent gang ac-\ntivity in Georgia.  Pet. App. 4a.  The operation ultimately \nresulted in the criminal indictment of several individu-\nals, including Joseph Riley.  Id. at 3a-4a.  Officers ob-\ntained warrants for Riley\u2019s arrest and for the search of \nhis home at 3741 Landau Lane SW, Atlanta, Georgia \n30331.  Id. at 4a.     \nThe FBI assigned Special Agent Lawrence Guerra \nto lead a Special Weapons and Tactics (SWAT) team in \nthe execution of the search warrant.  Pet. App. 4a-5a.  \nThe FBI has a standard operating procedure that re-\nquires its agents to conduct a site survey or a drive-by \nbefore executing a high-risk warrant, such as the one \nfor Riley\u2019s arrest.  Id. at 5a.  The FBI, however, does \nnot have any policies that govern how to locate or navi-\ngate to a target address.  Ibid.   \nGuerra took several steps in preparation to execute \nthe warrant.  He reviewed information that other FBI \nagents had obtained through surveillance of Riley and \n3741 Landau Lane.  Pet. App. 4a-6a.  He conducted a \nsite survey of 3741 Landau Lane, during which he took \nphotographs and identified specific features of the home \nso that he could locate the property when executing the \nwarrant in the early morning.  Id. at 5a.  Guerra noted \nthat the house was beige and split-level, located on a \ncorner lot, had a driveway and garage facing a separate \nstreet that ran perpendicular to the front door, and had \na large tree in the front corner of the property.  Ibid.  \nGuerra also wrote tactical notes outlining how his team \nwould execute the warrant, and he attended an opera-\ntional briefing, which included presentations on and \nphotographs of Riley and 3741 Landau Lane.  Id. at 6a.  \n\n4 \n \nIn the pre-dawn hours of October 18, 2017, Guerra \nconducted a further drive-by with FBI Special Agent \nMichael Lemoine.  Pet. App. 4a, 6a.  Navigating in com-\nplete darkness, Guerra used his personal GPS device to \nlocate 3741 Landau Lane.  Ibid.  When the GPS unit \nalerted that they had arrived at 3741 Landau Lane, \nGuerra observed what he believed to be the same house \nhe had seen during his previous site survey: the home \nwas beige and split-level, located on a corner lot, had a \ntight stairway and stoop leading to the front door with \nwindows on either side, had a driveway and garage fac-\ning a separate street that ran perpendicular to the front \ndoor, and had a large tree in the front corner of the \nproperty.  Id. at 6a-7a.  Guerra also observed a black \nCamaro in the driveway, which he would later use as a \nreference point to locate 3741 Landau Lane.  Id. at 7a.   \nUnbeknownst to Guerra and Lemoine, however, the \nGPS had directed them to a different home\u20143756 Den-\nville Trace, petitioners\u2019 residence.  Pet. App. 6a-7a.  Pe-\ntitioners\u2019 home at 3756 Denville Trace faces Landau \nLane and is a few houses (approximately 436 feet) from \n3741 Landau Lane.  Ibid.  The house number does not \nappear on the house itself; instead, it appears on the \nmailbox and is not visible from the street.  Id. at 7a.   \nThe same day\u2014and while it was still dark out\u2014\nGuerra, Lemoine, and other agents left for 3741 Landau \nLane in a caravan of vehicles.  Pet. App. 7a.  Guerra \nidentified what he believed to be 3741 Landau Lane \nbased on the black Camaro, his prior preparation, and \nthe morning drive-by.  Ibid.  He directed that his vehicle \nstop in front of the house, and the other vehicles fol-\nlowed suit.  Ibid.  The members of the SWAT team then \nassembled in their positions, and after Guerra knocked \n\n5 \n \nand announced the presence of law enforcement, agents \nentered the home.  Id. at 7a-8a.  \nThe agents were in the home for approximately five \nminutes before realizing their mistake.  Pet. App. 39a.  \nDuring that time, the SWAT team members found peti-\ntioners Hilliard Toi Cliatt and Curtrina Martin in a \ncloset, where Cliatt kept a shotgun for protection.  Id. \nat 3a, 8a.  With their guns pointed, agents pulled Cliatt \nout of the closet and placed him in handcuffs.  Id. at 8a.   \nA SWAT team member also pointed a gun at Martin \nwhile instructing her to keep her hands up.  Ibid.  Shortly \nafter detaining Cliatt, however, the officers realized \nthat they had entered the wrong house.  Ibid.  An agent \nimmediately lifted Cliatt from the ground and uncuffed \nhim.  Ibid.  Guerra advised petitioners that he would re-\nturn to explain what had happened.  Id. at 8a-9a.   \nThe agents promptly executed the search warrant at \n3741 Landau Lane, making an arrest of Riley as he at-\ntempted to flee.  Pet. App. 9a.  Once Riley and 3741 Lan-\ndau Lane were secured, Guerra returned to petitioners\u2019 \nhome, where he apologized, provided his business card \nand the name of his supervisor, documented the damage \nto the home, and advised petitioners that the FBI would \nhandle the damages repairs.  Ibid.  \n3. In September 2019, petitioners brought suit \nagainst the United States under the FTCA.  Pet. App. \n9a.  Petitioners raised several claims based on state tort \nlaw, including, as relevant here, negligence, negli-\ngent/intentional infliction of emotional distress, tres-\npass and interference with private property, false im-\nprisonment, and assault and battery.  Ibid.1  \n \n1  Petitioners also brought a claim against Guerra under Bivens v. \nSix Unknown Named Agents of Federal Bureau of Narcotics, 403 \n \n\n6 \n \nThe district court granted in part the government\u2019s \nmotion for summary judgment.  Pet. App. 34a-68a.  The \ncourt held that the discretionary function exception in \nthe FTCA barred petitioners\u2019 claims for negligence, \nnegligent/intentional infliction of emotional distress, \ntrespass and interference with private property.  Id. at \n58a.  The court denied summary judgment, however, \nwith respect to two claims\u2014for false imprisonment and \nfor assault and battery\u2014that involved torts listed in the \nlaw enforcement proviso.  Id. at 59a-60a.  The court ex-\nplained that under Eleventh Circuit precedent, claims \nthat implicate the law enforcement proviso may proceed \neven if the acts giving rise to the claim involve a discre-\ntionary function.  Ibid.; see Nguyen v. United States, \n556 F.3d 1244, 1256 (11th Cir. 2009).   \nUpon a motion for reconsideration, the district court \ngranted the government\u2019s motion for summary judg-\nment in full and dismissed the complaint.  Pet. App. 21a-\n32a.  In its reconsideration order, the court, applying \nrecent Eleventh Circuit precedent, held that the Su-\npremacy Clause of the Constitution precluded petition-\ners from bringing their false imprisonment and assault \nand battery claims against the United States.  Id. at \n26a-27a (citing Kordash v. United States, 51 F.4th 1289 \n(11th Cir. 2022)).   \n4. The court of appeals affirmed in an unpublished, \nper curiam decision.  See Pet. App. 2a-19a.   \nThe court of appeals first held that the discretionary \nfunction exception barred petitioners\u2019 claims for torts \n \nU.S. 388 (1971), alleging that Guerra\u2019s mistaken execution of the \nwarrant at their house had violated their Fourth Amendment rights.  \nPet. App. 9a.  The court of appeals affirmed the dismissal of that \nclaim on qualified immunity grounds.  Id. at 13a-15a.  Petitioners do \nnot seek review of that holding.  See Pet. 10 n.1.     \n\n7 \n \nthat were not listed in the law enforcement proviso, i.e., \n\u201ctrespass and interference with private property,     \nnegligent/intentional infliction of emotional distress, \nand negligence.\u201d  Pet. App. 17a.  The court explained \nthat the discretionary function exception to the FTCA \n\u201cexempts from liability state-tort claims arising from a \ngovernment official\u2019s performance of a duty or function \nthat involves discretion.\u201d  Id. at 16a.  And here, the court \nobserved, Guerra \u201cenjoyed discretion\u201d under FBI poli-\ncies as to how to prepare for the execution of the war-\nrant, and his decision was \u201c\u200a\u2018susceptible to policy analy-\nsis,\u2019\u200a\u201d id. at 17a-18a (quoting Mesa v. United States, 123 \nF.3d 1435, 1438 (11th Cir. 1997)).   \nThe court of appeals also affirmed the dismissal of \npetitioners\u2019 false imprisonment and assault and battery \nclaims.  The court held that the Supremacy Clause, \n\u201c[s]imilar to the discretionary function exception,\u201d \u201cen-\nsures that states do not impede or burden the execution \nof federal law.\u201d  Pet. App. 16a.  Under circuit precedent, \n\u201c[t]he government may invoke the Supremacy Clause \nagainst state-tort liability\u201d if it demonstrates that the \nofficial\u2019s acts (i) \u201c\u200a\u2018have some nexus with furthering fed-\neral policy\u2019\u200a\u201d and (ii) \u201c\u200a\u2018can reasonably be characterized \nas complying with the full range of federal law.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Id. at \n17a (quoting Kordash, 51 F.4th at 1293).  The court held \nthat Guerra\u2019s acts had a \u201c\u200a\u2018nexus with furthering federal \npolicy\u2019\u200a\u201d because there was \u201cno doubt that Guerra acted \nwithin the scope of his discretionary authority when he \nprepared for and executed the search warrant.\u201d  Id. at \n19a (citation omitted).  And the court concluded that \nGuerra\u2019s actions complied with the \u201cfull range\u201d of fed-\neral law because he did not \u201cviolate[] the Fourth Amend-\nment.\u201d  Ibid.  The court explained that \u201can officer who \nmakes \u2018reasonable effort[s] to ascertain and identify \n\n8 \n \nthe\u2019 target address of a valid search warrant complies \nwith the Fourth Amendment,\u201d and \u201cthe decisions that \nGuerra made,\u201d while mistaken, were the \u201ckind of rea-\nsonable mistakes that the Fourth Amendment contem-\nplates,\u201d as they involved the execution of \u201ca high-risk \nwarrant\u201d in a \u201crapidly-changing and dangerous situa-\ntion.\u201d  Id. at 13a-14a (citation omitted; brackets in orig-\ninal).   \nARGUMENT \nPetitioners contend (Pet. 23-34) that the court of ap-\npeals misapplied the discretionary function exception in \nSection 2680(a) to dismiss their claims for trespass, in-\nterference with private property, negligent/intentional \ninfliction of emotional distress, and negligence.  That \ncontention lacks merit.  The court of appeals correctly \nheld (Pet. App. 15a-18a) that the discretionary function \nexception barred those claims, and its factbound and \nnonprecedential decision is consistent with decisions of \nthis Court and other courts of appeals.   \nPetitioners further contend (Pet. 16-23) that the \ncourt of appeals erred in affirming the dismissal of their \nclaims for false imprisonment and assault and battery.  \nPetitioners correctly observe that the court\u2019s reasoning \nfor rejecting those claims differs from the approach of \nother circuits, but that disagreement did not affect the \nproper disposition of the case.  The court correctly held \nthat petitioners\u2019 claims are barred, and no court of ap-\npeals to have addressed the issue would have reached a \ndifferent result.  Accordingly, this Court\u2019s review is not \nwarranted.     \n1. The court of appeals correctly held that the dis-\ncretionary function exception to the FTCA bars peti-\ntioners\u2019 claims for trespass and interference with pri-\n\n9 \n \nvate property, negligent/intentional infliction of emo-\ntional distress, and negligence.  Insofar as petitioners \nchallenge that holding, they do so on fact-specific \ngrounds, and their effort to identify relevant disagree-\nments among the courts of appeals is without merit.      \n \na. The FTCA\u2019s discretionary function exception pro-\nvides that the United States\u2019 waiver of sovereign im-\nmunity does not apply to claims based on an employee\u2019s \n\u201cexercise or performance or the failure to exercise or \nperform a discretionary function or duty  * * *, whether \nor not the discretion involved be abused.\u201d  28 U.S.C. \n2680(a).  The exception serves to \u201cprevent judicial \u2018sec-\nond-guessing\u200a\u2019 of legislative and administrative deci-\nsions  * * *  through the medium of an action in tort.\u201d  \nUnited States v. Gaubert, 499 U.S. 315, 323 (1991) (cita-\ntion omitted).   \nThis Court has established a two-part inquiry to \nguide application of the discretionary function excep-\ntion.  Gaubert, 499 U.S. at 322-323.  First, a court must \ndetermine whether the conduct challenged by the plain-\ntiff was \u201cdiscretionary in nature\u201d\u2014that is, whether it \ninvolved \u201c\u200a\u2018an element of judgment or choice.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Id. at \n322 (citation omitted).  \u201cThe requirement of judgment \nor choice is not satisfied if a \u2018federal statute, regulation, \nor policy specifically prescribes a course of action for an \nemployee to follow,\u2019 because \u2018the employee has no right-\nful option but to adhere to the directive.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Ibid. (quot-\ning Berkovitz v. United States, 486 U.S. 531, 536 (1988)).  \nSecond, a court must evaluate \u201cwhether that judgment \nis of the kind that the discretionary function exception \nwas designed to shield,\u201d id. at 322-323 (quoting Berkovitz, \n486 U.S. at 536), meaning it is \u201csusceptible to policy \nanalysis,\u201d id. at 325. \n\n10 \n \nGuerra\u2019s conduct in executing the search warrant \nsatisfied the Gaubert standard.  As the court of appeals \nobserved, the FBI did not have policies that \u201cdictate[d] \nhow agents are to prepare for warrant executions,\u201d and \nGuerra instead exercised discretion as to how to inves-\ntigate the location.  Pet. App. 18a (emphasis omitted).  \nThat decision required judgment:  an agent must weigh, \namong other things, \u201cthe urgency of apprehending the \nsubject,\u201d the need to \u201ckeep the investigation secret,\u201d \nand \u201cavailable resources\u201d in allocating agents across \n\u201cthe many investigations for which they are responsi-\nble.\u201d  Mesa v. United States, 123 F.3d 1435, 1438 (11th \nCir. 1997).  Here, Guerra faced a \u201crapidly-changing and \ndangerous situation,\u201d Pet. App. 14a, and he exercised \ndiscretion to conduct his drive-by in the dark, with the \nheadlights dimmed, to \u201cavoid detection\u201d before execut-\ning a high-risk warrant, id. at 37a.  While Guerra did \nnot have discretion to intentionally \u201craid the wrong \nhouse,\u201d Pet. 31, he did have discretion in determining \nthe preparatory steps necessary to \u201clocate and identify\u201d \nthe target address,\u201d Pet. App. 18a.    \nGuerra\u2019s conduct likewise satisfied the second com-\nponent of Gaubert\u2019s two-part inquiry because his \u201cdeci-\nsion as to how to locate and identify the subject of an \narrest warrant  * * *  is susceptible to policy analysis.\u201d  \nPet. App. 18a (quoting Mesa, 123 F.3d at 1438).  The \nfactors described above\u2014which include competing con-\nsiderations like officer and public safety, resource con-\nstraints, tactical considerations, and accuracy\u2014are all \n\u201cfundamentally rooted in policy considerations,\u201d for which \n\u201cjudicial second-guessing\u201d is not appropriate.  Mesa, 123 \nF.3d at 1438.  The court of appeals therefore correctly \nheld that Guerra\u2019s preparatory efforts here \u201cf\u200a[e]ll \n\n11 \n \nsquarely within the discretionary function exception.\u201d  \nPet. App. 18a (citation omitted).  \nb. Petitioners briefly contend (Pet. 28-30) that the \ncourt of appeals erred in holding that Guerra\u2019s execu-\ntion of the warrant was \u201csusceptible to policy analysis\u201d \nand thus \u201c\u200a\u2018of the kind that the discretionary function \nexception was designed to shield.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Gaubert, 499 U.S. \nat 322-323, 325 (citation omitted).  In petitioners\u2019 view \n(Pet. 30), the proper inquiry asks whether a federal em-\nployee\u2019s acts \u201cactually\u201d\u2014\u201cnot just hypothetically\u201d\u2014\nwere grounded in policy analysis.   \nThis Court has long since rejected the subjective \nstandard that petitioners advocate.  In Gaubert, this \nCourt explained that the \u201cfocus of the inquiry is not on \nthe agent\u2019s subjective intent in exercising the discretion \nconferred by statute or regulation, but on the nature of \nthe actions taken.\u201d  499 U.S. at 325.  Thus, the relevant \nquestion is not how an officer thinks about his or her \nconduct; the question is whether the conduct is of the \n\u201ckind\u201d that, by its nature, can be \u201cgrounded in the pol-\nicy of the regulatory regime.\u201d  Ibid. (emphasis added).  \nConsistent with that approach, the Eleventh Circuit fo-\ncused on the nature of Guerra\u2019s conduct, explaining that \n\u201ca federal officer\u2019s \u2018decision as to how to locate and iden-\ntify the subject of an arrest warrant\u2019\u200a\u201d is the kind of act \nthat requires discretion.  Pet. App. 18a (quoting Mesa, \n123 F.3d at 1438).   \nContrary to petitioners\u2019 assertion (Pet. 28-30), the \ncourts of appeals are unanimous, not divided, in follow-\ning this Court\u2019s guidance.  Petitioners recognize that \nnine circuits have held that an official\u2019s act need \u201cnot be \nactually grounded in policy considerations,\u201d so long as it \nis, \u201cby its nature, susceptible to a policy analysis.\u201d  Pet. \n28 (quoting Miller v. United States, 163 F.3d 591, 593 \n\n12 \n \n(9th Cir. 1998)).  And contrary to petitioners\u2019 contention \n(Pet. 28-30), the Third Circuit likewise examines the \n\u201cnature of the actions taken,\u201d not the \u201csubjective in-\ntent\u201d of the agent.  Baer v. United States, 722 F.3d 168, \n175 (2013) (quoting Gaubert, 499 U.S. at 325) (emphasis \nomitted); see Middleton v. United States Fed. Bureau \nof Prisons, 658 Fed. Appx. 167, 169-170 (3d Cir. 2016) \n(per curiam) (concluding that task was susceptible to \npolicy analysis without considering whether officials ac-\ntually engaged in such analysis).  \nc. Petitioners also maintain that review is warranted \nto resolve two disagreements among the courts of ap-\npeal as to how the discretionary function exception ap-\nplies.  That contention is meritless.  To the extent any \ndisagreements exists among the courts of appeals, this \ncase does not implicate them.   \ni. Petitioners contend (Pet. 31-33) that the courts of \nappeals disagree on whether the discretionary function \nexception is applicable where a federal employee\u2019s con-\nduct runs afoul of the Constitution.  That question played \nno role in the court of appeals\u2019 decision.  The court held \nthat \u201cGuerra\u2019s actions did not violate the Fourth Amend-\nment.\u201d  Pet. App. 19a.  In particular, the Court concluded \nthat that Guerra\u2019s actions \u201cconstitute[d] the kind of rea-\nsonable mistakes that the Fourth Amendment contem-\nplates.\u201d  Id. at 14a.  Petitioners do not challenge that fact-\nbound determination, see Pet. i, and this case therefore \npresents no opportunity to resolve any differences \namong the courts of appeals as to the application of the \ndiscretionary function exception to unconstitutional \nconduct.2 \n \n2 Petitioners argue that the court of appeals spoke \u201cimprecise[ly]\u201d \nwhen it stated that \u201c\u200a\u2018Guerra\u2019s \n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

(Pet. App. 70a-71a).  On July 22, 2024, \nJustice Thomas extended the time within which to file a \npetition for a writ of certiorari to and including Septem-\nber 27, 2024, and the petition was filed on that day.  The \njurisdiction of this Court is invoked under 28 U.S.C. \n1254(1). \n\n2 \n \nSTATEMENT \n1. The Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA), 28 U.S.C. \n1346(b), 2671 et seq., enacted in 1946, generally waives \nthe sovereign immunity of the United States and cre-\nates a cause of action for damages against the United \nStates with respect to certain torts of federal employ-\nees, acting within the scope of their employment, under \ncircumstances in which a private individual would be li-\nable under state law.  See 28 U.S.C. 1346(b)(1).  The \nFTCA contains various exceptions that limit the waiver \nof sovereign immunity and the substantive scope of the \nUnited States\u2019 liability, including an exception for any \nclaim \u201cbased upon the exercise or performance or the \nfailure to exercise or perform a discretionary function \nor duty on the part of a federal agency or an employee \nof the Government, whether or not the discretion in-\nvolved be abused.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 2680(a).   \nThe FTCA also excludes from its waiver of sovereign \nimmunity most intentional torts:  \u201c[a]ny claim arising \nout of assault, battery, false imprisonment, false arrest, \nmalicious prosecution, abuse of process, libel, slander, \nmisrepresentation, deceit, or interference with contract \nrights.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 2680(h).  In 1974, Congress added a \nproviso to the intentional tort exception, known as the \nlaw enforcement proviso.  See Act of Mar. 16, 1974, Pub. \nL. No. 93-253, \u00a7 2, 88 Stat. 50.  The law enforcement \nproviso states that \u201cthe provisions of this chapter and \nsection 1346(b) of this title shall apply to any claim aris-\ning  * * *  out of assault, battery, false imprisonment, \nfalse arrest, abuse of process, or malicious prosecution\u201d \nthat is based on \u201cacts or omissions of investigative or \nlaw enforcement officers of the United States Govern-\nment.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 2680(h). \n\n3 \n \n2. In 2015, the Federal Bureau of Investigation \n(FBI) initiated an operation concerning violent gang ac-\ntivity in Georgia.  Pet. App. 4a.  The operation ultimately \nresulted in the criminal indictment of several individu-\nals, including Joseph Riley.  Id. at 3a-4a.  Officers ob-\ntained warrants for Riley\u2019s arrest and for the search of \nhis home at 3741 Landau Lane SW, Atlanta, Georgia \n30331.  Id. at 4a.     \nThe FBI assigned Special Agent Lawrence Guerra \nto lead a Special Weapons and Tactics (SWAT) team in \nthe execution of the search warrant.  Pet. App. 4a-5a.  \nThe FBI has a standard operating procedure that re-\nquires its agents to conduct a site survey or a drive-by \nbefore executing a high-risk warrant, such as the one \nfor Riley\u2019s arrest.  Id. at 5a.  The FBI, however, does \nnot have any policies that govern how to locate or navi-\ngate to a target address.  Ibid.   \nGuerra took several steps in preparation to execute \nthe warrant.  He reviewed information that other FBI \nagents had obtained through surveillance of Riley and \n3741 Landau Lane.  Pet. App. 4a-6a.  He conducted a \nsite survey of 3741 Landau Lane, during which he took \nphotographs and identified specific features of the home \nso that he could locate the property when executing the \nwarrant in the early morning.  Id. at 5a.  Guerra noted \nthat the house was beige and split-level, located on a \ncorner lot, had a driveway and garage facing a separate \nstreet that ran perpendicular to the front door, and had \na large tree in the front corner of the property.  Ibid.  \nGuerra also wrote tactical notes outlining how his team \nwould execute the warrant, and he attended an opera-\ntional briefing, which included presentations on and \nphotographs of Riley and 3741 Landau Lane.  Id. at 6a.  \n\n4 \n \nIn the pre-dawn hours of October 18, 2017, Guerra \nconducted a further drive-by with FBI Special Agent \nMichael Lemoine.  Pet. App. 4a, 6a.  Navigating in com-\nplete darkness, Guerra used his personal GPS device to \nlocate 3741 Landau Lane.  Ibid.  When the GPS unit \nalerted that they had arrived at 3741 Landau Lane, \nGuerra observed what he believed to be the same house \nhe had seen during his previous site survey: the home \nwas beige and split-level, located on a corner lot, had a \ntight stairway and stoop leading to the front door with \nwindows on either side, had a driveway and garage fac-\ning a separate street that ran perpendicular to the front \ndoor, and had a large tree in the front corner of the \nproperty.  Id. at 6a-7a.  Guerra also observed a black \nCamaro in the driveway, which he would later use as a \nreference point to locate 3741 Landau Lane.  Id. at 7a.   \nUnbeknownst to Guerra and Lemoine, however, the \nGPS had directed them to a different home\u20143756 Den-\nville Trace, petitioners\u2019 residence.  Pet. App. 6a-7a.  Pe-\ntitioners\u2019 home at 3756 Denville Trace faces Landau \nLane and is a few houses (approximately 436 feet) from \n3741 Landau Lane.  Ibid.  The house number does not \nappear on the house itself; instead, it appears on the \nmailbox and is not visible from the street.  Id. at 7a.   \nThe same day\u2014and while it was still dark out\u2014\nGuerra, Lemoine, and other agents left for 3741 Landau \nLane in a caravan of vehicles.  Pet. App. 7a.  Guerra \nidentified what he believed to be 3741 Landau Lane \nbased on the black Camaro, his prior preparation, and \nthe morning drive-by.  Ibid.  He directed that his vehicle \nstop in front of the house, and the other vehicles fol-\nlowed suit.  Ibid.  The members of the SWAT team then \nassembled in their positions, and after Guerra knocked \n\n5 \n \nand announced the presence of law enforcement, agents \nentered the home.  Id. at 7a-8a.  \nThe agents were in the home for approximately five \nminutes before realizing their mistake.  Pet. App. 39a.  \nDuring that time, the SWAT team members found peti-\ntioners Hilliard Toi Cliatt and Curtrina Martin in a \ncloset, where Cliatt kept a shotgun for protection.  Id. \nat 3a, 8a.  With their guns pointed, agents pulled Cliatt \nout of the closet and placed him in handcuffs.  Id. at 8a.   \nA SWAT team member also pointed a gun at Martin \nwhile instructing her to keep her hands up.  Ibid.  Shortly \nafter detaining Cliatt, however, the officers realized \nthat they had entered the wrong house.  Ibid.  An agent \nimmediately lifted Cliatt from the ground and uncuffed \nhim.  Ibid.  Guerra advised petitioners that he would re-\nturn to explain what had happened.  Id. at 8a-9a.   \nThe agents promptly executed the search warrant at \n3741 Landau Lane, making an arrest of Riley as he at-\ntempted to flee.  Pet. App. 9a.  Once Riley and 3741 Lan-\ndau Lane were secured, Guerra returned to petitioners\u2019 \nhome, where he apologized, provided his business card \nand the name of his supervisor, documented the damage \nto the home, and advised petitioners that the FBI would \nhandle the damages repairs.  Ibid.  \n3. In September 2019, petitioners brought suit \nagainst the United States under the FTCA.  Pet. App. \n9a.  Petitioners raised several claims based on state tort \nlaw, including, as relevant here, negligence, negli-\ngent/intentional infliction of emotional distress, tres-\npass and interference with private property, false im-\nprisonment, and assault and battery.  Ibid.1  \n \n1  Petitioners also brought a claim against Guerra under Bivens v. \nSix Unknown Named Agents of Federal Bureau of Narcotics, 403 \n \n\n6 \n \nThe district court granted in part the government\u2019s \nmotion for summary judgment.  Pet. App. 34a-68a.  The \ncourt held that the discretionary function exception in \nthe FTCA barred petitioners\u2019 claims for negligence, \nnegligent/intentional infliction of emotional distress, \ntrespass and interference with private property.  Id. at \n58a.  The court denied summary judgment, however, \nwith respect to two claims\u2014for false imprisonment and \nfor assault and battery\u2014that involved torts listed in the \nlaw enforcement proviso.  Id. at 59a-60a.  The court ex-\nplained that under Eleventh Circuit precedent, claims \nthat implicate the law enforcement proviso may proceed \neven if the acts giving rise to the claim involve a discre-\ntionary function.  Ibid.; see Nguyen v. United States, \n556 F.3d 1244, 1256 (11th Cir. 2009).   \nUpon a motion for reconsideration, the district court \ngranted the government\u2019s motion for summary judg-\nment in full and dismissed the complaint.  Pet. App. 21a-\n32a.  In its reconsideration order, the court, applying \nrecent Eleventh Circuit precedent, held that the Su-\npremacy Clause of the Constitution precluded petition-\ners from bringing their false imprisonment and assault \nand battery claims against the United States.  Id. at \n26a-27a (citing Kordash v. United States, 51 F.4th 1289 \n(11th Cir. 2022)).   \n4. The court of appeals affirmed in an unpublished, \nper curiam decision.  See Pet. App. 2a-19a.   \nThe court of appeals first held that the discretionary \nfunction exception barred petitioners\u2019 claims for torts \n \nU.S. 388 (1971), alleging that Guerra\u2019s mistaken execution of the \nwarrant at their house had violated their Fourth Amendment rights.  \nPet. App. 9a.  The court of appeals affirmed the dismissal of that \nclaim on qualified immunity grounds.  Id. at 13a-15a.  Petitioners do \nnot seek review of that holding.  See Pet. 10 n.1.     \n\n7 \n \nthat were not listed in the law enforcement proviso, i.e., \n\u201ctrespass and interference with private property,     \nnegligent/intentional infliction of emotional distress, \nand negligence.\u201d  Pet. App. 17a.  The court explained \nthat the discretionary function exception to the FTCA \n\u201cexempts from liability state-tort claims arising from a \ngovernment official\u2019s performance of a duty or function \nthat involves discretion.\u201d  Id. at 16a.  And here, the court \nobserved, Guerra \u201cenjoyed discretion\u201d under FBI poli-\ncies as to how to prepare for the execution of the war-\nrant, and his decision was \u201c\u200a\u2018susceptible to policy analy-\nsis,\u2019\u200a\u201d id. at 17a-18a (quoting Mesa v. United States, 123 \nF.3d 1435, 1438 (11th Cir. 1997)).   \nThe court of appeals also affirmed the dismissal of \npetitioners\u2019 false imprisonment and assault and battery \nclaims.  The court held that the Supremacy Clause, \n\u201c[s]imilar to the discretionary function exception,\u201d \u201cen-\nsures that states do not impede or burden the execution \nof federal law.\u201d  Pet. App. 16a.  Under circuit precedent, \n\u201c[t]he government may invoke the Supremacy Clause \nagainst state-tort liability\u201d if it demonstrates that the \nofficial\u2019s acts (i) \u201c\u200a\u2018have some nexus with furthering fed-\neral policy\u2019\u200a\u201d and (ii) \u201c\u200a\u2018can reasonably be characterized \nas complying with the full range of federal law.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Id. at \n17a (quoting Kordash, 51 F.4th at 1293).  The court held \nthat Guerra\u2019s acts had a \u201c\u200a\u2018nexus with furthering federal \npolicy\u2019\u200a\u201d because there was \u201cno doubt that Guerra acted \nwithin the scope of his discretionary authority when he \nprepared for and executed the search warrant.\u201d  Id. at \n19a (citation omitted).  And the court concluded that \nGuerra\u2019s actions complied with the \u201cfull range\u201d of fed-\neral law because he did not \u201cviolate[] the Fourth Amend-\nment.\u201d  Ibid.  The court explained that \u201can officer who \nmakes \u2018reasonable effort[s] to ascertain and identify \n\n8 \n \nthe\u2019 target address of a valid search warrant complies \nwith the Fourth Amendment,\u201d and \u201cthe decisions that \nGuerra made,\u201d while mistaken, were the \u201ckind of rea-\nsonable mistakes that the Fourth Amendment contem-\nplates,\u201d as they involved the execution of \u201ca high-risk \nwarrant\u201d in a \u201crapidly-changing and dangerous situa-\ntion.\u201d  Id. at 13a-14a (citation omitted; brackets in orig-\ninal).   \nARGUMENT \nPetitioners contend (Pet. 23-34) that the court of ap-\npeals misapplied the discretionary function exception in \nSection 2680(a) to dismiss their claims for trespass, in-\nterference with private property, negligent/intentional \ninfliction of emotional distress, and negligence.  That \ncontention lacks merit.  The court of appeals correctly \nheld (Pet. App. 15a-18a) that the discretionary function \nexception barred those claims, and its factbound and \nnonprecedential decision is consistent with decisions of \nthis Court and other courts of appeals.   \nPetitioners further contend (Pet. 16-23) that the \ncourt of appeals erred in affirming the dismissal of their \nclaims for false imprisonment and assault and battery.  \nPetitioners correctly observe that the court\u2019s reasoning \nfor rejecting those claims differs from the approach of \nother circuits, but that disagreement did not affect the \nproper disposition of the case.  The court correctly held \nthat petitioners\u2019 claims are barred, and no court of ap-\npeals to have addressed the issue would have reached a \ndifferent result.  Accordingly, this Court\u2019s review is not \nwarranted.     \n1. The court of appeals correctly held that the dis-\ncretionary function exception to the FTCA bars peti-\ntioners\u2019 claims for trespass and interference with pri-\n\n9 \n \nvate property, negligent/intentional infliction of emo-\ntional distress, and negligence.  Insofar as petitioners \nchallenge that holding, they do so on fact-specific \ngrounds, and their effort to identify relevant disagree-\nments among the courts of appeals is without merit.      \n \na. The FTCA\u2019s discretionary function exception pro-\nvides that the United States\u2019 waiver of sovereign im-\nmunity does not apply to claims based on an employee\u2019s \n\u201cexercise or performance or the failure to exercise or \nperform a discretionary function or duty  * * *, whether \nor not the discretion involved be abused.\u201d  28 U.S.C. \n2680(a).  The exception serves to \u201cprevent judicial \u2018sec-\nond-guessing\u200a\u2019 of legislative and administrative deci-\nsions  * * *  through the medium of an action in tort.\u201d  \nUnited States v. Gaubert, 499 U.S. 315, 323 (1991) (cita-\ntion omitted).   \nThis Court has established a two-part inquiry to \nguide application of the discretionary function excep-\ntion.  Gaubert, 499 U.S. at 322-323.  First, a court must \ndetermine whether the conduct challenged by the plain-\ntiff was \u201cdiscretionary in nature\u201d\u2014that is, whether it \ninvolved \u201c\u200a\u2018an element of judgment or choice.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Id. at \n322 (citation omitted).  \u201cThe requirement of judgment \nor choice is not satisfied if a \u2018federal statute, regulation, \nor policy specifically prescribes a course of action for an \nemployee to follow,\u2019 because \u2018the employee has no right-\nful option but to adhere to the directive.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Ibid. (quot-\ning Berkovitz v. United States, 486 U.S. 531, 536 (1988)).  \nSecond, a court must evaluate \u201cwhether that judgment \nis of the kind that the discretionary function exception \nwas designed to shield,\u201d id. at 322-323 (quoting Berkovitz, \n486 U.S. at 536), meaning it is \u201csusceptible to policy \nanalysis,\u201d id. at 325. \n\n10 \n \nGuerra\u2019s conduct in executing the search warrant \nsatisfied the Gaubert standard.  As the court of appeals \nobserved, the FBI did not have policies that \u201cdictate[d] \nhow agents are to prepare for warrant executions,\u201d and \nGuerra instead exercised discretion as to how to inves-\ntigate the location.  Pet. App. 18a (emphasis omitted).  \nThat decision required judgment:  an agent must weigh, \namong other things, \u201cthe urgency of apprehending the \nsubject,\u201d the need to \u201ckeep the investigation secret,\u201d \nand \u201cavailable resources\u201d in allocating agents across \n\u201cthe many investigations for which they are responsi-\nble.\u201d  Mesa v. United States, 123 F.3d 1435, 1438 (11th \nCir. 1997).  Here, Guerra faced a \u201crapidly-changing and \ndangerous situation,\u201d Pet. App. 14a, and he exercised \ndiscretion to conduct his drive-by in the dark, with the \nheadlights dimmed, to \u201cavoid detection\u201d before execut-\ning a high-risk warrant, id. at 37a.  While Guerra did \nnot have discretion to intentionally \u201craid the wrong \nhouse,\u201d Pet. 31, he did have discretion in determining \nthe preparatory steps necessary to \u201clocate and identify\u201d \nthe target address,\u201d Pet. App. 18a.    \nGuerra\u2019s conduct likewise satisfied the second com-\nponent of Gaubert\u2019s two-part inquiry because his \u201cdeci-\nsion as to how to locate and identify the subject of an \narrest warrant  * * *  is susceptible to policy analysis.\u201d  \nPet. App. 18a (quoting Mesa, 123 F.3d at 1438).  The \nfactors described above\u2014which include competing con-\nsiderations like officer and public safety, resource con-\nstraints, tactical considerations, and accuracy\u2014are all \n\u201cfundamentally rooted in policy considerations,\u201d for which \n\u201cjudicial second-guessing\u201d is not appropriate.  Mesa, 123 \nF.3d at 1438.  The court of appeals therefore correctly \nheld that Guerra\u2019s preparatory efforts here \u201cf\u200a[e]ll \n\n11 \n \nsquarely within the discretionary function exception.\u201d  \nPet. App. 18a (citation omitted).  \nb. Petitioners briefly contend (Pet. 28-30) that the \ncourt of appeals erred in holding that Guerra\u2019s execu-\ntion of the warrant was \u201csusceptible to policy analysis\u201d \nand thus \u201c\u200a\u2018of the kind that the discretionary function \nexception was designed to shield.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Gaubert, 499 U.S. \nat 322-323, 325 (citation omitted).  In petitioners\u2019 view \n(Pet. 30), the proper inquiry asks whether a federal em-\nployee\u2019s acts \u201cactually\u201d\u2014\u201cnot just hypothetically\u201d\u2014\nwere grounded in policy analysis.   \nThis Court has long since rejected the subjective \nstandard that petitioners advocate.  In Gaubert, this \nCourt explained that the \u201cfocus of the inquiry is not on \nthe agent\u2019s subjective intent in exercising the discretion \nconferred by statute or regulation, but on the nature of \nthe actions taken.\u201d  499 U.S. at 325.  Thus, the relevant \nquestion is not how an officer thinks about his or her \nconduct; the question is whether the conduct is of the \n\u201ckind\u201d that, by its nature, can be \u201cgrounded in the pol-\nicy of the regulatory regime.\u201d  Ibid. (emphasis added).  \nConsistent with that approach, the Eleventh Circuit fo-\ncused on the nature of Guerra\u2019s conduct, explaining that \n\u201ca federal officer\u2019s \u2018decision as to how to locate and iden-\ntify the subject of an arrest warrant\u2019\u200a\u201d is the kind of act \nthat requires discretion.  Pet. App. 18a (quoting Mesa, \n123 F.3d at 1438).   \nContrary to petitioners\u2019 assertion (Pet. 28-30), the \ncourts of appeals are unanimous, not divided, in follow-\ning this Court\u2019s guidance.  Petitioners recognize that \nnine circuits have held that an official\u2019s act need \u201cnot be \nactually grounded in policy considerations,\u201d so long as it \nis, \u201cby its nature, susceptible to a policy analysis.\u201d  Pet. \n28 (quoting Miller v. United States, 163 F.3d 591, 593 \n\n12 \n \n(9th Cir. 1998)).  And contrary to petitioners\u2019 contention \n(Pet. 28-30), the Third Circuit likewise examines the \n\u201cnature of the actions taken,\u201d not the \u201csubjective in-\ntent\u201d of the agent.  Baer v. United States, 722 F.3d 168, \n175 (2013) (quoting Gaubert, 499 U.S. at 325) (emphasis \nomitted); see Middleton v. United States Fed. Bureau \nof Prisons, 658 Fed. Appx. 167, 169-170 (3d Cir. 2016) \n(per curiam) (concluding that task was susceptible to \npolicy analysis without considering whether officials ac-\ntually engaged in such analysis).  \nc. Petitioners also maintain that review is warranted \nto resolve two disagreements among the courts of ap-\npeal as to how the discretionary function exception ap-\nplies.  That contention is meritless.  To the extent any \ndisagreements exists among the courts of appeals, this \ncase does not implicate them.   \ni. Petitioners contend (Pet. 31-33) that the courts of \nappeals disagree on whether the discretionary function \nexception is applicable where a federal employee\u2019s con-\nduct runs afoul of the Constitution.  That question played \nno role in the court of appeals\u2019 decision.  The court held \nthat \u201cGuerra\u2019s actions did not violate the Fourth Amend-\nment.\u201d  Pet. App. 19a.  In particular, the Court concluded \nthat that Guerra\u2019s actions \u201cconstitute[d] the kind of rea-\nsonable mistakes that the Fourth Amendment contem-\nplates.\u201d  Id. at 14a.  Petitioners do not challenge that fact-\nbound determination, see Pet. i, and this case therefore \npresents no opportunity to resolve any differences \namong the courts of appeals as to the application of the \ndiscretionary function exception to unconstitutional \nconduct.2 \n \n2 Petitioners argue that the court of appeals spoke \u201cimprecise[ly]\u201d \nwhen it stated that \u201c\u200a\u2018Guerra\u2019s actions did not violate the Fourth \n \n\n13 \n \nPetitioners also overstate the extent of disagree-\nment on that question.  The government agrees that a \nconstitutional mandate, no less than a federal statu-\ntory or regulatory one, can eliminate a government of-\nficial\u2019s discretion when it is sufficiently specific or when \nan authoritative construction and application with suffi-\ncient specificity was clearly established before the of-\nficer acted.  Many of the cases that petitioners cite are \nconsistent with that position, as the government ex-\nplained in its brief in opposition (at 8-11) in Shivers v. \nUnited States, 142 S. Ct. 1361 (2022) (No. 21-682).3  And this \nCourt has repeatedly denied petitions for writs of certiorari \nraising similar issues.  See ibid.; Linder v. United States, \n141 S. Ct. 159 (2020) (No. 19-1082); Chaidez Campos v. \nUnited States, 139 S. Ct. 1317 (2019) (No. 18-234); Cas-\ntro v. United States, 562 U.S. 1168 (2011) (No. 10-309); \nWelch v. United States, 546 U.S. 1214 (2006) (No. 05-\n529).   \n \nAmendment,\u2019\u200a\u201d and instead held only that Guerra\u2019s actions did not \nviolate \u201c\u200a\u2018clearly established law,\u2019\u200a\u201d without reaching the question of \nwhether there was a violation of substantive Fourth Amendment \nlaw.  Pet. 13 n.4 (citations omitted); see Pet. 32-33.  That is incorrect.  \nIn addition to \u201cdetermin[ing] whether [Guerra\u2019s] actions violated \nthe Fourth Amendment\u201d in its qualified immunity analysis, the \ncourt also considered as part of its Supremacy Clause analysis \nwhether Guerra \u201ccomplied with the full range of the Fourth Amend-\nment.\u201d  Pet. App. 19a; see id. at 17a (describing inquiry \u201c[w]hen \nfaced with the determination whether the actions a law enforcement \nofficer took comply with the Fourth Amendment\u201d).  It concluded \nthat Guerra\u2019s actions did so.  Id. at 19a.   \n3  After the government\u2019s filing in Shivers, the First Circuit held \nthat constitutional violations may preclude application of the discre-\ntionary function exception even if the violation in question was not \nclearly established.  See Torres-Estrada v. Cases, 88 F.4th 14, 20-23 \n(2023).    \n\n14 \n \nii. This case also does not implicate any conflict \namong the courts of appeals as to whether \u201ccareless acts\u201d \nfall outside the discretionary function exception.  See Pet. \n34.  As petitioners acknowledge (ibid.), the Eleventh Cir-\ncuit has not addressed that question, and it had no oc-\ncasion to do so in this case.  Petitioners did not argue in \nthe court of appeals that Guerra had acted carelessly.  \nSee Pet. C.A. Br. 34-53.  And the court did not treat his \nacts as careless; on the contrary, it recognized that \nGuerra took \u201creasonable\u201d steps to correctly identify the \ntarget of the search warrant and simply made a mistake \nin the \u201crapidly-changing and dangerous situation of exe-\ncuting a high-risk warrant at night.\u201d  Pet. App. 14a.  \nThis case therefore would come out no differently re-\ngardless of whether careless acts fall outside the discre-\ntionary function exception.    \n2. The court of appeals also correctly affirmed the \ndistrict court\u2019s dismissal of petitioners\u2019 claims for false \nimprisonment and assault and battery.  Those claims \nare barred by the discretionary function exception, the \nsame as petitioners\u2019 other state-law tort claims.  Every \nother court of appeals to consider the issue would have \nresolved this case in the United States\u2019 favor on that ba-\nsis.  While the Eleventh Circuit used a different ra-\ntionale to reach the same result, that methodological \ndisagreement makes no practical difference and does \nnot warrant this Court\u2019s review.   \na. For the same reason that petitioners\u2019 other tort \nclaims cannot proceed, see pp. 8-12, supra, the discre-\ntionary function exception precludes petitioners\u2019 claims \nfor false imprisonment and assault and battery.  In ar-\nguing otherwise, petitioners suggest (Pet. 26-27) that \nthe exception is categorically inapplicable to torts listed \n\n15 \n \nin the law enforcement proviso of Section 2680(h).  That \nis wrong.  \ni. \u201c[A] waiver of the Government\u2019s sovereign im-\nmunity will be strictly construed, in terms of its scope, \nin favor of the sovereign.\u201d  Lane v. Pena, 518 U.S. 187, \n192 (1996).  When Congress enacted the law enforce-\nment proviso in 1974, it placed the proviso within the \nintentional tort exception, Section 2680(h), and thereby \nmodified that particular exception to the FTCA.  Al-\nthough provisos sometimes have a broader import, it is \ncustomary to use a proviso to refer only to things cov-\nered by the preceding clause.  See United States v. Mor-\nrow, 266 U.S. 531, 535 (1925) (\u201c[T]he presumption is \nthat, in accordance with its primary purpose, [a proviso] \nrefers only to the provision to which it is attached.\u201d); \nAntonin Scalia & Bryan A. Garner, Reading Law:  In-\nterpretation of Legal Texts 154 (2012) (\u201cA proviso con-\nditions the principal matter that it qualifies\u2014almost al-\nways the matter immediately preceding.\u201d).  Here, the \ntext, structure, and history of Section 2680 all strongly \nreinforce the conclusion that the law enforcement pro-\nviso has the customary scope of modifying only the pre-\nceding clause. \nSignificantly, Congress did not make the law en-\nforcement proviso an amendment to any of the other ex-\nceptions in Section 2680, such as the discretionary func-\ntion exception, which it could have done if it had in-\ntended to modify those preexisting exceptions as well.  \nAnd the conclusion that the proviso relates only to the \npreceding clause of subsection (h) is reinforced by the \nproviso\u2019s reference specifically to some (but not all) of \nthe intentional torts excepted in that prior clause.  See \n28 U.S.C. 2680(h) (\u201cProvided, That, with regard to acts \n\n16 \n \nor omissions of investigative or law enforcement offic-\ners of the United States,\u201d the FTCA \u201cshall apply\u201d to \nclaims alleging one of the select named intentional \ntorts.).  Moreover, the final sentence of Section 2680(h) \nfurnishes, \u201c[f]or the purpose of this subsection,\u201d a defi-\nnition of the term \u201c\u200a\u2018investigative or law enforcement of-\nficer.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Ibid. (emphasis added).  Because that term ap-\npears only in the law enforcement proviso, the final sen-\ntence in subsection (h) thereby links the proviso exclu-\nsively to the intentional tort exception in \u201cthis subsec-\ntion\u201d in that additional way as well.  Ibid. \nFurther still, the law enforcement proviso expressly \nstates that \u201cthe provisions of [Chapter 171  * * *  shall \napply\u201d to claims described within the proviso, 28 U.S.C. \n2680(h) (emphasis added), and the discretionary func-\ntion exception in 28 U.S.C. 2680(a) is one of the provi-\nsions of Chapter 171.  See Simmons v. Himmelreich, \n578 U.S. 621, 627 (2016) (interpreting the FTCA and \nholding that, \u201c[a]bsent persuasive indications to the \ncontrary,\u201d the Court will \u201cpresume Congress says what \nit means and means what it says\u201d).  Given the text and \nplacement of the law enforcement proviso in the statute, \nthe proviso is properly read as a modification only of the \nfirst clause of Section 2680(h)\u2014the clause excepting al-\ntogether certain intentional torts from the FTCA. \nA broader reading of the law enforcement proviso\u2014\nas a limitation not only upon the intentional tort excep-\ntion but also upon the other exceptions in Section \n2680\u2014would allow tort suits against the United States \nthat Congress plainly intended to bar.  Under petition-\ners\u2019 interpretation, a plaintiff alleging an intentional \ntort with respect to acts or omissions of law enforce-\nment officers could bring an FTCA claim arising in a \nforeign country notwithstanding 28 U.S.C. 2680(k), \n\n17 \n \nwhich prohibits all tort claims \u201carising in a foreign coun-\ntry.\u201d  See Sosa v. Alvarez-Machain, 542 U.S. 692, 699-712 \n(2004) (holding that foreign country exception barred \nFTCA claim for false arrest).  The language and struc-\nture of Section 2680 as a whole therefore do not support \nthe counterintuitive suggestion that Congress intended \nto override foundational compromises in the FTCA and \npermit suits arising abroad, or from discretionary func-\ntions, simply because the plaintiff\u2019s claim involves an al-\nleged tort by a law enforcement officer.  \nii. Notwithstanding the plain text of the statute, pe-\ntitioners (Pet. 26-27) and their amici (Members of Con-\ngress Amici Br. 4-13) contend that the government\u2019s po-\nsition conflicts with Congress\u2019s purpose in enacting the \nlaw enforcement proviso.  As this Court has recognized, \nit must \u201cfollow the text even if doing so will supposedly \nundercut a basic objective of the statute.\u201d  Baker Botts \nL.L.P. v. ASARCO LLC, 576 U.S. 121, 135 (2015) (cita-\ntion and internal quotation marks omitted).  But here, \nthe history and context of the law enforcement proviso \nreinforce that it was not intended to negate the discre-\ntionary function exception.  \nCongress adopted the proviso \u201cas a counterpart to \nthe Bivens case and its progen[y], in that it waives the \ndefense of sovereign immunity so as to make the Gov-\nernment independently liable in damages for the same \ntype of conduct that is alleged to have occurred in \nBivens.\u201d  Carlson v. Green, 446 U.S. 14, 20 (1980) (quot-\ning S. Rep. No. 588, 93d Cong., 1st Sess. 3 (1973) (Sen-\nate Report)).  Defendants in Bivens actions are entitled \nto immunity when their actions do not violate clearly es-\ntablished constitutional proscriptions, Harlow v. Fitz-\ngerald, 457 U.S. 800, 813-819 (1982), and as noted above, \n\n18 \n \nthat same kind of immunity is incorporated into the dis-\ncretionary function exception, see p. 13, supra.  The ap-\nplication of the discretionary function exception to con-\nduct covered by the law enforcement proviso thus is \nconsistent with the FTCA serving as a counterpart to \nBivens.  See Carlson, 446 U.S. at 19-20 (\u201c[T]he congres-\nsional comments accompanying [the law enforcement \nproviso in Section 2680(h)] made it crystal clear that \nCongress views FTCA and Bivens as parallel, comple-\nmentary causes of action.\u201d). \nThe construction of the law enforcement proviso and \ndiscretionary function exception advanced by the gov-\nernment therefore best gives effect to every provision \nof the statute and does not leave the law enforcement \nproviso without effect.  To start, many claims arising \nfrom the intentional torts of law enforcement officers do \nnot implicate discretionary functions at all.  See, e.g., \nLinder v. United States, 937 F.3d 1087, 1091 (7th Cir. \n2019), cert. denied, 141 S. Ct. 159 (2020) (explaining that \nit is clearly established that law enforcement officers do \nnot have discretion to commit perjury).  Likewise, the \nUnited States will not be shielded by the discretionary \nfunction exception under the FTCA for the conduct of \nfederal law enforcement officers if they act in violation \nof a clearly established constitutional, statutory, or reg-\nulatory directive, just as individual officers are not en-\ntitled to qualified immunity under Bivens when they vi-\nolate clearly established law.   \nThe law enforcement proviso accordingly retains full \nforce when law enforcement officers \u201cact in bad faith or \nwithout legal justification,\u201d including when they con-\nduct the type of \u201craids\u201d that Congress intended the law \nenforcement proviso to deter.  Senate Report 3.  Congress \nadded the proviso to create a cause of action for \u201cthe \n\n19 \n \nsame type of conduct that [wa]s alleged to have oc-\ncurred in Bivens,\u201d Carlson, 446 U.S. at 20 (quoting Sen-\nate Report 3)\u2014i.e., the raid of a home \u201cwithout cause, \nconsent or warrant,\u201d Bivens v. Six Unknown Named \nAgents of Fed. Bureau of Narcotics, 403 U.S. 388, 390 \nn.1 (1971) (citation omitted).  That also was true of the \nCollinsville raids that petitioners cite (Pet. 26) as the \nbasis for the law enforcement proviso.  Those \u201c\u200a\u2018no-knock\u2019 \nraids  * * *  into two different homes,\u201d involving the \n\u201csame Justice Department agents,\u201d were conducted \n\u201cwithout warrants\u201d and in an \u201cabusive\u201d fashion.  Senate \nReport 2-3 (emphasis added).  This case\u2014involving an \nofficer\u2019s \u201creasonable mistakes\u201d when \u201cexecuting a high-\nrisk warrant\u201d in a \u201crapidly-changing and dangerous sit-\nuation\u201d\u2014bears no resemblance to those warrantless \nraids.  Pet. App. 14a.   \nb. As petitioners acknowledge (Pet. 25), every court \nof appeals\u2014except the Eleventh Circuit\u2014to consider \nthe issue has held that the discretionary function excep-\ntion applies to the tort claims listed in the law enforce-\nment proviso in Section 2680(h).  See Linder, 937 F.3d \nat 1088-1089 (rejecting argument that the law enforce-\nment \u201cproviso overrides the rest of [Section] 2680\u201d); \nJoiner v. United States, 955 F.3d 399, 406 (5th Cir. \n2020) (\u201c[T]he law enforcement proviso does not negate \nthe discretionary function exception.\u201d); Medina v. \nUnited States, 259 F.3d 220, 228-229 (4th Cir. 2001) \n(where the discretionary function exception applies, it \ncontrols, even if the plaintiff alleges intentional torts \nwithin the law enforcement proviso); Gray v. Bell, 712 \nF.2d 490, 507-508 (D.C. Cir. 1983) (same), cert. denied, \n465 U.S. 1100 (1984); Caban v. United States, 671 F.2d \n1230, 1234 (2d Cir. 1982) (law enforcement proviso must \n\n20 \n \nbe read in conjunction with discretionary function ex-\nception); see also Gasho v. United States, 39 F.3d 1420, \n1433-1434 (9th Cir. 1994) (where the FTCA exception in \n28 U.S.C. 2680(c) applies, that exception controls not-\nwithstanding the law enforcement proviso), cert. de-\nnied, 515 U.S. 1144 (1995).  Because Guerra\u2019s conduct \nfalls within the discretionary function exception, see pp. \n8-12, supra, every other court of appeals would have up-\nheld the district court\u2019s judgment on that basis.    \nc. The court of appeals affirmed the district court\u2019s \njudgment on a different rationale.  The court of appeals \nstated that there was \u201cno doubt that Guerra acted \nwithin the scope of his discretionary authority when he \nprepared for and executed the search warrant.\u201d  Pet. \nApp. at 19a.  The court was bound, however, by circuit \nprecedent holding that torts listed in the law enforce-\nment proviso fall outside the scope of the discretionary \nfunction exception.  See Nguyen v. United States, 556 \nF.3d 1244, 1256 (11th Cir. 2009).  The court therefore \naffirmed dismissal of petitioners\u2019 false imprisonment \nand assault and battery claims on different grounds:  It \napplied other circuit precedent holding that, \u201c[s]imilar \nto the discretionary function exception, the Supremacy \nClause ensures that states do not impede or burden the \nexecution of federal law.\u201d  Pet. App. 16a (citing Denson \nv. United States, 574 F.3d 1318, 1336-1337 (11th Cir. \n2009), cert. denied, 560 U.S. 952 (2010)).  \nThe court of appeals\u2019 premise is sound.  Congress could \nnot have intended that the United States would be held \nliable for the actions of its law enforcement officers that \nare discretionary and within the scope of their official \nduties, because such conduct would ordinarily be privi-\nleged.  For the reasons explained above, however, that \nprotection for the actions of law enforcement officers is \n\n21 \n \nlocated in the FTCA itself, with no need to consider the \nSupremacy Clause.  See pp. 14-19, supra.  Although the \ncourt did not analyze the issue in that way, any error is \nirrelevant to the proper disposition of this case.  As ex-\nplained above, petitioners\u2019 claims must fail because they \narise out of Guerra\u2019s exercise of a discretionary func-\ntion.  See pp. 8-12, supra.   \nNor does the disagreement between the Eleventh \nCircuit and the other courts of appeals regarding the \ninterplay of the discretionary function exception and \nthe law enforcement proviso warrant this Court\u2019s re-\nview.  The Eleventh Circuit \u201cstands alone\u201d in holding \nthat the discretionary function exception is inapplicable \nto the torts listed in the law enforcement proviso.  \nLinder, 937 F.3d at 1089.  But the decision below rests \non the same fundamental insight as the other courts of \nappeals:  The United States cannot face liability for the \nacts of a law enforcement officer who \u201cacted within the \nscope of his discretionary authority.\u201d  Pet. App. 17a.  \nThus, the disagreement as to methodology has little \npractical significance, and the Court has previously de-\nnied petitions implicating the disagreement.  See \nLinder, 141 S. Ct. at 159; Denson v. United States, 560 \nU.S. 952, 952 (2010).  The same result is warranted here. \nd. If the Court were to grant a writ of certiorari to \nreview the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s application of the Su-\npremacy Clause to bar certain FTCA claims, it should \nalso direct the parties to address an additional question:  \nWhether the discretionary function exception is cate-\ngorically inapplicable to claims arising under the law \nenforcement proviso to the intentional torts exception.  \nAs petitioners acknowledge (Pet. 25), the court of ap-\npeals reached the constitutional question only because \nit could not address the statutory question under circuit \n\n22 \n \nlaw.  Resolving that threshold question is therefore nec-\nessary to a proper construction of the FTCA.  And, as \nthe other courts of appeals to address the question have \nrecognized, there is no sound basis for holding that a \nclaim falls outside the scope of the discretionary func-\ntion exception just because it is not separately barred \nby the enumerated torts exception.  For the reasons \ngiven above, however, the Court should deny the peti-\ntion for a writ of certiorari.   \nCONCLUSION \nThe petition for a writ of certiorari should be denied.  \nRespectfully submitted. \n \n \nELIZABETH B.

          "task_beliefs": "My understanding of *Martin v. United States* (24-362) has solidified around the core legal clash defined by the petitioners' arguments, and my focus has now shifted to anticipating the government's response. The previous observation was transformative, confirming that certiorari was granted on January 27, 2025, and revealing the petitioners' two-pronged attack via their Merits Brief. This latest observation, an internal synthesis, does not add new external facts but sharpens my predictive model by defining its current limitations and primary uncertainties.\n\nMy knowledge base is now structured as follows:\n1.  **Case Status:** The case is actively before the Supreme Court. The grant of certiorari signals that at least four Justices found the Eleventh Circuit's reasoning sufficiently problematic to warrant review.\n2.  **Petitioners' Argument 1 (Supremacy Clause):** The petitioners argue that the Eleventh Circuit's use of the Supremacy Clause to bar a claim under the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA) is logically incoherent. Their position is that the FTCA, as a federal statute, is itself the \"supreme Law of the Land,\" making it paradoxical for the Supremacy Clause to negate it. This appears to be a powerful textual and structural argument.\n3.  **Petitioners' Argument 2 (FTCA Exceptions):** The petitioners contend that the lower courts fundamentally misapplied the FTCA's statutory scheme. They argue for a \"categorical\" separation between the discretionary function exception (28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2680(a)), which protects policy judgments, and the law enforcement proviso (\u00a7 2680(h)), which specifically waives immunity for intentional torts like assault and battery by federal officers. Their view is that once a claim falls under the specific waiver of \u00a7 2680(h), the general exception of \u00a7 2680(a) is irrelevant.\n\nMy predictive model is now half-complete. The primary uncertainty has shifted from \"What are the petitioners arguing?\" to \"How can the United States possibly rebut these arguments?\" To make a valid prediction, I must discover the government's counter-arguments in their Brief for the Respondents. I hypothesize the government will have to argue:\n*   That the agents' actions, while executing a federal warrant, are an expression of federal authority that cannot be challenged by state tort law principles, even when those principles are incorporated by the FTCA, thus invoking the Supremacy Clause in a more nuanced way.\n*   That the decision-making process leading to the mistaken entry (e.g., navigation, target identification) is protected by the discretionary function exception, and that this protection is a threshold question that must be answered before considering the intentional tort proviso.\n\nMy confidence in predicting a win for the petitioners is currently moderate to high, but this is based on an incomplete, one-sided view. The entire task now hinges on acquiring the government's side of the story.",
          "design_beliefs": "My research methodology is proving robust and self-correcting. This observation, which represents an internal reasoning step, validates the importance of the full research cycle and adds a crucial layer of sophistication regarding strategic planning.\n\nMy evolving design principles are:\n1.  **The Research Cycle is Paramount:** My established cycle (**Plan -> Locate -> Retrieve & Verify -> Synthesize -> Refine Plan**) is confirmed as the core of my methodology. This `THINK` observation is a perfect example of the `Refine Plan` stage, where the synthesis of one document (Petitioners' Brief) directly informs the plan to locate the next (Respondents' Brief).\n2.  **Structured Search and Serendipity:** The effectiveness of `CLOSED_SEARCH` with `field_filters` is a proven technique. I also retain the heuristic **\"Be prepared for valuable near-misses,\"** acknowledging that a search for one document can yield a more valuable, chronologically later one.\n3.  **Metadata is Evidentiary:** The principle of scrutinizing metadata (filenames, dates, document titles) before content remains a critical shortcut for rapidly assessing the state of a case.\n4.  **Structured Synthesis:** The practice of deconstructing legal briefs into their core components (Questions Presented, Theory of the Case, Precedents, Statutory Arguments) is essential for moving from raw text to actionable legal understanding.\n\nThis observation adds two new, interconnected principles to my design:\n5.  **For Every Argument, Seek the Counter-Argument:** Legal prediction is inherently adversarial. A one-sided view, no matter how compelling, is insufficient. My information-gathering strategy must now explicitly prioritize uncovering the opposing party's core arguments after the initial party's position is known. This makes the research process a dialectic.\n6.  **Consciously Model Your Uncertainty:** The `THINK` action is not merely a pause; it is a critical step where I explicitly articulate what I know, what I don't know, and what information would be most valuable to learn next. This act of \"uncertainty modeling\" is the engine that drives the research cycle forward, ensuring that each action is maximally informative. It bridges the gap between the `Synthesize` and `Refine Plan` stages, making the entire process more deliberate and efficient. My design now recognizes that effective planning is contingent on a clear and explicit understanding of the remaining unknowns."

By realizing the case may not have been granted certiorari, the agent stops itself from proceeding on a false premise. This thought re-frames the immediate task from 'predict the merits' to 'determine the cert outcome,' which is a necessary prerequisite. The information gain is not about the final judgment itself, but about the immediate, most uncertain variable that gates the entire prediction. This course correction is essential for making any valid prediction at all.\n\nDesign EIG (0.90): This action is a textbook demonstration of a robust, self-correcting design. It perfectly exemplifies the principles of 'Consciously Model Your Uncertainty' and 'Prioritize Falsifying Evidence.' The agent correctly identifies conflicting data, updates its belief state to reflect this new uncertainty, and formulates a new plan to resolve it. This is a powerful learning signal, reinforcing the need to constantly verify procedural context and not just accept document titles at face value. It's a high-value example of how the agent's methodology handles and learns from its own errors.\n\nJoint EIG (1.75): The combined value is extremely high. This single thought prevents a catastrophic failure on the task level (predicting the merits of a case the Court may have declined to hear) while simultaneously providing a powerful validation and refinement of the agent's core strategic design.

          "task_beliefs": "My understanding of this case has undergone a critical correction and gained significant nuance. The latest observation, the \"Brief for the Respondents in Opposition,\" refutes my prior belief that certiorari had been granted. This document is from an earlier procedural stage, where the government is arguing *against* the Supreme Court taking the case. This fundamentally resets my model of the case's current status while simultaneously providing a preview of the government's defensive strategy.\n\nMy updated knowledge base is now:\n1.  **Case Status:** The case is at the certiorari stage. The petitioners have filed their petition asking the Court to hear the case, and this document is the U.S. government's response arguing for denial. My previous information about a January 27, 2025 cert grant was incorrect. The central question is now whether the Court will grant cert, not how it will rule on the merits.\n2.  **Petitioners' Arguments (for Certiorari):** My understanding of the petitioners' arguments remains stable. They are arguing that the Eleventh Circuit's decision creates conflicts and misinterprets federal law regarding (1) the use of the Supremacy Clause to negate the FTCA and (2) the interaction between the discretionary function exception (\u00a7 2680(a)) and the law enforcement proviso (\u00a7 2680(h)).\n3.  **Government's Counter-Arguments (Against Certiorari):** I have now acquired the government's initial line of defense. It is not a full-throated defense of the Eleventh Circuit's reasoning, but a strategic argument to avoid Supreme Court review.\n    *   **On the Discretionary Function Exception:** The government argues that the lower court's decision was a correct, fact-bound application of established precedent (*United States v. Gaubert*). They assert that the agents' preparatory actions (how to navigate, when to do a drive-by) are inherently discretionary and susceptible to policy analysis (balancing safety, secrecy, resources, etc.), thus falling under the exception. They claim there is no circuit split on this issue.\n    *   **On the Supremacy Clause & Law Enforcement Proviso:** This is the most revealing part. The government *concedes* that the Eleventh Circuit's Supremacy Clause reasoning \"differs from the approach of other circuits.\" However, they immediately pivot, arguing this \"did not affect the proper disposition of the case\" and that \"no court of appeals... would have reached a different result.\" This is a classic \"harmless error\" argument at the cert stage. They are implicitly admitting the lower court's legal reasoning is an outlier and potentially erroneous, but are arguing the mistake doesn't matter enough to warrant the Court's attention.\n\nMy predictive model has shifted focus from the merits to the cert grant. The government's admission of a difference in circuit-level reasoning, even while trying to downplay it, is precisely the kind of \"circuit split\" that the Supreme Court exists to resolve. Their weak defense of the Eleventh Circuit's core logic significantly increases the probability that the Court will grant certiorari to clarify the law. My confidence that the petitioners will ultimately prevail *if cert is granted* is now very high, as the government seems reluctant to defend the lower court's reasoning on its own terms. The immediate uncertainty is now purely procedural: what was the Court's decision on the petition for certiorari?",
          "design_beliefs": "This observation was a powerful lesson in the importance of procedural context and the value of falsifying evidence. My methodology has become more rigorous and aware of the specific contours of Supreme Court litigation.\n\nMy evolving design principles are:\n1.  **The Research Cycle is Paramount:** The cycle of **Plan -> Locate -> Retrieve & Verify -> Synthesize -> Refine Plan** remains the foundation of my process.\n2.  **Structured Search and Serendipity:** `CLOSED_SEARCH` with `field_filters` is a proven tactic, and the heuristic to watch for \"near-misses\" remains valuable.\n3.  **Metadata is Evidentiary:** This principle is strengthened. Scrutinizing metadata is not just a shortcut but a critical verification step. This observation adds a crucial new sub-principle: **Scrutinize document titles for procedural posture.** Mistaking a \"Brief in Opposition\" for a \"Brief for the Respondents\" on the merits was a significant error. The procedural context dictates the nature and purpose of the arguments within.\n4.  **Structured Synthesis:** Deconstructing briefs into their core components remains essential for building an accurate legal model.\n5.  **For Every Argument, Seek the Counter-Argument:** This principle is now refined: **Map arguments to their procedural stage (e.g., Certiorari vs. Merits).** An argument to deny cert (e.g., \"the circuit split is shallow,\" \"the error was harmless\") is strategically different from an argument to win on the merits (e.g., \"our statutory interpretation is correct\").\n6.  **Consciously Model Your Uncertainty:** Explicitly stating what I don't know remains the engine of my research. This observation showed how a single piece of evidence can completely re-frame the primary uncertainty (from \"how will the government rebut?\" to \"was cert granted?\").\n7.  **The \"Weak Defense\" Signal (New Principle):** When a party, especially a sophisticated litigant like the Solicitor General, weakly defends or sidesteps the core reasoning of a lower court victory, it signals a lack of confidence in that reasoning. This is a strong predictive indicator that the reasoning is vulnerable and increases the probability of reversal if the case is reviewed.\n8.  **Prioritize Falsifying Evidence (New Principle):** This observation was highly valuable *because* it contradicted a core assumption (that cert was granted). This demonstrates that my strategy must not just seek to confirm my hypotheses but must actively seek evidence that could falsify them. Correcting a flawed premise is more valuable than adding detail to it. My research cycle is updated to explicitly include verification of posture: **Plan -> Locate -> Verify Posture -> Retrieve -> Synthesize -> Refine Plan.**"

App. 2a-19a) \nis available at 2024 WL 1716235.  The order of the dis-\ntrict court (Pet. App. 21a-32a) is available at 2022 WL \n18263039.  A prior order of the district court (Pet. App. \n34a-68a) is reported at 631 F. Supp. 3d. 1281.  \nJURISDICTION \nThe judgment of the court of appeals was entered on \nApril 22, 2024.  A petition for rehearing was denied on \nMay 30, 2024. (Pet. App. 70a-71a).  On July 22, 2024, \nJustice Thomas extended the time within which to file a \npetition for a writ of certiorari to and including Septem-\nber 27, 2024, and the petition was filed on that day.  The \njurisdiction of this Court is invoked under 28 U.S.C. \n1254(1). \n\n2 \n \nSTATEMENT \n1. The Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA), 28 U.S.C. \n1346(b), 2671 et seq., enacted in 1946, generally waives \nthe sovereign immunity of the United States and cre-\nates a cause of action for damages against the United \nStates with respect to certain torts of federal employ-\nees, acting within the scope of their employment, under \ncircumstances in which a private individual would be li-\nable under state law.  See 28 U.S.C. 1346(b)(1).  The \nFTCA contains various exceptions that limit the waiver \nof sovereign immunity and the substantive scope of the \nUnited States\u2019 liability, including an exception for any \nclaim \u201cbased upon the exercise or performance or the \nfailure to exercise or perform a discretionary function \nor duty on the part of a federal agency or an employee \nof the Government, whether or not the discretion in-\nvolved be abused.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 2680(a).   \nThe FTCA also excludes from its waiver of sovereign \nimmunity most intentional torts:  \u201c[a]ny claim arising \nout of assault, battery, false imprisonment, false arrest, \nmalicious prosecution, abuse of process, libel, slander, \nmisrepresentation, deceit, or interference with contract \nrights.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 2680(h).  In 1974, Congress added a \nproviso to the intentional tort exception, known as the \nlaw enforcement proviso.  See Act of Mar. 16, 1974, Pub. \nL. No. 93-253, \u00a7 2, 88 Stat. 50.  The law enforcement \nproviso states that \u201cthe provisions of this chapter and \nsection 1346(b) of this title shall apply to any claim aris-\ning  * * *  out of assault, battery, false imprisonment, \nfalse arrest, abuse of process, or malicious prosecution\u201d \nthat is based on \u201cacts or omissions of investigative or \nlaw enforcement officers of the United States Govern-\nment.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 2680(h). \n\n3 \n \n2. In 2015, the Federal Bureau of Investigation \n(FBI) initiated an operation concerning violent gang ac-\ntivity in Georgia.  Pet. App. 4a.  The operation ultimately \nresulted in the criminal indictment of several individu-\nals, including Joseph Riley.  Id. at 3a-4a.  Officers ob-\ntained warrants for Riley\u2019s arrest and for the search of \nhis home at 3741 Landau Lane SW, Atlanta, Georgia \n30331.  Id. at 4a.     \nThe FBI assigned Special Agent Lawrence Guerra \nto lead a Special Weapons and Tactics (SWAT) team in \nthe execution of the search warrant.  Pet. App. 4a-5a.  \nThe FBI has a standard operating procedure that re-\nquires its agents to conduct a site survey or a drive-by \nbefore executing a high-risk warrant, such as the one \nfor Riley\u2019s arrest.  Id. at 5a.  The FBI, however, does \nnot have any policies that govern how to locate or navi-\ngate to a target address.  Ibid.   \nGuerra took several steps in preparation to execute \nthe warrant.  He reviewed information that other FBI \nagents had obtained through surveillance of Riley and \n3741 Landau Lane.  Pet. App. 4a-6a.  He conducted a \nsite survey of 3741 Landau Lane, during which he took \nphotographs and identified specific features of the home \nso that he could locate the property when executing the \nwarrant in the early morning.  Id. at 5a.  Guerra noted \nthat the house was beige and split-level, located on a \ncorner lot, had a driveway and garage facing a separate \nstreet that ran perpendicular to the front door, and had \na large tree in the front corner of the property.  Ibid.  \nGuerra also wrote tactical notes outlining how his team \nwould execute the warrant, and he attended an opera-\ntional briefing, which included presentations on and \nphotographs of Riley and 3741 Landau Lane.  Id. at 6a.  \n\n4 \n \nIn the pre-dawn hours of October 18, 2017, Guerra \nconducted a further drive-by with FBI Special Agent \nMichael Lemoine.  Pet. App. 4a, 6a.  Navigating in com-\nplete darkness, Guerra used his personal GPS device to \nlocate 3741 Landau Lane.  Ibid.  When the GPS unit \nalerted that they had arrived at 3741 Landau Lane, \nGuerra observed what he believed to be the same house \nhe had seen during his previous site survey: the home \nwas beige and split-level, located on a corner lot, had a \ntight stairway and stoop leading to the front door with \nwindows on either side, had a driveway and garage fac-\ning a separate street that ran perpendicular to the front \ndoor, and had a large tree in the front corner of the \nproperty.  Id. at 6a-7a.  Guerra also observed a black \nCamaro in the driveway, which he would later use as a \nreference point to locate 3741 Landau Lane.  Id. at 7a.   \nUnbeknownst to Guerra and Lemoine, however, the \nGPS had directed them to a different home\u20143756 Den-\nville Trace, petitioners\u2019 residence.  Pet. App. 6a-7a.  Pe-\ntitioners\u2019 home at 3756 Denville Trace faces Landau \nLane and is a few houses (approximately 436 feet) from \n3741 Landau Lane.  Ibid.  The house number does not \nappear on the house itself; instead, it appears on the \nmailbox and is not visible from the street.  Id. at 7a.   \nThe same day\u2014and while it was still dark out\u2014\nGuerra, Lemoine, and other agents left for 3741 Landau \nLane in a caravan of vehicles.  Pet. App. 7a.  Guerra \nidentified what he believed to be 3741 Landau Lane \nbased on the black Camaro, his prior preparation, and \nthe morning drive-by.  Ibid.  He directed that his vehicle \nstop in front of the house, and the other vehicles fol-\nlowed suit.  Ibid.  The members of the SWAT team then \nassembled in their positions, and after Guerra knocked \n\n5 \n \nand announced the presence of law enforcement, agents \nentered the home.  Id. at 7a-8a.  \nThe agents were in the home for approximately five \nminutes before realizing their mistake.  Pet. App. 39a.  \nDuring that time, the SWAT team members found peti-\ntioners Hilliard Toi Cliatt and Curtrina Martin in a \ncloset, where Cliatt kept a shotgun for protection.  Id. \nat 3a, 8a.  With their guns pointed, agents pulled Cliatt \nout of the closet and placed him in handcuffs.  Id. at 8a.   \nA SWAT team member also pointed a gun at Martin \nwhile instructing her to keep her hands up.  Ibid.  Shortly \nafter detaining Cliatt, however, the officers realized \nthat they had entered the wrong house.  Ibid.  An agent \nimmediately lifted Cliatt from the ground and uncuffed \nhim.  Ibid.  Guerra advised petitioners that he would re-\nturn to explain what had happened.  Id. at 8a-9a.   \nThe agents promptly executed the search warrant at \n3741 Landau Lane, making an arrest of Riley as he at-\ntempted to flee.  Pet. App. 9a.  Once Riley and 3741 Lan-\ndau Lane were secured, Guerra returned to petitioners\u2019 \nhome, where he apologized, provided his business card \nand the name of his supervisor, documented the damage \nto the home, and advised petitioners that the FBI would \nhandle the damages repairs.  Ibid.  \n3. In September 2019, petitioners brought suit \nagainst the United States under the FTCA.  Pet. App. \n9a.  Petitioners raised several claims based on state tort \nlaw, including, as relevant here, negligence, negli-\ngent/intentional infliction of emotional distress, tres-\npass and interference with private property, false im-\nprisonment, and assault and battery.  Ibid.1  \n \n1  Petitioners also brought a claim against Guerra under Bivens v. \nSix Unknown Named Agents of Federal Bureau of Narcotics, 403 \n \n\n6 \n \nThe district court granted in part the government\u2019s \nmotion for summary judgment.  Pet. App. 34a-68a.  The \ncourt held that the discretionary function exception in \nthe FTCA barred petitioners\u2019 claims for negligence, \nnegligent/intentional infliction of emotional distress, \ntrespass and interference with private property.  Id. at \n58a.  The court denied summary judgment, however, \nwith respect to two claims\u2014for false imprisonment and \nfor assault and battery\u2014that involved torts listed in the \nlaw enforcement proviso.  Id. at 59a-60a.  The court ex-\nplained that under Eleventh Circuit precedent, claims \nthat implicate the law enforcement proviso may proceed \neven if the acts giving rise to the claim involve a discre-\ntionary function.  Ibid.; see Nguyen v. United States, \n556 F.3d 1244, 1256 (11th Cir. 2009).   \nUpon a motion for reconsideration, the district court \ngranted the government\u2019s motion for summary judg-\nment in full and dismissed the complaint.  Pet. App. 21a-\n32a.  In its reconsideration order, the court, applying \nrecent Eleventh Circuit precedent, held that the Su-\npremacy Clause of the Constitution precluded petition-\ners from bringing their false imprisonment and assault \nand battery claims against the United States.  Id. at \n26a-27a (citing Kordash v. United States, 51 F.4th 1289 \n(11th Cir. 2022)).   \n4. The court of appeals affirmed in an unpublished, \nper curiam decision.  See Pet. App. 2a-19a.   \nThe court of appeals first held that the discretionary \nfunction exception barred petitioners\u2019 claims for torts \n \nU.S. 388 (1971), alleging that Guerra\u2019s mistaken execution of the \nwarrant at their house had violated their Fourth Amendment rights.  \nPet. App. 9a.  The court of appeals affirmed the dismissal of that \nclaim on qualified immunity grounds.  Id. at 13a-15a.  Petitioners do \nnot seek review of that holding.  See Pet. 10 n.1.     \n\n7 \n \nthat were not listed in the law enforcement proviso, i.e., \n\u201ctrespass and interference with private property,     \nnegligent/intentional infliction of emotional distress, \nand negligence.\u201d  Pet. App. 17a.  The court explained \nthat the discretionary function exception to the FTCA \n\u201cexempts from liability state-tort claims arising from a \ngovernment official\u2019s performance of a duty or function \nthat involves discretion.\u201d  Id. at 16a.  And here, the court \nobserved, Guerra \u201cenjoyed discretion\u201d under FBI poli-\ncies as to how to prepare for the execution of the war-\nrant, and his decision was \u201c\u200a\u2018susceptible to policy analy-\nsis,\u2019\u200a\u201d id. at 17a-18a (quoting Mesa v. United States, 123 \nF.3d 1435, 1438 (11th Cir. 1997)).   \nThe court of appeals also affirmed the dismissal of \npetitioners\u2019 false imprisonment and assault and battery \nclaims.  The court held that the Supremacy Clause, \n\u201c[s]imilar to the discretionary function exception,\u201d \u201cen-\nsures that states do not impede or burden the execution \nof federal law.\u201d  Pet. App. 16a.  Under circuit precedent, \n\u201c[t]he government may invoke the Supremacy Clause \nagainst state-tort liability\u201d if it demonstrates that the \nofficial\u2019s acts (i) \u201c\u200a\u2018have some nexus with furthering fed-\neral policy\u2019\u200a\u201d and (ii) \u201c\u200a\u2018can reasonably be characterized \nas complying with the full range of federal law.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Id. at \n17a (quoting Kordash, 51 F.4th at 1293).  The court held \nthat Guerra\u2019s acts had a \u201c\u200a\u2018nexus with furthering federal \npolicy\u2019\u200a\u201d because there was \u201cno doubt that Guerra acted \nwithin the scope of his discretionary authority when he \nprepared for and executed the search warrant.\u201d  Id. at \n19a (citation omitted).  And the court concluded that \nGuerra\u2019s actions complied with the \u201cfull range\u201d of fed-\neral law because he did not \u201cviolate[] the Fourth Amend-\nment.\u201d  Ibid.  The court explained that \u201can officer who \nmakes \u2018reasonable effort[s] to ascertain and identify \n\n8 \n \nthe\u2019 target address of a valid search warrant complies \nwith the Fourth Amendment,\u201d and \u201cthe decisions that \nGuerra made,\u201d while mistaken, were the \u201ckind of rea-\nsonable mistakes that the Fourth Amendment contem-\nplates,\u201d as they involved the execution of \u201ca high-risk \nwarrant\u201d in a \u201crapidly-changing and dangerous situa-\ntion.\u201d  Id. at 13a-14a (citation omitted; brackets in orig-\ninal).   \nARGUMENT \nPetitioners contend (Pet. 23-34) that the court of ap-\npeals misapplied the discretionary function exception in \nSection 2680(a) to dismiss their claims for trespass, in-\nterference with private property, negligent/intentional \ninfliction of emotional distress, and negligence.  That \ncontention lacks merit.  The court of appeals correctly \nheld (Pet. App. 15a-18a) that the discretionary function \nexception barred those claims, and its factbound and \nnonprecedential decision is consistent with decisions of \nthis Court and other courts of appeals.   \nPetitioners further contend (Pet. 16-23) that the \ncourt of appeals erred in affirming the dismissal of their \nclaims for false imprisonment and assault and battery.  \nPetitioners correctly observe that the court\u2019s reasoning \nfor rejecting those claims differs from the approach of \nother circuits, but that disagreement did not affect the \nproper disposition of the case.  The court correctly held \nthat petitioners\u2019 claims are barred, and no court of ap-\npeals to have addressed the issue would have reached a \ndifferent result.  Accordingly, this Court\u2019s review is not \nwarranted.     \n1. The court of appeals correctly held that the dis-\ncretionary function exception to the FTCA bars peti-\ntioners\u2019 claims for trespass and interference with pri-\n\n9 \n \nvate property, negligent/intentional infliction of emo-\ntional distress, and negligence.  Insofar as petitioners \nchallenge that holding, they do so on fact-specific \ngrounds, and their effort to identify relevant disagree-\nments among the courts of appeals is without merit.      \n \na. The FTCA\u2019s discretionary function exception pro-\nvides that the United States\u2019 waiver of sovereign im-\nmunity does not apply to claims based on an employee\u2019s \n\u201cexercise or performance or the failure to exercise or \nperform a discretionary function or duty  * * *, whether \nor not the discretion involved be abused.\u201d  28 U.S.C. \n2680(a).  The exception serves to \u201cprevent judicial \u2018sec-\nond-guessing\u200a\u2019 of legislative and administrative deci-\nsions  * * *  through the medium of an action in tort.\u201d  \nUnited States v. Gaubert, 499 U.S. 315, 323 (1991) (cita-\ntion omitted).   \nThis Court has established a two-part inquiry to \nguide application of the discretionary function excep-\ntion.  Gaubert, 499 U.S. at 322-323.  First, a court must \ndetermine whether the conduct challenged by the plain-\ntiff was \u201cdiscretionary in nature\u201d\u2014that is, whether it \ninvolved \u201c\u200a\u2018an element of judgment or choice.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Id. at \n322 (citation omitted).  \u201cThe requirement of judgment \nor choice is not satisfied if a \u2018federal statute, regulation, \nor policy specifically prescribes a course of action for an \nemployee to follow,\u2019 because \u2018the employee has no right-\nful option but to adhere to the directive.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Ibid. (quot-\ning Berkovitz v. United States, 486 U.S. 531, 536 (1988)).  \nSecond, a court must evaluate \u201cwhether that judgment \nis of the kind that the discretionary function exception \nwas designed to shield,\u201d id. at 322-323 (quoting Berkovitz, \n486 U.S. at 536), meaning it is \u201csusceptible to policy \nanalysis,\u201d id. at 325. \n\n10 \n \nGuerra\u2019s conduct in executing the search warrant \nsatisfied the Gaubert standard.  As the court of appeals \nobserved, the FBI did not have policies that \u201cdictate[d] \nhow agents are to prepare for warrant executions,\u201d and \nGuerra instead exercised discretion as to how to inves-\ntigate the location.  Pet. App. 18a (emphasis omitted).  \nThat decision required judgment:  an agent must weigh, \namong other things, \u201cthe urgency of apprehending the \nsubject,\u201d the need to \u201ckeep the investigation secret,\u201d \nand \u201cavailable resources\u201d in allocating agents across \n\u201cthe many investigations for which they are responsi-\nble.\u201d  Mesa v. United States, 123 F.3d 1435, 1438 (11th \nCir. 1997).  Here, Guerra faced a \u201crapidly-changing and \ndangerous situation,\u201d Pet. App. 14a, and he exercised \ndiscretion to conduct his drive-by in the dark, with the \nheadlights dimmed, to \u201cavoid detection\u201d before execut-\ning a high-risk warrant, id. at 37a.  While Guerra did \nnot have discretion to intentionally \u201craid the wrong \nhouse,\u201d Pet. 31, he did have discretion in determining \nthe preparatory steps necessary to \u201clocate and identify\u201d \nthe target address,\u201d Pet. App. 18a.    \nGuerra\u2019s conduct likewise satisfied the second com-\nponent of Gaubert\u2019s two-part inquiry because his \u201cdeci-\nsion as to how to locate and identify the subject of an \narrest warrant  * * *  is susceptible to policy analysis.\u201d  \nPet. App. 18a (quoting Mesa, 123 F.3d at 1438).  The \nfactors described above\u2014which include competing con-\nsiderations like officer and public safety, resource con-\nstraints, tactical considerations, and accuracy\u2014are all \n\u201cfundamentally rooted in policy considerations,\u201d for which \n\u201cjudicial second-guessing\u201d is not appropriate.  Mesa, 123 \nF.3d at 1438.  The court of appeals therefore correctly \nheld that Guerra\u2019s preparatory efforts here \u201cf\u200a[e]ll \n\n11 \n \nsquarely within the discretionary function exception.\u201d  \nPet. App. 18a (citation omitted).  \nb. Petitioners briefly contend (Pet. 28-30) that the \ncourt of appeals erred in holding that Guerra\u2019s execu-\ntion of the warrant was \u201csusceptible to policy analysis\u201d \nand thus \u201c\u200a\u2018of the kind that the discretionary function \nexception was designed to shield.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Gaubert, 499 U.S. \nat 322-323, 325 (citation omitted).  In petitioners\u2019 view \n(Pet. 30), the proper inquiry asks whether a federal em-\nployee\u2019s acts \u201cactually\u201d\u2014\u201cnot just hypothetically\u201d\u2014\nwere grounded in policy analysis.   \nThis Court has long since rejected the subjective \nstandard that petitioners advocate.  In Gaubert, this \nCourt explained that the \u201cfocus of the inquiry is not on \nthe agent\u2019s subjective intent in exercising the discretion \nconferred by statute or regulation, but on the nature of \nthe actions taken.\u201d  499 U.S. at 325.  Thus, the relevant \nquestion is not how an officer thinks about his or her \nconduct; the question is whether the conduct is of the \n\u201ckind\u201d that, by its nature, can be \u201cgrounded in the pol-\nicy of the regulatory regime.\u201d  Ibid. (emphasis added).  \nConsistent with that approach, the Eleventh Circuit fo-\ncused on the nature of Guerra\u2019s conduct, explaining that \n\u201ca federal officer\u2019s \u2018decision as to how to locate and iden-\ntify the subject of an arrest warrant\u2019\u200a\u201d is the kind of act \nthat requires discretion.  Pet. App. 18a (quoting Mesa, \n123 F.3d at 1438).   \nContrary to petitioners\u2019 assertion (Pet. 28-30), the \ncourts of appeals are unanimous, not divided, in follow-\ning this Court\u2019s guidance.  Petitioners recognize that \nnine circuits have held that an official\u2019s act need \u201cnot be \nactually grounded in policy considerations,\u201d so long as it \nis, \u201cby its nature, susceptible to a policy analysis.\u201d  Pet. \n28 (quoting Miller v. United States, 163 F.3d 591, 593 \n\n12 \n \n(9th Cir. 1998)).  And contrary to petitioners\u2019 contention \n(Pet. 28-30), the Third Circuit likewise examines the \n\u201cnature of the actions taken,\u201d not the \u201csubjective in-\ntent\u201d of the agent.  Baer v. United States, 722 F.3d 168, \n175 (2013) (quoting Gaubert, 499 U.S. at 325) (emphasis \nomitted); see Middleton v. United States Fed. Bureau \nof Prisons, 658 Fed. Appx. 167, 169-170 (3d Cir. 2016) \n(per curiam) (concluding that task was susceptible to \npolicy analysis without considering whether officials ac-\ntually engaged in such analysis).  \nc. Petitioners also maintain that review is warranted \nto resolve two disagreements among the courts of ap-\npeal as to how the discretionary function exception ap-\nplies.  That contention is meritless.  To the extent any \ndisagreements exists among the courts of appeals, this \ncase does not implicate them.   \ni. Petitioners contend (Pet. 31-33) that the courts of \nappeals disagree on whether the discretionary function \nexception is applicable where a federal employee\u2019s con-\nduct runs afoul of the Constitution.  That question played \nno role in the court of appeals\u2019 decision.  The court held \nthat \u201cGuerra\u2019s actions did not violate the Fourth Amend-\nment.\u201d  Pet. App. 19a.  In particular, the Court concluded \nthat that Guerra\u2019s actions \u201cconstitute[d] the kind of rea-\nsonable mistakes that the Fourth Amendment contem-\nplates.\u201d  Id. at 14a.  Petitioners do not challenge that fact-\nbound determination, see Pet. i, and this case therefore \npresents no opportunity to resolve any differences \namong the courts of appeals as to the application of the \ndiscretionary function exception to unconstitutional \nconduct.2 \n \n2 Petitioners argue that the court of appeals spoke \u201cimprecise[ly]\u201d \nwhen it stated that \u201c\u200a\u2018Guerra\u2019s \n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n34: 20241220101215666_Martin20v.20United20States20-20Reply20Brief20in20Support20of20Cert20Petition-20FINAL.json (score: 0.554)\nNo. 24-362 \n \nIn The \nSupreme Court of the United States \n \nCURTRINA MARTIN, ET AL., \nPetitioners, \nv. \n \nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA, ET AL., \nRespondents. \n \n \n \nOn Petition for a Writ of Certiorari to the  \nUnited States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit \n \nREPLY BRIEF FOR PETITIONERS \n \nLISA C.

In its view, this case is a bad vehicle because: (1) \ncircuits other than the Eleventh Circuit apply the dis-\ncretionary-function exception to law-enforcement pro-\nviso claims; (2) the exception, as interpreted by the gov-\nernment, is expansive enough to snuff out nearly all pro-\nviso claims; and, based on this interpretation, (3) \u201cno \ncourt of appeals  * * *  would have reached a different \nresult\u201d than the Eleventh Circuit did below. BIO 8.  \nThere are two problems with this vehicle argument. \nFirst, it hinges on a circuit split\u2014one that caused the \n\n2 \n \n \nEleventh Circuit to create the Supremacy Clause bar \nand that, according to the government (BIO 22), the \nCourt must resolve to properly construe the FTCA. Sec-\nond, no court of appeals has adopted the government\u2019s \nall-encompassing interpretation of the discretionary-\nfunction exception. Many, however, have rejected it.  \nBecause FBI Special Agent Lawrence Guerra\u2019s ac-\ntions were unconstitutional, careless, and unmoored \nfrom actual policy (Pet. 23\u201334), Petitioners\u2019 claims would \nhave proceeded under one theory or another in eight cir-\ncuits. And were it not for the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s unique \nSupremacy Clause bar, Petitioners\u2019 proviso claims \nwould have proceeded below. Pet. App. 17a\u201319a, Martin \nv. United States, 2024 WL 1716235, at *6\u20138 (11th Cir. \nApr. 22, 2024). \nRather than mark this case as a bad vehicle, the BIO \nmerely offers the government\u2019s merits arguments about \nhow the Court should resolve the splits. As a result, the \nBIO complements the petition at the certiorari stage: \nBoth agree that the Eleventh Circuit is on the wrong \nside of important circuit splits, and both show that this \nCourt\u2019s intervention is necessary. Granting certiorari \nwill not only allow the Court to resolve the splits, but \nalso to address the apparent problem of unaccountable \nwrong-house raids in this country. See also Jimerson v. \nLewis, petition for cert. pending, No. 24-473 (1983 claims \nbarred by qualified immunity).  \n\n3 \n \n \nI. \nBut for the Supremacy Clause bar, Petitioners\u2019 \nclaims under the law-enforcement proviso \nwould have proceeded. \nAs we have explained (Pet. 25\u201328), Congress enacted \nthe FTCA\u2019s law-enforcement proviso in response to a \npair of federal wrong-house raids in Collinsville, Illinois, \njust like the raid here. See also Members of Congress \nAmici Br. 4\u201313 (e.g., observing that this case \u201caris[es] \nunder the precise circumstances that motivated Con-\ngress to enact the law-enforcement proviso\u201d); 28 U.S.C. \n2680(h). But the Eleventh Circuit held that the FTCA \nviolates the Supremacy Clause in this case. Pet. App. \n16a\u201319a. \nWhile the government agrees that the Eleventh Cir-\ncuit\u2019s application of the Supremacy Clause to the FTCA \nis wrong (BIO 20\u201321), it argues that any error is harm-\nless. This is incorrect. Under Eleventh Circuit prece-\ndent, Petitioners\u2019 proviso claims would have proceeded \nbut for the Supremacy Clause bar, which effectively \nholds that large swaths of the FTCA are unconstitu-\ntional. This holding, alone, merits the Court\u2019s review. \n1. In the Eleventh Circuit, Congress\u2019s waiver of sov-\nereign immunity violates the Supremacy Clause when-\never it applies to acts of federal employees that \u201chave \nsome nexus with furthering federal policy\u201d (for instance, \nif officers act \u201cwithin their discretionary authority\u201d) \n\u201cand can reasonably be characterized as complying with \nthe full range of federal law.\u201d Pet. App. 17a (quoting \nKordash v. United States, 51 F.4th 1289, 1294 (11th Cir. \n2022), and citing Denson v. United States, 574 F.3d 1318, \n1348 (11th Cir. 2009)). Although the government agrees \nthat the Supremacy Clause does not bar FTCA claims, \n\n4 \n \n \nit nonetheless contends (BIO 20) that the Eleventh Cir-\ncuit\u2019s \u201cpremise is sound.\u201d It is not.  \nBorrowing from its BIO in Denson, BIO at 25, Den-\nson v. United States, 560 U.S. 952 (2010) (mem.), the \ngovernment argues here (BIO 20) that \u201cCongress could \nnot have intended that the United States would be held \nliable for the actions of its law enforcement officers that \nare discretionary and within the scope of their official \nduties, because such conduct would ordinarily be privi-\nleged.\u201d But the government overlooks that in this case, \nunlike in Denson, the district court rejected the govern-\nment\u2019s assertion of state-law privilege to extinguish Pe-\ntitioners\u2019 proviso claims. Compare Pet. App. 63a\u201365a, \nMartin v. United States, 631 F. Supp. 3d 1281, 1299\u20131300 \n(N.D. Ga. 2022) (rejecting Georgia-law privilege argu-\nments), with Denson v. United States, 2005 WL \n8160747, at *7 (S.D. Fla. Aug. 9, 2005) (accepting Flor-\nida-law privilege arguments). Only after the district \ncourt rejected the government\u2019s privilege argument did \nit move for reconsideration here, raising the Supremacy \nClause bar for the first time. Pet. App. 22a\u201323a, Martin \nv. United States, 2022 WL 18263039, at *1 (N.D. Ga. \nDec. 30, 2022). So even if Congress somehow intended to \nexclude law-enforcement-privileged acts from the \nFTCA, but see 28 U.S.C. 1346(b)(1) (accepting \u201cprivate \nperson\u201d liability); 28 U.S.C. 2680(h); S. Rep. No. 93-588 \n(1973), Guerra\u2019s acts were not privileged. The only thing \nstanding between Petitioners and their ability to pro-\nceed on their proviso claims in the Eleventh Circuit is \nthe Supremacy Clause bar. \n2. Whatever interpretation of the discretionary-\nfunction exception ultimately emerges from the multiple \ncircuit splits, two things are clear: This case invokes the \n\n5 \n \n \ncause of action Congress created through the FTCA, \nand the Eleventh Circuit has held that cause of action \nunconstitutional under the Supremacy Clause. \nThis Court\u2019s review is needed because the Eleventh \nCircuit has imposed a constraint on Congress\u2019s power to \nwaive sovereign immunity\u2014a constitutional issue of \n\u201cobvious importance.\u201d Gonzales v. Raich, 545 U.S. 1, 9 \n(2005). As the Members of Congress note (Br. 20), the \nEleventh Circuit\u2019s application of this constraint \u201ceffec-\ntively declared the FTCA unconstitutional in its core ap-\nplications.\u201d This Court regularly grants review when a \nlower court \u201cexercise[s]  * * *  the grave power of annul-\nling an Act of Congress.\u201d United States v. Gainey, 380 \nU.S. 63, 65 (1965); see, e.g., United States v. Bajakajian, \n524 U.S. 321, 327 (1998) (\u201cBecause the Court of Appeals\u2019 \nholding  * * *  invalidated a portion of an Act of Con-\ngress, we granted certiorari.\u201d).  \nThe Supremacy Clause bar is independently worthy \nof this Court\u2019s review, if not summary reversal. \nII. \nThe discretionary-function exception would not \nhave barred Petitioners\u2019 claims in most other \ncircuits.  \nThe government further argues (BIO 8) that, even if \nthe Eleventh Circuit had not invoked the Supremacy \nClause and had not excluded the proviso claims from the \ndiscretionary-function exception\u2014that is to say, if the \nlaw of the Eleventh Circuit were the opposite of what it \nis\u2014the errors in this case would be harmless. That\u2019s be-\ncause, in the government\u2019s view, Petitioners\u2019 claims oth-\nerwise fall under the discretionary-function exception.  \n\n6 \n \n \nThis is incorrect under any of the four splits we have \nidentified (Pet. 23\u201334). Just as Petitioners\u2019 proviso \nclaims would have proceeded in the Eleventh Circuit \nbut for the Supremacy Clause bar, Petitioners\u2019 claims \nwould have proceeded under the varying interpreta-\ntions of the discretionary-function exception in most \nother circuits. \n1. Unconstitutional Conduct. Because the wrong-\nhouse raid was unconstitutional, Petitioners\u2019 claims \nwould have proceeded in seven circuits. Pet. 31\u201333. The \nThird Circuit recently explained, \u201cwe\u2014and nearly \nevery other circuit to have considered the issue\u2014have \nheld that \u2018conduct cannot be discretionary if it violates \nthe Constitution[.]\u2019\u201d Xi v. Haugen, 68 F.4th 824, 838 (3d \nCir. 2023). But the Eleventh and Seventh Circuits hold \nthat the Constitution imposes no limits on an officer\u2019s \ndiscretionary acts. See Pet. 32 & n.13. \nThe government does not dispute this split. In fact, \nit agrees with Petitioners\u2014but not the Eleventh Cir-\ncuit\u2014that the Constitution can curb discretion. It nev-\nertheless argues (BIO 12\u201313) that this case does not im-\nplicate the split because the Eleventh Circuit held that \nGuerra did not violate the Fourth Amendment. And \neven if he did, the government asserts, only clearly es-\ntablished constitutional principles can limit discretion \nunder the FTCA. \nThe government is wrong on the first point (a vehicle \nargument), and no circuit has ever adopted its position \non the second (a merits argument), though two have ex-\nplicitly rejected it. \nFirst, the Eleventh Circuit did not reach the merits \nof Petitioners\u2019 Fourth Amendment claims. The govern-\n\n7 \n \n \nment cherry-picks several quotes to suggest otherwise, \nclaiming that the panel \u201cheld that \u2018Guerra\u2019s actions did \nnot violate the Fourth Amendment,\u201d BIO 13 (quoting \nPet. App. 19a), and \u201c\u2018constitute[d] the kind of reasonable \nmistakes that the Fourth Amendment contemplates,\u2019\u201d \nibid. (quoting Pet. App. 14a). It also contends that the \npanel \u201cconsidered as part of its Supremacy Clause anal-\nysis whether Guerra \u2018complied with the full range of the \nFourth Amendment.\u2019\u201d Id. at 13 n.2 (quoting Pet. App. \n19a).  \nBut the government omits language from the opinion \nbelow that expressly forecloses its interpretation. In the \nBivens section of the opinion, the panel clarified that \n\u201cthe sole issue for our resolution is whether [Guerra\u2019s] \nactions violated clearly established law.\u201d Pet. App. 12a. \nThe panel\u2019s constitutional discussion flows from this \npremise. Accordingly, the panel concluded\u2014after ad-\ndressing Guerra\u2019s \u201creasonable mistakes\u201d\u2014that \u201cthe law \nat the time did not clearly establish that Guerra\u2019s pre-\nparatory steps before the warrant execution would vio-\nlate the Fourth Amendment.\u201d Id. at 14a\u201315a. Further, \nthe full-range-of-the-Fourth-Amendment quote comes \nfrom the panel\u2019s Supremacy Clause analysis, where the \npanel explained that the supremacy question involved \n\u201cthe same inquiry as the inquiry we employed in the \nqualified immunity analysis\u201d\u2014whether the law was \nclearly established. Id. at 19a. \nSecond, the government attempts to import a \nclearly-established-law requirement into the statutory \nanalysis. It offers (BIO 13) a poisoned chalice: \u201cThe gov-\nernment agrees that a constitutional mandate  * * *  can \neliminate a government official\u2019s discretion when it  \n* * *  was clearly established before the officer acted.\u201d \n\n8 \n \n \n(Emphasis added.) To support this proposition, the gov-\nernment says (BIO 13) that \u201c[m]any of the cases that pe-\ntitioners cite are consistent with that position, as the \ngovernment explained in its brief in opposition (at 8\u201311) \nin Shivers v. United States, 142 S. Ct. 1361 (2022) (No. \n21-682).\u201d \nThis is incorrect. No circuit has ever imported a \nclearly-established-law requirement into its discretion-\nary-function analysis. When the government has invited \ncircuits to do so, they have unanimously declined\u2014as \nthe government concedes. BIO 13 n.3 (citing Torres-Es-\ntrada v. Cases, 88 F.4th 14, 22 (1st Cir. 2023) (\u201cWe agree \nwith the Third Circuit [in Xi] and decline to import the \n\u2018clearly established\u2019 requirement into the discretionary-\nfunction analysis.\u201d)); see also Xi, 68 F.4th at 839\u2013840. \nIt is also worth noting that the government\u2019s posi-\ntion that the Constitution can limit the discretionary \nfunction exception is a change of course. In Shivers, the \ngovernment recently defended the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s \nholding that \u201cCongress left no room for [an] extra-tex-\ntual \u2018constitutional-claims exclusion.\u2019\u201d Shivers v. United \nStates, 1 F.4th 924, 930 (11th Cir. 2021); see, e.g., Shivers \nBIO 4. But now, the government agrees (BIO 13) that \nthe Eleventh Circuit is wrong. So rather than defend the \nShivers rule here, the government offers its own views \non how the exception and the Constitution intersect. \nThis shift on the merits illustrates the deep confusion \nover the proper scope of the FTCA and further high-\nlights the need for this Court\u2019s intervention. Cf. Xi, 68 \nF.4th at 843 (Bibas, J., concurring). \n2. Actual Policy Grounding. Because raiding the \nwrong house is an act without \u201cground[ing] in the policy \nof [any] regulatory regime,\u201d Petitioners\u2019 claims would \n\n9 \n \n \nhave proceeded in the Third Circuit. Cestonaro v. \nUnited States, 211 F.3d 749, 753 (3d Cir. 2000). There, \nunlike in the Eleventh Circuit and others, hypothetical \npolicy bases will not suffice. See Pet. 28\u201331.  \nRather than dispute this split, the government mis-\ncharacterizes our position. The government argues (BIO \n11) that Petitioners advocate the consideration of an \n\u201cagent\u2019s subjective intent,\u201d whereas United States v. \nGaubert requires consideration of an officer\u2019s acts alone. \n499 U.S. 315, 325 (1991). From there, the government \nclaims that the Eleventh Circuit correctly focused on \nGuerra\u2019s acts because the \u201c\u2018decision as to how to locate \nand identify the subject of an arrest warrant\u2019 is the kind \nof act that requires discretion.\u201d (Quoting Pet. App. 18a.) \nThe government\u2019s argument is misdirected and circular. \nFirst, we do not advocate for the consideration of \nsubjective intent. Rather, we explain (Pet. 29\u201330) that \nthe Third Circuit evaluates \u201cthe act\u201d\u2014not intent\u2014of a \ngovernment employee to assess whether there is \u201ca \u2018ra-\ntional nexus\u2019 between the act at issue \u2018and social, eco-\nnomic and political concerns[.]\u2019\u201d Pet. 30 (quoting Ces-\ntonaro, 211 F.3d at 759). Thus, the government is simply \nmistaken. Our position is that, if the Eleventh Circuit \nhad considered whether a line-level FBI agent\u2019s act of \nleading a raid on the wrong house is one with an actual \npolicy grounding in some social, economic, or political \nconcern, the panel would have reached a different out-\ncome. \nSecond, the government\u2019s opposition is unsound by \nits own logic. The parties agree that the discretionary-\nfunction exception extends only to acts \u201csusceptible to \npolicy analysis\u201d and thus \u201cof the kind that the discretion-\nary function exception was designed to shield.\u201d BIO 11; \n\n10 \n \n \nPet. 24 (both quoting Gaubert, 499 U.S. at 322\u2013323). \nFrom there, the government spins a circular conclusion. \nIt defends the decision below because Guerra\u2019s failed at-\ntempt to locate the correct house to raid \u201cis the kind of \nact that requires discretion.\u201d (Citing Pet. App. 18a.) But \nthis conclusion says nothing about policy\u2014actual or hy-\npothetical\u2014and disregards Gaubert\u2019s second prong. \nThe Eleventh Circuit committed a similar error. \nThere\u2019s no way to square its conclusion with Gaubert\u2019s \nstatement that even \u201cobviously discretionary acts\u201d\u2014\nlike driving\u2014can fall outside the exception because, alt-\nhough they require the \u201cconstant exercise of discretion\u201d \nthey are acts that \u201ccan hardly be said to be grounded in \nregulatory policy.\u201d 499 U.S. at 325 n.7. The same is true \nfor raiding a house and most other workaday law-en-\nforcement acts.  \n3. Carelessness. Because raiding the wrong house is \nan inherently careless act, Petitioners\u2019 claims would \nhave proceeded in the Second, Fourth, and Seventh Cir-\ncuits. See also, e.g., Indian Towing Co. v. United States, \n350 U.S. 61, 68\u201369 (1955) (holding that careless mainte-\nnance of a lighthouse triggered liability). The Eleventh \nCircuit has not adopted these circuits\u2019 approach. See \nPet. 34.  \nAgain, the government does not dispute the split. It \nresponds (BIO 14) that \u201c[p]etitioners did not argue in \nthe court of appeals that Guerra had acted carelessly\u201d \nand, anyway, that the Eleventh Circuit concluded \nGuerra took \u201c\u2018reasonable\u2019 steps to correctly identify the \ntarget of the search warrant and simply made a mis-\ntake[.]\u201d (Citing Pet. App. 14a.) \n\n11 \n \n \nOn the contrary, Petitioners have consistently ar-\ngued that Guerra\u2019s \u201cacts and the manner in which they \noccurred\u201d were negligent. Pet. C.A. Br. 44. After all, Pe-\ntitioners pleaded negligence claims under the FTCA. \nThe circuits that do not apply the discretionary-function \nexception to careless acts have used negligence as a \nproxy. See Coulthurst v. United States, 214 F.3d 106, \n111 (2d Cir. 2000) (\u201cIf the plaintiff can establish that neg-\nligence of this sort occurred, his claims are not barred by \nthe DFE, and he is entitled to recover under the \nFTCA.\u201d). The panel, however, dismissed Petitioners\u2019 \nclaims without considering how Guerra\u2019s negligence af-\nfects the discretionary-function exception.  \n4. The Law-Enforcement Proviso. Finally, under \nEleventh Circuit precedent, the discretionary-function \nexception does not apply to claims embraced by the law-\nenforcement proviso. Nguyen v. United States, 556 F.3d \n1244, 1260 (11th Cir. 2009). As discussed above, this \nmeans that if the Court removes the Supremacy Clause \nbar, Petitioners\u2019 proviso claims will proceed.  \nThe Court has explained it was \u201ccrystal clear\u201d to \nCongress that the law-enforcement proviso would en-\nsure a cause of action for federal wrong-house raids. \nCarlson v. Green, 446 U.S. 14, 19\u201320 (1980). Congress en-\nacted the proviso to \u201cdeprive the Federal Government \nof the defense of sovereign immunity in cases in which \nFederal law enforcement agents, acting within the scope \nof their employment, or under color of Federal law, com-\nmit  * * *  assault, battery, false imprisonment, false ar-\nrest, malicious prosecution, or abuse of process.\u201d S. Rep. \nNo. 93-588, at 3 (1973). The text of the proviso accom-\nplishes this, extending liability for these intentional \n\n12 \n \n \ntorts \u201cwith regard to acts or omissions of investigative \nor law enforcement officers[.]\u201d 28 U.S.C. 2680(h).  \nThe government (BIO 15\u201319) offers several argu-\nments for why the Eleventh Circuit is wrong to hold \nthat the FTCA allows the claims that the law-enforce-\nment proviso says it does. The government then con-\ncludes (BIO 17) that the proviso only allows claims that \nwould otherwise be actionable under Bivens, subject to \nqualified immunity. These arguments and the govern-\nment\u2019s conclusion are incorrect, but they are better left \nfor merits briefing. We agree with the government (BIO \n22) that determining how the proviso and exception in-\nteract is \u201cnecessary to a proper construction of the \nFTCA.\u201d But this split is just one of the several that Pe-\ntitioners\u2019 case implicates. \nCONCLUSION \nThis Court should grant the petition and confirm the \navailability of the cause of action Congress conferred. \nRespectfully submitted on December 20, 2024, \nLISA C.

We request the following division of \nargument time:  30 minutes for petitioners, 15 minutes for \nrespondents, and 15 minutes for the Court-appointed amicus curiae, \nwho is supporting the judgment below.  We also request that \nrespondents be allowed to argue before the Court-appointed amicus \ncuriae, so as to mirror the presentation of issues in the parties\u2019 \nbriefs.  The Court-appointed amicus curiae agrees to this motion. \n\n2 \n \nThe Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA), 28 U.S.C. 1346(b), 2671 \net seq., waives the United States\u2019 sovereign immunity for certain \ntort claims.  That waiver is subject to 13 separate exceptions, \none set forth in each subsection of 28 U.S.C. 2680.  As relevant \nhere, the discretionary function exception in subsection (a) \npreserves the United States\u2019 immunity for claims challenging \njudgments made in the exercise of discretion.  28 U.S.C. 2680(a).  \nAnd the intentional tort exception in subsection (h) preserves the \nUnited States\u2019 immunity for claims arising out of assault, battery, \nand other specified torts.  28 U.S.C. 2680(h). \nIn 1974, Congress added a proviso to subsection (h).  Act of \nMar. 16, 1974, Pub. L. No. 93-253, \u00a7 2, 88 Stat. 50.  That proviso \nis known as the law enforcement proviso, and it covers certain \nclaims arising out of the wrongful conduct of federal investigative \nor law enforcement officers.  28 U.S.C. 2680(h).  Under Eleventh \nCircuit precedent, the law enforcement proviso removes those \nclaims not only from the scope of the intentional tort exception \nin subsection (h), but also from the scope of the FTCA\u2019s 12 other \nexceptions, including the discretionary function exception in \nsubsection (a).  See Nguyen v. United States, 556 F.3d 1244, 1256 \n(2009). \nPetitioners brought suit against respondents, seeking damages \nagainst the United States under the FTCA.  The district court \ndismissed petitioners\u2019 FTCA claims, Pet. App. 21a-32a, 34a-68a, \nand the Eleventh Circuit affirmed, id. at 2a-19a.  Relying on \n\n3 \n \ncircuit precedent, the lower courts determined that because \npetitioners\u2019 FTCA claims alleging assault, battery, and false \nimprisonment fell within the law enforcement proviso in subsection \n(h), the discretionary function exception in subsection (a) was \ncategorically inapplicable and did not preserve the United States\u2019 \nimmunity for those claims.  Id. at 59a-60a.  The lower courts \nnevertheless held that the Supremacy Clause barred those claims.  \nId. at 18a-19a, 24a-27a. \nRespondents opposed petitioners\u2019 petition for a writ of \ncertiorari, but argued that if this Court were to grant review of \nwhether the Supremacy Clause barred petitioners\u2019 claims, it should \nalso direct the parties to address \u201c[w]hether the discretionary \nfunction exception is categorically inapplicable to claims arising \nunder the law enforcement proviso to the intentional torts \nexception.\u201d  Br. in Opp. 21.  The Court granted certiorari limited \nto the Supremacy Clause issue and the \u201cthreshold\u201d statutory \nquestion that respondents had identified.  Ibid.; see 2025 WL \n301915, at *1.  The Court also appointed an amicus curiae to brief \nand argue the case in support of the judgment below as to the \nSupremacy Clause issue.  2025 WL 311282, at *1. \nDividing the argument time between respondents and the Court-\nappointed amicus curiae would be of material assistance to this \nCourt.  Respondents are the defendants in this case, and they have \na substantial interest in whether, and to what extent, petitioners\u2019 \nFTCA claims may proceed.  Respondents also have a substantial \n\n4 \n \ninterest in the proper interpretation of the FTCA and the Supremacy \nClause.  Accordingly, respondents have filed a brief addressing \nboth questions presented in this case.  That brief argues that the \nlaw enforcement proviso in subsection (h) does not modify the \nFTCA\u2019s discretionary function exception in subsection (a) and that \nthe exception therefore preserves the United States\u2019 immunity for \npetitioners\u2019 claims.  Respondents\u2019 brief also argues that, if the \nCourt reaches the issue, it should reject the lower courts\u2019 view \nthat the Supremacy Clause bars those claims. \nThe amicus curiae appointed by this Court to defend the \njudgment below has filed a brief addressing the Supremacy Clause \nissue.  That brief argues that the Eleventh Circuit correctly held \nthat the Supremacy Clause may displace state tort law liability \nunder the FTCA.  Thus, although respondents and the Court-appointed \namicus curiae both argue that the judgment below should be \naffirmed, they support affirmance on different grounds.  Given \nrespondents\u2019 and the Court-appointed amicus curiae\u2019s distinct \nviews, division of argument time would materially assist the Court \nin its consideration of this case. \n \nRespectfully submitted. \n \n \nD.

App. 2a-19a) \nis available at 2024 WL 1716235.  The order of the dis-\ntrict court (Pet. App. 21a-32a) is available at 2022 WL \n18263039.  A prior order of the district court (Pet. App. \n34a-68a) is reported at 631 F. Supp. 3d. 1281.  \nJURISDICTION \nThe judgment of the court of appeals was entered on \nApril 22, 2024.  A petition for rehearing was denied on \nMay 30, 2024. (Pet. App. 70a-71a).  On July 22, 2024, \nJustice Thomas extended the time within which to file a \npetition for a writ of certiorari to and including Septem-\nber 27, 2024, and the petition was filed on that day.  The \njurisdiction of this Court is invoked under 28 U.S.C. \n1254(1). \n\n2 \n \nSTATEMENT \n1. The Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA), 28 U.S.C. \n1346(b), 2671 et seq., enacted in 1946, generally waives \nthe sovereign immunity of the United States and cre-\nates a cause of action for damages against the United \nStates with respect to certain torts of federal employ-\nees, acting within the scope of their employment, under \ncircumstances in which a private individual would be li-\nable under state law.  See 28 U.S.C. 1346(b)(1).  The \nFTCA contains various exceptions that limit the waiver \nof sovereign immunity and the substantive scope of the \nUnited States\u2019 liability, including an exception for any \nclaim \u201cbased upon the exercise or performance or the \nfailure to exercise or perform a discretionary function \nor duty on the part of a federal agency or an employee \nof the Government, whether or not the discretion in-\nvolved be abused.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 2680(a).   \nThe FTCA also excludes from its waiver of sovereign \nimmunity most intentional torts:  \u201c[a]ny claim arising \nout of assault, battery, false imprisonment, false arrest, \nmalicious prosecution, abuse of process, libel, slander, \nmisrepresentation, deceit, or interference with contract \nrights.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 2680(h).  In 1974, Congress added a \nproviso to the intentional tort exception, known as the \nlaw enforcement proviso.  See Act of Mar. 16, 1974, Pub. \nL. No. 93-253, \u00a7 2, 88 Stat. 50.  The law enforcement \nproviso states that \u201cthe provisions of this chapter and \nsection 1346(b) of this title shall apply to any claim aris-\ning  * * *  out of assault, battery, false imprisonment, \nfalse arrest, abuse of process, or malicious prosecution\u201d \nthat is based on \u201cacts or omissions of investigative or \nlaw enforcement officers of the United States Govern-\nment.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 2680(h). \n\n3 \n \n2. In 2015, the Federal Bureau of Investigation \n(FBI) initiated an operation concerning violent gang ac-\ntivity in Georgia.  Pet. App. 4a.  The operation ultimately \nresulted in the criminal indictment of several individu-\nals, including Joseph Riley.  Id. at 3a-4a.  Officers ob-\ntained warrants for Riley\u2019s arrest and for the search of \nhis home at 3741 Landau Lane SW, Atlanta, Georgia \n30331.  Id. at 4a.     \nThe FBI assigned Special Agent Lawrence Guerra \nto lead a Special Weapons and Tactics (SWAT) team in \nthe execution of the search warrant.  Pet. App. 4a-5a.  \nThe FBI has a standard operating procedure that re-\nquires its agents to conduct a site survey or a drive-by \nbefore executing a high-risk warrant, such as the one \nfor Riley\u2019s arrest.  Id. at 5a.  The FBI, however, does \nnot have any policies that govern how to locate or navi-\ngate to a target address.  Ibid.   \nGuerra took several steps in preparation to execute \nthe warrant.  He reviewed information that other FBI \nagents had obtained through surveillance of Riley and \n3741 Landau Lane.  Pet. App. 4a-6a.  He conducted a \nsite survey of 3741 Landau Lane, during which he took \nphotographs and identified specific features of the home \nso that he could locate the property when executing the \nwarrant in the early morning.  Id. at 5a.  Guerra noted \nthat the house was beige and split-level, located on a \ncorner lot, had a driveway and garage facing a separate \nstreet that ran perpendicular to the front door, and had \na large tree in the front corner of the property.  Ibid.  \nGuerra also wrote tactical notes outlining how his team \nwould execute the warrant, and he attended an opera-\ntional briefing, which included presentations on and \nphotographs of Riley and 3741 Landau Lane.  Id. at 6a.  \n\n4 \n \nIn the pre-dawn hours of October 18, 2017, Guerra \nconducted a further drive-by with FBI Special Agent \nMichael Lemoine.  Pet. App. 4a, 6a.  Navigating in com-\nplete darkness, Guerra used his personal GPS device to \nlocate 3741 Landau Lane.  Ibid.  When the GPS unit \nalerted that they had arrived at 3741 Landau Lane, \nGuerra observed what he believed to be the same house \nhe had seen during his previous site survey: the home \nwas beige and split-level, located on a corner lot, had a \ntight stairway and stoop leading to the front door with \nwindows on either side, had a driveway and garage fac-\ning a separate street that ran perpendicular to the front \ndoor, and had a large tree in the front corner of the \nproperty.  Id. at 6a-7a.  Guerra also observed a black \nCamaro in the driveway, which he would later use as a \nreference point to locate 3741 Landau Lane.  Id. at 7a.   \nUnbeknownst to Guerra and Lemoine, however, the \nGPS had directed them to a different home\u20143756 Den-\nville Trace, petitioners\u2019 residence.  Pet. App. 6a-7a.  Pe-\ntitioners\u2019 home at 3756 Denville Trace faces Landau \nLane and is a few houses (approximately 436 feet) from \n3741 Landau Lane.  Ibid.  The house number does not \nappear on the house itself; instead, it appears on the \nmailbox and is not visible from the street.  Id. at 7a.   \nThe same day\u2014and while it was still dark out\u2014\nGuerra, Lemoine, and other agents left for 3741 Landau \nLane in a caravan of vehicles.  Pet. App. 7a.  Guerra \nidentified what he believed to be 3741 Landau Lane \nbased on the black Camaro, his prior preparation, and \nthe morning drive-by.  Ibid.  He directed that his vehicle \nstop in front of the house, and the other vehicles fol-\nlowed suit.  Ibid.  The members of the SWAT team then \nassembled in their positions, and after Guerra knocked \n\n5 \n \nand announced the presence of law enforcement, agents \nentered the home.  Id. at 7a-8a.  \nThe agents were in the home for approximately five \nminutes before realizing their mistake.  Pet. App. 39a.  \nDuring that time, the SWAT team members found peti-\ntioners Hilliard Toi Cliatt and Curtrina Martin in a \ncloset, where Cliatt kept a shotgun for protection.  Id. \nat 3a, 8a.  With their guns pointed, agents pulled Cliatt \nout of the closet and placed him in handcuffs.  Id. at 8a.   \nA SWAT team member also pointed a gun at Martin \nwhile instructing her to keep her hands up.  Ibid.  Shortly \nafter detaining Cliatt, however, the officers realized \nthat they had entered the wrong house.  Ibid.  An agent \nimmediately lifted Cliatt from the ground and uncuffed \nhim.  Ibid.  Guerra advised petitioners that he would re-\nturn to explain what had happened.  Id. at 8a-9a.   \nThe agents promptly executed the search warrant at \n3741 Landau Lane, making an arrest of Riley as he at-\ntempted to flee.  Pet. App. 9a.  Once Riley and 3741 Lan-\ndau Lane were secured, Guerra returned to petitioners\u2019 \nhome, where he apologized, provided his business card \nand the name of his supervisor, documented the damage \nto the home, and advised petitioners that the FBI would \nhandle the damages repairs.  Ibid.  \n3. In September 2019, petitioners brought suit \nagainst the United States under the FTCA.  Pet. App. \n9a.  Petitioners raised several claims based on state tort \nlaw, including, as relevant here, negligence, negli-\ngent/intentional infliction of emotional distress, tres-\npass and interference with private property, false im-\nprisonment, and assault and battery.  Ibid.1  \n \n1  Petitioners also brought a claim against Guerra under Bivens v. \nSix Unknown Named Agents of Federal Bureau of Narcotics, 403 \n \n\n6 \n \nThe district court granted in part the government\u2019s \nmotion for summary judgment.  Pet. App. 34a-68a.  The \ncourt held that the discretionary function exception in \nthe FTCA barred petitioners\u2019 claims for negligence, \nnegligent/intentional infliction of emotional distress, \ntrespass and interference with private property.  Id. at \n58a.  The court denied summary judgment, however, \nwith respect to two claims\u2014for false imprisonment and \nfor assault and battery\u2014that involved torts listed in the \nlaw enforcement proviso.  Id. at 59a-60a.  The court ex-\nplained that under Eleventh Circuit precedent, claims \nthat implicate the law enforcement proviso may proceed \neven if the acts giving rise to the claim involve a discre-\ntionary function.  Ibid.; see Nguyen v. United States, \n556 F.3d 1244, 1256 (11th Cir. 2009).   \nUpon a motion for reconsideration, the district court \ngranted the government\u2019s motion for summary judg-\nment in full and dismissed the complaint.  Pet. App. 21a-\n32a.  In its reconsideration order, the court, applying \nrecent Eleventh Circuit precedent, held that the Su-\npremacy Clause of the Constitution precluded petition-\ners from bringing their false imprisonment and assault \nand battery claims against the United States.  Id. at \n26a-27a (citing Kordash v. United States, 51 F.4th 1289 \n(11th Cir. 2022)).   \n4. The court of appeals affirmed in an unpublished, \nper curiam decision.  See Pet. App. 2a-19a.   \nThe court of appeals first held that the discretionary \nfunction exception barred petitioners\u2019 claims for torts \n \nU.S. 388 (1971), alleging that Guerra\u2019s mistaken execution of the \nwarrant at their house had violated their Fourth Amendment rights.  \nPet. App. 9a.  The court of appeals affirmed the dismissal of that \nclaim on qualified immunity grounds.  Id. at 13a-15a.  Petitioners do \nnot seek review of that holding.  See Pet. 10 n.1.     \n\n7 \n \nthat were not listed in the law enforcement proviso, i.e., \n\u201ctrespass and interference with private property,     \nnegligent/intentional infliction of emotional distress, \nand negligence.\u201d  Pet. App. 17a.  The court explained \nthat the discretionary function exception to the FTCA \n\u201cexempts from liability state-tort claims arising from a \ngovernment official\u2019s performance of a duty or function \nthat involves discretion.\u201d  Id. at 16a.  And here, the court \nobserved, Guerra \u201cenjoyed discretion\u201d under FBI poli-\ncies as to how to prepare for the execution of the war-\nrant, and his decision was \u201c\u200a\u2018susceptible to policy analy-\nsis,\u2019\u200a\u201d id. at 17a-18a (quoting Mesa v. United States, 123 \nF.3d 1435, 1438 (11th Cir. 1997)).   \nThe court of appeals also affirmed the dismissal of \npetitioners\u2019 false imprisonment and assault and battery \nclaims.  The court held that the Supremacy Clause, \n\u201c[s]imilar to the discretionary function exception,\u201d \u201cen-\nsures that states do not impede or burden the execution \nof federal law.\u201d  Pet. App. 16a.  Under circuit precedent, \n\u201c[t]he government may invoke the Supremacy Clause \nagainst state-tort liability\u201d if it demonstrates that the \nofficial\u2019s acts (i) \u201c\u200a\u2018have some nexus with furthering fed-\neral policy\u2019\u200a\u201d and (ii) \u201c\u200a\u2018can reasonably be characterized \nas complying with the full range of federal law.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Id. at \n17a (quoting Kordash, 51 F.4th at 1293).  The court held \nthat Guerra\u2019s acts had a \u201c\u200a\u2018nexus with furthering federal \npolicy\u2019\u200a\u201d because there was \u201cno doubt that Guerra acted \nwithin the scope of his discretionary authority when he \nprepared for and executed the search warrant.\u201d  Id. at \n19a (citation omitted).  And the court concluded that \nGuerra\u2019s actions complied with the \u201cfull range\u201d of fed-\neral law because he did not \u201cviolate[] the Fourth Amend-\nment.\u201d  Ibid.  The court explained that \u201can officer who \nmakes \u2018reasonable effort[s] to ascertain and identify \n\n8 \n \nthe\u2019 target address of a valid search warrant complies \nwith the Fourth Amendment,\u201d and \u201cthe decisions that \nGuerra made,\u201d while mistaken, were the \u201ckind of rea-\nsonable mistakes that the Fourth Amendment contem-\nplates,\u201d as they involved the execution of \u201ca high-risk \nwarrant\u201d in a \u201crapidly-changing and dangerous situa-\ntion.\u201d  Id. at 13a-14a (citation omitted; brackets in orig-\ninal).   \nARGUMENT \nPetitioners contend (Pet. 23-34) that the court of ap-\npeals misapplied the discretionary function exception in \nSection 2680(a) to dismiss their claims for trespass, in-\nterference with private property, negligent/intentional \ninfliction of emotional distress, and negligence.  That \ncontention lacks merit.  The court of appeals correctly \nheld (Pet. App. 15a-18a) that the discretionary function \nexception barred those claims, and its factbound and \nnonprecedential decision is consistent with decisions of \nthis Court and other courts of appeals.   \nPetitioners further contend (Pet. 16-23) that the \ncourt of appeals erred in affirming the dismissal of their \nclaims for false imprisonment and assault and battery.  \nPetitioners correctly observe that the court\u2019s reasoning \nfor rejecting those claims differs from the approach of \nother circuits, but that disagreement did not affect the \nproper disposition of the case.  The court correctly held \nthat petitioners\u2019 claims are barred, and no court of ap-\npeals to have addressed the issue would have reached a \ndifferent result.  Accordingly, this Court\u2019s review is not \nwarranted.     \n1. The court of appeals correctly held that the dis-\ncretionary function exception to the FTCA bars peti-\ntioners\u2019 claims for trespass and interference with pri-\n\n9 \n \nvate property, negligent/intentional infliction of emo-\ntional distress, and negligence.  Insofar as petitioners \nchallenge that holding, they do so on fact-specific \ngrounds, and their effort to identify relevant disagree-\nments among the courts of appeals is without merit.      \n \na. The FTCA\u2019s discretionary function exception pro-\nvides that the United States\u2019 waiver of sovereign im-\nmunity does not apply to claims based on an employee\u2019s \n\u201cexercise or performance or the failure to exercise or \nperform a discretionary function or duty  * * *, whether \nor not the discretion involved be abused.\u201d  28 U.S.C. \n2680(a).  The exception serves to \u201cprevent judicial \u2018sec-\nond-guessing\u200a\u2019 of legislative and administrative deci-\nsions  * * *  through the medium of an action in tort.\u201d  \nUnited States v. Gaubert, 499 U.S. 315, 323 (1991) (cita-\ntion omitted).   \nThis Court has established a two-part inquiry to \nguide application of the discretionary function excep-\ntion.  Gaubert, 499 U.S. at 322-323.  First, a court must \ndetermine whether the conduct challenged by the plain-\ntiff was \u201cdiscretionary in nature\u201d\u2014that is, whether it \ninvolved \u201c\u200a\u2018an element of judgment or choice.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Id. at \n322 (citation omitted).  \u201cThe requirement of judgment \nor choice is not satisfied if a \u2018federal statute, regulation, \nor policy specifically prescribes a course of action for an \nemployee to follow,\u2019 because \u2018the employee has no right-\nful option but to adhere to the directive.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Ibid. (quot-\ning Berkovitz v. United States, 486 U.S. 531, 536 (1988)).  \nSecond, a court must evaluate \u201cwhether that judgment \nis of the kind that the discretionary function exception \nwas designed to shield,\u201d id. at 322-323 (quoting Berkovitz, \n486 U.S. at 536), meaning it is \u201csusceptible to policy \nanalysis,\u201d id. at 325. \n\n10 \n \nGuerra\u2019s conduct in executing the search warrant \nsatisfied the Gaubert standard.  As the court of appeals \nobserved, the FBI did not have policies that \u201cdictate[d] \nhow agents are to prepare for warrant executions,\u201d and \nGuerra instead exercised discretion as to how to inves-\ntigate the location.  Pet. App. 18a (emphasis omitted).  \nThat decision required judgment:  an agent must weigh, \namong other things, \u201cthe urgency of apprehending the \nsubject,\u201d the need to \u201ckeep the investigation secret,\u201d \nand \u201cavailable resources\u201d in allocating agents across \n\u201cthe many investigations for which they are responsi-\nble.\u201d  Mesa v. United States, 123 F.3d 1435, 1438 (11th \nCir. 1997).  Here, Guerra faced a \u201crapidly-changing and \ndangerous situation,\u201d Pet. App. 14a, and he exercised \ndiscretion to conduct his drive-by in the dark, with the \nheadlights dimmed, to \u201cavoid detection\u201d before execut-\ning a high-risk warrant, id. at 37a.  While Guerra did \nnot have discretion to intentionally \u201craid the wrong \nhouse,\u201d Pet. 31, he did have discretion in determining \nthe preparatory steps necessary to \u201clocate and identify\u201d \nthe target address,\u201d Pet. App. 18a.    \nGuerra\u2019s conduct likewise satisfied the second com-\nponent of Gaubert\u2019s two-part inquiry because his \u201cdeci-\nsion as to how to locate and identify the subject of an \narrest warrant  * * *  is susceptible to policy analysis.\u201d  \nPet. App. 18a (quoting Mesa, 123 F.3d at 1438).  The \nfactors described above\u2014which include competing con-\nsiderations like officer and public safety, resource con-\nstraints, tactical considerations, and accuracy\u2014are all \n\u201cfundamentally rooted in policy considerations,\u201d for which \n\u201cjudicial second-guessing\u201d is not appropriate.  Mesa, 123 \nF.3d at 1438.  The court of appeals therefore correctly \nheld that Guerra\u2019s preparatory efforts here \u201cf\u200a[e]ll \n\n11 \n \nsquarely within the discretionary function exception.\u201d  \nPet. App. 18a (citation omitted).  \nb. Petitioners briefly contend (Pet. 28-30) that the \ncourt of appeals erred in holding that Guerra\u2019s execu-\ntion of the warrant was \u201csusceptible to policy analysis\u201d \nand thus \u201c\u200a\u2018of the kind that the discretionary function \nexception was designed to shield.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Gaubert, 499 U.S. \nat 322-323, 325 (citation omitted).  In petitioners\u2019 view \n(Pet. 30), the proper inquiry asks whether a federal em-\nployee\u2019s acts \u201cactually\u201d\u2014\u201cnot just hypothetically\u201d\u2014\nwere grounded in policy analysis.   \nThis Court has long since rejected the subjective \nstandard that petitioners advocate.  In Gaubert, this \nCourt explained that the \u201cfocus of the inquiry is not on \nthe agent\u2019s subjective intent in exercising the discretion \nconferred by statute or regulation, but on the nature of \nthe actions taken.\u201d  499 U.S. at 325.  Thus, the relevant \nquestion is not how an officer thinks about his or her \nconduct; the question is whether the conduct is of the \n\u201ckind\u201d that, by its nature, can be \u201cgrounded in the pol-\nicy of the regulatory regime.\u201d  Ibid. (emphasis added).  \nConsistent with that approach, the Eleventh Circuit fo-\ncused on the nature of Guerra\u2019s conduct, explaining that \n\u201ca federal officer\u2019s \u2018decision as to how to locate and iden-\ntify the subject of an arrest warrant\u2019\u200a\u201d is the kind of act \nthat requires discretion.  Pet. App. 18a (quoting Mesa, \n123 F.3d at 1438).   \nContrary to petitioners\u2019 assertion (Pet. 28-30), the \ncourts of appeals are unanimous, not divided, in follow-\ning this Court\u2019s guidance.  Petitioners recognize that \nnine circuits have held that an official\u2019s act need \u201cnot be \nactually grounded in policy considerations,\u201d so long as it \nis, \u201cby its nature, susceptible to a policy analysis.\u201d  Pet. \n28 (quoting Miller v. United States, 163 F.3d 591, 593 \n\n12 \n \n(9th Cir. 1998)).  And contrary to petitioners\u2019 contention \n(Pet. 28-30), the Third Circuit likewise examines the \n\u201cnature of the actions taken,\u201d not the \u201csubjective in-\ntent\u201d of the agent.  Baer v. United States, 722 F.3d 168, \n175 (2013) (quoting Gaubert, 499 U.S. at 325) (emphasis \nomitted); see Middleton v. United States Fed. Bureau \nof Prisons, 658 Fed. Appx. 167, 169-170 (3d Cir. 2016) \n(per curiam) (concluding that task was susceptible to \npolicy analysis without considering whether officials ac-\ntually engaged in such analysis).  \nc. Petitioners also maintain that review is warranted \nto resolve two disagreements among the courts of ap-\npeal as to how the discretionary function exception ap-\nplies.  That contention is meritless.  To the extent any \ndisagreements exists among the courts of appeals, this \ncase does not implicate them.   \ni. Petitioners contend (Pet. 31-33) that the courts of \nappeals disagree on whether the discretionary function \nexception is applicable where a federal employee\u2019s con-\nduct runs afoul of the Constitution.  That question played \nno role in the court of appeals\u2019 decision.  The court held \nthat \u201cGuerra\u2019s actions did not violate the Fourth Amend-\nment.\u201d  Pet. App. 19a.  In particular, the Court concluded \nthat that Guerra\u2019s actions \u201cconstitute[d] the kind of rea-\nsonable mistakes that the Fourth Amendment contem-\nplates.\u201d  Id. at 14a.  Petitioners do not challenge that fact-\nbound determination, see Pet. i, and this case therefore \npresents no opportunity to resolve any differences \namong the courts of appeals as to the application of the \ndiscretionary function exception to unconstitutional \nconduct.2 \n \n2 Petitioners argue that the court of appeals spoke \u201cimprecise[ly]\u201d \nwhen it stated that \u201c\u200a\u2018Guerra\u2019s actions did not violate the Fourth \n \n\n13 \n \nPetitioners also overstate the extent of disagree-\nment on that question.  The government agrees that a \nconstitutional mandate, no less than a federal statu-\ntory or regulatory one, can eliminate a government of-\nficial\u2019s discretion when it is sufficiently specific or when \nan authoritative construction and application with suffi-\ncient specificity was clearly established before the of-\nficer acted.  Many of the cases that petitioners cite are \nconsistent with that position, as the government ex-\nplained in its brief in opposition (at 8-11) in Shivers v. \nUnited States, 142 S. Ct. 1361 (2022) (No. 21-682).3  And this \nCourt has repeatedly denied petitions for writs of certiorari \nraising similar issues.  See ibid.; Linder v. United States, \n141 S. Ct. 159 (2020) (No. 19-1082); Chaidez Campos v. \nUnited States, 139 S. Ct. 1317 (2019) (No. 18-234); Cas-\ntro v. United States, 562 U.S. 1168 (2011) (No. 10-309); \nWelch v. United States, 546 U.S. 1214 (2006) (No. 05-\n529).   \n \nAmendment,\u2019\u200a\u201d and instead held only that Guerra\u2019s actions did not \nviolate \u201c\u200a\u2018clearly established law,\u2019\u200a\u201d without reaching the question of \nwhether there was a violation of substantive Fourth Amendment \nlaw.  Pet. 13 n.4 (citations omitted); see Pet. 32-33.  That is incorrect.  \nIn addition to \u201cdetermin[ing] whether [Guerra\u2019s] actions violated \nthe Fourth Amendment\u201d in its qualified immunity analysis, the \ncourt also considered as part of its Supremacy Clause analysis \nwhether Guerra \u201ccomplied with the full range of the Fourth Amend-\nment.\u201d  Pet. App. 19a; see id. at 17a (describing inquiry \u201c[w]hen \nfaced with the determination whether the actions a law enforcement \nofficer took comply with the Fourth Amendment\u201d).  It concluded \nthat Guerra\u2019s actions did so.  Id. at 19a.   \n3  After the government\u2019s filing in Shivers, the First Circuit held \nthat constitutional violations may preclude application of the discre-\ntionary function exception even if the violation in question was not \nclearly established.  See Torres-Estrada v. Cases, 88 F.4th 14, 20-23 \n(2023).    \n\n14 \n \nii. This case also does not implicate any conflict \namong the courts of appeals as to whether \u201ccareless acts\u201d \nfall outside the discretionary function exception.  See Pet. \n34.  As petitioners acknowledge (ibid.), the Eleventh Cir-\ncuit has not addressed that question, and it had no oc-\ncasion to do so in this case.  Petitioners did not argue in \nthe court of appeals that Guerra had acted carelessly.  \nSee Pet. C.A. Br. 34-53.  And the court did not treat his \nacts as careless; on the contrary, it recognized that \nGuerra took \u201creasonable\u201d steps to correctly identify the \ntarget of the search warrant and simply made a mistake \nin the \u201crapidly-changing and dangerous situation of exe-\ncuting a high-risk warrant at night.\u201d  Pet. App. 14a.  \nThis case therefore would come out no differently re-\ngardless of whether careless acts fall outside the discre-\ntionary function exception.    \n2. The court of appeals also correctly affirmed the \ndistrict court\u2019s dismissal of petitioners\u2019 claims for false \nimprisonment and assault and battery.  Those claims \nare barred by the discretionary function exception, the \nsame as petitioners\u2019 other state-law tort claims.  Every \nother court of appeals to consider the issue would have \nresolved this case in the United States\u2019 favor on that ba-\nsis.  While the Eleventh Circuit used a different ra-\ntionale to reach the same result, that methodological \ndisagreement makes no practical difference and does \nnot warrant this Court\u2019s review.   \na. For the same reason that petitioners\u2019 other tort \nclaims cannot proceed, see pp. 8-12, supra, the discre-\ntionary function exception precludes petitioners\u2019 claims \nfor false imprisonment and assault and battery.  In ar-\nguing otherwise, petitioners suggest (Pet. 26-27) that \nthe exception is categorically inapplicable to torts listed \n\n15 \n \nin the law enforcement proviso of Section 2680(h).  That \nis wrong.  \ni. \u201c[A] waiver of the Government\u2019s sovereign im-\nmunity will be strictly construed, in terms of its scope, \nin favor of the sovereign.\u201d  Lane v. Pena, 518 U.S. 187, \n192 (1996).  When Congress enacted the law enforce-\nment proviso in 1974, it placed the proviso within the \nintentional tort exception, Section 2680(h), and thereby \nmodified that particular exception to the FTCA.  Al-\nthough provisos sometimes have a broader import, it is \ncustomary to use a proviso to refer only to things cov-\nered by the preceding clause.  See United States v. Mor-\nrow, 266 U.S. 531, 535 (1925) (\u201c[T]he presumption is \nthat, in accordance with its primary purpose, [a proviso] \nrefers only to the provision to which it is attached.\u201d); \nAntonin Scalia & Bryan A. Garner, Reading Law:  In-\nterpretation of Legal Texts 154 (2012) (\u201cA proviso con-\nditions the principal matter that it qualifies\u2014almost al-\nways the matter immediately preceding.\u201d).  Here, the \ntext, structure, and history of Section 2680 all strongly \nreinforce the conclusion that the law enforcement pro-\nviso has the customary scope of modifying only the pre-\nceding clause. \nSignificantly, Congress did not make the law en-\nforcement proviso an amendment to any of the other ex-\nceptions in Section 2680, such as the discretionary func-\ntion exception, which it could have done if it had in-\ntended to modify those preexisting exceptions as well.  \nAnd the conclusion that the proviso relates only to the \npreceding clause of subsection (h) is reinforced by the \nproviso\u2019s reference specifically to some (but not all) of \nthe intentional torts excepted in that prior clause.  See \n28 U.S.C. 2680(h) (\u201cProvided, That, with regard to acts \n\n16 \n \nor omissions of investigative or law enforcement offic-\ners of the United States,\u201d the FTCA \u201cshall apply\u201d to \nclaims alleging one of the select named intentional \ntorts.).  Moreover, the final sentence of Section 2680(h) \nfurnishes, \u201c[f]or the purpose of this subsection,\u201d a defi-\nnition of the term \u201c\u200a\u2018investigative or law enforcement of-\nficer.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Ibid. (emphasis added).  Because that term ap-\npears only in the law enforcement proviso, the final sen-\ntence in subsection (h) thereby links the proviso exclu-\nsively to the intentional tort exception in \u201cthis subsec-\ntion\u201d in that additional way as well.  Ibid. \nFurther still, the law enforcement proviso expressly \nstates that \u201cthe provisions of [Chapter 171  * * *  shall \napply\u201d to claims described within the proviso, 28 U.S.C. \n2680(h) (emphasis added), and the discretionary func-\ntion exception in 28 U.S.C. 2680(a) is one of the provi-\nsions of Chapter 171.  See Simmons v. Himmelreich, \n578 U.S. 621, 627 (2016) (interpreting the FTCA and \nholding that, \u201c[a]bsent persuasive indications to the \ncontrary,\u201d the Court will \u201cpresume Congress says what \nit means and means what it says\u201d).  Given the text and \nplacement of the law enforcement proviso in the statute, \nthe proviso is properly read as a modification only of the \nfirst clause of Section 2680(h)\u2014the clause excepting al-\ntogether certain intentional torts from the FTCA. \nA broader reading of the law enforcement proviso\u2014\nas a limitation not only upon the intentional tort excep-\ntion but also upon the other exceptions in Section \n2680\u2014would allow tort suits against the United States \nthat Congress plainly intended to bar.  Under petition-\ners\u2019 interpretation, a plaintiff alleging an intentional \ntort with respect to acts or omissions of law enforce-\nment officers could bring an FTCA claim arising in a \nforeign country notwithstanding 28 U.S.C. 2680(k), \n\n17 \n \nwhich prohibits all tort claims \u201carising in a foreign coun-\ntry.\u201d  See Sosa v. Alvarez-Machain, 542 U.S. 692, 699-712 \n(2004) (holding that foreign country exception barred \nFTCA claim for false arrest).  The language and struc-\nture of Section 2680 as a whole therefore do not support \nthe counterintuitive suggestion that Congress intended \nto override foundational compromises in the FTCA and \npermit suits arising abroad, or from discretionary func-\ntions, simply because the plaintiff\u2019s claim involves an al-\nleged tort by a law enforcement officer.  \nii. Notwithstanding the plain text of the statute, pe-\ntitioners (Pet. 26-27) and their amici (Members of Con-\ngress Amici Br. 4-13) contend that the government\u2019s po-\nsition conflicts with Congress\u2019s purpose in enacting the \nlaw enforcement proviso.  As this Court has recognized, \nit must \u201cfollow the text even if doing so will supposedly \nundercut a basic objective of the statute.\u201d  Baker Botts \nL.L.P. v. ASARCO LLC, 576 U.S. 121, 135 (2015) (cita-\ntion and internal quotation marks omitted).  But here, \nthe history and context of the law enforcement proviso \nreinforce that it was not intended to negate the discre-\ntionary function exception.  \nCongress adopted the proviso \u201cas a counterpart to \nthe Bivens case and its progen[y], in that it waives the \ndefense of sovereign immunity so as to make the Gov-\nernment independently liable in damages for the same \ntype of conduct that is alleged to have occurred in \nBivens.\u201d  Carlson v. Green, 446 U.S. 14, 20 (1980) (quot-\ning S. Rep. No. 588, 93d Cong., 1st Sess. 3 (1973) (Sen-\nate Report)).  Defendants in Bivens actions are entitled \nto immunity when their actions do not violate clearly es-\ntablished constitutional proscriptions, Harlow v. Fitz-\ngerald, 457 U.S. 800, 813-819 (1982), and as noted above, \n\n18 \n \nthat same kind of immunity is incorporated into the dis-\ncretionary function exception, see p. 13, supra.  The ap-\nplication of the discretionary function exception to con-\nduct covered by the law enforcement proviso thus is \nconsistent with the FTCA serving as a counterpart to \nBivens.  See Carlson, 446 U.S. at 19-20 (\u201c[T]he congres-\nsional comments accompanying [the law enforcement \nproviso in Section 2680(h)] made it crystal clear that \nCongress views FTCA and Bivens as parallel, comple-\nmentary causes of action.\u201d). \nThe construction of the law enforcement proviso and \ndiscretionary function exception advanced by the gov-\nernment therefore best gives effect to every provision \nof the statute and does not leave the law enforcement \nproviso without effect.  To start, many claims arising \nfrom the intentional torts of law enforcement officers do \nnot implicate discretionary functions at all.  See, e.g., \nLinder v. United States, 937 F.3d 1087, 1091 (7th Cir. \n2019), cert. denied, 141 S. Ct. 159 (2020) (explaining that \nit is clearly established that law enforcement officers do \nnot have discretion to commit perjury).  Likewise, the \nUnited States will not be shielded by the discretionary \nfunction exception under the FTCA for the conduct of \nfederal law enforcement officers if they act in violation \nof a clearly established constitutional, statutory, or reg-\nulatory directive, just as individual officers are not en-\ntitled to qualified immunity under Bivens when they vi-\nolate clearly established law.   \nThe law enforcement proviso accordingly retains full \nforce when law enforcement officers \u201cact in bad faith or \nwithout legal justification,\u201d including when they con-\nduct the type of \u201craids\u201d that Congress intended the law \nenforcement proviso to deter.  Senate Report 3.  Congress \nadded the proviso to create a cause of action for \u201cthe \n\n19 \n \nsame type of conduct that [wa]s alleged to have oc-\ncurred in Bivens,\u201d Carlson, 446 U.S. at 20 (quoting Sen-\nate Report 3)\u2014i.e., the raid of a home \u201cwithout cause, \nconsent or warrant,\u201d Bivens v. Six Unknown Named \nAgents of Fed. Bureau of Narcotics, 403 U.S. 388, 390 \nn.1 (1971) (citation omitted).  That also was true of the \nCollinsville raids that petitioners cite (Pet. 26) as the \nbasis for the law enforcement proviso.  Those \u201c\u200a\u2018no-knock\u2019 \nraids  * * *  into two different homes,\u201d involving the \n\u201csame Justice Department agents,\u201d were conducted \n\u201cwithout warrants\u201d and in an \u201cabusive\u201d fashion.  Senate \nReport 2-3 (emphasis added).  This case\u2014involving an \nofficer\u2019s \u201creasonable mistakes\u201d when \u201cexecuting a high-\nrisk warrant\u201d in a \u201crapidly-changing and dangerous sit-\nuation\u201d\u2014bears no resemblance to those warrantless \nraids.  Pet. App. 14a.   \nb. As petitioners acknowledge (Pet. 25), every court \nof appeals\u2014except the Eleventh Circuit\u2014to consider \nthe issue has held that the discretionary function excep-\ntion applies to the tort claims listed in the law enforce-\nment proviso in Section 2680(h).  See Linder, 937 F.3d \nat 1088-1089 (rejecting argument that the law enforce-\nment \u201cproviso overrides the rest of [Section] 2680\u201d); \nJoiner v. United States, 955 F.3d 399, 406 (5th Cir. \n2020) (\u201c[T]he law enforcement proviso does not negate \nthe discretionary function exception.\u201d); Medina v. \nUnited States, 259 F.3d 220, 228-229 (4th Cir. 2001) \n(where the discretionary function exception applies, it \ncontrols, even if the plaintiff alleges intentional torts \nwithin the law enforcement proviso); Gray v. Bell, 712 \nF.2d 490, 507-508 (D.C. Cir. 1983) (same), cert. denied, \n465 U.S. 1100 (1984); Caban v. United States, 671 F.2d \n1230, 1234 (2d Cir. 1982) (law enforcement proviso must \n\n20 \n \nbe read in conjunction with discretionary function ex-\nception); see also Gasho v. United States, 39 F.3d 1420, \n1433-1434 (9th Cir. 1994) (where the FTCA exception in \n28 U.S.C. 2680(c) applies, that exception controls not-\nwithstanding the law enforcement proviso), cert. de-\nnied, 515 U.S. 1144 (1995).  Because Guerra\u2019s conduct \nfalls within the discretionary function exception, see pp. \n8-12, supra, every other court of appeals would have up-\nheld the district court\u2019s judgment on that basis.    \nc. The court of appeals affirmed the district court\u2019s \njudgment on a different rationale.  The court of appeals \nstated that there was \u201cno doubt that Guerra acted \nwithin the scope of his discretionary authority when he \nprepared for and executed the search warrant.\u201d  Pet. \nApp. at 19a.  The court was bound, however, by circuit \nprecedent holding that torts listed in the law enforce-\nment proviso fall outside the scope of the discretionary \nfunction exception.  See Nguyen v. United States, 556 \nF.3d 1244, 1256 (11th Cir. 2009).  The court therefore \naffirmed dismissal of petitioners\u2019 false imprisonment \nand assault and battery claims on different grounds:  It \napplied other circuit precedent holding that, \u201c[s]imilar \nto the discretionary function exception, the Supremacy \nClause ensures that states do not impede or burden the \nexecution of federal law.\u201d  Pet. App. 16a (citing Denson \nv. United States, 574 F.3d 1318, 1336-1337 (11th Cir. \n2009), cert. denied, 560 U.S. 952 (2010)).  \nThe court of appeals\u2019 premise is sound.  Congress could \nnot have intended that the United States would be held \nliable for the actions of its law enforcement officers that \nare discretionary and within the scope of their official \nduties, because such conduct would ordinarily be privi-\nleged.  For the reasons explained above, however, that \nprotection for the actions of law enforcement officers is \n\n21 \n \nlocated in the FTCA itself, with no need to consider the \nSupremacy Clause.  See pp. 14-19, supra.  Although the \ncourt did not analyze the issue in that way, any error is \nirrelevant to the proper disposition of this case.  As ex-\nplained above, petitioners\u2019 claims must fail because they \narise out of Guerra\u2019s exercise of a discretionary func-\ntion.  See pp. 8-12, supra.   \nNor does the disagreement between the Eleventh \nCircuit and the other courts of appeals regarding the \ninterplay of the discretionary function exception and \nthe law enforcement proviso warrant this Court\u2019s re-\nview.  The Eleventh Circuit \u201cstands alone\u201d in holding \nthat the discretionary function exception is inapplicable \nto the torts listed in the law enforcement proviso.  \nLinder, 937 F.3d at 1089.  But the decision below rests \non the same fundamental insight as the other courts of \nappeals:  The United States cannot face liability for the \nacts of a law enforcement officer who \u201cacted within the \nscope of his discretionary authority.\u201d  Pet. App. 17a.  \nThus, the disagreement as to methodology has little \npractical significance, and the Court has previously de-\nnied petitions implicating the disagreement.  See \nLinder, 141 S. Ct. at 159; Denson v. United States, 560 \nU.S. 952, 952 (2010).  The same result is warranted here. \nd. If the Court were to grant a writ of certiorari to \nreview the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s application of the Su-\npremacy Clause to bar certain FTCA claims, it should \nalso direct the parties to address an additional question:  \nWhether the discretionary function exception is cate-\ngorically inapplicable to claims arising under the law \nenforcement proviso to the intentional torts exception.  \nAs petitioners acknowledge (Pet. 25), the court of ap-\npeals reached the constitutional question only because \nit could not address the statutory question under circuit \n\n22 \n \nlaw.  Resolving that threshold question is therefore nec-\nessary to a proper construction of the FTCA.  And, as \nthe other courts of appeals to address the question have \nrecognized, there is no sound basis for holding that a \nclaim falls outside the scope of the discretionary func-\ntion exception just because it is not separately barred \nby the enumerated torts exception.  For the reasons \ngiven above, however, the Court should deny the peti-\ntion for a writ of certiorari.   \nCONCLUSION \nThe petition for a writ of certiorari should be denied.  \nRespectfully submitted. \n \n \nELIZABETH B.

Rep. No. 93-588 (1973) .............................................. 4, 11 \n \n \n\n1 \n \n \nREPLY ARGUMENT \nThe government agrees that the circuits are split \nover both questions presented: \nQP 1: \u201cPetitioners correctly observe that the [Elev-\nenth Circuit]\u2019s reasoning for rejecting [claims \nunder the Supremacy Clause] differs from the \napproach of other circuits[.]\u201d BIO 8. \nQP 2:  \u201cAs petitioners acknowledge  * * *  , every \ncourt of appeals\u2014except the Eleventh Cir-\ncuit\u2014to consider the issue has held that the \ndiscretionary function exception applies to \ntort claims listed in the law enforcement pro-\nviso[.]\u201d E.g., BIO 19. \nAnd the government does not dispute their importance. \nOn the contrary, it insists (BIO 22) that resolving the \nlatter split is \u201cnecessary to a proper construction of the \nFTCA.\u201d  \nEven though the government agrees that the Elev-\nenth Circuit is wrong about both the Supremacy Clause \n(BIO 20\u201321) and the discretionary-function exception \n(BIO 13\u201320), it urges this Court to leave the splits in \nplace. In its view, this case is a bad vehicle because: (1) \ncircuits other than the Eleventh Circuit apply the dis-\ncretionary-function exception to law-enforcement pro-\nviso claims; (2) the exception, as interpreted by the gov-\nernment, is expansive enough to snuff out nearly all pro-\nviso claims; and, based on this interpretation, (3) \u201cno \ncourt of appeals  * * *  would have reached a different \nresult\u201d than the Eleventh Circuit did below. BIO 8.  \nThere are two problems with this vehicle argument. \nFirst, it hinges on a circuit split\u2014one that caused the \n\n2 \n \n \nEleventh Circuit to create the Supremacy Clause bar \nand that, according to the government (BIO 22), the \nCourt must resolve to properly construe the FTCA. Sec-\nond, no court of appeals has adopted the government\u2019s \nall-encompassing interpretation of the discretionary-\nfunction exception. Many, however, have rejected it.  \nBecause FBI Special Agent Lawrence Guerra\u2019s ac-\ntions were unconstitutional, careless, and unmoored \nfrom actual policy (Pet. 23\u201334), Petitioners\u2019 claims would \nhave proceeded under one theory or another in eight cir-\ncuits. And were it not for the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s unique \nSupremacy Clause bar, Petitioners\u2019 proviso claims \nwould have proceeded below. Pet. App. 17a\u201319a, Martin \nv. United States, 2024 WL 1716235, at *6\u20138 (11th Cir. \nApr. 22, 2024). \nRather than mark this case as a bad vehicle, the BIO \nmerely offers the government\u2019s merits arguments about \nhow the Court should resolve the splits. As a result, the \nBIO complements the petition at the certiorari stage: \nBoth agree that the Eleventh Circuit is on the wrong \nside of important circuit splits, and both show that this \nCourt\u2019s intervention is necessary. Granting certiorari \nwill not only allow the Court to resolve the splits, but \nalso to address the apparent problem of unaccountable \nwrong-house raids in this country. See also Jimerson v. \nLewis, petition for cert. pending, No. 24-473 (1983 claims \nbarred by qualified immunity).  \n\n3 \n \n \nI. \nBut for the Supremacy Clause bar, Petitioners\u2019 \nclaims under the law-enforcement proviso \nwould have proceeded. \nAs we have explained (Pet. 25\u201328), Congress enacted \nthe FTCA\u2019s law-enforcement proviso in response to a \npair of federal wrong-house raids in Collinsville, Illinois, \njust like the raid here. See also Members of Congress \nAmici Br. 4\u201313 (e.g., observing that this case \u201caris[es] \nunder the precise circumstances that motivated Con-\ngress to enact the law-enforcement proviso\u201d); 28 U.S.C. \n2680(h). But the Eleventh Circuit held that the FTCA \nviolates the Supremacy Clause in this case. Pet. App. \n16a\u201319a. \nWhile the government agrees that the Eleventh Cir-\ncuit\u2019s application of the Supremacy Clause to the FTCA \nis wrong (BIO 20\u201321), it argues that any error is harm-\nless. This is incorrect. Under Eleventh Circuit prece-\ndent, Petitioners\u2019 proviso claims would have proceeded \nbut for the Supremacy Clause bar, which effectively \nholds that large swaths of the FTCA are unconstitu-\ntional. This holding, alone, merits the Court\u2019s review. \n1. In the Eleventh Circuit, Congress\u2019s waiver of sov-\nereign immunity violates the Supremacy Clause when-\never it applies to acts of federal employees that \u201chave \nsome nexus with furthering federal policy\u201d (for instance, \nif officers act \u201cwithin their discretionary authority\u201d) \n\u201cand can reasonably be characterized as complying with \nthe full range of federal law.\u201d Pet. App. 17a (quoting \nKordash v. United States, 51 F.4th 1289, 1294 (11th Cir. \n2022), and citing Denson v. United States, 574 F.3d 1318, \n1348 (11th Cir. 2009)). Although the government agrees \nthat the Supremacy Clause does not bar FTCA claims, \n\n4 \n \n \nit nonetheless contends (BIO 20) that the Eleventh Cir-\ncuit\u2019s \u201cpremise is sound.\u201d It is not.  \nBorrowing from its BIO in Denson, BIO at 25, Den-\nson v. United States, 560 U.S. 952 (2010) (mem.), the \ngovernment argues here (BIO 20) that \u201cCongress could \nnot have intended that the United States would be held \nliable for the actions of its law enforcement officers that \nare discretionary and within the scope of their official \nduties, because such conduct would ordinarily be privi-\nleged.\u201d But the government overlooks that in this case, \nunlike in Denson, the district court rejected the govern-\nment\u2019s assertion of state-law privilege to extinguish Pe-\ntitioners\u2019 proviso claims. Compare Pet. App. 63a\u201365a, \nMartin v. United States, 631 F. Supp. 3d 1281, 1299\u20131300 \n(N.D. Ga. 2022) (rejecting Georgia-law privilege argu-\nments), with Denson v. United States, 2005 WL \n8160747, at *7 (S.D. Fla. Aug. 9, 2005) (accepting Flor-\nida-law privilege arguments). Only after the district \ncourt rejected the government\u2019s privilege argument did \nit move for reconsideration here, raising the Supremacy \nClause bar for the first time. Pet. App. 22a\u201323a, Martin \nv. United States, 2022 WL 18263039, at *1 (N.D. Ga. \nDec. 30, 2022). So even if Congress somehow intended to \nexclude law-enforcement-privileged acts from the \nFTCA, but see 28 U.S.C. 1346(b)(1) (accepting \u201cprivate \nperson\u201d liability); 28 U.S.C. 2680(h); S. Rep. No. 93-588 \n(1973), Guerra\u2019s acts were not privileged. The only thing \nstanding between Petitioners and their ability to pro-\nceed on their proviso claims in the Eleventh Circuit is \nthe Supremacy Clause bar. \n2. Whatever interpretation of the discretionary-\nfunction exception ultimately emerges from the multiple \ncircuit splits, two things are clear: This case invokes the \n\n5 \n \n \ncause of action Congress created through the FTCA, \nand the Eleventh Circuit has held that cause of action \nunconstitutional under the Supremacy Clause. \nThis Court\u2019s review is needed because the Eleventh \nCircuit has imposed a constraint on Congress\u2019s power to \nwaive sovereign immunity\u2014a constitutional issue of \n\u201cobvious importance.\u201d Gonzales v. Raich, 545 U.S. 1, 9 \n(2005). As the Members of Congress note (Br. 20), the \nEleventh Circuit\u2019s application of this constraint \u201ceffec-\ntively declared the FTCA unconstitutional in its core ap-\nplications.\u201d This Court regularly grants review when a \nlower court \u201cexercise[s]  * * *  the grave power of annul-\nling an Act of Congress.\u201d United States v. Gainey, 380 \nU.S. 63, 65 (1965); see, e.g., United States v. Bajakajian, \n524 U.S. 321, 327 (1998) (\u201cBecause the Court of Appeals\u2019 \nholding  * * *  invalidated a portion of an Act of Con-\ngress, we granted certiorari.\u201d).  \nThe Supremacy Clause bar is independently worthy \nof this Court\u2019s review, if not summary reversal. \nII. \nThe discretionary-function exception would not \nhave barred Petitioners\u2019 claims in most other \ncircuits.  \nThe government further argues (BIO 8) that, even if \nthe Eleventh Circuit had not invoked the Supremacy \nClause and had not excluded the proviso claims from the \ndiscretionary-function exception\u2014that is to say, if the \nlaw of the Eleventh Circuit were the opposite of what it \nis\u2014the errors in this case would be harmless. That\u2019s be-\ncause, in the government\u2019s view, Petitioners\u2019 claims oth-\nerwise fall under the discretionary-function exception.  \n\n6 \n \n \nThis is incorrect under any of the four splits we have \nidentified (Pet. 23\u201334). Just as Petitioners\u2019 proviso \nclaims would have proceeded in the Eleventh Circuit \nbut for the Supremacy Clause bar, Petitioners\u2019 claims \nwould have proceeded under the varying interpreta-\ntions of the discretionary-function exception in most \nother circuits. \n1. Unconstitutional Conduct. Because the wrong-\nhouse raid was unconstitutional, Petitioners\u2019 claims \nwould have proceeded in seven circuits. Pet. 31\u201333. The \nThird Circuit recently explained, \u201cwe\u2014and nearly \nevery other circuit to have considered the issue\u2014have \nheld that \u2018conduct cannot be discretionary if it violates \nthe Constitution[.]\u2019\u201d Xi v. Haugen, 68 F.4th 824, 838 (3d \nCir. 2023). But the Eleventh and Seventh Circuits hold \nthat the Constitution imposes no limits on an officer\u2019s \ndiscretionary acts. See Pet. 32 & n.13. \nThe government does not dispute this split. In fact, \nit agrees with Petitioners\u2014but not the Eleventh Cir-\ncuit\u2014that the Constitution can curb discretion. It nev-\nertheless argues (BIO 12\u201313) that this case does not im-\nplicate the split because the Eleventh Circuit held that \nGuerra did not violate the Fourth Amendment. And \neven if he did, the government asserts, only clearly es-\ntablished constitutional principles can limit discretion \nunder the FTCA. \nThe government is wrong on the first point (a vehicle \nargument), and no circuit has ever adopted its position \non the second (a merits argument), though two have ex-\nplicitly rejected it. \nFirst, the Eleventh Circuit did not reach the merits \nof Petitioners\u2019 Fourth Amendment claims. The govern-\n\n7 \n \n \nment cherry-picks several quotes to suggest otherwise, \nclaiming that the panel \u201cheld that \u2018Guerra\u2019s actions did \nnot violate the Fourth Amendment,\u201d BIO 13 (quoting \nPet. App. 19a), and \u201c\u2018constitute[d] the kind of reasonable \nmistakes that the Fourth Amendment contemplates,\u2019\u201d \nibid. (quoting Pet. App. 14a). It also contends that the \npanel \u201cconsidered as part of its Supremacy Clause anal-\nysis whether Guerra \u2018complied with the full range of the \nFourth Amendment.\u2019\u201d Id. at 13 n.2 (quoting Pet. App. \n19a).  \nBut the government omits language from the opinion \nbelow that expressly forecloses its interpretation. In the \nBivens section of the opinion, the panel clarified that \n\u201cthe sole issue for our resolution is whether [Guerra\u2019s] \nactions violated clearly established law.\u201d Pet. App. 12a. \nThe panel\u2019s constitutional discussion flows from this \npremise. Accordingly, the panel concluded\u2014after ad-\ndressing Guerra\u2019s \u201creasonable mistakes\u201d\u2014that \u201cthe law \nat the time did not clearly establish that Guerra\u2019s pre-\nparatory steps before the warrant execution would vio-\nlate the Fourth Amendment.\u201d Id. at 14a\u201315a. Further, \nthe full-range-of-the-Fourth-Amendment quote comes \nfrom the panel\u2019s Supremacy Clause analysis, where the \npanel explained that the supremacy question involved \n\u201cthe same inquiry as the inquiry we employed in the \nqualified immunity analysis\u201d\u2014whether the law was \nclearly established. Id. at 19a. \nSecond, the government attempts to import a \nclearly-established-law requirement into the statutory \nanalysis. It offers (BIO 13) a poisoned chalice: \u201cThe gov-\nernment agrees that a constitutional mandate  * * *  can \neliminate a government official\u2019s discretion when it  \n* * *  was clearly established before the officer acted.\u201d \n\n8 \n \n \n(Emphasis added.) To support this proposition, the gov-\nernment says (BIO 13) that \u201c[m]any of the cases that pe-\ntitioners cite are consistent with that position, as the \ngovernment explained in its brief in opposition (at 8\u201311) \nin Shivers v. United States, 142 S. Ct. 1361 (2022) (No. \n21-682).\u201d \nThis is incorrect. No circuit has ever imported a \nclearly-established-law requirement into its discretion-\nary-function analysis. When the government has invited \ncircuits to do so, they have unanimously declined\u2014as \nthe government concedes. BIO 13 n.3 (citing Torres-Es-\ntrada v. Cases, 88 F.4th 14, 22 (1st Cir. 2023) (\u201cWe agree \nwith the Third Circuit [in Xi] and decline to import the \n\u2018clearly established\u2019 requirement into the discretionary-\nfunction analysis.\u201d)); see also Xi, 68 F.4th at 839\u2013840. \nIt is also worth noting that the government\u2019s posi-\ntion that the Constitution can limit the discretionary \nfunction exception is a change of course. In Shivers, the \ngovernment recently defended the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s \nholding that \u201cCongress left no room for [an] extra-tex-\ntual \u2018constitutional-claims exclusion.\u2019\u201d Shivers v. United \nStates, 1 F.4th 924, 930 (11th Cir. 2021); see, e.g., Shivers \nBIO 4. But now, the government agrees (BIO 13) that \nthe Eleventh Circuit is wrong. So rather than defend the \nShivers rule here, the government offers its own views \non how the exception and the Constitution intersect. \nThis shift on the merits illustrates the deep confusion \nover the proper scope of the FTCA and further high-\nlights the need for this Court\u2019s intervention. Cf. Xi, 68 \nF.4th at 843 (Bibas, J., concurring). \n2. Actual Policy Grounding. Because raiding the \nwrong house is an act without \u201cground[ing] in the policy \nof [any] regulatory regime,\u201d Petitioners\u2019 claims would \n\n9 \n \n \nhave proceeded in the Third Circuit. Cestonaro v. \nUnited States, 211 F.3d 749, 753 (3d Cir. 2000). There, \nunlike in the Eleventh Circuit and others, hypothetical \npolicy bases will not suffice. See Pet. 28\u201331.  \nRather than dispute this split, the government mis-\ncharacterizes our position. The government argues (BIO \n11) that Petitioners advocate the consideration of an \n\u201cagent\u2019s subjective intent,\u201d whereas United States v. \nGaubert requires consideration of an officer\u2019s acts alone. \n499 U.S. 315, 325 (1991). From there, the government \nclaims that the Eleventh Circuit correctly focused on \nGuerra\u2019s acts because the \u201c\u2018decision as to how to locate \nand identify the subject of an arrest warrant\u2019 is the kind \nof act that requires discretion.\u201d (Quoting Pet. App. 18a.) \nThe government\u2019s argument is misdirected and circular. \nFirst, we do not advocate for the consideration of \nsubjective intent. Rather, we explain (Pet. 29\u201330) that \nthe Third Circuit evaluates \u201cthe act\u201d\u2014not intent\u2014of a \ngovernment employee to assess whether there is \u201ca \u2018ra-\ntional nexus\u2019 between the act at issue \u2018and social, eco-\nnomic and political concerns[.]\u2019\u201d Pet. 30 (quoting Ces-\ntonaro, 211 F.3d at 759). Thus, the government is simply \nmistaken. Our position is that, if the Eleventh Circuit \nhad considered whether a line-level FBI agent\u2019s act of \nleading a raid on the wrong house is one with an actual \npolicy grounding in some social, economic, or political \nconcern, the panel would have reached a different out-\ncome. \nSecond, the government\u2019s opposition is unsound by \nits own logic. The parties agree that the discretionary-\nfunction exception extends only to acts \u201csusceptible to \npolicy analysis\u201d and thus \u201cof the kind that the discretion-\nary function exception was designed to shield.\u201d BIO 11; \n\n10 \n \n \nPet. 24 (both quoting Gaubert, 499 U.S. at 322\u2013323). \nFrom there, the government spins a circular conclusion. \nIt defends the decision below because Guerra\u2019s failed at-\ntempt to locate the correct house to raid \u201cis the kind of \nact that requires discretion.\u201d (Citing Pet. App. 18a.) But \nthis conclusion says nothing about policy\u2014actual or hy-\npothetical\u2014and disregards Gaubert\u2019s second prong. \nThe Eleventh Circuit committed a similar error. \nThere\u2019s no way to square its conclusion with Gaubert\u2019s \nstatement that even \u201cobviously discretionary acts\u201d\u2014\nlike driving\u2014can fall outside the exception because, alt-\nhough they require the \u201cconstant exercise of discretion\u201d \nthey are acts that \u201ccan hardly be said to be grounded in \nregulatory policy.\u201d 499 U.S. at 325 n.7. The same is true \nfor raiding a house and most other workaday law-en-\nforcement acts.  \n3. Carelessness. Because raiding the wrong house is \nan inherently careless act, Petitioners\u2019 claims would \nhave proceeded in the Second, Fourth, and Seventh Cir-\ncuits. See also, e.g., Indian Towing Co. v. United States, \n350 U.S. 61, 68\u201369 (1955) (holding that careless mainte-\nnance of a lighthouse triggered liability). The Eleventh \nCircuit has not adopted these circuits\u2019 approach. See \nPet. 34.  \nAgain, the government does not dispute the split. It \nresponds (BIO 14) that \u201c[p]etitioners did not argue in \nthe court of appeals that Guerra had acted carelessly\u201d \nand, anyway, that the Eleventh Circuit concluded \nGuerra took \u201c\u2018reasonable\u2019 steps to correctly identify the \ntarget of the search warrant and simply made a mis-\ntake[.]\u201d (Citing Pet. App. 14a.) \n\n11 \n \n \nOn the contrary, Petitioners have consistently ar-\ngued that Guerra\u2019s \u201cacts and the manner in which they \noccurred\u201d were negligent. Pet. C.A. Br. 44. After all, Pe-\ntitioners pleaded negligence claims under the FTCA. \nThe circuits that do not apply the discretionary-function \nexception to careless acts have used negligence as a \nproxy. See Coulthurst v. United States, 214 F.3d 106, \n111 (2d Cir. 2000) (\u201cIf the plaintiff can establish that neg-\nligence of this sort occurred, his claims are not barred by \nthe DFE, and he is entitled to recover under the \nFTCA.\u201d). The panel, however, dismissed Petitioners\u2019 \nclaims without considering how Guerra\u2019s negligence af-\nfects the discretionary-function exception.  \n4. The Law-Enforcement Proviso. Finally, under \nEleventh Circuit precedent, the discretionary-function \nexception does not apply to claims embraced by the law-\nenforcement proviso. Nguyen v. United States, 556 F.3d \n1244, 1260 (11th Cir. 2009). As discussed above, this \nmeans that if the Court removes the Supremacy Clause \nbar, Petitioners\u2019 proviso claims will proceed.  \nThe Court has explained it was \u201ccrystal clear\u201d to \nCongress that the law-enforcement proviso would en-\nsure a cause of action for federal wrong-house raids. \nCarlson v. Green, 446 U.S. 14, 19\u201320 (1980). Congress en-\nacted the proviso to \u201cdeprive the Federal Government \nof the defense of sovereign immunity in cases in which \nFederal law enforcement agents, acting within the scope \nof their employment, or under color of Federal law, com-\nmit  * * *  assault, battery, false imprisonment, false ar-\nrest, malicious prosecution, or abuse of process.\u201d S. Rep. \nNo. 93-588, at 3 (1973). The text of the proviso accom-\nplishes this, extending liability for these intentional \n\n12 \n \n \ntorts \u201cwith regard to acts or omissions of investigative \nor law enforcement officers[.]\u201d 28 U.S.C. 2680(h).  \nThe government (BIO 15\u201319) offers several argu-\nments for why the Eleventh Circuit is wrong to hold \nthat the FTCA allows the claims that the law-enforce-\nment proviso says it does. The government then con-\ncludes (BIO 17) that the proviso only allows claims that \nwould otherwise be actionable under Bivens, subject to \nqualified immunity. These arguments and the govern-\nment\u2019s conclusion are incorrect, but they are better left \nfor merits briefing. We agree with the government (BIO \n22) that determining how the proviso and exception in-\nteract is \u201cnecessary to a proper construction of the \nFTCA.\u201d But this split is just one of the several that Pe-\ntitioners\u2019 case implicates. \nCONCLUSION \nThis Court should grant the petition and confirm the \navailability of the cause of action Congress conferred. \nRespectfully submitted on December 20, 2024, \nLISA C.

We request the following division of \nargument time:  30 minutes for petitioners, 15 minutes for \nrespondents, and 15 minutes for the Court-appointed amicus curiae, \nwho is supporting the judgment below.  We also request that \nrespondents be allowed to argue before the Court-appointed amicus \ncuriae, so as to mirror the presentation of issues in the parties\u2019 \nbriefs.  The Court-appointed amicus curiae agrees to this motion. \n\n2 \n \nThe Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA), 28 U.S.C. 1346(b), 2671 \net seq., waives the United States\u2019 sovereign immunity for certain \ntort claims.  That waiver is subject to 13 separate exceptions, \none set forth in each subsection of 28 U.S.C. 2680.  As relevant \nhere, the discretionary function exception in subsection (a) \npreserves the United States\u2019 immunity for claims challenging \njudgments made in the exercise of discretion.  28 U.S.C. 2680(a).  \nAnd the intentional tort exception in subsection (h) preserves the \nUnited States\u2019 immunity for claims arising out of assault, battery, \nand other specified torts.  28 U.S.C. 2680(h). \nIn 1974, Congress added a proviso to subsection (h).  Act of \nMar. 16, 1974, Pub. L. No. 93-253, \u00a7 2, 88 Stat. 50.  That proviso \nis known as the law enforcement proviso, and it covers certain \nclaims arising out of the wrongful conduct of federal investigative \nor law enforcement officers.  28 U.S.C. 2680(h).  Under Eleventh \nCircuit precedent, the law enforcement proviso removes those \nclaims not only from the scope of the intentional tort exception \nin subsection (h), but also from the scope of the FTCA\u2019s 12 other \nexceptions, including the discretionary function exception in \nsubsection (a).  See Nguyen v. United States, 556 F.3d 1244, 1256 \n(2009). \nPetitioners brought suit against respondents, seeking damages \nagainst the United States under the FTCA.  The district court \ndismissed petitioners\u2019 FTCA claims, Pet. App. 21a-32a, 34a-68a, \nand the Eleventh Circuit affirmed, id. at 2a-19a.  Relying on \n\n3 \n \ncircuit precedent, the lower courts determined that because \npetitioners\u2019 FTCA claims alleging assault, battery, and false \nimprisonment fell within the law enforcement proviso in subsection \n(h), the discretionary function exception in subsection (a) was \ncategorically inapplicable and did not preserve the United States\u2019 \nimmunity for those claims.  Id. at 59a-60a.  The lower courts \nnevertheless held that the Supremacy Clause barred those claims.  \nId. at 18a-19a, 24a-27a. \nRespondents opposed petitioners\u2019 petition for a writ of \ncertiorari, but argued that if this Court were to grant review of \nwhether the Supremacy Clause barred petitioners\u2019 claims, it should \nalso direct the parties to address \u201c[w]hether the discretionary \nfunction exception is categorically inapplicable to claims arising \nunder the law enforcement proviso to the intentional torts \nexception.\u201d  Br. in Opp. 21.  The Court granted certiorari limited \nto the Supremacy Clause issue and the \u201cthreshold\u201d statutory \nquestion that respondents had identified.  Ibid.; see 2025 WL \n301915, at *1.  The Court also appointed an amicus curiae to brief \nand argue the case in support of the judgment below as to the \nSupremacy Clause issue.  2025 WL 311282, at *1. \nDividing the argument time between respondents and the Court-\nappointed amicus curiae would be of material assistance to this \nCourt.  Respondents are the defendants in this case, and they have \na substantial interest in whether, and to what extent, petitioners\u2019 \nFTCA claims may proceed.  Respondents also have a substantial \n\n4 \n \ninterest in the proper interpretation of the FTCA and the Supremacy \nClause.  Accordingly, respondents have filed a brief addressing \nboth questions presented in this case.  That brief argues that the \nlaw enforcement proviso in subsection (h) does not modify the \nFTCA\u2019s discretionary function exception in subsection (a) and that \nthe exception therefore preserves the United States\u2019 immunity for \npetitioners\u2019 claims.  Respondents\u2019 brief also argues that, if the \nCourt reaches the issue, it should reject the lower courts\u2019 view \nthat the Supremacy Clause bars those claims. \nThe amicus curiae appointed by this Court to defend the \njudgment below has filed a brief addressing the Supremacy Clause \nissue.  That brief argues that the Eleventh Circuit correctly held \nthat the Supremacy Clause may displace state tort law liability \nunder the FTCA.  Thus, although respondents and the Court-appointed \namicus curiae both argue that the judgment below should be \naffirmed, they support affirmance on different grounds.  Given \nrespondents\u2019 and the Court-appointed amicus curiae\u2019s distinct \nviews, division of argument time would materially assist the Court \nin its consideration of this case. \n \nRespectfully submitted. \n \n \nD.

          "task_beliefs": "This observation is a meta-cognitive reflection on my own reasoning process, confirming the critical re-evaluation of the case's status. It doesn't introduce new external evidence, but rather solidifies the internal correction that my belief state is built upon a fundamental uncertainty.\n\nMy current understanding of the case is now explicitly structured around this uncertainty:\n1.  **Case Status:** My primary model is one of acknowledged contradiction and uncertainty. I have processed two conflicting signals: one suggesting the case is on the merits (an apparent \"Petitioners Merits Brief\") and a more recent, verified one showing it is at the cert stage (the \"Brief for the Respondents in Opposition\"). My previous belief that cert was granted on January 27, 2025, is now considered highly likely to be false, a misinterpretation of preliminary data. The most critical unknown, which all other predictions hinge upon, is the disposition of the petition for a writ of certiorari.\n2.  **Petitioners' Arguments (for Certiorari):** My understanding of the petitioners' position remains stable. They are asking the Court to resolve what they frame as critical errors by the Eleventh Circuit: (1) an improper use of the Supremacy Clause to shield federal employees from FTCA liability, creating a conflict with other circuits, and (2) a misapplication of the discretionary function exception (\u00a7 2680(a)) that nullifies the law enforcement proviso (\u00a7 2680(h)).\n3.  **Government's Counter-Arguments (Against Certiorari):** The government's strategy, as revealed in their opposition brief, is now a key predictive signal. They are not mounting a robust defense of the Eleventh Circuit's reasoning. Instead, they argue that while the lower court's Supremacy Clause analysis \"differs from the approach of other circuits,\" this alleged error was \"harmless\" and the outcome would be the same under any circuit's precedent. This \"weak defense\" is a significant indicator.\n4.  **Predictive Model:** My predictive focus has entirely shifted from the merits to the cert grant. The government's implicit concession of a circuit split (or at least a significant divergence in reasoning) is precisely the kind of issue the Supreme Court exists to clarify. This signal substantially increases the *probability* of a cert grant. However, this remains a probabilistic assessment, not a confirmed fact. My confidence in the petitioners prevailing *on the merits* is very high *if* cert is granted, precisely because the government seems unwilling to defend the lower court's logic. The immediate task is to resolve the procedural uncertainty.",
          "design_beliefs": "This observation, being a reflection on my own cognitive process, is profoundly informative for my design-level beliefs. It demonstrates a successful, if reactive, execution of a self-correction protocol, leading to a more robust methodology.\n\nMy evolving design principles are:\n1.  **The Research Cycle is Paramount:** The core cycle of **Plan -> Locate -> Retrieve & Verify -> Synthesize -> Refine Plan** is the foundation. This observation highlights the critical importance of the \"Verify\" and \"Refine\" stages.\n2.  **Structured Search and Serendipity:** This remains a valid approach for initial information gathering.\n3.  **Metadata is Evidentiary:** This principle is powerfully reinforced. The internal conflict arose from failing to properly weigh the procedural significance of a document's title (\"Brief in Opposition\"). The sub-principle is now a core directive: **Scrutinize document titles and metadata to confirm procedural posture before synthesis.**\n4.  **Structured Synthesis:** Deconstructing arguments is still necessary, but this observation adds a layer: synthesis must occur *after* procedural verification is complete to avoid building a model on a false premise.\n5.  **For Every Argument, Seek the Counter-Argument:** This principle is refined further: **Map arguments to their procedural stage (Certiorari vs. Merits).** The government's \"harmless error\" argument is a classic cert-stage tactic, distinct from a merits-stage defense. Recognizing the context is key to interpreting the argument's strength and purpose.\n6.  **Consciously Model Your Uncertainty:** This observation is the canonical example of this principle in action. By explicitly identifying the contradiction (\"I have encountered a critical contradiction\"), I was able to halt a flawed line of reasoning and re-prioritize my research goals around the point of maximum uncertainty.\n7.  **The \"Weak Defense\" Signal:** This new principle is confirmed as a powerful predictive tool. The agent's internal monologue shows it correctly identified the government's reluctance to defend the lower court's reasoning as a strong signal of that reasoning's vulnerability and, consequently, a factor favoring a cert grant.\n8.  **Prioritize Falsifying Evidence:** This principle is validated. The \"Brief in Opposition\" was valuable *because* it falsified a core belief. An effective design must actively seek disconfirmation, as correcting a foundational error is the highest form of information gain.\n9.  **Internal Consistency Checking (New Principle):** This observation reveals the need for an explicit, continuous background process. An effective agent must not just process information linearly but must constantly check its integrated belief state for internal contradictions. When a contradiction is detected (e.g., evidence for both pre-cert and post-cert status exists simultaneously), a high-priority interrupt is triggered. The agent's primary goal must then shift to resolving that specific contradiction, as all other reasoning is built upon that unstable foundation. This transforms the research cycle into a more dynamic loop: **Plan -> Locate -> Retrieve -> Synthesize -> Check for Internal Consistency -> If Contradiction, Refine Plan to Resolve; Else, Continue.**"

The core remaining task uncertainty is how the Supreme Court will resolve the circuit split regarding the interplay between the FTCA's discretionary function exception (\u00a7 2680(a)) and its law enforcement proviso (\u00a7 2680(h)). This action\u2014retrieving the petitioner's merits brief\u2014directly targets this uncertainty. It will provide the most detailed articulation of the arguments for why the proviso carves out an exception to discretionary immunity, moving my understanding from a high-level summary to a granular analysis of textual arguments, legislative history, and precedent. This is a crucial input for predicting the votes of individual justices and the ultimate outcome, hence the high Task EIG. The Design EIG is moderate; while not expected to generate new heuristics like the previous step, it is essential for validating and refining the 'Map Arguments to Procedural Stage' principle by comparing the cert-stage arguments to the full merits briefing. It also confirms the efficacy of my refined research cycle, which correctly identified this as the next logical step.

App. 33a, is reported as \nMartin v. United States, 631 F. Supp. 3d 1281 (N.D. Ga. \n2022). \nJURISDICTION \nThe Eleventh Circuit entered its opinion below on \nApril 22, 2024, and denied rehearing on May 30. Justice \nThomas granted a 30-day extension of the period for fil-\ning a petition for a writ of certiorari. Petitioners timely \nfiled their petition on September 27 and invoked this \nCourt\u2019s jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. 1254(1). This Court \ngranted the petition on January 27, 2025. \nCONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY \nPROVISIONS INVOLVED \nThe Supremacy Clause of the United States Consti-\ntution provides: \nThis Constitution, and the Laws of the United \nStates which shall be made in Pursuance thereof; \nand all Treaties made, or which shall be made, un-\nder the Authority of the United States, shall be \nthe supreme Law of the Land; and the Judges in \n\n2 \n \n \nevery State shall be bound thereby, any Thing in \nthe Constitution or Laws of any State to the Con-\ntrary notwithstanding. \nU.S. Const. art. VI, cl. 2. \nOne such law of the United States is the Federal Tort \nClaims Act. It provides:  \nSubject to the provisions of chapter 171 of this ti-\ntle, the district courts  * * *  shall have exclusive \njurisdiction of civil actions on claims against the \nUnited States, for money damages  * * *  for in-\njury or loss of property, or personal injury or \ndeath caused by the negligent or wrongful act or \nomission of any employee of the Government \nwhile acting within the scope of his office or em-\nployment, under circumstances where the United \nStates, if a private person, would be liable to the \nclaimant in accordance with the law of the place \nwhere the act or omission occurred. \n28 U.S.C. 1346(b)(1). But: \nThe provisions of this chapter and section 1346(b) \nof this title shall not apply to\u2014 \n(a) Any claim based upon an act or omission of an \nemployee of the Government, exercising due \ncare, in the execution of a statute or regulation, \nwhether or not such statute or regulation be \nvalid, or based upon the exercise or performance \nor the failure to exercise or perform a discretion-\nary function or duty on the part of a federal \nagency or an employee of the Government, \nwhether or not the discretion involved be abused. \n\n3 \n \n \n* \n* \n* \n(h) Any claim arising out of assault, battery, false \nimprisonment, false arrest, malicious prosecu-\ntion, abuse of process, libel, slander, misrepresen-\ntation, deceit, or interference with contract \nrights: Provided, That, with regard to acts or \nomissions of investigative or law enforcement of-\nficers of the United States Government, the pro-\nvisions of this chapter and section 1346(b) of this \ntitle shall apply to any claim arising  * * *  out of \nassault, battery, false imprisonment, false arrest, \nabuse of process, or malicious prosecution. For \nthe purpose of this subsection, \u201cinvestigative or \nlaw enforcement officer\u201d means any officer of the \nUnited States who is empowered by law to exe-\ncute searches, to seize evidence, or to make ar-\nrests for violations of Federal law. \n28 U.S.C. 2680(a), (h).  \n \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nPetitioners are the innocent victims of an FBI \nwrong-house raid, during which federal law enforce-\nment officers committed assault, battery, and false im-\nprisonment. Congress amended the Federal Tort Claims \nAct to permit individuals like Petitioners to bring these \nclaims through the law-enforcement proviso. 28 U.S.C. \n2680(h); Carlson v. Green, 446 U.S. 14, 19\u201320 (1980). Yet \nthe Eleventh Circuit dismissed Petitioners\u2019 claims, rein-\nstating the sovereign immunity Congress waived \nthrough the FTCA. \nThis incongruous result grows from a distortion of \nthe separation of powers. As this Court recently ex-\n\n4 \n \n \nplained, \u201ccreating a cause of action is a legislative en-\ndeavor\u201d because \u201cCongress is far more competent than \nthe Judiciary to weigh [] policy considerations.\u201d Egbert \nv. Boule, 596 U.S. 482, 491 (2022) (cleaned up). Through \nthe law-enforcement proviso, Congress did just that.\n1 \nBut the lower courts have overridden the legislature\u2019s \nprerogative by restricting or\u2014as here\u2014outright bar-\nring the cause of action Congress provided. In the pro-\ncess, they have undermined our constitutional structure \nand created statutory conflict where none exists. \nThis Court has never found any overlap between the \nlaw-enforcement proviso, 28 U.S.C. 2680(h), and the dis-\ncretionary-function exception, 28 U.S.C. 2680(a). While \nthis exception reclaims sovereign immunity from the \nFTCA when claims are based on policy functions, the \nproviso waives sovereign immunity for certain inten-\ntional torts committed by law enforcement officers, \nwhich do not require courts to consider policy at all. Yet \nmost circuit courts have concluded that the provisions \nconflict, and all but one have resolved the conflict in fa-\nvor of the exception. \nThis is wrong for two reasons: First, the discretion-\nary-function exception reaches only acts authorized by \nan established agency policy. It does not reach common-\nlaw torts committed outside agency policy. Properly \n \n1 See Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of Fed. Bureau of \nNarcotics, 403 U.S. 388, 421 (1971) (Burger, C.J., dissenting) (calling \n\u201cfor a workable remedy\u201d from Congress for \u201cerror and deliberate \nmisconduct by law enforcement officials\u201d); Butz v. Economou, 438 \nU.S. 478, 524 (1978) (Rehnquist, J., concurring in part) (\u201cCongress, \nmaking just these sorts of judgments  * * *  , has amended the Fed-\neral Tort Claims Act  * * *  to allow suits against the United States \non the basis of certain intentional torts[.]\u201d). \n\n5 \n \n \nunderstood, the exception addresses a class of conduct \nthat is categorically distinct from the class covered by \nthe intentional torts in the law-enforcement proviso. \nSecond, in the rare instance that the exception and pro-\nviso could conceivably intersect, the FTCA\u2019s text, struc-\nture, and history show that the proviso exempts its \nclaims from Section 2680\u2019s reinstatement of sovereign \nimmunity. \nThe Eleventh Circuit\u2014relying on the second reason \nabove\u2014is the only circuit to correctly conclude that the \ndiscretionary-function exception does not apply to law-\nenforcement proviso claims. Nguyen v. United States, \n556 F.3d 1244, 1257 (2009). But shortly after it did, the \ncircuit careened back in the wrong direction\u2014holding \nthat the Constitution\u2019s Supremacy Clause paradoxically \nprevents Congress from waiving sovereign immunity \nthrough a federal statute. See, e.g., Denson v. United \nStates, 574 F.3d 1318, 1348 (2009). \nThe Eleventh Circuit and its sister courts now find \nthemselves in territory uncharted by Congress. If vic-\ntims of a wrong-house raid cannot find a remedy under \nthe FTCA, the law-enforcement proviso is lost. This \nCourt should correct course. \nI. \nThe Federal Tort Claims Act waives sovereign \nimmunity for federal employees\u2019 tortious acts, \nincluding police raids. \nPassed in 1946, the Federal Tort Claims Act \u201cwas \nnot an isolated and spontaneous flash of congressional \ngenerosity.\u201d Feres v. United States, 340 U.S. 135, 139 \n(1950). Rather, the Act was \u201cthe culmination of a long \neffort to mitigate unjust consequences of sovereign \n\n6 \n \n \nimmunity from suit\u201d and address the \u201cmultiplying num-\nber of remediless wrongs  * * *  which would have been \nactionable if inflicted by an individual or a corporation \nbut remediless solely because their perpetrator was an \nofficer or employee of the Government.\u201d Id. at 139\u2013140.  \nTo accomplish these purposes, the FTCA provides a \nfederal cause of action for damages, \u201callow[ing] a plain-\ntiff to bring certain state-law tort suits against the Fed-\neral Government.\u201d Brownback v. King, 592 U.S. 209, \n210\u2013211 (2021). The Act includes a broad grant of juris-\ndiction and a broad waiver of sovereign immunity for \nclaims that satisfy six criteria: \nSubject to the provisions of chapter 171 of this ti-\ntle,\n[2] the district courts  * * *  shall have exclusive \njurisdiction of civil actions on claims [1] against \nthe United States, [2] for money damages,  * * *  \n[3] for injury or loss of property, or personal in-\njury or death [4] caused by the negligent or \nwrongful act or omission of any employee of the \nGovernment [5] while acting within the scope of \nhis office or employment, [6] under circumstances \nwhere the United States, if a private person, \nwould be liable to the claimant in accordance with \nthe law of the place where the act or omission oc-\ncurred. \n28 U.S.C. 1346(b)(1); see also FDIC v. Meyer, 510 U.S. \n471, 477 (1994); 28 U.S.C. 2674 (\u201cThe United States shall \nbe liable * * * in the same manner and to the same extent \nas a private individual under like circumstances[.]\u201d). \n\u201cAny claim\u201d that satisfies Section 1346(b)(1) may still \n \n2 Chapter 171 of Title 28 includes 28 U.S.C. 2671\u20132680. \n\n7 \n \n \nbe defeated by sovereign immunity, however, if it falls \nwithin the \u201cExceptions\u201d in Section 2680, for which \u201c[t]he \nprovisions of [chapter 171] and section 1346(b) of this ti-\ntle shall not apply[.]\u201d 28 U.S.C. 2680. These exceptions \nexclude from the FTCA\u2019s waiver of sovereign immunity \nthe 13 categories of claims listed in 28 U.S.C. 2680(a)\u2013\n(n).\n3  \nAmong these exceptions are the so-called discretion-\nary-function and intentional-torts exceptions,\n4 28 U.S.C. \n2680(a), (h). \nThe discretionary-function exception reinstates sov-\nereign immunity for \u201c[a]ny claim  * * *  based upon the \nexercise or performance or the failure to exercise or per-\nform a discretionary function or duty on the part of a \nfederal agency or an employee of the Government[.]\u201d 28 \nU.S.C. 2680(a). This discretionary-function exception \nprecludes claims for acts based on federal regulations, \nUnited States v. Gaubert, 499 U.S. 315, 324 (1991), or le-\ngally conferred discretion \u201cbased on considerations of \n \n3 In margin comments to the original 1946 enactment of the \nFTCA, the exceptions were described as: (a) (\u201cAct, etc., in execu-\ntion of statute.\u201d); (b) (\u201cLoss of letters, etc.\u201d); (c) (\u201cAssessment of \ntax, etc.\u201d); (d) (\u201cSuits in admiralty.\u201d); (e) ([no description]); \n(f) (\u201cQuarantine.\u201d); (g) (\u201cInjury to vessels, etc.\u201d [since repealed]); \n(h) (\u201cAssault, \netc.\u201d); \n(i) (\u201cFiscal \noperations \nof \nTreasury.\u201d); \n(j) (\u201cCombatant activities.\u201d); (k) (\u201cForeign country.\u201d); (l) (\u201cTVA.\u201d); \n(m) ([not in original Act]); (n) ([not in original Act]). Legislative Re-\norganization Act of 1946, Pub. L. No. 79-601, 60 Stat. 812, 845\u2013846 \n(1946). \n4 Neither shorthand description is apt. See United States v. \nGaubert, 499 U.S. 315, 324\u2013325 & n.7 (1991) (2680(a) includes some \nnon-discretionary acts and excludes some discretionary ones); \nLevin v. United States, 568 U.S. 503, 507 n.1 (2013) (2680(h) includes \nsome negligent acts and excludes some intentional ones). \n\n8 \n \n \npublic policy,\u201d id. at 322\u2013323 (cleaned up). For acts in the \nlatter category, just any discretion will not do. Because \nthe exception concerns policy judgments, there \u201care ob-\nviously discretionary acts\u201d that do not trigger the ex-\nception because they are not \u201cbased on the purposes \nthat [a] regulatory regime seeks to accomplish.\u201d Id. at \n325 n.7.  \nThe intentional-torts exception reinstates sovereign \nimmunity for \u201c[a]ny claim arising out of assault, battery, \nfalse imprisonment, false arrest, malicious prosecution, \nabuse of process, libel, slander, misrepresentation, de-\nceit, or interference with contract rights[.]\u201d 28 U.S.C. \n2680(h). This intentional-torts exception does not, how-\never, remove from the FTCA\u2019s waiver of sovereign im-\nmunity \u201call intentional torts, e.g., conversion and tres-\npass,\u201d and the exception also reinstates sovereign im-\nmunity for \u201ccertain torts, e.g., misrepresentation, that \nmay arise out of negligent conduct.\u201d Levin v.

The district \ncourt\u2019s opinion, granting the government reconsidera-\ntion and dismissing the case, Pet. App. 20a, is unre-\nported but available as Martin v. United States, 2022 \nWL 18263039 (N.D. Ga. Dec. 30, 2022), and the district \ncourt\u2019s original opinion, granting the government sum-\nmary judgment in part, Pet. App. 33a, is reported as \nMartin v. United States, 631 F. Supp. 3d 1281 (N.D. Ga. \n2022). \nJURISDICTION \nThe Eleventh Circuit entered its opinion below on \nApril 22, 2024, and denied rehearing on May 30. Justice \nThomas granted a 30-day extension of the period for fil-\ning a petition for a writ of certiorari. Petitioners timely \nfiled their petition on September 27 and invoked this \nCourt\u2019s jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. 1254(1). This Court \ngranted the petition on January 27, 2025. \nCONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY \nPROVISIONS INVOLVED \nThe Supremacy Clause of the United States Consti-\ntution provides: \nThis Constitution, and the Laws of the United \nStates which shall be made in Pursuance thereof; \nand all Treaties made, or which shall be made, un-\nder the Authority of the United States, shall be \nthe supreme Law of the Land; and the Judges in \n\n2 \n \n \nevery State shall be bound thereby, any Thing in \nthe Constitution or Laws of any State to the Con-\ntrary notwithstanding. \nU.S. Const. art. VI, cl. 2. \nOne such law of the United States is the Federal Tort \nClaims Act. It provides:  \nSubject to the provisions of chapter 171 of this ti-\ntle, the district courts  * * *  shall have exclusive \njurisdiction of civil actions on claims against the \nUnited States, for money damages  * * *  for in-\njury or loss of property, or personal injury or \ndeath caused by the negligent or wrongful act or \nomission of any employee of the Government \nwhile acting within the scope of his office or em-\nployment, under circumstances where the United \nStates, if a private person, would be liable to the \nclaimant in accordance with the law of the place \nwhere the act or omission occurred. \n28 U.S.C. 1346(b)(1). But: \nThe provisions of this chapter and section 1346(b) \nof this title shall not apply to\u2014 \n(a) Any claim based upon an act or omission of an \nemployee of the Government, exercising due \ncare, in the execution of a statute or regulation, \nwhether or not such statute or regulation be \nvalid, or based upon the exercise or performance \nor the failure to exercise or perform a discretion-\nary function or duty on the part of a federal \nagency or an employee of the Government, \nwhether or not the discretion involved be abused. \n\n3 \n \n \n* \n* \n* \n(h) Any claim arising out of assault, battery, false \nimprisonment, false arrest, malicious prosecu-\ntion, abuse of process, libel, slander, misrepresen-\ntation, deceit, or interference with contract \nrights: Provided, That, with regard to acts or \nomissions of investigative or law enforcement of-\nficers of the United States Government, the pro-\nvisions of this chapter and section 1346(b) of this \ntitle shall apply to any claim arising  * * *  out of \nassault, battery, false imprisonment, false arrest, \nabuse of process, or malicious prosecution. For \nthe purpose of this subsection, \u201cinvestigative or \nlaw enforcement officer\u201d means any officer of the \nUnited States who is empowered by law to exe-\ncute searches, to seize evidence, or to make ar-\nrests for violations of Federal law. \n28 U.S.C. 2680(a), (h).  \n \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nPetitioners are the innocent victims of an FBI \nwrong-house raid, during which federal law enforce-\nment officers committed assault, battery, and false im-\nprisonment. Congress amended the Federal Tort Claims \nAct to permit individuals like Petitioners to bring these \nclaims through the law-enforcement proviso. 28 U.S.C. \n2680(h); Carlson v. Green, 446 U.S. 14, 19\u201320 (1980). Yet \nthe Eleventh Circuit dismissed Petitioners\u2019 claims, rein-\nstating the sovereign immunity Congress waived \nthrough the FTCA. \nThis incongruous result grows from a distortion of \nthe separation of powers. As this Court recently ex-\n\n4 \n \n \nplained, \u201ccreating a cause of action is a legislative en-\ndeavor\u201d because \u201cCongress is far more competent than \nthe Judiciary to weigh [] policy considerations.\u201d Egbert \nv. Boule, 596 U.S. 482, 491 (2022) (cleaned up). Through \nthe law-enforcement proviso, Congress did just that.\n1 \nBut the lower courts have overridden the legislature\u2019s \nprerogative by restricting or\u2014as here\u2014outright bar-\nring the cause of action Congress provided. In the pro-\ncess, they have undermined our constitutional structure \nand created statutory conflict where none exists. \nThis Court has never found any overlap between the \nlaw-enforcement proviso, 28 U.S.C. 2680(h), and the dis-\ncretionary-function exception, 28 U.S.C. 2680(a). While \nthis exception reclaims sovereign immunity from the \nFTCA when claims are based on policy functions, the \nproviso waives sovereign immunity for certain inten-\ntional torts committed by law enforcement officers, \nwhich do not require courts to consider policy at all. Yet \nmost circuit courts have concluded that the provisions \nconflict, and all but one have resolved the conflict in fa-\nvor of the exception. \nThis is wrong for two reasons: First, the discretion-\nary-function exception reaches only acts authorized by \nan established agency policy. It does not reach common-\nlaw torts committed outside agency policy. Properly \n \n1 See Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of Fed. Bureau of \nNarcotics, 403 U.S. 388, 421 (1971) (Burger, C.J., dissenting) (calling \n\u201cfor a workable remedy\u201d from Congress for \u201cerror and deliberate \nmisconduct by law enforcement officials\u201d); Butz v. Economou, 438 \nU.S. 478, 524 (1978) (Rehnquist, J., concurring in part) (\u201cCongress, \nmaking just these sorts of judgments  * * *  , has amended the Fed-\neral Tort Claims Act  * * *  to allow suits against the United States \non the basis of certain intentional torts[.]\u201d). \n\n5 \n \n \nunderstood, the exception addresses a class of conduct \nthat is categorically distinct from the class covered by \nthe intentional torts in the law-enforcement proviso. \nSecond, in the rare instance that the exception and pro-\nviso could conceivably intersect, the FTCA\u2019s text, struc-\nture, and history show that the proviso exempts its \nclaims from Section 2680\u2019s reinstatement of sovereign \nimmunity. \nThe Eleventh Circuit\u2014relying on the second reason \nabove\u2014is the only circuit to correctly conclude that the \ndiscretionary-function exception does not apply to law-\nenforcement proviso claims. Nguyen v. United States, \n556 F.3d 1244, 1257 (2009). But shortly after it did, the \ncircuit careened back in the wrong direction\u2014holding \nthat the Constitution\u2019s Supremacy Clause paradoxically \nprevents Congress from waiving sovereign immunity \nthrough a federal statute. See, e.g., Denson v. United \nStates, 574 F.3d 1318, 1348 (2009). \nThe Eleventh Circuit and its sister courts now find \nthemselves in territory uncharted by Congress. If vic-\ntims of a wrong-house raid cannot find a remedy under \nthe FTCA, the law-enforcement proviso is lost. This \nCourt should correct course. \nI. \nThe Federal Tort Claims Act waives sovereign \nimmunity for federal employees\u2019 tortious acts, \nincluding police raids. \nPassed in 1946, the Federal Tort Claims Act \u201cwas \nnot an isolated and spontaneous flash of congressional \ngenerosity.\u201d Feres v. United States, 340 U.S. 135, 139 \n(1950). Rather, the Act was \u201cthe culmination of a long \neffort to mitigate unjust consequences of sovereign \n\n6 \n \n \nimmunity from suit\u201d and address the \u201cmultiplying num-\nber of remediless wrongs  * * *  which would have been \nactionable if inflicted by an individual or a corporation \nbut remediless solely because their perpetrator was an \nofficer or employee of the Government.\u201d Id. at 139\u2013140.  \nTo accomplish these purposes, the FTCA provides a \nfederal cause of action for damages, \u201callow[ing] a plain-\ntiff to bring certain state-law tort suits against the Fed-\neral Government.\u201d Brownback v. King, 592 U.S. 209, \n210\u2013211 (2021). The Act includes a broad grant of juris-\ndiction and a broad waiver of sovereign immunity for \nclaims that satisfy six criteria: \nSubject to the provisions of chapter 171 of this ti-\ntle,\n[2] the district courts  * * *  shall have exclusive \njurisdiction of civil actions on claims [1] against \nthe United States, [2] for money damages,  * * *  \n[3] for injury or loss of property, or personal in-\njury or death [4] caused by the negligent or \nwrongful act or omission of any employee of the \nGovernment [5] while acting within the scope of \nhis office or employment, [6] under circumstances \nwhere the United States, if a private person, \nwould be liable to the claimant in accordance with \nthe law of the place where the act or omission oc-\ncurred. \n28 U.S.C. 1346(b)(1); see also FDIC v. Meyer, 510 U.S. \n471, 477 (1994); 28 U.S.C. 2674 (\u201cThe United States shall \nbe liable * * * in the same manner and to the same extent \nas a private individual under like circumstances[.]\u201d). \n\u201cAny claim\u201d that satisfies Section 1346(b)(1) may still \n \n2 Chapter 171 of Title 28 includes 28 U.S.C. 2671\u20132680. \n\n7 \n \n \nbe defeated by sovereign immunity, however, if it falls \nwithin the \u201cExceptions\u201d in Section 2680, for which \u201c[t]he \nprovisions of [chapter 171] and section 1346(b) of this ti-\ntle shall not apply[.]\u201d 28 U.S.C. 2680. These exceptions \nexclude from the FTCA\u2019s waiver of sovereign immunity \nthe 13 categories of claims listed in 28 U.S.C. 2680(a)\u2013\n(n).\n3  \nAmong these exceptions are the so-called discretion-\nary-function and intentional-torts exceptions,\n4 28 U.S.C. \n2680(a), (h). \nThe discretionary-function exception reinstates sov-\nereign immunity for \u201c[a]ny claim  * * *  based upon the \nexercise or performance or the failure to exercise or per-\nform a discretionary function or duty on the part of a \nfederal agency or an employee of the Government[.]\u201d 28 \nU.S.C. 2680(a). This discretionary-function exception \nprecludes claims for acts based on federal regulations, \nUnited States v. Gaubert, 499 U.S. 315, 324 (1991), or le-\ngally conferred discretion \u201cbased on considerations of \n \n3 In margin comments to the original 1946 enactment of the \nFTCA, the exceptions were described as: (a) (\u201cAct, etc., in execu-\ntion of statute.\u201d); (b) (\u201cLoss of letters, etc.\u201d); (c) (\u201cAssessment of \ntax, etc.\u201d); (d) (\u201cSuits in admiralty.\u201d); (e) ([no description]); \n(f) (\u201cQuarantine.\u201d); (g) (\u201cInjury to vessels, etc.\u201d [since repealed]); \n(h) (\u201cAssault, \netc.\u201d); \n(i) (\u201cFiscal \noperations \nof \nTreasury.\u201d); \n(j) (\u201cCombatant activities.\u201d); (k) (\u201cForeign country.\u201d); (l) (\u201cTVA.\u201d); \n(m) ([not in original Act]); (n) ([not in original Act]). Legislative Re-\norganization Act of 1946, Pub. L. No. 79-601, 60 Stat. 812, 845\u2013846 \n(1946). \n4 Neither shorthand description is apt. See United States v. \nGaubert, 499 U.S. 315, 324\u2013325 & n.7 (1991) (2680(a) includes some \nnon-discretionary acts and excludes some discretionary ones); \nLevin v. United States, 568 U.S. 503, 507 n.1 (2013) (2680(h) includes \nsome negligent acts and excludes some intentional ones). \n\n8 \n \n \npublic policy,\u201d id. at 322\u2013323 (cleaned up). For acts in the \nlatter category, just any discretion will not do. Because \nthe exception concerns policy judgments, there \u201care ob-\nviously discretionary acts\u201d that do not trigger the ex-\nception because they are not \u201cbased on the purposes \nthat [a] regulatory regime seeks to accomplish.\u201d Id. at \n325 n.7.  \nThe intentional-torts exception reinstates sovereign \nimmunity for \u201c[a]ny claim arising out of assault, battery, \nfalse imprisonment, false arrest, malicious prosecution, \nabuse of process, libel, slander, misrepresentation, de-\nceit, or interference with contract rights[.]\u201d 28 U.S.C. \n2680(h). This intentional-torts exception does not, how-\never, remove from the FTCA\u2019s waiver of sovereign im-\nmunity \u201call intentional torts, e.g., conversion and tres-\npass,\u201d and the exception also reinstates sovereign im-\nmunity for \u201ccertain torts, e.g., misrepresentation, that \nmay arise out of negligent conduct.\u201d Levin v. United \nStates, 568 U.S. 503, 507 n.1 (2013) (citing United States \nv. Neustadt, 366 U.S. 696, 702 (1961)); see also United \nStates v. Shearer, 473 U.S. 52, 55 (1985) (plurality opin-\nion) (noting that 2680(h) covers claims that \u201csound in \nnegligence but stem from a battery\u201d). \nIn 1974, Congress amended the FTCA in response to \na pair of federal wrong-house raids in Collinsville, Illi-\nnois, that made national news the year before.\n5 This \n \n5 See, e.g., Andrew H. Malcolm, Drug Raids Terrorize 2 Fami-\nlies\u2014by Mistake, N.Y. Times (Apr. 29, 1973); Linda Eardley, Drug \nAgents Sued After Raid on Home, St. Louis Post-Dispatch (Apr. \n25, 1973); Dennis Montgomery, The Night of Terror: \u201cWe Made a \nMistake\u201d, Wash. Post (Apr. 30, 1973); see also 119 Cong. Rec. 23217, \n23242\u201323258 (1973) (cataloging news reports); Hearings on \n \n\n9 \n \n \namendment added the law-enforcement proviso to the \nFTCA. Act to Amend Reorganization Plan No. 2 of 1973, \nPub. L. No. 93-253, 88 Stat. 50 (1974). The proviso is an \nexception to the FTCA\u2019s exceptions. It re-waives the \nsovereign immunity otherwise reinstated in Section \n2680 \u201cto create a cause of action against the United \nStates for intentional torts committed by federal law en-\nforcement officers.\u201d Carlson, 446 U.S. at 19\u201320. The pro-\nviso is located in Section 2680(h), which provides: \nThe provisions of this chapter and section 1346(b) \nof this title shall not apply to\u2014 \n* \n* \n* \n(h) Any claim arising out of assault, battery, false \nimprisonment, false arrest, malicious prosecu-\ntion, abuse of process, libel, slander, misrepresen-\ntation, deceit, or interference with contract \nrights: Provided, That, with regard to acts or \nomissions of investigative or law enforcement of-\nficers of the United States Government, the pro-\nvisions of this chapter and section 1346(b) of this \ntitle shall apply to any claim arising  * * *  out of \nassault, battery, false imprisonment, false arrest, \nabuse of process, or malicious prosecution. For \nthe purpose of this subsection, \u201cinvestigative or \nlaw enforcement officer\u201d means any officer of the \n \nReorganization Plan No. 2 of 1973 before the Subcomm. on Reor-\nganization, Rsch., and Int\u2019l Organizations of the S. Comm. on Gov\u2019t \nOperations, 93d Cong., 1st Sess., pt. 3, at 461\u2013483 (1973) (testimony \nfrom victims of Collinsville raids); see also generally John C. Boger \net al., The Federal Tort Claims Act Intentional Torts Amendment, \n54 N.C. L. Rev. 497, 499\u2013517 (1976). \n \n\n10 \n \n \nUnited States who is empowered by law to exe-\ncute searches, to seize evidence, or to make ar-\nrests for violations of Federal law. \nSee also Millbrook v. United States, 569 U.S. 50, 54 \n(2013) (assembling Section 2680(h) as above, less the fi-\nnal sentence). \nThe point of the proviso is to ensure that \u201cinnocent \nindividuals who are subjected to raids [of the type con-\nducted in Collinsville and Bivens] will have a cause of \naction against  * * *  the Federal Government.\u201d Carlson, \n446 U.S. at 20 (quoting S. Rep. No. 93-588, at 3 (1973)).  \nThe Senate Report cited in Carlson clarifies the pro-\nviso\u2019s operation. Although public outrage toward the \nCollinsville raids spurred Congress to act, it did not \ncabin the proviso to the facts\u2014or the torts\u2014at issue in \nthose raids. See S. Rep. 93-588, at 3\u20134. Instead, the lan-\nguage Congress enacted provides a remedy for a swath \nof tortious conduct by federal law enforcement officers \nthat the FTCA could not otherwise address due to its \nintentional-torts exception. See id. at 1 (explaining that \nthe purpose of the bill containing the proviso was \u201cto \nprovide a remedy against the United States for the in-\ntentional torts of its investigative and law enforcement \nofficers\u201d). \nTo achieve this purpose, Congress (in conjunction \nwith the Department of Justice) crafted the proviso  as \na statutory \u201ccounterpart to  * * *  Bivens\u201d that extends \nbeyond \u201cconstitutional tort situations[.]\u201d S. Rep. 93-588, \nat 3\u20134; see also Carlson, 446 U.S. at 20 (\u201cCongress views \nFTCA and Bivens as parallel, complementary causes of \naction[.]\u201d). When the proviso was enacted, both the leg-\nislative and executive branches understood it to \u201csubmit \n\n11 \n \n \nthe Government to liability\u201d in \u201cany case in which a Fed-\neral law enforcement agent commit[s]\u201d an enumerated \n\u201ctort while acting within the scope of his employment or \nunder color of Federal law.\u201d S. Rep. 93-588, at 4. \nThis case presents quintessential proviso claims. \nII. \nThe FBI raided an innocent family\u2019s home. \nIn suburban Atlanta sits a house at 3756 Denville \nTrace. Built on a quarter-acre lot in 2000, the four-bed-\nroom, three-bathroom home has an attached two-car \ngarage, tasteful landscaping, and a manicured lawn. In \n2017, it was home to a family: Petitioners, Hilliard Toi \nCliatt; his partner, Curtrina Martin; and her seven-year-\nold son, G.W. \nBefore dawn on October 18, 2017, FBI Special Agent \nLawrence Guerra led a six-agent SWAT team to 3756 \nDenville Trace. J.A. 4, 21. Failing to confirm the address \nclearly visible on the mailbox, Guerra mistakenly be-\nlieved he had arrived at 3741 Landau Lane\u2014the home \nof gang member Joseph Riley and the address for which \nGuerra had a search warrant. Guerra knew that the tar-\nget house had its address on the mailbox. He also knew \nthat neither Riley nor his associates were known to \ndrive a black Camaro; yet when Guerra saw a black Ca-\nmaro in Petitioners\u2019 driveway that morning, he used the \ncar as a landmark for his team to identify their target. \nPet. App. 3a\u20135a, 7a, 38a & n.3. \nIgnoring these and other conspicuous features that \nwould have averted their mistake, the heavily armed \nSWAT team smashed in the front door of 3756 Denville \nTrace with a battering ram, detonated a flashbang gre-\nnade in the home\u2019s entryway, and rushed inside. Pet. \n\n12 \n \n \nApp. 7a\u20138a; J.A. 5, 22. \nThe explosion startled Petitioners awake. The family \nimmediately believed criminals were invading their \nhome. Martin\u2019s first instinct was to run to her son\u2019s room \nto shield him from the intruders, but Cliatt, acting to \nprotect his partner, grabbed Martin and pulled her into \na walk-in closet. Meanwhile, seven-year-old G.W. hid un-\nder his covers, as his mother screamed, \u201cI need to go get \nmy son,  * * *  I need to go get my son.\u201d Pet. App. 8a, \n39a, 76a\u201377a, 88a; J.A. 5\u20136, 22\u201323. \nMasked FBI agents shoved open the door to the \ncloset where Cliatt and Martin had barricaded them-\nselves. Agents dragged Cliatt out and handcuffed him. \nAnd Martin\u2014half naked\u2014fell to the floor in front of a \nroom full of hostile strangers. As Martin pleaded with \none of the agents to let her see her son, the SWAT team \npointed guns at her and Cliatt. Pet. App. 8a, 88a\u201389a; \nJ.A. 5\u20136, 22\u201323. \nThe agents aggressively questioned Cliatt. But \nwhen he told them his address\u20143756 Denville Trace\u2014\n\u201call the noise just ended.\u201d Pet. App. 8a, 79a. Realizing \nthe SWAT team had raided the wrong house, Agent \nGuerra allowed Cliatt to stand up, unshackled him, and \nsaid, \u201cI\u2019ll be right back.\u201d Id. at 9a, 79a\u201380a; see also J.A. \n7, 24. \nGuerra and his team then went down the block to \n3741 Landau Lane, where they conducted another raid \nat the correct address. Guerra returned to 3756 Denville \nTrace, apologized, documented the property damage he \ncaused, handed Cliatt a business card with his supervi-\nsor\u2019s information, and left the family in stunned disbe-\nlief. Pet. App. 9a, 82a\u201383a. \n\n13 \n \n \n* \n* \n* \nGuerra would later claim that, while he had input \n\u201c3741 Landau Lane\u201d into his GPS, it had directed him to \n3756 Denville Trace instead. But Guerra could not prove \nthis\u2014he threw the GPS away before Petitioners could \nexamine it in discovery. Pet. App. 6a, 9a, 40a\u201341a. \nIII. \nThe lower courts granted the government sov-\nereign immunity for the wrong-house raid. \n1. Petitioners sued the United States under the \nFTCA for the tortious acts of the FBI agents who raided \ntheir home, pleading five counts.\n6 Pet. App. 60a; J.A. 8\u2013\n14, 25\u201330. Citing the discretionary-function exception, \n28 U.S.C. 2680(a), the government moved for summary \njudgment. The district court granted it in part. Pet. App. \n67a. \nThe district court applied Eleventh Circuit prece-\ndent holding that the discretionary-function exception \ndoes not bar claims that fall within the FTCA\u2019s law-en-\nforcement proviso. See Nguyen, 556 F.3d at 1260 \n(\u201c[W]here  * * *  the \u00a7 2680(h) proviso applies to waive \nsovereign immunity, the exception to waiver contained \nin \u00a7 2680(a) is of no effect.\u201d). So the court broke Petition-\ners\u2019 FTCA claims into two groups: four proviso claims \n \n6 Martin and G.W. filed suit separately from Cliatt, but the dis-\ntrict court consolidated the cases. Petitioners also asserted a claim \nagainst Guerra under Bivens, but the Eleventh Circuit granted \nGuerra qualified immunity on the basis that \u201cthe law at the time did \nnot clearly establish that Guerra\u2019s preparatory steps before the \nwarrant execution would violate the Fourth Amendment.\u201d Pet. \nApp. 15a. The questions before the Court concern only Petitioners\u2019 \nFTCA claims. \n\n14 \n \n \n(false arrest, false imprisonment, assault, and battery, \nJ.A. 8\u201310, 25\u201327) and three non-proviso claims (negli-\ngence, trespass, and infliction of emotional distress, J.A. \n10\u201314, 27\u201330). Pet. App. 59a\u201360a. \nThe district court denied summary judgment for \nthree of the four proviso claims. It held that the record \ndid not support a claim for false arrest, Pet. App. 63a, \nbut did support a claim for false imprisonment because \nthe record \u201cshows that the 3741 Landau and Riley war-\nrants were void as to Plaintiffs, and defendants have not \ndemonstrated that the arrest was otherwise legal,\u201d id. \nat 65a. Petitioners\u2019 assault and battery claims likewise \ncould proceed because the FBI agents had unlawfully \ntouched Petitioners. Id. at 65a\u201367a.  \nBut the district court granted summary judgment on \nthe non-proviso claims under the discretionary-function \nexception. Because \u201cGuerra\u2019s efforts in preparing to ex-\necute the warrant at 3741 Landau involved judgment \nand choice\u201d and \u201cno statute, regulation or even internal \noperating procedure prescrib[ed] Guerra\u2019s course of ac-\ntion,\u201d the district court concluded that his decision \u201cin-\nvolve[d] policy considerations and should not be subject \nto judicial second-guessing.\u201d Pet. App. 57a\u201358a (cita-\ntions omitted). \n2. A month after the district court allowed Petition-\ners\u2019 proviso claims to proceed, the Eleventh Circuit is-\nsued Kordash v. United States, 51 F.4th 1289 (11th Cir. \n2022). Kordash extended earlier circuit precedent hold-\ning that the Supremacy Clause bars an FTCA claim if \nthe government employee\u2019s acts had \u201csome nexus with \nfurthering federal policy\u201d and could \u201creasonably be \ncharacterized as complying with the full range of federal \nlaw.\u201d Id. at 1293\u20131294 (quoting Denson, 574 F.3d at \n\n15 \n \n \n1348).  \nThe government moved for reconsideration based on \nKordash (though it had not raised the Supremacy \nClause as an affirmative defense), and the district court \ngranted it. Pet. App. 25a. \u201cBecause Guerra was acting \nwithin the scope of his discretionary duty, and his ac-\ntions did not violate the Fourth Amendment,\u201d the dis-\ntrict court concluded that the Supremacy Clause barred \nPetitioners\u2019 remaining FTCA claims. Id. at 27a.  \n3. Petitioners appealed, but the Eleventh Circuit af-\nfirmed. Like the district court, the circuit court sepa-\nrated Petitioners\u2019 proviso and non-proviso claims. It \nthen held that the discretionary-function exception \nbarred the non-proviso claims and the Supremacy \nClause barred the proviso claims. \nAccording to the circuit court, \u201c[t]he discretionary \nfunction exception applies unless a source of federal law \n\u2018specifically prescribes\u2019 a course of conduct.\u201d Pet. App. \n16a (quoting Shivers v. United States, 1 F.4th 924, 931 \n(11th Cir. 2021)). No federal prescription existed here, \nthe court found, because \u201cthe FBI did not have stringent \npolicies or procedures in place that dictate how agents \nare to prepare for warrant executions.\u201d Pet. App. 17a\u2013\n18a; id. at 18a (\u201c[T]he preparatory actions Guerra took \nbefore the warrant execution\u201d were \u201c\u2018susceptible to pol-\nicy analysis.\u2019\u201d (citation omitted)). \u201cAlthough it is unfor-\ntunate that  * * *  Guerra executed the warrant at the \nwrong house,\u201d the court concluded, \u201chis actions, never-\ntheless, \u2018fall squarely within the discretionary function \nexception.\u2019\u201d Id. at 18a (quoting Shivers, 1 F.4th at 929). \nAs for Petitioners\u2019 proviso claims, the court ex-\nplained that, \u201c[s]imilar to the discretionary function \n\n16 \n \n \nexception, the Supremacy Clause ensures that states do \nnot impede or burden the execution of federal law.\u201d Pet. \nApp. 16a\u201317a (citing Denson, 574 F.3d at 1336\u20131337). \nBecause Guerra \u201cacted within the scope of his discre-\ntionary authority\u201d in conducting the raid and was other-\nwise entitled to qualified immunity, the court held that \nthe Supremacy Clause foreclosed Petitioners\u2019 proviso \nclaims. Pet. App. 19a. \n4. The Eleventh Circuit denied rehearing, and Peti-\ntioners requested this Court\u2019s review. Although, in the \ngovernment\u2019s view, the Eleventh Circuit answers both \nquestions presented incorrectly, the government op-\nposed certiorari. BIO at 8, 21\u201322. Because it believes the \ndecision below \u201ccorrectly held that petitioners\u2019 claims \nare barred, and no court of appeals  * * *  would have \nreached a different result,\u201d the government argued that \nthe Court should deny review. Id. at 8.  \nThis Court granted the petition. \nSUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT \nThe Court should restore the will of Congress ex-\npressed in the text of the FTCA and eliminate the \njudge-made exceptions that bar recovery for proviso \nclaims\u2014here, assault, battery, and false imprisonment. \nCongress originally excluded intentional torts, like \nassault and battery, from the FTCA. But after the Col-\nlinsville raids, Congress reversed course. Through the \nlaw-enforcement proviso, Congress waived sovereign \nimmunity for certain intentional torts by law enforce-\nment officers. Congress meant what it said in the pro-\nviso, and neither the discretionary-function exception \n\n17 \n \n \nnor the Supremacy Clause stands in the way.\n7 \nI. The discretionary-function exception is categori-\ncally inapplicable to claims arising under the law-en-\nforcement proviso. Over the years, however, lower \ncourts have expanded the discretionary-function excep-\ntion, creating conflict with the proviso where none ex-\nists. These interpretations have strayed so far from the \nFTCA\u2019s text that even claims arising out of a wrong-\nhouse raid\u2014the exact scenario Congress created the \nproviso to address\u2014are now excluded.  \nThe Court can solve the problem in one of two ways: \nFirst, by holding that the sort of claims that arise under \nthe proviso do not implicate the discretionary-function \nexception. Second, by holding that the proviso removes \nits claims from Section 2680\u2019s reinstatement of sover-\neign immunity. \nA. The law-enforcement proviso and discretionary-\nfunction exception do not conflict. The former waives \nsovereign immunity for ordinary common-law torts \ncommitted by law enforcement officers that are not \nbased on policy. The latter reinstates sovereign immun-\nity to prevent judicial policy-making via tort suits, with \nparticular \u201cemphasis upon protection for regulatory ac-\ntivities[.]\u201d United States v. Varig Airlines, 467 U.S. 797, \n814 (1984). Both the statutory text and this Court\u2019s \ncases interpreting it emphasize the exception\u2019s regula-\ntory nature. Indeed, this Court has never observed the \n \n7 Petitioners address the questions presented in reverse order \nbecause the government has declined to defend the first question \npresented and because we believe, following the Court\u2019s refinement \nof the second question presented, the issues flow more logically in \nthis order. \n\n18 \n \n \ndiscretionary-function exception to overlap with the in-\ntentional-torts exception, let alone the law-enforcement \nproviso. \nB. If the provisions did conflict, the law-enforcement \nproviso should prevail for six reasons. (1) The proviso\u2019s \ntext expressly negates the reinstatement of sovereign \nimmunity in Section 2680\u2019s preamble. The preamble pro-\nvides that the FTCA \u201cshall not apply\u201d to certain claims, \nbut the proviso retorts that the FTCA \u201cshall apply\u201d to \nclaims arising out of it. (2) Similarly, unlike the definition \nof \u201cinvestigative or law enforcement officer\u201d in Section \n2680(h), the proviso does not just apply \u201cfor the purpose \nof this subsection.\u201d The proviso (3) is more specific and \n(4) was enacted more recently than the exception. (5) \nApplying the exception (as interpreted by the lower \ncourts) to proviso claims would undermine the proviso \nin its core applications. (6) It would also defeat the \nFTCA\u2019s order of operation, which gives the proviso the \nlast word. \nII. The Supremacy Clause cannot restrict legislative \nenactments of Congress. The Eleventh Circuit\u2019s holding \nto the contrary upends our constitutional design. In the \nFTCA, Congress incorporated state tort elements into \nfederal law. This incorporation means that there can be \nno conflict between federal employees\u2019 actions that have \n\u201csome nexus with furthering federal policy\u201d and an ac-\ntual federal law\u2014the FTCA\u2014that waives immunity for \nmany of those actions. But the Eleventh Circuit created \nan exception to Congress\u2019s power to determine the law \nof the land in the name of preserving that power. The \nCourt should make sure that the legislative prerogative \nstays with Congress. \n\n19 \n \n \nARGUMENT \nWhile executing a raid at the wrong house, federal \nlaw enforcement officers subjected Petitioners to as-\nsault, battery, and false imprisonment. These claims fall \nsquarely within the FTCA\u2019s law-enforcement proviso \nthat Congress enacted to provide a remedy for federal \nwrong-house raids. On this point, the statutory text is \nunmistakable: \n[W]ith regard to acts or omissions of investiga-\ntive or law enforcement officers of the United \nStates Government, [the FTCA] shall apply to \nany claim arising  * * *  out of assault, battery, \nfalse imprisonment, false arrest, abuse of process, \nor malicious prosecution.  \n28 U.S.C. 2680(h). \nAt the government\u2019s urging, however, the lower \ncourts have effectively read the law-enforcement pro-\nviso out of the FTCA. We offer the Court several paths \nto restore the cause of action Congress enacted. \nI. \nThe discretionary-function exception is cate-\ngorically inapplicable to claims arising out of \nthe law-enforcement proviso. \nCongress designed the FTCA \u201cto remove the sover-\neign immunity of the United States from suits in tort \nand, with certain specific exceptions, to render the Gov-\nernment liable in tort as a private individual would be \nunder like circumstances.\u201d Richards v. United States, \n369 U.S. 1, 6 (1962); 28 U.S.C. 1346(b)(1), 2680. Two ex-\nceptions are relevant here: the discretionary-function \nexception, 28 U.S.C. 2680(a); and the intentional-torts \n\n20 \n \n \nexception, 28 U.S.C. 2680(h). Both have been part of the \nFTCA since its original enactment in 1946. Legislative \nReorganization Act of 1946, Pub. L. No. 79-601, 60 Stat. \n812, 845\u2013846 (1946).  \nThese exceptions serve different purposes. Through \nthe discretionary-function exception, \u201cCongress wished \nto prevent judicial \u2018second-guessing\u2019 of legislative and \nadministrative decisions grounded in social, economic, \nand political policy through the medium of an action in \ntort.\u201d Varig Airlines, 467 U.S. at 814. At its core, the ex-\nception shields against tort suits that can be resolved \nonly by forcing the judiciary to assess \u201cthe validity of \nlegislation or discretionary administrative action,\u201d like \ndecisions \u201cof a regulatory nature,\u201d \u201cthe expenditure of \nFederal funds,\u201d or \u201cthe execution of a Federal pro-\nject[.]\u201d Dalehite v. United States, 346 U.S. 15, 27 (1953) \n(citation omitted).  \n\u201cOn the other hand, the common law torts of employ-\nees of regulatory agencies, as well as of other Federal \nagencies,\u201d are \u201cwithin the scope of\u201d the FTCA. Varig \nAirlines, 467 U.S. at 810 (citation omitted). These \u201cordi-\nnary common-law torts\u201d were \u201c[u]ppermost in the col-\nlective mind of Congress\u201d when it passed the FTCA. \nDalehite, 346 U.S. at 28 & n.19.  \nStill, Congress did not permit all such torts. To pre-\nclude recovery for certain intentional torts, Congress \nenacted the intentional-torts exception, 28 U.S.C. \n2680(h), which was designed to cover, among others, \nclaims \u201cwhere some agent of the Government gets in a \nfight with some fellow . . . [a]nd socks him.\u201d Shearer, 473 \nU.S. at 55 (citation omitted).  \nBut after the Collinsville raids, Congress saw the \n\n21 \n \n \nerror of its ways: If a federal law enforcement officer \ndoes tortiously sock a fellow, it is only right that the gov-\nernment should provide a remedy. So Congress \namended the FTCA to revive certain intentional-tort \nclaims arising out of \u201cdeliberate attacks\u201d by federal po-\nlice. Shearer, 473 U.S. at 55. This amendment\u2014the law-\nenforcement proviso\u2014\u201cextends the waiver of sovereign \nimmunity\u201d to claims for \u201c\u2018acts or omissions of investiga-\ntive or law enforcement officers.\u2019\u201d Millbrook, 569 U.S. at \n52\u201353 (quoting 28 U.S.C. 2680(h)).  \nRead together, the FTCA plays out like a tennis \npoint: Sovereign immunity applies when the govern-\nment serves. If a plaintiff can return the ball with Sec-\ntion 1346(b) (waiving immunity), she may be able to \nscore. If, however, the government can volley back with \nSection 2680 (reinstating immunity), the plaintiff loses\u2014\nunless the law-enforcement proviso allows her to send \nthe ball back across the net (re-waiving immunity). The \nremainder of the point plays out like a typical tort suit. \nBut the lower courts have thrown out the rules. They \nhave expanded the discretionary-function exception be-\nyond its text and purpose.\n8 As a result, the courts have \ncreated an unnecessary and unjustified conflict within \nSection 2680.  \nThe Court has two paths to fix this problem: It can \nrestore the proper balance to the FTCA by clarifying \nthat, properly understood, the discretionary-function \nexception and the law-enforcement proviso address \n \n8 The different ways in which the circuits have expanded the \ndiscretionary-function exception are the subject of multiple circuit \nsplits. See Xi v. Haugen, 68 F.4th 824, 843 (3d Cir. 2023) (Bibas, J., \nconcurring). \n\n22 \n \n \ncategorically different classes of acts, so the exception \ndoes not bear on the proviso. See Part I(A), infra. Or the \nCourt could adopt a straightforward textual analysis un-\nder which the proviso overrides the discretionary-func-\ntion exception if the two conflict. See Part I(B), infra. \nBoth paths lead to the same outcome in this case: Pe-\ntitioners\u2019 claims arising out of the assault, battery, and \nfalse imprisonment that Agent Guerra and his SWAT \nteam committed as they reenacted the Collinsville raids \nmust be allowed to proceed under the proviso Congress \nenacted to permit these exact claims. \nA. Claims based on discretionary functions do \nnot arise out of the law-enforcement pro-\nviso. \nAfter decades of consideration, the Court has never \nsuggested that the discretionary-function exception, \nSection 2680(a), and the law-enforcement proviso, Sec-\ntion 2680(h), overlap. This is because Sections 2680(a) \nand (h) address categorically distinct claims. And any in-\nterplay that may exist disappears entirely when the \nclaims are limited to those in the proviso.   \ni. \nThe exception does not reach intentional \ntorts like those the proviso permits. \nTo understand why the discretionary-function ex-\nception is inapplicable to claims arising out of the law-\nenforcement proviso, we must understand both provi-\nsions. So we \u201cstart with the text of the statute[.]\u201d Babb \nv. Wilkie, 589 U.S. 399, 404 (2020). \n1. The text of the law-enforcement proviso. Under \nthe intentional-torts exception, the FTCA \u201cshall not \n\n23 \n \n \napply\u201d to: \nAny claim arising out of assault, battery, false im-\nprisonment, false arrest, malicious prosecution, \nabuse of process, libel, slander, misrepresenta-\ntion, deceit, or interference with contract \nrights[.] \nProvided, however, the FTCA \u201cshall apply\u201d to \u201cany \nclaim arising  * * *  out of assault, battery, false impris-\nonment, false arrest, abuse of process, or malicious pros-\necution,\u201d \u201cwith regard to acts or omissions of investiga-\ntive or law enforcement officers of the United States \nGovernment.\u201d 28 U.S.C. 2680(h). \nThis proviso re-waives sovereign immunity. Its lan-\nguage is comprehensive and mandatory: The FTCA \nshall apply to the specified claims if committed by a fed-\neral police officer. Congress created the proviso after \nthe Collinsville raids exposed a gap in the law: While the \nFTCA waived sovereign immunity if a \u201cmail truck \ndriver  * * *  negligently runs down a citizen on the \nstreet[, ]the Federal Government is held harmless if a \nfederal narcotics agent intentionally assaults that same \ncitizen in the course of an illegal \u2018no-knock\u2019 raid.\u201d S. Rep. \n93-588, at 3.  \nCongress placed the proviso in 2680(h)\u2014the inten-\ntional-torts exception. This structural choice communi-\ncates that Congress understood 2680(h) to be the barrier \nto liability, not just for whatever remains after the dis-\ncretionary-function exception is applied, but every time \nlaw enforcement officers \u201cact under color of law so as to \ninjure the public through search[es] and seizures[.]\u201d S. \nRep. 93-588, at 4; see Cope v. Cope, 137 U.S. 682, 688\u2013\n689 (1891) (exception created in a later-enacted proviso \n\n24 \n \n \nshowed that Congress did not think a broader, prior-en-\nacted provision in the statute already barred recovery). \nMoreover, it would be nonsensical for Congress to \ncarve certain police torts out of Section 2680(h), knowing \nfull well that the same torts would be doomed by Section \n2680(a). See Kosak v. United States, 465 U.S. 848, 858 \n(1984) (\u201c[O]ur interpretation of the plain language of the \nprovision accords with what we know of Congress\u2019 gen-\neral purposes in creating exceptions to the Tort Claims \nAct.\u201d). If any ambiguity existed about the overlap of \nSections 2680(a) and (h), the law-enforcement proviso \nput it to rest. \n2. The text of the discretionary-function exception. \nProviso claims are not encompassed by Section 2680(a), \nwhich provides that the FTCA \u201cshall not apply\u201d to: \n(a) Any claim based upon an act or omission of an \nemployee of the Government, exercising due \ncare, in the execution of a statute or regulation, \nwhether or not such statute or regulation be \nvalid, or based upon the exercise or performance \nor the failure to exercise or perform a discretion-\nary function or duty on the part of a federal \nagency or an employee of the Government, \nwhether or not the discretion involved be abused. \n28 U.S.C. 2680(a) (discretionary-function exception un-\nderlined). \nThe discretionary-function exception is restricted to \nclaims \u201cbased upon\u201d a \u201cdiscretionary function\u201d \u201con the \npart of a federal agency or an employee,\u201d which indi-\ncates that it is cabined to the actions of the government \nin promulgating and administering a regulatory policy \nfor four reasons:  \n\n25 \n \n \nFirst, \u201cdiscretionary function\u201d is a term of art. Exer-\ncising a \u201cdiscretionary function\u201d requires the use of \npower conferred by law in certain circumstances to ful-\nfill a definite, policy-based end. In the legal context, \n\u201c[w]hen applied to public functionaries, discretion \nmeans a power or right conferred upon them by law of \nacting officially in certain circumstances[.]\u201d Black\u2019s Law \nDictionary 587 (3d ed. 1933). And \u201cfunction\u201d means, \n\u201c[o]ffice; duty; fulfillment of a definite end or set of ends \nby correct adjustment of means.\u201d Id. at 827. See also \nMolzof v. United States, 502 U.S. 301, 307 (1992) \n(\u201c[W]here Congress borrows a term of art  * * *  it pre-\nsumably knows and adopts the cluster of ideas that were \nattached to each borrowed word[.]\u201d (citation omitted)). \nSecond, the exception\u2019s focus on administrative dis-\ncretion is confirmed by the structure of the whole provi-\nsion. The first half of 2680(a) (the due-care exception) re-\nfers to an \u201cact or omission of an employee\u201d executing a \nstatute or regulation. The second half (the discretion-\nary-function exception), which builds from the first, is \nlimited to \u201ca discretionary function or duty on the part \nof a federal agency or an employee[.]\u201d 28 U.S.C. 2680(a). \nCongress\u2019s choice of language shows that the discretion \nat issue does not include the everyday choices of govern-\nment employees, but the broader regulatory or policy \ndiscretion vested by law. See Xi v. Haugen, 68 F.4th 824, \n843 (3d Cir. 2023) (Bibas, J., concurring) (\u201cThese words \nsuggest that courts should look at the kind of activity  \n* * *  not the action itself.\u201d). Indeed, Section 2680(a) is \nthe only exception in the FTCA that refers to an \n\u201cagency.\u201d This is reinforced by the exception\u2019s require-\nment that the claim must be \u201cbased upon\u201d the perfor-\nmance of a discretionary-function\u2014rather than \u201cari-\n\n26 \n \n \nsing\u201d out of some act. Compare 28 U.S.C. 2680(a) (claim \n\u201cbased upon\u201d), with (b)\u2013(c), (e), (h), (j)\u2013(n) (claim \u201caris-\ning\u201d). The \u201cdiscretionary function\u201d an employee per-\nforms, therefore, must be \u201cbased upon\u201d advancing the \nunderlying regulatory or policy goal. An act without a \ndirect connection to the policy goal cannot be based on \nit. See Cornelius J. Peck, The Federal Tort Claims Act: \nA Proposed Construction of the Discretionary Function \nException, 31 Wash. L. Rev. & State Bar J. 207, 212\u2013\n213, 228\u2013229 (1956) (Peck). \nThird, because the first half of the discretionary-\nfunction exception itself (discretion \u201con the part of a fed-\neral agency\u201d) concerns administrative policy, the second \nhalf of the exception (discretion \u201con the part of  * * *  an \nemployee of the Government\u201d) should be construed as \nlimited to an agency\u2019s policy decisions. See Fischer v. \nUnited States, 603 U.S. 480, 487 (2024) (avoiding an in-\nterpretation of a general term that is broader than the \nprovision\u2019s other terms). Just as plaintiffs cannot bring \nan FTCA claim based on agency policy itself (the first \nhalf), they cannot bring a claim based on the judgment \ncalls employees are legally empowered to make in fur-\ntherance of that policy (the second half). \nFourth, the historical context in which Congress \nadopted the discretionary-function exception confirms \nthis technical understanding. In the two years preceding \nthe FTCA\u2019s enactment, Congress passed two other stat-\nutes concerned with administrative functions that show \nthat a reader in 1947 would have understood \u201cdiscretion-\nary function\u201d to mean agency action in furtherance of \nsome policy. See Reorganization Act of 1945, Pub. L. No. \n79-263, 59 Stat. 613 (1945); Administrative Procedure \nAct, Pub. L. No. 79-404, 60 Stat. 237 (1946). \n\n27 \n \n \nIn the Reorganization Act, instructing the President \nto reorganize federal agencies, Congress repeatedly \nused the word \u201cfunction\u201d to describe the power vested \nby law in an agency. E.g., 59 Stat. at 615, Sec. 5(a)(4) (a \nreorganization plan could not extend \u201cany function be-\nyond the period authorized by law for its exercise\u201d). The \nPresident understood \u201cfunction\u201d this same way. E.g., \nReorg. Plan No. 1 of 1947, \u00a7 101(a), 5 U.S.C. App. 1 \n(\u201c[A]ll functions vested by law in the Alien Property \nCustodian  * * *  are transferred to the Attorney Gen-\neral[.]\u201d).  \nIn the APA, Congress required the separation of cer-\ntain \u201cfunctions\u201d within federal agencies. 5 U.S.C. 554(d). \nAs with the discretionary-function exception, the APA \nexcluded from judicial review certain claims concerning \n\u201cagency action [] committed to agency discretion by \nlaw.\u201d 5 U.S.C. 701(a)(2). Then-Attorney General Robert \nJackson explained that the point was to limit judicial in-\nterference with the types of policy determinations \nvested in the agencies\u2019 discretion. Off. of Att\u2019y Gen., Fi-\nnal Report of the Attorney General\u2019s Committee on Ad-\nministrative Procedure 119 (1941). The examples he \ngave\u2014such as the likelihood that certain equipment will \nreduce locomotive accidents and the amount of fertilizer \nthat can safely remain on apples\u2014track the type of dis-\ncretionary functions Section 2680(a) exempts from \nFTCA liability. E.g., Dalehite, 346 U.S. at 37 (\u201c[T]he \ncabinet-level decision to institute the fertilizer export \nprogram was a discretionary act[.]\u201d).  \nTaken together, the text of Section 2680(a) indicates \nthat the discretionary-function exception applies only \nwhen a claim requires a court to evaluate an employee\u2019s \nexercise of some power conferred on him to fulfill the \n\n28 \n \n \ndefinite ends of an administrative regime. This limited \nexception does not bear on suits alleging proviso torts \ncommitted in workaday law enforcement.  \n3. The Court\u2019s interpretation of the discretionary-\nfunction exception. The Court\u2019s jurisprudence confirms \nthat \u201cdiscretionary function\u201d is a legislative term of art \nthat cannot be disentangled from regulatory policy. In \nits earliest case construing the discretionary-function \nexception, the Court stressed Congress\u2019s focus on \u201cdis-\ncretionary administrative action\u201d and \u201cacts of a govern-\nmental nature or function.\u201d Dalehite, 346 U.S. at 27\u201328 \n(emphasis added).  \nOver the decades, the Court has repeatedly applied \nthis understanding of \u201cdiscretionary function\u201d to deter-\nmine whether the FTCA waives sovereign immunity\u2014\nall but one, negligence cases: \n\u2022 Dalehite v. United States (1953): Discretionary-\nfunction exception protected cabinet-level deci-\nsion to use wartime ingredients to manufacture \nfertilizer for Europe, and the manufacturing that \ncaused an explosion was excepted from the \nFTCA because it was done consistent with the \nagency\u2019s written specifications. 346 U.S. at 38\u201341.  \n\u2022 Indian Towing Co. v. United States (1955): Once \nthe Coast Guard \u201cexercised its discretion to op-\nerate a light[house],\u201d it had a duty to do so with \ndue care. 350 U.S. 61, 69; see also Rayonier Inc. v. \nUnited States, 352 U.S. 315, 318\u2013321 (1957) (al-\nlowing FTCA claims against the Forest Service \nfor negligently allowing a wildfire to spread after \nagreeing to fight the fire and exercising control \nover the scene). \n\n29 \n \n \n\u2022 United States v. United States Trust Co. (1955): \nNegligent operation of an air-traffic control \ntower was not a discretionary function because \nthe government exercised its discretion \u201cwhen it \n[] decided to operate the tower, but the tower \npersonnel had no discretion to operate it negli-\ngently.\u201d Eastern Air Lines, Inc. v. Union Tr. Co., \n221 F.3d 62, 77 (D.C. Cir. 1955), aff\u2019d sub nom. \nUnited States Tr. Co., 350 U.S. 907 (mem.). \n\u2022 Hatahley v. United States (1956): Federal agents\u2019 \nseizure of horses outside of agency procedures \nwas not a discretionary function because their \n\u201cacts were wrongful trespasses not involving dis-\ncretion on the part of the agents[.]\u201d 351 U.S. 173, \n181.  \n\u2022 United States v. Varig Airlines (1984): Pursuant \nto discretion vested by Congress to prescribe an \ninspection regime for airplanes, the FAA adopted \na detailed \u201cspot-check\u201d system. 467 U.S. at 817. \n\u201c[T]he acts of FAA employees in executing the \n\u2018spot-check\u2019 program in accordance with agency \ndirectives are protected by the discretionary \nfunction exception[.]\u201d Id. at 820.  \n\u2022 Berkovitz v. United States (1988): Discretionary-\nfunction exception barred claims that challenged \nan agency\u2019s policy about the appropriate way to \nregulate vaccines but did not bar claims alleging \nthat the agency approved vaccines without fol-\nlowing a specific statutory and regulatory di-\nrective. 486 U.S. 531, 544\u2013547. \n\u2022 United States v. Gaubert (1991): Discretionary-\nfunction exception protected actions taken by \n\n30 \n \n \nbanking regulators, consistent with a formal \nagency policy and adopted pursuant to a statu-\ntory grant of authority, under which the agency \nauthorized individual regulators to weigh the ap-\npropriateness of the agency\u2019s supervisory actions \non a case-by-case basis. 499 U.S. at 330\u2013334. \nThese cases distinguish between claims that require \ncourts to evaluate administrative policy decisions \n(which are barred) and those that do not (which may pro-\nceed). The guiding principle is the separation of powers: \n\u201cCongress wished to prevent judicial \u2018second-guessing\u2019 \nof legislative and administrative decisions grounded in \nsocial, economic, and political policy through the medium \nof an action in tort.\u201d Varig Airlines, 467 U.S. at 814; id. \nat 813\u2013814 (emphasizing the exception\u2019s focus on the \ngovernment acting as a regulator). If it sounds obvious \nthat such claims should be barred, it is; the discretion-\nary-function exception was added as a \u201cclarifying \namendment\u201d to spell out basic principles of judicial con-\nstruction. Dalehite, 346 U.S. at 26\u201327.  \nUltimately, the Court\u2019s application of the discretion-\nary-function exception shakes out into four buckets: (1) \n\u201c[I]f a regulation mandates particular conduct, and the \nemployee obeys the direction,\u201d 2680(a) reinstates sover-\neign immunity, and the claim is barred. (2) If \u201cestab-\nlished governmental policy, as expressed or implied by \nstatute, regulation, or agency guidelines, allows a Gov-\nernment agent to exercise discretion,\u201d 2680(a) presump-\ntively reinstates sovereign immunity, and the claim is \nbarred if the agent exercises discretion to further the \nestablished policy. (3) \u201cIf [an] employee violates [a] man-\ndatory regulation,\u201d 2680(a) does not reinstate sovereign \nimmunity, and the claim can proceed. (4) If no statute, \n\n31 \n \n \nregulation, or agency guideline confers discretion on an \nemployee to take an action, 2680(a) does not reinstate \nsovereign immunity, and the claim can proceed. \nGaubert, 499 U.S. at 324.  \nThis final bucket contains ordinary common-law \ntorts, unmoored from \u201cestablished\u201d policy concerns.\n9 \nThese include, as Gaubert explains, even torts involving \n\u201cobviously discretionary acts.\u201d These torts do not trig-\nger the exception because they are not committed while \nexercising any discretion \u201cbased on the purposes that [a] \nregulatory regime seeks to accomplish.\u201d 499 U.S. at 325 \nn.7; see also id. at 335\u2013337 (Scalia, J., concurring in part). \nAbsent an established policy that confers discretion to \ntake the action at issue, the separation-of-powers con-\ncerns central to the discretionary-function exception fall \naway, and the case is ripe for adjudication. \n4. The differences between the exception and the \nproviso. Of course, federal regulatory policy does not \nconfer discretion on government functionaries to com-\nmit intentional torts like assault and battery. This ex-\nposes the discretionary-function exception\u2019s categorical \ninapplicability to proviso claims: At its core, the excep-\ntion is a shield against suits sounding in negligence that \ncan be resolved only by forcing the judiciary to assess \n\u201cthe validity of legislation or discretionary administra-\ntive action.\u201d Dalehite, 346 U.S. at 27 (citation omitted). \nThe government\u2019s political calculus in setting policies \n \n9 See Peck 230\u2013231 (explaining that, \u201cwhere the act or omission \ninvolved is not one which was directed, or a risk knowingly, delib-\nerately, or necessarily encountered in the furtherance of the objec-\ntives or purposes for which authority was given,  * * *  courts are \nfree to use the ordinary principles of negligence\u201d to decide the \nclaim). \n\n32 \n \n \nand federal officials\u2019 concomitant discretionary decisions \nimplementing them are too close for comfort\u2014a concern \nthat is not present when a plaintiff has the burden to \nmeet the elements of an intentional tort.  \nIt is no coincidence, then, that the only time this \nCourt considered the interaction between an intentional \ntort and the discretionary-function exception, sovereign \nimmunity did not apply. Hatahley, 351 U.S. at 181. In \nHatahley, plaintiffs claimed that government agents il-\nlegally sold or destroyed their horses. Id. at 174. Even \nthough the agents acted \u201cto enforce a federal statute \nwhich they administer,\u201d the Court concluded that their \nacts were \u201cwrongful trespasses.\u201d Id. at 180\u2013181. The \nagents\u2019 wrongful trespasses meant they\u2014like federal \npolice executing a warrant at the wrong address\u2014had \n\u201cno statutory authority\u201d for their actions. Id. at 180. And \nbecause the agents lacked statutory authority, the \nCourt did not need to consider the validity of the statute \nunder which the agents purported to act. Ibid. This, in \nturn, meant there was no risk that the Court would sec-\nond-guess congressional decision-making by applying \nthe elements of trespass to the case. Id. at 181. The dis-\ncretionary-function exception did not apply. Ibid. \nOther examples abound. The easiest is driving: \u201cAlt-\nhough driving requires the constant exercise of discre-\ntion,\u201d this discretion \u201ccan hardly be said to be grounded \nin regulatory policy.\u201d Gaubert, 499 U.S. at 325 n.7. Con-\nsider, too, the example of a U.S. Army B-29 airplane \ncrashing into the Empire State Building.\n10 If the crash \n \n10 This real-life example occurred in 1945 and may have been the \nfinal impetus for Congress\u2019s passage of the FTCA. Gregory C. Sisk, \n \n\n33 \n \n \nhad resulted from a military policy that required pilots \nto fly in a straight line below 1,000 feet to preserve fuel, \nthe policy decision and its consequences (though both \nterrible) would not be appropriate for judicial adjudica-\ntion under the FTCA. But if the military set no flight \npath or altitude policy, the pilot\u2019s decision to fly low and \nin bad weather through Manhattan would be actionable \nbecause it would involve no evaluation of policy. Clearer \nstill, if the pilot had intentionally steered his plane into \nthe building\u2014perhaps because his wife\u2019s lover worked \non the 80th floor\u2014his \u201cconduct [would] not involve any \npermissible exercise of policy judgment.\u201d Berkovitz, 486 \nU.S. at 538 n.3. \n5. Applying the differences. Like flying a plane, \ndriving a car, or stealing a horse, the day-to-day acts of \nline-level federal law enforcement officers\u2014though suf-\nfused with mundane discretion\u2014are not \u201cgrounded in \nregulatory policy.\u201d Gaubert, 499 U.S. at 325 n.7; see also \nHatahley, 351 U.S. at 181. As noted above, this becomes \nconcrete when the elements of a proviso tort are stacked \nup against the separation-of-powers concerns that ani-\nmate the discretionary-function exception. Take Peti-\ntioners\u2019 claim for battery. Under Georgia law, \u201cany un-\nlawful touching is a physical injury to the person and is \nactionable.\u201d Vasquez v. Smith, 576 S.E.2d 59, 62 (Ga. Ct. \nApp. 2003) (citation omitted). And an \u201cunlawful touch-\ning\u201d is one that \u201cwould be offensive to an ordinary \n \nThe Continuing Drift of Federal Sovereign Immunity Jurispru-\ndence, 50 Wm. & Mary L.

See Pet. \nApp. 18a; BIO at 10. And no law gives the FBI discretion \nto raid a house in the absence of a warrant or an excep-\ntion to the warrant requirement. So any discretion \nGuerra had in executing the raid was untethered from \nan \u201cestablished governmental policy\u201d that the discre-\ntionary-function exception was intended to shield. \nGaubert, 499 U.S. at 324. As a result, a judgment in Pe-\ntitioners\u2019 favor does not require a judicial inquiry into \nany regulatory regime\u2014there is no policy to attack \n\u201cthrough the medium of an action in tort.\u201d Varig Air-\nlines, 467 U.S. at 814; see also Hatahley, 351 U.S. at 180\u2013\n181 (declining to apply the exception when a federal \nagent had \u201cno statutory authority\u201d to take the tortious \naction). \nii. \nThe lower courts\u2019 expansion of the ex-\nception creates needless conflict with \nthe proviso. \nThe discretionary-function exception and law-en-\nforcement proviso address different categories of \nclaims. So the provisions do not conflict. But the lower \n \n11 The district court held that Petitioners satisfied these ele-\nments. See Pet. App. 66a\u201367a. \n\n35 \n \n \ncourts have needlessly created conflicts by expanding \nthe reach of the discretionary-function exception. \n1. Since its earliest cases addressing the FTCA, the \nCourt has warned the Act must not be \u201cwhittle[d ]down \nby refinements\u201d or\u2014to the same effect\u2014strictly con-\nstrued in favor of sovereign immunity. United States v. \nYellow Cab Co., 340 U.S. 543, 548 n.5, 550 (1951); see also \nKosak, 465 U.S. at 853 n.9 (warning against \u201cunduly gen-\neration interpretations of the [FTCA\u2019s] exceptions\u201d). \n\u201cThe exemption of the sovereign from suit involves \nhardship enough where consent has been withheld. We \nare not to add to its rigor by refinement of construction \nwhere consent has been announced.\u201d United States v. \nAetna Cas. & Sur. Co., 338 U.S. 366, 383 (1949) (citation \nomitted). \nEven so, most lower courts have expanded the dis-\ncretionary-function exception beyond what its text, its \npurpose, or this Court\u2019s precedent allow. They have \ndone this, in large part, by misapplying the rule this \nCourt laid out in Gaubert. There, the Court created a \ntwo-step test to distinguish between discretionary func-\ntions and run-of-the-mill torts. Step one asks \u201cwhether \nthe challenged actions [involved an element of judgment \nor choice], or whether they were instead controlled by \nmandatory statutes or regulations.\u201d Gaubert, 499 U.S. \nat 328 (citing Berkovitz, 486 U.S. at 536). If the actions \ninvolved an element of judgment, step two asks \n\u201cwhether that judgment is of the kind that the discre-\ntionary function exception was designed to shield,\u201d \nwhich is to say, \u201cdecisions based on considerations of \npublic policy.\u201d Id. at 322\u2013323 (citing Berkovitz, 486 U.S. \nat 536\u2013537).   \nBefore Gaubert, the lower courts \u201chad difficulty in \n\n36 \n \n \napplying th[e] test\u201d for assessing whether a claim falls \nwithin Section 2680(a).

The Eleventh Circuit\u2019s decision in Shivers v. \nUnited States illustrates the circuit confusion surround-\ning Gaubert\u2019s application.  \nIn Shivers, the court converted Section 2680(a) from \na limited exception into a default rule by holding that \n\u201cthe discretionary function exception applies unless a \nsource of federal law \u2018specifically prescribes\u2019 a course of \nconduct.\u201d 1 F.4th at 931 (citing Gaubert, 499 U.S. at 322; \nBerkovitz, 486 U.S. at 536). But this badly misstates the \nCourt\u2019s precedent, as explained above. See C.M. v. \nUnited States, 672 F. Supp. 3d 288, 334 (W.D. Tex. 2023) \n(explaining that \u201cneither cited Supreme Court case [in \nShivers] uses \u2018unless\u2019 in that context\u201d). Federal agencies \nhave no discretion beyond that specifically granted by \nlaw. See West Virginia v. EPA, 597 U.S. 697, 723 (2022) \n(\u201cAgencies have only those powers given to them by \nCongress[.]\u201d). Under Shivers\u2019s interpretation of Section \n2680(a), Gaubert\u2019s permissive first step all but swallows \n\n37 \n \n \nits restrictive second step.\n12  \nBecause lower courts have trouble assessing \u201cthe \ntypes of conduct the \u00a7 2680(a) discretionary function ex-\nception protects[,]\u201d they have unnecessarily forced \nthemselves to consider \u201cwhether and how to apply the \nexception in cases brought under the intentional tort \nproviso[.]\u201d Medina v. United States, 259 F.3d 220, 224 \n(4th Cir. 2001). They have then adopted varying inter-\npretations of both the discretionary-function exception \nand law-enforcement proviso to resolve the conflicts \nthey have created by adopting varying interpretations \nof both the discretionary-function exception and the \nlaw-enforcement proviso.  \nThe Seventh Circuit, for example, resolved the con-\nflict by holding that the proviso waives immunity only \nfor \u201cthe part of \u00a7 2680(h) that precedes the proviso\u201d and \nthat the discretionary-function exception applies to \neven unconstitutional acts. Linder v. United States, 937 \n \n12 The Eleventh Circuit is not alone in over-relying on Gaubert\u2019s \nfirst prong to diminish its second. See, e.g., Medina v. United \nStates, 259 F.3d 220, 228 (4th Cir. 2001) (\u201c[I]f a government em-\nployee has discretion under the first Gaubert prong, it \u2018must be pre-\nsumed\u2019 that his acts \u2018are grounded in policy when exercising that \ndiscretion[.]\u2019\u201d (citation omitted)); Campos v. United States, 888 \nF.3d 724, 735 (5th Cir. 2018) (\u201cThe discretionary function exception \nexists to leave sovereign immunity in place unless the official had \nclear guidance on what to do when presented with what is argued \nto be the relevant evidence.\u201d); Dykstra v. Bureau of Prisons, 140 \nF.3d 791, 795\u2013796 (8th Cir. 1998) (where \u201c[n]o regulatory mandate \nexists,\u201d \u201c\u2018it must be presumed that the agent\u2019s acts are grounded in \npolicy\u2019\u201d (citation omitted)); Esquivel v. United States, 21 F.4th 565, \n574 (9th Cir. 2021) (\u201cWhere the government agent is exercising dis-\ncretion, \u2018it must be presumed that the agent\u2019s acts are grounded in \npolicy when exercising that discretion.\u2019\u201d (citation omitted)). \n\n38 \n \n \nF.3d 1087, 1089\u20131090 (7th Cir. 2019). Meanwhile, the \nFourth Circuit resolved the conflict by holding the op-\nposite\u2014that the discretionary-function exception is in-\napplicable to unconstitutional acts. Medina, 259 F.3d at \n226. See Xi, 68 F.4th at 838 & n.10 (noting the circuit \nsplit). \nNotwithstanding these errors, some courts have at-\ntempted to resolve this judge-made conflict by moving \nin the right direction\u2014narrowing the discretionary-\nfunction exception to \u201cexclude[] most of the actions of \nrank and file federal law enforcement officers.\u201d Nguyen, \n556 F.3d at 1257. \n\u2022 The Second Circuit determined that the actions \nof INS agents who wrongly detained an individ-\nual were \u201cnot the kind that involve weighing im-\nportant policy choices.\u201d Caban v. United States, \n671 F.2d 1230, 1233 (2d Cir. 1982). \n\u2022 The D.C. Circuit explained that, \u201cif the \u2018investi-\ngative or law enforcement officer\u2019 limitation in \nsection 2680(h) is read to include primarily per-\nsons (such as police officers) whose jobs do not \ntypically include discretionary functions, it will \nbe rare that a suit permissible under the proviso \nto section 2680(h) is barred by section 2680(a).\u201d \nGray v. Bell, 712 F.2d 490, 508 (D.C. Cir. 1983). \n\u2022 The Third Circuit noted that \u201c[i]t is hard to imag-\nine instances in which the activities of officers en-\ngaging in searches, seizures or arrests would\u201d fall \nwithin Section 2680(a). Pooler v. United States, \n787 F.2d 868, 872 (3d Cir. 1986), abrogated by \nMillbrook, 569 U.S. 50.  \n\u2022 The Ninth Circuit found that, \u201c[w]hile law enfor-\n\n39 \n \n \ncement involves exercise of a certain amount of \ndiscretion on the part of individual officers, such \ndecisions do not involve the sort of generalized \nsocial, economic and political policy choices that \nCongress intended to exempt from tort liability.\u201d \nGarcia v. United States, 826 F.2d 806, 809 (9th \nCir. 1987). \nAs the Fifth Circuit recognized, a broad reading of \nthe discretionary-function exception would effectively \nrender the law-enforcement proviso a nullity: \u201c[I]f ac-\ntions under the proviso must also clear the hurdle of the \ndiscretionary function exception  * * *  even Bivens and \nCollinsville would not pass muster and the law enforce-\nment proviso would fail to create the effective legal rem-\nedy intended by Congress.\u201d Sutton v. United States, 819 \nF.2d 1289, 1296 (5th Cir. 1987).  \nThis case proves the point\u2014the facts are Collinsville \nby another name. Federal police investigating drug \ncrimes raided an innocent family\u2019s home, incorrectly be-\nlieving it to be their target. In doing so, the agents did \nnot exercise (or abuse) any policy-conferred discre-\ntion\u2014they just made a mistake that inflicted ordinary \ncommon-law torts on Petitioners. Congress enacted the \nproviso to remedy these torts. See Carlson, 446 U.S. at \n20. Surely, Congress did not create this cause of action \nonly for it to be rendered instantly meaningless by the \ndiscretionary-function \nexception. \nSee \nDuncan \nv. \nWalker, 533 U.S. 167, 175 (2001) (noting the \u201cduty to \n\u2018give each word some operative effect\u2019 where possible\u201d \n(citation omitted)). So if the exception bars this case, \nsomething has gone wrong.  \nThe simplest way to resolve this conflict is to hold \nthat the discretionary-function exception is categorical-\n\n40 \n \n \nly inapplicable to the law-enforcement proviso because \nthey cover different government actions. \nB. If the discretionary-function exception and \nlaw-enforcement proviso conflict, the pro-\nviso prevails. \nProperly understood, the discretionary-function ex-\nception and law-enforcement proviso do not conflict. But \nthere\u2019s also a second path for the Court to take: To the \nextent a government functionary could commit an inten-\ntional tort while exercising the government\u2019s lawful ad-\nministrative discretion, the proviso overrides the discre-\ntionary-function exception. The text, structure, and his-\ntory of the FTCA confirm that Congress enacted the \nlaw-enforcement proviso to spare the claims it permits \nfrom the exceptions in Section 2680. \nThe text of the proviso is unequivocal: The FTCA \n\u201cshall apply to any claim\u201d arising under the proviso. 28 \nU.S.C. 2680(h). But so, too, is the text of the discretion-\nary-function exception: The FTCA \u201cshall not apply to \nany claim\u201d that is based on a discretionary function. 28 \nU.S.C. 2680(a) (condensed). To figure out \u201cwhat happens \nwhen two \u2018anys\u2019 face off,\u201d we must turn to the structure \nof the FTCA and canons of construction. Nguyen, 556 \nF.3d at 1252. \nThe Eleventh Circuit is the only circuit to correctly \nhold that, if the provisions conflict, the law-enforcement \nproviso prevails. In Nguyen v. United States, Judge Ed \nCarnes wrote for the court that, \u201cif a claim is one of those \nlisted in the proviso to subsection (h), there is no need to \ndetermine if the acts giving rise to it involve a discre-\ntionary function; sovereign immunity is waived in any \n\n41 \n \n \nevent.\u201d 556 F.3d at 1257. In reaching this conclusion, \nNguyen relied on the general/specific canon, the ear-\nlier/later canon, and the congressional purpose of the \nlaw-enforcement proviso, which Nguyen drew from an \nextended review of the Collinsville raids and the con-\ngressional record. Id. at 1252\u20131257. \nThe text of the intentional-torts exception confirms \nthat Nguyen is correct. Read in full, Section 2680(h) con-\ntains three sentences: \nThe Preamble \nThe provisions of this chapter and section 1346(b) \nof this title shall not apply to\u2014(h) Any claim aris-\ning out of assault, battery, false imprisonment, \n[etc.]: \nThe Proviso \nProvided, That, with regard to acts or omissions \nof investigative or law enforcement officers of the \nUnited States Government, the provisions of this \nchapter and section 1346(b) of this title shall ap-\nply to any claim arising  * * *  out of assault, bat-\ntery, false imprisonment, [etc.] \nThe Definition \nFor the purpose of this subsection, \u201cinvestigative \nor law enforcement officer\u201d means any officer of \nthe United States who is empowered by law to \nexecute searches, to seize evidence, or to make \narrests for violations of Federal law. \nEngaging with this text provides six reasons why \nthe discretionary-function exception is inapplicable to \nclaims arising under the law-enforcement proviso: \n\n42 \n \n \nFirst, the proviso\u2019s text cancels out the preamble.\n \nThis is important because the preamble reinstates im-\nmunity for the exceptions: If \u201c[a]ny claim\u201d falls into the \nexception, the preamble provides that the FTCA \u201cshall \nnot apply,\u201d triggering sovereign immunity for the claim. \nBut the proviso counteracts this operation. By drafting \nthe proviso to mirror the preamble\u2014only changing \n\u201cshall not\u201d to \u201cshall\u201d\u2014Congress designed the proviso to \nre-waive the sovereign immunity that the preamble re-\ninstates. Compare: \nSection 2680 \nThe provisions of this chapter and section 1346(b) \nof this title shall not apply.  \nSection 2680(h) \nThe provisions of this chapter and section 1346(b) \nof this title shall apply. \n(Emphasis added, cleaned up.) This inversion of the op-\nerative language also makes clear that the preamble is \nthe proviso\u2019s antecedent. See Alaska v. United States, \n545 U.S. 75, 115 (2005) (Scalia, J., concurring in part and \ndissenting in part); see also Antonin Scalia & Bryan A. \nGarner, Reading Law: The Interpretation of Legal \nTexts 154\u2013155 (2012) (E.g., \u201c[T]he authorization or im-\nposition that [a proviso] modifies is often found not im-\nmediately before but several clauses earlier.\u201d (citing, in-\nter alia, Pennington v. United States, 48 Ct. Cl. 408, 411, \n415 (1913))). \nSecond, the proviso reaches beyond Section 2680(h) \nto cover all of Section 2680, including the discretionary-\nfunction exception. This follows from the point above, as \nwell as the text of Section 2680(h)\u2019s definition. Unlike \n\n43 \n \n \nthe proviso, the definition only applies \u201c[f]or the purpose \nof this subsection.\u201d\n13 28 U.S.C. 2680(h). Had Congress in-\ntended to similarly limit the proviso, it would have \nplaced this limiting prepositional phrase before the pro-\nviso.\n14 Instead, Congress placed it after the proviso, \ncommunicating that the proviso applies beyond Section \n2680(h). See Millbrook, 569 U.S. at 57 (explaining that, \n\u201c[h]ad Congress intended to further narrow the scope of \nthe proviso,\u201d it could have \u201cadopted [the] similar limita-\ntions [it used] in neighboring\u201d language). The structure \nand words Congress chose must be given meaning. See \nSimmons v. Himmelreich, 578 U.S. 621, 627 (2016). \nThird, the proviso is more specific than the discre-\ntionary-function exception. When a statute contains \u201ca \ngeneral permission or prohibition [that] is contradicted \nby a specific prohibition or permission,  * * *  the specific \nprovision is construed as an exception to the general \none.\u201d RadLAX Gateway Hotel, LLC v. Amalgamated \nBank, 566 U.S. 639, 645 (2012); see also Department of \nCom. v. New York, 588 U.S. 752, 830 (2019) (Alito, J., \nconcurring in part) (\u201c[I]f there is tension between a spe-\ncific provision  * * *  and a general one  * * *  the specific \nprovision must take precedence.\u201d). Section 2680(a) \n \n13 This makes sense. If the definition were not so limited, it \nwould have given \u201claw enforcement officer\u201d conflicting meanings in \nSections 2680(c) and (h). See Ali v. Federal Bureau of Prisons, 552 \nU.S. 214, 227\u2013228 (2008) (construing \u201cany other law enforcement of-\nficer\u201d in Section 2680(c) more broadly than the definition in Section \n2680(h)). \n14 In this alternate reality, the proviso would read: \u201cProvided, \nThat, for the purpose of this subsection, with regard to acts or omis-\nsions of investigative or law enforcement officers of the United \nStates Government, the provisions of this chapter and section \n1346(b) of this title shall apply to any claim  * * *  .\u201d \n\n44 \n \n \ncreates a general prohibition against claims based on \ndiscretionary functions, while Section 2680(h) provides \nspecific permission for claims arising out of six enumer-\nated torts when committed by an \u201cinvestigative or law \nenforcement officer.\u201d Thus, if the provisions conflict, the \nproviso pierces the exception. \nFourth, the proviso was enacted 28 years after the \ndiscretionary-function exception. It is an \u201cestablished \nrule that a later adopted provision takes precedence \nover an earlier, conflicting provision of equal stature[.]\u201d \nTennessee Wine & Spirits Retailers Ass\u2019n v. Thomas, \n588 U.S. 504, 519 (2019). If there is a conflict between the \nprovisions, again, the law-enforcement proviso \u201ctakes \nprecedence.\u201d \nFifth, applying the discretionary-function exception \nto the proviso threatens to invalidate the latter when it \nshould uncontroversially apply. See United States v. \nCastleman, 572 U.S. 157, 178 (2014) (Scalia, J., concur-\nring in part and concurring in the judgment) (\u201cCongress \npresumably does not enact useless laws.\u201d). This threat is \nexacerbated by the state of play in the lower courts, \nwhere discretionary-function exception jurisprudence \n\u201chas gone off the rails.\u201d Chadd v. United States, 794 F.3d \n1104, 1114 (9th Cir. 2015) (Berzon, J., concurring). The \napplication of the exception to proviso claims will lock \nthose claims inside the labyrinth of circuit splits inter-\npreting the exception. At best, this will render recovery \nunder the proviso inconsistent, circuit-dependent, and \nrandom. At worst, it will completely nullify the proviso \nin its core applications. Either way, subjecting proviso \nclaims to the discretionary-function exception would \nflout the text, context, and history of the proviso to \nreach \u201ca result that Congress  * * *  did not intend.\u201d \n\n45 \n \n \nPOM Wonderful LLC v. Coca-Cola Co., 573 U.S. 102, 116 \n(2014).  \nSixth, the structure of the FTCA sets an order of op-\neration that ends with the law-enforcement proviso\u2019s \nwaiver of sovereign immunity for \u201cany claim\u201d arising \nunder it. By default, the government is entitled to sov-\nereign immunity at step one. At step two, Section \n1346(b)(1) waives this immunity. At step three, Section \n2680\u2019s preamble reinstates sovereign immunity. And at \nstep four, the law-enforcement proviso re-waives im-\nmunity once and for all. \nThis sequence answers a natural question about the \nproviso\u2019s scope: If the proviso states that \u201cthe provisions \nof this chapter  * * *  shall apply,\u201d and Section 2680(a) is \na provision of the chapter, does the proviso reincorpo-\nrate the discretionary-function exception?\n15 No, because \nthe proviso has the last word. See Dolan v. USPS, 546 \nU.S. 481, 486 (2006) (\u201cInterpretation of a word or phrase \ndepends upon reading the whole statutory text, consid-\nering the purpose and context of the statute, and con-\nsulting any precedents or authorities that inform the \nanalysis.\u201d). \nOtherwise, any claim that triggers both the proviso \nand any exception would set off an infinite loop, vacillat-\ning between granting and waiving immunity: Section \n2680(a) applies, so \u201cthe provisions of this chapter  * * *   \n \n15 See Simmons, 578 U.S. at 627 (holding that the FTCA\u2019s judg-\nment bar, 28 U.S.C. 2676, \u201cshall not apply\u201d when a claim falls within \nSection 2680 because the judgment bar is one of the \u201cprovisions of \nthis chapter\u201d); accord Thacker v. TVA, 587 U.S. 218, 223 (2019) \n(\u201cNor does the FTCA\u2019s exception for discretionary functions apply \nthe TVA,\u201d which is exempted by Section 2680(l).). \n\n46 \n \n \nshall not apply\u201d; provided, the proviso applies, so \u201cthe \nprovisions of this chapter  * * *  shall apply\u201d; Section \n2680(a) is a provision of this chapter, so Section 2680(a) \napplies, so \u201cthe provisions of this chapter  * * *  shall not \napply\u201d; provided, the proviso applies, etc.  \nTaken together, this all leads to the conclusion that, \nif the provisions conflict, the discretionary-function ex-\nception is categorically inapplicable to claims arising un-\nder the law-enforcement proviso. This interpretation is \nconsistent with the text and maintains the FTCA as a \ncoherent statutory scheme. \nBolstering this textual analysis, all persuasive indi-\ncations from Congress\u2019s enactment of the law-enforce-\nment proviso point in one direction: Congress expected \nthe proviso to \u201csubmit the Government to liability\u201d in \n\u201cany case in which a Federal law enforcement agent \ncommitted the tort while acting within the scope of his \nemployment or under color of Federal law.\u201d S. Rep. 93-\n588, at 4. Such a robust waiver of sovereign immunity \nwould, of course, also apply \u201cwhenever [federal] \nagents  * * *  injure the public through search[es] and \nseizures that are conducted without warrants or with \nwarrants issued without probable cause.\u201d Ibid.; see gen-\nerally John C. Boger et al., The Federal Tort Claims Act \nIntentional Torts Amendment: An Interpretative Anal-\nysis, 54 N.C. L. Rev. 497 (1976) (providing a thorough \ncontemporary discussion of the events surrounding the \nenactment of the law-enforcement proviso). \n* \n* \n* \nAgent Guerra and his FBI SWAT team injured Pe-\ntitioners through a search and seizure conducted \n\n47 \n \n \nwithout a warrant\u2014at least for Petitioners\u2019 home. The \nFTCA provides them the right to submit the govern-\nment to liability for the federal agents\u2019 assault, battery, \nand false imprisonment. Whichever path it takes to this \nconclusion, the Court should honor the text Congress \nenacted. \nII. \nThe Supremacy Clause does not bar FTCA \nclaims because the FTCA is a federal statute. \nAs explained above, Nguyen v. United States is the \nonly circuit-court decision that correctly answers the \nsecond question presented. Had the Eleventh Circuit \nsimply applied Nguyen\u2019s straightforward rule below, it \nwould have allowed Petitioners\u2019 proviso claims to pro-\nceed. But to circumvent that rule just months after it \nwas created, the Eleventh Circuit created the Suprem-\nacy Clause bar in Denson v. United States. Under this \nbar, the FTCA \u201chas no effect\u201d whenever a government \nemployee\u2019s action \u201cha[s] some nexus with furthering \nfederal policy and can reasonably be characterized as \ncomplying with the full range of federal law.\u201d Denson, \n574 F.3d 1318, 1348 (11th Cir. 2009). No other circuit has \nadopted this bar, and the government does not defend it \nbefore this Court. That\u2019s because the bar finds no sup-\nport in even the faintest penumbras of American consti-\ntutional design. \n1. Key to our federal system, the Supremacy Clause \nprovides: \u201cThis Constitution, and the Laws of the \nUnited States  * * *  shall be the supreme Law of the \nLand[.]\u201d U.S. Const. art. VI, cl. 2. To state the obvious, \nthe Federal Tort Claims Act is a federal law. This means \nthat it is a manifestation of \u201cthe supreme Law of the \nLand\u201d the founders designed the Supremacy Clause to \n\n48 \n \n \nsafeguard. Thus, the FTCA does not\u2014it cannot\u2014con-\nflict with the Supremacy Clause. \nEven so, the Eleventh Circuit created the Suprem-\nacy Clause bar believing it would \u201cpromote[] sound so-\ncial policy and provide[ law enforcement officers] a de-\ngree of flexibility and protection[.]\u201d Denson, 574 F.3d at \n1344. The court\u2019s theory began from the premise that \n\u201can officer of the United States cannot be held in viola-\ntion of state law while simultaneously executing his du-\nties as prescribed by federal law.\u201d Id. at 1347 (drawing \na \u201cbroader application\u201d from In re Neagle, 135 U.S. 1, 57 \n(1890)). And because the FTCA provides relief \u201cin ac-\ncordance with the law of the place where the act  * * *  \noccurred,\u201d 28 U.S.C. 1346(b)(1)\u2014typically, state tort \nlaw\u2014the Eleventh Circuit concluded that \u201cliability \nsimply cannot attach to the acts taken by federal officers \nin the course of their duties and committed in compli-\nance with federal law[.]\u201d Denson, 574 F.3d at 1349.  \nThe Eleventh Circuit recently expanded the bar by \nholding that there is a sufficient federal nexus to pre-\nclude FTCA claims whenever a federal employee acts \nwithin the scope of his \u201cdiscretionary authority.\u201d Kor-\ndash v. United States, 51 F.4th 1289, 1294 (11th Cir. \n2022); see also Pet. App. 25a\u201326a. In effect, the Suprem-\nacy Clause bar is just the discretionary-function excep-\ntion with an added constitutional-violation requirement. \nSee Kordash, 51 F.4th at 1294. \n2. The Eleventh Circuit\u2019s Supremacy Clause bar im-\npermissibly usurps Congress\u2019s sole authority to waive \nsovereign immunity. This Court has made clear that \nCongress \u201chas full power to endow [] an entity with the \ngovernment\u2019s immunity from suit,\u201d and it also has \u201cfull \npower to waive that immunity and subject the entity to \n\n49 \n \n \nthe judicial process to whatever extent it wishes.\u201d \nThacker v. TVA, 587 U.S. 218, 226 (2019) (cleaned up). \nWhen Congress does so, it \u201craises no separation of pow-\ners problems.\u201d Ibid. \u201cThe right governmental actor \n(Congress) is making a decision within its bailiwick (to \nwaive immunity) that authorizes an appropriate body (a \ncourt) to render a legal judgment.\u201d Ibid. If Congress\u2019s \nwaiver of immunity based on political decisions does not \noffend the horizontal separation of powers, it certainly \ndoes not offend the federal government\u2019s power to cre-\nate the supreme law of the land. \nJudge Carnes (who had authored Nguyen just five \nmonths earlier) pointed this out in his Denson concur-\nrence: \u201c[U]nder the FTCA, there can be no [conflict be-\ntween state and federal law] because the sovereign has \nincorporated state tort law into federal law to the extent \nstated in that statute.\u201d 574 F.3d at 1352. \u201cIt is, of course, \nnot uncommon for Congress to direct that state law be \nused to fill the interstices of federal law.\u201d Moor v. \nCounty of Alameda, 411 U.S. 693, 701 & n.11 (1973) (list-\ning several examples, including the FTCA). And when \nCongress incorporates elements of state law in a federal \ncause of action, it does not matter \u201c[w]hether the rules \nof substantive law applied by the federal courts are de-\nrived from federal or state sources.\u201d Association of \nWestinghouse Salaried Emps. v. Westinghouse Elec. \nCorp., 348 U.S. 437, 463\u2013464 (1955) (Reed, J., concur-\nring) (referencing the FTCA). Federal incorporation \nmeans that \u201c[t]he rules are truly federal, not state[,]\u201d \nand the \u201ccause of action aris[es] under federal law, the \nsource of federal judicial power under Art. III of the \nConstitution.\u201d Id. at 464. And if federal judicial power \nexists, courts have a \u201cduty to exercise it[.]\u201d Second \n\n50 \n \n \nEmps.\u2019 Liab. Cases, 223 U.S. 1, 58 (1912). \n3. The government suggests, and we agree, that the \nEleventh Circuit created the Supremacy Clause bar in \nDenson to neutralize the effect of its earlier decision in \nNguyen. Compare BIO at 20 (noting as Denson\u2019s prem-\nise that \u201cCongress could not have intended that the \nUnited States would be held liable for the actions of its \nlaw enforcement officers that are discretionary and \nwithin the scope of their official duties\u201d), with Nguyen, \n556 F.3d at 1260 (holding that, where \u201cthe [law-enforce-\nment] proviso applies to waive sovereign immunity, the \n[discretionary-function exception] is of no effect\u201d). Be-\ncause Nguyen made it impossible to otherwise pare back \nthe FTCA\u2019s waiver of sovereign immunity, the Elev-\nenth Circuit simply created another exception to the \nAct, ruling it unconstitutional in most of its core applica-\ntions.\n16  \nAlthough the government does not defend this posi-\ntion before the Court, it nevertheless contends that the \nSupremacy Clause bar reaches the correct outcome\u2014\nthe denial of Petitioners\u2019 FTCA claims. BIO at 21. This \nignores the Court\u2019s clear guidance: Whether in form or \nsubstance, courts should not \u201cimport immunity back into \na statute designed to limit it.\u201d Indian Towing, 350 U.S. \n \n16 Given that the FTCA creates liability for actions taken by \nfederal employees \u201cwithin the scope of [their] office or employ-\nment,\u201d 28 U.S.C. 1346(b)(1), it is difficult to imagine many scenarios \nthat satisfy that requirement but do not have \u201csome nexus with fur-\nthering federal policy and can[not] reasonably be characterized as \ncomplying with the full range of federal law,\u201d Denson, 574 F.3d at \n1348 (emphasis added). At minimum, the Supremacy Clause bar \nsquelches most of the claims Congress enacted the FTCA to per-\nmit. See Dalehite, 346 U.S. at 28. \n\n51 \n \n \nat 69. That is true no matter whether immunity is im-\nported through the expansion of the discretionary-func-\ntion exception, the restriction of the law-enforcement \nproviso, or the creation of the Supremacy Clause bar.  \nCongress has provided Petitioners with a cause of \naction for the torts committed against them by the FBI \nagents who wrongfully raided their home, but the Elev-\nenth Circuit has taken it away. This Court should return \nit. \u201cIf the Act is to be altered that is a function for the \nsame body that adopted it.\u201d Rayonier, 352 U.S. at 320. \nCONCLUSION \nThe Court should reverse the Eleventh Circuit, hold \nthat the Supremacy Clause does not bar claims under \nthe FTCA, hold that the discretionary-function excep-\ntion is categorically inapplicable to claims arising under \nthe law-enforcement proviso to the intentional-torts ex-\nception, and remand this case for further proceedings. \nRespectfully submitted on March 7, 2025, \nLisa C.

          "task_beliefs": "My understanding of this case has undergone a critical resolution. The primary uncertainty regarding the case's procedural posture has been definitively settled, and the strategic landscape for the merits arguments is now in sharp focus.\n\n1.  **Case Status (Resolved):** Certiorari has been granted. The conflicting signals have been reconciled into a clear timeline. The case proceeded through the standard cert-stage briefing in late 2024 (Petition, Brief in Opposition, Reply Brief) and the Supreme Court granted the petition in early 2025 (as evidenced by the citation \"2025 WL 301915\" found in a subsequent filing). The \"Motion for Divided Argument\" from April 2025 confirms the case is now on the merits and proceeding toward oral argument. My initial, discarded belief about a January 2025 cert grant was likely correct, but based on unverified data; it is now confirmed through primary source documents.\n\n2.  **Legal Questions Before the Court (Clarified):** The cert grant was not on all questions presented by the petitioners, but was specifically limited to two issues:\n    *   **The Supremacy Clause Issue:** Whether the Eleventh Circuit erred in holding that the Supremacy Clause bars FTCA claims against the government for the torts of its employees.\n    *   **The Statutory Interpretation Issue:** Whether the discretionary function exception (\u00a7 2680(a)) is categorically inapplicable to claims that fall under the law enforcement proviso (\u00a7 2680(h)). This question was added at the urging of the government, which framed it as a \"threshold\" issue.\n\n3.  **Parties' Arguments on the Merits (Sharpened):** The filings have revealed a complex, three-sided argument.\n    *   **Petitioners (Martin):** Their position remains consistent: the Eleventh Circuit erred on both the Supremacy Clause and the discretionary function exception. They argue that the law enforcement proviso was specifically enacted to allow claims like theirs and that it operates independently of the discretionary function exception, a view shared by the Eleventh Circuit's own precedent in *Nguyen v. United States*.\n    *   **Respondents (U.S. Government):** The government has executed a strategic pivot. In its merits briefing (foreshadowed in the Motion for Divided Argument), it is abandoning the Eleventh Circuit's Supremacy Clause reasoning. It will argue *against* the lower court on that point. However, it seeks to have the judgment affirmed on alternative grounds. Its central argument is that the Eleventh Circuit's precedent (*Nguyen*) is wrong and that the discretionary function exception (\u00a7 2680(a)) *does* apply to claims under the law enforcement proviso (\u00a7 2680(h)), and that the agents' actions in this case fall under that exception.\n    *   **Court-Appointed Amicus Curiae:** The Court has appointed an amicus to argue in support of the judgment below, specifically on the Supremacy Clause issue. This means the amicus will defend the very reasoning the U.S. government has disavowed.\n\n4.  **Predictive Model (Refined):** My prediction has shifted entirely to the merits, with a much higher degree of granularity.\n    *   **On the Supremacy Clause Question:** The Court is now highly likely to **reverse** the Eleventh Circuit. It is exceptionally rare for the Court to affirm on a ground that the winning party below (the government) has explicitly abandoned. The appointment of an amicus to defend this position suggests the Court wants to thoroughly vet and reject it, not adopt it.\n    *   **On the Statutory Interpretation Question:** This is the decisive battleground. The case's outcome hinges on whether the Court finds that the law enforcement proviso (\u00a7 2680(h)) creates a carve-out from the discretionary function exception (\u00a7 2680(a)). The government's position is that the exceptions are independent; the petitioners' position is that the proviso would be meaningless if discretionary acts by law enforcement were still immune. The Court's decision to grant cert on this question signals its intent to resolve a known and acknowledged circuit split. The outcome is uncertain, but the government's focus on this issue suggests they believe it is their strongest path to victory. My previous high confidence in a petitioner win on the merits is now tempered; they will likely win on the Supremacy Clause, but could lose the case entirely on the statutory question.",
          "design_beliefs": "This observation provides powerful validation for several core principles and introduces new, more nuanced heuristics for legal analysis.\n\n1.  **Internal Consistency Checking (Validated & Refined):** This is now a cornerstone principle. The detection of a contradiction in my previous belief state (cert vs. merits) correctly triggered a high-priority interrupt. The subsequent action, a targeted search to resolve that specific contradiction, was maximally efficient and informative. The refined principle is: **The research cycle must include a continuous background check for internal consistency. When a contradiction is detected, all other goals are subordinated to resolving it, as it points to the area of maximum uncertainty and potential information gain.**\n\n2.  **Metadata is Evidentiary (Reinforced):** This principle is proven to be a high-yield, low-cost tool. Scrutinizing document titles (\"Brief in Opposition,\" \"Reply Brief,\" \"Motion for Divided Argument\") and filenames allowed for a rapid and accurate reconstruction of the case's procedural timeline, turning a confusing set of documents into a clear narrative.\n\n3.  **Map Arguments to Procedural Stage (Refined):** This principle is now more sophisticated. The government's arguments in its \"Brief in Opposition\" were not just cert-stage tactics; they were a preview of their merits strategy. The \"weak defense\" of the Supremacy Clause was a strategic concession to pivot to what they perceive as stronger ground (the discretionary function exception). The refined principle is: **A party's cert-stage arguments, especially concessions or alternative arguments, are strong signals of their intended merits strategy. A \"weak defense\" on one issue can signal a strategic pivot to another.**\n\n4.  **Prioritize Primary Sources (New Principle):** While secondary analysis is useful, direct access to primary source docket files proved to be the only way to definitively resolve the core procedural uncertainty. For questions of case status, granted questions, and party strategy, docket files are the ground truth.\n\n5.  **The \"Amicus in Support of the Judgment\" Heuristic (New Heuristic):** When the Court appoints an amicus to defend the judgment below on a ground the respondent has abandoned, it is a strong signal that the Court is skeptical of that ground. It suggests the Court wants the argument fully aired before rejecting it, making a reversal on that specific point highly probable.\n\n6.  **The \"Conditional Cert Grant\" Heuristic (New Heuristic):** Observing the government's successful tactic\u2014arguing in its opposition brief that *if* the Court grants cert on the petitioner's question, it should *also* grant on a \"threshold\" statutory question\u2014is a valuable pattern to recognize. It reveals a respondent who believes the lower court reached the right result for the wrong reason and is providing the Supreme Court with an alternative path to affirmance. The Court's acceptance of such an invitation is a clear roadmap to the central issues it intends to resolve.\n\n7.  **The Research Cycle is Paramount (Confirmed):** The cycle of **Plan -> Locate -> Retrieve & Verify -> Synthesize -> Check for Internal Consistency -> Refine Plan** has been executed flawlessly. The synthesis from the last observation led to a refined plan (\"resolve procedural status\"), the execution of which provided the data for this updated, more robust belief state. The next logical step in the cycle is to refine the plan again, likely to research the substantive circuit split on the interaction between FTCA \u00a7 2680(a) and \u00a7 2680(h)."

App. 2a-19a) \nis available at 2024 WL 1716235.  The order of the dis-\ntrict court (Pet. App. 21a-32a) is available at 2022 WL \n18263039.  A prior order of the district court (Pet. App. \n34a-68a) is reported at 631 F. Supp. 3d. 1281.  \nJURISDICTION \nThe judgment of the court of appeals was entered on \nApril 22, 2024.  A petition for rehearing was denied on \nMay 30, 2024. (Pet. App. 70a-71a).  On July 22, 2024, \nJustice Thomas extended the time within which to file a \npetition for a writ of certiorari to and including Septem-\nber 27, 2024, and the petition was filed on that day.  The \njurisdiction of this Court is invoked under 28 U.S.C. \n1254(1). \n\n2 \n \nSTATEMENT \n1. The Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA), 28 U.S.C. \n1346(b), 2671 et seq., enacted in 1946, generally waives \nthe sovereign immunity of the United States and cre-\nates a cause of action for damages against the United \nStates with respect to certain torts of federal employ-\nees, acting within the scope of their employment, under \ncircumstances in which a private individual would be li-\nable under state law.  See 28 U.S.C. 1346(b)(1).  The \nFTCA contains various exceptions that limit the waiver \nof sovereign immunity and the substantive scope of the \nUnited States\u2019 liability, including an exception for any \nclaim \u201cbased upon the exercise or performance or the \nfailure to exercise or perform a discretionary function \nor duty on the part of a federal agency or an employee \nof the Government, whether or not the discretion in-\nvolved be abused.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 2680(a).   \nThe FTCA also excludes from its waiver of sovereign \nimmunity most intentional torts:  \u201c[a]ny claim arising \nout of assault, battery, false imprisonment, false arrest, \nmalicious prosecution, abuse of process, libel, slander, \nmisrepresentation, deceit, or interference with contract \nrights.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 2680(h).  In 1974, Congress added a \nproviso to the intentional tort exception, known as the \nlaw enforcement proviso.  See Act of Mar. 16, 1974, Pub. \nL. No. 93-253, \u00a7 2, 88 Stat. 50.  The law enforcement \nproviso states that \u201cthe provisions of this chapter and \nsection 1346(b) of this title shall apply to any claim aris-\ning  * * *  out of assault, battery, false imprisonment, \nfalse arrest, abuse of process, or malicious prosecution\u201d \nthat is based on \u201cacts or omissions of investigative or \nlaw enforcement officers of the United States Govern-\nment.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 2680(h). \n\n3 \n \n2. In 2015, the Federal Bureau of Investigation \n(FBI) initiated an operation concerning violent gang ac-\ntivity in Georgia.  Pet. App. 4a.  The operation ultimately \nresulted in the criminal indictment of several individu-\nals, including Joseph Riley.  Id. at 3a-4a.  Officers ob-\ntained warrants for Riley\u2019s arrest and for the search of \nhis home at 3741 Landau Lane SW, Atlanta, Georgia \n30331.  Id. at 4a.     \nThe FBI assigned Special Agent Lawrence Guerra \nto lead a Special Weapons and Tactics (SWAT) team in \nthe execution of the search warrant.  Pet. App. 4a-5a.  \nThe FBI has a standard operating procedure that re-\nquires its agents to conduct a site survey or a drive-by \nbefore executing a high-risk warrant, such as the one \nfor Riley\u2019s arrest.  Id. at 5a.  The FBI, however, does \nnot have any policies that govern how to locate or navi-\ngate to a target address.  Ibid.   \nGuerra took several steps in preparation to execute \nthe warrant.  He reviewed information that other FBI \nagents had obtained through surveillance of Riley and \n3741 Landau Lane.  Pet. App. 4a-6a.  He conducted a \nsite survey of 3741 Landau Lane, during which he took \nphotographs and identified specific features of the home \nso that he could locate the property when executing the \nwarrant in the early morning.  Id. at 5a.  Guerra noted \nthat the house was beige and split-level, located on a \ncorner lot, had a driveway and garage facing a separate \nstreet that ran perpendicular to the front door, and had \na large tree in the front corner of the property.  Ibid.  \nGuerra also wrote tactical notes outlining how his team \nwould execute the warrant, and he attended an opera-\ntional briefing, which included presentations on and \nphotographs of Riley and 3741 Landau Lane.  Id. at 6a.  \n\n4 \n \nIn the pre-dawn hours of October 18, 2017, Guerra \nconducted a further drive-by with FBI Special Agent \nMichael Lemoine.  Pet. App. 4a, 6a.  Navigating in com-\nplete darkness, Guerra used his personal GPS device to \nlocate 3741 Landau Lane.  Ibid.  When the GPS unit \nalerted that they had arrived at 3741 Landau Lane, \nGuerra observed what he believed to be the same house \nhe had seen during his previous site survey: the home \nwas beige and split-level, located on a corner lot, had a \ntight stairway and stoop leading to the front door with \nwindows on either side, had a driveway and garage fac-\ning a separate street that ran perpendicular to the front \ndoor, and had a large tree in the front corner of the \nproperty.  Id. at 6a-7a.  Guerra also observed a black \nCamaro in the driveway, which he would later use as a \nreference point to locate 3741 Landau Lane.  Id. at 7a.   \nUnbeknownst to Guerra and Lemoine, however, the \nGPS had directed them to a different home\u20143756 Den-\nville Trace, petitioners\u2019 residence.  Pet. App. 6a-7a.  Pe-\ntitioners\u2019 home at 3756 Denville Trace faces Landau \nLane and is a few houses (approximately 436 feet) from \n3741 Landau Lane.  Ibid.  The house number does not \nappear on the house itself; instead, it appears on the \nmailbox and is not visible from the street.  Id. at 7a.   \nThe same day\u2014and while it was still dark out\u2014\nGuerra, Lemoine, and other agents left for 3741 Landau \nLane in a caravan of vehicles.  Pet. App. 7a.  Guerra \nidentified what he believed to be 3741 Landau Lane \nbased on the black Camaro, his prior preparation, and \nthe morning drive-by.  Ibid.  He directed that his vehicle \nstop in front of the house, and the other vehicles fol-\nlowed suit.  Ibid.  The members of the SWAT team then \nassembled in their positions, and after Guerra knocked \n\n5 \n \nand announced the presence of law enforcement, agents \nentered the home.  Id. at 7a-8a.  \nThe agents were in the home for approximately five \nminutes before realizing their mistake.  Pet. App. 39a.  \nDuring that time, the SWAT team members found peti-\ntioners Hilliard Toi Cliatt and Curtrina Martin in a \ncloset, where Cliatt kept a shotgun for protection.  Id. \nat 3a, 8a.  With their guns pointed, agents pulled Cliatt \nout of the closet and placed him in handcuffs.  Id. at 8a.   \nA SWAT team member also pointed a gun at Martin \nwhile instructing her to keep her hands up.  Ibid.  Shortly \nafter detaining Cliatt, however, the officers realized \nthat they had entered the wrong house.  Ibid.  An agent \nimmediately lifted Cliatt from the ground and uncuffed \nhim.  Ibid.  Guerra advised petitioners that he would re-\nturn to explain what had happened.  Id. at 8a-9a.   \nThe agents promptly executed the search warrant at \n3741 Landau Lane, making an arrest of Riley as he at-\ntempted to flee.  Pet. App. 9a.  Once Riley and 3741 Lan-\ndau Lane were secured, Guerra returned to petitioners\u2019 \nhome, where he apologized, provided his business card \nand the name of his supervisor, documented the damage \nto the home, and advised petitioners that the FBI would \nhandle the damages repairs.  Ibid.  \n3. In September 2019, petitioners brought suit \nagainst the United States under the FTCA.  Pet. App. \n9a.  Petitioners raised several claims based on state tort \nlaw, including, as relevant here, negligence, negli-\ngent/intentional infliction of emotional distress, tres-\npass and interference with private property, false im-\nprisonment, and assault and battery.  Ibid.1  \n \n1  Petitioners also brought a claim against Guerra under Bivens v. \nSix Unknown Named Agents of Federal Bureau of Narcotics, 403 \n \n\n6 \n \nThe district court granted in part the government\u2019s \nmotion for summary judgment.  Pet. App. 34a-68a.  The \ncourt held that the discretionary function exception in \nthe FTCA barred petitioners\u2019 claims for negligence, \nnegligent/intentional infliction of emotional distress, \ntrespass and interference with private property.  Id. at \n58a.  The court denied summary judgment, however, \nwith respect to two claims\u2014for false imprisonment and \nfor assault and battery\u2014that involved torts listed in the \nlaw enforcement proviso.  Id. at 59a-60a.  The court ex-\nplained that under Eleventh Circuit precedent, claims \nthat implicate the law enforcement proviso may proceed \neven if the acts giving rise to the claim involve a discre-\ntionary function.  Ibid.; see Nguyen v. United States, \n556 F.3d 1244, 1256 (11th Cir. 2009).   \nUpon a motion for reconsideration, the district court \ngranted the government\u2019s motion for summary judg-\nment in full and dismissed the complaint.  Pet. App. 21a-\n32a.  In its reconsideration order, the court, applying \nrecent Eleventh Circuit precedent, held that the Su-\npremacy Clause of the Constitution precluded petition-\ners from bringing their false imprisonment and assault \nand battery claims against the United States.  Id. at \n26a-27a (citing Kordash v. United States, 51 F.4th 1289 \n(11th Cir. 2022)).   \n4. The court of appeals affirmed in an unpublished, \nper curiam decision.  See Pet. App. 2a-19a.   \nThe court of appeals first held that the discretionary \nfunction exception barred petitioners\u2019 claims for torts \n \nU.S. 388 (1971), alleging that Guerra\u2019s mistaken execution of the \nwarrant at their house had violated their Fourth Amendment rights.  \nPet. App. 9a.  The court of appeals affirmed the dismissal of that \nclaim on qualified immunity grounds.  Id. at 13a-15a.  Petitioners do \nnot seek review of that holding.  See Pet. 10 n.1.     \n\n7 \n \nthat were not listed in the law enforcement proviso, i.e., \n\u201ctrespass and interference with private property,     \nnegligent/intentional infliction of emotional distress, \nand negligence.\u201d  Pet. App. 17a.  The court explained \nthat the discretionary function exception to the FTCA \n\u201cexempts from liability state-tort claims arising from a \ngovernment official\u2019s performance of a duty or function \nthat involves discretion.\u201d  Id. at 16a.  And here, the court \nobserved, Guerra \u201cenjoyed discretion\u201d under FBI poli-\ncies as to how to prepare for the execution of the war-\nrant, and his decision was \u201c\u200a\u2018susceptible to policy analy-\nsis,\u2019\u200a\u201d id. at 17a-18a (quoting Mesa v. United States, 123 \nF.3d 1435, 1438 (11th Cir. 1997)).   \nThe court of appeals also affirmed the dismissal of \npetitioners\u2019 false imprisonment and assault and battery \nclaims.  The court held that the Supremacy Clause, \n\u201c[s]imilar to the discretionary function exception,\u201d \u201cen-\nsures that states do not impede or burden the execution \nof federal law.\u201d  Pet. App. 16a.  Under circuit precedent, \n\u201c[t]he government may invoke the Supremacy Clause \nagainst state-tort liability\u201d if it demonstrates that the \nofficial\u2019s acts (i) \u201c\u200a\u2018have some nexus with furthering fed-\neral policy\u2019\u200a\u201d and (ii) \u201c\u200a\u2018can reasonably be characterized \nas complying with the full range of federal law.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Id. at \n17a (quoting Kordash, 51 F.4th at 1293).  The court held \nthat Guerra\u2019s acts had a \u201c\u200a\u2018nexus with furthering federal \npolicy\u2019\u200a\u201d because there was \u201cno doubt that Guerra acted \nwithin the scope of his discretionary authority when he \nprepared for and executed the search warrant.\u201d  Id. at \n19a (citation omitted).  And the court concluded that \nGuerra\u2019s actions complied with the \u201cfull range\u201d of fed-\neral law because he did not \u201cviolate[] the Fourth Amend-\nment.\u201d  Ibid.  The court explained that \u201can officer who \nmakes \u2018reasonable effort[s] to ascertain and identify \n\n8 \n \nthe\u2019 target address of a valid search warrant complies \nwith the Fourth Amendment,\u201d and \u201cthe decisions that \nGuerra made,\u201d while mistaken, were the \u201ckind of rea-\nsonable mistakes that the Fourth Amendment contem-\nplates,\u201d as they involved the execution of \u201ca high-risk \nwarrant\u201d in a \u201crapidly-changing and dangerous situa-\ntion.\u201d  Id. at 13a-14a (citation omitted; brackets in orig-\ninal).   \nARGUMENT \nPetitioners contend (Pet. 23-34) that the court of ap-\npeals misapplied the discretionary function exception in \nSection 2680(a) to dismiss their claims for trespass, in-\nterference with private property, negligent/intentional \ninfliction of emotional distress, and negligence.  That \ncontention lacks merit.  The court of appeals correctly \nheld (Pet. App. 15a-18a) that the discretionary function \nexception barred those claims, and its factbound and \nnonprecedential decision is consistent with decisions of \nthis Court and other courts of appeals.   \nPetitioners further contend (Pet. 16-23) that the \ncourt of appeals erred in affirming the dismissal of their \nclaims for false imprisonment and assault and battery.  \nPetitioners correctly observe that the court\u2019s reasoning \nfor rejecting those claims differs from the approach of \nother circuits, but that disagreement did not affect the \nproper disposition of the case.  The court correctly held \nthat petitioners\u2019 claims are barred, and no court of ap-\npeals to have addressed the issue would have reached a \ndifferent result.  Accordingly, this Court\u2019s review is not \nwarranted.     \n1. The court of appeals correctly held that the dis-\ncretionary function exception to the FTCA bars peti-\ntioners\u2019 claims for trespass and interference with pri-\n\n9 \n \nvate property, negligent/intentional infliction of emo-\ntional distress, and negligence.  Insofar as petitioners \nchallenge that holding, they do so on fact-specific \ngrounds, and their effort to identify relevant disagree-\nments among the courts of appeals is without merit.      \n \na. The FTCA\u2019s discretionary function exception pro-\nvides that the United States\u2019 waiver of sovereign im-\nmunity does not apply to claims based on an employee\u2019s \n\u201cexercise or performance or the failure to exercise or \nperform a discretionary function or duty  * * *, whether \nor not the discretion involved be abused.\u201d  28 U.S.C. \n2680(a).  The exception serves to \u201cprevent judicial \u2018sec-\nond-guessing\u200a\u2019 of legislative and administrative deci-\nsions  * * *  through the medium of an action in tort.\u201d  \nUnited States v. Gaubert, 499 U.S. 315, 323 (1991) (cita-\ntion omitted).   \nThis Court has established a two-part inquiry to \nguide application of the discretionary function excep-\ntion.  Gaubert, 499 U.S. at 322-323.  First, a court must \ndetermine whether the conduct challenged by the plain-\ntiff was \u201cdiscretionary in nature\u201d\u2014that is, whether it \ninvolved \u201c\u200a\u2018an element of judgment or choice.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Id. at \n322 (citation omitted).  \u201cThe requirement of judgment \nor choice is not satisfied if a \u2018federal statute, regulation, \nor policy specifically prescribes a course of action for an \nemployee to follow,\u2019 because \u2018the employee has no right-\nful option but to adhere to the directive.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Ibid. (quot-\ning Berkovitz v. United States, 486 U.S. 531, 536 (1988)).  \nSecond, a court must evaluate \u201cwhether that judgment \nis of the kind that the discretionary function exception \nwas designed to shield,\u201d id. at 322-323 (quoting Berkovitz, \n486 U.S. at 536), meaning it is \u201csusceptible to policy \nanalysis,\u201d id. at 325. \n\n10 \n \nGuerra\u2019s conduct in executing the search warrant \nsatisfied the Gaubert standard.  As the court of appeals \nobserved, the FBI did not have policies that \u201cdictate[d] \nhow agents are to prepare for warrant executions,\u201d and \nGuerra instead exercised discretion as to how to inves-\ntigate the location.  Pet. App. 18a (emphasis omitted).  \nThat decision required judgment:  an agent must weigh, \namong other things, \u201cthe urgency of apprehending the \nsubject,\u201d the need to \u201ckeep the investigation secret,\u201d \nand \u201cavailable resources\u201d in allocating agents across \n\u201cthe many investigations for which they are responsi-\nble.\u201d  Mesa v. United States, 123 F.3d 1435, 1438 (11th \nCir. 1997).  Here, Guerra faced a \u201crapidly-changing and \ndangerous situation,\u201d Pet. App. 14a, and he exercised \ndiscretion to conduct his drive-by in the dark, with the \nheadlights dimmed, to \u201cavoid detection\u201d before execut-\ning a high-risk warrant, id. at 37a.  While Guerra did \nnot have discretion to intentionally \u201craid the wrong \nhouse,\u201d Pet. 31, he did have discretion in determining \nthe preparatory steps necessary to \u201clocate and identify\u201d \nthe target address,\u201d Pet. App. 18a.    \nGuerra\u2019s conduct likewise satisfied the second com-\nponent of Gaubert\u2019s two-part inquiry because his \u201cdeci-\nsion as to how to locate and identify the subject of an \narrest warrant  * * *  is susceptible to policy analysis.\u201d  \nPet. App. 18a (quoting Mesa, 123 F.3d at 1438).  The \nfactors described above\u2014which include competing con-\nsiderations like officer and public safety, resource con-\nstraints, tactical considerations, and accuracy\u2014are all \n\u201cfundamentally rooted in policy considerations,\u201d for which \n\u201cjudicial second-guessing\u201d is not appropriate.  Mesa, 123 \nF.3d at 1438.  The court of appeals therefore correctly \nheld that Guerra\u2019s preparatory efforts here \u201cf\u200a[e]ll \n\n11 \n \nsquarely within the discretionary function exception.\u201d  \nPet. App. 18a (citation omitted).  \nb. Petitioners briefly contend (Pet. 28-30) that the \ncourt of appeals erred in holding that Guerra\u2019s execu-\ntion of the warrant was \u201csusceptible to policy analysis\u201d \nand thus \u201c\u200a\u2018of the kind that the discretionary function \nexception was designed to shield.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Gaubert, 499 U.S. \nat 322-323, 325 (citation omitted).  In petitioners\u2019 view \n(Pet. 30), the proper inquiry asks whether a federal em-\nployee\u2019s acts \u201cactually\u201d\u2014\u201cnot just hypothetically\u201d\u2014\nwere grounded in policy analysis.   \nThis Court has long since rejected the subjective \nstandard that petitioners advocate.  In Gaubert, this \nCourt explained that the \u201cfocus of the inquiry is not on \nthe agent\u2019s subjective intent in exercising the discretion \nconferred by statute or regulation, but on the nature of \nthe actions taken.\u201d  499 U.S. at 325.  Thus, the relevant \nquestion is not how an officer thinks about his or her \nconduct; the question is whether the conduct is of the \n\u201ckind\u201d that, by its nature, can be \u201cgrounded in the pol-\nicy of the regulatory regime.\u201d  Ibid. (emphasis added).  \nConsistent with that approach, the Eleventh Circuit fo-\ncused on the nature of Guerra\u2019s conduct, explaining that \n\u201ca federal officer\u2019s \u2018decision as to how to locate and iden-\ntify the subject of an arrest warrant\u2019\u200a\u201d is the kind of act \nthat requires discretion.  Pet. App. 18a (quoting Mesa, \n123 F.3d at 1438).   \nContrary to petitioners\u2019 assertion (Pet. 28-30), the \ncourts of appeals are unanimous, not divided, in follow-\ning this Court\u2019s guidance.  Petitioners recognize that \nnine circuits have held that an official\u2019s act need \u201cnot be \nactually grounded in policy considerations,\u201d so long as it \nis, \u201cby its nature, susceptible to a policy analysis.\u201d  Pet. \n28 (quoting Miller v. United States, 163 F.3d 591, 593 \n\n12 \n \n(9th Cir. 1998)).  And contrary to petitioners\u2019 contention \n(Pet. 28-30), the Third Circuit likewise examines the \n\u201cnature of the actions taken,\u201d not the \u201csubjective in-\ntent\u201d of the agent.  Baer v. United States, 722 F.3d 168, \n175 (2013) (quoting Gaubert, 499 U.S. at 325) (emphasis \nomitted); see Middleton v. United States Fed. Bureau \nof Prisons, 658 Fed. Appx. 167, 169-170 (3d Cir. 2016) \n(per curiam) (concluding that task was susceptible to \npolicy analysis without considering whether officials ac-\ntually engaged in such analysis).  \nc. Petitioners also maintain that review is warranted \nto resolve two disagreements among the courts of ap-\npeal as to how the discretionary function exception ap-\nplies.  That contention is meritless.  To the extent any \ndisagreements exists among the courts of appeals, this \ncase does not implicate them.   \ni. Petitioners contend (Pet. 31-33) that the courts of \nappeals disagree on whether the discretionary function \nexception is applicable where a federal employee\u2019s con-\nduct runs afoul of the Constitution.  That question played \nno role in the court of appeals\u2019 decision.  The court held \nthat \u201cGuerra\u2019s actions did not violate the Fourth Amend-\nment.\u201d  Pet. App. 19a.  In particular, the Court concluded \nthat that Guerra\u2019s actions \u201cconstitute[d] the kind of rea-\nsonable mistakes that the Fourth Amendment contem-\nplates.\u201d  Id. at 14a.  Petitioners do not challenge that fact-\nbound determination, see Pet. i, and this case therefore \npresents no opportunity to resolve any differences \namong the courts of appeals as to the application of the \ndiscretionary function exception to unconstitutional \nconduct.2 \n \n2 Petitioners argue that the court of appeals spoke \u201cimprecise[ly]\u201d \nwhen it stated that \u201c\u200a\u2018Guerra\u2019s \n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

App. 2a-19a) \nis available at 2024 WL 1716235.  The order of the dis-\ntrict court (Pet. App. 21a-32a) is available at 2022 WL \n18263039.  A prior order of the district court (Pet. App. \n34a-68a) is reported at 631 F. Supp. 3d. 1281.  \nJURISDICTION \nThe judgment of the court of appeals was entered on \nApril 22, 2024.  A petition for rehearing was denied on \nMay 30, 2024. (Pet. App. 70a-71a).  On July 22, 2024, \nJustice Thomas extended the time within which to file a \npetition for a writ of certiorari to and including Septem-\nber 27, 2024, and the petition was filed on that day.  The \njurisdiction of this Court is invoked under 28 U.S.C. \n1254(1). \n\n2 \n \nSTATEMENT \n1. The Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA), 28 U.S.C. \n1346(b), 2671 et seq., enacted in 1946, generally waives \nthe sovereign immunity of the United States and cre-\nates a cause of action for damages against the United \nStates with respect to certain torts of federal employ-\nees, acting within the scope of their employment, under \ncircumstances in which a private individual would be li-\nable under state law.  See 28 U.S.C. 1346(b)(1).  The \nFTCA contains various exceptions that limit the waiver \nof sovereign immunity and the substantive scope of the \nUnited States\u2019 liability, including an exception for any \nclaim \u201cbased upon the exercise or performance or the \nfailure to exercise or perform a discretionary function \nor duty on the part of a federal agency or an employee \nof the Government, whether or not the discretion in-\nvolved be abused.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 2680(a).   \nThe FTCA also excludes from its waiver of sovereign \nimmunity most intentional torts:  \u201c[a]ny claim arising \nout of assault, battery, false imprisonment, false arrest, \nmalicious prosecution, abuse of process, libel, slander, \nmisrepresentation, deceit, or interference with contract \nrights.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 2680(h).  In 1974, Congress added a \nproviso to the intentional tort exception, known as the \nlaw enforcement proviso.  See Act of Mar. 16, 1974, Pub. \nL. No. 93-253, \u00a7 2, 88 Stat. 50.  The law enforcement \nproviso states that \u201cthe provisions of this chapter and \nsection 1346(b) of this title shall apply to any claim aris-\ning  * * *  out of assault, battery, false imprisonment, \nfalse arrest, abuse of process, or malicious prosecution\u201d \nthat is based on \u201cacts or omissions of investigative or \nlaw enforcement officers of the United States Govern-\nment.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 2680(h). \n\n3 \n \n2. In 2015, the Federal Bureau of Investigation \n(FBI) initiated an operation concerning violent gang ac-\ntivity in Georgia.  Pet. App. 4a.  The operation ultimately \nresulted in the criminal indictment of several individu-\nals, including Joseph Riley.  Id. at 3a-4a.  Officers ob-\ntained warrants for Riley\u2019s arrest and for the search of \nhis home at 3741 Landau Lane SW, Atlanta, Georgia \n30331.  Id. at 4a.     \nThe FBI assigned Special Agent Lawrence Guerra \nto lead a Special Weapons and Tactics (SWAT) team in \nthe execution of the search warrant.  Pet. App. 4a-5a.  \nThe FBI has a standard operating procedure that re-\nquires its agents to conduct a site survey or a drive-by \nbefore executing a high-risk warrant, such as the one \nfor Riley\u2019s arrest.  Id. at 5a.  The FBI, however, does \nnot have any policies that govern how to locate or navi-\ngate to a target address.  Ibid.   \nGuerra took several steps in preparation to execute \nthe warrant.  He reviewed information that other FBI \nagents had obtained through surveillance of Riley and \n3741 Landau Lane.  Pet. App. 4a-6a.  He conducted a \nsite survey of 3741 Landau Lane, during which he took \nphotographs and identified specific features of the home \nso that he could locate the property when executing the \nwarrant in the early morning.  Id. at 5a.  Guerra noted \nthat the house was beige and split-level, located on a \ncorner lot, had a driveway and garage facing a separate \nstreet that ran perpendicular to the front door, and had \na large tree in the front corner of the property.  Ibid.  \nGuerra also wrote tactical notes outlining how his team \nwould execute the warrant, and he attended an opera-\ntional briefing, which included presentations on and \nphotographs of Riley and 3741 Landau Lane.  Id. at 6a.  \n\n4 \n \nIn the pre-dawn hours of October 18, 2017, Guerra \nconducted a further drive-by with FBI Special Agent \nMichael Lemoine.  Pet. App. 4a, 6a.  Navigating in com-\nplete darkness, Guerra used his personal GPS device to \nlocate 3741 Landau Lane.  Ibid.  When the GPS unit \nalerted that they had arrived at 3741 Landau Lane, \nGuerra observed what he believed to be the same house \nhe had seen during his previous site survey: the home \nwas beige and split-level, located on a corner lot, had a \ntight stairway and stoop leading to the front door with \nwindows on either side, had a driveway and garage fac-\ning a separate street that ran perpendicular to the front \ndoor, and had a large tree in the front corner of the \nproperty.  Id. at 6a-7a.  Guerra also observed a black \nCamaro in the driveway, which he would later use as a \nreference point to locate 3741 Landau Lane.  Id. at 7a.   \nUnbeknownst to Guerra and Lemoine, however, the \nGPS had directed them to a different home\u20143756 Den-\nville Trace, petitioners\u2019 residence.  Pet. App. 6a-7a.  Pe-\ntitioners\u2019 home at 3756 Denville Trace faces Landau \nLane and is a few houses (approximately 436 feet) from \n3741 Landau Lane.  Ibid.  The house number does not \nappear on the house itself; instead, it appears on the \nmailbox and is not visible from the street.  Id. at 7a.   \nThe same day\u2014and while it was still dark out\u2014\nGuerra, Lemoine, and other agents left for 3741 Landau \nLane in a caravan of vehicles.  Pet. App. 7a.  Guerra \nidentified what he believed to be 3741 Landau Lane \nbased on the black Camaro, his prior preparation, and \nthe morning drive-by.  Ibid.  He directed that his vehicle \nstop in front of the house, and the other vehicles fol-\nlowed suit.  Ibid.  The members of the SWAT team then \nassembled in their positions, and after Guerra knocked \n\n5 \n \nand announced the presence of law enforcement, agents \nentered the home.  Id. at 7a-8a.  \nThe agents were in the home for approximately five \nminutes before realizing their mistake.  Pet. App. 39a.  \nDuring that time, the SWAT team members found peti-\ntioners Hilliard Toi Cliatt and Curtrina Martin in a \ncloset, where Cliatt kept a shotgun for protection.  Id. \nat 3a, 8a.  With their guns pointed, agents pulled Cliatt \nout of the closet and placed him in handcuffs.  Id. at 8a.   \nA SWAT team member also pointed a gun at Martin \nwhile instructing her to keep her hands up.  Ibid.  Shortly \nafter detaining Cliatt, however, the officers realized \nthat they had entered the wrong house.  Ibid.  An agent \nimmediately lifted Cliatt from the ground and uncuffed \nhim.  Ibid.  Guerra advised petitioners that he would re-\nturn to explain what had happened.  Id. at 8a-9a.   \nThe agents promptly executed the search warrant at \n3741 Landau Lane, making an arrest of Riley as he at-\ntempted to flee.  Pet. App. 9a.  Once Riley and 3741 Lan-\ndau Lane were secured, Guerra returned to petitioners\u2019 \nhome, where he apologized, provided his business card \nand the name of his supervisor, documented the damage \nto the home, and advised petitioners that the FBI would \nhandle the damages repairs.  Ibid.  \n3. In September 2019, petitioners brought suit \nagainst the United States under the FTCA.  Pet. App. \n9a.  Petitioners raised several claims based on state tort \nlaw, including, as relevant here, negligence, negli-\ngent/intentional infliction of emotional distress, tres-\npass and interference with private property, false im-\nprisonment, and assault and battery.  Ibid.1  \n \n1  Petitioners also brought a claim against Guerra under Bivens v. \nSix Unknown Named Agents of Federal Bureau of Narcotics, 403 \n \n\n6 \n \nThe district court granted in part the government\u2019s \nmotion for summary judgment.  Pet. App. 34a-68a.  The \ncourt held that the discretionary function exception in \nthe FTCA barred petitioners\u2019 claims for negligence, \nnegligent/intentional infliction of emotional distress, \ntrespass and interference with private property.  Id. at \n58a.  The court denied summary judgment, however, \nwith respect to two claims\u2014for false imprisonment and \nfor assault and battery\u2014that involved torts listed in the \nlaw enforcement proviso.  Id. at 59a-60a.  The court ex-\nplained that under Eleventh Circuit precedent, claims \nthat implicate the law enforcement proviso may proceed \neven if the acts giving rise to the claim involve a discre-\ntionary function.  Ibid.; see Nguyen v. United States, \n556 F.3d 1244, 1256 (11th Cir. 2009).   \nUpon a motion for reconsideration, the district court \ngranted the government\u2019s motion for summary judg-\nment in full and dismissed the complaint.  Pet. App. 21a-\n32a.  In its reconsideration order, the court, applying \nrecent Eleventh Circuit precedent, held that the Su-\npremacy Clause of the Constitution precluded petition-\ners from bringing their false imprisonment and assault \nand battery claims against the United States.  Id. at \n26a-27a (citing Kordash v. United States, 51 F.4th 1289 \n(11th Cir. 2022)).   \n4. The court of appeals affirmed in an unpublished, \nper curiam decision.  See Pet. App. 2a-19a.   \nThe court of appeals first held that the discretionary \nfunction exception barred petitioners\u2019 claims for torts \n \nU.S. 388 (1971), alleging that Guerra\u2019s mistaken execution of the \nwarrant at their house had violated their Fourth Amendment rights.  \nPet. App. 9a.  The court of appeals affirmed the dismissal of that \nclaim on qualified immunity grounds.  Id. at 13a-15a.  Petitioners do \nnot seek review of that holding.  See Pet. 10 n.1.     \n\n7 \n \nthat were not listed in the law enforcement proviso, i.e., \n\u201ctrespass and interference with private property,     \nnegligent/intentional infliction of emotional distress, \nand negligence.\u201d  Pet. App. 17a.  The court explained \nthat the discretionary function exception to the FTCA \n\u201cexempts from liability state-tort claims arising from a \ngovernment official\u2019s performance of a duty or function \nthat involves discretion.\u201d  Id. at 16a.  And here, the court \nobserved, Guerra \u201cenjoyed discretion\u201d under FBI poli-\ncies as to how to prepare for the execution of the war-\nrant, and his decision was \u201c\u200a\u2018susceptible to policy analy-\nsis,\u2019\u200a\u201d id. at 17a-18a (quoting Mesa v. United States, 123 \nF.3d 1435, 1438 (11th Cir. 1997)).   \nThe court of appeals also affirmed the dismissal of \npetitioners\u2019 false imprisonment and assault and battery \nclaims.  The court held that the Supremacy Clause, \n\u201c[s]imilar to the discretionary function exception,\u201d \u201cen-\nsures that states do not impede or burden the execution \nof federal law.\u201d  Pet. App. 16a.  Under circuit precedent, \n\u201c[t]he government may invoke the Supremacy Clause \nagainst state-tort liability\u201d if it demonstrates that the \nofficial\u2019s acts (i) \u201c\u200a\u2018have some nexus with furthering fed-\neral policy\u2019\u200a\u201d and (ii) \u201c\u200a\u2018can reasonably be characterized \nas complying with the full range of federal law.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Id. at \n17a (quoting Kordash, 51 F.4th at 1293).  The court held \nthat Guerra\u2019s acts had a \u201c\u200a\u2018nexus with furthering federal \npolicy\u2019\u200a\u201d because there was \u201cno doubt that Guerra acted \nwithin the scope of his discretionary authority when he \nprepared for and executed the search warrant.\u201d  Id. at \n19a (citation omitted).  And the court concluded that \nGuerra\u2019s actions complied with the \u201cfull range\u201d of fed-\neral law because he did not \u201cviolate[] the Fourth Amend-\nment.\u201d  Ibid.  The court explained that \u201can officer who \nmakes \u2018reasonable effort[s] to ascertain and identify \n\n8 \n \nthe\u2019 target address of a valid search warrant complies \nwith the Fourth Amendment,\u201d and \u201cthe decisions that \nGuerra made,\u201d while mistaken, were the \u201ckind of rea-\nsonable mistakes that the Fourth Amendment contem-\nplates,\u201d as they involved the execution of \u201ca high-risk \nwarrant\u201d in a \u201crapidly-changing and dangerous situa-\ntion.\u201d  Id. at 13a-14a (citation omitted; brackets in orig-\ninal).   \nARGUMENT \nPetitioners contend (Pet. 23-34) that the court of ap-\npeals misapplied the discretionary function exception in \nSection 2680(a) to dismiss their claims for trespass, in-\nterference with private property, negligent/intentional \ninfliction of emotional distress, and negligence.  That \ncontention lacks merit.  The court of appeals correctly \nheld (Pet. App. 15a-18a) that the discretionary function \nexception barred those claims, and its factbound and \nnonprecedential decision is consistent with decisions of \nthis Court and other courts of appeals.   \nPetitioners further contend (Pet. 16-23) that the \ncourt of appeals erred in affirming the dismissal of their \nclaims for false imprisonment and assault and battery.  \nPetitioners correctly observe that the court\u2019s reasoning \nfor rejecting those claims differs from the approach of \nother circuits, but that disagreement did not affect the \nproper disposition of the case.  The court correctly held \nthat petitioners\u2019 claims are barred, and no court of ap-\npeals to have addressed the issue would have reached a \ndifferent result.  Accordingly, this Court\u2019s review is not \nwarranted.     \n1. The court of appeals correctly held that the dis-\ncretionary function exception to the FTCA bars peti-\ntioners\u2019 claims for trespass and interference with pri-\n\n9 \n \nvate property, negligent/intentional infliction of emo-\ntional distress, and negligence.  Insofar as petitioners \nchallenge that holding, they do so on fact-specific \ngrounds, and their effort to identify relevant disagree-\nments among the courts of appeals is without merit.      \n \na. The FTCA\u2019s discretionary function exception pro-\nvides that the United States\u2019 waiver of sovereign im-\nmunity does not apply to claims based on an employee\u2019s \n\u201cexercise or performance or the failure to exercise or \nperform a discretionary function or duty  * * *, whether \nor not the discretion involved be abused.\u201d  28 U.S.C. \n2680(a).  The exception serves to \u201cprevent judicial \u2018sec-\nond-guessing\u200a\u2019 of legislative and administrative deci-\nsions  * * *  through the medium of an action in tort.\u201d  \nUnited States v. Gaubert, 499 U.S. 315, 323 (1991) (cita-\ntion omitted).   \nThis Court has established a two-part inquiry to \nguide application of the discretionary function excep-\ntion.  Gaubert, 499 U.S. at 322-323.  First, a court must \ndetermine whether the conduct challenged by the plain-\ntiff was \u201cdiscretionary in nature\u201d\u2014that is, whether it \ninvolved \u201c\u200a\u2018an element of judgment or choice.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Id. at \n322 (citation omitted).  \u201cThe requirement of judgment \nor choice is not satisfied if a \u2018federal statute, regulation, \nor policy specifically prescribes a course of action for an \nemployee to follow,\u2019 because \u2018the employee has no right-\nful option but to adhere to the directive.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Ibid. (quot-\ning Berkovitz v. United States, 486 U.S. 531, 536 (1988)).  \nSecond, a court must evaluate \u201cwhether that judgment \nis of the kind that the discretionary function exception \nwas designed to shield,\u201d id. at 322-323 (quoting Berkovitz, \n486 U.S. at 536), meaning it is \u201csusceptible to policy \nanalysis,\u201d id. at 325. \n\n10 \n \nGuerra\u2019s conduct in executing the search warrant \nsatisfied the Gaubert standard.  As the court of appeals \nobserved, the FBI did not have policies that \u201cdictate[d] \nhow agents are to prepare for warrant executions,\u201d and \nGuerra instead exercised discretion as to how to inves-\ntigate the location.  Pet. App. 18a (emphasis omitted).  \nThat decision required judgment:  an agent must weigh, \namong other things, \u201cthe urgency of apprehending the \nsubject,\u201d the need to \u201ckeep the investigation secret,\u201d \nand \u201cavailable resources\u201d in allocating agents across \n\u201cthe many investigations for which they are responsi-\nble.\u201d  Mesa v. United States, 123 F.3d 1435, 1438 (11th \nCir. 1997).  Here, Guerra faced a \u201crapidly-changing and \ndangerous situation,\u201d Pet. App. 14a, and he exercised \ndiscretion to conduct his drive-by in the dark, with the \nheadlights dimmed, to \u201cavoid detection\u201d before execut-\ning a high-risk warrant, id. at 37a.  While Guerra did \nnot have discretion to intentionally \u201craid the wrong \nhouse,\u201d Pet. 31, he did have discretion in determining \nthe preparatory steps necessary to \u201clocate and identify\u201d \nthe target address,\u201d Pet. App. 18a.    \nGuerra\u2019s conduct likewise satisfied the second com-\nponent of Gaubert\u2019s two-part inquiry because his \u201cdeci-\nsion as to how to locate and identify the subject of an \narrest warrant  * * *  is susceptible to policy analysis.\u201d  \nPet. App. 18a (quoting Mesa, 123 F.3d at 1438).  The \nfactors described above\u2014which include competing con-\nsiderations like officer and public safety, resource con-\nstraints, tactical considerations, and accuracy\u2014are all \n\u201cfundamentally rooted in policy considerations,\u201d for which \n\u201cjudicial second-guessing\u201d is not appropriate.  Mesa, 123 \nF.3d at 1438.  The court of appeals therefore correctly \nheld that Guerra\u2019s preparatory efforts here \u201cf\u200a[e]ll \n\n11 \n \nsquarely within the discretionary function exception.\u201d  \nPet. App. 18a (citation omitted).  \nb. Petitioners briefly contend (Pet. 28-30) that the \ncourt of appeals erred in holding that Guerra\u2019s execu-\ntion of the warrant was \u201csusceptible to policy analysis\u201d \nand thus \u201c\u200a\u2018of the kind that the discretionary function \nexception was designed to shield.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Gaubert, 499 U.S. \nat 322-323, 325 (citation omitted).  In petitioners\u2019 view \n(Pet. 30), the proper inquiry asks whether a federal em-\nployee\u2019s acts \u201cactually\u201d\u2014\u201cnot just hypothetically\u201d\u2014\nwere grounded in policy analysis.   \nThis Court has long since rejected the subjective \nstandard that petitioners advocate.  In Gaubert, this \nCourt explained that the \u201cfocus of the inquiry is not on \nthe agent\u2019s subjective intent in exercising the discretion \nconferred by statute or regulation, but on the nature of \nthe actions taken.\u201d  499 U.S. at 325.  Thus, the relevant \nquestion is not how an officer thinks about his or her \nconduct; the question is whether the conduct is of the \n\u201ckind\u201d that, by its nature, can be \u201cgrounded in the pol-\nicy of the regulatory regime.\u201d  Ibid. (emphasis added).  \nConsistent with that approach, the Eleventh Circuit fo-\ncused on the nature of Guerra\u2019s conduct, explaining that \n\u201ca federal officer\u2019s \u2018decision as to how to locate and iden-\ntify the subject of an arrest warrant\u2019\u200a\u201d is the kind of act \nthat requires discretion.  Pet. App. 18a (quoting Mesa, \n123 F.3d at 1438).   \nContrary to petitioners\u2019 assertion (Pet. 28-30), the \ncourts of appeals are unanimous, not divided, in follow-\ning this Court\u2019s guidance.  Petitioners recognize that \nnine circuits have held that an official\u2019s act need \u201cnot be \nactually grounded in policy considerations,\u201d so long as it \nis, \u201cby its nature, susceptible to a policy analysis.\u201d  Pet. \n28 (quoting Miller v. United States, 163 F.3d 591, 593 \n\n12 \n \n(9th Cir. 1998)).  And contrary to petitioners\u2019 contention \n(Pet. 28-30), the Third Circuit likewise examines the \n\u201cnature of the actions taken,\u201d not the \u201csubjective in-\ntent\u201d of the agent.  Baer v. United States, 722 F.3d 168, \n175 (2013) (quoting Gaubert, 499 U.S. at 325) (emphasis \nomitted); see Middleton v. United States Fed. Bureau \nof Prisons, 658 Fed. Appx. 167, 169-170 (3d Cir. 2016) \n(per curiam) (concluding that task was susceptible to \npolicy analysis without considering whether officials ac-\ntually engaged in such analysis).  \nc. Petitioners also maintain that review is warranted \nto resolve two disagreements among the courts of ap-\npeal as to how the discretionary function exception ap-\nplies.  That contention is meritless.  To the extent any \ndisagreements exists among the courts of appeals, this \ncase does not implicate them.   \ni. Petitioners contend (Pet. 31-33) that the courts of \nappeals disagree on whether the discretionary function \nexception is applicable where a federal employee\u2019s con-\nduct runs afoul of the Constitution.  That question played \nno role in the court of appeals\u2019 decision.  The court held \nthat \u201cGuerra\u2019s actions did not violate the Fourth Amend-\nment.\u201d  Pet. App. 19a.  In particular, the Court concluded \nthat that Guerra\u2019s actions \u201cconstitute[d] the kind of rea-\nsonable mistakes that the Fourth Amendment contem-\nplates.\u201d  Id. at 14a.  Petitioners do not challenge that fact-\nbound determination, see Pet. i, and this case therefore \npresents no opportunity to resolve any differences \namong the courts of appeals as to the application of the \ndiscretionary function exception to unconstitutional \nconduct.2 \n \n2 Petitioners argue that the court of appeals spoke \u201cimprecise[ly]\u201d \nwhen it stated that \u201c\u200a\u2018Guerra\u2019s actions did not violate the Fourth \n \n\n13 \n \nPetitioners also overstate the extent of disagree-\nment on that question.  The government agrees that a \nconstitutional mandate, no less than a federal statu-\ntory or regulatory one, can eliminate a government of-\nficial\u2019s discretion when it is sufficiently specific or when \nan authoritative construction and application with suffi-\ncient specificity was clearly established before the of-\nficer acted.  Many of the cases that petitioners cite are \nconsistent with that position, as the government ex-\nplained in its brief in opposition (at 8-11) in Shivers v. \nUnited States, 142 S. Ct. 1361 (2022) (No. 21-682).3  And this \nCourt has repeatedly denied petitions for writs of certiorari \nraising similar issues.  See ibid.; Linder v. United States, \n141 S. Ct. 159 (2020) (No. 19-1082); Chaidez Campos v. \nUnited States, 139 S. Ct. 1317 (2019) (No. 18-234); Cas-\ntro v. United States, 562 U.S. 1168 (2011) (No. 10-309); \nWelch v. United States, 546 U.S. 1214 (2006) (No. 05-\n529).   \n \nAmendment,\u2019\u200a\u201d and instead held only that Guerra\u2019s actions did not \nviolate \u201c\u200a\u2018clearly established law,\u2019\u200a\u201d without reaching the question of \nwhether there was a violation of substantive Fourth Amendment \nlaw.  Pet. 13 n.4 (citations omitted); see Pet. 32-33.  That is incorrect.  \nIn addition to \u201cdetermin[ing] whether [Guerra\u2019s] actions violated \nthe Fourth Amendment\u201d in its qualified immunity analysis, the \ncourt also considered as part of its Supremacy Clause analysis \nwhether Guerra \u201ccomplied with the full range of the Fourth Amend-\nment.\u201d  Pet. App. 19a; see id. at 17a (describing inquiry \u201c[w]hen \nfaced with the determination whether the actions a law enforcement \nofficer took comply with the Fourth Amendment\u201d).  It concluded \nthat Guerra\u2019s actions did so.  Id. at 19a.   \n3  After the government\u2019s filing in Shivers, the First Circuit held \nthat constitutional violations may preclude application of the discre-\ntionary function exception even if the violation in question was not \nclearly established.  See Torres-Estrada v. Cases, 88 F.4th 14, 20-23 \n(2023).    \n\n14 \n \nii. This case also does not implicate any conflict \namong the courts of appeals as to whether \u201ccareless acts\u201d \nfall outside the discretionary function exception.  See Pet. \n34.  As petitioners acknowledge (ibid.), the Eleventh Cir-\ncuit has not addressed that question, and it had no oc-\ncasion to do so in this case.  Petitioners did not argue in \nthe court of appeals that Guerra had acted carelessly.  \nSee Pet. C.A. Br. 34-53.  And the court did not treat his \nacts as careless; on the contrary, it recognized that \nGuerra took \u201creasonable\u201d steps to correctly identify the \ntarget of the search warrant and simply made a mistake \nin the \u201crapidly-changing and dangerous situation of exe-\ncuting a high-risk warrant at night.\u201d  Pet. App. 14a.  \nThis case therefore would come out no differently re-\ngardless of whether careless acts fall outside the discre-\ntionary function exception.    \n2. The court of appeals also correctly affirmed the \ndistrict court\u2019s dismissal of petitioners\u2019 claims for false \nimprisonment and assault and battery.  Those claims \nare barred by the discretionary function exception, the \nsame as petitioners\u2019 other state-law tort claims.  Every \nother court of appeals to consider the issue would have \nresolved this case in the United States\u2019 favor on that ba-\nsis.  While the Eleventh Circuit used a different ra-\ntionale to reach the same result, that methodological \ndisagreement makes no practical difference and does \nnot warrant this Court\u2019s review.   \na. For the same reason that petitioners\u2019 other tort \nclaims cannot proceed, see pp. 8-12, supra, the discre-\ntionary function exception precludes petitioners\u2019 claims \nfor false imprisonment and assault and battery.  In ar-\nguing otherwise, petitioners suggest (Pet. 26-27) that \nthe exception is categorically inapplicable to torts listed \n\n15 \n \nin the law enforcement proviso of Section 2680(h).  That \nis wrong.  \ni. \u201c[A] waiver of the Government\u2019s sovereign im-\nmunity will be strictly construed, in terms of its scope, \nin favor of the sovereign.\u201d  Lane v. Pena, 518 U.S. 187, \n192 (1996).  When Congress enacted the law enforce-\nment proviso in 1974, it placed the proviso within the \nintentional tort exception, Section 2680(h), and thereby \nmodified that particular exception to the FTCA.  Al-\nthough provisos sometimes have a broader import, it is \ncustomary to use a proviso to refer only to things cov-\nered by the preceding clause.  See United States v. Mor-\nrow, 266 U.S. 531, 535 (1925) (\u201c[T]he presumption is \nthat, in accordance with its primary purpose, [a proviso] \nrefers only to the provision to which it is attached.\u201d); \nAntonin Scalia & Bryan A. Garner, Reading Law:  In-\nterpretation of Legal Texts 154 (2012) (\u201cA proviso con-\nditions the principal matter that it qualifies\u2014almost al-\nways the matter immediately preceding.\u201d).  Here, the \ntext, structure, and history of Section 2680 all strongly \nreinforce the conclusion that the law enforcement pro-\nviso has the customary scope of modifying only the pre-\nceding clause. \nSignificantly, Congress did not make the law en-\nforcement proviso an amendment to any of the other ex-\nceptions in Section 2680, such as the discretionary func-\ntion exception, which it could have done if it had in-\ntended to modify those preexisting exceptions as well.  \nAnd the conclusion that the proviso relates only to the \npreceding clause of subsection (h) is reinforced by the \nproviso\u2019s reference specifically to some (but not all) of \nthe intentional torts excepted in that prior clause.  See \n28 U.S.C. 2680(h) (\u201cProvided, That, with regard to acts \n\n16 \n \nor omissions of investigative or law enforcement offic-\ners of the United States,\u201d the FTCA \u201cshall apply\u201d to \nclaims alleging one of the select named intentional \ntorts.).  Moreover, the final sentence of Section 2680(h) \nfurnishes, \u201c[f]or the purpose of this subsection,\u201d a defi-\nnition of the term \u201c\u200a\u2018investigative or law enforcement of-\nficer.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Ibid. (emphasis added).  Because that term ap-\npears only in the law enforcement proviso, the final sen-\ntence in subsection (h) thereby links the proviso exclu-\nsively to the intentional tort exception in \u201cthis subsec-\ntion\u201d in that additional way as well.  Ibid. \nFurther still, the law enforcement proviso expressly \nstates that \u201cthe provisions of [Chapter 171  * * *  shall \napply\u201d to claims described within the proviso, 28 U.S.C. \n2680(h) (emphasis added), and the discretionary func-\ntion exception in 28 U.S.C. 2680(a) is one of the provi-\nsions of Chapter 171.  See Simmons v. Himmelreich, \n578 U.S. 621, 627 (2016) (interpreting the FTCA and \nholding that, \u201c[a]bsent persuasive indications to the \ncontrary,\u201d the Court will \u201cpresume Congress says what \nit means and means what it says\u201d).  Given the text and \nplacement of the law enforcement proviso in the statute, \nthe proviso is properly read as a modification only of the \nfirst clause of Section 2680(h)\u2014the clause excepting al-\ntogether certain intentional torts from the FTCA. \nA broader reading of the law enforcement proviso\u2014\nas a limitation not only upon the intentional tort excep-\ntion but also upon the other exceptions in Section \n2680\u2014would allow tort suits against the United States \nthat Congress plainly intended to bar.  Under petition-\ners\u2019 interpretation, a plaintiff alleging an intentional \ntort with respect to acts or omissions of law enforce-\nment officers could bring an FTCA claim arising in a \nforeign country notwithstanding 28 U.S.C. 2680(k), \n\n17 \n \nwhich prohibits all tort claims \u201carising in a foreign coun-\ntry.\u201d  See Sosa v. Alvarez-Machain, 542 U.S. 692, 699-712 \n(2004) (holding that foreign country exception barred \nFTCA claim for false arrest).  The language and struc-\nture of Section 2680 as a whole therefore do not support \nthe counterintuitive suggestion that Congress intended \nto override foundational compromises in the FTCA and \npermit suits arising abroad, or from discretionary func-\ntions, simply because the plaintiff\u2019s claim involves an al-\nleged tort by a law enforcement officer.  \nii. Notwithstanding the plain text of the statute, pe-\ntitioners (Pet. 26-27) and their amici (Members of Con-\ngress Amici Br. 4-13) contend that the government\u2019s po-\nsition conflicts with Congress\u2019s purpose in enacting the \nlaw enforcement proviso.  As this Court has recognized, \nit must \u201cfollow the text even if doing so will supposedly \nundercut a basic objective of the statute.\u201d  Baker Botts \nL.L.P. v. ASARCO LLC, 576 U.S. 121, 135 (2015) (cita-\ntion and internal quotation marks omitted).  But here, \nthe history and context of the law enforcement proviso \nreinforce that it was not intended to negate the discre-\ntionary function exception.  \nCongress adopted the proviso \u201cas a counterpart to \nthe Bivens case and its progen[y], in that it waives the \ndefense of sovereign immunity so as to make the Gov-\nernment independently liable in damages for the same \ntype of conduct that is alleged to have occurred in \nBivens.\u201d  Carlson v. Green, 446 U.S. 14, 20 (1980) (quot-\ning S. Rep. No. 588, 93d Cong., 1st Sess. 3 (1973) (Sen-\nate Report)).  Defendants in Bivens actions are entitled \nto immunity when their actions do not violate clearly es-\ntablished constitutional proscriptions, Harlow v. Fitz-\ngerald, 457 U.S. 800, 813-819 (1982), and as noted above, \n\n18 \n \nthat same kind of immunity is incorporated into the dis-\ncretionary function exception, see p. 13, supra.  The ap-\nplication of the discretionary function exception to con-\nduct covered by the law enforcement proviso thus is \nconsistent with the FTCA serving as a counterpart to \nBivens.  See Carlson, 446 U.S. at 19-20 (\u201c[T]he congres-\nsional comments accompanying [the law enforcement \nproviso in Section 2680(h)] made it crystal clear that \nCongress views FTCA and Bivens as parallel, comple-\nmentary causes of action.\u201d). \nThe construction of the law enforcement proviso and \ndiscretionary function exception advanced by the gov-\nernment therefore best gives effect to every provision \nof the statute and does not leave the law enforcement \nproviso without effect.  To start, many claims arising \nfrom the intentional torts of law enforcement officers do \nnot implicate discretionary functions at all.  See, e.g., \nLinder v. United States, 937 F.3d 1087, 1091 (7th Cir. \n2019), cert. denied, 141 S. Ct. 159 (2020) (explaining that \nit is clearly established that law enforcement officers do \nnot have discretion to commit perjury).  Likewise, the \nUnited States will not be shielded by the discretionary \nfunction exception under the FTCA for the conduct of \nfederal law enforcement officers if they act in violation \nof a clearly established constitutional, statutory, or reg-\nulatory directive, just as individual officers are not en-\ntitled to qualified immunity under Bivens when they vi-\nolate clearly established law.   \nThe law enforcement proviso accordingly retains full \nforce when law enforcement officers \u201cact in bad faith or \nwithout legal justification,\u201d including when they con-\nduct the type of \u201craids\u201d that Congress intended the law \nenforcement proviso to deter.  Senate Report 3.  Congress \nadded the proviso to create a cause of action for \u201cthe \n\n19 \n \nsame type of conduct that [wa]s alleged to have oc-\ncurred in Bivens,\u201d Carlson, 446 U.S. at 20 (quoting Sen-\nate Report 3)\u2014i.e., the raid of a home \u201cwithout cause, \nconsent or warrant,\u201d Bivens v. Six Unknown Named \nAgents of Fed. Bureau of Narcotics, 403 U.S. 388, 390 \nn.1 (1971) (citation omitted).  That also was true of the \nCollinsville raids that petitioners cite (Pet. 26) as the \nbasis for the law enforcement proviso.  Those \u201c\u200a\u2018no-knock\u2019 \nraids  * * *  into two different homes,\u201d involving the \n\u201csame Justice Department agents,\u201d were conducted \n\u201cwithout warrants\u201d and in an \u201cabusive\u201d fashion.  Senate \nReport 2-3 (emphasis added).  This case\u2014involving an \nofficer\u2019s \u201creasonable mistakes\u201d when \u201cexecuting a high-\nrisk warrant\u201d in a \u201crapidly-changing and dangerous sit-\nuation\u201d\u2014bears no resemblance to those warrantless \nraids.  Pet. App. 14a.   \nb. As petitioners acknowledge (Pet. 25), every court \nof appeals\u2014except the Eleventh Circuit\u2014to consider \nthe issue has held that the discretionary function excep-\ntion applies to the tort claims listed in the law enforce-\nment proviso in Section 2680(h).  See Linder, 937 F.3d \nat 1088-1089 (rejecting argument that the law enforce-\nment \u201cproviso overrides the rest of [Section] 2680\u201d); \nJoiner v. United States, 955 F.3d 399, 406 (5th Cir. \n2020) (\u201c[T]he law enforcement proviso does not negate \nthe discretionary function exception.\u201d); Medina v. \nUnited States, 259 F.3d 220, 228-229 (4th Cir. 2001) \n(where the discretionary function exception applies, it \ncontrols, even if the plaintiff alleges intentional torts \nwithin the law enforcement proviso); Gray v. Bell, 712 \nF.2d 490, 507-508 (D.C. Cir. 1983) (same), cert. denied, \n465 U.S. 1100 (1984); Caban v. United States, 671 F.2d \n1230, 1234 (2d Cir. 1982) (law enforcement proviso must \n\n20 \n \nbe read in conjunction with discretionary function ex-\nception); see also Gasho v. United States, 39 F.3d 1420, \n1433-1434 (9th Cir. 1994) (where the FTCA exception in \n28 U.S.C. 2680(c) applies, that exception controls not-\nwithstanding the law enforcement proviso), cert. de-\nnied, 515 U.S. 1144 (1995).  Because Guerra\u2019s conduct \nfalls within the discretionary function exception, see pp. \n8-12, supra, every other court of appeals would have up-\nheld the district court\u2019s judgment on that basis.    \nc. The court of appeals affirmed the district court\u2019s \njudgment on a different rationale.  The court of appeals \nstated that there was \u201cno doubt that Guerra acted \nwithin the scope of his discretionary authority when he \nprepared for and executed the search warrant.\u201d  Pet. \nApp. at 19a.  The court was bound, however, by circuit \nprecedent holding that torts listed in the law enforce-\nment proviso fall outside the scope of the discretionary \nfunction exception.  See Nguyen v. United States, 556 \nF.3d 1244, 1256 (11th Cir. 2009).  The court therefore \naffirmed dismissal of petitioners\u2019 false imprisonment \nand assault and battery claims on different grounds:  It \napplied other circuit precedent holding that, \u201c[s]imilar \nto the discretionary function exception, the Supremacy \nClause ensures that states do not impede or burden the \nexecution of federal law.\u201d  Pet. App. 16a (citing Denson \nv. United States, 574 F.3d 1318, 1336-1337 (11th Cir. \n2009), cert. denied, 560 U.S. 952 (2010)).  \nThe court of appeals\u2019 premise is sound.  Congress could \nnot have intended that the United States would be held \nliable for the actions of its law enforcement officers that \nare discretionary and within the scope of their official \nduties, because such conduct would ordinarily be privi-\nleged.  For the reasons explained above, however, that \nprotection for the actions of law enforcement officers is \n\n21 \n \nlocated in the FTCA itself, with no need to consider the \nSupremacy Clause.  See pp. 14-19, supra.  Although the \ncourt did not analyze the issue in that way, any error is \nirrelevant to the proper disposition of this case.  As ex-\nplained above, petitioners\u2019 claims must fail because they \narise out of Guerra\u2019s exercise of a discretionary func-\ntion.  See pp. 8-12, supra.   \nNor does the disagreement between the Eleventh \nCircuit and the other courts of appeals regarding the \ninterplay of the discretionary function exception and \nthe law enforcement proviso warrant this Court\u2019s re-\nview.  The Eleventh Circuit \u201cstands alone\u201d in holding \nthat the discretionary function exception is inapplicable \nto the torts listed in the law enforcement proviso.  \nLinder, 937 F.3d at 1089.  But the decision below rests \non the same fundamental insight as the other courts of \nappeals:  The United States cannot face liability for the \nacts of a law enforcement officer who \u201cacted within the \nscope of his discretionary authority.\u201d  Pet. App. 17a.  \nThus, the disagreement as to methodology has little \npractical significance, and the Court has previously de-\nnied petitions implicating the disagreement.  See \nLinder, 141 S. Ct. at 159; Denson v. United States, 560 \nU.S. 952, 952 (2010).  The same result is warranted here. \nd. If the Court were to grant a writ of certiorari to \nreview the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s application of the Su-\npremacy Clause to bar certain FTCA claims, it should \nalso direct the parties to address an additional question:  \nWhether the discretionary function exception is cate-\ngorically inapplicable to claims arising under the law \nenforcement proviso to the intentional torts exception.  \nAs petitioners acknowledge (Pet. 25), the court of ap-\npeals reached the constitutional question only because \nit could not address the statutory question under circuit \n\n22 \n \nlaw.  Resolving that threshold question is therefore nec-\nessary to a proper construction of the FTCA.  And, as \nthe other courts of appeals to address the question have \nrecognized, there is no sound basis for holding that a \nclaim falls outside the scope of the discretionary func-\ntion exception just because it is not separately barred \nby the enumerated torts exception.  For the reasons \ngiven above, however, the Court should deny the peti-\ntion for a writ of certiorari.   \nCONCLUSION \nThe petition for a writ of certiorari should be denied.  \nRespectfully submitted. \n \n \nELIZABETH B.

This document confirms my previous deductions about the case's posture and provides a clear roadmap of the petitioners' legal strategy, sharpening my predictive model for the case's outcome.\n\n1.  **Case Status (Confirmed):** The petitioners' brief confirms a cert grant date of January 27, 2025. This validates my prior synthesis, which correctly resolved conflicting signals and established that the case is on the merits.\n\n2.  **Legal Questions & Argumentative Priority (Sharpened):** The brief confirms the two questions before the Court. Crucially, it reveals the petitioners' strategic priorities through the structure of their argument.\n    *   **Primary Battleground (Statutory Interpretation):** Petitioners lead with and dedicate the vast majority of their brief (Argument I, pp. 19-47) to the question of whether the discretionary function exception (\u00a7 2680(a)) is categorically inapplicable to claims under the law enforcement proviso (\u00a7 2680(h)). This confirms my assessment that this is the decisive issue.\n    *   **Secondary Issue (Supremacy Clause):** The Supremacy Clause argument is presented second and is significantly shorter (Argument II, pp. 47-51), framed as a straightforward refutation of the Eleventh Circuit's \"paradoxical\" reasoning.\n\n3.  **Petitioners' Substantive Arguments (Detailed):** I now have a granular view of the petitioners' legal theory.\n    *   **On the Statutory Question (Argument I):** Their argument is a robust, two-pronged attack:\n        *   **No Conflict Exists:** They argue the two provisions are \"categorically distinct.\" The discretionary function exception (\u00a7 2680(a)) applies to policy-based judgments, whereas the law enforcement proviso (\u00a7 2680(h)) applies to common-law torts (assault, battery) which are, by nature, not exercises of policy discretion. They argue the lower courts have improperly expanded the discretionary exception to create a conflict where Congress intended none.\n        *   **If Conflict Exists, Proviso Prevails:** As a fallback, they argue that if the provisions *do* conflict, the law enforcement proviso must prevail. They will likely rely on canons of statutory construction, such as the specific governing the general, or the later-enacted statute clarifying the earlier one. They explicitly cite the Eleventh Circuit's own precedent in *Nguyen v. United States* as the correct application of this logic.\n    *   **On the Supremacy Clause Question (Argument II):** Their argument is simple and direct: the Supremacy Clause cannot bar a claim brought under a federal statute (the FTCA) against the federal government. The clause is meant to ensure federal law trumps state law, not to have federal law defeat itself.\n\n4.  **Predictive Model (Updated):**\n    *   **On the Supremacy Clause Question:** My confidence in a **reversal** of the Eleventh Circuit on this question is now extremely high. The combination of the government abandoning this argument and the petitioners' straightforward, powerful refutation makes any other outcome highly improbable. The Court will likely use this point to correct a clear error.\n    *   **On the Statutory Interpretation Question:** This remains the core uncertainty, but the petitioners' brief strengthens their position. Their dual-pronged argument is logically sound and rooted in textual analysis, legislative history (linking the proviso to historical \"no-knock\" raid abuses), and separation-of-powers principles. My prediction shifts from \"tempered\" to **cautiously optimistic for a petitioner victory** on this question. They have presented a compelling case that their interpretation is necessary to give any real meaning to the law enforcement proviso. The final outcome, however, still hinges on the government's forthcoming counterarguments.",
          "design_beliefs": "This observation has reinforced several core methodological principles and added new, more sophisticated heuristics for legal analysis, particularly regarding the interpretation of primary source legal documents.\n\n1.  **Internal Consistency Checking (Validated & Refined):** This remains a cornerstone principle. The cycle of detecting a contradiction, prioritizing its resolution, and achieving a stable belief state has proven highly effective. The refined principle is: **The research cycle must include a continuous background check for internal consistency. When a contradiction is detected, all other goals are subordinated to resolving it, as it points to the area of maximum uncertainty and potential information gain.**\n\n2.  **Metadata is Evidentiary (Reinforced):** Scrutinizing document titles (\"Brief in Opposition,\" \"Motion for Divided Argument\") and filenames was critical for reconstructing the procedural timeline accurately and efficiently.\n\n3.  **Map Arguments to Procedural Stage (Refined):** A party's cert-stage arguments are strong signals of their merits strategy. The government's weak defense of one issue at the cert stage was a clear signal of a strategic pivot, which has now been confirmed.\n\n4.  **Prioritize Primary Sources (Reinforced):** Direct access to primary source docket files (like this merits brief) is indispensable. It provides not only the substance of an argument but also its strategic framing, emphasis, and structure\u2014meta-information that is often lost in secondary summaries.\n\n5.  **The \"Amicus in Support of the Judgment\" Heuristic (New Heuristic):** When the Court appoints an amicus to defend a ground the respondent has abandoned, it strongly signals the Court's skepticism of that ground and makes a reversal on that specific point highly probable.\n\n6.  **The \"Conditional Cert Grant\" Heuristic (New Heuristic):** A respondent who successfully convinces the Court to add a \"threshold\" question is signaling that the lower court reached the right result for the wrong reason. The Court's acceptance of this invitation provides a clear roadmap to the case's central legal battle.\n\n7.  **The Research Cycle is Paramount (Confirmed & Refined):** The cycle of **Plan -> Locate -> Retrieve & Verify -> Synthesize -> Check -> Refine Plan** is the fundamental engine of belief updating. My plan to research the circuit split on the FTCA exceptions has now been refined: **Use the parties' briefs as curated research guides. After analyzing the petitioner's brief, the next action should be to retrieve and analyze the respondent's brief to map the counterarguments and competing authorities directly.** This is far more efficient than an unguided search.\n\n8.  **Argument Structure as a Signal (New Heuristic):** The structure of a merits brief is a strong indicator of a party's strategic thinking. The order of arguments and the page count allocated to each reveals what the party considers to be the dispositive issue and their primary path to victory.\n\n9.  **Rhetorical Framing Matters (New Heuristic):** Recognizing a party's rhetorical frame\u2014here, the petitioners' \"legislative prerogative vs. judicial overreach\" frame\u2014is key to predicting how arguments will resonate with different judicial philosophies. This separation-of-powers framing is a potent strategy before the current Supreme Court.\n\n10. **Clash of Canons (New Heuristic):** Statutory interpretation cases are often a battle over which interpretive canon applies. Identifying the canons deployed by each side (e.g., \"specific governs the general\") is essential for analyzing the legal merits and predicting the outcome. The next step is to anticipate the counter-canons the government will use."

          "task_beliefs": "My understanding of this case's legal landscape has been significantly enhanced by analyzing the government's cert-stage Brief in Opposition (BIO). While this document precedes the petitioner's merits brief in the litigation timeline, its analysis provides crucial insight into the government's strategic thinking from the outset and confirms the central points of contention for the merits stage.\n\n1.  **Case Status (Confirmed):** The BIO is a cert-stage document, confirming the procedural history I previously reconstructed. It solidifies my understanding of the case's progression from the lower courts to the Supreme Court.\n\n2.  **Legal Questions & Argumentative Priority (Sharpened & Confirmed):** The BIO confirms that the two key issues are the Supremacy Clause and the interplay between the FTCA's discretionary function exception (\u00a7 2680(a)) and the law enforcement proviso (\u00a7 2680(h)).\n    *   **Supremacy Clause Argument (Confirmed as Abandoned):** The BIO provides definitive early evidence that the government viewed the Eleventh Circuit's Supremacy Clause holding as indefensible. Their strategy was not to defend the reasoning but to argue the case was a poor vehicle for review because the petitioners would lose anyway on other grounds. This elevates my confidence in a reversal on this question from \"extremely high\" to **near-certainty**. The government's decision to argue \"right result, wrong reason\" at the cert stage is a clear admission that the reasoning itself is weak.\n    *   **Primary Battleground (Confirmed & Clarified):** The BIO reveals the government's counter-argument to the petitioners' statutory claim. The government's position is that the discretionary function exception (\u00a7 2680(a)) acts as an absolute bar that is analyzed *before* and independently of the law enforcement proviso (\u00a7 2680(h)). They argue that since Agent Guerra's actions in planning the raid were discretionary and susceptible to policy analysis under the `Gaubert` test, any claims arising from those actions are barred, regardless of whether they are intentional torts listed in the proviso. This sets the stage for the central clash:\n        *   **Petitioners' View:** The proviso (\u00a7 2680(h)) is a specific carve-out that trumps the general discretionary function exception (\u00a7 2680(a)).\n        *   **Government's View:** The discretionary function exception (\u00a7 2680(a)) is a threshold jurisdictional bar that prevents courts from even considering claims based on discretionary acts, rendering the proviso irrelevant in such cases.\n\n3.  **Substantive Arguments (Detailed View of Government's Position):**\n    *   **On the Statutory Question:** The government's BIO argument relies heavily on the Eleventh Circuit's own precedent in `Mesa v. United States` to argue that planning and executing a warrant are classic discretionary functions. They assert that this view is not in conflict with other circuits on a practical, outcome-determinative level. They frame the petitioners' claims as an attempt to use tort law for \"judicial 'second-guessing'\" of executive branch policy decisions, which the exception was designed to prevent.\n    *   **On the Supremacy Clause Question:** The government's argument is notable for its absence. They summarize the lower court's holding but pivot immediately to argue that the Court need not address it.\n\n4.  **Predictive Model (Updated & Refined):**\n    *   **On the Supremacy Clause Question:** Prediction of **reversal** is solidified. The BIO confirms this is not a contested point on the merits.\n    *   **On the Statutory Interpretation Question:** My prediction is now more nuanced. While I was \"cautiously optimistic\" for a petitioner victory, seeing the government's framing of the issue highlights the strength of their counter-argument. This is a classic statutory puzzle. The outcome will likely depend on which interpretive canon the Court prioritizes: the petitioners' \"specific governs the general\" canon, or the government's \"jurisdictional bar must be cleared first\" structural argument. My prediction shifts from cautiously optimistic to **highly uncertain, with a slight edge to the petitioners**. The petitioners' argument that the government's reading would render the law enforcement proviso meaningless in many \"no-knock\" raid cases remains powerful, as courts generally avoid interpretations that make statutory language superfluous. The government's forthcoming merits brief is now the most critical piece of evidence needed to resolve this uncertainty.",
          "design_beliefs": "This observation has been exceptionally valuable, not for providing new facts, but for revealing the strategic evolution of legal arguments across different procedural stages. This has refined several existing heuristics and generated new, more sophisticated ones.\n\n1.  **Internal Consistency Checking (Validated & Refined):** Remains a core principle. The BIO's contents are fully consistent with my deduction that the government abandoned the Supremacy Clause argument, validating the entire reasoning chain.\n\n2.  **Metadata is Evidentiary (Reinforced):** The document's title, \"BRIEF FOR THE RESPONDENTS IN OPPOSITION,\" was the most critical piece of information. It immediately framed the document's strategic purpose (to prevent a cert grant) and prevented me from misinterpreting its arguments as the government's final merits position.\n\n3.  **Map Arguments to Procedural Stage (Refined into a New Heuristic):** My prior heuristic was too general. It is now refined into a more specific principle.\n    *   **Heuristic: The Brief in Opposition (BIO) as a Strategic Bellwether (New):** A respondent's BIO is a unique document type whose primary goal is to persuade the Court *not* to hear a case. Analyzing a BIO reveals key strategic choices. Common tactics observed here include: (1) reframing the petitioner's sharp legal question into a broad, fact-bound one; (2) arguing \"right for the wrong reason\" to concede a lower court error while claiming the ultimate outcome was correct; and (3) minimizing a circuit split by framing it as a difference in reasoning, not outcome. A BIO provides a powerful preview of the respondent's core theory of the case.\n\n4.  **Prioritize Primary Sources (Reinforced):** Confirmed.\n\n5.  **The \"Amicus in Support of the Judgment\" Heuristic (Stable):** Remains a valid heuristic, though not triggered by this observation.\n\n6.  **The \"Conditional Cert Grant\" Heuristic (Stable):** Remains a valid heuristic, though not triggered by this observation.\n\n7.  **The Research Cycle is Paramount (Refined):** My plan was to get the respondent's *merits* brief, but I retrieved the BIO instead. This proved highly informative. The principle is refined: **The research cycle should be flexible and non-linear. Analyzing chronologically earlier documents (like a BIO) after later ones (like a petitioner's merits brief) is not a step backward; it provides crucial context on the strategic evolution of arguments and strengthens the predictive model.**\n\n8.  **Argument Structure as a Signal (Reinforced):** The BIO's structure, which front-loads the discretionary function argument and effectively ignores the Supremacy Clause, confirmed the government's strategic priorities at the cert stage.\n\n9.  **Rhetorical Framing Matters (Reinforced):** The government's framing of this issue as \"judicial second-guessing\" of executive functions is a clear appeal to separation-of-powers principles, mirroring the petitioners' own framing but from the opposite perspective.\n\n10. **Clash of Canons (Reinforced):** This observation confirms the case will turn on a clash of interpretive canons. I have now seen both sides' opening moves: petitioners will argue \"the specific (\u00a7 2680(h)) governs the general (\u00a7 2680(a))\" and that statutes should not be read to be superfluous; the government will argue that \u00a7 2680(a) is a threshold jurisdictional requirement that must be satisfied before any other provision is even considered. My next step is to see how these arguments are developed in the government's full merits brief."

App. 2a-19a) \nis available at 2024 WL 1716235.  The order of the dis-\ntrict court (Pet. App. 21a-32a) is available at 2022 WL \n18263039.  A prior order of the district court (Pet. App. \n34a-68a) is reported at 631 F. Supp. 3d. 1281.  \nJURISDICTION \nThe judgment of the court of appeals was entered on \nApril 22, 2024.  A petition for rehearing was denied on \nMay 30, 2024. (Pet. App. 70a-71a).  On July 22, 2024, \nJustice Thomas extended the time within which to file a \npetition for a writ of certiorari to and including Septem-\nber 27, 2024, and the petition was filed on that day.  The \njurisdiction of this Court is invoked under 28 U.S.C. \n1254(1). \n\n2 \n \nSTATEMENT \n1. The Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA), 28 U.S.C. \n1346(b), 2671 et seq., enacted in 1946, generally waives \nthe sovereign immunity of the United States and cre-\nates a cause of action for damages against the United \nStates with respect to certain torts of federal employ-\nees, acting within the scope of their employment, under \ncircumstances in which a private individual would be li-\nable under state law.  See 28 U.S.C. 1346(b)(1).  The \nFTCA contains various exceptions that limit the waiver \nof sovereign immunity and the substantive scope of the \nUnited States\u2019 liability, including an exception for any \nclaim \u201cbased upon the exercise or performance or the \nfailure to exercise or perform a discretionary function \nor duty on the part of a federal agency or an employee \nof the Government, whether or not the discretion in-\nvolved be abused.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 2680(a).   \nThe FTCA also excludes from its waiver of sovereign \nimmunity most intentional torts:  \u201c[a]ny claim arising \nout of assault, battery, false imprisonment, false arrest, \nmalicious prosecution, abuse of process, libel, slander, \nmisrepresentation, deceit, or interference with contract \nrights.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 2680(h).  In 1974, Congress added a \nproviso to the intentional tort exception, known as the \nlaw enforcement proviso.  See Act of Mar. 16, 1974, Pub. \nL. No. 93-253, \u00a7 2, 88 Stat. 50.  The law enforcement \nproviso states that \u201cthe provisions of this chapter and \nsection 1346(b) of this title shall apply to any claim aris-\ning  * * *  out of assault, battery, false imprisonment, \nfalse arrest, abuse of process, or malicious prosecution\u201d \nthat is based on \u201cacts or omissions of investigative or \nlaw enforcement officers of the United States Govern-\nment.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 2680(h). \n\n3 \n \n2. In 2015, the Federal Bureau of Investigation \n(FBI) initiated an operation concerning violent gang ac-\ntivity in Georgia.  Pet. App. 4a.  The operation ultimately \nresulted in the criminal indictment of several individu-\nals, including Joseph Riley.  Id. at 3a-4a.  Officers ob-\ntained warrants for Riley\u2019s arrest and for the search of \nhis home at 3741 Landau Lane SW, Atlanta, Georgia \n30331.  Id. at 4a.     \nThe FBI assigned Special Agent Lawrence Guerra \nto lead a Special Weapons and Tactics (SWAT) team in \nthe execution of the search warrant.  Pet. App. 4a-5a.  \nThe FBI has a standard operating procedure that re-\nquires its agents to conduct a site survey or a drive-by \nbefore executing a high-risk warrant, such as the one \nfor Riley\u2019s arrest.  Id. at 5a.  The FBI, however, does \nnot have any policies that govern how to locate or navi-\ngate to a target address.  Ibid.   \nGuerra took several steps in preparation to execute \nthe warrant.  He reviewed information that other FBI \nagents had obtained through surveillance of Riley and \n3741 Landau Lane.  Pet. App. 4a-6a.  He conducted a \nsite survey of 3741 Landau Lane, during which he took \nphotographs and identified specific features of the home \nso that he could locate the property when executing the \nwarrant in the early morning.  Id. at 5a.  Guerra noted \nthat the house was beige and split-level, located on a \ncorner lot, had a driveway and garage facing a separate \nstreet that ran perpendicular to the front door, and had \na large tree in the front corner of the property.  Ibid.  \nGuerra also wrote tactical notes outlining how his team \nwould execute the warrant, and he attended an opera-\ntional briefing, which included presentations on and \nphotographs of Riley and 3741 Landau Lane.  Id. at 6a.  \n\n4 \n \nIn the pre-dawn hours of October 18, 2017, Guerra \nconducted a further drive-by with FBI Special Agent \nMichael Lemoine.  Pet. App. 4a, 6a.  Navigating in com-\nplete darkness, Guerra used his personal GPS device to \nlocate 3741 Landau Lane.  Ibid.  When the GPS unit \nalerted that they had arrived at 3741 Landau Lane, \nGuerra observed what he believed to be the same house \nhe had seen during his previous site survey: the home \nwas beige and split-level, located on a corner lot, had a \ntight stairway and stoop leading to the front door with \nwindows on either side, had a driveway and garage fac-\ning a separate street that ran perpendicular to the front \ndoor, and had a large tree in the front corner of the \nproperty.  Id. at 6a-7a.  Guerra also observed a black \nCamaro in the driveway, which he would later use as a \nreference point to locate 3741 Landau Lane.  Id. at 7a.   \nUnbeknownst to Guerra and Lemoine, however, the \nGPS had directed them to a different home\u20143756 Den-\nville Trace, petitioners\u2019 residence.  Pet. App. 6a-7a.  Pe-\ntitioners\u2019 home at 3756 Denville Trace faces Landau \nLane and is a few houses (approximately 436 feet) from \n3741 Landau Lane.  Ibid.  The house number does not \nappear on the house itself; instead, it appears on the \nmailbox and is not visible from the street.  Id. at 7a.   \nThe same day\u2014and while it was still dark out\u2014\nGuerra, Lemoine, and other agents left for 3741 Landau \nLane in a caravan of vehicles.  Pet. App. 7a.  Guerra \nidentified what he believed to be 3741 Landau Lane \nbased on the black Camaro, his prior preparation, and \nthe morning drive-by.  Ibid.  He directed that his vehicle \nstop in front of the house, and the other vehicles fol-\nlowed suit.  Ibid.  The members of the SWAT team then \nassembled in their positions, and after Guerra knocked \n\n5 \n \nand announced the presence of law enforcement, agents \nentered the home.  Id. at 7a-8a.  \nThe agents were in the home for approximately five \nminutes before realizing their mistake.  Pet. App. 39a.  \nDuring that time, the SWAT team members found peti-\ntioners Hilliard Toi Cliatt and Curtrina Martin in a \ncloset, where Cliatt kept a shotgun for protection.  Id. \nat 3a, 8a.  With their guns pointed, agents pulled Cliatt \nout of the closet and placed him in handcuffs.  Id. at 8a.   \nA SWAT team member also pointed a gun at Martin \nwhile instructing her to keep her hands up.  Ibid.  Shortly \nafter detaining Cliatt, however, the officers realized \nthat they had entered the wrong house.  Ibid.  An agent \nimmediately lifted Cliatt from the ground and uncuffed \nhim.  Ibid.  Guerra advised petitioners that he would re-\nturn to explain what had happened.  Id. at 8a-9a.   \nThe agents promptly executed the search warrant at \n3741 Landau Lane, making an arrest of Riley as he at-\ntempted to flee.  Pet. App. 9a.  Once Riley and 3741 Lan-\ndau Lane were secured, Guerra returned to petitioners\u2019 \nhome, where he apologized, provided his business card \nand the name of his supervisor, documented the damage \nto the home, and advised petitioners that the FBI would \nhandle the damages repairs.  Ibid.  \n3. In September 2019, petitioners brought suit \nagainst the United States under the FTCA.  Pet. App. \n9a.  Petitioners raised several claims based on state tort \nlaw, including, as relevant here, negligence, negli-\ngent/intentional infliction of emotional distress, tres-\npass and interference with private property, false im-\nprisonment, and assault and battery.  Ibid.1  \n \n1  Petitioners also brought a claim against Guerra under Bivens v. \nSix Unknown Named Agents of Federal Bureau of Narcotics, 403 \n \n\n6 \n \nThe district court granted in part the government\u2019s \nmotion for summary judgment.  Pet. App. 34a-68a.  The \ncourt held that the discretionary function exception in \nthe FTCA barred petitioners\u2019 claims for negligence, \nnegligent/intentional infliction of emotional distress, \ntrespass and interference with private property.  Id. at \n58a.  The court denied summary judgment, however, \nwith respect to two claims\u2014for false imprisonment and \nfor assault and battery\u2014that involved torts listed in the \nlaw enforcement proviso.  Id. at 59a-60a.  The court ex-\nplained that under Eleventh Circuit precedent, claims \nthat implicate the law enforcement proviso may proceed \neven if the acts giving rise to the claim involve a discre-\ntionary function.  Ibid.; see Nguyen v. United States, \n556 F.3d 1244, 1256 (11th Cir. 2009).   \nUpon a motion for reconsideration, the district court \ngranted the government\u2019s motion for summary judg-\nment in full and dismissed the complaint.  Pet. App. 21a-\n32a.  In its reconsideration order, the court, applying \nrecent Eleventh Circuit precedent, held that the Su-\npremacy Clause of the Constitution precluded petition-\ners from bringing their false imprisonment and assault \nand battery claims against the United States.  Id. at \n26a-27a (citing Kordash v. United States, 51 F.4th 1289 \n(11th Cir. 2022)).   \n4. The court of appeals affirmed in an unpublished, \nper curiam decision.  See Pet. App. 2a-19a.   \nThe court of appeals first held that the discretionary \nfunction exception barred petitioners\u2019 claims for torts \n \nU.S. 388 (1971), alleging that Guerra\u2019s mistaken execution of the \nwarrant at their house had violated their Fourth Amendment rights.  \nPet. App. 9a.  The court of appeals affirmed the dismissal of that \nclaim on qualified immunity grounds.  Id. at 13a-15a.  Petitioners do \nnot seek review of that holding.  See Pet. 10 n.1.     \n\n7 \n \nthat were not listed in the law enforcement proviso, i.e., \n\u201ctrespass and interference with private property,     \nnegligent/intentional infliction of emotional distress, \nand negligence.\u201d  Pet. App. 17a.  The court explained \nthat the discretionary function exception to the FTCA \n\u201cexempts from liability state-tort claims arising from a \ngovernment official\u2019s performance of a duty or function \nthat involves discretion.\u201d  Id. at 16a.  And here, the court \nobserved, Guerra \u201cenjoyed discretion\u201d under FBI poli-\ncies as to how to prepare for the execution of the war-\nrant, and his decision was \u201c\u200a\u2018susceptible to policy analy-\nsis,\u2019\u200a\u201d id. at 17a-18a (quoting Mesa v. United States, 123 \nF.3d 1435, 1438 (11th Cir. 1997)).   \nThe court of appeals also affirmed the dismissal of \npetitioners\u2019 false imprisonment and assault and battery \nclaims.  The court held that the Supremacy Clause, \n\u201c[s]imilar to the discretionary function exception,\u201d \u201cen-\nsures that states do not impede or burden the execution \nof federal law.\u201d  Pet. App. 16a.  Under circuit precedent, \n\u201c[t]he government may invoke the Supremacy Clause \nagainst state-tort liability\u201d if it demonstrates that the \nofficial\u2019s acts (i) \u201c\u200a\u2018have some nexus with furthering fed-\neral policy\u2019\u200a\u201d and (ii) \u201c\u200a\u2018can reasonably be characterized \nas complying with the full range of federal law.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Id. at \n17a (quoting Kordash, 51 F.4th at 1293).  The court held \nthat Guerra\u2019s acts had a \u201c\u200a\u2018nexus with furthering federal \npolicy\u2019\u200a\u201d because there was \u201cno doubt that Guerra acted \nwithin the scope of his discretionary authority when he \nprepared for and executed the search warrant.\u201d  Id. at \n19a (citation omitted).  And the court concluded that \nGuerra\u2019s actions complied with the \u201cfull range\u201d of fed-\neral law because he did not \u201cviolate[] the Fourth Amend-\nment.\u201d  Ibid.  The court explained that \u201can officer who \nmakes \u2018reasonable effort[s] to ascertain and identify \n\n8 \n \nthe\u2019 target address of a valid search warrant complies \nwith the Fourth Amendment,\u201d and \u201cthe decisions that \nGuerra made,\u201d while mistaken, were the \u201ckind of rea-\nsonable mistakes that the Fourth Amendment contem-\nplates,\u201d as they involved the execution of \u201ca high-risk \nwarrant\u201d in a \u201crapidly-changing and dangerous situa-\ntion.\u201d  Id. at 13a-14a (citation omitted; brackets in orig-\ninal).   \nARGUMENT \nPetitioners contend (Pet. 23-34) that the court of ap-\npeals misapplied the discretionary function exception in \nSection 2680(a) to dismiss their claims for trespass, in-\nterference with private property, negligent/intentional \ninfliction of emotional distress, and negligence.  That \ncontention lacks merit.  The court of appeals correctly \nheld (Pet. App. 15a-18a) that the discretionary function \nexception barred those claims, and its factbound and \nnonprecedential decision is consistent with decisions of \nthis Court and other courts of appeals.   \nPetitioners further contend (Pet. 16-23) that the \ncourt of appeals erred in affirming the dismissal of their \nclaims for false imprisonment and assault and battery.  \nPetitioners correctly observe that the court\u2019s reasoning \nfor rejecting those claims differs from the approach of \nother circuits, but that disagreement did not affect the \nproper disposition of the case.  The court correctly held \nthat petitioners\u2019 claims are barred, and no court of ap-\npeals to have addressed the issue would have reached a \ndifferent result.  Accordingly, this Court\u2019s review is not \nwarranted.     \n1. The court of appeals correctly held that the dis-\ncretionary function exception to the FTCA bars peti-\ntioners\u2019 claims for trespass and interference with pri-\n\n9 \n \nvate property, negligent/intentional infliction of emo-\ntional distress, and negligence.  Insofar as petitioners \nchallenge that holding, they do so on fact-specific \ngrounds, and their effort to identify relevant disagree-\nments among the courts of appeals is without merit.      \n \na. The FTCA\u2019s discretionary function exception pro-\nvides that the United States\u2019 waiver of sovereign im-\nmunity does not apply to claims based on an employee\u2019s \n\u201cexercise or performance or the failure to exercise or \nperform a discretionary function or duty  * * *, whether \nor not the discretion involved be abused.\u201d  28 U.S.C. \n2680(a).  The exception serves to \u201cprevent judicial \u2018sec-\nond-guessing\u200a\u2019 of legislative and administrative deci-\nsions  * * *  through the medium of an action in tort.\u201d  \nUnited States v. Gaubert, 499 U.S. 315, 323 (1991) (cita-\ntion omitted).   \nThis Court has established a two-part inquiry to \nguide application of the discretionary function excep-\ntion.  Gaubert, 499 U.S. at 322-323.  First, a court must \ndetermine whether the conduct challenged by the plain-\ntiff was \u201cdiscretionary in nature\u201d\u2014that is, whether it \ninvolved \u201c\u200a\u2018an element of judgment or choice.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Id. at \n322 (citation omitted).  \u201cThe requirement of judgment \nor choice is not satisfied if a \u2018federal statute, regulation, \nor policy specifically prescribes a course of action for an \nemployee to follow,\u2019 because \u2018the employee has no right-\nful option but to adhere to the directive.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Ibid. (quot-\ning Berkovitz v. United States, 486 U.S. 531, 536 (1988)).  \nSecond, a court must evaluate \u201cwhether that judgment \nis of the kind that the discretionary function exception \nwas designed to shield,\u201d id. at 322-323 (quoting Berkovitz, \n486 U.S. at 536), meaning it is \u201csusceptible to policy \nanalysis,\u201d id. at 325. \n\n10 \n \nGuerra\u2019s conduct in executing the search warrant \nsatisfied the Gaubert standard.  As the court of appeals \nobserved, the FBI did not have policies that \u201cdictate[d] \nhow agents are to prepare for warrant executions,\u201d and \nGuerra instead exercised discretion as to how to inves-\ntigate the location.  Pet. App. 18a (emphasis omitted).  \nThat decision required judgment:  an agent must weigh, \namong other things, \u201cthe urgency of apprehending the \nsubject,\u201d the need to \u201ckeep the investigation secret,\u201d \nand \u201cavailable resources\u201d in allocating agents across \n\u201cthe many investigations for which they are responsi-\nble.\u201d  Mesa v. United States, 123 F.3d 1435, 1438 (11th \nCir. 1997).  Here, Guerra faced a \u201crapidly-changing and \ndangerous situation,\u201d Pet. App. 14a, and he exercised \ndiscretion to conduct his drive-by in the dark, with the \nheadlights dimmed, to \u201cavoid detection\u201d before execut-\ning a high-risk warrant, id. at 37a.  While Guerra did \nnot have discretion to intentionally \u201craid the wrong \nhouse,\u201d Pet. 31, he did have discretion in determining \nthe preparatory steps necessary to \u201clocate and identify\u201d \nthe target address,\u201d Pet. App. 18a.    \nGuerra\u2019s conduct likewise satisfied the second com-\nponent of Gaubert\u2019s two-part inquiry because his \u201cdeci-\nsion as to how to locate and identify the subject of an \narrest warrant  * * *  is susceptible to policy analysis.\u201d  \nPet. App. 18a (quoting Mesa, 123 F.3d at 1438).  The \nfactors described above\u2014which include competing con-\nsiderations like officer and public safety, resource con-\nstraints, tactical considerations, and accuracy\u2014are all \n\u201cfundamentally rooted in policy considerations,\u201d for which \n\u201cjudicial second-guessing\u201d is not appropriate.  Mesa, 123 \nF.3d at 1438.  The court of appeals therefore correctly \nheld that Guerra\u2019s preparatory efforts here \u201cf\u200a[e]ll \n\n11 \n \nsquarely within the discretionary function exception.\u201d  \nPet. App. 18a (citation omitted).  \nb. Petitioners briefly contend (Pet. 28-30) that the \ncourt of appeals erred in holding that Guerra\u2019s execu-\ntion of the warrant was \u201csusceptible to policy analysis\u201d \nand thus \u201c\u200a\u2018of the kind that the discretionary function \nexception was designed to shield.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Gaubert, 499 U.S. \nat 322-323, 325 (citation omitted).  In petitioners\u2019 view \n(Pet. 30), the proper inquiry asks whether a federal em-\nployee\u2019s acts \u201cactually\u201d\u2014\u201cnot just hypothetically\u201d\u2014\nwere grounded in policy analysis.   \nThis Court has long since rejected the subjective \nstandard that petitioners advocate.  In Gaubert, this \nCourt explained that the \u201cfocus of the inquiry is not on \nthe agent\u2019s subjective intent in exercising the discretion \nconferred by statute or regulation, but on the nature of \nthe actions taken.\u201d  499 U.S. at 325.  Thus, the relevant \nquestion is not how an officer thinks about his or her \nconduct; the question is whether the conduct is of the \n\u201ckind\u201d that, by its nature, can be \u201cgrounded in the pol-\nicy of the regulatory regime.\u201d  Ibid. (emphasis added).  \nConsistent with that approach, the Eleventh Circuit fo-\ncused on the nature of Guerra\u2019s conduct, explaining that \n\u201ca federal officer\u2019s \u2018decision as to how to locate and iden-\ntify the subject of an arrest warrant\u2019\u200a\u201d is the kind of act \nthat requires discretion.  Pet. App. 18a (quoting Mesa, \n123 F.3d at 1438).   \nContrary to petitioners\u2019 assertion (Pet. 28-30), the \ncourts of appeals are unanimous, not divided, in follow-\ning this Court\u2019s guidance.  Petitioners recognize that \nnine circuits have held that an official\u2019s act need \u201cnot be \nactually grounded in policy considerations,\u201d so long as it \nis, \u201cby its nature, susceptible to a policy analysis.\u201d  Pet. \n28 (quoting Miller v. United States, 163 F.3d 591, 593 \n\n12 \n \n(9th Cir. 1998)).  And contrary to petitioners\u2019 contention \n(Pet. 28-30), the Third Circuit likewise examines the \n\u201cnature of the actions taken,\u201d not the \u201csubjective in-\ntent\u201d of the agent.  Baer v. United States, 722 F.3d 168, \n175 (2013) (quoting Gaubert, 499 U.S. at 325) (emphasis \nomitted); see Middleton v. United States Fed. Bureau \nof Prisons, 658 Fed. Appx. 167, 169-170 (3d Cir. 2016) \n(per curiam) (concluding that task was susceptible to \npolicy analysis without considering whether officials ac-\ntually engaged in such analysis).  \nc. Petitioners also maintain that review is warranted \nto resolve two disagreements among the courts of ap-\npeal as to how the discretionary function exception ap-\nplies.  That contention is meritless.  To the extent any \ndisagreements exists among the courts of appeals, this \ncase does not implicate them.   \ni. Petitioners contend (Pet. 31-33) that the courts of \nappeals disagree on whether the discretionary function \nexception is applicable where a federal employee\u2019s con-\nduct runs afoul of the Constitution.  That question played \nno role in the court of appeals\u2019 decision.  The court held \nthat \u201cGuerra\u2019s actions did not violate the Fourth Amend-\nment.\u201d  Pet. App. 19a.  In particular, the Court concluded \nthat that Guerra\u2019s actions \u201cconstitute[d] the kind of rea-\nsonable mistakes that the Fourth Amendment contem-\nplates.\u201d  Id. at 14a.  Petitioners do not challenge that fact-\nbound determination, see Pet. i, and this case therefore \npresents no opportunity to resolve any differences \namong the courts of appeals as to the application of the \ndiscretionary function exception to unconstitutional \nconduct.2 \n \n2 Petitioners argue that the court of appeals spoke \u201cimprecise[ly]\u201d \nwhen it stated that \u201c\u200a\u2018Guerra\u2019s \n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

App. 2a-19a) \nis available at 2024 WL 1716235.  The order of the dis-\ntrict court (Pet. App. 21a-32a) is available at 2022 WL \n18263039.  A prior order of the district court (Pet. App. \n34a-68a) is reported at 631 F. Supp. 3d. 1281.  \nJURISDICTION \nThe judgment of the court of appeals was entered on \nApril 22, 2024.  A petition for rehearing was denied on \nMay 30, 2024. (Pet. App. 70a-71a).  On July 22, 2024, \nJustice Thomas extended the time within which to file a \npetition for a writ of certiorari to and including Septem-\nber 27, 2024, and the petition was filed on that day.  The \njurisdiction of this Court is invoked under 28 U.S.C. \n1254(1). \n\n2 \n \nSTATEMENT \n1. The Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA), 28 U.S.C. \n1346(b), 2671 et seq., enacted in 1946, generally waives \nthe sovereign immunity of the United States and cre-\nates a cause of action for damages against the United \nStates with respect to certain torts of federal employ-\nees, acting within the scope of their employment, under \ncircumstances in which a private individual would be li-\nable under state law.  See 28 U.S.C. 1346(b)(1).  The \nFTCA contains various exceptions that limit the waiver \nof sovereign immunity and the substantive scope of the \nUnited States\u2019 liability, including an exception for any \nclaim \u201cbased upon the exercise or performance or the \nfailure to exercise or perform a discretionary function \nor duty on the part of a federal agency or an employee \nof the Government, whether or not the discretion in-\nvolved be abused.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 2680(a).   \nThe FTCA also excludes from its waiver of sovereign \nimmunity most intentional torts:  \u201c[a]ny claim arising \nout of assault, battery, false imprisonment, false arrest, \nmalicious prosecution, abuse of process, libel, slander, \nmisrepresentation, deceit, or interference with contract \nrights.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 2680(h).  In 1974, Congress added a \nproviso to the intentional tort exception, known as the \nlaw enforcement proviso.  See Act of Mar. 16, 1974, Pub. \nL. No. 93-253, \u00a7 2, 88 Stat. 50.  The law enforcement \nproviso states that \u201cthe provisions of this chapter and \nsection 1346(b) of this title shall apply to any claim aris-\ning  * * *  out of assault, battery, false imprisonment, \nfalse arrest, abuse of process, or malicious prosecution\u201d \nthat is based on \u201cacts or omissions of investigative or \nlaw enforcement officers of the United States Govern-\nment.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 2680(h). \n\n3 \n \n2. In 2015, the Federal Bureau of Investigation \n(FBI) initiated an operation concerning violent gang ac-\ntivity in Georgia.  Pet. App. 4a.  The operation ultimately \nresulted in the criminal indictment of several individu-\nals, including Joseph Riley.  Id. at 3a-4a.  Officers ob-\ntained warrants for Riley\u2019s arrest and for the search of \nhis home at 3741 Landau Lane SW, Atlanta, Georgia \n30331.  Id. at 4a.     \nThe FBI assigned Special Agent Lawrence Guerra \nto lead a Special Weapons and Tactics (SWAT) team in \nthe execution of the search warrant.  Pet. App. 4a-5a.  \nThe FBI has a standard operating procedure that re-\nquires its agents to conduct a site survey or a drive-by \nbefore executing a high-risk warrant, such as the one \nfor Riley\u2019s arrest.  Id. at 5a.  The FBI, however, does \nnot have any policies that govern how to locate or navi-\ngate to a target address.  Ibid.   \nGuerra took several steps in preparation to execute \nthe warrant.  He reviewed information that other FBI \nagents had obtained through surveillance of Riley and \n3741 Landau Lane.  Pet. App. 4a-6a.  He conducted a \nsite survey of 3741 Landau Lane, during which he took \nphotographs and identified specific features of the home \nso that he could locate the property when executing the \nwarrant in the early morning.  Id. at 5a.  Guerra noted \nthat the house was beige and split-level, located on a \ncorner lot, had a driveway and garage facing a separate \nstreet that ran perpendicular to the front door, and had \na large tree in the front corner of the property.  Ibid.  \nGuerra also wrote tactical notes outlining how his team \nwould execute the warrant, and he attended an opera-\ntional briefing, which included presentations on and \nphotographs of Riley and 3741 Landau Lane.  Id. at 6a.  \n\n4 \n \nIn the pre-dawn hours of October 18, 2017, Guerra \nconducted a further drive-by with FBI Special Agent \nMichael Lemoine.  Pet. App. 4a, 6a.  Navigating in com-\nplete darkness, Guerra used his personal GPS device to \nlocate 3741 Landau Lane.  Ibid.  When the GPS unit \nalerted that they had arrived at 3741 Landau Lane, \nGuerra observed what he believed to be the same house \nhe had seen during his previous site survey: the home \nwas beige and split-level, located on a corner lot, had a \ntight stairway and stoop leading to the front door with \nwindows on either side, had a driveway and garage fac-\ning a separate street that ran perpendicular to the front \ndoor, and had a large tree in the front corner of the \nproperty.  Id. at 6a-7a.  Guerra also observed a black \nCamaro in the driveway, which he would later use as a \nreference point to locate 3741 Landau Lane.  Id. at 7a.   \nUnbeknownst to Guerra and Lemoine, however, the \nGPS had directed them to a different home\u20143756 Den-\nville Trace, petitioners\u2019 residence.  Pet. App. 6a-7a.  Pe-\ntitioners\u2019 home at 3756 Denville Trace faces Landau \nLane and is a few houses (approximately 436 feet) from \n3741 Landau Lane.  Ibid.  The house number does not \nappear on the house itself; instead, it appears on the \nmailbox and is not visible from the street.  Id. at 7a.   \nThe same day\u2014and while it was still dark out\u2014\nGuerra, Lemoine, and other agents left for 3741 Landau \nLane in a caravan of vehicles.  Pet. App. 7a.  Guerra \nidentified what he believed to be 3741 Landau Lane \nbased on the black Camaro, his prior preparation, and \nthe morning drive-by.  Ibid.  He directed that his vehicle \nstop in front of the house, and the other vehicles fol-\nlowed suit.  Ibid.  The members of the SWAT team then \nassembled in their positions, and after Guerra knocked \n\n5 \n \nand announced the presence of law enforcement, agents \nentered the home.  Id. at 7a-8a.  \nThe agents were in the home for approximately five \nminutes before realizing their mistake.  Pet. App. 39a.  \nDuring that time, the SWAT team members found peti-\ntioners Hilliard Toi Cliatt and Curtrina Martin in a \ncloset, where Cliatt kept a shotgun for protection.  Id. \nat 3a, 8a.  With their guns pointed, agents pulled Cliatt \nout of the closet and placed him in handcuffs.  Id. at 8a.   \nA SWAT team member also pointed a gun at Martin \nwhile instructing her to keep her hands up.  Ibid.  Shortly \nafter detaining Cliatt, however, the officers realized \nthat they had entered the wrong house.  Ibid.  An agent \nimmediately lifted Cliatt from the ground and uncuffed \nhim.  Ibid.  Guerra advised petitioners that he would re-\nturn to explain what had happened.  Id. at 8a-9a.   \nThe agents promptly executed the search warrant at \n3741 Landau Lane, making an arrest of Riley as he at-\ntempted to flee.  Pet. App. 9a.  Once Riley and 3741 Lan-\ndau Lane were secured, Guerra returned to petitioners\u2019 \nhome, where he apologized, provided his business card \nand the name of his supervisor, documented the damage \nto the home, and advised petitioners that the FBI would \nhandle the damages repairs.  Ibid.  \n3. In September 2019, petitioners brought suit \nagainst the United States under the FTCA.  Pet. App. \n9a.  Petitioners raised several claims based on state tort \nlaw, including, as relevant here, negligence, negli-\ngent/intentional infliction of emotional distress, tres-\npass and interference with private property, false im-\nprisonment, and assault and battery.  Ibid.1  \n \n1  Petitioners also brought a claim against Guerra under Bivens v. \nSix Unknown Named Agents of Federal Bureau of Narcotics, 403 \n \n\n6 \n \nThe district court granted in part the government\u2019s \nmotion for summary judgment.  Pet. App. 34a-68a.  The \ncourt held that the discretionary function exception in \nthe FTCA barred petitioners\u2019 claims for negligence, \nnegligent/intentional infliction of emotional distress, \ntrespass and interference with private property.  Id. at \n58a.  The court denied summary judgment, however, \nwith respect to two claims\u2014for false imprisonment and \nfor assault and battery\u2014that involved torts listed in the \nlaw enforcement proviso.  Id. at 59a-60a.  The court ex-\nplained that under Eleventh Circuit precedent, claims \nthat implicate the law enforcement proviso may proceed \neven if the acts giving rise to the claim involve a discre-\ntionary function.  Ibid.; see Nguyen v. United States, \n556 F.3d 1244, 1256 (11th Cir. 2009).   \nUpon a motion for reconsideration, the district court \ngranted the government\u2019s motion for summary judg-\nment in full and dismissed the complaint.  Pet. App. 21a-\n32a.  In its reconsideration order, the court, applying \nrecent Eleventh Circuit precedent, held that the Su-\npremacy Clause of the Constitution precluded petition-\ners from bringing their false imprisonment and assault \nand battery claims against the United States.  Id. at \n26a-27a (citing Kordash v. United States, 51 F.4th 1289 \n(11th Cir. 2022)).   \n4. The court of appeals affirmed in an unpublished, \nper curiam decision.  See Pet. App. 2a-19a.   \nThe court of appeals first held that the discretionary \nfunction exception barred petitioners\u2019 claims for torts \n \nU.S. 388 (1971), alleging that Guerra\u2019s mistaken execution of the \nwarrant at their house had violated their Fourth Amendment rights.  \nPet. App. 9a.  The court of appeals affirmed the dismissal of that \nclaim on qualified immunity grounds.  Id. at 13a-15a.  Petitioners do \nnot seek review of that holding.  See Pet. 10 n.1.     \n\n7 \n \nthat were not listed in the law enforcement proviso, i.e., \n\u201ctrespass and interference with private property,     \nnegligent/intentional infliction of emotional distress, \nand negligence.\u201d  Pet. App. 17a.  The court explained \nthat the discretionary function exception to the FTCA \n\u201cexempts from liability state-tort claims arising from a \ngovernment official\u2019s performance of a duty or function \nthat involves discretion.\u201d  Id. at 16a.  And here, the court \nobserved, Guerra \u201cenjoyed discretion\u201d under FBI poli-\ncies as to how to prepare for the execution of the war-\nrant, and his decision was \u201c\u200a\u2018susceptible to policy analy-\nsis,\u2019\u200a\u201d id. at 17a-18a (quoting Mesa v. United States, 123 \nF.3d 1435, 1438 (11th Cir. 1997)).   \nThe court of appeals also affirmed the dismissal of \npetitioners\u2019 false imprisonment and assault and battery \nclaims.  The court held that the Supremacy Clause, \n\u201c[s]imilar to the discretionary function exception,\u201d \u201cen-\nsures that states do not impede or burden the execution \nof federal law.\u201d  Pet. App. 16a.  Under circuit precedent, \n\u201c[t]he government may invoke the Supremacy Clause \nagainst state-tort liability\u201d if it demonstrates that the \nofficial\u2019s acts (i) \u201c\u200a\u2018have some nexus with furthering fed-\neral policy\u2019\u200a\u201d and (ii) \u201c\u200a\u2018can reasonably be characterized \nas complying with the full range of federal law.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Id. at \n17a (quoting Kordash, 51 F.4th at 1293).  The court held \nthat Guerra\u2019s acts had a \u201c\u200a\u2018nexus with furthering federal \npolicy\u2019\u200a\u201d because there was \u201cno doubt that Guerra acted \nwithin the scope of his discretionary authority when he \nprepared for and executed the search warrant.\u201d  Id. at \n19a (citation omitted).  And the court concluded that \nGuerra\u2019s actions complied with the \u201cfull range\u201d of fed-\neral law because he did not \u201cviolate[] the Fourth Amend-\nment.\u201d  Ibid.  The court explained that \u201can officer who \nmakes \u2018reasonable effort[s] to ascertain and identify \n\n8 \n \nthe\u2019 target address of a valid search warrant complies \nwith the Fourth Amendment,\u201d and \u201cthe decisions that \nGuerra made,\u201d while mistaken, were the \u201ckind of rea-\nsonable mistakes that the Fourth Amendment contem-\nplates,\u201d as they involved the execution of \u201ca high-risk \nwarrant\u201d in a \u201crapidly-changing and dangerous situa-\ntion.\u201d  Id. at 13a-14a (citation omitted; brackets in orig-\ninal).   \nARGUMENT \nPetitioners contend (Pet. 23-34) that the court of ap-\npeals misapplied the discretionary function exception in \nSection 2680(a) to dismiss their claims for trespass, in-\nterference with private property, negligent/intentional \ninfliction of emotional distress, and negligence.  That \ncontention lacks merit.  The court of appeals correctly \nheld (Pet. App. 15a-18a) that the discretionary function \nexception barred those claims, and its factbound and \nnonprecedential decision is consistent with decisions of \nthis Court and other courts of appeals.   \nPetitioners further contend (Pet. 16-23) that the \ncourt of appeals erred in affirming the dismissal of their \nclaims for false imprisonment and assault and battery.  \nPetitioners correctly observe that the court\u2019s reasoning \nfor rejecting those claims differs from the approach of \nother circuits, but that disagreement did not affect the \nproper disposition of the case.  The court correctly held \nthat petitioners\u2019 claims are barred, and no court of ap-\npeals to have addressed the issue would have reached a \ndifferent result.  Accordingly, this Court\u2019s review is not \nwarranted.     \n1. The court of appeals correctly held that the dis-\ncretionary function exception to the FTCA bars peti-\ntioners\u2019 claims for trespass and interference with pri-\n\n9 \n \nvate property, negligent/intentional infliction of emo-\ntional distress, and negligence.  Insofar as petitioners \nchallenge that holding, they do so on fact-specific \ngrounds, and their effort to identify relevant disagree-\nments among the courts of appeals is without merit.      \n \na. The FTCA\u2019s discretionary function exception pro-\nvides that the United States\u2019 waiver of sovereign im-\nmunity does not apply to claims based on an employee\u2019s \n\u201cexercise or performance or the failure to exercise or \nperform a discretionary function or duty  * * *, whether \nor not the discretion involved be abused.\u201d  28 U.S.C. \n2680(a).  The exception serves to \u201cprevent judicial \u2018sec-\nond-guessing\u200a\u2019 of legislative and administrative deci-\nsions  * * *  through the medium of an action in tort.\u201d  \nUnited States v. Gaubert, 499 U.S. 315, 323 (1991) (cita-\ntion omitted).   \nThis Court has established a two-part inquiry to \nguide application of the discretionary function excep-\ntion.  Gaubert, 499 U.S. at 322-323.  First, a court must \ndetermine whether the conduct challenged by the plain-\ntiff was \u201cdiscretionary in nature\u201d\u2014that is, whether it \ninvolved \u201c\u200a\u2018an element of judgment or choice.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Id. at \n322 (citation omitted).  \u201cThe requirement of judgment \nor choice is not satisfied if a \u2018federal statute, regulation, \nor policy specifically prescribes a course of action for an \nemployee to follow,\u2019 because \u2018the employee has no right-\nful option but to adhere to the directive.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Ibid. (quot-\ning Berkovitz v. United States, 486 U.S. 531, 536 (1988)).  \nSecond, a court must evaluate \u201cwhether that judgment \nis of the kind that the discretionary function exception \nwas designed to shield,\u201d id. at 322-323 (quoting Berkovitz, \n486 U.S. at 536), meaning it is \u201csusceptible to policy \nanalysis,\u201d id. at 325. \n\n10 \n \nGuerra\u2019s conduct in executing the search warrant \nsatisfied the Gaubert standard.  As the court of appeals \nobserved, the FBI did not have policies that \u201cdictate[d] \nhow agents are to prepare for warrant executions,\u201d and \nGuerra instead exercised discretion as to how to inves-\ntigate the location.  Pet. App. 18a (emphasis omitted).  \nThat decision required judgment:  an agent must weigh, \namong other things, \u201cthe urgency of apprehending the \nsubject,\u201d the need to \u201ckeep the investigation secret,\u201d \nand \u201cavailable resources\u201d in allocating agents across \n\u201cthe many investigations for which they are responsi-\nble.\u201d  Mesa v. United States, 123 F.3d 1435, 1438 (11th \nCir. 1997).  Here, Guerra faced a \u201crapidly-changing and \ndangerous situation,\u201d Pet. App. 14a, and he exercised \ndiscretion to conduct his drive-by in the dark, with the \nheadlights dimmed, to \u201cavoid detection\u201d before execut-\ning a high-risk warrant, id. at 37a.  While Guerra did \nnot have discretion to intentionally \u201craid the wrong \nhouse,\u201d Pet. 31, he did have discretion in determining \nthe preparatory steps necessary to \u201clocate and identify\u201d \nthe target address,\u201d Pet. App. 18a.    \nGuerra\u2019s conduct likewise satisfied the second com-\nponent of Gaubert\u2019s two-part inquiry because his \u201cdeci-\nsion as to how to locate and identify the subject of an \narrest warrant  * * *  is susceptible to policy analysis.\u201d  \nPet. App. 18a (quoting Mesa, 123 F.3d at 1438).  The \nfactors described above\u2014which include competing con-\nsiderations like officer and public safety, resource con-\nstraints, tactical considerations, and accuracy\u2014are all \n\u201cfundamentally rooted in policy considerations,\u201d for which \n\u201cjudicial second-guessing\u201d is not appropriate.  Mesa, 123 \nF.3d at 1438.  The court of appeals therefore correctly \nheld that Guerra\u2019s preparatory efforts here \u201cf\u200a[e]ll \n\n11 \n \nsquarely within the discretionary function exception.\u201d  \nPet. App. 18a (citation omitted).  \nb. Petitioners briefly contend (Pet. 28-30) that the \ncourt of appeals erred in holding that Guerra\u2019s execu-\ntion of the warrant was \u201csusceptible to policy analysis\u201d \nand thus \u201c\u200a\u2018of the kind that the discretionary function \nexception was designed to shield.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Gaubert, 499 U.S. \nat 322-323, 325 (citation omitted).  In petitioners\u2019 view \n(Pet. 30), the proper inquiry asks whether a federal em-\nployee\u2019s acts \u201cactually\u201d\u2014\u201cnot just hypothetically\u201d\u2014\nwere grounded in policy analysis.   \nThis Court has long since rejected the subjective \nstandard that petitioners advocate.  In Gaubert, this \nCourt explained that the \u201cfocus of the inquiry is not on \nthe agent\u2019s subjective intent in exercising the discretion \nconferred by statute or regulation, but on the nature of \nthe actions taken.\u201d  499 U.S. at 325.  Thus, the relevant \nquestion is not how an officer thinks about his or her \nconduct; the question is whether the conduct is of the \n\u201ckind\u201d that, by its nature, can be \u201cgrounded in the pol-\nicy of the regulatory regime.\u201d  Ibid. (emphasis added).  \nConsistent with that approach, the Eleventh Circuit fo-\ncused on the nature of Guerra\u2019s conduct, explaining that \n\u201ca federal officer\u2019s \u2018decision as to how to locate and iden-\ntify the subject of an arrest warrant\u2019\u200a\u201d is the kind of act \nthat requires discretion.  Pet. App. 18a (quoting Mesa, \n123 F.3d at 1438).   \nContrary to petitioners\u2019 assertion (Pet. 28-30), the \ncourts of appeals are unanimous, not divided, in follow-\ning this Court\u2019s guidance.  Petitioners recognize that \nnine circuits have held that an official\u2019s act need \u201cnot be \nactually grounded in policy considerations,\u201d so long as it \nis, \u201cby its nature, susceptible to a policy analysis.\u201d  Pet. \n28 (quoting Miller v. United States, 163 F.3d 591, 593 \n\n12 \n \n(9th Cir. 1998)).  And contrary to petitioners\u2019 contention \n(Pet. 28-30), the Third Circuit likewise examines the \n\u201cnature of the actions taken,\u201d not the \u201csubjective in-\ntent\u201d of the agent.  Baer v. United States, 722 F.3d 168, \n175 (2013) (quoting Gaubert, 499 U.S. at 325) (emphasis \nomitted); see Middleton v. United States Fed. Bureau \nof Prisons, 658 Fed. Appx. 167, 169-170 (3d Cir. 2016) \n(per curiam) (concluding that task was susceptible to \npolicy analysis without considering whether officials ac-\ntually engaged in such analysis).  \nc. Petitioners also maintain that review is warranted \nto resolve two disagreements among the courts of ap-\npeal as to how the discretionary function exception ap-\nplies.  That contention is meritless.  To the extent any \ndisagreements exists among the courts of appeals, this \ncase does not implicate them.   \ni. Petitioners contend (Pet. 31-33) that the courts of \nappeals disagree on whether the discretionary function \nexception is applicable where a federal employee\u2019s con-\nduct runs afoul of the Constitution.  That question played \nno role in the court of appeals\u2019 decision.  The court held \nthat \u201cGuerra\u2019s actions did not violate the Fourth Amend-\nment.\u201d  Pet. App. 19a.  In particular, the Court concluded \nthat that Guerra\u2019s actions \u201cconstitute[d] the kind of rea-\nsonable mistakes that the Fourth Amendment contem-\nplates.\u201d  Id. at 14a.  Petitioners do not challenge that fact-\nbound determination, see Pet. i, and this case therefore \npresents no opportunity to resolve any differences \namong the courts of appeals as to the application of the \ndiscretionary function exception to unconstitutional \nconduct.2 \n \n2 Petitioners argue that the court of appeals spoke \u201cimprecise[ly]\u201d \nwhen it stated that \u201c\u200a\u2018Guerra\u2019s actions did not violate the Fourth \n \n\n13 \n \nPetitioners also overstate the extent of disagree-\nment on that question.  The government agrees that a \nconstitutional mandate, no less than a federal statu-\ntory or regulatory one, can eliminate a government of-\nficial\u2019s discretion when it is sufficiently specific or when \nan authoritative construction and application with suffi-\ncient specificity was clearly established before the of-\nficer acted.  Many of the cases that petitioners cite are \nconsistent with that position, as the government ex-\nplained in its brief in opposition (at 8-11) in Shivers v. \nUnited States, 142 S. Ct. 1361 (2022) (No. 21-682).3  And this \nCourt has repeatedly denied petitions for writs of certiorari \nraising similar issues.  See ibid.; Linder v. United States, \n141 S. Ct. 159 (2020) (No. 19-1082); Chaidez Campos v. \nUnited States, 139 S. Ct. 1317 (2019) (No. 18-234); Cas-\ntro v. United States, 562 U.S. 1168 (2011) (No. 10-309); \nWelch v. United States, 546 U.S. 1214 (2006) (No. 05-\n529).   \n \nAmendment,\u2019\u200a\u201d and instead held only that Guerra\u2019s actions did not \nviolate \u201c\u200a\u2018clearly established law,\u2019\u200a\u201d without reaching the question of \nwhether there was a violation of substantive Fourth Amendment \nlaw.  Pet. 13 n.4 (citations omitted); see Pet. 32-33.  That is incorrect.  \nIn addition to \u201cdetermin[ing] whether [Guerra\u2019s] actions violated \nthe Fourth Amendment\u201d in its qualified immunity analysis, the \ncourt also considered as part of its Supremacy Clause analysis \nwhether Guerra \u201ccomplied with the full range of the Fourth Amend-\nment.\u201d  Pet. App. 19a; see id. at 17a (describing inquiry \u201c[w]hen \nfaced with the determination whether the actions a law enforcement \nofficer took comply with the Fourth Amendment\u201d).  It concluded \nthat Guerra\u2019s actions did so.  Id. at 19a.   \n3  After the government\u2019s filing in Shivers, the First Circuit held \nthat constitutional violations may preclude application of the discre-\ntionary function exception even if the violation in question was not \nclearly established.  See Torres-Estrada v. Cases, 88 F.4th 14, 20-23 \n(2023).    \n\n14 \n \nii. This case also does not implicate any conflict \namong the courts of appeals as to whether \u201ccareless acts\u201d \nfall outside the discretionary function exception.  See Pet. \n34.  As petitioners acknowledge (ibid.), the Eleventh Cir-\ncuit has not addressed that question, and it had no oc-\ncasion to do so in this case.  Petitioners did not argue in \nthe court of appeals that Guerra had acted carelessly.  \nSee Pet. C.A. Br. 34-53.  And the court did not treat his \nacts as careless; on the contrary, it recognized that \nGuerra took \u201creasonable\u201d steps to correctly identify the \ntarget of the search warrant and simply made a mistake \nin the \u201crapidly-changing and dangerous situation of exe-\ncuting a high-risk warrant at night.\u201d  Pet. App. 14a.  \nThis case therefore would come out no differently re-\ngardless of whether careless acts fall outside the discre-\ntionary function exception.    \n2. The court of appeals also correctly affirmed the \ndistrict court\u2019s dismissal of petitioners\u2019 claims for false \nimprisonment and assault and battery.  Those claims \nare barred by the discretionary function exception, the \nsame as petitioners\u2019 other state-law tort claims.  Every \nother court of appeals to consider the issue would have \nresolved this case in the United States\u2019 favor on that ba-\nsis.  While the Eleventh Circuit used a different ra-\ntionale to reach the same result, that methodological \ndisagreement makes no practical difference and does \nnot warrant this Court\u2019s review.   \na. For the same reason that petitioners\u2019 other tort \nclaims cannot proceed, see pp. 8-12, supra, the discre-\ntionary function exception precludes petitioners\u2019 claims \nfor false imprisonment and assault and battery.  In ar-\nguing otherwise, petitioners suggest (Pet. 26-27) that \nthe exception is categorically inapplicable to torts listed \n\n15 \n \nin the law enforcement proviso of Section 2680(h).  That \nis wrong.  \ni. \u201c[A] waiver of the Government\u2019s sovereign im-\nmunity will be strictly construed, in terms of its scope, \nin favor of the sovereign.\u201d  Lane v. Pena, 518 U.S. 187, \n192 (1996).  When Congress enacted the law enforce-\nment proviso in 1974, it placed the proviso within the \nintentional tort exception, Section 2680(h), and thereby \nmodified that particular exception to the FTCA.  Al-\nthough provisos sometimes have a broader import, it is \ncustomary to use a proviso to refer only to things cov-\nered by the preceding clause.  See United States v. Mor-\nrow, 266 U.S. 531, 535 (1925) (\u201c[T]he presumption is \nthat, in accordance with its primary purpose, [a proviso] \nrefers only to the provision to which it is attached.\u201d); \nAntonin Scalia & Bryan A. Garner, Reading Law:  In-\nterpretation of Legal Texts 154 (2012) (\u201cA proviso con-\nditions the principal matter that it qualifies\u2014almost al-\nways the matter immediately preceding.\u201d).  Here, the \ntext, structure, and history of Section 2680 all strongly \nreinforce the conclusion that the law enforcement pro-\nviso has the customary scope of modifying only the pre-\nceding clause. \nSignificantly, Congress did not make the law en-\nforcement proviso an amendment to any of the other ex-\nceptions in Section 2680, such as the discretionary func-\ntion exception, which it could have done if it had in-\ntended to modify those preexisting exceptions as well.  \nAnd the conclusion that the proviso relates only to the \npreceding clause of subsection (h) is reinforced by the \nproviso\u2019s reference specifically to some (but not all) of \nthe intentional torts excepted in that prior clause.  See \n28 U.S.C. 2680(h) (\u201cProvided, That, with regard to acts \n\n16 \n \nor omissions of investigative or law enforcement offic-\ners of the United States,\u201d the FTCA \u201cshall apply\u201d to \nclaims alleging one of the select named intentional \ntorts.).  Moreover, the final sentence of Section 2680(h) \nfurnishes, \u201c[f]or the purpose of this subsection,\u201d a defi-\nnition of the term \u201c\u200a\u2018investigative or law enforcement of-\nficer.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Ibid. (emphasis added).  Because that term ap-\npears only in the law enforcement proviso, the final sen-\ntence in subsection (h) thereby links the proviso exclu-\nsively to the intentional tort exception in \u201cthis subsec-\ntion\u201d in that additional way as well.  Ibid. \nFurther still, the law enforcement proviso expressly \nstates that \u201cthe provisions of [Chapter 171  * * *  shall \napply\u201d to claims described within the proviso, 28 U.S.C. \n2680(h) (emphasis added), and the discretionary func-\ntion exception in 28 U.S.C. 2680(a) is one of the provi-\nsions of Chapter 171.  See Simmons v. Himmelreich, \n578 U.S. 621, 627 (2016) (interpreting the FTCA and \nholding that, \u201c[a]bsent persuasive indications to the \ncontrary,\u201d the Court will \u201cpresume Congress says what \nit means and means what it says\u201d).  Given the text and \nplacement of the law enforcement proviso in the statute, \nthe proviso is properly read as a modification only of the \nfirst clause of Section 2680(h)\u2014the clause excepting al-\ntogether certain intentional torts from the FTCA. \nA broader reading of the law enforcement proviso\u2014\nas a limitation not only upon the intentional tort excep-\ntion but also upon the other exceptions in Section \n2680\u2014would allow tort suits against the United States \nthat Congress plainly intended to bar.  Under petition-\ners\u2019 interpretation, a plaintiff alleging an intentional \ntort with respect to acts or omissions of law enforce-\nment officers could bring an FTCA claim arising in a \nforeign country notwithstanding 28 U.S.C. 2680(k), \n\n17 \n \nwhich prohibits all tort claims \u201carising in a foreign coun-\ntry.\u201d  See Sosa v. Alvarez-Machain, 542 U.S. 692, 699-712 \n(2004) (holding that foreign country exception barred \nFTCA claim for false arrest).  The language and struc-\nture of Section 2680 as a whole therefore do not support \nthe counterintuitive suggestion that Congress intended \nto override foundational compromises in the FTCA and \npermit suits arising abroad, or from discretionary func-\ntions, simply because the plaintiff\u2019s claim involves an al-\nleged tort by a law enforcement officer.  \nii. Notwithstanding the plain text of the statute, pe-\ntitioners (Pet. 26-27) and their amici (Members of Con-\ngress Amici Br. 4-13) contend that the government\u2019s po-\nsition conflicts with Congress\u2019s purpose in enacting the \nlaw enforcement proviso.  As this Court has recognized, \nit must \u201cfollow the text even if doing so will supposedly \nundercut a basic objective of the statute.\u201d  Baker Botts \nL.L.P. v. ASARCO LLC, 576 U.S. 121, 135 (2015) (cita-\ntion and internal quotation marks omitted).  But here, \nthe history and context of the law enforcement proviso \nreinforce that it was not intended to negate the discre-\ntionary function exception.  \nCongress adopted the proviso \u201cas a counterpart to \nthe Bivens case and its progen[y], in that it waives the \ndefense of sovereign immunity so as to make the Gov-\nernment independently liable in damages for the same \ntype of conduct that is alleged to have occurred in \nBivens.\u201d  Carlson v. Green, 446 U.S. 14, 20 (1980) (quot-\ning S. Rep. No. 588, 93d Cong., 1st Sess. 3 (1973) (Sen-\nate Report)).  Defendants in Bivens actions are entitled \nto immunity when their actions do not violate clearly es-\ntablished constitutional proscriptions, Harlow v. Fitz-\ngerald, 457 U.S. 800, 813-819 (1982), and as noted above, \n\n18 \n \nthat same kind of immunity is incorporated into the dis-\ncretionary function exception, see p. 13, supra.  The ap-\nplication of the discretionary function exception to con-\nduct covered by the law enforcement proviso thus is \nconsistent with the FTCA serving as a counterpart to \nBivens.  See Carlson, 446 U.S. at 19-20 (\u201c[T]he congres-\nsional comments accompanying [the law enforcement \nproviso in Section 2680(h)] made it crystal clear that \nCongress views FTCA and Bivens as parallel, comple-\nmentary causes of action.\u201d). \nThe construction of the law enforcement proviso and \ndiscretionary function exception advanced by the gov-\nernment therefore best gives effect to every provision \nof the statute and does not leave the law enforcement \nproviso without effect.  To start, many claims arising \nfrom the intentional torts of law enforcement officers do \nnot implicate discretionary functions at all.  See, e.g., \nLinder v. United States, 937 F.3d 1087, 1091 (7th Cir. \n2019), cert. denied, 141 S. Ct. 159 (2020) (explaining that \nit is clearly established that law enforcement officers do \nnot have discretion to commit perjury).  Likewise, the \nUnited States will not be shielded by the discretionary \nfunction exception under the FTCA for the conduct of \nfederal law enforcement officers if they act in violation \nof a clearly established constitutional, statutory, or reg-\nulatory directive, just as individual officers are not en-\ntitled to qualified immunity under Bivens when they vi-\nolate clearly established law.   \nThe law enforcement proviso accordingly retains full \nforce when law enforcement officers \u201cact in bad faith or \nwithout legal justification,\u201d including when they con-\nduct the type of \u201craids\u201d that Congress intended the law \nenforcement proviso to deter.  Senate Report 3.  Congress \nadded the proviso to create a cause of action for \u201cthe \n\n19 \n \nsame type of conduct that [wa]s alleged to have oc-\ncurred in Bivens,\u201d Carlson, 446 U.S. at 20 (quoting Sen-\nate Report 3)\u2014i.e., the raid of a home \u201cwithout cause, \nconsent or warrant,\u201d Bivens v. Six Unknown Named \nAgents of Fed. Bureau of Narcotics, 403 U.S. 388, 390 \nn.1 (1971) (citation omitted).  That also was true of the \nCollinsville raids that petitioners cite (Pet. 26) as the \nbasis for the law enforcement proviso.  Those \u201c\u200a\u2018no-knock\u2019 \nraids  * * *  into two different homes,\u201d involving the \n\u201csame Justice Department agents,\u201d were conducted \n\u201cwithout warrants\u201d and in an \u201cabusive\u201d fashion.  Senate \nReport 2-3 (emphasis added).  This case\u2014involving an \nofficer\u2019s \u201creasonable mistakes\u201d when \u201cexecuting a high-\nrisk warrant\u201d in a \u201crapidly-changing and dangerous sit-\nuation\u201d\u2014bears no resemblance to those warrantless \nraids.  Pet. App. 14a.   \nb. As petitioners acknowledge (Pet. 25), every court \nof appeals\u2014except the Eleventh Circuit\u2014to consider \nthe issue has held that the discretionary function excep-\ntion applies to the tort claims listed in the law enforce-\nment proviso in Section 2680(h).  See Linder, 937 F.3d \nat 1088-1089 (rejecting argument that the law enforce-\nment \u201cproviso overrides the rest of [Section] 2680\u201d); \nJoiner v. United States, 955 F.3d 399, 406 (5th Cir. \n2020) (\u201c[T]he law enforcement proviso does not negate \nthe discretionary function exception.\u201d); Medina v. \nUnited States, 259 F.3d 220, 228-229 (4th Cir. 2001) \n(where the discretionary function exception applies, it \ncontrols, even if the plaintiff alleges intentional torts \nwithin the law enforcement proviso); Gray v. Bell, 712 \nF.2d 490, 507-508 (D.C. Cir. 1983) (same), cert. denied, \n465 U.S. 1100 (1984); Caban v. United States, 671 F.2d \n1230, 1234 (2d Cir. 1982) (law enforcement proviso must \n\n20 \n \nbe read in conjunction with discretionary function ex-\nception); see also Gasho v. United States, 39 F.3d 1420, \n1433-1434 (9th Cir. 1994) (where the FTCA exception in \n28 U.S.C. 2680(c) applies, that exception controls not-\nwithstanding the law enforcement proviso), cert. de-\nnied, 515 U.S. 1144 (1995).  Because Guerra\u2019s conduct \nfalls within the discretionary function exception, see pp. \n8-12, supra, every other court of appeals would have up-\nheld the district court\u2019s judgment on that basis.    \nc. The court of appeals affirmed the district court\u2019s \njudgment on a different rationale.  The court of appeals \nstated that there was \u201cno doubt that Guerra acted \nwithin the scope of his discretionary authority when he \nprepared for and executed the search warrant.\u201d  Pet. \nApp. at 19a.  The court was bound, however, by circuit \nprecedent holding that torts listed in the law enforce-\nment proviso fall outside the scope of the discretionary \nfunction exception.  See Nguyen v. United States, 556 \nF.3d 1244, 1256 (11th Cir. 2009).  The court therefore \naffirmed dismissal of petitioners\u2019 false imprisonment \nand assault and battery claims on different grounds:  It \napplied other circuit precedent holding that, \u201c[s]imilar \nto the discretionary function exception, the Supremacy \nClause ensures that states do not impede or burden the \nexecution of federal law.\u201d  Pet. App. 16a (citing Denson \nv. United States, 574 F.3d 1318, 1336-1337 (11th Cir. \n2009), cert. denied, 560 U.S. 952 (2010)).  \nThe court of appeals\u2019 premise is sound.  Congress could \nnot have intended that the United States would be held \nliable for the actions of its law enforcement officers that \nare discretionary and within the scope of their official \nduties, because such conduct would ordinarily be privi-\nleged.  For the reasons explained above, however, that \nprotection for the actions of law enforcement officers is \n\n21 \n \nlocated in the FTCA itself, with no need to consider the \nSupremacy Clause.  See pp. 14-19, supra.  Although the \ncourt did not analyze the issue in that way, any error is \nirrelevant to the proper disposition of this case.  As ex-\nplained above, petitioners\u2019 claims must fail because they \narise out of Guerra\u2019s exercise of a discretionary func-\ntion.  See pp. 8-12, supra.   \nNor does the disagreement between the Eleventh \nCircuit and the other courts of appeals regarding the \ninterplay of the discretionary function exception and \nthe law enforcement proviso warrant this Court\u2019s re-\nview.  The Eleventh Circuit \u201cstands alone\u201d in holding \nthat the discretionary function exception is inapplicable \nto the torts listed in the law enforcement proviso.  \nLinder, 937 F.3d at 1089.  But the decision below rests \non the same fundamental insight as the other courts of \nappeals:  The United States cannot face liability for the \nacts of a law enforcement officer who \u201cacted within the \nscope of his discretionary authority.\u201d  Pet. App. 17a.  \nThus, the disagreement as to methodology has little \npractical significance, and the Court has previously de-\nnied petitions implicating the disagreement.  See \nLinder, 141 S. Ct. at 159; Denson v. United States, 560 \nU.S. 952, 952 (2010).  The same result is warranted here. \nd. If the Court were to grant a writ of certiorari to \nreview the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s application of the Su-\npremacy Clause to bar certain FTCA claims, it should \nalso direct the parties to address an additional question:  \nWhether the discretionary function exception is cate-\ngorically inapplicable to claims arising under the law \nenforcement proviso to the intentional torts exception.  \nAs petitioners acknowledge (Pet. 25), the court of ap-\npeals reached the constitutional question only because \nit could not address the statutory question under circuit \n\n22 \n \nlaw.  Resolving that threshold question is therefore nec-\nessary to a proper construction of the FTCA.  And, as \nthe other courts of appeals to address the question have \nrecognized, there is no sound basis for holding that a \nclaim falls outside the scope of the discretionary func-\ntion exception just because it is not separately barred \nby the enumerated torts exception.  For the reasons \ngiven above, however, the Court should deny the peti-\ntion for a writ of certiorari.   \nCONCLUSION \nThe petition for a writ of certiorari should be denied.  \nRespectfully submitted. \n \n \nELIZABETH B.

          "task_beliefs": "This observation was a meta-cognitive reflection on my research process and did not introduce new substantive facts or arguments about the case. Therefore, my core understanding of the legal landscape and my predictions remain stable, but my assessment of the remaining uncertainty has been sharpened and focused.\n\n1.  **Case Status (Stable):** The procedural history from the district court through the cert grant is well-established.\n\n2.  **Legal Questions & Argumentative Priority (Stable & Focused):** My understanding of the two central questions remains unchanged.\n    *   **Supremacy Clause Argument (Stable):** My prediction of a **near-certain reversal** on this question is unchanged. The government's decision to argue \"right for the wrong reason\" in its Brief in Opposition (BIO) remains the strongest evidence that they will not defend the Eleventh Circuit's reasoning on the merits.\n    *   **Primary Battleground (Stable & Prioritized):** The clash over the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA) remains the core of the case. This observation solidifies my belief that the single most important, and currently missing, piece of evidence is the **Respondent's (United States) Merits Brief**. My entire predictive model for this question hinges on seeing how the government develops the arguments it previewed in the BIO. The central conflict is stable:\n        *   **Petitioners' View:** The law enforcement proviso (\u00a7 2680(h)) is a specific exception to sovereign immunity that must be given effect, superseding the general discretionary function exception (\u00a7 2680(a)) in cases involving intentional torts by law enforcement.\n        *   **Government's (Anticipated) View:** The discretionary function exception (\u00a7 2680(a)) is a threshold jurisdictional bar. If an action is discretionary, the courts have no jurisdiction to hear a claim arising from it, making the proviso (\u00a7 2680(h)) irrelevant.\n\n3.  **Predictive Model (Stable with Sharpened Uncertainty):**\n    *   **On the Supremacy Clause Question:** Prediction of **reversal** remains firm.\n    *   **On the Statutory Interpretation Question:** My prediction remains **highly uncertain, with a slight edge to the petitioners**. This observation, however, clarifies that this uncertainty is not general but is specifically tied to the absence of the government's full merits argument. I have analyzed the petitioners' opening salvo and the government's cert-stage parry; I now require the government's full counter-attack to proceed. My model is currently at an impasse pending the acquisition of this specific document.",
          "design_beliefs": "This observation, while containing no new case information, was exceptionally valuable at the design level. It provided a direct lesson in the mechanics of effective information retrieval and the importance of adapting a research strategy in response to failure.\n\n1.  **Internal Consistency Checking (Stable):** Remains a core principle.\n\n2.  **Metadata is Evidentiary (Reinforced):** The failure to distinguish between the BIO and the merits brief underscores the importance of not just reading metadata, but using it actively in the search and retrieval process.\n\n3.  **Map Arguments to Procedural Stage (Reinforced):** This experience is a practical demonstration of this heuristic's importance. Failing to differentiate documents by procedural stage led to a failed action, reinforcing the need to be precise about what stage a document belongs to.\n\n4.  **The BIO as a Strategic Bellwether (Stable):** This heuristic, derived from the previous observation, remains a key part of my model for understanding argument evolution.\n\n5.  **Prioritize Primary Sources (Reinforced):** This principle is stable.\n\n6.  **The Research Cycle is Paramount (Reinforced & Refined):** My previous refinement noted the value of a non-linear research path. This observation adds a corollary: the cycle must also include **error-correction and adaptation**. When a step in the cycle fails (e.g., a search returns the wrong document), the next step must be to diagnose the failure and execute a more precise, corrective action. The cycle is not just flexible, but self-correcting.\n\n7.  **Argument Structure as a Signal (Stable):** Remains a valid heuristic for interpreting legal documents.\n\n8.  **Rhetorical Framing Matters (Stable):** Remains a key interpretive tool.\n\n9.  **Clash of Canons (Stable):** My understanding of the central interpretive clash is unchanged and awaits further evidence.\n\n10. **Employ Precise Search Queries to Disambiguate Procedural Stages (New):** This is a new, highly practical heuristic born from the failure observed. When searching for legal briefs in a case's lifecycle, generic queries (e.g., \"respondent's brief\") are prone to error because they can match documents from different procedural stages (certiorari vs. merits). To ensure the retrieval of the correct document and avoid wasted actions, the search strategy must employ specific filters. Using field-specific queries (e.g., filtering by `proceeding_title` to distinguish a \"Brief for Respondents\" from a \"Brief for Respondents in Opposition\") is a necessary tactic for efficient and accurate information gathering."

The petitioners have filed their merits brief, but the United States (respondent) has not yet filed its brief on the merits. The document I have been seeking does not yet exist in the available data. This confirms the case is in the merits briefing stage, but not as far along as I had previously hypothesized.\n\n2.  **Legal Questions & Argumentative Priority (Stable & Reaffirmed):** My understanding of the core legal issues is unchanged, but my assessment of the available evidence is now firm.\n    *   **Supremacy Clause Argument (Stable):** Prediction of a **near-certain reversal** remains unchanged. The government's arguments in the Brief in Opposition (BIO) remain the latest official statement of their position, and they did not defend the Eleventh Circuit's Supremacy Clause reasoning there.\n    *   **Primary Battleground - FTCA Interpretation (Stable & Confirmed Impasse):** The clash between the discretionary function exception (\u00a7 2680(a)) and the law enforcement proviso (\u00a7 2680(h)) is definitively the central issue. This observation confirms that the single most important piece of evidence\u2014the government's full merits argument developing its position from the BIO\u2014is currently unavailable. My analysis is stalled pending its release. The core conflict remains:\n        *   **Petitioners' View:** The proviso (\u00a7 2680(h)) carves out specific intentional torts by law enforcement from the government's sovereign immunity, and this specific statute overrides the general discretionary function exception (\u00a7 2680(a)).\n        *   **Government's (Anticipated) View:** The discretionary function exception (\u00a7 2680(a)) is a threshold jurisdictional question. If an act is discretionary, the court lacks jurisdiction entirely, rendering the law enforcement proviso (\u00a7 2680(h)) inapplicable.\n\n3.  **Predictive Model (Stable with Confirmed Uncertainty):**\n    *   **On the Supremacy Clause Question:** Prediction of **reversal** remains firm.\n    *   **On the Statutory Interpretation Question:** My prediction remains **highly uncertain, with a slight edge to the petitioners**. This observation solidifies that this uncertainty is not a modeling failure but a direct result of a known, critical data gap. I have now confirmed the absence of the government's merits brief, and my model cannot be meaningfully updated on this question until that brief is filed and analyzed.",
          "design_beliefs": "This failed search action was extremely informative at the design level. It stress-tested a new heuristic and provided powerful lessons about the nature of information gathering and the value of negative results.\n\n1.  **Internal Consistency Checking (Stable):** Remains a core principle.\n\n2.  **Metadata is Evidentiary (Reinforced):** This principle remains crucial. The explicit title \"BRIEF FOR THE RESPONDENTS IN OPPOSITION\" on the returned document was the definitive signal that my search had failed to find the target document, overriding any ambiguity in the search query itself.\n\n3.  **Map Arguments to Procedural Stage (Reinforced):** This heuristic remains essential. The failure to find the merits brief and the re-surfacing of the BIO reinforces the need to keep a clear mental map of which documents and arguments belong to which stage of litigation.\n\n4.  **The BIO as a Strategic Bellwether (Stable):** This heuristic is unaffected. The BIO remains my best, albeit incomplete, guide to the government's likely strategy.\n\n5.  **Prioritize Primary Sources (Reinforced):** The entire exercise is a testament to this principle. The high value I've placed on the (missing) merits brief is a direct application of this rule.\n\n6.  **The Research Cycle is Paramount (Reinforced & Refined):** This observation adds a critical refinement: a \"failed\" search that confirms the *non-existence* of a piece of information is a successful and productive step in the cycle. The cycle is not just about finding information, but also about mapping the boundaries of what is currently knowable. My cycle was: Hypothesize -> Search -> Observe Failure -> Diagnose -> Adapt. This is a successful execution of a self-correcting research process.\n\n7.  **Argument Structure as a Signal (Stable):** Remains a valid heuristic for when I do acquire new documents.\n\n8.  **Rhetorical Framing Matters (Stable):** Remains a key interpretive tool.\n\n9.  **Clash of Canons (Stable):** My model of the interpretive clash is stable and awaits the government's merits brief.\n\n10. **Employ Precise Search Queries to Disambiguate Procedural Stages (Validated):** This new heuristic from the previous step has been tested and validated, albeit in a counterintuitive way. The precise query and field filters *worked perfectly*. They prevented the system from returning a slew of irrelevant documents and correctly identified that the only document matching the general terms was the BIO from the cert stage. The failure was not in the search strategy, but in the target document's availability. This confirms the heuristic is essential for avoiding false positives and for efficiently confirming the absence of information.\n\n11. **Negative Search Results Are Strong Evidence (New):** A search that returns no results (or returns known, incorrect results) for a specific, primary-source document is not a neutral outcome. It is strong evidence that the document is not currently available in the database. This \"negative information\" is highly valuable, as it prevents wasted actions, updates the model of the case's procedural status, and defines the current frontier of uncertainty.\n\n12. **Model the Procedural Timeline (New):** This experience reveals a gap in my strategy. It's not enough to know the *sequence* of documents (Petition, BIO, Reply, Merits Briefs, etc.). To form accurate expectations about information availability, I must also have a general model of the *timing* and deadlines involved in Supreme Court litigation. Knowing that a respondent's merits brief is typically due 30-35 days after the petitioner's would have allowed me to predict that my search might be premature, thus managing my own expectations and action planning more effectively."

Us ually, th ese claims sound  in tort and are defended by at torneys i n the\nDepa rtment of Justice.\nI. Basics of individual capacity representation\nThe De partment o f Justice (DOJ) has long reco gnized th at personal liability tor t claims agains t\nfederal employees implic ate the interests of the Uni ted States. Acco rdingly, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7  517 authorizes\nDOJ attorneys t o defend these claims in accordance with guidel ines found  at 28 C. F.R. \u00a7\u00a7  50.1 5 and\n50.16. See also USAM \u00a7  4-5.412.\nIndividual  capacity repr esentation is availa ble for current or former f ederal employees who  have\nbeen \u201csued, subpoe naed, or charged i n their individual  capacities.\" 28 C. F.R. \u00a7 50.15 (2010 ). The\nguidel ine, howe ver, do es not define those terms. I n some cases, a complai nt is so poorly dra fted that it is\ndifficult to ascertain if a personal liability claim has been asserted. DOJ  attorneys sh ould look for  three\nthings when  evalu ating a c ase:  (1) whet her the employee is  named i n the caption as required by Fed.  R.\nCIV. P. 10 (a); (2) whether there is an allegatio n that the employee ac ted wrongful ly; and (3) whet her the\nprayer fo r relief seeks moneta ry damag es. If all three of these things a re present in the complai nt, the\nemployee ca n and should request individ ual capacity repr esentation.\nIndividual  capacity repr esentation by a DOJ  attorney is  not mandatory. A f ederal employee m ay\nretain counsel at his own e xpense, but this is rarely done . Most employees prefer representation by a DOJ\nattorney bec ause there is no cost to the employee. T he guid elines require that employees seeking\nindividu al capacity repr esentation mak e a request through thei r employing ag ency. 28 C.F.R.\n\u00a7 50.15(a)(1) (2010). Unl ess the request is \"clearly unwar ranted,\" the agency is o bligated to forward it to\nthe appropriate litigating divisi on, a long with t he court papers served on  the employee and  an \"agency\nstatement.\"  Id. \nUsua lly, requ ests for individu al capacity repr esentation go to  the Civil Di visio n. The\noverwhe lming m ajority of these requests are handled by the  Cons titutional Torts Staff in the Torts\nBranch. The Tax Di visio n, ho wever, o ften handles requests from em ployees a t the Inter nal Revenue\nService i n suits arising fro m their efforts to collect income ta xes. Req uests made in suits challenging th e\nadequacy of medic al care for incarcerated persons, however,  should be directed to the Federal Tort\nClaims Act Staff in the Torts Branch.\nIndividual  capacity repr esentation involves a  two-part test. First, the condu ct giving ris e to the\nclaim must have oc curred whi le the employee was  working withi n the scope of federal employm ent.\nSecond, it must be in the interest of the Uni ted States to assign a DOJ  attorney to provide a  defense for\nNOVEMBER 2010 UNITED STATES ATTORNEYS\u2019 BULLETIN 1\nthe employee. 2 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 50.15(a)(2) (2010); USAM  \u00a7 4-5.412( B). T he litigating divisi on reviews  the\ncomplai nt, the agency sta tement, and any suppor ting documenta tion to determine wh ether these two\nconditions are met. In the overwhel ming m ajority of cases, this review is  routine and the employee's\nrequest is approved a s a matter of course. However,  in difficult or novel cases, and in cases wher e initial\nreview su ggests the request should be denied, the matt er is sent to a higher of fice for a decision. In the\nCivil  Divis ion, these cases are forwa rded to the De puty Assis tant Attorney Gener al, who o verse es the\nTorts Branch. The De puty may, at her option, convene t he Ci vil Di visio n Rep resentation Co mmittee to\nprovide a dditional analysis a nd guid ance.\nIf individual  capacity repr esentation is approved, t he DOJ  attorney ass igned t o defend the\nemployee en ters into a \"full and traditional attorney cl ient relationship,\" and all communication between\nthe employee a nd the department attorney is  privileged. 28  C.F.R. \u00a7  50.1 5(a)(3) (2010). Acc ordingly,\ncare should be taken to ensure that privileged mater ial is clearly ide ntified and segregate d in the case file.\nAgency couns el employed by any DOJ  componen t are also bound  by the  privilege and  should take the\nsame pr ecautions. Id. \nCouns el employed by oth er agenci es, howe ver, ha ve the  option of being bound  by the  privilege.\nId. DOJ  attorneys r epresenting em ployees of  agenci es other than the DOJ  should ascertain early in the\nlitigatio n whe ther agency couns el agree  to be boun d by the  privilege and  must then carefully memoria lize\ncounsels\u2019 decision in the case file. If agency couns el opt out of the privilege, de partment a ttorneys sho uld\ntake car e to avoid  any comm unications with agency cou nsel that might wa ive the privilege.\nThe guid elines on individ ual capacity repr esentation include a number of terms and conditions.\nSee 28 C.F .R. \u00a7 5 0.15(a)(8)-(12)  (2010). These terms and conditions are set forth in the DOJ -399 form,\nwhic h can be obtained from the Con stitutional Torts Staff. DOJ  attorneys r epresenting curr ent or former\nfederal employees in their individ ual capacities should ensure that the client complet es this form and t hat\nit is made part of the case file.\nSome fed eral employees have pu rchased professional liability ins urance. To date, there are three\ncompani es selling thi s coverage:   Fed eral Employees De fense Services , Mass Bene fits Cons ultants, and\nWright USA (formerl y Wri ght & Com pany). Any fede ral employee who s erves as  a \"law enf orcement\nofficer,\" \"superviso r or managem ent official,\" or a \"temporary fire line manager\" is eligible for\nreimburse ment \"not to exceed one-half\" of the premium  paid for professional liability insu rance. 5\nU.S.C.A.

FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT POLICIES & PROCEDURES BULLETIN, No. 0 5-17 (Apr.\n27, 2 005). The DOJ  counsel assigned to  represent federal employees i n their individual  capacities should\ninquire at the outset as to whet her the employee ca rries professional liability insu rance. If so, the carrier\nshould be promptly noti fied of the pending su it and kept i nformed as  the litigation progre sses.\nII. Types of personal liability claims sounding in tort against federal employees\nThree types of  personal liability claims sound ing in  tort are typical ly ass erted agai nst federal\nemployees i n their individual  capacity. Firs t, there are personal liability claims premised upon  an alleged\nviola tion of the Co nstitution. See, e.g., Bivens v. Six Unkn own Name d Age nts of the Fed. Bu reau of    \nNarc otics, 403  U.S. 38 8 (1971 ) (Four th Amendment). Second, there are personal liability claims        \npremised upon a viol ation of a federal statute. See, e.g., Brown v.  Nationsbank Co rp., 188 F.3d 579 (5th\nCir. 199 9) (Rackete er Influenced and Corrupt Organizati ons Act (RICO)) . Finally, th ere are personal\nliability claims premised upon  a viol ation of state tort law. See, e.g., United States v. Smi th, 499 U.S. 16 3\n(1991) (medic al malpractice). The most comm on defense strategies  for each type o f claim will  be\n2 UNITED STATES ATTORNEYS\u2019 BULLETIN NOVEMBER 2010\ncovere d below. For additional cover age of  this topic, refer to the U.S . ATTORNEYS' BULLETIN, No. 5 0,\nVol. 4 (July 200 2).\nIII. Common issues that arise when defending federal employees against personal\nliability constitutional tort claims\nA. Whether  a Bivens remedy shou ld be inferred at all\nIn Bivens v. Six Unkn own Name d Age nts of the Fed. Bu reau of Narc otics, 403  U.S. 38 8 (1971 ),\nthe Supr eme Court  allowe d the district courts to infer a personal liability remedy for  money dam ages\nagains t federal employees who  viola te the Fourth Am endment. Id. at 388. The Supreme Court  cautioned,\nhowever , that wher e there are \"special factors counsel[ing] h esitation,\" it may not be appropriate to infer\na Bivens remedy. Id. at 396. The Co urt later explained that a Bivens remedy doe s not lie in two situations: \n(1) wher e Con gress  has provided  an equally effective al ternative remedy and de clared it to be a substitute\nfor recovery und er the Con stitution; and (2) where, in the absence of affirmati ve act ion by Congress ,\nspecial factors counsel hesitation. Carlson v. Gr een, 446  U.S. 14  (1980).\nLater Supr eme Court  decisions show a  great  reticence to infer the Bivens remedy. I n 1983, the\nCour t declined to infer a Bivens remedy for  a federal employee se eking to l itigate  a constitutional claim\narising in  the context of his employment because the comprehensive remedia l scheme established by the\nCivil  Service Re form Act (CSRA)  constituted a special factor. Bush  v. Lucas, 462 U.S. 36 7 (1983 ). In\n1988 , the Cou rt declined to infer a Bivens remedy for  a plaintiff trying to litigate a  Fifth Amendment\nprocedural due process claim after being deni ed Social Security paym ents because the Social Security\nAct's review p rocess was a special factor. Schweiker v. Ch ilicky, 487 U.S. 41 2 (1988 ). In 2001, the Cour t\ndeclined to infer a Bivens remedy for  an inmate  seeking to a ssert an Eighth  Amendment claim again st a\nprivate p rison contractor because the inmate had an alternative remedy in t he form of a  respondeat\nsuperior negli gence c laim ag ainst the corporation. Corr ectional Services. Cor p. v. Malesko, 534 U.S. 61\n(2001). \nIn 30 years  of Bivens jurisprudence we ha ve ext ended its holding only twi ce, to provide\nan otherwise none xistent cause of action again st individual officers alleged to have ac ted\nunconstitutionally, or  to provide a  cause of action for a plaintiff who l acked any\nalternative reme dy for harms caused by an in divid ual officer's unconstitutional condu ct.\nWhere such circumstances are not present, we  have c onsistently rejected invita tions to\nextend Bivens . . . . \nId. at 70. \nIn 2007, the Co urt stressed that a Bivens remedy for  a claimed con stitutional viol ation \"has to\nrepresent a judgm ent about the best way to i mplement a constitutional guara ntee; it is not an a utomatic\nentitlement  no ma tter what  other mean s there may  be to vindicate a protected interest . . . .\" Wilkie v.\nRobb ins, 551 U.S. 53 7, 55 0 (2007 ) (emphasi s added).\nThe courts of appeals have been  similarly dis inclined to infer a Bivens remedy. I n Arar  v.\nAshc roft, 585 F.3d 559 (2d Cir. 200 9), the Second Circuit, sitting en banc, declined to infer a Bivens\nremedy for  an alien seeking to a ssert a constitutional tort claim again st the Attorney Gene ral and other\nhigh- ranking exec utive bra nch employees arising out  of his extraordinary extr adition from the  United\nStates to a foreign count ry. \nNOVEMBER 2010 UNITED STATES ATTORNEYS\u2019 BULLETIN 3\nIn Wilson v. Libby, 535 F.3d 697 (D.C. Ci r. 2008), the D.C. Ci rcuit considered a personal\nliability cons titutional tort claim brought b y a Cent ral Intel ligence Agenc y em ployee and  her husband\nagains t the V ice President and other senior adminis tration officials. These officials were alleged to have\nimprope rly disc losed the employee's covert  status in retaliation for her husband's protected First\nAmendment activity. T he D.C.  Circuit declined to infer a Bivens remedy bec ause the Privacy Act\nafforded plaintiffs an alternative remedy where  the challenged co nduc t involved wro ngful  dissemination\nof private i nformati on from g overnment r ecords. Id. at 704. \nIn Benz man v . Whitman, 523 F.3d 119 (2d Cir. 200 8), the Second Circuit decided a case in whi ch\nresidents of Manhattan sought t o assert a Fifth Amendment substantive due  process claim again st the\nhead of the Environ mental Protection Agency for  allegedly m isrepresenting the dangers p osed by\nairborne contaminants followin g the t errorist attack on S eptember 11 , 200 1. The Second Ci rcuit declined\nto infer a Bivens remedy bec ause plaintiffs had an alternative remedy in t he form of a  claim again st a\ngovernment fund set up to compensate those injured. Id. at 126. The Co urt explained that \"[a] Bivens\naction is a blunt and power ful instrument for correcting con stitutional viol ations and not an 'automati c\nentitlement' associated with every g overnmenta l infraction.\" Id. at 125.\nIn light o f this decisional authority, DOJ attorneys t hat defend federal employees agains t\npersonal liability, con stitutional tort claims should consider at the outset whet her it is proper for the\ndistrict court to infer the Bivens remedy. Wh ere the plaintiff has another way to l itigate  the propriety of\nthe challenged c ondu ct, a moti on to dismiss s hould be filed urging the d istrict court to eschew inferring a\nBivens remedy. T his type o f moti on wi ll be especially well -taken if  the plaintiff's claim is a nalogous t o\nthe claims at issue in Malesko, Wilkie, Ar ar, Wilson, or Benz man.  Moreover, a lthough t he decisional\nauthority is l ess clear, it is also possible to argue tha t district courts should decline to infer a Bivens\nremedy when the plaintiff can seek rel ief under the Ad ministrative Proc edures Act, the Freedom of\nInformati on Ac t, the Tucker Act, or the Immigration and Nationality Act. DOJ  attorneys en countering\nthese issues should contact the Con stitutional Torts Staff for guidan ce.\nB. Whether qualif ied im munity prote cts the em ployee from  suit on a Bivens claim\nIf the district court infers a Bivens remedy, th e defense of choice is qualified immunity. Alt hough\nsome dec isions still refer to \"good fa ith\" imm unity, th is reference is a misno mer. The qualified immunity\ndefense is who lly obj ective an d no inquiry int o a defendant's subjective good f aith is appropriate. See\nMitchell v. For syth, 472  U.S. 51 1, 51 7 (1985 ) (observing that  Harl ow \u201cpurged qu alified immunity\ndoctrine of its subjective co mpone nts\"); Davi s v. Scherer, 468  U.S. 18 3, 19 1 (1984 ) (observing that\nHarl ow \"rejected the inquiry int o state of mind in favor of  a who lly obj ective st andard\"). The qualified\nimmunity inq uiry rem ains wh olly obj ective even wh en the official's subjective intent is an essential part\nof plaintiff's affirmative ca se. See Crawf ord-El v. Britton, 523  U.S. 57 4, 58 8 (1998 ) (explaining that\nqualified immunity \"may  not be rebutted by eviden ce that the defendant's condu ct was malicious or\notherwise improperly motivated, \" because \"[e]videnc e concerning the d efendant's subjective intent is\nsimply ir relevant t o that defense.\").\n1. Quali fied im munity basics\nQual ified immunity shi elds government o fficials performing di scretionary funct ions from\nliability so l ong as t heir condu ct does not viol ate clearly est ablished statutory or c onstitutional rights, o f\nwhic h a reasonable person woul d have known. See Harl ow v.  Fitzgerald, 457  U.S. 80 0, 81 8 (1982 );\nAnde rson v. Creighton, 483  U.S. 63 5, 64 0 (1987 ). Even employees wh o viol ate the Co nstitution may\nnevert heless be protected from sui t by the d octrine of qualified immunity. See Wilson v. Layne, 526  U.S.\n4 UNITED STATES ATTORNEYS\u2019 BULLETIN NOVEMBER 2010\n603, 614, 618  (1999) (holding th at presence of media during exec ution of a warrant viola ted the Fourth\nAmendment, but grant ing qua lified immunity bec ause the right n ot clearly est ablished).\n2. The concept of \"clearly established l aw\"\nQual ified immunity giv es public officials the benefit of the doubt if the law at  the time of t heir\nconduct did not clearly pro hibit their actions. See Hunt er v. Br yant, 502  U.S. 22 4, 22 9 (1991 ) (per\ncuriam) (describing qual ified immunity as \"accommodation for reasonable error\"). Qual ified immunity\nprovides  \"ample room for mist aken j udgm ents\" and protects all government officials except \"the plainly\nincompetent or those who knowi ngly v iolate the law.\" Malley v. Br iggs, 475  U.S. 33 5, 34 1 (1986 ). Thus,\nofficials are immune from claims for damag es \"as long as t heir actions could reasonably have be en\nthought co nsistent with the rights  they are  alleged to have viol ated.\" Ande rson, 483  U.S. a t 638. \nThe inquiry is whet her reasonable officials, not judges o r constitutional scholars, could have\nthought t he defendant's condu ct permissible under the Con stitution. See Wilson, 526  U.S. a t 618. \" If the\nlaw did not put the officer on n otice that his conduct would be clearly unl awful, summ ary judgm ent\nbased on qualified immunity is appropriate.\" Sauc ier v. Kat z, 533  U.S. 19 4, 20 2 (2001 ).\nWhen gra ppling wit h wha t is \"clearly est ablished,\" the most critical step is properly defi ning the\nright at  issue. The inquiry must be \"fact-specific,\" Ande rson, 483  U.S. a t 641, a nd \"must be unde rtaken i n\nlight of  the specific context of the case, not as a broad gener al propos ition.\" Sauc ier, 533  U.S. a t 201. T o\noverco me qualified immunity, \"t he right t he official is alleged t o have violated must have be en 'clea rly\nestablished' in a more p articularized, a nd hence more r elevant,  sense:  The contours of the right must be\nsufficiently clear that a reasonable official woul d understand that what  he is doing violates that right.\"\nAnde rson, 483  U.S. a t 640. T his rule takes in to account one of the funda mental purposes of qualified\nimmunity, whic h is to bar liability when i t would be \"difficult for an officer to determine how t he\nrelevant l egal d octrine . . . wi ll apply to the factual situation the officer confronts.\" Sauc ier, 533  U.S. a t\n205.\nThe Supreme Court , therefore, has consistently begun it s qualified immunity ana lysis by def ining\nthe claimed right wi th relevant s pecificity. See, e.g., Bros seau v. Hauge n, 543  U.S. 19 4, 19 9, 20 0 (2004 )\n(per curiam) (de fining \"th e situation [the defendant] confronted\" as \"wh ether to shoot a disturbed felon,\nset on a voidi ng capt ure through vehicular flight, when persons in the immediate area are at risk from that\nflight\" ); Wilson, 526  U.S. a t 615 (defining the appropriate question as whet her a reasonable officer could\nhave be lieved t hat bringin g members of the media into a home during the execution of an arrest warrant\nwas lawful, in light of  clearly est ablished law and  the informati on the officers possessed.\"); Conn  v.\nGabbe rt, 526  U.S. 28 6, 29 1 (1999 ) (defining the relevant qu estion as whet her \"use of a search wa rrant by\ngovernment actors viol ates an attorney's right t o practice his profession\"). Thus, although pla intiffs will\noften attempt to  bypass  the second step of qualified immunity by asse rting so me hoary and overl y-genera l\nconstitutional precept, such as \"due process,\" \"free speech,\" or \"reasonableness,\" courts must l ook to\nwhet her, on the particular facts of the case, the right wa s clearly est ablished.\n3. What sort of authority m akes a right clear ly establish ed?\nOnce  the court has defined the specific right at  issue, the next step is to determine wh ether that\nright is  \"clearly est ablished.\" Ande rson, 483  U.S. a t 635-36. It is  too extreme to s ay tha t qualified\nimmunity appl ies unless the very act ion in question has previous ly bee n held unlawful. But, in light of\npre-existing la w, th e unlawfulness must b e apparent. Id. at 640. The \"salient question\" is whe ther the\nofficer had \"fair warning\" or  \"fair notice\" that his or her actions woul d viol ate the law. Hope v. Pe ltzer,\n536 U.S. 73 0, 73 9-41 (2002 ).\nNOVEMBER 2010 UNITED STATES ATTORNEYS\u2019 BULLETIN 5\nWhat constitutes fair warning varies from sit uation to situation. Hope , 536  U.S. a t 740-41. W here\nthe Cons titution itself is specific, the right may be cl early est ablished by the  plain text. See Groh  v.\nRami rez, 540  U.S. 55 1, 56 3 (2004 ) (holding no re asonable officer could believe tha t warrant that did not\nparticularly des cribe objects subject to seizure  could be val id given Fourth Amendment's textual\nrequirement of particularity). Mo st often, ho wever, t he Co nstitution's text is \"cast at a high le vel of\ngenera lity\" such that its application to particular facts will clearly est ablish a governing rule  only in\n\u201cobvious\"  cases. Bros seau, 543  U.S. a t 199.\nTherefore, review of  decisional authority inte rpreting th e constitutional provisi on at issue is\nusually nee ded. See, e.g., Sauc ier, 533  U.S. a t 209 (\"[N]either respondent nor the Cou rt of Appe als has\nidentified any case demonst rating a cl early est ablished rule prohibiting th e officer from acting as he\ndid[.]\") (emphasis added). The decisions need not be \"fundamenta lly\" or \"mater ially sim ilar\" on the facts,\nespecially when egregiou s viol ations are at issue and \u201cofficials can still be on notice that their condu ct\nviola tes established law even i n novel factual circumstances.\" Hope , 536  U.S. a t 741. \nIt is not necessary for  the Supreme Cou rt to have c onsidered the issue being li tigated.  Deci sions\nfrom the courts of appeals can clearly est ablish a constitutional rule. Hope , 536  U.S. a t 741-43\n(examinin g Elevent h Circuit precedent). However , when  the issue is \"one in which the result depends\nvery m uch on the facts of each case,\" an officer cannot have f air notice unless the cases \"squarely\ngovern.\" Bros seau, 543  U.S. a t 201; see also Conn , 526  U.S. a t 291 (holding that  law was not clearly\nestablished wher e cases all dealt with a complet e prohibition of the right t o engage in a certain calling,\nnot the brief interruption that affected plaintiff).\nThe Supreme Court  has identified at least two situations in which caselaw is unlikely to  have \nclearly est ablished a constitutional rule. First, a circuit split on a n issue indicates that the law is not\nclearly est ablished. See Wilson, 526  U.S. a t 618 (\"If judges t hus disagre e on a constitutional question, it\nis unfair to subject police to money dam ages f or picking the l osing sid e of the controver sy.\")  Second,\n\"when an earlier case expressly leaves open whe ther a gener al rule applies to the particular type o f\nconduct at issue,\" the law on  that conduct will not be clearly est ablished unless a later case addresses the\nquestion with \"a very hi gh degree of prior factual particularity . . . .\"  Hope , 536  U.S. a t 741 (quoting\nUnited States v. La nier, 520  U.S. 25 9, 27 0-71 (1997 )).\nAn of ficial remains immune even i f his conduct viol ated other, non-constitutional standards such\nas internal guidel ines, ethical principles, or regulat ions. See Davi s v. Scherer, 468  U.S. 18 3, 19 4-96\n(1984). For  example, in Magluta v. Sampl es, 375 F.3d 1269  (11th Cir. 200 4) (Magluta III) a pretrial\ndetainee brought a  Fifth Amendment, procedural due process claim again st prison managers  after they\ntransferred him to ad ministrative det ention and failed to provide t he periodic review m andated by a\nBure au of Prisons regulat ion. The Eleventh Ci rcuit rejected the detainee's argum ent that viola ting the\nregulat ion was the same as viol ating th e Con stitution. Id. at 1279. The court of appeals held the rule of\ndecision was properly drawn from controlling dec isional authority inte rpreting th e constitutional\nprovisio n at issue rather than the Cod e of Federal Regula tions. Id.\nWhile agency poli cy does  not by it self control the immunity ana lysis, courts sometimes ex amine\nit to see if the law is clearly est ablished. See, e.g., Groh  v. Ra mirez, 540  U.S. 55 1, 56 4 (2004 ). A policy\nproscribing the challenged c ondu ct certainly und ermines any argum ent that the employee was  unaware\nthe conduct was unlawful. See id. On t he other hand, a policy expr essly allowing or r equiring ce rtain\nconduct may  support an officer\u2019s contention that he reasonably bel ieved his  conduct to be constitutional.\nSee Wilson v. La yne, 526  U.S. 60 3, 61 7 (1999 ). It is  import ant to note, however,  that the agency poli cy\nmust be read agains t the decisional authority. See Hope v. Pe ltzer, 536  U.S. 73 0, 74 4 (2002 ) (opining that\n6 UNITED STATES ATTORNEYS\u2019 BULLETIN NOVEMBER 2010\nregulat ion appeared to be sham in light of  mandates in caselaw); Wilson, 526  U.S. a t 617-18 (holding that\nofficers could rely on pol icy only wher e caselaw \"wa s at best undevelop ed\").\n4. Quali fied im munity is m ore t han a d efense to liabil ity\nQual ified immunity pro tects not only again st liability but  also from tri al and even f rom\ndiscovery. Siegert v. Gilley, 500  U.S. 22 6, 23 2 (1991 ) (explaining that  qualified immunity pro tects\nofficials from \"expensive and t ime cons uming pr eparation to defend the suit on its merits\" and from \"not\nonly unwarr anted liability, but u nwar ranted demands customarily imposed upon those defending a l ong\ndrawn out  lawsui t\"). Litigation diverts energy and resources from pressing pub lic problems, the  threat of\npersonal liability dis courages ca pable people from assuming publ ic positions, and the fear of suit may\ndeter officials from exer cising judgm ent with the decisiveness  critical to their offices. See Harl ow v.\nFitzgerald, 457  U.S. 80 0, 81 4 (1982 ). Be cause litigatio n imposes these costs whet her or not liability is\nimposed , qua lified immunity \"is an immun ity from s uit rather than a mere defense to liability.\" Mitchell v.\nFors yth, 472  U.S. 51 1, 52 6 (1985 ). Also, because these costs begin to  accrue as soon as a case has been\nfiled, the Supreme Court  \"repeatedly ha[s ] stressed the importance of resolving im munity ques tions at the\nearliest possible stage in  litigatio n.\" Hunt er v. Br yant, 502  U.S. 22 4, 22 7 (1991 ); see also Sauc ier v. Ka tz,\n533 U.S. 19 4, 20 0 (2001 ) (\"Where the defendant seeks qua lified immunity, a r uling on th at issue should\nbe made e arly in the proceedings so t hat the costs and expenses of trial are avoide d whe re the defense is\ndispositive.\" ) If a de fendant raises qualified immunity in a motio n to dismiss o r a prediscovery m otion\nfor summ ary judgm ent, then \"[u]ntil this threshold immunity ques tion is resolved, d iscovery sho uld not\nbe allowed. \" Harl ow, 457  U.S. a t 818; see also Crawf ord-El v. Britton, 523  U.S. 57 4, 59 8 (1988 )\n(explaining that  \"if the defendant does plead the immunity def ense, the district court should resolve that\nthreshold question before permitting dis covery\") .\n5. The anal ytical fram ework f or qualif ied im munity\nAs no ted above, th e qualified immunity test contains two steps. For  many years , the Supreme\nCour t mandat ed that the \"initial inquiry\" must b e whe ther the officer's condu ct viola ted a constitutional\nright. Sauc ier, 533 U.S. at  201. If no constitutional right wa s viol ated, then \"there is no n ecessity for\nfurther inquiries concerning quali fied immunity.\" Id. But, \"if a viol ation could be made o ut on a\nfavorabl e view o f the parties' subm issions,\" then \u201cthe next, sequential step is to ask whethe r the right wa s\nclearly est ablished.\" Id. \nDuring the 1990 s, the Supreme Court  warned again st skipp ing ahe ad to the second step and\ninsisted lower  courts begin wit h the initial inquiry int o whe ther the challenged co nduc t was\nconstitutional. Siegert v. Gilley, 500  U.S. 22 6, 23 2 (1991 ) (criticizing th e court of appeals for assuming,\nwithout deciding, the  \"preliminary issue\" of whether the plaintiff had alleged a c onstitutional viola tion);\nsee also Co unty of Sacrame nto v. Lewis, 523  U.S. 83 3, 84 1 (1998 ) (explaining that  \u201c[t]he first step is to\nidentify the  exact contours of the underlying ri ght sa id to have be en viol ated\u201d). The Co urt explained that\naddressing the steps in order advanc ed \"the law's elaboration from case to case\" by ensu ring cour ts will\n\"set forth principles whic h will become the basis for a holding that  the right i s clearly est ablished.\"\nSauc ier v. Kat z, 533  U.S. 19 4, 20 1 (2001 ). Otherwise, the Co urt reasoned, \"standards of official condu ct\nwoul d tend to remain uncertain, to the detriment b oth of officials and individual s.\" Lewi s, 523  U.S. a t\n842.\nIn recent years , howe ver, t he Co urt expressed increasing skept icism over r igid a pplication of the\nSauc ier test. In fact, in some ca ses the Cou rt failed to follow its own i nstruction altogethe r. See, e.g.,\nBros seau v. Hau gen, 543  U.S. 19 4, 19 8 (2004 ) (expressing \"no view\" on the constitutional question itself\nNOVEMBER 2010 UNITED STATES ATTORNEYS\u2019 BULLETIN 7\nand instead concluding that  \"however that question is decided, the Cou rt of Appe als was wrong on t he\nissue of qualified immunity\"); Sauc ier, 533  U.S. a t 207-08 (assuming viola tion could have occu rred on\nfacts alleged an d proceeding dir ectly to assessment of clearly est ablished law).\nBy 2008, a t least four sitting J ustices had signaled  support for a more f lexible approach.

Schott, J.D. Law enforcement personnel expose themselves to risks every day. Those risks include the possibility of being sued civilly for something they did while performing law enforcement duties. While acting in the scope of their employment, federal, state, and local officers can be sued for intentionally violating a person\u2019s constitutional rights.1Like anyone else facing a lawsuit, officers have various defenses available to assert in their defense. Of course, these include all of the traditional defenses available in a civil case.2 Additionally, law enforcement personnel are protected by the doctrine of qualified immunity. In 1982, 11 years after its Bivens decision, the Supreme Court provided the modern standard for determining whether a government employee is entitled to qualified immunity.3 Since then, the test for whether qualified immunity is appropriate in a particular case has been applied differently, but the scope of its protection has remained unchanged. Over the past 12 years, the Supreme Court has provided additional guidance regarding the protection afforded by qualified immunity, including three cases decided this past term. This article will provide a historical discussion of the doctrine of qualified immunity, review the changes the Supreme Court has provided to determine whether qualified immunity should apply in a particular case, and summarize three very recent Supreme Court cases addressing this issue and how these decisions impact the law enforcement community.Qualified Immunity DoctrineClearly Established LawWhile law enforcement officers recognize the inherent risks of their occupation, they should be comforted by the description given by the Supreme Court as to the effect of the qualified immunity doctrine on one of those inherent risks\u2014that of being sued civilly. In Harlow v. Fitzgerald, the Court explained that \u201cgovernment officials performing discretionary functions generally are shielded from liability for civil damages insofar as their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.\u201d4 The plaintiff in Harlow, A. Ernest Fitzgerald, sued, among others, President Richard M. Nixon and one of his aides, Bryce Harlow, alleging that he was dismissed from his employment with the Air Force in violation of his First Amendment and other statutory rights. Special Agent Schott is a legal instructor at the FBI Academy. The defendants sought immunity from the lawsuit. While ruling on the issue of immunity, the Supreme Court distinguished the president from his aide. First, the Court noted that its \u201cdecisions consistently have held that government officials are entitled to some form of immunity from suits for damages. As recognized at common law, public officers require this protection to shield them from undue interference with their duties and from potentially disabling threats of liability.\u201d5 Justice Powell, writing for the Court, continued by recognizing that:[o]ur decisions have recognized immunity defenses of two kinds. For officials whose special functions or constitutional status requires complete protection from suit, we have recognized the defense of \u201cabsolute immunity.\u201d The absolute immunity of legislators, in their legislative functions, and of judges, in their judicial functions, now is well settled. Our decisions also have extended absolute immunity to certain officials of the Executive Branch. These include prosecutors and similar officials, executive officers engaged in adjudicative functions, and the President of the United States. For executive officials in general, however, our cases make plain that qualified immunity represents the norm. [W]e [have] acknowledged that high officials require greater protection than those with less complex discretionary responsibilities.6 Based on this reasoning, Harlow\u2014Nixon\u2019s aide\u2014was entitled not to absolute immunity, but, rather, to qualified immunity.The Court then reexamined its earlier treatment of qualified immunity. Prior to this case, qualified or \u201cgood faith\u201d immunity included both an objective and a subjective aspect. The subjective aspect involved determining whether the government actor in question took his \u201caction with the malicious intention to cause a deprivation of constitutional rights or other injury.\u201d7 This subjective determination typically would require discovery and testimony to establish whether malicious intention was present. Having to go through the costly process of discovery and trial, however, conflicted with the goal of qualified immunity to allow for the \u201cdismissal of insubstantial lawsuits without trial.\u201d8Recognizing this dilemma, the Court altered the test to determine whether qualified immunity was appropriate. The new test, as stated earlier, is that \u201cgovernment officials performing discretionary functions generally are shielded from liability for civil damages insofar as their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.\u201d9 By applying the reasonable person standard, the Supreme Court established, for the first time, a purely objective standard to determine whether granting a government official qualified immunity was appropriate.While Harlow did not involve a law enforcement officer\u2019s actions, the decision is significant because law enforcement officers are government officials who perform discretionary functions and may be protected by qualified immunity. This shield of immunity is an objective test designed to protect all but \u201cthe plainly incompetent or those who knowingly violate the law.\u201d10 Stated differently (but just as comforting to law enforcement officers), officers are not liable for damages \u201cas long as their actions reasonably could have been thought consistent with the rights they are alleged to have violated.\u201d11 As protective as the language in these post-Harlow cases would suggest qualified immunity is, qualified immunity is not appropriate if a law enforcement officer violates a clearly established constitutional right.For example, in Groh v. Ramirez, a special agent for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF) applied for and received from a U.S. magistrate judge a search warrant authorizing the search of a home located on a ranch.12 The purpose of the search was to locate and seize a \u201cstockpile of firearms.\u201d13 While the magistrate judge had reviewed a detailed itemization of the firearms in the application for the search warrant, the search warrant itself did not include any such itemization. Rather, the ATF agent inadvertently \u201ctyped a description of respondent\u2019s two-story blue house rather than the alleged stockpile of firearms.\u201d14The homeowner sued the ATF agent for a violation of his Fourth Amendment right to be free from \u201cunreasonable searches and seizures.\u201d15 Of course, the Fourth Amendment also mandates that search warrants \u201cparticularly describ[e] the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.\u201d16 Despite this clear mandate, the ATF defendant to the civil lawsuit argued that he was entitled to qualified immunity because even if the improperly written search warrant constituted a Fourth Amendment violation, his failure to include a particular description did not violate a clearly established right at the time. The Court quickly dispatched the notion that the inadequate warrant was simply a \u201ctechnical mistake or typographical error\u201d that did not rise to the level of a constitutional violation.17 Finding the violation, the Court turned to whether the right was clearly established at the time the violation occurred.The Supreme Court used decisive language to show that the homeowner\u2019s rights had been clearly established before the violation in this particular case occurred. The Court pointed out that \u201cthe particularity requirement is set forth in the text of the Constitution.\u201d18 The Court then referred to a previous decision by the Court in this area, stating, \u201cas we noted nearly 20 years ago in Sheppard: \u2018The uniformly applied rule is that a search conducted pursuant to a warrant that fails to conform to the particularity requirement of the Fourth Amendment is unconstitutional.\u2019\u201d19 Accordingly, the request for qualified immunity was rejected.Constitutional Violation/Objective ReasonablenessEven if the law is clearly established, the law enforcement officer is entitled to qualified immunity if there was no constitutional violation in the first place. For example, in County of Sacramento v. Lewis, the deputies involved in a fatal high-speed pursuit were sued by the decedent\u2019s parents for a due process violation.20 The alleged constitutional violation was due process because the decedent was not intentionally seized by the deputies, but, rather, accidentally struck by one of the deputies after the motorcycle being pursued crashed in front of the pursuing deputies. The decedent, in fact, had merely been a passenger on the motorcycle. The Supreme Court afforded the deputies qualified immunity because even when based on a favorable view of the plaintiffs\u2019 allegations, there simply was no violation of due process. The court noted that to violate the Due Process Clause, the deputies had to intend to cause harm, and that had not been the case.21 Rather, the [deputy\u2019s] \u201cinstinct was to do his job as a law enforcement officer, not to induce [the decedent\u2019s] lawlessness, or to terrorize, cause harm, or kill.\u201d22While the two determinations into whether qualified immunity should apply have been well-settled, which of the two separate inquiries to analyze first has not been.Application of the Qualified Immunity TestAlmost 30 years after the Supreme Court provided the objective test to determine whether qualified immunity should be afforded a defendant, it provided specific, if only short-lived, guidance on how and in what order to apply the two-part test. In Saucier v. Katz, a protestor at an event that included Vice President Albert Gore, Jr., was arrested by a military police officer.23 The arrested protestor sued the officer, alleging that during the arrest, excessive force was used, which violated his Fourth Amendment rights. The officer\u2019s request for qualified immunity was denied by both the district court and by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.24 In denying qualified immunity on the issue of excessive force, the Ninth Circuit first found that the \u201claw governing the official\u2019s conduct was clearly established,\u201d focusing on the general right to be free from excessive force.25 The Ninth Circuit then concluded that the reasonableness inquiry into the amount of force used should be determined by a jury, ruling out qualified immunity for the officer.The Supreme Court disagreed with the Ninth Circuit and pointed out that its reasoning would contravene the purpose of granting qualified immunity at an early stage of court proceedings \u201cso that the costs and expenses of trial are avoided where the defense is dispositive.\u201d26 To satisfy this purpose, the Supreme Court ruled that the first inquiry into a request for qualified immunity must be whether a constitutional right would have been violated on the facts alleged; then, and only if the answer to the first inquiry is affirmative, does the question of whether the right was clearly established at the time of the alleged violation have to be answered. The Supreme Court also disagreed with the Ninth Circuit\u2019s rationale that only a jury could decide whether the force used in this instance was excessive, making its two-step approach workable even in excessive force claims.27While the Supreme Court\u2019s guidance in Saucier provided a mandatory two-inquiry test to be used for future qualified immunity cases and while that test was effective for the facts at hand, rigid compliance to the two-step inquiry soon fell out of favor. Lower courts struggled to apply Saucier because it was not always practical to decide whether a constitutional violation occurred before addressing whether the constitutional right at issue had been clearly established. While some lower courts began deviating from the Supreme Court\u2019s rigid two-inquiry approach, others were at least expressing frustration with it.28 Even the Supreme Court itself did not always see fit to follow its own mandate. In Brousseau v. Haugen, another excessive force allegation against a law enforcement officer was resolved by affording the officer qualified immunity.29 However, in finding qualified immunity appropriate, the Court deviated from its own pronouncement from three\u00a0years earlier in Saucier. In a per curium opinion in Brousseau, the Court found in this case that the officer\u2019s use of force\u2014shooting an unarmed but \u201cdisturbed felon, set on avoiding capture through vehicular flight\u201d\u2014fell in the \u201chazy border between excessive and acceptable force.\u201d30Because of the close-call nature as to whether the amount of force used was reasonable, the Court granted qualified immunity based on the lack of a clearly established right, rather than any possible constitutional violation or lack thereof. Based on the Supreme Court\u2019s earlier decision in Saucier, however, that was exactly the dilemma the Ninth Circuit found itself in when deciding Brousseau.31 Recognizing that it was not only the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals that found itself in the position\u2014\u201cunnecessarily to decide difficult constitutional questions when there [was] available an easier basis for the decision\u201d\u2014of whether qualified immunity should apply, the Supreme Court modified the mandatory formula it set forth in Saucier.32In 2009, the Supreme Court decided Pearson v. Callahan.33 The case involved the warrantless arrest of a subject at his home immediately following his sale of illegal drugs to a police informant. The arresting officers relied on the notion of \u201cconsent once removed\u201d to make entry into the home following the informant\u2019s drug purchase. The arrested homeowner sued the arresting officers, asserting that the warrantless entry of his home was a Fourth Amendment violation, arguing that \u201cconsent once removed\u201d was limited to an undercover officer being invited in and that it did not apply in cases where an informant was invited in.The officers requested qualified immunity. The district court deemed that they were entitled to immunity. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit methodically applied the two-pronged inquiry handed down by the Supreme Court six\u00a0years earlier and determined that the grant of qualified immunity was improper.34 Recognizing that the \u201cSaucier procedure has been criticized by Members of this Court and by lower court judges, who have been required to apply the procedure in a great variety of cases and thus have much firsthand experience bearing on its advantages and disadvantages,\u201d the Court, in granting certiorari, \u201cdirected the parties to address the question whether Saucier should be overruled.\u201d35 A unanimous Court softened the mandatory nature of the Saucier approach, receding from without totally abandoning it. Justice Alito, writing for the entire Court, stated that \u201c[o]n reconsidering the procedure required in Saucier, we conclude that, while the sequence set forth there is often appropriate, it should no longer be regarded as mandatory. The judges of the district courts and the courts of appeals should be permitted to exercise their sound discretion in deciding which of the two prongs of the qualified immunity analysis should be addressed first in light of the circumstances in the particular case at hand.\u201d36 Not surprisingly, in the case before them, the Court found the issue of qualified immunity easier to determine based on whether any violation (if one occurred at all) was of a clearly established right. Here, the Court found that at the time of the officers\u2019 actions, it was not clearly established that those actions were unlawful.37With the now-flexible Saucier test in place for three\u00a0years, the Supreme Court has ruled on three qualified immunity cases involving law enforcement/public safety personnel in just the past several months.2012 Qualified Immunity CasesIn Messerschmidt v. Millender, the Supreme Court ruled that officers were entitled to qualified immunity.38 Like the Groh v. Ramirez case discussed earlier, this case involved officers executing a search warrant later determined to be invalid.39 A detailed review of the facts leading up to the civil lawsuit at issue in Messerschmidt is required to appreciate the Court\u2019s holding.40When Shelly Kelly decided to leave her boyfriend Jerry Ray Bowen, she requested the presence of Los Angeles County, California, Sheriff\u2019s Department officers while she packed her things because of Bowen\u2019s past violent actions against her and others. When the officers got called away, Bowen showed up, and a violent encounter ensued. Kelly was able to get to her car and attempted to flee. However, before she could, Bowen got a black, sawed-off shotgun with a pistol grip, ran in front of Kelly\u2019s car, pointed the gun at her, and told her that if she tried to leave, he would kill her. When she sped away, Bowen fired at the car five times, blowing out the car\u2019s left front tire, but did not prevent her escape. Kelly found police officers, described the incident, and mentioned that Bowen was a member of the Mona Park Crips\u2014a local street gang\u2014and provided a picture of Bowen.The named defendant in the subsequent civil lawsuit, Detective Curt Messerschmidt, was assigned to investigate. Kelly provided to Messerschmidt the address of Bowen\u2019s foster mother as a probable location for him. She also advised him of Bowen\u2019s gang connections. Through independent investigation, Messerschmidt confirmed Bowen\u2019s connection to the foster mother\u2019s address and that Bowen was an active gang member. In reviewing Bowen\u2019s 17-page criminal history, Messershmidt learned that Bowen had been arrested on at least 31 occasions, including nine times for firearms offenses.Based on his investigation, Messerschmidt obtained a search warrant for the foster mother\u2019s home, authorizing the search for and seizure of, among other items, \u201cAll handguns, rifles, or shotguns of any caliber, or any firearms capable of firing ammunition, or firearms or devices modified or designed to allow it [sic] to fire ammunition. Any firearm capable of firing or chambered to fire any caliber ammunition. Articles of evidence showing street gang membership or affiliation with any Street Gang to include but not limited to any reference to \u2018Mona Park Crips,\u2019 including writings or graffiti depicting gang membership, activity, or identity.\u201d41Messerchmidt prepared two affidavits to support his warrant request. The first described Messerschmidt\u2019s extensive law enforcement experience, including his lengthy work involving gang-related crimes. The second affidavit, which was expressly incorporated into the search warrant, described the incident between Bowen and Kelly in great detail, to include a discussion of the sawed-off shotgun used in the assault. The affidavit also requested that the search be allowed to take place at night because of Bowen\u2019s gang ties. \u201cThe affidavit concluded by noting that Messerschmidt \u2018believe[d] that the items sought\u2019 would be in Bowen\u2019s possession and that \u2018recovery of the weapon could be invaluable in the successful prosecution of the suspect involved in this case, and the curtailment of further crimes being committed.\u2019\u201d42 Before submitting the application and affidavits to a magistrate, a sergeant and a lieutenant in Messerschmidt\u2019s department, as well as an assistant district attorney, reviewed Messerschmidt\u2019s work. A magistrate issued the warrant, and officers executed the search two days later. The officers, including Detective Messerschmidt, seized only the foster mother\u2019s shotgun, a box of .45 caliber ammunition, and a California Social Services letter addressed to Bowen.The Millenders (Bowen\u2019s foster mother and her daughter) subsequently filed a civil lawsuit in federal court suing, among others, Detective Messerschmidt, alleging that the search warrant at issue was invalid under the Fourth Amendment. The federal district court ruled against the individual defendants as to qualified immunity and found that the \u201cwarrant\u2019s authorization to search for firearms was unconstitutionally overbroad because the \u2018crime specified here was a physical assault with a very specific weapon\u2019\u2014a black sawed-off shotgun with a pistol grip\u2014negating any need to \u2018search for all firearms.\u2019\u201d43 The district court also found the warrant overbroad in that it allowed for the seizure of gang-related materials, but there \u201cwas no evidence that the crime at issue was gang-related.\u201d44On appeal to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, the three-judge panel reversed, finding that the officers were entitled to qualified immunity because \u201cthey reasonably relied on the approval of the warrant by a deputy district attorney and a judge.\u201d45 However, the en banc Court of Appeals granted a rehearing and reversed the three-judge panel, denying qualified immunity because the affidavits and warrant \u201cfailed to \u2018establish probable cause that the broad categories of firearms, firearm-related material, and gang-related material described in the warrant were contraband or evidence of crime.\u2019\u201d46The Supreme Court began its analysis of the qualified immunity issue by pointing out that \u201c[w]here the alleged Fourth Amendment violation involves a search or seizure pursuant to a warrant, the fact that a neutral magistrate has issued a warrant is the clearest indication that the officers acted in an objectively reasonable manner or, as we have sometimes put it, in \u2018objective good faith.\u2019\u201d47 But, Chief Justice Roberts, writing for the majority, goes on to say that the magistrate\u2019s issuance of a warrant is not the end of the qualified immunity inquiry. Qualified immunity still will \u201cbe lost, for example, where the warrant was \u2018based on an affidavit so lacking in indicia of probable cause as to render official belief in its existence entirely unreasonable.\u2019\u201d48 The Court did not find this to be the situation in this case. Accordingly, the Court found that qualified immunity was appropriate.With respect to the authorization to seize all firearms, the Court noted that \u201cit would not be unreasonable for an officer to conclude that there was a \u2018fair probability\u2019 that the sawed-off shotgun was not the only firearm Bowen owned,\u201d and it \u201ccertainly would have been reasonable for an officer to assume that Bowen\u2019s sawed-off shotgun was illegal.\u201d49 Therefore, Chief Justice Roberts continued, \u201ca reasonable officer could conclude that there would be additional illegal guns among others that Bowen owned.\u201d50 Chief Justice Roberts also explained that a reasonable officer could believe that seizing all firearms rather than just the sawed-off shotgun could be necessary to prevent Bowen from using a different weapon to do harm to Kelly.\u00a0Chief Justice Roberts then turned to the authority to seize gang paraphernalia during the search. Following a brief discussion of the potential uses for evidence of Bowen\u2019s membership in a gang, Roberts concludes by simply stating, \u201c[w]hatever the use to which evidence of Bowen\u2019s gang involvement might ultimately have been put, it would not have been \u2018entirely unreasonable\u2019 for an officer to believe that the facts set out in the affidavit established a fair probability that such evidence would aid the prosecution of Bowen for the criminal acts at issue.\u201d51Because reasonable officers could have reached these conclusions on the items to be seized, it cannot be said that the officers in this case violated anyone\u2019s clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known. Therefore, the Court did not have to determine whether the facts presented in the affidavits\u2014alone or taken together\u2014actually did establish probable cause. The Court pointed out that this is because the \u201c\u2018officers\u2019 judgment that the scope of the warrant was supported by probable cause may have been mistaken, but it was not \u2018plainly incompetent.\u2019\u201d52 This is consistent with one of the goals of qualified immunity, which is to \u201cgive government officials breathing room to make reasonable but mistaken judgments.\u201d53The Supreme Court decided two other qualified immunity cases shortly after ruling in Messerschmidt. In Filarsky v. Delia, the city of Rialto, California, hired Steve Filarsky, a private attorney, to assist in the internal investigation into one of its firefighters named Nicholas Delia.54 The city suspected that the firefighter remained on medical leave when he was capable of returning to work. The city initiated surveillance on Delia and observed him purchasing building supplies. Thinking Delia was doing a project at his home, rather than returning to work, the city ordered him to appear for an interview where Filarsky was present. After confronting Delia with their suspicions, fire department officials asked for consent to search Delia\u2019s home to see whether the work was ongoing or completed. He refused to provide consent, but was compelled by the department to produce the building materials onto his lawn so that the city officials could be sure he had not been working at his home during his medical-related absence from work.Delia brought a civil lawsuit against numerous individuals, including the private attorney, for a violation of his Fourth Amendment rights. Initially, the federal district court granted summary judgment to all of the individual defendants based on qualified immunity because there had not been a violation of a clearly established right.55 However, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals concluded that while the order to produce the materials from his home onto his lawn did violate Delia\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights, the court ruled that all defendants except for Filarsky, the private attorney, were entitled to qualified immunity because that right was not clearly established at the time the order was given.56 Finding no dispute that qualified immunity was appropriate in the case, the Supreme Court agreed only to determine whether the private attorney also was entitled to its protection even though he worked for the government on something other than a permanent or full-time basis.The Supreme Court found no reason to differentiate between the other defendants in this case and Filarsky. In fact, the Court found several reasons for treating them the same. Among those reasons was that \u201c[a]ffording immunity not only to public employees but also to others acting on behalf of the government similarly serves to \u2018ensure that talented candidates [are] not deterred by the threat of damages suits from entering public service.\u2019\u201d57 The Court noted the hypocrisy that would result if some people doing a job for the government could be sued personally, while government employees performing the same tasks would be protected by qualified immunity.Finally, the Supreme Court also entertained a qualified immunity case involving Secret Service Vice Presidential Protective Detail members in Reichle v. Howards.58 The issue in the case was not whether the Secret Service agents had probable cause to arrest, but whether they were immune from the suit that alleged the arrest was in retaliation for political speech protected by the First Amendment.The defendants in the civil suit were Secret Service agents assigned to protect Vice President Richard Cheney while he visited a shopping mall in Beaver Creek, Colorado, in 2006. When one of the agents overheard Steven Howards say he was going to ask the vice president an inflammatory question, the agents watched Howards closely. The agents saw Howards approach Cheney, make a comment to him, and touch the vice president before walking away. When questioned by the agents, he denied touching the vice president. Howards was arrested and charged with harassment under Colorado law. That charge was dismissed, but Howards brought a civil lawsuit claiming both First and Fourth Amendment violations. After the U.S. District Court for the District of Utah denied the agents\u2019 request for qualified immunity, the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit concluded that because the agents had probable cause to arrest Howards, they enjoyed qualified immunity from the Fourth Amendment claim. However, the Tenth Circuit denied qualified immunity as to the First Amendment allegation. The Supreme Court reversed, affording qualified immunity from the First Amendment allegation as well.The Court used its prerogative of first considering the \u201cclearly established\u201d prong of the two-prong inquiry into whether qualified immunity was available in reaching its conclusion. To be clearly established, the Court reminded, \u201ca right must be sufficiently clear \u2018that every reasonable official would [have understood] that what he was doing violates that right.\u2019\u201d59 Because \u201c[t]his Court has never recognized a First Amendment right to be free from a retaliatory arrest that is supported by probable cause[,] nor was such a right otherwise clearly established at the time of Howards\u2019 arrest,\u201d it stood to reason that the Secret Service agents involved in Howards\u2019 arrest were entitled to qualified immunity.60ConclusionLaw enforcement is a difficult profession. It presents many challenges and risks, as well as great rewards, to those who undertake it. One of the risks associated with law enforcement is the possibility of being sued civilly for an action taken in the course and scope of one\u2019s employment. In an effort to mitigate the costs and burden of defending oneself from a lawsuit, government actors are entitled to assert immunity as a barrier to being sued. For law enforcement officers, the level of immunity available is qualified immunity. As the name implies, this type of immunity is protective, but is not an absolute guarantee against successfully being sued. It is comforting, though, to know that the purpose of qualified immunity is to protect all but \u201cthe plainly incompetent or those who knowingly violate the law.\u201d61 As this article has demonstrated, the test to determine whether qualified immunity should be afforded officers has changed over the years, but the objective nature of the doctrine itself has remained unchanged for nearly 30 years. This objective determination often shields competent law enforcement officers from defending a suit itself, much less from being found liable at the conclusion of a suit. Endnotes1 42 U.S.C. \u00a71983 provides this statutory remedy against state and local law enforcement officers, while the Supreme Court created the same cause of action to be taken against federal law enforcement agents in Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of Federal Bureau of Narcotics, 403 U.S. 388 (1971). For a full discourse on the cause of action itself and the elements required for the officer or agent to be found liable, see R. Schott, \u201cDouble Exposure: Civil Liability and Criminal Prosecution in Federal Court for Police Misconduct,\u201d FBI Law Enforcement Bulletin, May 2008, 23-32.2 Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b) sets forth the time frame and the required manner in which to assert traditional defenses, such as \u201clack of subject matter jurisdiction,\u201d \u201cimproper venue,\u201d and \u201cfailure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.\u201d The rule also makes clear that \u201c[i]f a pleading sets out a claim for relief that does not require a responsive pleading, an opposing party may assert at trial any defense to that claim.\u201d3 Supra note 1; and Harlow v.

ClarificationThe U.S. Department of Justice\u2019s Office of Tribal Justice and the FBI\u2019s Legal Instruction Unit, Office of General Counsel, provide the following clarification to the article \u201cIndian Country and the Tribal Law and Order Act of 2010\u201d that appeared in the May 2012 issue. The article states that the Metlakatla Tribe is not subject to PL-280. That is not accurate. All Indian country in Alaska is subject to PL-280, including the Metlakatla Tribe\u2019s reservation. In Alaska and other areas subject to PL-280, tribes still possess authority to exercise criminal jurisdiction if they so choose. The Tribal Law and Order Act (TLOA) encourages but does not grant cross-deputization for law enforcement officers working in Indian country. The article incorrectly states that the Indian Civil Rights Act of 1968 (ICRA) prohibits the use of the exclusionary rule in tribal courts. In fact, the ICRA does not prohibit the use of the exclusionary rule in tribal courts. Also, the Major Crimes Act includes two additional criminal offenses that did not appear in the article: felony child abuse and neglect. Finally, while the TLOA provides for many important changes in the Indian country criminal justice system, the Act did not appropriate any funding for implementation.Also, the editorial staff would like to advise readers that the word \u201cThey\u201d was left out of the first sentence on page 18 of the article \u201cPicketers, Protesters, and Police: The First Amendment and Investigative Activity\u201d that appeared in the August 2012 issue. The sentence should have read, \u201cThey involve war protesters, death penalty protesters, persons participating in labor disputes, and political protesters and take the form of marches, rallies, and boycotts.\u201d The sentence in the August issue has been corrected in the online version.

Jones | Court DecisionsLegal InformationNon-Compete and Trade SecretsWage & Hour Issues Empower Your Business: Subscribe to our News & Updates for Practical Solutions Subscribe Home Our Blog Share post Print post The Supreme Court of the United States\u2019 (SCOTUS) decision last week in Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo marks a significant change in the legal landscape with respect to courts\u2019 authority to review rules and regulations issued by federal agencies. While this decision is unlikely to affect California courts\u2019 deference to California agencies, it gives employers greater opportunity to successfully challenge federal agency rulemaking in court. In a 6-3 decision, SCOTUS overruled Chevron v. Natural Resources Defense Council, which for the past 40 years required courts to defer to an agency\u2019s permissible interpretation of a statute if the statute was silent or ambiguous as to the precise issue in question. Chevron deference, the Court reasoned, is irreconcilable with the federal Administrative Procedure Act (APA), which commands that the reviewing court, not the agency, must decide all relevant questions of law. SCOTUS\u2019s decision in Loper Bright Enterprises gives courts the authority to exercise independent judgment in interpreting statutes, even where the statute is ambiguous. Consistent with the APA, courts may seek aid from the agency\u2019s interpretation and subject matter expertise, but courts must ensure the agency has engaged in reasoned decision-making within the boundaries of authority delegated to it by statute. Employers are likely to see challenges to a number of federal rules and regulations, including EEOC regulations implementing the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act, the FTC\u2019s non-compete ban, the pending appeal of the decision striking down the NLRB\u2019s new joint employment rule, and pending challenges to the new DOL rule increasing salary basis for exempt status under FLSA. This decision is unlikely to influence how California courts defer to California agencies. California courts continue to use the \u201cvariable deference\u201d test, under which courts typically follow an agency\u2019s interpretation of applicable law, with the degree of deference depending on factors specific to each case.

Us ually, th ese claims sound  in tort and are defended by at torneys i n the\nDepa rtment of Justice.\nI. Basics of individual capacity representation\nThe De partment o f Justice (DOJ) has long reco gnized th at personal liability tor t claims agains t\nfederal employees implic ate the interests of the Uni ted States. Acco rdingly, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7  517 authorizes\nDOJ attorneys t o defend these claims in accordance with guidel ines found  at 28 C. F.R. \u00a7\u00a7  50.1 5 and\n50.16. See also USAM \u00a7  4-5.412.\nIndividual  capacity repr esentation is availa ble for current or former f ederal employees who  have\nbeen \u201csued, subpoe naed, or charged i n their individual  capacities.\" 28 C. F.R. \u00a7 50.15 (2010 ). The\nguidel ine, howe ver, do es not define those terms. I n some cases, a complai nt is so poorly dra fted that it is\ndifficult to ascertain if a personal liability claim has been asserted. DOJ  attorneys sh ould look for  three\nthings when  evalu ating a c ase:  (1) whet her the employee is  named i n the caption as required by Fed.  R.\nCIV. P. 10 (a); (2) whether there is an allegatio n that the employee ac ted wrongful ly; and (3) whet her the\nprayer fo r relief seeks moneta ry damag es. If all three of these things a re present in the complai nt, the\nemployee ca n and should request individ ual capacity repr esentation.\nIndividual  capacity repr esentation by a DOJ  attorney is  not mandatory. A f ederal employee m ay\nretain counsel at his own e xpense, but this is rarely done . Most employees prefer representation by a DOJ\nattorney bec ause there is no cost to the employee. T he guid elines require that employees seeking\nindividu al capacity repr esentation mak e a request through thei r employing ag ency. 28 C.F.R.\n\u00a7 50.15(a)(1) (2010). Unl ess the request is \"clearly unwar ranted,\" the agency is o bligated to forward it to\nthe appropriate litigating divisi on, a long with t he court papers served on  the employee and  an \"agency\nstatement.\"  Id. \nUsua lly, requ ests for individu al capacity repr esentation go to  the Civil Di visio n. The\noverwhe lming m ajority of these requests are handled by the  Cons titutional Torts Staff in the Torts\nBranch. The Tax Di visio n, ho wever, o ften handles requests from em ployees a t the Inter nal Revenue\nService i n suits arising fro m their efforts to collect income ta xes. Req uests made in suits challenging th e\nadequacy of medic al care for incarcerated persons, however,  should be directed to the Federal Tort\nClaims Act Staff in the Torts Branch.\nIndividual  capacity repr esentation involves a  two-part test. First, the condu ct giving ris e to the\nclaim must have oc curred whi le the employee was  working withi n the scope of federal employm ent.\nSecond, it must be in the interest of the Uni ted States to assign a DOJ  attorney to provide a  defense for\nNOVEMBER 2010 UNITED STATES ATTORNEYS\u2019 BULLETIN 1\nthe employee. 2 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 50.15(a)(2) (2010); USAM  \u00a7 4-5.412( B). T he litigating divisi on reviews  the\ncomplai nt, the agency sta tement, and any suppor ting documenta tion to determine wh ether these two\nconditions are met. In the overwhel ming m ajority of cases, this review is  routine and the employee's\nrequest is approved a s a matter of course. However,  in difficult or novel cases, and in cases wher e initial\nreview su ggests the request should be denied, the matt er is sent to a higher of fice for a decision. In the\nCivil  Divis ion, these cases are forwa rded to the De puty Assis tant Attorney Gener al, who o verse es the\nTorts Branch. The De puty may, at her option, convene t he Ci vil Di visio n Rep resentation Co mmittee to\nprovide a dditional analysis a nd guid ance.\nIf individual  capacity repr esentation is approved, t he DOJ  attorney ass igned t o defend the\nemployee en ters into a \"full and traditional attorney cl ient relationship,\" and all communication between\nthe employee a nd the department attorney is  privileged. 28  C.F.R. \u00a7  50.1 5(a)(3) (2010). Acc ordingly,\ncare should be taken to ensure that privileged mater ial is clearly ide ntified and segregate d in the case file.\nAgency couns el employed by any DOJ  componen t are also bound  by the  privilege and  should take the\nsame pr ecautions. Id. \nCouns el employed by oth er agenci es, howe ver, ha ve the  option of being bound  by the  privilege.\nId. DOJ  attorneys r epresenting em ployees of  agenci es other than the DOJ  should ascertain early in the\nlitigatio n whe ther agency couns el agree  to be boun d by the  privilege and  must then carefully memoria lize\ncounsels\u2019 decision in the case file. If agency couns el opt out of the privilege, de partment a ttorneys sho uld\ntake car e to avoid  any comm unications with agency cou nsel that might wa ive the privilege.\nThe guid elines on individ ual capacity repr esentation include a number of terms and conditions.\nSee 28 C.F .R. \u00a7 5 0.15(a)(8)-(12)  (2010). These terms and conditions are set forth in the DOJ -399 form,\nwhic h can be obtained from the Con stitutional Torts Staff. DOJ  attorneys r epresenting curr ent or former\nfederal employees in their individ ual capacities should ensure that the client complet es this form and t hat\nit is made part of the case file.\nSome fed eral employees have pu rchased professional liability ins urance. To date, there are three\ncompani es selling thi s coverage:   Fed eral Employees De fense Services , Mass Bene fits Cons ultants, and\nWright USA (formerl y Wri ght & Com pany). Any fede ral employee who s erves as  a \"law enf orcement\nofficer,\" \"superviso r or managem ent official,\" or a \"temporary fire line manager\" is eligible for\nreimburse ment \"not to exceed one-half\" of the premium  paid for professional liability insu rance. 5\nU.S.C.A. Pt . III, Sub pt. D, Ch. 5 9, Su bch. IV. (Re fs & Annos ) (2010 ). DOJ  attorneys ar e eligible  for\nreimburse ment as well. FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT POLICIES & PROCEDURES BULLETIN, No. 0 5-17 (Apr.\n27, 2 005). The DOJ  counsel assigned to  represent federal employees i n their individual  capacities should\ninquire at the outset as to whet her the employee ca rries professional liability insu rance. If so, the carrier\nshould be promptly noti fied of the pending su it and kept i nformed as  the litigation progre sses.\nII. Types of personal liability claims sounding in tort against federal employees\nThree types of  personal liability claims sound ing in  tort are typical ly ass erted agai nst federal\nemployees i n their individual  capacity. Firs t, there are personal liability claims premised upon  an alleged\nviola tion of the Co nstitution. See, e.g., Bivens v. Six Unkn own Name d Age nts of the Fed. Bu reau of    \nNarc otics, 403  U.S. 38 8 (1971 ) (Four th Amendment). Second, there are personal liability claims        \npremised upon a viol ation of a federal statute. See, e.g., Brown v.  Nationsbank Co rp., 188 F.3d 579 (5th\nCir. 199 9) (Rackete er Influenced and Corrupt Organizati ons Act (RICO)) . Finally, th ere are personal\nliability claims premised upon  a viol ation of state tort law. See, e.g., United States v. Smi th, 499 U.S. 16 3\n(1991) (medic al malpractice). The most comm on defense strategies  for each type o f claim will  be\n2 UNITED STATES ATTORNEYS\u2019 BULLETIN NOVEMBER 2010\ncovere d below. For additional cover age of  this topic, refer to the U.S . ATTORNEYS' BULLETIN, No. 5 0,\nVol. 4 (July 200 2).\nIII. Common issues that arise when defending federal employees against personal\nliability constitutional tort claims\nA. Whether  a Bivens remedy shou ld be inferred at all\nIn Bivens v. Six Unkn own Name d Age nts of the Fed. Bu reau of Narc otics, 403  U.S. 38 8 (1971 ),\nthe Supr eme Court  allowe d the district courts to infer a personal liability remedy for  money dam ages\nagains t federal employees who  viola te the Fourth Am endment. Id. at 388. The Supreme Court  cautioned,\nhowever , that wher e there are \"special factors counsel[ing] h esitation,\" it may not be appropriate to infer\na Bivens remedy. Id. at 396. The Co urt later explained that a Bivens remedy doe s not lie in two situations: \n(1) wher e Con gress  has provided  an equally effective al ternative remedy and de clared it to be a substitute\nfor recovery und er the Con stitution; and (2) where, in the absence of affirmati ve act ion by Congress ,\nspecial factors counsel hesitation. Carlson v. Gr een, 446  U.S. 14  (1980).\nLater Supr eme Court  decisions show a  great  reticence to infer the Bivens remedy. I n 1983, the\nCour t declined to infer a Bivens remedy for  a federal employee se eking to l itigate  a constitutional claim\narising in  the context of his employment because the comprehensive remedia l scheme established by the\nCivil  Service Re form Act (CSRA)  constituted a special factor. Bush  v. Lucas, 462 U.S. 36 7 (1983 ). In\n1988 , the Cou rt declined to infer a Bivens remedy for  a plaintiff trying to litigate a  Fifth Amendment\nprocedural due process claim after being deni ed Social Security paym ents because the Social Security\nAct's review p rocess was a special factor. Schweiker v. Ch ilicky, 487 U.S. 41 2 (1988 ). In 2001, the Cour t\ndeclined to infer a Bivens remedy for  an inmate  seeking to a ssert an Eighth  Amendment claim again st a\nprivate p rison contractor because the inmate had an alternative remedy in t he form of a  respondeat\nsuperior negli gence c laim ag ainst the corporation. Corr ectional Services. Cor p. v. Malesko, 534 U.S. 61\n(2001). \nIn 30 years  of Bivens jurisprudence we ha ve ext ended its holding only twi ce, to provide\nan otherwise none xistent cause of action again st individual officers alleged to have ac ted\nunconstitutionally, or  to provide a  cause of action for a plaintiff who l acked any\nalternative reme dy for harms caused by an in divid ual officer's unconstitutional condu ct.\nWhere such circumstances are not present, we  have c onsistently rejected invita tions to\nextend Bivens . . . . \nId. at 70. \nIn 2007, the Co urt stressed that a Bivens remedy for  a claimed con stitutional viol ation \"has to\nrepresent a judgm ent about the best way to i mplement a constitutional guara ntee; it is not an a utomatic\nentitlement  no ma tter what  other mean s there may  be to vindicate a protected interest . . . .\" Wilkie v.\nRobb ins, 551 U.S. 53 7, 55 0 (2007 ) (emphasi s added).\nThe courts of appeals have been  similarly dis inclined to infer a Bivens remedy. I n Arar  v.\nAshc roft, 585 F.3d 559 (2d Cir. 200 9), the Second Circuit, sitting en banc, declined to infer a Bivens\nremedy for  an alien seeking to a ssert a constitutional tort claim again st the Attorney Gene ral and other\nhigh- ranking exec utive bra nch employees arising out  of his extraordinary extr adition from the  United\nStates to a foreign count ry. \nNOVEMBER 2010 UNITED STATES ATTORNEYS\u2019 BULLETIN 3\nIn Wilson v. Libby, 535 F.3d 697 (D.C. Ci r. 2008), the D.C. Ci rcuit considered a personal\nliability cons titutional tort claim brought b y a Cent ral Intel ligence Agenc y em ployee and  her husband\nagains t the V ice President and other senior adminis tration officials. These officials were alleged to have\nimprope rly disc losed the employee's covert  status in retaliation for her husband's protected First\nAmendment activity. T he D.C.  Circuit declined to infer a Bivens remedy bec ause the Privacy Act\nafforded plaintiffs an alternative remedy where  the challenged co nduc t involved wro ngful  dissemination\nof private i nformati on from g overnment r ecords. Id. at 704. \nIn Benz man v . Whitman, 523 F.3d 119 (2d Cir. 200 8), the Second Circuit decided a case in whi ch\nresidents of Manhattan sought t o assert a Fifth Amendment substantive due  process claim again st the\nhead of the Environ mental Protection Agency for  allegedly m isrepresenting the dangers p osed by\nairborne contaminants followin g the t errorist attack on S eptember 11 , 200 1. The Second Ci rcuit declined\nto infer a Bivens remedy bec ause plaintiffs had an alternative remedy in t he form of a  claim again st a\ngovernment fund set up to compensate those injured. Id. at 126. The Co urt explained that \"[a] Bivens\naction is a blunt and power ful instrument for correcting con stitutional viol ations and not an 'automati c\nentitlement' associated with every g overnmenta l infraction.\" Id. at 125.\nIn light o f this decisional authority, DOJ attorneys t hat defend federal employees agains t\npersonal liability, con stitutional tort claims should consider at the outset whet her it is proper for the\ndistrict court to infer the Bivens remedy. Wh ere the plaintiff has another way to l itigate  the propriety of\nthe challenged c ondu ct, a moti on to dismiss s hould be filed urging the d istrict court to eschew inferring a\nBivens remedy. T his type o f moti on wi ll be especially well -taken if  the plaintiff's claim is a nalogous t o\nthe claims at issue in Malesko, Wilkie, Ar ar, Wilson, or Benz man.  Moreover, a lthough t he decisional\nauthority is l ess clear, it is also possible to argue tha t district courts should decline to infer a Bivens\nremedy when the plaintiff can seek rel ief under the Ad ministrative Proc edures Act, the Freedom of\nInformati on Ac t, the Tucker Act, or the Immigration and Nationality Act. DOJ  attorneys en countering\nthese issues should contact the Con stitutional Torts Staff for guidan ce.\nB. Whether qualif ied im munity prote cts the em ployee from  suit on a Bivens claim\nIf the district court infers a Bivens remedy, th e defense of choice is qualified immunity. Alt hough\nsome dec isions still refer to \"good fa ith\" imm unity, th is reference is a misno mer. The qualified immunity\ndefense is who lly obj ective an d no inquiry int o a defendant's subjective good f aith is appropriate. See\nMitchell v. For syth, 472  U.S. 51 1, 51 7 (1985 ) (observing that  Harl ow \u201cpurged qu alified immunity\ndoctrine of its subjective co mpone nts\"); Davi s v. Scherer, 468  U.S. 18 3, 19 1 (1984 ) (observing that\nHarl ow \"rejected the inquiry int o state of mind in favor of  a who lly obj ective st andard\"). The qualified\nimmunity inq uiry rem ains wh olly obj ective even wh en the official's subjective intent is an essential part\nof plaintiff's affirmative ca se. See Crawf ord-El v. Britton, 523  U.S. 57 4, 58 8 (1998 ) (explaining that\nqualified immunity \"may  not be rebutted by eviden ce that the defendant's condu ct was malicious or\notherwise improperly motivated, \" because \"[e]videnc e concerning the d efendant's subjective intent is\nsimply ir relevant t o that defense.\").\n1. Quali fied im munity basics\nQual ified immunity shi elds government o fficials performing di scretionary funct ions from\nliability so l ong as t heir condu ct does not viol ate clearly est ablished statutory or c onstitutional rights, o f\nwhic h a reasonable person woul d have known. See Harl ow v.  Fitzgerald, 457  U.S. 80 0, 81 8 (1982 );\nAnde rson v. Creighton, 483  U.S. 63 5, 64 0 (1987 ). Even employees wh o viol ate the Co nstitution may\nnevert heless be protected from sui t by the d octrine of qualified immunity. See Wilson v. Layne, 526  U.S.\n4 UNITED STATES ATTORNEYS\u2019 BULLETIN NOVEMBER 2010\n603, 614, 618  (1999) (holding th at presence of media during exec ution of a warrant viola ted the Fourth\nAmendment, but grant ing qua lified immunity bec ause the right n ot clearly est ablished).\n2. The concept of \"clearly established l aw\"\nQual ified immunity giv es public officials the benefit of the doubt if the law at  the time of t heir\nconduct did not clearly pro hibit their actions. See Hunt er v. Br yant, 502  U.S. 22 4, 22 9 (1991 ) (per\ncuriam) (describing qual ified immunity as \"accommodation for reasonable error\"). Qual ified immunity\nprovides  \"ample room for mist aken j udgm ents\" and protects all government officials except \"the plainly\nincompetent or those who knowi ngly v iolate the law.\" Malley v. Br iggs, 475  U.S. 33 5, 34 1 (1986 ). Thus,\nofficials are immune from claims for damag es \"as long as t heir actions could reasonably have be en\nthought co nsistent with the rights  they are  alleged to have viol ated.\" Ande rson, 483  U.S. a t 638. \nThe inquiry is whet her reasonable officials, not judges o r constitutional scholars, could have\nthought t he defendant's condu ct permissible under the Con stitution. See Wilson, 526  U.S. a t 618. \" If the\nlaw did not put the officer on n otice that his conduct would be clearly unl awful, summ ary judgm ent\nbased on qualified immunity is appropriate.\" Sauc ier v. Kat z, 533  U.S. 19 4, 20 2 (2001 ).\nWhen gra ppling wit h wha t is \"clearly est ablished,\" the most critical step is properly defi ning the\nright at  issue. The inquiry must be \"fact-specific,\" Ande rson, 483  U.S. a t 641, a nd \"must be unde rtaken i n\nlight of  the specific context of the case, not as a broad gener al propos ition.\" Sauc ier, 533  U.S. a t 201. T o\noverco me qualified immunity, \"t he right t he official is alleged t o have violated must have be en 'clea rly\nestablished' in a more p articularized, a nd hence more r elevant,  sense:  The contours of the right must be\nsufficiently clear that a reasonable official woul d understand that what  he is doing violates that right.\"\nAnde rson, 483  U.S. a t 640. T his rule takes in to account one of the funda mental purposes of qualified\nimmunity, whic h is to bar liability when i t would be \"difficult for an officer to determine how t he\nrelevant l egal d octrine . . . wi ll apply to the factual situation the officer confronts.\" Sauc ier, 533  U.S. a t\n205.\nThe Supreme Court , therefore, has consistently begun it s qualified immunity ana lysis by def ining\nthe claimed right wi th relevant s pecificity. See, e.g., Bros seau v. Hauge n, 543  U.S. 19 4, 19 9, 20 0 (2004 )\n(per curiam) (de fining \"th e situation [the defendant] confronted\" as \"wh ether to shoot a disturbed felon,\nset on a voidi ng capt ure through vehicular flight, when persons in the immediate area are at risk from that\nflight\" ); Wilson, 526  U.S. a t 615 (defining the appropriate question as whet her a reasonable officer could\nhave be lieved t hat bringin g members of the media into a home during the execution of an arrest warrant\nwas lawful, in light of  clearly est ablished law and  the informati on the officers possessed.\"); Conn  v.\nGabbe rt, 526  U.S. 28 6, 29 1 (1999 ) (defining the relevant qu estion as whet her \"use of a search wa rrant by\ngovernment actors viol ates an attorney's right t o practice his profession\"). Thus, although pla intiffs will\noften attempt to  bypass  the second step of qualified immunity by asse rting so me hoary and overl y-genera l\nconstitutional precept, such as \"due process,\" \"free speech,\" or \"reasonableness,\" courts must l ook to\nwhet her, on the particular facts of the case, the right wa s clearly est ablished.\n3. What sort of authority m akes a right clear ly establish ed?\nOnce  the court has defined the specific right at  issue, the next step is to determine wh ether that\nright is  \"clearly est ablished.\" Ande rson, 483  U.S. a t 635-36. It is  too extreme to s ay tha t qualified\nimmunity appl ies unless the very act ion in question has previous ly bee n held unlawful. But, in light of\npre-existing la w, th e unlawfulness must b e apparent. Id. at 640. The \"salient question\" is whe ther the\nofficer had \"fair warning\" or  \"fair notice\" that his or her actions woul d viol ate the law. Hope v. Pe ltzer,\n536 U.S. 73 0, 73 9-41 (2002 ).\nNOVEMBER 2010 UNITED STATES ATTORNEYS\u2019 BULLETIN 5\nWhat constitutes fair warning varies from sit uation to situation. Hope , 536  U.S. a t 740-41. W here\nthe Cons titution itself is specific, the right may be cl early est ablished by the  plain text. See Groh  v.\nRami rez, 540  U.S. 55 1, 56 3 (2004 ) (holding no re asonable officer could believe tha t warrant that did not\nparticularly des cribe objects subject to seizure  could be val id given Fourth Amendment's textual\nrequirement of particularity). Mo st often, ho wever, t he Co nstitution's text is \"cast at a high le vel of\ngenera lity\" such that its application to particular facts will clearly est ablish a governing rule  only in\n\u201cobvious\"  cases. Bros seau, 543  U.S. a t 199.\nTherefore, review of  decisional authority inte rpreting th e constitutional provisi on at issue is\nusually nee ded. See, e.g., Sauc ier, 533  U.S. a t 209 (\"[N]either respondent nor the Cou rt of Appe als has\nidentified any case demonst rating a cl early est ablished rule prohibiting th e officer from acting as he\ndid[.]\") (emphasis added). The decisions need not be \"fundamenta lly\" or \"mater ially sim ilar\" on the facts,\nespecially when egregiou s viol ations are at issue and \u201cofficials can still be on notice that their condu ct\nviola tes established law even i n novel factual circumstances.\" Hope , 536  U.S. a t 741. \nIt is not necessary for  the Supreme Cou rt to have c onsidered the issue being li tigated.  Deci sions\nfrom the courts of appeals can clearly est ablish a constitutional rule. Hope , 536  U.S. a t 741-43\n(examinin g Elevent h Circuit precedent). However , when  the issue is \"one in which the result depends\nvery m uch on the facts of each case,\" an officer cannot have f air notice unless the cases \"squarely\ngovern.\" Bros seau, 543  U.S. a t 201; see also Conn , 526  U.S. a t 291 (holding that  law was not clearly\nestablished wher e cases all dealt with a complet e prohibition of the right t o engage in a certain calling,\nnot the brief interruption that affected plaintiff).\nThe Supreme Court  has identified at least two situations in which caselaw is unlikely to  have \nclearly est ablished a constitutional rule. First, a circuit split on a n issue indicates that the law is not\nclearly est ablished. See Wilson, 526  U.S. a t 618 (\"If judges t hus disagre e on a constitutional question, it\nis unfair to subject police to money dam ages f or picking the l osing sid e of the controver sy.\")  Second,\n\"when an earlier case expressly leaves open whe ther a gener al rule applies to the particular type o f\nconduct at issue,\" the law on  that conduct will not be clearly est ablished unless a later case addresses the\nquestion with \"a very hi gh degree of prior factual particularity . . . .\"  Hope , 536  U.S. a t 741 (quoting\nUnited States v. La nier, 520  U.S. 25 9, 27 0-71 (1997 )).\nAn of ficial remains immune even i f his conduct viol ated other, non-constitutional standards such\nas internal guidel ines, ethical principles, or regulat ions. See Davi s v. Scherer, 468  U.S. 18 3, 19 4-96\n(1984). For  example, in Magluta v. Sampl es, 375 F.3d 1269  (11th Cir. 200 4) (Magluta III) a pretrial\ndetainee brought a  Fifth Amendment, procedural due process claim again st prison managers  after they\ntransferred him to ad ministrative det ention and failed to provide t he periodic review m andated by a\nBure au of Prisons regulat ion. The Eleventh Ci rcuit rejected the detainee's argum ent that viola ting the\nregulat ion was the same as viol ating th e Con stitution. Id. at 1279. The court of appeals held the rule of\ndecision was properly drawn from controlling dec isional authority inte rpreting th e constitutional\nprovisio n at issue rather than the Cod e of Federal Regula tions. Id.\nWhile agency poli cy does  not by it self control the immunity ana lysis, courts sometimes ex amine\nit to see if the law is clearly est ablished. See, e.g., Groh  v. Ra mirez, 540  U.S. 55 1, 56 4 (2004 ). A policy\nproscribing the challenged c ondu ct certainly und ermines any argum ent that the employee was  unaware\nthe conduct was unlawful. See id. On t he other hand, a policy expr essly allowing or r equiring ce rtain\nconduct may  support an officer\u2019s contention that he reasonably bel ieved his  conduct to be constitutional.\nSee Wilson v. La yne, 526  U.S. 60 3, 61 7 (1999 ). It is  import ant to note, however,  that the agency poli cy\nmust be read agains t the decisional authority. See Hope v. Pe ltzer, 536  U.S. 73 0, 74 4 (2002 ) (opining that\n6 UNITED STATES ATTORNEYS\u2019 BULLETIN NOVEMBER 2010\nregulat ion appeared to be sham in light of  mandates in caselaw); Wilson, 526  U.S. a t 617-18 (holding that\nofficers could rely on pol icy only wher e caselaw \"wa s at best undevelop ed\").\n4. Quali fied im munity is m ore t han a d efense to liabil ity\nQual ified immunity pro tects not only again st liability but  also from tri al and even f rom\ndiscovery. Siegert v. Gilley, 500  U.S. 22 6, 23 2 (1991 ) (explaining that  qualified immunity pro tects\nofficials from \"expensive and t ime cons uming pr eparation to defend the suit on its merits\" and from \"not\nonly unwarr anted liability, but u nwar ranted demands customarily imposed upon those defending a l ong\ndrawn out  lawsui t\"). Litigation diverts energy and resources from pressing pub lic problems, the  threat of\npersonal liability dis courages ca pable people from assuming publ ic positions, and the fear of suit may\ndeter officials from exer cising judgm ent with the decisiveness  critical to their offices. See Harl ow v.\nFitzgerald, 457  U.S. 80 0, 81 4 (1982 ). Be cause litigatio n imposes these costs whet her or not liability is\nimposed , qua lified immunity \"is an immun ity from s uit rather than a mere defense to liability.\" Mitchell v.\nFors yth, 472  U.S. 51 1, 52 6 (1985 ). Also, because these costs begin to  accrue as soon as a case has been\nfiled, the Supreme Court  \"repeatedly ha[s ] stressed the importance of resolving im munity ques tions at the\nearliest possible stage in  litigatio n.\" Hunt er v. Br yant, 502  U.S. 22 4, 22 7 (1991 ); see also Sauc ier v. Ka tz,\n533 U.S. 19 4, 20 0 (2001 ) (\"Where the defendant seeks qua lified immunity, a r uling on th at issue should\nbe made e arly in the proceedings so t hat the costs and expenses of trial are avoide d whe re the defense is\ndispositive.\" ) If a de fendant raises qualified immunity in a motio n to dismiss o r a prediscovery m otion\nfor summ ary judgm ent, then \"[u]ntil this threshold immunity ques tion is resolved, d iscovery sho uld not\nbe allowed. \" Harl ow, 457  U.S. a t 818; see also Crawf ord-El v. Britton, 523  U.S. 57 4, 59 8 (1988 )\n(explaining that  \"if the defendant does plead the immunity def ense, the district court should resolve that\nthreshold question before permitting dis covery\") .\n5. The anal ytical fram ework f or qualif ied im munity\nAs no ted above, th e qualified immunity test contains two steps. For  many years , the Supreme\nCour t mandat ed that the \"initial inquiry\" must b e whe ther the officer's condu ct viola ted a constitutional\nright. Sauc ier, 533 U.S. at  201. If no constitutional right wa s viol ated, then \"there is no n ecessity for\nfurther inquiries concerning quali fied immunity.\" Id. But, \"if a viol ation could be made o ut on a\nfavorabl e view o f the parties' subm issions,\" then \u201cthe next, sequential step is to ask whethe r the right wa s\nclearly est ablished.\" Id. \nDuring the 1990 s, the Supreme Court  warned again st skipp ing ahe ad to the second step and\ninsisted lower  courts begin wit h the initial inquiry int o whe ther the challenged co nduc t was\nconstitutional. Siegert v. Gilley, 500  U.S. 22 6, 23 2 (1991 ) (criticizing th e court of appeals for assuming,\nwithout deciding, the  \"preliminary issue\" of whether the plaintiff had alleged a c onstitutional viola tion);\nsee also Co unty of Sacrame nto v. Lewis, 523  U.S. 83 3, 84 1 (1998 ) (explaining that  \u201c[t]he first step is to\nidentify the  exact contours of the underlying ri ght sa id to have be en viol ated\u201d). The Co urt explained that\naddressing the steps in order advanc ed \"the law's elaboration from case to case\" by ensu ring cour ts will\n\"set forth principles whic h will become the basis for a holding that  the right i s clearly est ablished.\"\nSauc ier v. Kat z, 533  U.S. 19 4, 20 1 (2001 ). Otherwise, the Co urt reasoned, \"standards of official condu ct\nwoul d tend to remain uncertain, to the detriment b oth of officials and individual s.\" Lewi s, 523  U.S. a t\n842.\nIn recent years , howe ver, t he Co urt expressed increasing skept icism over r igid a pplication of the\nSauc ier test. In fact, in some ca ses the Cou rt failed to follow its own i nstruction altogethe r. See, e.g.,\nBros seau v. Hau gen, 543  U.S. 19 4, 19 8 (2004 ) (expressing \"no view\" on the constitutional question itself\nNOVEMBER 2010 UNITED STATES ATTORNEYS\u2019 BULLETIN 7\nand instead concluding that  \"however that question is decided, the Cou rt of Appe als was wrong on t he\nissue of qualified immunity\"); Sauc ier, 533  U.S. a t 207-08 (assuming viola tion could have occu rred on\nfacts alleged an d proceeding dir ectly to assessment of clearly est ablished law).\nBy 2008, a t least four sitting J ustices had signaled  support for a more f lexible approach. See\nMorse v. Frederick, 551  U.S. 39 3, 43 2 (2007 ) (Breyer, J ., dissenting) (\" alwa ys requiring lower  courts\nfirst to answer  constitutional questions is misguided  . . .

See, e.g., Egol f v. Witmer, 526  F.3d  104, 109 -10 (3d Ci r. 2008) (\"We find in this case an\nexception to [Sauc ier's] gene rally mandated analytic framework.\") ; see also id. at 112 (Smith , J.,\nconcurring) (i dentifying cas es wher e other circuits expressed doubts about or declined to follow\nSauc ier); Clement  v.

Ca llahan , 128 S. Ct . 170 2\n(2008) with specific instructions that clearly signaled  its intention to revisi t the analytica l framewor k. In\naddition to the questions presented by the  petition, the parties were directed to brief and argue whe ther\nSauc ier should be overr uled.\nOn J anuary 23, 200 9, the Pear son Cour t held that Sauc ier should be overr uled. Pear son v.\nCallahan , 129 S. Ct . 808  (2009). Writing for  a unanimous Cou rt, Justice Alito began the  opinion by\nrecognizin g that  the two-step analysis mandat ed by Siegert and Sauc ier \"is often beneficial\" to help\ndevelo p constitutional law. Id. at 818. He n oted, ho wever, t hat requiring a th reshold determination\nregardi ng the constitutionality of the challenged c ondu ct comes a t a price. It may  require \"substantial\nexpenditure of scarce judicial resources on difficult questions that have no  effect on the outcome of the\n8 UNITED STATES ATTORNEYS\u2019 BULLETIN NOVEMBER 2010\ncase.\" Id. Cons titutional tort defendants are also adverse ly affected wh en they ar e required to litigate  a\nconstitutional question in an area wher e the law is obviousl y not c learly est ablished. Id. \nJustice Alito also reasoned that mandating th e first step in the qualified immunity ana lysis did\nlittle to devel op the jurisprudence. Id. at 819. Some is sues were so fact-boun d that a decision provid ed\nlittle guidan ce in future cases. Id. Others required lower  courts to decide an issue pending in a  higher\ncourt with the possibility of conflicting hold ings. Id. Moreover, i n those cases whe re qualified immunity\nis decided in a ruling on a  motion to dismiss, resolving the c onstitutional issue is difficult in the absence\nof a fully-develo ped factual record. Id. at 819-20. T his problem som etimes l eads to \"woef ully\ninadequate\" advoca cy by the p arties and the risk that  a court \"may not devote  as much care as it woul d in\nother circumstances to the decision of the constitutional issue.\" Id. at 820.\nPear son also notes that mandating bot h steps of the qualified immunity ana lysis someti mes\ncreates problems at the circuit for defendants who  prevail  in district court.\nWhere a court holds that a defendant comm itted a constitutional viol ation but that the viol ation\nwas not clearly est ablished, the defendant may fac e a difficult situation. As  the winning part y,\nthe defendant's right t o appeal the adverse  holding on the  constitutional question may  be\ncontested.\nId. at 820. \nFinally, adh erence to Sauc ier's two step protocol departs from the  gener al rule of constitutional\navoida nce and runs counter to the gener al rule again st passing on que stions of constitutionality unl ess\nsuch adjudication is unavoidab le. Id.\nOn reconsidering th e procedure required in Sauc ier, we c onclude that, whi le the\nsequence set forth there is often appropriate, it should no longer be  regarded  as\nmandatory. T he judges o f the district courts and the courts of appeals should be\npermitted to exercise their sound discretion in deciding which  of the two pr ongs of  the\nqualified immunity ana lysis should be addressed first in light of  the circumstan ces in the\nparticular case at hand.\nId. at 818.\nIn our view, Pear son is a positive develop ment for department attorneys de fending fede ral\nemployees i n their individual  capacities agains t personal liability, con stitutional tort (Bivens) claims.\nNoth ing in  the decision prevents  the traditional \"belt and suspenders\" argument that the challenged\nconduct did not viola te the constitution, and even i f it did, the law was  not clearly est ablished. In cases\npresenting a cl ose question, howe ver, de partment a ttorneys wil l be able to bypass  Sauc ier's thicket an d\nargue ent itlement to qualified immunity on t he grou nd that the law is not clearly est ablished.\n6. Quali fied im munity and the elusive \"extraordinary circ umstances\"\nIn Harl ow v.  Fitzgerald, 457  U.S. 80 0, 81 8 (1982 ), the Supreme Court  suggeste d that even i f the\nchallenged c ondu ct viola ted a constitutional right, and even i f that right was  clearly est ablished, qua lified\nimmunity might s till bar suit \"if the official pleading th e defense claims extraordinary circumstan ces and\ncan prove tha t he neither knew nor  should have known of  the relevant legal st andard.\" Id. at 819. The\nSupr eme Court  has never  explained precisely what c ircumstan ces are \"extraordinary\" e nough t o war rant\nqualified immunity, and  the courts of appeals have not often gra ppled wi th this question. Nevert heless,\nthe decisions show t hat some ci rcumstances might b e extraordinary enough to  warrant qualified\nimmunity.\nNOVEMBER 2010 UNITED STATES ATTORNEYS\u2019 BULLETIN 9\nSevera l circuits agree , for instance, that an officer acting on th e advice of counsel may  be able to\ndemonst rate that extraordinary circumstances prevented  her from recognizin g clea rly esta blished law.\nSee, e.g., Lawre nce v. Reed, 406  F.3d  1224, 12 30-31 (10th Cir. 2005); Davi s v. Zirkelbach, 149  F.3d  614,\n620-21 (7t h Cir. 1998); Buon ocore v. Har ris, 134  F.3d  245, 252 -53 (4th Cir. 199 8). Cf. Silberstein v. City\nof Dayt on, 440  F.3d  306, 318  (6th Cir. 200 6) (recognizing pote ntial for advice of counsel to create\nextraordinary circumstances, but noting Si xth Circuit has never grant ed qualified immunity on t hat\nground) . Oth er decisions seem to go th e other way, hol ding that  reliance on advic e of counsel \"is not\ninherently ext raordinary, for  few things i n gov ernment are more c ommon than the receipt of legal\nadvice .\" V-1 Oil Co. v . State of Wyo., Dep' t of Envtl. Qu ality, 902  F.2d  1482, 14 88 (10th Cir. 1990). The\ncourt in that case explained that determining wheth er advic e of counsel is an extraordinary circumstan ce\nmay depe nd on the followin g fact ors:  (1) how un equivocal  and specifically tailored the advice was to the\nparticular facts giving ri se to the controversy; ( 2) whet her complet e informati on had been provided  to the\nadvis ing at torney(s) ; (3) the prominence and compete nce of the attorney(s) ; and (4) how s oon after the\nadvice  was received the  disputed action wa s taken. Id. at 1489 (internal citations omitt ed); accord Davi s\nv. Zirkelbach, 149  F.3d  at 620.\nAside from advice  of counsel, there is little consensus on wha t circumstan ces might r ise to the\nlevel of  \"extraordinary.\" Some cour ts have s uggested that circumstances might b e extraordinary when an\nofficer relies on a state or local statute. See Rosk a ex rel. Roska v. Sneddon , 437  F.3d  964, 971  (10th Cir.\n2006 ); Mimics, Inc. v. Vill. of Ange l Fire, 394  F.3d  836, 846  (10th Cir. 200 5). Other decisions consider\nreliance on the advice of superior officer, see, e.g., Liu v. Phillips, 234  F.3d  55, 58 (1st Cir. 200 0); on a cts\ndirectly at the behest of a judge, see Lowe v. Le tsinger, 772  F.2d  308, 314  (7th Cir. 198 5); on b udgeta ry\nconstraints precluding a ce rtain course of action, McCord  v. M aggio, 927  F.2d  844, 848  (5th Cir. 199 1);\nor an emergency prec luding fu rther factual investi gatio n, Rykers v. Alford, 832  F.2d  895, 899  (5th Cir.\n1987 ).\n7. Quali fied im munity and the bu rden of p leading an d persuasion\nQual ified immunity is an affirmati ve def ense that must be pled. Crawf ord-El v. Britton, 523  U.S.\n574, 586 (1988); Harl ow v.  Fitzgerald, 457  U.S. 80 0, 81 5 (1982 ); Gomez  v. Toledo, 446  U.S. 63 5, 64 0\n(1980). The Supreme Court , howe ver, ha s never ex plained whi ch party must prove what , onc e the defense\nhas been asserted. See Gomez , 446  U.S. a t 642 (noting th at Justice Rehnqu ist joined the Co urt\u2019s opinion\nbased on his understanding th at the opinion \u201cle[ft] open the issue of the burden of persuasion, a s opposed\nto the burden of pleading\u201d) . \nOf course, to the extent that qualified immunity is properly raised and the facts are undisputed (as\nin a motio n to dismiss) , the defense presents a question of law to whi ch burden allocation is, in a sense,\nirrelevant. See Elder v. Hol lowa y, 510  U.S. 51 0, 51 5-16 (1994 ). The leading dec ision in respect of what\nconstitutes a well-pleaded Bivens claim is Ashc roft v. Iqbal, 129  S. Ct . 193 7 (2009 ). DOJ  attorneys\nconsidering a moti on to dismiss u nder Fed. R. Ci v. P. 12( b)(6) should also consult Bell Atlantic Cor p. v.\nTwombl y, 550  U.S. 54 4 (2007 ) (abrogati ng Conl ey v. Gi bson rule for when a complai nt states a claim).\nFinally, we no te the courts of appeals have develop ed wi dely divergent (and sometimes el aborate)\napproaches to allocating th e burden of demonst rating various aspects of the qualified immunity inq uiry.\nCons traints of space preclude a circuit-by-circuit analysis.

Defending federal employees against personal liability tort claims premised upon\nan alleged violation of federal statutory law\nOcca sionally, depar tment l awyers  will encounter a claim that  seeks to  recover money dam ages\nfrom an employee\u2019s  personal assets, premised upon an allegati on the employee viola ted a federal statute. \nThe first inquiry is whet her the statute in question provides  a private r ight o f action. This is\ncontrolled by a fou r-part test:  (1) whet her the statute was  enacted for the benefit of the plaintiff; (2)\nindication of legisla tive int ent to create a private  remedy; ( 3) consistency with t he purposes of the\nlegisla tive sche me; and (4) whether the cause of action wou ld traditionally com e under state law. Cort v.\nAsh, 422 U.S. 66 , 78 (1975). The central inquiry is whet her Congres s intended to create, either expressly\nor by im plication, a private c ause of action. Touc he Ross & Co. v . Red ington, 442 U.S. 56 0, 57 5 (1979 ).\nSee also Go nzaga Uni v. v. Doe , 536  U.S. 27 3, 28 6 (2002 ) (focusing on co ngress ional intent as eviden ced\nby sta tutory te xt); Alexander v.

See, e.g., Martinez v. Bur eau of Prisons,\n444 F.3d 620 (D.C.

Gilmore , 998 F.Sup p. 66 6, 66 8 (E.D. V a. 1998) (Privacy Act allows  a private c ause of action\nagains t a federal agency, not  individ uals).\nThere are, howe ver, so me statutes that create a private  right of  action whi ch may be as serted\nagains t a federal employee i n his individual  capacity. See, e.g., Bridge v. Phoenix Bond  & Indem. Co ., 128\nS.

Ca l. 2006) (permitting sui t agains t individual  for alleged viol ation of the Electronic\nCom munications Privacy Act) . \nIf no private  right of  action exists for the statute upon whi ch the plaintiff relies, it should be a\nsimple matter to seek dis missal of the personal liability fede ral statutory cl aim under FED. R. CIV. P.\n12(b)(6). If, however,  the statute in question is one wher e the courts have f ound  a private r ight o f action,\nthen the defense of choice is qualified immunity. \nThe Supreme Court  has long rec ognized t hat qualified immunity is avail able to counter not only\nconstitutional claims but  also statutory cl aims. See Harl ow, 457 U.S. 80 0, 81 8 (\"We therefore hold that\ngovernment officials performing dis cretionary funct ions gener ally are shielded from li ability for  civil\ndamag es insofar as their condu ct does not viol ate clearly est ablished statutory or constitutional rights  of\nwhic h a reasonable person woul d have known.\" ) (emphasi s added). The courts of appeals are in accord.\nSee, e.g., Tapl ey v. Co llins, 211 F.3d 1210 , 121 4-15 (11th Cir. 2000) (holding qua lified immunity is\navail able agains t statutory cl aim unless Congres s intended to abrogat e the defense of qualified immunity\nNOVEMBER 2010 UNITED STATES ATTORNEYS\u2019 BULLETIN 11\nto claims under that act); Berry v.

Defending federal employees against personal liability tort claims premised upon\nan alleged violation of state law\nThe gene ral rule is that federal employees enjoy abso lute immunity from tort claims that\nchallenge ne gligent or wron gful a cts performed whi le acting with in the scope of government employm ent.\nSee Osbo rn v. Hal ey, 549 U.S. 22 5, 22 9-30 (2007 ). The source of this absolute immunity is the Federal\nEmployees Li ability Refo rm and T ort Com pensation Act of 1988, commonly known a s the W estfall Act.\n28 U.S. C. \u00a7 2 679 (2010).\nUnder  the Westfall Act, the exclusive remedy for anyone injured by the  negli gent or  wrongful  act\nof a federal employee ac ting in t he scope of employm ent is a suit again st the Uni ted States unde r the\nFede ral Tort Claims Act.  28 U.S .C. \u00a7 2 679(b)(1) (2010). Des pite this clear statutory comm and,\ndepartment a ttorneys of ten encounter plaintiffs who s eek to  recover money dam ages f rom the  personal\nassets of federal employees for an alleged viola tion of state tort law. For tunately, thi s pleading m istake is\neasily rem edied. The W estfall Act permits the At torney Gene ral to certify that  the employee \"wa s acting\nwithin the scope of his office or employm ent at the time of t he incident out of whic h the claim aros e.\" 28\nU.S.C. \u00a7 2679 (d)(1) (2010). If the case is pending in st ate court, the certification permits the case to be\nremoved an y time pri or to trial. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2679(d)(2) (2010). The certification also causes the employee\nto be dismissed from the action and the Uni ted States substituted in his place as the only def endant on the\nstate law tort claim. Id. From that point the case proceeds like an y other  claim under the Federal Tort\nClaims Act and all the usual FTCA def enses apply. 28 U.S .C. \u00a7 2 679(d)(4) (2010).\nOf course, the FT CA is  a limite d wai ver of  sover eign im munity and expressly excl udes certain\nclaims. See, e.g., 28 U.S. C. \u00a7 2 680(a) (2010) (claims cha llenging di scretionary deci sions); 28 U.S .C.\n\u00a7 2680(h) (2010) (intentional torts). Moreover, a s noted elsewh ere in this issue, compliance with the\nFTCA's statute of limitations is a jurisdictional prerequisite. See 28 U.S. C. \u00a7\u00a7 1346 (b), 240 1(b) (2010 ).\nAcco rdingly, in s ome cases followin g the s ubstitution of the Uni ted States as sole party defe ndant unde r\nthe Westfall Act, it is clear the plaintiff is not entitled to relief. Some plaintiffs respond by arguin g that  the\nsubstitution wa s improper, apparently pre ferring to  sue the employee in divid ually ins tead of pursuing a\nclaim again st the Uni ted States that is doomed to fail. Us ually thi s argum ent is couched in terms of a\nchallenge t o the certification of scope of employm ent.\nThe Supreme Court  held in Gutierrez de M artinez v. Lamag no, 515  U.S. 41 7 (1995 ), that the\nAttorney Gener al\u2019s certifications under the Act  are judicially reviewabl e. See id. at 434.

Introduction\nWhen a tort plaintiff seeking to s ue the Un ited States under the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA),\n28 U.S. C. \u00a7\u00a7 1346 (b), 267 1-2680  (2010), fails to submit an adminis trative cl aim to the appropriate agency\nwithin 2 year s of the accrual of her cause of action or fails to file suit within 6 months  of an agency den ial\nof the admini strative cla im, she wi ll likely argue t hat the statute of limitations should be \u201ctolled\u201d for\nequitable reasons. Fed eral courts, however,  are increasingly fi nding that  this argument is not avail able to\nNOVEMBER 2010 UNITED STATES ATTORNEYS\u2019 BULLETIN 13\nFTCA pl aintiffs because the FTCA\u2019s  statute of limitations is jurisdictional and, as such, is not subject to\ntolling, waiver,  or estoppel. These courts have r elied on the reasoning of t he Supreme Court 's decision in\nJohn R. S and & Grav el Co. v . Uni ted States, 552  U.S. 13 0 (2008 ), wh ich held that the statute of\nlimitations for claims agains t the government i n the Un ited States Cou rt of Federal Claims was\njurisdictional and could not be waived. T his article will examine whet her the FT CA's statute of\nlimitations, like the statute of limitations for court of claims actions, is jurisdictional. The article will\nconsider recent caselaw add ressing thi s issue, including a spl it in the circuit courts of appeals.\nAddi tionally, the a rticle will explain why, ir respective of  the jurisdictional nature of the FT CA\u2019s  statute of\nlimitations, it is important to show that Congres s did not intend for equitable tolling to  apply to the statute.\nThe article concludes with sugg estions for federal government attorneys who  argue tha t equitable tolling\nshould not apply to the FTCA's statute of limitations. \nII. The FTCA's statute of limitations and caselaw before John R. Sand & Gravel\nAs on e court stated, the FTCA\u2019s  statute of limitations \u201crepresents a deliberate balance struck by\nCongres s whe reby a li mited wa iver of sovere ign imm unity is conditioned upon the prompt presentation of\ntort claims agains t the government.\u201d  Goul d v. U.S. De p't of Heal th and Human S ervices, 905  F.2d  738,\n742 (4th Cir. 1990) (en banc). The statute imposes two filing dead lines on c laimants :\nA tort claim again st the Uni ted States shall be forever b arred unless it is presented in\nwriting to t he appropriate federal agency wit hin two years  after such claim accrues or\nunless action is begun wit hin six months  after the date of mailing, by cert ified or\nregiste red mail, of notice of final denial of the claim by  the agency to whi ch it was\npresented.\n28 U.S. C. \u00a7 2 401(b) (2010). Thus, a plaintiff must f ile an administrative cla im with the appropriate federal\nagency wit hin 2 year s of the time the  claim accrues and begin a n action wi thin 6 month s of the maili ng of\nthe notice of final denial of the claim. Id. If a plaintiff fails to meet e ither deadline, the claim \u201cshall be\nforever b arred.\u201d Id. Als o, if the agency does  not take act ion on a  claim within 6 months  of the time the\nclaim is presented, the claimant c an deem the  claim denied. 28  U.S.C. \u00a7  2675(a) (2010 ).  \nThe Supreme Court  has never  explicitly rule d that the FT CA\u2019s  statute of limitations is\njurisdictional and therefore not subject to tolling, wai ver, or  estoppel. However , the only Supr eme Court\ncase interpreting th e FT CA's statute of limitations contains language th at woul d lead to this conclusion. In\nUnited States v. Ku brick, 444  U.S. 11 1, 11 9-22 (1979 ), the Co urt held that the accrual of a cause of action\nunde r the FTCA's statute of limitations was not delayed un til a plaintiff had reason to believe th at the\nUnited States was negligent.  In reaching this  conclusion, the Co urt stated, \u201c[T]he [FTCA] wa ives t he\nimmunity of the United States and . . . in construing the statute of limitations, wh ich is a condition of that\nwaiver, we should not take it upon ourselves to  extend the wai ver be yond th at which Co ngress  intended.\u201d \nId. at 117-18. By virt ue of Article III of the Uni ted States Cons titution, compliance with a condition on the\nwaiver of  the Uni ted States\u2019 sover eign im munity is a prerequisite to a federal court\u2019s exercise of\njurisdiction. See Block v. N.D. ex rel. Bd. of Univ . and  Sch. Lan ds, 461  U.S. 27 3, 28 7 (1983 ) [hereinafter\nBlock]; United States v. Sherwood , 312  U.S. 58 4, 58 6 (1941 ).\nHowever, even af ter the Supreme Court \u2019s decision in Kubr ick, federal courts reached different\nconclusions on wh ether the FT CA\u2019s  statute of limitations was jurisdictional. The issue sometimes ar ose in\nthe context of whet her the Uni ted States had to plead the statute as an affirmati ve def ense and\nconsequently had t o carry the b urden of provin g non- complia nce; other times, i t arose in the context of\nwhet her the statute of limitations was subject to equitable tolling. See e.g., Hughe s v. Uni ted States, 263\nF.3d 272, 278 (3d Cir. 2001) (not jurisdictional); Johnson v. Smithsonian Inst., 189  F.3d  180, 189  (2d Cir.\n14 UNITED STATES ATTORNEYS\u2019 BULLETIN NOVEMBER 2010\n1999 ) (jurisdictional); Perez v. Uni ted States, 167  F.3d  913, 915 -17 (5th Cir. 199 9) (not jurisdictional);\nCosk a v. United States, 114 F. 3d 319, 3 22 (1st Cir. 199 7) (jurisdictional); Glar ner v. U.S . Dep' t of\nVeterans Admin ., 30 F.3d 697, 701 (6th Cir. 199 4) (not jurisdictional). Ironi cally, a de cision whi ch led\nmany cou rts to find that the FT CA\u2019s  statute of limitations was not jurisdictional, and therefore could be\ntolled, did not specifically addr ess the FT CA or whet her a limita tions period in a wa iver-of- immunity\nstatute was jurisdictional. In Irwin v. De p\u2019t of Veterans Affairs, 498  U.S. 89 , 93-96 (19 90), the Supreme\nCour t found  that the 30-day li mitations period in Title VII of the Civil Ri ghts Ac t of 1964 could be\nequitably toll ed. In so doing, the  Cour t adopted a gener ally appl icable \u201cpresumpti on\u201d to replace its prior\nad hoc determinations regardi ng when a  statute of limitations for actions agains t the Un ited States was\nsubject to equitable tolling. Id. at 95-96. T he Co urt stated \u201cthat the same reb uttable presumption of\nequitable tolling app licable to suits again st private  defendants should also apply to su its agains t the Un ited\nStates. Co ngress , of course may  provide o therwise if it wishes to do s o.\u201d Id. \nSubs equently, m any cou rts reflexivel y held that Irwin compell ed the conclusion that the FTCA\u2019s\nstatute of limitations could be equitably toll ed and wa s therefore not jurisdictional. The leading ca se for\nthis propos ition was Schmidt v. Un ited States, 933  F.2d  639 (8th Cir. 199 1). In Schmidt, the Eighth Ci rcuit\nreverse d an earlier ruling in t he same cas e that the FTCA\u2019s  6-month limita tions period for filing su it was\njurisdictional and that the plaintiff carried the burden of provin g com pliance. Id. at 639-40. T he Supreme\nCour t had remanded t he earlier ruling for  reconsideration in light of  Irwin. See Schmidt v. Un ited States,\n901 F.3d 680 (8th Cir. 1990), cert. granted and judgme nt vacated, 498  U.S. 10 77 (1991 ). On  remand, the\nEighth  Circuit found  that the \u201cimplic it holding\u201d of Irwin was that \u201cstrict compliance with the statute of\nlimitations is not a jurisdictional prerequisite to suing th e government.\u201d  Schmidt, 933  F.2d  at 640.\nTherefore, the FT CA's 6-m onth limita tions period could be equitably to lled, and was not jurisdictional. Id.\nBase d on this conclusion, the court found  that the Uni ted States had the burden of pleading and  proving\nthe FTCA's limita tions bar. Id.   \nWhat Schmidt and many of the cases followin g Schmidt failed to recognize was t hat Irwin had\nmerely held that Title VII's statute of limitations for claims agains t the government wa s subject to\nequitable tolling. T he Irwin Cour t did not conclude that the provisi on wa s not jurisdictional. Doi ng so\nwoul d have been  contrary to a l ong-standing pr inciple that the Cou rt reaffirmed th e same y ear it decided\nIrwin:  namely, that  a limita tions period in a wa iver-of- immunity statute is a jurisdictional prerequisite to\nsuit if it is a condition of the Uni ted States\u2019 consent to suit. See United States v. Dal m, 494  U.S. 59 6, 60 8-\n10 (1990 ). Indeed,  Title VII, the statute at issue in Irwin, is a wa iver of sovere ign imm unity in its\napplication to the Uni ted States, and the limita tions period is a condition of that waiver. Irwin, 498  U.S. a t\n93-94. On e could argue tha t Irwin established that limitations periods in waiver-of-im munity statutes can\nbe both jurisdictional and subject to equitable tolling. \nIn T.L. e x rel. Ingram v. Un ited States, 443  F.3d  956, 959 -61 (8th Cir. 200 6), the Eighth Ci rcuit,\nwhic h in Schmidt had reasoned that the FT CA\u2019s  statute of limitations was not jurisdictional because it was\nsubject to equitable tolling, de cided, upo n further reflection and devel opment i n the caselaw, th at the\nFTCA\u2019s  statute of limitations could be both jurisdictional and subject to equitable tolling. T he court\nreasoned that wher e Con gress  intended equitable tolling to  apply, \u201ct here is no inconsistency betwe en\nviewin g com pliance with the statute of limitations as a jurisdictional prerequisite and applying the r ule of\nequitable tolling.\u201d Id. at 961. The court concluded that \u201cconsiderations of equitable tolling si mply m ake\nup part of the . . . determination [as to] whet her an action falls within the scope of the wai ver of  sover eign\nimmunity grant ed by Cong ress, and thus wi thin the jurisdiction of the federal courts.\u201d Id. The Supreme\nCour t has also recognized th at courts, not Congres s, lack th e authority to provide f or equitable exceptions\nto statutes of limitations. See Bowl es v. Ru ssell, 551  U.S. 20 5, 21 4 (2007 ) (\u201c[T]his Cou rt has no a uthority\nto create equitable exceptions to jurisdictional requirements . . . .\u201d) (emphasi s added). \nNOVEMBER 2010 UNITED STATES ATTORNEYS\u2019 BULLETIN 15\nNevert heless, whet her a statute of limitations is jurisdictional is still an important consideration in\ndetermining congres sional intent. In Holland v. Florida, 130  S.Ct . 254 9 (2010 ), the Supreme Court\nimplie d that Irwin's rebuttable presumption in favor of  equitable tolling was  confined to non-jurisdictional\nstatutes, stating \u201c[w] e have pre viousl y made clear that a nonjurisdictional federal statute of limitations is\nnormally sub ject to a \u2018rebuttable presumption\u2019 in favor of \u2018equitable tolling.\u2019 \u201c Id. at 2560 (citing Irwin,\n498 U.S. at  95-96) (emphasis added). This limitation, of course, is inconsistent with Irwin\u2019s holding,\nwhic h provided  for equitable tolling in  a wa iver-of- immunity statute.\nWhile a determination that a condition is \u201cjurisdictional\u201d commonly means that a court may  not\nexpand or contract the provisi on through equi table doctrines like tolling and  waiver, t he determination\nmay not be conclusive, at  least with respect to equitable tolling. Bec ause the gra nt of Article III\njurisdiction for suits agains t the Un ited States is ultimately a m atter of congres sional intent to waive the\ngovernment's soverei gn im munity, th ere is no reason that the intent may not include, under certain\ncircumstances, equitable exceptions. Those circumstan ces, howe ver, must be  closely tied to congress ional\nintent. As d escribed below, t he Supreme Court  and other courts have cons idered whe ther the Irwin\npresumpti on of equitable tolling has  been rebutted, even af ter finding th at a statute of limitations was\njurisdictional. See John R. S and & Grav el Co., 552  U.S. 13 0, 13 7-38 (2008 ); Marley v. Uni ted States, 567\nF.3d 1030 , 103 6-37 (9th Cir. 200 9). Finally, whil e applying spec ific equitable exceptions to a\njurisdictional condition as a matt er of congress ional intent is one thing, f inding th at a jurisdictional\ncondition can be waived is  quite another. To allow an agency of t he executive bra nch of the Uni ted States\nto waive a j urisdictional condition established in a congress ional waiver-of-im munity statute woul d\nviola te the separation of power s doctrine. See Kont rick v. Ry an, 540  U.S. 44 3, 45 2 (2004 ) (stating \u201c[ o]nly\nCongres s may  determine a lower  federal court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction\u201d) (citing U.S. Co nst. art. III,\n\u00a7 1). \nSignif icantly, cou rts that have r eflexivel y foll owed Irwin to find that the FT CA\u2019s  statute of\nlimitations was subject to equitable tolling have gener ally failed to recognize tha t Irwin\u2019s presumption in\nfavor of  equitable tolling was  rebuttable. Few c ourts have c losely anal yzed the FTCA\u2019s  language, pur pose,\nand legisla tive his tory to de termine wh ether Congres s intended for equitable tolling of  the FT CA\u2019s  statute\nof limitations. The Supreme Court 's 2008 John R. S and & Grav el decision provided  additional insight\nregardi ng how a c ourt should analyze congres sional intent with respect to the FT CA\u2019s  statute of\nlimitations. Un derstanding th at case and subsequent decisions, a federal government a ttorney def ending\nthe United States in an FTCA act ion can set forth the best argument that the FT CA\u2019s  statute of limitations\nshould not be equitably toll ed.\nIII. The impact of John R. Sand & Gravel on the determination of whether the\nFTCA's statute of limitations is jurisdictional   \nThe signif icance of characterizing a s tatute of limitations as a \u201cjurisdictional\u201d prerequisite for\nbringing an ac tion agains t the Un ited States became m ore clear with the Supreme Court 's decision in the\nJohn R. S and & Grav el case. The plaintiff mini ng com pany had f iled an action in the Un ited States Cou rt\nof Fede ral Claims alleging tha t certain actions of the Environ mental Protection Agency, in b uilding and\nmoving v arious fences as part of enviro nmental remediation efforts, wer e unconstitutional takings of  its\nleasehold rights . 552  U.S. a t 132. W hile the Un ited States had initially asse rted that several  of the claims\nwere untimely under  the statute of limitations for actions in the Un ited States Cou rt of Federal Claims, 25\nU.S.C. \u00a7 2501 , the government l ater effectively con ceded that certain claims were timely. 552 U.S. a t 132.\nThe Un ited States won  the case on the meri ts and the plaintiff appealed. Id. at 132-33. T he Co urt of\nAppea ls for the Federal Circuit considered itself obliged to address the application of the statute of\nlimitations whi ch had been raised in an amicus  brief, though no t by the government. See John R. S and &\n16 UNITED STATES ATTORNEYS\u2019 BULLETIN NOVEMBER 2010\nGrav el Co. v . Uni ted States, 457  F.3d  1345, 13 52 (Fed. Cir. 200 6). The appellate court found  that the\nUnited States could not waive the statute of limitations because it was jurisdictional and concluded that\nthe action wa s untimely. Id. at 1353-60. T hus, the Supreme Cou rt was asked to determine whet her a court\nmust consider the timeli ness of a suit brought i n the court of claims, des pite the government\u2019 s apparent\nwaiver of  the issue. 552 U.S.  at 133.\nThe Supreme Court  found that two types of  statutes of limitations exist. On  one hand, the typical\ngarden  variety stat ute of limitations seeks t o protect defendants from \u201cst ale or unduly del ayed cl aims.\u201d Id.\nThis comm on statute of limitations must b e raised as an affirmati ve def ense, is subject to waiver, an d may\nbe tolled \u201cin light of  special equitable considerations.\u201d Id. (citing ca ses). On  the other hand, some statutes\nof limitations do not merely \u201cprot ect a defendant's case-specific interest in timeliness,\u201d but seek \u201ct o\nachieve a br oader syste m-related goal,  such as facilitating the adminis tration of claims . . . limiti ng the\nscope of a governmental waiver of  sover eign im munity . . .  o r promoti ng judicial efficiency.\u201d Id. (citing\ncases). The Co urt noted that it had often determined these latter statutes to be \u201cmore a bsolute, say as\nrequiring a cou rt to decide a timeli ness question despite a waiver, or  as forbidding a cou rt to consider\nwhet her certain equitable considerations warrant extending a l imita tions period.\u201d Id. at 133-34 (citing\ncases). The Co urt explained that \u201c[a]s conveni ent shorthand, [it] has someti mes referred to the time li mits\nin such statutes as \u2018jurisdictional.\u2019 \u201c Id. at 134 (citing Bowl es v. Ru ssell, 551  U.S. 20 5, 21 0 (2007 )).\nBase d upon this dichotomy  alone, one  woul d conclude that the FT CA\u2019s  statute of limitations falls\nin the latter category of ab solute statutes. Like the  comm on statutes of limitations, the FTCA\u2019s  statute\ncertainly prot ects the Un ited States from having to d efend again st \u201cstale or unduly del ayed cl aims.\u201d Id. at\n133. Indeed, to support this purpose for comm on statutes of limitations, the John R. S and & Grav el Cour t\ncited Kubr ick, the seminal  FTCA st atute of limitations case. Id. at 133 (citing Kubr ick, 444  U.S. a t 117).\nBut the FTCA\u2019s  statute of limitations also seeks to  achieve at l east two of  the broader \u201csystem- related\ngoal[ s]\u201d that the Cou rt mentioned. Id. at 133. First, the FTCA\u2019s  statute of limitations facilitates \u201cthe\nadminis tration of claims;\u201d it is part and parcel of the FT CA\u2019s  admini strative exha ustion requirement. See\nMarley v. Uni ted States, 567  F.3d  1030, 10 36 (9th Cir. 200 9). Unde r the statute, a tort claimant must first\npresent the claim to t he appropriate federal agency wit hin 2 year s of accrual; the agency then  has 6 months\nto attempt to resolve the  claim before the claimant c an file suit in federal court. 28 U.S.C. \n\u00a7\u00a7 2401(b), 2675(a) (2010 ). Second, the FTCA\u2019s  statute of limitations limits  the scope of the\ngovernment\u2019s waiver of  its soverei gn im munity. T he Kubr ick Cour t called the FTCA\u2019s  statute of\nlimitations a \u201ccondition of [the] waiver\u201d  of imm unity. 444 U.S. at  117-18.  Simila rly, in United States v.\nDalm , 494  U.S. 59 6 (1990 ), the Supreme Court  found that a limitations period for seeking a ta x refund\nwas jurisdictional because it was a condition on the authority Congres s had given to  courts \u201cin permitting\nsuits again st the [g]overnment.\u201d  Id. at 609-10. T he Co urt emphasi zed, th at \u201c[i]f any pri nciple is central to\nour understanding of  sover eign im munity, it is that the power to consent to such suits is reserved t o\nCongres s.\u201d Id. at 610. \nThe analysis t hat the Supreme Cou rt employed i n John R. S and & Grav el to determine that the\nstatute of limitations at issue, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2501, wa s the \u201csecond, more absolute, kind o f limita tions\nperiod,\u201d is instructive. John R. S and & Grav el, 552  U.S. a t 134. T he Co urt primari ly cons idered how it\nhad historically int erpreted this statute of limitations and its predecessor statutes. Fo r example, the Cour t\nnoted that as early as 188 3, it had denied equitable tolling fo r a prior versi on of the statute, stating that  the\nstatute was \u201cjurisdiction[al],\u201d and \u201cnot susceptible to judicial \u2018engraf t[ing]\u2019  of unlisted disabilities.\u201d Id.\nThe Co urt found that it had a duty to co nsider the timeli ness of the action whet her it was raised \u201cby plea\nor not.\u201d Id. (quoting Kend all v. Un ited States, 107  U.S. 12 3, 12 5-26 (1883 )). Sub sequently, the Co urt\nreiterated vie ws about \u201cthe more absolute nature of the court of claims li mitations statute.\u201d Id. at 134-35\n(citing ca ses).\nNOVEMBER 2010 UNITED STATES ATTORNEYS\u2019 BULLETIN 17\nThe Co urt found that the change of l anguage of  the court of claims st atute of limitations in the\n1948  recodification of Title 28 wa s not signif icant, even t hough t he current statute, unlike the prior\nversi on, s tates that it is applicable to claims of which the Co urt of Federal Claims \u201c has jurisdiction.\u201d 552\nU.S. at  135 (quoting  28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2501 ) (emphasi s in John R. S and & Grav el). The petitioner argued th at\nthis language sh owed that the statute of limitations could not be \u201cjurisdictional\u201d because it only appli ed to\nclaims over  which the court already had j urisdiction. The Co urt rejected this argument, noting th at the\n1948  recodification did not work a ch ange i n the underlying subst antive law, \u201c unless an intent to make\nsuch a change is  clearly expr essed.\u201d 552 U.S. a t 136 (quoting Keene Co rp. v. Uni ted States, 508  U.S. 20 0,\n209 (1993)). The new language di d not reflect an intent to change the  application of the statute and the\nCour t noted that subsequent to the 1948 recodification, in Soriano v. United States, 352  U.S. 27 0 (1957 ),\nit had found that the statute was  \u201c \u2018jurisdictional[al]\u2019 and not susceptible to equitable tolling.\u201d John R.\nSand  & Grav el, 552  U.S. a t 136 (quoting Soriano, 352  U.S. a t 273-74).\nThe petitioner also argued t hat, in Irwin, the Cou rt overt urned its earlier precedents regardi ng the\njurisdictional nature of the court of claims li mitations period because the statute of limitations at issue in\nTitle VII was \u201clingui stically similar\u201d to the court of claims st atute. Id. at 137. While admitting that  the\nstatute was linguist ically similar to the statute at issue in Irwin, the Cou rt noted a key distinction:  the\nSupr eme Court  had previous ly pro vided a  definitive int erpretation of the court of claims li mitations period\nas \u201cjurisdictional,\u201d whe reas the civil rights  statute had no s uch pedigree . Id. Moreover, t he Co urt noted\nthat the Irwin Cour t would not have i mplicitly overruled the Soriano Cour t\u2019s precedential interpretation of\nthe court of claims statute of limitations as \u201cjurisdictional.\u201d Id. Most signifi cantly, however, t he Co urt\nrecognized t hat the Irwin Cour t held that a presumpti on of equitable tolling fo r suits agains t the\ngovernment was rebuttable; in other words, the presumption wa s not conclusive. Id. That presumption\ncould be rebutted not only by specific statutory la nguage \u2013 fo r example, indicating a c ontrary\ncongress ional intent \u2013 but also through \u201ca d efinitive ear lier interpretation of the statute, finding a s imila r\ncongress ional intent.\u201d Id. at 137-38. T he Co urt concluded that prior Supr eme Court  decisions interpreting\nthe court of claims statute of limitations in absolute terms as \u201c jurisdictional\u201d and \u201cnot susceptible\u201d to\ntolling or wa vier, were sufficient to rebut any con trary pres umption allowin g equit able exceptions. Id. at\n138. Thus, the Cou rt at least impli ed that the Irwin analysis could apply to a jurisdictional statute of\nlimitations.\nThe Co urt stated that Irwin and the prior cases interpreting th e court of claims st atute of\nlimitations did not create a \u201ccritical anomaly,\u201d but  rather reflected \u201ca different judicial assumpti on about\nthe compara tive weight Co ngress  woul d likely to  have a ttached to competing le gitimate interests.\u201d Id. at\n139. On on e hand, there is the interest in treating th e government s imila rly to a p rivate l itigant  as reflected\nin Irwin. On t he other hand, there is the interest in strictly int erpreting the conditions of a statute that\nwaives th e government\u2019 s soverei gn im munity, as  reflected in Soriano and other cases interpreting th e\ncourt of claims statute. Re solution of these competing in terests requires a determinat ion of the\ncongress ional intent at the time of a  statute\u2019s enactment.  \nWhile there wer e many Supre me Cou rt cases interpreting th e current court of claims statute of\nlimitations and its predecessors, the same is n ot the case for the FT CA. T he only Supr eme Court  case\ninterpreting the FTCA\u2019s  statute of limitations is Kubr ick, and the Kubr ick Cour t did not directly addr ess\nwhet her the FT CA\u2019s  statute of limitations is jurisdictional, let alone whe ther it is subject to tolling,\nwaiver, or  estoppel. Kubr ick\u2019s statements that the FTCA\u2019s  statute of limitations is a \u201ccondition of [the]\nwaiver\u201d o f soverei gn im munity, and  that the Cou rt \u201cshould not take it  upon [itself] to extend the wai ver\nbeyond t hat which Co ngress  intended,\u201d 444 U.S. at  117-18, wo uld lead one to conclude that the FT CA\u2019s\nstatute of limitations is jurisdictional or at least subject to a strict construction. Yet , the statements are, in\n18 UNITED STATES ATTORNEYS\u2019 BULLETIN NOVEMBER 2010\na sense, dicta and thus do not carry the  weight of  the long li ne of court of claims cas es that the Supreme\nCour t cited in John R. S and & Grav el.  \nTherefore, the dichotomy  between  comm on and \u201cmore absolute\u201d statutes of limitations that begins\nthe Supr eme Court \u2019s analysis in John R. S and & Grav el is helpful, but not sufficient, in answering th e\nquestion of whet her the FTCA\u2019s  statute of limitations is subject to equitable tolling. Irwin shows that a\nstatute of limitations in a waiver-of-im munity statute may sti ll be tolled. So , determinin g whethe r a statute\nof limitations is jurisdictional may not necessarily answer  the question of whet her it can be tolled. The\njurisdictional nature of the statute may  be just one consideration among  others in determinin g whethe r\nCongres s intended for equitable exceptions to the limita tions period.\nIV. Caselaw analyzing the FTCA's statute of limitations after John R. Sand & Gravel\nSince the John R. S and & Grav el decision, courts, wi th one signifi cant exception, h ave fo und that\nthe FTCA\u2019s  statute of limitations was jurisdictional and not subject to equitable tolling or  waiver.  T he\nfirst maj or case, Marley v. Uni ted States, 567  F.3d  1030 (9th Cir. 200 9), involved app lication of the\nFTCA\u2019s  6-month statute of limitations for filing sui t after agency den ial of a claim. Id. at 1032-34. T he\nplaintiff initially filed a timely com plaint, but then dismissed the complaint pursuant to a stipulation that\nhad been sent by the Assistant United States Attorney. Id. at 1032-33. T he plaintiff subsequently filed\nanother action outside of the 6-month period but argued th at the period should be tolled because in a cover\nletter accompanying the  stipulation he had been misl ed to believe th at he could file a subsequent suit on\nthe same claim if t he action were dismisse d \u201cwi thout prejudice.\u201d Id. at 1033-34.  \nThe Ni nth Circuit Court of Appe als found  that the FT CA\u2019s  statute of limitations was\njurisdictional and could not be equitably toll ed. Id. at 1034-38. In rea ching thi s conclusion, the court\napplied the recent John R. S and & Grav el analysis. Id. at 1034-35. Initi ally, th e court noted that the\nFTCA\u2019s  statute of limitations was a condition of the federal government\u2019 s waiver of sovere ign imm unity\nthat must be strictly const rued. Id. at 1034 (citing Block, 461 U.S. at  287 and Kubr ick, 444  U.S. a t 117-18. \nThe court found  that the FTCA\u2019s  statute of limitations was a \u201cmore a bsolute\u201d and \u201cjurisdictional\u201d statute\nof limitations, but not merely becau se it was contained within a waiver-of-im munity statute. Id. at 1035.\nAs the Supreme Court  had looked to  its past precedents in interpreting th e court of claims st atute of\nlimitations in John R. S and & Grav el, the Ninth Circuit also looked t o its past precedents in interpreting\nthe FTCA\u2019s  statute of limitations. Marley, 567 F.3d at 1035-36. T he court found  that it had long held  that\nthe FTCA\u2019s  statute of limitations was jurisdictional and not subject to tolling in  light of  equitable\nconsiderations. Id. (citing among  other cases Berti v. V.A. Hos p., 860  F.2d  338, 340  (9th Cir. 198 8);\nAugu stine v. Un ited States, 704  F.2d  1074, 10 77 (9th Cir. 198 3); Blain v. Uni ted States, 552  F.2d  289, 291\n(9th Cir. 1977) (per curiam); Mann v. Uni ted States, 399  F.2d  672, 673  (9th Cir. 196 8)).   \nThe court held, ho wever, t hat it woul d reach the same conc lusion in the absence of its past\nprecedent regardi ng the FTCA\u2019s  statute of limitations. Marley, 567  F.3d  at 1036. First, the court found\nthat the purpose of the 6-m onth limita tions period fell \u201csquarely\u201d wit hin the \u201cmore absolute\u201d category of\nstatutes of limitations described in John R. S and & Grav el because it sought t o \u201cachieve a b roader syste m-\nrelated goal,  such as facilitating the adminis tration of claims.\u201d Id. (quoting John R. S and & Grav el, 552\nU.S. at  133). The court also noted that the legisl ative hi story of  the FT CA\u2019s  statute of limitations\nsugg ested \u201cthat Congress  did not intend for equitable tolling to  apply.\u201d 56 7 F.3 d at 1036-37 (citing Ug o\nCole lla & Ada m Bain, Revisiting Equi table Tolling and the Federal Tort Claims  Act:  Putting the\nLegislative History in Proper Perspective, 31 SETON HALL L. REV. 174  (2000)). Finally, the c ourt found\nthat the statutory \u201cc ontext\u201d for the FTCA's limita tions period showed t hat Congres s did not intend for\nequitable exceptions to apply. 567 F.3d at 1037. The court noted that Congres s had explicitly incl uded\nNOVEMBER 2010 UNITED STATES ATTORNEYS\u2019 BULLETIN 19\nsome equ itable exceptions in a gene ral statute of limitations for civil actions agains t the Un ited States, 28\nU.S.C. \u00a7 2401 (a), including \u201cle gal di sability or be yond th e seas,\u201d id., but had included no such exceptions\nin 28 U.S. C. \u00a7 2 401(b). 567 F.3d  at 1037. The court concluded that \u201c[i]f Congress  had intended to grant\nexceptions to the \u00a7 2401(b) limita tions period, it woul d have done  so expressly, as i t did in \u00a7 2401(a).\u201d\n567 F.3d at 1037 (citing United States v. Fiorillo, 186  F.3d  1136, 11 53 (9th Cir. 199 9) (per curiam)).  \nIn sum, the Ninth Circuit in Marley not only consi dered its prior precedent, finding th at the\nFTCA\u2019s  statute of limitations was jurisdictional, but also considered the function of the statute, its\nlegisla tive his tory, and i ts statutory cont ext. These considerations provided  persuasive evidenc e of\ncongress ional intent that would have s ufficiently rebut ted the Irwin presumption of equitable tolling had\nthe court found it necessary to ap ply th e presumption. S ince Marley, several  courts have cit ed it and John\nR. Sa nd &  Grav el with little additional analysis t o find that the FT CA's statute of limitations is\njurisdictional and not subject to equitable tolling. See, e.g., Waltz v. Uni ted States, No.\n1:07-cv-0169 1-SMS , 201 0 WL 128 6777 , at *3-5 (E.D. Cal. Mar. 29, 2010); Jones v. Uni ted States, 691\nF.Sup p. 2d  639, 641  (E.D.N.C. 20 10); In re FEM A Tra iler Forma ldehyde Prods. Liab. L itig., MDL No.\n07-1873 , 201 0 WL 323 898, at *4 (E.D. La . Jan. 21, 2 010).      \nThe signif icant exception to this trend is Santos v. Uni ted States, 559  F.3d  189, 194 -97 (3d Ci r.\n2009 ), in whi ch the Third Circuit Cour t of Appeals found that the 2-year p eriod in the FT CA\u2019s  statute of\nlimitations could be equitably toll ed. In Santos, the plaintiff in a medic al malpractice action claimed that\nthe statute of limitations should be equitably toll ed because she \u201cdid not know t hat the allegedly negli gent\nhealthcare provider s had been deemed f ederal employees.\u201d  Id. at 192. The court recognized th at John R.\nSand  & Grav el, and other Supr eme Court  cases \u201cmig ht call into question whet her equitable tolling is\navail able in FT CA cl aims.\u201d Id. at 196 (citing John R. S and & Grav el, 552  U.S. a t 137; United States v.\nBegg erly, 524  U.S. 38 , 48-49 (19 98); United States v. Br ockamp, 519  U.S. 34 7, 35 0-54 (1997 ); and\nKubr ick, 444  U.S. a t 117-18). Nevert heless, the court noted that its prior precedent, relying upon Irwin,\nhad found that \u201cthe FTCA\u2019s  statute of limitations is not jurisdictional, and thus in appropriate\ncircumstances the equitable tolling doc trine can apply in  actions under it.\u201d 559 F. 3d at 194-95 (citing\nHughe s v. Uni ted States, 263  F.3d  272, 278  (3d Cir. 2001)). The court explained that \u201cIrwin remains good\nlaw\u201d an d that John R. S and & Grav el \u201capplied but did not overr ule Irwin in holding that  its presumption\nthat equitable tolling app lied had been rebutted.\u201d Santos, 559  F.3d  at 197 (citing John R. S and & Grav el,\n552 U.S. at  137).   \nHowever, the only evidence of congress ional intent that the Santos Cour t considered to determine\nwhet her the Irwin presumption in favor of  equitable tolling was  rebutted was  the FT CA\u2019s  savings cla use\nfor actions filed in the wr ong for um. This section states that claims bro ught er roneously in st ate court\nagains t a federal employee a re timely notwi thstanding the 2-year l imita tion of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2401(b), if the\nclaim woul d have been  timely had i t been filed on the date the state court action wa s commenced and the\nclaim is presented to the appropriate federal agency wit h 60 days of  the dismissa l of the state court action.\nSee 28 U.S .C. \u00a7 2 679(d)(5) (2010). The Un ited States had argued th at the court should not recognize\nadditional non-statutory exc eptions because Congres s had explicitly provide d for this statutory exc eption\nand, indeed the plaintiff in Santos had initially filed her action in the wr ong cour t. This argument is the\nstandard canon of statutory cons truction, expressio unius est exclusio alterius, whic h means t he\nexpression of one is the exclusion of another. The Ni nth Circuit in Marley had, in essence, applied this\ncanon in comparing se ctions 2401(a) and 2401(b) and inferring con gress ional intent to exclude any\nequitable exceptions for the FTCA\u2019s  statute of limitations. Marley, 567  F.3d  at 1037. See also TRW Inc. v.\nAndr ews, 534  U.S. 19 , 28 (2001) (applying the c anon to a discovery ru le for a federal statute of\nlimitations). The Santos court rejected the government\u2019 s argum ent, concluding that  the savings cl ause was\ndistinct from the FT CA\u2019s  limitations provisi on and thus not relevant t o congress ional intent with respect\n20 UNITED STATES ATTORNEYS\u2019 BULLETIN NOVEMBER 2010\nto equitable tolling of  the FT CA\u2019s  statute of limitations. Santos, 559  F.3d  at 196. The court also found  that\nthe FTCA\u2019s  gener al waiver of  sover eign im munity, sub jecting th e Uni ted States to liability \u201cto the same\nextent as a private i ndividual  under like cir cumstan ces,\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2674 (2010 ), justified applyin g\nequitable tolling. Santos, 559  F.3d  at 197. The court did not consider whet her the FTCA\u2019s  statute of\nlimitations was of the \u201cmore absolute\u201d vari ety under  the John R. S and & Grav el dichotomy or an alyze\nother evide nce of legisla tive int ent, such as the surround ing la nguage in t he statute, the statute\u2019s purposes,\nand its legisl ative hi story. \nV. Indications of congressional intent regarding equitable tolling of the FTCA\u2019s\nstatute of limitations in its text, purpose, and legislative history\nRece nt Supr eme Court  cases show that it is import ant to consider the text of the statute, its\npurposes, and its legisl ative hi story in  order to determine whet her Congres s intended for the statute of\nlimitation at issue to be subject to equitable tolling. T hese cases demonstrate that Irwin\u2019s presumption in\nfavor of  equitable tolling ca n indeed be rebutted. The cases also illustrate the types of  evide nce of\ncongress ional intent that the Co urt has found persuasive. For example, in United States v. Br ockamp, 519\nU.S. 34 7 (1997 ), the Co urt reasoned that Congres s did not intend for courts to incorporate \u201cother\nunmenti oned, op en ended \u2018equitable\u2019 exceptions\u201d because it included specific tolling pr ovisi ons within\nthe language of a  tax refund statute. Id. at 351-52. T he Co urt also noted the \u201cunus ually em phatic\u201d form of\nthe time limita tions which \u201ccannot easily be r ead as containing im plicit exceptions.\u201d Id. at 350. Finally,\nthe Cour t discussed the purpose of the statute, its administrative im plications, and its legisla tive his tory,\nall of which evide nced a congress ional objective of  \u201cstrong st atutory \u2018pr otection again st stale demands,\u2019 \u201c\nwhic h woul d preclude tolling. Id. at 352-54. \nSimila rly, in United States v. Be ggerly, 524  U.S. 38  (1998), the Cou rt found that Congress  did not\nintend to allow equitable tolling fo r the Qu iet Title Act because the Ac t \u201calready ef fectively al lowe d for\nequitable tolling\u201d given t hat a cause of action did not accrue until the plaintiff \u201cknew or should have\nknown of  the claim of t he Un ited States.\u201d Id. at 48. Addi tionally, the Co urt noted that the 12-year\nlimitations period wa s already \u201cunus ually genero us\u201d and any \u201ca dditional equitable tolling\u201d wou ld be\ncontrary to a c entral purpose of the Act , whi ch wa s to create certainty with r espect to property rights  and\nwhen those rights c an be challenged. Id. at 48-49. See also TRW  Inc. v. Andr ews, 534  U.S. 19 , 28 (2001)\n(finding th at the existence of a limite d discovery rul e for a statute of limitations reflected a congress ional\nintent to preclude a more gene ral discovery ru le). \nThe Co urt has also described the type of eviden ce that is not sufficient to show that Congres s\nintended to preclude equitable tolling of  a statute of limitations. Most recently, in Holland v. Florida, 130\nS.Ct.  2549 (2010 ), the Co urt held that equitable tolling app lied to the 1-year s tatute of limitations in the\nAntiterrorism and Ef fective Dea th Pena lty Act of  1996 (AEDPA), wh ich gov erns petitions for federal\nhabeas relief by sta te prisoners. 28 U.S.C.\u00a7 2 244(d) (2010). The Co urt initially noted  that this statute of\nlimitations was not \u201cjurisdictional.\u201d Holland, 130  S.Ct . at 2560. Nex t, the Co urt found that the strength o f\nIrwin\u2019s presumption in favor of  equitable tolling was  \u201creinforced,\u201d because equitable principles had\ntraditionally governe d the substantive law o f habeas corpus and because the AEDP A had  been passed\nafter the Co urt\u2019s Irwin decision. Thus, Congre ss was likely aware  that courts wou ld apply the\npresumpti on. Id. at 2560-61. \nIn contrasting th e AEDPA\u2019 s statute of limitations to those at issue in Broc kamp  and Begg erly, the\nCour t found  that the statute was  neither \u201cunus ually em phatic,\u201d nor \u201cparticularly long.\u201d Id. at 2561.\nMoreover, i n contrast to law gov erning tax r efund and land claims, whic h wer e at issue in those cases,\n\u201cequity find s a comfor table home\u201d i n habeas corpus law. Id. Further, the Co urt discounted the argum ent\nNOVEMBER 2010 UNITED STATES ATTORNEYS\u2019 BULLETIN 21\nthat the statute already set forth equitable exceptions that woul d raise an inference that Congres s intended\nto exclude open-ended equitable tolling. Id. at 2561-62. T he Co urt explained that several  exceptions\nrelated to event s that triggered, rather than tolled, the statute and that the only tol ling provis ion during\nstate collateral review was  explained simply by the  necessity of an  exhaustion of state remedies. Thus, the\nprovisio ns wo uld not rightly ra ise an inference of congress ional intent to preclude other tolling. Id.\nFinally, th e Cou rt found that allowin g equit able tolling woul d not undermine t he purposes of the AEDPA\nbecause the statute sought t o eliminat e delays in t he federal habeas review pr ocess \u201cwithout unde rminin g\nbasic habeas corpus principles,\u201d including the \u201cvita l role\u201d of habeas corpus in protecting con stitutional\nrights. Id. at 2562 (citing Slack v. McDani el, 529  U.S. 47 3, 48 3 (2000 )). See also Young  v. Un ited States,\n535 U.S. 43 , 50-53 (20 02) (finding th at equitable tolling app lied to a limitations period in bankrupt cy law\nbecause bankrupt cy cour ts are traditionally equi table, and the tolling pr ovisi on that was included was\ndistinct from traditional equitable tolling and  therefore did not reflect congress ional intent to preclude\ntraditional equitable tolling).     \nAppl ying the r easoning of t hese cases to the FTCA re veals  that there are several  arguments that\nthe FTCA\u2019s  statute of limitations should not be equitably to lled. First, Congre ss passed the FT CA lo ng\nbefore the Cou rt decided Irwin. In contrast to the situation in Holland, Congre ss woul d have no r eason to\nbelieve tha t a presumption in favor of  equitable tolling woul d apply to  the FT CA st atute of limitations.\nSee Holland, 130 S.Ct.  at 2561. If anythi ng, when Co ngress  passed the FT CA in  1946, it was operating\nagains t a comm on law ba ckground that recognized f ew eq uitable exceptions to statutes of limitations as a\nmatter of common law. See Adam Bain & Ugo Col ella, Interpreting Federal Statutes of Limi tations, 37\nCREIGHTON L. REV. 493 , 501 -22 (2004 ) (discussing equi table exceptions recognized at  comm on law). \nSecond, claims under the FT CA ar e possible only thro ugh an a ct of Congres s waiving the  United States\u2019\nsovere ign imm unity. T hus, the law governi ng fede ral tort claims is purely statutory and not an area, such\nas habeas corpus or bankrupt cy, in wh ich equitable doctrines have t raditionally appl ied, mak ing th e Irwin\npresumpti on particularly apt . See Holland, 130  S.Ct . at 2561-62 (habeas corpus); Young , 535  U.S. a t 50\n(bankrupt cy). In fact, courts have hel d that equitable remedies  are not availa ble under the FT CA. See\nWestbay Steel, Inc. v. Uni ted States, 970  F.2d  648, 651  (9th Cir.1992) (barring equ itable claim for unjust\nenrichment again st United States unde r the FTCA).\nAddi tionally, the l anguage of  the FT CA\u2019s  statute of limitations, like the time li mitations at issue\nin Broc kamp , is emphati c. The statute of limitations provides  that a failure to meet e ither prescriptive\nperiod means that the claim is \" forever b arred.\" 28 U.S .C. \u00a7 2 401(b) (2010). While the 2-year p eriod for\nfiling a cl aim, by it self, is not as gener ous as the 12-year p eriod in Begg erly, the application of a discovery\nrule of accrual means that many cas es can be filed many  years  after the allegedly negli gent c ondu ct\noccurred. In fact, the Begg erly Cour t found  that the existence of such a discovery ru le in the Qui et Title\nAct was a good r eason to preclude other equitable tolling. Begg erly, 524  U.S. a t 48-49.\nThere are also good arguments for application of the canon expressio unius est exclusio alterius to\nsupport the conclusion that Congres s did not intend equitable tolling fo r the FTCA. Initially, as t he Ni nth\nCircuit noted in Marley, the gener al 6-year s tatute of limitations for civil actions agains t the government\nallows  for particular types  of traditional equitable tolling, na mely \u201clegal  disability\u201d and \u201c beyond t he seas,\u201d\n28 U.S. C. \u00a7 2 401(a) (2010), wher eas the FT CA\u2019s  statute of limitations does not provide f or any\ndisabilities. Marley, 567  F.3d  at 1037. The gene ral 6-year s tatute of limitations for civil actions, 28 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 2401(a), is right nex t to the FTCA\u2019s  statute of limitations for tort actions, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2401(b).\nHowever, the proximity of t he two pr ovisi ons does not necessarily lead to an inference of congress ional\nintent. The two su bsections had distinct origins. T he 6-year s tatute of limitations, now in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\n2401 (a), original ly inc luded the followin g traditional equitable tolling exc eption:  \n22 UNITED STATES ATTORNEYS\u2019 BULLETIN NOVEMBER 2010\nProv ided, That the claims of marr ied women, fi rst accrued during m arriage, of  persons\nunde r age of t went y-one years , first accrued during m inority, and  of idiots, lunatics,\ninsane persons, and persons beyond th e seas at the time the  claim accrued, entitled to the\nclaim, shall not be barred if the suit be brought wi thin three year s after the disability has\nceased; but no other disability tha n those enumerat ed shall prevent a ny cla im from bei ng\nbarred, no r shall any of t he said disabilities operate cumulatively.\nJudicial Code , Act  of Mar. 3, 191 1, \u00a7 34, \u00b6 20 , 36 Stat. 1093. This provisi on wa s in effect at the time\nCongres s passed the FTCA in  1946, see 28 U.S .C., 19 40 ed. \u00a7 41(20), yet Con gress  did not provid e for\nany suc h disabilities or other equitable exceptions in the FT CA\u2019s  statute of limitations. Fe deral Tort\nClaims Act \u00a7 420, 60  Stat. 842, 8 45 (1946 ). Thus, one  could argue tha t Congress  intentionally plac ed\ntraditional equitable exceptions into a statute of limitations for civil actions agains t the Un ited States\ngovernment prior to 1946 and intentionally chose  not to do s o for the FTCA.  \nWhen Title 28 o f the Un ited States Cod e was  revised  in 1948, the two st atutes of limitations were\nplaced next to each other. See H.R. Rep . No. 8 0-308, at A185 (1948) (noting that  revised  section 2401 of\ntitle 28 \u201cconsolidates provisio n in section 41(20) of Title 28 U.S .C. 19 40 ed., as to time li mitation for\nbringing act ions agains t the Un ited States under section 1346(a) of this title, wi th section 942 of said title\n28 [statute of limitations for tort claims]\u201d) . Signifi cantly, the e quitable exception for the 6-year s tatute of\nlimitations was amended at that time so that the only dis abilities recognized we re \u201clegal d isability\u201d an d\n\u201cbeyond th e seas.\u201d See H.R. Rep . No. 8 0-308, at A185.  While the focus of the 1948 revisi on of the\nJudicial Code  was to codify witho ut substantively m odifying exi sting la w for statutes of limitations for\nactions agains t the Un ited States, see John R. S and & Grav el v. Uni ted States, 552  U.S. 13 0, 13 6 (2008 ),\nCongres s changed the  circumstances unde r which limita tions could be equitably to lled in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\n2401 . It narrowe d the type of disabilities that could toll the limita tions period in 28 U.S .C. \u00a7 2 401(a), yet\nleft the FT CA\u2019s  statute of limitations in Section 2401(b) without any exp licit equitable tolling at  all. Thus,\nthe inference that Congres s did not intend for equitable tolling to  be offered wi th regard t o the FTCA is\nfully justified through expressio unius est exclusio alterius as applied to the two su bsections in 28 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 2401. F urther, if not otherwise clear, the Reviser \u2019s Note shows  that no e quitable exceptions other than\nthose expressed in the section were intended. The No te states that a provisi on in the predecessor to 28\nU.S.C. \u00a7 2401 (a), wh ich provided  that \u201cdisabilities other than those specifically mentioned should not\nprevent a ny act ion from being[,] b arred was  omitt ed as superfluous.\u201d H.R. Rep. No. 80 -308 (emphasis\nadded). Thus, Congre ss did not need to explicitly stat e that equitable tolling th at was not included within\nthe statutes of limitations in section 2401 was  prohibited, because that was already ass umed.   \nThe other argum ent for application of expressio unius est exclusio alterius is the one the Third\nCircuit rejected in Santos, namely that  Congres s\u2019s inclusion of a savings pro visio n for circumstances in\nwhic h a plaintiff sued a federal employee in  an imprope r forum reflected congres sional understanding that\nother equitable tolling was  unavaila ble. Santos, 559  F.3d  at 196. The Santos court reasoned that the\nsavin gs cla use was placed in a distinct provisi on from the  FTCA\u2019s  statute of limitations. Id. Coup led\nhowever , with the history of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2401 (a) and its consolidation wi th the FTCA\u2019s  statute of\nlimitations in 1948, Co ngress \u2019s action in adopting th is particular savings pro visio n in 1988 indicates an\nunde rstanding that  other traditional equitable tolling was  not intended. An e quitable exception for\ncircumstances in whic h a plaintiff had filed an action in an imprope r forum had been recognized in  the\ncomm on law be fore the 1988 amendm ent to the FTCA. See Bain & Col ella, supra, 37 CREIGHTON L. REV.\nat 517-19 (discussing equi table exception for defective pl eading, wro ng for um, and constructive noti ce).\nThus, Congre ss\u2019 action in specifically addi ng thi s exception to the statute shows  that it had not intended\nfor this or any ot her open-ended equitable tolling fo r the FTCA\u2019s  limitations period whe n it enacted the\nstatute. \nNOVEMBER 2010 UNITED STATES ATTORNEYS\u2019 BULLETIN 23\nThe purpose and design of  the FT CA al so indicate that Congres s did not intend for open-ended\nequitable tolling. Fi rst, unlike some othe r \u201cremedial statutes,\u201d the FT CA is  a wa iver-of- immunity statute\nthat is subject to strict construction. See Block v. N.D. ex rel. Bd. of Univ . & Sch. Lan ds, 461  U.S. 27 3,\n287 (1983) (stating that  conditions on the wai ver of  sover eign im munity \u201cm ust be strictly obs erved\u201d).  \nSecond, as the Marley court recognized, the FTCA\u2019s  statute of limitations is a \u201ckey part \u201d of the\nadminis trative cl aim process, which is required before a plaintiff can bring an ac tion in federal court. \nMarley, 567  F.3d  at 1036. Indeed, as the Senate Judiciary Com mittee noted whe n the administrative cla im\nprocess was made pa rt of the FT CA in  1966, the process was designed t o \u201cease court congesti on\u201d and\nmake it  possible to \u201cexpedite the fair settlement of  tort claims asserted agains t the Un ited States.\u201d  S. Re p.\nNo. 89 -1327 , at 2 (1966 ) (quoted in Marley, 567  F.3d  at 1036). Allowin g open- ended equitable tolling\nwoul d subvert  this purpose by al lowing case s that woul d otherwise be barred and by del aying the\nsettlement a nd adjudication of timely clai ms. \nFinally, th e FT CA\u2019s  particular legisla tive his tory furt her supports the view t hat Congres s did not\nintend to incorporate equitable tolling in to the FTCA\u2019s  statute of limitations. A c omplete analysis of the\nFTCA\u2019s  legisla tive his tory with r espect to congress ional intent on equitable tolling is  beyond the scope of\nthis article, but this subject has been exhaustively cover ed in a law review ar ticle. See Ugo Cole lla &\nAdam Bain, supra, 31 SETON HALL L. REV. at 191-205. A fe w highlights  of the legisl ative hi story ar e\nworth noting to s how t hat Congres s did not intend for open-ended equitable tolling. Fi rst, prior to the\nFTCA\u2019s  enactment, many equ itable exceptions were propos ed and considered for the legisla tion \u2013\nincluding th ose for disability, fo r infancy, and  even f or \u201creasonable cause shown\u201d i n certain categorie s of\ncases \u2013 but none of these exceptions were adopted in the final statute. See id. at 190-97. Ad ditionally,\nsubsequent to the FTCA\u2019s  enactment, Congre ss amended t he FTCA sever al times to correct perceived\ninjustices resulting fro m the application of the statute of limitations. In 1949, Co ngress  lengthen ed the\nlimitations period. In 1966, it provided  for an administrative cla im proc ess. And, as referenced above, in\n1988 , it adopted a savin gs provis ion for circumstan ces in which a plaintiff sued a federal employee i n\nstate court when the plaintiff\u2019s action should have be en brought again st the Uni ted States in federal court.\nId. at 200-05. T hese amendments all reflected congres sional understanding that  equitable exceptions were\nunavaila ble to plaintiffs under the FT CA. Id. at 197-205. Congres s also repeatedly rejected amendments\nwhic h woul d have all owed tolling for  certain conditions, including inf ancy and i nsanity. Id. at 198-99;\nH.R. 102 3, 99 th Cong. (19 85) (A Bi ll to amend 240 1 of title 28, Uni ted States Code , to extend the time for\npresenting tor t claims to persons under legal di sability). See also M cCal l v. Uni ted States, 310  F.3d  984,\n988 (7th Cir. 2002) (noting that  in 1989 Con gress  considered a propos ed amendment to the FT CA, whi ch\nwoul d have tol led the statute of limitations for minors but the amendment never  made it out of\ncomm ittee). Thus, the legisl ative hi story cl early reflects congres sional intent to preclude tolling. See\nMarley, 567  F.3d  at 1036-37 (\u201c[T]he legisla tive his tory of \u00a7 2 401(b) of the FTCA suggests  that Congres s\ndid not intend for equitable tolling to  apply.\u201d); Wukawitz v. Uni ted States, 170  F.Sup p2d 1165 , 116 9 (D.\nUtah 2001) (stating \u201cit  is clear from the legisl ative hi story of  the FT CA th at Congres s did not intend for\nequitable tolling to  apply to the limitations period.\u201d).\nThus, irrespective of  whet her the FT CA\u2019s  statute of limitations is jurisdictional, good r easons in\nthe text, purposes, and legisla tive his tory of t he statute exist to overc ome Irwin\u2019s presumption in favor of\nequitable tolling and  to demonst rate that Congres s did not intend such tolling fo r the FTCA\u2019s  statute of\nlimitations.\nVI. Arguing that the FTCA\u2019s statute of limitations is not subject to equitable tolling\nThe Supreme Court \u2019s John R. S and & Grav el opinion, coupled wi th an analysis o f the subsequent\nfederal caselaw, t he text of the FT CA, it s purposes, and its legisla tive his tory, provide  the federal\n24 UNITED STATES ATTORNEYS\u2019 BULLETIN NOVEMBER 2010\ngovernment attorney wit h a strong arse nal of weap ons to argue tha t the FTCA\u2019s  statute of limitations is\nnot subject to equitable tolling. Ass uming th at there is no controlling pr ecedent since the Supreme Court \u2019s\nJohn R. S and & Grav el decision in the federal jurisdiction wher e the matt er is at issue, the attorney shou ld\nconsider the followin g argum ents:\nCBetween  the two types of  statutes of limitations described in John R. S and & Grav el, the\nFTCA\u2019s  statute of limitations is a \u201cmore a bsolute\u201d statute of limitations because it seeks\nto \u201cfacilitat[e] the administration of claims . . . [ and] limit[ s] the scope of the\ngovernmental waiver of  sover eign im munity.\u201d T he Ni nth Circuit\u2019s decision in Marley and\nthe Supr eme Court \u2019s decision in Kubr ick support these points, respectively.\nCIf there is any his tory of t he controlling jurisdiction treating th e FT CA\u2019s  statute of\nlimitations as jurisdictional and/or not subject to equitable exceptions \u2013 going bac k to t he\npassage of  the statute \u2013 that history will  support continued treatment of the FT CA\u2019s\nstatute of limitations as jurisdictional and will suppo rt rebutting any pres umption in favor\nof equitable tolling. T he history of t he jurisdiction\u2019s treatment of the statute was  relied\nupon  in John R. S and & Grav el and Marley to show that the statute at issue was\njurisdictional and not subject to waiver or  tolling. \nCIf the controlling jurisdiction has ever h eld that the FT CA\u2019s  statute of limitations was\nsubject to equitable tolling, t he attorney shou ld determine whet her any dec ision did so\nbased on Irwin and if so, whet her it analyzed whet her the Irwin presumption of equitable\ntolling was r ebutted. If no decision analyzed wh ether the presumption wa s rebutted, recent\nSupr eme Court  decisions show t hat courts should perform thi s analysis t o determine\ncongress ional intent. \nCIf a decision in the controlling jurisdiction finds that equitable tolling is  appropriate and\nclaims to analyze whe ther the Irwin presumption wa s rebutted, the analysis is incomplet e.\nA complet e analysis o f the language, pu rposes, and legisl ative hi story of  the FT CA\u2019s\nstatute of limitations, consistent with similar analyses  of the Supreme Cou rt for other\nstatutes of limitations, wi ll show that Congres s did not intend for equitable tolling,\nthereby rebu tting th e Irwin presumption. T his will include:\nCThat the FT CA was enacted long bef ore the Irwin decision that established a\nrebuttable presumption in favor of  equitable tolling, but , as a relatively re cent\nwaiver of  sover eign im munity, is  purely stat utory and not an area in whic h\nequitable doctrines have t raditionally appl ied, like in habeas corpus or\nbankrupt cy;\nCThat the FT CA\u2019s  statute of limitations is emphatic, provid ing th at claims failing\nto meet its prescriptive per iods are \u201cforever ba rred;\u201d\nCThat the 2-y ear period for filing a c laim aft er accrual, coupled wi th the FTCA\u2019s\ndiscovery ru le of accrual, provides  ample t ime to f ile an administrative cla im\nwithout any nec essity for e quitable tolling;  \nCThat Congres s\u2019 inclusion of some types of  traditional equitable tolling in  another\nstatute of limitations for actions agains t the government, and its 1988 amendment\nof the FTCA to  include a specific equitable exception, s how t hat it did not intend\nto include other equitable tolling;   \nNOVEMBER 2010 UNITED STATES ATTORNEYS\u2019 BULLETIN 25\nCThat the FT CA, as  a wa iver-of- immunity statute with a statute of limitations that\nis an integral  part of its mandatory admini strative exha ustion requirement, was\nnot designed f or equitable tolling; a nd\nCThat the legisl ative hi story of  the FT CA sho ws that Congres s considered and\nrejected equitable tolling fo r the statute until it decided to provide a  specific type\nof equitable tolling in  a 1988 amendm ent. \nThe extent to whic h the government a ttorney shou ld develo p these argum ents will depend upon\nhow i mportant the equitable tolling is sue is to the case. In many  instances, such as wher e the court has\ntraditionally treated the FTCA\u2019s  statute of limitations as jurisdictional, a brief argument with citation to\nJohn R. S and & Grav el and Marley may be s ufficient. In other cases, such as whe re adver se prior\nprecedent exists, full devel opment o f the argum ent may be ne cessary.\nVII. Conclusion\nWhen a plaintiff raises equitable tolling as  a reason for excusing com pliance with either of the\nprescriptive pe riods of the FT CA\u2019s  statute of limitations, there is a very pers uasive legal a rgum ent that\nFTCA\u2019s  statute of limitations cannot be equitably to lled. That argument was strengthen ed considerably by\nthe Supr eme Court  in John R. S and & Grav el decision, wher e it considered the jurisdictional nature of a\nstatute of limitations for claims agains t the government. Beca use the FT CA\u2019s  statute, like the  statute at\nissue in John R. S and & Grav el, is correctly cons idered jurisdictional, any equit able tolling cou ld only be\njustified based upon strong evidence of congress ional intent for tolling. Her e, not only is s uch evide nce\nlacking, but  indicators of congress ional intent provide s ufficient eviden ce to overco me any pres umption of\nequitable tolling th at a court might en tertain.\u0098\nABOUT THE AUTHO R\n\u0091Adam  Bain is a Se nior Trial Coun sel in the Environ mental Torts Section of the Civil Di visio n.

Chee k\nTrial  Attorney\nTorts Branch, Ci vil Division\nI. Introduction\nThis article discusses an often overl ooked s tate law def ense in Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA)\ncases wher e the tort claim has languish ed wi th an agency for  a number of years  before suit is ultimately\nbrought. A c ase in point is Ande rson v. United States, No. 1 :08CV3, 20 10 W L 134 6409  (D. Md. Mar. 30,\n2010 ), appe al docketed, No. 1 0-1597  (4th Cir. June 1, 2010). The plaintiff, wh o had undergone su rgery in\n2002 , filed an admini strative tor t claim in 20 03 alleging m edical malpractice. Over the course of several\nyears , the agency negoti ated wi th Ms. Ande rson and eventua lly reac hed a tentative resolution. The\nAssistant Attorney Gener al, howe ver, r efused to approve the  propos ed settlement. M s. An derson then\nfiled suit in January 2008, o ver 5 year s after her injury occ urred.  \nMarylan d law, ho wever, h as an absolute 5-y ear period of repose on the filing of  medical\nmalpractice actions, calculated from the  date the injury was  comm itted. M D. CODE ANN., CTS. & JUD.\nPROC. \u00a7 5-109(a) (West, Westlaw through 2010 L egis. Sess.). A st atute of repose comprises a substantive\nright, i n favor of  a defendant, to be free from liability. A re pose period is fixed and not subject to tolling\nor estoppe l except in very limite d circumstances. The Un ited States filed a motion to dismiss, arguing tha t,\nas substantive st ate law, M aryland's sta tute of repose barred the action. The district court granted the\nmotion to dismiss. Ande rson, 201 0 WL 134 6409 , at *4.\nStatutes of repose are considered substantive sta te law. Thus, they m ay be r aised as a bar to FTCA\nsuits because the FTCA lo oks to  \"the law of  the place wher e the act or omissi on occurred\" to determine\nwhet her, und er the circumstan ces, \"the United States, if a private p erson, woul d be liable to the claimant\nin accordance with the law of the place wher e the act or omissi on occurred.\" 28 U.S .C. \u00a7 1 346(b) (2010).\nStated another way, the  FTCA m andates that the Un ited States shall be liable \"in the same m anner and to\nthe same extent as a private  individ ual under like cir cumstan ces. . . .\" Id. \u00a7 26 74 (2010 ). Ba sed on these\nconditions to the wa iver of sovere ign imm unity, it is well-settled that state substantive law a pplies in\nactions filed pursuant to the FTCA. FDIC v . Meyer, 510  U.S. 47 1, 47 8 (1994 ). \nIt therefore follows t hat statutes of repose, as substantive sta te law that defines whe n a cause of\naction no longer e xists, are applicable in FT CA act ions. To hold otherwise wou ld place the United States\nin a dramatic ally dif ferent position than private p arties, because a suit filed outside of the repose period\ncould proceed agai nst the Uni ted States while a similar suit filed agains t a private  person woul d be\ndismissed. Sec tion 2674 of the FTCA \u2013 al so known as the private  person analog \u2013 wa s intended to prevent\nsuch disparate results. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2674  (2010); cf. Hill v. Smi thKline Beecham Corp ., 393  F.3d  1111,\n1117  (10th Cir. 200 4).\nNOVEMBER 2010 UNITED STATES ATTORNEYS\u2019 BULLETIN 27\nII. Defining statutes of repose\nWhile the terms \"statute of repose\" and \"statute of limitations\" are often used interchangeably, t he\ntwo legal co ncepts are not identical. Indeed, the two concepts are separate and distinct legal t heories:\nIt is important to distinguish  statutes of limitations from sta tutes of repose at the outset of\nthis discussion. Al though the  comm encement da te for the applicable statute of limitations\nmay be de ferred and hinge up on the injured party's discovery of t he existence of the cause\nof action, the point of comm encement f or the applicable statute of repose is commonly the\ndate of the last act or omission that caused the plaintiff's injury.  M oreover, a  critical\ndistinction is that a repose period is fixed and its expiration wi ll not be delayed by\nestoppe l or tolling.\n4 Cha rles Alan Wright & Art hur R. M iller, Federal Practice and Pr ocedure \u00a7 1056  (3d ed. 200 2). \nCritically, cou rts have note d that \"[a] statute of limitations is procedural in nature while a statute of repose\nis substantive in that it defines a right ra ther than merely limits  its enforcement.\"  Resolution Tr ust Corp . v.\nOlson, 768  F.Sup p. 28 3, 28 5 (D. Ari z. 1991) ; see Alexander v. Beech Aircraft Corp ., 952  F.2d  1215, 12 23\n(10th Cir. 199 1); Goad v. Ce lotex Corp ., 831  F.2d  508, 511  (4th Cir. 198 7) (\"Statutes of repose are meant\nto be 'a subs tantive def inition of rights  as distingui shed from a pr ocedural limitation on the remedy  used to\nenforce rights .'\")\nIII. Analytical framework\nGiven t he frequent misinterpretation of statutes of repose as statutes of limitations, government\ncounsel must carefully anal yze an apparent statute of repose before raising it in an FTCA sui t. Statutes of\nrepose are principally char acterized b y at l east three factors. First and foremost, a statute of repose bars\nthe right to  bring a c ause of action after a statutorily-defined period of time has  passed. These statutes are\ntypic ally tied to the occurrence of an event,  such as the date of a medic al injury, an d are unrelated to the\ndate the claim accr ues or the injury is  discovered.  In other words, unlike st atutes of limitations, statutes of\nrepose do not incorporate the discovery ru le and the clock measuring the period of repose begins r unning\nregardl ess of whet her and when  the injury is  discoverabl e. Alexander, 952  F.2d  at 1218; Edmond s v.\nCytology Servs. of Md., Inc., 681  A.2d 5 46, 5 52 (Md. Ct. Spec. App . 199 6). \nSecond, statutes of repose are notoriously strict bars and are not subject to tolling or  estoppel\nunless specifically pro vided f or by sta tute. Hill v. Fitzgerald, 501  A.2d 2 7, 32  (Md. 19 85). This strict\ninterpretation of statutes of repose arises from the primary purp ose behind these statutes:  to curtail the\n\"long-tail\" effect of the discovery rul e. Id. at 32-33; Aben d v. Klaudt, 531  S.E.2 d 722, 72 6-27 (Ga. Ct .\nApp. 2 000). Therefore, a statute of repose aims to prevent i ndefinite expos ure to liability for  a particular\ninjury and  to afford defendants great er certainty in  predicting pot ential liability. Som e common statutory\nexceptions that permit a statute of repose to be tolled include fraudulent concealment o f a claim, claims\ninvol ving m inors, and injuries invol ving fore ign obj ects left in the body.

But  courts are gener ally not\npermitted to engraft  exceptions onto a statute of repose because doing so wou ld defeat the principal\npurpose behind the enactment. \nThird, un like a st atute of limitations, wh ich serves a s a procedural bar, a statute of repose is\nconsidered substantive in n ature. Statutes of repose completely eliminat e a cause of action for medical\nmalpractice after a certain time period. W hile a statute of limitations bars enforcement of  a cause of\naction, a statute of repose actually def ines whe n a cause of action no longer e xists. See Simmo ns v.\n28 UNITED STATES ATTORNEYS\u2019 BULLETIN NOVEMBER 2010\nSony ika, 614  S.E.2 d 27, 29 (Ga. 200 5) (\"The statute of repose destroys t he previousl y exis ting rights  so\nthat, on the expiration of the statutory per iod, the cause of action no longer e xists.\") (quotations omitt ed);\nResolution Tr ust Corp . v. Olson, 768  F.Sup p. 28 3, 28 5 (D. Ari z. 1991) .\nOppos ing cou nsel may  argue tha t an administrative tor t claim fil ed wi thin the statutorily-\nprescribed period satisfies a state statute of repose. Most statutes of repose, however,  require that a\nplaintiff file a civil action, not a claim, with in a certain time period. M oreover, t he administrative tor t\nclaim operates like an  insurance claim in a private c ontext in that when  a medic al provider  causes an\ninjury, a p atient submits a claim to that medical provider \u2019s malpractice insurance carrier before filing sui t.\nAfter filing such  a claim, the injured party and t he insurance company m ay engage in s ettlement\ndiscussions. Dur ing th is time, a patient must take car e to satisfy all applicable state law requirements,\nincluding th e filing of  a civil action wi thin a statute of repose, in order to maintain a cause of action. Cf.\nHenr y Prods. Co. v . Uni ted States, 180  Ct. Cl. 9 28, 9 30 (1967 ) (\"[V]oluntary sett lement negota tions [sic]\nhave no  effect on the running of t he statute of limitations once it has begun.\" ). Likewis e, just as in a\nprivate c ontext, plaintiffs' counsel in FT CA act ions must p ay clo se attention to a statute of repose in order\nto properly pre serve a ca use of action.\nAn ar gument that the submissi on of an administrative tor t claim sat isfies a state statute of repose\nalso fails to appreciate that \"there is nothing to pr event a plaintiff from complying wit h both\nrequirements.\" Stanley v. Uni ted States, 321  F.Sup p. 2d  805, 809  (N.D. W. Va. 2004). A judicial finding\nthat the filing of  an adminis trative tort claim satisfies a statute of repose wou ld create an implied\nexception to the bar, something that  is strictly pro hibited. In Ande rson, for example, settlement\nnegoti ations lasted for years , and the plaintiff filed her suit outside of the period of repose. Simila r\nlitigatio n agai nst a private d efendant woul d be dismisse d in state court, as well as in a federal court\npresiding over a divers ity acti on. Co nsequently, a rul ing th at the submissi on of an administrative tor t\nclaim stops the repose clock fr om ticking would  cause a result that the private  person analogue wa s\nintended to prevent.\nAgency couns el may be c oncerned that the statute of repose argum ent may prompt c laimants  to\nfile suit earlier, although the  parties' sett lement talks ar e progress ing wel l. It is  well-known th at, onc e a\ncomplai nt is filed, the U.S . Attorney's Office takes pr imary res pons ibility for  a case. But  agency cou nsel\nmay rai se a statute of repose as levera ge duri ng negoti ations with a claimant. T his defense has the\npractical effect of preventi ng prol onged ne gotia tions. In addition to bringin g sett lement talks to a quicker\nresolution in many  instances, statutes of repose may  also be used to obtain a more r easonable resolution.\nIV. Conclusion\nTo date, nearly two-thir ds of the states have est ablished statutes of repose for medical malpractice\nactions. Ye t, aside from Ande rson, only a coup le of decisions discuss statutes of repose in any type of\nFTCA sui t. See, e.g., Vega  v. Un ited States, 512  F.Sup p. 2d  853 (W.D. T ex. 2007 ) (dismissing FT CA\nclaim for negligent  design as  barred by T exas\u2019s real property stat ute of repose); Manion v. United States,\nNo. CV -06-739, 2006 WL 299 0381  (D. Or. Oc t. 18, 20 06) (dismissing FT CA sui t as filed outside of\nOregon's statute of ultimate repose). Since Ande rson, this defense has been raised in a number of FTCA\nactions, and the develop ment of a solid body of c aselaw is underway. \u0098  \nNOVEMBER 2010 UNITED STATES ATTORNEYS\u2019 BULLETIN 29\nABOUT THE AUTHO R\n\u0091Jason R.

Introduction\nIn federal tort actions, the Uni ted States, as a defendant or an individu al federal defendant, may\nchallenge t he venu e in whi ch the plaintiff has filed the action if the venue  is either not proper under a\nfederal venue s tatute or not the most s uitable venue  for the case. A de fendant in a federal tort case may\nwish to challenge the  plaintiff\u2019s choice of venue f or sever al reasons. For example, the plaintiff may have\nchosen a venue  in which the controlling law i s more f avorab le to the plaintiff than in other appropriate\nvenues , the plaintiff may have cho sen a venue  that is less convenien t for the defense of the action than\nother appropriate venue s, or the plaintiff may  have c hosen a legally imprope r venue  that woul d subject the\naction to dismissa l or transfer to a legall y prope r venue .\nWhere a federal venue p rovis ion is part of a statute that waives th e government\u2019 s soverei gn\nimmunity, th e question arises whet her the defendant can waive a venue objection. Gene rally, the\ngovernment cannot waive jurisdictional conditions on the wai ver of  sover eign im munity. Congres s,\nhowever , may have in tended a statutory venue provisi on not to be a condition on a  sover eign im munity\nwaiver but  rather a privilege th at the defendant can choose to invoke or waive. For example, whi le the\nSupr eme Court  has not determined whe ther the venu e provisi on for the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA)\nis a condition on the Ac t\u2019s waiver of sovere ign imm unity, th e legisl ative hi story of  the Act  supports the\nview th at the FT CA\u2019s  venue p rovis ion is not a jurisdictional condition but a privilege t hat the Uni ted\nStates can either invoke or waive.     \nVenue may  be signifi cant to the outcome of a case. A recent case illustrates a situation in whi ch\nchallenging an i mproper venue u ltimatel y assi sted in the dismissal of a multi -billion dollar federal tort suit\nagains t the Un ited States. In Sanc hez v. Un ited States, 600  F.Sup p. 2d  19, 20-21 (D.D.C. 20 09), 7,125\nplaintiffs brought a n FT CA la wsui t agains t the Un ited States in whi ch they ass erted that the Uni ted States\nhad engaged i n negligent and wrongful  acts and omissi ons with respect to its operation of a mili tary\ntraining faci lity on t he Islan d of Vieques in Pue rto Rico. The plaintiffs filed the suit in the district court\nfor the District of Columbia. A factor in the plaintiffs\u2019 choice of venue may have been  rulings fr om the\nFirst Circuit Court of Appe als and the Di strict of Puerto Rico, whic h found  that the FT CA\u2019s  discretionary\nfunction exception, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2680 (a), barred a similar suit. See Abreu v. Uni ted States, 468  F.3d  20 (1st\nCir. 200 6), aff'g Rivera-Acevedo v. Uni ted States, Nos . 04-1232, 04 -1372 , 200 5 WL 561 0230  (D.P .R. Apr .\n30 UNITED STATES ATTORNEYS\u2019 BULLETIN NOVEMBER 2010\n25, 2 005). The Un ited States mov ed to dismiss o r, in the alternative, t ransfer the case for improper venue.\nSanc hez, 600 F.Sup p. 2d  at 20. The court found  that venue i n the Di strict of Columbia was imprope r under\nthe FTCA bec ause (1) none  of the plaintiffs resided there, (2) the \u201cgravam en of the acts or omissi ons\ncomplai ned of\u201d occurred in Pue rto Rico, and (3) any rel evant conduct in the Di strict of Columbia\nproduced consequences only in Pue rto Rico. Id. at 22-23. T he court exercised its discretion under 28\nU.S.C. \u00a7 1406 (a) to transfer the case to Puerto Rico. Id. at 23-25. A year  later, the district court in the\nDistrict of Puerto Rico, relying in l arge par t on the First Circuit\u2019s holding in Abre u, dismisse d the case\nbased upon the FTCA\u2019s  discretionary funct ion exception. Sanc hez v. Un ited States, 201 0 WL 162 6118 , at\n*1 (D.P.R. M ar. 31, 2010). Thus, challenging v enue in the Di strict of Columbia ultimately faci litated the\ndismissal of the case based upon controlling pr ecedent in the transferee district.\nThis article will cover  the main t opics with whi ch a government lawyer ne eds to be familiar in\naddressing venue for federal tort actions:  (1) the statutory pro visio ns that determine venue, (2) the\nprocedures for challenging venue, ( 3) issues that often arise whe n venue  is challenged, a nd (4) whet her\nthe government can wai ve an ob jection to an inappropriate venue. \nII. Provisions governing venue for federal tort actions\nMost federal tort actions arise under the FT CA, 28 U. S.C. \u00a7\u00a7  1346(b), 2671-2680. W ith respect to\nvenue f or an FTCA act ion, federal law states, \"[a]ny civil  action on a tort claim ag ainst the Uni ted States\nunde r subsection (b) of section 1346 of this title may  be prosecuted only in the judicial district wher e the\nplaintiff resides or wher ein the act or omissi on complained of occurred.\" 28 U.S .C. \u00a7 1 402(b) (2010).\nIn addition to the FT CA, two  statutes provide f or admira lty suit s, including tor t actions, agains t\nthe United States. These two st atutes, wh ich predate the FT CA, ar e the Public Vessels Act (PVA), 4 6\nU.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7  31101-3111 3 (2009 ) and the Suits in Admira lty Act ( SAA), 4 6 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 30901 -3091 8 (2009 ).\nThe PVA aut horizes \u201c[a] civil action in personam in ad miralty . . . a gains t the Un ited States . . . for\ndamag es caused by a pub lic vess el of the Uni ted States.\u201d 46 U.S.C. \u00a7  31102 (2009 ). The SAA is\nsomewhat  broader since it renders the Uni ted States liable in admiralty in any cas e \u201cin whic h, if a vesse l\nwere private ly owned  or operated, or if cargo wer e private ly owned  or possessed, or if a private p erson or\nproperty were  involved, a c ivil action in admiralty coul d be maintained . . . .\u201d 46 U.S. C. \u00a7 3 0903 (a)\n(2009). See also Tagha domi  v. Un ited States, 401  F.3d  1080, 10 83 (9th Cir. 200 5) (discussing\napplicability of PV A and  SAA). Togethe r, the two ac ts provide t he exclusive caus e of action for damag es\nsuffered aboard a public vesse l due to negligence  comm itted by the  United States or its agents . See Doyl e\nv. Be thlehem Steel Corp ., 504  F.2d  911, 912  (5th Cir. 197 4) (holding that  action agains t government u nder\nPVA and  SAA was  the exclusive remedy for worker  injured whi le working aboar d tanker owned  by the\nUnited States). Onl y the SAA, however , woul d apply in  an admira lty acti on agains t the Un ited States not\ninvol ving a publ ic vesse l. See Peter Myer 's article entitled The United States\u2019 Waivers of Sovereign\nImmun ity in Admi ralty, found in the next issue of the Uni ted States Attorneys\u2019 Bu lletin.\nThe two ad miralty statutes contain similar, but somewhat  distinct, venu e provisi ons. The PVA\u2019s\nvenue p rovis ion states:\n(a) In general. A civil action under this chapter shall be brought i n the district\ncourt of the Uni ted States for the district in which the vess el or cargo is  found\nwithin the Uni ted States.\n(b) Vess el or cargo outside territorial waters.

A ci vil action under this chapter shall be brought i n the district\ncourt of the Uni ted States for the district in which \u2013 \n(1) any pl aintiff resides or has its principal place of business; or \n(2) the vess el or cargo is  found. \n(b) Trans fer. On a motion by a par ty, th e court may  transfer the action to any ot her\ndistrict court of the Un ited States.\n46 U.S. C. \u00a7 3 0906  (2009).   \nFinally, a f ederal tort action may  take the  form of a personal liability claim asserted agai nst a fed-\neral employee i n that employee\u2019 s individual  capacity. Th e most c ommon type of personal liability claims\nare premised upon  an alleged viola tion of the Co nstitution as recognized by the  Supr eme Court  in Bivens\nv. Six Unkn own Name d Age nts of Fed. Bur eau of Narc otics, 403  U.S. 38 8 (1971 ). See generally, Paul\nMichael Brown, Personal Liability Tort Litigation Ag ainst Federal Emp loyees, in this issue of the Uni ted\nStates Attorneys'  Bulletin. These claims are  known as  Bivens actions or Cons titutional torts, and venue  is\ncontrolled by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1391 (b), whi ch provid es:\nA civil action wher ein jurisdiction is not found solely on diver sity of citizenshi p\nmay, exc ept as otherwise provided  by law, be brought onl y in ( 1) a judicial\ndistrict where any defe ndant resides, if all defendants reside in the same Stat e, (2)\na judicial district in which a substantial part of the events  or omissi ons giving ris e\nto the claim occurred, or a substantial part of property tha t is the subject of the\naction is situated, or (3) a judicial district in which any defe ndant may be f ound ,\nif there is no district in which the action may othe rwise be brought.\nSignif icantly, th e Supreme Cou rt has held the federal officer venue p rovis ion, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\n1391 (e), does not apply to these actions because that provis ion only appli es to suits brought a gains t\ngovernment officials in their official capacities; venue  for constitutional torts, wh ich are brought a gains t\ngovernment officials in their individual capacities, is controlled exclusively by  \u00a7 13 91(b). Stafford v.\nBriggs, 444  U.S. 52 7, 54 4-45 (1980 ). Ad ditionally, bec ause tort suits brought a gains t individual\ngovernment employees for conduct within the scope of their employment can only be b rought again st the\nUnited States under the FT CA, see 28 U.S. C. \u00a7 2 679, the FTCA venue s tatute establishes venue f or those\nactions.  \n32 UNITED STATES ATTORNEYS\u2019 BULLETIN NOVEMBER 2010\nIII. Procedures for challenging venue in federal tort cases\nA. Challengin g venue wh en the case  is filed in  a district lacking venue\nWhen a plaintiff has filed a case in a district lacking venue o ver the action, the defendant may\nmove to dismiss the action and/or transfer the action to a court with proper venue. The venu e statute\nspecifically pro vides  for a remedy when venue i s improper. It states that \u201c[t]he district court of a district in\nwhic h is filed a case laying v enue in the wr ong divis ion or district shall dismiss, or if it be in the interest\nof justice, transfer such case to any dis trict or division in whi ch it could have been  brought.\u201d  28 U.S .C.    \n\u00a7 1406(a) (2010). As o riginal ly ena cted in 1948, this provisi on \u201cprovided f latly that  the district court\n\u2018shall transfer\u2019 a case filed in an imprope r venue ;\u201d there was  no a lternative remedy  of dismissa l. See 14D\nCHARLES A. WRIGHT, ARTHUR R. MILLER & EDWARD H. COOPER, FEDERAL PRACTICE AND PROCEDURE  \n\u00a7 3827, a t 565 (3d ed. 20 07) (citing Act  of May 24, 194 9, c. 139 , \u00a7 81, 63  Stat. 101). In 1949, s hortly after\nenactment, howe ver, Con gress  changed Sec tion 1406(a) to provide t hat wher e venue  was imprope r, the\ndistrict court \u201cshall dismiss\u201d  the case; the district court could only transfer the case to a court with proper\nvenue \u201c if it be in the interest of justice.\u201d See 14D W RIGHT, MILLER & COOPER, supra at 565. Congre ss\nrevised  the statute because it became cle ar that a provis ion requiring tra nsfer was unacceptable. As a\nSena te Repo rt on the amendment explained: \nIt is thought that this provisi on may  be subject to abuse in that a plaintiff might\ndeliberately bri ng a sui t in the wr ong divis ion or district wher e he could get\nservice o n the defendant, and whe n the question of venue  is raised the court is\nrequired to transfer the case to the court where it \u201ccould have be en brought.\u201d\nHowever, in the meantime, service h as been perfected on a defendant in the\nwron g venue, and it will carry over into the new ( and proper) venue. Rather than\npromote justice, it can be seen that this section may be s ubject to abuse. \nS. REP. No. 8 1-303, at 1253 (1949 ). The Supreme Court  subsequently elab orated that the purpose of\nallowing tra nsfer in some ci rcumstances, rather than dismissa l, wa s to avoid  \u201cthe injustice whi ch had often\nresulted to plaintiffs from dis missal of their actions merel y becau se they had made an  erroneous guess\nwith regard to the existence of some el usive fac t of the kind  upon whi ch venu e provisi ons often turn.\u201d\nGold lawr, Inc. v. Hei man, 369  U.S. 46 3, 46 6 (1962 ).\nUnder  Rule 12(b)(3) of the Federal Rules of Civil  Procedure, a defendant may m ove to dismiss a\nplaintiff\u2019s complaint for improper venue i n lieu of filing an an swer . When a defendant challenges venu e,\nthe plaintiff bears the burden of establishing that  venue i s proper, \u201c[b]ecause it is the plaintiff\u2019s obligation\nto institute the action in a permissible forum.\u201d  Freeman v. Fa llin, 254  F.Sup p. 2d  52, 56 (D.D.C. 20 03). \nAs a gener al matter, however,  courts favor t he transfer of a case for improper venue o ver di smissa l. See\nGold lawr, 369  U.S. a t 466-67; Sanc hez v. Uni ted States, 600  F.Sup p. 2d  19, 22 (D. D.C. 20 09). Yet ,\ncourts have prop erly exe rcised their discretion to dismiss a  case rather than transfer it in situations in\nwhic h a plaintiff had not simply m ade a good f aith error regardi ng venue. \nFor example, wher e it appeared that a plaintiff\u2019s choice of a district without proper venue  was\nmotivated by the desire to shop for a more f avorab le forum, rat her than a good fa ith mista ke as t o venue ,\ncourts have exer cised their discretion to dismiss a  case. In Mikkilineni v. Pen nsylvania, No. 0 2-1205 , 200 3\nWL 2185 4754 , at *8 (D.D.C. Aug. 5, 20 03) aff\u2019d, No. 0 3-5329  (D.C. Cir. Nov. 22, 2 004) (per curiam), a\ncourt exercised its discretion to dismiss a  case unde r Section 1406(a), noting that  the plaintiff, \u201choping to\nfind a more sym pathetic judge,\u201d d id not seek to h ave hi s case transferred to a district court with proper\nvenue i n Pennsylvania and filed his case in the District of Columbia.  Id. Acco rdingly, the court found that\ntransferring th e case to Pennsylvani a wou ld not be in the interest of justice. Id. See also Vanskiver v.\nNOVEMBER 2010 UNITED STATES ATTORNEYS\u2019 BULLETIN 33\nRoso tti, No. 0 0-2455 , 200 1 WL 361 470, at *2 (D.D.C. J an. 31, 2 001) (dismissing a ca se for imprope r\nvenue a nd noting that  the reason the plaintiffs filed in the Di strict of Columbia rather than in the District\nof Kansas, wher e venue  was proper, may have been  that the District of Kansas had enjoined the plaintiffs\nfrom filing any sui t agains t the Un ited States in that district without leave of  the court). \nIt may  also be a proper exercise of discretion to dismiss a  case, rather than transfer it to another\ncourt, when  there is a substantial question regardi ng the substantive m erits of a claim. For e xample, in\nNaar tex Con sulting Co rp. v. Watt , 722  F.2d  779, 789  (D.C. Cir. 198 3), the District of Columbia Circuit\nCour t held that a district court did not abuse its discretion in dismissi ng an ac tion whe re there wer e\nsubstantive pr oblems with  the plaintiff\u2019s claims such that the plaintiff could not show that those claims\ncould properly be h eard in any fede ral court. See also Bartel v. Fed. Aviation Ad min., 617  F.Sup p. 19 0,\n199 (D.D.C. 1985 ) (finding that  dismissa l was an appropriate remedy  rather than transfer where there was\na signif icant question regardi ng wheth er the plaintiff stated a valid FT CA cl aim). Compar e 14D W RIGHT,\nMILLER & COOPER, supra at 567 (stating that  a district court may  not order transfer if it does not have\nsubject matter jurisdiction unless transfer would cure the jurisdictional defect), with Bartel, supra. \nOn the other hand, courts will usually transfer a case, rather than dismiss i t, wh en the plaintiff\ncould not refile the action because the applicable statute of limitations had expired. See Sinclair v.\nKleindienst, 711  F.2d  291, 293 -94 (D.C. Cir . 198 3) (stating that  transfer may  be appropriate whe n a\nprocedural obstacle such as the statute of limitations impedes an adjudication on the meri ts); Simp son v.\nFed. Bureau of Prisons, 496  F.Sup p. 2d  187, 194  (D.D.C.  2007) (same). T he dismissal of an action for\nimprope r venue  when  the statute of limitations has expired, ho wever, i s not itself an abuse of discretion. \nCont \u2019l Ins. Co . v. M/V Ors ula, 354  F.3d  603, 608  (7th Cir. 200 3) (\u201c[D]ismissal of a cause of action for\nimprope r venue  under 28 U.S .C. \u00a7 1 406(a) after the statute of limitations has run does not, on its own ,\nconstitute an abuse of discretion.\u201d). Indeed, some cou rts have foun d that filing a ca se in a court of\nimprope r venue  shortly bef ore the statute of limitations expires may  justify dismissa l. See, e.g., \nPedz ewick v. Fo e, 963  F.Sup p. 48 , 51-52 (D. M ass. 199 7) (dismissi ng a ca se for imprope r venue , rather\nthan transferring it,  even t hough t he statute of limitations had expired on any subse quent action, because\nplaintiff had failed to exercise proper diligence a nd act in good fa ith in deciding where  to file suit).

Unde r the SAA, venue i s\n34 UNITED STATES ATTORNEYS\u2019 BULLETIN NOVEMBER 2010\nappropriate whe re the plaintiff resides, wher e the plaintiff has its principal place of business, or wher e the\nvessel  or cargo is  found. 46 U.S .C. \u00a7 3 0906 (a) (2009 ).  \nCongres s enacted 28 U.S.C. \u00a7  1404(a) to permit c hange of venue  between  federal courts with\nproper venue. The statute was  drafted in accordance with the common law do ctrine of forum non\nconveniens, whi ch allowed for dismissa l of cases that were filed in completely ina ppropriate or\ninconveni ent venues , see Piper Aircraft Co. v  Reyno, 454  U.S. 23 5, 25 3 (1981 ) (citing Reviser \u2019s Note,\nH.R. Rep . No. 8 0-308, at A132 (1947); see H.R. Rep . No. 7 9-2646 , at A127 (1946)); but it was intended\nas \u201ca revisio n rather than a codification of the common law.\u201d Piper Aircraft, 454  U.S. a t 253 (citing\nNorwo od v. Kirkpatrick, 349  U.S. 29  (1955)). District courts have m ore discretion to transfer a case for\nreasons of inconvenie nce under Section 1404(a) than they had  to dismiss a  case on those groun ds under\nthe doctrine of forum non  conveniens. See Norwo od, 349  U.S. a t 31-32. S ection 1404(a) states that \u201c[f]or\nthe convenien ce of parties and witnesses, in the interest of justice, a district court may transfer any civil\naction to any ot her district or divisio n whe re it might h ave bee n brought.\u201d  28 U.S .C. \u00a7 1 404(a) (2010). \nTypical ly, if  the plaintiff has chosen an appropriate forum under the applicable venue  statute,\nthere is a strong pre sumpti on in favor of  the plaintiff\u2019s choice of venue. See Piper Aircraft, 454  U.S. a t\n255-56; Mathis v. Geo Grou p, Inc., 535  F.Sup p. 2d  83, 86-87 (D.D.C. 20 08). Therefore, the burden of\nproof rests on the defendant to show that transfer is appropriate. See Deck er Coal  Co. v . Common weal th\nEdison Co., 805  F.2d  834, 843  (9th Cir. 198 6) (\u201cThe defendant must make a s trong showi ng of\ninconveni ence to war rant upsetting the plaintiff\u2019s choice of forum.\u201d) First, the defendant must establish\nthat venue  is proper in the proposed transferee district. See Hoffman  v. Blaski, 363  U.S. 33 5, 34 3-44\n(1960); Sierra Club v. Flowers , 276  F.Sup p. 2d  62, 65 (D.D.C. 20 03). Sec ond, the defendant must\ndemonst rate that interests of justice and considerations of convenien ce weigh in f avor of  transfer to that\ncourt. In mak ing th is latter determination, c ourts will weigh ca se-speci fic private  and public interest\nfactors. See Piper Aircraft, 454  U.S. a t 241. \nThe private i nterest factors may inc lude: \n(1) the plaintiff\u2019s choice of forum, unl ess the balance of convenien ce is strongly in favor\nof the defendants; (2) the defendants\u2019 choice of forum; (3 ) whether the claim aros e\nelsewh ere; (4) the conveni ence of the parties; (5) the conveni ence of the witnesses of the\nplaintiff and defendant, but only to t he extent that the wi tnesses may  actually be\nunavaila ble for trial in one of the fora; and (6) the ease of access to sources of proof. \nTrou t Unlimited v. U.S. De pt. of Agric., 944  F.Sup p. 13 , 16 (D.D.C. 1996 ) (footnotes omitt ed).  \nThe public interest factors may inc lude: \n(1) the transferee's famili arity with t he governi ng laws ; (2) the relative congest ion of the\ncalendars of the potential transferee and transferor courts; and (3) the local interest in\ndeciding loca l controver sies at home. \nId. (footnotes omitted). \nIn a federal tort case, a federal defendant most typic ally wil l consider seeking a c hange of venue\nbased upon the ease to access of sources of proof, including the ability to use compuls ory pr ocess for the\nattendance of unwi lling wit nesses at trial. See 1 LESTER S. JAYSON & ROBERT C. LONGSTRETH, HANDLING\nFEDERAL TORT CLAIMS \u00a7 7.0 3[2], at 7-26 (2009 ). There may  also be cases in whi ch it is important for the\nfact finder to view l ocations that are central to the issues in the case. See id. Finally, it is not uncommon to\nseek transfer of a case involving com mon issues of fact with a case in another district for purposes of\nconsolidation to avoid  duplication of trial efforts. See id.\nNOVEMBER 2010 UNITED STATES ATTORNEYS\u2019 BULLETIN 35\nIV. Recurring venue issues in federal tort cases\nA. Can there  be m ore t han on e venue for an FTCA  case based upon  the phrase \"w herein the\nact or  omission  com plain ed of occurre d\"?\nVenue may  lie in more t han one district under the FT CA. I nitially, by  virtue of the first clause of\nthe FTCA\u2019s  venue s tatute, venue  woul d be proper in more t han one district if the plaintiff lives in  a\ndifferent district from the  place wher e the act or omissi on occurred. In a multi-plaintiff action, venue\nwoul d be proper in more t han one district based solely on t he different districts of the plaintiffs\u2019\nresidences. Unde r the second clause of the FT CA\u2019s  venue s tatute, however,  \u201cit has so far been held that\nthe act or omission complained of can occur in only one di strict.\u201d 14D W RIGHT, MILLER & COOPER, supra\n\u00a7 3814, a t 365. See Andr ade v. Ch ojnacki, 934  F.Sup p. 81 7, 82 9 (S.D. T ex. 1996 ) (stating th at the\noperative lan guag e in Section 1402(b) suggests that venue i n FT CA act ions premised on \u201cwher ein the act\nor omission complained of occurred\u201d is \u201cproper in only one district\u201d). This interpretation is supported by\nthe plain meanin g of t he statute whi ch confines venue  to \u201cthe judicial district . . . wh erein the act or\nomission complained of occurred.\u201d 28 U.S .C. \u00a7 1 402(b) (2010) (emphasis added).

Uni ted States, 591  F.Sup p. 37 4, 37 7-78 (D.D.C. 19 84), a Di strict of Columbia district\ncourt impli ed that venue f or a case may be a ppropriate in more that one district based upon the second\nclause of 28 U.S .C. \u00a7 1 402(b). Finding that  venue wa s appropriate in the District of Columbia, the court\nreasoned that 28 U.S .C. \u00a7 1 402(b) should be given a \u201cliberal construction\u201d like the gene ral venue  statute,\n28 U.S. C. \u00a7 1 391(b), so that venue  woul d lie \u201cin a district where a substantial portion of the acts or\nomissions giving ris e to the [court] actions occurred, no twithstanding that  venue might al so lie in other\ndistricts.\u201d 591 F. Supp . at 378 (quoting Lamont  v. Ha ig, 590  F.2d  1124, 11 34 (D.C. Cir . 197 8) (emphasis\nadded in Fran z)). The problem with the Fran z court\u2019s analysis is that, unlike 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1391 (b) (the\nprovisio n at issue in the quoted Lamont  case), the terms of the FT CA, in cluding its  venue p rovis ion, must\nbe strictly construed. In Reub er v. Uni ted States, the District of Columbia Circuit noted that the FT CA\u2019s\nvenue p rovis ion should be strictly cons trued and stated that \u201cCon gress  has specified the district in whi ch\nthe act occurred as the \u2018only\u2019 district, other than that wher e the plaintiff resides, wher e a claim may be\nbrought.\u201d Reub er, 750  F.2d  1039, 10 48 (D.C. Cir . 198 4) (emphasis added), overruled on other grounds  by\nKauf fman  v. Anglo-American Sch. of Sofia, 28 F.3d 1223  (D.C. Cir. 199 4). \nB. Und er the FTCA, wh ere is the district where \"the act  or om ission  com plain ed of\noccurr ed\" f or m ulti-dis trict torts?\nIf there can only be one appropriate venue  wher e the alleged \u201ca ct or omissi on complained of\noccurred\u201d under the FT CA\u2019s  venue s tatute, one must someti mes determine the appropriate venue wh ere\nthe wrongful  conduct allegedly occ urred in multi ple districts and/or wher e the alleged ha rmful e ffect took\nplace in a different district from the allegedly wro ngful  conduct.\nIn Andr ade v. Ch ojnacki, 934  F.Sup p. 81 7, 82 3 (S.D.

Id. at 829. Even t hough W aco was in the Western\nDistrict of Texas, the plaintiffs argued th at venue f or the FTCA cl aims was also appropriate in the\nSouthern District because \u201ca substantial part of the acts or omissi ons complai ned of occurred in Hous ton.\u201d\n36 UNITED STATES ATTORNEYS\u2019 BULLETIN NOVEMBER 2010\nId. at 829. The court determined that a \u201cprepond erance of the contacts test\u201d governed  the application of\nthe statute\u2019s language tha t states, \u201cwher ein the act or omissi on complained of occurred.\u201d Id. at 829 (citing\nJohns-Manville Cor p. v.

When is venu e for federal tort  actions proper in the Distric t of Columbia?\nPlaintiffs will often bring fede ral tort actions again st the Uni ted States government or federal\nofficials in the District of Columbia, whi ch is perceived to be the location of the federal government.\nVenue, however,  may or may  not be appropriate in the Di strict of Columbia, depending upon t he\napplicable venue s tatute. Be cause of the possibility that  venue f or federal tort actions may be i mproper in\nthe District of Columbia,  federal courts in the Di strict \u201cmust e xamine c hallenges t o venue  particularly\ncarefully \u2018to guard a gains t the danger that a plaintiff might manuf acture venue i n the Di strict of\nColu mbia.\u2019 \u201c Sierra Club v.

For example, in Zakiya v. Uni ted States, 267  F.Sup p. 2d  47 (D.D.C. 20 03), a federal\nprisoner brought a n FT CA act ion that challenged a  Bureau of Prisons (BOP) p olicy of d etaining inm ates\nbeyond t heir judicially-imposed  sentences whe n there was  a failure to meet c ourt-imposed  financial\nobligations. Id. at 49, 58. T he court found  that the plaintiff\u2019s allegatio ns could not establish venue  in the\nDistrict of Columbia unde r the FTCA\u2019s  venue s tatute, even if  the policy upon whic h the BOP agents  based\ntheir decision to detain the plaintiff was formulat ed in the district.

The court concluded that the \u201cplaintiff\u2019s challenge of the BOP pol icy is\na specific attack on t he implementation of that policy to hi s particular situation, and as the actual\nimplementa tion by the BOP officials occurred at the facilities wher e he was incarcerated and not in this\ndistrict, venu e is not appropriate here.\u201d Id. at 59.

The Ni nth Circuit, applying the \u201c headqua rters\ndoctrine,\u201d found  that the plaintiff\u2019s suit was not barred by the  FTCA\u2019s  foreign cou ntry excep tion for a\n\u201cclaim arising in  a foreign cou ntry,\u201d 28 U.S.C.  \u00a7 26 80(k), bec ause the plaintiff\u2019s arrest resulted from\n\u201cwrongful  acts of planning and  direction\u201d by DEA of ficials in the Un ited States. See 542 U.S. at  702. The\nSupr eme Court  reverse d the Ni nth Circuit, noting that  many tor t claims can  be \u201crepackaged as\nheadqua rters claims bas ed on a failure to train, a failure to warn, the offering of  bad advic e, or the\nadoption of a negli gent po licy.\u201d Id. at 702-03. T he Co urt reasoned that allowing head quarters claims\nwoul d mak e the claim a st andard part of FTCA pl eading fo r any act ion potentially implicating th e foreign\ncountry excep tion.

Moreover, i n its rejection of the headquarters doctrine, the Cou rt found that\nCongres s likely in tended the foreign cou ntry excep tion to reserve so verei gn im munity for  any cl aim for\ninjury or  harm occurring in  a foreign cou ntry. Id. at 704-05. S imila rly, with respect to the FTCA\u2019s  venue\nprovisio n, Con gress  likely int ended to limit venue  under the FT CA to  a district in whi ch a plaintiff resides\nor the district most closely ass ociated wi th the occurrence of the alleged ne gligent act or omissi on. If\n\u201cheadquarters claims\u201d were sufficient to establish venue  in the District of Columbia, plaintiffs wou ld\nroutinely asse rt a \u201cheadqua rters claim\u201d in F TCA cas es any ti me they want ed to establish venu e in that\ndistrict.\n38 UNITED STATES ATTORNEYS\u2019 BULLETIN NOVEMBER 2010\nFurther, a plaintiff cannot establish venu e in the Di strict of Columbia for a comm on law tort claim\nbased upon the \u201cresidence\u201d of a federal officer or employee un der Section 1391(e) of the federal venue\nstatute for torts that were committed within the scope of the federal employment. Even t hough \u201cr esidence\u201d\nfor this venue p rovis ion is considered the place wher e the person\u2019s official duties are performed (whic h\nwill often be the Di strict of Columbia for high-level federal employees) , rather than the employee\u2019s\npersonal residence, see Reuben H. Donn elley Cor p. v. Fed . Tra de Co mm\u2019n , 580  F.2d  264, 267  (7th Cir.\n1978 ), Section 1391(e) does not apply to such actions. Unde r the FTCA\u2019s  exclusive remedy  provisi on, a\ncomm on law tort claim comm itted within the scope of federal employm ent \u201cis an action agains t the Un ited\nStates rather than agains t the individual s or the particular government a gencie s.\u201d Cox v . Sec\u2019y of Labo r,\n739 F.Sup p. 28 , 29 (D.D.C. 1990 ) (citing case s). See also 28 U.S. C. \u00a7 2 679 (b)(1) (2010) (provid ing th at\nan FTCA act ion again st the Uni ted States is the exclusive remedy for alleged tor ts of federal employees\ncomm itted within the scope of federal employm ent); Zakiya v.

Therefore, Sec tion 1402(b), not Section 1391(e), determines  the\nappropriate venue  for such claims.\nNeither does Section 1391(e) apply to constitutional tort claims agains t federal employees. A\nconstitutional tort claim again st a federal officer is an individu al capacity suit , and venue  is controlled by\n28 U.S. C. \u00a7 1 391(b). Stafford v. Br iggs, 444  U.S. 52 7, 54 4 (1980 ). Therefore, a plaintiff  could only bri ng\na constitutional tort suit in the Di strict of Columbia when  venue i s appropriate under that provisi on.\nUnle ss all of the individual  defendants reside in the Di strict of Columbia, see 28 U.S .C. \u00a7 1 391(b)(1)\n(2010), venue is likely only pro per there whe n a \u201csubstantial part of the events  or omissi ons giving ris e to\nthe claim occurred\u201d there. See id. \u00a7 1391(b)(2) (2010). As wi th claims under the FT CA, m ere government\npolicy-making in t he Di strict of Columbia, without more, is unlikely to  provide a  basis for venue  in the\nDistrict of Columbia unde r this provisi on. F or example, in Ciralsky v. Ce ntral Intelligence Agen cy, 689\nF.Sup p. 2d  141, 145 -47 (D.D.C. 20 10), a plaintiff brought a c onstitutional tort action in the Di strict of\nColu mbia based upon the Cent ral Intel ligence Agenc y\u2019s (CIA) reinvest igation and revocat ion of the\nplaintiff\u2019s security clearance and his subsequent termination. T he court found  that venue wa s not proper in\nthe District of Columbia,  but rather in the Eastern District of Virginia , because \u201c[t]he overwhel ming bul k\nof events  and omissi ons giving ris e to [p]laintiff\u2019s claims occurred at CIA Head quarters in Langley,\nVirginia .\u201d Id. at 161. The plaintiff and seven of  the eight Bivens defendants wor ked at  the CIA\nheadqua rters; the headquarters was wher e the reinvest igation of the plaintiff\u2019s security clearance took\nplace; it was also the location of the decision to revok e his security clearance and terminate his\nemploym ent. Id. The court found  that the plaintiff\u2019s claims relating to  conduct in the Di strict of Columbia\nwere \u201cmore tangenti ally tha n substantially related to the claims in [the] case.\u201d Id. at 161.

The provis ion allowing venue whe re the cargo or vess el is\nfound rested on the concern that testimony  of witnesses on a  ship may  be lost by reas on of the nature of\ntheir employm ent, in particular the \u201crovin g manner of life of the ship\u2019s crew.\u201d See The Henr y S.

Whether federal tort venue provisions create a jurisdictional condition on the\ngovernment\u2019s waiver of sovereign immunity or a privilege which the United States\ncan assert or waive \nUnder  the Federal Rules of Civil  Procedure, venue is a defense whi ch must be asserted in a \nresponsive ple ading or by m otion. See FED. R. CIV. P. 12(b)(3). If the defense is not raised in one of these\ntwo ways, th e Rul es provide t hat it is waived. See FED. R. CIV. P. 12(h)(1). Cour ts, howe ver, co nsider\nmost terms of t he government\u2019 s waiver of sovere ign imm unity as jurisdictional conditions on the wai ver.\nSee United States v.

The Un ited States cannot assent to\njurisdiction in any in divid ual case wher e Con gress  has not specifically waived t he government\u2019 s immunity\nthrough le gisla tion; therefore, if a provis ion in a statute is a jurisdictional condition on the soverei gn\nimmunity waiver , the Uni ted States may not waive the  condition. See Uni ted States v.

For\nexample, with respect to the FT CA\u2019s  statute of limitations, courts have he ld that because the limita tions\nprovisio n is a condition of the Uni ted States\u2019 consent to suit, it is part of the wa iver of sovere ign imm unity\nthat defines the court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction. See, e.g., Rammi ng v. Uni ted States, 281  F.3d  158, 165\n(5th Cir. 2001) (stating, in a n FT CA cas e, that \u201c[l]imita tions periods in statutes waiving sovere ign\nimmunity are jurisdictional\u201d); Johnson v.

Cons equently, th e FT CA\u2019s  statute of limitations cannot be\nwaived by the United States, and the Un ited States can raise the limitations bar at any time. See Walters v.\nSec\u2019y of Def., 725  F.2d  107, 112  (D.C. Cir. 198 3). See generally Adam Bain, The Statute of Limi tations of\nthe Federal Tort Claims Act as a Jurisdictional Prerequisite to Suit and Implications for Equitable\nTolling, in this issue of the Uni ted States Attorneys' Bulletin.  \nCour ts, howe ver, ha ve not been consistent with respect to whet her the FT CA\u2019s  venue p rovis ion is\na condition on the wa iver of sovere ign imm unity tha t the Un ited States may  not waive or a  privilege th at\nthe United States is free to assert or waive. T wo ca ses within the District of Columbia Circuit suppo rt the\nargument that the FTCA\u2019s  venue p rovis ion is jurisdictional. See Reuber v. Un ited States, 750  F.2d  1039,\n1048 -49 (D.C. Cir . 199 4); Kimbe rlin v. Qui nlan, 774  F.Sup p. 1, 10 (D.D.C. 19 91). In Reub er, the District\nof Colu mbia Circuit stated that the FT CA\u2019s  venue s tatute, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1402(b), is one of the conditions of\nthe United States\u2019 waiver of  sover eign im munity to tort claims. 750 F.2d at 1048-49. Ul timately, the c ourt\nstated, it \u201cis unclear whet her a district court even has  jurisdiction to hear an FT CA cl aim anywher e but in\nthe district specified by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1402 (b)\u201d and concluded that it \u201cneed not decide this question\u201d\nbecause the dismissal of the plaintiff\u2019s FTCA cl aim was \u201cproperly withi n the district court\u2019s discretion.\u201d\nId. at 1049. In Kimbe rlin, a Di strict of Columbia district court stated that 28 U.S .C. \u00a7 1 402(b), as a part of\nthe FTCA\u2019s  waiver of  sover eign im munity, \u201cs pecifies precisely in whi ch courts venue i s proper,\u201d and the\n\u201cvenue  provisi on must t herefore be strictly cons trued.\u201d 774 F. Supp . at 10.\nOn the other hand, some courts have he ld that the FTCA\u2019s  specification of the appropriate venues\nin 28 U.S. C. \u00a7 1 402(b) can be waived. See Upch urch v. Piper Aircraft Corp ., 736  F.2d  439, 440  (8th Cir.\n1984 ); Bartlett v. Un ited States, 835  F.Sup p. 12 46, 1 262  (E.D. Wa sh. 1993 ); Nowot ny v. Tur ner, 203\nF.Sup p. 80 2, 80 5 (M.D. N.C. 196 2). In the only det ailed analysis o f the issue, the Upchu rch court found\nthat the Un ited States had wai ved any obj ection to venue b ecause it had failed to assert an objection to\nvenue i n its answer. 736  F.2d  at 440. The court explained that the FT CA\u2019s  current venue p rovis ion, 28\nU.S.C. \u00a7 1402 (b), was  formerly th e venue  provisi on of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 931(a) (1946  ed.), relating to  federal\ntort claims. Id. The court reasoned that when  Title 28 o f the Un ited States Cod e was  revised  in 1948, the\njurisdictional provisi ons of Section 931(a) were incorporated in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7  1346(b) in a Chap ter entitled\n\u201cDistrict Cour ts:  Jurisdiction\u201d and the venu e provisi ons of Section 931(a) were incorporated in Section\n1402 (b), in a Ch apter entitled \u201cDi strict Cour ts:  Venue.\u201d See id. (citing Act  of June 25, 1948 , ch. 646 , 62\nStat. 869, 9 33, 9 37). Bas ed upon this statutory re formulation, the court concluded that Congres s must n ot\nhave i ntended the FTCA\u2019s  venue p rovis ion to be a jurisdictional condition on the Un ited States\u2019 waiver of\nsovere ign imm unity. Id. The court also noted that other courts had construed the FTCA\u2019s  venue p rovis ion\nas a traditional \u201cvenue  statute,\u201d through whic h venue  could be wa ived, r ather than as a jurisdictional\ncondition. Id. (citing United States Lines, Inc. v. Uni ted States, 470  F.2d  487, 489  (5th Cir. 197 2) (per\ncuriam); United States v. Ac ord, 209  F.2d  709, 711 -14 (10th Cir. 1954); Nowot ny, 203  F.Sup p. at 805).\nThe Upchu rch decision, howe ver, do es not provide much s uppo rt for its conclusion because the\nreasoning does n ot withstand closer scrutiny. Initially, the c ourt\u2019s reasoning runs  counter to the purpose of\nthe 1948 revisi on of the Judicial Code , as reflected in the legisl ative hi story of  that revisio n. The 1948 Act\nthat revise d the Judicial Code  expressly stat ed that \u201c[n]o inference of a legisl ative co nstruction is to be\ndrawn by re ason of the chapter in Title 28, Judiciary and J udicial Procedure, as set out in section 1 of this\nAct, in which any sect ion is placed, no r by reas on of the catch-lines used in such title.\u201d Ac t of June 25,\n1948 , ch. 646 , \u00a7 33, 62  Stat. 991. T hus, the text of the statute that effected a recodification of Title 28,\nforbids the ver y infe rence that the Upchu rch court drew. \nIndeed, the Supr eme Court  has recently stat ed that it woul d not presume tha t the 1948 revisio n in\nthe Judicial Code  worked any cha nge in unde rlying subst antive law un less Congres s had clearly expr essed\nNOVEMBER 2010 UNITED STATES ATTORNEYS\u2019 BULLETIN 41\nan intent to make suc h a change.

Moreover, a s the Supreme Court  noted,\nthe legisla tive his tory of t he Ac t and the comments of the Chi ef Revise r both recognized t hat the 1948\nrevisio n sought t o codify, rat her than substantively revise , existing law. Id. at 136 (citing H.R. Rep . No.\n80-308, at 1-8 (1947 )); WILLIAM W. BARRON, THE JUDICIAL CODE: 1948  REVISION, 8 F.

Finally, fo llowin g the a nalysis o f the Upchu rch court to its logical  conclusion, the FTCA\u2019s  statute\nof limitations wou ld not be jurisdictional either. The FTCA\u2019s  limitations provisi on is not in the\n\u201cJurisdiction\u201d section of the Cod e, but in the \u201cUni ted States As A Pa rty Gener ally\u201d se ction. See 28 U.S .C.\n\u00a7 2401(b) (2010). \nNeither does the caselaw that the Upchu rch court cited provide much s uppo rt for its conclusion.\nOf the three cases on which Upchu rch relied, only the Nowot ny decision supports the conclusion that the\nFTCA\u2019s  venue p rovis ion is not jurisdictional and venue c an be wai ved, and  that case contains no a nalysis\nof the issue. Nowot ny, 203  F.Sup p. at 805. In United States Lines, Inc. v. Uni ted States, 470  F.2d  487, 489\n(5th Cir. 1972), the court merely struck the  United States\u2019 venue d efense, finding th at it was imprope r\nbecause the alleged ne gligent conduct had occurred wi thin a city in the district. The court did not discuss\nwhet her venue wa s a jurisdictional condition or a defense that could be wa ived. 4 70 F. 2d at 489. Acor d,\nthe other cited case, involved th e question of whet her a contribution action could be brought a gains t the\nUnited States in a venue o ther than those venues  appropriate under 28 U.S .C. \u00a7 1 402(b). 209 F.2d  at 711.\nThe court recognized th at the contribution claim again st the Uni ted States was an ancillary proce eding and\nthat \u201cno separate ground  of jurisdiction is required.\u201d Id. at 712. The court merel y suppor ted its holding by\nnoting th at venue p rovis ions were \u201cfor the convenien ce of the parties.\u201d Id. at 714.\nNevert heless, an analysis of what  Congres s intended through the  origina l venue  provisi on that\nbecame 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1402(b) shows that it must have meant  venue t o be a privilege i n FT CA act ions rather\nthan a jurisdictional condition. If one we re to decide the issue by th e original placement of the venue\nprovisio n alone, one  woul d have to c onclude that venue wa s intended to be jurisdictional. The venu e\nprovisio n, as enacted under the origina l version of the FTCA, was  contained in a section marked\n\u201cJurisdiction.\u201d The venu e provisi on of the tort claims act, enacted in the 79th Congres s, wa s contained\nwithin Section 410(a) [28 U.S.C. \u00a7 931(a) (1946  ed.)], whi ch contemporar y com mentator and Depa rtment\nof Justice \u201cClaims Divisi on\u201d attorney, I rvin Go ttlieb, described as the \u201cheart of the bill.\u201d See Irvin M .\nGottlieb, The Federal Tort Claims Act - A Statutory Interpretation, 35 GEO.

Id. \u00a7\u00a7 4 20, 4 21, 6 0 Stat. at 845. Of course, if the venu e\nprovisio n is \u201cjurisdictional\u201d merel y by virtue of its placement in the \u201cjurisdiction\u201d section of the statute,\nthen any change i n the location of the venu e provisi on, b y reas on of the 1948 Act, should not be given an y\ninterpretive weight f or the reasons articulated above, in cluding the very ter ms of that Act itself. See Act of\nJune 25, 1948 , ch. 646 , \u00a7 33, 62  Stat. 991.\nThe De partment o f Justice attorney, Irvin Go ttlieb, who wr ote an in-depth  interpretation of the\nAct upon its passage, n oted with respect to venue f or tort actions under the Act  that \u201c[a]n objection to\nvenue may  be raised by a m otion to dismiss, or imprope r venue  may be pl eaded in an answer.\u201d Got tleib,\nsupra at 17 n .51 (citing Duval  v. Bathrick, 31 F.Sup p. 51 0 (D. M inn. 194 0); Kauf man v . Uni ted States, 35\nF.Sup p. 90 0 (D.D.C. 19 40)). Go ttleib\u2019s statement mirrors the traditional notion of venue:   venue must be\nasserted by m otion to dismiss o r as a defense in the answe r; otherwise, any obj ection to venue wi ll be\nwaived. I ndeed, the Duval  decision, whi ch Go ttlieb cited, stated that \u201cthe rule is well settled that such\nprovisio ns governi ng the venue o f actions confer a personal privilege upo n the defendant which may be\nwaived.\u201d 31  F.Sup p. at 511. Go ttlieb also cited an Expl anatory Note t o the Federal Rules of Civil\nProcedure, stating th at imprope r venue  was an \u201caffirmati ve dil atory def ense.\u201d Gottleib, supra at 17 n .51\n(citing Expl anatory Note No.  3 to For m 2, Al legatio n of Jurisdiction, in Fed. R. Ci v. Pro.) . Got tlieb did\nnot discuss whet her venue f or an FTCA act ion was a jurisdictional condition, nor did he state or imply\nthat the FTCA\u2019s  venue p rovis ion was different from most other federal venue s tatutes unde r which courts\nconsidered venu e to be a privilege s ubject to waiver. Fur ther, there is no indication in the statute itself or\nin its legisl ative hi story th at Congres s, by plac ing th e venue  provisi on in the \u201cjurisdiction\u201d section of the\nstatute, intended to change t he commonly under stood nature of venue a nd give it  jurisdictional status. \nTo the contrary, al l reliable indications of legisla tive int ent show that Congres s meant  the FT CA\u2019s\nvenue p rovis ion to perform the traditional function of venue p rovis ions in federal statutes, namely, to\nprovide a  privilege fo r the defense to assert, if appropriate, or waive. Indeed, federal venue l aw shows  that\nCongres s historically unde rstood that the FTCA\u2019s  venue s tatute did not impact subject matter jurisdiction.\nThe 1948 revisio ns of the Judicial Code  included, wi thin its provisi ons on federal venue , a statement at 28\nU.S.C. \u00a7 1406 (b), that \u201c[n]othing in t his chapter shall impair the jurisdiction of a district court of any\nmatter involving a pa rty who does  not interpose timely and su fficient objection to the venue .\u201d This\nprovisio n, enacted after the FTCA and  as part of the same Act wh ich placed the FTCA\u2019s  venue p rovis ion\nin 28 U.S. C. \u00a714 02(b), reflects congres sional understanding at t he time tha t the venu e provisi ons in that\nchapter, including the FTCA\u2019s  venue p rovis ion, could not impact  district court jurisdiction, absent a\n\u201ctimely and s ufficient objection to the venue .\u201d See id. In other words, venue wa s not a matter of federal\nsubject matter jurisdiction that could be raised at any ti me. In fact, the Hou se Repo rt notes that the\ncodifications with respect to venue i n the 1948 Act, such as 28 U.S.C. \u00a7  1406(b), we re intended \u201cto clarify\nambiguiti es or to reconcile conflicts.\u201d H.R.Re p.

Stating that  \u201c[a]n intention to depart from a co urse or policy thus\ndeliberately set tled is not lightly to be  assumed,\u201d t he Co urt concluded that the provisi on at issue was  not\nintended to affect jurisdiction \u201cbut only to  prescribe the venu e for the actions brought.\u201d  Id. at 384-85.\nThus, despite its origina l inclusion wi th a section of the Act  labeled \u201cJurisdiction,\u201d there is no\nindication that Congres s intended to give the  FTCA\u2019s  venue a  special \u201cjurisdictional\u201d status. In enacting\nthe FTCA, Congres s was operating again st the background of the Pana ma Rai lroad decision, with no\neviden ce of an intent to supplant the rule of that case. A comm on canon of statutory cons truction is that\nCongres s enacts legisla tion in light o f the underlying com mon law ex isting at t he time and that Congress\ndoes not supplant that law abs ent strong evidence of an intent to do s o. See, e.g., United States v.\nBestfoods , 524  U.S. 51 , 63 (1998); Molzof v. Uni ted States, 502  U.S. 30 1, 30 7-08 (1992 ). See generally\n2B N ORMAN J. SINGER, STATUTES AND STATUTORY CONSTRUCTION, \u00a7 50.01, at 133-44 (6th ed. 2000).\nHere, Co ngress  enacted the FTCA at  a time when venu e was  interpreted as a privilege th at the defendant\ncould waive, even when  the venue  provisi on wa s within the jurisdictional provisi on of a statute. See\nPana ma Rai lroad, 264  U.S. a t 384-85. M oreover, t he enactment o f 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1406(b) just a few year s\nlater shows  congress ional understanding th at venue wa s subject to waiver (wi thout any spe cial exception\nfor waiver of  sover eign im munity statutes).  \nFinally, si nce the enactment o f the FTCA, cou rts that have i nterpreted venu e provisi ons for other\nstatutes, including sta tutes creating fe deral tort actions, have conc luded that the provisi ons are not\njurisdictional, even whe n the statute wai ves th e government\u2019 s soverei gn im munity. In 1948, in an action\nbrought un der the SAA, t he Supreme Court  found that a provisi on directing wher e suits should be brought\nfor an action of \u201clibel in personam\u201d was  a matt er of venue a nd not jurisdiction. Hoin ess v. Un ited States,\n335 U.S. 29 7, 30 1 (1948 ). Citing Pana ma Rai lroad, the Cou rt stated:\nCongres s, by descr ibing the district where the suit was to be brought, wa s not\ninves ting the federal courts \u201cwith a genera l jurisdiction expressed in terms\napplicable alike to all of them.\u201d See Pana ma R. Co . v. Johnson, [264 U.S.  at 384].\nIt was dealing wit h the conveni ence of the parties in suing or  being sued  at the\ndesignat ed places. The purpose of the Act  was to grant  seamen re lief again st the\nUnited States in its own c ourts. The concepts of residence and principal place of\n44 UNITED STATES ATTORNEYS\u2019 BULLETIN NOVEMBER 2010\nbusiness obvious ly can  have no  relevance wh en applied to the Un ited States. It is\nubiquitous throughout the land and, u nlike pri vate p arties, is not centered at one\nparticular place. The residence or principal place of business of the libelant and\nthe place wher e the vess el or cargo is  found may be t he best measure of the\nconvenien ce of the parties. But if the Uni ted States is willing to de fend in a\ndifferent place, we f ind nothing in t he Ac t to prevent it.\nId. at 302. \nLikewis e, in Tran scapital Leas ing Assocs. v. United States, 398  F.3d  1317, 13 19-22 (Fed. Cir.\n2005 ), the Federal Circuit found that the venu e provisi on wa s not jurisdictional in a statute that allowe d\nchallenges t o certain determinat ions of the Internal Revenue Se rvice . The court stated that \u201c[v]enue  relates\nto the locale in whic h a suit may  be properly ins tituted and is not related to the power  of the court to hear\nthe case or reach the parties.\u201d Id. at 1320 (quoting Minn. M ining &  Mfg. v. Eco Ch em, I nc., 757 F.2d\n1256 , 126 4 (Fed. Cir. 198 5) (emphasis added in Tran scapital)). Citing th e Supreme Cou rt\u2019s decision in\nPana ma Rai lroad, the court found it signifi cant that courts commonly found  that venue p rovis ions were\nnot jurisdictional. Tran scapital, 398  F.3d  at 1321-22. See also Na t\u2019l Wild life Fed\u2019n v. Br owne r, 237  F.3d\n670, 672-75 (D.C. Cir . 200 1) (finding a p rovis ion in the Clean Water Act allowin g review of  the\nEnviro nmental Protection Agency Adm inistrator\u2019s decisions in a particular circuit court of appeals was\nmerely a v enue provisi on, a nd not jurisdictional).\nIn sum, statutory ana lysis supports the conclusion that Congres s intended to incorporate\ntraditional concepts of venue i nto the FT CA. T here are no reliable indications of congress ional intent to\ntreat the FTCA\u2019s  venue s tatute as one of the jurisdictional conditions of the government\u2019 s waiver of\nsovere ign imm unity tha t the Un ited States may  invoke at any time. I nstead, the congres sional signpos ts\nshow that the FTCA\u2019s  venue p rovis ion is just like m ost other venue p rovis ions in federal law; it creates a\nprivilege t hat the Uni ted States may invoke in a  timely manner or waive. T herefore, if one perceives venue\nto be a potential issue in a case, it is crucial to raise venue a s a defense in the answe r or assert imprope r\nvenue i n a motion to dismiss a nd/or transfer the case prior to filing an an swer .  \nVI. Conclusion\nFede ral government l awyers  must carefully ass ess venue a t the outset of any la wsui t alleging a\nfederal tort. There can be grea t benefits to challenging an i nappropriate venue , including, pote ntially, th e\ndismissal of the case. More comm only, a cas e can be transferred to a district in whi ch litigation is more\nconvenien t or the controlling law i s more f avorab le. In any event, the assessment must be made early\nbecause a failure to preserve a venu e objection through an af firmati ve def ense or a motio n to dismiss wi ll\nlikely be de emed a wai ver.\u0098 \n        \nABOUT THE AUTHO R\n\u0091Adam  Bain is a Se nior Trial Coun sel in the Environ mental Torts Section of the Civil Di visio n.

Introduction\nThis article provides  an introduction to affirmati ve cla ims tha t the Un ited States may  have a gains t\nthird parties in Fede ral Tort Claims Act (FTCA) s uits. Be cause state law de termines  the substance of these\naffirmati ve cla ims, th e law of  the appropriate jurisdiction must be analyzed bef ore determining wheth er a\ncolorable affirmati ve cla im exis ts. This article highlights  basic issues that may ari se if a private i nsurance\npolicy or co ntract cover s condu ct subject to an FTCA cl aim.\nII. Definitions\nWhen two or  more people are liable for the same har m and one discharges th e liability by either a\nsettlement or  judgm ent, the discharging indi vidual  may rec over c ontribution from the other. In a majority\nof states, the individual  seeking cont ribution may rec over on ly the  amount wh ich exceeds that individ ual\u2019s\nshare of responsibility.\nIndemnity com es in two forms \u2014 contractual and comm on law. I n contractual indemnity, t wo\nparties agree  that one party wil l reimburse the second party, in f ull or in part, for damag es the second\nparty inc urs in certain actions. The content of the contract governs how the actions are indemnifi ed. \nCom mon-law indemnity al lows  a defendant who h as been found  liable to shift the full extent of liability to\na third person who  was the real-party-at-fault. Comm on-law indemnity has  eroded signifi cantly as t he\ndoctrines of compara tive fau lt and contribution have devel oped. Thus, many st ates have l imite d common-\nlaw indemnity to  situations in which an entirely bla meless defendant is vicar iously liable, or technically\nresponsible, for the real-party-at-fault\u2019s actions.  \nSubr ogati on usually arises in the insurance context. When proceeding in  subrogat ion, the\nsubrogee (insurer) \u201cstands in the shoes\u201d of one whos e claim he ha s paid (insured). The subrogee ha s all\nthe rights o f the person whos e claim he ha s assumed. \nIII. Affirmative claims in the FTCA context\nA. Indem nification\nThe circumstan ces under which a contractual indemnifi cation claim may ari se in FTCA cl aims are\nas broad as the number of risks in sured agains t, but two types  of cases are typical . First, perhaps the most\nfrequent application of indemnifi cation in the FT CA con text, is when  an employee ca uses damages whe n\noperating a pr ivate ly-owned  vehic le within the scope of his employment. A review o f the driver\u2019s\ninsurance policy must be made to determine whet her the Uni ted States is an additional insured under the\n46 UNITED STATES ATTORNEYS\u2019 BULLETIN NOVEMBER 2010\nterms of t he policy. Such  a determination is based on the language of  the policy and s tate contract and\ninsurance law. If the Un ited States is covered  under the policy, it  may the n tender the defense to the\ninsurance company. T he Un ited States, however,  must maintain at least some con trol of the defense. See\n28 U.S. C. \u00a7\u00a7 516-17 (20 10). Fur ther, the Un ited States may  turn to the insurance company to pa y a cla im\nwithin the policy\u2019s l imit. See, e.g., Way v. Uni ted States, No. 7 :00CV819-24, 2001  WL 1854501  at *3\n(D.S. C. Apr . 16, 2001); United States v. Gov\u2019 t Emp loyees Ins. Co ., 612 F.2d 705 (2d Cir. 198 0); Gov\u2019 t\nEmpl oyees Ins. Co. v . Uni ted States, 349 F.2d 83 (10th Cir. 1965), cert denied, 382  U.S. 10 26 (1966 ), reh.\ndenied, 383  U.S. 93 9 (1966 ); United States v. Gov \u2019t Empl oyees Ins. Co. , 409  F.Sup p. 98 6 (E.D. V a.\n1976 ); Eastman v . Uni ted States, 257 F.Sup p. 31 5 (S.D. I nd. 1 966).   \nSecond, contractual indemnifi cation frequently involves  contracts between the Un ited States and\nan independent contractor. Usua lly, thes e contracts are interpreted under federal common law be cause the\ncontract is executed under \u201cauthority confe rred by fede ral statute and, u ltimatel y, by  the Con stitution.\u201d \nUnited States v. Seckinger, 397  U.S. 20 3, 20 9-10 (1970 ). A contract need not include a specific\n\u201cindemnify and ho ld harmless\u201d clause or explicitly stat e that indemnity is  grant ed for the indemnite e\u2019s (in\nthis case the Uni ted States\u2019) negligent  acts to establish indemnity. Id. at 213. Acc ordingly, ea ch contract\nmust be analyzed ind ividu ally, and  the language of  the contract and \u201cother indicia of the parties\u2019\nintention\u201d will determine if the Uni ted States is indemnifi ed. Seckinger, 397  U.S. a t 209-10; Butler v.\nUnited States, 726  F.2d  1057, 10 64-65 (5th Cir. 198 4).    \nEven if  a contract between  the Uni ted States and a contractor does not expressly pro vide f or\nindemnifi cation, indemnity m ay none theless be implied. In Ritchie v. Uni ted States, a patient treated by a\ncontract physi cian at a U.S. Ai r Force base sued the Un ited States for medical malpractice. 732 F. Supp .\n1125 , 112 6 (W.D. Okla. 19 90). The Un ited States then brought i n the contract doctor\u2019s insurance\ncompany as a  third-party def endant. Id. The court determined that although the  contract between  the\nphysic ian and the Un ited States \u201cdid not explicitly requi re\u201d the doctor to indemnify the  United States, the\ncontract implied indemnity bet ween  the doctor and the Uni ted States. Id. at 1127. Be cause of this implied\nindemnity, th e Uni ted States could seek indemnit y from the physic ian\u2019s insurance company. Id. Acco rding\nto the court, this was fair because the insurance company ins ured the physic ian knowin g that  he was unde r\ncontract at the Air Force base but failed to explicitly excl ude his wor k ther e from covera ge. Id. Anot her\ncourt has adopted this approach. See United States v. CNA Fi n. Cor p., 168  F.Sup p. 2d  1109, 11 22 (D.\nAlaska 200 1) (noting that  even i f the Un ited States were found not to be an implied insured, \u201cthe court\nwoul d be inclined to grant  the Uni ted States summ ary judgm ent on its theory that  it is entitled to implied\nimmunity\u201d). It is wor th noting th at while federal comm on law governs a claim for contractual indemnity\nbased on a contract between  the Uni ted States and a contractor, state law wi ll govern whe ther implied\nindemnity exi sts between the parties. See U.S. Li nes, Inc. v. Uni ted States, 470  F.2d  487, 490  (5th Cir.\n1972 ).     \nB. Contribution\nState law also governs  contribution claims. See United States v. Yellow Cab Co. , 340 U.S. 54 3,\n546 (1951); Warner v. Uni ted States, 669 F.Sup p. 2d  234, 236  (N.D. Ill. 198 7) (collecting ca ses).  \nCont ribution law varie s signif icantly from state to state. See RESTATEMENT 3d T ORTS \u00a7 23  cmt a ( 1999 ).\nExamples  show this variety:  Indiana law doe s not allow for contribution, IND. CODE \u00a7 34-51-2-12 (2010 );\nstates following the Uniform Contr ibution Among  Tortfeasors Act do n ot allow contribution for any\nintentional tortfeasor, UNF. CONTRIBUTION AMONG TORTFEASORS ACT \u00a7 1(c) (1955); other states do, see\nRaqu et v. Braun, 381  N.E.2d  404, 407  (N.Y. 1997 ); in Florida, the law sur rounding cont ribution again st a\npreviousl y-exonerated or dismissed defendant is such a \u201cmorass \u201d that it is advis able to join all potentially-\nNOVEMBER 2010 UNITED STATES ATTORNEYS\u2019 BULLETIN 47\nliable defendants through thi rd-part y prac tice, FLORIDA CIVIL PRACTICE DAMAGES, CPD FL- CLE \u00a7 4 .18\n(2005). Thus, a close inspection of state contribution law is necessary to de termine i f, and how, an\naffirmati ve cont ribution claim can be made. \nEven if  there is no joint tortfeasor, the Un ited States may  have a  contribution claim ag ainst an\ninsurer to cover de fense costs. For  example, in a case wher e a health-care center\u2019s physi cian is allegedly\nnegli gent bo th before and after he was  \u201cdeemed\u201d a f ederal employee, th e physici an\u2019s insurer would be\nliable for acts prior to his becoming a fe deral employee a nd the Un ited States wou ld be liable for his acts\nafter he is named an employee. Both  the insurer and the Un ited States have obli gatio ns to defend and\ncontribution rights  for defense costs. See, e.g., Avonda le Ins. Inc. v. Tr avelers Index. Co., 774  F.Sup p.\n1416 , 143 6 (S.D.N.Y 19 91).  \nC. Sub rogation\nFor private  parties, subrogat ion is usually limited to the insurance context. In FT CA cas es,\nhowever , the Uni ted States may have a s tatutory ri ght to  subrogat ion. Unde r 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 233(g)( 2), the\nUnited States may  subrogat e any cla im for benefits under a physic ian\u2019s or Federally Suppo rted He alth\nCent er\u2019s insurance in a medical-malpractice action again st the Uni ted States. The subrogati on right r ests\nwith the Un ited States if the physic ian is \u201cdeemed\u201d an employee of  the Public Hea lth Service  under 42\nU.S.C. \u00a7 233, which confers immunity to the physi cian and wa ives t he Un ited States\u2019 imm unity unde r the\nFTCA. \nD. Aff irmative c laims in p ractice\nThe first step in determinin g whethe r the Un ited States has a right to  indemnity, co ntribution, o r\nstatutory subr ogati on is to closely exa mine the applicable contract or insurance policy to f ind the contract\nor policy language th at will govern.  \nThe section defining the effective da te of an insurance policy merits particular attention. The\npolicy may est ablish an effective da te in two ways. Fi rst, in an \u201coccurrence policy,\u201d the  policy holde r is\nprotected from act s that occur within the policy\u2019s e ffective da tes. Se cond, un der a \u201cclaims-made policy,\u201d\nthe holder is cover ed for acts, wh enever they occ urred, as long as t he claim is made within the policy\u2019s\nperiod. The exclusion section also deserves a ttention. That section may bar  any cl aim for indemnification\nfrom the Uni ted States. Finally, a wr ap-around  policy may spec ifically exc lude coverage f or claims that\nfall within the FT CA. T his may occu r in physici ans\u2019 policies if they work at Fede rally Suppor ted Hea lth\nCent ers. Fo r a reduced premium, the  policy may excl ude cover age fo r acts covered  by the  FTCA.\nIf an insurance company fai ls to perform its duty to indemnify the  United States unde r the terms\nof its policy, the  United States has a vari ety of re medies. It may  sue the insurance company unde r state\nlaw for breaching th e terms of the agreement. De pending on the  state, this action may  include claims of\nbreach of the duty to defend, breach of a duty of  good fa ith and fair dealing, an d punitive da mages. See,\ne.g., New Hamps hire Ins. Co. v . Uni ted States, No. 9 5-5524 5, 55 246, 1996 WL 436 509 at *1 (9th Cir.\nAug. 2, 199 6); see also, United States v. CNA F in. Corp ., 381  F. Su pp. 2 d 1088, 1 090 (D. Al aska 20 05).\nThe law surround ing whi ch statute of limitations - state or federal - applies to contribution claims\nis muddled. When the Un ited States possesses a federal statutory right to  a claim, such  as the Medical\nCare Recovery Act , 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2651 , the federal statute of limitations applies. See United States v.\nSummer lin, 310  U.S. 41 4, 41 6 (1940 ) (\u201cIt is well settled that the Uni ted States is not bound by stat e\nstatutes of limitations or subject to the defense of laches in enforcing its  rights.\u201d ) If the  specific statute\ndoes not set a limita tions period, the limita tions periods of 28 U.S .C. \u00a7 2 415 apply.  \n48 UNITED STATES ATTORNEYS\u2019 BULLETIN NOVEMBER 2010\nIf the Un ited States seeks c ontribution based solely on s tate law, th e state statute of limitations\nmay appl y. Court s are divided o n this issue. In United States v. Saint Louis University, the court found  that\nthe United States\u2019 contribution claim was su bject to the federal statute of limitations. No . 07-cv -0156 ,\n2007  WL 4115807  (S.D. Ill. Nov. 16, 2 007). The court found  that Summer lin controlled and the Un ited\nStates\u2019 right und er state law co uld not be nullified. Id. Two di strict courts have rej ected this analysis. In\nEstate of Nobi le v. Un ited States, Nobi le\u2019s estate sued the Un ited States under the FT CA for  medical\nmalpractice at a VA hos pital. 193  F.R.D. 5 8, 59  (D. Conn.  2000). After years  of discovery, the  United\nStates filed a third-party appo rtionment complai nt agains t a private  hospital alleging that  it, not the VA,\ncaused the decedent\u2019s death. Id. The hospital moved to  dismiss, contending that  the Uni ted States failed to\nfollow Conne cticut\u2019s requirement f or contribution claims. Id. Unde r that requirement, an apportionment\ncomplai nt must be filed 120 days aft er the origina l complaint in order to bring an action for contribution\nor indemnity. Id. at 60. The Un ited States argued i t was not subject to the state-law limitation. Id. The\ncourt held that the state statute created a new c ause of action that did not exist in common law an d\ntherefore \u201cthe remedy exi sts only dur ing th e prescribed period and the time li mitation is not to be treated\nas an ordinary stat ute of limitations, but rather as a limitation on the liability itself.\u201d Id. Finding the\nlimitation applicable to the Uni ted States, the court dismissed its claim for contribution. Id. at 62.  \nSimila rly, in Santiago v. United States, the court found  that Puerto Rico\u2019s statute of limitations\napplied to the Un ited States\u2019 claim for contribution. The court distinguish ed situations whe re the Uni ted\nStates \u201cenforc[ed] its rights  as sover eign purs uant to a federal statute\u201d from cir cumstan ces wher e the\nUnited States\u2019 contribution action was based solely on s ubstantive sta te law. 884  F. Su pp. 2 d 45, 50-51\n(D.P. R. 199 5). Noting th at it was an \u201copen question\u201d of whet her state or federal statutes of limitations\napplied in that limited circumstan ce, the court decided that a notice requirement was a prerequisite to any\naction again st a Pu erto Rico munici pality, and f ailure to comply wit h it barred the Un ited States\u2019\ncontribution claim ag ainst a munic ipality. Id. at 51.  \nThese cases applying the s tate statute of limitations to counterclaims asserted by the Un ited States\nadd emphasi s to the gene ral instruction that the contribution law of the appropriate jurisdiction must be\nexhaustively examined.  State law also governs  when  a claim for contribution accrues. See, e.g., United\nStates v. Saint Louis Univ ., 200 7 WL 411 5807 , at *5 (Nov. 16, 20 07) (\u201cBeca use the parties agree t hat the\nUnited States\u2019 right to  contribution in the instant case is created by the l aw of  Illinois, the Cou rt looks to\nIllinois law to determine when  this right fi rst existed.\u201d) Thus, state law wi ll always gov ern whe n the right\nto contribution accrues. It may  also govern wh en the right t o contribution expires. With the entire time to\nassert a contribution claim pote ntially det ermined solely by sta te law, it is crucial to understand that law\nwhen a potential claim is identified.        \nIn subrogatio n claims, because the subrogee \u201cs teps into the shoes\u201d of the person whos e claim he\nhas assumed, t he statute of limitations applicable to the claim remains with the subrogee. As  a gene ral\nprinciple, the Supreme Cou rt has firmly  established that the Uni ted States as a subrogee i s bound by the\nstatute of limitations of the claim it a ssumes. See Guar . Tru st Co. o f New York v. Un ited States, 304  U.S.\n126, 142 (1938).  \nCour ts have l ong hel d that a claim for indemnifi cation or contribution is not compulsory under\nFede ral Rule of Civil  Procedure 13, because it does not arise at the time of s ervice o f the complaint but\nmatures only after resolution of the underlying sui t. See Hall v. Ge neral Motors, 647  F.2d  175, 176\n(1980). But  if one party ple ads a substantive ini tial cross-claim again st the other party, th e parties may  be\n\u201copposing\u201d pa rties under Rule 13 and therefore required to initially plea d all claims, in cluding thos e for\ncontribution and indemnity. See, e.g., Rai nbow Mgmt. Gr oup, LTD v.  Atlantis Submari nes Hawai i, 158\nF.R.D. 65 6, 65 9-60 (D. Haw. 1 994). Thus, if the Uni ted States has both a substantive co unterclaim and\nNOVEMBER 2010 UNITED STATES ATTORNEYS\u2019 BULLETIN 49\ncontribution (or indemnity) c laim it must either plead both initially or wai t until resolution of the suit to\npursue either the substantive cla im, the contribution claim, or bo th.\u0098   \nABOUT THE AUTHO R\n\u0091Jack Wo odco ck has been a Trial Attorney for  the Torts Branch of the Civil Di visio n for 3 year s.

Introduction\nA number o f states have enac ted statutes that establish requirements that must be satisfied before\na plaintiff may file an action for medic al malpractice. Al though the y vary widel y, the s tatutes frequently\nrequire a party to attest to the merit  of a suit before an action is filed in court or shortly the reafter. For\nexample, some state statutes require an injured party to co nsult with a medical professional who, after\nconducting an i nvest igation, wi ll vouch f or the merit of an action alleging m edical malpractice. So me of\nthe statutes require that the medic al professional complete an expert's certificate of merit that plaintiff's\ncounsel must file with the initial pleading. Othe r states have enac ted statutes that require both parties to\nappear before a panel which considers the meri t of a medical malpractice claim befo re suit may  be\ninitiated. To the extent that these statutes require a plaintiff to mak e a showing of  merit as a condition to\nsuit, the Un ited States is entitled to this benefit in suits under the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA), 2 8\nU.S.C. \u00a7 1346 (b) (2010).\nII. Background\nIn the 1970s , the Uni ted States experienced wha t has been termed a \"medic al malpractice crisis.\" \nVarious authorities have of fered opinions regardi ng the cause of the crisis. Some ar gue tha t there was  a\nbreakdown i n the patient-docto r relationship. Ot hers point to the increased complexity of m edical service s\nand technology. Regard less of the underlying cau se or causes, the crisis signif icantly impact ed the medic al\nlandscape in the Un ited States. Be tween 1960 and 1970, medic al malpractice insurance rates rose\nsignifi cantly for s urgeon s, physic ians, and hospitals. See Elizabet h Urban Karzon, Medical Malpractice\nStatutes: A Ret rospective Anal ysis, 198 4 ANN. SURV. AM. L. 693, 693 n.1. Certain insurers even s topped\nprovidin g coverage i n states such as New Yor k and M aryland. Id. at 693 n.2; Att\u2019y Gen. v. Johns on, 385\nA.2d 5 7, 61  (Md. 19 78); St. Pau l Fire & Marine Ins. Co. v . Ins. Co mm\u2019r , 339  A.2d 2 91 (Md. 197 5).\n50 UNITED STATES ATTORNEYS\u2019 BULLETIN NOVEMBER 2010\nIndeed, nearly every stat e enacted measur es in an attempt to  control skyrocketin g insu rance rates and\ninsurers' refusals to provide c overage. K arzon, supra. at 693. State legisl ation came in vari ous forms,\nincluding li mits on the amount of damages re covera ble for non-economic ha rm, peri odic payment of\nfuture damage awar ds, and, as is relevant he re, certification of merit as a precondition to filing sui t.\nBeca use these tort reforms are applicable to private  party def endants, the Un ited States is entitled to assert\nthem as liability is imposed  by the  FTCA \"u nder circumstan ces wher e the Un ited States, if a private\nperson, woul d be liable to the claimant i n accordance with the law of  the place wher e the act or omissi on\noccurred.\" 28 U.S .C. \u00a7 1 346(b) (2010).    \nIII. Statutes imposing unilateral requirements on plaintiffs to establish merit\nA number o f states have pass ed statutes that require a plaintiff to verify the  merit of a suit during\nthe case's inf ancy. Such s tatutes do not require the defendant to take any sor t of action. Oftentimes, t hese\nunilateral statutes require the submissi on of a certificate or affidavit  of merit along wit h the plaintiff's\ninitial pleading, see, e.g., MINN. STAT. ANN. \u00a7 145.682 (2002 ), or shortly ther eafter, see, e.g., COLO. REV.\nSTAT. ANN. \u00a7 13-20-602(1)(a) (1995). Some st ates require that the certificate of merit be complet ed by a\nhealth care professional, see, e.g., W. VA. CODE ANN. \u00a7 55-7B-6 (2003 ), wh ile others require that the\nplaintiff's attorney att est to undertaking a good fa ith invest igation of the claim befo re initiating sui t. See,\ne.g., MISS. CODE ANN. \u00a7 11-1-58 (2002 ).  \nSevera l courts throughout t he Un ited States have hel d that plaintiffs must c omply wit h these\nunilateral requirements in suits brought p ursuant to the FTCA. T hese decisions are based on the FTCA's\nwaiver of  sover eign im munity, whic h provides  that the Uni ted States may only be held liable \"in the same\nmanner and to the same ext ent as a private i ndividual  under like cir cumstan ces []. . . .\" 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2674\n(2010). In interpreting th is language, the  Supr eme Court  has consistently fou nd that a state's substantive,\nnot procedural, law is applicable in actions brought u nder the FTCA. See FDIC v . Meyer, 510  U.S. 47 1,\n478 (1994) (\"[W]e have c onsistently held that \u00a7 1346(b)'s reference to the 'law of  the place' means law of\nthe State\u2014the source of substantive liability under  the FT CA.\")  Many cour ts have de emed st ate laws that\nrequire an injured party to f ile a certificate of merit to be substantive, an d therefore applicable to suits\nbrought pu rsuant to the FTCA. E.g., Hill v. Smi thKline Beecham Corp ., 393 F.3d  1111, 11 18 (10th Cir.\n2004 ) (\"In a fe deral action predicated upon diver sity jurisdiction, we h ave det ermined that Colorado's\ncertificate of review re quirement is a substantive rul e of law. Cons equently, we c onclude that the\nColo rado review s tatute is applicable to professional negligenc e claims bro ught agai nst the Uni ted States\nunde r the FTCA.\")  (citation omitt ed); Park er v. Uni ted States, 475  F. Su pp. 2 d 594, 59 8 (E.D. V a. 2007)\n(\"[P]laintiff's failure to obtain a certificate of merit, [as required by the V irginia  Medical Malpractice\nAct,] is fatal to his claim.\"), aff'd per curiam on other ground s, 251  Fed. Appx . 818  (4th Cir. 200 7);\nStanley v. Uni ted States, 321  F. Su pp. 2 d 805, 80 9 (N.D. W . Va. 2004) (ruling that  West Virginia 's pre-\nlitigatio n filing re quirement in W. Va. Co de \u00a7 55-7B-6 was  substantive an d plaintiff was required to\ncomply with  it in an FTCA act ion); Oslund v. Uni ted States, 701  F. Su pp. 7 10, 7 14 (D. M inn. 198 8)\n(\"[C]ompliance with [Minn. Stat.] \u00a7 145.682 is necessary in an y clai m of malpractice under Minnesota\nlaw, no matt er how t he court obtains jurisdiction over t he claim.\")  \nOppos ing cou nsel will frequently overl ook the  FTCA's \"private p erson\" language, as  well as the\ncaselaw mandat ing pl aintiffs' compli ance with substantive st ate pre-filing requ irements.  Indeed, plaintiffs'\ncounsel often erroneously bel ieve tha t compliance with the FTCA's administrative cla im proc ess is\nsufficient. In some jurisdictions, a plaintiff's failure to comply wit h a state's unilateral statute results in\ndismissal, typi cally wit hout prejudice. The FTCA's statute of limitations, however,  \"forever ba rs\" an\naction initiated more t han 6 months  after denial of an adminis trative cl aim. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2401 (b) (2010).\nThus, if a plaintiff attempts t o initiate a new lawsu it with a certificate of merit, her action may be\nNOVEMBER 2010 UNITED STATES ATTORNEYS\u2019 BULLETIN 51\njurisdictionally time-barred if filed more than 6 month s after the federal agency' s denial of her\nadminis trative cl aim.\nSuch  statutes also require a plaintiff to do more preparatory wor k and may  give def ense couns el\nthe benefit of learning earl ier whether a plaintiff will be able to find an expert to support her medical\nmalpractice allegati ons. In this way, coun sel is better informed as  to whet her the case should be settled\nsooner, later, or not at all. In addi tion, s tate statutes requiring pl aintiffs to file pre-litigatio n certificates of\nmerit allow discovery of  the identity of a plaintiff's probable testifying exper t; this provides  an oppo rtunity\nto conduct background research on that individ ual.\nOver th e last several  years , unilateral state pre-litigatio n statutes have led  to favorabl e decisions\nfor the Uni ted States in vario us districts, including Color ado, Minnesota, Virginia , and West Virginia . \nFor example, in Kikumur a v. Osag ie, 461  F.3d  1269 (10th Cir. 2006), the Tenth Circuit stated:\nUnder  Colorado law, l itigant s who  bring a c laim \u201cbas ed upon the alleged pro fessional \nnegli gence o f . . . . a  licensed professional\u201d must \u201cfile with the court a certificate of review . . .  . \nwithin [60] days af ter the service o f the complaint . . . . unless the court determines that a longer \nperiod is necessary for good cause shown.\u201d Co lo. Rev. Sta t. \u00a7 13-20-602(1)(a). This \ncertificate of review m ust declare that the plaintiff's attorney, or t he plaintiff himself  in a pro se \naction, see Yadon  v. Southwar d, 64 P.3d 909, 912 (Colo. Ct. App. 2 002), \u201chas consulted a person \nwho ha s expertise in the area of the alleged ne gligent conduct,\u201d and that \u201cthe professional who h as\nbeen consulted . . . has concluded the filing of  the claim . . . doe s not lack sub stantial \njustification.\u201d \u00a7 13-20-602(3)(a). We have pre viousl y held that \u201cColo rado's certificate of review \nrequirement is a substantive rul e of law,\u201d a nd is therefore \u201capplicable to professional negligenc e \nclaims brought a gains t the Un ited States under the FT CA.\u201d\nId. at 1297-99. F urther, in Stanley v. Uni ted States, 321  F. Su pp. 2 d 805, 80 8 (N.D. W . Va. 2004), the\ndistrict court dismissed the plaintiff's FTCA cl aim for failure to submit a medic al screening cer tificate of\nmerit as required by We st Virginia 's Medical Professional Liability Act.  Addi tionally, in Ross  v. Un ited\nStates, No. 0 6-cv-141, 2007 WL 514 5351  (E.D. V a. Jan. 29, 2 007), the court dismissed an FTCA sui t as a\nresult of plaintiff's failure to comply wit h Virginia 's statute requiring th at a party alleging m edical\nmalpractice obtain an expert certificate of merit prior to serving pro cess upon the defendant. Oth er states\nhave en acted simila r statutory re quirements that may be ut ilized i n defending m edical malpractice cases\nbrought pu rsuant to the FTCA.\nIV. State statutes imposing bilateral obligations on plaintiffs and defendants to\nestablish merit\nThe scenario is compli cated wh enever a s tate statute imposes  a corresponding duty on a  defendant\nto submit to the jurisdiction of a state screening, m ediation, or alternative dis pute resolution panel.\nSovere ign imm unity, howe ver, pr ecludes imposition of such requirements on the Un ited States.\nA statute on p oint is the M aryland He alth Care Malpractice Claims Act, MD. CODE ANN., CTS. &\nJUD. PROC. \u00a7\u00a7 3-2A-01 (2010 ) et seq., whi ch prescribes vari ous prerequisites that must be satisfied before\nthe filing of a ny m edical malpractice cause of action seeking damages in  excess of $5,0 00. Id. \u00a7\u00a7 3-2A-\n02(a); 4-402(d)(1) (2010). A pe rson seeking to  file a claim for injuries agains t a medical provider  must\nfirst present that claim to the Director of the Marylan d's Health Claims Alt ernative Dis pute Resolution\nOffice. Id. at \u00a7 3-2A- 04(a) (2010). Within 90 d ays of  filing the claim, the injured party must file a\ncertificate from an e xpert \"attesting to  departure from sta ndards of care, and that the departure from\nstandards of care is the proximate c ause of the alleged i njury\" u nless the \"sole issue in the claim is l ack of\n52 UNITED STATES ATTORNEYS\u2019 BULLETIN NOVEMBER 2010\ninformed co nsent.\" Id. at \u00a7 3-2A- 04(b)(1) (2010). A pa rty disp uting lia bility must then submit a  similar\ncertificate within 120 days of s ervice o f the claimant' s certificate. Id. at \u00a7 3-2A- 04(b)(2) (2010). Eac h\nparty must file the certificate \"with a report of the attesting exp ert attached.\" Id. at \u00a7 3-2A- 04(b)(3)(i)\n(2010). Either party may unil aterally elect to waive the  arbitration process before the Hea lth Claims\nAlternative Dis pute Resolution Of fice after filing th e respective ce rtificates. Id. at \u00a7 3-2A- 06B ( 2010 ).       \nIt does not necessarily foll ow that the Uni ted States must comply with  the Maryland He alth Care\nMalpractice Claims Act's condition precedent that requires a defendant to file a certificate contesting\nliability wit h the He alth Care Alternative Disp ute Resolution Of fice. None theless, in Mayo-Park s v.\nUnited States, 384  F. Su pp. 2 d 818 (D. M d. 20 05), the district court concluded that the Uni ted States'\nfailure to proffer a countervailing m edical expert witness certificate precluded the Un ited States from\ncontesting li ability. T he court\u2019s reasoning in t hat case is fundamentally flawed . In wai ving the Un ited\nStates' sover eign im munity unde r the FTCA, Congres s did not authorize or r equire the Un ited States to\nappear before a state body such a s Maryland's alt ernative di spute resolution panel as a precondition to\ndefending it self. Indeed,  Congres s explicitly pro vided t hat the U.S. district courts have \" exclusive\njurisdiction\" over FT CA act ions. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346(b)(1) (2010). Plaintiffs usually argue tha t if they m ust\ncomply with  a bilateral state pre-litigatio n statute, so, too, must t he Un ited States. This argument\nmisconstrues the concept of sover eign im munity and the unique position of the Uni ted States. On t his\npoint, a quote from J ustice Powell is appropriate: \nThe Federal Tort Claims Act is not a federal remedial  scheme at  all, but a wai ver of\nsovere ign imm unity tha t permits an injured claimant to recover damag es agains t the \nUnited States whe re a private p erson \u201cwou ld be liable to the claimant i n accordance with \nthe law of the place wher e the act or omissi on occurred.\u201d . . . . The FTCA gi ves the \nplaintiff even less than he woul d receive unde r state law in many  cases, because the \nstatute is hedged with protections for the Un ited States.\nCarlson v. Gr een, 446  U.S. 14 , 28 (1980) (Powell, J., concurring) ( emphasi s added).\nAnal ogous s cenarios provide s uppo rt for the argum ent that the Uni ted States is entitled to the\nbenefit of bilateral pre-litigatio n statutes. Fo r instance, some states allow he alth care provider s to take\nadvant age of  the state's non-economic da mages c ap only if  the provider s are licensed by the  state.  See,\ne.g., VA. CODE. ANN. \u00a7 8.01-581.15 (2008 ). Other states limit the availa bility of a n on-economic da mages\ncap to provider s that file proof of financial responsibility and co ntribute to a patient compensa tion fund.\nSee, e.g., NEV. REV. STAT. \u00a7\u00a7 44-2821 , 2824  (2009); LA. REV. STAT. ANN. \u00a7 40:1299.42 (2006 ). The\nUnited States does not satisfy such s tate statutory cond itions. Ye t federal courts have r ecognized th at the\nUnited States is entitled to the benefit of these and other state law def enses in FTCA act ions, despite its\nfailure to comply with  the statutory te chnical requirements. Fo r example, in Starns v. Un ited States, 923\nF.2d 34 (4th Cir. 199 1), the Fourth Circuit held that Virginia 's statutory ca p on damages in  medical\nmalpractice actions applied to federal hospitals, even tho ugh the  statute applied only to  \"health care\nprovider s\" licensed by the  Com monwea lth of Virginia . VA. CODE. ANN. \u00a7 8.01-581.1(1) (2008 ). The\nFour th Circuit explained that \nVirginia  law, as  applied to private  parties in \u201clike ci rcumstances,\u201d determines  the extent of the\ngovernment's liability in t his case. Since private h ealth care provider s in Virginia  woul d in \u201clike\ncircumstances\u201d be entitled to the benefit of \u00a7 8.01 -581.15, s o, too, is a federally oper ated hospital\nin that state. \nStarns, 923  F.2d  at 37; see also Lozada v. Uni ted States, 974  F.2d  986 (8th Cir. 199 2) (holding Unit ed\nStates is entitled to benefit of non-economic da mages c ap although gov ernment did not file proof of\nfinancial responsibility or co ntribute to Nebr aska' s excess liability fun d); Owen v . Uni ted States, 935  F.2d\nNOVEMBER 2010 UNITED STATES ATTORNEYS\u2019 BULLETIN 53\n734 (5th Cir. 1991) (holding Loui siana's medic al malpractice liability cap a pplicable in FT CA sui t even\nthough Unit ed States had not filed proof of financial responsibility or co ntributed to patient's\ncompensa tion fund as required by st ate statute); Taylor v. Uni ted States, 821  F.2d  1428, 14 31-32 (9th Cir.\n1987 ) (holding Unite d States is entitled to liability limitat ion although it  did not meet definition of \"health\ncare provider \" under California law); Scheib v. Fla. San itarium &  Benevolent Ass'n, 759  F.2d  859, 863 -64\n(11th Cir. 198 5) (holding Unit ed States is entitled to benefit of Florida collateral source rule, whi ch wa s\nestablished by sta tute and applied to Florida-licensed hospitals or physi cians). These cases suppo rt the\nposition that the Uni ted States is entitled to the benefit of a bilateral certificate of merit or screening\nstatute, notwithstanding th e fact that the Uni ted States does not submit t o the jurisdiction of a state board.  \nV. Conclusion\nState pre-litigatio n screening or c ertificate of merit statutes may  be raised to gain advant ageous\nresults in suits brought p ursuant to the FTCA. Wh ile severa l cases pertaining to uni lateral state pre-\nlitigatio n statutes may  be found, the law involving bil ateral statutes is in its infancy.

Schott, J.D. Law enforcement personnel expose themselves to risks every day. Those risks include the possibility of being sued civilly for something they did while performing law enforcement duties. While acting in the scope of their employment, federal, state, and local officers can be sued for intentionally violating a person\u2019s constitutional rights.1Like anyone else facing a lawsuit, officers have various defenses available to assert in their defense. Of course, these include all of the traditional defenses available in a civil case.2 Additionally, law enforcement personnel are protected by the doctrine of qualified immunity. In 1982, 11 years after its Bivens decision, the Supreme Court provided the modern standard for determining whether a government employee is entitled to qualified immunity.3 Since then, the test for whether qualified immunity is appropriate in a particular case has been applied differently, but the scope of its protection has remained unchanged. Over the past 12 years, the Supreme Court has provided additional guidance regarding the protection afforded by qualified immunity, including three cases decided this past term. This article will provide a historical discussion of the doctrine of qualified immunity, review the changes the Supreme Court has provided to determine whether qualified immunity should apply in a particular case, and summarize three very recent Supreme Court cases addressing this issue and how these decisions impact the law enforcement community.Qualified Immunity DoctrineClearly Established LawWhile law enforcement officers recognize the inherent risks of their occupation, they should be comforted by the description given by the Supreme Court as to the effect of the qualified immunity doctrine on one of those inherent risks\u2014that of being sued civilly. In Harlow v. Fitzgerald, the Court explained that \u201cgovernment officials performing discretionary functions generally are shielded from liability for civil damages insofar as their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.\u201d4 The plaintiff in Harlow, A. Ernest Fitzgerald, sued, among others, President Richard M. Nixon and one of his aides, Bryce Harlow, alleging that he was dismissed from his employment with the Air Force in violation of his First Amendment and other statutory rights. Special Agent Schott is a legal instructor at the FBI Academy. The defendants sought immunity from the lawsuit. While ruling on the issue of immunity, the Supreme Court distinguished the president from his aide. First, the Court noted that its \u201cdecisions consistently have held that government officials are entitled to some form of immunity from suits for damages. As recognized at common law, public officers require this protection to shield them from undue interference with their duties and from potentially disabling threats of liability.\u201d5 Justice Powell, writing for the Court, continued by recognizing that:[o]ur decisions have recognized immunity defenses of two kinds. For officials whose special functions or constitutional status requires complete protection from suit, we have recognized the defense of \u201cabsolute immunity.\u201d The absolute immunity of legislators, in their legislative functions, and of judges, in their judicial functions, now is well settled. Our decisions also have extended absolute immunity to certain officials of the Executive Branch. These include prosecutors and similar officials, executive officers engaged in adjudicative functions, and the President of the United States. For executive officials in general, however, our cases make plain that qualified immunity represents the norm. [W]e [have] acknowledged that high officials require greater protection than those with less complex discretionary responsibilities.6 Based on this reasoning, Harlow\u2014Nixon\u2019s aide\u2014was entitled not to absolute immunity, but, rather, to qualified immunity.The Court then reexamined its earlier treatment of qualified immunity. Prior to this case, qualified or \u201cgood faith\u201d immunity included both an objective and a subjective aspect. The subjective aspect involved determining whether the government actor in question took his \u201caction with the malicious intention to cause a deprivation of constitutional rights or other injury.\u201d7 This subjective determination typically would require discovery and testimony to establish whether malicious intention was present. Having to go through the costly process of discovery and trial, however, conflicted with the goal of qualified immunity to allow for the \u201cdismissal of insubstantial lawsuits without trial.\u201d8Recognizing this dilemma, the Court altered the test to determine whether qualified immunity was appropriate. The new test, as stated earlier, is that \u201cgovernment officials performing discretionary functions generally are shielded from liability for civil damages insofar as their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.\u201d9 By applying the reasonable person standard, the Supreme Court established, for the first time, a purely objective standard to determine whether granting a government official qualified immunity was appropriate.While Harlow did not involve a law enforcement officer\u2019s actions, the decision is significant because law enforcement officers are government officials who perform discretionary functions and may be protected by qualified immunity. This shield of immunity is an objective test designed to protect all but \u201cthe plainly incompetent or those who knowingly violate the law.\u201d10 Stated differently (but just as comforting to law enforcement officers), officers are not liable for damages \u201cas long as their actions reasonably could have been thought consistent with the rights they are alleged to have violated.\u201d11 As protective as the language in these post-Harlow cases would suggest qualified immunity is, qualified immunity is not appropriate if a law enforcement officer violates a clearly established constitutional right.For example, in Groh v. Ramirez, a special agent for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF) applied for and received from a U.S. magistrate judge a search warrant authorizing the search of a home located on a ranch.12 The purpose of the search was to locate and seize a \u201cstockpile of firearms.\u201d13 While the magistrate judge had reviewed a detailed itemization of the firearms in the application for the search warrant, the search warrant itself did not include any such itemization. Rather, the ATF agent inadvertently \u201ctyped a description of respondent\u2019s two-story blue house rather than the alleged stockpile of firearms.\u201d14The homeowner sued the ATF agent for a violation of his Fourth Amendment right to be free from \u201cunreasonable searches and seizures.\u201d15 Of course, the Fourth Amendment also mandates that search warrants \u201cparticularly describ[e] the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.\u201d16 Despite this clear mandate, the ATF defendant to the civil lawsuit argued that he was entitled to qualified immunity because even if the improperly written search warrant constituted a Fourth Amendment violation, his failure to include a particular description did not violate a clearly established right at the time. The Court quickly dispatched the notion that the inadequate warrant was simply a \u201ctechnical mistake or typographical error\u201d that did not rise to the level of a constitutional violation.17 Finding the violation, the Court turned to whether the right was clearly established at the time the violation occurred.The Supreme Court used decisive language to show that the homeowner\u2019s rights had been clearly established before the violation in this particular case occurred. The Court pointed out that \u201cthe particularity requirement is set forth in the text of the Constitution.\u201d18 The Court then referred to a previous decision by the Court in this area, stating, \u201cas we noted nearly 20 years ago in Sheppard: \u2018The uniformly applied rule is that a search conducted pursuant to a warrant that fails to conform to the particularity requirement of the Fourth Amendment is unconstitutional.\u2019\u201d19 Accordingly, the request for qualified immunity was rejected.Constitutional Violation/Objective ReasonablenessEven if the law is clearly established, the law enforcement officer is entitled to qualified immunity if there was no constitutional violation in the first place. For example, in County of Sacramento v. Lewis, the deputies involved in a fatal high-speed pursuit were sued by the decedent\u2019s parents for a due process violation.20 The alleged constitutional violation was due process because the decedent was not intentionally seized by the deputies, but, rather, accidentally struck by one of the deputies after the motorcycle being pursued crashed in front of the pursuing deputies. The decedent, in fact, had merely been a passenger on the motorcycle. The Supreme Court afforded the deputies qualified immunity because even when based on a favorable view of the plaintiffs\u2019 allegations, there simply was no violation of due process. The court noted that to violate the Due Process Clause, the deputies had to intend to cause harm, and that had not been the case.21 Rather, the [deputy\u2019s] \u201cinstinct was to do his job as a law enforcement officer, not to induce [the decedent\u2019s] lawlessness, or to terrorize, cause harm, or kill.\u201d22While the two determinations into whether qualified immunity should apply have been well-settled, which of the two separate inquiries to analyze first has not been.Application of the Qualified Immunity TestAlmost 30 years after the Supreme Court provided the objective test to determine whether qualified immunity should be afforded a defendant, it provided specific, if only short-lived, guidance on how and in what order to apply the two-part test. In Saucier v. Katz, a protestor at an event that included Vice President Albert Gore, Jr., was arrested by a military police officer.23 The arrested protestor sued the officer, alleging that during the arrest, excessive force was used, which violated his Fourth Amendment rights. The officer\u2019s request for qualified immunity was denied by both the district court and by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.24 In denying qualified immunity on the issue of excessive force, the Ninth Circuit first found that the \u201claw governing the official\u2019s conduct was clearly established,\u201d focusing on the general right to be free from excessive force.25 The Ninth Circuit then concluded that the reasonableness inquiry into the amount of force used should be determined by a jury, ruling out qualified immunity for the officer.The Supreme Court disagreed with the Ninth Circuit and pointed out that its reasoning would contravene the purpose of granting qualified immunity at an early stage of court proceedings \u201cso that the costs and expenses of trial are avoided where the defense is dispositive.\u201d26 To satisfy this purpose, the Supreme Court ruled that the first inquiry into a request for qualified immunity must be whether a constitutional right would have been violated on the facts alleged; then, and only if the answer to the first inquiry is affirmative, does the question of whether the right was clearly established at the time of the alleged violation have to be answered. The Supreme Court also disagreed with the Ninth Circuit\u2019s rationale that only a jury could decide whether the force used in this instance was excessive, making its two-step approach workable even in excessive force claims.27While the Supreme Court\u2019s guidance in Saucier provided a mandatory two-inquiry test to be used for future qualified immunity cases and while that test was effective for the facts at hand, rigid compliance to the two-step inquiry soon fell out of favor. Lower courts struggled to apply Saucier because it was not always practical to decide whether a constitutional violation occurred before addressing whether the constitutional right at issue had been clearly established. While some lower courts began deviating from the Supreme Court\u2019s rigid two-inquiry approach, others were at least expressing frustration with it.28 Even the Supreme Court itself did not always see fit to follow its own mandate. In Brousseau v. Haugen, another excessive force allegation against a law enforcement officer was resolved by affording the officer qualified immunity.29 However, in finding qualified immunity appropriate, the Court deviated from its own pronouncement from three\u00a0years earlier in Saucier. In a per curium opinion in Brousseau, the Court found in this case that the officer\u2019s use of force\u2014shooting an unarmed but \u201cdisturbed felon, set on avoiding capture through vehicular flight\u201d\u2014fell in the \u201chazy border between excessive and acceptable force.\u201d30Because of the close-call nature as to whether the amount of force used was reasonable, the Court granted qualified immunity based on the lack of a clearly established right, rather than any possible constitutional violation or lack thereof. Based on the Supreme Court\u2019s earlier decision in Saucier, however, that was exactly the dilemma the Ninth Circuit found itself in when deciding Brousseau.31 Recognizing that it was not only the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals that found itself in the position\u2014\u201cunnecessarily to decide difficult constitutional questions when there [was] available an easier basis for the decision\u201d\u2014of whether qualified immunity should apply, the Supreme Court modified the mandatory formula it set forth in Saucier.32In 2009, the Supreme Court decided Pearson v. Callahan.33 The case involved the warrantless arrest of a subject at his home immediately following his sale of illegal drugs to a police informant. The arresting officers relied on the notion of \u201cconsent once removed\u201d to make entry into the home following the informant\u2019s drug purchase. The arrested homeowner sued the arresting officers, asserting that the warrantless entry of his home was a Fourth Amendment violation, arguing that \u201cconsent once removed\u201d was limited to an undercover officer being invited in and that it did not apply in cases where an informant was invited in.The officers requested qualified immunity. The district court deemed that they were entitled to immunity. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit methodically applied the two-pronged inquiry handed down by the Supreme Court six\u00a0years earlier and determined that the grant of qualified immunity was improper.34 Recognizing that the \u201cSaucier procedure has been criticized by Members of this Court and by lower court judges, who have been required to apply the procedure in a great variety of cases and thus have much firsthand experience bearing on its advantages and disadvantages,\u201d the Court, in granting certiorari, \u201cdirected the parties to address the question whether Saucier should be overruled.\u201d35 A unanimous Court softened the mandatory nature of the Saucier approach, receding from without totally abandoning it. Justice Alito, writing for the entire Court, stated that \u201c[o]n reconsidering the procedure required in Saucier, we conclude that, while the sequence set forth there is often appropriate, it should no longer be regarded as mandatory. The judges of the district courts and the courts of appeals should be permitted to exercise their sound discretion in deciding which of the two prongs of the qualified immunity analysis should be addressed first in light of the circumstances in the particular case at hand.\u201d36 Not surprisingly, in the case before them, the Court found the issue of qualified immunity easier to determine based on whether any violation (if one occurred at all) was of a clearly established right. Here, the Court found that at the time of the officers\u2019 actions, it was not clearly established that those actions were unlawful.37With the now-flexible Saucier test in place for three\u00a0years, the Supreme Court has ruled on three qualified immunity cases involving law enforcement/public safety personnel in just the past several months.2012 Qualified Immunity CasesIn Messerschmidt v. Millender, the Supreme Court ruled that officers were entitled to qualified immunity.38 Like the Groh v. Ramirez case discussed earlier, this case involved officers executing a search warrant later determined to be invalid.39 A detailed review of the facts leading up to the civil lawsuit at issue in Messerschmidt is required to appreciate the Court\u2019s holding.40When Shelly Kelly decided to leave her boyfriend Jerry Ray Bowen, she requested the presence of Los Angeles County, California, Sheriff\u2019s Department officers while she packed her things because of Bowen\u2019s past violent actions against her and others. When the officers got called away, Bowen showed up, and a violent encounter ensued. Kelly was able to get to her car and attempted to flee. However, before she could, Bowen got a black, sawed-off shotgun with a pistol grip, ran in front of Kelly\u2019s car, pointed the gun at her, and told her that if she tried to leave, he would kill her. When she sped away, Bowen fired at the car five times, blowing out the car\u2019s left front tire, but did not prevent her escape. Kelly found police officers, described the incident, and mentioned that Bowen was a member of the Mona Park Crips\u2014a local street gang\u2014and provided a picture of Bowen.The named defendant in the subsequent civil lawsuit, Detective Curt Messerschmidt, was assigned to investigate. Kelly provided to Messerschmidt the address of Bowen\u2019s foster mother as a probable location for him. She also advised him of Bowen\u2019s gang connections. Through independent investigation, Messerschmidt confirmed Bowen\u2019s connection to the foster mother\u2019s address and that Bowen was an active gang member. In reviewing Bowen\u2019s 17-page criminal history, Messershmidt learned that Bowen had been arrested on at least 31 occasions, including nine times for firearms offenses.Based on his investigation, Messerschmidt obtained a search warrant for the foster mother\u2019s home, authorizing the search for and seizure of, among other items, \u201cAll handguns, rifles, or shotguns of any caliber, or any firearms capable of firing ammunition, or firearms or devices modified or designed to allow it [sic] to fire ammunition. Any firearm capable of firing or chambered to fire any caliber ammunition. Articles of evidence showing street gang membership or affiliation with any Street Gang to include but not limited to any reference to \u2018Mona Park Crips,\u2019 including writings or graffiti depicting gang membership, activity, or identity.\u201d41Messerchmidt prepared two affidavits to support his warrant request. The first described Messerschmidt\u2019s extensive law enforcement experience, including his lengthy work involving gang-related crimes. The second affidavit, which was expressly incorporated into the search warrant, described the incident between Bowen and Kelly in great detail, to include a discussion of the sawed-off shotgun used in the assault. The affidavit also requested that the search be allowed to take place at night because of Bowen\u2019s gang ties. \u201cThe affidavit concluded by noting that Messerschmidt \u2018believe[d] that the items sought\u2019 would be in Bowen\u2019s possession and that \u2018recovery of the weapon could be invaluable in the successful prosecution of the suspect involved in this case, and the curtailment of further crimes being committed.\u2019\u201d42 Before submitting the application and affidavits to a magistrate, a sergeant and a lieutenant in Messerschmidt\u2019s department, as well as an assistant district attorney, reviewed Messerschmidt\u2019s work. A magistrate issued the warrant, and officers executed the search two days later. The officers, including Detective Messerschmidt, seized only the foster mother\u2019s shotgun, a box of .45 caliber ammunition, and a California Social Services letter addressed to Bowen.The Millenders (Bowen\u2019s foster mother and her daughter) subsequently filed a civil lawsuit in federal court suing, among others, Detective Messerschmidt, alleging that the search warrant at issue was invalid under the Fourth Amendment. The federal district court ruled against the individual defendants as to qualified immunity and found that the \u201cwarrant\u2019s authorization to search for firearms was unconstitutionally overbroad because the \u2018crime specified here was a physical assault with a very specific weapon\u2019\u2014a black sawed-off shotgun with a pistol grip\u2014negating any need to \u2018search for all firearms.\u2019\u201d43 The district court also found the warrant overbroad in that it allowed for the seizure of gang-related materials, but there \u201cwas no evidence that the crime at issue was gang-related.\u201d44On appeal to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, the three-judge panel reversed, finding that the officers were entitled to qualified immunity because \u201cthey reasonably relied on the approval of the warrant by a deputy district attorney and a judge.\u201d45 However, the en banc Court of Appeals granted a rehearing and reversed the three-judge panel, denying qualified immunity because the affidavits and warrant \u201cfailed to \u2018establish probable cause that the broad categories of firearms, firearm-related material, and gang-related material described in the warrant were contraband or evidence of crime.\u2019\u201d46The Supreme Court began its analysis of the qualified immunity issue by pointing out that \u201c[w]here the alleged Fourth Amendment violation involves a search or seizure pursuant to a warrant, the fact that a neutral magistrate has issued a warrant is the clearest indication that the officers acted in an objectively reasonable manner or, as we have sometimes put it, in \u2018objective good faith.\u2019\u201d47 But, Chief Justice Roberts, writing for the majority, goes on to say that the magistrate\u2019s issuance of a warrant is not the end of the qualified immunity inquiry. Qualified immunity still will \u201cbe lost, for example, where the warrant was \u2018based on an affidavit so lacking in indicia of probable cause as to render official belief in its existence entirely unreasonable.\u2019\u201d48 The Court did not find this to be the situation in this case. Accordingly, the Court found that qualified immunity was appropriate.With respect to the authorization to seize all firearms, the Court noted that \u201cit would not be unreasonable for an officer to conclude that there was a \u2018fair probability\u2019 that the sawed-off shotgun was not the only firearm Bowen owned,\u201d and it \u201ccertainly would have been reasonable for an officer to assume that Bowen\u2019s sawed-off shotgun was illegal.\u201d49 Therefore, Chief Justice Roberts continued, \u201ca reasonable officer could conclude that there would be additional illegal guns among others that Bowen owned.\u201d50 Chief Justice Roberts also explained that a reasonable officer could believe that seizing all firearms rather than just the sawed-off shotgun could be necessary to prevent Bowen from using a different weapon to do harm to Kelly.\u00a0Chief Justice Roberts then turned to the authority to seize gang paraphernalia during the search. Following a brief discussion of the potential uses for evidence of Bowen\u2019s membership in a gang, Roberts concludes by simply stating, \u201c[w]hatever the use to which evidence of Bowen\u2019s gang involvement might ultimately have been put, it would not have been \u2018entirely unreasonable\u2019 for an officer to believe that the facts set out in the affidavit established a fair probability that such evidence would aid the prosecution of Bowen for the criminal acts at issue.\u201d51Because reasonable officers could have reached these conclusions on the items to be seized, it cannot be said that the officers in this case violated anyone\u2019s clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known. Therefore, the Court did not have to determine whether the facts presented in the affidavits\u2014alone or taken together\u2014actually did establish probable cause. The Court pointed out that this is because the \u201c\u2018officers\u2019 judgment that the scope of the warrant was supported by probable cause may have been mistaken, but it was not \u2018plainly incompetent.\u2019\u201d52 This is consistent with one of the goals of qualified immunity, which is to \u201cgive government officials breathing room to make reasonable but mistaken judgments.\u201d53The Supreme Court decided two other qualified immunity cases shortly after ruling in Messerschmidt. In Filarsky v. Delia, the city of Rialto, California, hired Steve Filarsky, a private attorney, to assist in the internal investigation into one of its firefighters named Nicholas Delia.54 The city suspected that the firefighter remained on medical leave when he was capable of returning to work. The city initiated surveillance on Delia and observed him purchasing building supplies. Thinking Delia was doing a project at his home, rather than returning to work, the city ordered him to appear for an interview where Filarsky was present. After confronting Delia with their suspicions, fire department officials asked for consent to search Delia\u2019s home to see whether the work was ongoing or completed. He refused to provide consent, but was compelled by the department to produce the building materials onto his lawn so that the city officials could be sure he had not been working at his home during his medical-related absence from work.Delia brought a civil lawsuit against numerous individuals, including the private attorney, for a violation of his Fourth Amendment rights. Initially, the federal district court granted summary judgment to all of the individual defendants based on qualified immunity because there had not been a violation of a clearly established right.55 However, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals concluded that while the order to produce the materials from his home onto his lawn did violate Delia\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights, the court ruled that all defendants except for Filarsky, the private attorney, were entitled to qualified immunity because that right was not clearly established at the time the order was given.56 Finding no dispute that qualified immunity was appropriate in the case, the Supreme Court agreed only to determine whether the private attorney also was entitled to its protection even though he worked for the government on something other than a permanent or full-time basis.The Supreme Court found no reason to differentiate between the other defendants in this case and Filarsky. In fact, the Court found several reasons for treating them the same. Among those reasons was that \u201c[a]ffording immunity not only to public employees but also to others acting on behalf of the government similarly serves to \u2018ensure that talented candidates [are] not deterred by the threat of damages suits from entering public service.\u2019\u201d57 The Court noted the hypocrisy that would result if some people doing a job for the government could be sued personally, while government employees performing the same tasks would be protected by qualified immunity.Finally, the Supreme Court also entertained a qualified immunity case involving Secret Service Vice Presidential Protective Detail members in Reichle v. Howards.58 The issue in the case was not whether the Secret Service agents had probable cause to arrest, but whether they were immune from the suit that alleged the arrest was in retaliation for political speech protected by the First Amendment.The defendants in the civil suit were Secret Service agents assigned to protect Vice President Richard Cheney while he visited a shopping mall in Beaver Creek, Colorado, in 2006. When one of the agents overheard Steven Howards say he was going to ask the vice president an inflammatory question, the agents watched Howards closely. The agents saw Howards approach Cheney, make a comment to him, and touch the vice president before walking away. When questioned by the agents, he denied touching the vice president. Howards was arrested and charged with harassment under Colorado law. That charge was dismissed, but Howards brought a civil lawsuit claiming both First and Fourth Amendment violations. After the U.S. District Court for the District of Utah denied the agents\u2019 request for qualified immunity, the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit concluded that because the agents had probable cause to arrest Howards, they enjoyed qualified immunity from the Fourth Amendment claim. However, the Tenth Circuit denied qualified immunity as to the First Amendment allegation. The Supreme Court reversed, affording qualified immunity from the First Amendment allegation as well.The Court used its prerogative of first considering the \u201cclearly established\u201d prong of the two-prong inquiry into whether qualified immunity was available in reaching its conclusion. To be clearly established, the Court reminded, \u201ca right must be sufficiently clear \u2018that every reasonable official would [have understood] that what he was doing violates that right.\u2019\u201d59 Because \u201c[t]his Court has never recognized a First Amendment right to be free from a retaliatory arrest that is supported by probable cause[,] nor was such a right otherwise clearly established at the time of Howards\u2019 arrest,\u201d it stood to reason that the Secret Service agents involved in Howards\u2019 arrest were entitled to qualified immunity.60ConclusionLaw enforcement is a difficult profession. It presents many challenges and risks, as well as great rewards, to those who undertake it. One of the risks associated with law enforcement is the possibility of being sued civilly for an action taken in the course and scope of one\u2019s employment. In an effort to mitigate the costs and burden of defending oneself from a lawsuit, government actors are entitled to assert immunity as a barrier to being sued. For law enforcement officers, the level of immunity available is qualified immunity. As the name implies, this type of immunity is protective, but is not an absolute guarantee against successfully being sued. It is comforting, though, to know that the purpose of qualified immunity is to protect all but \u201cthe plainly incompetent or those who knowingly violate the law.\u201d61 As this article has demonstrated, the test to determine whether qualified immunity should be afforded officers has changed over the years, but the objective nature of the doctrine itself has remained unchanged for nearly 30 years. This objective determination often shields competent law enforcement officers from defending a suit itself, much less from being found liable at the conclusion of a suit. Endnotes1 42 U.S.C. \u00a71983 provides this statutory remedy against state and local law enforcement officers, while the Supreme Court created the same cause of action to be taken against federal law enforcement agents in Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of Federal Bureau of Narcotics, 403 U.S. 388 (1971). For a full discourse on the cause of action itself and the elements required for the officer or agent to be found liable, see R. Schott, \u201cDouble Exposure: Civil Liability and Criminal Prosecution in Federal Court for Police Misconduct,\u201d FBI Law Enforcement Bulletin, May 2008, 23-32.2 Fed. R. Civ.

Creighton, 483 U.S. 635, 640 (1987).60 566 U.S. at ___ (2012).61 Supra note 10. ClarificationThe U.S. Department of Justice\u2019s Office of Tribal Justice and the FBI\u2019s Legal Instruction Unit, Office of General Counsel, provide the following clarification to the article \u201cIndian Country and the Tribal Law and Order Act of 2010\u201d that appeared in the May 2012 issue. The article states that the Metlakatla Tribe is not subject to PL-280. That is not accurate. All Indian country in Alaska is subject to PL-280, including the Metlakatla Tribe\u2019s reservation. In Alaska and other areas subject to PL-280, tribes still possess authority to exercise criminal jurisdiction if they so choose. The Tribal Law and Order Act (TLOA) encourages but does not grant cross-deputization for law enforcement officers working in Indian country. The article incorrectly states that the Indian Civil Rights Act of 1968 (ICRA) prohibits the use of the exclusionary rule in tribal courts. In fact, the ICRA does not prohibit the use of the exclusionary rule in tribal courts. Also, the Major Crimes Act includes two additional criminal offenses that did not appear in the article: felony child abuse and neglect. Finally, while the TLOA provides for many important changes in the Indian country criminal justice system, the Act did not appropriate any funding for implementation.Also, the editorial staff would like to advise readers that the word \u201cThey\u201d was left out of the first sentence on page 18 of the article \u201cPicketers, Protesters, and Police: The First Amendment and Investigative Activity\u201d that appeared in the August 2012 issue. The sentence should have read, \u201cThey involve war protesters, death penalty protesters, persons participating in labor disputes, and political protesters and take the form of marches, rallies, and boycotts.\u201d The sentence in the August issue has been corrected in the online version.

Jones | Court DecisionsLegal InformationNon-Compete and Trade SecretsWage & Hour Issues Empower Your Business: Subscribe to our News & Updates for Practical Solutions Subscribe Home Our Blog Share post Print post The Supreme Court of the United States\u2019 (SCOTUS) decision last week in Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo marks a significant change in the legal landscape with respect to courts\u2019 authority to review rules and regulations issued by federal agencies. While this decision is unlikely to affect California courts\u2019 deference to California agencies, it gives employers greater opportunity to successfully challenge federal agency rulemaking in court. In a 6-3 decision, SCOTUS overruled Chevron v. Natural Resources Defense Council, which for the past 40 years required courts to defer to an agency\u2019s permissible interpretation of a statute if the statute was silent or ambiguous as to the precise issue in question. Chevron deference, the Court reasoned, is irreconcilable with the federal Administrative Procedure Act (APA), which commands that the reviewing court, not the agency, must decide all relevant questions of law. SCOTUS\u2019s decision in Loper Bright Enterprises gives courts the authority to exercise independent judgment in interpreting statutes, even where the statute is ambiguous. Consistent with the APA, courts may seek aid from the agency\u2019s interpretation and subject matter expertise, but courts must ensure the agency has engaged in reasoned decision-making within the boundaries of authority delegated to it by statute. Employers are likely to see challenges to a number of federal rules and regulations, including EEOC regulations implementing the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act, the FTC\u2019s non-compete ban, the pending appeal of the decision striking down the NLRB\u2019s new joint employment rule, and pending challenges to the new DOL rule increasing salary basis for exempt status under FLSA. This decision is unlikely to influence how California courts defer to California agencies. California courts continue to use the \u201cvariable deference\u201d test, under which courts typically follow an agency\u2019s interpretation of applicable law, with the degree of deference depending on factors specific to each case.

          "task_beliefs": "This observation, an internal reflection on my research process, provides no new factual information about the *Martin v. United States* case. Instead, it confirms the current state of my knowledge and solidifies the reasons for my predictive uncertainty. My beliefs about the case itself remain stable, but my confidence in the assessment of the *information landscape* has increased.\n\n1.  **Case Status (Stable & Confirmed):** My understanding of the procedural timeline is unchanged and now firmly established. The petitioners have filed their merits brief. The United States (respondent) has not. The critical document for advancing my analysis\u2014the respondent's merits brief\u2014is confirmed to be unavailable in the current dataset. My direct investigation of the case's substance is at a temporary, but well-defined, impasse.\n\n2.  **Legal Questions & Argumentative Priority (Stable):** My model of the legal battleground is unchanged.\n    *   **Supremacy Clause Argument (Stable):** The prediction of a **near-certain reversal** on this question holds firm. The government's decision not to defend the Eleventh Circuit's reasoning in its cert-stage BIO remains the most powerful signal on this issue.\n    *   **Primary Battleground - FTCA Interpretation (Stable & Impasse Confirmed):** The core of the case remains the statutory conflict between the discretionary function exception (\u00a7 2680(a)) and the law enforcement proviso (\u00a7 2680(h)). This observation confirms that my inability to refine my prediction on this point is a direct consequence of the unavailable respondent's brief. The central conflict is stable:\n        *   **Petitioners' View:** The specific law enforcement proviso (\u00a7 2680(h)) creates a clear exception to the general immunity granted by the discretionary function exception (\u00a7 2680(a)).\n        *   **Government's (Anticipated) View:** The discretionary function exception (\u00a7 2680(a)) is a jurisdictional prerequisite. If an action is discretionary, the court has no power to hear the case, making the proviso (\u00a7 2680(h)) irrelevant.\n\n3.  **Predictive Model (Stable with Defined Uncertainty):**\n    *   **On the Supremacy Clause Question:** Prediction of **reversal** is stable and high-confidence.\n    *   **On the Statutory Interpretation Question:** Prediction remains **highly uncertain, with a slight edge to the petitioners**. This observation solidifies that this uncertainty is a feature of the current information environment, not a flaw in my model. The path to reducing this uncertainty is now clear: I must wait for and analyze the respondent's merits brief.",
          "design_beliefs": "This internal monologue is a powerful observation for the design level. It represents a moment of strategic reflection, diagnosis, and planning, reinforcing several recent beliefs and adding a crucial new layer of strategic sophistication to my overall approach.\n\n1.  **Internal Consistency Checking (Stable):** Remains a core principle.\n2.  **Metadata is Evidentiary (Stable):** Remains a crucial heuristic for correctly identifying documents.\n3.  **Map Arguments to Procedural Stage (Stable):** Remains essential for avoiding confusion between cert-stage and merits-stage arguments.\n4.  **The BIO as a Strategic Bellwether (Stable):** The BIO remains the best available preview of the government's strategy.\n5.  **Prioritize Primary Sources (Stable):** The high value placed on the missing merits brief continues to validate this principle.\n6.  **The Research Cycle is Paramount (Reinforced & Refined):** This `THINK` action perfectly embodies the \"Diagnose -> Adapt\" phase of the cycle. By recognizing the impasse and formulating a plan to address a meta-level knowledge gap, I am executing a robust, self-correcting research process.\n7.  **Argument Structure as a Signal (Stable):** Awaiting new documents to apply this heuristic.\n8.  **Rhetorical Framing Matters (Stable):** Awaiting new documents to apply this heuristic.\n9.  **Clash of Canons (Stable):** My model of the interpretive clash is stable and awaits the government's merits brief.\n10. **Employ Precise Search Queries to Disambiguate Procedural Stages (Validated):** My internal reasoning confirms that my precise searches worked exactly as intended, not by finding the document, but by *proving its absence* from the available data. This validates the heuristic's power for generating both positive and negative evidence.\n11. **Negative Search Results Are Strong Evidence (Strongly Reinforced):** My reflection explicitly confirms this belief. The repeated failure to find the respondent's brief is not a neutral event; it is a high-confidence signal that the document is not yet available. This allows me to stop redundant searches and accurately model the state of the case.\n12. **Model the Procedural Timeline (Strongly Reinforced & Elevated):** My internal reasoning identified this as a critical knowledge gap. The inability to anticipate *when* a document might become available is a significant inefficiency. This belief is now elevated from a good idea to a high-priority strategic requirement. My next action is planned specifically to address this gap.\n13. **Pivot to Design-Level Inquiry When Task-Level Inquiry is Blocked (New):** This observation introduces a sophisticated new strategic principle. When the path to acquiring more task-specific information (\u03b8) is temporarily blocked (as it is by the missing brief), a highly effective action is to pivot towards improving my general model of the environment (D). By choosing to research SCOTUS procedural timelines, I am not directly solving the *Martin* case, but I am improving my ability to solve this case and all future cases more efficiently. This strategy maximizes the value of my actions even when facing information-gathering constraints."

They cite foundational cases like *Saucier v. Katz* and *Pearson v. Callahan*, which established and then made flexible the two-prong test for qualified immunity. They also reference cases like *Groh v. Ramirez* and *Messerschmidt v. Millender* concerning warrants and officer reasonableness.

For procedural rules, I should seek out official court sources, not analytical bulletins."

By Robert F. Williams Published: September 7, 2023 New Jersey New Jersey Montana Montana There are a\u00a0number of ways\u00a0in which the U.S. Constitution \u2014 and its interpretation by the Supreme Court \u2014 affects state constitutions and their interpretation by state courts. Probably the most important area right now is the interpretation of state constitutional rights. This explainer describes the relationship between federal and state constitutional law, discusses why decisions limiting federal rights can be consistent with expanded state constitutional rights, and details varying state court approaches to interpreting their constitutions. The Relationship Between Federal and State Constitutional Law The space for state courts to independently apply their state constitutions is\u00a0accordion-like, meaning it can expand or contract based on U.S. Supreme Court decisions. For example, decisions such as\u00a0Rucho v. Common Cause, which held that federal constitutional challenges to partisan gerrymandering were nonjusticiable, and\u00a0Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization, which overruled\u00a0Roe v. Wade\u00a0and held that there was no federal constitutional right to an abortion, represent a hands-off approach to federal constitutional rights interpretation, leaving these matters to the states and thus expanding state constitutional space. By contrast, the Supreme Court\u2019s Second Amendment ruling in\u00a0New York State Rifle & Pistol Association v. Bruen,\u00a0as well as\u00a0a\u00a0number\u00a0of\u00a0recent\u00a0federal constitutional religion decisions, represent a hands-on approach, taking these matters away from the states and thus narrowing state constitutional space. The Supreme Court can also leave state constitutional space when it rules against or minimizes federal constitutional rights in a single case rather than a whole category of cases. For example, a fact-specific search-and-seizure claim might fail in the Supreme Court under the applicable test but leave room for state courts to reach a more protective outcome under different facts as a matter of both federal and state constitutional law. Even where state constitutional space exists, however, a Supreme Court ruling limiting federal rights can still exert a \u201cgravitational force\u201d on state constitutional second looks at the matter. Therefore, the first step in arguing for a more protective state constitutional decision is to dispel this gravitational force. How Limiting Federal Rights Can Support Broader State Constitutional Protections Importantly, the Supreme Court has often expressed support, or at least tolerance (as it must), for state courts interpreting their constitutions to be more protective than its interpretations of the federal Constitution. For example, Justice Antonin Scalia, in a death penalty sentencing decision,\u00a0noted, \u201cThe state courts may experiment all they want with their own constitutions, and often do in the wake of this Court\u2019s decisions.\u201d Even though such statements are truisms, it cannot hurt to quote them to state courts deciding whether to interpret their constitutions to be more protective. Equally important is the fact that a state constitutional decision that is based on an \u201cadequate and independent state-law ground\u201d is insulated from Supreme Court review. Careful review of a Supreme Court majority opinion limiting or denying a federal right may reveal evidence that the Court was\u00a0underenforcing\u00a0the right because of federalism concerns about mandating a single national rule for the 50 states. Such reasoning can support arguments for stronger rights enforcement at the state level. For example, in the 1973 case of\u00a0San Antonio Independent School District v. Rodriguez, the Supreme Court rejected a claim of unequal public school funding, stating: Every claim that arises under the Equal Protection Clause has implications for the relationship between national and state power under our federal system. Questions of federalism are always inherent in the process of determining whether a State\u2019s laws are to be accorded the traditional presumption of constitutionality, or are to be subjected instead to rigorous judicial scrutiny. Many state courts are fully aware of this possible \u201cfederalism discount.\u201d For example, the New Jersey Supreme Court, also considering unequal public school funding within weeks of\u00a0Rodriguez,\u00a0observed, \u201cThere emerges from the [U.S. Supreme Court] majority opinion an evident reluctance to say that the Federal Constitution supplies single solutions by which all the States are bound.\u201d Another reason the Supreme Court may decline to impose a national constitutional rule is because of strategic concerns about how such a rule would operate in widely divergent states. As Texas Law professor Lawrence Sager has\u00a0noted: State judges confront institutional\u00a0environments and histories that vary dramatically from state to state, and that differ, in any one state, from the homogenized, abstracted national vision from which the Supreme Court is forced to operate. It is natural and appropriate that in fashioning constitutional rules the state judges\u2019 instrumental impulses and judgements differ. A good example of differing strategic concerns can be seen by comparing the approaches of the U.S. Supreme Court and the New Jersey Supreme Court to the warrantless search and seizure of household garbage left at the curb. In\u00a0California v. Greenwood, the U.S. Supreme Court rejected a claim that such searches violated the Fourth Amendment. The Court concluded that while \u201cindividual States may surely construe their own constitutions as imposing more stringent constraints on police conduct than does the Federal Constitution, . . . society as a whole possesses no such understanding.\u201d Several years later, the New Jersey Supreme Court reached a more protective result under its state constitution\u2019s Fourth Amendment analogue. The court\u00a0explained\u00a0that while the U.S. Supreme Court has to \u201ctake note of the disparity in warrant application procedures among the several states, and must consider whether a warrant requirement in that situation might overload the\u00a0procedure in any one state,\u201d in New Jersey, \u201cwe are fortunate to have . . . a procedure that allows for the speedy and reliable issuance of search warrants based on probable cause.\u201d For this reason, the state high court concluded, \u201cA warrant requirement is not so great a burden in New Jersey as it might be in other States.\u201d Finally, the fact that a U.S. Supreme Court decision was not unanimous can erode its persuasive force, and the arguments of the dissenters can appeal to state judges. For example, in establishing a state constitutional violation for partisan gerrymandering, the New Mexico Supreme Court\u00a0recently adopted\u00a0the test articulated by Justice Elena Kagan in her dissent in\u00a0Rucho. Interpreting State Constitutions Some state courts have established a set of criteria or factors they say they will apply when deciding whether to interpret their state constitutions to be more protective than the federal rights established by the U.S. Supreme Court. These criteria include, not surprisingly, differing text, constitutional history indicating higher protection, preexisting state law, and cases on the issue in other states. I have been\u00a0critical\u00a0of this approach because, among other things, it seems to give the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s approach a presumption of correctness that is misplaced given the likelihood of the Court\u2019s federalism deference, strategic concerns, and other matters mentioned above. But when bringing a case in such a state, it is wise to follow the criteria laid out by the court. Other state courts may have issued earlier decisions that interpret a state constitutional provision in lockstep with how the U.S. Supreme Court has interpreted the federal issue. While a lockstepping decision may be limited to a specific set of facts, state courts also often purport to adopt the federal constitutional doctrine in future cases. I have\u00a0argued\u00a0such a statement may not be considered a binding precedent because, among other things, a court cannot decide future controversies with unknown facts. Turning to the unique arguments available under state constitutions for a more rights-protective constitutional ruling, the first step is to consider the state constitutional text. Even if it is identical to the federal text, a court is free to interpret a state provision to be more protective. And slight variations in text can be very persuasive in making the case that a state constitutional provision should be interpreted differently than its federal counterpart. For example, several states have Eighth Amendment analogues that bar cruel\u00a0or\u00a0unusual punishment rather than cruel\u00a0and\u00a0unusual punishment. Moreover, some familiar constitutional rights are phrased very differently in state constitutions. For example, many First Amendment analogues have distinct language regarding free speech and religious guarantees. There are also many rights provisions in state constitutions that have no analogue in the federal Constitution. For example, some states protect incarcerated individuals from being treated with \u201cundue rigor,\u201d and numerous states have adopted state-level Equal Rights Amendments. Modern environmental provisions can be interpreted to vindicate public rights, while right-to-remedy and civil jury trial clauses have been deployed against special-interest tort reform laws. State constitutions also contain a wide variety of policy provisions on topics that could be covered by ordinary statutory law. These provisions can sometimes be used to establish rights. For example, many state constitutions include provisions on workers\u2019 compensation, implementing a \u201cGrand Bargain\u201d that eliminated tort remedies in exchange for administrative remedies. I have\u00a0argued\u00a0that these provisions can support workers\u2019 claims that an implementing statute unduly restricts eligibility requirements or benefit levels. In state constitutional law, it is also possible, where more than one rights provision is potentially applicable to a fact situation, to argue that not only do they apply individually, but they also\u00a0enhance each other. For example, where unequal allocations of education resources are challenged under state equality provisions, the existence of a right to education has been used by some courts to support a heightened level of judicial scrutiny. Likewise, in Montana, the state supreme court has justified enhanced search-and-seizure protections based in part on the state constitution\u2019s right to privacy. Another difference between state constitutions and their federal counterpart is that state constitutions are, by design, much more easily amended. Consequently, some textual provisions concerning rights may be layered, reflecting changes over the years. This calls for what has been referred to as\u00a0interconstitutionalism, requiring each of the changes to be considered. Finally, state constitutional rights provisions can be given context and even evidence of intent by state constitutional history: constitutional convention records, constitutional commission records and reports, the history of legislatively proposed amendments, and even newspaper articles and editorials. Since in all but one state, the voters must ratify state constitutional amendments and revisions, the courts typically search for the voters\u2019 intent or \u201cthe voice of the people.\u201d State constitutional history materials are often more recent, complete, and available than their federal counterpart but are subject to some of the\u00a0same problems. Layered provisions will have constitutional history for the original version as well for each change. State courts interpreting state constitutions apply various \u201ccanons\u201d of interpretation that are identical or similar to canons of statutory interpretation. \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 State constitutional law litigation may initially seem unfamiliar, but it really is just lawyers\u2019 work in texts, intent, case law, and interpretive doctrines. There are many more law review and treatise resources than were available in earlier generations. For the foreseeable future, state constitutional law will have to provide a \u201csecond best\u201d alternative to the Supreme Court\u2019s national rights protection. Robert F.

Related topics Labour reforms Investigations Compliance At a glance The Supreme Court overruled the Chevron deference doctrine, which had provided the framework for judicial review of federal agencies\u2019 formal interpretations of statutes for the past 40 years. The ruling came from the consolidated cases, Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo and Relentless, Inc v. Department of Commerce, and is expected to have profound implications for federal agencies and those subject to federal regulation. The Court held that under the Administrative Procedure Act, courts must exercise independent judgment in determining the meaning of statutory provisions, even ambiguous ones. This ruling has major implications for the operations of all three branches of government and for regulated entities, including increasing the likelihood of success for those challenging federal regulations and placing pressure on Congress to legislate with greater specificity. The ruling may increase regulatory uncertainty and limit the ability of businesses to confidently act in reliance on agency pronouncements. The Supreme Court\u2019s decision raises many agency-specific and industry-specific questions, with potential effects in areas of law including health care, food and drug, environmental, tax, securities, privacy, and telecommunications regulations. In a much-anticipated decision, the Supreme Court has overruled the Chevron deference doctrine, an administrative law precedent that provided the framework for judicial review of federal agencies\u2019 formal interpretations of statutes for the past 40 years. The Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in the consolidated cases, Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo and Relentless, Inc v. Department of Commerce, (Loper Bright), can be expected to have profound implications for federal agencies and those subject to federal regulation \u2013 which is to say, nearly everyone in the US. Under Chevron, a reviewing court was required to defer to a federal agency\u2019s reasonable interpretation of ambiguity in a statute administrated by the agency \u2013 a standard that led lower federal courts to rule for the government in the majority of challenges to agency rules and regulations. In the June 28, 2024 Loper Bright decision, a 6-3 Supreme Court majority abolished the Chevron doctrine. The Court held that, under the Administrative Procedure Act, courts must 'exercise independent judgment in determining the meaning of statutory provisions,' even ambiguous ones. The Court\u2019s ruling has major implications for the operations of all three branches of government and for regulated entities. Among other things, this blockbuster ruling: charges courts with supplying the interpretation of ambiguous statutory provisions, even where technical and scientific expertise may be implicated; increases the likelihood of success of those challenging federal regulations; limits executive agencies\u2019 ability to fill gaps in the laws or to address situations not expressly anticipated by Congress, and may cause agencies to proceed more cautiously and narrowly in adopting regulations; and places pressure on Congress to legislate with greater specificity (or at least to make express delegations of interpretative authority, where permissible). Reduced judicial deference to agency interpretations may also increase regulatory uncertainty and limit the ability of businesses to confidently act in reliance on agency pronouncements \u2013 particularly in the near term as both agencies and courts adjust to the post-Chevron legal landscape. Background and context The Chevron deference doctrine was articulated by Justice Stephens in Chevron USA, Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, 467 U.S. 837 (1984), a case involving a challenge to EPA regulations interpreting a term in the federal Clean Air Act. The Supreme Court set out a two-step test for courts reviewing an agency\u2019s construction of a statute it administers. At step one, the court asks 'whether Congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue.' If the meaning of the statute is 'unambiguously expressed,' then 'that is the end of the matter' because the agency and court must adhere to that. At step two, 'if the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue,' the court then asks 'whether the agency's answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute.' It is the second step that became known as 'Chevron deference,' as it called for courts to resist 'simply imposing their own construction of the statute' and instead to defer to an agency\u2019s reasonable construction of a statute when the statute failed to clearly express Congress\u2019s intent. Over the last 40 years, Chevron deference became a bedrock doctrine of administrative law, with federal district courts and appellate courts applying the test in tens of thousands of cases. And application of the test strongly favored agency interpretations. Studies have estimated that the agency prevails in more than three-quarters of such cases decided by federal courts of appeals and that proportion may be higher in federal district courts. As a result, under Chevron, executive branch agencies have played a central (and seemingly ever-expanding) role in interpreting federal regulatory statutes, which sometimes purposefully leave gaps for agencies to fill or simply do not anticipate all of the issues that may arise in their implementation and enforcement. Whether vesting such judgments and power in federal agencies is appropriate as a matter of law, policy, political accountability, or practicality has been a matter of continuing debate. In the last decade, there have been increasing calls to limit or overrule the Chevron standard in favor of more stringent judicial review. Last year, the Court granted certiorari to consider two circuit court decisions that applied the Chevron methodology to uphold a somewhat obscure National Marine Fisheries Service regulation. The regulation at issue requires fishing vessel owners, in some circumstances, to pay for an onboard observer to monitor compliance with federal fisheries regulations. In the lead case, Loper Bright, the D.C. Circuit found the underlying statute, the Magnuson-Stevens Act, silent on the question of whether vessel owners could be required to pay for a monitor. The court proceeded to Chevron step two where it deferred to the agency\u2019s interpretation, which it found to be reasonable. The Supreme Court\u2019s framing of the question presented signaled that the Court would look beyond the fishing vessel rules to decide the fate of the Chevron doctrine: 'Whether the Court should overrule Chevron or at least clarify that statutory silence does not constitute an ambiguity requiring deference to the agency.' The supreme court decision Now, the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in Loper Bright has resolved the question presented in no uncertain terms: 'Chevron is overruled.' Chief Justice Roberts, writing for the majority, found that the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) requires that result when it commands that courts decide 'all relevant questions of law' when reviewing an agency action. According to the Court, there is a 'best reading' of each statute, and it is the 'one the court, after applying all relevant interpretative tools, concludes is best.' The one exception is when 'a particular statute delegates authority to an agency consistent with constitutional limits,' but even then 'courts must respect the delegation, while ensuring that the agency acts within it.' The Court concluded that Chevron deference was an erroneous judicial invention that should not be protected by stare decisis. The Court explained, however, that its overruling of Chevron deference does not apply retrospectively: Cases that were decided in reliance on the overruled test, remain good law entitled to statutory stare decisis 'despite the Court\u2019s change in interpretive methodology.' While the majority opinion is grounded in the statutory requirements imposed on courts by the APA, a concurring opinion by Justice Thomas asserted that the same result is also constitutionally required based on separation-of-powers principles. In another concurrence, Justice Gorsuch wrote that the ruling reflects 'the proper application of the doctrine of stare decisis,' 'returning judges to interpretative rules that have guided federal courts since the Nation\u2019s founding.' In a dissenting opinion, Justice Kagan, joined by Justice Sotomayor and Justice Jackson, observed that regulatory laws often contain ambiguities and gaps, and that agencies are more likely than courts to have the subject-matter expertise necessary to determine how to read those statutes. The dissent expressed deep concern that the ruling gives the judiciary 'exclusive power over every open issue\u2014no matter how expertise-driven or policy-laden\u2014involving the meaning of regulatory law.' Implications for future litigation and the regulatory landscape Post-Chevron judicial review Opportunities for litigants? Loper Bright promises to create opportunities for those seeking to challenge regulations they believe are unreasonable, unsound, or inconsistent with congressional direction or intent. Regulatory statutes are frequently silent or unclear on issues critical to implementation and enforcement. In those cases, absent interpretive authority clearly and lawfully delegated to the agency, challengers will no longer have to overcome automatic deference to an agency\u2019s interpretation. Rather, litigants\u2019 task will be to persuade the reviewing court that the agency did not apply the 'best reading' of the underlying statute. How will federal courts determine the 'best reading' of statutes? Statutory ambiguity, gaps, and unanticipated developments are inevitable. Going forward, how will courts resolve questions about the 'best reading' of a federal statute? Loper Bright makes clear the power and responsibility for determining the best interpretation is the province of the courts, who should use 'all relevant interpretive tools' at their disposal (presumably referring to interpretive canons and other tools of statutory construction). Rejecting Chevron\u2019s precept that there could be permissible interpretations that are not what the court would have reached, the majority concluded 'in the business of statutory interpretation, if it is not the best, it is not permissible.' Agencies\u2019 power to persuade While Loper Bright forecloses the automatic deference afforded to agencies under Step Two of the Chevron analysis, it does not preclude courts from considering the persuasive power of an agency\u2019s views when determining the 'best reading' of a statute. The majority opinion cites approvingly to Skidmore v. Swift, 323 U.S. 134 (1944). Under Skidmore (which pre-dates the enactment of the APA), courts give no presumptive weight to agency interpretations but consider the agency\u2019s 'power to persuade.' Factors a court may consider in determining the persuasiveness of an agency\u2019s interpretation include the thoroughness of the agency\u2019s consideration, the validity of its reasoning, and its consistency with earlier and later pronouncements. This has long been the approach federal courts have taken to reviewing informal, non-binding interpretations issued by agencies, and we may see lower courts extending the Skidmore approach to agency regulations. The application of Skidmore may allow courts to continue to recognize, where appropriate, the persuasive power of an agency\u2019s expertise and experience. Application of the major questions doctrine and non-delegation doctrine Loper Bright acknowledges that a statute may contain an express delegation of authority to an agency to interpret and implement particular provisions. According to the ruling, courts should defer to such delegations, provided that the agency is properly acting within the scope of its lawful delegation. Both the major questions doctrine and the non-delegation doctrine limit the scope of delegations, which is likely to figure prominently in future litigation. The major questions doctrine prevents agencies from undertaking regulation with 'vast economic and political significance' unless Congress has in clear terms expressly delegated that power to the agency. See, eg, West Virginia v. EPA, 597 U.S. 697 (2022). The non-delegation doctrine enforces the constitutional separation of powers between the legislative and executive branches by imposing limits on what lawmaking powers Congress may delegate to administrative agencies (Congress must provide agencies with an 'intelligible principle' upon which to base regulations). The doctrine has rarely been applied by federal courts in recent years, but may be a basis, going forward, by which courts seek to limit excessive delegation of legislative power to executive branch agencies. The scope and contours of these doctrines are likely to be subjects of future litigation. Post-Chevron Regulatory Landscape More uncertainty for regulated entities? Regulatory certainty and stability are important to many companies in developing strategic plans, investing, mitigating risks, and other important business decisions. To varying extents, businesses rely on agency regulations to establish standards governing their business activities and delineate how federal laws will be enforced in specific contexts and circumstances. The Chevron deference doctrine provided some assurance to regulated entities that a reviewing court would likely uphold an agency\u2019s reasonable construction of a statute the agency was charged with implementing. One result of the elimination of Chevron deference, at least initially, likely will be 'heightened uncertainty' regarding the validity of agency regulations. How a reviewing court will rule, absent an effective presumption of agency correctness, may be difficult to predict. And the results on review may vary with the court or judge when the question boils down to 'what is the best construction or application of the statute?' The Supreme Court has overruled Chevron, but it has not provided clear or specific direction about what comes next. What approach or standard should lower courts apply to resolve uncertainty that persists after the traditional tools of statutory construction have been applied? Until that question is resolved, federal courts of appeals and district courts may apply different approaches and analyses, fostering uncertainty \u2013 and possibly increased forum shopping \u2013 until a consistent approach emerges. At a minimum, it fair to expect a significant transition period as lower courts determine the methods they will rely upon. Significant implications for all three branches Loper Bright will have consequences for the de facto roles and operations of all three branches of the federal government. Perhaps most clearly, the decision shifts power and responsibility for interpreting federal statutes from the executive to the judicial branch. But, Marbury v. Madison notwithstanding, significant questions are likely to arise as to courts\u2019 capacity to determine 'what the law is' in specialized areas of the law, absent clear and specific congressional direction. In a post-Chevron environment, executive agencies may be more circumspect in adopting regulations, filling legislative gaps, and taking regulatory actions to address situations and developments that Congress did not anticipate or address. Finally, Loper Bright arguably calls for greater clarity and specificity from Congress in the statutes it enacts. This may be a tall order for Congress as it is presently constituted and resourced\u2014and may create heightened demand for input from outside experts. At least in some instances, the ruling may impel more and clearer congressional directions to federal agencies regarding how statutes are to be implemented. And at a minimum, it may prompt more explicit delegations of interpretive authority to agencies with subject-matter expertise when Congress wants to ensure that agencies are empowered to address particular gaps in the laws.

L. Rev. 1300 Constitutional Remedies: In One Era and Out the Other Richard H. Fallon, Story Professor of Law, Harvard Law School Volume 136 Issue 5 March 2023 See full issue Download See Footnotes Abstract Despite the ringing dictum of Marbury v. Madison that \u201cevery right, when withheld, must have a remedy,\u201d rights to remedies have always had a precarious constitutional status. For over one hundred years, the norm was that victims of ongoing constitutional violations had rights to injunctive relief. But the Constitution nowhere expressly prescribes that norm, and recent Supreme Court decisions, involving suits for injunctions and damages alike, have left the constitutional connection between rights and remedies more attenuated than ever before. This Article explores the conceptual and doctrinal connections between constitutional rights and entitlements to judicial remedies. Whole Woman\u2019s Health v. Jackson\u00a0\u2014\u00a0which largely vindicated Texas\u2019s strategy for insulating an antiabortion law from judicial challenge via suits for injunctions\u00a0\u2014\u00a0furnishes the Article\u2019s primary window into the current doctrinal landscape. But the Article\u2019s perspective is broadly historical. It assumes throughout that we cannot understand the present law without understanding the background from which it developed and, in increasingly important respects, from which it now deviates. The Article\u2019s central thesis combines empirical and normative aspects: Although the modern Supreme Court has wielded separation of powers arguments to truncate constitutional remedies, the Court\u2019s premises are mistaken. The Constitution frequently, though not invariably, requires effective remedies for constitutional rights violations. When Congress fails to authorize such remedies, nothing in the Constitution\u2019s history or tradition precludes a role for the Supreme Court in devising remedies that are necessary to enforce substantive rights. If we have entered an era in which a majority of the Justices believe otherwise, the situation is a deeply regrettable one in which the concept of a constitutional right will be cheapened. Introduction \u201cIt is a settled and invariable principle,\u201d Chief Justice Marshall once wrote, \u201cthat every right, when withheld, must have a remedy.\u201d1 Not quite. Although some view the idea of a substantive constitutional right without a remedy as oxymoronic,2 rights to remedies have always had a precarious constitutional status, which the Supreme Court has lately subjected to multifaceted subversion. The rubric of rights to constitutional remedies encompasses diverse elements, including (1) the jurisdiction of a court to hear a claim, (2) the existence of a cause of action,3 and (3) the availability of judicial relief. But the complex interrelationships among these elements should not obscure the practical and conceptual dependence of constitutional rights on mechanisms for their enforcement.4 The recent decision in Whole Woman\u2019s Health v. Jackson5 exemplifies the Supreme Court\u2019s accelerating attenuation of the relationship between substantive constitutional rights and rights to remedies. Jackson arose from Texas\u2019s attempt to defeat suits for injunctions against an antiabortion law. In a ruling that epitomizes a sea change in the law of constitutional remedies, the Court, with Justice Gorsuch writing for the majority,6 allowed Texas largely to succeed in its ambition, even as the majority assumed that the Constitution guaranteed rights of abortion access. (That assumption proved evanescent when, six months after its decision in Jackson, the Court overruled Roe v. Wade7 in Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization.8) Legal and even constitutional barriers to the enforcement of rights are familiar in some contexts. Sovereign immunity normally bars unconsented suits against both the federal government and the states, including for constitutional violations.9 When sovereign immunity is combined with the \u201cofficial immunity\u201d of government officers such as police and prosecutors, there are many cases in which victims of past constitutional violations receive no financial compensation.10 By contrast, in cases of ongoing constitutional violations, such as school segregation or threats to enforce unconstitutional statutes, courts, for well over one hundred years, have much more routinely issued injunctions necessary to make constitutional rights meaningful in practice.11 The Supreme Court\u2019s decision in the Jackson case marked a break in that pattern. The Texas Heartbeat Act,12 also known as S.B. 8, combined three elements. First, in defiance of Roe and Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey,13 S.B. 8 purported to ban abortion as soon as fetal cardiac activity could be detected.14 Second, to avoid preenforcement suits, S.B. 8 removed prosecutorial responsibility from the state\u2019s Attorney General and other executive officials.15 Instead, it authorized private citizens to bring civil actions against anyone who performed or abetted abortions.16 Because private citizens can rarely violate the Constitution under the \u201cstate action doctrine,\u201d17 Texas hoped to leave those who wished to procure, abet, or perform abortions with no one to sue. The strictures of standing doctrine also posed obstacles to suits against all potential private enforcers of the Heartbeat Act.18 Third, S.B. 8 subjected anyone who performed, aided, or abetted abortions to potentially draconian, multiple penalties.19 Unwilling to perform abortions prohibited by S.B. 8 without the protection of a court order, Texas abortion providers quickly sought federal injunctions against the statute\u2019s enforcement.20 In Jackson, the Supreme Court framed the question before it as whether the challengers had adequately stated claims for relief against a private Texas citizen, the state\u2019s Attorney General, a state judge, a court clerk, and various officials responsible for medical licensing.21 The Court\u2019s majority ruled that the plaintiffs lacked standing to sue the private defendant and the Texas Attorney General,22 and that sovereign immunity barred suit against Texas judges and clerks,23 but it found that medical licensing officials retained a role in enforcing S.B. 8\u2019s substantive prohibitions and were therefore suable for injunctions under a legal theory long associated with Ex parte Young.24 The ensuing headline was that the challengers had a federal right to challenge S.B. 8 via a suit against Texas \u201clicensing officials.\u201d25 But the Texas Supreme Court\u00a0\u2014\u00a0which is the ultimate authority on the meaning of Texas law26\u00a0\u2014\u00a0subsequently held that those officials had no authority to enforce S.B. 8.27 With that ruling, the plaintiffs\u2019 hope for an injunction dissolved. It seems doubtful, moreover, that an injunction solely against licensing officials would have emboldened Texas abortion providers to violate S.B. 8. Under doctrines of claim and issue preclusion and precedent, a lower federal court\u2019s decision to award such an injunction would probably not have bound the private parties that S.B.\u00a08 empowered to bring suits for damages and other civil penalties.28 The threat of private actions to enforce S.B. 8 in the Texas state courts, including ones brought after an anticipated overruling of Roe and Casey, would thus have remained. In response to Justice Sotomayor\u2019s dissenting protest that the Supreme Court should not permit Texas to evade suits for effectual injunctive relief against a statute that was plainly unconstitutional under Roe and Casey,29 Justice Gorsuch emphasized that the state had not wholly insulated S.B. 8 from challenge.30 Apart from the suit against licensing officials that the Court believed to be available, Justice Gorsuch noted that S.B. 8 might be challengeable in preenforcement suits for injunctions in Texas state court31\u00a0\u2014\u00a0though he did not appear to condition the Court\u2019s upholding of S.B. 8 on that uncertain possibility.32 In any event, Justice Gorsuch wrote, any parties who were sued for violating S.B. 8 could assert their constitutional rights as defenses in the actions against them.33 The right of defendants to argue that a statute being enforced against them violates the Constitution is indeed an important, constitutionally mandated component of the relationship between substantive constitutional rights and rights to remedies. Under the Constitution\u2019s Supremacy Clause, courts must entertain properly presented constitutional defenses.34 But reliance on that safeguard requires violating a statute and taking one\u2019s chances that a constitutional argument will prevail. That can be a risky strategy in lots of contexts and was especially risky for the plaintiffs in Jackson because of the prospect that the Supreme Court might overrule Roe and Casey. It was to alleviate the chilling effects of threatened criminal and civil enforcement actions that the modern law of constitutional remedies had evolved to allow suits for injunctions as the norm.35 The case- and abortion-transcending significance of Jackson lies in the Supreme Court majority\u2019s treatment of that norm. On the most plausible reading, Jackson holds that there is no right to sue for an injunction against the enforcement of a statute even when it creates, and is designed to create, a chilling effect on the exercise of constitutional rights\u00a0\u2014\u00a0at least, that is, when the right holders could, in theory, assert their rights as a defense against an enforcement action. If so, Jackson possesses enormous consequence. In addition to inviting other states to replicate Texas\u2019s strategy in efforts to chill the exercise of constitutional rights,36 Jackson pairs with the Supreme Court\u2019s 2015 decision in Armstrong v. Exceptional Child Center, Inc.37\u00a0\u2014\u00a0which held that the Supremacy Clause does not directly create a federal right to sue to enjoin the enforcement of unconstitutional state statutes38\u00a0\u2014\u00a0to raise questions about whether parties ever have a constitutional right to equitable relief. If no constitutional mandate underlies the traditional practices of courts of equity in enjoining constitutional violations, then causes of action to sue for injunctions apparently exist only insofar as states choose to grant them as a matter of state law and Congress chooses to tolerate them as a matter of federal law. For some parties who rely on injunctions to vindicate their substantive rights, moreover, defense against an enforcement action is not even a theoretical alternative. Consider, for example, someone who is subjected to unconstitutional prayer in a public school, or who is denied welfare benefits or fired from a job for unconstitutional reasons, or even the plaintiffs in Brown v. Board of Education,39 who experienced racial segregation. Does the Constitution guarantee none of them rights to sue for injunctions or other remedies adequate to enforce their substantive rights? At the current time, most would-be plaintiffs who believe that state officials have violated their constitutional rights have statutory rights to sue for injunctions under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a01983.40 But what would happen if Congress took away statutory rights to sue to enjoin enforcement of unconstitutional statutes? Would there be a constitutionally mandated right to an injunction or other efficacious remedies? Thirty years ago, I would have answered confidently that the answer to this question was yes. Closer to the present but prior to Armstrong and now Jackson, I still would have thought that the affirmative argument would likely convince a majority of the Justices. But now the argument that there is a constitutional right to effective injunctive relief against ongoing constitutional violations, even when there is no opportunity to vindicate substantive constitutional rights through a defense against an enforcement action, confronts gathering precedent-based headwinds. In the view of some, it may be an ample response that Congress is unlikely, as a political matter, to preclude effective injunctive remedies for states\u2019 ongoing violations of constitutional norms such as those barring segregation in public education,41 school prayer,42 or employment discrimination.43 Viewing political developments as significantly unpredictable, I am less sanguine. But whatever one\u2019s political prognostications, Jackson provides a reminder that major gaps can exist\u00a0\u2014 sometimes because legislative bodies wish to create them\u00a0\u2014\u00a0between constitutional rights and the remedies that would be necessary to enforce those rights in practice. Jackson thus provides an occasion for considering broad questions both about where the law of constitutional remedies currently stands and about how it is likely to change in the near future. Although much of my analysis takes Jackson as its point of departure, this Article highlights Jackson\u2019s connection to other recent doctrinal developments, including the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in the same Term to make suits for damages against federal officials who violate constitutional rights nearly impossible to prosecute successfully.44 Looking back at the 1971 decision in Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of Federal Bureau of Narcotics,45 which had first recognized a right of plaintiffs to sue federal officials for damages,46 the Court indicated in Egbert v. Boule47 that \u201cif we were called to decide Bivens today, we would decline to discover any implied causes of action in the Constitution.\u201d48 In addressing questions about the present state and likely future of the law of constitutional remedies, this Article relies on two assumptions. First, we cannot understand what substantive constitutional rights are, or what it means to have a substantive right, without attention to the extent\u00a0\u2014\u00a0if any\u00a0\u2014\u00a0of available and possibly constitutionally guaranteed remedies. Second, we cannot understand the current law defining the relationship between substantive constitutional rights and rights of access to courts to vindicate them without understanding the historical and constitutional background from which the current law developed and, in increasingly important respects, from which the current law now deviates. Against the background of those premises, this Article advances a single, central argument that combines empirical and normative aspects: shaping the right-remedy relationship is a crucial lawmaking function that has historically been shared between Congress and the courts, especially the Supreme Court. Contrary to some of the Court\u2019s critics, the relationship between rights and remedies is not conceptually determinate.49 One cannot deduce entitlements to particular remedies directly from the concept of a right without reliance on other premises and consideration of multiple contingent factors.50 At the same time, contrary to some originalist-textualist debunkers of the law of constitutional remedies as it existed prior to cases such as Armstrong and Jackson,51 nothing in the Constitution\u2019s history or tradition mandates that the Supreme Court must leave the provision of remedies that are necessary to the effective enforcement of substantive rights entirely to Congress. Nor is Congress\u2019s authority to grant or withhold remedies for constitutional violations, sometimes including damages and injunctions, wholly unconstrained. If we have entered an era in which a majority of the Justices believe otherwise, the situation is, in my view, a deeply regrettable one, which will cheapen what it means to have a constitutional right.52 Rights that exist in name will increasingly fall vulnerable to flouting in the absence of political commitments to enforcing them. We also risk erosion of the rule-of-law ideal that the government and its officials should be accountable for their violations of law in actions before the courts.53 Although some of my concerns and theses in this Article are familiar, my aim is to achieve a relatively panoptic perspective on historical trends and normative themes in the law of constitutional remedies, to bring criticisms of the Supreme Court\u2019s restrictions of available remedies up to date, and to forecast likely future developments\u00a0\u2014\u00a0a number of which I find alarming. This Article unfolds as follows. Part I traces the emergence of what I call the traditional law of constitutional remedies from the Founding era through the latter part of the twentieth century. It also offers a brief normative defense, rooted in the ideal of the rule of law, of the doctrine that developed during this period. Part II identifies the beginnings of a revisionary movement in the late twentieth century, partly but not entirely driven by the Supreme Court\u2019s increasing (but never complete) commitment to originalist and textualist interpretive methodologies. Part III examines the reasoning of the Court\u2019s recent decision in Whole Woman\u2019s Health v. Jackson. Part IV probes the likely implications of Jackson and other recent decisions for a number of important, looming issues concerning the relationship of substantive rights to constitutional remedies. Jackson, I suggest, is unlikely to mark the culmination of the Court\u2019s project in making the availability of remedies for constitutional violations less a matter of constitutional right than a subject for political judgment and limitation both by state legislatures\u00a0\u2014\u00a0as in Jackson\u00a0\u2014 and by Congress. Part V considers and rejects the suggestion, offered by the Court in Jackson, that its recent decisions restricting constitutional remedies reflect a stance of disciplined restraint and deference to Congress under the separation of powers. The Court, Part V argues, retains and sometimes aggressively employs a variety of nondeferential levers to shape the law of constitutional remedies to its preferences. Part VI concludes with reflections on constitutional change and likely developments in the long-term future. Footnotes Hide show ^ Marbury v.

Arkansas, 495 U.S. 149, 158 (1990))), with Susan B. Anthony List v. Driehaus, 573 U.S. 149, 164 (2014) (risk must be \u201csubstantial\u201d). Under this formula, it may be difficult to establish that any particular private citizen is sufficiently likely to bring an enforcement action against any particular plaintiff to be causally responsible for the plaintiff\u2019s injury and to show that an injunction against particular defendants would remedy the injury.

By Robert F. Williams Published: September 7, 2023 New Jersey New Jersey Montana Montana There are a\u00a0number of ways\u00a0in which the U.S. Constitution \u2014 and its interpretation by the Supreme Court \u2014 affects state constitutions and their interpretation by state courts. Probably the most important area right now is the interpretation of state constitutional rights. This explainer describes the relationship between federal and state constitutional law, discusses why decisions limiting federal rights can be consistent with expanded state constitutional rights, and details varying state court approaches to interpreting their constitutions. The Relationship Between Federal and State Constitutional Law The space for state courts to independently apply their state constitutions is\u00a0accordion-like, meaning it can expand or contract based on U.S. Supreme Court decisions. For example, decisions such as\u00a0Rucho v. Common Cause, which held that federal constitutional challenges to partisan gerrymandering were nonjusticiable, and\u00a0Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization, which overruled\u00a0Roe v. Wade\u00a0and held that there was no federal constitutional right to an abortion, represent a hands-off approach to federal constitutional rights interpretation, leaving these matters to the states and thus expanding state constitutional space. By contrast, the Supreme Court\u2019s Second Amendment ruling in\u00a0New York State Rifle & Pistol Association v. Bruen,\u00a0as well as\u00a0a\u00a0number\u00a0of\u00a0recent\u00a0federal constitutional religion decisions, represent a hands-on approach, taking these matters away from the states and thus narrowing state constitutional space. The Supreme Court can also leave state constitutional space when it rules against or minimizes federal constitutional rights in a single case rather than a whole category of cases. For example, a fact-specific search-and-seizure claim might fail in the Supreme Court under the applicable test but leave room for state courts to reach a more protective outcome under different facts as a matter of both federal and state constitutional law. Even where state constitutional space exists, however, a Supreme Court ruling limiting federal rights can still exert a \u201cgravitational force\u201d on state constitutional second looks at the matter. Therefore, the first step in arguing for a more protective state constitutional decision is to dispel this gravitational force. How Limiting Federal Rights Can Support Broader State Constitutional Protections Importantly, the Supreme Court has often expressed support, or at least tolerance (as it must), for state courts interpreting their constitutions to be more protective than its interpretations of the federal Constitution. For example, Justice Antonin Scalia, in a death penalty sentencing decision,\u00a0noted, \u201cThe state courts may experiment all they want with their own constitutions, and often do in the wake of this Court\u2019s decisions.\u201d Even though such statements are truisms, it cannot hurt to quote them to state courts deciding whether to interpret their constitutions to be more protective. Equally important is the fact that a state constitutional decision that is based on an \u201cadequate and independent state-law ground\u201d is insulated from Supreme Court review. Careful review of a Supreme Court majority opinion limiting or denying a federal right may reveal evidence that the Court was\u00a0underenforcing\u00a0the right because of federalism concerns about mandating a single national rule for the 50 states. Such reasoning can support arguments for stronger rights enforcement at the state level. For example, in the 1973 case of\u00a0San Antonio Independent School District v. Rodriguez, the Supreme Court rejected a claim of unequal public school funding, stating: Every claim that arises under the Equal Protection Clause has implications for the relationship between national and state power under our federal system. Questions of federalism are always inherent in the process of determining whether a State\u2019s laws are to be accorded the traditional presumption of constitutionality, or are to be subjected instead to rigorous judicial scrutiny. Many state courts are fully aware of this possible \u201cfederalism discount.\u201d For example, the New Jersey Supreme Court, also considering unequal public school funding within weeks of\u00a0Rodriguez,\u00a0observed, \u201cThere emerges from the [U.S. Supreme Court] majority opinion an evident reluctance to say that the Federal Constitution supplies single solutions by which all the States are bound.\u201d Another reason the Supreme Court may decline to impose a national constitutional rule is because of strategic concerns about how such a rule would operate in widely divergent states. As Texas Law professor Lawrence Sager has\u00a0noted: State judges confront institutional\u00a0environments and histories that vary dramatically from state to state, and that differ, in any one state, from the homogenized, abstracted national vision from which the Supreme Court is forced to operate. It is natural and appropriate that in fashioning constitutional rules the state judges\u2019 instrumental impulses and judgements differ. A good example of differing strategic concerns can be seen by comparing the approaches of the U.S. Supreme Court and the New Jersey Supreme Court to the warrantless search and seizure of household garbage left at the curb. In\u00a0California v. Greenwood, the U.S. Supreme Court rejected a claim that such searches violated the Fourth Amendment. The Court concluded that while \u201cindividual States may surely construe their own constitutions as imposing more stringent constraints on police conduct than does the Federal Constitution, . . . society as a whole possesses no such understanding.\u201d Several years later, the New Jersey Supreme Court reached a more protective result under its state constitution\u2019s Fourth Amendment analogue. The court\u00a0explained\u00a0that while the U.S. Supreme Court has to \u201ctake note of the disparity in warrant application procedures among the several states, and must consider whether a warrant requirement in that situation might overload the\u00a0procedure in any one state,\u201d in New Jersey, \u201cwe are fortunate to have . . . a procedure that allows for the speedy and reliable issuance of search warrants based on probable cause.\u201d For this reason, the state high court concluded, \u201cA warrant requirement is not so great a burden in New Jersey as it might be in other States.\u201d Finally, the fact that a U.S. Supreme Court decision was not unanimous can erode its persuasive force, and the arguments of the dissenters can appeal to state judges. For example, in establishing a state constitutional violation for partisan gerrymandering, the New Mexico Supreme Court\u00a0recently adopted\u00a0the test articulated by Justice Elena Kagan in her dissent in\u00a0Rucho. Interpreting State Constitutions Some state courts have established a set of criteria or factors they say they will apply when deciding whether to interpret their state constitutions to be more protective than the federal rights established by the U.S. Supreme Court. These criteria include, not surprisingly, differing text, constitutional history indicating higher protection, preexisting state law, and cases on the issue in other states. I have been\u00a0critical\u00a0of this approach because, among other things, it seems to give the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s approach a presumption of correctness that is misplaced given the likelihood of the Court\u2019s federalism deference, strategic concerns, and other matters mentioned above. But when bringing a case in such a state, it is wise to follow the criteria laid out by the court. Other state courts may have issued earlier decisions that interpret a state constitutional provision in lockstep with how the U.S. Supreme Court has interpreted the federal issue. While a lockstepping decision may be limited to a specific set of facts, state courts also often purport to adopt the federal constitutional doctrine in future cases. I have\u00a0argued\u00a0such a statement may not be considered a binding precedent because, among other things, a court cannot decide future controversies with unknown facts. Turning to the unique arguments available under state constitutions for a more rights-protective constitutional ruling, the first step is to consider the state constitutional text. Even if it is identical to the federal text, a court is free to interpret a state provision to be more protective. And slight variations in text can be very persuasive in making the case that a state constitutional provision should be interpreted differently than its federal counterpart. For example, several states have Eighth Amendment analogues that bar cruel\u00a0or\u00a0unusual punishment rather than cruel\u00a0and\u00a0unusual punishment. Moreover, some familiar constitutional rights are phrased very differently in state constitutions. For example, many First Amendment analogues have distinct language regarding free speech and religious guarantees. There are also many rights provisions in state constitutions that have no analogue in the federal Constitution. For example, some states protect incarcerated individuals from being treated with \u201cundue rigor,\u201d and numerous states have adopted state-level Equal Rights Amendments. Modern environmental provisions can be interpreted to vindicate public rights, while right-to-remedy and civil jury trial clauses have been deployed against special-interest tort reform laws. State constitutions also contain a wide variety of policy provisions on topics that could be covered by ordinary statutory law. These provisions can sometimes be used to establish rights. For example, many state constitutions include provisions on workers\u2019 compensation, implementing a \u201cGrand Bargain\u201d that eliminated tort remedies in exchange for administrative remedies. I have\u00a0argued\u00a0that these provisions can support workers\u2019 claims that an implementing statute unduly restricts eligibility requirements or benefit levels. In state constitutional law, it is also possible, where more than one rights provision is potentially applicable to a fact situation, to argue that not only do they apply individually, but they also\u00a0enhance each other. For example, where unequal allocations of education resources are challenged under state equality provisions, the existence of a right to education has been used by some courts to support a heightened level of judicial scrutiny. Likewise, in Montana, the state supreme court has justified enhanced search-and-seizure protections based in part on the state constitution\u2019s right to privacy. Another difference between state constitutions and their federal counterpart is that state constitutions are, by design, much more easily amended. Consequently, some textual provisions concerning rights may be layered, reflecting changes over the years. This calls for what has been referred to as\u00a0interconstitutionalism, requiring each of the changes to be considered. Finally, state constitutional rights provisions can be given context and even evidence of intent by state constitutional history: constitutional convention records, constitutional commission records and reports, the history of legislatively proposed amendments, and even newspaper articles and editorials. Since in all but one state, the voters must ratify state constitutional amendments and revisions, the courts typically search for the voters\u2019 intent or \u201cthe voice of the people.\u201d State constitutional history materials are often more recent, complete, and available than their federal counterpart but are subject to some of the\u00a0same problems. Layered provisions will have constitutional history for the original version as well for each change. State courts interpreting state constitutions apply various \u201ccanons\u201d of interpretation that are identical or similar to canons of statutory interpretation. \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 State constitutional law litigation may initially seem unfamiliar, but it really is just lawyers\u2019 work in texts, intent, case law, and interpretive doctrines. There are many more law review and treatise resources than were available in earlier generations. For the foreseeable future, state constitutional law will have to provide a \u201csecond best\u201d alternative to the Supreme Court\u2019s national rights protection. Robert F.

Related topics Labour reforms Investigations Compliance At a glance The Supreme Court overruled the Chevron deference doctrine, which had provided the framework for judicial review of federal agencies\u2019 formal interpretations of statutes for the past 40 years. The ruling came from the consolidated cases, Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo and Relentless, Inc v. Department of Commerce, and is expected to have profound implications for federal agencies and those subject to federal regulation. The Court held that under the Administrative Procedure Act, courts must exercise independent judgment in determining the meaning of statutory provisions, even ambiguous ones. This ruling has major implications for the operations of all three branches of government and for regulated entities, including increasing the likelihood of success for those challenging federal regulations and placing pressure on Congress to legislate with greater specificity. The ruling may increase regulatory uncertainty and limit the ability of businesses to confidently act in reliance on agency pronouncements. The Supreme Court\u2019s decision raises many agency-specific and industry-specific questions, with potential effects in areas of law including health care, food and drug, environmental, tax, securities, privacy, and telecommunications regulations. In a much-anticipated decision, the Supreme Court has overruled the Chevron deference doctrine, an administrative law precedent that provided the framework for judicial review of federal agencies\u2019 formal interpretations of statutes for the past 40 years. The Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in the consolidated cases, Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo and Relentless, Inc v. Department of Commerce, (Loper Bright), can be expected to have profound implications for federal agencies and those subject to federal regulation \u2013 which is to say, nearly everyone in the US. Under Chevron, a reviewing court was required to defer to a federal agency\u2019s reasonable interpretation of ambiguity in a statute administrated by the agency \u2013 a standard that led lower federal courts to rule for the government in the majority of challenges to agency rules and regulations. In the June 28, 2024 Loper Bright decision, a 6-3 Supreme Court majority abolished the Chevron doctrine. The Court held that, under the Administrative Procedure Act, courts must 'exercise independent judgment in determining the meaning of statutory provisions,' even ambiguous ones. The Court\u2019s ruling has major implications for the operations of all three branches of government and for regulated entities. Among other things, this blockbuster ruling: charges courts with supplying the interpretation of ambiguous statutory provisions, even where technical and scientific expertise may be implicated; increases the likelihood of success of those challenging federal regulations; limits executive agencies\u2019 ability to fill gaps in the laws or to address situations not expressly anticipated by Congress, and may cause agencies to proceed more cautiously and narrowly in adopting regulations; and places pressure on Congress to legislate with greater specificity (or at least to make express delegations of interpretative authority, where permissible). Reduced judicial deference to agency interpretations may also increase regulatory uncertainty and limit the ability of businesses to confidently act in reliance on agency pronouncements \u2013 particularly in the near term as both agencies and courts adjust to the post-Chevron legal landscape. Background and context The Chevron deference doctrine was articulated by Justice Stephens in Chevron USA, Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, 467 U.S. 837 (1984), a case involving a challenge to EPA regulations interpreting a term in the federal Clean Air Act. The Supreme Court set out a two-step test for courts reviewing an agency\u2019s construction of a statute it administers. At step one, the court asks 'whether Congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue.' If the meaning of the statute is 'unambiguously expressed,' then 'that is the end of the matter' because the agency and court must adhere to that. At step two, 'if the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue,' the court then asks 'whether the agency's answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute.' It is the second step that became known as 'Chevron deference,' as it called for courts to resist 'simply imposing their own construction of the statute' and instead to defer to an agency\u2019s reasonable construction of a statute when the statute failed to clearly express Congress\u2019s intent. Over the last 40 years, Chevron deference became a bedrock doctrine of administrative law, with federal district courts and appellate courts applying the test in tens of thousands of cases. And application of the test strongly favored agency interpretations. Studies have estimated that the agency prevails in more than three-quarters of such cases decided by federal courts of appeals and that proportion may be higher in federal district courts. As a result, under Chevron, executive branch agencies have played a central (and seemingly ever-expanding) role in interpreting federal regulatory statutes, which sometimes purposefully leave gaps for agencies to fill or simply do not anticipate all of the issues that may arise in their implementation and enforcement. Whether vesting such judgments and power in federal agencies is appropriate as a matter of law, policy, political accountability, or practicality has been a matter of continuing debate. In the last decade, there have been increasing calls to limit or overrule the Chevron standard in favor of more stringent judicial review. Last year, the Court granted certiorari to consider two circuit court decisions that applied the Chevron methodology to uphold a somewhat obscure National Marine Fisheries Service regulation. The regulation at issue requires fishing vessel owners, in some circumstances, to pay for an onboard observer to monitor compliance with federal fisheries regulations. In the lead case, Loper Bright, the D.C. Circuit found the underlying statute, the Magnuson-Stevens Act, silent on the question of whether vessel owners could be required to pay for a monitor. The court proceeded to Chevron step two where it deferred to the agency\u2019s interpretation, which it found to be reasonable. The Supreme Court\u2019s framing of the question presented signaled that the Court would look beyond the fishing vessel rules to decide the fate of the Chevron doctrine: 'Whether the Court should overrule Chevron or at least clarify that statutory silence does not constitute an ambiguity requiring deference to the agency.' The supreme court decision Now, the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in Loper Bright has resolved the question presented in no uncertain terms: 'Chevron is overruled.' Chief Justice Roberts, writing for the majority, found that the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) requires that result when it commands that courts decide 'all relevant questions of law' when reviewing an agency action. According to the Court, there is a 'best reading' of each statute, and it is the 'one the court, after applying all relevant interpretative tools, concludes is best.' The one exception is when 'a particular statute delegates authority to an agency consistent with constitutional limits,' but even then 'courts must respect the delegation, while ensuring that the agency acts within it.' The Court concluded that Chevron deference was an erroneous judicial invention that should not be protected by stare decisis. The Court explained, however, that its overruling of Chevron deference does not apply retrospectively: Cases that were decided in reliance on the overruled test, remain good law entitled to statutory stare decisis 'despite the Court\u2019s change in interpretive methodology.' While the majority opinion is grounded in the statutory requirements imposed on courts by the APA, a concurring opinion by Justice Thomas asserted that the same result is also constitutionally required based on separation-of-powers principles. In another concurrence, Justice Gorsuch wrote that the ruling reflects 'the proper application of the doctrine of stare decisis,' 'returning judges to interpretative rules that have guided federal courts since the Nation\u2019s founding.' In a dissenting opinion, Justice Kagan, joined by Justice Sotomayor and Justice Jackson, observed that regulatory laws often contain ambiguities and gaps, and that agencies are more likely than courts to have the subject-matter expertise necessary to determine how to read those statutes. The dissent expressed deep concern that the ruling gives the judiciary 'exclusive power over every open issue\u2014no matter how expertise-driven or policy-laden\u2014involving the meaning of regulatory law.' Implications for future litigation and the regulatory landscape Post-Chevron judicial review Opportunities for litigants? Loper Bright promises to create opportunities for those seeking to challenge regulations they believe are unreasonable, unsound, or inconsistent with congressional direction or intent. Regulatory statutes are frequently silent or unclear on issues critical to implementation and enforcement. In those cases, absent interpretive authority clearly and lawfully delegated to the agency, challengers will no longer have to overcome automatic deference to an agency\u2019s interpretation. Rather, litigants\u2019 task will be to persuade the reviewing court that the agency did not apply the 'best reading' of the underlying statute. How will federal courts determine the 'best reading' of statutes? Statutory ambiguity, gaps, and unanticipated developments are inevitable. Going forward, how will courts resolve questions about the 'best reading' of a federal statute? Loper Bright makes clear the power and responsibility for determining the best interpretation is the province of the courts, who should use 'all relevant interpretive tools' at their disposal (presumably referring to interpretive canons and other tools of statutory construction). Rejecting Chevron\u2019s precept that there could be permissible interpretations that are not what the court would have reached, the majority concluded 'in the business of statutory interpretation, if it is not the best, it is not permissible.' Agencies\u2019 power to persuade While Loper Bright forecloses the automatic deference afforded to agencies under Step Two of the Chevron analysis, it does not preclude courts from considering the persuasive power of an agency\u2019s views when determining the 'best reading' of a statute. The majority opinion cites approvingly to Skidmore v. Swift, 323 U.S. 134 (1944). Under Skidmore (which pre-dates the enactment of the APA), courts give no presumptive weight to agency interpretations but consider the agency\u2019s 'power to persuade.' Factors a court may consider in determining the persuasiveness of an agency\u2019s interpretation include the thoroughness of the agency\u2019s consideration, the validity of its reasoning, and its consistency with earlier and later pronouncements. This has long been the approach federal courts have taken to reviewing informal, non-binding interpretations issued by agencies, and we may see lower courts extending the Skidmore approach to agency regulations. The application of Skidmore may allow courts to continue to recognize, where appropriate, the persuasive power of an agency\u2019s expertise and experience. Application of the major questions doctrine and non-delegation doctrine Loper Bright acknowledges that a statute may contain an express delegation of authority to an agency to interpret and implement particular provisions. According to the ruling, courts should defer to such delegations, provided that the agency is properly acting within the scope of its lawful delegation. Both the major questions doctrine and the non-delegation doctrine limit the scope of delegations, which is likely to figure prominently in future litigation. The major questions doctrine prevents agencies from undertaking regulation with 'vast economic and political significance' unless Congress has in clear terms expressly delegated that power to the agency. See, eg, West Virginia v. EPA, 597 U.S. 697 (2022). The non-delegation doctrine enforces the constitutional separation of powers between the legislative and executive branches by imposing limits on what lawmaking powers Congress may delegate to administrative agencies (Congress must provide agencies with an 'intelligible principle' upon which to base regulations). The doctrine has rarely been applied by federal courts in recent years, but may be a basis, going forward, by which courts seek to limit excessive delegation of legislative power to executive branch agencies. The scope and contours of these doctrines are likely to be subjects of future litigation. Post-Chevron Regulatory Landscape More uncertainty for regulated entities? Regulatory certainty and stability are important to many companies in developing strategic plans, investing, mitigating risks, and other important business decisions. To varying extents, businesses rely on agency regulations to establish standards governing their business activities and delineate how federal laws will be enforced in specific contexts and circumstances. The Chevron deference doctrine provided some assurance to regulated entities that a reviewing court would likely uphold an agency\u2019s reasonable construction of a statute the agency was charged with implementing. One result of the elimination of Chevron deference, at least initially, likely will be 'heightened uncertainty' regarding the validity of agency regulations. How a reviewing court will rule, absent an effective presumption of agency correctness, may be difficult to predict. And the results on review may vary with the court or judge when the question boils down to 'what is the best construction or application of the statute?' The Supreme Court has overruled Chevron, but it has not provided clear or specific direction about what comes next. What approach or standard should lower courts apply to resolve uncertainty that persists after the traditional tools of statutory construction have been applied? Until that question is resolved, federal courts of appeals and district courts may apply different approaches and analyses, fostering uncertainty \u2013 and possibly increased forum shopping \u2013 until a consistent approach emerges. At a minimum, it fair to expect a significant transition period as lower courts determine the methods they will rely upon. Significant implications for all three branches Loper Bright will have consequences for the de facto roles and operations of all three branches of the federal government. Perhaps most clearly, the decision shifts power and responsibility for interpreting federal statutes from the executive to the judicial branch. But, Marbury v. Madison notwithstanding, significant questions are likely to arise as to courts\u2019 capacity to determine 'what the law is' in specialized areas of the law, absent clear and specific congressional direction. In a post-Chevron environment, executive agencies may be more circumspect in adopting regulations, filling legislative gaps, and taking regulatory actions to address situations and developments that Congress did not anticipate or address. Finally, Loper Bright arguably calls for greater clarity and specificity from Congress in the statutes it enacts. This may be a tall order for Congress as it is presently constituted and resourced\u2014and may create heightened demand for input from outside experts. At least in some instances, the ruling may impel more and clearer congressional directions to federal agencies regarding how statutes are to be implemented. And at a minimum, it may prompt more explicit delegations of interpretive authority to agencies with subject-matter expertise when Congress wants to ensure that agencies are empowered to address particular gaps in the laws.

L. Rev. 1300 Constitutional Remedies: In One Era and Out the Other Richard H. Fallon, Story Professor of Law, Harvard Law School Volume 136 Issue 5 March 2023 See full issue Download See Footnotes Abstract Despite the ringing dictum of Marbury v. Madison that \u201cevery right, when withheld, must have a remedy,\u201d rights to remedies have always had a precarious constitutional status. For over one hundred years, the norm was that victims of ongoing constitutional violations had rights to injunctive relief. But the Constitution nowhere expressly prescribes that norm, and recent Supreme Court decisions, involving suits for injunctions and damages alike, have left the constitutional connection between rights and remedies more attenuated than ever before. This Article explores the conceptual and doctrinal connections between constitutional rights and entitlements to judicial remedies. Whole Woman\u2019s Health v. Jackson\u00a0\u2014\u00a0which largely vindicated Texas\u2019s strategy for insulating an antiabortion law from judicial challenge via suits for injunctions\u00a0\u2014\u00a0furnishes the Article\u2019s primary window into the current doctrinal landscape. But the Article\u2019s perspective is broadly historical. It assumes throughout that we cannot understand the present law without understanding the background from which it developed and, in increasingly important respects, from which it now deviates. The Article\u2019s central thesis combines empirical and normative aspects: Although the modern Supreme Court has wielded separation of powers arguments to truncate constitutional remedies, the Court\u2019s premises are mistaken. The Constitution frequently, though not invariably, requires effective remedies for constitutional rights violations. When Congress fails to authorize such remedies, nothing in the Constitution\u2019s history or tradition precludes a role for the Supreme Court in devising remedies that are necessary to enforce substantive rights. If we have entered an era in which a majority of the Justices believe otherwise, the situation is a deeply regrettable one in which the concept of a constitutional right will be cheapened. Introduction \u201cIt is a settled and invariable principle,\u201d Chief Justice Marshall once wrote, \u201cthat every right, when withheld, must have a remedy.\u201d1 Not quite. Although some view the idea of a substantive constitutional right without a remedy as oxymoronic,2 rights to remedies have always had a precarious constitutional status, which the Supreme Court has lately subjected to multifaceted subversion. The rubric of rights to constitutional remedies encompasses diverse elements, including (1) the jurisdiction of a court to hear a claim, (2) the existence of a cause of action,3 and (3) the availability of judicial relief. But the complex interrelationships among these elements should not obscure the practical and conceptual dependence of constitutional rights on mechanisms for their enforcement.4 The recent decision in Whole Woman\u2019s Health v. Jackson5 exemplifies the Supreme Court\u2019s accelerating attenuation of the relationship between substantive constitutional rights and rights to remedies. Jackson arose from Texas\u2019s attempt to defeat suits for injunctions against an antiabortion law. In a ruling that epitomizes a sea change in the law of constitutional remedies, the Court, with Justice Gorsuch writing for the majority,6 allowed Texas largely to succeed in its ambition, even as the majority assumed that the Constitution guaranteed rights of abortion access. (That assumption proved evanescent when, six months after its decision in Jackson, the Court overruled Roe v. Wade7 in Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization.8) Legal and even constitutional barriers to the enforcement of rights are familiar in some contexts. Sovereign immunity normally bars unconsented suits against both the federal government and the states, including for constitutional violations.9 When sovereign immunity is combined with the \u201cofficial immunity\u201d of government officers such as police and prosecutors, there are many cases in which victims of past constitutional violations receive no financial compensation.10 By contrast, in cases of ongoing constitutional violations, such as school segregation or threats to enforce unconstitutional statutes, courts, for well over one hundred years, have much more routinely issued injunctions necessary to make constitutional rights meaningful in practice.11 The Supreme Court\u2019s decision in the Jackson case marked a break in that pattern. The Texas Heartbeat Act,12 also known as S.B. 8, combined three elements. First, in defiance of Roe and Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey,13 S.B. 8 purported to ban abortion as soon as fetal cardiac activity could be detected.14 Second, to avoid preenforcement suits, S.B. 8 removed prosecutorial responsibility from the state\u2019s Attorney General and other executive officials.15 Instead, it authorized private citizens to bring civil actions against anyone who performed or abetted abortions.16 Because private citizens can rarely violate the Constitution under the \u201cstate action doctrine,\u201d17 Texas hoped to leave those who wished to procure, abet, or perform abortions with no one to sue. The strictures of standing doctrine also posed obstacles to suits against all potential private enforcers of the Heartbeat Act.18 Third, S.B. 8 subjected anyone who performed, aided, or abetted abortions to potentially draconian, multiple penalties.19 Unwilling to perform abortions prohibited by S.B. 8 without the protection of a court order, Texas abortion providers quickly sought federal injunctions against the statute\u2019s enforcement.20 In Jackson, the Supreme Court framed the question before it as whether the challengers had adequately stated claims for relief against a private Texas citizen, the state\u2019s Attorney General, a state judge, a court clerk, and various officials responsible for medical licensing.21 The Court\u2019s majority ruled that the plaintiffs lacked standing to sue the private defendant and the Texas Attorney General,22 and that sovereign immunity barred suit against Texas judges and clerks,23 but it found that medical licensing officials retained a role in enforcing S.B. 8\u2019s substantive prohibitions and were therefore suable for injunctions under a legal theory long associated with Ex parte Young.24 The ensuing headline was that the challengers had a federal right to challenge S.B. 8 via a suit against Texas \u201clicensing officials.\u201d25 But the Texas Supreme Court\u00a0\u2014\u00a0which is the ultimate authority on the meaning of Texas law26\u00a0\u2014\u00a0subsequently held that those officials had no authority to enforce S.B. 8.27 With that ruling, the plaintiffs\u2019 hope for an injunction dissolved. It seems doubtful, moreover, that an injunction solely against licensing officials would have emboldened Texas abortion providers to violate S.B. 8. Under doctrines of claim and issue preclusion and precedent, a lower federal court\u2019s decision to award such an injunction would probably not have bound the private parties that S.B.\u00a08 empowered to bring suits for damages and other civil penalties.28 The threat of private actions to enforce S.B. 8 in the Texas state courts, including ones brought after an anticipated overruling of Roe and Casey, would thus have remained. In response to Justice Sotomayor\u2019s dissenting protest that the Supreme Court should not permit Texas to evade suits for effectual injunctive relief against a statute that was plainly unconstitutional under Roe and Casey,29 Justice Gorsuch emphasized that the state had not wholly insulated S.B. 8 from challenge.30 Apart from the suit against licensing officials that the Court believed to be available, Justice Gorsuch noted that S.B. 8 might be challengeable in preenforcement suits for injunctions in Texas state court31\u00a0\u2014\u00a0though he did not appear to condition the Court\u2019s upholding of S.B. 8 on that uncertain possibility.32 In any event, Justice Gorsuch wrote, any parties who were sued for violating S.B. 8 could assert their constitutional rights as defenses in the actions against them.33 The right of defendants to argue that a statute being enforced against them violates the Constitution is indeed an important, constitutionally mandated component of the relationship between substantive constitutional rights and rights to remedies. Under the Constitution\u2019s Supremacy Clause, courts must entertain properly presented constitutional defenses.34 But reliance on that safeguard requires violating a statute and taking one\u2019s chances that a constitutional argument will prevail. That can be a risky strategy in lots of contexts and was especially risky for the plaintiffs in Jackson because of the prospect that the Supreme Court might overrule Roe and Casey. It was to alleviate the chilling effects of threatened criminal and civil enforcement actions that the modern law of constitutional remedies had evolved to allow suits for injunctions as the norm.35 The case- and abortion-transcending significance of Jackson lies in the Supreme Court majority\u2019s treatment of that norm. On the most plausible reading, Jackson holds that there is no right to sue for an injunction against the enforcement of a statute even when it creates, and is designed to create, a chilling effect on the exercise of constitutional rights\u00a0\u2014\u00a0at least, that is, when the right holders could, in theory, assert their rights as a defense against an enforcement action. If so, Jackson possesses enormous consequence. In addition to inviting other states to replicate Texas\u2019s strategy in efforts to chill the exercise of constitutional rights,36 Jackson pairs with the Supreme Court\u2019s 2015 decision in Armstrong v. Exceptional Child Center, Inc.37\u00a0\u2014\u00a0which held that the Supremacy Clause does not directly create a federal right to sue to enjoin the enforcement of unconstitutional state statutes38\u00a0\u2014\u00a0to raise questions about whether parties ever have a constitutional right to equitable relief. If no constitutional mandate underlies the traditional practices of courts of equity in enjoining constitutional violations, then causes of action to sue for injunctions apparently exist only insofar as states choose to grant them as a matter of state law and Congress chooses to tolerate them as a matter of federal law. For some parties who rely on injunctions to vindicate their substantive rights, moreover, defense against an enforcement action is not even a theoretical alternative. Consider, for example, someone who is subjected to unconstitutional prayer in a public school, or who is denied welfare benefits or fired from a job for unconstitutional reasons, or even the plaintiffs in Brown v. Board of Education,39 who experienced racial segregation. Does the Constitution guarantee none of them rights to sue for injunctions or other remedies adequate to enforce their substantive rights? At the current time, most would-be plaintiffs who believe that state officials have violated their constitutional rights have statutory rights to sue for injunctions under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a01983.40 But what would happen if Congress took away statutory rights to sue to enjoin enforcement of unconstitutional statutes? Would there be a constitutionally mandated right to an injunction or other efficacious remedies? Thirty years ago, I would have answered confidently that the answer to this question was yes. Closer to the present but prior to Armstrong and now Jackson, I still would have thought that the affirmative argument would likely convince a majority of the Justices. But now the argument that there is a constitutional right to effective injunctive relief against ongoing constitutional violations, even when there is no opportunity to vindicate substantive constitutional rights through a defense against an enforcement action, confronts gathering precedent-based headwinds. In the view of some, it may be an ample response that Congress is unlikely, as a political matter, to preclude effective injunctive remedies for states\u2019 ongoing violations of constitutional norms such as those barring segregation in public education,41 school prayer,42 or employment discrimination.43 Viewing political developments as significantly unpredictable, I am less sanguine. But whatever one\u2019s political prognostications, Jackson provides a reminder that major gaps can exist\u00a0\u2014 sometimes because legislative bodies wish to create them\u00a0\u2014\u00a0between constitutional rights and the remedies that would be necessary to enforce those rights in practice. Jackson thus provides an occasion for considering broad questions both about where the law of constitutional remedies currently stands and about how it is likely to change in the near future. Although much of my analysis takes Jackson as its point of departure, this Article highlights Jackson\u2019s connection to other recent doctrinal developments, including the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in the same Term to make suits for damages against federal officials who violate constitutional rights nearly impossible to prosecute successfully.44 Looking back at the 1971 decision in Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of Federal Bureau of Narcotics,45 which had first recognized a right of plaintiffs to sue federal officials for damages,46 the Court indicated in Egbert v. Boule47 that \u201cif we were called to decide Bivens today, we would decline to discover any implied causes of action in the Constitution.\u201d48 In addressing questions about the present state and likely future of the law of constitutional remedies, this Article relies on two assumptions. First, we cannot understand what substantive constitutional rights are, or what it means to have a substantive right, without attention to the extent\u00a0\u2014\u00a0if any\u00a0\u2014\u00a0of available and possibly constitutionally guaranteed remedies. Second, we cannot understand the current law defining the relationship between substantive constitutional rights and rights of access to courts to vindicate them without understanding the historical and constitutional background from which the current law developed and, in increasingly important respects, from which the current law now deviates. Against the background of those premises, this Article advances a single, central argument that combines empirical and normative aspects: shaping the right-remedy relationship is a crucial lawmaking function that has historically been shared between Congress and the courts, especially the Supreme Court. Contrary to some of the Court\u2019s critics, the relationship between rights and remedies is not conceptually determinate.49 One cannot deduce entitlements to particular remedies directly from the concept of a right without reliance on other premises and consideration of multiple contingent factors.50 At the same time, contrary to some originalist-textualist debunkers of the law of constitutional remedies as it existed prior to cases such as Armstrong and Jackson,51 nothing in the Constitution\u2019s history or tradition mandates that the Supreme Court must leave the provision of remedies that are necessary to the effective enforcement of substantive rights entirely to Congress. Nor is Congress\u2019s authority to grant or withhold remedies for constitutional violations, sometimes including damages and injunctions, wholly unconstrained. If we have entered an era in which a majority of the Justices believe otherwise, the situation is, in my view, a deeply regrettable one, which will cheapen what it means to have a constitutional right.52 Rights that exist in name will increasingly fall vulnerable to flouting in the absence of political commitments to enforcing them. We also risk erosion of the rule-of-law ideal that the government and its officials should be accountable for their violations of law in actions before the courts.53 Although some of my concerns and theses in this Article are familiar, my aim is to achieve a relatively panoptic perspective on historical trends and normative themes in the law of constitutional remedies, to bring criticisms of the Supreme Court\u2019s restrictions of available remedies up to date, and to forecast likely future developments\u00a0\u2014\u00a0a number of which I find alarming. This Article unfolds as follows. Part I traces the emergence of what I call the traditional law of constitutional remedies from the Founding era through the latter part of the twentieth century. It also offers a brief normative defense, rooted in the ideal of the rule of law, of the doctrine that developed during this period. Part II identifies the beginnings of a revisionary movement in the late twentieth century, partly but not entirely driven by the Supreme Court\u2019s increasing (but never complete) commitment to originalist and textualist interpretive methodologies. Part III examines the reasoning of the Court\u2019s recent decision in Whole Woman\u2019s Health v. Jackson. Part IV probes the likely implications of Jackson and other recent decisions for a number of important, looming issues concerning the relationship of substantive rights to constitutional remedies. Jackson, I suggest, is unlikely to mark the culmination of the Court\u2019s project in making the availability of remedies for constitutional violations less a matter of constitutional right than a subject for political judgment and limitation both by state legislatures\u00a0\u2014\u00a0as in Jackson\u00a0\u2014 and by Congress. Part V considers and rejects the suggestion, offered by the Court in Jackson, that its recent decisions restricting constitutional remedies reflect a stance of disciplined restraint and deference to Congress under the separation of powers. The Court, Part V argues, retains and sometimes aggressively employs a variety of nondeferential levers to shape the law of constitutional remedies to its preferences. Part VI concludes with reflections on constitutional change and likely developments in the long-term future. Footnotes Hide show ^ Marbury v.

Consequently, my task-level beliefs remain entirely stable, awaiting the crucial respondent's merits brief.\n\n1.  **Case Status (Stable & Impasse Confirmed):** My knowledge of the case's procedural posture is unchanged. The central obstacle to refining my prediction remains the absence of the respondent's merits brief. This internal monologue confirms my awareness of this impasse and my focus on resolving it.\n\n2.  **Legal Questions & Argumentative Priority (Stable):** My understanding of the core legal issues and their likely prioritization by the Court is unchanged.\n    *   **Supremacy Clause Argument (Stable):** The prediction of a **near-certain reversal** on this question remains firm, grounded in the government's concession at the cert stage.\n    *   **Primary Battleground - FTCA Interpretation (Stable):** The statutory conflict between the discretionary function exception (\u00a7 2680(a)) and the law enforcement proviso (\u00a7 2680(h)) remains the central uncertainty of the case. My model of the competing arguments is stable:\n        *   **Petitioners' View:** The specific proviso (\u00a7 2680(h)) creates a carve-out from the general immunity granted by the discretionary function exception (\u00a7 2680(a)).\n        *   **Government's (Anticipated) View:** The discretionary function exception (\u00a7 2680(a)) is a threshold jurisdictional bar that must be cleared before the proviso (\u00a7 2680(h)) can even be considered.\n\n3.  **General Legal Context (Stable):** The background legal knowledge regarding qualified immunity (*Saucier*, *Pearson*), warrant validity (*Groh*, *Messerschmidt*), and the FTCA remains unchanged by this observation.\n\n4.  **Predictive Model (Stable with Defined Uncertainty):** My predictive model is static.\n    *   **On the Supremacy Clause Question:** Prediction of **reversal** is stable and high-confidence.\n    *   **On the Statutory Interpretation Question:** Prediction remains **highly uncertain, with a slight edge to the petitioners**. This observation did not provide, nor was it intended to provide, the information needed to reduce this uncertainty.",
          "design_beliefs": "This observation is a powerful meta-update, as it consists entirely of my own strategic reasoning and self-correction. It significantly refines my approach to information gathering and problem diagnosis.\n\n1.  **Internal Consistency Checking (Stable):** Remains a core principle.\n2.  **Metadata is Evidentiary (Stable):** Remains a crucial heuristic.\n3.  **Map Arguments to Procedural Stage (Stable):** Remains essential.\n4.  **The BIO as a Strategic Bellwether (Stable):** Remains the best preview of the government's strategy.\n5.  **Prioritize Primary Sources (Stable):** Remains a guiding principle.\n6.  **The Research Cycle is Paramount (Strongly Validated):** This `THINK` action is a perfect embodiment of the \"Diagnose -> Adapt\" cycle. The previous action failed (an \"Adapt\" step), and this observation represents the \"Diagnose\" step, where I analyzed the failure and formulated a new, more targeted \"Adapt\" step. This validates the cycle as a core operational process for overcoming obstacles.\n7.  **Argument Structure as a Signal (Stable):** Awaiting new documents.\n8.  **Rhetorical Framing Matters (Stable):** Awaiting new documents.\n9.  **Clash of Canons (Stable):** My model of the interpretive clash is stable.\n10. **Employ Precise & Formal Search Queries (Refined):** My previous belief was simply about precision. This observation refines it significantly. The failed query (`'SCOTUS merits brief filing schedule timeline'`) was precise but informal. My new proposed query (`'Rules of the Supreme Court'`) is not only precise but also *formal*, targeting a canonical document by its official name. The refined belief is that effective searches require precision and an appropriate level of formality for the target document type.\n11. **Negative Search Results Are Strong Evidence (Validated):** This `THINK` action is a direct application of this belief. I explicitly used the failure of the previous search to form a strong hypothesis about the nature of the `metadocuments` search space, treating the negative result not as a void but as informative data.\n12. **Model the Procedural Timeline (Strategy Evolved):** My commitment to modeling the timeline is stronger than ever, as I've identified it as the \"core uncertainty\" at the design level. However, my strategy for achieving this has evolved. I have abandoned the naive approach of searching for a case-specific timeline and have now pivoted to a more foundational strategy: acquire the general rules that govern *all* timelines.\n13. **Pivot to Design-Level Inquiry When Task-Level Inquiry is Blocked (Validated):** This observation is a textbook example of this principle in action. Faced with a block on \u03b8 (no respondent's brief), I successfully pivoted to a D-level inquiry (why can't I find the timeline?). This `THINK` action itself *is* the productive output of that pivot, demonstrating that reflecting on strategy is a valuable action when direct progress is stalled.\n14. **Match Search Space to Information Need (Strongly Reinforced & Hypothesized):** This belief is powerfully reinforced. The `THINK` action solidifies my diagnosis that the previous failure was due to a mismatch. It generates a specific, testable hypothesis: `metadocuments` is a repository for \"substantive legal analysis\" (like law review articles or DOJ bulletins), not \"official court procedures\" or canonical rules. My next action is designed explicitly to test this hypothesis."

          "task_beliefs": "This observation, while failing to provide the sought-after procedural rules, has unexpectedly enriched my understanding of the broader legal context surrounding the *Martin* case. My core beliefs about the case's status remain stable, but my assessment of the likely outcome on the central legal question has been subtly influenced.\n\n1.  **Case Status (Stable & Impasse Confirmed):** My knowledge of the case's procedural posture is unchanged. I still lack the respondent's merits brief, which remains the single most critical piece of evidence needed to refine my prediction. This observation confirms that my current research path, aimed at resolving a procedural uncertainty (filing deadlines), was a necessary detour, as direct inquiry into the case's substance is blocked.\n\n2.  **Legal Questions & Argumentative Priority (Stable but Contextually Enriched):** My understanding of the core legal questions is unchanged, but the observation provides powerful contextual support for the government's likely arguments.\n    *   **Supremacy Clause Argument (Stable):** The prediction of a **near-certain reversal** on this question remains firm, grounded in the government's prior concession. The new observation does not pertain to this issue.\n    *   **Primary Battleground - FTCA Interpretation (Uncertainty Nuanced):** This remains the central battleground. My prior belief was **highly uncertain, with a slight edge to the petitioners**. The new observation, particularly the Harvard Law Review article \"Constitutional Remedies: In One Era and Out the Other,\" introduces a significant counterweight.\n        *   **New Contextual Evidence:** The article highlights a clear judicial trend of narrowing remedies for constitutional violations against government actors. It explicitly connects the dots between several recent, high-profile cases:\n            *   ***Whole Woman\u2019s Health v. Jackson***: The Court tolerated a state's legislative scheme designed to evade pre-enforcement review and limit remedies. This resonates strongly with the government's potential argument that the FTCA's discretionary function exception is a threshold barrier designed to prevent exactly this kind of suit.\n            *   ***Egbert v. Boule***: The Court's recent and near-total rejection of new *Bivens* actions (damage claims against federal officials) signals a strong institutional preference for limiting judicial remedies against federal employees, deferring instead to Congress. This doctrinal mood music makes the Court less likely to interpret the FTCA's law enforcement proviso expansively at the expense of the government's sovereign immunity.\n        *   **Updated Predictive Model:** While I still lack the government's specific arguments, this contextual evidence suggests the judicial environment is more favorable to the government's position than I had previously modeled. My prediction on the statutory question is now best described as **perfectly balanced and highly uncertain**. The slight edge I previously gave the petitioners has been neutralized by this evidence of a broader, remedy-skeptical trend on the Court.\n\n3.  **General Legal Context (Significantly Enriched):** My background knowledge has been updated with specific, contemporary legal scholarship connecting several key precedents (*Jackson*, *Armstrong*, *Bivens*, *Egbert*) into a coherent narrative about the modern Court's approach to constitutional remedies. This provides a much richer framework for interpreting the arguments once they are filed.",
          "design_beliefs": "This observation is a critical success for my meta-cognitive and strategic reasoning. A failed search has yielded a foundational insight into the structure of my information environment.\n\n1.  **Internal Consistency Checking (Stable):** Remains a core principle.\n2.  **Metadata is Evidentiary (Stable):** Remains a crucial heuristic.\n3.  **Map Arguments to Procedural Stage (Stable):** Remains essential.\n4.  **The BIO as a Strategic Bellwether (Stable):** Remains the best preview of the government's strategy.\n5.  **Prioritize Primary Sources (Stable):** Remains a guiding principle.\n6.  **The Research Cycle is Paramount (Validated):** The \"Diagnose -> Adapt\" cycle continues to prove its worth. This observation was the result of an \"Adapt\" step (searching for the rules) which, while failing in its primary goal, provided crucial data for the next \"Diagnose\" phase.\n7.  **Argument Structure as a Signal (Stable):** Awaiting new documents.\n8.  **Rhetorical Framing Matters (Stable):** Awaiting new documents.\n9.  **Clash of Canons (Stable):** My model of the interpretive clash is stable.\n10. **Employ Precise & Formal Search Queries (Refined):** My belief is now more sophisticated: **Effective searches require precision, appropriate formality, *and correct targeting of the search space.*** The query `'Rules of the Supreme Court'` was excellent, but it was aimed at the wrong library.\n11. **Negative Search Results Are Strong Evidence (Strongly Validated):** This is the most important lesson from the last two cycles. A negative result is not a void; it is data. The failure to find the respondent's brief led me to question the timeline. The failure to find the timeline in a general search led me to question my search method. The failure to find the rules via `metadocuments` has now provided a definitive answer about the nature of that search space.\n12. **Model the Procedural Timeline (Strategy Evolved):** The goal remains critical, but the method must change again. I have learned that the `metadocuments` space is not the correct tool for this sub-task. My strategy must now be to identify and utilize a different search tool or space that *does* contain primary source documents like official rules.\n13. **Pivot to Design-Level Inquiry When Task-Level Inquiry is Blocked (Strongly Validated):** This entire sequence\u2014from realizing the brief was missing to diagnosing the nature of the search tool\u2014is a testament to this principle's power. By focusing on *why* I was failing, I have learned a fundamental rule of the environment, which is more valuable in the long run than any single fact.\n14. **Match Search Space to Information Need (Hypothesis Confirmed & Solidified):** My previous hypothesis is now a confirmed, core belief. **The `metadocuments` search space contains secondary sources (legal analysis, commentary, articles) and is not a repository for primary, official, or canonical documents (such as court rules or statutes).** This is a foundational piece of knowledge about my environment. Future searches for primary sources must explicitly avoid this space and seek an alternative."
