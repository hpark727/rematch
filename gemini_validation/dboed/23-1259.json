    "facts_of_the_case": "This case involves victims and family members of HAMAS terrorist attacks who sued BLOM Bank SAL for allegedly aiding HAMAS by providing financial services to customers affiliated with the terrorist organization. The plaintiffs brought their case under the Anti-Terrorism Act, as amended by the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act (JASTA), claiming BLOM Bank was liable for aiding and abetting terrorism through these financial services.\n\nThe plaintiffs filed their initial complaint in January 2019, which the district court dismissed for failure to state a claim. On appeal, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed the dismissal but clarified that the district court had applied the wrong legal standard for aiding-and-abetting liability under JASTA. The plaintiffs then returned to the district court and moved to vacate the dismissal and amend their complaint. The district court denied their motion, and the Second Circuit concluded that the district court had erred by not properly balancing the competing principles of judgment finality (Rule 60(b)) and liberal pleading standards (Rule 15(a)).",

The cert petition will provide the petitioner's precise framing of the 'Question Presented,' their core legal arguments grounded in text and precedent, and a detailed map of the circuit split on this issue. This moves my understanding from 'what is the conflict?' to 'what are the specific arguments for one side?', which is a critical and foundational step for predicting the outcome. It is the single most important document for understanding the petitioner's case.\nDesign EIG (0.8): This action directly tests and validates the design heuristic I just formulated: 'identify the legal conflict, then analyze the petitioner's cert petition.' Successfully retrieving and analyzing this document will provide strong evidence that this is a highly effective and efficient information-gathering strategy. It solidifies a key step in a generalizable workflow for all SCOTUS cases, moving the heuristic from a hypothesis to a validated best practice.\nJoint EIG (1.7): The action provides immense value on both fronts.

Crosby, 545 U.S. 524, \n535 (2005) (quoting Ackermann v. United States, 340 \nU.S. 193, 199 (1950)).  This Court has also stressed \nthat a movant must be \u201cfaultless\u201d to obtain relief.  \nPioneer Inv. Servs. v. Brunswick Assocs. Ltd. P\u2019ship, \n507 U.S. 380, 393 (1993).  \u201cThis very strict \ninterpretation of Rule 60(b) is essential if the finality \nof judgments is to be preserved.\u201d  Gonzalez, 545 U.S. \nat 535 (cleaned up).  In this case, Respondents \ndeclined multiple invitations and opportunities to \namend their complaint.  The District Court then \ndismissed their complaint with prejudice, and the \nSecond Circuit affirmed.  Only then did Respondents \nmove to vacate the judgment so they could file an \namended complaint.  The District Court denied the \nmotion under Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s well-settled standard.  \nBut the Second Circuit reversed, based on an \nunprecedented \u201cbalanc[ing]\u201d test that requires district \ncourts to consider Rule 15(a)\u2019s \u201cliberal pleading \nprinciples\u201d when addressing a Rule 60(b)(6) motion to \nreopen a judgment for the purpose of filing an \namended complaint. \nThe question presented is: \nWhether Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s stringent standard applies \nto a post-judgment request to vacate for the purpose of \nfiling an amended complaint. \n \n\nii \n \nPARTIES TO THE PROCEEDING \nPetitioner BLOM Bank SAL was defendant in the \nUnited States District Court for the Eastern District \nof New York and appellee in the United States Court \nof Appeals for the Second Circuit.  \nRespondents Michal Honickman, Individually and \nfor the Estate of Howard Goldstein, Eugene \nGoldstein, Lorraine Goldstein, Richard Goldstein, \nBarbara Goldstein Ingardia, Michael Goldstein, \nChana Freedman, David Goldstein, Moses Strauss, \nPhilip Strauss, Bluma Strauss, Ahron Strauss, Roisie \nEngelman, Joseph Strauss, Tzvi Weiss, Leib Weiss, \nIndividually and for the Estate of Malka Weiss, \nYitzchak Weiss, Yeruchaim Weiss, Esther Deutsch, \nMatanya Nathansen, Individually and for the Estate \nof Tehilla Nathansen, Chana Nathansen, Individually \nand for the Estate of Tehilla Nathansen, Yehudit \nNathansen, S.N., a minor, Hezekial Toporowitch, \nPearl B.

Civ.  \n\u00a7 2857 (3d ed.) ........................................................ 21 \n\n1 \n \n \nPETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI \nThe \ndecision \nbelow \nentrenches \na \nhighly \nconsequential circuit split and flatly contradicts this \nCourt\u2019s precedents.  As those precedents make clear, \nobtaining relief from a final judgment under Rule \n60(b)(6) \u201crequires a showing of \u2018extraordinary \ncircumstances.\u2019\u201d  Gonzalez v. Crosby, 545 U.S. 524, 536 \n(2005).  And those circumstances must demonstrate \n\u201cthat the [moving] party is faultless.\u201d  Pioneer Inv. \nServs. v. Brunswick Assocs. Ltd. P\u2019ship, 507 U.S. 380, \n393 (1993).  After all, \u201c[t]here must be an end to \nlitigation someday, and free, calculated, deliberate \nchoices are not to be relieved from.\u201d  Ackermann v. \nUnited States, 340 U.S. 193, 198 (1950).   \nFor decades, lower courts have faithfully applied \nthese finality principles.  And they have uniformly \nrejected attempts by plaintiffs to avoid Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s \nstringent requirements by appealing to Rule 15(a)\u2019s \nliberal amendment policy.  The two inquiries are \nentirely separate.  Accordingly, \u201cif a plaintiff seeks to \nreopen a case under Rule 60(b) in order to file an \namended complaint, she must satisfy one of the Rule \n60(b) grounds before a court may consider her motion \nto amend.\u201d  Daulatzai v. Maryland, 97 F.4th 166, 178 \n(4th Cir. 2024).  As the Fourth Circuit aptly put it, \nadopting a contrary rule would have placed it \u201calone \nin the Nation in collapsing the Rule 60(b) standard \nwith the standard for Rule 15(a).\u201d  Id. at 177. \nBut the Second Circuit has done just that\u2014in a \ncase where Respondents repeatedly declined to amend \ntheir complaint in the normal course.  By rejecting the \nDistrict Court\u2019s multiple invitations to amend their \ncomplaint, Respondents deliberately chose to proceed \n\n2 \n \non the complaint as pled and take their chances on a \nmotion to dismiss and appeal.  The District Court \ndismissed that complaint with prejudice.  The Second \nCircuit affirmed after full merits briefing, oral \nargument, and supplemental briefing.  And at no time \nduring those appellate proceedings did Respondents \nseek leave to amend.   \nThen, 18 months after the dismissal with \nprejudice\u2014and after that dismissal was affirmed on \nappeal\u2014Respondents filed a Rule 60(b)(6) motion to \nvacate the judgment so they could try again with an \namended complaint.  The District Court properly \napplied Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d \nstandard to deny Respondents\u2019 motion.  Yet, the \nSecond Circuit reversed.  Based on a newly crafted test \nadopted by a split panel in Mandala v. NTT Data, 88 \nF.4th 353 (2d Cir. 2023), reh\u2019g en banc denied (2d Cir. \nFeb. 13, 2024), the Second Circuit held that the \nDistrict Court abused its discretion in failing to \u201cgive \n\u2018due regard\u2019 to \u2018both the philosophy favoring finality of \njudgments . . . and the liberal amendment policy of \nRule 15(a).\u2019\u201d  Pet.App.7 (quoting Mandala, 88 F.4th at \n361).  In the Second Circuit\u2019s view, district courts are \n\u201crequired to consider Rule 60(b) finality and Rule 15(a) \nliberality in tandem\u201d when plaintiffs seek to reopen a \njudgment in order to file an amended complaint.  Id.   \nThat reasoning is untenable.  The Second Circuit\u2019s \nbalancing test effectively rewrites the Federal Rules of \nCivil Procedure, eviscerates the finality principles \nembodied in Rule 60(b), and contravenes this Court\u2019s \nprecedents several times over.  It also squarely \nconflicts with every one of the eleven other Circuits \nthat have addressed this issue.  Those courts have \n\n3 \n \nunanimously held that Rule 15\u2019s general policy has no \nplace in the Rule 60(b)(6) analysis.  Indeed, over 40 \nyears ago, then-Judge Breyer explained that, absent \nextraordinary circumstances, the Federal Rules of \nCivil Procedure do not \u201callow plaintiffs to pursue a \ncase to judgment and then, if they lose, to reopen the \ncase by amending their complaint to take account of \nthe court\u2019s decision.\u201d  James v. Watt, 716 F.2d 71, 78 \n(1st Cir. 1983) (Breyer, J.). \nNot only is the Second Circuit\u2019s outlier test wrong, \nbut its decision threatens to unleash far-reaching \nconsequences in cases filed within that court\u2019s bounds.  \nAs Judge Sullivan noted in his Mandala dissent, the \nSecond Circuit\u2019s novel balancing test \u201cwill erode the \nfinality of judgments throughout th[e] Circuit, \nsignificantly undermine the important purposes \nserved by Rule 60(b), and increase the workload of \nbusy district court judges who carry the heaviest \nburden in our system of civil justice.\u201d  Pet.App.192 \n(Sullivan, J., dissenting).  Worse still, the test will \nencourage litigants to wait to amend their complaint \nuntil after final judgment and appeals have run their \ncourse, as Respondents did here.  That wasteful course \nis at odds with the finality and efficiency principles \nthat animate the Federal Rules, which this Court\u2019s \nprecedents have long enforced. \nThe Court should thus grant certiorari to restore \nuniformity in the law, to reverse the Second Circuit\u2019s \nerror on this issue of exceptional importance, and to \npreserve the finality of judgments protected by Rule \n60(b)(6). \n\n4 \n \nOPINIONS BELOW \nThe District Court\u2019s opinion dismissing the case is \nreported at 432 F. Supp. 3d 253 and is reproduced at \nPet.App.54-87.  The Second Circuit\u2019s opinion affirming \nthe district court\u2019s dismissal is reported at 6 F.4th 487 \nand is reproduced at Pet.App.20-53.

This Court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1254(1). \nSTATUTORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b)(6) provides \nthat \u201cthe court may relieve a party or its legal \nrepresentative from a final judgment, order, or \nproceeding for . . . any other reason that justifies \nrelief.\u201d \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(a)(2) provides \nthat \u201ca party may amend its pleading . . . with the \nopposing party\u2019s written consent or the court\u2019s leave. \nThe court should freely give leave when justice so \nrequires.\u201d \n \n\n5 \n \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nA.

This Court has also stressed \nthat a movant must be \u201cfaultless\u201d to obtain relief.  \nPioneer Inv. Servs. v. Brunswick Assocs. Ltd. P\u2019ship, \n507 U.S. 380, 393 (1993).  \u201cThis very strict \ninterpretation of Rule 60(b) is essential if the finality \nof judgments is to be preserved.\u201d  Gonzalez, 545 U.S. \nat 535 (cleaned up).  In this case, Respondents \ndeclined multiple invitations and opportunities to \namend their complaint.  The District Court then \ndismissed their complaint with prejudice, and the \nSecond Circuit affirmed.  Only then did Respondents \nmove to vacate the judgment so they could file an \namended complaint.  The District Court denied the \nmotion under Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s well-settled standard.  \nBut the Second Circuit reversed, based on an \nunprecedented \u201cbalanc[ing]\u201d test that requires district \ncourts to consider Rule 15(a)\u2019s \u201cliberal pleading \nprinciples\u201d when addressing a Rule 60(b)(6) motion to \nreopen a judgment for the purpose of filing an \namended complaint. \nThe question presented is: \nWhether Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s stringent standard applies \nto a post-judgment request to vacate for the purpose of \nfiling an amended complaint. \n \n\nii \n \nPARTIES TO THE PROCEEDING \nPetitioner BLOM Bank SAL was defendant in the \nUnited States District Court for the Eastern District \nof New York and appellee in the United States Court \nof Appeals for the Second Circuit.  \nRespondents Michal Honickman, Individually and \nfor the Estate of Howard Goldstein, Eugene \nGoldstein, Lorraine Goldstein, Richard Goldstein, \nBarbara Goldstein Ingardia, Michael Goldstein, \nChana Freedman, David Goldstein, Moses Strauss, \nPhilip Strauss, Bluma Strauss, Ahron Strauss, Roisie \nEngelman, Joseph Strauss, Tzvi Weiss, Leib Weiss, \nIndividually and for the Estate of Malka Weiss, \nYitzchak Weiss, Yeruchaim Weiss, Esther Deutsch, \nMatanya Nathansen, Individually and for the Estate \nof Tehilla Nathansen, Chana Nathansen, Individually \nand for the Estate of Tehilla Nathansen, Yehudit \nNathansen, S.N., a minor, Hezekial Toporowitch, \nPearl B.

As those precedents make clear, \nobtaining relief from a final judgment under Rule \n60(b)(6) \u201crequires a showing of \u2018extraordinary \ncircumstances.\u2019\u201d  Gonzalez v. Crosby, 545 U.S. 524, 536 \n(2005).  And those circumstances must demonstrate \n\u201cthat the [moving] party is faultless.\u201d  Pioneer Inv. \nServs. v. Brunswick Assocs. Ltd. P\u2019ship, 507 U.S. 380, \n393 (1993).  After all, \u201c[t]here must be an end to \nlitigation someday, and free, calculated, deliberate \nchoices are not to be relieved from.\u201d  Ackermann v. \nUnited States, 340 U.S. 193, 198 (1950).   \nFor decades, lower courts have faithfully applied \nthese finality principles.  And they have uniformly \nrejected attempts by plaintiffs to avoid Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s \nstringent requirements by appealing to Rule 15(a)\u2019s \nliberal amendment policy.  The two inquiries are \nentirely separate.  Accordingly, \u201cif a plaintiff seeks to \nreopen a case under Rule 60(b) in order to file an \namended complaint, she must satisfy one of the Rule \n60(b) grounds before a court may consider her motion \nto amend.\u201d  Daulatzai v. Maryland, 97 F.4th 166, 178 \n(4th Cir. 2024).  As the Fourth Circuit aptly put it, \nadopting a contrary rule would have placed it \u201calone \nin the Nation in collapsing the Rule 60(b) standard \nwith the standard for Rule 15(a).\u201d  Id. at 177. \nBut the Second Circuit has done just that\u2014in a \ncase where Respondents repeatedly declined to amend \ntheir complaint in the normal course.  By rejecting the \nDistrict Court\u2019s multiple invitations to amend their \ncomplaint, Respondents deliberately chose to proceed \n\n2 \n \non the complaint as pled and take their chances on a \nmotion to dismiss and appeal.  The District Court \ndismissed that complaint with prejudice.  The Second \nCircuit affirmed after full merits briefing, oral \nargument, and supplemental briefing.  And at no time \nduring those appellate proceedings did Respondents \nseek leave to amend.   \nThen, 18 months after the dismissal with \nprejudice\u2014and after that dismissal was affirmed on \nappeal\u2014Respondents filed a Rule 60(b)(6) motion to \nvacate the judgment so they could try again with an \namended complaint.  The District Court properly \napplied Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d \nstandard to deny Respondents\u2019 motion.  Yet, the \nSecond Circuit reversed.  Based on a newly crafted test \nadopted by a split panel in Mandala v. NTT Data, 88 \nF.4th 353 (2d Cir. 2023), reh\u2019g en banc denied (2d Cir. \nFeb. 13, 2024), the Second Circuit held that the \nDistrict Court abused its discretion in failing to \u201cgive \n\u2018due regard\u2019 to \u2018both the philosophy favoring finality of \njudgments . . . and the liberal amendment policy of \nRule 15(a).\u2019\u201d  Pet.App.7 (quoting Mandala, 88 F.4th at \n361).  In the Second Circuit\u2019s view, district courts are \n\u201crequired to consider Rule 60(b) finality and Rule 15(a) \nliberality in tandem\u201d when plaintiffs seek to reopen a \njudgment in order to file an amended complaint.  Id.   \nThat reasoning is untenable.  The Second Circuit\u2019s \nbalancing test effectively rewrites the Federal Rules of \nCivil Procedure, eviscerates the finality principles \nembodied in Rule 60(b), and contravenes this Court\u2019s \nprecedents several times over.  It also squarely \nconflicts with every one of the eleven other Circuits \nthat have addressed this issue.  Those courts have \n\n3 \n \nunanimously held that Rule 15\u2019s general policy has no \nplace in the Rule 60(b)(6) analysis.  Indeed, over 40 \nyears ago, then-Judge Breyer explained that, absent \nextraordinary circumstances, the Federal Rules of \nCivil Procedure do not \u201callow plaintiffs to pursue a \ncase to judgment and then, if they lose, to reopen the \ncase by amending their complaint to take account of \nthe court\u2019s decision.\u201d  James v. Watt, 716 F.2d 71, 78 \n(1st Cir. 1983) (Breyer, J.). \nNot only is the Second Circuit\u2019s outlier test wrong, \nbut its decision threatens to unleash far-reaching \nconsequences in cases filed within that court\u2019s bounds.  \nAs Judge Sullivan noted in his Mandala dissent, the \nSecond Circuit\u2019s novel balancing test \u201cwill erode the \nfinality of judgments throughout th[e] Circuit, \nsignificantly undermine the important purposes \nserved by Rule 60(b), and increase the workload of \nbusy district court judges who carry the heaviest \nburden in our system of civil justice.\u201d  Pet.App.192 \n(Sullivan, J., dissenting).  Worse still, the test will \nencourage litigants to wait to amend their complaint \nuntil after final judgment and appeals have run their \ncourse, as Respondents did here.  That wasteful course \nis at odds with the finality and efficiency principles \nthat animate the Federal Rules, which this Court\u2019s \nprecedents have long enforced. \nThe Court should thus grant certiorari to restore \nuniformity in the law, to reverse the Second Circuit\u2019s \nerror on this issue of exceptional importance, and to \npreserve the finality of judgments protected by Rule \n60(b)(6). \n\n4 \n \nOPINIONS BELOW \nThe District Court\u2019s opinion dismissing the case is \nreported at 432 F. Supp. 3d 253 and is reproduced at \nPet.App.54-87.  The Second Circuit\u2019s opinion affirming \nthe district court\u2019s dismissal is reported at 6 F.4th 487 \nand is reproduced at Pet.App.20-53.

This Court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1254(1). \nSTATUTORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b)(6) provides \nthat \u201cthe court may relieve a party or its legal \nrepresentative from a final judgment, order, or \nproceeding for . . . any other reason that justifies \nrelief.\u201d \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(a)(2) provides \nthat \u201ca party may amend its pleading . . . with the \nopposing party\u2019s written consent or the court\u2019s leave. \nThe court should freely give leave when justice so \nrequires.\u201d \n \n\n5 \n \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nA. The Initial District Court Proceedings \nRespondents filed this lawsuit on January 1, 2019, \na day before the statute of limitations expired.  They \nare victims and the families of victims of a series of \nterrorist attacks carried out by Hamas between \nDecember 1, 2001, and August 19, 2003.  Complaint, \nHonickman, et al. v. BLOM Bank SAL, No. 1:19-cv-\n00008-KAM-SMG (E.D.N.Y. Jan 1, 2019), ECF No. 1.  \nThe complaint accuses Petitioner of aiding and \nabetting those attacks by providing routine financial \nservices to three customers (Sanabil, Subul al-Khair, \nand Union of Good; together, the \u201cThree Customers\u201d), \nwho Respondents allege are associated with Hamas.  \nAs Petitioner explained in the proceedings below, it \ncategorically abhors terrorism, has no connection to \nHamas, and is not legally or factually responsible for \nRespondents\u2019 injuries. \nRespondents pled their claim under the Anti-\nTerrorism Act (\u201cATA\u201d), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2333, as amended \nby the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act \n(\u201cJASTA\u201d), id. \u00a7 2333(d)(2).  Under JASTA, a United \nStates national \u201cinjured in his or her person, property, \nor business by reason of an act of international \nterrorism, or his or her estate, survivors, or heirs, may \nsue therefore in any appropriate district court of the \nUnited States.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 2333(a).  JASTA provides for \nsecondary liability against \u201cany person who aids and \nabets, by knowingly providing substantial assistance, \nor who conspires with the person who committed such \nan act of international terrorism.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 2333(d)(2).   \n \n\n6 \n \nJASTA secondary liability requires \u201cthat the \ndefendant consciously and culpably \u2018participate[d]\u2019 in \na wrongful act so as to help \u2018make it succeed.\u2019\u201d  Twitter, \nInc. v. Taamneh, 598 U.S. 471, 493 (2023) (quoting \nNye & Nissen v. United States, 326 U.S. 613, 619 \n(1949)).  And \u201cJASTA further restricts secondary \nliability by requiring that the \u2018act of international \nterrorism\u2019 be \u2018committed, planned, or authorized by\u2019 a \nforeign terrorist organization designated as such \u2018as of \nthe date on which such act of international terrorism \nwas committed, planned, or authorized.\u2019\u201d  Id. at 495 \n(quoting 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2333(d)(2)).  \u201cThus, it is not \nenough . . . that a defendant have given substantial \nassistance to a transcendent \u2018enterprise\u2019 separate \nfrom and floating above all the actionable wrongs that \nconstitute it.  Rather, a defendant must have aided \nand abetted (by knowingly providing substantial \nassistance) another person in the commission of the \nactionable wrong\u2014here, an act of international \nterrorism.\u201d  Id.  \nUnder JASTA, one of the three elements for aiding-\nand-abetting liability is that \u201cthe defendant must be \ngenerally aware of his role as part of an overall illegal \nor tortious activity at the time that he provides the \nassistance \n(the \n\u2018general \nawareness\u2019 \nelement).\u201d  \nPet.App.33 (cleaned up); see also Twitter, 598 U.S. at \n486, 487, 503.  Accordingly, to state a claim, \nRespondents \nneeded \nto \nplausibly \nallege \nthat \nPetitioner was aware of a link between the Three \nCustomers and Hamas at the time Petitioner provided \nservices to them.  But they failed to do so.  \n \n\n7 \n \nBefore moving to dismiss Respondents\u2019 complaint, \nPetitioner submitted a three-page letter summarizing \nthe grounds for its contemplated motion to dismiss, as \nrequired by the District Court\u2019s Individual Practices.  \nMot. for Pre-Motion Conference, Honickman, et al. v. \nBLOM Bank SAL, No. 1:19-cv-00008-KAM-SMG \n(E.D.N.Y. May 8, 2019), ECF No. 20.  One of \nPetitioner\u2019s principal arguments was that the \ncomplaint did not plausibly allege the general \nawareness element needed to state their JASTA claim.  \nId. at 2.  This argument, in turn, relied on the \ncomplaint\u2019s failure to allege that Petitioner was aware \nof any connection between the Three Customers and \nHamas before the attacks.  In response, Respondents \nchose not to amend; they instead stood on the \nallegations in their complaint.  Mot. to Adjourn \nConference, Honickman, et al. v. BLOM Bank SAL, \nNo. 1:19-cv-00008-KAM-SMG (E.D.N.Y. June 5, \n2019), ECF No. 30.   \nAt a pre-motion conference, the District Court \nasked Respondents\u2019 counsel: \u201cAre there any additional \nfacts you could add to the allegations that the \ndefendant is challenging here or are you comfortable \nstanding on your complaint as it is?\u201d  Pet.App.93 \n(emphasis added).  Respondents\u2019 counsel declined the \nCourt\u2019s invitation: \u201cNo, I think we are prepared to \nbrief it based on the arguments presented in the pre-\nmotion letter.\u201d  Id.  The Court then asked whether \nRespondents would seek leave to amend if the Court \ngranted Petitioner\u2019s motion to dismiss.  Respondents\u2019 \nCounsel unequivocally stated that they \u201cwould not \nseek leave to amend.\u201d  Pet.App.94. \n\n8 \n \nAfter the conference, the District Court issued an \nOrder memorializing the fact that the \u201cCourt offered \n[Respondents] \nan \nopportunity \nto \namend \ntheir \ncomplaint to add additional information in response to \nthe arguments raised by [Petitioner],\u201d but they \n\u201cdeclined to do so and represented that they would not \nbe seeking to amend their Complaint in this regard.\u201d  \nMinute Entry & Scheduling Order, Honickman, et al. \nv. BLOM Bank SAL, No. 1:19-cv-00008-KAM-SMG \n(E.D.N.Y. May 15, 2019).  \nConsistent with its pre-motion letter, Petitioner \nmoved to dismiss, based on, among other things, the \ncomplaint\u2019s failure to plausibly suggest that Petitioner \nknew of the Three Customers\u2019 purported affiliation \nwith Hamas before the alleged attacks.  See, e.g., \nMemo. in Supp. of Mot. to Dismiss, Honickman, et al. \nv. BLOM Bank SAL, No. 1:19-cv-00008-KAM-SMG \n(E.D.N.Y. July 30, 2019), ECF No. 36-1 at 1, 8, 9, 18.  \nRespondents once again stood on their papers.  See \nMemo. in Opp. to Mot. to Dismiss, Honickman, et al. \nv. BLOM Bank SAL, No. 1:19-cv-00008-KAM-SMG \n(E.D.N.Y. July 30, 2019), ECF No. 37 at 18.  They did \nnot move to amend or ask for an opportunity to replead \nshould the District Court find their allegations \nlacking. \nThe District Court then held oral argument.  \nPet.App.100.  There, Petitioner\u2019s counsel again \nemphasized the complaint\u2019s failure to connect the \nThree Customers to Hamas \u201cat the time of any of the \nattacks.\u201d  Pet.App.109.  \u201cAt the very most, what the \ncomplaint alleges is that BLOM provided financial \nservices to three entities, two of which were later \ndetermined by the U.S. government to have provided \n\n9 \n \nfinancial support to [Hamas].\u201d  Pet.App.108 (emphasis \nadded). \nThe District Court pressed Respondents\u2019 counsel \non this point, asking \u201c[w]here do you allege in your \ncomplaint that BLOM Bank knew that these account \nholders are alter egos or are a part of, or the same as \n[Hamas]?\u201d  Pet.App.121.  The District Court then \noffered Respondents\u2019 counsel yet another opportunity \nto amend the complaint, specifically with respect to \nPetitioner\u2019s alleged \u201cknowledge\u201d: \nThe Court: So everything I need to consider \nin terms of sufficiency of your pleading is \ngoing to be found in the complaint that\u2019s \nfiled in this case, correct? \nMr. Radine: Yes, Your Honor.  The\u2014 \nThe Court: There are no facts that you would \nhave to offer to address some of the \ncontentions of the defendants regarding \nknowledge, especially? \nMr. Radine: I think we could always add \nallegations, \nbut \nthe\u2014we \nbelieve \nthe \ncomplaint goes far enough in saying that \nBLOM . . . was generally aware of its role in \nth[e] [il]licit conduct . . . . \nPet.App.124-25 (emphasis added). \nThe District Court granted Petitioner\u2019s motion to \ndismiss, holding that Respondents had not \u201cplausibly \nallege[d] that BLOM was generally aware of any \nconnection between the Three Customers and Hamas\u201d \n\u201cat the time it provided financial services to the Three \nCustomers.\u201d  Pet.App.73.   \n\n10 \n \nThe court noted that it \u201ctypically grants plaintiffs \nan opportunity to amend their complaints following \ndismissal, to address any deficiencies raised by the \nCourt\u2019s order.\u201d  Pet.App.85.  However, here, \nRespondents \u201c[did] not request leave to amend, and \nspecifically declined the Court\u2019s offer to do so.\u201d  Id.  \nAccordingly, \u201c[i]n light of [Respondents\u2019] rejection of \nthe opportunity to amend their pleading at the pre-\nmotion conference, and the fact that they ha[d] not \nidentified any additional facts they could allege which \nwould address the deficiencies in their complaint,\u201d the \nDistrict Court dismissed the complaint with prejudice.  \nPet.App.86. \nB. Respondents\u2019 Initial Appeal To The Second \nCircuit \nRather than request leave to amend, Respondents \nappealed.  In that appeal, they did not challenge the \nDistrict Court\u2019s decision to dismiss without leave to \namend.  Instead, they doubled down on their \nargument that their existing allegations were \nsufficient.  After oral argument, the Second Circuit \nheld the appeal in abeyance pending its decision in \nKaplan v. Lebanese Canadian Bank, SAL, 999 F.3d \n842 (2d Cir. 2021).  Then, after issuing the Kaplan \ndecision\u2014which clarified that Circuit\u2019s view of \nJASTA\u2019s elements\u2014the Second Circuit ordered the \nparties to submit supplemental briefs addressing the \nsignificance of that decision.  Arg. Notice, Honickman, \net al. v. BLOM Bank SAL, No. 20-575 (2d Cir. Nov. 10, \n2020), Dkt. No. 90.  At this point, Respondents had yet \nanother opportunity to ask for a remand and leave to \namend in light of Kaplan.  Once again, they did \nneither and instead relied on the allegations in their \n\n11 \n \ncomplaint to argue that those allegations state a \nclaim.  See generally Appellants\u2019 Post-Arg. Br., \nHonickman, et al. v. BLOM Bank SAL, No. 20-575 (2d \nCir. July 9, 2021), Dkt. No. 98, at 1-16. \nThe Second Circuit affirmed the District Court\u2019s \ndismissal because the complaint\u2019s \u201callegations [did] \nnot support an inference that BLOM Bank was aware \nof the Three Customers\u2019 ties with Hamas prior to the \nrelevant attacks.\u201d  Pet.App.49.  Respondents did not \nseek rehearing or even belatedly request that the \nSecond Circuit modify its decision to remand and \npermit leave to amend the complaint. \nC. The Post-Judgment Proceedings \nRespondents then returned to the District Court \nand moved to vacate the District Court\u2019s now-affirmed \njudgment so they could amend their complaint.  Mot. \nfor Pre-Mot. Conference to Vacate Judgment & Amend \nCompl., Honickman, et al. v. BLOM Bank SAL, No. \n1:19-cv-00008-KAM-SMG (E.D.N.Y. Aug. 9, 2021), \nECF No. 50.  The District Court held a pre-motion \nconference, and then ordered briefing \u201conly as to the \nissue of vacatur.\u201d  Scheduling Order, Honickman, et \nal. v. BLOM Bank SAL, No. 1:19-cv-00008-KAM-SMG \n(E.D.N.Y. Dec. 7, 2021).  After briefing, the District \nCourt held that \u201cplaintiffs have not demonstrated any \nextraordinary circumstances warranting relief under \nRule 60(b)(6).\u201d  Pet.App.14.  It also held that \nRespondents had not demonstrated that they would \nsuffer an \u201cextreme and undue hardship\u201d from letting \nthe judgment stand because they \u201chave had ample \nopportunity to pursue all legal avenues available to \nthem for relief.\u201d  Pet.App.16. \n\n12 \n \nRespondents appealed again.  After oral argument \nin that appeal, the Second Circuit issued its decision \nin Mandala v. NTT Data, Inc., 88 F.4th 353 (2d Cir. \n2023), reh\u2019g en banc denied (2d Cir. Feb. 13, 2024).  See \nPet.App.161-92.  There, a split panel held that, when \na losing party seeks post-judgment relief under Rule \n60(b)(6) to amend its complaint, the district court \nmust balance Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s finality principles with \nRule \n15(a)(2)\u2019s \n\u201cliberal \namendment \npolicy.\u201d  \nPet.App.176.  And, where a losing party has not yet \nfiled an amended complaint, the Second Circuit held \nthat it is an abuse of discretion for a district court to \ndeny a Rule 60(b)(6) motion based solely on the \nmovant\u2019s \u201cfailure to demonstrate adequate grounds for \nrelief under Rule 60.\u201d  Pet.App.17 & n.5.  In doing so, \nthe court flipped the burden from Rule 60 movants \n(who \nnormally \nmust \nprove \nextraordinary \ncircumstances) to their opponent (to show that the \nmovant should not receive another bite at the apple).  \nAs Judge Sullivan explained in dissent, the Second \nCircuit\u2019s rule \u201cundermines the principle that Rule \n60(b)(6) affords litigants an extraordinary remedy and \neffectively holds that such relief is available in the \nordinary course.\u201d  Pet.App.190. \nIn this case, the Second Circuit reaffirmed \nMandala\u2019s rule.  It held that \u201cthe district court \nexceeded its discretion by basing its ruling on an \nerroneous view of the law because it failed to balance \nRule 60(b)\u2019s finality principles and Rule 15(a)\u2019s liberal \npleading principles.\u201d  Pet.App.7-8.  \u201c[W]hen presented \nwith a motion to vacate and amend,\u201d the Second \nCircuit explained, \u201cthe district court is required to \nconsider Rule 60(b) finality and Rule 15(a) liberality \nin tandem.\u201d  Pet.App.7.  Thus, applying Mandala, the \n\n13 \n \nSecond Circuit faulted the District Court for analyzing \nthe Rule 60(b) motion \u201cunder only Rule 60(b)\u2019s \nstandard.\u201d  Id. \nREASONS FOR GRANTING THE PETITION \nThe Second Circuit\u2019s dilution of Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s \nstringent \nstandard \nconflicts \nwith \nthis \nCourt\u2019s \nprecedents and decisions from eleven other Circuits.  \nIt also opens a dangerous loophole threatening to \nundermine the finality of judgments in the federal \ncourts.  Rather than allow this problematic circuit \nsplit to persist, this Court should grant certiorari and \nswiftly reverse. \nI. \nThe Second Circuit\u2019s Rule Conflicts With \nThe Decisions Of Eleven Other Circuits. \nThis Court has long recognized the compelling \ninterest in protecting the finality of judgments under \nthe Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  Consistent with \nthose principles, Rule 60(b)(6) presents unsuccessful \nlitigants with only \u201cnarrow grounds for obtaining post-\njudgment relief.\u201d  Leisure Caviar, LLC v. U.S. Fish & \nWildlife Serv., 616 F.3d 612, 616 (6th Cir. 2010) \n(Sutton, J.).  Rule 60(b)(6) may be used to reopen a \njudgment only when the movant demonstrates \n\u201cextraordinary circumstances.\u201d  Gonzalez, 545 U.S. at \n535.  But in the Second Circuit\u2019s view, the \u201cliberal \nspirit of Rule 15(a)\u201d generally entitles litigants whose \ncomplaints have been dismissed with prejudice a \nchance to vacate the dismissal under Rule 60(b)(6) to \namend\u2014even after the judgment has been affirmed on \nappeal.  Pet.App.175.  This view places the Second \nCircuit alone among the Circuits.  The First, Third, \nFourth, Fifth, Sixth, Seventh, Eighth, Ninth, Tenth, \nEleventh, and D.C. Circuits have taken the opposite \n\n14 \n \napproach.  And the Second Circuit has already refused \nto reconsider its rule en banc.  Thus, only this Court \ncan restore uniformity on this important question. \nThe circuit split here could not be more clear.  In \nfact, when considering the issue at the same time as \nthe Second Circuit, the Fourth Circuit observed that \nadopting the Second Circuit\u2019s approach would have \nput it \u201calone in the Nation in collapsing the Rule 60(b) \nstandard \nwith \nthe \nstandard \nfor \nRule \n15(a).\u201d  \nDaulatzai, 97 F.4th at 177.  The Fourth Circuit \nacknowledged that dicta from one of its previous \ndecisions could be misunderstood as endorsing the \nSecond Circuit\u2019s mistaken view.  But, in Daulatzai, \nthe Fourth Circuit emphatically rejected that \napproach.  Id.  Instead, the Fourth Circuit held that \nthe \u201cmore restrictive standard\u201d for granting a Rule \n60(b) motion \u201cmust be satisfied before consideration \ncan be given to a motion to amend.\u201d  Id. at 179 \n(emphasis added).  There is no way to square that rule \nwith the Second Circuit\u2019s contrary rule that district \ncourts are \u201crequired to consider Rule 60(b) finality and \nRule 15(a) liberality in tandem.\u201d  Pet.App.7 (emphasis \nadded). \nThe Sixth Circuit has likewise rejected the Second \nCircuit\u2019s approach.  It has held that, in this situation, \n\u201c[i]nstead of meeting only the modest requirements of \nRule 15, [a plaintiff] must meet the requirements for \nreopening a case established by Rule [60].\u201d  Moreland \nv. Robinson, 813 F.3d 315, 327 (6th Cir. 2016) (citation \nomitted).  And it has appropriately treated the Rule 60 \nand Rule 15 requirements as distinct hurdles.  See id.  \nThat is, plaintiffs \u201cmust first meet the threshold \nrequirement of 60(b)(6)\u2019s extraordinary or exceptional \n\n15 \n \ncircumstances to vacate the judgment before seeking\u201d \nto amend their pleadings.  In re Ferro Corp. Deriv. \nLitig., 511 F.3d 611, 624 (6th Cir. 2008).  Otherwise, \nas Judge Sutton has explained, plaintiffs could \n\u201csidestep the narrow grounds for obtaining post-\njudgment relief\u201d under Rule 60, \u201cmake the finality of \njudgments an interim concept,\u201d and risk turning Rule \n60 into a \u201cnullit[y].\u201d  Leisure Caviar, 616 F.3d at 616. \nThe Third Circuit has also rejected the Second \nCircuit\u2019s approach.  Instead, the Third Circuit has \nheld that, when a plaintiff seeks to \u201creopen a final \njudgment,\u201d as here, \u201cthe policy favoring the finality of \njudgments [is] implicated,\u201d and \u201c[t]he permissive \npolicy favoring amendment under Rule 15 [is] simply \nnot relevant.\u201d  Garrett v. Wexford Health, 938 F.3d 69, \n86 (3d Cir. 2019) (emphasis added).  Indeed, the Third \nCircuit has repeatedly applied those principles to deny \npost-judgment relief in cases like this one.  For \ninstance, in Dominos Pizza LLC v. Deak, 534 F. App\u2019x \n171 (3d Cir. 2013), the district court dismissed a \ndefendant\u2019s amended counterclaim without prejudice \nbut the defendant\u2014like the Respondents here\u2014made \nthe deliberate decision not to file a second amended \ncounterclaim.  Id. at 173.  The defendant instead \nappealed to the Third Circuit, where he lost.  Id.   \nAfter failing on appeal, the Deak defendant moved \nunder Rules 15(a) and 60(b)(6) to reopen proceedings \nso he could amend his counterclaim.  Id. at 173-74.  \nBut the district court denied that request because the \ndefendant \u201chad ample opportunity to attempt to \nreassert his counterclaim . . . while the case was open, \nbut he failed to do so.\u201d  Id.  The Third Circuit affirmed, \nholding that \u201ccourts must deny relief under Rule \n\n16 \n \n60(b)(6) unless extraordinary circumstances are \npresent,\u201d \nwhile \nemphasizing \nthat \n\u201cthe \nliberal \nstandards \nof \nRule \n15\u201d \ndo \nnot \n\u201cdemonstrate \nextraordinary circumstances justifying relief under \nRule 60(b)(6).\u201d  Id. at 174.  The court also agreed that \nthe plaintiff had \u201cample opportunity\u201d to amend his \ncomplaint but \u201cdid not move to do so until after the \ncase was closed,\u201d and suggested that it was the \nplaintiff\u2019s \u201cdeliberate choices\u201d that resulted in the \nclosing of the case.  Id. at 174, 175.  The Third Circuit \nthus applied \u201cthe framework of Rule 60(b)(6)\u201d to deny \npost-judgment relief.  Id. at 174; see also Atkinson v. \nMiddlesex Cnty., 610 F. App\u2019x 109, 112 n.6 (3d Cir. \n2015).  That case would have come out the other way \nunder the Second Circuit\u2019s approach. \nThe Eleventh Circuit recently rejected the \napproach taken by the Second Circuit.  In MacPhee v. \nMiMedx Group, Inc., 73 F.4th 1220 (11th Cir. 2023), \nthat court held that applying Rule 15(a)(2)\u2019s standard \nis \u201cinappropriate . . . [if] dismissal of the complaint \nalso constitutes dismissal of the action.\u201d  Id. at 1249-\n50 (citation omitted).  That is because Rule 60(b)(6) \u201cis \nan extraordinary remedy and requires a showing of \n\u2018extraordinary circumstances\u2019 to justify the reopening \nof a final judgment.\u201d  Id. at 1251.  And the court \nexplicitly clarified that this held true even for \u201cpost-\njudgment motions to amend where the plaintiff has \nnot exercised its right under Rule 15(a)(1) to amend as \na matter of course.\u201d  Id. at 1250; see also Caterpillar \nFin. Servs. Corp. v. Venequip Mach. Sales Corp., 2023 \nWL 8258886, at *1-2, 4 (S.D. Fla. Nov. 29, 2023) \n(applying MacPhee and refusing to allow post-\njudgment amendment \u201cbased on [plaintiff\u2019s] good faith \nbelief that it had advanced an actionable complaint\u201d).  \n\n17 \n \nThe D.C. Circuit has long concluded that \u201cRule \n60(b)(6) is not an opportunity for unsuccessful \nlitigants to take a mulligan.\u201d  Kramer v. Gates, 481 \nF.3d 788, 792 (D.C. Cir. 2007).  In Building Industrial \nAssociation of Superior California v. Norton, that \ncourt \nreasoned \nthat \n\u201c[o]rdinarily \npostjudgment \namendment of a complaint under Rule 15(a) requires \nreopening of the judgment pursuant to Rule 59(e) or \n60(b).\u201d  247 F.3d 1241, 1245 (D.C. Cir. 2001) \n(Silberman, J.).  And it explained that this approach \n\u201cprevents litigants from resurrecting claims on which \nthey have lost.\u201d  Id.; see also Black Lives Matter D.C. \nv. Trump, --- F. Supp. 3d ---, 2024 WL 1091730, at *6-\n7 (D.D.C. Mar. 13, 2024) (Friedrich, J.). \nThe Ninth Circuit agrees, too.  In Lindauer v. \nRogers, 91 F.3d 1355 (9th Cir. 1996), that court \n\u201cadopt[ed] the requirement that, once judgment has \nbeen entered in a case, a motion to amend the \ncomplaint can only be entertained if the judgment is \nfirst reopened under a motion brought under Rule 59 \nor 60.\u201d  Id. at 1357.  That is because, \u201c[i]n contrast to \nthe \u2018freely give[n] dispensation to amend in Rule 15, \nRule 60(b) relief should be granted \u2018sparingly\u2019 to avoid \n\u2018manifest injustice\u2019 and \u2018only where extraordinary \ncircumstances prevented a party from taking timely \naction to prevent or correct an erroneous judgment.\u2019\u201d \nNavajo Nation v. Dep\u2019t of the Interior, 876 F.3d 1144, \n1173 (9th Cir. 2017) (quoting United States v. Alpine \nLand & Reservoir Co., 984 F.2d 1047, 1049 (9th Cir. \n1993)).  Recently in 3WL, LLC v. Master Protection, \nLP, 851 F. App\u2019x 4 (9th Cir. 2021), the Ninth Circuit \napplied that rule to conclude that a \u201cdistrict court \nproperly denied [a] motion\u201d to vacate the judgment \nwhere the movant had \u201cpaid only lip service to this \n\n18 \n \nimportant distinction\u201d between Rule 60 and Rule 15.  \nId. at 8.  Because the movant had not satisfied Rule \n60, \u201cthere was no basis to reach the Rule 15 issue.\u201d  Id.; \nsee also In re Netflix, Inc. Secs. Litig, 647 F. App\u2019x 813, \n816 (9th Cir. 2016) (\u201c[B]ecause Plaintiffs have not \ncleared the high bar necessary to warrant relief under \nRule[] 59 or Rule 60, the district court had no need to \neven consider Plaintiffs\u2019 Rule 15 motion.\u201d). \nOther Circuits have reached similar conclusions.  \nThe Seventh Circuit has held that \u201cthe relative merits \nof [a] Rule 15(a) motion will not affect the judge\u2019s \ndecision with regard to [a] Rule [60(b)] motion.\u201d  Helm \nv. Resol. Tr. Corp., 84 F.3d 874, 879 (7th Cir. 1996).  \nThe Tenth Circuit has concluded that a post-judgment \nmotion to amend under Rule 15(a) \u201cwould not be \nallowed until the judgment was set aside or vacated \npursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 59 or 60.\u201d  Cooper v. \nShumway, 780 F.2d 27, 28 (10th Cir. 1985) (per \ncuriam).  The Eighth Circuit has also recently stressed \nthat leave to amend may be granted only if \u201cconsistent \nwith the stringent standards governing the grant of \nRule 59(e) and Rule 60(b) relief.\u201d  UMB Bank, N.A. v. \nGuerin, 89 F.4th 1047, 1057 (8th Cir. 2024) (citation \nomitted).  The Fifth Circuit has held that \u201c[w]hen a \ndistrict court dismisses an action and enters a final \njudgment . . . a plaintiff may request leave to amend \nonly by either appealing the judgment, or seeking to \nalter or reopen the judgment under Rule 59 or 60.\u201d  \nRosenzweig v. Azurix Corp., 332 F.3d 854, 864 (5th Cir. \n2003); see also Briddle v. Scott, 63 F.3d 364, 379-80 \n(5th Cir. 1995).   And the First Circuit has long refused \nto \u201callow plaintiffs to pursue a case to judgment and \nthen, if they lose, to reopen the case by amending their \ncomplaint to take account of the court\u2019s decision.\u201d  \n\n19 \n \nJames v. Watt, 716 F.2d 71, 78 (1st Cir. 1983) (Breyer, \nJ.).  As then-Judge Breyer explained, permitting \n\u201c[s]uch a practice would dramatically undermine the \nordinary rules governing the finality of judicial \ndecisions.\u201d  Id.; see also Fisher v. Kadant, Inc., 589 \nF.3d 505, 509, 512-14 (1st Cir. 2009). \nThe Second Circuit\u2019s decision cannot be reconciled \nwith this wall of contrary precedents from the other \nCircuits.1  And, by denying en banc review in Mandala \nand applying the rule in this case, that court has left \nno doubt that the circuit split will persist absent this \nCourt\u2019s immediate intervention and correction.  \nPet.App.193-94. \nII. The Second Circuit\u2019s Rule Conflicts With \nThis Court\u2019s Precedents. \nNot only does the Second Circuit\u2019s outlier approach \nconflict with the decisions of other Circuits, but it is at \nodds with over a century of this Court\u2019s jurisprudence \nprotecting the finality of judgments.   \nIn 1897, this Court explained that \u201cthe aid of \njudicial tribunals would not be invoked for the \nvindication of rights of persons and property, if . . . \nconclusiveness did not attend the judgments of such \ntribunals.\u201d  S. Pac. R.R. v. United States, 168 U.S. 1, \n49 (1897).  In the 127 years since, this Court has \nrepeatedly emphasized that finality of judgments is \ncritical to any effective and orderly judicial system.  \nSee, e.g., Yeager v. United States, 557 U.S. 110, 118 \n \n1 Because the Federal Circuit \u201capplies the law of the respective \nregional circuit on questions of procedure,\u201d Gen. Protecht Trp., \nInc. v. Leviton Mfg. Co., 651 F.3d 1355, 1359 (Fed. Cir. 2011), the \nSecond Circuit\u2019s view conflicts with all other Circuits. \n\n20 \n \n(2009) (reiterating \u201cinterest [in] the preservation of \n\u2018the finality of judgments.\u2019\u201d) (quoting Crist v. Bretz, \n437 U.S. 28, 33 (1978)); United States v. Denedo, 556 \nU.S. 904, 916 (2009) (\u201c[J]udgment finality is not to be \nlightly cast aside.\u201d). \nThat respect for finality applies with particular \nforce when evaluating motions for relief from \njudgments under Rule 60.  \u201cThere must be an end to \nlitigation someday, and free, calculated, deliberate \nchoices\u201d that result in a final judgment are thus \u201cnot \nto be relieved from.\u201d  Ackermann, 340 U.S. at 198.  \nBecause Rule 60(b)(6) is a catchall for relief on bases \nother than those in Rule 60(b)(1)-(5), \u201cextraordinary \ncircumstances must justify reopening.\u201d  Kemp v. \nUnited States, 596 U.S. 528, 533 (2022) (quoting \nLiljeberg v. Health Servs. Acquisition Corp., 486 U.S. \n847, 863 n.11 (1988) (cleaned up)).  This Court has \nemphasized that principle time and again.  See, e.g., \nTharpe v. Sellers, 583 U.S. 33, 35 (2018); Buck v. \nDavis, 580 U.S. 100, 123 (2017); Pioneer Inv. Servs., \n507 U.S. at 393; Liljeberg, 486 U.S. 863 & n.11; \nKlapprott v. United States, 335 U.S. 601, 613\u201314 \n(1949).  And this Court has left no room for Rule 15\u2019s \nliberal amendment policy to creep into that equation.  \nFor good reason:  The \u201cdrafters of the rules included \nRules 59(e) and 60(b) specifically to provide a \nmechanism for those situations in which relief must \nbe obtained after judgment and the broad amendment \npolicy of Rule 15(a) should not be construed in a \nmanner \nthat \nwould \nrender \nthose \nprovisions \nmeaningless.\u201d  6 Wright & Miller, Fed. Prac. & Proc. \nCiv. \u00a7 1489 (3d ed.).  \u201cTo hold otherwise would enable \nthe liberal amendment policy of Rule 15(a) to be \nemployed in a way that is contrary to the philosophy \n\n21 \n \nfavoring finality of judgments and the expeditious \ntermination of litigation.\u201d  Id. \nIn addition, this Court has likewise stressed that, \nto \nqualify \nfor \nrelief, \nthe \n\u201c\u2018extraordinary \ncircumstances\u2019\u201d must \u201csuggest[] that the party is \nfaultless in the delay.\u201d  Pioneer Inv. Servs., 507 U.S. at \n393 (citation omitted).  Parties \u201ccannot be relieved of \n[their] choice[s]\u201d simply \u201cbecause hindsight seems to \nindicate\u201d \nthe \nimprovidence \nof \nsuch \ndecisions.  \nAckermann, 340 U.S. at 198; see also 11 Wright & \nMiller, Fed. Prac. & Proc. Civ. \u00a7 2857 (3d ed.) (\u201cThe \ncases show that although the courts have sought to \naccomplish justice, they have administered Rule 60(b) \nwith a scrupulous regard for the aims of finality.\u201d). \nThe Second Circuit\u2019s novel approach is squarely at \nodds with this Court\u2019s decisions.  By requiring district \ncourts to consider Rule 15\u2019s liberality policy \u201cin \ntandem\u201d with Rule 60\u2019s finality principles\u2014even when \na movant has rejected numerous opportunities to \namend before final judgment (and during appeal)\u2014the \nSecond Circuit is instructing district courts to relieve \nmovants of their \u201cfree, calculated, deliberate choices.\u201d  \nAckermann, 340 U.S. at 198.  That is precisely the sort \nof unfair and inefficient feedback loop that this Court \nhas repeatedly warned against.  This Court should \ngrant certiorari to confirm the importance of the \nfinality of judgments and restore the universal rule \nthat Rule 60(b)(6) relief may not be used as a do-over \nto remedy poor litigation decisions. \n\n22 \n \nIII. The Question Presented Is Exceptionally \nImportant, And This Case Is A Clean Vehicle \nFor Resolving It.  \nThe question presented is of critical importance to \nthe principles of fairness, efficiency, and finality that \nanimate the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  The \nmajority approach rightly requires plaintiffs to put \ntheir best complaint forward before judgment\u2014or risk \nan end to their lawsuit.  That emphasis on finality \n\u201cincreases the efficiency of the judicial system\u201d and \n\u201cincreases the integrity of the system by maintaining \nrespect for the judicial process.\u201d  Jill E. Fisch, \nRewriting History: The Propriety of Eradicating Prior \nDecisional Law Through Settlement and Vacatur, 76 \nCornell L. Rev. 589, 591 (1991).  It also furthers the \nguiding principle of the Federal Rules of Civil \nProcedure\u2014\u201cto \nsecure \nthe \njust, \nspeedy, \nand \ninexpensive determination of every action and \nproceeding.\u201d  Fed. R. Civ. P. 1.   \nThe Second Circuit\u2019s standard flips those deeply \nrooted tenets on their head.  It eschews finality and \nundermines confidence in the outcome of litigation.  \nPlaintiffs in the Second Circuit can now \u201cuse the court \nas a sounding board to discover holes in their \narguments, then reopen the case by amending their \ncomplaint to take account of the court\u2019s decisions,\u201d \neven after testing the complaint against a full appeal \nand after repeatedly declining earlier opportunities to \namend.  Leisure Caviar, 616 F.3d at 616 (cleaned up).  \nSuch gamesmanship will inevitably draw out \nlitigation and waste scarce judicial resources.  See \nPet.App.192 (Sullivan, J., dissenting).  That is why \ncourts have long rejected such belated attempts at \n\n23 \n \namendment and reserved Rule 60(b)(6) relief for only \ntruly \u201ccompelling circumstances.\u201d  Watt, 716 F.2d at \n78 (Breyer, J.). \nIt is thus essential for this Court to clarify the legal \nframework that governs a Rule 60(b)(6) motion \nseeking to reboot a case with a post-judgment (and \npost-appeal) amendment to the complaint.  As it \nstands now, litigants in all but three States are held \nto Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s strict standard when seeking post-\njudgment relief.  Litigants within the Second Circuit, \nhowever, face a dramatically lower burden. The \nfinality of a judgment should not change based on the \nmere happenstance of geography. \nMoreover, the volume and significance of cases \nfiled within the Second Circuit exacerbates that threat \nto orderly and efficient litigation.  That is because \n\u201c[t]he Second Circuit\u2014surely owing to its location in \nmajor business centers\u2014sees a greater percentage of \nprivate civil cases than any of its sister circuits.\u201d  \nMerritt E. McAlister, Rebuilding the Federal Circuit \nCourts, 116 Nw. U. L. Rev. 1137, 1184 (2022).   \nOne prime example is the universe of lawsuits \ninvoking the ATA and JASTA.  Based on Petitioner\u2019s \nresearch, there appear to be 90 civil actions that have \nasserted claims under the ATA, and 55 of them have \nbeen filed in district courts in the Second Circuit.  Of \nnote, the law firm representing plaintiffs in this case \nis responsible for at least 17 of those cases\u2014nearly \n19%.2  ATA complaints frequently run hundreds of \n \n2 Tellingly, in many of the other ATA cases brought by \nRespondents\u2019 counsel, they have filed amended complaints in the \nordinary course of litigation.

As a result of the Second \nCircuit\u2019s decision, the high volume of ATA cases, most \nfrequently filed in the Second Circuit, will now be \namenable to enhanced gamesmanship through a \npotentially endless loop of judgment, appeal, and \namendment. \n \n(S.D.N.Y.

The volume \nand complexity of cases within the Second Circuit cuts \nacross all areas of civil litigation.  For instance, as of \n2018, \u201c[s]tudies indicate that the highest volume of \nsecurities cases filed in the United States is recorded \nin the\u201d Southern District of New York.

Pol\u2019y 365, 393 n.166 (2018) (explaining \nthat \u201cthe Second Circuit saw more than 1.5x the \namount of securities class actions filings than the next \nhighest circuit in 2017\u201d).  In the wake of the 2008 \nfinancial crisis, a majority of related class actions were \nfiled in the Second Circuit.  Denise Mazzeo, Note, \nSecurities Class Actions, CAFA, and a Countrywide \nCrisis: A Call For Clarity and Consistency, 78 \nFordham L. Rev. 1433, 1461 & n.216 (2009); Shrey \nSharma, Note, Do the Second Circuit\u2019s Legal \nStandards on Class Certification Incentivize Forum \nShopping?: A Comparative Analysis of the Second \nCircuit\u2019s \nClass \nCertification \nJurisprudence, \n85 \nFordham L. Rev. 877, 883 n.43 (2016) (\u201c[T]he Second \nCircuit naturally may see more securities filings \nbecause it encompasses all of New York City.\u201d). \nThe Second Circuit also attracts a significant \namount of antitrust lawsuits.  See Bernadette Berger, \nComment, Shut Up and Pitch: Major League \nBaseball\u2019s Power Struggle With Minor League Players \nin Senne v. Kansas City Royals Baseball Corp., 28 \nJeffrey S. Moorad Sports L.J. 53, 83 (2021).  These \n\n26 \n \nsorts of complex lawsuits are notoriously expensive as \nit stands.  See, e.g., Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 \nU.S. 544, 558-59 (2007).  The Second Circuit\u2019s ill-\nconsidered rule promises to multiply that expense and \nthe related burden on judicial resources. \nFinally, this case is a good vehicle to decide this \nstraightforward and significant legal question.  There \nis no doubt that the issue is both clearly presented and \ncase-dispositive here.  Although the decision below \nwas unpublished, it followed closely behind the \npublished Second Circuit decision that controlled the \noutcome\u2014which demonstrates that the issue is \nrecurring and confirms that the Second Circuit stands \nout of step with this Court\u2019s precedents and the \nuniform view of the other Circuits.3   \nUltimately, this case turns on a clear, case-\ndispositive issue that is now subject to a lopsided \ncircuit split.  Had the Second Circuit followed the \nFirst, Third, Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, Seventh, Eighth, \nNinth, Tenth, Eleventh, and D.C. Circuits, then \nPetitioner would have prevailed below.  And the facts \nhere\u2014where Respondents repeatedly declined to \namend their complaint in the normal course\u2014only \nplace the issue in stark relief.  This Court should thus \ngrant certiorari and reverse, in order to restore \nuniformity on this important issue. \nCONCLUSION \nThe Court should grant the petition for a writ of \ncertiorari. \n \n3 In Mandala, the Second Circuit denied the defendant\u2019s request \nfor rehearing or rehearing en banc.

This observation refines my understanding significantly by identifying the core legal issue. The case is not primarily about the substance of the Anti-Terrorism Act, but rather a procedural conflict between two Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The central tension is between the stringent standard of Rule 60(b)(6), which allows for relief from a final judgment only under \"extraordinary circumstances,\" and the liberal standard of Rule 15(a), which encourages courts to \"freely give leave\" to amend complaints. The specific legal question the Supreme Court will likely address is which of these standards governs when a plaintiff, whose case has been dismissed by a final judgment, asks the court to vacate that judgment for the express purpose of filing an amended complaint. My focus for prediction must now be on how the Court will resolve this procedural clash, likely by examining the text, history, and purpose of these rules and the principle of judgment finality.",

For the petitioner, the Petition for a Writ of Certiorari is the most information-dense source for their arguments and the question presented. This establishes a clear, source-driven workflow: 1) Identify the legal conflict, 2) Analyze the petitioner's cert petition to understand their framing of the issue.

          "task_beliefs": "My prior understanding was that this case presents a procedural conflict between the stringent standard of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b)(6) for vacating final judgments (\"extraordinary circumstances\") and the liberal standard of Rule 15(a) for amending complaints (\"freely give leave\"). This observation, by providing the Petition for a Writ of Certiorari, dramatically sharpens this understanding and provides the petitioner's specific line of attack.\n\nThe petition confirms the legal question is precisely as I identified: \"Whether Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s stringent standard applies to a post-judgment request to vacate for the purpose of filing an amended complaint.\" However, it adds crucial details and arguments that strongly suggest the Supreme Court will reverse the Second Circuit. The most significant new piece of information is the petitioner's claim that the Second Circuit's new \"balancing test\" creates a deep and lopsided circuit split, putting it in conflict with **all eleven other circuits** that have addressed the issue. A claim of such a profound split is one of the most compelling reasons for the Court to grant review and impose uniformity.\n\nFurthermore, the petition frames the respondents' actions as a \"calculated, deliberate choice\" to stand on their initial complaint, having rejected \"multiple invitations and opportunities to amend.\" This narrative directly undermines any claim that the respondents are \"faultless,\" a requirement for Rule 60(b)(6) relief established in key precedents cited by the petitioner, such as *Pioneer Inv. Servs. v. Brunswick Assocs. Ltd. P\u2019ship* and *Ackermann v. United States*. The petitioner argues that the Second Circuit's rule effectively allows a losing party a second chance, which contravenes the principle of finality articulated in cases like *Gonzalez v. Crosby*. The petitioner also cites a First Circuit opinion from then-Judge Breyer (*James v. Watt*) to argue that the Federal Rules do not permit a plaintiff to lose a case and then simply reopen it by amending the complaint.\n\nBased on this, my belief has shifted from a general understanding of the conflict to a specific prediction. The combination of a claimed 11-1 circuit split, strong reliance on existing Supreme Court precedent regarding finality, and a factual narrative that paints the respondents as strategic actors rather than faultless victims makes a reversal by the Supreme Court highly probable. My focus is now on verifying the petitioner's characterization of the circuit split and understanding how the respondents will counter these powerful arguments.",
          "design_beliefs": "My initial design belief was that a core strategy is to (1) identify the central legal conflict and (2) analyze the petitioner's cert petition to understand their framing. This new observation provides powerful validation for this workflow. The cert petition proved to be the single most valuable source of information, providing not just the legal question but the entire strategic architecture of the petitioner's case: the claim of a circuit split, the key precedents, the policy arguments, and the persuasive framing of the facts.\n\nThis experience refines my design heuristics significantly:\n1.  **Validation of Source Prioritization:** The cert petition is a high-signal, primary source document. Ancillary filings like \"Certificate of Compliance\" or \"Certificate of Service,\" while procedurally necessary, are low-signal for prediction and can be deprioritized. A smart search strategy should filter for or rank the main brief higher than these procedural attachments.\n2.  **The \"Circuit Split\" Heuristic:** The most impactful argument for SCOTUS intervention is a circuit split. A new, high-priority heuristic is: **When analyzing a cert petition, the first step is to locate the \"Reasons for Granting the Petition\" and immediately identify if a circuit split is claimed. The depth and breadth of the alleged split (e.g., 11-1) is a primary indicator of the likelihood of the Court granting cert and ruling on the merits to resolve the non-uniformity.**\n3.  **Strategic Framing is Key:** Understanding the legal rules is only part of the task. The petition demonstrates that understanding *how a party frames the facts* to fit those rules (e.g., portraying the respondent as making a \"calculated choice\" to undermine their claim of being \"faultless\") is essential for predicting the outcome.\n4.  **Iterative Information Gathering:** This observation naturally points to the next steps. The petitioner has made a strong claim (an 11-1 split). The next logical actions are to (a) attempt to verify this claim by examining the cases from other circuits cited in the petition and (b) seek out the Respondent's Brief in Opposition to understand the counter-narrative and how they dispute the existence or nature of the split. This confirms that effective design is an iterative process of claim and verification."

Circuit courts generally hold that \nmeans providing an opportunity to amend once a ruling \nidentifies remediable defects, if any, in a pleading. Fail-\ning to provide that opportunity may constitute an \u201cex-\ntraordinary circumstance\u201d and a basis to vacate a judg-\nment under Rule 60(b)(6).  \nHere, the Second Circuit found that the district \ncourt dismissed Respondents\u2019 complaint by applying \nthe \u201cwrong legal standard\u201d for pleading an aiding and \nabetting claim (in the Second Circuit) under the Justice \nAgainst Sponsors of Terrorism Act, as well as a stand-\nard for pleading knowledge that was \u201ctoo exacting\u201d and \nall but impossible to meet by amendment. The circuit \ncourt provided clarified pleading standards and identi-\nfied specific, remediable defects in the complaint. Re-\nspondents then promptly moved to vacate the district \ncourt\u2019s judgment in order to meet those clarified stand-\nards in an amended complaint\u2014their first in this litiga-\ntion. The district court refused and, after Respondents \nappealed again, the circuit issued a non-precedential \nsummary order remanding the case for \u201crecon-\nsider[ation].\u201d \nThe question presented is thus whether the circuit \ncourt erred in directing the district court to reconsider \nits refusal to grant Respondents an opportunity to meet \nthe pleading standards the circuit corrected in the prior \nappeal. \n \n \n\nii \n \nTABLE OF CONTENTS \nPage \nQUESTION PRESENTED ............................................. i \nTABLE OF AUTHORITIES ......................................... iv \nINTRODUCTION .......................................................... 1 \nSTATEMENT ................................................................ 4 \nI. \nThe Complaint and Pre-Motion Conference for \nBLOM\u2019s Motion to Dismiss .............................. 4 \nII. \nThe Motion to Dismiss ..................................... 7 \nIII.

The dis-\ntrict court had denied vacatur because Plaintiffs de-\nclined its pre-dismissal invitations to amend their \ncomplaint\u2014but the circuit court found the district \ncourt was applying the \u201cwrong\u201d pleading standards, \nPet.App.5, which were so overly \u201cexacting\u201d that Plain-\ntiffs could not meet them before discovery, Pet.App.49.  \nPetitioner (\u201cBLOM\u201d) argues that by making this \nstraightforward remand, the Second Circuit has effec-\ntively \u201cabandon[ed] the \u2018extraordinary circumstances\u2019 \nstandard in favor of a nebulous \u2018balanc[ing]\u2019 inquiry \nthat pits Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s protection of \u2018finality\u2019 against \n\u2018Rule 15(a)\u2019s liberal amendment policies.\u2019\u201d Pet.Br.25 \n(quoting Pet.App.8). In BLOM\u2019s telling, the Second \nCircuit has \u201cjettisoned\u201d Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s guardrails, \nPet.Br.14., and motions for post-judgment amend-\nments will now be all but rubber-stamped in the cir-\ncuit. This is incorrect. \nFirst of all, this conclusion is not supported by the \nspare language of the summary order, which simply \ndirects the district court to \u201creconsider\u201d denying vaca-\ntur given Second Circuit and Supreme Court prece-\ndents. Nothing has been \u201cabandoned\u201d\u2014consistent \nwith decisions from this Court, \u201c[r]elief under Rule \n60(b)(6)\u201d in the Second Circuit \u201cis reserved for cases \nthat present \u2018extraordinary circumstances,\u2019\u201d including \nwhere a party seeks post-judgment amendment. Man-\ndala v. NTT Data, Inc., 88 F.4th 353, 361 (2d Cir. 2023) \n(citation omitted). Indeed, the standards the Second \n\n \n \n \n \n \n2 \n \nCircuit has \u201cdeveloped\u201d\u2014and reaffirmed by the sum-\nmary order below\u2014\u201cfor evaluating postjudgment mo-\ntions generally place significant emphasis on the \n\u2018value of finality and repose.\u2019\u201d Williams v. Citigroup \nInc., 659 F.3d 208, 213 (2d Cir. 2011) (citation omit-\nted). \nSecond, balancing finality and justice is not \u201cnebu-\nlous,\u201d as BLOM calls it, but rather inherent to Rule \n60(b)(6) jurisprudence: The rule\u2019s \u201cextraordinary cir-\ncumstances\u201d requirement \u201cexists in order to balance \nthe broad language of Rule 60(b)(6), which allows \ncourts to set aside judgments for \u2018any\u2019 reason justify-\ning relief, with the interest in the finality of judg-\nments.\u201d Budget Blinds, Inc. v. White, 536 F.3d 244, \n255 (3d Cir. 2008). When considering a motion to \namend a complaint, finality interests are \u201cbalance[d] \n. . . with the preference expressed in the Federal Rules \nof Civil Procedure in general, and Rule 15 in particu-\nlar, for resolving disputes on their merits.\u201d Krupski v. \nCosta Crociere S. p. A., 560 U.S. 538, 550 (2010).  \nThird, this case does involve truly \u201cextraordinary \ncircumstances\u201d because (1) the district court dismissed \nthe complaint using a set of \u201cwrong legal standards,\u201d \nincluding the nearly impossible requirement of alleg-\ning, without the opportunity for any discovery, \u201cacts or \nstatements\u201d of \u201cBLOM employees\u201d to demonstrate the \nbank\u2019s knowledge; (2) the circuit court rejected those \nstandards on appeal\u2014including the direct evidence re-\nquirement\u2014and \u201cclarified\u201d the correct ones; (3) the cir-\ncuit court found that Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations were none-\ntheless too \u201climited\u201d to meet the clarified standards, \ndrawing a newly announced distinction between \nPlaintiffs\u2019 \u201cpublicly available\u201d evidence and \u201cpublic \nsources such as media articles,\u201d Pet.App.50 & n.18; (4) \nthe circuit court identified several remediable defects \n\n \n \n \n \n \n3 \n \nin the complaint that the district court had not, such \nas clarifying that cash withdrawals are untraceable \nand alleging the degree to which Israeli terrorism des-\nignations were publicized; and (5) Plaintiffs had not \nyet amended their complaint even once. In these one-\nof-a-kind circumstances, the Rules\u2019 strong preference \nfor deciding cases on their merits entitles Plaintiffs to \nhave at least one opportunity to cure those defects. \nBLOM\u2019s argument is therefore premised on con-\nstruing the case\u2019s procedural history to suggest the \nSecond Circuit found that Plaintiffs \u201cwaived\u201d their \nright to amend post-judgment but nevertheless \u201cdi-\nrected district courts to override and rescue parties \nfrom their \u2018free, calculated, [and] deliberate choices,\u2019\u201d \nsuch as \u201cwhen the movant has consistently and con-\nsciously rejected numerous invitations and opportuni-\nties to amend.\u201d Pet.Br.28-29 (citations omitted).  \nBut the Second Circuit never accepted BLOM\u2019s \n\u201cwaiver\u201d argument. To the contrary, it recognized that \nPlaintiffs did not have a meaningful opportunity to \namend at all because \u201cthe district court applied the \nwrong legal standard for aiding-and-abetting liability \nunder JASTA,\u201d Pet.App.5, and a standard for pleading \nknowledge that was \u201ctoo exacting,\u201d Pet.App.49. In fact, \nthe district court\u2019s knowledge pleading standard was \nunmeetable\u2014as Circuit Court Judge Wesley noted in \nresponse to BLOM\u2019s insistence at oral argument that \nPlaintiffs waived opportunities to amend: \u201cWhat are \nthey supposed to do? They know they can\u2019t amend [to] \n. . . meet that.\u201d Oral Arg. at 11:52-:56, Honickman, No. \n22-1039 (2d Cir. Oct. 5, 2023), https://ww3.ca2. \nuscourts.gov/decisions/isysquery/6a33dfa3-27c7-4b0a-\n82ee-86c41553c09a/1/doc/22-1039.mp3. \nIgnoring this, BLOM further insists that \u201cthe Sec-\nond Circuit affirmed the dismissal on grounds that the \n\n \n \n \n \n \n4 \n \nDistrict Court had relied on,\u201d Pet.Br. 40\u2014but the dis-\ntrict court itself acknowledged that the decision was \naffirmed \u201con other grounds.\u201d Pet.App.10. Most im-\nportantly, BLOM\u2019s reading of the record is irrelevant \nto the question presented\u2014the summary order below \nwas not premised on any such finding and thus did not \ndirect district courts to \u201coverride\u201d waivers.  \nThe unusual procedural history of this case makes \nclear that no meaningful opportunities to satisfy the \ncorrect legal standards were available to Plaintiffs and \ntherefore the remand to the district court was not a \ndeparture from Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s long-recognized stand-\nards. Rather, in the Second Circuit parties who de-\nclined meaningful invitations \u201care not entitled to relief \nfrom the judgment.\u201d Metzler Inv. GmbH v. Chipotle \nMexican Grill, Inc., 970 F.3d 133, 148 (2d Cir. 2020).  \nThis is not unusual\u2014the circuits broadly require \ndistrict courts to provide at least one opportunity to \namend, often after dismissal when the complaint\u2019s re-\nmediable defects, if any, are correctly identified by a \ncourt ruling. Refusing leave to amend after dismissal \nis thus often an abuse of discretion\u2014the result is no \ndifferent here, except that Plaintiffs were compelled to \nappeal the district court\u2019s erroneous decision first. \nSTATEMENT \nI. \nThe Complaint and Pre-Motion Conference \nfor BLOM\u2019s Motion to Dismiss \nPlaintiffs filed their complaint on January 1, 2019, \nasserting claims under the Anti-Terrorism Act \n(\u201cATA\u201d), as amended by the Justice Against Sponsors \nof Terrorism Act (\u201cJASTA\u201d), and alleging that BLOM \naided and abetted a series of terrorist attacks commit-\nted by the Palestinian foreign terrorist organization \n(\u201cFTO\u201d) Hamas (or \u201cHAMAS\u201d) that injured Plaintiffs. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n5 \n \nSpecifically, Plaintiffs alleged that BLOM knowingly \nprovided substantial assistance to three Hamas fund-\nraisers (the \u201cThree Customers\u201d), including the pur-\nported charitable institution Sanabil, which the \nUnited States designated a Specially Designated \nGlobal Terrorist (\u201cSDGT\u201d) in 2003. Relying in part on \nfinancial records disclosed during the criminal trial of \nthe Holy Land Foundation (\u201cHLF,\u201d a notorious Hamas \nfundraiser) in Texas, Plaintiffs alleged that BLOM as-\nsisted the Three Customers in converting millions of \ndollars of donations from HLF and other Hamas sup-\nporters abroad into cash (notwithstanding BLOM\u2019s de-\nscription of its services as \u201croutine,\u201d Pet.Br.5-6), which \nthey used, inter alia, to recruit Palestinians living in \nLebanon to join and support Hamas before and during \nthe \u201cSecond Intifada,\u201d when the acts of terrorism at is-\nsue here occurred.  \nPlaintiffs alleged BLOM\u2019s knowledge by \u201crefer-\nences to media articles and publications on the Three \nCustomers\u2019 connection to Hamas.\u201d Pet.App.49. Plain-\ntiffs also alleged that Sanabil\u2019s board included contem-\nporaneous Hamas leaders in Lebanon. JA.105, 114. \nPlaintiffs alleged that Israel designated another one of \nthe Three Customers, the Union of Good, as \u201cpart of \nthe Hamas organization\u201d in 2002, during the relevant \nperiod (1998-2004, JA.82). JA.118. The Union of \nGood\u2019s infamous leader, Sheikh Qaradawi, regularly \nappeared on television during that period extolling the \nvirtues of suicide bombings against Israel. JA.120.  \nPlaintiffs also alleged that BLOM converted mil-\nlions of dollars for the Three Customers from not only \nHLF, but also from its successor KindHearts after the \nUnited States designated HLF an SDGT in 2001, \nJA.99-100, 106-13, 117, and from Al Aqsa Foundation \nafter Israel designated it a Hamas entity and its \n\n \n \n \n \n \n6 \n \nheadquarters were shuttered by the German govern-\nment\u2014and one transaction after the United States \ndesignated it an SDGT. JA.95-96, 113.  \nOn May 3, 2019, BLOM filed a letter requesting a \npre-motion conference to initiate a motion to dismiss \nthe complaint for failure to state a claim, setting forth \na summary of its anticipated arguments. JA.142-47. \nThese arguments, which the district court later \nadopted in dismissing the complaint, were incon-\nsistent with JASTA\u2019s plain language, the interpreta-\ntive guidance in Halberstam v. Welch, 705 F.2d 472 \n(D.C. Cir. 1983)\u2014which Congress set as the legal \nframework for JASTA\u2014and the Second Circuit\u2019s then-\nonly prior JASTA ruling in Linde v. Arab Bank, PLC, \n882 F.3d 314 (2d Cir. 2018).  \nPlaintiffs provided a summary of their anticipated \nopposition in a letter on May 8, 2019. JA.148-55. Spe-\ncifically, Plaintiffs relied on the standards from both \nLinde and Halberstam and noted that foreseeability \nwas the key factor in assessing a defendant\u2019s wrongful \nconduct under JASTA. As shown below, the district \ncourt ultimately adopted BLOM\u2019s arguments and re-\njected foreseeability. See Pet.App.71-72. The Second \nCircuit subsequently vindicated Plaintiffs\u2019 analysis, as \ndid this Court four years later. See Twitter, Inc. v. \nTaamneh, 598 U.S. 471, 496 (2023).  \nThe district court held a pre-motion conference on \nMay 15, 2019. After raising sua sponte whether BLOM \nhad an affirmative defense based on the statute of lim-\nitations, Pet.App.91, the court then stated:  \nI am just wondering if it might be prudent to \nallow the plaintiffs to amend their complaint, \nnot to add more claims, not to add more parties, \nbut rather to factually support some of the \n\n \n \n \n \n \n7 \n \nclaims that [defense counsel] have identified as \nbeing deficient regarding the standards that \nwere adopted by [Linde] from [Halberstam]. \n[Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel], do you want that oppor-\ntunity?  \nPet.App.93. Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel responded, \u201cNo, I think \nwe are prepared to brief it based on the arguments pre-\nsented in [our] pre-motion letter.\u201d Id. This position was \nappropriate given that Plaintiffs\u2019 readings of Linde \nand Halberstam were substantively correct, whereas \nBLOM\u2019s contrary positions were not. \nFollowing the pre-motion conference, the district \ncourt issued a Minute Entry and Scheduling Order \nnoting: \u201cThe Court offered Plaintiffs an opportunity to \namend their complaint to add additional information \nin response to the arguments raised by Defendant. \nPlaintiffs declined . . . to amend their Complaint in \nthis regard.\u201d JA.156 (emphasis added). That is, the \ndistrict court offered Plaintiffs the opportunity to meet \nBLOM\u2019s urged legal standards, which they reasonably \ndeclined\u2014as shown by the circuit\u2019s later \u201cclarification\u201d \nof the applicable standards. \nII. \nThe Motion to Dis\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n20: 20250108172209078_No.2023-125920Osen20LLC20COS.json (score: 0.390)\nE-Mail Address: 1115 H Street, NE.\nfae Driefs@wilsonepes.com Washington, D.C. 20002\n\nWeb Site: \u2018Tal (202) 789.0096\nwo \u2018wor wilsonepes.com Fax (202) 842-4896\nNo. 28-1259\nBLOM BANK SAL\nPetitioner,\n\nMICHAL HONICKMAN, ET AL.\nRespondents.\n\nAFFIDAVIT OF SERVICE\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that on January 8, 2025, three (9) copies of the BRIEF FOR\nRESPONDENTS in the abovecaptioned case were served, as required by US.

Circuit courts generally hold that \nmeans providing an opportunity to amend once a ruling \nidentifies remediable defects, if any, in a pleading. Fail-\ning to provide that opportunity may constitute an \u201cex-\ntraordinary circumstance\u201d and a basis to vacate a judg-\nment under Rule 60(b)(6).  \nHere, the Second Circuit found that the district \ncourt dismissed Respondents\u2019 complaint by applying \nthe \u201cwrong legal standard\u201d for pleading an aiding and \nabetting claim (in the Second Circuit) under the Justice \nAgainst Sponsors of Terrorism Act, as well as a stand-\nard for pleading knowledge that was \u201ctoo exacting\u201d and \nall but impossible to meet by amendment. The circuit \ncourt provided clarified pleading standards and identi-\nfied specific, remediable defects in the complaint. Re-\nspondents then promptly moved to vacate the district \ncourt\u2019s judgment in order to meet those clarified stand-\nards in an amended complaint\u2014their first in this litiga-\ntion. The district court refused and, after Respondents \nappealed again, the circuit issued a non-precedential \nsummary order remanding the case for \u201crecon-\nsider[ation].\u201d \nThe question presented is thus whether the circuit \ncourt erred in directing the district court to reconsider \nits refusal to grant Respondents an opportunity to meet \nthe pleading standards the circuit corrected in the prior \nappeal. \n \n \n\nii \n \nTABLE OF CONTENTS \nPage \nQUESTION PRESENTED ............................................. i \nTABLE OF AUTHORITIES ......................................... iv \nINTRODUCTION .......................................................... 1 \nSTATEMENT ................................................................ 4 \nI. \nThe Complaint and Pre-Motion Conference for \nBLOM\u2019s Motion to Dismiss .............................. 4 \nII. \nThe Motion to Dismiss ..................................... 7 \nIII.

The dis-\ntrict court had denied vacatur because Plaintiffs de-\nclined its pre-dismissal invitations to amend their \ncomplaint\u2014but the circuit court found the district \ncourt was applying the \u201cwrong\u201d pleading standards, \nPet.App.5, which were so overly \u201cexacting\u201d that Plain-\ntiffs could not meet them before discovery, Pet.App.49.  \nPetitioner (\u201cBLOM\u201d) argues that by making this \nstraightforward remand, the Second Circuit has effec-\ntively \u201cabandon[ed] the \u2018extraordinary circumstances\u2019 \nstandard in favor of a nebulous \u2018balanc[ing]\u2019 inquiry \nthat pits Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s protection of \u2018finality\u2019 against \n\u2018Rule 15(a)\u2019s liberal amendment policies.\u2019\u201d Pet.Br.25 \n(quoting Pet.App.8). In BLOM\u2019s telling, the Second \nCircuit has \u201cjettisoned\u201d Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s guardrails, \nPet.Br.14., and motions for post-judgment amend-\nments will now be all but rubber-stamped in the cir-\ncuit. This is incorrect. \nFirst of all, this conclusion is not supported by the \nspare language of the summary order, which simply \ndirects the district court to \u201creconsider\u201d denying vaca-\ntur given Second Circuit and Supreme Court prece-\ndents. Nothing has been \u201cabandoned\u201d\u2014consistent \nwith decisions from this Court, \u201c[r]elief under Rule \n60(b)(6)\u201d in the Second Circuit \u201cis reserved for cases \nthat present \u2018extraordinary circumstances,\u2019\u201d including \nwhere a party seeks post-judgment amendment. Man-\ndala v. NTT Data, Inc., 88 F.4th 353, 361 (2d Cir. 2023) \n(citation omitted). Indeed, the standards the Second \n\n \n \n \n \n \n2 \n \nCircuit has \u201cdeveloped\u201d\u2014and reaffirmed by the sum-\nmary order below\u2014\u201cfor evaluating postjudgment mo-\ntions generally place significant emphasis on the \n\u2018value of finality and repose.\u2019\u201d Williams v. Citigroup \nInc., 659 F.3d 208, 213 (2d Cir. 2011) (citation omit-\nted). \nSecond, balancing finality and justice is not \u201cnebu-\nlous,\u201d as BLOM calls it, but rather inherent to Rule \n60(b)(6) jurisprudence: The rule\u2019s \u201cextraordinary cir-\ncumstances\u201d requirement \u201cexists in order to balance \nthe broad language of Rule 60(b)(6), which allows \ncourts to set aside judgments for \u2018any\u2019 reason justify-\ning relief, with the interest in the finality of judg-\nments.\u201d Budget Blinds, Inc. v. White, 536 F.3d 244, \n255 (3d Cir. 2008). When considering a motion to \namend a complaint, finality interests are \u201cbalance[d] \n. . . with the preference expressed in the Federal Rules \nof Civil Procedure in general, and Rule 15 in particu-\nlar, for resolving disputes on their merits.\u201d Krupski v. \nCosta Crociere S. p. A., 560 U.S. 538, 550 (2010).  \nThird, this case does involve truly \u201cextraordinary \ncircumstances\u201d because (1) the district court dismissed \nthe complaint using a set of \u201cwrong legal standards,\u201d \nincluding the nearly impossible requirement of alleg-\ning, without the opportunity for any discovery, \u201cacts or \nstatements\u201d of \u201cBLOM employees\u201d to demonstrate the \nbank\u2019s knowledge; (2) the circuit court rejected those \nstandards on appeal\u2014including the direct evidence re-\nquirement\u2014and \u201cclarified\u201d the correct ones; (3) the cir-\ncuit court found that Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations were none-\ntheless too \u201climited\u201d to meet the clarified standards, \ndrawing a newly announced distinction between \nPlaintiffs\u2019 \u201cpublicly available\u201d evidence and \u201cpublic \nsources such as media articles,\u201d Pet.App.50 & n.18; (4) \nthe circuit court identified several remediable defects \n\n \n \n \n \n \n3 \n \nin the complaint that the district court had not, such \nas clarifying that cash withdrawals are untraceable \nand alleging the degree to which Israeli terrorism des-\nignations were publicized; and (5) Plaintiffs had not \nyet amended their complaint even once. In these one-\nof-a-kind circumstances, the Rules\u2019 strong preference \nfor deciding cases on their merits entitles Plaintiffs to \nhave at least one opportunity to cure those defects. \nBLOM\u2019s argument is therefore premised on con-\nstruing the case\u2019s procedural history to suggest the \nSecond Circuit found that Plaintiffs \u201cwaived\u201d their \nright to amend post-judgment but nevertheless \u201cdi-\nrected district courts to override and rescue parties \nfrom their \u2018free, calculated, [and] deliberate choices,\u2019\u201d \nsuch as \u201cwhen the movant has consistently and con-\nsciously rejected numerous invitations and opportuni-\nties to amend.\u201d Pet.Br.28-29 (citations omitted).  \nBut the Second Circuit never accepted BLOM\u2019s \n\u201cwaiver\u201d argument. To the contrary, it recognized that \nPlaintiffs did not have a meaningful opportunity to \namend at all because \u201cthe district court applied the \nwrong legal standard for aiding-and-abetting liability \nunder JASTA,\u201d Pet.App.5, and a standard for pleading \nknowledge that was \u201ctoo exacting,\u201d Pet.App.49. In fact, \nthe district court\u2019s knowledge pleading standard was \nunmeetable\u2014as Circuit Court Judge Wesley noted in \nresponse to BLOM\u2019s insistence at oral argument that \nPlaintiffs waived opportunities to amend: \u201cWhat are \nthey supposed to do? They know they can\u2019t amend [to] \n. . . meet that.\u201d Oral Arg. at 11:52-:56, Honickman, No. \n22-1039 (2d Cir. Oct. 5, 2023), https://ww3.ca2. \nuscourts.gov/decisions/isysquery/6a33dfa3-27c7-4b0a-\n82ee-86c41553c09a/1/doc/22-1039.mp3. \nIgnoring this, BLOM further insists that \u201cthe Sec-\nond Circuit affirmed the dismissal on grounds that the \n\n \n \n \n \n \n4 \n \nDistrict Court had relied on,\u201d Pet.Br. 40\u2014but the dis-\ntrict court itself acknowledged that the decision was \naffirmed \u201con other grounds.\u201d Pet.App.10. Most im-\nportantly, BLOM\u2019s reading of the record is irrelevant \nto the question presented\u2014the summary order below \nwas not premised on any such finding and thus did not \ndirect district courts to \u201coverride\u201d waivers.  \nThe unusual procedural history of this case makes \nclear that no meaningful opportunities to satisfy the \ncorrect legal standards were available to Plaintiffs and \ntherefore the remand to the district court was not a \ndeparture from Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s long-recognized stand-\nards. Rather, in the Second Circuit parties who de-\nclined meaningful invitations \u201care not entitled to relief \nfrom the judgment.\u201d Metzler Inv. GmbH v. Chipotle \nMexican Grill, Inc., 970 F.3d 133, 148 (2d Cir. 2020).  \nThis is not unusual\u2014the circuits broadly require \ndistrict courts to provide at least one opportunity to \namend, often after dismissal when the complaint\u2019s re-\nmediable defects, if any, are correctly identified by a \ncourt ruling. Refusing leave to amend after dismissal \nis thus often an abuse of discretion\u2014the result is no \ndifferent here, except that Plaintiffs were compelled to \nappeal the district court\u2019s erroneous decision first. \nSTATEMENT \nI. \nThe Complaint and Pre-Motion Conference \nfor BLOM\u2019s Motion to Dismiss \nPlaintiffs filed their complaint on January 1, 2019, \nasserting claims under the Anti-Terrorism Act \n(\u201cATA\u201d), as amended by the Justice Against Sponsors \nof Terrorism Act (\u201cJASTA\u201d), and alleging that BLOM \naided and abetted a series of terrorist attacks commit-\nted by the Palestinian foreign terrorist organization \n(\u201cFTO\u201d) Hamas (or \u201cHAMAS\u201d) that injured Plaintiffs. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n5 \n \nSpecifically, Plaintiffs alleged that BLOM knowingly \nprovided substantial assistance to three Hamas fund-\nraisers (the \u201cThree Customers\u201d), including the pur-\nported charitable institution Sanabil, which the \nUnited States designated a Specially Designated \nGlobal Terrorist (\u201cSDGT\u201d) in 2003. Relying in part on \nfinancial records disclosed during the criminal trial of \nthe Holy Land Foundation (\u201cHLF,\u201d a notorious Hamas \nfundraiser) in Texas, Plaintiffs alleged that BLOM as-\nsisted the Three Customers in converting millions of \ndollars of donations from HLF and other Hamas sup-\nporters abroad into cash (notwithstanding BLOM\u2019s de-\nscription of its services as \u201croutine,\u201d Pet.Br.5-6), which \nthey used, inter alia, to recruit Palestinians living in \nLebanon to join and support Hamas before and during \nthe \u201cSecond Intifada,\u201d when the acts of terrorism at is-\nsue here occurred.  \nPlaintiffs alleged BLOM\u2019s knowledge by \u201crefer-\nences to media articles and publications on the Three \nCustomers\u2019 connection to Hamas.\u201d Pet.App.49. Plain-\ntiffs also alleged that Sanabil\u2019s board included contem-\nporaneous Hamas leaders in Lebanon. JA.105, 114. \nPlaintiffs alleged that Israel designated another one of \nthe Three Customers, the Union of Good, as \u201cpart of \nthe Hamas organization\u201d in 2002, during the relevant \nperiod (1998-2004, JA.82). JA.118. The Union of \nGood\u2019s infamous leader, Sheikh Qaradawi, regularly \nappeared on television during that period extolling the \nvirtues of suicide bombings against Israel. JA.120.  \nPlaintiffs also alleged that BLOM converted mil-\nlions of dollars for the Three Customers from not only \nHLF, but also from its successor KindHearts after the \nUnited States designated HLF an SDGT in 2001, \nJA.99-100, 106-13, 117, and from Al Aqsa Foundation \nafter Israel designated it a Hamas entity and its \n\n \n \n \n \n \n6 \n \nheadquarters were shuttered by the German govern-\nment\u2014and one transaction after the United States \ndesignated it an SDGT. JA.95-96, 113.  \nOn May 3, 2019, BLOM filed a letter requesting a \npre-motion conference to initiate a motion to dismiss \nthe complaint for failure to state a claim, setting forth \na summary of its anticipated arguments. JA.142-47. \nThese arguments, which the district court later \nadopted in dismissing the complaint, were incon-\nsistent with JASTA\u2019s plain language, the interpreta-\ntive guidance in Halberstam v. Welch, 705 F.2d 472 \n(D.C. Cir. 1983)\u2014which Congress set as the legal \nframework for JASTA\u2014and the Second Circuit\u2019s then-\nonly prior JASTA ruling in Linde v. Arab Bank, PLC, \n882 F.3d 314 (2d Cir. 2018).  \nPlaintiffs provided a summary of their anticipated \nopposition in a letter on May 8, 2019. JA.148-55. Spe-\ncifically, Plaintiffs relied on the standards from both \nLinde and Halberstam and noted that foreseeability \nwas the key factor in assessing a defendant\u2019s wrongful \nconduct under JASTA. As shown below, the district \ncourt ultimately adopted BLOM\u2019s arguments and re-\njected foreseeability. See Pet.App.71-72. The Second \nCircuit subsequently vindicated Plaintiffs\u2019 analysis, as \ndid this Court four years later. See Twitter, Inc. v. \nTaamneh, 598 U.S. 471, 496 (2023).  \nThe district court held a pre-motion conference on \nMay 15, 2019. After raising sua sponte whether BLOM \nhad an affirmative defense based on the statute of lim-\nitations, Pet.App.91, the court then stated:  \nI am just wondering if it might be prudent to \nallow the plaintiffs to amend their complaint, \nnot to add more claims, not to add more parties, \nbut rather to factually support some of the \n\n \n \n \n \n \n7 \n \nclaims that [defense counsel] have identified as \nbeing deficient regarding the standards that \nwere adopted by [Linde] from [Halberstam]. \n[Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel], do you want that oppor-\ntunity?  \nPet.App.93. Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel responded, \u201cNo, I think \nwe are prepared to brief it based on the arguments pre-\nsented in [our] pre-motion letter.\u201d Id. This position was \nappropriate given that Plaintiffs\u2019 readings of Linde \nand Halberstam were substantively correct, whereas \nBLOM\u2019s contrary positions were not. \nFollowing the pre-motion conference, the district \ncourt issued a Minute Entry and Scheduling Order \nnoting: \u201cThe Court offered Plaintiffs an opportunity to \namend their complaint to add additional information \nin response to the arguments raised by Defendant. \nPlaintiffs declined . . . to amend their Complaint in \nthis regard.\u201d JA.156 (emphasis added). That is, the \ndistrict court offered Plaintiffs the opportunity to meet \nBLOM\u2019s urged legal standards, which they reasonably \ndeclined\u2014as shown by the circuit\u2019s later \u201cclarification\u201d \nof the applicable standards. \nII. \nThe Motion to Dismiss \nThe parties then briefed the motion to dismiss, in \nwhich they presented arguments largely consistent \nwith the summaries set forth in their pre-motion let-\nters.  \nDuring oral argument on the motion to dismiss, \nBLOM\u2019s counsel relied heavily on a district court deci-\nsion, Kaplan v. Lebanese Canadian Bank, SAL, 405 F. \nSupp. 3d 525 (S.D.N.Y. 2019) (\u201cKaplan I\u201d), vac\u2019d in rel-\nevant part, 999 F.3d 842 (2d Cir. 2021) (\u201cKaplan II\u201d). \nKaplan I dismissed JASTA claims against Lebanese \nCanadian Bank (\u201cLCB\u201d), premised on allegations that \n\n \n \n \n \n \n8 \n \nLCB provided financial services for the terrorist group \nHezbollah. As BLOM pointed out, BLOM allegedly \nprovided financial services for Hamas fundraisers in \nLebanon much as LCB did for entities controlled by \nHezbollah. Pet.App.131. \nBLOM urged the district court to adopt Kaplan I\u2019s \nerroneous pleading standards\u2014including its unwork-\nable standard for pleading scienter. Under that stand-\nard, the Kaplan I district court held that public state-\nments and media reports tying five of LCB\u2019s customers \nto Hezbollah could not support an inference of LCB\u2019s \nknowledge of those ties because \u201cPlaintiffs nowhere al-\nlege . . . that Defendant read or was aware of such \nsources.\u201d 405 F. Supp. 3d at 535. Naturally, before dis-\ncovery, a plaintiff will rarely be able to find support for \nwhat sources a defendant has actually \u201cread\u201d or was \naware of. See Pet.App.50 n.18 (\u201cpublic sources\u201d can \n\u201cplausibly suggest a defendant\u2019s knowledge which can \nbe confirmed during discovery\u201d) (emphasis added).  \nNonetheless, BLOM\u2019s counsel argued: \nFinally, I wanted to point out that the level of \nknowledge that Judge Daniels rejected in \nKaplan [I] was very much what\u2019s claimed here, \nwhere it said that it was notorious that there \nwere links between the accounts at issue there, \nbetween those persons and in that case, Hezbol-\nlah. And that\u2019s exactly what\u2019s said here. It was \napparently notorious that BLOM should have \nknown that these accounts were linked to HA-\nMAS, but there\u2019s no direct allegation of why \nBLOM should have known that.  \nPet.App.131. Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel disagreed, arguing \n\u201cKaplan [I] requires a level of proof that is out of step \n\n \n \n \n \n \n9 \n \nwith JASTA, out of step with Linde and would be im-\npossible to meet.\u201d Pet.App.126.  \nDuring the oral argument, the district court again \nasked: \u201cThere are no facts that you would have to offer \nto address some of the contentions of the defendants \nregarding knowledge, especially?\u201d Pet.App.125 (em-\nphasis added). But these \u201ccontentions\u201d premised on \nKaplan I were impossible to meet on amendment\u2014\nPlaintiffs possessed no evidence that any BLOM em-\nployee \u201cread or was aware of\u201d any specific piece of in-\nformation. Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel explained that while \nthey \u201ccould always add allegations, . . . the complaint \ngoes far enough in saying that BLOM holding accounts \nfor Specially Designated Global Terrorists designated \nfor . . . financing HAMAS, was generally aware of its \nrole in that [il]licit conduct, and . . . the violence that \nresulted from it was foreseeable\u201d as set forth in Linde. \nId. \nIII. \nThe District Court\u2019s Decision on the Motion \nto Dismiss and First Appeal \nThe district court granted BLOM\u2019s motion to dis-\nmiss on January 14, 2020 (\u201cHonickman I\u201d), largely on \nthe grounds BLOM raised, including\u2014as BLOM \nurged\u2014by relying heavily on Kaplan I. The district \ncourt called Kaplan I \u201ca more appropriate comparison\u201d \nand \u201ca more appropriate point of reference\u201d than other \nJASTA and ATA cases to which Plaintiffs analogized \ntheir complaint. Pet.App.77, 84.  \nFor example, and of particular importance to the \nquestion presented here, the district court adopted \nKaplan I\u2019s \u201cread-or-was-aware-of\u201d standard for plead-\ning knowledge. The district court explained that in \nKaplan I, \n\n \n \n \n \n \n10 \n \nalthough the plaintiffs argued that the entities\u2019 \nconnections to Hizbollah \u201cwas [sic] openly, pub-\nlicly and repeatedly acknowledged and publi-\ncized by Hizbollah [through its own sources]\u201d \nand \u201cin various English-language publications,\u201d \nthe plaintiffs \u201cnowhere allege[d] . . . that [LCB] \nread or was aware of such sources.\u201d The same \nanalysis applies even more strongly here, given \nthe relatively greater strength of the allegations \nin Kaplan [I]. \nPet.App.79 (quoting Kaplan I, 405 F. Supp. 3d at 535) \n(emphasis added). Having adopted this position, the \ndistrict court then faulted Plaintiffs\u2019 complaint for \nlacking allegations citing \u201cacts or statements by \nBLOM or BLOM\u2019s employees\u201d regarding its customers\u2019 \naffiliations with Hamas, instead relying on \u201cpress ar-\nticles, government actions, and allegedly \u2018public \nknowledge\u2019 discussing\u201d such connections. Pet.App.73-\n74.  \nUnsurprisingly, financial institutions do not often \npublicly admit their knowledge of their roles in assist-\ning terrorism. Therefore, moving to amend after dis-\nmissal in this case\u2014or accepting the district court\u2019s in-\nvitations to amend, such as during oral argument \nwhere BLOM demanded \u201cdirect allegation[s]\u201d of its \nknowledge, Pet.App.131\u2014would have been pointless. \nAnd while the Second Circuit also ultimately found \nPlaintiffs\u2019 allegations of BLOM\u2019s knowledge of the \nThree Customers\u2019 Hamas affiliations insufficient, it \ndid so for reasons that could be remedied by replead-\ning\u2014such as by pleading more allegations of (1) \u201cpub-\nlic sources\u201d demonstrating that Israeli terrorism des-\nignations were made public, (2) banks\u2019 policies for \nmonitoring counterparties, and (3) the untraceable na-\nture of cash. None of those grounds required alleging \n\n \n \n \n \n \n11 \n \nBLOM\u2019s internal communications or deliberations at \nthe pleading stage showing that BLOM \u201cread or was \naware\u201d of such sources.  \nPlaintiffs timely appealed the district court\u2019s dis-\nmissal decision. Because Kaplan I was also on appeal, \nthe Second Circuit held Honickman in abeyance and \ndirected the parties to submit supplemental briefs on \nthe \u201cissue of how [Kaplan] applies to this case,\u201d once \ndecided. JA.257-258. The circuit subsequently issued \nKaplan II, vacating Kaplan I\u2019s dismissal of JASTA aid-\ning and abetting claims against LCB. See 999 F.3d \n842. Kaplan II largely clarified the standards for \nJASTA liability, as Plaintiffs explained in their sup-\nplemental brief. JA.259-281. BLOM, however, argued \nthat Kaplan II somehow \u201cunderscore[d] the soundness \nof the District Court\u2019s legal analysis,\u201d despite vacating \nits primary support\u2014Kaplan I. JA.294. The circuit \nthen issued its first decision in Honickman on July 29, \n2021 (\u201cHonickman II\u201d). \nIV. \nThe Second Circuit\u2019s Assessment of the Dis-\ntrict Court\u2019s Dismissal Decision  \nThe Second Circuit \u201cagree[d]\u201d with Plaintiffs \u201cthat \nthe [district] court did not apply the proper standard \n. . . .\u201d Pet.App.24. Specifically, the circuit rejected \nevery standard the district court applied as grounds \nfor dismissal, including the direct-evidence standard \nfor alleging BLOM\u2019s knowledge of the Three Custom-\ners\u2019 affiliations with Hamas. It also rejected the dis-\ntrict court\u2019s standards for alleging the general aware-\nness and substantial assistance elements, which to-\ngether \u201cform the crux of most JASTA aiding-and-abet-\nting cases.\u201d Pet.App.37. These holdings are detailed \nbelow. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n12 \n \nBLOM \nlargely \nignores \nthese \nholdings. \nSee \nPet.Br.40. But the district court was more forthcom-\ning\u2014it acknowledged that the circuit court only af-\nfirmed on \u201cother grounds.\u201d Pet.App.10. BLOM also \ntries to rehabilitate the district court\u2019s dismissal order \nby suggesting it conforms to this Court\u2019s analysis in \nTaamneh. See Pet.Br.6-7, 8 n.2. But, of course, \nTaamneh affirmed the foreseeability standard from \nHalberstam\u2014the Honickman district court, \u201chowever, \nrejected the foreseeability principle.\u201d Pet.App.39.  \nMoreover, Taamneh had not been issued when \nPlaintiffs sought post-judgment amendment to meet \nthe Second Circuit\u2019s \u201cclarifications\u201d in Kaplan II and \nHonickman II. The issue in this case is the standard \nfor post-judgment amendment where a district court \nhas misapplied controlling law\u2014that is, the law of the \ncircuit. And even if Taamneh had completely repudi-\nated the Second Circuit\u2019s interpretation of JASTA, \nthat would only have provided a further reason to af-\nford Plaintiffs an opportunity to meet this Court\u2019s \nnewly-articulated standard. \nA. The District Court Applied the Wrong \nStandard for Pleading Knowledge \nThe most decisive problem with the district court\u2019s \ndismissal decision was its articulated standard for \npleading knowledge, which required Plaintiffs to al-\nlege \u201cacts or statements by BLOM or BLOM\u2019s employ-\nees\u201d showing their knowledge. Pet.App.73. The Second \nCircuit explained why this standard was incorrect:  \nIn assessing this element, the district court \nfound that the complaint\u2019s references to media \narticles and publications on the Three Custom-\ners\u2019 connection to Hamas were insufficient be-\ncause \u201cPlaintiffs fail[ed] plausibly to allege that \n\n \n \n \n \n \n13 \n \nBLOM [Bank] . . . actually knew or should have \nknown of any of the cited sources.\u201d However, as \nwe explained in Kaplan [II], Plaintiffs did not \nneed to allege that BLOM Bank knew or should \nhave known of the public sources at the plead-\ning stage. Such a requirement at this juncture \nwould be too exacting. \nPet.App.49 (citations omitted). \nThe district court had adopted its erroneous stand-\nard from Kaplan I, before it was vacated in relevant \npart. In Kaplan II, the circuit explained that \u201c[a] com-\nplaint is allowed to contain general allegations as to a \ndefendant\u2019s knowledge because \u2018a plaintiff realistically \ncannot be expected to plead a defendant\u2019s actual state \nof mind,\u2019\u201d although plaintiffs must \u201cinclude allegations \nof the facts or events they claim give rise to an infer-\nence of knowledge.\u201d 999 F.3d at 864 (citations omit-\nted). Moreover, the district court must \u201cconsider all of \nthe complaint\u2019s allegations, rather than considering \neach in isolation, and to accept as true all permissible \ninferences that could be drawn from the complaint as \na whole.\u201d Id. at 865.1  \nThis correction is critical. While Plaintiffs\u2019 pro-\nposed amended complaint submitted in support of \n \n1  \nThe Honickman district court also echoed Kaplan I in \npointing out that with one exception cited in the complaint, the \nU.S. did not designate the Three Customers or their counterpar-\nties as SDGTs until after the transfers at issue (although Israel \nhad designated several of the counterparties as terrorist organi-\nzations years before). See Pet.App.74-75. The circuit rejected this \nstandard in Kaplan II as well, writing: \u201cThe [Kaplan I] court cited \nno authority for such a prerequisite for knowledge, and we know \nof none; and it would defy common sense to hold that such \nknowledge could be gained in no other way.\u201d 999 F.3d at 864. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n14 \n \ntheir vacatur motion contained numerous additional \n\u201cpublic source\u201d allegations (including publications in \nEnglish, French and Arabic) to further support the \n\u201cpermissible inferences\u201d of BLOM\u2019s contemporaneous \nknowledge that it was providing substantial assis-\ntance to Hamas, JA.315-508, those allegations would \nnot satisfy Kaplan I\u2019s \u201cread or was aware of\u201d require-\nment adopted by the district court below. \nB. The District Court Applied the Wrong \nJASTA Standards \nThe Second Circuit also explained that the district \ncourt applied the wrong standards for assessing the \nJASTA elements.  \nAs to general awareness, the Second Circuit first \nset forth the standard given in Halberstam and \nacknowledged in Linde: \u201c[t]he defendant need not be \ngenerally aware of its role in the specific act that \ncaused the plaintiff\u2019s injury; instead, it must be gener-\nally aware of its role in an overall illegal activity from \nwhich the act that caused the plaintiff\u2019s injury was \nforeseeable.\u201d Pet.App.37 (citing Halberstam, 705 F.2d \nat 477, 488). It then explained that the district court \ndid not apply this standard:  \nThe district court, however, rejected the foresee-\nability principle, holding that \u201cit is not enough \nfor Plaintiffs to plausibl[y] allege that BLOM \n[Bank] was generally aware of [its] role in ter-\nrorist activities, from which terrorist attacks \nwere a natural and foreseeable consequence.\u201d \nThe court\u2019s conclusion contravenes both Hal-\nberstam and Linde[], one of the first cases in \nwhich we interpreted aiding-and-abetting lia-\nbility under JASTA. \nPet.App.39 (quoting Pet.App.71-72).  \n\n \n \n \n \n \n15 \n \nIn Taamneh, this Court likewise confirmed that:  \nAs Halberstam makes clear, people who aid and \nabet a tort can be held liable for other torts that \nwere \u201ca foreseeable risk\u201d of the intended \ntort. Accordingly, a close nexus between the as-\nsistance and the tort might help establish that \nthe defendant aided and abetted the tort, but \neven more remote support can still constitute \naiding and abetting in the right case. \n598 U.S. at 496 (quoting Halberstam, 705 F.2d at 488). \nThe Second Circuit rejected BLOM\u2019s argument \nthat providing indirect assistance changes the stand-\nard for pleading knowledge, explaining that \u201cKaplan \n[II] did not so hold; instead, it asserted \u2018the actual \nknowledge component of the Halberstam standard re-\nquires that the defendant \u201cknow[ ]\u201d that it is providing \n\u201cassistance,\u201d . . . whether directly to the FTO or indi-\nrectly through an intermediary.\u2019\u201d Pet.App.46 n.16 \n(quoting Kaplan II, 999 F.3d at 863-64). See also \nPet.App.45 n.15 (rejecting BLOM\u2019s argument regard-\ning customer activities).  \nThe circuit\u2019s Honickman II and Kaplan II decisions \nalso rejected the district court\u2019s assertion that \u201cthe \nmere provision of routine banking services to an FTO \ndoes not render a bank liable for civil aiding and abet-\nting.\u201d Pet.App.71. The Kaplan II court explained that \nso-called \u201croutine\u201d services could suffice depending on \nthe circumstances, and that, under Linde, \u201cwhether a \ndefendant bank\u2019s \u2018financial services to [an FTO or its \naffiliates should or] should not be viewed as routine\u2019 is \na \u2018question[] of fact for a jury to decide.\u2019\u201d 999 F.3d at \n858 (quoting Linde, 882 F.3d at 327) (alterations orig-\ninal to Kaplan II). See also Taamneh, 598 U.S. at 502 \n(noting circumstances \u201cwhere the provider of routine \n\n \n \n \n \n \n16 \n \nservices\u201d could be liable for \u201caiding and abetting a fore-\nseeable terror attack\u201d). \nThe Second Circuit also found that the district \ncourt applied incorrect standards to plead the knowing \nand substantial assistance element. This included \nmisapprehending the \u201cknowing\u201d prong under circuit \nlaw2 and misapplying each of the Halberstam substan-\ntial assistance factors it analyzed. Pet.App.45.  \nThe district court \u201cmisunderstood the first factor, \n\u2018the nature of the act encouraged,\u2019 to be a question of \nwhether Plaintiffs plausibly alleged \u2018that BLOM \n[Bank] knowingly encouraged Hamas\u2019[s] violent activ-\nities, such as those which caused Plaintiffs\u2019 injuries.\u2019\u201d \nPet.App.46. Indeed, the Halberstam defendant did not \n\u201cencourage\u201d her burglar boyfriend to commit the un-\nplanned murder of Dr. Halberstam, of which she had \nno knowledge.  \nThe district court also applied too exacting a stand-\nard for \u201cthe second factor, \u2018the amount of assistance,\u2019\u201d \nrequiring allegations of how the money BLOM moved \nfor Hamas actually made it through the FTO\u2019s fronts. \nTo the contrary, \u201c[f]actual allegations that permit a \nreasonable inference that the defendant recognized \nthe money it transferred to its customers would be re-\nceived by the FTO would suffice.\u201d Pet.App.47. \n \n2  \nThe Second Circuit did not, as some JASTA defendants \nhave suggested, \u201canalyze[] the \u2018knowing\u2019 subelement as a carbon \ncopy of the antecedent element of whether the defendants were \n\u2018generally aware\u2019 of their role in ISIS\u2019 overall scheme.\u201d Taamneh, \n598 U.S. at 503 (citations omitted). It only observed that the same \nfacts could satisfy both mental state elements: \u201cFor instance, Hal-\nberstam . . . . did not require [the defendant] to \u2018know\u2019 anything \nmore about [the murderer\u2019s] unlawful activities than what she \nknew for the general awareness element.\u201d Pet.App.46.  \n\n \n \n \n \n \n17 \n \nFinally, under the fourth factor, the defendant\u2019s re-\nlation to the principal, \u201c[t]he district court erroneously \nconstrued\u201d Second Circuit precedent \u201cto mean that \nPlaintiffs must plead a direct relationship between \nBLOM Bank and Hamas.\u201d Pet.App.47-48. A less direct \nrelationship, depending on the circumstances, could \nsuffice. \nAgain, these errors align with BLOM\u2019s \u201cargu-\nments\u201d and \u201ccontentions\u201d to which the district court \ninvited Plaintiffs to respond by amendment. JA.156, \nPet.App.125. Plaintiffs reasonably declined these invi-\ntations, as evidenced by the Second Circuit\u2019s complete \nrejection of them. \nC. The Second Circuit Affirmed the District \nCourt Decision Only on Another Ground \nThe Second Circuit affirmed the dismissal decision \nentirely on one ground: \u201cWe conclude that Plaintiffs\u2019 \naiding-and-abetting claim fails because the allegations \ndo not support an inference that BLOM Bank was \naware of the Three Customers\u2019 ties with Hamas prior \nto the relevant attacks, thereby undermining the sec-\nond element of general awareness.\u201d Pet.App.49. But \nwhereas the district court required allegations of \u201cacts \nor statements\u201d from \u201cBLOM employees\u201d demonstrat-\ning their actual knowledge (which Plaintiffs naturally \ndid not have before discovery), the Second Circuit \nidentified a less exacting set of specific and remediable \ndeficiencies in the complaint\u2019s knowledge allegations. \nChief among these was the circuit\u2019s finding that \nPlaintiffs\u2019 evidence of the Three Customers\u2019 Hamas af-\nfiliations was \u201cpublicly available,\u201d rather than from \n\u201cpublic sources\u201d: \nHowever, \u201cpublicly available\u201d evidence is not \nthe same as public sources such as media \n\n \n \n \n \n \n18 \n \narticles. The latter, depending on their sub-\nstance, \nplausibly \nsuggest \na \ndefendant\u2019s \nknowledge which can be confirmed during dis-\ncovery, whereas the former requires the implau-\nsible inference that the defendant was aware of \nthose facts even before the news media. \nPet.App.50 n.18. The court then went on to find Plain-\ntiffs\u2019 allegations of \u201cpublic sources\u201d too \u201climited\u201d in de-\ntail and numerosity. Pet.App.51. \nPlaintiffs understandably did not anticipate this \nnew evidentiary distinction (the district court cer-\ntainly did not). Moreover, the Second Circuit did not \ncite any precedent for this position, and it is by all ap-\npearances a newly articulated distinction. Nor did the \nKaplan II decision mention any distinction between \n\u201cpublicly available evidence\u201d and \u201cpublic sources\u201d of \nevidence. In fact, \u201cpublicly available evidence\u201d echoes \nthe term the Second Circuit had previously used as a \nbasis for inferring knowledge, relying on this Court\u2019s \nprecedent: \u201cPublicly available information may pro-\nvide relevant circumstantial evidence of actual \nknowledge.\u201d Fed. Hous. Fin. Agency v. Nomura Hold-\ning Am., Inc., 873 F.3d 85, 122 (2d Cir. 2017) (empha-\nsis added) (citing Desert Palace, Inc. v. Costa, 539 U.S. \n90, 100 (2003)). Indeed, it seems reasonable that \nbanks, given their unique Know-Your-Customer obli-\ngations and due diligence policies, which assume close \nmonitoring of customer accounts and transactions, \nwould know facts about their customers \u201cbefore the \nnews media\u201d report it (which involves deciding what is \nnewsworthy and what facts are verifiable).  \nBut no matter\u2014Plaintiffs\u2019 proposed amended com-\nplaint included numerous and detailed allegations of \ncontemporaneous \u201cpublic sources\u201d to meet the Second \nCircuit\u2019s requirement.  \n\n \n \n \n \n \n19 \n \nThe other defects the circuit identified were also re-\nmediable. For example, the circuit discounted Plain-\ntiffs\u2019 assertion that BLOM must have noticed that the \nThree Customers were receiving funds from desig-\nnated terrorist entities. The circuit noted that the com-\nplaint alleged that Sanabil received transfers from the \n\u201cAl-Aqsa Foundation\u201d after Israel designated it as a \nterrorist organization, but not \u201cwhether and where \nthis [designation] was made public.\u201d Pet.App.52 n.20. \nThe circuit also noted that the complaint needed \u201cfur-\nther allegations\u201d to show that a defendant-bank would \nknow about \u201ctransfers of funds from non-customers as-\nsociated with an FTO to the defendant\u2019s customers.\u201d \nId.  \nThese defects were not due to unreasonable draft-\ning\u2014previous ATA decisions found it reasonable to in-\nfer that a foreign bank would \u201cmonitor publicly avail-\nable information,\u201d including \u201cIsraeli lists of terrorists.\u201d \nWeiss v. Nat\u2019l Westminster Bank PLC, 453 F. Supp. \n2d 609, 627 (E.D.N.Y. 2006) (emphasis added). But the \nproposed amended complaint now includes media re-\nports on the relevant Israeli designations and BLOM\u2019s \nown customer due diligence procedures, such as moni-\ntoring transfer counterparties and non-profit organi-\nzations, which are often used as terror fronts.  \nSimilarly, although Plaintiffs repeatedly empha-\nsized the suspicious nature of Sanabil making large \ncash withdrawals from its BLOM account, the circuit \nsuggesting that the complaint should more explicitly \nallege that cash is \u201cuntraceable.\u201d Pet.App.51 n.19. Alt-\nhough Plaintiffs took that characteristic of cash to be \na reasonable inference rather than a necessary allega-\ntion, they included those explicit allegations in the \nproposed amended complaint. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n20 \n \nV. \nPlaintiffs\u2019 Motion to Vacate and Amend and \nthe Second Appeal \nAs the Second Circuit explained in the summary \norder below, the district court had applied the \u201cwrong \nlegal standards\u201d in dismissing the complaint, so once \n\u201c[a]rmed with this Court\u2019s clarifications, Plaintiffs re-\nturned to the district court,\u201d promptly moving (11 days \nafter Honickman II issued\u2014in fact, before the man-\ndate issued) under Rules 60(b)(6) and 15(a)(2) to va-\ncate the judgment of dismissal and grant them leave \nto file a first amended complaint. JA.315. The district \ncourt denied the motion, concluding that Plaintiffs \nfailed to show extraordinary circumstances chiefly be-\ncause they declined the district court\u2019s two prior invi-\ntations to meet the erroneous and largely impossible \npleading standard BLOM urged and that the district \ncourt erroneously adopted.  \nPlaintiffs again appealed. During argument, Cir-\ncuit Court Judge Wesley\u2014who also authored Honick-\nman II\u2014noted the case constituted an \u201cunusual cir-\ncumstance,\u201d 10/5/2023 Oral Arg. at 3:40, and \u201ca curi-\nous situation,\u201d id. at 10:54, and was \u201cquirky,\u201d id. at \n18:07. And as he recognized, Plaintiffs faced \u201ca wrong \nstandard\u201d \u201cthat\u2019s even harder for them to meet.\u201d Judge \nWesley observed: \u201cWhat are they supposed to do? They \nknow they can\u2019t amend [to] . . . meet that\u201d standard. \nId. at 11:50-56. The dismissal was \u201c[a]ffirmed for a dif-\nferent reason,\u201d as a result of a series of cases \u201cwhere \nthe law was really recasting itself.\u201d Id. at 13:12-38. \nAfter that oral argument in this case, the Second \nCircuit decided Mandala, another \u201cone of the excep-\ntional cases necessitating relief from judgment.\u201d Man-\ndala, 88 F.4th at 365. In Mandala, the plaintiffs \nbrought a putative class action alleging that defendant \nNTT Data\u2019s policy of not hiring people with felony \n\n \n \n \n \n \n21 \n \nconvictions disproportionately harms Black appli-\ncants. See id. at 357. The plaintiffs cited government \nreports showing \u201cBlack people are arrested and incar-\ncerated at higher rates than others.\u201d Id. The district \ncourt dismissed the complaint because it did not show \nthat there was a similar disparity among Black appli-\ncants for NTT\u2019s positions specifically.  \nThe Second Circuit affirmed, \u201cagree[ing] with the \ndistrict court\u201d that the complaint\u2019s statistics did not \nfocus on \u201cappropriate comparator groups.\u201d Id. at 357-\n58 (citation omitted). However, the circuit recognized \n\u201cthat such granular data may be impossible to collect \nwithout discovery,\u201d and that \u201cthe Complaint might \nhave survived dismissal if it had contained allegations \nexplaining \u2018why their chosen national statistics are in \nfact likely to be representative of NTT\u2019s qualified ap-\nplicant pool.\u2019\u201d Id. at 358 (citation omitted). The plain-\ntiffs petitioned for rehearing en banc, and although it \nwas denied, the dissenting judges urged the plaintiffs \nto move for vacatur and leave to amend. The plaintiffs \ndid, and the district court denied the motion.  \nOn appeal, the second Mandala panel acknowl-\nedged that \u201c[i]t wasn\u2019t until this Court\u2019s decision on \nappeal that it became clear what other types of infor-\nmation might suffice at the pleading stage.\u201d Id. at 365. \nAs a result, the panel vacated that denial and re-\nmanded the motion for reconsideration given Foman, \nthe Second Circuit cases Metzler and Williams, and \nother precedents.  \nRecognizing that its \u201cdiscussion of the various con-\nsiderations in Mandala will be particularly helpful to \nthe district court\u2019s analysis\u201d of Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for \nvacatur and leave to amend, the Second Circuit issued \nthe summary order below, likewise citing Foman and \nMetzler. Pet.App.1-8. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n22 \n \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \n1. Second Circuit precedent does not meaningfully \ndiffer from other circuits\u2019 post-judgment amendment \nholdings. The summary order below does not \u201chold\u201d \nanything, and the precedents it cites are typical of \nRule 60(b)(6) cases. For example, they uncontrover-\nsially hold that \u201c[r]elief under Rule 60(b)(6) is reserved \nfor cases that present \u2018extraordinary circumstances.\u2019\u201d \nMandala, 88 F.4th at 361 (quoting Liljeberg v. Health \nServs. Acquisition Corp., 486 U.S. 847, 863 (1988)).  \nThis case involves highly exceptional circum-\nstances. The district court applied erroneous stand-\nards for pleading aiding and abetting under JASTA, \nincluding a knowledge pleading standard that was all \nbut impossible to meet. Pet.App.5, 49. Plaintiffs rea-\nsonably declined the district court\u2019s invitation to \namend to meet those erroneous standards. The Second \nCircuit \u201cagree[d]\u201d that those standards were incorrect, \nbut found the complaint did not meet the standards it \n\u201cclarified\u201d on appeal. Pet.App.25, 40 n.11. After the \ndistrict court refused to let Plaintiffs amend their com-\nplaint to meet the clarified standard, the Second Cir-\ncuit directed it to reconsider, given prior precedents. It \ndid not dictate a particular outcome.  \n2. The balancing test the circuit court described is \nalso typical of Rule 60(b)(6) cases. The Second Circuit \nrejects allowing the \u201cliberal amendment policy of Rule \n15(a) to swallow the philosophy favoring finality of \njudgments whole.\u201d Metzler, 970 F.3d at 146 (internal \nquotation marks and citation omitted). Rather, the \ntest balances Rule 60(b)\u2019s value of finality \u201cwith the \npreference expressed in the Federal Rules of Civil Pro-\ncedure in general, and Rule 15 in particular, for resolv-\ning disputes on their merits.\u201d Krupski, 560 U.S. at \n550. After all, \u201cthe \u2018whole purpose\u2019 of Rule 60(b) \u2018is to \n\n \n \n \n \n \n23 \n \nmake an exception to finality.\u2019\u201d Buck v. Davis, 580 U.S. \n100, 126 (2017) (citations omitted). \nThe practical effect of that balance is far more mod-\nest than BLOM suggests: \u201cIn the post-judgment con-\ntext, we have indeed given \u2018due regard\u2019 to \u2018the liberal \nspirit of Rule 15\u2019 by ensuring plaintiffs at least one op-\nportunity to replead.\u201d Metzler, 970 F.3d at 146 (quot-\ning Williams, 659 F.3d at 213-14). See also Mandala, \n88 F.4th at 362 (same). Courts regularly recognize the \nimportance of providing plaintiffs an opportunity to \namend their complaints once apprised of actual defects \nin them. Where the dismissal standards are wrong, \nhowever, \u201cthe proper recourse\u201d is an appeal, United \nStates v. Mask of Ka-Nefer-Nefer, 752 F.3d 737, 743 \n(8th Cir. 2014), which Plaintiffs here took. None of \nBLOM\u2019s cited cases suggest that under the circum-\nstances present here Plaintiffs would not be entitled to \namend. \n3. BLOM\u2019s appeal is premised on the unsupported \ninference that the Second Circuit agreed that Plain-\ntiffs \u201cwaived\u201d their opportunities to amend but then \n\u201cdirected district courts to override and rescue parties \nfrom their \u2018free, calculated, [and] deliberate choices.\u2019\u201d \nPet.Br.28-29. But the Second Circuit did not find any \nwaiver. Quite the opposite, it suggested Plaintiffs rea-\nsonably appealed the district court\u2019s dismissal deci-\nsion and never received a meaningful opportunity to \nmeet the correct and newly clarified standards\u2014and \nthus had nothing to waive.  \nBLOM\u2019s litany of \u201cwaived\u201d opportunities to amend \nare not supported by the record and in any event were \nnot accepted by the panel below in discussing post-\njudgment amendment standards. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n24 \n \n4. The Second Circuit\u2019s precedents do not conflict \nwith the text of Rule 60(b) or Rule 15(a). The Second \nCircuit requires determining which Rule 60(b) provi-\nsion applies as a \u201cthreshold issue,\u201d before considering \namendment. Mandala, 88 F.4th at 359. The desire to \namend a complaint itself is insufficient. \n5. Extraordinary circumstances are clearly present \nhere, for the reasons stated above. Plaintiffs were not \nafforded a meaningful opportunity to address actual \ndefects in their complaint. They properly appealed the \ndistrict court\u2019s erroneous decision and then promptly \nsought vacatur to meet the clarified standards the cir-\ncuit issued on appeal. Discovery has not even com-\nmenced\u2014this case is in its infancy, and Plaintiffs \nshould have the opportunity to have their case adjudi-\ncated on the merits. \nARGUMENT  \nI. \nThe Second Circuit\u2019s Analysis Is Consistent \nwith Post-Judgment Amendment Jurispru-\ndence Nationally. \nBLOM asserts that the summary order below \n\u201cabandons the \u2018extraordinary circumstances\u2019 standard \nin favor of a nebulous \u2018balanc[ing]\u2019 inquiry that pits \nRule 60(b)(6)\u2019s protection of \u2018finality\u2019 against \u2018Rule \n15(a)\u2019s liberal amendment policies.\u2019\u201d Pet.Br.25 (quot-\ning Pet.App.8). This is inaccurate.  \nFirst, as Respondent acknowledges, the decision \nbelow is a non-precedential summary order which \nmerely \u201c[r]el[ies] on a series of Second Circuit prece-\ndents.\u201d Pet.Br.20. In fact, the order only cites three de-\ncisions on post-judgment amendment\u2014Mandala and \nMetzler from the Second Circuit, and Foman v. Davis, \n371 U.S. 178 (1962), from this Court.  \n\n \n \n \n \n \n25 \n \nSecond, these decisions are not erroneous and cer-\ntainly do not \u201cjettison\u201d the extraordinary circum-\nstances standard, as BLOM claims. Pet.Br.14. Man-\ndala holds that \u201c[r]elief under Rule 60(b)(6) is reserved \nfor cases that present \u2018extraordinary circumstances.\u2019\u201d \n88 F.4th at 361 (quoting Liljeberg, 486 U.S. at 863). \nAnd in Metzler, the Second Circuit affirmed denial of \npost-judgment amendment because \u201cthe plaintiffs-ap-\npellants fail[ed] to identify any \u2018extraordinary circum-\nstances\u2019 that would \u2018justify[] relief\u2019 under Rule \n60(b)(6).\u201d 970 F.3d at 147. \nAs explained below, the \u201cextraordinary circum-\nstances\u201d here are clear. This case is, as Judge Wesley \nput it, \u201cunusual,\u201d \u201cquirky,\u201d and \u201ccurious,\u201d appearing to \ndeny Plaintiffs even a single meaningful opportunity \nto amend. The Second Circuit therefore directed the \ndistrict court to reconsider its denial of vacatur given \nthe standards in Mandala and Metzler. As this re-\nmand reflected, Rule 60(b)(6) motions inherently re-\nquire \u201ccase-by-case inquiry,\u201d Stokes v. Williams, 475 \nF.3d 732, 736 (6th Cir. 2007)). Indeed, even if this \nCourt wanted to revisit its jurisprudence on Rule \n60(b), it is difficult to imagine it being able to fashion \nany generally applicable standard based on the \u201cunu-\nsual\u201d procedural history of this case. \nA. Rule 60(b)(6) Jurisprudence Balances Fi-\nnality and the Preference for Deciding \nCases on Their Merits. \nMandala and Metzler both apply the balancing test \narticulated in Williams v. Citigroup: \u201cpostjudgment \nmotions for leave to replead must be evaluated with \ndue regard to both the value of finality and the policies \nembodied in Rule 15.\u201d 659 F.3d at 213. Finality thus \nremains the starting point for applying Rule 60(b)(6) \nin the Second Circuit: \u201c[t]he standards we have \n\n \n \n \n \n \n26 \n \ndeveloped for evaluating postjudgment motions gener-\nally place significant emphasis on the \u2018value of finality \nand repose.\u2019\u201d Id. (citation omitted). The circuit notes \nthat \u2018\u201c[t]o hold otherwise would enable the liberal \namendment policy of Rule 15(a) to be employed in a \nway that is contrary to the philosophy favoring finality \nof judgments and the expeditious termination of liti-\ngation.\u2019\u201d Id. (quoting Nat\u2019l Petrochemical Co. v. M/T \nStolt Sheaf, 930 F.2d 240, 245 (2d Cir. 1991)). \nFinality is then balanced with Rule 15(a)\u2019s prefer-\nence for resolving cases on their merits, which the Wil-\nliams panel sourced from this Court\u2019s \u201c[p]articularly \ninstructive\u201d Foman decision. 695 F.3d at 213. Foman \nheld that the district court abused its discretion in \ndenying a motion to vacate the judgment in order to \namend the complaint:  \nRule 15(a) declares that leave to amend \u201cshall \nbe freely given when justice so requires\u201d; this \nmandate is to be heeded. See generally, 3 \nMoore, Federal Practice (2d ed. 1948), paras. \n15.08, 15.10. If the underlying facts or circum-\nstances relied upon by a plaintiff may be a \nproper subject of relief, he ought to be afforded \nan opportunity to test his claim on the mer-\nits. In the absence of any apparent or declared \nreason \u2014 such as undue delay, bad faith or di-\nlatory motive on the part of the movant, re-\npeated failure to cure deficiencies by amend-\nments previously allowed, undue prejudice to \nthe opposing party by virtue of allowance of the \namendment, futility of amendment, etc. \u2014 the \nleave sought should, as the rules require, be \n\u201cfreely given.\u201d Of course, the grant or denial of \nan opportunity to amend is within the discre-\ntion of the District Court, but outright refusal to \n\n \n \n \n \n \n27 \n \ngrant the leave without any justifying reason \nappearing for the denial is not an exercise of dis-\ncretion; it is merely abuse of that discretion and \ninconsistent with the spirit of the Federal \nRules. \n371 U.S. at 182.3 See, e.g., United States v. Vorachek, \n563 F.2d 884, 887 (8th Cir. 1977) (vacatur necessary \ngiven Foman and Rule 15(a)).  \nThis Court has always balanced the finality of judg-\nments with the preference for giving plaintiffs \u201can op-\nportunity to test their claims on the merits.\u201d For ex-\nample, this Court \u201cbalance[d] the interests of the de-\nfendant protected by the statute of limitations with \nthe preference expressed in the Federal Rules of Civil \nProcedure in general, and Rule 15 in particular, for re-\nsolving disputes on their merits.\u201d Krupski, 560 U.S. at \n550. A statute of limitations embodies the value of fi-\nnality and repose, see, e.g., Lozano v. Alvarez, 572 U.S. \n1, 14 (2014), just as, in the Second Circuit, \u201cpostjudg-\nment motions generally place significant emphasis on \n \n3  \nBLOM argues that the circuit erred in relying on Foman \nbecause the vacatur motion in that case was treated as coming \nunder Rule 59(e), not Rule 60(b), and the two rules \u201cdiffer in ma-\nterial ways and impose different standards for relief by their own \nterms.\u201d Pet.Br.18, 34-35. As explained infra 31-32, any such dis-\ntinction does not help BLOM\u2014but it was also completely irrele-\nvant to this Court\u2019s analysis in Foman. The First Circuit had de-\ncided to treat the motion as \u201cfiled pursuant to Rule 59(e), rather \nthan under Rule 60(b)\u201d to resolve an unrelated procedural issue \ninvolving two notices of appeal. Foman v. Davis, 292 F.2d 85, 87 \n(1st Cir. 1961). This Court then noted that the \u201cCourt of Appeals\u2019 \ntreatment of the motion to vacate as one under Rule 59(e) was \npermissible, at least as an original matter, and we will accept \nthat characterization here.\u201d 371 U.S. at 181. It never suggested \nthat the \u201ccharacterization\u201d impacted its review or the vacatur \nstandards it applied.  \n\n \n \n \n \n \n28 \n \nthe \u2018value of finality and repose,\u2019\u201d Williams, 659 F.3d \nat 213 (internal citation omitted).  \nThis Court has also always understood Rule 60(b) \nas accommodating that preference, rejecting argu-\nments that overemphasize finality at its expense. For \nexample: \u201c[T]he State reminds us of the importance of \npreserving the finality of judgments. But the \u2018whole \npurpose\u2019 of Rule 60(b) \u2018is to make an exception to final-\nity.\u2019\u201d Buck, 580 U.S. at 126 (citations omitted). BLOM \nrelies heavily on this Court\u2019s analysis of finality in \nGonzalez v. Crosby but omits its conclusion: \u201c[W]e give \nlittle weight to respondent\u2019s appeal to the virtues of \nfinality. That policy consideration, standing alone, is \nunpersuasive in the interpretation of a provision \nwhose whole purpose is to make an exception to final-\nity.\u201d 545 U.S. 524, 529 (2005). Likewise, BLOM quotes \nthis Court\u2019s admonition in United States v. Denedo \nthat \u201cjudgment finality is not to be lightly cast aside,\u201d \nPet.Br.27, but again leaves out the Court\u2019s conclusion: \n\u201cthe finality rule is not so inflexible that it trumps each \nand every competing consideration.\u201d 556 U.S. 904, 916 \n(2009). A \u201cjudgment\u201d based on the wrong reasons, due \nlargely to what the circuit itself concedes to have been \nits own \u201cambigu[ous]\u201d precedent, Pet.App.40 n.11, is \nto be \u201ccast aside\u201d in order to permit disposition on the \nmerits.  \nLike this Court, the Second Circuit rejects \u201ca stand-\nard that overemphasize[s] considerations of finality at \nthe expense of the liberal amendment policy embodied \nin the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\u201d Williams, 659 \nF.3d at 210. And like this Court, the Second Circuit \nholds that \u201cRule 60(b) relief is designed to afford par-\nties an opportunity to resolve a dispute on its merits.\u201d \nNemaizer v. Baker, 793 F.2d 58, 63 (2d Cir. 1986) (cit-\ning 7 Moore\u2019s Federal Practice, \u00b6 60.19, at 156 (2d ed. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n29 \n \n1983)). That is, the policies underlying Rules 60(b) and \n15(a) work \u201cin tandem,\u201d as the Second Circuit ex-\nplained below. Pet.App.7. \nThe circuit courts have also consistently recognized \nthis balance inherent in Rule 60(b)(6). The rule\u2019s \u201c[ex-\ntraordinary circumstances] requirement exists in or-\nder to balance the broad language of Rule 60(b)(6), \nwhich allows courts to set aside judgments for \u2018any\u2019 \nreason justifying relief, with the interest in the finality \nof judgments.\u201d Budget Blinds, 536 F.3d at 255. The \nNinth Circuit sourced this principle to Gonzalez:  \nAs the Sixth Circuit rightly held when applying \nGonzalez, \u201cthe decision to grant Rule 60(b)(6) \nrelief is a case-by-case inquiry that requires the \ntrial court to intensively balance numerous fac-\ntors, including the competing policies of the fi-\nnality of judgments and the incessant command \nof the court\u2019s conscience that justice be done in \nlight of all the facts.\u201d  \nPhelps v. Alameida, 569 F.3d 1120, 1133 (9th Cir. \n2009) (quoting Stokes, 475 F.3d at 736). See also In re \nSpansion, Inc., 507 F. App\u2019x 125, 128 (3d Cir. 2012) \n(\u201cThe rule seeks \u2018to strike a proper balance between \nthe conflicting principles that litigation must be \nbrought to an end and that justice must be done.\u2019\u201d) (ci-\ntation omitted); Blue Diamond Coal Co. v. Trs. of the \nUMWA Combined Benefit Fund, 249 F.3d 519, 529 \n(6th Cir. 2001) (same); People for the Ethical Treat-\nment of Animals v. United States HHS, 901 F.3d 343, \n354-55 (D.C. Cir. 2018) (same); Griffin v. Swim-Tech \nCorp.,722 F.2d 677, 680 (11th Cir. 1984) (same); Grace \nv. Bank Leumi Tr. Co., 443 F.3d 180, 190 n.8 (2d Cir. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n30 \n \n2006) (same).4 See also 11 C. Wright, A. Miller & M.K. \nKane, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 2851 (2d ed. \n1995) (same). \nThe Eighth Circuit has held that district courts re-\nviewing post-judgment motions to amend under Rule \n59(e) or Rule 60(b) \u2018\u201cmay not ignore the Rule 15(a)(2) \nconsiderations that favor affording parties an oppor-\ntunity to test their claims on the merits . . . .\u2019\u201d Mask of \nKa-Nefer-Nefer, 752 F.3d at 743 (quoting United \nStates ex rel. Roop v. Hypoguard USA, Inc., 559 F.3d \n818, 823-24 (8th Cir. 2009)). Indeed, Moore\u2019s Federal \nPractice specifically notes that \u201c[t]he hybrid approach \nof the Second and Eighth Circuits strikes the correct \nbalance: it protects the strong interest in finality of \njudgments and the expeditious termination of litiga-\ntion, while allowing postjudgment amendment of \npleadings in a particular case if justice requires.\u201d 12 \nMoore\u2019s Federal Practice - Civil \u00a7 59.30. For that prop-\nosition, Moore\u2019s relies on two Rule 60(b)(6) cases\u2014Wil-\nliams and Mask of Ka-Nefer-Nefer. Id., \u00a7 59.30 n.9.1.3, \nn.9.1.4. \nThe Seventh Circuit gives even greater weight to \nRule 15 interests when the district court has entered \njudgment at the same time it dismisses a complaint: \nBecause Rules 59(e) and 60(b) are reserved for \nextraordinary cases, the Girl Scouts urge us to \napply a more demanding standard to post-judg-\nment motions to amend than we do to motions \nto amend filed prior to the entry of judgment. \n \n4  \nThe same is true for Rule 59(e), in which \u201c[t]he court must \nstrike the proper balance between two competing imperatives: (1) \nfinality, and (2) the need to render just decisions on the basis of \nall the facts.\u201d Edward H. Bohlin Co. v. Banning Co., 6 F.3d 350, \n355 (5th Cir. 1993). \n\n \n \n \n \n \n31 \n \nBut the extraordinary nature of these remedies \ndoes not mean that a different standard ap-\nplies\u2014at least when judgment was entered at \nthe same time the case was first dismissed. \nWhen the district court has taken the unusual \nstep of entering judgment at the same time it \ndismisses the complaint, the court need not find \nother extraordinary circumstances and must \nstill apply the liberal standard for amending \npleadings under Rule 15(a). \nRunnion v. Girl Scouts of Greater Chi. & Nw. Ind., 786 \nF.3d 510, 521 (7th Cir. 2015). See also NewSpin \nSports, Ltd. Liab. Co. v. Arrow Elecs., Inc., 910 F.3d \n293, 310 (7th Cir. 2018) (same). \nBLOM attempts to draw a distinction between \npost-judgment analyses under \u201cRules 59(e) and 60(b),\u201d \nrelying on Daulatzai v. Maryland, 97 F.4th 166 (4th \nCir. 2024). Pet.Br.34-35. But Daulatzai only held that \nunder Rule 59(e), a court should solely \u201capply the more \nspecific standard of Rule 15(a),\u201d and \u201cneed not concern \nitself\u201d with Rule 59(e)\u2019s other standards. 97 F.4th at \n177 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). \nSee also Rosenzweig v. Azurix Corp., 332 F.3d 854, 864 \n(5th Cir. 2003) (\u201cthis Court has held that, under these \ncircumstances, the considerations for a Rule 59(e) mo-\ntion are governed by Rule 15(a)\u201d); Jang v. Bos. Sci. \nScimed, Inc., 729 F.3d 357, 368 (3d Cir. 2013) (\u201c[w]here \na timely motion to amend judgment is filed under Rule \n59(e), the Rule 15 and 59 inquiries turn on the same \nfactors.\u201d) (internal quotation marks and citation omit-\nted); Allen v. Walmart Stores, L.L.C., 907 F.3d 170, \n184 (5th Cir. 2018) (same).5 Daulatzai unremarkably \n \n5  \nBLOM relies heavily on Banister v. Davis, 590 U.S. 504 \n(2020), but that case deals with what types of vacatur motions \ncount as a successive habeas application. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n32 \n \nheld that \u201cto obtain relief from a final judgment under \nRule 60(b), one of the six grounds enumerated must be \nsatisfied,\u201d including finding \u201cextraordinary circum-\nstances\u201d under Rule 60(b)(6). 97 F.4th at 178. The \nplaintiff failed to show \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d \nthere because she had already amended twice, and her \namendment \u201cefforts were pursued in bad faith.\u201d Id. at \n170. The extraordinary circumstances requirement is \nthe same in Metzler and Mandala (and in Runnion, \nwhich did find \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d).  \nIn sum, BLOM\u2019s claim that \u201cevery one of [the Sec-\nond Circuit\u2019s] sister Circuits\u201d disagrees with it is \nsimply wrong. Pet.Br.25. A number of BLOM\u2019s own \ncases recognize the need to balance competing policies \nin Rule 60(b). For example, in Leisure Caviar, LLC v. \nUnited States Fish & Wildlife Service, the Sixth Cir-\ncuit explained that while amendment should be \u201cfreely \nallowed,\u201d \u201cwhen a Rule 15 motion comes after a judg-\nment against the plaintiff,\u201d courts \u201cmust \u2018consider[] \nthe competing interest of protecting the finality of \njudgments\u201d; that is, \u201c[i]nstead of meeting only the \nmodest requirements of Rule 15, the claimant must \nmeet the requirements for reopening a case estab-\nlished by Rules 59 or 60.\u201d 616 F.3d 612, 615-16 (6th \nCir. 2010) (citations omitted) (emphases added). Like \nin Phelps, Leisure Caviar directs courts to balance the \n\u201ccompeting\u201d policies of Rule 15 and Rule 60.  \nAnd in Nation v. DOI, the Ninth Circuit explained \nthat \u201c[a]fter judgment . . . \u2018our policy of promoting the \nfinality of judgments\u2019 somewhat displaces Rule 15\u2019s \nopenhandedness,\u201d given Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s predicate of \nextraordinary circumstances. 876 F.3d 1144, 1173 (9th \nCir. 2017) (citation omitted) (emphasis added). That \ncase affirmed denial of post-judgment leave to amend \nbecause the plaintiff had already twice amended and \n\n \n \n \n \n \n33 \n \nfailed to identify how yet another amendment could \ncure its standing problem.  \nMost of BLOM\u2019s remaining cases simply note that \na judgment must be appealed or vacated before a com-\nplaint is amended or that Rule 15(a) does not alone \nprovide the analytical basis for vacatur\u2014but none dis-\npute that the Rule 15 principles could inform the ex-\nceptional circumstances analysis. See Rosenzweig, 332 \nF.3d at 864 (explaining that post-judgment amend-\nment requires appeal or vacatur); In re Ferro Corp. \nDerivative Litig., 511 F.3d 611, 624 (6th Cir. 2008) \n(same); Helm v. Resolution Tr. Corp., 84 F.3d 874, 879 \n(7th Cir. 1996) (same); Bldg. Indus. Ass\u2019n v. Norton, \n247 F.3d 1241, 1245 (D.C. Cir. 2001) (same); Boyd v. \nSecretary, 114 F.4th 1232, 1237 (11th Cir. 2024) \n(same). Indeed, in a case BLOM cites for the proposi-\ntion that \u201cthere is no pending complaint to amend\u201d \nonce \u201cthe action has been dismissed\u201d with prejudice, \nthe opinion noted that courts still apply \u201cRule 15 \nstandards\u201d to such vacatur motions. Calvary Christian \nCenter v. City of Fredericksburg, 710 F.3d 536, 540 \n(4th Cir. 2013). \nTo the extent that any of BLOM\u2019s cases can be read \nto suggest that Rule 15(a)\u2019s preference for determining \ncases on their merits plays no role in motions for post-\njudgment amendment, they are out of step with the \nother circuits. BLOM quotes Garrett v. Wexford \nHealth as holding that under Rule 60(b), \u201c[t]he permis-\nsive policy favoring amendment under Rule 15 was \nsimply not relevant.\u201d 938 F.3d 69, 86 (3d Cir. 2019). \nBut that case cited and relied on Leisure Caviar, 616 \nF.3d at 615-16, which requires courts to weigh the \n\u201ccompeting interests\u201d of Rules 15 and 60. The starker \nlanguage in Garrett was understandable as the \n\n \n \n \n \n \n34 \n \nplaintiff had already amended his complaint four \ntimes, clearly exhausting the policy of liberal amend-\nment.  \nUnsurprisingly, BLOM has selected cases where \nplaintiffs have thoroughly exhausted any chance to \namend. As noted above, Daulatzai involved a motion \nto file a fourth complaint, \u201cpursued in bad faith.\u201d 97 \nF.4th at 170. In James v. Watt, 716 F.2d 71, 77 (1st \nCir. 1983), the delay in amendment was \u201cstrategic.\u201d In \nIn re Ferro, the plaintiff did not have an actual amend-\nment in mind and needed discovery. 511 F.3d at 624. \nSee also Helm, 84 F.3d at 879 (\u201cinexcusable attorney \nnegligence\u201d); UMB Bank, N.A. v. Guerin, 89 F.4th \n1047, 1057-58 (8th Cir. 2024) (proposed second \namended complaint \u201crepeats . . . scandalous, logically \nirrelevant material\u201d and was futile) (internal quota-\ntion marks and citations omitted); Nation, 876 F.3d at \n1174 (plaintiff \u201camended its complaint twice before\u201d \ndismissal).  \nB. Rule 60(b)\u2019s Balancing Means Ensuring \nParties Have a Meaningful Opportunity \nto Amend Pleadings at Least Once, \nWhich Courts Broadly Support. \nIn the Second Circuit, the practical effect of the bal-\nancing inquiry for post-judgment motions to amend is \nfar less dramatic than BLOM suggests: \u201cIn the post-\njudgment context, we have indeed given \u2018due regard\u2019 \nto \u2018the liberal spirit of Rule 15\u2019 by ensuring plaintiffs \nat least one opportunity to replead.\u201d Metzler, 970 F.3d \nat 146 (quoting Williams, 659 F.3d at 213-14). See also \nMandala, 88 F.4th at 362 (same). If the plaintiff has \nhad a meaningful chance to amend, dismissal is no \nlonger extraordinary:  \n\n \n \n \n \n \n35 \n \nIn most if not all Second Circuit cases denying \npost-judgment leave to replead, the plaintiff \nhad already taken at least one shot at amend-\nment. This makes sense: when a plaintiff al-\nready had multiple chances to state a claim, \nthere is little risk of manifest injustice in deny-\ning yet another go. \nId. (citations omitted). \nBut a chance to state a claim is only meaningful if \nthe claimant has been fairly instructed in the correct \nlegal standard, either by a ruling of the district court \nor by clear precedent. Such a ruling identifies actual \nand remediable defects in the complaint, if any. See, \ne.g., United States ex rel. Customs Fraud Investiga-\ntions, LLC v. Victaulic Co., 839 F.3d 242, 250 (3d Cir. \n2016) (observing that without a ruling, \u201ca plaintiff is \nunlikely to know whether his complaint is actually de-\nficient\u2014and in need of revision\u201d); Tate v. SCR Med. \nTransp., 809 F.3d 343, 346 (7th Cir. 2015) (\u201cthe court \nshould grant leave to amend after dismissal of the first \ncomplaint \u2018unless it is certain from the face of the com-\nplaint that any amendment would be futile or other-\nwise unwarranted\u2019\u201d) (citation omitted); United States \nex rel. Lee v. Corinthian Colls., 655 F.3d 984, 998 (9th \nCir. 2011) (\u201c[plaintiffs] should have at least one oppor-\ntunity to add any such facts to the Complaint\u201d); Fire-\nstone v. Firestone, 76 F.3d 1205, 1208 (D.C. Cir. 1996) \n(similar). The Second Circuit noted that it is an \u201cim-\npropriety\u201d to deny amendment \u201cwithout the benefit of \na ruling,\u201d as that presents plaintiffs with a \u201cHobson\u2019s \nchoice: agree to cure deficiencies not yet fully briefed \nand decided or forfeit the opportunity to replead.\u201d Lo-\nreley Fin. (Jersey) No. 3 Ltd. v. Wells Fargo Sec., LLC, \n797 F.3d 160, 190 (2d Cir. 2015). \n\n \n \n \n \n \n36 \n \nOrdinarily, entering judgment dismissing a case \nwithout the opportunity to amend is an abuse of dis-\ncretion. See supra 30-31 (quoting Runnion, 786 F.3d at \n521). See also Jack v. Evonik Corp., 79 F.4th 547, 565 \n(5th Cir. 2023) (\u201cPlaintiffs should usually be able to \namend at least once, because \u2018fairness requires\u2019 it.\u201d) \n(citation omitted). In such case, \u201c[t]he district court left \nthe plaintiff with little recourse but to file a motion \nunder Rules 59(e) and 60(b) . . . .\u201d Foster v. DeLuca, \n545 F.3d 582, 584 (7th Cir. 2008).  \nIn fact, Plaintiffs\u2019 motion here would have come un-\nder Rule 59(e), which BLOM\u2019s cases suggest are eval-\nuated under Rule 15(a)\u2019s liberal standards only, see \nsupra 31-32\u2014if not for the necessity of appealing the \ndistrict court\u2019s erroneous and essentially impossible \npleading standards first. See Mask of Ka-Nefer-Nefer, \n752 F.3d at 743 (explaining that appealing is \u201cthe \nproper recourse\u201d where a dismissal decision is wrong). \nAs the Seventh Circuit explained, \u201ca plaintiff who re-\nceives a Rule 12(b)(6) motion and who has good reason \nto think the complaint is sufficient may also choose to \nstand on the complaint and insist on a decision with-\nout losing the benefit of the well-established liberal \nstandard for amendment with leave of court under \nRule 15(a)(2).\u201d Runnion, 786 F.3d at 523. \nOf course, that entailed a risk\u2014Plaintiffs could \nhave been wrong on appeal. If the Second Circuit had \naffirmed the district court\u2019s reasoning (and not just \noutcome), that would not be an \u201cexceptional circum-\nstance\u201d\u2014that happens routinely and when it does, a \nplaintiff may have made a \u201cfree, calculated, [and] de-\nliberate choice\u201d not to take advantage of any prior op-\nportunities to amend. The circuit\u2019s affirmance on other \ngrounds here was thus fortuitous for BLOM\u2014but that \n\n \n \n \n \n \n37 \n \ndoes not justify elevating finality over the interests of \njustice. \nThis is why BLOM is compelled to argue that the \nSecond Circuit really affirmed dismissal of the case on \nthe same \u201cgrounds\u201d the district court used. Pet.Br.40. \nBut the district court acknowledged its dismissal was \nonly affirmed \u201con other grounds.\u201d Pet.App.10. The Sec-\nond Circuit\u2019s ground for affirmance involved one of the \nsame elements (knowledge), but for a fundamentally \ndifferent reason: the (original and still only) complaint \nrelied too much on \u201cpublicly available evidence\u201d rather \nthan \u201cpublic sources\u201d of information identifying \nBLOM\u2019s customers as Hamas-affiliated entities, and \nits allegation of the latter was too \u201climited.\u201d \nPet.App.51. \nThat the pleading standard was clarified on appeal \nis grounds to permit amendment, not deny it. For ex-\nample, in Tellabs, Inc. v. Makor Issues & Rights, Ltd., \nthis Court explained that \u201c[w]hile we reject the Sev-\nenth Circuit\u2019s approach . . . we do not decide whether, \nunder the standard we have described . . . the Share-\nholders\u2019 allegations\u201d are sufficient. Because the lower \ncourts lacked \u201cthe opportunity to consider the matter \nin light of the prescriptions we announce today,\u201d the \nCourt vacated judgment \u201cso that the case may be reex-\namined in accord with our construction . . . .\u201d 551 U.S. \n308, 329 (2007). And after clarifying the Rule 8 plead-\ning standard in Ashcroft v. Iqbal, this Court ordered \nthat \u201c[t]he Court of Appeals should decide in the first \ninstance whether to remand to the District Court so \nthat respondent can seek leave to amend his deficient \ncomplaint.\u201d 556 U.S. 662, 687 (2009). See also Johnson \nv. City of Shelby, 574 U.S. 10, 12 (2014) (reversing dis-\nmissal with instructions to permit amendment if nec-\nessary). See also Marranzano v. Riggs Nat\u2019l Bank, 184 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n38 \n \nF.2d 349, 351 (D.C. Cir. 1950) (where a decision is \u201caf-\nfirmed\u201d but \u201cbased on an incorrect ground,\u201d the \u201cends \nof justice\u201d require \u201can opportunity to amend [the] com-\nplaint\u201d); Oil, Chem. & Atomic Workers Int\u2019l Union v. \nDelta Ref. Co., 277 F.2d 694, 697 (6th Cir. 1960) \n(where \u201cthe views which we have expressed give the \ncase a somewhat different aspect than it had under the \ntrial court\u2019s ruling,\u201d amendment is appropriate).  \nAfter the Second Circuit affirmed dismissal on \nother grounds in Honickman II, it left Plaintiffs the \nchoice of whether to move for post-judgment leave to \namend, if they thought they had the allegations to do \nso. But as is clear from the subsequent summary order \nbelow remanding the case for further consideration, \nthat affirmance was not intended to preclude Plain-\ntiffs from seeking an opportunity to amend.  \nII. \nThe Second Circuit Did Not Find Waiver, \nand Thus Did Not Alter the Vacatur Stand-\nard in Its Summary Order \nBLOM\u2019s argument hangs on the straw man that \nthe Second Circuit agreed that Plaintiffs \u201cconsistently \nand consciously rejected numerous invitations and op-\nportunities to amend,\u201d but nevertheless \u201cdirected dis-\ntrict courts to override and rescue parties from their \n\u2018free, calculated, [and] deliberate choices.\u2019\u201d Pet.Br.28-\n29 (citations omitted). Although BLOM pressed this \nargument to the circuit below, see BLOM Brief, No. 22-\n1039, Dkt. No. 42, at 1-2, 41-43, the circuit did not find \nany such waiver. To the contrary, it found that the dis-\ntrict court applied a \u201cwrong standard\u201d that was un-\nmeetable. As Judge Wesley asked BLOM\u2019s counsel \nduring the oral argument below, \u201cWhat are [Plaintiffs] \nsupposed to do? They know they can\u2019t amend [to] \n. . . meet\u201d the standard BLOM urged and the district \ncourt adopted. Notably, BLOM does not challenge the \n\n \n \n \n \n \n39 \n \nSecond Circuit\u2019s findings as to waiver in its question \npresented here. \nNevertheless, BLOM attempts to muster evidence \nof occasions when Plaintiffs forfeited opportunities to \namend. The first two \u201copportunities\u201d were the district \ncourt\u2019s invitations to amend before issuing its dismis-\nsal decision. But these opportunities were not mean-\ningful because they offered only to amend in conform-\nity with the incorrect legal standards BLOM urged, \ngiving Plaintiffs no notice of defects under the correct \nlegal standard. See, e.g., Bryant v. Dupree, 252 F.3d \n1161, 1164 (11th Cir. 2001) (\u201cit cannot be said that the \nplaintiffs failed to correct defects of which they had no-\ntice\u201d) (emphasis added). There is no forfeiture where \n\u201cDefendants did not [identify] below\u201d and \u201cthe district \ncourt itself did not rely on the deficiencies we have \nidentified in dismissing\u201d a plaintiff\u2019s claims\u2014espe-\ncially where \u201cthe district court\u2019s reasoning meant that \nno such amendments would remedy the defects that \nthe district court perceived.\u201d Charles Schwab Corp. v. \nBank of Am. Corp., 883 F.3d 68, 89-90 (2d Cir. 2018).  \nAgain, even the district court here acknowledged \nthat its dismissal decision was only affirmed \u201con other \ngrounds.\u201d Pet.App.10. BLOM notes that Plaintiffs \ncould have added some useful additional allegations in \ntheir proposed amended complaint before appealing, \nbut it would have been futile to do so given that Plain-\ntiffs would still have failed to meet each of the district \ncourt\u2019s (erroneous) standards.  \nIndeed, if declining these pre-judgment \u201copportuni-\nties\u201d to amend constituted waiver, litigants would be \ncompelled to file serial (futile) amendments and re-\nbrief Rule 12(b) motions simply to preserve their \nrights to amend post-appeal, which would hardly im-\nprove the efficiency of the lower federal courts or lead \n\n \n \n \n \n \n40 \n \nto more equitable outcomes. Likewise, a rule that dis-\nincentives bringing valid cases \u201cwhere the law [i]s re-\nally recasting itself\u201d in the circuit courts, as Judge \nWesley observed it was here, Oral Arg. at 13:23-38, \ndoes not promote the interests of justice. \nBLOM faults Plaintiffs for not moving for vacatur-\nfor-amendment instead of appealing, or not appealing \nthe with-prejudice nature of the dismissal. Pet.Br.11. \nPlaintiffs did not seek vacatur before appealing be-\ncause there is \u201cno reason\u201d to \u201cfile a post-judgment mo-\ntion seeking leave to amend\u201d where \u201cthe district \ncourt\u2019s reasoning meant that no such amendments \nwould remedy the defects that the district court per-\nceived.\u201d Charles Schwab, 883 F.3d at 90. Again, \u201cthe \nproper recourse when [a party] disagreed with the dis-\ntrict court\u2019s interpretation of the . . . statute was a di-\nrect appeal, not a Rule 60(b) motion.\u201d Mask of Ka-\nNefer-Nefer, 752 F.3d at 743. And Plaintiffs did not \nappeal the \u201cwith-prejudice\u201d component of the dismis-\nsal decision because leave to amend would not have \naltered the result without the circuit first correcting \nthe district court\u2019s legal errors.  \nFinally, BLOM also faults Plaintiffs for not asking \nthe circuit court for leave to amend in their post-argu-\nment supplemental brief in Honickman II. Pet.Br.11. \nThough asking the circuit for leave to amend is per-\nmissible, in the Second Circuit, post-judgment leave to \namend is generally a decision for the district court to \nmake \u201cin the first instance.\u201d Iqbal v. Ashcroft, 574 F.3d \n820, 822 (2d Cir. 2009).6 The circuit court\u2019s job is to \n \n6  \nBLOM also faults Plaintiffs for \u201cnot seek[ing] rehearing,\u201d \nPet.Br.12, but in the Mandala dissent BLOM relies on, Judge Sul-\nlivan criticized precisely that: \u201c[r]ather than seek vacatur and \nleave to amend\u201d after the first appeal, \u201cPlaintiffs instead opted to \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n41 \n \nassess the district court\u2019s ruling\u2014it goes without say-\ning that if a viable amendment is necessary, plaintiffs \nwill want to make it. The summary order demon-\nstrates that the circuit court did not find a need for \nPlaintiffs to have requested leave to amend from the \nfirst panel (Judge Wesley was on both unanimous pan-\nels). \nIII. \nThe Balancing Inquiry Does Not Conflict \nwith the Text of Any of the Federal Rules of \nCivil Procedure. \nBLOM argues that the Second Circuit\u2019s precedent \nconflicts with the plain text of Rule 15(a) and Rule \n60(b). To do so, it erroneously construes the Second \nCircuit\u2019s basis for remand as \u201callow[ing] plaintiffs to \nleapfrog over \u2018Rule 60(b)\u2019s finality gauntlet\u2019 to the \nsanctuary of \u2018Rule 15(a)\u2019s liberal repleading policy.\u2019\u201d \nPet.Br.30. Again, the Second Circuit directs district \ncourts to balance Rule 60(b)\u2019s finality and Rule 15(a)\u2019s \nliberality \u201cin tandem,\u201d Pet.App.7; it does not permit \n\u201cleapfrogging.\u201d See Meltzer, 970 F.3d at 146 (finding \nthe \u201cargument that the [post-judgment] motion is gov-\nerned solely by the legal standard applicable to Rule \n15(a)(2) motions . . . without merit.\u201d). \nTo establish a textual conflict, BLOM argues that \nRule 15(a) \u201capplies only to \u2018Amendments Before \nTrial,\u2019\u201d and \u201c[i]t is in that setting . . . that the Rules \nencourage courts to \u2018freely give leave\u2019 to amend.\u201d \nPet.Br.30. Thus, BLOM suggests, Rule 15\u2019s preference \n \nfile a petition for rehearing en banc\u2014a strategic choice that \nplainly undermines any argument that some aspect of the district \ncourt\u2019s order was an \u2018extraordinary circumstance\u2019 preventing \nPlaintiffs from pursuing their claims.\u201d 88 F.4th at 368. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n42 \n \nfor deciding cases on their merits is entirely extin-\nguished at judgment.  \nBut Rule 15 contemplates two stages of amend-\nment\u2014before trial and during or after trial. Both in-\nvolve \u201cfreely\u201d giving leave to amend, under certain cir-\ncumstances which depend on trial, not judgment. See \nRule 15(a)(2), Rule 15(b)(1). The rule has no higher \nstandard. \nIndeed, \n\u201c\u2018[a]mendments \nunder \n[Rule \n15(a)(2)] may be made at any stage of the litigation.\u2019 \nGranting leave to amend after summary judgment is \nthus allowed at the discretion of the trial court.\u201d Ngu-\nyen v. United States, 792 F.2d 1500, 1502 (9th Cir. \n1986) (quoting 6 C. Wright & A. Miller, Federal Prac-\ntice and Procedure \u00a7 1484 (1971)). See also Dussouy v. \nGulf Coast Inv. Corp., 660 F.2d 594, 598 (5th Cir. \n1981) (applying Rule 15 and noting that \u201c[i]nstances \nabound in which appellate courts on review have re-\nquired that leave to amend be granted after dismissal \nor entry of judgment\u201d). \nObviously, this case was not dismissed after trial\u2014\nit was dismissed following an initial Rule 12(b)(6) mo-\ntion, before Plaintiffs had the opportunity to try to \ncure any actual defects in their complaint. That is pre-\ncisely the context that Rule 15(a) squarely addresses. \nEntering judgment does not eliminate Rule 15(a)\u2019s \npreference for \u201cresolving disputes on their merits.\u201d \nKrupski, 560 U.S. at 550. \nBLOM argues that Rule 15(a) \u201cdoes not provide a \nmechanism for amending pleadings after dismissal,\u201d \nPet.Br.30, but that is likewise irrelevant. To the extent \nRule 60(b)(6) provides the \u201cmechanism,\u201d it is an \u201cex-\nception to finality\u201d for \u201cany reason that justifies relief.\u201d \nGranting leave to amend \u201cwhen justice so requires,\u201d as \nRule 15(a) commands, presumably informs the \n\n \n \n \n \n \n43 \n \nreasons that \u201cjustify relief\u201d under Rule 60(b)(6)\u2014in-\ncluding providing an opportunity to amend at least \nonce.7  \nBLOM asserts that the Second Circuit\u2019s \u201cbalancing \ntest\u201d conflicts with the rest of Rule 60(b) because it \nwould permit plaintiffs to \u201cevade those explicit time \nlimitations in\u201d Rule 60(b)(1) (relief given mistake or \nexcusable neglect) and Rule 60(b)(2) (relief given new \nevidence). Pet.Br.31-33. But the Second Circuit has \nnever suggested that vacatur and amendment are per-\nmissible where a complaint failed due to counsel\u2019s mis-\ntake or where a plaintiff simply wants to present new \nevidence over a year after judgment. Instead, a district \ncourt\u2019s failure to give plaintiffs at least one meaningful \nopportunity to replead may constitute extraordinary \ncircumstances, and vacatur and amendment may be \nappropriate.  \nIn Mandala, the Second Circuit determined which \nprovision of Rule 60(b) applied before turning to the \npolicies and standards of either Rule 60(b) or Rule \n15(a): \u201cProper characterization of Plaintiffs\u2019 Rule 60(b) \nmotion is a threshold issue because, as previously ex-\nplained, [Rule 60(b)\u2019s] provisions are subject to differ-\nent filing limitations . . . .\u201d 88 F.4th at 359. The Second \nCircuit determined that Rule 60(b)(6) was the proper \nrule because \u201cinsufficient pleading is not categorically \na \u2018mistake,\u2019 and Plaintiffs\u2019 belief that their Complaint \nsatisfied the standards for pleading a disparate impact \nclaim was well-founded, even if ultimately erroneous.\u201d \nId. \n \n7  \nBLOM contends that this Court should read Rule 60(b) \nwith Rule 1, not Rule 15(a). Pet.Br.35-38. But Rule 1 does not \nnegate Rule 15\u2014to the extent Rule 1 provides any guidance here, \nit is its command to secure the \u201cjust\u201d outcome. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n44 \n \nNor does the decision below conflict with Rule \n60(b)(2), which only permits vacatur to introduce (1) \nnewly discovered evidence (2) within a year of judg-\nment. The Second Circuit does not permit post-judg-\nment amendments \u201cbased on previously omitted alle-\ngations,\u201d as BLOM asserts (or evidence discovered \nover a year after judgment). Pet.Br.33. In fact, Metzler \nrejected an attempt to circumvent Rule 60(b)(2)\u2019s \n\u201cnewly discovered evidence standard.\u201d 970 F.3d at 146. \nThat case still required a showing of extraordinary cir-\ncumstances under Rule 60(b)(6). BLOM points out \nthat movants might introduce allegations they could \nhave presented before, Pet.Br.33, but Rule 60(b) gives \nreasons for vacating a judgment\u2014it does not limit \nwhat a party can include in an amended pleading once \nvacatur and leave to amend are granted. \nTo be clear, BLOM no longer appears to contest \nthat Rule 60(b)(6) applies in this case. The district \ncourt itself found that Rule 60(b)(6) applied here, not-\ning that \u201cnone of [the other provisions] are applicable\u201d \nto Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for vacatur. Pet.App.12. BLOM \ndid nevertheless argue to the panel below that Rule \n60(b)(1) applied, but the circuit did not accept the ar-\ngument, assessing the case under Rule 60(b)(6). See \nPet.App.6-7. BLOM did not challenge the district \ncourt\u2019s or circuit court\u2019s application of Rule 60(b)(6) in \nits petition for certiorari or in their merits brief to this \nCourt. \nIV. \nExtraordinary Circumstances Are Present \nHere Because After Honickman II Clarified \nthe Previously \u201cAmbigu[ous]\u201d Legal Stand-\nards, Plaintiffs Were Denied Any Oppor-\ntunity to Meet Them. \nAs this Court has explained, \u201c[i]n determining \nwhether extraordinary circumstances are present \n\n \n \n \n \n \n45 \n \n[under Rule 60(b)(6)], a court may consider a wide \nrange of factors,\u201d including \u201c\u2018the risk of injustice to the \nparties\u2019 and \u2018the risk of undermining the public\u2019s con-\nfidence in the judicial process.\u2019\u201d Buck, 580 U.S. at 123 \n(quoting Liljeberg, 486 U.S. at 864). In Mandala, the \nSecond Circuit noted several factors in that case that \nestablished exceptional circumstances for purposes of \na motion for post-judgment amendment: \n[1] Plaintiffs have yet to be afforded a single op-\nportunity to amend their pleading; [2] the orig-\ninal dismissal of the Complaint was premised \non grounds subject to reasonable, actual, and \nvigorous debate; [3] Plaintiffs diligently prose-\ncuted their case at all times; and [4] Plaintiffs\u2019 \nproposed amendments address the sole plead-\ning deficiency identified by the district court.  \n88 F.4th at 365.  \nPlaintiffs meet all of these factors here. Denying \nPlaintiffs leave to amend risks injustice, as they may \nlose their only opportunity to have this case decided on \nthe merits, as the statute of limitations has run on \ntheir claims. See LeBlanc v. Cleveland, 248 F.3d 95, \n101 (2d Cir. 2001) (finding \u201c\u2018extraordinary circum-\nstances\u2019 under Rule 60(b)(6), because [plaintiff] would \nbe left without a remedy if the motion [for vacatur and \nleave to amend] were not granted\u201d). And where the \ncase is at its earliest stage, with no discovery con-\nducted, the prejudice to BLOM is limited solely to \nbriefing a new motion to dismiss against allegations \ntailored to meet the legal standards articulated by the \nSecond Circuit and this Court in Taamneh. The poten-\ntial burden of re-briefing a motion to dismiss is already \nbuilt into Rules 15(a)(1) and (2) and is not the kind of \nprejudice that the Rule considers. See, e.g., Patton v. \nGuyer, 443 F.2d 79, 86 (10th Cir. 1971) (\u201cThere is \n\n \n \n \n \n \n46 \n \ninvariably some practical prejudice resulting from an \namendment, but this is not the test for refusal of an \namendment. . . . The defendants were not prejudiced \nin terms of preparing their defense to the amend-\nment.\u201d). \nIndeed, courts have applied more liberal standards \nto motions for post-judgment amendment at early \nstages in the litigation. For example, the Fifth Circuit \nheld that \u201cthe Rule 15 standards apply when a party \nseeks to amend a judgment that has been entered \nbased on the pleadings,\u201d but doubted whether those \nstandards would apply \u201cafter trial.\u201d S. Constructors \nGrp. v. Dynalectric Co., 2 F.3d 606, 611 (5th Cir. 1993). \nSee also Duggins v. Steak \u2018n Shake, Inc., 195 F.3d 828, \n834 (6th Cir. 1999) (holding that amendment risks sig-\nnificant prejudice \u201cafter the close of discovery\u201d); Ru-\notolo v. City of N.Y., 514 F.3d 184, 187, 192 (2d Cir. \n2008) (similar).  \nPlaintiffs have also yet to be afforded a single \nmeaningful opportunity to amend their complaint; the \nbasis for the original dismissal of the complaint was \nnot merely open to \u201cvigorous debate,\u201d Mandala, 88 \nF.4th at 365, but entirely incorrect; Plaintiffs dili-\ngently prosecuted their case, appealing and moving for \nvacatur expeditiously; and Plaintiffs\u2019 proposed amend-\nments could address the actual defects in the com-\nplaint that the Second Circuit identified.  \nBLOM argues that no extraordinary circumstances \nare present here because (1) the district court\u2019s deci-\nsion was affirmed on the same grounds it provided; (2) \nPlaintiffs waived any \u201cright\u201d to an amendment be-\ncause they did not take the district court\u2019s invitations \nto amend; (3) even if the district court was wrong, a \nclarification or change in law is not an extraordinary \ncircumstance; and (4) Plaintiffs are at \u201cfault\u201d for \n\n \n \n \n \n \n47 \n \nfailing to amend or delaying doing so. Pet.Br.39-45. \nThe first two reasons are addressed above: the dismis-\nsal decision was premised on \u201cthe wrong legal stand-\nard,\u201d and the Second Circuit did not find that Plaintiffs \n\u201cwaived\u201d any meaningful opportunities to amend.  \nBLOM asserts that \u201cmere clarification of the law is \nnot extraordinary,\u201d as it \u201cis what appellate courts do \nday in and day out\u201d\u2014and, in fact, \u201cthis Court has held \nthat even an outright change in the law does not war-\nrant relief under Rule 60(b)(6).\u201d Pet.Br.19 (citing Gon-\nzalez, 545 U.S. at 537). But in Gonzalez, the change in \nlaw was made in another case after the case under re-\nview was decided, leading this Court to remark: \u201c[i]t is \nhardly extraordinary that subsequently, after peti-\ntioner\u2019s case was no longer pending, this Court arrived \nat a different interpretation.\u201d 545 U.S. at 537. Moreo-\nver, Mr. Gonzalez failed to show sufficient diligence \nbecause he did not \u201cseek review of the District Court\u2019s \ndecision\u201d on the issue relating to his vacatur motion. \nId.  \nHere the \u201cclarification\u201d came in the same case, as a \nresult of Plaintiffs\u2019 appeal. See Charles Schwab, 883 \nF.3d at 89-90. The Second Circuit \u201cacknowledge[d] the \ndistrict court\u2019s decision came before our opinion \nin Kaplan [II] clarified the import of our earlier \nJASTA aiding-and-abetting precedents which may \nhave generated some ambiguity as to the proper \nstandard.\u201d Pet.App.40 n.11. It is manifestly unfair to \nexpect Plaintiffs to fully understand a set of legal \nstandards that were still being \u201crecast[],\u201d Oral Arg. at \n13:23-38, when the district court could not. \nBLOM argues in the alternative that if the Second \nCircuit\u2019s clarification was \u201cin line with [Plaintiffs\u2019] \nown interpretation\u201d of JASTA, Plaintiffs \u201cnever \u2018ex-\nplain[ed] why they did not allege facts sufficient to \n\n \n \n \n \n \n48 \n \nsatisfy the standard for which they were advocating.\u2019\u201d \nPet.Br.41 (quoting Pet.App.17 n.5). But while Plain-\ntiffs were indeed broadly correct about JASTA\u2019s plead-\ning standards\u2014a fact that BLOM argues somehow \ncounts against them\u2014they could not anticipate the ev-\nidentiary distinction newly articulated by the Second \nCircuit between \u201cpublicly available evidence\u201d and \n\u201cpublic sources.\u201d \nIn fact, this Court has held that even a change in \nlaw in another case can constitute extraordinary cir-\ncumstances. See Kemp v. United States, 596 U.S. 528, \n540 (2022) (noting \u201cthe availability of Rule 60(b)(6) to \nreopen a judgment in extraordinary circumstances, in-\ncluding a change in controlling law\u201d and citing cases) \n(Sotomayor, J., concurring). For example, a change in \nlaw relating to the same incident justified reversing a \nthree-year-old denial of certiorari, because \u201cthe inter-\nest in finality of litigation must yield where the inter-\nests of justice would make unfair the strict application \nof our rules\u201d\u2014another recitation of the balancing test. \nGondeck v. Pan Am. World Airways, Inc., 382 U.S. 25, \n26-28 (1965). The Tenth Circuit also found such a \nchange in law in another case an \u201cextraordinary situ-\nation justifying Rule 60(b)(6) relief.\u201d Pierce v. Cook & \nCo., 518 F.2d 720, 723-24 (10th Cir. 1975) (en banc). \nThe interests of justice and demands of fairness are \neven more pronounced when the relevant \u201cchange in \nlaw\u201d occurs in the same case.  \nPetitioner\u2019s fourth waiver argument is wrong as \nwell: unlike BLOM\u2019s cases rejecting post-judgment \namendments that were strategically delayed like \nJames and Rozensweig, Plaintiffs here are not at any \n\u201cfault\u201d and did not engage in any \u201cgamesmanship.\u201d \nPet.Br.27, 33, 36, 44. They timely appealed the district \ncourt\u2019s incorrect dismissal decision and, once \u201c[a]rmed \n\n \n \n \n \n \n49 \n \nwith [the Second Circuit\u2019s] clarifications,\u201d promptly \nmoved for vacatur and leave to amend. There was no \n\u201cundue delay\u201d\u2014although \u201cdelay alone, regardless of \nits length is not enough to bar [amendment] if the \nother party is not prejudiced.\u201d Moore v. Paducah, 790 \nF.2d 557, 560 (6th Cir. 1986) (quoting 3 Moore\u2019s Fed-\neral Practice, para. 15.08 at 15.76). As explained \nabove, BLOM would not be unduly prejudiced by vaca-\ntur and amendment here. \nCONCLUSION \nBLOM quotes extensively from Ackermann v. \nUnited States to argue that \u201c\u2018[t]here must be an end to \nlitigation someday . . . .\u201d Pet.Br.1, 29 (quoting 340 U.S. \n193, 198 (1950)). BLOM\u2019s comparison of Ackermann to \nthis case is illustrative of its arguments generally. In \nAckermann, the petitioners sought vacatur four years \nafter judgments were entered following a trial, in or-\nder to bring an extremely late appeal. This case has \nnever even entered discovery. See Dubicz v. Common-\nwealth Edison Co., 377 F.3d 787, 793 n.1 (7th Cir. \n2004) (\u201cIt is important to emphasize that this litiga-\ntion has never progressed beyond the pleadings stage. \nThis is not the case where a plaintiff seeks to amend \nits complaint after the close of discovery or on the eve \nof trial.\u201d). Plaintiffs did file a timely and necessary ap-\npeal. Dismissal here is hardly what this Court in \nAckermann meant by \u201csomeday.\u201d \nThe judgment of the court of appeals should be af-\nfirmed and the case should be remanded for further \nproceedings.  \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n50 \n \nRespectfully submitted, \n \n \n \nMichael Radine \n Counsel of Record \nGary M.

          "task_beliefs": "My understanding of this case continues to solidify around the central procedural conflict between Rule 60(b)(6)'s \"extraordinary circumstances\" standard for vacating judgments and Rule 15(a)'s liberal standard for amending complaints. The Petition for a Writ of Certiorari provided the petitioner's powerful framing of this issue, which remains the core of my analysis. The petitioner, BLOM Bank, argues that the Second Circuit's new \"balancing test\" creates a deep and lopsided 11-1 circuit split, a claim that, if true, is one of the most compelling reasons for the Supreme Court to grant review and reverse. The petitioner also leverages key precedents on finality (*Gonzalez v. Crosby*) and the requirements for Rule 60(b)(6) relief, arguing that the respondents were not \"faultless\" (*Pioneer*, *Ackermann*) but instead made a \"calculated, deliberate choice\" to stand on their initial complaint despite multiple opportunities to amend. This narrative, combined with citations to former-Justice Breyer's First Circuit opinion in *James v. Watt*, creates a strong case for reversal.\n\nThe latest observation, which is an internal reasoning step, does not introduce new external facts but critically refines my predictive model by formalizing the primary source of uncertainty. My belief in the strength of the petitioner's argument is now high, but this belief is provisional. The observation clarifies that the most significant unknown variable is the respondents' counter-argument. My predictive focus has now shifted to answering specific questions:\n1.  How will the respondents characterize the alleged 11-1 circuit split? Will they argue the split is non-existent, shallow, or that the cases are factually distinguishable?\n2.  How will the respondents justify their decision not to amend the complaint earlier? What is their counter-narrative to the petitioner's claim of a \"calculated, deliberate choice\"?\n\nMy current prediction leans heavily toward reversal, but this is contingent on the weakness of the forthcoming respondents' brief. The next piece of evidence\u2014the Brief in Opposition\u2014is now the most valuable potential observation for resolving this uncertainty and moving toward a final prediction.",
          "design_beliefs": "My design philosophy has evolved from simply gathering documents to a more strategic, dialectical approach to legal analysis. The initial heuristics remain highly valuable:\n\n1.  **Source Prioritization:** The Petition for a Writ of Certiorari is confirmed as the highest-signal initial document. Procedural filings can be safely deprioritized.\n2.  **The \"Circuit Split\" Heuristic:** Identifying claims of a circuit split in the \"Reasons for Granting the Petition\" section is the most efficient first step in assessing a case's cert-worthiness and merits. The claimed depth of the split (11-1) is a primary indicator of the case's significance.\n3.  **Strategic Framing Analysis:** It is essential to analyze not just the legal rules but how a party frames the facts to fit those rules (e.g., \"calculated choice\" vs. \"faultless victim\").\n4.  **Iterative Information Gathering:** The process is one of claim and verification. The petitioner's claims point directly to the necessary next steps: verifying the split and seeking the counter-argument.\n\nThe most recent observation adds a crucial new layer to this methodology, which I will call the **Dialectical Analysis Heuristic**:\n5.  **The Dialectical Analysis Heuristic:** In an adversarial system, a prediction based on one party's argument is inherently incomplete and high-risk. After analyzing the moving party's primary brief (the Petition), the action with the highest expected information gain is to acquire and analyze the opposing party's primary response (the Brief in Opposition). This step is not merely additive; it is essential for understanding the core tensions of the case and assessing the relative strength of the competing legal narratives. This heuristic explicitly prioritizes understanding the rebuttal to the strongest arguments, as this is where a case is often won or lost. This process of analyzing claim and counterclaim is the most reliable path to a robust prediction."

Respondents do not seriously \ndispute that the Second Circuit\u2019s dilution of Rule \n60(b)\u2019s stringent standard places it on the short end of \na lopsided circuit split.  In fact, Respondents entirely \nignore the conflicting decisions of several Courts of \nAppeals.  And they get no further with their efforts to \ndistinguish a few bricks in the wall of precedents from \nevery other Circuit that has rejected the Second \nCircuit\u2019s outlier approach.  Those decisions make clear \nthat the Second Circuit is now \u201calone in the Nation in \ncollapsing the Rule 60(b) standard with the standard \nfor Rule 15(a).\u201d  Daulatzai v. Maryland, 97 F.4th 166, \n177 (4th Cir. 2024). \nRespondents similarly do not dispute that, \u201c[t]o \njustify relief under [Rule 60(b)(6)], a party must show \n\u2018extraordinary circumstances\u2019 suggesting that the \nparty is faultless.\u201d  Pioneer Inv. Servs. v. Brunswick \nAssocs. Ltd. P\u2019ship, 507 U.S. 380, 393 (1993).  Nor do \nthey dispute that, in this case, their repeated decisions \nnot to amend were \u201cfree, calculated, [and] deliberate.\u201d  \nAckermann v. United States, 340 U.S. 193, 198 (1950).  \nThat should foreclose the extraordinary relief \nRespondents seek here.  \nInstead, Respondents\u2019 primary response is to fault \nthe Petition for not discussing Foman v. Davis, 371 \nU.S. 178 (1962).  But there is a very good reason for \nthat:  Foman involved a Rule 59(e) motion, while this \ncase concerns a Rule 60(b) motion.  \u201cThe difference \nbetween the two rules . . . is material, both in scope \nand purpose, and, by their own terms, different \nstandards apply.\u201d  Daulatzai, 97 F.4th at 177.  Indeed, \n\n2 \nthis Court recently emphasized that very point in \nBanister v. Davis, 590 U.S. 504 (2020), when it refused \nto conflate the two Rules in the habeas context.  Thus, \nFoman\u2019s discussion of Rule 59(e) does not affect the \nRule 60(b)(6) analysis here.   \nInstead, the relevant precedent is this Court\u2019s \ndecision in Gonzalez v. Crosby, which held that a \n60(b)(6) motion \u201crequires a showing of \u2018extraordinary \ncircumstances.\u2019\u201d  545 U.S. 524, 536 (2005).  The Second \nCircuit\u2019s decisions squarely conflict with Gonzalez by \neschewing Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s stringent rule in favor of a \n\u201cliberal repleading policy.\u201d  Pet.App.8.  No other \nCircuit has adopted that misguided approach.   \nUnable to wash away the circuit split or the Second \nCircuit\u2019s disregard for this Court\u2019s precedent, \nRespondents try to ward off review by labeling this \ncase \u201cinterlocutory.\u201d  But that is patently incorrect.  \nThis appeal arises from Respondents\u2019 attempt to \nvacate a final judgment that was entered nearly five \nyears ago.  And the ruling denying that motion was \nitself a final order.  Relief from this Court would thus \nfinally end this case, while denying review would \nthwart the efficiency and finality principles that \nanimate the Federal Rules. \nIn the end, the Second Circuit\u2019s unprecedented \ndilution of Rule 60(b)(6) conflicts with this Court\u2019s \ndecisions and those of every other Circuit.  It threatens \nto undermine the finality of judgments.  It encourages \nwasteful litigation tactics.  And, as a matter of law, the \ndecision below is simply wrong.  This Court should \ngrant review and reverse.   \n\n3 \nARGUMENT \nI. \nThe Second Circuit\u2019s Approach Conflicts \nWith That Of Eleven Other Circuits.  \nRespondents concede the existence of a circuit split \nby failing to address the conflicting decisions \nPetitioner identified from the First, Third, Eighth, \nEleventh, and D.C. Circuits.  Although Respondents \ncherry-pick quotes from some of the others, a review \nof those decisions confirms an irreconcilable split \nbetween the Second Circuit\u2019s newly developed test for \nRule 60(b) motions and the correct test used in the rest \nof the Courts of Appeals. \nA. Respondents Concede that a Circuit Split \nExists.   \nRespondents \ncompletely \nignore \nthen-Judge \nBreyer\u2019s decision for the First Circuit in James v. \nWatt, 716 F.2d 71 (1983).  There, as here, the First \nCircuit confronted a district court\u2019s denial of a post-\njudgment motion to amend a dismissed complaint.  Id. \nat 77.  In affirming, then-Judge Breyer explained that \n\u201cto require the district court to permit amendment \nhere would allow plaintiffs to pursue a case to \njudgment and then, if they lose, to reopen the case by \namending their complaint to take account of the \ncourt\u2019s decision.\u201d  Id. at 78.  The First Circuit rebuked \nthat approach because it \u201cwould dramatically \nundermine the ordinary rules governing the finality of \njudicial decisions.\u201d  Id.  That reasoning flatly \ncontradicts the \u201cliberal amendment policy\u201d endorsed \nby the Second Circuit.  Pet.App.7.  But Respondents \ndo not even acknowledge the case. \n\n4 \nRespondents also ignore the Third Circuit\u2019s \ndecision in Garrett v. Wexford Health, 938 F.3d 69 (3d \nCir. 2019).  In Garrett, the Third Circuit explained \nthat, when a party seeks \u201cto reopen a final judgment, \nthe policy favoring the finality of judgments\u201d is \nimplicated, and \u201c[t]he permissive policy favoring \namendment under Rule 15 [is] simply not relevant.\u201d  \nId. at 86.  Accordingly, \u201c[i]n the post-judgment context, \nthe narrow grounds for relief set forth\u201d in Rule 60(b) \n\u201cmust guide a District Court\u2019s decision about whether \nan otherwise-final judgment should  be disturbed.\u201d  Id.\nThe Third Circuit therefore recognizes\u2014unlike the \nSecond Circuit\u2014that \u201ca different set of rules \nemphasizing vastly different policies\u201d pertain to a \nmotion seeking to vacate a final judgment for the \npurposes of amending a complaint.  Id.\nRespondents likewise ignore the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s \ndecision in MacPhee v. MiMedx Grp., Inc., 73 F.4th \n1220 (11th Cir. 2023).  As in this case, the district \ncourt there denied the plaintiff\u2019s motion for post-\njudgment vacatur-for-amendment, \u201cexplaining that \nbecause [the plaintiff] waited until after judgment was \nentered to seek such relief, Rule 15(a) did not apply.\u201d  \nId. at 1238.  Unless the plaintiff could first show \n\u201centitle[ment] to relief under Rule 59(e) or 60(b),\u201d it \n\u201cwas not entitled to leave to amend post-judgment.\u201d  \nId.  The Eleventh Circuit affirmed, embracing this \nrestrictive approach even \u201cwhere the plaintiff has not \nexercised its right under Rule 15(a)(1) to amend as a \nmatter of course.\u201d  Id. at 1250.  Again, that is directly \nat odds with the Second Circuit\u2019s belief that plaintiffs \nneed not \u201cnavigate Rule 60(b)\u2019s finality gauntlet before \nthey [can] invoke Rule 15(a)\u2019s liberal repleading \n\n5 \npolicy.\u201d  Pet.App.8.  And, again, Respondents \nconspicuously fail to address it.  \nThe same goes for UMB Bank, N.A. v. Guerin, 89 \nF.4th 1047 (8th Cir. 2024).  As the Eighth Circuit held \nthere, \u201cthe liberal amendment standard in Rule \n15(a)(2) does not govern\u201d for post-judgment motions \nseeking to amend a complaint.  Id. at 1057. Instead, \n\u201ca more restrictive standard reflecting interests of \nfinality applies.\u201d  Id. (citation omitted).  That is, \n\u201c[l]eave to amend will be granted if\u201d\u2014and only if\u2014\u201cit \nis consistent with the stringent standards governing \nthe grant of Rule 59(e) and Rule 60(b) relief.\u201d  Id.\n(cleaned up).  Respondents once again ignore this \ndecision, which squarely conflicts with the Second \nCircuit\u2019s requirement that district courts \u201cbalance \nRule 60(b)\u2019s finality principles and Rule 15(a)\u2019s liberal \npleading principles.\u201d  Pet.App.7; see also Mandala v. \nNTT Data, 88 F.4th 353, 361 (2d Cir. 2023).   \nRespondents similarly ignore the D.C. Circuit\u2019s \nholding that \u201cRule 60(b)(6) is not an opportunity for \nunsuccessful litigants to take a mulligan.\u201d  Kramer v. \nGates, 481 F.3d 788, 792 (D.C. Cir. 2007).  To be sure, \nRespondents obliquely note that the D.C. Circuit has \nallowed \npost-judgment \namendment \nin \n\u201ccertain \ncircumstances.\u201d  BIO.27.  But those are where the \nmovant has \u201cprevailed on the claim in question.\u201d  Bldg. \nIndus. Ass\u2019n v. Norton, 247 F.3d 1241, 1245 (D.C. Cir. \n2007) (emphasis added).  That is not the case here.  \nRespondents\u2019 claims were dismissed with prejudice, \nand that dismissal was affirmed on appeal.  \n\n6 \nIn short, by their own omissions, Respondents \nconcede the decision below conflicts with decisions \nfrom the First, Third, Eighth, Eleventh, and D.C. \nCircuits.  That alone should warrant review. \nB. Respondents\u2019 Discussion of Other Circuit \nDecisions \nConfirms \nthat \nthe \nSecond \nCircuit Has Adopted an Outlier Approach. \nThe circuit split extends far beyond the cases \nRespondents ignore.   \nMost notably, in Daulatzai, the Fourth Circuit \nspecifically rejected the Second Circuit\u2019s approach in a \nthoroughly reasoned opinion.   See 97 F.4th at 180.  \nThe Fourth Circuit affirmed the district court\u2019s denial \nof a Rule 60(b) motion.  In so doing, the Fourth Circuit \nconfronted the exact error that the Second Circuit \ncommitted in Mandala and this case.  It expressly \n\u201creject[ed] \nDaulatzai\u2019s \nargument\u201d \nthat \nearlier \nprecedents \u201ccollapsing . . . the standards under Rule \n59(e) and Rule 15(a) should also apply when the \nmotion seeks relief from the judgment under Rule \n60(b).\u201d  Id. at 179 (emphases added).  Thus, unlike the \nSecond Circuit, the Fourth Circuit has correctly held \nthat, \u201cwhen the motion to vacate is filed under Rule \n60(b), the more restrictive standard for granting that \nmotion must be satisfied before consideration can be \ngiven to the motion to amend.\u201d  Id. at 179 (emphasis \nadded).  By contrast, the Second Circuit here faulted \nthe District Court for \u201ctreat[ing] Plaintiffs\u2019 motion to \nvacate and amend as calling for two distinct analyses\u201d \nunder Rule 60(b) and then Rule 15(a).  Pet.App.7-8; see \n\n7 \nalso Mandala 88 F.4th at 361.  The two approaches \nare impossible to square.1\nRespondents only further underscore this error by \ntrying to leverage a pair of Second Circuit decisions \naddressing Rule 59(e) to suggest its approach is \nconsistent with the law of other Circuits.  See BIO.21-\n23 (discussing Metzler Investment Gmbh v. Chipotle \nMexican Grill, Inc., 970 F.3d 133 (2d Cir. 2020) and \nWilliams v. Citigroup Inc., 659 F.3d 208 (2d Cir. 2011) \n(per curiam)).  But whether those earlier cases are \nconsistent with other Circuits\u2019 Rule 59(e) cases does \nnot alter the fact that the Second Circuit\u2019s treatment \nof Rule 60(b) motions seeking to replead sharply \nconflicts with the decisions of every other Circuit \napplying Rule 60(b).  On that latter issue, which is the \nquestion presented here, the Second Circuit has \nabandoned the extraordinary-circumstances standard \nto require district courts \u201cto consider Rule 60(b) \nfinality and Rule 15(a) liberality in tandem.\u201d  \nPet.App.7.  In other words, it has forbade district \ncourts from analyzing Rule 60(b) motions \u201cunder only \nRule 60(b)\u2019s standard.\u201d  Id.   \nThat clashes with the otherwise unanimous view of \nthe Courts of Appeals, which have consistently held \nthat plaintiffs \u201cmust first meet the threshold \n1 Rather than confront the Fourth Circuit\u2019s thoughtful analysis \nin Daulatzai, Respondents suggest the Fourth Circuit must have \nbeen aware of the Second Circuit\u2019s decisions in Mandala and \nHonickman.  BIO.23.  But the Second Circuit issued its mistaken \nopinions after Daulatzai was argued on October 24, 2023.  And \nthe docket in Daulatzai reflects that neither party filed a Rule \n28(j) letter bringing either Mandala or this case to the Fourth \nCircuit\u2019s attention.  It is thus no surprise that the Fourth Circuit \ndid not mention the Second Circuit\u2019s erroneous decisions. \n\n8 \nrequirement of 60(b)(6)\u2019s extraordinary or exceptional \ncircumstances to vacate the judgment before\u201d \ninvoking Rule 15(a)\u2019s liberal amendment policy.  In re \nFerro Corp. Deriv. Litig., 511 F.3d 611, 624 (6th Cir. \n2008) (emphasis added); see also, e.g., Ewing v. 1645 \nW. Farragut LLC, 90 F.4th 876, 893 (7th Cir. 2024); \nNavajo Nation v. Dep\u2019t of the Interior, 876 F.3d 1144, \n1173 (9th Cir. 2017); Rosenzweig v. Azurix Corp., 332 \nF.3d 854, 864 (5th Cir. 2003); Cooper v. Shumway, 780 \nF.2d 27, 28 (10th Cir. 1985) (per curiam). \nThis Court should thus grant certiorari to remedy \nthe split and confirm that losing litigants may not \ndeploy the policies of Rule 15(a) to bypass Rule 60(b)\u2019s \nexacting requirements for relief. \nII. Respondents\u2019 Reliance On Foman Only \nReinforces The Fundament Flaws In The \nSecond Circuit\u2019s Approach.  \nNot only are Respondents\u2019 efforts to obscure the \ncircuit split unavailing, but their attempt to defend \nthe \ndecision \nbelow \nonly \nfurther \nreveals \nthe \nfundamental legal error in the Second Circuit\u2019s outlier \napproach.  Respondents rely principally on this \nCourt\u2019s decision in Foman, and they emphasize that \nthe Second Circuit\u2019s precedents have done the same.  \nBut Foman is categorically inapt, and the Second \nCircuit\u2019s reliance on it was the very legal error that \ncaused it to split with every other Circuit and violate \nthis Court\u2019s relevant precedents.   \nCritically, the Foman decision did not address a \nRule 60(b)(6) motion.  This court instead recognized \nthe motion \u201cas one under Rule 59(e).\u201d  371 U.S. at 181.  \nAs a result, Foman is simply irrelevant to this case.  \n\n9 \nRather, the controlling precedent is this Court\u2019s \ndecision in Gonzalez v. Crosby, which held that a Rule \n60(b)(6) motion \u201crequires a showing of \u2018extraordinary \ncircumstances.\u2019\u201d  545 U.S. at 536.  Respondents and \nthe Second Circuit thus have the analysis backwards. \nIndeed, \nin \nBanister \nv. \nDavis, \nthis \nCourt \nemphasized the critical distinctions between Rule \n59(e) and Rule 60(b).  A Rule 59(e) motion \u201cis a one-\ntime effort to bring alleged errors in a just-issued \ndecision to a [district] court\u2019s attention, before taking \na single appeal.\u201d  590 U.S. at 521.  Accordingly, the \ntime for bringing a Rule 59(e) motion \u201cis short\u201428 \ndays from entry of the judgment, with no possibility of \nan extension.\u201d  Id.  And, because \u201c[i]t is a limited \ncontinuation of the original proceeding,\u201d a Rule 59(e) \nmotion \u201c\u2018suspend[s] the finality\u2019 of any judgment.\u201d  Id. \nat 514 (cleaned up).  By contrast, \u201c[a] Rule 60(b) \nmotion\u2014often distant in time and scope and always \ngiving rise to a separate appeal\u2014attacks an already \ncompleted judgment.\u201d  Id. at 520-21.  Rather than \n\u201caid[ing] the trial court to get its decision right in the \nfirst instance,\u201d a Rule 60(b) motion \u201cserve[s] to \ncollaterally attack [an] already completed judgment.\u201d  \nId. at 518-19. It therefore uniquely \u201cthreaten[s] an \nalready final judgment with successive litigation.\u201d  Id.\nAnd for that reason, the \u201cstandard for granting a Rule \n59(e) motion\u201d is more \u201cbroad and open ended\u201d than \nRule 60(b)(6)\u2019s strict standard for relief.  Daulatzai, 97 \nF.4th at 177.  In short, \u201cRule 60(b) differs from Rule \n59(e) in just about every way that matters to the \ninquiry here.\u201d  Banister, 590 U.S. at 518; see \nDaulatzai, 97 F.4th at 177-78.   \n\n10 \nThe Second Circuit\u2019s approach fails to grasp these \ncrucial differences.  Instead, it wrongly treats Rule \n59(e) and Rule 60(b)(6) motions as fungible, and then \nrelies on Foman\u2019s more forgiving Rule 59(e) standard \nto override the strict requirements of Rule 60(b)(6) set \nforth in Gonzalez.  Thus, Respondents\u2019 effort to chide \nBLOM for not citing Foman only confirms that their \napproach\u2014which the Second Circuit adopted\u2014\nobliterates the critical distinction between Rule 59(e) \nand Rule 60(b)(6).  No other Circuit has adopted that \ncategory error.  To the contrary, they have all rejected \nit.  And the Fourth Circuit\u2019s recent decision in \nDaulatzai thoroughly debunks it.   \nMoreover, even if Foman somehow applied, the \nDistrict Court\u2019s denial of Respondents\u2019 motion clearly \nsatisfied its requirements.  In Foman, this Court held \nonly that \u201coutright refusal to grant [plaintiffs] leave \n[to amend] without any justifying reason\u201d is an abuse \nof discretion.  371 U.S. at 182.  Here, the District Court \nprovided multiple reasons for its denial.  For starters, \nRespondents \u201chad ample opportunity to pursue all \nlegal avenues available to them for relief,\u201d yet they \nengaged in a \u201cseries of deliberate choices not to cure \nthe \ndeficiencies \nidentified \nin \ntheir \npleading.\u201d  \nPet.App.16; Pet.App.19.  In addition, the District \nCourt dismissed their complaint with prejudice, and \nthat decision was affirmed based on one of the grounds \nidentified by the District Court.  Pet.App.13; \nPet.App.15 n.3.  During the appeal, Respondents \nnever challenged the District Court\u2019s decision to \ndismiss with prejudice, and they never requested leave \nto \namend\u2014even \nduring \nsupplemental \nbriefing \nfollowing the Second Circuit\u2019s intervening decision in \nKaplan.  Pet.10-11.  And, even to the extent the \n\n11 \nSecond Circuit \u201cclarifi[ed]\u201d the law in its decision, the \nDistrict Court explained that \u201ca mere change in \ndecisional law does not constitute an \u2018extraordinary \ncircumstance\u2019 for the purposes of Rule 60(b)(6).\u201d  \nPet.App.14 (citation omitted); accord Agostini v. \nFelton, 521 U.S. 203, 239 (1997) (\u201cIntervening \ndevelopments in the law by themselves rarely \nconstitute the extraordinary circumstances required \nfor relief under Rule 60(b)(6)[.]\u201d). \nIII. This \nCase \nDoes \nNot \nArise \nIn \nAn \nInterlocutory Posture. \nFaced with an undeniable circuit split and patently \nincorrect decision, Respondents attempt to label the \ndecision below \u201cinterlocutory\u201d to suggest that this case \npresents a \u201cpoor vehicle\u201d for review.  BIO.1; BIO.18-\n19; BIO.28.  But that is wrong as well.  Far from being \ninterlocutory, there is undeniably a final judgment in \nthis action.  See Honickman v. BLOM Bank SAL, 432 \nF. Supp. 3d 253 (E.D.N.Y. 2020), aff\u2019d, 6 F.4th 487 (2d \nCir. 2021).  Indeed, this appeal exists only because \nRespondents have sought to vacate that final \njudgment.  Respondents also ignore that an order \ndenying a Rule 60(b) motion is \u201cappealed as \u2018a \nseparate final order.\u2019\u201d  Banister, 590 U.S. at 520 \n(quoting Stone v. INS, 514 U.S. 386, 401 (1995)).  And \nthey do not dispute that reversing the Second Circuit\u2019s \ndecision would finally end this case for good.  There is \nthus nothing interlocutory about this appeal. \nWhat Respondents seem to really mean is that \nBLOM may still win yet again on remand.  On that \nbasis, Respondents suggest that review now may be \nunnecessary and inefficient.  BIO.18.  But that \nassertion is indicative of Respondents\u2019 abusive \n\n12 \nattitude toward the Federal Rules.  After Respondents \ndeclined multiple opportunities to amend their \ncomplaint, BLOM secured dismissal with prejudice.  \nRather than move at that time to amend under Rule \n59(e), Respondents chose to appeal.  Even during \nsupplemental briefing on appeal, Respondents never \nasked the Second Circuit to remand so they could \nreplead.  And when the Second Circuit affirmed, \nRespondents did not seek rehearing.  Instead, they \nfiled a Rule 60(b)(6) motion that sought to start the \nprocess all over again\u2014on the sole basis that they \nwished to plead new facts (of which they were \npreviously aware) in light of the Second Circuit\u2019s \ndecision.  Applying this Court\u2019s standards under Rule \n60(b)(6), the District Court properly denied the \nmotion.  Had the Second Circuit similarly applied Rule \n60(b)(6)\u2014or had this case arisen in any other \nCircuit\u2014this loop of relitigation would already be \nover.   \nRather than allow this inefficient distortion of the \nFederal Rules to continue, this Court should grant \nreview and restore uniformity in the law. \nCONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, and those set forth in \nBLOM\u2019s Petition, certiorari should be granted. \n\n13 \nRespectfully submitted, \nJONATHAN R.

As the Opening Brief \nexplained, that outlier approach lacks any basis in \nRule 60(b)(6)\u2019s text or context.  It puts Rule 60(b) at \nwar with itself on multiple fronts.  It subverts the \nguiding principles of the Federal Rules of Civil \nProcedure.  And it contradicts this Court\u2019s precedents.   \nThose decisions confirm that Rule 60(b)(6) \u201cis \navailable only when Rules 60(b)(1) through (b)(5) are \ninapplicable.\u201d  Kemp v. United States, 596 U.S. 528, \n533 (2022).  \u201cEven then, \u2018extraordinary circumstances\u2019 \nmust justify [the] reopening\u201d of a final judgment.  Id. \n(quoting Liljeberg v. Health Servs. Acquisition Corp., \n486 U.S. 847, 863 n.11 (1988)).  And a party\u2019s \u201cfree, \ncalculated, deliberate choices are not to be relieved \nfrom.\u201d  Ackermann v. United States, 340 U.S. 193, 198 \n(1950).  Rather, the party must be wholly \u201cfaultless in \nthe delay.\u201d  Pioneer Inv. Servs. Co. v. Brunswick \nAssocs. Ltd. P\u2019ship, 507 U.S. 380, 393 (1993). \nRespondents largely ignore these foundational \nprinciples.  That is because they cannot salvage the \nSecond Circuit\u2019s backwards approach or the mess it \nwould make of Rule 60(b) and the Federal Rules more \nbroadly.  Instead, Respondents try to avoid the Second \nCircuit\u2019s analysis, insisting that the court did not \nactually \u201c\u2018jettison\u2019 the extraordinary circumstances \nstandard\u201d and, in fact, \u201cd[id] not \u2018hold\u2019 anything.\u201d  \nResp.Br.22, 25 (citation omitted). \nThey are wrong on both points.  The Second Circuit \nexpressly abandoned the extraordinary circumstances \nstandard, and it held that the District Court erred by \napplying it.  In doing so, the Second Circuit \n\n2 \n \nacknowledged that a \u201cplaintiff is ordinarily entitled to \nRule 60(b)(6) relief \u2018only when there are extraordinary \ncircumstances justifying relief.\u2019\u201d  Pet.App.7 (emphasis \nadded; citation omitted).  \u201cBut,\u201d according to the \nSecond Circuit, the standard changes when \u201c\u2018vacatur \nis sought in order to obtain leave to file an amended \ncomplaint.\u2019\u201d  Pet.App.7 (quoting Mandala v. NTT \nData, Inc., 88 F.4th 353, 361 (2d Cir. 2023)).  In that \ncase, the Second Circuit believed that \u201c\u2018special \nconsiderations come into play\u2019\u201d that \u201crequire[] [district \ncourts] to consider Rule 60(b) finality and Rule 15(a) \nliberality in tandem.\u201d  Id. (quoting Mandala, 88 F.4th \nat 361).  Based on that mistaken view of the Federal \nRules, the Second Circuit held that the District Court \nabused its discretion by evaluating Respondents\u2019 Rule \n60(b) motion \u201cunder only Rule 60(b)\u2019s standard.\u201d  Id. \nThis Court should reverse and hold that the \nDistrict Court acted well within its discretion when it \napplied Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s high bar to deny relief.  Indeed, \nRespondents\u2019 \nsuggestion \nthat \nextraordinary \ncircumstances exist here only underscores the \nproblems with the Second Circuit\u2019s test.  Everything \nthey point to sounds in \u201cmistake, inadvertence, \nsurprise, or excusable neglect.\u201d  Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(1).  \nAs a result, Rule 60(b)(6) relief is categorically \nunavailable to them.  Rule 60(b)(1)\u2019s one-year deadline \ninstead applies\u2014and it expired before Respondents \nfiled their motion. \nRespondents\u2019 repeated and deliberate waivers also \nforeclose post-judgment relief.  They do not dispute \n\u201cthat they twice declined the opportunity to amend \ntheir Complaint before [the District] Court dismissed \nit,\u201d only to then \u201cwaive[]\u201d any challenge to the \u201c\u2018with \n\n3 \n \nprejudice\u2019 aspect of the dismissal\u201d on appeal.  \nPet.App.16 & n.4.  Nor do they dispute that it would \nhave been \u201can abuse of discretion\u201d for the lower courts \nto \u201coverride a [litigant\u2019s] deliberate waiver.\u201d  Wood v. \nMilyard, 566 U.S. 463, 472-73 (2012) (citation \nomitted).  That should be the end of the matter.  \nRespondents chose to stand or fall on their complaint \nas pled and unequivocally stated that they \u201cwould not \nseek leave to amend.\u201d  Pet.App.94.   \nRespondents gloss over these facts by claiming that \n\u201cthe Second Circuit did not find any waiver.\u201d  \nResp.Br.23.  But the District Court did, and the Second \nCircuit nowhere disagreed.  It nonetheless refused to \nuphold the District Court\u2019s decision\u2014notwithstanding \nthe waivers\u2014because the District Court had not given \n\u201cdue regard\u201d to \u201cthe liberal amendment policy of Rule \n15(a).\u201d  Pet.App.7 (quoting Mandala, 88 F.4th at 361).  \nThat was error.  Respondents \u201ccannot be relieved\u201d of \ntheir litigation choices merely \u201cbecause hindsight \nseems to indicate\u201d that those decisions were ill-\nadvised.  Ackermann, 340 U.S. at 199.  Thus, Rule \n60(b)(6) \u201chas no application to [this] situation.\u201d  Id. at \n202.  And, because a final judgment is in place, neither \ndoes Rule 15(a). \nThis Court should reverse the decision below, \nreinstate the District Court\u2019s denial of Respondents\u2019 \nRule 60(b) motion, and bring this case to an end. \n\n4 \n \nARGUMENT \nI. A Party Seeking To Vacate A Final Judgment \nFor Purposes Of Amendment Must Satisfy \nRule 60(b)\u2019s Stringent Standards. \nThe Second Circuit\u2019s balancing test dilutes Rule \n60(b)\u2019s exacting requirements for post-judgment relief \nwithout any basis in text, context, or precedent.  \nRespondents ignore the glaring problems with that \napproach.  And their arguments only highlight the \nflaws in the decision below. \nA. Rule 60(b)(6) Requires \u201cExtraordinary \nCircumstances\u201d Not Covered by Any Other \nProvision of Rule 60(b). \nRespondents\u2019 Rule 60(b)(6) motion should have \nbeen analyzed under Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s standard.  This \nCourt has consistently \u201crequired a movant seeking \nrelief under Rule 60(b)(6) to show \u2018extraordinary \ncircumstances\u2019 justifying the reopening of a final \njudgment.\u201d  Gonzalez v. Crosby, 545 U.S. 524, 535 \n(2005) (quoting Ackermann, 340 U.S. at 199); see \nPet.Br.23 (collecting cases).  This Court has also long \nstressed that Rule 60(b)(6) is \u201cmutually exclusive\u201d \nwith the other grounds for relief in Rule 60(b).  \nLiljeberg, 486 U.S. at 863 n.11.  The Rule\u2019s text and \nstructure dictate both of these principles.  See \nPet.Br.23, 27-28, 31-34.  Yet the decision below flouts \nthem.  And Respondents provide no basis to discard \nthese basic requirements where plaintiffs seek to \nrevive their case with an amended complaint. \nPerhaps recognizing the Second Circuit\u2019s misstep, \nRespondents start off by suggesting that the court did \nnot \u201cabandon[] the \u2018extraordinary circumstances\u2019 \n\n5 \n \nstandard in favor of a nebulous \u2018balanc[ing]\u2019 inquiry.\u201d  \nResp.Br.24 (citation omitted).  But that is wrong.  The \ndecision below rebuked the \u201cordinar[y]\u201d Rule 60(b)(6) \nstandard for one that \u201cbalance[s] Rule 60(b)\u2019s finality \nprinciples \nand \nRule \n15(a)\u2019s \nliberal \npleading \nprinciples.\u201d  Pet.App.7; see also Pet.App.8 (holding \nthat the District Court\u2019s extraordinary circumstances \n\u201cframework for analyzing [Respondents\u2019] motion was \nerroneous as a matter of law\u201d). \nThat analytical mistake was compelled by Second \nCircuit \nprecedent. \n \nIn \nMandala, \nthe \ncourt \nacknowledged the \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d test.  \n88 F.4th at 361.  But then it cast that standard aside \nto hold that, when a plaintiff seeks to amend, a district \ncourt abuses its discretion by \u201cdenying post-judgment \nrelief\u201d based solely on the movant\u2019s \u201cfailure to \ndemonstrate adequate grounds for relief under Rule \n60.\u201d  Id. at 362 & n.5.  That makes no sense.  As Judge \nSullivan countered in his Mandala dissent, \u201cit is \nbeyond cavil that a party\u2019s failure to demonstrate \nextraordinary circumstances is alone a sufficient \njustification for denying postjudgment relief under \nRule 60(b)(6).\u201d  Id. at 369 n.2 (Sullivan, J., dissenting).  \nThat is, after all, the standard for Rule 60(b)(6) relief.  \nAnd it is the standard that should have applied here. \nRespondents then later pull an about face, \nacknowledging that the Second Circuit did apply a \n\u201cbalancing test\u201d that imports \u201cthe policies embodied in \nRule 15(a)\u201d into the vacatur analysis.  Resp.Br.25 \n(quotation marks omitted).  But they offer no \npersuasive defense of that misguided approach. \n\n6 \n \n1. The Second Circuit\u2019s Balancing Test \nLacks Any Precedential Support. \nRespondents cannot ground the Second Circuit\u2019s \nbalancing test in the text or context of Rule 60(b)(6).  \nAccordingly, \nthey \nspend \nover \na \ndozen \npages \nmeandering through caselaw (at 25-38) in an effort to \ndownplay the novelty of that outlier position.  But they \nconcede that other decisions are \u201cout of step\u201d with the \nSecond Circuit\u2019s interpretation.  Resp.Br.33.  And \nRespondents do not rely on any case that helps them. \nRespondents fumble (at 27) for support in Krupski \nv. Costa Crociere S. p. A., 560 U.S. 538 (2010).  But \nthat case addressed the scope of \u201crelation back under \nRule 15(c)(1)(C),\u201d as defined by \u201cthe text of the Rule.\u201d  \nId. at 541, 547.  Krupski said nothing about the proper \nstandard for reopening a judgment under Rule 60(b).  \nThat is the Rule that governs \u201cRelief from a Final \nJudgment, Order, or Proceeding.\u201d  Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b). \nRespondents also double down (at 26-27) on Foman \nv. Davis, 371 U.S. 178 (1962).  But they concede that \ncase involved a motion \u201cunder Rule 59(e), not Rule \n60(b).\u201d  Resp.Br.27 n.3.  As explained in the Opening \nBrief, that distinction matters.  See Pet.Br.34-35.  And \nwhile Respondents try to characterize the specific rule \nin Foman as \u201ccompletely irrelevant to this Court\u2019s \nanalysis,\u201d Resp.Br.27 n.3, that is not true.  The proper \nstandard for a Rule 60(b) motion was not before the \nFoman Court, and Rule 59(e) and Rule 60(b) impose \n\u201cdifferent standards\u201d for relief \u201cby their own terms.\u201d  \nDaulatzai v. Maryland, 97 F.4th 166, 177 (4th Cir. \n2024).  Hence, the Rule 59(e) motion in Foman was \n\u201cnot controlled by the same exacting substantive \nrequirements\u201d codified in Rule 60(b)\u2019s text.  Priester v. \n\n7 \n \nJP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., 927 F.3d 912, 913 (5th \nCir. 2019) (quotation marks omitted).   \nNor is it surprising that the standards would differ \nbetween the two rules.  They serve markedly different \nfunctions.  A Rule 59(e) motion operates as \u201ca limited \ncontinuation of the original proceeding\u201d and plays \u201ca \npart [in] producing the final judgment,\u201d whereas a \nRule 60(b) motion \u201cthreaten[s] an already final \njudgment with successive litigation.\u201d  Banister v. \nDavis, 590 U.S. 504, 519, 521 (2020); see Pet.Br.34-35.  \nRule 60(b) thus naturally poses a higher bar for relief. \nRespondents next trumpet (at 29-31, 33, 35-38) a \nparade of lower court decisions.  But those cases, \nobviously, do not control this Court\u2019s analysis.  And \nmost of them similarly addressed Rule 59(e) motions, \nnot Rule 60(b) motions.1  So, they are simply off-point \nas well.  Rules 59(e) and 60(b) are not fungible, and \nRespondents fail to offer any reason to merge the two \ntextually and functionally distinct rules into one. \nNor do any of the few 60(b) cases that Respondents \nlean on (at 29-30) provide them any support.  Those \ndecisions merely recognize that the Rules\u2019 drafters \nalready balanced the needs for \u201cfinality\u201d and \u201cjustice\u201d \n \n1  See, e.g., Runnion ex rel. Runnion v. Girl Scouts of Greater Chi. \n& Nw. Ind., 786 F.3d 510, 523 (7th Cir. 2015); NewSpin Sports, \nLLC v. Arrow Elecs., Inc., 910 F.3d 293, 299 (7th Cir. 2018); \nUnited States ex rel. Customs Fraud Investigations, LLC v. \nVictaulic Co., 839 F.3d 242, 248-49 (3d Cir. 2016); Jang v. Bos. \nSci. Scimed, Inc., 729 F.3d 357, 368 (3d Cir. 2013); Rosenzweig v. \nAzurix Corp., 332 F.3d 854, 863-64 (5th Cir. 2003); Firestone v. \nFirestone, 76 F.3d 1205, 1208 (D.C. Cir. 1996); S. Constructors \nGrp. v. Dynalectric Co., 2 F.3d 606, 611 (5th Cir. 1993); see also \nAllen v. Walmart Stores, L.L.C., 907 F.3d 170, 184 (5th Cir. 2018). \n\n8 \n \nin Rule 60(b) itself.  Phelps v. Alameida, 569 F.3d 1120, \n1133 (9th Cir. 2009) (citation omitted).  None suggests \nthat courts should then smuggle in Rule 15(a)\u2019s liberal \nrepleading principles as an additional variable to tip \nthe scales against finality under Rule 60(b).  The \nSecond Circuit stands alone by imposing that \nextratextual requirement.2 \nRespondents also rely heavily on United States v. \nMask of Ka-Nefer-Nefer, 752 F.3d 737 (8th Cir. 2014).  \nBut that was a Rule 60(b)(1) case, not a Rule 60(b)(6) \ncase.  See id. at 743.  And it only further illustrates \nwhy Respondents are wrong here.  Like every other \nCourt of Appeals, see Pet.Br.21 n.3, the Eighth Circuit \nthere held that courts may grant leave to amend only \nif doing so \u201cis consistent with the stringent standards \ngoverning the grant of . . . Rule 60(b) relief,\u201d 752 F.3d \n \n2  Other decisions cited by Respondents do not address either \nRule 59(e) or Rule 60(b) motions.  See, e.g., Gondeck v. Pan Am. \nWorld Airways, Inc., 382 U.S. 25, 26-28 (1965); Jack v. Evonik \nCorp., 79 F.4th 547, 565 (5th Cir. 2023); Tate v. SCR Med. \nTransp., 809 F.3d 343, 346 (7th Cir. 2015); Calvary Christian Ctr. \nv. City of Fredericksburg, 710 F.3d 536, 539-41 (4th Cir. 2013); \nUnited States ex rel. Lee v. Corinthian Colls., 655 F.3d 984, 998 \n(9th Cir. 2011); Dubicz v. Commonwealth Edison Co., 377 F.3d \n787, 790-91 (7th Cir. 2004); Duggins v. Steak \u2019n Shake, Inc., 195 \nF.3d 828, 834 (6th Cir. 1999); Moore v. City of Paducah, 790 F.2d \n557, 559-60 (6th Cir. 1986); Oil, Chem. & Atomic Workers Int\u2019l \nUnion, AFL-CIO v. Delta Refin. Co., 277 F.2d 694, 697 (6th Cir. \n1960); Marranzano v. Riggs Nat\u2019l Bank, 184 F.2d 349, 351 (D.C. \nCir. 1950).  Nor do any of them deal with circumstances like \nthese, in which Respondents engaged in a \u201cdocumented series of \ndeliberate choices not to cure the deficiencies identified in their \npleading\u201d prior to dismissal.  Pet.App.19; cf. Foster v. DeLuca, 545 \nF.3d 582, 584 (7th Cir. 2008) (no waiver by plaintiff, who filed a \ncombined Rule 59(e) and 60(b) motion just a week after the \ndistrict court terminated the case without warning). \n\n9 \n \nat 743.  It then affirmed the district court\u2019s denial of \npost-judgment relief where, as here, the plaintiff \n\u201cknew many months prior to the Order of Dismissal of \nthe possible need to amend its pleading and elected to \n\u2018stand or fall\u2019\u201d on its complaint.  Id. at 744; see \nPet.App.15-18.  The Second Circuit should have \nreached the same result. \nFinally, Respondents cobble together (at 37) a trio \nof this Court\u2019s precedents that have nothing to do with \nthe question presented in this case.  None even \nmentions Rule 60(b), let alone purports to analyze the \nproper standard for a plaintiff seeking relief from a \nfinal judgment.  Nor did they have occasion to do so.  \nIn Tellabs, Inc. v. Makor Issues & Rights, Ltd., 551 \nU.S. 308, 329 (2007), this Court merely remanded for \napplication of a legal standard to the facts alleged.  In \nAshcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 666 (2009), this Court \nconfronted an \u201cinterlocutory appeal,\u201d not an appeal \nfrom a final judgment.  And in Johnson v. City of \nShelby, 574 U.S. 10, 12 (2014), this Court \u201creversed\u201d \nan improper dismissal, meaning there was no longer a \nfinal judgment on remand. \nHere, by contrast, Respondents seek to set aside a \ndismissal with prejudice that was affirmed on appeal.  \nPet.App.49-53.  A final judgment remains in place.  \nThus, Respondents must \u201csatisfy one of the Rule 60(b) \ngrounds before [the] court may consider [a] motion to \namend.\u201d  Daulatzai, 97 F.4th at 178.  \u201cThe permissive \npolicy favoring amendment under Rule 15 [is] simply \nnot relevant\u201d until they make that showing.  Garrett \nv. Wexford Health, 938 F.3d 69, 86 (3d Cir. 2019).  The \nSecond Circuit erred in holding to the contrary. \n\n10 \n \n2. Respondents\u2019 Other Arguments Are \nMeritless. \nBeyond citing inapposite precedents, Respondents \nsay little else to defend the decision below.  They do \nnot suggest that the Second Circuit\u2019s outlier approach \nfinds any support in Rule 60(b)\u2019s text.  They do not rely \non the Rule\u2019s history or structure.  They do not dispute \nthat the decision below thwarts the \u201cspeedy\u201d and \n\u201cinexpensive\u201d resolution of claims.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 1.  \nAnd they do not explain how it is \u201cjust\u201d to relieve \nplaintiffs from their own litigation choices\u2014which \nwould burden both defendants and the courts with \nduplicative litigation.  Id.; see Pet.Br.37; Mandala, 88 \nF.4th at 369 (Sullivan, J., dissenting). \nNor do Respondents grapple with the many ways \nin which the Second Circuit\u2019s balancing test clashes \nwith other provisions of Rule 60(b).  See Pet.Br.31-34.  \nThey do not dispute that it enables plaintiffs to evade \nRule 60\u2019s strict time limitations where allegations are \nomitted by \u201cexcusable neglect.\u201d  Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(1), \n(c)(1).  Nor do they explain why plaintiffs could wield \nRule 60(b)(6) to introduce previously available facts \nyears after judgment, when Rule 60 elsewhere limits \nrelief to matters \u201cnewly discovered\u201d within a year of \njudgment that \u201ccould not have been discovered\u201d before \nwith \u201creasonable diligence.\u201d  Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(2).  \nThe Second Circuit\u2019s test invites that internal \ninconsistency.  See Mandala, 88 F.4th at 365 (ordering \nvacatur and amendment \u201cbased on information that \nwas publicly available for years prior to the filing of \nthe Complaint\u201d). \nAs to mistake, Respondents claim that \u201cthe Second \nCircuit has never suggested that vacatur and \n\n11 \n \namendment are permissible where a complaint failed \ndue to counsel\u2019s mistake.\u201d  Resp.Br.43.  But, even \nsetting aside the fact that Rule 60(b)(1) is not limited \nto counsel\u2019s mistakes, see Kemp, 596 U.S. at 534-35, \nthe Second Circuit has required just that.  It deployed \nits balancing test in Mandala to compel the reopening \nof a final judgment, even though the \u201cvacatur motion \nar[ose] from a legal mistake based on insufficient \npleading.\u201d  88 F.4th at 360.  That is precisely \nRespondents\u2019 theory here too\u2014that they made a legal \nmistake as to which facts they needed to allege to \nsatisfy JASTA\u2019s statutory standard.  See Resp.Br.45.3 \nRetreating from Rule 60(b), Respondents note that \nRule 15 \u201ccontemplates two stages of amendment\u2014\nbefore trial and during or after trial.\u201d  Resp.Br.42.  Yet, \nthey fail to explain why that might bear on the \nthreshold vacatur inquiry, which necessarily occurs in \nthe post-judgment context.  At that point, \u201c[t]he suit is \nover.\u201d  Pe\u00f1a v. Mattox, 84 F.3d 894, 903 (7th Cir. 1996).  \n\u201cThere is no complaint to amend.\u201d  Id.  And \nRespondents concede \u201cthat Rule 15(a) \u2018does not \nprovide a mechanism for amending pleadings after \ndismissal.\u2019\u201d  Resp.Br.42 (quoting Pet.Br.30).  Rather, \nRule 60(b) defines the \u201climited set of circumstances\u201d \nthat might allow the losing party to \u201crequest \nreopening of his case.\u201d  Gonzalez, 545 U.S. at 528.  \n \n3  To be clear, Respondents\u2019 proposed amendments still \n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n1: 20250207164739436_23-125920Affidavit.json (score: 0.531)\nAFFIDAVIT OF SERVICE \n \nSUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES \n \nNo. 23-1259 \n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------X \n \nBLOM BANK SAL, \n \nPetitioner, \n \nv. \n \nMICHAL HONICKMAN, et al., \n \nRespondents, \n \n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------X \n \nSTATE OF NEW YORK  \n) \n  \n                   \nCOUNTY OF NEW YORK \n) \n \nI, Ann Tosel, being duly sworn according to law and being over the age \nof 18, upon my oath depose and say that: \n \nI am retained by Counsel of Record for Petitioner. \n \nThat on the 7th day of February, 2025, I served the within Reply Brief \nfor Petitioner in the above-captioned matter upon: \n \nMichael Jacob Radine \nOsen LLC \n190 Moore Street, Suite 272 \nHackensack, NJ 07601 \n201-265-6400 \nmradine@osenlaw.com \nCounsel for Respondents \n \nby sending three copies of same, addressed to each individual respectively, \nthrough Overnight FedEx.

Respondents do not seriously \ndispute that the Second Circuit\u2019s dilution of Rule \n60(b)\u2019s stringent standard places it on the short end of \na lopsided circuit split.  In fact, Respondents entirely \nignore the conflicting decisions of several Courts of \nAppeals.  And they get no further with their efforts to \ndistinguish a few bricks in the wall of precedents from \nevery other Circuit that has rejected the Second \nCircuit\u2019s outlier approach.  Those decisions make clear \nthat the Second Circuit is now \u201calone in the Nation in \ncollapsing the Rule 60(b) standard with the standard \nfor Rule 15(a).\u201d  Daulatzai v. Maryland, 97 F.4th 166, \n177 (4th Cir. 2024). \nRespondents similarly do not dispute that, \u201c[t]o \njustify relief under [Rule 60(b)(6)], a party must show \n\u2018extraordinary circumstances\u2019 suggesting that the \nparty is faultless.\u201d  Pioneer Inv. Servs. v. Brunswick \nAssocs. Ltd. P\u2019ship, 507 U.S. 380, 393 (1993).  Nor do \nthey dispute that, in this case, their repeated decisions \nnot to amend were \u201cfree, calculated, [and] deliberate.\u201d  \nAckermann v. United States, 340 U.S. 193, 198 (1950).  \nThat should foreclose the extraordinary relief \nRespondents seek here.  \nInstead, Respondents\u2019 primary response is to fault \nthe Petition for not discussing Foman v. Davis, 371 \nU.S. 178 (1962).  But there is a very good reason for \nthat:  Foman involved a Rule 59(e) motion, while this \ncase concerns a Rule 60(b) motion.  \u201cThe difference \nbetween the two rules . . . is material, both in scope \nand purpose, and, by their own terms, different \nstandards apply.\u201d  Daulatzai, 97 F.4th at 177.  Indeed, \n\n2 \nthis Court recently emphasized that very point in \nBanister v. Davis, 590 U.S. 504 (2020), when it refused \nto conflate the two Rules in the habeas context.  Thus, \nFoman\u2019s discussion of Rule 59(e) does not affect the \nRule 60(b)(6) analysis here.   \nInstead, the relevant precedent is this Court\u2019s \ndecision in Gonzalez v. Crosby, which held that a \n60(b)(6) motion \u201crequires a showing of \u2018extraordinary \ncircumstances.\u2019\u201d  545 U.S. 524, 536 (2005).  The Second \nCircuit\u2019s decisions squarely conflict with Gonzalez by \neschewing Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s stringent rule in favor of a \n\u201cliberal repleading policy.\u201d  Pet.App.8.  No other \nCircuit has adopted that misguided approach.   \nUnable to wash away the circuit split or the Second \nCircuit\u2019s disregard for this Court\u2019s precedent, \nRespondents try to ward off review by labeling this \ncase \u201cinterlocutory.\u201d  But that is patently incorrect.  \nThis appeal arises from Respondents\u2019 attempt to \nvacate a final judgment that was entered nearly five \nyears ago.  And the ruling denying that motion was \nitself a final order.  Relief from this Court would thus \nfinally end this case, while denying review would \nthwart the efficiency and finality principles that \nanimate the Federal Rules. \nIn the end, the Second Circuit\u2019s unprecedented \ndilution of Rule 60(b)(6) conflicts with this Court\u2019s \ndecisions and those of every other Circuit.  It threatens \nto undermine the finality of judgments.  It encourages \nwasteful litigation tactics.  And, as a matter of law, the \ndecision below is simply wrong.  This Court should \ngrant review and reverse.   \n\n3 \nARGUMENT \nI. \nThe Second Circuit\u2019s Approach Conflicts \nWith That Of Eleven Other Circuits.  \nRespondents concede the existence of a circuit split \nby failing to address the conflicting decisions \nPetitioner identified from the First, Third, Eighth, \nEleventh, and D.C. Circuits.  Although Respondents \ncherry-pick quotes from some of the others, a review \nof those decisions confirms an irreconcilable split \nbetween the Second Circuit\u2019s newly developed test for \nRule 60(b) motions and the correct test used in the rest \nof the Courts of Appeals. \nA. Respondents Concede that a Circuit Split \nExists.   \nRespondents \ncompletely \nignore \nthen-Judge \nBreyer\u2019s decision for the First Circuit in James v. \nWatt, 716 F.2d 71 (1983).  There, as here, the First \nCircuit confronted a district court\u2019s denial of a post-\njudgment motion to amend a dismissed complaint.  Id. \nat 77.  In affirming, then-Judge Breyer explained that \n\u201cto require the district court to permit amendment \nhere would allow plaintiffs to pursue a case to \njudgment and then, if they lose, to reopen the case by \namending their complaint to take account of the \ncourt\u2019s decision.\u201d  Id. at 78.  The First Circuit rebuked \nthat approach because it \u201cwould dramatically \nundermine the ordinary rules governing the finality of \njudicial decisions.\u201d  Id.  That reasoning flatly \ncontradicts the \u201cliberal amendment policy\u201d endorsed \nby the Second Circuit.  Pet.App.7.  But Respondents \ndo not even acknowledge the case. \n\n4 \nRespondents also ignore the Third Circuit\u2019s \ndecision in Garrett v. Wexford Health, 938 F.3d 69 (3d \nCir. 2019).  In Garrett, the Third Circuit explained \nthat, when a party seeks \u201cto reopen a final judgment, \nthe policy favoring the finality of judgments\u201d is \nimplicated, and \u201c[t]he permissive policy favoring \namendment under Rule 15 [is] simply not relevant.\u201d  \nId. at 86.  Accordingly, \u201c[i]n the post-judgment context, \nthe narrow grounds for relief set forth\u201d in Rule 60(b) \n\u201cmust guide a District Court\u2019s decision about whether \nan otherwise-final judgment should  be disturbed.\u201d  Id.\nThe Third Circuit therefore recognizes\u2014unlike the \nSecond Circuit\u2014that \u201ca different set of rules \nemphasizing vastly different policies\u201d pertain to a \nmotion seeking to vacate a final judgment for the \npurposes of amending a complaint.  Id.\nRespondents likewise ignore the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s \ndecision in MacPhee v. MiMedx Grp., Inc., 73 F.4th \n1220 (11th Cir. 2023).  As in this case, the district \ncourt there denied the plaintiff\u2019s motion for post-\njudgment vacatur-for-amendment, \u201cexplaining that \nbecause [the plaintiff] waited until after judgment was \nentered to seek such relief, Rule 15(a) did not apply.\u201d  \nId. at 1238.  Unless the plaintiff could first show \n\u201centitle[ment] to relief under Rule 59(e) or 60(b),\u201d it \n\u201cwas not entitled to leave to amend post-judgment.\u201d  \nId.  The Eleventh Circuit affirmed, embracing this \nrestrictive approach even \u201cwhere the plaintiff has not \nexercised its right under Rule 15(a)(1) to amend as a \nmatter of course.\u201d  Id. at 1250.  Again, that is directly \nat odds with the Second Circuit\u2019s belief that plaintiffs \nneed not \u201cnavigate Rule 60(b)\u2019s finality gauntlet before \nthey [can] invoke Rule 15(a)\u2019s liberal repleading \n\n5 \npolicy.\u201d  Pet.App.8.  And, again, Respondents \nconspicuously fail to address it.  \nThe same goes for UMB Bank, N.A. v. Guerin, 89 \nF.4th 1047 (8th Cir. 2024).  As the Eighth Circuit held \nthere, \u201cthe liberal amendment standard in Rule \n15(a)(2) does not govern\u201d for post-judgment motions \nseeking to amend a complaint.  Id. at 1057. Instead, \n\u201ca more restrictive standard reflecting interests of \nfinality applies.\u201d  Id. (citation omitted).  That is, \n\u201c[l]eave to amend will be granted if\u201d\u2014and only if\u2014\u201cit \nis consistent with the stringent standards governing \nthe grant of Rule 59(e) and Rule 60(b) relief.\u201d  Id.\n(cleaned up).  Respondents once again ignore this \ndecision, which squarely conflicts with the Second \nCircuit\u2019s requirement that district courts \u201cbalance \nRule 60(b)\u2019s finality principles and Rule 15(a)\u2019s liberal \npleading principles.\u201d  Pet.App.7; see also Mandala v. \nNTT Data, 88 F.4th 353, 361 (2d Cir. 2023).   \nRespondents similarly ignore the D.C. Circuit\u2019s \nholding that \u201cRule 60(b)(6) is not an opportunity for \nunsuccessful litigants to take a mulligan.\u201d  Kramer v. \nGates, 481 F.3d 788, 792 (D.C. Cir. 2007).  To be sure, \nRespondents obliquely note that the D.C. Circuit has \nallowed \npost-judgment \namendment \nin \n\u201ccertain \ncircumstances.\u201d  BIO.27.  But those are where the \nmovant has \u201cprevailed on the claim in question.\u201d  Bldg. \nIndus. Ass\u2019n v. Norton, 247 F.3d 1241, 1245 (D.C. Cir. \n2007) (emphasis added).  That is not the case here.  \nRespondents\u2019 claims were dismissed with prejudice, \nand that dismissal was affirmed on appeal.  \n\n6 \nIn short, by their own omissions, Respondents \nconcede the decision below conflicts with decisions \nfrom the First, Third, Eighth, Eleventh, and D.C. \nCircuits.  That alone should warrant review. \nB. Respondents\u2019 Discussion of Other Circuit \nDecisions \nConfirms \nthat \nthe \nSecond \nCircuit Has Adopted an Outlier Approach. \nThe circuit split extends far beyond the cases \nRespondents ignore.   \nMost notably, in Daulatzai, the Fourth Circuit \nspecifically rejected the Second Circuit\u2019s approach in a \nthoroughly reasoned opinion.   See 97 F.4th at 180.  \nThe Fourth Circuit affirmed the district court\u2019s denial \nof a Rule 60(b) motion.  In so doing, the Fourth Circuit \nconfronted the exact error that the Second Circuit \ncommitted in Mandala and this case.  It expressly \n\u201creject[ed] \nDaulatzai\u2019s \nargument\u201d \nthat \nearlier \nprecedents \u201ccollapsing . . . the standards under Rule \n59(e) and Rule 15(a) should also apply when the \nmotion seeks relief from the judgment under Rule \n60(b).\u201d  Id. at 179 (emphases added).  Thus, unlike the \nSecond Circuit, the Fourth Circuit has correctly held \nthat, \u201cwhen the motion to vacate is filed under Rule \n60(b), the more restrictive standard for granting that \nmotion must be satisfied before consideration can be \ngiven to the motion to amend.\u201d  Id. at 179 (emphasis \nadded).  By contrast, the Second Circuit here faulted \nthe District Court for \u201ctreat[ing] Plaintiffs\u2019 motion to \nvacate and amend as calling for two distinct analyses\u201d \nunder Rule 60(b) and then Rule 15(a).  Pet.App.7-8; see \n\n7 \nalso Mandala 88 F.4th at 361.  The two approaches \nare impossible to square.1\nRespondents only further underscore this error by \ntrying to leverage a pair of Second Circuit decisions \naddressing Rule 59(e) to suggest its approach is \nconsistent with the law of other Circuits.  See BIO.21-\n23 (discussing Metzler Investment Gmbh v. Chipotle \nMexican Grill, Inc., 970 F.3d 133 (2d Cir. 2020) and \nWilliams v. Citigroup Inc., 659 F.3d 208 (2d Cir. 2011) \n(per curiam)).  But whether those earlier cases are \nconsistent with other Circuits\u2019 Rule 59(e) cases does \nnot alter the fact that the Second Circuit\u2019s treatment \nof Rule 60(b) motions seeking to replead sharply \nconflicts with the decisions of every other Circuit \napplying Rule 60(b).  On that latter issue, which is the \nquestion presented here, the Second Circuit has \nabandoned the extraordinary-circumstances standard \nto require district courts \u201cto consider Rule 60(b) \nfinality and Rule 15(a) liberality in tandem.\u201d  \nPet.App.7.  In other words, it has forbade district \ncourts from analyzing Rule 60(b) motions \u201cunder only \nRule 60(b)\u2019s standard.\u201d  Id.   \nThat clashes with the otherwise unanimous view of \nthe Courts of Appeals, which have consistently held \nthat plaintiffs \u201cmust first meet the threshold \n1 Rather than confront the Fourth Circuit\u2019s thoughtful analysis \nin Daulatzai, Respondents suggest the Fourth Circuit must have \nbeen aware of the Second Circuit\u2019s decisions in Mandala and \nHonickman.  BIO.23.  But the Second Circuit issued its mistaken \nopinions after Daulatzai was argued on October 24, 2023.  And \nthe docket in Daulatzai reflects that neither party filed a Rule \n28(j) letter bringing either Mandala or this case to the Fourth \nCircuit\u2019s attention.  It is thus no surprise that the Fourth Circuit \ndid not mention the Second Circuit\u2019s erroneous decisions. \n\n8 \nrequirement of 60(b)(6)\u2019s extraordinary or exceptional \ncircumstances to vacate the judgment before\u201d \ninvoking Rule 15(a)\u2019s liberal amendment policy.  In re \nFerro Corp. Deriv. Litig., 511 F.3d 611, 624 (6th Cir. \n2008) (emphasis added); see also, e.g., Ewing v. 1645 \nW. Farragut LLC, 90 F.4th 876, 893 (7th Cir. 2024); \nNavajo Nation v. Dep\u2019t of the Interior, 876 F.3d 1144, \n1173 (9th Cir. 2017); Rosenzweig v. Azurix Corp., 332 \nF.3d 854, 864 (5th Cir. 2003); Cooper v. Shumway, 780 \nF.2d 27, 28 (10th Cir. 1985) (per curiam). \nThis Court should thus grant certiorari to remedy \nthe split and confirm that losing litigants may not \ndeploy the policies of Rule 15(a) to bypass Rule 60(b)\u2019s \nexacting requirements for relief. \nII. Respondents\u2019 Reliance On Foman Only \nReinforces The Fundament Flaws In The \nSecond Circuit\u2019s Approach.  \nNot only are Respondents\u2019 efforts to obscure the \ncircuit split unavailing, but their attempt to defend \nthe \ndecision \nbelow \nonly \nfurther \nreveals \nthe \nfundamental legal error in the Second Circuit\u2019s outlier \napproach.  Respondents rely principally on this \nCourt\u2019s decision in Foman, and they emphasize that \nthe Second Circuit\u2019s precedents have done the same.  \nBut Foman is categorically inapt, and the Second \nCircuit\u2019s reliance on it was the very legal error that \ncaused it to split with every other Circuit and violate \nthis Court\u2019s relevant precedents.   \nCritically, the Foman decision did not address a \nRule 60(b)(6) motion.  This court instead recognized \nthe motion \u201cas one under Rule 59(e).\u201d  371 U.S. at 181.  \nAs a result, Foman is simply irrelevant to this case.  \n\n9 \nRather, the controlling precedent is this Court\u2019s \ndecision in Gonzalez v. Crosby, which held that a Rule \n60(b)(6) motion \u201crequires a showing of \u2018extraordinary \ncircumstances.\u2019\u201d  545 U.S. at 536.  Respondents and \nthe Second Circuit thus have the analysis backwards. \nIndeed, \nin \nBanister \nv. \nDavis, \nthis \nCourt \nemphasized the critical distinctions between Rule \n59(e) and Rule 60(b).  A Rule 59(e) motion \u201cis a one-\ntime effort to bring alleged errors in a just-issued \ndecision to a [district] court\u2019s attention, before taking \na single appeal.\u201d  590 U.S. at 521.  Accordingly, the \ntime for bringing a Rule 59(e) motion \u201cis short\u201428 \ndays from entry of the judgment, with no possibility of \nan extension.\u201d  Id.  And, because \u201c[i]t is a limited \ncontinuation of the original proceeding,\u201d a Rule 59(e) \nmotion \u201c\u2018suspend[s] the finality\u2019 of any judgment.\u201d  Id. \nat 514 (cleaned up).  By contrast, \u201c[a] Rule 60(b) \nmotion\u2014often distant in time and scope and always \ngiving rise to a separate appeal\u2014attacks an already \ncompleted judgment.\u201d  Id. at 520-21.  Rather than \n\u201caid[ing] the trial court to get its decision right in the \nfirst instance,\u201d a Rule 60(b) motion \u201cserve[s] to \ncollaterally attack [an] already completed judgment.\u201d  \nId. at 518-19. It therefore uniquely \u201cthreaten[s] an \nalready final judgment with successive litigation.\u201d  Id.\nAnd for that reason, the \u201cstandard for granting a Rule \n59(e) motion\u201d is more \u201cbroad and open ended\u201d than \nRule 60(b)(6)\u2019s strict standard for relief.  Daulatzai, 97 \nF.4th at 177.  In short, \u201cRule 60(b) differs from Rule \n59(e) in just about every way that matters to the \ninquiry here.\u201d  Banister, 590 U.S. at 518; see \nDaulatzai, 97 F.4th at 177-78.   \n\n10 \nThe Second Circuit\u2019s approach fails to grasp these \ncrucial differences.  Instead, it wrongly treats Rule \n59(e) and Rule 60(b)(6) motions as fungible, and then \nrelies on Foman\u2019s more forgiving Rule 59(e) standard \nto override the strict requirements of Rule 60(b)(6) set \nforth in Gonzalez.  Thus, Respondents\u2019 effort to chide \nBLOM for not citing Foman only confirms that their \napproach\u2014which the Second Circuit adopted\u2014\nobliterates the critical distinction between Rule 59(e) \nand Rule 60(b)(6).  No other Circuit has adopted that \ncategory error.  To the contrary, they have all rejected \nit.  And the Fourth Circuit\u2019s recent decision in \nDaulatzai thoroughly debunks it.   \nMoreover, even if Foman somehow applied, the \nDistrict Court\u2019s denial of Respondents\u2019 motion clearly \nsatisfied its requirements.  In Foman, this Court held \nonly that \u201coutright refusal to grant [plaintiffs] leave \n[to amend] without any justifying reason\u201d is an abuse \nof discretion.  371 U.S. at 182.  Here, the District Court \nprovided multiple reasons for its denial.  For starters, \nRespondents \u201chad ample opportunity to pursue all \nlegal avenues available to them for relief,\u201d yet they \nengaged in a \u201cseries of deliberate choices not to cure \nthe \ndeficiencies \nidentified \nin \ntheir \npleading.\u201d  \nPet.App.16; Pet.App.19.  In addition, the District \nCourt dismissed their complaint with prejudice, and \nthat decision was affirmed based on one of the grounds \nidentified by the District Court.  Pet.App.13; \nPet.App.15 n.3.  During the appeal, Respondents \nnever challenged the District Court\u2019s decision to \ndismiss with prejudice, and they never requested leave \nto \namend\u2014even \nduring \nsupplemental \nbriefing \nfollowing the Second Circuit\u2019s intervening decision in \nKaplan.  Pet.10-11.  And, even to the extent the \n\n11 \nSecond Circuit \u201cclarifi[ed]\u201d the law in its decision, the \nDistrict Court explained that \u201ca mere change in \ndecisional law does not constitute an \u2018extraordinary \ncircumstance\u2019 for the purposes of Rule 60(b)(6).\u201d  \nPet.App.14 (citation omitted); accord Agostini v. \nFelton, 521 U.S. 203, 239 (1997) (\u201cIntervening \ndevelopments in the law by themselves rarely \nconstitute the extraordinary circumstances required \nfor relief under Rule 60(b)(6)[.]\u201d). \nIII. This \nCase \nDoes \nNot \nArise \nIn \nAn \nInterlocutory Posture. \nFaced with an undeniable circuit split and patently \nincorrect decision, Respondents attempt to label the \ndecision below \u201cinterlocutory\u201d to suggest that this case \npresents a \u201cpoor vehicle\u201d for review.  BIO.1; BIO.18-\n19; BIO.28.  But that is wrong as well.  Far from being \ninterlocutory, there is undeniably a final judgment in \nthis action.  See Honickman v. BLOM Bank SAL, 432 \nF. Supp. 3d 253 (E.D.N.Y. 2020), aff\u2019d, 6 F.4th 487 (2d \nCir. 2021).  Indeed, this appeal exists only because \nRespondents have sought to vacate that final \njudgment.  Respondents also ignore that an order \ndenying a Rule 60(b) motion is \u201cappealed as \u2018a \nseparate final order.\u2019\u201d  Banister, 590 U.S. at 520 \n(quoting Stone v. INS, 514 U.S. 386, 401 (1995)).  And \nthey do not dispute that reversing the Second Circuit\u2019s \ndecision would finally end this case for good.  There is \nthus nothing interlocutory about this appeal. \nWhat Respondents seem to really mean is that \nBLOM may still win yet again on remand.  On that \nbasis, Respondents suggest that review now may be \nunnecessary and inefficient.  BIO.18.  But that \nassertion is indicative of Respondents\u2019 abusive \n\n12 \nattitude toward the Federal Rules.  After Respondents \ndeclined multiple opportunities to amend their \ncomplaint, BLOM secured dismissal with prejudice.  \nRather than move at that time to amend under Rule \n59(e), Respondents chose to appeal.  Even during \nsupplemental briefing on appeal, Respondents never \nasked the Second Circuit to remand so they could \nreplead.  And when the Second Circuit affirmed, \nRespondents did not seek rehearing.  Instead, they \nfiled a Rule 60(b)(6) motion that sought to start the \nprocess all over again\u2014on the sole basis that they \nwished to plead new facts (of which they were \npreviously aware) in light of the Second Circuit\u2019s \ndecision.  Applying this Court\u2019s standards under Rule \n60(b)(6), the District Court properly denied the \nmotion.  Had the Second Circuit similarly applied Rule \n60(b)(6)\u2014or had this case arisen in any other \nCircuit\u2014this loop of relitigation would already be \nover.   \nRather than allow this inefficient distortion of the \nFederal Rules to continue, this Court should grant \nreview and restore uniformity in the law. \nCONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, and those set forth in \nBLOM\u2019s Petition, certiorari should be granted. \n\n13 \nRespectfully submitted, \nJONATHAN R.

As the Opening Brief \nexplained, that outlier approach lacks any basis in \nRule 60(b)(6)\u2019s text or context.  It puts Rule 60(b) at \nwar with itself on multiple fronts.  It subverts the \nguiding principles of the Federal Rules of Civil \nProcedure.  And it contradicts this Court\u2019s precedents.   \nThose decisions confirm that Rule 60(b)(6) \u201cis \navailable only when Rules 60(b)(1) through (b)(5) are \ninapplicable.\u201d  Kemp v. United States, 596 U.S. 528, \n533 (2022).  \u201cEven then, \u2018extraordinary circumstances\u2019 \nmust justify [the] reopening\u201d of a final judgment.  Id. \n(quoting Liljeberg v. Health Servs. Acquisition Corp., \n486 U.S. 847, 863 n.11 (1988)).  And a party\u2019s \u201cfree, \ncalculated, deliberate choices are not to be relieved \nfrom.\u201d  Ackermann v. United States, 340 U.S. 193, 198 \n(1950).  Rather, the party must be wholly \u201cfaultless in \nthe delay.\u201d  Pioneer Inv. Servs. Co. v. Brunswick \nAssocs. Ltd. P\u2019ship, 507 U.S. 380, 393 (1993). \nRespondents largely ignore these foundational \nprinciples.  That is because they cannot salvage the \nSecond Circuit\u2019s backwards approach or the mess it \nwould make of Rule 60(b) and the Federal Rules more \nbroadly.  Instead, Respondents try to avoid the Second \nCircuit\u2019s analysis, insisting that the court did not \nactually \u201c\u2018jettison\u2019 the extraordinary circumstances \nstandard\u201d and, in fact, \u201cd[id] not \u2018hold\u2019 anything.\u201d  \nResp.Br.22, 25 (citation omitted). \nThey are wrong on both points.  The Second Circuit \nexpressly abandoned the extraordinary circumstances \nstandard, and it held that the District Court erred by \napplying it.  In doing so, the Second Circuit \n\n2 \n \nacknowledged that a \u201cplaintiff is ordinarily entitled to \nRule 60(b)(6) relief \u2018only when there are extraordinary \ncircumstances justifying relief.\u2019\u201d  Pet.App.7 (emphasis \nadded; citation omitted).  \u201cBut,\u201d according to the \nSecond Circuit, the standard changes when \u201c\u2018vacatur \nis sought in order to obtain leave to file an amended \ncomplaint.\u2019\u201d  Pet.App.7 (quoting Mandala v. NTT \nData, Inc., 88 F.4th 353, 361 (2d Cir. 2023)).  In that \ncase, the Second Circuit believed that \u201c\u2018special \nconsiderations come into play\u2019\u201d that \u201crequire[] [district \ncourts] to consider Rule 60(b) finality and Rule 15(a) \nliberality in tandem.\u201d  Id. (quoting Mandala, 88 F.4th \nat 361).  Based on that mistaken view of the Federal \nRules, the Second Circuit held that the District Court \nabused its discretion by evaluating Respondents\u2019 Rule \n60(b) motion \u201cunder only Rule 60(b)\u2019s standard.\u201d  Id. \nThis Court should reverse and hold that the \nDistrict Court acted well within its discretion when it \napplied Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s high bar to deny relief.  Indeed, \nRespondents\u2019 \nsuggestion \nthat \nextraordinary \ncircumstances exist here only underscores the \nproblems with the Second Circuit\u2019s test.  Everything \nthey point to sounds in \u201cmistake, inadvertence, \nsurprise, or excusable neglect.\u201d  Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(1).  \nAs a result, Rule 60(b)(6) relief is categorically \nunavailable to them.  Rule 60(b)(1)\u2019s one-year deadline \ninstead applies\u2014and it expired before Respondents \nfiled their motion. \nRespondents\u2019 repeated and deliberate waivers also \nforeclose post-judgment relief.  They do not dispute \n\u201cthat they twice declined the opportunity to amend \ntheir Complaint before [the District] Court dismissed \nit,\u201d only to then \u201cwaive[]\u201d any challenge to the \u201c\u2018with \n\n3 \n \nprejudice\u2019 aspect of the dismissal\u201d on appeal.  \nPet.App.16 & n.4.  Nor do they dispute that it would \nhave been \u201can abuse of discretion\u201d for the lower courts \nto \u201coverride a [litigant\u2019s] deliberate waiver.\u201d  Wood v. \nMilyard, 566 U.S. 463, 472-73 (2012) (citation \nomitted).  That should be the end of the matter.  \nRespondents chose to stand or fall on their complaint \nas pled and unequivocally stated that they \u201cwould not \nseek leave to amend.\u201d  Pet.App.94.   \nRespondents gloss over these facts by claiming that \n\u201cthe Second Circuit did not find any waiver.\u201d  \nResp.Br.23.  But the District Court did, and the Second \nCircuit nowhere disagreed.  It nonetheless refused to \nuphold the District Court\u2019s decision\u2014notwithstanding \nthe waivers\u2014because the District Court had not given \n\u201cdue regard\u201d to \u201cthe liberal amendment policy of Rule \n15(a).\u201d  Pet.App.7 (quoting Mandala, 88 F.4th at 361).  \nThat was error.  Respondents \u201ccannot be relieved\u201d of \ntheir litigation choices merely \u201cbecause hindsight \nseems to indicate\u201d that those decisions were ill-\nadvised.  Ackermann, 340 U.S. at 199.  Thus, Rule \n60(b)(6) \u201chas no application to [this] situation.\u201d  Id. at \n202.  And, because a final judgment is in place, neither \ndoes Rule 15(a). \nThis Court should reverse the decision below, \nreinstate the District Court\u2019s denial of Respondents\u2019 \nRule 60(b) motion, and bring this case to an end. \n\n4 \n \nARGUMENT \nI. A Party Seeking To Vacate A Final Judgment \nFor Purposes Of Amendment Must Satisfy \nRule 60(b)\u2019s Stringent Standards. \nThe Second Circuit\u2019s balancing test dilutes Rule \n60(b)\u2019s exacting requirements for post-judgment relief \nwithout any basis in text, context, or precedent.  \nRespondents ignore the glaring problems with that \napproach.  And their arguments only highlight the \nflaws in the decision below. \nA. Rule 60(b)(6) Requires \u201cExtraordinary \nCircumstances\u201d Not Covered by Any Other \nProvision of Rule 60(b). \nRespondents\u2019 Rule 60(b)(6) motion should have \nbeen analyzed under Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s standard.  This \nCourt has consistently \u201crequired a movant seeking \nrelief under Rule 60(b)(6) to show \u2018extraordinary \ncircumstances\u2019 justifying the reopening of a final \njudgment.\u201d  Gonzalez v. Crosby, 545 U.S. 524, 535 \n(2005) (quoting Ackermann, 340 U.S. at 199); see \nPet.Br.23 (collecting cases).  This Court has also long \nstressed that Rule 60(b)(6) is \u201cmutually exclusive\u201d \nwith the other grounds for relief in Rule 60(b).  \nLiljeberg, 486 U.S. at 863 n.11.  The Rule\u2019s text and \nstructure dictate both of these principles.  See \nPet.Br.23, 27-28, 31-34.  Yet the decision below flouts \nthem.  And Respondents provide no basis to discard \nthese basic requirements where plaintiffs seek to \nrevive their case with an amended complaint. \nPerhaps recognizing the Second Circuit\u2019s misstep, \nRespondents start off by suggesting that the court did \nnot \u201cabandon[] the \u2018extraordinary circumstances\u2019 \n\n5 \n \nstandard in favor of a nebulous \u2018balanc[ing]\u2019 inquiry.\u201d  \nResp.Br.24 (citation omitted).  But that is wrong.  The \ndecision below rebuked the \u201cordinar[y]\u201d Rule 60(b)(6) \nstandard for one that \u201cbalance[s] Rule 60(b)\u2019s finality \nprinciples \nand \nRule \n15(a)\u2019s \nliberal \npleading \nprinciples.\u201d  Pet.App.7; see also Pet.App.8 (holding \nthat the District Court\u2019s extraordinary circumstances \n\u201cframework for analyzing [Respondents\u2019] motion was \nerroneous as a matter of law\u201d). \nThat analytical mistake was compelled by Second \nCircuit \nprecedent. \n \nIn \nMandala, \nthe \ncourt \nacknowledged the \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d test.  \n88 F.4th at 361.  But then it cast that standard aside \nto hold that, when a plaintiff seeks to amend, a district \ncourt abuses its discretion by \u201cdenying post-judgment \nrelief\u201d based solely on the movant\u2019s \u201cfailure to \ndemonstrate adequate grounds for relief under Rule \n60.\u201d  Id. at 362 & n.5.  That makes no sense.  As Judge \nSullivan countered in his Mandala dissent, \u201cit is \nbeyond cavil that a party\u2019s failure to demonstrate \nextraordinary circumstances is alone a sufficient \njustification for denying postjudgment relief under \nRule 60(b)(6).\u201d  Id. at 369 n.2 (Sullivan, J., dissenting).  \nThat is, after all, the standard for Rule 60(b)(6) relief.  \nAnd it is the standard that should have applied here. \nRespondents then later pull an about face, \nacknowledging that the Second Circuit did apply a \n\u201cbalancing test\u201d that imports \u201cthe policies embodied in \nRule 15(a)\u201d into the vacatur analysis.  Resp.Br.25 \n(quotation marks omitted).  But they offer no \npersuasive defense of that misguided approach. \n\n6 \n \n1. The Second Circuit\u2019s Balancing Test \nLacks Any Precedential Support. \nRespondents cannot ground the Second Circuit\u2019s \nbalancing test in the text or context of Rule 60(b)(6).  \nAccordingly, \nthey \nspend \nover \na \ndozen \npages \nmeandering through caselaw (at 25-38) in an effort to \ndownplay the novelty of that outlier position.  But they \nconcede that other decisions are \u201cout of step\u201d with the \nSecond Circuit\u2019s interpretation.  Resp.Br.33.  And \nRespondents do not rely on any case that helps them. \nRespondents fumble (at 27) for support in Krupski \nv. Costa Crociere S. p. A., 560 U.S. 538 (2010).  But \nthat case addressed the scope of \u201crelation back under \nRule 15(c)(1)(C),\u201d as defined by \u201cthe text of the Rule.\u201d  \nId. at 541, 547.  Krupski said nothing about the proper \nstandard for reopening a judgment under Rule 60(b).  \nThat is the Rule that governs \u201cRelief from a Final \nJudgment, Order, or Proceeding.\u201d  Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b). \nRespondents also double down (at 26-27) on Foman \nv. Davis, 371 U.S. 178 (1962).  But they concede that \ncase involved a motion \u201cunder Rule 59(e), not Rule \n60(b).\u201d  Resp.Br.27 n.3.  As explained in the Opening \nBrief, that distinction matters.  See Pet.Br.34-35.  And \nwhile Respondents try to characterize the specific rule \nin Foman as \u201ccompletely irrelevant to this Court\u2019s \nanalysis,\u201d Resp.Br.27 n.3, that is not true.  The proper \nstandard for a Rule 60(b) motion was not before the \nFoman Court, and Rule 59(e) and Rule 60(b) impose \n\u201cdifferent standards\u201d for relief \u201cby their own terms.\u201d  \nDaulatzai v. Maryland, 97 F.4th 166, 177 (4th Cir. \n2024).  Hence, the Rule 59(e) motion in Foman was \n\u201cnot controlled by the same exacting substantive \nrequirements\u201d codified in Rule 60(b)\u2019s text.  Priester v. \n\n7 \n \nJP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., 927 F.3d 912, 913 (5th \nCir. 2019) (quotation marks omitted).   \nNor is it surprising that the standards would differ \nbetween the two rules.  They serve markedly different \nfunctions.  A Rule 59(e) motion operates as \u201ca limited \ncontinuation of the original proceeding\u201d and plays \u201ca \npart [in] producing the final judgment,\u201d whereas a \nRule 60(b) motion \u201cthreaten[s] an already final \njudgment with successive litigation.\u201d  Banister v. \nDavis, 590 U.S. 504, 519, 521 (2020); see Pet.Br.34-35.  \nRule 60(b) thus naturally poses a higher bar for relief. \nRespondents next trumpet (at 29-31, 33, 35-38) a \nparade of lower court decisions.  But those cases, \nobviously, do not control this Court\u2019s analysis.  And \nmost of them similarly addressed Rule 59(e) motions, \nnot Rule 60(b) motions.1  So, they are simply off-point \nas well.  Rules 59(e) and 60(b) are not fungible, and \nRespondents fail to offer any reason to merge the two \ntextually and functionally distinct rules into one. \nNor do any of the few 60(b) cases that Respondents \nlean on (at 29-30) provide them any support.  Those \ndecisions merely recognize that the Rules\u2019 drafters \nalready balanced the needs for \u201cfinality\u201d and \u201cjustice\u201d \n \n1  See, e.g., Runnion ex rel. Runnion v. Girl Scouts of Greater Chi. \n& Nw. Ind., 786 F.3d 510, 523 (7th Cir. 2015); NewSpin Sports, \nLLC v. Arrow Elecs., Inc., 910 F.3d 293, 299 (7th Cir. 2018); \nUnited States ex rel. Customs Fraud Investigations, LLC v. \nVictaulic Co., 839 F.3d 242, 248-49 (3d Cir. 2016); Jang v. Bos. \nSci. Scimed, Inc., 729 F.3d 357, 368 (3d Cir. 2013); Rosenzweig v. \nAzurix Corp., 332 F.3d 854, 863-64 (5th Cir. 2003); Firestone v. \nFirestone, 76 F.3d 1205, 1208 (D.C. Cir. 1996); S. Constructors \nGrp. v. Dynalectric Co., 2 F.3d 606, 611 (5th Cir. 1993); see also \nAllen v. Walmart Stores, L.L.C., 907 F.3d 170, 184 (5th Cir. 2018). \n\n8 \n \nin Rule 60(b) itself.  Phelps v. Alameida, 569 F.3d 1120, \n1133 (9th Cir. 2009) (citation omitted).  None suggests \nthat courts should then smuggle in Rule 15(a)\u2019s liberal \nrepleading principles as an additional variable to tip \nthe scales against finality under Rule 60(b).  The \nSecond Circuit stands alone by imposing that \nextratextual requirement.2 \nRespondents also rely heavily on United States v. \nMask of Ka-Nefer-Nefer, 752 F.3d 737 (8th Cir. 2014).  \nBut that was a Rule 60(b)(1) case, not a Rule 60(b)(6) \ncase.  See id. at 743.  And it only further illustrates \nwhy Respondents are wrong here.  Like every other \nCourt of Appeals, see Pet.Br.21 n.3, the Eighth Circuit \nthere held that courts may grant leave to amend only \nif doing so \u201cis consistent with the stringent standards \ngoverning the grant of . . . Rule 60(b) relief,\u201d 752 F.3d \n \n2  Other decisions cited by Respondents do not address either \nRule 59(e) or Rule 60(b) motions.  See, e.g., Gondeck v. Pan Am. \nWorld Airways, Inc., 382 U.S. 25, 26-28 (1965); Jack v. Evonik \nCorp., 79 F.4th 547, 565 (5th Cir. 2023); Tate v. SCR Med. \nTransp., 809 F.3d 343, 346 (7th Cir. 2015); Calvary Christian Ctr. \nv. City of Fredericksburg, 710 F.3d 536, 539-41 (4th Cir. 2013); \nUnited States ex rel. Lee v. Corinthian Colls., 655 F.3d 984, 998 \n(9th Cir. 2011); Dubicz v. Commonwealth Edison Co., 377 F.3d \n787, 790-91 (7th Cir. 2004); Duggins v. Steak \u2019n Shake, Inc., 195 \nF.3d 828, 834 (6th Cir. 1999); Moore v. City of Paducah, 790 F.2d \n557, 559-60 (6th Cir. 1986); Oil, Chem. & Atomic Workers Int\u2019l \nUnion, AFL-CIO v. Delta Refin. Co., 277 F.2d 694, 697 (6th Cir. \n1960); Marranzano v. Riggs Nat\u2019l Bank, 184 F.2d 349, 351 (D.C. \nCir. 1950).  Nor do any of them deal with circumstances like \nthese, in which Respondents engaged in a \u201cdocumented series of \ndeliberate choices not to cure the deficiencies identified in their \npleading\u201d prior to dismissal.  Pet.App.19; cf. Foster v. DeLuca, 545 \nF.3d 582, 584 (7th Cir. 2008) (no waiver by plaintiff, who filed a \ncombined Rule 59(e) and 60(b) motion just a week after the \ndistrict court terminated the case without warning). \n\n9 \n \nat 743.  It then affirmed the district court\u2019s denial of \npost-judgment relief where, as here, the plaintiff \n\u201cknew many months prior to the Order of Dismissal of \nthe possible need to amend its pleading and elected to \n\u2018stand or fall\u2019\u201d on its complaint.  Id. at 744; see \nPet.App.15-18.  The Second Circuit should have \nreached the same result. \nFinally, Respondents cobble together (at 37) a trio \nof this Court\u2019s precedents that have nothing to do with \nthe question presented in this case.  None even \nmentions Rule 60(b), let alone purports to analyze the \nproper standard for a plaintiff seeking relief from a \nfinal judgment.  Nor did they have occasion to do so.  \nIn Tellabs, Inc. v. Makor Issues & Rights, Ltd., 551 \nU.S. 308, 329 (2007), this Court merely remanded for \napplication of a legal standard to the facts alleged.  In \nAshcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 666 (2009), this Court \nconfronted an \u201cinterlocutory appeal,\u201d not an appeal \nfrom a final judgment.  And in Johnson v. City of \nShelby, 574 U.S. 10, 12 (2014), this Court \u201creversed\u201d \nan improper dismissal, meaning there was no longer a \nfinal judgment on remand. \nHere, by contrast, Respondents seek to set aside a \ndismissal with prejudice that was affirmed on appeal.  \nPet.App.49-53.  A final judgment remains in place.  \nThus, Respondents must \u201csatisfy one of the Rule 60(b) \ngrounds before [the] court may consider [a] motion to \namend.\u201d  Daulatzai, 97 F.4th at 178.  \u201cThe permissive \npolicy favoring amendment under Rule 15 [is] simply \nnot relevant\u201d until they make that showing.  Garrett \nv. Wexford Health, 938 F.3d 69, 86 (3d Cir. 2019).  The \nSecond Circuit erred in holding to the contrary. \n\n10 \n \n2. Respondents\u2019 Other Arguments Are \nMeritless. \nBeyond citing inapposite precedents, Respondents \nsay little else to defend the decision below.  They do \nnot suggest that the Second Circuit\u2019s outlier approach \nfinds any support in Rule 60(b)\u2019s text.  They do not rely \non the Rule\u2019s history or structure.  They do not dispute \nthat the decision below thwarts the \u201cspeedy\u201d and \n\u201cinexpensive\u201d resolution of claims.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 1.  \nAnd they do not explain how it is \u201cjust\u201d to relieve \nplaintiffs from their own litigation choices\u2014which \nwould burden both defendants and the courts with \nduplicative litigation.  Id.; see Pet.Br.37; Mandala, 88 \nF.4th at 369 (Sullivan, J., dissenting). \nNor do Respondents grapple with the many ways \nin which the Second Circuit\u2019s balancing test clashes \nwith other provisions of Rule 60(b).  See Pet.Br.31-34.  \nThey do not dispute that it enables plaintiffs to evade \nRule 60\u2019s strict time limitations where allegations are \nomitted by \u201cexcusable neglect.\u201d  Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(1), \n(c)(1).  Nor do they explain why plaintiffs could wield \nRule 60(b)(6) to introduce previously available facts \nyears after judgment, when Rule 60 elsewhere limits \nrelief to matters \u201cnewly discovered\u201d within a year of \njudgment that \u201ccould not have been discovered\u201d before \nwith \u201creasonable diligence.\u201d  Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(2).  \nThe Second Circuit\u2019s test invites that internal \ninconsistency.  See Mandala, 88 F.4th at 365 (ordering \nvacatur and amendment \u201cbased on information that \nwas publicly available for years prior to the filing of \nthe Complaint\u201d). \nAs to mistake, Respondents claim that \u201cthe Second \nCircuit has never suggested that vacatur and \n\n11 \n \namendment are permissible where a complaint failed \ndue to counsel\u2019s mistake.\u201d  Resp.Br.43.  But, even \nsetting aside the fact that Rule 60(b)(1) is not limited \nto counsel\u2019s mistakes, see Kemp, 596 U.S. at 534-35, \nthe Second Circuit has required just that.  It deployed \nits balancing test in Mandala to compel the reopening \nof a final judgment, even though the \u201cvacatur motion \nar[ose] from a legal mistake based on insufficient \npleading.\u201d  88 F.4th at 360.  That is precisely \nRespondents\u2019 theory here too\u2014that they made a legal \nmistake as to which facts they needed to allege to \nsatisfy JASTA\u2019s statutory standard.  See Resp.Br.45.3 \nRetreating from Rule 60(b), Respondents note that \nRule 15 \u201ccontemplates two stages of amendment\u2014\nbefore trial and during or after trial.\u201d  Resp.Br.42.  Yet, \nthey fail to explain why that might bear on the \nthreshold vacatur inquiry, which necessarily occurs in \nthe post-judgment context.  At that point, \u201c[t]he suit is \nover.\u201d  Pe\u00f1a v. Mattox, 84 F.3d 894, 903 (7th Cir. 1996).  \n\u201cThere is no complaint to amend.\u201d  Id.  And \nRespondents concede \u201cthat Rule 15(a) \u2018does not \nprovide a mechanism for amending pleadings after \ndismissal.\u2019\u201d  Resp.Br.42 (quoting Pet.Br.30).  Rather, \nRule 60(b) defines the \u201climited set of circumstances\u201d \nthat might allow the losing party to \u201crequest \nreopening of his case.\u201d  Gonzalez, 545 U.S. at 528.  \n \n3  To be clear, Respondents\u2019 proposed amendments still fail to \nmeet JASTA\u2019s pleading standards under this Court\u2019s decision in \nTwitter, Inc. v. Taamneh, 598 U.S. 471 (2023), and the Second \nCircuit\u2019s own precedents.  That question is not presented here \nbecause the District Court correctly instructed the parties not to \naddress futility (a Rule 15 question) until Respondents first \ndemonstrated that they could justify vacatur under Rule \n60(b)(6)\u2014which they could not.  See Pet.App.11, 13; JA.509. \n\n12 \n \nWhile Respondents baldly insist that Rule 15(a) lurks \nin the background to \u201cpresumably inform[] the reasons \nthat \u2018justify relief\u2019 under Rule 60(b)(6),\u201d Resp.Br.42-\n43, that is simply wrong.  \u201cAs long as the judgment \nremains in effect, Rule 15(a) is inapposite.\u201d  Fisher v. \nKadant, Inc., 589 F.3d 505, 508-09 (1st Cir. 2009). \nIf anything, Respondents\u2019 invocation of Rule 15(b) \nrefutes their approach.  That Rule contemplates two \ntypes of late-breaking amendments, neither of which \napplies here.  First, if a party objects that its \nopponent\u2019s evidence at trial deviates from the \npleadings, then the \u201ccourt should freely permit an \namendment when doing so will aid in presenting the \nmerits and the objecting party fails to satisfy the court \nthat the evidence would prejudice that party\u2019s action \nor defense on the merits.\u201d  Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(b)(1).  \nSecond, \u201c[w]hen an issue not raised by the pleadings \nis tried by the parties\u2019 express or implied consent, it \nmust be treated in all respects as if raised in the \npleadings.\u201d  Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(b)(2).  In that situation, \n\u201c[a] party may move\u2014at any time, even after \njudgment\u2014to amend the pleadings to conform them to \nthe evidence and to raise an unpleaded issue.\u201d  Id.4  \nRule 15 thus contemplates a single, narrow, consent-\nbased ground for a party to amend \u201cafter judgment.\u201d  \nId.  In turn, the \u201ctraditional rule\u201d of expressio unius est \nexclusio alterius confirms that Rule 15 does not apply \nto any other post-judgment efforts to amend.  Bittner \nv. United States, 598 U.S. 85, 94 (2023).  Rather, post-\n \n4  A \u201cfailure to amend does not affect the result of the trial of that \nissue.\u201d  Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(b)(2).  But amendment can be \u201cuseful in \nclarifying the record on appeal or in determining the preclusive \neffects to be given to the judgment.\u201d  3 James Wm. Moore et al., \nMoore\u2019s Federal Practice \u00a7 15.18[1] (3d ed. 2024). \n\n13 \n \njudgment relief falls squarely within the bailiwick of \nRule 60(b). \nTaking a slightly different tack, Respondents insist \nthat \u201c[p]laintiffs should have the opportunity to have \ntheir case adjudicated on the merits.\u201d  Resp.Br.24.  But \nthey did, in fact, have their case decided on the merits:  \nA final \u201cdismissal with prejudice\u201d is an \u201cadjudication \non the merits.\u201d  Lomax v. Ortiz-Marquez, 590 U.S. 595, \n601 (2020) (quotation marks omitted).  Respondents \nmerely lost that merits battle.  Along the way, they \ndeliberately chose to stand on their complaint.  They \ndeclined to appeal the \u201cwith prejudice\u201d aspect of the \ndismissal.  Then they lost again on appeal.  As a result, \nthey cannot reopen the judgment to pursue an \namended complaint unless they satisfy the strictures \nof Rule 60(b). \nIn short, where a losing party seeks leave to file an \namended complaint following a final judgment, it \nmust first clear Rule 60(b)\u2019s deliberately high hurdle \nfor setting aside that judgment.  The Second Circuit \nerred in collapsing these two inquiries into a single, \nnebulous balancing test. \nB. Respondents Concede that Rule 60(b)(6) \nProvides No Basis for Relief from a Party\u2019s \nVoluntary Litigation Choices. \nRespondents likewise cannot square the Second \nCircuit\u2019s approach with basic principles of waiver.  \nIndeed, they do not contest that it would be an abuse \nof discretion for a court to \u201cexcuse a party\u2019s voluntary \nwaiver of a court\u2019s invitation to amend.\u201d  Pet.Br.28; see \nWood, 566 U.S. at 472-73.   \n\n14 \n \nIt could hardly be otherwise.  Our adversarial \nsystem of justice \u201cis designed around the premise that \nparties represented by competent counsel know what \nis best for them, and are responsible for advancing the \nfacts and argument entitling them to relief.\u201d  United \nStates v. Sineneng-Smith, 590 U.S. 371, 375-76 (2020) \n(citation and brackets omitted).  Thus, where a \nplaintiff makes a \u201cvoluntary\u201d choice to rest on their \npleadings\u2014thereby waiving the opportunity to amend \ntheir complaint\u2014Rule 60(b)(6) provides no recourse.  \nAckermann, 340 U.S. at 200. \nThat principle applies with equal force to \nforfeitures in the context of Rule 60(b)(6).  Rule 60(b) \nmakes clear that if a party is even \u201cpartly to blame for \nthe delay, relief must be sought within one year under \nsubsection (1) and the party\u2019s neglect must be \nexcusable.\u201d  Pioneer Inv. Servs., 507 U.S. at 393.  That \nparty cannot \u201cseek relief more than a year after the \njudgment by resorting to subsection (6).\u201d  Id.; see \nPet.Br.27-28.   \nRespondents do not contest this either.  Yet, the \nSecond Circuit\u2019s balancing test contravenes that \nframework.  It enables plaintiffs to obtain relief \nthrough Rule 60(b)(6) even when they \u201cwere \nrepeatedly apprised\u201d prior to judgment of the \u201cprecise \npleading defect\u201d that led to dismissal.  Mandala, 88 \nF.4th at 368 (Sullivan, J., dissenting); see also \nPet.App.19 (similar).  Granting such a mulligan to \nplaintiffs who caused their own predicament defies the \ntext and structure of Rule 60(b). \nNone of this is to suggest that Rule 60(b) can never \nprovide an avenue for plaintiffs seeking to set aside a \njudgment to pursue an amended complaint.  But the \n\n15 \n \nRule itself sets the parameters for doing so.  For \ninstance, if a plaintiff\u2019s belated allegations were \nomitted because of its \u201cinadvertence\u201d or \u201cexcusable \nneglect,\u201d then Rule 60(b)(1) provides a year in which \nto seek relief.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(1), (c)(1).  The same \ngoes for \u201cnewly discovered evidence\u201d that could not \nhave been found earlier with \u201creasonable diligence.\u201d  \nFed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(2).  And so too for a \u201cmistake\u201d \nmade by either the court or the parties or their \nattorneys\u2014whether that be an \u201cerror[] \u2018of law or fact.\u2019\u201d  \nKemp, 596 U.S. at 534 (quoting Black\u2019s Law \nDictionary 1195 (3d ed. 1933)); see Fed. R. Civ. P. \n60(b)(1).  A party can also seek relief under Rule 59(e)\u2019s \nmore forgiving standard within 28 days of judgment.  \nOr, in rare cases, truly extraordinary circumstances \noutside the party\u2019s control might justify relief under \nRule 60(b)(6).  Cf. Klapprott v. United States, 335 U.S. \n601, 613-15 (1949) (lead op.). \nBut what plaintiffs cannot do is what Respondents \ndid here\u2014waive multiple opportunities to amend, \nlitigate the matter to final judgment, drag their \nopponent through an unsuccessful appeal, and then \ntry to use Rule 60(b)(6) to start the process all over.  \n\u201cThere must be an end to litigation someday, and free, \ncalculated, deliberate choices are not to be relieved \nfrom.\u201d  Ackermann, 340 U.S. at 198. \nII. Respondents Cannot Satisfy Rule 60(b)(6). \nUnder the proper Rule 60(b)(6) standard, this is a \nstraightforward \ncase. \n \nPetitioner \nrepeatedly \nemphasized that the complaint failed to allege that the \nbank was aware of a link between the Three \nCustomers and Hamas \u201cat the time\u201d it provided the \ncustomers routine banking services.  Pet.App.109; \n\n16 \n \nJA.145; JA.175-77; JA.249-51.  On multiple occasions, \nthe \nDistrict \nCourt \nafforded \nRespondents \nthe \nopportunity to cure any deficiencies in their pleadings \nthrough amendment.  Pet.App.93-94; Pet.App.124-25.  \nAnd, each time, Respondents \u201cexpressly declined\u201d the \ninvitation.  Pet.App.17-18.   \nThe District Court then dismissed their complaint, \nexplaining that it failed to plausibly allege Petitioner \n\u201cwas aware of a connection between the Three \nCustomers and Hamas at the time.\u201d  Pet.App.74-75.  \nThe Second Circuit affirmed, \u201cbecause the allegations \ndo not support an inference that [Petitioner] was \naware of the Three Customers\u2019 ties with Hamas prior \nto the relevant attacks.\u201d  Pet.App.49.  Only then did \nRespondents seek to reopen the judgment to file an \namended complaint\u2014in direct contradiction to their \nprior position that they \u201cwould not seek leave to \namend.\u201d  Pet.App.94. \nThis is thus a classic case of litigator\u2019s remorse, for \nwhich Rule 60(b)(6) provides no relief.  Through \nsophisticated counsel, Respondents repeatedly waived \nor forfeited opportunities to amend their complaint in \nboth the District Court and the Court of Appeals.  \nThese litigation choices led to dismissal with prejudice \nand affirmance on appeal.  And Respondents have not \n\u201cshow[n] \u2018extraordinary circumstances\u2019 justifying the \nreopening of a final judgment.\u201d  Gonzalez, 545 U.S. at \n535 (quoting Ackermann, 340 U.S. at 199); see \nPet.App.14-19.  The District Court certainly did not \nabuse its discretion in reaching that conclusion.   \nRespondents conspicuously fail to address this \ndeferential standard of review anywhere in their brief.  \n\n17 \n \nAnd their last-ditch effort (at 44-49) to demonstrate \nextraordinary circumstances falls flat.   \nTo start, Respondents insist that they \u201chave yet to \nbe afforded a single opportunity to amend their \ncomplaint.\u201d  Resp.Br.45 (citation omitted).  That is \ncategorically false.  They \u201ctwice expressly declined the \nopportunity to amend their complaint prior to the \n[District] Court\u2019s decision.\u201d  Pet.App.10.  And \nRespondents did not challenge the \u201cwith prejudice\u201d \naspect of the dismissal during their first appeal.  \nPet.App.16 n.4.  Those decisions were \u201ccalculated and \ndeliberate,\u201d and Respondents \u201ccannot be relieved\u201d \nfrom the consequences of those voluntary choices \nthrough Rule 60(b)(6).  Ackermann, 340 U.S. at 198; \nsee Pet.App.19.   \nRespondents elsewhere concede there is nothing \n\u201cextraordinary\u201d about dismissing a complaint where \n\u201cthe plaintiff has had a meaningful chance to amend.\u201d  \nResp.Br.34.  And their claim that the multiple chances \nthey received were not \u201cmeaningful\u201d is flatly incorrect.  \nResp.Br.46.  Prior to dismissal, they were consistently \napprised of the timing mismatch between their \nallegations of general awareness and Petitioner\u2019s \nalleged provision of banking services.  See Pet.App.19.  \nPetitioner raised this argument in its pre-motion \nletter, see JA.144-45, in its memorandum of law \nsupporting the motion to dismiss, see JA.160-61, 174-\n85, and in its statements at oral argument, see \nPet.App.108-09.  Yet, Respondents chose not to amend. \nThis requirement of contemporaneous awareness \nwas also nothing new.  It traces directly to Halberstam \nv. Welch, 705 F.2d 472 (D.C. Cir. 1983), which both \nCongress and the Second Circuit had already \n\n18 \n \nrecognized as providing the \u201cproper legal framework\u201d \nfor JASTA liability.  Linde v. Arab Bank, PLC, 882 F.3d \n314, 329 (2d Cir. 2018) (quoting JASTA, Pub. L. No. \n114-222, \u00a7 2(a)(5), 130 Stat. 852, 852 (2016)).  In fact, \nRespondents themselves urged the court to apply the \nHalberstam \nframework\u2014and \nacknowledged \nits \nrequirement that \u201cthe defendant must be generally \naware of his role . . . at the time he provides the \nassistance.\u201d  JA.210 (emphasis added) (quoting \nHalberstam, 705 F.2d at 477).  Respondents have \nnever \u201cexplain[ed] why they did not allege facts \nsufficient to satisfy the standard for which they were \nadvocating.\u201d  Pet.App.17 n.5.  Nor have they argued \n\u201cthat any of their proposed new allegations were \nunavailable to them when given the opportunity to \namend.\u201d  Pet.App.15.  At best, their tactical decisions \nnot \nto \namend \nwere \nthe \nresult \nof \n\u201cmistake, \ninadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect.\u201d  Fed. R. \nCiv. P. 60(b)(1).  And they were time-barred from \nreopening on that basis.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(c)(1).  \nThey cannot end-run those limitations via Rule \n60(b)(6).  See Kemp, 596 U.S. at 533; Pioneer Inv. \nServs., 507 U.S. at 393.5 \nRespondents next argue that the District Court\u2019s \n\u201cdismissal decision was premised on \u2018the wrong legal \n \n5  Respondents misconstrue (at 44) this interplay between \n60(b)(1) and 60(b)(6).  Petitioner has explained at length why \n\u201cRespondents cannot satisfy Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s stringent standard.\u201d  \nPet.Br.38-45 (capitalization altered).  And that is in part because \nRespondents\u2019 Rule 60(b)(6) motion is, at best, \u201cbased on grounds \nspecified in clause (1).\u201d  Liljeberg, 486 U.S. at 863 n.11.  \nAccordingly, they cannot avail themselves of Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s \u201cany \nother reason\u201d language.  Id. (citation omitted); see Fed. R. Civ. P. \n60(b)(6); Pet.Br.1, 16-17, 27-29, 31-33, 43-44.   \n\n19 \n \nstandard.\u2019\u201d  Resp.Br.47.  But that argument similarly \nruns straight into the teeth of Rule 60(b)(1), which \n\u201ccovers all mistakes of law made by a judge.\u201d  Kemp, \n596 U.S. at 534.  Rule 60(b)(6) is thus inapplicable.  \nSee id. at 533. \nMoreover, any supposed legal errors cannot excuse \nRespondents\u2019 waivers here because the District Court \ndid not articulate what standard it would apply until \nit issued its decision.  That decision came after \nRespondents proclaimed they \u201cwould not seek leave to \namend\u201d and after they confirmed \u201c[t]here are no facts \nthat [they] would have\u201d to address the deficiencies \nPetitioner identified\u2014including the lack of allegations \nsupporting awareness.  Pet.App.94, 125.  Respondents\u2019 \nallegations on this front were deficient in both the eyes \nof the District Court and the Second Circuit.  And the \n\u201c[District] \nCourt\u2019s \nruling \nthat \n[Respondents\u2019] \ncomplaint d[id] not plausibly allege that [Petitioner] \nwas generally aware of any connection between the \nThree Customers and Hamas [was] not meaningfully \ndifferent from the Second Circuit\u2019s ruling as to this \nsame basis for affirming th[e] Court\u2019s dismissal.\u201d  \nPet.App.15 n.3 (quotation marks omitted); see \nPet.App.49-52. \nTo the extent the two decisions differed, any \n\u201cclarification\u201d by the Second Circuit did not compel the \nDistrict Court to reopen its affirmed final judgment.  \nCongress did not amend JASTA, and the Second \nCircuit\u2019s decision in the first appeal did not overrule \nprior precedents.  It merely applied the statutory text \nand existing caselaw to the facts alleged.  Thus, there \nwas no change in law.  Respondents instead argue only \nthat the District Court \u201cmisapplied controlling law.\u201d  \n\n20 \n \nResp.Br.12 (emphasis added).  In Kemp, this Court \nheld that this precise type of attack on a final \njudgment falls within Rule 60(b)(1), not Rule 60(b)(6).  \nSee 596 U.S. at 535 n.2 (\u201cKemp alleged that the \nDistrict Court erred by misapplying controlling \nlaw[.]\u201d); see also Pet.Br.32-33, 40-41.6   \nFurther, to the extent Respondents claim they \n\u201ccould not anticipate\u201d the Second Circuit\u2019s ruling, \nResp.Br.48, that too is just another way of saying they \nwere \u201csurprise[d],\u201d made a pleading \u201cmistake,\u201d or \nfailed to include the allegations previously available to \nthem because of \u201cinadvertence\u201d or \u201cexcusable neglect.\u201d  \nFed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(1).  All of those grounds for relief \nare explicitly covered by Rule 60(b)(1), and thus fall \noutside Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s \u201cother reason\u201d language. \nIn any event, this case pales in comparison to those \nfew extraordinary cases where this Court has found \nRule 60(b)(6) relief appropriate.  In Klapprott, for \nexample, the petitioner sought to set aside a default \njudgment renouncing his citizenship, because he had \nbeen \u201cweakened from illness,\u201d unable to obtain \ncounsel, \u201cwrongfully\u201d detained, and then imprisoned \nby \n\u201chis \nadversary \nin \nthe \ndenaturalization \nproceedings,\u201d with \u201cno reasonable opportunity\u201d to \ndefend himself.  335 U.S. at 607-08, 613-15.  In \n \n6  Respondents insist (at 48) that an outright change in law might \nsometimes justify post-judgment relief.  But this Court has made \nclear that a change in law is not per se \u201cextraordinary.\u201d  See \nGonzalez, 545 U.S. at 536-37.  Whether it ever can be a basis for \n60(b)(6) relief, as opposed to a \u201c\u2018mistake\u2019 under Rule 60(b)(1),\u201d is \nan open question.  Kemp, 596 U.S. at 535 n.2.  Regardless, \nbecause the law here did not change and Respondents argue only \nthat the District Court \u201cmisapplied controlling law,\u201d this Court \nneed not address the issue. \n\n21 \n \nLiljeberg, the judge who presided over a bench trial \n\u201cinexcusabl[y]\u201d failed to recuse himself, despite an \n\u201cobvious conflict of interest\u201d that the movant could not \nreasonably discover.  486 U.S. at 850, 863-66 & n.11.  \nAnd in Buck v. Davis, the petitioner \u201cidentified 11 \nfactors\u201d in his capital murder case\u2014including the \nintroduction of expert evidence suggesting \u201cthe color \nof [his] skin made him more deserving of execution,\u201d \nthe State\u2019s confession of error in similar cases, and \nchanged controlling law that removed a procedural \n\u201cbar[]\u201d to habeas review\u2014which could collectively \nwarrant relief.  580 U.S. 100, 113, 118-26 (2017). \nThis case is a far cry from those.  Respondents \u201chad \nample opportunity to pursue all legal avenues \navailable to them for relief,\u201d but simply chose not to \npursue them.  Pet.App.16.  They are hardly \u201cfaultless \nin the delay.\u201d  Pioneer Inv. Servs., 507 U.S. at 393.  \nThat precludes them from obtaining relief under Rule \n60(b)(6), and the District Court certainly did not abuse \nits discretion by denying Respondents\u2019 motion.   \nSwitching gears, Respondents assert that the \n\u201cburden of re-briefing a motion to dismiss\u201d is \u201cnot the \nkind of prejudice\u201d contemplated by Rule 15(a).  \nResp.Br.45.  Again, though, Respondents needed to \nsatisfy Rule 60(b)\u2019s \u201cmore restrictive standard\u201d for \nvacating the final judgment \u201cbefore consideration \n[could] be given to [a Rule 15(a)] motion to amend.\u201d  \nDaulatzai, 97 F.4th at 179.  Those two Rules pose \nseparate inquiries.  See Pet.Br.20-38.  In any case, \nRespondents waived multiple opportunities to amend, \nand the \u201cfederal rule of waiver does not include a \nprejudice requirement.\u201d  Morgan v. Sundance, Inc., \n596 U.S. 411, 419 (2022).  Even if it did, Petitioner \n\n22 \n \nwould clearly suffer prejudice if the Court were to \nnullify a final judgment\u2014secured after costly motions \npractice and then successfully defended in a \nprotracted appeal\u2014so that Respondents could pursue \na strategy they repeatedly rebuffed.  That is not how \nfederal litigation works. \nNor can Respondents dispute that they made a \n\u201cseries \nof \ndeliberate \nchoices\u201d \nnot \nto \namend.  \nPet.App.19.  They try to duck that inescapable \nconclusion as one \u201cnot accepted by the panel below.\u201d  \nResp.Br.23.  But the District Court made that factual \nfinding, and the Second Circuit did not disturb it.  Nor \ncould it, because Respondents waived or forfeited at \nleast five opportunities to amend\u2014each of which \nsuffices to bar relief.  \nFirst, the District Court asked Respondents at the \npre-motion conference if they wanted the \u201copportunity \nto amend\u201d to plead \u201cadditional facts\u201d based on \nPetitioner\u2019s arguments.  Pet.App.93.  Respondents\u2019 \ncounsel replied \u201cNo,\u201d and he averred that they \u201cwould \nnot seek leave to amend\u201d if the pleadings fell short.  \nPet.App.94.  That is a textbook waiver. \nSecond, the District Court asked at oral argument \non the motion to dismiss whether \u201ceverything [it] \nneed[ed] to consider in terms of sufficiency of [the] \npleading [was] going to be found in the complaint.\u201d  \nPet.App.124.  Respondents\u2019 counsel answered \u201cYes, \nYour Honor.\u201d  Pet.App.125.  Another textbook waiver. \nThird, Respondents opted not to file a Rule 59(e) \nmotion after the District Court\u2019s decision.  Doing so \nwould have enabled the court to consider a proposed \namended complaint and \u201cfix any mistakes\u201d that \n\n23 \n \nRespondents believed the court made, \u201cbefore a \npossible appeal.\u201d  Banister, 590 U.S. at 516. \nFourth, Respondents \u201cnever appealed the \u2018with \nprejudice\u2019 aspect of the dismissal, and accordingly, \nwaived it.\u201d  Pet.App.16 n.4.  Yet they seek the same \nrelief that such an appeal could have provided, while \ntacitly conceding that Rule 60(b)(6) \u201ccannot be used as \na substitute for appeal.\u201d  Pet.Br.44 (citation omitted). \nFifth, Respondents continued to sit on their hands \nbefore the Second Circuit, even though they admit \nthat \u201casking the circuit for leave to amend [was] \npermissible.\u201d  Resp.Br.40.  They forfeited that \nopportunity in their opening brief; they forfeited it in \ntheir reply brief; they forfeited it at oral argument; \nand they forfeited it in their supplemental brief. \n*   *   * \nIn the end, the Second Circuit\u2019s balancing test \ncollapses under the weight of text, context, structure, \nand precedent.  The proper inquiry for this Rule \n60(b)(6) motion is the one that has always applied to \nRule 60(b)(6) motions:  Respondents had to \u201cshow \n\u2018extraordinary circumstances,\u2019\u201d not covered by any \nother provision of the Rule, that were beyond their \ncontrol and that would \u201cjustify[] the reopening of a \nfinal judgment.\u201d  Gonzalez, 545 U.S. at 535 (citation \nomitted).  They failed to meet that high bar. \n \n \n\n24 \n \nCONCLUSION \nThe Court should reverse the judgment below. \n  \n \n \n \n  Respectfully submitted, \nJONATHAN R.

          "task_beliefs": "My understanding of this case, initially shaped by the petitioner's compelling Petition for a Writ of Certiorari, has now been significantly complicated and balanced by the respondents' Brief in Opposition. The core of the case remains the procedural clash between Rule 60(b)(6)'s \"extraordinary circumstances\" standard for finality and Rule 15(a)'s liberal policy for amending complaints.\n\nMy prior belief, leaning heavily toward reversal, was founded on two key pillars of the petitioner's argument: 1) the existence of a deep and lopsided 11-1 circuit split created by the Second Circuit's \"balancing test,\" and 2) the narrative that the respondents made a \"free, calculated, deliberate choice\" to stand on their initial complaint, thus waiving their right to amend and failing to meet the \"faultless\" standard required for Rule 60(b)(6) relief, as suggested by precedents like *Gonzalez v. Crosby* and *Ackermann v. United States*.\n\nThe Brief in Opposition directly and effectively attacks both of these pillars, resolving the primary uncertainties I had previously identified:\n\n1.  **Countering the Circuit Split:** The respondents refute the petitioner's claim of a stark 11-1 split. Instead of a conflict, they argue for a consistent national jurisprudence where the \"extraordinary circumstances\" test for Rule 60(b)(6) *inherently involves* balancing the value of finality against the preference for resolving cases on their merits. They ground this principle in Supreme Court precedent, notably *Krupski v. Costa Crociere S. p. A.*, and cite a broad array of cases from other circuits (e.g., *Runnion* in the 7th Cir., *Leisure Caviar* in the 6th Cir.) to argue that courts generally ensure a plaintiff gets at least one *meaningful* opportunity to amend, often post-dismissal once pleading defects are clarified. This reframes the landscape from a clear split to a nuanced consensus, significantly weakening the petitioner's argument for cert-worthiness and reversal.\n\n2.  **Countering the \"Calculated Choice\" Narrative:** The respondents construct a powerful counter-narrative to explain their decision not to amend pre-judgment. They argue their choice was not a \"calculated\" gamble but a reasonable refusal to perform a futile act. They contend the district court was applying the \"wrong legal standard\"\u2014a standard so \"exacting\" and \"all but impossible to meet\" before discovery that any attempt to amend would have been pointless. They highlight that they correctly argued the law (which was later vindicated by the Second Circuit and this Court in *Twitter v. Taamneh*), and only after the Second Circuit \"clarified\" the correct, achievable standard did they \"promptly\" move to amend. The brief powerfully quotes a Second Circuit judge's oral argument question\u2014\"What are they supposed to do? They know they can\u2019t amend [to] . . . meet that.\"\u2014to substantiate their claim that the opportunity to amend was not \"meaningful.\"\n\nThis new information fundamentally alters my predictive model. The case no longer appears to be the clean, abstract legal question the petitioner presented. The respondents have successfully framed it as a fact-bound, procedurally complex dispute where the Second Circuit was correcting a district court's specific legal errors in a non-precedential summary order. They argue the \"extraordinary circumstances\" are present here precisely because of this unique sequence: a dismissal based on the wrong law, an appellate clarification of the correct law, and a plaintiff's first request to amend to meet that newly clarified law.\n\nMy prediction has shifted dramatically. The strong lean toward reversal is gone. The case is now a toss-up, and an affirmance of the Second Circuit's remand is highly plausible. The Court may well see this as an inappropriate vehicle for a broad ruling, viewing the Second Circuit's action as routine docket management rather than the creation of a new, split-creating legal standard.",
          "design_beliefs": "My strategic framework for legal prediction continues to evolve and be refined with each observation. The initial heuristics remain foundational, but the acquisition of the respondents' brief provides critical validation for some and inspires new, more nuanced additions.\n\n1.  **Source Prioritization:** The Petition for a Writ of Certiorari is the best starting point. The Brief in Opposition is of equal, critical importance for a balanced prediction. Procedural filings remain low-priority.\n2.  **The \"Circuit Split\" Heuristic:** Identifying a claimed split is the fastest way to gauge a case's potential significance. This observation adds a crucial corollary: **Circuit Split Counter-Analysis.** Once a split is alleged by the petitioner, the highest-value inquiry is to determine the respondent's method of rebuttal. This typically involves arguing that the cited cases are distinguishable, that the petitioner mischaracterizes the law, or, as seen here, that a broader, harmonizing principle exists that resolves the apparent conflict. This dialectical approach to the split claim is essential.\n3.  **Strategic Framing Analysis:** Analyzing how a party frames facts to fit legal rules is key. This observation deepens this heuristic by highlighting the importance of how parties frame the **Question Presented**. The petitioner framed a clean, broad legal question ideal for SCOTUS review. The respondent successfully reframed it as a messy, fact-bound, case-specific issue, a classic strategy to deter review by making the case an unattractive vehicle for a major ruling.\n4.  **Iterative Information Gathering:** The process of claim and verification is central. The petitioner's claims (split, waiver) correctly pointed me to the need for the respondents' brief to verify or rebut them.\n5.  **The Dialectical Analysis Heuristic:** This heuristic is powerfully validated. My previous belief state, based only on the petitioner's brief, was provisional and high-risk. This observation confirms that in an adversarial system, a robust prediction is impossible without analyzing the primary arguments of both sides. The action of acquiring and analyzing the Brief in Opposition provided the highest possible information gain, fundamentally changing my model of the case from a one-sided narrative to a contested legal battle. This confirms that the most reliable path to a prediction is to map the central claims of the moving party and then seek out the direct rebuttals from the opposing party."

          "task_beliefs": "My understanding of this case has undergone a significant reversal, swinging back strongly in favor of the petitioner, BLOM Bank. The petitioner's Reply Brief has systematically dismantled the counter-arguments from the respondents' Brief in Opposition, which had previously led me to view the case as a toss-up.\n\nMy initial belief, based on the Petition for Certiorari, was that the Second Circuit had created a clear circuit split by inventing a \"balancing test\" for Rule 60(b)(6) motions and that the respondents had waived their right to amend. The Brief in Opposition effectively challenged this, suggesting a nuanced national consensus and framing the respondents' failure to amend as a reasonable choice to avoid a futile act.\n\nThe Reply Brief, however, has powerfully rehabilitated the petitioner's original arguments and exposed critical weaknesses in the respondents' position:\n\n1.  **The Circuit Split is Real, Deep, and Now Explicit:** The petitioner convincingly argues that the respondents did not resolve the split but rather ignored it. They list conflicting decisions from the First, Third, Eighth, Eleventh, and D.C. Circuits that explicitly state Rule 15(a)'s liberal amendment policy is irrelevant until the stringent requirements of Rule 60(b) are first met. Most critically, the petitioner introduces a recent Fourth Circuit case, ***Daulatzai v. Maryland*** **(2024)**, which they claim *explicitly rejects* the Second Circuit's approach and declares it is \"alone in the Nation\" in collapsing the two rules' standards. This transforms the split from a matter of interpretation into a direct, contemporary, and undeniable conflict, making the case far more compelling for Supreme Court review.\n\n2.  **The Respondents' Core Argument is a \"Category Error\":** The petitioner's most devastating point is that the respondents' entire argument\u2014and the Second Circuit's error\u2014is based on a misapplication of ***Foman v. Davis***. The petitioner clarifies that *Foman* was a **Rule 59(e)** case, which applies to motions filed within 28 days of a judgment and suspends finality. This case, in contrast, involves a **Rule 60(b)** motion, filed long after judgment became final, which attacks the judgment collaterally. Citing the Supreme Court's own recent distinction between the two rules in ***Banister v. Davis*** **(2020)**, the petitioner argues that applying the more lenient *Foman* standard to a Rule 60(b) motion is a fundamental legal error. This provides the Court with a clean, law-clarifying issue to resolve.\n\n3.  **The \"Calculated Choice\" Narrative is Revived:** The petitioner reasserts that the respondents made a \"free, calculated, deliberate\" choice not to amend, which under precedent like ***Ackermann v. United States***, forecloses relief under Rule 60(b)(6). They also counter the \"change in law\" justification by citing ***Agostini v. Felton*** for the principle that intervening developments in law rarely constitute the \"extraordinary circumstances\" required for Rule 60(b)(6) relief.\n\n4.  **The \"Poor Vehicle\" Argument is Neutralized:** The petitioner effectively refutes the claim that the case is in an \"interlocutory\" posture, noting that a final judgment exists and that an order denying a Rule 60(b) motion is itself a final, appealable order. A reversal would end the case, promoting finality.\n\nMy predictive model has now shifted dramatically back toward a **high probability of reversal**. The petitioner has successfully reframed the case as presenting a clean, critical question of federal procedure, supported by a deep and explicit circuit split, and rooted in the Second Circuit's fundamental misreading of Supreme Court precedent. The respondents' narrative, which once seemed plausible, now appears to be built on a flawed legal foundation.",
          "design_beliefs": "My strategic framework for legal prediction continues to be refined, with this observation providing crucial insights into the dynamics of cert-stage briefing.\n\n1.  **Source Prioritization:** My hierarchy is now more clearly defined: Petition for Certiorari (establishes the claim) \u2192 Brief in Opposition (provides the counter-narrative) \u2192 **Reply Brief (the decisive rebuttal and synthesis)**. The Reply Brief is not merely additive; it can be the most impactful document, as it gets the last word and can decisively re-frame the debate by exposing flaws in the opposition's arguments. Its information gain is exceptionally high.\n\n2.  **The \"Circuit Split\" Heuristic:** This is now more nuanced.\n    *   **Circuit Split Counter-Analysis:** This remains essential.\n    *   **Corollary: The \"Recency and Explicitness\" of a Split:** A claimed split is strong, but a *recent* and *explicit* split, where one circuit directly names and disagrees with another (as the 4th Circuit allegedly did in *Daulatzai*), is the gold standard for demonstrating cert-worthiness. I must now actively search for such direct, recent conflicts.\n\n3.  **Strategic Framing Analysis:** This observation demonstrates the multi-stage nature of framing. The petitioner framed a clean question; the respondent reframed it as messy; the petitioner, in the Reply, successfully reframed it *back* to a clean and fundamental legal error. The battle over the \"vehicle's\" attractiveness to the Court continues through the final brief.\n\n4.  **Iterative Information Gathering:** The claim-verification loop is confirmed and extended. The process is a three-act structure: Thesis (Petition), Antithesis (Opposition), and Synthesis (Reply). A complete understanding is not possible until the synthesis is complete.\n\n5.  **The Dialectical Analysis Heuristic:** This is powerfully validated. My provisional belief after the Brief in Opposition was correct to be uncertain. The Reply Brief demonstrates that the full strength of a petitioner's case is only revealed after it has been tested by the respondent and has an opportunity to rebut.\n\n6.  **New Heuristic: The \"Category Error\" Heuristic:** Identifying a fundamental \"category error\" in a lower court's reasoning (e.g., conflating Rule 59(e) with Rule 60(b)) is an extremely effective strategy for attracting Supreme Court review. It presents the Court with an opportunity to clarify a foundational point of law cleanly and authoritatively, which is a core part of its institutional role. I will prioritize identifying such arguments in future cases."
