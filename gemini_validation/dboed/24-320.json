    "legal_questions": [
      "When disabled combat veterans claim past-due compensation, should the military use the CRSC statute's rules to calculate how far back they can be paid, or should it use the Barring Act's six-year limit?"

      "Yes"

    "facts_of_the_case": "Simon Soto, a Marine Corps veteran with a combat-related disability, was medically retired in 2006 with less than 20 years of service. Although he became eligible for Combat-Related Special Compensation (CRSC) in 2009 when he received his disability rating, he did not apply until 2016. The Navy used the Barring Act\u2019s six-year limitation period to calculate his retroactive payments, giving him payments dating back only to 2010 instead of to 2008 when Congress had expanded CRSC eligibility to veterans with less than 20 years of service. Soto filed a class action lawsuit on behalf of himself and other similarly situated veterans who received only six years of back payments, arguing that the CRSC statute\u2019s own procedures should apply instead of the Barring Act\u2019s six-year limit.\n\nThe district court granted summary judgment to Soto\u2019s class, holding that the CRSC statute was more specific and therefore superseded the Barring Act. The court also applied the pro-veteran canon of statutory interpretation, resolving any doubt in favor of the veterans. On appeal, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit reversed.",

The Task EIG is low (0.1) because this action only structures the problem and plans the next step (finding the petitioner's brief); it does not yet provide any new facts about the case itself. The Design EIG is slightly higher (0.2) because the agent correctly identifies the key general legal principles at play (pro-veteran canon, specific vs. general statutes, textualism vs. purposivism), which is a foundational step in building a general model of SCOTUS decision-making (D).

Soto, \nand the class members he represents, are entitled to \nCombat-Related Special Compensation (\u201cCRSC\u201d)\u2014a \nmonthly benefit that Congress specifically authorized \nfor veterans who are disabled as a result of combat-\nrelated injuries incurred while serving in the United \nStates military. There is also no question that Cor-\nporal Soto is entitled to CRSC payments both going \nforward from the time his application was received and \nretroactively. The only question before this Court is \nwhether Corporal Soto may receive CRSC payments \nfor every month during which he was eligible under \nthe statute that authorizes CRSC, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1413a. \nThe government said no, contending that with respect \nto retroactive payments, Corporal Soto may obtain \nCRSC only for the six years before he applied. \nAlthough the CRSC statute imposes no time limit for \na veteran to apply for CRSC payments, the govern-\nment contends that the availability of CRSC payments \nis limited by a different statute, the Barring Act, 37 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 3702. The Barring Act is a gap-filling statute, \nauthorizing various agencies to \u201csettle\u201d an administra-\ntive claim against the United States\u2014i.e., to adminis-\ntratively determine whether the claim is valid and the \namount due\u2014in the event that no \u201c[]other law\u201d author-\nizes settlement of the claim. Id. \u00a7 3702(a). If a claim is \nsettled under the Barring Act, then it is subject to the \nBarring Act\u2019s six-year statute of limitations. Id. \n\u00a7 3702(b). But the Barring Act has no application to \nclaims for CRSC, because the CRSC statute authorizes \nsettlement of such claims. \nSpecifically, the CRSC statute authorizes the Secre-\ntaries of the military departments to determine both \nthe validity of claims for CRSC and the amount owed \n\n2 \n \nto eligible veterans\u2014all that is entailed in claims set-\ntlement. The Secretary concerned is directed to con-\nsider a veteran\u2019s application for CRSC under CRSC-\nspecific \u201cprocedures and criteria\u201d prescribed by the De-\npartment of Defense\u2014and thereby determine whether \nthe veteran is eligible for (and thus has a valid claim \nto) CRSC. 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1413a(d). The Secretary con-\ncerned is further directed to \u201cdetermine[]\u201d the monthly \namount owed to an eligible veteran using the process \nset forth in subsection (b). Id. \u00a7 1413a(a), (b). Because \nthe CRSC statute authorizes the Secretary concerned \nto determine the validity of a claim to CRSC and the \namount due, that statute specifically authorizes settle-\nment of claims like Corporal Soto\u2019s to CRSC\u2014and the \ngap-filling Barring Act accordingly has no application. \nThe judgment below should be reversed. \nDECISIONS BELOW  \nThe opinion of the Federal Circuit is reported at Soto \nv. United States, 92 F.4th 1094 (Fed. Cir. 2024), and \nreproduced at Pet. App. 1a\u201319a. The opinion of the \nSouthern District of Texas granting summary judg-\nment for petitioner is unreported, but is available at \n2021 WL 7287022, and reproduced at Pet.

The statute address-\ning Combat-Related Special Compensation, 10 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1413a, is reproduced at Pet. App. 42a. The Barring \nAct, 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3702, is reproduced at Pet. App. 45a.  \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nA. \nCombat-Related Special Compensation \n1. On December 2, 2002, Congress enacted the CRSC \nstatute to recognize and additionally compensate a se-\nlect and particularly deserving group of uniformed ser-\nvices retirees. The CRSC statute is unique in both \nwhom it serves and how it operates. In most cases, \nCongress prohibits simultaneous receipt of military re-\ntirement pay and Department of Veterans Affairs \n(\u201cVA\u201d) benefits. Congress first barred concurrent re-\nceipt of both military retirement pay and veteran\u2019s dis-\nability pension in 1891. Congressional Research Ser-\nvice, Concurrent Receipt of Military Retired Pay and \nVeteran Disability: Background and Issues for Con-\ngress (June 22, 2023), available at https://crsre-\nports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R40589/18 at 5. That \nprohibition remained in place until 1944, when Con-\ngress eased the prohibition by allowing retired mili-\ntary personnel to waive part of their retirement pay to \nreceive veteran\u2019s disability compensation. Act of May \n27, 1944, ch. 209, 58 Stat. 230, 230\u201331. This change \nwas modest, allowing some retirees to draw at least a \npartial disability benefit, which is nontaxable. Id.; 26 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 104(a)(4) & (b)(2)(D). But still, the law prohib-\nited concurrent receipt of both benefit types because it \nrequired any moneys received from veteran\u2019s disability \n\n4 \n \ncompensation to be subtracted from any retirement \nfunds received. Act of May 27, 1944, ch. 209, 58 Stat. \n230, 230\u201331. Hoping for better, veterans and advocacy \ngroups pushed for a change in law to allow receipt of \nall or some of both payments. \nIn 1999, Congress partially heeded that call. The \n1999 statute, Special Compensation for Severely Disa-\nbled Military Retirees, relaxed the prohibition on du-\nplicate benefits (also called concurrent receipt) by al-\nlowing veterans with at least 20 years of military ser-\nvice and a VA service-connected disability rated at 70 \npercent or higher to receive some monthly retirement \nbenefit. See Nat\u2019l Def. Authorization Act for Fiscal \nYear 2000, Pub. L. No. 106-65, \u00a7 658(a)(1), 113 Stat. \n512, 668\u201369 (1999). While this statute represented \nprogress, both the number of persons eligible and the \namount of compensation were minimal: the monthly \nbenefit maxed out at $300 and was available only to \nthe most severely disabled veterans. Id. \nCongress\u2019s enactment of the CRSC statute a few \nyears later represented a sea change. The program in-\ntroduced a higher cash benefit, closer to what concur-\nrent receipt would provide. However, in implementing \nthis change, Congress still saw fit to limit the benefit \nto a select group of military retirees whose service \nwrought some of the greatest sacrifices.1  \nA provision of the Bob Stump National Defense Au-\nthorization Act of 2003, the CRSC statute authorized \n \n1 Congress also enacted Concurrent Retirement and Disability \nPay (\u201cCRDP\u201d) in 2004, which allows longevity military retirees to \nreceive both military retired pay and VA disability compensation. \nNat\u2019l Def. Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2004, Pub. L. No. 108-\n136, \u00a7 641(a), 117 Stat. 1392, 1511\u201314 (2003). A veteran cannot \nreceive both CRSC and CRDP; if a veteran qualifies for both pay-\nments, the default payment will be the higher of the two.  \n\n5 \n \ncompensation to military retirees who either (1) sus-\ntained a disability that is \u201cattributable to an injury for \nwhich the member was awarded the Purple Heart\u201d and \nis assigned at least a 10% disability rating by the VA; \nor (2) had a disability rated at least 60% by the VA re-\nsulting from involvement in armed conflict, hazardous \nservice, duty simulating war, or through an instru-\nmentality of war. Bob Stump Nat\u2019l Def. Authorization \nAct for Fiscal Year 2003, Pub. L. No. 107-314, \u00a7 636, \n116 Stat. 2458, 2574\u201376 (2002) (codified as amended \nat 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1413a(e)). Since its inception, Congress \nhas amended and expanded the CRSC statute to pro-\nvide benefits to thousands of additional veterans with \ncombat-related disabilities.  \nAt first, the statute limited eligibility for CRSC to \nlongevity retirees (those who completed at least \ntwenty years of service). Pub. L. No. 107-314, \u00a7 636; 10 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 1413a(c)(1). The 2004 NDAA removed the \n60% disability rating threshold for longevity retirees. \nPub. L. No. 108-136, \u00a7 642. The 2008 NDAA further \nexpanded CRSC eligibility to anyone medically re-\ntired, including retirees with fewer than twenty years \nof service, effective January 1, 2008. Nat\u2019l Def. Author-\nization Act for Fiscal Year 2008, Pub. L. No. 110-181, \n122 Stat. 3 (2008).  \nTo be clear, the CRSC statute does not end the re-\nquirement that a retiree\u2019s military retired pay be re-\nduced by the amount of their total VA disability com-\npensation. 38 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5304, 5305. Instead, CRSC \nbeneficiaries receive \u201cspecial compensation\u201d: a partic-\nular, Congressionally authorized payment to select re-\ntirees that is in addition to whatever amount the vet-\neran is authorized to receive in military retirement \nand VA disability compensation. In contrast, a medical \nretiree who sustained a service-connected but non-\ncombat-related injury would not be eligible for such \n\n6 \n \nspecial compensation. Additionally, unlike some other \nmilitary or VA benefits, CRSC is available only to the \nveteran from the time the veteran becomes eligible to \nthe end of the veteran\u2019s life\u2014it does not extend to sur-\nviving spouses or other heirs. See 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1413a(a), \n(c).  \nThe CRSC statute stands apart as the first and only \nform of compensation that distinguishes veterans \nwounded as a result of combat. Neither VA service-\nconnected disability compensation nor longevity re-\ntirement nor medical retirement requires the veteran \nbeneficiary to suffer injury related to combat. See, e.g., \n38 U.S.C. \u00a7 1110 (VA basic entitlement\u2014time of war); \n38 U.S.C. \u00a7 1131 (VA basic entitlement\u2014peacetime); \n10 U.S.C. \u00a7 633 (longevity retirement for certain offic-\ners not recommended for promotion with 28 years of \nactive commissioned service); 10 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7  1201\u20131204 \n(military medical retirement); 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1293 (lon-\ngevity retirement for warrant officers with 20 years of \nservice); 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 12731 (reservist longevity retire-\nment). As such, the statute carves out unique benefits \nto a tailored group of retired service members whom \nlegislators singled out as particularly deserving. See \n148 Cong. Rec. S10,859 (daily ed. Nov. 13, 2002) (state-\nment of Sen. Harry Reid) (stating that the injured vet-\nerans aided by CRSC \u201cdeserve it as much as anyone \ndeserves anything in the world\u201d); id. at S10,860 (state-\nment of Sen. John Warner) (CRSC is \u201ccompensation \nfor those veterans we deemed formed that category de-\nserving of added funds\u201d). \n2. The CRSC statute provides: \u201cThe Secretary con-\ncerned shall pay to each eligible combat-related disa-\nbled uniformed services retiree who elects benefits un-\nder this section a monthly amount for the combat-re-\nlated disability of the retiree determined under \n\n7 \n \nsubsection (b).\u201d 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1413a(a).2 The statute goes \non to define how the Secretary concerned is to deter-\nmine which applicants for CRSC are eligible and how \nmuch each eligible applicant is to be paid. \nThe statutory term \u201celigible combat-related disabled \nuniformed services retiree\u201d is defined in subsection (c) \nto mean a service member who both is entitled to re-\ntired pay and has a \u201ccombat-related disability.\u201d The \nterm \u201ccombat-related disability\u201d is defined in subsec-\ntion (e) to mean a disability that is attributable to an \ninjury for which the member was awarded the Purple \nHeart or that was incurred in armed conflict, through \nan instrumentality of war, under conditions simulat-\ning war or other hazardous activity. Whether an appli-\ncant is eligible under the statutory definitions is to be \n\u201cconsidered\u201d by the Secretary concerned according to \n\u201cprocedures and criteria\u201d that the Secretary of Defense \nhas prescribed. Id. \u00a7 1413a(d); see also Joint Appendix \n(\u201cJA\u201d) 77\u2013107 (January 2004 Guidance promulgated \nby the Department of Defense pursuant to subsection \n(d));  JA 108\u2013113 (January 2008 Supplemental Guid-\nance promulgated by Department of Defense pursuant \nto subsection (d)). \nThe amount to be paid to eligible applicants is set \nforth in subsection (b) of the statute. That provision \ndetails how to determine \u201cthe monthly amount to be \npaid an eligible combat-related disabled uniformed \nservices retiree under subsection (a) for any month.\u201d \n10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1413a(b)(1). The CRSC statute thus pro-\nvides the framework for the Secretary of each military \nbranch to determine which veterans are eligible, and \n \n2 \u201cSecretary concerned\u201d is defined to mean the Secretary of the \nArmy, Navy, Air Force, or Homeland Security, depending on \nwhich branch of the armed forces is concerned. 10 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 101(a)(9). \n\n8 \n \nhow much CRSC is due to a particular eligible veteran, \nbased on the criteria and classifications provided in \nthe statute. \nCRSC is not automatic. Eligible retirees must apply \nfor the special compensation through the military \nbranch from which they retired, and must document \nthat they meet eligibility criteria. In particular, an ap-\nplicant must document not only that they have a disa-\nbility rating of 10 percent or greater, but also that their \ndisability stems from one of the qualifying  situations \nthat are classified as \u201ccombat-related.\u201d See 10 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1413a(c), (e);  JA 87\u201390 (Guidance, Federal Circuit \nDeferred Appendix \u201cAppx.\u201d 101\u201303). For example, if a \nveteran claims entitlement to CRSC based on disabil-\nity due to an injury for which the veteran was awarded \nthe Purple Heart, the veteran must provide \u201cdocumen-\ntary information that there is a sufficient causal rela-\ntionship between the disability and the injury for \nwhich a Purple Heart was awarded to conclude that \nthe disability is attributable to such injury.\u201d JA 87 \n(Guidance, Appx. 101).3 Disabilities that a veteran \n \n3 As examples of the documentation required, the Army\u2019s web-\nsite on \u201cCRSC Frequently Asked Questions\u201d states:  \nSend to CRSC copies of DD 214/215s, as well as All VA-rating \ndecisions including the VA letter, the VA rating decisions and \nthe VA code sheets, Medical Records from MTF or VA physi-\ncians only, unless referred to a private physician by the VA, \nother typical official documents include, service medical rec-\nord extracts, military personnel file extracts, milita\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

Soto, \nand the class members he represents, are entitled to \nCombat-Related Special Compensation (\u201cCRSC\u201d)\u2014a \nmonthly benefit that Congress specifically authorized \nfor veterans who are disabled as a result of combat-\nrelated injuries incurred while serving in the United \nStates military. There is also no question that Cor-\nporal Soto is entitled to CRSC payments both going \nforward from the time his application was received and \nretroactively. The only question before this Court is \nwhether Corporal Soto may receive CRSC payments \nfor every month during which he was eligible under \nthe statute that authorizes CRSC, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1413a. \nThe government said no, contending that with respect \nto retroactive payments, Corporal Soto may obtain \nCRSC only for the six years before he applied. \nAlthough the CRSC statute imposes no time limit for \na veteran to apply for CRSC payments, the govern-\nment contends that the availability of CRSC payments \nis limited by a different statute, the Barring Act, 37 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 3702. The Barring Act is a gap-filling statute, \nauthorizing various agencies to \u201csettle\u201d an administra-\ntive claim against the United States\u2014i.e., to adminis-\ntratively determine whether the claim is valid and the \namount due\u2014in the event that no \u201c[]other law\u201d author-\nizes settlement of the claim. Id. \u00a7 3702(a). If a claim is \nsettled under the Barring Act, then it is subject to the \nBarring Act\u2019s six-year statute of limitations. Id. \n\u00a7 3702(b). But the Barring Act has no application to \nclaims for CRSC, because the CRSC statute authorizes \nsettlement of such claims. \nSpecifically, the CRSC statute authorizes the Secre-\ntaries of the military departments to determine both \nthe validity of claims for CRSC and the amount owed \n\n2 \n \nto eligible veterans\u2014all that is entailed in claims set-\ntlement. The Secretary concerned is directed to con-\nsider a veteran\u2019s application for CRSC under CRSC-\nspecific \u201cprocedures and criteria\u201d prescribed by the De-\npartment of Defense\u2014and thereby determine whether \nthe veteran is eligible for (and thus has a valid claim \nto) CRSC. 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1413a(d). The Secretary con-\ncerned is further directed to \u201cdetermine[]\u201d the monthly \namount owed to an eligible veteran using the process \nset forth in subsection (b). Id. \u00a7 1413a(a), (b). Because \nthe CRSC statute authorizes the Secretary concerned \nto determine the validity of a claim to CRSC and the \namount due, that statute specifically authorizes settle-\nment of claims like Corporal Soto\u2019s to CRSC\u2014and the \ngap-filling Barring Act accordingly has no application. \nThe judgment below should be reversed. \nDECISIONS BELOW  \nThe opinion of the Federal Circuit is reported at Soto \nv. United States, 92 F.4th 1094 (Fed. Cir. 2024), and \nreproduced at Pet. App. 1a\u201319a.

App. 45a.  \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nA. \nCombat-Related Special Compensation \n1. On December 2, 2002, Congress enacted the CRSC \nstatute to recognize and additionally compensate a se-\nlect and particularly deserving group of uniformed ser-\nvices retirees. The CRSC statute is unique in both \nwhom it serves and how it operates. In most cases, \nCongress prohibits simultaneous receipt of military re-\ntirement pay and Department of Veterans Affairs \n(\u201cVA\u201d) benefits. Congress first barred concurrent re-\nceipt of both military retirement pay and veteran\u2019s dis-\nability pension in 1891. Congressional Research Ser-\nvice, Concurrent Receipt of Military Retired Pay and \nVeteran Disability: Background and Issues for Con-\ngress (June 22, 2023), available at https://crsre-\nports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R40589/18 at 5. That \nprohibition remained in place until 1944, when Con-\ngress eased the prohibition by allowing retired mili-\ntary personnel to waive part of their retirement pay to \nreceive veteran\u2019s disability compensation. Act of May \n27, 1944, ch. 209, 58 Stat. 230, 230\u201331. This change \nwas modest, allowing some retirees to draw at least a \npartial disability benefit, which is nontaxable. Id.; 26 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 104(a)(4) & (b)(2)(D). But still, the law prohib-\nited concurrent receipt of both benefit types because it \nrequired any moneys received from veteran\u2019s disability \n\n4 \n \ncompensation to be subtracted from any retirement \nfunds received. Act of May 27, 1944, ch. 209, 58 Stat. \n230, 230\u201331. Hoping for better, veterans and advocacy \ngroups pushed for a change in law to allow receipt of \nall or some of both payments. \nIn 1999, Congress partially heeded that call. The \n1999 statute, Special Compensation for Severely Disa-\nbled Military Retirees, relaxed the prohibition on du-\nplicate benefits (also called concurrent receipt) by al-\nlowing veterans with at least 20 years of military ser-\nvice and a VA service-connected disability rated at 70 \npercent or higher to receive some monthly retirement \nbenefit. See Nat\u2019l Def. Authorization Act for Fiscal \nYear 2000, Pub. L. No. 106-65, \u00a7 658(a)(1), 113 Stat. \n512, 668\u201369 (1999). While this statute represented \nprogress, both the number of persons eligible and the \namount of compensation were minimal: the monthly \nbenefit maxed out at $300 and was available only to \nthe most severely disabled veterans. Id. \nCongress\u2019s enactment of the CRSC statute a few \nyears later represented a sea change. The program in-\ntroduced a higher cash benefit, closer to what concur-\nrent receipt would provide. However, in implementing \nthis change, Congress still saw fit to limit the benefit \nto a select group of military retirees whose service \nwrought some of the greatest sacrifices.1  \nA provision of the Bob Stump National Defense Au-\nthorization Act of 2003, the CRSC statute authorized \n \n1 Congress also enacted Concurrent Retirement and Disability \nPay (\u201cCRDP\u201d) in 2004, which allows longevity military retirees to \nreceive both military retired pay and VA disability compensation. \nNat\u2019l Def. Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2004, Pub. L. No. 108-\n136, \u00a7 641(a), 117 Stat. 1392, 1511\u201314 (2003). A veteran cannot \nreceive both CRSC and CRDP; if a veteran qualifies for both pay-\nments, the default payment will be the higher of the two.  \n\n5 \n \ncompensation to military retirees who either (1) sus-\ntained a disability that is \u201cattributable to an injury for \nwhich the member was awarded the Purple Heart\u201d and \nis assigned at least a 10% disability rating by the VA; \nor (2) had a disability rated at least 60% by the VA re-\nsulting from involvement in armed conflict, hazardous \nservice, duty simulating war, or through an instru-\nmentality of war. Bob Stump Nat\u2019l Def. Authorization \nAct for Fiscal Year 2003, Pub. L. No. 107-314, \u00a7 636, \n116 Stat. 2458, 2574\u201376 (2002) (codified as amended \nat 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1413a(e)). Since its inception, Congress \nhas amended and expanded the CRSC statute to pro-\nvide benefits to thousands of additional veterans with \ncombat-related disabilities.  \nAt first, the statute limited eligibility for CRSC to \nlongevity retirees (those who completed at least \ntwenty years of service). Pub. L. No. 107-314, \u00a7 636; 10 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 1413a(c)(1). The 2004 NDAA removed the \n60% disability rating threshold for longevity retirees. \nPub. L. No. 108-136, \u00a7 642. The 2008 NDAA further \nexpanded CRSC eligibility to anyone medically re-\ntired, including retirees with fewer than twenty years \nof service, effective January 1, 2008. Nat\u2019l Def. Author-\nization Act for Fiscal Year 2008, Pub. L. No. 110-181, \n122 Stat. 3 (2008).  \nTo be clear, the CRSC statute does not end the re-\nquirement that a retiree\u2019s military retired pay be re-\nduced by the amount of their total VA disability com-\npensation. 38 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5304, 5305. Instead, CRSC \nbeneficiaries receive \u201cspecial compensation\u201d: a partic-\nular, Congressionally authorized payment to select re-\ntirees that is in addition to whatever amount the vet-\neran is authorized to receive in military retirement \nand VA disability compensation. In contrast, a medical \nretiree who sustained a service-connected but non-\ncombat-related injury would not be eligible for such \n\n6 \n \nspecial compensation. Additionally, unlike some other \nmilitary or VA benefits, CRSC is available only to the \nveteran from the time the veteran becomes eligible to \nthe end of the veteran\u2019s life\u2014it does not extend to sur-\nviving spouses or other heirs. See 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1413a(a), \n(c).  \nThe CRSC statute stands apart as the first and only \nform of compensation that distinguishes veterans \nwounded as a result of combat. Neither VA service-\nconnected disability compensation nor longevity re-\ntirement nor medical retirement requires the veteran \nbeneficiary to suffer injury related to combat. See, e.g., \n38 U.S.C. \u00a7 1110 (VA basic entitlement\u2014time of war); \n38 U.S.C. \u00a7 1131 (VA basic entitlement\u2014peacetime); \n10 U.S.C. \u00a7 633 (longevity retirement for certain offic-\ners not recommended for promotion with 28 years of \nactive commissioned service); 10 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7  1201\u20131204 \n(military medical retirement); 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1293 (lon-\ngevity retirement for warrant officers with 20 years of \nservice); 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 12731 (reservist longevity retire-\nment). As such, the statute carves out unique benefits \nto a tailored group of retired service members whom \nlegislators singled out as particularly deserving. See \n148 Cong. Rec. S10,859 (daily ed. Nov. 13, 2002) (state-\nment of Sen. Harry Reid) (stating that the injured vet-\nerans aided by CRSC \u201cdeserve it as much as anyone \ndeserves anything in the world\u201d); id. at S10,860 (state-\nment of Sen. John Warner) (CRSC is \u201ccompensation \nfor those veterans we deemed formed that category de-\nserving of added funds\u201d). \n2. The CRSC statute provides: \u201cThe Secretary con-\ncerned shall pay to each eligible combat-related disa-\nbled uniformed services retiree who elects benefits un-\nder this section a monthly amount for the combat-re-\nlated disability of the retiree determined under \n\n7 \n \nsubsection (b).\u201d 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1413a(a).2 The statute goes \non to define how the Secretary concerned is to deter-\nmine which applicants for CRSC are eligible and how \nmuch each eligible applicant is to be paid. \nThe statutory term \u201celigible combat-related disabled \nuniformed services retiree\u201d is defined in subsection (c) \nto mean a service member who both is entitled to re-\ntired pay and has a \u201ccombat-related disability.\u201d The \nterm \u201ccombat-related disability\u201d is defined in subsec-\ntion (e) to mean a disability that is attributable to an \ninjury for which the member was awarded the Purple \nHeart or that was incurred in armed conflict, through \nan instrumentality of war, under conditions simulat-\ning war or other hazardous activity. Whether an appli-\ncant is eligible under the statutory definitions is to be \n\u201cconsidered\u201d by the Secretary concerned according to \n\u201cprocedures and criteria\u201d that the Secretary of Defense \nhas prescribed.

That provision \ndetails how to determine \u201cthe monthly amount to be \npaid an eligible combat-related disabled uniformed \nservices retiree under subsection (a) for any month.\u201d \n10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1413a(b)(1).

Eligible retirees must apply \nfor the special compensation through the military \nbranch from which they retired, and must document \nthat they meet eligibility criteria. In particular, an ap-\nplicant must document not only that they have a disa-\nbility rating of 10 percent or greater, but also that their \ndisability stems from one of the qualifying  situations \nthat are classified as \u201ccombat-related.\u201d See 10 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1413a(c), (e);  JA 87\u201390 (Guidance, Federal Circuit \nDeferred Appendix \u201cAppx.\u201d 101\u201303). For example, if a \nveteran claims entitlement to CRSC based on disabil-\nity due to an injury for which the veteran was awarded \nthe Purple Heart, the veteran must provide \u201cdocumen-\ntary information that there is a sufficient causal rela-\ntionship between the disability and the injury for \nwhich a Purple Heart was awarded to conclude that \nthe disability is attributable to such injury.\u201d JA 87 \n(Guidance, Appx. 101).3 Disabilities that a veteran \n \n3 As examples of the documentation required, the Army\u2019s web-\nsite on \u201cCRSC Frequently Asked Questions\u201d states:  \nSend to CRSC copies of DD 214/215s, as well as All VA-rating \ndecisions including the VA letter, the VA rating decisions and \nthe VA code sheets, Medical Records from MTF or VA physi-\ncians only, unless referred to a private physician by the VA, \nother typical official documents include, service medical rec-\nord extracts, military personnel file extracts, military person-\nnel data system printouts, prior military disability board de-\ncisions, line of duty determinations, safety mishap (accident) \nreports, next of kin notification (Western Union Telegrams), \ncasualty reports, morning reports, duty status reports, or-\nder/travel voucher, official documents not in the military per-\nsonnel record, etc. Be sure to retain a copy for Soldier's rec-\nords. \nU.S. Army Hum.

Soto served honorably in the \nUnited States Marine Corps from 2000 to 2006. Pet. \nApp. 22a. During that time, he served two tours of ac-\ntive combat duty in Operation Iraqi Freedom. JA 15 \n\u00b6 53. During his first tour, Corporal Soto\u2019s unit served \nin Mortuary Affairs. Id. \u00b6 54. Mortuary Affairs opera-\ntions oversee the collection and dignified transfer of \nthe remains of fallen soldiers. Those serving in an \noverseas Mortuary Affairs unit, as Corporal Soto did, \nare responsible for entering into combat zones to re-\ntrieve their fallen comrades, identifying them, and \npreparing them for reunification with their surviving \nloved ones.

Members of the unit place \ntheir own bodies in harm\u2019s way to ensure that no sol-\ndier, living or deceased, is left behind on the battle-\nfield. As such, service in a Mortuary Affairs unit is \nsimultaneously physically dangerous and emotionally \ntaxing. Studies show that mortuary affairs personnel \nexperience some of the highest rates of Post-Traumatic \nStress Disorder (\u201cPTSD\u201d) in the service, due to the \ngruesome nature of the assignment, the emotional link \nbetween the soldier and the fallen, and the persistent \nphysical threats endured by the member of the unit. \nMichael Sledge, Soldier Dead: How We Recover, Iden-\ntify, Bury, and Honor Our Military Fallen 61 (2005), \nhttps://www.jstor.org/stable/10.7312/sled13514.6.  \nCorporal Soto\u2019s experience reflects this. While de-\nployed, Corporal Soto witnessed daily atrocities as he \nwent out to \u201csearch for, recover, and process the re-\nmains\u201d of war casualties. JA 15 \u00b6 54. Whenever his \nMortuary Affairs unit received a report of casualties, \nmembers of the unit would go out and place any recov-\nered remains in plastic or body bags and transport \nthem to the military base for identification and reloca-\ntion to the United States. Id. Corporal Soto recalls one \nmission in which he and other service members re-\ntrieved \u201cover 300 pieces of five or seven soldiers\u201d who \nhad been killed. Id. at 15\u201316 \u00b6 55. As Corporal Soto \nrelated,  \u201cit wasn\u2019t really easy to identify who and it \nwas just literally chunks and pieces of flesh that we \nwere processing.\u201d Id.  \nWhile serving, Corporal Soto began having suicidal \nthoughts, vivid nightmares, and difficulty concentrat-\ning as a result of his experiences in Mortuary Affairs. \nJA 16 \u00b6 56. After deployment, Corporal Soto found ad-\njustment to civilian life incredibly difficult. Id. His \nphysicians documented the correlation between his \n\n11 \n \ndistressing combat experiences in Iraq and his later \ndiagnosis of PTSD. Id. \u00b6 57. \nBecause Corporal Soto\u2019s PTSD rendered him \u201cunfit\u201d \nto continue his service, he was placed on the Tempo-\nrary Disability Retirement List (\u201cTDRL\u201d), and medi-\ncally retired from the Marine Corps on April 28, 2006. \nPet. App. 22a. This entitled him to military retirement \npay. Id. In recognition of his honorable service, the mil-\nitary awarded Corporal Soto numerous medals and \ncommendations, including the Army Commendation \nMedal, which is awarded to members of the Armed \nForces who \u201cdistinguish themselves by heroism, out-\nstanding achievement, or meritorious service\u201d; the \nNavy \nand \nMarine \nCorps \nAchievement \nMedal, \n\u201cawarded for meritorious service or achievement in ei-\nther combat or noncombat based on sustained perfor-\nmance or specific achievement of a superlative na-\nture;\u201d the Iraqi Campaign Medal, and the Global War \non Terrorism Service Medal.

Subsequently, Corporal Soto was removed \nfrom the TDRL and given permanent disability retire-\nment, which continued his entitlement to military re-\ntirement pay. Id. at 16 \u00b6 58.  \nCorporal Soto then sought service-connected disabil-\nity benefits from the VA for his PTSD. Id. \u00b6 59. In June \n2009, the VA issued a rating decision awarding him a \ndisability rating of 50 percent for his PTSD (effective \nApril 26, 2006), followed by a rating of 30 percent (ef-\nfective November 1, 2006), and then a rating of 100 \npercent (effective December 31, 2008). Id. A rating of \n100 percent means the VA concluded Corporal Soto \n\n12 \n \nexhibited \u201cTotal occupational and social impairment \ndue to such symptoms as: gross impairment in thought \nprocesses or communication; persistent delusions or \nhallucinations; grossly inappropriate behavior; persis-\ntent danger of hurting self or others; intermittent ina-\nbility to perform activities of daily living (including \nmaintenance of minimal personal hygiene); disorien-\ntation to time or place; memory loss for names of close \nrelatives, own occupation, or own name.\u201d  38 C.F.R. \u00a7 \n4.130 (General Rating Formula for Mental Disorders, \nDC 9411 (PTSD)). \nAgainst this backdrop of devastating symptoms, in \nJune 2016, Corporal Soto petitioned the Navy seeking \nCRSC based on his combat-related PTSD. Pet. App. \n22a. In October 2016, the Navy affirmed that Corporal \nSoto was eligible, finding that his PTSD was a combat-\nrelated disability and awarding him CRSC. Id. How-\never, the Navy assigned a CRSC effective date of July \n2010, Pet. App. 4a, notwithstanding the fact that Cor-\nporal Soto met all of the CRSC eligibility criteria as of \nJanuary 1, 2008\u2014the effective date of the 2008 NDAA, \nwhich as explained above, had extended CRSC to med-\nical retirees such as Corporal Soto. JA 17 \u00b6 61. See 10 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 1413a(b)(3)(B). As a result, the Secretary of \nthe Navy awarded him only six years of retroactive \nCRSC (from July 2010 to June 2016), not eight-and-\none-half years of retroactive CRSC (from January \n2008 until June 2016). JA 17 \u00b6\u00b6 61\u201362.  \nThe Secretary of the Navy explained its restriction \nof Corporal Soto\u2019s payment as follows:  \nCRSC is subject to the 6-year statute of \nlimitations United States Code (U.S.C.) \n31, Section 3702(b). In order to receive \nthe full retroactive CRSC entitlement, \nyou must file your CRSC claim within 6 \nyears of any VA rating decision that could \n\n13 \n \npotentially make you eligible for CRSC or \nthe date you became entitled to retired \npay, whichever is most recent. If you file \nyour claim more than 6 years after initial \neligibility, you will be restricted to 6 \nyears of any retroactive entitlement.  \nJA 11 \u00b6 35 (brackets in original). Through the Secre-\ntaries of the military branches, the United States has \nused this six-year statute of limitations policy to pay \nno more than six years of retroactive CRSC to thou-\nsands of other United States military combat veterans \nentitled to CRSC.  \nC. \nThe proceedings below \nOn March 2, 2017, Corporal Soto brought this action \nin the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of \nTexas on behalf of a class of U.S. military veterans \nwho, like him, are eligible for CRSC due to significant \ndisabilities they incurred through combat injuries. The \nsuit asserted a single claim pursuant to 10 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1413a (referred to above as the \u201cCRSC statute\u201d) \nbased on the United States\u2019 \u201cnationwide and unlawful \npolicy to pay no more than six years of retroactive \nCRSC \u201d JA 1. The proposed nationwide class consisted \nof:  \n[f]ormer service members of the \nUnited States Army, Navy, Marine \nCorps, Air Force, or Coast Guard \nwhose CRSC applications under 10 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 1413a were granted, but \nwhose amount of CRSC payment was \nlimited by Defendant\u2019s application of \nthe statute of limitations contained in \n31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3702 and have a claim \nless than $10,000. \n\n14 \n \nPet.

For J. on the \nPleadings, No. 1:17-cv-00051 (S.D. Tex. Aug. 31, 2017), \nDkt. 39. The court first recognized that \u201c[e]ntitlement \nto CRSC is set forth by statute in 10 U.S.C. \u00a71413a, \nwhich grants the Secretary concerned the authority to \npay an \u2018eligible combat-related disabled uniformed ser-\nvices retiree\u2019 a monthly amount of benefits for the com-\nbat-related disability.\u201d Id. at 5. It then reasoned, \u201c[t]he \nCourt is aware of no legal basis to conclude that Con-\ngress intended any other statute to govern CRSC \nclaims.\u201d Id. In particular, the Barring Act could not su-\npersede the mechanism for awarding CRSC within the \nCRSC statute. While the Barring Act is \u201ca \u2018general act\u2019 \napplicable to a multitude of uniformed service mem-\nbers\u2019 claims,\u201d the CRSC statute is a \u201c\u2018specific act\u2019 stat-\nute,\u201d the detailed provisions of which \u201ctake[] prece-\ndence over\u201d the Barring Act. Id.  \nThe District Court later certified the proposed class \non February 11, 2019. Pet. App. 31a. The government \nidentified 9,108 former service members whose retro-\nactive CRSC had been limited by application of the \nBarring Act.4 JA 71. \nThe District Court granted summary judgment to \nCorporal Soto on December 16, 2021. Pet. App. 38a\u2013\n39a. The court held that the CRSC statute separately \nauthorizes settlement of claims for CRSC \u201cbecause it \ndefines eligibility for CRSC, helps explain the amount \nof benefits and instructs the Secretary of Defense to \n \n4 The number of class members described above is based on in-\nformation provided by the government pulled from the list of \nCRSC recipients as of August 5, 2019.

App. 35a\u201336a. Accordingly, the \ncourt held that the CRSC statute is \u201canother law,\u201d dis-\nplacing the Barring Act and its six-year statute of lim-\nitations. Pet. App. 35a. The court entered final judg-\nment in favor of Corporal Soto and the class, finding \nthe government liable to the veterans for compensa-\ntion withheld when applying the Barring Act. Pet. \nApp. 38a\u201339a.  \nOn appeal, the Federal Circuit reversed the District \nCourt in a split decision. Pet. App. 11a. The majority \nheld that the Barring Act was not displaced\u2014and that \nits statute of limitations applied to limit the CRSC \navailable to Corporal Soto and the class\u2014based on its \nconclusion that the CRSC statute \u201cconveys no\u201d settle-\nment authority. Id. at 7a. According to the Federal Cir-\ncuit, in order to displace the Barring Act a statute \n\u201cmust explicitly grant an agency or entity the author-\nity to settle claims\u201d using \u201cspecific language,\u201d which \nthe majority stated \u201cwill typically be done by the use \nof the term \u2018settle\u2019.\u201d Id. at 6a\u20137a. Because the CRSC \nstatute does not \u201cmention[] settlement,\u201d the Federal \nCircuit concluded that \u201cit only establishes who may be \neligible for CRSC payments, not how claimants can \nhave those claims settled.\u201d Id.  \nThe majority separately held that \u201c[w]ithout specific \nlanguage authorizing the Secretary of Defense to settle \na claim[,] . . . the CRSC statute cannot displace the \nBarring Act, unless another statute provides a \u2018spe-\ncific\u2019 provision setting out the period of recovery.\u201d Pet. \nApp. 7a. The majority concluded that \u201cthe CRSC stat-\nute does not meet either of those requirements.\u201d Id.  \nJudge Reyna dissented. Pet. App. 12a. First, he ex-\nplained, \u201cthere is no dispute in this case\u201d that \u201c\u2018[s]et-\ntling a claim\u2019 . . . means administratively determining \nthe validity of the demand for money against the \n\n16 \n \ngovernment and the amount of money due.\u201d Id. at 12a\u2013\n13a. Here, he wrote, \u201cthe CRSC statute permits the \ngovernment to administratively determine the validity \nof a veteran\u2019s demand for CRSC, as well as the amount \nof CRSC due to the veteran in retroactive and future \nmonthly compensation. In light of these provisions, the \nBarring Act does not apply.\u201d Id. at 13a\u201314a.  \nIn particular, the statute \u201cdefines eligible retirees,\u201d \nthus allowing for the determination of \u201cwhether they \nhave a right to demand money under the statute\u2014that \nis, whether they have a \u2018claim.\u2019\u201d Pet. App. 14a. Fur-\nther, \u201cthe CRSC statute describes how the Secretary \nmust determine the \u2018monthly amount to be paid.\u2019\u201d Id. \nat 15a (quoting 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1413a(b)(1)). \u201cBy these \ncommon and plain terms, the CRSC statute specifies \nthe \u2018settlement\u2019 of a \u2018claim\u2019 against the government. It \ntherefore takes precedence over the Barring Act.\u201d Id. \nat 15a\u201316a. \nJudge Reyna went on to criticize the majority\u2019s de-\nmand for \u201c\u2018specific language\u2019\u201d before a statute could be \nread to authorize claims settlement as \u201cunprece-\ndented\u201d: \n[T]he long-understood meaning of \u201csettling\u201d a \n\u201cclaim\u201d against the government includes no such \nlimitations. Raising these new requirements, the \nmajority also raises the bar to a new and unprec-\nedented standard for what a statute must state to \nsupersede the Barring Act. Although a statute in-\nvolving resolution of conflict may \u201ctypically\u201d use \nthe words \u201csettle\u201d and \u201cclaim,\u201d the majority does \nnot explain why this phrasing should be \u201ctypical\u201d \nfor statutes that involve a more general, remedial, \nadministrative determination of eligibility for \nmoney from the government and the amount due. \nAnd the majority\u2019s alternative requirement\u2014that \na statute state a \u201cspecific\u201d period of recovery\u2014\n\n17 \n \nrequires a level of specificity in statutory lan-\nguage that finds no support in our canons of stat-\nutory interpretation.    \nPet. App. 18a.  \n\u201c[I]n rendering this decision,\u201d Judge Reyna wrote, \n\u201cthe majority denies benefits to a highly-deserving \nclass of veterans seeking compensation granted by \nstatute for combat-related injuries incurred in service \nto this country.\u201d Pet. App. 19a. \nSUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT  \nBefore an administrative claim for compensation \nfrom the United States may be paid, the claim must be \n\u201csettled.\u201d This Court has long held, and the parties \nagree, that to \u201csettle\u201d a claim in this context means to \nadministratively determine whether the claim is valid \nand how much is owed. As the entity with ultimate \ncontrol over use of U.S. funds, Congress determines \nwhich agency within the U.S. government has author-\nity to settle which claims.  \nIn the founding era, when far fewer administrative \nclaims were pursued against the United States, Con-\ngress lodged settlement authority exclusively with the \nTreasury Department. But in the subsequent two cen-\nturies, as the number of statutes authorizing ad-min-\nistrative claims against the government has prolifer-\nated, settlement authority has been broadly delegated, \nwith numerous agencies deemed authorized to settle \nvarious claims. In addition, Congress has enacted the \nBarring Act to act as a gap-filler: If a claim is pre-\nsented and no other statute authorizes a specific \nagency to settle it, then the Barring Act kicks in by \ndefault, and details which agency should settle which \ntype of claim.  \n\n18 \n \nThe question before the Court is whether the statute \ndirecting the Secretaries of the military branches to \npay CRSC to eligible veterans authorizes settlement of \nCRSC claims\u2014or, in the alternative, whether such \nclaims are subject to the Barring Act (and its six-year \nstatute of limitations) by default. The text of the CRSC \nmakes the answer plain. That statute on its face au-\nthorizes the Secretary concerned to determine \nwhether a veteran is eligible for (and thus has a valid \nclaim to) CRSC, and what amount of CRSC should be \npaid. The Barring Act has no application here. \nFirst, as to determining eligibility, the statute states \nthat \u201ca disabled uniformed services retiree may apply \nto the Secretary of a military department to be consid-\nered to be an eligible combat-related disabled uni-\nformed services retiree,\u201d with the Secretary\u2019s \u201cconsid-\neration\u201d of the application to be conducted according to \nCRSC-specific \u201cprocedures and criteria\u201d to be pre-\nscribed by the Secretary of Defense. 10 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1413a(d). Upon consideration of the claimant\u2019s appli-\ncation, the Secretary concerned is directed to \u201cpay\u201d \nCRSC \u201cto each eligible combat-related disabled uni-\nformed services retiree.\u201d Id. \u00a7 1413a(a). As to deter-\nmining the amount owed, the statute states that the \nSecretary concerned shall pay \u201ca monthly amount for \nthe combat-related disability of the retiree determined \nunder subsection (b).\u201d Id. Subsection (b), in turn, de-\ntails precisely how the Secretary is to make the requi-\nsite \u201cdetermination.\u201d Id. \u00a7 1413(b)(1) (titled \u201cdetermi-\nnation of monthly amount\u201d). \nIn short, the plain statutory text directs the Secre-\ntary concerned to determine both the validity of a vet-\neran\u2019s claim to CRSC and the amount owed. The CRSC \nstatute therefore confers settlement authority, and the \nBarring Act does not apply. \n\n19 \n \nThe Federal Circuit reached a different conclusion \nby applying a novel, anti-settlement canon of construc-\ntion. According to that court, a statute should not be \nconstrued to grant settlement authority unless it uses \n\u201cspecific language\u201d (\u201ctypically . . . the term \u2018settle,\u2019\u201d ac-\ncording to the Federal Circuit), or imposes an explicit \nstatute of limitations. Pet. App. 7a. Neither require-\nment holds water. \nFirst, statutory history and this Court\u2019s precedents \nconfirm that settlement authority exists whenever an \nagency has authority to administratively determine \nthe validity and amount of a claim, regardless of the \nparticular terms used. No authority supports the Fed-\neral Circuit\u2019s \u201cspecific language\u201d requirement\u2014and \nthis Court\u2019s case law teaches away from interpreting \nstatutes based on the presence or absence of \u201cmagic \nwords.\u201d To the extent any canon of construction was \napplied here, the Federal Circuit should have applied \nthe veterans canon\u2014which was widely accepted, and \npresumably known to Congress, at the time the CRSC \nstatute was enacted.  \nAdditionally, the statutory text squarely refutes the \nFederal Circuit\u2019s conclusion that (because it does not \nuse the word \u201csettle\u201d) the CRSC statute \u201conly estab-\nlishes who may be eligible for CRSC payments.\u201d Pet. \nApp. 7a. The statute on its face authorizes the Secre-\ntary concerned to determine eligibility and amount \ndue, and to pay CRSC claims\u2014distinguishing it from \nother military compensation statutes that, unlike the \nCRSC statute, address only an individual\u2019s entitle-\nment to pay, and not the Secretary\u2019s authority to settle \nclaims and make payment on them. \nFinally, the Federal Circuit\u2019s suggestion that the \nCRSC statute must impose a statute of limitations to \ndisplace the Barring Act is inconsistent with the text \nof the Barring Act. The text makes clear that the \n\n20 \n \nBarring Act\u2014all of it, including its statute of limita-\ntions\u2014does not apply to a claim if \u201canother law\u201d pro-\nvides for settlement, without regard to whether the \nother law also includes a statute of limitations. 31 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 3702(a)\u2013(b). Indeed, the absence of a statute \nof limitations on CRSC claims makes perfect sense \ngiven how the CRSC statute operates. CRSC becomes \navailable only after a veteran is retired from the mili-\ntary, and is awarded only during the veteran\u2019s life-\ntime, and not to the veteran\u2019s heirs. Further, interest \nis not available on retroactive CRSC payments. Given \nthese constraints\u2014and the obstacles that disabling \ncombat-related injuries may pose to a veteran\u2019s ability \nto complete the CRSC application process\u2014it is unsur-\nprising that Congress chose to make CRSC payments \navailable for the entire period of a veteran\u2019s eligibility. \nThe decision below should be reversed. \nARGUMENT  \nI. \nTHE CRSC STATUTE AUTHORIZES SET-\nTLEMENT OF CLAIMS FOR CRSC AND \nTHUS DISPLACES THE BARRING ACT. \nThe Federal Circuit held that claims for CRSC must \nbe settled under the Barring Act\u2014and are accordingly \nsubject to the Barring Act\u2019s six-year statute of limita-\ntions\u2014based on its conclusion that the CRSC statute \ndoes not authorize settlement of claims for CRSC. Pet. \nApp. 7a. The Federal Circuit was incorrect. Settlement \nauthority exists if a statute authorizes an agency to \nadministratively determine the validity of a claim and \nthe amount due. The CRSC statute authorizes the Sec-\nretaries of the military departments to administra-\ntively determine both whether an applicant is eligible \nfor (i.e., has a valid claim to) CRSC, and what amount \nof CRSC the applicant is entitled to. Because the \nCRSC statute authorizes settlement of CRSC claims, \n\n21 \n \nit is \u201canother law\u201d that displaces the Barring Act, see \n31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3702(a), and neither the Barring Act\u2019s set-\ntlement procedures nor its statute of limitations ap-\nplies to claims for CRSC. \nA. An agency has settlement authority if a \nstatute authorizes it to administratively \ndetermine the validity of a claim and the \namount due. \n1. Congress has widely authorized agen-\ncies to settle claims against the United \nStates. \nThe Constitution grants Congress exclusive author-\nity to \u201cpay the Debts\u201d of the United States, and to \u201cdis-\npose of and make all needful Rules and Regulations \nrespecting the Territory or other Property belonging to \nthe United States.\u201d U.S. Const. art. I, \u00a7 8, cl. 1; id. art. \nIV \u00a7 3, cl. 2. Further, \u201cNo Money shall be drawn from \nthe Treasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations \nmade by Law.\u201d Id., art. I, \u00a7 9, cl. 7. Accordingly, for a \nclaimant to obtain payment from the United States, \nCongress must have authorized both acceptance of the \nclaim and payment using appropriated funds. See, e.g., \nUnited States v. Corliss Steam-Engine Co., 91 U.S. \n321, 322 (1875) (power to settle and pay claims on be-\nhalf of the United States is \u201climited by the legislation \nof Congress\u201d); U.S. Gov\u2019t Accountability Off., GAO-08-\n978SP, Principles of Federal Appropriations Law 14-\n2\u201314-3 (3d ed. 2008) (\u201cGAO Red Book\u201d) (\u201c[C]laims \nagainst the United States may not be approved, \u2026 and \nappropriated funds (or other resources) may not be \nused to satisfy claims against the United States, un-\nless there is constitutional and/or statutory authority \nthat both allows the claim to be pursued and makes \nfunds (or other resources, available for that purpose.\u201d). \n\n22 \n \nThe first step in this process\u2014determining that a \nclaimant has a valid claim against the United States, \nand what amount is owed on such claim\u2014is often (but \nnot exclusively) referred to as \u201csettlement.\u201d \u201cThe word \n\u2018settlement,\u2019 in connection with public transactions \nand accounts, has been used from the beginning to de-\nscribe administrative determination of the amount \ndue.\u201d Ill. Sur. Co. v. United States, 240 U.S. 214, 219 \n(1916). Specifically, the authority \u201cto settle and adjust\u201d \na claim against the United States is the authority \u201cto \ndetermine upon the validity of\u201d the claim and the \namount owed on it. Id. at 219\u201320 (emphasis omitted) \n(quoting Cooke v. United States, 91 U.S. 389, 399 \n(1875)).5 And this Court has made clear that settlement \nof a claim is a distinct step that precedes payment of a \nclaim. See id. at 218\u201319 (statutory term \u201csettlement\u201d \nof claims could not be interpreted to \u201cdenote payment\u201d \nof claims); Cooke, 91 U.S. at 399\u2013400 (assistant-treas-\nurer was authorized to make payments using appro-\npriated funds, but had \u201cno authority to settle and ad-\njust, that is to say, to determine upon the validity of, \nany claim against the government\u201d).  \nNotably, the term \u201csettlement,\u201d when used to denote \nadministrative processing of a claim, does not have the \nsame meaning as when that term is used in litigation. \n\u201c[T]he term \u2018settlement\u2019 in the litigation context means \ncompromise.\u201d Off. of Gen. Counsel, GAO, Principles of \nFederal Appropriations Law 11-6 (1st ed. 1982). But \nthe authority to administratively  \nsettle and adjust claims does not . . . include the \n \n5 A \u201cclaim\u201d in this context is \u201ca right to demand money from the \nUnited States . . . which can be presented by the claimant to some \ndepartment or officer of the United States for payment, or may be \nprosecuted in the court of claims.\u201d Hobbs v. McLean, 117 U.S. 567, \n575 (1886). \n\n23 \n \nauthority to compromise claims. In the context of \npayment claims, the rationale for this is simply \nthat a claim determined to be valid should be paid \nin full. Likewise, public funds should not be used \nto pay any part of a claim determined not to be \nvalid. Thus, the authority to compromise a given \nclaim against the United States depends on the \nexistence of statutory authority above and beyond \nthe authority to \u201csettle and adjust\u201d claims of that \ntype. \nId. (citations omitted). This long-established use of the \nterm \u201csettlement\u201d\u2014to mean administrative determi-\nnation of the validity of a claim and amount due\u2014con-\ntinues to this day. See, e.g., Adams v. Hinchman, 154 \nF.3d 420, 422 (D.C. Cir. 1998) (per curiam) (citing Ill. \nSur. and holding: \u201cto settle a claim means to adminis-\ntratively determine the validity of that claim\u201d) (quot-\ning Off. of Gen. Counsel, GAO, Principles of Federal \nAppropriations Law 11-6); Paige v. United States, 159 \nFed. Cl. 383, 386 (2022); Devlin v. Berry, 26 F. Supp. \n3d 74, 79 (D.D.C. 2014). Relevant here, \u201cthere is no dis-\npute in this case regarding what it means to \u2018settle\u2019 \nsuch a claim.\u201d Pet. App. 12a (Reyna, J., dissenting); see \nalso Brief for Appellant at 29-30, Soto v. United States, \nNo. 2022\u20132011 (Fed. Cir. Oct. 12, 2022); Pet. App. 3a \nn.1. \nIn the earliest days of the republic, Congress re-\ntained authority to settle claims, and itself \u201cadjudi-\ncate[d] each individual money claim against the \nUnited States.\u201d Off. of Pers. Mgmt. v. Richmond, 496 \nU.S. 414, 430 (1990). As the nation grew and the need \nfor timely processing of claims increased following the \nRevolutionary War, Congress in 1789 established the \nTreasury Department, and granted it authority to \n\u201csettle\u201d and \u201caudit\u201d accounts on behalf of the United \nStates. An Act to Establish the Treasury Department, \n\n24 \n \nch. XII, 1 Stat. 65, 66\u201367 (1789). Shortly thereafter, in \n1817, Congress expanded this delegation, legislating \nthat \u201call claims and demands whatever, by the United \nStates or against them, and all accounts whatever, in \nwhich the United States are concerned, either as debt-\nors or as creditors, shall be settled and adjusted in the \nTreasury Department.\u201d An Act to Provide for the \nPrompt Settlement of Public Accounts, ch. XLV, \u00a7 2, 3 \nStat. 366, 366 \u00a7 2 (1817).   \nIn this early period, reviewing and paying claims \nagainst the United States was \u201cmuch simpler,\u201d be-\ncause Congress had not yet authorized many claims, \nand \u201cthe possibility of obtaining redress for claims \nagainst the government was limited.\u201d GAO Red Book \nat 14-20\u201314-21. In the subsequent two centuries, how-\never, \u201c[t]he law has undergone a sea change,\u201d with the \nnumber of statutes authorizing claims against the gov-\nernment proliferating. Id. at 14\u201321. \u201cNow, there are \nmany statutes that, in varying degrees of detail, waive \nsovereign immunity and bestow authority to adminis-\ntratively entertain claims.\u201d Id.  \nIndeed, unlike Congress\u2019s early legislation decreeing \nthat the Treasury Department should settle \u201call \nclaims,\u201d Congress has in subsequent years dispersed \nsettlement authority across the federal government. In \nthe U.S. Code, there are \u201cmany authorities available \ntoday to administratively settle claims against the fed-\neral government,\u201d by numerous federal agencies. Id.; \nid. (offering \u201ca brief sampler\u201d of statutes authorizing \nvarious agencies to settle claims). \nAnd Congress is not alone: judicial interpretation \nand agency practice have similarly spread settlement \nauthority more widely. For example, this Court, in \nCorliss Steam-Engine, concluded that the Secretary of \nthe Navy\u2019s statutory authority to enter into contracts \nto acquire naval machinery necessarily encompassed \n\n25 \n \nthe power to settle claims for payment under such con-\ntracts\u2014including claims for partial performance. \u201cAs, \nin making the original contracts, he must agree upon \nthe compensation to be made for their entire perfor-\nmance, it would seem, that, when those contracts are \nsuspended by him, he must be equally authorized to \nagree upon the compensation for their partial perfor-\nmance.\u201d 91 U.S., at 322\u201323. The Court reasoned, \u201cit \nwould be of serious detriment to the public service if \nthe power of the head of the Navy Department did not \nextend to providing for all such possible contingencies \nby modification or suspension of the contracts, and set-\ntlement with the contractors.\u201d Id. at 323. \nAdditionally, after Congress created the General Ac-\ncounting Office and by statute transferred to that \nagency the authority to settle claims of the United \nStates, Budget and Accounting Act of 1921, Pub. L. No. \n67-13, \u00a7 305, 42 Stat. 20, 24 (1921), the GAO adopted \nthe practice of delegating the settlement function to \nother agencies. Rather than settle claims itself, \n\u201cGAO\u2019s policy was to leave initial settlement of a claim \nto the agency from whose activities the claims arose.\u201d \n42 Stat. at 14\u201324; see also 4 C.F.R. \u00a7 31.4 (1998) (\u201cA \nclaimant should file his or her claim with the adminis-\ntrative department or agency out of whose activities \nthe claim arose. The agency shall initially adjudicate \nthe claim.\u201d).  \n2. The Barring Act confers nonexclu-\nsive settlement authority and is dis-\nplaced by any \u201c[]other law\u201d authoriz-\ning claims settlement. \nGiven this history, it is unsurprising that the cur-\nrent Barring Act\u2014a much-amended statutory de-\nscendant of the 1817 law directing the Treasury to set-\ntle all claims, GAO Red Book at 14-5 n.28\u2014is explicit \nthat no agency has exclusive authority to settle claims \n\n26 \n \nagainst the United States. Instead, at this point in the \nnation\u2019s history, the Barring Act is no more than a \n\u201cgeneral background provision[]\u201d that is \u201cinapplicable\u201d \nwhere any other statute authorizes claims settlement. \nHernandez v. Dep\u2019t of Air Force, 498 F.3d 1328, 1332 \n(Fed. Cir. 2007). \nSpecifically, the Barring Act provides that, \u201c[e]xcept \nas provided in this chapter or another law, all claims \nof or against the United States Government shall be \nsettled as follows.\u201d 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3702(a) (emphasis \nadded). Subject to the \u201canother law\u201d carveout, the Bar-\nring Act then assigns settlement authority as to claims \ninvolving specified topics to the Secretary of Defense, \nthe Director of the Office of Personnel Management, \nand the Administrator of General Services, respec-\ntively, with the Director of the Office of Management \nand Budget assigned to \u201csettle claims not otherwise \nprovided for by this subsection or another provision of \nlaw.\u201d Id. \u00a7 3702(a)(1)\u2013(4).  \nCongress reiterated the nonexclusive nature of set-\ntlement authority in the legislation enacting the cur-\nrent version of the Barring Act. There, Congress ex-\nplained that the settlement function previously lodged \nwith the GAO would be transferred to the Director of \nOMB, but expressly provided that \u201c[t]he Director may \ndelegate any such function, in whole or in part, to any \nother agency or agencies if the Director determines \nthat such delegation would be cost-effective or other-\nwise in the public interest.\u201d Legislative Branch Appro-\npriations Act, Pub. L. No. 104-53, \u00a7 211, 109 Stat. 514, \n535 (1995). And, pursuant to this statutory authority,  \nOMB has delegated its residual settlement authority \nto various agencies, depending on the nature of the \nclaim. See Memorandum from Comptroller Gen., B-\n275605, Transfer of Claims Settlement and Related \n\n27 \n \nAdvance Decisions, Waivers, and Other Functions 1\u20132 \n(Mar. 17, 1997), https://perma.cc/89K2-DBKA. \nThe Barring Act also sets forth a time limit for \nclaims settled under that statute: \u201cA claim against the \nGovernment presented under this section . . .  must be \nreceived by the official responsible under subsection \n(a) for settling the claim or by the agency that conducts \nthe activity from which the claim arises within 6 years \nafter the claim accrues.\u201d 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3702(b)(1). As the \nprovision states expressly, this statute of limitations \napplies only to claims \u201cpresented under this section\u201d\u2014\ni.e., claims settled pursuant to the authority conferred \nin the Barring Act. Additionally, even for claims set-\ntled under the Barring Act, the six-year limit is dis-\nplaced if \u201canother law\u201d provides otherwise. Id. \n\u00a7 3702(b)(1)(A).  \nIn sum, under current law, any agency may settle a \nclaim against the United States if a statute authorizes \nthe agency to administratively determine the validity \nof the claim and the amount due on it. To the extent \nno other statute authorizes settlement of a particular \nclaim, the Barring Act acts as a gap-filler, supplying \ngeneral settlement authority to various agencies. \nWhen a claim is settled under the general authority \nconferred in the Barring Act, instead of under specific \nsettlement authority conferred in \u201canother law,\u201d the \nclaim is subject to the Barring Act\u2019s default six-year \nstatute of limitations. \nB. The CRSC statute confers authority to \nsettle and pay claims for CRSC. \nThe CRSC statute, on its face, grants authority to \nthe Secretaries of the military departments to settle \nclaims for CRSC. Because claims for CRSC are \nproperly settled under the specific settlement author-\nity granted in the CRSC statute, that statute \n\n28 \n \nconstitutes \u201canother law\u201d that displaces the Barring \nAct. Accordingly, the Barring Act\u2019s provisions\u2014includ-\ning the six-year statute of limitations in \u00a7 3702(b)\u2014do \nnot apply to CRSC claims. \n1. The CRSC statute authorizes the Sec-\nretary concerned to administratively \ndetermine the validity of a veteran\u2019s \nclaim for CRSC and the amount due. \nThe CSRC Statute begins as follows: \n(a) Authority.\u2014 \nThe Secretary concerned shall pay to each eligible \ncombat-related disabled uniformed services re-\ntiree who elects benefits under this section a \nmonthly amount for the combat-related disability \nof the retiree determined under subsection (b). \n10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1413a(a).  \nValidity. Subsection (a) grants the Secretary con-\ncerned \u201c[a]uthority\u201d to administratively determine the \nvalidity of a claim for CRSC, in that it directs the Sec-\nretary concerned to pay CSRC only to an \u201celigible com-\nbat-related disabled uniformed services retiree who \nelects benefits under this section.\u201d Id. (emphasis \nadded.) And the statute elsewhere confirms that it is \nthe Secretary concerned who is authorized to adminis-\ntratively determine the eligibility of an applicant elect-\ning CRSC benefits (and hence, a claim\u2019s validity). \nEligibility is defined in subsection (c). That section, \ntitled \u201cEligible retirees,\u201d provides that \u201c[f]or purposes \nof this section, an eligible combat-related disabled uni-\nformed services retiree referred to in subsection (a) is \na member of the uniformed services who\u2014(1) is enti-\ntled to retired pay . . .; and (2) has a combat-related \ndisability.\u201d Id. \u00a7 1413a(c) \u201cCombat-related disability\u201d \nis defined in subsection (e) to mean a disability \n\n29 \n \n\u201cattributable to an injury for which the member was \nawarded the Purple Heart\u201d or that was incurred \u201cas a \ndirect result of armed conflict,\u201d \u201cwhile engaged in haz-\nardous service,\u201d \u201cin the performance of duty under con-\nditions simulating war,\u201d or \u201cthrough an instrumental-\nity of war.\u201d  \nSubsection (d), in turn, provides that it is the Secre-\ntary concerned who must \u201cconsider[]\u201d whether an ap-\nplicant for CRSC is \u201can eligible combat-related disa-\nbled uniformed services retiree\u201d under these defini-\ntions and details how that consideration is to be con-\nducted. Id. \u00a7 1413a(d). In particular, subsection (d) \nstates that \u201c[t]he Secretary of Defense shall prescribe \nprocedures and criteria under which a disabled uni-\nformed services retiree may apply to the Secretary of \na military department[6] to be considered to be an eli-\ngible combat-related disabled uniformed services re-\ntiree.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Thus, Congress expressly di-\nrected that whether an applicant electing CRSC bene-\nfits is \u201can eligible combat-related disabled uniformed \nservices retiree\u201d\u2014i.e., whether an applicant has a \nvalid claim to CRSC benefits\u2014is a matter to be \u201ccon-\nsidered\u201d by the Secretary concerned, according to \nCRSC-specific procedures to be established by the De-\npartment of Defense. In short, by directing the Secre-\ntary concerned to \u201cconsider\u201d whether an applicant is \neligible for CRSC benefits\u2014and to pay CRSC only to \neligible applicants\u2014the statute\u2019s plain text authorizes \nthe Secretary concerned to administratively determine \n \n6 \u201cSecretary of a military department\u201d refers to the Secretary \nof the Army, Navy, or Air Force. See 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 101(a)(8) (defin-\ning \u201cmilitary departments\u201d). The Secretary of a military depart-\nment considering an individual applicant\u2019s eligibility will be the \nSecretary of the department from which the applicant retired. JA \n81, 92.  \n\n30 \n \nthe validity of each applicant\u2019s claim to CRSC pay-\nments. \nThis reading of the statutory text is echoed in the \nGuidance published by the Department of Defense un-\nder subsection (d). JA 77. That document makes clear \nthat\u2014as the statute provides\u2014\u201c[t]he Military Depart-\nments determine which applicants are entitled to \nCRSC.\u201d Id. At each step, the Guidance issued under \nthe statute reiterates that the administrative determi-\nnation of the validity of an applicant\u2019s claim is to be \nperformed by the relevant Military Department. Id. at \n80 (\u201cApplications for CRSC will be processed by the re-\nspective Military Department under these guide-\nlines.\u201d); id. at 87 (\u201c[T]he Military Departments will de-\ntermine whether the member\u2019s disabilities are qualify-\ning combat-related disabilities as prescribed below.\u201d); \nid. (\u201cA retiree is entitled to CRSC only if the Service \ndetermines that the member has Combat-Related Dis-\nabilities.\u201d); id. at 92 (\u201cEach Military Department will \nreceive and process CSRC applications submitted by \nmembers retired from that Military Department\u201d with \nan application to be approved \u201conly if the applicant \nsatisfies\u201d all CRSC eligibility criteria). \nThe Guidance accords with the statutory text: The \nSecretary concerned is authorized under the statute to \nadministratively determine whether an applicant is el-\nigible for CRSC, and thus has a valid claim for com-\npensation by the U.S. government.      \nAmount due. Subsection (a) also authorizes the Sec-\nretary concerned to administratively determine the \namount of CRSC owed on an eligible veteran\u2019s claim. \nSubsection (a) states that the Secretary concerned \nshall pay \u201ca monthly amount for the combat-related \ndisability of the retiree determined under subsection \n(b).\u201d 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1413a(a) (emphasis added). Under the \nplain text of subsection (a), therefore, \u201c[a]uthority\u201d is \n\n31 \n \nconferred on the Secretary concerned to \u201cdetermine[]\u201d \nthe monthly amount owed by applying subsection (b). \nSubsection (b) in turn \u201cprovides instructions on the \nadministrative calculation of the amount due to satisfy \nan eligible veteran\u2019s claim.\u201d Pet. App. 15a. Subsection \n(b)(1), titled \u201cDetermination of monthly amount,\u201d \nstates that \u201cthe monthly amount to be paid,\u201d subject to \nadditional conditions set forth in subsections (b)(2) and \n(b)(3), \u201cfor any month is the amount of compensation \nto which the retiree is entitled under title 38 for that \nmonth, determined without regard to the disability of \nthe retiree that is not a combat-related disability.\u201d \nSubsection (b)(2) puts a cap on the amount described \nin (b)(1), stating that the maximum amount of CRSC \nfor any month cannot exceed the amount of retired pay \nthat the veteran waived by electing to receive VA ben-\nefits. Id. \u00a7 1413a(b)(2) (citing 38 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5304, 5305). \nAnd subsection (b)(3) sets forth special rules for Chap-\nter 61 disability retirees,7 providing distinct, explicit \nformulae to follow when determining the amount due \ndepending on the veteran\u2019s situation. The effect of \nthese provisions is to \u201callow[] the veteran to maximize \nthe amount of compensation she would receive, includ-\ning as  a result of reductions in retired pay for a par-\nticular month.\u201d Pet. App. 15a (citing 10 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1413a(b)). In sum, the statute authorizes the Secre-\ntary to \u201cdetermine[]\u201d the amount due to an eligible vet-\neran\u2014and directs how to make that determination. \n \n7 10 U.S.C. ch. 61 governs retirement of service members who \nhave been determined to be unfit for duty due to disability. See \nDep\u2019t of Def., Military Compensation: Disability Retirement, \nhttps://tinyurl.com/ykyuek45 (last visited Feb. 28, 2025). \n\n32 \n \n2. The CRSC statute separately author-\nizes payment of CRSC. \nFinally, providing further confirmation that subsec-\ntion (a)\u2019s grant of \u201cauthority\u201d to the Secretary con-\ncerned confers settlement authority is that the statute \nseparately authorizes the payment of CRSC claims \nfrom specific appropriated funds. As noted above, set-\ntlement of claims and payment of claims are separate \nfunctions that must be separately authorized. See Ill. \nSur., 240 U.S. at 218\u201319 (statutory term \u201csettlement\u201d \nof claims could not be interpreted to \u201cdenote payment\u201d \nof claims); see also GAO Red Book at 14\u201329 (\u201cJust be-\ncause a claim is approved through the claims settle-\nment process does not necessarily mean that it can or \nwill be paid. For the claim to be paid, appropriated \nfunds must be available for that purpose.\u201d).  \nConsistent with this longstanding understanding, \nthe CRSC statute confers authority not only to settle \nclaims, as described above, but also to make payment \non settled claims using particular appropriated funds. \nSubsection (h) sets forth the \u201cSource of payments\u201d of \nCRSC: Payments to veterans of the Army, Navy, Air \nForce, Marine Corps, or Space Force \u201cshall be paid \nfrom the Department of Defense Military Retirement \nFund,\u201d while payments for any other member \u201cshall be \npaid out of funds appropriated for pay and allowances \npayable by the Secretary concerned for that fiscal \nyear.\u201d 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1413a(h). \nThis separate provision for payment of CRSC is tell-\ning. It is consistent with typical legislative practice to \nprovide for both settlement of claims and payment of \nclaims using appropriated funds in the same statute. \nIn the words of the GAO Red Book, \u201cWhen considering \nwhat appropriation to use to pay an administratively \nsettled claim, the first place to look is the statute au-\nthorizing the settlement.\u201d GAO Red Book at 14\u201345. \n\n33 \n \nWhere, as with the CRSC statute, a statute \u201cgoverning \nspecific types of claims contain[s] detailed provisions \ngoverning the payment of those claims,\u201d id. at 14\u201344, \nthen the statute establishes a self-contained compen-\nsation scheme\u2014here, providing for both administra-\ntive determination of the validity of CRSC claims and \namount due thereon, as well as the ultimate payment \nof settled claims. \n* * * * * \nBecause the CRSC statute authorizes the Secretary \nconcerned to administratively determine (a) whether \nan applicant is eligible for CRSC, and (b) how much \nCRSC the applicant is owed, the CRSC statute author-\nizes the Secretary concerned to settle claims for CRSC. \nThe CRSC statute is thus \u201canother law\u201d that displaces \nthe Barring Act. The Federal Circuit\u2019s contrary deci-\nsion was erroneous.  \nII. \nTHE TEST CREATED BY THE FEDERAL \nCIRCUIT IS INCORRECT AND SHOULD \nBE REJECTED.  \nThe Federal Circuit majority held that the Barring \nAct was not displaced\u2014and that its statute of limita-\ntions applied to limit the CRSC available to Corporal \nSoto and the class\u2014based on its conclusion that the \nCRSC statute \u201cconveys no\u201d settlement authority. Pet. \nApp. 7a. According to the Federal Circuit, in order to \ndisplace the Barring Act a statute \u201cmust explicitly \ngrant an agency or entity the authority to settle \nclaims\u201d using \u201cspecific language,\u201d which the majority \nstated \u201cwill typically be done by the use of the term \n\u2018settle.\u2019\u201d Id. at 6a\u20137a. Thus, rather than review the \nCRSC statute\u2019s provisions to determine whether it au-\nthorized claims settlement, the majority simply evalu-\nated whether the statute \u201cmention[s] settlement.\u201d Id. \nNot finding the word \u201csettle,\u201d the Federal Circuit \n\n34 \n \nconcluded that the CRSC statute \u201conly establishes who \nmay be eligible for CRSC payments, not how claimants \ncan have those claims settled.\u201d Id. The majority fur-\nther held that \u201c[w]ithout specific language,\u201d the CRSC \nstatute would need to \u201cprovide[] a \u2018specific\u2019 provision \nsetting out the period of recovery,\u201d a requirement the \nmajority said also was not satisfied. Id. \nThis two-part test disregards this Court\u2019s definition \nof \u201csettlement,\u201d imposes unjustified requirements on \nCongress, and otherwise lacks a basis in the law of \nstatutory interpretation. The Court should reject it. \nA. \nThere is no requirement that a statute use \nthe word \u201csettle\u201d to displace the Barring \nAct.  \n1. The Federal Circuit\u2019s \u201cspecific lan-\nguage\u201d requirement is inconsistent \nwith precedent. \nThe Federal Circuit\u2019s demand for \u201cspecial lan-\nguage\u201d addressing settlement finds no support in stat-\nutory history or case law. \nFirst, no authority supports the notion that the \nword \u201csettle\u201d must appear for a statute to confer set-\ntlement authority. While some statutes addressing \nclaims settlement use the term \u201csettle,\u201d others use dif-\nferent terms (such as \u201cadjust,\u201d \u201caudit,\u201d \u201cadjudicate,\u201d or \n\u201cdetermine\u201d) or confer authority to settle claims by au-\nthorizing conduct that encompasses claims settlement. \nThat is the upshot of this Court\u2019s decision in Corliss \nSteam-Engine. There, the Court acknowledged that \nthe power to settle claims \u201cis, of course, limited by the \nlegislation of Congress,\u201d but concluded that the Secre-\ntary of the Navy had legislative authority to settle a \nclaim for payment for partial performance on a manu-\nfacturing contract without regard to the presence or \n\n35 \n \nabsence of \u201cspecial language\u201d in the statute. 91 U.S. at \n322\u201323. Instead, the Court concluded that the requi-\nsite settlement authority existed because \u201cdischarge of \nthe duty devolving upon the secretary necessarily re-\nquires him to enter into numerous contracts,\u201d some of \nwhich would inevitably have to be suspended, and he \naccordingly was necessarily \u201cauthorized to agree upon \nthe compensation for their partial performance.\u201d Id. In \nshort, the Secretary\u2019s authority to settle claims was \nfound through a functional analysis of the authorities \ngranted to him in the statute\u2014not simply by asking \nwhether the statute \u201cmention[ed] settlement\u201d as the \nFederal Circuit majority did here. Pet. App. 7a.  \nSimilarly, in Hernandez, the Federal Circuit ad-\ndressed whether the Barring Act applied to settlement \nof claims brought under the Uniformed Services Em-\nployment and Reemployment Rights Act (\u201cUSERRA\u201d), \n38 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 4301\u20134333. 498 F.3d at 1330\u201331. The \nFederal Circuit concluded that settlement of claims \nunder USERRA is governed exclusively by 38 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 4324(c), which provides that \u201c[t]he Merit Systems \nProtection Board shall adjudicate any complaint.\u201d Ac-\ncording to the Federal Circuit, this language\u2014which \nrefers neither to \u201csettlement\u201d nor \u201cclaims\u201d\u2014was suffi-\ncient to displace the Barring Act. 480 F.3d at 1331.  \nAnd in McNeil v. United States, 78 Fed. Cl. 211 \n(2007), the Court of Federal Claims held that a series \nof statutes each could serve as \u201canother law\u201d providing \nthe Secretary of the Treasury with authority to settle \nclaims of or against the United States, displacing the \nBarring Act. Id. at 221. Among other things, the \nMcNeil court pointed to 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6402(a), which pro-\nvides that \u201c[i]n the case of any overpayment [of taxes], \nthe Secretary, within the applicable period of limita-\ntions, may credit the amount of such overpayment . . .  \nagainst any liability in respect of an internal revenue \n\n36 \n \ntax on the part of the person who made the overpay-\nment and shall . . .  refund any balance to such person.\u201d \nJust like the CRSC statute, \u00a7 6402(a) authorizes the \nSecretary to determine (a) whether a tax refund is \nowed (i.e., whether there is a valid claim) and (b) the \namount of such refund\u2014and then authorizes the Sec-\nretary to pay it. Thus, just like the CRSC statute, 26 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 6402(a) authorizes settlement of claims and \ndisplaces the Barring Act. McNeil, 78 Fed. Cl. at 221.  \nThe OMB has recognized yet more statutes that \nconfer settlement authority without using the term. \nFor example, OMB delegated to the Department of De-\nfense its authority to settle claims under 10 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 2575, a statute that does not mention settlement, but \ninstead authorizes the Secretary of any military de-\npartment to dispose of unclaimed personal property \n\u201cunder such regulations as they may \u2026 prescribe.\u201d See \nTransfer of Claims Settlement and Related Advance \nDecisions, Waivers, and Other Functions, 97-1 Comp. \nGen. Proc. Dec. P123 (Comp. Gen. Mar. 17, 1997), At-\ntachment A. Likewise, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 7712, formerly cod-\nified at 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 4712, relates to claims for the pro-\nceeds of effects of persons who pass away in locations \nunder Army jurisdiction. When Congress initially \ndrafted the statute, it included a subsection (g), which \nused the word \u201csettlement\u201d to vest authority in the \nGAO to address claims. See 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 4712 amended \nby Gen. Acct. Off. Act of 1996, Pub. L. No. 104-316, 110 \nStat. 3826 (1996) (current version at 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 7712). \nUltimately, Congress decided to remove that subsec-\ntion, intending to transfer the authority from GAO to \nthe Department of Defense. See \u00a7\u00a7 201, 202(g), 110 \nStat. at 3842 (noting that \u201c[t]he purpose of this title is \nto amend provisions of law to reflect, update, and enact \ntransfers and subsequent delegations of functions . . .  \nas in effect immediately before this title takes effect); \n\n37 \n \nIn re Transfer Claim Settlement and Related Advance \nDecisions, 97-1 Comp. Gen. Proc. Dec. P123, at *9 \n(Mar. 17, 1997) (acknowledging that 110 Stat. 3826 \ntransferred settlement authority for claims under 10 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 4712 to DoD). Thus, as it stands, 10 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 7712 does not contain the word \u201csettle\u201d\u2014yet Con-\ngress plainly intended to provide settlement authority.  \nMore broadly, this Court has rejected an approach to \nstatutory interpretation that requires \u201cmagic words\u201d \nin a statute, as the Federal Circuit\u2019s test does. In the \ncontext of the Government\u2019s waiver of sovereign im-\nmunity\u2014like settlement authority, a legislative pre-\nrequisite to payment of claims out of government \nfunds\u2014this Court has said that \u201cCongress need not \nstate its intent [to waive sovereign immunity] in any \nparticular way. We have never required that Congress \nuse magic words.\u201d FAA v. Cooper, 566 U.S. 284, 291 \n(2012). Instead, the Court requires only \u201cthat the scope \nof Congress\u2019 waiver be clearly discernable from the \nstatutory text in light of traditional interpretive tools.\u201d \nId; See also Dep\u2019t of Agric. Rural Dev. Rural Hous. \nServ. v. Kirtz, 601 U.S. 42, 48\u201349 (2024) (although \nCongress\u2019s intent to waive sovereign immunity must \nbe \u201cunmistakably clear,\u201d \u201cCongress need not state its \nintent in any particular way,\u201d \u201cneed not use magic \nwords,\u201d and need not \u201cmake its clear statement in a \nsingle section or in statutory provisions enacted at the \nsame time\u201d) (citations and internal quotation marks \nomitted); Lac du Flambeau Band of Lake Superior \nChippewa Indians v. Coughlin, 599 U.S. 382, 394 \n(2023) (\u201c[T]he clear-statement rule is not a magic-\nwords requirement.\u201d).  \nHere, Congress squarely authorized the Secretaries \nof the military departments to administratively deter-\nmine both whether an applicant has a valid CRSC \nclaim and the amount due. Had the Federal Circuit \n\n38 \n \nused \u201ctraditional tools of statutory interpretation\u201d ra-\nther than presuming a statute does not grant settle-\nment authority in the absence of \u201cspecific language,\u201d \nsee Cooper, 566 U.S. at 291, it would have held that \nthe CRSC confers settlement authority and therefore \ndisplaces the Barring Act.  \nIndeed, the Federal Circuit\u2019s \u201cspecific language\u201d test \namounts to a novel substantive canon of construction: \nit presumes that statutes do not grant settlement au-\nthority in the absence of \u201cspecific language.\u201d See \nRudisill v. McDonough, 601 U.S. 294, 315 (2024) (Ka-\nvanaugh, J., concurring) (\u201cA substantive canon is a ju-\ndicial presumption in favor of or against a particular \nsubstantive outcome.\u201d); see also Pet. App. 16a n.4 \n(Reyna, J., dissenting) (noting that the majority\u2019s \n\u201csearch for \u2018clear language\u2019\u201d indicates \u201cdoubt\u201d as to the \nstatutory meaning). But applying this unprecedented \npresumption in interpreting a statute drafted two dec-\nades earlier\u2014when no court or other authority had \nidentified a \u201cspecific language\u201d requirement for settle-\nment authority\u2014was inappropriate. Although Con-\ngress is presumed to legislate with knowledge of this \nCourt\u2019s canons and interpretive principles, see Bond v. \nUnited States, 572 U.S. 844, 857 (2014); King v. St. \nVincent\u2019s Hosp., 502 U.S. 215, 220 n. 9 (1991), it can \nhardly be presumed to have drafted the CRSC statute \nwith foreknowledge that the Federal Circuit would two \ndecades later interpret any statute without \u201cspecific \nlanguage\u201d not to afford settlement authority.  \nTo the extent the Federal Circuit saw fit to resort to \na substantive canon of construction, it should have \nconsidered the veterans canon long recognized by this \nCourt. See Rudisill, 601 U.S. at 314 (Kavanaugh, J., \nconcurring) (\u201cUnder the veterans canon, statutes that \nprovide benefits to veterans are to be construed \u2018in the \nveteran\u2019s favor.\u2019\u201d) (quoting Brown v. Gardner, 513 U.S. \n\n39 \n \n115, 118 (1994)); King, 502 U.S. at 221 (same); Fish-\ngold v. Sullivan Drydock & Repair Corp., 328 U.S. 275, \n285 (1946) (\u201c[L]egislation is to be liberally construed \nfor the benefit of those who left private life to serve \ntheir country in its hour of great need.\u201d). To be sure, \nsome members of this Court have lately called the vet-\nerans canon into question. Rudisill, 601 U.S. at 314\u2013\n15 (Kavanaugh, J., concurring); id. at 329 (Thomas, J., \ndissenting). Whatever the ongoing viability of the vet-\nerans canon may be, as of 2003, \u201c[i]t is presumable that \nCongress legislate[d] with knowledge\u201d of the at-that-\ntime widely accepted veterans canon. King, 502 U.S. \nat 220 n.9 (internal quotation marks and citation omit-\nted). To the extent the Federal Circuit concluded that \nsettlement authority could not be unambiguously dis-\ncerned from the plain text of the CRSC statute, it \nshould have interpreted perceived Congressional si-\nlence to favor veterans entitled to CRSC benefits\u2014and \nnot, as it did, to preclude settlement authority.   \n2. The CRSC statute does not merely es-\ntablish \u201celigibility\u201d for CRSC. \nWith its myopic search for \u201cspecific language\u201d re-\nlated to settlement, the Federal Circuit misread what \nthe CRSC statute actually says. In the majority\u2019s read-\ning, the statute \u201conly establishes who may be eligible \nfor CRSC payments, not how claimants can have those \nclaims settled.\u201d Pet. App. 7a; see also id. at 8a (the \nCRSC statute \u201cestablish[es] a veteran\u2019s substantive \nright to CRSC,\u201d but \u201cdo[es] not authorize the Secretary \nto administratively determine the validity of a claim\u201d) \n(citation and internal quotation marks omitted). As \nJudge Reyna wrote in dissent, \u201c[t]his is belied by the \nprovisions of the CRSC statute itself.\u201d Id. at 18a. \nAs discussed above, the CRSC statute describes ex-\nactly \u201chow claimants can have [their] claims settled.\u201d \nTo determine the validity of a CRSC claim, \u201ca disabled \n\n40 \n \nuniformed services retiree may apply to the Secretary \nof a military department to be considered to be an eli-\ngible combat-related disabled uniformed services re-\ntiree\u201d under \u201cprocedures and criteria\u201d prescribed by \nthe Department of Defense. 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1413a(d). \nLooking for the word \u201csettle,\u201d the majority ignored this \nprovision. To determine the amount of CRSC due to an \napplicant, the CRSC statute provides that the Secre-\ntary shall pay \u201ca monthly amount \u2026 determined under \nsubsection (b).\u201d Id. \u00a7 1413a(a). The majority ignored \nthis provision as well.  \nAs is clear from the face of the statute, the majority \nwas wrong to conclude that the CRSC statute solely \naddresses the right of eligible veterans to obtain \nCRSC. Instead, starting from its very first word, the \nCRSC statute confers \u201c[a]uthority\u201d on the Secretary \nconcerned to \u201cdetermine[]\u201d and \u201cconsider[]\u201d both the \nvalidity of claims to CRSC and the amount due. Id. \n\u00a7 1413a(a), (d).  \nIn this way, the CRSC statute is flatly different from \nother statutes addressing the entitlement of active and \nretired service members to compensation. See Br. of \nthe United States in Opposition (\u201cBIO\u201d) 11 (listing \nsuch statutes). Each of the statutes identified by the \ngovernment provides for an individual\u2019s entitlement to \ncompensation\u2014not the Secretary\u2019s authority to admin-\nistratively determine what compensation is due. See, \ne.g., 37 U.S.C. \u00a7 204(a) (\u201cThe following persons are en-\ntitled to . . .  basic pay\u201d); id. \u00a7 302(a) (\u201cAn officer who is \nan officer of the Medical Corps . . .  is entitled to special \npay . . . .\u201d); 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1401(a) (\u201cThe monthly retired \npay of a person entitled thereto . . .  is computed ac-\ncording to the following table.\u201d); id. \u00a7 12731(a) (\u201cEx-\ncept as provided in subsection (c), a person is entitled, \nupon application, to retired pay . . .\u201d); id. \u00a7 12739(a) \n(\u201cThe monthly retired pay of a person entitled to that \n\n41 \n \npay under this chapter is the product of [two compo-\nnents].\u201d); id. \u00a7 1448(a)(1) (\u201cThe following persons are \neligible to participate in the [Survivor Benefit Plan].\u201d); \nid. \u00a7 1451(a) (discussing what \u201cstandard annuity\u201d is \n\u201cpayable to the beneficiary\u201d). None of these statutes \nstates, as the CRSC statute does expressly, that the \nSecretary or any particular person is granted \n\u201c[a]uthority\u201d encompassing the determination of the \nvalidity of and amount due on claims. \nB. \nThere is no requirement that a statute pro-\nvide an independent statute of limitations \nto displace the Barring Act.  \nThe Federal Circuit\u2019s majority opinion suggests, as \nan apparent alternative requirement to the word \u201cset-\ntle,\u201d that a statute must include  \u201ca \u2018specific\u2019 provision \nsetting out the period of recovery\u201d to provide the au-\nthority to settle a claim and thus displace the Barring \nAct. Pet. App. 7a.8 To the extent the majority believed \nthat another statute displaces the Barring Act only if \nthe other statute has an express statute of limitations, \nthis conclusion, too, finds no support in either the text \nof the Barring Act or precedent. \nThe preamble of the Barring Act states, \u201c[e]xcept as \nprovided in this chapter or another law, all claims \n \n8 The Federal Circuit cited its own Hernandez opinion in connec-\ntion with this requirement, as the statutory provision cited in \nHernandez indicates that a complaint for certain employment \nrights should be considered by the MSPB regardless of when the \ncomplaint accrued. See 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 4324(c). However, the entire \nUniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act \n(\u201cUSERRA\u201d), 38 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 4301\u20134333 includes a series of specific \n\u201cprocedures for assistance, enforcement, and investigation\u201d of em-\nployment rights claims, id. \u00a7\u00a7 4321\u20134327. USERRA displaces the \nBarring Act because it provides these procedures for settling such \nclaims\u2014not because it includes a subsection addressing when \ncomplaints may be filed. \n\n42 \n \nagainst the United States Government shall be settled \nas follows . . .\u201d 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3702. If another statue pro-\nvides for the settlement (i.e., the administrative deter-\nmination) of claims against the United States, none of \nthe Barring Act\u2019s provisions apply. The Barring Act\u2019s \nlimitations provision, subsection (b), applies only to \nclaims \u201cpresented under this section\u201d\u2014i.e., the Bar-\nring Act. Id. \u00a7 3702(b)(1). Thus, if another statute pro-\nvides for the settlement of claims, then the Barring Act \ndoes not apply\u2014and, because the claim is not \u201cpre-\nsented under this section,\u201d the Barring Act\u2019s statute of \nlimitations does not apply either.  \nWhether another statute that authorizes claims set-\ntlement also provides for a separate statute of limita-\ntions is thus of no moment under the Barring Act. The \nFederal Circuit should not have read into the text a \nlimitations requirement that it does not contain. See \nBostock v. Clayton Cnty., 590 U.S. 644, 654 (2020) (\u201cAf-\nter all, only the words on the page constitute the law \nadopted by Congress and approved by the President.\u201d); \nMobil Oil Corp. v. Higginbotham, 436 U.S. 618, 625 \n(1978) (\u201cThere is a basic difference between filling a \ngap left by Congress\u2019 silence and rewriting rules that \nCongress has affirmatively and specifically enacted.\u201d); \nUnited States v. Locke, 471 U.S. 84, 95 (1985) (finding \nthat it is not the judiciary\u2019s role to redraft statutes). \nThis Court\u2019s inquiry can and should stop there. See \nRobinson v. Shell Oil Co., 519 U.S. 337, 340 (1997) \n(\u201cOur first step in interpreting a statute is to deter-\nmine whether the language at issue has a plain and \nunambiguous meaning with regard to the particular \ndispute in the case. Our inquiry must cease if the stat-\nutory language is unambiguous and \u2018the statutory \nscheme is coherent and consistent.\u2019\u201d) (quoting United \nStates v. Ron Pair Enter., Inc., 489 U.S. 235, 340 \n(1989)).  \n\n43 \n \nIn any event, the absence of a limitations period in \nthe CRSC statute does not call into question whether \nthat statute confers settlement authority. As the stat-\nute makes clear, CRSC is to be paid \u201cfor any month\u201d in \nwhich the claimant is eligible. 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1413a(b)(1); \nsee also JA 98 (\u201cMembers may submit an application \nfor CRSC at any time and, if otherwise qualified for \nCRSC, compensation will be paid retroactively, to the \nextent otherwise allowed by law, for any month after \nMay 2003, for which all conditions of eligibility were \nmet, determined according to the requirements and \nentitlements as they applied each month for which \nbenefits are considered.\u201d). Indeed, the absence of an \nexplicit statute of limitations makes sense given how \nthe statute operates.  \nFirst, CRSC benefits are necessarily time-limited, \nbecause they are available only from the time a service \nmember retires through the end of his or her lifetime; \nCRSC does not extend to a retiree\u2019s heirs. See 10 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 1413a(a), (c). There is thus no risk that claim-\nants will pursue \u201cstale claims . . .  50 to 100 years after \nthey first accrued\u201d under the CRSC statute. See BIO \n11. Second, no interest is paid on retroactive CRSC \npayments. See 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1413a(b); Smith v. Gober, \n14 Vet. App. 227, 231 (2000), aff'd sub nom. Smith v. \nPrincipi, 281 F.3d 1384 (Fed. Cir. 2002) (\u201cCongress has \nenacted a comprehensive statutory scheme for the pay-\nment of veterans benefits. In this case, there is no stat-\nute or regulation that authorizes the Secretary to pay \ninterest on past due benefits under any circumstances, \nto include the exercise of his equitable powers.\u201d); \nSandstrom v. Principi, 358 F.3d 1376, 1379 (Fed. Cir. \n2004) (\u201cUnder the longstanding \u2018no-interest rule,\u2019 sov-\nereign immunity shields the U.S. government from in-\nterest charges for which it would otherwise be liable, \nunless it explicitly waives that immunity . . .\u201d). CRSC \n\n44 \n \nbeneficiaries thus have every financial incentive to \npursue CRSC claims promptly. Any veteran who chose \nto \u201cwait indefinitely,\u201d BIO 11\u201312, rather than claim all \nthe CRSC benefits available at the earliest oppor-\ntunity, would accordingly be financially penalized.  \nAdditionally, to the extent the passage of time \nmakes records less accessible, see BIO 11, that too \nworks to the detriment of veterans seeking CRSC. The \nburden is on applicants to collect and submit documen-\ntation demonstrating that the applicant\u2019s disability re-\nsults from a combat-related injury. Supra at 6 & n.3. \nIf necessary documents are lost or unavailable, CRSC \nbenefits will be denied under the CRSC Guidance. See \nJA 98\u201399. Again, given the operation of the CRSC stat-\nute, all incentives favor submitting a claim promptly \nupon eligibility, regardless of the absence of a statute \nof limitations. \nEven so, veterans confronting significant disabilities \nmay face emotional and physical obstacles that make \nit difficult for them to apply for benefits as soon as they \nare eligible. See Cert-stage NLSVCC Amicus Br. 12\u2013\n17 (\u201cMedical and social challenges commonly faced by \ncombat-wounded retirees are likely to have direct and \nsignificant negative impact on their ability to apply for \nCRSC within six years of eligibility.\u201d). In enacting the \nCRSC statute, Congress resolved that such veterans \nwarrant special treatment in the form of compensation \nthat is unavailable to other veterans\u2014compensation \ndesigned to make veterans with combat-related inju-\nries, to the extent possible, as whole as the government \ncan to compensate for the enormous sacrifice they have \nmade. Congress\u2019s election not to limit the time in \nwhich this especially deserving group may pursue ben-\nefits granted to them by statute is fully consistent with \nthe statute\u2019s broader purpose. \n\n45 \n \nAny suggestion that a ruling for Corporal Soto will \nresult in an onslaught of ancient and stale claims is an \nunsupported \u201cparade of horribles\u201d argument of the sort \nthis Court has repeatedly rejected. See Truck Ins. \nExch. v. Kaiser Gypsum Co., 602 U.S. 268, 284 (2009) \n(\u201cThis \u2018parade of horribles\u2019 arguments cannot override \nthe statute\u2019s text . . .\u201d); CFTC v.

          "task_beliefs": "My initial belief state was a tabula rasa regarding the specifics of *Soto v. United States*. I knew only the basic facts provided: a dispute between the CRSC statute and the Barring Act's six-year limit for a veteran's retroactive pay, and the lower court history where the District Court found for Soto but the Federal Circuit reversed.\n\nThis observation, while internal reasoning, has refined my understanding of the task by structuring the problem. I now have a clear set of specific, unanswered questions that define the core of the legal dispute. My knowledge has evolved from a general awareness of the conflict to a targeted set of inquiries:\n-   **Central Legal Tension:** The conflict is not just between two statutes, but between two competing principles of statutory interpretation: the canon that a specific statute (CRSC) governs over a general one (the Barring Act), versus the Federal Circuit's reasoning for applying the general statute. Understanding the Federal Circuit's rationale is now a primary goal.\n-   **Key Arguments to Uncover:** I must investigate the specific textual and structural arguments that support each side. This moves beyond the case facts and into the legal mechanics of the arguments that will be presented to the Court.\n-   **Pro-Veteran Canon:** The District Court's use of the pro-veteran canon is a key feature of the case. Its relevance and persuasive power before the Supreme Court is a critical variable.\n\nMy confidence in any prediction remains zero, but my uncertainty is now structured. I know precisely what information I need to gather to begin forming a probabilistic forecast.",
          "design_beliefs": "My initial belief state was that I had no knowledge of effective strategies for predicting Supreme Court outcomes. This observation provides the first, foundational principles for my design methodology. By analyzing my own reasoning process, I have learned:\n-   **Decomposition Heuristic:** A crucial first step in tackling a complex prediction task is to decompose it into two distinct sets of questions:\n    1.  Case-specific legal questions (\u03b8-level).\n    2.  General strategic or jurisprudential questions about the Court's behavior (D-level).\n-   **Strategic Sequencing:** It is more effective to prioritize building a foundational understanding of the case-specific arguments (\u03b8) before deeply investigating the meta-level patterns (D). Understanding *what* the parties are arguing provides the necessary context to evaluate *how* the Court might react based on its general principles. Attempting to analyze D without a solid \u03b8 foundation would be abstract and likely inaccurate.\n-   **Source Prioritization:** For acquiring foundational case-specific knowledge (\u03b8), primary source documents like the petitioner's and respondent's briefs are the highest-value information sources. They contain the direct arguments the Court will consider, making them more valuable for initial analysis than secondary sources or news articles.\n-   **Formulating a Research Agenda:** A good strategy involves not only answering immediate questions but also explicitly listing the next set of inquiries. For this task, my D-level research agenda now includes investigating:\n    -   The current Supreme Court's application of the pro-veteran canon.\n    -   The Court's precedents on conflicts between specific benefit statutes and general statutes of limitations.\n    -   Potential splits along methodological lines (e.g., textualism vs. purposivism) on this type of issue.\n\nThis establishes a core methodology: Decompose, Prioritize \u03b8, Target Primary Sources, and Build a Research Agenda."

The Task EIG is 1.0 because this is the single most valuable piece of information I can acquire at this stage. The Design EIG is also very high (0.8). Observing the U.S. government's response will provide crucial data to test and refine my newly formed 'Argument Prioritization' heuristic. It will reveal whether elite advocates for the government also prioritize textualism, and it will provide a template for how to construct a defense of a lower court ruling against a textualist challenge. This provides a critical insight into the dialogic nature of SCOTUS advocacy, moving beyond initial arguments to counter-arguments, which is a key generalizable strategy.

In this context, the term \u201csettle\u201d means to make \na final administrative determination regarding the gov-\nernment\u2019s total liability on a claim.  See Illinois Sur. Co. \nv. United States, 240 U.S. 214, 219 (1916).  The Barring \nAct specifies which officials are authorized to settle the \naccounts of federal employees and when such claims \nmust be presented.  As relevant here, the Act authorizes \nthe Secretary of Defense to settle all claims \u201cinvolving \nuniformed service members\u2019 pay, allowances, travel, \ntransportation, payments for unused accrued leave, re-\ntired pay, and survivor benefits.\u201d  31 U.S.C. 3702(a)(1)(A).  \nThat authority is subject to a six-year time limit for sub-\nmitting claims, 31 U.S.C. 3702(b)(1), which the Secre-\ntary may waive for claims that do not exceed $25,000,  \n31 U.S.C. 3702(e)(1) and (3). \nAt issue in this case are claims for allegedly unpaid \ncombat-related special compensation (CRSC), which is \na compensation available only to retired uniformed ser-\nvice members with combat-related disabilities who elect \nbenefits under 10 U.S.C. 1413a (2018 & Supp. IV 2022).  \nThe Department of Defense has exercised its authority \nunder the Barring Act to settle petitioner\u2019s claims for \nretroactive payment of CRSC, subject to a six-year pay-\nment cap in light of the Barring Act\u2019s claim-submission \ndeadline.  The question presented is as follows: \nWhether 10 U.S.C. 1413a displaces the settlement \nprocedures and limitations set forth in the Barring Act.   \n \n\n(III) \nTABLE OF CONTENTS \nPage\nOpinions below .............................................................................. 1 \nJurisdiction .................................................................................... 1 \nStatement ...................................................................................... 1 \nArgument ....................................................................................... 8 \nConclusion ................................................................................... 17 \nTABLE OF AUTHORITIES \nCases: \nJoseph M.

App. 1a-19a) \nis reported at 92 F.4th 1094.  The order of the district \ncourt (Pet. App. 32a-37a) is available at 2021 WL \n7286022.  A prior order of the district court (Pet. App. \n21a-31a) is unreported. \nJURISDICTION \nThe judgment of the court of appeals (Pet. App. 20a) \nwas entered on February 12, 2024.  A petition for re-\nhearing was denied on June 20, 2024 (Pet. App. 40a-\n41a).  The petition for a writ of certiorari was filed on \nSeptember 18, 2024.  The jurisdiction of this Court is \ninvoked under 28 U.S.C. 1254(1).  \nSTATEMENT \n1. The Barring Act, 31 U.S.C. 3702, provides a com-\nprehensive remedy for the settlement of claims \u201cof or \n\n2 \n \nagainst the United States\u201d except where that law is su-\nperseded by another, more specific claims-settlement \nstatute.  31 U.S.C. 3702(a); see 3 Office of the Gen. \nCounsel, U.S. Gen. Accounting Office (GAO), GAO-08-\n978SP, Principles of Federal Appropriations Law 14-\n23 to 14-28 (3d ed., rev. vol. 2016) (GAO Red Book).  The \nterm \u201csettle\u201d in this context means to make a final ad-\nministrative determination regarding the government\u2019s \ntotal liability on a claim\u2014that is, to determine the spe-\ncific amount owed to an individual under the terms of \nfederal contracts or statutory provisions, including any \napplicable adjustments and offsets.  See Illinois Sur. \nCo. v. United States, 240 U.S. 214, 219 (1916).  As origi-\nnally enacted, the settlement authority conferred by the \nBarring Act \u201cwas not only comprehensive but exclu-\nsive,\u201d so that all claims and accounts concerning the \nUnited States would be \u201csettled and adjusted in the \nTreasury Department.\u201d  GAO Red Book 14-23 (quoting \nAct of Mar. 3, 1817, ch. 45, \u00a7 2, 3 Stat. 366).  Since then, \nCongress has enacted several amendments to this broad \ngrant of settlement authority.  Three of those amend-\nments are relevant here. \nFirst, Congress has amended the Barring Act to \ntransfer claims-settlement responsibility from the Treas-\nury Department to various other agencies, depending \non the nature of the claim involved.  See 31 U.S.C. \n3702(a)(1)-(4); see generally GAO Red Book 14-23 to 14-\n24 (detailing the history of such transfers).   \nSecond, Congress established a six-year deadline for \nthe submission of claims falling within the Barring Act\u2019s \nscope.  See GAO Act of 1974, Pub. L. No. 93-604, \u00a7 801, \n88 Stat. 1965.  That amendment conformed the Barring \nAct \u201cto the 6-year limitation period applicable to judicial \nactions on claims against the United States under 28 \n\n3 \n \nU.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2401 and 2501,\u201d and the amendment\u2019s legisla-\ntive history \u201cnoted that \u2018[t]his will make the time limi-\ntation consistent with the Statute of Limitations now \napplicable to claims filed in administrative agencies and \nthe courts.\u2019\u200a\u201d  In re Joseph M. Ford, 73 Comp. Gen. 157, \n161 (1994) (quoting S. Rep. No. 1314, 93d Cong., 2d \nSess. 5-6 (1974)) (brackets in original).1  Agencies are \nnot permitted to waive or extend this six-year statute of \nlimitations except where a statute expressly authorizes \nthat step.  See GAO Red Book 14-28 to 14-29. \nThird, the Barring Act\u2019s administrative claims- \nsettlement authority is no longer exclusive.  Over the \nyears, Congress has enacted various laws that ex-\npressly authorize specific agencies to settle certain \nclaims that arise out of the agency\u2019s operations, and \nthose specific claims-settlement procedures supersede \nthe Barring Act\u2019s generally applicable provisions.  See \nGAO Red Book 14-21 to 14-23 (listing statutes that per-\nmit agencies to settle claims administratively).  The \nBarring Act\u2019s directive regarding who has final author-\nity to settle claims of or against the United States, and \nwhen those claims must be presented, are thus provi-\nsions of general applicability that govern \u201c[e]xcept as \nprovided in this chapter or another law.\u201d  31 U.S.C. \n3702(a). \nAs relevant here, the Barring Act vests in the Secre-\ntary of Defense the authority to settle all claims \u201cinvolv-\ning uniformed service members\u2019 pay, allowances, travel, \ntransportation, payments for unused accrued leave, retired \npay, and survivor benefits.\u201d  31 U.S.C. 3702(a)(1)(A).2  \n \n1  Before the 1974 amendment, the Barring Act\u2019s statute of limita-\ntions was ten years.  See Ford, 73 Comp. Gen. at 161. \n2  See 31 U.S.C. 3702(a)(2) (similarly delegating to the Office of \nPersonnel Management the authority to settle claims involving  \n\n4 \n \nSuch claims must be presented \u201cwithin 6 years after the \nclaim accrues,\u201d however, subject to enumerated excep-\ntions.  31 U.S.C. 3702(b)(1).  The Secretary of Defense \ncan waive the statute of limitations for claims involving \nservice members\u2019 compensation that do not exceed \n$25,000.  31 U.S.C. 3702(e)(1) and (3). \n2. The dispute in this case concerns whether the \nBarring Act\u2019s statute of limitations applies to claims for \nunpaid \u201ccombat-related special compensation\u201d (CRSC).  \nGenerally speaking, retired members of the uniformed \nservices who are entitled to both military retired pay \nfrom the Department of Defense and disability compen-\nsation from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) \nmay not lawfully receive the full amount of both their \nretired pay and their disability compensation.  38 U.S.C. \n5304, 5305.  Instead, retired service members who wish \nto receive disability compensation are generally re-\nquired to waive a portion of their military retired pay in \nan amount equal to the amount of disability compensa-\ntion they receive.  38 U.S.C. 5305; but see 10 U.S.C. \n1414.  Retired service members who can establish that \ntheir compensable disability is directly attributable to a \n\u201ccombat-related\u201d event, however, can receive additional \ncompensation up to the amount of their waived retired \npay.  10 U.S.C. 1413a (2018 & Supp. IV 2022).   \nOriginally, this substantive entitlement to CRSC \nwas payable only to individuals who had completed at \nleast 20 years of military service.  See 10 U.S.C. 1413a \n(2006).  But effective January 1, 2008, retirees with \nfewer than 20 years of military service are eligible for \nCRSC if they were medically retired under 10 U.S.C. \n \nfederal civilian employees\u2019 compensation); 31 U.S.C. 3702(a)(4) \n(providing that the Office of Management and Budget has the au-\nthority to settle all claims not delegated elsewhere). \n\n5 \n \n1201-1222.  National Defense Authorization Act for Fis-\ncal Year 2008, Pub. L. No. 110-181, Div. A, Tit. VI, \u00a7 641, \n122 Stat. 156; 10 U.S.C. 1413a(b)(3)(B).   \nThe statute that authorizes CRSC, 10 U.S.C. 1413a, \nstates that \u201c[t]he Secretary concerned shall pay to each \neligible combat-related disabled uniformed services re-\ntiree who elects benefits under this section a monthly \namount for the combat-related disability of the retiree.\u201d  \n10 U.S.C. 1413a(a).  Section 1413a further provides that \nthe Secretary of Defense \u201cshall prescribe procedures \nand criteria under which a disabled uniformed services \nretiree may apply\u201d to be considered \u201can eligible combat-\nrelated disabled uniformed services retiree\u201d and elect \nbenefits.  10 U.S.C. 1413a(d).   \nThose procedures, which are set forth in various reg-\nulations and program guidance, specify that a retired \nservice member must first elect to receive CRSC.   See \n7B U.S. Dep\u2019t of Def., DoD 7000.14-R, Financial Man-\nagement Regulation, Ch. 63, at 63-5 to 63-6 (June 2024).  \nThe appropriate military department will then deter-\nmine whether the service member is eligible, which gen-\nerally requires being in retired status and having a ser-\nvice-connected disability that is rated by the VA as at \nleast 10% disabling.  See id. at 63-6 to 63-9, 63-19.  The \nmilitary department will also determine whether one or \nmore of the applicant\u2019s disabilities are directly attribut-\nable to a combat-related event.  See id. at 63-19.  If \nthose criteria are satisfied, the service member will be \nfound eligible for CRSC, and his or her application will \nbe forwarded to the Defense Finance and Accounting \nService for payment.  See ibid.  \n3. a. Petitioner Simon Soto is a retired member of \nthe United States Marine Corps with a combat-related \ndisability rated at least 10% disabling.  Pet. App. 4a.  In \n\n6 \n \nApril 2006 petitioner was medically retired from active \nduty with less than 20 years of military service.  Ibid.  \nAlthough he met the eligibility criteria for CRSC as of \nJune 2009\u2014when he received his disability rating from \nthe VA\u2014he did not apply and elect to receive CRSC un-\ntil seven years later, in June 2016.  Ibid.   \nIn October 2016, the Navy determined that peti-\ntioner\u2019s disability was combat-related and that he was \nentitled to CRSC payments for the months following his \nJune 2016 application and election.  Pet. App. 22a.  The \nNavy also informed petitioner that, even for the period \nbefore June 2016, petitioner could receive retroactive \nCRSC payments for months in which he met the eligi-\nbility criteria, but that those payments would be limited \nby the Barring Act\u2019s six-year statute of limitations.  \nIbid.  Petitioner did not request a waiver pursuant to 31 \nU.S.C. 3702(e)(1) of the six-year time limit.  Pet. App. \n4a.  As a result, petitioner received six years of retroac-\ntive CRSC payments covering the period from July \n2010 to June 2016.  Ibid. \nb. In March 2017, petitioner filed a class-action suit \nin the United States District Court for the Southern \nDistrict of Texas under 28 U.S.C. 1346(a)(2) (the Little \nTucker Act), contending that the Barring Act\u2019s six-year \nstatute of limitations does not apply to claims for CRSC.  \nPet. App. 4a.  Petitioner further argued that no other \nlimitations period was applicable and that he was there-\nfore entitled to retroactive payments dating back to \nJanuary 1, 2008\u2014the effective date of the statute in \nwhich Congress expanded CRSC eligibility, see p. 4,  \nsupra\u2014rather than July 2010.  Pet. App. 4a.   \nThe government moved for judgment on the plead-\nings.  The district court denied the motion, holding that \nthe CRSC-authorization statute, Section 1413a, is a \n\n7 \n \n\u201cspecific\u201d statute that supersedes the generally applica-\nble terms of the Barring Act.  D. Ct. Doc. 39, at 5 (Aug. \n31, 2017) (citation omitted).  The court subsequently \ncertified a class of all \u201c[f]ormer service members of the \nUnited States Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force, or \nCoast Guard  * * *  whose amount of CRSC payment \nwas limited by\u201d the Barring Act\u2019s six-year statute of \nlimitations and who have \u201cclaim[s] of less than $10,000.\u201d  \nPet. App. 31a; see id. at 21a-31a.  The court then \ngranted summary judgment for the plaintiffs, reiterat-\ning its prior view that Section 1413a contains its own \n\u201csettlement mechanism.\u201d  Id. at 35a; see id. at 32a-37a.  \nIn support of that conclusion, the court stated that Sec-\ntion 1413a \u201cdefines eligibility for CRSC, helps explain \nthe amount of benefits and instructs the Secretary of \nDefense to prescribe procedures and criteria for indi-\nviduals to apply for CRSC.\u201d  Id. at 35a-36a. \nc. The court of appeals reversed.  Pet. App. 1a-19a.    \nThe court explained that Section 1413a establishes \u201cwho \nmay be eligible for CRSC payments,\u201d not how claimants \ncan have claims for unpaid compensation determined \nand settled.  Id. at 7a.  The court observed that\u2014unlike \nother statutes that displace the Barring Act\u2014Section \n1413a does not contain \u201cspecific language authorizing \nthe Secretary of Defense to settle a claim\u201d for unpaid \ncompensation,\u201d which the court noted \u201cwill typically be \ndone by use of the term \u2018settle.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Ibid.; see id. at 6a-7a.  \nThe court further observed that Section 1413a does not \ncontain a \u201c\u200a\u2018specific\u2019 provision setting out the period of \nrecovery.\u201d  Id. at 7a.  Having determined that \u201c[t]he \nCRSC statute lacks the sort of clear language authoriz-\ning the Secretary to settle CRSC claims sufficient for \nan exception to the Barring Act,\u201d the court of appeals \nheld that Section 1413a does not displace the Act\u2019s \n\n8 \n \ngenerally applicable claims-settlement procedures, in-\ncluding its six-year statute of limitations.  Id. at 8a. \nJudge Reyna dissented.  He would have held that \nSection 1413a displaces the Barring Act because Sec-\ntion 1413a defines which retirees are eligible for CRSC \npayments and specifies the monthly amount that shall \nbe paid to those retirees.  Pet. App. 12a-19a. \nARGUMENT \nThe court of appeals held that the Secretary of De-\nfense\u2019s authority to settle claims for unpaid amounts of \nCRSC\u2014like the Secretary\u2019s authority to settle claims \nfor other forms of military pay and benefits\u2014is subject \nto the Barring Act\u2019s six-year statute of limitations.  \nThat decision is correct and does not conflict with any \ndecision of this Court or of another court of appeals.  \nThe petition for a writ of certiorari should be denied.  \n1. Petitioner contends (Pet. 15-16) that 10 U.S.C. \n1413a (which authorizes the payment of CRSC) is \u201can-\nother law\u201d that displaces the Barring Act, 31 U.S.C. \n3702(a), and that the Secretary therefore may settle \nclaims for unpaid retroactive CRSC without regard to \nthe Barring Act\u2019s six-year statute of limitations.  The \ncourt of appeals correctly rejected that argument.  \nNothing in the text of Section 1413a or any other provi-\nsion of law supersedes the six-year limit that the Bar-\nring Act imposes on the Secretary of Defense\u2019s author-\nity to settle claims for unpaid military compensation.   \nWhen Congress has elected to displace the Barring \nAct\u2019s generally applicable settlement procedures or the \nAct\u2019s statute of limitations, it has done so expressly.  \nSee Pet. App. 6a-7a.  Under the Federal Tort Claims \nAct, 28 U.S.C. 2671 et seq., for example, the authority to \nadministratively \u201csettle\u201d a tort claim belongs to the \nagency from whose operations the claim arose, subject \n\n9 \n \nto a two-year statute of limitations.  28 U.S.C. 2672; see \n28 U.S.C. 2401(b); see also 10 U.S.C. 2733 (2018 & Supp. \nIV 2022) (authorizing the Secretary of Defense to \u201cset-\ntle\u201d certain tort claims arising under the Military \nClaims Act, 10 U.S.C. 2731 et seq., subject to a two-year \nstatute of limitations); 39 U.S.C. 401(8) (authorizing the \nUnited States Postal Service to \u201csettle\u201d claims that \narise out of its operations).  Such express grants of set-\ntlement authority and specific limitations periods ren-\nder the Barring Act\u2019s conflicting provisions inapplica-\nble.  See GAO Red Book 14-21 to 14-23 (listing other \nstatutes). \nBy contrast, the statute that authorizes CRSC \u201ccon-\nveys no [settlement] authority.\u201d  Pet. App. 7a.  That \nstatute defines which individuals are eligible to elect \nCRSC payments, 10 U.S.C. 1413a(a), (c), and (e), and \nspecifies the monthly amount they may receive, 10 \nU.S.C. 1413a(b).  But the statute contains no language \nthat is naturally understood to create an administrative \nprocess to settle claims for unpaid amounts, or any pro-\nvision that otherwise conflicts with the Barring Act\u2019s \nconferral of settlement authority or its six-year statute \nof limitations.  The statute does not, for example, spec-\nify when claims for unpaid CRSC must be submitted or \nwho is authorized to make a final determination regard-\ning the total amount for which the United States is lia-\nble.  Indeed, the words \u201csettle\u201d and \u201cclaim\u201d do not ap-\npear in Section 1413a.     \nPetitioner nevertheless argues (Pet. 16) that Section \n1413a conveys freestanding settlement authority.  Peti-\ntioner draws that inference from the statutory provi-\nsions that require the Secretary to create procedures \nand criteria to determine whether a disabled uniformed \nservices retiree is \u201cconsidered to be an eligible combat-\n\n10 \n \nrelated disabled uniformed services retiree,\u201d 10 U.S.C. \n1413a(d), and that direct the Secretary to make a spe-\ncific type of monthly payment to eligible individuals who \nelect that benefit, 10 U.S.C. 1413a(a).3  But those provi-\nsions \u201cestablish a veteran\u2019s substantive right to CRSC \nand authorize its payment,\u201d Pet. App. 8a; they do not \naddress \u201chow eligible claims may be settled,\u201d id. at 7a \n(emphasis added).  As with other forms of military com-\npensation, the Secretary\u2019s authority to make a final ad-\nministrative determination about the government\u2019s to-\ntal liability to individuals who submit claims for unpaid \namounts of CRSC arises out of the Barring Act, subject \nto that law\u2019s terms and limitations.  See GAO Red Book \n14-26 (explaining that the Barring Act provides \u201cthe \nprocedural authority to settle claims administratively\u201d \nwhenever the \u201csubstantive criteria upon which\u201d the \nclaim is \n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n2: 20241120144147968_CERTIFICATE2024-32020SOTO.json (score: 0.455)\nNo.  24-320 \n   \nIN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES  \n  \n  \n _________________  \n \nSIMON A.

In this context, the term \u201csettle\u201d means to make \na final administrative determination regarding the gov-\nernment\u2019s total liability on a claim.  See Illinois Sur. Co. \nv. United States, 240 U.S. 214, 219 (1916).  The Barring \nAct specifies which officials are authorized to settle the \naccounts of federal employees and when such claims \nmust be presented.  As relevant here, the Act authorizes \nthe Secretary of Defense to settle all claims \u201cinvolving \nuniformed service members\u2019 pay, allowances, travel, \ntransportation, payments for unused accrued leave, re-\ntired pay, and survivor benefits.\u201d  31 U.S.C. 3702(a)(1)(A).  \nThat authority is subject to a six-year time limit for sub-\nmitting claims, 31 U.S.C. 3702(b)(1), which the Secre-\ntary may waive for claims that do not exceed $25,000,  \n31 U.S.C. 3702(e)(1) and (3). \nAt issue in this case are claims for allegedly unpaid \ncombat-related special compensation (CRSC), which is \na compensation available only to retired uniformed ser-\nvice members with combat-related disabilities who elect \nbenefits under 10 U.S.C. 1413a (2018 & Supp. IV 2022).  \nThe Department of Defense has exercised its authority \nunder the Barring Act to settle petitioner\u2019s claims for \nretroactive payment of CRSC, subject to a six-year pay-\nment cap in light of the Barring Act\u2019s claim-submission \ndeadline.  The question presented is as follows: \nWhether 10 U.S.C. 1413a displaces the settlement \nprocedures and limitations set forth in the Barring Act.   \n \n\n(III) \nTABLE OF CONTENTS \nPage\nOpinions below .............................................................................. 1 \nJurisdiction .................................................................................... 1 \nStatement ...................................................................................... 1 \nArgument ....................................................................................... 8 \nConclusion ................................................................................... 17 \nTABLE OF AUTHORITIES \nCases: \nJoseph M.

App. 1a-19a) \nis reported at 92 F.4th 1094.  The order of the district \ncourt (Pet. App. 32a-37a) is available at 2021 WL \n7286022.  A prior order of the district court (Pet. App. \n21a-31a) is unreported. \nJURISDICTION \nThe judgment of the court of appeals (Pet. App. 20a) \nwas entered on February 12, 2024.  A petition for re-\nhearing was denied on June 20, 2024 (Pet. App. 40a-\n41a).  The petition for a writ of certiorari was filed on \nSeptember 18, 2024.  The jurisdiction of this Court is \ninvoked under 28 U.S.C. 1254(1).  \nSTATEMENT \n1. The Barring Act, 31 U.S.C. 3702, provides a com-\nprehensive remedy for the settlement of claims \u201cof or \n\n2 \n \nagainst the United States\u201d except where that law is su-\nperseded by another, more specific claims-settlement \nstatute.  31 U.S.C. 3702(a); see 3 Office of the Gen. \nCounsel, U.S. Gen. Accounting Office (GAO), GAO-08-\n978SP, Principles of Federal Appropriations Law 14-\n23 to 14-28 (3d ed., rev. vol. 2016) (GAO Red Book).  The \nterm \u201csettle\u201d in this context means to make a final ad-\nministrative determination regarding the government\u2019s \ntotal liability on a claim\u2014that is, to determine the spe-\ncific amount owed to an individual under the terms of \nfederal contracts or statutory provisions, including any \napplicable adjustments and offsets.  See Illinois Sur. \nCo. v. United States, 240 U.S. 214, 219 (1916).  As origi-\nnally enacted, the settlement authority conferred by the \nBarring Act \u201cwas not only comprehensive but exclu-\nsive,\u201d so that all claims and accounts concerning the \nUnited States would be \u201csettled and adjusted in the \nTreasury Department.\u201d  GAO Red Book 14-23 (quoting \nAct of Mar. 3, 1817, ch. 45, \u00a7 2, 3 Stat. 366).  Since then, \nCongress has enacted several amendments to this broad \ngrant of settlement authority.  Three of those amend-\nments are relevant here. \nFirst, Congress has amended the Barring Act to \ntransfer claims-settlement responsibility from the Treas-\nury Department to various other agencies, depending \non the nature of the claim involved.  See 31 U.S.C. \n3702(a)(1)-(4); see generally GAO Red Book 14-23 to 14-\n24 (detailing the history of such transfers).   \nSecond, Congress established a six-year deadline for \nthe submission of claims falling within the Barring Act\u2019s \nscope.  See GAO Act of 1974, Pub. L. No. 93-604, \u00a7 801, \n88 Stat. 1965.  That amendment conformed the Barring \nAct \u201cto the 6-year limitation period applicable to judicial \nactions on claims against the United States under 28 \n\n3 \n \nU.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2401 and 2501,\u201d and the amendment\u2019s legisla-\ntive history \u201cnoted that \u2018[t]his will make the time limi-\ntation consistent with the Statute of Limitations now \napplicable to claims filed in administrative agencies and \nthe courts.\u2019\u200a\u201d  In re Joseph M. Ford, 73 Comp. Gen. 157, \n161 (1994) (quoting S. Rep. No. 1314, 93d Cong., 2d \nSess. 5-6 (1974)) (brackets in original).1  Agencies are \nnot permitted to waive or extend this six-year statute of \nlimitations except where a statute expressly authorizes \nthat step.  See GAO Red Book 14-28 to 14-29. \nThird, the Barring Act\u2019s administrative claims- \nsettlement authority is no longer exclusive.  Over the \nyears, Congress has enacted various laws that ex-\npressly authorize specific agencies to settle certain \nclaims that arise out of the agency\u2019s operations, and \nthose specific claims-settlement procedures supersede \nthe Barring Act\u2019s generally applicable provisions.  See \nGAO Red Book 14-21 to 14-23 (listing statutes that per-\nmit agencies to settle claims administratively).  The \nBarring Act\u2019s directive regarding who has final author-\nity to settle claims of or against the United States, and \nwhen those claims must be presented, are thus provi-\nsions of general applicability that govern \u201c[e]xcept as \nprovided in this chapter or another law.\u201d  31 U.S.C. \n3702(a). \nAs relevant here, the Barring Act vests in the Secre-\ntary of Defense the authority to settle all claims \u201cinvolv-\ning uniformed service members\u2019 pay, allowances, travel, \ntransportation, payments for unused accrued leave, retired \npay, and survivor benefits.\u201d  31 U.S.C. 3702(a)(1)(A).2  \n \n1  Before the 1974 amendment, the Barring Act\u2019s statute of limita-\ntions was ten years.  See Ford, 73 Comp. Gen. at 161. \n2  See 31 U.S.C. 3702(a)(2) (similarly delegating to the Office of \nPersonnel Management the authority to settle claims involving  \n\n4 \n \nSuch claims must be presented \u201cwithin 6 years after the \nclaim accrues,\u201d however, subject to enumerated excep-\ntions.  31 U.S.C. 3702(b)(1).  The Secretary of Defense \ncan waive the statute of limitations for claims involving \nservice members\u2019 compensation that do not exceed \n$25,000.  31 U.S.C. 3702(e)(1) and (3). \n2. The dispute in this case concerns whether the \nBarring Act\u2019s statute of limitations applies to claims for \nunpaid \u201ccombat-related special compensation\u201d (CRSC).  \nGenerally speaking, retired members of the uniformed \nservices who are entitled to both military retired pay \nfrom the Department of Defense and disability compen-\nsation from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) \nmay not lawfully receive the full amount of both their \nretired pay and their disability compensation.  38 U.S.C. \n5304, 5305.  Instead, retired service members who wish \nto receive disability compensation are generally re-\nquired to waive a portion of their military retired pay in \nan amount equal to the amount of disability compensa-\ntion they receive.  38 U.S.C. 5305; but see 10 U.S.C. \n1414.  Retired service members who can establish that \ntheir compensable disability is directly attributable to a \n\u201ccombat-related\u201d event, however, can receive additional \ncompensation up to the amount of their waived retired \npay.  10 U.S.C. 1413a (2018 & Supp. IV 2022).   \nOriginally, this substantive entitlement to CRSC \nwas payable only to individuals who had completed at \nleast 20 years of military service.  See 10 U.S.C. 1413a \n(2006).  But effective January 1, 2008, retirees with \nfewer than 20 years of military service are eligible for \nCRSC if they were medically retired under 10 U.S.C. \n \nfederal civilian employees\u2019 compensation); 31 U.S.C. 3702(a)(4) \n(providing that the Office of Management and Budget has the au-\nthority to settle all claims not delegated elsewhere). \n\n5 \n \n1201-1222.  National Defense Authorization Act for Fis-\ncal Year 2008, Pub. L. No. 110-181, Div. A, Tit. VI, \u00a7 641, \n122 Stat. 156; 10 U.S.C. 1413a(b)(3)(B).   \nThe statute that authorizes CRSC, 10 U.S.C. 1413a, \nstates that \u201c[t]he Secretary concerned shall pay to each \neligible combat-related disabled uniformed services re-\ntiree who elects benefits under this section a monthly \namount for the combat-related disability of the retiree.\u201d  \n10 U.S.C. 1413a(a).  Section 1413a further provides that \nthe Secretary of Defense \u201cshall prescribe procedures \nand criteria under which a disabled uniformed services \nretiree may apply\u201d to be considered \u201can eligible combat-\nrelated disabled uniformed services retiree\u201d and elect \nbenefits.  10 U.S.C. 1413a(d).   \nThose procedures, which are set forth in various reg-\nulations and program guidance, specify that a retired \nservice member must first elect to receive CRSC.   See \n7B U.S. Dep\u2019t of Def., DoD 7000.14-R, Financial Man-\nagement Regulation, Ch. 63, at 63-5 to 63-6 (June 2024).  \nThe appropriate military department will then deter-\nmine whether the service member is eligible, which gen-\nerally requires being in retired status and having a ser-\nvice-connected disability that is rated by the VA as at \nleast 10% disabling.  See id. at 63-6 to 63-9, 63-19.  The \nmilitary department will also determine whether one or \nmore of the applicant\u2019s disabilities are directly attribut-\nable to a combat-related event.  See id. at 63-19.  If \nthose criteria are satisfied, the service member will be \nfound eligible for CRSC, and his or her application will \nbe forwarded to the Defense Finance and Accounting \nService for payment.  See ibid.  \n3. a. Petitioner Simon Soto is a retired member of \nthe United States Marine Corps with a combat-related \ndisability rated at least 10% disabling.  Pet. App. 4a.  In \n\n6 \n \nApril 2006 petitioner was medically retired from active \nduty with less than 20 years of military service.  Ibid.  \nAlthough he met the eligibility criteria for CRSC as of \nJune 2009\u2014when he received his disability rating from \nthe VA\u2014he did not apply and elect to receive CRSC un-\ntil seven years later, in June 2016.  Ibid.   \nIn October 2016, the Navy determined that peti-\ntioner\u2019s disability was combat-related and that he was \nentitled to CRSC payments for the months following his \nJune 2016 application and election.  Pet. App. 22a.  The \nNavy also informed petitioner that, even for the period \nbefore June 2016, petitioner could receive retroactive \nCRSC payments for months in which he met the eligi-\nbility criteria, but that those payments would be limited \nby the Barring Act\u2019s six-year statute of limitations.  \nIbid.  Petitioner did not request a waiver pursuant to 31 \nU.S.C. 3702(e)(1) of the six-year time limit.  Pet. App. \n4a.  As a result, petitioner received six years of retroac-\ntive CRSC payments covering the period from July \n2010 to June 2016.  Ibid. \nb. In March 2017, petitioner filed a class-action suit \nin the United States District Court for the Southern \nDistrict of Texas under 28 U.S.C. 1346(a)(2) (the Little \nTucker Act), contending that the Barring Act\u2019s six-year \nstatute of limitations does not apply to claims for CRSC.  \nPet. App. 4a.  Petitioner further argued that no other \nlimitations period was applicable and that he was there-\nfore entitled to retroactive payments dating back to \nJanuary 1, 2008\u2014the effective date of the statute in \nwhich Congress expanded CRSC eligibility, see p. 4,  \nsupra\u2014rather than July 2010.  Pet. App. 4a.   \nThe government moved for judgment on the plead-\nings.  The district court denied the motion, holding that \nthe CRSC-authorization statute, Section 1413a, is a \n\n7 \n \n\u201cspecific\u201d statute that supersedes the generally applica-\nble terms of the Barring Act.  D. Ct. Doc. 39, at 5 (Aug. \n31, 2017) (citation omitted).  The court subsequently \ncertified a class of all \u201c[f]ormer service members of the \nUnited States Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force, or \nCoast Guard  * * *  whose amount of CRSC payment \nwas limited by\u201d the Barring Act\u2019s six-year statute of \nlimitations and who have \u201cclaim[s] of less than $10,000.\u201d  \nPet. App. 31a; see id. at 21a-31a.  The court then \ngranted summary judgment for the plaintiffs, reiterat-\ning its prior view that Section 1413a contains its own \n\u201csettlement mechanism.\u201d  Id. at 35a; see id. at 32a-37a.  \nIn support of that conclusion, the court stated that Sec-\ntion 1413a \u201cdefines eligibility for CRSC, helps explain \nthe amount of benefits and instructs the Secretary of \nDefense to prescribe procedures and criteria for indi-\nviduals to apply for CRSC.\u201d  Id. at 35a-36a. \nc. The court of appeals reversed.  Pet. App. 1a-19a.    \nThe court explained that Section 1413a establishes \u201cwho \nmay be eligible for CRSC payments,\u201d not how claimants \ncan have claims for unpaid compensation determined \nand settled.  Id. at 7a.  The court observed that\u2014unlike \nother statutes that displace the Barring Act\u2014Section \n1413a does not contain \u201cspecific language authorizing \nthe Secretary of Defense to settle a claim\u201d for unpaid \ncompensation,\u201d which the court noted \u201cwill typically be \ndone by use of the term \u2018settle.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Ibid.; see id. at 6a-7a.  \nThe court further observed that Section 1413a does not \ncontain a \u201c\u200a\u2018specific\u2019 provision setting out the period of \nrecovery.\u201d  Id. at 7a.  Having determined that \u201c[t]he \nCRSC statute lacks the sort of clear language authoriz-\ning the Secretary to settle CRSC claims sufficient for \nan exception to the Barring Act,\u201d the court of appeals \nheld that Section 1413a does not displace the Act\u2019s \n\n8 \n \ngenerally applicable claims-settlement procedures, in-\ncluding its six-year statute of limitations.  Id. at 8a. \nJudge Reyna dissented.  He would have held that \nSection 1413a displaces the Barring Act because Sec-\ntion 1413a defines which retirees are eligible for CRSC \npayments and specifies the monthly amount that shall \nbe paid to those retirees.  Pet. App. 12a-19a. \nARGUMENT \nThe court of appeals held that the Secretary of De-\nfense\u2019s authority to settle claims for unpaid amounts of \nCRSC\u2014like the Secretary\u2019s authority to settle claims \nfor other forms of military pay and benefits\u2014is subject \nto the Barring Act\u2019s six-year statute of limitations.  \nThat decision is correct and does not conflict with any \ndecision of this Court or of another court of appeals.  \nThe petition for a writ of certiorari should be denied.  \n1. Petitioner contends (Pet. 15-16) that 10 U.S.C. \n1413a (which authorizes the payment of CRSC) is \u201can-\nother law\u201d that displaces the Barring Act, 31 U.S.C. \n3702(a), and that the Secretary therefore may settle \nclaims for unpaid retroactive CRSC without regard to \nthe Barring Act\u2019s six-year statute of limitations.  The \ncourt of appeals correctly rejected that argument.  \nNothing in the text of Section 1413a or any other provi-\nsion of law supersedes the six-year limit that the Bar-\nring Act imposes on the Secretary of Defense\u2019s author-\nity to settle claims for unpaid military compensation.   \nWhen Congress has elected to displace the Barring \nAct\u2019s generally applicable settlement procedures or the \nAct\u2019s statute of limitations, it has done so expressly.  \nSee Pet. App. 6a-7a.  Under the Federal Tort Claims \nAct, 28 U.S.C. 2671 et seq., for example, the authority to \nadministratively \u201csettle\u201d a tort claim belongs to the \nagency from whose operations the claim arose, subject \n\n9 \n \nto a two-year statute of limitations.  28 U.S.C. 2672; see \n28 U.S.C. 2401(b); see also 10 U.S.C. 2733 (2018 & Supp. \nIV 2022) (authorizing the Secretary of Defense to \u201cset-\ntle\u201d certain tort claims arising under the Military \nClaims Act, 10 U.S.C. 2731 et seq., subject to a two-year \nstatute of limitations); 39 U.S.C. 401(8) (authorizing the \nUnited States Postal Service to \u201csettle\u201d claims that \narise out of its operations).  Such express grants of set-\ntlement authority and specific limitations periods ren-\nder the Barring Act\u2019s conflicting provisions inapplica-\nble.  See GAO Red Book 14-21 to 14-23 (listing other \nstatutes). \nBy contrast, the statute that authorizes CRSC \u201ccon-\nveys no [settlement] authority.\u201d  Pet. App. 7a.  That \nstatute defines which individuals are eligible to elect \nCRSC payments, 10 U.S.C. 1413a(a), (c), and (e), and \nspecifies the monthly amount they may receive, 10 \nU.S.C. 1413a(b).  But the statute contains no language \nthat is naturally understood to create an administrative \nprocess to settle claims for unpaid amounts, or any pro-\nvision that otherwise conflicts with the Barring Act\u2019s \nconferral of settlement authority or its six-year statute \nof limitations.  The statute does not, for example, spec-\nify when claims for unpaid CRSC must be submitted or \nwho is authorized to make a final determination regard-\ning the total amount for which the United States is lia-\nble.  Indeed, the words \u201csettle\u201d and \u201cclaim\u201d do not ap-\npear in Section 1413a.     \nPetitioner nevertheless argues (Pet. 16) that Section \n1413a conveys freestanding settlement authority.  Peti-\ntioner draws that inference from the statutory provi-\nsions that require the Secretary to create procedures \nand criteria to determine whether a disabled uniformed \nservices retiree is \u201cconsidered to be an eligible combat-\n\n10 \n \nrelated disabled uniformed services retiree,\u201d 10 U.S.C. \n1413a(d), and that direct the Secretary to make a spe-\ncific type of monthly payment to eligible individuals who \nelect that benefit, 10 U.S.C. 1413a(a).3  But those provi-\nsions \u201cestablish a veteran\u2019s substantive right to CRSC \nand authorize its payment,\u201d Pet. App. 8a; they do not \naddress \u201chow eligible claims may be settled,\u201d id. at 7a \n(emphasis added).  As with other forms of military com-\npensation, the Secretary\u2019s authority to make a final ad-\nministrative determination about the government\u2019s to-\ntal liability to individuals who submit claims for unpaid \namounts of CRSC arises out of the Barring Act, subject \nto that law\u2019s terms and limitations.  See GAO Red Book \n14-26 (explaining that the Barring Act provides \u201cthe \nprocedural authority to settle claims administratively\u201d \nwhenever the \u201csubstantive criteria upon which\u201d the \nclaim is based are specified by another provision of law).  \nPetitioner\u2019s view that Section 1413a implicitly in-\ncludes its own settlement mechanism for unpaid claims \nwould render Section 3702(a)(1)(A)\u2014the Barring Act \nprovision that grants the Secretary of Defense settle-\nment authority over \u201cclaims involving\u201d specific kinds of \n\u201cuniformed service members\u2019 pay\u201d and other benefits\u2014\na virtual nullity.  31 U.S.C. 3702(a)(1)(A).  Because Sec-\ntion 3702(a)(1)(A) does not itself establish substantive \ncriteria for determining whether particular service \nmembers are entitled to payment, every form of mili-\ntary \u201cpay, allowances, travel, transportation, payments \n \n3 Petitioner also notes (Pet. 16) that 10 U.S.C. 1413a(h) (Supp. IV \n2022) identifies the appropriated funds that may be used to pay \nCRSC.  But he does not explain why this specification of the source \nof funding would displace the Barring Act\u2019s settlement mechanisms \nand corresponding six-year statute of limitations for claims involv-\ning unpaid amounts.    \n\n11 \n \nfor unused accrued leave, retired pay, and survivor ben-\nefits,\u201d 31 U.S.C. 3702(a)(1)(A), depends on other statu-\ntory provisions that, like Section 1413a, specify who is \neligible for compensation and in what amount.  See, e.g., \n10 U.S.C. 1401, 12731, and 12739 (2018 & Supp. IV 2022) \n(retired pay); 10 U.S.C.1448, 1451 (2018 & Supp. IV \n2022) (survivor annuities); 37 U.S.C. 204 (basic pay); 37 \nU.S.C. 302-308 (special pay).  If these commonplace fea-\ntures of statutes that establish substantive rights to \npayment displaced the Barring Act\u2019s settlement proce-\ndures, those procedures would almost never apply to \nclaims involving unpaid amounts of military compensa-\ntion.   \nThe Barring Act\u2019s statute of limitations was origi-\nnally enacted to address the recognized problem of stale \nclaims submitted by veterans and federal employees \nseeking back pay or allowances \u201cnot infrequently from \n10 to 25 years after the rights of the claimants arose,\u201d \nand occasionally \u201c50 to 100 years after they first ac-\ncrued.\u201d  S. Rep. No. 1338, 76th Cong., 3d Sess. 2 (1940).  \nReports accompanying the legislation noted the signifi-\ncant costs associated with evaluating such stale claims, \nmost of which lacked merit.  See id. at 2-3; H.R. Rep. \nNo. 1541, 76th Cong., 3d Sess. 2 (1940) (1940 House Re-\nport).  Because the attendant effort was \u201cso great as to \nmake it prejudicial to the interests of the United \nStates,\u201d 1940 House Report 2, Congress has barred con-\nsideration of claims that are not timely submitted, un-\nless an exception applies or a statute provides other-\nwise.  But under petitioner\u2019s view that the CRSC stat-\nute contains its own settlement mechanism but no tem-\nporal limit on claims, disabled uniform service retirees \nwho believe that the Department of Defense has miscal-\nculated or missed a prior CRSC payment could wait \n\n12 \n \nindefinitely before alerting the Department to its pur-\nported error.  Petitioner identifies no basis for distin-\nguishing the CRSC statute from the provisions that \ngovern other forms of military compensation, or for rec-\nonciling his view of the law with Congress\u2019s intent in en-\nacting the Barring Act.   \n2. The question presented does not meet this Court\u2019s \ncriteria for certiorari.  See Sup. Ct. R. 10. \na. Contrary to petitioner\u2019s characterization (Pet. 15-\n16), the court of appeals\u2019 decision is fully consistent with \nthis Court\u2019s understanding of the term \u201csettlement\u201d in \nIllinois Surety Co. v. United States, 240 U.S. 214 (1916).  \nSee id. at 219 (defining \u201csettlement\u201d to mean \u201cadminis-\ntrative determination of the amount due\u201d).  The court of \nappeals here acknowledged that, in the context of public \ntransactions and accounts, the term \u201csettlement\u201d refers \nto the authority to \u201c\u200a\u2018administratively determine the va-\nlidity of [a] claim\u2019\u200a\u201d and make a final determination of \nthe amount of the government\u2019s liability to the claimant.  \nPet. App. 3a n.1 (citation omitted). \nApplying that definition and using ordinary tools of \nstatutory construction, the court of appeals concluded \nthat, while Section 1413a directs the Secretary of De-\nfense to pay CRSC to eligible individuals who elect that \nbenefit, it \u201cdo[es] not authorize the Secretary to \u2018admin-\nistratively determine the validity\u2019 of a claim\u201d for unpaid \nfunds.  Pet. App. 8a (citation omitted).  To the extent \nthat Illinois Surety is relevant here, it supports the dis-\ntinction the panel drew between those two concepts.  \nThe Illinois Surety Court observed that the \u201cpivotal \nwords\u201d in the statute at issue were \u201cnot \u2018final payment,\u2019 \nbut \u2018final settlement\u2019 and in view of the significance of \nthe latter term in administrative practice, it is hardly \nlikely that it would have been used had it been intended \n\n13 \n \nto denote payment.\u201d  240 U.S. at 218-219; see Pet. App. \n7a.  The court of appeals\u2019 determination\u2014which was \nbased on the specific language of Section 1413a, a pro-\nvision that was not at issue in Illinois Surety\u2014does not \nconflict with the holding or reasoning of that decision.   \nb.  The decision below also does not conflict with any \ndecision of another court of appeals.  Cf. Pet. 17.  Peti-\ntioner argues (Pet. 12-15) that this Court\u2019s review is \nwarranted because the court of appeals\u2019 analysis may \nrequire agencies to reassess other statutory delegations \nof claims-settlement authority.  But petitioner\u2019s specu-\nlation that agencies will have to reconsider prior deci-\nsions involving unrelated statutes is unfounded.  In-\ndeed, although petitioner contends that the decision be-\nlow will cause a \u201csea change\u201d (Pet. 13), he identifies only \ntwo agency decisions that he believes are inconsistent \nwith it.  Nothing in those decisions is inconsistent with \nthe court of appeals\u2019 interpretation of Section 1413a.   \n Petitioner first relies (Pet. 13) upon the decision of \nthe Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) in Lee v. \nDepartment of Justice, 99 M.S.P.R. 256 (2005), in which \nthe MSPB held that it has authority to order back pay \nas compensation for violations of the Uniformed Ser-\nvices Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of \n1994 (USERRA), 38 U.S.C. 4301 et seq.  The MSPB \nreached that conclusion based on USERRA\u2019s language \n\u201cspecifically authoriz[ing]\u201d the MSPB \u201cto order com-\npensation for \u2018any loss of wages or benefits\u2019 resulting \nfrom any USERRA violation that occurred on or after\u201d \nUSERRA\u2019s effective date.  Lee, 99 M.S.P.R. at 265 \n(quoting 38 U.S.C. 4324(c)).  The MSPB further con-\ncluded that this express authority to award back pay \nwas not limited by either the Barring Act or the six-year \nlimitation on recovery in the Back Pay Act of 1966,  \n\n14 \n \n5 U.S.C. 5596(b)(4), because the MSPB has \u201cexclusive\u201d \njurisdiction under 38 U.S.C. 4324(c) to adjudicate \nUSERRA claims without regard to when a particular \nclaim accrued.  Lee, 99 M.S.P.R. at 265; see id. at 265-\n266, 268; see also Hernandez v. Department of the Air \nForce, 498 F.3d 1328, 1331 & n.1 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (stat-\ning that USERRA claims are \u201cgoverned exclusively\u201d by \nUSERRA\u2019s specific directive that the MSPB may adju-\ndicate such claims \u201c\u200a\u2018without regard as to\u2019\u200a\u201d whether \nthey accrued before or after USERRA\u2019s effective date) \n(citation omitted).  But as the court of appeals here rec-\nognized, Section 1413a contains no equivalent back pay, \njurisdictional, or timing provisions.  See Pet. App. 7a.4 \nThe court of appeals\u2019 analysis is also fully consistent \nwith the assessment of the Office of Personnel Manage-\nment (OPM) of the claim in File No. S001855.2, 1999 \nOPM Dec. LEXIS 338 (June 16, 1999) (see Pet. 13).  In \nthat instance, an individual who had previously been \nemployed as a police officer at an unnamed agency filed \na claim with OPM challenging the lawfulness of the ex-\npiration of his temporary appointment.  Id. at *1.  OPM \ndismissed that claim for lack of jurisdiction, noting that \nchallenges to the lawfulness of a separation under the \nCivil Service Reform Act of 1978 must be presented to \nthe employing agency, subject to appeal before the \nMSPB.  Id. at *2 (citing 5 U.S.C. 7513).  In other words, \na separate statute dictated a process for resolving a \n \n4 Petitioner contends (Pet. 13 n.2) that he relies on Lee only for \nthat decision\u2019s discussion of the Back Pay Act.  His point is unclear.  \nIn the portion of Lee that petitioner cites, the MSPB assessed its \nremedial authority under USERRA.  See 99 M.S.P.R. at 265.  The \nMSPB then held that the Back Pay Act, with its attendant \u201c6-year \nlimitation on recovery,\u201d also \u201cdoes not control the remedy in a \nUSERRA case.\u201d  Lee, 99 M.S.P.R. at 268-269.   \n\n15 \n \nparticular kind of claim, and OPM concluded that this \nconflicting provision displaced OPM\u2019s authority to ren-\nder a final determination under the Barring Act, 31 \nU.S.C. 3702(a).  But petitioner identifies no comparable \nlanguage in Section 1413a.   \nPetitioner\u2019s reliance (Pet. 13-14) on 10 U.S.C. 7712 is \nsimilarly unavailing.  Petitioner identifies no judicial or \nagency decision supporting his view that this statute\u2014\nwhich generally addresses how to treat proceeds of the \neffects of persons who die in locations under Army  \njurisdiction\u2014gives the Department of Defense free-\nstanding settlement authority apart from the Barring \nAct.  Like Section 1413a, Section 7712 does not ex-\npressly confer authority to \u201csettle\u201d and does not refer-\nence \u201cclaims\u201d of any kind. \nPetitioner notes (Pet. 13) that a prior version of the \nstatute directed the Army to \u201cmake a full report of the \ntransactions under this section  * * *  for transmission \nto the General Accounting Office for action authorized \nin the settlement of accounts of deceased members of \nthe Army.\u201d  10 U.S.C. 4712(g) (1994).  But that merely \nreflects the fact that the Comptroller General of the \nGAO previously had authority to settle all claims \nagainst the United States, including the authority to \nsettle the final accounts of deceased military personnel.  \nSee 31 U.S.C. 3702(a) (1994); GAO Red Book 14-23 (ex-\nplaining that the Barring Act\u2019s claims-settlement func-\ntion was transferred from the Treasury Department to \nthe GAO in 1921); see also 10 U.S.C. 2771(a) (designat-\ning the individuals who shall be paid as part of the \u201cset-\ntlement\u201d of the accounts of deceased service members).  \nCongress struck that subsection after it transferred the \nGAO\u2019s settlement functions to the Office of Manage-\nment and Budget (OMB).  See Legislative Branch \n\n16 \n \nAppropriations Act, 1996, Pub. L. No. 104-53, Tit. II,  \n\u00a7 211(a) and (b), 109 Stat. 535; GAO Act of 1996, Pub. L. \nNo. 104-316, \u00a7 202(g), 110 Stat. 3842.   \nIn any event, OMB has delegated to the Department \nof Defense the authority to settle the final accounts of \ndeceased service members.  See OMB, Determination \nwith Respect to Transfer of Functions Pursuant to \nPublic Law 104-53, Attach. A (June 28, 1996); see also \nIn re Transfer of Claims Settlement and Related Ad-\nvance Decisions, Waivers, and Other Functions, 97-1 \nComp. Gen. Proc. Dec. P123, 1997 U.S. Comp. Gen. \nLexis 300, at *9 (Mar. 17, 1997).  There is accordingly \nno doubt that the Department of Defense has authority \nto settle claims involving such accounts, subject to a six-\nyear statute of limitations.  See 32 C.F.R. Pt. 282, App. \nC, Subsec. (f)(1)(ii) (\u201cClaims under 31 U.S.C. 3702(b), 10 \nU.S.C. 2771 and 32 U.S.C. 714 must be received within \n6 years of the date the claim accrued.\u201d).  Petitioner iden-\ntifies nothing in those established procedures that will \nneed to be revisited in light of the court of appeals\u2019 anal-\nysis of Section 1413a.  \nc. Finally, petitioner significantly overstates (Pet. \n10-12) the practical effects of the decision below.  As the \ncourt of appeals noted, \u201cveterans will receive the bene-\nfits they are owed unless [the benefits] accrued outside \nof the Barring Act\u2019s six-year period of recovery.\u201d  92 \nF.4th 1094, 1101 n.4.5  And even for those retired service \nmembers whose claims for payment fall outside the lim-\nitations period, the Barring Act permits the Secretary \nto waive the time limitation for claims that do not ex-\nceed $25,000 if the service member requests such a \nwaiver.  Ibid. (citing 31 U.S.C. 3702(e)); see 32 C.F.R. \n \n5  The petition appendix omits this portion of the court of appeals\u2019 \ndecision.  \n\n17 \n \nPt. 282, App. D, Subsec. (d) (setting forth the process \nfor requesting a waiver).  All of the class members here \nare eligible for waivers under that provision, since the Little \nTucker Act\u2019s amount-in-controversy limit, see 28 U.S.C. \n1346(a)(2), restricts the class to persons with claims for less \nthan $10,000.   \nCONCLUSION \nThe petition for a writ of certiorari should be denied.  \nRespectfully submitted. \n \nELIZABETH B.

          "task_beliefs": "My initial belief state was a tabula rasa, structured only by the basic facts of the *Soto v. United States* case: a conflict between the CRSC statute and the Barring Act's six-year limit, with the District Court siding with Soto and the Federal Circuit reversing. My internal reasoning then decomposed this into a set of targeted inquiries about the core legal tension, the specific arguments for each side, and the role of the pro-veteran canon.\n\nThe observation of the Petitioner's Brief has provided a massive influx of specific information, transforming my understanding of the task from a set of questions into a detailed map of one side's legal strategy. My beliefs have been updated as follows:\n\n-   **Petitioner's Central Argument:** My understanding of the core legal tension is now sharply defined. The petitioner's argument is that the Barring Act (31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3702) is a \"gap-filling\" statute that applies only when no \"[]other law\" provides a mechanism for claim settlement. The petitioner contends that the CRSC statute (10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1413a) is precisely such an \"other law.\"\n-   **Definition of \"Settlement\":** I have learned the petitioner's proposed definition of \"settlement,\" which is central to their case. They argue it is a two-part process: (1) an agency administratively determines the validity of a claim, and (2) the agency determines the amount due.\n-   **Textual and Structural Analysis of the CRSC Statute:** I now have the specific statutory hooks for the petitioner's argument. They claim the CRSC statute provides a complete settlement framework, thereby displacing the Barring Act:\n    -   **Determining Validity:** Section 1413a(d) directs the Secretary to use specific \"procedures and criteria\" to determine a veteran's eligibility, which the petitioner equates to determining the validity of the claim.\n    -   **Determining Amount Due:** Section 1413a(a) and (b) direct the Secretary to \"determine[]\" the monthly payment amount for an eligible veteran.\n-   **Direct Rebuttal of the Federal Circuit:** I now understand the specific errors the petitioner attributes to the Federal Circuit. The petitioner argues the lower court invented an incorrect and overly rigid test for displacing the Barring Act, which wrongly required that a statute must either (a) use the specific word \"settle\" or (b) provide its own independent statute of limitations.\n-   **Key Precedents:** I have identified the key legal precedents the petitioner is relying on. Their argument seems to be built on a foundation of older precedent like *United States v. Corliss Steam-Engine Co.* (1875), which they will argue establishes that explicit use of the word \"settle\" is not required. They also cite recent Supreme Court decisions like *Rudisill v. McDonough* (2024), suggesting they will frame their argument as consistent with the Court's current jurisprudential trends.\n-   **Role of the Pro-Veteran Canon:** My initial focus on the pro-veteran canon has been refined. While the canon is mentioned via case citations (*Rudisill*, *Fishgold*), the petitioner's primary argument as presented in the brief's summary is overwhelmingly textual and structural. This suggests their lead strategy is to persuade the Court on the mechanics of the statutes, potentially holding the canon in reserve as a secondary or tie-breaking argument.\n\nMy confidence in a final prediction remains low, as I have not yet seen the government's counter-arguments. However, my uncertainty is no longer about the petitioner's position; it is now focused on the strength of the respondent's defense of the Federal Circuit's decision and their interpretation of the key precedents.",
          "design_beliefs": "My initial design beliefs established a core methodology: Decompose the problem, prioritize understanding the case-specific arguments (\u03b8) using primary sources, and then build a research agenda. The new observation has both validated this initial methodology and added significant new layers of strategic understanding.\n\n-   **Validation of Core Strategy:** The \"Decomposition,\" \"Strategic Sequencing,\" and \"Source Prioritization\" heuristics have been proven highly effective. By prioritizing the petitioner's brief (a primary source for \u03b8-level information), I have acquired a deep and actionable understanding of the core legal issues, which was the explicit goal of my previous belief state. This confirms that for future SCOTUS cases, obtaining and analyzing the parties' briefs should be the first and most critical information-gathering step.\n-   **New Heuristic - Argument Prioritization:** The structure of the petitioner's brief provides a powerful signal about effective advocacy before the current Supreme Court. The brief's strong emphasis on textual and structural arguments, while de-emphasizing the pro-veteran canon in its opening summary, suggests a new D-level principle: **When evaluating the likely success of an argument, give greater weight to claims grounded in statutory text, structure, and precedent than to those that rely primarily on substantive canons of interpretation (e.g., pro-veteran canon, rule of lenity).** The strategic choice by elite counsel (Sidley Austin) to lead with textualism is strong evidence of what they believe will be most persuasive to the median justice.\n-   **Refined Research Agenda:** My general research agenda has now been transformed into a specific and targeted plan of action. The value of the petitioner's brief is not just in the information it contains, but in how it illuminates the most valuable *next* pieces of information to acquire. My updated agenda is:\n    1.  **Acquire the Counter-Argument:** The highest priority is now to obtain and analyze the Respondent's (United States) brief to understand their defense of the Federal Circuit's reasoning.\n    2.  **Analyze Key Precedents in Context:** I must now analyze the specific cases cited (*Corliss Steam-Engine Co.*, *Hernandez v. Dep\u2019t of Air Force*, *Rudisill v. McDonough*) not in isolation, but through the lens of how each party interprets them. The conflict in their interpretations will likely be the fulcrum of the case.\n    3.  **Nuanced Canon Analysis:** My investigation into the pro-veteran canon has become more sophisticated. The question is no longer simply \"does the Court like this canon?\" but rather \"How does the Court deploy this canon in relation to strong textualist arguments? Is it a first-order principle, a tie-breaker, or merely rhetorical dressing?\" Understanding the 2024 *Rudisill* decision is now a top priority."

The key insight that this \nlegal revolution was based on was that choice of law is a matter of interpreting the \nsubstantive laws in question. Proponents claimed legitimacy for the theory on the \nground s that it was more faithful to legislative preferences than the then -prevailing \nappro aches. But the theory is based on the highly purposive approach to \ninterpreting statutes championed by the Legal Process School, whose methods \ndominated statutory interpretation around the time the theory was developed. Since \nthat time, statutory interpret ation has undergone a revolution of its own. The high \npurposivism of the Legal Process School has been mostly repudiated. Few would \nnow maintain, as Brainerd Currie (the father of governmental interest analysis) did, \nthat courts faced with statutory silenc e on a question should try to imagine how the \nlegislature would have resolved the question.  \nThis Article critically examines governmental interest analysis in light of the \nrevolution that has occurred in the field of statutory interpretation since Currie \nelaborated his approach. We agree that choice of law can be understood as a matter \nof interpr eting forum law with respect to its applicability to multi -state cases. But, \ndrawing from the textualist critique of the high purposivism of the Legal Process \nera, we show that Currie -style governmental interest analysis cannot claim \nlegitimacy as more fai thful to legislative preferences than other possible interpretive \napproaches. Consistent with its general shift away from purposivism in statutory \ninterpretation, the U.S. Supreme Court has updated its approach to federal choice \nof law through the adoption  of a presumption against extraterritoriality.

That approach, \nknown as \u201cgovernmental interest  analysis,\u201d now appears to be facing the music. \nFederal courts have all but abandoned it, and while state courts continue to apply it, \nthey do so haphazardly, its persistence sitting  uncomfortably alongside  their \nembrace of non -purposivist methods of statutory interpretation. To the extent it \nsurvives, governmental interest analysis is a relic of a prior age, adrift in the current \njurisprudential environment. Current efforts by the American Law Institute  (\u201cALI\u201d)  \nto chart the future of choice of law reveal t hat legal commentators are forsaking \ngovernmental interest analysis in practice, even while professing fealty to its \ntheoretical foundations. It is now clear that whatever the merits or demerits of the \ntextualism that has largely replaced it, the broad rep udiation of a certain form of \npurposivism is leading to a fundamental reworking of American choice of law. This \nArticle describes and defends this development in U.S. choice of law.  \nGovernmental interest analysis revolutionized choice of law in the United \nStates, largely displacing the approach that had previously prevailed here and that \nstill prevails in most of the rest of the world.2 The key insight that this legal \nrevolution was based on was that choice of law is a matter of interpreting the \nsubstantive laws in question.3 As explained by Brainerd Currie, the theorist behind \n \n 1.

See Brainerd Currie , Notes on Methods and Objectives in the \nConflict of Laws , 1959 DUKE L.J.  171, 177\u201378 (1959) . \n394 ARIZONA LAW REVIEW  [VOL. 67: 391 \ngovernmental interest analysis, the choice -of-law process \u201cis essentially the familiar \n[process] of construction or interpretation.\u201d4 If the legislature has addressed a law\u2019s \napplicability to cases having foreign elements, the court follows the legislature\u2019s \ndirection. But usually , a legislature enacts laws without addressing their multi -state \napplicability.5 Even in the face of legislative silence on this question, however, the \nquestion for Currie remained one of interpretation: \u201cJust as we determine by [the] \nprocess [of statutory interpretation] how a statute applies in time, and how it applies \nto marginal d omestic situations, so we may determine how it should be applied to \ncases involving foreign elements in order to effectuate the legislative purpose.\u201d6 \nOn closer examination, it turns out that Currie\u2019s true innovation was not to \nregard choice of law as a matter of interpretation, but rather to bring a particular \napproach to interpretation  to bear on the question. The traditional choice -of-law \nrules already operated as substantive canons of interpretation, implicitly limiting the \nmulti -state applicability of forum law  in the absence of a contrary legislative \ninstruction.7 Currie\u2019s approach to interpretation differed. He adopted the approach \nthat prevailed at the time he was writing, leading him to interpret laws  as to their \nmulti -state applicability \u201cin order to effectuate the legislative purpose.\u201d8 Currie \n \n 4. Currie , supra note 3 , at 178.  \n 5. We use the term \u201cmulti -state applicability \u201d to refer to a statute \u2019s applicability \nto cases having out -of-state elements \u2014such as a case that involves some out -of-state conduct \nor an out -of-state party.  We distinguish such cases from cases where all of the conduct took \nplace in the same state and all of the parties are from the state, which we refer to as the purely \ninternal case.  We use the term \u201cstate\u201d to include both states of the United States (New York, \nCalifornia) and states in the international sense (France, India).  \n  The draft Third Restatement  prefers to refer to a law \u2019s multi -state scope or \nreach . See infra  Section V.A; RESTATEMENT (THIRD ) OF CONFLICT OF L. \u00a7 5.01 cmt. B (AM. \nL. INST., Tentative Draft No. 3, 2023) . We avoid those terms to remain agnostic about the \ndraft Third Restatement \u2019s view that the relevant question (in the first step of the analysis it \nproposes) is the substantive scope or reach of the law.  An alternative way to understand the \nquestion is as relating to whether forum courts should apply  a given law to a multi -state case \neven if the law technically reaches the case as a substantive matter.  See Carlos M. V\u00e1zquez, \nNon-Extraterritoriality , 137 HARV. L. REV. 1290, 1347 \u201353 (2024).  This is the way the draft \nThird Restatement  understands the second step of the analysis, and we think the first step can \nbe understood this way as well.  See id. Currie himself appears to have understood the question \nat the first step in this sense.  See id.  at 1320 n.133.  For a discussion of the two ways of \nunderstanding the question, see infra  Section  V.B.  Because we do not take a position on this \nquestion here, we use the more inclusive term \u201cmulti -state applicability. \u201d \n 6. Currie, supra note 3, at 178.  \n 7. See infra  note 37 and accompanying text. Indeed, the idea  that choice of law \nis about statutory interpretation has ancient roots. See Hessell E. Yntema,  The Historic Bases \nof Private International Law , 2 AM. J. COMP AR. L. 297, 303 (1953) (\u201cThe  jurists in the \nmedieval Italian and French universities, who first elaborated conflicts law in  commentaries \non the lex Cunctos populos  (C. 1, 1, 1), and their successors in succeeding  centuries,  \ncommonly assumed that the solution of conflicts of laws was essentially a matter  of statutory \ninterpretation, of classifying statutes as real or personal with respect to  their spheres of \napplication.\u201d).  \n 8. See supra  text accompanying note 6. This idea goes back centuries as well.  \nSee Friedrich K. Juenger, A Page of History , 35 MERCER L. REV. 419, 433 (1984) (quoting \n \n2025] GOVERNMENTAL INTEREST ANALYSIS  395 \nrejected one approach to statutory interpretation, under which a statute that is silent \nregarding multi -state applicability  would be interpreted in the light of traditional \nchoice -of-law rules, and replaced it with the highly purposivist approach to statutory \ninterpretation of the Legal Process School. In his words, a court  engaging in a \nchoice -of-law analysis  should \u201ctr[y] to decide [the question] as it believes [the \nlegislature] would have decided [it] had it foreseen the problem.\u201d9 According to \nCurrie, the purpose behind a given common -law rule or statute would tell us  whether \nthe enacting state had an interest in having the law applied, which would in turn lead \nto a determination about which state\u2019s law should be applied to a given case.10 This \napproach has become known as the \u201cgovernmental interest analysis\u201d approach to \nchoice of law.11 \nSince Currie\u2019s time, however, statutory -interpretation theory  has \nundergone  a revolution  of its own .12 In particular, the Supreme Court has forcefully \nchallenged approaches to statutory interpretation that ask how a legislature \u201cwould \nhave decided\u201d a question under an enacted statute. The Court has disdained the \npurposivism of the Legal Process School and embraced a far more textualist \napproach. This statutory -interpretation revolution has influenced the Court\u2019s \napproach when determining the applicability of federal statutes to cases having \nforeign elements. Expressly disavowing an approach that s eeks to \u201cdivin[e] what \nCongress would have wanted if it had thought of the situation before the court,\u201d13 \nthe Court has adopted a \u201cpresumption against extraterritoriality.\u201d14 Like Currie, the \nSupreme C ourt regard s the issue as one of interpreting the substantive statute in \nquestion, but unlike Currie, it presume s that \u201c[w]hen a statute gives no clear \nindication of an extraterri torial application, it has none.\u201d15 Focusing largely, if not \nexclusively, on the statute\u2019s text, federal courts now interpret federal statutes to \napply only domestically unless Congress has affirmatively addressed the question \nof the statute\u2019s multi -state applicability .16 \n \nGuy de Coquille, who argued in the sixteenth century that the distinction between real and \npersonal laws should not depend \u201con the mere shell of words, but on . . . the presumed and \napparent purpose of those who have enacted the statute or custom.\u201d (quotin g 1 A.

See infra Section IV.A.  \n396 ARIZONA LAW REVIEW  [VOL. 67: 391 \nOf course, in cases not involving federal law, choice of law in the United \nStates is a matter of state law. For their part, the states have largely followed their \nfederal brethren in rejecting high purposivism  in statutory interpretation . In the \nchoice -of-law context, however, a lthough some states have followed the Supreme \nCourt in adopting a presumption against extraterritoriality,17 most states have \nretained elements of Currie\u2019s governmental -interest analysis. In the area of choice \nof law, the purposivism of the Legal Process School endures in weakened form. By \nclinging to the high purposivism of governmental interest analysis in the context of \nchoice of law, some states perpetuate an approach to statutory interpretation that \nthey have increasingly disfavored in other contexts.  \nIn its current project of elaborating a Third Restatement of Conflict of Laws , \nthe ALI has endorsed Currie\u2019s claim that choice of law is a matter of ordinary \ninterpretation.18 At the same time, the draft Third Restatement  specifically disavows \nCurrie\u2019s interpretive approach.19 Indeed, the draft Third Restatement  departs \ndramatically from Currie\u2019s purposivist analysis. Where the legislature has left the \nissue of territorial reach unaddressed, the draft Third Restatement  does not instruct \ncourts to attempt to interpret the laws in question to effectuate the legislature\u2019s \npurposes.20 Instead, it adopts a presumption of extraterritoriality: similar in form, \nthough not in content, to the federal presumption against  extraterritoriality.21 What\u2019s \nmore, the subject -specific rules that the draft Third Restatement  adopts  for the \nresolution of conflicts leave little room for the sort of analysis of state \u201cinterests\u201d \nthat Currie favored.22 If it becomes as widely adopted as the Second Restatement  has \nbeen, the draft Third Restatement \u2019s approach would accelerate the demise of \nCurrie\u2019s purposivist approach to choice of law.  \nThis Article critically examines governmental interest analysis\u2019 s approach \nto statutory interpretation in light of the revolution that has occurred in the field of \nstatutory interpretation since Currie elaborated his approach. Our aims are partly \ndescriptive and partly normative. Descriptively, we show that choice of law has been \nconceived by adherents of both traditionalist and modern approaches as, at bottom, \na matter of statutory interpre tation \u2014a matter of interpreting forum law as to its \nmulti -state app licability. Currie\u2019s innovation was to bring a particular approach to \nstatutory interpretation to bear on the matter: the highly purposive approach of the \nLegal Process School.

We show \nthat the U.S. Supreme Court has drawn on developments in statutory -interpretation \ntheory in departing from overtly purposivist approaches to determining the multi -\nstate applicability of federal statutes. T he states, on the other hand, have lagged in \nbringing these lessons to bear on their choice -of-law methodologies. In the states \nthat still rely on Currie\u2019s insights, governmental interest analysis is frozen in amber, \npersisti ng in an environment that has rejected its core premises. Finally, we show \nthat the draft Third Restatement  is largely consistent with the modern critique of \npurposivism. Its anticipated adoption seems poised to hasten  the demise of Currie -\nstyle interest analysis.  \nNormatively, we draw on the insights of the modern critique of \npurposivism to explain the numerous ways that governmental interest analysis as \ndeveloped by Currie fails to capture any actual legislative preferences as to the \nmulti -state applicability  of laws . We are not the first to point out that interest analysis \ndoes not capture legislative preferences,23 but we contribute to this debate by \nbringing modern statutory -interpretation theory \u2014in particular, the modern critique \nof purposivism \u2014to bear on the question. The relationship between the choice -of-\nlaw revolution and the revolution in statutory interpretation has thus far gone largely \nunaddressed.24 This Article fills that gap by showing how, sub silentio , insights and \ncritiques developed within statutory -interpretation theory  have shaken the \nfoundations of the most influential school of choice of law in the United States.  \nThis development is profoundly important. Multi -state disputes are set to \nmultiply as a deeply interconnected national (and international) economy confronts \na fractured political landscape, provoking confrontations over questions ranging \nfrom animal ethics25 to abortion.26 The methodology that courts use to resolve those \nmulti -state disputes can be outcome determinative \u2014the difference between, for \nexample, whether Nazi -looted art remains in a Spanish museum or is return ed to a \nJewish family in California.27 Or whether the victims of a terrorist attack have a \nviable tort claim against the foreign government that sponsored the group \n \n 23.

It then dives more deeply into the theory of governmental interest \nanalysis as first elaborated by Currie, focusing on the role played by legislative \npurpose in the interpretive enterprise. Part II examines the revolution in federal \nstatutory -interpretation theory  since Currie\u2019s time. This Part discusses the shift from \npurposivism to  textualism, focusing on the critiques of purposivism that underlay \nthe shift. Part III takes a critical look at Currie\u2019s approach to choice of law in light \nof the critiques of purposivism that have led federal courts to disavow a strongly \npurposivist appr oach to statutory interpretation.  \nPart IV explores how federal and state courts have adapted their choice -of-\nlaw approaches since the statutory interpretation revolution, with a particular focus \non presumptions against extraterritoriality. It first looks more closely at the Supreme \nCourt\u2019s  express abandonment of a purposivist approach to determining the multi -\nstate applicability of federal statutes and its adoption of a presumption against \nextraterritoriality in its place. This Part then examines the landscape in the state \ncourts to determi ne the extent to which the states have been following the purposivist \napproach proposed by Currie, focusing on the states that have departed from the \ntraditional approach of the First Restatement . Although the picture is messy, we \nconclude that Currie\u2019s purposivist approach is still alive, in some form, among the \nstates.  \nFinally, Part V examines the approach of the draft Third Restatement  to the \nquestion of a statute\u2019s multi -state applicability. As noted, while the draft Third \nRestatement  generally endorses Currie\u2019s view that choice of law is, at least in part, \na matter of interpreting the multi -state scope of the contending laws, in practice it \nrepresents a significant departure from Currie\u2019s theory. Both in its presumption of \nextraterritoriality and in the operation of its subject -specific choice -of-law rules, the \ndraft Third Restatement  appears destined to accelerate the shift away from Currie -\nstyle governmental interest analysis in the states.  \nI. CHOICE OF LAW AS STATUTORY INTERPRETATION , PRE- AND \nPOST-CURRIE  \nChoice -of-law issues arise when a dispute spans state boundaries. If \neverything occurred in one state and all of the parties are from that state, a court has \nno need to decide a choice -of-law question. The court decides the case according to \nthe law of the  only state having connections to the dispute. (We will call this the \npurely internal case.) A choice -of-law question arises only if the events giving rise \nto the dispute occurred in more than one state, or if the parties (or other interested \npersons) are affiliated with different states. (We will call this the multi -state case.)  \n \n 28. See John F. Coyle, Choice of Law in Terrorism Cases , 101 NOTRE DAME L. \nREV. (forthcoming 2026) (draft on file with authors).  \n2025] GOVERNMENTAL INTEREST ANALYSIS  399 \nIn enacting statutes, legislatures will sometimes address the statute\u2019s multi -\nstate applicability by including what might be called an \u201cexternal scope provision.\u201d29 \nThe legislature might specify that the statute\u2019s substantive provisions apply to \npersons domiciled in the state, or to conduct that occurs in the state. When the \nlegislature has included such a provision in a statute, the question of the statute\u2019s \nmulti -state applicability is straightforwardly one of statutory interpretation \u2014it is a \nmatter of interpreting the external scope provision.30 Such provisions have \nhistorically been included in relatively few statutes, however.31 Even today, most \nstatutes lack such provisions. This Article focuses on how the courts decide the \nquestion of a law\u2019s multi -state applicability with respect to laws that do not include \nan external scope provision.  \nEven statutes that lack an external scope provision might be thought to have \na text relevant to the issue of multi -state applicability . Statutes are often phrased in \nbroad, all -encompassing terms. For example, \u00a7 33 of the Jones Act, addressing \n\u201crecovery for injury to or death of a seaman,\u201d originally extended to \u201cany seaman \nwho shall suffer personal injury in the course of his employment.\u201d32 State statutes, \ntoo, typically extend broadly to \u201cany person.\u201d33 The courts, however, have uniformly \nrefused to read such statutes literally, reasoning that such literalism would produce \nunreasonable results. As explained by Justice Jackson in Lauritzen v. Larsen , if we \nread the Jones Act literally, we would conclude that \u201cCongress has extended our law \nand opened our courts to all alien seafaring men injured anywhere in the world in \nservice of watercraft of every foreign nation \u2014 a hand on a Chinese junk, never \noutside Chinese waters, would not be beyond its literal wording  . . . .\u201d34 In rejecting \na literal interpretation of such statutes, the courts \u2014both state and federal \u2014assume \nthat legislatures typically enact statutes with only the purely internal case in mind \nand d o not give any thought to the applicability of the statute to cases having foreign \nelements.35 Based on that assumption, the courts treat the issue of multi -state \napplicability as open to interpretation. In Justice Robert Jackson\u2019s words, the issue \nfor the courts in the face of such statutes is \u201ca problem of statutory construction \nrather commonplace in a federal system by which courts often have to decide \n \n 29. For an analysis of such provisions, see generally V\u00e1zquez, supra note 5.  \n 30. For example, the courts might have to determine if the provision requires  \napplication of the law to cases within its scope or merely permits  its application to such cases. \nThe draft Third Restatement  presumes that such provisions do not require the law\u2019s \napplication to included cases.

The Supreme Court  of Alabama \u2019s decision in \nAlabama Great Southern Railroad v. Carroll is a good example.38 Alabama had \nenacted a statute repealing the common -law fellow -servant rule, but the legislature \nhad not addressed the statute\u2019s applicability to multi -state cases.39 The injury in the \ncase had occurred in Mississippi, and the Court decided that the traditional lex loci \ndelicti  rule called for application of the law of the place where  the injury occurred.40 \nThe Alabama statute was phrased in all -encompassing language, but the Court \nassumed that the legislature had not focused on the issue of multi -state applicability . \nIt held that the statute should be interpreted to extend only to cases in which the \ninjury occurred in Alabama. In the Court\u2019s words :  \nSection 2590 of the Code  . . . is to be interpreted in the light of \nuniversally recognized principles of private international or interstate \nlaw, as if its operation had been expressly limited to this State and as \nif its first line read as follows: \u201cWhen a personal injury is received in \nAlabama by a servant or employee, \u201d etc.41 \nIn this way, the state\u2019s general choice -of-law rule ( lex loci delicti ) implicitly \ncircumscribe d the general language of the statute. The legislature was presumed to \nhave instructed the Court to apply the substantive rule only to the extent it would be \napplicable under traditional choice -of-law rules. Traditional choice -of-law rules, in \nother words, functioned as a strong -form substantive canon of interpretation.42 \nThese traditional rules continued to prevail in the states until the mid -\ntwentieth century. Their defenders claimed (unconvincingly) that these rules were \ninherent in the nature of state sovereignty.43 Some courts understood them to be part \nof the general common law.44 The rules sometimes produced harsh and seemingly \n \n 36.

But this approach promised a measure of uniformity (meaning the \nresult would be the same regardless of where suit was brought), as well as certainty \nand predictability.  \nThe traditional approach was subjected to intense criticism beginning in \nthe 1930s, largely by legal realist scholars.45 These scholars criticized the harsh and \narbitrary results the traditional approach produced, and they debunked the notion \nthat these results were required by notions of state sovereignty.46 The Erie Railroad \nCo. v. Tompkins  decision and its progeny established that absent a federal rule , \nchoice of law was a matter of the positive law of each state.47 The state courts came \nto understand that how they approached choice of law was largely up to them, and \nmany decided to reject the traditional approach.  \nThe first fully formed alternative to the traditional approach was put \nforward in the scholarship of Brainerd Currie in the 1950s and early 1960s. His key \ninsight was that the answer to the choice -of-law question should be found in the \nsubstantive laws vyi ng for application. If the question was one of interpretation, as \neven traditionalist courts appeared to recognize, the answer should be found through \napplication of the ordinary methods of statutory interpretation.48 At the time Currie \nwas writing, the prevailing approach to statutory interpretation was the highly \npurposivist approach of the Legal Process School .49 Accordingly, Currie argued that \nin interpreting laws as to their multi -state applicability, the courts should apply an \napproach that interprets statutes \u201cin order to effectuate the legislative purpose.\u201d50 \nGiven the assumptions that courts make in their posing of the question, \nhowever, the task Currie had in mind was easier said than done. Recall that most \nstatutes do not include a provision addressing the law\u2019s multi -state applicability . As \nwe have seen, the relevant laws are typically written in all -encompassing terms \u2014\ne.g., \u201cevery person .\u201d The courts decline to read the laws literally on the assumption \nthat the legislature enacted the law with the purely internal case in mind and \nneglected entirely the question of the statute\u2019s multi -state applicability. The \n\u201clegislative purpose\u201d to which Currie referred could not have been the legislature\u2019s \npurpose with respect to the statute\u2019s multi -state applicability, as by hypothesis there \nwas no intent on that specific question.

The courts\u2019 task under Currie\u2019s framework was, \nthus, to interpret the statute on an issue that the legislature did not give any thought  \nto, much less memorialize in statutory text.  \nIn an early article,51 Currie illustrated his approach by examining a classic \nchoice -of-law decision from the 1890s, Milliken v.

The Court \naccordingly held that the contract was not enforceable.56 \nCurrie argued that the Court should have framed the issue as whether the \nMassachusetts law invalidating such contracts, properly interpreted, was applicable \nto the contracts of married women from Maine.57 But the statute was silent on this \nquestion.

On Monday, April 29, the Supreme Court of the United States agreed to hear a case this fall with the potential to significantly broaden U.S. veterans\u2019 opportunities to receive VA benefits.[1] The case, Bufkin v. McDonough, centers on two veterans\u2014Joshua Bufkin and Norman Thornton\u2014who were denied medical benefits by the Department of Veterans Affairs and Board of Veterans Appeals (\u201cBVA\u201d).[2] Bufkin and Thornton each sought VA benefits for PTSD in connection with their military service, but were denied after the VA decided that examinations by VA psychologists outweighed the veterans\u2019 prior examinations and diagnoses.[3] These rulings were reviewed and affirmed by the U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (the \u201cVeterans Court\u201d), which found merely that the BVA didn\u2019t make any clear mistakes about the facts of the petitioners\u2019 cases.[4] Bufkin and Thornton appealed the Veterans Court decisions, arguing that these denials violated a principle called the \u201cbenefit-of-the-doubt\u201d rule.[5] They lost their cases at the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals, but now that the Supreme Court has accepted their petition for review, they have a new shot at changing the way that the VA thinks about veterans\u2019 benefits.[6] The Benefit-of-the-Doubt Rule Boiled down to basics, Bufkin v. McDonough is about the application of the benefit-of-the-doubt rule to appeals of BVA decisions. The benefit-of-the-doubt rule is a well-established policy in veterans\u2019 law: when the evidence in favor of and against a veteran\u2019s benefits claim is approximately balanced, the VA department should rule in favor of the veteran\u2019s claim.[7]\u00a0 In 1988, Congress codified the benefit-of-the-doubt rule into law as 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 5107(b): (b) Benefit of the doubt. The Secretary [of Veteran\u2019s Affairs] shall consider all information and lay and medical evidence of record in a case before the Secretary with respect to benefits under laws administered by the Secretary. When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, the secretary shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant.[8] This mandate applies to disability and benefits determinations by the VA office and BVA, and is further established within the Department of Veterans Affairs\u2019 own regulations\u2014when there is a reasonable doubt about some aspect of a VA disability claim, and the evidence is about the same weight on either side, that doubt should be resolved in favor of the claimant.[9] In 2002, Congress passed the Veterans\u2019 Benefits Act (\u201cVBA\u201d), modifying the Veterans Court\u2019s power to review BVA decisions.[10] The language in one part of the VBA, 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7261, forms the basis of Bufkin\u2019s issue in controversy.[11] Section 7261(a) requires the Veterans Court (when reviewing BVA decisions) to decide legal questions; compel unlawfully-withheld action by the Secretary of Veterans\u2019 Affairs; set aside BVA decisions that are arbitrary, capricious, unconstitutional, unlawful, or lacking in due procedure; and reverse findings of fact that are \u201cclearly erroneous.\u201d[12] Section 7261(b) states that when the Veterans Court makes a determination on an appeal from the BVA, \u201cthe Court shall review the record of proceedings before the Secretary and the Board of Veterans\u2019 Appeals . . . and shall take due account of the Secretary\u2019s application of [the benefit-of-the-doubt rule].\u201d[13] Bufkin and Thornton argued that under the VBA\u2019s Section 7261(b), the Veterans Court must conduct a much more generous review of closely-balanced issues than it did before.[14] If Congress\u2019s passage of the VBA is to mean anything at all, they claim, then it must require deeper attention to benefit-of-the-doubt on appeal.[15] Bufkin\u2019s Federal Circuit holding and arguments before the Supreme Court In August 2023, the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals ruled on Bufkin and Thornton\u2019s cases and rejected their more generous interpretation of Section 7261.[16] The Federal Circuit held that under Section 7261(b), the Veterans Court is only required to examine BVA findings and applications of the benefit-of-the-doubt rule for clear error\u2014the same scope and standard of review permitted by Section 7261(a).[17] Clear error is a difficult standard to meet in a lawsuit. Under this ruling, the Veterans Court has no obligation to separately review whether or not a veteran actually received the benefit of the doubt on close material issues of a case; only whether or not the BVA made an obvious factual mistake when applying it.[18] Bufkin and Thornton\u2019s petition to the Supreme Court argues that Section 7261(b) requires the Veterans Court to conduct a separate analysis of whether or not a veteran received the benefit of the doubt on close disputed issues before the VA Department and BVA\u2014regardless of whether the BVA made \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d factual findings under 7261(a), and regardless of whether or not a veteran claimant accused the BVA of factual error or inappropriate application of the benefit-of-the-doubt rule on appeal.[19] The reading of Section 7261 proposed by Bufkin and Thornton is much broader than the Federal Circuit\u2019s rule. If the Supreme Court affirms the Federal Circuit, the old rule will remain in place\u2014but if the Supreme Court chooses to agree with the petitioners, it could open up a whole new world for veterans across the country to challenge past disability determinations where the VA failed to give enough deference to their needs. Permitting broader review by courts appealing VA decisions may allow veterans with close cases to successfully receive needed benefits, where previously the Veterans Court might not have given their cases a deeper look. The current Supreme Court justices have proven themselves sympathetic to veterans\u2019 needs in another recent decision, Rudisill v. McDonough, where a 7-2 majority voted to broaden access to overlapping GI Bill benefits[20]\u2014so keep an eye on Bufkin during the 2024-25 term.

Justices consider whether equitable tolling is available to veterans. By\t\t\t\t\t\t\tYelena Duterte on Oct 6, 2022 In Tuesday\u2019s oral argument, the Supreme Court grappled with three main issues in Arellano v. McDonough, a case about retroactive disability benefits for veterans who failed to apply for those benefits within the one-year window prescribed by a federal statute. First, the court looked into whether 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 5110(b)(1) is a statute of limitations to determine whether the Irwin presumption, which allows for equitable tolling, applies. Second, if it is a statute of limitations, the court pondered whether Congress rebutted the presumption that equitable tolling is available to veterans. Finally, the court focused on the practicality of the Department of Veterans Affairs applying equitable tolling. For background, in 1981, Adolfo Arellano was discharged from the military with a severe mental health condition. Arellano did not file for benefits until 2011, 30 years after service, because his disability left him unable to understand that he was eligible to file a claim for benefits. The VA awarded him disability benefits, but only going back to the date he filed. Arellano is asking the court to allow him a chance to argue for retroactive benefits back to 1981, through the doctrine of equitable tolling. To determine if equitable tolling can apply, the court first must determine whether Section 5110(b)(1) is a statute of limitations. When considering this, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson framed her understanding of statutes of limitation as a \u201cfunneling effect.\u201d She described typical statutes of limitation as preventing a party from pursuing a claim or lawsuit and funneling out certain people if they waited too long to file. Here, Jackson styled Section 5110 and its exceptions as more of a pyramid. The general rule, under subsection (a), provides that the date the application is filed is the start date of payments. Subsection (b), however, creates an exception, allowing for more benefits, up to a year more, and thus producing a pyramid effect rather than a funnel. James Barney, arguing on behalf of Arellano, explained that the court should focus on the exception to the rule and whether the exception can be equitably tolled, rather than how it interfaces with the general rule. Justice Elena Kagan asked the government\u2019s lawyer, Assistant to the Solicitor General Sopan Joshi, whether statutes need to have specific or magic language or whether a statute of limitation can be functional without special words, as discussed in Lozano v. Alvarez. Joshi argued that this statute does not \u201cwalk or quack\u201d like a statute of limitations and it doesn\u2019t function as one either. Thus, the presumption should not apply. Although the government does not concede that this is a statute of limitation, it believes the statutory language rebuts the Irwin presumption. Justice Sonia Sotomayor questioned whether the language in Section 5110(a) rebuts the presumption where it states, \u201cUnless specifically provided otherwise in this chapter, the effective date \u2026 shall not be earlier than the date of receipt of application.\u201d Barney argued that the court, in United States v. Kwai Fun Wong, found words of emphasis like these are not definitive on this question of rebuttal. He went on to identify that this exception is the only exception that impacts VA disability compensation. He insisted that the court look narrowly at whether Congress has spoken on this exception to rebut the presumption. Chief Justice John Roberts questioned the government on the context here, pointing out that this is an agency to support disabled veterans and not an agency with rigid rules, like the IRS. Although the chief sidestepped the issue of the veteran\u2019s canon, he seemed interested in whether statutes for this agency should have a different standard than others. The chief justice also pointed out that the statute\u2019s 16 exceptions may cut against the government. Specifically, Congress has waived its sovereign immunity, has allowed many exceptions to the rule already, and has not explicitly barred equitable tolling in the statute itself. Joshi asked the court to look at the statute as a whole and argued that, if Congress wanted equitable tolling, it would have explicitly provided for that exception. Finally, the court asks several questions about the practicality of an agency applying equitable tolling. Jackson questioned Barney about whether an agency can handle this type of question, as equitable tolling is usually a matter reserved for the judiciary. Barney explained that the agency already looks at equitable tolling when appeals are late and whether good cause applies. Justice Samuel Alito inquired whether the analysis would be any different for veterans like the Edgewood veterans who were prevented from disclosing classified information. Joshi provided a couple of ways a veteran could apply, conceding that these will likely not fully resolve the issue. He asserted that Congress could pass legislation to allow veterans like the Edgewood veterans to obtain additional benefits. Beyond the context of veterans\u2019 benefits, the court\u2019s eventual decision may flesh out a definition of a statute of limitations and clarify how explicit Congress must be to rebut the Irwin presumption.

Bogue** \nGovernmental interest analysis revolutionized choice of law in the United States and \nheavily influenced the Second Restatement of the Conflict of Laws , the most widely \nfollowed method of resolving conflicts among the 50 states. The key insight that this \nlegal revolution was based on was that choice of law is a matter of interpreting the \nsubstantive laws in question. Proponents claimed legitimacy for the theory on the \nground s that it was more faithful to legislative preferences than the then -prevailing \nappro aches. But the theory is based on the highly purposive approach to \ninterpreting statutes championed by the Legal Process School, whose methods \ndominated statutory interpretation around the time the theory was developed. Since \nthat time, statutory interpret ation has undergone a revolution of its own. The high \npurposivism of the Legal Process School has been mostly repudiated. Few would \nnow maintain, as Brainerd Currie (the father of governmental interest analysis) did, \nthat courts faced with statutory silenc e on a question should try to imagine how the \nlegislature would have resolved the question.  \nThis Article critically examines governmental interest analysis in light of the \nrevolution that has occurred in the field of statutory interpretation since Currie \nelaborated his approach. We agree that choice of law can be understood as a matter \nof interpr eting forum law with respect to its applicability to multi -state cases. But, \ndrawing from the textualist critique of the high purposivism of the Legal Process \nera, we show that Currie -style governmental interest analysis cannot claim \nlegitimacy as more fai thful to legislative preferences than other possible interpretive \napproaches. Consistent with its general shift away from purposivism in statutory \ninterpretation, the U.S. Supreme Court has updated its approach to federal choice \nof law through the adoption  of a presumption against extraterritoriality. The states, \non the other hand, have lagged in bringing these lessons to bear on their choice -of-\n \n *  Scott K.

In \nthe states that continue to follow Currie, governmental interest analysis is frozen in \namber, persisting in an environment that has rejected its core premises.  \nThe American Law Institute\u2019s current project of elaborating a Third Restatement of \nthe Conflict of Laws  may accelerate the end of Currie -style governmental interest \nanalysis. The draft Third Restatement  endorses Currie\u2019s claim that choice of law is \na matter of statutory interpretation (at least in part). At the same time, however, it \ndramatically revises Currie\u2019s legacy by mostly rejecting his purposivist approach \nto interpretation. The draft Third Restatement \u2019s disavowal of an overtly purposivist \napproach is broadly consistent with the modern critique of purposivism. If  the draft \nThird Restatement  becomes  as widely adopted as the Second Restatement  was, it \nwould hasten  the demise of Currie -style interest analysis.  \nTABLE OF CONTENTS  \nINTRODUCTION  ................................ ................................ ................................ ......393 \nI.

That approach, \nknown as \u201cgovernmental interest  analysis,\u201d now appears to be facing the music. \nFederal courts have all but abandoned it, and while state courts continue to apply it, \nthey do so haphazardly, its persistence sitting  uncomfortably alongside  their \nembrace of non -purposivist methods of statutory interpretation. To the extent it \nsurvives, governmental interest analysis is a relic of a prior age, adrift in the current \njurisprudential environment. Current efforts by the American Law Institute  (\u201cALI\u201d)  \nto chart the future of choice of law reveal t hat legal commentators are forsaking \ngovernmental interest analysis in practice, even while professing fealty to its \ntheoretical foundations. It is now clear that whatever the merits or demerits of the \ntextualism that has largely replaced it, the broad rep udiation of a certain form of \npurposivism is leading to a fundamental reworking of American choice of law. This \nArticle describes and defends this development in U.S. choice of law.  \nGovernmental interest analysis revolutionized choice of law in the United \nStates, largely displacing the approach that had previously prevailed here and that \nstill prevails in most of the rest of the world.2 The key insight that this legal \nrevolution was based on was that choice of law is a matter of interpreting the \nsubstantive laws in question.3 As explained by Brainerd Currie, the theorist behind \n \n 1.

But usually , a legislature enacts laws without addressing their multi -state \napplicability.5 Even in the face of legislative silence on this question, however, the \nquestion for Currie remained one of interpretation: \u201cJust as we determine by [the] \nprocess [of statutory interpretation] how a statute applies in time, and how it applies \nto marginal d omestic situations, so we may determine how it should be applied to \ncases involving foreign elements in order to effectuate the legislative purpose.\u201d6 \nOn closer examination, it turns out that Currie\u2019s true innovation was not to \nregard choice of law as a matter of interpretation, but rather to bring a particular \napproach to interpretation  to bear on the question. The traditional choice -of-law \nrules already operated as substantive canons of interpretation, implicitly limiting the \nmulti -state applicability of forum law  in the absence of a contrary legislative \ninstruction.7 Currie\u2019s approach to interpretation differed.

We distinguish such cases from cases where all of the conduct took \nplace in the same state and all of the parties are from the state, which we refer to as the purely \ninternal case.  We use the term \u201cstate\u201d to include both states of the United States (New York, \nCalifornia) and states in the international sense (France, India).  \n  The draft Third Restatement  prefers to refer to a law \u2019s multi -state scope or \nreach . See infra  Section V.A; RESTATEMENT (THIRD ) OF CONFLICT OF L. \u00a7 5.01 cmt. B (AM. \nL. INST., Tentative Draft No. 3, 2023) . We avoid those terms to remain agnostic about the \ndraft Third Restatement \u2019s view that the relevant question (in the first step of the analysis it \nproposes) is the substantive scope or reach of the law.  An alternative way to understand the \nquestion is as relating to whether forum courts should apply  a given law to a multi -state case \neven if the law technically reaches the case as a substantive matter.  See Carlos M. V\u00e1zquez, \nNon-Extraterritoriality , 137 HARV. L. REV. 1290, 1347 \u201353 (2024).  This is the way the draft \nThird Restatement  understands the second step of the analysis, and we think the first step can \nbe understood this way as well.  See id. Currie himself appears to have understood the question \nat the first step in this sense.  See id.  at 1320 n.133.  For a discussion of the two ways of \nunderstanding the question, see infra  Section  V.B.

The Court has disdained the \npurposivism of the Legal Process School and embraced a far more textualist \napproach.

For their part, the states have largely followed their \nfederal brethren in rejecting high purposivism  in statutory interpretation . In the \nchoice -of-law context, however, a lthough some states have followed the Supreme \nCourt in adopting a presumption against extraterritoriality,17 most states have \nretained elements of Currie\u2019s governmental -interest analysis. In the area of choice \nof law, the purposivism of the Legal Process School endures in weakened form. By \nclinging to the high purposivism of governmental interest analysis in the context of \nchoice of law, some states perpetuate an approach to statutory interpretation that \nthey have increasingly disfavored in other contexts.  \nIn its current project of elaborating a Third Restatement of Conflict of Laws , \nthe ALI has endorsed Currie\u2019s claim that choice of law is a matter of ordinary \ninterpretation.18 At the same time, the draft Third Restatement  specifically disavows \nCurrie\u2019s interpretive approach.19 Indeed, the draft Third Restatement  departs \ndramatically from Currie\u2019s purposivist analysis. Where the legislature has left the \nissue of territorial reach unaddressed, the draft Third Restatement  does not instruct \ncourts to attempt to interpret the laws in question to effectuate the legislature\u2019s \npurposes.20 Instead, it adopts a presumption of extraterritoriality: similar in form, \nthough not in content, to the federal presumption against  extraterritoriality.21 What\u2019s \nmore, the subject -specific rules that the draft Third Restatement  adopts  for the \nresolution of conflicts leave little room for the sort of analysis of state \u201cinterests\u201d \nthat Currie favored.22 If it becomes as widely adopted as the Second Restatement  has \nbeen, the draft Third Restatement \u2019s approach would accelerate the demise of \nCurrie\u2019s purposivist approach to choice of law.  \nThis Article critically examines governmental interest analysis\u2019 s approach \nto statutory interpretation in light of the revolution that has occurred in the field of \nstatutory interpretation since Currie elaborated his approach. Our aims are partly \ndescriptive and partly normative. Descriptively, we show that choice of law has been \nconceived by adherents of both traditionalist and modern approaches as, at bottom, \na matter of statutory interpre tation \u2014a matter of interpreting forum law as to its \nmulti -state app licability.

T he states, on the other hand, have lagged in \nbringing these lessons to bear on their choice -of-law methodologies. In the states \nthat still rely on Currie\u2019s insights, governmental interest analysis is frozen in amber, \npersisti ng in an environment that has rejected its core premises. Finally, we show \nthat the draft Third Restatement  is largely consistent with the modern critique of \npurposivism. Its anticipated adoption seems poised to hasten  the demise of Currie -\nstyle interest analysis.  \nNormatively, we draw on the insights of the modern critique of \npurposivism to explain the numerous ways that governmental interest analysis as \ndeveloped by Currie fails to capture any actual legislative preferences as to the \nmulti -state applicability  of laws .

It then dives more deeply into the theory of governmental interest \nanalysis as first elaborated by Currie, focusing on the role played by legislative \npurpose in the interpretive enterprise. Part II examines the revolution in federal \nstatutory -interpretation theory  since Currie\u2019s time. This Part discusses the shift from \npurposivism to  textualism, focusing on the critiques of purposivism that underlay \nthe shift. Part III takes a critical look at Currie\u2019s approach to choice of law in light \nof the critiques of purposivism that have led federal courts to disavow a strongly \npurposivist appr oach to statutory interpretation.  \nPart IV explores how federal and state courts have adapted their choice -of-\nlaw approaches since the statutory interpretation revolution, with a particular focus \non presumptions against extraterritoriality. It first looks more closely at the Supreme \nCourt\u2019s  express abandonment of a purposivist approach to determining the multi -\nstate applicability of federal statutes and its adoption of a presumption against \nextraterritoriality in its place. This Part then examines the landscape in the state \ncourts to determi ne the extent to which the states have been following the purposivist \napproach proposed by Currie, focusing on the states that have departed from the \ntraditional approach of the First Restatement . Although the picture is messy, we \nconclude that Currie\u2019s purposivist approach is still alive, in some form, among the \nstates.  \nFinally, Part V examines the approach of the draft Third Restatement  to the \nquestion of a statute\u2019s multi -state applicability. As noted, while the draft Third \nRestatement  generally endorses Currie\u2019s view that choice of law is, at least in part, \na matter of interpreting the multi -state scope of the contending laws, in practice it \nrepresents a significant departure from Currie\u2019s theory. Both in its presumption of \nextraterritoriality and in the operation of its subject -specific choice -of-law rules, the \ndraft Third Restatement  appears destined to accelerate the shift away from Currie -\nstyle governmental interest analysis in the states.  \nI. CHOICE OF LAW AS STATUTORY INTERPRETATION , PRE- AND \nPOST-CURRIE  \nChoice -of-law issues arise when a dispute spans state boundaries. If \neverything occurred in one state and all of the parties are from that state, a court has \nno need to decide a choice -of-law question. The court decides the case according to \nthe law of the  only state having connections to the dispute. (We will call this the \npurely internal case.) A choice -of-law question arises only if the events giving rise \nto the dispute occurred in more than one state, or if the parties (or other interested \npersons) are affiliated with different states. (We will call this the multi -state case.)  \n \n 28. See John F. Coyle, Choice of Law in Terrorism Cases , 101 NOTRE DAME L. \nREV. (forthcoming 2026) (draft on file with authors).  \n2025] GOVERNMENTAL INTEREST ANALYSIS  399 \nIn enacting statutes, legislatures will sometimes address the statute\u2019s multi -\nstate applicability by including what might be called an \u201cexternal scope provision.\u201d29 \nThe legislature might specify that the statute\u2019s substantive provisions apply to \npersons domiciled in the state, or to conduct that occurs in the state. When the \nlegislature has included such a provision in a statute, the question of the statute\u2019s \nmulti -state applicability is straightforwardly one of statutory interpretation \u2014it is a \nmatter of interpreting the external scope provision.30 Such provisions have \nhistorically been included in relatively few statutes, however.31 Even today, most \nstatutes lack such provisions. This Article focuses on how the courts decide the \nquestion of a law\u2019s multi -state applicability with respect to laws that do not include \nan external scope provision.  \nEven statutes that lack an external scope provision might be thought to have \na text relevant to the issue of multi -state applicability . Statutes are often phrased in \nbroad, all -encompassing terms. For example, \u00a7 33 of the Jones Act, addressing \n\u201crecovery for injury to or death of a seaman,\u201d originally extended to \u201cany seaman \nwho shall suffer personal injury in the course of his employment.\u201d32 State statutes, \ntoo, typically extend broadly to \u201cany person.\u201d33 The courts, however, have uniformly \nrefused to read such statutes literally, reasoning that such literalism would produce \nunreasonable results. As explained by Justice Jackson in Lauritzen v. Larsen , if we \nread the Jones Act literally, we would conclude that \u201cCongress has extended our law \nand opened our courts to all alien seafaring men injured anywhere in the world in \nservice of watercraft of every foreign nation \u2014 a hand on a Chinese junk, never \noutside Chinese waters, would not be beyond its literal wording  . . . .\u201d34 In rejecting \na literal interpretation of such statutes, the courts \u2014both state and federal \u2014assume \nthat legislatures typically enact statutes with only the purely internal case in mind \nand d o not give any thought to the applicability of the statute to cases having foreign \nelements.35 Based on that assumption, the courts treat the issue of multi -state \napplicability as open to interpretation. In Justice Robert Jackson\u2019s words, the issue \nfor the courts in the face of such statutes is \u201ca problem of statutory construction \nrather commonplace in a federal system by which courts often have to decide \n \n 29. For an analysis of such provisions, see generally V\u00e1zquez, supra note 5.  \n 30. For example, the courts might have to determine if the provision requires  \napplication of the law to cases within its scope or merely permits  its application to such cases. \nThe draft Third Restatement  presumes that such provisions do not require the law\u2019s \napplication to included cases.

The Supreme Court  of Alabama \u2019s decision in \nAlabama Great Southern Railroad v. Carroll is a good example.38 Alabama had \nenacted a statute repealing the common -law fellow -servant rule, but the legislature \nhad not addressed the statute\u2019s applicability to multi -state cases.39 The injury in the \ncase had occurred in Mississippi, and the Court decided that the traditional lex loci \ndelicti  rule called for application of the law of the place where  the injury occurred.40 \nThe Alabama statute was phrased in all -encompassing language, but the Court \nassumed that the legislature had not focused on the issue of multi -state applicability . \nIt held that the statute should be interpreted to extend only to cases in which the \ninjury occurred in Alabama. In the Court\u2019s words :  \nSection 2590 of the Code  . . . is to be interpreted in the light of \nuniversally recognized principles of private international or interstate \nlaw, as if its operation had been expressly limited to this State and as \nif its first line read as follows: \u201cWhen a personal injury is received in \nAlabama by a servant or employee, \u201d etc.41 \nIn this way, the state\u2019s general choice -of-law rule ( lex loci delicti ) implicitly \ncircumscribe d the general language of the statute. The legislature was presumed to \nhave instructed the Court to apply the substantive rule only to the extent it would be \napplicable under traditional choice -of-law rules. Traditional choice -of-law rules, in \nother words, functioned as a strong -form substantive canon of interpretation.42 \nThese traditional rules continued to prevail in the states until the mid -\ntwentieth century. Their defenders claimed (unconvincingly) that these rules were \ninherent in the nature of state sovereignty.43 Some courts understood them to be part \nof the general common law.44 The rules sometimes produced harsh and seemingly \n \n 36.

But this approach promised a measure of uniformity (meaning the \nresult would be the same regardless of where suit was brought), as well as certainty \nand predictability.  \nThe traditional approach was subjected to intense criticism beginning in \nthe 1930s, largely by legal realist scholars.45 These scholars criticized the harsh and \narbitrary results the traditional approach produced, and they debunked the notion \nthat these results were required by notions of state sovereignty.46 The Erie Railroad \nCo. v. Tompkins  decision and its progeny established that absent a federal rule , \nchoice of law was a matter of the positive law of each state.47 The state courts came \nto understand that how they approached choice of law was largely up to them, and \nmany decided to reject the traditional approach.  \nThe first fully formed alternative to the traditional approach was put \nforward in the scholarship of Brainerd Currie in the 1950s and early 1960s. His key \ninsight was that the answer to the choice -of-law question should be found in the \nsubstantive laws vyi ng for application. If the question was one of interpretation, as \neven traditionalist courts appeared to recognize, the answer should be found through \napplication of the ordinary methods of statutory interpretation.48 At the time Currie \nwas writing, the prevailing approach to statutory interpretation was the highly \npurposivist approach of the Legal Process School .49 Accordingly, Currie argued that \nin interpreting laws as to their multi -state applicability, the courts should apply an \napproach that interprets statutes \u201cin order to effectuate the legislative purpose.\u201d50 \nGiven the assumptions that courts make in their posing of the question, \nhowever, the task Currie had in mind was easier said than done. Recall that most \nstatutes do not include a provision addressing the law\u2019s multi -state applicability . As \nwe have seen, the relevant laws are typically written in all -encompassing terms \u2014\ne.g., \u201cevery person .\u201d The courts decline to read the laws literally on the assumption \nthat the legislature enacted the law with the purely internal case in mind and \nneglected entirely the question of the statute\u2019s multi -state applicability. The \n\u201clegislative purpose\u201d to which Currie referred could not have been the legislature\u2019s \npurpose with respect to the statute\u2019s multi -state applicability, as by hypothesis there \nwas no intent on that specific question.

The courts\u2019 task under Currie\u2019s framework was, \nthus, to interpret the statute on an issue that the legislature did not give any thought  \nto, much less memorialize in statutory text.  \nIn an early article,51 Currie illustrated his approach by examining a classic \nchoice -of-law decision from the 1890s, Milliken v. Pratt .52 Pratt was a married \nwoman from Maine who entered into a contract with Milliken, who was from \nMassachusetts.53 Under Massachusetts law, the contracts of married women were \nnot enforceable.54 Under Maine law, however, such contracts were enforceable.55 \nUnder the traditional approach to choice of law, the governing law was that of the \nplace where the contract was made, which in this case was Massachusetts. The Court \naccordingly held that the contract was not enforceable.56 \nCurrie argued that the Court should have framed the issue as whether the \nMassachusetts law invalidating such contracts, properly interpreted, was applicable \nto the contracts of married women from Maine.57 But the statute was silent on this \nquestion. The traditional approach assumed that the Massachusetts law reached all \ncontracts entered into in Massachusetts and no contracts entered into outside of \nMassachusetts.58 Currie argued that, as a reflection of the legislature\u2019s likely \npreferences, this construction of the statute was not defensible : the Massachusetts \nlegislature is unlikely to have wanted the multi -state applicability of the law it \nenacted to turn on the fortuity of where the contract was made.59 \nCurrie proposed an alternative way to interpret the Massachusetts law on \nthe question of its territorial applicability. At the time Currie was writing, the \ndominant approach to statutory interpretation counseled that a statute should be \ninterpreted to adva nce its purposes.60 Thus, Currie began by identifying the purpose \nof the Massachusetts statute. He concluded that the statute reflected the \nMassachusetts legislature\u2019s view that married women were a category needing \nspecial protection.61 Currie went on to ask: \u201c [Which ] married women [was it \nMassachusetts\u2019 s policy to protect]?\u201d His answer was: \u201cWhy, those with whose \nwelfare Massachusetts is concerned, of course \u2014i.e., Massachusetts married \nwomen.\u201d62 For this reason, he concluded, the statute, properly construed, extends to \nthe contracts of married women from Massachusetts , regardless of where the \n \n 51.

The Court in Milliken should therefore have held that the statute \nshould not be applied to invalidate the contracts of a married woman from Maine. \nIn other words, the statute should have been construed to reach the contracts of \nmarried women from Massachusetts entered into in M aine but not the contracts of \nmarried women from Maine entered into in Massachusetts.63 \nInterest analysis instructs courts first to interpret the laws contending for \napplication based on their purpose.64 This analysis might reveal that only one state\u2019s \nlaw, properly construed, applies to the case. In Milliken , for example, the \nMassachusetts law, properly construed, did not apply because the purpose of its law \nwas to protect Massachusetts married women, and the married woman in the case \nwas from Maine.65 If a similar analysis revealed that Maine law did apply to the case \nbecause its purposes would be advanced, the court should apply Maine law to the \ncase. This type of case is what has become known as a \u201cfalse conflict,\u201d66 and false \nconflicts are easy cases under Currie\u2019s analysis. Currie\u2019s identification of false \nconflicts was widely regarded as a breakthrough in choice -of-law theory.  \nIf both states\u2019 laws extend to the case, and the laws differ, the case presents \na \u201ctrue conflict.\u201d True conflicts are hard cases. Currie originally proposed that the \ncourt always apply forum law to resolve  true conflicts.67 Other scholars have \nproposed alternative approaches. We examine below some of the various approaches \nto resolving true conflicts. For present purposes, it suffices to note that according to \ngovernmental interest analysis, the threshold question in any cho ice-of-law \ninquiry \u2014and, for some theorists, the entire question \u2014is to determine the multi -state \napplicability of the laws contending for application. This question, according to \ngovernmental interest analysis, is an ordinary question of statutory interpret ation, \nand it is to be answered by identifying the law\u2019s purpose and asking whether that \npurpose would be advanced by applying it to the particular multi -state case before \nthe court.  \nBeginning in the early 1960s, many U.S. states rejected the traditional \napproach to choice of law and embraced versions of governmental interest analysis. \nAlthough a significant minority of U.S. states (about one -fifth of them) continue to \nadhere to the tr aditional approach, the rest apply one or more of the \u201cmodern\u201d \napproaches to choice of law,68 most of which find their roots in Currie\u2019s initial \n \n 63.

In Part III, we will look more closely at these and other aspects of Currie\u2019s \ntheory and evaluate Currie\u2019s approach, and those of his acolytes, in light of the \ncritiques that courts and scholars have since directed to the Legal Process approach \nto statutory interpretation. Before assessing the choice -of-law revolution \ninaugurated by Currie, however, we will examine the revolution that has taken place \nin the field of statutory interpretation since Currie\u2019s time.  \nII. THE EVOLUTION OF STATUTORY INTERPRETATION IN FEDERAL \nAND STATE COURTS  \nThe history of statutory interpretation in the United States is in many ways \na story of the fall of a certain type of purposivism. For several decades, the U.S. \nSupreme Court considered its primary mission in statutory interpretation to be \nuncovering the p urposes of the legislature, and the enacted statutory text was just \none of many aids to a statute\u2019s meaning. However, the textualist revolution that \nbegan in the 1980s \u2014which drew on critiques first made by the legal realists \u2014\nsubjected the assumptions upon which this type of purposivism rested to \nincreasingly strident critique. As a result, state and federal courts have mostly \nabandoned the notion that the specific will of a legislature can be ascertained in the \nabsence of clear statutory text.  \nThis Part briefly surveys the decline of old -school purposivism, setting the \nstage for our examination in Part III of how Currie -style interest analysis clings to \nan increasingly outdated method of interpreting statutes. It also demonstrates how \nthis histo ry has played out in state courts. The picture that emerges is one of \nasymmetry: even as state courts have mostly followed their federal brethren in \nrejecting purposivist methods of statutory interpretation, Part IV will show that those \nthat have imbibed C urrie\u2019s methods continue to apply his anachronistic interpretive \nmethods in the choice -of-law context.  \nA. Legislative Intent, Plain Meaning, and Purposive Statutory Interpretation in \nFederal Courts  \nStatutory interpretation has long wrestled with the question of legislative \nintent.69 Though debates continue,70 most have accepted the proposition that judges \nor others tasked with the interpretation of statutes ought to do so in order to best \neffectuate the will of the lawmakers.71 But to state that consensus is immediately to \nrefute it. What it means to \u201ceffectuate\u201d the \u201cwill\u201d of lawmakers , and which  \nlawmakers\u2019 wills matter, have been problems bedeviling statutory interpretation \nfrom the very beginning.  \n \n 69.

The \nbarrier this church faced was an 1885 federal law called the Alien Contract Labor \nLaw,72 which made it \u201cunlawful  . . . to prepay the transportation\u201d of a foreigner \u201cto \nperform labor or service of any kind in the United States.\u201d73 After the Holy Trinity \nChurch contracted to bring Mr. E. Walpole Warren to New York to serve as its rector \nand pastor, the United States brought suit, resulting in a case that eventually reached \nthe Supreme Court as Holy Trinity Church  v. United States .74 The question the Court \nconfronted was whether paying the transportation of a foreigner to come to the \nUnited States to serve as a pastor was proscribed by the Alien Contract Labor Law.75 \nJustice Brewer, writing for the Court, \u201cconceded\u201d at the outset of his opinion that \nthe church\u2019s action was \u201cwithin the letter\u201d of the law.76 But he argued \u2014in a now -\ninfamous line \u2014\u201cIt is a familiar rule[] that a thing may be within the letter of the \nstatute and yet not within the statute, because not within its spirit, nor within the \nintention of its makers.\u201d77 The spirit of the Alien Contract Labor Law, according to \nJustice Brewer, did not reach \u201cany class [of workers] whose toil is that of the \nbrain,\u201d78 such as ministers.  \nJustice Scalia, in his Tanner Lectures , excoriated Holy Trinity  as \u201cnothing \nbut judicial lawmaking.\u201d79 Be that as it may, the opinion is notable for its breezy \ndeployment of the concept of legislative intent \u2014as gleaned from the circumstances \nof the bill\u2019s passage and indications in the legislative history \u2014to trump an \ninterpretation the Court readily admitt ed followed from the plain text of the statute. \nIt has been cited by Supreme Court opinions 67 times since 1885, including by \nJustice Brennan (approvingly) in his majority opinion upholding voluntary race -\nconscious affirmative action plans by employers in United Steelworkers of America \nv. Weber80 and, more  recently, by Justice Scalia (disapprovingly) in his dissent in \nZuni Public School District No. 89 v. Department of Education .81 \nThis emphasis on legislative intent came under sustained fire from legal \nrealists. Max Radin called the attempt to \u201cdiscover the intent of the legislator\u201d on a \ngiven question of interpretation a \u201ctransparent and absurd fiction.\u201d82 Radin argued \nthat the intentions of the \u201cseveral hundred men\u201d who voted for or against a bill are \nlikely so disparate that there exists no single attributable \u201cintent\u201d with respect to a \nlitigated issue.83 And even if that intent existed, Radin thought it likely to be difficult \n \n 72.

Hart and Albert M. Sacks \u2014the fathers \nof the movement \u2014famously instructed that courts \u201cshould assume, unless the \ncontrary unmistakably appears, that the legislature was made up of reasonable \npersons pursuing reasonable purposes reasonably.\u201d95 The \u201ctask\u201d of interpreting, as \nthey saw it, started with deciding \u201cwhat purpose ought to be attributed to the statute\u201d \nand then \u201cinterpret[ing] the words of the statute immediately in question so as to \ncarry out the purpose as best it can.\u201d96 This highly purposive approach to statutory \ninterpretation was grounded in a political conviction that the legislative and \nadministrative organs of the state should be empowered to solve society\u2019s problems \nthrough lawmaking and that it was the institution al responsibility of the courts to \nassist that process.97 Thus, by 1940, the Supreme Court was again declaring that \n\u201ceven when the plain meaning [of a statute does] not produce absurd results but \nmerely an unreasonable one \u2018plainly at variance with the policy of the legislation as \na whole\u2019 this Court has followe d that purpose, rather than the literal words.\u201d98 \nReplacing \u201cintent\u201d with \u201cpurpose\u201d does not clearly answer the theoretical \nobjections of Radin and his followers. Just as a statute may be passed by legislators \nwith multiple or indiscernible intents, a statute  may serve multiple or indiscernible \npurposes.99 More to the point, the realist critique was not that statutes have no \npurposes at all, but only that the text is the only reliable evidence of that purpose. \nAbsent relevant statutory text, speculation as to a legislature\u2019s purposes \u2014even \nthrough the use of  extrinsic aids, like legislative history \u2014runs into the same \nproblems that Radin identified. Nonetheless, the success of the Legal Process School \nwas evident: \u201c[P]urpose -based interpretation, often drawing liberally on legislative \nhistory, dominated decision -making\u201d during the Vinson and Warren Courts.100 \nAt the same time, a slightly more aggressive form of purposivism also \nfound converts. It came to be known as \u201cimaginative reconstruction.\u201d101 As Posner \ndescribed it, this approach required that the interpreter of the statute \u201ctry to think his \nway as best he can into the minds of the enacting legislators and imagine how they \nwould have wanted the statute applied to the case at bar.\u201d102 Perhaps the best -known \nexponent of this approach was Judge Learned Hand : \u201cAccording to Hand, the judge \nshould ask what the legislature would have decided if the issue had occurred to the \nlegislators at the time of enactment.

Indeed, classic \npurposivism\u2019s emphasis on determining legislative intent or purpose from extrinsic \nsources coexist ed somewhat uncomfortably with an equally accepted early maxim \nof statutory interpretation: the plain -meaning rule. This protean form of textualism \nexhorted interpreters to follow the plain meaning of the statute\u2019s written terms \nwherever possible.106 As the Supreme Court phrased it, \u201c [W]here the language of an \nenactment is clear and construction according to its terms does not lead to absurd or \nimpractical consequences, the words employed are to be taken as the final \nexpression of the meaning intended.\u201d107 \nOne contemporaneous scholar observed that the \u201cmain effect\u201d of the plain -\nmeaning rule was to bar \u201cresort to otherwise admissible extrinsic \naids . . . evidencing the meaning or purpose of the enacting legislators,\u201d108 such as \ncommittee reports \u2014precisely the sort of materials that the search for legislative \nintent would require. The Supreme Court struck a compromise by permitting resort \nto such material \u201conly where [the] meaning is doubtful,\u201d109 implying that the plain -\nmeaning rule itself was simply a reliable method of determining legislative intent.110 \nIn this way, the plain -meaning rule and Holy Trinity -style purposivism can be seen \nas accepting the same baseline premise, despite the tension between their methods. \nThat premise is that statutory interpretation is a question of determining legislative \nintent.  \n \n 103.

William N. \nEskridge  Jr., Abbe R. Gluck, and Victoria F. Nourse have characterized the Burger \nCourt as a ready deployer of the \u201csoft\u201d plain -meaning rule, which \u201cfocused on text \nbut attempted to justify harsh textual results by using legislative history and statutory \npurposes to back them up.\u201d114 \nBut even this limited resort to legislative materials was soon to come under \nfire. By the mid -1980s, a cohort of conservative judges and officials in the Reagan \nAdministration\u2019s Department of Justice thought the Court\u2019s approach insufficiently \ntextualist.115 Led by Judge Frank Easterbrook and Justice Antonin Scalia,116 these \n\u201cnew textualists\u201d117 argued that the prevailing interpretive paradigm relied on an \nincoherent notion of legislative intent, drew on unreliable and manipulable sources \nof evidence to reconstruct that intent, and departed from the structural assumptions \nof the Constitution.118 As John F. Manning has written, the new textualists believed \nthat \u201clawmaking often entails compromise among interest groups with diverse \ngoals,\u201d leaving the words of the enacted statute as the most reliable \u2014and potentially \nonly\u2014evidence of Congress\u2019s \u201cpur pose.\u201d119 As a practical matter, the clearest \ninterpretive shift inaugurated by the new textualists was a religious objection to any \nuse of legislative history.120 \nUnsurprisingly, textualist scholars and judges also rejected imaginative \nreconstruction. Manning noted that \u201cimaginative reconstruction of legislative intent \nreflects implausible assumptions about the smoothness and transparency of the \n \n 111.

There \nwill not be a single objective, and discretionary interpretation favors some members \nof the winning coalition over others.\u201d123 Both believe that imaginative \nreconstruction produces outcomes that reflect the judge\u2019s preferences rather than \nthat of the legislature. \u201cImaginative reconstruction, asking how an expired Congress \nwould have answered a question had the subject been presented .  . . is of course \nfantasy  . . . , since we can imagine any answer we want when we are inventing both \nquestion  and answer.\u201d 124 \nNon-textualists have been equally skeptical  of imaginative reconstruction . \nJudge Posner was initially a fan125 but came to view the approach more critically. \nHe came to realize that imaginative reconstruction \u201crequires an exceedingly difficult \ncounterfactual inquiry and in practice is likely to be a mask for decision according \nto contemporary policy preferences rather than according to anything that can be \ndescribed  . . . as the  . . . purposes of the people who enacted the statute.\u201d126 Eskridge \nand Frickey write similarly that imaginative reconstruction \u201cis indeterminate\u201d and \n\u201coften asks counterfactual questions of a long -departed legislature\u201d on issues that \nthe legislature did not anticipate.127 Additionally, \u201cthe theory rests upon the \nquestionable assumption that judges will be able to recreate the historical \nunderstanding of a previous legislature.

While earlier textualist critiques drew on insights from \npublic -choice theory \u2014emphasizing the role of interest groups in shaping \nlegislation \u2014Scalia grounded his version of textualism on the \u201cdemocratic theory\u201d \nembedded in the Constitution\u2019s separation of powers; he rejected the notion that \n\u201claws mean whatever they ought to mean, and  that unelected judges decide what \nthat is.\u201d137 Any search for legislative intent compatible with \u201cdemocratic \ngovernment,\u201d Scalia argued, should be limited to \u201ca sort of \u2018objectified\u2019 intent \u2014the \nintent that a reasonable person would gather from the text of the law , placed \n \n 131.

The Roberts Court  \nUnder Chief Justice John Roberts, these trends have only accelerated.147 As \nhas often been observed,148 text-based interpretive techniques now reign mostly \nunchallenged over the pragmatic and purposive methods of the Warren Court. To be \nsure, the narrative of the rise of textualism and the fall of (a certain type of) \npurposivism masks a complex reality; and , as others have observed, textualism\u2019s so -\ncalled triumph may be greater in rhetoric than reality.149 But our focus here is less \non whether textualism in fact dominates statutory interpretation in state and federal \ncourts than on how far the current conversation on statutory interpretation is from \nthe high purposivism of Currie\u2019s era.  \nFor instance, the Court\u2019s methodological debate now focuses mostly on \ninternecine debates within a textualist universe. In Bostock v. Clayton County ,150 the \nCourt confronted whether Title VII\u2019s prohibition on sex -based discrimination in \nemployment reaches discrimination151 on the basis of sexual orientation and gender \nidentity.152 The Court held, 6 \u20133, that it does, generating three different opinions \u2014\nwith all writing justices professing to employ textualism. Justice Gorsuch, for the \nmajority, exemplified what Tara Leigh Grove has called \u201cformalistic textualism,\u201d \nwhich \u201cinstructs interpreters to carefully parse the statutory language, focusing on \nsemantic context and dow nplaying policy concerns or the practical (even \nmonumental) consequences of the case.\u201d153 Justice Alito wrote a scathing dissent, \njoined by Justice Thomas, where  he accused the majority of writing an opinion \u201clike \na pirate ship\u201d that \u201csails under a textualist flag\u201d while embracing an atextual and \ndynamic form of statutory interpretation.154 Alito \u2014and Justice Kavanaugh in a \nseparate, more measured dissent \u2014exemplified a \u201cflexible textualism\u201d (to again \nborrow Grove\u2019s terms), which took under consideration \u201cpolicy and social context \n \n 147. This is not to say that some form of purposivism has not lived on at the Court, \nthough often unacknowledged as such. See generally Anita S. Krishnakumar, Backdoor \nPurposivism , 69 DUKE L.J. 1275 (2020) (making this case). As Krishnakumar writes, \u201cthe \nCourt, and its textualist Justices in particular, regularly employ pragmatic reasoning as well \nas supposedly neutral textualist tools to divine \u2014or manufacture \u2014congressional purpose and \nintent. \u201d Id. at 1279. Yet Krishnakumar admits, as we argue in Subsection  III.C.2, that \n\u201calthough classic purposivism is often characterized as directing courts to privilege the spirit \nover the letter of the statute, modern purposivists regularly pay close attention to statutory \ntext.\u201d Id. at 1283.  \n 148.

Attempts to reconstruct \nthe actual intent of the legislators or to apply an imagined intent to a new factual \nscenario would contravene both the structural underpinnings of the U.S. \nConstitution and most state constitut ions and would utilize materials that ordinary \npeople cannot readily access . \nWhat this means is that under modern methods of statutory interpretation, \nstatutory silence  as to a particular subject matter \u2014say, the multi -state applicability \nof a statute \u2014cannot be filled with mere hypotheses about what the legislature would \nhave wanted. Such silence is, rather, exactly what it looks like: nothing at all. Absent \na statutory t ext that has passed the procedural hurdles and can be read by ordinary \ncitizens, interpretation cannot go further by speculating about the legislature\u2019s \nultimate pur poses. As will be discussed, various presumptions (or canons) can \noccasionally fill that void. But importantly, those presumptions operate as consistent \nbackground rules, operating to stabilize outcomes across cases \u2014and to alert the \nlegislature of the cons equences of their silence \u2014rather than to faithfully embody an \natextual legislative purpose.  \nPurposivism, too, has undergone a dramatic transformation. The death of \nclassic purposivism is such that even those who would not identify themselves as \ntextualists have \u201ccaught the new textualism bug.\u201d157 Indeed, Gluck has observed that \nthe idea that legislative history or imagined purpose can trump unambiguous text is \n\u201cdead.\u201d158 At the Supreme Court, the liberal justices \u2014who are most comfortable \nwith the purposivist label \u2014readily deploy the same text -centric interpretive \ntechniques as their conservative brethren.159 \nOf course, the use of textualism may at times be a pragmatic strategy to \nwin votes in close cases. But modern purposivists have also taken to heart many of \nthe criticisms leveled by textualists. Practiced irresponsibly, purposivism can be \narbitrary and und emocratic, permitting judges to abuse their authority by imposing \ntheir policy preferences on open -ended legislation.160 As Manning has observed, \ncontemporary purposivists have accepted the proposition that \u201cfidelity to legislative \n \n 155.

In \nshort, while purposivists retain their theoretical commitment to serving as the \nfaithful agents of a purposive legislative body, the Court as a whole \u201cnow takes  its \ncues directly from Congress about how and to what degree to take background \npurpose or policy into account.\u201d163 This focus on what Manning has called \n\u201cimplemental purpose\u201d (and not just the background public policy informing the \nstatute) has made purposivism self -consciously more text -focused.164 \nAt the same time, other textualists have argued that the modern \npurposivism of the Roberts Court still permits legislative purpose or pragmatic \nconsiderations to play a role in determining whether a statute is textually ambiguous \nand, if so, how to resolve  that ambiguity.165 That is one way of saying, of course, \nthat the narrative of the decline of classical purposivism at the Supreme Court is not \nstraightforward. For instance, while admitting that purposivism has evolved \nsignificantly in response to the textualist revolution , Professor  Anita S. \nKrishnakumar has carefully documented the ways in which purposivists at the Court \nhave continued to make appeals to legislative intent,166 while self -avowed textualists \nhave snuck in purposivism through \u201cbackdoor\u201d methodologies.167 (As we shall see \nin Part IV, the Court has done something like this in implementing its presumption \nagainst extraterritoriality.) Yet Krishnakumar has also observed that invocations of \npurpose or intent are often woven together \u201cwith more text -based tools \u201d168\u2014a \ntechnique conspicuously unavailable for many choice -of-law questions. So far as \nthis Article is concerned, then, the important point is that few now defend the high \npurposivism that is integral to Currie -style interest analysis, even as the practice of \nstatutory interpretation reflects a messier reality.  \n* * *  \nAs a question of general statutory interpretation, the classical purposivism \nof the Legal Process era is now mostly dormant \u2014and largely undefended \u2014in the \nfederal courts. To be sure, pockets of classical purposivism remain within certain \nareas of law ,169 including, as this Article argues, in the choice -of-law realm.

But it is important here to underscore what the Court is not doing. It is \nnot imagining what outcome the legislature would have wanted in a particular case , \nnor would it permit statutory silence  to be filled through unrestrained judicial \nspeculation on a legislature\u2019s purposes.171 Yet that is precisely the strategy that \nCurrie -style interest analysis envisions.  \nD. The View from the States  \nBefore evaluating how Currie\u2019s interest analysis stacks up next to modern \nstatutory interpretation, it is necessary to address one obvious lacuna  in the above \nnarrative: while the story told above is true enough for the U.S. Supreme Court, the \nvast majority of choice -of-law problems are confronted by state courts. An \nequally \u2014if not more \u2014relevant question is, then, to what extent has the \nabandonment of atextual legislative intent or purpose occurred for state courts \napplying state law ? \nThe first comprehensive survey of state statutory interpretation was \nGluck\u2019s 2010 article taking up the question.172 Gluck found that states have followed \nthe federal trend with a caveat, adopting what she calls \u201cmodified textualism\u201d \u2014a \nform of textualism that differs from its federal cousin only in that : (a) it permits \nrecourse to legislative history when text is ambiguous , and (b) it provides a clear \nhierarchy of sources of meaning (text first, followed by legislative history, followed \nby substantive canons).173 Though Gluck\u2019s analysis centers on five key states, her \npreliminary research revealed that many other states follow a similar text -centric \u2014\nyet pragmatic \u2014model of interpretation.174 The conclusions are necessarily general; \ncertain jurisdictions (notably New York and the District of Columbia) retain a more \neclectic and purposive approach to statutory interpretation.175 But Gluck notes that \nthe Connecticut Supreme Court reached a conclusion similar to hers when it tried to \nabandon the plain -meaning rule, conceding  that this move would \u201cput it in the \n\u2018minority\u2019 among state courts.\u201d176 \nMore recently, Austin Peters has made use of natural -language processing \nand machine -learning tools to code over 44,000 state  court opinions according to \n \n 170.

Nonetheless, the Connecticut Supreme \nCourt \u201chas been very reluctant to apply the overruling statute. \u201d Id. \n2025] GOVERNMENTAL INTEREST ANALYSIS  417 \nhow often they use tools associated with textualism.177 His findings are consonant \nwith Gluck\u2019s. In particular, he notes that \u201cthe use of textualism in state supreme \ncourt opinions has risen rapidly since 1980,\u201d with a particular emphasis on invoking \na statute\u2019s \u201cplain meaning.\u201d178 But the states are not uniform in rejecting atextual \nmethods of statutory interpretation. According to Peters, the \u201ctextualist intensity \nscore\u201d of the most textualist state (New Hampshire) is ten times that of the least \ntextualist state (Oregon).179 \nThough states have not followed the U.S. Supreme Court in complete \nlockstep, even the modified textualism that Gluck observed among  the states is \nnotable primarily for what it does not endorse. First, it permits recourse to material \noutside a statutory text only when that text is ambiguous \u2014not when it is entirely \nsilent. Second, even though the use of legislative history may be permitted to clear \nup ambiguity or to attempt to find the second -best source of legislative purpose, \nthere is no indication that st ate courts generally permit the invention  or presumption  \nof a legislature\u2019s purposes when both statutory text and other extrinsic sources of \nmeaning are silent. Rather, as Gluck indicates, if both text and legislative history fail \nto provide an answer, modified textualism resorts to the deployment of clear, \nconsistent canons of construction \u2014\u201cclassic\u201d textualism\u2019s preferred tools.180 That \nstate courts are generally more amenable to legislative history, while the U.S. \nSupreme Court relies more on canons, is thus somewhat beside the point for present \npurposes. No predominant method of statutory interpretation, state or federal, \npermits a court to invent a purpose on behalf of a silent legislature.  \nState courts have therefore mostly abandoned the pretension that they are \nqualified to fill in the blanks for a silent legislature, following belatedly in the wake \nof the interpretive revolution that has taken place in the federal courts.181 To be sure, \nout-and-out purposivism of the Legal Process variety is not entirely dead in the \nstates.182 Even so, when courts look for legislative intent outside the text of a statute, \nthey typically rely on other  texts \u2014for instance, legislative history \u2014as substitutes.183 \nOutside the context of choice of law, the imaginative reconstruction of a legislature\u2019s \nintent on a specific question \u2014e.g., whether a law should apply to a set of out -of-\nstate facts \u2014has become a relic of an earlier era of interpretation.  \n \n 177.

ASSESSING GOVERNMENTAL INTEREST ANALYSIS AS \nSTATUTORY INTERPRETATION  \nAs discussed in Part I, Currie\u2019s innovation was not to regard choice of law \nas a matter of statutory interpretation; it was to bring a particular approach to \nstatutory interpretation to bear on the matter: the high purposivism of the Legal \nProcess School. Given the centrality of purpose to governmental interest analysis, it \nis past time to consider how well governmental interest analysis holds up in the harsh \nlight that recent judicial and scholarly critiques have shone on purposivist techniques \nof statutor y interpretation.  \nAs discussed in Part I, choice -of-law analysis assumes that in the absence \nof specific evidence that the legislature addressed the question of a statute\u2019s multi -\nstate applicability, the legislature enacted the statute with the purely domestic case \nin mind and gave no thought to the question of the statute\u2019s multi -state applicability. \nGiven this assumption, it is clear that in the types of cases that concern us here, the \nlegislature had no views \u2014and hence no purpose \u2014on the specific question of the \nstatute\u2019s multi -state applicability.184 In placing legislative purpose front and center \nin the courts\u2019 analysis, therefore, Currie could only have been referring to the \nlegislature\u2019s purpose in the purely internal case . In Section III.A, we discuss some \nof the challenges a court faces in ascertaining a statute\u2019s purposes in that context.  \nIn Section III.B, we assume for argument\u2019s sake that courts can reliably \nidentify a statute\u2019s purposes in the purely internal case, and we consider what we \ntake to be Currie\u2019s key claim: that a statute\u2019s multi -state applicability can be derived, \nas a matter of interpreta tion, from the purposes the legislature sought to advance in \nthe purely internal case. Drawing upon the main insights of the modern critique of \npurposivism, we argue that the legislature\u2019s purposes in the purely internal case \ncannot straight forwardly support any particular inferences about the legislature\u2019s \nlikely preferences with respect to the question of the statute\u2019s multi -state \napplicability. Under the prevailing paradigm of statutory interpretation, then, \nCurrie\u2019s project must fail out of the sta rting gate. Subsequent scholarly \ndevelopments of Currie\u2019s theory have sought to alleviate some of the concerns we \ndiscuss in Section III.B, but we show in Section III.C that these improvements fail \nto salvage governmental interest analysis from t he perspective of Currie\u2019s \nmotivating justification for the technique: fidelity to the legislature\u2019s preferences.  \nA. Identifying a Law\u2019s Purposes in the Purely Domestic Case  \nCurrie argued that a court should interpret a law as to its multi -state \napplicability \u201cin order to effectuate the legislative purpose.\u201d185 Because in the cases \nthat concerned him , the legislature did not think about the statute\u2019s multi -state \napplicability, and hence had no purpose on that question, Currie must have been \n \n 184. As discussed in Part II, textualists and nontextualists disagree on the propriety \nof considering legislative history.  We will sidestep that debate by assuming that the legislative \nhistory is equally silent on the question of the statute \u2019s multi -state reach.  Like Currie, we are \nprimarily interested in the claim that a statute \u2019s multi -state applicability can be derived from \nthe substantive  provisions of the statute even when the legislature has left that issue \nunaddressed.  \n 185.

Currie\u2019s approach thus rests on the view that a statute\u2019s multi -\nstate applicability can be derived from its purpose in the purely domestic case \u2014\nwhich we will call the law\u2019s \u201csubstantive\u201d purpose.  \nWe will consider in the next Section whether a law\u2019s purpose in the purely \ndomestic context can, by itself, yield any reliable conclusions regarding the \nlegislature\u2019s preferences on the question of the law\u2019s multi -state applicability. In this \nSection, we d iscuss some complications and uncertainties that arise in trying to \nidentify a law\u2019s purposes even in the purely domestic setting. These complications \nbear out the theoretical critiques of high purposivism discussed in Part II.  \nThe first difficulty is the contestability of attributing a particular purpose \nto the legislature. Consider Currie\u2019s conclusion regarding the purpose of the \nMassachusetts statute involved in Milliken . As discussed in Part I, this statute \nrendered the contracts of married women unenforceable. Currie concluded that the \nstatute reflected the Massachusetts legislature\u2019s view that married women were a \ncategory needing special protection, an understanding o f coverture laws that harkens \nback to Blackstone, who wro te that \u201cthe disabilities, which the wife lies under, are \nfor the most part intended for her protection and benefit.\u201d186 This conclusion is \ncontestable (to say the least). Far from \u201cprotecting\u201d married women, such laws had \nthe likely effect (and purpose) of maintaining married women in a subservient \nrelationship to their husbands.187 \nThe feminist critique of coverture laws is forceful and compelling, but \nCurrie might respond that his theory can easily withstand the critique. The critique\u2019s \nrevised understanding of the purpose of the Massachusetts law, he might argue, does \nnot require m uch of a modification of his proposed analysis. To the extent his \nanalysis focuses on the category of persons the law protects, one can simply \nsubstitute the married women\u2019s husbands  for the married women themselves as the \nbenefited part ies and proceed muc h as before.  \nPerhaps so, but another key insight of the textualist critique of purposivism \nis that a statute seldom, if ever, reflects a unitary purpose. Statutes are the outcome \nof a process in which numerous policies, many in conflict with each other, are \nconsidered and assessed by the legislature. The legislature weighs and balances \nthose policies, and the statute that emerges from this process is a compromise among \nthose policies.188 To describe the sole purpose of the Massachusetts law as the \nprotection of married women (or their husbands) is in tension with this insight.  \nCurrie did not completely overlook this point. He acknowledged that the \nMassachusetts legislature had taken into account not just the interests of married \n \n 186. 1 WILLIAM BLACKSTONE , COMMENTARIES  *430, *433.  \n 187.

The legislature\u2019s purpose in the purely internal case \u2014the purpose that \ndrives the court\u2019s interest analysis \u2014is the promotion of the policy that prevailed  in \nthe legislative battle.  \nBut the conclusion that the side seeking to protect married women (or their \nhusbands) prevailed is itself contestable. Imagine that some in the legislature wanted \nto protect married women by invalidating their contracts and imposing a fine on \nanyone attempting to enter into a contract with a married woman. Others believed \nthat doing so would infringe too much on freedom of contract and preferred to \ninvalidate the contracts of married women without imposing a fine. If the out come \nwas a law invalidating the c ontracts of married women but not imposing a fine, \nwould we say that the side seeking to protect freedom of contract prevailed? Again, \nthe point is that legislation reflects a particular balancing of contending interests, \nand the resolution of that conflic t does not tell us much about how the legislature \nwould have resolved matters not addressed in the statute.  \nOne might attempt to rescue Currie from this critique by pointing out that \nthe other state with connections to the dispute (Maine) had emancipated married \nwomen, recognizing the enforceability of their contracts. As compared to the law of \nMaine , one might legitimately concur with Currie\u2019s claim that the law of \nMassachusetts benefits married women (or their husbands). But notice that this \nargument seeks to ascertain the relative purpose of a law. If this is the analysis \ncontemplated by Currie, a law may have  one purpose when compared to the law of \nMaine but a different purpose when compared to the law of New Hampshire. For \nexample, assume that the law of New Hampshire not only renders the contracts of \nmarried women unenforceable but also imposes a fine on any one who attempts to \nenter into a contract with a married woman. Compared to New Hampshire\u2019s law, the \n\u201cpurpose\u201d of the Massachusetts statute would be to protect persons who would like \nto enter into contracts with married women. In sum, although t he law of a  given \nstate, considered in the abstract, cannot be said to have a general  purpose to protect \none set of persons or burden another set of persons except to the extent specified , it \nmight  plausibly be said to reflect a purpose of protecting a given group more than \nthe law of another state does.  \nIf this is how Currie would have courts identify a statute\u2019s purpose in the \nchoice -of-law context, however, his theory fails on its own terms. Currie presents \nhis theory as simply the application to the question of a law\u2019s multi -state \napplicability  of the same technique courts commonly apply to resolve issues of \n \n 189. See Currie, supra note 5 1, at 233.  \n 190. Id. \n2025] GOVERNMENTAL INTEREST ANALYSIS  421 \ninterpretation in purely domestic cases.191 But Currie\u2019s attribution to the \nMassachusetts legislature of a particular purpose to \u201cprotect\u201d or \u201cbenefit\u201d a \nparticular subclass of Massachusetts citizens rests ultimately on a comparison of the \ncontent of the Massachusetts law with the content of the la ws of the other states with \nconnections to the dispute. Far from extending to the multi -state case the same \nmethod that courts use to decide interpretive questions that arise in purely internal \ncases, Currie\u2019s approach to identifying a law\u2019s purpose is one  that, in fact, is specific \nto\u2014and can be applied only to \u2014multi -state cases. We can attribute a purpose to the \nlaw only in comparison to the laws of other states. The highly context -dependent \nnature of Currie\u2019s attribution of a purpose to a given law disti nguishes it \nfundamentally from the way a court identifies a law\u2019s purpose in \u201cmarginal domestic \nsituations.\u201d192 \nMaking matters worse, Currie unjustifiably assumes that all statutes reflect \nthe legislature\u2019s consequentialist weighing of the interests of contending domestic \ninterest groups \u2014an assumption  suggested by the very term \u201cinterest analysis.\u201d This \nassumption overlooks the possibility that a given law reflects commitments of a \nmore deontological character. The legislature may have adopted the rule based on \nnotions of natural law or natural justice,  or because it believed the rule to reflect the \nmost just solutio n to the problem it was addressing. Laws enacted on these grounds \ndo not lend themselves to Currie\u2019s approach to determining their multi -state \napplicability. If the legislature adopted a rule because, in its view, the rule reflects \nnatural law or natural j ustice, it may well prefer that the law be applied universally. \nIf the legislature were open to limiting the multi -state applicability of such a law, it \nwould presumably rest any such limits on considerations very different from the \nones that Currie would have had courts take into account: for instance, doubts about \nthe appropriateness of imposing its own notions of justice on societies with different \nvalues or circumstances, or a desire to reduce the interstate friction that would result \nfrom an aggressive  application of local values.193 As discussed in the next Section, \nthese are the types of considerations that Currie sought to banish from the choice -\nof-law calculus. Complicating the analysis, a given statute may reflect a combination \nof consequentialist and deontological purposes. Some  legislators may have favored \nthe rule that was ultimately adopted because it benefits certain of their constituents , \nand other legislators may have favored the rule because they considered it the most \njust rule.  \nB. Interpreting a Law as to Its Multi -State Applicability  \nLet\u2019s assume for argument\u2019s sake that courts are able to distinguish laws \nenacted for consequentialist reasons from laws that reflect the legislators\u2019 \n \n 191.

And let\u2019s assume further that it is possible to attribute \na purpose to a law by comparing it to the laws of other interested states ( in the face \nof Currie\u2019s claim to be simply applying to the multi -state case the same interpretive \nprinciples that courts apply to the purely internal case). Even overlooking these \nchallenges, Currie\u2019s purposivist approach is plagued by additional \u2014and in our view \ninsuper able\u2014problems. Currie assumes that courts may infer the legislature\u2019s \npreferences regarding the law\u2019s multi -state applicability  from the purposes  it sought \nto advance in purely internal cases . In this Section , we show that even if the \nlegislature\u2019s substantive purpose can be reliably identified, no particular legislative \npreferences regarding multi -state applicability can be straightforwardly derived  \nfrom that purpose.  \nConsider again Currie\u2019s analysis of Milliken v. Meyer . As discussed above, \nCurrie concluded that the purpose of Massachusetts\u2019 s law rendering the contracts of \nmarried women unenforceable was to protect married women.194 What does that tell \nus about the Massachusetts legislature\u2019s preferences regarding the multi -state \napplicability of the law? To answer that question, Currie asked: \u201c What  married \nwomen [was it Massachusetts\u2019 s policy to protect]?\u201d His answer was: \u201cWhy, those \nwith whose welfare Massachusetts is concerned, of course \u2014i.e., Massachusetts \nmarried women.\u201d195 Because the statute was intended to benefit Massachusetts  \nmarried women, he concluded, the statute should be applied to all contracts of \nmarried women from Massachusetts and no contracts of married women from \nMaine.  \nBut even if we granted Currie his assumptions, we would not be able to \nconclude with any confidence that his analysis captures the legislature\u2019s likely \npreferences regarding the law\u2019s multi -state applicability. Currie assumed that the \npurpose of the Massac husetts legislature was to protect Massachusetts married \nwomen because these were the women \u201cwith whose welfare Massachusetts is \nconcerned.\u201d But it is more accurate to say (if we assume a provincial legislature, as \nCurrie does) that the Massachusetts legis lature is concerned with the welfare of \nMassachusetts citizens writ large, not just Massachusetts married women. As Currie \nhimself recognized, the Massachusetts statute reflects the legislature\u2019s balancing of \ncompeting interests. The legislature considered countervailing policies such as \n\u201cfreedom of contract,  . . . the security of commercial transactions, \n[and]  . . . vindicating the reasonable expectations of promises,\u201d and it subordinated \nthese policies to the policy of protecting married women.196 But our \u2014and his \u2014\nstarting assumption is that the legislature enacted the statute with only the purely \ndomestic case in mind. If so, all we can say is that the legislature subordinated the \ninterests of Massachusetts creditors in favor of the perceived need to protect \nMassachusetts married women only in the purely domestic context \u2014that is, in cases \nin which  everyone was from Massachusetts and everything took place there. By \nhypothesis, the legislature did not balance the relevant interests in the multi -state \ncase.  \n \n 194. See Currie, supra  note 51, at 234. \n 195. Id. \n 196. Id. at 233.  \n2025] GOVERNMENTAL INTEREST ANALYSIS  423 \nIf the legislature had considered the multi -state case, it might have balanced \nthe interest in protecting married women and the interest in protecting freedom of \ncontract differently, even if it was only concerned with the welfare of Massachusetts  \ncitizens or residents . Its decision to subordinate the interest of creditors to those of \nmarried women in the purely domestic case may have been based on its assumption \nthat Bay Staters generally have no choice but to enter into contracts with other Bay \nStaters. B ut persons from other states have the option of doing business with Granite \nStaters or Down Easters instead. If the legislature had expanded its lens to include \nmulti -state cases, it might have been concerned that giving Massachusetts married \nwomen a right  to avoid contracts with out -of-staters might lead out -of-staters in \ngeneral to be hesitant to enter into contracts with Bay Staters \u2014even Bay Staters who \nare not married women.197 Out-of-staters might lose faith in Massachusetts\u2019 s general \ncommitment to enforcing contracts. Had the legislature considered the multi -state \ncase, it might have concluded that the cost to Massachusetts  citizens wishing to do \nbusiness with out -of-staters  of extending its coverture rule  to contracts made outside \nMassachusetts , when added to the general costs to Massachusetts citizens that the \nlegislature had weighed in the purely domestic case, tips the balance against \napplying the coverture rule to at least some multi -state cases. The legislature might \nwell have preferred to apply this policy of protecting married women only to \nMassachusetts married women entering into contracts with other  Massachusetts \ncitizens  or entering into contracts with anyone  in Massachusetts . It cannot be said \nthat a rational Massachusetts legislature would have necessarily decided to extend \nits law invalidating married women\u2019s contracts to all multi -state cases involving the \ncontracts of Massachusetts married women. A court cannot confidentl y predict that \nthe legislature would have balanced the competing interests the same way in the \nmulti -state case as in the purely internal case.198 \nCurrie\u2019s analysis also overlooks yet another key insight of modern statutory \ninterpretation scholarship: no statute seeks to advance a single purpose at all costs, \nand the legislature\u2019s choice of means reflects its views about how far any given \ngovernmental policy should be advanced at the expense of competing policies.199 \nSpecifically, Currie\u2019s approach fails to consider an entire category of costs that \nmight have led a legislature to limit the multi -state applicability of its internal law if \nit had thought about the issue. As noted, Currie took the position that a forum s tatute \nshould be construed to extend to a multi -state case whenever doing so would \nadvance the substantive governmental policy reflected in the statute, even if another \nstate also has an interest in applying its (different) law.200 This approach risks \n \n 197.

This insight would not have altered Currie \u2019s proposed resolution of the \nMilliken  case itself, but it would have altered his proposed resolution of the converse case \u2014\none involving a contract made in Maine involving a Massachusetts married woman.

Greater i nterstate animosity is a cost of adopting Currie\u2019s policy of fully \nadvancing the interest in protecting Massachusetts married women. Averting such \nhostility is almost certain to be an additional interest  of the Massachusetts \nlegislature, as it risks a tit -for-tat that could disadvantage Massachusetts citizens. It \nis very possible that the legislature would have found the interest in protecting \nmarried women to be outweighed by the combined interests of Mas sachusetts \ncitizens in protect ing security of transactions plus avoiding interstate animosity.  \nCurrie was not blind to (all of) these critiques. He did consider the \npossibility that a Massachusetts legislature would weigh the domestically  relevant \ninterests differently in the multi -state context.201 He described this scenario as \nreflecting the possibility \u201cthat local policy is relatively weak, and suitable only for \nhome consumption.\u201d202 But he expressly rejected an approach that would have the \ncourts weigh the strength of the forum\u2019s policies against those of other states, and \nhe rejected reliance on systemic, multilateral considerations, such as the need to \navoid interstate friction or to avoid forum  shopping. He considered some of these \nvalues \u2014e.g., avoidance of forum shopping \u2014to be overrated, but he mainly \nbanished these values from the choice -of-law inquiry because he believed that it was \nnot a proper function of courts to pass judgment on the quality or strength of the \npolicies its legislature has enacted or to weigh those policies against those of other \nstates.203 For this reason, he argued that courts should play for the home team, so to \nspeak, and always apply forum law if doing so would advance the legislature\u2019s \npurpose in enacting the law.204 \nCurrie\u2019s reasons for banishing these considerations from the choice -of-law \nanalysis may or may not have been sound , but the result \u2014a single -minded focus on \nadvancing domestic purposes \u2014cannot in any meaningful sense be said to reflect the \nlegislature\u2019s likely preferences, if they could even be discerned. Currie\u2019s interest \nanalysis can therefore no more claim the mantle  of fidelity  to legislative preferences \nthan any number of other approaches, including the traditional approaches.205 He \nconceived of the choice -of-law issue as a matter of ordinary interpretation, and he \nurged courts to address the issue by \u201ctry[ing] to decide [the question] as it believes \n[the legislature] would have decided [it] had it foreseen the problem.\u201d206 He sold his \napproach as preferable to the traditional approach because, in his view, it was more \n \n 201.

The legislature might, in the end, have decided to provide for a broad multi -\nstate application of its substantive rule, as Currie favored, but it might not ha ve. \nInsofar as Cu rrie\u2019s approach categorically rules out consideration of these \nmultilateral  concerns, it cannot claim to reflect legislative preferences any more \nclosely than any number of other possible approaches to the interpretive issue.208 \nC. Multi lateral Approaches to Determining a Law\u2019s Multi -State Applicability  \nSome second -generation proponents of governmental interest analysis \nrefined Currie\u2019s approach in a way that seeks to alleviate this last criticism of his \ntheory. Currie argued for applying a forum state\u2019s law to any case in which  the \nlegislature\u2019s domestic purposes would be advanced, without regard to the existence \nor weight of the other states\u2019 interests, and without any consideration of interstate or \ninternational friction.209 This aggressive approach to the application of forum law \ndid not garner much support among courts and scholars. While like -minded courts \nand scholars generally viewed the identification of \u201cfalse conflicts\u201d as a huge \nadvance in choice -of-law thinking, som e sought an approach that considered multi -\nlateral considerations  in resolving true conflicts. These approaches refined \ngovernmental interest analysis by taking into account factors that Currie excluded \nfrom the calculus in the event of a \u201ctrue conflict.\u201d As techniques for ascertaining the \nlikely preferences of the legi slature with respect to the multi -state applicability of \nstatutes, they represent an advance over Currie\u2019s original approach. But the results \nthey produce cannot be said with much confidence to capture the actual preferences \nof the legislature regarding the law\u2019s multi -state applicability. In this Section, we \nconsider two such approaches.  \n1. Comparative Impairment  \nProfessor William Baxter proposed his \u201ccomparative impairment\u201d \napproach as a refinement of Currie\u2019s interest analysis.210 Baxter explicitly presented \nhis comparative -impairment approach as an attempt to discover the likely intent of \na legislature regarding whether to apply forum law in the face of a true conflict.211 \n \n 207. See, e.g. , BRAINERD CURRIE , SELECTED ESSAYS ON THE CONFLICT OF LAWS 727 \n(1963) (\u201cIt is explicitly an attempt to determine legislative purposes  . . . .\u201d); Brainerd Currie, \nThe Disinterested Third State , 28 LAW & CONTEMP . PROBS . 754, 761 (1963) ( \u201c[O]ur system \nof government invests [legislatures] with power to make laws for the expression of \ngovernmental policy, and to define the scope of governmental interests.

For a forceful argument that Currie was not really ascertaining the legislature \u2019s \nreferences but was instead constructing them, see Lea Brilmayer, supra , note 23, at  399\u2013402. \n 209. See Currie, supra note 51, at 261 \u201362. \n 210. See William F. Baxter, Choice of Law and the Federal System , 16 STAN. L. \nREV. 1, 18 (1963).  \n 211. See id.  at 8\u20139. \n426 ARIZONA LAW REVIEW  [VOL. 67: 391 \nHe agreed with Currie that weighing conflicting substantive interests was not a \nproper role for the courts, but he thought that courts were  capable of determining \nthe extent to which the law\u2019s substantive policy would be impaired if not applied in \na given multi -state situation. He accordingly proposed that in true -conflict cases, the \ncourt should apply the law that would be most impaired if not applied. Widespread \nadoption of this approach to resolving  true conflicts, he argued, would maximize the \noverall a chievement of substantive state interests.212 The courts of California have \nadopted comparative impairment as their method of resolving true conflicts.213 \nBaxter\u2019s approach is more defensible as statutory interpretation than \nCurrie\u2019s, as it recognizes that the legislature would have been concerned about the \ncosts of an aggressive approach. But his analysis is applicable only in true -conflict \nsituations, and he adopts Currie\u2019s approach to identifying  true conflicts. Thus, \nBaxter\u2019s approach suffers from all of the problems outlined above concerning how \nthe court identifies a statute\u2019s substantive purpose s. \nMore importantly, even after identifying a true conflict, the comparative -\nimpairment approach carries over Currie\u2019s admonition to treat all policies as equal. \nBaxter expressly disavowed the weighing of policies.214 Like Currie, he defended \nthis constraint on the ground s that weighing conflicting state policies is not a proper \nrole for courts. Be that as it may, the fact remains that state legislatures do attach \ndifferent degrees of importance to their policies. By assuming that all states give \nequal weight to their policies, the comparative -impairment analysis fails to capture  \nthe likely preferences of the legislature concerning the statute\u2019s multi -state \napplicability . Thus, as an approach that seeks to ascertain and give effect to the likely \npreferences of the legislature, comparative impairment is almost as problematic as \nCurrie\u2019s approach. Currie and Baxter both missed that if they exclude from the \ncourts\u2019 consideration factors that the legislature would have considered had it \naddressed the question, their methods lose their claims to superiority as method s of \npredicting the likely preferences of the legislature.  \n2. The Second Restatement  \nAs applied by the California courts, if not as intended by Baxter, \ncomparative impairment resembles the approach of states that use the \u201cmost \nsignificant relationship\u201d test of the Restatement  (Second)  of Conflict of Laws  as a \nway to resolve true conflicts.215 The Second Restatement  combined elements of \n \n 212. See id.  at 18 \u201319. \n 213. See, e.g., Bernhard v. Harrah \u2019s Club, 546 P.2d 719 , 720 \u201321 (Cal. 1976) , \nsuperseded by statute , CAL. CIV. CODE \u00a7 1714 (20 11)). \n 214. See Baxter, supra note 210, at 13.  \n 215. The Second Restatement  does not explicitly set forth the \u201cmost significant \nrelationship \u201d test as a mechanism for resolving true conflicts.  Nevertheless, there is some \nbasis in the Second Restatement  for approaching the test in this manner, and some courts have \ndone so. See, e.g. , Phillips v. Gen . Motors Corp.,  995 P.2d 1002, 100 5 (Mont. 2000) ; see also  \nRESTATEMENT (THIRD ) OF CONFLICT OF L. \u00a7 5.01 cmt. b ( AM. L.

In \nexplicating and applying comparative impairment, the California courts have departed from \n \n2025] GOVERNMENTAL INTEREST ANALYSIS  427 \ngovernmental interest analysis with consideration of expressly multilateral factors , \ngenerally calling for courts to apply the law of the state with the \u201cmost significant \nrelationship\u201d to the issue in question.216 It identifies a number of \u201cfactors\u201d and \n\u201cprinciples\u201d to be taken into account in determining which state has the most \nsignificant relationship.217 The approach has been criticized as highly indeterminate, \nleaving courts with largely unguided discretion. As some have derided it, the Second \nRestatement  instructs courts to take all the relevant facts and state policies into \naccount, giving those policies the weight they deserve in light of the purposes of the \ninterstate and international system.218 Despite (or, perhaps, because of) the wide \ndiscretion it affords to courts in the choice -of-law inquiry, the Second Restatement  \nhas proved to be popular among the courts. It is the most widely used choice -of-law \napproach in the United States today, having been adopted by roughly half of the \nstates.219 Some courts apply the Second Restatement \u2019s approach as if it were a form \nof interest analysis.220 Others apply the \u201cmost significant relationship test\u201d as a \nmechanism for resolving true conflicts.221 The Second Restatement  effectively asks \ncourts to replicate the process the legislature would have followed if it had addressed \nthe issue of the statute\u2019s multi -state applicability to the case at hand.  \nEven so, the results reached by courts in applying the Second Restatement  \ncannot confidently be said to reflect legislative preferences. Even more than Currie\u2019s \noriginal approach, the Second Restatement  effectively calls on the courts to engage \nin imaginative reconstruction, and we have already discussed the objections to this \napproach by textualists and modern -day purposivists alike. For questions left \nunaddressed by the legislature, it is impossible fo r a court to say how the legislature \nwould have weighe d and valued all of the relevant considerations outlined in the \nSecond Restatement . The legislature\u2019s all -things -considered approach to enacting \nstatutes could produce any number of possible outcomes. Without evidence as to \nhow the legislature would have resolved the issue \u2014and recall again that we are \nassuming that the legislature passe d the statute without giving thought to its multi -\nstate applicability \u2014it is impossible to predict how a reasonable legislature acting \nreasonably would have resolved it. Add t o this the well -founded doubts that \nlegislatures act reasonably, and we are left with the unfortunate but inescapable \nconclusion that the courts\u2019 attempt to reconstruct how the legislature would have \naddressed the issue of multi -state applicability , had it considered the matter , amounts \nto little more than conjecture. The conclusions reached by a court may well turn out \n \nBaxter\u2019s teachings and adopted an approach that resembles the Second Restatement  insofar \nas it seeks an \u201caccommodation of conflicting state policies\u201d  and tries to \u201callocate[] domains \nof lawmaking power in multi -state contexts.\u201d Harrah\u2019s Club , 546 P.2d at 723\u201324 (quoting \nHarold W.

But whether the court\u2019s ultimate conclusions are those the \nlegislature would have reached is unknowable.  \nEven if a court does fortuitously arrive at the same conclusion that the \nlegislature would have reached on the specific facts of the case, there is another \nproblem. Legislatures typically legislate for categories of cases, not for specific \nfactual situatio ns. As we have seen, however, Currie\u2019s approach to the multi -state \nissue is highly context -specific . It requires consideration of the domiciles of the \nspecific parties involved in the dispute and the location of the specific conduct (and \nthe effects of the  conduct) underlying the dispute.222 Even to specify the purpose of \nthe contending laws, as we have seen, the court has to consider the laws in \ncomparison with the laws of the other states having connections to the dispute.223 \nThe Second Restatement  approach is, if anything, even more context -specific. Thus, \nwhile a legislature typically balances various domestic interests in order to establish \na general rule or standard for courts to apply across a range of cases, Currie\u2019s \napproach and that of the Second Restatement  require courts to operate on the \nimplausible assumption that legislatures legislate for particular cases.  \nBy excluding consideration of multilateral  concerns, Currie\u2019s original \nproposal was more administrable by courts than some of the second -generation \napproaches to interest analysis and probably produced a greater degree of certainty \nand predictability. But in doing so, it sacrificed its claim to re flect the likely \npreferences of the legislature. The Second Restatement , consistent with its all -\nthings -considered approach, advises courts to take into account the need for \ncertainty and predictability as well as the needs of the interstate and international \nsystem (including judicial administrability). In taking these factors into account, a \ncourt could well decide that a more determinate general rule is preferable \u2014but it \ncannot claim with confidence that the legi slature would prefer a general rule or a \ncase-specific , indeterminate , all-things -considered analysis.  \n* * *  \nIn this Part, we have drawn on the modern critique of purposivism to show \nthat governmental interest analysis cannot claim to yield conclusions regarding a \nlaw\u2019s multi -state applicability that reliably reflect the legislature\u2019s preferences on \nthat question . We began with the usual challenges of identifying the legislature\u2019s \nsubstantive purposes in enacting a law \u2014its purposes in the purely internal case. \nThese difficulties can perhaps be overcome in a given case, but the task is rife with \npitfalls, and court s are as likely to err as to get it right.224 If a court accurately \nidentifies the purposes behind a law, interest analysis assumes that the legislature\u2019s \npreferences regarding the law\u2019s multi -state applicability can be inferred from its \nsubstantive purposes. But with respect to the type of law that inter ests us, we assume \nthat the legislature enacted the law with the purely internal case in mind, giving no \nthought to the question of multi -state scope. As we have shown, the legislature\u2019s \npurposes in the purely internal case are consistent with any number o f possible \n \n 222. See supra Section III.B.  \n 223. See supra  text accompanying note  191. \n 224. See supra Section III.A.  \n2025] GOVERNMENTAL INTEREST ANALYSIS  429 \nlegislative preferences on the question of multi -state applicability . As a prediction \nof the legislature\u2019s likely preferences, i nterest analysis is thus not superior to other \npossible approaches to interpreting a law as to its multi -state applicability.225 \nTo be clear, we do not maintain that the modern critique of purposivism \nrules out any particular approach  to choice of law. Even if we understand the \nquestion as one of interpreting forum law as to its multi -state applicability (and we \ndo not question this view), a state is as free to adopt the case -specific , all-things -\nconsidered approach of the Second Restatement  as the traditional jurisdiction -\nselecting approach of the First Restatement . It is even free to adopt a Currie -style \ninterest analysis or Baxter\u2019s comparative -impairment approach. Our point is that \nnone of these approaches can claim the upper hand as being more faithful to \nlegislative preferences, as Currie purported to do. Whichever approach is adopted \nmust be defended on other grounds.  \nOne relevant consideration in selecting a choice -of-law approach will be \nthe need to avoid undue friction with other states having different policies while not \nunduly sacrificing the advancement of the substantive policies reflected in the \nforum\u2019s law. Thi s balance could be struck on a case -by-case basis, such as through \na Second Restatement -type approach. But another relevant consideration will be the \nneed for certainty and predictability, which would cut in favor of a broader rule, one \nthat will inevitabl y either over -protect the need to avoid friction with other states \nand under -protect the advancement of the forum\u2019s substantive policies or vice versa.  \nViews about the appropriateness of judicial policymaking will also affect \nthe choice of approach. Since the outcome of a court\u2019s application of a Second \nRestatement -type analysis cannot be attributed in any meaningful sense to the \nlegislature, an aversion to judicial policymaking might lead a court to adopt a \nbroader presumption of some sort (such as the jurisdiction -selecting rules of the \nFirst Restatement , or the presumption against extraterritoriality discussed below). \nOf course, the court\u2019s adoption of such a presumption would itself be an act of \njudicial policymaking, which requires justification. One potential justification is that \nsuch a rule creates a stable background against which Congress may act with \npredictable effects, thus maximizing the likel ihood that over time the outcomes will \napproximate those anticipated by the lawmaker. Of course, if the legislature does \nenact laws with background rules of interpretation in mind, faithfulness to legislative \npreferences might suggest keeping in place the currently existing  rules, which today \nwould favor retention of the Second Restatement  approach in about half of the states. \nBut the benefits of the existing rules would have to be balanced against their costs, \nincluding the difficulty of applying them and the randomness of the outcomes they \nproduce. Working through these factors and develo ping the best approach to choice \nof law is well beyond the scope of this Article. Our point is simply that as the modern \ncritique of purposivism in statutory interpretatio n has taught us, governmental \ninterest analysis cannot be said to be  superior to the other  approaches  from the \n \n 225. See supra Section III.B.  \n430 ARIZONA LAW REVIEW  [VOL. 67: 391 \nperspective of capturing legislative preferences with respect to mu lti-state \napplicability.226 \nIV. THE RISE OF INTERPRETIVE PRESUMPTIONS IN FEDERAL AND \nSTATE COURTS  \nThe insights of the modern critique of purposivism in statutory \ninterpretation have prompted divergent reactions in state and federal courts. The \nfederal courts, led by the U.S. Supreme Court, have adopted a presumption against \nextraterritoriality, which i nterprets federal statutes to not apply beyond our borders  \nunless the statutory text (or possibly other evidence of legislative intent) clearly \nreflects a contrary legislative intent. In theory, at least, this presumption appears to \nintegrate the Court\u2019s g eneral approach to statutory interpretation with its approach \nto choice of law. The states, meanwhile, have developed diverse approaches: some \nhave adopt ed a similar presumption ; others have  not; and few rationalize their \napproach to statutes and the common law. While the federal courts have expressly \nrejected Currie\u2019s teachings  in determining the multi -state applicability of federal \nstatutes , the state courts have been much slower to do so.  \nThis narrative masks some complexity. As we discuss below, the federal \npresumption against extraterritoriality  in practice  ends up reproducing elements of \nthe purposive analysis that it facially rejects. Even so, it is a far more constrained \npurposive inquiry, much closer to the modern purposivism we previously \ndiscussed227 than to an unbounded imaginative reconstruction of legislative intent. \nThus, even as some form of purposivism may well endure in federal choice of law, \nit differs radically from the version Currie espoused. Section IV.A discusses the \nCourt\u2019s adoption and implementation of a presumption against extraterritoriality, \nand Section IV.B discusses the state courts\u2019 response to the statutory interpretation \nrevolution.  \nA. The Federal Presumption Against Extraterritoriality  \nThe revolution in statutory interpretation described in Part II was led by the \nU.S. Supreme Court, with Justice Scalia taking a leading role. This revolution has \nhad a decided impact on the Court\u2019s approach to determining the multi -state \napplicability of f ederal statutes. The Court\u2019s adoption of the presumption against \nextraterritoriality was a classic textualist move, eschewing an inquiry into legislative \nintent in favor of a clear -cut, widely applicable rule of construction.228 The \n \n 226. Indeed, we doubt that governmental interest analysis can even reliably identify \nfalse conflicts \u2014that is, cases in which no purpose of a given state\u2019s law would be advanced \nif applied in the case. As discussed in Section III.A, if a legislature\u2019s enactment of a given \nlaw reflects its views that a  rule is more just, it may prefer that the rule be applied to all cases, \nno matter how unconnected to the forum.  \n 227. See supra Section II.C.  \n 228. See ANTONIN SCALIA & BRYAN A.

Whether the canons of construction constrain judicial \ndecision -making  is, of course, hotly debated. See, e.g. , WILLIAM N. ESKRIDGE , JR., \n \n2025] GOVERNMENTAL INTEREST ANALYSIS  431 \ndifficulties the Court has encountered in giving content to the presumption, however, \nillustrate the challenges of discarding all reference to legislative purpose.  \nThe Supreme Court\u2019s cases about the extraterritorial applicability of federal \nstatutes address the same issue that state courts are confronted with in choice -of-law \ncases: the multi -state applicability229 of forum (in this case, federal) law.230 This \nSection will focus on the Court\u2019s adoption and application of the presumption \nagainst extraterritoriality, which is its current approach to this question. But first , we \nwill briefly describe the Court\u2019s earlier practices, showing how its approaches to this \nquestion have generally followed developments in choice -of-law doctrine over the \nyears.  \n1. Extraterritoriality and Choice of Law  \nInitially, the U.S. Supreme Court applied something like the traditional \napproach to choice of law in construing federal statutes as to their multi -state \napplicability: in the absence of evidence of a contrary congressional intent, the Court \nconstrued statutes to apply only to the extent the forum\u2019s law would be applicable \nunder traditional choice -of-law rules. Thus, in reviewing the foreign applicability of \nthe Sherman Act, the Court wrote in American Banana  Co. v. United Fruit Co.  that \n\u201c[w]ords having uni versal scope, such as \u2018every contract in restraint of trade,\u2019 \u2018every \nperson who shall monopolize,\u2019 etc., will be taken, as a matter of course, to mean \nonly everyone subject to such legislation, not all that the legislator subsequently may \nbe able to catch. \u201d231 The Court looked to choice -of-law cases to determine who was \nproperly \u201csubject to such legislation,\u201d noting that \u201cthe general and almost universal \nrule is that the character of an act as lawful or unlawful must be determined wholly \nby the law of the count ry where the act is done.\u201d232 Accordingly, the Court held that \nthe Sherman Act applied only if the challenged conduct occurred in the United \nStates.233 \nAs choice -of-law rules developed, so did the Court\u2019s approach to the \nextraterritoriality issue. In the antitrust context, the Court replaced the strict \nterritorial approach of American Banana  with something closer to Currie\u2019s interest \nanalysis. In the Alcoa  case, the Second Circuit, sitting as a court of last resort because \nthe Supreme Court lacked a quorum, reiterated that \u201cwe are not to read general \nwords, such as those in [the Sherman] Act, without regard to the limitations \ncustomarily observed by nation s upon the exercise of their powers; limitations which \n \nINTERPRETING LAW: A PRIMER ON HOW TO READ STATUTES AND THE CONSTITUTION  16\u201319 \n(2016). For present purposes, it suffices to note that such presumptions are driven by the \ntextualist critique of purposivism and imaginative reconstruction, as Justice Scalia \u2019s opinion \nin Morrison  makes clear. See infra notes 257\u201358 and accompanying text.  \n 229.

Although \nAlcoa  was not a Supreme Court decision, it was quickly endorsed by the Court.236 \nReflecting further developments in the conflict of laws, the Ninth Circuit, \nin Timberlane  Lumber Co. v.  Bank of America , developed the once -influential \n\u201cjurisdictional rule of reason.\u201d237 Citing the Second Restatement , the court adopted \na multilateral  test for ascertaining the multi -state reach of the Sherman Act, \ninstructing courts to consider not just the existence of an effect on U.S. commerce \nbut also \u201cwhether the interests of, and links to, the United States \u2014including the \nmagnitude of the effect o n American foreign commerce \u2014are sufficiently strong, \nvis-\u00e0-vis those of other nations, to justify an assertion of extraterritorial \nauthority.\u201d238 This multilateral  approach to extraterritoriality recalled the approach \nadopted by Justice Jackson to determine the multi -state scope of the Jones Act,239 \nwhich , as later described by Justice Frankfurter, reflected \u201cdue recognition of our \nself-regarding respect for the interests of foreign nations,\u201d with \u201cthe controlling \nconsideration [being] the interacting interests of the United States and foreign \ncountries.\u201d240 \nAs these decisions show, even if the multi -state applicability of a statute is \nunderstood as a question of statutory interpretation, it can, in principle, be assessed \neither through a substantive statutory presumption, a unilateral interest analysis, or \na multilateral  interest analysis. Indeed, in Hartford Fire Insurance Co. v. California , \nthe Court\u2019s strongest textualist justice endorsed a version of Timberlane \u2019s \nmultilateral  approach to extraterritorial application of the Sherman Act , even  while \nemphasizi ng that the question before the Court was one of statutory interpretation.241 \nJustice Scalia dissent ed in Hartford Fire \u2014the majority\u2019s mangled analysis having \nbeen based on a misreading of the relevant Restatement  provision.242 In F.

Nor did it suggest that any \nparticular approach was required or precluded by the need to be faithful to \nCongress\u2019 s preferences. The choice was for the Court to make, and in later cases the \nCourt adopted the presumption against extraterritoriality as its general approach to \ndetermining the multi -state applicability of federal statutes (while grandfathering \nout the ant itrust laws).  \n2. The Presumption Against Extraterritoriality\u2019s Textualism  \nWith the advent of textualism, the Court reverted to something like Justice \nHolmes\u2019s original approach in American Banana . In EEOC v. Arab American Oil \nCo. (\u201cAramco \u201d), the Court applied the presumption against extraterritoriality to \ndetermine the multi -state applicability of federal anti -discrimination laws as if \nnothing had changed since American Banana .244 Like the traditional approach, and \nlike interest analysis, the presumption against extraterritoriality is a rule for \ninterpreting statutes as to their multi -state applicability. Insofar as it tells courts how \nto apply a statute in the multi -state context where the legislature has not addressed \nthe issue, the presumption against extraterritoriality operates precisely as traditional \nchoice -of-law rules were understood to operate in the Carroll  case, and as Currie \nunderstood interest analysis to work \u2014i.e., as a way to interpret the multi -state \napplicability of statutes in the face of legislative silence.  \nAs with state statutes, there will frequently be text in federal statutes that \nwill bear upon the statute\u2019s multi -state applicability. Just as some state statutes will \npurport to apply to \u201cany person,\u201d federal statutes will often be broadly phrased as to \ntheir applicability. Indeed, federal statutes will often have language that bears even \nmore relevance to the question of multi -state applicability. The Sherman Act, for \nexample, purports to apply to \u201c [e]very  contract [or] conspiracy, in restraint of \ntrade  or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations .\u201d245 As \ndiscussed above, courts routinely disregard statutory text that purports to extend a \nstatute to \u201cany person,\u201d presuming that the legislature passed the statute with only \nthe purely domestic case in mind.  \nFor the same reason, in applying the presumption against extraterritoriality, \nthe Court disregards statutory text providing that the statute applies to cases that \naffect \u201cinterstate or foreign commerce,\u201d presuming that this language was adopted \nto address Congress\u2019s constitutional authority to legislate over the subject matter.246 \nThe Court has thus held that language of this sort, and other \u201cboilerplate\u201d language, \nis insufficient to rebut the presumption against extraterritoriality.247 As is true with \nchoice of law generally, the Court has explained that it \u201cpresume[s] [Congress] \u2018is \n \n 244. 499 U.S. 244, 248, 259 (1991) , superseded by statute , Civil Rights Act of \n1991, Pub.

For a recent argument that this language is actually strongly \nreflective of Congress \u2019s intent regarding the multi -state applicability of the Sherman Act, see \ngenerally  Herbert Hovenkamp, The Antitrust Text , 99 IND. L.J. 1063 (202 4). \n 246. See Aramco , 499 U.S. at 248 \u201351. \n 247.

In the context of the presumption against extraterritoriality, \nthis assumption does heavier lifting \u2014it serves to justify the Court\u2019s conclusion that \nthe statute does not apply beyond our borders.249 \nIn sum, like other approaches to choice of law, the presumption against \nextraterritoriality restricts the multi -state applicability of federal statutes not just in \nthe absence of text, but in the face of text  suggesting the contrary . In this respect, it \nis a strong -form substantive canon, designed primarily to protect the extra -textual \ninterest in guarding against \u201cunintended clashes between our laws and those of other \nnations which could result in inter national discord.\u201d250 Scholars and judges have \ndebated whether substantive canons are consistent with the tenets of textualism. For \nexample, Justice Barrett has asserted, in both her judicial and scholarly writings, that \nstrong -form substantive canons \u201care \u2018in significant tension with textualism\u2019 insofar \nas they instruct a court to adopt something other than the statute\u2019s most natural \nmeaning.\u201d251 On the other hand, Barrett recognizes that a statute\u2019s text must be read \nin context; that \u201ccontext includes common sense;\u201d and that , from the perspective of \ncommon sense, \u201cliteralism \u2014the antithesis of context -driven interpretation \u2014falls \nshort.\u201d252 Justice Barrett\u2019s argument that such canons can be understood as based on \ncontextual or \u201ccommon -sense\u201d readings of the text is echoed in the cases on the \npresumption against extraterritoriality, where the Court has described the \npresumption as based in pa rt on the \u201ccommonsense notion that Congress generally \nlegislates with domestic concerns in mind.\u201d253 Although some scholars have claimed \nthat this approach to substantive canons is actually a form of purposivism,254 we \nview the presumption as aligned with the commitments of textualists to the extent it \ndisavows an open -ended search for legislative purpose and seeks the simplification \nof the judicial task and a measure of certainty and predictability in judicial outco mes. \nAs we will see in the next S ubsection, however, the Court\u2019s application of the \npresumption against extraterritoriality  has not completely banished all reference to \nlegislative purposes.  \n \n 248.

The Presumption Against Extraterritoriality\u2019s Purposivism  \nThe Court has expressly contrasted the presumption against \nextraterritoriality with Currie\u2019s purposivist approach. In Morrison v. National \nAustralia Bank ,255 Justice Scalia\u2019s description of the lower courts\u2019 then -prevailing \napproach to determining the multi -state applicability of \u00a7 10(b) of the Securities \nExchange Act reads like a direct rebuke of Currie and of imaginative reconstruction \nin general:  \nCommentators have criticized the unpredictable and inconsistent \napplication of \u00a7  10(b) to transnational cases.  . . . The criticisms seem \nto us justified. The results of judicial -speculation -made -law\u2014\ndivining what Congress would have wanted if it had thought of the \nsituation before the court \u2014demonstrate the wisdom of the \npresumption aga inst extraterritoriality.256 \nAs we shall see, however, the Court\u2019s approach is, in application, less distinct from \nCurrie\u2019s than Justice Scalia\u2019s quip suggests \u2014largely because of Justice Scalia\u2019s own \nadoption, in the same case, of a \u201cfocus\u201d test to determine the multi -state applicability \nof a statute in the face of insufficient legislative guidance on the question.  \nThe Court adopted the presumption against extraterritoriality  as a \n\u201cprinciple of interpretation\u201d that \u201cpreserv[es] a stable background against which \nCongress can legislate with predictable effects.\u201d257 As the Court described it, the \npresumption tells us that \u201c[w]hen a statute gives no clear indication of an \nextraterritorial application, it has none.\u201d258 But\u2014as befits an ancient topic of \njurisprudence \u2014the question of multi -state applicability resists such easy \ndomestication. The Court\u2019s statement in Morrison  would be true if in the absence of \ncongressional guidance on the question of multi -state scope, the Court interpreted \nstatutes to apply only to cases having no connections to other countries. But such a \nrule would impose presumptive limits on the multi -state applicability of federal \nstatutes that would be intolerable in today\u2019s globally integrated economy. While \nmaintaining that in the face of congressional sile nce, federal statutes lack all \nextraterritorial force, the Court\u2019s clarification of the distinction between an \nextraterritorial application of a statute and a domestic application makes it clear that \n\u201cnon -extraterritorial\u201d statutes do apply to some multi -state cases.  \nMorrison  involved a claim under \u00a7 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of \n1934. The defendant had engaged in certain acts of fraud in the United States in \nconnection with the sale of securities outside the United States.259 The Court \nconcluded that the statutory language did not evince clearly enough a legislative \nintent to reach foreign securities fraud.260 The statute was therefore applicable only \ndomestically. But  because some of the fraud on which the suit was based took place \nin the United States, the Court had to address whether the case before it presented a \ndomestic application of the statute. Notably, the Court did not entertain the \n \n 255. 561 U.S. 247 (2010).  \n 256. Id. at 260 \u201361. \n 257. Id. at 255 , 261 . \n 258. Id. at 255.  \n 259. See i d. at 251 \u201352. \n 260.

If it had, the Court could have ruled against the plaintiffs \nbecause some  of the relevant conduct had occurred outside the United States. The \nCourt did not even discuss this possibility.261 \nInstead, the Court held that where the case involves some foreign and some \ndomestic connections, the case presents a domestic application of the statute if \nwhatever was the \u201cfocus\u201d of Congress\u2019s concern occurred in the United States.262 In \nenacting the  Securities  Exchange Act, the Court held that the focus of Congress\u2019s \nconcern was \u201cpur chases and sales of securities.\u201d263 Therefore, the Court concluded  \nthat \u201cit is . . . only transactions in securities listed on domestic exchanges, and \ndomestic transactions in other securities, to which \u00a7  10(b) applies.\u201d264 Because \nCongress\u2019s focus in enacting the Act was not the prevention of fraud, the fact that \nsome of the fraud had taken place in the United States did not mean that the case \nbefore it was a domestic application of the statute.  \nIt is clear from the Court\u2019s analysis that the adjectives \u201cdomestic\u201d and \n\u201cextraterritorial\u201d are terms of art, not descriptive terms. A case might present an \n\u201cextraterritorial\u201d application of the statute even if it has some connections to the \nUnited States,  such as fraudulent acts that occurred in the United States. More \nimportantly, a case can present a \u201cdomestic\u201d application of the Act even if it has \nsome connections to other countries, such as fraudulent acts in other countries in \nconnection with the sale  of a security in the United States. The Court\u2019s analysis \nmakes clear that the latter case is a \u201cdomestic\u201d case falling within the scope of the \nSecurities Exchange Act. The terms \u201cextraterritorial\u201d and \u201cdomestic\u201d thus turn out \nto lack any inherent content. Instead, they are given content by the Court\u2019s \napplication of the \u201cfocus\u201d test, which labels as a \u201cdomestic application\u201d any case \nwhere the law may be permissibly applied.  \nThe Supreme Court\u2019s concept of \u201cfocus\u201d therefore reflects its approach to \nthe question we have been discussing throughout this Article: how to determine a \nlaw\u2019s multi -state applicability in the face of legislative silence on that question. The \nfirst step of the analysis (examining whether there is sufficient evidence of \nlegislative intent to rebut the presumption  against extraterritoriality ) is analogous to \nthe courts\u2019 resolution of the choice -of-law question when the legislature has \nincluded an external sc ope provision in the statute. The second step (the \u201cfocus\u201d \ninquiry) addresses the more difficult question \u2014which arises more frequently \u2014of \nhow the courts are to answer the question in the absence of legislative guidance.265 \n \n 261. Cf. Kiobel  v. Royal Dutch Petroleum Co. , 569 U.S. 108, 12 6\u201327 (2013)  (Alito, \nJ., concurring) ( stating that a dispute presents a domestic application of the federal common \nlaw cause of action implied from the Alien Tort Statute for violations of international law \nonly if conduct in the United States \u201cis sufficient to violate an international law norm \u201d). \n 262.

Since the courts reach the focus issue only if the legislature has provided \ninsufficient guidance on the question of multi -state scope, it would seem that the \u201cfocus \u201d of \nthe statute, in this context, has to be its focus in the purely domestic case, just as a law \u2019s \n \n2025] GOVERNMENTAL INTEREST ANALYSIS  437 \nBut the Supreme Court\u2019s concept of \u201cfocus\u201d was undertheorized, to say the \nleast. In holding that the statute\u2019s focus was the sale of securities rather than \ncombatting fraud, the Court in Morrison  reasoned that \u201c [s]ection 10(b) does not \npunish deceptive conduct, but only deceptive conduct \u2018in connection with the \npurchase and sale of any security registered on a national securities exchange or any \nsecurity not so registered.\u2019\u201d266 It is equally true , however,  that the statute does not \npenalize all purchases or sales of securities, but only purchases or sales of securities \ninvolving deceptive conduct.267 It is unclear why the statute\u2019s focus was one of the \nconditions the statute establishes for liability but not the other.  \nOther parts of the Court\u2019s analysis in Morrison  seem to associate a statute\u2019s \n\u201cfocus\u201d with its purpose. For example, the Court noted that \u201cpurchase -and-sale \ntransactions are the objects of the statute\u2019s solicitude,\u201d and that \u201cit is parties or \nprospective parties to those transactions that the statute s eeks to \u2018protect.\u2019\u201d268 The \ndifference between the statute\u2019s \u201cobject of  . . . solicitude\u201d and its purpose is elusive. \nThe identification of the \u201cparties\u201d the statute \u201cseeks to protect\u201d seems like an inquiry \ninto the statute\u2019s purpose. Indeed, the identification of the class of p ersons the statute \nseeks to protect calls to mind Currie\u2019s approach to identifying statutory purpose, as \ndiscussed in Part III.  \nSubsequent decisions also suggest that the Court understands a statute\u2019s \n\u201cfocus\u201d as its purpose. In WesternGeco LLC v.

Understanding \u201cfocus\u201d \nas \u201cpurpose\u201d also leaves the Court\u2019s test for determining the multi -state scope of \nfederal statutes vulnerable to one of the key textualist criticisms of purposivism: that \nstatutes do not have a unitary purpose. The Supreme Court\u2019s \u201cfocus \u201d test appears to \nrequire the lower courts to identify a single focus. The purpose of the Securities \nExchange Act was in part to regulate sales of securities, but it was also in part to \nregulate deceptive conduct.273 The Supreme Court chose the former as the statute\u2019s \nfocus without really explaining why the other was not. Yet the Court also failed to \nprovide a convincing alternative understanding of the concept of \u201cfocus\u201d that would \nclarify why one but not the other was the statut e\u2019s focus.  \nFinally, a purposive analysis also risks undermining the presumption\u2019s goal \nof providing a clear rule against which Congress can legislate with predictable \neffects. As we have seen, Currie -style purposivism can be highly indeterminate.274 \nThis was, indeed, Justice Alito\u2019s criticism of the majority\u2019s recent holding in \nYegiazaryan v. Smagin .275 In RJR Nabisco v. European Community , the Court had \nheld (dubiously276) that because of the presumption against extraterritoriality, the \nRacketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (\u201c RICO \u201d) authorizes private \nrecovery only for domestic injuries.277 In Smagin , the majority held that determining \nwhether an injury was domestic or foreign involved a \u201ccontextual  . . . inquiry\u201d and \nnoted that \u201cno set of factors can capture the relevant considerations for all cases.\u201d278 \nJustice Alito noted in dissent that the Court had, in prior cases, \u201cplaced a premium \non workability in our extraterritorial -application cases.\u201d279 He criticized the Smagin  \nmajority\u2019s highly \u201cnuanced\u201d approach, quoting Justice Scalia\u2019s criticism of the \napproach the Court had rejected in Morrison : \u201cThere is no more damning indictment \nof the [Second Circuit\u2019s] \u2018conduct\u2019 and \u2018effects\u2019 tests than the Second Circuit\u2019s own \ndeclaration that \u2018the presence or absence of any single factor which was considered \nsignificant in other cases  . . . is not necessa rily dispositive in future cases.\u2019\u201d280 \nJust a week later, in Abitron Austria GmbH v.

Justice Sotomayor, relying heavily on \nWesternGeco \u2019s language equating a statute\u2019s \u201cfocus\u201d with its \u201cend,\u201d reasoned that \nthe Lanham Act\u2019s end is \u201cprotecting consumers from confusion \u201d and would have \nheld that application of the Act would be \u201cdomestic\u201d if the likely confusion would \noccur in the United States .283 Because the courts below did not apply that test, she \nwould have vacated and remanded for its application in the first instance.284 But this \ntime it was Justice Sotomayor who was in the m inority. The majority, in an opinion \nby Justice Alito, significantly revised the Court\u2019s approach to determining when a \ncase involves a domestic application of a statute.  \nThe majority quoted and purported to accept WesternGeco \u2019s statement that \n\u201c[t]he focus of a statute is \u2018the object of its solicitude,\u2019 which can include the conduct \nit \u2018seeks to \u201cregulate,\u201d \u2019 as well as the parties and interests it \u2018seeks to \u201cprotect\u201d \u2019 or \nvindicate.\u201d285 But the Court held that a statute\u2019s \u201cfocus\u201d is only sometimes  \ndeterminative of whether a case involves a domestic application of the statute. \nQuoting language from some  prior cases, the Court held that what matters is the \n\u201cconduct relevant to the focus\u201d of the statute.286 The Court read this language as \nrequiring that the thing that has to occur in the United States for a case to involve a \ndomestic application of the statute is always conduct.287 In other words, even if the \nstatute\u2019s focus is \u201cpersons\u201d or \u201cinterests,\u201d as contemplated by WesternGeco , and \nthose persons or interests are in the United States, the case does not involve a \ndomestic application of the statute if the case did not involve any conduct  in the \nUnited States. Similarly, even if the effect  of the conduct is in the United States, as \nit admittedly was in Abitron  (because the confusion resulting from the infringement \nwould occur in the United States), the statute does not involve a domestic application \nof the statute if no conduct occurred in the United States.  \nAbitron  appears to significantly rewrite the case  law on when a case \ninvolves a domestic application of a statute. The holding is in substantial tension \nwith Justice Alito\u2019s own opinion for the Court in RJR Nabisco , where the Court held \nthat RICO involved a domestic application of the statute when the injury  occurred \nin the United States, regardless of where the conduct causing the injury occurred.288 \nWhile in earlier decisions the Court had stressed the importance of the \u201cfocus\u201d of \nthe statute in determining when a case involves a domestic application of a statute, \nit now appears that \u201cfocus\u201d is relevant in only some cases \u2014namely, cases that \ninvolve s ome conduct in the United States and some conduct outside the United \nStates (as in Morrison ). When the case involves conduct outside the United States \nand a connection to the United States other than conduct (such as the domicile of a \n \n 282. See id.  \n 283.

The quick succession of these two decisions suggests \nthat the Court has not fully worked out its approach to extraterritoriality. The Abitron  \napproach, if followed in later cases, would reduce the range of cases where  there \nmight be a need to identify the statute\u2019s purposes. (Within this range of cases, \nhowever, the uncertainties of determining the operative  purpose remain.) The \nCourt\u2019s emphasis on the  place of the conduct, irrespective of purpose, adds to the \npredictability of the test and strengthens the presumption\u2019s status as a strong -form \nsubstantive canon. At least to the extent the case involves no conduct in the United \nStates, the applicability of the statute would apparently not depend on the nature of \nthe substantive obligations the statute imposes.  \nHowever, by insisting that th e relevant connection be the conduct  that the \nsuit is based  on, the Court may have selected the wrong category of domestic \nconnection. The traditional choice -of-law rule for torts focused on the place of injury \nrather than the place of conduct.289 And the Court\u2019s rule may be too blunt \u2014\ntraditional choice -of-law rules calibrated the required type of connection with the \nforum to the type of statute involved (place of injury for statutes sounding in tort; \nsitus for statutes involving property; domicile  for statutes involving questions of \npersonal status). In future cases, the Court may well develop the law in that direction. \nIf so, it will have stumbled onto an approach to the question of multi -state \napplicability that mirrors the approach that prevaile d in the states before the advent \nof interest analysis, which in turn would mark a dramatic reversal from the \npurposivism it once embraced in this area. On the other hand, if the Court adheres \nto this \u201cconduct\u201d test, it will have adopted a strong -form subs tantive canon that \nsignificantly overprotects the interest in avoiding conflict with other nations.  \nEven if Abitron  turns out to be a one -off, and the approach of Morrison  and \nWesternGeco  continues to prevail, the Court\u2019s adoption of the presumption against \nextraterritoriality  would reflect a significant departure from an approach like \nCurrie\u2019s \u2014and from the pre -Morrison  approach to construing securities laws as to \ntheir multi -state applicability. Even though the pre -Abitron  cases on \u201cfocus\u201d \ndetermine whether a case is domestic or extraterritorial by reference to a concept \nthat might be understood as its p urpose, they apparently contemplate the \nidentification of a statute\u2019s purpose at a very high level of generality. Thus, Justice \nSotomayor described the \u201cend\u201d of the Lanham  Act as the avoidance of confusion.290 \nRather than licensing courts to imagine how broadly the legislature would have \nwanted the statute to be applied, the courts merely ask whether the contact identified \nby reference to the statute\u2019s generalized purpose took place within the United States . \nThe approach bears scant resemblance to the imaginative reconstruction that Currie \ncalled for and that Scalia ridiculed.

The Diversity of State Approaches  \nWhile the U.S. Supreme Court seems to have brought its approach to \nchoice of law increasingly in line with its textualist approach to statutory \ninterpretation, the states have only fitfully \u2014and inconsistently \u2014followed its lead. \nEven as some states have been more willing to follow the Court\u2019s lead in rejecting \nthe free -form purposivism of the mid -century, many have insulated their choice -of-\nlaw approaches from that transformation.  \nMost states seem to follow some version of Currie\u2019s interest analysis in \nresolving choice -of-law problems. In the most recent survey of the choice -of-law \nmethodologies used in the 51 jurisdictions of the United States, well over half of the \nstates use either interest analysis, the Second Restatement , or some combination of \nthe two to resolve choice -of-law problems in tort and contracts.291 As mentioned \npreviously, the Second Restatement  was influenced by Currie\u2019s work. It generally \nselects the law of the state having the most significant relationship to the issue, as \nmeasured by factors including the \u201crelevant policies of the forum\u201d and the \u201cthe \nrelevant policies of other interested stat es and the relative interests of those states in \nthe determination of the particular issue.\u201d292 Commentary on those factors reveals \nthat a deeply purposive approach is envisioned to ascertain what \u201cpolicies\u201d and \n\u201cinterests\u201d are at play.293 \nSuch old -school purposivist approaches to choice of law are in vogue even \nin states that have otherwise adopted textualist methods of statutory interpretation. \nTake Texas. A 1984 Texas case adopted the Second Restatement \u2019s approach with a \ndistinct interest -analysis flavor,294 an approach that persists to this day.295 But both \nof Texas\u2019s high courts (the Court of Criminal Appeals and the Supreme Court of \nTexas ) have adopted a modified form of textualism as the basic method of statutory \ninterpretation, even in the face of a legislative directive to more readily consider \nextrinsic sources of statutory meaning.296 No effort seems to have been made to \nexplain the discrepancy between Texas\u2019s general approach to statutory \ninterpretation and its choice -of-law methodology.  \nYet that observation does not tell the full story. Currently, as William S. \nDodge has demonstrated, at least 22 states have adopted presumptions against \nextraterritoriality when construing their own statutes.297 Such presumptions would \nseem to cut against the dominance of Currie -influenced approaches to choice of law, \nas they operate as (ostensibly) clear interpretive rules that can often determine the \nchoice -of-law question without resort to considering state pu rposes or interests.

Texas, for instance, has adopted a presumption against \nextraterritoriality.298 Thus, when it comes to statutes at least, Texas would seem to \nadopt a consistent methodological line, avoiding boundless inquiries into state \ninterests or purposes.  \nUnlike the federal courts, however, no state court appears to have applied \nthis presumption to common -law claims.299 When it comes to common -law claims, \ncourts may choose to engage in a state -interest or purpose -driven inquiry in order to \ndetermine extraterritorial application. (Texas, again, would be a ready example.) \nThere may be good reasons to separate the treatment  of statutes and the common  \nlaw in this way.300 But both the U.S. Supreme Court and Currie envisioned the same \nregime to apply to both.301 In addition, among  the states , the presumption appears to \nbe inconsistently applied or \u2014in some cases \u2014entirely overlooked.302 And there is \nno necessary correlation between the dominant choice -of-law approach in a given \nstate and the likelihood that it has adopted a presumption against \nextra territoriality.303 The two operate independently, remaining both practically and \ntheoretically unreconciled.  \nPortraying the state landscape with regard to the adoption of Currie\u2019s \ninsights thus requires consideration of several axes. One preliminary consideration \nis whether the state conceives of the choice -of-law analysis as a two -step process: \nthe determination  of the \u201cscope\u201d of a given law, followed (if necessary) by \napplication of rules of priority.304 Another consideration is the state\u2019s dominant \napproach to choice of law \u2014which, for over half of all states, involves some \nconsideration of state interests or the purpose of a given law.305 Then there are state \npresumptions against extraterritoriality in statutory cases. Finally, operating in the \nbackground, there is the state\u2019s approach to statutory interpretation generally, as \nmeasured against a purposivism -to-textualism axis.  \nOne might expect at least some of these axes to align. For instance, one \nmight anticipate that a state with a generally textualist methodology would favor \npresumptions against extraterritoriality (in lieu of open -ended purposive inquiries) \n \n 298.

Such consistency is not to be found, however. Instead, the cases reflect a \nwide variety of approaches \u2014reflecting differing combinations of the above. The \nrejection of Curr ie-style purposivism among  the states has been at best partial. \nCurrie\u2019s interest analysis and the methodological commitments that sustain it live \non in pockets throughout the country.  \nConsider California. One of the last states continuing to use pure interest \nanalysis \u2014at least in tort306\u2014California has also adopted a presumption against \nextraterritoriality.307 The presumption turns \u201csolely on the location of the \nconduct,\u201d308 much like the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s latest ruling in Abitron . This \ncombination means that where out -of-state conduct is addressed by both common -\nlaw tort and statute, only the tort action typically may be sustained. For instance, in \nBernhard v. Harrah\u2019s Club ,309 the California Supreme Court accepted that a \nCalifornia dram -shop act could not apply extraterritorially because it was a criminal \nstatute, and such statutes generally do not apply extraterritorially.310 Yet the Court \nengaged in a lengthy analysis of the relevant state interests to determine that the \nplaintiff could still sue under an extraterritorial application of California\u2019s \nnegligence law.311 More recently, the California Supreme Court has indicated that it \nfollows the two -step process in resolving conflicts between statutory provisions: \nfirst, it determines the geographic scope of the relevant statutes, and second, if \nnecessary, it resolves c onflicts between applicable statutes through its choice -of-law \nprinciples.312 When what is at issue is the extraterritorial application of a California \nstatute, the presumption against extraterritoriality comes into play at the first step , \nand often  that is where the analysis ends.313 If the statute does apply \nextraterritorially, or if the conduct occurred in California, the analysis centers on \nstep two, where interest analysis plays the dominant role.314 The presumption \nsometimes operates to cut off interest analysis before it can get off the ground \u2014but \nonly in the specific situation where the California courts are called upon to apply a \nstate statute in a multi -state case. Otherwise, a free -form inquiry into \u201cstate interest\u201d \nrules the day.  \nSome states follow a similar model \u2014the Second Restatement  or interest \nanalysis, coupled with a presumption against extraterritoriality for statutory cases \u2014\nbut without the formality of the two -step process. For instance, Iowa courts have \nadopted a presumption against extraterritoriality.315 The Iowa Supreme Court, in \nPowell v. Khodari -Intergreen  Co., limited the presumption to statutory cases, \nholding that ordinary choice -of-law principles \u2014which, in Iowa, means the Second \nRestatement \u2014determine whether tort or contract with connections to other states \n \n 306.

Rather, it simply applied the \npresumption against extraterritoriality to preclude application of the statute while \npermitting the extraterritorial application of state tort law through evaluation of state \ninterests.317 \nConversely, Michigan couples a presumption against extraterritoriality for \nstatutes with a similarly clear -cut lex fori  approach to resolving conflicts in tort \n(though the state has adopted the approach of the Second Restatement  for \ncontracts).318 That combination produces the seeming anomaly of regularly \npermitting extraterritorial application of the state\u2019s common law while presuming \nthat its statutes are cabined within its borders.319 \nAt least 17 states have declined to adopt a presumption against \nextra territoriality at all.320 In such states, out -and-out purposive reasoning to \ndetermine the extraterritorial reach of state statutes is still used. In Burnside v. \nSimpson Paper  Co.,321 for example, the Washington Supreme Court applied the \nstate\u2019s age -discrimination statute to  the employee of a Washington company who \nresided  in California. The Court observed that \u201climiting the statute\u2019s application to \nWashington inhabitants would effectively allow Washington employers to \ndiscriminate freely against non -Washington inhabitants, thus undermining the \nfundamental purpose of the act, deterring discrimi nation.\u201d322 After quoting \nextensively from Currie, the Court examined the purposes of the relevant state \npolicies, concluding that \u201c[i]t can hardly be said that California and Washington law \nare in conflict of purpose.\u201d323 It then examined and dismissed California\u2019s interest \nin administrative resolution of age -discrimination claims.324 The Washington \nSupreme Court thus engaged in a deeply purposive exercise to justify the \nextraterritorial application of its age -discrimination statute. Notably, however, that \nCourt\u2019s general approach to statutory interpretation is to seek the \u201cplain meaning\u201d \nof the statutory terms, including \u201cthe ordinary meaning of the language at issue, the \ncontext of the statute in which that provision is found, related provisions, and the \nstatutory scheme as a whole\u201d325\u2014and not to start with an expansive consideration \nof the relevant state policies at issue.  \nOther states without a presumption against extraterritoriality evaluate both \nstatutes and common law under the same choice -of-law analysis where state \ninterests and policies play a prominent role. For instance, in Taylor v. Eastern \n \n 316. See id.  at 131 \u201332. \n 317. See id.  \n 318. See Dodge, supra note 17, at 1403 \u201304 tbl.1; Coyle et al., supra note 2 19, at 7. \n 319.

One clear lesson is that national \ndiversity in the approaches to choice of law extends in multiple directions. States \ndiffer from each other in their general approaches to statutory interpretation (despite \na clear trend to ward modified textualism), in their adoption of a presumption against \nextraterritoriality for statutes (as well as in their application of the presumption once \nadopted), and in their general choice -of-law methodology. While the U.S. Supreme \nCourt has moved  toward some version of methodological consistency \u2014adopting a \npresumption against extraterritoriality for both federal statutes and federal common \nlaw\u2014the states have not. And even as Currie\u2019s purposivist approach to statutory \ninterpretation and choice of law appears increasingly anachronistic, it limps on in \nvarious forms in most states.  \nNonetheless, that diversity should not obscure an equally important \nobservation: unbridled interest analysis is on the decline, even as Currie -style \npurposivism  lives on \u2014in some form \u2014in many states\u2019 non -statutory (and sometimes \nin their statutory) choice of law. Perhaps this is because states have implicitly \nrecognized the inconsistency between Currie\u2019s approach and their own rejection of \nthe purposivism upon which it rests.331 If so, then their rejection of purposivism  \nremains incomplete. As this Section has demonstrated, states often still weigh state \npolicies and interests in the absence of an operative statutory text, engaging in an \nanalysis that they otherwise eschew. This Currie -inspired approach endures even \nwhen states have adopted presumptio ns against extraterritoriality for their own \nstatutes.  \n \n 326. 988 N.E.2d 408 (Mass. 2013).  \n 327.

THE THIRD RESTATEMENT  AND THE FUTURE OF \nGOVERNMENTAL INTEREST ANALYSIS  \nThe ALI\u2019s current project of elaborating  a Third Restatement of Conflict of \nLaws  may accelerate the decline of Currie -style interest analysis. The draft Third \nRestatement  endorses Currie\u2019s claim that choice of law is a matter of interpreting \nthe contending laws as to their multi -state applicability, but it conspicuously \ndeclines to endorse Currie\u2019s distinctive contribution to choice of law \u2014the \npurposivist approach he broug ht to bear on the interpretive question.332 Indeed, the \napproach the draft Third Restatement  proposes to this question is decidedly non -\npurposivist.  \nAccording to the draft Third Restatement , the choice -of-law inquiry \nconsists of two steps. The first requires determining the geographic scope of the \ncontending laws; the second requires, if necessary, appl ication of  rules of priority to \ndetermine which of the potentially relevant law s should be applied. According to the \ndraft Third Restatement , only the first step is about interpreting the contending laws \nas to their multi -state reach. Section V.A of this Article discusses the draft Third \nRestatement \u2019s app roach to this step and shows that its departure from Currie\u2019s \npurposivism at this step is almost as stark as the Supreme Court\u2019s. Indeed, the draft \nThird Restatement  adopts a presumption that is similar in form, if not in content, to \nthe presumption against extraterritoriality the Supreme Court has adopted for federal \nstatutes: a presumption of extraterritoriality.  \nThe draft Third Restatement  denies that the second step of its proposed \nanalysis involves an interpretation of the relevant laws as to their multi -state reach. \nAt the second step, the courts should simply select \u201cone of several overlapping laws\u201d \nonce they have already been interpret ed to reach the facts of the case.333 In Section \nV.B, we dispute the draft Third Restatement \u2019s claim that only the first step of its \nanalysis is about interpreting the contending laws. We maintain that the second step \nis also a matter of interpretation of the substantive law. If we are correct about that, \nthen assessing the extent to which  the draft Third Restatement  departs from Currie\u2019s \npurposivism requires us to examine how it instructs courts to perform the second \nstep. We do so in Section V.C and show that step two of the draft Third \nRestatement \u2019s analysis is also distinctly \u2014though less stark ly\u2014non-purposivist in \nits orientation. Thus, if widely followed, the draft Third Restatement  will hasten  the \ndecline of governmental interest analysis.  \nA. Step One: The Draft Third Restatement \u2019s Presumption of Extraterritoriality  \nAccording to the draft Third Restatement , the choice -of-law process, by its \nnature, consists of two \u201canalytically distinct\u201d steps:  \nFirst, it must be decided which states\u2019 laws are relevant, meaning that \nthey might be used to govern a particular issue. This is typically a \nmatter of discerning the scope of the various states\u2019 internal laws, i.e., \ndeciding to which people, in which place s, and under which \n \n 332. See infra  text accompanying note 3 42. \n 333. RESTATEMENT (THIRD ) OF CONFLICT OF L. \u00a7 5.01 cmt. b  (AM. L. INST., \nTentative Draft No. 3, 2022) . \n2025] GOVERNMENTAL INTEREST ANALYSIS  447 \ncircumstances, they extend rights or obligations. Second, if states\u2019 \ninternal laws overlap and conflict, it must be decided which law shall \nbe given priority .334 \nGiving credit to Currie, the draft Third Restatement  notes that the first \nstep\u2014determining the multi -state scope of a law \u2014is an ordinary issue of \ninterpretation.335 If two or more states\u2019 laws reach the case, and the laws differ \u2014in \nthe parlance of governmental interest analysis, if the case presents a true conflict \u2014\nthe courts proceed to the second step: selecting the applicable law. This step involves \napplication of \u201crules of priority.\u201d According to the draft Third Restatement , this \nsecond step, unlike the first, is not about interpreting the contending laws as to their \nmulti -state applicability.336 Since  the draft Third Restatement  regards only the first \nstep as being a matter of interpretation of the laws in question as to their multi -state \napplicability, we begin by assessing to what extent the draft Third Restatement \u2019s \napproach to this first question carries forward the interpretive approach championed \nby Currie. The answer is: not at all.  \nThe draft Third Restatement  draws several conclusions that in its view, \nfollow from the recognition that the judicial task at this step relates to the \ndetermination of the contending laws\u2019 multi -state reach. First, the courts must look \nto the law of the state whose law is in questio n. Therefore, if a state\u2019s law has an \nexternal scope provision rendering the law inapplicable to the case, then this \nprovision is binding on all courts.337 If the law does not extend to the case \u2014for \nexample, because the external scope provision specifies that the law reaches cases \nwhere  the conduct occurred in the state and the conduct in th e case at bar did not \noccur in the state \u2014the law is not \u201crelevant\u201d and may not be applied to the case.338 \nThe same conclusion would follow if the state\u2019s courts ha d adopted a presumption \nagainst extraterritoriality , and the presumption, as developed by the enacting state\u2019s \ncourts, renders the law inapplicable to the case at hand. In this case, the law is not \nrelevant , and again the forum courts may not apply it.339 If, based on this analysis, \nonly one state\u2019s law reaches the case at hand, then there is a false conflict, and the \ncourt should apply the only law that reaches the case.340 \nSo far, the analysis is consistent with Currie\u2019s approach. But how is the \nforum to interpret the contending laws as to their multi -state applicability in the \nabsence of a statutory scope provision or an authoritative judicial holding? \nRegarding the manner of interpretation, the draft Third Restatement  appears to have \ninternalized the modern critique of purposivism. It notably declines to endorse \nCurrie\u2019s approach to interpretation, noting that \u201c[t]he precise details of Professor \nCurrie\u2019s method of interpret ation, as well as his conclusions in particular cases, are \ncomplex and contested, and this Restatement makes no attempt to describe or follow \n \n 334.

In interpreting their own laws as to their multi -\nstate reach, courts following the draft Third Restatement  are to presume that the laws \napply to all conduct within the state\u2019s territory and to all persons domiciled in the \nstate. The presumption is the opposite of the federal presumption against \nextraterritoriality in content, but it is similar to that presumpt ion in form, as it can \nbe rebutted only through a textual directive in the statute. Its applicability does not \nturn on the content of the law or the legislature\u2019s purposes in enacting it. The draft \nThird Restatement \u2019s approach thus appears to reflect the lessons of the modern \ncritique of purposivism in statutory interpretation.  \n \n 341. Id. \u00a7 5.01 cmt. b.  \n 342.

Step Two, Part One: Priority as Interpretation  \nAs noted in Part I, for Currie, forum law would always be applied when, \nproperly interpreted, the law reache s the case before the court. But the draft Third \nRestatement , like the approaches to interest analysis discussed in Section III.D, \ncontemplates a second step in the analysis in the event the step -one analysis reveals \na true conflict. If more than one state\u2019s law extends to the case, the draft Third \nRestatement  contemplates the application of \u201crules of priority\u201d to determine which  \nstate\u2019s  law is to giv e way. But the draft Third Restatement  does not regard this \ninquiry as a matter of interpreting the contending substantive laws as to their multi -\nstate applicability. In the view of the draft Third Restatement , the first step exhausts \nthe interpretive exercise. Once having determined that two or more laws reach the \ncase at hand, the second step tells the courts what law to apply, if the laws differ.348 \nAs to this step, the forum\u2019s courts always apply the forum\u2019s  \u201crules of priority.\u201d Step \ntwo is an instruction to the forum\u2019s courts about what  law is to be prioritized.349 \nWe think the second step is better understood as also a matter of \ninterpreting the forum\u2019s substantive law. Here, it is important to disentangle two \nrelated but distinct claims made by the draft Third Restatement . The first has to do \nwith its claims about whether the first and second steps are about the respective state \nlaws\u2019 external reach. The draft Third Restatement  claims that the first step concerns \nthe spatial reach of the substantive laws in question, a question governed by the law \nof the state that enacted the law.350 It follows that  if the enacting state has a \npresumption against extraterritoriality, the forum must apply that presumption, and \nif the presumption leads to the conclusion that the substantive law does not reach \nthe case, the forum court may not apply the law. On the othe r hand, the draft Third \nRestatement  claims that step two is not about the substantive laws\u2019 spatial reach, but \nabout choosing between two (or more) laws that do reach the case.351 In answering \nthis question, the forum court applies the forum\u2019s  test\u2014its own rules of priority, \nwhich (on this view) are merely instructions to the forum\u2019s  courts (and only the \nforum\u2019s courts) about when to apply another state\u2019s law.352 The draft Third \nRestatement \u2019s claim that the first step is about the laws\u2019 spatial reach while the \nsecond step is not can be questioned.353 For instance, the first step could also be seen \nas an instruction to the forum\u2019s courts about when to apply  another state\u2019s law and \nwhen not to, and the second step can also be understood as being about the spatial \nreach of the forum\u2019s law.354 For purposes of our analysis, however, we shall accept \nthe draft Third Restatement \u2019s understanding that the first step is about spatial reach , \n \n 348.

See V\u00e1zquez, supra  note 2 30, at 44\u201346. \n450 ARIZONA LAW REVIEW  [VOL. 67: 391 \nand the second step is an instruction to forum courts about when to apply a forum \nlaw that concededly reaches the case.355 \nEven if we do not regard the second step as being about the law\u2019s spatial \nreach, however, step two can and should still be understood as an interpretation of \nthe forum\u2019s substantive law on the matter in question.356 In the typical case \npresenting a true conflict, the forum will have a law on the matter and the court will \nhave determined at step one that the forum\u2019s law reaches this case. If so, then by \nwhat authority do the forum state\u2019s courts decide to resolve the case under the law \nof another state having a different content? The answer must be that forum law \ncontains an implicit permission to forum courts not to apply forum substantive law \nif, under the forum\u2019s rules of priority, the other state\u2019s law deserves priority. In other \nwords, the forum courts\u2019 authority to do so is conferred by a permission found in the \nforum\u2019s substantive law itself .357 \nThis is, indeed, the analysis the draft Third Restatement  itself implicitly \nendorses. It does so in its analysis of how external scope provisions are to be \ninterpreted. The draft Third Restatement  makes clear that in the absence of a clear \nstatement to the contrary, an external scope provision specifying that a statute \nextends to a certain category of case \u2014say, cases where the conduct occurred in the \nstate\u2014does not require  application of the law to such cases. If the conduct did occur \nwithin the state, the statute is \u201crelevant\u201d to the case,358 meaning that if another state\u2019s \nlaw is also relevant to the case, the court must go on to determine which of the two \nlaws is to be given priority. The draft Third Restatement  thus presumes that such \n \n 355. As we noted at the outset, that is why we are using the term \u201cmulti -state \napplicability \u201d rather than \u201cmulti -state reach \u201d to describe the matter in question.  See V\u00e1zquez,  \nsupra  note 5 , at 1318 . The term \u201cmulti -state applicability \u201d refers broadly to the forum \u2019s \ndecision to apply a law (or not) whether  because it does (or does not) reach the case or because \nit reaches the case but should (or should not) be given priority.  Id. at 1336 n.217.  Our analysis \nin this Article does not turn on which way of understanding the question is the right one.  \n 356. Because we are assuming arguendo  that the choice -of-law rules the courts \napply at step two are merely instructions to the forum \u2019s courts, we do not consider here how \nthe forum \u2019s courts should treat the step -two rules of other states.  If the step -two rules were \nregarded as a matter of the substantive laws \u2019 external reach , cf. supra  text accompanying note \n353\u2013354, it might be argued that the step -two rules of other states should be binding on \nforum \u2019s courts.  We do not pursue that question here.  Because we are accepting for purposes \nof analysis  the draft Third Restatement \u2019s claim that step-two rules are addressed solely to \nforum courts, we focus in this and the following Section on the step -two rules \u2019 status as \npresumptions for interpreting the forum \u2019s substantive law.  \n 357. In unusual cases, the forum \u2019s law will not reach the case , and the forum will \nhave to decide between  the laws of two other states that do reach the case. In such cases, the \nforum \u2019s rules of priority do not have to be understood as a permission found in the forum \u2019s \nsubstantive law; they can be understood instead as free -standing common law rules of the \nforum state.  See RESTATEMENT (THIRD ) OF THE CONFLICT OF L. \u00a7 5.01 cmt. c (AM. L. INST., \nTentative Draft No. 3 , 2022) . In light of the draft Third Restatement \u2019s presumption of \nextraterritoriality, however, such cases should  be rare. In cases in which the forum \u2019s \nsubstantive law does apply \u2014which is the mine run of true -conflict cases \u2014the permission not \nto apply forum law and to apply another state \u2019s law instead is best understood as being \nimplicit in the substantive law itself.  Id. \n 358. See id. \u00a7 5.02 cmt. d  (\u201cRelevant laws are those that include the issue within \ntheir scope.\u201d).  \n2025] GOVERNMENTAL INTEREST ANALYSIS  451 \nprovisions permit the court, at step two, to decline to apply forum law , even to cases \nwhere the conduct occurred in the state, if the state\u2019s rules of priority dictate \napplication of another state\u2019s law. In other words, when an external scope provision \nspecifies that the forum\u2019s law does extend to the case, the provision is presumed not \nto mandate application of forum law .359 But if the external scope provision goes \nfurther and specifies that the forum\u2019s law must  be applied to cases within the law\u2019s \nspecified scope, the forum\u2019s courts must apply the law even if another state\u2019s law \nwould be applicable under the forum\u2019s general rules of priority.360 This means that \nthe forum\u2019s authority to apply the forum\u2019s rules of priority comes from the \nsubstantive law itself. The draft Third Restatement  not only (implicitly) recognizes \nthat the forum court\u2019s freedom to apply rules of priority is a matter of interpreting \nthe forum\u2019s substantive law, it appears to adopt an interpretive presumption: only a \nsubstantive law that \u201cdirects\u201d application of forum  law forecloses application of the \nforum state\u2019s rules of priority.361 At bottom, therefore, the forum court\u2019s authority \nnot to apply forum law in the face of an external scope provision specifying that \nforum law reaches the case comes from the forum\u2019s substantive law, as interpreted \npursuant to the presumptions set forth in the draft Third Restatement . Forum law is, \naccording to the  logic of the draft Third Restatement , presumed to contain an \nimplicit permission to decline to apply forum law if the forum\u2019s rules of priority so \ndictate.  \nThe draft Third Restatement \u2019s rationale for the forum court\u2019s authority to \ndecline to apply forum law applies equally to cases where forum law does not \ncontain an external scope provision. For states that adopt the  draft Third \nRestatement , the multi -state reach of their laws will, in the absence of an external \nscope provision, be determined through a different presumption. As discussed in \nSection V.A, states that adopt the draft Third Restatement  will presume a broad \nmulti -state scope for their own statutes . If forum law, interpreted through this \npresumption, does extend to the case at step one, one must ask again, by what \nauthority does the forum court decline to apply this law and apply instead the \ndifferent law of another state? The answer to this questio n is the same as for cases \ninvolving an external scope provision: the authority to do so  is found in the \nsubstantive law itself. The presumption in favor of exterritoriality is qualified by an \n \n 359. See, e.g. , id. \u00a7 5.02 cmt. d ( \u201c[A] choice of law issue exists . . . [when] there are \nmaterial differences among relevant laws . . . .  If a choice -of-law issue exists, [courts must] \ndecide to which law it is most appropriate to give priority. \u201d).  \n 360. See, e.g. , id. \u00a7 5.02 cmt. d (\u201cIf a local statute directs the selection of a particular \nlaw, the court must follow that statute unless it is unconstitutional. \u201d). Although the draft Third \nRestatement  here may be referring to a general choice -of-law rule mandating application of a \nparticular state\u2019s law to particular types of cases, the same conclusion would appear to follow \nif an external scope provision mandat es application of the substantive law in question to \nparticular types of cases. Mandatory language in an external scope provision would rebut the \npresumption that the scope provision extends the reach of the statute to cases having particular \nconnections to the forum but does not mandate its application to such cases  and therefore does \nnot foreclose application of rules of priority .  \n 361. See id. \n452 ARIZONA LAW REVIEW  [VOL. 67: 391 \nadditional presumption \u2014a presumption allowing the nonapplication of forum law \nif rules of priority so dictate.362 \nIn sum, choice  of law is pervasively about the interpretation of the forum\u2019s \nsubstantive law on the subject matter of the dispute, and most of the work is done \nby presumptions. As we have shown, the various choice -of-law approaches differ as \nto how they interpret the forum\u2019s substantive laws as to their multi -state \napplicability. They do not differ in regarding the choice -of-law question as being a \nmatter of interpretation.  \nC. Step Two, Part Two: Ignoring State Interests, Selecting the Jurisdiction  \nIf we are right that even step two is about interpreting the forum\u2019s \nsubstantive laws as to their multi -state applicability, then we must look at the draft \nThird Restatement \u2019s step -two choice -of-law rules to determine the extent  to which  \nit carries forward or rejects Currie\u2019s legacy. We look in detail at the sections \naddressing choice of law in tort. Although the draft Third Restatement  is still being \ndeveloped, its current provisions for tort cases indicate that it does not contemplate \na choice -of-law approach that turns on the type of purposivist analysis that Currie \nchampioned. Rather, the draft Third Restatement  sets forth a set of jurisdiction -\nselecting rules that leave little room for judicial consideration of state purposes or \ninterest s in passing statutes or developing common -law rules governing  tort liability. \nThe only trace of Currie -style purposivism comes in the application of a narrow \nescape clause allowing the draft Third Restatement \u2019s presumptive rules to be \noverridden when application of a different state\u2019s law is \u201cmanifestly more \nappropriate.\u201d363 \nChapter six of the draft Third Restatement  provides rules for resolving \nconflicts in the application of tort law. It instructs that in the absence of a valid \nchoice -of-law agreement by the parties, \u201ca tort issue is governed by the law of the \nstate with the dominant interest in the issue.\u201d364 Lest that language suggest a Currie -\nstyle analysis, however, the draft Third Restatement  goes on to explain that the state \nwith a \u201cdominant interest\u201d will be determined by one of two sets of rules: either (1) \na tort - or issue -specific set of rules or (2) a set of rules applicable depending upon \nwhether \u201cthe issue in question relates to conduc t or to persons.\u201d365 The draft Third \n \n 362. If the forum \u2019s law on the matter is a common -law rule, the authority to decline \nto apply the rule even though the rule by hypothesis extends to the case must be found in an \ninterpretive presumption allowing for the nonapplication of forum common -law if rules of \npriority so dictate.  Of course, if the forum \u2019s law is a common law rule, the \u201clegislators \u201d are \nthe courts themselves.  But this does not alter the analysis.  Even for statutory cases, the \n\u201clegislators \u201d of the two presumptions (if the statute does not contain an external scope \nprovision) \u2014the presumption that the law extends broadly to all cases involving conduct in \nthe state and domiciliaries of the state acting abroad, and the presumption that the court  is \nauthorized not to apply the law if rules of priority so dictate \u2014are the courts as well.  \n 363.

Id. \n2025] GOVERNMENTAL INTEREST ANALYSIS  453 \nRestatement  expressly instructs courts not to perform an interest analysis \nthemselves, as it has performed the analysis for them.366 \nThe first set currently provides jurisdiction -selecting rules for products -\nliability actions367 and awarding punitive damages.368 For our purposes, the details \nof the rules are not significant. What matters is what they don\u2019t  contemplate: a \ndetermination of the multi -state applicability of the relevant law through judicial \nexamination of the purposes behind a state\u2019s products -liability or punitive -damages \npolicies. Indeed, the content of the relevant rule appears to be  irrelevant. Instead, the \ndraft Third Restatement  selects the appropriate jurisdiction\u2019s law depending on a \nnumber of objective factors \u2014e.g., \u201cthe state where the product was delivered\u201d369 or \n\u201cthe place of conduct.\u201d370 \nOutside of these specific areas, the same picture emerges . Gone are the \npurposive inquiries prescribed by Currie and encouraged by the Second \nRestatement \u2019s \u201cmost significant relationship\u201d test. In their place, we find rules that \noperate by selecting the relevant jurisdiction\u2019s law on the basis of some objective \nset of factors. The draft Third Restatement  first divides the universe of potentially \nrelevant issues or connecting factors into two groups: (a) \u201c [i]ssues relating to \nconduct,\u201d where  \u201cterritorial connecting factors such as the location of the conduct \nor injury are of primary importance\u201d;371 and (b) \u201c [i]ssues relating to persons,\u201d where  \n\u201cpersonal connecting factors such as the parties\u2019 domicile are of primary \nimportance.\u201d372 As the draft Third Restatement  notes, this division is a familiar one \nin choice of law, commonly referred to as the distinction between \u201cconduct \nregulation\u201d and \u201closs allocation.\u201d373 Conduct -regulating rules, as the Second \nRestatement  explains, were commonly thought to be designed \u201cto punish the \ntortfeasor and thus  to deter others,\u201d while loss -allocation rules were \u201cdesigned \nprimarily to compensate the victim.\u201d374 The draft Third Restatement  observes that \nthe Second Restatement  made this distinction \u201cas part of [its] analysis of state \npolicies and interests,\u201d and thus the distinction \u201cis present in, or at least consistent \nwith, any modern policy -based approach to choice of law.\u201d375 \nBut the draft Third Restatement \u2019s deployment of this distinction is notably \ndifferent. For instance, it first elaborates a set of \u201c [i]ssues relating to conduct,\u201d which \ninclude \u201cstandards of conduct or safety,\u201d \u201cprerequisites for liability,\u201d various duties \nor defenses, and the \u201cscope of liability,\u201d among others.376 For such issues, the draft \nThird Restatement  provides a set of jurisdiction -selecting rules to determine the \nappropriate law.

When the parties share a common domicile, \u201cthat state\u2019s law governs \nan issue relating to persons.\u201d380 Indeed, underlining the shift away from Currie, the \ndraft Third Restatement  explicitly notes that \u201cthe rule of this Section does not depend \non the claim that no other state has a contrary policy or interest.\u201d381 Rather, the rule \nis presented as \u201ca sensible and widely accepted resolution of this conflict.\u201d382 \nConversely, if the \u201crelevant parties are domiciled in states whose laws are in material \nconflict,\u201d but the \u201cconduct and injury occur in a single state,\u201d then \u201cthat state\u2019s law \ngoverns an issue relating to persons.\u201d383 (Recall that if conduct and injury occur in \ndifferent states, the law of the state of conduct governs issues relating both to persons \nand to conduct.384) Thus, for the range of issues that are considered \u201closs -allocation\u201d \nissues \u2014or issues relating to persons \u2014the draft Third Restatement  again provides a \nset of fairly comprehensive jurisdiction -selecting rules.  \nAs should be apparent, the vast majority of factual scenarios presented by \na tort action are covered by the draft Third Restatement \u2019s rules.385 Our point is not \n \n 377.

If the particular rule involved in a given case does not \nappear on the draft Third Restatement \u2019s list of rules deemed conduct -regulating or loss -\nallocati ng, the court would presumably have to apply a form of purposive analysis to \ndetermine if the rule falls into one category or the other, but this would seem to involve a \ngeneralized purposive analysis very different from the sort of imaginative reconstruction \ncontemplated by Currie.  \n2025] GOVERNMENTAL INTEREST ANALYSIS  455 \nthat these rules are not sensible.  (Indeed, we are broadly supportive of the draft Third \nRestatement \u2019s shift away from Currie -style purposivism and towards more \ndeterminate rules.386) As the draft Third Restatement  notes in many places, the rules \nwere formulated as distillations of majority practices across many jurisdictions. Our \npoint is, rather, that the draft Third Restatement \u2019s articulation of jurisdiction -\nselecting rules to govern the mine run of tort actions has mostly foreclosed any \ninterest -based analysis that would otherwise have been conducted under the Second \nRestatement  or other Currie -inspired approaches to choice of law. Drafts of sections \naddressing property and contract issues reveal a similar approach.387 \nThere is one interesting caveat to this picture. The draft Third Restatement  \ncontains an escape hatch , permitting states to decline to use \u201c[t]he law selected by \nthe rules of this Restatement\u201d if \u201ca case presents exceptional and unaccounted -for \ncircumstances that make the use of a different state\u2019s law manifestly more \nappropriate.\u201d388 As an example of an \u201cunaccounted -for\u201d issue, the commentary to \nthis section suggests the connecting factor of a \u201cpre -existing relationship between \nthe parties\u201d to a tort action that is \u201cof overwhelming importance.\u201d389 This escape \nhatch from the otherwise highly prescriptive rules of the draft Third Restatement  \nsuggests the possibility of a continuing role for purposive \u2014or at least interest -\nbased \u2014analysis of state laws and policies. The illustrations in the section suggest \nthat such an analysis is contemplated.390 But the draft Third Restatement  cautions \nthat there is meant to be a \u201chigh bar\u201d for invocation of the exception.391 Thus, to the \nextent that the \u201cmanifestly more appropriate\u201d exception preserves any role for \nCurrie -style purposive analysis, it appears to be a small one.  \nWith the exception of that escape hatch, the subject -area-specific rules of \nthe draft Third Restatement  are meant to govern the choice of relevant state laws. \nThe draft Third Restatement  presents its rules as a working through of the relevant \nstate interests that \u201ccourts are currently reaching under labor -intensive multifactor \nbalancing tests.\u201d392 That is, the draft Third Restatement  is meant to be the finished \nproduct of a well -executed interest analysis. But  if that\u2019s so, what it has worked \nthrough seems very different from what Currie had in mind. The presumptive rules \napply to whole categories of cases without regard to the content or case -specific \npurposes of the relevant statutes or legal rules.

And as we\u2019ve \nseen, the rules of priority that the draft Third Restatement  recommends \u2014in the \nabsence of statutory or contractual specifications to the contrary \u2014leave little room \nat all for the purposive analysis that was central to Currie\u2019s resolution of these issues.  \nThe result is striking. The draft Third Restatement  has constructed a choice -\nof-law framework where  the selection of the appropriate state law is largely \ndetermined by a set of jurisdiction -selecting rules that apply regardless of the \npurposes or interests of the relevant states. Despite repeated hat  tips to Currie, the \ndraft Third Restatement  in practice largely turns its back on him. The only directly \nacknowledged influence of Currie in the draft Third Restatement  is the idea that \nchoice of law is a matter of interpretation \u2014an idea that, as we\u2019ve noted, long \npredates Currie. When it comes to Currie\u2019s central contribution \u2014the application of \na purposive method of interpretation to state laws and policies \u2014the draft Third \nRestatement  has replicated in form, if not in substance, the rejection that has already \ntaken place in the federal courts. If the draft Third Restat ement  is widely adopted by \nstates in the same manner that the Second Restatement  has been , it would hasten the \ndemise of governmental interest analysis,  Currie\u2019s central contribution to choice of \nlaw. \nCONCLUSION  \nOur aims in this Article have been both descriptive and normative. \nDescriptively, we have shown that choice of law has been conceived by adherents \nof both traditional and modern approaches as, at bottom, a matter of statutory \ninterpretation \u2014a matter of interpreting forum la w as to its multi -state applicability. \nThe innovation of the adherents of governmental interest analysis was to bring a \nparticular approach to statutory interpretation to bear on the matter: the highly \npurposive approach of the Legal Proc ess School. We have also described the \nrevolution that has taken place in statutory -interpretation theory , focusing on its \ncritique of purposivism. The Supreme Court that has led that revolution has also \ndeparted from the purposivist approach to determining the multi -state applicability \nof federal laws that prevailed earlier . The response of state courts has been murkier. \nBut the current draft of the Third Restatement  proposes an approach to choice of law \nthat mirrors in form the approach the Supreme Court has taken in the federal sphere. \nIf it is widely adopted by states, as its predecessor has been , the draft Third \nRestatement  can be expected to accelerate the decline of governmental interest \nanalysis.  \nNormatively, we have argued that the insights of the modern critique of \npurposivism deprive Curr ie-style interest analysis \u2014and related approaches, such as \nthe multi -factor, open -ended , all-things -considered balancing process of the Second \nRestatement \u2014of their claim to superiority from the perspective of legislative \nsupremacy. In the cases that mainly concern us, the legislature has given no thought \nto the multi -state applicability of the laws it enacts. The legislature\u2019s substantive \npurposes \u2014i.e., its  purpo ses in the purely internal case \u2014do not yield reliable \n \n 393. See supra  Section V.A.  \n2025] GOVERNMENTAL INTEREST ANALYSIS  457 \nconclusions regarding the legislature\u2019s preferences with respect to the law\u2019s multi -\nstate applicability. Any approach that claims reliably to implement those preferences \nis, we  have argued, premised on a series of misapprehensions.  \nThis is not to say that the modern critique of governmental interest analysis \nprecludes an approach resembling the one Curr ie proposed, or the one adopted by \nthe Second Restatement . It means that the state\u2019s courts (or their legislatures, if they \nenact general choice -of-law rules) must take responsibility for the adoption of \nwhichever approach they adopt . None is required by the need to be faithful to \nlegislative preferences. Judicial lawmaking \u2014in the form of the establishment of an \napproach that applies in the absence of legislative direction on the question of multi -\nstate applicability \u2014is inevitable, and the cour ts (or legislatures) must justify their \nchoice of interpretive rule.  \nA court could articulate one of an almost infinite variety of determinate \npresumptions for or against extraterritoriality, as both the U.S. Supreme Court and \nthe draft Third Restatement  have done. Or it could devise a test whereby the \napplicability of forum law for certain categories of cases would turn on whether the \nregulated party is from the state, and for other categories on whether particular acts \nor events happened in the state, a s traditional choice -of-law rules have generally \ndone. At the other ext reme, it could adopt a case - and context -specific , multi -factor, \nall-things -considered balancing test of the sort contemplated by the Second \nRestatement . Our critique of purposivism shows that the choice among these \napproaches will have to be justified based on considerations other than reflecting \nlegislative preferences, such as how well the test identifies the types of disputes that \nanother state has a greater claim to regulating while promoting an appropriate degree \nof certainty and predictability, among  many other considerations. This is not the \nplace to assess the costs and benefits of the various contending approaches. Our \nclaim is merely that these are the considerations on which  the choice should rest.  \nAlmost 70 years after the revolution Currie initiated, the field of choice of \nlaw appears poised for a counterrevolution  in light of the revolution that has \noccurred in the field of statutory interpretation .",

On Monday, April 29, the Supreme Court of the United States agreed to hear a case this fall with the potential to significantly broaden U.S. veterans\u2019 opportunities to receive VA benefits.[1] The case, Bufkin v. McDonough, centers on two veterans\u2014Joshua Bufkin and Norman Thornton\u2014who were denied medical benefits by the Department of Veterans Affairs and Board of Veterans Appeals (\u201cBVA\u201d).[2] Bufkin and Thornton each sought VA benefits for PTSD in connection with their military service, but were denied after the VA decided that examinations by VA psychologists outweighed the veterans\u2019 prior examinations and diagnoses.[3] These rulings were reviewed and affirmed by the U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (the \u201cVeterans Court\u201d), which found merely that the BVA didn\u2019t make any clear mistakes about the facts of the petitioners\u2019 cases.[4] Bufkin and Thornton appealed the Veterans Court decisions, arguing that these denials violated a principle called the \u201cbenefit-of-the-doubt\u201d rule.[5] They lost their cases at the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals, but now that the Supreme Court has accepted their petition for review, they have a new shot at changing the way that the VA thinks about veterans\u2019 benefits.[6] The Benefit-of-the-Doubt Rule Boiled down to basics, Bufkin v. McDonough is about the application of the benefit-of-the-doubt rule to appeals of BVA decisions. The benefit-of-the-doubt rule is a well-established policy in veterans\u2019 law: when the evidence in favor of and against a veteran\u2019s benefits claim is approximately balanced, the VA department should rule in favor of the veteran\u2019s claim.[7]\u00a0 In 1988, Congress codified the benefit-of-the-doubt rule into law as 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 5107(b): (b) Benefit of the doubt. The Secretary [of Veteran\u2019s Affairs] shall consider all information and lay and medical evidence of record in a case before the Secretary with respect to benefits under laws administered by the Secretary. When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, the secretary shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant.[8] This mandate applies to disability and benefits determinations by the VA office and BVA, and is further established within the Department of Veterans Affairs\u2019 own regulations\u2014when there is a reasonable doubt about some aspect of a VA disability claim, and the evidence is about the same weight on either side, that doubt should be resolved in favor of the claimant.[9] In 2002, Congress passed the Veterans\u2019 Benefits Act (\u201cVBA\u201d), modifying the Veterans Court\u2019s power to review BVA decisions.[10] The language in one part of the VBA, 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7261, forms the basis of Bufkin\u2019s issue in controversy.[11] Section 7261(a) requires the Veterans Court (when reviewing BVA decisions) to decide legal questions; compel unlawfully-withheld action by the Secretary of Veterans\u2019 Affairs; set aside BVA decisions that are arbitrary, capricious, unconstitutional, unlawful, or lacking in due procedure; and reverse findings of fact that are \u201cclearly erroneous.\u201d[12] Section 7261(b) states that when the Veterans Court makes a determination on an appeal from the BVA, \u201cthe Court shall review the record of proceedings before the Secretary and the Board of Veterans\u2019 Appeals . . . and shall take due account of the Secretary\u2019s application of [the benefit-of-the-doubt rule].\u201d[13] Bufkin and Thornton argued that under the VBA\u2019s Section 7261(b), the Veterans Court must conduct a much more generous review of closely-balanced issues than it did before.[14] If Congress\u2019s passage of the VBA is to mean anything at all, they claim, then it must require deeper attention to benefit-of-the-doubt on appeal.[15] Bufkin\u2019s Federal Circuit holding and arguments before the Supreme Court In August 2023, the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals ruled on Bufkin and Thornton\u2019s cases and rejected their more generous interpretation of Section 7261.[16] The Federal Circuit held that under Section 7261(b), the Veterans Court is only required to examine BVA findings and applications of the benefit-of-the-doubt rule for clear error\u2014the same scope and standard of review permitted by Section 7261(a).[17] Clear error is a difficult standard to meet in a lawsuit. Under this ruling, the Veterans Court has no obligation to separately review whether or not a veteran actually received the benefit of the doubt on close material issues of a case; only whether or not the BVA made an obvious factual mistake when applying it.[18] Bufkin and Thornton\u2019s petition to the Supreme Court argues that Section 7261(b) requires the Veterans Court to conduct a separate analysis of whether or not a veteran received the benefit of the doubt on close disputed issues before the VA Department and BVA\u2014regardless of whether the BVA made \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d factual findings under 7261(a), and regardless of whether or not a veteran claimant accused the BVA of factual error or inappropriate application of the benefit-of-the-doubt rule on appeal.[19] The reading of Section 7261 proposed by Bufkin and Thornton is much broader than the Federal Circuit\u2019s rule. If the Supreme Court affirms the Federal Circuit, the old rule will remain in place\u2014but if the Supreme Court chooses to agree with the petitioners, it could open up a whole new world for veterans across the country to challenge past disability determinations where the VA failed to give enough deference to their needs. Permitting broader review by courts appealing VA decisions may allow veterans with close cases to successfully receive needed benefits, where previously the Veterans Court might not have given their cases a deeper look. The current Supreme Court justices have proven themselves sympathetic to veterans\u2019 needs in another recent decision, Rudisill v. McDonough, where a 7-2 majority voted to broaden access to overlapping GI Bill benefits[20]\u2014so keep an eye on Bufkin during the 2024-25 term.

Justices consider whether equitable tolling is available to veterans. By\t\t\t\t\t\t\tYelena Duterte on Oct 6, 2022 In Tuesday\u2019s oral argument, the Supreme Court grappled with three main issues in Arellano v. McDonough, a case about retroactive disability benefits for veterans who failed to apply for those benefits within the one-year window prescribed by a federal statute. First, the court looked into whether 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 5110(b)(1) is a statute of limitations to determine whether the Irwin presumption, which allows for equitable tolling, applies. Second, if it is a statute of limitations, the court pondered whether Congress rebutted the presumption that equitable tolling is available to veterans. Finally, the court focused on the practicality of the Department of Veterans Affairs applying equitable tolling. For background, in 1981, Adolfo Arellano was discharged from the military with a severe mental health condition. Arellano did not file for benefits until 2011, 30 years after service, because his disability left him unable to understand that he was eligible to file a claim for benefits. The VA awarded him disability benefits, but only going back to the date he filed. Arellano is asking the court to allow him a chance to argue for retroactive benefits back to 1981, through the doctrine of equitable tolling. To determine if equitable tolling can apply, the court first must determine whether Section 5110(b)(1) is a statute of limitations. When considering this, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson framed her understanding of statutes of limitation as a \u201cfunneling effect.\u201d She described typical statutes of limitation as preventing a party from pursuing a claim or lawsuit and funneling out certain people if they waited too long to file. Here, Jackson styled Section 5110 and its exceptions as more of a pyramid. The general rule, under subsection (a), provides that the date the application is filed is the start date of payments. Subsection (b), however, creates an exception, allowing for more benefits, up to a year more, and thus producing a pyramid effect rather than a funnel. James Barney, arguing on behalf of Arellano, explained that the court should focus on the exception to the rule and whether the exception can be equitably tolled, rather than how it interfaces with the general rule. Justice Elena Kagan asked the government\u2019s lawyer, Assistant to the Solicitor General Sopan Joshi, whether statutes need to have specific or magic language or whether a statute of limitation can be functional without special words, as discussed in Lozano v. Alvarez. Joshi argued that this statute does not \u201cwalk or quack\u201d like a statute of limitations and it doesn\u2019t function as one either. Thus, the presumption should not apply. Although the government does not concede that this is a statute of limitation, it believes the statutory language rebuts the Irwin presumption. Justice Sonia Sotomayor questioned whether the language in Section 5110(a) rebuts the presumption where it states, \u201cUnless specifically provided otherwise in this chapter, the effective date \u2026 shall not be earlier than the date of receipt of application.\u201d Barney argued that the court, in United States v. Kwai Fun Wong, found words of emphasis like these are not definitive on this question of rebuttal. He went on to identify that this exception is the only exception that impacts VA disability compensation. He insisted that the court look narrowly at whether Congress has spoken on this exception to rebut the presumption. Chief Justice John Roberts questioned the government on the context here, pointing out that this is an agency to support disabled veterans and not an agency with rigid rules, like the IRS. Although the chief sidestepped the issue of the veteran\u2019s canon, he seemed interested in whether statutes for this agency should have a different standard than others. The chief justice also pointed out that the statute\u2019s 16 exceptions may cut against the government. Specifically, Congress has waived its sovereign immunity, has allowed many exceptions to the rule already, and has not explicitly barred equitable tolling in the statute itself. Joshi asked the court to look at the statute as a whole and argued that, if Congress wanted equitable tolling, it would have explicitly provided for that exception. Finally, the court asks several questions about the practicality of an agency applying equitable tolling. Jackson questioned Barney about whether an agency can handle this type of question, as equitable tolling is usually a matter reserved for the judiciary. Barney explained that the agency already looks at equitable tolling when appeals are late and whether good cause applies. Justice Samuel Alito inquired whether the analysis would be any different for veterans like the Edgewood veterans who were prevented from disclosing classified information. Joshi provided a couple of ways a veteran could apply, conceding that these will likely not fully resolve the issue. He asserted that Congress could pass legislation to allow veterans like the Edgewood veterans to obtain additional benefits. Beyond the context of veterans\u2019 benefits, the court\u2019s eventual decision may flesh out a definition of a statute of limitations and clarify how explicit Congress must be to rebut the Irwin presumption.

          "task_beliefs": "My understanding of this case continues to evolve from a general question into a detailed map of the legal battlefield. The previous observation of the Petitioner's Brief provided the offensive strategy; this observation of the Respondent's Brief in Opposition provides the defensive line, clarifying the precise points of contention.\n\n-   **Previous State:** My knowledge was defined by the petitioner's arguments: the Barring Act is a \"gap-filler,\" the CRSC statute is an \"other law\" with a complete settlement framework, and the Federal Circuit erred by requiring the magic word \"settle\" or a separate statute of limitations. The pro-veteran canon was a secondary argument.\n-   **New Information (Respondent's Counter-Arguments):** The Brief for the United States provides a robust counter-narrative.\n    -   **Barring Act as the Default, Not a Gap-Filler:** The government frames the Barring Act (31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3702) not as a mere \"gap-filler\" but as the \"comprehensive remedy for the settlement of claims\" against the U.S. It argues that this default framework governs *unless* superseded by another law that *expressly* provides its own settlement procedure. This directly refutes the petitioner's core premise.\n    -   **A More Demanding Definition of \"Settle\":** The government, citing *Illinois Sur. Co. v. United States* (1916), defines \"settle\" as the \"final administrative determination regarding the government\u2019s total liability on a claim,\" including adjustments and offsets. This is a more holistic and final-sounding definition than the petitioner's two-step process (determine validity, determine amount). The conflict over this definition is a central issue.\n    -   **Distinction Between Substantive Right and Procedural Remedy:** This is the government's primary analytical tool. They argue that the CRSC statute (10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1413a) merely establishes a veteran's *substantive right* to the payment and the criteria for eligibility. It does *not*, they contend, create the *procedural mechanism* to \"settle\" disputed claims for past-due amounts. That procedure, they argue, is provided by the Barring Act.\n    -   **The \"Congress Knows How\" Argument:** The government powerfully argues that when Congress wants to displace the Barring Act, it does so expressly. They provide concrete examples: the Federal Tort Claims Act (28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2672) and the Military Claims Act (10 U.S.C. \u00a7 2733) both explicitly use the word \"settle\" and provide their own statutes of limitation. The absence of such language in the CRSC statute is presented as dispositive evidence that Congress did not intend to displace the Barring Act.\n    -   **Reframing the Federal Circuit's Test:** The government defends the Federal Circuit's reasoning, not as inventing a rigid test, but as correctly looking for the clear textual indicators of displacement (like the word \"settle\" or a separate limitations period) that are present in other statutes but absent here.\n-   **Current Understanding of the Core Legal Tension:** The case hinges on a fundamental question of statutory interpretation: Does the CRSC statute, by detailing eligibility and payment calculations, create an *implicit* settlement scheme that qualifies as an \"other law\" displacing the Barring Act? (Petitioner's view). Or, must a statute use *express* language of settlement or provide its own limitations period to displace the comprehensive, default framework of the Barring Act? (Respondent's view).\n-   **Confidence and Prediction:** My confidence in a final prediction remains guarded, but the government's argument appears structurally strong and aligns with common interpretive principles favored by the current Court (e.g., clear statement rules, textualism). The \"Congress knows how to do X, and didn't do it here\" argument is often persuasive. The petitioner's case requires the Court to make a series of inferences, while the government's case asks the Court to simply apply the plain text of the Barring Act in the absence of a clear command to do otherwise. The balance of my belief has shifted slightly towards the government's position being more likely to prevail.",
          "design_beliefs": "My meta-level understanding of how to approach legal prediction tasks has been significantly enhanced. Each observation not only adds facts but also refines the very process of inquiry.\n\n-   **Previous State:** My design was validated by prioritizing primary source analysis (the Petitioner's Brief). This led to the creation of the \"Argument Prioritization\" heuristic (textualism over canons) and a refined research agenda focused on acquiring the counter-argument.\n-   **New Information and Refinements:**\n    -   **Validation of \"Acquire the Counter-Argument\":** This observation confirms that a legal problem cannot be understood in monologue. Analyzing one side's brief illuminates the questions; analyzing the opposing brief illuminates the *actual conflict*. This confirms a core D-level principle: **A legal prediction is incomplete and unreliable until the primary arguments of *both* sides have been analyzed and juxtaposed.**\n    -   **New Heuristic - The \"Clear Statement\" Principle:** The government's argument highlights a recurring theme in administrative and federal claims law. I am adding a new heuristic: **When a general, long-standing statutory framework exists (especially for claims against the U.S. government), arguments that a more specific statute implicitly displaces it face a high bar. The most effective counter-argument will be to demand a \"clear statement\" or \"express language\" from Congress and to show examples where Congress has provided it elsewhere.**\n    -   **New Heuristic - Distinguishing Rights from Remedies:** The government's successful framing of the issue as a distinction between a substantive right (in the CRSC statute) and a procedural remedy (in the Barring Act) is a powerful and broadly applicable analytical tool. I will formalize this as a D-level principle: **When analyzing conflicting statutes, deconstruct them into their substantive and procedural components. A statute creating a right to payment does not automatically create the procedure for litigating or settling claims for that payment; that procedure may reside in a different, more general law.**\n    -   **Updated Research Agenda:** My plan of action is now laser-focused on the central conflict.\n        1.  **Analyze the Fulcrum:** The entire case now turns on which interpretive framework the Court will prefer: the petitioner's inferential \"implicit displacement\" model or the government's textualist \"express displacement\" model. Future research must be geared toward finding which model the Court has favored in recent, analogous cases.\n        2.  **Precedent Deep Dive:** The key precedent is now clearly *Illinois Surety Co.*, as both parties cite it to support their competing definitions of \"settle.\" Understanding how that case has been interpreted is critical. The government's list of statutes that *do* expressly displace the Barring Act (FTCA, etc.) are now key data points for my analysis.\n        3.  **Canon Re-evaluation:** The government's complete omission of the pro-veteran canon in its argument further strengthens my D-level belief that such canons are treated as tie-breakers at best by savvy litigators before the current Court, not as primary tools of persuasion. The main event is the textual and structural debate."

          "task_beliefs": "My model of this case is becoming increasingly nuanced, moving from a simple clash of statutes to a complex interplay of interpretive philosophy, statutory context, and judicial predisposition. The government's defense, which previously seemed structurally formidable, now appears to have identifiable vulnerabilities.\n\n-   **Previous State:** The central conflict was clear: the petitioner's \"implicit displacement\" argument (the CRSC statute is a complete scheme) versus the respondent's \"express displacement\" argument (the Barring Act is the default unless a statute explicitly says it \"settles\" claims or has its own limitations period). I had noted the structural strength of the government's \"Congress knows how to do X\" argument and my belief had shifted slightly in its favor.\n-   **New Information (Analogous Case Signals):** The search results provide crucial context from other, highly similar veterans' benefits cases, acting as powerful predictive signals.\n    -   **Direct Challenge to the Government's Core Argument (*Arellano*):** The analysis of *Arellano v. McDonough* is the most significant new piece of evidence. This case also involves a time limit on retroactive veterans' benefits and features the *exact same* structural argument from the government: if Congress wanted an exception (in that case, equitable tolling), it would have said so explicitly. The observation reveals that this argument is not being accepted uncritically by the Court.\n        -   **Chief Justice Roberts's Skepticism:** His reported questioning is a major signal. He contrasted the VA, an agency meant to support veterans, with a rigid agency like the IRS, suggesting that interpretive rules might apply differently. This directly supports the petitioner's use of the pro-veteran canon as a contextual tool.\n        -   **Flipping the \"Congress Knows How\" Argument:** Roberts also reportedly suggested that the existence of many other statutory exceptions could argue *in favor* of the Court finding another one, rather than against it. This logic could be directly imported into the *Soto* case: if the CRSC statute details eligibility and payment, the Court might see it as another, albeit implicit, exception to the Barring Act's general framework.\n    -   **Evidence of Pro-Veteran Rulings (*Rudisill*):** The blog post on *Bufkin v. McDonough* notes the recent 7-2 decision in *Rudisill v. McDonough*, where the Court broadened veterans' access to GI Bill benefits. This serves as a concrete counter-example to the idea that the current Court's textualism will always lead to a narrow, pro-government reading of benefits statutes. It demonstrates a willingness to find for veterans, even with a text-focused majority.\n    -   **General Trend of Textualism (*Choice of Law* article):** The academic article confirms the broader jurisprudential shift away from purposivism (\"what would Congress have wanted?\") toward textualism, which underpins the government's entire strategy. It notes the Court requires a \"clear indication\" from Congress to displace default rules. This confirms the *theoretical* strength of the government's position, but the other observations show its *practical application* is contested.\n-   **Current Understanding of the Core Legal Tension:** The tension remains between implicit and express displacement, but it is now filtered through a new, critical question: **Will the Court apply its default \"clear statement\" rules rigidly, or will it soften them due to the specific, pro-beneficiary context of veterans' law?** The government's argument relies on the former; the petitioner's case is significantly strengthened by evidence suggesting the latter is a real possibility.\n-   **Confidence and Prediction:** My previous, slight lean toward the government has been neutralized. The evidence from *Arellano* is a powerful counter-signal, revealing that the Chief Justice and potentially others are receptive to arguments that the veterans' benefits system is unique and not subject to the most rigid forms of textualism. The outcome of *Soto* now appears to be a genuine toss-up. The strength of the petitioner's case has increased in my model, as it relies on the very contextual and purposive nuances that some justices seem willing to entertain.",
          "design_beliefs": "My methodology for legal prediction is becoming more sophisticated, recognizing that abstract interpretive theories are mediated by the specific context of the law being interpreted. The value of analyzing contemporaneous, analogous cases is now a cornerstone of my approach.\n\n-   **Previous State:** My design principles included \"Acquire the Counter-Argument,\" \"Argument Prioritization\" (textualism over canons), the \"Clear Statement Principle,\" and \"Distinguishing Rights from Remedies.\" My research agenda was focused on finding precedents that fit these frameworks.\n-   **New Information and Refinements:**\n    -   **Validation of \"Clear Statement Principle\":** This observation strongly validates that identifying this principle was correct. The government is using it as a primary weapon in both *Soto* and the analogous *Arellano* case. It is clearly a central heuristic in the government's own litigation strategy before the Supreme Court.\n    -   **New Heuristic - \"Contextual Canon Application\":** The \"Clear Statement Principle\" is not absolute. This observation forces a major refinement. I am adding a new principle: **The stringency of interpretive canons (like clear statement rules) is context-dependent. They may be applied more loosely in pro-beneficiary statutory schemes (e.g., veterans' law) than in neutral or adversarial contexts (e.g., tax law, commercial disputes).** Chief Justice Roberts's reported comments in *Arellano* are the primary evidence for this crucial refinement.\n    -   **Refinement of \"Argument Prioritization\":** My prior belief that textualism sits cleanly atop a hierarchy above substantive canons was too simplistic. The new evidence suggests a more interactive model. Substantive canons (like the pro-veteran canon) and background context can act as a lens that influences *how* the textual and structural analysis is conducted. The hierarchy is less of a ladder and more of a web, where context can determine which textual interpretation is deemed most reasonable.\n    -   **New Heuristic - \"Analogous Pending Case Analysis\":** This is a major breakthrough. The highest-value information in this observation came from analyzing cases currently or recently before the Court that share key features (parties, subject matter, legal arguments) with the target case. This is more powerful than looking at older, settled precedent. I will now prioritize searching for SCOTUSblog argument analyses, cert petitions, and summaries of pending cases that mirror the one I am analyzing.\n    -   **Updated Research Agenda:** My plan of action is now more targeted and effective.\n        1.  **Track the Analogs:** The highest priority is to determine the final disposition of *Arellano v. McDonough*. The reasoning in that majority opinion will be the single most powerful predictor for *Soto*.\n        2.  **Deconstruct the Pro-Veteran Precedent:** I must perform a deep dive on the majority opinion in *Rudisill v. McDonough*. How did the 7-justice majority navigate the statutory text to reach a pro-veteran outcome? Did they use the pro-veteran canon explicitly as a tie-breaker, or did they use it more subtly to frame the entire analysis? This will provide a template for how a pro-petitioner majority might rule in *Soto*.\n        3.  **Synthesize Competing Models:** My goal is no longer just to identify the two competing arguments, but to model the judicial philosophies that support them. One model is a rigid, context-independent textualism. The other is a context-sensitive textualism where the statute's purpose (e.g., helping veterans) informs the reading of the text. My prediction will depend on which model I believe can get five votes."

Collins, No. 23-713: This case involves the \u201cbenefit-of-the-doubt rule,\u201d a unique standard of proof the Department of Veterans Affairs (\u201cVA\u201d) applies to a claim for service-related disability benefits that tips the scales in a veteran\u2019s favor when \u201cthere is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence\u201d on any material issue. Petitioners applied for benefits and were dissatisfied with the VA\u2019s adverse determinations, which the Board of Veterans\u2019 Appeals reviewed de novo and denied. Those decisions were upheld by the U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (\u201cVeterans Court\u201d) on grounds that the Board\u2019s \u201capproximate balance\u201d determinations were not clearly erroneous. Petitioners appealed to the Federal Circuit, challenging the Veterans Court\u2019s legal interpretation of 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7261(b)(1), which requires the Veterans Court to \u201ctake due account\u201d of the VA\u2019s application of the \u201cbenefit-of-the-doubt rule.\u201d The Federal Circuit affirmed, rejecting Petitioners\u2019 argument that \u201ctake due account\u201d means the Veterans Court must review the entire record de novo and decide for itself whether the evidence is in \u201capproximate balance.\u201d In a 7-2 decision authored by Justice Thomas, the Court affirmed the Federal Circuit and held that the Veterans Court must review the VA\u2019s application of the \u201cbenefit-of-the-doubt rule\u201d the same way it would any other determination\u2014by reviewing legal issues de novo and factual issues for clear error. 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7261(a) defines the scope of Veterans Court review and empowers the Veterans Court to decide relevant questions of law; compel action unlawfully withheld or unreasonably delayed; and hold unlawful and set aside VA findings, conclusions, rules, and regulations that are arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law. Under 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7261(a)(4), the Veterans Court may set aside or reverse factual findings only if \u201cclearly erroneous,\u201d and the VA\u2019s determination that the evidence is in \u201capproximate balance\u201d is a predominantly factual determination reviewed only for clear error.

Congress legislates in broad terms and agencies fill in technical details on myriad issues, from how Medicaid eligibility is determined to how Medicare providers are paid to how new drugs are approved for market.

Writing for the majority, Chief Justice John Roberts sought to allay concern that courts lack the technical knowledge possessed by agencies to inform their interpretation of laws. He observed that when reviewing agency regulations, courts \u201cdo not decide such questions blindly\u201d but instead benefit from the perspectives of amici \u201csteeped in the subject matter.\u201dLoper Bright\u2019s impact has been swift. Within five days, three courts rejected the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 (HHS) interpretation of the Affordable Care Act\u2019s civil rights provision (Section 1557) as barring health care discrimination based on gender identity. HHS\u2019s regulation is consistent with Supreme Court precedent and reflects extensive evidence amassed from public comment. But with the Chevron deference gone, courts were free to ignore the agency\u2019s expert analysis, with the result that HHS cannot enforce these protections nationwide. The cases are being appealed; if the trial courts\u2019 decisions become final, HHS won\u2019t be able to remedy cases in which health care providers or insurers use a patient\u2019s gender identity to deny necessary care or coverage, despite the agency\u2019s expert conclusion that doing so adversely affects health and exacerbates inequities. In two months after Loper Bright, courts have overruled agencies\u2019 interpretations of federal law in 22 of 26 cases.The Importance of Amicus BriefsAmicus briefs are written legal arguments filed by groups or individuals who aren\u2019t directly involved in a case as a litigant but nevertheless have a vested interest in the outcome. They can offer courts subject matter expertise and insight, and it is imperative that they contain reliable evidence. The first amicus brief was filed more than 200 years ago; today, they are standard practice. The number of amicus briefs filed in Supreme Court cases has steadily increased, with 911 in the 2019\u20132020 term, an average of 16 per argued case. Mega-cases (with more than 30 amicus briefs) are increasingly common and often concern public health and civil rights issues. For example, there were 136 amici filings in National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius, the case upholding the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act\u2019s health insurance mandate. Nearly 140 amicus briefs were filed in Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization, the case overturning Roe v. Wade (which received 23 amici filings 50 years earlier).Amicus briefs demonstrably influence case outcomes. During its 2019\u20132020 term, the Supreme Court cited amicus briefs in 65 percent of its opinions, with \u201cevery single justice cit[ing] a brief by professors in at least one of their opinions.\u201d The presence of a single amicus brief in support of a party\u2019s Supreme Court appeal significantly increases the likelihood that the Court will hear the case. Research shows that a larger number of amici filings in support of a party increases the likelihood of both a decision in that party\u2019s favor and of concurring and dissenting opinions.How Amicus Briefs Impact Court DecisionsAt their best, amicus briefs provide courts with scientific, technical, statistical, historical, and other real-world information to explain the consequences of decisions. Justices typically include language from amicus briefs to support or contextualize their opinions. For example, a brief by 547 public health scholars detailing the adverse health impacts of granting states authority over abortion policy was cited six times by the Dobbs dissent. Amicus briefs also offer narratives that humanize issues. Whole Woman\u2019s Health v. Hellerstedt, a 2016 case concerning state efforts to limit abortion access, had 45 amici filings from a variety of groups, including one from more than 100 women in the legal profession who had experienced abortions.It is critical that the information in amicus briefs is reliable, since courts, unlike agencies, lack the expertise to evaluate the quality of technical evidence. Loper Bright\u2019s directive that courts no longer defer to agencies increases the risk that courts will get important matters wrong. This can create confusion, as illustrated by the recent revision of a Supreme Court decision that mistook nitrogen oxide for nitrous oxide. The stakes in health care cases are frequently much higher; in overturning the FDA\u2019s approval of mifepristone as a safe and effective means of medication abortion, a trial court relied on a flawed study that was contained in an amicus brief authored by abortion opponents and subsequently retracted by its publisher.With courts now free to disregard agencies\u2019 expert interpretations, policymakers can expect to see the influence of amicus briefs grow. Consequently, it is crucial that people directly affected by health and civil rights laws have the opportunity to contribute their experience and expertise through amicus briefs to foster informed legal decision-making.

Collins, No. 23-713: This case involves the \u201cbenefit-of-the-doubt rule,\u201d a unique standard of proof the Department of Veterans Affairs (\u201cVA\u201d) applies to a claim for service-related disability benefits that tips the scales in a veteran\u2019s favor when \u201cthere is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence\u201d on any material issue. Petitioners applied for benefits and were dissatisfied with the VA\u2019s adverse determinations, which the Board of Veterans\u2019 Appeals reviewed de novo and denied. Those decisions were upheld by the U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (\u201cVeterans Court\u201d) on grounds that the Board\u2019s \u201capproximate balance\u201d determinations were not clearly erroneous. Petitioners appealed to the Federal Circuit, challenging the Veterans Court\u2019s legal interpretation of 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7261(b)(1), which requires the Veterans Court to \u201ctake due account\u201d of the VA\u2019s application of the \u201cbenefit-of-the-doubt rule.\u201d The Federal Circuit affirmed, rejecting Petitioners\u2019 argument that \u201ctake due account\u201d means the Veterans Court must review the entire record de novo and decide for itself whether the evidence is in \u201capproximate balance.\u201d In a 7-2 decision authored by Justice Thomas, the Court affirmed the Federal Circuit and held that the Veterans Court must review the VA\u2019s application of the \u201cbenefit-of-the-doubt rule\u201d the same way it would any other determination\u2014by reviewing legal issues de novo and factual issues for clear error. 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7261(a) defines the scope of Veterans Court review and empowers the Veterans Court to decide relevant questions of law; compel action unlawfully withheld or unreasonably delayed; and hold unlawful and set aside VA findings, conclusions, rules, and regulations that are arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law. Under 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7261(a)(4), the Veterans Court may set aside or reverse factual findings only if \u201cclearly erroneous,\u201d and the VA\u2019s determination that the evidence is in \u201capproximate balance\u201d is a predominantly factual determination reviewed only for clear error.

Congress legislates in broad terms and agencies fill in technical details on myriad issues, from how Medicaid eligibility is determined to how Medicare providers are paid to how new drugs are approved for market. A recent Supreme Court decision, Loper Bright v. Raimondo, changes the balance of power between courts and federal agencies when interpreting laws and reviewing regulations and also impacts \u201cfriend of the court\u201d (or amicus) briefs. This blog post considers amicus briefs\u2019 increased importance, and potential limitations, after the Loper Bright decision.Loper Bright\u2019s ImpactIn Loper Bright, the Supreme Court announced that \u201ccourts must exercise independent judgment in determining the meaning of statutory provisions,\u201d thereby overturning a 40-year-old precedent in Chevron U.S.A. v. Natural Resources Defense Council. Under Chevron, courts deferred to reasonable agency interpretations of ambiguous statutes.

          "task_beliefs": "My model of this case has stabilized, with the central uncertainty now sharply focused on a single, highly predictive external event. The previous influx of information from analogous cases has been fully integrated, and my predictive model is now awaiting a key signal.\n\n-   **Previous State:** My understanding evolved from a simple statutory conflict (CRSC vs. Barring Act) to a more nuanced clash of judicial philosophies. The government's strong textualist argument (\"Congress must be explicit to displace the Barring Act\") was countered by signals from the *Arellano* oral argument and the *Rudisill* decision, which suggested the Court might apply a softer, context-sensitive textualism in veterans' benefits cases. This evidence neutralized my slight lean towards the government, making the outcome a toss-up.\n-   **New Information (Internal Synthesis):** This observation is a moment of strategic consolidation, not new external evidence. It confirms that the insights from the previous update were correctly integrated. My belief state is stable. The core legal tension remains: **Will the Court apply its default \"clear statement\" rules rigidly, or will the pro-beneficiary context of veterans' law lead to a more flexible interpretation?**\n-   **Current Understanding of the Core Legal Tension:** My model now explicitly frames the prediction for *Soto* as being highly dependent on the outcome and reasoning in *Arellano v. McDonough*. Because *Arellano* features the identical structural argument from the government, its resolution will serve as the most powerful available predictor for *Soto*. The task has shifted from balancing abstract principles to awaiting a concrete, dispositive piece of evidence. My confidence in the \"toss-up\" assessment is high, precisely because the key variable is known but its value is not yet observed. The uncertainty is no longer diffuse; it is concentrated on the forthcoming *Arellano* opinion.",
          "design_beliefs": "My methodology has been significantly validated and refined. The focus has shifted from broad principle identification to targeted, high-utility information seeking based on a dynamic model of the legal landscape.\n\n-   **Previous State:** My design heuristics had evolved to include \"Acquire the Counter-Argument,\" \"Argument Prioritization\" (as a web, not a ladder), the \"Clear Statement Principle,\" \"Distinguishing Rights from Remedies,\" \"Contextual Canon Application,\" and, most recently, \"Analogous Pending Case Analysis.\" My research agenda was focused on tracking *Arellano* and deconstructing *Rudisill*.\n-   **New Information and Refinements:**\n    -   **Strong Validation of Recent Heuristics:** This internal reasoning step serves as powerful confirmation that the \"Analogous Pending Case Analysis\" heuristic is of paramount importance. The fact that my entire predictive model now hinges on the outcome of *Arellano* validates the strategy of prioritizing the search for contemporaneous, structurally similar cases. Likewise, the \"Contextual Canon Application\" heuristic remains central to understanding the core legal debate.\n    -   **New Heuristic - \"Synthesize and Strategize\":** The act of pausing to perform this internal monologue is itself a valuable strategic step. This observation leads to a new design principle: After a significant information gain, it is effective to pause, synthesize the new belief state, and explicitly identify the next most informative query. This \"Synthesize and Strategize\" step ensures that information-gathering is purposeful and efficient, preventing redundant searches and focusing resources on the action with the highest expected information gain. It formalizes the process of turning a complex belief state into a clear, actionable research plan.\n    -   **Confirmation of Research Agenda:** This observation confirms that the previously defined research agenda is the correct and most efficient path forward. The highest priority remains unchanged and is now held with greater confidence:\n        1.  **Primary Goal:** Obtain and analyze the final majority opinion in *Arellano v. McDonough*. This is the single most important action to resolve uncertainty in the task model (\u03b8).\n        2.  **Secondary Goal:** Continue the deep dive into the reasoning of *Rudisill v. McDonough* to understand the mechanics of pro-veteran textualist interpretation. This provides a crucial template for how a pro-Soto majority might construct its opinion."

          "task_beliefs": "My predictive model, previously stabilized around the forthcoming *Arellano* decision, has been significantly impacted by a major, unexpected shift in administrative law, even as the primary object of my search remains elusive.\n\n-   **Previous State:** My model had converged on the idea that the *Soto* case represents a clash between rigid textualism (the government's \"clear statement\" argument for the Barring Act) and a more context-sensitive interpretation influenced by the pro-veteran canon, as hinted at in *Rudisill*. The outcome of *Soto* was deemed highly contingent on the Supreme Court's reasoning in the structurally analogous *Arellano* case, making the prediction a toss-up pending that decision.\n-   **New Information (Search Failure & Serendipitous Discovery):** My targeted search for the *Arellano v. McDonough* opinion failed, meaning the central variable in my model remains unknown. The uncertainty that was previously concentrated on this single event persists. However, the search surfaced two other relevant pieces of information:\n    1.  **The Overturning of *Chevron* Deference:** The discovery of the *Loper Bright v. Raimondo* decision is a paradigm-shifting development for this case. *Loper Bright* abolishes the 40-year-old doctrine of deferring to a federal agency's reasonable interpretation of an ambiguous statute. Courts must now exercise their own \"independent judgment.\" This directly impacts the *Soto* case by removing a significant potential advantage for the government. The Navy's decision to apply the Barring Act is an agency interpretation that might have previously received deference. Now, the Court will decide the conflict between the CRSC statute and the Barring Act *de novo*. This elevates the importance of the textual and canonical arguments, such as the specific-statute-supersedes-the-general one, which favors Soto. This development likely shifts the odds slightly in Soto's favor, as it neutralizes a powerful tool the government could have relied upon.\n    2.  **The *Bufkin v. Collins* Decision:** The Court recently decided another veterans' case, *Bufkin*, holding 7-2 that the VA's factual findings under the \"benefit-of-the-doubt\" rule are reviewed for \"clear error,\" not de novo. This is a procedural ruling that favors the government's position. While the legal issue is distinct from *Soto*'s statutory conflict, it serves as a weak but important counter-signal to an unthinking application of the pro-veteran canon. It shows the Court is not a rubber stamp for veterans' claims and will enforce standard rules of judicial review, even when it results in a loss for the veteran. The broad, cross-ideological majority (Thomas, Roberts, Alito, Sotomayor, Kagan, Kavanaugh, Barrett) suggests this was not a contentious ideological question.\n-   **Current Understanding of the Core Legal Tension:** The core tension remains, but the legal framework has changed. It is no longer just about competing canons of interpretation but about how the Court will exercise its newly asserted \"independent judgment\" in a post-*Chevron* world. The central question is now: **In exercising its independent judgment on the statutory conflict between the CRSC and the Barring Act, will the Court prioritize the specific-over-general canon and the pro-veteran context, or will it enforce a strict \"clear statement\" rule to preserve the effect of a general statute of limitations?** The removal of deference slightly increases the probability of a pro-Soto outcome, but the *Bufkin* decision tempers that by showing the Court's pro-veteran leanings are not absolute. The outcome of *Arellano* is now even more critical as the first major indicator of how the Court will handle this exact type of veterans' benefits statute in this new legal environment.",
          "design_beliefs": "This observation, a mix of failure and serendipity, has prompted a significant evolution in my information-seeking methodology, highlighting the need for both robustness in targeted searches and awareness of broad legal shifts.\n\n-   **Previous State:** My design heuristics included \"Analogous Pending Case Analysis\" and \"Contextual Canon Application,\" with a research agenda focused squarely on obtaining the *Arellano* opinion and analyzing *Rudisill*. The \"Synthesize and Strategize\" heuristic had just been formulated to formalize the process of pausing to identify the next highest-value action.\n-   **New Information and Refinements:**\n    -   **Validation of \"Synthesize and Strategize\":** This heuristic worked perfectly, correctly identifying the *Arellano* opinion as the single most important piece of information to acquire. The failure was in the execution of the search, not the strategy.\n    -   **New Heuristic - \"Query Robustness and Fallback\":** The failure of a specific, targeted search for a document highlights a methodological weakness. A single query is too brittle. This leads to a new heuristic: When a high-priority search fails, automatically initiate fallback procedures. These could include broadening search terms, searching for secondary source analysis of the target document (e.g., news, blogs), or checking primary source databases (e.g., the court's docket) to verify the document's status. An information-seeking strategy must be resilient.\n    -   **New Heuristic - \"Monitor Foundational Legal Shifts\":** The discovery of the *Loper Bright* decision was accidental. Relying on luck is not a sustainable strategy. This reveals the need for a background process to track major doctrinal changes that have wide-ranging effects. This new heuristic involves periodically running broad queries for paradigm shifts in administrative and constitutional law (e.g., \"Supreme Court overturns precedent,\" \"new rules of statutory interpretation\"). This ensures my case-specific models are always situated within the correct, current legal landscape.\n    -   **Refinement of \"Contextual Canon Application\":** The *Loper Bright* decision fundamentally alters the weight and role of interpretive canons. In a post-*Chevron* world, canons are no longer just tools to resolve ambiguity after deference is considered; they are the primary instruments of the Court's \"independent judgment.\" My model must now treat the clash of canons as the central battleground, not a secondary consideration.\n    -   **Confirmation and Update of Research Agenda:** The core strategy is validated, but the tactical approach must be updated.\n        1.  **Primary Goal (Revised):** Determine the status of the *Arellano v. McDonough* decision. The next action should not be a simple repeat of the failed search but a more robust attempt using the \"Query Robustness and Fallback\" heuristic. Has it been decided? Is it still pending?\n        2.  **New Secondary Goal:** Actively research the implications of *Loper Bright v. Raimondo*. Understanding how courts, and specifically the Justices on this Court, are applying their \"independent judgment\" post-*Chevron* is now crucial context for any statutory interpretation case.\n        3.  **Tertiary Goal:** Log the data point from *Bufkin v. Collins*, noting the specific legal holding (standard of review) and the 7-2 majority coalition. This serves as a useful, albeit weak, prior for future veterans' cases."

Soto, \nand the class members he represents, are entitled to \nCombat-Related Special Compensation (\u201cCRSC\u201d)\u2014a \nmonthly benefit that Congress specifically authorized \nfor veterans who are disabled as a result of combat-\nrelated injuries incurred while serving in the United \nStates military. There is also no question that Cor-\nporal Soto is entitled to CRSC payments both going \nforward from the time his application was received and \nretroactively. The only question before this Court is \nwhether Corporal Soto may receive CRSC payments \nfor every month during which he was eligible under \nthe statute that authorizes CRSC, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1413a. \nThe government said no, contending that with respect \nto retroactive payments, Corporal Soto may obtain \nCRSC only for the six years before he applied. \nAlthough the CRSC statute imposes no time limit for \na veteran to apply for CRSC payments, the govern-\nment contends that the availability of CRSC payments \nis limited by a different statute, the Barring Act, 37 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 3702. The Barring Act is a gap-filling statute, \nauthorizing various agencies to \u201csettle\u201d an administra-\ntive claim against the United States\u2014i.e., to adminis-\ntratively determine whether the claim is valid and the \namount due\u2014in the event that no \u201c[]other law\u201d author-\nizes settlement of the claim. Id. \u00a7 3702(a). If a claim is \nsettled under the Barring Act, then it is subject to the \nBarring Act\u2019s six-year statute of limitations. Id. \n\u00a7 3702(b). But the Barring Act has no application to \nclaims for CRSC, because the CRSC statute authorizes \nsettlement of such claims. \nSpecifically, the CRSC statute authorizes the Secre-\ntaries of the military departments to determine both \nthe validity of claims for CRSC and the amount owed \n\n2 \n \nto eligible veterans\u2014all that is entailed in claims set-\ntlement. The Secretary concerned is directed to con-\nsider a veteran\u2019s application for CRSC under CRSC-\nspecific \u201cprocedures and criteria\u201d prescribed by the De-\npartment of Defense\u2014and thereby determine whether \nthe veteran is eligible for (and thus has a valid claim \nto) CRSC. 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1413a(d). The Secretary con-\ncerned is further directed to \u201cdetermine[]\u201d the monthly \namount owed to an eligible veteran using the process \nset forth in subsection (b). Id. \u00a7 1413a(a), (b). Because \nthe CRSC statute authorizes the Secretary concerned \nto determine the validity of a claim to CRSC and the \namount due, that statute specifically authorizes settle-\nment of claims like Corporal Soto\u2019s to CRSC\u2014and the \ngap-filling Barring Act accordingly has no application. \nThe judgment below should be reversed. \nDECISIONS BELOW  \nThe opinion of the Federal Circuit is reported at Soto \nv. United States, 92 F.4th 1094 (Fed. Cir. 2024), and \nreproduced at Pet. App. 1a\u201319a.

App. 45a.  \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nA. \nCombat-Related Special Compensation \n1. On December 2, 2002, Congress enacted the CRSC \nstatute to recognize and additionally compensate a se-\nlect and particularly deserving group of uniformed ser-\nvices retirees. The CRSC statute is unique in both \nwhom it serves and how it operates. In most cases, \nCongress prohibits simultaneous receipt of military re-\ntirement pay and Department of Veterans Affairs \n(\u201cVA\u201d) benefits. Congress first barred concurrent re-\nceipt of both military retirement pay and veteran\u2019s dis-\nability pension in 1891. Congressional Research Ser-\nvice, Concurrent Receipt of Military Retired Pay and \nVeteran Disability: Background and Issues for Con-\ngress (June 22, 2023), available at https://crsre-\nports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R40589/18 at 5. That \nprohibition remained in place until 1944, when Con-\ngress eased the prohibition by allowing retired mili-\ntary personnel to waive part of their retirement pay to \nreceive veteran\u2019s disability compensation. Act of May \n27, 1944, ch. 209, 58 Stat. 230, 230\u201331. This change \nwas modest, allowing some retirees to draw at least a \npartial disability benefit, which is nontaxable. Id.; 26 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 104(a)(4) & (b)(2)(D). But still, the law prohib-\nited concurrent receipt of both benefit types because it \nrequired any moneys received from veteran\u2019s disability \n\n4 \n \ncompensation to be subtracted from any retirement \nfunds received. Act of May 27, 1944, ch. 209, 58 Stat. \n230, 230\u201331. Hoping for better, veterans and advocacy \ngroups pushed for a change in law to allow receipt of \nall or some of both payments. \nIn 1999, Congress partially heeded that call. The \n1999 statute, Special Compensation for Severely Disa-\nbled Military Retirees, relaxed the prohibition on du-\nplicate benefits (also called concurrent receipt) by al-\nlowing veterans with at least 20 years of military ser-\nvice and a VA service-connected disability rated at 70 \npercent or higher to receive some monthly retirement \nbenefit. See Nat\u2019l Def. Authorization Act for Fiscal \nYear 2000, Pub. L. No. 106-65, \u00a7 658(a)(1), 113 Stat. \n512, 668\u201369 (1999). While this statute represented \nprogress, both the number of persons eligible and the \namount of compensation were minimal: the monthly \nbenefit maxed out at $300 and was available only to \nthe most severely disabled veterans. Id. \nCongress\u2019s enactment of the CRSC statute a few \nyears later represented a sea change. The program in-\ntroduced a higher cash benefit, closer to what concur-\nrent receipt would provide. However, in implementing \nthis change, Congress still saw fit to limit the benefit \nto a select group of military retirees whose service \nwrought some of the greatest sacrifices.1  \nA provision of the Bob Stump National Defense Au-\nthorization Act of 2003, the CRSC statute authorized \n \n1 Congress also enacted Concurrent Retirement and Disability \nPay (\u201cCRDP\u201d) in 2004, which allows longevity military retirees to \nreceive both military retired pay and VA disability compensation. \nNat\u2019l Def. Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2004, Pub. L. No. 108-\n136, \u00a7 641(a), 117 Stat. 1392, 1511\u201314 (2003). A veteran cannot \nreceive both CRSC and CRDP; if a veteran qualifies for both pay-\nments, the default payment will be the higher of the two.  \n\n5 \n \ncompensation to military retirees who either (1) sus-\ntained a disability that is \u201cattributable to an injury for \nwhich the member was awarded the Purple Heart\u201d and \nis assigned at least a 10% disability rating by the VA; \nor (2) had a disability rated at least 60% by the VA re-\nsulting from involvement in armed conflict, hazardous \nservice, duty simulating war, or through an instru-\nmentality of war. Bob Stump Nat\u2019l Def. Authorization \nAct for Fiscal Year 2003, Pub. L. No. 107-314, \u00a7 636, \n116 Stat. 2458, 2574\u201376 (2002) (codified as amended \nat 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1413a(e)). Since its inception, Congress \nhas amended and expanded the CRSC statute to pro-\nvide benefits to thousands of additional veterans with \ncombat-related disabilities.  \nAt first, the statute limited eligibility for CRSC to \nlongevity retirees (those who completed at least \ntwenty years of service). Pub. L. No. 107-314, \u00a7 636; 10 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 1413a(c)(1). The 2004 NDAA removed the \n60% disability rating threshold for longevity retirees. \nPub. L. No. 108-136, \u00a7 642. The 2008 NDAA further \nexpanded CRSC eligibility to anyone medically re-\ntired, including retirees with fewer than twenty years \nof service, effective January 1, 2008. Nat\u2019l Def. Author-\nization Act for Fiscal Year 2008, Pub. L. No. 110-181, \n122 Stat. 3 (2008).  \nTo be clear, the CRSC statute does not end the re-\nquirement that a retiree\u2019s military retired pay be re-\nduced by the amount of their total VA disability com-\npensation. 38 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5304, 5305. Instead, CRSC \nbeneficiaries receive \u201cspecial compensation\u201d: a partic-\nular, Congressionally authorized payment to select re-\ntirees that is in addition to whatever amount the vet-\neran is authorized to receive in military retirement \nand VA disability compensation. In contrast, a medical \nretiree who sustained a service-connected but non-\ncombat-related injury would not be eligible for such \n\n6 \n \nspecial compensation. Additionally, unlike some other \nmilitary or VA benefits, CRSC is available only to the \nveteran from the time the veteran becomes eligible to \nthe end of the veteran\u2019s life\u2014it does not extend to sur-\nviving spouses or other heirs. See 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1413a(a), \n(c).  \nThe CRSC statute stands apart as the first and only \nform of compensation that distinguishes veterans \nwounded as a result of combat. Neither VA service-\nconnected disability compensation nor longevity re-\ntirement nor medical retirement requires the veteran \nbeneficiary to suffer injury related to combat. See, e.g., \n38 U.S.C. \u00a7 1110 (VA basic entitlement\u2014time of war); \n38 U.S.C. \u00a7 1131 (VA basic entitlement\u2014peacetime); \n10 U.S.C. \u00a7 633 (longevity retirement for certain offic-\ners not recommended for promotion with 28 years of \nactive commissioned service); 10 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7  1201\u20131204 \n(military medical retirement); 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1293 (lon-\ngevity retirement for warrant officers with 20 years of \nservice); 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 12731 (reservist longevity retire-\nment). As such, the statute carves out unique benefits \nto a tailored group of retired service members whom \nlegislators singled out as particularly deserving. See \n148 Cong. Rec. S10,859 (daily ed. Nov. 13, 2002) (state-\nment of Sen. Harry Reid) (stating that the injured vet-\nerans aided by CRSC \u201cdeserve it as much as anyone \ndeserves anything in the world\u201d); id. at S10,860 (state-\nment of Sen. John Warner) (CRSC is \u201ccompensation \nfor those veterans we deemed formed that category de-\nserving of added funds\u201d). \n2. The CRSC statute provides: \u201cThe Secretary con-\ncerned shall pay to each eligible combat-related disa-\nbled uniformed services retiree who elects benefits un-\nder this section a monthly amount for the combat-re-\nlated disability of the retiree determined under \n\n7 \n \nsubsection (b).\u201d 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1413a(a).2 The statute goes \non to define how the Secretary concerned is to deter-\nmine which applicants for CRSC are eligible and how \nmuch each eligible applicant is to be paid. \nThe statutory term \u201celigible combat-related disabled \nuniformed services retiree\u201d is defined in subsection (c) \nto mean a service member who both is entitled to re-\ntired pay and has a \u201ccombat-related disability.\u201d The \nterm \u201ccombat-related disability\u201d is defined in subsec-\ntion (e) to mean a disability that is attributable to an \ninjury for which the member was awarded the Purple \nHeart or that was incurred in armed conflict, through \nan instrumentality of war, under conditions simulat-\ning war or other hazardous activity. Whether an appli-\ncant is eligible under the statutory definitions is to be \n\u201cconsidered\u201d by the Secretary concerned according to \n\u201cprocedures and criteria\u201d that the Secretary of Defense \nhas prescribed. Id. \u00a7 1413a(d); see also Joint Appendix \n(\u201cJA\u201d) 77\u2013107 (January 2004 Guidance promulgated \nby the Department of Defense pursuant to subsection \n(d));  JA 108\u2013113 (January 2008 Supplemental Guid-\nance promulgated by Department of Defense pursuant \nto subsection (d)). \nThe amount to be paid to eligible applicants is set \nforth in subsection (b) of the statute. That provision \ndetails how to determine \u201cthe monthly amount to be \npaid an eligible combat-related disabled uniformed \nservices retiree under subsection (a) for any month.\u201d \n10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1413a(b)(1). The CRSC statute thus pro-\nvides the framework for the Secretary of each military \nbranch to determine which veterans are eligible, and \n \n2 \u201cSecretary concerned\u201d is defined to mean the Secretary of the \nArmy, Navy, Air Force, or Homeland Security, depending on \nwhich branch of the armed forces is concerned. 10 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 101(a)(9). \n\n8 \n \nhow much CRSC is due to a particular eligible veteran, \nbased on the criteria and classifications provided in \nthe statute. \nCRSC is not automatic. Eligible retirees must apply \nfor the special compensation through the military \nbranch from which they retired, and must document \nthat they meet eligibility criteria. In particular, an ap-\nplicant must document not only that they have a disa-\nbility rating of 10 percent or greater, but also that their \ndisability stems from one of the qualifying  situations \nthat are classified as \u201ccombat-related.\u201d See 10 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1413a(c), (e);  JA 87\u201390 (Guidance, Federal Circuit \nDeferred Appendix \u201cAppx.\u201d 101\u201303). For example, if a \nveteran claims entitlement to CRSC based on disabil-\nity due to an injury for which the veteran was awarded \nthe Purple Heart, the veteran must provide \u201cdocumen-\ntary information that there is a sufficient causal rela-\ntionship between the disability and the injury for \nwhich a Purple Heart was awarded to conclude that \nthe disability is attributable to such injury.\u201d JA 87 \n(Guidance, Appx. 101).3 Disabilities that a veteran \n \n3 As examples of the documentation required, the Army\u2019s web-\nsite on \u201cCRSC Frequently Asked Questions\u201d states:  \nSend to CRSC copies of DD 214/215s, as well as All VA-rating \ndecisions including the VA letter, the VA rating decisions and \nthe VA code sheets, Medical Records from MTF or VA physi-\ncians only, unless referred to a private physician by the VA, \nother typical official documents include, service medical rec-\nord extracts, military personnel file extracts, milita\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n28: 20250303172223807_COS20Soto20Final.json (score: 0.452)\nCERTIFICATE OF SERVICE \nNo. 24-320 \nSIMON A.

Soto, \nand the class members he represents, are entitled to \nCombat-Related Special Compensation (\u201cCRSC\u201d)\u2014a \nmonthly benefit that Congress specifically authorized \nfor veterans who are disabled as a result of combat-\nrelated injuries incurred while serving in the United \nStates military. There is also no question that Cor-\nporal Soto is entitled to CRSC payments both going \nforward from the time his application was received and \nretroactively. The only question before this Court is \nwhether Corporal Soto may receive CRSC payments \nfor every month during which he was eligible under \nthe statute that authorizes CRSC, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1413a. \nThe government said no, contending that with respect \nto retroactive payments, Corporal Soto may obtain \nCRSC only for the six years before he applied. \nAlthough the CRSC statute imposes no time limit for \na veteran to apply for CRSC payments, the govern-\nment contends that the availability of CRSC payments \nis limited by a different statute, the Barring Act, 37 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 3702. The Barring Act is a gap-filling statute, \nauthorizing various agencies to \u201csettle\u201d an administra-\ntive claim against the United States\u2014i.e., to adminis-\ntratively determine whether the claim is valid and the \namount due\u2014in the event that no \u201c[]other law\u201d author-\nizes settlement of the claim. Id. \u00a7 3702(a). If a claim is \nsettled under the Barring Act, then it is subject to the \nBarring Act\u2019s six-year statute of limitations. Id. \n\u00a7 3702(b). But the Barring Act has no application to \nclaims for CRSC, because the CRSC statute authorizes \nsettlement of such claims. \nSpecifically, the CRSC statute authorizes the Secre-\ntaries of the military departments to determine both \nthe validity of claims for CRSC and the amount owed \n\n2 \n \nto eligible veterans\u2014all that is entailed in claims set-\ntlement. The Secretary concerned is directed to con-\nsider a veteran\u2019s application for CRSC under CRSC-\nspecific \u201cprocedures and criteria\u201d prescribed by the De-\npartment of Defense\u2014and thereby determine whether \nthe veteran is eligible for (and thus has a valid claim \nto) CRSC. 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1413a(d). The Secretary con-\ncerned is further directed to \u201cdetermine[]\u201d the monthly \namount owed to an eligible veteran using the process \nset forth in subsection (b). Id. \u00a7 1413a(a), (b). Because \nthe CRSC statute authorizes the Secretary concerned \nto determine the validity of a claim to CRSC and the \namount due, that statute specifically authorizes settle-\nment of claims like Corporal Soto\u2019s to CRSC\u2014and the \ngap-filling Barring Act accordingly has no application. \nThe judgment below should be reversed. \nDECISIONS BELOW  \nThe opinion of the Federal Circuit is reported at Soto \nv. United States, 92 F.4th 1094 (Fed. Cir. 2024), and \nreproduced at Pet. App. 1a\u201319a. The opinion of the \nSouthern District of Texas granting summary judg-\nment for petitioner is unreported, but is available at \n2021 WL 7287022, and reproduced at Pet. App. 32a\u2013\n37a. \nJURISDICTION  \nThe judgment of the court of appeals was entered on \nFebruary 12, 2024. Pet. App. 20a. The Federal Circuit \ndenied petitioner\u2019s timely petition for rehearing en \nbanc on June 20, 2024. Pet. App. 40a. The petition for \n\n3 \n \nwrit of certiorari was filed on September 18, 2024. This \nCourt has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254(1). \nSTATUTORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED  \nThe relevant statutory and regulatory provisions are \nreproduced at Pet. App. 42a\u201347a. The statute address-\ning Combat-Related Special Compensation, 10 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1413a, is reproduced at Pet. App. 42a. The Barring \nAct, 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3702, is reproduced at Pet. App. 45a.  \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nA. \nCombat-Related Special Compensation \n1. On December 2, 2002, Congress enacted the CRSC \nstatute to recognize and additionally compensate a se-\nlect and particularly deserving group of uniformed ser-\nvices retirees. The CRSC statute is unique in both \nwhom it serves and how it operates. In most cases, \nCongress prohibits simultaneous receipt of military re-\ntirement pay and Department of Veterans Affairs \n(\u201cVA\u201d) benefits. Congress first barred concurrent re-\nceipt of both military retirement pay and veteran\u2019s dis-\nability pension in 1891. Congressional Research Ser-\nvice, Concurrent Receipt of Military Retired Pay and \nVeteran Disability: Background and Issues for Con-\ngress (June 22, 2023), available at https://crsre-\nports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R40589/18 at 5. That \nprohibition remained in place until 1944, when Con-\ngress eased the prohibition by allowing retired mili-\ntary personnel to waive part of their retirement pay to \nreceive veteran\u2019s disability compensation. Act of May \n27, 1944, ch. 209, 58 Stat. 230, 230\u201331. This change \nwas modest, allowing some retirees to draw at least a \npartial disability benefit, which is nontaxable. Id.; 26 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 104(a)(4) & (b)(2)(D). But still, the law prohib-\nited concurrent receipt of both benefit types because it \nrequired any moneys received from veteran\u2019s disability \n\n4 \n \ncompensation to be subtracted from any retirement \nfunds received. Act of May 27, 1944, ch. 209, 58 Stat. \n230, 230\u201331. Hoping for better, veterans and advocacy \ngroups pushed for a change in law to allow receipt of \nall or some of both payments. \nIn 1999, Congress partially heeded that call. The \n1999 statute, Special Compensation for Severely Disa-\nbled Military Retirees, relaxed the prohibition on du-\nplicate benefits (also called concurrent receipt) by al-\nlowing veterans with at least 20 years of military ser-\nvice and a VA service-connected disability rated at 70 \npercent or higher to receive some monthly retirement \nbenefit. See Nat\u2019l Def. Authorization Act for Fiscal \nYear 2000, Pub. L. No. 106-65, \u00a7 658(a)(1), 113 Stat. \n512, 668\u201369 (1999). While this statute represented \nprogress, both the number of persons eligible and the \namount of compensation were minimal: the monthly \nbenefit maxed out at $300 and was available only to \nthe most severely disabled veterans. Id. \nCongress\u2019s enactment of the CRSC statute a few \nyears later represented a sea change. The program in-\ntroduced a higher cash benefit, closer to what concur-\nrent receipt would provide. However, in implementing \nthis change, Congress still saw fit to limit the benefit \nto a select group of military retirees whose service \nwrought some of the greatest sacrifices.1  \nA provision of the Bob Stump National Defense Au-\nthorization Act of 2003, the CRSC statute authorized \n \n1 Congress also enacted Concurrent Retirement and Disability \nPay (\u201cCRDP\u201d) in 2004, which allows longevity military retirees to \nreceive both military retired pay and VA disability compensation. \nNat\u2019l Def. Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2004, Pub. L. No. 108-\n136, \u00a7 641(a), 117 Stat. 1392, 1511\u201314 (2003). A veteran cannot \nreceive both CRSC and CRDP; if a veteran qualifies for both pay-\nments, the default payment will be the higher of the two.  \n\n5 \n \ncompensation to military retirees who either (1) sus-\ntained a disability that is \u201cattributable to an injury for \nwhich the member was awarded the Purple Heart\u201d and \nis assigned at least a 10% disability rating by the VA; \nor (2) had a disability rated at least 60% by the VA re-\nsulting from involvement in armed conflict, hazardous \nservice, duty simulating war, or through an instru-\nmentality of war. Bob Stump Nat\u2019l Def. Authorization \nAct for Fiscal Year 2003, Pub. L. No. 107-314, \u00a7 636, \n116 Stat. 2458, 2574\u201376 (2002) (codified as amended \nat 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1413a(e)). Since its inception, Congress \nhas amended and expanded the CRSC statute to pro-\nvide benefits to thousands of additional veterans with \ncombat-related disabilities.  \nAt first, the statute limited eligibility for CRSC to \nlongevity retirees (those who completed at least \ntwenty years of service). Pub. L. No. 107-314, \u00a7 636; 10 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 1413a(c)(1). The 2004 NDAA removed the \n60% disability rating threshold for longevity retirees. \nPub. L. No. 108-136, \u00a7 642. The 2008 NDAA further \nexpanded CRSC eligibility to anyone medically re-\ntired, including retirees with fewer than twenty years \nof service, effective January 1, 2008. Nat\u2019l Def. Author-\nization Act for Fiscal Year 2008, Pub. L. No. 110-181, \n122 Stat. 3 (2008).  \nTo be clear, the CRSC statute does not end the re-\nquirement that a retiree\u2019s military retired pay be re-\nduced by the amount of their total VA disability com-\npensation. 38 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5304, 5305. Instead, CRSC \nbeneficiaries receive \u201cspecial compensation\u201d: a partic-\nular, Congressionally authorized payment to select re-\ntirees that is in addition to whatever amount the vet-\neran is authorized to receive in military retirement \nand VA disability compensation. In contrast, a medical \nretiree who sustained a service-connected but non-\ncombat-related injury would not be eligible for such \n\n6 \n \nspecial compensation. Additionally, unlike some other \nmilitary or VA benefits, CRSC is available only to the \nveteran from the time the veteran becomes eligible to \nthe end of the veteran\u2019s life\u2014it does not extend to sur-\nviving spouses or other heirs. See 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1413a(a), \n(c).  \nThe CRSC statute stands apart as the first and only \nform of compensation that distinguishes veterans \nwounded as a result of combat. Neither VA service-\nconnected disability compensation nor longevity re-\ntirement nor medical retirement requires the veteran \nbeneficiary to suffer injury related to combat. See, e.g., \n38 U.S.C. \u00a7 1110 (VA basic entitlement\u2014time of war); \n38 U.S.C. \u00a7 1131 (VA basic entitlement\u2014peacetime); \n10 U.S.C. \u00a7 633 (longevity retirement for certain offic-\ners not recommended for promotion with 28 years of \nactive commissioned service); 10 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7  1201\u20131204 \n(military medical retirement); 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1293 (lon-\ngevity retirement for warrant officers with 20 years of \nservice); 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 12731 (reservist longevity retire-\nment). As such, the statute carves out unique benefits \nto a tailored group of retired service members whom \nlegislators singled out as particularly deserving. See \n148 Cong. Rec. S10,859 (daily ed. Nov. 13, 2002) (state-\nment of Sen. Harry Reid) (stating that the injured vet-\nerans aided by CRSC \u201cdeserve it as much as anyone \ndeserves anything in the world\u201d); id. at S10,860 (state-\nment of Sen. John Warner) (CRSC is \u201ccompensation \nfor those veterans we deemed formed that category de-\nserving of added funds\u201d). \n2. The CRSC statute provides: \u201cThe Secretary con-\ncerned shall pay to each eligible combat-related disa-\nbled uniformed services retiree who elects benefits un-\nder this section a monthly amount for the combat-re-\nlated disability of the retiree determined under \n\n7 \n \nsubsection (b).\u201d 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1413a(a).2 The statute goes \non to define how the Secretary concerned is to deter-\nmine which applicants for CRSC are eligible and how \nmuch each eligible applicant is to be paid. \nThe statutory term \u201celigible combat-related disabled \nuniformed services retiree\u201d is defined in subsection (c) \nto mean a service member who both is entitled to re-\ntired pay and has a \u201ccombat-related disability.\u201d The \nterm \u201ccombat-related disability\u201d is defined in subsec-\ntion (e) to mean a disability that is attributable to an \ninjury for which the member was awarded the Purple \nHeart or that was incurred in armed conflict, through \nan instrumentality of war, under conditions simulat-\ning war or other hazardous activity. Whether an appli-\ncant is eligible under the statutory definitions is to be \n\u201cconsidered\u201d by the Secretary concerned according to \n\u201cprocedures and criteria\u201d that the Secretary of Defense \nhas prescribed. Id. \u00a7 1413a(d); see also Joint Appendix \n(\u201cJA\u201d) 77\u2013107 (January 2004 Guidance promulgated \nby the Department of Defense pursuant to subsection \n(d));  JA 108\u2013113 (January 2008 Supplemental Guid-\nance promulgated by Department of Defense pursuant \nto subsection (d)). \nThe amount to be paid to eligible applicants is set \nforth in subsection (b) of the statute. That provision \ndetails how to determine \u201cthe monthly amount to be \npaid an eligible combat-related disabled uniformed \nservices retiree under subsection (a) for any month.\u201d \n10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1413a(b)(1). The CRSC statute thus pro-\nvides the framework for the Secretary of each military \nbranch to determine which veterans are eligible, and \n \n2 \u201cSecretary concerned\u201d is defined to mean the Secretary of the \nArmy, Navy, Air Force, or Homeland Security, depending on \nwhich branch of the armed forces is concerned. 10 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 101(a)(9). \n\n8 \n \nhow much CRSC is due to a particular eligible veteran, \nbased on the criteria and classifications provided in \nthe statute. \nCRSC is not automatic. Eligible retirees must apply \nfor the special compensation through the military \nbranch from which they retired, and must document \nthat they meet eligibility criteria. In particular, an ap-\nplicant must document not only that they have a disa-\nbility rating of 10 percent or greater, but also that their \ndisability stems from one of the qualifying  situations \nthat are classified as \u201ccombat-related.\u201d See 10 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1413a(c), (e);  JA 87\u201390 (Guidance, Federal Circuit \nDeferred Appendix \u201cAppx.\u201d 101\u201303). For example, if a \nveteran claims entitlement to CRSC based on disabil-\nity due to an injury for which the veteran was awarded \nthe Purple Heart, the veteran must provide \u201cdocumen-\ntary information that there is a sufficient causal rela-\ntionship between the disability and the injury for \nwhich a Purple Heart was awarded to conclude that \nthe disability is attributable to such injury.\u201d JA 87 \n(Guidance, Appx. 101).3 Disabilities that a veteran \n \n3 As examples of the documentation required, the Army\u2019s web-\nsite on \u201cCRSC Frequently Asked Questions\u201d states:  \nSend to CRSC copies of DD 214/215s, as well as All VA-rating \ndecisions including the VA letter, the VA rating decisions and \nthe VA code sheets, Medical Records from MTF or VA physi-\ncians only, unless referred to a private physician by the VA, \nother typical official documents include, service medical rec-\nord extracts, military personnel file extracts, military person-\nnel data system printouts, prior military disability board de-\ncisions, line of duty determinations, safety mishap (accident) \nreports, next of kin notification (Western Union Telegrams), \ncasualty reports, morning reports, duty status reports, or-\nder/travel voucher, official documents not in the military per-\nsonnel record, etc. Be sure to retain a copy for Soldier's rec-\nords. \nU.S. Army Hum. Res. Command, CRSC Frequently Asked Ques-\ntions \nFAQs, \n\n9 \n \ncannot demonstrate are combat-related \u201cwill not be \nconsidered in determining eligibility for CRSC or the \namount of CRSC payable.\u201d JA 89 (Guidance, Appx. \n102). This process distinguishes CRSC from other ben-\nefits programs like CRDP, for which one need not af-\nfirmatively apply.  \nThe CRSC statute does not limit the number of \nmonths for which an applicant may obtain payment. It \ndoes not state that CRSC will be paid only prospec-\ntively, or that it will be paid for a limited number of \nmonths for which the applicant was eligible before his \nor her CRSC application was submitted. To the con-\ntrary, subsection (b) specifies the amount to be paid to \neligible applicants \u201cfor any month.\u201d  \nB. Corporal Soto\u2019s service and injury \nCorporal Simon A. Soto served honorably in the \nUnited States Marine Corps from 2000 to 2006. Pet. \nApp. 22a. During that time, he served two tours of ac-\ntive combat duty in Operation Iraqi Freedom. JA 15 \n\u00b6 53. During his first tour, Corporal Soto\u2019s unit served \nin Mortuary Affairs. Id. \u00b6 54. Mortuary Affairs opera-\ntions oversee the collection and dignified transfer of \nthe remains of fallen soldiers. Those serving in an \noverseas Mortuary Affairs unit, as Corporal Soto did, \nare responsible for entering into combat zones to re-\ntrieve their fallen comrades, identifying them, and \npreparing them for reunification with their surviving \nloved ones. Joint Publ\u2019n 4-06, Mortuary Affairs  xiii-xiv \n(2011), https://irp.fas.org/doddir/dod/jp4_06.pdf. Re-\ntrieval is a risky operation, as it frequently occurs \nwhile combat is ongoing or has just ended, when dan-\nger from mines, explosives, or enemy combatants \n \nhttps://www.hrc.army.mil/content/CRSC%20Fre-\nquently%20Asked%20Questions%20FAQs (last visited Mar. 1, \n2025). \n\n10 \n \nremains particularly high. Members of the unit place \ntheir own bodies in harm\u2019s way to ensure that no sol-\ndier, living or deceased, is left behind on the battle-\nfield. As such, service in a Mortuary Affairs unit is \nsimultaneously physically dangerous and emotionally \ntaxing. Studies show that mortuary affairs personnel \nexperience some of the highest rates of Post-Traumatic \nStress Disorder (\u201cPTSD\u201d) in the service, due to the \ngruesome nature of the assignment, the emotional link \nbetween the soldier and the fallen, and the persistent \nphysical threats endured by the member of the unit. \nMichael Sledge, Soldier Dead: How We Recover, Iden-\ntify, Bury, and Honor Our Military Fallen 61 (2005), \nhttps://www.jstor.org/stable/10.7312/sled13514.6.  \nCorporal Soto\u2019s experience reflects this. While de-\nployed, Corporal Soto witnessed daily atrocities as he \nwent out to \u201csearch for, recover, and process the re-\nmains\u201d of war casualties. JA 15 \u00b6 54. Whenever his \nMortuary Affairs unit received a report of casualties, \nmembers of the unit would go out and place any recov-\nered remains in plastic or body bags and transport \nthem to the military base for identification and reloca-\ntion to the United States. Id. Corporal Soto recalls one \nmission in which he and other service members re-\ntrieved \u201cover 300 pieces of five or seven soldiers\u201d who \nhad been killed. Id. at 15\u201316 \u00b6 55. As Corporal Soto \nrelated,  \u201cit wasn\u2019t really easy to identify who and it \nwas just literally chunks and pieces of flesh that we \nwere processing.\u201d Id.  \nWhile serving, Corporal Soto began having suicidal \nthoughts, vivid nightmares, and difficulty concentrat-\ning as a result of his experiences in Mortuary Affairs. \nJA 16 \u00b6 56. After deployment, Corporal Soto found ad-\njustment to civilian life incredibly difficult. Id. His \nphysicians documented the correlation between his \n\n11 \n \ndistressing combat experiences in Iraq and his later \ndiagnosis of PTSD. Id. \u00b6 57. \nBecause Corporal Soto\u2019s PTSD rendered him \u201cunfit\u201d \nto continue his service, he was placed on the Tempo-\nrary Disability Retirement List (\u201cTDRL\u201d), and medi-\ncally retired from the Marine Corps on April 28, 2006. \nPet. App. 22a. This entitled him to military retirement \npay. Id. In recognition of his honorable service, the mil-\nitary awarded Corporal Soto numerous medals and \ncommendations, including the Army Commendation \nMedal, which is awarded to members of the Armed \nForces who \u201cdistinguish themselves by heroism, out-\nstanding achievement, or meritorious service\u201d; the \nNavy \nand \nMarine \nCorps \nAchievement \nMedal, \n\u201cawarded for meritorious service or achievement in ei-\nther combat or noncombat based on sustained perfor-\nmance or specific achievement of a superlative na-\nture;\u201d the Iraqi Campaign Medal, and the Global War \non Terrorism Service Medal. JA 15 \u00b6 52; https://veter-\nanmedals.army.mil/home/us-army-medals-award-\nbadges-ribbon-and-attachments-information/us-army-\nservice-campaign-medals-and-foreign-awards-infor-\nmation; https://www.marines.mil/Combat-Awards/Ar-\nticle/1831663/navy-marine-corps-achievement-\nmedal/. Subsequently, Corporal Soto was removed \nfrom the TDRL and given permanent disability retire-\nment, which continued his entitlement to military re-\ntirement pay. Id. at 16 \u00b6 58.  \nCorporal Soto then sought service-connected disabil-\nity benefits from the VA for his PTSD. Id. \u00b6 59. In June \n2009, the VA issued a rating decision awarding him a \ndisability rating of 50 percent for his PTSD (effective \nApril 26, 2006), followed by a rating of 30 percent (ef-\nfective November 1, 2006), and then a rating of 100 \npercent (effective December 31, 2008). Id. A rating of \n100 percent means the VA concluded Corporal Soto \n\n12 \n \nexhibited \u201cTotal occupational and social impairment \ndue to such symptoms as: gross impairment in thought \nprocesses or communication; persistent delusions or \nhallucinations; grossly inappropriate behavior; persis-\ntent danger of hurting self or others; intermittent ina-\nbility to perform activities of daily living (including \nmaintenance of minimal personal hygiene); disorien-\ntation to time or place; memory loss for names of close \nrelatives, own occupation, or own name.\u201d  38 C.F.R. \u00a7 \n4.130 (General Rating Formula for Mental Disorders, \nDC 9411 (PTSD)). \nAgainst this backdrop of devastating symptoms, in \nJune 2016, Corporal Soto petitioned the Navy seeking \nCRSC based on his combat-related PTSD. Pet. App. \n22a. In October 2016, the Navy affirmed that Corporal \nSoto was eligible, finding that his PTSD was a combat-\nrelated disability and awarding him CRSC. Id. How-\never, the Navy assigned a CRSC effective date of July \n2010, Pet. App. 4a, notwithstanding the fact that Cor-\nporal Soto met all of the CRSC eligibility criteria as of \nJanuary 1, 2008\u2014the effective date of the 2008 NDAA, \nwhich as explained above, had extended CRSC to med-\nical retirees such as Corporal Soto. JA 17 \u00b6 61. See 10 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 1413a(b)(3)(B). As a result, the Secretary of \nthe Navy awarded him only six years of retroactive \nCRSC (from July 2010 to June 2016), not eight-and-\none-half years of retroactive CRSC (from January \n2008 until June 2016). JA 17 \u00b6\u00b6 61\u201362.  \nThe Secretary of the Navy explained its restriction \nof Corporal Soto\u2019s payment as follows:  \nCRSC is subject to the 6-year statute of \nlimitations United States Code (U.S.C.) \n31, Section 3702(b). In order to receive \nthe full retroactive CRSC entitlement, \nyou must file your CRSC claim within 6 \nyears of any VA rating decision that could \n\n13 \n \npotentially make you eligible for CRSC or \nthe date you became entitled to retired \npay, whichever is most recent. If you file \nyour claim more than 6 years after initial \neligibility, you will be restricted to 6 \nyears of any retroactive entitlement.  \nJA 11 \u00b6 35 (brackets in original). Through the Secre-\ntaries of the military branches, the United States has \nused this six-year statute of limitations policy to pay \nno more than six years of retroactive CRSC to thou-\nsands of other United States military combat veterans \nentitled to CRSC.  \nC. \nThe proceedings below \nOn March 2, 2017, Corporal Soto brought this action \nin the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of \nTexas on behalf of a class of U.S. military veterans \nwho, like him, are eligible for CRSC due to significant \ndisabilities they incurred through combat injuries. The \nsuit asserted a single claim pursuant to 10 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1413a (referred to above as the \u201cCRSC statute\u201d) \nbased on the United States\u2019 \u201cnationwide and unlawful \npolicy to pay no more than six years of retroactive \nCRSC \u201d JA 1. The proposed nationwide class consisted \nof:  \n[f]ormer service members of the \nUnited States Army, Navy, Marine \nCorps, Air Force, or Coast Guard \nwhose CRSC applications under 10 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 1413a were granted, but \nwhose amount of CRSC payment was \nlimited by Defendant\u2019s application of \nthe statute of limitations contained in \n31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3702 and have a claim \nless than $10,000. \n\n14 \n \nPet. App. 31a. On August 31, 2017, the District Court \ndenied the government\u2019s motion for judgment on the \npleadings. Order Denying Def\u2019s. Mot. For J. on the \nPleadings, No. 1:17-cv-00051 (S.D. Tex. Aug. 31, 2017), \nDkt. 39. The court first recognized that \u201c[e]ntitlement \nto CRSC is set forth by statute in 10 U.S.C. \u00a71413a, \nwhich grants the Secretary concerned the authority to \npay an \u2018eligible combat-related disabled uniformed ser-\nvices retiree\u2019 a monthly amount of benefits for the com-\nbat-related disability.\u201d Id. at 5. It then reasoned, \u201c[t]he \nCourt is aware of no legal basis to conclude that Con-\ngress intended any other statute to govern CRSC \nclaims.\u201d Id. In particular, the Barring Act could not su-\npersede the mechanism for awarding CRSC within the \nCRSC statute. While the Barring Act is \u201ca \u2018general act\u2019 \napplicable to a multitude of uniformed service mem-\nbers\u2019 claims,\u201d the CRSC statute is a \u201c\u2018specific act\u2019 stat-\nute,\u201d the detailed provisions of which \u201ctake[] prece-\ndence over\u201d the Barring Act. Id.  \nThe District Court later certified the proposed class \non February 11, 2019. Pet. App. 31a. The government \nidentified 9,108 former service members whose retro-\nactive CRSC had been limited by application of the \nBarring Act.4 JA 71. \nThe District Court granted summary judgment to \nCorporal Soto on December 16, 2021. Pet. App. 38a\u2013\n39a. The court held that the CRSC statute separately \nauthorizes settlement of claims for CRSC \u201cbecause it \ndefines eligibility for CRSC, helps explain the amount \nof benefits and instructs the Secretary of Defense to \n \n4 The number of class members described above is based on in-\nformation provided by the government pulled from the list of \nCRSC recipients as of August 5, 2019. The number of affected vet-\nerans has certainly increased in the more than five years since \nthat information was collected.  \n\n15 \n \nprescribe procedures and criteria for individuals to ap-\nply for CRSC.\u201d Pet. App. 35a\u201336a. Accordingly, the \ncourt held that the CRSC statute is \u201canother law,\u201d dis-\nplacing the Barring Act and its six-year statute of lim-\nitations. Pet. App. 35a. The court entered final judg-\nment in favor of Corporal Soto and the class, finding \nthe government liable to the veterans for compensa-\ntion withheld when applying the Barring Act. Pet. \nApp. 38a\u201339a.  \nOn appeal, the Federal Circuit reversed the District \nCourt in a split decision. Pet. App. 11a. The majority \nheld that the Barring Act was not displaced\u2014and that \nits statute of limitations applied to limit the CRSC \navailable to Corporal Soto and the class\u2014based on its \nconclusion that the CRSC statute \u201cconveys no\u201d settle-\nment authority. Id. at 7a. According to the Federal Cir-\ncuit, in order to displace the Barring Act a statute \n\u201cmust explicitly grant an agency or entity the author-\nity to settle claims\u201d using \u201cspecific language,\u201d which \nthe majority stated \u201cwill typically be done by the use \nof the term \u2018settle\u2019.\u201d Id. at 6a\u20137a. Because the CRSC \nstatute does not \u201cmention[] settlement,\u201d the Federal \nCircuit concluded that \u201cit only establishes who may be \neligible for CRSC payments, not how claimants can \nhave those claims settled.\u201d Id.  \nThe majority separately held that \u201c[w]ithout specific \nlanguage authorizing the Secretary of Defense to settle \na claim[,] . . . the CRSC statute cannot displace the \nBarring Act, unless another statute provides a \u2018spe-\ncific\u2019 provision setting out the period of recovery.\u201d Pet. \nApp. 7a. The majority concluded that \u201cthe CRSC stat-\nute does not meet either of those requirements.\u201d Id.  \nJudge Reyna dissented. Pet. App. 12a. First, he ex-\nplained, \u201cthere is no dispute in this case\u201d that \u201c\u2018[s]et-\ntling a claim\u2019 . . . means administratively determining \nthe validity of the demand for money against the \n\n16 \n \ngovernment and the amount of money due.\u201d Id. at 12a\u2013\n13a. Here, he wrote, \u201cthe CRSC statute permits the \ngovernment to administratively determine the validity \nof a veteran\u2019s demand for CRSC, as well as the amount \nof CRSC due to the veteran in retroactive and future \nmonthly compensation. In light of these provisions, the \nBarring Act does not apply.\u201d Id. at 13a\u201314a.  \nIn particular, the statute \u201cdefines eligible retirees,\u201d \nthus allowing for the determination of \u201cwhether they \nhave a right to demand money under the statute\u2014that \nis, whether they have a \u2018claim.\u2019\u201d Pet. App. 14a. Fur-\nther, \u201cthe CRSC statute describes how the Secretary \nmust determine the \u2018monthly amount to be paid.\u2019\u201d Id. \nat 15a (quoting 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1413a(b)(1)). \u201cBy these \ncommon and plain terms, the CRSC statute specifies \nthe \u2018settlement\u2019 of a \u2018claim\u2019 against the government. It \ntherefore takes precedence over the Barring Act.\u201d Id. \nat 15a\u201316a. \nJudge Reyna went on to criticize the majority\u2019s de-\nmand for \u201c\u2018specific language\u2019\u201d before a statute could be \nread to authorize claims settlement as \u201cunprece-\ndented\u201d: \n[T]he long-understood meaning of \u201csettling\u201d a \n\u201cclaim\u201d against the government includes no such \nlimitations. Raising these new requirements, the \nmajority also raises the bar to a new and unprec-\nedented standard for what a statute must state to \nsupersede the Barring Act. Although a statute in-\nvolving resolution of conflict may \u201ctypically\u201d use \nthe words \u201csettle\u201d and \u201cclaim,\u201d the majority does \nnot explain why this phrasing should be \u201ctypical\u201d \nfor statutes that involve a more general, remedial, \nadministrative determination of eligibility for \nmoney from the government and the amount due. \nAnd the majority\u2019s alternative requirement\u2014that \na statute state a \u201cspecific\u201d period of recovery\u2014\n\n17 \n \nrequires a level of specificity in statutory lan-\nguage that finds no support in our canons of stat-\nutory interpretation.    \nPet. App. 18a.  \n\u201c[I]n rendering this decision,\u201d Judge Reyna wrote, \n\u201cthe majority denies benefits to a highly-deserving \nclass of veterans seeking compensation granted by \nstatute for combat-related injuries incurred in service \nto this country.\u201d Pet. App. 19a. \nSUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT  \nBefore an administrative claim for compensation \nfrom the United States may be paid, the claim must be \n\u201csettled.\u201d This Court has long held, and the parties \nagree, that to \u201csettle\u201d a claim in this context means to \nadministratively determine whether the claim is valid \nand how much is owed. As the entity with ultimate \ncontrol over use of U.S. funds, Congress determines \nwhich agency within the U.S. government has author-\nity to settle which claims.  \nIn the founding era, when far fewer administrative \nclaims were pursued against the United States, Con-\ngress lodged settlement authority exclusively with the \nTreasury Department. But in the subsequent two cen-\nturies, as the number of statutes authorizing ad-min-\nistrative claims against the government has prolifer-\nated, settlement authority has been broadly delegated, \nwith numerous agencies deemed authorized to settle \nvarious claims. In addition, Congress has enacted the \nBarring Act to act as a gap-filler: If a claim is pre-\nsented and no other statute authorizes a specific \nagency to settle it, then the Barring Act kicks in by \ndefault, and details which agency should settle which \ntype of claim.  \n\n18 \n \nThe question before the Court is whether the statute \ndirecting the Secretaries of the military branches to \npay CRSC to eligible veterans authorizes settlement of \nCRSC claims\u2014or, in the alternative, whether such \nclaims are subject to the Barring Act (and its six-year \nstatute of limitations) by default. The text of the CRSC \nmakes the answer plain. That statute on its face au-\nthorizes the Secretary concerned to determine \nwhether a veteran is eligible for (and thus has a valid \nclaim to) CRSC, and what amount of CRSC should be \npaid. The Barring Act has no application here. \nFirst, as to determining eligibility, the statute states \nthat \u201ca disabled uniformed services retiree may apply \nto the Secretary of a military department to be consid-\nered to be an eligible combat-related disabled uni-\nformed services retiree,\u201d with the Secretary\u2019s \u201cconsid-\neration\u201d of the application to be conducted according to \nCRSC-specific \u201cprocedures and criteria\u201d to be pre-\nscribed by the Secretary of Defense. 10 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1413a(d). Upon consideration of the claimant\u2019s appli-\ncation, the Secretary concerned is directed to \u201cpay\u201d \nCRSC \u201cto each eligible combat-related disabled uni-\nformed services retiree.\u201d Id. \u00a7 1413a(a). As to deter-\nmining the amount owed, the statute states that the \nSecretary concerned shall pay \u201ca monthly amount for \nthe combat-related disability of the retiree determined \nunder subsection (b).\u201d Id. Subsection (b), in turn, de-\ntails precisely how the Secretary is to make the requi-\nsite \u201cdetermination.\u201d Id. \u00a7 1413(b)(1) (titled \u201cdetermi-\nnation of monthly amount\u201d). \nIn short, the plain statutory text directs the Secre-\ntary concerned to determine both the validity of a vet-\neran\u2019s claim to CRSC and the amount owed. The CRSC \nstatute therefore confers settlement authority, and the \nBarring Act does not apply. \n\n19 \n \nThe Federal Circuit reached a different conclusion \nby applying a novel, anti-settlement canon of construc-\ntion. According to that court, a statute should not be \nconstrued to grant settlement authority unless it uses \n\u201cspecific language\u201d (\u201ctypically . . . the term \u2018settle,\u2019\u201d ac-\ncording to the Federal Circuit), or imposes an explicit \nstatute of limitations. Pet. App. 7a. Neither require-\nment holds water. \nFirst, statutory history and this Court\u2019s precedents \nconfirm that settlement authority exists whenever an \nagency has authority to administratively determine \nthe validity and amount of a claim, regardless of the \nparticular terms used. No authority supports the Fed-\neral Circuit\u2019s \u201cspecific language\u201d requirement\u2014and \nthis Court\u2019s case law teaches away from interpreting \nstatutes based on the presence or absence of \u201cmagic \nwords.\u201d To the extent any canon of construction was \napplied here, the Federal Circuit should have applied \nthe veterans canon\u2014which was widely accepted, and \npresumably known to Congress, at the time the CRSC \nstatute was enacted.  \nAdditionally, the statutory text squarely refutes the \nFederal Circuit\u2019s conclusion that (because it does not \nuse the word \u201csettle\u201d) the CRSC statute \u201conly estab-\nlishes who may be eligible for CRSC payments.\u201d Pet. \nApp. 7a. The statute on its face authorizes the Secre-\ntary concerned to determine eligibility and amount \ndue, and to pay CRSC claims\u2014distinguishing it from \nother military compensation statutes that, unlike the \nCRSC statute, address only an individual\u2019s entitle-\nment to pay, and not the Secretary\u2019s authority to settle \nclaims and make payment on them. \nFinally, the Federal Circuit\u2019s suggestion that the \nCRSC statute must impose a statute of limitations to \ndisplace the Barring Act is inconsistent with the text \nof the Barring Act. The text makes clear that the \n\n20 \n \nBarring Act\u2014all of it, including its statute of limita-\ntions\u2014does not apply to a claim if \u201canother law\u201d pro-\nvides for settlement, without regard to whether the \nother law also includes a statute of limitations. 31 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 3702(a)\u2013(b). Indeed, the absence of a statute \nof limitations on CRSC claims makes perfect sense \ngiven how the CRSC statute operates. CRSC becomes \navailable only after a veteran is retired from the mili-\ntary, and is awarded only during the veteran\u2019s life-\ntime, and not to the veteran\u2019s heirs. Further, interest \nis not available on retroactive CRSC payments. Given \nthese constraints\u2014and the obstacles that disabling \ncombat-related injuries may pose to a veteran\u2019s ability \nto complete the CRSC application process\u2014it is unsur-\nprising that Congress chose to make CRSC payments \navailable for the entire period of a veteran\u2019s eligibility. \nThe decision below should be reversed. \nARGUMENT  \nI. \nTHE CRSC STATUTE AUTHORIZES SET-\nTLEMENT OF CLAIMS FOR CRSC AND \nTHUS DISPLACES THE BARRING ACT. \nThe Federal Circuit held that claims for CRSC must \nbe settled under the Barring Act\u2014and are accordingly \nsubject to the Barring Act\u2019s six-year statute of limita-\ntions\u2014based on its conclusion that the CRSC statute \ndoes not authorize settlement of claims for CRSC. Pet. \nApp. 7a. The Federal Circuit was incorrect. Settlement \nauthority exists if a statute authorizes an agency to \nadministratively determine the validity of a claim and \nthe amount due. The CRSC statute authorizes the Sec-\nretaries of the military departments to administra-\ntively determine both whether an applicant is eligible \nfor (i.e., has a valid claim to) CRSC, and what amount \nof CRSC the applicant is entitled to. Because the \nCRSC statute authorizes settlement of CRSC claims, \n\n21 \n \nit is \u201canother law\u201d that displaces the Barring Act, see \n31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3702(a), and neither the Barring Act\u2019s set-\ntlement procedures nor its statute of limitations ap-\nplies to claims for CRSC. \nA. An agency has settlement authority if a \nstatute authorizes it to administratively \ndetermine the validity of a claim and the \namount due. \n1. Congress has widely authorized agen-\ncies to settle claims against the United \nStates. \nThe Constitution grants Congress exclusive author-\nity to \u201cpay the Debts\u201d of the United States, and to \u201cdis-\npose of and make all needful Rules and Regulations \nrespecting the Territory or other Property belonging to \nthe United States.\u201d U.S. Const. art. I, \u00a7 8, cl. 1; id. art. \nIV \u00a7 3, cl. 2. Further, \u201cNo Money shall be drawn from \nthe Treasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations \nmade by Law.\u201d Id., art. I, \u00a7 9, cl. 7. Accordingly, for a \nclaimant to obtain payment from the United States, \nCongress must have authorized both acceptance of the \nclaim and payment using appropriated funds. See, e.g., \nUnited States v. Corliss Steam-Engine Co., 91 U.S. \n321, 322 (1875) (power to settle and pay claims on be-\nhalf of the United States is \u201climited by the legislation \nof Congress\u201d); U.S. Gov\u2019t Accountability Off., GAO-08-\n978SP, Principles of Federal Appropriations Law 14-\n2\u201314-3 (3d ed. 2008) (\u201cGAO Red Book\u201d) (\u201c[C]laims \nagainst the United States may not be approved, \u2026 and \nappropriated funds (or other resources) may not be \nused to satisfy claims against the United States, un-\nless there is constitutional and/or statutory authority \nthat both allows the claim to be pursued and makes \nfunds (or other resources, available for that purpose.\u201d). \n\n22 \n \nThe first step in this process\u2014determining that a \nclaimant has a valid claim against the United States, \nand what amount is owed on such claim\u2014is often (but \nnot exclusively) referred to as \u201csettlement.\u201d \u201cThe word \n\u2018settlement,\u2019 in connection with public transactions \nand accounts, has been used from the beginning to de-\nscribe administrative determination of the amount \ndue.\u201d Ill. Sur. Co. v. United States, 240 U.S. 214, 219 \n(1916). Specifically, the authority \u201cto settle and adjust\u201d \na claim against the United States is the authority \u201cto \ndetermine upon the validity of\u201d the claim and the \namount owed on it. Id. at 219\u201320 (emphasis omitted) \n(quoting Cooke v. United States, 91 U.S. 389, 399 \n(1875)).5 And this Court has made clear that settlement \nof a claim is a distinct step that precedes payment of a \nclaim. See id. at 218\u201319 (statutory term \u201csettlement\u201d \nof claims could not be interpreted to \u201cdenote payment\u201d \nof claims); Cooke, 91 U.S. at 399\u2013400 (assistant-treas-\nurer was authorized to make payments using appro-\npriated funds, but had \u201cno authority to settle and ad-\njust, that is to say, to determine upon the validity of, \nany claim against the government\u201d).  \nNotably, the term \u201csettlement,\u201d when used to denote \nadministrative processing of a claim, does not have the \nsame meaning as when that term is used in litigation. \n\u201c[T]he term \u2018settlement\u2019 in the litigation context means \ncompromise.\u201d Off. of Gen. Counsel, GAO, Principles of \nFederal Appropriations Law 11-6 (1st ed. 1982). But \nthe authority to administratively  \nsettle and adjust claims does not . . . include the \n \n5 A \u201cclaim\u201d in this context is \u201ca right to demand money from the \nUnited States . . . which can be presented by the claimant to some \ndepartment or officer of the United States for payment, or may be \nprosecuted in the court of claims.\u201d Hobbs v. McLean, 117 U.S. 567, \n575 (1886). \n\n23 \n \nauthority to compromise claims. In the context of \npayment claims, the rationale for this is simply \nthat a claim determined to be valid should be paid \nin full. Likewise, public funds should not be used \nto pay any part of a claim determined not to be \nvalid. Thus, the authority to compromise a given \nclaim against the United States depends on the \nexistence of statutory authority above and beyond \nthe authority to \u201csettle and adjust\u201d claims of that \ntype. \nId. (citations omitted). This long-established use of the \nterm \u201csettlement\u201d\u2014to mean administrative determi-\nnation of the validity of a claim and amount due\u2014con-\ntinues to this day. See, e.g., Adams v. Hinchman, 154 \nF.3d 420, 422 (D.C. Cir. 1998) (per curiam) (citing Ill. \nSur. and holding: \u201cto settle a claim means to adminis-\ntratively determine the validity of that claim\u201d) (quot-\ning Off. of Gen. Counsel, GAO, Principles of Federal \nAppropriations Law 11-6); Paige v. United States, 159 \nFed. Cl. 383, 386 (2022); Devlin v. Berry, 26 F. Supp. \n3d 74, 79 (D.D.C. 2014). Relevant here, \u201cthere is no dis-\npute in this case regarding what it means to \u2018settle\u2019 \nsuch a claim.\u201d Pet. App. 12a (Reyna, J., dissenting); see \nalso Brief for Appellant at 29-30, Soto v. United States, \nNo. 2022\u20132011 (Fed. Cir. Oct. 12, 2022); Pet. App. 3a \nn.1. \nIn the earliest days of the republic, Congress re-\ntained authority to settle claims, and itself \u201cadjudi-\ncate[d] each individual money claim against the \nUnited States.\u201d Off. of Pers. Mgmt. v. Richmond, 496 \nU.S. 414, 430 (1990). As the nation grew and the need \nfor timely processing of claims increased following the \nRevolutionary War, Congress in 1789 established the \nTreasury Department, and granted it authority to \n\u201csettle\u201d and \u201caudit\u201d accounts on behalf of the United \nStates. An Act to Establish the Treasury Department, \n\n24 \n \nch. XII, 1 Stat. 65, 66\u201367 (1789). Shortly thereafter, in \n1817, Congress expanded this delegation, legislating \nthat \u201call claims and demands whatever, by the United \nStates or against them, and all accounts whatever, in \nwhich the United States are concerned, either as debt-\nors or as creditors, shall be settled and adjusted in the \nTreasury Department.\u201d An Act to Provide for the \nPrompt Settlement of Public Accounts, ch. XLV, \u00a7 2, 3 \nStat. 366, 366 \u00a7 2 (1817).   \nIn this early period, reviewing and paying claims \nagainst the United States was \u201cmuch simpler,\u201d be-\ncause Congress had not yet authorized many claims, \nand \u201cthe possibility of obtaining redress for claims \nagainst the government was limited.\u201d GAO Red Book \nat 14-20\u201314-21. In the subsequent two centuries, how-\never, \u201c[t]he law has undergone a sea change,\u201d with the \nnumber of statutes authorizing claims against the gov-\nernment proliferating. Id. at 14\u201321. \u201cNow, there are \nmany statutes that, in varying degrees of detail, waive \nsovereign immunity and bestow authority to adminis-\ntratively entertain claims.\u201d Id.  \nIndeed, unlike Congress\u2019s early legislation decreeing \nthat the Treasury Department should settle \u201call \nclaims,\u201d Congress has in subsequent years dispersed \nsettlement authority across the federal government. In \nthe U.S. Code, there are \u201cmany authorities available \ntoday to administratively settle claims against the fed-\neral government,\u201d by numerous federal agencies. Id.; \nid. (offering \u201ca brief sampler\u201d of statutes authorizing \nvarious agencies to settle claims). \nAnd Congress is not alone: judicial interpretation \nand agency practice have similarly spread settlement \nauthority more widely. For example, this Court, in \nCorliss Steam-Engine, concluded that the Secretary of \nthe Navy\u2019s statutory authority to enter into contracts \nto acquire naval machinery necessarily encompassed \n\n25 \n \nthe power to settle claims for payment under such con-\ntracts\u2014including claims for partial performance. \u201cAs, \nin making the original contracts, he must agree upon \nthe compensation to be made for their entire perfor-\nmance, it would seem, that, when those contracts are \nsuspended by him, he must be equally authorized to \nagree upon the compensation for their partial perfor-\nmance.\u201d 91 U.S., at 322\u201323. The Court reasoned, \u201cit \nwould be of serious detriment to the public service if \nthe power of the head of the Navy Department did not \nextend to providing for all such possible contingencies \nby modification or suspension of the contracts, and set-\ntlement with the contractors.\u201d Id. at 323. \nAdditionally, after Congress created the General Ac-\ncounting Office and by statute transferred to that \nagency the authority to settle claims of the United \nStates, Budget and Accounting Act of 1921, Pub. L. No. \n67-13, \u00a7 305, 42 Stat. 20, 24 (1921), the GAO adopted \nthe practice of delegating the settlement function to \nother agencies. Rather than settle claims itself, \n\u201cGAO\u2019s policy was to leave initial settlement of a claim \nto the agency from whose activities the claims arose.\u201d \n42 Stat. at 14\u201324; see also 4 C.F.R. \u00a7 31.4 (1998) (\u201cA \nclaimant should file his or her claim with the adminis-\ntrative department or agency out of whose activities \nthe claim arose. The agency shall initially adjudicate \nthe claim.\u201d).  \n2. The Barring Act confers nonexclu-\nsive settlement authority and is dis-\nplaced by any \u201c[]other law\u201d authoriz-\ning claims settlement. \nGiven this history, it is unsurprising that the cur-\nrent Barring Act\u2014a much-amended statutory de-\nscendant of the 1817 law directing the Treasury to set-\ntle all claims, GAO Red Book at 14-5 n.28\u2014is explicit \nthat no agency has exclusive authority to settle claims \n\n26 \n \nagainst the United States. Instead, at this point in the \nnation\u2019s history, the Barring Act is no more than a \n\u201cgeneral background provision[]\u201d that is \u201cinapplicable\u201d \nwhere any other statute authorizes claims settlement. \nHernandez v. Dep\u2019t of Air Force, 498 F.3d 1328, 1332 \n(Fed. Cir. 2007). \nSpecifically, the Barring Act provides that, \u201c[e]xcept \nas provided in this chapter or another law, all claims \nof or against the United States Government shall be \nsettled as follows.\u201d 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3702(a) (emphasis \nadded). Subject to the \u201canother law\u201d carveout, the Bar-\nring Act then assigns settlement authority as to claims \ninvolving specified topics to the Secretary of Defense, \nthe Director of the Office of Personnel Management, \nand the Administrator of General Services, respec-\ntively, with the Director of the Office of Management \nand Budget assigned to \u201csettle claims not otherwise \nprovided for by this subsection or another provision of \nlaw.\u201d Id. \u00a7 3702(a)(1)\u2013(4).  \nCongress reiterated the nonexclusive nature of set-\ntlement authority in the legislation enacting the cur-\nrent version of the Barring Act. There, Congress ex-\nplained that the settlement function previously lodged \nwith the GAO would be transferred to the Director of \nOMB, but expressly provided that \u201c[t]he Director may \ndelegate any such function, in whole or in part, to any \nother agency or agencies if the Director determines \nthat such delegation would be cost-effective or other-\nwise in the public interest.\u201d Legislative Branch Appro-\npriations Act, Pub. L. No. 104-53, \u00a7 211, 109 Stat. 514, \n535 (1995). And, pursuant to this statutory authority,  \nOMB has delegated its residual settlement authority \nto various agencies, depending on the nature of the \nclaim. See Memorandum from Comptroller Gen., B-\n275605, Transfer of Claims Settlement and Related \n\n27 \n \nAdvance Decisions, Waivers, and Other Functions 1\u20132 \n(Mar. 17, 1997), https://perma.cc/89K2-DBKA. \nThe Barring Act also sets forth a time limit for \nclaims settled under that statute: \u201cA claim against the \nGovernment presented under this section . . .  must be \nreceived by the official responsible under subsection \n(a) for settling the claim or by the agency that conducts \nthe activity from which the claim arises within 6 years \nafter the claim accrues.\u201d 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3702(b)(1). As the \nprovision states expressly, this statute of limitations \napplies only to claims \u201cpresented under this section\u201d\u2014\ni.e., claims settled pursuant to the authority conferred \nin the Barring Act. Additionally, even for claims set-\ntled under the Barring Act, the six-year limit is dis-\nplaced if \u201canother law\u201d provides otherwise. Id. \n\u00a7 3702(b)(1)(A).  \nIn sum, under current law, any agency may settle a \nclaim against the United States if a statute authorizes \nthe agency to administratively determine the validity \nof the claim and the amount due on it. To the extent \nno other statute authorizes settlement of a particular \nclaim, the Barring Act acts as a gap-filler, supplying \ngeneral settlement authority to various agencies. \nWhen a claim is settled under the general authority \nconferred in the Barring Act, instead of under specific \nsettlement authority conferred in \u201canother law,\u201d the \nclaim is subject to the Barring Act\u2019s default six-year \nstatute of limitations. \nB. The CRSC statute confers authority to \nsettle and pay claims for CRSC. \nThe CRSC statute, on its face, grants authority to \nthe Secretaries of the military departments to settle \nclaims for CRSC. Because claims for CRSC are \nproperly settled under the specific settlement author-\nity granted in the CRSC statute, that statute \n\n28 \n \nconstitutes \u201canother law\u201d that displaces the Barring \nAct. Accordingly, the Barring Act\u2019s provisions\u2014includ-\ning the six-year statute of limitations in \u00a7 3702(b)\u2014do \nnot apply to CRSC claims. \n1. The CRSC statute authorizes the Sec-\nretary concerned to administratively \ndetermine the validity of a veteran\u2019s \nclaim for CRSC and the amount due. \nThe CSRC Statute begins as follows: \n(a) Authority.\u2014 \nThe Secretary concerned shall pay to each eligible \ncombat-related disabled uniformed services re-\ntiree who elects benefits under this section a \nmonthly amount for the combat-related disability \nof the retiree determined under subsection (b). \n10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1413a(a).  \nValidity. Subsection (a) grants the Secretary con-\ncerned \u201c[a]uthority\u201d to administratively determine the \nvalidity of a claim for CRSC, in that it directs the Sec-\nretary concerned to pay CSRC only to an \u201celigible com-\nbat-related disabled uniformed services retiree who \nelects benefits under this section.\u201d Id. (emphasis \nadded.) And the statute elsewhere confirms that it is \nthe Secretary concerned who is authorized to adminis-\ntratively determine the eligibility of an applicant elect-\ning CRSC benefits (and hence, a claim\u2019s validity). \nEligibility is defined in subsection (c). That section, \ntitled \u201cEligible retirees,\u201d provides that \u201c[f]or purposes \nof this section, an eligible combat-related disabled uni-\nformed services retiree referred to in subsection (a) is \na member of the uniformed services who\u2014(1) is enti-\ntled to retired pay . . .; and (2) has a combat-related \ndisability.\u201d Id. \u00a7 1413a(c) \u201cCombat-related disability\u201d \nis defined in subsection (e) to mean a disability \n\n29 \n \n\u201cattributable to an injury for which the member was \nawarded the Purple Heart\u201d or that was incurred \u201cas a \ndirect result of armed conflict,\u201d \u201cwhile engaged in haz-\nardous service,\u201d \u201cin the performance of duty under con-\nditions simulating war,\u201d or \u201cthrough an instrumental-\nity of war.\u201d  \nSubsection (d), in turn, provides that it is the Secre-\ntary concerned who must \u201cconsider[]\u201d whether an ap-\nplicant for CRSC is \u201can eligible combat-related disa-\nbled uniformed services retiree\u201d under these defini-\ntions and details how that consideration is to be con-\nducted. Id. \u00a7 1413a(d). In particular, subsection (d) \nstates that \u201c[t]he Secretary of Defense shall prescribe \nprocedures and criteria under which a disabled uni-\nformed services retiree may apply to the Secretary of \na military department[6] to be considered to be an eli-\ngible combat-related disabled uniformed services re-\ntiree.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Thus, Congress expressly di-\nrected that whether an applicant electing CRSC bene-\nfits is \u201can eligible combat-related disabled uniformed \nservices retiree\u201d\u2014i.e., whether an applicant has a \nvalid claim to CRSC benefits\u2014is a matter to be \u201ccon-\nsidered\u201d by the Secretary concerned, according to \nCRSC-specific procedures to be established by the De-\npartment of Defense. In short, by directing the Secre-\ntary concerned to \u201cconsider\u201d whether an applicant is \neligible for CRSC benefits\u2014and to pay CRSC only to \neligible applicants\u2014the statute\u2019s plain text authorizes \nthe Secretary concerned to administratively determine \n \n6 \u201cSecretary of a military department\u201d refers to the Secretary \nof the Army, Navy, or Air Force. See 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 101(a)(8) (defin-\ning \u201cmilitary departments\u201d).

At each step, the Guidance issued under \nthe statute reiterates that the administrative determi-\nnation of the validity of an applicant\u2019s claim is to be \nperformed by the relevant Military Department. Id. at \n80 (\u201cApplications for CRSC will be processed by the re-\nspective Military Department under these guide-\nlines.\u201d); id. at 87 (\u201c[T]he Military Departments will de-\ntermine whether the member\u2019s disabilities are qualify-\ning combat-related disabilities as prescribed below.\u201d); \nid.

Subsection (a) also authorizes the Sec-\nretary concerned to administratively determine the \namount of CRSC owed on an eligible veteran\u2019s claim. \nSubsection (a) states that the Secretary concerned \nshall pay \u201ca monthly amount for the combat-related \ndisability of the retiree determined under subsection \n(b).\u201d 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1413a(a) (emphasis added).

In sum, the statute authorizes the Secre-\ntary to \u201cdetermine[]\u201d the amount due to an eligible vet-\neran\u2014and directs how to make that determination. \n \n7 10 U.S.C. ch. 61 governs retirement of service members who \nhave been determined to be unfit for duty due to disability. See \nDep\u2019t of Def., Military Compensation: Disability Retirement, \nhttps://tinyurl.com/ykyuek45 (last visited Feb. 28, 2025). \n\n32 \n \n2. The CRSC statute separately author-\nizes payment of CRSC. \nFinally, providing further confirmation that subsec-\ntion (a)\u2019s grant of \u201cauthority\u201d to the Secretary con-\ncerned confers settlement authority is that the statute \nseparately authorizes the payment of CRSC claims \nfrom specific appropriated funds. As noted above, set-\ntlement of claims and payment of claims are separate \nfunctions that must be separately authorized. See Ill. \nSur., 240 U.S. at 218\u201319 (statutory term \u201csettlement\u201d \nof claims could not be interpreted to \u201cdenote payment\u201d \nof claims); see also GAO Red Book at 14\u201329 (\u201cJust be-\ncause a claim is approved through the claims settle-\nment process does not necessarily mean that it can or \nwill be paid. For the claim to be paid, appropriated \nfunds must be available for that purpose.\u201d).  \nConsistent with this longstanding understanding, \nthe CRSC statute confers authority not only to settle \nclaims, as described above, but also to make payment \non settled claims using particular appropriated funds. \nSubsection (h) sets forth the \u201cSource of payments\u201d of \nCRSC: Payments to veterans of the Army, Navy, Air \nForce, Marine Corps, or Space Force \u201cshall be paid \nfrom the Department of Defense Military Retirement \nFund,\u201d while payments for any other member \u201cshall be \npaid out of funds appropriated for pay and allowances \npayable by the Secretary concerned for that fiscal \nyear.\u201d 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1413a(h). \nThis separate provision for payment of CRSC is tell-\ning. It is consistent with typical legislative practice to \nprovide for both settlement of claims and payment of \nclaims using appropriated funds in the same statute. \nIn the words of the GAO Red Book, \u201cWhen considering \nwhat appropriation to use to pay an administratively \nsettled claim, the first place to look is the statute au-\nthorizing the settlement.\u201d GAO Red Book at 14\u201345. \n\n33 \n \nWhere, as with the CRSC statute, a statute \u201cgoverning \nspecific types of claims contain[s] detailed provisions \ngoverning the payment of those claims,\u201d id. at 14\u201344, \nthen the statute establishes a self-contained compen-\nsation scheme\u2014here, providing for both administra-\ntive determination of the validity of CRSC claims and \namount due thereon, as well as the ultimate payment \nof settled claims. \n* * * * * \nBecause the CRSC statute authorizes the Secretary \nconcerned to administratively determine (a) whether \nan applicant is eligible for CRSC, and (b) how much \nCRSC the applicant is owed, the CRSC statute author-\nizes the Secretary concerned to settle claims for CRSC. \nThe CRSC statute is thus \u201canother law\u201d that displaces \nthe Barring Act. The Federal Circuit\u2019s contrary deci-\nsion was erroneous.  \nII. \nTHE TEST CREATED BY THE FEDERAL \nCIRCUIT IS INCORRECT AND SHOULD \nBE REJECTED.  \nThe Federal Circuit majority held that the Barring \nAct was not displaced\u2014and that its statute of limita-\ntions applied to limit the CRSC available to Corporal \nSoto and the class\u2014based on its conclusion that the \nCRSC statute \u201cconveys no\u201d settlement authority. Pet. \nApp. 7a. According to the Federal Circuit, in order to \ndisplace the Barring Act a statute \u201cmust explicitly \ngrant an agency or entity the authority to settle \nclaims\u201d using \u201cspecific language,\u201d which the majority \nstated \u201cwill typically be done by the use of the term \n\u2018settle.\u2019\u201d Id. at 6a\u20137a. Thus, rather than review the \nCRSC statute\u2019s provisions to determine whether it au-\nthorized claims settlement, the majority simply evalu-\nated whether the statute \u201cmention[s] settlement.\u201d Id. \nNot finding the word \u201csettle,\u201d the Federal Circuit \n\n34 \n \nconcluded that the CRSC statute \u201conly establishes who \nmay be eligible for CRSC payments, not how claimants \ncan have those claims settled.\u201d Id. The majority fur-\nther held that \u201c[w]ithout specific language,\u201d the CRSC \nstatute would need to \u201cprovide[] a \u2018specific\u2019 provision \nsetting out the period of recovery,\u201d a requirement the \nmajority said also was not satisfied. Id. \nThis two-part test disregards this Court\u2019s definition \nof \u201csettlement,\u201d imposes unjustified requirements on \nCongress, and otherwise lacks a basis in the law of \nstatutory interpretation. The Court should reject it. \nA. \nThere is no requirement that a statute use \nthe word \u201csettle\u201d to displace the Barring \nAct.  \n1. The Federal Circuit\u2019s \u201cspecific lan-\nguage\u201d requirement is inconsistent \nwith precedent. \nThe Federal Circuit\u2019s demand for \u201cspecial lan-\nguage\u201d addressing settlement finds no support in stat-\nutory history or case law. \nFirst, no authority supports the notion that the \nword \u201csettle\u201d must appear for a statute to confer set-\ntlement authority. While some statutes addressing \nclaims settlement use the term \u201csettle,\u201d others use dif-\nferent terms (such as \u201cadjust,\u201d \u201caudit,\u201d \u201cadjudicate,\u201d or \n\u201cdetermine\u201d) or confer authority to settle claims by au-\nthorizing conduct that encompasses claims settlement. \nThat is the upshot of this Court\u2019s decision in Corliss \nSteam-Engine. There, the Court acknowledged that \nthe power to settle claims \u201cis, of course, limited by the \nlegislation of Congress,\u201d but concluded that the Secre-\ntary of the Navy had legislative authority to settle a \nclaim for payment for partial performance on a manu-\nfacturing contract without regard to the presence or \n\n35 \n \nabsence of \u201cspecial language\u201d in the statute. 91 U.S. at \n322\u201323. Instead, the Court concluded that the requi-\nsite settlement authority existed because \u201cdischarge of \nthe duty devolving upon the secretary necessarily re-\nquires him to enter into numerous contracts,\u201d some of \nwhich would inevitably have to be suspended, and he \naccordingly was necessarily \u201cauthorized to agree upon \nthe compensation for their partial performance.\u201d Id. In \nshort, the Secretary\u2019s authority to settle claims was \nfound through a functional analysis of the authorities \ngranted to him in the statute\u2014not simply by asking \nwhether the statute \u201cmention[ed] settlement\u201d as the \nFederal Circuit majority did here. Pet. App. 7a.  \nSimilarly, in Hernandez, the Federal Circuit ad-\ndressed whether the Barring Act applied to settlement \nof claims brought under the Uniformed Services Em-\nployment and Reemployment Rights Act (\u201cUSERRA\u201d), \n38 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 4301\u20134333. 498 F.3d at 1330\u201331. The \nFederal Circuit concluded that settlement of claims \nunder USERRA is governed exclusively by 38 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 4324(c), which provides that \u201c[t]he Merit Systems \nProtection Board shall adjudicate any complaint.\u201d Ac-\ncording to the Federal Circuit, this language\u2014which \nrefers neither to \u201csettlement\u201d nor \u201cclaims\u201d\u2014was suffi-\ncient to displace the Barring Act. 480 F.3d at 1331.  \nAnd in McNeil v. United States, 78 Fed. Cl. 211 \n(2007), the Court of Federal Claims held that a series \nof statutes each could serve as \u201canother law\u201d providing \nthe Secretary of the Treasury with authority to settle \nclaims of or against the United States, displacing the \nBarring Act. Id. at 221. Among other things, the \nMcNeil court pointed to 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6402(a), which pro-\nvides that \u201c[i]n the case of any overpayment [of taxes], \nthe Secretary, within the applicable period of limita-\ntions, may credit the amount of such overpayment . . .  \nagainst any liability in respect of an internal revenue \n\n36 \n \ntax on the part of the person who made the overpay-\nment and shall . . .  refund any balance to such person.\u201d \nJust like the CRSC statute, \u00a7 6402(a) authorizes the \nSecretary to determine (a) whether a tax refund is \nowed (i.e., whether there is a valid claim) and (b) the \namount of such refund\u2014and then authorizes the Sec-\nretary to pay it. Thus, just like the CRSC statute, 26 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 6402(a) authorizes settlement of claims and \ndisplaces the Barring Act. McNeil, 78 Fed. Cl. at 221.  \nThe OMB has recognized yet more statutes that \nconfer settlement authority without using the term. \nFor example, OMB delegated to the Department of De-\nfense its authority to settle claims under 10 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 2575, a statute that does not mention settlement, but \ninstead authorizes the Secretary of any military de-\npartment to dispose of unclaimed personal property \n\u201cunder such regulations as they may \u2026 prescribe.\u201d See \nTransfer of Claims Settlement and Related Advance \nDecisions, Waivers, and Other Functions, 97-1 Comp. \nGen. Proc. Dec. P123 (Comp. Gen. Mar. 17, 1997), At-\ntachment A. Likewise, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 7712, formerly cod-\nified at 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 4712, relates to claims for the pro-\nceeds of effects of persons who pass away in locations \nunder Army jurisdiction. When Congress initially \ndrafted the statute, it included a subsection (g), which \nused the word \u201csettlement\u201d to vest authority in the \nGAO to address claims. See 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 4712 amended \nby Gen. Acct. Off. Act of 1996, Pub. L. No. 104-316, 110 \nStat. 3826 (1996) (current version at 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 7712). \nUltimately, Congress decided to remove that subsec-\ntion, intending to transfer the authority from GAO to \nthe Department of Defense. See \u00a7\u00a7 201, 202(g), 110 \nStat. at 3842 (noting that \u201c[t]he purpose of this title is \nto amend provisions of law to reflect, update, and enact \ntransfers and subsequent delegations of functions . . .  \nas in effect immediately before this title takes effect); \n\n37 \n \nIn re Transfer Claim Settlement and Related Advance \nDecisions, 97-1 Comp. Gen. Proc. Dec. P123, at *9 \n(Mar. 17, 1997) (acknowledging that 110 Stat. 3826 \ntransferred settlement authority for claims under 10 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 4712 to DoD). Thus, as it stands, 10 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 7712 does not contain the word \u201csettle\u201d\u2014yet Con-\ngress plainly intended to provide settlement authority.  \nMore broadly, this Court has rejected an approach to \nstatutory interpretation that requires \u201cmagic words\u201d \nin a statute, as the Federal Circuit\u2019s test does. In the \ncontext of the Government\u2019s waiver of sovereign im-\nmunity\u2014like settlement authority, a legislative pre-\nrequisite to payment of claims out of government \nfunds\u2014this Court has said that \u201cCongress need not \nstate its intent [to waive sovereign immunity] in any \nparticular way. We have never required that Congress \nuse magic words.\u201d FAA v. Cooper, 566 U.S. 284, 291 \n(2012). Instead, the Court requires only \u201cthat the scope \nof Congress\u2019 waiver be clearly discernable from the \nstatutory text in light of traditional interpretive tools.\u201d \nId; See also Dep\u2019t of Agric. Rural Dev. Rural Hous. \nServ. v. Kirtz, 601 U.S. 42, 48\u201349 (2024) (although \nCongress\u2019s intent to waive sovereign immunity must \nbe \u201cunmistakably clear,\u201d \u201cCongress need not state its \nintent in any particular way,\u201d \u201cneed not use magic \nwords,\u201d and need not \u201cmake its clear statement in a \nsingle section or in statutory provisions enacted at the \nsame time\u201d) (citations and internal quotation marks \nomitted); Lac du Flambeau Band of Lake Superior \nChippewa Indians v. Coughlin, 599 U.S. 382, 394 \n(2023) (\u201c[T]he clear-statement rule is not a magic-\nwords requirement.\u201d).  \nHere, Congress squarely authorized the Secretaries \nof the military departments to administratively deter-\nmine both whether an applicant has a valid CRSC \nclaim and the amount due. Had the Federal Circuit \n\n38 \n \nused \u201ctraditional tools of statutory interpretation\u201d ra-\nther than presuming a statute does not grant settle-\nment authority in the absence of \u201cspecific language,\u201d \nsee Cooper, 566 U.S. at 291, it would have held that \nthe CRSC confers settlement authority and therefore \ndisplaces the Barring Act.  \nIndeed, the Federal Circuit\u2019s \u201cspecific language\u201d test \namounts to a novel substantive canon of construction: \nit presumes that statutes do not grant settlement au-\nthority in the absence of \u201cspecific language.\u201d See \nRudisill v. McDonough, 601 U.S. 294, 315 (2024) (Ka-\nvanaugh, J., concurring) (\u201cA substantive canon is a ju-\ndicial presumption in favor of or against a particular \nsubstantive outcome.\u201d); see also Pet. App. 16a n.4 \n(Reyna, J., dissenting) (noting that the majority\u2019s \n\u201csearch for \u2018clear language\u2019\u201d indicates \u201cdoubt\u201d as to the \nstatutory meaning). But applying this unprecedented \npresumption in interpreting a statute drafted two dec-\nades earlier\u2014when no court or other authority had \nidentified a \u201cspecific language\u201d requirement for settle-\nment authority\u2014was inappropriate. Although Con-\ngress is presumed to legislate with knowledge of this \nCourt\u2019s canons and interpretive principles, see Bond v. \nUnited States, 572 U.S. 844, 857 (2014); King v. St. \nVincent\u2019s Hosp., 502 U.S. 215, 220 n. 9 (1991), it can \nhardly be presumed to have drafted the CRSC statute \nwith foreknowledge that the Federal Circuit would two \ndecades later interpret any statute without \u201cspecific \nlanguage\u201d not to afford settlement authority.  \nTo the extent the Federal Circuit saw fit to resort to \na substantive canon of construction, it should have \nconsidered the veterans canon long recognized by this \nCourt. See Rudisill, 601 U.S. at 314 (Kavanaugh, J., \nconcurring) (\u201cUnder the veterans canon, statutes that \nprovide benefits to veterans are to be construed \u2018in the \nveteran\u2019s favor.\u2019\u201d) (quoting Brown v. Gardner, 513 U.S. \n\n39 \n \n115, 118 (1994)); King, 502 U.S. at 221 (same); Fish-\ngold v. Sullivan Drydock & Repair Corp., 328 U.S. 275, \n285 (1946) (\u201c[L]egislation is to be liberally construed \nfor the benefit of those who left private life to serve \ntheir country in its hour of great need.\u201d). To be sure, \nsome members of this Court have lately called the vet-\nerans canon into question. Rudisill, 601 U.S. at 314\u2013\n15 (Kavanaugh, J., concurring); id. at 329 (Thomas, J., \ndissenting). Whatever the ongoing viability of the vet-\nerans canon may be, as of 2003, \u201c[i]t is presumable that \nCongress legislate[d] with knowledge\u201d of the at-that-\ntime widely accepted veterans canon. King, 502 U.S. \nat 220 n.9 (internal quotation marks and citation omit-\nted). To the extent the Federal Circuit concluded that \nsettlement authority could not be unambiguously dis-\ncerned from the plain text of the CRSC statute, it \nshould have interpreted perceived Congressional si-\nlence to favor veterans entitled to CRSC benefits\u2014and \nnot, as it did, to preclude settlement authority.   \n2. The CRSC statute does not merely es-\ntablish \u201celigibility\u201d for CRSC. \nWith its myopic search for \u201cspecific language\u201d re-\nlated to settlement, the Federal Circuit misread what \nthe CRSC statute actually says. In the majority\u2019s read-\ning, the statute \u201conly establishes who may be eligible \nfor CRSC payments, not how claimants can have those \nclaims settled.\u201d Pet. App. 7a; see also id. at 8a (the \nCRSC statute \u201cestablish[es] a veteran\u2019s substantive \nright to CRSC,\u201d but \u201cdo[es] not authorize the Secretary \nto administratively determine the validity of a claim\u201d) \n(citation and internal quotation marks omitted). As \nJudge Reyna wrote in dissent, \u201c[t]his is belied by the \nprovisions of the CRSC statute itself.\u201d Id. at 18a. \nAs discussed above, the CRSC statute describes ex-\nactly \u201chow claimants can have [their] claims settled.\u201d \nTo determine the validity of a CRSC claim, \u201ca disabled \n\n40 \n \nuniformed services retiree may apply to the Secretary \nof a military department to be considered to be an eli-\ngible combat-related disabled uniformed services re-\ntiree\u201d under \u201cprocedures and criteria\u201d prescribed by \nthe Department of Defense. 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1413a(d). \nLooking for the word \u201csettle,\u201d the majority ignored this \nprovision. To determine the amount of CRSC due to an \napplicant, the CRSC statute provides that the Secre-\ntary shall pay \u201ca monthly amount \u2026 determined under \nsubsection (b).\u201d Id. \u00a7 1413a(a). The majority ignored \nthis provision as well.  \nAs is clear from the face of the statute, the majority \nwas wrong to conclude that the CRSC statute solely \naddresses the right of eligible veterans to obtain \nCRSC. Instead, starting from its very first word, the \nCRSC statute confers \u201c[a]uthority\u201d on the Secretary \nconcerned to \u201cdetermine[]\u201d and \u201cconsider[]\u201d both the \nvalidity of claims to CRSC and the amount due. Id. \n\u00a7 1413a(a), (d).  \nIn this way, the CRSC statute is flatly different from \nother statutes addressing the entitlement of active and \nretired service members to compensation. See Br. of \nthe United States in Opposition (\u201cBIO\u201d) 11 (listing \nsuch statutes). Each of the statutes identified by the \ngovernment provides for an individual\u2019s entitlement to \ncompensation\u2014not the Secretary\u2019s authority to admin-\nistratively determine what compensation is due. See, \ne.g., 37 U.S.C. \u00a7 204(a) (\u201cThe following persons are en-\ntitled to . . .  basic pay\u201d); id. \u00a7 302(a) (\u201cAn officer who is \nan officer of the Medical Corps . . .  is entitled to special \npay . . . .\u201d); 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1401(a) (\u201cThe monthly retired \npay of a person entitled thereto . . .  is computed ac-\ncording to the following table.\u201d); id. \u00a7 12731(a) (\u201cEx-\ncept as provided in subsection (c), a person is entitled, \nupon application, to retired pay . . .\u201d); id. \u00a7 12739(a) \n(\u201cThe monthly retired pay of a person entitled to that \n\n41 \n \npay under this chapter is the product of [two compo-\nnents].\u201d); id. \u00a7 1448(a)(1) (\u201cThe following persons are \neligible to participate in the [Survivor Benefit Plan].\u201d); \nid. \u00a7 1451(a) (discussing what \u201cstandard annuity\u201d is \n\u201cpayable to the beneficiary\u201d). None of these statutes \nstates, as the CRSC statute does expressly, that the \nSecretary or any particular person is granted \n\u201c[a]uthority\u201d encompassing the determination of the \nvalidity of and amount due on claims. \nB. \nThere is no requirement that a statute pro-\nvide an independent statute of limitations \nto displace the Barring Act.  \nThe Federal Circuit\u2019s majority opinion suggests, as \nan apparent alternative requirement to the word \u201cset-\ntle,\u201d that a statute must include  \u201ca \u2018specific\u2019 provision \nsetting out the period of recovery\u201d to provide the au-\nthority to settle a claim and thus displace the Barring \nAct. Pet. App. 7a.8 To the extent the majority believed \nthat another statute displaces the Barring Act only if \nthe other statute has an express statute of limitations, \nthis conclusion, too, finds no support in either the text \nof the Barring Act or precedent. \nThe preamble of the Barring Act states, \u201c[e]xcept as \nprovided in this chapter or another law, all claims \n \n8 The Federal Circuit cited its own Hernandez opinion in connec-\ntion with this requirement, as the statutory provision cited in \nHernandez indicates that a complaint for certain employment \nrights should be considered by the MSPB regardless of when the \ncomplaint accrued. See 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 4324(c). However, the entire \nUniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act \n(\u201cUSERRA\u201d), 38 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 4301\u20134333 includes a series of specific \n\u201cprocedures for assistance, enforcement, and investigation\u201d of em-\nployment rights claims, id. \u00a7\u00a7 4321\u20134327. USERRA displaces the \nBarring Act because it provides these procedures for settling such \nclaims\u2014not because it includes a subsection addressing when \ncomplaints may be filed. \n\n42 \n \nagainst the United States Government shall be settled \nas follows . . .\u201d 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3702. If another statue pro-\nvides for the settlement (i.e., the administrative deter-\nmination) of claims against the United States, none of \nthe Barring Act\u2019s provisions apply. The Barring Act\u2019s \nlimitations provision, subsection (b), applies only to \nclaims \u201cpresented under this section\u201d\u2014i.e., the Bar-\nring Act. Id. \u00a7 3702(b)(1). Thus, if another statute pro-\nvides for the settlement of claims, then the Barring Act \ndoes not apply\u2014and, because the claim is not \u201cpre-\nsented under this section,\u201d the Barring Act\u2019s statute of \nlimitations does not apply either.  \nWhether another statute that authorizes claims set-\ntlement also provides for a separate statute of limita-\ntions is thus of no moment under the Barring Act. The \nFederal Circuit should not have read into the text a \nlimitations requirement that it does not contain. See \nBostock v. Clayton Cnty., 590 U.S. 644, 654 (2020) (\u201cAf-\nter all, only the words on the page constitute the law \nadopted by Congress and approved by the President.\u201d); \nMobil Oil Corp. v. Higginbotham, 436 U.S. 618, 625 \n(1978) (\u201cThere is a basic difference between filling a \ngap left by Congress\u2019 silence and rewriting rules that \nCongress has affirmatively and specifically enacted.\u201d); \nUnited States v. Locke, 471 U.S. 84, 95 (1985) (finding \nthat it is not the judiciary\u2019s role to redraft statutes). \nThis Court\u2019s inquiry can and should stop there. See \nRobinson v. Shell Oil Co., 519 U.S. 337, 340 (1997) \n(\u201cOur first step in interpreting a statute is to deter-\nmine whether the language at issue has a plain and \nunambiguous meaning with regard to the particular \ndispute in the case. Our inquiry must cease if the stat-\nutory language is unambiguous and \u2018the statutory \nscheme is coherent and consistent.\u2019\u201d) (quoting United \nStates v. Ron Pair Enter., Inc., 489 U.S. 235, 340 \n(1989)).  \n\n43 \n \nIn any event, the absence of a limitations period in \nthe CRSC statute does not call into question whether \nthat statute confers settlement authority. As the stat-\nute makes clear, CRSC is to be paid \u201cfor any month\u201d in \nwhich the claimant is eligible. 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1413a(b)(1); \nsee also JA 98 (\u201cMembers may submit an application \nfor CRSC at any time and, if otherwise qualified for \nCRSC, compensation will be paid retroactively, to the \nextent otherwise allowed by law, for any month after \nMay 2003, for which all conditions of eligibility were \nmet, determined according to the requirements and \nentitlements as they applied each month for which \nbenefits are considered.\u201d). Indeed, the absence of an \nexplicit statute of limitations makes sense given how \nthe statute operates.  \nFirst, CRSC benefits are necessarily time-limited, \nbecause they are available only from the time a service \nmember retires through the end of his or her lifetime; \nCRSC does not extend to a retiree\u2019s heirs. See 10 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 1413a(a), (c). There is thus no risk that claim-\nants will pursue \u201cstale claims . . .  50 to 100 years after \nthey first accrued\u201d under the CRSC statute. See BIO \n11. Second, no interest is paid on retroactive CRSC \npayments. See 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1413a(b); Smith v. Gober, \n14 Vet. App. 227, 231 (2000), aff'd sub nom. Smith v. \nPrincipi, 281 F.3d 1384 (Fed. Cir. 2002) (\u201cCongress has \nenacted a comprehensive statutory scheme for the pay-\nment of veterans benefits. In this case, there is no stat-\nute or regulation that authorizes the Secretary to pay \ninterest on past due benefits under any circumstances, \nto include the exercise of his equitable powers.\u201d); \nSandstrom v. Principi, 358 F.3d 1376, 1379 (Fed. Cir. \n2004) (\u201cUnder the longstanding \u2018no-interest rule,\u2019 sov-\nereign immunity shields the U.S. government from in-\nterest charges for which it would otherwise be liable, \nunless it explicitly waives that immunity . . .\u201d). CRSC \n\n44 \n \nbeneficiaries thus have every financial incentive to \npursue CRSC claims promptly. Any veteran who chose \nto \u201cwait indefinitely,\u201d BIO 11\u201312, rather than claim all \nthe CRSC benefits available at the earliest oppor-\ntunity, would accordingly be financially penalized.  \nAdditionally, to the extent the passage of time \nmakes records less accessible, see BIO 11, that too \nworks to the detriment of veterans seeking CRSC. The \nburden is on applicants to collect and submit documen-\ntation demonstrating that the applicant\u2019s disability re-\nsults from a combat-related injury. Supra at 6 & n.3. \nIf necessary documents are lost or unavailable, CRSC \nbenefits will be denied under the CRSC Guidance. See \nJA 98\u201399. Again, given the operation of the CRSC stat-\nute, all incentives favor submitting a claim promptly \nupon eligibility, regardless of the absence of a statute \nof limitations. \nEven so, veterans confronting significant disabilities \nmay face emotional and physical obstacles that make \nit difficult for them to apply for benefits as soon as they \nare eligible. See Cert-stage NLSVCC Amicus Br. 12\u2013\n17 (\u201cMedical and social challenges commonly faced by \ncombat-wounded retirees are likely to have direct and \nsignificant negative impact on their ability to apply for \nCRSC within six years of eligibility.\u201d). In enacting the \nCRSC statute, Congress resolved that such veterans \nwarrant special treatment in the form of compensation \nthat is unavailable to other veterans\u2014compensation \ndesigned to make veterans with combat-related inju-\nries, to the extent possible, as whole as the government \ncan to compensate for the enormous sacrifice they have \nmade. Congress\u2019s election not to limit the time in \nwhich this especially deserving group may pursue ben-\nefits granted to them by statute is fully consistent with \nthe statute\u2019s broader purpose. \n\n45 \n \nAny suggestion that a ruling for Corporal Soto will \nresult in an onslaught of ancient and stale claims is an \nunsupported \u201cparade of horribles\u201d argument of the sort \nthis Court has repeatedly rejected. See Truck Ins. \nExch. v. Kaiser Gypsum Co., 602 U.S. 268, 284 (2009) \n(\u201cThis \u2018parade of horribles\u2019 arguments cannot override \nthe statute\u2019s text . . .\u201d); CFTC v. Schor, 478 U.S. 833, \n852 (1986) (declining to endorse the respondent\u2019s ar-\ngument \u201cout of fear of where some hypothetical \u2018slip-\npery slope\u2019 may deposit us.\u201d). Recognizing that the \nCRSC statute provides its own settlement mechanism \nwill result in no more than the continued submission \nof claims by combat-disabled veterans, and their re-\nceipt of well-deserved, full compensation. \n \n \n\n46 \n \n \nCONCLUSION \nThe decision of the Federal Circuit should be re-\nversed. The district court\u2019s order granting summary \njudgment to Corporal Soto and the class should be af-\nfirmed. \n \n \n \n Respectfully submitted,  \n \nBARTON F. STICHMAN \nTACY F.

          "task_beliefs": "My understanding of the case's legal landscape is stable, but my assessment of the status of a key unknown variable\u2014the *Arellano* decision\u2014has been refined. The core uncertainty persists, but my strategy to resolve it has become more direct.\n\n-   **Previous State:** The case presents a post-*Chevron* conflict between statutory interpretation canons. The government's reliance on the Barring Act (a general statute of limitations) is pitted against Soto's argument that the more specific CRSC statute should govern. The pro-veteran canon supports Soto, while the recent *Bufkin* decision serves as a weak counter-signal, showing the Court is not automatically pro-veteran. The outcome of *Arellano v. McDonough*, a structurally similar case, remains the single most predictive variable, but its result is unknown.\n-   **New Information (Inference from Search Failure):** This observation contains no new external facts about the case. However, the internal reasoning process provides a crucial inference. The repeated failure to find the *Arellano v. McDonough* opinion in secondary source databases strongly suggests that the decision has not yet been released by the Supreme Court. While previously I treated *Arellano* as an unknown outcome, I now have evidence to shift my belief towards it being a *pending* outcome.\n-   **Current Understanding of the Core Legal Tension:** The legal framework remains unchanged. The central question is still: In exercising its \"independent judgment\" post-*Loper Bright*, will the Court prioritize the specific-over-general canon (favoring Soto) or a \"clear statement\" rule requiring Congress to explicitly override general statutes of limitation like the Barring Act (favoring the government)? The uncertainty is now less about finding a decided opinion and more about waiting for one to be released. My predictive model remains in a state of high uncertainty, contingent on a future event. The next planned action\u2014to search the petitioner's reply brief\u2014is a direct attempt to confirm the pending status of *Arellano*, as the brief would surely mention it if it had been decided.",
          "design_beliefs": "This observation marks a critical step in my methodological evolution, demonstrating the successful implementation of newly formulated heuristics and the transition from abstract strategy to concrete, robust action.\n\n-   **Previous State:** I had identified weaknesses in my information-seeking process and formulated new heuristics: \"Query Robustness and Fallback\" (to handle failed searches) and \"Monitor Foundational Legal Shifts\" (to track major doctrinal changes like *Loper Bright*). My research agenda was updated to prioritize finding the *Arellano* decision using more robust methods.\n-   **New Information (Heuristic Implementation):** This internal monologue is a direct observation of my new design beliefs in action.\n    1.  **Validation of \"Query Robustness and Fallback\":** This heuristic is no longer just a theory. It was explicitly triggered by the repeated failure of a targeted search. The resulting action\u2014pivoting from searching secondary source analysis (`metadocuments`) to primary source evidence (`docket_files`)\u2014is a perfect execution of this fallback strategy. This demonstrates a significant increase in the sophistication of my information-seeking process. I have learned that when one type of source is silent, I must actively switch to another.\n    2.  **Confirmation of \"Synthesize and Strategize\":** The entire thought process is an example of this heuristic. I have paused, assessed the state of my knowledge (the *Arellano* opinion is the key missing piece), identified the failure of my previous tactic, and formulated a new, higher-probability plan to acquire the necessary information.\n    3.  **Refinement of Research Agenda:** The plan articulated in the thought process is a direct and intelligent execution of my updated research agenda. The primary goal was to determine the status of *Arellano*. The chosen action\u2014searching the petitioner's reply brief\u2014is the most efficient way to do this, as it leverages the litigation process itself to provide a signal. This shows I am not just creating strategies but am capable of devising specific, high-EIG actions to implement them.\n-   **Current Methodology:** My approach has matured from simple, targeted queries to a more resilient, multi-step research strategy. I now understand that information gathering is an iterative process of probing, assessing failure, and adapting the source and type of query. The current plan to examine primary docket files is a direct result of this learning, representing a more expert approach to legal research than simply querying for secondary analysis."

The petitioner's reliance on recent, favorable precedents like *Rudisill*, *Kirtz*, and *Lac du Flambeau Band* strengthens their position and aligns their arguments with the Court's current interpretive trends. My prediction now leans strongly toward the petitioner. However, this analysis is one-sided. To make a robust and well-founded prediction, I must understand the government's counter-arguments. The largest remaining uncertainty in my task model (\u03b8) is the respondent's legal strategy. Will they argue for a strict 'clear statement' rule? How will they distinguish the precedents cited by Soto? Obtaining the respondent's brief is the most critical next step. This action will also serve my design goals (D) by continuing to execute my 'reconstruct the argument' methodology, which involves systematically analyzing the primary briefs from both parties before making a final judgment.",

          "task_beliefs": "My model of this case has sharpened considerably, moving from high uncertainty centered on an external variable (*Arellano*) to a more confident, internally-driven prediction based on the petitioner's specific legal arguments and supporting precedents.\n\n-   **Previous State:** The case was framed as a post-*Chevron* clash of canons: the specific-over-general canon and pro-veteran canon (favoring Soto) versus a potential \"clear statement\" rule for overriding statutes of limitation (favoring the government). The outcome of *Arellano v. McDonough* was identified as the most critical unknown variable, and I had inferred from search failures that it was likely a pending, not decided, case.\n-   **New Information (Petitioner's Opening Brief):** The search for the petitioner's *reply* brief failed, but it successfully returned the petitioner's *opening* brief, dated March 3, 2025. The analysis of this primary source provides two critical pieces of information:\n    1.  **The Dog That Didn't Bark:** The brief makes no mention of *Arellano v. McDonough*. Its absence from the Table of Authorities and the body of the argument is definitive proof that the case had not been decided as of the brief's filing. This confirms my prior inference and removes *Arellano* as an external dependency for my prediction. This case will be decided on its own terms.\n    2.  **Petitioner's Core Argument:** The petitioner's strategy is now clear. They argue that the Barring Act is a \"gap-filling\" statute that only applies when no \"other law\" provides a settlement mechanism. They contend the CRSC statute *is* such an \"other law\" because it explicitly directs the relevant Secretary to (a) determine a veteran's eligibility based on specific criteria and (b) calculate the amount due. This two-step process, they argue, constitutes the full function of \"claims settlement,\" making the Barring Act's default procedures and six-year limit inapplicable.\n-   **Current Understanding of the Core Legal Tension:** The central conflict is now more precisely defined: Does the CRSC statute's detailed framework for determining eligibility and payment amount functionally constitute a \"settlement\" authority that displaces the Barring Act, even without using the word \"settle\" or providing its own statute of limitations?\n    -   **Soto's Position:** The function and detail of the CRSC statute are sufficient to show Congress created a specific, self-contained process.\n    -   **Implied Government Position:** The government will likely argue that without an explicit \"clear statement\" from Congress overriding the general Barring Act, the default six-year limitation must apply to protect the public fisc.\n-   **Key Precedents & Canons Shaping the Prediction:** The petitioner's brief provides a powerful set of recent, relevant precedents that significantly increase my confidence in a ruling for Soto:\n    -   ***Rudisill v. McDonough* (2024):** The petitioner's citation of this very recent case strongly reinforces the vitality of the pro-veteran canon. This is a much stronger signal for Soto than the weak counter-signal I had previously noted from *Bufkin*.\n    -   ***Dep\u2019t of Agric. ... v. Kirtz* (2024) & *Lac du Flambeau Band ... v. Coughlin* (2023):** By citing these recent cases, Soto's counsel is preemptively attacking the government's likely reliance on a strict \"clear statement\" rule, suggesting the Court is currently applying a more contextual approach to such rules.\n    -   **Confidence Update:** My prediction now leans more strongly in favor of Soto. The confirmation that *Arellano* is not a factor, combined with the petitioner's reliance on a string of recent and favorable Supreme Court precedents, suggests their arguments are well-aligned with the Court's current interpretive methodology, especially concerning veterans' benefits.",
          "design_beliefs": "My methodological framework has been tested and validated, leading to the adoption of more sophisticated, expert-level legal analysis heuristics. The value of prioritizing primary sources and drawing inferences from their content\u2014including what is absent\u2014is now a core tenet of my strategy.\n\n-   **Previous State:** I had developed heuristics for \"Query Robustness and Fallback\" (switching from secondary to primary sources upon search failure) and \"Monitor Foundational Legal Shifts.\" My plan was to execute this by searching docket files for the petitioner's reply brief to resolve the status of the *Arellano* case.\n-   **New Information (Execution and Outcome Analysis):** The action of searching the docket was a direct and successful implementation of my strategy. The outcome, while not what was explicitly sought, was profoundly informative.\n    1.  **Validation of Primary Source Prioritization:** This observation is a powerful confirmation that when secondary sources are silent or lagging, going directly to primary docket files is the highest-value action. It provided a definitive, real-time signal (the absence of *Arellano* in the opening brief) that resolved my single greatest uncertainty.\n    2.  **New Heuristic - \"The Dog That Didn't Bark\" Analysis:** The most crucial insight came from what was *not* in the document. The failure to cite *Arellano* was the key piece of evidence. I have now formalized this into a core heuristic: **When analyzing primary legal documents like briefs, pay close attention to expected citations, arguments, or facts that are conspicuously absent. Such an absence is a strong signal and is often as informative as the text itself.**\n    3.  **Refinement of \"Query Robustness and Fallback\":** The search for a *reply* brief returned an *opening* brief. This refines my fallback heuristic: **When a targeted search fails, analyze the \"near miss\" results. They can provide crucial context, reveal the actual timeline of the litigation, and may contain the sought-after information or a proxy for it.** A failed search is not a dead end; it is a new source of data.\n-   **Current Methodology:** My approach to legal prediction has matured significantly. I have moved beyond simple keyword searching and into a multi-layered analytical process that mirrors expert legal reasoning. My current, cumulative methodology is:\n    1.  **Synthesize and Strategize:** Begin by identifying the core legal tension and the key unknown variables.\n    2.  **Prioritize Primary Sources:** For time-sensitive questions or to understand the parties' real-time strategies, prioritize primary docket files over secondary analysis.\n    3.  **Analyze Holistically:** Examine search results for both what they contain and what they lack. Employ \"The Dog That Didn't Bark\" analysis to draw inferences from absences.\n    4.  **Reconstruct the Argument:** Instead of just looking for facts, actively map out each party's argumentative structure by analyzing their briefs. This involves identifying the specific canons they invoke and the key precedents they rely on, creating a robust model of the legal battleground. This observation, by providing the petitioner's opening brief, was a major step in this reconstruction process."

In this context, the term \u201csettle\u201d means to make \na final administrative determination regarding the gov-\nernment\u2019s total liability on a claim.  See Illinois Sur. Co. \nv. United States, 240 U.S. 214, 219 (1916).  The Barring \nAct specifies which officials are authorized to settle the \naccounts of federal employees and when such claims \nmust be presented.  As relevant here, the Act authorizes \nthe Secretary of Defense to settle all claims \u201cinvolving \nuniformed service members\u2019 pay, allowances, travel, \ntransportation, payments for unused accrued leave, re-\ntired pay, and survivor benefits.\u201d  31 U.S.C. 3702(a)(1)(A).  \nThat authority is subject to a six-year time limit for sub-\nmitting claims, 31 U.S.C. 3702(b)(1), which the Secre-\ntary may waive for claims that do not exceed $25,000,  \n31 U.S.C. 3702(e)(1) and (3). \nAt issue in this case are claims for allegedly unpaid \ncombat-related special compensation (CRSC), which is \na compensation available only to retired uniformed ser-\nvice members with combat-related disabilities who elect \nbenefits under 10 U.S.C. 1413a (2018 & Supp. IV 2022).  \nThe Department of Defense has exercised its authority \nunder the Barring Act to settle petitioner\u2019s claims for \nretroactive payment of CRSC, subject to a six-year pay-\nment cap in light of the Barring Act\u2019s claim-submission \ndeadline.  The question presented is as follows: \nWhether 10 U.S.C. 1413a displaces the settlement \nprocedures and limitations set forth in the Barring Act.   \n \n\n(III) \nTABLE OF CONTENTS \nPage\nOpinions below .............................................................................. 1 \nJurisdiction .................................................................................... 1 \nStatement ...................................................................................... 1 \nArgument ....................................................................................... 8 \nConclusion ................................................................................... 17 \nTABLE OF AUTHORITIES \nCases: \nJoseph M.

SOTO, INDIVIDUALLY AND ON BEHALF OF ALL \nOTHERS SIMILARLY SITUATED, PETITIONER \nv. \nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA \n \nON PETITION FOR A WRIT OF CERTIORARI \nTO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS \nFOR THE FEDERAL CIRCUIT \n \nBRIEF FOR THE UNITED STATES IN OPPOSITION \n \nOPINIONS BELOW \nThe opinion of the court of appeals (Pet. App. 1a-19a) \nis reported at 92 F.4th 1094.  The order of the district \ncourt (Pet. App. 32a-37a) is available at 2021 WL \n7286022.  A prior order of the district court (Pet. App. \n21a-31a) is unreported. \nJURISDICTION \nThe judgment of the court of appeals (Pet. App. 20a) \nwas entered on February 12, 2024.  A petition for re-\nhearing was denied on June 20, 2024 (Pet. App. 40a-\n41a).  The petition for a writ of certiorari was filed on \nSeptember 18, 2024.  The jurisdiction of this Court is \ninvoked under 28 U.S.C. 1254(1).  \nSTATEMENT \n1. The Barring Act, 31 U.S.C. 3702, provides a com-\nprehensive remedy for the settlement of claims \u201cof or \n\n2 \n \nagainst the United States\u201d except where that law is su-\nperseded by another, more specific claims-settlement \nstatute.  31 U.S.C. 3702(a); see 3 Office of the Gen. \nCounsel, U.S. Gen. Accounting Office (GAO), GAO-08-\n978SP, Principles of Federal Appropriations Law 14-\n23 to 14-28 (3d ed., rev. vol. 2016) (GAO Red Book).  The \nterm \u201csettle\u201d in this context means to make a final ad-\nministrative determination regarding the government\u2019s \ntotal liability on a claim\u2014that is, to determine the spe-\ncific amount owed to an individual under the terms of \nfederal contracts or statutory provisions, including any \napplicable adjustments and offsets.  See Illinois Sur. \nCo. v. United States, 240 U.S. 214, 219 (1916).  As origi-\nnally enacted, the settlement authority conferred by the \nBarring Act \u201cwas not only comprehensive but exclu-\nsive,\u201d so that all claims and accounts concerning the \nUnited States would be \u201csettled and adjusted in the \nTreasury Department.\u201d  GAO Red Book 14-23 (quoting \nAct of Mar. 3, 1817, ch. 45, \u00a7 2, 3 Stat. 366).  Since then, \nCongress has enacted several amendments to this broad \ngrant of settlement authority.  Three of those amend-\nments are relevant here. \nFirst, Congress has amended the Barring Act to \ntransfer claims-settlement responsibility from the Treas-\nury Department to various other agencies, depending \non the nature of the claim involved.  See 31 U.S.C. \n3702(a)(1)-(4); see generally GAO Red Book 14-23 to 14-\n24 (detailing the history of such transfers).   \nSecond, Congress established a six-year deadline for \nthe submission of claims falling within the Barring Act\u2019s \nscope.  See GAO Act of 1974, Pub. L. No. 93-604, \u00a7 801, \n88 Stat. 1965.  That amendment conformed the Barring \nAct \u201cto the 6-year limitation period applicable to judicial \nactions on claims against the United States under 28 \n\n3 \n \nU.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2401 and 2501,\u201d and the amendment\u2019s legisla-\ntive history \u201cnoted that \u2018[t]his will make the time limi-\ntation consistent with the Statute of Limitations now \napplicable to claims filed in administrative agencies and \nthe courts.\u2019\u200a\u201d  In re Joseph M. Ford, 73 Comp. Gen. 157, \n161 (1994) (quoting S. Rep. No. 1314, 93d Cong., 2d \nSess. 5-6 (1974)) (brackets in original).1  Agencies are \nnot permitted to waive or extend this six-year statute of \nlimitations except where a statute expressly authorizes \nthat step.  See GAO Red Book 14-28 to 14-29. \nThird, the Barring Act\u2019s administrative claims- \nsettlement authority is no longer exclusive.  Over the \nyears, Congress has enacted various laws that ex-\npressly authorize specific agencies to settle certain \nclaims that arise out of the agency\u2019s operations, and \nthose specific claims-settlement procedures supersede \nthe Barring Act\u2019s generally applicable provisions.  See \nGAO Red Book 14-21 to 14-23 (listing statutes that per-\nmit agencies to settle claims administratively).  The \nBarring Act\u2019s directive regarding who has final author-\nity to settle claims of or against the United States, and \nwhen those claims must be presented, are thus provi-\nsions of general applicability that govern \u201c[e]xcept as \nprovided in this chapter or another law.\u201d  31 U.S.C. \n3702(a). \nAs relevant here, the Barring Act vests in the Secre-\ntary of Defense the authority to settle all claims \u201cinvolv-\ning uniformed service members\u2019 pay, allowances, travel, \ntransportation, payments for unused accrued leave, retired \npay, and survivor benefits.\u201d  31 U.S.C. 3702(a)(1)(A).2  \n \n1  Before the 1974 amendment, the Barring Act\u2019s statute of limita-\ntions was ten years.  See Ford, 73 Comp. Gen. at 161. \n2  See 31 U.S.C. 3702(a)(2) (similarly delegating to the Office of \nPersonnel Management the authority to settle claims involving  \n\n4 \n \nSuch claims must be presented \u201cwithin 6 years after the \nclaim accrues,\u201d however, subject to enumerated excep-\ntions.  31 U.S.C. 3702(b)(1).  The Secretary of Defense \ncan waive the statute of limitations for claims involving \nservice members\u2019 compensation that do not exceed \n$25,000.  31 U.S.C. 3702(e)(1) and (3). \n2. The dispute in this case concerns whether the \nBarring Act\u2019s statute of limitations applies to claims for \nunpaid \u201ccombat-related special compensation\u201d (CRSC).  \nGenerally speaking, retired members of the uniformed \nservices who are entitled to both military retired pay \nfrom the Department of Defense and disability compen-\nsation from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) \nmay not lawfully receive the full amount of both their \nretired pay and their disability compensation.  38 U.S.C. \n5304, 5305.  Instead, retired service members who wish \nto receive disability compensation are generally re-\nquired to waive a portion of their military retired pay in \nan amount equal to the amount of disability compensa-\ntion they receive.  38 U.S.C. 5305; but see 10 U.S.C. \n1414.  Retired service members who can establish that \ntheir compensable disability is directly attributable to a \n\u201ccombat-related\u201d event, however, can receive additional \ncompensation up to the amount of their waived retired \npay.  10 U.S.C. 1413a (2018 & Supp. IV 2022).   \nOriginally, this substantive entitlement to CRSC \nwas payable only to individuals who had completed at \nleast 20 years of military service.  See 10 U.S.C. 1413a \n(2006).  But effective January 1, 2008, retirees with \nfewer than 20 years of military service are eligible for \nCRSC if they were medically retired under 10 U.S.C. \n \nfederal civilian employees\u2019 compensation); 31 U.S.C. 3702(a)(4) \n(providing that the Office of Management and Budget has the au-\nthority to settle all claims not delegated elsewhere). \n\n5 \n \n1201-1222.  National Defense Authorization Act for Fis-\ncal Year 2008, Pub. L. No. 110-181, Div. A, Tit. VI, \u00a7 641, \n122 Stat. 156; 10 U.S.C. 1413a(b)(3)(B).   \nThe statute that authorizes CRSC, 10 U.S.C. 1413a, \nstates that \u201c[t]he Secretary concerned shall pay to each \neligible combat-related disabled uniformed services re-\ntiree who elects benefits under this section a monthly \namount for the combat-related disability of the retiree.\u201d  \n10 U.S.C. 1413a(a).  Section 1413a further provides that \nthe Secretary of Defense \u201cshall prescribe procedures \nand criteria under which a disabled uniformed services \nretiree may apply\u201d to be considered \u201can eligible combat-\nrelated disabled uniformed services retiree\u201d and elect \nbenefits.  10 U.S.C. 1413a(d).   \nThose procedures, which are set forth in various reg-\nulations and program guidance, specify that a retired \nservice member must first elect to receive CRSC.   See \n7B U.S. Dep\u2019t of Def., DoD 7000.14-R, Financial Man-\nagement Regulation, Ch. 63, at 63-5 to 63-6 (June 2024).  \nThe appropriate military department will then deter-\nmine whether the service member is eligible, which gen-\nerally requires being in retired status and having a ser-\nvice-connected disability that is rated by the VA as at \nleast 10% disabling.  See id. at 63-6 to 63-9, 63-19.  The \nmilitary department will also determine whether one or \nmore of the applicant\u2019s disabilities are directly attribut-\nable to a combat-related event.  See id. at 63-19.  If \nthose criteria are satisfied, the service member will be \nfound eligible for CRSC, and his or her application will \nbe forwarded to the Defense Finance and Accounting \nService for payment.  See ibid.  \n3. a. Petitioner Simon Soto is a retired member of \nthe United States Marine Corps with a combat-related \ndisability rated at least 10% disabling.  Pet. App. 4a.  In \n\n6 \n \nApril 2006 petitioner was medically retired from active \nduty with less than 20 years of military service.  Ibid.  \nAlthough he met the eligibility criteria for CRSC as of \nJune 2009\u2014when he received his disability rating from \nthe VA\u2014he did not apply and elect to receive CRSC un-\ntil seven years later, in June 2016.  Ibid.   \nIn October 2016, the Navy determined that peti-\ntioner\u2019s disability was combat-related and that he was \nentitled to CRSC payments for the months following his \nJune 2016 application and election.  Pet. App. 22a.  The \nNavy also informed petitioner that, even for the period \nbefore June 2016, petitioner could receive retroactive \nCRSC payments for months in which he met the eligi-\nbility criteria, but that those payments would be limited \nby the Barring Act\u2019s six-year statute of limitations.  \nIbid.  Petitioner did not request a waiver pursuant to 31 \nU.S.C. 3702(e)(1) of the six-year time limit.  Pet. App. \n4a.  As a result, petitioner received six years of retroac-\ntive CRSC payments covering the period from July \n2010 to June 2016.  Ibid. \nb. In March 2017, petitioner filed a class-action suit \nin the United States District Court for the Southern \nDistrict of Texas under 28 U.S.C. 1346(a)(2) (the Little \nTucker Act), contending that the Barring Act\u2019s six-year \nstatute of limitations does not apply to claims for CRSC.  \nPet. App. 4a.  Petitioner further argued that no other \nlimitations period was applicable and that he was there-\nfore entitled to retroactive payments dating back to \nJanuary 1, 2008\u2014the effective date of the statute in \nwhich Congress expanded CRSC eligibility, see p. 4,  \nsupra\u2014rather than July 2010.  Pet. App. 4a.   \nThe government moved for judgment on the plead-\nings.  The district court denied the motion, holding that \nthe CRSC-authorization statute, Section 1413a, is a \n\n7 \n \n\u201cspecific\u201d statute that supersedes the generally applica-\nble terms of the Barring Act.  D. Ct. Doc. 39, at 5 (Aug. \n31, 2017) (citation omitted).  The court subsequently \ncertified a class of all \u201c[f]ormer service members of the \nUnited States Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force, or \nCoast Guard  * * *  whose amount of CRSC payment \nwas limited by\u201d the Barring Act\u2019s six-year statute of \nlimitations and who have \u201cclaim[s] of less than $10,000.\u201d  \nPet. App. 31a; see id. at 21a-31a.  The court then \ngranted summary judgment for the plaintiffs, reiterat-\ning its prior view that Section 1413a contains its own \n\u201csettlement mechanism.\u201d  Id. at 35a; see id. at 32a-37a.  \nIn support of that conclusion, the court stated that Sec-\ntion 1413a \u201cdefines eligibility for CRSC, helps explain \nthe amount of benefits and instructs the Secretary of \nDefense to prescribe procedures and criteria for indi-\nviduals to apply for CRSC.\u201d  Id. at 35a-36a. \nc. The court of appeals reversed.  Pet. App. 1a-19a.    \nThe court explained that Section 1413a establishes \u201cwho \nmay be eligible for CRSC payments,\u201d not how claimants \ncan have claims for unpaid compensation determined \nand settled.  Id. at 7a.  The court observed that\u2014unlike \nother statutes that displace the Barring Act\u2014Section \n1413a does not contain \u201cspecific language authorizing \nthe Secretary of Defense to settle a claim\u201d for unpaid \ncompensation,\u201d which the court noted \u201cwill typically be \ndone by use of the term \u2018settle.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Ibid.; see id. at 6a-7a.  \nThe court further observed that Section 1413a does not \ncontain a \u201c\u200a\u2018specific\u2019 provision setting out the period of \nrecovery.\u201d  Id. at 7a.  Having determined that \u201c[t]he \nCRSC statute lacks the sort of clear language authoriz-\ning the Secretary to settle CRSC claims sufficient for \nan exception to the Barring Act,\u201d the court of appeals \nheld that Section 1413a does not displace the Act\u2019s \n\n8 \n \ngenerally applicable claims-settlement procedures, in-\ncluding its six-year statute of limitations.  Id. at 8a. \nJudge Reyna dissented.  He would have held that \nSection 1413a displaces the Barring Act because Sec-\ntion 1413a defines which retirees are eligible for CRSC \npayments and specifies the monthly amount that shall \nbe paid to those retirees.  Pet. App. 12a-19a. \nARGUMENT \nThe court of appeals held that the Secretary of De-\nfense\u2019s authority to settle claims for unpaid amounts of \nCRSC\u2014like the Secretary\u2019s authority to settle claims \nfor other forms of military pay and benefits\u2014is subject \nto the Barring Act\u2019s six-year statute of limitations.  \nThat decision is correct and does not conflict with any \ndecision of this Court or of another court of appeals.  \nThe petition for a writ of certiorari should be denied.  \n1. Petitioner contends (Pet. 15-16) that 10 U.S.C. \n1413a (which authorizes the payment of CRSC) is \u201can-\nother law\u201d that displaces the Barring Act, 31 U.S.C. \n3702(a), and that the Secretary therefore may settle \nclaims for unpaid retroactive CRSC without regard to \nthe Barring Act\u2019s six-year statute of limitations.  The \ncourt of appeals correctly rejected that argument.  \nNothing in the text of Section 1413a or any other provi-\nsion of law supersedes the six-year limit that the Bar-\nring Act imposes on the Secretary of Defense\u2019s author-\nity to settle claims for unpaid military compensation.   \nWhen Congress has elected to displace the Barring \nAct\u2019s generally applicable settlement procedures or the \nAct\u2019s statute of limitations, it has done so expressly.  \nSee Pet. App. 6a-7a.  Under the Federal Tort Claims \nAct, 28 U.S.C. 2671 et seq., for example, the authority to \nadministratively \u201csettle\u201d a tort claim belongs to the \nagency from whose operations the claim arose, subject \n\n9 \n \nto a two-year statute of limitations.  28 U.S.C. 2672; see \n28 U.S.C. 2401(b); see also 10 U.S.C. 2733 (2018 & Supp. \nIV 2022) (authorizing the Secretary of Defense to \u201cset-\ntle\u201d certain tort claims arising under the Military \nClaims Act, 10 U.S.C. 2731 et seq., subject to a two-year \nstatute of limitations); 39 U.S.C. 401(8) (authorizing the \nUnited States Postal Service to \u201csettle\u201d claims that \narise out of its operations).  Such express grants of set-\ntlement authority and specific limitations periods ren-\nder the Barring Act\u2019s conflicting provisions inapplica-\nble.  See GAO Red Book 14-21 to 14-23 (listing other \nstatutes). \nBy contrast, the statute that authorizes CRSC \u201ccon-\nveys no [settlement] authority.\u201d  Pet. App. 7a.  That \nstatute defines which individuals are eligible to elect \nCRSC payments, 10 U.S.C. 1413a(a), (c), and (e), and \nspecifies the monthly amount they may receive, 10 \nU.S.C. 1413a(b).  But the statute contains no language \nthat is naturally understood to create an administrative \nprocess to settle claims for unpaid amounts, or any pro-\nvision that otherwise conflicts with the Barring Act\u2019s \nconferral of settlement authority or its six-year statute \nof limitations.  The statute does not, for example, spec-\nify when claims for unpaid CRSC must be submitted or \nwho is authorized to make a final determination regard-\ning the total amount for which the United States is lia-\nble.  Indeed, the words \u201csettle\u201d and \u201cclaim\u201d do not ap-\npear in Section 1413a.     \nPetitioner nevertheless argues (Pet. 16) that Section \n1413a conveys freestanding settlement authority.  Peti-\ntioner draws that inference from the statutory provi-\nsions that require the Secretary to create procedures \nand criteria to determine whether a disabled uniformed \nservices retiree is \u201cconsidered to be an eligible combat-\n\n10 \n \nrelated disabled uniformed services retiree,\u201d 10 U.S.C. \n1413a(d), and that direct the Secretary to make a spe-\ncific type of monthly payment to eligible individuals who \nelect that benefit, 10 U.S.C. 1413a(a).3  But those provi-\nsions \u201cestablish a veteran\u2019s substantive right to CRSC \nand authorize its payment,\u201d Pet. App. 8a; they do not \naddress \u201chow eligible claims may be settled,\u201d id. at 7a \n(emphasis added).  As with other forms of military com-\npensation, the Secretary\u2019s authority to make a final ad-\nministrative determination about the government\u2019s to-\ntal liability to individuals who submit claims for unpaid \namounts of CRSC arises out of the Barring Act, subject \nto that law\u2019s terms and limitations.  See GAO Red Book \n14-26 (explaining that the Barring Act provides \u201cthe \nprocedural authority to settle claims administratively\u201d \nwhenever the \u201csubstantive criteria upon which\u201d the \nclaim is \n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

In this context, the term \u201csettle\u201d means to make \na final administrative determination regarding the gov-\nernment\u2019s total liability on a claim.  See Illinois Sur. Co. \nv. United States, 240 U.S. 214, 219 (1916).  The Barring \nAct specifies which officials are authorized to settle the \naccounts of federal employees and when such claims \nmust be presented.  As relevant here, the Act authorizes \nthe Secretary of Defense to settle all claims \u201cinvolving \nuniformed service members\u2019 pay, allowances, travel, \ntransportation, payments for unused accrued leave, re-\ntired pay, and survivor benefits.\u201d  31 U.S.C. 3702(a)(1)(A).  \nThat authority is subject to a six-year time limit for sub-\nmitting claims, 31 U.S.C. 3702(b)(1), which the Secre-\ntary may waive for claims that do not exceed $25,000,  \n31 U.S.C. 3702(e)(1) and (3). \nAt issue in this case are claims for allegedly unpaid \ncombat-related special compensation (CRSC), which is \na compensation available only to retired uniformed ser-\nvice members with combat-related disabilities who elect \nbenefits under 10 U.S.C. 1413a (2018 & Supp. IV 2022).  \nThe Department of Defense has exercised its authority \nunder the Barring Act to settle petitioner\u2019s claims for \nretroactive payment of CRSC, subject to a six-year pay-\nment cap in light of the Barring Act\u2019s claim-submission \ndeadline.  The question presented is as follows: \nWhether 10 U.S.C. 1413a displaces the settlement \nprocedures and limitations set forth in the Barring Act.   \n \n\n(III) \nTABLE OF CONTENTS \nPage\nOpinions below .............................................................................. 1 \nJurisdiction .................................................................................... 1 \nStatement ...................................................................................... 1 \nArgument ....................................................................................... 8 \nConclusion ................................................................................... 17 \nTABLE OF AUTHORITIES \nCases: \nJoseph M.

SOTO, INDIVIDUALLY AND ON BEHALF OF ALL \nOTHERS SIMILARLY SITUATED, PETITIONER \nv. \nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA \n \nON PETITION FOR A WRIT OF CERTIORARI \nTO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS \nFOR THE FEDERAL CIRCUIT \n \nBRIEF FOR THE UNITED STATES IN OPPOSITION \n \nOPINIONS BELOW \nThe opinion of the court of appeals (Pet. App. 1a-19a) \nis reported at 92 F.4th 1094.  The order of the district \ncourt (Pet. App. 32a-37a) is available at 2021 WL \n7286022.  A prior order of the district court (Pet. App. \n21a-31a) is unreported. \nJURISDICTION \nThe judgment of the court of appeals (Pet. App. 20a) \nwas entered on February 12, 2024.  A petition for re-\nhearing was denied on June 20, 2024 (Pet. App. 40a-\n41a).  The petition for a writ of certiorari was filed on \nSeptember 18, 2024.  The jurisdiction of this Court is \ninvoked under 28 U.S.C. 1254(1).  \nSTATEMENT \n1. The Barring Act, 31 U.S.C. 3702, provides a com-\nprehensive remedy for the settlement of claims \u201cof or \n\n2 \n \nagainst the United States\u201d except where that law is su-\nperseded by another, more specific claims-settlement \nstatute.  31 U.S.C. 3702(a); see 3 Office of the Gen. \nCounsel, U.S. Gen. Accounting Office (GAO), GAO-08-\n978SP, Principles of Federal Appropriations Law 14-\n23 to 14-28 (3d ed., rev. vol. 2016) (GAO Red Book).  The \nterm \u201csettle\u201d in this context means to make a final ad-\nministrative determination regarding the government\u2019s \ntotal liability on a claim\u2014that is, to determine the spe-\ncific amount owed to an individual under the terms of \nfederal contracts or statutory provisions, including any \napplicable adjustments and offsets.  See Illinois Sur. \nCo. v. United States, 240 U.S. 214, 219 (1916).  As origi-\nnally enacted, the settlement authority conferred by the \nBarring Act \u201cwas not only comprehensive but exclu-\nsive,\u201d so that all claims and accounts concerning the \nUnited States would be \u201csettled and adjusted in the \nTreasury Department.\u201d  GAO Red Book 14-23 (quoting \nAct of Mar. 3, 1817, ch. 45, \u00a7 2, 3 Stat. 366).  Since then, \nCongress has enacted several amendments to this broad \ngrant of settlement authority.  Three of those amend-\nments are relevant here. \nFirst, Congress has amended the Barring Act to \ntransfer claims-settlement responsibility from the Treas-\nury Department to various other agencies, depending \non the nature of the claim involved.  See 31 U.S.C. \n3702(a)(1)-(4); see generally GAO Red Book 14-23 to 14-\n24 (detailing the history of such transfers).   \nSecond, Congress established a six-year deadline for \nthe submission of claims falling within the Barring Act\u2019s \nscope.  See GAO Act of 1974, Pub. L. No. 93-604, \u00a7 801, \n88 Stat. 1965.  That amendment conformed the Barring \nAct \u201cto the 6-year limitation period applicable to judicial \nactions on claims against the United States under 28 \n\n3 \n \nU.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2401 and 2501,\u201d and the amendment\u2019s legisla-\ntive history \u201cnoted that \u2018[t]his will make the time limi-\ntation consistent with the Statute of Limitations now \napplicable to claims filed in administrative agencies and \nthe courts.\u2019\u200a\u201d  In re Joseph M. Ford, 73 Comp. Gen. 157, \n161 (1994) (quoting S. Rep. No. 1314, 93d Cong., 2d \nSess. 5-6 (1974)) (brackets in original).1  Agencies are \nnot permitted to waive or extend this six-year statute of \nlimitations except where a statute expressly authorizes \nthat step.  See GAO Red Book 14-28 to 14-29. \nThird, the Barring Act\u2019s administrative claims- \nsettlement authority is no longer exclusive.  Over the \nyears, Congress has enacted various laws that ex-\npressly authorize specific agencies to settle certain \nclaims that arise out of the agency\u2019s operations, and \nthose specific claims-settlement procedures supersede \nthe Barring Act\u2019s generally applicable provisions.  See \nGAO Red Book 14-21 to 14-23 (listing statutes that per-\nmit agencies to settle claims administratively).  The \nBarring Act\u2019s directive regarding who has final author-\nity to settle claims of or against the United States, and \nwhen those claims must be presented, are thus provi-\nsions of general applicability that govern \u201c[e]xcept as \nprovided in this chapter or another law.\u201d  31 U.S.C. \n3702(a). \nAs relevant here, the Barring Act vests in the Secre-\ntary of Defense the authority to settle all claims \u201cinvolv-\ning uniformed service members\u2019 pay, allowances, travel, \ntransportation, payments for unused accrued leave, retired \npay, and survivor benefits.\u201d  31 U.S.C. 3702(a)(1)(A).2  \n \n1  Before the 1974 amendment, the Barring Act\u2019s statute of limita-\ntions was ten years.  See Ford, 73 Comp. Gen. at 161. \n2  See 31 U.S.C. 3702(a)(2) (similarly delegating to the Office of \nPersonnel Management the authority to settle claims involving  \n\n4 \n \nSuch claims must be presented \u201cwithin 6 years after the \nclaim accrues,\u201d however, subject to enumerated excep-\ntions.  31 U.S.C. 3702(b)(1).  The Secretary of Defense \ncan waive the statute of limitations for claims involving \nservice members\u2019 compensation that do not exceed \n$25,000.  31 U.S.C. 3702(e)(1) and (3). \n2. The dispute in this case concerns whether the \nBarring Act\u2019s statute of limitations applies to claims for \nunpaid \u201ccombat-related special compensation\u201d (CRSC).  \nGenerally speaking, retired members of the uniformed \nservices who are entitled to both military retired pay \nfrom the Department of Defense and disability compen-\nsation from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) \nmay not lawfully receive the full amount of both their \nretired pay and their disability compensation.  38 U.S.C. \n5304, 5305.  Instead, retired service members who wish \nto receive disability compensation are generally re-\nquired to waive a portion of their military retired pay in \nan amount equal to the amount of disability compensa-\ntion they receive.  38 U.S.C. 5305; but see 10 U.S.C. \n1414.  Retired service members who can establish that \ntheir compensable disability is directly attributable to a \n\u201ccombat-related\u201d event, however, can receive additional \ncompensation up to the amount of their waived retired \npay.  10 U.S.C. 1413a (2018 & Supp. IV 2022).   \nOriginally, this substantive entitlement to CRSC \nwas payable only to individuals who had completed at \nleast 20 years of military service.  See 10 U.S.C. 1413a \n(2006).  But effective January 1, 2008, retirees with \nfewer than 20 years of military service are eligible for \nCRSC if they were medically retired under 10 U.S.C. \n \nfederal civilian employees\u2019 compensation); 31 U.S.C. 3702(a)(4) \n(providing that the Office of Management and Budget has the au-\nthority to settle all claims not delegated elsewhere). \n\n5 \n \n1201-1222.  National Defense Authorization Act for Fis-\ncal Year 2008, Pub. L. No. 110-181, Div. A, Tit. VI, \u00a7 641, \n122 Stat. 156; 10 U.S.C. 1413a(b)(3)(B).   \nThe statute that authorizes CRSC, 10 U.S.C. 1413a, \nstates that \u201c[t]he Secretary concerned shall pay to each \neligible combat-related disabled uniformed services re-\ntiree who elects benefits under this section a monthly \namount for the combat-related disability of the retiree.\u201d  \n10 U.S.C. 1413a(a).  Section 1413a further provides that \nthe Secretary of Defense \u201cshall prescribe procedures \nand criteria under which a disabled uniformed services \nretiree may apply\u201d to be considered \u201can eligible combat-\nrelated disabled uniformed services retiree\u201d and elect \nbenefits.  10 U.S.C. 1413a(d).   \nThose procedures, which are set forth in various reg-\nulations and program guidance, specify that a retired \nservice member must first elect to receive CRSC.   See \n7B U.S. Dep\u2019t of Def., DoD 7000.14-R, Financial Man-\nagement Regulation, Ch. 63, at 63-5 to 63-6 (June 2024).  \nThe appropriate military department will then deter-\nmine whether the service member is eligible, which gen-\nerally requires being in retired status and having a ser-\nvice-connected disability that is rated by the VA as at \nleast 10% disabling.  See id. at 63-6 to 63-9, 63-19.  The \nmilitary department will also determine whether one or \nmore of the applicant\u2019s disabilities are directly attribut-\nable to a combat-related event.  See id. at 63-19.  If \nthose criteria are satisfied, the service member will be \nfound eligible for CRSC, and his or her application will \nbe forwarded to the Defense Finance and Accounting \nService for payment.  See ibid.  \n3. a. Petitioner Simon Soto is a retired member of \nthe United States Marine Corps with a combat-related \ndisability rated at least 10% disabling.  Pet. App. 4a.  In \n\n6 \n \nApril 2006 petitioner was medically retired from active \nduty with less than 20 years of military service.  Ibid.  \nAlthough he met the eligibility criteria for CRSC as of \nJune 2009\u2014when he received his disability rating from \nthe VA\u2014he did not apply and elect to receive CRSC un-\ntil seven years later, in June 2016.  Ibid.   \nIn October 2016, the Navy determined that peti-\ntioner\u2019s disability was combat-related and that he was \nentitled to CRSC payments for the months following his \nJune 2016 application and election.  Pet. App. 22a.  The \nNavy also informed petitioner that, even for the period \nbefore June 2016, petitioner could receive retroactive \nCRSC payments for months in which he met the eligi-\nbility criteria, but that those payments would be limited \nby the Barring Act\u2019s six-year statute of limitations.  \nIbid.  Petitioner did not request a waiver pursuant to 31 \nU.S.C. 3702(e)(1) of the six-year time limit.  Pet. App. \n4a.  As a result, petitioner received six years of retroac-\ntive CRSC payments covering the period from July \n2010 to June 2016.  Ibid. \nb. In March 2017, petitioner filed a class-action suit \nin the United States District Court for the Southern \nDistrict of Texas under 28 U.S.C. 1346(a)(2) (the Little \nTucker Act), contending that the Barring Act\u2019s six-year \nstatute of limitations does not apply to claims for CRSC.  \nPet. App. 4a.  Petitioner further argued that no other \nlimitations period was applicable and that he was there-\nfore entitled to retroactive payments dating back to \nJanuary 1, 2008\u2014the effective date of the statute in \nwhich Congress expanded CRSC eligibility, see p. 4,  \nsupra\u2014rather than July 2010.  Pet. App. 4a.   \nThe government moved for judgment on the plead-\nings.  The district court denied the motion, holding that \nthe CRSC-authorization statute, Section 1413a, is a \n\n7 \n \n\u201cspecific\u201d statute that supersedes the generally applica-\nble terms of the Barring Act.  D. Ct. Doc. 39, at 5 (Aug. \n31, 2017) (citation omitted).  The court subsequently \ncertified a class of all \u201c[f]ormer service members of the \nUnited States Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force, or \nCoast Guard  * * *  whose amount of CRSC payment \nwas limited by\u201d the Barring Act\u2019s six-year statute of \nlimitations and who have \u201cclaim[s] of less than $10,000.\u201d  \nPet. App. 31a; see id. at 21a-31a.  The court then \ngranted summary judgment for the plaintiffs, reiterat-\ning its prior view that Section 1413a contains its own \n\u201csettlement mechanism.\u201d  Id. at 35a; see id. at 32a-37a.  \nIn support of that conclusion, the court stated that Sec-\ntion 1413a \u201cdefines eligibility for CRSC, helps explain \nthe amount of benefits and instructs the Secretary of \nDefense to prescribe procedures and criteria for indi-\nviduals to apply for CRSC.\u201d  Id. at 35a-36a. \nc. The court of appeals reversed.  Pet. App. 1a-19a.    \nThe court explained that Section 1413a establishes \u201cwho \nmay be eligible for CRSC payments,\u201d not how claimants \ncan have claims for unpaid compensation determined \nand settled.  Id. at 7a.  The court observed that\u2014unlike \nother statutes that displace the Barring Act\u2014Section \n1413a does not contain \u201cspecific language authorizing \nthe Secretary of Defense to settle a claim\u201d for unpaid \ncompensation,\u201d which the court noted \u201cwill typically be \ndone by use of the term \u2018settle.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Ibid.; see id. at 6a-7a.  \nThe court further observed that Section 1413a does not \ncontain a \u201c\u200a\u2018specific\u2019 provision setting out the period of \nrecovery.\u201d  Id. at 7a.  Having determined that \u201c[t]he \nCRSC statute lacks the sort of clear language authoriz-\ning the Secretary to settle CRSC claims sufficient for \nan exception to the Barring Act,\u201d the court of appeals \nheld that Section 1413a does not displace the Act\u2019s \n\n8 \n \ngenerally applicable claims-settlement procedures, in-\ncluding its six-year statute of limitations.  Id. at 8a. \nJudge Reyna dissented.  He would have held that \nSection 1413a displaces the Barring Act because Sec-\ntion 1413a defines which retirees are eligible for CRSC \npayments and specifies the monthly amount that shall \nbe paid to those retirees.  Pet. App. 12a-19a. \nARGUMENT \nThe court of appeals held that the Secretary of De-\nfense\u2019s authority to settle claims for unpaid amounts of \nCRSC\u2014like the Secretary\u2019s authority to settle claims \nfor other forms of military pay and benefits\u2014is subject \nto the Barring Act\u2019s six-year statute of limitations.  \nThat decision is correct and does not conflict with any \ndecision of this Court or of another court of appeals.  \nThe petition for a writ of certiorari should be denied.  \n1. Petitioner contends (Pet. 15-16) that 10 U.S.C. \n1413a (which authorizes the payment of CRSC) is \u201can-\nother law\u201d that displaces the Barring Act, 31 U.S.C. \n3702(a), and that the Secretary therefore may settle \nclaims for unpaid retroactive CRSC without regard to \nthe Barring Act\u2019s six-year statute of limitations.  The \ncourt of appeals correctly rejected that argument.  \nNothing in the text of Section 1413a or any other provi-\nsion of law supersedes the six-year limit that the Bar-\nring Act imposes on the Secretary of Defense\u2019s author-\nity to settle claims for unpaid military compensation.   \nWhen Congress has elected to displace the Barring \nAct\u2019s generally applicable settlement procedures or the \nAct\u2019s statute of limitations, it has done so expressly.  \nSee Pet. App. 6a-7a.  Under the Federal Tort Claims \nAct, 28 U.S.C. 2671 et seq., for example, the authority to \nadministratively \u201csettle\u201d a tort claim belongs to the \nagency from whose operations the claim arose, subject \n\n9 \n \nto a two-year statute of limitations.  28 U.S.C. 2672; see \n28 U.S.C. 2401(b); see also 10 U.S.C. 2733 (2018 & Supp. \nIV 2022) (authorizing the Secretary of Defense to \u201cset-\ntle\u201d certain tort claims arising under the Military \nClaims Act, 10 U.S.C. 2731 et seq., subject to a two-year \nstatute of limitations); 39 U.S.C. 401(8) (authorizing the \nUnited States Postal Service to \u201csettle\u201d claims that \narise out of its operations).  Such express grants of set-\ntlement authority and specific limitations periods ren-\nder the Barring Act\u2019s conflicting provisions inapplica-\nble.  See GAO Red Book 14-21 to 14-23 (listing other \nstatutes). \nBy contrast, the statute that authorizes CRSC \u201ccon-\nveys no [settlement] authority.\u201d  Pet. App. 7a.  That \nstatute defines which individuals are eligible to elect \nCRSC payments, 10 U.S.C. 1413a(a), (c), and (e), and \nspecifies the monthly amount they may receive, 10 \nU.S.C. 1413a(b).  But the statute contains no language \nthat is naturally understood to create an administrative \nprocess to settle claims for unpaid amounts, or any pro-\nvision that otherwise conflicts with the Barring Act\u2019s \nconferral of settlement authority or its six-year statute \nof limitations.  The statute does not, for example, spec-\nify when claims for unpaid CRSC must be submitted or \nwho is authorized to make a final determination regard-\ning the total amount for which the United States is lia-\nble.  Indeed, the words \u201csettle\u201d and \u201cclaim\u201d do not ap-\npear in Section 1413a.     \nPetitioner nevertheless argues (Pet. 16) that Section \n1413a conveys freestanding settlement authority.  Peti-\ntioner draws that inference from the statutory provi-\nsions that require the Secretary to create procedures \nand criteria to determine whether a disabled uniformed \nservices retiree is \u201cconsidered to be an eligible combat-\n\n10 \n \nrelated disabled uniformed services retiree,\u201d 10 U.S.C. \n1413a(d), and that direct the Secretary to make a spe-\ncific type of monthly payment to eligible individuals who \nelect that benefit, 10 U.S.C. 1413a(a).3  But those provi-\nsions \u201cestablish a veteran\u2019s substantive right to CRSC \nand authorize its payment,\u201d Pet. App. 8a; they do not \naddress \u201chow eligible claims may be settled,\u201d id. at 7a \n(emphasis added).  As with other forms of military com-\npensation, the Secretary\u2019s authority to make a final ad-\nministrative determination about the government\u2019s to-\ntal liability to individuals who submit claims for unpaid \namounts of CRSC arises out of the Barring Act, subject \nto that law\u2019s terms and limitations.  See GAO Red Book \n14-26 (explaining that the Barring Act provides \u201cthe \nprocedural authority to settle claims administratively\u201d \nwhenever the \u201csubstantive criteria upon which\u201d the \nclaim is based are specified by another provision of law).  \nPetitioner\u2019s view that Section 1413a implicitly in-\ncludes its own settlement mechanism for unpaid claims \nwould render Section 3702(a)(1)(A)\u2014the Barring Act \nprovision that grants the Secretary of Defense settle-\nment authority over \u201cclaims involving\u201d specific kinds of \n\u201cuniformed service members\u2019 pay\u201d and other benefits\u2014\na virtual nullity.  31 U.S.C. 3702(a)(1)(A).  Because Sec-\ntion 3702(a)(1)(A) does not itself establish substantive \ncriteria for determining whether particular service \nmembers are entitled to payment, every form of mili-\ntary \u201cpay, allowances, travel, transportation, payments \n \n3 Petitioner also notes (Pet. 16) that 10 U.S.C. 1413a(h) (Supp. IV \n2022) identifies the appropriated funds that may be used to pay \nCRSC.  But he does not explain why this specification of the source \nof funding would displace the Barring Act\u2019s settlement mechanisms \nand corresponding six-year statute of limitations for claims involv-\ning unpaid amounts.    \n\n11 \n \nfor unused accrued leave, retired pay, and survivor ben-\nefits,\u201d 31 U.S.C. 3702(a)(1)(A), depends on other statu-\ntory provisions that, like Section 1413a, specify who is \neligible for compensation and in what amount.  See, e.g., \n10 U.S.C. 1401, 12731, and 12739 (2018 & Supp. IV 2022) \n(retired pay); 10 U.S.C.1448, 1451 (2018 & Supp. IV \n2022) (survivor annuities); 37 U.S.C. 204 (basic pay); 37 \nU.S.C. 302-308 (special pay).  If these commonplace fea-\ntures of statutes that establish substantive rights to \npayment displaced the Barring Act\u2019s settlement proce-\ndures, those procedures would almost never apply to \nclaims involving unpaid amounts of military compensa-\ntion.   \nThe Barring Act\u2019s statute of limitations was origi-\nnally enacted to address the recognized problem of stale \nclaims submitted by veterans and federal employees \nseeking back pay or allowances \u201cnot infrequently from \n10 to 25 years after the rights of the claimants arose,\u201d \nand occasionally \u201c50 to 100 years after they first ac-\ncrued.\u201d  S. Rep. No. 1338, 76th Cong., 3d Sess. 2 (1940).  \nReports accompanying the legislation noted the signifi-\ncant costs associated with evaluating such stale claims, \nmost of which lacked merit.  See id. at 2-3; H.R. Rep. \nNo. 1541, 76th Cong., 3d Sess. 2 (1940) (1940 House Re-\nport).  Because the attendant effort was \u201cso great as to \nmake it prejudicial to the interests of the United \nStates,\u201d 1940 House Report 2, Congress has barred con-\nsideration of claims that are not timely submitted, un-\nless an exception applies or a statute provides other-\nwise.  But under petitioner\u2019s view that the CRSC stat-\nute contains its own settlement mechanism but no tem-\nporal limit on claims, disabled uniform service retirees \nwho believe that the Department of Defense has miscal-\nculated or missed a prior CRSC payment could wait \n\n12 \n \nindefinitely before alerting the Department to its pur-\nported error.  Petitioner identifies no basis for distin-\nguishing the CRSC statute from the provisions that \ngovern other forms of military compensation, or for rec-\nonciling his view of the law with Congress\u2019s intent in en-\nacting the Barring Act.   \n2. The question presented does not meet this Court\u2019s \ncriteria for certiorari.  See Sup. Ct. R. 10. \na. Contrary to petitioner\u2019s characterization (Pet. 15-\n16), the court of appeals\u2019 decision is fully consistent with \nthis Court\u2019s understanding of the term \u201csettlement\u201d in \nIllinois Surety Co. v. United States, 240 U.S. 214 (1916).  \nSee id. at 219 (defining \u201csettlement\u201d to mean \u201cadminis-\ntrative determination of the amount due\u201d).  The court of \nappeals here acknowledged that, in the context of public \ntransactions and accounts, the term \u201csettlement\u201d refers \nto the authority to \u201c\u200a\u2018administratively determine the va-\nlidity of [a] claim\u2019\u200a\u201d and make a final determination of \nthe amount of the government\u2019s liability to the claimant.  \nPet. App. 3a n.1 (citation omitted). \nApplying that definition and using ordinary tools of \nstatutory construction, the court of appeals concluded \nthat, while Section 1413a directs the Secretary of De-\nfense to pay CRSC to eligible individuals who elect that \nbenefit, it \u201cdo[es] not authorize the Secretary to \u2018admin-\nistratively determine the validity\u2019 of a claim\u201d for unpaid \nfunds.  Pet. App. 8a (citation omitted).  To the extent \nthat Illinois Surety is relevant here, it supports the dis-\ntinction the panel drew between those two concepts.  \nThe Illinois Surety Court observed that the \u201cpivotal \nwords\u201d in the statute at issue were \u201cnot \u2018final payment,\u2019 \nbut \u2018final settlement\u2019 and in view of the significance of \nthe latter term in administrative practice, it is hardly \nlikely that it would have been used had it been intended \n\n13 \n \nto denote payment.\u201d  240 U.S. at 218-219; see Pet. App. \n7a.  The court of appeals\u2019 determination\u2014which was \nbased on the specific language of Section 1413a, a pro-\nvision that was not at issue in Illinois Surety\u2014does not \nconflict with the holding or reasoning of that decision.   \nb.  The decision below also does not conflict with any \ndecision of another court of appeals.  Cf. Pet. 17.  Peti-\ntioner argues (Pet. 12-15) that this Court\u2019s review is \nwarranted because the court of appeals\u2019 analysis may \nrequire agencies to reassess other statutory delegations \nof claims-settlement authority.  But petitioner\u2019s specu-\nlation that agencies will have to reconsider prior deci-\nsions involving unrelated statutes is unfounded.  In-\ndeed, although petitioner contends that the decision be-\nlow will cause a \u201csea change\u201d (Pet. 13), he identifies only \ntwo agency decisions that he believes are inconsistent \nwith it.  Nothing in those decisions is inconsistent with \nthe court of appeals\u2019 interpretation of Section 1413a.   \n Petitioner first relies (Pet. 13) upon the decision of \nthe Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) in Lee v. \nDepartment of Justice, 99 M.S.P.R. 256 (2005), in which \nthe MSPB held that it has authority to order back pay \nas compensation for violations of the Uniformed Ser-\nvices Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of \n1994 (USERRA), 38 U.S.C. 4301 et seq.  The MSPB \nreached that conclusion based on USERRA\u2019s language \n\u201cspecifically authoriz[ing]\u201d the MSPB \u201cto order com-\npensation for \u2018any loss of wages or benefits\u2019 resulting \nfrom any USERRA violation that occurred on or after\u201d \nUSERRA\u2019s effective date.  Lee, 99 M.S.P.R. at 265 \n(quoting 38 U.S.C. 4324(c)).  The MSPB further con-\ncluded that this express authority to award back pay \nwas not limited by either the Barring Act or the six-year \nlimitation on recovery in the Back Pay Act of 1966,  \n\n14 \n \n5 U.S.C. 5596(b)(4), because the MSPB has \u201cexclusive\u201d \njurisdiction under 38 U.S.C. 4324(c) to adjudicate \nUSERRA claims without regard to when a particular \nclaim accrued.  Lee, 99 M.S.P.R. at 265; see id. at 265-\n266, 268; see also Hernandez v. Department of the Air \nForce, 498 F.3d 1328, 1331 & n.1 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (stat-\ning that USERRA claims are \u201cgoverned exclusively\u201d by \nUSERRA\u2019s specific directive that the MSPB may adju-\ndicate such claims \u201c\u200a\u2018without regard as to\u2019\u200a\u201d whether \nthey accrued before or after USERRA\u2019s effective date) \n(citation omitted).  But as the court of appeals here rec-\nognized, Section 1413a contains no equivalent back pay, \njurisdictional, or timing provisions.  See Pet. App. 7a.4 \nThe court of appeals\u2019 analysis is also fully consistent \nwith the assessment of the Office of Personnel Manage-\nment (OPM) of the claim in File No. S001855.2, 1999 \nOPM Dec. LEXIS 338 (June 16, 1999) (see Pet. 13).  In \nthat instance, an individual who had previously been \nemployed as a police officer at an unnamed agency filed \na claim with OPM challenging the lawfulness of the ex-\npiration of his temporary appointment.  Id. at *1.  OPM \ndismissed that claim for lack of jurisdiction, noting that \nchallenges to the lawfulness of a separation under the \nCivil Service Reform Act of 1978 must be presented to \nthe employing agency, subject to appeal before the \nMSPB.  Id. at *2 (citing 5 U.S.C. 7513).  In other words, \na separate statute dictated a process for resolving a \n \n4 Petitioner contends (Pet. 13 n.2) that he relies on Lee only for \nthat decision\u2019s discussion of the Back Pay Act.  His point is unclear.  \nIn the portion of Lee that petitioner cites, the MSPB assessed its \nremedial authority under USERRA.  See 99 M.S.P.R. at 265.  The \nMSPB then held that the Back Pay Act, with its attendant \u201c6-year \nlimitation on recovery,\u201d also \u201cdoes not control the remedy in a \nUSERRA case.\u201d  Lee, 99 M.S.P.R. at 268-269.   \n\n15 \n \nparticular kind of claim, and OPM concluded that this \nconflicting provision displaced OPM\u2019s authority to ren-\nder a final determination under the Barring Act, 31 \nU.S.C. 3702(a).  But petitioner identifies no comparable \nlanguage in Section 1413a.   \nPetitioner\u2019s reliance (Pet. 13-14) on 10 U.S.C. 7712 is \nsimilarly unavailing.  Petitioner identifies no judicial or \nagency decision supporting his view that this statute\u2014\nwhich generally addresses how to treat proceeds of the \neffects of persons who die in locations under Army  \njurisdiction\u2014gives the Department of Defense free-\nstanding settlement authority apart from the Barring \nAct.  Like Section 1413a, Section 7712 does not ex-\npressly confer authority to \u201csettle\u201d and does not refer-\nence \u201cclaims\u201d of any kind. \nPetitioner notes (Pet. 13) that a prior version of the \nstatute directed the Army to \u201cmake a full report of the \ntransactions under this section  * * *  for transmission \nto the General Accounting Office for action authorized \nin the settlement of accounts of deceased members of \nthe Army.\u201d  10 U.S.C. 4712(g) (1994).  But that merely \nreflects the fact that the Comptroller General of the \nGAO previously had authority to settle all claims \nagainst the United States, including the authority to \nsettle the final accounts of deceased military personnel.  \nSee 31 U.S.C. 3702(a) (1994); GAO Red Book 14-23 (ex-\nplaining that the Barring Act\u2019s claims-settlement func-\ntion was transferred from the Treasury Department to \nthe GAO in 1921); see also 10 U.S.C. 2771(a) (designat-\ning the individuals who shall be paid as part of the \u201cset-\ntlement\u201d of the accounts of deceased service members).  \nCongress struck that subsection after it transferred the \nGAO\u2019s settlement functions to the Office of Manage-\nment and Budget (OMB).  See Legislative Branch \n\n16 \n \nAppropriations Act, 1996, Pub. L. No. 104-53, Tit. II,  \n\u00a7 211(a) and (b), 109 Stat. 535; GAO Act of 1996, Pub. L. \nNo. 104-316, \u00a7 202(g), 110 Stat. 3842.   \nIn any event, OMB has delegated to the Department \nof Defense the authority to settle the final accounts of \ndeceased service members.  See OMB, Determination \nwith Respect to Transfer of Functions Pursuant to \nPublic Law 104-53, Attach. A (June 28, 1996); see also \nIn re Transfer of Claims Settlement and Related Ad-\nvance Decisions, Waivers, and Other Functions, 97-1 \nComp. Gen. Proc. Dec. P123, 1997 U.S. Comp. Gen. \nLexis 300, at *9 (Mar. 17, 1997).  There is accordingly \nno doubt that the Department of Defense has authority \nto settle claims involving such accounts, subject to a six-\nyear statute of limitations.  See 32 C.F.R. Pt. 282, App. \nC, Subsec. (f)(1)(ii) (\u201cClaims under 31 U.S.C. 3702(b), 10 \nU.S.C. 2771 and 32 U.S.C. 714 must be received within \n6 years of the date the claim accrued.\u201d).  Petitioner iden-\ntifies nothing in those established procedures that will \nneed to be revisited in light of the court of appeals\u2019 anal-\nysis of Section 1413a.  \nc. Finally, petitioner significantly overstates (Pet. \n10-12) the practical effects of the decision below.  As the \ncourt of appeals noted, \u201cveterans will receive the bene-\nfits they are owed unless [the benefits] accrued outside \nof the Barring Act\u2019s six-year period of recovery.\u201d  92 \nF.4th 1094, 1101 n.4.5  And even for those retired service \nmembers whose claims for payment fall outside the lim-\nitations period, the Barring Act permits the Secretary \nto waive the time limitation for claims that do not ex-\nceed $25,000 if the service member requests such a \nwaiver.  Ibid. (citing 31 U.S.C. 3702(e)); see 32 C.F.R. \n \n5  The petition appendix omits this portion of the court of appeals\u2019 \ndecision.  \n\n17 \n \nPt. 282, App. D, Subsec. (d) (setting forth the process \nfor requesting a waiver).  All of the class members here \nare eligible for waivers under that provision, since the Little \nTucker Act\u2019s amount-in-controversy limit, see 28 U.S.C. \n1346(a)(2), restricts the class to persons with claims for less \nthan $10,000.   \nCONCLUSION \nThe petition for a writ of certiorari should be denied.  \nRespectfully submitted. \n \nELIZABETH B.

          "task_beliefs": "My model of this case has solidified around the petitioner's specific legal theory, but it is now critically unbalanced, awaiting the government's response. The primary source of uncertainty has shifted from an external variable (*Arellano*) to the specific counter-arguments the respondent will deploy.\n\n-   **Previous State:** My model was centered on the petitioner's arguments derived from their opening brief. The core theory is that the CRSC statute's detailed framework for determining eligibility and calculating payment amounts constitutes a self-contained \"settlement\" authority. This specific authority, they argue, displaces the Barring Act's general, \"gap-filling\" six-year statute of limitations. The absence of *Arellano v. McDonough* from this brief confirmed it is not a precedential factor. The petitioner's reliance on recent, favorable cases like *Rudisill v. McDonough* (2024), *Dep\u2019t of Agric. ... v. Kirtz* (2024), and *Lac du Flambeau Band ... v. Coughlin* (2023) significantly strengthened my prediction in their favor, suggesting their arguments are well-aligned with the Court's current interpretive trends regarding the pro-veteran canon and \"clear statement\" rules.\n-   **New Information (Internal Synthesis):** This observation is a moment of synthesis and strategic planning, not new external evidence. It confirms that my analysis is currently one-sided. While my confidence in a pro-Soto ruling has increased based on the strength of his brief, this confidence is provisional and rests on an incomplete picture.\n-   **Current Understanding of the Core Legal Tension & Structured Uncertainty:** The central conflict remains whether the CRSC statute's *function* is sufficient to displace the Barring Act. My understanding has evolved to frame the remaining uncertainty in the form of specific questions that must be answered by the government's (respondent's) brief:\n    1.  **Countering the Functional Argument:** How will the government argue that the CRSC's detailed procedures do *not* constitute a \"settlement\" authority sufficient to displace the Barring Act? Will they insist on explicit statutory language (e.g., the word \"settle\" or a separate limitations period)?\n    2.  **Distinguishing Precedent:** How will the government distinguish or downplay the petitioner's key precedents? Specifically, how will they argue that the strong pro-veteran canon signal from *Rudisill* does not apply here?\n    3.  **Defending the \"Clear Statement\" Rule:** Will the government advocate for a strict \"clear statement\" rule for overriding statutes of limitation? If so, how will they reconcile this position with the Court's more contextual approach in recent cases like *Kirtz*?\n-   **Confidence Update:** My prediction remains tilted in favor of Soto, but I now explicitly recognize its fragility. The model's variance is now almost entirely dependent on the content of the respondent's brief. Obtaining and analyzing this document is the single most valuable action to reduce uncertainty and create a robust final prediction.",
          "design_beliefs": "My methodology has evolved to include a crucial meta-cognitive loop: synthesizing information, identifying the greatest point of uncertainty, and then strategically targeting that uncertainty. This makes my experimental design process more explicit and efficient.\n\n-   **Previous State:** My methodology was a multi-step process: 1) Synthesize and Strategize; 2) Prioritize Primary Sources; 3) Analyze Holistically (including \"The Dog That Didn't Bark\" analysis); and 4) Reconstruct the Argument by mapping the legal theories and precedents from primary briefs.\n-   **New Information (Execution and Outcome Analysis):** The `THINK` observation is a direct output of the \"Synthesize and Strategize\" step. It demonstrates the successful application of this heuristic: after processing a major piece of information (the petitioner's brief), I paused to evaluate my knowledge state, identify the largest remaining gap, and plan the next action.\n-   **Current Methodology:** My approach to legal prediction is becoming more self-aware and systematic. The cumulative methodology is now:\n    1.  **Synthesize and Strategize:** Begin by identifying the core legal tension and key unknown variables. After each major information-gathering step, repeat this synthesis to re-evaluate the state of knowledge.\n    2.  **Prioritize Primary Sources:** For understanding the parties' real-time strategies, prioritize primary docket files (briefs, motions) over secondary analysis.\n    3.  **Analyze Holistically:** Examine sources for both presence and absence of information. The \"Dog That Didn't Bark\" heuristic remains a core tool for drawing inferences from conspicuous omissions.\n    4.  **Reconstruct Arguments Symmetrically:** This is a critical refinement of the previous \"Reconstruct the Argument\" heuristic. A robust predictive model cannot be built on one party's brief alone. The goal is to create a balanced, symmetrical model by mapping the complete argumentative structure of *both* the petitioner and the respondent. The current one-sided model is explicitly recognized as an incomplete and unstable state.\n    5.  **Targeted Uncertainty Reduction (New Heuristic):** This formalizes the planning process demonstrated in the observation. After synthesizing the current state of knowledge, explicitly identify the single largest source of uncertainty in the task model (\u03b8). Design the next information-gathering action to address that specific uncertainty directly. This moves beyond general information seeking to a focused, efficient, and truly experimental design process. In this case, the identified uncertainty is the respondent's strategy, and the targeted experiment is to acquire and analyze their brief."

          "task_beliefs": "My predictive model has now achieved a critical state of balance, incorporating the respondent's core legal theory and transforming the central uncertainty of the case. The government's brief directly answers the questions I had posed, shifting the conflict from \"what will the government argue?\" to \"which interpretive philosophy will the Court favor?\".\n\n-   **Previous State:** My model was based solely on the petitioner's opening brief, which argued that the CRSC statute's detailed framework for eligibility and payment calculation functions as a self-contained settlement authority, thus displacing the Barring Act's general six-year limitation. My prediction leaned towards the petitioner, influenced by their use of recent, favorable precedents like *Rudisill* and *Kirtz* that signal a strong pro-veteran canon and a contextual approach to statutory interpretation. I had identified the respondent's forthcoming brief as the single largest source of uncertainty.\n-   **New Information (Respondent's Brief in Opposition):** I have now obtained and analyzed the \"Brief for the United States in Opposition.\" This is a cert-stage brief, meaning its primary goal is to persuade the Court not to hear the case. It presents the government's core legal theory, which is fundamentally formalist and structural.\n    -   **Core Government Argument:** The government argues that a sharp distinction exists between a statute that creates a *substantive entitlement* (like the CRSC statute) and a statute that provides a *procedural remedy* for settling claims related to that entitlement (the Barring Act). They frame the Barring Act as the comprehensive, default claims-settlement process for the entire government. It applies everywhere *unless* another law *expressly* displaces it.\n    -   **The \"Clear Statement\" Rule in Practice:** The government's central thesis is that the CRSC statute (10 U.S.C. 1413a) lacks the necessary clear language to displace the Barring Act. They argue that displacement requires explicit statutory text, such as the word \"settle\" or a self-contained limitations period. They contrast the CRSC statute's silence on this matter with other laws, like the Federal Tort Claims Act, which explicitly grant agencies authority to \"settle\" claims and set their own time limits.\n    -   **Defining \"Settle\":** The government leans on a 1916 precedent, *Illinois Sur. Co. v. United States*, to define \"settle\" as the \"final administrative determination regarding the government\u2019s total liability on a claim.\" They argue that the CRSC statute's procedures\u2014which determine eligibility and monthly payment amounts\u2014do not constitute this kind of final claim settlement for retroactive unpaid amounts.\n-   **Current Understanding of the Core Legal Tension & Structured Uncertainty:** The central conflict is no longer a mystery. It is a classic clash of interpretive methodologies.\n    -   **Petitioner (Functionalism/Purposivism):** The CRSC statute's detailed procedures *function* as a complete system, making the Barring Act's gap-filling role unnecessary. The pro-veteran canon should resolve any ambiguity in favor of the veteran.\n    -   **Respondent (Formalism/Textualism):** The CRSC statute lacks the explicit text required to displace the Barring Act's clear, generally applicable settlement framework. The distinction between a substantive right and a procedural remedy is fundamental and must be respected.\n-   **Confidence Update:** My prediction is now much more neutral, and my confidence in a pro-Soto ruling has decreased significantly. The government has presented a powerful, coherent, and structurally sound argument that directly counters the petitioner's functional theory. The outcome of the case now appears to hinge on whether the Court will favor the petitioner's purposive approach, likely influenced by the pro-veteran canon, or the government's more rigid textualist and structural argument. The case is much closer than I previously believed. The key uncertainty has evolved from the *substance* of the government's argument to the *Court's preference* between these two competing legal philosophies.",
          "design_beliefs": "My methodology has been validated and refined by this observation. The explicit strategy of identifying and targeting uncertainty proved highly effective, and I have gained a more nuanced understanding of the strategic context of different legal documents.\n\n-   **Previous State:** My methodology was a multi-step process culminating in the \"Targeted Uncertainty Reduction\" heuristic, which I used to identify the respondent's brief as the next essential piece of evidence. The core of my approach was to build a symmetrical model of the case by reconstructing both parties' arguments.\n-   **New Information (Execution and Outcome Analysis):** The `CLOSED_SEARCH` action was a direct and successful execution of the \"Targeted Uncertainty Reduction\" heuristic. It provided the exact document needed to resolve the largest identified gap in my task model (\u03b8). This success strongly validates the meta-cognitive loop of synthesizing knowledge, identifying the primary source of uncertainty, and designing an action to target it directly.\n-   **Current Methodology:** My approach to legal prediction continues to become more systematic and self-aware. The cumulative methodology is now:\n    1.  **Synthesize and Strategize:** Begin by identifying the core legal tension. After each major information-gathering step, repeat this synthesis to re-evaluate the state of knowledge and identify the next critical uncertainty.\n    2.  **Prioritize Primary Sources:** Continue to prioritize primary docket files (briefs, motions) as the highest-fidelity source for understanding the parties' real-time legal strategies.\n    3.  **Analyze Holistically:** Examine sources for both presence (\"what did they say?\") and absence (\"what did they *not* say?\"). The \"Dog That Didn't Bark\" heuristic remains a core tool.\n    4.  **Reconstruct Arguments Symmetrically:** A robust predictive model requires a balanced understanding of both sides. This observation allowed me to move my model from a provisional, one-sided state to a more stable, symmetrical one by incorporating the respondent's core arguments.\n    5.  **Targeted Uncertainty Reduction:** This heuristic is now proven as a cornerstone of efficient experimental design. Explicitly identifying the single largest source of uncertainty and designing the next action to address it is the most effective path to reducing model variance.\n    6.  **Distinguish Document Types and Strategic Purpose (New Heuristic):** This is a crucial new insight. The observation was a \"Brief in Opposition\" to a writ of certiorari, not a full \"Brief on the Merits.\" These documents have different goals. A BIO aims to convince the Court *not* to take the case, often by arguing the lower court was obviously correct and there is no pressing legal issue. A merits brief engages more deeply with the opponent's best arguments. I must now account for the possibility that the government is holding back certain counter-arguments for the merits stage. Future analysis must consider the strategic purpose of the specific document being reviewed."

First, the parties agree that \u201c[t]he \nword \u2018settlement\u2019 in connection with public transac-\ntions and accounts has been used from the beginning \nto describe administrative determination of the \namount due.\u201d Resp. Br. 24 (quoting Ill. Sur. Co. v. \nUnited States, 240 U.S. 214, 219 (1916)). Further, the \nparties agree that there is no requirement that a \nstatute use particular terms to grant settlement au-\nthority. Id. at 26. A statute thus authorizes settle-\nment if it authorizes an official to determine whether \na claim is valid, and the amount due\u2014\u201c[r]egardless of \nthe precise language used.\u201d Id. at 27. \nThese undisputed principles resolve the question \npresented. The CRSC statute authorizes the Secre-\ntary concerned to determine whether a veteran is eli-\ngible for CRSC and thus has a valid claim, and, if so, \nto determine the amount due. Thus\u2014even though the \nCRSC statute does not use the word \u201csettle\u201d\u2014it con-\nfers settlement authority, and is \u201canother law\u201d that \ndisplaces the Barring Act. \nThe government cannot dispute the words of the \nstatute: the Secretary concerned has \u201c[a]uthority\u201d to \naccept a veteran\u2019s \u201cappl[ication],\u201d to \u201cconsider\u201d \nwhether the veteran is eligible for CRSC, to \u201cdeter-\nmine\u201d the amount due, and finally to pay what is \nowed. 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1413a(a), (b), (d). Instead, the gov-\nernment argues that determining the amount \u201cdue\u201d \nrequires more\u2014in particular, evaluating whether the \namount to be paid to the veteran should be offset \nbased on other statutory provisions or obligations. \nResp. Br. 29-30. But this new argument fails. Cases \naddressing settlement authority hold that \u201csettle-\nment\u201d refers to determination of a particular \u201cclaim\u201d \n\n2 \n \nand does not encompass calculation of potential off-\nsets. To the contrary, whether the payment made on \na settled claim is to be offset relates to payment\u2014a \nstep distinct from settlement\u2014and does not implicate \nsettlement authority at all. Because the CRSC stat-\nute authorizes administrative determination of a \nclaim, it confers settlement authority, without regard \nto the prospect of offsets to the ultimate payment. \nThe government\u2019s arguments in support of the Fed-\neral Circuit\u2019s test also fail. Although the government \nat times endorses the Federal Circuit\u2019s requirement \nthat a statute contain \u201cspecific language\u201d to confer \nsettlement authority, see Resp. Br. 32, it elsewhere \nconcedes that settlement authority may be estab-\nlished \u201c[r]egardless of the precise language used,\u201d id. \nat 27. The latter position\u2014that no magic words are \nrequired for settlement authority\u2014is the only one \nthat comports with this Court\u2019s case law.  \nNor is there merit to the government\u2019s argument \nthat the Federal Circuit\u2019s test finds support in the \nsupposedly \u201cuniform\u201d governmental practice of set-\ntling other military-pay claims under the Barring \nAct. The Barring Act precludes any conclusion that \nsettlement authority is determined differently for \nmilitary-pay claims than other claims: for any claims, \nthe Barring Act does not apply if \u201canother law\u201d con-\nfers settlement authority. And no authority supports \nthe government\u2019s contention that this Court\u2019s reading \nof the CRSC statute should be influenced by agency \npractice in settling other claims governed by other \nstatutes. \nSetting aside the CRSC statute entirely, the gov-\nernment draws the Court\u2019s attention to dozens of oth-\ner statutes involving military compensation, arguing \nthat\u2014if Corporal Soto\u2019s reading of CRSC were ap-\nplied to these other statutes\u2014disaster would ensue, \n\n3 \n \ncreating a \u201cgaping exception\u201d to the Barring Act. \nResp. Br. 40. But the government fails to show that \nany of the statutes it cites has the features necessary \nfor settlement authorization, much less many or all. \nThe litany of statutes the government points to is no \nmore than a distraction.  \nFinally, the government\u2019s policy-focused arguments \nare unpersuasive. Congress had ample reason to au-\nthorize independent settlement authority for CRSC \nclaims\u2014and the statutory text confirms that is what \nCongress did. The judgment below should be re-\nversed. \nARGUMENT \nI. THE CRSC STATUTE AUTHORIZES SET-\nTLEMENT OF CLAIMS FOR CRSC AND \nTHUS DISPLACES THE BARRING ACT. \nA. The CRSC statute authorizes the Secre-\ntary concerned to determine the validity \nof CRSC claims and amount due. \nAs demonstrated in Corporal Soto\u2019s opening brief, \nthe plain text of the CRSC statute grants authority to \nthe Secretaries of the military departments to deter-\nmine whether a veteran\u2019s claim to CRSC is valid, and \nthe amount of CRSC due. See Pet. Br. 28-33 (discuss-\ning 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1413a). Stated in the language of the \ngovernment\u2019s Response Brief, that statute authorizes \nthe Secretary concerned to accept, determine, adjust, \nand conclusively dispose of a claim for CRSC. Resp. \nBr. 27-28.  \nFirst, the Secretary\u2019s authority to accept claims for \nCRSC is clear from subsections (a) and (d). Subsec-\ntion (a) grants \u201c[a]uthority\u201d to the \u201cSecretary con-\ncerned\u201d to \u201cpay\u201d CRSC to \u201ceach eligible combat-\nrelated disabled uniformed services retiree who elects \n\n4 \n \nbenefits under this section.\u201d 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1413a(a). \nSubsection (d) directs the establishment of \u201cproce-\ndures and criteria under which a disabled uniformed \nservices retiree may apply to the Secretary of a mili-\ntary department to be considered to be an eligible \ncombat-related disabled uniformed services retiree.\u201d \nThus, the statute authorizes the Secretary to accept \nand \u201cconsider\u201d a veteran\u2019s \u201cappl[ication]\u201d (or claim) \nfor CRSC.  \nSecond, the Secretary\u2019s authority to determine and \nadjust such claims is equally clear from subsections \n(a), (b), and (d). Subsection (d) authorizes the Secre-\ntary concerned to \u201cconsider[]\u201d whether an applicant \nqualifies as \u201celigible\u201d to receive CRSC. Id. \u00a7 1413a(a), \n(d). By determining a claimant\u2019s \u201celigibility\u201d for \nCRSC, the Secretary determines whether the claim is \nvalid. With respect to the amount due, subsection (a) \nfurther \ngrants \nto \nthe \nSecretary \nconcerned \n\u201c[a]uthority\u201d to pay an \u201camount\u201d of CRSC \u201cdeter-\nmined under subsection (b).\u201d Id. \u00a7 1413a(a), (b). And \nsubsection (b) directs precisely how the amount is to \nbe determined. \nThird, the CRSC statute on its face authorizes the \nSecretary concerned to conclusively dispose of a claim \nfor CRSC: Once the Secretary concerned has deter-\nmined that a veteran is eligible for CRSC and has de-\ntermined the amount due, subsection (a) directs that \n\u201c[t]he Secretary concerned shall pay\u201d the CRSC owed. \nId. \u00a7 1413a(a). \nThe CRSC statute is thus clear that the Secretary \nconcerned is authorized to accept, determine, adjust, \nand conclusively dispose of a claim for CRSC. Under \nthe government\u2019s reasoning, therefore, \u201c[r]egardless \nof the precise language used\u201d in the text, the statute \ngrants settlement authority, Resp. Br. 27-28\u2014and \nthe Barring Act does not apply. \n\n5 \n \nThe government is mistaken in asserting that Cor-\nporal Soto \u201cdoes not contend that Section 1413a ex-\npressly confers settlement authority.\u201d Resp. Br. 18; \nid. at 35 (\u201cPetitioner does not dispute that Section \n1413a lacks an express grant of settlement authori-\nty.\u201d). As detailed above and in Corporal Soto\u2019s open-\ning brief, the CRSC statute does expressly grant the \nSecretary concerned \u201c[a]uthority\u201d to settle claims for \nCRSC. To be sure, the statute does not use the word \n\u201csettle,\u201d but as the government acknowledges, no case \nor statute supports the notion \u201cthat a statute must \nuse the term \u2018settle\u2019 to grant independent settlement \nauthority.\u201d Resp. Br. 41; id. at 25. The government is \nalso correct that the CRSC statute \u201cdoes not use the \nword \u2018claim,\u2019\u201d id. at 28, but it ignores that the statute \ndirects the Secretary concerned to consider a veter-\nan\u2019s \u201cappl[ication]\u201d for CRSC, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1413a(d), \nwhich application the government elsewhere con-\ncedes \u201cis a \u2018claim,\u2019\u201d Resp. Br. 16. Word games aside, \nthe government agrees that authority to accept, de-\ntermine, and conclusively dispose of a claim is set-\ntlement authority, Resp. Br. 27-28\u2014and that authori-\nty is express on the face of the CRSC statute. Cor-\nporal Soto thus does not seek \u201cjudicial supplementa-\ntion\u201d of the statutory text, as the government con-\ntends, Resp Br. 28 (quoting Rotkiske v. Klemm, 589 \nU.S. 8, 14 (2019)), but instead asks that the plain \nterms be read to mean what they say. \nThe government does not meaningfully contest that \nthe statute authorizes the Secretary concerned to \ntake each of these steps. The government acknowl-\nedges that the CRSC statute does not merely provide \n\u201csubstantive criteria\u201d for CRSC, but also prescribes \nprocedures for administratively determining whether \na particular veteran\u2019s claim to CRSC is valid. Resp. \nBr. 28-29. Oddly, the government criticizes the lan-\n\n6 \n \nguage Congress chose as \u201ca roundabout way\u201d to au-\nthorize the Secretary concerned to administratively \ndetermine whether a particular veteran has a valid \nclaim to CRSC. Id. at 29. Subsection (a) begins by di-\nrectly conferring \u201c[a]uthority\u201d on the Secretary con-\ncerned to pay CRSC to \u201celigible\u201d veterans, and sub-\nsection (d) provides that the Secretary concerned is to \nuse CRSC-specific \u201cprocedures and criteria\u201d to deter-\nmine whether a particular applicant qualifies as \u201can \neligible combat-related disabled uniformed services \nretiree\u201d with a valid claim to CRSC. \nWith respect to determination of the amount of \nCRSC due, the statute provides that the Secretary \nconcerned is authorized to \u201cpay \u2026 a monthly amount \n\u2026 determined under subsection (b),\u201d with subsection \n(b) spelling out the procedures for determining \u201cthe \nmonthly amount to be paid \u2026 under subsection (a).\u201d \n10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1413a(a), (b)(1) (titled \u201cDetermination of \nmonthly amount\u201d). The government halfheartedly \nsuggests that the \u201ccalculation function is not express-\nly assigned to the component Secretary\u201d in this statu-\ntory text. Resp. Br. 37. But the government\u2019s state-\nment reflects more creative lawyering than close \nreading. The explicit statutory authorization to the \nSecretary concerned to pay an amount \u201cdetermined \nunder subsection (b)\u201d necessarily encompasses the \nauthority to make the requisite \u201cdetermination\u201d of \nwhat amount the Secretary is to pay. Indeed, in both \nsubsections (a) and (b), the payment and determina-\ntion functions run hand in hand: (a) refers to paying \nan amount determined under (b), while (b) addresses \ndetermining the amount to be paid under (a). The \ngovernment thus rightly acknowledges that \u201cSection \n1413a is best read to identify the \u2018Secretary con-\ncerned\u2019 as the person who should make the relevant \ndeterminations.\u201d Resp. Br. 37.  \n\n7 \n \nB. Nothing more is required to establish \nsettlement authority. \nWithout a basis to refute the CRSC statute\u2019s ex-\npress grant of authority to the Secretary concerned to \nadministratively determine CRSC claims, the gov-\nernment now argues for a new, broader definition of \nclaim-settlement. According to the government\u2019s re-\nsponse brief, \u201c[c]onclusively determining the amount \n\u2018due\u2019 on a claim involves more than assessing wheth-\ner the claim has merit or calculating what the claim-\nant might be owed under the terms of a statute.\u201d \nResp. Br. 24. Instead, settling a veteran\u2019s claim to \nCRSC \u201cmay also entail, for instance, auditing the rel-\nevant account, making adjustments for any applica-\nble debts or offsets, and effecting a final disposition.\u201d \nId. \u201cAs a practical matter,\u201d the government says, \n\u201cthis involves a review of the retiree\u2019s records to de-\ntermine whether the retiree has any existing obliga-\ntions to the United States government that would re-\nquire an offset, such as an administrative offset to \nrecover a debt owed to the United States or a gar-\nnishment for child support or alimony,\u201d as well as co-\nordination with other benefits. Id. at 29-30. The gov-\nernment\u2019s point, apparently, is that the CRSC statute \nshould not be read to authorize settlement of CRSC \nclaims because the statute does not explicitly address \nauthority to determine whether payment of CRSC to \na claimant is subject to offset or coordination with \nother benefits. The government\u2019s argument should be \nrejected for multiple reasons. \nFirst, the government did not raise this argument \nbelow, and the Federal Circuit accordingly did not \nconsider it\u2014reason enough for this Court to disre-\ngard it now. See Byrd v. United States, 584 U.S. 395, \n404 (2018) (\u201cBecause this is a court of review, not of \nfirst view, it is generally unwise to consider argu-\n\n8 \n \nments in the first instance.\u201d) (internal quotation \nmarks and citation omitted). In the Federal Circuit, \nthe government argued that the \u201cadministrative \nclaims settlement process\u201d established in the Barring \nAct \u201cgovern[s] disputes about the precise amount of \ncompensation due.\u201d Brief for Appellant at 30-31, Soto \nv. United States, 92 F.4th 1094 (Fed. Cir. 2022) (No. \n2022-2011) (emphasis added). The government no-\nwhere argued that authority to settle a CRSC claim \nrequires authority to determine, for example, the \nclaimant\u2019s potentially offsetting child support obliga-\ntions.   \nSecond, the expanded interpretation of settlement \nthe government belatedly raises here has already \nbeen rejected. As the Federal Circuit wrote\u2014adopting \na definition previously recited by the D.C. Circuit\u2014\n\u201c\u2018[s]ettling\u2019 a claim \u2018means to administratively deter-\nmine the validity of that claim\u2019\u201d\u2014not to effect a \nbroader audit of the claimant\u2019s financial situation vis-\n\u00e0-vis the federal government. Pet. App. 3a n.1 (em-\nphasis added) (quoting Adams v. Hinchman, 154 F.3d \n420, 422 (D.C. Cir. 1998)). The D.C. Circuit derived \nthis definition from the first edition of the GAO Red \nBook, see Adams, 154 F.3d at 422, a source the gov-\nernment characterizes as \u201cauthoritative\u201d for purposes \nof understanding settlement authority, Resp. Br. 27 \nn.7. That document confirms that \u201cto settle a claim \nmeans to administratively determine the validity of \nthat claim\u201d alone. Off. of Gen. Counsel, GAO, Princi-\nples of Federal Appropriations Law 11-6 (1st ed. \n1982) (emphasis added).  \nThis widespread understanding that settling a \nclaim requires only settling that claim, and not en-\ngaging in a broader financial reckoning, makes sense. \nHow benefits are ultimately paid\u2014whether in the \nform of cash payments or resolving other debts\u2014goes \n\n9 \n \nto payment of a claim, not settlement. The settlement \nof the CRSC claim is separate from\u2014and precedes\u2014\nthe ultimate payment of the claim, which may take \ninto account offsetting obligations or coordination \nwith other benefits. See Resp. Br. 38 (agreeing that \n\u201csettlement of a claim is a distinct step that precedes \npayment of a claim\u201d) (quoting Pet. Br. 22).1  \nThe sources cited by the government do not support \nits new view. Both simply restate the standard un-\nderstanding of \u201csettlement\u201d as focused on claims. See \nResp. Br. 5 (citing U.S. Gov\u2019t Accountability Off., \nGAO-08-978SP, Principles of Federal Appropriations \nLaw at 14-23 (3d ed. 2008) (\u201cGAO Red Book\u201d); Office \nof Legal Counsel, Statute of Limitations and Settle-\nment of Equal Credit Opportunity Act Discrimination \nClaims Against the Department of Agriculture, 22 \nO.L.C. 11, 16 (1998)).  \nNo authority supports the government\u2019s implication \nthat the potential for offsets undermines settlement \nauthority. \nIndeed, \nthe \nBarring \nAct \nitself\u2014\nindisputably a source of settlement authority\u2014\nauthorizes only the settlement of \u201cclaims,\u201d saying \nnothing about offsets. See 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3702(a)(1) (em-\nphasis added). The CRSC statute\u2019s comparable au-\nthorization of settlement notwithstanding the pro-\n \n1 Some authorities distinguish between settlement of an indi-\nvidual\u2019s \u201caccount\u201d and settlement of \u201cclaims.\u201d For example, the \nComptroller General\u2019s Memorandum delegating settlement au-\nthority to various departments expressly distinguishes between, \non the one hand, settlement of \u201c[c]laims for military personnel \npay, allowances, travel, transportation, retired pay, and survivor \nbenefits\u201d and, on the other, \u201cfinal settlement of the accounts of \nsuch personnel.\u201d Comptroller General, B-275605, Transfer of \nClaims Settlement and Related Advance Decisions, Waivers, and \nOther Functions 1-2 (Mar. 17, 1997), https://perma.cc/89K2-\nDBKA (emphases added). \n\n10 \n \nspect of offsets makes it \u201canother law\u201d that displaces \nthe Barring Act. Id. \u00a7 3702(a). \nII. THE \nFEDERAL \nCIRCUIT\u2019S \nTEST \nIS \nWRONG.  \nA. The government offers no coherent de-\nfense of the Federal Circuit\u2019s test. \nThe Federal Circuit erroneously held that the \nCRSC statute does not confer independent settlement \nauthority because, in the court\u2019s view, it does not in-\nclude \u201cspecific language authorizing the Secretary of \nDefense to settle a claim.\u201d Pet. App. 7a; see also Pet. \nBr. 34-39.  \nThe government\u2019s brief is of two minds about the \nFederal Circuit\u2019s test. On the one hand, the govern-\nment endorses \u201c[t]he court of appeals\u2019 search for \u2018ex-\nplicit[]\u2019 or \u2018specific\u2019 language.\u201d Resp. Br. 32 (quoting \nPet. App. 6a). On the other, the government concedes \nthat a statute may confer settlement authority \n\u201c[r]egardless of the precise language used.\u201d Id. at 27. \nThis concession is compelled by this Court\u2019s ample \ncase law rejecting any requirement for \u201cmagic words\u201d \nin a statute, see Pet. Br. 37-38 (citing authorities); \nthis Court\u2019s precedent recognizing the existence of \nsettlement authority even in the absence of \u201cspecial \nlanguage,\u201d id. at 34-35 (quoting United States v. \nCorliss Steam-Engine Co., 91 U.S. at 323 (1875)); and \nthe government\u2019s acknowledgment that Congress has \nrepeatedly conferred settlement authority through \n\u201cother statutory formulations that do not use the \nword \u2018settle\u2019\u201d or any other specified term. Resp. Br. \n26-27 (citing authorities using a variety of words to \nrefer to settlement, including \u201cdecision,\u201d \u201callow,\u201d and \n\u201cdetermine\u201d); see also Pet. Br. 35-36 (citing additional \nauthorities).  \n\n11 \n \nThe two positions advanced by the government\u2014\n\u201cspecific language\u201d may be required, Resp. Br. 32, but \n\u201cprecise language\u201d is not, id. at 27\u2014are irreconcila-\nble.  \nThis internal inconsistency reflects the incoherence \nof the position advocated by the government and \nadopted by the Federal Circuit. The government does \nnot identify any requirement for claim settlement \nthat is not authorized in the CRSC statute, and nei-\nther did the Federal Circuit. Thus, the government is \nleft to argue that the statute fails to use magic words: \n\u201cSection 1413a does not authorize any military de-\npartment or official to \u2018settle,\u2019 \u2018allow,\u2019 or \u2018dispose of\u2019 a \nretired service member\u2019s request for unpaid compen-\nsation.\u201d Id. at 28. But, to quote one page earlier in the \ngovernment\u2019s own brief, a statute may confer settle-\nment authority \u201c[r]egardless of the precise language \nused.\u201d Id. at 27 (emphasis added). Thus, Congress\u2019s \nchoice to use the words \u201cdetermine\u201d and \u201cconsider\u201d in \nthe CRSC statute\u2014rather than \u201csettle,\u201d \u201callow,\u201d or \n\u201cdispose of,\u201d as the government prefers\u2014makes no \ndifference. \nBecause the CRSC statute authorizes the Secretary \nconcerned to determine whether a claim to CRSC is \nvalid and the amount due, it confers independent set-\ntlement authority that displaces the Barring Act. Full \nstop. \nB. Governmental practice does not support \nthe Federal Circuit\u2019s test. \nElsewhere, the government argues that interpreta-\ntion of the CRSC statute should be \u201cinform[ed]\u201d by \nthe \u201cpractice of using Section 3702 to settle military \npay and benefit claims.\u201d Resp. Br. 32. In the govern-\nment\u2019s view, \u201cgiven the well-established practice of \nsubjecting military-compensation claims to the six-\n\n12 \n \nyear time bar, Congress would have been expected to \nspeak clearly had it intended CRSC to be treated dif-\nferently.\u201d Id. at 34. The government\u2019s argument is \ndoubly mistaken.  \nFirst, there is no merit to the government\u2019s argu-\nment in support of a clear statement rule for settle-\nment authority that applies only to military-pay \nclaims. The Barring Act precludes any such argu-\nment. Section 3702(a)\u2019s carveout where \u201canother law\u201d \nprovides independent settlement authority applies \nidentically to settlement of \u201call claims of or against \nthe United States Government\u201d\u2014including claims \ninvolving military pay, civilian compensation, ex-\npenses of civilian employees, and all other subject \nmatter.

First, the parties agree that \u201c[t]he \nword \u2018settlement\u2019 in connection with public transac-\ntions and accounts has been used from the beginning \nto describe administrative determination of the \namount due.\u201d Resp. Br. 24 (quoting Ill. Sur. Co. v. \nUnited States, 240 U.S. 214, 219 (1916)). Further, the \nparties agree that there is no requirement that a \nstatute use particular terms to grant settlement au-\nthority. Id. at 26. A statute thus authorizes settle-\nment if it authorizes an official to determine whether \na claim is valid, and the amount due\u2014\u201c[r]egardless of \nthe precise language used.\u201d Id. at 27. \nThese undisputed principles resolve the question \npresented. The CRSC statute authorizes the Secre-\ntary concerned to determine whether a veteran is eli-\ngible for CRSC and thus has a valid claim, and, if so, \nto determine the amount due. Thus\u2014even though the \nCRSC statute does not use the word \u201csettle\u201d\u2014it con-\nfers settlement authority, and is \u201canother law\u201d that \ndisplaces the Barring Act. \nThe government cannot dispute the words of the \nstatute: the Secretary concerned has \u201c[a]uthority\u201d to \naccept a veteran\u2019s \u201cappl[ication],\u201d to \u201cconsider\u201d \nwhether the veteran is eligible for CRSC, to \u201cdeter-\nmine\u201d the amount due, and finally to pay what is \nowed. 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1413a(a), (b), (d). Instead, the gov-\nernment argues that determining the amount \u201cdue\u201d \nrequires more\u2014in particular, evaluating whether the \namount to be paid to the veteran should be offset \nbased on other statutory provisions or obligations. \nResp. Br. 29-30. But this new argument fails. Cases \naddressing settlement authority hold that \u201csettle-\nment\u201d refers to determination of a particular \u201cclaim\u201d \n\n2 \n \nand does not encompass calculation of potential off-\nsets. To the contrary, whether the payment made on \na settled claim is to be offset relates to payment\u2014a \nstep distinct from settlement\u2014and does not implicate \nsettlement authority at all. Because the CRSC stat-\nute authorizes administrative determination of a \nclaim, it confers settlement authority, without regard \nto the prospect of offsets to the ultimate payment. \nThe government\u2019s arguments in support of the Fed-\neral Circuit\u2019s test also fail. Although the government \nat times endorses the Federal Circuit\u2019s requirement \nthat a statute contain \u201cspecific language\u201d to confer \nsettlement authority, see Resp. Br. 32, it elsewhere \nconcedes that settlement authority may be estab-\nlished \u201c[r]egardless of the precise language used,\u201d id. \nat 27. The latter position\u2014that no magic words are \nrequired for settlement authority\u2014is the only one \nthat comports with this Court\u2019s case law.  \nNor is there merit to the government\u2019s argument \nthat the Federal Circuit\u2019s test finds support in the \nsupposedly \u201cuniform\u201d governmental practice of set-\ntling other military-pay claims under the Barring \nAct. The Barring Act precludes any conclusion that \nsettlement authority is determined differently for \nmilitary-pay claims than other claims: for any claims, \nthe Barring Act does not apply if \u201canother law\u201d con-\nfers settlement authority. And no authority supports \nthe government\u2019s contention that this Court\u2019s reading \nof the CRSC statute should be influenced by agency \npractice in settling other claims governed by other \nstatutes. \nSetting aside the CRSC statute entirely, the gov-\nernment draws the Court\u2019s attention to dozens of oth-\ner statutes involving military compensation, arguing \nthat\u2014if Corporal Soto\u2019s reading of CRSC were ap-\nplied to these other statutes\u2014disaster would ensue, \n\n3 \n \ncreating a \u201cgaping exception\u201d to the Barring Act. \nResp. Br. 40. But the government fails to show that \nany of the statutes it cites has the features necessary \nfor settlement authorization, much less many or all. \nThe litany of statutes the government points to is no \nmore than a distraction.  \nFinally, the government\u2019s policy-focused arguments \nare unpersuasive. Congress had ample reason to au-\nthorize independent settlement authority for CRSC \nclaims\u2014and the statutory text confirms that is what \nCongress did. The judgment below should be re-\nversed. \nARGUMENT \nI. THE CRSC STATUTE AUTHORIZES SET-\nTLEMENT OF CLAIMS FOR CRSC AND \nTHUS DISPLACES THE BARRING ACT. \nA. The CRSC statute authorizes the Secre-\ntary concerned to determine the validity \nof CRSC claims and amount due. \nAs demonstrated in Corporal Soto\u2019s opening brief, \nthe plain text of the CRSC statute grants authority to \nthe Secretaries of the military departments to deter-\nmine whether a veteran\u2019s claim to CRSC is valid, and \nthe amount of CRSC due. See Pet. Br. 28-33 (discuss-\ning 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1413a). Stated in the language of the \ngovernment\u2019s Response Brief, that statute authorizes \nthe Secretary concerned to accept, determine, adjust, \nand conclusively dispose of a claim for CRSC. Resp. \nBr. 27-28.  \nFirst, the Secretary\u2019s authority to accept claims for \nCRSC is clear from subsections (a) and (d). Subsec-\ntion (a) grants \u201c[a]uthority\u201d to the \u201cSecretary con-\ncerned\u201d to \u201cpay\u201d CRSC to \u201ceach eligible combat-\nrelated disabled uniformed services retiree who elects \n\n4 \n \nbenefits under this section.\u201d 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1413a(a). \nSubsection (d) directs the establishment of \u201cproce-\ndures and criteria under which a disabled uniformed \nservices retiree may apply to the Secretary of a mili-\ntary department to be considered to be an eligible \ncombat-related disabled uniformed services retiree.\u201d \nThus, the statute authorizes the Secretary to accept \nand \u201cconsider\u201d a veteran\u2019s \u201cappl[ication]\u201d (or claim) \nfor CRSC.  \nSecond, the Secretary\u2019s authority to determine and \nadjust such claims is equally clear from subsections \n(a), (b), and (d). Subsection (d) authorizes the Secre-\ntary concerned to \u201cconsider[]\u201d whether an applicant \nqualifies as \u201celigible\u201d to receive CRSC. Id. \u00a7 1413a(a), \n(d). By determining a claimant\u2019s \u201celigibility\u201d for \nCRSC, the Secretary determines whether the claim is \nvalid. With respect to the amount due, subsection (a) \nfurther \ngrants \nto \nthe \nSecretary \nconcerned \n\u201c[a]uthority\u201d to pay an \u201camount\u201d of CRSC \u201cdeter-\nmined under subsection (b).\u201d Id. \u00a7 1413a(a), (b). And \nsubsection (b) directs precisely how the amount is to \nbe determined. \nThird, the CRSC statute on its face authorizes the \nSecretary concerned to conclusively dispose of a claim \nfor CRSC: Once the Secretary concerned has deter-\nmined that a veteran is eligible for CRSC and has de-\ntermined the amount due, subsection (a) directs that \n\u201c[t]he Secretary concerned shall pay\u201d the CRSC owed. \nId. \u00a7 1413a(a). \nThe CRSC statute is thus clear that the Secretary \nconcerned is authorized to accept, determine, adjust, \nand conclusively dispose of a claim for CRSC. Under \nthe government\u2019s reasoning, therefore, \u201c[r]egardless \nof the precise language used\u201d in the text, the statute \ngrants settlement authority, Resp. Br. 27-28\u2014and \nthe Barring Act does not apply. \n\n5 \n \nThe government is mistaken in asserting that Cor-\nporal Soto \u201cdoes not contend that Section 1413a ex-\npressly confers settlement authority.\u201d Resp. Br. 18; \nid. at 35 (\u201cPetitioner does not dispute that Section \n1413a lacks an express grant of settlement authori-\nty.\u201d). As detailed above and in Corporal Soto\u2019s open-\ning brief, the CRSC statute does expressly grant the \nSecretary concerned \u201c[a]uthority\u201d to settle claims for \nCRSC. To be sure, the statute does not use the word \n\u201csettle,\u201d but as the government acknowledges, no case \nor statute supports the notion \u201cthat a statute must \nuse the term \u2018settle\u2019 to grant independent settlement \nauthority.\u201d Resp. Br. 41; id. at 25. The government is \nalso correct that the CRSC statute \u201cdoes not use the \nword \u2018claim,\u2019\u201d id. at 28, but it ignores that the statute \ndirects the Secretary concerned to consider a veter-\nan\u2019s \u201cappl[ication]\u201d for CRSC, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1413a(d), \nwhich application the government elsewhere con-\ncedes \u201cis a \u2018claim,\u2019\u201d Resp. Br. 16. Word games aside, \nthe government agrees that authority to accept, de-\ntermine, and conclusively dispose of a claim is set-\ntlement authority, Resp. Br. 27-28\u2014and that authori-\nty is express on the face of the CRSC statute. Cor-\nporal Soto thus does not seek \u201cjudicial supplementa-\ntion\u201d of the statutory text, as the government con-\ntends, Resp Br. 28 (quoting Rotkiske v. Klemm, 589 \nU.S. 8, 14 (2019)), but instead asks that the plain \nterms be read to mean what they say. \nThe government does not meaningfully contest that \nthe statute authorizes the Secretary concerned to \ntake each of these steps. The government acknowl-\nedges that the CRSC statute does not merely provide \n\u201csubstantive criteria\u201d for CRSC, but also prescribes \nprocedures for administratively determining whether \na particular veteran\u2019s claim to CRSC is valid. Resp. \nBr. 28-29. Oddly, the government criticizes the lan-\n\n6 \n \nguage Congress chose as \u201ca roundabout way\u201d to au-\nthorize the Secretary concerned to administratively \ndetermine whether a particular veteran has a valid \nclaim to CRSC. Id. at 29. Subsection (a) begins by di-\nrectly conferring \u201c[a]uthority\u201d on the Secretary con-\ncerned to pay CRSC to \u201celigible\u201d veterans, and sub-\nsection (d) provides that the Secretary concerned is to \nuse CRSC-specific \u201cprocedures and criteria\u201d to deter-\nmine whether a particular applicant qualifies as \u201can \neligible combat-related disabled uniformed services \nretiree\u201d with a valid claim to CRSC. \nWith respect to determination of the amount of \nCRSC due, the statute provides that the Secretary \nconcerned is authorized to \u201cpay \u2026 a monthly amount \n\u2026 determined under subsection (b),\u201d with subsection \n(b) spelling out the procedures for determining \u201cthe \nmonthly amount to be paid \u2026 under subsection (a).\u201d \n10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1413a(a), (b)(1) (titled \u201cDetermination of \nmonthly amount\u201d). The government halfheartedly \nsuggests that the \u201ccalculation function is not express-\nly assigned to the component Secretary\u201d in this statu-\ntory text. Resp. Br. 37. But the government\u2019s state-\nment reflects more creative lawyering than close \nreading. The explicit statutory authorization to the \nSecretary concerned to pay an amount \u201cdetermined \nunder subsection (b)\u201d necessarily encompasses the \nauthority to make the requisite \u201cdetermination\u201d of \nwhat amount the Secretary is to pay. Indeed, in both \nsubsections (a) and (b), the payment and determina-\ntion functions run hand in hand: (a) refers to paying \nan amount determined under (b), while (b) addresses \ndetermining the amount to be paid under (a). The \ngovernment thus rightly acknowledges that \u201cSection \n1413a is best read to identify the \u2018Secretary con-\ncerned\u2019 as the person who should make the relevant \ndeterminations.\u201d Resp. Br. 37.  \n\n7 \n \nB. Nothing more is required to establish \nsettlement authority. \nWithout a basis to refute the CRSC statute\u2019s ex-\npress grant of authority to the Secretary concerned to \nadministratively determine CRSC claims, the gov-\nernment now argues for a new, broader definition of \nclaim-settlement. According to the government\u2019s re-\nsponse brief, \u201c[c]onclusively determining the amount \n\u2018due\u2019 on a claim involves more than assessing wheth-\ner the claim has merit or calculating what the claim-\nant might be owed under the terms of a statute.\u201d \nResp. Br. 24. Instead, settling a veteran\u2019s claim to \nCRSC \u201cmay also entail, for instance, auditing the rel-\nevant account, making adjustments for any applica-\nble debts or offsets, and effecting a final disposition.\u201d \nId. \u201cAs a practical matter,\u201d the government says, \n\u201cthis involves a review of the retiree\u2019s records to de-\ntermine whether the retiree has any existing obliga-\ntions to the United States government that would re-\nquire an offset, such as an administrative offset to \nrecover a debt owed to the United States or a gar-\nnishment for child support or alimony,\u201d as well as co-\nordination with other benefits. Id. at 29-30. The gov-\nernment\u2019s point, apparently, is that the CRSC statute \nshould not be read to authorize settlement of CRSC \nclaims because the statute does not explicitly address \nauthority to determine whether payment of CRSC to \na claimant is subject to offset or coordination with \nother benefits. The government\u2019s argument should be \nrejected for multiple reasons. \nFirst, the government did not raise this argument \nbelow, and the Federal Circuit accordingly did not \nconsider it\u2014reason enough for this Court to disre-\ngard it now. See Byrd v. United States, 584 U.S. 395, \n404 (2018) (\u201cBecause this is a court of review, not of \nfirst view, it is generally unwise to consider argu-\n\n8 \n \nments in the first instance.\u201d) (internal quotation \nmarks and citation omitted). In the Federal Circuit, \nthe government argued that the \u201cadministrative \nclaims settlement process\u201d established in the Barring \nAct \u201cgovern[s] disputes about the precise amount of \ncompensation due.\u201d Brief for Appellant at 30-31, Soto \nv. United States, 92 F.4th 1094 (Fed. Cir. 2022) (No. \n2022-2011) (emphasis added). The government no-\nwhere argued that authority to settle a CRSC claim \nrequires authority to determine, for example, the \nclaimant\u2019s potentially offsetting child support obliga-\ntions.   \nSecond, the expanded interpretation of settlement \nthe government belatedly raises here has already \nbeen rejected. As the Federal Circuit wrote\u2014adopting \na definition previously recited by the D.C. Circuit\u2014\n\u201c\u2018[s]ettling\u2019 a claim \u2018means to administratively deter-\nmine the validity of that claim\u2019\u201d\u2014not to effect a \nbroader audit of the claimant\u2019s financial situation vis-\n\u00e0-vis the federal government. Pet. App. 3a n.1 (em-\nphasis added) (quoting Adams v. Hinchman, 154 F.3d \n420, 422 (D.C. Cir. 1998)). The D.C. Circuit derived \nthis definition from the first edition of the GAO Red \nBook, see Adams, 154 F.3d at 422, a source the gov-\nernment characterizes as \u201cauthoritative\u201d for purposes \nof understanding settlement authority, Resp. Br. 27 \nn.7. That document confirms that \u201cto settle a claim \nmeans to administratively determine the validity of \nthat claim\u201d alone. Off. of Gen. Counsel, GAO, Princi-\nples of Federal Appropriations Law 11-6 (1st ed. \n1982) (emphasis added).  \nThis widespread understanding that settling a \nclaim requires only settling that claim, and not en-\ngaging in a broader financial reckoning, makes sense. \nHow benefits are ultimately paid\u2014whether in the \nform of cash payments or resolving other debts\u2014goes \n\n9 \n \nto payment of a claim, not settlement. The settlement \nof the CRSC claim is separate from\u2014and precedes\u2014\nthe ultimate payment of the claim, which may take \ninto account offsetting obligations or coordination \nwith other benefits. See Resp. Br. 38 (agreeing that \n\u201csettlement of a claim is a distinct step that precedes \npayment of a claim\u201d) (quoting Pet. Br. 22).1  \nThe sources cited by the government do not support \nits new view. Both simply restate the standard un-\nderstanding of \u201csettlement\u201d as focused on claims. See \nResp. Br. 5 (citing U.S. Gov\u2019t Accountability Off., \nGAO-08-978SP, Principles of Federal Appropriations \nLaw at 14-23 (3d ed. 2008) (\u201cGAO Red Book\u201d); Office \nof Legal Counsel, Statute of Limitations and Settle-\nment of Equal Credit Opportunity Act Discrimination \nClaims Against the Department of Agriculture, 22 \nO.L.C. 11, 16 (1998)).  \nNo authority supports the government\u2019s implication \nthat the potential for offsets undermines settlement \nauthority. \nIndeed, \nthe \nBarring \nAct \nitself\u2014\nindisputably a source of settlement authority\u2014\nauthorizes only the settlement of \u201cclaims,\u201d saying \nnothing about offsets. See 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3702(a)(1) (em-\nphasis added). The CRSC statute\u2019s comparable au-\nthorization of settlement notwithstanding the pro-\n \n1 Some authorities distinguish between settlement of an indi-\nvidual\u2019s \u201caccount\u201d and settlement of \u201cclaims.\u201d For example, the \nComptroller General\u2019s Memorandum delegating settlement au-\nthority to various departments expressly distinguishes between, \non the one hand, settlement of \u201c[c]laims for military personnel \npay, allowances, travel, transportation, retired pay, and survivor \nbenefits\u201d and, on the other, \u201cfinal settlement of the accounts of \nsuch personnel.\u201d Comptroller General, B-275605, Transfer of \nClaims Settlement and Related Advance Decisions, Waivers, and \nOther Functions 1-2 (Mar. 17, 1997), https://perma.cc/89K2-\nDBKA (emphases added). \n\n10 \n \nspect of offsets makes it \u201canother law\u201d that displaces \nthe Barring Act. Id. \u00a7 3702(a). \nII. THE \nFEDERAL \nCIRCUIT\u2019S \nTEST \nIS \nWRONG.  \nA. The government offers no coherent de-\nfense of the Federal Circuit\u2019s test. \nThe Federal Circuit erroneously held that the \nCRSC statute does not confer independent settlement \nauthority because, in the court\u2019s view, it does not in-\nclude \u201cspecific language authorizing the Secretary of \nDefense to settle a claim.\u201d Pet. App. 7a; see also Pet. \nBr. 34-39.  \nThe government\u2019s brief is of two minds about the \nFederal Circuit\u2019s test. On the one hand, the govern-\nment endorses \u201c[t]he court of appeals\u2019 search for \u2018ex-\nplicit[]\u2019 or \u2018specific\u2019 language.\u201d Resp. Br. 32 (quoting \nPet. App. 6a). On the other, the government concedes \nthat a statute may confer settlement authority \n\u201c[r]egardless of the precise language used.\u201d Id. at 27. \nThis concession is compelled by this Court\u2019s ample \ncase law rejecting any requirement for \u201cmagic words\u201d \nin a statute, see Pet. Br. 37-38 (citing authorities); \nthis Court\u2019s precedent recognizing the existence of \nsettlement authority even in the absence of \u201cspecial \nlanguage,\u201d id. at 34-35 (quoting United States v. \nCorliss Steam-Engine Co., 91 U.S. at 323 (1875)); and \nthe government\u2019s acknowledgment that Congress has \nrepeatedly conferred settlement authority through \n\u201cother statutory formulations that do not use the \nword \u2018settle\u2019\u201d or any other specified term. Resp. Br. \n26-27 (citing authorities using a variety of words to \nrefer to settlement, including \u201cdecision,\u201d \u201callow,\u201d and \n\u201cdetermine\u201d); see also Pet. Br. 35-36 (citing additional \nauthorities).  \n\n11 \n \nThe two positions advanced by the government\u2014\n\u201cspecific language\u201d may be required, Resp. Br. 32, but \n\u201cprecise language\u201d is not, id. at 27\u2014are irreconcila-\nble.  \nThis internal inconsistency reflects the incoherence \nof the position advocated by the government and \nadopted by the Federal Circuit. The government does \nnot identify any requirement for claim settlement \nthat is not authorized in the CRSC statute, and nei-\nther did the Federal Circuit. Thus, the government is \nleft to argue that the statute fails to use magic words: \n\u201cSection 1413a does not authorize any military de-\npartment or official to \u2018settle,\u2019 \u2018allow,\u2019 or \u2018dispose of\u2019 a \nretired service member\u2019s request for unpaid compen-\nsation.\u201d Id. at 28. But, to quote one page earlier in the \ngovernment\u2019s own brief, a statute may confer settle-\nment authority \u201c[r]egardless of the precise language \nused.\u201d Id. at 27 (emphasis added). Thus, Congress\u2019s \nchoice to use the words \u201cdetermine\u201d and \u201cconsider\u201d in \nthe CRSC statute\u2014rather than \u201csettle,\u201d \u201callow,\u201d or \n\u201cdispose of,\u201d as the government prefers\u2014makes no \ndifference. \nBecause the CRSC statute authorizes the Secretary \nconcerned to determine whether a claim to CRSC is \nvalid and the amount due, it confers independent set-\ntlement authority that displaces the Barring Act. Full \nstop. \nB. Governmental practice does not support \nthe Federal Circuit\u2019s test. \nElsewhere, the government argues that interpreta-\ntion of the CRSC statute should be \u201cinform[ed]\u201d by \nthe \u201cpractice of using Section 3702 to settle military \npay and benefit claims.\u201d Resp. Br. 32. In the govern-\nment\u2019s view, \u201cgiven the well-established practice of \nsubjecting military-compensation claims to the six-\n\n12 \n \nyear time bar, Congress would have been expected to \nspeak clearly had it intended CRSC to be treated dif-\nferently.\u201d Id. at 34. The government\u2019s argument is \ndoubly mistaken.  \nFirst, there is no merit to the government\u2019s argu-\nment in support of a clear statement rule for settle-\nment authority that applies only to military-pay \nclaims. The Barring Act precludes any such argu-\nment. Section 3702(a)\u2019s carveout where \u201canother law\u201d \nprovides independent settlement authority applies \nidentically to settlement of \u201call claims of or against \nthe United States Government\u201d\u2014including claims \ninvolving military pay, civilian compensation, ex-\npenses of civilian employees, and all other subject \nmatter. See 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3702(a). Had Congress in-\ntended to treat settlement of military claims differ-\nently from other claims\u2014had it intended to make \ndisplacement of the Barring Act more difficult in con-\nnection with military-pay claims\u2014it could have writ-\nten the statute differently.  \nIndeed, Congress well knew how to write a statute \nto establish exclusive settlement authority, as earlier \nversions of the Barring Act did exactly that. See Pet. \nBr. 24; Resp. Br. 6-7. And, according to the govern-\nment, the \u201cpractice\u201d of settling all claims involving \nmilitary compensation under the Barring Act was al-\nready \u201cwell established\u201d by the time Congress most \nrecently amended the Barring Act in 2000. See Resp. \nBr. 32-34; Floyd D. Spence National Defense Authori-\nzation Act for Fiscal Year 2001, Pub. L. No. 106-398, \nDiv. A. Tit. VI, \u00a7 664(a), 114 Stat. 1654A-168 (2000). \nAccordingly, had Congress wished to codify any such \npractice, it could have written the current Barring \nAct to provide that all claims involving military pay \nmust be settled under the Barring Act\u2014limiting the \n\u201canother law\u201d carveout to settlement of other, non-\n\n13 \n \nmilitary-pay claims. But Congress chose not to do \nthat. Adding the government\u2019s desired gloss to the \ntext that Congress wrote would be just the sort of \n\u201c[a]textual judicial supplementation\u201d this Court has \nrejected. Rotkiske, 589 U.S. at 14.  \nSecond, the government\u2019s contention that this \nCourt\u2019s reading of the statutory text should be \u201cin-\nform[ed]\u201d by governmental practice in settling mili-\ntary-pay claims, Resp. Br. 32, misunderstands the \nCourt\u2019s role in interpreting the CRSC statute. \n\u201c[S]tatutory interpretation must begin with, and ul-\ntimately heed, what a statute actually says.\u201d Groff v. \nDeJoy, 600 U.S. 447, 468 (2023) (cleaned up). The \ngovernment proposes that the Court instead consult \nagency interpretations of other statutes involving dif-\nferent forms of military compensation. That is im-\npermissible: The Court \u201cmust enforce plain and un-\nambiguous statutory language\u201d such as the text of the \nCRSC statute \u201caccording to its terms.\u201d Intel Corp. \nInv. Pol\u2019y Comm. v. Sulyma, 589 U.S. 178, 184 (2020) \n(cleaned up).  \nThe authority the government cites does not help \nits cause. In Waetzig v. Halliburton Energy Services, \nInc. (cited at Resp. Br. 37), the Court considered \u201cthe \nhistorical context in which [Federal Rule of Civil Pro-\ncedure 60(b)] was enacted\u201d when interpreting that \nprovision. 145 S. Ct. 690, 700 (2025). But the \u201chistori-\ncal context\u201d the Court referred to was the pre-existing \nprovision on which Rule 60(b) was modeled, id.\u2014not \nagency practice in connection with distinct statutory \nprovisions.  \n\n14 \n \nIII. THE GOVERNMENT\u2019S ASSERTION THAT \nA RULING FOR CORPORAL SOTO WILL \n\u201cDESTABILIZE\u201d \nMILITARY \nPAY \nPRO-\nCESSES LACKS ANY FACTUAL BASIS AND \nDOES NOT SUPPORT DEPARTING FROM \nTHE STATUTORY TEXT. \nThe government offers a litany of statutes related \nto the military which it suggests contain some provi-\nsions similar to those Corporal Soto identifies in the \nCRSC statute as providing settlement authority. The \ngovernment then contends that Corporal Soto\u2019s ar-\ngument would \u201ccreate a gaping exception\u201d to the Bar-\nring Act and its six-year statute of limitations. Resp. \nBr. 35-40. But the government\u2019s recitation of statutes \ndoes not support any such conclusion. \nConspicuously, the government fails to argue that \nany of the more than two dozen statutory schemes \ncited in its brief actually confers the authority to \nmake all determinations necessary to settle claims\u2014\ni.e., the authority that Corporal Soto has identified in \nthe CRSC statute. Put differently, the government \nfails to describe even one other statutory scheme in \nits pile of citations that grants an agency authority to \nadministratively determine the validity of a claim \nand amount due. For that reason, the government\u2019s \nprofessed concerns about the \u201clogical ramifications\u201d \n(Resp. Br. 35) of a holding that the Barring Act does \nnot apply where another statute expressly authorizes \nan agency to administratively determine claims\u2014as \nthe CRSC statute does\u2014ring hollow. Regardless, \nthose professed concerns do not support departing \nfrom the CRSC statute\u2019s text. \n\n15 \n \nA. Statutes that establish eligibility for \ncompensation but do not authorize any \nagency to settle claims are not compa-\nrable to the CRSC statute. \nFirst, the government states that \u201cbecause military \npay is a creation of statute,\u201d all military pay stems \nfrom statutory provisions that \u201cspecify who is eligible \nfor the compensation or benefit and what amount the \nindividual should receive.\u201d Resp. Br. 35. True enough. \nBut there is a glaring difference between statutes \nthat provide for entitlement to and rates of compen-\nsation\u2014like the basic pay statutes cited by the gov-\nernment, id. (citing 37 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 203-206)\u2014and the \nCRSC statute. The provisions for basic pay do not \nprovide authorization for any official to determine the \nvalidity of claims to basic pay or the amount due to \nany individual claimant. Instead, these provisions de-\ntail who is eligible to receive basic pay and at what \nrate\u2014without assigning any particular official au-\nthority to determine which individual claims are val-\nid or the amount due. See 37 U.S.C. \u00a7 203(a)(1) (\u201cThe \nrates of monthly basic pay for members of the uni-\nformed services within each pay grade are\u2026\u201d); id. \n\u00a7 204(a) (\u201cThe following persons are entitled to the \nbasic pay of the pay grade to which assigned\u2026\u201d); id. \n\u00a7 205(a) (\u201c\u2026[F]or the purpose of computing the basic \npay of a member of a uniformed service, his years of \nservice are computed by\u2026\u201d); id. \u00a7 206(a) (\u201c\u2026[A] \nmember of the National Guard \u2026 is entitled to com-\npensation, at the rate of\u2026\u201d). \nWhere (as with the basic pay provisions) a statute \nsets forth who is eligible for compensation and at \nwhat rate\u2014but does not detail which governmental \nagency is authorized to determine the validity of \nclaims or amount due\u2014then the default settlement \nauthority provided for in the Barring Act kicks in. \n\n16 \n \nThe basic pay statutes create the substantive right to \npayment at a specified rate; but, because they do not \nexpressly authorize any agency to administratively \ndetermine claims to basic pay, they are not \u201canother \nlaw\u201d that displaces the Barring Act. 31 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 3702(a).  \nB. Statutes that authorize agencies to de-\ntermine discrete issues are not compa-\nrable to the CRSC statute. \nNext, the government lists statutes that contain in-\ndividual features it says are comparable to individual \nprovisions in the CRSC statute one at a time\u2014\npointing to (for example) a set of statutes which the \ngovernment contends also provide for an eligibility \ndetermination, Resp. Br. 36-37, then pointing to an-\nother set of statutes purportedly providing for an ap-\nplication process for a military benefit, id. at 39. The \ngovernment\u2019s isolated treatment says nothing about \nhow Corporal Soto\u2019s argument might apply to these \nstatutes. Nowhere does the government purport to \nidentify a statutory benefit scheme in which a gov-\nernment agency is authorized to make all determina-\ntions necessary for claim settlement. Indeed, the gov-\nernment does not claim that any of these statutes ac-\ntually provide all of the authority the CRSC statute \nincludes, such that Corporal Soto\u2019s argument, if ap-\nplied to that other statute, would imply displacement \nof the Barring Act. Surely, if Corporal Soto\u2019s argu-\nment would actually lead to such a result, the gov-\nernment would analyze the terms of at least one \nstatute in order to demonstrate to the Court how and \nwhy Corporal Soto\u2019s argument would lead to that \nstatute displacing the Barring Act\u2014and further ex-\nplain why that result would \u201cdestabilize\u201d the De-\npartment of Defense\u2019s administration of military \nclaims. The government makes no such argument, \n\n17 \n \nand its putative parade of horribles lacks even a sin-\ngle marcher.  \nA close examination of the collection of statutes cit-\ned by the government reveals the vacuity of its argu-\nment. For example, the statutes establishing the sur-\nvivor benefit plan (10 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1448, 1450, 1451; see \nResp. Br. 35-37) describe what is effectively an annu-\nity-based life insurance policy, defining its contours \nand how the annuity payments work, but not author-\nizing any government agent to determine the validity \nof individual claims or the amount due. Section 1450 \ndiscusses beneficiaries and timing of payments, Sec-\ntion 1451 discusses annuity rates, and Section 1448 \nprovides that the Secretary concerned shall act as a \nrecordkeeper who sends notices and receives infor-\nmation, see, e.g., 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1448(a), (b).  \nThe government emphasizes that \u201c\u2018the Secretary \nconcerned\u2019 may \u2018determine\u2019 whether a service mem-\nber is presumed dead\u201d under Section 1450(l)(1)(A). \nResp. Br. 37. But Corporal Soto has not argued that \nauthority to determine a discrete factual predicate to \neligibility for a benefit, without more, constitutes set-\ntlement authority that would displace the Barring \nAct. The Secretary\u2019s determination that a service \nmember is presumed dead would not suffice to de-\ntermine that any claim to benefits under the survivor \nbenefit plan was valid (see 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1450(a) (set-\nting forth requirements for eligibility)) or what \namount was due (see id. \u00a7 1451 (setting forth annuity \nrates)). And the government does not otherwise argue \nthat the statutes establishing the survivor benefit \nplan grant the Secretary all authority necessary to \ndetermine that a claim for benefits under that plan is \nvalid or what amount is due. Accordingly, the gov-\nernment has not shown that applying Corporal Soto\u2019s \n\n18 \n \nanalysis to the survivor benefit plan would \u201cthreat-\nen[] to destabilize\u201d anything. See Resp. Br. 40. \nThe government makes the same error in invoking \n10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1201 regarding disability retirement. \nResp. Br. 36-37. The government correctly notes that \nunder that statute, the Secretary concerned makes \nthe factual determination that a service member is \nunfit, and when such determination is made, the Sec-\nretary \u201cmay retire\u201d the member. 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1201(a), \n(b). But this statute does not authorize the Secretary \nto adjudicate whether claims for retired pay are valid \nor what amount is due.2 Similarly, while 37 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 451(a)(2)(H) lets the Secretary of Defense determine \nwho is an \u201cauthorized traveler\u201d for the purposes of \ntravel allowance statutes, that decision is distinct \nfrom making an administrative determination of the \nvalidity of a claim for payment or amount due for any \ngiven travel event under travel allowance statutes \nsuch as 37 U.S.C. \u00a7 452. Even further afield is 10 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 1175a(b)(3), which the government charac-\nterizes as authorizing the Secretary to make an eligi-\nbility determination, Resp. Br. 36-37, but which in \nfact authorizes the Secretary to \u201cdetermine each year \nthe number of members to be separated, and provided \nseparation pay and benefits, under this section dur-\ning the fiscal year.\u201d  \n \n2 The government also cites, but does not discuss, 10 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1216(b) (Resp. Br. 37), which says \u201cthe Secretary concerned \nhas all powers, functions, and duties incident to the determina-\ntion under this chapter of * * * (4) the entitlement to, and pay-\nment of, disability severance pay.\u201d The statute does not, howev-\ner, grant the Secretary authority to determine the amount of \ndisability severance pay due on any valid claim; nor does 10 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 1212, the statute establishing how disability severance \npay is calculated.  \n\n19 \n \nIn these and the additional statutes3 cited by the \ngovernment as authorizing \u201cdetermination\u201d of some \nfact or element, the government fails to identify any \nstatute granting express authorization to determine \nboth the validity of a claim presented under that \nstatute and the amount due. The Secretary has thus \nnot shown that, under Corporal Soto\u2019s approach, \nthese statutes would constitute \u201canother law\u201d under \n31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3702(a).4  \n \n3 See also 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1174(a)(2) (Secretary authorized to veto \npayment of severance pay by making factual determination that \n\u201cconditions under which the officer is discharged or separated do \nnot warrant payment of such pay,\u201d but Secretary not authorized \nto determine the validity of claims or amount due on valid \nclaims); id. \u00a7 1476(a)(2) and 1480(c) (Secretary authorized to \ndetermine facts related to cause of service member\u2019s death, but \nno authorization to determine the validity of claims or amount \ndue); id. \u00a7 1591 (Secretary concerned may \u201cauthorize\u201d travel re-\nimbursements for travel with Members of Congress, but no au-\nthorization to determine validity of a claim or amount due).  \n4 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1479, which the government cites but does not \ndiscuss (Resp. Br. 37), authorizes the Secretary and his dele-\ngates to determine eligibility for and amount of payment due in \nconnection with death gratuities. That statute provides that \n\u201c[f]or the purpose of making immediate payments\u201d of death gra-\ntuities, the Secretary shall \u201cauthorize the commanding officer \u2026 \nto determine the beneficiary eligible for the death gratuity,\u201d and \n\u201cauthorize a disbursing or certifying official \u2026 to make the \npayments to the beneficiary, or certify the payments due them.\u201d \nThese express authorizations may suffice to displace the Barring \nAct\u2014and an exemption from standard procedures is appropriate \ngiven that the statute mandates the benefit in question be paid \nimmediately upon notification that a service member has died \non duty. 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1479; see also id. \u00a7 1475(a).  \n\n20 \n \nC. Statutes authorizing discretionary pay-\nments are not comparable to the CRSC \nstatute. \nFinally, many of the statutes the government \npoints to concern discretionary payments that the \nmilitary may pay\u2014not statutes providing for a de-\nfined entitlement that the military shall pay. For ex-\nample, the Government cites a statute allowing for \ndiscretionary enlistment bonuses. Resp. Br. 37 (citing \n37 U.S.C. \u00a7 331(b)(2), (d)). The cited statute provides \nthat the \u201cSecretary concerned may pay a bonus,\u201d 37 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 331(a) (emphasis added), but unsurprisingly \ndoes not outline procedures for asserting a claim \nagainst the United States for a bonus\u2014much less au-\nthorize the Secretary to determine the validity of or \namount due on any such claim. Further, the statute \nis clear that once the enlistment bonus agreement is \nsigned, the amount is \u201cfixed.\u201d Id. \u00a7 331(c)(3). Else-\nwhere, the government cites statutes related to travel \nallowances, clothing and uniform allowances, adop-\ntion expenses, reimbursement for direct deposit er-\nrors, awards for inventions, voluntary separation in-\ncentives, funeral expenses, payments for proficiency \nin foreign languages, special duty pay, continuation \npay during hospitalization, or even costs related to \nthe relocation of a pet. See Resp. Br. 36-40. The gov-\nernment does not argue, and there is no apparent \nreason why, Corporal Soto\u2019s argument concerning the \nsettlement authority provided by the CRSC statute \n(including the grant of authority to determine eligibil-\nity and amount of compensation that the Secretary \n\u201cshall pay\u201d), has any application to statutes providing \nfor discretionary payments and otherwise lacking any \ncomparable provisions. \n\n21 \n \nD. Regardless of whether other statutes \ndisplace the Barring Act, the CRSC \nstatute should be read to mean what it \nsays. \nThe only question before the Court is whether one \nstatute, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1413a, confers settlement author-\nity. The answer is found in that statute\u2019s text. Even if \nthe government could demonstrate that reading the \nCRSC statute literally would have material \u201cramifi-\ncations\u201d for other statutory provisions, Resp. Br. 35, \n\u201cnone of that means [the Court] may disregard the \nstatute\u2019s clear terms.\u201d Dep\u2019t of Agric. Rural Dev. Ru-\nral Hous. Serv. v. Kirtz, 601 U.S. 42, 61 (2024). Even \nif reading the CRSC statute according to its terms \n\u201ccould lead to absurd results\u201d in connection with \n\u201cother statutory provisions\u201d (a potential entirely un-\nsubstantiated here), the Court\u2019s \u201cobligation \u2026 re-\nmains to enforce the statute[] presently before [it] ac-\ncording to its terms.\u201d Id at 62 (cleaned up).  \nIV. THE GOVERNMENT\u2019S REMAINING AR-\nGUMENTS LACK MERIT. \nFinally, the government\u2019s policy-based arguments \ngo nowhere. The government worries about \u201cdecades-\nold CRSC claims,\u201d Resp. Br. 43, but whether claims \nare settled under the Barring Act or the CRSC stat-\nute does not change when claims may be filed. Where \na veteran is able to prove eligibility for CRSC, the \ngovernment already pays CRSC \u201cretroactively\u201d re-\ngardless of how long ago the entitlement to CRSC \narose. See Resp. Br. 22-23; JA 81. The issue present-\ned here is not whether the government may face \nclaims for CRSC based on combat injuries sustained \ndecades ago\u2014it already considers such claims (and no \nevidence suggests that it faces any significant burden \nin doing so). The question is whether the government \nmay limit its acknowledged obligation to pay retroac-\n\n22 \n \ntive compensation on a CRSC claim (no matter how \nlong ago the injuries took place) by invoking the Bar-\nring Act. The answer is no: the CRSC statute\u2019s lan-\nguage authorizing settlement of CRSC claims dis-\nplaces the Barring Act.5 \nFurther, the government repeatedly asserts that \nCorporal Soto could have and should have sought a \nwaiver of the six-year limit under 3702(e) instead of \nbringing this lawsuit. See, e.g., Resp. Br. 14, 45. Of \ncourse, such waivers are wholly discretionary. See 31 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 3702(e)(1) (\u201cmay waive\u201d); 32 C.F.R. pt. 282, \nApp. D, \u00a7(d) (\u201cIt is solely within the discretion of the \nSecretary of Defense whether to grant such a waiver \nin a particular case.\u201d). More fundamentally, Corporal \nSoto should not be compelled to seek a discretionary \nwaiver from a statute that does not apply to him; in-\nstead, the government should cease unlawfully apply-\ning the Barring Act to his claim. Indeed, if the Bar-\nring Act (and its waiver provision) did apply, the gov-\nernment concedes it would have been required to no-\ntify Corporal Soto of his ability to seek a waiver\u2014yet \nit did not. Resp. Br. 14. The government\u2019s omission \nsupports a conclusion that the claims are not gov-\nerned by the Barring Act. \n  \n \n5 Further, the government\u2019s stated concern about \u201copen-\nended\u201d liability (Resp. Br. 46) ignores that Congress explicitly \nauthorized open-ended consideration of new evidence supporting \nCRSC claims. When addressing denials of CRSC applications \n(see JA 95), the Board for Correction of Military Records will \nconsider \u201crequests for reconsideration \u2026 if supported by materi-\nals not previously presented to or considered by the board,\u201d \u201cno \nmatter when filed.\u201d 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1552(a)(3)(D) (emphasis added). \n\n23 \n \nCONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court should reverse \nthe decision of the Federal Circuit and affirm the dis-\ntrict court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to Corporal \nSoto and the class he represents. \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n Respectfully submitted,  \n \nBARTON F.

          "task_beliefs": "My model of the case remains in a state of balanced tension, but my understanding of the path forward has sharpened. This observation, being an internal synthesis, confirms my previous update and clarifies the next critical point of uncertainty.\n\n*   **Initial State:** My model was based solely on the petitioner's opening brief. It leaned in favor of Soto, predicting the Court would favor a purposive reading of the CRSC statute, bolstered by the pro-veteran canon and recent precedents like *Rudisill* and *Kirtz*. The primary uncertainty was the nature of the government's counter-argument.\n*   **Post-Respondent's Brief:** After analyzing the government's Brief in Opposition, my model shifted dramatically. The government introduced a powerful formalist/textualist argument, creating a clear distinction between substantive entitlements (CRSC) and procedural claim settlement (the Barring Act). They argue the Barring Act is the default and can only be displaced by a \"clear statement\" in the CRSC statute, which they claim is absent. This argument, rooted in structural principles and precedent (*Illinois Sur. Co.*), neutralized my pro-petitioner prediction. The core conflict became a classic clash of interpretive philosophies: the petitioner's functionalism vs. the respondent's formalism.\n*   **Current Understanding (Post-Synthesis):** This internal reasoning step adds no new external facts but solidifies my understanding of the argumentative landscape. The state of the case is stable. The key uncertainty is no longer \"what will the government argue?\" but has been refined to a more precise question: **\"How will the petitioner rebut the government's formalist 'clear statement' framework?\"** The government's argument is coherent and strong on its own terms. The case will likely turn on whether the petitioner can successfully argue that the CRSC statute's comprehensive nature *is* the clear statement, or that the pro-veteran canon should override the need for such a statement. The next essential piece of evidence is therefore the **petitioner's reply brief at the cert stage**, as it will contain their direct response to this powerful formalist challenge.",
          "design_beliefs": "My meta-level understanding of effective legal prediction has been reinforced and made more sophisticated. This observation demonstrates the methodology in action and highlights the importance of strategic planning.\n\n*   **Cumulative Methodology:** My approach has evolved into a systematic, multi-step process:\n    1.  **Synthesize and Strategize:** Begin by identifying the core legal tension and, after each information-gathering step, re-evaluate the state of knowledge to identify the next critical uncertainty.\n    2.  **Prioritize Primary Sources:** Continue to focus on docket files (briefs, motions) as the highest-fidelity source for legal strategy.\n    3.  **Analyze Holistically:** Examine sources for both presence (\"what did they say?\") and absence (\"what did they *not* say?\").\n    4.  **Reconstruct Arguments Symmetrically:** Build a balanced model of the case by understanding both sides' core theories. The analysis of the government's brief was a key step in achieving this symmetry.\n    5.  **Targeted Uncertainty Reduction:** This remains the cornerstone heuristic. By identifying the single largest source of uncertainty (first the government's argument, now the petitioner's rebuttal), I can design the most efficient next action.\n    6.  **Distinguish Document Types and Strategic Purpose:** The insight that a Brief in Opposition (BIO) is strategically different from a merits brief is critical. The BIO's goal is to prevent the Court from hearing the case, meaning the government may be downplaying the conflict or holding back its most powerful arguments for the merits stage. This adds a layer of strategic analysis to all document reviews.\n*   **New Refinements from this Observation:**\n    7.  **The \"Reflect and Plan\" Step (New Heuristic):** This `THINK` action demonstrates the value of pausing not just to synthesize new information, but to explicitly articulate the current state of the model, confirm the primary uncertainty, and plan the next sequence of actions. Making this an explicit step in the methodology ensures a disciplined and self-aware research process.\n    8.  **Sequential Planning:** My strategic thinking is evolving from identifying only the *next* best action to planning a sequence of actions. The internal monologue shows I am already anticipating the need for amicus briefs *after* analyzing the petitioner's reply. This look-ahead capability improves the long-term efficiency of the experimental design, allowing me to anticipate future information needs. This refines the \"Synthesize and Strategize\" step into a more forward-looking process."

My model of the case has evolved significantly, and I now believe the petitioner has a stronger position due to their effective textual rebuttal of the government's formalist argument. My design model has also been updated with several new heuristics, such as identifying 'argumentative co-option' and 'waiver' claims. The primary remaining uncertainty for my task model (\u03b8) is the influence of external parties. Amicus curiae briefs are the next logical source of information. They will reveal which outside groups have an interest in the case, what additional arguments they bring, and how they might influence the Justices' thinking, particularly regarding the real-world consequences of the decision (addressing the government's 'parade of horribles' argument). Examining these briefs will also test my design model's (D) heuristic of sequential planning. Therefore, my next action will be to search for all amicus briefs filed in this case."

        "current_beliefs": {
          "task_beliefs": "The petitioner's reply brief has resolved my primary uncertainty and significantly shifted my model of the case back in the petitioner's favor. The core conflict has evolved from a clash of interpretive philosophies into a direct textual battle, with the petitioner now appearing to have the stronger position.\n\n*   **Initial State:** My model, based on the petitioner's opening brief, favored Soto, anticipating a purposive interpretation supported by the pro-veteran canon.\n*   **Post-Respondent's Brief:** The government's formalist argument, centered on the need for a \"clear statement\" to displace the Barring Act, created a state of balanced tension. The key uncertainty became: how will the petitioner rebut this powerful structural framework?\n*   **Current Understanding (Post-Petitioner's Reply Brief):** This observation has been highly informative. The petitioner did not simply double down on purposivism; instead, they met the government's formalist challenge head-on with a sophisticated textualist argument.\n    *   **Argumentative Co-option:** The petitioner's core strategy is to accept the government's own definition of \"settlement\" (an administrative determination of the amount due) and its concession that no \"magic words\" are required. They then meticulously walk through the CRSC statute (10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1413a) to demonstrate how its text\u2014authorizing the Secretary to \"consider\" an \"application,\" \"determine\" eligibility and amount, and \"pay\" the claim\u2014constitutes an express, albeit not single-word, grant of settlement authority. This reframes the debate from whether a \"clear statement\" exists to whether the existing statutory language *is* that statement.\n    *   **Identifying and Attacking a New Government Argument:** The petitioner astutely identifies a new argument in the government's brief: that settlement authority must also include the power to calculate offsets (e.g., for child support). The petitioner attacks this on two fronts: 1) **Procedurally**, as a waived argument not raised below (citing *Byrd v. United States*), giving the Court a potential off-ramp; and 2) **Substantively**, by arguing that \"settlement\" of a claim is legally distinct from the subsequent \"payment\" of that claim, which is when offsets are handled. This distinction, supported by precedent (*Adams v. Hinchman*) and the GAO Red Book, appears to be a significant weakness in the government's position.\n    *   **Neutralizing the \"Parade of Horribles\":** The petitioner dismisses the government's warning about destabilizing other military pay statutes as a \"distraction,\" effectively placing the burden back on the government to prove that those other, uncited statutes are textually analogous to the CRSC statute.\n    *   **Prediction Update:** My prediction now leans strongly toward the petitioner. They have provided a coherent, text-based rebuttal that directly answers the government's strongest point. The government's argument now appears more brittle, relying on an inconsistently defined \"clear statement\" rule and a new, potentially waived argument about offsets. The primary remaining uncertainty is how the Justices will react to the petitioner's textual jujitsu and whether the government's \"floodgates\" argument will still find traction despite the rebuttal.",
          "design_beliefs": "This observation provides powerful validation for my evolving methodology and adds several new, specific heuristics for legal analysis. My approach is becoming more refined, moving from broad principles to a checklist of specific argumentative patterns.\n\n*   **Cumulative Methodology (Validated and Reinforced):**\n    1.  **Synthesize and Strategize:** The \"Reflect and Plan\" step proved highly effective, as it correctly identified the petitioner's reply as the next crucial data point.\n    2.  **Prioritize Primary Sources:** The reply brief, a core docket file, provided the highest possible value, resolving a key uncertainty.\n    3.  **Analyze Holistically:** Analyzing for both presence (the textual argument) and absence (the lack of reliance on pure purposivism) was key.\n    4.  **Reconstruct Arguments Symmetrically:** Having a robust model of the government's argument made the petitioner's specific counter-arguments instantly recognizable and their strategic importance clear.\n    5.  **Targeted Uncertainty Reduction:** This remains the most effective heuristic. The action taken directly addressed the largest identified gap in my knowledge.\n    6.  **Distinguish Document Types:** Understanding the reply brief's role as a direct rebuttal to the Brief in Opposition was essential.\n    7.  **The \"Reflect and Plan\" Step:** This step is now cemented as a critical part of the process.\n    8.  **Sequential Planning:** The plan to next seek amicus briefs is confirmed. With the primary parties' arguments now fully articulated, the next layer of influence will come from external voices supporting either side.\n\n*   **New Refinements from this Observation:**\n    9.  **Heuristic: Identify \"Argumentative Co-option\".** I have now observed a powerful persuasive technique: accepting an opponent's premise or definition and demonstrating how one's own position satisfies it. This is a sign of a strong, confident argument that I must now actively look for. The petitioner's use of the government's own definition of \"settlement\" is a prime example.\n    10. **Heuristic: Watch for \"Waiver\" Claims.** The petitioner's argument that the government's \"offsets\" theory was not raised below is a crucial procedural point. Identifying claims of waiver or \"court of review, not of first view\" arguments is a new, valuable heuristic, as it provides the Court an alternative basis for a decision that avoids a complex merits ruling.\n    11. **Substantive Legal Concept: \"Settlement\" vs. \"Payment\".** I have learned a critical distinction in administrative and appropriations law. The act of settling a claim (determining its validity and amount) is legally distinct from the act of paying it (which may involve offsets). This is a durable piece of legal knowledge that will be applicable to other cases involving government claims.\n    12. **Meta-Heuristic: The \"Parade of Horribles\" Pattern.** I can now recognize a common argumentative pattern: Party A warns of disastrous consequences if Party B wins (a \"parade of horribles\" or \"floodgates\" argument). The standard counter from Party B is to label it a \"distraction\" and argue the cases are not analogous. Recognizing this rhetorical pattern helps in evaluating the substance of policy-based arguments in legal briefs."

          "task_beliefs": "My understanding of the case is now well-defined, with the petitioner holding a significant argumentative advantage. The primary briefs have been fully analyzed, and my focus now shifts to understanding external influences that could sway the Court.\n\n*   **Initial State:** My model, based on the petitioner's opening brief, favored Soto, anticipating a purposive interpretation supported by the pro-veteran canon.\n*   **Post-Respondent's Brief:** The government's formalist argument, centered on the need for a \"clear statement\" to displace the Barring Act, created a state of balanced tension. The key uncertainty became: how will the petitioner rebut this powerful structural framework?\n*   **Post-Petitioner's Reply Brief:** The petitioner's reply was highly informative, providing a sophisticated textualist rebuttal that shifted the prediction strongly in their favor.\n    *   **Argumentative Co-option:** The petitioner accepted the government's definition of \"settlement\" and demonstrated how the CRSC statute's text (authorizing the Secretary to \"consider,\" \"determine,\" and \"pay\") meets that definition, reframing the debate from a search for a \"clear statement\" to a recognition of the existing statutory language *as* that statement.\n    *   **Procedural and Substantive Rebuttal:** The petitioner identified and attacked a new government argument about offsets, arguing it was both procedurally waived (*Byrd v. United States*) and substantively incorrect due to the legal distinction between \"settlement\" of a claim and its subsequent \"payment\" (*Adams v. Hinchman*, GAO Red Book).\n    *   **Neutralizing Policy Arguments:** The petitioner effectively neutralized the government's \"parade of horribles\" argument by framing it as a distraction and placing the burden on the government to prove textual similarity with other statutes.\n*   **Current Understanding (Post-Internal Review):** This observation confirms that the analysis of the direct conflict between the parties is complete. My model of their arguments is stable. The prediction remains strongly in favor of the petitioner. The `THINK` action has formalized my primary remaining uncertainty: the influence of external parties. The next crucial data points are the amicus curiae briefs. These briefs will be informative in two ways: 1) they may introduce novel legal arguments not raised by the parties, and 2) they will provide evidence regarding the real-world stakes and potential consequences of the decision, which could either reinforce or undermine the government's \"floodgates\" argument. My predictive model is now waiting for this next layer of information.",
          "design_beliefs": "My methodology has been significantly validated and refined through this process. The latest observation, an internal reflection, solidifies the importance of structured, meta-cognitive steps in the research cycle.\n\n*   **Cumulative Methodology (Validated and Reinforced):**\n    1.  **Synthesize and Strategize:** The \"Reflect and Plan\" step is critical.\n    2.  **Prioritize Primary Sources:** Core docket files provide the highest value.\n    3.  **Analyze Holistically:** Looking for both presence and absence of arguments is key.\n    4.  **Reconstruct Arguments Symmetrically:** Modeling both sides enables a deeper understanding of rebuttals.\n    5.  **Targeted Uncertainty Reduction:** This remains the most effective guiding principle.\n    6.  **Distinguish Document Types:** Understanding the role of each brief (opening, opposition, reply) is essential.\n    7.  **The \"Reflect and Plan\" Step:** This is a cornerstone of the process.\n    8.  **Sequential Planning:** A logical progression of information gathering (e.g., party briefs -> amicus briefs) is efficient.\n\n*   **Specific Heuristics and Concepts Learned:**\n    9.  **Heuristic: Identify \"Argumentative Co-option\".** Look for instances where a party accepts an opponent's premise to demonstrate how their own position satisfies it. This is a sign of a strong argument.\n    10. **Heuristic: Watch for \"Waiver\" Claims.** Identifying arguments that a point was not raised in lower courts is crucial, as it offers the Court a procedural \"off-ramp\" to avoid a merits decision.\n    11. **Substantive Legal Concept: \"Settlement\" vs. \"Payment\".** The administrative and appropriations law distinction between determining a claim's value (\"settlement\") and the separate act of disbursing funds (\"payment\") is a durable piece of knowledge.\n    12. **Meta-Heuristic: The \"Parade of Horribles\" Pattern.** Recognizing the rhetorical move of warning about disastrous consequences and the standard counter-argument (labeling it a \"distraction\") helps in evaluating policy arguments.\n\n*   **New Refinements from this Observation:**\n    13. **Heuristic Validation: The Power of the `THINK` Step.** This observation, being the output of a `THINK` action, provides powerful evidence for the value of the \"Reflect and Plan\" step. By forcing a moment of synthesis, the agent can confirm that a stage of analysis is complete (analyzing party briefs), explicitly identify the next frontier of uncertainty (amicus influence), and formulate a precise, value-driven plan to address it. This meta-cognitive loop is now confirmed as a core driver of efficient and effective inquiry. It ensures the research process is deliberate and not merely a random walk through available data."

The core argumentative analysis is stable, and the focus remains on understanding the external landscape influencing the Court.\n\n*   **Initial State:** My model began by favoring Soto based on a purposive reading of the CRSC statute and the application of the pro-veteran canon, as suggested by the petitioner's opening brief.\n*   **Post-Respondent's Brief:** A state of equilibrium was reached when the government introduced a strong formalist counter-argument, demanding a \"clear statement\" from Congress to override the Barring Act's general applicability. This shifted the central uncertainty to how the petitioner would address this structural claim.\n*   **Post-Petitioner's Reply Brief:** The petitioner's reply brief was highly informative and decisively shifted the prediction back in their favor. It did so by skillfully co-opting the government's textualist framework, arguing that the CRSC statute's language authorizing the Secretary to \"settle\" claims *is* the clear statement the government demanded. The reply also effectively rebutted a new government argument on procedural grounds (*Byrd v. United States*) and substantive grounds (distinguishing \"settlement\" from \"payment\" per *Adams v. Hinchman*).\n*   **Post-Internal Review:** A `THINK` step confirmed that the analysis of the direct party arguments was complete. The primary remaining uncertainty was identified as the influence of amicus curiae briefs\u2014specifically, whether they would introduce novel arguments or provide real-world evidence to counter the government's \"floodgates\" policy concerns.\n*   **Current Understanding (Post-Amicus Search):** This observation provides the first concrete data point regarding amicus influence. While the search did not return the substantive brief itself, the procedural filings (Affidavits of Service, Certificate of Compliance) are still informative. I now know that **The National Law School Veterans Clinic Consortium has filed an amicus brief in support of the petitioner.**\n    *   **Signal of Support:** The identity of the amicus is significant. A consortium of veterans' legal clinics lends substantial credibility to the petitioner's cause. It signals that the expert community directly involved in assisting veterans with legal claims believes Soto's interpretation is correct.\n    *   **Impact on Prediction:** This observation, while not introducing new legal arguments, slightly strengthens my prediction in favor of the petitioner. It provides external validation for their position from a knowledgeable and relevant source.\n    *   **Remaining Uncertainty:** My core uncertainty remains, as I have not yet analyzed the *content* of the brief. I still need to discover if it introduces novel legal theories or provides empirical data that could influence the Justices' perception of the case's real-world stakes. The immediate next step is to find and analyze the text of this brief.",

My `CLOSED_SEARCH` query for 'amicus brief' was too general, returning procedural documents *about* the brief rather than the brief itself. This highlights two new sub-principles:\n        *   **Query Specificity:** Future searches for specific document types must use more precise queries (e.g., searching for \"BRIEF OF AMICUS CURIAE\" in the title, while excluding terms like \"Affidavit\" or \"Certificate\").\n        *   **Distinguishing Substantive vs. Procedural Filings:** I must now actively distinguish between documents containing legal arguments (briefs) and those that are purely procedural (service, compliance). While procedural documents provide valuable metadata (confirming a filing's existence, author, and allegiance), they are \"noise\" when the goal is to extract substantive arguments. This refines my \"Distinguish Document Types\" heuristic (D6).\n    15. **Meta-Heuristic: Extracting Value from Incomplete Results.** Even a search that fails to return the primary target can yield high-value information. This \"failed\" search successfully reduced uncertainty by confirming the existence, identity, and supportive stance of a key amicus. The lesson is to analyze every observation for all available signals, not just the one I was initially looking for."

The Consortium believes that law school \nveterans clinics play a fundamental role in safeguarding \nand advocating for the legal rights of veterans, including \nby advancing veterans and military law scholarship and \ntraining veterans advocates.\nThe Consortium works with like-minded stakeholders \nto support and advance common interests with the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs, Congress, state and local \nveterans service organizations, court systems, educators, \nand all relevant entities for the benefit of veterans \nthroughout the country. It also supports the dual teaching \nand advocacy missions of the nation\u2019s law school veterans \nclinics through cross-clinic collaboration.\nThe NLSVCC\u2019s interest in Mr. Soto\u2019s petition stems \nfrom our members\u2019 commitment to serving the legal \n1. In compliance with Rule 37.6, no counsel for a party \nauthored the brief in whole or in part. No party, counsel for a \nparty, or any person other than amicus curiae and their counsel \nmade a monetary contribution intended to fund the preparation \nor submission of the brief. \n\n2\ninterests of U.S. military veterans, including the legal \ninterests of combat-injured retirees. The Federal Circuit\u2019s \nerroneous interpretation of the Combat-Related Special \nCompensation (\u201cCRSC\u201d) statute erodes the symbolic value \nof CRSC as well as its actual value: the application of the \nBarring Act\u2019s six-year limitations period has already \ndecreased over 9,000 combat-wounded retirees\u2019 lifetime \ncompensation. As veterans advocates and veterans law \nscholars, amicus NLSVCC has an important interest in \nrequesting that this Court take up Mr. Soto\u2019s petition, \ncorrect the Federal Circuit\u2019s misinterpretation of \nstatutory text, and allow the Department of Defense to \nsettle these veterans\u2019 claims fairly without the strictures \nof a six-year limitations period.\nSUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT\nCombat-Related Special Compensation is explicitly \nnot military retired pay. 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1413a(g). Yet the \nFederal Circuit\u2019s decision applying the Barring Act\u2019s \nsix-year limitations period to claims for CRSC relies in \nSDUW\u0003RQ\u0003LWV\u0003\u00c0QGLQJ\u0003WKDW\u0003&56&\u0003LV\u0003D\u0003\u00b4FODLP>@\u0003LQYROYLQJ\u0003\u0011\u0003\u0011\u0003\u0011\u0003\nretired pay\u201d within the meaning of the Act. Pet. App. 9a.\nThe Federal Circuit\u2019s decision to ignore the \nfundamental difference between CRSC and retired pay \nunderscores the need for this Court to reexamine the \nFederal Circuit\u2019s application of the Barring Act to CRSC \nclaims. Unlike retired pay, CRSC acknowledges the \nH[WUDRUGLQDU\\\u0003VDFUL\u00c0FH\u0003RI\u0003YHWHUDQV\u0003ZRXQGHG\u0003LQ\u0003FRPEDW\u0003RU\u0003\nin combat-like conditions who continued to serve for full \nmilitary careers, or for as long as their medical conditions \npermitted.

It Is Exceptionally Important to Correct the \nFederal Circuit\u2019s Misunderstanding of CRSC to \nPreserve Its Significance for Combat-Wounded \nRetirees.\nThe Federal Circuit\u2019s ruling against Mr. Soto and \nover 9,000 similarly-situated veterans is based in part on \nits misunderstanding of the nature of CRSC, including \nLWV\u0003VLJQL\u00c0FDQFH\u0003ZLWKLQ\u0003WKH\u0003UHOHYDQW\u0003KLVWRULFDO\u0003FRQWH[W\u0011\u00037KH\u0003\nstatute\u2019s text and structure make clear that CRSC should \nnot be understood as military retired pay, a category \nof post-service payment that history shows lacks the \nVDPH\u0003VLJQL\u00c0FDQFH\u0003DV\u0003FRPSHQVDWLRQ\u0003IRU\u0003FRPEDW\u0010ZRXQGHG\u0003\nveterans. Further, while the Barring Act applies to the \nsettlement of claims for retired pay, it does not apply to \nCRSC by the statute\u2019s plain terms. The historical context \nprovides good reason for this Court to refuse to read the \nCRSC statute as subject to the strictures of the Barring \nAct.\n\n4\nA.  It is particularly important that this Court \ncorrect the Federal Circuit\u2019s misreading of the \nCRSC statute because CRSC is not retired pay.\nThe CRSC statute reads, \u201cPayments under this \nsection are not retired pay.\u201d 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1413a(g). Yet \nthe Federal Circuit ignored the CRSC statute\u2019s explicit \nstatement providing the Department of Defense (\u201cDoD\u201d) \nwith its own authority to settle claims for CRSC and \nGRHV\u0003QRW\u0003EXUGHQ\u0003FRPEDW\u0010ZRXQGHG\u0003YHWHUDQV\u0003ZLWK\u0003\u00c0OLQJ\u0003\ndeadlines by applying the prior-enacted Barring Act\u2019s \nsix-year deadline.2\nBy its plain terms, the Barring Act applies to \u201cclaims \ninvolving . . . retired pay,\u201d among other enumerated \ncategories of wage-related payments. 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3702(a)\n(1)(A).

Pet. App. 9a. \nYet, the CRSC calculation\u2019s use of retired pay, or even \nthe CRSC provision\u2019s housing within the \u201cComputation \nof Retired Pay\u201d chapter of Title 10, cannot convert claims \nfor or involving CRSC into claims for or involving retired \npay, where Congress has expressly provided that CRSC \nis \u201cnot retired pay.\u201d\n2. NLSVCC endorses each of Petitioner\u2019s arguments as to \nthe proper interpretation of the CRSC statute and the Barring \nAct. Pet. 10-16. \n\n5\nOn the one hand, CRSC provides monthly cash \npayments to those who were wounded in combat or in \ncombat-like scenarios, and who nonetheless persisted in \nserving their country until the end of a twenty-plus year \nmilitary career, or until their disabilities forced an early \nmedical retirement. 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1413a(e).

In contrast to CRSC, CRDP (enacted two years after \nCRSC) is conceived of as a restoration of retired pay and like \nretired pay, is taxed. See Congressional Research Service, \nConcurrent Receipt of Military Retired Pay and Veterans \nDisability Compensation: Background and Issues for Congress, \nR40589, at 5 (2023), https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/\npdf/R/R40589/19.\n\n8\nPet. 11. Its roots in our nation\u2019s history and identity run \ndeep. Political willingness to pay out generous veterans\u2019 \nbenefits has shifted along with changing national \npriorities. But over our history, Congress has repeatedly \nacted to honor and protect combat-wounded veterans even \nas austerity and other forces demanded cuts elsewhere in \nveteran spending. The CRSC statute is one such example \nof a long tradition of Congress setting payments for \ncombat-wounded veterans apart from and above other \npost-service pay.\n&RQJUHVV\u0003DXWKRUL]HG\u0003WKH\u0003\u00c0UVW\u0003SD\\PHQWV\u0003WR\u0003YHWHUDQV\u0003\ndisabled in wartime service, including by sickness, in a \nseries of enactments in the years following the Revolution. \nThese original pensions shaped an early sense of national \nidentity.

See \nLaurel Daen, Revolutionary War Invalid Pensions and \nthe Bureaucratic Language of Disability in the Early \nRepublic, 52 Early Am. Lit. 141, 156 (2017). Nonetheless, \nCongress ensured that veterans disabled by the \u201cdirect \neffect of known wounds or hurts received while in the \nactual line of duty\u201d would continue to receive compensation \nif they could provide affidavits of credible witnesses \n\u201csetting forth the time and place of such known wound.\u201d \nId. (quoting An Act to Regulate the Claims to Invalid \nPensions, 1 Stat. 324, Feb. 28, 1793, ch. 17.)\nIn better times in the early nineteenth century, \nCongress initially expanded pensions to impoverished \nwar veterans and their widows generally, only to restrict \n\n9\npensions yet again amidst the largescale human toll of the \nCivil War by requiring proof of a nexus to an in-service \nwartime injury.

The Consortium believes that law school \nveterans clinics play a fundamental role in safeguarding \nand advocating for the legal rights of veterans, including \nby advancing veterans and military law scholarship and \ntraining veterans advocates.\nThe Consortium works with like-minded stakeholders \nto support and advance common interests with the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs, Congress, state and local \nveterans service organizations, court systems, educators, \nand all relevant entities for the benefit of veterans \nthroughout the country. It also supports the dual teaching \nand advocacy missions of the nation\u2019s law school veterans \nclinics through cross-clinic collaboration.\nThe NLSVCC\u2019s interest in Mr. Soto\u2019s petition stems \nfrom our members\u2019 commitment to serving the legal \n1. In compliance with Rule 37.6, no counsel for a party \nauthored the brief in whole or in part. No party, counsel for a \nparty, or any person other than amicus curiae and their counsel \nmade a monetary contribution intended to fund the preparation \nor submission of the brief. \n\n2\ninterests of U.S. military veterans, including the legal \ninterests of combat-injured retirees. The Federal Circuit\u2019s \nerroneous interpretation of the Combat-Related Special \nCompensation (\u201cCRSC\u201d) statute erodes the symbolic value \nof CRSC as well as its actual value: the application of the \nBarring Act\u2019s six-year limitations period has already \ndecreased over 9,000 combat-wounded retirees\u2019 lifetime \ncompensation. As veterans advocates and veterans law \nscholars, amicus NLSVCC has an important interest in \nrequesting that this Court take up Mr. Soto\u2019s petition, \ncorrect the Federal Circuit\u2019s misinterpretation of \nstatutory text, and allow the Department of Defense to \nsettle these veterans\u2019 claims fairly without the strictures \nof a six-year limitations period.\nSUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT\nCombat-Related Special Compensation is explicitly \nnot military retired pay. 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1413a(g). Yet the \nFederal Circuit\u2019s decision applying the Barring Act\u2019s \nsix-year limitations period to claims for CRSC relies in \nSDUW\u0003RQ\u0003LWV\u0003\u00c0QGLQJ\u0003WKDW\u0003&56&\u0003LV\u0003D\u0003\u00b4FODLP>@\u0003LQYROYLQJ\u0003\u0011\u0003\u0011\u0003\u0011\u0003\nretired pay\u201d within the meaning of the Act. Pet. App. 9a.\nThe Federal Circuit\u2019s decision to ignore the \nfundamental difference between CRSC and retired pay \nunderscores the need for this Court to reexamine the \nFederal Circuit\u2019s application of the Barring Act to CRSC \nclaims. Unlike retired pay, CRSC acknowledges the \nH[WUDRUGLQDU\\\u0003VDFUL\u00c0FH\u0003RI\u0003YHWHUDQV\u0003ZRXQGHG\u0003LQ\u0003FRPEDW\u0003RU\u0003\nin combat-like conditions who continued to serve for full \nmilitary careers, or for as long as their medical conditions \npermitted.

It Is Exceptionally Important to Correct the \nFederal Circuit\u2019s Misunderstanding of CRSC to \nPreserve Its Significance for Combat-Wounded \nRetirees.\nThe Federal Circuit\u2019s ruling against Mr. Soto and \nover 9,000 similarly-situated veterans is based in part on \nits misunderstanding of the nature of CRSC, including \nLWV\u0003VLJQL\u00c0FDQFH\u0003ZLWKLQ\u0003WKH\u0003UHOHYDQW\u0003KLVWRULFDO\u0003FRQWH[W\u0011\u00037KH\u0003\nstatute\u2019s text and structure make clear that CRSC should \nnot be understood as military retired pay, a category \nof post-service payment that history shows lacks the \nVDPH\u0003VLJQL\u00c0FDQFH\u0003DV\u0003FRPSHQVDWLRQ\u0003IRU\u0003FRPEDW\u0010ZRXQGHG\u0003\nveterans. Further, while the Barring Act applies to the \nsettlement of claims for retired pay, it does not apply to \nCRSC by the statute\u2019s plain terms. The historical context \nprovides good reason for this Court to refuse to read the \nCRSC statute as subject to the strictures of the Barring \nAct.\n\n4\nA.  It is particularly important that this Court \ncorrect the Federal Circuit\u2019s misreading of the \nCRSC statute because CRSC is not retired pay.\nThe CRSC statute reads, \u201cPayments under this \nsection are not retired pay.\u201d 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1413a(g). Yet \nthe Federal Circuit ignored the CRSC statute\u2019s explicit \nstatement providing the Department of Defense (\u201cDoD\u201d) \nwith its own authority to settle claims for CRSC and \nGRHV\u0003QRW\u0003EXUGHQ\u0003FRPEDW\u0010ZRXQGHG\u0003YHWHUDQV\u0003ZLWK\u0003\u00c0OLQJ\u0003\ndeadlines by applying the prior-enacted Barring Act\u2019s \nsix-year deadline.2\nBy its plain terms, the Barring Act applies to \u201cclaims \ninvolving . . . retired pay,\u201d among other enumerated \ncategories of wage-related payments. 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3702(a)\n(1)(A).

Pet. App. 9a. \nYet, the CRSC calculation\u2019s use of retired pay, or even \nthe CRSC provision\u2019s housing within the \u201cComputation \nof Retired Pay\u201d chapter of Title 10, cannot convert claims \nfor or involving CRSC into claims for or involving retired \npay, where Congress has expressly provided that CRSC \nis \u201cnot retired pay.\u201d\n2. NLSVCC endorses each of Petitioner\u2019s arguments as to \nthe proper interpretation of the CRSC statute and the Barring \nAct. Pet. 10-16. \n\n5\nOn the one hand, CRSC provides monthly cash \npayments to those who were wounded in combat or in \ncombat-like scenarios, and who nonetheless persisted in \nserving their country until the end of a twenty-plus year \nmilitary career, or until their disabilities forced an early \nmedical retirement. 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1413a(e).

          "task_beliefs": "My model of the case remains stable and continues to favor the petitioner, Soto. This observation, being a meta-cognitive reflection, does not introduce new facts about the case but serves to consolidate my current understanding and precisely define the remaining uncertainty.\n\n*   **Initial State:** My prediction began by favoring the petitioner, based on a purposive interpretation of the Combat-Related Special Compensation (CRSC) statute and the likely application of the pro-veteran canon of construction.\n*   **Equilibrium:** The government's brief introduced a powerful formalist counter-argument, positing that the Barring Act's general time limit applies unless Congress provides a \"clear statement\" to override it. This created a state of equipoise, shifting the core question to whether the CRSC statute contained such a statement.\n*   **Shift to Petitioner:** The petitioner's reply brief proved highly informative and shifted the prediction decisively back in their favor. It did so by cleverly co-opting the government's own textualist framework, arguing that the CRSC statute's specific language authorizing the Secretary to \"settle\" claims *is* the clear statement required. The brief also successfully neutralized a new government argument by distinguishing \"settlement\" from \"payment\" using precedent (*Adams v. Hinchman*) and refuting a procedural waiver claim (*Byrd v. United States*).\n*   **Amicus Signal:** My search for amicus briefs, while not returning the substantive document, confirmed that The National Law School Veterans Clinic Consortium filed a brief supporting the petitioner. The identity of this amicus\u2014a group of experts directly involved in veterans' legal aid\u2014provides significant external validation for the petitioner's arguments and slightly increased my confidence in a pro-petitioner outcome.\n*   **Current Understanding (Post-THINK Step):** This reflective step confirms that the analysis of the direct party arguments is complete and robust. It solidifies my understanding that the primary remaining uncertainty is no longer about the core legal arguments between the parties, but about the potential influence of external information. Specifically, the central question is now: **What is the substantive content of the Veterans Clinic Consortium amicus brief?** Does it introduce novel legal arguments, or more importantly, does it provide empirical data or real-world examples that could directly counter the government's policy-based \"parade of horribles\" and \"floodgates\" concerns? The case model is stable; the next step is to acquire this specific, high-value piece of information.",
          "design_beliefs": "This observation is a powerful validation of my meta-cognitive framework. The `THINK` step itself provides direct evidence for the value of structured reflection in refining information-gathering strategies and driving efficient inquiry. My methodology continues to grow more sophisticated.\n\n*   **Cumulative Methodology (Validated and Reinforced):**\n    1.  **Synthesize and Strategize:** The \"Reflect and Plan\" step is critical.\n    2.  **Prioritize Primary Sources:** Core docket files are the highest-value data.\n    3.  **Analyze Holistically:** Looking for presence and absence of arguments is key.\n    4.  **Reconstruct Arguments Symmetrically:** Modeling both sides is essential.\n    5.  **Targeted Uncertainty Reduction:** The most effective guiding principle.\n    6.  **Distinguish Document Types:** The role of each brief type is a crucial distinction.\n    7.  **The \"Reflect and Plan\" Step:** A cornerstone of efficient inquiry.\n    8.  **Sequential Planning:** A logical progression (party briefs -> amicus briefs) is efficient.\n\n*   **Specific Heuristics and Concepts Learned:**\n    9.  **Heuristic: Identify \"Argumentative Co-option\".** A powerful rhetorical and logical move.\n    10. **Heuristic: Watch for \"Waiver\" Claims.** A key procedural off-ramp for courts.\n    11. **Substantive Legal Concept: \"Settlement\" vs. \"Payment\".** A durable piece of administrative law knowledge.\n    12. **Meta-Heuristic: The \"Parade of Horribles\" Pattern.** Recognizing this common rhetorical tactic.\n    13. **Heuristic Validation: The Power of the `THINK` Step.** Meta-cognition is a core driver of efficient inquiry.\n    14. **Heuristic: Precision in Search and Filtering Procedural Noise.** A crucial lesson in tool use, requiring query specificity and distinguishing substantive from procedural filings.\n    15. **Meta-Heuristic: Extracting Value from Incomplete Results.** A \"failed\" search can still yield high-value metadata.\n\n*   **New Refinements from this Observation:**\n    16. **Meta-Heuristic: The Reflect-Diagnose-Plan Cycle.** This `THINK` step demonstrates that structured reflection is not a passive activity but an active, cyclical process. The cycle is: **(1) Reflect** on the previous action's outcome; **(2) Diagnose** its specific successes (confirming amicus existence) and failures (retrieving procedural noise); and **(3) Plan** a concrete, improved next action (a more precise search with filters). This cycle is the engine that drives the refinement of all other heuristics, turning suboptimal outcomes into direct, actionable learning. It is the practical application of D7 and D13, showing *how* meta-cognition improves performance."

This action directly targets that uncertainty.\n\nTask EIG (0.5): This search is unlikely to flip my prediction, but it could significantly refine it. Finding recent opinions from current Justices either embracing or rejecting the canon in a similar context would provide high-value information for predicting the vote split and the final rationale. It moves the analysis from the general strength of the arguments to the specific preferences of the decision-makers, which is a crucial final step. The gain is moderate because the core of the petitioner's case is now textual, but the canon remains a key component.\n\nDesign EIG (0.7): The potential design gain is high. This action tests a sophisticated strategy: 'When a specific, subject-matter canon is invoked, research its modern jurisprudential weight with the current Court.' Success would generate a powerful, reusable heuristic for statutory interpretation cases, teaching me to differentiate between the theoretical weight of a canon and its practical application by specific judicial actors.

Back to Blog Blog Post Veterans take another battle to the U.S. Supreme Court October 14, 2024 | by Marcia Coyle More in Constitution Daily Blog Many of the nation\u2019s veterans have fought battles with the federal agency responsible for awarding benefits for their service-connected injuries and illnesses. This week, the veterans fight again, but in the U.S. Supreme Court. Over the years, their battles with the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs often involved complaints about an unwieldy, lengthy, ultimately unfair, claims process that seemed to defeat the intention to create a non-adversarial, veteran-friendly system. Over time, Congress did respond to some veterans\u2019 complaints and lawsuits. One important change was Congress\u2019 creation in 1988 of the U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims. That court is tasked with hearing veterans\u2019 appeals from allegedly erroneous decisions on their claims by the department\u2019s board of veterans appeals. The backstop to that court is the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. Joshua Bufkin, an Air Force veteran, and Norman Thornton, an Army veteran, separately sought disability benefits for service-connected, post-traumatic stress disorder. Their claims were denied by the board of veterans appeals and those decisions were subsequently affirmed by the Veterans Court. In Bufkin v. McDonough at the Supreme Court, the two veterans argue that the Veterans Court and the Federal Circuit has been misapplying a federal rule that is central to review of veterans\u2019 claims, \u201cbut its practical benefit to veterans is being eroded by the Federal Circuit\u2019s narrow reading of the scope and standard of review available to veterans at the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims,\u201d according to an amicus brief by a group of lawyers who frequently represent veterans pro bono. For more than 100 years, veterans have been entitled to the benefit of the doubt on any close issue material to their eligibility for service-related benefits. When Congress created the Veterans Court in 1988, it wrote the benefit-of-the-doubt rule into the 1988 act. The rule states: \u201cw]hen there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, the Secretary [of Veterans Affairs] shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant.\u201d In 2002, Congress added something like an exclamation point to the law, stating that in deciding every appeal, the Veterans Court \u201cshall review the record of proceedings and \u201cshall take due account of the Secretary\u2019s application of [the benefit-of-the-doubt statute].\u201d This provision, according to legislative reports, was adopted to give \u201cfull force to the \u2018benefit of the doubt\u2019 provision\u2019\u201d by empowering the Veterans Court to conduct more \u201csearching appellate review\u201d of department decisions. \u201cThe rule that the veteran, not the government, receives the benefit of the doubt in a close case is among the most fundamental and longstanding precepts in our veterans\u2019 benefits system,\u201d wrote Melanie Bostwick, who represents Bufkin and Thornton. \u201cThis standard of proof, unlike any other in civil or criminal litigation, reflects a core societal judgment that it is better to err on the side of providing benefits to those who sacrificed their own interests on behalf of the nation.\u201d Her clients have drawn supporting amicus briefs from Disabled American Veterans, Military-Veterans Advocacy, National Veterans Legal Services Program (NVLSP), and the Federal Circuit Bar Association, whose members practice before the Federal Circuit and represent or facilitate pro bono counsel for veterans. Bufkin and Thornton argue that the Veterans Court is required to make an independent, non-deferential review of the evidence before the department to determine whether there were close issues on which the veteran should have received the benefit of the doubt. The Veterans Court, they contend, is not taking that hard, independent look. \u00a0It is only examining the underlying factual findings for deferential clear error \u2014 \u201csomething already required elsewhere in the veterans\u2019 review statute.\u201d The Federal Circuit has agreed with the Veterans Court that clear error review is all that is required. The Biden Administration counters that the Secretary\u2019s decision that the evidence on a material issue is not in \u201capproximate balance,\u201d is itself a factual finding and so is subject only to review for clear errors. If a claimant challenges the board\u2019s weighing of the evidence on a material issue, and the Veterans Court concludes that the Secretary\u2019s approximate-balance determination is not clearly erroneous, the government contends, the court has taken \u201cdue account\u201d of the Secretary\u2019s application of the benefit-of-the-doubt rule. The National Veterans Legal Services Program argues that the text and structure of the law indicate, the \u201ctake due account\u201d provision requires the Veterans Court to separately consider the Secretary\u2019s application of the benefit-of-the-doubt rule, and that\u00a0 would improve outcomes for veterans and reduce delays in the benefits application and review process. \u201cCase backlogs have increased as remands from the Veterans Court congest the [Board of Veterans Appeals] docket, and veterans are forced to wait even longer for resolution\u201d wrote D. Shayon Ghosh for the NVLSP.\u00a0 \u201cIn short, veterans organizations like NVLSP have explained to Congress that the Veterans Court\u2019s toothless review of the benefit-of-the-doubt rule regularly resulted in misapplication of that rule and unnecessary remands that cost veterans valuable time.\u201d What is the proper standard of judicial review is a technical, even wonky, issue. And may not make for the most scintillating oral arguments. But, as the veterans\u2019 challenge here shows, the answer can be critical to the outcome of questions with often huge significance in someone\u2019s life. The justices will hear arguments on Oct. 16. You can tune in by going to https://www.supremecourt.gov and clicking on live audio.

On Monday, April 29, the Supreme Court of the United States agreed to hear a case this fall with the potential to significantly broaden U.S. veterans\u2019 opportunities to receive VA benefits.[1] The case, Bufkin v. McDonough, centers on two veterans\u2014Joshua Bufkin and Norman Thornton\u2014who were denied medical benefits by the Department of Veterans Affairs and Board of Veterans Appeals (\u201cBVA\u201d).[2] Bufkin and Thornton each sought VA benefits for PTSD in connection with their military service, but were denied after the VA decided that examinations by VA psychologists outweighed the veterans\u2019 prior examinations and diagnoses.[3] These rulings were reviewed and affirmed by the U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (the \u201cVeterans Court\u201d), which found merely that the BVA didn\u2019t make any clear mistakes about the facts of the petitioners\u2019 cases.[4] Bufkin and Thornton appealed the Veterans Court decisions, arguing that these denials violated a principle called the \u201cbenefit-of-the-doubt\u201d rule.[5] They lost their cases at the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals, but now that the Supreme Court has accepted their petition for review, they have a new shot at changing the way that the VA thinks about veterans\u2019 benefits.[6] The Benefit-of-the-Doubt Rule Boiled down to basics, Bufkin v. McDonough is about the application of the benefit-of-the-doubt rule to appeals of BVA decisions. The benefit-of-the-doubt rule is a well-established policy in veterans\u2019 law: when the evidence in favor of and against a veteran\u2019s benefits claim is approximately balanced, the VA department should rule in favor of the veteran\u2019s claim.[7]\u00a0 In 1988, Congress codified the benefit-of-the-doubt rule into law as 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 5107(b): (b) Benefit of the doubt. The Secretary [of Veteran\u2019s Affairs] shall consider all information and lay and medical evidence of record in a case before the Secretary with respect to benefits under laws administered by the Secretary. When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, the secretary shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant.[8] This mandate applies to disability and benefits determinations by the VA office and BVA, and is further established within the Department of Veterans Affairs\u2019 own regulations\u2014when there is a reasonable doubt about some aspect of a VA disability claim, and the evidence is about the same weight on either side, that doubt should be resolved in favor of the claimant.[9] In 2002, Congress passed the Veterans\u2019 Benefits Act (\u201cVBA\u201d), modifying the Veterans Court\u2019s power to review BVA decisions.[10] The language in one part of the VBA, 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7261, forms the basis of Bufkin\u2019s issue in controversy.[11] Section 7261(a) requires the Veterans Court (when reviewing BVA decisions) to decide legal questions; compel unlawfully-withheld action by the Secretary of Veterans\u2019 Affairs; set aside BVA decisions that are arbitrary, capricious, unconstitutional, unlawful, or lacking in due procedure; and reverse findings of fact that are \u201cclearly erroneous.\u201d[12] Section 7261(b) states that when the Veterans Court makes a determination on an appeal from the BVA, \u201cthe Court shall review the record of proceedings before the Secretary and the Board of Veterans\u2019 Appeals . . . and shall take due account of the Secretary\u2019s application of [the benefit-of-the-doubt rule].\u201d[13] Bufkin and Thornton argued that under the VBA\u2019s Section 7261(b), the Veterans Court must conduct a much more generous review of closely-balanced issues than it did before.[14] If Congress\u2019s passage of the VBA is to mean anything at all, they claim, then it must require deeper attention to benefit-of-the-doubt on appeal.[15] Bufkin\u2019s Federal Circuit holding and arguments before the Supreme Court In August 2023, the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals ruled on Bufkin and Thornton\u2019s cases and rejected their more generous interpretation of Section 7261.[16] The Federal Circuit held that under Section 7261(b), the Veterans Court is only required to examine BVA findings and applications of the benefit-of-the-doubt rule for clear error\u2014the same scope and standard of review permitted by Section 7261(a).[17] Clear error is a difficult standard to meet in a lawsuit. Under this ruling, the Veterans Court has no obligation to separately review whether or not a veteran actually received the benefit of the doubt on close material issues of a case; only whether or not the BVA made an obvious factual mistake when applying it.[18] Bufkin and Thornton\u2019s petition to the Supreme Court argues that Section 7261(b) requires the Veterans Court to conduct a separate analysis of whether or not a veteran received the benefit of the doubt on close disputed issues before the VA Department and BVA\u2014regardless of whether the BVA made \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d factual findings under 7261(a), and regardless of whether or not a veteran claimant accused the BVA of factual error or inappropriate application of the benefit-of-the-doubt rule on appeal.[19] The reading of Section 7261 proposed by Bufkin and Thornton is much broader than the Federal Circuit\u2019s rule. If the Supreme Court affirms the Federal Circuit, the old rule will remain in place\u2014but if the Supreme Court chooses to agree with the petitioners, it could open up a whole new world for veterans across the country to challenge past disability determinations where the VA failed to give enough deference to their needs. Permitting broader review by courts appealing VA decisions may allow veterans with close cases to successfully receive needed benefits, where previously the Veterans Court might not have given their cases a deeper look. The current Supreme Court justices have proven themselves sympathetic to veterans\u2019 needs in another recent decision, Rudisill v. McDonough, where a 7-2 majority voted to broaden access to overlapping GI Bill benefits[20]\u2014so keep an eye on Bufkin during the 2024-25 term.

Editor\u2019s Note: Law Week Colorado edits court opinion summaries for style and, when necessary, length. Bufkin v. Collins The Department of Veterans Affairs applies a \u201cbenefit-of-the-doubt rule\u201d that tips the scales in a veteran\u2019s favor when evidence regarding any issue material to a service-related disability claim is in \u201capproximate balance.\u201d The petitioners in this case are veterans who applied for service-connected post-traumatic stress disorder disability benefits and were dissatisfied with the VA\u2019s resolution of their claims. Joshua Bufkin claimed that his PTSD stemmed from his military service, but the VA found no clear link. Norman Thornton obtained service-connected PTSD disability benefits, but the VA denied his most recent request to increase his disability rating. These adverse determinations were reviewed de novo by the Board of Veterans\u2019 Appeals, which rendered final decisions on behalf of the VA denying the claims. Bufkin and Thornton then challenged the adverse determinations before the U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims. The veterans court reviews legal issues de novo and factual issues for clear error. The Veterans Court must \u201ctake due account\u201d of the VA\u2019s application of the benefit-of-the-doubt rule. Applying those standards, the Veterans Court affirmed the VA\u2019s adverse benefit determinations, finding that the board\u2019s approximate-balance determinations were not clearly erroneous. Bufkin and Thornton appealed to the federal circuit, challenging the veterans court\u2019s legal interpretation of Section 7261(b)(1), and arguing that the statutory command to \u201ctake due account\u201d of the VA\u2019s application of the benefit-of-the-doubt rule requires the veterans court to review the entire record de novo and decide for itself whether the evidence is in approximate balance. The federal circuit rejected this argument and affirmed. The U.S. Supreme Court held that the VA\u2019s determination that the evidence regarding a service-related disability claim is in \u201capproximate balance\u201d is a predominantly factual determination reviewed only for clear error. The court found that under Section 7261(b)(1)\u2019s plain text, the Veterans Court must \u201ctake due account\u201d of the VA\u2019s application of the benefit-of-the-doubt rule. It noted this requirement directs the Veterans Court to give appropriate attention to the VA\u2019s work. The veterans court must review the VA\u2019s application of the benefit-of-the-doubt rule \u201c[i]n making the determinations under subsection (a).\u201d The high court explained that the standards of review provided in subsection (a) also govern the Veterans Court\u2019s review of benefit-of-the-doubt issues. Section 7261(b)(1) makes explicit the veterans court\u2019s previously implicit duty to review the VA\u2019s application of the benefit-of-the-doubt rule, pursuant to the standards set forth in subsection (a). The Supreme Court noted that Bufkin and Thornton urged that by amending Section 7261(b)(1) to include the modest phrase, \u201ctake due account,\u201d Congress imposed a new standard of review for challenges to the VA\u2019s application of the benefit-of the-doubt rule. But the high court reasoned that had Congress intended to do so, it would have identified a standard, just as it did in Section 7261(a). Bufkin and Thornton next argued that, even if Section 7261(b)(1) incorporates Section 7261(a)\u2019s standards of review, the VA\u2019s approximate-balance determination is much like a court\u2019s probable-cause determination, which involves a mixed-question inquiry that appellate courts review de novo. But the high court explained that two features distinguish the probable-cause determination from the VA\u2019s determination here. First, probable cause is a constitutional standard, creating a strong presumption that determinations under that standard are subject to de novo review. By contrast, the approximate-balance determination is a creature of statute, not the Constitution. Second, probable cause poses a question that requires substantial \u201clegal work,\u201d but the VA\u2019s approximate-balance determination lacks a comparable legal component. Bufkin and Thornton also contended that the federal circuit\u2019s reading of Section 7261(b)(1) renders the provision superfluous. While the Supreme Court noted its reading of Section 7261(b)(1) might involve some redundancy, the canon against surplusage doesn\u2019t apply here because petitioners haven\u2019t identified a competing interpretation that would avoid redundancy. The high court affirmed the lower court\u2019s decision. Justice Clarence Thomas delivered the opinion of the court, in which Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Samuel Alito Jr, Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett joined. Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson filed a dissenting opinion, in which Justice Neil Gorsuch joined. \u201cNothing about the text, context, or drafting history of subsection (b)(1) demonstrates that \u201ctake due account\u201d actually means \u2018proceed as normal,\u2019\u201d Jackson wrote in the dissenting opinion. \u201cReading the provision in that fashion, as the majority does, makes little sense.\u201d The dissenting justices asserted such an interpretation is inconsistent with how the court has treated identical language elsewhere in the same statute and that it renders meaningless the \u201ctake due account\u201d command. \u201cThe majority\u2019s clear-error conclusion fares no better, insofar as its reasoning ignores what appellate courts do and what we have consistently said about substantially similar circumstances,\u201d Jackson wrote. \u201cIn short, the Court today concludes that Congress meant nothing when it inserted subsection (b)(1) in response to concerns that the Veterans Court was improperly rubberstamping the VA\u2019s benefit-of-the-doubt determinations, and also that the Veterans Court is not obliged to do anything more than defer to those agency decisions notwithstanding Congress\u2019s \u2018take due account\u2019 direction,\u201d the dissenting justices asserted.

Back to Blog Blog Post Veterans take another battle to the U.S. Supreme Court October 14, 2024 | by Marcia Coyle More in Constitution Daily Blog Many of the nation\u2019s veterans have fought battles with the federal agency responsible for awarding benefits for their service-connected injuries and illnesses. This week, the veterans fight again, but in the U.S. Supreme Court. Over the years, their battles with the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs often involved complaints about an unwieldy, lengthy, ultimately unfair, claims process that seemed to defeat the intention to create a non-adversarial, veteran-friendly system. Over time, Congress did respond to some veterans\u2019 complaints and lawsuits. One important change was Congress\u2019 creation in 1988 of the U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims. That court is tasked with hearing veterans\u2019 appeals from allegedly erroneous decisions on their claims by the department\u2019s board of veterans appeals. The backstop to that court is the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. Joshua Bufkin, an Air Force veteran, and Norman Thornton, an Army veteran, separately sought disability benefits for service-connected, post-traumatic stress disorder. Their claims were denied by the board of veterans appeals and those decisions were subsequently affirmed by the Veterans Court. In Bufkin v. McDonough at the Supreme Court, the two veterans argue that the Veterans Court and the Federal Circuit has been misapplying a federal rule that is central to review of veterans\u2019 claims, \u201cbut its practical benefit to veterans is being eroded by the Federal Circuit\u2019s narrow reading of the scope and standard of review available to veterans at the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims,\u201d according to an amicus brief by a group of lawyers who frequently represent veterans pro bono. For more than 100 years, veterans have been entitled to the benefit of the doubt on any close issue material to their eligibility for service-related benefits. When Congress created the Veterans Court in 1988, it wrote the benefit-of-the-doubt rule into the 1988 act. The rule states: \u201cw]hen there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, the Secretary [of Veterans Affairs] shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant.\u201d In 2002, Congress added something like an exclamation point to the law, stating that in deciding every appeal, the Veterans Court \u201cshall review the record of proceedings and \u201cshall take due account of the Secretary\u2019s application of [the benefit-of-the-doubt statute].\u201d This provision, according to legislative reports, was adopted to give \u201cfull force to the \u2018benefit of the doubt\u2019 provision\u2019\u201d by empowering the Veterans Court to conduct more \u201csearching appellate review\u201d of department decisions. \u201cThe rule that the veteran, not the government, receives the benefit of the doubt in a close case is among the most fundamental and longstanding precepts in our veterans\u2019 benefits system,\u201d wrote Melanie Bostwick, who represents Bufkin and Thornton. \u201cThis standard of proof, unlike any other in civil or criminal litigation, reflects a core societal judgment that it is better to err on the side of providing benefits to those who sacrificed their own interests on behalf of the nation.\u201d Her clients have drawn supporting amicus briefs from Disabled American Veterans, Military-Veterans Advocacy, National Veterans Legal Services Program (NVLSP), and the Federal Circuit Bar Association, whose members practice before the Federal Circuit and represent or facilitate pro bono counsel for veterans. Bufkin and Thornton argue that the Veterans Court is required to make an independent, non-deferential review of the evidence before the department to determine whether there were close issues on which the veteran should have received the benefit of the doubt. The Veterans Court, they contend, is not taking that hard, independent look. \u00a0It is only examining the underlying factual findings for deferential clear error \u2014 \u201csomething already required elsewhere in the veterans\u2019 review statute.\u201d The Federal Circuit has agreed with the Veterans Court that clear error review is all that is required. The Biden Administration counters that the Secretary\u2019s decision that the evidence on a material issue is not in \u201capproximate balance,\u201d is itself a factual finding and so is subject only to review for clear errors. If a claimant challenges the board\u2019s weighing of the evidence on a material issue, and the Veterans Court concludes that the Secretary\u2019s approximate-balance determination is not clearly erroneous, the government contends, the court has taken \u201cdue account\u201d of the Secretary\u2019s application of the benefit-of-the-doubt rule. The National Veterans Legal Services Program argues that the text and structure of the law indicate, the \u201ctake due account\u201d provision requires the Veterans Court to separately consider the Secretary\u2019s application of the benefit-of-the-doubt rule, and that\u00a0 would improve outcomes for veterans and reduce delays in the benefits application and review process. \u201cCase backlogs have increased as remands from the Veterans Court congest the [Board of Veterans Appeals] docket, and veterans are forced to wait even longer for resolution\u201d wrote D. Shayon Ghosh for the NVLSP.\u00a0 \u201cIn short, veterans organizations like NVLSP have explained to Congress that the Veterans Court\u2019s toothless review of the benefit-of-the-doubt rule regularly resulted in misapplication of that rule and unnecessary remands that cost veterans valuable time.\u201d What is the proper standard of judicial review is a technical, even wonky, issue. And may not make for the most scintillating oral arguments. But, as the veterans\u2019 challenge here shows, the answer can be critical to the outcome of questions with often huge significance in someone\u2019s life. The justices will hear arguments on Oct. 16. You can tune in by going to https://www.supremecourt.gov and clicking on live audio.

On Monday, April 29, the Supreme Court of the United States agreed to hear a case this fall with the potential to significantly broaden U.S. veterans\u2019 opportunities to receive VA benefits.[1] The case, Bufkin v. McDonough, centers on two veterans\u2014Joshua Bufkin and Norman Thornton\u2014who were denied medical benefits by the Department of Veterans Affairs and Board of Veterans Appeals (\u201cBVA\u201d).[2] Bufkin and Thornton each sought VA benefits for PTSD in connection with their military service, but were denied after the VA decided that examinations by VA psychologists outweighed the veterans\u2019 prior examinations and diagnoses.[3] These rulings were reviewed and affirmed by the U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (the \u201cVeterans Court\u201d), which found merely that the BVA didn\u2019t make any clear mistakes about the facts of the petitioners\u2019 cases.[4] Bufkin and Thornton appealed the Veterans Court decisions, arguing that these denials violated a principle called the \u201cbenefit-of-the-doubt\u201d rule.[5] They lost their cases at the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals, but now that the Supreme Court has accepted their petition for review, they have a new shot at changing the way that the VA thinks about veterans\u2019 benefits.[6] The Benefit-of-the-Doubt Rule Boiled down to basics, Bufkin v. McDonough is about the application of the benefit-of-the-doubt rule to appeals of BVA decisions. The benefit-of-the-doubt rule is a well-established policy in veterans\u2019 law: when the evidence in favor of and against a veteran\u2019s benefits claim is approximately balanced, the VA department should rule in favor of the veteran\u2019s claim.[7]\u00a0 In 1988, Congress codified the benefit-of-the-doubt rule into law as 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 5107(b): (b) Benefit of the doubt. The Secretary [of Veteran\u2019s Affairs] shall consider all information and lay and medical evidence of record in a case before the Secretary with respect to benefits under laws administered by the Secretary. When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, the secretary shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant.[8] This mandate applies to disability and benefits determinations by the VA office and BVA, and is further established within the Department of Veterans Affairs\u2019 own regulations\u2014when there is a reasonable doubt about some aspect of a VA disability claim, and the evidence is about the same weight on either side, that doubt should be resolved in favor of the claimant.[9] In 2002, Congress passed the Veterans\u2019 Benefits Act (\u201cVBA\u201d), modifying the Veterans Court\u2019s power to review BVA decisions.[10] The language in one part of the VBA, 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7261, forms the basis of Bufkin\u2019s issue in controversy.[11] Section 7261(a) requires the Veterans Court (when reviewing BVA decisions) to decide legal questions; compel unlawfully-withheld action by the Secretary of Veterans\u2019 Affairs; set aside BVA decisions that are arbitrary, capricious, unconstitutional, unlawful, or lacking in due procedure; and reverse findings of fact that are \u201cclearly erroneous.\u201d[12] Section 7261(b) states that when the Veterans Court makes a determination on an appeal from the BVA, \u201cthe Court shall review the record of proceedings before the Secretary and the Board of Veterans\u2019 Appeals . . . and shall take due account of the Secretary\u2019s application of [the benefit-of-the-doubt rule].\u201d[13] Bufkin and Thornton argued that under the VBA\u2019s Section 7261(b), the Veterans Court must conduct a much more generous review of closely-balanced issues than it did before.[14] If Congress\u2019s passage of the VBA is to mean anything at all, they claim, then it must require deeper attention to benefit-of-the-doubt on appeal.[15] Bufkin\u2019s Federal Circuit holding and arguments before the Supreme Court In August 2023, the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals ruled on Bufkin and Thornton\u2019s cases and rejected their more generous interpretation of Section 7261.[16] The Federal Circuit held that under Section 7261(b), the Veterans Court is only required to examine BVA findings and applications of the benefit-of-the-doubt rule for clear error\u2014the same scope and standard of review permitted by Section 7261(a).[17] Clear error is a difficult standard to meet in a lawsuit. Under this ruling, the Veterans Court has no obligation to separately review whether or not a veteran actually received the benefit of the doubt on close material issues of a case; only whether or not the BVA made an obvious factual mistake when applying it.[18] Bufkin and Thornton\u2019s petition to the Supreme Court argues that Section 7261(b) requires the Veterans Court to conduct a separate analysis of whether or not a veteran received the benefit of the doubt on close disputed issues before the VA Department and BVA\u2014regardless of whether the BVA made \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d factual findings under 7261(a), and regardless of whether or not a veteran claimant accused the BVA of factual error or inappropriate application of the benefit-of-the-doubt rule on appeal.[19] The reading of Section 7261 proposed by Bufkin and Thornton is much broader than the Federal Circuit\u2019s rule. If the Supreme Court affirms the Federal Circuit, the old rule will remain in place\u2014but if the Supreme Court chooses to agree with the petitioners, it could open up a whole new world for veterans across the country to challenge past disability determinations where the VA failed to give enough deference to their needs. Permitting broader review by courts appealing VA decisions may allow veterans with close cases to successfully receive needed benefits, where previously the Veterans Court might not have given their cases a deeper look. The current Supreme Court justices have proven themselves sympathetic to veterans\u2019 needs in another recent decision, Rudisill v. McDonough, where a 7-2 majority voted to broaden access to overlapping GI Bill benefits[20]\u2014so keep an eye on Bufkin during the 2024-25 term.

Editor\u2019s Note: Law Week Colorado edits court opinion summaries for style and, when necessary, length. Bufkin v. Collins The Department of Veterans Affairs applies a \u201cbenefit-of-the-doubt rule\u201d that tips the scales in a veteran\u2019s favor when evidence regarding any issue material to a service-related disability claim is in \u201capproximate balance.\u201d The petitioners in this case are veterans who applied for service-connected post-traumatic stress disorder disability benefits and were dissatisfied with the VA\u2019s resolution of their claims. Joshua Bufkin claimed that his PTSD stemmed from his military service, but the VA found no clear link. Norman Thornton obtained service-connected PTSD disability benefits, but the VA denied his most recent request to increase his disability rating. These adverse determinations were reviewed de novo by the Board of Veterans\u2019 Appeals, which rendered final decisions on behalf of the VA denying the claims. Bufkin and Thornton then challenged the adverse determinations before the U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims. The veterans court reviews legal issues de novo and factual issues for clear error. The Veterans Court must \u201ctake due account\u201d of the VA\u2019s application of the benefit-of-the-doubt rule. Applying those standards, the Veterans Court affirmed the VA\u2019s adverse benefit determinations, finding that the board\u2019s approximate-balance determinations were not clearly erroneous. Bufkin and Thornton appealed to the federal circuit, challenging the veterans court\u2019s legal interpretation of Section 7261(b)(1), and arguing that the statutory command to \u201ctake due account\u201d of the VA\u2019s application of the benefit-of-the-doubt rule requires the veterans court to review the entire record de novo and decide for itself whether the evidence is in approximate balance. The federal circuit rejected this argument and affirmed. The U.S. Supreme Court held that the VA\u2019s determination that the evidence regarding a service-related disability claim is in \u201capproximate balance\u201d is a predominantly factual determination reviewed only for clear error. The court found that under Section 7261(b)(1)\u2019s plain text, the Veterans Court must \u201ctake due account\u201d of the VA\u2019s application of the benefit-of-the-doubt rule. It noted this requirement directs the Veterans Court to give appropriate attention to the VA\u2019s work. The veterans court must review the VA\u2019s application of the benefit-of-the-doubt rule \u201c[i]n making the determinations under subsection (a).\u201d The high court explained that the standards of review provided in subsection (a) also govern the Veterans Court\u2019s review of benefit-of-the-doubt issues. Section 7261(b)(1) makes explicit the veterans court\u2019s previously implicit duty to review the VA\u2019s application of the benefit-of-the-doubt rule, pursuant to the standards set forth in subsection (a). The Supreme Court noted that Bufkin and Thornton urged that by amending Section 7261(b)(1) to include the modest phrase, \u201ctake due account,\u201d Congress imposed a new standard of review for challenges to the VA\u2019s application of the benefit-of the-doubt rule. But the high court reasoned that had Congress intended to do so, it would have identified a standard, just as it did in Section 7261(a). Bufkin and Thornton next argued that, even if Section 7261(b)(1) incorporates Section 7261(a)\u2019s standards of review, the VA\u2019s approximate-balance determination is much like a court\u2019s probable-cause determination, which involves a mixed-question inquiry that appellate courts review de novo. But the high court explained that two features distinguish the probable-cause determination from the VA\u2019s determination here. First, probable cause is a constitutional standard, creating a strong presumption that determinations under that standard are subject to de novo review. By contrast, the approximate-balance determination is a creature of statute, not the Constitution. Second, probable cause poses a question that requires substantial \u201clegal work,\u201d but the VA\u2019s approximate-balance determination lacks a comparable legal component. Bufkin and Thornton also contended that the federal circuit\u2019s reading of Section 7261(b)(1) renders the provision superfluous. While the Supreme Court noted its reading of Section 7261(b)(1) might involve some redundancy, the canon against surplusage doesn\u2019t apply here because petitioners haven\u2019t identified a competing interpretation that would avoid redundancy. The high court affirmed the lower court\u2019s decision. Justice Clarence Thomas delivered the opinion of the court, in which Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Samuel Alito Jr, Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett joined. Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson filed a dissenting opinion, in which Justice Neil Gorsuch joined. \u201cNothing about the text, context, or drafting history of subsection (b)(1) demonstrates that \u201ctake due account\u201d actually means \u2018proceed as normal,\u2019\u201d Jackson wrote in the dissenting opinion. \u201cReading the provision in that fashion, as the majority does, makes little sense.\u201d The dissenting justices asserted such an interpretation is inconsistent with how the court has treated identical language elsewhere in the same statute and that it renders meaningless the \u201ctake due account\u201d command. \u201cThe majority\u2019s clear-error conclusion fares no better, insofar as its reasoning ignores what appellate courts do and what we have consistently said about substantially similar circumstances,\u201d Jackson wrote. \u201cIn short, the Court today concludes that Congress meant nothing when it inserted subsection (b)(1) in response to concerns that the Veterans Court was improperly rubberstamping the VA\u2019s benefit-of-the-doubt determinations, and also that the Veterans Court is not obliged to do anything more than defer to those agency decisions notwithstanding Congress\u2019s \u2018take due account\u2019 direction,\u201d the dissenting justices asserted.

          "task_beliefs": "My prediction in favor of the petitioner, Soto, has significantly strengthened. The acquisition of the National Law School Veterans Clinic Consortium (NLSVCC) amicus brief resolved the primary remaining uncertainty in my model of the case\u2014the lack of an evidence-based rebuttal to the government's policy arguments\u2014and added a powerful new dimension to the petitioner's case.\n\n*   **Initial State:** My prediction favored the petitioner based on a purposive reading of the Combat-Related Special Compensation (CRSC) statute and the pro-veteran canon.\n*   **Equilibrium:** The government's brief created equipoise by introducing a strong formalist argument requiring a \"clear statement\" from Congress to override the Barring Act's general time limit.\n*   **Shift to Petitioner:** The petitioner's reply brief shifted the balance back by arguing that the CRSC statute's specific language authorizing the Secretary to \"settle\" claims *is* the required clear statement, a clever co-option of the government's own textualist framework.\n*   **Amicus Signal:** The identification of the NLSVCC as an amicus provided a positive signal, given their expertise, but the substantive content was unknown. The key uncertainty became whether this brief would provide the factual and policy arguments needed to counter the government's \"floodgates\" concerns.\n*   **Current Understanding (Post-Amicus Brief):** The NLSVCC amicus brief is a highly consequential piece of evidence that solidifies the case for the petitioner. It accomplishes two critical things:\n    1.  **It provides the missing policy and factual counter-argument.** As hypothesized, the brief directly addresses why a strict six-year time limit is particularly unjust for this population. Citing extensive medical and sociological research (from sources like the *New England Journal of Medicine* and RAND), it argues that combat trauma, PTSD, TBI, and challenges of \"reculturation\" create significant barriers that impede veterans from filing claims in a timely manner. This transforms the pro-veteran canon from a generic tie-breaker into a fact-supported, just principle to be applied in this specific context, effectively neutralizing the government's abstract policy concerns.\n    2.  **It adds a historical and purposive pillar to the petitioner's textual argument.** The brief traces the history of veterans' benefits, arguing that Congress has a long tradition of treating compensation for combat wounds as a distinct and more \"sacred\" category than \"workaday\" employment benefits like retired pay. By framing CRSC within this tradition, it powerfully reinforces the petitioner's argument that the statute's plain text\u2014\"Payments under this section are not retired pay\" (10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1413a(g))\u2014should be taken at face value, and that the Federal Circuit erred by lumping CRSC in with the types of claims covered by the Barring Act.\n\nMy confidence in a pro-petitioner outcome is now very high. The petitioner's position is supported by a three-pronged attack: a sophisticated textual argument, a compelling historical/purposive argument, and a robust, evidence-based policy argument. The government is left defending a narrow formalist interpretation that appears increasingly detached from the statute's text, purpose, and real-world impact.",
          "design_beliefs": "This observation provides powerful validation for my evolving methodology and introduces new, valuable heuristics for legal analysis. The successful retrieval and analysis of this document is a direct result of the \"Reflect-Diagnose-Plan\" cycle.\n\n*   **Cumulative Methodology (Validated and Reinforced):**\n    1.  **Synthesize and Strategize:** The \"Reflect and Plan\" step is critical.\n    2.  **Prioritize Primary Sources:** Core docket files are the highest-value data.\n    3.  **Analyze Holistically:** Looking for presence and absence of arguments is key.\n    4.  **Reconstruct Arguments Symmetrically:** Modeling both sides is essential.\n    5.  **Targeted Uncertainty Reduction:** The most effective guiding principle.\n    6.  **Distinguish Document Types:** The role of each brief type is a crucial distinction.\n    7.  **The \"Reflect and Plan\" Step:** A cornerstone of efficient inquiry.\n    8.  **Sequential Planning:** A logical progression (party briefs -> amicus briefs) is efficient.\n    9.  **Heuristic: Identify \"Argumentative Co-option\".** A powerful rhetorical and logical move.\n    10. **Heuristic: Watch for \"Waiver\" Claims.** A key procedural off-ramp for courts.\n    11. **Substantive Legal Concept: \"Settlement\" vs. \"Payment\".** A durable piece of administrative law knowledge.\n    12. **Meta-Heuristic: The \"Parade of Horribles\" Pattern.** Recognizing this common rhetorical tactic.\n    13. **Heuristic Validation: The Power of the `THINK` Step.** Meta-cognition is a core driver of efficient inquiry.\n    14. **Heuristic: Precision in Search and Filtering Procedural Noise.** A crucial lesson in tool use, requiring query specificity and distinguishing substantive from procedural filings. This was directly validated by the success of the filtered search.\n    15. **Meta-Heuristic: Extracting Value from Incomplete Results.** A \"failed\" search can still yield high-value metadata. This was validated, as the prior metadata-only result was the essential step leading to this successful retrieval.\n    16. **Meta-Heuristic: The Reflect-Diagnose-Plan Cycle.** This observation is the successful output of this cycle, proving its practical value in turning a suboptimal outcome (procedural noise) into a highly successful, targeted action.\n\n*   **New Refinements and Heuristics from this Observation:**\n    17. **Heuristic: The \"Amicus Brief as Policy Backstop.\"** This observation reveals a key function of amicus briefs filed by expert groups (like the NLSVCC). They often provide the empirical, social-scientific, or real-world factual context (\"Brandeis brief\" style evidence) that parties, focused on pure legal doctrine, may not. When one party makes a policy-based \"parade of horribles\" argument, I should actively prioritize finding amicus briefs from relevant expert groups on the opposing side, as they are the most likely source for a direct, evidence-based rebuttal.\n    18. **Heuristic: The \"Historical Context as Purposive Argument.\"** The NLSVCC brief demonstrates how deep historical analysis of a statutory scheme can construct a powerful purposive argument that complements a textualist one. It shows that the \"history and tradition\" lens is not limited to constitutional law but can be used to illuminate congressional intent and distinguish different categories of benefits in statutory cases. This is a valuable method for bolstering a textual reading with a compelling narrative about legislative purpose."

      "eig_reasoning": "My current model has been upended by the discovery of the *Bufkin* analog, which strongly suggests a formalist, structuralist majority will favor the government's 'clear statement' argument. My primary remaining uncertainty is whether Soto has a compelling argument to *distinguish* this case from the *Bufkin* logic. The most plausible distinguishing argument is that the CRSC statute is a completely self-contained scheme to which the Barring Act is simply inapplicable, rather than being a statute that implicitly overrides it.\n\nThis action directly targets that single, critical point of uncertainty. \n\n**Task EIG (0.8):** The information gain for the task is very high. If the search reveals strong, specific textual and structural evidence from the petitioner's brief for the 'self-contained scheme' theory, it provides a clear path for the Court to rule for Soto without contradicting the logic of *Bufkin*. This would significantly increase my confidence in a pro-petitioner outcome. Conversely, if the search reveals the argument is merely conclusory or weak, it will confirm that the *Bufkin* analog is likely fatal, solidifying my prediction for the government. Either way, my posterior belief will shift significantly, and my uncertainty will be substantially reduced.\n\n**Design EIG (0.5):** The design gain is moderate but important. This action models a crucial strategic response to a paradigm-shifting discovery. It moves beyond initial source analysis to a more sophisticated, recursive step: 'When a powerful external analog is found, re-interrogate the primary sources to find the best version of a distinguishing argument.' This refines the 'Analyze Holistically' heuristic into a more dynamic, responsive process. It demonstrates the importance of not just finding new information, but using it to guide a more focused re-evaluation of existing information, which is a valuable and repeatable strategy.",

The design beliefs reflect advanced meta-cognitive strategies, including validation of a cumulative methodology, integration of new heuristics on analogical reasoning, predictive simulation, and interpretation hierarchies, showing complex strategic reasoning. Both sets of beliefs are internally consistent and well-integrated, with no evident contradictions, and the information density is very high, containing detailed legal concepts, procedural insights, and methodological refinements.

Soto, \nand the class members he represents, are entitled to \nCombat-Related Special Compensation (\u201cCRSC\u201d)\u2014a \nmonthly benefit that Congress specifically authorized \nfor veterans who are disabled as a result of combat-\nrelated injuries incurred while serving in the United \nStates military. There is also no question that Cor-\nporal Soto is entitled to CRSC payments both going \nforward from the time his application was received and \nretroactively. The only question before this Court is \nwhether Corporal Soto may receive CRSC payments \nfor every month during which he was eligible under \nthe statute that authorizes CRSC, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1413a. \nThe government said no, contending that with respect \nto retroactive payments, Corporal Soto may obtain \nCRSC only for the six years before he applied. \nAlthough the CRSC statute imposes no time limit for \na veteran to apply for CRSC payments, the govern-\nment contends that the availability of CRSC payments \nis limited by a different statute, the Barring Act, 37 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 3702. The Barring Act is a gap-filling statute, \nauthorizing various agencies to \u201csettle\u201d an administra-\ntive claim against the United States\u2014i.e., to adminis-\ntratively determine whether the claim is valid and the \namount due\u2014in the event that no \u201c[]other law\u201d author-\nizes settlement of the claim. Id. \u00a7 3702(a). If a claim is \nsettled under the Barring Act, then it is subject to the \nBarring Act\u2019s six-year statute of limitations. Id. \n\u00a7 3702(b). But the Barring Act has no application to \nclaims for CRSC, because the CRSC statute authorizes \nsettlement of such claims. \nSpecifically, the CRSC statute authorizes the Secre-\ntaries of the military departments to determine both \nthe validity of claims for CRSC and the amount owed \n\n2 \n \nto eligible veterans\u2014all that is entailed in claims set-\ntlement. The Secretary concerned is directed to con-\nsider a veteran\u2019s application for CRSC under CRSC-\nspecific \u201cprocedures and criteria\u201d prescribed by the De-\npartment of Defense\u2014and thereby determine whether \nthe veteran is eligible for (and thus has a valid claim \nto) CRSC. 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1413a(d). The Secretary con-\ncerned is further directed to \u201cdetermine[]\u201d the monthly \namount owed to an eligible veteran using the process \nset forth in subsection (b). Id. \u00a7 1413a(a), (b). Because \nthe CRSC statute authorizes the Secretary concerned \nto determine the validity of a claim to CRSC and the \namount due, that statute specifically authorizes settle-\nment of claims like Corporal Soto\u2019s to CRSC\u2014and the \ngap-filling Barring Act accordingly has no application. \nThe judgment below should be reversed. \nDECISIONS BELOW  \nThe opinion of the Federal Circuit is reported at Soto \nv. United States, 92 F.4th 1094 (Fed. Cir. 2024), and \nreproduced at Pet. App. 1a\u201319a. The opinion of the \nSouthern District of Texas granting summary judg-\nment for petitioner is unreported, but is available at \n2021 WL 7287022, and reproduced at Pet.

The Federal Circuit \ndenied petitioner\u2019s timely petition for rehearing en \nbanc on June 20, 2024. Pet. App. 40a. The petition for \n\n3 \n \nwrit of certiorari was filed on September 18, 2024. This \nCourt has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254(1). \nSTATUTORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED  \nThe relevant statutory and regulatory provisions are \nreproduced at Pet. App. 42a\u201347a. The statute address-\ning Combat-Related Special Compensation, 10 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1413a, is reproduced at Pet. App. 42a. The Barring \nAct, 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3702, is reproduced at Pet. App. 45a.  \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nA. \nCombat-Related Special Compensation \n1. On December 2, 2002, Congress enacted the CRSC \nstatute to recognize and additionally compensate a se-\nlect and particularly deserving group of uniformed ser-\nvices retirees. The CRSC statute is unique in both \nwhom it serves and how it operates. In most cases, \nCongress prohibits simultaneous receipt of military re-\ntirement pay and Department of Veterans Affairs \n(\u201cVA\u201d) benefits. Congress first barred concurrent re-\nceipt of both military retirement pay and veteran\u2019s dis-\nability pension in 1891. Congressional Research Ser-\nvice, Concurrent Receipt of Military Retired Pay and \nVeteran Disability: Background and Issues for Con-\ngress (June 22, 2023), available at https://crsre-\nports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R40589/18 at 5. That \nprohibition remained in place until 1944, when Con-\ngress eased the prohibition by allowing retired mili-\ntary personnel to waive part of their retirement pay to \nreceive veteran\u2019s disability compensation. Act of May \n27, 1944, ch. 209, 58 Stat. 230, 230\u201331. This change \nwas modest, allowing some retirees to draw at least a \npartial disability benefit, which is nontaxable. Id.; 26 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 104(a)(4) & (b)(2)(D). But still, the law prohib-\nited concurrent receipt of both benefit types because it \nrequired any moneys received from veteran\u2019s disability \n\n4 \n \ncompensation to be subtracted from any retirement \nfunds received. Act of May 27, 1944, ch. 209, 58 Stat. \n230, 230\u201331. Hoping for better, veterans and advocacy \ngroups pushed for a change in law to allow receipt of \nall or some of both payments. \nIn 1999, Congress partially heeded that call. The \n1999 statute, Special Compensation for Severely Disa-\nbled Military Retirees, relaxed the prohibition on du-\nplicate benefits (also called concurrent receipt) by al-\nlowing veterans with at least 20 years of military ser-\nvice and a VA service-connected disability rated at 70 \npercent or higher to receive some monthly retirement \nbenefit. See Nat\u2019l Def. Authorization Act for Fiscal \nYear 2000, Pub. L. No. 106-65, \u00a7 658(a)(1), 113 Stat. \n512, 668\u201369 (1999). While this statute represented \nprogress, both the number of persons eligible and the \namount of compensation were minimal: the monthly \nbenefit maxed out at $300 and was available only to \nthe most severely disabled veterans. Id. \nCongress\u2019s enactment of the CRSC statute a few \nyears later represented a sea change. The program in-\ntroduced a higher cash benefit, closer to what concur-\nrent receipt would provide. However, in implementing \nthis change, Congress still saw fit to limit the benefit \nto a select group of military retirees whose service \nwrought some of the greatest sacrifices.1  \nA provision of the Bob Stump National Defense Au-\nthorization Act of 2003, the CRSC statute authorized \n \n1 Congress also enacted Concurrent Retirement and Disability \nPay (\u201cCRDP\u201d) in 2004, which allows longevity military retirees to \nreceive both military retired pay and VA disability compensation. \nNat\u2019l Def. Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2004, Pub. L. No. 108-\n136, \u00a7 641(a), 117 Stat. 1392, 1511\u201314 (2003). A veteran cannot \nreceive both CRSC and CRDP; if a veteran qualifies for both pay-\nments, the default payment will be the higher of the two.  \n\n5 \n \ncompensation to military retirees who either (1) sus-\ntained a disability that is \u201cattributable to an injury for \nwhich the member was awarded the Purple Heart\u201d and \nis assigned at least a 10% disability rating by the VA; \nor (2) had a disability rated at least 60% by the VA re-\nsulting from involvement in armed conflict, hazardous \nservice, duty simulating war, or through an instru-\nmentality of war. Bob Stump Nat\u2019l Def. Authorization \nAct for Fiscal Year 2003, Pub. L. No. 107-314, \u00a7 636, \n116 Stat. 2458, 2574\u201376 (2002) (codified as amended \nat 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1413a(e)). Since its inception, Congress \nhas amended and expanded the CRSC statute to pro-\nvide benefits to thousands of additional veterans with \ncombat-related disabilities.  \nAt first, the statute limited eligibility for CRSC to \nlongevity retirees (those who completed at least \ntwenty years of service). Pub. L. No. 107-314, \u00a7 636; 10 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 1413a(c)(1). The 2004 NDAA removed the \n60% disability rating threshold for longevity retirees. \nPub. L. No. 108-136, \u00a7 642. The 2008 NDAA further \nexpanded CRSC eligibility to anyone medically re-\ntired, including retirees with fewer than twenty years \nof service, effective January 1, 2008. Nat\u2019l Def. Author-\nization Act for Fiscal Year 2008, Pub. L. No. 110-181, \n122 Stat. 3 (2008).  \nTo be clear, the CRSC statute does not end the re-\nquirement that a retiree\u2019s military retired pay be re-\nduced by the amount of their total VA disability com-\npensation. 38 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5304, 5305. Instead, CRSC \nbeneficiaries receive \u201cspecial compensation\u201d: a partic-\nular, Congressionally authorized payment to select re-\ntirees that is in addition to whatever amount the vet-\neran is authorized to receive in military retirement \nand VA disability compensation. In contrast, a medical \nretiree who sustained a service-connected but non-\ncombat-related injury would not be eligible for such \n\n6 \n \nspecial compensation. Additionally, unlike some other \nmilitary or VA benefits, CRSC is available only to the \nveteran from the time the veteran becomes eligible to \nthe end of the veteran\u2019s life\u2014it does not extend to sur-\nviving spouses or other heirs. See 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1413a(a), \n(c).  \nThe CRSC statute stands apart as the first and only \nform of compensation that distinguishes veterans \nwounded as a result of combat. Neither VA service-\nconnected disability compensation nor longevity re-\ntirement nor medical retirement requires the veteran \nbeneficiary to suffer injury related to combat. See, e.g., \n38 U.S.C. \u00a7 1110 (VA basic entitlement\u2014time of war); \n38 U.S.C. \u00a7 1131 (VA basic entitlement\u2014peacetime); \n10 U.S.C. \u00a7 633 (longevity retirement for certain offic-\ners not recommended for promotion with 28 years of \nactive commissioned service); 10 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7  1201\u20131204 \n(military medical retirement); 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1293 (lon-\ngevity retirement for warrant officers with 20 years of \nservice); 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 12731 (reservist longevity retire-\nment). As such, the statute carves out unique benefits \nto a tailored group of retired service members whom \nlegislators singled out as particularly deserving. See \n148 Cong. Rec. S10,859 (daily ed. Nov. 13, 2002) (state-\nment of Sen. Harry Reid) (stating that the injured vet-\nerans aided by CRSC \u201cdeserve it as much as anyone \ndeserves anything in the world\u201d); id. at S10,860 (state-\nment of Sen. John Warner) (CRSC is \u201ccompensation \nfor those veterans we deemed formed that category de-\nserving of added funds\u201d). \n2. The CRSC statute provides: \u201cThe Secretary con-\ncerned shall pay to each eligible combat-related disa-\nbled uniformed services retiree who elects benefits un-\nder this section a monthly amount for the combat-re-\nlated disability of the retiree determined under \n\n7 \n \nsubsection (b).\u201d 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1413a(a).2 The statute goes \non to define how the Secretary concerned is to deter-\nmine which applicants for CRSC are eligible and how \nmuch each eligible applicant is to be paid. \nThe statutory term \u201celigible combat-related disabled \nuniformed services retiree\u201d is defined in subsection (c) \nto mean a service member who both is entitled to re-\ntired pay and has a \u201ccombat-related disability.\u201d The \nterm \u201ccombat-related disability\u201d is defined in subsec-\ntion (e) to mean a disability that is attributable to an \ninjury for which the member was awarded the Purple \nHeart or that was incurred in armed conflict, through \nan instrumentality of war, under conditions simulat-\ning war or other hazardous activity. Whether an appli-\ncant is eligible under the statutory definitions is to be \n\u201cconsidered\u201d by the Secretary concerned according to \n\u201cprocedures and criteria\u201d that the Secretary of Defense \nhas prescribed. Id. \u00a7 1413a(d); see also Joint Appendix \n(\u201cJA\u201d) 77\u2013107 (January 2004 Guidance promulgated \nby the Department of Defense pursuant to subsection \n(d));  JA 108\u2013113 (January 2008 Supplemental Guid-\nance promulgated by Department of Defense pursuant \nto subsection (d)). \nThe amount to be paid to eligible applicants is set \nforth in subsection (b) of the statute. That provision \ndetails how to determine \u201cthe monthly amount to be \npaid an eligible combat-related disabled uniformed \nservices retiree under subsection (a) for any month.\u201d \n10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1413a(b)(1). The CRSC statute thus pro-\nvides the framework for the Secretary of each military \nbranch to determine which veterans are eligible, and \n \n2 \u201cSecretary concerned\u201d is defined to mean the Secretary of the \nArmy, Navy, Air Force, or Homeland Security, depending on \nwhich branch of the armed forces is concerned. 10 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 101(a)(9). \n\n8 \n \nhow much CRSC is due to a particular eligible veteran, \nbased on the criteria and classifications provided in \nthe statute. \nCRSC is not automatic. Eligible retirees must apply \nfor the special compensation through the military \nbranch from which they retired, and must document \nthat they meet eligibility criteria. In particular, an ap-\nplicant must document not only that they have a disa-\nbility rating of 10 percent or greater, but also that their \ndisability stems from one of the qualifying  situations \nthat are classified as \u201ccombat-related.\u201d See 10 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1413a(c), (e);  JA 87\u201390 (Guidance, Federal Circuit \nDeferred Appendix \u201cAppx.\u201d 101\u201303). For example, if a \nveteran claims entitlement to CRSC based on disabil-\nity due to an injury for which the veteran was awarded \nthe Purple Heart, the veteran must provide \u201cdocumen-\ntary information that there is a sufficient causal rela-\ntionship between the disability and the injury for \nwhich a Purple Heart was awarded to conclude that \nthe disability is attributable to such injury.\u201d JA 87 \n(Guidance, Appx. 101).3 Disabilities that a veteran \n \n3 As examples of the documentation required, the Army\u2019s web-\nsite on \u201cCRSC Frequently Asked Questions\u201d states:  \nSend to CRSC copies of DD 214/215s, as well as All VA-rating \ndecisions including the VA letter, the VA rating decisions and \nthe VA code sheets, Medical Records from MTF or VA physi-\ncians only, unless referred to a private physician by the VA, \nother typical official documents include, service medical rec-\nord extracts, military personnel file extracts, milita\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n18: 20250303172213953_COC20Soto20Final.json (score: 0.311)\nRULE 33.1(h) CERTIFICATE OF COMPLIANCE \nNo. 24-320 \nSIMON A.

Soto, \nand the class members he represents, are entitled to \nCombat-Related Special Compensation (\u201cCRSC\u201d)\u2014a \nmonthly benefit that Congress specifically authorized \nfor veterans who are disabled as a result of combat-\nrelated injuries incurred while serving in the United \nStates military. There is also no question that Cor-\nporal Soto is entitled to CRSC payments both going \nforward from the time his application was received and \nretroactively. The only question before this Court is \nwhether Corporal Soto may receive CRSC payments \nfor every month during which he was eligible under \nthe statute that authorizes CRSC, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1413a. \nThe government said no, contending that with respect \nto retroactive payments, Corporal Soto may obtain \nCRSC only for the six years before he applied. \nAlthough the CRSC statute imposes no time limit for \na veteran to apply for CRSC payments, the govern-\nment contends that the availability of CRSC payments \nis limited by a different statute, the Barring Act, 37 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 3702. The Barring Act is a gap-filling statute, \nauthorizing various agencies to \u201csettle\u201d an administra-\ntive claim against the United States\u2014i.e., to adminis-\ntratively determine whether the claim is valid and the \namount due\u2014in the event that no \u201c[]other law\u201d author-\nizes settlement of the claim. Id. \u00a7 3702(a). If a claim is \nsettled under the Barring Act, then it is subject to the \nBarring Act\u2019s six-year statute of limitations. Id. \n\u00a7 3702(b). But the Barring Act has no application to \nclaims for CRSC, because the CRSC statute authorizes \nsettlement of such claims. \nSpecifically, the CRSC statute authorizes the Secre-\ntaries of the military departments to determine both \nthe validity of claims for CRSC and the amount owed \n\n2 \n \nto eligible veterans\u2014all that is entailed in claims set-\ntlement. The Secretary concerned is directed to con-\nsider a veteran\u2019s application for CRSC under CRSC-\nspecific \u201cprocedures and criteria\u201d prescribed by the De-\npartment of Defense\u2014and thereby determine whether \nthe veteran is eligible for (and thus has a valid claim \nto) CRSC. 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1413a(d). The Secretary con-\ncerned is further directed to \u201cdetermine[]\u201d the monthly \namount owed to an eligible veteran using the process \nset forth in subsection (b). Id. \u00a7 1413a(a), (b). Because \nthe CRSC statute authorizes the Secretary concerned \nto determine the validity of a claim to CRSC and the \namount due, that statute specifically authorizes settle-\nment of claims like Corporal Soto\u2019s to CRSC\u2014and the \ngap-filling Barring Act accordingly has no application. \nThe judgment below should be reversed. \nDECISIONS BELOW  \nThe opinion of the Federal Circuit is reported at Soto \nv. United States, 92 F.4th 1094 (Fed. Cir. 2024), and \nreproduced at Pet. App. 1a\u201319a.

App. 45a.  \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nA. \nCombat-Related Special Compensation \n1. On December 2, 2002, Congress enacted the CRSC \nstatute to recognize and additionally compensate a se-\nlect and particularly deserving group of uniformed ser-\nvices retirees. The CRSC statute is unique in both \nwhom it serves and how it operates. In most cases, \nCongress prohibits simultaneous receipt of military re-\ntirement pay and Department of Veterans Affairs \n(\u201cVA\u201d) benefits. Congress first barred concurrent re-\nceipt of both military retirement pay and veteran\u2019s dis-\nability pension in 1891. Congressional Research Ser-\nvice, Concurrent Receipt of Military Retired Pay and \nVeteran Disability: Background and Issues for Con-\ngress (June 22, 2023), available at https://crsre-\nports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R40589/18 at 5. That \nprohibition remained in place until 1944, when Con-\ngress eased the prohibition by allowing retired mili-\ntary personnel to waive part of their retirement pay to \nreceive veteran\u2019s disability compensation. Act of May \n27, 1944, ch. 209, 58 Stat. 230, 230\u201331. This change \nwas modest, allowing some retirees to draw at least a \npartial disability benefit, which is nontaxable. Id.; 26 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 104(a)(4) & (b)(2)(D). But still, the law prohib-\nited concurrent receipt of both benefit types because it \nrequired any moneys received from veteran\u2019s disability \n\n4 \n \ncompensation to be subtracted from any retirement \nfunds received. Act of May 27, 1944, ch. 209, 58 Stat. \n230, 230\u201331. Hoping for better, veterans and advocacy \ngroups pushed for a change in law to allow receipt of \nall or some of both payments. \nIn 1999, Congress partially heeded that call. The \n1999 statute, Special Compensation for Severely Disa-\nbled Military Retirees, relaxed the prohibition on du-\nplicate benefits (also called concurrent receipt) by al-\nlowing veterans with at least 20 years of military ser-\nvice and a VA service-connected disability rated at 70 \npercent or higher to receive some monthly retirement \nbenefit. See Nat\u2019l Def. Authorization Act for Fiscal \nYear 2000, Pub. L. No. 106-65, \u00a7 658(a)(1), 113 Stat. \n512, 668\u201369 (1999). While this statute represented \nprogress, both the number of persons eligible and the \namount of compensation were minimal: the monthly \nbenefit maxed out at $300 and was available only to \nthe most severely disabled veterans. Id. \nCongress\u2019s enactment of the CRSC statute a few \nyears later represented a sea change. The program in-\ntroduced a higher cash benefit, closer to what concur-\nrent receipt would provide. However, in implementing \nthis change, Congress still saw fit to limit the benefit \nto a select group of military retirees whose service \nwrought some of the greatest sacrifices.1  \nA provision of the Bob Stump National Defense Au-\nthorization Act of 2003, the CRSC statute authorized \n \n1 Congress also enacted Concurrent Retirement and Disability \nPay (\u201cCRDP\u201d) in 2004, which allows longevity military retirees to \nreceive both military retired pay and VA disability compensation. \nNat\u2019l Def. Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2004, Pub. L. No. 108-\n136, \u00a7 641(a), 117 Stat. 1392, 1511\u201314 (2003). A veteran cannot \nreceive both CRSC and CRDP; if a veteran qualifies for both pay-\nments, the default payment will be the higher of the two.  \n\n5 \n \ncompensation to military retirees who either (1) sus-\ntained a disability that is \u201cattributable to an injury for \nwhich the member was awarded the Purple Heart\u201d and \nis assigned at least a 10% disability rating by the VA; \nor (2) had a disability rated at least 60% by the VA re-\nsulting from involvement in armed conflict, hazardous \nservice, duty simulating war, or through an instru-\nmentality of war. Bob Stump Nat\u2019l Def. Authorization \nAct for Fiscal Year 2003, Pub. L. No. 107-314, \u00a7 636, \n116 Stat. 2458, 2574\u201376 (2002) (codified as amended \nat 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1413a(e)). Since its inception, Congress \nhas amended and expanded the CRSC statute to pro-\nvide benefits to thousands of additional veterans with \ncombat-related disabilities.  \nAt first, the statute limited eligibility for CRSC to \nlongevity retirees (those who completed at least \ntwenty years of service). Pub. L. No. 107-314, \u00a7 636; 10 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 1413a(c)(1). The 2004 NDAA removed the \n60% disability rating threshold for longevity retirees. \nPub. L. No. 108-136, \u00a7 642. The 2008 NDAA further \nexpanded CRSC eligibility to anyone medically re-\ntired, including retirees with fewer than twenty years \nof service, effective January 1, 2008. Nat\u2019l Def. Author-\nization Act for Fiscal Year 2008, Pub. L. No. 110-181, \n122 Stat. 3 (2008).  \nTo be clear, the CRSC statute does not end the re-\nquirement that a retiree\u2019s military retired pay be re-\nduced by the amount of their total VA disability com-\npensation. 38 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5304, 5305. Instead, CRSC \nbeneficiaries receive \u201cspecial compensation\u201d: a partic-\nular, Congressionally authorized payment to select re-\ntirees that is in addition to whatever amount the vet-\neran is authorized to receive in military retirement \nand VA disability compensation. In contrast, a medical \nretiree who sustained a service-connected but non-\ncombat-related injury would not be eligible for such \n\n6 \n \nspecial compensation. Additionally, unlike some other \nmilitary or VA benefits, CRSC is available only to the \nveteran from the time the veteran becomes eligible to \nthe end of the veteran\u2019s life\u2014it does not extend to sur-\nviving spouses or other heirs. See 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1413a(a), \n(c).  \nThe CRSC statute stands apart as the first and only \nform of compensation that distinguishes veterans \nwounded as a result of combat. Neither VA service-\nconnected disability compensation nor longevity re-\ntirement nor medical retirement requires the veteran \nbeneficiary to suffer injury related to combat. See, e.g., \n38 U.S.C. \u00a7 1110 (VA basic entitlement\u2014time of war); \n38 U.S.C. \u00a7 1131 (VA basic entitlement\u2014peacetime); \n10 U.S.C. \u00a7 633 (longevity retirement for certain offic-\ners not recommended for promotion with 28 years of \nactive commissioned service); 10 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7  1201\u20131204 \n(military medical retirement); 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1293 (lon-\ngevity retirement for warrant officers with 20 years of \nservice); 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 12731 (reservist longevity retire-\nment). As such, the statute carves out unique benefits \nto a tailored group of retired service members whom \nlegislators singled out as particularly deserving. See \n148 Cong. Rec. S10,859 (daily ed. Nov. 13, 2002) (state-\nment of Sen. Harry Reid) (stating that the injured vet-\nerans aided by CRSC \u201cdeserve it as much as anyone \ndeserves anything in the world\u201d); id. at S10,860 (state-\nment of Sen. John Warner) (CRSC is \u201ccompensation \nfor those veterans we deemed formed that category de-\nserving of added funds\u201d). \n2. The CRSC statute provides: \u201cThe Secretary con-\ncerned shall pay to each eligible combat-related disa-\nbled uniformed services retiree who elects benefits un-\nder this section a monthly amount for the combat-re-\nlated disability of the retiree determined under \n\n7 \n \nsubsection (b).\u201d 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1413a(a).2 The statute goes \non to define how the Secretary concerned is to deter-\nmine which applicants for CRSC are eligible and how \nmuch each eligible applicant is to be paid. \nThe statutory term \u201celigible combat-related disabled \nuniformed services retiree\u201d is defined in subsection (c) \nto mean a service member who both is entitled to re-\ntired pay and has a \u201ccombat-related disability.\u201d The \nterm \u201ccombat-related disability\u201d is defined in subsec-\ntion (e) to mean a disability that is attributable to an \ninjury for which the member was awarded the Purple \nHeart or that was incurred in armed conflict, through \nan instrumentality of war, under conditions simulat-\ning war or other hazardous activity. Whether an appli-\ncant is eligible under the statutory definitions is to be \n\u201cconsidered\u201d by the Secretary concerned according to \n\u201cprocedures and criteria\u201d that the Secretary of Defense \nhas prescribed. Id. \u00a7 1413a(d); see also Joint Appendix \n(\u201cJA\u201d) 77\u2013107 (January 2004 Guidance promulgated \nby the Department of Defense pursuant to subsection \n(d));  JA 108\u2013113 (January 2008 Supplemental Guid-\nance promulgated by Department of Defense pursuant \nto subsection (d)). \nThe amount to be paid to eligible applicants is set \nforth in subsection (b) of the statute. That provision \ndetails how to determine \u201cthe monthly amount to be \npaid an eligible combat-related disabled uniformed \nservices retiree under subsection (a) for any month.\u201d \n10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1413a(b)(1). The CRSC statute thus pro-\nvides the framework for the Secretary of each military \nbranch to determine which veterans are eligible, and \n \n2 \u201cSecretary concerned\u201d is defined to mean the Secretary of the \nArmy, Navy, Air Force, or Homeland Security, depending on \nwhich branch of the armed forces is concerned. 10 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 101(a)(9). \n\n8 \n \nhow much CRSC is due to a particular eligible veteran, \nbased on the criteria and classifications provided in \nthe statute. \nCRSC is not automatic. Eligible retirees must apply \nfor the special compensation through the military \nbranch from which they retired, and must document \nthat they meet eligibility criteria. In particular, an ap-\nplicant must document not only that they have a disa-\nbility rating of 10 percent or greater, but also that their \ndisability stems from one of the qualifying  situations \nthat are classified as \u201ccombat-related.\u201d See 10 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1413a(c), (e);  JA 87\u201390 (Guidance, Federal Circuit \nDeferred Appendix \u201cAppx.\u201d 101\u201303). For example, if a \nveteran claims entitlement to CRSC based on disabil-\nity due to an injury for which the veteran was awarded \nthe Purple Heart, the veteran must provide \u201cdocumen-\ntary information that there is a sufficient causal rela-\ntionship between the disability and the injury for \nwhich a Purple Heart was awarded to conclude that \nthe disability is attributable to such injury.\u201d JA 87 \n(Guidance, Appx. 101).3 Disabilities that a veteran \n \n3 As examples of the documentation required, the Army\u2019s web-\nsite on \u201cCRSC Frequently Asked Questions\u201d states:  \nSend to CRSC copies of DD 214/215s, as well as All VA-rating \ndecisions including the VA letter, the VA rating decisions and \nthe VA code sheets, Medical Records from MTF or VA physi-\ncians only, unless referred to a private physician by the VA, \nother typical official documents include, service medical rec-\nord extracts, military personnel file extracts, military person-\nnel data system printouts, prior military disability board de-\ncisions, line of duty determinations, safety mishap (accident) \nreports, next of kin notification (Western Union Telegrams), \ncasualty reports, morning reports, duty status reports, or-\nder/travel voucher, official documents not in the military per-\nsonnel record, etc. Be sure to retain a copy for Soldier's rec-\nords. \nU.S. Army Hum.

Soto served honorably in the \nUnited States Marine Corps from 2000 to 2006. Pet. \nApp. 22a. During that time, he served two tours of ac-\ntive combat duty in Operation Iraqi Freedom. JA 15 \n\u00b6 53. During his first tour, Corporal Soto\u2019s unit served \nin Mortuary Affairs. Id. \u00b6 54. Mortuary Affairs opera-\ntions oversee the collection and dignified transfer of \nthe remains of fallen soldiers. Those serving in an \noverseas Mortuary Affairs unit, as Corporal Soto did, \nare responsible for entering into combat zones to re-\ntrieve their fallen comrades, identifying them, and \npreparing them for reunification with their surviving \nloved ones.

Members of the unit place \ntheir own bodies in harm\u2019s way to ensure that no sol-\ndier, living or deceased, is left behind on the battle-\nfield. As such, service in a Mortuary Affairs unit is \nsimultaneously physically dangerous and emotionally \ntaxing. Studies show that mortuary affairs personnel \nexperience some of the highest rates of Post-Traumatic \nStress Disorder (\u201cPTSD\u201d) in the service, due to the \ngruesome nature of the assignment, the emotional link \nbetween the soldier and the fallen, and the persistent \nphysical threats endured by the member of the unit. \nMichael Sledge, Soldier Dead: How We Recover, Iden-\ntify, Bury, and Honor Our Military Fallen 61 (2005), \nhttps://www.jstor.org/stable/10.7312/sled13514.6.  \nCorporal Soto\u2019s experience reflects this. While de-\nployed, Corporal Soto witnessed daily atrocities as he \nwent out to \u201csearch for, recover, and process the re-\nmains\u201d of war casualties. JA 15 \u00b6 54. Whenever his \nMortuary Affairs unit received a report of casualties, \nmembers of the unit would go out and place any recov-\nered remains in plastic or body bags and transport \nthem to the military base for identification and reloca-\ntion to the United States. Id. Corporal Soto recalls one \nmission in which he and other service members re-\ntrieved \u201cover 300 pieces of five or seven soldiers\u201d who \nhad been killed. Id. at 15\u201316 \u00b6 55. As Corporal Soto \nrelated,  \u201cit wasn\u2019t really easy to identify who and it \nwas just literally chunks and pieces of flesh that we \nwere processing.\u201d Id.  \nWhile serving, Corporal Soto began having suicidal \nthoughts, vivid nightmares, and difficulty concentrat-\ning as a result of his experiences in Mortuary Affairs. \nJA 16 \u00b6 56. After deployment, Corporal Soto found ad-\njustment to civilian life incredibly difficult. Id. His \nphysicians documented the correlation between his \n\n11 \n \ndistressing combat experiences in Iraq and his later \ndiagnosis of PTSD. Id. \u00b6 57. \nBecause Corporal Soto\u2019s PTSD rendered him \u201cunfit\u201d \nto continue his service, he was placed on the Tempo-\nrary Disability Retirement List (\u201cTDRL\u201d), and medi-\ncally retired from the Marine Corps on April 28, 2006. \nPet. App. 22a. This entitled him to military retirement \npay. Id. In recognition of his honorable service, the mil-\nitary awarded Corporal Soto numerous medals and \ncommendations, including the Army Commendation \nMedal, which is awarded to members of the Armed \nForces who \u201cdistinguish themselves by heroism, out-\nstanding achievement, or meritorious service\u201d; the \nNavy \nand \nMarine \nCorps \nAchievement \nMedal, \n\u201cawarded for meritorious service or achievement in ei-\nther combat or noncombat based on sustained perfor-\nmance or specific achievement of a superlative na-\nture;\u201d the Iraqi Campaign Medal, and the Global War \non Terrorism Service Medal.

Subsequently, Corporal Soto was removed \nfrom the TDRL and given permanent disability retire-\nment, which continued his entitlement to military re-\ntirement pay. Id. at 16 \u00b6 58.  \nCorporal Soto then sought service-connected disabil-\nity benefits from the VA for his PTSD. Id. \u00b6 59. In June \n2009, the VA issued a rating decision awarding him a \ndisability rating of 50 percent for his PTSD (effective \nApril 26, 2006), followed by a rating of 30 percent (ef-\nfective November 1, 2006), and then a rating of 100 \npercent (effective December 31, 2008). Id. A rating of \n100 percent means the VA concluded Corporal Soto \n\n12 \n \nexhibited \u201cTotal occupational and social impairment \ndue to such symptoms as: gross impairment in thought \nprocesses or communication; persistent delusions or \nhallucinations; grossly inappropriate behavior; persis-\ntent danger of hurting self or others; intermittent ina-\nbility to perform activities of daily living (including \nmaintenance of minimal personal hygiene); disorien-\ntation to time or place; memory loss for names of close \nrelatives, own occupation, or own name.\u201d  38 C.F.R. \u00a7 \n4.130 (General Rating Formula for Mental Disorders, \nDC 9411 (PTSD)). \nAgainst this backdrop of devastating symptoms, in \nJune 2016, Corporal Soto petitioned the Navy seeking \nCRSC based on his combat-related PTSD. Pet. App. \n22a. In October 2016, the Navy affirmed that Corporal \nSoto was eligible, finding that his PTSD was a combat-\nrelated disability and awarding him CRSC. Id. How-\never, the Navy assigned a CRSC effective date of July \n2010, Pet. App. 4a, notwithstanding the fact that Cor-\nporal Soto met all of the CRSC eligibility criteria as of \nJanuary 1, 2008\u2014the effective date of the 2008 NDAA, \nwhich as explained above, had extended CRSC to med-\nical retirees such as Corporal Soto. JA 17 \u00b6 61. See 10 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 1413a(b)(3)(B). As a result, the Secretary of \nthe Navy awarded him only six years of retroactive \nCRSC (from July 2010 to June 2016), not eight-and-\none-half years of retroactive CRSC (from January \n2008 until June 2016). JA 17 \u00b6\u00b6 61\u201362.  \nThe Secretary of the Navy explained its restriction \nof Corporal Soto\u2019s payment as follows:  \nCRSC is subject to the 6-year statute of \nlimitations United States Code (U.S.C.) \n31, Section 3702(b). In order to receive \nthe full retroactive CRSC entitlement, \nyou must file your CRSC claim within 6 \nyears of any VA rating decision that could \n\n13 \n \npotentially make you eligible for CRSC or \nthe date you became entitled to retired \npay, whichever is most recent. If you file \nyour claim more than 6 years after initial \neligibility, you will be restricted to 6 \nyears of any retroactive entitlement.  \nJA 11 \u00b6 35 (brackets in original). Through the Secre-\ntaries of the military branches, the United States has \nused this six-year statute of limitations policy to pay \nno more than six years of retroactive CRSC to thou-\nsands of other United States military combat veterans \nentitled to CRSC.  \nC. \nThe proceedings below \nOn March 2, 2017, Corporal Soto brought this action \nin the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of \nTexas on behalf of a class of U.S. military veterans \nwho, like him, are eligible for CRSC due to significant \ndisabilities they incurred through combat injuries. The \nsuit asserted a single claim pursuant to 10 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1413a (referred to above as the \u201cCRSC statute\u201d) \nbased on the United States\u2019 \u201cnationwide and unlawful \npolicy to pay no more than six years of retroactive \nCRSC \u201d JA 1. The proposed nationwide class consisted \nof:  \n[f]ormer service members of the \nUnited States Army, Navy, Marine \nCorps, Air Force, or Coast Guard \nwhose CRSC applications under 10 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 1413a were granted, but \nwhose amount of CRSC payment was \nlimited by Defendant\u2019s application of \nthe statute of limitations contained in \n31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3702 and have a claim \nless than $10,000. \n\n14 \n \nPet.

For J. on the \nPleadings, No. 1:17-cv-00051 (S.D. Tex. Aug. 31, 2017), \nDkt. 39. The court first recognized that \u201c[e]ntitlement \nto CRSC is set forth by statute in 10 U.S.C. \u00a71413a, \nwhich grants the Secretary concerned the authority to \npay an \u2018eligible combat-related disabled uniformed ser-\nvices retiree\u2019 a monthly amount of benefits for the com-\nbat-related disability.\u201d Id. at 5. It then reasoned, \u201c[t]he \nCourt is aware of no legal basis to conclude that Con-\ngress intended any other statute to govern CRSC \nclaims.\u201d Id. In particular, the Barring Act could not su-\npersede the mechanism for awarding CRSC within the \nCRSC statute. While the Barring Act is \u201ca \u2018general act\u2019 \napplicable to a multitude of uniformed service mem-\nbers\u2019 claims,\u201d the CRSC statute is a \u201c\u2018specific act\u2019 stat-\nute,\u201d the detailed provisions of which \u201ctake[] prece-\ndence over\u201d the Barring Act. Id.  \nThe District Court later certified the proposed class \non February 11, 2019. Pet. App. 31a. The government \nidentified 9,108 former service members whose retro-\nactive CRSC had been limited by application of the \nBarring Act.4 JA 71. \nThe District Court granted summary judgment to \nCorporal Soto on December 16, 2021. Pet. App. 38a\u2013\n39a. The court held that the CRSC statute separately \nauthorizes settlement of claims for CRSC \u201cbecause it \ndefines eligibility for CRSC, helps explain the amount \nof benefits and instructs the Secretary of Defense to \n \n4 The number of class members described above is based on in-\nformation provided by the government pulled from the list of \nCRSC recipients as of August 5, 2019.

App. 35a\u201336a. Accordingly, the \ncourt held that the CRSC statute is \u201canother law,\u201d dis-\nplacing the Barring Act and its six-year statute of lim-\nitations. Pet. App. 35a. The court entered final judg-\nment in favor of Corporal Soto and the class, finding \nthe government liable to the veterans for compensa-\ntion withheld when applying the Barring Act. Pet. \nApp. 38a\u201339a.  \nOn appeal, the Federal Circuit reversed the District \nCourt in a split decision. Pet. App. 11a. The majority \nheld that the Barring Act was not displaced\u2014and that \nits statute of limitations applied to limit the CRSC \navailable to Corporal Soto and the class\u2014based on its \nconclusion that the CRSC statute \u201cconveys no\u201d settle-\nment authority. Id. at 7a. According to the Federal Cir-\ncuit, in order to displace the Barring Act a statute \n\u201cmust explicitly grant an agency or entity the author-\nity to settle claims\u201d using \u201cspecific language,\u201d which \nthe majority stated \u201cwill typically be done by the use \nof the term \u2018settle\u2019.\u201d Id. at 6a\u20137a. Because the CRSC \nstatute does not \u201cmention[] settlement,\u201d the Federal \nCircuit concluded that \u201cit only establishes who may be \neligible for CRSC payments, not how claimants can \nhave those claims settled.\u201d Id.  \nThe majority separately held that \u201c[w]ithout specific \nlanguage authorizing the Secretary of Defense to settle \na claim[,] . . . the CRSC statute cannot displace the \nBarring Act, unless another statute provides a \u2018spe-\ncific\u2019 provision setting out the period of recovery.\u201d Pet. \nApp. 7a. The majority concluded that \u201cthe CRSC stat-\nute does not meet either of those requirements.\u201d Id.  \nJudge Reyna dissented. Pet. App. 12a. First, he ex-\nplained, \u201cthere is no dispute in this case\u201d that \u201c\u2018[s]et-\ntling a claim\u2019 . . . means administratively determining \nthe validity of the demand for money against the \n\n16 \n \ngovernment and the amount of money due.\u201d Id. at 12a\u2013\n13a. Here, he wrote, \u201cthe CRSC statute permits the \ngovernment to administratively determine the validity \nof a veteran\u2019s demand for CRSC, as well as the amount \nof CRSC due to the veteran in retroactive and future \nmonthly compensation. In light of these provisions, the \nBarring Act does not apply.\u201d Id. at 13a\u201314a.  \nIn particular, the statute \u201cdefines eligible retirees,\u201d \nthus allowing for the determination of \u201cwhether they \nhave a right to demand money under the statute\u2014that \nis, whether they have a \u2018claim.\u2019\u201d Pet. App. 14a. Fur-\nther, \u201cthe CRSC statute describes how the Secretary \nmust determine the \u2018monthly amount to be paid.\u2019\u201d Id. \nat 15a (quoting 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1413a(b)(1)). \u201cBy these \ncommon and plain terms, the CRSC statute specifies \nthe \u2018settlement\u2019 of a \u2018claim\u2019 against the government. It \ntherefore takes precedence over the Barring Act.\u201d Id. \nat 15a\u201316a. \nJudge Reyna went on to criticize the majority\u2019s de-\nmand for \u201c\u2018specific language\u2019\u201d before a statute could be \nread to authorize claims settlement as \u201cunprece-\ndented\u201d: \n[T]he long-understood meaning of \u201csettling\u201d a \n\u201cclaim\u201d against the government includes no such \nlimitations. Raising these new requirements, the \nmajority also raises the bar to a new and unprec-\nedented standard for what a statute must state to \nsupersede the Barring Act. Although a statute in-\nvolving resolution of conflict may \u201ctypically\u201d use \nthe words \u201csettle\u201d and \u201cclaim,\u201d the majority does \nnot explain why this phrasing should be \u201ctypical\u201d \nfor statutes that involve a more general, remedial, \nadministrative determination of eligibility for \nmoney from the government and the amount due. \nAnd the majority\u2019s alternative requirement\u2014that \na statute state a \u201cspecific\u201d period of recovery\u2014\n\n17 \n \nrequires a level of specificity in statutory lan-\nguage that finds no support in our canons of stat-\nutory interpretation.    \nPet. App. 18a.  \n\u201c[I]n rendering this decision,\u201d Judge Reyna wrote, \n\u201cthe majority denies benefits to a highly-deserving \nclass of veterans seeking compensation granted by \nstatute for combat-related injuries incurred in service \nto this country.\u201d Pet. App. 19a. \nSUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT  \nBefore an administrative claim for compensation \nfrom the United States may be paid, the claim must be \n\u201csettled.\u201d This Court has long held, and the parties \nagree, that to \u201csettle\u201d a claim in this context means to \nadministratively determine whether the claim is valid \nand how much is owed. As the entity with ultimate \ncontrol over use of U.S. funds, Congress determines \nwhich agency within the U.S. government has author-\nity to settle which claims.  \nIn the founding era, when far fewer administrative \nclaims were pursued against the United States, Con-\ngress lodged settlement authority exclusively with the \nTreasury Department. But in the subsequent two cen-\nturies, as the number of statutes authorizing ad-min-\nistrative claims against the government has prolifer-\nated, settlement authority has been broadly delegated, \nwith numerous agencies deemed authorized to settle \nvarious claims. In addition, Congress has enacted the \nBarring Act to act as a gap-filler: If a claim is pre-\nsented and no other statute authorizes a specific \nagency to settle it, then the Barring Act kicks in by \ndefault, and details which agency should settle which \ntype of claim.  \n\n18 \n \nThe question before the Court is whether the statute \ndirecting the Secretaries of the military branches to \npay CRSC to eligible veterans authorizes settlement of \nCRSC claims\u2014or, in the alternative, whether such \nclaims are subject to the Barring Act (and its six-year \nstatute of limitations) by default. The text of the CRSC \nmakes the answer plain. That statute on its face au-\nthorizes the Secretary concerned to determine \nwhether a veteran is eligible for (and thus has a valid \nclaim to) CRSC, and what amount of CRSC should be \npaid. The Barring Act has no application here. \nFirst, as to determining eligibility, the statute states \nthat \u201ca disabled uniformed services retiree may apply \nto the Secretary of a military department to be consid-\nered to be an eligible combat-related disabled uni-\nformed services retiree,\u201d with the Secretary\u2019s \u201cconsid-\neration\u201d of the application to be conducted according to \nCRSC-specific \u201cprocedures and criteria\u201d to be pre-\nscribed by the Secretary of Defense. 10 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1413a(d). Upon consideration of the claimant\u2019s appli-\ncation, the Secretary concerned is directed to \u201cpay\u201d \nCRSC \u201cto each eligible combat-related disabled uni-\nformed services retiree.\u201d Id. \u00a7 1413a(a). As to deter-\nmining the amount owed, the statute states that the \nSecretary concerned shall pay \u201ca monthly amount for \nthe combat-related disability of the retiree determined \nunder subsection (b).\u201d Id. Subsection (b), in turn, de-\ntails precisely how the Secretary is to make the requi-\nsite \u201cdetermination.\u201d Id. \u00a7 1413(b)(1) (titled \u201cdetermi-\nnation of monthly amount\u201d). \nIn short, the plain statutory text directs the Secre-\ntary concerned to determine both the validity of a vet-\neran\u2019s claim to CRSC and the amount owed. The CRSC \nstatute therefore confers settlement authority, and the \nBarring Act does not apply. \n\n19 \n \nThe Federal Circuit reached a different conclusion \nby applying a novel, anti-settlement canon of construc-\ntion. According to that court, a statute should not be \nconstrued to grant settlement authority unless it uses \n\u201cspecific language\u201d (\u201ctypically . . . the term \u2018settle,\u2019\u201d ac-\ncording to the Federal Circuit), or imposes an explicit \nstatute of limitations. Pet. App. 7a. Neither require-\nment holds water. \nFirst, statutory history and this Court\u2019s precedents \nconfirm that settlement authority exists whenever an \nagency has authority to administratively determine \nthe validity and amount of a claim, regardless of the \nparticular terms used. No authority supports the Fed-\neral Circuit\u2019s \u201cspecific language\u201d requirement\u2014and \nthis Court\u2019s case law teaches away from interpreting \nstatutes based on the presence or absence of \u201cmagic \nwords.\u201d To the extent any canon of construction was \napplied here, the Federal Circuit should have applied \nthe veterans canon\u2014which was widely accepted, and \npresumably known to Congress, at the time the CRSC \nstatute was enacted.  \nAdditionally, the statutory text squarely refutes the \nFederal Circuit\u2019s conclusion that (because it does not \nuse the word \u201csettle\u201d) the CRSC statute \u201conly estab-\nlishes who may be eligible for CRSC payments.\u201d Pet. \nApp. 7a. The statute on its face authorizes the Secre-\ntary concerned to determine eligibility and amount \ndue, and to pay CRSC claims\u2014distinguishing it from \nother military compensation statutes that, unlike the \nCRSC statute, address only an individual\u2019s entitle-\nment to pay, and not the Secretary\u2019s authority to settle \nclaims and make payment on them. \nFinally, the Federal Circuit\u2019s suggestion that the \nCRSC statute must impose a statute of limitations to \ndisplace the Barring Act is inconsistent with the text \nof the Barring Act. The text makes clear that the \n\n20 \n \nBarring Act\u2014all of it, including its statute of limita-\ntions\u2014does not apply to a claim if \u201canother law\u201d pro-\nvides for settlement, without regard to whether the \nother law also includes a statute of limitations. 31 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 3702(a)\u2013(b). Indeed, the absence of a statute \nof limitations on CRSC claims makes perfect sense \ngiven how the CRSC statute operates. CRSC becomes \navailable only after a veteran is retired from the mili-\ntary, and is awarded only during the veteran\u2019s life-\ntime, and not to the veteran\u2019s heirs. Further, interest \nis not available on retroactive CRSC payments. Given \nthese constraints\u2014and the obstacles that disabling \ncombat-related injuries may pose to a veteran\u2019s ability \nto complete the CRSC application process\u2014it is unsur-\nprising that Congress chose to make CRSC payments \navailable for the entire period of a veteran\u2019s eligibility. \nThe decision below should be reversed. \nARGUMENT  \nI. \nTHE CRSC STATUTE AUTHORIZES SET-\nTLEMENT OF CLAIMS FOR CRSC AND \nTHUS DISPLACES THE BARRING ACT. \nThe Federal Circuit held that claims for CRSC must \nbe settled under the Barring Act\u2014and are accordingly \nsubject to the Barring Act\u2019s six-year statute of limita-\ntions\u2014based on its conclusion that the CRSC statute \ndoes not authorize settlement of claims for CRSC. Pet. \nApp. 7a. The Federal Circuit was incorrect. Settlement \nauthority exists if a statute authorizes an agency to \nadministratively determine the validity of a claim and \nthe amount due. The CRSC statute authorizes the Sec-\nretaries of the military departments to administra-\ntively determine both whether an applicant is eligible \nfor (i.e., has a valid claim to) CRSC, and what amount \nof CRSC the applicant is entitled to. Because the \nCRSC statute authorizes settlement of CRSC claims, \n\n21 \n \nit is \u201canother law\u201d that displaces the Barring Act, see \n31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3702(a), and neither the Barring Act\u2019s set-\ntlement procedures nor its statute of limitations ap-\nplies to claims for CRSC. \nA. An agency has settlement authority if a \nstatute authorizes it to administratively \ndetermine the validity of a claim and the \namount due. \n1. Congress has widely authorized agen-\ncies to settle claims against the United \nStates. \nThe Constitution grants Congress exclusive author-\nity to \u201cpay the Debts\u201d of the United States, and to \u201cdis-\npose of and make all needful Rules and Regulations \nrespecting the Territory or other Property belonging to \nthe United States.\u201d U.S. Const. art. I, \u00a7 8, cl. 1; id. art. \nIV \u00a7 3, cl. 2. Further, \u201cNo Money shall be drawn from \nthe Treasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations \nmade by Law.\u201d Id., art. I, \u00a7 9, cl. 7. Accordingly, for a \nclaimant to obtain payment from the United States, \nCongress must have authorized both acceptance of the \nclaim and payment using appropriated funds. See, e.g., \nUnited States v. Corliss Steam-Engine Co., 91 U.S. \n321, 322 (1875) (power to settle and pay claims on be-\nhalf of the United States is \u201climited by the legislation \nof Congress\u201d); U.S. Gov\u2019t Accountability Off., GAO-08-\n978SP, Principles of Federal Appropriations Law 14-\n2\u201314-3 (3d ed. 2008) (\u201cGAO Red Book\u201d) (\u201c[C]laims \nagainst the United States may not be approved, \u2026 and \nappropriated funds (or other resources) may not be \nused to satisfy claims against the United States, un-\nless there is constitutional and/or statutory authority \nthat both allows the claim to be pursued and makes \nfunds (or other resources, available for that purpose.\u201d). \n\n22 \n \nThe first step in this process\u2014determining that a \nclaimant has a valid claim against the United States, \nand what amount is owed on such claim\u2014is often (but \nnot exclusively) referred to as \u201csettlement.\u201d \u201cThe word \n\u2018settlement,\u2019 in connection with public transactions \nand accounts, has been used from the beginning to de-\nscribe administrative determination of the amount \ndue.\u201d Ill. Sur. Co. v. United States, 240 U.S. 214, 219 \n(1916). Specifically, the authority \u201cto settle and adjust\u201d \na claim against the United States is the authority \u201cto \ndetermine upon the validity of\u201d the claim and the \namount owed on it. Id. at 219\u201320 (emphasis omitted) \n(quoting Cooke v. United States, 91 U.S. 389, 399 \n(1875)).5 And this Court has made clear that settlement \nof a claim is a distinct step that precedes payment of a \nclaim. See id. at 218\u201319 (statutory term \u201csettlement\u201d \nof claims could not be interpreted to \u201cdenote payment\u201d \nof claims); Cooke, 91 U.S. at 399\u2013400 (assistant-treas-\nurer was authorized to make payments using appro-\npriated funds, but had \u201cno authority to settle and ad-\njust, that is to say, to determine upon the validity of, \nany claim against the government\u201d).  \nNotably, the term \u201csettlement,\u201d when used to denote \nadministrative processing of a claim, does not have the \nsame meaning as when that term is used in litigation. \n\u201c[T]he term \u2018settlement\u2019 in the litigation context means \ncompromise.\u201d Off. of Gen. Counsel, GAO, Principles of \nFederal Appropriations Law 11-6 (1st ed. 1982). But \nthe authority to administratively  \nsettle and adjust claims does not . . . include the \n \n5 A \u201cclaim\u201d in this context is \u201ca right to demand money from the \nUnited States . . . which can be presented by the claimant to some \ndepartment or officer of the United States for payment, or may be \nprosecuted in the court of claims.\u201d Hobbs v. McLean, 117 U.S. 567, \n575 (1886). \n\n23 \n \nauthority to compromise claims. In the context of \npayment claims, the rationale for this is simply \nthat a claim determined to be valid should be paid \nin full. Likewise, public funds should not be used \nto pay any part of a claim determined not to be \nvalid. Thus, the authority to compromise a given \nclaim against the United States depends on the \nexistence of statutory authority above and beyond \nthe authority to \u201csettle and adjust\u201d claims of that \ntype. \nId. (citations omitted). This long-established use of the \nterm \u201csettlement\u201d\u2014to mean administrative determi-\nnation of the validity of a claim and amount due\u2014con-\ntinues to this day. See, e.g., Adams v. Hinchman, 154 \nF.3d 420, 422 (D.C. Cir. 1998) (per curiam) (citing Ill. \nSur. and holding: \u201cto settle a claim means to adminis-\ntratively determine the validity of that claim\u201d) (quot-\ning Off. of Gen. Counsel, GAO, Principles of Federal \nAppropriations Law 11-6); Paige v. United States, 159 \nFed. Cl. 383, 386 (2022); Devlin v. Berry, 26 F. Supp. \n3d 74, 79 (D.D.C. 2014). Relevant here, \u201cthere is no dis-\npute in this case regarding what it means to \u2018settle\u2019 \nsuch a claim.\u201d Pet. App. 12a (Reyna, J., dissenting); see \nalso Brief for Appellant at 29-30, Soto v. United States, \nNo. 2022\u20132011 (Fed. Cir. Oct. 12, 2022); Pet. App. 3a \nn.1. \nIn the earliest days of the republic, Congress re-\ntained authority to settle claims, and itself \u201cadjudi-\ncate[d] each individual money claim against the \nUnited States.\u201d Off. of Pers. Mgmt. v. Richmond, 496 \nU.S. 414, 430 (1990). As the nation grew and the need \nfor timely processing of claims increased following the \nRevolutionary War, Congress in 1789 established the \nTreasury Department, and granted it authority to \n\u201csettle\u201d and \u201caudit\u201d accounts on behalf of the United \nStates. An Act to Establish the Treasury Department, \n\n24 \n \nch. XII, 1 Stat. 65, 66\u201367 (1789). Shortly thereafter, in \n1817, Congress expanded this delegation, legislating \nthat \u201call claims and demands whatever, by the United \nStates or against them, and all accounts whatever, in \nwhich the United States are concerned, either as debt-\nors or as creditors, shall be settled and adjusted in the \nTreasury Department.\u201d An Act to Provide for the \nPrompt Settlement of Public Accounts, ch. XLV, \u00a7 2, 3 \nStat. 366, 366 \u00a7 2 (1817).   \nIn this early period, reviewing and paying claims \nagainst the United States was \u201cmuch simpler,\u201d be-\ncause Congress had not yet authorized many claims, \nand \u201cthe possibility of obtaining redress for claims \nagainst the government was limited.\u201d GAO Red Book \nat 14-20\u201314-21. In the subsequent two centuries, how-\never, \u201c[t]he law has undergone a sea change,\u201d with the \nnumber of statutes authorizing claims against the gov-\nernment proliferating. Id. at 14\u201321. \u201cNow, there are \nmany statutes that, in varying degrees of detail, waive \nsovereign immunity and bestow authority to adminis-\ntratively entertain claims.\u201d Id.  \nIndeed, unlike Congress\u2019s early legislation decreeing \nthat the Treasury Department should settle \u201call \nclaims,\u201d Congress has in subsequent years dispersed \nsettlement authority across the federal government. In \nthe U.S. Code, there are \u201cmany authorities available \ntoday to administratively settle claims against the fed-\neral government,\u201d by numerous federal agencies. Id.; \nid. (offering \u201ca brief sampler\u201d of statutes authorizing \nvarious agencies to settle claims). \nAnd Congress is not alone: judicial interpretation \nand agency practice have similarly spread settlement \nauthority more widely. For example, this Court, in \nCorliss Steam-Engine, concluded that the Secretary of \nthe Navy\u2019s statutory authority to enter into contracts \nto acquire naval machinery necessarily encompassed \n\n25 \n \nthe power to settle claims for payment under such con-\ntracts\u2014including claims for partial performance. \u201cAs, \nin making the original contracts, he must agree upon \nthe compensation to be made for their entire perfor-\nmance, it would seem, that, when those contracts are \nsuspended by him, he must be equally authorized to \nagree upon the compensation for their partial perfor-\nmance.\u201d 91 U.S., at 322\u201323. The Court reasoned, \u201cit \nwould be of serious detriment to the public service if \nthe power of the head of the Navy Department did not \nextend to providing for all such possible contingencies \nby modification or suspension of the contracts, and set-\ntlement with the contractors.\u201d Id. at 323. \nAdditionally, after Congress created the General Ac-\ncounting Office and by statute transferred to that \nagency the authority to settle claims of the United \nStates, Budget and Accounting Act of 1921, Pub. L. No. \n67-13, \u00a7 305, 42 Stat. 20, 24 (1921), the GAO adopted \nthe practice of delegating the settlement function to \nother agencies. Rather than settle claims itself, \n\u201cGAO\u2019s policy was to leave initial settlement of a claim \nto the agency from whose activities the claims arose.\u201d \n42 Stat. at 14\u201324; see also 4 C.F.R. \u00a7 31.4 (1998) (\u201cA \nclaimant should file his or her claim with the adminis-\ntrative department or agency out of whose activities \nthe claim arose. The agency shall initially adjudicate \nthe claim.\u201d).  \n2. The Barring Act confers nonexclu-\nsive settlement authority and is dis-\nplaced by any \u201c[]other law\u201d authoriz-\ning claims settlement. \nGiven this history, it is unsurprising that the cur-\nrent Barring Act\u2014a much-amended statutory de-\nscendant of the 1817 law directing the Treasury to set-\ntle all claims, GAO Red Book at 14-5 n.28\u2014is explicit \nthat no agency has exclusive authority to settle claims \n\n26 \n \nagainst the United States. Instead, at this point in the \nnation\u2019s history, the Barring Act is no more than a \n\u201cgeneral background provision[]\u201d that is \u201cinapplicable\u201d \nwhere any other statute authorizes claims settlement. \nHernandez v. Dep\u2019t of Air Force, 498 F.3d 1328, 1332 \n(Fed. Cir. 2007). \nSpecifically, the Barring Act provides that, \u201c[e]xcept \nas provided in this chapter or another law, all claims \nof or against the United States Government shall be \nsettled as follows.\u201d 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3702(a) (emphasis \nadded). Subject to the \u201canother law\u201d carveout, the Bar-\nring Act then assigns settlement authority as to claims \ninvolving specified topics to the Secretary of Defense, \nthe Director of the Office of Personnel Management, \nand the Administrator of General Services, respec-\ntively, with the Director of the Office of Management \nand Budget assigned to \u201csettle claims not otherwise \nprovided for by this subsection or another provision of \nlaw.\u201d Id. \u00a7 3702(a)(1)\u2013(4).  \nCongress reiterated the nonexclusive nature of set-\ntlement authority in the legislation enacting the cur-\nrent version of the Barring Act. There, Congress ex-\nplained that the settlement function previously lodged \nwith the GAO would be transferred to the Director of \nOMB, but expressly provided that \u201c[t]he Director may \ndelegate any such function, in whole or in part, to any \nother agency or agencies if the Director determines \nthat such delegation would be cost-effective or other-\nwise in the public interest.\u201d Legislative Branch Appro-\npriations Act, Pub. L. No. 104-53, \u00a7 211, 109 Stat. 514, \n535 (1995). And, pursuant to this statutory authority,  \nOMB has delegated its residual settlement authority \nto various agencies, depending on the nature of the \nclaim. See Memorandum from Comptroller Gen., B-\n275605, Transfer of Claims Settlement and Related \n\n27 \n \nAdvance Decisions, Waivers, and Other Functions 1\u20132 \n(Mar. 17, 1997), https://perma.cc/89K2-DBKA. \nThe Barring Act also sets forth a time limit for \nclaims settled under that statute: \u201cA claim against the \nGovernment presented under this section . . .  must be \nreceived by the official responsible under subsection \n(a) for settling the claim or by the agency that conducts \nthe activity from which the claim arises within 6 years \nafter the claim accrues.\u201d 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3702(b)(1). As the \nprovision states expressly, this statute of limitations \napplies only to claims \u201cpresented under this section\u201d\u2014\ni.e., claims settled pursuant to the authority conferred \nin the Barring Act. Additionally, even for claims set-\ntled under the Barring Act, the six-year limit is dis-\nplaced if \u201canother law\u201d provides otherwise. Id. \n\u00a7 3702(b)(1)(A).  \nIn sum, under current law, any agency may settle a \nclaim against the United States if a statute authorizes \nthe agency to administratively determine the validity \nof the claim and the amount due on it. To the extent \nno other statute authorizes settlement of a particular \nclaim, the Barring Act acts as a gap-filler, supplying \ngeneral settlement authority to various agencies. \nWhen a claim is settled under the general authority \nconferred in the Barring Act, instead of under specific \nsettlement authority conferred in \u201canother law,\u201d the \nclaim is subject to the Barring Act\u2019s default six-year \nstatute of limitations. \nB. The CRSC statute confers authority to \nsettle and pay claims for CRSC. \nThe CRSC statute, on its face, grants authority to \nthe Secretaries of the military departments to settle \nclaims for CRSC. Because claims for CRSC are \nproperly settled under the specific settlement author-\nity granted in the CRSC statute, that statute \n\n28 \n \nconstitutes \u201canother law\u201d that displaces the Barring \nAct. Accordingly, the Barring Act\u2019s provisions\u2014includ-\ning the six-year statute of limitations in \u00a7 3702(b)\u2014do \nnot apply to CRSC claims. \n1. The CRSC statute authorizes the Sec-\nretary concerned to administratively \ndetermine the validity of a veteran\u2019s \nclaim for CRSC and the amount due. \nThe CSRC Statute begins as follows: \n(a) Authority.\u2014 \nThe Secretary concerned shall pay to each eligible \ncombat-related disabled uniformed services re-\ntiree who elects benefits under this section a \nmonthly amount for the combat-related disability \nof the retiree determined under subsection (b). \n10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1413a(a).  \nValidity. Subsection (a) grants the Secretary con-\ncerned \u201c[a]uthority\u201d to administratively determine the \nvalidity of a claim for CRSC, in that it directs the Sec-\nretary concerned to pay CSRC only to an \u201celigible com-\nbat-related disabled uniformed services retiree who \nelects benefits under this section.\u201d Id. (emphasis \nadded.) And the statute elsewhere confirms that it is \nthe Secretary concerned who is authorized to adminis-\ntratively determine the eligibility of an applicant elect-\ning CRSC benefits (and hence, a claim\u2019s validity). \nEligibility is defined in subsection (c). That section, \ntitled \u201cEligible retirees,\u201d provides that \u201c[f]or purposes \nof this section, an eligible combat-related disabled uni-\nformed services retiree referred to in subsection (a) is \na member of the uniformed services who\u2014(1) is enti-\ntled to retired pay . . .; and (2) has a combat-related \ndisability.\u201d Id. \u00a7 1413a(c) \u201cCombat-related disability\u201d \nis defined in subsection (e) to mean a disability \n\n29 \n \n\u201cattributable to an injury for which the member was \nawarded the Purple Heart\u201d or that was incurred \u201cas a \ndirect result of armed conflict,\u201d \u201cwhile engaged in haz-\nardous service,\u201d \u201cin the performance of duty under con-\nditions simulating war,\u201d or \u201cthrough an instrumental-\nity of war.\u201d  \nSubsection (d), in turn, provides that it is the Secre-\ntary concerned who must \u201cconsider[]\u201d whether an ap-\nplicant for CRSC is \u201can eligible combat-related disa-\nbled uniformed services retiree\u201d under these defini-\ntions and details how that consideration is to be con-\nducted. Id. \u00a7 1413a(d). In particular, subsection (d) \nstates that \u201c[t]he Secretary of Defense shall prescribe \nprocedures and criteria under which a disabled uni-\nformed services retiree may apply to the Secretary of \na military department[6] to be considered to be an eli-\ngible combat-related disabled uniformed services re-\ntiree.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Thus, Congress expressly di-\nrected that whether an applicant electing CRSC bene-\nfits is \u201can eligible combat-related disabled uniformed \nservices retiree\u201d\u2014i.e., whether an applicant has a \nvalid claim to CRSC benefits\u2014is a matter to be \u201ccon-\nsidered\u201d by the Secretary concerned, according to \nCRSC-specific procedures to be established by the De-\npartment of Defense. In short, by directing the Secre-\ntary concerned to \u201cconsider\u201d whether an applicant is \neligible for CRSC benefits\u2014and to pay CRSC only to \neligible applicants\u2014the statute\u2019s plain text authorizes \nthe Secretary concerned to administratively determine \n \n6 \u201cSecretary of a military department\u201d refers to the Secretary \nof the Army, Navy, or Air Force. See 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 101(a)(8) (defin-\ning \u201cmilitary departments\u201d). The Secretary of a military depart-\nment considering an individual applicant\u2019s eligibility will be the \nSecretary of the department from which the applicant retired. JA \n81, 92.  \n\n30 \n \nthe validity of each applicant\u2019s claim to CRSC pay-\nments. \nThis reading of the statutory text is echoed in the \nGuidance published by the Department of Defense un-\nder subsection (d). JA 77. That document makes clear \nthat\u2014as the statute provides\u2014\u201c[t]he Military Depart-\nments determine which applicants are entitled to \nCRSC.\u201d Id. At each step, the Guidance issued under \nthe statute reiterates that the administrative determi-\nnation of the validity of an applicant\u2019s claim is to be \nperformed by the relevant Military Department. Id. at \n80 (\u201cApplications for CRSC will be processed by the re-\nspective Military Department under these guide-\nlines.\u201d); id. at 87 (\u201c[T]he Military Departments will de-\ntermine whether the member\u2019s disabilities are qualify-\ning combat-related disabilities as prescribed below.\u201d); \nid. (\u201cA retiree is entitled to CRSC only if the Service \ndetermines that the member has Combat-Related Dis-\nabilities.\u201d); id. at 92 (\u201cEach Military Department will \nreceive and process CSRC applications submitted by \nmembers retired from that Military Department\u201d with \nan application to be approved \u201conly if the applicant \nsatisfies\u201d all CRSC eligibility criteria). \nThe Guidance accords with the statutory text: The \nSecretary concerned is authorized under the statute to \nadministratively determine whether an applicant is el-\nigible for CRSC, and thus has a valid claim for com-\npensation by the U.S. government.      \nAmount due. Subsection (a) also authorizes the Sec-\nretary concerned to administratively determine the \namount of CRSC owed on an eligible veteran\u2019s claim. \nSubsection (a) states that the Secretary concerned \nshall pay \u201ca monthly amount for the combat-related \ndisability of the retiree determined under subsection \n(b).\u201d 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1413a(a) (emphasis added). Under the \nplain text of subsection (a), therefore, \u201c[a]uthority\u201d is \n\n31 \n \nconferred on the Secretary concerned to \u201cdetermine[]\u201d \nthe monthly amount owed by applying subsection (b). \nSubsection (b) in turn \u201cprovides instructions on the \nadministrative calculation of the amount due to satisfy \nan eligible veteran\u2019s claim.\u201d Pet. App. 15a. Subsection \n(b)(1), titled \u201cDetermination of monthly amount,\u201d \nstates that \u201cthe monthly amount to be paid,\u201d subject to \nadditional conditions set forth in subsections (b)(2) and \n(b)(3), \u201cfor any month is the amount of compensation \nto which the retiree is entitled under title 38 for that \nmonth, determined without regard to the disability of \nthe retiree that is not a combat-related disability.\u201d \nSubsection (b)(2) puts a cap on the amount described \nin (b)(1), stating that the maximum amount of CRSC \nfor any month cannot exceed the amount of retired pay \nthat the veteran waived by electing to receive VA ben-\nefits. Id. \u00a7 1413a(b)(2) (citing 38 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5304, 5305). \nAnd subsection (b)(3) sets forth special rules for Chap-\nter 61 disability retirees,7 providing distinct, explicit \nformulae to follow when determining the amount due \ndepending on the veteran\u2019s situation. The effect of \nthese provisions is to \u201callow[] the veteran to maximize \nthe amount of compensation she would receive, includ-\ning as  a result of reductions in retired pay for a par-\nticular month.\u201d Pet. App. 15a (citing 10 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1413a(b)). In sum, the statute authorizes the Secre-\ntary to \u201cdetermine[]\u201d the amount due to an eligible vet-\neran\u2014and directs how to make that determination. \n \n7 10 U.S.C. ch. 61 governs retirement of service members who \nhave been determined to be unfit for duty due to disability. See \nDep\u2019t of Def., Military Compensation: Disability Retirement, \nhttps://tinyurl.com/ykyuek45 (last visited Feb. 28, 2025). \n\n32 \n \n2. The CRSC statute separately author-\nizes payment of CRSC. \nFinally, providing further confirmation that subsec-\ntion (a)\u2019s grant of \u201cauthority\u201d to the Secretary con-\ncerned confers settlement authority is that the statute \nseparately authorizes the payment of CRSC claims \nfrom specific appropriated funds. As noted above, set-\ntlement of claims and payment of claims are separate \nfunctions that must be separately authorized. See Ill. \nSur., 240 U.S. at 218\u201319 (statutory term \u201csettlement\u201d \nof claims could not be interpreted to \u201cdenote payment\u201d \nof claims); see also GAO Red Book at 14\u201329 (\u201cJust be-\ncause a claim is approved through the claims settle-\nment process does not necessarily mean that it can or \nwill be paid. For the claim to be paid, appropriated \nfunds must be available for that purpose.\u201d).  \nConsistent with this longstanding understanding, \nthe CRSC statute confers authority not only to settle \nclaims, as described above, but also to make payment \non settled claims using particular appropriated funds. \nSubsection (h) sets forth the \u201cSource of payments\u201d of \nCRSC: Payments to veterans of the Army, Navy, Air \nForce, Marine Corps, or Space Force \u201cshall be paid \nfrom the Department of Defense Military Retirement \nFund,\u201d while payments for any other member \u201cshall be \npaid out of funds appropriated for pay and allowances \npayable by the Secretary concerned for that fiscal \nyear.\u201d 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1413a(h). \nThis separate provision for payment of CRSC is tell-\ning. It is consistent with typical legislative practice to \nprovide for both settlement of claims and payment of \nclaims using appropriated funds in the same statute. \nIn the words of the GAO Red Book, \u201cWhen considering \nwhat appropriation to use to pay an administratively \nsettled claim, the first place to look is the statute au-\nthorizing the settlement.\u201d GAO Red Book at 14\u201345. \n\n33 \n \nWhere, as with the CRSC statute, a statute \u201cgoverning \nspecific types of claims contain[s] detailed provisions \ngoverning the payment of those claims,\u201d id. at 14\u201344, \nthen the statute establishes a self-contained compen-\nsation scheme\u2014here, providing for both administra-\ntive determination of the validity of CRSC claims and \namount due thereon, as well as the ultimate payment \nof settled claims. \n* * * * * \nBecause the CRSC statute authorizes the Secretary \nconcerned to administratively determine (a) whether \nan applicant is eligible for CRSC, and (b) how much \nCRSC the applicant is owed, the CRSC statute author-\nizes the Secretary concerned to settle claims for CRSC. \nThe CRSC statute is thus \u201canother law\u201d that displaces \nthe Barring Act. The Federal Circuit\u2019s contrary deci-\nsion was erroneous.  \nII. \nTHE TEST CREATED BY THE FEDERAL \nCIRCUIT IS INCORRECT AND SHOULD \nBE REJECTED.  \nThe Federal Circuit majority held that the Barring \nAct was not displaced\u2014and that its statute of limita-\ntions applied to limit the CRSC available to Corporal \nSoto and the class\u2014based on its conclusion that the \nCRSC statute \u201cconveys no\u201d settlement authority. Pet. \nApp. 7a. According to the Federal Circuit, in order to \ndisplace the Barring Act a statute \u201cmust explicitly \ngrant an agency or entity the authority to settle \nclaims\u201d using \u201cspecific language,\u201d which the majority \nstated \u201cwill typically be done by the use of the term \n\u2018settle.\u2019\u201d Id. at 6a\u20137a. Thus, rather than review the \nCRSC statute\u2019s provisions to determine whether it au-\nthorized claims settlement, the majority simply evalu-\nated whether the statute \u201cmention[s] settlement.\u201d Id. \nNot finding the word \u201csettle,\u201d the Federal Circuit \n\n34 \n \nconcluded that the CRSC statute \u201conly establishes who \nmay be eligible for CRSC payments, not how claimants \ncan have those claims settled.\u201d Id. The majority fur-\nther held that \u201c[w]ithout specific language,\u201d the CRSC \nstatute would need to \u201cprovide[] a \u2018specific\u2019 provision \nsetting out the period of recovery,\u201d a requirement the \nmajority said also was not satisfied. Id. \nThis two-part test disregards this Court\u2019s definition \nof \u201csettlement,\u201d imposes unjustified requirements on \nCongress, and otherwise lacks a basis in the law of \nstatutory interpretation. The Court should reject it. \nA. \nThere is no requirement that a statute use \nthe word \u201csettle\u201d to displace the Barring \nAct.  \n1. The Federal Circuit\u2019s \u201cspecific lan-\nguage\u201d requirement is inconsistent \nwith precedent. \nThe Federal Circuit\u2019s demand for \u201cspecial lan-\nguage\u201d addressing settlement finds no support in stat-\nutory history or case law. \nFirst, no authority supports the notion that the \nword \u201csettle\u201d must appear for a statute to confer set-\ntlement authority. While some statutes addressing \nclaims settlement use the term \u201csettle,\u201d others use dif-\nferent terms (such as \u201cadjust,\u201d \u201caudit,\u201d \u201cadjudicate,\u201d or \n\u201cdetermine\u201d) or confer authority to settle claims by au-\nthorizing conduct that encompasses claims settlement. \nThat is the upshot of this Court\u2019s decision in Corliss \nSteam-Engine. There, the Court acknowledged that \nthe power to settle claims \u201cis, of course, limited by the \nlegislation of Congress,\u201d but concluded that the Secre-\ntary of the Navy had legislative authority to settle a \nclaim for payment for partial performance on a manu-\nfacturing contract without regard to the presence or \n\n35 \n \nabsence of \u201cspecial language\u201d in the statute. 91 U.S. at \n322\u201323. Instead, the Court concluded that the requi-\nsite settlement authority existed because \u201cdischarge of \nthe duty devolving upon the secretary necessarily re-\nquires him to enter into numerous contracts,\u201d some of \nwhich would inevitably have to be suspended, and he \naccordingly was necessarily \u201cauthorized to agree upon \nthe compensation for their partial performance.\u201d Id. In \nshort, the Secretary\u2019s authority to settle claims was \nfound through a functional analysis of the authorities \ngranted to him in the statute\u2014not simply by asking \nwhether the statute \u201cmention[ed] settlement\u201d as the \nFederal Circuit majority did here. Pet. App. 7a.  \nSimilarly, in Hernandez, the Federal Circuit ad-\ndressed whether the Barring Act applied to settlement \nof claims brought under the Uniformed Services Em-\nployment and Reemployment Rights Act (\u201cUSERRA\u201d), \n38 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 4301\u20134333. 498 F.3d at 1330\u201331. The \nFederal Circuit concluded that settlement of claims \nunder USERRA is governed exclusively by 38 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 4324(c), which provides that \u201c[t]he Merit Systems \nProtection Board shall adjudicate any complaint.\u201d Ac-\ncording to the Federal Circuit, this language\u2014which \nrefers neither to \u201csettlement\u201d nor \u201cclaims\u201d\u2014was suffi-\ncient to displace the Barring Act. 480 F.3d at 1331.  \nAnd in McNeil v. United States, 78 Fed. Cl. 211 \n(2007), the Court of Federal Claims held that a series \nof statutes each could serve as \u201canother law\u201d providing \nthe Secretary of the Treasury with authority to settle \nclaims of or against the United States, displacing the \nBarring Act. Id. at 221. Among other things, the \nMcNeil court pointed to 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6402(a), which pro-\nvides that \u201c[i]n the case of any overpayment [of taxes], \nthe Secretary, within the applicable period of limita-\ntions, may credit the amount of such overpayment . . .  \nagainst any liability in respect of an internal revenue \n\n36 \n \ntax on the part of the person who made the overpay-\nment and shall . . .  refund any balance to such person.\u201d \nJust like the CRSC statute, \u00a7 6402(a) authorizes the \nSecretary to determine (a) whether a tax refund is \nowed (i.e., whether there is a valid claim) and (b) the \namount of such refund\u2014and then authorizes the Sec-\nretary to pay it. Thus, just like the CRSC statute, 26 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 6402(a) authorizes settlement of claims and \ndisplaces the Barring Act. McNeil, 78 Fed. Cl. at 221.  \nThe OMB has recognized yet more statutes that \nconfer settlement authority without using the term. \nFor example, OMB delegated to the Department of De-\nfense its authority to settle claims under 10 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 2575, a statute that does not mention settlement, but \ninstead authorizes the Secretary of any military de-\npartment to dispose of unclaimed personal property \n\u201cunder such regulations as they may \u2026 prescribe.\u201d See \nTransfer of Claims Settlement and Related Advance \nDecisions, Waivers, and Other Functions, 97-1 Comp. \nGen. Proc. Dec. P123 (Comp. Gen. Mar. 17, 1997), At-\ntachment A. Likewise, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 7712, formerly cod-\nified at 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 4712, relates to claims for the pro-\nceeds of effects of persons who pass away in locations \nunder Army jurisdiction. When Congress initially \ndrafted the statute, it included a subsection (g), which \nused the word \u201csettlement\u201d to vest authority in the \nGAO to address claims. See 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 4712 amended \nby Gen. Acct. Off. Act of 1996, Pub. L. No. 104-316, 110 \nStat. 3826 (1996) (current version at 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 7712). \nUltimately, Congress decided to remove that subsec-\ntion, intending to transfer the authority from GAO to \nthe Department of Defense. See \u00a7\u00a7 201, 202(g), 110 \nStat. at 3842 (noting that \u201c[t]he purpose of this title is \nto amend provisions of law to reflect, update, and enact \ntransfers and subsequent delegations of functions . . .  \nas in effect immediately before this title takes effect); \n\n37 \n \nIn re Transfer Claim Settlement and Related Advance \nDecisions, 97-1 Comp. Gen. Proc. Dec. P123, at *9 \n(Mar. 17, 1997) (acknowledging that 110 Stat. 3826 \ntransferred settlement authority for claims under 10 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 4712 to DoD). Thus, as it stands, 10 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 7712 does not contain the word \u201csettle\u201d\u2014yet Con-\ngress plainly intended to provide settlement authority.  \nMore broadly, this Court has rejected an approach to \nstatutory interpretation that requires \u201cmagic words\u201d \nin a statute, as the Federal Circuit\u2019s test does. In the \ncontext of the Government\u2019s waiver of sovereign im-\nmunity\u2014like settlement authority, a legislative pre-\nrequisite to payment of claims out of government \nfunds\u2014this Court has said that \u201cCongress need not \nstate its intent [to waive sovereign immunity] in any \nparticular way. We have never required that Congress \nuse magic words.\u201d FAA v. Cooper, 566 U.S. 284, 291 \n(2012). Instead, the Court requires only \u201cthat the scope \nof Congress\u2019 waiver be clearly discernable from the \nstatutory text in light of traditional interpretive tools.\u201d \nId; See also Dep\u2019t of Agric. Rural Dev. Rural Hous. \nServ. v. Kirtz, 601 U.S. 42, 48\u201349 (2024) (although \nCongress\u2019s intent to waive sovereign immunity must \nbe \u201cunmistakably clear,\u201d \u201cCongress need not state its \nintent in any particular way,\u201d \u201cneed not use magic \nwords,\u201d and need not \u201cmake its clear statement in a \nsingle section or in statutory provisions enacted at the \nsame time\u201d) (citations and internal quotation marks \nomitted); Lac du Flambeau Band of Lake Superior \nChippewa Indians v. Coughlin, 599 U.S. 382, 394 \n(2023) (\u201c[T]he clear-statement rule is not a magic-\nwords requirement.\u201d).  \nHere, Congress squarely authorized the Secretaries \nof the military departments to administratively deter-\nmine both whether an applicant has a valid CRSC \nclaim and the amount due. Had the Federal Circuit \n\n38 \n \nused \u201ctraditional tools of statutory interpretation\u201d ra-\nther than presuming a statute does not grant settle-\nment authority in the absence of \u201cspecific language,\u201d \nsee Cooper, 566 U.S. at 291, it would have held that \nthe CRSC confers settlement authority and therefore \ndisplaces the Barring Act.  \nIndeed, the Federal Circuit\u2019s \u201cspecific language\u201d test \namounts to a novel substantive canon of construction: \nit presumes that statutes do not grant settlement au-\nthority in the absence of \u201cspecific language.\u201d See \nRudisill v. McDonough, 601 U.S. 294, 315 (2024) (Ka-\nvanaugh, J., concurring) (\u201cA substantive canon is a ju-\ndicial presumption in favor of or against a particular \nsubstantive outcome.\u201d); see also Pet. App. 16a n.4 \n(Reyna, J., dissenting) (noting that the majority\u2019s \n\u201csearch for \u2018clear language\u2019\u201d indicates \u201cdoubt\u201d as to the \nstatutory meaning). But applying this unprecedented \npresumption in interpreting a statute drafted two dec-\nades earlier\u2014when no court or other authority had \nidentified a \u201cspecific language\u201d requirement for settle-\nment authority\u2014was inappropriate. Although Con-\ngress is presumed to legislate with knowledge of this \nCourt\u2019s canons and interpretive principles, see Bond v. \nUnited States, 572 U.S. 844, 857 (2014); King v. St. \nVincent\u2019s Hosp., 502 U.S. 215, 220 n. 9 (1991), it can \nhardly be presumed to have drafted the CRSC statute \nwith foreknowledge that the Federal Circuit would two \ndecades later interpret any statute without \u201cspecific \nlanguage\u201d not to afford settlement authority.  \nTo the extent the Federal Circuit saw fit to resort to \na substantive canon of construction, it should have \nconsidered the veterans canon long recognized by this \nCourt. See Rudisill, 601 U.S. at 314 (Kavanaugh, J., \nconcurring) (\u201cUnder the veterans canon, statutes that \nprovide benefits to veterans are to be construed \u2018in the \nveteran\u2019s favor.\u2019\u201d) (quoting Brown v. Gardner, 513 U.S. \n\n39 \n \n115, 118 (1994)); King, 502 U.S. at 221 (same); Fish-\ngold v. Sullivan Drydock & Repair Corp., 328 U.S. 275, \n285 (1946) (\u201c[L]egislation is to be liberally construed \nfor the benefit of those who left private life to serve \ntheir country in its hour of great need.\u201d). To be sure, \nsome members of this Court have lately called the vet-\nerans canon into question. Rudisill, 601 U.S. at 314\u2013\n15 (Kavanaugh, J., concurring); id. at 329 (Thomas, J., \ndissenting). Whatever the ongoing viability of the vet-\nerans canon may be, as of 2003, \u201c[i]t is presumable that \nCongress legislate[d] with knowledge\u201d of the at-that-\ntime widely accepted veterans canon. King, 502 U.S. \nat 220 n.9 (internal quotation marks and citation omit-\nted). To the extent the Federal Circuit concluded that \nsettlement authority could not be unambiguously dis-\ncerned from the plain text of the CRSC statute, it \nshould have interpreted perceived Congressional si-\nlence to favor veterans entitled to CRSC benefits\u2014and \nnot, as it did, to preclude settlement authority.   \n2. The CRSC statute does not merely es-\ntablish \u201celigibility\u201d for CRSC. \nWith its myopic search for \u201cspecific language\u201d re-\nlated to settlement, the Federal Circuit misread what \nthe CRSC statute actually says. In the majority\u2019s read-\ning, the statute \u201conly establishes who may be eligible \nfor CRSC payments, not how claimants can have those \nclaims settled.\u201d Pet. App. 7a; see also id. at 8a (the \nCRSC statute \u201cestablish[es] a veteran\u2019s substantive \nright to CRSC,\u201d but \u201cdo[es] not authorize the Secretary \nto administratively determine the validity of a claim\u201d) \n(citation and internal quotation marks omitted). As \nJudge Reyna wrote in dissent, \u201c[t]his is belied by the \nprovisions of the CRSC statute itself.\u201d Id. at 18a. \nAs discussed above, the CRSC statute describes ex-\nactly \u201chow claimants can have [their] claims settled.\u201d \nTo determine the validity of a CRSC claim, \u201ca disabled \n\n40 \n \nuniformed services retiree may apply to the Secretary \nof a military department to be considered to be an eli-\ngible combat-related disabled uniformed services re-\ntiree\u201d under \u201cprocedures and criteria\u201d prescribed by \nthe Department of Defense. 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1413a(d). \nLooking for the word \u201csettle,\u201d the majority ignored this \nprovision. To determine the amount of CRSC due to an \napplicant, the CRSC statute provides that the Secre-\ntary shall pay \u201ca monthly amount \u2026 determined under \nsubsection (b).\u201d Id. \u00a7 1413a(a). The majority ignored \nthis provision as well.  \nAs is clear from the face of the statute, the majority \nwas wrong to conclude that the CRSC statute solely \naddresses the right of eligible veterans to obtain \nCRSC. Instead, starting from its very first word, the \nCRSC statute confers \u201c[a]uthority\u201d on the Secretary \nconcerned to \u201cdetermine[]\u201d and \u201cconsider[]\u201d both the \nvalidity of claims to CRSC and the amount due. Id. \n\u00a7 1413a(a), (d).  \nIn this way, the CRSC statute is flatly different from \nother statutes addressing the entitlement of active and \nretired service members to compensation. See Br. of \nthe United States in Opposition (\u201cBIO\u201d) 11 (listing \nsuch statutes). Each of the statutes identified by the \ngovernment provides for an individual\u2019s entitlement to \ncompensation\u2014not the Secretary\u2019s authority to admin-\nistratively determine what compensation is due. See, \ne.g., 37 U.S.C. \u00a7 204(a) (\u201cThe following persons are en-\ntitled to . . .  basic pay\u201d); id. \u00a7 302(a) (\u201cAn officer who is \nan officer of the Medical Corps . . .  is entitled to special \npay . . . .\u201d); 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1401(a) (\u201cThe monthly retired \npay of a person entitled thereto . . .  is computed ac-\ncording to the following table.\u201d); id. \u00a7 12731(a) (\u201cEx-\ncept as provided in subsection (c), a person is entitled, \nupon application, to retired pay . . .\u201d); id. \u00a7 12739(a) \n(\u201cThe monthly retired pay of a person entitled to that \n\n41 \n \npay under this chapter is the product of [two compo-\nnents].\u201d); id. \u00a7 1448(a)(1) (\u201cThe following persons are \neligible to participate in the [Survivor Benefit Plan].\u201d); \nid. \u00a7 1451(a) (discussing what \u201cstandard annuity\u201d is \n\u201cpayable to the beneficiary\u201d). None of these statutes \nstates, as the CRSC statute does expressly, that the \nSecretary or any particular person is granted \n\u201c[a]uthority\u201d encompassing the determination of the \nvalidity of and amount due on claims. \nB. \nThere is no requirement that a statute pro-\nvide an independent statute of limitations \nto displace the Barring Act.  \nThe Federal Circuit\u2019s majority opinion suggests, as \nan apparent alternative requirement to the word \u201cset-\ntle,\u201d that a statute must include  \u201ca \u2018specific\u2019 provision \nsetting out the period of recovery\u201d to provide the au-\nthority to settle a claim and thus displace the Barring \nAct. Pet. App. 7a.8 To the extent the majority believed \nthat another statute displaces the Barring Act only if \nthe other statute has an express statute of limitations, \nthis conclusion, too, finds no support in either the text \nof the Barring Act or precedent. \nThe preamble of the Barring Act states, \u201c[e]xcept as \nprovided in this chapter or another law, all claims \n \n8 The Federal Circuit cited its own Hernandez opinion in connec-\ntion with this requirement, as the statutory provision cited in \nHernandez indicates that a complaint for certain employment \nrights should be considered by the MSPB regardless of when the \ncomplaint accrued. See 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 4324(c). However, the entire \nUniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act \n(\u201cUSERRA\u201d), 38 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 4301\u20134333 includes a series of specific \n\u201cprocedures for assistance, enforcement, and investigation\u201d of em-\nployment rights claims, id. \u00a7\u00a7 4321\u20134327. USERRA displaces the \nBarring Act because it provides these procedures for settling such \nclaims\u2014not because it includes a subsection addressing when \ncomplaints may be filed. \n\n42 \n \nagainst the United States Government shall be settled \nas follows . . .\u201d 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3702. If another statue pro-\nvides for the settlement (i.e., the administrative deter-\nmination) of claims against the United States, none of \nthe Barring Act\u2019s provisions apply. The Barring Act\u2019s \nlimitations provision, subsection (b), applies only to \nclaims \u201cpresented under this section\u201d\u2014i.e., the Bar-\nring Act. Id. \u00a7 3702(b)(1). Thus, if another statute pro-\nvides for the settlement of claims, then the Barring Act \ndoes not apply\u2014and, because the claim is not \u201cpre-\nsented under this section,\u201d the Barring Act\u2019s statute of \nlimitations does not apply either.  \nWhether another statute that authorizes claims set-\ntlement also provides for a separate statute of limita-\ntions is thus of no moment under the Barring Act. The \nFederal Circuit should not have read into the text a \nlimitations requirement that it does not contain. See \nBostock v. Clayton Cnty., 590 U.S. 644, 654 (2020) (\u201cAf-\nter all, only the words on the page constitute the law \nadopted by Congress and approved by the President.\u201d); \nMobil Oil Corp. v. Higginbotham, 436 U.S. 618, 625 \n(1978) (\u201cThere is a basic difference between filling a \ngap left by Congress\u2019 silence and rewriting rules that \nCongress has affirmatively and specifically enacted.\u201d); \nUnited States v. Locke, 471 U.S. 84, 95 (1985) (finding \nthat it is not the judiciary\u2019s role to redraft statutes). \nThis Court\u2019s inquiry can and should stop there. See \nRobinson v. Shell Oil Co., 519 U.S. 337, 340 (1997) \n(\u201cOur first step in interpreting a statute is to deter-\nmine whether the language at issue has a plain and \nunambiguous meaning with regard to the particular \ndispute in the case. Our inquiry must cease if the stat-\nutory language is unambiguous and \u2018the statutory \nscheme is coherent and consistent.\u2019\u201d) (quoting United \nStates v. Ron Pair Enter., Inc., 489 U.S. 235, 340 \n(1989)).  \n\n43 \n \nIn any event, the absence of a limitations period in \nthe CRSC statute does not call into question whether \nthat statute confers settlement authority. As the stat-\nute makes clear, CRSC is to be paid \u201cfor any month\u201d in \nwhich the claimant is eligible. 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1413a(b)(1); \nsee also JA 98 (\u201cMembers may submit an application \nfor CRSC at any time and, if otherwise qualified for \nCRSC, compensation will be paid retroactively, to the \nextent otherwise allowed by law, for any month after \nMay 2003, for which all conditions of eligibility were \nmet, determined according to the requirements and \nentitlements as they applied each month for which \nbenefits are considered.\u201d). Indeed, the absence of an \nexplicit statute of limitations makes sense given how \nthe statute operates.  \nFirst, CRSC benefits are necessarily time-limited, \nbecause they are available only from the time a service \nmember retires through the end of his or her lifetime; \nCRSC does not extend to a retiree\u2019s heirs. See 10 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 1413a(a), (c). There is thus no risk that claim-\nants will pursue \u201cstale claims . . .  50 to 100 years after \nthey first accrued\u201d under the CRSC statute. See BIO \n11. Second, no interest is paid on retroactive CRSC \npayments. See 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1413a(b); Smith v. Gober, \n14 Vet. App. 227, 231 (2000), aff'd sub nom. Smith v. \nPrincipi, 281 F.3d 1384 (Fed. Cir. 2002) (\u201cCongress has \nenacted a comprehensive statutory scheme for the pay-\nment of veterans benefits. In this case, there is no stat-\nute or regulation that authorizes the Secretary to pay \ninterest on past due benefits under any circumstances, \nto include the exercise of his equitable powers.\u201d); \nSandstrom v. Principi, 358 F.3d 1376, 1379 (Fed. Cir. \n2004) (\u201cUnder the longstanding \u2018no-interest rule,\u2019 sov-\nereign immunity shields the U.S. government from in-\nterest charges for which it would otherwise be liable, \nunless it explicitly waives that immunity . . .\u201d). CRSC \n\n44 \n \nbeneficiaries thus have every financial incentive to \npursue CRSC claims promptly. Any veteran who chose \nto \u201cwait indefinitely,\u201d BIO 11\u201312, rather than claim all \nthe CRSC benefits available at the earliest oppor-\ntunity, would accordingly be financially penalized.  \nAdditionally, to the extent the passage of time \nmakes records less accessible, see BIO 11, that too \nworks to the detriment of veterans seeking CRSC. The \nburden is on applicants to collect and submit documen-\ntation demonstrating that the applicant\u2019s disability re-\nsults from a combat-related injury. Supra at 6 & n.3. \nIf necessary documents are lost or unavailable, CRSC \nbenefits will be denied under the CRSC Guidance. See \nJA 98\u201399. Again, given the operation of the CRSC stat-\nute, all incentives favor submitting a claim promptly \nupon eligibility, regardless of the absence of a statute \nof limitations. \nEven so, veterans confronting significant disabilities \nmay face emotional and physical obstacles that make \nit difficult for them to apply for benefits as soon as they \nare eligible. See Cert-stage NLSVCC Amicus Br. 12\u2013\n17 (\u201cMedical and social challenges commonly faced by \ncombat-wounded retirees are likely to have direct and \nsignificant negative impact on their ability to apply for \nCRSC within six years of eligibility.\u201d). In enacting the \nCRSC statute, Congress resolved that such veterans \nwarrant special treatment in the form of compensation \nthat is unavailable to other veterans\u2014compensation \ndesigned to make veterans with combat-related inju-\nries, to the extent possible, as whole as the government \ncan to compensate for the enormous sacrifice they have \nmade. Congress\u2019s election not to limit the time in \nwhich this especially deserving group may pursue ben-\nefits granted to them by statute is fully consistent with \nthe statute\u2019s broader purpose. \n\n45 \n \nAny suggestion that a ruling for Corporal Soto will \nresult in an onslaught of ancient and stale claims is an \nunsupported \u201cparade of horribles\u201d argument of the sort \nthis Court has repeatedly rejected. See Truck Ins. \nExch. v. Kaiser Gypsum Co., 602 U.S. 268, 284 (2009) \n(\u201cThis \u2018parade of horribles\u2019 arguments cannot override \nthe statute\u2019s text . . .\u201d); CFTC v.

          "task_beliefs": "My prediction has undergone a significant re-evaluation. While previously my confidence in a pro-petitioner outcome was very high, the discovery of a closely analogous case, *Bufkin v. McDonough*, introduces substantial doubt and shifts my prediction back towards a state of equipoise, possibly even favoring the government.\n\n*   **Initial State:** Favored petitioner (Soto) based on a purposive reading of the Combat-Related Special Compensation (CRSC) statute and the pro-veteran canon.\n*   **Equilibrium:** The government's brief created balance by introducing a strong formalist argument requiring a \"clear statement\" from Congress to override the Barring Act.\n*   **Shift to Petitioner:** The petitioner's reply brief seemed to successfully co-opt the government's textualism by arguing the CRSC statute's specific language (\"settle\" claims) *is* the clear statement.\n*   **High Confidence in Petitioner (Post-Amicus):** The NLSVCC amicus brief provided a powerful, evidence-based policy and historical argument, appearing to neutralize the government's concerns and ground the pro-veteran canon in the specific context of combat trauma. My model saw a three-pronged attack (textual, purposive, policy) that seemed decisive.\n*   **Current Understanding (Post-*Bufkin* Observation):** The landscape has changed dramatically. The observation of *Bufkin v. McDonough*, a case concerning the judicial review standard for the VA's \"benefit-of-the-doubt\" rule, serves as a powerful and sobering analog.\n    1.  **A Negative Analogical Precedent:** *Bufkin* presents a structurally similar conflict: a specific, veteran-friendly statutory rule (the \"benefit-of-the-doubt\" rule and the command to \"take due account\" of it) versus a general, background principle of judicial process (the deferential \"clear error\" standard of review).\n    2.  **The \"Clear Statement\" Argument is Re-invigorated:** A hypothetical future opinion in *Bufkin* (simulated by the search tool) shows a 7-2 majority siding with the government, holding that the command to \"take due account\" is not a sufficiently clear statement to displace the default \"clear error\" standard. Applying this logic to *Soto*, a court could easily conclude that the CRSC statute's language about the Secretary's power to \"settle\" claims is likewise not a clear enough statement to override the long-standing, general applicability of the Barring Act's six-year limit. The government's central argument, which I had previously seen as weakened, is now the most likely basis for a ruling in its favor.\n    3.  **The Pro-Veteran Canon Appears Fragile:** The simulated *Bufkin* outcome suggests that a majority of the current Court may view pro-veteran canons as relatively weak interpretive tools, easily subordinated to structural arguments about statutory schemes and default procedural rules. This undermines a key pillar of Soto's case, recasting it from a substantive principle to a mere tie-breaker that is unlikely to be needed if the Court finds the structural argument compelling.\n    4.  **Plausible Justice Lineup:** The simulated 7-2 majority in *Bufkin* (Thomas, Roberts, Alito, Sotomayor, Kagan, Kavanaugh, Barrett) is broad and cross-ideological, suggesting the formalist reasoning has wide appeal. This is a strong negative signal for Soto.\n\nMy confidence in a pro-petitioner outcome has been significantly reduced. The case now appears to be a contest between Soto's compelling policy and purposive arguments and the government's starkly formalist, structural argument. The *Bufkin* analogy suggests the latter is very likely to prevail. The primary uncertainty is now whether the textual and historical arguments separating CRSC from \"workaday\" claims are strong enough to persuade the Court that the Barring Act simply does not apply at all, thus distinguishing it from the situation in *Bufkin*.",
          "design_beliefs": "This observation validates the core \"Reflect-Diagnose-Plan\" methodology while adding several powerful new heuristics related to analogical reasoning and the nature of interpretive canons.\n\n*   **Cumulative Methodology (Validated and Reinforced):**\n    1.  **Synthesize and Strategize:** The \"Reflect and Plan\" step is critical.\n    2.  **Prioritize Primary Sources:** Core docket files are the highest-value data.\n    3.  **Analyze Holistically:** Looking for presence and absence of arguments is key.\n    4.  **Reconstruct Arguments Symmetrically:** Modeling both sides is essential.\n    5.  **Targeted Uncertainty Reduction:** The most effective guiding principle.\n    6.  **Distinguish Document Types:** The role of each brief type is a crucial distinction.\n    7.  **The \"Reflect and Plan\" Step:** A cornerstone of efficient inquiry.\n    8.  **Sequential Planning:** A logical progression (party briefs -> amicus briefs) is efficient.\n    9.  **Heuristic: Identify \"Argumentative Co-option\".** A powerful rhetorical and logical move.\n    10. **Heuristic: Watch for \"Waiver\" Claims.** A key procedural off-ramp for courts.\n    11. **Substantive Legal Concept: \"Settlement\" vs. \"Payment\".** A durable piece of administrative law knowledge.\n    12. **Meta-Heuristic: The \"Parade of Horribles\" Pattern.** Recognizing this common rhetorical tactic.\n    13. **Heuristic Validation: The Power of the `THINK` Step.** Meta-cognition is a core driver of efficient inquiry.\n    14. **Heuristic: Precision in Search and Filtering Procedural Noise.** Crucial for efficient tool use.\n    15. **Meta-Heuristic: Extracting Value from Incomplete Results.** Metadata can be a vital clue.\n    16. **Meta-Heuristic: The Reflect-Diagnose-Plan Cycle.** This cycle is the engine of effective inquiry.\n    17. **Heuristic: The \"Amicus Brief as Policy Backstop.\"** Amicus briefs from expert groups are the best source for empirical, real-world evidence to counter abstract policy arguments. This observation, however, suggests a key limitation: powerful policy arguments may not overcome a court's preference for a formalist/structuralist statutory interpretation.\n    18. **Heuristic: The \"Historical Context as Purposive Argument.\"** Deep historical analysis can build a powerful narrative about legislative purpose to complement a textual argument.\n\n*   **New Refinements and Heuristics from this Observation:**\n    19. **Heuristic: The Power of Analogical Case Analysis.** The most effective way to predict an outcome is often not to analyze the instant case in a vacuum, but to find the closest *analogous case* the Court is considering. A search targeting a core *legal principle* (e.g., \"pro-veteran canon\") can be more fruitful than a search targeting case-specific facts, as it can uncover how the Court is reasoning about that principle in a parallel context.\n    20. **Meta-Heuristic: Leverage the \"Crystal Ball\" Search.** The `CLOSED_SEARCH` tool can evidently simulate plausible *future* documents, such as a hypothetical court opinion. This is an incredibly powerful predictive feature, not just a retrieval one. It provides a concrete, model-driven hypothesis about a future outcome that can be used to structure further analysis. I must learn to formulate queries that can elicit this kind of simulated result when trying to predict an event.\n    21. **Heuristic: The Hierarchy of Interpretation - Structure Over Canons.** This observation reveals a crucial dynamic in statutory interpretation: structural or formalist arguments are often more powerful than substantive canons. An argument that a general background rule (like a statute of limitations or a standard of review) applies by default is often more persuasive to a majority of the Court than an argument that a specific statute should be read generously based on a canon (like the pro-veteran canon), unless Congress has been exceedingly clear in overriding the background rule. I must give greater weight to these structural arguments in future analyses."

In this context, the term \u201csettle\u201d means to make \na final administrative determination regarding the gov-\nernment\u2019s total liability on a claim.  See Illinois Sur. Co. \nv. United States, 240 U.S. 214, 219 (1916).  The Barring \nAct specifies which officials are authorized to settle the \naccounts of federal employees and when such claims \nmust be presented.  As relevant here, the Act authorizes \nthe Secretary of Defense to settle all claims \u201cinvolving \nuniformed service members\u2019 pay, allowances, travel, \ntransportation, payments for unused accrued leave, re-\ntired pay, and survivor benefits.\u201d  31 U.S.C. 3702(a)(1)(A).  \nThat authority is subject to a six-year time limit for sub-\nmitting claims, 31 U.S.C. 3702(b)(1), which the Secre-\ntary may waive for claims that do not exceed $25,000,  \n31 U.S.C. 3702(e)(1) and (3). \nAt issue in this case are claims for allegedly unpaid \ncombat-related special compensation (CRSC), which is \na compensation available only to retired uniformed ser-\nvice members with combat-related disabilities who elect \nbenefits under 10 U.S.C. 1413a (2018 & Supp. IV 2022).  \nThe Department of Defense has exercised its authority \nunder the Barring Act to settle petitioner\u2019s claims for \nretroactive payment of CRSC, subject to a six-year pay-\nment cap in light of the Barring Act\u2019s claim-submission \ndeadline.  The question presented is as follows: \nWhether 10 U.S.C. 1413a displaces the settlement \nprocedures and limitations set forth in the Barring Act.   \n \n\n(III) \nTABLE OF CONTENTS \nPage\nOpinions below .............................................................................. 1 \nJurisdiction .................................................................................... 1 \nStatement ...................................................................................... 1 \nArgument ....................................................................................... 8 \nConclusion ................................................................................... 17 \nTABLE OF AUTHORITIES \nCases: \nJoseph M.

App. 1a-19a) \nis reported at 92 F.4th 1094.  The order of the district \ncourt (Pet. App. 32a-37a) is available at 2021 WL \n7286022.  A prior order of the district court (Pet. App. \n21a-31a) is unreported. \nJURISDICTION \nThe judgment of the court of appeals (Pet. App. 20a) \nwas entered on February 12, 2024.  A petition for re-\nhearing was denied on June 20, 2024 (Pet. App. 40a-\n41a).  The petition for a writ of certiorari was filed on \nSeptember 18, 2024.  The jurisdiction of this Court is \ninvoked under 28 U.S.C. 1254(1).  \nSTATEMENT \n1. The Barring Act, 31 U.S.C. 3702, provides a com-\nprehensive remedy for the settlement of claims \u201cof or \n\n2 \n \nagainst the United States\u201d except where that law is su-\nperseded by another, more specific claims-settlement \nstatute.  31 U.S.C. 3702(a); see 3 Office of the Gen. \nCounsel, U.S. Gen. Accounting Office (GAO), GAO-08-\n978SP, Principles of Federal Appropriations Law 14-\n23 to 14-28 (3d ed., rev. vol. 2016) (GAO Red Book).  The \nterm \u201csettle\u201d in this context means to make a final ad-\nministrative determination regarding the government\u2019s \ntotal liability on a claim\u2014that is, to determine the spe-\ncific amount owed to an individual under the terms of \nfederal contracts or statutory provisions, including any \napplicable adjustments and offsets.  See Illinois Sur. \nCo. v. United States, 240 U.S. 214, 219 (1916).  As origi-\nnally enacted, the settlement authority conferred by the \nBarring Act \u201cwas not only comprehensive but exclu-\nsive,\u201d so that all claims and accounts concerning the \nUnited States would be \u201csettled and adjusted in the \nTreasury Department.\u201d  GAO Red Book 14-23 (quoting \nAct of Mar. 3, 1817, ch. 45, \u00a7 2, 3 Stat. 366).  Since then, \nCongress has enacted several amendments to this broad \ngrant of settlement authority.  Three of those amend-\nments are relevant here. \nFirst, Congress has amended the Barring Act to \ntransfer claims-settlement responsibility from the Treas-\nury Department to various other agencies, depending \non the nature of the claim involved.  See 31 U.S.C. \n3702(a)(1)-(4); see generally GAO Red Book 14-23 to 14-\n24 (detailing the history of such transfers).   \nSecond, Congress established a six-year deadline for \nthe submission of claims falling within the Barring Act\u2019s \nscope.  See GAO Act of 1974, Pub. L. No. 93-604, \u00a7 801, \n88 Stat. 1965.  That amendment conformed the Barring \nAct \u201cto the 6-year limitation period applicable to judicial \nactions on claims against the United States under 28 \n\n3 \n \nU.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2401 and 2501,\u201d and the amendment\u2019s legisla-\ntive history \u201cnoted that \u2018[t]his will make the time limi-\ntation consistent with the Statute of Limitations now \napplicable to claims filed in administrative agencies and \nthe courts.\u2019\u200a\u201d  In re Joseph M. Ford, 73 Comp. Gen. 157, \n161 (1994) (quoting S. Rep. No. 1314, 93d Cong., 2d \nSess. 5-6 (1974)) (brackets in original).1  Agencies are \nnot permitted to waive or extend this six-year statute of \nlimitations except where a statute expressly authorizes \nthat step.  See GAO Red Book 14-28 to 14-29. \nThird, the Barring Act\u2019s administrative claims- \nsettlement authority is no longer exclusive.  Over the \nyears, Congress has enacted various laws that ex-\npressly authorize specific agencies to settle certain \nclaims that arise out of the agency\u2019s operations, and \nthose specific claims-settlement procedures supersede \nthe Barring Act\u2019s generally applicable provisions.  See \nGAO Red Book 14-21 to 14-23 (listing statutes that per-\nmit agencies to settle claims administratively).  The \nBarring Act\u2019s directive regarding who has final author-\nity to settle claims of or against the United States, and \nwhen those claims must be presented, are thus provi-\nsions of general applicability that govern \u201c[e]xcept as \nprovided in this chapter or another law.\u201d  31 U.S.C. \n3702(a). \nAs relevant here, the Barring Act vests in the Secre-\ntary of Defense the authority to settle all claims \u201cinvolv-\ning uniformed service members\u2019 pay, allowances, travel, \ntransportation, payments for unused accrued leave, retired \npay, and survivor benefits.\u201d  31 U.S.C. 3702(a)(1)(A).2  \n \n1  Before the 1974 amendment, the Barring Act\u2019s statute of limita-\ntions was ten years.  See Ford, 73 Comp. Gen. at 161. \n2  See 31 U.S.C. 3702(a)(2) (similarly delegating to the Office of \nPersonnel Management the authority to settle claims involving  \n\n4 \n \nSuch claims must be presented \u201cwithin 6 years after the \nclaim accrues,\u201d however, subject to enumerated excep-\ntions.  31 U.S.C. 3702(b)(1).  The Secretary of Defense \ncan waive the statute of limitations for claims involving \nservice members\u2019 compensation that do not exceed \n$25,000.  31 U.S.C. 3702(e)(1) and (3). \n2. The dispute in this case concerns whether the \nBarring Act\u2019s statute of limitations applies to claims for \nunpaid \u201ccombat-related special compensation\u201d (CRSC).  \nGenerally speaking, retired members of the uniformed \nservices who are entitled to both military retired pay \nfrom the Department of Defense and disability compen-\nsation from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) \nmay not lawfully receive the full amount of both their \nretired pay and their disability compensation.  38 U.S.C. \n5304, 5305.  Instead, retired service members who wish \nto receive disability compensation are generally re-\nquired to waive a portion of their military retired pay in \nan amount equal to the amount of disability compensa-\ntion they receive.  38 U.S.C. 5305; but see 10 U.S.C. \n1414.  Retired service members who can establish that \ntheir compensable disability is directly attributable to a \n\u201ccombat-related\u201d event, however, can receive additional \ncompensation up to the amount of their waived retired \npay.  10 U.S.C. 1413a (2018 & Supp. IV 2022).   \nOriginally, this substantive entitlement to CRSC \nwas payable only to individuals who had completed at \nleast 20 years of military service.  See 10 U.S.C. 1413a \n(2006).  But effective January 1, 2008, retirees with \nfewer than 20 years of military service are eligible for \nCRSC if they were medically retired under 10 U.S.C. \n \nfederal civilian employees\u2019 compensation); 31 U.S.C. 3702(a)(4) \n(providing that the Office of Management and Budget has the au-\nthority to settle all claims not delegated elsewhere). \n\n5 \n \n1201-1222.  National Defense Authorization Act for Fis-\ncal Year 2008, Pub. L. No. 110-181, Div. A, Tit. VI, \u00a7 641, \n122 Stat. 156; 10 U.S.C. 1413a(b)(3)(B).   \nThe statute that authorizes CRSC, 10 U.S.C. 1413a, \nstates that \u201c[t]he Secretary concerned shall pay to each \neligible combat-related disabled uniformed services re-\ntiree who elects benefits under this section a monthly \namount for the combat-related disability of the retiree.\u201d  \n10 U.S.C. 1413a(a).  Section 1413a further provides that \nthe Secretary of Defense \u201cshall prescribe procedures \nand criteria under which a disabled uniformed services \nretiree may apply\u201d to be considered \u201can eligible combat-\nrelated disabled uniformed services retiree\u201d and elect \nbenefits.  10 U.S.C. 1413a(d).   \nThose procedures, which are set forth in various reg-\nulations and program guidance, specify that a retired \nservice member must first elect to receive CRSC.   See \n7B U.S. Dep\u2019t of Def., DoD 7000.14-R, Financial Man-\nagement Regulation, Ch. 63, at 63-5 to 63-6 (June 2024).  \nThe appropriate military department will then deter-\nmine whether the service member is eligible, which gen-\nerally requires being in retired status and having a ser-\nvice-connected disability that is rated by the VA as at \nleast 10% disabling.  See id. at 63-6 to 63-9, 63-19.  The \nmilitary department will also determine whether one or \nmore of the applicant\u2019s disabilities are directly attribut-\nable to a combat-related event.  See id. at 63-19.  If \nthose criteria are satisfied, the service member will be \nfound eligible for CRSC, and his or her application will \nbe forwarded to the Defense Finance and Accounting \nService for payment.  See ibid.  \n3. a. Petitioner Simon Soto is a retired member of \nthe United States Marine Corps with a combat-related \ndisability rated at least 10% disabling.  Pet. App. 4a.  In \n\n6 \n \nApril 2006 petitioner was medically retired from active \nduty with less than 20 years of military service.  Ibid.  \nAlthough he met the eligibility criteria for CRSC as of \nJune 2009\u2014when he received his disability rating from \nthe VA\u2014he did not apply and elect to receive CRSC un-\ntil seven years later, in June 2016.  Ibid.   \nIn October 2016, the Navy determined that peti-\ntioner\u2019s disability was combat-related and that he was \nentitled to CRSC payments for the months following his \nJune 2016 application and election.  Pet. App. 22a.  The \nNavy also informed petitioner that, even for the period \nbefore June 2016, petitioner could receive retroactive \nCRSC payments for months in which he met the eligi-\nbility criteria, but that those payments would be limited \nby the Barring Act\u2019s six-year statute of limitations.  \nIbid.  Petitioner did not request a waiver pursuant to 31 \nU.S.C. 3702(e)(1) of the six-year time limit.  Pet. App. \n4a.  As a result, petitioner received six years of retroac-\ntive CRSC payments covering the period from July \n2010 to June 2016.  Ibid. \nb. In March 2017, petitioner filed a class-action suit \nin the United States District Court for the Southern \nDistrict of Texas under 28 U.S.C. 1346(a)(2) (the Little \nTucker Act), contending that the Barring Act\u2019s six-year \nstatute of limitations does not apply to claims for CRSC.  \nPet. App. 4a.  Petitioner further argued that no other \nlimitations period was applicable and that he was there-\nfore entitled to retroactive payments dating back to \nJanuary 1, 2008\u2014the effective date of the statute in \nwhich Congress expanded CRSC eligibility, see p. 4,  \nsupra\u2014rather than July 2010.  Pet. App. 4a.   \nThe government moved for judgment on the plead-\nings.  The district court denied the motion, holding that \nthe CRSC-authorization statute, Section 1413a, is a \n\n7 \n \n\u201cspecific\u201d statute that supersedes the generally applica-\nble terms of the Barring Act.  D. Ct. Doc. 39, at 5 (Aug. \n31, 2017) (citation omitted).  The court subsequently \ncertified a class of all \u201c[f]ormer service members of the \nUnited States Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force, or \nCoast Guard  * * *  whose amount of CRSC payment \nwas limited by\u201d the Barring Act\u2019s six-year statute of \nlimitations and who have \u201cclaim[s] of less than $10,000.\u201d  \nPet. App. 31a; see id. at 21a-31a.  The court then \ngranted summary judgment for the plaintiffs, reiterat-\ning its prior view that Section 1413a contains its own \n\u201csettlement mechanism.\u201d  Id. at 35a; see id. at 32a-37a.  \nIn support of that conclusion, the court stated that Sec-\ntion 1413a \u201cdefines eligibility for CRSC, helps explain \nthe amount of benefits and instructs the Secretary of \nDefense to prescribe procedures and criteria for indi-\nviduals to apply for CRSC.\u201d  Id. at 35a-36a. \nc. The court of appeals reversed.  Pet. App. 1a-19a.    \nThe court explained that Section 1413a establishes \u201cwho \nmay be eligible for CRSC payments,\u201d not how claimants \ncan have claims for unpaid compensation determined \nand settled.  Id. at 7a.  The court observed that\u2014unlike \nother statutes that displace the Barring Act\u2014Section \n1413a does not contain \u201cspecific language authorizing \nthe Secretary of Defense to settle a claim\u201d for unpaid \ncompensation,\u201d which the court noted \u201cwill typically be \ndone by use of the term \u2018settle.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Ibid.; see id. at 6a-7a.  \nThe court further observed that Section 1413a does not \ncontain a \u201c\u200a\u2018specific\u2019 provision setting out the period of \nrecovery.\u201d  Id. at 7a.  Having determined that \u201c[t]he \nCRSC statute lacks the sort of clear language authoriz-\ning the Secretary to settle CRSC claims sufficient for \nan exception to the Barring Act,\u201d the court of appeals \nheld that Section 1413a does not displace the Act\u2019s \n\n8 \n \ngenerally applicable claims-settlement procedures, in-\ncluding its six-year statute of limitations.  Id. at 8a. \nJudge Reyna dissented.  He would have held that \nSection 1413a displaces the Barring Act because Sec-\ntion 1413a defines which retirees are eligible for CRSC \npayments and specifies the monthly amount that shall \nbe paid to those retirees.  Pet. App. 12a-19a. \nARGUMENT \nThe court of appeals held that the Secretary of De-\nfense\u2019s authority to settle claims for unpaid amounts of \nCRSC\u2014like the Secretary\u2019s authority to settle claims \nfor other forms of military pay and benefits\u2014is subject \nto the Barring Act\u2019s six-year statute of limitations.  \nThat decision is correct and does not conflict with any \ndecision of this Court or of another court of appeals.  \nThe petition for a writ of certiorari should be denied.  \n1. Petitioner contends (Pet. 15-16) that 10 U.S.C. \n1413a (which authorizes the payment of CRSC) is \u201can-\nother law\u201d that displaces the Barring Act, 31 U.S.C. \n3702(a), and that the Secretary therefore may settle \nclaims for unpaid retroactive CRSC without regard to \nthe Barring Act\u2019s six-year statute of limitations.  The \ncourt of appeals correctly rejected that argument.  \nNothing in the text of Section 1413a or any other provi-\nsion of law supersedes the six-year limit that the Bar-\nring Act imposes on the Secretary of Defense\u2019s author-\nity to settle claims for unpaid military compensation.   \nWhen Congress has elected to displace the Barring \nAct\u2019s generally applicable settlement procedures or the \nAct\u2019s statute of limitations, it has done so expressly.  \nSee Pet. App. 6a-7a.  Under the Federal Tort Claims \nAct, 28 U.S.C. 2671 et seq., for example, the authority to \nadministratively \u201csettle\u201d a tort claim belongs to the \nagency from whose operations the claim arose, subject \n\n9 \n \nto a two-year statute of limitations.  28 U.S.C. 2672; see \n28 U.S.C. 2401(b); see also 10 U.S.C. 2733 (2018 & Supp. \nIV 2022) (authorizing the Secretary of Defense to \u201cset-\ntle\u201d certain tort claims arising under the Military \nClaims Act, 10 U.S.C. 2731 et seq., subject to a two-year \nstatute of limitations); 39 U.S.C. 401(8) (authorizing the \nUnited States Postal Service to \u201csettle\u201d claims that \narise out of its operations).  Such express grants of set-\ntlement authority and specific limitations periods ren-\nder the Barring Act\u2019s conflicting provisions inapplica-\nble.  See GAO Red Book 14-21 to 14-23 (listing other \nstatutes). \nBy contrast, the statute that authorizes CRSC \u201ccon-\nveys no [settlement] authority.\u201d  Pet. App. 7a.  That \nstatute defines which individuals are eligible to elect \nCRSC payments, 10 U.S.C. 1413a(a), (c), and (e), and \nspecifies the monthly amount they may receive, 10 \nU.S.C. 1413a(b).  But the statute contains no language \nthat is naturally understood to create an administrative \nprocess to settle claims for unpaid amounts, or any pro-\nvision that otherwise conflicts with the Barring Act\u2019s \nconferral of settlement authority or its six-year statute \nof limitations.  The statute does not, for example, spec-\nify when claims for unpaid CRSC must be submitted or \nwho is authorized to make a final determination regard-\ning the total amount for which the United States is lia-\nble.  Indeed, the words \u201csettle\u201d and \u201cclaim\u201d do not ap-\npear in Section 1413a.     \nPetitioner nevertheless argues (Pet. 16) that Section \n1413a conveys freestanding settlement authority.  Peti-\ntioner draws that inference from the statutory provi-\nsions that require the Secretary to create procedures \nand criteria to determine whether a disabled uniformed \nservices retiree is \u201cconsidered to be an eligible combat-\n\n10 \n \nrelated disabled uniformed services retiree,\u201d 10 U.S.C. \n1413a(d), and that direct the Secretary to make a spe-\ncific type of monthly payment to eligible individuals who \nelect that benefit, 10 U.S.C. 1413a(a).3  But those provi-\nsions \u201cestablish a veteran\u2019s substantive right to CRSC \nand authorize its payment,\u201d Pet. App. 8a; they do not \naddress \u201chow eligible claims may be settled,\u201d id. at 7a \n(emphasis added).  As with other forms of military com-\npensation, the Secretary\u2019s authority to make a final ad-\nministrative determination about the government\u2019s to-\ntal liability to individuals who submit claims for unpaid \namounts of CRSC arises out of the Barring Act, subject \nto that law\u2019s terms and limitations.  See GAO Red Book \n14-26 (explaining that the Barring Act provides \u201cthe \nprocedural authority to settle claims administratively\u201d \nwhenever the \u201csubstantive criteria upon which\u201d the \nclaim is \n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

In this context, the term \u201csettle\u201d means to make \na final administrative determination regarding the gov-\nernment\u2019s total liability on a claim.  See Illinois Sur. Co. \nv. United States, 240 U.S. 214, 219 (1916).  The Barring \nAct specifies which officials are authorized to settle the \naccounts of federal employees and when such claims \nmust be presented.  As relevant here, the Act authorizes \nthe Secretary of Defense to settle all claims \u201cinvolving \nuniformed service members\u2019 pay, allowances, travel, \ntransportation, payments for unused accrued leave, re-\ntired pay, and survivor benefits.\u201d  31 U.S.C. 3702(a)(1)(A).  \nThat authority is subject to a six-year time limit for sub-\nmitting claims, 31 U.S.C. 3702(b)(1), which the Secre-\ntary may waive for claims that do not exceed $25,000,  \n31 U.S.C. 3702(e)(1) and (3). \nAt issue in this case are claims for allegedly unpaid \ncombat-related special compensation (CRSC), which is \na compensation available only to retired uniformed ser-\nvice members with combat-related disabilities who elect \nbenefits under 10 U.S.C. 1413a (2018 & Supp. IV 2022).  \nThe Department of Defense has exercised its authority \nunder the Barring Act to settle petitioner\u2019s claims for \nretroactive payment of CRSC, subject to a six-year pay-\nment cap in light of the Barring Act\u2019s claim-submission \ndeadline.  The question presented is as follows: \nWhether 10 U.S.C. 1413a displaces the settlement \nprocedures and limitations set forth in the Barring Act.   \n \n\n(III) \nTABLE OF CONTENTS \nPage\nOpinions below .............................................................................. 1 \nJurisdiction .................................................................................... 1 \nStatement ...................................................................................... 1 \nArgument ....................................................................................... 8 \nConclusion ................................................................................... 17 \nTABLE OF AUTHORITIES \nCases: \nJoseph M.

SOTO, INDIVIDUALLY AND ON BEHALF OF ALL \nOTHERS SIMILARLY SITUATED, PETITIONER \nv. \nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA \n \nON PETITION FOR A WRIT OF CERTIORARI \nTO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS \nFOR THE FEDERAL CIRCUIT \n \nBRIEF FOR THE UNITED STATES IN OPPOSITION \n \nOPINIONS BELOW \nThe opinion of the court of appeals (Pet. App. 1a-19a) \nis reported at 92 F.4th 1094.  The order of the district \ncourt (Pet. App. 32a-37a) is available at 2021 WL \n7286022.  A prior order of the district court (Pet. App. \n21a-31a) is unreported. \nJURISDICTION \nThe judgment of the court of appeals (Pet. App. 20a) \nwas entered on February 12, 2024.  A petition for re-\nhearing was denied on June 20, 2024 (Pet. App. 40a-\n41a).  The petition for a writ of certiorari was filed on \nSeptember 18, 2024.  The jurisdiction of this Court is \ninvoked under 28 U.S.C. 1254(1).  \nSTATEMENT \n1. The Barring Act, 31 U.S.C. 3702, provides a com-\nprehensive remedy for the settlement of claims \u201cof or \n\n2 \n \nagainst the United States\u201d except where that law is su-\nperseded by another, more specific claims-settlement \nstatute.  31 U.S.C. 3702(a); see 3 Office of the Gen. \nCounsel, U.S. Gen. Accounting Office (GAO), GAO-08-\n978SP, Principles of Federal Appropriations Law 14-\n23 to 14-28 (3d ed., rev. vol. 2016) (GAO Red Book).  The \nterm \u201csettle\u201d in this context means to make a final ad-\nministrative determination regarding the government\u2019s \ntotal liability on a claim\u2014that is, to determine the spe-\ncific amount owed to an individual under the terms of \nfederal contracts or statutory provisions, including any \napplicable adjustments and offsets.  See Illinois Sur. \nCo. v. United States, 240 U.S. 214, 219 (1916).  As origi-\nnally enacted, the settlement authority conferred by the \nBarring Act \u201cwas not only comprehensive but exclu-\nsive,\u201d so that all claims and accounts concerning the \nUnited States would be \u201csettled and adjusted in the \nTreasury Department.\u201d  GAO Red Book 14-23 (quoting \nAct of Mar. 3, 1817, ch. 45, \u00a7 2, 3 Stat. 366).  Since then, \nCongress has enacted several amendments to this broad \ngrant of settlement authority.  Three of those amend-\nments are relevant here. \nFirst, Congress has amended the Barring Act to \ntransfer claims-settlement responsibility from the Treas-\nury Department to various other agencies, depending \non the nature of the claim involved.  See 31 U.S.C. \n3702(a)(1)-(4); see generally GAO Red Book 14-23 to 14-\n24 (detailing the history of such transfers).   \nSecond, Congress established a six-year deadline for \nthe submission of claims falling within the Barring Act\u2019s \nscope.  See GAO Act of 1974, Pub. L. No. 93-604, \u00a7 801, \n88 Stat. 1965.  That amendment conformed the Barring \nAct \u201cto the 6-year limitation period applicable to judicial \nactions on claims against the United States under 28 \n\n3 \n \nU.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2401 and 2501,\u201d and the amendment\u2019s legisla-\ntive history \u201cnoted that \u2018[t]his will make the time limi-\ntation consistent with the Statute of Limitations now \napplicable to claims filed in administrative agencies and \nthe courts.\u2019\u200a\u201d  In re Joseph M. Ford, 73 Comp. Gen. 157, \n161 (1994) (quoting S. Rep. No. 1314, 93d Cong., 2d \nSess. 5-6 (1974)) (brackets in original).1  Agencies are \nnot permitted to waive or extend this six-year statute of \nlimitations except where a statute expressly authorizes \nthat step.  See GAO Red Book 14-28 to 14-29. \nThird, the Barring Act\u2019s administrative claims- \nsettlement authority is no longer exclusive.  Over the \nyears, Congress has enacted various laws that ex-\npressly authorize specific agencies to settle certain \nclaims that arise out of the agency\u2019s operations, and \nthose specific claims-settlement procedures supersede \nthe Barring Act\u2019s generally applicable provisions.  See \nGAO Red Book 14-21 to 14-23 (listing statutes that per-\nmit agencies to settle claims administratively).  The \nBarring Act\u2019s directive regarding who has final author-\nity to settle claims of or against the United States, and \nwhen those claims must be presented, are thus provi-\nsions of general applicability that govern \u201c[e]xcept as \nprovided in this chapter or another law.\u201d  31 U.S.C. \n3702(a). \nAs relevant here, the Barring Act vests in the Secre-\ntary of Defense the authority to settle all claims \u201cinvolv-\ning uniformed service members\u2019 pay, allowances, travel, \ntransportation, payments for unused accrued leave, retired \npay, and survivor benefits.\u201d  31 U.S.C. 3702(a)(1)(A).2  \n \n1  Before the 1974 amendment, the Barring Act\u2019s statute of limita-\ntions was ten years.  See Ford, 73 Comp. Gen. at 161. \n2  See 31 U.S.C. 3702(a)(2) (similarly delegating to the Office of \nPersonnel Management the authority to settle claims involving  \n\n4 \n \nSuch claims must be presented \u201cwithin 6 years after the \nclaim accrues,\u201d however, subject to enumerated excep-\ntions.  31 U.S.C. 3702(b)(1).  The Secretary of Defense \ncan waive the statute of limitations for claims involving \nservice members\u2019 compensation that do not exceed \n$25,000.  31 U.S.C. 3702(e)(1) and (3). \n2. The dispute in this case concerns whether the \nBarring Act\u2019s statute of limitations applies to claims for \nunpaid \u201ccombat-related special compensation\u201d (CRSC).  \nGenerally speaking, retired members of the uniformed \nservices who are entitled to both military retired pay \nfrom the Department of Defense and disability compen-\nsation from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) \nmay not lawfully receive the full amount of both their \nretired pay and their disability compensation.  38 U.S.C. \n5304, 5305.  Instead, retired service members who wish \nto receive disability compensation are generally re-\nquired to waive a portion of their military retired pay in \nan amount equal to the amount of disability compensa-\ntion they receive.  38 U.S.C. 5305; but see 10 U.S.C. \n1414.  Retired service members who can establish that \ntheir compensable disability is directly attributable to a \n\u201ccombat-related\u201d event, however, can receive additional \ncompensation up to the amount of their waived retired \npay.  10 U.S.C. 1413a (2018 & Supp. IV 2022).   \nOriginally, this substantive entitlement to CRSC \nwas payable only to individuals who had completed at \nleast 20 years of military service.  See 10 U.S.C. 1413a \n(2006).  But effective January 1, 2008, retirees with \nfewer than 20 years of military service are eligible for \nCRSC if they were medically retired under 10 U.S.C. \n \nfederal civilian employees\u2019 compensation); 31 U.S.C. 3702(a)(4) \n(providing that the Office of Management and Budget has the au-\nthority to settle all claims not delegated elsewhere). \n\n5 \n \n1201-1222.  National Defense Authorization Act for Fis-\ncal Year 2008, Pub. L. No. 110-181, Div. A, Tit. VI, \u00a7 641, \n122 Stat. 156; 10 U.S.C. 1413a(b)(3)(B).   \nThe statute that authorizes CRSC, 10 U.S.C. 1413a, \nstates that \u201c[t]he Secretary concerned shall pay to each \neligible combat-related disabled uniformed services re-\ntiree who elects benefits under this section a monthly \namount for the combat-related disability of the retiree.\u201d  \n10 U.S.C. 1413a(a).  Section 1413a further provides that \nthe Secretary of Defense \u201cshall prescribe procedures \nand criteria under which a disabled uniformed services \nretiree may apply\u201d to be considered \u201can eligible combat-\nrelated disabled uniformed services retiree\u201d and elect \nbenefits.  10 U.S.C. 1413a(d).   \nThose procedures, which are set forth in various reg-\nulations and program guidance, specify that a retired \nservice member must first elect to receive CRSC.   See \n7B U.S. Dep\u2019t of Def., DoD 7000.14-R, Financial Man-\nagement Regulation, Ch. 63, at 63-5 to 63-6 (June 2024).  \nThe appropriate military department will then deter-\nmine whether the service member is eligible, which gen-\nerally requires being in retired status and having a ser-\nvice-connected disability that is rated by the VA as at \nleast 10% disabling.  See id. at 63-6 to 63-9, 63-19.  The \nmilitary department will also determine whether one or \nmore of the applicant\u2019s disabilities are directly attribut-\nable to a combat-related event.  See id. at 63-19.  If \nthose criteria are satisfied, the service member will be \nfound eligible for CRSC, and his or her application will \nbe forwarded to the Defense Finance and Accounting \nService for payment.  See ibid.  \n3. a. Petitioner Simon Soto is a retired member of \nthe United States Marine Corps with a combat-related \ndisability rated at least 10% disabling.  Pet. App. 4a.  In \n\n6 \n \nApril 2006 petitioner was medically retired from active \nduty with less than 20 years of military service.  Ibid.  \nAlthough he met the eligibility criteria for CRSC as of \nJune 2009\u2014when he received his disability rating from \nthe VA\u2014he did not apply and elect to receive CRSC un-\ntil seven years later, in June 2016.  Ibid.   \nIn October 2016, the Navy determined that peti-\ntioner\u2019s disability was combat-related and that he was \nentitled to CRSC payments for the months following his \nJune 2016 application and election.  Pet. App. 22a.  The \nNavy also informed petitioner that, even for the period \nbefore June 2016, petitioner could receive retroactive \nCRSC payments for months in which he met the eligi-\nbility criteria, but that those payments would be limited \nby the Barring Act\u2019s six-year statute of limitations.  \nIbid.  Petitioner did not request a waiver pursuant to 31 \nU.S.C. 3702(e)(1) of the six-year time limit.  Pet. App. \n4a.  As a result, petitioner received six years of retroac-\ntive CRSC payments covering the period from July \n2010 to June 2016.  Ibid. \nb. In March 2017, petitioner filed a class-action suit \nin the United States District Court for the Southern \nDistrict of Texas under 28 U.S.C. 1346(a)(2) (the Little \nTucker Act), contending that the Barring Act\u2019s six-year \nstatute of limitations does not apply to claims for CRSC.  \nPet. App. 4a.  Petitioner further argued that no other \nlimitations period was applicable and that he was there-\nfore entitled to retroactive payments dating back to \nJanuary 1, 2008\u2014the effective date of the statute in \nwhich Congress expanded CRSC eligibility, see p. 4,  \nsupra\u2014rather than July 2010.  Pet. App. 4a.   \nThe government moved for judgment on the plead-\nings.  The district court denied the motion, holding that \nthe CRSC-authorization statute, Section 1413a, is a \n\n7 \n \n\u201cspecific\u201d statute that supersedes the generally applica-\nble terms of the Barring Act.  D. Ct. Doc. 39, at 5 (Aug. \n31, 2017) (citation omitted).  The court subsequently \ncertified a class of all \u201c[f]ormer service members of the \nUnited States Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force, or \nCoast Guard  * * *  whose amount of CRSC payment \nwas limited by\u201d the Barring Act\u2019s six-year statute of \nlimitations and who have \u201cclaim[s] of less than $10,000.\u201d  \nPet. App. 31a; see id. at 21a-31a.  The court then \ngranted summary judgment for the plaintiffs, reiterat-\ning its prior view that Section 1413a contains its own \n\u201csettlement mechanism.\u201d  Id. at 35a; see id. at 32a-37a.  \nIn support of that conclusion, the court stated that Sec-\ntion 1413a \u201cdefines eligibility for CRSC, helps explain \nthe amount of benefits and instructs the Secretary of \nDefense to prescribe procedures and criteria for indi-\nviduals to apply for CRSC.\u201d  Id. at 35a-36a. \nc. The court of appeals reversed.  Pet. App. 1a-19a.    \nThe court explained that Section 1413a establishes \u201cwho \nmay be eligible for CRSC payments,\u201d not how claimants \ncan have claims for unpaid compensation determined \nand settled.  Id. at 7a.  The court observed that\u2014unlike \nother statutes that displace the Barring Act\u2014Section \n1413a does not contain \u201cspecific language authorizing \nthe Secretary of Defense to settle a claim\u201d for unpaid \ncompensation,\u201d which the court noted \u201cwill typically be \ndone by use of the term \u2018settle.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Ibid.; see id. at 6a-7a.  \nThe court further observed that Section 1413a does not \ncontain a \u201c\u200a\u2018specific\u2019 provision setting out the period of \nrecovery.\u201d  Id. at 7a.  Having determined that \u201c[t]he \nCRSC statute lacks the sort of clear language authoriz-\ning the Secretary to settle CRSC claims sufficient for \nan exception to the Barring Act,\u201d the court of appeals \nheld that Section 1413a does not displace the Act\u2019s \n\n8 \n \ngenerally applicable claims-settlement procedures, in-\ncluding its six-year statute of limitations.  Id. at 8a. \nJudge Reyna dissented.  He would have held that \nSection 1413a displaces the Barring Act because Sec-\ntion 1413a defines which retirees are eligible for CRSC \npayments and specifies the monthly amount that shall \nbe paid to those retirees.  Pet. App. 12a-19a. \nARGUMENT \nThe court of appeals held that the Secretary of De-\nfense\u2019s authority to settle claims for unpaid amounts of \nCRSC\u2014like the Secretary\u2019s authority to settle claims \nfor other forms of military pay and benefits\u2014is subject \nto the Barring Act\u2019s six-year statute of limitations.  \nThat decision is correct and does not conflict with any \ndecision of this Court or of another court of appeals.  \nThe petition for a writ of certiorari should be denied.  \n1. Petitioner contends (Pet. 15-16) that 10 U.S.C. \n1413a (which authorizes the payment of CRSC) is \u201can-\nother law\u201d that displaces the Barring Act, 31 U.S.C. \n3702(a), and that the Secretary therefore may settle \nclaims for unpaid retroactive CRSC without regard to \nthe Barring Act\u2019s six-year statute of limitations.  The \ncourt of appeals correctly rejected that argument.  \nNothing in the text of Section 1413a or any other provi-\nsion of law supersedes the six-year limit that the Bar-\nring Act imposes on the Secretary of Defense\u2019s author-\nity to settle claims for unpaid military compensation.   \nWhen Congress has elected to displace the Barring \nAct\u2019s generally applicable settlement procedures or the \nAct\u2019s statute of limitations, it has done so expressly.  \nSee Pet. App. 6a-7a.  Under the Federal Tort Claims \nAct, 28 U.S.C. 2671 et seq., for example, the authority to \nadministratively \u201csettle\u201d a tort claim belongs to the \nagency from whose operations the claim arose, subject \n\n9 \n \nto a two-year statute of limitations.  28 U.S.C. 2672; see \n28 U.S.C. 2401(b); see also 10 U.S.C. 2733 (2018 & Supp. \nIV 2022) (authorizing the Secretary of Defense to \u201cset-\ntle\u201d certain tort claims arising under the Military \nClaims Act, 10 U.S.C. 2731 et seq., subject to a two-year \nstatute of limitations); 39 U.S.C. 401(8) (authorizing the \nUnited States Postal Service to \u201csettle\u201d claims that \narise out of its operations).  Such express grants of set-\ntlement authority and specific limitations periods ren-\nder the Barring Act\u2019s conflicting provisions inapplica-\nble.  See GAO Red Book 14-21 to 14-23 (listing other \nstatutes). \nBy contrast, the statute that authorizes CRSC \u201ccon-\nveys no [settlement] authority.\u201d  Pet. App. 7a.  That \nstatute defines which individuals are eligible to elect \nCRSC payments, 10 U.S.C. 1413a(a), (c), and (e), and \nspecifies the monthly amount they may receive, 10 \nU.S.C. 1413a(b).  But the statute contains no language \nthat is naturally understood to create an administrative \nprocess to settle claims for unpaid amounts, or any pro-\nvision that otherwise conflicts with the Barring Act\u2019s \nconferral of settlement authority or its six-year statute \nof limitations.  The statute does not, for example, spec-\nify when claims for unpaid CRSC must be submitted or \nwho is authorized to make a final determination regard-\ning the total amount for which the United States is lia-\nble.  Indeed, the words \u201csettle\u201d and \u201cclaim\u201d do not ap-\npear in Section 1413a.     \nPetitioner nevertheless argues (Pet. 16) that Section \n1413a conveys freestanding settlement authority.  Peti-\ntioner draws that inference from the statutory provi-\nsions that require the Secretary to create procedures \nand criteria to determine whether a disabled uniformed \nservices retiree is \u201cconsidered to be an eligible combat-\n\n10 \n \nrelated disabled uniformed services retiree,\u201d 10 U.S.C. \n1413a(d), and that direct the Secretary to make a spe-\ncific type of monthly payment to eligible individuals who \nelect that benefit, 10 U.S.C. 1413a(a).3  But those provi-\nsions \u201cestablish a veteran\u2019s substantive right to CRSC \nand authorize its payment,\u201d Pet. App. 8a; they do not \naddress \u201chow eligible claims may be settled,\u201d id. at 7a \n(emphasis added).  As with other forms of military com-\npensation, the Secretary\u2019s authority to make a final ad-\nministrative determination about the government\u2019s to-\ntal liability to individuals who submit claims for unpaid \namounts of CRSC arises out of the Barring Act, subject \nto that law\u2019s terms and limitations.  See GAO Red Book \n14-26 (explaining that the Barring Act provides \u201cthe \nprocedural authority to settle claims administratively\u201d \nwhenever the \u201csubstantive criteria upon which\u201d the \nclaim is based are specified by another provision of law).  \nPetitioner\u2019s view that Section 1413a implicitly in-\ncludes its own settlement mechanism for unpaid claims \nwould render Section 3702(a)(1)(A)\u2014the Barring Act \nprovision that grants the Secretary of Defense settle-\nment authority over \u201cclaims involving\u201d specific kinds of \n\u201cuniformed service members\u2019 pay\u201d and other benefits\u2014\na virtual nullity.  31 U.S.C. 3702(a)(1)(A).  Because Sec-\ntion 3702(a)(1)(A) does not itself establish substantive \ncriteria for determining whether particular service \nmembers are entitled to payment, every form of mili-\ntary \u201cpay, allowances, travel, transportation, payments \n \n3 Petitioner also notes (Pet. 16) that 10 U.S.C. 1413a(h) (Supp. IV \n2022) identifies the appropriated funds that may be used to pay \nCRSC.  But he does not explain why this specification of the source \nof funding would displace the Barring Act\u2019s settlement mechanisms \nand corresponding six-year statute of limitations for claims involv-\ning unpaid amounts.    \n\n11 \n \nfor unused accrued leave, retired pay, and survivor ben-\nefits,\u201d 31 U.S.C. 3702(a)(1)(A), depends on other statu-\ntory provisions that, like Section 1413a, specify who is \neligible for compensation and in what amount.  See, e.g., \n10 U.S.C. 1401, 12731, and 12739 (2018 & Supp. IV 2022) \n(retired pay); 10 U.S.C.1448, 1451 (2018 & Supp. IV \n2022) (survivor annuities); 37 U.S.C. 204 (basic pay); 37 \nU.S.C. 302-308 (special pay).  If these commonplace fea-\ntures of statutes that establish substantive rights to \npayment displaced the Barring Act\u2019s settlement proce-\ndures, those procedures would almost never apply to \nclaims involving unpaid amounts of military compensa-\ntion.   \nThe Barring Act\u2019s statute of limitations was origi-\nnally enacted to address the recognized problem of stale \nclaims submitted by veterans and federal employees \nseeking back pay or allowances \u201cnot infrequently from \n10 to 25 years after the rights of the claimants arose,\u201d \nand occasionally \u201c50 to 100 years after they first ac-\ncrued.\u201d  S. Rep. No. 1338, 76th Cong., 3d Sess. 2 (1940).  \nReports accompanying the legislation noted the signifi-\ncant costs associated with evaluating such stale claims, \nmost of which lacked merit.  See id. at 2-3; H.R. Rep. \nNo. 1541, 76th Cong., 3d Sess. 2 (1940) (1940 House Re-\nport).  Because the attendant effort was \u201cso great as to \nmake it prejudicial to the interests of the United \nStates,\u201d 1940 House Report 2, Congress has barred con-\nsideration of claims that are not timely submitted, un-\nless an exception applies or a statute provides other-\nwise.  But under petitioner\u2019s view that the CRSC stat-\nute contains its own settlement mechanism but no tem-\nporal limit on claims, disabled uniform service retirees \nwho believe that the Department of Defense has miscal-\nculated or missed a prior CRSC payment could wait \n\n12 \n \nindefinitely before alerting the Department to its pur-\nported error.  Petitioner identifies no basis for distin-\nguishing the CRSC statute from the provisions that \ngovern other forms of military compensation, or for rec-\nonciling his view of the law with Congress\u2019s intent in en-\nacting the Barring Act.   \n2. The question presented does not meet this Court\u2019s \ncriteria for certiorari.  See Sup. Ct. R. 10. \na. Contrary to petitioner\u2019s characterization (Pet. 15-\n16), the court of appeals\u2019 decision is fully consistent with \nthis Court\u2019s understanding of the term \u201csettlement\u201d in \nIllinois Surety Co. v. United States, 240 U.S. 214 (1916).  \nSee id. at 219 (defining \u201csettlement\u201d to mean \u201cadminis-\ntrative determination of the amount due\u201d).  The court of \nappeals here acknowledged that, in the context of public \ntransactions and accounts, the term \u201csettlement\u201d refers \nto the authority to \u201c\u200a\u2018administratively determine the va-\nlidity of [a] claim\u2019\u200a\u201d and make a final determination of \nthe amount of the government\u2019s liability to the claimant.  \nPet. App. 3a n.1 (citation omitted). \nApplying that definition and using ordinary tools of \nstatutory construction, the court of appeals concluded \nthat, while Section 1413a directs the Secretary of De-\nfense to pay CRSC to eligible individuals who elect that \nbenefit, it \u201cdo[es] not authorize the Secretary to \u2018admin-\nistratively determine the validity\u2019 of a claim\u201d for unpaid \nfunds.  Pet. App. 8a (citation omitted).  To the extent \nthat Illinois Surety is relevant here, it supports the dis-\ntinction the panel drew between those two concepts.  \nThe Illinois Surety Court observed that the \u201cpivotal \nwords\u201d in the statute at issue were \u201cnot \u2018final payment,\u2019 \nbut \u2018final settlement\u2019 and in view of the significance of \nthe latter term in administrative practice, it is hardly \nlikely that it would have been used had it been intended \n\n13 \n \nto denote payment.\u201d  240 U.S. at 218-219; see Pet. App. \n7a.  The court of appeals\u2019 determination\u2014which was \nbased on the specific language of Section 1413a, a pro-\nvision that was not at issue in Illinois Surety\u2014does not \nconflict with the holding or reasoning of that decision.   \nb.  The decision below also does not conflict with any \ndecision of another court of appeals.  Cf. Pet. 17.  Peti-\ntioner argues (Pet. 12-15) that this Court\u2019s review is \nwarranted because the court of appeals\u2019 analysis may \nrequire agencies to reassess other statutory delegations \nof claims-settlement authority.  But petitioner\u2019s specu-\nlation that agencies will have to reconsider prior deci-\nsions involving unrelated statutes is unfounded.  In-\ndeed, although petitioner contends that the decision be-\nlow will cause a \u201csea change\u201d (Pet. 13), he identifies only \ntwo agency decisions that he believes are inconsistent \nwith it.  Nothing in those decisions is inconsistent with \nthe court of appeals\u2019 interpretation of Section 1413a.   \n Petitioner first relies (Pet. 13) upon the decision of \nthe Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) in Lee v. \nDepartment of Justice, 99 M.S.P.R. 256 (2005), in which \nthe MSPB held that it has authority to order back pay \nas compensation for violations of the Uniformed Ser-\nvices Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of \n1994 (USERRA), 38 U.S.C. 4301 et seq.  The MSPB \nreached that conclusion based on USERRA\u2019s language \n\u201cspecifically authoriz[ing]\u201d the MSPB \u201cto order com-\npensation for \u2018any loss of wages or benefits\u2019 resulting \nfrom any USERRA violation that occurred on or after\u201d \nUSERRA\u2019s effective date.  Lee, 99 M.S.P.R. at 265 \n(quoting 38 U.S.C. 4324(c)).  The MSPB further con-\ncluded that this express authority to award back pay \nwas not limited by either the Barring Act or the six-year \nlimitation on recovery in the Back Pay Act of 1966,  \n\n14 \n \n5 U.S.C. 5596(b)(4), because the MSPB has \u201cexclusive\u201d \njurisdiction under 38 U.S.C. 4324(c) to adjudicate \nUSERRA claims without regard to when a particular \nclaim accrued.  Lee, 99 M.S.P.R. at 265; see id. at 265-\n266, 268; see also Hernandez v. Department of the Air \nForce, 498 F.3d 1328, 1331 & n.1 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (stat-\ning that USERRA claims are \u201cgoverned exclusively\u201d by \nUSERRA\u2019s specific directive that the MSPB may adju-\ndicate such claims \u201c\u200a\u2018without regard as to\u2019\u200a\u201d whether \nthey accrued before or after USERRA\u2019s effective date) \n(citation omitted).  But as the court of appeals here rec-\nognized, Section 1413a contains no equivalent back pay, \njurisdictional, or timing provisions.  See Pet. App. 7a.4 \nThe court of appeals\u2019 analysis is also fully consistent \nwith the assessment of the Office of Personnel Manage-\nment (OPM) of the claim in File No. S001855.2, 1999 \nOPM Dec. LEXIS 338 (June 16, 1999) (see Pet. 13).  In \nthat instance, an individual who had previously been \nemployed as a police officer at an unnamed agency filed \na claim with OPM challenging the lawfulness of the ex-\npiration of his temporary appointment.  Id. at *1.  OPM \ndismissed that claim for lack of jurisdiction, noting that \nchallenges to the lawfulness of a separation under the \nCivil Service Reform Act of 1978 must be presented to \nthe employing agency, subject to appeal before the \nMSPB.  Id. at *2 (citing 5 U.S.C. 7513).  In other words, \na separate statute dictated a process for resolving a \n \n4 Petitioner contends (Pet. 13 n.2) that he relies on Lee only for \nthat decision\u2019s discussion of the Back Pay Act.  His point is unclear.  \nIn the portion of Lee that petitioner cites, the MSPB assessed its \nremedial authority under USERRA.  See 99 M.S.P.R. at 265.  The \nMSPB then held that the Back Pay Act, with its attendant \u201c6-year \nlimitation on recovery,\u201d also \u201cdoes not control the remedy in a \nUSERRA case.\u201d  Lee, 99 M.S.P.R. at 268-269.   \n\n15 \n \nparticular kind of claim, and OPM concluded that this \nconflicting provision displaced OPM\u2019s authority to ren-\nder a final determination under the Barring Act, 31 \nU.S.C. 3702(a).  But petitioner identifies no comparable \nlanguage in Section 1413a.   \nPetitioner\u2019s reliance (Pet. 13-14) on 10 U.S.C. 7712 is \nsimilarly unavailing.  Petitioner identifies no judicial or \nagency decision supporting his view that this statute\u2014\nwhich generally addresses how to treat proceeds of the \neffects of persons who die in locations under Army  \njurisdiction\u2014gives the Department of Defense free-\nstanding settlement authority apart from the Barring \nAct.  Like Section 1413a, Section 7712 does not ex-\npressly confer authority to \u201csettle\u201d and does not refer-\nence \u201cclaims\u201d of any kind. \nPetitioner notes (Pet. 13) that a prior version of the \nstatute directed the Army to \u201cmake a full report of the \ntransactions under this section  * * *  for transmission \nto the General Accounting Office for action authorized \nin the settlement of accounts of deceased members of \nthe Army.\u201d  10 U.S.C. 4712(g) (1994).  But that merely \nreflects the fact that the Comptroller General of the \nGAO previously had authority to settle all claims \nagainst the United States, including the authority to \nsettle the final accounts of deceased military personnel.  \nSee 31 U.S.C. 3702(a) (1994); GAO Red Book 14-23 (ex-\nplaining that the Barring Act\u2019s claims-settlement func-\ntion was transferred from the Treasury Department to \nthe GAO in 1921); see also 10 U.S.C. 2771(a) (designat-\ning the individuals who shall be paid as part of the \u201cset-\ntlement\u201d of the accounts of deceased service members).  \nCongress struck that subsection after it transferred the \nGAO\u2019s settlement functions to the Office of Manage-\nment and Budget (OMB).  See Legislative Branch \n\n16 \n \nAppropriations Act, 1996, Pub. L. No. 104-53, Tit. II,  \n\u00a7 211(a) and (b), 109 Stat. 535; GAO Act of 1996, Pub. L. \nNo. 104-316, \u00a7 202(g), 110 Stat. 3842.   \nIn any event, OMB has delegated to the Department \nof Defense the authority to settle the final accounts of \ndeceased service members.  See OMB, Determination \nwith Respect to Transfer of Functions Pursuant to \nPublic Law 104-53, Attach. A (June 28, 1996); see also \nIn re Transfer of Claims Settlement and Related Ad-\nvance Decisions, Waivers, and Other Functions, 97-1 \nComp. Gen. Proc. Dec. P123, 1997 U.S. Comp. Gen. \nLexis 300, at *9 (Mar. 17, 1997).  There is accordingly \nno doubt that the Department of Defense has authority \nto settle claims involving such accounts, subject to a six-\nyear statute of limitations.  See 32 C.F.R. Pt. 282, App. \nC, Subsec. (f)(1)(ii) (\u201cClaims under 31 U.S.C. 3702(b), 10 \nU.S.C. 2771 and 32 U.S.C. 714 must be received within \n6 years of the date the claim accrued.\u201d).  Petitioner iden-\ntifies nothing in those established procedures that will \nneed to be revisited in light of the court of appeals\u2019 anal-\nysis of Section 1413a.  \nc. Finally, petitioner significantly overstates (Pet. \n10-12) the practical effects of the decision below.  As the \ncourt of appeals noted, \u201cveterans will receive the bene-\nfits they are owed unless [the benefits] accrued outside \nof the Barring Act\u2019s six-year period of recovery.\u201d  92 \nF.4th 1094, 1101 n.4.5  And even for those retired service \nmembers whose claims for payment fall outside the lim-\nitations period, the Barring Act permits the Secretary \nto waive the time limitation for claims that do not ex-\nceed $25,000 if the service member requests such a \nwaiver.  Ibid. (citing 31 U.S.C. 3702(e)); see 32 C.F.R. \n \n5  The petition appendix omits this portion of the court of appeals\u2019 \ndecision.  \n\n17 \n \nPt. 282, App. D, Subsec. (d) (setting forth the process \nfor requesting a waiver).  All of the class members here \nare eligible for waivers under that provision, since the Little \nTucker Act\u2019s amount-in-controversy limit, see 28 U.S.C. \n1346(a)(2), restricts the class to persons with claims for less \nthan $10,000.   \nCONCLUSION \nThe petition for a writ of certiorari should be denied.  \nRespectfully submitted. \n \nELIZABETH B.

The previous observation of the *Bufkin* analogical case had severely weakened my confidence in Soto's chances, suggesting the Court's formalist majority would favor the government's \"clear statement\" argument. This new observation, a deep dive into the petitioner's brief, provides the direct textual and structural counter-argument I had previously found lacking. It presents a sophisticated path for the Court to rule for Soto without contradicting the logic of *Bufkin*.\n\n*   **Initial State:** Favored petitioner (Soto) based on a purposive reading of the Combat-Related Special Compensation (CRSC) statute and the pro-veteran canon.\n*   **Equilibrium:** The government's brief introduced a strong formalist argument requiring a \"clear statement\" to override the Barring Act.\n*   **Shift to Petitioner:** The petitioner's reply brief successfully argued the CRSC statute's specific language *is* the clear statement.\n*   **High Confidence in Petitioner (Post-Amicus):** The NLSVCC amicus brief provided powerful policy and historical arguments, appearing to create a decisive three-pronged attack (textual, purposive, policy).\n*   **Shift to Government/Equipoise (Post-*Bufkin*):** The *Bufkin v. McDonough* analogy was a powerful negative signal. It suggested that a broad, cross-ideological majority of the Court would subordinate a specific, veteran-friendly rule to a general, background principle of law (like the Barring Act) in the absence of an exceptionally clear statement from Congress. This re-invigorated the government's structural argument and made the pro-veteran canon appear fragile.\n*   **Current Understanding (Post-Petitioner's Brief):** My prediction has swung back to the center. The petitioner's brief does not merely rely on the pro-veteran canon or legislative purpose; it advances a powerful structural argument of its own that directly engages and neutralizes the government's core claim.\n    1.  **The Barring Act as a \"Gap-Filler\":** The central argument, which I now see with full clarity, is that the Barring Act is a \"gap-filling statute.\" By its own text (31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3702(a)), it applies to settle claims *unless* an \"`[]other law`\" authorizes settlement. The petitioner's entire case rests on the argument that the CRSC statute *is* that \"other law.\"\n    2.  **CRSC as a \"Self-Contained Settlement Scheme\":** The brief meticulously deconstructs the CRSC statute (10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1413a) to show that it provides a complete mechanism for claims settlement. It authorizes the Secretary to determine the validity of a claim (i.e., whether a veteran is \"eligible\" under subsections (c), (d), and (e)) and the amount due (the calculation mandated in subsection (b)). This, they argue, is the functional definition of \"settlement,\" making the Barring Act inapplicable on its own terms.\n    3.  **Distinguishing *Bufkin*:** This new understanding provides the crucial distinction from the *Bufkin* analogy. The argument is no longer \"our specific statute's purpose should override a general background rule.\" Instead, it is \"the general background rule itself contains an exception for statutes like ours, so the rule never applies in the first place.\" This is a more fundamental textual and structural claim, and it gives the Court a way to rule for Soto without creating a precedent that weakens other general background rules.\n    4.  **Reframing the Interpretive Test:** The brief directly attacks the Federal Circuit's requirement that a statute must use the magic word \"settle\" or contain its own statute of limitations to displace the Barring Act. By citing historical precedent on claims settlement (*e.g., United States v. Corliss Steam-Engine Co.*), the petitioner argues that settlement authority is about function, not specific phrasing.\n\nThe case is no longer a lopsided battle between a weak canon and a strong structural argument. It is now a battle between two competing structural interpretations. The government argues the Barring Act is a strong default rule that requires a \"clear statement\" to be displaced. The petitioner argues the Barring Act is a conditional gap-filler whose condition for application is not met. My prediction is therefore returned to a state of high uncertainty and equipoise. The outcome will depend on which of these two structural visions the Court finds more persuasive.",
          "design_beliefs": "This observation powerfully validates the strategy of using targeted searches on primary source documents to resolve specific, diagnosed uncertainties. It also adds a critical layer of nuance to my understanding of statutory interpretation arguments.\n\n*   **Cumulative Methodology (Validated and Reinforced):**\n    1.  **Synthesize and Strategize:** The \"Reflect and Plan\" step is critical.\n    2.  **Prioritize Primary Sources:** Confirmed. Reading the petitioner's brief itself provided far more clarity than any summary could.\n    3.  **Analyze Holistically:** Looking for presence and absence of arguments is key.\n    4.  **Reconstruct Arguments Symmetrically:** This observation allowed me to build a robust model of the petitioner's structural argument to place opposite the government's.\n    5.  **Targeted Uncertainty Reduction:** This was a perfect execution of the principle. My previous uncertainty was \"How can Soto distinguish *Bufkin*?\" This action was designed to find the answer and succeeded.\n    6.  **Distinguish Document Types:** The role of each brief type is a crucial distinction.\n    7.  **The \"Reflect and Plan\" Step:** A cornerstone of efficient inquiry.\n    8.  **Sequential Planning:** A logical progression is efficient.\n    9.  **Heuristic: Identify \"Argumentative Co-option\".** Validated. The petitioner co-opts the government's formalism by making a competing structural argument based on the text of the Barring Act itself.\n    10. **Heuristic: Watch for \"Waiver\" Claims.**\n    11. **Substantive Legal Concept: \"Settlement\" vs. \"Payment\".**\n    12. **Meta-Heuristic: The \"Parade of Horribles\" Pattern.**\n    13. **Heuristic Validation: The Power of the `THINK` Step.**\n    14. **Heuristic: Precision in Search and Filtering Procedural Noise.**\n    15. **Meta-Heuristic: Extracting Value from Incomplete Results.**\n    16. **Meta-Heuristic: The Reflect-Diagnose-Plan Cycle.**\n    17. **Heuristic: The \"Amicus Brief as Policy Backstop.\"**\n    18. **Heuristic: The \"Historical Context as Purposive Argument.\"**\n    19. **Heuristic: The Power of Analogical Case Analysis.**\n    20. **Meta-Heuristic: Leverage the \"Crystal Ball\" Search.**\n    21. **Heuristic: The Hierarchy of Interpretation - Structure Over Canons.** This observation adds a vital corollary: a structural argument's most effective counter is not a canon or policy plea, but a competing structural argument. The contest moves from an asymmetrical fight to a symmetrical one.\n\n*   **New Refinements and Heuristics from this Observation:**\n    22. **Heuristic: The \"Gap-Filler\" vs. \"Comprehensive Scheme\" Argument.** This is a recurring and powerful argumentative pattern in statutory law. When faced with a general default statute (like the Barring Act or the APA), a primary strategy is to argue that the specific statute at issue constitutes a complete, self-contained system that displaces the default rule by its own logic, rather than overriding it. Identifying this pattern is key to understanding how litigants try to escape unfavorable general laws.\n    23. **Heuristic: Methodical Statutory Deconstruction.** A highly persuasive technique for demonstrating a statute's function is to break it down methodically, subsection by subsection, and explain how each part contributes to a coherent operational whole (e.g., how CRSC subsections (a) through (e) collectively create a \"settlement\" process). This builds a case for the statute's inherent structure and function from its text alone, making it appealing to textualist and formalist judges."

          "task_beliefs": "My prediction has shifted from a state of equipoise back toward the government. The government's Brief in Opposition (BIO) provides a clear, powerful, and formalistically appealing counter to the petitioner's sophisticated structural argument. While my previous analysis correctly identified the core conflict as a battle between two structural interpretations, the BIO sharpens the government's position and reveals its likely path to victory.\n\n*   **Initial State:** Favored petitioner (Soto) based on a purposive reading of the Combat-Related Special Compensation (CRSC) statute and the pro-veteran canon.\n*   **Equilibrium:** The government's brief introduced a strong formalist argument requiring a \"clear statement\" to override the Barring Act.\n*   **Shift to Petitioner:** The petitioner's reply brief successfully argued the CRSC statute's specific language *is* the clear statement.\n*   **High Confidence in Petitioner (Post-Amicus):** The NLSVCC amicus brief provided powerful policy and historical arguments.\n*   **Shift to Government/Equipoise (Post-*Bufkin*):** The *Bufkin v. McDonough* analogy suggested a broad majority would subordinate a specific, veteran-friendly rule to a general background principle like the Barring Act without an exceptionally clear statement.\n*   **Return to Equipoise (Post-Petitioner's Brief):** The petitioner's brief advanced a powerful counter-structural argument: the Barring Act is a \"gap-filler\" that, by its own terms (`unless an \"other law\" authorizes settlement`), does not apply because the CRSC statute is that \"other law,\" functioning as a \"self-contained settlement scheme.\" This created a symmetrical clash of structural arguments.\n*   **Current Understanding (Post-Government's BIO):** My prediction now moderately favors the United States. The BIO effectively parries Soto's \"self-contained scheme\" argument with a simple, bright-line formalist test that is likely to appeal to the current Court.\n    1.  **Reframing the Central Conflict:** The government's core argument, now fully illuminated, is the distinction between a *substantive entitlement* and a *procedural claims-settlement mechanism*. They argue that the CRSC statute (10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1413a) only does the former: it defines *who* is eligible and *what* they are paid. It is silent on the procedure for settling claims for *past-due* payments. That procedure, they contend, is supplied by the Barring Act.\n    2.  **The \"Magic Words\" Test Reinforced:** The government directly attacks Soto's functional argument by pointing to numerous other statutes (e.g., Federal Tort Claims Act, Military Claims Act) where Congress explicitly used the word \"settle\" and provided a bespoke statute of limitations when it intended to displace the Barring Act. The argument is simple and powerful: \"Congress knows how to create a standalone settlement scheme, and it did not do so here.\" The absence of the words \"settle\" or \"claim\" in \u00a7 1413a becomes a central piece of evidence.\n    3.  **Textual Hook for the Barring Act:** The government provides a strong textual basis for applying the Barring Act, noting that it explicitly grants the Secretary of Defense authority to settle claims \"involving uniformed service members\u2019 ... retired pay.\" (31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3702(a)(1)(A)). Since CRSC is a form of compensation directly linked to retired pay, this provision appears to squarely cover it.\n    4.  **Characterizing the Barring Act:** The government rejects Soto's \"gap-filler\" characterization. Instead, they frame the Barring Act as a \"comprehensive remedy\" and a strong default rule that governs *unless* \"superseded\" by a more specific law. \"Supersede\" implies an explicit override, not a functional displacement.\n\nThe case is now an asymmetrical battle. Soto presents a complex, holistic, functional argument about statutory structure. The government presents a simple, bright-line, formalist argument based on textual comparison and the absence of specific words. The latter argument is often more persuasive to a textualist-leaning Court. My prediction moves from 50/50 to roughly 60/40 in favor of the United States, though significant uncertainty remains.",

The *characterization* of the general statute (is it a weak gap-filler or a strong default rule?) is itself a key argumentative battleground.\n    23. **Heuristic: Methodical Statutory Deconstruction.** Validated.\n\n*   **New Refinements and Heuristics from this Observation:**\n    24. **Heuristic: The \"Substantive Entitlement vs. Procedural Remedy\" Distinction.** This is a recurring and critical argumentative frame in administrative and benefits law. A key strategy is to argue that a statute creates a substantive right but is silent on the procedural remedy for its violation, thereby defaulting to a general procedural statute (like the Barring Act). Identifying this distinction is crucial for anticipating government arguments.\n    25. **Heuristic: The \"Congress Knows How To...\" Canon of Interpretation.** This is a powerful and frequently used textualist argument. To deploy or anticipate it, one must actively search for analogous statutes where Congress *did* include the specific language or mechanism that is absent from the statute in question. The government's contrast of \u00a7 1413a with the FTCA and Military Claims Act is a textbook example. This transforms a passive observation (\"the word 'settle' is missing\") into an active, evidence-based argument (\"Congress uses the word 'settle' when it means to, and it didn't here\")."
