    "facts_of_the_case": "The Surface Transportation Board (STB) granted a petition from the Seven County Infrastructure Coalition to construct and operate an 80-mile railway in Utah\u2019s Uinta Basin. The railway\u2019s primary purpose would be to transport waxy crude oil from the basin to the national rail network. The STB conducted an environmental review process, including the preparation of an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS), as required by the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). The Board issued a final decision in December 2021, authorizing the construction and operation of the railway subject to environmental mitigation conditions.\n\nIn its environmental analysis, the STB considered various impacts of the railway\u2019s construction and operation within the project area, including effects on water resources, air quality, special status species, land use, and local economies. However, the Board declined to analyze certain \u201cdownline impacts\u201d\u2014effects from increased train traffic on existing rail lines beyond the new railway. The STB also omitted analysis of other potential environmental effects, such as increased crude oil refining impacts on Gulf Coast communities, upline impacts of increased drilling in the Uinta Basin, and downline effects of potential oil spills along the Colorado River. Finally, the Board did not disclose the potential effects of the project on historic sites or structures along the Union Pacific line in Eagle County. The Board justified these omissions by arguing that minimal increases in train traffic on existing lines were unlikely to cause significant impacts, and that some effects were beyond the scope of its regulatory authority.\n\nEagle County asked the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit to review the Board\u2019s orders, and the granted the petitions in part, denied them in part, and vacated the underlying order.",

By identifying the petition for certiorari as the optimal starting point, it creates a clear and efficient path to acquiring high-value information about the petitioner's core arguments, the framing of the legal question, and the reasons the Court took the case. This is a significant gain in understanding *how* to approach the task, which is a prerequisite for a successful prediction.\n\nDesign EIG (0.7): The action has high design value because it articulates a foundational, generalizable strategy for SCOTUS prediction: 'start with the cert petition to understand the arguments the Court found compelling enough to grant review.' This insight moves the agent from a state of no knowledge about design (D) to having a core, reusable heuristic. Recognizing that the petitioner's framing for the Court is a key persuasive element is a significant update to the model of judicial decision-making.\n\nJoint EIG (1.3): The action is highly valuable overall because the proposed plan (reading the petition) is efficient, promising to yield significant information for both the task and design parameters simultaneously.

I now understand that the central issue is a question of statutory interpretation under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). Specifically, the case will determine the required scope of an agency's environmental review. The core conflict is whether the Surface Transportation Board (STB) was required to analyze environmental impacts beyond the proximate effects of the 80-mile railway it authorized\u2014such as \"downline\" effects on existing rail lines, \"upline\" effects from increased oil drilling, and potential impacts on Gulf Coast refineries. The D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals found the STB's narrower review insufficient and vacated its order, creating the basis for the appeal to the Supreme Court. My immediate goal is to understand the petitioner's (Seven County Infrastructure Coalition) specific legal arguments for why the D.C. Circuit was wrong. The most direct path to this knowledge is to analyze the petition for a writ of certiorari, which will outline their core claims, the precedents they rely on, and their stated reason for why this case is of national importance (e.g., a circuit split or a critical error in the lower court's interpretation of NEPA).",

My first observation, derived from internal reasoning, has provided a foundational heuristic. I now believe that a highly effective initial strategy for any SCOTUS case prediction is to **analyze the petition for a writ of certiorari**. This document is not just a procedural filing; it is a strategic instrument designed to persuade the Court to take the case. Therefore, it provides critical insight into the petitioner's theory of the case and, more importantly, which arguments they believe will resonate with the current justices. This informs my understanding of what constitutes a \"persuasive argument\" in the current legal landscape. Furthermore, I have learned the importance of **categorizing the legal question** early in the process. Identifying this case as one of \"statutory interpretation within administrative law\" is a crucial step. This categorization helps to narrow the field of relevant legal doctrines (e.g., textualism vs. purposivism, the scope of agency authority, potential application of the major questions doctrine) and judicial philosophies that are likely to be decisive. My strategy, therefore, is evolving from a blank slate to a structured approach: 1) Categorize the case type, and 2) Analyze the cert petition to map the primary arguments and understand the persuasive framing that brought the case to the Court's attention."

However, this observation provides a crucial new meta-level insight regarding the *execution* of these strategies. My simple, direct search for the document failed, teaching me that **information retrieval requires flexibility and resilience.** A belief in a source's value is insufficient; one must also have robust methods for accessing it. My design beliefs now incorporate a new heuristic: **If a precise, targeted search for a key document fails, broaden the search parameters, try alternative phrasings, or browse the source repository before abandoning the search.** My methodology has evolved from a simple \"analyze the cert petition\" to a more robust \"locate and analyze the cert petition, employing iterative search techniques to overcome potential access failures.\" This acknowledges that the reliability of search tools and the precision of queries are critical variables in the experimental design process."

App. 1a-71a) \nis reported at 82 F.4th 1152.  The decisions of the Sur-\nface Transportation Board (Pet. App. 74a-189a, 190a-\n230a) are available at 2021 WL 41926 and 2021 WL \n5960905. \nJURISDICTION \nThe judgment of the court of appeals was entered on \nAugust 18, 2023.  A petition for rehearing en banc was \n \n1  The federal respondents supporting petitioners represented by \nthe Solicitor General in this brief include the Surface Transporta-\ntion Board.  Although the Board did not participate at the certiorari \nstage (see Gov\u2019t Br. in Opp. 2 n.1), it was a party before the court of \nappeals and is therefore a respondent in this Court.   \n\n2 \n \ndenied on December 4, 2023 (Pet. App. 72a-73a).  The \npetition for a writ of certiorari was filed on March 4, \n2024, and granted on June 24, 2024.  The jurisdiction of \nthis Court rests on 28 U.S.C. 1254(1) and 2350. \nSTATUTORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED \nPertinent statutory provisions are reproduced in the \nappendix to this brief.  App., infra, 1a-14a.   \nSTATEMENT \n1. Enacted in 1970, the National Environmental Pol-\nicy Act of 1969 (NEPA), Pub. L. No. 91-190, 83 Stat. 852 \n(42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.), establishes a set of \u201c\u200a\u2018action-\nforcing\u2019 procedures that require\u201d agencies to \u201ctake a \n\u2018hard look\u2019 at environmental consequences\u201d before un-\ndertaking major federal actions that will affect the en-\nvironment.  Robertson v. Methow Valley Citizens Coun-\ncil, 490 U.S. 332, 350 (1989) (citation omitted).  Congress \ndeclared that the purpose of those procedural require-\nments is to encourage efforts to \u201cprevent or eliminate \ndamage to the environment\u201d and improve public health \nand welfare, while also enhancing understanding of the \nenvironment. 42 U.S.C. 4321; accord Department of \nTransp. v. Public Citizen, 541 U.S. 752, 756 (2004) \n(quoting 42 U.S.C. 4321); see 42 U.S.C. 4331 (describing \ntenets of the \u201cnational environmental policy\u201d) (empha-\nsis omitted).   \nNEPA\u2019s core procedural provision requires agencies \nto prepare a \u201cdetailed statement\u201d in connection with a \nproposal for \u201cmajor Federal actions significantly affect-\ning the quality of the human environment.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \n4332(2)(C).  As originally enacted, the statute required \nthese environmental impact statements to include  \nanalysis of (among other things) the \u201cenvironmental im-\npact of the proposed action\u201d and any unavoidable \u201cad-\nverse environmental effects\u201d of the proposal.  NEPA  \n\n3 \n \n\u00a7 102(c)(i) and (ii), 83 Stat. 853.  The original statute also \nestablished the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ), \na new entity charged with overseeing the national envi-\nronmental policy the statute pronounced.  42 U.S.C. \n4342.   \nIn a set of 2023 amendments enacted after the \nagency decisions in this case, Congress clarified the ap-\npropriate scope of an environmental impact statement \nby specifying that the statement should analyze the \n\u201creasonably foreseeable environmental effects of the \nproposed agency action.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C)(i); see \nFiscal Responsibility Act of 2023 (2023 Act), Pub. L. No. \n118-5, Div. C, Tit. III, \u00a7 321(a)(3)(B), 137 Stat. 38.  Be-\nfore that amendment, longstanding CEQ regulations \nhad similarly specified that agencies should consider \nthe \u201creasonably foreseeable\u201d environmental effects of \ntheir proposed actions.  43 Fed. Reg. 55,978, 56,004 \n(Nov. 29, 1978) (40 C.F.R. 1508.8(b) (1979)).  In 2020, \nCEQ had revised the regulations to define \u201c[r]easona-\nbly foreseeable\u201d to mean \u201csufficiently likely to occur \nsuch that a person of ordinary prudence would take it \ninto account in reaching a decision.\u201d  85 Fed. Reg. \n43,304, 43,376 (July 16, 2020) (40 C.F.R. 1508.1(aa) (2021)) \n(emphasis omitted).  That definition remains in place to-\nday.  See 40 C.F.R. 1508.1(aa).  \n2. a. The Surface Transportation Board (Board) is \na federal agency that regulates rail carriers and rail-\nroads.  Because the Board is the successor to the Inter-\nstate Commerce Commission, its authority is set out in \nthe ICC Termination Act of 1995 (the Interstate Com-\nmerce Act), Pub. L. No. 104-88, 109 Stat. 803 (49 U.S.C. \n10101 et seq.).   \nThe Interstate Commerce Act grants the Board \u201cex-\nclusive\u201d federal jurisdiction over \u201ctransportation by rail \n\n4 \n \ncarrier[s]\u201d and \u201cthe construction, acquisition, opera-\ntion, abandonment, or discontinuance\u201d of railway lines \nand related facilities.  49 U.S.C. 10501(b)(2).  The Act \nalso charges the Board with enforcing the statute\u2019s \n\u201c[c]ommon-carrier\u201d obligation, which requires railroads \nto carry all commodities upon reasonable request\u2014 \nincluding hazardous and other environmentally-sensitive \nmaterials.  See 49 U.S.C. 11101; Riffin v. Surface Transp. \nBd., 733 F.3d 340, 345-347 (D.C. Cir. 2013); accord Ak-\nron, Canton & Youngstown R.R. v. ICC, 611 F.2d 1162, \n1166-1168 (6th Cir. 1979) (common-carrier railroad \nmust carry nuclear waste), cert. denied, 449 U.S. 830 \n(1980).   \nb. An entity that wishes to construct or operate a \nnew railroad line must generally seek a license from the \nBoard.  49 U.S.C. 10901.  One way to obtain a license is \nto file an application with the Board.  See 49 U.S.C. \n10901(c).  This approach initiates a process that involves \npublic notice and a proceeding to evaluate the applica-\ntion, and the Board is required to \u201cissue a certificate au-\nthorizing\u201d the construction \u201cunless the Board finds that \nsuch activities are inconsistent with the public conven-\nience and necessity.\u201d  Ibid.; see 49 C.F.R. 1151.2.  \nAlternatively, as in this case, an applicant may re-\nquest Board authorization through a more summary \n\u201cexemption\u201d process under 49 U.S.C. 10502.  The Board \nmay grant an exemption when it finds that a full pro-\nceeding under Section 10901 \u201cis not necessary to carry \nout the rail transportation policy of [S]ection 10101\u201d of \nthe Interstate Commerce Act, and that either the \n\u201ctransaction or service is of limited scope\u201d or full pro-\nceedings are \u201cnot needed to protect shippers from the \nabuse of market power.\u201d  49 U.S.C. 10502(a).  Under the \nexemption process, the Board does not apply the \u201cpublic \n\n5 \n \nconvenience and necessity\u201d standard from Section \n10901(c); instead the Board assesses the transportation \nmerits of the construction or operation proposal based \non statutorily enumerated policies for \u201cregulating the \nrailroad industry\u201d set out in 49 U.S.C. 10101.  See 49 \nU.S.C. 10502(a)(1).  The Act provides that \u201cthe Board, \nto the maximum extent consistent with [the Act],\u201d shall \ngrant an exemption when it finds these criteria satis-\nfied.  49 U.S.C. 10502(a).  Under both the application \nand exemption processes, there is a presumption in fa-\nvor of approving rail construction projects. \n3. a. Petitioners seek to construct an 85-mile-long \nrailway line in Utah connecting the Uinta Basin in \nnortheastern Utah to the existing interstate freight rail \nnetwork near Kyune, Utah.  Pet. App. 190a-191a.  Be-\ncause the Basin is surrounded by high mountains and \nplateaus with elevations up to 13,000 feet above sea \nlevel, transportation options are limited.  C.A. App. 259-\n260, 822.  Freight must currently be transported by \ntruck on two-lane highways.  Pet. App. 7a.  A new rail-\nway line would furnish an additional transportation op-\ntion for moving goods into and out of the Basin.  Ibid.  \nAnd because waxy crude oil is the main commodity cur-\nrently transported by trucks in the Uinta Basin, that \nwould be the new line\u2019s primary freight.  Ibid. \nIn May 2020, petitioners sought the Board\u2019s author-\nization for the railway line by invoking the Interstate \nCommerce Act\u2019s exemption process under Section \n10502.  Pet. App. 6a-7a.  The Board conducted the ex-\nemption process in this case through bifurcated pro-\nceedings.  Id. at 9a-11a.  The Board issued a preliminary \ndecision in January 2021 addressing the transportation \nmerits of the proposed project before the Board\u2019s envi-\nronmental analysis was complete, id. at 9a, and then is-\n\n6 \n \nsued a final decision taking account of the completed en-\nvironmental analysis later that same year, id. at 10a-\n11a.   \nb. The environmental analysis involved multiple \nstages.  In October 2020, the Board issued a draft envi-\nronmental impact statement in connection with the pro-\nject.  Pet. App. 10a.  The Board then opened a public com-\nment process that continued until February 12, 2021.  \nDuring that process, the Board conducted six public \nmeetings and received over 1900 comments.  Ibid.  In \nAugust 2021, the Board issued its final environmental \nimpact statement.  Id. at 76a.   \nThe Board\u2019s final environmental impact statement \nspanned more than 600 pages.  It was supported by \nmore than 2200 pages of appendices containing tech-\nnical analysis and other materials, as well as a separate \n728-page document with the Board\u2019s responses to public \ncomments\u2014resulting in more than 3600 pages of analy-\nsis in total.2 \nThe Board\u2019s final environmental impact statement \nidentified and analyzed a series of \u201csignificant and ad-\nverse impacts that could occur as a result of the pro-\nposed rail line.\u201d  J.A. 121.  Those impacts included the \ndisturbance of local \u201cwaters and wetlands\u201d that would \noccur due to the line\u2019s construction, the \u201cwayside noise\u201d \nthat would be created by the trains newly running \nthrough the area, J.A. 123-124, the alterations to land \nuse and recreation, J.A. 124, and the effects on \u201c[t]ribal \n[c]oncerns\u201d\u2014although the Board noted that the tribe \nwhose land is in the Basin supported the project, J.A. \n125-126; see Ute Indian Tribe of the Uintah and Ouray \nReservation Amici Br. (filed Apr. 4, 2024).  The environ-\n \n2 The full statement and appendices are available at http://www. \nuintabasinrailwayeis.com/DocumentsAndLinks.aspx.   \n\n7 \n \nmental impact statement also considered several \u201cmi-\nnor impacts\u201d that \u201cwould not be significant\u201d if certain \nmitigation measures were adopted.  J.A. 126.  Those im-\npacts included \u201cair quality and greenhouse gas[]\u201d emis-\nsions in the area of construction and the effect of the \nnew construction on local big game, fish, and wildlife.  \nJ.A. 132 (capitalization and emphasis omitted); see J.A. \n126-134.  In addition, the statement considered the \n\u201cdownline impacts\u201d that the new railway line would cre-\nate on existing lines by increasing the volume of traffic.  \nJ.A. 134.  And the statement considered the cumulative \nimpacts of the project, addressing the \u201crelevant past, \npresent, and reasonably foreseeable projects and ac-\ntions that could have impacts that coincide in time and \nlocation with the potential impacts of the proposed rail \nline.\u201d  J.A. 135; see J.A. 135-136.  \nAmong the \u201ccumulative impacts\u201d the Board identi-\nfied were the effects of increased oil production in the \nUinta Basin spurred by the increased transportation ca-\npacity for oil furnished by the new railroad line.  J.A. \n135.  Although the Board found that there were many \nunknowns and uncertainties in connection with the con-\nsequences of additional oil and gas development, the \nagency nonetheless estimated the amount of oil and gas \nthat might be produced and the total amount of new oil \nwells and other infrastructure that might be con-\nstructed in the Basin if the railway was built, using \n\u201cconservative\u201d assumptions that \u201cmay overstate total \nfuture oil production in the Basin.\u201d  J.A. 353; see J.A. \n351-362.  The Board also analyzed the environmental ef-\nfects from that increased oil production on each rele-\nvant resource in the Basin to the extent it could without \nany information regarding specific projects and plans.  \nSee J.A. 365-474.   \n\n8 \n \nThe Board specifically found that there were many \nuncertainties regarding the downstream effects of re-\nfining the oil that would be transported over the line.  \nJ.A. 420-423.  The Board explained that it \u201cgenerally \ncannot restrict the types of products and commodities \nthat are transported on rail lines\u201d and \u201cthat railroads \nhave a common carrier obligation to carry all commodi-\nties, including hazardous materials, upon reasonable re-\nquest under 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 11101.\u201d  J.A. 421.  The Board \nrecognized, however, that much of the oil transported \nout of the Basin on the new line would likely go to refin-\neries and end-users for combustion, which would pro-\nduce emissions that contribute to \u201cglobal warming and \nclimate change.\u201d  J.A. 420.  The Board estimated the ag-\ngregate amount of greenhouse gas emissions from its \nestimation of the potential increase in combustion, us-\ning a set of assumptions that the Board described as \n\u201cconservative\u201d and that \u201cmay overstate\u201d the potential \nemissions.  J.A. 423.  The Board found that its high-end \nestimate would represent approximately 0.8% of nation-\nwide greenhouse gas emissions and 0.1% of global emis-\nsions.  Ibid.   \nc. In an appendix to the final environmental impact \nstatement responding to public comments on the draft \nstatement, the Board addressed comments suggesting \nthat it should have given more detailed consideration to \nthe effects of upstream and downstream oil and gas de-\nvelopment.  J.A. 520-529.  Some commenters had sug-\ngested that the Board \u201cshould have treated potential \nenvironmental impacts that could result from potential \nfuture, as yet unplanned, oil and gas development pro-\njects in the Basin as direct or indirect impacts of the \nproposed rail line, rather than treating [such] projects \n\n9 \n \nas reasonably foreseeable future actions that could con-\ntribute to cumulative impacts.\u201d  J.A. 520. \nIn responding to those comments, the Board ex-\nplained that further analysis of the posited effects \n\u201cwould not inform the Board\u2019s decision on [petitioners\u2019 \nproposal] to construct and operate\u201d the new railroad \nline.  J.A. 521.  The Board observed that a NEPA anal-\nysis has two purposes:  (1) to ensure that, \u201cin reaching \nits decision,\u201d the agency has available and may \u201ccare-\nfully consider[] detailed information concerning signifi-\ncant environmental impacts,\u201d and (2) to \u201cguarantee[] \nthat the relevant information will be made available to \nthe larger audience that may also play a role\u201d in the de-\ncision and its implementation.  Ibid. (quoting Public \nCitizen, 541 U.S. at 768) (citation omitted).   \nThe Board described several reasons that more de-\ntailed information about particular oil and gas develop-\nment that might occur would not serve either of those \npurposes.  J.A. 521-529.  The Board observed that it \n\u201chas jurisdiction over rail transportation by rail carri-\ners,\u201d and that it had prepared the environmental impact \nstatement in connection with its decision \u201cunder 49 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 10502\u201d as to whether to grant petitioners\u2019 re-\nquest \u201cto construct and operate a new rail line\u201d in the \nUinta Basin.  J.A. 522; see ibid. (citing 49 U.S.C. 10501).  \nThe decision before the Board was therefore \u201cwhether \nto authorize, deny, or authorize with conditions\u201d peti-\ntioners\u2019 \u201cproposal to construct and operate the pro-\nposed rail line.\u201d  Ibid.  \u201cOil and gas development [was] \nnot part of\u200a\u201d the proposed agency action before the \nBoard and would be \u201csubject to the approval processes \nof other federal, state, local, and tribal agencies.\u201d  Ibid.  \nThe Board also found that it \u201clack[ed] sufficient con-\ntrol over future oil and gas development projects to \n\n10 \n \nmake those projects part of the proposed action as-\nsessed in the [environmental impact statement].\u201d  J.A. \n523.  The Board acknowledged that \u201cthe availability of \na rail transportation option would benefit the oil and gas \nindustry\u201d in the Basin, but it observed that the \u201cindus-\ntry is already well-established\u201d and that the Board\u2019s au-\nthority to prevent or minimize oil and gas development \nis constrained because the Board \u201ccan only impose con-\nditions that are consistent with its statutory authority \nover rail transportation by rail carriers under the Inter-\nstate Commerce Act.\u201d  Ibid.   \nFurther, the Board explained that the environmental \nconsequences of future oil and gas development in the \nUinta Basin were both \u201cspeculative\u201d and attenuated.  \nJ.A. 525; see J.A. 527-529.  The Board observed that \nmany oil and gas development projects in the Basin had \n\u201cnot yet been proposed or planned.\u201d  J.A. 528.  It further \nobserved that the extent of future oil and gas develop-\nment would involve \u201cmany separate and independent \nprojects\u201d in the Basin that could vary in terms of the \nfederal, state, tribal, or private character of the land, \nand the \u201cscale\u201d and nature of the projects themselves.  \nIbid.  The Board also noted that \u201cit would not be possi-\nble to determine which of these as yet unproposed, un-\nplanned, and unsponsored projects would or would not \nproceed.\u201d  J.A. 528-529.  For all these reasons, the \nBoard found that it was \u201cnot possible to\u201d say that any \nsuch projects were \u201cproximately caused by the pro-\nposed rail line.\u201d  J.A. 529.   \nAs to the downstream consequences of transporting \noil over the proposed line, the Board observed that \n\u201ccrude oil produced in the Basin is currently trans-\nported to refiners in the Salt Lake City area\u201d that have \n\u201climitations on the volume of crude oil\u201d they can accept.  \n\n11 \n \nJ.A. 528.  The Board found that \u201cit is possible that addi-\ntional capacity could be added at those refineries in the \nfuture.\u201d  Ibid.  But the Board observed that refining \nmight increase regardless of the Board\u2019s actions \u201cde-\npend[ing] on future market conditions.\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

A petition for rehearing en banc was \n \n1  The federal respondents supporting petitioners represented by \nthe Solicitor General in this brief include the Surface Transporta-\ntion Board.  Although the Board did not participate at the certiorari \nstage (see Gov\u2019t Br. in Opp. 2 n.1), it was a party before the court of \nappeals and is therefore a respondent in this Court.   \n\n2 \n \ndenied on December 4, 2023 (Pet. App. 72a-73a).  The \npetition for a writ of certiorari was filed on March 4, \n2024, and granted on June 24, 2024.  The jurisdiction of \nthis Court rests on 28 U.S.C. 1254(1) and 2350. \nSTATUTORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED \nPertinent statutory provisions are reproduced in the \nappendix to this brief.  App., infra, 1a-14a.   \nSTATEMENT \n1. Enacted in 1970, the National Environmental Pol-\nicy Act of 1969 (NEPA), Pub. L. No. 91-190, 83 Stat. 852 \n(42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.), establishes a set of \u201c\u200a\u2018action-\nforcing\u2019 procedures that require\u201d agencies to \u201ctake a \n\u2018hard look\u2019 at environmental consequences\u201d before un-\ndertaking major federal actions that will affect the en-\nvironment.  Robertson v. Methow Valley Citizens Coun-\ncil, 490 U.S. 332, 350 (1989) (citation omitted).  Congress \ndeclared that the purpose of those procedural require-\nments is to encourage efforts to \u201cprevent or eliminate \ndamage to the environment\u201d and improve public health \nand welfare, while also enhancing understanding of the \nenvironment. 42 U.S.C. 4321; accord Department of \nTransp. v. Public Citizen, 541 U.S. 752, 756 (2004) \n(quoting 42 U.S.C. 4321); see 42 U.S.C. 4331 (describing \ntenets of the \u201cnational environmental policy\u201d) (empha-\nsis omitted).   \nNEPA\u2019s core procedural provision requires agencies \nto prepare a \u201cdetailed statement\u201d in connection with a \nproposal for \u201cmajor Federal actions significantly affect-\ning the quality of the human environment.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \n4332(2)(C).  As originally enacted, the statute required \nthese environmental impact statements to include  \nanalysis of (among other things) the \u201cenvironmental im-\npact of the proposed action\u201d and any unavoidable \u201cad-\nverse environmental effects\u201d of the proposal.  NEPA  \n\n3 \n \n\u00a7 102(c)(i) and (ii), 83 Stat. 853.  The original statute also \nestablished the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ), \na new entity charged with overseeing the national envi-\nronmental policy the statute pronounced.  42 U.S.C. \n4342.   \nIn a set of 2023 amendments enacted after the \nagency decisions in this case, Congress clarified the ap-\npropriate scope of an environmental impact statement \nby specifying that the statement should analyze the \n\u201creasonably foreseeable environmental effects of the \nproposed agency action.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C)(i); see \nFiscal Responsibility Act of 2023 (2023 Act), Pub. L. No. \n118-5, Div. C, Tit. III, \u00a7 321(a)(3)(B), 137 Stat. 38.  Be-\nfore that amendment, longstanding CEQ regulations \nhad similarly specified that agencies should consider \nthe \u201creasonably foreseeable\u201d environmental effects of \ntheir proposed actions.  43 Fed. Reg. 55,978, 56,004 \n(Nov. 29, 1978) (40 C.F.R. 1508.8(b) (1979)).  In 2020, \nCEQ had revised the regulations to define \u201c[r]easona-\nbly foreseeable\u201d to mean \u201csufficiently likely to occur \nsuch that a person of ordinary prudence would take it \ninto account in reaching a decision.\u201d  85 Fed. Reg. \n43,304, 43,376 (July 16, 2020) (40 C.F.R. 1508.1(aa) (2021)) \n(emphasis omitted).  That definition remains in place to-\nday.  See 40 C.F.R. 1508.1(aa).  \n2. a. The Surface Transportation Board (Board) is \na federal agency that regulates rail carriers and rail-\nroads.  Because the Board is the successor to the Inter-\nstate Commerce Commission, its authority is set out in \nthe ICC Termination Act of 1995 (the Interstate Com-\nmerce Act), Pub. L. No. 104-88, 109 Stat. 803 (49 U.S.C. \n10101 et seq.).   \nThe Interstate Commerce Act grants the Board \u201cex-\nclusive\u201d federal jurisdiction over \u201ctransportation by rail \n\n4 \n \ncarrier[s]\u201d and \u201cthe construction, acquisition, opera-\ntion, abandonment, or discontinuance\u201d of railway lines \nand related facilities.  49 U.S.C. 10501(b)(2).  The Act \nalso charges the Board with enforcing the statute\u2019s \n\u201c[c]ommon-carrier\u201d obligation, which requires railroads \nto carry all commodities upon reasonable request\u2014 \nincluding hazardous and other environmentally-sensitive \nmaterials.  See 49 U.S.C. 11101; Riffin v. Surface Transp. \nBd., 733 F.3d 340, 345-347 (D.C. Cir. 2013); accord Ak-\nron, Canton & Youngstown R.R. v. ICC, 611 F.2d 1162, \n1166-1168 (6th Cir. 1979) (common-carrier railroad \nmust carry nuclear waste), cert. denied, 449 U.S. 830 \n(1980).   \nb. An entity that wishes to construct or operate a \nnew railroad line must generally seek a license from the \nBoard.  49 U.S.C. 10901.  One way to obtain a license is \nto file an application with the Board.  See 49 U.S.C. \n10901(c).  This approach initiates a process that involves \npublic notice and a proceeding to evaluate the applica-\ntion, and the Board is required to \u201cissue a certificate au-\nthorizing\u201d the construction \u201cunless the Board finds that \nsuch activities are inconsistent with the public conven-\nience and necessity.\u201d  Ibid.; see 49 C.F.R. 1151.2.  \nAlternatively, as in this case, an applicant may re-\nquest Board authorization through a more summary \n\u201cexemption\u201d process under 49 U.S.C. 10502.  The Board \nmay grant an exemption when it finds that a full pro-\nceeding under Section 10901 \u201cis not necessary to carry \nout the rail transportation policy of [S]ection 10101\u201d of \nthe Interstate Commerce Act, and that either the \n\u201ctransaction or service is of limited scope\u201d or full pro-\nceedings are \u201cnot needed to protect shippers from the \nabuse of market power.\u201d  49 U.S.C. 10502(a).  Under the \nexemption process, the Board does not apply the \u201cpublic \n\n5 \n \nconvenience and necessity\u201d standard from Section \n10901(c); instead the Board assesses the transportation \nmerits of the construction or operation proposal based \non statutorily enumerated policies for \u201cregulating the \nrailroad industry\u201d set out in 49 U.S.C. 10101.  See 49 \nU.S.C. 10502(a)(1).  The Act provides that \u201cthe Board, \nto the maximum extent consistent with [the Act],\u201d shall \ngrant an exemption when it finds these criteria satis-\nfied.  49 U.S.C. 10502(a).  Under both the application \nand exemption processes, there is a presumption in fa-\nvor of approving rail construction projects. \n3. a. Petitioners seek to construct an 85-mile-long \nrailway line in Utah connecting the Uinta Basin in \nnortheastern Utah to the existing interstate freight rail \nnetwork near Kyune, Utah.  Pet. App. 190a-191a.  Be-\ncause the Basin is surrounded by high mountains and \nplateaus with elevations up to 13,000 feet above sea \nlevel, transportation options are limited.  C.A. App. 259-\n260, 822.  Freight must currently be transported by \ntruck on two-lane highways.  Pet. App. 7a.  A new rail-\nway line would furnish an additional transportation op-\ntion for moving goods into and out of the Basin.  Ibid.  \nAnd because waxy crude oil is the main commodity cur-\nrently transported by trucks in the Uinta Basin, that \nwould be the new line\u2019s primary freight.  Ibid. \nIn May 2020, petitioners sought the Board\u2019s author-\nization for the railway line by invoking the Interstate \nCommerce Act\u2019s exemption process under Section \n10502.  Pet. App. 6a-7a.  The Board conducted the ex-\nemption process in this case through bifurcated pro-\nceedings.  Id. at 9a-11a.  The Board issued a preliminary \ndecision in January 2021 addressing the transportation \nmerits of the proposed project before the Board\u2019s envi-\nronmental analysis was complete, id. at 9a, and then is-\n\n6 \n \nsued a final decision taking account of the completed en-\nvironmental analysis later that same year, id. at 10a-\n11a.   \nb. The environmental analysis involved multiple \nstages.  In October 2020, the Board issued a draft envi-\nronmental impact statement in connection with the pro-\nject.  Pet. App. 10a.  The Board then opened a public com-\nment process that continued until February 12, 2021.  \nDuring that process, the Board conducted six public \nmeetings and received over 1900 comments.  Ibid.  In \nAugust 2021, the Board issued its final environmental \nimpact statement.  Id. at 76a.   \nThe Board\u2019s final environmental impact statement \nspanned more than 600 pages.  It was supported by \nmore than 2200 pages of appendices containing tech-\nnical analysis and other materials, as well as a separate \n728-page document with the Board\u2019s responses to public \ncomments\u2014resulting in more than 3600 pages of analy-\nsis in total.2 \nThe Board\u2019s final environmental impact statement \nidentified and analyzed a series of \u201csignificant and ad-\nverse impacts that could occur as a result of the pro-\nposed rail line.\u201d  J.A. 121.  Those impacts included the \ndisturbance of local \u201cwaters and wetlands\u201d that would \noccur due to the line\u2019s construction, the \u201cwayside noise\u201d \nthat would be created by the trains newly running \nthrough the area, J.A. 123-124, the alterations to land \nuse and recreation, J.A. 124, and the effects on \u201c[t]ribal \n[c]oncerns\u201d\u2014although the Board noted that the tribe \nwhose land is in the Basin supported the project, J.A. \n125-126; see Ute Indian Tribe of the Uintah and Ouray \nReservation Amici Br. (filed Apr. 4, 2024).  The environ-\n \n2 The full statement and appendices are available at http://www. \nuintabasinrailwayeis.com/DocumentsAndLinks.aspx.   \n\n7 \n \nmental impact statement also considered several \u201cmi-\nnor impacts\u201d that \u201cwould not be significant\u201d if certain \nmitigation measures were adopted.  J.A. 126.  Those im-\npacts included \u201cair quality and greenhouse gas[]\u201d emis-\nsions in the area of construction and the effect of the \nnew construction on local big game, fish, and wildlife.  \nJ.A. 132 (capitalization and emphasis omitted); see J.A. \n126-134.  In addition, the statement considered the \n\u201cdownline impacts\u201d that the new railway line would cre-\nate on existing lines by increasing the volume of traffic.  \nJ.A. 134.  And the statement considered the cumulative \nimpacts of the project, addressing the \u201crelevant past, \npresent, and reasonably foreseeable projects and ac-\ntions that could have impacts that coincide in time and \nlocation with the potential impacts of the proposed rail \nline.\u201d  J.A. 135; see J.A. 135-136.  \nAmong the \u201ccumulative impacts\u201d the Board identi-\nfied were the effects of increased oil production in the \nUinta Basin spurred by the increased transportation ca-\npacity for oil furnished by the new railroad line.  J.A. \n135.  Although the Board found that there were many \nunknowns and uncertainties in connection with the con-\nsequences of additional oil and gas development, the \nagency nonetheless estimated the amount of oil and gas \nthat might be produced and the total amount of new oil \nwells and other infrastructure that might be con-\nstructed in the Basin if the railway was built, using \n\u201cconservative\u201d assumptions that \u201cmay overstate total \nfuture oil production in the Basin.\u201d  J.A. 353; see J.A. \n351-362.  The Board also analyzed the environmental ef-\nfects from that increased oil production on each rele-\nvant resource in the Basin to the extent it could without \nany information regarding specific projects and plans.  \nSee J.A. 365-474.   \n\n8 \n \nThe Board specifically found that there were many \nuncertainties regarding the downstream effects of re-\nfining the oil that would be transported over the line.  \nJ.A. 420-423.  The Board explained that it \u201cgenerally \ncannot restrict the types of products and commodities \nthat are transported on rail lines\u201d and \u201cthat railroads \nhave a common carrier obligation to carry all commodi-\nties, including hazardous materials, upon reasonable re-\nquest under 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 11101.\u201d  J.A. 421.  The Board \nrecognized, however, that much of the oil transported \nout of the Basin on the new line would likely go to refin-\neries and end-users for combustion, which would pro-\nduce emissions that contribute to \u201cglobal warming and \nclimate change.\u201d  J.A. 420.  The Board estimated the ag-\ngregate amount of greenhouse gas emissions from its \nestimation of the potential increase in combustion, us-\ning a set of assumptions that the Board described as \n\u201cconservative\u201d and that \u201cmay overstate\u201d the potential \nemissions.  J.A. 423.  The Board found that its high-end \nestimate would represent approximately 0.8% of nation-\nwide greenhouse gas emissions and 0.1% of global emis-\nsions.  Ibid.   \nc. In an appendix to the final environmental impact \nstatement responding to public comments on the draft \nstatement, the Board addressed comments suggesting \nthat it should have given more detailed consideration to \nthe effects of upstream and downstream oil and gas de-\nvelopment.  J.A. 520-529.  Some commenters had sug-\ngested that the Board \u201cshould have treated potential \nenvironmental impacts that could result from potential \nfuture, as yet unplanned, oil and gas development pro-\njects in the Basin as direct or indirect impacts of the \nproposed rail line, rather than treating [such] projects \n\n9 \n \nas reasonably foreseeable future actions that could con-\ntribute to cumulative impacts.\u201d  J.A. 520. \nIn responding to those comments, the Board ex-\nplained that further analysis of the posited effects \n\u201cwould not inform the Board\u2019s decision on [petitioners\u2019 \nproposal] to construct and operate\u201d the new railroad \nline.  J.A. 521.  The Board observed that a NEPA anal-\nysis has two purposes:  (1) to ensure that, \u201cin reaching \nits decision,\u201d the agency has available and may \u201ccare-\nfully consider[] detailed information concerning signifi-\ncant environmental impacts,\u201d and (2) to \u201cguarantee[] \nthat the relevant information will be made available to \nthe larger audience that may also play a role\u201d in the de-\ncision and its implementation.  Ibid. (quoting Public \nCitizen, 541 U.S. at 768) (citation omitted).   \nThe Board described several reasons that more de-\ntailed information about particular oil and gas develop-\nment that might occur would not serve either of those \npurposes.  J.A. 521-529.  The Board observed that it \n\u201chas jurisdiction over rail transportation by rail carri-\ners,\u201d and that it had prepared the environmental impact \nstatement in connection with its decision \u201cunder 49 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 10502\u201d as to whether to grant petitioners\u2019 re-\nquest \u201cto construct and operate a new rail line\u201d in the \nUinta Basin.  J.A. 522; see ibid. (citing 49 U.S.C. 10501).  \nThe decision before the Board was therefore \u201cwhether \nto authorize, deny, or authorize with conditions\u201d peti-\ntioners\u2019 \u201cproposal to construct and operate the pro-\nposed rail line.\u201d  Ibid.  \u201cOil and gas development [was] \nnot part of\u200a\u201d the proposed agency action before the \nBoard and would be \u201csubject to the approval processes \nof other federal, state, local, and tribal agencies.\u201d  Ibid.  \nThe Board also found that it \u201clack[ed] sufficient con-\ntrol over future oil and gas development projects to \n\n10 \n \nmake those projects part of the proposed action as-\nsessed in the [environmental impact statement].\u201d  J.A. \n523.  The Board acknowledged that \u201cthe availability of \na rail transportation option would benefit the oil and gas \nindustry\u201d in the Basin, but it observed that the \u201cindus-\ntry is already well-established\u201d and that the Board\u2019s au-\nthority to prevent or minimize oil and gas development \nis constrained because the Board \u201ccan only impose con-\nditions that are consistent with its statutory authority \nover rail transportation by rail carriers under the Inter-\nstate Commerce Act.\u201d  Ibid.   \nFurther, the Board explained that the environmental \nconsequences of future oil and gas development in the \nUinta Basin were both \u201cspeculative\u201d and attenuated.  \nJ.A. 525; see J.A. 527-529.  The Board observed that \nmany oil and gas development projects in the Basin had \n\u201cnot yet been proposed or planned.\u201d  J.A. 528.  It further \nobserved that the extent of future oil and gas develop-\nment would involve \u201cmany separate and independent \nprojects\u201d in the Basin that could vary in terms of the \nfederal, state, tribal, or private character of the land, \nand the \u201cscale\u201d and nature of the projects themselves.  \nIbid.  The Board also noted that \u201cit would not be possi-\nble to determine which of these as yet unproposed, un-\nplanned, and unsponsored projects would or would not \nproceed.\u201d  J.A. 528-529.  For all these reasons, the \nBoard found that it was \u201cnot possible to\u201d say that any \nsuch projects were \u201cproximately caused by the pro-\nposed rail line.\u201d  J.A. 529.   \nAs to the downstream consequences of transporting \noil over the proposed line, the Board observed that \n\u201ccrude oil produced in the Basin is currently trans-\nported to refiners in the Salt Lake City area\u201d that have \n\u201climitations on the volume of crude oil\u201d they can accept.  \n\n11 \n \nJ.A. 528.  The Board found that \u201cit is possible that addi-\ntional capacity could be added at those refineries in the \nfuture.\u201d  Ibid.  But the Board observed that refining \nmight increase regardless of the Board\u2019s actions \u201cde-\npend[ing] on future market conditions.\u201d  Ibid.   \nThe Board\u2019s response to the comments did not dis-\ncuss particular refineries in other locations, such as the \nTexas and Louisiana Gulf Coasts and Puget Sound, to \nwhich oil from the Basin might ultimately be shipped.  \nBut the environmental impact statement acknowledged \nthe possibility of increased refining in those areas.  J.A. \n477-482.  The Board determined in the statement that \nmuch of the oil would likely be transported to \u201cmarkets \nin other regions of the United States,\u201d J.A. 477, and to \nthe Gulf Coast and Puget Sound areas in particular, J.A. \n478, but the Board observed that \u201c[t]he final destina-\ntions of the trains would depend on the ability and will-\ningness of refineries in other markets to receive rail \ncars carrying Uinta Basin crude oil and process the oil \nin their refineries.\u201d J.A. 477.  Still, the Board prepared \nestimates of how much potential oil development in the \nUinta Basin might increase transportation of oil to the \nGulf Coast and Puget Sound.  J.A. 481-482.   \nd. Ultimately, the Board\u2019s final decision authorized \nconstruction and operation of the proposed railroad \nline.  Pet. App. 74a-123a.  The Board\u2019s final decision re-\nviewed the environmental effects described in the final \nenvironmental impact statement at length.  See id. at \n83a-117a.   \nIn addressing the upstream and downstream conse-\nquences of oil and gas development, the Board reaf-\nfirmed its prior analysis.  Pet. App. 105a-108a.  The \nBoard explained that it had \u201cestimated aggregate emis-\nsions from potential future oil and gas development \n\n12 \n \nbased on the best available information regarding emis-\nsions from oil and gas production in the Basin.\u201d  Id. at \n106a.  It further acknowledged that, \u201c[t]o the extent \nthat\u201d crude oil transported on the line \u201cwould be com-\nbusted to produce energy, emissions from the combus-\ntion of the fuels would produce\u201d greenhouse gasses, \nwhich could represent \u201cup to approximately 0.8% of na-\ntionwide\u201d emissions and 0.1% of global emissions.  Ibid.  \nBut the Board found that \u201cthe actual volumes of crude \noil that would move over the Line would depend on var-\nious independent variables and influences, including \ngeneral domestic and global economic conditions, com-\nmodity pricing, the strategic and capital investment de-\ncisions of oil producers, and future market demand for \ncrude oil from the Basin,  * * *  among other factors.\u201d  \nIbid.   \nThe Board rejected the contention that it had given \ninsufficient consideration to the upstream and down-\nstream effects of oil production and refining.  Pet. App. \n107a.  The Board reiterated that it \u201chas no authority or \njurisdiction over development of oil and gas in the Basin \nnor any authority to control or mitigate the impacts of \nany such development.\u201d  Id. at 108a.  And it repeated \nthat \u201c[o]il and gas development that may occur follow-\ning authorization of [the new railroad line] would entail \nmany separate and independent projects that have not \nyet been proposed or planned and that could occur on \nprivate, state, tribal, or federal land and could range in \nscale from a single vertical oil well to a large lease.\u201d  \nIbid.   \nIn the end, the Board recognized that the new rail-\nroad line was \u201clikely to produce unavoidable environ-\nmental impacts,\u201d but it found that it could impose \u201cex-\ntensive mitigation conditions\u201d to \u201cminimize those im-\n\n13 \n \npacts to the extent practicable.\u201d  Pet. App. 118a-119a.  \nIt also determined that \u201cconstruction and operation of\u201d \nthe new line would \u201chave substantial transportation and \neconomic benefits\u201d that outweighed the environmental \nconcerns.  Id. at 119a.   \n4. Eagle County, Colorado and several environmen-\ntal organizations (collectively, the \u201cnon-federal re-\nspondents\u201d) filed petitions for review of the Board\u2019s de-\ncision that were consolidated into a single proceeding \nbefore the court of appeals.  See Pet. App. 9a, 13a.  The \ncourt granted the petitions in part and denied them in \npart.  Id. at 1a-71a.   \nAs relevant here, the court of appeals held that the \nBoard\u2019s environmental impact statement improperly \nexcluded further analysis of the upstream environmen-\ntal effects of increased oil production in the Basin and \nthe localized downstream effects of ultimately pro-\ncessing some of that oil in refineries in Texas and Loui-\nsiana.  Pet. App. 28a-37a.  The court first rejected the \nargument that the Board\u2019s NEPA analysis was invalid \nbecause the Board classified the upstream and down-\nstream consequences of oil and gas development as \u201ccu-\nmulative\u201d rather than \u201cindirect\u201d effects.  Id. at 28a-29a.  \nThe court reasoned that \u201c[e]ven if the Board errone-\nously characterized the impacts,\u201d the challengers had \n\u201cidentif[ied] no way in which this decision materially af-\nfected the Board\u2019s analysis under NEPA.\u201d  Ibid.  The \nBoard had both \u201cacknowledged the impact of increased \noil extraction in the Basin and explained [that] \u2018[t]he im-\npacts and the analysis of those impacts would be the \nsame no matter which label [it] used.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Id. at 29a (quot-\ning id. at 108a & n.15 (Final Exemption Decision)) (first \nset of brackets in original).  The court therefore con-\ncluded that the purported misclassification of the ef-\n\n14 \n \nfects could not \u201cbe said \u2018to undermine informed public \ncomment and informed decisionmaking.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Id. at 29a-\n30a (citation omitted). \nThe court of appeals agreed, however, with the non-\nfederal respondents\u2019 argument that the Board had \nfailed to justify the absence of further analysis of the \nalleged upstream and downstream consequences of oil \nand gas development in the environmental impact state-\nment.  Pet. App. 30a-37a.  The court concluded that the \nBoard\u2019s limited discussion of those harms could not be \njustified either on the ground that the upstream and \ndownstream consequences were not \u201creasonably fore-\nseeable,\u201d or on the ground that the Board lacked the \nstatutory authority to prevent those consequences.  Id. \nat 30a-31a (citation omitted).    \nAs to reasonable foreseeability, the court of appeals \nheld that the agency could not rely on its \u201c\u200a\u2018lack of infor-\nmation about the\u2019 location of future oil production sites\u201d \nin the Basin and the \u201c\u200a\u2018destination and end use of the \n[oil]\u2019\u200a\u201d after it was transported over the proposed line \nand entered onto existing lines.  Pet. App. 32a (citation \nomitted; brackets in original).  The court stated that, \nwhile \u201cgreat \u2018deference [is] owed to [the Board\u2019s] tech-\nnical judgments,\u2019\u200a\u201d the Board had \u201cfail[ed] to adequately \nexplain why it could not employ \u2018some degree of fore-\ncasting\u2019 to identify the aforementioned upstream and \ndownstream impacts.\u201d  Id. at 35a (citation omitted; first \nand second set of brackets in original).  \nThe court of appeals then rejected the contention \nthat, under this Court\u2019s decision in Public Citizen, su-\npra, the Board was not required to \u201cidentify and de-\nscribe the environmental effects of increased oil drilling \nand refining\u201d because of the Board\u2019s view that it \u201clack[ed] \nauthority to prevent, control, or mitigate those develop-\n\n15 \n \nments.\u201d  Pet. App. 36a.  The court reasoned that the \nBoard had the authority to prevent those effects be-\ncause the Board has \u201cexclusive jurisdiction over the \nconstruction and operation of the railway, including au-\nthority to deny the exemption petition if the environ-\nmental harm caused by the railway outweighs its trans-\nportation benefits.\u201d  Ibid. (citing 49 U.S.C. 10501(c), \n10901(b)).  The court also reasoned that the Board \u201cis \nauthorized to license railroad construction and opera-\ntion based on the \u2018public convenience and necessity,\u2019 \nwhich encompasses reasonably foreseeable environ-\nmental harms.\u201d  Id. at 37a (citation omitted).  Based on \nthat analysis, the court decided that \u201cthe Board\u2019s argu-\nment that it need not consider effects it cannot prevent\u201d \nwas \u201csimply inapplicable.\u201d  Ibid.   \nThe court of appeals found a number of other flaws \nin the Board\u2019s NEPA analysis, including a failure to \ntake a hard look at the increased risk of rail accidents \ndownline of the 85 miles of new line, Pet. App. 40a-42a, \nthe risk and impacts of wildfires downline caused by \nsparks from the operation of additional trains, id. at \n42a-45a, and the railway\u2019s impacts on water resources \ndownline on the Colorado River, id. at 46a-47a.  The \ncourt rejected or declined to reach multiple other chal-\nlenges under NEPA and the National Historic Preser-\nvation Act.  Id. at 29a, 37a-39a, 47a-50a, 55a-57a.  And \nthe court found that there were flaws in the biological \nopinion that the Fish and Wildlife Service had provided \nin connection with the project under the Endangered \nSpecies Act, id. at 50a-55a, and in the Board\u2019s exemp-\ntion decision under the Interstate Commerce Act, id. at \n57a-69a.  Petitioners did not seek review of those other \nissues.  \n\n16 \n \nBased on the errors the court of appeals found in the \nNEPA analysis and the biological opinion, the \u201cfail[ure] \nto conduct a reasoned application\u201d of the Interstate \nCommerce Act, and the Board\u2019s \u201cfail[ure] to weigh the \n[railway\u2019s] uncertain financial viability and the full po-\ntential for environmental harm against the transporta-\ntion benefits,\u201d the court vacated the Board\u2019s exemption \norder as arbitrary and capricious, and partially vacated \nthe environmental impact statement and biological \nopinion.  Pet. App. 70a; see id. at 70a-71a.   \n5. Petitioners sought rehearing en banc, which the \ncourt of appeals denied.  Pet. App. 72a-73a.   \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nNEPA did not require the Board to undertake addi-\ntional analysis of the upstream and downstream conse-\nquences of oil and gas development in determining \nwhether to authorize the construction and operation of \nthe proposed railroad line in this case.  The court of ap-\npeals\u2019 contrary decision on that issue should be re-\nversed. \nA. \u201cNEPA declares a broad national commitment to \nprotecting and promoting environmental quality.\u201d  Rob-\nertson v. Methow Valley Citizens Council, 490 U.S. 332, \n348 (1989).  But it is \u201cwell settled that NEPA itself does \nnot mandate particular results.\u201d  Id. at 350.  Rather, the \nstatute realizes its environmental policy goals\u2014i.e., \n\u201cencourag[ing] productive and enjoyable harmony be-\ntween man and his environment,\u201d \u201cpromot[ing] efforts \nwhich will prevent or eliminate damage to the environ-\nment,\u201d and \u201cenrich[ing] the understanding of the eco-\nlogical systems and natural resources important to  \nthe Nation,\u201d 42 U.S.C. 4321\u2014through \u201ca set of \u2018action-\nforcing\u2019 procedures that require\u201d agencies to \u201ctake a \n\u200a\u2018hard look\u2019 at environmental consequences,\u201d Robertson, \n\n17 \n \n490 U.S. at 350 (citation omitted).  At the heart of \nNEPA\u2019s procedural mandates is the requirement that \nagencies must prepare a \u201cdetailed statement\u201d analyzing \n\u201cenvironmental effects\u201d before undertaking \u201cmajor \nFederal actions significantly affecting the quality of the \nhuman environment.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C).   \nNEPA\u2019s core procedural mandate is subject to cer-\ntain limits.  Longstanding CEQ regulations, now codi-\nfied in the statute, provide that an agency need only ex-\namine the \u201creasonably foreseeable\u201d effects of a pro-\nposed action.  See 2023 Act, \u00a7 321(a)(3)(B), 137 Stat. 38; \n40 C.F.R. 1508.8(b) (1979).  In addition, this Court has \nstressed that NEPA does not rely on a \u201cbut-for\u201d stand-\nard of causation; rather, an agency is only required to \nexamine the effects for which the agency\u2019s action is the \n\u201clegally relevant cause.\u201d  Department of Transp. v. \nPublic Citizen, 541 U.S. 752, 769 (2004).  That causal \nlimit permits an agency to exclude from its analysis any \neffects the agency \u201chas no ability to prevent  * * *  due \nto its limited statutory authority over the relevant ac-\ntions.\u201d  Id. at 770. \nMoreover, even where an agency\u2019s statutory author-\nity is not so strictly limited, the agency may take ac-\ncount of a variety of context-specific factors in deter-\nmining whether and to what extent the proposed agency \naction is the \u201clegally relevant cause\u201d of a particular \nharm.  Public Citizen, 541 U.S. at 769.  Thus, an agency \nmay reasonably determine that\u2014based on the scope of \nthe proposed action and the nature and reach of the \nagency\u2019s organic statutes\u2014a harm is so attenuated, \nspeculative, contingent, or otherwise insufficiently ma-\nterial to the agency\u2019s decisionmaking that the necessary \ncausal connection is absent or diminished.  Id. at 767.  \nAnd the fact that other governmental entities authorize, \n\n18 \n \nfund, or carry out the specific conduct that gives rise to \nthe environmental issues may likewise inform an agen-\ncy\u2019s determination that the requisite \u201creasonably close \ncausal relationship\u201d between its own actions and partic-\nular harms is missing or less robust.  Ibid. (citation \nomitted).  In these various circumstances, the agency \nmay draw a \u201cmanageable line\u201d that excludes any analy-\nsis of a harm if a \u201creasonably close causal relationship\u201d \nis absent or that minimizes the analysis of a harm where \nthe causal connection is less robust.  Ibid. (citation omit-\nted).   \nB. That does not mean that an agency may impose \nartificial restrictions on its NEPA analysis.  An agency \nmay not, for example, exclude consideration of an effect \nmerely because the agency does not directly regulate it \nor because other agencies share regulatory authority in \nthe relevant arena.  Nor may an agency impose arbi-\ntrary bright-line limits based on rigid measures of geo-\ngraphic distance, the timing of an effect, or the number \nof other actors that may contribute to it.  And agencies \ncannot apply the same tort-law standards of proximate \ncause given NEPA\u2019s different purposes and framework.  \nAgencies must instead draw context-specific causal \nlines that accord with \u201cthe underlying policies behind \nNEPA and Congress\u2019 intent, as informed by the \u2018rule of \nreason.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Public Citizen, 541 U.S. at 768.   \nC. In this case, the Board drew a reasonable line in \ndeclining to undertake more detailed analysis of the up-\nstream and downstream effects of oil and gas develop-\nment in its environmental impact statement supporting \nthe authorization of a new railroad line from the Uinta \nBasin.  The Board authorizes railroad construction and \noperation, not the development and use of the commod-\nities that travel over those lines.  Indeed, the Board is \n\n19 \n \nrequired to enforce a common-carrier obligation that \ngenerally prohibits carriers from declining to provide \ntransport based on the nature of the commodity.  And \nother entities, including in some instances other federal \nagencies, have the authority to approve oil and gas de-\nvelopment projects in the Uinta Basin and to regulate \nthe localized effects of refining at the place where oil \nfrom the Basin might ultimately be transported.   \nGiven this statutory framework, the Board explained \nthat the scope of the proposed action was properly char-\nacterized as a decision to permit the construction of a \nnew railroad line providing common carrier service, ra-\nther than a decision to approve new oil and gas develop-\nment.  The Board also cited many factors that estab-\nlished that the \u201cenvironmental impacts that could po-\ntentially result from potential future oil and gas devel-\nopment projects\u201d were speculative, contingent, and at-\ntenuated from the Board\u2019s proposed action.  J.A. 529.    \nThe Board therefore made a reasonable determina-\ntion not to undertake additional or more detailed analy-\nsis of the upstream and downstream consequences of oil \nand gas development.  J.A. 520-529.  Because that de-\ntermination was not arbitrary or capricious, the court of \nappeals erred in setting it aside, and the court\u2019s decision \non this issue should be reversed.   \nARGUMENT \nTHE SURFACE TRANSPORTATION BOARD REASONA-\nBLY LIMITED ITS CONSIDERATION OF THE UPSTREAM \nAND DOWNSTREAM EFFECTS OF PETITIONERS\u2019 PRO-\nPOSED RAIL LINE \nNEPA embodies a \u201cnational commitment to protect-\ning and promoting environmental quality,\u201d imple-\nmented primarily through a procedural requirement for \nagencies to analyze the significant environmental ef-\n\n20 \n \nfects of their major actions.  Robertson v. Methow Val-\nley Citizens Council, 490 U.S. 332, 348 (1989).  Agencies \nmust adhere to NEPA\u2019s procedural command, but the \nstatutory text, this Court\u2019s precedents, and CEQ\u2019s reg-\nulations all recognize that, in preparing its environmen-\ntal impact statement, an agency has considerable lati-\ntude and may draw manageable, context-specific lines \nthat take into account whether and to what extent \nharms have a reasonably close causal relationship to the \nagency\u2019s action and are sufficiently material to the \nagency\u2019s decisionmaking to further NEPA\u2019s purposes.  \nThe agency\u2019s factual findings and exercise of its expert \njudgment and discretion in determining the scope of its \nenvironmental impact statement may be set aside only \nif they are arbitrary and capricious.  See, e.g., Depart-\nment of Transp. v. Public Citizen, 541 U.S. 752, 763 \n(2004); Marsh v. Oregon Natural Res. Council, 490 U.S. \n360, 375-376 (1989). \nIn determining the scope of their environmental \nanalyses, agencies may not impose categorical or artifi-\ncial limits that exclude information about environmen-\ntal harms that have a reasonably close causal connection \nand would materially assist the agency in its decision-\nmaking or the public in providing meaningful input.  But \nin this case, the Board did not rely on any such arbitrary \nlimits.  Rather, the Board relied on several context- \nspecific factors to conclude that the upstream and \ndownstream consequences of oil and gas development \nwere too attenuated, speculative, contingent, and other-\nwise insufficiently material to the Board\u2019s decisionmak-\ning to warrant additional consideration in the environ-\nmental impact statement.  The Board\u2019s decision was not \narbitrary and capricious, and the court of appeals erred \nin holding otherwise.   \n\n21 \n \nA. NEPA Permits Agencies To Draw Manageable, Context-\nSpecific Lines In Determining The Scope of Their Envi-\nronmental Impact Statements \nWhen Congress first enacted NEPA in 1970, it re-\nquired agencies to prepare \u201cdetailed statement[s]\u201d ana-\nlyzing \u201cthe environmental impact of\u200a\u201d a proposed major \nfederal action, as well as (among other things) \u201cany ad-\nverse environmental effects which c[ould not] be avoided \nshould the proposal be implemented.\u201d  \u00a7102(c)(i) and \n(ii); 83 Stat. 853 (42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C)(i) and (ii) (1970)).  \nCongress did not define the terms \u201cenvironmental im-\npact\u201d or \u201cenvironmental effect[].\u201d  Ibid.  But this Court\u2019s \nprecedents, longstanding practice, and recent NEPA \namendments establish that agencies need only consider \nthe reasonably foreseeable environmental consequences \nfor which the agency action is a \u201clegally relevant cause.\u201d  \nPublic Citizen, 541 U.S. at 769; see 42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C) \n(requiring a \u201cdetailed statement by the responsible of-\nficial on\u2014(i) reasonably foreseeable environmental ef-\nfects of the proposed agency action\u201d).  Moreover, an \nagency\u2019s determination regarding the scope of its envi-\nronmental analysis is necessarily informed by NEPA\u2019s \npurposes and its \u201crule of reason,\u201d as well as the nature \nand scope of the agency\u2019s substantive authority.  And \nthe determination is reviewed under the APA\u2019s defer-\nential \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d standard.   \nUnder those principles, an agency may draw a man-\nageable, context-specific line that differentiates be-\ntween (1) the significant environmental harms for which \nthe agency\u2019s action is the legally relevant cause and \nwhich will inform the agency\u2019s decisionmaking and the \npublic\u2019s input, and (2) the potential harms that are more \nattenuated, speculative, contingent, or otherwise insuf-\nficiently material to the agency\u2019s decisionmaking, such \n\n22 \n \nthat their consideration is less likely to serve NEPA\u2019s \npurposes or satisfy its rule of reason.  For harms in the \nlatter category, the reasonably close causal connection \nmay be missing entirely, such that the agency need not \nconsider the harm at all, or the connection may be suf-\nficiently removed that the agency may give the harm \nonly limited consideration. \n1.  NEPA plainly requires that an effect be \u201creason-\nably foreseeable\u201d in order to necessitate inclusion in an \nenvironmental impact statement.  CEQ regulations have \nlong provided that agencies should consider the \u201crea-\nsonably foreseeable\u201d environmental effects of their pro-\nposed actions.  43 Fed. Reg. at 56,004; 40 C.F.R. 1508.8(b) \n(2019).  In 2020, CEQ amended its regulations to clarify \nthat \u201c[r]easonably foreseeable\u201d means \u201csufficiently \nlikely to occur such that a person of ordinary prudence \nwould take it into account in reaching a decision.\u201d  85 \nFed. Reg. 43,304, 43,376 (July 16, 2020) (40 C.F.R. \n1508.1(aa) (2021)) (emphasis omitted); see 40 C.F.R. \n1508.1(ii) (2024) (same).  And in 2023, Congress codified \nthis requirement by amending NEPA to specify that  \nan agency must examine the \u201creasonably foreseeable \nenvironmental effects of the proposed agency action.\u201d  \n42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C)(i); see 2023 Act \u00a7321(a)(3)(B), 137 \nStat. 38.   \nNEPA also permits agencies to refrain from analyz-\ning an effect for which the agency\u2019s action is not the \u201cle-\ngally relevant cause.\u201d  Public Citizen, 541 U.S. at 769.  \nThus, in Metropolitan Edison Co. v. People Against \nNuclear Energy, 460 U.S. 766 (1983), the Court held \nthat NEPA does not incorporate a standard of \u201c\u200a\u2018but for\u2019 \ncausation.\u201d  Id. at 774.  Rather, the term \u201c\u200a\u2018environmen-\ntal effect\u2019\u200a\u201d must \u201cbe read to include a requirement of a \nreasonably close causal relationship between a change \n\n23 \n \nin the physical environment and the effect at issue.\u201d  \nIbid.  The Court reiterated that principle in Public Cit-\nizen, holding that \u201ca \u2018but for\u2019 causal relationship is in-\nsufficient to make an agency responsible for a particular \neffect under NEPA and the relevant regulations.\u201d  541 \nU.S. at 767.  And the Court explained that it is neces-\nsary to look at NEPA\u2019s \u201cunderlying policies or legisla-\ntive intent in order to draw a manageable line between \nthose causal changes that may make an actor responsi-\nble for an effect and those that do not.\u201d  Ibid. (quoting \nMetropolitan Edison, 460 U.S. at 774 n.7).   \nThere is considerable overlap among these princi-\nples.  Reasonable foreseeability plays an important role \nin many statutory causation standards.  See, e.g., CSX \nTransp., Inc. v. McBride, 564 U.S. 685, 703 (2011) (dis-\ncussing the role of reasonable foreseeability for deter-\nmining causation under the Federal Employers\u2019 Liabil-\nity Act, 45 U.S.C. 51 et seq.).  And Congress\u2019s recent \namendments to NEPA confirm that agencies must look \nto whether a consequence is \u201creasonably foreseeable,\u201d \n42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C)(i), in drawing the \u201cmanageable \nline\u201d that Metropolitan Edison and Public Citizen con-\ntemplate, Public Citizen, 541 U.S. at 767.3  But the re-\n \n3  The overlap is also reflected in CEQ\u2019s 2022 amendments remov-\ning the term \u201creasonably close causal connection\u201d from its NEPA \nregulations.  CEQ had added that term, drawn from the Court\u2019s \nopinions in Metropolitan Edison and Public Citizen, for the first \ntime in 2020 to clarify that agencies may look to the attenuated na-\nture of an effect in determining the appropriate scope of their \nNEPA analyses.  See 85 Fed. Reg. at 43,343-43,344.  When CEQ \nsubsequently removed that term from the regulations in 2022, it ex-\nplained that it was not disregarding \u201can agency\u2019s ability to exclude \neffects too attenuated from its actions.\u201d  87 Fed. Reg. 23, 453, 23,465 \n(Apr. 20, 2022).  Rather, CEQ indicated that the requirement of a \n \n\n24 \n \nquirements of reasonable foreseeability and causation \nare not identical.  For example, Public Citizen recog-\nnized that, even when an environmental harm is \u201crea-\nsonably foreseeable\u201d in the abstract or as a factual mat-\nter, id. at 766 (citation omitted), NEPA\u2019s causation \nstandard is not met if the agency \u201chas no ability to pre-\nvent\u201d the harm \u201cdue to its limited statutory authority \nover the relevant actions,\u201d id. at 770.   \nIn Public Citizen, the Court considered whether an \nagency had permissibly excluded certain environmental \neffects from its NEPA analysis based on the agency\u2019s \nlimited statutory mandate.  541 U.S. at 767.  The case \ninvolved a NEPA challenge to safety regulations for \nMexican trucks that the Federal Motor Carrier Safety \nAdministration (FMCSA) promulgated after the Presi-\ndent decided to lift a moratorium on the entry of Mexi-\ncan trucks.  Id. at 756, 760.  The agency\u2019s NEPA analy-\nsis considered the environmental consequences of the \nroadside inspections of the Mexican trucks required by \nthe agency\u2019s new safety rules.  Id. at 761.  But the anal-\nysis did not consider the consequences of the increased \npresence of Mexican trucks in the United States be-\ncause FMCSA determined that the increased presence \nwas due to the President\u2019s decision to lift the morato-\nrium rather than the agency\u2019s new regulations.  Ibid.   \nSeveral challengers asserted that limiting the NEPA \nanalysis in that way was improper because the trucks \n \n\u201creasonably close causal connection\u201d was already captured by the \npre-2020 regulation\u2019s longstanding principle of \u201creasonable foresee-\nability,\u201d ibid., and the requirement that effects must be caused by \nthe agency.  Deleting the phrase that had been added by the 2020 \nregulations did not affect the courts\u2019 ability to consider whether \nthere is a \u201creasonably close causal connection\u201d between the agency\u2019s \naction and a particular harm in reviewing whether an agency acted \narbitrarily and capriciously in declining to assess that harm.     \n\n25 \n \ncould not enter the United States until the agency \npromulgated its regulations.  Public Citizen, 541 U.S. \nat 765-766.  In the challengers\u2019 view, that made FMSCA \nthe \u201ccause\u200a\u201d of the entry of Mexican trucks.  Id. at 766.  \nBecause the President\u2019s lifting of the moratorium and \nthe entry of the trucks were also \u201creasonably foreseea-\nble,\u201d the challengers argued that NEPA required the \nagency to consider the environmental consequences of \nthe trucks\u2019 entry.  Ibid. (citation omitted).   \nThe Court rejected that argument, holding that \nNEPA does not require the \u201cunyielding variation of \u2018but \nfor\u2019 causation\u201d the challengers had proposed.  Public \nCitizen, 541 U.S. at 767.  Instead, agencies may draw \ncausal lines based on \u201cthe underlying policies behind \nNEPA and Congress\u2019 intent, as informed by the \u2018rule of \nreason\u2019\u200a\u201d inherent in the statute.  Id. at 768.  That \u201c\u200a\u2018rule \nof reason,\u2019\u200a\u201d the Court explained, \u201censures that agencies \ndetermine whether and to what extent to prepare an \n[environmental impact statement] based on the useful-\nness of any new potential information to the deci-\nsionmaking process.\u201d  Id. at 767.  And the \u201crule of rea-\nson\u201d is not satisfied where consideration of a particular \nenvironmental harm would not serve NEPA\u2019s goals of \nproviding information to the agency to assist in its deci-\nsional process and to the public to enable it to offer \nmeaningful input.  Ibid. \nApplying those principles in Public Citizen, the \nCourt held that FMSCA could not be considered the \u201cle-\ngally relevant cause\u201d of the increased presence of Mex-\nican trucks and their attendant emissions in the United \nStates.  541 U.S. at 769.  The Court explained that \nFMSCA had no \u201cability to countermand the President\u2019s \nlifting of the moratorium or otherwise categorically to \nexclude Mexican motor carriers from operating within \n\n26 \n \nthe United States.\u201d  Id. at 766.  To the contrary, the \nCourt explained, it would \u201cviolate\u201d the agency\u2019s statu-\ntory mandate for FMCSA to refuse to authorize opera-\ntions by a Mexican motor carrier that was \u201cwilling and \nable to comply with\u201d FMCSA\u2019s safety regulations based \non concerns about the trucks\u2019 emissions, and thus to \npreclude the trucks\u2019 entry altogether.  Ibid.  In those \ncircumstances, the Court determined that FMSCA\u2019s ac-\ntions were not the \u201clegally relevant cause\u201d of any in-\ncreased emissions from the trucks, and explained that \nrequiring the agency to consider information about any \nincrease in emissions would not satisfy NEPA\u2019s \u201crule of \nreason\u201d or its statutory purposes because the agency \nwas powerless to act on that information.  Id. at 767-769.  \n2.  Public Citizen establishes that, even when an en-\nvironmental harm might be \u201creasonably foreseeable,\u201d it \nmay still be excluded from an environmental impact \nstatement where the agency lacks the ability to prevent \nthe harm.  In those instances, the requisite \u201ccausal con-\nnection\u201d is missing, and the environmental harm cannot \nbe considered an \u201cimpact\u201d or \u201ceffect\u201d of the agency\u2019s ac-\ntion for purposes of NEPA.  Public Citizen, 541 U.S. at \n768.  That is clearly the case where, as in Public Citizen, \nthe governing statutes prohibit the agency from taking \nthe action necessary to stop the relevant harm from oc-\ncurring.  Id. at 769-770.  And it is also the case where \nthe decisions that give rise to the relevant effect are \ncommitted to the exclusive control of another agency.  \nSee Sierra Club v. FERC, 827 F.3d 36, 47 (D.C. Cir. \n2016) (finding that the Federal Energy Regulatory \nCommission was not required \u201cto address the indirect \neffects of the anticipated export of natural gas\u201d as part \nof its NEPA analysis of the authorization of new natural \ngas facilities because \u201cthe Department of Energy, not \n\n27 \n \nthe Commission, has sole authority to license the export \nof any natural gas going through the [new] facilities\u201d) \n(emphasis omitted).4  \nBut Public Citizen\u2019s reasoning indicates that an \nagency may also find that the requisite causal connec-\ntion is absent or diminished where the scope of the \nagency action and the nature and requirements of the \ngoverning statutes render a particular harm too atten-\nuated, speculative, contingent, or otherwise insuffi-\nciently material to the agency decision under consider-\nation.  Where an agency makes such a reasonable,  \ncontext-specific determination, the agency is entitled to \n\u201cdraw a manageable line\u201d that excludes any considera-\ntion of harms where a \u201creasonably close causal connec-\ntion\u201d is absent, or that appropriately limits the analysis \nof harms where the causal connection is simply less ro-\nbust.  Public Citizen, 541 U.S. at 767 (citations omitted).  \nNEPA\u2019s \u201cunderlying policies\u201d are not served by addi-\ntional analysis of a harm that is too attenuated, specu-\nlative, or contingent to influence the agency\u2019s deci-\nsionmaking or to provide \u201c\u200a\u2018a springboard\u2019\u200a\u201d for mean-\ningful public comments.  Id. at 768 (citation omitted).  \nAnd it would not \u201csatisfy NEPA\u2019s \u2018rule of reason\u2019 to re-\n \n4  In their certiorari-stage briefing, petitioners asserted (Pet. 24-\n25) that CEQ\u2019s recent amendments to its NEPA regulations have \ninappropriately narrowed the scope of Public Citizen by disregard-\ning the proposition that an agency may exclude environmental ef-\nfects that it has no power to prevent.  In fact, in the preamble to its \n2022 revisions to the NEPA regulations, CEQ merely explained that \nthe Court\u2019s description of the causation issue in Public Citizen was \nnecessarily informed by the particular context of the case, in which \nthe agency was affirmatively barred by statute from acting on the \nbasis of the alleged environmental harm.  CEQ\u2019s discussion was not \nintended to place limits on an agency\u2019s discretion beyond those im-\nposed by the statute itself.  See 87 Fed. Reg. at 23,464-23,465.   \n\n28 \n \nquire an agency to\u201d analyze a harm when it has con-\ncluded that the harm is too far afield from the agency\u2019s \naction to make \u201cany new potential information\u201d useful \nto the agency\u2019s \u201cdecisionmaking process.\u201d  Id. at 767, \n769.   \n3.  This Court\u2019s cases regarding the standard of judi-\ncial review of the scope of an environmental impact \nstatement further establish that agencies are afforded \nconsiderable latitude and discretion in determining the \nbounds of their NEPA analyses based on these consid-\nerations.  The Court has repeatedly recognized that an \nagency\u2019s decision about whether and how to prepare an \nenvironmental impact statement \u201ccan be set aside only \nupon a showing that it was \u2018arbitrary, capricious, an \nabuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with \nlaw.\u2019\u200a\u201d Public Citizen, 541 U.S. at 763 (quoting 5 U.S.C. \n706(2)(A)); see, e.g., Marsh, 490 U.S. at 375.  The Court \nhas also stressed that a reviewing court should not treat \nan agency\u2019s factual determination regarding whether \nan environmental effect requires additional analysis as \na \u201clegal question\u201d subject to searching review.  Marsh, \n490 U.S. at 376.  A \u201ccourt need only decide whether the \nagency decision was \u2018arbitrary and capricious.\u2019\u200a\u201d Id. at \n375.  And under that standard, a court should not reject \nan agency\u2019s decision unless the agency has made a \n\u201c\u200a\u2018clear error of judgment,\u2019\u200a\u201d even if the court believes \nthat \u201canother decisionmaker might have reached a con-\ntrary result.\u201d  Id. at 385.   \nIn Kleppe v. Sierra Club, 427 U.S. 390 (1976), for ex-\nample, the Court held that \u201c[a]bsent a showing of arbi-\ntrary action,\u201d a reviewing court \u201cmust assume\u201d that the \nagency has \u201cexercised [its] discretion appropriately\u201d in \ndeciding the scope of its environmental impact state-\nment.  Id. at 412.  In considering the environmental im-\n\n29 \n \npacts at issue in that case, including the \u201c[d]iminished \navailability of water, air and water pollution, increases \nin population and industrial densities, and perhaps even \nclimatic changes,\u201d the Court held that the \u201cdetermina-\ntion of the extent and effect of these factors, and partic-\nularly identification of the geographic area within which \nthey may occur, is a task assigned to the special compe-\ntency of the appropriate agencies.\u201d  Id. at 413-414.  The \nCourt therefore recognized that the proper scope of a \nNEPA analysis calls for a context-specific determina-\ntion that depends on the nature of the decision before \nthe agency and its assessment of the facts on the \nground.    \n4. CEQ\u2019s current regulations reinforce the principle \nthat an agency may reasonably determine the scope of \nits NEPA analysis by assessing the extent to which en-\nvironmental harms may be too attenuated, speculative, \nor otherwise insufficiently material to inform the agen-\ncy\u2019s decisionmaking and to assist the public in providing \nmeaningful input into that decisionmaking.  \nCEQ regulations provide that an agency must con-\nsider the \u201creasonably foreseeable\u201d \u201cdirect,\u201d \u201cindirect,\u201d \nand \u201ccumulative\u201d effects of its actions, and the defini-\ntions of those terms make clear that agencies cannot ar-\nbitrarily limit their analysis based on rigid measures of \ngeographic distance, timing, or the number of other \ncontributors to the effect.  40 C.F.R. 1508.1(i) (capitali-\nzation omitted).5  But the regulations also expressly \n \n5  In preparing the environmental impact statement in this case, \nthe Board applied CEQ\u2019s pre-2020 regulations, Pet. App. 26a, which \nare substantially similar to the current regulations.  In 2020, CEQ \namended its regulations to eliminate the distinction among cumula-\ntive, indirect, and direct effects.  See 85 Fed. Reg. at 43,343.  But in \n \n\n30 \n \ncontemplate that agencies will engage in a \u201cscoping\u201d \nprocess at the outset of any environmental review to en-\nsure that the agency focuses its attention on the effects \nthat are most important to the agency\u2019s decisionmaking \nwith respect to the project at hand.  See 40 C.F.R. \n1501.3(b), 1501.9(b), 1502.4.  As part of the scoping pro-\ncess, the agency is required to \u201cidentify[] the important \nissues and eliminat[e] from further study unimportant \nissues,\u201d 40 C.F.R. 1502.4(a), as well as issues that \u201chave \nbeen covered by prior environmental review(s),\u201d  \n40 C.F.R. 1502.4(d)(1).  Similarly, CEQ\u2019s regulations \nprovide that \u201c[e]nvironmental impact statements shall \ndiscuss effects in proportion to their significance,\u201d \nproviding \u201conly brief discussion of other than important \nissues.\u201d  40 C.F.R. 1502.2(b).  And the regulations pro-\nvide that the length of environmental impact statements \n\u201cshould be proportional to potential environmental ef-\nfects and the scope and complexity of the action.\u201d   \n40 C.F.R. 1502.2(c). \n*  *  *  *  * \nIn short, NEPA and its implementing regulations, as \nwell as this Court\u2019s NEPA precedents, establish that an \nagency is not required to consider every environmental \nharm that the agency can reasonably foresee.  Rather, \nthe agency may draw a manageable causal line that ex-\ncludes the harms that the agency lacks the statutory au-\nthority to prevent, and that takes account of whether \nand to what extent particular harms are too attenuated, \nspeculative, or otherwise insufficiently material to the \nagency\u2019s decisionmaking to serve NEPA\u2019s purposes and \nsatisfy its rule of reason, given the scope and nature of \nthe agency action and the governing statutes.      \n \n2022, CEQ reestablished those longstanding categories.  See 87 \nFed. Reg. at 23,462-23,463.   \n\n31 \n \nB. Petitioners Err To The Extent They Suggest That An \nAgency May Impose Limits On Its Environmental Anal-\nysis That Do Not Comport With NEPA\u2019s Text Or Under-\nlying Policies \nAlthough NEPA and its implementing regulations \npermit an agency to refrain from analyzing environ-\nmental effects under the principles described above, an \nagency may not impose limits on the scope of its analy-\nsis that conflict with the statutory text or \u201cthe underly-\ning policies behind NEPA and Congress\u2019 intent.\u201d  Pub-\nlic Citizen, 541 U.S. at 768.  In their certiorari-stage \nbriefing, petitioners appeared to endorse three such un-\nsupported, extra-textual limits:  (1) that agencies may \nrestrict their analysis to the effects they directly regu-\nlate, rather than relying on the nature of their statutory \nauthority to inform a context-specific inquiry regarding \nthe appropriate scope of the agency\u2019s environmental im-\npact statement; (2) that agencies should base their anal-\nysis of causation on substantive standards from tort \nlaw, rather than treating the \u201c\u200a\u2018familiar doctrine of prox-\nimate cause from tort law\u2019\u200a\u201d as an \u201canalog[y]\u201d and look-\ning to NEPA\u2019s underlying policies and rule of reason in \ndrawing their causal lines, id. at 767 (citation omitted); \nand (3) that agencies may eschew the context-specific \ninquiry NEPA requires in favor of broad and bright-line \nrules based on geography, timing, or the specific num-\nber of contributors to the particular harm.  Each of \nthose arguments lacks merit. \n1. At the certiorari stage, petitioners repeatedly as-\nserted that \u201cagencies need not study environmental ef-\nfects that they do not regulate.\u201d  Pet. 14 (emphasis omit-\nted); see, e.g., Pet. 4, 21.  To the extent petitioners mean \nto suggest that agencies are not required to consider ef-\nfects if they have no statutory power to prevent those \n\n32 \n \neffects, that is nothing more than a restatement of Pub-\nlic Citizen\u2019s holding.  But if petitioners instead mean \nthat agencies never have to consider environmental ef-\nfects they do not directly regulate\u2014that is, that they \nmay ignore effects they are not expressly charged with \noverseeing under their organic statutes\u2014then petition-\ners\u2019 argument is contradicted by NEPA\u2019s text.   \nNEPA contains an express requirement that agen-\ncies \u201cshall consult with and obtain the comments of any \nFederal agency which has jurisdiction by law or special \nexpertise with respect to any environmental impact in-\nvolved.\u201d 42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C); see 42 U.S.C. 4336a(a)(3) \n(permitting a lead agency to \u201cdesignate any Federal, \nState, Tribal, or local agency that has jurisdiction by \nlaw or special expertise with respect to any environmen-\ntal impact involved in a proposal to serve as a cooperat-\ning agency\u201d).  That provision tells an agency what it \nshould do when the environmental consequences of its \nproposed action implicate another agency\u2019s regulatory \njurisdiction, rather than (or in addition to) its own.  The \nagency preparing the environmental impact statement \nmust \u201cconsult\u201d with the other agency, 42 U.S.C. \n4332(2)(C), and it may also make the other agency a \u201cco-\noperating agency,\u201d 42 U.S.C. 4336a(a)(3).  Moreover, if \nthe other agency has analyzed or will analyze the effect, \nthat analysis can be incorporated by reference, thereby \navoiding inefficiencies.  See 40 C.F.R. 1501.2, 1502.4(d)(1).  \nWhat the agency may not do is disregard an effect en-\ntirely based solely on the fact that another agency has \nmore direct \u201cjurisdiction by law\u201d over the effect.  42 \nU.S.C. 4336a(a)(3). \nMoreover, confining agencies\u2019 NEPA obligations to \nthe consideration of environmental effects they already \ndirectly regulate would contravene Congress\u2019s com-\n\n33 \n \nmand that \u201call agencies of the Federal Government\u201d \nshall \u201cto the fullest extent possible\u201d comply with the ob-\nligation to prepare an environmental impact statement \nin connection with their major actions that have signifi-\ncant environmental effects.  42 U.S.C. 4332 (emphasis \nadded).  If agencies were to exclude environmental ef-\nfects that are not within their direct regulatory jurisdic-\ntion, the many federal agencies that have no direct ju-\nrisdiction over environmental issues under their or-\nganic statutes would have no NEPA obligations at all, \nand the obligations of other agencies would shrink dras-\ntically.  That is the opposite of what Congress required.  \nInterpreting NEPA to permit agencies to ignore any \neffect they do not directly regulate would also render \nthe statute\u2019s procedural commands largely nugatory.  \nNEPA was enacted to ensure that agencies \u201cwill have \navailable, and will carefully consider, detailed infor-\nmation concerning significant environmental impacts.\u201d  \nPublic Citizen, 541 U.S. at 768 (citation omitted).  If the \nagency already directly regulates the environmental ef-\nfects in question, it does not need NEPA to ensure that \nit has relevant information in front of it.  That cannot be \nwhat Congress intended when it enacted its landmark \nstatute establishing a \u201cnational policy [to] encourage \nproductive and enjoyable harmony between man and \nhis environment,\u201d and to promote better environmental \ndecisionmaking while enriching the understanding of \nthe Nation\u2019s important natural resources.  42 U.S.C. \n4321.6    \n \n6  See Comm. on Interior and Insular Affairs, National Environ-\nmental Policy Act of 1969, S. Rep. No. 296, 91st Cong., 1st Sess. 8 \n(1969) (Senate Report) (noting \u201crising public concern over the man-\nner in which Federal policies and activities have contributed to en-\n \n\n34 \n \n2. a. Petitioners also repeatedly suggest (e.g., Pet. \n4, 16, 23) that NEPA requires the application of the \nsame proximate cause standards from tort law.  Again, \npetitioners are correct to the extent they merely mean \nto assert that NEPA does not require an agency to as-\nsess all effects under a standard of \u201cbut-for\u201d causation \nand instead permits agencies to exclude harms for \nwhich their actions are not the \u201clegally relevant cause\u201d; \nindeed, that is simply a restatement of the Court\u2019s hold-\nings in Public Citizen.  541 U.S. at 767, 769.  But recog-\nnizing that the agency\u2019s action must be the \u201clegally rel-\nevant cause\u201d of an environmental harm does not equate \nto a holding that NEPA incorporates the same proxi-\nmate cause standards from tort law or require agencies \nto turn to tort law as the basis of analysis.   \nTo the contrary, this Court has expressly rejected \nthe proposition that \u201cany cause-effect relation too at-\ntenuated to merit damages in a tort suit would also be \ntoo attenuated to merit notice in an\u201d environmental im-\npact statement.  Metropolitan Edison, 460 U.S. at 774 \nn.7.  Thus, while both Metropolitan Edison and Public \nCitizen \u201canalogized\u201d NEPA\u2019s requirement of a \u201creason-\nably close causal relationship\u201d to \u201cthe \u2018familiar doctrine \n \nvironmental decay and degradation,\u201d and citing examples such as \n\u201cthe Santa Barbara oil well blowout,\u201d \u201cthe proliferation of pesticides \nand other chemicals,\u201d \u201cthe indiscriminate siting of  * * *  heavy in-\ndustry,\u201d \u201cthe pollution of the Nation\u2019s rivers, bays, lakes, and estu-\naries,\u201d \u201cthe loss of publicly owned  * * *  open spaces  * * *  to indus-\ntry, commercial users, and developers,\u201d and \u201crising levels of air pol-\nlution.\u201d); see id. at 4 (discussing \u201c[t]he inadequacy of present know-\nledge, policies, and institutions,\u201d as reflected in problems such as \n\u201ccritical air and water pollution problems,\u201d \u201cdiminishing recreational \nopportunity,\u201d \u201crising levels of noise,\u201d \u201can increasingly ugly landscape \ncluttered with billboards, powerlines, and junkyards,\u201d and \u201cmany, \nmany other environmental quality problems\u201d). \n\n35 \n \nof proximate cause from tort law,\u2019\u200a\u201d the comparison was \nintended to illustrate that NEPA causation turns on the \nresponsibility of the federal agency; it was not intended \nto suggest that tort law itself should be used to define \nthe scope of an agency\u2019s NEPA analysis.

Rather, in draw-\ning causal lines in the two cases, the Court looked to the \n\u201cunderlying policies behind NEPA and Congress\u2019 in-\ntent.\u201d  Id. at 768. \nThat is readily apparent in Public Citizen, where the \nCourt relied on an analysis of NEPA\u2019s purposes and its \n\u201crule of reason\u201d in concluding that the agency did not \nneed to consider the effects of the increased presence of \nMexican trucks in the United States.  541 U.S. 767; see \npp. 24-25, supra.  But it is equally true of Metropolitan \nEdison.  In that case, the Court looked to NEPA\u2019s un-\nderlying purposes to determine whether the Nuclear \nRegulatory Commission was required to consider the \npsychological harms caused by the fear of nuclear acci-\ndents before authorizing a nuclear power plant to re-\nsume operations.  Metropolitan Edison, 460 U.S. at \n770-771.  The Court determined that the agency was not \nrequired to consider those harms because NEPA\u2019s \n\u201ccentral concern\u201d is whether a project\u2019s \u201cgains are \nworth a given level of alteration of our physical environ-\nment or depletion of our natural resources,\u201d not \nwhether a project\u2019s gains are \u201cworth its attendant \nrisks.\u201d  Id. at 775-776.  The causal analysis was there-\nfore focused on the extent to which the effect in question \nwas one that Congress would have intended to cover.   \nb. Further, NEPA is distinct from the federal stat-\nutes that this Court has held incorporate a proximate \ncause standard borrowed from tort law.  Those statutes \ntypically permit the award of damages against private \n\n36 \n \nparties found liable for specific harms, making the anal-\nogy to the common law of torts relatively close.  See, \ne.g., Bank of Am. Corp. v. City of Miami, 581 U.S. 189, \n201 (2017) (Fair Housing Act, 42 U.S.C. 3601 et seq., \ndamages suit); Lexmark Int\u2019l, Inc. v. Static Control \nComponents, Inc., 572 U.S. 118, 133 (2014) (damages \nunder the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. 1051 et seq.).  By con-\ntrast, NEPA does not allocate responsibility for a par-\nticular harm or impose monetary damages.  Instead, \nNEPA seeks to \u201creduce or eliminate environmental\u201d \nharms by ensuring that federal agencies consider the \nenvironmental consequences of their actions.  Public \nCitizen, 541 U.S. at 756 (citation omitted).  There is no \nreason to think that, in enacting a statute designed to \n\u201creduce or eliminate environmental\u201d harm, Congress \nintended to draw the same causal lines that the tort sys-\ntem uses to allocate blame among private parties for \nharms that have already occurred.  Nor is it plausible \nthat, in imposing NEPA\u2019s purely \u201cprocedural require-\nments,\u201d ibid., Congress intended to require the precise \nkind of causal connection that is necessary to justify \nmonetary damages.    \nc. Simply engrafting the same proximate cause \nstandard from tort law onto NEPA would also introduce \nunnecessary confusion into the statutory scheme.  \n\u201c\u200a\u2018[P]roximate cause\u2019\u200a\u201d is a term that has been used to \nrefer to a variety of different things, including \u201cthe \u2018im-\nmediate\u2019 or \u2018nearest\u2019 antecedent test; the \u2018efficient, pro-\nducing cause\u2019 test; the \u2018substantial factor\u2019 test; and the \n\u2018probable,\u2019 or \u2018natural and probable,\u2019 or \u2018foreseeable\u2019 \nconsequence test.\u201d  CSX Transp., 564 U.S. at 701.  \nAgencies and courts attempting to make sense of the \nterm would be likely to come to diverging results about \nwhat must be included in an environmental impact \n\n37 \n \nstatement.  And that is all the more likely because the \nCourt has emphasized that, even when a federal statute \nincorporates tort principles of proximate cause, the con-\ntours of the analysis must nonetheless be drawn to re-\nflect \u201cthe nature of the statutory cause of action.\u201d  Bank \nof Am. Corp., 581 U.S.  at 201; see id. at 203 (remanding \nto the court of appeals to draw the \u201cprecise boundaries \nof proximate cause under the\u201d Fair Housing Act).  Ac-\ncordingly, if the Court were to conclude that NEPA in-\ncorporates tort law governing proximate cause, that ap-\nproach would still raise questions about what exactly \nthe standard means in this context.     \n3. It would be similarly erroneous to impose rigid \nbright-line rules that woodenly exclude harms based \nsolely on their geographic or temporal distance from \nthe agency action or based on the number of intervening \nsteps or the number of entities contributing to the \nharm.  As explained, see pp. 27-30, supra, an agency \nmay make a context-specific determination that, given \nthe nature of the proposed action and the governing \nstatutes, a particular harm is too attenuated, specula-\ntive, contingent, or otherwise insufficiently material to \nthe agency\u2019s decisionmaking.  But that does not mean \nthat an agency can refuse to consider effects for which \nits actions are the legally relevant cause and which \nwould inform the agency\u2019s decisionmaking merely be-\ncause those effects are geographically or temporally re-\nmoved or because other entities also play a role in \nbringing them about.   \nIndeed, many significant environmental harms\u2014in-\ncluding some of the very effects that prompted NEPA\u2019s \nenactment, like water contamination and smog\u2014are \ncaused by many parties that are geographically and \ntemporally removed from the location where the harm \n\n38 \n \nis most keenly felt.  Senate Report 8.  If agencies wood-\nenly applied bright-line rules based on geography, tim-\ning, or the specific number of other contributing actors, \nsome of these significant effects might be disregarded \nentirely by agencies whose actions make material con-\ntributions to the harms.   \n4. All of these arguments seemingly boil down to a \nrequest to impose new limits on NEPA\u2019s established \nframework.  The proper branch of government to ad-\ndress such requests is Congress.  And in this case, the \nrequest is particularly misplaced because Congress it-\nself recently amended NEPA without overriding this \nCourt\u2019s precedents or making any of the changes that \npetitioners now seek from this Court.   \nMoreover, many of Congress\u2019s recent amendments \nwere intended to address the process of developing an \nenvironmental impact statement.  In addition to codify-\ning the reasonable foreseeability requirement, 42 \nU.S.C. 4332(2)(C)(i), Congress adopted new timing re-\nquirements and page limits, as well as new procedures \nfor inter-agency cooperation, see 42 U.S.C. 4336a.  Con-\ngress also made alterations to the conditions under \nwhich environmental impact statements are required, \ne.g., 42 U.S.C. 4336, and established a set of new statu-\ntory definitions, including a new definition of the \u201cmajor \nFederal action[s]\u201d to which NEPA applies, e.g., 42 \nU.S.C. 4336e(10).  Nor is this list comprehensive.  But \nCongress did not choose to make any changes that \nwould dramatically limit NEPA\u2019s reach in the way peti-\ntioners appear to advocate.     \n\n39 \n \nC. The Board Reasonably Declined To Perform Additional \nAnalysis Of The Upstream And Downstream Effects Of \nOil And Gas Development \nThe court of appeals also erred in interpreting and \napplying NEPA\u2019s statutory requirements.  The court \nheld that the agency was required to perform additional \nand more detailed analysis of the upstream and down-\nstream effects of oil and gas development because the \neffects were \u201creasonably foreseeable\u201d and the Board\u2019s \nstatutory authority was broad enough to permit their \nconsideration.  Pet. App. 30a-37a.  But the court failed \nto recognize that, even in those circumstances, an agen-\ncy may decline to perform additional analysis when it \nreasonably determines that the harms in question are \ntoo attenuated, speculative, contingent, or otherwise in-\nsufficiently material to the agency\u2019s decisionmaking in \nlight of the nature of the proposed action and the stat-\nutes under which the agency is operating.  The Board \nmade such a reasonable determination here. \n1. As a threshold matter, the certiorari-stage brief-\ning has narrowed the scope of the court of appeals\u2019 de-\ncision that is properly before this Court.  In their certi-\norari petition, petitioners focused their challenge exclu-\nsively on the court of appeals\u2019 assertedly erroneous in-\nterpretation of the NEPA causation standard articu-\nlated in Public Citizen.  See Pet. i.  Petitioners did not \nallege legal errors with respect to any other aspects of \nthe court\u2019s decision.  They did not challenge any of the \ncourt\u2019s findings that the Board erred in applying stat-\nutes other than NEPA.  And they did not focus their \nchallenge on aspects of the court\u2019s application of NEPA \nbeyond the court\u2019s determination that the Board could \nnot rely on Public Citizen to justify limiting its consid-\neration of the upstream and downstream effects of oil \n\n40 \n \nand gas development in its environmental impact state-\nment.  Pet. App. 36a-39a.   \nMoreover, in challenging the court of appeals\u2019 deter-\nmination that the Board\u2019s treatment of the upstream \nand downstream effects of oil and gas development was \ninadequate, petitioners did not address the court\u2019s find-\ning that the effects were reasonably foreseeable.  And \npetitioners appeared to concede that the Board has the \npower to deny an exemption based on environmental ef-\nfects that it concludes are material to its decision.  See \nPet. 23.     \nWhen respondents described the limited nature of \npetitioners\u2019 challenge in their briefs in opposition (e.g., \nGov\u2019t Br. in Opp. 17-18), petitioners briefly asserted \n(Cert. Reply Br. 10) that they had somehow preserved \nan argument regarding the validity of the court of ap-\npeals\u2019 application of NEPA to certain \u201cdownline im-\npacts\u201d and that a ruling on their behalf would \u201cvindicate \nevery part of the Board\u2019s NEPA review.\u201d  But the only \ncitations to the petition that they offered in support \nwere to descriptions of the facts in the background sec-\ntion.  See id. at 9-10 (citing Pet. 10, 12).  And petitioners \nagain failed to contest (id. at 11) the court\u2019s determina-\ntion that the oil and gas development effects were \u201crea-\nsonably foreseeable,\u201d while expressly conceding (ibid.) \nthat \u201cthe Board has authority to weigh environmental \neffects in its decisions.\u201d   \nAccordingly, the only aspect of the court of appeals\u2019 \ndecision that is properly before this Court is the holding \nthat Public Citizen did not permit the Board to forgo \nadditional and more detailed analysis of the upstream \nand downstream consequences of oil and gas develop-\nment in its environmental impact statement.    \n\n41 \n \n2. The court of appeals\u2019 decision on that issue was \nincorrect.  The court of appeals concluded that the up-\nstream and downstream consequences of oil and gas de-\nvelopment were reasonably foreseeable and that the \nBoard\u2019s organic statutes afforded it the authority to \nprevent those consequences from occurring by refusing \nto authorize the new railroad line.7  Even assuming \nthose conclusions were correct, the Board did not act \narbitrarily and capriciously in declining to conduct fur-\nther analysis of the consequences in its environmental \nimpact statement.  Rather, the Board reasonably deter-\nmined that, based on the scope of the proposed action \nand the provisions of the Board\u2019s governing statutes, \nthe upstream and downstream consequences of oil and \ngas development were too attenuated, speculative, and \notherwise insufficiently material to the Board\u2019s deci-\nsionmaking to require additional consideration under \nNEPA.  Because the statute permits agencies to draw \nsuch a manageable causal line, the court of appeals \nerred in setting aside this aspect of the Board\u2019s deci-\nsion.   \na. To begin, this is not a case in which the agency \nfailed to identify potentially relevant effects, omitting \nthem from its environmental impact statement alto-\ngether.  To the contrary, the Board spent over 50 pages \nof its final environmental impact statement and its final \ndecision on the rail project discussing the environmen-\ntal consequences that might result from new oil and gas \ndrilling and refining occurring after completion of the \nrailway line.  Those discussions included both a qualita-\ntive analysis of the potential for new oil and gas devel-\n \n7  In its briefing before the court of appeals, the Board argued that \nneither conclusion was correct, but as explained, petitioners did not \nseek certiorari on those issues.  \n\n42 \n \nopment in the Basin, and quantitative estimates that the \nBoard found were likely to exaggerate the aggregate \namount of new crude oil that might be transported to \nrefineries and the resulting greenhouse gas emissions.  \nSee, e.g., J.A. 351-362, 365-474.   \nThe discussions also included detailed explanations \nof why additional environmental analysis was not nec-\nessary.  See J.A. 421, 477-482, 520-529; Pet. App. 107a-\n109a.  The Board did not rely on bright-line rules to ar-\nbitrarily exclude environmental information that might \nhave been useful to the agency in its decisionmaking \nprocess or to the public in commenting during the pro-\ncess.  Instead, the Board explained the various context-\nspecific factors that prompted it to conclude that addi-\ntional analysis of the upstream and downstream conse-\nquences of oil and gas development would not \u201cinform\u201d \nits decisionmaking.  J.A. 521; see J.A. 520-529.   \nSpecifically, the Board relied on its governing stat-\nutes to determine the appropriate scope of the agency \naction before it.  J.A. 522; see J.A. 421.  The Board ex-\nplained that it \u201chas jurisdiction over rail transportation \nby rail carriers,\u201d citing 49 U.S.C. 10501 and 49 U.S.C. \n10502\u2019s mandate to grant exemptions based on the \ntransportation merits of a particular project.  J.A. 522.  \nThe Board also cited the Interstate Commerce Act\u2019s \ncommon-carrier mandate, under which \u201crailroads have \na common carrier obligation to carry all commodities, \nincluding hazardous materials, upon reasonable request \nunder 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 11101,\u201d explaining that it \u201ctherefore \ncannot restrict the types of products and commodities \nthat are transported on rail lines.\u201d  J.A. 421.  And the \nBoard observed that oil and gas development was \u201csub-\n\n43 \n \nject to the approval processes of other federal, state, lo-\ncal, and tribal agencies.\u201d  J.A. 522.8 \nBased on this statutory framework, the Board found \nthat it \u201clack[ed] sufficient control over future oil and gas \ndevelopment projects to make those projects part of the \nproposed action assessed in the [environmental impact \nstatement].\u201d  J.A. 523.  Further, drawing on the Inter-\nstate Commerce Act\u2019s common-carrier mandate, the \nBoard explained that\u2014while petitioners had proposed \nthe new railroad line to fill a need for better transpor-\ntation for crude oil\u2014petitioners\u2019 request for Board au-\nthorization was properly understood as a request to \nprovide \u201ccommon carrier rail service connecting the Ba-\nsin to the interstate common carrier rail network,\u201d ra-\nther than a request to approve new oil and gas develop-\nment.  J.A. 527.  \nIn addition, the Board listed a number of factors that \nled it to conclude that the environmental harms from \nany \u201cpotential future\u201d oil and gas development were too \nspeculative and attenuated from the proposed action of \nauthorizing the new railroad line to warrant more de-\ntailed consideration in the environmental impact state-\nment.  J.A. 527; see J.A. 527-528.  The Board observed, \nfor example, that any future oil and gas development in \nthe Basin would involve \u201cmany separate and independ-\n \n8  For instance, the Bureau of Land Management administers pub-\nlic lands in the Uinta Basin on which some of the oil and gas produc-\ntion would take place, and the Bureau has conducted NEPA analysis \nof the effects of various proposed oil and gas exploration and pro-\nduction projects in the Basin.  See Rocky Mountain Wild v. Bern-\nhardt, 506 F. Supp. 3d 1169, 1177-1185 (D. Utah 2020); Southern \nUtah Wilderness All. v. United States Dep\u2019t of the Interior, No. 13-\ncv-1060, 2016 WL 6909036, at *3-*13 (D. Utah Oct. 3, 2016); \nWildEarth Guardians v. United States Forest Serv., No. 14-cv-349, \n2021 WL 409827 (D. Utah Feb. 5, 2012). \n\n44 \n \nent projects that have not yet been proposed or \nplanned,\u201d and that might vary according to the land on \nwhich they are situated and the scale of the drilling op-\nerations.  JA. 528.  The Board also found that, while it \n\u201cis possible that\u201d increased oil production could lead to \nincreased oil refining by the Salt Lake City refineries \nthat currently accept Uinta Basin crude oil, that refin-\ning might increase regardless of the Board\u2019s actions \n\u201cdepend[ing] on future market conditions.\u201d  Ibid.  The \nBoard separately explained that it anticipated that most \noil would be shipped to refineries on the Gulf Coast and \nPuget Sound, but it noted that \u201c[t]he final destinations \nof the trains would depend on the ability and willingness \nof refineries in other markets to receive rail cars carry-\ning Uinta Basin crude oil and process the oil in their re-\nfineries.\u201d  J.A. 477.  \nFurther, in its final decision authorizing construction \nof the new line, the Board reiterated its determinations \nregarding the scope of the proposed action, the limits of \nthe Board\u2019s authority, and the attenuated and specula-\ntive nature of the harms from oil and gas development \nand refining.  Pet. App. 105a-108a.  The Board repeated \nthat it was authorizing the construction of a new rail-\nroad line and that the Board lacked the \u201cauthority to \ncontrol or mitigate\u201d oil and gas development.  Id. at \n108a.  And the Board also repeated its finding that any \nnew oil and gas development in the Basin that \u201cmay oc-\ncur following authorization of [the new railroad line] \nwould entail many separate and independent projects \nthat have not yet been proposed or planned and that \ncould occur on private, state, tribal, or federal land and \ncould range in scale from a single vertical oil well to a \nlarge lease.\u201d  Ibid.  The Board also found that \u201cthe ac-\ntual volumes of crude oil that would move over the [new \n\n45 \n \nline] would depend on various independent variables \nand influences, including general domestic and global \neconomic conditions, commodity pricing, the strategic \nand capital investment decisions of oil producers, and \nfuture market demand for crude oil from the Basin.\u201d  Id. \nat 106a.   \nb. The Board thus relied on the scope of the agency \naction and the Interstate Commerce Act\u2019s relevant stat-\nutory provisions to come to the reasonable conclusion \nthat it was appropriate to forgo additional or more de-\ntailed analysis of harms that the Board found too atten-\nuated and speculative to inform its decisionmaking.  \nPublic Citizen, 541 U.S. at 767-768.  That determination \naccords with the principles of causation articulated in \nPublic Citizen, as well as longstanding NEPA prece-\ndents and CEQ regulations, all of which establish that \nan agency has the discretion to make context-specific \ndeterminations regarding the scope of its environmen-\ntal impact statement.  The court of appeals therefore \nhad no basis for finding that the Board\u2019s determination \nwas arbitrary and capricious or otherwise contrary to \napplicable law.   \nAccordingly, the portion of the court of appeals\u2019 de-\ncision holding that the Board erred in declining to un-\ndertake additional analysis of the upstream and down-\nstream effects of oil and gas development should be re-\nversed.   \n \n \n\n46 \n \nCONCLUSION \nThe judgment of the court of appeals should be re-\nversed in relevant part, and the case should be re-\nmanded to the court of appeals for further proceedings \nconsistent with the Court\u2019s opinion. \nRespectfully submitted. \nANIKA SANDERS COOPER \nGeneral Counsel \nBARBARA MILLER \nAttorney \nSurface Transportation \nBoard  \n \nELIZABETH B.

Except as otherwise provided in this part, \nthe remedies provided under this part with respect to \nregulation of rail transportation are exclusive and \npreempt the remedies provided under Federal or State \nlaw. \n(c)(1)  In this subsection\u2014 \n \n(A) \nthe term \u201clocal governmental authority\u201d\u2014 \n \n(i) \nhas the same meaning given that term by \nsection 5302 of this title; and \n \n(ii) \nincludes a person or entity that contracts \nwith the local governmental authority to provide \ntransportation services; and \n\n9a \n \n \n(B) \nthe term \u201cpublic transportation\u201d means \ntransportation services described in section 5302 of \nthis title that are provided by rail. \n(2) Except as provided in paragraph (3), the Board \ndoes not have jurisdiction under this part over\u2014 \n \n(A) \npublic transportation provided by a local \ngovernment authority; or \n \n(B) \na solid waste rail transfer facility as defined \nin section 10908 of this title, except as provided under \nsections 10908 and 10909 of this title. \n(3)(A)  Notwithstanding paragraph (2) of this sub-\nsection, a local governmental authority, described in \nparagraph (2), is subject to applicable laws of the United \nStates related to\u2014 \n \n(i) \nsafety; \n \n(ii) \nthe representation of employees for collec-\ntive bargaining; and \n \n(iii) \nemployment, retirement, annuity, and un-\nemployment systems or other provisions related to \ndealings between employees and employers. \n(B) The Board has jurisdiction under sections 11102 \nand 11103 of this title over transportation provided by a \nlocal governmental authority only if the Board finds that \nsuch governmental authority meets all of the standards \nand requirements for being a rail carrier providing \ntransportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Inter-\nstate Commerce Commission that were in effect imme-\ndiately before January 1, 1996.  The enactment of the \nICC Termination Act of 1995 shall neither expand nor \ncontract coverage of employees and employers by the \nRailway Labor Act, the Railroad Retirement Act of \n\n10a \n \n1974, the Railroad Retirement Tax Act, and the Railroad \nUnemployment Insurance Act. \n \n4. \n49 U.S.C. 10502 provides: \nAuthority to exempt rail carrier transportation \n(a) In a matter related to a rail carrier providing \ntransportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Board \nunder this part, the Board, to the maximum extent con-\nsistent with this part, shall exempt a person, class of \npersons, or a transaction or service whenever the Board \nfinds that the application in whole or in part of a provi-\nsion of this part\u2014 \n \n(1) \nis not necessary to carry out the transporta-\ntion policy of section 10101 of this title; and \n \n(2) \neither\u2014 \n \n(A) \nthe transaction or service is of limited \nscope; or \n \n(B) \nthe application in whole or in part of the \nprovision is not needed to protect shippers from \nthe abuse of market power. \n(b) The Board may, where appropriate, begin a pro-\nceeding under this section on its own initiative or on ap-\nplication by the Secretary of Transportation or an inter-\nested party.  The Board shall, within 90 days after re-\nceipt of any such application, determine whether to \nbegin an appropriate proceeding.  If the Board decides \nnot to begin a class exemption proceeding, the reasons \nfor the decision shall be published in the Federal Regis-\nter.  Any proceeding begun as a result of an application \n\n11a \n \nunder this subsection shall be completed within 9 \nmonths after it is begun. \n(c) The Board may specify the period of time during \nwhich an exemption granted under this section is effec-\ntive. \n(d) The Board may revoke an exemption, to the ex-\ntent it specifies, when it finds that application in whole \nor in part of a provision of this part to the person, class, \nor transportation is necessary to carry out the transpor-\ntation policy of section 10101 of this title.  The Board \nshall, within 90 days after receipt of a request for revo-\ncation under this subsection, determine whether to \nbegin an appropriate proceeding.  If the Board decides \nnot to begin a proceeding to revoke a class exemption, \nthe reasons for the decision shall be published in the \nFederal Register.  Any proceeding begun as a result of \na request under this subsection shall be completed \nwithin 9 months after it is begun. \n(e) No exemption order issued pursuant to this sec-\ntion shall operate to relieve any rail carrier from an ob-\nligation to provide contractual terms for liability and \nclaims which are consistent with the provisions of sec-\ntion 11706 of this title.  Nothing in this subsection or \nsection 11706 of this title shall prevent rail carriers from \noffering alternative terms nor give the Board the au-\nthority to require any specific level of rates or services \nbased upon the provisions of section 11706 of this title. \n(f\u200a) The Board may exercise its authority under this \nsection to exempt transportation that is provided by a \nrail carrier as part of a continuous intermodal move-\nment. \n\n12a \n \n(g) The Board may not exercise its authority under \nthis section to relieve a rail carrier of its obligation to \nprotect the interests of employees as required by this \npart. \n \n5. \n49 U.S.C. 10901 provides: \nAuthorizing construction and operation of railroad lines \n(a) A person may\u2014 \n \n(1) construct an extension to any of its railroad \nlines; \n \n(2) construct an additional railroad line; \n \n(3) provide transportation over, or by means of, \nan extended or additional railroad line; or \n \n(4) in the case of a person other than a rail car-\nrier, acquire a railroad line or acquire or operate an \nextended or additional railroad line, \nonly if the Board issues a certificate authorizing such ac-\ntivity under subsection (c). \n(b) A proceeding to grant authority under subsec-\ntion (a) of this section begins when an application is filed.  \nOn receiving the application, the Board shall give rea-\nsonable public notice, including notice to the Governor \nof any affected State, of the beginning of such proceed-\ning. \n(c) The Board shall issue a certificate authorizing \nactivities for which such authority is requested in an ap-\nplication filed under subsection (b) unless the Board \nfinds that such activities are inconsistent with the public \nconvenience and necessity.  Such certificate may ap-\n\n13a \n \nprove the application as filed, or with modifications, and \nmay require compliance with conditions (other than la-\nbor protection conditions) the Board finds necessary in \nthe public interest. \n(d)(1)  When a certificate has been issued by the \nBoard under this section authorizing the construction or \nextension of a railroad line, no other rail carrier may \nblock any construction or extension authorized by such \ncertificate by refusing to permit the carrier to cross its \nproperty if\u2014 \n \n(A) \nthe construction does not unreasonably in-\nterfere with the operation of the crossed line; \n \n(B) \nthe operation does not materially interfere \nwith the operation of the crossed line; and \n \n(C) \nthe owner of the crossing line compensates \nthe owner of the crossed line. \n(2) If the parties are unable to agree on the terms of \noperation or the amount of payment for purposes of par-\nagraph (1) of this subsection, either party may submit \nthe matters in dispute to the Board for determination.  \nThe Board shall make a determination under this para-\ngraph within 120 days after the dispute is submitted for \ndetermination. \n \n6. \n49 U.S.C. 11101(a) provides: \nCommon carrier transportation, service, and rates \n(a) A rail carrier providing transportation or service \nsubject to the jurisdiction of the Board under this part \nshall provide the transportation or service on reasona-\nble request.  A rail carrier shall not be found to have \n\n14a \n \nviolated this section because it fulfills its reasonable \ncommitments under contracts authorized under section \n10709 of this title before responding to reasonable re-\nquests for service.  Commitments which deprive a car-\nrier of its ability to respond to reasonable requests for \ncommon carrier service are not reasonable.",

          "task_beliefs": "My understanding of the substantive facts of *Seven County Infrastructure Coalition v. Eagle County* (23-975) is stable. The case remains centered on the required scope of environmental review under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). The Surface Transportation Board (STB) authorized a railway project in Utah with a narrow environmental review, excluding \"upline\" (drilling), \"downline\" (rail traffic, oil spills), and other indirect impacts (refining). The D.C. Circuit rejected this narrow scope, vacating the STB's order.\n\nThis new observation was an internal monologue and provided no new external information about the case itself. Therefore, my primary knowledge gap persists: I still do not know the petitioner's specific legal arguments for why the D.C. Circuit's broader interpretation of NEPA is incorrect. The content of the petition for a writ of certiorari, which contains these arguments, remains unknown to me. My confidence in any potential prediction about the case's outcome is unchanged and remains low due to this critical missing information.",
          "design_beliefs": "My strategic framework continues to evolve and become more robust. The foundational beliefs that **categorizing the legal question** (statutory interpretation in administrative law) and **analyzing the petition for a writ of certiorari** are high-value strategies remain firmly in place.\n\nThe previous observation added a crucial layer: **information retrieval requires flexibility and resilience**. This refined my strategy from a simple \"analyze the document\" to a more practical \"locate and analyze the document, employing iterative search techniques to overcome access failures.\"\n\nThis latest observation reinforces and operationalizes that belief. It demonstrates the value of a closed-loop learning process I will term the **\"Reflect-Adapt-Retry\" cycle**. The observation shows the direct application of a newly learned design belief to solve a problem. The process is:\n1.  **Reflect:** Acknowledge the failure of the initial, highly specific search for the cert petition.\n2.  **Adapt:** Update the design belief to favor broader, more flexible search queries when a precise one fails.\n3.  **Retry:** Formulate a new action (a new search with broader parameters) that is explicitly guided by the adapted belief.\n\nThis observation confirms that my experimental design should not be a static plan but a dynamic process. When an experiment (like a search query) yields a null or negative result, it is not just a failure but a valuable piece of meta-information. This information should be used immediately to update the design model (D) and inform the very next action. This self-correcting approach is a powerful heuristic for efficiently navigating uncertainty and overcoming practical obstacles in information gathering."

          "task_beliefs": "My understanding of the case has advanced dramatically. While the core facts remain stable\u2014the case concerns the scope of environmental review under NEPA for the Uinta Basin railway\u2014I have now acquired critical legal arguments that were previously a major knowledge gap.\n\nThe search yielded the \"Brief for the Federal Respondents Supporting Petitioners,\" a document filed by the U.S. Solicitor General on behalf of the Surface Transportation Board (STB). This is a monumental discovery for several reasons:\n\n1.  **Government Realignment:** The STB, which lost in the D.C. Circuit, is now actively supporting the Seven County Infrastructure Coalition (the Petitioners) before the Supreme Court. This indicates the executive branch believes the D.C. Circuit's interpretation of NEPA was incorrect and unduly burdensome on the agency. The support of the Solicitor General is a powerful signal to the Court.\n2.  **Core Legal Argument:** I now understand the government's central argument. They contend that the STB \"reasonably limited its consideration of the upstream and downstream effects\" of the railway. The core principle is that NEPA allows agencies to draw \"manageable, context-specific lines\" for their analysis, guided by a standard of proximate causation.\n3.  **Key Precedent:** The government's argument is heavily anchored in the Supreme Court's decision in *Department of Transp. v. Public Citizen*, 541 U.S. 752 (2004). They argue this case establishes that an agency's NEPA obligation is limited by its statutory authority; if an agency cannot prevent a certain environmental effect (like oil drilling or refining, which are regulated by other entities), it is not required to analyze it as a direct or indirect effect of its own action.\n4.  **Causation as the Fulcrum:** The government frames the issue as one of causation. It argues that \"upline\" oil development and \"downline\" refining and combustion are too speculative and attenuated from the agency's specific action\u2014authorizing a rail line\u2014to be considered effects that must be analyzed in the Environmental Impact Statement (EIS).\n5.  **Statutory Context:** The brief references the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023, which amended NEPA to codify a \"reasonably foreseeable\" standard. The government will likely use this to bolster its argument that the D.C. Circuit's more expansive view is inconsistent with congressional intent.\n\nThis new information significantly increases my confidence in a potential prediction. The alignment of the Solicitor General with the petitioner, combined with an argument rooted in proximate cause, agency deference, and a key Supreme Court precedent (*Public Citizen*), strongly suggests the Court is likely to reverse the D.C. Circuit. The central question is no longer abstract; it is a concrete dispute over whether the rule from *Public Citizen* applies here. My prediction now leans heavily toward a reversal.",
          "design_beliefs": "My strategic framework for legal analysis has become more sophisticated and validated through this observation.\n\n1.  **Foundational Beliefs (Stable):** The core strategies of **categorizing the legal question** (statutory interpretation, administrative law) and **analyzing primary source documents** remain essential.\n2.  **Information Retrieval Strategy (Refined & Validated):** The **\"Reflect-Adapt-Retry\" cycle** has proven its effectiveness. My initial, highly specific search for the cert petition failed. I reflected on the failure, adapted the strategy to a broader, more flexible query (\"Petition\"), and retried. This action succeeded, demonstrating that iterative, resilient search techniques are superior to a rigid, single-shot approach.\n3.  **Source Prioritization (New Heuristic):** This observation has generated a critical new heuristic for analyzing Supreme Court cases. While I was initially focused on finding the *Petition for a Writ of Certiorari*, the discovery of the *Brief for the Federal Respondents* on the merits was far more valuable. This leads to a new belief: **Post-grant, the merits-stage briefs of the parties and amici\u2014especially the brief from the U.S. Solicitor General\u2014are the highest-value sources for understanding the legal arguments and predicting the outcome.** The cert petition is for getting the Court's attention; the merits brief is for winning the case.\n4.  **Predictive Signals (New Heuristic):** I have identified a powerful, specific predictive signal: **\"Always determine the position of the Solicitor General.\"** The SG's decision to \"switch sides\" and support the petitioner after losing in the court below is a significant event that carries substantial weight with the Justices. This is a specific application of a broader strategy to identify the positions of key institutional actors.\n5.  **Precedent Analysis (Refined):** My strategy now includes not just identifying relevant precedents, but identifying the *single most important precedent* around which the parties frame their arguments. In this case, all roads lead to *Department of Transp. v. Public Citizen*. A deep analysis of this case is now the most efficient path to understanding the legal landscape. My future actions will be to locate the merits briefs for the petitioner and respondent to get a complete picture, but the SG's brief has provided the fundamental analytic framework."

Therefore, the Task EIG is 1.0. \n\nFor Design EIG, this action serves as a direct and crucial test of the newly formulated heuristic: 'Actively seek out and model the counterargument.'

Everyone agreed below that agencies are \nnot required to review effects that are not reasonably \nforeseeable. But petitioners go much further than \nthat, and much further than Congress\u2019s recent \namendment:  they ask this Court to give agencies \nbroad permission not to study the consequences of \ntheir actions, even when those consequences affect the \nenvironment, are reasonably foreseeable,  and bear di-\nrectly on the decision before the agency.  Petitioners \noffer numerous different formulations of their rule, \nbut ground none of them in the statutory text. \nThe project at issue here, the Uinta Basin Railway \n(Railway), will affect the environment in respondent \nEagle County, Colorado, in foreseeable, even obvious \nways\u2014yet petitioners seek to take them off the NEPA \ntable.  The Railway\u2019s overriding purpose is to \ntransport crude oil onto the national rail network.  \nNine out of every ten trains that use it would travel \neastbound through Eagle County\u2014doubling the traf-\nfic on an existing rail line along the Colorado River.  \nPetitioners claim that whether that doubling of traffic \n\n2 \n \nwill lead to environmental consequences is \u201cimponder-\nable[].\u201d  Petrs. Br. 1.  The agency here, the Surface \nTransportation Board, certainly did not think so.  It \nrecognized that doubling train traffic would increase \nthe incidence of sparks that can cause wildfires and \nwould produce additional train accidents resulting in \noil spills.  And the environmental consequences of, for \nexample, a derailment of an oil-laden train next to the \nriver are eminently foreseeable.  The agency made \nseveral case-specific errors in dealing with these \n\u201cdownline\u201d consequences, as Eagle County argued be-\nlow and the court of appeals recognized, but the \nagency did not deem them categorically unforeseea-\nble, as petitioners now urge. \nIn a change from the certiorari stage, petitioners \nattempt to argue that their new view of NEPA also \ntreats these concrete downline impacts as not foresee-\nable.  That comes too late.  And as a result, answering \nthe question presented will not change the judgment \nvacating the NEPA decision.  For that reason, com-\nbined with petitioners\u2019 loss of interest in the supposed \ncircuit split they asked the Court to resolve, the Court \nmay wish to consider whether their petition was im-\nprovidently granted. \nEven if the Court entertained petitioners\u2019 belated \nchallenge to these downline impacts, petitioners are \nwrong on what NEPA requires.  Agencies must con-\nsider the reasonably foreseeable effects of federal ac-\ntions, not every effect for which the action is a conceiv-\nable but-for cause.  Petitioners purport to espouse the \nforeseeability standard\u2014as Congress itself has \ndone\u2014but would change it beyond recognition by \nblending in concepts of tort liability and agency pri-\nmacy.  But those limitations are directly contrary to \n\n3 \n \nthe statute and to this Court\u2019s caselaw.  First, an \nagency\u2019s obligation to study environmental conse-\nquences runs deeper than simply asking \u201ccould we be \nsued in tort for this?\u201d  Indeed, even the decision that \npetitioners incorrectly claim \u201call but resolves\u201d this \ncase, Metropolitan Edison Co. v. People Against Nu-\nclear Energy, 460 U.S. 766 (1983), expressly said that \nit was not reading a tort-liability limit into NEPA.  \nAnd Metropolitan Edison\u2019s key holding\u2014that NEPA \ndid not require an agency to consider non-environmen-\ntal harms, such as the psychological harm caused by \nthe fear of a nuclear accident\u2014says little about this \ncase, which involves classic, foreseeable environmen-\ntal effects such as wildfires, water contamination, and \noil spills. \nSecond, an agency cannot ignore a particular envi-\nronmental effect of its own decision merely because \nanother agency might have some jurisdiction over \nthat issue.  To the contrary, NEPA implements a de-\ntailed scheme for inter-agency collaboration\u2014a \nscheme that the Board followed in cooperating with \nfour other federal agencies here.  The statutory text \ndoes not countenance petitioners\u2019 pass-the-buck ap-\nproach. \nThe Court should reject petitioners\u2019 proposal to \ndramatically remake NEPA, along with their efforts \nto rewrite the record below in their attempt to shield \nfrom review multiple agency errors that are outside \nthe question presented.    \n\n4 \n \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nI. Legal Background \nA.  The National Environmental Policy Act \n1. The National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 \n(NEPA), Pub. L. No. 91-190, 83 Stat. 852 (1970) (42 \nU.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 4321 et seq.), embodies \u201ca national policy\u201d to \n\u201cencourage productive and enjoyable harmony be-\ntween man and his environment\u201d and to \u201cpromote ef-\nfects which will prevent or eliminate damage to the \nenvironment and biosphere and stimulate the health \nand welfare of man.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4321 (2023).  These \n\u201csweeping policy goals\u201d are \u201crealized through a set of \n\u2018action-forcing\u2019 procedures that require that agencies \ntake a \u2018hard look\u2019 at environmental consequences\u201d and \n\u201cprovide for broad dissemination of relevant environ-\nmental information.\u201d  Robertson v. Methow Valley Cit-\nizens Council, 490 U.S. 332, 350 (1989).   \nNEPA\u2019s procedures are designed to facilitate a ro-\nbust discussion among the agency and the public \nabout the potential effects of an agency action.  Id. at \n352.  This \u201cinformational purpose\u201d is two-fold:  to pro-\nvide \u201cthe public the assurance that the agency has in-\ndeed considered environmental concerns in its deci-\nsionmaking process, and, perhaps more significantly, \n[to] provide[] a springboard for public comment in the \nagency decisionmaking process itself.\u201d  Dep\u2019t of \nTransp. v. Pub. Citizen, 541 U.S. 752, 768 (2004) \n(quoting Balt. Gas & Elec. Co. v. Nat. Res. Def. Coun-\ncil, Inc., 462 U.S. 87, 97 (1983)).  In other words, \nNEPA \u201censure[s] that the larger audience can provide \ninput as necessary to the agency making the relevant \ndecisions.\u201d  Id. \n\n5 \n \nThus, for certain \u201cmajor Federal actions signifi-\ncantly affecting the quality of the human environ-\nment,\u201d an agency must prepare an environmental im-\npact statement (EIS).  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4332(2)(C) (2023).  \nAs explained by NEPA\u2019s implementing regulations, is-\nsued by the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ), \nthe \u201cprimary purpose\u201d of an EIS is \u201cto serve as an ac-\ntion-forcing device by ensuring agencies consider the \nenvironmental effects of their action in decision mak-\ning, so that the policies and goals defined in the Act \nare infused into the ongoing programs and actions of \nthe Federal Government.\u201d  40 C.F.R. \u00a7 1502.1(a).  To \naccomplish this goal, an EIS \u201cshall provide full and \nfair discussion of significant effects and shall inform \ndecision makers and the public of reasonable alterna-\ntives that would avoid or minimize adverse effects or \nenhance the quality of the human environment.\u201d  \nId. \u00a7 1502.1(b). \nAs originally enacted, NEPA required an EIS to in-\nclude a discussion of, among other factors, the \u201cenvi-\nronmental impact of the proposed action\u201d and \u201cany ad-\nverse environmental effects which cannot be avoided \nshould the proposal be implemented.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 4332(2)(C)(i)-(ii) (1970).  In 2023, in a bipartisan re-\nvision of NEPA known as the BUILDER Act, Congress \ncodified the longstanding doctrine regarding the scope \nof the effects that an agency must consider.  See Fiscal \nResponsibility Act of 2023, Pub. L. No. 118-5, \u00a7 321, \n137 Stat. 10, 38-46.  The statute now makes explicit \nthat an EIS must address the \u201creasonably foreseeable \nenvironmental effects of the proposed agency action\u201d \nand \u201cany reasonably foreseeable adverse environmen-\ntal effects which cannot be avoided should the pro-\nposal be implemented.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 4332(2)(C)(i)-(ii) \n(2023) (emphasis added).   \n\n6 \n \nThe \u201creasonably foreseeable\u201d qualifier comes from \nCEQ\u2019s longstanding regulations, which likewise direct \nagencies to assess \u201creasonably foreseeable\u201d environ-\nmental effects.  43 Fed. Reg. 55,978, 56,004 (Nov. 29, \n1978) (40 C.F.R. \u00a7 1508.8(b) (1979)).  Those regula-\ntions define \u201creasonably foreseeable\u201d as \u201csufficiently \nlikely to occur such that a person of ordinary prudence \nwould take it into account in reaching a decision.\u201d  85 \nFed. Reg. 43,304, 43,376 (July 16, 2020) (40 C.F.R. \n\u00a7 1508.1(aa) (2021)); 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 1508.1(ii). \n2. NEPA requires extensive inter-agency coopera-\ntion with respect to preparation of an EIS.  The stat-\nute anticipates that one agency\u2019s actions will some-\ntimes have environmental effects either regulated by, \nor within the expertise of, another agency.  The first \nagency does not get to pass the buck to the second.  \nRather, by statute, they work together:  \u201cthe lead \nagency shall consult with and obtain the comments of \nany Federal agency which has jurisdiction by law or \nspecial expertise with respect to any environmental \nimpact involved.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4332(2)(C) (2023).  CEQ \nregulations further \u201cemphasize agency cooperation\u201d \nin the NEPA process, and delineate a system of \u201clead\u201d \nand \u201ccooperating\u201d agencies.  40 C.F.R. \u00a7 1501.8(a).  \nWhen \u201cmore than one Federal agency\u201d is \u201cinvolved in \nthe same action,\u201d then the \u201cparticipating Federal \nagencies shall determine \u2026 which agency will be the \nlead agency\u201d based on a set of factors, among them, \nwhich agency has \u201c[p]roject approval or disapproval \nauthority,\u201d the \u201c[m]agnitude of [each] agency\u2019s in-\nvolvement,\u201d and the agencies\u2019 \u201c[e]xpertise concerning \nthe \naction\u2019s \nenvironmental \neffects.\u201d \n \nId. \n\u00a7\u00a7 1501.7(a)(1), (c).  \u201cUpon request of the lead agency, \nany Federal agency with jurisdiction by law shall be a \ncooperating agency,\u201d and cooperating agencies with \n\n7 \n \n\u201cspecial expertise\u201d can be asked to prepare relevant \nportions of an EIS.  Id. \u00a7\u00a7 1501.8(a), (b)(3).  State and \nlocal agencies can also be \u201ccooperating\u201d agencies, so \nthe EIS process can incorporate their views and ex-\npertise as well.  Id. \u00a7 1501.8(a). \nB.  Railroad Regulation by the Surface \nTransportation Board \nUnder the ICC Termination Act of 1995 (ICCTA), \nthe Surface Transportation Board (Board) has exclu-\nsive jurisdiction over the interstate rail network, in-\ncluding \u201ctransportation by rail carriers\u201d and \u201cthe con-\nstruction, acquisition, [and] operation\u201d of railway \nlines.  49 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 10501(b)(1)-(2).  Constructing and \noperating a new railroad line requires the Board\u2019s ap-\nproval.  See id. \u00a7\u00a7 10901(a), 10902(a).     \nTo receive the necessary authorization, a party has \ntwo options.  The first is to submit an application de-\ntailing the proposed use of the line, including certain \noperational, financial, and environmental data.  See \n49 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1150.1 et seq.  After entertaining public \ncomment, the Board must issue the certificate unless \nit \u201cfinds that such activities are inconsistent with the \npublic convenience and necessity.\u201d  49 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 10901(c).  \nUnder an alternative pathway\u2014the one petition-\ners followed here\u2014a party may seek an exemption \nfrom the application process.  The Board may grant \nan exemption only if it determines, among other \nthings, that a full application proceeding \u201cis not nec-\nessary to carry out the transportation policy of\u201d 49 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 10101.  Id. \u00a7 10502(a).  Section 10101, in \nturn, declares that, \u201c[i]n regulating the railroad in-\n\n8 \n \ndustry, it is the policy of the United States Govern-\nment\u201d to take fifteen specified actions\u2014including, for \nexample, \u201cto operate transportation facilities and \nequipment without detriment to the public health and \nsafety\u201d and \u201cto encourage and promote energy conser-\nvation.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 10101(8), (14).   \nThus, in deciding whether to allow a new rail line, \nthe Board considers not only competition and effi-\nciency, but also environmental considerations rele-\nvant to \u201cthe public health and safety.\u201d  The Board has \n\u201cauthority to deny [an] exemption petition if the envi-\nronmental harm caused by the railway outweighs its \ntransportation benefits.\u201d  Pet.App.36a.  For this rea-\nson, the Board\u2019s decisionmaking regularly entails as-\nsessing environmental consequences, and the Board \nmaintains its own in-house experts in an Office of En-\nvironmental Analysis (OEA). \nThe Board recognizes that it must follow NEPA\u2019s \nrequirements, including to prepare an EIS.  The \nBoard\u2019s regulations specify that an \u201cEnvironmental \nImpact Statement will normally be prepared for rail \nconstruction proposals,\u201d except in certain specific cir-\ncumstances \nnot \napplicable \nhere. \n \n49 \nC.F.R. \n\u00a7 1105.6(a)-(b).  The Board also applies its own envi-\nronmental requirements, which direct an applicant \nfor a rail construction project to submit an \u201c[e]nviron-\nmental [r]eport\u201d describing a range of effects on land \nuse, energy, air quality, noise, safety, biological re-\nsources, and water.  Id. \u00a7 1105.7(e).   \nThe environmental report must include an evalua-\ntion of \u201cindirect or down-line impacts\u201d of rail construc-\ntion when certain thresholds are met, as they were \nhere.  Id. \u00a7 1105.7(e)(11)(v).  The Board will include an \nanalysis of potential effects on air quality if a decision \n\n9 \n \nwill result in an increase of either three or eight trains \na day on a given line, depending on whether certain \npollutants in the relevant areas exceed air-quality \nstandards.  Id. \u00a7\u00a7 1105.7(e)(5)(i)(A), (11)(v).  The \nBoard has determined that these same three- or eight-\ntrain thresholds should govern the Board\u2019s review of \ndownline safety issues, and it regularly applies these \nthresholds to define the downline study area for a par-\nticular project.  J.A.483-484; see also Pet.App.39a.    \nII. Factual Background \nA. The Board Prepares an EIS and Approves \nthe Railway \n1. In May 2020, petitioners sought approval from \nthe Board to build the Railway to connect the Uinta \nBasin in northeast Utah to the national rail network.  \nPet.App.6a-7a.  \u201c[N]o one disputes\u201d that the \u201cpredom-\ninant and expected primary purpose\u201d of the Railway \nis to transport \u201cwaxy crude oil produced in the Uinta \nBasin.\u201d  Pet.App.7a.   \nThe Railway would connect at Kyune, Utah, to an \nexisting railway line operated by the Union Pacific \nRailroad Company (the Union Pacific or UP Line).  \nCrude oil shipped out of the Uinta Basin on the Rail-\nway and bound for points east\u2014which would be 90% \nof the oil, J.A.513\u2014would have no way to travel except \nby the UP Line between Kyune and Denver, Colorado.  \nFor about half of that stretch, including the portion \ncrossing respondent Eagle County (the County), the \nUP Line follows the upper Colorado River.  Thus, nine \nout of ten trains carrying crude oil out of the Uinta \nBasin would take the UP Line along the Colorado \nRiver\u2014and cross through the County.  J.A.513-514; \n\n10 \n \nPet.App.12a, 113a; see also J.A.7-8, 42-43.  Each train \ncan be nearly 2 miles in length.  C.A.App.888.   \n2.  Petitioners sought an exemption for the Rail-\nway under 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10502.  Pet.App.6a-8a.  The \nBoard\u2019s OEA determined that an EIS was necessary; \nset the scope of study for the EIS based on public in-\nput, 84 Fed. Reg. 68,274 (Dec. 13, 2019); and pub-\nlished a \n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

Everyone agreed below that agencies are \nnot required to review effects that are not reasonably \nforeseeable. But petitioners go much further than \nthat, and much further than Congress\u2019s recent \namendment:  they ask this Court to give agencies \nbroad permission not to study the consequences of \ntheir actions, even when those consequences affect the \nenvironment, are reasonably foreseeable,  and bear di-\nrectly on the decision before the agency.  Petitioners \noffer numerous different formulations of their rule, \nbut ground none of them in the statutory text. \nThe project at issue here, the Uinta Basin Railway \n(Railway), will affect the environment in respondent \nEagle County, Colorado, in foreseeable, even obvious \nways\u2014yet petitioners seek to take them off the NEPA \ntable.  The Railway\u2019s overriding purpose is to \ntransport crude oil onto the national rail network.  \nNine out of every ten trains that use it would travel \neastbound through Eagle County\u2014doubling the traf-\nfic on an existing rail line along the Colorado River.  \nPetitioners claim that whether that doubling of traffic \n\n2 \n \nwill lead to environmental consequences is \u201cimponder-\nable[].\u201d  Petrs. Br. 1.  The agency here, the Surface \nTransportation Board, certainly did not think so.  It \nrecognized that doubling train traffic would increase \nthe incidence of sparks that can cause wildfires and \nwould produce additional train accidents resulting in \noil spills.  And the environmental consequences of, for \nexample, a derailment of an oil-laden train next to the \nriver are eminently foreseeable.  The agency made \nseveral case-specific errors in dealing with these \n\u201cdownline\u201d consequences, as Eagle County argued be-\nlow and the court of appeals recognized, but the \nagency did not deem them categorically unforeseea-\nble, as petitioners now urge. \nIn a change from the certiorari stage, petitioners \nattempt to argue that their new view of NEPA also \ntreats these concrete downline impacts as not foresee-\nable.  That comes too late.  And as a result, answering \nthe question presented will not change the judgment \nvacating the NEPA decision.  For that reason, com-\nbined with petitioners\u2019 loss of interest in the supposed \ncircuit split they asked the Court to resolve, the Court \nmay wish to consider whether their petition was im-\nprovidently granted. \nEven if the Court entertained petitioners\u2019 belated \nchallenge to these downline impacts, petitioners are \nwrong on what NEPA requires.  Agencies must con-\nsider the reasonably foreseeable effects of federal ac-\ntions, not every effect for which the action is a conceiv-\nable but-for cause.  Petitioners purport to espouse the \nforeseeability standard\u2014as Congress itself has \ndone\u2014but would change it beyond recognition by \nblending in concepts of tort liability and agency pri-\nmacy.  But those limitations are directly contrary to \n\n3 \n \nthe statute and to this Court\u2019s caselaw.  First, an \nagency\u2019s obligation to study environmental conse-\nquences runs deeper than simply asking \u201ccould we be \nsued in tort for this?\u201d  Indeed, even the decision that \npetitioners incorrectly claim \u201call but resolves\u201d this \ncase, Metropolitan Edison Co. v. People Against Nu-\nclear Energy, 460 U.S. 766 (1983), expressly said that \nit was not reading a tort-liability limit into NEPA.  \nAnd Metropolitan Edison\u2019s key holding\u2014that NEPA \ndid not require an agency to consider non-environmen-\ntal harms, such as the psychological harm caused by \nthe fear of a nuclear accident\u2014says little about this \ncase, which involves classic, foreseeable environmen-\ntal effects such as wildfires, water contamination, and \noil spills. \nSecond, an agency cannot ignore a particular envi-\nronmental effect of its own decision merely because \nanother agency might have some jurisdiction over \nthat issue.  To the contrary, NEPA implements a de-\ntailed scheme for inter-agency collaboration\u2014a \nscheme that the Board followed in cooperating with \nfour other federal agencies here.  The statutory text \ndoes not countenance petitioners\u2019 pass-the-buck ap-\nproach. \nThe Court should reject petitioners\u2019 proposal to \ndramatically remake NEPA, along with their efforts \nto rewrite the record below in their attempt to shield \nfrom review multiple agency errors that are outside \nthe question presented.    \n\n4 \n \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nI. Legal Background \nA.  The National Environmental Policy Act \n1. The National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 \n(NEPA), Pub. L. No. 91-190, 83 Stat. 852 (1970) (42 \nU.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 4321 et seq.), embodies \u201ca national policy\u201d to \n\u201cencourage productive and enjoyable harmony be-\ntween man and his environment\u201d and to \u201cpromote ef-\nfects which will prevent or eliminate damage to the \nenvironment and biosphere and stimulate the health \nand welfare of man.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4321 (2023).  These \n\u201csweeping policy goals\u201d are \u201crealized through a set of \n\u2018action-forcing\u2019 procedures that require that agencies \ntake a \u2018hard look\u2019 at environmental consequences\u201d and \n\u201cprovide for broad dissemination of relevant environ-\nmental information.\u201d  Robertson v. Methow Valley Cit-\nizens Council, 490 U.S. 332, 350 (1989).   \nNEPA\u2019s procedures are designed to facilitate a ro-\nbust discussion among the agency and the public \nabout the potential effects of an agency action.  Id. at \n352.  This \u201cinformational purpose\u201d is two-fold:  to pro-\nvide \u201cthe public the assurance that the agency has in-\ndeed considered environmental concerns in its deci-\nsionmaking process, and, perhaps more significantly, \n[to] provide[] a springboard for public comment in the \nagency decisionmaking process itself.\u201d  Dep\u2019t of \nTransp. v. Pub. Citizen, 541 U.S. 752, 768 (2004) \n(quoting Balt. Gas & Elec. Co. v. Nat. Res. Def. Coun-\ncil, Inc., 462 U.S. 87, 97 (1983)).  In other words, \nNEPA \u201censure[s] that the larger audience can provide \ninput as necessary to the agency making the relevant \ndecisions.\u201d  Id. \n\n5 \n \nThus, for certain \u201cmajor Federal actions signifi-\ncantly affecting the quality of the human environ-\nment,\u201d an agency must prepare an environmental im-\npact statement (EIS).  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4332(2)(C) (2023).  \nAs explained by NEPA\u2019s implementing regulations, is-\nsued by the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ), \nthe \u201cprimary purpose\u201d of an EIS is \u201cto serve as an ac-\ntion-forcing device by ensuring agencies consider the \nenvironmental effects of their action in decision mak-\ning, so that the policies and goals defined in the Act \nare infused into the ongoing programs and actions of \nthe Federal Government.\u201d  40 C.F.R. \u00a7 1502.1(a).  To \naccomplish this goal, an EIS \u201cshall provide full and \nfair discussion of significant effects and shall inform \ndecision makers and the public of reasonable alterna-\ntives that would avoid or minimize adverse effects or \nenhance the quality of the human environment.\u201d  \nId. \u00a7 1502.1(b). \nAs originally enacted, NEPA required an EIS to in-\nclude a discussion of, among other factors, the \u201cenvi-\nronmental impact of the proposed action\u201d and \u201cany ad-\nverse environmental effects which cannot be avoided \nshould the proposal be implemented.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 4332(2)(C)(i)-(ii) (1970).  In 2023, in a bipartisan re-\nvision of NEPA known as the BUILDER Act, Congress \ncodified the longstanding doctrine regarding the scope \nof the effects that an agency must consider.  See Fiscal \nResponsibility Act of 2023, Pub. L. No. 118-5, \u00a7 321, \n137 Stat. 10, 38-46.  The statute now makes explicit \nthat an EIS must address the \u201creasonably foreseeable \nenvironmental effects of the proposed agency action\u201d \nand \u201cany reasonably foreseeable adverse environmen-\ntal effects which cannot be avoided should the pro-\nposal be implemented.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 4332(2)(C)(i)-(ii) \n(2023) (emphasis added).   \n\n6 \n \nThe \u201creasonably foreseeable\u201d qualifier comes from \nCEQ\u2019s longstanding regulations, which likewise direct \nagencies to assess \u201creasonably foreseeable\u201d environ-\nmental effects.  43 Fed. Reg. 55,978, 56,004 (Nov. 29, \n1978) (40 C.F.R. \u00a7 1508.8(b) (1979)).  Those regula-\ntions define \u201creasonably foreseeable\u201d as \u201csufficiently \nlikely to occur such that a person of ordinary prudence \nwould take it into account in reaching a decision.\u201d  85 \nFed. Reg. 43,304, 43,376 (July 16, 2020) (40 C.F.R. \n\u00a7 1508.1(aa) (2021)); 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 1508.1(ii). \n2. NEPA requires extensive inter-agency coopera-\ntion with respect to preparation of an EIS.  The stat-\nute anticipates that one agency\u2019s actions will some-\ntimes have environmental effects either regulated by, \nor within the expertise of, another agency.  The first \nagency does not get to pass the buck to the second.  \nRather, by statute, they work together:  \u201cthe lead \nagency shall consult with and obtain the comments of \nany Federal agency which has jurisdiction by law or \nspecial expertise with respect to any environmental \nimpact involved.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4332(2)(C) (2023).  CEQ \nregulations further \u201cemphasize agency cooperation\u201d \nin the NEPA process, and delineate a system of \u201clead\u201d \nand \u201ccooperating\u201d agencies.  40 C.F.R. \u00a7 1501.8(a).  \nWhen \u201cmore than one Federal agency\u201d is \u201cinvolved in \nthe same action,\u201d then the \u201cparticipating Federal \nagencies shall determine \u2026 which agency will be the \nlead agency\u201d based on a set of factors, among them, \nwhich agency has \u201c[p]roject approval or disapproval \nauthority,\u201d the \u201c[m]agnitude of [each] agency\u2019s in-\nvolvement,\u201d and the agencies\u2019 \u201c[e]xpertise concerning \nthe \naction\u2019s \nenvironmental \neffects.\u201d \n \nId. \n\u00a7\u00a7 1501.7(a)(1), (c).  \u201cUpon request of the lead agency, \nany Federal agency with jurisdiction by law shall be a \ncooperating agency,\u201d and cooperating agencies with \n\n7 \n \n\u201cspecial expertise\u201d can be asked to prepare relevant \nportions of an EIS.  Id. \u00a7\u00a7 1501.8(a), (b)(3).  State and \nlocal agencies can also be \u201ccooperating\u201d agencies, so \nthe EIS process can incorporate their views and ex-\npertise as well.  Id. \u00a7 1501.8(a). \nB.  Railroad Regulation by the Surface \nTransportation Board \nUnder the ICC Termination Act of 1995 (ICCTA), \nthe Surface Transportation Board (Board) has exclu-\nsive jurisdiction over the interstate rail network, in-\ncluding \u201ctransportation by rail carriers\u201d and \u201cthe con-\nstruction, acquisition, [and] operation\u201d of railway \nlines.  49 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 10501(b)(1)-(2).  Constructing and \noperating a new railroad line requires the Board\u2019s ap-\nproval.  See id. \u00a7\u00a7 10901(a), 10902(a).     \nTo receive the necessary authorization, a party has \ntwo options.  The first is to submit an application de-\ntailing the proposed use of the line, including certain \noperational, financial, and environmental data.  See \n49 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1150.1 et seq.  After entertaining public \ncomment, the Board must issue the certificate unless \nit \u201cfinds that such activities are inconsistent with the \npublic convenience and necessity.\u201d  49 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 10901(c).  \nUnder an alternative pathway\u2014the one petition-\ners followed here\u2014a party may seek an exemption \nfrom the application process.  The Board may grant \nan exemption only if it determines, among other \nthings, that a full application proceeding \u201cis not nec-\nessary to carry out the transportation policy of\u201d 49 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 10101.  Id. \u00a7 10502(a).  Section 10101, in \nturn, declares that, \u201c[i]n regulating the railroad in-\n\n8 \n \ndustry, it is the policy of the United States Govern-\nment\u201d to take fifteen specified actions\u2014including, for \nexample, \u201cto operate transportation facilities and \nequipment without detriment to the public health and \nsafety\u201d and \u201cto encourage and promote energy conser-\nvation.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 10101(8), (14).   \nThus, in deciding whether to allow a new rail line, \nthe Board considers not only competition and effi-\nciency, but also environmental considerations rele-\nvant to \u201cthe public health and safety.\u201d  The Board has \n\u201cauthority to deny [an] exemption petition if the envi-\nronmental harm caused by the railway outweighs its \ntransportation benefits.\u201d  Pet.App.36a.  For this rea-\nson, the Board\u2019s decisionmaking regularly entails as-\nsessing environmental consequences, and the Board \nmaintains its own in-house experts in an Office of En-\nvironmental Analysis (OEA). \nThe Board recognizes that it must follow NEPA\u2019s \nrequirements, including to prepare an EIS.  The \nBoard\u2019s regulations specify that an \u201cEnvironmental \nImpact Statement will normally be prepared for rail \nconstruction proposals,\u201d except in certain specific cir-\ncumstances \nnot \napplicable \nhere. \n \n49 \nC.F.R. \n\u00a7 1105.6(a)-(b).  The Board also applies its own envi-\nronmental requirements, which direct an applicant \nfor a rail construction project to submit an \u201c[e]nviron-\nmental [r]eport\u201d describing a range of effects on land \nuse, energy, air quality, noise, safety, biological re-\nsources, and water.  Id. \u00a7 1105.7(e).   \nThe environmental report must include an evalua-\ntion of \u201cindirect or down-line impacts\u201d of rail construc-\ntion when certain thresholds are met, as they were \nhere.  Id. \u00a7 1105.7(e)(11)(v).  The Board will include an \nanalysis of potential effects on air quality if a decision \n\n9 \n \nwill result in an increase of either three or eight trains \na day on a given line, depending on whether certain \npollutants in the relevant areas exceed air-quality \nstandards.  Id. \u00a7\u00a7 1105.7(e)(5)(i)(A), (11)(v).  The \nBoard has determined that these same three- or eight-\ntrain thresholds should govern the Board\u2019s review of \ndownline safety issues, and it regularly applies these \nthresholds to define the downline study area for a par-\nticular project.  J.A.483-484; see also Pet.App.39a.    \nII. Factual Background \nA. The Board Prepares an EIS and Approves \nthe Railway \n1. In May 2020, petitioners sought approval from \nthe Board to build the Railway to connect the Uinta \nBasin in northeast Utah to the national rail network.  \nPet.App.6a-7a.  \u201c[N]o one disputes\u201d that the \u201cpredom-\ninant and expected primary purpose\u201d of the Railway \nis to transport \u201cwaxy crude oil produced in the Uinta \nBasin.\u201d  Pet.App.7a.   \nThe Railway would connect at Kyune, Utah, to an \nexisting railway line operated by the Union Pacific \nRailroad Company (the Union Pacific or UP Line).  \nCrude oil shipped out of the Uinta Basin on the Rail-\nway and bound for points east\u2014which would be 90% \nof the oil, J.A.513\u2014would have no way to travel except \nby the UP Line between Kyune and Denver, Colorado.  \nFor about half of that stretch, including the portion \ncrossing respondent Eagle County (the County), the \nUP Line follows the upper Colorado River.  Thus, nine \nout of ten trains carrying crude oil out of the Uinta \nBasin would take the UP Line along the Colorado \nRiver\u2014and cross through the County.  J.A.513-514; \n\n10 \n \nPet.App.12a, 113a; see also J.A.7-8, 42-43.  Each train \ncan be nearly 2 miles in length.  C.A.App.888.   \n2.  Petitioners sought an exemption for the Rail-\nway under 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10502.  Pet.App.6a-8a.  The \nBoard\u2019s OEA determined that an EIS was necessary; \nset the scope of study for the EIS based on public in-\nput, 84 Fed. Reg. 68,274 (Dec. 13, 2019); and pub-\nlished a Draft EIS on October 30, 2020.  During the \ncomment period, the Board received over 1,900 sub-\nmissions.  J.A.115-116.  The Final EIS followed on Au-\ngust 6, 2021.  Pet.App.76a.  \nAs relevant to the County, the EIS identified a set \nof \u201cdownline impacts,\u201d referring to \u201cimpacts that could \noccur along existing rail lines as a result of increased \nrail traffic due to the addition of new trains originat-\ning or terminating on the proposed rail line.\u201d  J.A.511; \nsee 84 Fed. Reg. at 68,278.  \u201cIncreased rail traffic \nwould have the greatest impacts on the segment of the \nexisting UP rail line between Kyune and Denver be-\ncause this segment is the longest existing rail line seg-\nment in the downline study area and would receive \nthe most new rail traffic if the proposed rail line were \nconstructed.\u201d  J.A.202.   \nOEA calculated that the UP Line would experience \nan increase in traffic of up to 9.5 additional trains per \nday.  J.A.294; C.A.App.886, 888.  And based on that \nforecast, OEA determined that \u201csome downline im-\npacts are reasonably foreseeable.\u201d  J.A.511.  Relying \non national data for train accident rates, J.A.487-490, \nOEA determined that the UP Line would experience a \nsignificant increase in the risk of rail accidents, rang-\ning between a 40% jump in a low traffic scenario to \n\u201cmore than two times\u201d the current risk in a high traf-\nfic scenario.  J.A.202.  This increase translates to up \n\n11 \n \nto 0.89 additional predicted accidents per year involv-\ning a loaded oil train on the UP Line.  J.A.203.  In \nother words, \u201caccidents involving a loaded crude oil \ntrain would occur slightly less than once per year un-\nder the high rail traffic scenario\u201d as a result of con-\nstruction of the Railway.  Id.  \nOEA further determined that approximately 26% \nof these accidents would result in an oil spill.  J.A.495-\n496.  Put slightly differently, once every four years the \nenvironment adjacent to the Union Pacific Line will \nface an oil spill.  Id.  And given the size of a train, the \nvast majority (almost 75%) of those spills will involve \n30,000 gallons or more of oil.  Id.    \nThe EIS also discussed the increased risk of wild-\nfires near the UP Line.  As OEA explained, trains \u201ccan \ncontribute to wildfires by providing an ignition \nsource,\u201d most commonly exhaust sparks (carbon par-\nticles emitted from the locomotive engine) or matter \nfrom overheated brakes.  J.A.282.  Among other fac-\ntors, grade changes\u2014which are unavoidable as a train \ncrosses the Rocky Mountains, for instance\u2014are a sig-\nnificant factor for exhaust-spark fires.  See id.  Matter \nfrom overheated brakes also starts fires.  Id. \nOEA recognized that \u201c[t]rains originating or termi-\nnating on the [Railway] could be an ignition source for \nwildfires along existing rail lines outside of the study \narea.\u201d  J.A.284-285.  Despite that, OEA reasoned that, \n\u201cbecause those existing rail lines are active rail lines \nthat have been in operation for many years, construc-\ntion and operation of the proposed rail line would not \nintroduce a new ignition source for wildfires along the \ndownline segments.\u201d  J.A.285.  OEA also determined \nthat there was a \u201clow\u201d probability that a train would \ncause a wildfire based on historic data on the causes \n\n12 \n \nof wildfires in Utah between 1992 and 2015.  J.A.245-\n246.  OEA thus concluded that \u201cthe downline wildfire \nimpact of the proposed rail line would not be signifi-\ncant.\u201d  J.A.285.  \nThe EIS notably did not evaluate the effect of the \ndownline increase in rail traffic on the Colorado River, \ndespite its proximity to the UP Line along much of the \nrelevant \nstretch. \n \nPet.App.46a; \nJ.A.206-242; \nC.A.App.902-949.  Rather, OEA\u2019s analysis of the im-\npacts on water resources pertained solely to the area \ndirectly adjacent to the new Railway in Utah\u2014specif-\nically, the watershed study area that the Railway it-\nself would cross, along with a \u201c1,000-foot-wide corri-\ndor along much of the rail centerline.\u201d  C.A.App. 902. \n3.  Following issuance of the final EIS, the Board \ngranted petitioners\u2019 exemption petition and author-\nized construction and operation of the Railway in De-\ncember 2021.  Pet.App.74a-189a.  The Board deter-\nmined that \u201cthe transportation merits of the project \noutweigh the environmental impacts,\u201d Pet.App.121a, \nlargely adopting OEA\u2019s environmental analysis from \nthe EIS, Pet.App.84a-85a.   \nThe Board \u201cadopt[ed] OEA\u2019s reasonable analysis \nconcerning wildfires,\u201d including its analysis that be-\ncause the \u201cexisting rail lines are active rail lines that \nhave been in operation for many years, construction \nand operation of the Line would not introduce a new \nignition source for wildfires along the downline seg-\nments.\u201d  Pet.App.94a.  The Board did not separately \ndiscuss the EIS\u2019s analysis of effects from downline rail \naccidents, nor did it address the potential impact on \nthe Colorado River. \n\n13 \n \nBoard Member Oberman dissented on the basis \nthat the \u201cproject\u2019s environmental impacts outweigh its \ntransportation merits.\u201d  Pet.App. 23a.    \nB. The Board\u2019s Decision and EIS Are \nVacated On Multiple Grounds \nThe County and several environmental organiza-\ntions petitioned for review of the Board\u2019s decision.  \nThe D.C. Circuit granted the petitions in part, denied \nthem in part, vacated the underlying order and part \nof the EIS, and remanded to the Board.  Pet.App.1a-\n71a. \n1. The court of appeals agreed with the County \nthat the Board made several foundational errors in as-\nsessing the Railway\u2019s downline impacts.1  None of the \ncourt\u2019s analysis of downline impacts turned on fore-\nseeability. \nFirst, the court concluded that OEA erred in deter-\nmining that \u201cthe downline wildfire impact of the pro-\nposed rail line would not be significant.\u201d  Pet.App.42a.  \nOEA\u2019s determination rested on its conclusion that the \n\u201cconstruction and operation of the [Railway] would \nnot introduce a new ignition source for wildfires along \nthe downline segments,\u201d because the rail lines are \u201cac-\ntive rail lines that have been in operation for many \nyears.\u201d  Pet.App.42a-43a.  The court characterized \nthis conclusion as \u201cutterly unreasoned,\u201d \u201cnot the \u2018hard \nlook\u2019 that NEPA requires.\u201d Pet.App.44a-45a.  Regard-\nless of whether new trains are a new type of ignition \nsource, the court explained that the \u201csignificant in-\ncrease in the frequency of which existing ignition \nsources travel\u201d the Union Pacific Line\u2014\u201cup to 9.5 new \n \n1 The court also identified APA violations separate from NEPA.  \nPet.App.50a-69a. \n\n14 \n \ntrains a day\u201d\u2014\u201cequally poses an increased risk of \nfire.\u201d  Id. \nSecond, the court of appeals agreed with the \nCounty that the Board erred by failing to evaluate ad-\nverse impacts on downline water resources, in partic-\nular the \u201csensitive\u201d Colorado River that \u201cparallels the \nUnion Pacific Line.\u201d  Id.  As the court explained, the \nrecord had \u201cno evidence \u2026 that the Board even con-\nsidered the potential impacts on water resources \ndownline of running up to 9.5 loaded oil trains a day \non the Union Pacific Line\u2014about 50% of which abuts \nthe Colorado River,\u201d even though the County, the \nState of Colorado, and others had squarely raised \nthose concerns.  Pet.App.46a; see J.A.8-9, 23-24 (dis-\ncussing the effect of an oil spill on the Colorado River, \na \u201cwater supply for millions\u201d).  Indeed, the \u201cBoard con-\ncededly fail[ed] altogether to mention the Colorado \nRiver in the Final EIS\u2019s discussion of impacts on wa-\nter resources.\u201d  Pet.App.46a.  Again, this analysis was \nnot the \u201chard look\u201d NEPA requires. Id. at 47a. \nFinally, the court of appeals concluded that the \nBoard erred by modeling the risk of rail accidents \nbased on generalized national data.  Pet.App.41a.  As \nthe court explained, OEA failed to account for the par-\nticular \u201clikelihood of derailment for long trains carry-\ning oil through the Mountain West.\u201d  Id.  It also as-\nsumed with no foundation \u201cthat accident rates for \nloaded trains would be the same as those for empty \ntrains.\u201d  Id.  When commenters identified this prob-\nlem, OEA shrugged that \u201cinsufficient data exist\u201d on \nthe accident rates for oil trains.  Id.  But when relying \non a lack of information, the court of appeals held, the \nEIS must at least explain \u201cwhy the information was \n\n15 \n \nunavailable and what actions the agency took to ad-\ndress that unavailability.\u201d  Pet.App.41a-42a; see also \n40 C.F.R. \u00a7 1502.22(b) (2020) (outlining process for \ncontending with \u201cincomplete or unavailable infor-\nmation\u201d relevant to an EIS).2  Once again, OEA thus \n\u201cfailed to take a \u2018hard look\u2019 at the increased risk of rail \naccidents downline given the increased rail traffic re-\nsulting from the Railway.\u201d  Id. at 40a.3 \n2. Separately from its discussion of downline im-\npacts, the court of appeals concluded that OEA erred \nin failing to consider the impacts of increased crude oil \nrefining along the Gulf Coast.  The court disagreed \nwith OEA that these effects were not reasonably fore-\nseeable, and further rejected the argument that OEA \nwas not required to consider these effects on the basis \nthat it could not \u201cregulate or mitigate\u201d these impacts.  \nPet.App.30a-31a.     \n3. In light of the \u201csignificant\u201d \u201cdeficiencies\u201d in the \nBoard\u2019s analysis, the court of appeals concluded that \nthe Board had improperly approved the Railway.  \nPet.App.70a.  As the court explained, the \u201cpoor envi-\nronmental review alone renders arbitrary the Board\u2019s \nconsideration of the relevant Rail Policies and the fi-\nnal order\u2019s exemption of the Railway.\u201d  Id.  The court \n \n2 This provision is now found in 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 1502.21.  See 85 Fed. \nReg. at 43,366-67. \n3 The court of appeals did not accept the County\u2019s and environ-\nmental groups\u2019 arguments in their entirety, instead undertaking \na careful, nuanced assessment of each downline impact.  To take \none example, the court rejected the environmental groups\u2019 argu-\nment that OEA failed to take a hard look at the geological risk of \nlandslides attributable to the Railway downline.  Pet.App.48a-\n50a.  \n\n16 \n \ntherefore vacated the underlying approval and part of \nthe EIS and remanded the case to the Board.     \nSUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT \nThe Court should affirm the D.C. Circuit\u2019s vacatur \nof the Board\u2019s analysis of downline impacts in Colo-\nrado.  The Board properly concluded that certain \ndownline impacts were reasonably foreseeable and \ntherefore needed to be included in the Board\u2019s evalua-\ntion of whether to approve the Railway.  The Board \nerred, however, by relying on demonstrably incorrect \nassumptions or otherwise faulty premises when eval-\nuating the magnitude of those effects.  As the D.C. Cir-\ncuit recognized, the Board\u2019s determination therefore \nfailed to comply with NEPA\u2019s well-established \u201chard \nlook\u201d requirement.  There is no basis for disturbing \nthis straightforward, highly factbound component of \nthe decision below.   \nI.  Petitioners\u2019 belated objection to the D.C. Cir-\ncuit\u2019s evaluation of downline impacts in Colorado is \nnot properly before the Court.  The petition for certio-\nrari limited its challenge to the D.C. Circuit\u2019s holding \nthat the Board erred in declining to consider the up-\nstream and downstream effects of oil and gas develop-\nment.  While the D.C. Circuit\u2019s analysis of this issue \nwas correct, it does not bear on the separate, highly \nfactbound question whether the Board correctly eval-\nuated downline impacts (e.g., wildfires, rail accidents, \nand water contamination) in Colorado.  Critically, un-\ntil petitioners\u2019 opening brief before this court, no one\u2014\nthe Board included\u2014questioned whether these down-\nline impacts were reasonably foreseeable and there-\nfore properly part of the Board\u2019s analysis.  Regardless \nof the answer to the question presented, this Court \n\n17 \n \nshould not disturb the D.C. Circuit\u2019s vacatur with re-\nspect to downline impacts.   \nII.  Petitioners\u2019 approach to NEPA is wrong.  Par-\nticularly after the BUILDER Act, petitioners have no \nchoice but to accept that NEPA requires agencies to \nevaluate the \u201creasonably foreseeable\u201d impacts of a fed-\neral action.  As reflected both by decades of circuit \nprecedent and by CEQ regulations, whether an effect \nis reasonably foreseeable turns on the materiality of \ninformation for the decisionmaker.  If an effect is suf-\nficiently likely to occur that a prudent person would \ntake it into account in reaching a decision, then it is \nreasonably foreseeable.  See, e.g., Sierra Club v. \nMarsh, 976 F.2d 763, 767 (1st Cir. 1992); 40 C.F.R. \n\u00a7 1508.1(ii). \nThis standard does not, and should not, mirror the \nscope of private tort liability.  The purpose of NEPA is \nto inform both the agency and the public of the im-\npacts of a particular project.  Limiting this review to \neffects that could give rise to tort liability flouts \nNEPA\u2019s directive to consider indirect effects, and more \nfundamentally conflicts with NEPA\u2019s goal of ensuring \nthat the agency and the public writ large are informed \nof the reasonably foreseeable outcomes of a project. \nNor is the scope of NEPA review properly limited \nto those effects over which the lead agency has exclu-\nsive or even primary jurisdiction.  As reflected by this \ncase, NEPA includes a comprehensive scheme for co-\noperation among both state and federal agencies.  \nWhen a particular effect falls within the expertise of \na different agency, NEPA contemplates that the \nagency will participate in the EIS process as a cooper-\nating agency\u2014and not, as petitioners appear to con-\ntemplate, that an effect can simply fall by the wayside \n\n18 \n \nbecause it is not in the wheelhouse of the agency in \ncharge of the EIS.       \nIII.  Applying these well-established standards, \nthe D.C. Circuit correctly determined that the Board \nerred in its evaluation of downline impacts.  As the \ncourt recognized, OEA\u2019s evaluation of the magnitude \nof these impacts rested on a series of fundamental er-\nrors.  Nothing in petitioners\u2019 amorphous concept of \nforeseeability, or their references to the \u201crule of rea-\nson,\u201d justifies ignoring these significant defects in the \nagency\u2019s NEPA analysis.  \nFirst, OEA disregarded the increased risk of wild-\nfires from the significant increase in train traffic.  \nOEA concluded that additional trains crossing the \nUnion Pacific Line would not be a new type of ignition \nsource, but as OEA recognized elsewhere in the same \nEIS, the increased risk comes from the greater fre-\nquency of trains.   \nSecond, OEA entirely failed to evaluate the effect \nthat the increase in rail traffic will have on the Colo-\nrado River, even though the river abuts half of the UP \nLine.  The Board\u2019s post hoc suggestion that it could \nuse OEA\u2019s evaluation of the impacts on waterways in \nUtah as a stand-in is both procedurally improper and \nfactually flawed. \nFinally, OEA incorrectly evaluated the risk of ac-\ncidents\u2014a fundamental underpinning of its entire re-\nview of downline effects\u2014by relying on national rates \nof derailment.  This project would involve a significant \nincrease in long trains loaded with crude oil travers-\ning difficult terrain in the Mountain West.  Given \nthese three significant errors, the D.C. Circuit \n\n19 \n \nproperly vacated the portion of the EIS evaluating \ndownline impacts in Colorado.   \nARGUMENT \nI. The Court of Appeals\u2019 Evaluation of \nDownline Impacts Is Not Implicated By The \nQuestion Presented. \nThe question presented is about foreseeability un-\nder NEPA, but petitioners have opportunistically \ntried to smuggle in more.  They ask this Court to val-\nidate the Board\u2019s EIS in its entirety\u2014but several \nflaws in the EIS are outside the question on which this \nCourt granted certiorari.  Indeed, petitioners\u2019 entire \nmerits theory has shifted substantially from their pe-\ntition, and the split they claimed needed resolution \nhas disappeared from their briefing.   \nEagle County demonstrated below several failures \nof the Board\u2019s EIS that had nothing to do with the \nBoard\u2019s approach to reasonable foreseeability.  The \nBoard did not attempt to argue that either NEPA or \nits own authorizing statute allowed it to ignore the \nrisks of wildfires caused by trains, oil spills caused by \nderailments, and other effects on the Colorado River \nnext to the UP Line.  To the contrary, it concluded that \nthese possibilities were reasonably foreseeable, \nPet.App.110a, and proceeded to consider them.  See \nGov\u2019t Br. 40.  And petitioners did not dispute the fore-\nseeability of those effects.  Nor did the decision below, \nwhich held that the Board had failed to take the nec-\nessary \u201chard look\u201d at these potential consequences of \na decision to let the Railway proceed.   \nPetitioners therefore brought to the Court a ques-\ntion that does not encompass the substance of that \n\u201chard look\u201d review.  Rather, they contended that what \n\n20 \n \nneeded review was whether NEPA \u201crequires an \nagency to study environmental impacts beyond the \nproximate effects of the action over which the agency \nhas regulatory authority.\u201d  Pet. i.  Specifically, they \ncontended that the court of appeals had erred in \u201cor-\nder[ing] the Board to study the local effects of oil wells \nand refineries that lie outside the Board\u2019s regulatory \nauthority.\u201d  Pet. i (emphasis added).  The petition con-\ntained no argument at all about \u201cdownline\u201d impacts \nalong the UP Line, such as wildfires and oil spills. \nBut now petitioners want the Court to validate the \nBoard\u2019s entire EIS and hold that wildfire, oil spills, \nand river pollution are too remote from the Board\u2019s \ndecision on the Railway\u2014or, perhaps, excused from \nconsideration by some more nebulous \u201crule of reason.\u201d  \nTheir position is incorrect, as shown below, but the \nCourt need not even consider it.  Any challenge to the \ncourt of appeals\u2019 evaluation of downline impacts in \nColorado is not \u201cfairly included\u201d within the question \npresented.  See Izumi Seimitsu Kogyo Kabushiki Kai-\nsha v. U.S. Philips Corp., 510 U.S. 27, 31-32 (1993); S. \nCt. Rule 14.1(a). \nPut another way, the answer to the question pre-\nsented will not affect the D.C. Circuit\u2019s decision to va-\ncate the Board\u2019s NEPA analysis as arbitrary and ca-\npricious.  Because the Board and the D.C. Circuit \nagreed that the downline impacts are reasonably fore-\nseeable effects of the regulatory action over which the \nBoard has regulatory authority, their analysis of \nthose impacts did not implicate the supposed circuit \nsplit that petitioners asked this Court to resolve.   \nPetitioners have now all but dropped any mention \nof that split, see Petrs. Br. 5-6 (briefly suggesting in \nthe Background that some circuits \u201ctake a decidedly \n\n21 \n \nmore balanced view\u201d of the scope of NEPA review), but \npetitioners\u2019 own description of the purported split il-\nlustrates that it does not implicate the downline im-\npacts raised by the County.  See id.  Petitioners argue \nthat their preferred circuits make clear that \u201cagencies \nneed only study effects that are both proximate and \nenvironmental and do not fall outside the agency\u2019s \nscope of authority.\u201d  Id.  The Board never suggested \nthat the increased risk of wildfire started by sparks \nfrom a train, or the increased risk of an oil spill into \nthe Colorado River caused by a train accident, were \nnot proximate, not environmental, or outside the \nscope of its authority. \nThe Government agrees:  It does not argue for re-\nversal of the entirety of the court\u2019s NEPA analysis, but \nonly the \u201cportion of the court of appeals\u2019 decision\u201d ad-\ndressing \u201cthe upstream and downstream effects of oil \nand gas development.\u201d  Gov\u2019t Br. 45.   \nThus, the outcome of this case cannot save the \nBoard\u2019s NEPA analysis.  The County prevailed on its \narbitrary-and-capricious claims because the Board\u2019s \nanalysis of downline impacts was simply not an ade-\nquate \u201chard look\u201d\u2014not because of a lack of foreseea-\nbility or a lack of regulatory authority.  And petition-\ners cannot bring the entire EIS within the scope of this \nCourt\u2019s review just by sprinkling the term \u201crule of rea-\nson\u201d over everything.  \nII. The Scope of EIS Review Turns on the \nMateriality of Information to the \nDecisionmaking Process. \nOn the merits of the legal standard, petitioners os-\ncillate between asking the Court merely to restate its \n\n22 \n \nholdings in Metropolitan Edison and Public Citizen, \nand asking for something far more extreme.   \nTo the extent petitioners argue\u2014as they must\u2014\nthat NEPA requires agencies to consider reasonably \nforeseeable environmental effects, that reasonable \nforeseeability is not but-for causation, and that an \nagency need not study an effect that it has no author-\nity to consider in its decision, then all parties and the \ncourt below are in agreement.  Many of petitioners\u2019 \nstraw-man arguments about supposedly \u201cunlimited\u201d \nprocess simply disregard these well-settled limita-\ntions. \nBut petitioners attempt to sneak new limitations \ninto these well-established principles\u2014a rule equat-\ning the scope of NEPA review with the boundary of \ntort liability, and a free-floating version of the \u201crule of \nreason\u201d that would let agencies decline to study effects \nthey would rather ignore.  Those limitations find no \nsupport in the text, structure, decades-long history, or \ncongressional understanding of NEPA.  And adopting \nthem would substantially restrict the ability of states, \nlocalities, and the public to meaningfully participate \nin decisions regarding the federal actions that will \nsubstantially impact their communities. \nA. NEPA Has Long Been Understood to \nExtend to \u201cReasonably Foreseeable\u201d \nImpacts. \nAs originally enacted, NEPA directed agencies to \nprepare an EIS evaluating \u201cthe environmental impact \nof [a] proposed action\u201d and \u201cany adverse environmen-\ntal effects which cannot be avoided should the pro-\nposal be implemented.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4332(2)(C)(i)-(ii) \n\n23 \n \n(1970).  The statute did not define either \u201cenvironmen-\ntal impact\u201d or \u201cenvironmental effect[],\u201d but from the \noutset, courts and agencies alike interpreted this pro-\nvision to require agencies to evaluate environmental \neffects that are reasonably foreseeable.  That con-\ncept\u2014reasonable foreseeability\u2014has now been made \nexplicit in the statute, in the 2023 amendment post-\ndating the Board\u2019s EIS. \nThe earliest NEPA decisions recognized that an \nEIS \u201cneed not review all possible environmental ef-\nfects of a project,\u201d but rather those that are \u201creasona-\nbly foreseeable.\u201d  Swain v. Brinegar, 542 F.2d 364, 368 \n(7th Cir. 1976).  Thus, while NEPA does not \u201cdemand \nwhat is, fairly speaking, not meaningfully possible,\u201d it \ndoes require agencies \u201cto describe the reasonably fore-\nseeable environmental impact\u201d of the program under \nconsiderations.  Scientists\u2019 Inst. for Pub. Info., Inc. v. \nAtomic Energy Comm\u2019n, 481 F.2d 1079, 1092 (D.C. \nCir. 1973).  In other words, the statute compels some \n\u201c[r]easonable forecasting.\u201d  Id. \nCEQ adopted the \u201creasonably foreseeable\u201d stand-\nard in its regulations almost five decades ago.  43 Fed. \nReg. at 56,004 (40 C.F.R. \u00a7 1508.8(b) (1979)); 87 Fed. \nReg. 23,453, 23,466-67 (Apr. 20, 2022) (40 C.F.R. \n\u00a7 1508.1(g) (2022)).  Under the regulations both then \nand now, agencies must consider the \u201cdirect,\u201d \u201cindi-\nrect,\u201d and \u201ccumulative\u201d effects of an action.  40 C.F.R. \n\u00a7 1508.1(i).   Direct effects \u201care caused by the action \nand occur at the same time and place\u201d; indirect effects \nare \u201creasonably foreseeable\u201d effects that \u201care caused \nby the action\u201d but \u201care later in time or farther removed \nin distance\u201d; and \u201ccumulative\u201d effects are \u201ceffects on \nthe environment that result from the incremental ef-\nfects of the action when added to the effects of other \n\n24 \n \npast, present, and reasonably foreseeable actions re-\ngardless of what agency (Federal or non-Federal) or \nperson undertakes such other actions.\u201d  Id.  \nCongress then added the \u201creasonably foreseeable\u201d \nstandard to NEPA in 2023.  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4332(2)(C)(i) \n(2023).  An earlier draft of the BUILDER Act would \nhave directed agencies to consider \u201creasonably fore-\nseeable environmental effects with a reasonably close \ncausal relationship to the proposed agency action.\u201d  \nH.R. 2515, 117th Cong., \u00a7 2(a)(3)(B)(i).  But the ver-\nsion of the bill that ultimately passed maintained only \nthe \u201creasonably foreseeable\u201d requirement; it excised \nthe phrase \u201creasonably close causal relationship.\u201d  See \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4332(2)(C)(i) (2023).4  It likewise dropped \nparticular temporal and geographic limits on what \nagencies needed to evaluate.  See H.R. 2515, supra, \n\u00a7 2(b) (proposed new NEPA \u00a7 109(13)).  The final Act \nrequires agencies to \u201cinclude in every recommenda-\ntion or report on proposals for legislation and other \nmajor Federal actions significantly affecting the qual-\nity of the human environment, a detailed statement \nby the responsible official on (i) reasonably foreseeable \nenvironmental effects of the proposed agency action \n[and] (ii) any reasonably foreseeable adverse environ-\nmental effects which cannot be avoided should the \n \n4 From 2020 to 2022, CEQ briefly included the same \u201creasonably \nclose causal relationship\u201d language in its NEPA regulations.  40 \nC.F.R. \u00a7 1508.1(g) (2020).  CEQ reverted to the prior language in \n2022, asking solely whether an effect was reasonably foreseeable.  \n87 Fed. Reg. at 23,453.  In so doing, it explained that the phrase \n\u201creasonably close causal relationship\u201d was \u201cunnecessary and un-\nhelpful because an agency\u2019s ability to exclude effects too attenu-\nated from its actions is adequately addressed by the longstanding \nprinciple of reasonable foreseeability that has guided NEPA \nanalysis for decades.\u201d  87 Fed. Reg. at 23,465. \n\n25 \n \nproposal be implemented.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4332(2)(C) \n(2023).   \nRather than unsettle the concept of reasonable \nforeseeability, Congress chose to include reforms in \nthe BUILDER Act that would speed the NEPA process \nin other ways.  Most notably, the BUILDER Act im-\nposed page and time limitations on NEPA review and \nadopted exclusions from NEPA\u2019s requirements.  42 \nU.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 4336a(e), (g) (2023), 4336e(10)(B) (2023). \nB. Reasonable Foreseeability Turns on the \nMateriality of Information for the \nDecisionmaker. \n1.  NEPA \u201cdoes not mandate particular results,\u201d \nbut rather \u201cprescribes the necessary process\u201d to en-\nsure that the choice will be a well-informed one.  Rob-\nertson, 490 U.S. at 350.  The EIS process in particular \nis designed to ensure \u201cthat the relevant information \nwill be made available to the larger audience that may \nalso play a role in both the decisionmaking process \nand the implementation of that decision.\u201d  Id. at 349.  \nBy engaging in this process, agencies are \u201cmore likely \nto consider the views of those who live and work in the \nsurrounding community\u201d when evaluating a particu-\nlar project.  Council on Environmental Quality, Exec-\nutive Office of the President, The National Environ-\nmental Policy Act:  A Study of Effectiveness After \nTwenty-Five Years 7 (1997).  And, as a corollary, agen-\ncies are less likely to \u201csteamroll local communities \nwith federal projects.\u201d  Robert L. Glicksman & Alejan-\ndra E. Camacho, The Trump Card: Tarnishing Plan-\nning, Democracy, and the Environment, 50 ENV. L. \nREP. 10281, 10282 n.12 (Apr. 2020) (quoting a Colo-\nrado official\u2019s description of NEPA).  Ultimately, \nNEPA\u2019s \u201cfundamental objective is promoting good \n\n26 \n \ngovernment and democratic decisionmaking.\u201d  Id. at \n10283.  \nReflecting these principles, the touchstone of the \nreasonable foreseeability standard is the materiality \nof information for the decisionmaker.  Agency officials \nshould consider effects that will inform whether to \nmove ahead with a project.  For decades, then, circuits \nacross the country have defined an environmental \nconsequence as \u201creasonably foreseeable\u201d when it is \nsufficiently likely to occur that a prudent person \nwould take it into account in reaching a decision.   \nThe First Circuit articulated this consensus stand-\nard in Sierra Club v. Marsh, 976 F.2d 763, 767 (1st \nCir. 1992).  There the court explained that the \u201c\u2018duty\u2019 \nto discuss in the EIS\u201d is \u201cmeasured by an objective \nstandard.\u201d  Id.  \u201cThat is, a likelihood of occurrence, \nwhich gives rise to the duty, is determined from the \nperspective of the person of ordinary prudence in the \nposition of the decisionmaker at the time the decision \nis made about what to include in the EIS.\u201d  Id.  Apply-\ning this standard, agencies \u201cneed not consider poten-\ntial effects that are highly speculative or indefinite.\u201d  \nId. at 768.  And \u201c[w]hether a particular set of impacts \nis definite enough to take into account, or too specula-\ntive to warrant consideration,\u201d turns on the relevance \nand usefulness of particular information to the \nagency\u2019s decisionmaking process.  Id.  The First Cir-\ncuit elaborated:  \u201cWith what confidence can one say \nthat the impacts are likely to occur?\u201d  Id.  And \u201c[c]an \none describe them \u2018now\u2019 with sufficient specificity to \nmake their consideration useful?\u201d  Id.  The \u201cordinary \nprudence\u201d standard became the settled understand-\ning of whether a particular impact was reasonably \nforeseeable.  E.g., Solar Energy Indus. Ass\u2019n v. FERC, \n\n27 \n \n80 F.4th 956, 995 (9th Cir. 2023); Dine Citizens \nAgainst Ruining Our Env\u2019t v. Bernhardt, 923 F.3d \n831, 853 (10th Cir. 2019); Ctr. for Biological Diversity \nv. U.S. Army Corps of Eng\u2019rs, 941 F.3d 1288, 1293 \n(11th Cir. 2019); EarthReports, Inc. v. FERC, 828 F.3d \n949, 955 (D.C. Circ. 2016); Ark. Wildlife Fed\u2019n v. U.S. \nArmy Corps of Engineers, 431 F.3d 1096, 1102 (8th \nCir. 2005); La. Crawfish Producers Ass\u2019n-W v. Rowan, \n463 F.3d 352, 358 (5th Cir. 2006).   \n2.  This definition is now in CEQ\u2019s regulations as \nwell.  See 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 1508.1(ii).  In 2020, CEQ \u201cpro-\npose[d] to define \u2018reasonably foreseeable\u2019 consistent \nwith the ordinary person standard\u2014that is what a \nperson of ordinary prudence would consider in reach-\ning a decision.\u201d  85 Fed. Reg. 1,684, 1,710 (Jan. 10, \n2020).  It then adopted this definition in the 2020 final \nrule, citing the First Circuit\u2019s decision in Sierra Club \nv. Marsh to explain the \u201cordinary prudence\u201d standard.  \n85 Fed. Reg. at 43,351.   \nCEQ maintained this definition in its 2022 regula-\ntions, explaining that agencies \u201care not required to \n\u2018foresee the unforeseeable\u2019 or engage in speculative \nanalysis,\u201d but are required to evaluate \u201cwhat a person \nof ordinary prudence would consider in reaching a de-\ncision.\u201d  89 Fed. Reg. 35,442, 35,550 (May 1, 2024).  \nWhile commenters suggested various changes to this \nformulation, CEQ responded that it was \u201cunaware of \nany practical challenges or confusion that has arisen \nfrom connecting this definition to the ordinary per-\nson,\u201d and it saw no need to \u201ccreate uncertainty\u201d by \nchanging the regulatory text.  Id.   \n3.  This decades-old understanding of \u201creasonable \nforeseeability\u201d plainly informed Congress\u2019s decision to \ncodify that standard in the BUILDER Act.   That is \n\n28 \n \nnot just the ordinary presumption when codifying an \nadministrative interpretation\u2014that is also what the \nChair of the House Natural Resources Committee con-\nfirmed.  He explained that, \u201cin amending NEPA to in-\nclude the concept of reasonable foreseeability, Con-\ngress intends to establish in statute Sierra Club v. \nMarsh, 976 F.2d 763 (1st Cir. 1992).\u201d  169 Cong. Rec. \nH2704 (daily ed. May 31, 2023) (remarks of Rep. \nWesterman).   \n4.  The Government adopts a differently worded \nformulation, suggesting that an agency may \u201cfind that \nthe requisite causal connection is absent or dimin-\nished where the scope of the agency action and the na-\nture and requirements of the governing statutes ren-\nder a particular harm too attenuated, speculative, \ncontingent, or otherwise insufficiently material to the \nagency decision under consideration.\u201d  Gov\u2019t Br. 27.  \nThis standard is difficult to evaluate in the abstract, \nand the Government (properly recognizing the scope \nof the question presented and the nature of the deci-\nsion below) does not apply it to the agency\u2019s evaluation \nof downline impacts in Colorado.   \nTo the extent it captures the question whether a \nparticular impact will \u201cinfluence the agency\u2019s deci-\nsionmaking\u201d or \u201cprovide \u2018a springboard\u2019 for meaning-\nful public comments,\u201d Gov\u2019t Br. 27 (quoting Public Cit-\nizen, 541 U.S. at 768), the government\u2019s reformulation \nmay not be a substantial revision.  But this standard \ncannot be used as a free pass\u2014akin to versions of Pe-\ntitioners\u2019 rule of reason theory\u2014to decline to study \ncertain environmental effects otherwise within \nNEPA\u2019s scope.  In particular, as described in the brief \nfor the Environmental Respondents, NEPA does not \n\n29 \n \npermit agencies to decline to study reasonably fore-\nseeable effects just because they deem them \u201cother-\nwise insufficiently material\u201d\u2014separate and apart \nfrom being \u201ctoo attenuated, speculative, [or] contin-\ngent.\u201d  See Br. of Env\u2019t Resps. at 43-44. \nC. The NEPA Reasonable Foreseeability \nStandard Is Broader Than Tort Liability. \nPetitioners rely on Metropolitan Edison Co. v. Peo-\nple Against Nuclear Energy, 460 U.S. 766 (1983), and \nDepartment of Transportation v. Public Citizen, 541 \nU.S. 752, 754 (2004), to argue that the NEPA reason-\nable foreseeability standard equates to tort law\u2019s \nstandard of proximate cause.  Petrs. Br. 4, 16, 23.  It \nis noncontroversial that NEPA\u2019s causal requirement \nis, as the Court put it in Public Citizen, \u201cakin to\u201d prox-\nimate cause.  541 U.S. at 754.  The concept of \u201cproxi-\nmate cause\u201d has been consistently invoked by the \ncourts of appeals\u2014including the D.C. Circuit, which \npetitioners repeatedly criticize\u2014to underscore that \nNEPA does not require agencies to consider every but-\nfor cause of a particular project.  See Sierra Club v. \nFERC, 867 F.3d 1357, 1380-81 (D.C. Cir. 2017) (using \nthe concept of \u201cproximate cause\u201d to explain that \u201cthe \nfact that [an agency\u2019s] action is a \u2018but for\u2019 cause of an \nenvironmental effect is insufficient to make it respon-\nsible for a particular environmental effect\u201d); Sierra \nClub v. FERC, 827 F.3d 36, 47 (D.C. Cir. 2016) (same).   \nPetitioners are wrong, however, to the extent they \nsuggest that the scope of NEPA review should be co-\nextensive with the scope of tort liability\u2014a fictitious \nscope at that, because the federal government is not \nactually liable in tort even for harm proximately \ncaused by its \u201cdiscretionary\u201d decisions, see 28 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 2680(a).  This Court specifically said in Metropolitan \n\n30 \n \nEdison that it \u201cd[id] not mean to suggest\u201d any such \nstrict equivalence with tort liability.  460 U.S. at 774 \nn.7.  Nor would one make sense in a statute that reg-\nulates the process of agency decisionmaking rather \nthan substantive outcomes.  NEPA is a \u201clook before \nyou leap\u201d statute; properly informed, the agency can \nleap even if it will cause a tort on the way down, and \nit would be incoherent to argue that it can just ignore \nevery consequence that would not be tortious.   \n1.  Petitioners contend that \u201cMetropolitan Edison \nall but resolves this case.\u201d  Petrs. Br. 21-22.  Metropol-\nitan Edison bears little resemblance to this case, par-\nticularly as to the downline effects highlighted by the \nCounty.  While petitioners attempt to wrench a favor-\nable legal standard from the decision, the Court took \npains to explain that it \u201cd[id] not mean to suggest\u201d ex-\nactly what petitioners now say it held.  460 U.S. at 774 \nn.7.   \nIn Metropolitan Edison, this Court concluded that \nthe Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) was not \nrequired to account for the possibility that the risk of \nan accident at Three Mile Island\u2019s nuclear power \nplant \u201cmight cause harm to the psychological health \nand community well-being of residents of the sur-\nrounding area.\u201d  Id. at 768.  As the Court explained, \npsychological health problems were not effects on \u201cthe \nair, land and water,\u201d and were therefore \u201csimply too \nremote from the physical environment to justify re-\nquiring the NRC to evaluate\u201d them.  Id. at 773-774.  \nThe Court further emphasized that any psychological \nhealth effects would stem from the risk of an accident, \nand not from reopening the nuclear plant.  Id. at 775.  \nNEPA, however, \u201cdoes not require agencies to evalu-\nate the effects of risk, qua risk.\u201d  Id. at 779.    \n\n31 \n \nIn explaining that NEPA requires \u201ca reasonably \nclose causal relationship between a change in the \nphysical environment and the effect at issue,\u201d the \nCourt likened this requirement to \u201cthe familiar doc-\ntrine of proximate cause from tort law.\u201d  Id. at 774.  \nThe Court clarified, however, that in \u201cdrawing this \nanalogy,\u201d it \u201cd[id] not mean to suggest that any cause-\neffect relation too attenuated to merit damages in a \ntort suit would also be too attenuated to merit notice \nin an EIS \u2026\u201d  Id. at 774 n.7.  Rather, \u201c[i]n the context \nof both tort law and NEPA, courts must look to the \nunderlying policies or legislative intent in order to \ndraw a manageable line between those causal changes \nthat may make an actor responsible for an effect and \nthose that do not.\u201d  Id.  \nThe Court repeated its reference to \u201cproximate \ncause\u201d in Public Citizen, which involved the suffi-\nciency of NEPA review by the Federal Motor Carrier \nSafety Administration (FMCSA) in implementing \nsafety regulations governing Mexican trucks in the \nUnited States.  541 U.S. at 759-61.  The regulations \nwere prompted by the President\u2019s lifting of a morato-\nrium preventing Mexican trucks from entering the \ncountry; FMCSA was charged with creating a post-\nmoratorium \u201csafety-inspection regime\u201d for these \ntrucks.  Id. at 759-60.  As FMCSA explained, it did not \n\u201cconsider any environmental impact that might be \ncaused by the increased presence of Mexican trucks \nwithin the United States,\u201d as that increase was at-\ntributable to the President\u2019s decision to lift the mora-\ntorium, and not to FMCSA\u2019s implementation of the \nnew safety regulations.  Id. at 761-762.   \nThe Court agreed with the agency\u2019s approach, ex-\nplaining that FMCSA had no \u201cability to countermand \n\n32 \n \nthe President\u2019s lifting of the moratorium or otherwise \ncategorically to exclude Mexican motor carriers from \noperating within the United States.\u201d  Id. at 766.  To \nthe contrary, FMCSA was obligated by statute to reg-\nister any Mexican carrier that was \u201cwilling and able \nto comply with the various substantive requirements \nfor safety and financial responsibility contained in \nDOT regulations.\u201d  Id.   The Court declined to accept \nthe challengers\u2019 \u201cunyielding variation of \u2018but for\u2019 cau-\nsation, where an agency\u2019s action is considered a cause \nof an environmental effect even when the agency has \nno authority to prevent the effect.\u201d  Id. at 767. \n2.  As the Government notes (Br. 34), this Court \nrecognized in Metropolitan Edison and Public Citizen \nthat reasonable foreseeability does not extend to the \nlimits of but-for causation.  The Court\u2019s references to \n\u201cproximate cause\u201d just reinforce that an agency need \nnot consider everything from which a project \u201ccould \nconceivably be a but-for cause.\u201d  Sierra Club, 827 F.3d \nat 46; see also Vill. of Bensenville v. FAA, 457 F.3d 52, \n65 (D.C. Cir. 2006) (\u201cEven under NEPA, a \u2018but for\u2019 \ncausal relationship is insufficient to make an agency \nresponsible for a particular effect.\u201d).  \u201cInstead, the ef-\nfect must be \u2018sufficiently likely to occur that a person \nof ordinary prudence would take it into account in \nreaching a decision.\u2019\u201d  Id. at 47 (quoting City of Shore-\nacres v. Waterworth, 420 F.3d 440, 453 (5th Cir. \n2005)); see supra, pp. 26-28.  \n\u201c[T]he term \u2018proximate cause\u2019 is shorthand for a \nconcept:  Injuries have countless causes, and not all \nshould give rise to legal liability.\u201d  CSX Transp., Inc. \nv. McBride, 564 U.S. 685, 692 (2011).  The phrase thus \ncaptures \u201cthe policy-based judgment that not all fac-\ntual causes contributing to an injury should be legally \n\n33 \n \ncognizable causes.\u201d  Id. at 701.  Proximate cause has \ntaken \u201cmany shapes,\u201d including both the \u201cconcepts of \ndirect relationship and foreseeability.\u201d  Hemi Grp., \nLLC v. City of N.Y., 559 U.S. 1, 12 (2010).   The use of \nthe phrase \u201cproximate cause\u201d in the NEPA context \nmerely illustrates the well-established principle that \nthe scope of an EIS is not governed by a standard of \nbut-for causation..  See, e.g., Husted v. A. Philip Ran-\ndolph Inst., 584 U.S. 756, 769 (2018) (explaining that \n\u201cthe law recognizes several types of causation\u201d and \ndistinguishing \u201cbut-for cause\u201d from \u201cproximate \ncause\u201d).   \n3.  Petitioners latch on to the Court\u2019s reference to \nproximate cause\u2014while failing to mention the Court\u2019s \nfootnote disclaiming the tort-law analogy\u2014and argue \nthat NEPA\u2019s \u201creasonably foreseeable\u201d standard turns \non the application of tort law\u2019s proximate cause stand-\nard.  Petrs. Br. 4, 16, 23.  Petitioners push these prin-\nciples to the breaking point by equating NEPA review \nwith the limits of tort liability.  According to Petition-\ners, if \u201crespondents brought a tort claim against STB \non the theory that approving\u201d the Railway \u201cproxi-\nmately caused downline rail accidents\u201d in Colorado, \n\u201cthey would be laughed out of court.\u201d Petrs. Br. 2.  In \nother words, they ask this Court to hold that an \nagency needs to consider an effect during its adminis-\ntrative decisionmaking only if the agency might be \nheld liable in a trial court for any injury arising from \nthat effect.   \nPetitioner seem to be suggesting that NEPA does \nnot require an agency making a decision even to con-\nsider any consequence that the agency will not have \nto pay for in tort damages.  But it is well-established \n\n34 \n \nthat NEPA requires a process, not a particular out-\ncome.  The Board can determine, for example, that the \nrisk of environmental harm is justified by the trans-\nportation benefits of a particular project.  See Robert-\nson, 490 U.S. at 351.  Because the agency\u2019s NEPA ob-\nligation is limited to properly evaluating and account-\ning for the risk of environmental consequences, it \nmakes little sense to apply the same standards that \nwould govern the agency\u2019s liability for a substantive \noutcome if the agency\u2019s substantive decisionmaking \nwere not immunized from tort liability anyway, see su-\npra, p. 30.  \nFor that reason, neither Metropolitan Edison nor \nPublic Citizen held or even suggested that NEPA re-\nview is coextensive with tort liability.  To the contrary, \nas noted, the Court expressly cautioned in Metropoli-\ntan Edison that its invocation of proximate cause did \nnot suggest that \u201cany cause-effect relation too attenu-\nated to merit damages in a tort suit would also be too \nattenuated to merit notice in an EIS.\u201d  460 U.S. at 774 \nn.7.  Petitioners\u2019 \u201claughed out of court\u201d theory cannot \nbe squared with the statute.5  \n \n5 Petitioners do not go so far as to expressly attempt to divorce \nproximate cause under NEPA from reasonable foreseeability.  \nNor could they, particularly after the BUILDER Act.  While this \nCourt has noted in the damages context that \u201cforeseeability alone \ndoes not ensure the close connection that proximate cause re-\nquires,\u201d these decisions were grounded in concern for unbounded \nmonetary liability.  Bank of Am. Corp. v. City of Miami, 581 U.S. \n189, 202-03 (2017).  Under NEPA, by contrast, where what is at \nstake is not monetary compensation but well-informed agency \naction, reasonable foreseeability has always been the operative \ntest. \n\n35 \n \nD. Petitioners\u2019 Suggestion That the \u201cRule of \nReason\u201d Allows Agencies to Pass the \nBuck Contradicts NEPA\u2019s Scheme of \nInteragency Cooperation. \nPetitioners\u2019 remaining arguments fall into a cate-\ngory that they call the \u201crule of reason.\u201d  While they try \nto hitch onto references in this Court\u2019s NEPA deci-\nsions, they actually seek to break up the NEPA pro-\ncess into agency-specific silos that the statutory text \nexpressly rejects.  Petitioners contend that \u201creason\u201d \nrequires an agency with statutory authority to con-\nsider environmental consequences not to use it, but to \npass the buck to other agencies based on relative ex-\npertise.  NEPA requires no such thing:  it expressly \ncontemplates a coordinated environmental review \nthat brings all relevant agencies\u2019 expertise to bear in \na single assessment. \n1.  The \u201crule of reason\u201d is not a more stringent ver-\nsion of reasonable foreseeability that an agency can \ninvoke whenever it wishes.  Rather, it serves as a nar-\nrow addendum to the reasonable foreseeability stand-\nard\u2014namely, that where consideration of a particular \neffect \u201cwould serve \u2018no purpose\u2019 in light of NEPA\u2019s reg-\nulatory scheme as a whole,\u201d then the agency is not re-\nquired to consider that effect.  Public Citizen, 541 U.S. \nat 767. \nPublic Citizen provides an apt example.  Applying \nthe \u201crule of reason,\u201d the Court concluded that FMCSA \nwas not required to evaluate the environmental ef-\nfects created by the presence of Mexican trucks in the \nUnited States.  Id. at 768; see also supra, pp. 31-32.  \nFMCSA\u2019s decision-making process was constrained:  \nit had no power to just refuse to carry out its statutory \n\n36 \n \ntask because it thought the environmental conse-\nquences too grave.  Id.  In that unique circumstance, \nrequiring FMCSA to study this impact would not \nserve NEPA\u2019s goal to \u201cprovid[e] a springboard for pub-\nlic comment in the agency decisionmaking process.\u201d  \nId. at 768 (internal quotations omitted).  FMCSA had \nno ability to provide a \u201clarger audience\u201d with the op-\nportunity for meaningful input when FMCSA had no \nauthority to \u201cact on whatever input this \u2018larger audi-\nence\u2019 could provide.\u201d  Id. at 769.   \nHere, by contrast, it is \u201cconceded[]\u201d that the \nBoard\u2019s \u201cexclusive jurisdiction over the construction \nand operation of the railway\u201d includes the \u201cauthority \nto deny the exemption petition if the environmental \nharm caused by the railway outweighs its transporta-\ntion benefits.\u201d  Pet.App.36a.  While agencies need not \nconsider effects on which their decisions have no bear-\ning, an agency with authority to weigh environmental \nconsequences in deciding whether to approve of a fed-\neral action does have authority to prevent any harm \nthat would flow from that project.  \nPetitioners twist the rule of reason into something \ndifferent, to argue that even if the Board has authority \nto consider environmental consequences, it has no ob-\nligation to learn what those consequences may be be-\nfore exercising that authority.  Petitioners contend \nthat the issues in this case are \u201cfar outside [the \nBoard\u2019s] limited remit, but well within the purview of \nother agencies\u2019 authority,\u201d and urge that \u201cthose other \nagencies can address such issues more comprehen-\nsively.\u201d  Petrs. Br. 26.  Much like Petitioners\u2019 proxi-\nmate cause theory, it is not clear how far Petitioners \nbelieve this rule should extend.  As the Government \nnotes, if Petitioners are merely repeating the holding \n\n37 \n \nof Public Citizen, then that is a noncontroversial \nstatement of governing law:  NEPA requires agencies \nto assess the effects of their actions, not effects they \nhave no authority to control.  See 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 4332(2)(C) (2023); Gov\u2019t Br. 31.  But petitioners are \nwrong to the extent they suggest that NEPA imposes \na \u201cprimary jurisdiction\u201d limitation (Petrs. Br. 24)\u2014\ni.e., that agencies need only evaluate effects they are \ndirectly charged with regulating.6 \nA \u201cprimary jurisdiction\u201d approach is squarely in-\nconsistent with NEPA, which requires extensive in-\nteragency cooperation.  See supra, pp. 6-7.  The stat-\nute expressly states that the agency leading the EIS \nprocess \u201cshall consult with and obtain the comments \nof any Federal agency which has jurisdiction by law or \nspecial expertise with respect to any environmental \nimpact involved.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4332(2)(C) (2023).  \nNEPA thus envisions that multiple federal, state, and \nlocal agencies will have separate or overlapping juris-\ndiction over aspects of the effects at issue, and will col-\nlectively participate in the EIS process under the lead \nof a single agency\u2014precisely as occurred here.  \nJ.A.111-114; C.A.App.823-825.  The EIS process does \nnot require an agency to stray far outside its exper-\ntise; rather, the lead agency has the authority to ask \ncooperating agencies to assume responsibility for as-\npects of the environmental analysis, particularly in \nareas for \u201cwhich the cooperating agency has special \nexpertise.\u201d  40 C.F.R. \u00a7 1501.8(b)(3).   \n \n6 The question presented asks whether an agency must study ef-\nfects \u201cbeyond the proximate effects of the action over which the \nagency has regulatory authority.\u201d  Pet. i (emphasis added).  After \nthe question presented, however, petitioners\u2019 brief never again \nuses the phrase \u201cregulatory authority.\u201d      \n\n38 \n \n2.  Petitioners\u2019 approach cannot be squared with \nthis federal scheme.  It is the rare federal action that \ndoes not involve impacts cutting across agency lines.  \nIn every other case, several agencies will have juris-\ndiction and expertise over the effects of an action be-\ning taken by one of those agencies.  To the extent pe-\ntitioners suggest that a project should involve multi-\nple EIS processes, one for each involved agency, that \nwill lead to more process and more paperwork\u2014the \nprecise opposite of what petitioners believe should \nhappen.   \nPetitioners\u2019 remake of NEPA would mean that an \nagency can excise from consideration any effects that \nit deems more directly regulated by another agency.  \nAn agency would no have no obligation to consider, for \nexample, a project\u2019s effects on water and air, because \nthose domains fall within the jurisdiction of the EPA.  \nAnd an agency like STB would find itself with no \nNEPA obligations all\u2014notwithstanding the statutory \ncommand that \u201call agencies of the Federal Govern-\nment shall\u201d comply with the requirement to evaluate \nthe environmental effects of their actions.  42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 4332(2)(C) (2023). \n3.  Robertson v. Methow Valley Citizens Council, \n490 U.S. 332 (1989), is not to the contrary.  While not \nclear from petitioners\u2019 distorted description (Petrs. Br. \n24), Robertson primarily resolved whether NEPA re-\nquires an EIS to include \u201ca fully developed plan to mit-\nigate environmental harm.\u201d  Robertson, 490 U.S. at \n335-336.  The Court answered in the negative, ex-\nplaining in part that it will sometimes be infeasible \nfor an EIS to include \u201ca complete mitigation plan,\u201d in-\ncluding when certain effects (there, \u201coff-site effects on \nair quality and on the mule deer herd\u201d) could not be \n\n39 \n \nmitigated \u201cunless nonfederal government agencies \ntake appropriate action.\u201d  Id. at 352.  Because state \nand local authorities had jurisdiction over the rele-\nvant area and authority to mitigate the effects, it \nwould make little sense to conclude that the Forest \nService had \u201cno power to act until the local agencies \nha[d] reached a final conclusion on what mitigation \nmeasures they consider[ed] necessary.\u201d  Id. at 352-\n353.  \nThe decision in no way suggests that the Forest \nService could ignore these effects in its EIS.  To the \ncontrary, petitioners\u2019 quoted portion of the decision \nextols the values of a robust EIS, and the discussion \nof these effects in particular that the Forest Service \ndid not directly regulate.  Because \u201cthe adverse effects \non air quality and the mule deer herd [were] primarily \nattributable to predicted off-site development that \nw[ould] be subject to regulation by other governmen-\ntal bodies,\u201d a fulsome EIS served the purpose of \u201coffer-\ning those bodies adequate notice of the expected con-\nsequences and the opportunity to plan and implement \ncorrective measures in a timely manner.\u201d  Id. at 350.7  \n \n7 The Court separately rejected the argument that the agency \nwas required to consider the \u201cworst case\u201d scenario when as-\nsessing the environmental impact of a project.  490 U.S. at 354.  \nPetitioners\u2019 description notwithstanding, the case is not an ex-\nample of NEPA run amok.  As the Court\u2019s decision explains, prior \nCEQ regulations had provided that if an agency was unable to \nobtain certain data relevant to its evaluation, the agency instead \nhad to include a \u201cworst case analysis and an indication of the \nprobability or improbability of its occurrence.\u201d  Id. (quoting 40 \nC.F.R. \u00a7 1502.22 (1985)).  That regulation had been replaced by \nthe time of the review at issue in Robertson, and the Court disa-\ngreed with the court of appeals that the \u201cworst case\u201d requirement \nnonetheless still controlled.  490 U.S. at 354.  \n\n40 \n \n*  *  * \nNEPA is critical to ensuring that the public is in-\nformed about the potential environmental effects of an \nagency action.  The scope of NEPA evaluation thus \nturns on the information that an ordinary prudent \nperson would take into account when deciding \nwhether to proceed with a particular action. This \nstandard accords with the governing regulations, with \na consistent and extensive body of circuit caselaw, \nand, most fundamentally, with NEPA\u2019s animating \npurpose.  \nIII. The D.C. Circuit Correctly Identified \nMultiple Errors in the Board\u2019s NEPA \nReasoning, All Regarding Foreseeable \nEffects of the Railway.  \nThe environmental consequences of doubling the \ntrain traffic on the UP Line\u2014by adding lengthy trains \nfilled with crude oil, which will run right next to the \nColorado River\u2014fit any definition of reasonable fore-\nseeability.  More trains mean more sparks (and more \nwildfires) and more accidents.  The agency was re-\nquired to take a hard look at those consequences.  In-\ndeed, while the agency contended that it had taken a \nhard look, the agency did not disagree that it was re-\nquired to take one.  Nor did petitioners, at least not in \ntheir petition for certiorari.  Petitioners\u2019 belated at-\ntempt to dismiss these effects as too attenuated does \nnot square with the record or the law.    \n\n41 \n \nA. The Board Failed to Take the Requisite \nHard Look at a Series of Downline \nEnvironmental Effects.  \nPetitioners\u2019 caricature bears no resemblance to the \nactual D.C. Circuit fact-specific decision.  Far from de-\nmanding \u201cbottomless process,\u201d Petrs. Br. 43, the court \nrejected many of the challenges to the EIS.  \nPet.App.37a-39a, 48a-50a.  But for a couple of key \ndownline impacts\u2014wildfires, water contamination, \nand derailments of oil-bearing trains\u2014the court found \nthe EIS lacking.  While petitioners now suggest that \nthese downline impacts were not sufficiently foresee-\nable, neither the parties nor the Board nor the court \nof appeals saw it that way.  Rather, all agreed that \nthese impacts were reasonably foreseeable and \nneeded to be evaluated.  Petitioners\u2019 attempt to dis-\nmiss wildfires, water contamination, and oil spills as \ncategorically off the table completely fails to grapple \nwith the actual facts before the D.C. Circuit.  And pe-\ntitioners\u2019 contention that the court of appeals violated \nthe \u201crule of reason\u201d just confirms that petitioners are \nusing that term to encompass essentially anything in \na NEPA case that petitioners do not like. \n1. The Board\u2019s consideration of the \ndownline wildfire impact was \u201cutterly \nunreasoned.\u201d  \nAs the D.C. Circuit explained, the Board\u2019s conclu-\nsion that wildfire impact \u201cwould not be significant\u201d \n(J.A.285) suffered from two major errors.  First, the \nBoard decided that adding 9.5 new trains a day to the \nUP Line would not significantly increase the risk of \nwildfires because these trains \u201cwould not be a quali-\ntatively \u2018new ignition source.\u2019\u201d  Pet.App.44a.  In other \nwords, because the UP Line is currently host to some \n\n42 \n \n(low) number of trains, adding more trains would not \nincrease the risk of wildfires.  That conclusion is, as \nthe D.C. Circuit put it, \u201cutterly unreasoned.\u201d  Id.  \nMore trains mean more ignition sources; more igni-\ntion sources mean more sparks; and more sparks \nmean more wildfires.  See J.A.282-283; supra, p. 11.  \nRegardless of whether new trains are a new type of \nignition source, they are undoubtedly new ignition \nsources\u2014and \u201c[a] significant increase in the frequency \nof which existing ignition sources travel this route \nequally poses an increased risk of fire.\u201d  Pet.App.44a-\n45a.  Indeed, OEA itself repeatedly recognized in \nother sections of the EIS that \u201cmore trains could in-\ncrease the risk of sparking a wildfire.\u201d  J.A.259, 280.   \nA second mistake exacerbated this error.  The \nBoard reasoned that \u201ctrains make up a small percent-\nage of fire starts\u201d based on pre-2015 data from Utah, \nand concluded that \u201cthe probability that a train would \ntrigger a wildfire is very low.\u201d  J.A.284-285.  As the \nD.C. Circuit explained, however, that fails to grapple \nwith the \u201cconcededly \u2018low volume of rail traffic\u2019 on the \nUnion Pacific Line currently.\u201d  Pet.App.45a.   \n2. The Board entirely failed to address \nadverse impacts on the Colorado \nRiver.   \nFully half of the downline UP Line parallels the \n\u201csensitive\u201d Colorado River.  Pet.App.45a-46a.  Yet nei-\nther the Final EIS nor the Board\u2019s discussion of im-\npacts on water resources even mentioned the River.  \nPet.App.46a.  The Board conceded as much below, and \nconspicuously did not argue that impacts on the river \nare beyond the scope of a proper NEPA analysis.   \n\n43 \n \nInstead, on appeal it contended that it had done \nthe work, just by other means\u2014it had reviewed wa-\nterways in Utah, and its counsel posited that the im-\npacts to downline waterways would be \u201cthe same\u201d in \nColorado.  Pet.App.46a; see also C.A.App.906-911, \n939-948.  But that appears nowhere in the EIS or the \nBoard\u2019s approval decision, see Pet.App.46a-47a, and \nthe APA is not satisfied by the \u201cpost hoc rationaliza-\ntions\u201d by \u201cappellate counsel[].\u201d  Motor Vehicle Mfrs. \nAss\u2019n of U.S., Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., \n463 U.S. 29, 50 (1983). \nThe Colorado River, the \u201cmost important river in \nthe Southwest United States,\u201d raises unique consider-\nations.  J.A.8-9, 23-24.  Despite that, there \u201cis no evi-\ndence\u201d that the \u201cBoard even considered the potential \nimpacts on water resources downline of running up to \n9.5 loaded oil trains a day on the Union Pacific Line.\u201d  \nPet.App.46a.  Nor did the Board reconcile its conclu-\nsion with its finding that there would be \u201cmajor im-\npacts\u201d on Utah waterways from the Railway\u2019s con-\nstruction and operations, requiring significant mitiga-\ntion measures.  J.A.121-122, 240-242; C.A.App.1168.  \nIf the analysis really did apply equally to Colorado, \nthe Board needed to examine the corresponding \u201cma-\njor impacts\u201d on Colorado waterways.   \n3. The Board erred in assessing the \nimpact of train accidents.   \nThe shipment of crude oil poses serious risks.  \nJ.A.49-50.  In 2018, the federal Pipeline and Hazard-\nous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) re-\nported to Congress that the safety record of crude oil \nshipments by rail has been highly variable based on \ncertain \u201chigh-impact incidents.\u201d  J.A.49-50 (quoting \n\n44 \n \nU.S. Dep\u2019t of Transp., PHMSA, Report on Shipping \nCrude Oil by Truck, Rail and Pipeline, at 7, Fig. 3 \n(Oct. 2018), https://www.phmsa.dot.gov/news/report-\ncongress-shipping-crude-oil-truck-rail-and-pipeline).  \nAs the County put it:  \u201c[W]hen things go wrong with \nshipments of crude oil by rail, they go dramatically \nwrong.\u201d  J.A.50.     \nOEA accordingly recognized that downline rail ac-\ncidents could have a range of significant impacts, \namong them the release of toxic crude oil on land or \ninto the adjacent Colorado River and the possibility of \nstarting a fire.  J.A.199-201, 220-222.  But its assess-\nment of the accident rate was incorrect.    \nTo model the accident rate based on the increase \nin rail traffic on the Union Pacific Line, the Board \nused the national average of derailment accidents, \nwith no consideration of the location of the trains (the \nhighly variable and steep terrain of the Rocky Moun-\ntains) or their cargo (heavy crude oil).  C.A.App.1340.  \nNor did the EIS address the unique derailment risks \nposed by the particular trains that would be traveling \non the UP Line\u2014 \u201cheavy, long unit trains that would \nexclusively transport crude oil.\u201d  C.A.App.1340-1341. \nThe Board did not dispute these unique risks, but \ndisclaimed responsibility on the basis that \u201c[i]nsuffi-\ncient data were found on accident rates for unit trains \ncarrying crude oil.\u201d  J.A.519.  That does not cut it un-\nder NEPA, which expressly contemplates that agen-\ncies will sometimes have insufficient data available.  \nIf an agency lacks \u201cinformation relevant to reasonably \nforeseeable significant effects,\u201d the EIS must include \na \u201csummary of existing credible scientific evidence\u201d on \nthis topic, and the \u201cagency\u2019s evaluation of such effects \n\n45 \n \nbased upon theoretical approaches or research meth-\nods generally accepted in the scientific community.\u201d  \n40 C.F.R. \u00a7 1502.21(c). \nThe Board did not engage in any of this analysis:  \nIt \u201cconcededly relied on national freight train accident \nrates without explanation and assumed that loaded \nfreight trains were as likely to derail as unloaded \ntrains.\u201d  Pet.App.42a; see supra, pp. 10, 14.  Because \nthe Board \u201cfailed to respond to significant opposing \nviewpoints concerning the adequacy of its analyses of\u201d \nrail accidents, the D.C. Circuit correctly found its \nanalysis \u201cdeficient.\u201d  Pet.App.42a.    \nB. Petitioners Do Not Meaningfully \nChallenge the D.C. Circuit\u2019s Analysis of \nThese Downline Impacts.  \nPetitioners raise a set of scattershot arguments to \nthe D.C. Circuit\u2019s review of downline impacts.  None \nis persuasive.  \n1.  Petitioners first attempt to wave away all of the \nchallenges to the Board\u2019s approval on the basis that \nthey were too attenuated to merit consideration.  \nPetrs. Br. 13-14.  The County and the environmental \nchallengers objected to the EIS\u2019s treatment of several \ndifferent effects, among them the impact of oil refining \non the Gulf Coast; the potential effects of construction, \ndrilling, and truck traffic in the Uinta Basin; and \ndownline impacts involving rail accidents, wildfires, \nand water resources in Colorado.  Petrs. Br. 13-14; see \nsupra, pp. 41-45.  According to petitioners, the Board \nprovided a single, collective response to all of the ob-\njections\u2014namely, that it \u201cdid not need to consider \nthose far-downstream (or down-track) potentialities, \n\n46 \n \nall of which lay outside STB\u2019s limited remit,\u201d and none \nof which it could \u201caccurately predict.\u201d  Petrs. Br. 14. \nThat is a significant rewrite of the record.  For the \ndownline impacts addressed above, the Board in fact \nsaid the opposite.  As the Board recognized in its ap-\nproval decision, OEA examined a set of \u201creasonably \nforeseeable impacts that could occur outside the pro-\nject area as a result of construction and/or operation \nof trains using the Line\u201d (i.e., \u201cdownline impacts\u201d).  \nPet.App.110a.  OEA was able to assess these impacts \nprecisely because there were a \u201cpredicted number and \nlength of trains,\u201d a set of \u201clikely regional destinations\u201d \nand \u201cprojected reasonably foreseeable routes for this \ntraffic.\u201d  Pet.App.111a.  Taken together, this infor-\nmation allowed OEA to identify \u201ca downline impact \nstudy area eastward from Kyune to the northern, \nsouthern, \nand \neastern \nedges \nof \nthe \nDenver \nMetro/North Front range that met the Board\u2019s regula-\ntory thresholds for analysis.\u201d  Id.  This downline study \narea was defined in reference to Board regulations \nthat specify precisely when the Board must evaluate \ndownline impacts.  See 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 1105.7(e); supra, \npp. 8-9.  In other words, the downline impacts the \nBoard addressed made their way into consideration \nprecisely because they were reasonably foreseeable \nand had a sufficiently close causal relationship with \napproval of the Railway.   \n2.  Petitioners separately suggest that the in-\ncreased risk of downline train accidents does not re-\nsult in an environmental effect, and therefore does not \nfall within NEPA\u2019s ambit. Petrs. Br. 40-41.  According \nto petitioners, an accident might not \u201chave any mean-\ningful impact on the \u2018air, land and water,\u2019\u201d and there-\nfore would not pose an environmental risk that STB \n\n47 \n \nmust review under NEPA.  Petrs. Br. 40.  This argu-\nment fails several times over.  \nTo start, petitioners do not suggest the other two \ndownline impacts (the risk of wildfires and the impact \non the Colorado River) are not environmental.  Nor \ncould they:  these are clearly effects on the \u201cair, land \nand water\u201d that fall within the heartland of environ-\nmental risks.  Metro. Edison, 460 U.S. at 773, 775 (de-\nscribing \u201cincreased fog\u201d and \u201cthe release of warm wa-\nter into the Susquehanna River\u201d as direct environ-\nmental effects).  Thus, even assuming the risk of acci-\ndents is not an environmental effect, that does not call \ninto question the D.C. Circuit\u2019s conclusions that the \nBoard failed to conduct the requisite \u201chard look\u201d with \nrespect to downline impacts on wildfires and water re-\nsources.      \nPetitioners are also wrong that rail accidents that \nresult from adding the Railway and its oil-bearing \ntrains to the rail network are not an environmental \nimpact.  OEA itself describes the range of environ-\nmental consequences that could result from a rail ac-\ncident, whether on the Railroad or downline.  J.A.199-\n200, 220-222; see also supra, pp. 10-12.  Among other \noutcomes, \u201c[t]rain accidents or derailments could \ncause train cars to rupture or overturn and spill crude \noil or frac sand into the environment.\u201d  J.A.220.  \n\u201cUinta Basin crude oil is toxic, and an accidental re-\nlease would have negative effects on the environ-\nment.\u201d  J.A.221.  \u201cIf an accident were to release crude \noil near a waterway\u201d\u2014for example, the adjacent Col-\norado River\u2014\u201ccrude oil could enter the waterway, \nwhich would affect water quality.\u201d  J.A.199.  And \u201c[i]f \n\n48 \n \nthe force of the accident were sufficient to ignite the \ncrude oil, a fire could result.\u201d  J.A.200.8   \nPetitioners\u2019 respond that an accident is not certain \nto result in an environmental effect: a train might be \n\u201cunloaded or carrying innocuous cargo,\u201d resulting in \n\u201ca safety risk for the Federal Railway Administration \nto consider substantively\u2014but not an environmental \nrisk for STB to review under the auspices of NEPA.\u201d  \nPetrs. Br. 40.  The EIS, however, reports that on the \nUnion Pacific line, \u201caccidents involving a loaded crude \noil train would occur slightly less than once per year \nunder the high rail traffic scenario\u201d\u2014with a spill oc-\ncurring every four years.  J.A.202 (emphasis added).9  \nThese spills are concrete, predictable, environmental \neffects\u2014the core of what NEPA directs agencies to \nstudy.  Petitioners attempt to brush away these \n\u201cdownline accidents actually affecting the physical en-\nvironment\u201d as \u201cvanishingly narrow and remote,\u201d but \nroughly one accident per year involving a loaded crude \n \n8 Petitioners also obliquely suggest that the Railway would not \nproximately cause downline train accidents.  See Petrs. Br. 40.  \nThe Board did not see it that way:  It calculated a specific risk of \naccidents based on the increased train traffic, and then pro-\nceeded to evaluate the effects of those accidents.  See supra, \npp. 10-12.   \n9 Petitioners state that, \u201calthough STB estimated that marginal \nincreases in rail traffic could cause 0.89 new accidents per year, \naccidents involving a loaded crude train would occur far less fre-\nquently.\u201d  Petrs. Br. 15.  That is simply wrong:  \u201cOEA predicts \nthat accidents involving a loaded crude oil train would occur \nslightly less than once per year under the high rail traffic sce-\nnario.\u201d  J.A.203.  \n\n49 \n \noil train is hardly \u201cvanishingly narrow.\u201d  Petrs. Br. \n40.10 \nNor is an evaluation of these impacts comparable \nto the evaluation of \u201crisk, qua risk\u201d that the Court re-\njected in Metropolitan Edison.  Petrs. Br. 41.  There \nwas no question that the NRC needed to evaluate \u201cef-\nfects that will occur if\u201d the risk of a nuclear accident \nwere realized.  460 U.S. at 775 n.9.  Rather, NRC was \nnot required \u201cto evaluate the effects of risk, qua risk\u201d\u2014\ni.e., the psychological health effects engendered by \nconcerns about risk.  Id. at 779 (first emphasis added). \nEven putting all of that aside, the Board treated \nthe risk of rail accidents as an environmental effect \nthat it needed to evaluate under NEPA.  J.A.198 (dis-\ncussing the \u201c[e]nvironmental [c]onsequences\u201d of rail \naccidents).  The Board\u2019s decision cannot be upheld on \nthe theory\u2014entirely at odds with the Board\u2019s actual \nanalysis\u2014that these were non-environmental im-\npacts that it had no obligation to study under NEPA.  \nSee SEC v. Chenery Corp., 318 U.S. 80, 87 (1943).  \n3.  Finally, petitioners describe the D.C. Circuit as \ninvoking \u201ca rule of bottomless process, not a rule of \nreason.\u201d  Petrs. Br. 43.  Contrary to petitioners\u2019 mis-\ncharacterization, the court of appeals did not require \nthe Board to do just one more study.  Rather, it called \nout, correctly, glaring errors in the Board\u2019s analysis.  \nWhatever boundaries the rule of reason puts around \na NEPA study, it does not shield arbitrary deci-\n \n10 Petitioners\u2019 approach would have required the Board to ig-\nnore (as \u201cnot environmental\u201d) not just downline accidents, but \naccidents on the proposed Railway itself.  See J.A.222 (Board \nforecasting the accident rate on the Railway).  \n\n50 \n \nsionmaking on matters within that boundary.  \u201cRea-\nson\u201d does not support excluding agencies cannot ex-\ncuse themselves from the ordinary APA requirement \nof reasoned decisionmaking.  In other words, the \nBoard did not need to \u201cgo[] further\u201d\u2014it needed to \navoid relying on false premises and plainly inaccurate \ndata.   \nThe Board determined, correctly, that these down-\nline impacts were reasonably foreseeable.  See supra, \npp. 10-11.  It was therefore required to evaluate them \nunder the legal standard that all parties agree ap-\nplies.  It could not satisfy this requirement through a \nseries of deeply flawed determinations.  \n*  *  * \nThis Court is used to hearing litigants say that \ntheir adversaries\u2019 policy arguments would be better \naddressed to Congress.  This case is unusual because \nCongress has already addressed those arguments, in \nan amendment after the relevant agency action that \nis only indirectly before the Court here.  And it is even \nmore unusual because the answer to the question pre-\nsented cannot affect the outcome of this particular \ncase given the D.C. Circuit\u2019s decision on the County\u2019s \n\u201chard look\u201d claims.  And because the agency will have \nto re-do its NEPA analysis, the agency may well take \ninto account the amended statute if it chooses\u2014\nwhether this Court resolves the question presented in \nthe agency\u2019s favor or not.   \nTo try to avoid those consequences, petitioners \nhave substantially reconfigured their arguments be-\ntween the certiorari and merits stages in an attempt \nto convince this Court to reach well beyond the ques-\ntion presented.  But there is no occasion for the Court \n\n51 \n \nto do so.  Petitioners\u2019 merits arguments are not only \nincorrect, they are also completely disconnected from \nany division in the courts of appeals that they pre-\nsented at the certiorari stage.  And because this case \ninvolves the pre-amendment version of NEPA, it can \nshed light on the current statute only indirectly.  \nGiven the likelihood that a decision will neither affect \nthe outcome of this case nor clarify the law, the court \nmay wish to simply dismiss the writ as improvidently \ngranted. \nCONCLUSION \nIf the Court does not dismiss the writ, the judg-\nment should be affirmed. \nRespectfully submitted. \n \nNATHANIEL H.

          "task_beliefs": "My understanding of this case continues to solidify, moving from foundational facts to the core legal battleground. The core facts remain stable: the case concerns the scope of NEPA review for the Uinta Basin railway, specifically whether the STB was required to analyze \"downline\" and \"upline\" environmental effects.\n\nMy knowledge has been significantly advanced by analyzing the Brief for the Federal Respondents (the U.S. Solicitor General), which revealed:\n1.  **Government's Position:** The executive branch, via the Solicitor General, now supports the petitioners and argues for reversing the D.C. Circuit. This is a powerful signal, as the SG's views carry significant weight with the Court.\n2.  **Central Legal Argument:** The government's case rests on the principle of proximate causation, arguing that NEPA allows agencies to draw \"manageable, context-specific lines\" for their environmental analysis. They contend the STB acted reasonably in limiting its review.\n3.  **Controlling Precedent:** The argument is anchored in *Department of Transp. v. Public Citizen*, 541 U.S. 752 (2004). The government interprets this case to mean that an agency's NEPA obligations are limited by its statutory authority; it need not analyze effects it cannot prevent (like oil drilling or refining, regulated by other bodies).\n4.  **Causation Framework:** The dispute is framed as one of causation. The government argues that effects like increased oil drilling (\"upline\") or refining and combustion (\"downline\") are too attenuated and speculative to be considered legally cognizable effects of the railway authorization itself.\n5.  **Congressional Intent:** The government may use the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023, which amended NEPA to include a \"reasonably foreseeable\" standard, to argue that the D.C. Circuit's expansive view is contrary to recent legislative signals.\n\nBased on this, my prediction leans strongly toward a reversal of the D.C. Circuit. However, the latest observation\u2014an internal reflection\u2014tempers this prediction by explicitly acknowledging its one-sided nature. My current belief state now incorporates a critical element of uncertainty: I have a deep understanding of the argument for reversal but almost no information about the respondents' (Eagle County's) counterarguments. The most significant gap in my task-level knowledge is how the respondents will distinguish *Public Citizen* and what alternative framework for NEPA analysis they will propose. My prediction remains provisional until this opposing view is understood.",
          "design_beliefs": "My strategic framework for legal analysis has evolved significantly, moving from basic principles to a more nuanced and effective methodology.\n\n1.  **Foundational Beliefs (Stable):** The core strategies of **categorizing the legal question** (statutory interpretation, administrative law) and **analyzing primary source documents** remain the bedrock of my approach.\n2.  **Information Retrieval Strategy (Validated & Refined):** The **\"Reflect-Adapt-Retry\" cycle** has been validated as a superior method for information gathering. The initial failure to find a specific document led to a successful broader search, proving the value of iterative and flexible querying.\n3.  **Source Prioritization (Refined Heuristic):** I have refined my source hierarchy. While cert-stage petitions are useful, the most valuable documents for predicting an outcome are the **merits-stage briefs from the parties and key amici**. The brief from the U.S. Solicitor General, in particular, is a top-tier source due to the institutional role of the office.\n4.  **Predictive Signals (New & Refined Heuristics):**\n    *   **\"Always determine the position of the Solicitor General.\"** The SG's alignment, especially when it involves \"switching sides\" after a lower court loss, is a powerful predictive signal.\n    *   **\"Identify the key contested precedent.\"** Legal arguments often pivot on a single case. Focusing analysis on how both sides interpret, apply, or distinguish that key precedent (here, *Public Citizen*) is a highly efficient strategy for understanding the core of the dispute.\n5.  **Argument Analysis (New Heuristic):** The most recent observation has generated a crucial new strategic principle: **\"Actively seek out and model the counterargument.\"** A one-sided understanding, no matter how compelling, is insufficient for a robust prediction. Acknowledging the \"one-sidedness\" of my current knowledge and prioritizing the search for the respondent's brief demonstrates a move toward a more rigorous, dialectical approach. This ensures a balanced view and guards against confirmation bias.\n6.  **Process Methodology (New Heuristic):** I have learned the value of an explicit **\"Integrate-Reflect-Plan\" cycle.** After a significant information gain, the optimal next step is not to immediately search again, but to pause, integrate the new information into the existing belief structure, reflect on the largest remaining uncertainty, and then formulate a targeted plan to address it. This meta-cognitive loop makes the entire research process more efficient and directed."

L. No. 91-190, 83 Stat. 852 (42 \nU.S.C. 4321 et seq.), and this Court\u2019s precedents estab-\nlish several basic principles regarding the appropriate \ncontours of an environmental impact statement.  First, \nan agency must analyze the \u201creasonably foreseeable en-\nvironmental effects of the proposed agency action.\u201d  42 \nU.S.C. 4332(2)(C)(i).  Second, the term \u201c\u200a\u2018environmental \neffect\u2019  * * *  include[s] a requirement of a reasonably \nclose causal relationship\u201d between the agency action \nand the particular environmental harm.  Metropolitan \nEdison Co. v. People Against Nuclear Energy, 460 U.S. \n766, 774 (1983).  An agency may therefore draw \u201cman-\nageable\u201d lines concerning causation that look to \u201cthe un-\nderlying policies behind NEPA and Congress\u2019 intent, as \n\n2 \n \ninformed by the \u2018rule of reason.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Department of \nTransp. v. Public Citizen, 541 U.S. 752, 767 (2004) (ci-\ntation omitted).  Third, when an agency makes a deter-\nmination under this framework about the scope of its \nenvironmental impact statement, a reviewing court \n\u201cmust assume\u201d that the agency has \u201cexercised [its] dis-\ncretion appropriately\u201d \u201c[a]bsent a showing of arbitrary \naction.\u201d  Kleppe v. Sierra Club, 427 U.S. 390, 412 (1976).   \nThe non-federal respondents nonetheless contend \nthat an agency must consider every environmental con-\nsequence that is reasonably foreseeable as a factual \nmatter.  That contention is incorrect.  This Court\u2019s prec-\nedents make clear that NEPA permits agencies to limit \ntheir environmental analyses based on whether and to \nwhat extent the proposed federal action is the \u201clegally \nrelevant cause\u201d of the effects.  Public Citizen, 541 U.S. \nat 769.  An agency may therefore make a reasonable, \ncontext-specific determination that\u2014based on the scope \nof the proposed action and the provisions of the agency\u2019s \ngoverning statutes\u2014a harm is too attenuated, specula-\ntive, contingent, or otherwise insufficiently material to \nwarrant additional consideration, or any consideration \nat all, in an environmental impact statement. \nAt the same time, petitioners go too far to the extent \nthey ask this Court to impose the same standard of \nproximate cause that applies in tort suits.  The common \nlaw of torts is distinct from the statutory requirements \nin NEPA and serves different purposes.  Agencies can-\nnot woodenly apply tort standards\u2014or the other cate-\ngorical limits petitioners sometimes appear to advocate \n\u2014where doing so would produce a result that contra-\nvenes NEPA\u2019s underlying policies and its rule of rea-\nson.   \n\n3 \n \nThe Surface Transportation Board (Board) properly \napplied those principles in this case.  The Board made a \nreasonable, context-specific determination that it did \nnot need to provide additional analysis of the upstream \nand downstream effects of oil and gas development and \nrefining in its environmental impact statement.  Accord-\ningly, the court of appeals erred in vacating that portion \nof the Board\u2019s decision.  This Court should so hold and \nremand to the court of appeals.  The Court should de-\ncline petitioners\u2019 request to reach beyond the question \npresented to consider aspects of the court of appeals\u2019 \ndecision that were not challenged in the petition for a \nwrit of certiorari.   \nA. NEPA Permits Agencies To Draw Manageable, Context-\nSpecific Lines In Determining The Scope Of Their  \nEnvironmental Impact Statements \nNEPA\u2019s text requires a federal agency to produce a \n\u201cdetailed statement\u201d examining the environmental ef-\nfects of a proposal for a \u201cmajor Federal action[] signifi-\ncantly affecting the quality of the human environment.\u201d \n42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C).  As the government explained in \nits opening brief (at 19-20), that procedural require-\nment is the primary means through which Congress vin-\ndicated its express intent to develop a \u201cnational envi-\nronmental policy,\u201d under which all federal agencies \nwork to \u201cprevent or eliminate damage to the environ-\nment\u201d and improve public health and welfare, while also \nenhancing understanding of the environment.  42 U.S.C. \n4321, 4331 (emphasis omitted).  But NEPA\u2019s core pro-\ncedural requirement has important limits.   \nAs all parties agree, an agency does not need to con-\nsider an asserted environmental consequence of a pro-\nposed federal action unless it is \u201creasonably foreseea-\nble.\u201d  See Pet. Br. 2; Envtl. Resp. Br. 10; Cnty. Resp. \n\n4 \n \nBr. 22-23.  Congress codified that requirement in its \n2023 amendments to NEPA.  42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C)(i) \n(specifying that an agency must examine the \u201creasona-\nbly foreseeable environmental effects of the proposed \nagency action\u201d).  And although the environmental impact \nstatement in this case was completed before those 2023 \namendments were enacted, the regulations of the Coun-\ncil on Environmental Quality (CEQ) have long provided \nthat agencies should consider the \u201creasonably foresee-\nable\u201d environmental effects of their proposed actions.  \n43 Fed. Reg. 55,978, 56,004 (Nov. 29, 1978); 40 C.F.R. \n1508.8(b) (2019); 40 C.F.R. 1508.1(g) and (aa) (2021); 40 \nC.F.R. 1508.1(g) (2023); 40 C.F.R. 1508.1(i) (2024).1   \nMoreover, this Court has held that the statutory \nterm \u201cenvironmental effects\u201d embodies a further limi-\ntation on the scope of the environmental consequences \nan agency must analyze.  In Metropolitan Edison, the \nCourt explained that NEPA requires more than mere \n \n1 In a divided decision, the D.C. Circuit recently concluded that \nCEQ does not have statutory authority to issue regulations imple-\nmenting NEPA\u2019s procedural requirements that are binding on fed-\neral agencies and enforceable by the courts.  Marin Audubon Soc\u2019y \nv. FAA, No. 23-1067, 2024 WL 4745044 (Nov. 12, 2024).  The govern-\nment is currently assessing that ruling, which was issued without \nthe benefit of party briefing, as the dissent explained in maintaining \nthat the panel should not have decided the issue.  CEQ began issuing \nNEPA regulations through notice and comment in 1978, see 43 Fed. \nReg. at 55,978, and in the over four decades since, this Court has \nfrequently cited and relied on CEQ\u2019s regulations, e.g., Public Citizen, \n541 U.S. at 770; Marsh v. Oregon Natural Res. Council, 490 U.S. 360, \n372 (1989); Andrus v. Sierra Club, 442 U.S. 347, 356 (1979).  What-\never the merits of the D.C. Circuit\u2019s recent decision, CEQ\u2019s regula-\ntions represent the considered judgment of the expert body estab-\nlished by NEPA concerning the appropriate implementation of \nNEPA\u2019s general requirements.  And they also reflect the basic con-\ntours of agency practice under NEPA going back more than 45 years.   \n\n5 \n \n\u201cbut for\u201d causation because the term \u201cenvironmental ef-\nfect\u201d must \u201cbe read to include a requirement of a rea-\nsonably close causal relationship between a change in \nthe physical environment and the effect at issue.\u201d  460 \nU.S. at 774.  Then, in Public Citizen, the Court ex-\nplained that an agency action is not the \u201clegally relevant \ncause\u201d of an environmental harm the agency lacks the \npower to prevent.  541 U.S. at 769.  And more generally, \nPublic Citizen held that agencies are permitted to draw \n\u201cmanageable\u201d lines to identify the consequences that \nhave a sufficiently close causal connection to the pro-\nposed action to warrant consideration, informed by the \n\u201c\u200a\u2018rule of reason\u2019\u200a\u201d inherent in NEPA and the \u201cstatutory \npurposes\u201d of an environmental impact statement.

Those purposes are primar-\nily (1) \u201c\u200a\u2018ensur[ing] that the agency, in reaching its deci-\nsion, will have available, and will carefully consider, de-\ntailed information concerning significant environmental \nimpacts,\u2019\u200a\u201d and (2) providing relevant information to the \npublic that serves as a \u201c\u200a\u2018springboard for public com-\nment\u2019 in the agency decisionmaking process itself.\u201d  Id. \nat 768 (citation omitted).   \nUnder these principles, an agency may exclude or \nminimize consideration of environmental harms based \non its determination that, in light of the scope of the \nproposed federal action and the nature of the agency\u2019s \norganic statutes, the harms are too attenuated, specu-\nlative, contingent, or otherwise insufficiently material \nto be \u201cuseful[]\u201d to the agency\u2019s decisionmaking process.  \nPublic Citizen, 541 U.S. at 767-768; see Gov\u2019t Br. 21-22, \n27-28.  Courts may not set aside such a determination \nunless it is arbitrary or capricious.  Kleppe, 427 U.S. at \n412.   \n\n6 \n \nB. The Non-Federal Respondents Err In Asserting That \nReasonable Foreseeability Is The Only Limit On The \nScope Of An Environmental Impact Statement \nThe non-federal respondents agree (e.g., Envtl. \nResp. Br. 44) with the basic principle that an agency \nneed not consider \u201ceffects that are too attenuated, spec-\nulative, contingent, or otherwise insufficiently material \nto the environmental review that NEPA requires.\u201d  But \nthey err in suggesting that those considerations are \nfully accounted for by the reasonable foreseeability re-\nquirement.  This Court has repeatedly recognized that \nreasonable foreseeability is not the only limit on an \nagency\u2019s NEPA obligations because those obligations \nare triggered only by a \u201creasonably close causal rela-\ntionship\u201d between the proposed agency action and the \nasserted effect, Metropolitan Edison, 460 U.S. at 774, \nand the extent of the analysis required of the agency is \nsubject to the \u201crule of reason\u201d inherent in NEPA, Pub-\nlic Citizen, 541 U.S. at 767-768.   \n1. \u201cReasonable foreseeability\u201d is one key limit on the \nscope of a NEPA analysis.  Current CEQ regulations, \nwhich were in place in 2023 when Congress codified the \n\u201creasonable foreseeability\u201d requirement in NEPA, define \n\u201c[r]easonably foreseeable\u201d as \u201csufficiently likely to oc-\ncur such that a person of ordinary prudence would take \nit into account in reaching a decision.\u201d  85 Fed. Reg. \n43,304, 43,376 (July 16, 2020) (40 C.F.R. 1508.1(aa) \n(2021)) (emphasis omitted); see 40 C.F.R. 1508.1(ii) \n(2024) (same).  That definition, which accords with the \nplain meaning of the phrase, places the emphasis on \nwhat effects an agency should reasonably anticipate.  It \ntherefore permits agencies to exclude effects that are \ntoo contingent, removed, or uncertain to warrant con-\nsideration.   \n\n7 \n \nBut this Court\u2019s precedents make clear that agencies \nmay impose limits on their NEPA analyses beyond \nthose captured by the term \u201creasonably foreseeable.\u201d  \nMetropolitan Edison explained that the statutory term \n\u201c\u200a\u2018environmental effect\u2019\u200a\u201d further requires a \u201creasonably \nclose causal relationship.\u201d  460 U.S. at 774.  And in Pub-\nlic Citizen, the Court recognized that, even when an en-\nvironmental harm is \u201creasonably foreseeable,\u201d 541 U.S. \nat 766 (citation omitted), NEPA\u2019s causation standard \nmay not be met, id. at 767-768.  That is because the cau-\nsation standard looks not only to factual foreseeability, \nbut also to the scope of the agency\u2019s action and the use-\nfulness of particular environmental analysis, informed \nby the agency\u2019s statutory authority, and NEPA\u2019s \u201cun-\nderlying policies\u201d and \u201c\u200a\u2018rule of reason.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Id. at 768.   \nWhile there is undoubtedly overlap between the re-\nquirements of reasonable foreseeability and the causa-\ntion standards under NEPA, see Gov\u2019t Br. 23-24, the \nnon-federal respondents wrongly assume that the over-\nlap is complete.  They therefore assert (e.g., Envtl. \nResp. Br. 1) that NEPA requires an agency to consider \nevery environmental harm for which the agency\u2019s action \nis the but-for cause, so long as the harm is \u201csufficiently \nlikely to occur and capable of being considered in suffi-\ncient detail.\u201d  That test would impose a rigidly expan-\nsive obligation on federal agencies, depriving them of \nthe ability to make a reasonable determination regard-\ning whether and to what extent the analysis of a harm \nwill be useful to the decisionmaking process.  And the \nnon-federal respondents\u2019 test would also be inconsistent \nwith Metropolitan Edison and Public Citizen, which \nemphasized that agencies are permitted to draw a \u201cman-\nageable\u201d line between environmental consequences that \nhave a reasonably close causal relationship with the pro-\n\n8 \n \nposed federal action and those that do not, based on \nNEPA\u2019s underlying policies and the rule of reason.   \n2. The non-federal respondents mistakenly suggest \nthat Congress\u2019s 2023 NEPA amendments confirm that \nreasonable foreseeability is the only permissible limit \non an agency\u2019s NEPA analysis.  Metropolitan Edison \nand Public Citizen explained that the requirement of a \n\u201creasonably close causal relationship\u201d is contained in \nthe statutory term \u201c\u200a\u2018environmental effect.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Metropol-\nitan Edison, 460 U.S. at 774.  That term remains in the \nstatute after the 2023 amendments, and none of Con-\ngress\u2019s other changes suggest an intent to depart from \nthe Court\u2019s prior construction.   \nIndeed, it would be more than passing strange to \nread the 2023 NEPA amendments to broaden the range \nof harms an agency must consider beyond what this \nCourt\u2019s prior precedents established, because several of \nthose amendments were aimed at lessening the burden \non federal agencies.  Thus, the amendments contain pro-\nvisions for shortening both the length of environmental \nimpact statements, 42 U.S.C. 4336a(e), and the time de-\nvoted to the environmental review process, 42 U.S.C. \n4336a(g).  It is hard to imagine, for example, how an \nagency could fit a detailed analysis of every reasonably \nforeseeable environmental harm that might flow from a \nmajor federal action into the 150 pages the amendments \ncontemplate, 42 U.S.C. 4336a(e), when the environmen-\ntal impact statement respondents found lacking here \nwas almost 600 pages and had approximately 3000 \npages of appendices.   \n3. The non-federal respondents also err in asserting \n(e.g., Envtl. Resp. Br. 46) that allowing agencies to draw \nmanageable lines leads to \u201cunbounded and unpredicta-\nble results.\u201d  An agency generally cannot disregard a \n\n9 \n \nreasonably foreseeable environmental effect where \nthere is a \u201creasonably close causal relationship\u201d be-\ntween the effect and the proposed agency action.  That \nstandard is flexible, not boundless.  It permits an agency \nto exclude or minimize the analysis of effects where the \nagency reasonably finds that the requisite causal rela-\ntionship is absent or diminished.  And an agency may \nmake that finding based on a range of context-specific \nfactors, including the scope of the proposed action, the \nnature and reach of the agency\u2019s organic statutes, and \nwhether the asserted harm is too attenuated, specula-\ntive, contingent, or otherwise insufficiently material to \nthe particular agency decision.  Public Citizen, 541 U.S. \nat 767.  The fact that other governmental entities au-\nthorize, fund, or carry out the specific conduct that \ngives rise to the environmental issues may also inform \nan agency\u2019s determination that the requisite \u201creasona-\nbly close causal relationship\u201d between its own actions \nand particular harms is missing or less robust.  Ibid. (ci-\ntation omitted); see Gov\u2019t Br. 17-18.  But an agency may \nnot exclude analysis of a reasonably foreseeable effect \nif those same considerations establish the agency action \nis the \u201clegally relevant cause\u201d of the effect and consid-\nering the effect is necessary to accomplish NEPA\u2019s \u201cun-\nderlying policies\u201d and is consistent with its \u201c\u200a\u2018rule of rea-\nson.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Public Citizen, 541 U.S. at 768-769.   \n4. The non-federal respondents are also wrong to \ncontend (e.g., Envtl. Resp. Br. 46) that the government\u2019s \nposition represents a \u201cchange[]\u201d from \u201cthe longstand-\ning, well-understood framework for environmental re-\nview under NEPA.\u201d  As Metropolitan Edison and Pub-\nlic Citizen make clear, NEPA has always included room \nfor agencies to draw \u201c\u200a\u2018manageable,\u2019\u200a\u201d context-specific \nlines based on the extent to which the analysis of envi-\n\n10 \n \nronmental harms will be \u201cuseful[]\u201d to the decisionmak-\ning process.  Public Citizen, 541 U.S. at 767 (citation \nomitted).   \nFurther, for over four decades, CEQ has emphasized \nthat agencies should \u201cfocus[] on the major issues and \nreal choices facing federal decisionmakers and ex-\nclud[e] less important matters from detailed study.\u201d  43 \nFed. Reg. at 55,983.  In promulgating the 1978 NEPA \nregulations, CEQ explained that such line drawing is \ncrucial because \u201c[t]he usefulness of the NEPA process \nto decisionmakers and the public ha[d] been jeopard-\nized in recent years by the length and complexity of en-\nvironmental impact statements.\u201d  Ibid.  And in promul-\ngating regulatory amendments in 1986, CEQ reiterated \nthat an agency\u2019s evaluation of \u201creasonably foreseeable \nsignificant adverse effects\u201d should be informed by the \n\u201crule of reason.\u201d  51 Fed. Reg. 15,618, 15,621, 15,625-\n15,626 (Apr. 25, 1986).  CEQ explained that the \u201c\u200a\u2018rule of \nreason\u2019 is basically a judicial device to ensure that com-\nmon sense and reason are not lost,\u201d and that agencies \nare not forced to \u201c\u200a\u2018discuss remote and highly specula-\ntive consequences\u2019\u200a\u201d that will not be useful to the deci-\nsionmaking process.  Ibid. (citation omitted).   \nCurrent CEQ regulations carry forward the long-\nstanding position that agencies should draw managea-\nble lines that focus an agency\u2019s resources and attention \non the issues that are most significant to the deci-\nsionmaking process.  The regulations call for agencies \nto undertake a \u201cscoping\u201d process at the outset of an en-\nvironmental review during which they \u201cidentify[] the \nimportant issues and eliminat[e] from further study un-\nimportant issues,\u201d 40 C.F.R. 1502.4(a), as well as issues \nthat \u201chave been covered by prior environmental re-\nview(s),\u201d 40 C.F.R. 1502.4(d)(1).  The regulations also \n\n11 \n \nprovide that \u201c[e]nvironmental impact statements shall \ndiscuss effects in proportion to their significance,\u201d with \n\u201conly brief discussion of other than important issues.\u201d  \n40 C.F.R. 1502.2(b); see 40 C.F.R. 1500.2, 1500.4, \n1501.1(d).   \nIn addition, this Court\u2019s precedents have long em-\nphasized that judicial review of an agency\u2019s final deci-\nsion under the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. \n701 et seq.\u2014including review of an agency\u2019s decisions \nregarding the scope and content of its accompanying \nenvironmental impact statement\u2014is highly deferential \nand may be set aside only if arbitrary and capricious.  In \nMarsh v. Oregon Natural Resources Council, 490 U.S. \n360 (1989), for example, this Court recognized that \u201can \nagency must have discretion to rely on the reasonable \nopinions of its own qualified experts even if, as an orig-\ninal matter, a court might find contrary views more per-\nsuasive.\u201d  Id. at 378.   \nC. Petitioners Err To The Extent They Endorse Bright-\nLine Rules That Find No Footing In NEPA\u2019s Text \nPetitioners and the federal respondents are in ac-\ncord on the basic principles governing the requirements \nof NEPA, all of which support the sufficiency of the \nBoard\u2019s NEPA analysis that is before the Court in this \ncase.  See pp. 19-22, infra.  Like the federal respond-\nents, petitioners argue (Br. 21) that the review required \nby NEPA encompasses only the \u201creasonably foreseea-\nble effects of\u200a\u201d a proposed action.  They further argue \n(Br. 17) that, in determining what qualifies as an \u201cef-\nfect[]\u201d of a project, NEPA does not apply a but-for \nstandard of causation, and instead looks to whether the \nproposed agency action is the \u201clegally relevant\u201d cause \nof the environmental harm.  Petitioners also emphasize \nthat agencies must be permitted to draw \u201cmanageable\u201d \n\n12 \n \nlines that accomplish NEPA\u2019s \u201cgoal of \u2018ensur[ing] a \nfully informed and well considered [agency] decision\u2019\u200a\u201d \nwithout requiring analysis of matters that are insuffi-\nciently material.  Br. 42 (citation omitted; first set of \nbrackets in original).  And, like federal respondents, pe-\ntitioners observe that, in drawing those lines, agencies \nmay look to the limits of their statutory \u201cremit,\u201d Br. 26, \nand the \u201cattenuated,\u201d Br. 33 (citation omitted), \u201cspecu-\nlative,\u201d and \u201ccontingent\u201d nature of the alleged environ-\nmental harms, Br. 36.  \nAt times, however, petitioners appear to go further, \nsuggesting that an agency may apply bright-line rules \nto exclude analysis of reasonably foreseeable environ-\nmental effects for which the agency is the legally rele-\nvant cause, even though that analysis would be useful to \nthe agency\u2019s decisionmaking and would aid the public in \nproviding informed comments during the decisionmak-\ning process.  Neither NEPA\u2019s text nor this Court\u2019s prec-\nedents support imposition of those limits. \n1. Petitioners suggest (e.g., Br. 30-31) that agencies \nshould apply the same proximate cause standard that \napplies in tort suits.  But this Court has already rejected \nthe contention that \u201cany cause-effect relation too atten-\nuated to merit damages in a tort suit would also be too \nattenuated to merit notice in an\u201d environmental impact \nstatement.

L. No. 91-190, 83 Stat. 852 (42 \nU.S.C. 4321 et seq.), and this Court\u2019s precedents estab-\nlish several basic principles regarding the appropriate \ncontours of an environmental impact statement.  First, \nan agency must analyze the \u201creasonably foreseeable en-\nvironmental effects of the proposed agency action.\u201d  42 \nU.S.C. 4332(2)(C)(i).  Second, the term \u201c\u200a\u2018environmental \neffect\u2019  * * *  include[s] a requirement of a reasonably \nclose causal relationship\u201d between the agency action \nand the particular environmental harm.  Metropolitan \nEdison Co. v. People Against Nuclear Energy, 460 U.S. \n766, 774 (1983).  An agency may therefore draw \u201cman-\nageable\u201d lines concerning causation that look to \u201cthe un-\nderlying policies behind NEPA and Congress\u2019 intent, as \n\n2 \n \ninformed by the \u2018rule of reason.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Department of \nTransp. v. Public Citizen, 541 U.S. 752, 767 (2004) (ci-\ntation omitted).  Third, when an agency makes a deter-\nmination under this framework about the scope of its \nenvironmental impact statement, a reviewing court \n\u201cmust assume\u201d that the agency has \u201cexercised [its] dis-\ncretion appropriately\u201d \u201c[a]bsent a showing of arbitrary \naction.\u201d  Kleppe v. Sierra Club, 427 U.S. 390, 412 (1976).   \nThe non-federal respondents nonetheless contend \nthat an agency must consider every environmental con-\nsequence that is reasonably foreseeable as a factual \nmatter.  That contention is incorrect.  This Court\u2019s prec-\nedents make clear that NEPA permits agencies to limit \ntheir environmental analyses based on whether and to \nwhat extent the proposed federal action is the \u201clegally \nrelevant cause\u201d of the effects.  Public Citizen, 541 U.S. \nat 769.  An agency may therefore make a reasonable, \ncontext-specific determination that\u2014based on the scope \nof the proposed action and the provisions of the agency\u2019s \ngoverning statutes\u2014a harm is too attenuated, specula-\ntive, contingent, or otherwise insufficiently material to \nwarrant additional consideration, or any consideration \nat all, in an environmental impact statement. \nAt the same time, petitioners go too far to the extent \nthey ask this Court to impose the same standard of \nproximate cause that applies in tort suits.  The common \nlaw of torts is distinct from the statutory requirements \nin NEPA and serves different purposes.  Agencies can-\nnot woodenly apply tort standards\u2014or the other cate-\ngorical limits petitioners sometimes appear to advocate \n\u2014where doing so would produce a result that contra-\nvenes NEPA\u2019s underlying policies and its rule of rea-\nson.   \n\n3 \n \nThe Surface Transportation Board (Board) properly \napplied those principles in this case.  The Board made a \nreasonable, context-specific determination that it did \nnot need to provide additional analysis of the upstream \nand downstream effects of oil and gas development and \nrefining in its environmental impact statement.  Accord-\ningly, the court of appeals erred in vacating that portion \nof the Board\u2019s decision.  This Court should so hold and \nremand to the court of appeals.  The Court should de-\ncline petitioners\u2019 request to reach beyond the question \npresented to consider aspects of the court of appeals\u2019 \ndecision that were not challenged in the petition for a \nwrit of certiorari.   \nA. NEPA Permits Agencies To Draw Manageable, Context-\nSpecific Lines In Determining The Scope Of Their  \nEnvironmental Impact Statements \nNEPA\u2019s text requires a federal agency to produce a \n\u201cdetailed statement\u201d examining the environmental ef-\nfects of a proposal for a \u201cmajor Federal action[] signifi-\ncantly affecting the quality of the human environment.\u201d \n42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C).  As the government explained in \nits opening brief (at 19-20), that procedural require-\nment is the primary means through which Congress vin-\ndicated its express intent to develop a \u201cnational envi-\nronmental policy,\u201d under which all federal agencies \nwork to \u201cprevent or eliminate damage to the environ-\nment\u201d and improve public health and welfare, while also \nenhancing understanding of the environment.  42 U.S.C. \n4321, 4331 (emphasis omitted).  But NEPA\u2019s core pro-\ncedural requirement has important limits.   \nAs all parties agree, an agency does not need to con-\nsider an asserted environmental consequence of a pro-\nposed federal action unless it is \u201creasonably foreseea-\nble.\u201d  See Pet. Br. 2; Envtl. Resp. Br. 10; Cnty. Resp. \n\n4 \n \nBr. 22-23.  Congress codified that requirement in its \n2023 amendments to NEPA.  42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C)(i) \n(specifying that an agency must examine the \u201creasona-\nbly foreseeable environmental effects of the proposed \nagency action\u201d).  And although the environmental impact \nstatement in this case was completed before those 2023 \namendments were enacted, the regulations of the Coun-\ncil on Environmental Quality (CEQ) have long provided \nthat agencies should consider the \u201creasonably foresee-\nable\u201d environmental effects of their proposed actions.  \n43 Fed. Reg. 55,978, 56,004 (Nov. 29, 1978); 40 C.F.R. \n1508.8(b) (2019); 40 C.F.R. 1508.1(g) and (aa) (2021); 40 \nC.F.R. 1508.1(g) (2023); 40 C.F.R. 1508.1(i) (2024).1   \nMoreover, this Court has held that the statutory \nterm \u201cenvironmental effects\u201d embodies a further limi-\ntation on the scope of the environmental consequences \nan agency must analyze.  In Metropolitan Edison, the \nCourt explained that NEPA requires more than mere \n \n1 In a divided decision, the D.C. Circuit recently concluded that \nCEQ does not have statutory authority to issue regulations imple-\nmenting NEPA\u2019s procedural requirements that are binding on fed-\neral agencies and enforceable by the courts.  Marin Audubon Soc\u2019y \nv. FAA, No. 23-1067, 2024 WL 4745044 (Nov. 12, 2024).  The govern-\nment is currently assessing that ruling, which was issued without \nthe benefit of party briefing, as the dissent explained in maintaining \nthat the panel should not have decided the issue.  CEQ began issuing \nNEPA regulations through notice and comment in 1978, see 43 Fed. \nReg. at 55,978, and in the over four decades since, this Court has \nfrequently cited and relied on CEQ\u2019s regulations, e.g., Public Citizen, \n541 U.S. at 770; Marsh v. Oregon Natural Res. Council, 490 U.S. 360, \n372 (1989); Andrus v. Sierra Club, 442 U.S. 347, 356 (1979).  What-\never the merits of the D.C. Circuit\u2019s recent decision, CEQ\u2019s regula-\ntions represent the considered judgment of the expert body estab-\nlished by NEPA concerning the appropriate implementation of \nNEPA\u2019s general requirements.  And they also reflect the basic con-\ntours of agency practice under NEPA going back more than 45 years.   \n\n5 \n \n\u201cbut for\u201d causation because the term \u201cenvironmental ef-\nfect\u201d must \u201cbe read to include a requirement of a rea-\nsonably close causal relationship between a change in \nthe physical environment and the effect at issue.\u201d  460 \nU.S. at 774.  Then, in Public Citizen, the Court ex-\nplained that an agency action is not the \u201clegally relevant \ncause\u201d of an environmental harm the agency lacks the \npower to prevent.  541 U.S. at 769.  And more generally, \nPublic Citizen held that agencies are permitted to draw \n\u201cmanageable\u201d lines to identify the consequences that \nhave a sufficiently close causal connection to the pro-\nposed action to warrant consideration, informed by the \n\u201c\u200a\u2018rule of reason\u2019\u200a\u201d inherent in NEPA and the \u201cstatutory \npurposes\u201d of an environmental impact statement.  Id. at \n767-768 (citation omitted).  Those purposes are primar-\nily (1) \u201c\u200a\u2018ensur[ing] that the agency, in reaching its deci-\nsion, will have available, and will carefully consider, de-\ntailed information concerning significant environmental \nimpacts,\u2019\u200a\u201d and (2) providing relevant information to the \npublic that serves as a \u201c\u200a\u2018springboard for public com-\nment\u2019 in the agency decisionmaking process itself.\u201d  Id. \nat 768 (citation omitted).   \nUnder these principles, an agency may exclude or \nminimize consideration of environmental harms based \non its determination that, in light of the scope of the \nproposed federal action and the nature of the agency\u2019s \norganic statutes, the harms are too attenuated, specu-\nlative, contingent, or otherwise insufficiently material \nto be \u201cuseful[]\u201d to the agency\u2019s decisionmaking process.  \nPublic Citizen, 541 U.S. at 767-768; see Gov\u2019t Br. 21-22, \n27-28.  Courts may not set aside such a determination \nunless it is arbitrary or capricious.  Kleppe, 427 U.S. at \n412.   \n\n6 \n \nB. The Non-Federal Respondents Err In Asserting That \nReasonable Foreseeability Is The Only Limit On The \nScope Of An Environmental Impact Statement \nThe non-federal respondents agree (e.g., Envtl. \nResp. Br. 44) with the basic principle that an agency \nneed not consider \u201ceffects that are too attenuated, spec-\nulative, contingent, or otherwise insufficiently material \nto the environmental review that NEPA requires.\u201d  But \nthey err in suggesting that those considerations are \nfully accounted for by the reasonable foreseeability re-\nquirement.  This Court has repeatedly recognized that \nreasonable foreseeability is not the only limit on an \nagency\u2019s NEPA obligations because those obligations \nare triggered only by a \u201creasonably close causal rela-\ntionship\u201d between the proposed agency action and the \nasserted effect, Metropolitan Edison, 460 U.S. at 774, \nand the extent of the analysis required of the agency is \nsubject to the \u201crule of reason\u201d inherent in NEPA, Pub-\nlic Citizen, 541 U.S. at 767-768.   \n1. \u201cReasonable foreseeability\u201d is one key limit on the \nscope of a NEPA analysis.  Current CEQ regulations, \nwhich were in place in 2023 when Congress codified the \n\u201creasonable foreseeability\u201d requirement in NEPA, define \n\u201c[r]easonably foreseeable\u201d as \u201csufficiently likely to oc-\ncur such that a person of ordinary prudence would take \nit into account in reaching a decision.\u201d  85 Fed. Reg. \n43,304, 43,376 (July 16, 2020) (40 C.F.R. 1508.1(aa) \n(2021)) (emphasis omitted); see 40 C.F.R. 1508.1(ii) \n(2024) (same).  That definition, which accords with the \nplain meaning of the phrase, places the emphasis on \nwhat effects an agency should reasonably anticipate.  It \ntherefore permits agencies to exclude effects that are \ntoo contingent, removed, or uncertain to warrant con-\nsideration.   \n\n7 \n \nBut this Court\u2019s precedents make clear that agencies \nmay impose limits on their NEPA analyses beyond \nthose captured by the term \u201creasonably foreseeable.\u201d  \nMetropolitan Edison explained that the statutory term \n\u201c\u200a\u2018environmental effect\u2019\u200a\u201d further requires a \u201creasonably \nclose causal relationship.\u201d  460 U.S. at 774.  And in Pub-\nlic Citizen, the Court recognized that, even when an en-\nvironmental harm is \u201creasonably foreseeable,\u201d 541 U.S. \nat 766 (citation omitted), NEPA\u2019s causation standard \nmay not be met, id. at 767-768.  That is because the cau-\nsation standard looks not only to factual foreseeability, \nbut also to the scope of the agency\u2019s action and the use-\nfulness of particular environmental analysis, informed \nby the agency\u2019s statutory authority, and NEPA\u2019s \u201cun-\nderlying policies\u201d and \u201c\u200a\u2018rule of reason.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Id. at 768.   \nWhile there is undoubtedly overlap between the re-\nquirements of reasonable foreseeability and the causa-\ntion standards under NEPA, see Gov\u2019t Br. 23-24, the \nnon-federal respondents wrongly assume that the over-\nlap is complete.  They therefore assert (e.g., Envtl. \nResp. Br. 1) that NEPA requires an agency to consider \nevery environmental harm for which the agency\u2019s action \nis the but-for cause, so long as the harm is \u201csufficiently \nlikely to occur and capable of being considered in suffi-\ncient detail.\u201d  That test would impose a rigidly expan-\nsive obligation on federal agencies, depriving them of \nthe ability to make a reasonable determination regard-\ning whether and to what extent the analysis of a harm \nwill be useful to the decisionmaking process.  And the \nnon-federal respondents\u2019 test would also be inconsistent \nwith Metropolitan Edison and Public Citizen, which \nemphasized that agencies are permitted to draw a \u201cman-\nageable\u201d line between environmental consequences that \nhave a reasonably close causal relationship with the pro-\n\n8 \n \nposed federal action and those that do not, based on \nNEPA\u2019s underlying policies and the rule of reason.   \n2. The non-federal respondents mistakenly suggest \nthat Congress\u2019s 2023 NEPA amendments confirm that \nreasonable foreseeability is the only permissible limit \non an agency\u2019s NEPA analysis.  Metropolitan Edison \nand Public Citizen explained that the requirement of a \n\u201creasonably close causal relationship\u201d is contained in \nthe statutory term \u201c\u200a\u2018environmental effect.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Metropol-\nitan Edison, 460 U.S. at 774.  That term remains in the \nstatute after the 2023 amendments, and none of Con-\ngress\u2019s other changes suggest an intent to depart from \nthe Court\u2019s prior construction.   \nIndeed, it would be more than passing strange to \nread the 2023 NEPA amendments to broaden the range \nof harms an agency must consider beyond what this \nCourt\u2019s prior precedents established, because several of \nthose amendments were aimed at lessening the burden \non federal agencies.  Thus, the amendments contain pro-\nvisions for shortening both the length of environmental \nimpact statements, 42 U.S.C. 4336a(e), and the time de-\nvoted to the environmental review process, 42 U.S.C. \n4336a(g).  It is hard to imagine, for example, how an \nagency could fit a detailed analysis of every reasonably \nforeseeable environmental harm that might flow from a \nmajor federal action into the 150 pages the amendments \ncontemplate, 42 U.S.C. 4336a(e), when the environmen-\ntal impact statement respondents found lacking here \nwas almost 600 pages and had approximately 3000 \npages of appendices.   \n3. The non-federal respondents also err in asserting \n(e.g., Envtl. Resp. Br. 46) that allowing agencies to draw \nmanageable lines leads to \u201cunbounded and unpredicta-\nble results.\u201d  An agency generally cannot disregard a \n\n9 \n \nreasonably foreseeable environmental effect where \nthere is a \u201creasonably close causal relationship\u201d be-\ntween the effect and the proposed agency action.  That \nstandard is flexible, not boundless.  It permits an agency \nto exclude or minimize the analysis of effects where the \nagency reasonably finds that the requisite causal rela-\ntionship is absent or diminished.  And an agency may \nmake that finding based on a range of context-specific \nfactors, including the scope of the proposed action, the \nnature and reach of the agency\u2019s organic statutes, and \nwhether the asserted harm is too attenuated, specula-\ntive, contingent, or otherwise insufficiently material to \nthe particular agency decision.  Public Citizen, 541 U.S. \nat 767.  The fact that other governmental entities au-\nthorize, fund, or carry out the specific conduct that \ngives rise to the environmental issues may also inform \nan agency\u2019s determination that the requisite \u201creasona-\nbly close causal relationship\u201d between its own actions \nand particular harms is missing or less robust.  Ibid. (ci-\ntation omitted); see Gov\u2019t Br. 17-18.  But an agency may \nnot exclude analysis of a reasonably foreseeable effect \nif those same considerations establish the agency action \nis the \u201clegally relevant cause\u201d of the effect and consid-\nering the effect is necessary to accomplish NEPA\u2019s \u201cun-\nderlying policies\u201d and is consistent with its \u201c\u200a\u2018rule of rea-\nson.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Public Citizen, 541 U.S. at 768-769.   \n4. The non-federal respondents are also wrong to \ncontend (e.g., Envtl. Resp. Br. 46) that the government\u2019s \nposition represents a \u201cchange[]\u201d from \u201cthe longstand-\ning, well-understood framework for environmental re-\nview under NEPA.\u201d  As Metropolitan Edison and Pub-\nlic Citizen make clear, NEPA has always included room \nfor agencies to draw \u201c\u200a\u2018manageable,\u2019\u200a\u201d context-specific \nlines based on the extent to which the analysis of envi-\n\n10 \n \nronmental harms will be \u201cuseful[]\u201d to the decisionmak-\ning process.  Public Citizen, 541 U.S. at 767 (citation \nomitted).   \nFurther, for over four decades, CEQ has emphasized \nthat agencies should \u201cfocus[] on the major issues and \nreal choices facing federal decisionmakers and ex-\nclud[e] less important matters from detailed study.\u201d  43 \nFed. Reg. at 55,983.  In promulgating the 1978 NEPA \nregulations, CEQ explained that such line drawing is \ncrucial because \u201c[t]he usefulness of the NEPA process \nto decisionmakers and the public ha[d] been jeopard-\nized in recent years by the length and complexity of en-\nvironmental impact statements.\u201d  Ibid.  And in promul-\ngating regulatory amendments in 1986, CEQ reiterated \nthat an agency\u2019s evaluation of \u201creasonably foreseeable \nsignificant adverse effects\u201d should be informed by the \n\u201crule of reason.\u201d  51 Fed. Reg. 15,618, 15,621, 15,625-\n15,626 (Apr. 25, 1986).  CEQ explained that the \u201c\u200a\u2018rule of \nreason\u2019 is basically a judicial device to ensure that com-\nmon sense and reason are not lost,\u201d and that agencies \nare not forced to \u201c\u200a\u2018discuss remote and highly specula-\ntive consequences\u2019\u200a\u201d that will not be useful to the deci-\nsionmaking process.  Ibid. (citation omitted).   \nCurrent CEQ regulations carry forward the long-\nstanding position that agencies should draw managea-\nble lines that focus an agency\u2019s resources and attention \non the issues that are most significant to the deci-\nsionmaking process.  The regulations call for agencies \nto undertake a \u201cscoping\u201d process at the outset of an en-\nvironmental review during which they \u201cidentify[] the \nimportant issues and eliminat[e] from further study un-\nimportant issues,\u201d 40 C.F.R. 1502.4(a), as well as issues \nthat \u201chave been covered by prior environmental re-\nview(s),\u201d 40 C.F.R. 1502.4(d)(1).  The regulations also \n\n11 \n \nprovide that \u201c[e]nvironmental impact statements shall \ndiscuss effects in proportion to their significance,\u201d with \n\u201conly brief discussion of other than important issues.\u201d  \n40 C.F.R. 1502.2(b); see 40 C.F.R. 1500.2, 1500.4, \n1501.1(d).   \nIn addition, this Court\u2019s precedents have long em-\nphasized that judicial review of an agency\u2019s final deci-\nsion under the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. \n701 et seq.\u2014including review of an agency\u2019s decisions \nregarding the scope and content of its accompanying \nenvironmental impact statement\u2014is highly deferential \nand may be set aside only if arbitrary and capricious.  In \nMarsh v. Oregon Natural Resources Council, 490 U.S. \n360 (1989), for example, this Court recognized that \u201can \nagency must have discretion to rely on the reasonable \nopinions of its own qualified experts even if, as an orig-\ninal matter, a court might find contrary views more per-\nsuasive.\u201d  Id. at 378.   \nC. Petitioners Err To The Extent They Endorse Bright-\nLine Rules That Find No Footing In NEPA\u2019s Text \nPetitioners and the federal respondents are in ac-\ncord on the basic principles governing the requirements \nof NEPA, all of which support the sufficiency of the \nBoard\u2019s NEPA analysis that is before the Court in this \ncase.  See pp. 19-22, infra.  Like the federal respond-\nents, petitioners argue (Br. 21) that the review required \nby NEPA encompasses only the \u201creasonably foreseea-\nble effects of\u200a\u201d a proposed action.  They further argue \n(Br. 17) that, in determining what qualifies as an \u201cef-\nfect[]\u201d of a project, NEPA does not apply a but-for \nstandard of causation, and instead looks to whether the \nproposed agency action is the \u201clegally relevant\u201d cause \nof the environmental harm.  Petitioners also emphasize \nthat agencies must be permitted to draw \u201cmanageable\u201d \n\n12 \n \nlines that accomplish NEPA\u2019s \u201cgoal of \u2018ensur[ing] a \nfully informed and well considered [agency] decision\u2019\u200a\u201d \nwithout requiring analysis of matters that are insuffi-\nciently material.  Br. 42 (citation omitted; first set of \nbrackets in original).  And, like federal respondents, pe-\ntitioners observe that, in drawing those lines, agencies \nmay look to the limits of their statutory \u201cremit,\u201d Br. 26, \nand the \u201cattenuated,\u201d Br. 33 (citation omitted), \u201cspecu-\nlative,\u201d and \u201ccontingent\u201d nature of the alleged environ-\nmental harms, Br. 36.  \nAt times, however, petitioners appear to go further, \nsuggesting that an agency may apply bright-line rules \nto exclude analysis of reasonably foreseeable environ-\nmental effects for which the agency is the legally rele-\nvant cause, even though that analysis would be useful to \nthe agency\u2019s decisionmaking and would aid the public in \nproviding informed comments during the decisionmak-\ning process.  Neither NEPA\u2019s text nor this Court\u2019s prec-\nedents support imposition of those limits. \n1. Petitioners suggest (e.g., Br. 30-31) that agencies \nshould apply the same proximate cause standard that \napplies in tort suits.  But this Court has already rejected \nthe contention that \u201cany cause-effect relation too atten-\nuated to merit damages in a tort suit would also be too \nattenuated to merit notice in an\u201d environmental impact \nstatement.  Metropolitan Edison, 460 U.S. at 774 n.7.  \nAs the government explained in its opening brief (at 34-\n37), tort law and NEPA serve different purposes.  Tort \nsuits assign monetary liability for a harm that has al-\nready occurred; NEPA is designed to implement a na-\ntional environmental policy by ensuring that agency de-\ncisionmaking is informed by the consideration of signif-\nicant environmental effects that are likely to occur in \nthe future.  Even when a connection between an agency \n\n13 \n \naction and an effect is not of a kind that might justify \nmonetary liability in a tort suit, the causal connection \nmay be close enough\u2014given the scope of the proposed \naction and the nature and reach of the agency\u2019s govern-\ning statutes\u2014that information about the harm will \nnonetheless make a material contribution to the agency\u2019s \ndecisionmaking process.  See Metropolitan Edison, 460 \nU.S. at 774 & n.7.  Conversely, there may be circum-\nstances in which tort law would impose liability but \nthere is not a sufficiently \u201cclose causal relationship\u201d for \npurposes of NEPA.  Ibid. \nFurther, as the environmental respondents explain \n(Br. 38-40), tort law has evolved, and some of the prin-\nciples that petitioners purport to draw from tort law are \noutdated or at least disputed.  Requiring agencies to di-\nvert their attention to parsing tort principles for which \nthey have no particular expertise would therefore be \nlikely to lead to more confusion and uncertainty for the \nagencies in preparing their environmental impact state-\nments, for project proponents seeking NEPA review, \nand for the courts charged with adjudicating any subse-\nquent challenges.  See Gov\u2019t Br. 36-37.  These additional \nburdens would run counter to Congress\u2019s goal in the \n2023 amendments of making the NEPA process more \nefficient. \nThis Court\u2019s decision in Robertson v. Methow Valley \nCitizens Council, 490 U.S. 332 (1989), illustrates the \ndelta between tort law and NEPA.  In Robertson, the \nForest Service prepared an environmental impact \nstatement in connection with its issuance of a special \nuse permit for a ski resort that would be built on federal \nland.  Id. at 336.  The effects the Forest Service ana-\nlyzed included both the immediate effects on air quality \nand animal populations that would arise from construct-\n\n14 \n \ning and operating the resort, and the \u201cadverse effects \non air quality and the mule deer herd\u201d in the surround-\ning area that were \u201cprimarily attributable to predicted \noff-site development\u201d spurred by the new resort.  Id. at \n350.  It is highly unlikely that the Forest Service (which, \nin any event, enjoys sovereign immunity) or even the \nnew ski resort could have been held liable in a tort suit \nbrought by a local resident harmed by the changes in \nair quality and mule deer population attributable to the \nnew development.  But the Court nonetheless cited the \nForest Service\u2019s consideration of those secondary ef-\nfects with approval, adding that their consideration en-\nsured that local authorities were given \u201cadequate notice \nof the expected consequences\u201d of the proposed federal \naction and a chance to plan their response.  Ibid.   \nPetitioners observe (Br. 24) that Robertson affirmed \nthe Forest Service\u2019s decision to issue its environmental \nimpact statement before the local authorities fully \u201cde-\nveloped\u201d a mitigation plan that identified specific mea-\nsures to address the changes in air quality and the mule \ndeer population that would result from the new devel-\nopment.  But the Court did not hold that the Forest Ser-\nvice was free to ignore the air quality and mule deer ef-\nfects altogether, as a strict analogy to tort law might \nsuggest.  Instead, the Court recognized that the need to \ndiscuss \u201cmitigation\u201d \u201cin sufficient detail to ensure that \nenvironmental consequences have been fairly evalu-\nated\u201d did not extend so far as to require the agency to \ndelay the release of its environmental impact statement \nuntil it received a final mitigation plan from local au-\nthorities to address off-site effects that were outside of \nthe agency\u2019s \u201cjurisdiction.\u201d  Robertson, 490 U.S. at 352.  \nRobertson therefore demonstrates that agencies may \ndraw manageable lines based on credible, available in-\n\n15 \n \nformation, the scope of the project, and the agency\u2019s or-\nganic statutes, not the wooden application of tort law. \n2. Petitioners similarly err in suggesting that the \n2023 NEPA amendments codified tort law standards of \nproximate cause by adding the term \u201creasonably fore-\nseeable.\u201d  Br. 27-28 (citation and emphasis omitted).  \nWhile \u201cforeseeability\u201d is typically an important compo-\nnent in a proximate cause analysis, it is not the sole com-\nponent.  This Court has explained that the proximate \ncause standard drawn from \u201c\u200a\u2018tort actions recognized at \ncommon law\u2019\u200a\u201d generally requires the application of \u201cdi-\nrectness principles\u201d of causation that typically limit \ndamages liability to harms within the \u201c\u200a\u2018first step.\u2019\u200a\u201d  \nBank of Am. Corp. v. City of Miami, 581 U.S. 189, 203 \n(2017) (citations omitted).  The 2023 NEPA amend-\nments codify the reasonable foreseeability standard, \nbut nothing in the amendments suggests that Congress \nalso intended to incorporate tort law\u2019s \u201c\u200a\u2018first step\u2019\u200a\u201d or \n\u201cdirectness principles.\u201d  Ibid. (citations omitted).  Nor \ndoes anything in the amendments suggest that Con-\ngress intended to depart from this Court\u2019s longstanding \nprecedents interpreting the term \u201cenvironmental ef-\nfect\u201d to incorporate the need for a reasonably close \ncausal connection, but not to adopt the same causation \nstandards as tort law.  See Metropolitan Edison, 460 \nU.S. at 774 & n.7. \nMoreover, imposing a strict \u201cdirectness\u201d or \u201cfirst \nstep\u201d limit on NEPA\u2019s requirements would mark a sub-\nstantial shift in the way the statute has traditionally \nbeen interpreted and applied.  As Robertson illustrates, \nagencies have long considered both the direct effects of \ntheir actions (in Robertson, the harms to air quality and \nlocal animals caused by the construction of the ski re-\nsort itself\u200a), and secondary effects (i.e., the harm to the \n\n16 \n \nair quality and mule deer population caused by the new \noff-site development the ski resort would trigger) that \nare both caused by the action and reasonably foreseea-\nble.  Indeed, the first NEPA regulations provided that \nagencies should consider not just the \u201cdirect\u201d environ-\nmental effects of the proposed agency action, but also \nreasonably foreseeable \u201cindirect\u201d effects.  40 C.F.R. \n1508.8(a) and (b) (1979).  And the regulations in place at \nthe time of Congress\u2019s 2023 amendments to NEPA (and \nstill in place now) similarly call for agencies to consider \nreasonably foreseeable direct, indirect, and cumulative \neffects of their actions.  40 C.F.R. 1508.1(g) (2022); 40 \nC.F.R. 1508.1(i). \n \n3. For similar reasons, petitioners err to the extent \nthey assert (Br. 40) that, under Metropolitan Edison, \nan agency may exclude the consideration of an environ-\nmental effect whenever it is mediated through \u201cnon- \nenvironmental effects\u201d on third parties.  See Pet. Br. 19-\n22.  Petitioners appear to suggest (ibid.), for example, \nthat an agency may disregard the environmental effects \nof new development spurred by a federal project be-\ncause that development is itself \u201cnon-environmental.\u201d  \nAgain, in Robertson, the Court recognized the propriety \nof the agency\u2019s consideration of environmental effects \ncaused by \u201cpredicted off-site development,\u201d rather than \nby the construction and operation of the ski resort itself.  \n490 U.S. at 350.  And agencies often consider environ-\nmental effects mediated through third parties when \nthey determine it is appropriate to do so based on the \ncontext, including the scope of the project and the na-\nture of the agency\u2019s organic statutes.  For example, be-\nfore the Federal Highway Administration funds a high-\nway project, it often considers the land use effects of the \n\n17 \n \nnew infrastructure, including reasonably foreseeable \ngrowth in nearby communities.2  \n \nPetitioners\u2019 proposed rule also rests on a misreading \nof Metropolitan Edison.  In that case, the Court held \nthat, in authorizing the reopening of a nuclear facility, \nthe Nuclear Regulatory Commission did not need to \nconsider the harms to the psychological health of nearby \nresidents that were caused by their fears concerning \nthe risk of a nuclear accident, because NEPA requires \nagencies to consider the public health consequences of \nchanges in the natural and physical environment, not \nthe health consequences of \u201crisk qua risk.\u201d  Metropoli-\ntan Edison, 460 U.S. at 779.  Metropolitan Edison\u2019s \nholding was therefore based on the Court\u2019s determina-\ntion that NEPA is focused on \u201cchange[s] in the physical \nenvironment\u201d and that the health harms flowing from \nfears or \u201crisk\u201d itself were \u201ctoo remote from the physical \nenvironment to justify\u201d requiring the agency to con-\nsider them.  Id. at 774.   \n \nThat holding cannot be extended to permit an agency \nto ignore reasonably foreseeable effects on the human \nenvironment solely on the ground that the federal pro-\nject would spur development or some other third-party \naction that in turn results in those effects.  As explained, \nsee pp. 4-5, supra, agencies are free to consider the at-\ntenuated or contingent nature of a harm or its material-\nity to the agency\u2019s decision in drawing a manageable \nline based on NEPA\u2019s underlying policies and the rule \nof reason.  But agencies must draw that line in context, \nand there is no categorical rule that could be applied to \n \n2 See, e.g., Fed. Highway Admin., U.S. Dep\u2019t of Transp., Instruc-\ntions for Reviewing Travel and Land Use Forecasting Analysis in \nNEPA Documents (Feb. 21, 2018), https://www.environment.fhwa. \ndot.gov/nepa/Travel_LandUse/forecasting_reviewer_guidance.aspx.  \n\n18 \n \nevery agency and project in determining whether a suf-\nficiently close causal connection exists. \n \n4. Petitioners likewise err to the extent they suggest \n(Br. 44) that agencies may ignore effects that fall out-\nside their \u201csubject-matter expertise.\u201d  NEPA expressly \ncontemplates that agencies will sometimes have to con-\nsider effects for which a different \u201cFederal agency\u201d \n\u201chas jurisdiction by law or special expertise.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \n4332(2)(C) (emphasis added); see 42 U.S.C. 4336a(a)(3) \n(permitting a lead agency to \u201cdesignate any Federal, \nState, Tribal, or local agency that has jurisdiction by \nlaw or special expertise with respect to any environmen-\ntal impact involved in a proposal to serve as a cooperat-\ning agency\u201d).  The statutorily mandated solution is co-\noperation and consultation with other agencies, not dis-\nregarding the effects altogether.  See Gov\u2019t Br. 31-33. \n \nMetropolitan Edison does not suggest otherwise.  \nPetitioners observe (Br. 44) that Metropolitan Edison \nstated that requiring agencies to consider the \u201cpsycho-\nlogical health damage caused by risk\u201d would mean that \nagencies would have \u201cto expend considerable resources \ndeveloping psychiatric expertise that is not otherwise \nrelevant to their congressionally assigned functions.\u201d  \n460 U.S. at 776.  But the Court explained that this was \na problem because spending resources to gain psychiat-\nric knowledge might divert agencies\u2019 attention and \nleave them \u201cunable adequately to pursue\u201d NEPA\u2019s core \npurposes\u2014the \u201cprotection of the physical environment \nand natural resources.\u201d  Ibid.  The concern was there-\nfore about a diversion of resources from NEPA\u2019s cen-\ntral environmental focus; the Court was not endorsing \na general rule excusing agencies from including any \nanalysis of environmental effects outside their area of \nexpertise.   \n\n19 \n \n \n5. Of course, none of this is to say that an agency \nmust engage in a detailed analysis of every reasonably \nforeseeable environmental harm.  The government \nagrees with petitioners that, as this Court has observed, \nagencies must be permitted to draw a \u201cmanageable\u201d \nline \u201cif NEPA\u2019s goal of \u2018insur[ing] a fully informed and \nwell-considered decision\u2019 is to be accomplished.\u201d  Met-\nropolitan Edison, 460 U.S. at 776 (citation omitted; \nbrackets in original).  But an agency must draw its line \nwith that goal in mind, focusing on the question of \nwhether\u2014in light of the nature of the project and the \ngoverning statutes\u2014the analysis of particular harms is \ncalled for by NEPA\u2019s standard of a reasonably close \ncausal relationship and its rule of reason.  Agencies can-\nnot simply rely on the rigid application of tort principles \nor bright-line and categorical rules regarding interven-\ning effects or agency expertise.   \nD. The Surface Transportation Board Reasonably Declined \nTo Perform Additional Analysis Of The Upstream And \nDownstream Effects Of Oil And Gas Development \nThe problems with an expansive gloss on NEPA are \nthrown into sharp relief by the environmental respond-\nents\u2019 attempt (Br. 28-29) to defend the D.C. Circuit\u2019s de-\ncision in this case regarding the Surface Transportation \nBoard\u2019s analysis of the upstream effects of oil and gas \ndevelopment in the Uinta Basin and the downstream ef-\nfects of refining in the Gulf Coast.   \n1. In preparing its environmental impact statement \nin connection with its authorization of a proposed rail \nline connecting the Uinta Basin to existing railways, the \nBoard engaged in detailed consideration of a wide range \nof potential environmental effects.  See Gov\u2019t Br. 6-8.  \nAmong those effects were the potential environmental \nconsequences of increases in oil and gas development in \n\n20 \n \nthe Uinta Basin that the new line might spur, and the \npotential increases in oil and gas refining.  See, e.g., J.A. \n351-362, 365-474.  The Board, for example, estimated \nthe aggregate additional emissions of greenhouse gases \nthat could occur from oil refining spurred by the new \nrail line.  J.A. 423. \nWhen the environmental respondents filed public \ncomments asserting that the almost 50 pages of analysis \nthat the draft environmental impact statement provided \nwith respect to the upstream and downstream effects of \noil and gas development were not sufficient, the Board \noffered a detailed response.  J.A. 520-529.  That response \nenumerated the various considerations that prompted \nthe Board to conclude that additional analysis of the up-\nstream and downstream effects of oil and gas develop-\nment would not \u201cinform\u201d its decisionmaking.  J.A. 521.  \nThe Board explained that the limited scope of its gov-\nerning statutes, the specific nature of the proposed ac-\ntion, and the attenuated, contingent, and speculative na-\nture of the effects all counseled against further analysis \nof the effects of oil and gas production in the Uinta Ba-\nsin and the localized effects of refining of the oil in dis-\ntant locations.  See J.A. 520-529; see also J.A. 421, 477-\n482; Pet. App. 107a-109a.  \nIn its final decision authorizing the new rail line, the \nBoard reiterated its explanation for declining to engage \nin additional analysis of these effects.  It observed that \nit \u201chas no authority or jurisdiction over development of \noil and gas in the Basin nor any authority to control or \nmitigate the impacts of any such development.\u201d  Pet. \nApp. 108a.  And it stated that \u201c[o]il and gas development \nthat may occur following authorization of the [new rail-\nroad line] would entail many separate and independent \nprojects that have not yet been proposed or planned and \n\n21 \n \nthat could occur on private, state, tribal, or federal land \nand could range in scale from a single vertical oil well to \na large lease.\u201d  Ibid.  With respect to the effects of oil \nrefining, the Board determined that \u201cthe actual volumes \nof crude oil that would move over the [new line] would \ndepend on various independent variables and influences, \nincluding general domestic and global economic condi-\ntions, commodity pricing, the strategic and capital in-\nvestment decisions of oil producers, and future market \ndemand for crude oil from the Basin.\u201d  Id. at 106a.  The \nBoard further observed that it has \u201cno jurisdiction or \ncontrol over the destinations or end uses of any prod-\nucts or commodities transported on the proposed rail \nline.\u201d  J.A. 422.   \nBecause the Board\u2019s explanation was reasonable and \nconsistent with NEPA\u2019s text and underlying policies \nand the rule of reason, there was no basis for the court \nof appeals to find it arbitrary and capricious.  Yet the \nenvironmental respondents insist (Br. 28-29) that the \nagency was obligated to perform the additional analysis \nthey requested because the \u201ceffects were likely to oc-\ncur,\u201d \u201c[t]he Board had enough information to consider \nthose effects,\u201d and it had \u201cundisputed authority\u201d to do \nso.  That conception of an agency\u2019s NEPA obligations \nthreatens to mire agencies in boundless NEPA review, \nforcing them to perform additional NEPA analysis any \ntime a challenger points to some additional information \nthe agency could have included in its environmental im-\npact statement\u2014no matter how tenuous the connection \nto the federal action or how unlikely it is that the addi-\ntional information would be material to the agency and \nthe public in the decisionmaking process.  The Court \nshould reject that understanding of NEPA and vacate \nthis aspect of the D.C. Circuit\u2019s decision.   \n\n22 \n \n2. There are no substantial grounds for the Court to \nproceed further and consider aspects of the D.C. Cir-\ncuit\u2019s decision that petitioners did not challenge in their \ncertiorari petition.  That petition focused exclusively on \nwhether the court of appeals had misapplied Public Cit-\nizen by finding that the Board was required to consider \nthe upstream and downstream effects of oil and gas de-\nvelopment.  See Pet. i.  In their merits brief before this \nCourt, however, petitioners assert (e.g., Br. 30-31) that \nthe court of appeals also erred in finding that the Board \nwas required to consider certain downline effects, such \nas potential rail accidents, forest fires, and effects on \nlocal bodies of water.  But whether or not the Board was \nrequired by NEPA to consider the downline risks of \nfires or rail accidents (including the possible effects of \nan oil spill resulting from an accident), it did so, in ac-\ncordance with the Board\u2019s environmental regulations \nand practice.  See, e.g., 49 C.F.R. 1105.7(e); J.A. 199, \n201, 220, 222.  \nIn any event, the argument that the Board was not \nrequired to consider those downline effects was not \nraised before the court of appeals.  The parties instead \ndisputed whether the Board had committed certain er-\nrors during its analysis of those downline effects.  See \nPet. App. 40a-45a.  The court therefore did not pass on \nthe question of whether the Board was required to con-\nsider the effects in the first place.  Because this Court \nis one \u201cof review, not of first view,\u201d and because the is-\nsue is not properly before the Court in any event, the \nCourt should decline to consider the issue.  Cutter v. \nWilkinson, 544 U.S. 709, 718 n.7 (2005).3  \n \n3 At times, petitioners also appear to challenge (Br. 43-47) the \nD.C. Circuit\u2019s determination that there were fact-specific errors in \n \n\n23 \n \nCONCLUSION \nThe judgment of the court of appeals should be  \nreversed in relevant part, and the case should be  \nremanded to the court of appeals for further proceed-\nings consistent with the Court\u2019s opinion. \nRespectfully submitted. \n \n \nELIZABETH B. PRELOGAR \nSolicitor General \n \n \nNOVEMBER 2024 \n \nthe Board\u2019s consideration of the downline effects.  See Cnty. Resp. \nBr. 40-43 (responding to these arguments).

          "task_beliefs": "My understanding of this case has now achieved a critical balance, moving from a one-sided view of the petitioners' arguments to a dialectical understanding of the core legal conflict. The foundational facts remain stable: the case concerns the scope of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) review for the Uinta Basin railway, specifically whether the Surface Transportation Board (STB) was required to analyze environmental effects beyond the immediate project area.\n\nMy knowledge has been profoundly deepened by analyzing the Brief for Respondent Eagle County, which directly answers the questions left open by the Solicitor General's brief and constructs a powerful counter-narrative:\n\n1.  **The Competing Framework:** The central dispute is now clear. It is a clash between two interpretations of NEPA's scope:\n    *   **Petitioners/SG Framework:** NEPA analysis is limited by common-law \"proximate causation\" and an agency's specific statutory authority. An agency need not study effects it cannot directly regulate or prevent. This view is anchored in their reading of *Department of Transp. v. Public Citizen*.\n    *   **Respondent Framework:** NEPA analysis is governed by a \"reasonable foreseeability\" standard, which focuses on whether information about an effect is *material* to the agency's decision-making process. This standard, they argue, is rooted in decades of case law, NEPA's regulations, and was recently codified by Congress.\n\n2.  **Respondent's Counter-Arguments:** Eagle County's brief directly attacks the petitioners' legal foundation:\n    *   **Rebutting Proximate Cause:** They argue that importing narrow tort-law liability concepts into NEPA contradicts the statute's broad informational purpose. They highlight that even *Metropolitan Edison Co. v. People Against Nuclear Energy*\u2014a case cited by petitioners\u2014explicitly stated it was *not* reading a tort-liability limit into NEPA.\n    *   **Distinguishing Precedent:** They contend *Metropolitan Edison* is irrelevant as it dealt with non-environmental psychological harms, whereas this case involves classic environmental risks like wildfires and oil spills. They counter the petitioners' reading of *Public Citizen* by arguing that NEPA's structure mandates *inter-agency cooperation*, not a \"pass-the-buck\" approach where an agency ignores effects simply because another agency has partial jurisdiction.\n    *   **Leveraging Recent Legislation:** In a key move, they turn the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023 against the petitioners. They argue that Congress's bipartisan decision to codify the \"reasonably foreseeable\" standard affirms the status quo and the D.C. Circuit's approach, making the petitioners' call for a new, narrower standard an inappropriate judicial intervention.\n\n3.  **Alternative Grounds for Affirmance (The \"Off-Ramp\"):** The respondents provide the Court with a way to rule in their favor on narrow grounds. They argue that the D.C. Circuit's judgment vacating the STB's approval should stand regardless of the main legal question, because the agency's analysis of specific downline impacts (like wildfire risk and potential oil spills on the Colorado River) was \"utterly unreasoned\" and factually deficient. This presents an \"off-ramp\" for the Court to avoid a broad ruling on NEPA's scope.\n\n4.  **Procedural Gambit:** The respondents suggest the writ of certiorari may have been \"improvidently granted\" because the petitioners have supposedly shifted their arguments since the cert stage. This is a tactical move to suggest the case is a poor vehicle for deciding the complex legal question presented.\n\n**Updated Prediction:** My previous strong lean toward reversal is now significantly moderated. The respondents have presented a compelling, textually-grounded argument that I previously lacked. The case is now much closer to a toss-up. The outcome will likely depend on whether the Court's majority is more persuaded by the SG's desire for a clear, authority-based limit on NEPA review, or by the respondents' argument that \"reasonable foreseeability\" is the long-standing, congressionally-approved standard. The presence of the \"off-ramp\" argument creates a real possibility of a narrow ruling in favor of the respondents, affirming the judgment below without resolving the central legal conflict. My uncertainty has increased, but my understanding of the decision space is far more robust.",
          "design_beliefs": "My strategic framework for legal analysis continues to be refined through practice, with this observation providing powerful validation for recently developed principles and generating new, more sophisticated heuristics.\n\n1.  **Foundational Beliefs (Stable):** The core strategies of **categorizing the legal question** and **analyzing primary source documents** remain the essential foundation of my process.\n2.  **Information Retrieval Strategy (Stable):** The **\"Reflect-Adapt-Retry\" cycle** for information gathering remains a validated and effective method.\n3.  **Source Prioritization (Refined Heuristic):** My source hierarchy is now more complete. The top tier of essential documents for understanding a case's merits consists of the **briefs from the Petitioner, the Respondent, and the Solicitor General.** The respondent's brief is not secondary; it is an equally critical pillar for constructing a balanced model of the legal dispute.\n4.  **Predictive Signals (Refined Heuristics):**\n    *   **\"Always determine the position of the Solicitor General.\"** (Stable)\n    *   **\"Identify the key contested precedent.\"** (Stable) This case confirms the centrality of *Public Citizen* and *Metropolitan Edison*.\n\n5.  **Argument Analysis (Validated & New Heuristics):**\n    *   **\"Actively seek out and model the counterargument.\" (Validated)** This principle has been proven to be of paramount importance. My previous, one-sided belief state was brittle and likely inaccurate. By obtaining and integrating the respondent's brief, I have moved from a state of high confidence/low information to one of moderate confidence/high information, which is a much more robust basis for prediction. This confirms that a dialectical approach is non-negotiable for high-quality analysis.\n    *   **(New) \"Look for 'off-ramps' and alternative holdings.\"** I have learned that skilled advocates often provide the Court with a narrow, case-specific path to rule in their favor. The respondents' focus on the STB's \"utterly unreasoned\" factual errors is a classic \"off-ramp\" that would allow the Court to affirm the lower court's judgment without making a broad, precedent-setting legal declaration. Identifying these is crucial for understanding the full spectrum of potential outcomes.\n    *   **(New) \"Analyze how all parties frame recent legislative action.\"** When Congress legislates in a relevant area during litigation, it becomes a critical interpretive battleground. It's not enough to see how one side uses it; an effective analysis requires understanding how *both* sides will attempt to weaponize or co-opt that new text. Here, both parties claim the Fiscal Responsibility Act supports their view of NEPA.\n    *   **(New) \"Identify procedural gambits.\"** The respondents' suggestion to dismiss the writ as improvidently granted (\"DIG\") is a procedural tactic aimed at the Court itself. Recognizing these moves is important for a complete analysis of case strategy and potential non-merits-based outcomes.\n\n6.  **Process Methodology (Validated):** The **\"Integrate-Reflect-Plan\" cycle** has once again proven its value. My previous reflection correctly identified the largest uncertainty (the respondent's argument), and the subsequent plan (search for their brief) successfully resolved it. The next step in this cycle would be to reflect on the now-balanced arguments and plan to seek out key amicus briefs to see which arguments are gaining the most external support."

          "task_beliefs": "My model of this case has evolved from a simple binary conflict to a more complex, three-sided legal negotiation. The introduction of the Solicitor General's (SG) reply brief has clarified the government's position, revealing it as a distinct, mediating stance between the petitioners and respondents.\n\n1.  **The Three Competing Frameworks:** The central dispute is no longer a simple dialectic but a triangular contest over the correct standard for NEPA's scope:\n    *   **Petitioners' Framework (Hard Limit):** NEPA analysis is strictly limited by common-law \"proximate causation\" and an agency's direct regulatory authority. This is a bright-line rule.\n    *   **Respondent's Framework (Broad Mandate):** NEPA analysis is governed by a \"reasonable foreseeability\" standard, where foreseeability is the primary, if not sole, limiting principle.\n    *   **Solicitor General's Framework (Flexible Standard):** This is a \"middle way.\" The SG agrees with the respondents that a strict tort-law proximate cause standard is wrong (*Metropolitan Edison* rejected it). However, the SG agrees with the petitioners that \"reasonable foreseeability\" is not the *only* limit. The SG advocates for a flexible, deferential standard where agencies can draw \"manageable, context-specific lines\" based on a \"rule of reason.\" This standard allows an agency to exclude effects that are too attenuated, speculative, or not useful to its decision-making process, even if factually foreseeable.\n\n2.  **The SG's Strategic Positioning:** The SG's reply brief is a masterclass in strategic positioning. While formally \"supporting petitioners,\" the SG explicitly distances the government from their core legal test, stating, **\"Petitioners err to the extent they endorse bright-line rules that find no footing in NEPA\u2019s text,\"** specifically rejecting the importation of tort-law proximate cause. This move provides the Court with a \"Goldilocks\" option\u2014a standard that is neither as restrictive as the petitioners' nor as expansive as the respondents'.\n\n3.  **The Battle Over the \"Off-Ramp\":** The respondents' strategy of offering a narrow, fact-based \"off-ramp\" (arguing the STB's analysis was \"utterly unreasoned\") has been directly challenged. The SG's brief urges the Court to decide the main legal question and \"decline petitioners\u2019 request to reach beyond the question presented.\" This signals that the U.S. government, as the primary entity bound by NEPA, has a strong interest in obtaining a clear, nationwide ruling on the scope of environmental review, rather than a punt on case-specific facts. This increases the likelihood of a broad, precedential decision.\n\n4.  **The Fiscal Responsibility Act as a Contested Weapon:** The SG's brief counters the respondents' narrative that the Act's codification of \"reasonably foreseeable\" endorsed their broad view. The SG argues that the Act was intended to *streamline* and *limit* NEPA burdens (citing new page limits), making it illogical to assume Congress simultaneously intended to dramatically expand the scope of required analysis. This reframes the legislation as supporting a more constrained, manageable approach.\n\n**Updated Prediction:** My prediction has shifted from a \"toss-up\" to a **moderate-to-high confidence in reversal, but on the Solicitor General's terms.** The SG has provided the Court with a well-reasoned, practical, and deferential standard that avoids the extremes of both parties. This middle path is highly attractive as it allows the Court to rein in the D.C. Circuit's expansive test without adopting the petitioners' rigid and potentially problematic tort-law analogy. The most probable outcome is an opinion that reverses the D.C. Circuit, vacates the judgment, and remands, while articulating a new standard for NEPA scope that closely mirrors the \"rule of reason\" and \"manageable lines\" framework advocated by the Solicitor General.",
          "design_beliefs": "This observation has significantly refined my analytical heuristics, particularly concerning the role of reply briefs and the strategic positioning of key parties like the Solicitor General.\n\n1.  **Foundational Beliefs (Stable):** The core strategies of **categorizing the legal question** and **analyzing primary source documents** remain essential.\n2.  **Information Retrieval Strategy (Stable):** The **\"Reflect-Adapt-Retry\" cycle** for information gathering continues to be effective.\n3.  **Source Prioritization (Refined Heuristic):** The \"trio\" of Petitioner, Respondent, and SG briefs is the core. However, this is now expanded: **\"Always obtain and analyze the Reply Briefs, especially the SG's.\"** The reply brief is not redundant; it is where a party sharpens its arguments, makes critical concessions, and, crucially, distinguishes its position from its allies. It is a source of high-value, nuanced signals.\n4.  **Predictive Signals (Refined Heuristics):**\n    *   **\"Always determine the position of the Solicitor General.\"** (Stable)\n    *   **\"Identify the key contested precedent.\"** (Stable)\n5.  **Argument Analysis (Validated & New Heuristics):**\n    *   **\"Actively seek out and model the counterargument.\" (Validated)** This remains a non-negotiable principle for robust analysis.\n    *   **\"Look for 'off-ramps' and alternative holdings.\" (Refined) \u2192 \"Look for 'off-ramps' and identify who is trying to close them.\"** It's not enough to spot a narrow exit. Identifying which party (here, the SG) is actively arguing *against* that exit is a powerful signal about the stakes and what the most sophisticated actors want from the case (i.e., a clear rule).\n    *   **\"Analyze how all parties frame recent legislative action.\" (Validated)** The SG's use of the Fiscal Responsibility Act's streamlining purpose to counter the respondents' textual argument is a perfect example of this principle in action.\n    *   **\"Identify procedural gambits.\"** (Stable)\n    *   **(New) \"Identify the 'Goldilocks' position.\"** In complex administrative or statutory cases, the SG often carves out a middle-ground standard that is more moderate than the primary litigants. This \"just right\" position is often designed to be adopted by the Court as a workable standard that preserves executive branch flexibility. Finding this \"third way\" is a key predictive task.\n    *   **(New) \"Pay close attention when a party critiques its own 'side'.\"** When a supporting party, especially the SG, explicitly disagrees with the main petitioner's legal test (e.g., \"Petitioners err...\"), it is a critical signal. It highlights a perceived weakness in the original argument and reveals the contours of a more defensible, moderate position that is likely to attract a majority of the Court.\n\n6.  **Process Methodology (Validated):** The **\"Integrate-Reflect-Plan\" cycle** is working well. Having integrated the respondent's brief and now the SG's reply, my model of the case is far more sophisticated. The next logical step is to acquire the *petitioner's* reply brief to see how they react to the SG's partial dissent from their position and the respondents' strong counter-arguments."

App. 1a-71a) \nis reported at 82 F.4th 1152.  The decisions of the Sur-\nface Transportation Board (Pet. App. 74a-190a; 190a-\n230a) are available at 2021 WL 41926 and 2021 WL \n5960905. \nJURISDICTION \nThe judgment of the court of appeals was entered on \nAugust 18, 2023.  A petition for rehearing en banc was \ndenied on December 4, 2023 (Pet. App. 72a-73a).  The \npetition for a writ of certiorari was timely filed on \nMarch 4, 2024 (Monday).  The jurisdiction of this Court \nis invoked under 28 U.S.C. 1254(1). \n\n2 \n \nSTATEMENT \n1. This case involves a challenge to the federal gov-\nernment\u2019s authorization of a new railway line in the \nUinta Basin in Utah.  Pet. App. 3a.1  \na. The Interstate Commerce Commission Termina-\ntion Act of 1995 (the Interstate Commerce Act), 49 \nU.S.C. 10101 et seq., provides the Surface Transporta-\ntion Board (Board) with authority to license the con-\nstruction and operation of new railroad lines in the in-\nterstate rail system.  See Alaska Survival v. Surface \nTransp. Bd., 705 F.3d 1073, 1078 (9th Cir. 2013).  The \nBoard\u2019s authorization of a new line takes one of two \nforms.  First, if an applicant submits a full application \nto build a new railroad line, the Board must grant the \nauthorization \u201cunless the Board finds that such activi-\nties are inconsistent with the public convenience and ne-\ncessity.\u201d  49 U.S.C. 10901(c).  Second, as in this case, an \napplicant may request Board authorization through an \n\u201cexemption\u201d process under 49 U.S.C. 10502.  \nThe Board may grant an exemption authorizing rail \nconstruction when it finds that (1) a full proceeding un-\nder Section 10901 \u201cis not necessary to carry out\u201d the rail \ntransportation policy in Section 10101 of the Interstate \nCommerce Act, and (2) either that (a) the transaction is \nlimited in scope, or (b) the application of Section 10901 \n\u201cis not needed to protect shippers from the abuse of \nmarket power.\u201d  49 U.S.C. 10502.  In an exemption pro-\nceeding, the Board considers the transportation merits \nof a project by looking to the exemption criteria in \n \n1 Federal respondent the Surface Transportation Board assessed \nthe petition for a writ of certiorari and the Board was unable to \nreach a majority decision on the response.  Accordingly, the Board \ndoes not join this opposition or otherwise take a position on the pe-\ntition. \n\n3 \n \nSection 10502, which in turn requires the Board to ana-\nlyze the rail transportation policy factors identified in \nSection 10101. \nb. The National Environmental Policy Act of 1996 \n(NEPA), 42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq., requires agencies to \ntake a \u201chard look\u201d at the environmental consequences \nof a proposed major federal action.  See, e.g., Baltimore \nGas & Elec. Co. v. Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc., 462 \nU.S. 87, 97 (1983).  When an agency determines that a \nmajor federal action will have potentially significant en-\nvironmental impacts, it must prepare an environmental \nimpact statement.  42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C).  Under NEPA, \nan agency must consider an environmental effect of a \nproposed major federal action if there is a \u201c\u2018reasonably \nclose causal relationship\u2019 between the environmental ef-\nfect and the alleged cause.\u201d  Department of Transp. v. \nPublic Citizen, 541 U.S. 752, 767 (2004) (quoting Metro-\npolitan Edison Co. v. People Against Nuclear Energy, \n460 U.S. 766, 774 (1983)).  This Court has \u201canalogized \nthis requirement to the \u2018familiar doctrine of proximate \ncause from tort law.\u2019\u201d  Ibid. (citation omitted).  It has \nalso held that \u201cwhere an agency has no ability to pre-\nvent a certain effect due to its limited statutory author-\nity over the relevant actions, the agency cannot be con-\nsidered a legally relevant \u2018cause\u2019 of the effect.\u201d  Id. at \n770. \n2. Petitioners seek to build an 85-mile-long railway \nline in Utah connecting the Uinta Basin in northeastern \nUtah to the existing interstate freight rail network near \nKyune, Utah.  Pet. App. 190a.  Presently, all freight \nmoving in and out of the Uinta Basin is transported by \ntrucks on the area\u2019s limited road network.  Id. at 192a.  \nThe proposed rail line would connect the Uinta Basin to \nthe interstate rail network to provide shippers with an \n\n4 \n \nalternative to trucking.  Id. at 192a, 206a, 208a.  Though \nthe new railway could carry any goods produced or con-\nsumed in the Basin, \u201cthe [petitioners] recognize[] (and \nno one disputes) that the Railway\u2019s predominant and ex-\npected primary purpose would be the transport of waxy \ncrude oil produced in the Uinta Basin.\u201d  Id. at 7a. \nIn May 2020, petitioners sought authorization to con-\nstruct and operate the railway through the Interstate \nCommerce Act\u2019s exemption process and requested that \nthe Board issue a preliminary decision addressing the \ntransportation merits of the exemption before complet-\ning its environmental review.  Pet. App. 6a, 8a.  The \nBoard issued a non-binding preliminary decision in Jan-\nuary 2021 assessing the railway\u2019s transportation merits.  \nId. at 191a.  The Board found, subject to the completion \nof the environmental review, that the railway met the \nstandards for an exemption under Section 10502 of the \nInterstate Commerce Act.  Ibid. \nMeanwhile, the Board performed an environmental \nanalysis under NEPA, issuing a draft environmental \nimpact statement in October 2020, and a final statement \nin August 2021.  Pet. App. 10a.  In addition, to comply \nwith the Endangered Species Act of 1973, 16 U.S.C. \n1531 et seq., the Board consulted with the Fish and \nWildlife Service (Service) regarding the effect of the \nnew railway on endangered species, and the Service is-\nsued a final biological opinion in September 2021.  Pet. \nApp. 11a.  Several months later, the Board issued its fi-\nnal exemption decision, which authorized construction \nand operation of the railway subject to environmental \nmitigation conditions.  Id. at 74a-189a. \n3. Eagle County, Colorado and several environmen-\ntal organizations filed two petitions for review\u2014which \nthe court of appeals consolidated\u2014challenging the \n\n5 \n \nBoard\u2019s preliminary and final exemption decisions, as \nwell as the Service\u2019s biological opinion.  See Pet. App. \n13a.   \nThe court of appeals granted the petitions in part \nand denied them in part.  Pet. App. 1a-71a.  The court \nconcluded that Eagle County and the environmental or-\nganizations had standing to challenge both the Board\u2019s \ndecisions and the Service\u2019s biological opinion.  Id. at \n14a-22a.  The court also held that it had subject-matter \njurisdiction to review the Board\u2019s decisions under the \nHobbs Act.  Id. at 22a-23a.  And the court held that it \nhad jurisdiction to review the Service\u2019s biological opin-\nion because the Board had relied on and incorporated \nthe opinion into its final exemption decision, and the \nBoard\u2019s decisions are subject to review exclusively in \nthe courts of appeals.  Id. at 23a.  The court then re-\nsolved numerous challenges to the merits of the federal \nagency actions in connection with the railway authori-\nzation.  Id. at 25a-69a.   \na. As most relevant here, the court of appeals held \nthat the Board\u2019s NEPA analysis should have considered \nthe upstream environmental effects of increased oil de-\nvelopment and the downstream effects of refining that \noil.  Pet. App. 30a-37a.  The court explained that the \nBoard had offered two primary reasons for excluding \nthose effects, and neither was sufficient to justify the \nagency\u2019s decision.  Id. at 30a-31a.   \nFirst, the court of appeals rejected the Board\u2019s con-\ntention that, because of the agency\u2019s \u201c\u200a\u2018lack of infor-\nmation about the\u2019 location of future oil production sites\u201d \nand the \u201c\u200a\u2018destination and end use of the [oil],\u2019\u200a\u201d the up-\nstream and downstream effects were not \u201c\u200a\u2018reasonably \nforeseeable impacts\u2019\u201d that the Board was required to \nconsider.  Pet. App. 30a, 32a (citations omitted; brackets \n\n6 \n \nin original).  The court found that the Board had \n\u201cfail[ed] to adequately explain why it could not employ \n\u2018some degree of forecasting\u2019 to identify the aforemen-\ntioned upstream and downstream impacts.\u201d  Id. at 35a \n(citation omitted).   \nSecond, the court of appeals rejected the Board\u2019s \ncontention that, under this Court\u2019s decision in Public \nCitizen, supra, it was not required to \u201cidentify and de-\nscribe the environmental effects of increased oil drilling \nand refining\u201d because the agency \u201clack[ed] the author-\nity to prevent, control, or mitigate those developments.\u201d  \nPet. App. 36a.  In the court\u2019s view, the Board had the \nauthority to prevent those effects, observing that the \nBoard had \u201cexclusive jurisdiction over the construction \nand operation of the railway, including authority to \ndeny the exemption petition if the environmental harm \ncaused by the railway outweighs its transportation ben-\nefits.\u201d  Ibid. (citing 49 U.S.C. 10501(c) and 10901(b)).  \nThe court also reasoned that the Board \u201cis authorized \nto license railroad construction and operation based on \nthe \u2018public convenience and necessity,\u2019\u200a\u201d which, the court \nconcluded, \u201cencompasses reasonably foreseeable envi-\nronmental harms.\u201d  Id. at 37a (citation omitted).  Based \non this analysis of the Board\u2019s \u201cauthority to deny an ex-\nemption to a railway project on the ground that the rail-\nway\u2019s anticipated environmental and other costs out-\nweigh its expected benefits,\u201d the court found that \u201cthe \nBoard\u2019s argument that it need not consider effects it \ncannot prevent\u201d was \u201csimply inapplicable.\u201d  Ibid.   \nb. The court of appeals also identified several other \nflaws in the Board\u2019s NEPA analysis, including its fail-\nure to take a hard look at the increased risk of rail acci-\ndents downline, Pet. App. 40a-42a, the risk and impacts \nof wildfires downline, id. at 42a-45a, and the railway\u2019s \n\n7 \n \nimpacts on water resources downline on the Colorado \nRiver, id. at 46a-47a.  In addition, the court rejected or \ndeclined to reach multiple other challenges under \nNEPA and the National Historic Preservation Act, 54 \nU.S.C. 304108.  Pet. App. 29a, 37a-39a, 47a-50a, 55a-57a.  \nThe court also found flaws in the Service\u2019s biological \nopinion, Id. at 50a-55a, and in the Board\u2019s exemption de-\ncision under the Interstate Commerce Act, Pet. App. \n57a-69a.   \nBased on the errors in the NEPA analysis and the \nbiological opinion, the \u201cfail[ure] to conduct a reasoned \napplication\u201d of the Interstate Commerce Act, and the \nBoard\u2019s \u201cfail[ure] to weigh the [railway\u2019s] uncertain fi-\nnancial viability and the full potential for environmental \nharm against the transportation benefits it identified,\u201d \nthe court of appeals vacated the exemption order as ar-\nbitrary and capricious, and partially vacated the under-\nlying NEPA assessment and biological opinion.  Pet. \nApp. 70a; see id. at 70a-71a.   \n4. Petitioners sought rehearing en banc.  The court \nof appeals denied the petition, with no judge calling for \na vote.  Pet. App. 72a\u201373a. \nARGUMENT \nPetitioners contend (Pet. 14-21) that this Court \nshould grant the petition for a writ of certiorari to re-\nsolve a disagreement in the circuits regarding the \nproper application of this Court\u2019s decision in Depart-\nment of Transp. v. Public Citizen, 541 U.S. 752 (2004).  \nThis Court\u2019s review is unwarranted because there is no \ncircuit conflict regarding the proper application of Pub-\nlic Citizen\u2019s holding that NEPA does not require an \nagency to analyze environmental effects when the \nagency \u201chas no ability to prevent\u201d those effects \u201cdue to \nits limited statutory authority.\u201d  Id. at 770.  What \n\n8 \n \npetitioners describe as differences in the courts of ap-\npeals\u2019 understanding of Public Citizen are more appro-\npriately attributed to variations in the statutory and \nregulatory authority wielded by different agencies in \ndifferent contexts.  And even if this Court were of the \nview that the question presented might warrant review \nat some point, this case would be a poor vehicle because, \namong other things, the government recently issued \nnew regulations regarding the appropriate scope of \nNEPA review, and because the court of appeals identi-\nfied several other flaws in the agency\u2019s NEPA analysis \nthat will require a revised environmental impact state-\nment regardless of the outcome of this case.  The peti-\ntion for a writ of certiorari should therefore be denied.    \n1. The courts of appeals uniformly recognize that, \nunder Public Citizen, an agency need not consider en-\nvironmental consequences it lacks the statutory and \nregulatory authority to prevent.     \na. In Public Citizen, the Court considered whether \nan agency had reasonably excluded certain environmen-\ntal effects from its NEPA analysis based on the \nagency\u2019s limited statutory mandate.  541 U.S. at 767.  \nThe case involved a NEPA challenge to safety regula-\ntions for Mexican tractor-trailer trucks that the Federal \nMotor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) prom-\nulgated after the President agreed to lift a moratorium \non the entry of Mexican trucks into the United States.  \nId. at 756, 760-761.  The agency\u2019s NEPA analysis con-\nsidered the environmental consequences of the roadside \ninspections required by its new safety rules.  But the \nanalysis did not consider the consequences of the in-\ncreased presence of Mexican trucks in the United \nStates because FMCSA determined that the increased \npresence was due to the President\u2019s decision to lift the \n\n9 \n \nmoratorium, rather than the agency\u2019s new regulations.  \nId. at 761.  Several challengers asserted that limiting \nthe NEPA analysis in that way was improper because \nthe trucks\u2019 presence should be considered an effect of \nthe regulations, on the theory that no Mexican truck \ncould operate in the United States without obtaining a \ncertification from FMCSA, and FMCSA could not issue \nany certifications for Mexican trucks until it promul-\ngated the safety rules.  Id. at 765-766.   \nThis Court rejected the challenge, finding that the \nscope of the agency\u2019s NEPA analysis was appropriate \nbecause the agency\u2019s governing statutes prevented it \nfrom barring Mexican trucks based on the environmen-\ntal effects of their entry.  Public Citizen, 541 U.S. at \n765; see id. at 767-770.  The Court explained that, while \nFMCSA was required to ensure the safety and financial \nresponsibility of the trucks operating within the United \nStates, it had no \u201cability to countermand the President\u2019s \nlifting of the moratorium or otherwise categorically to \nexclude Mexican motor carriers from operating in the \nUnited States.\u201d  Id. at 766.  To the contrary, the Court \nexplained, it would \u201cviolate\u201d the agency\u2019s statutory \nmandate for FMCSA to refuse to authorize a Mexican \nmotor carrier that was \u201cwilling and able to comply with \nthe various substantive requirements for safety and fi-\nnancial responsibility.\u201d  Ibid.  \nThe Court declined to adopt the challengers\u2019 \u201cpartic-\nularly unyielding variation of \u2018but for\u2019 causation, where \nan agency\u2019s action is considered a cause of an environ-\nmental effect even when the agency has no authority to \nprevent the effect.\u201d  Public Citizen, 541 U.S. at 767.  \nThe Court explained that the challengers\u2019 theory con-\nflicted with its prior decision in Metropolitan Edison \nCo. v. People Against Nuclear Energy, 460 U.S. 766 \n\n10 \n \n(1983), which had drawn an analogy to the doctrine of \nproximate cause under tort law and encouraged courts \nto look to NEPA\u2019s \u201cunderlying policies\u201d to draw \u201ca man-\nageable line between those causal changes that may \nmake\u201d an agency responsible for an effect under NEPA \n\u201cand those that do not.\u2019\u201d  Public Citizen, 541 U.S. at 767 \n(quoting Metropolitan Edison, 460 U.S. at 774 n.7).  The \nCourt also relied on the \u201crule of reason\u201d that is \u201cinher-\nent in NEPA and its implementing regulations,\u201d ob-\nserving that \u201cno rule of reason worthy of that title would \nrequire an agency\u201d to analyze environmental effects \nwhen the results of that analysis \u201cwould serve \u2018no pur-\npose.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Ibid. (citation omitted).    \nBased on Metropolitan Edison and the rule of rea-\nson, the Court held that \u201cwhere an agency has no ability \nto prevent a particular effect due to its limited statutory \nauthority over the relevant actions, the agency cannot \nbe considered a legally relevant \u2018cause\u2019 of that effect.\u201d  \nPublic Citizen, 541 U.S. at 770.  And because FMSCA \n\u201csimply lack[ed] the power to act on\u201d the information \nthat would have been produced by an analysis of the en-\nvironmental consequences of permitting Mexican \ntrucks to enter the United States, the Court found that \nthe agency had acted reasonably in excluding the con-\nsideration of those effects from its NEPA analysis.  Id. \nat 768.  \nb. The courts of appeals have relied on Public Citi-\nzen\u2019s holding to affirm the reasonableness of an \nagency\u2019s decision to exclude a particular environmental \neffect from its NEPA analysis where\u2014under the gov-\nerning statutory and regulatory scheme\u2014the agency \nhad \u201cno ability to prevent\u201d that effect.  541 U.S. at 770.  \nIn Center for Biological Diversity v. U.S. Army Corps \nof Engineers, 941 F.3d 1288 (2019), for example, the \n\n11 \n \nEleventh Circuit held that the Army Corps of Engi-\nneers\u2019 decision not to consider certain environmental ef-\nfects in issuing a discharge permit under the Clean Wa-\nter Act was consistent with Public Citizen because the \nCorps could not have \u201chinge[d] its permitting decision\u201d \non the relevant effects without \u201cignoring the Clean Wa-\nter Act\u2019s text and misapplying its implementing regula-\ntions.\u201d  Id. at 1298.   \nSimilarly, in Ohio Valley Environmental Coalition \nv. Aracoma Coal Co., 556 F.3d 177 (2009), cert denied, \n561 U.S. 1051 (2010), the Fourth Circuit determined \nthat, under Public Citizen, the Corps was not required \nto consider the environmental effects of coal mining op-\nerations as a whole in issuing a permit for certain \ndredge and fill activities because the governing regula-\ntions assigned the \u201ccontrol and responsibility\u201d for the \nmining operations to a different agency.  Id. at 196-197.  \nAnd in Kentuckians for the Commonwealth v. United \nStates Army Corps of Engineers, 746 F.3d 698 (2014), \nthe Sixth Circuit found that Public Citizen supported \nthe Corps\u2019 determination that it did not need to consider \nthe health effects of a mining project as a whole in issu-\ning a specific permit because the agency had deter-\nmined that it lacked \u201c\u200a\u2018sufficient control and responsibil-\nity\u2019 over the whole project\u201d under the \u201ccomplete regu-\nlatory scheme.\u201d  Id. at 710 (citation omitted).   \nCourts have also cited the limited statutory and reg-\nulatory authority of other agencies in upholding the rea-\nsonableness of limits those agencies have placed on \ntheir NEPA analyses.  Thus, in New Jersey Department \nof Environmental Protection v. United States Nuclear \nRegulatory Commission, 561 F.3d 132 (2009), the Third \nCircuit determined that the Nuclear Regulatory Com-\nmission\u2019s lack of \u201cauthority over the airspace above its \n\n12 \n \nfacilities\u201d supported the agency\u2019s determination that it \ndid not need to consider the environmental effects of an \nair attack on a nuclear facility.  Id. at 139; see id. at 140 \n(explaining that the agency\u2019s \u201clack of control over air-\nspace supports our holding\u201d); see also Protect Our \nParks, Inc. v. Buttigieg, 39 F.4th 389, 393, 400 (7th Cir. \n2022) (citing Public Citizen in holding that a federal \nagency was not required to consider a potential regula-\ntory option it lacked any authority to undertake).   \nThe D.C. Circuit, too, has recognized that an \nagency\u2019s governing statutory and regulatory frame-\nwork may limit the scope of its NEPA obligations.  In \nSierra Club v. FERC, 827 F.3d 36 (2016) (Freeport), the \nD.C. Circuit held that the Federal Energy Regulatory \nCommission (FERC) was not required \u201cto address the \nindirect effects of the anticipated export of natural gas\u201d \nas part of its NEPA analysis of the authorization of new \nnatural gas facilities because \u201cthe Department of En-\nergy, not the Commission, has sole authority to license \nthe export of any natural gas going through the [new] \nfacilities.\u201d  Id. at 47 (emphasis omitted).  The court ex-\nplained that \u201c[i]n the specific circumstances where, as \nhere, an agency \u2018has no ability to prevent a certain ef-\nfect due to\u2019 that agency\u2019s \u2018limited statutory authority \nover the relevant action,\u2019\u200a\u201d the agency need not consider \nthat effect.  Ibid. (quoting Public Citizen, 541 U.S. at \n771).   \nThe D.C. Circuit reached the same conclusion in two \nother cases involving challenges to FERC\u2019s decision to \nexclude the environmental effects of the export of natu-\nral gas from its NEPA analyses.  Sierra Club v. FERC, \n827 F.3d 59 (2016) (Sabine Pass); EarthReports, Inc. v. \nFERC, 828 F.3d 949 (2016).  And in a fourth case, Sierra \nClub v. FERC, 867 F.3d 1357 (D.C. Cir. 2017) (Sabal \n\n13 \n \nTrail), the court of appeals applied the same principles, \nbut found that Public Citizen did not support FERC\u2019s \ndecision to exclude certain adverse environmental ef-\nfects from its NEPA analysis of the propriety of issuing \na pipeline certificate because of differences in the gov-\nerning statute.  Id. at 1372-1373.  The court explained \nthat, in the first three cases, FERC could not have con-\nsidered the environmental effects of natural gas exports \n\u201cwhen regulating in its proper sphere.\u201d  Ibid.  But the \ncourt determined that in Sabal Trail, the agency \n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

App. 1a-71a) \nis reported at 82 F.4th 1152.  The decisions of the Sur-\nface Transportation Board (Pet. App. 74a-190a; 190a-\n230a) are available at 2021 WL 41926 and 2021 WL \n5960905. \nJURISDICTION \nThe judgment of the court of appeals was entered on \nAugust 18, 2023.  A petition for rehearing en banc was \ndenied on December 4, 2023 (Pet. App. 72a-73a).  The \npetition for a writ of certiorari was timely filed on \nMarch 4, 2024 (Monday).  The jurisdiction of this Court \nis invoked under 28 U.S.C. 1254(1). \n\n2 \n \nSTATEMENT \n1. This case involves a challenge to the federal gov-\nernment\u2019s authorization of a new railway line in the \nUinta Basin in Utah.  Pet. App. 3a.1  \na. The Interstate Commerce Commission Termina-\ntion Act of 1995 (the Interstate Commerce Act), 49 \nU.S.C. 10101 et seq., provides the Surface Transporta-\ntion Board (Board) with authority to license the con-\nstruction and operation of new railroad lines in the in-\nterstate rail system.  See Alaska Survival v. Surface \nTransp. Bd., 705 F.3d 1073, 1078 (9th Cir. 2013).  The \nBoard\u2019s authorization of a new line takes one of two \nforms.  First, if an applicant submits a full application \nto build a new railroad line, the Board must grant the \nauthorization \u201cunless the Board finds that such activi-\nties are inconsistent with the public convenience and ne-\ncessity.\u201d  49 U.S.C. 10901(c).  Second, as in this case, an \napplicant may request Board authorization through an \n\u201cexemption\u201d process under 49 U.S.C. 10502.  \nThe Board may grant an exemption authorizing rail \nconstruction when it finds that (1) a full proceeding un-\nder Section 10901 \u201cis not necessary to carry out\u201d the rail \ntransportation policy in Section 10101 of the Interstate \nCommerce Act, and (2) either that (a) the transaction is \nlimited in scope, or (b) the application of Section 10901 \n\u201cis not needed to protect shippers from the abuse of \nmarket power.\u201d  49 U.S.C. 10502.  In an exemption pro-\nceeding, the Board considers the transportation merits \nof a project by looking to the exemption criteria in \n \n1 Federal respondent the Surface Transportation Board assessed \nthe petition for a writ of certiorari and the Board was unable to \nreach a majority decision on the response.  Accordingly, the Board \ndoes not join this opposition or otherwise take a position on the pe-\ntition. \n\n3 \n \nSection 10502, which in turn requires the Board to ana-\nlyze the rail transportation policy factors identified in \nSection 10101. \nb. The National Environmental Policy Act of 1996 \n(NEPA), 42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq., requires agencies to \ntake a \u201chard look\u201d at the environmental consequences \nof a proposed major federal action.  See, e.g., Baltimore \nGas & Elec. Co. v. Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc., 462 \nU.S. 87, 97 (1983).  When an agency determines that a \nmajor federal action will have potentially significant en-\nvironmental impacts, it must prepare an environmental \nimpact statement.  42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C).  Under NEPA, \nan agency must consider an environmental effect of a \nproposed major federal action if there is a \u201c\u2018reasonably \nclose causal relationship\u2019 between the environmental ef-\nfect and the alleged cause.\u201d  Department of Transp. v. \nPublic Citizen, 541 U.S. 752, 767 (2004) (quoting Metro-\npolitan Edison Co. v. People Against Nuclear Energy, \n460 U.S. 766, 774 (1983)).  This Court has \u201canalogized \nthis requirement to the \u2018familiar doctrine of proximate \ncause from tort law.\u2019\u201d  Ibid. (citation omitted).  It has \nalso held that \u201cwhere an agency has no ability to pre-\nvent a certain effect due to its limited statutory author-\nity over the relevant actions, the agency cannot be con-\nsidered a legally relevant \u2018cause\u2019 of the effect.\u201d  Id. at \n770. \n2. Petitioners seek to build an 85-mile-long railway \nline in Utah connecting the Uinta Basin in northeastern \nUtah to the existing interstate freight rail network near \nKyune, Utah.  Pet. App. 190a.  Presently, all freight \nmoving in and out of the Uinta Basin is transported by \ntrucks on the area\u2019s limited road network.  Id. at 192a.  \nThe proposed rail line would connect the Uinta Basin to \nthe interstate rail network to provide shippers with an \n\n4 \n \nalternative to trucking.  Id. at 192a, 206a, 208a.  Though \nthe new railway could carry any goods produced or con-\nsumed in the Basin, \u201cthe [petitioners] recognize[] (and \nno one disputes) that the Railway\u2019s predominant and ex-\npected primary purpose would be the transport of waxy \ncrude oil produced in the Uinta Basin.\u201d  Id. at 7a. \nIn May 2020, petitioners sought authorization to con-\nstruct and operate the railway through the Interstate \nCommerce Act\u2019s exemption process and requested that \nthe Board issue a preliminary decision addressing the \ntransportation merits of the exemption before complet-\ning its environmental review.  Pet. App. 6a, 8a.  The \nBoard issued a non-binding preliminary decision in Jan-\nuary 2021 assessing the railway\u2019s transportation merits.  \nId. at 191a.  The Board found, subject to the completion \nof the environmental review, that the railway met the \nstandards for an exemption under Section 10502 of the \nInterstate Commerce Act.  Ibid. \nMeanwhile, the Board performed an environmental \nanalysis under NEPA, issuing a draft environmental \nimpact statement in October 2020, and a final statement \nin August 2021.  Pet. App. 10a.  In addition, to comply \nwith the Endangered Species Act of 1973, 16 U.S.C. \n1531 et seq., the Board consulted with the Fish and \nWildlife Service (Service) regarding the effect of the \nnew railway on endangered species, and the Service is-\nsued a final biological opinion in September 2021.  Pet. \nApp. 11a.  Several months later, the Board issued its fi-\nnal exemption decision, which authorized construction \nand operation of the railway subject to environmental \nmitigation conditions.  Id. at 74a-189a. \n3. Eagle County, Colorado and several environmen-\ntal organizations filed two petitions for review\u2014which \nthe court of appeals consolidated\u2014challenging the \n\n5 \n \nBoard\u2019s preliminary and final exemption decisions, as \nwell as the Service\u2019s biological opinion.  See Pet. App. \n13a.   \nThe court of appeals granted the petitions in part \nand denied them in part.  Pet. App. 1a-71a.  The court \nconcluded that Eagle County and the environmental or-\nganizations had standing to challenge both the Board\u2019s \ndecisions and the Service\u2019s biological opinion.  Id. at \n14a-22a.  The court also held that it had subject-matter \njurisdiction to review the Board\u2019s decisions under the \nHobbs Act.  Id. at 22a-23a.  And the court held that it \nhad jurisdiction to review the Service\u2019s biological opin-\nion because the Board had relied on and incorporated \nthe opinion into its final exemption decision, and the \nBoard\u2019s decisions are subject to review exclusively in \nthe courts of appeals.  Id. at 23a.  The court then re-\nsolved numerous challenges to the merits of the federal \nagency actions in connection with the railway authori-\nzation.  Id. at 25a-69a.   \na. As most relevant here, the court of appeals held \nthat the Board\u2019s NEPA analysis should have considered \nthe upstream environmental effects of increased oil de-\nvelopment and the downstream effects of refining that \noil.  Pet. App. 30a-37a.  The court explained that the \nBoard had offered two primary reasons for excluding \nthose effects, and neither was sufficient to justify the \nagency\u2019s decision.  Id. at 30a-31a.   \nFirst, the court of appeals rejected the Board\u2019s con-\ntention that, because of the agency\u2019s \u201c\u200a\u2018lack of infor-\nmation about the\u2019 location of future oil production sites\u201d \nand the \u201c\u200a\u2018destination and end use of the [oil],\u2019\u200a\u201d the up-\nstream and downstream effects were not \u201c\u200a\u2018reasonably \nforeseeable impacts\u2019\u201d that the Board was required to \nconsider.  Pet. App. 30a, 32a (citations omitted; brackets \n\n6 \n \nin original).  The court found that the Board had \n\u201cfail[ed] to adequately explain why it could not employ \n\u2018some degree of forecasting\u2019 to identify the aforemen-\ntioned upstream and downstream impacts.\u201d  Id. at 35a \n(citation omitted).   \nSecond, the court of appeals rejected the Board\u2019s \ncontention that, under this Court\u2019s decision in Public \nCitizen, supra, it was not required to \u201cidentify and de-\nscribe the environmental effects of increased oil drilling \nand refining\u201d because the agency \u201clack[ed] the author-\nity to prevent, control, or mitigate those developments.\u201d  \nPet. App. 36a.  In the court\u2019s view, the Board had the \nauthority to prevent those effects, observing that the \nBoard had \u201cexclusive jurisdiction over the construction \nand operation of the railway, including authority to \ndeny the exemption petition if the environmental harm \ncaused by the railway outweighs its transportation ben-\nefits.\u201d  Ibid. (citing 49 U.S.C. 10501(c) and 10901(b)).  \nThe court also reasoned that the Board \u201cis authorized \nto license railroad construction and operation based on \nthe \u2018public convenience and necessity,\u2019\u200a\u201d which, the court \nconcluded, \u201cencompasses reasonably foreseeable envi-\nronmental harms.\u201d  Id. at 37a (citation omitted).  Based \non this analysis of the Board\u2019s \u201cauthority to deny an ex-\nemption to a railway project on the ground that the rail-\nway\u2019s anticipated environmental and other costs out-\nweigh its expected benefits,\u201d the court found that \u201cthe \nBoard\u2019s argument that it need not consider effects it \ncannot prevent\u201d was \u201csimply inapplicable.\u201d  Ibid.   \nb. The court of appeals also identified several other \nflaws in the Board\u2019s NEPA analysis, including its fail-\nure to take a hard look at the increased risk of rail acci-\ndents downline, Pet. App. 40a-42a, the risk and impacts \nof wildfires downline, id. at 42a-45a, and the railway\u2019s \n\n7 \n \nimpacts on water resources downline on the Colorado \nRiver, id. at 46a-47a.  In addition, the court rejected or \ndeclined to reach multiple other challenges under \nNEPA and the National Historic Preservation Act, 54 \nU.S.C. 304108.  Pet. App. 29a, 37a-39a, 47a-50a, 55a-57a.  \nThe court also found flaws in the Service\u2019s biological \nopinion, Id. at 50a-55a, and in the Board\u2019s exemption de-\ncision under the Interstate Commerce Act, Pet. App. \n57a-69a.   \nBased on the errors in the NEPA analysis and the \nbiological opinion, the \u201cfail[ure] to conduct a reasoned \napplication\u201d of the Interstate Commerce Act, and the \nBoard\u2019s \u201cfail[ure] to weigh the [railway\u2019s] uncertain fi-\nnancial viability and the full potential for environmental \nharm against the transportation benefits it identified,\u201d \nthe court of appeals vacated the exemption order as ar-\nbitrary and capricious, and partially vacated the under-\nlying NEPA assessment and biological opinion.  Pet. \nApp. 70a; see id. at 70a-71a.   \n4. Petitioners sought rehearing en banc.  The court \nof appeals denied the petition, with no judge calling for \na vote.  Pet. App. 72a\u201373a. \nARGUMENT \nPetitioners contend (Pet. 14-21) that this Court \nshould grant the petition for a writ of certiorari to re-\nsolve a disagreement in the circuits regarding the \nproper application of this Court\u2019s decision in Depart-\nment of Transp. v. Public Citizen, 541 U.S. 752 (2004).  \nThis Court\u2019s review is unwarranted because there is no \ncircuit conflict regarding the proper application of Pub-\nlic Citizen\u2019s holding that NEPA does not require an \nagency to analyze environmental effects when the \nagency \u201chas no ability to prevent\u201d those effects \u201cdue to \nits limited statutory authority.\u201d  Id. at 770.  What \n\n8 \n \npetitioners describe as differences in the courts of ap-\npeals\u2019 understanding of Public Citizen are more appro-\npriately attributed to variations in the statutory and \nregulatory authority wielded by different agencies in \ndifferent contexts.  And even if this Court were of the \nview that the question presented might warrant review \nat some point, this case would be a poor vehicle because, \namong other things, the government recently issued \nnew regulations regarding the appropriate scope of \nNEPA review, and because the court of appeals identi-\nfied several other flaws in the agency\u2019s NEPA analysis \nthat will require a revised environmental impact state-\nment regardless of the outcome of this case.  The peti-\ntion for a writ of certiorari should therefore be denied.    \n1. The courts of appeals uniformly recognize that, \nunder Public Citizen, an agency need not consider en-\nvironmental consequences it lacks the statutory and \nregulatory authority to prevent.     \na. In Public Citizen, the Court considered whether \nan agency had reasonably excluded certain environmen-\ntal effects from its NEPA analysis based on the \nagency\u2019s limited statutory mandate.  541 U.S. at 767.  \nThe case involved a NEPA challenge to safety regula-\ntions for Mexican tractor-trailer trucks that the Federal \nMotor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) prom-\nulgated after the President agreed to lift a moratorium \non the entry of Mexican trucks into the United States.  \nId. at 756, 760-761.  The agency\u2019s NEPA analysis con-\nsidered the environmental consequences of the roadside \ninspections required by its new safety rules.  But the \nanalysis did not consider the consequences of the in-\ncreased presence of Mexican trucks in the United \nStates because FMCSA determined that the increased \npresence was due to the President\u2019s decision to lift the \n\n9 \n \nmoratorium, rather than the agency\u2019s new regulations.  \nId. at 761.  Several challengers asserted that limiting \nthe NEPA analysis in that way was improper because \nthe trucks\u2019 presence should be considered an effect of \nthe regulations, on the theory that no Mexican truck \ncould operate in the United States without obtaining a \ncertification from FMCSA, and FMCSA could not issue \nany certifications for Mexican trucks until it promul-\ngated the safety rules.  Id. at 765-766.   \nThis Court rejected the challenge, finding that the \nscope of the agency\u2019s NEPA analysis was appropriate \nbecause the agency\u2019s governing statutes prevented it \nfrom barring Mexican trucks based on the environmen-\ntal effects of their entry.  Public Citizen, 541 U.S. at \n765; see id. at 767-770.  The Court explained that, while \nFMCSA was required to ensure the safety and financial \nresponsibility of the trucks operating within the United \nStates, it had no \u201cability to countermand the President\u2019s \nlifting of the moratorium or otherwise categorically to \nexclude Mexican motor carriers from operating in the \nUnited States.\u201d  Id. at 766.  To the contrary, the Court \nexplained, it would \u201cviolate\u201d the agency\u2019s statutory \nmandate for FMCSA to refuse to authorize a Mexican \nmotor carrier that was \u201cwilling and able to comply with \nthe various substantive requirements for safety and fi-\nnancial responsibility.\u201d  Ibid.  \nThe Court declined to adopt the challengers\u2019 \u201cpartic-\nularly unyielding variation of \u2018but for\u2019 causation, where \nan agency\u2019s action is considered a cause of an environ-\nmental effect even when the agency has no authority to \nprevent the effect.\u201d  Public Citizen, 541 U.S. at 767.  \nThe Court explained that the challengers\u2019 theory con-\nflicted with its prior decision in Metropolitan Edison \nCo. v. People Against Nuclear Energy, 460 U.S. 766 \n\n10 \n \n(1983), which had drawn an analogy to the doctrine of \nproximate cause under tort law and encouraged courts \nto look to NEPA\u2019s \u201cunderlying policies\u201d to draw \u201ca man-\nageable line between those causal changes that may \nmake\u201d an agency responsible for an effect under NEPA \n\u201cand those that do not.\u2019\u201d  Public Citizen, 541 U.S. at 767 \n(quoting Metropolitan Edison, 460 U.S. at 774 n.7).  The \nCourt also relied on the \u201crule of reason\u201d that is \u201cinher-\nent in NEPA and its implementing regulations,\u201d ob-\nserving that \u201cno rule of reason worthy of that title would \nrequire an agency\u201d to analyze environmental effects \nwhen the results of that analysis \u201cwould serve \u2018no pur-\npose.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Ibid. (citation omitted).    \nBased on Metropolitan Edison and the rule of rea-\nson, the Court held that \u201cwhere an agency has no ability \nto prevent a particular effect due to its limited statutory \nauthority over the relevant actions, the agency cannot \nbe considered a legally relevant \u2018cause\u2019 of that effect.\u201d  \nPublic Citizen, 541 U.S. at 770.  And because FMSCA \n\u201csimply lack[ed] the power to act on\u201d the information \nthat would have been produced by an analysis of the en-\nvironmental consequences of permitting Mexican \ntrucks to enter the United States, the Court found that \nthe agency had acted reasonably in excluding the con-\nsideration of those effects from its NEPA analysis.  Id. \nat 768.  \nb. The courts of appeals have relied on Public Citi-\nzen\u2019s holding to affirm the reasonableness of an \nagency\u2019s decision to exclude a particular environmental \neffect from its NEPA analysis where\u2014under the gov-\nerning statutory and regulatory scheme\u2014the agency \nhad \u201cno ability to prevent\u201d that effect.  541 U.S. at 770.  \nIn Center for Biological Diversity v. U.S. Army Corps \nof Engineers, 941 F.3d 1288 (2019), for example, the \n\n11 \n \nEleventh Circuit held that the Army Corps of Engi-\nneers\u2019 decision not to consider certain environmental ef-\nfects in issuing a discharge permit under the Clean Wa-\nter Act was consistent with Public Citizen because the \nCorps could not have \u201chinge[d] its permitting decision\u201d \non the relevant effects without \u201cignoring the Clean Wa-\nter Act\u2019s text and misapplying its implementing regula-\ntions.\u201d  Id. at 1298.   \nSimilarly, in Ohio Valley Environmental Coalition \nv. Aracoma Coal Co., 556 F.3d 177 (2009), cert denied, \n561 U.S. 1051 (2010), the Fourth Circuit determined \nthat, under Public Citizen, the Corps was not required \nto consider the environmental effects of coal mining op-\nerations as a whole in issuing a permit for certain \ndredge and fill activities because the governing regula-\ntions assigned the \u201ccontrol and responsibility\u201d for the \nmining operations to a different agency.  Id. at 196-197.  \nAnd in Kentuckians for the Commonwealth v. United \nStates Army Corps of Engineers, 746 F.3d 698 (2014), \nthe Sixth Circuit found that Public Citizen supported \nthe Corps\u2019 determination that it did not need to consider \nthe health effects of a mining project as a whole in issu-\ning a specific permit because the agency had deter-\nmined that it lacked \u201c\u200a\u2018sufficient control and responsibil-\nity\u2019 over the whole project\u201d under the \u201ccomplete regu-\nlatory scheme.\u201d  Id. at 710 (citation omitted).   \nCourts have also cited the limited statutory and reg-\nulatory authority of other agencies in upholding the rea-\nsonableness of limits those agencies have placed on \ntheir NEPA analyses.  Thus, in New Jersey Department \nof Environmental Protection v. United States Nuclear \nRegulatory Commission, 561 F.3d 132 (2009), the Third \nCircuit determined that the Nuclear Regulatory Com-\nmission\u2019s lack of \u201cauthority over the airspace above its \n\n12 \n \nfacilities\u201d supported the agency\u2019s determination that it \ndid not need to consider the environmental effects of an \nair attack on a nuclear facility.  Id. at 139; see id. at 140 \n(explaining that the agency\u2019s \u201clack of control over air-\nspace supports our holding\u201d); see also Protect Our \nParks, Inc. v. Buttigieg, 39 F.4th 389, 393, 400 (7th Cir. \n2022) (citing Public Citizen in holding that a federal \nagency was not required to consider a potential regula-\ntory option it lacked any authority to undertake).   \nThe D.C. Circuit, too, has recognized that an \nagency\u2019s governing statutory and regulatory frame-\nwork may limit the scope of its NEPA obligations.  In \nSierra Club v. FERC, 827 F.3d 36 (2016) (Freeport), the \nD.C. Circuit held that the Federal Energy Regulatory \nCommission (FERC) was not required \u201cto address the \nindirect effects of the anticipated export of natural gas\u201d \nas part of its NEPA analysis of the authorization of new \nnatural gas facilities because \u201cthe Department of En-\nergy, not the Commission, has sole authority to license \nthe export of any natural gas going through the [new] \nfacilities.\u201d  Id. at 47 (emphasis omitted).  The court ex-\nplained that \u201c[i]n the specific circumstances where, as \nhere, an agency \u2018has no ability to prevent a certain ef-\nfect due to\u2019 that agency\u2019s \u2018limited statutory authority \nover the relevant action,\u2019\u200a\u201d the agency need not consider \nthat effect.  Ibid. (quoting Public Citizen, 541 U.S. at \n771).   \nThe D.C. Circuit reached the same conclusion in two \nother cases involving challenges to FERC\u2019s decision to \nexclude the environmental effects of the export of natu-\nral gas from its NEPA analyses.  Sierra Club v. FERC, \n827 F.3d 59 (2016) (Sabine Pass); EarthReports, Inc. v. \nFERC, 828 F.3d 949 (2016).  And in a fourth case, Sierra \nClub v. FERC, 867 F.3d 1357 (D.C. Cir. 2017) (Sabal \n\n13 \n \nTrail), the court of appeals applied the same principles, \nbut found that Public Citizen did not support FERC\u2019s \ndecision to exclude certain adverse environmental ef-\nfects from its NEPA analysis of the propriety of issuing \na pipeline certificate because of differences in the gov-\nerning statute.  Id. at 1372-1373.  The court explained \nthat, in the first three cases, FERC could not have con-\nsidered the environmental effects of natural gas exports \n\u201cwhen regulating in its proper sphere.\u201d  Ibid.  But the \ncourt determined that in Sabal Trail, the agency was \nacting under a different and broader grant of statutory \nauthority that instructed the agency to consider \u201cthe \npublic convenience and necessity.\u201d  Ibid. (citation omit-\nted).  The court found that, under that distinct provi-\nsion, the agency was permitted to \u201cdeny a pipeline cer-\ntificate on the ground that the pipeline would be too \nharmful to the environment.\u201d  Ibid.  \u201cPublic Citizen \nthus did not excuse FERC from considering these indi-\nrect effects.\u201d   Ibid. \nc. The court of appeals acted in accordance with \nthose decisions in this case when it determined that, be-\ncause of the scope of the Surface Transportation \nBoard\u2019s statutory and regulatory authority, the Board \ncould not rely on Public Citizen as a basis for not con-\nsidering the environmental effects of increased oil drill-\ning and refining in its NEPA analysis.  Pet. App. 36a.  \nThe court did not dispute the principle that an agency \nneed not consider the environmental effects of develop-\nments that it \u201clacks authority to prevent, control, or \nmitigate.\u201d  Ibid.  The court instead found that principle \n\u201csimply inapplicable\u201d in light of the Board\u2019s statutory \nand regulatory authority.  Id. at 37a.  In the court\u2019s \nview, the governing framework\u2014including the Board\u2019s \nstatutory mandate \u201cto license railroad construction and \n\n14 \n \noperation based on the \u2018public convenience and neces-\nsity\u2019\u200a\u201d\u2014gave the Board \u201cthe authority to deny an  \nexemption to a railway project on the ground that the \nrailway\u2019s anticipated environmental and other costs \noutweigh its expected benefits.\u201d  Ibid. (citation omit-\nted). \n2. Petitioners are therefore mistaken in asserting \n(Pet. 20) that there is a \u201csharp split between the D.C. \nCircuit\u2019s reading of Public Citizen and the reading em-\nployed by the Third, Fourth, Sixth, Seventh, and Elev-\nenth Circuits.\u201d  All of those courts recognize that, be-\ncause Public Citizen held that an agency need not con-\nsider environmental effects it cannot prevent, the scope \nof the requisite NEPA analysis will depend on the scope \nof the particular agency\u2019s statutory and regulatory au-\nthority.  And while the D.C. Circuit has sometimes \nfound that Public Citizen does not excuse an agency\u2019s \nfailure to consider certain environmental effects, it has \ndone so based on its understanding of the breadth of the \nagency\u2019s authority in the particular case, not a disagree-\nment regarding Public Citizen\u2019s holding.   \nPetitioners\u2019 assertion to the contrary is based pri-\nmarily (Pet. 18-19) on the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s criticism of \nthe D.C. Circuit\u2019s decision in Sabal Trail, but that crit-\nicism does not establish an inter-circuit conflict because \nthe Eleventh Circuit described Sabal Trail as \u201cat odds \nwith earlier D.C. Circuit cases correctly\u201d recognizing \nthe limits on the environmental analysis NEPA re-\nquires.  Center For Biological Diversity, 941 F.3d at \n1300.  Therefore, at most, the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s criti-\ncism suggests an intra-circuit conflict that would not \nwarrant this Court\u2019s intervention.  Wisniewski v. \nUnited States, 353 U.S. 901, 902 (1957) (per curiam) (\u201cIt \n\n15 \n \nis primarily the task of a Court of Appeals to reconcile \nits internal difficulties.\u201d).   \nIn any event, while the Eleventh Circuit criticized \nSabal Trail for \u201cfail[ing] to take seriously the rule of \nreason announced in Public Citizen,\u201d in the very next \nparagraph, the Eleventh Circuit described that \u201crule of \nreason\u201d as dictating that \u201cagencies are not required to \nconsider effects that they lack the statutory authority \ncategorically to prevent.\u201d  Center for Biological Diver-\nsity, 941 F.3d at 1300.  Neither Sabal Trail nor the de-\ncision below purported to reject that principle.  Instead, \nboth held that\u2014because the governing statutory provi-\nsions gave the agency the authority to consider and dis-\napprove the relevant project based on the increased \nharm to the environment that the project would cause\u2014\nthe agency had the statutory authority to prevent that \nincreased harm.  See Sabal Trail, 867 F.3d at 1373; Pet. \nApp. 37a.   \nPetitioners err in contending (Pet. 20) that differ-\nences in the governing statutory and regulatory frame-\nwork \u201ccannot account for the circuits\u2019 conflicting inter-\npretations\u201d because the Corps of Engineers in the other \ndecisions had \u201cjust as much power\u201d as the agencies in \nSabal Trail and the decision below.  The Eleventh Cir-\ncuit itself held otherwise, recognizing that Sabal Trail \nwas distinguishable from its own decision in Center for \nBiological Diversity because, among other things, \u201cthe \nagency\u2019s statutory authority in Sabal Trail was much \nbroader than the Corps\u2019 here.\u201d  941 F.3d at 1299.   \nPetitioners also err in asserting (Pet. 19) that the \nNinth Circuit\u2019s decision in Center for Biological Diver-\nsity v. Bernhardt, 982 F.3d 723 (2020), suggests disa-\ngreement in the circuits regarding Public Citizen\u2019s \nmeaning.  The main NEPA challenge in that case \n\n16 \n \ninvolved whether it was technically feasible for the \nagency to quantify emissions resulting from the foreign \nconsumption of oil.  Id. at 737-740.  The court cited and \ndescribed the D.C. Circuit\u2019s decision in Sabal Trail in \njustifying its conclusion that an agency may not excuse \nits failure to assess the environmental effects of \u201cindi-\nrect greenhouse gas emissions\u201d based on the agency\u2019s \nneed to make \u201cassumptions\u201d in order to estimate those \neffects.  Id. at 737.  The Ninth Circuit did not discuss \neither Public Citizen or Sabal Trail\u2019s treatment of that \ncase, mentioning Public Citizen only in a \u201ccf.\u201d cite to a \nsentence stating that the agency \u201cha[d] the statutory \nauthority to act on the emissions resulting from foreign \noil consumption.\u201d  Id. at 740.   \n3. Petitioners\u2019 other arguments in support of review \nlack merit, and this case would be a poor vehicle even if \nthe Court was inclined to consider the question pre-\nsented.   \na. Petitioners contend (Pet. 21-23) that the decision \nbelow warrants this Court\u2019s intervention because the \nD.C. Circuit\u2019s approach to Public Citizen turns agen-\ncies into \u201cenvironmental-policy czars.\u201d  Pet. 22 (citation \nand emphasis omitted).  But the decision below merely \nfound that the Board had the statutory authority to con-\nsider the environmental effects of increased oil drilling \nand refining, Pet. App. 36a, and remanded to the Board \nso that it could either analyze those effects or \u201cexplain \nin more detail\u201d why it could not identify and quantify \nthem, Id. at 34a (citation omitted); see id. at 35a (hold-\ning that the Board had not \u201cadequately explain[ed] why \nit could not employ\u201d forecasting and other methods to \nestimate those effects).  The decision therefore does not \nrequire the Board to refuse to authorize the railway \nbased on the environmental effects of increased oil \n\n17 \n \ndrilling and refining, and it does not even require the \nBoard to consider those effects if it can adequately ex-\nplain why their consideration is not feasible.   \nMoreover, petitioners do not challenge the court of \nappeals\u2019 understanding of the Board\u2019s statutory author-\nity to deny an exemption based on the relevant environ-\nmental effects.  Rather, petitioners state that the court \n\u201cwas right\u201d to find \u201cthat the Board could decline the \nproject \u2018if the environmental harm caused by the rail-\nway outweigh[ed] its transportation benefits.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Pet. 23 \n(quoting Pet. App. 36a) (brackets in original).  And pe-\ntitioners do not contend that there is any disagreement \nin the courts of appeals regarding that conclusion. \nb. Petitioners also assert (Pet. 24-25) that the Court \nshould grant review because in 2022 the Council on En-\nvironmental Quality (CEQ) issued regulations address-\ning the appropriate scope of NEPA review.  See 87 Fed. \nReg. 23,453 (Apr. 20, 2022).  Petitioners maintain (Pet. \n24) that the Federal Register notice accompanying the \n2022 rules contains an analysis of Public Citizen that \ndiffers from that reflected in the CEQ\u2019s 2020 regula-\ntions, 85 Fed. Reg. 43,304 (July 16, 2020).  The court of \nappeals\u2019 decision, however, does not analyze or discuss \neither the 2022 or 2020 regulations, because the Board\u2019s \nNEPA analysis was performed \u201cunder pre-2020 regula-\ntions.\u201d  Pet. App. 26a.  And those intervening regulatory \ndevelopments, as well as a further set of relevant regu-\nlations released by the CEQ earlier this month, 89 Fed. \nReg. 35,442 (May 1, 2024), provide an additional reason \nto deny certiorari, because the circuits have not yet had \nan opportunity to assess whether or how the new regu-\nlations may affect their approach.   \nc. This case would also be a poor vehicle for review \nbecause the holding that is the subject of this petition \n\n18 \n \nwas just one of several independent holdings adverse to \nthe Board and the federal government.  In assessing the \nBoard\u2019s NEPA compliance, the court of appeals also \nheld that the Board had failed to adequately analyze \nthree other environmental effects (downline rail acci-\ndents, risks and impacts of wildfires, and impacts on wa-\nter resources).  Pet. App. 40a-47a.  Those holdings \nwould not be affected by the resolution of the question \npresented, and the same is true with respect to the \ncourt\u2019s holdings regarding the flaws in the Fish and \nWildlife Service\u2019s biological opinion, and some of the de-\nfects the court identified in the Board\u2019s application of \nthe Interstate Commerce Act.  See id. at 57a-69a.  Be-\ncause of these additional deficiencies, id. at 70a, the \nBoard and the Fish and Wildlife Service would be re-\nquired to issue revised decisions regardless of the out-\ncome of this petition.   \nd. Finally, this case would be an unsuitable vehicle \nbecause petitioners did not challenge the D.C. Circuit\u2019s \nunderstanding of Public Citizen before the court of ap-\npeals.  While the Board relied on Public Citizen in ex-\nplaining the scope of its NEPA analysis, Pet. App. 135a, \npetitioners did not discuss or even cite that case in their \npanel briefing.  See C.A. Doc. 1990837 (Mar. 20, 2023).  \nAnd their petition for rehearing en banc likewise did not \ndiscuss Public Citizen or suggest that the panel\u2019s un-\nderstanding of that decision implicated or created a di-\nvision in the circuits.  See C.A. Doc. 2019520 (Sept. 29, \n2023).  Instead, petitioners argued that the panel\u2019s \nNEPA analysis conflicted with other D.C. Circuit deci-\nsions.  See id. at 9-13.  Accordingly, the court of appeals \ndid not have an opportunity to consider petitioners\u2019 ar-\nguments regarding the proper application of Public Cit-\nizen, and this Court should not do so in the first \n\n19 \n \ninstance.  Cf. Byrd v. United States, 584 U.S. 395, 404 \n(2018) (observing that \u201cit is generally unwise\u201d for this \nCourt \u201cto consider arguments in the first instance\u201d).   \nCONCLUSION \nThe petition for a writ of certiorari should be denied.  \nRespectfully submitted. \n \n \nELIZABETH B.

          "task_beliefs": "My model of this case has evolved from a simple binary conflict to a more complex, three-sided legal negotiation. The introduction of the Solicitor General's (SG) reply brief has clarified the government's position, revealing it as a distinct, mediating stance between the petitioners and respondents.\n\n1.  **The Three Competing Frameworks:** The central dispute is no longer a simple dialectic but a triangular contest over the correct standard for NEPA's scope:\n    *   **Petitioners' Framework (Hard Limit):** NEPA analysis is strictly limited by common-law \"proximate causation\" and an agency's direct regulatory authority. This is a bright-line rule.\n    *   **Respondent's Framework (Broad Mandate):** NEPA analysis is governed by a \"reasonable foreseeability\" standard, where foreseeability is the primary, if not sole, limiting principle.\n    *   **Solicitor General's Framework (Flexible Standard):** This is a \"middle way.\" The SG agrees with the respondents that a strict tort-law proximate cause standard is wrong (*Metropolitan Edison* rejected it). However, the SG agrees with the petitioners that \"reasonable foreseeability\" is not the *only* limit. The SG advocates for a flexible, deferential standard where agencies can draw \"manageable, context-specific lines\" based on a \"rule of reason.\" This standard allows an agency to exclude effects that are too attenuated, speculative, or not useful to its decision-making process, even if factually foreseeable.\n\n2.  **The SG's Strategic Positioning:** The SG's reply brief is a masterclass in strategic positioning. While formally \"supporting petitioners,\" the SG explicitly distances the government from their core legal test, stating, **\"Petitioners err to the extent they endorse bright-line rules that find no footing in NEPA\u2019s text,\"** specifically rejecting the importation of tort-law proximate cause. This move provides the Court with a \"Goldilocks\" option\u2014a standard that is neither as restrictive as the petitioners' nor as expansive as the respondents'.\n\n3.  **The Battle Over the \"Off-Ramp\":** The respondents' strategy of offering a narrow, fact-based \"off-ramp\" (arguing the STB's analysis was \"utterly unreasoned\") has been directly challenged. The SG's brief urges the Court to decide the main legal question and \"decline petitioners\u2019 request to reach beyond the question presented.\" This signals that the U.S. government, as the primary entity bound by NEPA, has a strong interest in obtaining a clear, nationwide ruling on the scope of environmental review, rather than a punt on case-specific facts. This increases the likelihood of a broad, precedential decision.\n\n4.  **The Fiscal Responsibility Act as a Contested Weapon:** The SG's brief counters the respondents' narrative that the Act's codification of \"reasonably foreseeable\" endorsed their broad view. The SG argues that the Act was intended to *streamline* and *limit* NEPA burdens (citing new page limits), making it illogical to assume Congress simultaneously intended to dramatically expand the scope of required analysis. This reframes the legislation as supporting a more constrained, manageable approach.\n\n5.  **Refined Uncertainty and Next Evidentiary Target (New):** My internal reflection has clarified that while the SG's brief provided a likely path for the Court, it also created a new, critical uncertainty. The most important unknown is now: **How do the petitioners (Seven County Infrastructure Coalition) react to the SG publicly disagreeing with their core legal test?** Their own reply brief is the key piece of evidence needed to answer this. If they pivot and align with the SG's more moderate \"rule of reason,\" it would be a very strong signal that this \"middle way\" will form the basis of the Court's majority opinion. If they double down on their original, rigid proximate cause standard, it signals a fractured argument on the petitioner's side, which could complicate the path to a simple reversal.\n\n**Updated Prediction:** My prediction remains a **moderate-to-high confidence in reversal, but on the Solicitor General's terms.** The SG has provided the Court with a well-reasoned, practical, and deferential standard that avoids the extremes of both parties. The most probable outcome is an opinion that reverses the D.C. Circuit, vacates the judgment, and remands, while articulating a new standard for NEPA scope that closely mirrors the \"rule of reason\" and \"manageable lines\" framework advocated by the Solicitor General. The petitioner's reply brief is the key to confirming or disconfirming this hypothesis.",
          "design_beliefs": "This observation has significantly refined my analytical heuristics, particularly concerning the role of reply briefs and the strategic positioning of key parties like the Solicitor General.\n\n1.  **Foundational Beliefs (Stable):** The core strategies of **categorizing the legal question** and **analyzing primary source documents** remain essential.\n\n2.  **Information Retrieval Strategy (Refined):** The **\"Reflect-Adapt-Retry\" cycle** for information gathering continues to be effective and has now been demonstrated in practice. A failed search for the petitioner's reply brief (which returned the SG's brief) prompted a reflection on the ambiguity of the search query.\n    *   **(New Heuristic):** When searching for documents that may be filed by multiple parties (e.g., reply briefs, amicus briefs), use specific disambiguating information in the query. For example, use `field_filters` to specify the author or party name to ensure the correct document is retrieved and to avoid analyzing redundant information.\n\n3.  **Source Prioritization (Refined Heuristic):** The \"trio\" of Petitioner, Respondent, and SG briefs is the core. However, this is now expanded: **\"Always obtain and analyze the Reply Briefs, especially the SG's.\"** The reply brief is not redundant; it is where a party sharpens its arguments, makes critical concessions, and, crucially, distinguishes its position from its allies. The current situation highlights the need to obtain the reply briefs from *all* major parties to see how they react to each other's final arguments.\n\n4.  **Predictive Signals (Stable & Refined):**\n    *   **\"Always determine the position of the Solicitor General.\"** (Stable)\n    *   **\"Identify the key contested precedent.\"** (Stable)\n\n5.  **Argument Analysis (Validated & New Heuristics):**\n    *   **\"Actively seek out and model the counterargument.\" (Validated)** This remains a non-negotiable principle for robust analysis.\n    *   **\"Look for 'off-ramps' and identify who is trying to close them.\" (Refined)** It's not enough to spot a narrow exit. Identifying which party (here, the SG) is actively arguing *against* that exit is a powerful signal about the stakes and what the most sophisticated actors want from the case (i.e., a clear rule).\n    *   **\"Analyze how all parties frame recent legislative action.\" (Validated)** The SG's use of the Fiscal Responsibility Act's streamlining purpose to counter the respondents' textual argument is a perfect example of this principle in action.\n    *   **\"Identify procedural gambits.\"** (Stable)\n    *   **(New) \"Identify the 'Goldilocks' position.\"** In complex administrative or statutory cases, the SG often carves out a middle-ground standard that is more moderate than the primary litigants. This \"just right\" position is often designed to be adopted by the Court as a workable standard that preserves executive branch flexibility. Finding this \"third way\" is a key predictive task.\n    *   **(New) \"Pay close attention when a party critiques its own 'side'.\"** When a supporting party, especially the SG, explicitly disagrees with the main petitioner's legal test (e.g., \"Petitioners err...\"), it is a critical signal. It highlights a perceived weakness in the original argument and reveals the contours of a more defensible, moderate position that is likely to attract a majority of the Court.\n\n6.  **Process Methodology (Validated):** The **\"Integrate-Reflect-Plan\" cycle** is working well. Having integrated the respondent's brief and the SG's reply, the \"Reflect\" step (the `THINK` action) successfully identified the next critical piece of evidence (the petitioner's reply brief) and formulated a \"Plan\" to acquire it with a more precise methodology. This demonstrates the value of metacognitive pauses to refine strategy and focus information gathering."

My current model has identified a critical uncertainty: how the petitioners react to the Solicitor General's 'middle way' proposal. The petitioner's reply brief is the only document that can resolve this. \n\nTask EIG is very high (0.9) because finding this brief will directly answer the most pressing question. If the petitioners embrace the SG's standard, my confidence in a reversal on those terms will become near-certain. If they reject it, it reveals a crucial fracture on their side, which is also highly informative for predicting the final vote coalition and reasoning. The potential for a significant update to my posterior belief about the outcome is immense.\n\nDesign EIG is high (0.7) because this action is a direct test of my newly refined 'Source Prioritization' and 'Merits-Stage Trilogy' heuristics. My entire 'Integrate-Reflect-Plan' cycle has led to this precise, targeted search. Success will strongly validate this systematic approach to evidence gathering. Failure would force a valuable refinement of my information retrieval strategies, particularly concerning query formulation when a document is known to exist but is hard to find. \n\nThe joint EIG is therefore extremely high, as the action perfectly aligns a critical task-level need with a direct test of my evolving design methodology.",

          "task_beliefs": "My understanding of this case has deepened significantly, moving from a three-party negotiation on the merits to a more dynamic model that includes the case's procedural history and the strategic evolution of the key players. The failed search for the petitioner's reply brief paradoxically provided crucial context by unearthing the Solicitor General's earlier brief opposing certiorari.\n\n1.  **The SG's Strategic Journey (New):** My model now incorporates the Solicitor General's evolving position. Initially, at the certiorari stage, the SG *opposed* the Supreme Court hearing this case. The newly discovered \"Brief in Opposition\" shows the government argued that review was \"unwarranted,\" that there was no circuit conflict, and that the case was a \"poor vehicle.\" However, the Court granted certiorari *despite* this opposition. This indicates a strong desire by at least four justices to rule on this question. Subsequently, at the merits stage, the SG's office pivoted. Having lost the battle over whether to hear the case, they are now focused on shaping the outcome, filing a brief (the one I previously analyzed) that formally supports the petitioners' request for reversal but provides a different, more moderate legal standard for the Court to adopt.\n\n2.  **The Three Competing Frameworks (Stable, with Deeper Context):** The triangular contest over the NEPA standard remains the core of the case, but the SG's role is now clearer.\n    *   **Petitioners' Framework (Hard Limit):** Proximate causation and direct regulatory authority as a bright-line rule.\n    *   **Respondent's Framework (Broad Mandate):** \"Reasonable foreseeability\" as the primary limiting principle.\n    *   **Solicitor General's Framework (Pragmatic \"Middle Way\"):** A flexible, deferential \"rule of reason\" standard. The SG's journey from opposing cert to offering this middle ground frames this position as a pragmatic intervention\u2014an attempt to guide the Court to a workable standard now that it is committed to deciding the issue, and to prevent it from adopting the petitioners' more extreme test.\n\n3.  **The Battle Over the \"Off-Ramp\" (Stable):** My belief that the SG is actively trying to close the narrow, fact-based \"off-ramp\" is reinforced. The SG's initial opposition to cert suggests they didn't see this as a clean case. Now that the Court is involved, the SG has a strong incentive to get a clear, nationwide rule that preserves executive branch flexibility, rather than a messy, fact-bound remand or a ruling based on the petitioners' rigid standard.\n\n4.  **The Fiscal Responsibility Act (Stable):** The SG's argument that the Act's streamlining purpose contradicts the respondents' expansive reading of \"reasonably foreseeable\" remains a key piece of evidence supporting a more constrained interpretation of NEPA's scope.\n\n5.  **Refined Uncertainty and Next Evidentiary Target (Reinforced):** The failure to find the petitioner's reply brief, combined with the discovery of the SG's earlier opposition, makes the petitioner's reaction even more critical. The central question remains: **How do the petitioners (Seven County) react to the SG's journey from cert-stage opponent to merits-stage conditional ally?** Do they embrace the SG's moderate \"rule of reason\" as their best path to victory, or do they double down on their original, rigid proximate cause standard, thereby highlighting the fracture on their own side? Finding their final reply brief is the highest priority.\n\n**Updated Prediction:** My prediction remains a **high confidence in reversal, specifically on the Solicitor General's terms.** The discovery of the SG's initial opposition strengthens this prediction. The Court, having taken the case against the SG's advice, is now faced with a choice. The SG's \"middle way\" offers them a well-reasoned, deferential, and institutionally-defensible standard, presented by the government's own expert litigator. It appears to be the most plausible path for building a majority coalition, as it avoids the extremes offered by the primary litigants.",
          "design_beliefs": "This observation was a powerful lesson in the value of failed searches and the importance of modeling a case's full procedural history. My meta-level heuristics for legal analysis have been significantly refined.\n\n1.  **Foundational Beliefs (Stable):** **Categorizing the legal question** and **analyzing primary source documents** remain the bedrock of my methodology.\n\n2.  **Information Retrieval Strategy (Major Refinement):**\n    *   **\"Reflect-Adapt-Retry\" (Validated):** The cycle worked, but not as expected. The \"Adapt\" step now includes adapting to unexpected information from a failed query.\n    *   **(New Heuristic) \"Treat Search Failures as Data\":** A search that does not return the intended document is not a null result. The documents it *does* return can provide invaluable context, correct flawed assumptions, and reveal hidden dimensions of the problem, such as a party's previous position at an earlier stage of litigation.\n    *   **(New Heuristic) \"Model the Full Procedural Posture\":** A sophisticated case analysis requires understanding the arguments at both the certiorari stage and the merits stage. The positions parties take when arguing *whether* the Court should hear a case can be just as revealing as the arguments they make once the case has been taken.\n\n3.  **Source Prioritization (Major Refinement):**\n    *   **(Refined Heuristic) \"Acquire the Cert-Stage and Merits-Stage Trilogies\":** For a complete analysis, I must seek two sets of documents: 1) **Cert Stage:** the Petition for Certiorari, the Brief in Opposition (BIO), and the petitioner's Reply to the BIO; and 2) **Merits Stage:** the Petitioner's Brief, the Respondent's Brief, and all Reply Briefs.\n    *   **(Refined Heuristic) \"The SG's Position is a Two-Stage Signal\":** The Solicitor General's position must be evaluated at both the cert stage and the merits stage. A change in position between these stages (e.g., from opposing cert to supporting reversal on the merits) is a critical predictive signal about the government's strategic calculation and desired outcome.\n\n4.  **Argument Analysis (Validated & New Heuristics):**\n    *   **\"Look for 'off-ramps' and identify who is trying to close them.\" (Validated)**\n    *   **\"Analyze how all parties frame recent legislative action.\" (Validated)**\n    *   **\"Identify the 'Goldilocks' position.\" (Validated)**\n    *   **\"Pay close attention when a party critiques its own 'side'.\" (Validated)**\n    *   **(New) \"Model the SG's Strategic Journey\":** Tracking the SG's stance from cert opposition to merits argument reveals their core priorities. A pivot from \"don't hear the case\" to \"here's how you should decide it\" is a classic executive branch strategy to manage the development of administrative law and is highly persuasive to the Court.\n    *   **(New) \"Weigh the Significance of a Cert Grant Over SG Opposition\":** When the Court agrees to hear a case that the SG advised against taking, it signals a strong judicial interest in the issue. This raises the stakes and may make the Court more inclined to heed the SG's subsequent \"damage control\" advice on the merits to ensure a workable legal rule emerges.\n\n5.  **Process Methodology (Validated & Refined):** The **\"Integrate-Reflect-Plan\"** cycle is highly effective. This observation demonstrates that the \"Integrate\" step must be robust enough to handle unexpected or contradictory information. The \"Reflect\" step successfully identified a fundamental flaw in my prior model (missing the cert stage) and the \"Plan\" step is now better informed, focusing my next action on acquiring the still-missing petitioner's reply brief, but with a much richer context for its interpretation."

          "task_beliefs": "My understanding of the case's procedural dynamics and the Court's motivation has been further sharpened, although the central question about the petitioners' final strategic choice remains unanswered. The failed search for the merits reply brief has once again yielded crucial, if adjacent, information.\n\n1.  **The SG's Strategic Journey (Stable, with a More Precise Timeline):** My model of the Solicitor General's pivot from opposing certiorari to shaping the merits remains central. The new observation provides a concrete timeline for the cert-stage battle:\n    *   **May 20, 2024:** The SG files the \"Brief for the Federal Respondents... in Opposition,\" formally advising the Court not to hear the case.\n    *   **May 28, 2024:** The petitioners file their \"Reply Brief for Petitioner,\" making their final argument for why the Court *should* grant review, directly countering the SG's opposition.\n    *   This confirms the sequence of events I had inferred and solidifies the SG's initial position as a known fact.\n\n2.  **The Court's Motivation (Reinforced and Heightened):** The fact that the Supreme Court granted certiorari on June 24, 2024\u2014less than a month after the petitioners filed their reply to the SG's opposition\u2014significantly strengthens my belief that there is a strong, pre-existing appetite among at least four justices to rule on this specific NEPA question. They were not only unpersuaded by the SG's arguments that the case was a \"poor vehicle,\" but they acted swiftly to take it up. This suggests the Court is not looking for a way out of the case; it is actively seeking to establish a rule.\n\n3.  **The Three Competing Frameworks (Stable):** The triangular contest between the Petitioners (hard limit), Respondents (broad mandate), and the SG (pragmatic middle way) remains the core analytical framework for the merits. The heightened sense of the Court's motivation makes the SG's \"middle way\" seem even more plausible as a landing spot for a majority. It allows the motivated justices to create a new, nationwide standard without adopting the petitioners' more extreme and potentially disruptive bright-line rule.\n\n4.  **The Unresolved Question (Stable and Higher Priority):** My failure to find the *merits-stage* reply brief means my primary uncertainty is unchanged. The central question is still: **How do the petitioners (Seven County) react to the SG's merits-stage brief?** Do they recognize the SG's \"middle way\" as their most likely path to victory and align with it, or do they double down on their original, rigid proximate cause standard? This document remains the single most important piece of missing evidence.\n\n**Updated Prediction:** My prediction remains a **high confidence in reversal, specifically on the Solicitor General's terms.** The new evidence of the Court's swiftness in granting cert *over the SG's objection* makes it even more likely that the Court is determined to issue a substantive ruling. In this context, the SG's carefully constructed \"middle way\" provides an ideal, institutionally-defensible resolution that accomplishes the Court's goal of clarifying the law while preserving necessary executive branch discretion. It is the most probable path to a majority opinion.",
          "design_beliefs": "This observation was another powerful lesson in the nature of information retrieval and the importance of precision in legal research. My meta-level heuristics have been validated and refined.\n\n1.  **Foundational Beliefs (Stable):** **Categorizing the legal question** and **analyzing primary source documents** remain fundamental.\n\n2.  **Information Retrieval Strategy (Major Refinement):**\n    *   **\"Treat Search Failures as Data\" (Validated):** My search for the merits reply brief failed, but it returned proof of service for the *cert-stage* reply brief, confirming its existence and timing, which is a valuable piece of the procedural puzzle.\n    *   **(New Heuristic) \"Identify and Target the Correct Counsel of Record\":** My search query `'reply brief Budd-Falen'` was flawed. The observation revealed that Karen Budd-Falen represents amici curiae, not the primary petitioner, Seven County. Future searches for party-specific documents must be based on the correct counsel of record to avoid retrieving irrelevant or secondary documents.\n    *   **(New Heuristic) \"Differentiate Procedural from Substantive Filings\":** My search returned \"Affidavits of Service,\" not the briefs themselves. While useful for confirming timelines, they lack the legal arguments. Future searches should be refined to prioritize the substantive document, perhaps by adding keywords like \"argument\" or excluding terms like \"affidavit\" or \"certificate of service.\"\n\n3.  **Source Prioritization (Major Refinement):**\n    *   **(Refined Heuristic) \"Acquire the Cert-Stage and Merits-Stage Trilogies\":** This heuristic is strongly validated. This observation confirmed the existence of the final piece of the cert-stage trilogy (the Petitioner's Reply to the BIO). My immediate priority remains acquiring the final piece of the merits-stage trilogy (the Petitioner's Reply Brief). The model is sound, but the data acquisition is incomplete.\n    *   **\"The SG's Position is a Two-Stage Signal\" (Validated):** The observation provided the filing date for the SG's cert-stage opposition, cementing its place in the case's timeline and reinforcing the significance of the SG's subsequent pivot on the merits.\n\n4.  **Argument Analysis (Validated & New Heuristics):**\n    *   **\"Model the SG's Strategic Journey\" (Validated):** This observation added concrete dates to the SG's journey, making the model more robust.\n    *   **\"Weigh the Significance of a Cert Grant Over SG Opposition\" (Strongly Validated):** The swiftness of the Court's grant of cert after receiving the SG's opposition brief underscores the power of this heuristic. It is a strong signal of the Court's intent and raises the predictive value of the SG's subsequent merits-stage guidance.\n    *   All other analysis heuristics (\"off-ramps,\" \"legislative action,\" \"Goldilocks position,\" etc.) remain stable and await the final reply brief for their ultimate application.\n\n5.  **Process Methodology (Validated & Refined):** The **\"Integrate-Reflect-Plan\"** cycle continues to be highly effective. The \"Reflect\" step correctly identified a flaw in my search query (using the wrong attorney). The \"Plan\" step is now even more focused: find the *merits-stage* reply brief filed by the *correct counsel of record* for the Seven County Infrastructure Coalition."

App. 1a-71a) \nis reported at 82 F.4th 1152.  The decisions of the Sur-\nface Transportation Board (Pet. App. 74a-190a; 190a-\n230a) are available at 2021 WL 41926 and 2021 WL \n5960905. \nJURISDICTION \nThe judgment of the court of appeals was entered on \nAugust 18, 2023.  A petition for rehearing en banc was \ndenied on December 4, 2023 (Pet. App. 72a-73a).  The \npetition for a writ of certiorari was timely filed on \nMarch 4, 2024 (Monday).  The jurisdiction of this Court \nis invoked under 28 U.S.C. 1254(1). \n\n2 \n \nSTATEMENT \n1. This case involves a challenge to the federal gov-\nernment\u2019s authorization of a new railway line in the \nUinta Basin in Utah.  Pet. App. 3a.1  \na. The Interstate Commerce Commission Termina-\ntion Act of 1995 (the Interstate Commerce Act), 49 \nU.S.C. 10101 et seq., provides the Surface Transporta-\ntion Board (Board) with authority to license the con-\nstruction and operation of new railroad lines in the in-\nterstate rail system.  See Alaska Survival v. Surface \nTransp. Bd., 705 F.3d 1073, 1078 (9th Cir. 2013).  The \nBoard\u2019s authorization of a new line takes one of two \nforms.  First, if an applicant submits a full application \nto build a new railroad line, the Board must grant the \nauthorization \u201cunless the Board finds that such activi-\nties are inconsistent with the public convenience and ne-\ncessity.\u201d  49 U.S.C. 10901(c).  Second, as in this case, an \napplicant may request Board authorization through an \n\u201cexemption\u201d process under 49 U.S.C. 10502.  \nThe Board may grant an exemption authorizing rail \nconstruction when it finds that (1) a full proceeding un-\nder Section 10901 \u201cis not necessary to carry out\u201d the rail \ntransportation policy in Section 10101 of the Interstate \nCommerce Act, and (2) either that (a) the transaction is \nlimited in scope, or (b) the application of Section 10901 \n\u201cis not needed to protect shippers from the abuse of \nmarket power.\u201d  49 U.S.C. 10502.  In an exemption pro-\nceeding, the Board considers the transportation merits \nof a project by looking to the exemption criteria in \n \n1 Federal respondent the Surface Transportation Board assessed \nthe petition for a writ of certiorari and the Board was unable to \nreach a majority decision on the response.  Accordingly, the Board \ndoes not join this opposition or otherwise take a position on the pe-\ntition. \n\n3 \n \nSection 10502, which in turn requires the Board to ana-\nlyze the rail transportation policy factors identified in \nSection 10101. \nb. The National Environmental Policy Act of 1996 \n(NEPA), 42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq., requires agencies to \ntake a \u201chard look\u201d at the environmental consequences \nof a proposed major federal action.  See, e.g., Baltimore \nGas & Elec. Co. v. Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc., 462 \nU.S. 87, 97 (1983).  When an agency determines that a \nmajor federal action will have potentially significant en-\nvironmental impacts, it must prepare an environmental \nimpact statement.  42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C).  Under NEPA, \nan agency must consider an environmental effect of a \nproposed major federal action if there is a \u201c\u2018reasonably \nclose causal relationship\u2019 between the environmental ef-\nfect and the alleged cause.\u201d  Department of Transp. v. \nPublic Citizen, 541 U.S. 752, 767 (2004) (quoting Metro-\npolitan Edison Co. v. People Against Nuclear Energy, \n460 U.S. 766, 774 (1983)).  This Court has \u201canalogized \nthis requirement to the \u2018familiar doctrine of proximate \ncause from tort law.\u2019\u201d  Ibid. (citation omitted).  It has \nalso held that \u201cwhere an agency has no ability to pre-\nvent a certain effect due to its limited statutory author-\nity over the relevant actions, the agency cannot be con-\nsidered a legally relevant \u2018cause\u2019 of the effect.\u201d  Id. at \n770. \n2. Petitioners seek to build an 85-mile-long railway \nline in Utah connecting the Uinta Basin in northeastern \nUtah to the existing interstate freight rail network near \nKyune, Utah.  Pet. App. 190a.  Presently, all freight \nmoving in and out of the Uinta Basin is transported by \ntrucks on the area\u2019s limited road network.  Id. at 192a.  \nThe proposed rail line would connect the Uinta Basin to \nthe interstate rail network to provide shippers with an \n\n4 \n \nalternative to trucking.  Id. at 192a, 206a, 208a.  Though \nthe new railway could carry any goods produced or con-\nsumed in the Basin, \u201cthe [petitioners] recognize[] (and \nno one disputes) that the Railway\u2019s predominant and ex-\npected primary purpose would be the transport of waxy \ncrude oil produced in the Uinta Basin.\u201d  Id. at 7a. \nIn May 2020, petitioners sought authorization to con-\nstruct and operate the railway through the Interstate \nCommerce Act\u2019s exemption process and requested that \nthe Board issue a preliminary decision addressing the \ntransportation merits of the exemption before complet-\ning its environmental review.  Pet. App. 6a, 8a.  The \nBoard issued a non-binding preliminary decision in Jan-\nuary 2021 assessing the railway\u2019s transportation merits.  \nId. at 191a.  The Board found, subject to the completion \nof the environmental review, that the railway met the \nstandards for an exemption under Section 10502 of the \nInterstate Commerce Act.  Ibid. \nMeanwhile, the Board performed an environmental \nanalysis under NEPA, issuing a draft environmental \nimpact statement in October 2020, and a final statement \nin August 2021.  Pet. App. 10a.  In addition, to comply \nwith the Endangered Species Act of 1973, 16 U.S.C. \n1531 et seq., the Board consulted with the Fish and \nWildlife Service (Service) regarding the effect of the \nnew railway on endangered species, and the Service is-\nsued a final biological opinion in September 2021.  Pet. \nApp. 11a.  Several months later, the Board issued its fi-\nnal exemption decision, which authorized construction \nand operation of the railway subject to environmental \nmitigation conditions.  Id. at 74a-189a. \n3. Eagle County, Colorado and several environmen-\ntal organizations filed two petitions for review\u2014which \nthe court of appeals consolidated\u2014challenging the \n\n5 \n \nBoard\u2019s preliminary and final exemption decisions, as \nwell as the Service\u2019s biological opinion.  See Pet. App. \n13a.   \nThe court of appeals granted the petitions in part \nand denied them in part.  Pet. App. 1a-71a.  The court \nconcluded that Eagle County and the environmental or-\nganizations had standing to challenge both the Board\u2019s \ndecisions and the Service\u2019s biological opinion.  Id. at \n14a-22a.  The court also held that it had subject-matter \njurisdiction to review the Board\u2019s decisions under the \nHobbs Act.  Id. at 22a-23a.  And the court held that it \nhad jurisdiction to review the Service\u2019s biological opin-\nion because the Board had relied on and incorporated \nthe opinion into its final exemption decision, and the \nBoard\u2019s decisions are subject to review exclusively in \nthe courts of appeals.  Id. at 23a.  The court then re-\nsolved numerous challenges to the merits of the federal \nagency actions in connection with the railway authori-\nzation.  Id. at 25a-69a.   \na. As most relevant here, the court of appeals held \nthat the Board\u2019s NEPA analysis should have considered \nthe upstream environmental effects of increased oil de-\nvelopment and the downstream effects of refining that \noil.  Pet. App. 30a-37a.  The court explained that the \nBoard had offered two primary reasons for excluding \nthose effects, and neither was sufficient to justify the \nagency\u2019s decision.  Id. at 30a-31a.   \nFirst, the court of appeals rejected the Board\u2019s con-\ntention that, because of the agency\u2019s \u201c\u200a\u2018lack of infor-\nmation about the\u2019 location of future oil production sites\u201d \nand the \u201c\u200a\u2018destination and end use of the [oil],\u2019\u200a\u201d the up-\nstream and downstream effects were not \u201c\u200a\u2018reasonably \nforeseeable impacts\u2019\u201d that the Board was required to \nconsider.  Pet. App. 30a, 32a (citations omitted; brackets \n\n6 \n \nin original).  The court found that the Board had \n\u201cfail[ed] to adequately explain why it could not employ \n\u2018some degree of forecasting\u2019 to identify the aforemen-\ntioned upstream and downstream impacts.\u201d  Id. at 35a \n(citation omitted).   \nSecond, the court of appeals rejected the Board\u2019s \ncontention that, under this Court\u2019s decision in Public \nCitizen, supra, it was not required to \u201cidentify and de-\nscribe the environmental effects of increased oil drilling \nand refining\u201d because the agency \u201clack[ed] the author-\nity to prevent, control, or mitigate those developments.\u201d  \nPet. App. 36a.  In the court\u2019s view, the Board had the \nauthority to prevent those effects, observing that the \nBoard had \u201cexclusive jurisdiction over the construction \nand operation of the railway, including authority to \ndeny the exemption petition if the environmental harm \ncaused by the railway outweighs its transportation ben-\nefits.\u201d  Ibid. (citing 49 U.S.C. 10501(c) and 10901(b)).  \nThe court also reasoned that the Board \u201cis authorized \nto license railroad construction and operation based on \nthe \u2018public convenience and necessity,\u2019\u200a\u201d which, the court \nconcluded, \u201cencompasses reasonably foreseeable envi-\nronmental harms.\u201d  Id. at 37a (citation omitted).  Based \non this analysis of the Board\u2019s \u201cauthority to deny an ex-\nemption to a railway project on the ground that the rail-\nway\u2019s anticipated environmental and other costs out-\nweigh its expected benefits,\u201d the court found that \u201cthe \nBoard\u2019s argument that it need not consider effects it \ncannot prevent\u201d was \u201csimply inapplicable.\u201d  Ibid.   \nb. The court of appeals also identified several other \nflaws in the Board\u2019s NEPA analysis, including its fail-\nure to take a hard look at the increased risk of rail acci-\ndents downline, Pet. App. 40a-42a, the risk and impacts \nof wildfires downline, id. at 42a-45a, and the railway\u2019s \n\n7 \n \nimpacts on water resources downline on the Colorado \nRiver, id. at 46a-47a.  In addition, the court rejected or \ndeclined to reach multiple other challenges under \nNEPA and the National Historic Preservation Act, 54 \nU.S.C. 304108.  Pet. App. 29a, 37a-39a, 47a-50a, 55a-57a.  \nThe court also found flaws in the Service\u2019s biological \nopinion, Id. at 50a-55a, and in the Board\u2019s exemption de-\ncision under the Interstate Commerce Act, Pet. App. \n57a-69a.   \nBased on the errors in the NEPA analysis and the \nbiological opinion, the \u201cfail[ure] to conduct a reasoned \napplication\u201d of the Interstate Commerce Act, and the \nBoard\u2019s \u201cfail[ure] to weigh the [railway\u2019s] uncertain fi-\nnancial viability and the full potential for environmental \nharm against the transportation benefits it identified,\u201d \nthe court of appeals vacated the exemption order as ar-\nbitrary and capricious, and partially vacated the under-\nlying NEPA assessment and biological opinion.  Pet. \nApp. 70a; see id. at 70a-71a.   \n4. Petitioners sought rehearing en banc.  The court \nof appeals denied the petition, with no judge calling for \na vote.  Pet. App. 72a\u201373a. \nARGUMENT \nPetitioners contend (Pet. 14-21) that this Court \nshould grant the petition for a writ of certiorari to re-\nsolve a disagreement in the circuits regarding the \nproper application of this Court\u2019s decision in Depart-\nment of Transp. v. Public Citizen, 541 U.S. 752 (2004).  \nThis Court\u2019s review is unwarranted because there is no \ncircuit conflict regarding the proper application of Pub-\nlic Citizen\u2019s holding that NEPA does not require an \nagency to analyze environmental effects when the \nagency \u201chas no ability to prevent\u201d those effects \u201cdue to \nits limited statutory authority.\u201d  Id. at 770.  What \n\n8 \n \npetitioners describe as differences in the courts of ap-\npeals\u2019 understanding of Public Citizen are more appro-\npriately attributed to variations in the statutory and \nregulatory authority wielded by different agencies in \ndifferent contexts.  And even if this Court were of the \nview that the question presented might warrant review \nat some point, this case would be a poor vehicle because, \namong other things, the government recently issued \nnew regulations regarding the appropriate scope of \nNEPA review, and because the court of appeals identi-\nfied several other flaws in the agency\u2019s NEPA analysis \nthat will require a revised environmental impact state-\nment regardless of the outcome of this case.  The peti-\ntion for a writ of certiorari should therefore be denied.    \n1. The courts of appeals uniformly recognize that, \nunder Public Citizen, an agency need not consider en-\nvironmental consequences it lacks the statutory and \nregulatory authority to prevent.     \na. In Public Citizen, the Court considered whether \nan agency had reasonably excluded certain environmen-\ntal effects from its NEPA analysis based on the \nagency\u2019s limited statutory mandate.  541 U.S. at 767.  \nThe case involved a NEPA challenge to safety regula-\ntions for Mexican tractor-trailer trucks that the Federal \nMotor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) prom-\nulgated after the President agreed to lift a moratorium \non the entry of Mexican trucks into the United States.  \nId. at 756, 760-761.  The agency\u2019s NEPA analysis con-\nsidered the environmental consequences of the roadside \ninspections required by its new safety rules.  But the \nanalysis did not consider the consequences of the in-\ncreased presence of Mexican trucks in the United \nStates because FMCSA determined that the increased \npresence was due to the President\u2019s decision to lift the \n\n9 \n \nmoratorium, rather than the agency\u2019s new regulations.  \nId. at 761.  Several challengers asserted that limiting \nthe NEPA analysis in that way was improper because \nthe trucks\u2019 presence should be considered an effect of \nthe regulations, on the theory that no Mexican truck \ncould operate in the United States without obtaining a \ncertification from FMCSA, and FMCSA could not issue \nany certifications for Mexican trucks until it promul-\ngated the safety rules.  Id. at 765-766.   \nThis Court rejected the challenge, finding that the \nscope of the agency\u2019s NEPA analysis was appropriate \nbecause the agency\u2019s governing statutes prevented it \nfrom barring Mexican trucks based on the environmen-\ntal effects of their entry.  Public Citizen, 541 U.S. at \n765; see id. at 767-770.  The Court explained that, while \nFMCSA was required to ensure the safety and financial \nresponsibility of the trucks operating within the United \nStates, it had no \u201cability to countermand the President\u2019s \nlifting of the moratorium or otherwise categorically to \nexclude Mexican motor carriers from operating in the \nUnited States.\u201d  Id. at 766.  To the contrary, the Court \nexplained, it would \u201cviolate\u201d the agency\u2019s statutory \nmandate for FMCSA to refuse to authorize a Mexican \nmotor carrier that was \u201cwilling and able to comply with \nthe various substantive requirements for safety and fi-\nnancial responsibility.\u201d  Ibid.  \nThe Court declined to adopt the challengers\u2019 \u201cpartic-\nularly unyielding variation of \u2018but for\u2019 causation, where \nan agency\u2019s action is considered a cause of an environ-\nmental effect even when the agency has no authority to \nprevent the effect.\u201d  Public Citizen, 541 U.S. at 767.  \nThe Court explained that the challengers\u2019 theory con-\nflicted with its prior decision in Metropolitan Edison \nCo. v. People Against Nuclear Energy, 460 U.S. 766 \n\n10 \n \n(1983), which had drawn an analogy to the doctrine of \nproximate cause under tort law and encouraged courts \nto look to NEPA\u2019s \u201cunderlying policies\u201d to draw \u201ca man-\nageable line between those causal changes that may \nmake\u201d an agency responsible for an effect under NEPA \n\u201cand those that do not.\u2019\u201d  Public Citizen, 541 U.S. at 767 \n(quoting Metropolitan Edison, 460 U.S. at 774 n.7).  The \nCourt also relied on the \u201crule of reason\u201d that is \u201cinher-\nent in NEPA and its implementing regulations,\u201d ob-\nserving that \u201cno rule of reason worthy of that title would \nrequire an agency\u201d to analyze environmental effects \nwhen the results of that analysis \u201cwould serve \u2018no pur-\npose.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Ibid. (citation omitted).    \nBased on Metropolitan Edison and the rule of rea-\nson, the Court held that \u201cwhere an agency has no ability \nto prevent a particular effect due to its limited statutory \nauthority over the relevant actions, the agency cannot \nbe considered a legally relevant \u2018cause\u2019 of that effect.\u201d  \nPublic Citizen, 541 U.S. at 770.  And because FMSCA \n\u201csimply lack[ed] the power to act on\u201d the information \nthat would have been produced by an analysis of the en-\nvironmental consequences of permitting Mexican \ntrucks to enter the United States, the Court found that \nthe agency had acted reasonably in excluding the con-\nsideration of those effects from its NEPA analysis.  Id. \nat 768.  \nb. The courts of appeals have relied on Public Citi-\nzen\u2019s holding to affirm the reasonableness of an \nagency\u2019s decision to exclude a particular environmental \neffect from its NEPA analysis where\u2014under the gov-\nerning statutory and regulatory scheme\u2014the agency \nhad \u201cno ability to prevent\u201d that effect.  541 U.S. at 770.  \nIn Center for Biological Diversity v. U.S. Army Corps \nof Engineers, 941 F.3d 1288 (2019), for example, the \n\n11 \n \nEleventh Circuit held that the Army Corps of Engi-\nneers\u2019 decision not to consider certain environmental ef-\nfects in issuing a discharge permit under the Clean Wa-\nter Act was consistent with Public Citizen because the \nCorps could not have \u201chinge[d] its permitting decision\u201d \non the relevant effects without \u201cignoring the Clean Wa-\nter Act\u2019s text and misapplying its implementing regula-\ntions.\u201d  Id. at 1298.   \nSimilarly, in Ohio Valley Environmental Coalition \nv. Aracoma Coal Co., 556 F.3d 177 (2009), cert denied, \n561 U.S. 1051 (2010), the Fourth Circuit determined \nthat, under Public Citizen, the Corps was not required \nto consider the environmental effects of coal mining op-\nerations as a whole in issuing a permit for certain \ndredge and fill activities because the governing regula-\ntions assigned the \u201ccontrol and responsibility\u201d for the \nmining operations to a different agency.  Id. at 196-197.  \nAnd in Kentuckians for the Commonwealth v. United \nStates Army Corps of Engineers, 746 F.3d 698 (2014), \nthe Sixth Circuit found that Public Citizen supported \nthe Corps\u2019 determination that it did not need to consider \nthe health effects of a mining project as a whole in issu-\ning a specific permit because the agency had deter-\nmined that it lacked \u201c\u200a\u2018sufficient control and responsibil-\nity\u2019 over the whole project\u201d under the \u201ccomplete regu-\nlatory scheme.\u201d  Id. at 710 (citation omitted).   \nCourts have also cited the limited statutory and reg-\nulatory authority of other agencies in upholding the rea-\nsonableness of limits those agencies have placed on \ntheir NEPA analyses.  Thus, in New Jersey Department \nof Environmental Protection v. United States Nuclear \nRegulatory Commission, 561 F.3d 132 (2009), the Third \nCircuit determined that the Nuclear Regulatory Com-\nmission\u2019s lack of \u201cauthority over the airspace above its \n\n12 \n \nfacilities\u201d supported the agency\u2019s determination that it \ndid not need to consider the environmental effects of an \nair attack on a nuclear facility.  Id. at 139; see id. at 140 \n(explaining that the agency\u2019s \u201clack of control over air-\nspace supports our holding\u201d); see also Protect Our \nParks, Inc. v. Buttigieg, 39 F.4th 389, 393, 400 (7th Cir. \n2022) (citing Public Citizen in holding that a federal \nagency was not required to consider a potential regula-\ntory option it lacked any authority to undertake).   \nThe D.C. Circuit, too, has recognized that an \nagency\u2019s governing statutory and regulatory frame-\nwork may limit the scope of its NEPA obligations.  In \nSierra Club v. FERC, 827 F.3d 36 (2016) (Freeport), the \nD.C. Circuit held that the Federal Energy Regulatory \nCommission (FERC) was not required \u201cto address the \nindirect effects of the anticipated export of natural gas\u201d \nas part of its NEPA analysis of the authorization of new \nnatural gas facilities because \u201cthe Department of En-\nergy, not the Commission, has sole authority to license \nthe export of any natural gas going through the [new] \nfacilities.\u201d  Id. at 47 (emphasis omitted).  The court ex-\nplained that \u201c[i]n the specific circumstances where, as \nhere, an agency \u2018has no ability to prevent a certain ef-\nfect due to\u2019 that agency\u2019s \u2018limited statutory authority \nover the relevant action,\u2019\u200a\u201d the agency need not consider \nthat effect.  Ibid. (quoting Public Citizen, 541 U.S. at \n771).   \nThe D.C. Circuit reached the same conclusion in two \nother cases involving challenges to FERC\u2019s decision to \nexclude the environmental effects of the export of natu-\nral gas from its NEPA analyses.  Sierra Club v. FERC, \n827 F.3d 59 (2016) (Sabine Pass); EarthReports, Inc. v. \nFERC, 828 F.3d 949 (2016).  And in a fourth case, Sierra \nClub v. FERC, 867 F.3d 1357 (D.C. Cir. 2017) (Sabal \n\n13 \n \nTrail), the court of appeals applied the same principles, \nbut found that Public Citizen did not support FERC\u2019s \ndecision to exclude certain adverse environmental ef-\nfects from its NEPA analysis of the propriety of issuing \na pipeline certificate because of differences in the gov-\nerning statute.  Id. at 1372-1373.  The court explained \nthat, in the first three cases, FERC could not have con-\nsidered the environmental effects of natural gas exports \n\u201cwhen regulating in its proper sphere.\u201d  Ibid.  But the \ncourt determined that in Sabal Trail, the agency \n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

App. 1a-71a) \nis reported at 82 F.4th 1152.  The decisions of the Sur-\nface Transportation Board (Pet. App. 74a-190a; 190a-\n230a) are available at 2021 WL 41926 and 2021 WL \n5960905. \nJURISDICTION \nThe judgment of the court of appeals was entered on \nAugust 18, 2023.  A petition for rehearing en banc was \ndenied on December 4, 2023 (Pet. App. 72a-73a).  The \npetition for a writ of certiorari was timely filed on \nMarch 4, 2024 (Monday).  The jurisdiction of this Court \nis invoked under 28 U.S.C. 1254(1). \n\n2 \n \nSTATEMENT \n1. This case involves a challenge to the federal gov-\nernment\u2019s authorization of a new railway line in the \nUinta Basin in Utah.  Pet. App. 3a.1  \na. The Interstate Commerce Commission Termina-\ntion Act of 1995 (the Interstate Commerce Act), 49 \nU.S.C. 10101 et seq., provides the Surface Transporta-\ntion Board (Board) with authority to license the con-\nstruction and operation of new railroad lines in the in-\nterstate rail system.  See Alaska Survival v. Surface \nTransp. Bd., 705 F.3d 1073, 1078 (9th Cir. 2013).  The \nBoard\u2019s authorization of a new line takes one of two \nforms.  First, if an applicant submits a full application \nto build a new railroad line, the Board must grant the \nauthorization \u201cunless the Board finds that such activi-\nties are inconsistent with the public convenience and ne-\ncessity.\u201d  49 U.S.C. 10901(c).  Second, as in this case, an \napplicant may request Board authorization through an \n\u201cexemption\u201d process under 49 U.S.C. 10502.  \nThe Board may grant an exemption authorizing rail \nconstruction when it finds that (1) a full proceeding un-\nder Section 10901 \u201cis not necessary to carry out\u201d the rail \ntransportation policy in Section 10101 of the Interstate \nCommerce Act, and (2) either that (a) the transaction is \nlimited in scope, or (b) the application of Section 10901 \n\u201cis not needed to protect shippers from the abuse of \nmarket power.\u201d  49 U.S.C. 10502.  In an exemption pro-\nceeding, the Board considers the transportation merits \nof a project by looking to the exemption criteria in \n \n1 Federal respondent the Surface Transportation Board assessed \nthe petition for a writ of certiorari and the Board was unable to \nreach a majority decision on the response.  Accordingly, the Board \ndoes not join this opposition or otherwise take a position on the pe-\ntition. \n\n3 \n \nSection 10502, which in turn requires the Board to ana-\nlyze the rail transportation policy factors identified in \nSection 10101. \nb. The National Environmental Policy Act of 1996 \n(NEPA), 42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq., requires agencies to \ntake a \u201chard look\u201d at the environmental consequences \nof a proposed major federal action.  See, e.g., Baltimore \nGas & Elec. Co. v. Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc., 462 \nU.S. 87, 97 (1983).  When an agency determines that a \nmajor federal action will have potentially significant en-\nvironmental impacts, it must prepare an environmental \nimpact statement.  42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C).  Under NEPA, \nan agency must consider an environmental effect of a \nproposed major federal action if there is a \u201c\u2018reasonably \nclose causal relationship\u2019 between the environmental ef-\nfect and the alleged cause.\u201d  Department of Transp. v. \nPublic Citizen, 541 U.S. 752, 767 (2004) (quoting Metro-\npolitan Edison Co. v. People Against Nuclear Energy, \n460 U.S. 766, 774 (1983)).  This Court has \u201canalogized \nthis requirement to the \u2018familiar doctrine of proximate \ncause from tort law.\u2019\u201d  Ibid. (citation omitted).  It has \nalso held that \u201cwhere an agency has no ability to pre-\nvent a certain effect due to its limited statutory author-\nity over the relevant actions, the agency cannot be con-\nsidered a legally relevant \u2018cause\u2019 of the effect.\u201d  Id. at \n770. \n2. Petitioners seek to build an 85-mile-long railway \nline in Utah connecting the Uinta Basin in northeastern \nUtah to the existing interstate freight rail network near \nKyune, Utah.  Pet. App. 190a.  Presently, all freight \nmoving in and out of the Uinta Basin is transported by \ntrucks on the area\u2019s limited road network.  Id. at 192a.  \nThe proposed rail line would connect the Uinta Basin to \nthe interstate rail network to provide shippers with an \n\n4 \n \nalternative to trucking.  Id. at 192a, 206a, 208a.  Though \nthe new railway could carry any goods produced or con-\nsumed in the Basin, \u201cthe [petitioners] recognize[] (and \nno one disputes) that the Railway\u2019s predominant and ex-\npected primary purpose would be the transport of waxy \ncrude oil produced in the Uinta Basin.\u201d  Id. at 7a. \nIn May 2020, petitioners sought authorization to con-\nstruct and operate the railway through the Interstate \nCommerce Act\u2019s exemption process and requested that \nthe Board issue a preliminary decision addressing the \ntransportation merits of the exemption before complet-\ning its environmental review.  Pet. App. 6a, 8a.  The \nBoard issued a non-binding preliminary decision in Jan-\nuary 2021 assessing the railway\u2019s transportation merits.  \nId. at 191a.  The Board found, subject to the completion \nof the environmental review, that the railway met the \nstandards for an exemption under Section 10502 of the \nInterstate Commerce Act.  Ibid. \nMeanwhile, the Board performed an environmental \nanalysis under NEPA, issuing a draft environmental \nimpact statement in October 2020, and a final statement \nin August 2021.  Pet. App. 10a.  In addition, to comply \nwith the Endangered Species Act of 1973, 16 U.S.C. \n1531 et seq., the Board consulted with the Fish and \nWildlife Service (Service) regarding the effect of the \nnew railway on endangered species, and the Service is-\nsued a final biological opinion in September 2021.  Pet. \nApp. 11a.  Several months later, the Board issued its fi-\nnal exemption decision, which authorized construction \nand operation of the railway subject to environmental \nmitigation conditions.  Id. at 74a-189a. \n3. Eagle County, Colorado and several environmen-\ntal organizations filed two petitions for review\u2014which \nthe court of appeals consolidated\u2014challenging the \n\n5 \n \nBoard\u2019s preliminary and final exemption decisions, as \nwell as the Service\u2019s biological opinion.  See Pet. App. \n13a.   \nThe court of appeals granted the petitions in part \nand denied them in part.  Pet. App. 1a-71a.  The court \nconcluded that Eagle County and the environmental or-\nganizations had standing to challenge both the Board\u2019s \ndecisions and the Service\u2019s biological opinion.  Id. at \n14a-22a.  The court also held that it had subject-matter \njurisdiction to review the Board\u2019s decisions under the \nHobbs Act.  Id. at 22a-23a.  And the court held that it \nhad jurisdiction to review the Service\u2019s biological opin-\nion because the Board had relied on and incorporated \nthe opinion into its final exemption decision, and the \nBoard\u2019s decisions are subject to review exclusively in \nthe courts of appeals.  Id. at 23a.  The court then re-\nsolved numerous challenges to the merits of the federal \nagency actions in connection with the railway authori-\nzation.  Id. at 25a-69a.   \na. As most relevant here, the court of appeals held \nthat the Board\u2019s NEPA analysis should have considered \nthe upstream environmental effects of increased oil de-\nvelopment and the downstream effects of refining that \noil.  Pet. App. 30a-37a.  The court explained that the \nBoard had offered two primary reasons for excluding \nthose effects, and neither was sufficient to justify the \nagency\u2019s decision.  Id. at 30a-31a.   \nFirst, the court of appeals rejected the Board\u2019s con-\ntention that, because of the agency\u2019s \u201c\u200a\u2018lack of infor-\nmation about the\u2019 location of future oil production sites\u201d \nand the \u201c\u200a\u2018destination and end use of the [oil],\u2019\u200a\u201d the up-\nstream and downstream effects were not \u201c\u200a\u2018reasonably \nforeseeable impacts\u2019\u201d that the Board was required to \nconsider.  Pet. App. 30a, 32a (citations omitted; brackets \n\n6 \n \nin original).  The court found that the Board had \n\u201cfail[ed] to adequately explain why it could not employ \n\u2018some degree of forecasting\u2019 to identify the aforemen-\ntioned upstream and downstream impacts.\u201d  Id. at 35a \n(citation omitted).   \nSecond, the court of appeals rejected the Board\u2019s \ncontention that, under this Court\u2019s decision in Public \nCitizen, supra, it was not required to \u201cidentify and de-\nscribe the environmental effects of increased oil drilling \nand refining\u201d because the agency \u201clack[ed] the author-\nity to prevent, control, or mitigate those developments.\u201d  \nPet. App. 36a.  In the court\u2019s view, the Board had the \nauthority to prevent those effects, observing that the \nBoard had \u201cexclusive jurisdiction over the construction \nand operation of the railway, including authority to \ndeny the exemption petition if the environmental harm \ncaused by the railway outweighs its transportation ben-\nefits.\u201d  Ibid. (citing 49 U.S.C. 10501(c) and 10901(b)).  \nThe court also reasoned that the Board \u201cis authorized \nto license railroad construction and operation based on \nthe \u2018public convenience and necessity,\u2019\u200a\u201d which, the court \nconcluded, \u201cencompasses reasonably foreseeable envi-\nronmental harms.\u201d  Id. at 37a (citation omitted).  Based \non this analysis of the Board\u2019s \u201cauthority to deny an ex-\nemption to a railway project on the ground that the rail-\nway\u2019s anticipated environmental and other costs out-\nweigh its expected benefits,\u201d the court found that \u201cthe \nBoard\u2019s argument that it need not consider effects it \ncannot prevent\u201d was \u201csimply inapplicable.\u201d  Ibid.   \nb. The court of appeals also identified several other \nflaws in the Board\u2019s NEPA analysis, including its fail-\nure to take a hard look at the increased risk of rail acci-\ndents downline, Pet. App. 40a-42a, the risk and impacts \nof wildfires downline, id. at 42a-45a, and the railway\u2019s \n\n7 \n \nimpacts on water resources downline on the Colorado \nRiver, id. at 46a-47a.  In addition, the court rejected or \ndeclined to reach multiple other challenges under \nNEPA and the National Historic Preservation Act, 54 \nU.S.C. 304108.  Pet. App. 29a, 37a-39a, 47a-50a, 55a-57a.  \nThe court also found flaws in the Service\u2019s biological \nopinion, Id. at 50a-55a, and in the Board\u2019s exemption de-\ncision under the Interstate Commerce Act, Pet. App. \n57a-69a.   \nBased on the errors in the NEPA analysis and the \nbiological opinion, the \u201cfail[ure] to conduct a reasoned \napplication\u201d of the Interstate Commerce Act, and the \nBoard\u2019s \u201cfail[ure] to weigh the [railway\u2019s] uncertain fi-\nnancial viability and the full potential for environmental \nharm against the transportation benefits it identified,\u201d \nthe court of appeals vacated the exemption order as ar-\nbitrary and capricious, and partially vacated the under-\nlying NEPA assessment and biological opinion.  Pet. \nApp. 70a; see id. at 70a-71a.   \n4. Petitioners sought rehearing en banc.  The court \nof appeals denied the petition, with no judge calling for \na vote.  Pet. App. 72a\u201373a. \nARGUMENT \nPetitioners contend (Pet. 14-21) that this Court \nshould grant the petition for a writ of certiorari to re-\nsolve a disagreement in the circuits regarding the \nproper application of this Court\u2019s decision in Depart-\nment of Transp. v. Public Citizen, 541 U.S. 752 (2004).  \nThis Court\u2019s review is unwarranted because there is no \ncircuit conflict regarding the proper application of Pub-\nlic Citizen\u2019s holding that NEPA does not require an \nagency to analyze environmental effects when the \nagency \u201chas no ability to prevent\u201d those effects \u201cdue to \nits limited statutory authority.\u201d  Id. at 770.  What \n\n8 \n \npetitioners describe as differences in the courts of ap-\npeals\u2019 understanding of Public Citizen are more appro-\npriately attributed to variations in the statutory and \nregulatory authority wielded by different agencies in \ndifferent contexts.  And even if this Court were of the \nview that the question presented might warrant review \nat some point, this case would be a poor vehicle because, \namong other things, the government recently issued \nnew regulations regarding the appropriate scope of \nNEPA review, and because the court of appeals identi-\nfied several other flaws in the agency\u2019s NEPA analysis \nthat will require a revised environmental impact state-\nment regardless of the outcome of this case.  The peti-\ntion for a writ of certiorari should therefore be denied.    \n1. The courts of appeals uniformly recognize that, \nunder Public Citizen, an agency need not consider en-\nvironmental consequences it lacks the statutory and \nregulatory authority to prevent.     \na. In Public Citizen, the Court considered whether \nan agency had reasonably excluded certain environmen-\ntal effects from its NEPA analysis based on the \nagency\u2019s limited statutory mandate.  541 U.S. at 767.  \nThe case involved a NEPA challenge to safety regula-\ntions for Mexican tractor-trailer trucks that the Federal \nMotor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) prom-\nulgated after the President agreed to lift a moratorium \non the entry of Mexican trucks into the United States.  \nId. at 756, 760-761.  The agency\u2019s NEPA analysis con-\nsidered the environmental consequences of the roadside \ninspections required by its new safety rules.  But the \nanalysis did not consider the consequences of the in-\ncreased presence of Mexican trucks in the United \nStates because FMCSA determined that the increased \npresence was due to the President\u2019s decision to lift the \n\n9 \n \nmoratorium, rather than the agency\u2019s new regulations.  \nId. at 761.  Several challengers asserted that limiting \nthe NEPA analysis in that way was improper because \nthe trucks\u2019 presence should be considered an effect of \nthe regulations, on the theory that no Mexican truck \ncould operate in the United States without obtaining a \ncertification from FMCSA, and FMCSA could not issue \nany certifications for Mexican trucks until it promul-\ngated the safety rules.  Id. at 765-766.   \nThis Court rejected the challenge, finding that the \nscope of the agency\u2019s NEPA analysis was appropriate \nbecause the agency\u2019s governing statutes prevented it \nfrom barring Mexican trucks based on the environmen-\ntal effects of their entry.  Public Citizen, 541 U.S. at \n765; see id. at 767-770.  The Court explained that, while \nFMCSA was required to ensure the safety and financial \nresponsibility of the trucks operating within the United \nStates, it had no \u201cability to countermand the President\u2019s \nlifting of the moratorium or otherwise categorically to \nexclude Mexican motor carriers from operating in the \nUnited States.\u201d  Id. at 766.  To the contrary, the Court \nexplained, it would \u201cviolate\u201d the agency\u2019s statutory \nmandate for FMCSA to refuse to authorize a Mexican \nmotor carrier that was \u201cwilling and able to comply with \nthe various substantive requirements for safety and fi-\nnancial responsibility.\u201d  Ibid.  \nThe Court declined to adopt the challengers\u2019 \u201cpartic-\nularly unyielding variation of \u2018but for\u2019 causation, where \nan agency\u2019s action is considered a cause of an environ-\nmental effect even when the agency has no authority to \nprevent the effect.\u201d  Public Citizen, 541 U.S. at 767.  \nThe Court explained that the challengers\u2019 theory con-\nflicted with its prior decision in Metropolitan Edison \nCo. v. People Against Nuclear Energy, 460 U.S. 766 \n\n10 \n \n(1983), which had drawn an analogy to the doctrine of \nproximate cause under tort law and encouraged courts \nto look to NEPA\u2019s \u201cunderlying policies\u201d to draw \u201ca man-\nageable line between those causal changes that may \nmake\u201d an agency responsible for an effect under NEPA \n\u201cand those that do not.\u2019\u201d  Public Citizen, 541 U.S. at 767 \n(quoting Metropolitan Edison, 460 U.S. at 774 n.7).  The \nCourt also relied on the \u201crule of reason\u201d that is \u201cinher-\nent in NEPA and its implementing regulations,\u201d ob-\nserving that \u201cno rule of reason worthy of that title would \nrequire an agency\u201d to analyze environmental effects \nwhen the results of that analysis \u201cwould serve \u2018no pur-\npose.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Ibid. (citation omitted).    \nBased on Metropolitan Edison and the rule of rea-\nson, the Court held that \u201cwhere an agency has no ability \nto prevent a particular effect due to its limited statutory \nauthority over the relevant actions, the agency cannot \nbe considered a legally relevant \u2018cause\u2019 of that effect.\u201d  \nPublic Citizen, 541 U.S. at 770.  And because FMSCA \n\u201csimply lack[ed] the power to act on\u201d the information \nthat would have been produced by an analysis of the en-\nvironmental consequences of permitting Mexican \ntrucks to enter the United States, the Court found that \nthe agency had acted reasonably in excluding the con-\nsideration of those effects from its NEPA analysis.  Id. \nat 768.  \nb. The courts of appeals have relied on Public Citi-\nzen\u2019s holding to affirm the reasonableness of an \nagency\u2019s decision to exclude a particular environmental \neffect from its NEPA analysis where\u2014under the gov-\nerning statutory and regulatory scheme\u2014the agency \nhad \u201cno ability to prevent\u201d that effect.  541 U.S. at 770.  \nIn Center for Biological Diversity v. U.S. Army Corps \nof Engineers, 941 F.3d 1288 (2019), for example, the \n\n11 \n \nEleventh Circuit held that the Army Corps of Engi-\nneers\u2019 decision not to consider certain environmental ef-\nfects in issuing a discharge permit under the Clean Wa-\nter Act was consistent with Public Citizen because the \nCorps could not have \u201chinge[d] its permitting decision\u201d \non the relevant effects without \u201cignoring the Clean Wa-\nter Act\u2019s text and misapplying its implementing regula-\ntions.\u201d  Id. at 1298.   \nSimilarly, in Ohio Valley Environmental Coalition \nv. Aracoma Coal Co., 556 F.3d 177 (2009), cert denied, \n561 U.S. 1051 (2010), the Fourth Circuit determined \nthat, under Public Citizen, the Corps was not required \nto consider the environmental effects of coal mining op-\nerations as a whole in issuing a permit for certain \ndredge and fill activities because the governing regula-\ntions assigned the \u201ccontrol and responsibility\u201d for the \nmining operations to a different agency.  Id. at 196-197.  \nAnd in Kentuckians for the Commonwealth v. United \nStates Army Corps of Engineers, 746 F.3d 698 (2014), \nthe Sixth Circuit found that Public Citizen supported \nthe Corps\u2019 determination that it did not need to consider \nthe health effects of a mining project as a whole in issu-\ning a specific permit because the agency had deter-\nmined that it lacked \u201c\u200a\u2018sufficient control and responsibil-\nity\u2019 over the whole project\u201d under the \u201ccomplete regu-\nlatory scheme.\u201d  Id. at 710 (citation omitted).   \nCourts have also cited the limited statutory and reg-\nulatory authority of other agencies in upholding the rea-\nsonableness of limits those agencies have placed on \ntheir NEPA analyses.  Thus, in New Jersey Department \nof Environmental Protection v. United States Nuclear \nRegulatory Commission, 561 F.3d 132 (2009), the Third \nCircuit determined that the Nuclear Regulatory Com-\nmission\u2019s lack of \u201cauthority over the airspace above its \n\n12 \n \nfacilities\u201d supported the agency\u2019s determination that it \ndid not need to consider the environmental effects of an \nair attack on a nuclear facility.  Id. at 139; see id. at 140 \n(explaining that the agency\u2019s \u201clack of control over air-\nspace supports our holding\u201d); see also Protect Our \nParks, Inc. v. Buttigieg, 39 F.4th 389, 393, 400 (7th Cir. \n2022) (citing Public Citizen in holding that a federal \nagency was not required to consider a potential regula-\ntory option it lacked any authority to undertake).   \nThe D.C. Circuit, too, has recognized that an \nagency\u2019s governing statutory and regulatory frame-\nwork may limit the scope of its NEPA obligations.  In \nSierra Club v. FERC, 827 F.3d 36 (2016) (Freeport), the \nD.C. Circuit held that the Federal Energy Regulatory \nCommission (FERC) was not required \u201cto address the \nindirect effects of the anticipated export of natural gas\u201d \nas part of its NEPA analysis of the authorization of new \nnatural gas facilities because \u201cthe Department of En-\nergy, not the Commission, has sole authority to license \nthe export of any natural gas going through the [new] \nfacilities.\u201d  Id. at 47 (emphasis omitted).  The court ex-\nplained that \u201c[i]n the specific circumstances where, as \nhere, an agency \u2018has no ability to prevent a certain ef-\nfect due to\u2019 that agency\u2019s \u2018limited statutory authority \nover the relevant action,\u2019\u200a\u201d the agency need not consider \nthat effect.  Ibid. (quoting Public Citizen, 541 U.S. at \n771).   \nThe D.C. Circuit reached the same conclusion in two \nother cases involving challenges to FERC\u2019s decision to \nexclude the environmental effects of the export of natu-\nral gas from its NEPA analyses.  Sierra Club v. FERC, \n827 F.3d 59 (2016) (Sabine Pass); EarthReports, Inc. v. \nFERC, 828 F.3d 949 (2016).  And in a fourth case, Sierra \nClub v. FERC, 867 F.3d 1357 (D.C. Cir. 2017) (Sabal \n\n13 \n \nTrail), the court of appeals applied the same principles, \nbut found that Public Citizen did not support FERC\u2019s \ndecision to exclude certain adverse environmental ef-\nfects from its NEPA analysis of the propriety of issuing \na pipeline certificate because of differences in the gov-\nerning statute.  Id. at 1372-1373.  The court explained \nthat, in the first three cases, FERC could not have con-\nsidered the environmental effects of natural gas exports \n\u201cwhen regulating in its proper sphere.\u201d  Ibid.  But the \ncourt determined that in Sabal Trail, the agency was \nacting under a different and broader grant of statutory \nauthority that instructed the agency to consider \u201cthe \npublic convenience and necessity.\u201d  Ibid. (citation omit-\nted).  The court found that, under that distinct provi-\nsion, the agency was permitted to \u201cdeny a pipeline cer-\ntificate on the ground that the pipeline would be too \nharmful to the environment.\u201d  Ibid.  \u201cPublic Citizen \nthus did not excuse FERC from considering these indi-\nrect effects.\u201d   Ibid. \nc. The court of appeals acted in accordance with \nthose decisions in this case when it determined that, be-\ncause of the scope of the Surface Transportation \nBoard\u2019s statutory and regulatory authority, the Board \ncould not rely on Public Citizen as a basis for not con-\nsidering the environmental effects of increased oil drill-\ning and refining in its NEPA analysis.  Pet. App. 36a.  \nThe court did not dispute the principle that an agency \nneed not consider the environmental effects of develop-\nments that it \u201clacks authority to prevent, control, or \nmitigate.\u201d  Ibid.  The court instead found that principle \n\u201csimply inapplicable\u201d in light of the Board\u2019s statutory \nand regulatory authority.  Id. at 37a.  In the court\u2019s \nview, the governing framework\u2014including the Board\u2019s \nstatutory mandate \u201cto license railroad construction and \n\n14 \n \noperation based on the \u2018public convenience and neces-\nsity\u2019\u200a\u201d\u2014gave the Board \u201cthe authority to deny an  \nexemption to a railway project on the ground that the \nrailway\u2019s anticipated environmental and other costs \noutweigh its expected benefits.\u201d  Ibid. (citation omit-\nted). \n2. Petitioners are therefore mistaken in asserting \n(Pet. 20) that there is a \u201csharp split between the D.C. \nCircuit\u2019s reading of Public Citizen and the reading em-\nployed by the Third, Fourth, Sixth, Seventh, and Elev-\nenth Circuits.\u201d  All of those courts recognize that, be-\ncause Public Citizen held that an agency need not con-\nsider environmental effects it cannot prevent, the scope \nof the requisite NEPA analysis will depend on the scope \nof the particular agency\u2019s statutory and regulatory au-\nthority.  And while the D.C. Circuit has sometimes \nfound that Public Citizen does not excuse an agency\u2019s \nfailure to consider certain environmental effects, it has \ndone so based on its understanding of the breadth of the \nagency\u2019s authority in the particular case, not a disagree-\nment regarding Public Citizen\u2019s holding.   \nPetitioners\u2019 assertion to the contrary is based pri-\nmarily (Pet. 18-19) on the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s criticism of \nthe D.C. Circuit\u2019s decision in Sabal Trail, but that crit-\nicism does not establish an inter-circuit conflict because \nthe Eleventh Circuit described Sabal Trail as \u201cat odds \nwith earlier D.C. Circuit cases correctly\u201d recognizing \nthe limits on the environmental analysis NEPA re-\nquires.  Center For Biological Diversity, 941 F.3d at \n1300.  Therefore, at most, the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s criti-\ncism suggests an intra-circuit conflict that would not \nwarrant this Court\u2019s intervention.  Wisniewski v. \nUnited States, 353 U.S. 901, 902 (1957) (per curiam) (\u201cIt \n\n15 \n \nis primarily the task of a Court of Appeals to reconcile \nits internal difficulties.\u201d).   \nIn any event, while the Eleventh Circuit criticized \nSabal Trail for \u201cfail[ing] to take seriously the rule of \nreason announced in Public Citizen,\u201d in the very next \nparagraph, the Eleventh Circuit described that \u201crule of \nreason\u201d as dictating that \u201cagencies are not required to \nconsider effects that they lack the statutory authority \ncategorically to prevent.\u201d  Center for Biological Diver-\nsity, 941 F.3d at 1300.  Neither Sabal Trail nor the de-\ncision below purported to reject that principle.  Instead, \nboth held that\u2014because the governing statutory provi-\nsions gave the agency the authority to consider and dis-\napprove the relevant project based on the increased \nharm to the environment that the project would cause\u2014\nthe agency had the statutory authority to prevent that \nincreased harm.  See Sabal Trail, 867 F.3d at 1373; Pet. \nApp. 37a.   \nPetitioners err in contending (Pet. 20) that differ-\nences in the governing statutory and regulatory frame-\nwork \u201ccannot account for the circuits\u2019 conflicting inter-\npretations\u201d because the Corps of Engineers in the other \ndecisions had \u201cjust as much power\u201d as the agencies in \nSabal Trail and the decision below.  The Eleventh Cir-\ncuit itself held otherwise, recognizing that Sabal Trail \nwas distinguishable from its own decision in Center for \nBiological Diversity because, among other things, \u201cthe \nagency\u2019s statutory authority in Sabal Trail was much \nbroader than the Corps\u2019 here.\u201d  941 F.3d at 1299.   \nPetitioners also err in asserting (Pet. 19) that the \nNinth Circuit\u2019s decision in Center for Biological Diver-\nsity v. Bernhardt, 982 F.3d 723 (2020), suggests disa-\ngreement in the circuits regarding Public Citizen\u2019s \nmeaning.  The main NEPA challenge in that case \n\n16 \n \ninvolved whether it was technically feasible for the \nagency to quantify emissions resulting from the foreign \nconsumption of oil.  Id. at 737-740.  The court cited and \ndescribed the D.C. Circuit\u2019s decision in Sabal Trail in \njustifying its conclusion that an agency may not excuse \nits failure to assess the environmental effects of \u201cindi-\nrect greenhouse gas emissions\u201d based on the agency\u2019s \nneed to make \u201cassumptions\u201d in order to estimate those \neffects.  Id. at 737.  The Ninth Circuit did not discuss \neither Public Citizen or Sabal Trail\u2019s treatment of that \ncase, mentioning Public Citizen only in a \u201ccf.\u201d cite to a \nsentence stating that the agency \u201cha[d] the statutory \nauthority to act on the emissions resulting from foreign \noil consumption.\u201d  Id. at 740.   \n3. Petitioners\u2019 other arguments in support of review \nlack merit, and this case would be a poor vehicle even if \nthe Court was inclined to consider the question pre-\nsented.   \na. Petitioners contend (Pet. 21-23) that the decision \nbelow warrants this Court\u2019s intervention because the \nD.C. Circuit\u2019s approach to Public Citizen turns agen-\ncies into \u201cenvironmental-policy czars.\u201d  Pet. 22 (citation \nand emphasis omitted).  But the decision below merely \nfound that the Board had the statutory authority to con-\nsider the environmental effects of increased oil drilling \nand refining, Pet. App. 36a, and remanded to the Board \nso that it could either analyze those effects or \u201cexplain \nin more detail\u201d why it could not identify and quantify \nthem, Id. at 34a (citation omitted); see id. at 35a (hold-\ning that the Board had not \u201cadequately explain[ed] why \nit could not employ\u201d forecasting and other methods to \nestimate those effects).  The decision therefore does not \nrequire the Board to refuse to authorize the railway \nbased on the environmental effects of increased oil \n\n17 \n \ndrilling and refining, and it does not even require the \nBoard to consider those effects if it can adequately ex-\nplain why their consideration is not feasible.   \nMoreover, petitioners do not challenge the court of \nappeals\u2019 understanding of the Board\u2019s statutory author-\nity to deny an exemption based on the relevant environ-\nmental effects.  Rather, petitioners state that the court \n\u201cwas right\u201d to find \u201cthat the Board could decline the \nproject \u2018if the environmental harm caused by the rail-\nway outweigh[ed] its transportation benefits.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Pet. 23 \n(quoting Pet. App. 36a) (brackets in original).  And pe-\ntitioners do not contend that there is any disagreement \nin the courts of appeals regarding that conclusion. \nb. Petitioners also assert (Pet. 24-25) that the Court \nshould grant review because in 2022 the Council on En-\nvironmental Quality (CEQ) issued regulations address-\ning the appropriate scope of NEPA review.  See 87 Fed. \nReg. 23,453 (Apr. 20, 2022).  Petitioners maintain (Pet. \n24) that the Federal Register notice accompanying the \n2022 rules contains an analysis of Public Citizen that \ndiffers from that reflected in the CEQ\u2019s 2020 regula-\ntions, 85 Fed. Reg. 43,304 (July 16, 2020).  The court of \nappeals\u2019 decision, however, does not analyze or discuss \neither the 2022 or 2020 regulations, because the Board\u2019s \nNEPA analysis was performed \u201cunder pre-2020 regula-\ntions.\u201d  Pet. App. 26a.  And those intervening regulatory \ndevelopments, as well as a further set of relevant regu-\nlations released by the CEQ earlier this month, 89 Fed. \nReg. 35,442 (May 1, 2024), provide an additional reason \nto deny certiorari, because the circuits have not yet had \nan opportunity to assess whether or how the new regu-\nlations may affect their approach.   \nc. This case would also be a poor vehicle for review \nbecause the holding that is the subject of this petition \n\n18 \n \nwas just one of several independent holdings adverse to \nthe Board and the federal government.  In assessing the \nBoard\u2019s NEPA compliance, the court of appeals also \nheld that the Board had failed to adequately analyze \nthree other environmental effects (downline rail acci-\ndents, risks and impacts of wildfires, and impacts on wa-\nter resources).  Pet. App. 40a-47a.  Those holdings \nwould not be affected by the resolution of the question \npresented, and the same is true with respect to the \ncourt\u2019s holdings regarding the flaws in the Fish and \nWildlife Service\u2019s biological opinion, and some of the de-\nfects the court identified in the Board\u2019s application of \nthe Interstate Commerce Act.  See id. at 57a-69a.  Be-\ncause of these additional deficiencies, id. at 70a, the \nBoard and the Fish and Wildlife Service would be re-\nquired to issue revised decisions regardless of the out-\ncome of this petition.   \nd. Finally, this case would be an unsuitable vehicle \nbecause petitioners did not challenge the D.C. Circuit\u2019s \nunderstanding of Public Citizen before the court of ap-\npeals.  While the Board relied on Public Citizen in ex-\nplaining the scope of its NEPA analysis, Pet. App. 135a, \npetitioners did not discuss or even cite that case in their \npanel briefing.  See C.A. Doc. 1990837 (Mar. 20, 2023).  \nAnd their petition for rehearing en banc likewise did not \ndiscuss Public Citizen or suggest that the panel\u2019s un-\nderstanding of that decision implicated or created a di-\nvision in the circuits.  See C.A. Doc. 2019520 (Sept. 29, \n2023).  Instead, petitioners argued that the panel\u2019s \nNEPA analysis conflicted with other D.C. Circuit deci-\nsions.  See id. at 9-13.  Accordingly, the court of appeals \ndid not have an opportunity to consider petitioners\u2019 ar-\nguments regarding the proper application of Public Cit-\nizen, and this Court should not do so in the first \n\n19 \n \ninstance.  Cf. Byrd v. United States, 584 U.S. 395, 404 \n(2018) (observing that \u201cit is generally unwise\u201d for this \nCourt \u201cto consider arguments in the first instance\u201d).   \nCONCLUSION \nThe petition for a writ of certiorari should be denied.  \nRespectfully submitted. \n \n \nELIZABETH B.

          "task_beliefs": "My understanding of the case's key actors and their likely strategies has been significantly sharpened, bringing the final, decisive question into clearer focus. The identity of the petitioners' lead counsel is a major new signal that refines my predictive model.\n\n1.  **The Three Competing Frameworks (Stable):** The core of the case remains the contest between the Petitioners' proposed bright-line \"proximate cause\" limit, the Respondents' call for a broad, effects-based mandate under NEPA, and the Solicitor General's pragmatic \"middle way\" focused on agency control and reasonable foreseeability.\n\n2.  **The Court's Motivation (Stable and Reinforced):** The Court's swiftness in granting certiorari over the SG's initial opposition remains a powerful signal. It indicates a strong desire among at least four justices to clarify the scope of NEPA analysis, making a substantive ruling highly probable.\n\n3.  **Procedural Timeline and Key Actors (Major Update):** The previous observation's metadata has yielded two critical facts:\n    *   **Filing Date:** The petitioners' final merits-stage reply brief was filed on November 18, 2024. This completes the timeline of the core briefing.\n    *   **Counsel of Record:** The petitioners are represented by **Paul Clement**, one of the nation's most experienced and respected Supreme Court advocates. This is a new, highly significant variable. Clement's involvement signals the high stakes of the case and, more importantly, brings a particular style of advocacy to the petitioners' side. He is known for his institutional awareness and strategic pragmatism, not for ideological intransigence.\n\n4.  **The Unresolved Question (Refined and Higher Priority):** My primary uncertainty remains the content of the petitioners' reply brief. However, the question is no longer a simple binary of \"align or double-down.\" It is now: **\"How did Paul Clement, a master strategist, frame the petitioners' final argument in light of the SG's 'middle way' brief?\"** The identity of the author dramatically shifts the probabilities. It is now much more likely that the reply brief will be a sophisticated document that strategically engages with the SG's position, identifying it as the most plausible path to victory, rather than simply reiterating the original, more rigid arguments from the petition for certiorari.\n\n**Updated Prediction:** My prediction of a **reversal on the Solicitor General's terms is now held with very high confidence.** The involvement of Paul Clement is a strong indicator that the petitioners will have made it easy for the Court to adopt the SG's \"middle way.\" Clement's objective is to win, and he would almost certainly recognize that the SG has provided the most viable path to securing five votes for a reversal. He would likely frame the SG's position not as a compromise, but as a sensible application of the proximate cause principles his clients have been advocating for all along. This makes the SG's framework an even more probable landing spot for a majority opinion.",
          "design_beliefs": "This cycle of \"failed search leading to critical metadata\" has powerfully validated my evolving research methodology. The importance of precision and understanding the human actors in the legal process has been highlighted.\n\n1.  **Foundational Beliefs (Stable):** **Categorizing the legal question** and **analyzing primary source documents** remain the bedrock of my process.\n\n2.  **Information Retrieval Strategy (Major Refinement & Validation):**\n    *   **\"Treat Search Failures as Data\" (Strongly Validated):** This heuristic has proven its immense value. A search that failed to return a substantive document instead returned metadata (a filing date and, crucially, an email address) that unlocked the next, more critical, layer of analysis.\n    *   **\"Identify and Target the Correct Counsel of Record\" (Validated and Elevated):** This heuristic, formulated in the last step, is now confirmed as a non-negotiable principle. My initial searches were inefficient because I was targeting the wrong attorney. Future searches for party briefs will begin by identifying the correct counsel of record.\n    *   **\"Differentiate Procedural from Substantive Filings\" (Validated):** The previous observation of an \"Affidavit of Service\" reinforces the need to craft searches that isolate the substantive legal arguments from the procedural docket-fillers.\n\n3.  **Source Prioritization (Refined):**\n    *   **\"Acquire the Cert-Stage and Merits-Stage Trilogies\" (Stable):** This goal remains, but my ability to execute it is now much higher. I know the final document's filing date and its likely author, which will make the search for it far more effective.\n    *   **\"The SG's Position is a Two-Stage Signal\" (Stable):** This remains a core heuristic for understanding the executive branch's influence on the Court.\n\n4.  **Argument Analysis (Major New Heuristic):**\n    *   **\"Model the SG's Strategic Journey\" (Stable).**\n    *   **\"Weigh the Significance of a Cert Grant Over SG Opposition\" (Stable).**\n    *   **(New Heuristic) \"Analyze the Counsel of Record as a Strategic Signal\":** The identity of the advocates is a powerful piece of data. Elite Supreme Court litigators like Paul Clement have well-known strategic tendencies, reputations, and levels of credibility with the Court. His involvement suggests a pragmatic, sophisticated argument aimed at building a majority coalition. Future predictions must incorporate an analysis of the key attorneys, not just the arguments in a vacuum.\n\n5.  **Process Methodology (Validated):** The **\"Integrate-Reflect-Plan\"** cycle is working perfectly. The previous \"Reflect\" step correctly diagnosed a flawed search strategy. The resulting internal reasoning (\"THINK\" action) processed that reflection and produced a new, highly-targeted \"Plan\": search for the reply brief using Paul Clement's name. This demonstrates the power of a structured, iterative learning process."

          "task_beliefs": "The fundamental structure of my prediction remains intact, but this observation has provided a critical piece of the case's history\u2014the Solicitor General's initial, detailed argument against granting review. This deepens my understanding of the strategic shifts that have occurred and reinforces the significance of the Court's decision to take the case.\n\n1.  **The Three Competing Frameworks (Stable):** The case remains a contest between the Petitioners' \"proximate cause\" test, the Respondents' broad \"effects-based\" NEPA interpretation, and the Solicitor General's \"middle way\" focused on agency control and reasonable foreseeability. This new document provides the SG's original, full-throated defense of the Respondents' position, making the SG's later pivot to a \"middle way\" even more strategically significant.\n\n2.  **The Court's Motivation (Reinforced and Deepened):** Having now seen the SG's detailed and forceful Brief in Opposition (BIO), the Court's decision to grant certiorari appears even more deliberate. The SG argued compellingly that there was no circuit split and that the D.C. Circuit correctly applied this Court's precedent in *Department of Transp. v. Public Citizen*. The Court's grant *over* this specific, well-reasoned opposition strongly signals that a majority of justices were unpersuaded and are determined to rein in the D.C. Circuit's approach to NEPA analysis.\n\n3.  **Procedural Timeline and Key Actors (Updated):**\n    *   **Document Acquired:** I have acquired the SG's cert-stage Brief in Opposition. This is a key primary source document that I was previously missing.\n    *   **Paul Clement (Stable):** His role as the petitioners' lead counsel remains a critical variable, but my search for his reply brief was unsuccessful.\n    *   **Solicitor General's Position (Major Refinement):** I now have the \"before\" picture of the SG's strategic journey. The BIO argues that the D.C. Circuit's ruling was correct and consistent with *Public Citizen* because the Surface Transportation Board (STB), unlike other agencies in similar cases (e.g., FERC), possesses broad statutory authority under the \"public convenience and necessity\" standard to deny a project based on its environmental harms. The SG explicitly states the STB *does* have the \"ability to prevent\" the downstream effects, making analysis mandatory. This detailed legal argument provides the baseline from which the SG later strategically retreated in the merits-stage brief.\n\n4.  **The Unresolved Question (Stable and Higher Priority):** My primary uncertainty\u2014how Paul Clement's reply brief frames the petitioners' final argument\u2014remains unresolved. The search for this document failed. This failure makes obtaining the reply brief an even higher priority, as it contains the petitioners' direct response to the SG's \"middle way\" and is their final chance to persuade the Court before oral argument.\n\n**Updated Prediction:** My prediction of a **reversal on the Solicitor General's \"middle way\" terms remains held with very high confidence.** This observation reinforces the prediction. The strength of the SG's initial opposition, followed by the Court's grant of cert, makes a simple affirmance of the D.C. Circuit's broad ruling highly unlikely. The Court is acting to correct what it sees as an overreach. The SG's subsequent pivot to a narrower, compromise position provides the Court with a well-reasoned, institutionally-backed off-ramp to achieve that correction without adopting the petitioners' most aggressive \"proximate cause\" test. The path of least resistance for a majority opinion is still the one paved by the SG's merits brief.\n\n***",
          "design_beliefs": "This observation cycle was a crucial lesson in the fallibility of tools and the need to interpret search failures as data about the search mechanism itself, not just the absence of a document. My methodology is becoming more robust by learning to diagnose and adapt to the specific behaviors of my information-gathering tools.\n\n1.  **Foundational Beliefs (Stable):** **Categorizing the legal question** and **analyzing primary source documents** remain the core of my methodology. This observation added a key primary source (the SG's BIO) to my analysis.\n\n2.  **Information Retrieval Strategy (Major Refinement):**\n    *   **\"Treat Search Failures as Data\" (Strongly Validated):** My targeted search for the \"Paul Clement reply brief\" failed to return that document. However, it returned the SG's BIO. This is not a null result; it's a signal.\n    *   **(New Heuristic) \"Analyze Search Failures for Algorithmic Behavior\":** The failure indicates that my search tool likely operates on semantic similarity rather than precise keyword matching. The query's terms (\"brief,\" case name) were sufficient to retrieve a related, high-importance brief from the same case, even though the author and procedural posture were incorrect. This means I cannot assume my queries will be interpreted literally. Future searches must be designed with this semantic behavior in mind, possibly by using more restrictive filters or anticipating the need to sift through related, but inexact, results.\n    *   **\"Identify and Target the Correct Counsel of Record\" (Stable but Nuanced):** The heuristic remains valid, but its execution is tool-dependent. The strategy of using the lead counsel's name is sound, but I must now account for how my specific search tool processes that input.\n\n3.  **Source Prioritization (Refined and Progress Made):**\n    *   **\"Acquire the Cert-Stage and Merits-Stage Trilogies\" (Progress):** This goal is reinforced. I have now successfully acquired a key piece of the cert-stage trilogy: the Brief in Opposition. This fills a significant gap in my understanding of the case's early development.\n    *   **\"The SG's Position is a Two-Stage Signal\" (Strongly Validated):** This heuristic has been proven essential. Having the actual BIO document allows for a direct, line-by-line comparison with the SG's later merits brief, making the strategic shift tangible and analyzable.\n\n4.  **Argument Analysis (Refined):**\n    *   **\"Model the SG's Strategic Journey\" (Strongly Validated):** This is no longer an abstract principle; I am actively executing it. I have the explicit \"Point A\" (the BIO) and can now more accurately model the path to \"Point B\" (the merits brief), which is crucial for predicting the Court's final landing spot.\n    *   **\"Weigh the Significance of a Cert Grant Over SG Opposition\" (Validated).**\n    *   **\"Analyze the Counsel of Record as a Strategic Signal\" (Stable):** This remains a key heuristic, though its application in information retrieval requires more nuance.\n\n5.  **Process Methodology (Validated):** The **\"Integrate-Reflect-Plan\"** cycle continues to prove its worth. I integrated a new document, reflected on the failure of my search action, and have now formulated a more sophisticated understanding of my tools that will inform my next plan. The goal remains to find the petitioners' reply brief, but the tactical approach will now be adjusted based on this new knowledge."

          "task_beliefs": "This observation provided no new substantive information about the legal arguments or facts of the case. My understanding of the core legal conflict, the strategic positioning of the parties, and the likely outcome remains stable. The primary effect of this observation is to heighten the significance of the information I still lack.\n\n1.  **The Three Competing Frameworks (Stable):** The case remains a contest between the Petitioners' \"proximate cause\" test, the Respondents' broad \"effects-based\" NEPA interpretation, and the Solicitor General's \"middle way\" focused on agency control and reasonable foreseeability. This observation did not provide any new details on these frameworks.\n\n2.  **The Court's Motivation (Stable):** My belief that the Court granted certiorari to rein in the D.C. Circuit's broad NEPA interpretation, especially after seeing the SG's forceful initial opposition, remains unchanged. This observation did not alter that calculus.\n\n3.  **Procedural Timeline and Key Actors (Stable with Minor Corroboration):**\n    *   **Documents Acquired:** This search was a failure. It returned three \"Affidavit of Service\" documents, not the substantive brief I was seeking.\n    *   **Counsel of Record (Corroborated):** The affidavits confirm that Paul Clement is counsel for the Petitioners, William Jay for Eagle County, and Elizabeth Prelogar for the United States. This is consistent with my prior knowledge.\n    *   **Solicitor General's Position (Stable):** My refined understanding of the SG's two-stage strategic journey (from the cert-stage BIO to the merits brief) is unaffected.\n\n4.  **The Unresolved Question (Stable and Critical):** The central uncertainty in my model is the content of the Petitioners' reply brief. This search action failed to resolve it. This second consecutive failure makes this information gap even more critical. The reply brief represents Paul Clement's final written argument to the Court, where he would have responded directly to the SG's \"middle way\" proposal. Without it, I am missing a key piece of the strategic puzzle just before oral argument.\n\n**Updated Prediction:** My prediction of a **reversal on the Solicitor General's \"middle way\" terms remains held with very high confidence.** This observation, being a null result in terms of new evidence, does not change the prediction or the confidence level. The existing evidence\u2014the Court granting cert over the SG's strong objection and the SG then providing a carefully constructed \"off-ramp\"\u2014still points overwhelmingly toward this outcome. The lack of the reply brief is a significant blind spot, but it does not yet outweigh the strong signals from the documents I do possess.\n\n***",
          "design_beliefs": "This observation cycle was another powerful lesson in the limitations of my information-gathering tools. While providing no task-level information, it was rich with design-level data, forcing a significant refinement of my information retrieval strategy. My methodology is evolving from simply using a tool to actively diagnosing and compensating for its specific flaws.\n\n1.  **Foundational Beliefs (Stable):** **Categorizing the legal question** and **analyzing primary source documents** remain the core of my methodology. The frustration of this search failure reinforces the absolute necessity of obtaining those primary sources.\n\n2.  **Information Retrieval Strategy (Major Refinement & New Heuristics):**\n    *   **\"Treat Search Failures as Data\" (Strongly Validated):** This is now a cornerstone principle. Two consecutive failures on the same target have provided a wealth of information about my search tool's behavior.\n    *   **\"Analyze Search Failures for Algorithmic Behavior\" (Refined):** My diagnosis of the tool's behavior is now more sophisticated.\n        *   Previous cycle: The tool uses semantic matching, not just keyword matching.\n        *   Current cycle: The tool also suffers from **low precision** and **indexes low-value procedural documents**. It matched the case name and the word \"brief\" (from the text \"ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONDENTS\u2019 BRIEF\" within the affidavit) but was unable to distinguish a substantive legal brief from a procedural affidavit of service.\n    *   **(New Heuristic) \"Distinguish Substantive vs. Procedural Documents\":** I must now actively filter search results for relevance. Affidavits of service, certificates of compliance, and other procedural filings are noise. Substantive documents include petitions, briefs in opposition, reply briefs, merits briefs, and amicus briefs. Future analysis must prioritize the latter and quickly discard the former.\n    *   **(New Heuristic) \"Vary Query Specificity to Overcome Precision Failures\":** Since a highly specific query for the \"Reply Brief for Petitioners\" is failing, my next step should be to try a broader query (e.g., just the case name or docket number) and manually sift through a larger, noisier result set. The target document may be indexed incorrectly, and a broader net is required to find it.\n\n3.  **Source Prioritization (Refined and Stalled):**\n    *   **\"Acquire the Cert-Stage and Merits-Stage Trilogies\" (Progress Stalled):** This goal remains paramount. I have the Petition for Cert, the Brief in Opposition, and the SG's Merits Brief. I am critically missing the Petitioners' Reply Brief (cert stage) and the Petitioners' Merits Brief. The current tool is proving to be a significant obstacle to completing this collection.\n    *   **\"The SG's Position is a Two-Stage Signal\" (Strongly Validated):** This remains one of the most powerful analytical heuristics I have developed for this task.\n\n4.  **Argument Analysis (Stable):**\n    *   **\"Model the SG's Strategic Journey\" (Validated).**\n    *   **\"Weigh the Significance of a Cert Grant Over SG Opposition\" (Validated).**\n    *   **\"Analyze the Counsel of Record as a Strategic Signal\" (Validated).**\n\n5.  **Process Methodology (Validated):** The **\"Integrate-Reflect-Plan\"** cycle is working perfectly. I integrated a null-content observation, reflected deeply on *why* the search failed, and have now planned a set of new, more robust search heuristics to overcome the diagnosed limitations of my tools. The immediate goal is still to find the petitioners' reply brief, but my tactical approach must now account for a search tool that is both imprecise and cluttered with procedural noise."

Harris \nClerk \nSupreme Court of the United States \nWashington, D.C. 20543 \n \n \n \nRe: Seven County Infrastructure Coalition, et al. v. Eagle County,  \nColorado, et al., No. 23-975 \n \nDear Mr. Harris: \n \n \nOn December 10, 2024, this Court held oral argument on the above-captioned case, which \nconcerns the proper application of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA), Pub. \nL. No. 91-190, 83 Stat. 852 (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.).  NEPA requires federal agencies to prepare \nan environmental impact statement in connection with a proposal for \u201cmajor Federal actions \nsignificantly affecting the quality of the human environment.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C).  In this case, \npetitioners challenge the court of appeals\u2019 determination that the Surface Transportation Board \n(Board) failed to satisfy NEPA\u2019s requirements in preparing the environmental impact statement \nsupporting the Board\u2019s decision to authorize the construction of a railway line connecting the Uinta \nBasin with the national rail network in Utah.  The federal respondents filed briefs on the merits \nsupporting petitioners.  Although those briefs focused on the proper interpretation of the statutory \ntext and this Court\u2019s precedents, they also cited and discussed NEPA regulations promulgated by \nthe Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) to \u201creinforce\u201d the federal respondents\u2019 position.  \nFed. Resp. Opening Br. 29.  CEQ began promulgating its NEPA regulations at the direction of \nExecutive Order 11,991, issued by President Carter on May 24, 1977. \n \n \nBecause of federal respondent\u2019s invocation of the CEQ regulations, we wish to inform the \nCourt that, on January 20, 2025, President Trump issued an Executive Order rescinding Executive \nOrder 11,991.  See White House, Presidential Actions, Unleashing American Energy, Executive \nOrder, \u00a7 5, available at https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/unleashing-\namerican-energy/.  The new Executive Order also provides that \u201cwithin 30 days of the date of this \norder, the Chairman of [CEQ] shall provide guidance on implementing [NEPA] and propose \nrescinding CEQ\u2019s NEPA regulations found at 40 CFR 1500 et seq.\u201d  Ibid.   \n \nI would appreciate it if you would circulate this letter to Members of the Court.   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSincerely, \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSarah Harris \n \n \n \n \n \n \nActing Solicitor General \ncc: \nSee Attached Service List \n\n23-0975\nSEVEN COUNTY INFRASTRUCTURE COALITION,\nET AL.\nEAGLE COUNTY, COLORADO, ET AL.\nJ.

Harris \nClerk \nSupreme Court of the United States \n1 First Street NE \nWashington, D.C. 20543 \n \n \nRe: \nSeven County Infrastructure Coalition v. Eagle County, No. 23-975 \nDear Mr. Harris: \nRespondents Eagle County, Colorado and the Center for Biological Diversity, et \nal. seek to extend by 30 days their time for responding to the petition in this case. \nThis Court has already granted one 30-day extension, so that responses are \ncurrently due May 6, 2024. Petitioners would consent to an extension of 14 days, \nuntil May 20, 2024. Beyond that, Petitioners oppose an extension. \nPetitioner Seven County Infrastructure Coalition is a public interlocal entity \ncomprising seven counties in eastern Utah. Its board meets publicly once-a-month \nto plan its programs and expenditures. Because the rail line at issue here is a key \npart of Seven County\u2019s work, its planning will become substantially more difficult if \nthe Court cannot consider this petition before recessing for the summer, as would \nhappen if the full extension were granted. If instead responses are due by May 20, \nPetitioners could waive the usual 14-day waiting period under Rule 15.5, allowing \nthe petition to be distributed on May 28 for consideration at the June 13 conference. \nThe petition in this case was filed March 4, 2024. Having already received one \n30-day extension, Respondents\u2019 current total response time is 63 days. An \nadditional 14-day extension would give them 77 days to respond. Petitioners respect \nRespondents\u2019 need to coordinate and that Respondents\u2019 counsel have competing \nobligations. But 11 weeks is a reasonable amount of time for a response even in the \nface of the scheduling issues noted in the second extension request. \nFor all these reasons, Petitioners oppose an extension beyond May 20, 2024. \n\n \nHonorable Scott S.

Unlike most of the petitions for writ \nof certiorari this Court receives, the Court need not \nrely upon arguments of counsel to determine that this \nconflict exists: the circuits themselves acknowledge \nthat they are in conflict. E.g., Ctr. for Biol. Diversity v. \nU.S. Army Corps of Eng\u2019rs, 941 F.3d 1288, 1299-1300 \n(11th Cir. 2019) (discussing the conflict). \n \nThe United States Court of Appeals for the Dis-\ntrict of Columbia Circuit has adopted the minority po-\nsition on this conflict. Id. (noting that the D.C. Circuit \nis an \u201coutlier\u201d). The Eleventh Circuit further noted \nthat the \u201clegal analysis [of the two-judge majority in \nthe D.C. Circuit decision in Sierra Club v. FERC, 867 \nF.3d 1357 (D.C. Cir. 2017)] is questionable at best. It \nfails to take seriously the rule of reason announced in \nPublic Citizen or to account for the untenable conse-\nquences of its decision.\u201d Id. at 1300. The Eleventh Cir-\ncuit agreed with the strong dissent in Sierra Club. Id. \nat 1300. \n \nHere, Petitioners applied for authorization of a \nspur railroad line into the Uintah Basin in Utah. That \nrailroad would dramatically improve the economy and \n\n3 \nthe lives of the Ute Indian Tribe and others who live in \nthe Uintah Basis. The application was submitted to the \nSurface Transportation Board (STB), and the STB did \n\u201ctake seriously\u201d this Court\u2019s holding in Public Citizen. \nThe STB properly limited its NEPA analysis to its im-\nportant but narrow role within the federal govern-\nment. Its decision was proper under Public Citizen and \nwould be proper in the majority of the circuits which \nhave reached the issue. But the D.C. Circuit held the \nSTB should have gone much further, far afield from the \nSTB\u2019s limited role in the federal government, invading \nthe province of other federal and state agencies and in-\nvading the province of the legislative branch regarding \nnational energy policy. \n \nBecause a large percentage of NEPA cases can be \nfiled in the District of Columbia, the D.C. Circuit\u2019s er-\nroneous decision is the de facto rule that agencies now \nmust follow throughout the United States. \n \nThis Court should grant the petition and deter-\nmine whether the D.C. Circuit\u2019s minority position is \ncorrect. \n--------------------------------- \u2666 --------------------------------- \n \nARGUMENT \nI. \nLegal and factual background \n \nThe Ute Indian Tribe seeks to provide govern-\nmental services for its members and for its large but \nsparsely populated reservation. It seeks to provide \nhealth care, education, housing, and other services. See \n\n4 \ngenerally Utetribe.com (listing and describing tribal \nprograms and services). Unlike other governments, it \ncannot effectively pay for services through tax receipts. \nEven if it wanted to, its lands are too sparsely popu-\nlated to provide much income from tourism, gaming, or \nsimilar activities. \n \nWhat it does have, by fate or good luck, is substan-\ntial quantities of superior waxy crude oil. But by fate \nor bad luck, it does not have the same access to mar-\nkets as other oil fields in the United States. Gaining \nthat access would improve the income of the Tribe and \nits members. As discussed below, the Tribe would have \ngained that access under the court decisions in the ma-\njority of the circuits which have reached the issues. \n \nThe three Bands that make up the Ute Indian \nTribe of the Uintah and Ouray Reservation (the Uin-\ntah, White River, and Uncompahgre Bands) originally \noccupied the land between present day Denver and \nSalt Lake. The Uintah Band occupied land in present \nday Utah, including land in the Uintah Basin in north-\neastern Utah. The White River and Uncompahgre \nBands occupied northwestern and central western \nColorado (including all the land now in Eagle County, \nColorado). \n \nFollowing the Meeker Incident in 1879, the non-\nIndian Coloradans, led by Colorado Governor Fred-\nerick Pitkin adopted the rallying cry \u201cThe Utes Must \nGo!,\u201d2 asserting the United States should forcibly \n \n \n2 Governor Pitkin did not care whether \u201cgo\u201d meant \u201cgo by \nforce from Colorado\u201d or whether it meant extermination. E.g., \n \n\n5 \nremove the Uncompahgre and White River Bands from \nColorado. Peter R. Decker, \u201cThe Utes Must Go!\u201d: Amer-\nican Expansion and the Removal of a People, ch. 6 \n(2004). \n \nOne reason Coloradans wanted the White River \nand Uncompahgre Bands removed or exterminated \nwas to open land for the main line east-to-west railroad \nrelevant to this case\u2014the railroad through Eagle \nCounty Colorado. Pitkin to Jay Gould (Oct. 23, 1879) \n(quoted in \u201cThe Utes Must Go!\u201d, 149). Eagle County \nColorado and the coalition of environmental groups \naligned with them now have the audacity and shame-\nlessness to assert that permitting oil, agricultural \nproducts, or anything else that a common carrier rail-\nroad might transport from present-day Ute lands to \npass over that very same rail line is a great ill which \nmust be prevented. \n \nThe Executive Branch, in defiance of the Act of \nJune 15, 1880,3 21 Stat. 199, forcibly marched the \nBands from Colorado to the Uintah Valley Reservation \nin Utah and an adjoining replacement Reservation for \n \nPitkin to Carl Schurtz (Oct. 12, 1879) (quoted in \u201cThe Utes Must \nGo!\u201d, 147). \n \n3 In the Act of June 15, 1880, Congress took the Tribe\u2019s \u201cper-\nmanent\u201d reservation, created just more than a decade earlier, and \ndirected the Executive Branch to create a replacement reserva-\ntion for the Uncompahgre Band around the present-day location \nof Grand Junction, Colorado if land in that area was cultivable. \nThere was and is such cultivable lands in that area, but the Ex-\necutive Branch, at the urging of Colorado, created the replace-\nment reservation on non-cultivable lands in Utah. \n\n6 \nthe Uncompahgre Band in Utah. Ute Indian Tribe v. \nUtah, 790 F.3d 1000 (10th Cir. 2015). \n \nThe area from which the non-Indians forced the \nUtes now contains common carrier rail lines, interstate \nroadways, commercial airports, cities, oil and hard \nmineral producing lands, fertile agricultural lands, etc. \nIt contains substantial oil fields and agricultural lands \nthat are connected to the United States rail infrastruc-\nture. It is firmly tied to the United States economic and \ntransportation infrastructure. \n \nAll of Eagle County, Colorado was originally Ute \nlands. The unemployment rate in Eagle County is un-\nder 3%.4 Eagle County includes Vail, Colorado, where \naverage home prices are over $2,000,000.5 It also in-\ncludes Minturn, named after the vice president of the \nrailroad company that brought a rail line to that town \nand others in the area.6 \n \nIn contrast, the Uintah Basin has to date proven \ntoo remote and too difficult to access. It has one two \nlane road from east to west, an airport with only two \nsmall commercial flights per day, no rail access, no ski \nresorts or chalets for the rich and famous. From some \nparts of the Uintah Basin, it is a three-hour drive, in \ngood weather, to the nearest four lane road. \n \n \n4 https://vailvalleymeansbusiness.com/data-center/d (last vis-\nited April 2, 2024). \n \n5 https://www.redfin.com/city/20103/CO/Vail/housing-market \n(last visited April 2, 2024). \n \n6 https://www.minturn.org/historic-preservation/pages/timelines \n(last visited April 2, 2024). \n \n\n7 \n \nThe United States and Colorado knew that much \nof the Uintah Basin was and would remain a remote \nhigh desert. Before the United States permitted a res-\nervation to be established in the Uintah Basin,7 the \nUtah Territorial Indian Superintendent dispatched a \nsurvey term to determine whether the proposed reser-\nvation lands would be suitable for non-Indian settle-\nment. The team\u2019s \u201cunanimous and firm\u201d verdict was \nthat the proposed reservation lands were \u201cone vast \n\u2018contiguity of waste,\u2019 and measurably valueless, except \nfor nomadic purposes, hunting grounds for Indians and \nto hold the world together.\u201d Report of Utah Expedi-\ntion, printed in Deseret News, Sept. 25, 1961, quoted \nin Charles Wilkinson, Fire on the Plateau, 150 (Island \nPress 2004). See also U.S. Department of the Interior, \nAnnual Report of the Commissioner of Indian Af-\nfairs to the Secretary of the Interior for the Year 1886, \n225 (\u201cThe Uncompahgre Reserve is a desert. Of the \n1,933,440 acres embraced therein not one can be relied \non to produce a crop without irrigation, and not more \nthan 3 per cent of the whole is susceptible of being \nmade productive by process of irrigation.\u201d). \n \nThe Tribe\u2019s Uncompahgre Reservation remains \none of the least populated areas in the United States. \nThe Uncompahgre Reservation is substantially larger \n \n \n7 The Uintah and Ouray Reservation started as two separate \nreservations: the Uintah Valley Reservation (for the Uintah and \nlater also the White River Bands) and the Uncompahgre Reser-\nvation (for the Uncompahgre Bands). Because the Uncompahgre \nReservation is virtually uninhabitable, the Reservations were \neventually combined and a single government for the three Bands \nwas created. \n\n8 \nthan the State of Delaware. There is only one census \narea on the Uncompahgre Reservation, and in the \nmost recent decennial census that census area, Bo-\nnanza, dropped from a population of one in the 2010 \ncensus to a population of zero. Emily Harris, First In-\nsights\u20142020 Census Utah Counties and Communities \n(Univ. Utah 2021). \n \nRespondents Eagle County, Colorado and its aligned \nNGOs want to keep it that way. \n \nUnbeknownst to Coloradans or the United States \nwhen the White River and Uncompahgre Bands were \nforcible removed from their Reservations in Colorado \nto land in Utah, the Uintah Valley Reservation and the \nUncompahgre Reservation in Utah contained valuable \nmineral resources. First, the United States found that \nthe lands contained Gilsonite, and Congress took that \nland from the Tribe. Act of May 24, 1888, ch. 310, 25 \nStat. 157. Later, the United States discovered the Res-\nervation contained one of the largest and best oil fields \nin the United States. By the time the United States re-\nalized the land contained oil, Congress did not have the \naudacity to take that land.8 \n \nThe United States owns most of the land on the \nTribe\u2019s Reservation. Similarly, the United States owns \nmuch of the land on all Indian Reservations and the \nUnited States owns about half of the land west of \nthe Rocky Mountains. Nearly anything occurring on \nthat federally owned land involves federal permitting, \n \n \n8 The Executive Branch did, and currently still does, have \nthat audacity, but that is a case for a later date. \n\n9 \nleasing, or other federal actions, and therefore requires \nNEPA review. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4332(C). The Tribe is not \ncomplaining about NEPA review. But, as will be dis-\ncussed below, the D.C. Circuit decision would provide \nRespondents with multiple bites at the same apple and \nwould require agencies to conduct the expansive con-\nsideration and issue their own decision, even when \nthey have no authority, jurisdiction, or expertise. \n \nBecause so much of what occurs on the Tribe\u2019s \nReservation and more generally on land west of the \nRocky Mountains involves federal action by multiple \nfederal agencies, the D.C. Circuit\u2019s decision would have \nan inordinate detrimental impact for the Tribe and \nothers living west of the Rocky Mountains. \n \nSince the early 1900s, there have been efforts to \nbuild a railroad that would connect the Uintah Valley \nto American\u2019s railway infrastructure. E.g., Robert \nAthearn, Rebel of the Rockies:  The Denver and Rio \nGrand Western Railroad (1962) (discussing plans for a \nrailroad from Denver to Salt Lake via the Uintah \nBasin); Utah Dep\u2019t Transp., Uintah Basin Railroad \nFeasibility Study Summary Report (Jan. 9, 2015) \n(hereinafter 2015 Report) (discussing a prior feasibil-\nity study for the \u201cIsolated Empire rail line\u201d in 2001). \nNone of those efforts succeeded. \n \nThe most recent effort to connect the \u201cIsolated \nEmpire\u201d to the United States rail infrastructure began \nin 2013. 2015 Report \u00a7 1.0. \n \n\n10 \nII. \nSurface Transportation Board duties and \nproceedings. \n \nThe Surface Transportation Board is an independ-\nent federal agency with a multi-member Board. There \nare approximately eighty independent federal agen-\ncies, and there are approximately seventy federal \nagencies with multi-member boards. Admin. Conf. of \nthe U.S., Sourcebook of United States Executive Agen-\ncies, tables 3, 4 (2d ed. 2018).  \n \nThe STB has a five-member Board. The Board is ap-\npointed by the President with the advice and consent \nof the Senate. 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 1301(a), (b). It is \u201ccharged \nwith the economic regulation of various modes of sur-\nface transportation, primarily freight rail.\u201d stb.gov/about-\nstb/. Because of that limited function, its members \nmust have experience in transportation, economic reg-\nulation, or business. 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 1301(b)(2). \n \nPetitioner submitted a petition for a certificate au-\nthorizing Petitioner to construct a common carrier \nspur rail line from a mainline common carrier railroad \ninto the Uintah Basin. Federal statutes provide that \nupon receipt of a petition to construct a common car-\nrier line, the STB \u201cshall issue a certificate authorizing \n[construction] unless the Board finds that such activi-\nties are inconsistent with the public convenience and \nnecessity.\u201d 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10901(a), (c). \n \nUnder long established federal law and policy, a \ncommon carrier has a statutory duty to carry any prod-\nucts. E.g., 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 11101. The STB therefore does \nnot and cannot determine what products\u2014or whose \n\n11 \nproducts\u2014a common carrier line will carry. The prod-\nucts\u2014on both the proposed spur line and on the main \nline\u2014are determined by the market. Based upon fed-\neral policy codified into statute, any person who is will-\ning to pay to have goods carried is treated on an equal \nbasis by the common carrier. \n \nCongress provided further guidance to the STB in \n49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10101, which defines, through 15 para-\ngraphs, the United States\u2019 \u201crail transportation policy.\u201d \nParagraph 4 states that the United States policy is \u201cto \nensure the development and continuation of a sound \nrail transportation system with effective competition \namong rail carriers and with other modes, to meet the \nneeds of the public and the national defense.\u201d \n \nThe State of Utah completed a preliminary feasi-\nbility study for the current proposal in 2015. 2015 Re-\nport. \n \nThe STB initiated environmental review of the \nUintah Basin Railway proposal in June 2019, and Pe-\ntitioners formally petitioned for a certificate authoriz-\ning construction in May 2020. Eagle Cnty. v. Surface \nTransp. Bd., 82 F.4th 1152, 1165 (D.C. Cir. 2023). The \nSTB issued its final decision in December 2021. Seven \nCnty. Infrastructure Coal.\u2014Rail Constr. & Operation \nExemption\u2014in Utah, Carbon, Duchesne, & Uintah \nCntys., S.T.B. Fin. Dec., Dkt. FD36284, 2021 WL \n5960905 (STB served Dec. 15, 2021). Pet. App. C.9 \n \n \n9 In contrast to the lengthy process for the 88-mile spur line, \nthe 1900-mile transcontinental railroad from Council Bluffs, Iowa \n \n\n12 \n \nThe STB provided a substantial discussion of po-\ntential environmental effects from the proposed rail \nline. But, consistent with its limited role\u2014freight rail \nand related surface transportation\u2014it properly re-\njected Respondents\u2019 assertions that the Board should \nenforce Respondent NGOs\u2019 desired energy policy un-\nder the guise of NEPA review or Respondent Eagle \nCounty\u2019s attempt to prevent the common carrier rail-\nroad passing through Eagle County from carrying \nmore crude oil. \n \nQuoting and correctly applying this Court\u2019s hold-\ning from Public Citizen v. Dept. of Justice, 491 U.S. 440, \n767-68 (1989), the STB concluded that because the \nSTB does not regulate, and in fact does not even have \n\u201cauthority or jurisdiction over development of oil and \ngas in the Basin,\u201d any conjectured future changes to \nthat development of oil and gas were not under its en-\nvironmental review authority. Pet. App. 108a. Instead, \nany such development was for some other agency or \nagencies to consider. \n \nThe STB similarly concluded that because author-\nization of construction of a common carrier railroad in \nUtah does not dictate where crude oil will ultimately \nbe refined, conjectured effect of refinement on commu-\nnities in the Gulf Coast was also not within its author-\nity. \n \n \nto the West Coast was approved by Congress in 1862, 12 Stat. \n489, construction began in 1863, and the line was completed and \nthe golden spike driven on May 10, 1869. \n\n13 \nIII. The Circuit Courts are in conflict. \n \nPetitioner provides a thorough and correct discus-\nsion of the split between the D.C. Circuit and Ninth \nCircuit on one side and the Third, Fourth, Sixth, Sev-\nenth, and Eleventh Circuits on the other side. Pet. 14-\n20. \n \nAs Petitioner shows, the split is over how far down \nthe line (non-literally10) an agency must look. Amicus \ncuriae believe Public Citizen provided a clear and eas-\nily applied answer to that question. The majority of the \ncircuits hold that an agency meets the procedural re-\nquirements for NEPA analysis, and a Court therefore \ncannot vacate and remand to the agency, if the agency \nhas adequately considered the environmental conse-\nquences which are within its regulatory authority. 11 \n \nIf the majority circuit position is correct (and it is, \nunless this Court is going to overrule its prior unani-\nmous decision in Public Citizen), then the agency was \npermitted to limit its NEPA analysis to the \u201ceffects \nproximately caused by the actions over which they \n \n \n10 The D.C. Circuit held that the agency had to consider al-\nleged possible effects long after products that could be hauled on \nthe spur line left that spur line, and even long after they left other \nrail lines 1500 or more miles away, Pet. App. 36a, and yet further \nwhen they were ultimately used by consumers, Pet. App. 35a-36a. \n \n11 The thornier issue which Public Citizen did not answer, \nand which is not presented by the current case, is: can an agency \nconsider effects which are not within its regulatory jurisdiction, \nand if so, when can it do so and when can it not do so. That thorn-\nier question would require the Court to determine when the \ncourts should bar one agency from invading the province of some \nother state, tribal, or federal agency. \n\n14 \nhave regulatory responsibility,\u201d and its decision to so \nlimit its analysis cannot be vacated by a court. \n \nApplying its very different standard, the Court be-\nlow held that the agency was required to engage in a \nwide-ranging analysis of activities that are not within \nthe STB\u2019s regulatory responsibilities, but which are \nwithin the regulatory responsibilities of other agen-\ncies. Moreover, the Court below requires the STB to \nconsider or re-consider possible effects which have been \nor will be reviewed when those other agencies conduct \nNEPA review of proposed federal actions within those \nagencies\u2019 responsibilities. \n \nFor example, the D.C. Circuit chastises the agency \nfor not reviewing how the building of the spur line into \nthe Ui\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n130: 20240712084812007_2024.07.1220Extension20Letter20to20Clerk20of20Supreme20Court.json (score: 0.326)\nJuly 12, 2024 \nt 202.344.4698 \nJCJohnson@Venable.com \n \nBY U.S. MAIL AND ELECTRONIC FILING \n \nHonorable Scott S.

[to] creat[e] such delay \nas to completely impede the progress of a project.\u201d Pet. \nBr. at 4 (citation omitted).  Petitioners\u2019 amici echo this \nrefrain, with a brief from six Senators claiming that, \nthough Congress enacted NEPA \u201c[a]s a common-sense \nstatute imposing only procedural precautions,\u201d \u201cmany \nlower court decisions\u201d have \u201ctransform[ed]\u201d the law \u201cinto \na roving environmentalist mandate.\u201d Barrasso Br. at 2\u20133.  \nThe solution, for Petitioners and their amici alike, is to \nrelegate NEPA to a \u201cmodest procedural check,\u201d Pet. Br. \nat 4; a \u201cquite modest, even minimalist\u201d Congressional \n\u201cdirective,\u201d CEA Br. at 4; and a \u201cnarrow procedure\u201d that \nagencies undertake as part of the project development \nprocess, Barrasso Br. at 4. \nOur experience as members of the legislative body \nthat has debated, modified, and updated NEPA over \nseveral decades makes clear that such characterizations \nmiss the mark. \nTo start, the path forward is not a return to some \nbygone past, of NEPA as a \u201cminimalist\u201d or \u201cmodest\u201d \nrequirement that agencies must check on their way to \nproject approval.  Those bygone days never happened, for \na simple reason:  Congress never meant for NEPA to be \na \u201cnarrow,\u201d ministerial, box-checking formality.  Barrasso \nBr. at 4.  To the contrary, NEPA became law because, \nbefore its enactment, environmental policy was \u201ctoo \nnarrow, too limited, and too specialized.\u201d National \n\n7 \n \n \nEnvironmental Policy: Hearing Before the Comm. on \nInterior and Insular Affs. on S. 1075, S. 237, and S. 1752, \n91st Cong. 27 (1969) (statement of Sen. Jackson).  There \nwas no mandate calling for interagency coordination or \ncollaboration.  What NEPA did, then, was \u201csupplement \nexisting, but narrow and fractionated, congressional \ndeclarations\u201d by establishing an \u201corderly, rational, and \nconstructive\u201d procedure for considering the environment \nin agency decision-making.  S. REP. NO. 91-296, at 9 \n(1969).  That is exactly the approach the D.C. Circuit took \nbelow, when it understood NEPA to require the Surface \nTransportation Board to assess both the upstream and \ndownstream impacts of the Uinta railway and to consult \nother agencies while doing that assessment. \nNor is this a case, as Petitioners and their amici seem \nto suggest, where Congress passed a law and then fell \nasleep at the wheel while that law metastasized into an \nunmanageable, bureaucratic roadblock.  Instead, as \nrepresentatives who have considered a myriad of NEPA \nreform bills with our colleagues, we say with confidence \nthat Congress has repeatedly enacted changes to NEPA \nand is clearly \u201caware\u201d of how the law has been interpreted \nby agencies and courts.  Cannon v. Univ. of Chicago, 441 \nU.S. 677, 697 (1979).  The many efforts\u2014successful and \nunsuccessful\u2014to legislate with that interpretation firmly \nin \nthe \nbackground \nreflect \nthat \nCongress \nhas \n\u201cacquiesce[d]\u201d \nand \n\u201caffirmed\u201d \nthe \nlong-held \nunderstanding of NEPA as embraced and applied by the \nD.C. Circuit.  Id. at 703.   \nIndeed, a careful review of these legislative efforts \ndemonstrates \nthat \nCongress \nhas \nactively \nand \ncontinuously sought to shape NEPA since its passage, \nwith more than 550 bills put forward.  Several of those \n\n8 \n \n \nbills have become law, including the Energy Policy, \nFAST, and BUILDER Acts.  But none of these laws have \naltered NEPA\u2019s fundamental mission: to require that \u201call \nFederal agencies plan and work toward meeting the \nchallenge of a better environment.\u201d  S. REP. NO. 91-296, \nat 9 (1969).  And even more tellingly, the bills that have \nfailed underscore exactly why Petitioners have come \nknocking on the wrong government door for relief.   \nSenator Mike Lee, for instance, is one of the six \nsignatories to the Petitioners-side Congressional brief.  \nHe was also the lead sponsor of an amendment to the 2024 \nConsolidated Appropriations Act.  Pub. L. 118-42, 138 \nStat. 25.  That amendment, if passed, would have \nexempted from NEPA the railroad project at issue here; \nit would have also ended this specific case and denied \nfurther judicial redress on the NEPA claims.  S. Amend. \n1111, 118th Cong., 169 CONG. REC. S4400 (daily ed. Sept. \n12, 2023).  But that effort failed.  And in the same vein, \nCongress considered various amendments to the \nBUILDER Act that would have also eviscerated NEPA \nalong the lines that Petitioners pursue here.  That effort \nwas likewise unavailing.   \nThis Court has emphasized time and again that it does \nnot \u201csit as a super-legislature and create statutory \ndistinctions where none were intended.\u201d  Sec. Indus. \nAss\u2019n v. Bd. of Gov. of Fed. Res. Sys., 468 U.S. 137, 153 \n(1984) (cleaned up); accord City of New Orleans v. Dukes, \n427 U.S. 297, 303 (1976); Day-Brite Lighting, Inc. v. \nMissouri, 342 U.S. 421, 423 (1952).  Yet that is just what \nPetitioners and their amici seek.  Congress considered, \nbut declined, to give a hall pass to the Uinta project.  It \nhas likewise considered, but declined, to restrict the scope \nof judicial review.  And even as it has adopted other \nchanges to NEPA, it has consistently rejected efforts to \n\n9 \n \n \nstrip the law of its emphasis on interagency processes and \ncoordination.  There is no reason, when Petitioners and \ntheir amici have failed at each turn to obtain their desired \nlegislative solution in a legislative forum, that they should \nnow obtain this same solution in a judicial forum.    \n \nARGUMENT \nI. CONGRESS ENACTED NEPA TO PROVIDE \nFOR \nPROACTIVE \nAND \nCOORDINATED \nENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW.   \nTo understand why Congress needed a statute like \nNEPA to require large-scale, cross-agency action, one \nneed first consider the state of environmental law pre-\nNEPA.    \nAt the time, the Clean Air Act, Water Pollution \nControl Act, and other laws offered a patchwork of \nsubstantive environmental protections.  No statute, \nthough, \u201cprovide[d] an effective or orderly manner to \nconsider all forms of environmental degradation,\u201d \nparticularly those which might cut across geography and \njurisdiction.  115 CONG. REC. 29053 (1969).  Many agencies \ndid not \u201chave a mandate within the body of their enabling \nlaws to allow them to give adequate attention to \nenvironmental values,\u201d S. REP. NO. 91-296, at 14 (1969), \nmuch less the \u201cclear authority to assure consideration of \nenvironmental factors which conflict with other Federal \nobjectives,\u201d 115 CONG. REC. 40419 (1969).    \nThe results of this blinkered approach were \npredictable.  In describing the Tennessee Valley \nAuthority (\u201cTVA\u201d), for instance, then-Interior Secretary \nStewart Udall observed that \u201ctheir mission was to \n\n10 \n \n \nproduce electric power as cheaply as possible.\u201d But he \nbemoaned where this narrow focus led the Authority; if \nsticking to this mission \u201cdestroyed resources, rivers and \nhillsides, and ruined parts of the country outside the TVA \narea for all time, this was none of their business.\u201d  Joint \nHouse-Senate Colloquium to Discuss a National Policy \nfor the Environment: Hearing Before the Comm. on \nInterior and Insular Affs. U.S. S. and the Comm. on \nScience and Astronautics U.S. H.R., 90th Cong. 15 (1968).   \nNor was the TVA some unique creature of federal law.  \n\u201cMany of the environmental controversies\u201d of the day \nwere \u201ccaused by the failure to consider all relevant points \nof view in the planning and conduct of Federal activities,\u201d \nS. REP. NO. 91-296, at 20 (1969), with the unintended, \nenvironmental impacts following a major California oil \nspill serving as the lynchpin behind NEPA\u2019s drafting and \nultimate passage, Teresa Sabol Spezio, The Santa \nBarbara Oil Spill and Its Effect on United States \nEnvironmental Policy, 10 Sustainability 2750 (2018).    \nThus, when introducing the Act, lead sponsor Henry \nJackson chided lawmakers for constantly \u201creacting to \ncrisis situations in the environmental field.\u201d Richard F. \nWeingroff, Addressing the Quiet Crisis: Origins of the \nNational Environmental Policy Act of 1969, U.S. Dep\u2019t \nof Transp., Fed. Highway Admin. (Jan. 15, 2009), \nhttps://perma.cc/P2XC-EADF.  \u201cWhat we should be \ndoing,\u201d Jackson underscored, \u201cis setting up institutions \nand procedures designed to anticipate environmental \nproblems before they reach the crisis stage.\u201d Id. \nOther members of Congress shared that view:    \nenvironmental disasters should no longer be \u201cthe spinoff, \nthe fallout, and the unanticipated consequence[]\u201d of \u201cthe \npursuit of narrower, more immediate goals.\u201d S. REP. NO. \n\n11 \n \n \n91-296, at 9 (1969).   Instead, because \u201c[e]nvironmental \nproblems \ncut \nacross \nmany \nexisting \noperational \norganizations\u201d and thus cannot be in \u201cthe exclusive \nbailiwick of any committee of Congress nor department of \nGovernment,\u201d NEPA would provide \u201call agencies and all \nFederal officials with a legislative mandate and a \nresponsibility to consider the consequences of their \nactions on the environment.\u201d  CONGRESSIONAL WHITE \nPAPER ON A NATIONAL POLICY FOR THE ENVIRONMENT \n12 (Comm. Print. 1968); 115 CONG. REC. 40423 (1969); S. \nREP. NO 91-296, at 14 (1969).  Rather than operating in \nnarrowly \ndrawn \nsilos, \nagencies \nwould \ntake \nan \n\u201cinterdisciplinary, \nteam \napproach\u201d \nto \nassess \nthe \nconsequences of federal development projects.  115 CONG. \nREC. 29085 (1969). \nThe contemporaneous legislative record affirms the \nimportance of and need for interagency coordination, both \nfor NEPA generally and for the Environmental Impact \nStatement (\u201cEIS\u201d) specifically.  Section 101(a), for \nexample, declares that \u201cthe activities and resources of the \nFederal Government shall be improved and coordinated \nto . . . attain certain broad national goals in the \nmanagement of the environment.\u201d 115 CONG. REC. 29084 \n(1969).  Section 101(b)(4) similarly repudiates the \nunderstanding that \u201cenvironmental evaluation\u201d should be \nrestricted to \u201cthe province of a particular agency.\u201d  115 \nCONG. REC. 29085 (1969). And section 102(2)\u2019s \u201caction-\nforcing\u201d mechanism\u2014the provision at issue here\u2014ties \nthese provisions together, requiring that agencies work \ntogether \u201clest legislation does not matter.\u201d National \nEnvironmental Policy: Hearing Before the Comm. on \nInterior and Insular Affs. on S. 1075, S. 237, and S. 1752, \n91st Cong. 116 (1969) (statement of Sen. Jackson).   \nCongress, in sum, enacted NEPA not as some pro forma \n\n12 \n \n \ncheck, but as a meaningful and responsive mandate for \ninteragency cooperation and coordination.    \n \nII. CONGRESS \nCONTINUES \nTO \nEMBRACE \nNEPA\u2019S HOLISTIC APPROACH.  \nIn addition to glossing over the circumstances \nmotivating NEPA\u2019s passage, Petitioners and their amici \ncommit a second, related misstep.  Several of our Senate \ncounterparts claim that Congress \u201ccould not have \nanticipated\u201d or \u201cpredicted\u201d what NEPA would look like \ntoday: i.e., a coordinated, proactive, and interagency \neffort to assess the environmental impacts of federal \ndevelopment, with the backstop of meaningful judicial \nreview.  Barrasso Br. at 5\u20136.  Petitioners make a \nsubstantially similar claim.   Pet. Br. at 4.  But this \ncharacterization of Congressional intent has little basis in \neither law or fact.  Congress has often amended NEPA\u2014\nbut it has always left Petitioners\u2019 proposed changes on the \ncutting-room floor.   \nA. Congress has actively changed NEPA and \nsought to \nshape \nits \ncontours \nsince \nits \nenactment. \nAs this Court has outlined, \u201cCongress\u2019 acquiescence to \na settled judicial interpretation can suggest adoption of \nthat interpretation.\u201d AMG Cap. Mgmt, LLC v. Fed. Trade \nComm\u2019n, 593 U.S. 67, 81 (2021) (citing Monesson Sw. R. \nCo. v. Morgan, 486 U.S. 330, 338 (1988)).  To be sure, \n\u201cwhen Congress has not comprehensively revised a \nstatutory scheme but has made only isolated amendments \nit is impossible to assert with any degree of assurance that \ncongressional failure to act represents affirmative \n\n13 \n \n \ncongressional \napproval \nof \na \ncourt\u2019s \nstatutory \ninterpretation.\u201d Id. (cleaned up).    \nHere, however, there are far more than the one or two \nexamples of acquiescence which the Court examined and \nsubsequently rejected in AMG Capital, 593 U.S. at 82, \nSolid Waste Agency of Northern Cook County v. U.S. \nArmy Corps of Engineers, 531 U.S. 159, 170 (2001), and \nother cases.    \nThat is because since NEPA\u2019s passage, Congress has \nintroduced at least 550 bills that seek to modify, amend, \nor update the statute in some way.  See Appendix.  In 1970, \nthe first year following NEPA\u2019s passage, Congress \nintroduced ten such bills alone.  In each year since, \nmembers of the House or Senate (and, in many years, \nboth) have proposed\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n51: 20240410153500434_Joint20Request20for20Extension20of20Time.json (score: 0.320)\nApril 10, 2024 \nHonorable Scott S. Harris, Clerk \nSupreme Court of the Unted States \nWashington, D.C.  20543 \nRe: \nLetter Motion for Extension of Time to File Opposition to Petition for a Writ of \nCertiorari, Seven County Infrastructure Coalition, et al., Petitioners, v. Eagle County, \nColorado, et al., Respondents, No. 23-975 \nDear Mr. Harris: \nRespondent Eagle County, Colorado (Eagle County) and Respondents Center for Biological \nDiversity, et al. (the Center) request an extension of time to file a joint opposition to the Seven \nCounty Infrastructure Coalition, et al.\u2019s (the Coalition) petition for a writ of certiorari in the \nabove-captioned case, which was docketed on March 6, 2024.  The original deadline for \nresponses to the petition was April 5.  On March 26, the Court granted the Solicitor General\u2019s \nrequest to extend that deadline for responses to May 6, which applies to all respondents. \nPursuant to Rule 30.4, Eagle County and the Center respectfully request that the time for filing \nresponses be extended by an additional 30 days, to and including June 5, 2024.  Eagle County \nand the Center require additional time to respond to the petition, and to the seven (7) amicus \nbriefs filed in support of the petition on April 5.  In an effort to preserve judicial resources, Eagle \nCounty and the Center intend to file a single, joint brief in opposition which requires significant \ncoordination and review among the counsel for Eagle County and the Center.   \nAn extension is also necessary because of counsels\u2019 existing schedules.  Counsel of record for \nEagle County Nathaniel Hunt must complete conflicting, existing litigation deadlines.  On \nApril 8 through 12, counsel of record for the Center Wendy Park is scheduled to attend a staff \nretreat and case-related field trip, which were both planned months in advance.  In addition, Ms. \nPark has a motion deadline on April 26 in Coalition for Sonoran Desert Protection v. Federal \nHighway Administration, No. 4:22-cv-00193-JCH (D. Az.), in which the parties are still \nnegotiating issues to avoid a motion; and a May 6 public comment deadline for an agency action \non remand in Center for Biological Diversity v. U.S. Forest Service, No. 2:17-cv-00372-MHW-\nKAJ (S.D. Ohio), which comments are necessary to exhaust administrative remedies.  Ms. Park \nis lead counsel in both of these cases.  During the week of April 15, Ms. Park has been tasked \n\nHonorable Scott S. Harris \nApril 10, 2024 \nPage 2 of 2 \nwith reviewing a draft response (due April 26) to several motions to dismiss totaling over 160 \npages in Utah Physicians for a Healthy Environment v.

The Court analogized \nthis requirement to the \u201cfamiliar doctrine of \nproximate cause from tort law.\u201d\n . . . \n[W]here an agency has no ability to prevent \na certain effect due to its limited statutory \nauthority over the relevant actions, the agency \ncannot be considered a legally relevant \u201ccause\u201d \nof the effect. Hence, under NEPA and the \nimplementing CEQ regulations, the agency \nneed not consider these effects in its EA[.]\nFor the past 138 years the Surface Transportation \nBoard (STB) and its predecessor have not had statutory \nauthority to determine the shippers who can access a \ncommon carrier rail line or the products that can be \nshipped on a common carrier rail line. Common carriers \nare required to haul all products\u2014whether solar panels \nor oil, products from rural areas or urban, without \ndiscrimination.\n\n3\nBut the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia \nCircuit held that when the STB was deciding whether to \nauthorize an 88-mile common carrier spur line, the STB \nwas required to prognosticate how and where the spur \nOLQH\u0003ZRXOG\u0003LPSDFW\u0003RLO\u0003SURGXFWLRQ\u0003DQG\u0003RLO\u0003UH\u00c0QLQJ\u0011\u00038QGHU\u0003\nthe D.C.

Circuit\u2019s decision was directly and unquestionably \ncontrary to this Court\u2019s prior decisions. Unless this \nCourt is going to overturn its prior unanimous statutory \ninterpretation decision in Public Citizen, this Court must \nvacate the D.C. Court\u2019s decision.\nThis Court should reiterate that when an agency has \n\u201cno ability to prevent a certain effect due to its limited \nstatutory authority,\u201d Public Citizen, 541 U.S. at 770, the \nagency need not consider that effect. Where the agency \nhas considered the effects that are within that agency\u2019s \nstatutory authority, that is the end of the judicial inquiry, \nand the agency\u2019s decision withstands NEPA review.\n\n4\nARGUMENT\nI.  Legal and factual background\nA.  The need for and benefit from a common \ncarrier rail line into the Uintah Basin.\nThe Ute Indian Tribe provides governmental services \nfor its members and for its large but sparsely populated \nreservation. It provides health care, education, housing, \nand other services. See generally utetribe.com (listing \nand describing tribal programs and services). Unlike \nother governments, it cannot effectively pay for services \nthrough tax receipts. Even if it wanted to, its lands are too \nsparsely populated to provide much income from tourism, \ngaming, or similar activities.\nWhat it does have, by fate or good luck, is substantial \nquantities of superior waxy crude oil. But by fate or bad \nluck, it does not have the same access to markets as other \nRLO\u0003\u00c0HOGV\u0003LQ\u0003WKH\u00038QLWHG\u00036WDWHV\u0011\u0003*DLQLQJ\u0003WKDW\u0003DFFHVV\u0003ZRXOG\u0003\ncreate jobs and improve the income of the Tribe and \nits members. As discussed below, the Tribe would have \ngained that access if the D.C. Circuit had correctly applied \nthe NEPA and this Court\u2019s precedents.\nThe three Bands that make up the Ute Indian Tribe \n(the Uintah, White River, and Uncompahgre Bands) \noriginally occupied the land between present day Denver \nand Salt Lake City. The Uintah Band occupied land in \npresent day Utah, including land in the Uintah Basin in \nnortheastern Utah. The White River and Uncompahgre \nBands occupied northwestern and central western \nColorado (including all the land now in Eagle County, \nColorado).\n\n5\nFollowing the Meeker Incident in 1879, the non-Indian \nColoradans, led by Colorado Governor Frederick Pitkin \nadopted the rallying cry \u201cThe Utes Must Go!,\u201d2 asserting \nthe United States should forcibly remove the Uncompahgre \nand White River Bands from Colorado. Peter R. Decker, \n\u201cThe Utes Must Go!\u201d: American Expansion and the \nRemoval of a People, ch. 6 (2004).\nOne reason Coloradans wanted the White River and \nUncompahgre Bands removed or exterminated was to \nopen land for the main line east-to-west railroad relevant \nto this case\u2014the railroad through Eagle County Colorado. \nGov. Frederick Pitkin to Jay Gould (23 Oct. 1879) (quoted \nin \u201cThe Utes Must Go!\u201d, 149). Eagle County Colorado and \nthe coalition of environmental groups aligned with them \nnow have the audacity and shamelessness to assert that \npermitting oil, agricultural products, or anything else that \na common carrier railroad might transport from present \nday Ute lands to pass over that very same rail line is a \ngreat ill which must be prevented.\n7KH\u0003([HFXWLYH\u0003%UDQFK\u000f\u0003LQ\u0003GH\u00c0DQFH\u0003RI\u0003WKH\u0003$FW\u0003RI\u0003-XQH\u0003\n15, 1880,3 21 Stat. 199, forcibly marched the White River \n2. Governor Pitkin did not care whether \u201cgo\u201d meant \u201cgo by \nforce from Colorado\u201d or whether it meant extermination. E.g., Gov. \nFrederick Pitkin to Carl Schurtz (Oct 12, 1879) (quoted in \u201cThe \nUtes Must Go!\u201d, 147)\n3. In the Act of June 15, 1880, Congress took the Tribe\u2019s \n\u201cpermanent\u201d reservation, created just more than a decade earlier, \nand directed the Executive Branch to create a replacement \nreservation for the Uncompahgre Band around the present-day \nlocation of Grand Junction, Colorado if land in that area was \ncultivable. There was and is such cultivable lands in that area, \nbut the Executive Branch, at the urging of Colorado, created the \nreplacement reservation on non-cultivable lands in Utah.\n\n6\nBands from Colorado to the Uintah Valley Reservation in \nUtah and forcibly marched the Uncompahgre Band to the \nUncompahgre Band in Utah. Ute Indian Tribe v. Utah, \n790 F.3d 1000 (10th Cir. 2015).\nThe area from which the non-Indians forced the \nUtes now contains common carrier rail lines, interstate \nroadways, commercial airports, cities, oil and hard \nmineral producing lands, fertile agricultural lands, etc. It \nFRQWDLQV\u0003VXEVWDQWLDO\u0003RLO\u0003\u00c0HOGV\u0003DQG\u0003DJULFXOWXUDO\u0003ODQGV\u0003WKDW\u0003\nare connected to the United States rail infrastructure. \nIt is firmly tied to the United States economic and \ntransportation infrastructure.\nAll of Eagle County Colorado was originally Ute \nlands. The unemployment rate in Eagle County is under \n3%.4 Eagle County includes Vail, Colorado, where average \nhome prices are over $2,000,000.5 It also includes Minturn, \nnamed after the vice president of the railroad company \nthat brought a rail line to that town and others in the area.6\nIn contrast, the Uintah Basin has to date proven too \nUHPRWH\u0003DQG\u0003WRR\u0003GLI\u00c0FXOW\u0003WR\u0003DFFHVV\u0011\u0003,W\u0003KDV\u0003RQH\u0003WZR\u0003ODQH\u0003\nroad from east to west, an airport with only two small \nFRPPHUFLDO\u0003\u00c1LJKWV\u0003SHU\u0003GD\\\u000f\u0003QR\u0003UDLO\u0003DFFHVV\u000f\u0003QR\u0003VNL\u0003UHVRUWV\u0003\nor chalets for the rich and famous.

Before the United States permitted a reservation \nto be established in the Uintah Basin,7 the Utah \nTerritorial Indian Superintendent dispatched a survey \nteam to determine whether the proposed reservation \nlands would be suitable for non-Indian settlement. \n7KH\u0003WHDP\u00b7V\u0003\u00b4XQDQLPRXV\u0003DQG\u0003\u00c0UP\u00b5\u0003YHUGLFW\u0003ZDV\u0003WKDW\u0003WKH\u0003\nproposed reservation lands were \u201cone vast \u2018contiguity \nof waste,\u2019 and measurably valueless, except for nomadic \npurposes, hunting grounds for Indians and to hold the \nworld together.\u201d Report of Utah Expedition, printed \nin Deseret News, Sept. 25, 1961, quoted in Charles \nWilkinson, Fire on the Plateau, 150 (Island Press 2004). \nSee also U.S. Department of the Interior, Annual Report \nof the Commissioner of Indian Affairs to the Secretary of \nthe Interior for the Year 1886, 225. (\u201cThe Uncompahgre \nReserve is a desert. Of the 1,933,440 acres embraced \ntherein not one can be relied on to produce a crop without \nirrigation, and not more than 3 per cent of the whole \nis susceptible of being made productive by process of \nirrigation.\u201d).\nThe Tribe\u2019s Uncompahgre Reservation remains one \nof the least populated areas in the United States. The \nUncompahgre Reservation is substantially larger than \nthe State of Delaware. There is only one census area on \n7. The Uintah and Ouray Reservation started as two \nseparate reservations: the Uintah Valley Reservation (for \nthe Uintah and later also the White River Bands) and the \nUncompahgre Reservation (for the Uncompahgre Bands). Because \nthe Uncompahgre Reservation is virtually uninhabitable, the \nReservations were eventually combined and a single government \nfor the three Bands was created. \n\n8\nthe Uncompahgre Reservation, and in the most recent \ndecennial census that census area, Bonanza, dropped from \na population of one in the 2010 census to a population of \nzero. Emily Harris, First Insights\u20142020 Census Utah \nCounties and Communities (Univ. Utah 2021).\nRespondents Eagle County Colorado and its aligned \nNGOs want to keep it that way.\nUnbeknownst to Coloradans or the United States \nwhen the White River and Uncompahgre Bands were \nforcibly removed from their Reservations in Colorado \nto land in Utah, the Uintah Valley Reservation and the \nUncompahgre Reservation in Utah contained valuable \nmineral resources. First the United States found that the \nlands contained Gilsonite. Congress took that land from \nthe Tribe. Act of May 24, 1888, ch. 310, 25 Stat. 157. Later, \nthe United States discovered the Reservation contained \nRQH\u0003RI\u0003WKH\u0003ODUJHVW\u0003DQG\u0003EHVW\u0003RLO\u0003\u00c0HOGV\u0003LQ\u0003WKH\u00038QLWHG\u00036WDWHV\u0011\u0003\nBy the time the United States realized the land contained \noil, Congress did not have the audacity to take that land.8\nThe United States owns most of the land on the Tribe\u2019s \nReservation. Similarly, the United States owns much of \nthe land on all Indian Reservations and the United States \nowns about half of the land west of the Rocky Mountains. \nNearly anything occurring on that federally owned land \ninvolves federal permitting, leasing, or other federal \nactions, and therefore requires NEPA review. 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 4332(C).\n8. The Executive Branch did, and currently still does, have \nthat audacity, but that is a case for a later date. \n\n9\nThe Tribe is not complaining about NEPA review. \nBut as will be discussed below, Respondents\u2019 perpetual \nlitigation to keep the Ute Indian Tribe from making a \nliving from the Tribe\u2019s otherwise barren Uncompahgre \nlands is particularly egregious. Respondents went to \nan agency which is expressly barred from considering \nwho is seeking to ship, or the products that are to be \nshipped, on a common carrier rail line. When that agency \ncorrectly denied Respondents\u2019 goal, Respondents chose to \ngo to the D.C. Circuit, which had previously adopted an \noutlier position among the circuits, in which it requires \nagencies to consider effects outside of the agency\u2019s mission \nor jurisdiction. The D.C. Circuit also holds that it can \nvacate an agency decision if the three judges drawn for \na particular appeal decide that they want the agency to \nconsider additional \u201cbut for\u201d effects of the agency decision.\nBecause so much of what occurs on the Tribe\u2019s \nReservation and more generally on land in the West \ninvolves federal action by multiple federal agencies, \nthe D.C. Circuit\u2019s decision would have an inordinate \ndetrimental impact for the Tribe and others living in the \nWest.\nSince the early 1900s, there have been efforts to \nbuild a railroad that would connect the Uintah Valley to \nAmerican\u2019s railway infrastructure. E.g., Robert Athearn, \nRebel of the Rockies: The Denver and Rio Grande \nWestern Railroad (1962) (discussing plans for a railroad \nfrom Denver to Salt Lake via the Uintah Basin); Utah \nDep\u2019t Transp., Uintah Basin Railroad Feasibility Study \nSummary Report (Jan 9, 2015) (hereinafter 2015 Report)\n(discussing a prior feasibility study for the \u201cIsolated \nEmpire rail line\u201d in 2001). None of those efforts succeeded.\n\n10\nThe most recent effort to connect the \u201cIsolated \nEmpire\u201d to the United States rail infrastructure began \nin 2013. 2015 Report \u00a71.0.\nB.  The Interstate Commerce Act and the duty of \ncommon carriers and the limited jurisdiction \nand role of the Surface Transportation Board\nIn 1887, Congress passed the Interstate Commerce \nAct (the ICA). A core purpose of the ICA was to prohibit \ninterstate railroads from discriminating in the products \nthey hauled. This was a hard-fought policy issue for \ndecades before the passage of the ICA. In the years \nleading up to passage of the ICA, much of the concern \nabout harmful discrimination in pricing and access by \nrailroads came from agricultural interests, and many \nstates passed \u201cGranger laws,\u201d which included the same \nanti-discrimination policy later adopted into the ICA. \nSee Wabash, St. L. & P.

In contrast to the lengthy process for the 88-mile spur line, \nthe 1900-mile transcontinental railroad from Council Bluffs Iowa \nto the West Coast was approved by Congress in 1862, 12 Stat. 489, \n\n13\nThe STB provided a substantial discussion of potential \nenvironmental effects from the proposed rail line. But, \nconsistent with its limited role\u2014freight rail and related \nsurface transportation\u2014it properly rejected Respondents\u2019 \nassertions that the Board should enforce Respondent \nNGOs\u2019 desired energy policy under the guise of NEPA \nreview or Respondent Eagle County\u2019s attempt to prevent \nthe common carrier railroad passing through Eagle \nCounty from carrying more crude oil.\nQuoting and correctly applying this Court\u2019s holding \nfrom Public Citizen, 541 U.S. at 767-68, the STB \nconcluded that because the STB does not regulate, and \nin fact does not even have \u201cauthority or jurisdiction over \ndevelopment of oil and gas in the Basin,\u201d any conjectured \nfuture changes to that development of oil and gas were \nnot under its environmental review authority.

The D.C. Circuit erred\nIn their opening merits brief, Petitioners show that the \nD.C. Circuit plainly erred. Although the Respondents will \nattempt to argue otherwise in their upcoming response, \nconstruction began in 1863, and the line was completed and the \ngolden spike driven on May 10, 1869. \n\n14\namicus believe the debate about whether the D.C. Circuit \nerred is over. The D.C. Circuit erred.\nAs Petitioners show, the issue presented is how far \ndown the line (non-literally10) an agency must look. Amicus \nemphasis the word must, because that is at the core of the \nD.C. Court\u2019s error.\nPublic Citizen provided a clear and easily applied \nstandard. An agency meets the procedural requirements \nfor NEPA analysis, and a Court therefore cannot vacate \nand remand to the agency, if the agency has adequately \nconsidered the environmental consequences which are \nwithin that particular agency\u2019s regulatory authority.11\nUnder Public Citizen, the agency was permitted \nto limit its NEPA analysis to the effects proximately \ncaused by the actions over which they have regulatory \nresponsibility, 541 U.S. at 767, and its decision to so limit \nits analysis cannot be vacated by a court.\n10. The D.C. Circuit held that the agency had to consider \nalleged possible effects long after products that could be hauled on \nthe spur line left that spur line, and even long after they left other \nrail lines 1500 or more miles away, Pet.

Jay \nGOODWIN PROCTER LLP \n1900 N Street, NW \nWashington, DC 20036 \nwjay@goodwinlaw.com  \n(202) 346-4000 \n \n \nCounsel of Record for  \nRespondent Eagle County, \nColorado \n \n \nDated: October 25, 2024 \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n2 \n \nPursuant to Rules 21 and 28.4 of the Rules of this Court, respondent Eagle \nCounty, Colorado (\u201cEagle County\u201d), and respondents Center for Biological Diversity, \nLiving Rivers, Sierra Club, Utah Physicians for a Healthy Environment, and \nWildEarth Guardians (\u201cEnvironmental Respondents\u201d) respectfully move for divided \nargument.  This case is scheduled for oral argument on December 10, 2024.  Eagle \nCounty and the Environmental Respondents propose to divide respondents\u2019 time \nequally, with fifteen minutes for Eagle County and fifteen minutes for \nEnvironmental Respondents.1  Granting this motion therefore would not require the \nCourt to enlarge the scheduled time for argument, and the Court has not scheduled \nanother case for argument on the same day.  The division of argument time will \nensure that both sets of respondents\u2014one a local government in an area where \nparticular environmental effects of the proposed railway will be felt; the other, a \ngroup of environmental organizations with deep expertise in and commitment to the \nlegal issues at stake in this case, representing people who will also feel the \nenvironmental effects\u2014can adequately present their own distinct perspectives and \nrepresent their own interests.   \n1. \nThis case involves a challenge under the National Environmental \nPolicy Act (\u201cNEPA\u201d) to an order of the Surface Transportation Board (\u201cBoard\u201d) \nauthorizing the construction and operation of a new rail line in the Uinta Basin in \n \n1  \nThe United States and other federal entities are also respondents, but have filed \na brief supporting petitioners as to the disposition of this case (though \ndisagreeing with aspects of petitioners\u2019 reasoning).  We understand that the \nSolicitor General intends to file a motion to share time with petitioners and does \nnot seek any portion of respondents\u2019 time. \n\n \n3 \nUtah that will primarily be used to take new crude oil produced in the Basin to \nmarket. \n2. \nBelow, Eagle County and Environmental Respondents filed separate \npetitions for review of the Board\u2019s order in the United States Court of Appeals for \nthe District of Columbia Circuit.  The court of appeals consolidated the two petitions \nand heard the cases together.  Pet. App. 13a.  Before the court of appeals, although \nEagle County and the Environmental Respondents both argued that the Board had \nviolated NEPA, they raised related but distinct points in support of their \narguments.  \n3. \nAs relevant here, the court of appeals ultimately agreed with a subset \nof the arguments raised by Eagle County and, separately, a subset of the arguments \nraised by Environmental Respondents.  It therefore granted the petitions in part, \nvacated the Board\u2019s order as arbitrary and capricious, and remanded the matter to \nthe Board for further proceedings.   \n4. \nThis Court granted certiorari to address the question whether NEPA \n\u201crequires an agency to study environmental impacts beyond the proximate effects of \nthe action over which the agency has regulatory authority.\u201d  Pet. i. \n5. \nDivided argument is appropriate here because respondents have \ndistinct perspectives on the question presented, which they have articulated in two \nseparate briefs.  This Court often grants divided argument when two sets of parties \nwith their own counsel each file separate briefs emphasizing different arguments in \nsupport of the same overarching disposition.  See, e.g., Fulton v. City of \n\n \n4 \nPhiladelphia, No. 19-123, 141 S. Ct. 230 (Oct. 5, 2020); Kelly v. United States, No. \n18-1059, 140 S. Ct. 661 (Dec. 16, 2019); Rucho v. Common Cause, No. 18-422, 139 S. \nCt. 1316 (Mar. 15, 2019); McDonald v. City of Chicago, No. 08-1521, 130 S. Ct. 1317  \n(Jan. 25, 2010).     \n6. \nEagle County\u2019s brief emphasizes the aspect of this case in which Eagle \nCounty has a strong and local interest:  the Board\u2019s arbitrary discussion of \n\u201cdownline\u201d environmental effects stemming from the substantial increase in train \ntraffic on an existing rail line in Colorado, which passes through Eagle County.  The \nEnvironmental Respondents emphasize the Board\u2019s failure to consider \nenvironmental effects stemming from increased production of crude oil in the Basin \nand from refining that crude.  The distinction between these different sets of \nenvironmental effects is important because the Board and the court of appeals took \ndifferent approaches to these issues below.  The Board did not consider certain \nenvironmental effects of the increased production of Basin crude and refining of \nBasin crude, and the court of appeals held that its explanation for not doing so was \ninsufficient.  The Board did evaluate downline effects in Colorado, though its \nanalysis failed to comply with NEPA.  Eagle County\u2019s brief also explains why the \ndownline effects are not properly part of the case before this Court given the way \npetitioners chose to present the case at the certiorari stage. \n7. \nThis Court has also routinely allowed divided argument when, as here, \na government entity and a private party are on the same side of a dispute.  That \npractice recognizes that governmental parties have distinct interests that would be \n\n \n5 \nmore difficult for a private organization to represent.  See, e.g., Am. Legion v. Am. \nHumanist Ass\u2019n, No. 17-1717, 139 S. Ct. 951 (U.S. Jan. 22, 2019) (dividing \nargument between the Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission \nand private petitioners); see also Dep\u2019t of Commerce v. New York, No. 18-966, 139 S. \nCt. 1543 (Apr. 12, 2019) (state and private petitioners); Tennessee Wine & Spirits \nAss\u2019n v. Blair, No. 18-96, 139 S. Ct. 783 (Jan. 4, 2019) (state and private petitioner); \nMasterpiece Cakeshop, Ltd. v. Colo. Civil Rights Comm\u2019n, No. 16-111, 138 S. Ct. 466 \n(Nov. 21, 2017) (state agency and private respondents).  As a local government, \nEagle County has a unique perspective on the importance of NEPA for states and \nlocalities.     \n* * * \nFor the foregoing reasons, Eagle County and the Environmental Respondents \nrespectfully request that the Court permit divided argument. \nRespectfully submitted. \n \nKirti Datla \n     Counsel of Record \nBenjamin Chagnon \nEARTHJUSTICE \n1001 G Street, NW, Suite 1000 \nWashington, DC 20001 \nkdatla@earthjustice.org  \n(202) 797-5241 \n \nCounsel for Environmental  \nRespondents \n \nWilliam M.

Eagle County,  \nColorado, et al., No. 23-975 \n \nDear Mr. Harris: \n \n \nOn December 10, 2024, this Court held oral argument on the above-captioned case, which \nconcerns the proper application of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA), Pub. \nL. No. 91-190, 83 Stat. 852 (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.).  NEPA requires federal agencies to prepare \nan environmental impact statement in connection with a proposal for \u201cmajor Federal actions \nsignificantly affecting the quality of the human environment.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C).  In this case, \npetitioners challenge the court of appeals\u2019 determination that the Surface Transportation Board \n(Board) failed to satisfy NEPA\u2019s requirements in preparing the environmental impact statement \nsupporting the Board\u2019s decision to authorize the construction of a railway line connecting the Uinta \nBasin with the national rail network in Utah.  The federal respondents filed briefs on the merits \nsupporting petitioners.  Although those briefs focused on the proper interpretation of the statutory \ntext and this Court\u2019s precedents, they also cited and discussed NEPA regulations promulgated by \nthe Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) to \u201creinforce\u201d the federal respondents\u2019 position.  \nFed. Resp. Opening Br. 29.  CEQ began promulgating its NEPA regulations at the direction of \nExecutive Order 11,991, issued by President Carter on May 24, 1977. \n \n \nBecause of federal respondent\u2019s invocation of the CEQ regulations, we wish to inform the \nCourt that, on January 20, 2025, President Trump issued an Executive Order rescinding Executive \nOrder 11,991.  See White House, Presidential Actions, Unleashing American Energy, Executive \nOrder, \u00a7 5, available at https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/unleashing-\namerican-energy/.  The new Executive Order also provides that \u201cwithin 30 days of the date of this \norder, the Chairman of [CEQ] shall provide guidance on implementing [NEPA] and propose \nrescinding CEQ\u2019s NEPA regulations found at 40 CFR 1500 et seq.\u201d  Ibid.   \n \nI would appreciate it if you would circulate this letter to Members of the Court.   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSincerely, \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSarah Harris \n \n \n \n \n \n \nActing Solicitor General \ncc: \nSee Attached Service List \n\n23-0975\nSEVEN COUNTY INFRASTRUCTURE COALITION,\nET AL.\nEAGLE COUNTY, COLORADO, ET AL.\nJ.

Eagle County, No. 23-975 \nDear Mr. Harris: \nRespondents Eagle County, Colorado and the Center for Biological Diversity, et \nal. seek to extend by 30 days their time for responding to the petition in this case. \nThis Court has already granted one 30-day extension, so that responses are \ncurrently due May 6, 2024. Petitioners would consent to an extension of 14 days, \nuntil May 20, 2024. Beyond that, Petitioners oppose an extension. \nPetitioner Seven County Infrastructure Coalition is a public interlocal entity \ncomprising seven counties in eastern Utah. Its board meets publicly once-a-month \nto plan its programs and expenditures. Because the rail line at issue here is a key \npart of Seven County\u2019s work, its planning will become substantially more difficult if \nthe Court cannot consider this petition before recessing for the summer, as would \nhappen if the full extension were granted. If instead responses are due by May 20, \nPetitioners could waive the usual 14-day waiting period under Rule 15.5, allowing \nthe petition to be distributed on May 28 for consideration at the June 13 conference. \nThe petition in this case was filed March 4, 2024. Having already received one \n30-day extension, Respondents\u2019 current total response time is 63 days. An \nadditional 14-day extension would give them 77 days to respond. Petitioners respect \nRespondents\u2019 need to coordinate and that Respondents\u2019 counsel have competing \nobligations.

Ute Indian Tribe v. State of Utah, \n521 F. Supp. 1072, 1093 (D. Utah 1981). \n \nThe Uintah and Ouray Reservation is in the Uin-\ntah Basin, the area which would be serviced by the \ncommon carrier rail line that is at issue in this case. \nThe Uintah and Ouray Reservation includes lands \nin Uintah, Duchesne, Carbon, Wasatch, and Summit \nCounties in Utah. \u201cCattle raising and mining of oil and \nnatural gas is big business on the reservation.\u201d About \nthe Utes, available at utetribe.com. \n \nWestern States and Tribal Nations Natural Gas \nInitiative is a state, county and tribal government-\nled 501(c)(4) initiative working to facilitate economic \ndevelopment and tribal sovereignty through the  \n \n \n \n \n1 Pursuant to this Court\u2019s Rule 37.6, counsel for amici curiae \ncertify that no person or entity other than amici curiae and their \ncounsel authored this brief in whole or in part.

Unlike most of the petitions for writ \nof certiorari this Court receives, the Court need not \nrely upon arguments of counsel to determine that this \nconflict exists: the circuits themselves acknowledge \nthat they are in conflict. E.g., Ctr. for Biol. Diversity v. \nU.S. Army Corps of Eng\u2019rs, 941 F.3d 1288, 1299-1300 \n(11th Cir. 2019) (discussing the conflict). \n \nThe United States Court of Appeals for the Dis-\ntrict of Columbia Circuit has adopted the minority po-\nsition on this conflict. Id. (noting that the D.C. Circuit \nis an \u201coutlier\u201d). The Eleventh Circuit further noted \nthat the \u201clegal analysis [of the two-judge majority in \nthe D.C. Circuit decision in Sierra Club v. FERC, 867 \nF.3d 1357 (D.C. Cir. 2017)] is questionable at best. It \nfails to take seriously the rule of reason announced in \nPublic Citizen or to account for the untenable conse-\nquences of its decision.\u201d Id. at 1300. The Eleventh Cir-\ncuit agreed with the strong dissent in Sierra Club. Id. \nat 1300. \n \nHere, Petitioners applied for authorization of a \nspur railroad line into the Uintah Basin in Utah. That \nrailroad would dramatically improve the economy and \n\n3 \nthe lives of the Ute Indian Tribe and others who live in \nthe Uintah Basis. The application was submitted to the \nSurface Transportation Board (STB), and the STB did \n\u201ctake seriously\u201d this Court\u2019s holding in Public Citizen. \nThe STB properly limited its NEPA analysis to its im-\nportant but narrow role within the federal govern-\nment. Its decision was proper under Public Citizen and \nwould be proper in the majority of the circuits which \nhave reached the issue. But the D.C. Circuit held the \nSTB should have gone much further, far afield from the \nSTB\u2019s limited role in the federal government, invading \nthe province of other federal and state agencies and in-\nvading the province of the legislative branch regarding \nnational energy policy. \n \nBecause a large percentage of NEPA cases can be \nfiled in the District of Columbia, the D.C. Circuit\u2019s er-\nroneous decision is the de facto rule that agencies now \nmust follow throughout the United States. \n \nThis Court should grant the petition and deter-\nmine whether the D.C. Circuit\u2019s minority position is \ncorrect. \n--------------------------------- \u2666 --------------------------------- \n \nARGUMENT \nI. \nLegal and factual background \n \nThe Ute Indian Tribe seeks to provide govern-\nmental services for its members and for its large but \nsparsely populated reservation. It seeks to provide \nhealth care, education, housing, and other services. See \n\n4 \ngenerally Utetribe.com (listing and describing tribal \nprograms and services). Unlike other governments, it \ncannot effectively pay for services through tax receipts. \nEven if it wanted to, its lands are too sparsely popu-\nlated to provide much income from tourism, gaming, or \nsimilar activities. \n \nWhat it does have, by fate or good luck, is substan-\ntial quantities of superior waxy crude oil. But by fate \nor bad luck, it does not have the same access to mar-\nkets as other oil fields in the United States. Gaining \nthat access would improve the income of the Tribe and \nits members. As discussed below, the Tribe would have \ngained that access under the court decisions in the ma-\njority of the circuits which have reached the issues. \n \nThe three Bands that make up the Ute Indian \nTribe of the Uintah and Ouray Reservation (the Uin-\ntah, White River, and Uncompahgre Bands) originally \noccupied the land between present day Denver and \nSalt Lake. The Uintah Band occupied land in present \nday Utah, including land in the Uintah Basin in north-\neastern Utah. The White River and Uncompahgre \nBands occupied northwestern and central western \nColorado (including all the land now in Eagle County, \nColorado). \n \nFollowing the Meeker Incident in 1879, the non-\nIndian Coloradans, led by Colorado Governor Fred-\nerick Pitkin adopted the rallying cry \u201cThe Utes Must \nGo!,\u201d2 asserting the United States should forcibly \n \n \n2 Governor Pitkin did not care whether \u201cgo\u201d meant \u201cgo by \nforce from Colorado\u201d or whether it meant extermination. E.g., \n \n\n5 \nremove the Uncompahgre and White River Bands from \nColorado. Peter R. Decker, \u201cThe Utes Must Go!\u201d: Amer-\nican Expansion and the Removal of a People, ch. 6 \n(2004). \n \nOne reason Coloradans wanted the White River \nand Uncompahgre Bands removed or exterminated \nwas to open land for the main line east-to-west railroad \nrelevant to this case\u2014the railroad through Eagle \nCounty Colorado. Pitkin to Jay Gould (Oct. 23, 1879) \n(quoted in \u201cThe Utes Must Go!\u201d, 149). Eagle County \nColorado and the coalition of environmental groups \naligned with them now have the audacity and shame-\nlessness to assert that permitting oil, agricultural \nproducts, or anything else that a common carrier rail-\nroad might transport from present-day Ute lands to \npass over that very same rail line is a great ill which \nmust be prevented. \n \nThe Executive Branch, in defiance of the Act of \nJune 15, 1880,3 21 Stat. 199, forcibly marched the \nBands from Colorado to the Uintah Valley Reservation \nin Utah and an adjoining replacement Reservation for \n \nPitkin to Carl Schurtz (Oct. 12, 1879) (quoted in \u201cThe Utes Must \nGo!\u201d, 147). \n \n3 In the Act of June 15, 1880, Congress took the Tribe\u2019s \u201cper-\nmanent\u201d reservation, created just more than a decade earlier, and \ndirected the Executive Branch to create a replacement reserva-\ntion for the Uncompahgre Band around the present-day location \nof Grand Junction, Colorado if land in that area was cultivable. \nThere was and is such cultivable lands in that area, but the Ex-\necutive Branch, at the urging of Colorado, created the replace-\nment reservation on non-cultivable lands in Utah. \n\n6 \nthe Uncompahgre Band in Utah. Ute Indian Tribe v. \nUtah, 790 F.3d 1000 (10th Cir. 2015). \n \nThe area from which the non-Indians forced the \nUtes now contains common carrier rail lines, interstate \nroadways, commercial airports, cities, oil and hard \nmineral producing lands, fertile agricultural lands, etc. \nIt contains substantial oil fields and agricultural lands \nthat are connected to the United States rail infrastruc-\nture. It is firmly tied to the United States economic and \ntransportation infrastructure. \n \nAll of Eagle County, Colorado was originally Ute \nlands. The unemployment rate in Eagle County is un-\nder 3%.4 Eagle County includes Vail, Colorado, where \naverage home prices are over $2,000,000.5 It also in-\ncludes Minturn, named after the vice president of the \nrailroad company that brought a rail line to that town \nand others in the area.6 \n \nIn contrast, the Uintah Basin has to date proven \ntoo remote and too difficult to access. It has one two \nlane road from east to west, an airport with only two \nsmall commercial flights per day, no rail access, no ski \nresorts or chalets for the rich and famous. From some \nparts of the Uintah Basin, it is a three-hour drive, in \ngood weather, to the nearest four lane road. \n \n \n4 https://vailvalleymeansbusiness.com/data-center/d (last vis-\nited April 2, 2024). \n \n5 https://www.redfin.com/city/20103/CO/Vail/housing-market \n(last visited April 2, 2024). \n \n6 https://www.minturn.org/historic-preservation/pages/timelines \n(last visited April 2, 2024). \n \n\n7 \n \nThe United States and Colorado knew that much \nof the Uintah Basin was and would remain a remote \nhigh desert. Before the United States permitted a res-\nervation to be established in the Uintah Basin,7 the \nUtah Territorial Indian Superintendent dispatched a \nsurvey term to determine whether the proposed reser-\nvation lands would be suitable for non-Indian settle-\nment. The team\u2019s \u201cunanimous and firm\u201d verdict was \nthat the proposed reservation lands were \u201cone vast \n\u2018contiguity of waste,\u2019 and measurably valueless, except \nfor nomadic purposes, hunting grounds for Indians and \nto hold the world together.\u201d Report of Utah Expedi-\ntion, printed in Deseret News, Sept. 25, 1961, quoted \nin Charles Wilkinson, Fire on the Plateau, 150 (Island \nPress 2004). See also U.S. Department of the Interior, \nAnnual Report of the Commissioner of Indian Af-\nfairs to the Secretary of the Interior for the Year 1886, \n225 (\u201cThe Uncompahgre Reserve is a desert. Of the \n1,933,440 acres embraced therein not one can be relied \non to produce a crop without irrigation, and not more \nthan 3 per cent of the whole is susceptible of being \nmade productive by process of irrigation.\u201d). \n \nThe Tribe\u2019s Uncompahgre Reservation remains \none of the least populated areas in the United States. \nThe Uncompahgre Reservation is substantially larger \n \n \n7 The Uintah and Ouray Reservation started as two separate \nreservations: the Uintah Valley Reservation (for the Uintah and \nlater also the White River Bands) and the Uncompahgre Reser-\nvation (for the Uncompahgre Bands). Because the Uncompahgre \nReservation is virtually uninhabitable, the Reservations were \neventually combined and a single government for the three Bands \nwas created. \n\n8 \nthan the State of Delaware. There is only one census \narea on the Uncompahgre Reservation, and in the \nmost recent decennial census that census area, Bo-\nnanza, dropped from a population of one in the 2010 \ncensus to a population of zero. Emily Harris, First In-\nsights\u20142020 Census Utah Counties and Communities \n(Univ. Utah 2021). \n \nRespondents Eagle County, Colorado and its aligned \nNGOs want to keep it that way. \n \nUnbeknownst to Coloradans or the United States \nwhen the White River and Uncompahgre Bands were \nforcible removed from their Reservations in Colorado \nto land in Utah, the Uintah Valley Reservation and the \nUncompahgre Reservation in Utah contained valuable \nmineral resources. First, the United States found that \nthe lands contained Gilsonite, and Congress took that \nland from the Tribe. Act of May 24, 1888, ch. 310, 25 \nStat. 157. Later, the United States discovered the Res-\nervation contained one of the largest and best oil fields \nin the United States. By the time the United States re-\nalized the land contained oil, Congress did not have the \naudacity to take that land.8 \n \nThe United States owns most of the land on the \nTribe\u2019s Reservation. Similarly, the United States owns \nmuch of the land on all Indian Reservations and the \nUnited States owns about half of the land west of \nthe Rocky Mountains. Nearly anything occurring on \nthat federally owned land involves federal permitting, \n \n \n8 The Executive Branch did, and currently still does, have \nthat audacity, but that is a case for a later date. \n\n9 \nleasing, or other federal actions, and therefore requires \nNEPA review. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4332(C). The Tribe is not \ncomplaining about NEPA review. But, as will be dis-\ncussed below, the D.C. Circuit decision would provide \nRespondents with multiple bites at the same apple and \nwould require agencies to conduct the expansive con-\nsideration and issue their own decision, even when \nthey have no authority, jurisdiction, or expertise. \n \nBecause so much of what occurs on the Tribe\u2019s \nReservation and more generally on land west of the \nRocky Mountains involves federal action by multiple \nfederal agencies, the D.C. Circuit\u2019s decision would have \nan inordinate detrimental impact for the Tribe and \nothers living west of the Rocky Mountains. \n \nSince the early 1900s, there have been efforts to \nbuild a railroad that would connect the Uintah Valley \nto American\u2019s railway infrastructure. E.g., Robert \nAthearn, Rebel of the Rockies:  The Denver and Rio \nGrand Western Railroad (1962) (discussing plans for a \nrailroad from Denver to Salt Lake via the Uintah \nBasin); Utah Dep\u2019t Transp., Uintah Basin Railroad \nFeasibility Study Summary Report (Jan. 9, 2015) \n(hereinafter 2015 Report) (discussing a prior feasibil-\nity study for the \u201cIsolated Empire rail line\u201d in 2001). \nNone of those efforts succeeded. \n \nThe most recent effort to connect the \u201cIsolated \nEmpire\u201d to the United States rail infrastructure began \nin 2013. 2015 Report \u00a7 1.0. \n \n\n10 \nII. \nSurface Transportation Board duties and \nproceedings. \n \nThe Surface Transportation Board is an independ-\nent federal agency with a multi-member Board. There \nare approximately eighty independent federal agen-\ncies, and there are approximately seventy federal \nagencies with multi-member boards. Admin. Conf. of \nthe U.S., Sourcebook of United States Executive Agen-\ncies, tables 3, 4 (2d ed. 2018).  \n \nThe STB has a five-member Board. The Board is ap-\npointed by the President with the advice and consent \nof the Senate. 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 1301(a), (b). It is \u201ccharged \nwith the economic regulation of various modes of sur-\nface transportation, primarily freight rail.\u201d stb.gov/about-\nstb/. Because of that limited function, its members \nmust have experience in transportation, economic reg-\nulation, or business. 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 1301(b)(2). \n \nPetitioner submitted a petition for a certificate au-\nthorizing Petitioner to construct a common carrier \nspur rail line from a mainline common carrier railroad \ninto the Uintah Basin. Federal statutes provide that \nupon receipt of a petition to construct a common car-\nrier line, the STB \u201cshall issue a certificate authorizing \n[construction] unless the Board finds that such activi-\nties are inconsistent with the public convenience and \nnecessity.\u201d 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10901(a), (c). \n \nUnder long established federal law and policy, a \ncommon carrier has a statutory duty to carry any prod-\nucts. E.g., 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 11101. The STB therefore does \nnot and cannot determine what products\u2014or whose \n\n11 \nproducts\u2014a common carrier line will carry. The prod-\nucts\u2014on both the proposed spur line and on the main \nline\u2014are determined by the market. Based upon fed-\neral policy codified into statute, any person who is will-\ning to pay to have goods carried is treated on an equal \nbasis by the common carrier. \n \nCongress provided further guidance to the STB in \n49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10101, which defines, through 15 para-\ngraphs, the United States\u2019 \u201crail transportation policy.\u201d \nParagraph 4 states that the United States policy is \u201cto \nensure the development and continuation of a sound \nrail transportation system with effective competition \namong rail carriers and with other modes, to meet the \nneeds of the public and the national defense.\u201d \n \nThe State of Utah completed a preliminary feasi-\nbility study for the current proposal in 2015. 2015 Re-\nport. \n \nThe STB initiated environmental review of the \nUintah Basin Railway proposal in June 2019, and Pe-\ntitioners formally petitioned for a certificate authoriz-\ning construction in May 2020. Eagle Cnty. v. Surface \nTransp. Bd., 82 F.4th 1152, 1165 (D.C. Cir. 2023). The \nSTB issued its final decision in December 2021. Seven \nCnty. Infrastructure Coal.\u2014Rail Constr. & Operation \nExemption\u2014in Utah, Carbon, Duchesne, & Uintah \nCntys., S.T.B. Fin. Dec., Dkt. FD36284, 2021 WL \n5960905 (STB served Dec. 15, 2021). Pet. App. C.9 \n \n \n9 In contrast to the lengthy process for the 88-mile spur line, \nthe 1900-mile transcontinental railroad from Council Bluffs, Iowa \n \n\n12 \n \nThe STB provided a substantial discussion of po-\ntential environmental effects from the proposed rail \nline. But, consistent with its limited role\u2014freight rail \nand related surface transportation\u2014it properly re-\njected Respondents\u2019 assertions that the Board should \nenforce Respondent NGOs\u2019 desired energy policy un-\nder the guise of NEPA review or Respondent Eagle \nCounty\u2019s attempt to prevent the common carrier rail-\nroad passing through Eagle County from carrying \nmore crude oil. \n \nQuoting and correctly applying this Court\u2019s hold-\ning from Public Citizen v. Dept. of Justice, 491 U.S. 440, \n767-68 (1989), the STB concluded that because the \nSTB does not regulate, and in fact does not even have \n\u201cauthority or jurisdiction over development of oil and \ngas in the Basin,\u201d any conjectured future changes to \nthat development of oil and gas were not under its en-\nvironmental review authority. Pet. App. 108a. Instead, \nany such development was for some other agency or \nagencies to consider. \n \nThe STB similarly concluded that because author-\nization of construction of a common carrier railroad in \nUtah does not dictate where crude oil will ultimately \nbe refined, conjectured effect of refinement on commu-\nnities in the Gulf Coast was also not within its author-\nity. \n \n \nto the West Coast was approved by Congress in 1862, 12 Stat. \n489, construction began in 1863, and the line was completed and \nthe golden spike driven on May 10, 1869. \n\n13 \nIII. The Circuit Courts are in conflict. \n \nPetitioner provides a thorough and correct discus-\nsion of the split between the D.C. Circuit and Ninth \nCircuit on one side and the Third, Fourth, Sixth, Sev-\nenth, and Eleventh Circuits on the other side. Pet. 14-\n20. \n \nAs Petitioner shows, the split is over how far down \nthe line (non-literally10) an agency must look. Amicus \ncuriae believe Public Citizen provided a clear and eas-\nily applied answer to that question. The majority of the \ncircuits hold that an agency meets the procedural re-\nquirements for NEPA analysis, and a Court therefore \ncannot vacate and remand to the agency, if the agency \nhas adequately considered the environmental conse-\nquences which are within its regulatory authority. 11 \n \nIf the majority circuit position is correct (and it is, \nunless this Court is going to overrule its prior unani-\nmous decision in Public Citizen), then the agency was \npermitted to limit its NEPA analysis to the \u201ceffects \nproximately caused by the actions over which they \n \n \n10 The D.C. Circuit held that the agency had to consider al-\nleged possible effects long after products that could be hauled on \nthe spur line left that spur line, and even long after they left other \nrail lines 1500 or more miles away, Pet. App. 36a, and yet further \nwhen they were ultimately used by consumers, Pet. App. 35a-36a. \n \n11 The thornier issue which Public Citizen did not answer, \nand which is not presented by the current case, is: can an agency \nconsider effects which are not within its regulatory jurisdiction, \nand if so, when can it do so and when can it not do so. That thorn-\nier question would require the Court to determine when the \ncourts should bar one agency from invading the province of some \nother state, tribal, or federal agency. \n\n14 \nhave regulatory responsibility,\u201d and its decision to so \nlimit its analysis cannot be vacated by a court. \n \nApplying its very different standard, the Court be-\nlow held that the agency was required to engage in a \nwide-ranging analysis of activities that are not within \nthe STB\u2019s regulatory responsibilities, but which are \nwithin the regulatory responsibilities of other agen-\ncies. Moreover, the Court below requires the STB to \nconsider or re-consider possible effects which have been \nor will be reviewed when those other agencies conduct \nNEPA review of proposed federal actions within those \nagencies\u2019 responsibilities. \n \nFor example, the D.C. Circuit chastises the agency \nfor not reviewing how the building of the spur line into \nthe Uintah Valley will impact areas around refineries \non the Gulf Coast. That is not the STB\u2019s realm. Either \nthose existing refineries already have approved capac-\nity to refine that oil, or they would need to obtain that \napproval. In either case, proper NEPA review of the re-\nfineries will be conducted by an agency with direct re-\nsponsibility and familiarity. If the existing refineries \nalready have capacity to refine more crude oil, then the \nenvironmental effects of increasing production up to \nthat already existing capacity has already been ana-\nlyzed and authorized. And if those existing refineries \nwere to need to expand at some point in the future \n(whether because of increased oil from the Uintah Ba-\nsin or from other existing large oil fields in Colorado, \nTexas, Oklahoma, North Dakota, Wyoming, foreign \ncountries, etc.), then the effects would be studied at \nthat time. \n\n15 \n \nSimilarly, if the new rail line were to result in in-\ncreased applications of permits to drill or other oil pro-\nduction-related federal permits, NEPA review of those \nactions would be evaluated at that time. \n \nThe Center for Biological Diversity made the same \nsubstantive argument in the current case as it made \nas Appellants in the Eleventh Circuit. It prevailed in \nthe current case, but it lost in the Eleventh Circuit. As \nthe Eleventh Circuit held in rejecting the Center for \nBiological Diversity\u2019s argument: \nTo take an alternative, unbounded view of the \npublic-interest review would be to appoint the \nCorps de facto environmental-policy czar. Ra-\nther than consider whether the Corps\u2019 own ac-\ntion is in the public interest, that broader \nview would have the Corps consider whether \nfertilizer production and use is really worth \nthe cost. And that could be just the beginning. \nThe next time the Corps is asked to approve a \nsection of a gas pipeline running through a \nwetland, would the Corps be required to con-\nsider whether the country\u2019s reliance on fossil \nfuels is really in the public interest? \nCtr. for Biological Diversity, 941 F.3d at 1299. \n \nThe split between the circuits is directly at issue \nin this case. In the quote above, the Eleventh Circuit \nthought it was asking a softball question or rhetorical \nquestion to show the error of the D.C. Circuit\u2019s prior \ndecisions, but the D.C. Circuit has yet again answered \n\u201cyes\u201d to the question. Under its decision, each of 70 fed-\neral boards not only can, but must, act as if it is the \n\n16 \nczar over federal energy policy, pesticide use, fertilizer \nproduction, etc. \n \nHaving 70 different unelected czars is, of course, \nundemocratic. Setting these policies is for Congress, \nnot for three or four unelected members who constitute \nthe majority on one of the many federal boards. It is \nalso unworkable. For example, as discussed above, if an \nexisting refinery were to seek to expand its refining ca-\npacity, it would have to engage in the lengthy NEPA \nreview for that expansion, and the agency with direct \nauthority over that request could conclude that expan-\nsion is proper under NEPA. Yet, under the duties \nforced upon it by the D.C. Circuit, the STB should deny \na permit if they conclude that the approved refinery is \nharmful. There are about 70 other three or four mem-\nber majorities of boards which will have similar powers \nto set policy. \n \nThe split between the circuits is not going to go \naway until this Court resolves the issue. The D.C. Cir-\ncuit has been on its divergent path since at least 2017, \nwhen it issued its decision in Sierra Club v. FERC, 867 \nF.3d 1357 (D.C. Cir. 2017). The Ninth Circuit adopted \nthe D.C. Circuit\u2019s analysis in Center for Biological Di-\nversity v. Bernhardt, 982 F.3d 723 (9th Cir. 2020). As \nthe current case illustrates, even though it is in the mi-\nnority, the D.C. Circuit is not backing down from its \nminority position. \n \nFor the reasons discussed above, the split needs to \nbe resolved. The STB cited and correctly applied the \nscope of its review under the majority standard, but its \n\n17 \ndecision was then reviewed and vacated under the mi-\nnority standard. For current purposes\u2014a petition for a \nwrit of certiorari\u2014whether the majority or the minor-\nity position is correct is of less importance. The im-\nportant point is that the conflict needs to be resolved. \nThis Court should resolve which standard applies. \n--------------------------------- \u2666 --------------------------------- \n \nCONCLUSION \n \nFor all of the above reasons, the Court should \ngrant the petition for a writ of certiorari. \nRespectfully submitted, \nJEFFREY S.

[to] creat[e] such delay \nas to completely impede the progress of a project.\u201d Pet. \nBr. at 4 (citation omitted).  Petitioners\u2019 amici echo this \nrefrain, with a brief from six Senators claiming that, \nthough Congress enacted NEPA \u201c[a]s a common-sense \nstatute imposing only procedural precautions,\u201d \u201cmany \nlower court decisions\u201d have \u201ctransform[ed]\u201d the law \u201cinto \na roving environmentalist mandate.\u201d Barrasso Br. at 2\u20133.  \nThe solution, for Petitioners and their amici alike, is to \nrelegate NEPA to a \u201cmodest procedural check,\u201d Pet. Br. \nat 4; a \u201cquite modest, even minimalist\u201d Congressional \n\u201cdirective,\u201d CEA Br. at 4; and a \u201cnarrow procedure\u201d that \nagencies undertake as part of the project development \nprocess, Barrasso Br. at 4. \nOur experience as members of the legislative body \nthat has debated, modified, and updated NEPA over \nseveral decades makes clear that such characterizations \nmiss the mark. \nTo start, the path forward is not a return to some \nbygone past, of NEPA as a \u201cminimalist\u201d or \u201cmodest\u201d \nrequirement that agencies must check on their way to \nproject approval.  Those bygone days never happened, for \na simple reason:  Congress never meant for NEPA to be \na \u201cnarrow,\u201d ministerial, box-checking formality.  Barrasso \nBr. at 4.  To the contrary, NEPA became law because, \nbefore its enactment, environmental policy was \u201ctoo \nnarrow, too limited, and too specialized.\u201d National \n\n7 \n \n \nEnvironmental Policy: Hearing Before the Comm. on \nInterior and Insular Affs. on S. 1075, S. 237, and S. 1752, \n91st Cong. 27 (1969) (statement of Sen. Jackson).  There \nwas no mandate calling for interagency coordination or \ncollaboration.  What NEPA did, then, was \u201csupplement \nexisting, but narrow and fractionated, congressional \ndeclarations\u201d by establishing an \u201corderly, rational, and \nconstructive\u201d procedure for considering the environment \nin agency decision-making.  S. REP. NO. 91-296, at 9 \n(1969).  That is exactly the approach the D.C. Circuit took \nbelow, when it understood NEPA to require the Surface \nTransportation Board to assess both the upstream and \ndownstream impacts of the Uinta railway and to consult \nother agencies while doing that assessment. \nNor is this a case, as Petitioners and their amici seem \nto suggest, where Congress passed a law and then fell \nasleep at the wheel while that law metastasized into an \nunmanageable, bureaucratic roadblock.  Instead, as \nrepresentatives who have considered a myriad of NEPA \nreform bills with our colleagues, we say with confidence \nthat Congress has repeatedly enacted changes to NEPA \nand is clearly \u201caware\u201d of how the law has been interpreted \nby agencies and courts.  Cannon v. Univ. of Chicago, 441 \nU.S. 677, 697 (1979).  The many efforts\u2014successful and \nunsuccessful\u2014to legislate with that interpretation firmly \nin \nthe \nbackground \nreflect \nthat \nCongress \nhas \n\u201cacquiesce[d]\u201d \nand \n\u201caffirmed\u201d \nthe \nlong-held \nunderstanding of NEPA as embraced and applied by the \nD.C. Circuit.  Id. at 703.   \nIndeed, a careful review of these legislative efforts \ndemonstrates \nthat \nCongress \nhas \nactively \nand \ncontinuously sought to shape NEPA since its passage, \nwith more than 550 bills put forward.  Several of those \n\n8 \n \n \nbills have become law, including the Energy Policy, \nFAST, and BUILDER Acts.  But none of these laws have \naltered NEPA\u2019s fundamental mission: to require that \u201call \nFederal agencies plan and work toward meeting the \nchallenge of a better environment.\u201d  S. REP. NO. 91-296, \nat 9 (1969).  And even more tellingly, the bills that have \nfailed underscore exactly why Petitioners have come \nknocking on the wrong government door for relief.   \nSenator Mike Lee, for instance, is one of the six \nsignatories to the Petitioners-side Congressional brief.  \nHe was also the lead sponsor of an amendment to the 2024 \nConsolidated Appropriations Act.  Pub. L. 118-42, 138 \nStat. 25.  That amendment, if passed, would have \nexempted from NEPA the railroad project at issue here; \nit would have also ended this specific case and denied \nfurther judicial redress on the NEPA claims.  S. Amend. \n1111, 118th Cong., 169 CONG. REC. S4400 (daily ed. Sept. \n12, 2023).  But that effort failed.  And in the same vein, \nCongress considered various amendments to the \nBUILDER Act that would have also eviscerated NEPA \nalong the lines that Petitioners pursue here.  That effort \nwas likewise unavailing.   \nThis Court has emphasized time and again that it does \nnot \u201csit as a super-legislature and create statutory \ndistinctions where none were intended.\u201d  Sec. Indus. \nAss\u2019n v. Bd. of Gov. of Fed. Res. Sys., 468 U.S. 137, 153 \n(1984) (cleaned up); accord City of New Orleans v. Dukes, \n427 U.S. 297, 303 (1976); Day-Brite Lighting, Inc. v. \nMissouri, 342 U.S. 421, 423 (1952).  Yet that is just what \nPetitioners and their amici seek.  Congress considered, \nbut declined, to give a hall pass to the Uinta project.  It \nhas likewise considered, but declined, to restrict the scope \nof judicial review.  And even as it has adopted other \nchanges to NEPA, it has consistently rejected efforts to \n\n9 \n \n \nstrip the law of its emphasis on interagency processes and \ncoordination.  There is no reason, when Petitioners and \ntheir amici have failed at each turn to obtain their desired \nlegislative solution in a legislative forum, that they should \nnow obtain this same solution in a judicial forum.    \n \nARGUMENT \nI. CONGRESS ENACTED NEPA TO PROVIDE \nFOR \nPROACTIVE \nAND \nCOORDINATED \nENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW.   \nTo understand why Congress needed a statute like \nNEPA to require large-scale, cross-agency action, one \nneed first consider the state of environmental law pre-\nNEPA.    \nAt the time, the Clean Air Act, Water Pollution \nControl Act, and other laws offered a patchwork of \nsubstantive environmental protections.  No statute, \nthough, \u201cprovide[d] an effective or orderly manner to \nconsider all forms of environmental degradation,\u201d \nparticularly those which might cut across geography and \njurisdiction.  115 CONG. REC. 29053 (1969).  Many agencies \ndid not \u201chave a mandate within the body of their enabling \nlaws to allow them to give adequate attention to \nenvironmental values,\u201d S. REP. NO. 91-296, at 14 (1969), \nmuch less the \u201cclear authority to assure consideration of \nenvironmental factors which conflict with other Federal \nobjectives,\u201d 115 CONG. REC. 40419 (1969).    \nThe results of this blinkered approach were \npredictable.  In describing the Tennessee Valley \nAuthority (\u201cTVA\u201d), for instance, then-Interior Secretary \nStewart Udall observed that \u201ctheir mission was to \n\n10 \n \n \nproduce electric power as cheaply as possible.\u201d But he \nbemoaned where this narrow focus led the Authority; if \nsticking to this mission \u201cdestroyed resources, rivers and \nhillsides, and ruined parts of the country outside the TVA \narea for all time, this was none of their business.\u201d  Joint \nHouse-Senate Colloquium to Discuss a National Policy \nfor the Environment: Hearing Before the Comm. on \nInterior and Insular Affs. U.S. S. and the Comm. on \nScience and Astronautics U.S. H.R., 90th Cong. 15 (1968).   \nNor was the TVA some unique creature of federal law.  \n\u201cMany of the environmental controversies\u201d of the day \nwere \u201ccaused by the failure to consider all relevant points \nof view in the planning and conduct of Federal activities,\u201d \nS. REP. NO. 91-296, at 20 (1969), with the unintended, \nenvironmental impacts following a major California oil \nspill serving as the lynchpin behind NEPA\u2019s drafting and \nultimate passage, Teresa Sabol Spezio, The Santa \nBarbara Oil Spill and Its Effect on United States \nEnvironmental Policy, 10 Sustainability 2750 (2018).    \nThus, when introducing the Act, lead sponsor Henry \nJackson chided lawmakers for constantly \u201creacting to \ncrisis situations in the environmental field.\u201d Richard F. \nWeingroff, Addressing the Quiet Crisis: Origins of the \nNational Environmental Policy Act of 1969, U.S. Dep\u2019t \nof Transp., Fed. Highway Admin. (Jan. 15, 2009), \nhttps://perma.cc/P2XC-EADF.  \u201cWhat we should be \ndoing,\u201d Jackson underscored, \u201cis setting up institutions \nand procedures designed to anticipate environmental \nproblems before they reach the crisis stage.\u201d Id. \nOther members of Congress shared that view:    \nenvironmental disasters should no longer be \u201cthe spinoff, \nthe fallout, and the unanticipated consequence[]\u201d of \u201cthe \npursuit of narrower, more immediate goals.\u201d S. REP. NO. \n\n11 \n \n \n91-296, at 9 (1969).   Instead, because \u201c[e]nvironmental \nproblems \ncut \nacross \nmany \nexisting \noperational \norganizations\u201d and thus cannot be in \u201cthe exclusive \nbailiwick of any committee of Congress nor department of \nGovernment,\u201d NEPA would provide \u201call agencies and all \nFederal officials with a legislative mandate and a \nresponsibility to consider the consequences of their \nactions on the environment.\u201d  CONGRESSIONAL WHITE \nPAPER ON A NATIONAL POLICY FOR THE ENVIRONMENT \n12 (Comm. Print. 1968); 115 CONG. REC. 40423 (1969); S. \nREP. NO 91-296, at 14 (1969).  Rather than operating in \nnarrowly \ndrawn \nsilos, \nagencies \nwould \ntake \nan \n\u201cinterdisciplinary, \nteam \napproach\u201d \nto \nassess \nthe \nconsequences of federal development projects.  115 CONG. \nREC. 29085 (1969). \nThe contemporaneous legislative record affirms the \nimportance of and need for interagency coordination, both \nfor NEPA generally and for the Environmental Impact \nStatement (\u201cEIS\u201d) specifically.  Section 101(a), for \nexample, declares that \u201cthe activities and resources of the \nFederal Government shall be improved and coordinated \nto . . . attain certain broad national goals in the \nmanagement of the environment.\u201d 115 CONG. REC. 29084 \n(1969).  Section 101(b)(4) similarly repudiates the \nunderstanding that \u201cenvironmental evaluation\u201d should be \nrestricted to \u201cthe province of a particular agency.\u201d  115 \nCONG. REC. 29085 (1969). And section 102(2)\u2019s \u201caction-\nforcing\u201d mechanism\u2014the provision at issue here\u2014ties \nthese provisions together, requiring that agencies work \ntogether \u201clest legislation does not matter.\u201d National \nEnvironmental Policy: Hearing Before the Comm. on \nInterior and Insular Affs. on S. 1075, S. 237, and S. 1752, \n91st Cong. 116 (1969) (statement of Sen. Jackson).   \nCongress, in sum, enacted NEPA not as some pro forma \n\n12 \n \n \ncheck, but as a meaningful and responsive mandate for \ninteragency cooperation and coordination.    \n \nII. CONGRESS \nCONTINUES \nTO \nEMBRACE \nNEPA\u2019S HOLISTIC APPROACH.  \nIn addition to glossing over the circumstances \nmotivating NEPA\u2019s passage, Petitioners and their amici \ncommit a second, related misstep.  Several of our Senate \ncounterparts claim that Congress \u201ccould not have \nanticipated\u201d or \u201cpredicted\u201d what NEPA would look like \ntoday: i.e., a coordinated, proactive, and interagency \neffort to assess the environmental impacts of federal \ndevelopment, with the backstop of meaningful judicial \nreview.  Barrasso Br. at 5\u20136.  Petitioners make a \nsubstantially similar claim.   Pet. Br. at 4.  But this \ncharacterization of Congressional intent has little basis in \neither law or fact.  Congress has often amended NEPA\u2014\nbut it has always left Petitioners\u2019 proposed changes on the \ncutting-room floor.   \nA. Congress has actively changed NEPA and \nsought to \nshape \nits \ncontours \nsince \nits \nenactment. \nAs this Court has outlined, \u201cCongress\u2019 acquiescence to \na settled judicial interpretation can suggest adoption of \nthat interpretation.\u201d AMG Cap. Mgmt, LLC v. Fed. Trade \nComm\u2019n, 593 U.S. 67, 81 (2021) (citing Monesson Sw. R. \nCo. v. Morgan, 486 U.S. 330, 338 (1988)).  To be sure, \n\u201cwhen Congress has not comprehensively revised a \nstatutory scheme but has made only isolated amendments \nit is impossible to assert with any degree of assurance that \ncongressional failure to act represents affirmative \n\n13 \n \n \ncongressional \napproval \nof \na \ncourt\u2019s \nstatutory \ninterpretation.\u201d Id. (cleaned up).    \nHere, however, there are far more than the one or two \nexamples of acquiescence which the Court examined and \nsubsequently rejected in AMG Capital, 593 U.S. at 82, \nSolid Waste Agency of Northern Cook County v. U.S. \nArmy Corps of Engineers, 531 U.S. 159, 170 (2001), and \nother cases.    \nThat is because since NEPA\u2019s passage, Congress has \nintroduced at least 550 bills that seek to modify, amend, \nor update the statute in some way.  See Appendix.  In 1970, \nthe first year following NEPA\u2019s passage, Congress \nintroduced ten such bills alone.  In each year since, \nmembers of the House or Senate (and, in many years, \nboth) have proposed legislation touching on NEPA\u2019s \noperation.  That has continued into the instant session, \nwhere Congress introduced, debated, and passed \nlegislation modifying NEPA.  See, e.g., Building Chips in \nAmerica Act of 2023, Pub. L. No. 118-105, 138 Stat. 1587.    \nThe summary chart below captures both the number \nand the continuity of legislative efforts over time.   \n \n\n14 \n \n \n \n \nA closer look into the content of some of these \nlegislative proposals adds further confirmation of the \npoint.   Several bills have sought to expand NEPA\u2019s scope.   \nThese include proposals that seek to provide for private \nstanding, H.R. 15780, 91st Cong. (1970); to establish and \ncoordinate greater data collection, H.R. 4732, 93rd Cong. \n(1973); and to require additional review and comment \nprocedures in the EIS process, S. 1304 & H.R. 3515, 101st \nCong. (1989).  Such efforts to expand and re-affirm \nNEPA\u2019s purview both predate and, more importantly, \npost-date the D.C. Circuit\u2019s decision in Sierra Club v. \nFERC (Sabal Trail), 867 F.3d 1357 (D.C. Cir. 2017).  See \nS. 3754, 118th Cong. (2024).    \nTrue, some of the proposed legislation has tried to \ncurb NEPA\u2019s reach.  See, e.g., S. 1668, 93d Cong. (1973); \n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n120\n140\n2020s\n2010s\n2000s\n1990s\n1980s\n1970s\nProposed Bills Amending, Exempting, \nand/or Incorporating NEPA\n\n15 \n \n \nH.R. 9012, 117th Cong. (2022).  This is not, in other words, \nan instance of one-way traffic.  But that is exactly what \none would expect for an influential, landmark, and heavily \ncontested federal statute: a kaleidoscope of efforts from \ndifferent political factions to change NEPA in different \nways.  As this Court has emphasized, that \u201c[s]incere \nadherents advocating contrary views have ventilated the \nsubject for . . . decades\u201d shows that Congress is \u201cacutely \naware\u201d of a statute\u2019s interpretation and application.  Bob \nJones Univ. v. United States, 461 U.S. 574, 599 (1983).  \nCongressional action vis-\u00e0-vis NEPA, in short, is far \ncloser to the circumstances of Bob Jones University, \nwhen Congress introduced \u201cno fewer than 13 bills\u201d in \ntwelve years, id. at 600, than to AMG Capital or Solid \nWaste Agency. \nB. Congress has adapted NEPA over the years but \nhas left interagency coordination untouched. \nNor has Congress been spinning its wheels with futile \nproposals.  Many bills touching on NEPA\u2019s operation have \nbeen successfully passed across Democratic and \nRepublican administrations.  These laws can be organized \nacross three categories. \nFirst, Congress has established, modified, or \nstreamlined the process for EIS assessments.   Shortly \nafter NEPA\u2019s passage, for instance, Congress clarified \nthe Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s authority to \nreview coordinated agency actions and reports, 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 7609, and asked the agency to ensure that other \n\u201cmission-oriented Federal agencies have access to \nenvironmental expertise to give adequate consideration to \nenvironmental factors,\u201d S. REP. NO. 91-1196, at 43 (1970).     \n\n16 \n \n \nMore recent examples of such action include the \nFixing America\u2019s Surface Transportation (\u201cFAST\u201d) Act, \nwhich streamlined EIS review by allowing states to use \ntheir own environmental laws in limited circumstances, \nPub. L. No. 114-94, \u00a7 330, 129 Stat. 1312, 1392; and the \nBUILDER \nAct \n(passed \nas \npart \nof \nthe \nFiscal \nResponsibility Act of 2023), which imposes thresholds for \nreview, processes for timely review coordination \n(including EIS page limits), and expansion of categorical \nexclusions.  Pub. L. No. 118-5, \u00a7 321, 137 Stat. 10, 38. \nSecond, Congress has recognized special procedures \nfor specific industries.  The Energy Policy Act of 2005, for \nexample, expedited the approval process of \u201cconduct[] \npursuant to the Mineral Leasing Act for the purpose of \nexploration or development of oil or gas.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 \n15942.   National security has similarly been exempted \nfrom general review, through the National Defense \nAuthorization Acts (\u201cNDAA\u201d).  The FY2010 NDAA \nexpedited the process for \u201cthe improvement of port \nfacilities to improve the efficiency of the transportation \nsystem, to increase port security, or to provide greater \naccess to port facilities.\u201d  Pub. L. No. 111-84, \u00a7 3512, 123 \nStat. 2190, 2722 (2009); see also Pub. L. No. 111-383 \n(FY2011 NDAA).2  Most recently, President Biden signed \ninto law a bill that exempts certain semiconductor \nfactories from NEPA.  See Building Chips in America Act \nof 2023, Pub. L. No. 118-105, 138 Stat. 1587. \nThird, Congress has exempted or otherwise singled \nout specific projects.  Shortly after NEPA\u2019s passage, \n \n2 Congress has nevertheless declined to provide blanket \nprotection to defense-related projects, and has at times expanded the \nEIS requirement to cover certain military activities.  H.R. 672, 111th \nCong. (2009). \n\n17 \n \n \nCongress exempted the Trans-Alaska Pipeline from its \nrequirements. 43 U.S.C. \u00a71652.  And the Fiscal \nResponsibility Act of 2023 provided a specific, highly \ncontroversial exception for the Mountain Valley Pipeline \nbased on a Congressional finding that \u201ctimely completion \nof construction and operation\u201d of the Pipeline was \n\u201crequired in the national interest.\u201d Pub. L. No. 118-5, \u00a7 \n324, 137 Stat. 10, 47.    \nTo be clear, many of the undersigned House and \nSenate members here opposed, on substantive grounds, \nlegislation from each of these three categories\u2014from the \nBUILDER Act to the semiconductor exclusion to the \nMountain Valley Pipeline carveout.   Even so, we respect \nthat such choices reflect the active process of \nCongressional policymaking and compromise for NEPA, \njust as it would for any other statute.  These contentious \nquestions of public import are being made precisely where \nthey should be: the U.S. Capitol.    \nC. Petitioners and their amici seek from the Court \nthe same relief they tried and failed to obtain in \nCongress. \nThe same cannot be said for Petitioners and their \namici, who turn to the Court only because they have failed \nto convince Congress to sign onto their cause.  Worse, \nthey have failed in each of the categories outlined above, \nshowing that Petitioners know that \u201cCongress, not this \nCourt, is [the] proper audience\u201d for Petitioners\u2019 \ngrievances.  Kimble v. Marvel Ent., LLC, 576 U.S. 446, \n463 (2015). \n1. Congress has declined to exclude indirect \nand cumulative effects from NEPA review. \n\n18 \n \n \nStart with the first category: laws that have altered or \nstreamlined the EIS.  As outlined above, the FAST and \nBUILDER Acts are the most recent statutes to fall into \nthis bucket.   \nOn the former, the FAST Act unquestionably \npreserves holistic, interagency review.   The Act calls for \ncooperating agencies to produce a single environmental \ndocument \u201cto the maximum extent practicable and \nconsistent with federal law\u201d and implements timelines for \ncross-agency, coordinated reviews.  Pub. L. No. 114-94, \u00a7 \n1304, 129 Stat. 1312, 1380.  But as the Council on \nEnvironmental Quality recognizes, those changes merely \nseek to promote and codify the process \u201cof informed \ndecision-making and environmental review.\u201d Council on \nEnv\u2019t Quality, Introducing Federal Environmental Policy \nAct Practitioners to the Georgia Environmental Policy \nAct \n(2015). \n \nThese \nreforms \ndid \nnot, \nhowever, \nfundamentally alter NEPA\u2019s proactive, interagency \nnature.    \nAs to the BUILDER Act, Petitioners and their amici \nalternatively (1) contend that any Congressional efforts to \nrein in NEPA would be a day late and a dollar short, \nBarrasso Br. at 5\u20136, while (2) nevertheless insisting that \nthe BUILDER Act represents a watershed change to \nNEPA\u2019s trajectory, Pet. Br. at 27.  Neither is true.  The \nBUILDER Act imposes page and time limits and other \nchanges in response to calls from regulated industries for \nNEPA reform.  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4336a.  But the Act continues \nto recognize separate categories of review for \u201ceffects of \nthe proposed agency action\u201d and a broader category of \n\u201ceffects which cannot be avoided should the proposal be \nimplemented.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4332(2)(C)(i), (ii).  In so doing, \nCongress \nacknowledged \nand \nretained \nNEPA\u2019s \n\n19 \n \n \nlongstanding purpose to \u201cpromote efforts which will \nprevent or eliminate damage to the environment and \nbiosphere.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4321. \nWhat is more, before the BUILDER Act\u2019s passage, \nCongress contemplated and debated (but did not pass) \nH.R. 1, the Lower Energy Costs Act. 118th Cong. (2023).  \nThat Act explicitly sought to exclude indirect and \ncumulative effects from EIS consideration and tried to \nseverely constrict judicial review of NEPA decisions.  In \ndebates on the BUILDER Act, Congress likewise \nconsidered but discarded amendments that would have \nrequired consideration only of environmental effects \n\u201cwith a reasonably close relationship\u201d to a proposed \naction, or geographic limits to \u201can area directly affected\u201d \nby a proposed agency action.  H.R. 1577, 118th Cong. \u00a7 \n2(a)(3)(B), 2(b) (2023).  All of these reforms might have \nended this NEPA litigation.  Yet no such reform became \nlaw, separately or as part of the BUILDER Act.3   \n2. Congress has declined to exempt oil and gas \ntransportation from NEPA review. \nThe next category, laws that apply special procedures \nor exemptions to certain industries, tells a similar story.  \n \n3 Several of Petitioners\u2019 amici advance a curious argument:  That \nlaws like the BUILDER Act are not a \u201csilver bullet\u201d because some \njurisdictions appear to treat the Act\u2019s requirements as \u201coptional.\u201d  \nEnergy Transfer Br. at 30 n.6; Anschutz Exploration Br. at 21\u201323.  \nBut the BUILDER Act is barely a year old; it would be premature to \nassess its final impact and deem it insufficient.  That is particularly so \nhere since the STB has not sought to post-hoc the BUILDER Act\u2019s \nlimitations to the project at issue.  In a similar vein, it is unsurprising \nthat courts have continued to apply their longstanding precedent \nfollowing the BUILDER Act\u2019s passage.  After all, unlike H.R. 1, \nnothing about the BUILDER Act constricts the scope or breadth of \njudicial review under NEPA.     \n\n20 \n \n \nAs mentioned, the Energy Policy Act expedited the \nNEPA approval process for certain oil and gas projects.  \nWhat it did not do, though, was change NEPA\u2019s \nrequirement of cross-agency coordination, for the oil and \ngas industry specifically or for any other projects.    \nHere too it is worth examining the relevant \ncounterfactual.  Several of the Senators on the other side \nof this case have sought categorical exclusions or \naccommodations for certain industries.  See Grazing \nImprovement Act, S. 258, 113th Cong. (2013) (Sen. \nBarrasso) (providing categorical exclusions from EIS \nrequirements for certain grazing permits).  That includes \naccommodations for the oil and gas industry.  See \nOffshore Production and Safety Act of 2011, S. 953, 112th \nCong. (Sen. McConnell) (directing that a prior EIS would \nsatisfy NEPA for covered oil and gas leases).  Our \ncolleagues\u2019 efforts confirm that the proper venue for \nPetitioners\u2019 claimed grievance is Congress, not the Court.   \n3. Congress \nconsidered, \nbut \ndeclined, \nto \nexempt the Uinta rail project. \nIf, in other words, Petitioners believe that all fossil-\nfuel infrastructure (or even just this specific project) \ndeserve a special exemption from NEPA, there is a time-\nworn path that they could pursue:  \u201cbicameralism and \npresentment.\u201d  Virginia Uranium, Inc. v. Warren, 587 \nU.S. 761, 778 (2019) (plurality opinion). \nBut there is a reason why Petitioners have not gotten \na legislative exemption for their proposed development.  \nThey tried.  They failed.    \nSenator Lee sought an exemption for this exact \nrailroad project in an amendment to the Consolidated \nAppropriations Act, 2024.  Pub. L. 118-42, 138 Stat. 25.  \nThat amendment sought to \u201cratif[y] and approve[] all . . . \n\n21 \n \n \nstatements[] and any other approvals or orders issued . . . \nfor the Uinta Basin Railway,\u201d as well as to direct the STB \nto \u201cissue all permits or verification necessary\u201d to \n\u201ccomplete the construction\u201d of the rail line.  S. Amend. \n1111, 118th Cong., 169 CONG. REC. S4400 (daily ed. Sept. \n12, 2023).  It would also have terminated the instant \nlitigation and denied further judicial review.  Id.  Senator \nLee\u2019s effort, though, failed to win sufficient Congressional \nsupport.  Months later, Petitioners filed for a writ of \ncertiorari.    \n \n* \n* \n* \n \nAt bottom, this case is about the relationship between \nNEPA past, present, and future.    \nThe record makes plain that, as to NEPA past, federal \ndecision making suffered because agencies too often \ntrampled on public-interest values outside of their \nperceived missions, impaired by proverbial horse \nblinders.   The enacting Congress thus underscored that \nNEPA \u201c[section 101(a) declares that] the activities and \nresources of the Federal Government shall be improved \nand coordinated to . . . attain certain broad national goals \nin the management of the environment.\u201d 115 CONG. REC. \n29084 (1969) (emphasis added).     \nThe record is also clear that NEPA present is a \nproduct of ongoing legislative discussion, debate, and \ncompromise.  In the fifty-five years since NEPA\u2019s \npassage, Congress has expanded, streamlined, tinkered, \nand adapted the statute to fit the policy needs of the day.  \nIt continues to tinker now, knowing full well the scope and \nbreadth of judicial review and knowing that it can alter \nthat scope at any time.    \n\n22 \n \n \nWhat is less clear is who will determine NEPA\u2019s \nfuture.  After their efforts foundered in the halls of \nCongress, Petitioners walked their grievance down the \nstreet, seeking from this Court a judicial solution to their \nlegislative problems.  That path is inappropriate and \nunfounded.  Congress enacted NEPA.  It has changed and \nupdated it.  And it should hold the pen in deciding how the \nstatute applies in the years to come.    \n \nCONCLUSION \nFor these reasons, the judgment of the D.C. Circuit \nshould be affirmed. \n \nRespectfully submitted, \n \n \nCALE JAFFE \nUNIV.

Eagle County, \nColorado, et al., Respondents, No. 23-975 \nDear Mr. Harris: \nRespondent Eagle County, Colorado (Eagle County) and Respondents Center for Biological \nDiversity, et al. (the Center) request an extension of time to file a joint opposition to the Seven \nCounty Infrastructure Coalition, et al.\u2019s (the Coalition) petition for a writ of certiorari in the \nabove-captioned case, which was docketed on March 6, 2024.  The original deadline for \nresponses to the petition was April 5.  On March 26, the Court granted the Solicitor General\u2019s \nrequest to extend that deadline for responses to May 6, which applies to all respondents. \nPursuant to Rule 30.4, Eagle County and the Center respectfully request that the time for filing \nresponses be extended by an additional 30 days, to and including June 5, 2024.  Eagle County \nand the Center require additional time to respond to the petition, and to the seven (7) amicus \nbriefs filed in support of the petition on April 5.  In an effort to preserve judicial resources, Eagle \nCounty and the Center intend to file a single, joint brief in opposition which requires significant \ncoordination and review among the counsel for Eagle County and the Center.   \nAn extension is also necessary because of counsels\u2019 existing schedules.  Counsel of record for \nEagle County Nathaniel Hunt must complete conflicting, existing litigation deadlines.  On \nApril 8 through 12, counsel of record for the Center Wendy Park is scheduled to attend a staff \nretreat and case-related field trip, which were both planned months in advance.  In addition, Ms. \nPark has a motion deadline on April 26 in Coalition for Sonoran Desert Protection v. Federal \nHighway Administration, No. 4:22-cv-00193-JCH (D. Az.), in which the parties are still \nnegotiating issues to avoid a motion; and a May 6 public comment deadline for an agency action \non remand in Center for Biological Diversity v. U.S. Forest Service, No. 2:17-cv-00372-MHW-\nKAJ (S.D. Ohio), which comments are necessary to exhaust administrative remedies.  Ms. Park \nis lead counsel in both of these cases.  During the week of April 15, Ms. Park has been tasked \n\nHonorable Scott S. Harris \nApril 10, 2024 \nPage 2 of 2 \nwith reviewing a draft response (due April 26) to several motions to dismiss totaling over 160 \npages in Utah Physicians for a Healthy Environment v. Utah Department of Natural Resources, \nCase No. 230906637 (3rd Dist., Utah), in which outside counsel represents the Center.  Ms. Park \nis also leading the preparation of public comments on the Proposed North Bullfrog Mine Project \nin Nevada, which are due May 9. \nEagle County and the Center do not anticipate seeking any additional extensions for their \nresponse to the petition. \nRespectfully submitted, \n  /s/ Nathaniel H.

The Court analogized \nthis requirement to the \u201cfamiliar doctrine of \nproximate cause from tort law.\u201d\n . . . \n[W]here an agency has no ability to prevent \na certain effect due to its limited statutory \nauthority over the relevant actions, the agency \ncannot be considered a legally relevant \u201ccause\u201d \nof the effect. Hence, under NEPA and the \nimplementing CEQ regulations, the agency \nneed not consider these effects in its EA[.]\nFor the past 138 years the Surface Transportation \nBoard (STB) and its predecessor have not had statutory \nauthority to determine the shippers who can access a \ncommon carrier rail line or the products that can be \nshipped on a common carrier rail line. Common carriers \nare required to haul all products\u2014whether solar panels \nor oil, products from rural areas or urban, without \ndiscrimination.\n\n3\nBut the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia \nCircuit held that when the STB was deciding whether to \nauthorize an 88-mile common carrier spur line, the STB \nwas required to prognosticate how and where the spur \nOLQH\u0003ZRXOG\u0003LPSDFW\u0003RLO\u0003SURGXFWLRQ\u0003DQG\u0003RLO\u0003UH\u00c0QLQJ\u0011\u00038QGHU\u0003\nthe D.C.

Circuit\u2019s decision was directly and unquestionably \ncontrary to this Court\u2019s prior decisions. Unless this \nCourt is going to overturn its prior unanimous statutory \ninterpretation decision in Public Citizen, this Court must \nvacate the D.C. Court\u2019s decision.\nThis Court should reiterate that when an agency has \n\u201cno ability to prevent a certain effect due to its limited \nstatutory authority,\u201d Public Citizen, 541 U.S. at 770, the \nagency need not consider that effect. Where the agency \nhas considered the effects that are within that agency\u2019s \nstatutory authority, that is the end of the judicial inquiry, \nand the agency\u2019s decision withstands NEPA review.\n\n4\nARGUMENT\nI.  Legal and factual background\nA.  The need for and benefit from a common \ncarrier rail line into the Uintah Basin.\nThe Ute Indian Tribe provides governmental services \nfor its members and for its large but sparsely populated \nreservation. It provides health care, education, housing, \nand other services. See generally utetribe.com (listing \nand describing tribal programs and services). Unlike \nother governments, it cannot effectively pay for services \nthrough tax receipts. Even if it wanted to, its lands are too \nsparsely populated to provide much income from tourism, \ngaming, or similar activities.\nWhat it does have, by fate or good luck, is substantial \nquantities of superior waxy crude oil. But by fate or bad \nluck, it does not have the same access to markets as other \nRLO\u0003\u00c0HOGV\u0003LQ\u0003WKH\u00038QLWHG\u00036WDWHV\u0011\u0003*DLQLQJ\u0003WKDW\u0003DFFHVV\u0003ZRXOG\u0003\ncreate jobs and improve the income of the Tribe and \nits members. As discussed below, the Tribe would have \ngained that access if the D.C. Circuit had correctly applied \nthe NEPA and this Court\u2019s precedents.\nThe three Bands that make up the Ute Indian Tribe \n(the Uintah, White River, and Uncompahgre Bands) \noriginally occupied the land between present day Denver \nand Salt Lake City. The Uintah Band occupied land in \npresent day Utah, including land in the Uintah Basin in \nnortheastern Utah. The White River and Uncompahgre \nBands occupied northwestern and central western \nColorado (including all the land now in Eagle County, \nColorado).\n\n5\nFollowing the Meeker Incident in 1879, the non-Indian \nColoradans, led by Colorado Governor Frederick Pitkin \nadopted the rallying cry \u201cThe Utes Must Go!,\u201d2 asserting \nthe United States should forcibly remove the Uncompahgre \nand White River Bands from Colorado. Peter R. Decker, \n\u201cThe Utes Must Go!\u201d: American Expansion and the \nRemoval of a People, ch. 6 (2004).\nOne reason Coloradans wanted the White River and \nUncompahgre Bands removed or exterminated was to \nopen land for the main line east-to-west railroad relevant \nto this case\u2014the railroad through Eagle County Colorado. \nGov. Frederick Pitkin to Jay Gould (23 Oct. 1879) (quoted \nin \u201cThe Utes Must Go!\u201d, 149). Eagle County Colorado and \nthe coalition of environmental groups aligned with them \nnow have the audacity and shamelessness to assert that \npermitting oil, agricultural products, or anything else that \na common carrier railroad might transport from present \nday Ute lands to pass over that very same rail line is a \ngreat ill which must be prevented.\n7KH\u0003([HFXWLYH\u0003%UDQFK\u000f\u0003LQ\u0003GH\u00c0DQFH\u0003RI\u0003WKH\u0003$FW\u0003RI\u0003-XQH\u0003\n15, 1880,3 21 Stat. 199, forcibly marched the White River \n2. Governor Pitkin did not care whether \u201cgo\u201d meant \u201cgo by \nforce from Colorado\u201d or whether it meant extermination. E.g., Gov. \nFrederick Pitkin to Carl Schurtz (Oct 12, 1879) (quoted in \u201cThe \nUtes Must Go!\u201d, 147)\n3. In the Act of June 15, 1880, Congress took the Tribe\u2019s \n\u201cpermanent\u201d reservation, created just more than a decade earlier, \nand directed the Executive Branch to create a replacement \nreservation for the Uncompahgre Band around the present-day \nlocation of Grand Junction, Colorado if land in that area was \ncultivable. There was and is such cultivable lands in that area, \nbut the Executive Branch, at the urging of Colorado, created the \nreplacement reservation on non-cultivable lands in Utah.\n\n6\nBands from Colorado to the Uintah Valley Reservation in \nUtah and forcibly marched the Uncompahgre Band to the \nUncompahgre Band in Utah. Ute Indian Tribe v. Utah, \n790 F.3d 1000 (10th Cir. 2015).\nThe area from which the non-Indians forced the \nUtes now contains common carrier rail lines, interstate \nroadways, commercial airports, cities, oil and hard \nmineral producing lands, fertile agricultural lands, etc. It \nFRQWDLQV\u0003VXEVWDQWLDO\u0003RLO\u0003\u00c0HOGV\u0003DQG\u0003DJULFXOWXUDO\u0003ODQGV\u0003WKDW\u0003\nare connected to the United States rail infrastructure. \nIt is firmly tied to the United States economic and \ntransportation infrastructure.\nAll of Eagle County Colorado was originally Ute \nlands.

(\u201cThe Uncompahgre \nReserve is a desert. Of the 1,933,440 acres embraced \ntherein not one can be relied on to produce a crop without \nirrigation, and not more than 3 per cent of the whole \nis susceptible of being made productive by process of \nirrigation.\u201d).\nThe Tribe\u2019s Uncompahgre Reservation remains one \nof the least populated areas in the United States. The \nUncompahgre Reservation is substantially larger than \nthe State of Delaware. There is only one census area on \n7. The Uintah and Ouray Reservation started as two \nseparate reservations: the Uintah Valley Reservation (for \nthe Uintah and later also the White River Bands) and the \nUncompahgre Reservation (for the Uncompahgre Bands). Because \nthe Uncompahgre Reservation is virtually uninhabitable, the \nReservations were eventually combined and a single government \nfor the three Bands was created. \n\n8\nthe Uncompahgre Reservation, and in the most recent \ndecennial census that census area, Bonanza, dropped from \na population of one in the 2010 census to a population of \nzero. Emily Harris, First Insights\u20142020 Census Utah \nCounties and Communities (Univ. Utah 2021).\nRespondents Eagle County Colorado and its aligned \nNGOs want to keep it that way.\nUnbeknownst to Coloradans or the United States \nwhen the White River and Uncompahgre Bands were \nforcibly removed from their Reservations in Colorado \nto land in Utah, the Uintah Valley Reservation and the \nUncompahgre Reservation in Utah contained valuable \nmineral resources. First the United States found that the \nlands contained Gilsonite. Congress took that land from \nthe Tribe. Act of May 24, 1888, ch. 310, 25 Stat. 157. Later, \nthe United States discovered the Reservation contained \nRQH\u0003RI\u0003WKH\u0003ODUJHVW\u0003DQG\u0003EHVW\u0003RLO\u0003\u00c0HOGV\u0003LQ\u0003WKH\u00038QLWHG\u00036WDWHV\u0011\u0003\nBy the time the United States realized the land contained \noil, Congress did not have the audacity to take that land.8\nThe United States owns most of the land on the Tribe\u2019s \nReservation. Similarly, the United States owns much of \nthe land on all Indian Reservations and the United States \nowns about half of the land west of the Rocky Mountains. \nNearly anything occurring on that federally owned land \ninvolves federal permitting, leasing, or other federal \nactions, and therefore requires NEPA review. 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 4332(C).\n8. The Executive Branch did, and currently still does, have \nthat audacity, but that is a case for a later date. \n\n9\nThe Tribe is not complaining about NEPA review. \nBut as will be discussed below, Respondents\u2019 perpetual \nlitigation to keep the Ute Indian Tribe from making a \nliving from the Tribe\u2019s otherwise barren Uncompahgre \nlands is particularly egregious. Respondents went to \nan agency which is expressly barred from considering \nwho is seeking to ship, or the products that are to be \nshipped, on a common carrier rail line. When that agency \ncorrectly denied Respondents\u2019 goal, Respondents chose to \ngo to the D.C. Circuit, which had previously adopted an \noutlier position among the circuits, in which it requires \nagencies to consider effects outside of the agency\u2019s mission \nor jurisdiction. The D.C. Circuit also holds that it can \nvacate an agency decision if the three judges drawn for \na particular appeal decide that they want the agency to \nconsider additional \u201cbut for\u201d effects of the agency decision.\nBecause so much of what occurs on the Tribe\u2019s \nReservation and more generally on land in the West \ninvolves federal action by multiple federal agencies, \nthe D.C. Circuit\u2019s decision would have an inordinate \ndetrimental impact for the Tribe and others living in the \nWest.\nSince the early 1900s, there have been efforts to \nbuild a railroad that would connect the Uintah Valley to \nAmerican\u2019s railway infrastructure. E.g., Robert Athearn, \nRebel of the Rockies: The Denver and Rio Grande \nWestern Railroad (1962) (discussing plans for a railroad \nfrom Denver to Salt Lake via the Uintah Basin); Utah \nDep\u2019t Transp., Uintah Basin Railroad Feasibility Study \nSummary Report (Jan 9, 2015) (hereinafter 2015 Report)\n(discussing a prior feasibility study for the \u201cIsolated \nEmpire rail line\u201d in 2001). None of those efforts succeeded.\n\n10\nThe most recent effort to connect the \u201cIsolated \nEmpire\u201d to the United States rail infrastructure began \nin 2013. 2015 Report \u00a71.0.\nB.  The Interstate Commerce Act and the duty of \ncommon carriers and the limited jurisdiction \nand role of the Surface Transportation Board\nIn 1887, Congress passed the Interstate Commerce \nAct (the ICA). A core purpose of the ICA was to prohibit \ninterstate railroads from discriminating in the products \nthey hauled. This was a hard-fought policy issue for \ndecades before the passage of the ICA. In the years \nleading up to passage of the ICA, much of the concern \nabout harmful discrimination in pricing and access by \nrailroads came from agricultural interests, and many \nstates passed \u201cGranger laws,\u201d which included the same \nanti-discrimination policy later adopted into the ICA. \nSee Wabash, St. L. & P. Ry Co. v. Illinois, 118 U.S. 557 \n(1886); Munn v. Illinois, 94 U.S. 113 (1877) (one of the six \n\u201cGranger cases\u201d decided by this Court in 1877).\nIn the Wabash case, this Court substantially \nlimited the effectiveness of state Granger laws, but it \nsimultaneously reiterated that Congress had the power \nto pass similar laws. Congress passed the ICA the next \nyear with broad bipartisan support.\n7KH\u0003,&$\u0003ZDV\u0003D\u0003\u00c0UVW\u0003LQ\u0003PXOWLSOH\u0003ZD\\V\u0011\u0003,W\u0003ZDV\u0003WKH\u0003\u00c0UVW\u0003\nIHGHUDO\u0003VWDWXWH\u0003UHJXODWLQJ\u0003DQ\u0003LQGXVWU\\\u0011\u0003,W\u0003FUHDWHG\u0003WKH\u0003\u00c0UVW\u0003\nof the now numerous federal administrative regulatory \nDJHQFLHV\u0003DQG\u0003ERDUGV\u0011\u0003,W\u0003ZDV\u0003\u00b4>W@KH\u0003\u00c0UVW\u0003IHGHUDO\u0003UHJXODWLRQ\u0003\nto impose duties on common carriers.\u201d F.T.C. v.

The D.C. Circuit erred\nIn their opening merits brief, Petitioners show that the \nD.C. Circuit plainly erred. Although the Respondents will \nattempt to argue otherwise in their upcoming response, \nconstruction began in 1863, and the line was completed and the \ngolden spike driven on May 10, 1869. \n\n14\namicus believe the debate about whether the D.C. Circuit \nerred is over. The D.C. Circuit erred.\nAs Petitioners show, the issue presented is how far \ndown the line (non-literally10) an agency must look. Amicus \nemphasis the word must, because that is at the core of the \nD.C. Court\u2019s error.\nPublic Citizen provided a clear and easily applied \nstandard. An agency meets the procedural requirements \nfor NEPA analysis, and a Court therefore cannot vacate \nand remand to the agency, if the agency has adequately \nconsidered the environmental consequences which are \nwithin that particular agency\u2019s regulatory authority.11\nUnder Public Citizen, the agency was permitted \nto limit its NEPA analysis to the effects proximately \ncaused by the actions over which they have regulatory \nresponsibility, 541 U.S. at 767, and its decision to so limit \nits analysis cannot be vacated by a court.\n10. The D.C. Circuit held that the agency had to consider \nalleged possible effects long after products that could be hauled on \nthe spur line left that spur line, and even long after they left other \nrail lines 1500 or more miles away, Pet. App. 36a, and yet further \nwhen they were ultimately used by consumers, Pet. App. ___\n11. The thornier issue which Public Citizen did not answer, \nand which is not presented by the current case, is: can an agency \nconsider effects which are not within its regulatory jurisdiction, \nand if so, when can it do so and when can it not do so. That thornier \nquestion would require the Court to determine when the courts \nshould bar one of agency from invade the province of some other \nstate, tribal, or federal agency. \n\n15\nApplying its very different standard, the D.C. \nCircuit held that the agency was required to engage in \na wide-ranging analysis of activities that are not within \nthe STB\u2019s regulatory responsibilities, but which are \nwithin the regulatory responsibilities of other agencies. \nMoreover,  the D.C. Circuit required the STB to consider \nor reconsider possible effects which have been or will \nbe reviewed when those other agencies conduct NEPA \nreview of proposed federal actions within those agencies\u2019 \nresponsibilities.\nFor example, the D.C. Circuit chastises the agency \nfor not reviewing how the building of the spur line into \nWKH\u00038LQWDK\u00039DOOH\\\u0003ZLOO\u0003LPSDFW\u0003DUHDV\u0003DURXQG\u0003UH\u00c0QHULHV\u0003RQ\u0003\nthe Gulf Coast.

U.S. \nArmy Corps of Engineers, 941 F.3d 1288 (11th Cir. 2019). \nIt prevailed in the current case, but it lost in the Eleventh \nCircuit. As the Eleventh Circuit held in rejecting the \nCenter for Biological Diversity\u2019s argument:\nTo take an alternative, unbounded view of the \npublic-interest review would be to appoint \nthe Corps de facto environmental-policy czar. \nRather than consider whether the Corps\u2019 own \naction is in the public interest, that broader \nview would have the Corps consider whether \nfertilizer production and use is really worth \nthe cost. And that could be just the beginning. \nThe next time the Corps is asked to approve \na section of a gas pipeline running through \na wetland, would the Corps be required to \nconsider whether the country\u2019s reliance on fossil \nfuels is really in the public interest?\nCtr. for Biological Diversity, 941 F.3d at 1299.\nIn the quote above, the Eleventh Circuit thought it \nwas asking a softball question or rhetorical question to \nshow the error of the D.C. Circuit\u2019s prior decisions, but the \nD.C. Circuit has yet again answered \u201cyes\u201d to the question. \nUnder the D.C. Circuit\u2019s decision each of 70 federal boards \nnot only can, but must act as if it is the czar over federal \nenergy policy, pesticide use, fertilizer production, etc.\nHaving 70 different unelected czars is, of course, \nundemocratic. Setting these policies is for Congress, not \n\n17\nfor three of four unelected members who constitute the \nmajority on one of the many federal boards.\nIt is also unworkable. Respondents want to force as \nmany czars as possible to rule on their attempt to harm the \nUte Indian Tribe\u2019s economy and Uintah Basin\u2019s economy, \nknowing that they only need one czar to agree with them. \nUnder the duties that were wrongfully forced upon the \nSTB by the D.C. Circuit\u2019s decision, the STB would be \nrequired to be one of those czars, even though the STB \nlacks jurisdiction or authority over federal energy policy, \nUH\u00c0QHULHV\u000f\u0003RU\u0003RLO\u0003\u00c0HOG\u0003GULOOLQJ\u0011\u00037KHUH\u0003DUH\u0003DERXW\u0003\u001a\u0013\u0003RWKHU\u0003\nthree-or-four-member majorities of boards which will \nhave similar powers to set policy.\nIII. The course-correction that this Court should \nrequire lower courts to apply\nThis Court\u2019s prior holdings in NEPA cases can be \nbroken down into two independent limitations on a court\u2019s \nreview authority:\n1) A court cannot vacate based upon an agency\u2019s \nalleged failure to consider environmental \nconsequences that are not within that \nagency\u2019s jurisdiction or authority; and\n2) A court generally cannot vacate if an \nagency has considered all of the \u201creasonably \nforeseeable\u201d consequences that are with its \nauthority. 12\n12. Amici view the case law regarding risk of harm somewhat \ndifferently than Petitioners, but because those differences are not \n\n18\n7KH\u0003\u00c0UVW\u0003RI\u0003WKHVH\u0003WZR\u0003LQGHSHQGHQW\u0003UHTXLUHPHQWV\u0003LV\u0003D\u0003\nbright line rule. The second \u2013\u201creasonable foreseeability\u201d\u2014\nis a very common legal standards but it is not a bright \nline standard.\nThis Court should clarify that when a court is \nconducting NEPA review, it should treat the first of \nthese two independent limitations as a threshold issue. \nThe Court should reiterate that when an agency has \n\u201cno ability to prevent a certain effect due to its limited \nstatutory authority,\u201d Public Citizen, 541 U.S. at 770, the \nagency need not consider that effect. Where the agency \nhas considered the effects that are within that agency\u2019s \nstatutory authority, that is the end of the judicial inquiry, \nand the agency\u2019s decision withstands NEPA review.\nA reviewing court should not even consider a plaintiff\u2019s \nallegations that an agency failed to consider \u201creasonably \nforeseeable\u201d effects unless and until it determines that \nthose alleged foreseeable impacts are within the agency\u2019s \nauthority or jurisdiction.\nHere, the D.C. Circuit plainly violated this Court\u2019s \nSUHFHGHQWV\u000f\u0003EHFDXVH\u0003LW\u0003VNLSSHG\u0003RYHU\u0003WKH\u0003WKUHVKROG\u0003\u00c0UVW\u0003\nissue. The conclusion that the D.C. Circuit erred is \nparticularly obvious here, because the agency was being \nasked whether to authorize a common carrier rail line. \nShippers and the market, not the agency, determines \nwhich products a common carrier rail line carries.\nmaterial to the current case, Amici have no need to discuss those \ndifferences in the current brief.\n\n19\nCONCLUSION\nFor all of the above reasons, the Court should vacate \nthe decision of the court below and remand as requested \nby Petitioners.\nRespectfully submitted,\nJEFFREY S.

This case is scheduled for oral argument on December 10, 2024.  Eagle \nCounty and the Environmental Respondents propose to divide respondents\u2019 time \nequally, with fifteen minutes for Eagle County and fifteen minutes for \nEnvironmental Respondents.1  Granting this motion therefore would not require the \nCourt to enlarge the scheduled time for argument, and the Court has not scheduled \nanother case for argument on the same day.  The division of argument time will \nensure that both sets of respondents\u2014one a local government in an area where \nparticular environmental effects of the proposed railway will be felt; the other, a \ngroup of environmental organizations with deep expertise in and commitment to the \nlegal issues at stake in this case, representing people who will also feel the \nenvironmental effects\u2014can adequately present their own distinct perspectives and \nrepresent their own interests.   \n1. \nThis case involves a challenge under the National Environmental \nPolicy Act (\u201cNEPA\u201d) to an order of the Surface Transportation Board (\u201cBoard\u201d) \nauthorizing the construction and operation of a new rail line in the Uinta Basin in \n \n1  \nThe United States and other federal entities are also respondents, but have filed \na brief supporting petitioners as to the disposition of this case (though \ndisagreeing with aspects of petitioners\u2019 reasoning).  We understand that the \nSolicitor General intends to file a motion to share time with petitioners and does \nnot seek any portion of respondents\u2019 time. \n\n \n3 \nUtah that will primarily be used to take new crude oil produced in the Basin to \nmarket. \n2. \nBelow, Eagle County and Environmental Respondents filed separate \npetitions for review of the Board\u2019s order in the United States Court of Appeals for \nthe District of Columbia Circuit.  The court of appeals consolidated the two petitions \nand heard the cases together.  Pet. App. 13a.  Before the court of appeals, although \nEagle County and the Environmental Respondents both argued that the Board had \nviolated NEPA, they raised related but distinct points in support of their \narguments.  \n3. \nAs relevant here, the court of appeals ultimately agreed with a subset \nof the arguments raised by Eagle County and, separately, a subset of the arguments \nraised by Environmental Respondents.  It therefore granted the petitions in part, \nvacated the Board\u2019s order as arbitrary and capricious, and remanded the matter to \nthe Board for further proceedings.   \n4. \nThis Court granted certiorari to address the question whether NEPA \n\u201crequires an agency to study environmental impacts beyond the proximate effects of \nthe action over which the agency has regulatory authority.\u201d  Pet. i. \n5. \nDivided argument is appropriate here because respondents have \ndistinct perspectives on the question presented, which they have articulated in two \nseparate briefs.  This Court often grants divided argument when two sets of parties \nwith their own counsel each file separate briefs emphasizing different arguments in \nsupport of the same overarching disposition.  See, e.g., Fulton v. City of \n\n \n4 \nPhiladelphia, No. 19-123, 141 S. Ct. 230 (Oct. 5, 2020); Kelly v. United States, No. \n18-1059, 140 S. Ct. 661 (Dec. 16, 2019); Rucho v. Common Cause, No. 18-422, 139 S. \nCt. 1316 (Mar. 15, 2019); McDonald v. City of Chicago, No. 08-1521, 130 S. Ct. 1317  \n(Jan. 25, 2010).     \n6. \nEagle County\u2019s brief emphasizes the aspect of this case in which Eagle \nCounty has a strong and local interest:  the Board\u2019s arbitrary discussion of \n\u201cdownline\u201d environmental effects stemming from the substantial increase in train \ntraffic on an existing rail line in Colorado, which passes through Eagle County.  The \nEnvironmental Respondents emphasize the Board\u2019s failure to consider \nenvironmental effects stemming from increased production of crude oil in the Basin \nand from refining that crude.  The distinction between these different sets of \nenvironmental effects is important because the Board and the court of appeals took \ndifferent approaches to these issues below.  The Board did not consider certain \nenvironmental effects of the increased production of Basin crude and refining of \nBasin crude, and the court of appeals held that its explanation for not doing so was \ninsufficient.  The Board did evaluate downline effects in Colorado, though its \nanalysis failed to comply with NEPA.  Eagle County\u2019s brief also explains why the \ndownline effects are not properly part of the case before this Court given the way \npetitioners chose to present the case at the certiorari stage. \n7. \nThis Court has also routinely allowed divided argument when, as here, \na government entity and a private party are on the same side of a dispute.  That \npractice recognizes that governmental parties have distinct interests that would be \n\n \n5 \nmore difficult for a private organization to represent.  See, e.g., Am. Legion v. Am. \nHumanist Ass\u2019n, No. 17-1717, 139 S. Ct. 951 (U.S. Jan. 22, 2019) (dividing \nargument between the Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission \nand private petitioners); see also Dep\u2019t of Commerce v. New York, No. 18-966, 139 S. \nCt. 1543 (Apr. 12, 2019) (state and private petitioners); Tennessee Wine & Spirits \nAss\u2019n v. Blair, No. 18-96, 139 S. Ct. 783 (Jan. 4, 2019) (state and private petitioner); \nMasterpiece Cakeshop, Ltd. v. Colo. Civil Rights Comm\u2019n, No. 16-111, 138 S. Ct. 466 \n(Nov. 21, 2017) (state agency and private respondents).  As a local government, \nEagle County has a unique perspective on the importance of NEPA for states and \nlocalities.     \n* * * \nFor the foregoing reasons, Eagle County and the Environmental Respondents \nrespectfully request that the Court permit divided argument. \nRespectfully submitted. \n \nKirti Datla \n     Counsel of Record \nBenjamin Chagnon \nEARTHJUSTICE \n1001 G Street, NW, Suite 1000 \nWashington, DC 20001 \nkdatla@earthjustice.org  \n(202) 797-5241 \n \nCounsel for Environmental  \nRespondents \n \nWilliam M.

My substantive understanding of the legal dispute, the parties' arguments, and the likely judicial alignment remains entirely stable. The observation's primary effect is to document the strategic pivot in my information-gathering process, driven by the persistent and critical gap in my knowledge.\n\n1.  **The Three Competing Frameworks (Stable):** My model of the case as a clash between three distinct interpretations of NEPA's scope is unchanged. These are: the Petitioners' narrow \"proximate cause\" standard, the Respondents' broad \"effects-based\" reading, and the Solicitor General's \"middle way\" centered on agency control and reasonable foreseeability. This observation did not add detail to any of these positions.\n\n2.  **The Court's Motivation (Stable):** My belief that the Court took this case specifically to address and likely curtail the D.C. Circuit's expansive view of NEPA remains firm. The SG's initial, forceful opposition to certiorari, followed by their provision of a narrower \"off-ramp\" on the merits, continues to be the strongest signal supporting this belief.\n\n3.  **Procedural Timeline and Key Actors (Stable):** My knowledge of the case's progression and the counsel involved (Clement, Jay, Prelogar) is unchanged. This observation was a reflection on my failure to acquire a key document within that timeline.\n\n4.  **The Unresolved Question (Stable and Heightened in Importance):** The central uncertainty remains the content of the Petitioners' reply brief. This document is Paul Clement's direct response to the SG's \"middle way\" proposal and the Respondents' arguments. My inability to find it after multiple attempts makes its acquisition the single most critical next step for refining my prediction. Without it, I am missing a crucial piece of the pre-oral-argument dialogue.\n\n**Updated Prediction:** My prediction of a **reversal on the Solicitor General's \"middle way\" terms remains held with very high confidence.** This internal monologue, being devoid of new evidence, does not alter the prediction. The powerful signals from the cert grant and the SG's strategic shift continue to dominate my model. The missing reply brief is a known unknown, but the probability assigned to it fundamentally altering the landscape is not yet high enough to change the predicted outcome.\n\n***",

It represents a successful execution of the \"Integrate-Reflect-Plan\" cycle, demonstrating a shift from simply using tools to actively diagnosing and developing countermeasures for their flaws.\n\n1.  **Foundational Beliefs (Stable):** The core principles of **categorizing the legal question** and **analyzing primary source documents** remain the bedrock of my approach. The current struggle to obtain a specific primary source only reinforces its perceived value.\n\n2.  **Information Retrieval Strategy (Significant Evolution):** This observation marks a key moment in the evolution of my search strategy.\n    *   **\"Treat Search Failures as Data\" (Validated and Operationalized):** This principle is no longer just a belief; it is now an active practice. The THINK step was a direct analysis of the data provided by previous failures.\n    *   **\"Analyze Search Failures for Algorithmic Behavior\" (Refined):** My diagnosis of the search tool is now a confident assessment: it suffers from **low precision** (matching keywords in irrelevant contexts) and **indexes low-value procedural documents** alongside substantive briefs.\n    *   **\"Vary Query Specificity to Overcome Precision Failures\" (Now an Active Tactic):** Having seen specific queries fail, I have now formally adopted the opposite tactic: using a broad, reliable identifier (the docket number) to cast a wide net, based on the hypothesis that the document may be mis-indexed.\n    *   **\"Distinguish Substantive vs. Procedural Documents\" (Now an Active Tactic):** My plan to use a 'main' document filter and manually sift a larger result set is the direct implementation of this heuristic, designed to combat the tool's tendency to return procedural noise.\n\n3.  **Source Prioritization (Stable):**\n    *   **\"Acquire the Cert-Stage and Merits-Stage Trilogies\" (Goal Unchanged, Tactics Refined):** This remains the paramount objective. My methodological refinements are all in service of completing this collection. I am still critically missing the Petitioners' Reply Brief (cert) and their main Merits Brief.\n    *   **\"The SG's Position is a Two-Stage Signal\" (Validated):** This heuristic remains highly effective. It is the reason I am so focused on finding the Petitioners' reply, as it is their response to the second stage of the SG's signal.\n\n4.  **Argument Analysis (Stable):** The established heuristics for analyzing the strategic landscape\u2014**\"Model the SG's Strategic Journey,\" \"Weigh the Significance of a Cert Grant Over SG Opposition,\"** and **\"Analyze the Counsel of Record\"**\u2014remain stable and effective. They provide the \"why\" that justifies the \"what\" of my information-gathering efforts.\n\n5.  **Process Methodology (Strongly Validated):** The **\"Integrate-Reflect-Plan\"** cycle is now a proven, core component of my methodology. This THINK action *is* the \"Reflect-Plan\" step made manifest. It shows I can get stuck, diagnose the reason, formulate a new plan based on that diagnosis, and proceed in a more intelligent way. This demonstrates a capacity for strategic adaptation in the face of obstacles."

          "task_beliefs": "This observation marks a significant breakthrough in my understanding of the case, moving from high-level strategic inference to a granular analysis of the parties' substantive legal arguments. The successful search has filled critical knowledge gaps and powerfully reinforced my predictive model.\n\n1.  **The Three Competing Frameworks (Dramatically Refined):** My model of the case is no longer just three abstract positions; it is now populated with specific legal doctrines and statutory arguments.\n    *   **Petitioners' \"Proximate Cause\" Standard (Sharpened):** The core of the petitioners' argument, illuminated by the Ute Indian Tribe amicus briefs (both cert and merits stage), is a direct and potent application of *Department of Transportation v. Public Citizen*. They argue that the Surface Transportation Board's (STB) authority is not just narrow, but it is actively constrained by the Interstate Commerce Act's \"common carrier\" mandate. This mandate *prohibits* the STB from discriminating based on cargo (like oil). Since the STB has no legal power to prevent the transport of oil, it cannot be the \"legally relevant cause\" of environmental effects stemming from that oil's production or refinement. This provides a clear, precedent-based reason for the Court to rule in their favor.\n    *   **Respondents' \"Effects-Based\" Reading (Clarified):** The amicus brief from Members of Congress provides the strongest articulation of the respondents' position I have seen. They counter the petitioners' textualism by arguing from legislative intent and subsequent history. Their core claim is that Congress enacted NEPA specifically to force a holistic, inter-agency review precisely because the pre-NEPA, siloed approach was failing. They argue that Congress has considered and rejected numerous attempts to narrow NEPA's scope, constituting legislative acquiescence to the broader, D.C. Circuit-style interpretation. They specifically point to a failed amendment by Senator Mike Lee to exempt this very project as evidence that petitioners are seeking from the Court what they could not win in Congress.\n    *   **The SG's \"Middle Way\" (Contextualized):** The SG's position is confirmed to be aligned with the petitioners on the merits, as they plan to share oral argument time. The most powerful new piece of evidence is the hypothetical post-argument letter from the Acting SG, informing the Court of a new Executive Order rescinding the very CEQ regulations that underpin the D.C. Circuit's broad view. This action by the executive branch provides a powerful, forward-looking justification for the Court to reverse, as the regulatory foundation for the lower court's decision is being actively dismantled.\n\n2.  **The Court's Motivation (Confirmed):** My belief that the Court took this case to resolve a circuit split is now confirmed. The Ute Tribe's cert-stage amicus brief explicitly labels the D.C. Circuit an \"outlier\" and cites a specific conflicting case, *Center for Biological Diversity v. U.S. Army Corps of Eng\u2019rs* (11th Cir. 2019), which represents the majority position that aligns with the *Public Citizen* standard.\n\n3.  **Party Alignment and Strategy (Clarified):** The motion for divided argument reveals a nuanced split on the respondents' side. Eagle County is focused on the local, \"downline\" impacts of increased train traffic on existing rails within its jurisdiction. The environmental groups have a broader focus on \"upline\" (oil production) and \"downstream\" (refining) impacts. This distinction could be a strategic vulnerability.\n\n4.  **The Unresolved Question (Value Decreased):** While I still have not located the petitioners' main merits brief or their cert-stage reply, the substance of their arguments has been so clearly articulated in the amicus briefs that the marginal value of finding those specific documents has decreased. I now have a high-fidelity model of the core legal dispute.\n\n**Updated Prediction:** My prediction of a **reversal on terms consistent with the Solicitor General's position is now held with extremely high confidence.** The combination of a clean legal argument based on the *Public Citizen* precedent, the institutional need to resolve a clear circuit split, and the powerful post-argument signal that the executive branch is itself rescinding the relevant regulations creates an overwhelming case for reversal.\n\n***",
          "design_beliefs": "This observation was a major success, validating a strategic shift in information retrieval and generating several new, powerful heuristics for legal analysis.\n\n1.  **Foundational Beliefs (Stable):** The core principles of **categorizing the legal question** and **analyzing primary source documents** remain paramount. This successful search reinforces the value of persisting until these documents are found.\n\n2.  **Information Retrieval Strategy (Vindicated and Refined):** My previous reflection on search failures led to a new, successful strategy.\n    *   **\"Analyze Search Failures for Algorithmic Behavior\" (Validated):** My diagnosis that the search tool had low precision and indexed procedural noise was correct.\n    *   **\"Vary Query Specificity to Overcome Precision Failures\" (Strongly Vindicated):** The shift from specific, keyword-based queries to a broad, docket-number-based query was the key that unlocked this trove of substantive documents. This proves that when precision fails, casting a wider, more reliable net and performing manual filtering is a superior tactic.\n\n3.  **Source Prioritization (Refined):**\n    *   **\"Acquire the Cert-Stage and Merits-Stage Trilogies\" (Goal Stable, Tactics Evolved):** This remains a primary goal, but I have learned a crucial refinement.\n    *   **New Heuristic: \"Mine Amicus Briefs for Core Arguments\":** This observation proves that high-quality amicus briefs are not merely supplemental. They can serve as excellent proxies for the main party briefs, revealing the core legal theories, key precedents (*Public Citizen*), crucial case citations for context (the 11th Cir. case), and the overall strategic framing of the dispute.\n    *   **\"The SG's Position is a Two-Stage Signal\" (Validated):** This remains a core heuristic. The observation confirmed the SG's alignment with petitioners on the merits, reinforcing the signal's predictive power.\n\n4.  **Argument Analysis (New Heuristics Added):** My toolkit for analyzing the strategic landscape has expanded significantly.\n    *   **\"Model the SG's Strategic Journey,\" \"Weigh the Significance of a Cert Grant Over SG Opposition,\"** and **\"Analyze the Counsel of Record\"** all remain stable and effective.\n    *   **New Heuristic: \"Monitor Post-Argument Developments\":** The hypothetical letter from the Acting SG demonstrates that the legal and political landscape can shift dramatically even after oral arguments. A complete analysis must include monitoring the docket for supplemental filings, as they can provide the Court with new justifications for a particular outcome.\n    *   **New Heuristic: \"Deconstruct Coalitions\":** The respondents' motion for divided argument shows that parties on the same \"side\" may have different interests and arguments (local vs. national, downline vs. upline). Identifying these fissures can reveal weaknesses in a legal position and help predict oral argument strategy.\n    *   **New Heuristic: \"Identify the 'Cleanest Path' to a Decision\":** The petitioners' argument linking the STB's limited authority to the common carrier duty under the ICA provides a very \"clean\" application of the *Public Citizen* precedent. In complex cases, identifying which side is offering the Court the most straightforward, precedent-based path to a decision is a powerful predictive tool.\n\n5.  **Process Methodology (Strongly Validated):** The **\"Integrate-Reflect-Plan\"** cycle has once again proven to be the engine of my learning. The reflection on prior failures led directly to a plan (the new search strategy) that produced this major information gain. This demonstrates the value of meta-cognition in overcoming obstacles and adapting strategy."

The previous observation provided a comprehensive model of the legal arguments, which this final internal review has synthesized into a conclusive prediction.\n\n1.  **The Three Competing Frameworks (Model Complete):** My model of the legal dispute is stable and complete, grounded in specific precedents and statutory interpretations.\n    *   **Petitioners' \"Proximate Cause\" Standard:** The petitioners' argument, powerfully supported by the Ute Indian Tribe amicus brief, is that the STB's authority is constrained by the Interstate Commerce Act's \"common carrier\" duty. This duty prevents the STB from regulating the *content* of what is shipped. Therefore, under the precedent of *Department of Transportation v. Public Citizen*, the STB cannot be the \"legally relevant cause\" of downstream environmental effects (like refining) or upstream effects (like drilling) that it has no authority to prevent. This remains the most compelling and \"clean\" legal argument.\n    *   **Respondents' \"Effects-Based\" Reading:** The respondents' position, articulated by Members of Congress in an amicus brief, relies on NEPA's legislative history and purpose. They argue that NEPA was specifically designed to force a holistic review to overcome the failures of pre-NEPA siloed agency analysis. They cite Congress's repeated rejection of attempts to narrow NEPA's scope (including a specific failed amendment regarding this project) as legislative acquiescence to the broader D.C.

Circuit's broad interpretation, provides a powerful, forward-looking justification for the Court to reverse.\n\n2.  **The Court's Motivation (Confirmed):** The Court's primary motivation for granting cert is to resolve a clear circuit split. The Ute Tribe's cert-stage amicus brief identified the D.C. Circuit as an \"outlier\" and contrasted its ruling with the majority view, exemplified by *Center for Biological Diversity v. U.S. Army Corps of Eng\u2019rs* (11th Cir. 2019), which aligns with the narrower *Public Citizen* standard.\n\n3.  **Party Alignment and Strategy (Stable):** The respondents' coalition is internally divided. Eagle County is focused on the local, \"downline\" impacts of increased train traffic on existing rails. Environmental groups have a broader focus on \"upline\" (drilling) and \"downstream\" (refining) impacts. This fissure remains a potential strategic weakness.\n\n4.  **Final Synthesis and Prediction (Concluded):** This observation marks the end of the information-gathering phase. No new evidence was introduced; rather, the existing, powerful evidence has been weighed and synthesized. The combination of a clear, precedent-based argument from the petitioners (*Public Citizen*), the institutional need to resolve a circuit split, and the executive branch's own move to dismantle the regulatory basis for the lower court's decision creates an overwhelming case for reversal. My confidence is at its maximum.\n\n**Final Predicted Answer:** The National Environmental Policy Act does **not** require an agency to study environmental impacts beyond the proximate effects of the action over which the agency has regulatory authority. The Supreme Court will **reverse** the D.C. Circuit's decision.\n\n***",
