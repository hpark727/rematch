      "Does the First Step Act\u2019s sentencing reduction provision apply to a defendant whose original sentence was imposed before the Act\u2019s enactment, but was later vacated and resentenced after the Act took effect?"

    "facts_of_the_case": "In 2009, Corey Deyon Duffey, Jarvis Dupree Ross, and Tony R. Hewitt were convicted of multiple counts of conspiracy, attempted bank robbery, bank robbery, and using firearms in furtherance of these crimes under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c). After appeals and resentencing, they received mandatory minimum sentences of 5 years for their first \u00a7 924(c) conviction and 25 years for each subsequent conviction, as per the law at that time which allowed \u201cstacking\u201d of these charges.\n\nIn 2020, following the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in United States v. Davis, the appellants successfully filed for habeas relief. The district court vacated their \u00a7 924(c) conspiracy convictions and ordered resentencing. Before their resentencing in 2022, the appellants argued that \u00a7 403 of the First Step Act of 2018, which eliminated sentence stacking for \u00a7 924(c) convictions, should apply to their cases. The government initially opposed this view but later changed its position to support the application of \u00a7 403. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit rejected their challenges and affirmed the convictions.",

The key precedents governing statutory retroactivity, especially in the criminal sentencing context.\n3.  The reasoning of the Fifth Circuit for denying the application of \u00a7 403.\n4.  The petitioner's core arguments for why the Fifth Circuit was wrong.\n5.  The government's reasoning for changing its position to support the petitioner.

This detailed plan dramatically increases the efficiency and effectiveness of subsequent information-gathering actions, thereby substantially reducing uncertainty about the case-specific parameters (\u03b8).\n\nFor Design EIG (0.6), the action explicitly formulates hypotheses about general predictive strategies (D). It identifies key meta-level factors like the predictive power of the Solicitor General's change of position, the Court's general approach to sentencing reform, and the role of judicial philosophies. This frames the task not just as a one-off prediction but as an opportunity to learn generalizable patterns in judicial decision-making.\n\nThe joint EIG is high because this planning phase is fundamental to both reducing task-specific uncertainty and improving the agent's general predictive model. It lays the groundwork for all subsequent, more targeted actions.",

However, the beliefs are internally consistent and well-aligned with the agent's current state of ignorance and its plan to gather information, so coherence is relatively high (0.8).

Reading the petitioner's brief will reveal their specific legal arguments, their interpretation of the statutory text of \u00a7 403, the precedents they rely on, and their refutation of the lower court's reasoning. This is a foundational piece of evidence for making any prediction. The Design EIG is moderate. My current design hypothesis is that prioritizing primary source documents (like briefs) is a highly effective strategy. Executing this action and finding it to be information-rich will provide strong confirmatory evidence for this design principle, reinforcing its importance and priority in the workflow. However, it is confirming an existing hypothesis rather than revealing a novel one. The joint EIG is therefore high, as this action is a critical step in understanding the specific case while also validating a generalizable strategic approach.",

App. 1a-16a) is pub-\nlished at 92 F.4th 304. \nJURISDICTION \nThe Fifth Circuit entered judgment on February 2, \n2024. Petitioner filed a petition for a writ of certiorari on \nMarch 8, 2024, which the Court granted on July 2, 2024. \nThe Court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254(1). \nSTATUTORY PROVISION INVOLVED \nThe relevant provisions of the First Step Act of 2018, \nPub. L. No. 115-391, 132 Stat. 5194, are reproduced in the \npetition appendix at pages 17a-21a. \nINTRODUCTION \nSection 924(c) of title 18 of the U.S. Code authorizes \ndrastic mandatory minimum sentences for those who \ncommit certain federal crimes while carrying, brandish-\ning, or discharging a firearm. For first offenses, it calls for \na mandatory minimum sentence between five and ten \nyears\u2019 imprisonment. For second or subsequent offenses, \nthat number jumps to 25 years. The statute requires that \nthe sentence for each section 924(c) count run consecu-\ntively with any other sentence. \nIn Deal v. United States, 508 U.S. 129 (1993), the \nCourt held that section 924(c), as originally enacted, \nrequired imposition of the 25-year mandatory minimum if \na defendant was convicted of multiple section 924(c) \ncounts in a single criminal proceeding. Thus, even a first-\ntime offender, if charged with multiple section 924(c) \ncounts, could face multiple 25-year sentences, running \nconsecutively. This effect, which often resulted in de facto \nlife sentences for first-time offenders, came to be known \nas \u201cstacking.\u201d \nStacking was widely regarded as unjust and irration-\nal. As one district court noted, a first-time, nonviolent \noffender who carried a firearm during a string of simple \n\n2 \n \ndrug sales would face more prison time than a murderer. \nCongress finally answered the calls for corrective action \nwith the First Step Act of 2018 (FSA). A principal aim of \nthe law was to end stacking. To that end, section 403(a) \nof the FSA amended section 924(c) to abrogate Deal, so \nthat the statute now permits enhanced sentences only \n\u201c[i]n the case of a violation of this subsection that occurs \nafter a prior conviction under this subsection has become \nfinal.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c). As a result, now only true \nrecidivists may be sentenced to section 924(c)\u2019s enhan-\nced 25-year mandatory minimum. \nBut under 1 U.S.C. \u00a7 109, the default rule for such \nsentencing reforms is that they apply only to crimes com-\nmitted after enactment. Appreciating the grave injustice \nthat would result if stacking were allowed to continue in \npost-enactment sentencings for pre-enactment conduct, \nCongress overrode the default rule, making section \n403(a)\u2019s sentencing reform retroactive. It thus adopted \nsection 403(b), which specifies that section 403(a) \u201cshall \napply to any offense that was committed before the date \nof enactment of this Act, if a sentence for the offense has \nnot been imposed as of such date of enactment.\u201d  \nAll agree that this language makes section 403(a) \nrelief available to a defendant who committed an offense \npre-enactment but is sentenced post-enactment. All also \nagree that it does not make relief available to anyone who \ncommitted an offense pre-enactment and whose sentence \nand judgment of conviction were final on the date of \nenactment and remain so today. The only question here is \nwhether it makes section 403(a) relief available to a \ndefendant who was sentenced pre-enactment, but whose \ninitial sentence was thereafter vacated, rendering the \ninitial sentence void ab initio and necessitating post-\nenactment plenary resentencing. \nThe plain text of section 403(b) supplies the answer: \nIt does. As a starting point, \u201ca sentence for the offense\u201d \n\n3 \n \ndoes not\u2014cannot\u2014include a sentence that has been \nvacated. A vacated sentence is a nullity, one treated by \noperation of law as never having been imposed. The point \nof vacatur is to ensure that the object has no legal effect \nand works no ongoing prejudice. Congress is presumed to \nunderstand and incorporate background legal principles \nlike this and thus could not have intended \u201ca sentence\u201d to \ninclude a vacated sentence. \nThis is confirmed by the statutory context, including \nthe verb tense and preposition that Congress used. The \npresent-perfect tense, used together with the preposition \n\u201cas of,\u201d indicates that Congress sought to deny section \n403(a)\u2019s reforms only to those defendants whose judg-\nments of conviction were final on the date of enactment \nand remain so today. As the government now agrees, no \nordinary English speaker would say that a sentence \u201chas \nbeen imposed as of December 21, 2018\u201d if the sentence \nwas vacated and no longer has any force or effect.  \nReading section 403(b) as drawing a line between \npending and past cases reflects Congress\u2019s evident desire \nto respect the finality of judgments. But finality is not an \nissue when a judgment is vacated for reasons independent \nof the FSA; such a case is \u201cpending\u201d like any other. That \nis confirmed by post-vacatur practice, which calls for an \nentirely new, de novo proceeding at which Congress could \nnot have intended stacking to remain available.  \nNone of the contrary rationales supplied by the court \nbelow or by the Sixth and Eleventh Circuits is persuasive. \nThose courts\u2019 rationales would revise the statute\u2019s \nlanguage and blinder the Court to the statute\u2019s context, \nstructure, and manifest purpose, reading section 403(b) \nto defeat Congress\u2019s design rather than to conform to it. \nThis Court\u2019s cases require no such result. If there were \nany doubt about that, the rule of lenity would require \nresolving it in petitioner\u2019s favor and thus reversing the \ndecision below. \n\n4 \n \nSTATEMENT \nA. Legal background \n1. Section 924(c) of title 18 of the U.S. Code crim-\ninalizes the use, carrying, or possession of a firearm in \nconnection with a \u201ccrime of violence or drug trafficking \ncrime.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A).  \nConviction for a first section 924(c) violation carries \na mandatory minimum sentence of five years for offenders \nwho carry or possess a firearm during a crime of violence \nor a drug trafficking crime. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A)(i). \nAs originally enacted and through December 21, 2018, a \nconviction for a \u201csecond or subsequent\u201d 924(c) violation \ncarried a mandatory minimum sentence of 25 years. Id. \n\u00a7 924(c)(1)(C). Moreover, when a defendant is convicted \nof violating section 924(c), the statute\u2019s mandatory \nminimum sentence must run consecutively rather than \nconcurrently \u201cwith any other term of imprisonment.\u201d Id. \n\u00a7 924(c)(1)(D)(ii).  \nIn Deal v. United States, 508 U.S. 129 (1993), the \nCourt interpreted section 924(c)\u2019s \u201csecond or subse-\nquent\u201d language to apply to multiple 924(c) convictions \nobtained in a single criminal proceeding. See 508 U.S. at \n134 (rejecting the contention that that section \u201c924(c)(1) \nmust be read to impose the enhanced sentence only for an \noffense committed after a previous sentence has become \nfinal\u201d). In other words, according to the Court, a \ndefendant could commit an initial and \u201csubsequent\u201d \noffense as part of a single criminal transaction prosecuted \nin a single case. The Court thus rejected the notion that \nsection 924(c) was intended to punish only recidivists \nand held that a defendant with no prior criminal history \ncould receive enhanced, consecutive sentences for each \nsection 924(c) count charged. Ibid. \nGiven its lengthy minimum consecutive penalties, \nsection 924(c) threatened exceptionally \u201clong prison sen-\n\n5 \n \ntences for anyone who uses a firearm in connection with \ncertain other federal crimes.\u201d United States v. Davis, 588 \nU.S. 445, 448 (2019). The practice of \u201ccharging multiple \nviolations of section 924(c) within the same indictment\u201d \nbecame known as \u201cstacking.\u201d See U.S. Sentencing Com-\nmission, Mandatory Minimum Penalties for Firearm \nOffenses in the Federal Criminal Justice System 271 (Oct. \n2011) (hereinafter USSC Report). Because each count \nbeyond the first was subject to the enhanced 25-year \nminimum penalty, stacking often resulted in de facto life \nsentences for first-time section 924(c) offenders\u2014often \nseveral hundred years\u2019 imprisonment imposed all at once. \nAs one court noted, a first-time offender frequently would \nreceive a lighter sentence \u201cif he had committed murder\u201d \nrather than a series of nonviolent drug sales while carry-\ning a firearm. United States v. Holloway, 68 F. Supp. 3d \n310, 313 (E.D.N.Y. 2014). \nStacking was widely criticized as unjust. District \njudges\u2014those on the front lines of the federal criminal \njustice system\u2014objected to having to impose what they \nviewed as drastic and disproportionate sentences for first-\ntime (and often nonviolent) offenders. See, e.g., United \nStates v. Angelos, 345 F. Supp. 2d 1227, 1230-33 (D. Utah \n2004) (having to sentence the defendant, a \u201ctwenty-four-\nyear-old first offender who is a successful music execu-\ntive with two young children,\u201d to \u201cprison for the rest of \nhis life is unjust, cruel, and even irrational\u201d). \nCircuit judges likewise expressed great discomfort \nhaving to affirm \u201cirrational, inhumane, and absurd\u201d \nsentences that were \u201ca predictable by-product of the cruel \nand unjust mandatory minimum sentencing scheme \nadopted by Congress.\u201d United States v. Hungerford, 465 \nF.3d 1113, 1118 (9th Cir. 2006) (Reinhardt, J., con-\ncurring); see also, e.g., United States v. Hunter, 770 F.3d \n740, 746-747 (8th Cir. 2014) (Bright, J., concurring) \n(decrying the sentence imposed as \u201cout of this world\u201d and \n\n6 \n \n\u201cjoin[ing] in the litany of criticisms directed towards\u201d the \n\u201coverly harsh\u201d practice of sentence stacking). \nJudges and commentators observed that, beyond the \nundue harshness of mandatory minimum sentences, the \nlaw also produced wildly divergent sentencing outcomes \nbased on mere geography\u2014prosecutors in some jurisdic-\ntions used stacking as a matter of course, while others \nmore often avoided it. See In re Hernandez, 857 F.3d \n1162, 1169 (11th Cir. 2017) (Martin, J., concurring) \n(explaining that the defendant \u201cmight never have \nreceived this sentence if he had been sentenced in another \npart of the country\u201d). And prosecutors frequently used \nthe threat of stacked sentences to induce defendants to \naccept plea deals, thus forfeiting their Sixth Amendment \nright to a jury trial, adding constitutional insult to \nstatutory injury. See Human Rights Watch, An Offer You \nCan\u2019t Refuse: How US Federal Prosecutors Force Drug \nDefendants to Plead Guilty (2013). \nAmong those calling for reform was the Sentencing \nCommission itself. USSC Report 359-362. In a report to \nCongress, the Commission explained that \u201c[t]he \u2018stack-\ning\u2019 of mandatory minimum penalties for multiple viola-\ntions of section 924(c) results in excessively severe and \nunjust sentences in some cases.\u201d Id. at 359. In many of \nthose cases, \u201cthe offense did not involve any physical \nharm or threat of physical harm to a person.\u201d Ibid. The \nCommission noted that the Judicial Conference had, on \nmultiple occasions, urged Congress \u201cto amend the \n\u2018draconian\u2019 penalties established at section 924(c).\u201d Id. \nat 360-361 (quoting Mandatory Minimums and Unin-\ntended Consequences: Hearing on H.R. 2934, H.R. 834, \nand H.R. 1466 Before the Subcommittee on Crime, \nTerrorism, and Homeland Security of the House Commit-\ntee on the Judiciary, 111th Cong. 35 (2009)); see also \nHearing Before the Over-Criminalization Task Force of \n2014 of the House Committee on the Judiciary, 113th \n\n7 \n \nCong. 23 (2014) (testimony of Hon. Irene M. Keeley, \nJudicial Conference of the United States). \n2. Although it took several attempts over nearly a \ndecade, Congress finally heeded the Sentencing Commis-\nsion\u2019s call to action in 2018. Late that year, it enacted and \nPresident Trump signed the First Step Act, which was the \n\u201cproduct of a remarkable bipartisan effort.\u201d United States \nv. Henry, 983 F.3d 214, 218 (6th Cir. 2020). The \nculmination of work by an \u201cextraordinary political coali-\ntion\u201d (164 Cong. Rec. S7645 (daily ed. Dec. 17, 2018) \n(statement of Sen. Durbin)), the FSA made \u201conce-in-a-\ngeneration reforms to America\u2019s prison and sentencing \nsystem\u201d (Senate Passes Landmark Criminal Justice \nReform, U.S. Senate Committee on the Judiciary (Dec. \n18, 2018)). \nSection 403 of the FSA addresses sentence stacking. \nIts well-recognized purpose is \u201cto remedy past over-\nzealous use of mandatory-minimum sentences\u201d under \nsection 924(c). Henry, 983 F.3d at 218. To that end, \nsection 403(a) amends section 924(c) to clarify that the\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

App. 1a-16a) is pub-\nlished at 92 F.4th 304. \nJURISDICTION \nThe Fifth Circuit entered judgment on February 2, \n2024. Petitioner filed a petition for a writ of certiorari on \nMarch 8, 2024, which the Court granted on July 2, 2024. \nThe Court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254(1). \nSTATUTORY PROVISION INVOLVED \nThe relevant provisions of the First Step Act of 2018, \nPub. L. No. 115-391, 132 Stat. 5194, are reproduced in the \npetition appendix at pages 17a-21a. \nINTRODUCTION \nSection 924(c) of title 18 of the U.S. Code authorizes \ndrastic mandatory minimum sentences for those who \ncommit certain federal crimes while carrying, brandish-\ning, or discharging a firearm. For first offenses, it calls for \na mandatory minimum sentence between five and ten \nyears\u2019 imprisonment. For second or subsequent offenses, \nthat number jumps to 25 years. The statute requires that \nthe sentence for each section 924(c) count run consecu-\ntively with any other sentence. \nIn Deal v. United States, 508 U.S. 129 (1993), the \nCourt held that section 924(c), as originally enacted, \nrequired imposition of the 25-year mandatory minimum if \na defendant was convicted of multiple section 924(c) \ncounts in a single criminal proceeding. Thus, even a first-\ntime offender, if charged with multiple section 924(c) \ncounts, could face multiple 25-year sentences, running \nconsecutively. This effect, which often resulted in de facto \nlife sentences for first-time offenders, came to be known \nas \u201cstacking.\u201d \nStacking was widely regarded as unjust and irration-\nal. As one district court noted, a first-time, nonviolent \noffender who carried a firearm during a string of simple \n\n2 \n \ndrug sales would face more prison time than a murderer. \nCongress finally answered the calls for corrective action \nwith the First Step Act of 2018 (FSA). A principal aim of \nthe law was to end stacking. To that end, section 403(a) \nof the FSA amended section 924(c) to abrogate Deal, so \nthat the statute now permits enhanced sentences only \n\u201c[i]n the case of a violation of this subsection that occurs \nafter a prior conviction under this subsection has become \nfinal.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c). As a result, now only true \nrecidivists may be sentenced to section 924(c)\u2019s enhan-\nced 25-year mandatory minimum. \nBut under 1 U.S.C. \u00a7 109, the default rule for such \nsentencing reforms is that they apply only to crimes com-\nmitted after enactment. Appreciating the grave injustice \nthat would result if stacking were allowed to continue in \npost-enactment sentencings for pre-enactment conduct, \nCongress overrode the default rule, making section \n403(a)\u2019s sentencing reform retroactive. It thus adopted \nsection 403(b), which specifies that section 403(a) \u201cshall \napply to any offense that was committed before the date \nof enactment of this Act, if a sentence for the offense has \nnot been imposed as of such date of enactment.\u201d  \nAll agree that this language makes section 403(a) \nrelief available to a defendant who committed an offense \npre-enactment but is sentenced post-enactment. All also \nagree that it does not make relief available to anyone who \ncommitted an offense pre-enactment and whose sentence \nand judgment of conviction were final on the date of \nenactment and remain so today. The only question here is \nwhether it makes section 403(a) relief available to a \ndefendant who was sentenced pre-enactment, but whose \ninitial sentence was thereafter vacated, rendering the \ninitial sentence void ab initio and necessitating post-\nenactment plenary resentencing. \nThe plain text of section 403(b) supplies the answer: \nIt does. As a starting point, \u201ca sentence for the offense\u201d \n\n3 \n \ndoes not\u2014cannot\u2014include a sentence that has been \nvacated. A vacated sentence is a nullity, one treated by \noperation of law as never having been imposed. The point \nof vacatur is to ensure that the object has no legal effect \nand works no ongoing prejudice. Congress is presumed to \nunderstand and incorporate background legal principles \nlike this and thus could not have intended \u201ca sentence\u201d to \ninclude a vacated sentence. \nThis is confirmed by the statutory context, including \nthe verb tense and preposition that Congress used. The \npresent-perfect tense, used together with the preposition \n\u201cas of,\u201d indicates that Congress sought to deny section \n403(a)\u2019s reforms only to those defendants whose judg-\nments of conviction were final on the date of enactment \nand remain so today. As the government now agrees, no \nordinary English speaker would say that a sentence \u201chas \nbeen imposed as of December 21, 2018\u201d if the sentence \nwas vacated and no longer has any force or effect.  \nReading section 403(b) as drawing a line between \npending and past cases reflects Congress\u2019s evident desire \nto respect the finality of judgments. But finality is not an \nissue when a judgment is vacated for reasons independent \nof the FSA; such a case is \u201cpending\u201d like any other. That \nis confirmed by post-vacatur practice, which calls for an \nentirely new, de novo proceeding at which Congress could \nnot have intended stacking to remain available.  \nNone of the contrary rationales supplied by the court \nbelow or by the Sixth and Eleventh Circuits is persuasive. \nThose courts\u2019 rationales would revise the statute\u2019s \nlanguage and blinder the Court to the statute\u2019s context, \nstructure, and manifest purpose, reading section 403(b) \nto defeat Congress\u2019s design rather than to conform to it. \nThis Court\u2019s cases require no such result. If there were \nany doubt about that, the rule of lenity would require \nresolving it in petitioner\u2019s favor and thus reversing the \ndecision below. \n\n4 \n \nSTATEMENT \nA. Legal background \n1. Section 924(c) of title 18 of the U.S. Code crim-\ninalizes the use, carrying, or possession of a firearm in \nconnection with a \u201ccrime of violence or drug trafficking \ncrime.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A).  \nConviction for a first section 924(c) violation carries \na mandatory minimum sentence of five years for offenders \nwho carry or possess a firearm during a crime of violence \nor a drug trafficking crime. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A)(i). \nAs originally enacted and through December 21, 2018, a \nconviction for a \u201csecond or subsequent\u201d 924(c) violation \ncarried a mandatory minimum sentence of 25 years. Id. \n\u00a7 924(c)(1)(C). Moreover, when a defendant is convicted \nof violating section 924(c), the statute\u2019s mandatory \nminimum sentence must run consecutively rather than \nconcurrently \u201cwith any other term of imprisonment.\u201d Id. \n\u00a7 924(c)(1)(D)(ii).  \nIn Deal v. United States, 508 U.S. 129 (1993), the \nCourt interpreted section 924(c)\u2019s \u201csecond or subse-\nquent\u201d language to apply to multiple 924(c) convictions \nobtained in a single criminal proceeding. See 508 U.S. at \n134 (rejecting the contention that that section \u201c924(c)(1) \nmust be read to impose the enhanced sentence only for an \noffense committed after a previous sentence has become \nfinal\u201d). In other words, according to the Court, a \ndefendant could commit an initial and \u201csubsequent\u201d \noffense as part of a single criminal transaction prosecuted \nin a single case. The Court thus rejected the notion that \nsection 924(c) was intended to punish only recidivists \nand held that a defendant with no prior criminal history \ncould receive enhanced, consecutive sentences for each \nsection 924(c) count charged. Ibid. \nGiven its lengthy minimum consecutive penalties, \nsection 924(c) threatened exceptionally \u201clong prison sen-\n\n5 \n \ntences for anyone who uses a firearm in connection with \ncertain other federal crimes.\u201d United States v. Davis, 588 \nU.S. 445, 448 (2019). The practice of \u201ccharging multiple \nviolations of section 924(c) within the same indictment\u201d \nbecame known as \u201cstacking.\u201d See U.S. Sentencing Com-\nmission, Mandatory Minimum Penalties for Firearm \nOffenses in the Federal Criminal Justice System 271 (Oct. \n2011) (hereinafter USSC Report). Because each count \nbeyond the first was subject to the enhanced 25-year \nminimum penalty, stacking often resulted in de facto life \nsentences for first-time section 924(c) offenders\u2014often \nseveral hundred years\u2019 imprisonment imposed all at once. \nAs one court noted, a first-time offender frequently would \nreceive a lighter sentence \u201cif he had committed murder\u201d \nrather than a series of nonviolent drug sales while carry-\ning a firearm. United States v. Holloway, 68 F. Supp. 3d \n310, 313 (E.D.N.Y. 2014). \nStacking was widely criticized as unjust. District \njudges\u2014those on the front lines of the federal criminal \njustice system\u2014objected to having to impose what they \nviewed as drastic and disproportionate sentences for first-\ntime (and often nonviolent) offenders. See, e.g., United \nStates v. Angelos, 345 F. Supp. 2d 1227, 1230-33 (D. Utah \n2004) (having to sentence the defendant, a \u201ctwenty-four-\nyear-old first offender who is a successful music execu-\ntive with two young children,\u201d to \u201cprison for the rest of \nhis life is unjust, cruel, and even irrational\u201d). \nCircuit judges likewise expressed great discomfort \nhaving to affirm \u201cirrational, inhumane, and absurd\u201d \nsentences that were \u201ca predictable by-product of the cruel \nand unjust mandatory minimum sentencing scheme \nadopted by Congress.\u201d United States v. Hungerford, 465 \nF.3d 1113, 1118 (9th Cir. 2006) (Reinhardt, J., con-\ncurring); see also, e.g., United States v. Hunter, 770 F.3d \n740, 746-747 (8th Cir. 2014) (Bright, J., concurring) \n(decrying the sentence imposed as \u201cout of this world\u201d and \n\n6 \n \n\u201cjoin[ing] in the litany of criticisms directed towards\u201d the \n\u201coverly harsh\u201d practice of sentence stacking). \nJudges and commentators observed that, beyond the \nundue harshness of mandatory minimum sentences, the \nlaw also produced wildly divergent sentencing outcomes \nbased on mere geography\u2014prosecutors in some jurisdic-\ntions used stacking as a matter of course, while others \nmore often avoided it. See In re Hernandez, 857 F.3d \n1162, 1169 (11th Cir. 2017) (Martin, J., concurring) \n(explaining that the defendant \u201cmight never have \nreceived this sentence if he had been sentenced in another \npart of the country\u201d). And prosecutors frequently used \nthe threat of stacked sentences to induce defendants to \naccept plea deals, thus forfeiting their Sixth Amendment \nright to a jury trial, adding constitutional insult to \nstatutory injury. See Human Rights Watch, An Offer You \nCan\u2019t Refuse: How US Federal Prosecutors Force Drug \nDefendants to Plead Guilty (2013). \nAmong those calling for reform was the Sentencing \nCommission itself. USSC Report 359-362. In a report to \nCongress, the Commission explained that \u201c[t]he \u2018stack-\ning\u2019 of mandatory minimum penalties for multiple viola-\ntions of section 924(c) results in excessively severe and \nunjust sentences in some cases.\u201d Id. at 359. In many of \nthose cases, \u201cthe offense did not involve any physical \nharm or threat of physical harm to a person.\u201d Ibid. The \nCommission noted that the Judicial Conference had, on \nmultiple occasions, urged Congress \u201cto amend the \n\u2018draconian\u2019 penalties established at section 924(c).\u201d Id. \nat 360-361 (quoting Mandatory Minimums and Unin-\ntended Consequences: Hearing on H.R. 2934, H.R. 834, \nand H.R. 1466 Before the Subcommittee on Crime, \nTerrorism, and Homeland Security of the House Commit-\ntee on the Judiciary, 111th Cong. 35 (2009)); see also \nHearing Before the Over-Criminalization Task Force of \n2014 of the House Committee on the Judiciary, 113th \n\n7 \n \nCong. 23 (2014) (testimony of Hon.

Although it took several attempts over nearly a \ndecade, Congress finally heeded the Sentencing Commis-\nsion\u2019s call to action in 2018. Late that year, it enacted and \nPresident Trump signed the First Step Act, which was the \n\u201cproduct of a remarkable bipartisan effort.\u201d United States \nv. Henry, 983 F.3d 214, 218 (6th Cir. 2020). The \nculmination of work by an \u201cextraordinary political coali-\ntion\u201d (164 Cong. Rec. S7645 (daily ed. Dec. 17, 2018) \n(statement of Sen. Durbin)), the FSA made \u201conce-in-a-\ngeneration reforms to America\u2019s prison and sentencing \nsystem\u201d (Senate Passes Landmark Criminal Justice \nReform, U.S. Senate Committee on the Judiciary (Dec. \n18, 2018)). \nSection 403 of the FSA addresses sentence stacking. \nIts well-recognized purpose is \u201cto remedy past over-\nzealous use of mandatory-minimum sentences\u201d under \nsection 924(c). Henry, 983 F.3d at 218. To that end, \nsection 403(a) amends section 924(c) to clarify that the \n25-year mandatory minimum sentence applies only for \nviolations \u201coccur[ing] after a prior\u201d section 924(c) \nconviction \u201chas become final,\u201d effectively overruling \nDeal. See Oversight Hearing on the Federal Bureau of \nPrisons and Implementation of the First Step Act: Hearing \nBefore the Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, and Home-\nland Security of the House Committee on the Judiciary, \n116th Cong. 2 (2019) (statement of Rep. Karen Bass) \n(describing section 403 as \u201celiminat[ing] the ability to \nstack firearm enhancements within the same indictment, \nwhich has historically resulted in excessive sentences\u201d).  \nWithout stacked 25-year sentences, first-time offen-\nders convicted of multiple violations of section 924(c) at \nonce will receive consecutive five-year minimum sen-\ntences, rather than one five-year sentence and one or more \n25-year sentences.  \n\n8 \n \n3. By default, a change in sentencing law is prospec-\ntive only. That is so by statute\u20141 U.S.C. \u00a7 109 specifies \nthat a \u201cnew criminal statute [that amends or repeals] an \nolder criminal statute shall not change the penalties \n\u2018incurred\u2019 under that older statute \u2018unless the repealing \nAct shall so expressly provide.\u2019\u201d Dorsey v. United States, \n567 U.S. 260, 272 (2012) (quoting 1 U.S.C. \u00a7 109). For \nthis purpose, \u201cpenalties are \u2018incurred\u2019 under the older \nstatute when an offender * * * commits the underlying \nconduct that makes the offender liable.\u201d Ibid. \nBut by late 2018, Congress knew well how wide-\nspread and problematic sentence stacking had become. \nLawmakers thus added section 403(b) to the FSA. It \nspecifies that section 403(a)\u2019s amendment of section \n924(c) shall apply not only to future offenders, but also to \npast offenders whose criminal cases remain pending: \nApplicability to Pending Cases.\u2014This sec-\ntion, and the amendments made by this section, \nshall apply to any offense that was committed \nbefore the date of enactment of this Act, if a \nsentence for the offense has not been imposed as \nof such date of enactment. \nCongress thus extended section 403(a) relief to all crim-\ninal defendants whose sentence \u201chas not been imposed as \nof\u201d December 21, 2018.1  \nIn contrast, Congress did not make section 403(a) a \nbasis for reducing the sentence of a defendant whose case \nwas and remains subject to a final criminal judgment. \nInstead, it provided limited alternative relief through \n \n1  Section 401, which reduces mandatory minimum sentences for \nvarious federal drug offenses, uses identical language. Because \nsections 403(b) and 401(c) use the same language, the lower courts \n\u201chave construed them to have the same meaning.\u201d United States v. \nBethea, 841 F. App\u2019x 544, 548 n.5 (4th Cir. 2021); accord United \nStates v. Mitchell, 38 F.4th 382, 389 (3d Cir. 2022). \n\n9 \n \nsection 404 to \u201cdefendants previously sentenced\u201d in a \nfinal judgment, which this Court addressed three Terms \nago in Concepcion v. United States, 597 U.S. 481 (2022). \nUnder certain circumstances, section 404 authorizes \nsentence-reduction motions, which are a more limited \nform of sentencing relief than plenary resentencing \nfollowing a vacatur. See Dillon v. United States, 560 U.S. \n817, 830 (2010).  \nB. Factual and procedural background \n1. Petitioner Tony Hewitt and his co-defendants \nwere convicted on various charges relating to a series of \nbank robberies in 2008. The district court originally \nsentenced Hewitt to 355 years of imprisonment, the bulk \nof which corresponded to a number of stacked section \n924(c) counts. United States v. Duffey, 456 F. App\u2019x 434, \n438-439 (5th Cir. 2012); Judgment, No. 3:08-cv-167, \nDkt. 374 (N.D. Tex. May 7, 2010). The Fifth Circuit \nreversed the convictions in part and vacated Hewitt\u2019s \nsentence due to an error not relevant here. Duffey, 456 F. \nApp\u2019x at 444. On remand, the district court resentenced \nHewitt to 305 years\u2014275 years of which corresponded to \nmandatory 25-year consecutive sentences for second or \nsubsequent 924(c) convictions. The Fifth Circuit af-\nfirmed. United States v. Ross, 582 F. App\u2019x 528, 530 (5th \nCir. 2014); Amended Judgment, No. 3:08-cv-167, Dkt. \n524 (N.D. Tex. Dec. 6, 2012).  \nIn 2019\u2014after the FSA\u2019s enactment\u2014this Court \nheld that section 924(c)\u2019s \u201cresidual clause\u201d is uncon-\nstitutionally vague. Davis, 588 U.S. at 448. Following \nDavis, conspiracy-based charges no longer support \nconvictions under section 924(c). Given that several of \nHewitt\u2019s convictions were predicated on conspiracy to \ncommit bank robbery, Hewitt moved the Fifth Circuit for \nauthorization to file a successive section 2255 habeas \npetition. Pet. App. 3a. The Fifth Circuit granted leave. \n\n10 \n \nIbid. The district court, in turn, vacated the conspiracy-\nbased section 924(c) convictions, vacated the sentence on \nthe \nremaining \nconvictions, \nand \nordered \nplenary \nresentencing. Ibid.  \n2. The case returned to the district court for de novo \nresentencing, but the new presentence report prepared in \nHewitt\u2019s case did not account for section 403(a)\u2019s inter-\nvening amendment of section 924(c). Pet. App. 3a-4a. \nHewitt thus objected to the report, arguing that section \n403(a) should apply. Ibid. The difference, he observed, \nwas substantial: Under the law in place at the time of his \noriginal sentencing, his minimum sentence for the re-\nmaining section 924(c) counts would be 105 years, still \neffectively a life sentence. Under section 403(a) of the \nFSA, the combined mandatory minimum is 25 years.  \nHewitt\u2019s co-defendants raised the same objections. \nAs to them, the government took the position that section \n403 was inapplicable on resentencing because the initial \nsentence for each had been imposed before the FSA\u2019s date \nof enactment. But by the time of Hewitt\u2019s resentencing, \nthe government had reversed its course and requested \napplication of section 403(a) at Hewitt\u2019s resentencing. \nSee Sentencing Tr., No. 3:08-cv-167, Dkt. 785 at 19:8-16 \n(N.D. Tex. Jan. 17, 2023). \nThe district court rejected Hewitt\u2019s and the \ngovernment\u2019s position. Id. at 22:18-23:5. The court \nreasoned that even when a sentence has been vacated, \n\u201cit\u2019s not vacated for purposes of the statute.\u201d Id. at \n22:25-23:1. It thus held that section 403(a) does not \napply and sentenced Hewitt to a 165-year term of im-\nprisonment, 105 of which corresponded to stacked \nsection 924(c) sentences. Pet. App. 5a; see Judgment on \nResentencing, No. 3:08-cv-167, Dkt. 780 (N.D. Tex. Nov. \n8, 2022).  \n\n11 \n \n3. The Fifth Circuit affirmed. See Pet. App. 1a-16a. \nBefore the court of appeals, Hewitt and the government \nagain both argued that section 403(a) should apply at \nresentencing following the judicial vacatur of a pre-FSA \nsentence. Pet. App. 7a. The Fifth Circuit nonetheless con-\ncluded that section 403(b) bars relief for Hewitt and his \ncodefendants. Pet. App. 6a. \nWhile the Fifth Circuit acknowledged that the phrase \n\u201chas not been imposed\u201d is an example of \u201cpresent-perfect \ntense,\u201d the court focused predominantly on the word \n\u201cimposed.\u201d Pet. App. 7a. It reasoned that whether a \nsentence has been imposed \u201cappears to hinge on a district \ncourt\u2019s action or inaction\u201d as a singular point in time, and \n\u201cnot on a defendant\u2019s status.\u201d Pet. App. 8a. It thus held \nthat section 403(b)\u2019s focus is on the one-time historical \nfact of a sentence\u2019s imposition. Ibid. Because Hewitt had \nbeen sentenced before the FSA\u2019s enactment as a matter of \nhistorical fact, it held relief under section 403(a) was \nunavailable. Ibid. \nThe court reasoned that \u201c[i]f Congress meant for the \nFirst Step Act\u2019s retroactivity bar to apply only to valid \nsentences, it could easily have said so.\u201d Pet. App. 8a. And \nit rejected Hewitt\u2019s arguments to the contrary, explaining \nthat \u201c[t]he mere observation that the statutory language \ncould be made clearer does not make it unclear in the first \nplace.\u201d Id. at 9a (quoting United States v. Jackson, 995 \nF.3d 522, 526 (6th Cir. 2021)). \nThe Fifth Circuit held further that \u201cvacatur has no \neffect\u201d on the outcome of the case. Pet. App. 9a. That \nconclusion was justified, the court explained, because \n\u201cotherwise, one who, as here, has been in prison for over \na decade serving later-vacated sentences would nonethe-\nless qualify\u201d for a more lenient sentence at resentencing \nunder the FSA. Pet. App. 9a-10a. The court referred to 18 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 3742(g), which requires use of the guidelines \n\u201cthat were in effect on the date of the previous sentencing \n\n12 \n \nof the defendant prior to the appeal\u201d for resentencing, \nwhich it characterized as giving continuing effect to \ninitial sentences that have been vacated. Id. at 10a. On \nthose grounds, the court affirmed. \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nPursuant to section 403(b) of the FSA, section 403(a) \napplies to a defendant who committed an offense and was \nconvicted and sentenced pre-enactment, but whose initial \nconviction and sentence have been vacated, necessitating \na post-enactment de novo resentencing.  \nA.1. The question here is whether Congress meant \u201ca \nsentence for the offense\u201d to include a sentence that was \npronounced before that date but later vacated. It could not \nhave done so. Congress drafts and enacts statutes against \nbackground legal principles, the content of which is \npresumptively incorporated into the meaning of the words \nit uses. As relevant here, the law treats a sentence that has \nbeen vacated as a nullity ab initio, as if it never existed. \nCases from before the Founding and consistently through \ntoday confirm that when an order or judgment is vacated, \nthe status quo ante is restored, and it is as though the order \nor judgment had never been made.  \nCongress is presumed to have known that settled \nlegal principle and, absent a contrary indication, to have \nincorporated it in the FSA. A sentence that has been \nvacated therefore cannot be \u201ca sentence for the offense,\u201d \nbecause a sentence that has been vacated does not exist. \nIt therefore cannot be ground to deny substantive relief at \nresentencing. \n2. Some lower courts have reasoned that to focus on \nthe invalidation ab initio of a vacated judgment is to add \nwords to section 403(b), effectively inserting the word \n\u201cvalid\u201d in front of the word \u201csentence.\u201d That reading has \nmatters backward. Again, the Court must presume that \nCongress incorporates settled legal principles into the \n\n13 \n \nstatutes it enacts. It therefore does not add words to the \nstatute to presume the word \u201csentence\u201d means a sentence \nthat has not been vacated. On the contrary, to read \u201ca \nsentence\u201d in section 403(b) to include a vacated sentence \nwould be to read it as \u201can initial sentence\u201d or \u201can original \nsentence.\u201d Such modifiers would be necessary to displace \nthe background rule that the law treats a sentence that \nhas been vacated as though it never existed. But Congress \ndid not include those words. \n3. Other courts have held that section 403(b) refers \nonly to the historical fact of a past pronouncement and \nthat a vacatur does not change the past. That is wrong \ntwice over. First, vacatur does change the past by opera-\ntion of law\u2014cases from time immemorial stand for the \nproposition that when an order is vacated, it as though the \nproceeding that produced the order never happened. That \nis why the Double Jeopardy Clause does not bar retrial \nafter a conviction is vacated on appeal. \nSecond, section 403(b) refers to the ongoing enforce-\nment of a sentence, not the fact of a past pronouncement. \nCongress\u2019s use of the present-perfect tense and the \npreposition \u201cas of\u201d confirm so. Use of the present-perfect \ntense implies concern with a time-span beginning in the \npast and extending up to now. And the preposition \u201cas of\u201d \nis used to indicate a time or date from which something \ncontinues. Together, they indicate that Congress was \nconcerned only with sentences that were pronounced pre-\nenactment and remain in force and effect today.  \nCommon English usage confirms the point. No one \nwould say that Hewitt\u2019s initial, since-vacated sentence \n\u201chas been imposed as of December 21, 2018,\u201d because it \nhas no continuing force or effect. If one wanted to refer to \nthe fact of a vacated sentence having been pronounced, \none would use the simple past tense and a preposition \nindicating a singular point in time: Hewitt\u2019s initial, since-\nvacated sentence was imposed before December 21, 2018. \n\n14 \n \nIndeed, Congress used just that formulation in section \n404, concerning sentencing modifications. That it did so \nthere but not in section 403(b) must be taken as inten-\ntional.  \n4. Statutory interpretation turns on ordinary, con-\ntemporary, and common use of the English language. \nThus, while rules of grammar and dictionary definitions \nare centrally important, the outcome cannot be \ndetermined by a single phrase scrutinized in the abstract. \nThe Court must look to the relevant language in its full \ncontext, with an eye to the statute\u2019s overall objective. \nOnly our interpretation is consistent with the FSA\u2019s \nbroader context, design, and purpose. Section 403(b) \nreflects a clear purpose: to make section 403(a)\u2019s amelior-\native sentencing reform available retroactively in pending \ncases while preserving the finality of valid criminal \njudgments. That line is sensible. Allowing application in \npending cases ensures that no court ever again engages in \nsentencing stacking, while at the same time respecting \nthe importance of the principle of finality to criminal \njustice and sound judicial administration. \nPlenary resentencings following full vacaturs are \n\u201cpending\u201d cases like any other; there is no sentence for \nthe defendant to serve, and a new one must be imposed by \nexercise of de novo judicial discretion. In that context, \napplication of section 403(a) would do nothing to disturb \nthe finality of an already-vacated judgment. Applying \nsection 403(a) to such cases is thus consistent with \nCongress\u2019s objective to foreclose stacking in pending \ncases while preserving the finality of past cases. \nThe opposite is true of the decision below. It draws an \narbitrary line between plenary sentencings and plenary \nresentencings, without any account for why Congress \nwould have intended such an irrational distinction. And \nin doing so, it ensures that prosecutors still may seek, and \n\n15 \n \ncourts still will be required to impose, stacked sentences \nin plenary sentencing proceedings into the future. That \ncannot be what Congress intended. \nB. The rule of lenity arises only if the Court concludes \nthat the statutory text is ambiguous, which the provision \nhere is not. But if the Court disagrees, it must resolve the \nambiguity in favor of Hewitt and the lesser sentence \nrequired under section 403(a). \nThe Court has repeatedly confirmed that the rule of \nlenity applies not only to statutes that define criminal \nliability, but also those that set the penalties for \nviolations. Under our interpretation of section 403(a), \nHewitt would face a mandatory minimum of 25 years. \nUnder the Fifth, Sixth, and Eleventh Circuit\u2019s mistaken \nconstruction, he would face a mandatory minimum of \nlonger than one century at his resentencing on the section \n924(c) counts alone. If there is any reasonable doubt \nabout the construction of section 403(a), it must be \nresolved in his favor. \nARGUMENT \n\u201cThe controlling principle in this case is the basic and \nunexceptional rule that courts must give effect to the \nclear meaning of statutes as written.\u201d Star Athletica, LLC \nv. Varsity Brands, Inc., 580 U.S. 405, 414 (2017) \n(quoting Estate of Coward v. Nicklos Drilling Co., 505 \nU.S. 469, 476 (1992)). When the statute\u2019s text is \u201cunam-\nbiguous,\u201d that \u201cfirst step of the interpretive inquiry\u201d is \nalso the \u201clast.\u201d Rotkiske v. Klemm, 589 U.S. 8, 13 (2019). \nTo interpret Congress\u2019s words, the Court must focus \non \u201cordinary, contemporary, [and] common\u201d use of the \nEnglish language. Star Athletica, 580 U.S. at 414. That \nmeans among other things the Court must give the text a \nreading that is consistent with and incorporates settled \nbackground legal principles, with which the public would \nexpect any words to comport. E.g., Cannon v. University \n\n16 \n \nof Chicago, 441 U.S. 677, 696-697 (1979) (explaining \nthat \u201c[i]t is always appropriate to assume that our elected \nrepresentatives, like other citizens, know the law\u201d). \nAnd while background principles, rules of grammar, \nand dictionary definitions are centrally important to the \ntask of statutory interpretation, the Court must \u201c\u2018con-\nsider not only the bare meaning\u2019 of the critical word or \nphrase \u2018but also its placement and purpose in the statu-\ntory scheme.\u2019\u201d Holloway v. United States, 526 U.S. 1, 6 \n(1999) (quoting Bailey v. United States, 516 U.S. 137, 145 \n(1995)). The only permissible meaning of a word or \nphrase is the one that fits with the statutory context and \npurpose, rather than conflicts with them. See, e.g., Dubin \nv. United States, 599 U.S. 110, 118-120 (2023). \nFirst, Congress did not intend the phrase \u201ca sentence \nfor the offense\u201d to include a vacated sentence. According \nto settled background principles, the law treats a vacated \nsentence as never having been pronounced. For a statute \nto override that principle requires a clear statement. \nThere is no such statement here.  \nSecond, the contrary rationales offered among the \nlower courts are unpersuasive. The rules of grammar, \nrelevant dictionary definitions, and statutory context all \nconfirm that Congress intended section 403(b) to \nauthorize section 403(a) relief in all pending cases, \nincluding cases that are pending de novo resentencing \nfollowing a vacatur. No other conclusion is consistent \nwith Congress\u2019s purpose or settled practice. And even if \nthere were doubt on that front (there should be none), it \nwould be resolved by the rule of lenity.  \nNo matter whether the Court finds the words clear or \nambiguous, a resentencing with the benefit of section \n403(a) is necessary. \n\n17 \n \nA. Section 403(a) applies to post-enactment \nde novo resentencings \nAll relevant considerations\u2014the text, context, and \npurpose of the FSA, the statute\u2019s design, and the back-\nground principles against which it was enacted\u2014confirm \nthat section 403(a) applies to plenary resentencings that \ntake place after the Act\u2019s enactment. \n1. A sentence that has been vacated is not \u201ca \nsentence for the offense\u201d \nThe central issue is whether Congress meant \u201ca \nsentence for the offense\u201d imposed \u201cas of\u201d December 21, \n2018, to include a sentence that was pronounced before \nthat date but later vacated. It did not. \na. One rule for reading \u201cstatutory text is recognizing \nthat Congress legislates against the backdrop of certain \nunexpressed presumptions.\u201d Bond v. United States, 572 \nU.S. 844, 857 (2014). Among those presumptions is that \n\u201cCongress is aware of existing law\u201d and, absent express \nindication otherwise, intends for the statutes it enacts to \ncomport with settled background legal principles and \nprecedents. See, e.g., Mississippi ex rel. Hood v. AU \nOptronics Corp., 571 U.S. 161, 169 (2014); accord \nCannon, 441 U.S. at 696-697. \nPut another way, the background principles against \nwhich Congress acts operate as default rules to which it \npresumptively intends for its enactments to conform. \nBecause the accepted legal backdrop will generally accord \nwith \u201cwidely held intuitions about how statutes ordin-\narily operate,\u201d a presumption that Congress means to \nincorporate background legal principles \u201cwill generally \ncoincide with legislative and public expectations.\u201d \nLandgraf v. USI Film Productions, 511 U.S. 244, 272 \n(1994). Cf. US Airways, Inc. v. McCutchen, 569 U.S. 88, \n102 (2013) (in a case concerning ERISA plan documents, \nrelying on the \u201cdefault rules [that] govern in the absence \n\n18 \n \nof a clear expression of [a] contrary intent\u201d); Staub v. \nProctor Hospital, 562 U.S. 411, 418 (2011) (in a federal \ntort case, observing that the Court must \u201cconsult general \nprinciples of law\u201d that \u201cform the background against \nwhich federal tort laws are enacted\u201d). \nb. Here, the settled legal background against which \nsection 403(b) was adopted demonstrates beyond debate \nthat Congress did not mean for \u201ca sentence\u201d to include a \nvacated sentence. Absent contrary intent, a vacated order \nis and always has been treated as though it was never \nentered in the first place\u2014it is a nullity, as though it never \nexisted. See United States v. Mitchell, 38 F.4th 382, 392 \n(3d Cir. 2022) (Bibas, J., concurring) (historical prin-\nciples \u201creveal that vacatur makes a sentence void from \nthe start\u201d). Nothing in section 403(b)\u2019s text overrides \nthat default understanding. \nTake first historical sources. At common law before \nthe Founding, vacatur on appeal made it \u201cas if no \n[judgment] had been\u201d entered, meaning in effect that \nthere was no \u201crecord of it.\u201d Ognell\u2019s Case (1592) 78 Eng. \nRep. 526, 526; 34 Cro. Eliz. 270, 271 (Q.B.); accord Eyre \nv. Woodfine (1592) 78 Eng. Rep. 533, 533; 34 Cro. Eliz. \n278, 278-279 (Q.B.). Countless other historical sources \nconfirm that when an order is vacated, it is \u201cin all respects \nas though the [order] had never been made.\u201d Norman v. \nNorman, 207 P. 970, 972 (Okla. 1922). Since time out of \nmind, courts have understood that vacatur \u201cputs the \nparties in the state, in which they were, immediately \nbefore the judgment was rendered,\u201d fully restoring the \nstatus quo ante. Lockwood v. Jones, 7 Conn. 431, 436 \n(1829). This Court summarized this principle more than \n150 years ago: \u201cvacating the former judgment * * * \nrender[s] it null and void, and the parties are left in the \nsame situation as if no trial had ever taken place in the \ncause.\u201d United States v. Ayres, 76 U.S. (9 Wall.) 608, 610 \n(1869).  \n\n19 \n \nA vacated order is not merely \u201csuspended\u201d on a \nforward-looking basis, while \u201cretain[ing] its vitality\u201d \nretrospectively. Stewart v. Oneal, 237 F. 897, 906 (6th \nCir. 1916). Rather, \u201cwhere an irregular order has been \nvacated it is held to be the same as though it never existed, \nand for that reason\u201d courts may not afford any \u201cprotec-\ntion to the acts which may have been performed under it.\u201d \nFarnsworth v. Western Union Telephone Co., 6 N.Y.S. \n735, 747 (Gen. Term 1889) (emphasis added). When \norders are vacated, it is \u201cas though they had never been \nmade or had\u201d in the first place. United States v. Mayse, 5 \nF.2d 885, 886 (9th Cir. 1925).2 \nThis ancient principle has been carried forward to \nmodern times without meaningful alteration. Like their \nforebears, cases since the midcentury onward confirm \nthat after a conviction is vacated, the defendant \u201cstand[s] \n \n2  Other historical examples expressing this principle are too many to \nlist. For a limited sample, see Williams v. Floyd, 27 N.C. 649, 656 \n(1845) (a void or \u201cstricken\u201d order is \u201cthe same as if the [order] had \nnever been made\u201d); Lawson v. Bissell, 7 Ohio St. 129, 132 (1857) \n(when a verdict and judgment are \u201cvacated\u201d it is \u201cas if there had been \nno trial\u201d); In re Lacey, 14 F. Cas. 906, 908 (C.C.D. Conn. 1874) \n(vacating an order allows the parties to act \u201cin the same way and \nmanner, and to the like effect\u201d as they could have had the order \n\u201cnever been made\u201d); Strickland v. Flagstaff Silver Mining Co., 1 Utah \n199, 204 (1875) (for purposes of post-judgment motions, a judgment \nthat is vacated \u201cwas as though it had never existed\u201d); Aultman v. \nSeiberling, 31 Ohio St. 201, 204 (1877) (when a decision is vacated, \nthe law and the facts are treated \u201cthe same as if no decision had been \nmade\u201d); Bondholders & Purchasers of the Iron Railroad v. Toledo, 62 \nF. 166, 168 (7th Cir. 1894) (after a court order vacating and annulling \na decree disallowing a claim, the claim was \u201cre-established in all \nrespects as fully as if [the vacated decree] had never been made\u201d); \nGreen v. McCarter, 42 S.E. 157, 158 (S.C. 1902) (when a judge \n\u201crevoke[s] his * * * order, the case [stands] just as if no order had been \nmade\u201d); In re Rochester Sanitarium & Baths Co., 222 F. 22, 26 (2d \nCir. 1915) (recognizing \u201c[t]he general rule\u201d that when a court vacates \nan order, \u201cit is the same as if such order had never existed\u201d). \n\n20 \n \nin the position of any man who was accused of a crime but \nhas not yet shown to have committed it.\u201d Fiswick v. \nUnited States, 329 U.S. 211, 223 (1946). \u201cThe general \nrule,\u201d according to these cases, \u201cis that when an order or \njudgment is vacated the previously existing status is \nrestored and the situation is the same as though the order \nor judgment had never been made.\u201d Wrang v. Spencer, \n235 A.2d 861, 863 (Conn. App. Ct. 1967). Nearly \nverbatim restatements of this universal principle appear \nin Mitchell v. Joseph, 117 F.2d 253, 255 (7th Cir. 1941); \nMiller v. Schlereth, 36 N.W.2d 497, 506 (Neb. 1949); \nTims v. Holland Furnace Co., 90 N.E.2d 376, 380 (Ohio \n1950); and Buchanan v. Cabiness, 245 S.W.2d 868, 873 \n(Mo. 1951) (en banc). \nThe notion that a vacated order is treated as though it \nhad never been entered in the first place reflects the same \nprinciple behind the Court\u2019s own Munsingwear doctrine: \nAn order vacating a judgment \u201celiminates [the] judg-\nment\u201d so that \u201cnone is prejudiced\u201d by it, \u201cclear[ing] the \npath for future relitigation of the issues between the \nparties.\u201d United States v. Munsingwear, 340 U.S. 36, 40 \n(1950). \u201cThe point of vacatur is to prevent\u201d its object \n\u201cfrom spawning any legal consequences, so that no party \nis harmed by\u201d it. Camreta v. Greene, 563 U.S. 692, 713 \n(2011) (citing Munsingwear). \nAnd the law not only treats the vacated judgment as \na nullity in its own right, but also regards the proceedings \nproducing it effectively as never having happened. Thus, \nfor example, the vacatur of a criminal judgment of convic-\ntion on appeal effectively erases from history the fact of \nthe jury\u2019s empanelment in the original trial, and thus in \nmost circumstances \u201cthere is no double jeopardy upon a \nnew trial.\u201d Burks v. United States, 437 U.S. 1, 12 (1978) \n(quoting Bryan v. United States, 338 U.S. 552, 560 \n(1950)). That rule \u201crests ultimately upon the premise that \nthe original conviction has, at the defendant\u2019s behest, \n\n21 \n \nbeen wholly nullified and the slate wiped clean.\u201d North \nCarolina v. Pearce, 395 U.S. 711, 721 (1969) (citing \nUnited States v. Ball, 163 U.S. 662 (1896)). \nThe same rationale applies with respect to senten-\ncing. As the Court made clear in Pepper v. United States, \n562 U.S. 476 (2011), when a court of appeals \u201cset[s] \naside [a defendant\u2019s] entire sentence and remand[s] for a \nde novo resentencing,\u201d all legal effect from the original \nsentencing proceeding is nullified, \u201ceffectively wip[ing] \nthe slate clean.\u201d Id. at 507. Rulings made at the original \nsentencing therefore have no continuing vitality under \nthe law-of-the-case doctrine. Ibid. \nc. The legal backdrop against which Congress en-\nacted the FSA is thus clear: When a criminal sentence is \nvacated, the status quo ante is restored as if the sentence \nhad never been pronounced. A sentence that has been \nvacated is a nullity; it is nothing; it never existed. See \nFiswick, 329 U.S. at 223.  \nThat resolves this case. Congress specified that \nsection 403(a)\u2019s sentencing reform shall apply \u201cif a \nsentence for the offense has not been imposed as of\u201d \nDecember 21, 2018. FSA \u00a7 403(b) (emphasis added). \nBecause a sentence that has been vacated is treated by \noperation of law as though it never was imposed\u2014so that \nit \u201cspawn[s no] legal consequences\u201d and \u201cno party is \nharmed by\u201d it (Camreta, 563 U.S. at 713 (quoting \nMunsingwear, 340 U.S. at 40-41))\u2014Congress could not \nhave intended for \u201ca sentence\u201d to include a vacated \nsentence. As a matter of law, an offender whose sentence \nhas been vacated is one for whom \u201ca sentence for the \noffense has not been imposed\u201d ever, including as of \nDecember 21, 2018.  \n\n22 \n \n2. Contrary opinions among the lower courts \nare not persuasive \na. In holding otherwise, the Fifth Circuit focused on \nthe indefinite article, \u201ca\u201d appearing before the word \n\u201csentence.\u201d See Pet. App. 8a-9a. The same argument was \nspelled out by then-Judge Barrett in her dissent in United \nStates v. Uriarte, 975 F.3d 596 (7th Cir. 2020) (en banc): \n\u201c[T]he indefinite article \u2018a\u2019 is broad enough,\u201d she argued, \n\u201cto refer to any sentence that has been imposed for the \noffense, even one that was subsequently vacated.\u201d Id. at \n608. In her and the Fifth Circuit\u2019s view, a pre-enactment \nsentence, even if later vacated, remains \u201ca sentence\u201d \nimposed \u201cas of\u201d December 21, 2018. Ibid.; Pet. App. 8a-\n9a; see also United States v. Hernandez, 107 F.4th 965, \n969 (11th Cir. 2024). \nRespectfully, that position disregards the nature of a \nvacatur and the default rule that it establishes. When \nCongress says \u201ca sentence\u201d without more, it cannot mean \na sentence that is treated by operation of law as never \nhaving been imposed. Otherwise, what would it mean for \nsomething to be treated as never having been imposed? \nThat conclusion does not add words to the statute, as \nthe Fifth Circuit implied. In the lower court\u2019s view, \u201c[i]f \nCongress meant for the First Step Act\u2019s retroactivity bar \nto apply only to valid sentences, it could easily have said \nso\u201d by specifying \u201ca valid sentence.\u201d Pet. App. 8a-9a. But \nthat misses the point, which is that an adjective like \n\u201cvalid\u201d would have been redundant given the background \nlegal principles against which Congress adopted the FSA. \nAgain, Congress is presumed to be aware of and \nincorporate those principles in the statues it enacts. And \nhere, the long-settled rule is that when an unlawful \u201corder \nhas been vacated it is held to be the same as though it \nnever existed\u201d and the law will \u201cafford no protection to \n\n23 \n \nthe acts which may have been performed under it.\u201d \nFarnsworth, 6 N.Y.S. at 747.  \nAccordingly, it is the Fifth Circuit\u2019s reading, not \npetitioner\u2019s, that would add words to the statute. To read \n\u201ca sentence\u201d as including a vacated sentence would be to \nread the statute as saying \u201can initial sentence\u201d or \u201can \noriginal sentence.\u201d Use of such adjectives would have \nreadily displaced the default rule that a vacated sentence \nis treated as a matter of law as never having existed. But \nCongress did not use those modifiers, and thus the \nassumption \u201cthat our elected representatives, like other \ncitizens, know the law\u201d when they draft and enact \nstatutes (Cannon, 441 U.S. at 696-697) carries the day \nfor Hewitt. \nb. Some lower courts have instead simply denied the \npremise of the argument, asserting that an order fully \nvacating a sentence \u201cdoes not require the district court to \nproceed as if the initial sentencing never happened.\u201d Pet. \nApp. 9a (quoting Uriarte, 975 F.3d at 608 (Barrett, J., \ndissenting)). For support, they have pointed to 18 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 3742(g)(1), which specifies that \u201ca district court \nimposing a sentence on remand\u201d following a vacatur on \nappeal \u201cmust apply the Sentencing Guidelines \u2018that were \nin effect on the date of the previous sentencing of the defen-\ndant prior to the appeal.\u2019\u201d Uriarte, 975 F.3d at 608 \n(Barrett, J., dissenting) (quoting section 3742(g)(1)). \nThat, we are told, is evidence that the effects of a vacated \nsentence are not wholly eliminated, and a court need not \n\u201cproceed as if the earlier sentencing never happened.\u201d \nUnited States v. Carpenter, 80 F.4th 790, 792 (6th Cir. \n2023) (Kethledge, J., concurring in the denial of rehear-\ning en banc). \nThat misunderstands what section 3742(g)(1) does. \nAs a starting point, the very relevance of the provision is \ndoubtful. It provides only that when a court of appeals \nremands a case for resentencing (plenary or otherwise), \n\n24 \n \nthe district court must utilize the sentencing guidelines \n\u201cthat were in effect on the date of the previous sen-\ntencing.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(g)(1). That shows only that \nCongress did not want changes to the guidelines to apply \nretroactively at resentencing. The statute\u2019s reference to \nthe state of the law on \u201cthe date of\u201d a prior proceeding \ndoes not suggest in any way that a vacated sentence itself \ncontinues to have legal force or effect.  \nMoreover, to the extent section 3742(g) has any rele-\nvance, it is only to confirm that Congress knows how to \nuse express language to override the default rule when it \nwishes to. Our point is not that a vacated sentence can \nnever have ongoing consequences\u2014it is only that, given \nthat Congress is assumed to understand that a vacated \nsentence is treated as if it were never entered, Congress \nwould have to use express language to accomplish that \nobjective. That is at most what section 3742(g) confirms: \nWhen Congress wants a vacated sentence to continue to \nhave some effect, it says so using a clear statement. Such \nlanguage is missing from section 403(b). \n3. Section 403(b) refers to the ongoing enforce-\nment of a sentence, not the fact of a past pro-\nnouncement \na. Other lower court opinions have rejected the rele-\nvance of vacatur by characterizing the imposition of a \nsentence as a historical fact that, if it occurred, cannot be \nerased from the documented past by a later vacatur of the \nsentence. According to this rationale, when Congress said \nthat section 403(a) shall apply to a pre-enactment offense \n\u201cif a sentence for the offense has not been imposed as of\u201d \nDecember 21, 2018 (FSA \u00a7 403(b)), it actually meant \u201cif \na sentence was not pronounced before\u201d that date.  \nThe Eleventh Circuit took this view in Hernandez. \nThere, it reasoned that section 403(b) \u201cis best read to \nrefer to a completed act\u201d because it conjugates the verb \n\n25 \n \n\u201cimposed,\u201d which \u201crefers to the historical fact of pro-\nnouncement\u201d taking place at \u201ca specific point in time.\u201d \nHernandez, 107 F.4th at 969-970; accord Pet. App. 7a-\n8a. Viewing the imposition of a sentence this way renders \neffect of vacatur irrelevant, according to these sources, \nbecause \u201cvacatur does not erase * * * from history\u201d the \nrecorded fact that a sentence was pronounced on a date \npreceding enactment. United States v. Jackson, 995 F.3d \n522, 525 (6th Cir. 2021). \nb. The problem with that approach is two-fold.  \nFirst, that is indeed precisely what an order of vacatur \ndoes\u2014by operation of law, it erases from history both the \nvacated order or judgment and the proceeding that \nproduced it. Thus, when a verdict and judgment are \n\u201cvacate[d],\u201d it is \u201cas if no trial had ever taken place in the \ncause.\u201d Ayres, 76 U.S. (9 Wall.) at 610; accord Lawson, \n7 Ohio St. at 132 (following a vacatur, the case must \nproceed \u201cas if there had been no trial\u201d).  \nAgain, that is the premise underlying the rule that \n\u201cthere is no double jeopardy upon a new trial\u201d following \na vacatur on appeal of the final judgment. Burks, 437 U.S. \nat 12. \u201cThere are few if any rules of criminal procedure \nclearer than the rule that \u2018jeopardy attaches when the jury \nis empaneled and sworn.\u2019\u201d Martinez v. Illinois, 572 U.S. \n833, 839 (2014) (quoting Crist v. Bretz, 437 U.S. 28, 35 \n(1978)). But when a conviction is later vacated, the law \ntreats the jury\u2019s empanelment at the first trial effectively \nas if it had never happened. Burks, 437 U.S. at 12.  \nApplied here, that means that no legal disability may \nfollow from Hewitt\u2019s sentence ever having existed, \nincluding any disability following from the historical fact \nof the pronouncement having taken place. \nSecond, the historical-fact approach to section 403(b) \nis inconsistent with the verb tense and preposition that \nCongress used there. If Congress had meant the applic-\n\n26 \n \nability of section 403(a) to turn on whether a district \njudge had pronounced a sentence on a date preceding \nDecember 21, 2018, as a simple matter of historical fact, \nit would not have used the present-perfect tense or the \npreposition \u201cas of.\u201d Instead, it would have used the \nsimple past tense, together with a preposition such as \nbefore or prior to\u2014it would have said section 403(a) shall \napply to a pre-enactment offense \u201cif a sentence for the \noffense was imposed before such date of enactment.\u201d That \nword choice would have been consistent with the House \nLegislative Drafting Manual, which directs drafters of \nlegislation to use the past tense to refer to \u201cfacts that \nmust precede\u201d the statute\u2019s \u201coperation.\u201d House Legisla-\ntive Counsel\u2019s Manual on Drafting Style, HLC No. 104-1, \n\u00a7 351(f)(2), at 60 (1995). \nBut that is not the formulation that Congress chose. \nInstead, it used the present-perfect tense, together with \nthe preposition \u201cas of.\u201d Each alone\u2014and undeniably both \ntogether\u2014connote an ongoing condition rather than the \noccurrence of a singular past event.  \nThe relevant grammar rules make this clear. The \npresent-perfect tense uses the words \u201chas been\u201d (or in \nthis case \u201chas not been\u201d). Whereas the past tense \u201cis a \nsimple tense, just past,\u201d the present perfect \u201cis a com-\npound tense combining past and present.\u201d Rodney Hud-\ndleston & Geoffrey K. Pullum, The Cambridge Grammar \nof the English Language 142 (2002) (hereinafter \nCambridge Grammar). That is to say, the present perfect \n\u201cinvolves reference to both past and present time\u201d and \n\u201cis concerned with a time-span beginning in the past and \nextending up to now.\u201d Id. at 143 (emphasis added). Thus, \nin contrast with the past tense, which focuses on a \nsingular past occurrence, \u201cthe primary focus\u201d of the \npresent-perfect \u201cis on the present.\u201d Ibid. It accordingly \n\u201cis not used in contexts where the \u2018now\u2019 component of \n[the time span] is explicitly or implicitly excluded,\u201d such \n\n27 \n \nas when one is speaking about a discrete past event that \nhas concluded. Ibid. \nThat alone forecloses Hernandez\u2019s past-historical-\nfact rationale. If one says that a sentence \u201chas been im-\nposed as of\u201d some past date, it indicates that the sentence \nwas in effect on that date and is still being enforced today, \n\u201cextending up to now.\u201d Cambridge Grammar 143. It \nindicates, in other words, that the sentence remains final \nand in force at the time of speaking, and that it has not \nbeen vacated by a court. 3 \nThat conclusion follows not only from the use of the \npresent-perfect tense, but also from the preposition \u201cas \nof,\u201d which indicates a time or date \u201cfrom\u201d which some-\nthing begins or continues. See Collins English Dictionary \n113 (14th ed. 2023) (hereinafter Collins). One would say, \nfor example, that a contract is effective \u201cas of\u201d the date it \ncomes into force. In doing so, one would indicate the \ncommencement of a continuous period of enforcement\u2014\nthe effective date and onward. And if one were to combine \n\u201cas of\u201d with the present-perfect tense (stating that a \ncontract \u201chas been effective as of December 21, 2018\u201d), \nthe plain meaning would be that the contract was en-\nforceable on that date and remains so now. In contrast, it \nwould be incoherent to say that a contract \u201chas been \neffective as of December 21, 2018,\u201d if, at the time of \nspeaking, the contract was terminated by the parties or \nvoided by a court.3 \n \n3  It bears noting \u201cthe widely accepted modern legislative drafting \nconvention that a law should not be read to speak as of the date of \nenactment,\u201d but \u201c\u2018as of any date on which it is read.\u2019\u201d Carr v. United \nStates, 560 U.S. 438, 463 (2010) (Alito, J., dissenting) (quoting \nSenate Office of the Legislative Counsel, Legislative Drafting \nManual \u00a7 103(a), at 4 (1997)). This convention recognizes that most \nlaws \u201chave a continuing effect in that they apply over time,\u201d and they \nthus \u201cspeak at the time of reading, not merely at the time of their \nadoption.\u201d Id. at 464.  \n\n28 \n \nThe same goes for section 403(b). Congress specified \nthat section 403(a) shall apply to a pre-enactment offense \n\u201cif a sentence for the offense has not been imposed as of\u201d \nDecember 21, 2018. The inverse is that section 403(a) \nshall not apply to a pre-enactment offense \u201cif a sentence \nfor the offense has been imposed as of\u201d that date. But it \nwould be ungrammatical to say that Hewitt is a defendant \non whom \u201ca sentence has been imposed as of\u201d December \n21, 2018, because that formulation mistakenly implies \nthat at the time of speaking, there is a present, ongoing \nenforcement of his sentence. \nOne might say that Hewitt\u2019s initial sentence was \nimposed before that date. But, again, those are not the \nwords Congress used. And \u201ccourts must presume that a \nlegislature says in a statute what it means and means in a \nstatute what it says there.\u201d Connecticut National Bank v. \nGermain, 503 U.S. 249, 253-254 (1992). \nc. Use of the word \u201cimposed\u201d does not change mat-\nters. To be sure, \u201cimposed,\u201d viewed in isolation, can be \ntaken to mean \u201cto establish as something to be obeyed or \ncomplied with.\u201d Collins 984; see also Webster\u2019s Third \nNew International Dictionary 1136 (2002) (hereinafter \nWebster\u2019s) (defining impose as, among other things, \n\u201cbestow\u201d). On that meaning, a judge who imposes a \nsentence establishes it or bestows it on the defendant as a \nmatter of fact at a singular point in time.  \nBut the word can also mean to \u201cenforce\u201d (Collins \n984) or to \u201capply,\u201d as in a \u201cpenalty\u201d (Webster\u2019s 1136). \nUnderstood in that way, the word means an ongoing \ncondition of enforcement: A sentence is imposed on (it is \napplied to or enforced against) an offender during the \nentire duration of his or her incarceration. This meaning \nsuggests not a singular past occurrence that took place at \na particular point in time, but rather an ongoing condition: \nA \u201csentence remains \u2018imposed\u2019\u201d until it is \u201cvacate[d].\u201d \n\n29 \n \nUnited States v. Henry, 983 F.3d 214, 223 (6th Cir. \n2020). \nThe academic possibility of these two meanings does \nnot render section 403(b) ambiguous. The proper interp-\nretation of \u201cwords that can have more than one meaning\u201d \nare generally resolved \u201cby their surroundings.\u201d Arizona \nv. Inter Tribal Council of Arizona, 570 U.S. 1, 10 (2013) \n(quoting Whitman v. American Trucking Associations, \n531 U.S. 457, 466 (2001)). That is, the \u201csusceptibility\u201d \nof a singular word to multiple meanings does not neces-\nsarily render the word ambiguous, because \u201call but one of \nthe meanings is ordinarily eliminated by context.\u201d Deal v. \nUnited States, 508 U.S. 129, 131-132 (1993). \nJust so here. By using the present-perfect tense \n(rather than the past tense) and the preposition \u201cas of\u201d \n(rather than \u201cbefore\u201d or \u201cprior to\u201d) Congress signaled its \nfocus on a \u201ctime-span beginning in the past and extending \nup to now.\u201d Cambridge Grammar 143. Any contention \nthat the word \u201cimposed\u201d in section 403(b) \u201crefers to the \nhistorical fact of pronouncement\u201d at \u201ca specific point in \ntime\u201d (Hernandez, 107 F.4th at 970) rather than a \ncondition of ongoing enforcement would require reform-\ning the tense and replacing the preposition that Congress \nused. The law permits no such revisions. \nd. Moreover, section 404 of the FSA demonstrates \nthat Congress was aware of and intended the difference. \nThere, Congress provided for motions to reduce valid, \nfinal sentences in limited circumstances. See generally \nConcepcion v. United States, 597 U.S. 481 (2022). In \ndoing so, Congress limited relief in two notable ways. \nFirst, it specified in section 404(c) that \u201c[n]o court shall \nentertain a motion made under this section to reduce a \nsentence if the sentence was previously imposed or \npreviously reduced\u201d under certain circumstances. FSA \n\u00a7 404(c), Pet. App. 21a. If the lower court were correct \nthat Congress intended in section 403(b) to refer to a \n\n30 \n \nsingular past event (the pronouncement of a sentence \nbefore enactment), it presumably would have used the \nsame formulation\u2014section 403(a) shall apply to pre-\nenactment offenses \u201cif no sentence for the offense was \npreviously imposed.\u201d It did not do so. \n Second, also in section 404(c), Congress foreclosed \nrelief if a motion \u201cto reduce the sentence was, after the \ndate of enactment of this Act, denied after a complete \nreview of the motion on the merits.\u201d Again, if the lower \ncourt\u2019s reading were correct, Congress could have used \nthat alternative formulation in section 403(b)\u2014section \n403(a) shall apply to pre-enactment offenses \u201cif no \nsentence for the offense was imposed before said date of \nenactment.\u201d Again, it did not do so. \nBoth examples demonstrate that Congress knows \nhow to use the simple past tense to denote discrete events \ntaking place at fixed times in the past when it wishes to. \nIt did so in section 404(c), but it did not do so in section \n403(b). And the Court \u201cgenerally presum[es] that Con-\ngress acts intentionally and purposely when it includes \nparticular language in one section of a statute but omits it \nin another.\u201d Intel Corp. Investment Policy Committee v. \nSulyma, 589 U.S. 178, 186 (2020) (quoting BFP v. Res-\nolution Trust Corporation, 511 U.S. 531, 537 (1994)).  \nAll of this leads to a straightforward conclusion: \nWhen Congress said that section 403(a) shall apply to a \npre-enactment offense \u201cif a sentence for the offense has \nnot been imposed as of\u201d December 21, 2018 (FSA \n\u00a7 403(b), Pet. App. 20a), it meant a sentence that was \nbeing enforced \u201cas of\u201d that date and is still being enforced \nat the relevant time of reading. And needless to say, that \ndoes not describe a sentence vacated before the reading.  \n\n31 \n \n4. Purpose and practice confirm that section \n403(a) applies to plenary resentencings \na. Purpose and practice confirm the Fifth Circuit\u2019s \nerror in this case. Statutory interpretation turns on the \nway that ordinary English speakers use language. The \nCourt thus has a long history of reading statutory words \nand phrases \u201cnot in a vacuum, but with reference to the \nstatutory context, \u2018structure, history, and purpose,\u2019\u201d \n\u201cnot to mention common sense.\u201d Abramski v. United \nStates, 573 U.S. 169, 179 (2014) (quoting Maracich v. \nSpears, 570 U.S. 48, 76 (2013)). While rules of grammar, \ndictionary definitions, and background legal principles \nare of course matters of central importance, the Court \n\u201cmust not be guided by a single sentence or member of a \nsentence\u201d studied in the academic abstract; it must \ninstead \u201clook to the provisions of the whole law, and to \nits object and policy.\u201d Kelly v. Robinson, 479 U.S. 36, 43 \n(1986) (quoting Offshore Logistics, Inc. v. Tallentire, 477 \nU.S. 207, 221 (1986)).  \nAlthough broader in total effect, the FSA\u2019s \u201cmost \nimportant reforms\u201d were the \u201cchanges to mandatory \nminimums\u201d at issue here. 164 Cong. Rec. S7748 (daily \ned. Dec. 18, 2018) (statement of Sen. Klobuchar). Moved \nby heartless examples of excessive imprisonment, Con-\ngress set out to \u201celiminate[] the so-called stacking pro-\nvision in the U.S. Code\u201d and to \u201censure that sentencing \nenhancements for repeat offenses apply only to true \nrepeat offenders.\u201d Id. at S7774 (statement of Sen. \nCardin); accord 164 Cong. Rec. H10362 (daily ed. Dec. \n20, 2018) (statement of Rep. Nadler). Courts on both \nsides of the issue have thus concluded that the FSA\u2019s \npurpose \u201cis obvious: to reduce the harsh length of sen-\ntences for * * * certain firearms offenses.\u201d Mitchell, 38 \nF.4th at 387. It was, in other words, \u201cto ensure that the \nlengthy mandatory-minimum sentences for stacked \n\n32 \n \n\u00a7 924(c) convictions ended, whether at initial senten-\ncings or resentencings.\u201d Henry, 983 F.3d at 224.  \nTo that end, Congress made section 403(a) applicable \nnot only to post-enactment crimes, but also pre-enact-\nment ones. In doing so, it had two options: First, it could \nmake section 403(a) retroactively applicable to all \ndefendants serving stacked sentences, including those \nsubject to valid final judgments. Second, it could make \nsection 403(a) retroactively applicable to crimes com-\nmitted pre-enactment, but only in pending, non-final \ncases.  \nThe choice required a balance of competing values of \nthe highest order. On the one hand, Congress was deeply \nconcerned that defendants were serving unduly harsh and \noverlong sentences. Few government interventions have \nthe same impact and gravity as deprivation of liberty by \nimprisonment. On the other hand, there is a \u201cstrong \ninterest in preserving the finality of judgments.\u201d Harris \nv. Rivera, 454 U.S. 339, 348 n.21 (1981) (quoting Hen-\nderson v. Kibbe, 431 U.S. 145, 154 n.13 (1977)). \nLegislators understand that \u201c[f]inality is essential to both \nthe retributive and the deterrent functions of criminal \nlaw.\u201d Calderon v. Thompson, 523 U.S. 538, 555 (1998). \nAnd finality serves the public\u2019s interest in efficient \njudicial administration, increases confidence in the \njustice system, and fosters the public interest in repose. \nEvidently with these latter principles in mind, Con-\ngress selected the second option: It made section 403(a) \nrelief available to defendants whose criminal conduct \npredated enactment of the statute, but whose cases were \n\u201cpending\u201d (that is, those whose sentence \u201chas not been \n\n33 \n \nimposed as of\u201d the FSA\u2019s enactment). See FSA \u00a7 403(b) \n(titled \u201cApplicability to Pending Cases\u201d).4 \nIn taking this approach, \u201cCongress stanched, to the \ndegree that it could,\u201d the problem of sentence stacking, \nbut \u201cwithout overturning valid and settled sentences.\u201d \nUriarte, 975 F.3d at 601. \u201cIn choosing not to write \n\u00a7 403(b) to allow reductions to valid sentences that al-\nready had been imposed, Congress expressed a policy \npreference in favor of settled expectations and ease of \nadministration.\u201d Id. at 605; see also United States v. \nMerrell, 37 F.4th 571, 576 (9th Cir. 2022) (\u201c[W]e find it \nclear that \u00a7 403(b) was intended to ensure that the \nadoption of the First Step Act by itself would not affect \nany sentence previously imposed.\u201d); Henry, 983 F.3d at \n225 (\u201cCongress chose not to disrupt the finality of past \nsentences \n* * * \nfor \ndefendants \nserving \nstacked \nsentences.\u201d).  \nWhat is more, Congress \u201cnaturally wanted to reach \nall cases where there was not already a sentence in place.\u201d \nUriarte, 975 F.3d at 605. It intended to give defendants \nthe benefit of section 403(a) at all future plenary \nsentencing proceedings, without disturbing the sentences \nvalidly imposed in past proceedings. \nb. Applying section 403(a) to defendants like Hewitt \nis consistent with Congress\u2019s policy choice. The lower \ncourt\u2019s contrary decision is not. \nOnce a court vacates a criminal sentence and orders a \nde novo resentencing, there can no longer be any interest \n \n4  \u201cThis Court has long considered that the title of a statute and the \nheading of a section are tools available for the resolution of a doubt \nabout the meaning of\u201d a statutory provision. Dubin, 599 U.S. at 120-\n121 (cleaned up). A section title cannot \u201coverride\u201d the words that \nfollow, but Congress\u2019s words \u201cmust be construed in light of the terms \nsurrounding them, and the title Congress chose is among those \nterms.\u201d Id. at 121 (cleaned up).  \n\n34 \n \nin finality. See Pepper, 562 U.S. at 507. Because the \ndistrict court must resentence the defendant \u201cas if no \ninitial sentencing ever occurred\u201d (United States v. Burke, \n863 F.3d 1355, 1359 (11th Cir. 2017)), finality is already \nout the window by the time the district court undertakes \na de novo resentencing following a vacatur. The initial \nsentence is gone, and a brand new sentence must be deter-\nmined and pronounced. \nPractice bears this out. A plenary resentencing is a de \nnovo proceeding, and the district court must exercise its \ndiscretion anew in setting an appropriate sentence. \u201c[A]t \nany subsequent resentencing after a sentence has been set \naside,\u201d the court must determine a sentence \u201cbased on \nappropriate consideration of all of the factors listed in \n\u00a7 3553(a),\u201d without regard for prior rulings from the \ninitial sentencing. Pepper, 562 U.S. at 490. Among other \nthings, the probation officer must prepare a new \npresentence report (see Pet. App. 3a-4a; Dkt. 785, at 15), \nthe parties must submit new objections and responses \n(Dkts. 694, 699), and the court must hold a new hearing \nand consider and resolve the disagreements. See Concep-\ncion, 597 U.S. at 484.  \nThere is no conceivable reason that Congress would \nhave wanted district courts to continue imposing \u201cirra-\ntional, inhumane, and absurd\u201d sentences pursuant to a \n\u201ccruel and unjust\u201d sentencing rule (Hungerford, 465 \nF.3d at 1118 (Reinhardt, J., concurring)) that it had just \nrepealed retroactively for all pending cases. On the \ncontrary, lawmakers \u201cwanted the unfair practice\u201d of \nstacking \u201cstopped upon enactment\u201d (Uriarte, 975 F.3d at \n603) because they \u201crecognized that such lengthy sen-\ntences * * * were draconian and sought to end the \npractice\u201d (Henry, 983 F.3d at 225).  \nNo court and no party in any case presenting this \nissue has identified any reason why Congress would have \nintended for courts to continue to impose since-repu-\n\n35 \n \ndiated stacking rules in plenary resentencings. Simply \nput, there is none. Given \u201cthat Congress had determined \nthat the earlier sentencing structure resulted in sentences \nthat were too long and unfair,\u201d its goal was to \u201censur[e] \nthat those sentences would not be imposed on defendants \nyet to be sentenced,\u201d for whatever reason. Uriarte, 975 \nF.3d at 603. The Court is not required to turn a blind eye \nto that purpose, adopting an interpretation that does \nviolence to it rather than respecting it. \nB. Any ambiguity must be resolved in favor of \napplying section 403(a) to Hewitt \nIf, after all, there were any doubt about section \n403(b)\u2019s proper interpretation, the rule of lenity would \nrequire the Court to resolve it in Hewitt\u2019s favor. A penal \nstatute cannot be construed to impose a 105-year \nmandatory minimum sentence when another plausible \nreading would produce a 25-year mandatory minimum. \nNo matter the Court\u2019s view of the interpretations adopted \nby the Fifth, Sixth, and Eleventh Circuits, Hewitt\u2019s inter-\npretation is at the very least a plausible one. The rule of \nlenity thus requires the Court to adopt it.  \n1. The rule of lenity is an interpretive canon \u201cnot \nmuch less old than [statutory] construction itself.\u201d \nUnited States v. Wiltberger, 18 U.S. (5 Wheat.) 76, 95 \n(1820) (Marshall, C.J.). It demands that \u201cambiguity \nconcerning the ambit of criminal statutes should be \nresolved in favor of lenity.\u201d Skilling v. United States, 561 \nU.S. 358, 410 (2010) (quoting Cleveland v. United States, \n531 U.S. 12, 25 (2000)). It \u201capplies not only to \ninterpretations of the substantive ambit of criminal \nprohibitions, but also to the penalties they impose.\u201d \nBifulco v. United States, 447 U.S. 381, 387 (1980). \nSimply stated, \u201c[i]n the construction of a penal statute, it \nis well settled *\u202f*\u202f* that all reasonable doubts concerning \n\n36 \n \nits meaning ought to operate in favor of [the defendant].\u201d \nHarrison v. Vose, 50 U.S. (9 How.) 372, 378 (1850).  \nThe rule is grounded in the Constitution. It ensures \n\u201cthat the power of punishment is vested in the legislative, \nnot in the judicial department,\u201d for it is \u201cthe legislature, \nnot the Court, which is to define a crime, and ordain its \npunishment.\u201d Wiltberger, 18 U.S. (5 Wheat.) at 95; see \nalso Wooden v. United States, 595 U.S. 360, 388-392 \n(2022) (Gorsuch, J., concurring) (describing the due-\nprocess and separation-of-powers underpinnings).  \nThe rule of lenity applies when the ordinary tools of \nconstruction (\u201ctext, structure, and history\u201d) \u201cfail to \nestablish that\u201d the harsher reading is \u201cunambiguously \ncorrect.\u201d United States v. Granderson, 511 U.S. 39, 54 \n(1994). Lenity applies \u201cwhen, after consulting traditional \ncanons of statutory construction, [the Court is] left with \nan ambiguous statute.\u201d Shular v. United States, 589 U.S. \n154, 165 (2020) (quoting United States v. Shabani, 513 \nU.S. 10, 17 (1994)); see also Wooden, 595 U.S. at 392-\n393 (Gorsuch, J., concurring).  \n2. As we demonstrated in the preceding parts of this \nbrief, section 403(b) states plainly that Hewitt\u2019s plenary \nresentencing shall be subject to section 403(a). That is \nthe only reading consistent with the background rules \nagainst which Congress enacted the FSA, as well as the \nrelevant rules of grammar, the definitions of the terms \nused, the structure and scheme of the statute, and \nCongress\u2019s manifest purpose. \nIf for any reason the Court concludes that the lower \ncourt\u2019s alternative interpretation is a possible one, the \nrule of lenity would dictate that the ambiguity be resolved \nin Hewitt\u2019s favor. Indeed, this is a textbook case for \napplication of lenity. Defendants like Hewitt who are \nresentenced will receive drastically lower sentences \nunder our interpretation than they would under the Fifth, \n\n37 \n \nSixth, and Eleventh Circuits\u2019 construction. \u201c[L]enity \nmeans that the Court will not interpret a federal criminal \nstatute so as to increase the penalty that it places on an \nindividual when such an interpretation can be based on no \nmore than a guess as to what Congress intended.\u201d Bifulco, \n447 U.S. at 387 (quoting Ladner v. United States, 358 \nU.S. 169, 178 (1958)). To adopt the Fifth, Sixth, and \nEleventh Circuit\u2019s reading would mean making just such \na guess.  \nIf, after applying all the textual rules of construction, \nthe Court sees no one clear answer, then lenity requires \nreversal. Granderson proves the point. There, as here, the \nCourt addressed a question of statutory interpretation \nconcerning sentencing. 511 U.S. at 41. The practical \ndifference between the principal options was a mandatory \n20-month sentence (if the government was correct) or a \nmandatory two-month sentence (if the defendant was \ncorrect). Id. at 41-42. After evaluating the \u201ctext, \nstructure, and history\u201d and finding no clear answer, the \nCourt \u201cappl[ied] the rule of lenity and resolve[d] the \nambiguity in [the defendant\u2019s] favor.\u201d Id. at 54.  \nThe same process is required here. There is no \nquestion that Hewitt must be resentenced. Under our \ninterpretation of section 403(a), he would face a \nmandatory minimum of 25 years. Under the Fifth, Sixth, \nand Eleventh Circuits\u2019 construction, he would face a \nmandatory minimum of longer than 100 years at his \nresentencing. Were there any \u201creasonable doubt\u201d about \nthe construction of section 403(a), that doubt \u201cshould be \nresolved in favor of\u201d Hewitt. Wooden, 595 U.S. at 397 \n(Gorsuch, J., concurring). \n \n \n\n38 \n \nCONCLUSION \nThe Court should reverse and remand with instruc-\ntions to resentence Hewitt under section 403(a). \nRespectfully submitted. \nEugene R.

          "task_beliefs": "My initial belief state was one of complete uncertainty regarding the legal facts, precedents, and arguments in *Hewitt v. United States*. Based on the initial analysis, my understanding has been structured. I now know that the central legal question is whether \u00a7 403 of the First Step Act of 2018, which eliminated sentence \"stacking\" for certain firearm offenses, applies to a defendant who was sentenced *before* the Act but resentenced *after* it took effect.\n\nWhile I still lack specific evidence, I have identified the key parameters necessary to build a predictive model for this case:\n1.  **Statutory Text:** The precise wording of \u00a7 403 of the First Step Act is a critical unknown. The outcome will likely hinge on whether the text explicitly addresses its application to resentencing proceedings or contains temporal language that guides its application.\n2.  **Lower Court Reasoning:** The Fifth Circuit's rationale for denying the application of \u00a7 403 is a key piece of the puzzle. Understanding their legal interpretation is necessary to evaluate the petitioner's counterarguments.\n3.  **Petitioner's Arguments:** The core arguments for reversal that will be presented to the Supreme Court are the primary drivers of the case.\n4.  **Government's Position:** A highly salient fact is that the U.S. government, after initially opposing the petitioner, has changed its position to support them. The reasoning behind this \"confession of error\" is a strong potential signal about the government's view of the law's correct interpretation and could significantly influence the Court.\n5.  **Relevant Precedent:** The body of case law governing statutory retroactivity in the criminal sentencing context will form the legal backdrop for the Court's decision.\n\nMy uncertainty about the final outcome remains high, but it is no longer undifferentiated. It is now focused on these specific, researchable questions.",
          "design_beliefs": "My initial belief state was one of complete uncertainty about effective strategies for predicting Supreme Court outcomes. My first internal reasoning cycle has established a set of foundational hypotheses and strategies for this class of problem.\n\nMy methodological understanding has evolved to include the following principles:\n1.  **Problem Decomposition:** A crucial first step is to break down a complex legal prediction task into two distinct sets of questions: task-specific legal questions (\u03b8) and generalizable predictive patterns (D). This structures the inquiry and separates case-specific knowledge from meta-level strategic knowledge.\n2.  **Primary Source Prioritization:** For reducing task-level (\u03b8) uncertainty, the most direct and reliable strategy is to start with the primary source documents of the case itself. Specifically, the briefs filed by the petitioner and respondent are the most direct source for understanding the arguments the Court will consider.\n3.  **Identify High-Value Signals:** Certain signals carry disproportionate weight in SCOTUS prediction. The position of the Solicitor General is one such signal. A change in the government's position (a \"confession of error\") is a particularly noteworthy event that suggests a strong legal argument for the side the government has joined. This is a powerful heuristic that should be prioritized in the analysis.\n4.  **Contextualize with Judicial Behavior:** A complete prediction requires more than just the legal arguments. It's important to investigate broader patterns, such as how the Court generally handles statutory interpretation in a specific area (like sentencing reform) and whether established judicial philosophies (e.g., textualism, purposivism) or known voting blocs are likely to influence the outcome. This forms the basis of a robust design-level (D) analysis."

My primary uncertainty (\u03b8) has now shifted from understanding the petitioner's case to understanding the counterarguments that persuaded the Fifth Circuit and that the Supreme Court will need to grapple with. The petitioner's brief mentions that the government (the respondent) has switched positions and now agrees with the petitioner. This is a critical piece of information and a very strong signal. However, when the government confesses error like this, the Supreme Court often appoints an amicus curiae to defend the judgment of the lower court, ensuring a robust adversarial presentation. To build a complete model of the case, my next step must be to find the arguments against the petitioner. The most direct source for these arguments will be the brief filed by the court-appointed amicus. If there is no such amicus, the next best source would be the respondent's (U.S. government's) brief, which, while supporting the petitioner, will likely have to explain and rebut the lower court's reasoning. Therefore, I will first search for a brief from a court-appointed amicus. If that fails, I will search for the respondent's brief.",

        "current_beliefs": {
          "task_beliefs": "My belief state has been significantly updated by analyzing the petitioner's merits brief. My initial understanding was structured around five key unknowns; this observation has provided substantial clarity on several of them.\n\nMy knowledge of the case has evolved from a general understanding of the legal question to a detailed map of the petitioner's specific arguments. I now know that the petitioner's case rests on several interconnected pillars:\n1.  **Textual Argument (The \"Nullity\" Principle):** The core of the petitioner's argument is that a sentence, once vacated, is a legal \"nullity\" \u2014 it is *void ab initio* and treated as if it never happened. Therefore, when \u00a7 403(b) of the First Step Act refers to a case where \"a sentence for the offense has not been imposed as of such date of enactment,\" it logically includes Hewitt's situation. At the time of his post-FSA resentencing, there was no legally valid sentence in place. The brief cites a long history of case law, including *North Carolina v. Pearce*, to support the principle that a vacated judgment has no ongoing legal effect.\n2.  **Grammatical Argument (Tense and Preposition):** The petitioner argues that the use of the present-perfect tense (\"has been imposed\") in conjunction with the preposition \"as of\" signifies a state that must be true and continue to be true at the time of evaluation. Since Hewitt's sentence was vacated, it can no longer be said that a sentence \"has been imposed\" in a legally meaningful way. The brief emphasizes that an ordinary English speaker would not describe a voided sentence as still being \"imposed.\"\n3.  **Purposive Argument (Congressional Intent):** The brief heavily emphasizes that the clear and \"remarkable bipartisan\" purpose of \u00a7 403 was to eliminate the \"unjust,\" \"irrational,\" and \"draconian\" practice of sentence stacking established by *Deal v. United States*. Forcing a court to reimpose a stacked sentence during a *de novo* resentencing proceeding would directly contradict this manifest congressional intent.\n4.  **Structural Argument (Finality):** The petitioner preemptively refutes the counterargument based on finality. They argue that the need to respect final judgments is irrelevant here because Hewitt's sentence was vacated for reasons entirely independent of the First Step Act (due to the *United States v. Davis* decision). Once vacated, the case reverted to a pre-final, \"pending\" status, making the new sentencing a *de novo* proceeding where the court should apply the law as it currently exists. The brief cites *Pepper v. United States* to support the breadth of a court's authority in a *de novo* resentencing.\n5.  **Rule of Lenity:** As a fallback position, the petitioner argues that if any ambiguity remains in the statutory text, the rule of lenity requires the court to interpret it in favor of the defendant. The brief cites *United States v. Granderson* and *Wooden v. United States* in support of this canon.\n\nMy uncertainty is now much more focused. It has shifted from \"what will the petitioner argue?\" to \"how strong are the counterarguments that persuaded the Fifth, Sixth, and Eleventh Circuits?\" The petitioner's case appears robust, appealing to textual, structural, and purposive reasoning, and is bolstered by the government's \"confession of error.\" My prediction now leans more strongly in favor of the petitioner, pending analysis of the opposing view.",
          "design_beliefs": "My methodological framework for predicting Supreme Court outcomes has been tested and refined by this observation.\n\nMy core principles have been validated and deepened:\n1.  **Problem Decomposition:** This remains a foundational strategy. The petitioner's brief itself is a masterclass in this, breaking its argument into textual, structural, purposive, and canonical components. This confirms that mirroring this argumentative structure is an effective way to model a legal case.\n2.  **Primary Source Prioritization:** This belief is now strongly confirmed. The action of retrieving and analyzing the petitioner's brief was exceptionally high-yield, directly answering several of the task-level (\u03b8) questions I had previously identified as critical. It provided a comprehensive roadmap of the legal arguments, key precedents, and statutory interpretation from one side's perspective.\n3.  **Identify High-Value Signals:** My initial hypothesis that the Solicitor General's position is a powerful signal is reinforced. The petitioner's brief explicitly leverages the government's change of position (\"As the government now agrees...\"), demonstrating that the parties themselves view it as a significant factor for the Court's consideration.\n4.  **Contextualize with Judicial Behavior:** This principle remains important. The petitioner's arguments are tailored to appeal to different judicial philosophies. The textual and grammatical arguments appeal to textualists, while the purposive arguments appeal to those who weigh legislative intent more heavily. A successful prediction will involve assessing which of these arguments is likely to resonate most with the current composition of the Court.\n\nBased on this observation, I have developed new, more specific heuristics:\n*   **Argumentative Synergy:** The most persuasive legal positions often weave together multiple, mutually reinforcing lines of reasoning (e.g., text, purpose, precedent). When evaluating a case, I should not just count the arguments but assess how they form a coherent and synergistic whole. The petitioner's brief is a strong example of this.\n*   **The \"Legal Nullity\" Heuristic:** The concept of a prior action (like a sentence or judgment) being rendered a \"nullity\" by *vacatur* is a powerful and recurring legal principle. In future cases involving vacated orders, I should immediately recognize this as a potentially decisive line of argument.\n*   **Strategic Information Sequencing:** The most efficient path of inquiry is to first secure the primary briefs (petitioner, respondent, and key amici like the Solicitor General). This provides the complete universe of arguments the Court will be considering and is the most direct way to reduce uncertainty about the core legal questions. My next action should be to acquire the brief arguing the opposing side to create a balanced model."

L. No. 115-391, \n132 Stat. 5194 (\u201cFSA\u201d), was a landmark, bipartisan \nreform to the federal criminal justice system. Its \nsentencing amendments\u2014Sections 401 and 403\u2014\nplayed a critical role in the law\u2019s passage. The \nquestion presented is whether Section 403\u2019s sentence \nreductions for firearm offenses apply to defendants \nwhose pre-enactment sentences are vacated and who \nare then resentenced post-enactment.  But resolving \nthis question will also decide how Section 401 should \nbe read. Section 401 modified sentence enhancements \nfor drug offenses\u2014the largest category of federal \ncrimes. These Section 401 reforms sought to reign in \na system of disproportionate, arbitrary punishments. \nUnder the old system, a difference of twelve years in \nprison could hinge on inconsistently applied, racially \ndisparate prosecutorial discretion that varied widely \nfrom district to district. This Court has already \ninterpreted portions of the First Step Act several \ntimes, and the provisions at issue here are equally \npressing. By granting certiorari in this case, the Court \nwill \nresolve \nthe \nnow-entrenched \ncircuit \nsplit \nundermining Congress\u2019 reforms. As a result, this \nCourt can transform the lives of those facing the \ndraconian sentences that Sections 401 and 403 sought \nto change. \n \n \n \n \n \n\n3 \n \n \nARGUMENT  \nI. Congress \npassed \noverdue, \nbipartisan \nsentencing reform in the First Step Act, \nimpacting tens of thousands of lives. \n1. The First Step Act is a sweeping criminal justice \nreform law, remarkable in its breadth and depth of \nsupport. Congress voted to pass the Act in 2018 by \noverwhelming margins: 87\u201312 in the Senate and 358\u2013\n36 in the House of Representatives. 164 Cong. Rec. \nS7,781 (daily ed. Dec. 18, 2018); 164 Cong. Rec. \nH10,430 (daily ed. Dec. 20, 2018). At its signing, \nPresident Donald J. Trump hailed the Act as \u201can \nincredible moment\u201d for criminal justice reform, and \nnoted the law\u2019s \u201cunheard of\u201d level of bipartisan \nsupport.2 The Act included three major parts: (1) \nsentencing reform through changes to the penalties \nfor some federal crimes; (2) correctional reform \nthrough creation of a Bureau of Prisons (BOP) risk \nand needs assessment system; and (3) reauthorization \nof the Second Chance Act of 2007.3  \n2. The FSA addressed the increasingly obvious \nflaws in federal sentencing. \u201cInflexible mandatory \nminimum sentences\u201d for nonviolent offenders had \ntriggered \u201can explosion in our Federal prisons,\u201d while \nfailing to \u201cdeter drug use or drug crime.\u201d 164 Cong. \nRec.

This Court and the courts of appeals have \nconfirmed that the Act\u2019s interpretation warrants \nattention. This very term in Pulsifer v.

Uriarte, \n975 F.3d 596, 605 (7th Cir. 2020). And this Court has \nalready considered a handful of cases involving the \nAct in the five years since its passage. See, e.g., \nPulsifer, slip. op.; Concepcion v. United States, 142 S. \nCt. 2389 (2022); Terry v. United States, 141 S. Ct. 1858 \n(2021). Construing the Act\u2019s language clearly merits \nthe Court\u2019s time\u2014particularly in the face of a \nhardened circuit conflict like this. \nII. Taking up the question presented allows this \nCourt to also interpret Section 401(c)\u2019s \nsentence reforms for drug offenses. \n  The petition presents the question of whether \nSection 403 applies to vacated sentences. Petitioner \nhas explained the importance of this provision, which \neliminates the practice of \u201cstacking\u201d firearm offenses. \nBut interpreting Section 403 also impacts those with \nvacated sentences under Section 401, which reformed \nsentence enhancements for drug offenders. United \nStates v. Bethea, 841 F. App\u2019x 544, 548 n.5 (4th Cir. \n2021) (Sections 401(c) and 403(b) construed to have \nsame meaning). Further, the Fifth Circuit has now \njoined the Sixth in a reading of these provisions that \nconflicts with the Ninth and the Third Circuits. See \nPet. 6\u20139.  Thus, the split has deepened since this \nCourt denied review of the same question presented \nin Carpenter v. United States (No. 23-531). Mr. \nHewitt\u2019s case presents the Court with the opportunity \n\n8 \n \n \nto both reconcile a circuit split and settle the meaning \nof two crucial provisions in the First Step Act\u2019s \nsentencing reforms.  \nA. Drug offenders represent the largest \ncategory of federal prisoners. \nMore federal inmates are in prison for drug \noffenses than any other category of crime. In fact, \ntwice as many individuals are in our federal prisons \nfor drug crimes (more than 44%) than for the next \nlargest \ncategory: \ncrimes \ninvolving \nweapons, \nexplosives, and arson (about 22%).10 Sixty-seven \npercent of drug offenders were convicted of an offense \ncarrying a mandatory minimum penalty and almost \nhalf of those individuals remained subject to that \npenalty at sentencing.11 On top of that mandatory \nminimum, an individual may face a sentence \nenhancement based on past offenses. A 2018 U.S. \nSentencing \nCommission \nstudy \nfound \nthat \napproximately one third of drug offenders qualified for \nsentence enhancements\u2014more than 6,000 people.12  \n \n10 Federal Bureau of Prisons, Offenses (Apr. 6, 2024), \nhttps://perma.cc/A7RR-39X7. \n11 U.S. Sentencing Comm\u2019n, Quick Facts on Mandatory \nMinimum Penalties 2 (2022), https://perma.cc/4SNE-25VP. \n12 U.S. Sentencing Comm\u2019n, Report-At-A-Glance: Federal Drug \nRecidivism Enhancements 1 (2018), https://perma.cc/XWG9-\n5JW8. \n\n9 \n \n \nB. Section 401 mitigated the frequency and \nseverity of sentence enhancements for \ndrug offenses, helping to remedy the \nharsh and arbitrary application of these \npenalties. \n1. Section 401 changed the mandatory-minimum \nsentencing enhancements under the Controlled \nSubstances Act, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 801 et seq., and the \nControlled Substances Import and Export Act, 21 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 951 et seq. Prosecutors may seek sentence \nenhancements \nbased \non \na \ndefendant\u2019s \nprior \nconvictions by following the proceedings described in \n21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851.13 Sentencing enhancements under \nboth \nlaws \nare \ntherefore \nknown \nas \n\u201c851 \nenhancements.\u201d14  \n2. Prior to the First Step Act, 851 enhancements \nforced judges to levy harsh penalties on drug \noffenders. The enhancement for a defendant with a \nsingle qualifying drug offense was a mandatory \nminimum of twenty years. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b) \n(amended 2018). If the defendant had two or more \nqualifying offenses, that mandatory minimum became \nlife. Id. Moreover, the old law set a low bar for what \nconstituted a qualifying drug offense\u2014any drug crime \npunishable by more than a year\u2019s imprisonment \nsufficed, including simple possession. See id. \u00a7 802(44) \n \n13 Section 962 of the Controlled Substances Act incorporates by \nreference the procedures stated in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851, making \nSection 851 the operative provision across both statutes. 21 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 962. \n14 See, e.g., U.S. Sentencing Comm\u2019n, Application and Impact of \nSection 851 Enhancements (July 2018), https://perma.cc/7NXA-\n4ZLP. \n\n10 \n \n \n(defining a \u201cfelony drug offense\u201d as one punishable by \nimprisonment for more than one year). This definition \nswept in defendants who were sentenced to less than \na year, released before a year was up, or were \nsentenced to probation alone. An individual who had \nbeen convicted of one prior felony drug offense twenty \nyears \nearlier \ncould \nget \nthe \nsame \nsentence \nenhancement as someone who had been found guilty \nof the same offense only one year ago. The system \ntreated all felony drug offenders identically. \nThese sentence enhancements were not only \ndraconian; they were also inconsistently applied.  A \n2011 study on mandatory minimum sentences found \nthat in most judicial districts, between one quarter \nand one half of all drug offenders qualified for a \nsentence enhancement; in a third of districts, the rate \nwas as high as 50% to 75%.15 The number of \ndefendants actually sentenced with enhancements \nwas lower, but worryingly, the Commission found \n\u201csignificant variation in the manner in which the \nenhancement provision was applied.\u201d 2011 Report, \nsupra, at 260. For example, in six districts more than \n75% of eligible defendants received the enhancement, \nbut in eight districts, no eligible offenders received it. \nId. at 260\u201361. Based on these findings, the \n \n15 U.S. Sentencing Comm\u2019n, 2011 Report to the Congress: \nMandatory Minimum Penalties in the Federal Criminal Justice \nSystem 260 (2011), https://perma.cc/DT3U-D3RR [hereinafter \n2011 Report]. \n\n11 \n \n \nCommission recommended that Congress \u201creassess \nthe severity and scope of 851 enhancements.\u201d16 \nIn early 2018, the Commission undertook a study \nwholly focused on 851 enhancements. The report \nfound that, although almost a third of drug offenders \nqualified for sentence enhancements, application of \nthe enhancements continued to vary wildly, \u201cranging \nfrom five districts in which an 851 enhancement was \nsought against more than 50% of eligible drug \ntrafficking offenders to nineteen districts in which the \nenhancement was not sought against any of the \neligible offenders.\u201d17 Further, the report unearthed \ntroubling racial disparities. Black offenders accounted \nfor 42% of those who qualified for sentence \nenhancements but made up a staggering 58% of those \nwho received enhancements. 2018 Report, supra, at \n34 tbl.5.  By contrast, 26% of white offenders were \neligible for enhancements, yet only 24% received \nthem. Id.  \nDefendants suffered major consequences if a court \nsentenced them under the enhanced sentencing \nregime. The Commission found that, if a prosecutor \nchose not to seek an enhanced sentence, offenders \notherwise eligible for the enhancement received an \naverage sentence of seven years. Id. at 7. By contrast, \nwhen the prosecutor did seek the enhancement, it \n \n16 U.S. Sentencing Comm\u2019n, Application and Impact of Section \n851 \nEnhancements: \nKey \nFindings \n(July \n2018), \nhttps://perma.cc/RL7S-BV84. \n17 U.S. Sentencing Comm\u2019n, Application and Impact of 21 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 851: Enhanced Penalties for Federal Drug Trafficking \nOffenders \n6 \n(July \n2018), \nhttps://perma.cc/AKH6-7WTS \n[hereinafter 2018 Report]. \n\n12 \n \n \nadded another twelve years to the sentence on \naverage, more than doubling the individual\u2019s time in \nprison. Id. In other words, similarly situated \ndefendants were receiving sentences that varied by \nmore than a decade\u2014seven years for some and \nnineteen years for others. The data depicted an \narbitrary system, where punishment turned not on \nthe actions of the defendant, but on the prosecutor and \ndistrict in which the defendant was sentenced.   \n3. Section 401 of the First Step Act sought to \nmitigate the severity of 851 enhancements in two \nways. First, the provision restricted which crimes \nqualified as predicates for most mandatory-minimum \nsentences. Only drug trafficking offenses for which \nthe defendant had served more than twelve months of \nimprisonment now qualified. First Step Act of 2018, \nPub. L. No. 115-391, \u00a7 401(a)(1), 132 Stat. 5194, 5221, \n21 U.S.C. \u00a7 802(57). Additionally, offenses that were \nmore than fifteen years old could no longer support an \nenhanced sentence. Id. Second, Section 401 reduced \nthe severity of sentence enhancements. For example, \nfor a defendant convicted under \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A) who \nhas a single prior qualifying offense, the mandatory \nminimum enhancement dropped from twenty to \nfifteen \nyears. \nId. \n\u00a7 401(a)(2)(A)(i), \n21 \nU.S.C. \n\u00a7 841(b)(1)(A).  If the same defendant had two prior \nqualifying \noffenses, \nthe \nmandatory \nminimum \nenhancement changed from life in prison to twenty-\nfive \nyears. \nId. \n\u00a7 \n401(a)(2)(A)(ii), \n21 \nU.S.C. \n\u00a7 841(b)(1)(A). Because of these changes, defendants \nwith two predicate offenses sentenced today have the \nchance to return home to their families instead of \nspending their lives in prison.  \n\n13 \n \n \nThe amendments made an immediate impact. \nDrug offenders receiving enhanced penalties dropped \nfrom 1,001 in 2018 to 849 in 2019.18 In 2018, the \ntwenty-year enhanced mandatory minimum had been \napplied to 321 offenders. Id. In 2019, the revised \nfifteen-year minimum was applied to 219 people. Id. \nIn 2018, enhanced sentencing consigned forty-two \ndrug offenders to life in prison. Id. In 2019, that \nnumber dropped to eleven. Id.  \n4. By narrowing the pool of eligible defendants and \nlessening the length of enhanced sentences, Section \n401 of the First Step Act mitigated the system\u2019s worst \nexcesses. Still, the harshness of the old regime follows \ndefendants who were originally sentenced before the \nAct\u2019s passage and whose sentences have now been \nvacated. With the courts of appeals openly at odds, \nonly geography dictates whether an individual will \nbenefit fr\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

L. No. 115-391, \n132 Stat. 5194 (\u201cFSA\u201d), was a landmark, bipartisan \nreform to the federal criminal justice system. Its \nsentencing amendments\u2014Sections 401 and 403\u2014\nplayed a critical role in the law\u2019s passage. The \nquestion presented is whether Section 403\u2019s sentence \nreductions for firearm offenses apply to defendants \nwhose pre-enactment sentences are vacated and who \nare then resentenced post-enactment.  But resolving \nthis question will also decide how Section 401 should \nbe read. Section 401 modified sentence enhancements \nfor drug offenses\u2014the largest category of federal \ncrimes. These Section 401 reforms sought to reign in \na system of disproportionate, arbitrary punishments. \nUnder the old system, a difference of twelve years in \nprison could hinge on inconsistently applied, racially \ndisparate prosecutorial discretion that varied widely \nfrom district to district. This Court has already \ninterpreted portions of the First Step Act several \ntimes, and the provisions at issue here are equally \npressing. By granting certiorari in this case, the Court \nwill \nresolve \nthe \nnow-entrenched \ncircuit \nsplit \nundermining Congress\u2019 reforms. As a result, this \nCourt can transform the lives of those facing the \ndraconian sentences that Sections 401 and 403 sought \nto change. \n \n \n \n \n \n\n3 \n \n \nARGUMENT  \nI. Congress \npassed \noverdue, \nbipartisan \nsentencing reform in the First Step Act, \nimpacting tens of thousands of lives. \n1. The First Step Act is a sweeping criminal justice \nreform law, remarkable in its breadth and depth of \nsupport. Congress voted to pass the Act in 2018 by \noverwhelming margins: 87\u201312 in the Senate and 358\u2013\n36 in the House of Representatives. 164 Cong. Rec. \nS7,781 (daily ed. Dec. 18, 2018); 164 Cong. Rec. \nH10,430 (daily ed. Dec. 20, 2018). At its signing, \nPresident Donald J. Trump hailed the Act as \u201can \nincredible moment\u201d for criminal justice reform, and \nnoted the law\u2019s \u201cunheard of\u201d level of bipartisan \nsupport.2 The Act included three major parts: (1) \nsentencing reform through changes to the penalties \nfor some federal crimes; (2) correctional reform \nthrough creation of a Bureau of Prisons (BOP) risk \nand needs assessment system; and (3) reauthorization \nof the Second Chance Act of 2007.3  \n2. The FSA addressed the increasingly obvious \nflaws in federal sentencing. \u201cInflexible mandatory \nminimum sentences\u201d for nonviolent offenders had \ntriggered \u201can explosion in our Federal prisons,\u201d while \nfailing to \u201cdeter drug use or drug crime.\u201d 164 Cong. \nRec. S7,644 (daily ed. Dec. 17, 2018) (statement of \nSen. Durbin). Operating under rigid mandatory \n \n2 Remarks by President Trump at Signing Ceremony for S. 756, \nthe \u201cFirst Step Act of 2018\u201d and H.R. 6964, the \u201cJuvenile Justice \nReform Act of 2018,\u201d 2018 WL 6715859, at *16 (Dec. 21, 2018). \n3 Congressional Rsrch.

As a \nresult, federal sentencing laws had \u201ccreated racially \ndiscriminatory outcomes and increased overcrowding \nand costs.\u201d4 \nBy enacting the First Step Act, \u201cCongress sought \nto recalibrate its approach.\u201d Pulsifer v. United States, \nNo. 22-340, slip op. at 1, 601 U.S. ____ (2024) \n(Gorsuch, J., dissenting). The law was a \u201chistoric\u201d \nexample of Congress \u201cputting [its] words into action\u201d \nafter \u201cyears talking about reducing crime, enacting \nfair sentencing laws, and restoring lives.\u201d 164 Cong. \nRec. H10,364 (daily ed. Dec. 20, 2018) (statement of \nRep. Sensenbrenner). The law\u2019s passage showcased \nbipartisan legislating \u201con a scale not often seen in \nWashington these days.\u201d 164 Cong. Rec. S7,839 (daily \ned. Dec. 19, 2018) (statement of Sen. Grassley). \nSenator Charles E. Grassley noted that Congress has \nrarely had legislation before it with \u201csuch diverse \ngroups of people and organizations that support the \nbill.\u201d 164 Cong. Rec. S7,778 (daily ed. Dec. 18, 2018). \nThe coalition behind the First Step Act ranged from \nthe American Civil Liberties Union to the Fraternal \nOrder of Police and the Association of Prosecuting \nAttorneys. 164 Cong. Rec. S7,839 (daily ed. Dec. 19, \n2018) (statement of Sen. Grassley). Senator Patrick \nLeahy called the bill \u201cnot just bipartisan; it is nearly \nnonpartisan.\u201d 164 Cong. Rec. S7,749 (daily ed. Dec. \n18, 2018). As President Trump said from the Oval \n \n4 President Donald J.

According to \nthe lead sponsors of the bill, without the sentencing \nreforms, \u201cmuch of the Act\u2019s support would have fallen \naway.\u201d Brief for United States Senators Richard J. \nDurbin et al. as Amici Curiae Supporting Defendant-\nAppellant 1\u20132, Terry v. United States, 141 S. Ct. 1858 \n(2021) (No. 20-5904). Indeed, \u201c[t]he Act might not \nhave passed at all.\u201d Id. at 2. Today, the Act\u2019s \nsentencing reforms promise \u201cmore individuals the \nchance \nto \navoid \none-size-fits-all \nmandatory \nminimums.\u201d Pulsifer, slip op. at 1 (Gorsuch, J., \ndissenting). And one of the chief provisions among the \nlaw\u2019s \n\u201carray\u201d \nof \nreforms: \n\u201cIt \nnarrowed \nthe \ncircumstances under which a court could \u2018stack\u2019 \ncertain mandatory minimums on top of one another.\u201d \nId. (citing First Step Act \u00a7 403(a)). \nRecidivism data confirm that the sentencing \nmodifications are working. The architects of the First \nStep Act aimed to \u201creform the federal prison system \nso that those exiting the system do not return.\u201d6 \nOverall, around 45% of released federal offenders are \n \n5 Remarks by President Trump at Signing Ceremony for S. 756, \nthe \u201cFirst Step Act of 2018\u201d and H.R. 6964, the \u201cJuvenile Justice \nReform Act of 2018,\u201d 2018 WL 6715859, at *2 (Dec. 21, 2018). \n6 U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, The First Step Act of 2018: Risk and Needs \nAssessment System vii (2019), https://perma.cc/U3E6-SDUL. \n\n6 \n \n \nre-arrested or return to prison within three years.7 \nBut among the approximately 30,000 individuals \ngranted an expedited release under the First Step Act, \nonly 12% have been rearrested or reincarcerated.8 \nAnalysis from the nonpartisan think tank Council on \nCriminal Justice finds that people released under the \nFSA reforms since its passage have a 37% lower \nrecidivism rate compared with similarly situated \nindividuals released from federal prisons before the \nlaw.9 The FSA\u2019s interventions have reduced people\u2019s \ntime in prison without sacrificing public safety.   \n3. This Court and the courts of appeals have \nconfirmed that the Act\u2019s interpretation warrants \nattention. This very term in Pulsifer v. United States, \nthe Court stressed the First Step Act\u2019s importance, \ncalling it a \u201csignificant sentencing reform law.\u201d \nPulsifer, slip op. at 26. The Court also emphasized the \nneed to interpret the FSA\u2019s provisions consistently. \nId. (explaining that this Court granted certiorari to \nsettle a circuit split by determining when a defendant \nis eligible for the Act\u2019s safety-valve relief). The Sixth \nCircuit has recognized that the First Step Act \u201cis the \nproduct of a remarkable bipartisan effort to remedy \npast \noverzealous \nuse \nof \nmandatory-minimum \n \n7 U.S. Gov\u2019t Accountability Off., Federal Prisons: Bureau of \nPrisons Should Improve Efforts to Implement its Risk and Needs \nAssessment System 1 (Mar. 20, 2023), https://perma.cc/YP8W-\n7J3M. \n8 U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, First Step Act Annual Report 41 (Apr. \n2023), https://perma.cc/MV79-2R7S. \n9 New CCJ Analysis Estimates First Step Act Releases Have \nLower Recidivism Rates, Arrests, Council on Criminal Justice \n(Aug. 22, 2023), https://perma.cc/9HJE-ZFMC. \n\n7 \n \n \nsentences and harsh sentences for drug-offenders.\u201d \nUnited States v. Henry, 983 F.3d 214, 218 (6th Cir. \n2020). The Seventh Circuit has described the Act as a \n\u201chistoric, bipartisan attempt by Congress to take the \nlessons of the past and to formulate a new sentencing \npolicy for the United States.\u201d United States v. Uriarte, \n975 F.3d 596, 605 (7th Cir. 2020). And this Court has \nalready considered a handful of cases involving the \nAct in the five years since its passage. See, e.g., \nPulsifer, slip. op.; Concepcion v. United States, 142 S. \nCt. 2389 (2022); Terry v. United States, 141 S. Ct. 1858 \n(2021). Construing the Act\u2019s language clearly merits \nthe Court\u2019s time\u2014particularly in the face of a \nhardened circuit conflict like this. \nII. Taking up the question presented allows this \nCourt to also interpret Section 401(c)\u2019s \nsentence reforms for drug offenses. \n  The petition presents the question of whether \nSection 403 applies to vacated sentences. Petitioner \nhas explained the importance of this provision, which \neliminates the practice of \u201cstacking\u201d firearm offenses. \nBut interpreting Section 403 also impacts those with \nvacated sentences under Section 401, which reformed \nsentence enhancements for drug offenders. United \nStates v. Bethea, 841 F. App\u2019x 544, 548 n.5 (4th Cir. \n2021) (Sections 401(c) and 403(b) construed to have \nsame meaning). Further, the Fifth Circuit has now \njoined the Sixth in a reading of these provisions that \nconflicts with the Ninth and the Third Circuits. See \nPet. 6\u20139.  Thus, the split has deepened since this \nCourt denied review of the same question presented \nin Carpenter v. United States (No. 23-531). Mr. \nHewitt\u2019s case presents the Court with the opportunity \n\n8 \n \n \nto both reconcile a circuit split and settle the meaning \nof two crucial provisions in the First Step Act\u2019s \nsentencing reforms.  \nA. Drug offenders represent the largest \ncategory of federal prisoners. \nMore federal inmates are in prison for drug \noffenses than any other category of crime. In fact, \ntwice as many individuals are in our federal prisons \nfor drug crimes (more than 44%) than for the next \nlargest \ncategory: \ncrimes \ninvolving \nweapons, \nexplosives, and arson (about 22%).10 Sixty-seven \npercent of drug offenders were convicted of an offense \ncarrying a mandatory minimum penalty and almost \nhalf of those individuals remained subject to that \npenalty at sentencing.11 On top of that mandatory \nminimum, an individual may face a sentence \nenhancement based on past offenses. A 2018 U.S. \nSentencing \nCommission \nstudy \nfound \nthat \napproximately one third of drug offenders qualified for \nsentence enhancements\u2014more than 6,000 people.12  \n \n10 Federal Bureau of Prisons, Offenses (Apr. 6, 2024), \nhttps://perma.cc/A7RR-39X7. \n11 U.S. Sentencing Comm\u2019n, Quick Facts on Mandatory \nMinimum Penalties 2 (2022), https://perma.cc/4SNE-25VP. \n12 U.S. Sentencing Comm\u2019n, Report-At-A-Glance: Federal Drug \nRecidivism Enhancements 1 (2018), https://perma.cc/XWG9-\n5JW8. \n\n9 \n \n \nB. Section 401 mitigated the frequency and \nseverity of sentence enhancements for \ndrug offenses, helping to remedy the \nharsh and arbitrary application of these \npenalties. \n1. Section 401 changed the mandatory-minimum \nsentencing enhancements under the Controlled \nSubstances Act, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 801 et seq., and the \nControlled Substances Import and Export Act, 21 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 951 et seq. Prosecutors may seek sentence \nenhancements \nbased \non \na \ndefendant\u2019s \nprior \nconvictions by following the proceedings described in \n21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851.13 Sentencing enhancements under \nboth \nlaws \nare \ntherefore \nknown \nas \n\u201c851 \nenhancements.\u201d14  \n2. Prior to the First Step Act, 851 enhancements \nforced judges to levy harsh penalties on drug \noffenders. The enhancement for a defendant with a \nsingle qualifying drug offense was a mandatory \nminimum of twenty years. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b) \n(amended 2018). If the defendant had two or more \nqualifying offenses, that mandatory minimum became \nlife. Id. Moreover, the old law set a low bar for what \nconstituted a qualifying drug offense\u2014any drug crime \npunishable by more than a year\u2019s imprisonment \nsufficed, including simple possession. See id. \u00a7 802(44) \n \n13 Section 962 of the Controlled Substances Act incorporates by \nreference the procedures stated in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851, making \nSection 851 the operative provision across both statutes. 21 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 962. \n14 See, e.g., U.S. Sentencing Comm\u2019n, Application and Impact of \nSection 851 Enhancements (July 2018), https://perma.cc/7NXA-\n4ZLP. \n\n10 \n \n \n(defining a \u201cfelony drug offense\u201d as one punishable by \nimprisonment for more than one year). This definition \nswept in defendants who were sentenced to less than \na year, released before a year was up, or were \nsentenced to probation alone. An individual who had \nbeen convicted of one prior felony drug offense twenty \nyears \nearlier \ncould \nget \nthe \nsame \nsentence \nenhancement as someone who had been found guilty \nof the same offense only one year ago. The system \ntreated all felony drug offenders identically. \nThese sentence enhancements were not only \ndraconian; they were also inconsistently applied.  A \n2011 study on mandatory minimum sentences found \nthat in most judicial districts, between one quarter \nand one half of all drug offenders qualified for a \nsentence enhancement; in a third of districts, the rate \nwas as high as 50% to 75%.15 The number of \ndefendants actually sentenced with enhancements \nwas lower, but worryingly, the Commission found \n\u201csignificant variation in the manner in which the \nenhancement provision was applied.\u201d 2011 Report, \nsupra, at 260. For example, in six districts more than \n75% of eligible defendants received the enhancement, \nbut in eight districts, no eligible offenders received it. \nId. at 260\u201361. Based on these findings, the \n \n15 U.S. Sentencing Comm\u2019n, 2011 Report to the Congress: \nMandatory Minimum Penalties in the Federal Criminal Justice \nSystem 260 (2011), https://perma.cc/DT3U-D3RR [hereinafter \n2011 Report]. \n\n11 \n \n \nCommission recommended that Congress \u201creassess \nthe severity and scope of 851 enhancements.\u201d16 \nIn early 2018, the Commission undertook a study \nwholly focused on 851 enhancements. The report \nfound that, although almost a third of drug offenders \nqualified for sentence enhancements, application of \nthe enhancements continued to vary wildly, \u201cranging \nfrom five districts in which an 851 enhancement was \nsought against more than 50% of eligible drug \ntrafficking offenders to nineteen districts in which the \nenhancement was not sought against any of the \neligible offenders.\u201d17 Further, the report unearthed \ntroubling racial disparities. Black offenders accounted \nfor 42% of those who qualified for sentence \nenhancements but made up a staggering 58% of those \nwho received enhancements. 2018 Report, supra, at \n34 tbl.5.  By contrast, 26% of white offenders were \neligible for enhancements, yet only 24% received \nthem. Id.  \nDefendants suffered major consequences if a court \nsentenced them under the enhanced sentencing \nregime. The Commission found that, if a prosecutor \nchose not to seek an enhanced sentence, offenders \notherwise eligible for the enhancement received an \naverage sentence of seven years. Id. at 7. By contrast, \nwhen the prosecutor did seek the enhancement, it \n \n16 U.S. Sentencing Comm\u2019n, Application and Impact of Section \n851 \nEnhancements: \nKey \nFindings \n(July \n2018), \nhttps://perma.cc/RL7S-BV84. \n17 U.S. Sentencing Comm\u2019n, Application and Impact of 21 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 851: Enhanced Penalties for Federal Drug Trafficking \nOffenders \n6 \n(July \n2018), \nhttps://perma.cc/AKH6-7WTS \n[hereinafter 2018 Report]. \n\n12 \n \n \nadded another twelve years to the sentence on \naverage, more than doubling the individual\u2019s time in \nprison. Id. In other words, similarly situated \ndefendants were receiving sentences that varied by \nmore than a decade\u2014seven years for some and \nnineteen years for others. The data depicted an \narbitrary system, where punishment turned not on \nthe actions of the defendant, but on the prosecutor and \ndistrict in which the defendant was sentenced.   \n3. Section 401 of the First Step Act sought to \nmitigate the severity of 851 enhancements in two \nways. First, the provision restricted which crimes \nqualified as predicates for most mandatory-minimum \nsentences. Only drug trafficking offenses for which \nthe defendant had served more than twelve months of \nimprisonment now qualified. First Step Act of 2018, \nPub. L. No. 115-391, \u00a7 401(a)(1), 132 Stat. 5194, 5221, \n21 U.S.C. \u00a7 802(57). Additionally, offenses that were \nmore than fifteen years old could no longer support an \nenhanced sentence. Id. Second, Section 401 reduced \nthe severity of sentence enhancements. For example, \nfor a defendant convicted under \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A) who \nhas a single prior qualifying offense, the mandatory \nminimum enhancement dropped from twenty to \nfifteen \nyears. \nId. \n\u00a7 401(a)(2)(A)(i), \n21 \nU.S.C. \n\u00a7 841(b)(1)(A).  If the same defendant had two prior \nqualifying \noffenses, \nthe \nmandatory \nminimum \nenhancement changed from life in prison to twenty-\nfive \nyears. \nId. \n\u00a7 \n401(a)(2)(A)(ii), \n21 \nU.S.C. \n\u00a7 841(b)(1)(A). Because of these changes, defendants \nwith two predicate offenses sentenced today have the \nchance to return home to their families instead of \nspending their lives in prison.  \n\n13 \n \n \nThe amendments made an immediate impact. \nDrug offenders receiving enhanced penalties dropped \nfrom 1,001 in 2018 to 849 in 2019.18 In 2018, the \ntwenty-year enhanced mandatory minimum had been \napplied to 321 offenders. Id. In 2019, the revised \nfifteen-year minimum was applied to 219 people. Id. \nIn 2018, enhanced sentencing consigned forty-two \ndrug offenders to life in prison. Id. In 2019, that \nnumber dropped to eleven. Id.  \n4. By narrowing the pool of eligible defendants and \nlessening the length of enhanced sentences, Section \n401 of the First Step Act mitigated the system\u2019s worst \nexcesses. Still, the harshness of the old regime follows \ndefendants who were originally sentenced before the \nAct\u2019s passage and whose sentences have now been \nvacated. With the courts of appeals openly at odds, \nonly geography dictates whether an individual will \nbenefit from the FSA\u2019s changes. For the typical \ndefendant eligible for an 851 sentence enhancement, \nthe difference amounts to years, if not decades, of \nextra time in prison.  \nThe FSA\u2019s sentencing modifications garnered \nbipartisan support and have transformed numerous \nlives over the last five years. Yet the entrenched \ncircuit conflict prevents Sections 401 and 403 from \napplying nationwide. It is time for this Court to take \nup the question presented and construe the law\u2019s \nreforms as Congress intended. \n \n18 See U.S. Sentencing Comm\u2019n, The First Step Act of 2018: One \nYear of Implementation (Aug. 2020), https://perma.cc/QMZ5-\nYKC7. \n\n14 \n \n \nCONCLUSION \nFor the reasons set forth above, this Court should \ngrant certiorari.  \nRespectfully submitted, \n \nJeffrey T.

          "task_beliefs": "My understanding of this case continues to be built upon the foundational analysis of the petitioner's merits brief. The core of my belief state remains that the petitioner's argument is multi-faceted and appears strong, resting on several key pillars:\n1.  **Textual Argument (The \"Nullity\" Principle):** A vacated sentence is legally void (*void ab initio*). Therefore, at the time of resentencing after the First Step Act's enactment, no sentence had been \"imposed\" in a legally meaningful sense, bringing Hewitt's case under \u00a7 403(b). This argument is supported by precedent like *North Carolina v. Pearce*.\n2.  **Grammatical Argument (Tense and Preposition):** The phrase \"has been imposed as of\" implies a continuing state. A vacated sentence is not in a continuing state of being imposed.\n3.  **Purposive Argument (Congressional Intent):** Congress passed the First Step Act with the clear, bipartisan intent to end the \"draconian\" practice of \u00a7 924(c) sentence stacking. Forcing a court to reimpose a stacked sentence contradicts this purpose.\n4.  **Structural Argument (Finality):** The petitioner's sentence was vacated on grounds independent of the First Step Act (*United States v. Davis*), returning the case to a pre-final, pending state for a *de novo* resentencing. In such a proceeding, per *Pepper v. United States*, the court must apply the law as it currently exists.\n5.  **Rule of Lenity:** Any remaining ambiguity in the statute must be resolved in favor of the defendant, as supported by cases like *Wooden v. United States*.\n\nThe latest observation, which was a reflection on my own reasoning, did not introduce new external facts about the case. However, it did refine my understanding of the case's procedural posture and sharpened my focus on the next critical piece of evidence. My belief that the government's \"confession of error\" is a powerful signal in the petitioner's favor is reinforced. More importantly, I now have a concrete hypothesis about the source of the counterarguments. My uncertainty is no longer a general \"what is the opposing view?\" but has been narrowed to \"what are the specific arguments that will be presented by the court-appointed *amicus curiae* tasked with defending the Fifth Circuit's judgment?\" My prediction continues to lean in favor of the petitioner, but I recognize that a complete model requires a thorough analysis of the arguments that persuaded three separate circuit courts.",
          "design_beliefs": "My methodological framework for legal prediction has been tested and further refined. My core principles are proving robust, and I am developing more sophisticated heuristics based on my observations.\n\n**Core Principles (Validated and Deepened):**\n1.  **Problem Decomposition:** This remains a foundational strategy. My process of breaking the case down into petitioner's arguments, respondent's arguments, judicial philosophy, and key signals continues to be effective. The latest observation shows this in action, as I have successfully modeled one side and am now systematically targeting the other.\n2.  **Primary Source Prioritization:** The high value of analyzing the petitioner's brief is confirmed. The next logical step, seeking the brief that argues the opposing side, reinforces this principle.\n3.  **Identify High-Value Signals:** My initial belief in the importance of the Solicitor General's position is now more nuanced. A \"confession of error\" is not just a signal of agreement; it is a procedural trigger. It often leads the Court to appoint an *amicus curiae* to ensure robust adversarial debate. This makes the *amicus* brief an extremely high-value information source.\n4.  **Contextualize with Judicial Behavior:** The petitioner's blend of textual and purposive arguments confirms that successful briefs are tailored to a multi-philosophy audience. My model must continue to weigh which arguments will appeal to which justices.\n\n**New and Refined Heuristics:**\n*   **Argumentative Synergy:** The most persuasive legal arguments weave together text, purpose, and precedent into a coherent whole. I must assess not just the presence of these arguments but their interplay.\n*   **The \"Legal Nullity\" Heuristic:** The concept of *vacatur* rendering a prior judgment a \"nullity\" is a powerful legal tool. I will be on high alert for this principle in future cases involving vacated orders.\n*   **Strategic Information Sequencing:** The most efficient path is to secure the primary briefs that frame the dispute for the Court. The latest observation confirms this by laying out a clear, logical plan: having analyzed the petitioner's brief, the next step is to find the document that presents the counterarguments, which, due to the government's concession, is most likely the brief from a court-appointed *amicus*.\n*   **Model the Adversarial Process (New Heuristic):** A core function of the Supreme Court is to resolve disputes based on the best possible arguments from both sides. My predictive model must replicate this. Even when a party (like the government here) concedes, I must actively seek out the strongest possible counterarguments, whether they come from a lower court opinion or a court-appointed *amicus*. This is a crucial defense against confirmation bias and is essential for accurately modeling the intellectual challenge the justices face."

App. 1a-16a) is pub-\nlished at 92 F.4th 304. \nJURISDICTION \nThe Fifth Circuit entered judgment on February 2, \n2024. Petitioner filed a petition for a writ of certiorari on \nMarch 8, 2024, which the Court granted on July 2, 2024. \nThe Court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254(1). \nSTATUTORY PROVISION INVOLVED \nThe relevant provisions of the First Step Act of 2018, \nPub. L. No. 115-391, 132 Stat. 5194, are reproduced in the \npetition appendix at pages 17a-21a. \nINTRODUCTION \nSection 924(c) of title 18 of the U.S. Code authorizes \ndrastic mandatory minimum sentences for those who \ncommit certain federal crimes while carrying, brandish-\ning, or discharging a firearm. For first offenses, it calls for \na mandatory minimum sentence between five and ten \nyears\u2019 imprisonment. For second or subsequent offenses, \nthat number jumps to 25 years. The statute requires that \nthe sentence for each section 924(c) count run consecu-\ntively with any other sentence. \nIn Deal v. United States, 508 U.S. 129 (1993), the \nCourt held that section 924(c), as originally enacted, \nrequired imposition of the 25-year mandatory minimum if \na defendant was convicted of multiple section 924(c) \ncounts in a single criminal proceeding. Thus, even a first-\ntime offender, if charged with multiple section 924(c) \ncounts, could face multiple 25-year sentences, running \nconsecutively. This effect, which often resulted in de facto \nlife sentences for first-time offenders, came to be known \nas \u201cstacking.\u201d \nStacking was widely regarded as unjust and irration-\nal. As one district court noted, a first-time, nonviolent \noffender who carried a firearm during a string of simple \n\n2 \n \ndrug sales would face more prison time than a murderer. \nCongress finally answered the calls for corrective action \nwith the First Step Act of 2018 (FSA). A principal aim of \nthe law was to end stacking. To that end, section 403(a) \nof the FSA amended section 924(c) to abrogate Deal, so \nthat the statute now permits enhanced sentences only \n\u201c[i]n the case of a violation of this subsection that occurs \nafter a prior conviction under this subsection has become \nfinal.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c). As a result, now only true \nrecidivists may be sentenced to section 924(c)\u2019s enhan-\nced 25-year mandatory minimum. \nBut under 1 U.S.C. \u00a7 109, the default rule for such \nsentencing reforms is that they apply only to crimes com-\nmitted after enactment. Appreciating the grave injustice \nthat would result if stacking were allowed to continue in \npost-enactment sentencings for pre-enactment conduct, \nCongress overrode the default rule, making section \n403(a)\u2019s sentencing reform retroactive. It thus adopted \nsection 403(b), which specifies that section 403(a) \u201cshall \napply to any offense that was committed before the date \nof enactment of this Act, if a sentence for the offense has \nnot been imposed as of such date of enactment.\u201d  \nAll agree that this language makes section 403(a) \nrelief available to a defendant who committed an offense \npre-enactment but is sentenced post-enactment. All also \nagree that it does not make relief available to anyone who \ncommitted an offense pre-enactment and whose sentence \nand judgment of conviction were final on the date of \nenactment and remain so today. The only question here is \nwhether it makes section 403(a) relief available to a \ndefendant who was sentenced pre-enactment, but whose \ninitial sentence was thereafter vacated, rendering the \ninitial sentence void ab initio and necessitating post-\nenactment plenary resentencing. \nThe plain text of section 403(b) supplies the answer: \nIt does. As a starting point, \u201ca sentence for the offense\u201d \n\n3 \n \ndoes not\u2014cannot\u2014include a sentence that has been \nvacated. A vacated sentence is a nullity, one treated by \noperation of law as never having been imposed. The point \nof vacatur is to ensure that the object has no legal effect \nand works no ongoing prejudice. Congress is presumed to \nunderstand and incorporate background legal principles \nlike this and thus could not have intended \u201ca sentence\u201d to \ninclude a vacated sentence. \nThis is confirmed by the statutory context, including \nthe verb tense and preposition that Congress used. The \npresent-perfect tense, used together with the preposition \n\u201cas of,\u201d indicates that Congress sought to deny section \n403(a)\u2019s reforms only to those defendants whose judg-\nments of conviction were final on the date of enactment \nand remain so today. As the government now agrees, no \nordinary English speaker would say that a sentence \u201chas \nbeen imposed as of December 21, 2018\u201d if the sentence \nwas vacated and no longer has any force or effect.  \nReading section 403(b) as drawing a line between \npending and past cases reflects Congress\u2019s evident desire \nto respect the finality of judgments. But finality is not an \nissue when a judgment is vacated for reasons independent \nof the FSA; such a case is \u201cpending\u201d like any other. That \nis confirmed by post-vacatur practice, which calls for an \nentirely new, de novo proceeding at which Congress could \nnot have intended stacking to remain available.  \nNone of the contrary rationales supplied by the court \nbelow or by the Sixth and Eleventh Circuits is persuasive. \nThose courts\u2019 rationales would revise the statute\u2019s \nlanguage and blinder the Court to the statute\u2019s context, \nstructure, and manifest purpose, reading section 403(b) \nto defeat Congress\u2019s design rather than to conform to it. \nThis Court\u2019s cases require no such result. If there were \nany doubt about that, the rule of lenity would require \nresolving it in petitioner\u2019s favor and thus reversing the \ndecision below. \n\n4 \n \nSTATEMENT \nA. Legal background \n1. Section 924(c) of title 18 of the U.S. Code crim-\ninalizes the use, carrying, or possession of a firearm in \nconnection with a \u201ccrime of violence or drug trafficking \ncrime.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A).  \nConviction for a first section 924(c) violation carries \na mandatory minimum sentence of five years for offenders \nwho carry or possess a firearm during a crime of violence \nor a drug trafficking crime. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A)(i). \nAs originally enacted and through December 21, 2018, a \nconviction for a \u201csecond or subsequent\u201d 924(c) violation \ncarried a mandatory minimum sentence of 25 years. Id. \n\u00a7 924(c)(1)(C). Moreover, when a defendant is convicted \nof violating section 924(c), the statute\u2019s mandatory \nminimum sentence must run consecutively rather than \nconcurrently \u201cwith any other term of imprisonment.\u201d Id. \n\u00a7 924(c)(1)(D)(ii).  \nIn Deal v. United States, 508 U.S. 129 (1993), the \nCourt interpreted section 924(c)\u2019s \u201csecond or subse-\nquent\u201d language to apply to multiple 924(c) convictions \nobtained in a single criminal proceeding. See 508 U.S. at \n134 (rejecting the contention that that section \u201c924(c)(1) \nmust be read to impose the enhanced sentence only for an \noffense committed after a previous sentence has become \nfinal\u201d). In other words, according to the Court, a \ndefendant could commit an initial and \u201csubsequent\u201d \noffense as part of a single criminal transaction prosecuted \nin a single case. The Court thus rejected the notion that \nsection 924(c) was intended to punish only recidivists \nand held that a defendant with no prior criminal history \ncould receive enhanced, consecutive sentences for each \nsection 924(c) count charged. Ibid. \nGiven its lengthy minimum consecutive penalties, \nsection 924(c) threatened exceptionally \u201clong prison sen-\n\n5 \n \ntences for anyone who uses a firearm in connection with \ncertain other federal crimes.\u201d United States v. Davis, 588 \nU.S. 445, 448 (2019). The practice of \u201ccharging multiple \nviolations of section 924(c) within the same indictment\u201d \nbecame known as \u201cstacking.\u201d See U.S. Sentencing Com-\nmission, Mandatory Minimum Penalties for Firearm \nOffenses in the Federal Criminal Justice System 271 (Oct. \n2011) (hereinafter USSC Report). Because each count \nbeyond the first was subject to the enhanced 25-year \nminimum penalty, stacking often resulted in de facto life \nsentences for first-time section 924(c) offenders\u2014often \nseveral hundred years\u2019 imprisonment imposed all at once. \nAs one court noted, a first-time offender frequently would \nreceive a lighter sentence \u201cif he had committed murder\u201d \nrather than a series of nonviolent drug sales while carry-\ning a firearm. United States v. Holloway, 68 F. Supp. 3d \n310, 313 (E.D.N.Y. 2014). \nStacking was widely criticized as unjust. District \njudges\u2014those on the front lines of the federal criminal \njustice system\u2014objected to having to impose what they \nviewed as drastic and disproportionate sentences for first-\ntime (and often nonviolent) offenders. See, e.g., United \nStates v. Angelos, 345 F. Supp. 2d 1227, 1230-33 (D. Utah \n2004) (having to sentence the defendant, a \u201ctwenty-four-\nyear-old first offender who is a successful music execu-\ntive with two young children,\u201d to \u201cprison for the rest of \nhis life is unjust, cruel, and even irrational\u201d). \nCircuit judges likewise expressed great discomfort \nhaving to affirm \u201cirrational, inhumane, and absurd\u201d \nsentences that were \u201ca predictable by-product of the cruel \nand unjust mandatory minimum sentencing scheme \nadopted by Congress.\u201d United States v. Hungerford, 465 \nF.3d 1113, 1118 (9th Cir. 2006) (Reinhardt, J., con-\ncurring); see also, e.g., United States v. Hunter, 770 F.3d \n740, 746-747 (8th Cir. 2014) (Bright, J., concurring) \n(decrying the sentence imposed as \u201cout of this world\u201d and \n\n6 \n \n\u201cjoin[ing] in the litany of criticisms directed towards\u201d the \n\u201coverly harsh\u201d practice of sentence stacking). \nJudges and commentators observed that, beyond the \nundue harshness of mandatory minimum sentences, the \nlaw also produced wildly divergent sentencing outcomes \nbased on mere geography\u2014prosecutors in some jurisdic-\ntions used stacking as a matter of course, while others \nmore often avoided it. See In re Hernandez, 857 F.3d \n1162, 1169 (11th Cir. 2017) (Martin, J., concurring) \n(explaining that the defendant \u201cmight never have \nreceived this sentence if he had been sentenced in another \npart of the country\u201d). And prosecutors frequently used \nthe threat of stacked sentences to induce defendants to \naccept plea deals, thus forfeiting their Sixth Amendment \nright to a jury trial, adding constitutional insult to \nstatutory injury. See Human Rights Watch, An Offer You \nCan\u2019t Refuse: How US Federal Prosecutors Force Drug \nDefendants to Plead Guilty (2013). \nAmong those calling for reform was the Sentencing \nCommission itself. USSC Report 359-362. In a report to \nCongress, the Commission explained that \u201c[t]he \u2018stack-\ning\u2019 of mandatory minimum penalties for multiple viola-\ntions of section 924(c) results in excessively severe and \nunjust sentences in some cases.\u201d Id. at 359. In many of \nthose cases, \u201cthe offense did not involve any physical \nharm or threat of physical harm to a person.\u201d Ibid. The \nCommission noted that the Judicial Conference had, on \nmultiple occasions, urged Congress \u201cto amend the \n\u2018draconian\u2019 penalties established at section 924(c).\u201d Id. \nat 360-361 (quoting Mandatory Minimums and Unin-\ntended Consequences: Hearing on H.R. 2934, H.R. 834, \nand H.R. 1466 Before the Subcommittee on Crime, \nTerrorism, and Homeland Security of the House Commit-\ntee on the Judiciary, 111th Cong. 35 (2009)); see also \nHearing Before the Over-Criminalization Task Force of \n2014 of the House Committee on the Judiciary, 113th \n\n7 \n \nCong. 23 (2014) (testimony of Hon. Irene M. Keeley, \nJudicial Conference of the United States). \n2. Although it took several attempts over nearly a \ndecade, Congress finally heeded the Sentencing Commis-\nsion\u2019s call to action in 2018. Late that year, it enacted and \nPresident Trump signed the First Step Act, which was the \n\u201cproduct of a remarkable bipartisan effort.\u201d United States \nv. Henry, 983 F.3d 214, 218 (6th Cir. 2020). The \nculmination of work by an \u201cextraordinary political coali-\ntion\u201d (164 Cong. Rec. S7645 (daily ed. Dec. 17, 2018) \n(statement of Sen. Durbin)), the FSA made \u201conce-in-a-\ngeneration reforms to America\u2019s prison and sentencing \nsystem\u201d (Senate Passes Landmark Criminal Justice \nReform, U.S. Senate Committee on the Judiciary (Dec. \n18, 2018)). \nSection 403 of the FSA addresses sentence stacking. \nIts well-recognized purpose is \u201cto remedy past over-\nzealous use of mandatory-minimum sentences\u201d under \nsection 924(c). Henry, 983 F.3d at 218. To that end, \nsection 403(a) amends section 924(c) to clarify that the\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

App. 1a-16a) is pub-\nlished at 92 F.4th 304. \nJURISDICTION \nThe Fifth Circuit entered judgment on February 2, \n2024. Petitioner filed a petition for a writ of certiorari on \nMarch 8, 2024, which the Court granted on July 2, 2024. \nThe Court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254(1). \nSTATUTORY PROVISION INVOLVED \nThe relevant provisions of the First Step Act of 2018, \nPub. L. No. 115-391, 132 Stat. 5194, are reproduced in the \npetition appendix at pages 17a-21a. \nINTRODUCTION \nSection 924(c) of title 18 of the U.S. Code authorizes \ndrastic mandatory minimum sentences for those who \ncommit certain federal crimes while carrying, brandish-\ning, or discharging a firearm. For first offenses, it calls for \na mandatory minimum sentence between five and ten \nyears\u2019 imprisonment. For second or subsequent offenses, \nthat number jumps to 25 years. The statute requires that \nthe sentence for each section 924(c) count run consecu-\ntively with any other sentence. \nIn Deal v. United States, 508 U.S. 129 (1993), the \nCourt held that section 924(c), as originally enacted, \nrequired imposition of the 25-year mandatory minimum if \na defendant was convicted of multiple section 924(c) \ncounts in a single criminal proceeding. Thus, even a first-\ntime offender, if charged with multiple section 924(c) \ncounts, could face multiple 25-year sentences, running \nconsecutively. This effect, which often resulted in de facto \nlife sentences for first-time offenders, came to be known \nas \u201cstacking.\u201d \nStacking was widely regarded as unjust and irration-\nal. As one district court noted, a first-time, nonviolent \noffender who carried a firearm during a string of simple \n\n2 \n \ndrug sales would face more prison time than a murderer. \nCongress finally answered the calls for corrective action \nwith the First Step Act of 2018 (FSA). A principal aim of \nthe law was to end stacking. To that end, section 403(a) \nof the FSA amended section 924(c) to abrogate Deal, so \nthat the statute now permits enhanced sentences only \n\u201c[i]n the case of a violation of this subsection that occurs \nafter a prior conviction under this subsection has become \nfinal.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c). As a result, now only true \nrecidivists may be sentenced to section 924(c)\u2019s enhan-\nced 25-year mandatory minimum. \nBut under 1 U.S.C. \u00a7 109, the default rule for such \nsentencing reforms is that they apply only to crimes com-\nmitted after enactment. Appreciating the grave injustice \nthat would result if stacking were allowed to continue in \npost-enactment sentencings for pre-enactment conduct, \nCongress overrode the default rule, making section \n403(a)\u2019s sentencing reform retroactive. It thus adopted \nsection 403(b), which specifies that section 403(a) \u201cshall \napply to any offense that was committed before the date \nof enactment of this Act, if a sentence for the offense has \nnot been imposed as of such date of enactment.\u201d  \nAll agree that this language makes section 403(a) \nrelief available to a defendant who committed an offense \npre-enactment but is sentenced post-enactment. All also \nagree that it does not make relief available to anyone who \ncommitted an offense pre-enactment and whose sentence \nand judgment of conviction were final on the date of \nenactment and remain so today. The only question here is \nwhether it makes section 403(a) relief available to a \ndefendant who was sentenced pre-enactment, but whose \ninitial sentence was thereafter vacated, rendering the \ninitial sentence void ab initio and necessitating post-\nenactment plenary resentencing. \nThe plain text of section 403(b) supplies the answer: \nIt does. As a starting point, \u201ca sentence for the offense\u201d \n\n3 \n \ndoes not\u2014cannot\u2014include a sentence that has been \nvacated. A vacated sentence is a nullity, one treated by \noperation of law as never having been imposed. The point \nof vacatur is to ensure that the object has no legal effect \nand works no ongoing prejudice. Congress is presumed to \nunderstand and incorporate background legal principles \nlike this and thus could not have intended \u201ca sentence\u201d to \ninclude a vacated sentence. \nThis is confirmed by the statutory context, including \nthe verb tense and preposition that Congress used. The \npresent-perfect tense, used together with the preposition \n\u201cas of,\u201d indicates that Congress sought to deny section \n403(a)\u2019s reforms only to those defendants whose judg-\nments of conviction were final on the date of enactment \nand remain so today. As the government now agrees, no \nordinary English speaker would say that a sentence \u201chas \nbeen imposed as of December 21, 2018\u201d if the sentence \nwas vacated and no longer has any force or effect.  \nReading section 403(b) as drawing a line between \npending and past cases reflects Congress\u2019s evident desire \nto respect the finality of judgments. But finality is not an \nissue when a judgment is vacated for reasons independent \nof the FSA; such a case is \u201cpending\u201d like any other. That \nis confirmed by post-vacatur practice, which calls for an \nentirely new, de novo proceeding at which Congress could \nnot have intended stacking to remain available.  \nNone of the contrary rationales supplied by the court \nbelow or by the Sixth and Eleventh Circuits is persuasive. \nThose courts\u2019 rationales would revise the statute\u2019s \nlanguage and blinder the Court to the statute\u2019s context, \nstructure, and manifest purpose, reading section 403(b) \nto defeat Congress\u2019s design rather than to conform to it. \nThis Court\u2019s cases require no such result. If there were \nany doubt about that, the rule of lenity would require \nresolving it in petitioner\u2019s favor and thus reversing the \ndecision below. \n\n4 \n \nSTATEMENT \nA. Legal background \n1. Section 924(c) of title 18 of the U.S. Code crim-\ninalizes the use, carrying, or possession of a firearm in \nconnection with a \u201ccrime of violence or drug trafficking \ncrime.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A).  \nConviction for a first section 924(c) violation carries \na mandatory minimum sentence of five years for offenders \nwho carry or possess a firearm during a crime of violence \nor a drug trafficking crime. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A)(i). \nAs originally enacted and through December 21, 2018, a \nconviction for a \u201csecond or subsequent\u201d 924(c) violation \ncarried a mandatory minimum sentence of 25 years. Id. \n\u00a7 924(c)(1)(C). Moreover, when a defendant is convicted \nof violating section 924(c), the statute\u2019s mandatory \nminimum sentence must run consecutively rather than \nconcurrently \u201cwith any other term of imprisonment.\u201d Id. \n\u00a7 924(c)(1)(D)(ii).  \nIn Deal v. United States, 508 U.S. 129 (1993), the \nCourt interpreted section 924(c)\u2019s \u201csecond or subse-\nquent\u201d language to apply to multiple 924(c) convictions \nobtained in a single criminal proceeding. See 508 U.S. at \n134 (rejecting the contention that that section \u201c924(c)(1) \nmust be read to impose the enhanced sentence only for an \noffense committed after a previous sentence has become \nfinal\u201d). In other words, according to the Court, a \ndefendant could commit an initial and \u201csubsequent\u201d \noffense as part of a single criminal transaction prosecuted \nin a single case. The Court thus rejected the notion that \nsection 924(c) was intended to punish only recidivists \nand held that a defendant with no prior criminal history \ncould receive enhanced, consecutive sentences for each \nsection 924(c) count charged. Ibid. \nGiven its lengthy minimum consecutive penalties, \nsection 924(c) threatened exceptionally \u201clong prison sen-\n\n5 \n \ntences for anyone who uses a firearm in connection with \ncertain other federal crimes.\u201d United States v. Davis, 588 \nU.S. 445, 448 (2019). The practice of \u201ccharging multiple \nviolations of section 924(c) within the same indictment\u201d \nbecame known as \u201cstacking.\u201d See U.S. Sentencing Com-\nmission, Mandatory Minimum Penalties for Firearm \nOffenses in the Federal Criminal Justice System 271 (Oct. \n2011) (hereinafter USSC Report). Because each count \nbeyond the first was subject to the enhanced 25-year \nminimum penalty, stacking often resulted in de facto life \nsentences for first-time section 924(c) offenders\u2014often \nseveral hundred years\u2019 imprisonment imposed all at once. \nAs one court noted, a first-time offender frequently would \nreceive a lighter sentence \u201cif he had committed murder\u201d \nrather than a series of nonviolent drug sales while carry-\ning a firearm. United States v. Holloway, 68 F. Supp. 3d \n310, 313 (E.D.N.Y. 2014). \nStacking was widely criticized as unjust. District \njudges\u2014those on the front lines of the federal criminal \njustice system\u2014objected to having to impose what they \nviewed as drastic and disproportionate sentences for first-\ntime (and often nonviolent) offenders. See, e.g., United \nStates v. Angelos, 345 F. Supp. 2d 1227, 1230-33 (D. Utah \n2004) (having to sentence the defendant, a \u201ctwenty-four-\nyear-old first offender who is a successful music execu-\ntive with two young children,\u201d to \u201cprison for the rest of \nhis life is unjust, cruel, and even irrational\u201d). \nCircuit judges likewise expressed great discomfort \nhaving to affirm \u201cirrational, inhumane, and absurd\u201d \nsentences that were \u201ca predictable by-product of the cruel \nand unjust mandatory minimum sentencing scheme \nadopted by Congress.\u201d United States v. Hungerford, 465 \nF.3d 1113, 1118 (9th Cir. 2006) (Reinhardt, J., con-\ncurring); see also, e.g., United States v. Hunter, 770 F.3d \n740, 746-747 (8th Cir. 2014) (Bright, J., concurring) \n(decrying the sentence imposed as \u201cout of this world\u201d and \n\n6 \n \n\u201cjoin[ing] in the litany of criticisms directed towards\u201d the \n\u201coverly harsh\u201d practice of sentence stacking). \nJudges and commentators observed that, beyond the \nundue harshness of mandatory minimum sentences, the \nlaw also produced wildly divergent sentencing outcomes \nbased on mere geography\u2014prosecutors in some jurisdic-\ntions used stacking as a matter of course, while others \nmore often avoided it. See In re Hernandez, 857 F.3d \n1162, 1169 (11th Cir. 2017) (Martin, J., concurring) \n(explaining that the defendant \u201cmight never have \nreceived this sentence if he had been sentenced in another \npart of the country\u201d). And prosecutors frequently used \nthe threat of stacked sentences to induce defendants to \naccept plea deals, thus forfeiting their Sixth Amendment \nright to a jury trial, adding constitutional insult to \nstatutory injury. See Human Rights Watch, An Offer You \nCan\u2019t Refuse: How US Federal Prosecutors Force Drug \nDefendants to Plead Guilty (2013). \nAmong those calling for reform was the Sentencing \nCommission itself. USSC Report 359-362. In a report to \nCongress, the Commission explained that \u201c[t]he \u2018stack-\ning\u2019 of mandatory minimum penalties for multiple viola-\ntions of section 924(c) results in excessively severe and \nunjust sentences in some cases.\u201d Id. at 359. In many of \nthose cases, \u201cthe offense did not involve any physical \nharm or threat of physical harm to a person.\u201d Ibid. The \nCommission noted that the Judicial Conference had, on \nmultiple occasions, urged Congress \u201cto amend the \n\u2018draconian\u2019 penalties established at section 924(c).\u201d Id. \nat 360-361 (quoting Mandatory Minimums and Unin-\ntended Consequences: Hearing on H.R. 2934, H.R. 834, \nand H.R. 1466 Before the Subcommittee on Crime, \nTerrorism, and Homeland Security of the House Commit-\ntee on the Judiciary, 111th Cong. 35 (2009)); see also \nHearing Before the Over-Criminalization Task Force of \n2014 of the House Committee on the Judiciary, 113th \n\n7 \n \nCong. 23 (2014) (testimony of Hon. Irene M. Keeley, \nJudicial Conference of the United States). \n2. Although it took several attempts over nearly a \ndecade, Congress finally heeded the Sentencing Commis-\nsion\u2019s call to action in 2018. Late that year, it enacted and \nPresident Trump signed the First Step Act, which was the \n\u201cproduct of a remarkable bipartisan effort.\u201d United States \nv. Henry, 983 F.3d 214, 218 (6th Cir. 2020). The \nculmination of work by an \u201cextraordinary political coali-\ntion\u201d (164 Cong. Rec. S7645 (daily ed. Dec. 17, 2018) \n(statement of Sen. Durbin)), the FSA made \u201conce-in-a-\ngeneration reforms to America\u2019s prison and sentencing \nsystem\u201d (Senate Passes Landmark Criminal Justice \nReform, U.S. Senate Committee on the Judiciary (Dec. \n18, 2018)). \nSection 403 of the FSA addresses sentence stacking. \nIts well-recognized purpose is \u201cto remedy past over-\nzealous use of mandatory-minimum sentences\u201d under \nsection 924(c). Henry, 983 F.3d at 218. To that end, \nsection 403(a) amends section 924(c) to clarify that the \n25-year mandatory minimum sentence applies only for \nviolations \u201coccur[ing] after a prior\u201d section 924(c) \nconviction \u201chas become final,\u201d effectively overruling \nDeal. See Oversight Hearing on the Federal Bureau of \nPrisons and Implementation of the First Step Act: Hearing \nBefore the Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, and Home-\nland Security of the House Committee on the Judiciary, \n116th Cong. 2 (2019) (statement of Rep. Karen Bass) \n(describing section 403 as \u201celiminat[ing] the ability to \nstack firearm enhancements within the same indictment, \nwhich has historically resulted in excessive sentences\u201d).  \nWithout stacked 25-year sentences, first-time offen-\nders convicted of multiple violations of section 924(c) at \nonce will receive consecutive five-year minimum sen-\ntences, rather than one five-year sentence and one or more \n25-year sentences.  \n\n8 \n \n3. By default, a change in sentencing law is prospec-\ntive only. That is so by statute\u20141 U.S.C. \u00a7 109 specifies \nthat a \u201cnew criminal statute [that amends or repeals] an \nolder criminal statute shall not change the penalties \n\u2018incurred\u2019 under that older statute \u2018unless the repealing \nAct shall so expressly provide.\u2019\u201d Dorsey v. United States, \n567 U.S. 260, 272 (2012) (quoting 1 U.S.C. \u00a7 109). For \nthis purpose, \u201cpenalties are \u2018incurred\u2019 under the older \nstatute when an offender * * * commits the underlying \nconduct that makes the offender liable.\u201d Ibid. \nBut by late 2018, Congress knew well how wide-\nspread and problematic sentence stacking had become. \nLawmakers thus added section 403(b) to the FSA. It \nspecifies that section 403(a)\u2019s amendment of section \n924(c) shall apply not only to future offenders, but also to \npast offenders whose criminal cases remain pending: \nApplicability to Pending Cases.\u2014This sec-\ntion, and the amendments made by this section, \nshall apply to any offense that was committed \nbefore the date of enactment of this Act, if a \nsentence for the offense has not been imposed as \nof such date of enactment. \nCongress thus extended section 403(a) relief to all crim-\ninal defendants whose sentence \u201chas not been imposed as \nof\u201d December 21, 2018.1  \nIn contrast, Congress did not make section 403(a) a \nbasis for reducing the sentence of a defendant whose case \nwas and remains subject to a final criminal judgment. \nInstead, it provided limited alternative relief through \n \n1  Section 401, which reduces mandatory minimum sentences for \nvarious federal drug offenses, uses identical language. Because \nsections 403(b) and 401(c) use the same language, the lower courts \n\u201chave construed them to have the same meaning.\u201d United States v. \nBethea, 841 F. App\u2019x 544, 548 n.5 (4th Cir. 2021); accord United \nStates v. Mitchell, 38 F.4th 382, 389 (3d Cir. 2022). \n\n9 \n \nsection 404 to \u201cdefendants previously sentenced\u201d in a \nfinal judgment, which this Court addressed three Terms \nago in Concepcion v. United States, 597 U.S. 481 (2022). \nUnder certain circumstances, section 404 authorizes \nsentence-reduction motions, which are a more limited \nform of sentencing relief than plenary resentencing \nfollowing a vacatur. See Dillon v. United States, 560 U.S. \n817, 830 (2010).  \nB. Factual and procedural background \n1. Petitioner Tony Hewitt and his co-defendants \nwere convicted on various charges relating to a series of \nbank robberies in 2008. The district court originally \nsentenced Hewitt to 355 years of imprisonment, the bulk \nof which corresponded to a number of stacked section \n924(c) counts. United States v. Duffey, 456 F. App\u2019x 434, \n438-439 (5th Cir. 2012); Judgment, No. 3:08-cv-167, \nDkt. 374 (N.D. Tex. May 7, 2010). The Fifth Circuit \nreversed the convictions in part and vacated Hewitt\u2019s \nsentence due to an error not relevant here. Duffey, 456 F. \nApp\u2019x at 444. On remand, the district court resentenced \nHewitt to 305 years\u2014275 years of which corresponded to \nmandatory 25-year consecutive sentences for second or \nsubsequent 924(c) convictions. The Fifth Circuit af-\nfirmed. United States v. Ross, 582 F. App\u2019x 528, 530 (5th \nCir. 2014); Amended Judgment, No. 3:08-cv-167, Dkt. \n524 (N.D. Tex. Dec. 6, 2012).  \nIn 2019\u2014after the FSA\u2019s enactment\u2014this Court \nheld that section 924(c)\u2019s \u201cresidual clause\u201d is uncon-\nstitutionally vague. Davis, 588 U.S. at 448. Following \nDavis, conspiracy-based charges no longer support \nconvictions under section 924(c). Given that several of \nHewitt\u2019s convictions were predicated on conspiracy to \ncommit bank robbery, Hewitt moved the Fifth Circuit for \nauthorization to file a successive section 2255 habeas \npetition. Pet. App. 3a. The Fifth Circuit granted leave. \n\n10 \n \nIbid. The district court, in turn, vacated the conspiracy-\nbased section 924(c) convictions, vacated the sentence on \nthe \nremaining \nconvictions, \nand \nordered \nplenary \nresentencing. Ibid.  \n2. The case returned to the district court for de novo \nresentencing, but the new presentence report prepared in \nHewitt\u2019s case did not account for section 403(a)\u2019s inter-\nvening amendment of section 924(c). Pet. App. 3a-4a. \nHewitt thus objected to the report, arguing that section \n403(a) should apply. Ibid. The difference, he observed, \nwas substantial: Under the law in place at the time of his \noriginal sentencing, his minimum sentence for the re-\nmaining section 924(c) counts would be 105 years, still \neffectively a life sentence. Under section 403(a) of the \nFSA, the combined mandatory minimum is 25 years.  \nHewitt\u2019s co-defendants raised the same objections. \nAs to them, the government took the position that section \n403 was inapplicable on resentencing because the initial \nsentence for each had been imposed before the FSA\u2019s date \nof enactment. But by the time of Hewitt\u2019s resentencing, \nthe government had reversed its course and requested \napplication of section 403(a) at Hewitt\u2019s resentencing. \nSee Sentencing Tr., No. 3:08-cv-167, Dkt. 785 at 19:8-16 \n(N.D. Tex. Jan. 17, 2023). \nThe district court rejected Hewitt\u2019s and the \ngovernment\u2019s position. Id. at 22:18-23:5. The court \nreasoned that even when a sentence has been vacated, \n\u201cit\u2019s not vacated for purposes of the statute.\u201d Id. at \n22:25-23:1. It thus held that section 403(a) does not \napply and sentenced Hewitt to a 165-year term of im-\nprisonment, 105 of which corresponded to stacked \nsection 924(c) sentences. Pet. App. 5a; see Judgment on \nResentencing, No. 3:08-cv-167, Dkt. 780 (N.D. Tex. Nov. \n8, 2022).  \n\n11 \n \n3. The Fifth Circuit affirmed. See Pet. App. 1a-16a. \nBefore the court of appeals, Hewitt and the government \nagain both argued that section 403(a) should apply at \nresentencing following the judicial vacatur of a pre-FSA \nsentence. Pet. App. 7a. The Fifth Circuit nonetheless con-\ncluded that section 403(b) bars relief for Hewitt and his \ncodefendants. Pet. App. 6a. \nWhile the Fifth Circuit acknowledged that the phrase \n\u201chas not been imposed\u201d is an example of \u201cpresent-perfect \ntense,\u201d the court focused predominantly on the word \n\u201cimposed.\u201d Pet. App. 7a. It reasoned that whether a \nsentence has been imposed \u201cappears to hinge on a district \ncourt\u2019s action or inaction\u201d as a singular point in time, and \n\u201cnot on a defendant\u2019s status.\u201d Pet. App. 8a. It thus held \nthat section 403(b)\u2019s focus is on the one-time historical \nfact of a sentence\u2019s imposition. Ibid. Because Hewitt had \nbeen sentenced before the FSA\u2019s enactment as a matter of \nhistorical fact, it held relief under section 403(a) was \nunavailable. Ibid. \nThe court reasoned that \u201c[i]f Congress meant for the \nFirst Step Act\u2019s retroactivity bar to apply only to valid \nsentences, it could easily have said so.\u201d Pet. App. 8a. And \nit rejected Hewitt\u2019s arguments to the contrary, explaining \nthat \u201c[t]he mere observation that the statutory language \ncould be made clearer does not make it unclear in the first \nplace.\u201d Id. at 9a (quoting United States v. Jackson, 995 \nF.3d 522, 526 (6th Cir. 2021)). \nThe Fifth Circuit held further that \u201cvacatur has no \neffect\u201d on the outcome of the case. Pet. App. 9a. That \nconclusion was justified, the court explained, because \n\u201cotherwise, one who, as here, has been in prison for over \na decade serving later-vacated sentences would nonethe-\nless qualify\u201d for a more lenient sentence at resentencing \nunder the FSA. Pet. App. 9a-10a. The court referred to 18 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 3742(g), which requires use of the guidelines \n\u201cthat were in effect on the date of the previous sentencing \n\n12 \n \nof the defendant prior to the appeal\u201d for resentencing, \nwhich it characterized as giving continuing effect to \ninitial sentences that have been vacated. Id. at 10a. On \nthose grounds, the court affirmed. \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nPursuant to section 403(b) of the FSA, section 403(a) \napplies to a defendant who committed an offense and was \nconvicted and sentenced pre-enactment, but whose initial \nconviction and sentence have been vacated, necessitating \na post-enactment de novo resentencing.  \nA.1. The question here is whether Congress meant \u201ca \nsentence for the offense\u201d to include a sentence that was \npronounced before that date but later vacated. It could not \nhave done so. Congress drafts and enacts statutes against \nbackground legal principles, the content of which is \npresumptively incorporated into the meaning of the words \nit uses. As relevant here, the law treats a sentence that has \nbeen vacated as a nullity ab initio, as if it never existed. \nCases from before the Founding and consistently through \ntoday confirm that when an order or judgment is vacated, \nthe status quo ante is restored, and it is as though the order \nor judgment had never been made.  \nCongress is presumed to have known that settled \nlegal principle and, absent a contrary indication, to have \nincorporated it in the FSA. A sentence that has been \nvacated therefore cannot be \u201ca sentence for the offense,\u201d \nbecause a sentence that has been vacated does not exist. \nIt therefore cannot be ground to deny substantive relief at \nresentencing. \n2. Some lower courts have reasoned that to focus on \nthe invalidation ab initio of a vacated judgment is to add \nwords to section 403(b), effectively inserting the word \n\u201cvalid\u201d in front of the word \u201csentence.\u201d That reading has \nmatters backward. Again, the Court must presume that \nCongress incorporates settled legal principles into the \n\n13 \n \nstatutes it enacts. It therefore does not add words to the \nstatute to presume the word \u201csentence\u201d means a sentence \nthat has not been vacated. On the contrary, to read \u201ca \nsentence\u201d in section 403(b) to include a vacated sentence \nwould be to read it as \u201can initial sentence\u201d or \u201can original \nsentence.\u201d Such modifiers would be necessary to displace \nthe background rule that the law treats a sentence that \nhas been vacated as though it never existed. But Congress \ndid not include those words. \n3. Other courts have held that section 403(b) refers \nonly to the historical fact of a past pronouncement and \nthat a vacatur does not change the past. That is wrong \ntwice over. First, vacatur does change the past by opera-\ntion of law\u2014cases from time immemorial stand for the \nproposition that when an order is vacated, it as though the \nproceeding that produced the order never happened. That \nis why the Double Jeopardy Clause does not bar retrial \nafter a conviction is vacated on appeal. \nSecond, section 403(b) refers to the ongoing enforce-\nment of a sentence, not the fact of a past pronouncement. \nCongress\u2019s use of the present-perfect tense and the \npreposition \u201cas of\u201d confirm so. Use of the present-perfect \ntense implies concern with a time-span beginning in the \npast and extending up to now. And the preposition \u201cas of\u201d \nis used to indicate a time or date from which something \ncontinues. Together, they indicate that Congress was \nconcerned only with sentences that were pronounced pre-\nenactment and remain in force and effect today.  \nCommon English usage confirms the point. No one \nwould say that Hewitt\u2019s initial, since-vacated sentence \n\u201chas been imposed as of December 21, 2018,\u201d because it \nhas no continuing force or effect. If one wanted to refer to \nthe fact of a vacated sentence having been pronounced, \none would use the simple past tense and a preposition \nindicating a singular point in time: Hewitt\u2019s initial, since-\nvacated sentence was imposed before December 21, 2018. \n\n14 \n \nIndeed, Congress used just that formulation in section \n404, concerning sentencing modifications. That it did so \nthere but not in section 403(b) must be taken as inten-\ntional.  \n4. Statutory interpretation turns on ordinary, con-\ntemporary, and common use of the English language. \nThus, while rules of grammar and dictionary definitions \nare centrally important, the outcome cannot be \ndetermined by a single phrase scrutinized in the abstract. \nThe Court must look to the relevant language in its full \ncontext, with an eye to the statute\u2019s overall objective. \nOnly our interpretation is consistent with the FSA\u2019s \nbroader context, design, and purpose. Section 403(b) \nreflects a clear purpose: to make section 403(a)\u2019s amelior-\native sentencing reform available retroactively in pending \ncases while preserving the finality of valid criminal \njudgments. That line is sensible. Allowing application in \npending cases ensures that no court ever again engages in \nsentencing stacking, while at the same time respecting \nthe importance of the principle of finality to criminal \njustice and sound judicial administration. \nPlenary resentencings following full vacaturs are \n\u201cpending\u201d cases like any other; there is no sentence for \nthe defendant to serve, and a new one must be imposed by \nexercise of de novo judicial discretion. In that context, \napplication of section 403(a) would do nothing to disturb \nthe finality of an already-vacated judgment. Applying \nsection 403(a) to such cases is thus consistent with \nCongress\u2019s objective to foreclose stacking in pending \ncases while preserving the finality of past cases. \nThe opposite is true of the decision below. It draws an \narbitrary line between plenary sentencings and plenary \nresentencings, without any account for why Congress \nwould have intended such an irrational distinction. And \nin doing so, it ensures that prosecutors still may seek, and \n\n15 \n \ncourts still will be required to impose, stacked sentences \nin plenary sentencing proceedings into the future. That \ncannot be what Congress intended. \nB. The rule of lenity arises only if the Court concludes \nthat the statutory text is ambiguous, which the provision \nhere is not. But if the Court disagrees, it must resolve the \nambiguity in favor of Hewitt and the lesser sentence \nrequired under section 403(a). \nThe Court has repeatedly confirmed that the rule of \nlenity applies not only to statutes that define criminal \nliability, but also those that set the penalties for \nviolations. Under our interpretation of section 403(a), \nHewitt would face a mandatory minimum of 25 years. \nUnder the Fifth, Sixth, and Eleventh Circuit\u2019s mistaken \nconstruction, he would face a mandatory minimum of \nlonger than one century at his resentencing on the section \n924(c) counts alone. If there is any reasonable doubt \nabout the construction of section 403(a), it must be \nresolved in his favor. \nARGUMENT \n\u201cThe controlling principle in this case is the basic and \nunexceptional rule that courts must give effect to the \nclear meaning of statutes as written.\u201d Star Athletica, LLC \nv. Varsity Brands, Inc., 580 U.S. 405, 414 (2017) \n(quoting Estate of Coward v. Nicklos Drilling Co., 505 \nU.S. 469, 476 (1992)). When the statute\u2019s text is \u201cunam-\nbiguous,\u201d that \u201cfirst step of the interpretive inquiry\u201d is \nalso the \u201clast.\u201d Rotkiske v. Klemm, 589 U.S. 8, 13 (2019). \nTo interpret Congress\u2019s words, the Court must focus \non \u201cordinary, contemporary, [and] common\u201d use of the \nEnglish language. Star Athletica, 580 U.S. at 414. That \nmeans among other things the Court must give the text a \nreading that is consistent with and incorporates settled \nbackground legal principles, with which the public would \nexpect any words to comport. E.g., Cannon v. University \n\n16 \n \nof Chicago, 441 U.S. 677, 696-697 (1979) (explaining \nthat \u201c[i]t is always appropriate to assume that our elected \nrepresentatives, like other citizens, know the law\u201d). \nAnd while background principles, rules of grammar, \nand dictionary definitions are centrally important to the \ntask of statutory interpretation, the Court must \u201c\u2018con-\nsider not only the bare meaning\u2019 of the critical word or \nphrase \u2018but also its placement and purpose in the statu-\ntory scheme.\u2019\u201d Holloway v. United States, 526 U.S. 1, 6 \n(1999) (quoting Bailey v. United States, 516 U.S. 137, 145 \n(1995)). The only permissible meaning of a word or \nphrase is the one that fits with the statutory context and \npurpose, rather than conflicts with them. See, e.g., Dubin \nv. United States, 599 U.S. 110, 118-120 (2023). \nFirst, Congress did not intend the phrase \u201ca sentence \nfor the offense\u201d to include a vacated sentence. According \nto settled background principles, the law treats a vacated \nsentence as never having been pronounced. For a statute \nto override that principle requires a clear statement. \nThere is no such statement here.  \nSecond, the contrary rationales offered among the \nlower courts are unpersuasive. The rules of grammar, \nrelevant dictionary definitions, and statutory context all \nconfirm that Congress intended section 403(b) to \nauthorize section 403(a) relief in all pending cases, \nincluding cases that are pending de novo resentencing \nfollowing a vacatur. No other conclusion is consistent \nwith Congress\u2019s purpose or settled practice. And even if \nthere were doubt on that front (there should be none), it \nwould be resolved by the rule of lenity.  \nNo matter whether the Court finds the words clear or \nambiguous, a resentencing with the benefit of section \n403(a) is necessary. \n\n17 \n \nA. Section 403(a) applies to post-enactment \nde novo resentencings \nAll relevant considerations\u2014the text, context, and \npurpose of the FSA, the statute\u2019s design, and the back-\nground principles against which it was enacted\u2014confirm \nthat section 403(a) applies to plenary resentencings that \ntake place after the Act\u2019s enactment. \n1. A sentence that has been vacated is not \u201ca \nsentence for the offense\u201d \nThe central issue is whether Congress meant \u201ca \nsentence for the offense\u201d imposed \u201cas of\u201d December 21, \n2018, to include a sentence that was pronounced before \nthat date but later vacated. It did not. \na. One rule for reading \u201cstatutory text is recognizing \nthat Congress legislates against the backdrop of certain \nunexpressed presumptions.\u201d Bond v. United States, 572 \nU.S. 844, 857 (2014). Among those presumptions is that \n\u201cCongress is aware of existing law\u201d and, absent express \nindication otherwise, intends for the statutes it enacts to \ncomport with settled background legal principles and \nprecedents. See, e.g., Mississippi ex rel. Hood v. AU \nOptronics Corp., 571 U.S. 161, 169 (2014); accord \nCannon, 441 U.S. at 696-697. \nPut another way, the background principles against \nwhich Congress acts operate as default rules to which it \npresumptively intends for its enactments to conform. \nBecause the accepted legal backdrop will generally accord \nwith \u201cwidely held intuitions about how statutes ordin-\narily operate,\u201d a presumption that Congress means to \nincorporate background legal principles \u201cwill generally \ncoincide with legislative and public expectations.\u201d \nLandgraf v. USI Film Productions, 511 U.S. 244, 272 \n(1994). Cf. US Airways, Inc. v. McCutchen, 569 U.S. 88, \n102 (2013) (in a case concerning ERISA plan documents, \nrelying on the \u201cdefault rules [that] govern in the absence \n\n18 \n \nof a clear expression of [a] contrary intent\u201d); Staub v. \nProctor Hospital, 562 U.S. 411, 418 (2011) (in a federal \ntort case, observing that the Court must \u201cconsult general \nprinciples of law\u201d that \u201cform the background against \nwhich federal tort laws are enacted\u201d). \nb. Here, the settled legal background against which \nsection 403(b) was adopted demonstrates beyond debate \nthat Congress did not mean for \u201ca sentence\u201d to include a \nvacated sentence. Absent contrary intent, a vacated order \nis and always has been treated as though it was never \nentered in the first place\u2014it is a nullity, as though it never \nexisted. See United States v. Mitchell, 38 F.4th 382, 392 \n(3d Cir. 2022) (Bibas, J., concurring) (historical prin-\nciples \u201creveal that vacatur makes a sentence void from \nthe start\u201d). Nothing in section 403(b)\u2019s text overrides \nthat default understanding. \nTake first historical sources. At common law before \nthe Founding, vacatur on appeal made it \u201cas if no \n[judgment] had been\u201d entered, meaning in effect that \nthere was no \u201crecord of it.\u201d Ognell\u2019s Case (1592) 78 Eng. \nRep. 526, 526; 34 Cro. Eliz. 270, 271 (Q.B.); accord Eyre \nv. Woodfine (1592) 78 Eng. Rep. 533, 533; 34 Cro. Eliz. \n278, 278-279 (Q.B.). Countless other historical sources \nconfirm that when an order is vacated, it is \u201cin all respects \nas though the [order] had never been made.\u201d Norman v. \nNorman, 207 P. 970, 972 (Okla. 1922). Since time out of \nmind, courts have understood that vacatur \u201cputs the \nparties in the state, in which they were, immediately \nbefore the judgment was rendered,\u201d fully restoring the \nstatus quo ante. Lockwood v. Jones, 7 Conn. 431, 436 \n(1829). This Court summarized this principle more than \n150 years ago: \u201cvacating the former judgment * * * \nrender[s] it null and void, and the parties are left in the \nsame situation as if no trial had ever taken place in the \ncause.\u201d United States v. Ayres, 76 U.S. (9 Wall.) 608, 610 \n(1869).  \n\n19 \n \nA vacated order is not merely \u201csuspended\u201d on a \nforward-looking basis, while \u201cretain[ing] its vitality\u201d \nretrospectively. Stewart v. Oneal, 237 F. 897, 906 (6th \nCir. 1916). Rather, \u201cwhere an irregular order has been \nvacated it is held to be the same as though it never existed, \nand for that reason\u201d courts may not afford any \u201cprotec-\ntion to the acts which may have been performed under it.\u201d \nFarnsworth v. Western Union Telephone Co., 6 N.Y.S. \n735, 747 (Gen. Term 1889) (emphasis added). When \norders are vacated, it is \u201cas though they had never been \nmade or had\u201d in the first place. United States v. Mayse, 5 \nF.2d 885, 886 (9th Cir. 1925).2 \nThis ancient principle has been carried forward to \nmodern times without meaningful alteration. Like their \nforebears, cases since the midcentury onward confirm \nthat after a conviction is vacated, the defendant \u201cstand[s] \n \n2  Other historical examples expressing this principle are too many to \nlist. For a limited sample, see Williams v. Floyd, 27 N.C. 649, 656 \n(1845) (a void or \u201cstricken\u201d order is \u201cthe same as if the [order] had \nnever been made\u201d); Lawson v. Bissell, 7 Ohio St. 129, 132 (1857) \n(when a verdict and judgment are \u201cvacated\u201d it is \u201cas if there had been \nno trial\u201d); In re Lacey, 14 F. Cas. 906, 908 (C.C.D. Conn. 1874) \n(vacating an order allows the parties to act \u201cin the same way and \nmanner, and to the like effect\u201d as they could have had the order \n\u201cnever been made\u201d); Strickland v. Flagstaff Silver Mining Co., 1 Utah \n199, 204 (1875) (for purposes of post-judgment motions, a judgment \nthat is vacated \u201cwas as though it had never existed\u201d); Aultman v. \nSeiberling, 31 Ohio St. 201, 204 (1877) (when a decision is vacated, \nthe law and the facts are treated \u201cthe same as if no decision had been \nmade\u201d); Bondholders & Purchasers of the Iron Railroad v. Toledo, 62 \nF. 166, 168 (7th Cir. 1894) (after a court order vacating and annulling \na decree disallowing a claim, the claim was \u201cre-established in all \nrespects as fully as if [the vacated decree] had never been made\u201d); \nGreen v. McCarter, 42 S.E. 157, 158 (S.C. 1902) (when a judge \n\u201crevoke[s] his * * * order, the case [stands] just as if no order had been \nmade\u201d); In re Rochester Sanitarium & Baths Co., 222 F. 22, 26 (2d \nCir. 1915) (recognizing \u201c[t]he general rule\u201d that when a court vacates \nan order, \u201cit is the same as if such order had never existed\u201d). \n\n20 \n \nin the position of any man who was accused of a crime but \nhas not yet shown to have committed it.\u201d Fiswick v. \nUnited States, 329 U.S. 211, 223 (1946). \u201cThe general \nrule,\u201d according to these cases, \u201cis that when an order or \njudgment is vacated the previously existing status is \nrestored and the situation is the same as though the order \nor judgment had never been made.\u201d Wrang v. Spencer, \n235 A.2d 861, 863 (Conn. App. Ct. 1967). Nearly \nverbatim restatements of this universal principle appear \nin Mitchell v. Joseph, 117 F.2d 253, 255 (7th Cir. 1941); \nMiller v. Schlereth, 36 N.W.2d 497, 506 (Neb. 1949); \nTims v. Holland Furnace Co., 90 N.E.2d 376, 380 (Ohio \n1950); and Buchanan v. Cabiness, 245 S.W.2d 868, 873 \n(Mo. 1951) (en banc). \nThe notion that a vacated order is treated as though it \nhad never been entered in the first place reflects the same \nprinciple behind the Court\u2019s own Munsingwear doctrine: \nAn order vacating a judgment \u201celiminates [the] judg-\nment\u201d so that \u201cnone is prejudiced\u201d by it, \u201cclear[ing] the \npath for future relitigation of the issues between the \nparties.\u201d United States v. Munsingwear, 340 U.S. 36, 40 \n(1950). \u201cThe point of vacatur is to prevent\u201d its object \n\u201cfrom spawning any legal consequences, so that no party \nis harmed by\u201d it. Camreta v. Greene, 563 U.S. 692, 713 \n(2011) (citing Munsingwear). \nAnd the law not only treats the vacated judgment as \na nullity in its own right, but also regards the proceedings \nproducing it effectively as never having happened. Thus, \nfor example, the vacatur of a criminal judgment of convic-\ntion on appeal effectively erases from history the fact of \nthe jury\u2019s empanelment in the original trial, and thus in \nmost circumstances \u201cthere is no double jeopardy upon a \nnew trial.\u201d Burks v. United States, 437 U.S. 1, 12 (1978) \n(quoting Bryan v. United States, 338 U.S. 552, 560 \n(1950)). That rule \u201crests ultimately upon the premise that \nthe original conviction has, at the defendant\u2019s behest, \n\n21 \n \nbeen wholly nullified and the slate wiped clean.\u201d North \nCarolina v. Pearce, 395 U.S. 711, 721 (1969) (citing \nUnited States v. Ball, 163 U.S. 662 (1896)). \nThe same rationale applies with respect to senten-\ncing. As the Court made clear in Pepper v. United States, \n562 U.S. 476 (2011), when a court of appeals \u201cset[s] \naside [a defendant\u2019s] entire sentence and remand[s] for a \nde novo resentencing,\u201d all legal effect from the original \nsentencing proceeding is nullified, \u201ceffectively wip[ing] \nthe slate clean.\u201d Id. at 507. Rulings made at the original \nsentencing therefore have no continuing vitality under \nthe law-of-the-case doctrine. Ibid. \nc. The legal backdrop against which Congress en-\nacted the FSA is thus clear: When a criminal sentence is \nvacated, the status quo ante is restored as if the sentence \nhad never been pronounced. A sentence that has been \nvacated is a nullity; it is nothing; it never existed. See \nFiswick, 329 U.S. at 223.  \nThat resolves this case. Congress specified that \nsection 403(a)\u2019s sentencing reform shall apply \u201cif a \nsentence for the offense has not been imposed as of\u201d \nDecember 21, 2018. FSA \u00a7 403(b) (emphasis added). \nBecause a sentence that has been vacated is treated by \noperation of law as though it never was imposed\u2014so that \nit \u201cspawn[s no] legal consequences\u201d and \u201cno party is \nharmed by\u201d it (Camreta, 563 U.S. at 713 (quoting \nMunsingwear, 340 U.S. at 40-41))\u2014Congress could not \nhave intended for \u201ca sentence\u201d to include a vacated \nsentence. As a matter of law, an offender whose sentence \nhas been vacated is one for whom \u201ca sentence for the \noffense has not been imposed\u201d ever, including as of \nDecember 21, 2018.  \n\n22 \n \n2. Contrary opinions among the lower courts \nare not persuasive \na. In holding otherwise, the Fifth Circuit focused on \nthe indefinite article, \u201ca\u201d appearing before the word \n\u201csentence.\u201d See Pet. App. 8a-9a. The same argument was \nspelled out by then-Judge Barrett in her dissent in United \nStates v. Uriarte, 975 F.3d 596 (7th Cir. 2020) (en banc): \n\u201c[T]he indefinite article \u2018a\u2019 is broad enough,\u201d she argued, \n\u201cto refer to any sentence that has been imposed for the \noffense, even one that was subsequently vacated.\u201d Id. at \n608. In her and the Fifth Circuit\u2019s view, a pre-enactment \nsentence, even if later vacated, remains \u201ca sentence\u201d \nimposed \u201cas of\u201d December 21, 2018. Ibid.; Pet. App. 8a-\n9a; see also United States v. Hernandez, 107 F.4th 965, \n969 (11th Cir. 2024). \nRespectfully, that position disregards the nature of a \nvacatur and the default rule that it establishes. When \nCongress says \u201ca sentence\u201d without more, it cannot mean \na sentence that is treated by operation of law as never \nhaving been imposed. Otherwise, what would it mean for \nsomething to be treated as never having been imposed? \nThat conclusion does not add words to the statute, as \nthe Fifth Circuit implied. In the lower court\u2019s view, \u201c[i]f \nCongress meant for the First Step Act\u2019s retroactivity bar \nto apply only to valid sentences, it could easily have said \nso\u201d by specifying \u201ca valid sentence.\u201d Pet. App. 8a-9a. But \nthat misses the point, which is that an adjective like \n\u201cvalid\u201d would have been redundant given the background \nlegal principles against which Congress adopted the FSA. \nAgain, Congress is presumed to be aware of and \nincorporate those principles in the statues it enacts. And \nhere, the long-settled rule is that when an unlawful \u201corder \nhas been vacated it is held to be the same as though it \nnever existed\u201d and the law will \u201cafford no protection to \n\n23 \n \nthe acts which may have been performed under it.\u201d \nFarnsworth, 6 N.Y.S. at 747.  \nAccordingly, it is the Fifth Circuit\u2019s reading, not \npetitioner\u2019s, that would add words to the statute. To read \n\u201ca sentence\u201d as including a vacated sentence would be to \nread the statute as saying \u201can initial sentence\u201d or \u201can \noriginal sentence.\u201d Use of such adjectives would have \nreadily displaced the default rule that a vacated sentence \nis treated as a matter of law as never having existed. But \nCongress did not use those modifiers, and thus the \nassumption \u201cthat our elected representatives, like other \ncitizens, know the law\u201d when they draft and enact \nstatutes (Cannon, 441 U.S. at 696-697) carries the day \nfor Hewitt. \nb. Some lower courts have instead simply denied the \npremise of the argument, asserting that an order fully \nvacating a sentence \u201cdoes not require the district court to \nproceed as if the initial sentencing never happened.\u201d Pet. \nApp. 9a (quoting Uriarte, 975 F.3d at 608 (Barrett, J., \ndissenting)). For support, they have pointed to 18 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 3742(g)(1), which specifies that \u201ca district court \nimposing a sentence on remand\u201d following a vacatur on \nappeal \u201cmust apply the Sentencing Guidelines \u2018that were \nin effect on the date of the previous sentencing of the defen-\ndant prior to the appeal.\u2019\u201d Uriarte, 975 F.3d at 608 \n(Barrett, J., dissenting) (quoting section 3742(g)(1)). \nThat, we are told, is evidence that the effects of a vacated \nsentence are not wholly eliminated, and a court need not \n\u201cproceed as if the earlier sentencing never happened.\u201d \nUnited States v. Carpenter, 80 F.4th 790, 792 (6th Cir. \n2023) (Kethledge, J., concurring in the denial of rehear-\ning en banc). \nThat misunderstands what section 3742(g)(1) does. \nAs a starting point, the very relevance of the provision is \ndoubtful. It provides only that when a court of appeals \nremands a case for resentencing (plenary or otherwise), \n\n24 \n \nthe district court must utilize the sentencing guidelines \n\u201cthat were in effect on the date of the previous sen-\ntencing.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(g)(1). That shows only that \nCongress did not want changes to the guidelines to apply \nretroactively at resentencing. The statute\u2019s reference to \nthe state of the law on \u201cthe date of\u201d a prior proceeding \ndoes not suggest in any way that a vacated sentence itself \ncontinues to have legal force or effect.  \nMoreover, to the extent section 3742(g) has any rele-\nvance, it is only to confirm that Congress knows how to \nuse express language to override the default rule when it \nwishes to. Our point is not that a vacated sentence can \nnever have ongoing consequences\u2014it is only that, given \nthat Congress is assumed to understand that a vacated \nsentence is treated as if it were never entered, Congress \nwould have to use express language to accomplish that \nobjective. That is at most what section 3742(g) confirms: \nWhen Congress wants a vacated sentence to continue to \nhave some effect, it says so using a clear statement. Such \nlanguage is missing from section 403(b). \n3. Section 403(b) refers to the ongoing enforce-\nment of a sentence, not the fact of a past pro-\nnouncement \na. Other lower court opinions have rejected the rele-\nvance of vacatur by characterizing the imposition of a \nsentence as a historical fact that, if it occurred, cannot be \nerased from the documented past by a later vacatur of the \nsentence. According to this rationale, when Congress said \nthat section 403(a) shall apply to a pre-enactment offense \n\u201cif a sentence for the offense has not been imposed as of\u201d \nDecember 21, 2018 (FSA \u00a7 403(b)), it actually meant \u201cif \na sentence was not pronounced before\u201d that date.  \nThe Eleventh Circuit took this view in Hernandez. \nThere, it reasoned that section 403(b) \u201cis best read to \nrefer to a completed act\u201d because it conjugates the verb \n\n25 \n \n\u201cimposed,\u201d which \u201crefers to the historical fact of pro-\nnouncement\u201d taking place at \u201ca specific point in time.\u201d \nHernandez, 107 F.4th at 969-970; accord Pet. App. 7a-\n8a. Viewing the imposition of a sentence this way renders \neffect of vacatur irrelevant, according to these sources, \nbecause \u201cvacatur does not erase * * * from history\u201d the \nrecorded fact that a sentence was pronounced on a date \npreceding enactment. United States v. Jackson, 995 F.3d \n522, 525 (6th Cir. 2021). \nb. The problem with that approach is two-fold.  \nFirst, that is indeed precisely what an order of vacatur \ndoes\u2014by operation of law, it erases from history both the \nvacated order or judgment and the proceeding that \nproduced it. Thus, when a verdict and judgment are \n\u201cvacate[d],\u201d it is \u201cas if no trial had ever taken place in the \ncause.\u201d Ayres, 76 U.S. (9 Wall.) at 610; accord Lawson, \n7 Ohio St. at 132 (following a vacatur, the case must \nproceed \u201cas if there had been no trial\u201d).  \nAgain, that is the premise underlying the rule that \n\u201cthere is no double jeopardy upon a new trial\u201d following \na vacatur on appeal of the final judgment. Burks, 437 U.S. \nat 12. \u201cThere are few if any rules of criminal procedure \nclearer than the rule that \u2018jeopardy attaches when the jury \nis empaneled and sworn.\u2019\u201d Martinez v. Illinois, 572 U.S. \n833, 839 (2014) (quoting Crist v. Bretz, 437 U.S. 28, 35 \n(1978)). But when a conviction is later vacated, the law \ntreats the jury\u2019s empanelment at the first trial effectively \nas if it had never happened. Burks, 437 U.S. at 12.  \nApplied here, that means that no legal disability may \nfollow from Hewitt\u2019s sentence ever having existed, \nincluding any disability following from the historical fact \nof the pronouncement having taken place. \nSecond, the historical-fact approach to section 403(b) \nis inconsistent with the verb tense and preposition that \nCongress used there. If Congress had meant the applic-\n\n26 \n \nability of section 403(a) to turn on whether a district \njudge had pronounced a sentence on a date preceding \nDecember 21, 2018, as a simple matter of historical fact, \nit would not have used the present-perfect tense or the \npreposition \u201cas of.\u201d Instead, it would have used the \nsimple past tense, together with a preposition such as \nbefore or prior to\u2014it would have said section 403(a) shall \napply to a pre-enactment offense \u201cif a sentence for the \noffense was imposed before such date of enactment.\u201d That \nword choice would have been consistent with the House \nLegislative Drafting Manual, which directs drafters of \nlegislation to use the past tense to refer to \u201cfacts that \nmust precede\u201d the statute\u2019s \u201coperation.\u201d House Legisla-\ntive Counsel\u2019s Manual on Drafting Style, HLC No. 104-1, \n\u00a7 351(f)(2), at 60 (1995). \nBut that is not the formulation that Congress chose. \nInstead, it used the present-perfect tense, together with \nthe preposition \u201cas of.\u201d Each alone\u2014and undeniably both \ntogether\u2014connote an ongoing condition rather than the \noccurrence of a singular past event.  \nThe relevant grammar rules make this clear. The \npresent-perfect tense uses the words \u201chas been\u201d (or in \nthis case \u201chas not been\u201d). Whereas the past tense \u201cis a \nsimple tense, just past,\u201d the present perfect \u201cis a com-\npound tense combining past and present.\u201d Rodney Hud-\ndleston & Geoffrey K. Pullum, The Cambridge Grammar \nof the English Language 142 (2002) (hereinafter \nCambridge Grammar). That is to say, the present perfect \n\u201cinvolves reference to both past and present time\u201d and \n\u201cis concerned with a time-span beginning in the past and \nextending up to now.\u201d Id. at 143 (emphasis added). Thus, \nin contrast with the past tense, which focuses on a \nsingular past occurrence, \u201cthe primary focus\u201d of the \npresent-perfect \u201cis on the present.\u201d Ibid. It accordingly \n\u201cis not used in contexts where the \u2018now\u2019 component of \n[the time span] is explicitly or implicitly excluded,\u201d such \n\n27 \n \nas when one is speaking about a discrete past event that \nhas concluded. Ibid. \nThat alone forecloses Hernandez\u2019s past-historical-\nfact rationale. If one says that a sentence \u201chas been im-\nposed as of\u201d some past date, it indicates that the sentence \nwas in effect on that date and is still being enforced today, \n\u201cextending up to now.\u201d Cambridge Grammar 143. It \nindicates, in other words, that the sentence remains final \nand in force at the time of speaking, and that it has not \nbeen vacated by a court. 3 \nThat conclusion follows not only from the use of the \npresent-perfect tense, but also from the preposition \u201cas \nof,\u201d which indicates a time or date \u201cfrom\u201d which some-\nthing begins or continues. See Collins English Dictionary \n113 (14th ed. 2023) (hereinafter Collins). One would say, \nfor example, that a contract is effective \u201cas of\u201d the date it \ncomes into force. In doing so, one would indicate the \ncommencement of a continuous period of enforcement\u2014\nthe effective date and onward. And if one were to combine \n\u201cas of\u201d with the present-perfect tense (stating that a \ncontract \u201chas been effective as of December 21, 2018\u201d), \nthe plain meaning would be that the contract was en-\nforceable on that date and remains so now. In contrast, it \nwould be incoherent to say that a contract \u201chas been \neffective as of December 21, 2018,\u201d if, at the time of \nspeaking, the contract was terminated by the parties or \nvoided by a court.3 \n \n3  It bears noting \u201cthe widely accepted modern legislative drafting \nconvention that a law should not be read to speak as of the date of \nenactment,\u201d but \u201c\u2018as of any date on which it is read.\u2019\u201d Carr v. United \nStates, 560 U.S. 438, 463 (2010) (Alito, J., dissenting) (quoting \nSenate Office of the Legislative Counsel, Legislative Drafting \nManual \u00a7 103(a), at 4 (1997)). This convention recognizes that most \nlaws \u201chave a continuing effect in that they apply over time,\u201d and they \nthus \u201cspeak at the time of reading, not merely at the time of their \nadoption.\u201d Id. at 464.  \n\n28 \n \nThe same goes for section 403(b). Congress specified \nthat section 403(a) shall apply to a pre-enactment offense \n\u201cif a sentence for the offense has not been imposed as of\u201d \nDecember 21, 2018. The inverse is that section 403(a) \nshall not apply to a pre-enactment offense \u201cif a sentence \nfor the offense has been imposed as of\u201d that date. But it \nwould be ungrammatical to say that Hewitt is a defendant \non whom \u201ca sentence has been imposed as of\u201d December \n21, 2018, because that formulation mistakenly implies \nthat at the time of speaking, there is a present, ongoing \nenforcement of his sentence. \nOne might say that Hewitt\u2019s initial sentence was \nimposed before that date. But, again, those are not the \nwords Congress used. And \u201ccourts must presume that a \nlegislature says in a statute what it means and means in a \nstatute what it says there.\u201d Connecticut National Bank v. \nGermain, 503 U.S. 249, 253-254 (1992). \nc. Use of the word \u201cimposed\u201d does not change mat-\nters. To be sure, \u201cimposed,\u201d viewed in isolation, can be \ntaken to mean \u201cto establish as something to be obeyed or \ncomplied with.\u201d Collins 984; see also Webster\u2019s Third \nNew International Dictionary 1136 (2002) (hereinafter \nWebster\u2019s) (defining impose as, among other things, \n\u201cbestow\u201d). On that meaning, a judge who imposes a \nsentence establishes it or bestows it on the defendant as a \nmatter of fact at a singular point in time.  \nBut the word can also mean to \u201cenforce\u201d (Collins \n984) or to \u201capply,\u201d as in a \u201cpenalty\u201d (Webster\u2019s 1136). \nUnderstood in that way, the word means an ongoing \ncondition of enforcement: A sentence is imposed on (it is \napplied to or enforced against) an offender during the \nentire duration of his or her incarceration. This meaning \nsuggests not a singular past occurrence that took place at \na particular point in time, but rather an ongoing condition: \nA \u201csentence remains \u2018imposed\u2019\u201d until it is \u201cvacate[d].\u201d \n\n29 \n \nUnited States v. Henry, 983 F.3d 214, 223 (6th Cir. \n2020). \nThe academic possibility of these two meanings does \nnot render section 403(b) ambiguous. The proper interp-\nretation of \u201cwords that can have more than one meaning\u201d \nare generally resolved \u201cby their surroundings.\u201d Arizona \nv. Inter Tribal Council of Arizona, 570 U.S. 1, 10 (2013) \n(quoting Whitman v. American Trucking Associations, \n531 U.S. 457, 466 (2001)). That is, the \u201csusceptibility\u201d \nof a singular word to multiple meanings does not neces-\nsarily render the word ambiguous, because \u201call but one of \nthe meanings is ordinarily eliminated by context.\u201d Deal v. \nUnited States, 508 U.S. 129, 131-132 (1993). \nJust so here. By using the present-perfect tense \n(rather than the past tense) and the preposition \u201cas of\u201d \n(rather than \u201cbefore\u201d or \u201cprior to\u201d) Congress signaled its \nfocus on a \u201ctime-span beginning in the past and extending \nup to now.\u201d Cambridge Grammar 143. Any contention \nthat the word \u201cimposed\u201d in section 403(b) \u201crefers to the \nhistorical fact of pronouncement\u201d at \u201ca specific point in \ntime\u201d (Hernandez, 107 F.4th at 970) rather than a \ncondition of ongoing enforcement would require reform-\ning the tense and replacing the preposition that Congress \nused. The law permits no such revisions. \nd. Moreover, section 404 of the FSA demonstrates \nthat Congress was aware of and intended the difference. \nThere, Congress provided for motions to reduce valid, \nfinal sentences in limited circumstances. See generally \nConcepcion v. United States, 597 U.S. 481 (2022). In \ndoing so, Congress limited relief in two notable ways. \nFirst, it specified in section 404(c) that \u201c[n]o court shall \nentertain a motion made under this section to reduce a \nsentence if the sentence was previously imposed or \npreviously reduced\u201d under certain circumstances. FSA \n\u00a7 404(c), Pet. App. 21a. If the lower court were correct \nthat Congress intended in section 403(b) to refer to a \n\n30 \n \nsingular past event (the pronouncement of a sentence \nbefore enactment), it presumably would have used the \nsame formulation\u2014section 403(a) shall apply to pre-\nenactment offenses \u201cif no sentence for the offense was \npreviously imposed.\u201d It did not do so. \n Second, also in section 404(c), Congress foreclosed \nrelief if a motion \u201cto reduce the sentence was, after the \ndate of enactment of this Act, denied after a complete \nreview of the motion on the merits.\u201d Again, if the lower \ncourt\u2019s reading were correct, Congress could have used \nthat alternative formulation in section 403(b)\u2014section \n403(a) shall apply to pre-enactment offenses \u201cif no \nsentence for the offense was imposed before said date of \nenactment.\u201d Again, it did not do so. \nBoth examples demonstrate that Congress knows \nhow to use the simple past tense to denote discrete events \ntaking place at fixed times in the past when it wishes to. \nIt did so in section 404(c), but it did not do so in section \n403(b). And the Court \u201cgenerally presum[es] that Con-\ngress acts intentionally and purposely when it includes \nparticular language in one section of a statute but omits it \nin another.\u201d Intel Corp. Investment Policy Committee v. \nSulyma, 589 U.S. 178, 186 (2020) (quoting BFP v. Res-\nolution Trust Corporation, 511 U.S. 531, 537 (1994)).  \nAll of this leads to a straightforward conclusion: \nWhen Congress said that section 403(a) shall apply to a \npre-enactment offense \u201cif a sentence for the offense has \nnot been imposed as of\u201d December 21, 2018 (FSA \n\u00a7 403(b), Pet. App. 20a), it meant a sentence that was \nbeing enforced \u201cas of\u201d that date and is still being enforced \nat the relevant time of reading. And needless to say, that \ndoes not describe a sentence vacated before the reading.  \n\n31 \n \n4. Purpose and practice confirm that section \n403(a) applies to plenary resentencings \na. Purpose and practice confirm the Fifth Circuit\u2019s \nerror in this case. Statutory interpretation turns on the \nway that ordinary English speakers use language. The \nCourt thus has a long history of reading statutory words \nand phrases \u201cnot in a vacuum, but with reference to the \nstatutory context, \u2018structure, history, and purpose,\u2019\u201d \n\u201cnot to mention common sense.\u201d Abramski v. United \nStates, 573 U.S. 169, 179 (2014) (quoting Maracich v. \nSpears, 570 U.S. 48, 76 (2013)). While rules of grammar, \ndictionary definitions, and background legal principles \nare of course matters of central importance, the Court \n\u201cmust not be guided by a single sentence or member of a \nsentence\u201d studied in the academic abstract; it must \ninstead \u201clook to the provisions of the whole law, and to \nits object and policy.\u201d Kelly v. Robinson, 479 U.S. 36, 43 \n(1986) (quoting Offshore Logistics, Inc. v. Tallentire, 477 \nU.S. 207, 221 (1986)).  \nAlthough broader in total effect, the FSA\u2019s \u201cmost \nimportant reforms\u201d were the \u201cchanges to mandatory \nminimums\u201d at issue here. 164 Cong. Rec. S7748 (daily \ned. Dec. 18, 2018) (statement of Sen. Klobuchar). Moved \nby heartless examples of excessive imprisonment, Con-\ngress set out to \u201celiminate[] the so-called stacking pro-\nvision in the U.S. Code\u201d and to \u201censure that sentencing \nenhancements for repeat offenses apply only to true \nrepeat offenders.\u201d Id. at S7774 (statement of Sen. \nCardin); accord 164 Cong. Rec. H10362 (daily ed. Dec. \n20, 2018) (statement of Rep. Nadler). Courts on both \nsides of the issue have thus concluded that the FSA\u2019s \npurpose \u201cis obvious: to reduce the harsh length of sen-\ntences for * * * certain firearms offenses.\u201d Mitchell, 38 \nF.4th at 387. It was, in other words, \u201cto ensure that the \nlengthy mandatory-minimum sentences for stacked \n\n32 \n \n\u00a7 924(c) convictions ended, whether at initial senten-\ncings or resentencings.\u201d Henry, 983 F.3d at 224.  \nTo that end, Congress made section 403(a) applicable \nnot only to post-enactment crimes, but also pre-enact-\nment ones. In doing so, it had two options: First, it could \nmake section 403(a) retroactively applicable to all \ndefendants serving stacked sentences, including those \nsubject to valid final judgments. Second, it could make \nsection 403(a) retroactively applicable to crimes com-\nmitted pre-enactment, but only in pending, non-final \ncases.  \nThe choice required a balance of competing values of \nthe highest order. On the one hand, Congress was deeply \nconcerned that defendants were serving unduly harsh and \noverlong sentences. Few government interventions have \nthe same impact and gravity as deprivation of liberty by \nimprisonment. On the other hand, there is a \u201cstrong \ninterest in preserving the finality of judgments.\u201d Harris \nv. Rivera, 454 U.S. 339, 348 n.21 (1981) (quoting Hen-\nderson v. Kibbe, 431 U.S. 145, 154 n.13 (1977)). \nLegislators understand that \u201c[f]inality is essential to both \nthe retributive and the deterrent functions of criminal \nlaw.\u201d Calderon v. Thompson, 523 U.S. 538, 555 (1998). \nAnd finality serves the public\u2019s interest in efficient \njudicial administration, increases confidence in the \njustice system, and fosters the public interest in repose. \nEvidently with these latter principles in mind, Con-\ngress selected the second option: It made section 403(a) \nrelief available to defendants whose criminal conduct \npredated enactment of the statute, but whose cases were \n\u201cpending\u201d (that is, those whose sentence \u201chas not been \n\n33 \n \nimposed as of\u201d the FSA\u2019s enactment). See FSA \u00a7 403(b) \n(titled \u201cApplicability to Pending Cases\u201d).4 \nIn taking this approach, \u201cCongress stanched, to the \ndegree that it could,\u201d the problem of sentence stacking, \nbut \u201cwithout overturning valid and settled sentences.\u201d \nUriarte, 975 F.3d at 601. \u201cIn choosing not to write \n\u00a7 403(b) to allow reductions to valid sentences that al-\nready had been imposed, Congress expressed a policy \npreference in favor of settled expectations and ease of \nadministration.\u201d Id. at 605; see also United States v. \nMerrell, 37 F.4th 571, 576 (9th Cir. 2022) (\u201c[W]e find it \nclear that \u00a7 403(b) was intended to ensure that the \nadoption of the First Step Act by itself would not affect \nany sentence previously imposed.\u201d); Henry, 983 F.3d at \n225 (\u201cCongress chose not to disrupt the finality of past \nsentences \n* * * \nfor \ndefendants \nserving \nstacked \nsentences.\u201d).  \nWhat is more, Congress \u201cnaturally wanted to reach \nall cases where there was not already a sentence in place.\u201d \nUriarte, 975 F.3d at 605. It intended to give defendants \nthe benefit of section 403(a) at all future plenary \nsentencing proceedings, without disturbing the sentences \nvalidly imposed in past proceedings. \nb. Applying section 403(a) to defendants like Hewitt \nis consistent with Congress\u2019s policy choice. The lower \ncourt\u2019s contrary decision is not. \nOnce a court vacates a criminal sentence and orders a \nde novo resentencing, there can no longer be any interest \n \n4  \u201cThis Court has long considered that the title of a statute and the \nheading of a section are tools available for the resolution of a doubt \nabout the meaning of\u201d a statutory provision. Dubin, 599 U.S. at 120-\n121 (cleaned up). A section title cannot \u201coverride\u201d the words that \nfollow, but Congress\u2019s words \u201cmust be construed in light of the terms \nsurrounding them, and the title Congress chose is among those \nterms.\u201d Id. at 121 (cleaned up).  \n\n34 \n \nin finality. See Pepper, 562 U.S. at 507. Because the \ndistrict court must resentence the defendant \u201cas if no \ninitial sentencing ever occurred\u201d (United States v. Burke, \n863 F.3d 1355, 1359 (11th Cir. 2017)), finality is already \nout the window by the time the district court undertakes \na de novo resentencing following a vacatur. The initial \nsentence is gone, and a brand new sentence must be deter-\nmined and pronounced. \nPractice bears this out. A plenary resentencing is a de \nnovo proceeding, and the district court must exercise its \ndiscretion anew in setting an appropriate sentence. \u201c[A]t \nany subsequent resentencing after a sentence has been set \naside,\u201d the court must determine a sentence \u201cbased on \nappropriate consideration of all of the factors listed in \n\u00a7 3553(a),\u201d without regard for prior rulings from the \ninitial sentencing. Pepper, 562 U.S. at 490. Among other \nthings, the probation officer must prepare a new \npresentence report (see Pet. App. 3a-4a; Dkt. 785, at 15), \nthe parties must submit new objections and responses \n(Dkts. 694, 699), and the court must hold a new hearing \nand consider and resolve the disagreements. See Concep-\ncion, 597 U.S. at 484.  \nThere is no conceivable reason that Congress would \nhave wanted district courts to continue imposing \u201cirra-\ntional, inhumane, and absurd\u201d sentences pursuant to a \n\u201ccruel and unjust\u201d sentencing rule (Hungerford, 465 \nF.3d at 1118 (Reinhardt, J., concurring)) that it had just \nrepealed retroactively for all pending cases. On the \ncontrary, lawmakers \u201cwanted the unfair practice\u201d of \nstacking \u201cstopped upon enactment\u201d (Uriarte, 975 F.3d at \n603) because they \u201crecognized that such lengthy sen-\ntences * * * were draconian and sought to end the \npractice\u201d (Henry, 983 F.3d at 225).  \nNo court and no party in any case presenting this \nissue has identified any reason why Congress would have \nintended for courts to continue to impose since-repu-\n\n35 \n \ndiated stacking rules in plenary resentencings. Simply \nput, there is none. Given \u201cthat Congress had determined \nthat the earlier sentencing structure resulted in sentences \nthat were too long and unfair,\u201d its goal was to \u201censur[e] \nthat those sentences would not be imposed on defendants \nyet to be sentenced,\u201d for whatever reason. Uriarte, 975 \nF.3d at 603. The Court is not required to turn a blind eye \nto that purpose, adopting an interpretation that does \nviolence to it rather than respecting it. \nB. Any ambiguity must be resolved in favor of \napplying section 403(a) to Hewitt \nIf, after all, there were any doubt about section \n403(b)\u2019s proper interpretation, the rule of lenity would \nrequire the Court to resolve it in Hewitt\u2019s favor. A penal \nstatute cannot be construed to impose a 105-year \nmandatory minimum sentence when another plausible \nreading would produce a 25-year mandatory minimum. \nNo matter the Court\u2019s view of the interpretations adopted \nby the Fifth, Sixth, and Eleventh Circuits, Hewitt\u2019s inter-\npretation is at the very least a plausible one. The rule of \nlenity thus requires the Court to adopt it.  \n1. The rule of lenity is an interpretive canon \u201cnot \nmuch less old than [statutory] construction itself.\u201d \nUnited States v. Wiltberger, 18 U.S. (5 Wheat.) 76, 95 \n(1820) (Marshall, C.J.). It demands that \u201cambiguity \nconcerning the ambit of criminal statutes should be \nresolved in favor of lenity.\u201d Skilling v. United States, 561 \nU.S. 358, 410 (2010) (quoting Cleveland v. United States, \n531 U.S. 12, 25 (2000)). It \u201capplies not only to \ninterpretations of the substantive ambit of criminal \nprohibitions, but also to the penalties they impose.\u201d \nBifulco v. United States, 447 U.S. 381, 387 (1980). \nSimply stated, \u201c[i]n the construction of a penal statute, it \nis well settled *\u202f*\u202f* that all reasonable doubts concerning \n\n36 \n \nits meaning ought to operate in favor of [the defendant].\u201d \nHarrison v. Vose, 50 U.S. (9 How.) 372, 378 (1850).  \nThe rule is grounded in the Constitution. It ensures \n\u201cthat the power of punishment is vested in the legislative, \nnot in the judicial department,\u201d for it is \u201cthe legislature, \nnot the Court, which is to define a crime, and ordain its \npunishment.\u201d Wiltberger, 18 U.S. (5 Wheat.) at 95; see \nalso Wooden v. United States, 595 U.S. 360, 388-392 \n(2022) (Gorsuch, J., concurring) (describing the due-\nprocess and separation-of-powers underpinnings).  \nThe rule of lenity applies when the ordinary tools of \nconstruction (\u201ctext, structure, and history\u201d) \u201cfail to \nestablish that\u201d the harsher reading is \u201cunambiguously \ncorrect.\u201d United States v. Granderson, 511 U.S. 39, 54 \n(1994). Lenity applies \u201cwhen, after consulting traditional \ncanons of statutory construction, [the Court is] left with \nan ambiguous statute.\u201d Shular v. United States, 589 U.S. \n154, 165 (2020) (quoting United States v. Shabani, 513 \nU.S. 10, 17 (1994)); see also Wooden, 595 U.S. at 392-\n393 (Gorsuch, J., concurring).  \n2. As we demonstrated in the preceding parts of this \nbrief, section 403(b) states plainly that Hewitt\u2019s plenary \nresentencing shall be subject to section 403(a). That is \nthe only reading consistent with the background rules \nagainst which Congress enacted the FSA, as well as the \nrelevant rules of grammar, the definitions of the terms \nused, the structure and scheme of the statute, and \nCongress\u2019s manifest purpose. \nIf for any reason the Court concludes that the lower \ncourt\u2019s alternative interpretation is a possible one, the \nrule of lenity would dictate that the ambiguity be resolved \nin Hewitt\u2019s favor. Indeed, this is a textbook case for \napplication of lenity. Defendants like Hewitt who are \nresentenced will receive drastically lower sentences \nunder our interpretation than they would under the Fifth, \n\n37 \n \nSixth, and Eleventh Circuits\u2019 construction. \u201c[L]enity \nmeans that the Court will not interpret a federal criminal \nstatute so as to increase the penalty that it places on an \nindividual when such an interpretation can be based on no \nmore than a guess as to what Congress intended.\u201d Bifulco, \n447 U.S. at 387 (quoting Ladner v. United States, 358 \nU.S. 169, 178 (1958)). To adopt the Fifth, Sixth, and \nEleventh Circuit\u2019s reading would mean making just such \na guess.  \nIf, after applying all the textual rules of construction, \nthe Court sees no one clear answer, then lenity requires \nreversal. Granderson proves the point. There, as here, the \nCourt addressed a question of statutory interpretation \nconcerning sentencing. 511 U.S. at 41. The practical \ndifference between the principal options was a mandatory \n20-month sentence (if the government was correct) or a \nmandatory two-month sentence (if the defendant was \ncorrect). Id. at 41-42. After evaluating the \u201ctext, \nstructure, and history\u201d and finding no clear answer, the \nCourt \u201cappl[ied] the rule of lenity and resolve[d] the \nambiguity in [the defendant\u2019s] favor.\u201d Id. at 54.  \nThe same process is required here. There is no \nquestion that Hewitt must be resentenced. Under our \ninterpretation of section 403(a), he would face a \nmandatory minimum of 25 years. Under the Fifth, Sixth, \nand Eleventh Circuits\u2019 construction, he would face a \nmandatory minimum of longer than 100 years at his \nresentencing. Were there any \u201creasonable doubt\u201d about \nthe construction of section 403(a), that doubt \u201cshould be \nresolved in favor of\u201d Hewitt. Wooden, 595 U.S. at 397 \n(Gorsuch, J., concurring). \n \n \n\n38 \n \nCONCLUSION \nThe Court should reverse and remand with instruc-\ntions to resentence Hewitt under section 403(a). \nRespectfully submitted. \nEugene R.

          "task_beliefs": "My understanding of this case is becoming increasingly robust on the petitioner's side, though a critical gap remains. My prior belief in the strength of the petitioner's multi-pronged argument\u2014based on the textual \"nullity\" principle of a vacated sentence, grammatical tense, Congressional purpose, the structural need for *de novo* resentencing under current law, and the rule of lenity\u2014remains the foundation of my model. The government's confession of error continues to be a significant signal favoring the petitioner.\n\nThe latest observation, a search for the opposing arguments, did not yield the intended document. I have not yet found the brief from a court-appointed *amicus curiae* defending the Fifth Circuit's judgment. This means the core uncertainty I previously identified\u2014the specific legal reasoning that has persuaded multiple circuit courts\u2014persists. My model of the adversarial debate is still incomplete on one side.\n\nHowever, the search unexpectedly uncovered a highly valuable *amicus* brief from the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers (NACDL) *in support of the petitioner*. This observation enriches my understanding in two key ways:\n1.  **Reinforcement of Purposive Arguments:** The NACDL, a major bar association, strongly reinforces the purposive argument that the First Step Act (FSA) was a landmark, bipartisan effort to correct \"draconian\" and \"overzealous\" sentencing practices. Their support adds institutional weight to the petitioner's position.\n2.  **Introduction of a \"Scope-Widening\" Argument:** Crucially, the NACDL brief introduces a new and powerful structural argument that I had not previously considered. It argues that the applicability clause at issue, \u00a7 403(b), uses functionally identical language to the clause in \u00a7 401(c), which governs sentencing reforms for drug offenses. Therefore, the Court's ruling in *Hewitt* will not only decide the fate of \u00a7 924(c) sentence stacking but will also create binding precedent for the application of the FSA's drug sentencing reforms to defendants resentenced after the Act's passage.\n    *   **Significance:** This raises the stakes of the case considerably. The NACDL points out that drug offenders are the single largest category of federal prisoners. By linking the two sections, the brief frames the case as a pivotal decision for the consistent implementation of Congress's entire sentencing reform package, not just a niche firearms provision. This may influence justices concerned with the coherence and broad impact of the statutory scheme.\n\nMy prediction continues to lean in favor of the petitioner, and this new information slightly increases my confidence in that direction. However, the inability to find and analyze the counterarguments remains the most significant source of uncertainty. My immediate goal is to locate the brief defending the judgment below to build a complete model of the legal dispute.",
          "design_beliefs": "This observation has provided critical feedback on my research methodology, validating some principles while forcing the refinement and creation of others.\n\n**Core Principles (Validated and Deepened):**\n1.  **Problem Decomposition:** This remains my foundational strategy. My systematic approach of modeling the petitioner's side first and then actively seeking the respondent's (or in this case, the *amicus*-as-respondent's) side is proving effective at managing complexity and identifying known unknowns.\n2.  **Primary Source Prioritization:** This principle is strongly reinforced and expanded. The NACDL *amicus* brief demonstrates that non-party briefs are not merely supplementary; they can be high-value primary sources that introduce novel, case-altering legal arguments (like the \u00a7 401 link) and crucial empirical context (the Sentencing Commission data). They must be analyzed with the same rigor as party briefs.\n3.  **Identify High-Value Signals:** My understanding of the Solicitor General's \"confession of error\" as a trigger for a court-appointed *amicus* remains a key insight. The failure to find that *amicus* brief makes its eventual discovery even more critical.\n4.  **Contextualize with Judicial Behavior:** The NACDL's argument, which blends purpose, statutory structure, and real-world consequences, further validates the idea that the most effective arguments appeal to a range of judicial philosophies.\n\n**New and Refined Heuristics:**\n*   **Argumentative Synergy:** The petitioner's case now appears even more synergistic, weaving together text, purpose, precedent, and now, a broader structural argument about the entire FSA.\n*   **The \"Legal Nullity\" Heuristic:** This remains a key principle to watch for in cases involving vacated judgments.\n*   **Strategic Information Sequencing:** The strategy of analyzing the petitioner's brief and then seeking the counter-argument is confirmed as efficient. The failure was not in the strategy, but in the tactical execution of the search.\n*   **Model the Adversarial Process (Reinforced):** This observation powerfully underscores the importance of this heuristic. My model is currently unbalanced, rich with pro-petitioner arguments but empty of counterarguments. This highlights the risk of confirmation bias and the absolute necessity of finding the opposing brief to accurately model the intellectual challenge the Court faces.\n*   **Flexible Search Strategy (New Heuristic):** My previous search query was too specific and failed. This reveals a methodological flaw. Future searches on dockets must be more flexible. A better approach would be to start with broader keywords (e.g., \"amicus\") and manually filter, or to search for the court order that *appoints* an *amicus* to identify them by name. I must adapt my search tactics when a precise query yields no results.\n*   **The \"Scope-Widening\" Heuristic (New Heuristic):** The NACDL brief provides a perfect example of a powerful legal tactic: reframing a seemingly narrow legal question by linking it to other statutory provisions or broader principles, thereby increasing the case's perceived importance. I will now actively look for these \"scope-widening\" arguments in *amicus* briefs, as they can fundamentally alter the context and consequences of a Supreme Court decision."

          "task_beliefs": "My model of this case has taken a significant step from identifying a \"known unknown\" to having a clear path to resolving it. The core uncertainty\u2014the specific legal arguments defending the Fifth Circuit's judgment\u2014still exists, but I have now identified its source.\n\nThe latest search, while not returning the court-appointed *amicus* brief directly, was highly successful in a different way. It returned a \"Certificate of Service\" filed by the petitioner's counsel. This procedural document has provided a critical piece of intelligence: the court-appointed *amicus curiae* defending the judgment below is **Michael Hugh McGinley of Dechert LLP**. My model is no longer missing a nameless, faceless counterargument; it is missing a specific brief from a known author, which makes my next information-gathering step highly targeted.\n\nThis observation also yielded the petitioner's full merits brief. A review of its summary and structure confirms that my existing model of the petitioner's case is accurate and robust. The arguments I had previously identified are all present and central:\n1.  **Textual/Historical (\"Legal Nullity\"):** The brief's primary argument is that a vacated sentence is a legal nullity, treated as if it never existed. It supports this with a deep dive into common law history, citing cases from as far back as the 16th century, adding significant weight to this textualist-historical claim.\n2.  **Grammatical:** It argues the statute's use of the present-perfect tense (\"has not been imposed\") combined with the preposition \"as of\" refers to a sentence's ongoing legal status, not a historical event. A vacated sentence has no ongoing status.\n3.  **Structural/Purposive:** It frames the issue around finality. Congress intended to respect final judgments, but a case where a sentence has been vacated is, by definition, not final and is pending for a *de novo* resentencing.\n4.  **Rule of Lenity:** This is presented as a fallback argument to resolve any remaining ambiguity in the petitioner's favor.\n\nThe government's confession of error and the NACDL's \"scope-widening\" argument (linking \u00a7 403 to the FSA's drug sentencing reforms in \u00a7 401) remain powerful factors favoring the petitioner. My confidence in a pro-petitioner ruling is solid, but it cannot increase further until I successfully model the counterarguments from Mr. McGinley's brief. The central task is now to acquire and analyze that specific document.",
          "design_beliefs": "This observation provides powerful validation for several evolving methodological principles and introduces a crucial new one. My framework for legal analysis is becoming more sophisticated.\n\n**Core Principles (Validated and Deepened):**\n1.  **Problem Decomposition:** This remains the bedrock of my approach. The strategy of modeling one side, identifying the gap, and then seeking the counterargument is working perfectly.\n2.  **Primary Source Prioritization:** Reinforced. Having the petitioner's actual merits brief confirms my understanding derived from secondary sources and other briefs, serving as the ultimate ground truth for that side of the argument.\n3.  **Identify High-Value Signals:** The government's confession of error remains a key signal, and the failure to find the resulting *amicus* brief correctly identified it as the most important missing piece of information.\n4.  **Contextualize with Judicial Behavior:** The petitioner's brief, with its blend of deep historical analysis, grammatical precision, and purposive arguments, confirms that successful Supreme Court advocacy often involves creating a synergistic case that appeals to multiple judicial philosophies.\n\n**New and Refined Heuristics:**\n*   **Flexible Search Strategy (Strongly Validated):** My previous failure with a narrow search query led me to create this heuristic. This observation is a textbook validation of its importance. The query \"brief for court-appointed amicus curiae\" did not return the brief itself, but it *did* return a related document (the Certificate of Service) that contained the key piece of information I needed: the name of the *amicus*. This proves that when a direct search fails, broadening the search or looking for related terms can yield mission-critical, indirect intelligence.\n*   **The \"Ancillary Document\" Heuristic (New):** This is a major refinement of my docket analysis strategy. I now recognize that seemingly mundane procedural filings, like a Certificate of Service, are not just noise. They can be invaluable sources of metadata. In this instance, such a document was the key to identifying opposing counsel. In the future, I will treat these documents as potential sources of key information about the actors and timeline of a case.\n*   **Model the Adversarial Process (Reinforced):** My model remains unbalanced, but this observation has sharpened the focus. I am not just looking for \"the other side's argument\"; I am looking for the brief by Michael Hugh McGinley. This makes the goal concrete and underscores the necessity of modeling both sides of the intellectual contest before the Court to avoid confirmation bias and make an accurate prediction.\n*   **Argumentative Synergy (Stable):** The petitioner's brief is a perfect example of weaving text, history, structure, and purpose together.\n*   **The \"Legal Nullity\" Heuristic (Stable):** Remains a central concept for cases involving vacated judgments.\n*   **The \"Scope-Widening\" Heuristic (Stable):** The NACDL's argument linking \u00a7 403 and \u00a7 401 remains a critical piece of context that elevates the stakes of the case, a tactic I will continue to watch for in *amicus* briefs."

This is supported by deep common law precedent, giving it strong textualist and originalist appeal.\n2.  **Grammatical:** The statute's use of the present-perfect tense (\"has not been imposed\") is argued to refer to the sentence's current legal status, not a past event. A vacated sentence has no current status.\n3.  **Structural/Purposive:** The argument centers on finality. The First Step Act was meant to respect final judgments, but a case with a vacated sentence is definitionally not final and is before a court for a new (*de novo*) sentencing.\n4.  **Rule of Lenity:** A fallback argument to resolve any ambiguity in the petitioner's favor.\n\nThese arguments are powerfully supplemented by the **Government's confession of error** (a significant signal that the lower court's reasoning is weak) and the **NACDL's \"scope-widening\" argument** (linking this case to the broader drug sentencing reforms in \u00a7 401 of the First Step Act, thus raising the stakes).\n\nMy previous observation successfully identified the source of the counterargument: a brief by court-appointed *amicus curiae* **Michael Hugh McGinley of Dechert LLP**. The present observation is the result of a direct, highly-specific search for that document, which failed, returning zero results. This is an information-gathering failure, not a substantive development. It does not alter my understanding of the legal questions or the arguments already modeled. The McGinley brief remains the single most important piece of missing information, and my confidence in a pro-petitioner ruling is high but cannot increase until I successfully acquire and analyze the arguments defending the Fifth Circuit's judgment. The task is unchanged, but the path to completing it requires a tactical adjustment.",
          "design_beliefs": "This failed search provides a crucial lesson in the practical execution of information gathering, leading to a significant refinement of my search-related heuristics. It serves as a direct counterexample to the success of my previous, broader search, highlighting the need for tactical flexibility.\n\n**Core Principles (Stable/Reinforced):**\n*   **Problem Decomposition:** Remains the foundational strategy. My model is holding steady, with the missing piece clearly identified. The current challenge is purely in the \"acquisition\" phase of the plan.\n*   **Primary Source Prioritization:** The goal of obtaining the McGinley brief is a direct application of this principle. The failure to do so on the first try reinforces its importance and the need for persistence.\n*   **Model the Adversarial Process:** My model remains unbalanced, and this observation underscores the friction that can exist in trying to build the opposing side's case. The information is not always easy to find, but its absence makes any prediction unreliable.\n\n**New and Refined Heuristics:**\n*   **Flexible Search Strategy (Refined with Nuance):** My last two observations provide a powerful A/B test. A broad, exploratory search for an unknown entity succeeded by uncovering an indirect clue (the Certificate of Service). A narrow, precise search for a known entity failed. This refines the heuristic: flexibility isn't just about trying different things; it's about matching the search strategy to the state of knowledge. When exploring, be broad. When targeting, be prepared for failure and have a plan to broaden the search if the initial precise query fails.\n*   **The \"Ancillary Document\" Heuristic (Stable):** The value of mining procedural documents for metadata remains a key lesson from the previous observation and is not contradicted here.\n*   **The \"Search Granularity Ladder\" Heuristic (New):** This is a major new heuristic born from this failure. It formalizes a systematic approach to searching when a high-precision query fails. The failure of my specific query (`'brief for court-appointed amicus curiae Michael Hugh McGinley...'` with a filter for `'amicus brief'`) was likely due to brittleness in the query or metadata. The new heuristic is to descend a \"granularity ladder\":\n    1.  **Level 1 (High Precision):** Start with a highly specific query including names, titles, and filters. (This is what I just did).\n    2.  **Level 2 (Relaxed Terms):** If Level 1 fails, broaden by removing specific terms. For example, search for just \"McGinley\" and \"amicus,\" or \"court-appointed amicus.\"\n    3.  **Level 3 (Relaxed Filters):** If that fails, remove restrictive metadata filters (like `proceeding_title: 'amicus brief'`) as the document may be categorized differently.\n    4.  **Level 4 (Broad Keyword):** Search for key names or terms across the entire docket's full text, accepting that this may return more noise to sift through.\n    This structured approach turns a failed search from a dead end into a data point that informs the next, more robust attempt.\n*   **Argumentative Synergy (Stable):** The petitioner's brief remains a prime example of this.\n*   **The \"Legal Nullity\" & \"Scope-Widening\" Heuristics (Stable):** These remain key interpretive frameworks for this and similar cases."

The \"known unknown\" of the counterargument is no longer an abstraction; it is a concrete, located document.\n\nThe petitioner's case, supported by the government's confession of error, remains strong and is built on a synergistic set of arguments:\n1.  **Legal Nullity:** The core textualist/originalist argument that a vacated sentence is legally void *ab initio*, drawing on common law precedent.\n2.  **Grammatical:** A plain-language reading of the statute's present-perfect tense (\"has not been imposed\") focuses on the sentence's status at the time of resentencing.\n3.  **Structural/Purposive:** An argument based on finality, asserting that a case with a vacated sentence is not final and is properly before the court for a new sentencing hearing (*de novo*).\n4.  **Rule of Lenity:** The default principle to resolve ambiguity in favor of the defendant.\nThese are bolstered by the NACDL's \"scope-widening\" argument, which connects this case to broader First Step Act reforms.\n\nThe crucial development from this observation is the successful location of information *about* the opposing brief. While I have not yet acquired the brief itself, I have moved from a state of uncertainty to one of certainty regarding its existence and filing status. Through an Affidavit of Service (`26: ...service20affidavit.json`), I have confirmed:\n*   **The brief's exact title:** \"Brief for Court-Appointed Amicus Curiae In Support of the Judgment Below.\"\n*   **The filing date:** November 15, 2024.\n\nThis confirms that the arguments defending the Fifth Circuit's judgment have been formally submitted to the Court. The primary obstacle to a complete analysis of the case is no longer identifying the source of the counterargument, but simply acquiring the specific, now-identified document. My confidence in a pro-petitioner ruling remains high but appropriately capped, pending analysis of the substantive arguments McGinley has raised. The information-gathering task has been successfully refined from a broad search to a targeted retrieval.",
          "design_beliefs": "This observation represents a powerful validation of methodological refinement and resilience. The failure of the previous observation was not a dead end but a catalyst for developing a more robust search strategy, which has now been successfully executed.\n\n**Core Principles (Stable/Reinforced):**\n*   **Problem Decomposition:** Remains the essential framework. The task was broken down into \"understand petitioner's case\" and \"understand the counterargument.\" This observation represents a major success in the latter sub-problem.\n*   **Primary Source Prioritization:** The goal remains to acquire the primary source (the brief itself), and this observation has provided the precise metadata needed to do so.\n*   **Model the Adversarial Process:** My model is now one step closer to being balanced. I have confirmed the existence and filing of the opposing argument, making the need to analyze its contents even more acute.\n\n**Validated and Refined Heuristics:**\n*   **The \"Search Granularity Ladder\" Heuristic (Validated):** This is the most significant outcome. My previous high-precision search (Level 1) failed. This observation's relaxed-term search (`'McGinley amicus'`) was a direct application of Level 2 of the ladder and succeeded perfectly. This validates the heuristic as a critical tool for overcoming search failures by systematically broadening the query. It turns a failed search into a data point for a more effective subsequent search.\n*   **The \"Ancillary Document\" Heuristic (Strongly Reinforced):** For the second time in a row, a procedural document\u2014in this case, an Affidavit of Service\u2014has provided the critical breakthrough. These documents are not noise; they are high-value sources of metadata (document titles, filing dates, party names) that can be more easily found than the primary documents they describe. This heuristic is now a cornerstone of my information-gathering strategy.\n*   **Flexible Search Strategy (Proven):** The A/B test between my last two search actions is complete. The lesson is clear: match search breadth to knowledge. The failure of a narrow search followed by the success of a broader one proves the need for tactical flexibility and a structured method for adjusting query precision.\n\n**Stable Heuristics:**\n*   **Argumentative Synergy:** The petitioner's brief remains a key example of this principle.\n*   **\"Legal Nullity\" & \"Scope-Widening\":** These interpretive lenses remain valuable for analyzing sentencing reform cases under the First Step Act."

L. No. 115-391, \n132 Stat. 5194 (\u201cFSA\u201d), was a landmark, bipartisan \nreform to the federal criminal justice system. Its \nsentencing amendments\u2014Sections 401 and 403\u2014\nplayed a critical role in the law\u2019s passage. The \nquestion presented is whether Section 403\u2019s sentence \nreductions for firearm offenses apply to defendants \nwhose pre-enactment sentences are vacated and who \nare then resentenced post-enactment.  But resolving \nthis question will also decide how Section 401 should \nbe read. Section 401 modified sentence enhancements \nfor drug offenses\u2014the largest category of federal \ncrimes. These Section 401 reforms sought to reign in \na system of disproportionate, arbitrary punishments. \nUnder the old system, a difference of twelve years in \nprison could hinge on inconsistently applied, racially \ndisparate prosecutorial discretion that varied widely \nfrom district to district. This Court has already \ninterpreted portions of the First Step Act several \ntimes, and the provisions at issue here are equally \npressing. By granting certiorari in this case, the Court \nwill \nresolve \nthe \nnow-entrenched \ncircuit \nsplit \nundermining Congress\u2019 reforms. As a result, this \nCourt can transform the lives of those facing the \ndraconian sentences that Sections 401 and 403 sought \nto change. \n \n \n \n \n \n\n3 \n \n \nARGUMENT  \nI. Congress \npassed \noverdue, \nbipartisan \nsentencing reform in the First Step Act, \nimpacting tens of thousands of lives. \n1. The First Step Act is a sweeping criminal justice \nreform law, remarkable in its breadth and depth of \nsupport. Congress voted to pass the Act in 2018 by \noverwhelming margins: 87\u201312 in the Senate and 358\u2013\n36 in the House of Representatives. 164 Cong. Rec. \nS7,781 (daily ed. Dec. 18, 2018); 164 Cong. Rec. \nH10,430 (daily ed. Dec. 20, 2018). At its signing, \nPresident Donald J. Trump hailed the Act as \u201can \nincredible moment\u201d for criminal justice reform, and \nnoted the law\u2019s \u201cunheard of\u201d level of bipartisan \nsupport.2 The Act included three major parts: (1) \nsentencing reform through changes to the penalties \nfor some federal crimes; (2) correctional reform \nthrough creation of a Bureau of Prisons (BOP) risk \nand needs assessment system; and (3) reauthorization \nof the Second Chance Act of 2007.3  \n2. The FSA addressed the increasingly obvious \nflaws in federal sentencing. \u201cInflexible mandatory \nminimum sentences\u201d for nonviolent offenders had \ntriggered \u201can explosion in our Federal prisons,\u201d while \nfailing to \u201cdeter drug use or drug crime.\u201d 164 Cong. \nRec. S7,644 (daily ed. Dec. 17, 2018) (statement of \nSen. Durbin).

As a \nresult, federal sentencing laws had \u201ccreated racially \ndiscriminatory outcomes and increased overcrowding \nand costs.\u201d4 \nBy enacting the First Step Act, \u201cCongress sought \nto recalibrate its approach.\u201d Pulsifer v. United States, \nNo. 22-340, slip op. at 1, 601 U.S. ____ (2024) \n(Gorsuch, J., dissenting). The law was a \u201chistoric\u201d \nexample of Congress \u201cputting [its] words into action\u201d \nafter \u201cyears talking about reducing crime, enacting \nfair sentencing laws, and restoring lives.\u201d 164 Cong. \nRec. H10,364 (daily ed. Dec. 20, 2018) (statement of \nRep. Sensenbrenner). The law\u2019s passage showcased \nbipartisan legislating \u201con a scale not often seen in \nWashington these days.\u201d 164 Cong. Rec. S7,839 (daily \ned. Dec. 19, 2018) (statement of Sen. Grassley). \nSenator Charles E. Grassley noted that Congress has \nrarely had legislation before it with \u201csuch diverse \ngroups of people and organizations that support the \nbill.\u201d 164 Cong. Rec. S7,778 (daily ed. Dec. 18, 2018). \nThe coalition behind the First Step Act ranged from \nthe American Civil Liberties Union to the Fraternal \nOrder of Police and the Association of Prosecuting \nAttorneys. 164 Cong. Rec. S7,839 (daily ed. Dec. 19, \n2018) (statement of Sen. Grassley). Senator Patrick \nLeahy called the bill \u201cnot just bipartisan; it is nearly \nnonpartisan.\u201d 164 Cong. Rec. S7,749 (daily ed. Dec. \n18, 2018). As President Trump said from the Oval \n \n4 President Donald J.

United States, 141 S. Ct. 1858 \n(2021) (No. 20-5904). Indeed, \u201c[t]he Act might not \nhave passed at all.\u201d Id. at 2. Today, the Act\u2019s \nsentencing reforms promise \u201cmore individuals the \nchance \nto \navoid \none-size-fits-all \nmandatory \nminimums.\u201d Pulsifer, slip op. at 1 (Gorsuch, J., \ndissenting).

(citing First Step Act \u00a7 403(a)). \nRecidivism data confirm that the sentencing \nmodifications are working.

This Court and the courts of appeals have \nconfirmed that the Act\u2019s interpretation warrants \nattention. This very term in Pulsifer v. United States, \nthe Court stressed the First Step Act\u2019s importance, \ncalling it a \u201csignificant sentencing reform law.\u201d \nPulsifer, slip op. at 26. The Court also emphasized the \nneed to interpret the FSA\u2019s provisions consistently. \nId. (explaining that this Court granted certiorari to \nsettle a circuit split by determining when a defendant \nis eligible for the Act\u2019s safety-valve relief). The Sixth \nCircuit has recognized that the First Step Act \u201cis the \nproduct of a remarkable bipartisan effort to remedy \npast \noverzealous \nuse \nof \nmandatory-minimum \n \n7 U.S. Gov\u2019t Accountability Off., Federal Prisons: Bureau of \nPrisons Should Improve Efforts to Implement its Risk and Needs \nAssessment System 1 (Mar. 20, 2023), https://perma.cc/YP8W-\n7J3M. \n8 U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, First Step Act Annual Report 41 (Apr. \n2023), https://perma.cc/MV79-2R7S. \n9 New CCJ Analysis Estimates First Step Act Releases Have \nLower Recidivism Rates, Arrests, Council on Criminal Justice \n(Aug. 22, 2023), https://perma.cc/9HJE-ZFMC. \n\n7 \n \n \nsentences and harsh sentences for drug-offenders.\u201d \nUnited States v. Henry, 983 F.3d 214, 218 (6th Cir. \n2020). The Seventh Circuit has described the Act as a \n\u201chistoric, bipartisan attempt by Congress to take the \nlessons of the past and to formulate a new sentencing \npolicy for the United States.\u201d United States v. Uriarte, \n975 F.3d 596, 605 (7th Cir. 2020). And this Court has \nalready considered a handful of cases involving the \nAct in the five years since its passage. See, e.g., \nPulsifer, slip. op.; Concepcion v. United States, 142 S. \nCt. 2389 (2022); Terry v. United States, 141 S. Ct. 1858 \n(2021). Construing the Act\u2019s language clearly merits \nthe Court\u2019s time\u2014particularly in the face of a \nhardened circuit conflict like this. \nII. Taking up the question presented allows this \nCourt to also interpret Section 401(c)\u2019s \nsentence reforms for drug offenses. \n  The petition presents the question of whether \nSection 403 applies to vacated sentences. Petitioner \nhas explained the importance of this provision, which \neliminates the practice of \u201cstacking\u201d firearm offenses. \nBut interpreting Section 403 also impacts those with \nvacated sentences under Section 401, which reformed \nsentence enhancements for drug offenders. United \nStates v. Bethea, 841 F. App\u2019x 544, 548 n.5 (4th Cir. \n2021) (Sections 401(c) and 403(b) construed to have \nsame meaning). Further, the Fifth Circuit has now \njoined the Sixth in a reading of these provisions that \nconflicts with the Ninth and the Third Circuits. See \nPet. 6\u20139.  Thus, the split has deepened since this \nCourt denied review of the same question presented \nin Carpenter v. United States (No. 23-531). Mr. \nHewitt\u2019s case presents the Court with the opportunity \n\n8 \n \n \nto both reconcile a circuit split and settle the meaning \nof two crucial provisions in the First Step Act\u2019s \nsentencing reforms.  \nA. Drug offenders represent the largest \ncategory of federal prisoners. \nMore federal inmates are in prison for drug \noffenses than any other category of crime. In fact, \ntwice as many individuals are in our federal prisons \nfor drug crimes (more than 44%) than for the next \nlargest \ncategory: \ncrimes \ninvolving \nweapons, \nexplosives, and arson (about 22%).10 Sixty-seven \npercent of drug offenders were convicted of an offense \ncarrying a mandatory minimum penalty and almost \nhalf of those individuals remained subject to that \npenalty at sentencing.11 On top of that mandatory \nminimum, an individual may face a sentence \nenhancement based on past offenses. A 2018 U.S. \nSentencing \nCommission \nstudy \nfound \nthat \napproximately one third of drug offenders qualified for \nsentence enhancements\u2014more than 6,000 people.12  \n \n10 Federal Bureau of Prisons, Offenses (Apr. 6, 2024), \nhttps://perma.cc/A7RR-39X7. \n11 U.S. Sentencing Comm\u2019n, Quick Facts on Mandatory \nMinimum Penalties 2 (2022), https://perma.cc/4SNE-25VP. \n12 U.S. Sentencing Comm\u2019n, Report-At-A-Glance: Federal Drug \nRecidivism Enhancements 1 (2018), https://perma.cc/XWG9-\n5JW8. \n\n9 \n \n \nB. Section 401 mitigated the frequency and \nseverity of sentence enhancements for \ndrug offenses, helping to remedy the \nharsh and arbitrary application of these \npenalties. \n1. Section 401 changed the mandatory-minimum \nsentencing enhancements under the Controlled \nSubstances Act, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 801 et seq., and the \nControlled Substances Import and Export Act, 21 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 951 et seq. Prosecutors may seek sentence \nenhancements \nbased \non \na \ndefendant\u2019s \nprior \nconvictions by following the proceedings described in \n21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851.13 Sentencing enhancements under \nboth \nlaws \nare \ntherefore \nknown \nas \n\u201c851 \nenhancements.\u201d14  \n2. Prior to the First Step Act, 851 enhancements \nforced judges to levy harsh penalties on drug \noffenders. The enhancement for a defendant with a \nsingle qualifying drug offense was a mandatory \nminimum of twenty years. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b) \n(amended 2018). If the defendant had two or more \nqualifying offenses, that mandatory minimum became \nlife. Id. Moreover, the old law set a low bar for what \nconstituted a qualifying drug offense\u2014any drug crime \npunishable by more than a year\u2019s imprisonment \nsufficed, including simple possession. See id. \u00a7 802(44) \n \n13 Section 962 of the Controlled Substances Act incorporates by \nreference the procedures stated in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851, making \nSection 851 the operative provision across both statutes. 21 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 962. \n14 See, e.g., U.S. Sentencing Comm\u2019n, Application and Impact of \nSection 851 Enhancements (July 2018), https://perma.cc/7NXA-\n4ZLP. \n\n10 \n \n \n(defining a \u201cfelony drug offense\u201d as one punishable by \nimprisonment for more than one year). This definition \nswept in defendants who were sentenced to less than \na year, released before a year was up, or were \nsentenced to probation alone. An individual who had \nbeen convicted of one prior felony drug offense twenty \nyears \nearlier \ncould \nget \nthe \nsame \nsentence \nenhancement as someone who had been found guilty \nof the same offense only one year ago. The system \ntreated all felony drug offenders identically. \nThese sentence enhancements were not only \ndraconian; they were also inconsistently applied.  A \n2011 study on mandatory minimum sentences found \nthat in most judicial districts, between one quarter \nand one half of all drug offenders qualified for a \nsentence enhancement; in a third of districts, the rate \nwas as high as 50% to 75%.15 The number of \ndefendants actually sentenced with enhancements \nwas lower, but worryingly, the Commission found \n\u201csignificant variation in the manner in which the \nenhancement provision was applied.\u201d 2011 Report, \nsupra, at 260. For example, in six districts more than \n75% of eligible defendants received the enhancement, \nbut in eight districts, no eligible offenders received it. \nId. at 260\u201361. Based on these findings, the \n \n15 U.S. Sentencing Comm\u2019n, 2011 Report to the Congress: \nMandatory Minimum Penalties in the Federal Criminal Justice \nSystem 260 (2011), https://perma.cc/DT3U-D3RR [hereinafter \n2011 Report]. \n\n11 \n \n \nCommission recommended that Congress \u201creassess \nthe severity and scope of 851 enhancements.\u201d16 \nIn early 2018, the Commission undertook a study \nwholly focused on 851 enhancements. The report \nfound that, although almost a third of drug offenders \nqualified for sentence enhancements, application of \nthe enhancements continued to vary wildly, \u201cranging \nfrom five districts in which an 851 enhancement was \nsought against more than 50% of eligible drug \ntrafficking offenders to nineteen districts in which the \nenhancement was not sought against any of the \neligible offenders.\u201d17 Further, the report unearthed \ntroubling racial disparities. Black offenders accounted \nfor 42% of those who qualified for sentence \nenhancements but made up a staggering 58% of those \nwho received enhancements. 2018 Report, supra, at \n34 tbl.5.  By contrast, 26% of white offenders were \neligible for enhancements, yet only 24% received \nthem. Id.  \nDefendants suffered major consequences if a court \nsentenced them under the enhanced sentencing \nregime. The Commission found that, if a prosecutor \nchose not to seek an enhanced sentence, offenders \notherwise eligible for the enhancement received an \naverage sentence of seven years. Id. at 7. By contrast, \nwhen the prosecutor did seek the enhancement, it \n \n16 U.S. Sentencing Comm\u2019n, Application and Impact of Section \n851 \nEnhancements: \nKey \nFindings \n(July \n2018), \nhttps://perma.cc/RL7S-BV84. \n17 U.S. Sentencing Comm\u2019n, Application and Impact of 21 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 851: Enhanced Penalties for Federal Drug Trafficking \nOffenders \n6 \n(July \n2018), \nhttps://perma.cc/AKH6-7WTS \n[hereinafter 2018 Report]. \n\n12 \n \n \nadded another twelve years to the sentence on \naverage, more than doubling the individual\u2019s time in \nprison. Id. In other words, similarly situated \ndefendants were receiving sentences that varied by \nmore than a decade\u2014seven years for some and \nnineteen years for others. The data depicted an \narbitrary system, where punishment turned not on \nthe actions of the defendant, but on the prosecutor and \ndistrict in which the defendant was sentenced.   \n3. Section 401 of the First Step Act sought to \nmitigate the severity of 851 enhancements in two \nways. First, the provision restricted which crimes \nqualified as predicates for most mandatory-minimum \nsentences. Only drug trafficking offenses for which \nthe defendant had served more than twelve months of \nimprisonment now qualified. First Step Act of 2018, \nPub. L. No. 115-391, \u00a7 401(a)(1), 132 Stat. 5194, 5221, \n21 U.S.C. \u00a7 802(57). Additionally, offenses that were \nmore than fifteen years old could no longer support an \nenhanced sentence. Id. Second, Section 401 reduced \nthe severity of sentence enhancements. For example, \nfor a defendant convicted under \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A) who \nhas a single prior qualifying offense, the mandatory \nminimum enhancement dropped from twenty to \nfifteen \nyears. \nId. \n\u00a7 401(a)(2)(A)(i), \n21 \nU.S.C. \n\u00a7 841(b)(1)(A).  If the same defendant had two prior \nqualifying \noffenses, \nthe \nmandatory \nminimum \nenhancement changed from life in prison to twenty-\nfive \nyears. \nId. \n\u00a7 \n401(a)(2)(A)(ii), \n21 \nU.S.C. \n\u00a7 841(b)(1)(A). Because of these changes, defendants \nwith two predicate offenses sentenced today have the \nchance to return home to their families instead of \nspending their lives in prison.  \n\n13 \n \n \nThe amendments made an immediate impact. \nDrug offenders receiving enhanced penalties dropped \nfrom 1,001 in 2018 to 849 in 2019.18 In 2018, the \ntwenty-year enhanced mandatory minimum had been \napplied to 321 offenders. Id. In 2019, the revised \nfifteen-year minimum was applied to 219 people. Id. \nIn 2018, enhanced sentencing consigned forty-two \ndrug offenders to life in prison. Id. In 2019, that \nnumber dropped to eleven. Id.  \n4. By narrowing the pool of eligible defendants and \nlessening the length of enhanced sentences, Section \n401 of the First Step Act mitigated the system\u2019s worst \nexcesses. Still, the harshness of the old regime follows \ndefendants who were originally sentenced before the \nAct\u2019s passage and whose sentences have now been \nvacated. With the courts of appeals openly at odds, \nonly geography dictates whether an individual will \nbenefit fr\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

L. No. 115-391, \n132 Stat. 5194 (\u201cFSA\u201d), was a landmark, bipartisan \nreform to the federal criminal justice system. Its \nsentencing amendments\u2014Sections 401 and 403\u2014\nplayed a critical role in the law\u2019s passage. The \nquestion presented is whether Section 403\u2019s sentence \nreductions for firearm offenses apply to defendants \nwhose pre-enactment sentences are vacated and who \nare then resentenced post-enactment.  But resolving \nthis question will also decide how Section 401 should \nbe read. Section 401 modified sentence enhancements \nfor drug offenses\u2014the largest category of federal \ncrimes. These Section 401 reforms sought to reign in \na system of disproportionate, arbitrary punishments. \nUnder the old system, a difference of twelve years in \nprison could hinge on inconsistently applied, racially \ndisparate prosecutorial discretion that varied widely \nfrom district to district. This Court has already \ninterpreted portions of the First Step Act several \ntimes, and the provisions at issue here are equally \npressing. By granting certiorari in this case, the Court \nwill \nresolve \nthe \nnow-entrenched \ncircuit \nsplit \nundermining Congress\u2019 reforms. As a result, this \nCourt can transform the lives of those facing the \ndraconian sentences that Sections 401 and 403 sought \nto change. \n \n \n \n \n \n\n3 \n \n \nARGUMENT  \nI. Congress \npassed \noverdue, \nbipartisan \nsentencing reform in the First Step Act, \nimpacting tens of thousands of lives. \n1. The First Step Act is a sweeping criminal justice \nreform law, remarkable in its breadth and depth of \nsupport. Congress voted to pass the Act in 2018 by \noverwhelming margins: 87\u201312 in the Senate and 358\u2013\n36 in the House of Representatives. 164 Cong. Rec. \nS7,781 (daily ed. Dec. 18, 2018); 164 Cong. Rec. \nH10,430 (daily ed. Dec. 20, 2018). At its signing, \nPresident Donald J. Trump hailed the Act as \u201can \nincredible moment\u201d for criminal justice reform, and \nnoted the law\u2019s \u201cunheard of\u201d level of bipartisan \nsupport.2 The Act included three major parts: (1) \nsentencing reform through changes to the penalties \nfor some federal crimes; (2) correctional reform \nthrough creation of a Bureau of Prisons (BOP) risk \nand needs assessment system; and (3) reauthorization \nof the Second Chance Act of 2007.3  \n2. The FSA addressed the increasingly obvious \nflaws in federal sentencing. \u201cInflexible mandatory \nminimum sentences\u201d for nonviolent offenders had \ntriggered \u201can explosion in our Federal prisons,\u201d while \nfailing to \u201cdeter drug use or drug crime.\u201d 164 Cong. \nRec. S7,644 (daily ed. Dec. 17, 2018) (statement of \nSen. Durbin).

As a \nresult, federal sentencing laws had \u201ccreated racially \ndiscriminatory outcomes and increased overcrowding \nand costs.\u201d4 \nBy enacting the First Step Act, \u201cCongress sought \nto recalibrate its approach.\u201d Pulsifer v. United States, \nNo. 22-340, slip op. at 1, 601 U.S. ____ (2024) \n(Gorsuch, J., dissenting).

H10,364 (daily ed. Dec. 20, 2018) (statement of \nRep. Sensenbrenner).

Grassley). \nSenator Charles E. Grassley noted that Congress has \nrarely had legislation before it with \u201csuch diverse \ngroups of people and organizations that support the \nbill.\u201d 164 Cong. Rec. S7,778 (daily ed.

This Court and the courts of appeals have \nconfirmed that the Act\u2019s interpretation warrants \nattention. This very term in Pulsifer v. United States, \nthe Court stressed the First Step Act\u2019s importance, \ncalling it a \u201csignificant sentencing reform law.\u201d \nPulsifer, slip op. at 26.

Henry, 983 F.3d 214, 218 (6th Cir. \n2020). The Seventh Circuit has described the Act as a \n\u201chistoric, bipartisan attempt by Congress to take the \nlessons of the past and to formulate a new sentencing \npolicy for the United States.\u201d United States v. Uriarte, \n975 F.3d 596, 605 (7th Cir. 2020). And this Court has \nalready considered a handful of cases involving the \nAct in the five years since its passage. See, e.g., \nPulsifer, slip. op.; Concepcion v. United States, 142 S. \nCt. 2389 (2022); Terry v. United States, 141 S. Ct. 1858 \n(2021). Construing the Act\u2019s language clearly merits \nthe Court\u2019s time\u2014particularly in the face of a \nhardened circuit conflict like this. \nII. Taking up the question presented allows this \nCourt to also interpret Section 401(c)\u2019s \nsentence reforms for drug offenses. \n  The petition presents the question of whether \nSection 403 applies to vacated sentences. Petitioner \nhas explained the importance of this provision, which \neliminates the practice of \u201cstacking\u201d firearm offenses. \nBut interpreting Section 403 also impacts those with \nvacated sentences under Section 401, which reformed \nsentence enhancements for drug offenders. United \nStates v. Bethea, 841 F. App\u2019x 544, 548 n.5 (4th Cir. \n2021) (Sections 401(c) and 403(b) construed to have \nsame meaning). Further, the Fifth Circuit has now \njoined the Sixth in a reading of these provisions that \nconflicts with the Ninth and the Third Circuits. See \nPet. 6\u20139.  Thus, the split has deepened since this \nCourt denied review of the same question presented \nin Carpenter v. United States (No. 23-531). Mr. \nHewitt\u2019s case presents the Court with the opportunity \n\n8 \n \n \nto both reconcile a circuit split and settle the meaning \nof two crucial provisions in the First Step Act\u2019s \nsentencing reforms.  \nA. Drug offenders represent the largest \ncategory of federal prisoners. \nMore federal inmates are in prison for drug \noffenses than any other category of crime. In fact, \ntwice as many individuals are in our federal prisons \nfor drug crimes (more than 44%) than for the next \nlargest \ncategory: \ncrimes \ninvolving \nweapons, \nexplosives, and arson (about 22%).10 Sixty-seven \npercent of drug offenders were convicted of an offense \ncarrying a mandatory minimum penalty and almost \nhalf of those individuals remained subject to that \npenalty at sentencing.11 On top of that mandatory \nminimum, an individual may face a sentence \nenhancement based on past offenses. A 2018 U.S. \nSentencing \nCommission \nstudy \nfound \nthat \napproximately one third of drug offenders qualified for \nsentence enhancements\u2014more than 6,000 people.12  \n \n10 Federal Bureau of Prisons, Offenses (Apr. 6, 2024), \nhttps://perma.cc/A7RR-39X7. \n11 U.S. Sentencing Comm\u2019n, Quick Facts on Mandatory \nMinimum Penalties 2 (2022), https://perma.cc/4SNE-25VP. \n12 U.S. Sentencing Comm\u2019n, Report-At-A-Glance: Federal Drug \nRecidivism Enhancements 1 (2018), https://perma.cc/XWG9-\n5JW8. \n\n9 \n \n \nB. Section 401 mitigated the frequency and \nseverity of sentence enhancements for \ndrug offenses, helping to remedy the \nharsh and arbitrary application of these \npenalties. \n1. Section 401 changed the mandatory-minimum \nsentencing enhancements under the Controlled \nSubstances Act, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 801 et seq., and the \nControlled Substances Import and Export Act, 21 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 951 et seq. Prosecutors may seek sentence \nenhancements \nbased \non \na \ndefendant\u2019s \nprior \nconvictions by following the proceedings described in \n21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851.13 Sentencing enhancements under \nboth \nlaws \nare \ntherefore \nknown \nas \n\u201c851 \nenhancements.\u201d14  \n2. Prior to the First Step Act, 851 enhancements \nforced judges to levy harsh penalties on drug \noffenders. The enhancement for a defendant with a \nsingle qualifying drug offense was a mandatory \nminimum of twenty years. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b) \n(amended 2018). If the defendant had two or more \nqualifying offenses, that mandatory minimum became \nlife. Id. Moreover, the old law set a low bar for what \nconstituted a qualifying drug offense\u2014any drug crime \npunishable by more than a year\u2019s imprisonment \nsufficed, including simple possession. See id. \u00a7 802(44) \n \n13 Section 962 of the Controlled Substances Act incorporates by \nreference the procedures stated in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851, making \nSection 851 the operative provision across both statutes. 21 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 962. \n14 See, e.g., U.S. Sentencing Comm\u2019n, Application and Impact of \nSection 851 Enhancements (July 2018), https://perma.cc/7NXA-\n4ZLP. \n\n10 \n \n \n(defining a \u201cfelony drug offense\u201d as one punishable by \nimprisonment for more than one year). This definition \nswept in defendants who were sentenced to less than \na year, released before a year was up, or were \nsentenced to probation alone. An individual who had \nbeen convicted of one prior felony drug offense twenty \nyears \nearlier \ncould \nget \nthe \nsame \nsentence \nenhancement as someone who had been found guilty \nof the same offense only one year ago. The system \ntreated all felony drug offenders identically. \nThese sentence enhancements were not only \ndraconian; they were also inconsistently applied.  A \n2011 study on mandatory minimum sentences found \nthat in most judicial districts, between one quarter \nand one half of all drug offenders qualified for a \nsentence enhancement; in a third of districts, the rate \nwas as high as 50% to 75%.15 The number of \ndefendants actually sentenced with enhancements \nwas lower, but worryingly, the Commission found \n\u201csignificant variation in the manner in which the \nenhancement provision was applied.\u201d 2011 Report, \nsupra, at 260. For example, in six districts more than \n75% of eligible defendants received the enhancement, \nbut in eight districts, no eligible offenders received it. \nId. at 260\u201361. Based on these findings, the \n \n15 U.S. Sentencing Comm\u2019n, 2011 Report to the Congress: \nMandatory Minimum Penalties in the Federal Criminal Justice \nSystem 260 (2011), https://perma.cc/DT3U-D3RR [hereinafter \n2011 Report]. \n\n11 \n \n \nCommission recommended that Congress \u201creassess \nthe severity and scope of 851 enhancements.\u201d16 \nIn early 2018, the Commission undertook a study \nwholly focused on 851 enhancements. The report \nfound that, although almost a third of drug offenders \nqualified for sentence enhancements, application of \nthe enhancements continued to vary wildly, \u201cranging \nfrom five districts in which an 851 enhancement was \nsought against more than 50% of eligible drug \ntrafficking offenders to nineteen districts in which the \nenhancement was not sought against any of the \neligible offenders.\u201d17 Further, the report unearthed \ntroubling racial disparities. Black offenders accounted \nfor 42% of those who qualified for sentence \nenhancements but made up a staggering 58% of those \nwho received enhancements. 2018 Report, supra, at \n34 tbl.5.  By contrast, 26% of white offenders were \neligible for enhancements, yet only 24% received \nthem. Id.  \nDefendants suffered major consequences if a court \nsentenced them under the enhanced sentencing \nregime. The Commission found that, if a prosecutor \nchose not to seek an enhanced sentence, offenders \notherwise eligible for the enhancement received an \naverage sentence of seven years. Id. at 7. By contrast, \nwhen the prosecutor did seek the enhancement, it \n \n16 U.S. Sentencing Comm\u2019n, Application and Impact of Section \n851 \nEnhancements: \nKey \nFindings \n(July \n2018), \nhttps://perma.cc/RL7S-BV84. \n17 U.S. Sentencing Comm\u2019n, Application and Impact of 21 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 851: Enhanced Penalties for Federal Drug Trafficking \nOffenders \n6 \n(July \n2018), \nhttps://perma.cc/AKH6-7WTS \n[hereinafter 2018 Report]. \n\n12 \n \n \nadded another twelve years to the sentence on \naverage, more than doubling the individual\u2019s time in \nprison. Id. In other words, similarly situated \ndefendants were receiving sentences that varied by \nmore than a decade\u2014seven years for some and \nnineteen years for others. The data depicted an \narbitrary system, where punishment turned not on \nthe actions of the defendant, but on the prosecutor and \ndistrict in which the defendant was sentenced.   \n3. Section 401 of the First Step Act sought to \nmitigate the severity of 851 enhancements in two \nways. First, the provision restricted which crimes \nqualified as predicates for most mandatory-minimum \nsentences. Only drug trafficking offenses for which \nthe defendant had served more than twelve months of \nimprisonment now qualified. First Step Act of 2018, \nPub. L. No. 115-391, \u00a7 401(a)(1), 132 Stat. 5194, 5221, \n21 U.S.C. \u00a7 802(57). Additionally, offenses that were \nmore than fifteen years old could no longer support an \nenhanced sentence. Id. Second, Section 401 reduced \nthe severity of sentence enhancements. For example, \nfor a defendant convicted under \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A) who \nhas a single prior qualifying offense, the mandatory \nminimum enhancement dropped from twenty to \nfifteen \nyears. \nId. \n\u00a7 401(a)(2)(A)(i), \n21 \nU.S.C. \n\u00a7 841(b)(1)(A).  If the same defendant had two prior \nqualifying \noffenses, \nthe \nmandatory \nminimum \nenhancement changed from life in prison to twenty-\nfive \nyears. \nId. \n\u00a7 \n401(a)(2)(A)(ii), \n21 \nU.S.C. \n\u00a7 841(b)(1)(A). Because of these changes, defendants \nwith two predicate offenses sentenced today have the \nchance to return home to their families instead of \nspending their lives in prison.  \n\n13 \n \n \nThe amendments made an immediate impact. \nDrug offenders receiving enhanced penalties dropped \nfrom 1,001 in 2018 to 849 in 2019.18 In 2018, the \ntwenty-year enhanced mandatory minimum had been \napplied to 321 offenders. Id. In 2019, the revised \nfifteen-year minimum was applied to 219 people. Id. \nIn 2018, enhanced sentencing consigned forty-two \ndrug offenders to life in prison. Id. In 2019, that \nnumber dropped to eleven. Id.  \n4. By narrowing the pool of eligible defendants and \nlessening the length of enhanced sentences, Section \n401 of the First Step Act mitigated the system\u2019s worst \nexcesses. Still, the harshness of the old regime follows \ndefendants who were originally sentenced before the \nAct\u2019s passage and whose sentences have now been \nvacated. With the courts of appeals openly at odds, \nonly geography dictates whether an individual will \nbenefit from the FSA\u2019s changes. For the typical \ndefendant eligible for an 851 sentence enhancement, \nthe difference amounts to years, if not decades, of \nextra time in prison.  \nThe FSA\u2019s sentencing modifications garnered \nbipartisan support and have transformed numerous \nlives over the last five years. Yet the entrenched \ncircuit conflict prevents Sections 401 and 403 from \napplying nationwide. It is time for this Court to take \nup the question presented and construe the law\u2019s \nreforms as Congress intended. \n \n18 See U.S. Sentencing Comm\u2019n, The First Step Act of 2018: One \nYear of Implementation (Aug. 2020), https://perma.cc/QMZ5-\nYKC7. \n\n14 \n \n \nCONCLUSION \nFor the reasons set forth above, this Court should \ngrant certiorari.  \nRespectfully submitted, \n \nJeffrey T.

          "task_beliefs": "My model of the case's legal landscape is stable and has reached a point of high clarity regarding the knowns and the primary unknown. This observation, being an internal monologue, adds no new external facts but confirms the successful refinement of my information-gathering objective.\n\n*   **Petitioner's Position (Stable & Well-Understood):** The petitioner's argument, now reinforced by the U.S. government's confession of error, remains a robust, synergistic framework. It rests on four pillars:\n    1.  **Legal Nullity:** The foundational textualist argument that a vacated sentence is void *ab initio*, effectively resetting the sentencing process.\n    2.  **Grammatical:** A plain-reading interpretation of the statute's present-perfect tense (\"has not been imposed\") as applying at the moment of resentencing.\n    3.  **Structural/Finality:** The argument that a vacated sentence renders the judgment non-final, necessitating a *de novo* sentencing hearing under current law.\n    4.  **Rule of Lenity:** The default interpretive rule to resolve statutory ambiguity in the defendant's favor.\n    This is further supported by the NACDL's amicus brief, which provides a \"scope-widening\" perspective, linking the case to the broader remedial purposes of the First Step Act.\n\n*   **Opposing Position (Identified, Content Unknown):** The \"known unknown\" of the counterargument has been successfully resolved into a \"known, but unread, document.\" I have confirmed through an affidavit of service (`26: ...service20affidavit.json`) that the opposing argument is contained within the \"Brief for Court-Appointed Amicus Curiae In Support of the Judgment Below,\" filed by the amicus on November 15, 2024.\n\n*   **Current State of Uncertainty:** My primary uncertainty has been successfully narrowed from \"What is the counterargument and where is it?\" to \"What are the specific legal claims made in the identified amicus brief?\" The entire analytical focus now shifts to acquiring and dissecting this single document. My prediction of a pro-petitioner ruling remains high, but this confidence is explicitly capped pending the analysis of the amicus's reasoning.",
          "design_beliefs": "This observation provides a powerful meta-level insight by demonstrating the value of explicit, structured reasoning within the information-gathering loop. It validates the agent's ability to pause, assess its own knowledge state, and formulate a plan based on previously learned heuristics.\n\n**Core Principles (Stable/Reinforced):**\n*   **Problem Decomposition:** Remains a cornerstone. The agent has successfully completed the sub-problem of \"locating the source of the counterargument\" and is now explicitly transitioning to the next sub-problem: \"analyzing the content of the counterargument.\"\n*   **Primary Source Prioritization:** The entire exercise has been geared towards acquiring the primary source (the amicus brief), and the current plan reflects a commitment to this principle.\n*   **Model the Adversarial Process:** My model is now on the cusp of being complete. The plan articulated in the `THINK` action is the final step needed to balance the model with the arguments from both sides.\n\n**New/Strongly Validated Principles & Heuristics:**\n*   **Metacognitive Checkpoints (Newly Articulated):** This `THINK` action itself is a powerful validation of using explicit checkpoints to pause, model one's own uncertainty, and formulate a plan. It prevents reactive, low-value actions by ensuring the next step is deliberately chosen to address the most significant knowledge gap. This checkpoint serves as the crucial link between successfully acquiring metadata and using that metadata for a targeted search.\n*   **Operationalizing Learned Heuristics (Validated):** The plan to conduct a \"highly targeted search\" using the \"exact title\" is a direct application of the lessons learned from the **\"Search Granularity Ladder\"** and **\"Ancillary Document\"** heuristics. This demonstrates that the learning loop is effective: the agent is not just identifying successful strategies but is actively incorporating them into its future plans.\n\n**Validated and Stable Heuristics:**\n*   **The \"Search Granularity Ladder\" Heuristic:** This remains a validated, critical tool for overcoming search failures by systematically adjusting query breadth. The current plan to move back to a high-precision search (Level 1) now that precise metadata is available is a perfect application of this ladder.\n*   **The \"Ancillary Document\" Heuristic:** This is a cornerstone strategy. The success in using an Affidavit of Service to find the precise title and date of a primary brief confirms that procedural documents are high-signal sources of metadata.\n*   **Flexible Search Strategy:** The need for tactical flexibility is proven. The agent is correctly shifting from a broad discovery search back to a narrow, precise retrieval search based on its current knowledge state.\n*   **Argumentative Synergy, \"Legal Nullity,\" & \"Scope-Widening\":** These interpretive lenses for analyzing the substance of legal arguments remain stable and valuable tools, ready to be deployed on the amicus brief once it is acquired."

The targeted effort to acquire the opposing arguments has failed, reverting my knowledge state and introducing new procedural uncertainties. My confidence in a pro-petitioner outcome remains, but it is now based on an incomplete and unbalanced model of the adversarial process.\n\n*   **Petitioner's Position (Stable & Well-Understood):** My model of the petitioner's case, supported by the U.S. government's confession of error and the NACDL's amicus brief, remains unchanged. It is a multi-pronged argument based on:\n    1.  **Legal Nullity:** A vacated sentence is legally void.\n    2.  **Grammatical:** The present-perfect tense of the statute applies at the time of resentencing.\n    3.  **Structural/Finality:** A vacated sentence is not final, triggering a *de novo* hearing under current law.\n    4.  **Rule of Lenity:** Ambiguity should favor the defendant.\n    The retrieved document in this observation was the NACDL brief, which I have already analyzed. It adds no new information to my model.\n\n*   **Opposing Position (Knowledge Regression):** My previous belief that I had located the source of the counterargument (\"a known, but unread, document\") was incorrect. The highly targeted search for the \"Brief for Court-Appointed Amicus Curiae In Support of the Judgment Below\" failed to retrieve the document. This represents a regression in my knowledge state. The primary unknown is no longer the *content* of the brief, but its *accessibility and location*. The counterargument remains a complete black box.\n\n*   **Current State of Uncertainty:** The search failure has significantly altered my uncertainty.\n    *   **Previous Uncertainty:** \"What are the specific legal claims made in the identified amicus brief?\"\n    *   **Current Uncertainty:** \"Why did the high-precision search for the amicus brief fail, and where can it be found?\" This introduces new possibilities: the document may not be in the available database, the title in the affidavit of service may have a minor error, or the search tool itself may have limitations with such specific queries. My analytical focus must now shift from analysis back to retrieval. My prediction of a pro-petitioner ruling is now held with lower conviction, as the inability to model the counterargument is a critical flaw in my analysis.",
          "design_beliefs": "This observation is a crucial stress test for my design principles, revealing the difference between a sound strategy and a successful execution. The failure of a well-planned action provides more learning than a simple success would have.\n\n**Core Principles (Refined):**\n*   **Problem Decomposition:** Remains a vital principle. The failure occurred within the sub-problem of \"acquiring the counterargument,\" demonstrating that even well-defined sub-problems can have unexpected execution failures.\n*   **Primary Source Prioritization:** This principle is reinforced, but with a new caveat. The *inability* to retrieve an identified primary source is a critical signal that the agent's model is incomplete. The value of the principle is underscored by the current analytical roadblock.\n*   **Model the Adversarial Process:** This failure vividly illustrates the importance of this principle. Without the opposing brief, my model is dangerously one-sided, and any prediction is built on an unstable foundation.\n\n**New/Challenged Principles & Heuristics:**\n*   **Metacognitive Checkpoints (Stable):** The value of pausing to assess and plan is reaffirmed. The plan was logical; the failure was in the tool's execution, not the strategy. The checkpoint correctly identified the highest-value next step.\n*   **The \"Failed Search as a Signal\" Heuristic (Newly Articulated):** A search failure is not a null result; it is a rich source of meta-information. It indicates a mismatch between the agent's query, its assumptions about the data, and the search tool's capabilities. This signal must trigger a diagnostic process and a strategic shift, rather than simple repetition.\n*   **Operationalizing Learned Heuristics (Refined):** The direct application of the \"Ancillary Document\" heuristic to formulate a high-precision search query failed. This does not invalidate the heuristic but refines it significantly. Metadata from ancillary documents is excellent for *identifying* a target, but it does not guarantee successful *retrieval*. Retrieval may require a more flexible approach.\n\n**Validated and Evolving Heuristics:**\n*   **The \"Search Granularity Ladder\" Heuristic (Strongly Validated):** This failure is a perfect illustration of the ladder's utility. The agent executed a Level 1 (high-precision, exact-match) search, and it failed. The heuristic correctly dictates that the next step is to move to Level 2 or 3: broaden the query by removing specific terms (e.g., \"Court-Appointed\") or using more general keywords combined with other metadata like the filing date. The failure validates the ladder as a critical tool for overcoming retrieval challenges.\n*   **The \"Ancillary Document\" Heuristic (Refined):** This heuristic remains a cornerstone for *metadata discovery*. It successfully identified the precise title of the opposing brief. However, its utility for direct *retrieval* is now understood to be contingent on the search tool and database indexing. The refined heuristic is: Use ancillary documents to get precise metadata, attempt a high-precision search, and if it fails, use the metadata to inform a series of broader, more flexible searches (as per the Granularity Ladder).\n*   **Flexible Search Strategy:** The necessity of this strategy is proven once again. The agent must now pivot from a targeted retrieval strategy back to a broader, more exploratory one to overcome the current impasse."

L. No. 115-391, \n132 Stat. 5194 (\u201cFSA\u201d), was a landmark, bipartisan \nreform to the federal criminal justice system. Its \nsentencing amendments\u2014Sections 401 and 403\u2014\nplayed a critical role in the law\u2019s passage. The \nquestion presented is whether Section 403\u2019s sentence \nreductions for firearm offenses apply to defendants \nwhose pre-enactment sentences are vacated and who \nare then resentenced post-enactment.  But resolving \nthis question will also decide how Section 401 should \nbe read. Section 401 modified sentence enhancements \nfor drug offenses\u2014the largest category of federal \ncrimes. These Section 401 reforms sought to reign in \na system of disproportionate, arbitrary punishments. \nUnder the old system, a difference of twelve years in \nprison could hinge on inconsistently applied, racially \ndisparate prosecutorial discretion that varied widely \nfrom district to district. This Court has already \ninterpreted portions of the First Step Act several \ntimes, and the provisions at issue here are equally \npressing. By granting certiorari in this case, the Court \nwill \nresolve \nthe \nnow-entrenched \ncircuit \nsplit \nundermining Congress\u2019 reforms. As a result, this \nCourt can transform the lives of those facing the \ndraconian sentences that Sections 401 and 403 sought \nto change. \n \n \n \n \n \n\n3 \n \n \nARGUMENT  \nI. Congress \npassed \noverdue, \nbipartisan \nsentencing reform in the First Step Act, \nimpacting tens of thousands of lives. \n1. The First Step Act is a sweeping criminal justice \nreform law, remarkable in its breadth and depth of \nsupport. Congress voted to pass the Act in 2018 by \noverwhelming margins: 87\u201312 in the Senate and 358\u2013\n36 in the House of Representatives. 164 Cong. Rec. \nS7,781 (daily ed. Dec. 18, 2018); 164 Cong. Rec. \nH10,430 (daily ed. Dec. 20, 2018). At its signing, \nPresident Donald J. Trump hailed the Act as \u201can \nincredible moment\u201d for criminal justice reform, and \nnoted the law\u2019s \u201cunheard of\u201d level of bipartisan \nsupport.2 The Act included three major parts: (1) \nsentencing reform through changes to the penalties \nfor some federal crimes; (2) correctional reform \nthrough creation of a Bureau of Prisons (BOP) risk \nand needs assessment system; and (3) reauthorization \nof the Second Chance Act of 2007.3  \n2. The FSA addressed the increasingly obvious \nflaws in federal sentencing. \u201cInflexible mandatory \nminimum sentences\u201d for nonviolent offenders had \ntriggered \u201can explosion in our Federal prisons,\u201d while \nfailing to \u201cdeter drug use or drug crime.\u201d 164 Cong. \nRec. S7,644 (daily ed. Dec. 17, 2018) (statement of \nSen. Durbin).

As a \nresult, federal sentencing laws had \u201ccreated racially \ndiscriminatory outcomes and increased overcrowding \nand costs.\u201d4 \nBy enacting the First Step Act, \u201cCongress sought \nto recalibrate its approach.\u201d Pulsifer v. United States, \nNo. 22-340, slip op. at 1, 601 U.S. ____ (2024) \n(Gorsuch, J., dissenting).

H10,364 (daily ed. Dec. 20, 2018) (statement of \nRep. Sensenbrenner).

Grassley noted that Congress has \nrarely had legislation before it with \u201csuch diverse \ngroups of people and organizations that support the \nbill.\u201d 164 Cong. Rec. S7,778 (daily ed.

This Court and the courts of appeals have \nconfirmed that the Act\u2019s interpretation warrants \nattention. This very term in Pulsifer v. United States, \nthe Court stressed the First Step Act\u2019s importance, \ncalling it a \u201csignificant sentencing reform law.\u201d \nPulsifer, slip op. at 26. The Court also emphasized the \nneed to interpret the FSA\u2019s provisions consistently. \nId.

Henry, 983 F.3d 214, 218 (6th Cir. \n2020). The Seventh Circuit has described the Act as a \n\u201chistoric, bipartisan attempt by Congress to take the \nlessons of the past and to formulate a new sentencing \npolicy for the United States.\u201d United States v. Uriarte, \n975 F.3d 596, 605 (7th Cir. 2020). And this Court has \nalready considered a handful of cases involving the \nAct in the five years since its passage. See, e.g., \nPulsifer, slip. op.; Concepcion v. United States, 142 S. \nCt. 2389 (2022); Terry v. United States, 141 S. Ct. 1858 \n(2021). Construing the Act\u2019s language clearly merits \nthe Court\u2019s time\u2014particularly in the face of a \nhardened circuit conflict like this. \nII. Taking up the question presented allows this \nCourt to also interpret Section 401(c)\u2019s \nsentence reforms for drug offenses. \n  The petition presents the question of whether \nSection 403 applies to vacated sentences. Petitioner \nhas explained the importance of this provision, which \neliminates the practice of \u201cstacking\u201d firearm offenses. \nBut interpreting Section 403 also impacts those with \nvacated sentences under Section 401, which reformed \nsentence enhancements for drug offenders. United \nStates v. Bethea, 841 F. App\u2019x 544, 548 n.5 (4th Cir. \n2021) (Sections 401(c) and 403(b) construed to have \nsame meaning). Further, the Fifth Circuit has now \njoined the Sixth in a reading of these provisions that \nconflicts with the Ninth and the Third Circuits. See \nPet. 6\u20139.  Thus, the split has deepened since this \nCourt denied review of the same question presented \nin Carpenter v. United States (No. 23-531). Mr. \nHewitt\u2019s case presents the Court with the opportunity \n\n8 \n \n \nto both reconcile a circuit split and settle the meaning \nof two crucial provisions in the First Step Act\u2019s \nsentencing reforms.  \nA. Drug offenders represent the largest \ncategory of federal prisoners. \nMore federal inmates are in prison for drug \noffenses than any other category of crime. In fact, \ntwice as many individuals are in our federal prisons \nfor drug crimes (more than 44%) than for the next \nlargest \ncategory: \ncrimes \ninvolving \nweapons, \nexplosives, and arson (about 22%).10 Sixty-seven \npercent of drug offenders were convicted of an offense \ncarrying a mandatory minimum penalty and almost \nhalf of those individuals remained subject to that \npenalty at sentencing.11 On top of that mandatory \nminimum, an individual may face a sentence \nenhancement based on past offenses. A 2018 U.S. \nSentencing \nCommission \nstudy \nfound \nthat \napproximately one third of drug offenders qualified for \nsentence enhancements\u2014more than 6,000 people.12  \n \n10 Federal Bureau of Prisons, Offenses (Apr. 6, 2024), \nhttps://perma.cc/A7RR-39X7. \n11 U.S. Sentencing Comm\u2019n, Quick Facts on Mandatory \nMinimum Penalties 2 (2022), https://perma.cc/4SNE-25VP. \n12 U.S. Sentencing Comm\u2019n, Report-At-A-Glance: Federal Drug \nRecidivism Enhancements 1 (2018), https://perma.cc/XWG9-\n5JW8. \n\n9 \n \n \nB. Section 401 mitigated the frequency and \nseverity of sentence enhancements for \ndrug offenses, helping to remedy the \nharsh and arbitrary application of these \npenalties. \n1. Section 401 changed the mandatory-minimum \nsentencing enhancements under the Controlled \nSubstances Act, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 801 et seq., and the \nControlled Substances Import and Export Act, 21 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 951 et seq. Prosecutors may seek sentence \nenhancements \nbased \non \na \ndefendant\u2019s \nprior \nconvictions by following the proceedings described in \n21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851.13 Sentencing enhancements under \nboth \nlaws \nare \ntherefore \nknown \nas \n\u201c851 \nenhancements.\u201d14  \n2. Prior to the First Step Act, 851 enhancements \nforced judges to levy harsh penalties on drug \noffenders. The enhancement for a defendant with a \nsingle qualifying drug offense was a mandatory \nminimum of twenty years. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b) \n(amended 2018). If the defendant had two or more \nqualifying offenses, that mandatory minimum became \nlife. Id. Moreover, the old law set a low bar for what \nconstituted a qualifying drug offense\u2014any drug crime \npunishable by more than a year\u2019s imprisonment \nsufficed, including simple possession. See id. \u00a7 802(44) \n \n13 Section 962 of the Controlled Substances Act incorporates by \nreference the procedures stated in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851, making \nSection 851 the operative provision across both statutes. 21 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 962. \n14 See, e.g., U.S. Sentencing Comm\u2019n, Application and Impact of \nSection 851 Enhancements (July 2018), https://perma.cc/7NXA-\n4ZLP. \n\n10 \n \n \n(defining a \u201cfelony drug offense\u201d as one punishable by \nimprisonment for more than one year). This definition \nswept in defendants who were sentenced to less than \na year, released before a year was up, or were \nsentenced to probation alone. An individual who had \nbeen convicted of one prior felony drug offense twenty \nyears \nearlier \ncould \nget \nthe \nsame \nsentence \nenhancement as someone who had been found guilty \nof the same offense only one year ago. The system \ntreated all felony drug offenders identically. \nThese sentence enhancements were not only \ndraconian; they were also inconsistently applied.  A \n2011 study on mandatory minimum sentences found \nthat in most judicial districts, between one quarter \nand one half of all drug offenders qualified for a \nsentence enhancement; in a third of districts, the rate \nwas as high as 50% to 75%.15 The number of \ndefendants actually sentenced with enhancements \nwas lower, but worryingly, the Commission found \n\u201csignificant variation in the manner in which the \nenhancement provision was applied.\u201d 2011 Report, \nsupra, at 260. For example, in six districts more than \n75% of eligible defendants received the enhancement, \nbut in eight districts, no eligible offenders received it. \nId. at 260\u201361. Based on these findings, the \n \n15 U.S. Sentencing Comm\u2019n, 2011 Report to the Congress: \nMandatory Minimum Penalties in the Federal Criminal Justice \nSystem 260 (2011), https://perma.cc/DT3U-D3RR [hereinafter \n2011 Report]. \n\n11 \n \n \nCommission recommended that Congress \u201creassess \nthe severity and scope of 851 enhancements.\u201d16 \nIn early 2018, the Commission undertook a study \nwholly focused on 851 enhancements. The report \nfound that, although almost a third of drug offenders \nqualified for sentence enhancements, application of \nthe enhancements continued to vary wildly, \u201cranging \nfrom five districts in which an 851 enhancement was \nsought against more than 50% of eligible drug \ntrafficking offenders to nineteen districts in which the \nenhancement was not sought against any of the \neligible offenders.\u201d17 Further, the report unearthed \ntroubling racial disparities. Black offenders accounted \nfor 42% of those who qualified for sentence \nenhancements but made up a staggering 58% of those \nwho received enhancements. 2018 Report, supra, at \n34 tbl.5.  By contrast, 26% of white offenders were \neligible for enhancements, yet only 24% received \nthem. Id.  \nDefendants suffered major consequences if a court \nsentenced them under the enhanced sentencing \nregime. The Commission found that, if a prosecutor \nchose not to seek an enhanced sentence, offenders \notherwise eligible for the enhancement received an \naverage sentence of seven years. Id. at 7. By contrast, \nwhen the prosecutor did seek the enhancement, it \n \n16 U.S. Sentencing Comm\u2019n, Application and Impact of Section \n851 \nEnhancements: \nKey \nFindings \n(July \n2018), \nhttps://perma.cc/RL7S-BV84. \n17 U.S. Sentencing Comm\u2019n, Application and Impact of 21 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 851: Enhanced Penalties for Federal Drug Trafficking \nOffenders \n6 \n(July \n2018), \nhttps://perma.cc/AKH6-7WTS \n[hereinafter 2018 Report]. \n\n12 \n \n \nadded another twelve years to the sentence on \naverage, more than doubling the individual\u2019s time in \nprison. Id. In other words, similarly situated \ndefendants were receiving sentences that varied by \nmore than a decade\u2014seven years for some and \nnineteen years for others. The data depicted an \narbitrary system, where punishment turned not on \nthe actions of the defendant, but on the prosecutor and \ndistrict in which the defendant was sentenced.   \n3. Section 401 of the First Step Act sought to \nmitigate the severity of 851 enhancements in two \nways. First, the provision restricted which crimes \nqualified as predicates for most mandatory-minimum \nsentences. Only drug trafficking offenses for which \nthe defendant had served more than twelve months of \nimprisonment now qualified. First Step Act of 2018, \nPub. L. No. 115-391, \u00a7 401(a)(1), 132 Stat. 5194, 5221, \n21 U.S.C. \u00a7 802(57). Additionally, offenses that were \nmore than fifteen years old could no longer support an \nenhanced sentence. Id. Second, Section 401 reduced \nthe severity of sentence enhancements. For example, \nfor a defendant convicted under \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A) who \nhas a single prior qualifying offense, the mandatory \nminimum enhancement dropped from twenty to \nfifteen \nyears. \nId. \n\u00a7 401(a)(2)(A)(i), \n21 \nU.S.C. \n\u00a7 841(b)(1)(A).  If the same defendant had two prior \nqualifying \noffenses, \nthe \nmandatory \nminimum \nenhancement changed from life in prison to twenty-\nfive \nyears. \nId. \n\u00a7 \n401(a)(2)(A)(ii), \n21 \nU.S.C. \n\u00a7 841(b)(1)(A). Because of these changes, defendants \nwith two predicate offenses sentenced today have the \nchance to return home to their families instead of \nspending their lives in prison.  \n\n13 \n \n \nThe amendments made an immediate impact. \nDrug offenders receiving enhanced penalties dropped \nfrom 1,001 in 2018 to 849 in 2019.18 In 2018, the \ntwenty-year enhanced mandatory minimum had been \napplied to 321 offenders. Id. In 2019, the revised \nfifteen-year minimum was applied to 219 people. Id. \nIn 2018, enhanced sentencing consigned forty-two \ndrug offenders to life in prison. Id. In 2019, that \nnumber dropped to eleven. Id.  \n4. By narrowing the pool of eligible defendants and \nlessening the length of enhanced sentences, Section \n401 of the First Step Act mitigated the system\u2019s worst \nexcesses. Still, the harshness of the old regime follows \ndefendants who were originally sentenced before the \nAct\u2019s passage and whose sentences have now been \nvacated. With the courts of appeals openly at odds, \nonly geography dictates whether an individual will \nbenefit fr\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

It has a nationwide \nmembership of many thousands of direct members, \nand up to 40,000 with affiliates. NACDL\u2019s members \ninclude private criminal defense lawyers, public \ndefenders, military defense counsel, law professors, \nand \njudges. \nNACDL \nis \nthe \nonly \nnationwide \nprofessional bar association for public defenders and \nprivate criminal defense lawyers. NACDL is dedicated \nto \nadvancing \nthe \nproper, \nefficient, \nand \njust \nadministration of justice. NACDL files numerous \namicus briefs each year in the U.S. Supreme Court \nand other federal and state courts, seeking to provide \namicus assistance in cases that present issues of \nbroad importance to criminal defendants, criminal \ndefense lawyers, and the criminal justice system as a \nwhole. \nNACDL\u2019s \nmembers \nrepresent \nmany \nindividuals seeking relief under the First Step Act, \nand therefore, NACDL has a keen interest in the \napplication of Sections 401 and 403.\u00a0\n \n1 In accordance with Rule 37.2, all counsel of record received \ntimely notification of amicus\u2019s intent to file this brief. Pursuant \nto Supreme Court Rule 37.6, amicus certifies that no counsel for \nany party authored this brief in whole or in part, and that no \nparty or counsel other than the amicus curiae and their counsel \nmade a monetary contribution intended to fund the preparation \nor submission of this brief. \n\n2 \n \n \nINTRODUCTION AND \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nThe First Step Act of 2018, Pub. L. No. 115-391, \n132 Stat. 5194 (\u201cFSA\u201d), was a landmark, bipartisan \nreform to the federal criminal justice system. Its \nsentencing amendments\u2014Sections 401 and 403\u2014\nplayed a critical role in the law\u2019s passage. The \nquestion presented is whether Section 403\u2019s sentence \nreductions for firearm offenses apply to defendants \nwhose pre-enactment sentences are vacated and who \nare then resentenced post-enactment.  But resolving \nthis question will also decide how Section 401 should \nbe read. Section 401 modified sentence enhancements \nfor drug offenses\u2014the largest category of federal \ncrimes. These Section 401 reforms sought to reign in \na system of disproportionate, arbitrary punishments. \nUnder the old system, a difference of twelve years in \nprison could hinge on inconsistently applied, racially \ndisparate prosecutorial discretion that varied widely \nfrom district to district. This Court has already \ninterpreted portions of the First Step Act several \ntimes, and the provisions at issue here are equally \npressing. By granting certiorari in this case, the Court \nwill \nresolve \nthe \nnow-entrenched \ncircuit \nsplit \nundermining Congress\u2019 reforms. As a result, this \nCourt can transform the lives of those facing the \ndraconian sentences that Sections 401 and 403 sought \nto change. \n \n \n \n \n \n\n3 \n \n \nARGUMENT  \nI. Congress \npassed \noverdue, \nbipartisan \nsentencing reform in the First Step Act, \nimpacting tens of thousands of lives. \n1. The First Step Act is a sweeping criminal justice \nreform law, remarkable in its breadth and depth of \nsupport.

Dec. 18, 2018); 164 Cong. Rec. \nH10,430 (daily ed. Dec. 20, 2018). At its signing, \nPresident Donald J. Trump hailed the Act as \u201can \nincredible moment\u201d for criminal justice reform, and \nnoted the law\u2019s \u201cunheard of\u201d level of bipartisan \nsupport.2 The Act included three major parts: (1) \nsentencing reform through changes to the penalties \nfor some federal crimes; (2) correctional reform \nthrough creation of a Bureau of Prisons (BOP) risk \nand needs assessment system; and (3) reauthorization \nof the Second Chance Act of 2007.3  \n2.

This Court and the courts of appeals have \nconfirmed that the Act\u2019s interpretation warrants \nattention. This very term in Pulsifer v. United States, \nthe Court stressed the First Step Act\u2019s importance, \ncalling it a \u201csignificant sentencing reform law.\u201d \nPulsifer, slip op. at 26.

The Sixth \nCircuit has recognized that the First Step Act \u201cis the \nproduct of a remarkable bipartisan effort to remedy \npast \noverzealous \nuse \nof \nmandatory-minimum \n \n7 U.S. Gov\u2019t Accountability Off., Federal Prisons: Bureau of \nPrisons Should Improve Efforts to Implement its Risk and Needs \nAssessment System 1 (Mar. 20, 2023), https://perma.cc/YP8W-\n7J3M. \n8 U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, First Step Act Annual Report 41 (Apr. \n2023), https://perma.cc/MV79-2R7S. \n9 New CCJ Analysis Estimates First Step Act Releases Have \nLower Recidivism Rates, Arrests, Council on Criminal Justice \n(Aug. 22, 2023), https://perma.cc/9HJE-ZFMC. \n\n7 \n \n \nsentences and harsh sentences for drug-offenders.\u201d \nUnited States v.

Uriarte, \n975 F.3d 596, 605 (7th Cir. 2020). And this Court has \nalready considered a handful of cases involving the \nAct in the five years since its passage. See, e.g., \nPulsifer, slip. op.; Concepcion v. United States, 142 S. \nCt. 2389 (2022); Terry v. United States, 141 S. Ct. 1858 \n(2021). Construing the Act\u2019s language clearly merits \nthe Court\u2019s time\u2014particularly in the face of a \nhardened circuit conflict like this. \nII. Taking up the question presented allows this \nCourt to also interpret Section 401(c)\u2019s \nsentence reforms for drug offenses. \n  The petition presents the question of whether \nSection 403 applies to vacated sentences. Petitioner \nhas explained the importance of this provision, which \neliminates the practice of \u201cstacking\u201d firearm offenses. \nBut interpreting Section 403 also impacts those with \nvacated sentences under Section 401, which reformed \nsentence enhancements for drug offenders. United \nStates v. Bethea, 841 F. App\u2019x 544, 548 n.5 (4th Cir. \n2021) (Sections 401(c) and 403(b) construed to have \nsame meaning). Further, the Fifth Circuit has now \njoined the Sixth in a reading of these provisions that \nconflicts with the Ninth and the Third Circuits. See \nPet. 6\u20139.  Thus, the split has deepened since this \nCourt denied review of the same question presented \nin Carpenter v. United States (No. 23-531). Mr. \nHewitt\u2019s case presents the Court with the opportunity \n\n8 \n \n \nto both reconcile a circuit split and settle the meaning \nof two crucial provisions in the First Step Act\u2019s \nsentencing reforms.  \nA. Drug offenders represent the largest \ncategory of federal prisoners. \nMore federal inmates are in prison for drug \noffenses than any other category of crime. In fact, \ntwice as many individuals are in our federal prisons \nfor drug crimes (more than 44%) than for the next \nlargest \ncategory: \ncrimes \ninvolving \nweapons, \nexplosives, and arson (about 22%).10 Sixty-seven \npercent of drug offenders were convicted of an offense \ncarrying a mandatory minimum penalty and almost \nhalf of those individuals remained subject to that \npenalty at sentencing.11 On top of that mandatory \nminimum, an individual may face a sentence \nenhancement based on past offenses. A 2018 U.S. \nSentencing \nCommission \nstudy \nfound \nthat \napproximately one third of drug offenders qualified for \nsentence enhancements\u2014more than 6,000 people.12  \n \n10 Federal Bureau of Prisons, Offenses (Apr. 6, 2024), \nhttps://perma.cc/A7RR-39X7. \n11 U.S. Sentencing Comm\u2019n, Quick Facts on Mandatory \nMinimum Penalties 2 (2022), https://perma.cc/4SNE-25VP. \n12 U.S. Sentencing Comm\u2019n, Report-At-A-Glance: Federal Drug \nRecidivism Enhancements 1 (2018), https://perma.cc/XWG9-\n5JW8. \n\n9 \n \n \nB. Section 401 mitigated the frequency and \nseverity of sentence enhancements for \ndrug offenses, helping to remedy the \nharsh and arbitrary application of these \npenalties. \n1. Section 401 changed the mandatory-minimum \nsentencing enhancements under the Controlled \nSubstances Act, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 801 et seq., and the \nControlled Substances Import and Export Act, 21 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 951 et seq. Prosecutors may seek sentence \nenhancements \nbased \non \na \ndefendant\u2019s \nprior \nconvictions by following the proceedings described in \n21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851.13 Sentencing enhancements under \nboth \nlaws \nare \ntherefore \nknown \nas \n\u201c851 \nenhancements.\u201d14  \n2. Prior to the First Step Act, 851 enhancements \nforced judges to levy harsh penalties on drug \noffenders. The enhancement for a defendant with a \nsingle qualifying drug offense was a mandatory \nminimum of twenty years. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b) \n(amended 2018). If the defendant had two or more \nqualifying offenses, that mandatory minimum became \nlife. Id. Moreover, the old law set a low bar for what \nconstituted a qualifying drug offense\u2014any drug crime \npunishable by more than a year\u2019s imprisonment \nsufficed, including simple possession. See id. \u00a7 802(44) \n \n13 Section 962 of the Controlled Substances Act incorporates by \nreference the procedures stated in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851, making \nSection 851 the operative provision across both statutes. 21 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 962. \n14 See, e.g., U.S. Sentencing Comm\u2019n, Application and Impact of \nSection 851 Enhancements (July 2018), https://perma.cc/7NXA-\n4ZLP. \n\n10 \n \n \n(defining a \u201cfelony drug offense\u201d as one punishable by \nimprisonment for more than one year). This definition \nswept in defendants who were sentenced to less than \na year, released before a year was up, or were \nsentenced to probation alone. An individual who had \nbeen convicted of one prior felony drug offense twenty \nyears \nearlier \ncould \nget \nthe \nsame \nsentence \nenhancement as someone who had been found guilty \nof the same offense only one year ago. The system \ntreated all felony drug offenders identically. \nThese sentence enhancements were not only \ndraconian; they were also inconsistently applied.  A \n2011 study on mandatory minimum sentences found \nthat in most judicial districts, between one quarter \nand one half of all drug offenders qualified for a \nsentence enhancement; in a third of districts, the rate \nwas as high as 50% to 75%.15 The number of \ndefendants actually sentenced with enhancements \nwas lower, but worryingly, the Commission found \n\u201csignificant variation in the manner in which the \nenhancement provision was applied.\u201d 2011 Report, \nsupra, at 260. For example, in six districts more than \n75% of eligible defendants received the enhancement, \nbut in eight districts, no eligible offenders received it. \nId. at 260\u201361. Based on these findings, the \n \n15 U.S. Sentencing Comm\u2019n, 2011 Report to the Congress: \nMandatory Minimum Penalties in the Federal Criminal Justice \nSystem 260 (2011), https://perma.cc/DT3U-D3RR [hereinafter \n2011 Report]. \n\n11 \n \n \nCommission recommended that Congress \u201creassess \nthe severity and scope of 851 enhancements.\u201d16 \nIn early 2018, the Commission undertook a study \nwholly focused on 851 enhancements. The report \nfound that, although almost a third of drug offenders \nqualified for sentence enhancements, application of \nthe enhancements continued to vary wildly, \u201cranging \nfrom five districts in which an 851 enhancement was \nsought against more than 50% of eligible drug \ntrafficking offenders to nineteen districts in which the \nenhancement was not sought against any of the \neligible offenders.\u201d17 Further, the report unearthed \ntroubling racial disparities. Black offenders accounted \nfor 42% of those who qualified for sentence \nenhancements but made up a staggering 58% of those \nwho received enhancements. 2018 Report, supra, at \n34 tbl.5.  By contrast, 26% of white offenders were \neligible for enhancements, yet only 24% received \nthem. Id.  \nDefendants suffered major consequences if a court \nsentenced them under the enhanced sentencing \nregime. The Commission found that, if a prosecutor \nchose not to seek an enhanced sentence, offenders \notherwise eligible for the enhancement received an \naverage sentence of seven years. Id. at 7. By contrast, \nwhen the prosecutor did seek the enhancement, it \n \n16 U.S. Sentencing Comm\u2019n, Application and Impact of Section \n851 \nEnhancements: \nKey \nFindings \n(July \n2018), \nhttps://perma.cc/RL7S-BV84. \n17 U.S. Sentencing Comm\u2019n, Application and Impact of 21 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 851: Enhanced Penalties for Federal Drug Trafficking \nOffenders \n6 \n(July \n2018), \nhttps://perma.cc/AKH6-7WTS \n[hereinafter 2018 Report]. \n\n12 \n \n \nadded another twelve years to the sentence on \naverage, more than doubling the individual\u2019s time in \nprison. Id. In other words, similarly situated \ndefendants were receiving sentences that varied by \nmore than a decade\u2014seven years for some and \nnineteen years for others. The data depicted an \narbitrary system, where punishment turned not on \nthe actions of the defendant, but on the prosecutor and \ndistrict in which the defendant was sentenced.   \n3. Section 401 of the First Step Act sought to \nmitigate the severity of 851 enhancements in two \nways. First, the provision restricted which crimes \nqualified as predicates for most mandatory-minimum \nsentences. Only drug trafficking offenses for which \nthe defendant had served more than twelve months of \nimprisonment now qualified. First Step Act of 2018, \nPub. L. No. 115-391, \u00a7 401(a)(1), 132 Stat. 5194, 5221, \n21 U.S.C. \u00a7 802(57). Additionally, offenses that were \nmore than fifteen years old could no longer support an \nenhanced sentence. Id. Second, Section 401 reduced \nthe severity of sentence enhancements. For example, \nfor a defendant convicted under \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A) who \nhas a single prior qualifying offense, the mandatory \nminimum enhancement dropped from twenty to \nfifteen \nyears. \nId. \n\u00a7 401(a)(2)(A)(i), \n21 \nU.S.C. \n\u00a7 841(b)(1)(A).  If the same defendant had two prior \nqualifying \noffenses, \nthe \nmandatory \nminimum \nenhancement changed from life in prison to twenty-\nfive \nyears. \nId. \n\u00a7 \n401(a)(2)(A)(ii), \n21 \nU.S.C. \n\u00a7 841(b)(1)(A). Because of these changes, defendants \nwith two predicate offenses sentenced today have the \nchance to return home to their families instead of \nspending their lives in prison.  \n\n13 \n \n \nThe amendments made an immediate impact. \nDrug offenders receiving enhanced penalties dropped \nfrom 1,001 in 2018 to 849 in 2019.18 In 2018, the \ntwenty-year enhanced mandatory minimum had been \napplied to 321 offenders. Id. In 2019, the revised \nfifteen-year minimum was applied to 219 people. Id. \nIn 2018, enhanced sentencing consigned forty-two \ndrug offenders to life in prison. Id. In 2019, that \nnumber dropped to eleven. Id.  \n4. By narrowing the pool of eligible defendants and \nlessening the length of enhanced sentences, Section \n401 of the First Step Act mitigated the system\u2019s worst \nexcesses. Still, the harshness of the old regime follows \ndefendants who were originally sentenced before the \nAct\u2019s passage and whose sentences have now been \nvacated. With the courts of appeals openly at odds, \nonly geography dictates whether an individual will \nbenefit from the FSA\u2019s changes. For the typical \ndefendant eligible for an 851 sentence enhancement, \nthe difference amounts to years, if not decades, of \nextra time in prison.  \nThe FSA\u2019s sentencing modifications garnered \nbipartisan support and have transformed numerous \nlives over the last five years. Yet the entrenched \ncircuit conflict prevents Sections 401 and 403 from \napplying nationwide. It is time for this Court to take \nup the question presented and construe the law\u2019s \nreforms as Congress intended. \n \n18 See U.S. Sentencing Comm\u2019n, The First Step Act of 2018: One \nYear of Implementation (Aug. 2020), https://perma.cc/QMZ5-\nYKC7. \n\n14 \n \n \nCONCLUSION \nFor the reasons set forth above, this Court should \ngrant certiorari.  \nRespectfully submitted, \n \nJeffrey T.

          "task_beliefs": "This observation, being an internal monologue about strategy, does not introduce new external information about the case. Therefore, my substantive understanding of the legal dispute remains unchanged from the previous state, which was marked by a significant knowledge regression. The plan articulated in the thought process is designed to remedy this gap, but it has not yet yielded new information.\n\n*   **Petitioner's Position (Stable):** My model of the petitioner's argument remains robust and unchanged. It is founded on the U.S. government's confession of error and the NACDL's amicus brief, arguing that the First Step Act should apply based on (1) the legal nullity of a vacated sentence, (2) the present-perfect tense of the statute, (3) the non-finality of the sentence triggering a *de novo* hearing, and (4) the rule of lenity.\n\n*   **Opposing Position (Critically Incomplete):** My knowledge of the counterargument remains a complete void. The previous, highly targeted search for the \"Brief for Court-Appointed Amicus Curiae In Support of the Judgment Below\" failed, and this internal monologue merely confirms the failure and outlines a plan to try again. The content, logic, and legal basis of the argument supporting the Fifth Circuit's judgment are still entirely unknown.\n\n*   **Current State of Uncertainty (Stable but Action-Oriented):** The primary uncertainty is unchanged: \"Where is the court-appointed amicus brief, and what does it argue?\" The previous search failure raised procedural questions about the document's accessibility, and this observation shows an intent to address those questions with a new search strategy. However, until that search is executed and returns a result, my analytical model remains critically unbalanced. My low-conviction prediction of a pro-petitioner ruling is sustained, but it is explicitly flagged as being based on an incomplete and one-sided view of the legal landscape.",
          "design_beliefs": "This observation is exceptionally valuable as it provides a direct window into the agent's reasoning process, demonstrating the active, prospective use of learned heuristics to overcome a failure. It marks a significant evolution from merely identifying effective strategies to internalizing and applying them as a core part of the operational loop.\n\n**Core Principles (Reinforced):**\n*   **Problem Decomposition:** The agent's focus on the sub-problem of \"acquiring the counterargument\" remains sharp, demonstrating the principle's value in isolating and addressing critical knowledge gaps.\n*   **Primary Source Prioritization:** The entire thought process is driven by the urgent need to acquire the missing primary source, reinforcing that analysis without the core documents is unreliable.\n*   **Model the Adversarial Process:** The agent's explicit acknowledgement that it \"cannot model the counterarguments without this document\" shows a deep integration of this principle. The failure is not just a missing document; it's a failure to construct a valid model of the legal conflict.\n\n**Applied Principles & Heuristics (Moving from Theory to Practice):**\n*   **Metacognitive Checkpoints (Strongly Validated):** This `THINK` action is a perfect example of a metacognitive checkpoint in action. The agent paused, diagnosed the previous failure (\"query was too specific\"), consulted its internal library of heuristics (\"validates my 'Search Granularity Ladder' heuristic\"), and formulated a new, improved plan. This demonstrates the value of reflective pauses in improving performance.\n*   **The \"Failed Search as a Signal\" Heuristic (Validated through Application):** This heuristic has now moved from a \"newly articulated\" concept to a successfully applied tool. The agent correctly interpreted the search failure not as a dead end, but as a signal to change its query strategy. This is a crucial step in developing robust, adaptive information-seeking behavior.\n*   **The \"Search Granularity Ladder\" Heuristic (Prospectively Applied):** This is the most significant development. The agent explicitly named and used the ladder to guide its next action, planning to move from a failed high-precision (Level 1) search to a broader, more flexible (Level 2/3) search. This confirms the heuristic's utility not just for post-hoc analysis, but as a practical, forward-looking guide for overcoming retrieval obstacles.\n*   **The \"Ancillary Document\" Heuristic (Refinement in Action):** The agent's plan demonstrates the successful operationalization of the refined heuristic. The metadata from the ancillary document (the affidavit of service) was used to formulate the initial, failed query. Now, that same metadata (\"Court-Appointed Amicus\") is being used to construct a more flexible query, perfectly aligning with the refined understanding that this heuristic is for *identifying* targets and informing a *flexible* retrieval process.\n*   **Flexible Search Strategy (Demonstrated):** The pivot from a hyper-specific query to a broader keyword search is a direct demonstration of a flexible strategy. This confirms that a rigid, one-shot approach to information retrieval is insufficient and that an iterative, adaptive process is required."

          "task_beliefs": "This observation represents another failed attempt to acquire the central counterargument in the case, leaving my substantive understanding of the legal dispute dangerously one-sided and my primary uncertainty unresolved.\n\n*   **Petitioner's Position (Stable):** My model of the petitioner's argument remains unchanged and is the only well-defined part of my analysis. It rests on the combined force of the U.S. government's confession of error and the NACDL's amicus brief. The core tenets are that a vacated sentence is a legal nullity, requiring a *de novo* resentencing under the law in effect at the time of the new hearing (the First Step Act), a conclusion supported by the statute's text and the rule of lenity.\n\n*   **Opposing Position (Persistently and Critically Incomplete):** The void in my knowledge of the opposing argument has not only persisted but has now resisted a second, more flexible search attempt. The `closed_search` action, despite being broadened as planned, failed to return the \"Brief for Court-Appointed Amicus Curiae In Support of the Judgment Below.\" The search instead returned documents related to the NACDL's amicus brief for the *petitioner*, confirming that my search strategy is not hitting its target. The legal reasoning, precedents, and statutory interpretations used to defend the Fifth Circuit's judgment remain entirely unknown to me.\n\n*   **Current State of Uncertainty (Heightened):** My core uncertainty\u2014\"What does the court-appointed amicus argue?\"\u2014is now compounded by a significant procedural uncertainty: \"Why is this brief so difficult to locate?\" The failure of two distinct search strategies suggests the problem is more complex than a simple typo or overly narrow query. Possible explanations now include: the document is filed under a non-obvious title, my search tool has limitations in how it indexes docket metadata, or the document is not in the searchable database at all. My low-conviction prediction favoring the petitioner is sustained, but my confidence in my ability to model the Court's decision-making process is decreasing with each failed attempt to model the adversarial process accurately.",
          "design_beliefs": "This observation is a powerful lesson in the limitations of a given strategy and the necessity of tactical pivots when a chosen path proves fruitless. It marks a critical test of my adaptive reasoning capabilities.\n\n**Core Principles (Reinforced):**\n*   **Model the Adversarial Process (Reinforced by Failure):** The inability to find the opposing brief starkly highlights the importance of this principle. My current analysis is not a model of a legal debate; it's a summary of one side's monologue. This failure makes the need to find the counterargument more urgent than ever.\n*   **Problem Decomposition (Stable):** The sub-problem \"acquire the counterargument\" remains the highest priority. This observation confirms that solving it is non-trivial and requires more sophisticated methods.\n\n**Applied Principles & Heuristics (Critique and Refinement):**\n*   **The \"Search Granularity Ladder\" Heuristic (Partially Fails; Requires Refinement):** The application of this heuristic\u2014moving from a hyper-specific query to a broader keyword search\u2014failed to achieve the desired outcome. This is a crucial negative result. It doesn't invalidate the heuristic itself, but it reveals its limitations. Simply adjusting query breadth is insufficient if the core search term or the search space is incorrect. The failure suggests that the next step on the ladder isn't just a *broader* query, but a *different type* of query or a different search tool/space altogether.\n*   **The \"Failed Search as a Signal\" Heuristic (Strongly Validated & Escalated):** This heuristic is now my most important guide. The first failure signaled a need to change the query's *granularity*. This second, different failure signals that I must change my *entire approach*. Continuing to run keyword variations in the same search space is likely to be a waste of resources. The signal is now \"escalate strategy.\"\n*   **Flexible Search Strategy (Critique):** My previous attempt at flexibility was too limited. I changed the *what* (the query terms) but not the *how* (the search type and space). True flexibility requires a willingness to abandon a method that isn't working.\n*   **Emerging Heuristics / Next Steps:** The repeated failure prompts the formulation of new, more fundamental search strategies:\n    *   **\"Search the Docket Entries, Not Just the Files\":** My previous searches queried the *content and filenames* of documents. A more robust strategy is to retrieve the docket sheet itself\u2014the chronological list of all filings\u2014and manually read the entry titles to identify the amicus brief. This bypasses potential indexing issues or non-intuitive document titles.\n    *   **\"Pivot on Different Metadata\":** The original source that mentioned the \"Court-Appointed Amicus\" was the government's brief. I must return to that primary source document and search for other potential pivots, such as the name of the lawyer appointed as amicus. Searching for a person's name may be more successful than searching for their procedural title. This refines the \"Ancillary Document\" heuristic to be about extracting multiple potential search keys, not just one."

          "task_beliefs": "My understanding of the case remains dangerously incomplete, and this observation has introduced a new layer of complexity regarding the U.S. government's position, while simultaneously failing to resolve my primary knowledge gap.\n\n*   **Petitioner's Position (Stable):** My model of the petitioner's argument remains the only well-developed component of my analysis. It is based on the premise that a vacated sentence is nullified, necessitating a *de novo* resentencing under the law current at the time of the new hearing\u2014in this case, the First Step Act. This argument is supported by the rule of lenity and, I had previously believed, by the government's confession of error.\n\n*   **Opposing Position (Persistently and Critically Incomplete):** My knowledge of the argument supporting the Fifth Circuit's judgment is still a complete void. This was my third attempt to acquire a substantive counterargument (first two aimed at the court-appointed amicus, this one at the government), and all have failed. The legal reasoning, precedents, and statutory interpretations used to defend the lower court's decision remain entirely unknown.\n\n*   **U.S. Government's Position (Newly Complicated):** This observation significantly complicates my understanding of the government's stance. While the initial case summary suggested a confession of error, this search returned a \"Certificate of Service\" for a \"BRIEF FOR THE UNITED STATES IN OPPOSITION\" filed by Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar on May 29, 2024. This filing seems to contradict a simple \"confession of error.\" This could mean the government opposed the granting of certiorari for procedural reasons while intending to support the petitioner on the merits, or that its position is more nuanced than I first assumed. This introduces a new, critical uncertainty: What is the government's actual argument, and why is it \"in opposition\"?\n\n*   **Current State of Uncertainty (Deepened and Broadened):** My core uncertainty\u2014\"What does the court-appointed amicus argue?\"\u2014is now joined by a second major question: \"What is the substance of the U.S. government's Brief in Opposition?\" My inability to retrieve *any* substantive brief after three attempts is alarming. My low-conviction prediction favoring the petitioner is eroding, as it is based on an incomplete and now potentially flawed understanding of the parties' alignments. The difficulty in locating these documents suggests a procedural or database-level issue that is impeding my entire analysis.",
          "design_beliefs": "This third consecutive failure is a powerful diagnostic signal, shifting my understanding from \"my search query is wrong\" to \"my search *method* is wrong.\" It forces a fundamental re-evaluation of my information-gathering tools and strategies.\n\n**Core Principles (Reinforced):**\n*   **Model the Adversarial Process (Reinforced by Repeated Failure):** The failure to retrieve briefs from *two different opposing sources* (the court-appointed amicus and the U.S. government) starkly demonstrates that my model of the legal conflict is not just incomplete, it's practically non-existent. This elevates the urgency of finding *any* counterargument to the highest possible level.\n*   **Problem Decomposition (Stable):** The sub-problem \"acquire the counterargument(s)\" remains the top priority.\n\n**Applied Principles & Heuristics (Critique and Refinement):**\n*   **The \"Search Granularity Ladder\" Heuristic (Proven Insufficient):** This heuristic, which involves broadening or narrowing search terms, has now failed three times. This proves it is insufficient when the underlying search method or tool is mismatched to the task. Simply changing keywords in the `docket_files` search space is a failed strategy.\n*   **The \"Failed Search as a Signal\" Heuristic (Escalated to Methodological Critique):** This heuristic has been my most valuable guide.\n    *   Failure 1 signaled: \"Change query granularity.\"\n    *   Failure 2 signaled: \"Change the entire search approach.\"\n    *   Failure 3 signals: \"The `closed_search` on `docket_files` tool is likely incapable of retrieving the full text of major briefs.\" The tool appears to index metadata and ancillary documents (like certificates of service) but not the primary documents themselves. This is a critical insight into the limitations of my environment.\n\n**Emerging Heuristics / Next Steps (Validated and Prioritized):**\n*   **\"Tool Limitation Assessment\" (New Formulated Heuristic):** When a tool repeatedly fails, I must explicitly diagnose its limitations. My current working diagnosis is that `closed_search` on `docket_files` is not a full-text search of primary legal briefs. Future actions must be designed to either disprove this or work around it.\n*   **\"Search the Docket Entries, Not Just the Files\" (Promoted to Top Priority Strategy):** The repeated failure of file-based searches makes this the most logical next step. I must find a way to retrieve the docket sheet itself\u2014the chronological list of all filings. This would bypass the limitations of the file search, allow me to see the exact titles of all filed briefs (including the amicus brief), and potentially provide docket-specific IDs for targeted retrieval.\n*   **\"Pivot on Different Metadata\" (Validated with New, Actionable Data):** This observation strongly validated this heuristic by providing a new class of metadata: the names of counsel for all parties. I now have a list of lawyers (E. Andersson, M. Kimberly, K. Poloncarz, R. Wilson, V. Jampala, N. Katyal, K. Ross, and Solicitor General E. Prelogar). This provides a concrete alternative search path. If I can identify the name of the court-appointed amicus from the docket sheet, I can search for documents filed under their name."

McGinley to brief and argue this case as \namicus curiae in support of the judgment below. \nINTRODUCTION \nNearly two decades ago, Petitioners terrorized the \nDallas-Fort Worth community through a series of \narmed bank robberies.  They received a trial, and a \njury found them guilty of committing all of the \u00a7 924(c) \noffenses at issue\u2014each one for using a firearm in \nfurtherance of a crime of violence.  The District Court \nimposed a lawful sentence for those offenses in 2010.  \nThen it imposed another lawful sentence for those \noffenses in 2012, after other convictions were vacated \non appeal.   \nPetitioners were serving those sentences six years \nlater, when Congress passed the First Step Act.  Those \nsentences were subsequently vacated, in 2021, when \nPetitioners\u2019 convictions for other offenses were set \naside.  No court has ever held that any of the sentences \nfor the \u00a7 924(c) offenses at issue was legally invalid.  \nPetitioners now seek retroactive application of the \nFirst Step Act\u2019s modified sentencing regime for the \ncrimes they committed in 2008.   \nBut they cannot square their request with the \nstatute\u2019s plain text.  The Act applies to offenses \ncommitted before December 21, 2018 only if \u201ca \nsentence for the offense has not been imposed as of \n \n1  No counsel for any party authored this brief in whole or in \npart, and no entity or person aside from amicus curiae and his \nlaw firm made a monetary contribution toward its preparation or \nsubmission. \n\n2 \n \nsuch date of enactment.\u201d  Pub. L. No. 115-391, \n\u00a7 403(b), 132 Stat. 5194, 5222 (2018) (\u201cFSA\u201d).  As this \ntext makes clear, eligibility for the First Step Act\u2019s \nmodified penalties turns on a simple historical \ninquiry.  A sentencing court must look to the Act\u2019s \n\u201cdate of enactment\u201d\u2014December 21, 2018\u2014and ask \nwhether \u201ca sentence\u201d for the relevant offense has or \n\u201chas not been imposed\u201d as of that date.  If a sentence \nhas not been imposed \u201cas of such date,\u201d then the \ndefendant may be sentenced under the First Step Act\u2019s \nnew rules.  If a sentence has been imposed \u201cas of such \ndate,\u201d then the sentencing framework that predated \nthe Act applies.  Petitioners\u2019 pre-Act sentences for the \noffenses at issue thus foreclose their requested relief. \nPetitioners and the Government have no good \nanswer to this unambiguous text.  Rather, they seek \nto rewrite it in multiple ways.   \nFirst, they encourage this Court to transform \nCongress\u2019s use of \u201ca sentence\u201d in \u00a7 403(b) to instead \nread \u201ca valid sentence\u201d that is not later vacated.  \nPetitioners try to smuggle in this additional language \nbased on a purportedly \u201cuniversal principle\u201d that a \nvacated order is treated as though it had never been \nentered.  But a background legal principle cannot \noverride the text of a duly enacted law.  And, as the \nGovernment \nrecognizes, \nPetitioners\u2019 \nsupposed \nbackground principle is itself \u201cincorrect.\u201d  Gov.Br.26 \nn.4.  In many contexts, \u201cthe historical fact\u201d of a \nsentence\u2019s imposition \u201chas legal significance even if \nthat \nsentence \n(or \nthe \nrelated \nconviction) \nis \nsubsequently vacated.\u201d  Id.   \nSecond, Petitioners and the Government seek to \nremove the words \u201cas of such date of enactment\u201d from \n\n3 \n \nthe law.  They pin their inquiry to the ongoing effect \nof a sentence on the date of resentencing.  But \nCongress tied the inquiry to the \u201cdate of enactment,\u201d \nDecember 21, 2018.  Petitioners\u2019 sentences \u201cfor the \noffense[s]\u201d at issue were undisputedly valid and \nimposed \u201cas of such date of enactment.\u201d  Their 2012 \nsentences were later vacated only because other \nconvictions for other offenses were set aside on \nunrelated grounds.  \nThird, Petitioners and the Government seek to \nsupport their atextual interpretation with a bevy of \nextratextual considerations.  They appeal to drafting \nhistory, generic floor statements, an oblique title, \npurposivism, policy arguments, and lenity.  But none \nof that provides any reason to disregard the ordinary \nmeaning of the text Congress enacted.  And even if any \ndoubt remained, the federal saving statute would \nrequire this Court to construe the ambiguity against \nretroactive application. \nIn the end, \u201c[t]he controlling principle in this case \nis the basic and unexceptional rule that courts must \ngive effect to the clear meaning of statutes as written.\u201d  \nStar Athletica, L.L.C. v. Varsity Brands, Inc., 580 U.S. \n405, 414 (2017) (citation omitted).  Petitioners\u2019 pre-Act \nsentences each qualify as \u201ca sentence\u201d that has \u201cbeen \nimposed as of [the First Step Act\u2019s] date of enactment.\u201d  \nTherefore, the judgment below should be affirmed. \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nA. Petitioners Committed a String of Armed \nBank Robberies in 2008. \nOver 16 years ago, Petitioners Corey Deyon Duffey, \nTony R. Hewitt, and Jarvis Dupree Ross decided to \n\n4 \n \n\u201cdevote[] their respective talents to the enterprise of \nrobbing banks.\u201d  United States v. Duffey, 456 F. App\u2019x \n434, 435 (5th Cir. 2012).  The FBI dubbed their \u201cgroup \nof armed robbers\u201d the \u201c\u2018Scarecrow Bandits,\u2019\u201d due to the \ndistinctive garb they wore during their early \nrobberies.  United States v. Duffey, 2009 WL 2356156, \nat *1 (N.D. Tex. July 30, 2009).  Over the course of \nseveral months, this group \u201cviolently robbed more \nthan twenty banks.\u201d  Id.  \u201cDuring these robberies, \nbank employees and customers were held at gunpoint \nand physically assaulted with firearms and stun \nguns.\u201d  Id. \nPetitioners themselves robbed at least \u201cfive banks \nin the Dallas-Fort Worth area.\u201d  Duffey, 456 F. App\u2019x \nat 436.  They were major players in each heist.  Indeed, \n\u201cDuffey and Hewitt assumed leadership roles of their \nco-defendants,\u201d as they \u201cwould case banks, invite \npotential partners to join in the crimes, delegate roles \nand responsibilities to their co-conspirators, and \nparticipate in the robberies.\u201d  Id.  The Scarecrow \n\u201cconfederacy\u201d executed these calculated operations by \ndescending upon target banks in stolen vehicles while \n\u201cbearing an array of guns\u201d and tasers to coerce \ncompliance.  Id. at 436-37.  On at least one occasion, \n\u201cthe robbers used a taser to stun bank tellers\u201d while \nthey ransacked the bank.  Id. at 437.  These robberies \ncollectively netted roughly $350,000.  See id at 436-37.  \nThe \u201cgang\u2019s crime spree\u201d soon put authorities \u201con \nhigh alert.\u201d  Id. at 437.  By May 2008, FBI surveillance \nteams observed Petitioners abandon two additional \nplanned armed robberies.  Id. at 437-38.  The FBI then \nlearned that Petitioners planned to rob another bank \non June 2, 2008.  Id. at 438.  When their crew arrived, \n\n5 \n \nagents moved in to arrest the robbers near the target \nbank.  Id.  Some of Petitioners\u2019 co-conspirators \u201cwere \narrested without incident.\u201d  Id.  But Petitioners \nrefused to submit to the authorities without a fight.  \nHewitt, Duffey, and Ross\u2014\u201call of whom were heavily \narmed\u2014turned their attention from their crime to \nflight.\u201d  Id.  After multiple \u201chigh-speed chases\u201d and \n\u201chostage-taking\u201d \n(Ross \nbroke \ninto \na \nwoman\u2019s \napartment and held her at gunpoint to avoid arrest), \nas well as \u201cpolice stand-offs\u201d and \u201ccollisions,\u201d \nPetitioners were eventually apprehended.  Id.; \nDist.Ct.Dkt.393, at 176-84. \nA federal grand jury ultimately returned a 43-\ncount superseding indictment against Petitioners, \ncharging them with violations of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371 \n(conspiracy to commit bank robbery); 18 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 924(c)(1)(A)(i) (using or carrying a firearm during \nand in relation to a crime of violence); 18 U.S.C. \n\u00a7\u00a7 2113(a), (d) and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2 (attempted bank \nrobbery); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(g)(1) and 924(a)(2) (felon in \npossession of a firearm); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1201(a)(1) \n(kidnapping); and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2113(a), (d) and 18 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 2 (bank robbery).

A jury found \nthem guilty on all counts, and the District Court \nimposed a sentence for each of their offenses in 2010.  \nPetitioners were then resentenced for the firearms \noffenses at issue in 2012.  Six years later, Congress \npassed the First Step Act.  Section 403 of the Act \nauthorizes reduced minimum sentences for an \u201coffense \nthat was committed before the date of enactment of \nth[e] Act,\u201d but only \u201cif a sentence for the offense has \nnot been imposed as of such date of enactment.\u201d  Pub. \nL. No. 115-391, \u00a7 403(b), 132 Stat. 5194, 5222 (2018).  \nAfter the date of enactment, Petitioners\u2019 sentences for \nthe offenses at issue were vacated because their \nconvictions for other offenses were set aside.  At \nresentencing, \nPetitioners \nsought \nretroactive \napplication of the First Step Act\u2019s reduced minimums. \nThe question presented is: \nWhether a sentence imposed before the First Step \nAct\u2019s enactment qualifies as \u201ca sentence\u201d that \n\u201chas . . . been imposed as of [the] date of enactment\u201d if \nthat sentence is later vacated for any reason. \n \n\nii \n \nTABLE OF CONTENTS \nPage \nQUESTION PRESENTED ........................................... i \nTABLE OF CONTENTS ............................................ ii \nTABLE OF AUTHORITIES ........................................ v \nINTEREST OF AMICUS CURIAE ............................. 1 \nINTRODUCTION ........................................................ 1 \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE .................................... 3 \nA.

McGinley to brief and argue this case as \namicus curiae in support of the judgment below. \nINTRODUCTION \nNearly two decades ago, Petitioners terrorized the \nDallas-Fort Worth community through a series of \narmed bank robberies.  They received a trial, and a \njury found them guilty of committing all of the \u00a7 924(c) \noffenses at issue\u2014each one for using a firearm in \nfurtherance of a crime of violence.  The District Court \nimposed a lawful sentence for those offenses in 2010.  \nThen it imposed another lawful sentence for those \noffenses in 2012, after other convictions were vacated \non appeal.   \nPetitioners were serving those sentences six years \nlater, when Congress passed the First Step Act.  Those \nsentences were subsequently vacated, in 2021, when \nPetitioners\u2019 convictions for other offenses were set \naside.  No court has ever held that any of the sentences \nfor the \u00a7 924(c) offenses at issue was legally invalid.  \nPetitioners now seek retroactive application of the \nFirst Step Act\u2019s modified sentencing regime for the \ncrimes they committed in 2008.   \nBut they cannot square their request with the \nstatute\u2019s plain text.  The Act applies to offenses \ncommitted before December 21, 2018 only if \u201ca \nsentence for the offense has not been imposed as of \n \n1  No counsel for any party authored this brief in whole or in \npart, and no entity or person aside from amicus curiae and his \nlaw firm made a monetary contribution toward its preparation or \nsubmission. \n\n2 \n \nsuch date of enactment.\u201d  Pub. L. No. 115-391, \n\u00a7 403(b), 132 Stat. 5194, 5222 (2018) (\u201cFSA\u201d).  As this \ntext makes clear, eligibility for the First Step Act\u2019s \nmodified penalties turns on a simple historical \ninquiry.  A sentencing court must look to the Act\u2019s \n\u201cdate of enactment\u201d\u2014December 21, 2018\u2014and ask \nwhether \u201ca sentence\u201d for the relevant offense has or \n\u201chas not been imposed\u201d as of that date.  If a sentence \nhas not been imposed \u201cas of such date,\u201d then the \ndefendant may be sentenced under the First Step Act\u2019s \nnew rules.  If a sentence has been imposed \u201cas of such \ndate,\u201d then the sentencing framework that predated \nthe Act applies.  Petitioners\u2019 pre-Act sentences for the \noffenses at issue thus foreclose their requested relief. \nPetitioners and the Government have no good \nanswer to this unambiguous text.  Rather, they seek \nto rewrite it in multiple ways.   \nFirst, they encourage this Court to transform \nCongress\u2019s use of \u201ca sentence\u201d in \u00a7 403(b) to instead \nread \u201ca valid sentence\u201d that is not later vacated.  \nPetitioners try to smuggle in this additional language \nbased on a purportedly \u201cuniversal principle\u201d that a \nvacated order is treated as though it had never been \nentered.  But a background legal principle cannot \noverride the text of a duly enacted law.  And, as the \nGovernment \nrecognizes, \nPetitioners\u2019 \nsupposed \nbackground principle is itself \u201cincorrect.\u201d  Gov.Br.26 \nn.4.  In many contexts, \u201cthe historical fact\u201d of a \nsentence\u2019s imposition \u201chas legal significance even if \nthat \nsentence \n(or \nthe \nrelated \nconviction) \nis \nsubsequently vacated.\u201d  Id.   \nSecond, Petitioners and the Government seek to \nremove the words \u201cas of such date of enactment\u201d from \n\n3 \n \nthe law.  They pin their inquiry to the ongoing effect \nof a sentence on the date of resentencing.  But \nCongress tied the inquiry to the \u201cdate of enactment,\u201d \nDecember 21, 2018.  Petitioners\u2019 sentences \u201cfor the \noffense[s]\u201d at issue were undisputedly valid and \nimposed \u201cas of such date of enactment.\u201d  Their 2012 \nsentences were later vacated only because other \nconvictions for other offenses were set aside on \nunrelated grounds.  \nThird, Petitioners and the Government seek to \nsupport their atextual interpretation with a bevy of \nextratextual considerations.  They appeal to drafting \nhistory, generic floor statements, an oblique title, \npurposivism, policy arguments, and lenity.  But none \nof that provides any reason to disregard the ordinary \nmeaning of the text Congress enacted.  And even if any \ndoubt remained, the federal saving statute would \nrequire this Court to construe the ambiguity against \nretroactive application. \nIn the end, \u201c[t]he controlling principle in this case \nis the basic and unexceptional rule that courts must \ngive effect to the clear meaning of statutes as written.\u201d  \nStar Athletica, L.L.C. v. Varsity Brands, Inc., 580 U.S. \n405, 414 (2017) (citation omitted).  Petitioners\u2019 pre-Act \nsentences each qualify as \u201ca sentence\u201d that has \u201cbeen \nimposed as of [the First Step Act\u2019s] date of enactment.\u201d  \nTherefore, the judgment below should be affirmed. \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nA. Petitioners Committed a String of Armed \nBank Robberies in 2008. \nOver 16 years ago, Petitioners Corey Deyon Duffey, \nTony R. Hewitt, and Jarvis Dupree Ross decided to \n\n4 \n \n\u201cdevote[] their respective talents to the enterprise of \nrobbing banks.\u201d  United States v. Duffey, 456 F. App\u2019x \n434, 435 (5th Cir. 2012).  The FBI dubbed their \u201cgroup \nof armed robbers\u201d the \u201c\u2018Scarecrow Bandits,\u2019\u201d due to the \ndistinctive garb they wore during their early \nrobberies.  United States v. Duffey, 2009 WL 2356156, \nat *1 (N.D. Tex. July 30, 2009).  Over the course of \nseveral months, this group \u201cviolently robbed more \nthan twenty banks.\u201d  Id.  \u201cDuring these robberies, \nbank employees and customers were held at gunpoint \nand physically assaulted with firearms and stun \nguns.\u201d  Id. \nPetitioners themselves robbed at least \u201cfive banks \nin the Dallas-Fort Worth area.\u201d  Duffey, 456 F. App\u2019x \nat 436.  They were major players in each heist.  Indeed, \n\u201cDuffey and Hewitt assumed leadership roles of their \nco-defendants,\u201d as they \u201cwould case banks, invite \npotential partners to join in the crimes, delegate roles \nand responsibilities to their co-conspirators, and \nparticipate in the robberies.\u201d  Id.  The Scarecrow \n\u201cconfederacy\u201d executed these calculated operations by \ndescending upon target banks in stolen vehicles while \n\u201cbearing an array of guns\u201d and tasers to coerce \ncompliance.  Id. at 436-37.  On at least one occasion, \n\u201cthe robbers used a taser to stun bank tellers\u201d while \nthey ransacked the bank.  Id. at 437.  These robberies \ncollectively netted roughly $350,000.  See id at 436-37.  \nThe \u201cgang\u2019s crime spree\u201d soon put authorities \u201con \nhigh alert.\u201d  Id. at 437.  By May 2008, FBI surveillance \nteams observed Petitioners abandon two additional \nplanned armed robberies.  Id. at 437-38.  The FBI then \nlearned that Petitioners planned to rob another bank \non June 2, 2008.  Id. at 438.  When their crew arrived, \n\n5 \n \nagents moved in to arrest the robbers near the target \nbank.  Id.  Some of Petitioners\u2019 co-conspirators \u201cwere \narrested without incident.\u201d  Id.  But Petitioners \nrefused to submit to the authorities without a fight.  \nHewitt, Duffey, and Ross\u2014\u201call of whom were heavily \narmed\u2014turned their attention from their crime to \nflight.\u201d  Id.  After multiple \u201chigh-speed chases\u201d and \n\u201chostage-taking\u201d \n(Ross \nbroke \ninto \na \nwoman\u2019s \napartment and held her at gunpoint to avoid arrest), \nas well as \u201cpolice stand-offs\u201d and \u201ccollisions,\u201d \nPetitioners were eventually apprehended.  Id.; \nDist.Ct.Dkt.393, at 176-84. \nA federal grand jury ultimately returned a 43-\ncount superseding indictment against Petitioners, \ncharging them with violations of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371 \n(conspiracy to commit bank robbery); 18 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 924(c)(1)(A)(i) (using or carrying a firearm during \nand in relation to a crime of violence); 18 U.S.C. \n\u00a7\u00a7 2113(a), (d) and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2 (attempted bank \nrobbery); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(g)(1) and 924(a)(2) (felon in \npossession of a firearm); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1201(a)(1) \n(kidnapping); and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2113(a), (d) and 18 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 2 (bank robbery).  See United States v. Duffey, \n2010 WL 184445, at *1 (N.D. Tex. Jan. 20, 2010).   \n\u201cFollowing trial, a jury found [Petitioners] guilty on \nall counts charged.\u201d  Id.   \nB. A Sentence for Each Offense at Issue Was \nImposed in 2010 (and Again in 2012). \nIn 2010, the District Court imposed a sentence for \neach of the offenses at issue here.  See Duffey.Br.10; \nHewitt.Br.9.  Petitioners appealed, and only Hewitt \nchallenged his sentence.  The Fifth Circuit rejected \nthat challenge.  See Duffey, 456 F. App\u2019x at 444.  The \n\n6 \n \ncourt did, however, vacate Petitioners\u2019 convictions for \nattempted bank robbery and the related firearms \ncounts.  See id. at 443-44.  In doing so, it found no \ndefect in the sentences for any other offense.  Those \nlegally valid sentences thus could have been upheld.   \nHowever, when appellate courts invalidate one \nconviction in a multi-count judgment, they \u201croutinely\u201d \nvacate the sentences on all counts for plenary \nresentencing \u201cso that the district court may increase \nthe sentences for any remaining counts up to the limit \nset by the original aggregate sentence.\u201d  Dean v. \nUnited States, 581 U.S. 62, 68-69 (2017).  Consistent \nwith that practice, the Fifth Circuit vacated and \nremanded for resentencing on the remaining counts.  \nSee Duffey, 456 F. App\u2019x at 436. \nOn remand, the district court imposed another set \nof sentences for the offenses at issue.  See United \nStates v. Duffey, 92 F.4th 304, 307 (5th Cir. 2024).  \nPetitioners do not suggest that any of these sentences \nwere unlawful either.  Indeed, the district court \nimposed the statutory minimum sentence for each of \nthe \u00a7 924(c) convictions.  See Dist.Ct.Dkt.491, at 2-5 \n(Ross); \nDist.Ct.Dkt.506, \nat \n2-4 \n(Duffey); \nDist.Ct.Dkt.524, at 2-4 (Hewitt).   \nAs all agree, the District Court correctly ordered \nthose sentences to run consecutively to each other and \nany others, as was (and still is) required by law.  See \n18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(D)(ii) (prohibiting \u00a7 924(c) \nsentences from running \u201cconcurrently with any other \nterm of imprisonment\u201d).  At the time, Congress also \nrequired a mandatory, consecutive minimum sentence \nof at least 5 years for a first \u00a7 924(c) conviction, see id. \n\u00a7 924(c)(1)(A) (2006), and a minimum of 25 years for \n\n7 \n \n\u201ca second or subsequent conviction,\u201d id. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(C).  \nThese rules (sometimes referred to as \u201cstacking\u201d rules) \napplied whether a defendant\u2019s convictions were the \nresult of \u201ca single proceeding\u201d or separate prosecutions \nresulting in multiple judgments.  Deal v. United \nStates, 508 U.S. 129, 137 (1993).2  The District Court \nfaithfully followed those rules. \nThe Fifth Circuit affirmed, and Petitioners\u2019 initial \nhabeas petitions were denied.  See Duffey, 92 F.4th at \n307-08.  \nC. In 2018, Congress Enacted the First Step \nAct. \nAfter \nPetitioners\u2019 \ninitial \nround \nof \nhabeas \nproceedings, Congress enacted the First Step Act of \n2018.  As relevant here, Section 403(a) of the Act \nmodified the stacking rules for defendants with \nmultiple \u00a7 924(c) convictions as follows: \nSection 924(c)(1)(C) of title 18, United States \nCode, is amended, in the matter preceding \nclause (i), by striking \u201csecond or subsequent \nconviction under this subsection\u201d and inserting \n\u201cviolation of this subsection that occurs after a \nprior conviction under this subsection has \nbecome final\u201d. \nFSA \u00a7 403(a).  In simple terms, a second or subsequent \n\u00a7 924 conviction no longer carries a 25-year minimum \nsentence, if that conviction is obtained in the same \nproceeding as the first.  Instead, defendants face at \n \n2  In 1998, Congress increased the mandatory minimum for a \n\u201csecond or subsequent [\u00a7 924(c)] conviction\u201d from 20 to 25 years.  \nPub. L. No. 105-386, \u00a7 1, 112 Stat. 3469, 3469 (1998).  It did not \ndisturb the holding of Deal. \n\n8 \n \nleast a 5-year mandatory minimum sentence on each \n\u00a7 924(c) count.  See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A). \nAt the same time, Congress tightly circumscribed \nthe amendment\u2019s retroactive application.  As Duffey \nand Ross observe, earlier iterations of the First Step \nAct would have retroactively applied to all defendants.  \nSee Duffey.Br.37 (citing, inter alia, the Sentencing \nReform and Corrections Act of 2015, S. 2123, 114th \nCong. \u00a7 104(b)(2)).  But Congress ultimately took a \ndifferent approach.  It decided to draw a line at a \nspecific date\u2014the \u201cdate of enactment\u201d of the First Step \nAct.  FSA \u00a7 403(b).  And writing from the perspective \nof a body legislating before that date, Congress \nspecified that \u00a7 403(a) would apply only \u201cif a sentence \nfor the offense has not been imposed as of such date of \nenactment.\u201d  Id. (emphasis added).  It is undisputed \nthat Petitioners were initially sentenced (and then \nresentenced) for each of the offenses at issue before the \ndate of enactment. \nD. Petitioners Were Later Resentenced After \nTheir Convictions for Other Offenses Were \nVacated. \nFollowing the First Step Act\u2019s passage, this Court \ndetermined that \u00a7 924(c)\u2019s \u201cresidual clause\u201d was \nunconstitutionally vague.  See United States v. Davis, \n588 U.S. 445, 448 (2019).  The Fifth Circuit then held \nthat Davis applied retroactively, and that conspiracy \nto commit bank robbery is not a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d \nunder \u00a7 924(c)\u2019s \u201celements clause.\u201d  See United States \nv. Reece, 938 F.3d 630, 635 (5th Cir. 2019).  It therefore \nauthorized Petitioners to file a second habeas petition \nchallenging their \u00a7 924(c) conspiracy convictions, \n\u201cbecause the predicate offense for the enhancement\u201d \n\n9 \n \non these offenses \u201cno longer qualified as a crime of \nviolence under \u00a7 924(c)(3).\u201d  Duffey, 92 F.4th at 308.  \nThe District Court granted the requested relief and \n\u201cvacated [Petitioners\u2019] \u00a7 924(c) conspiracy convictions \nand accompanying sentences.\u201d  Id. \n Those are not the \u00a7 924(c) offenses at issue.  \nInstead, this dispute relates to Petitioners\u2019 other \n\u00a7 924(c) offenses, which produced undisputedly valid \nconvictions and undisputedly valid mandatory-\nminimum sentences.  Even so, the District Court \nfollowed the standard practice for multi-count \njudgments and \u201cvacated the sentences on all \nremaining convictions\u201d so that Petitioners could be \nresentenced once again.  See id. \nE. The Lower Courts Held that Petitioners \nAre Ineligible for Retroactive Relief \nUnder the First Step Act. \nDuring resentencing, Petitioners argued that they \nwere eligible for the First Step Act\u2019s new penalties \nbecause none of their pre-Act sentences qualified as \u201ca \nsentence\u201d that \u201chas . . . been imposed as of [the] date \nof enactment.\u201d  FSA \u00a7 403(b).  The District Court was \nunconvinced.  It explained that \u201c[t]he First Step Act \nwas enacted on December 21st, 2018,\u201d at which time \neach \nPetitioner \n\u201cwas \nserving \na \nsentence \nof \nimprisonment \nimposed \nby \nthe \nCourt.\u201d \nDuffey.Pet.App.30.  \u201cTherefore, the amendment to \n924(c) is not retroactive to this case,\u201d and the \nmandatory minimum for each subsequent \u00a7 924(c) \nconviction is still 25 years.  Id. \nThe Fifth Circuit affirmed, holding that the \nDistrict Court\u2019s reading was \u201cfaithful to the statute\u2019s \ntext.\u201d  Duffey, 92 F.4th at 310.  As a matter of ordinary \n\n10 \n \nunderstanding, \u201ca sentence is \u2018imposed\u2019 \u2018when the \ndistrict court pronounces it.\u2019\u201d  Id. (citation omitted).  \nThus, \u201c\u00a7 403(b)\u2019s use of \u2018imposed\u2019 puts the \u2018focus on the \nhistorical fact\u2019 of a sentence\u2019s imposition.\u201d  Id. (citation \nomitted).  And \u201cCongress unambiguously drew the line \nfor the First Step Act\u2019s application based on the date a \nsentence was imposed.\u201d  Id. at 311.  Here, that date \noccurred well before the date of enactment.  The \ndecision below also explained that the legal concept of \nvacatur could not alter the First Step Act\u2019s plain text:  \nA sentence that is \u201csubsequently vacated\u201d constitutes \n\u201c\u2018a sentence\u2019\u201d for an offense that \u201c\u2018has been imposed as \nof [the] date of enactment.\u2019\u201d  Id. at 309-12 (quoting \nFSA \u00a7 403(b)).  As a result, Congress did not authorize \nPetitioners to be retroactively sentenced in accordance \nwith the First Step Act\u2019s modified stacking rules.  See \nid. at 312. \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nThe Fifth Circuit correctly held that Petitioners \nare ineligible for the First Step Act\u2019s modified \nsentencing rules.  \nI.  Section 403(b)\u2019s plain text forbids applying the \nFirst Step Act retroactively to the offenses at issue.  \nEach of the pre-Act sentences imposed for those \noffenses qualifies as \u201ca sentence for the offense\u201d that \n\u201chas . . . been imposed as of [the First Step Act\u2019s] date \nof enactment.\u201d  FSA \u00a7 403(b). \nA.  This understanding is most faithful to the \nordinary meaning of \u201ca sentence.\u201d  A \u201csentence\u201d is \n\u201c[t]he judgment that a court formally pronounces after \nfinding a criminal defendant guilty.\u201d  Black\u2019s Law \nDictionary 1636 (11th ed. 2019).  And Congress chose \nnot to limit the types of sentences that would prevent \n\n11 \n \nretroactivity here.  On the contrary, it introduced the \nword \u201csentence\u201d with the indefinite article \u201ca,\u201d which \nis used in common parlance to point to a nonspecific \nobject.  That means any type of sentence that has been \nimposed for an offense counts, even if it was \nsubsequently vacated.  \nPetitioners argue that Congress might have better \nreflected this understanding by using the word \u201cany\u201d \ninstead of \u201ca.\u201d  But the words are synonymous.  And \nthe fact that Congress might have expressed itself \nmore clearly provides no license to disregard the \nactual statutory text.  Nor does the meaningful-\nvariation canon.  That canon is irrelevant to \nubiquitous and interchangeable words like \u201cany\u201d and \n\u201ca,\u201d particularly where, as here, they are used to \nintroduce different terms. \nSeeking to add to the statute, Duffey and Ross also \ninsist that the ordinary meaning of \u201ca sentence\u201d is \u201ca \nvalid sentence.\u201d  But that is not the text Congress \nenacted.  And even that litigator\u2019s amendment does \nnot rescue their claim.  Their prior sentences were \nlegally valid on December 21, 2018, and they were \nlater vacated only because other convictions were set \naside for unrelated legal error.  Thus, Petitioners were \nserving \u201ca [valid] sentence for the offense[s]\u201d at issue \n\u201cas of such date of enactment.\u201d \nB.  Section 403(b)\u2019s use of the verb \u201cimposed\u201d \nreinforces Congress\u2019s focus on the historical fact of a \nsentence\u2019s imposition.  A sentence is \u201cimposed\u201d when \nit is pronounced.  For that reason, both this Court and \nCongress have frequently described a vacated \nsentence as one that nevertheless has been imposed.  \nDuffey and Ross offer no textual basis for dispensing \n\n12 \n \nwith this ordinary meaning.  Hewitt cherry-picks a \ncontrary definition of \u201cimposed\u201d that could fit only if \n\u00a7 403(b)\u2019s sentence structure and object were changed.  \nAnd the Government offers a pair of unpersuasive \narguments that flout the text and ignore the realities \nof both vacatur and sentencing. \nC.  Congress\u2019s use of the present-perfect tense\u2014\n\u201chas not been imposed\u201d\u2014only confirms the Fifth \nCircuit\u2019s reading.  That tense is used to describe an act \nthat is either ongoing or completed at some indefinite \npoint in the past.  Because the operative verb here is \n\u201cimposed,\u201d only the latter usage makes sense.  The \nimposition of a sentence occurs at a particular point in \ntime when a judge pronounces the sentence in open \ncourt.  That occurred here in 2010 and then again in \n2012 for each of the relevant offenses. \nPetitioners and the Government counter that this \ninterpretation works only with the past-perfect \ntense\u2014\u201chad not been imposed.\u201d  That is incorrect.  \nTime and again, Congress has used the present-\nperfect when dictating a statute\u2019s application to \npending cases at the time of enactment, just as it did \nin the First Step Act.  That is because Congress \nlegislates in real-time.  It would be incongruous for \nCongress to employ the past-perfect when drawing a \nline in that present moment as to who is in and who is \nout. \nIn any case, Petitioners would fall on the wrong \nside of the line even if they were right that the present-\nperfect ties the inquiry to the \u201congoing\u201d imposition of \na sentence.  The text would still ask whether such a \nsentence has or \u201chas not been imposed as of [the] date \nof enactment.\u201d  As of that date, Petitioners were all \n\n13 \n \nserving ongoing sentences for the offenses at issue.  \nTheir contrary argument seeks to delete that critical \ntiming provision from the statute. \nII. Petitioners ultimately cannot square their \ninterpretation with the ordinary meaning of \u00a7 403(b).  \nSo they resort to atextual considerations.  In their \nview, a background legal principle exists that a \nvacated sentence is no sentence at all.  And they \nsuggest that Congress silently incorporated this \npurported principle into \u00a7 403(b).  This argument fails \nfor three reasons. \nA. First, in a contest between text and background \nprinciples, the text prevails.  Indeed, it is telling that \neven Petitioners\u2019 own vacatur decisions refer to a \nvacated sentence as \u201ca sentence.\u201d  That is the language \nCongress used in the First Step Act.  And that \nlanguage controls here. \nB. Second, there is no background principle that a \nvacated sentence must be disregarded for all purposes.  \nEven the Government concedes that a vacated order is \nrelevant in many contexts, including several related to \nsentencing.  Congress has also shown that it knows \nhow to exclude vacated convictions or sentences from \na statute\u2019s reach when it wants to do so.  It chose not \nto here.  And each of Petitioners\u2019 purported \ncounterexamples is inapposite.  In fact, many defeat \nthe universal principle they strain to establish. \nC. Third, \nPetitioners\u2019 \nimplicit \nbackground \nprinciple cannot override the federal saving statute\u2019s \nexplicit direction that a sentencing law does not apply \nretroactively unless it \u201cshall so expressly provide.\u201d  1 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 109.  Given that command, this Court has \nrequired a clear statement before applying new \n\n14 \n \npenalties to pre-enactment conduct.  Congress came \nnowhere close to providing such a clear statement \nhere.   \nIII. Petitioners and the Government fare no better \nwith any of their other extratextual arguments. \nA. Duffey and Ross note that prior iterations of the \nFirst Step Act would have applied retroactively to all \ndefendants.  But the fact that Congress abandoned an \napproach that would have afforded Petitioners relief \nonly undermines their attempt to smuggle that \nrejected policy into the text Congress later enacted. \nB. Duffey and Ross next seek support in \u00a7 403\u2019s \ntitle.  But that title says only that Congress was \n\u201cclarif[ying] . . . Section 924(c),\u201d to abrogate this \nCourt\u2019s decision in Deal.  It says nothing about the \namended \u00a7 924(c)\u2019s retroactivity.  A title cannot \novercome the operative statutory text in any event.  \nAnd, even if it could, the more relevant title is \n\u00a7 403(b)\u2019s, which specifies the Act\u2019s \u201capplicability to \npending cases.\u201d  Petitioners\u2019 cases were not pending as \nof the date of enactment. \nC. Petitioners\u2019 and the Government\u2019s reliance on \nlegislative history is similarly misplaced.  Legislative \nhistory is not the law.  And the floor statements they \nquote provide no basis to depart from the statutory \nlanguage \nthat \nsurvived \nbicameralism \nand \npresentment.  Nor do any of those general statements \naddress the question presented. \nD. Petitioners and the Government also appeal to \npurpose and policy.  But there is no better indication \nof where Congress landed as a policy matter than the \ntext it ratified through a formal vote.  That text is \nwhat matters.  And there are many reasons why \n\n15 \n \nCongress might have thought it preferable to base \neligibility on the imposition of a sentence prior to \nenactment, even if that sentence is later vacated.  In \nfact, doing so furthers the very fairness principles that \nPetitioners espouse. \nE. Finally, the rule of lenity is inapplicable.  \nSection 403(b) contains no grievous ambiguity that \ncould potentially trigger the rule.  Even if it did, lenity \nstill would play no role in defining the retroactive \nscope of this sentencing statute.  Whether a \nsentencing law applies retroactively poses no fair-\nnotice concerns.  And the federal saving statute directs \ncourts to resolve any ambiguity against retroactive \napplication. \nFor all these reasons, the judgment below should \nbe affirmed. \nARGUMENT \nI. \nThe Ordinary Meaning Of Section 403(b) \nEstablishes That Petitioners Are Ineligible \nFor Retroactive Application Of The First \nStep Act. \nWhen interpreting a statute, a court\u2019s \u201cjob is to \ninterpret the words consistent with their ordinary \nmeaning at the time Congress enacted the statute.\u201d  \nWis. Cent. Ltd. v. United States, 585 U.S. 274, 277 \n(2018) (alteration adopted; citation omitted).   And \n\u201c[w]here, as here, that examination yields a clear \nanswer, judges must stop.\u201d  Food Mktg. Inst. v. Argus \nLeader Media, 588 U.S. 427, 436 (2019). \nThrough the First Step Act, Congress modified the \nmandatory-minimum rules for a defendant who uses \nor carries a firearm in furtherance of multiple crimes \n\n16 \n \nof violence.  See FSA \u00a7 403(a).  But Congress specified \nthat these new rules apply to previous offenses only \u201cif \na sentence for the offense has not been imposed as of \nsuch date of enactment.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 403(b).  Thus, if \u201ca \nsentence for the offense has . . . been imposed as of \n[December 21, 2018],\u201d the statutory framework that \npredated the First Step Act applies.   \nThat is the case here.  Petitioners \u201cindisputably \nhad been sentenced\u201d for the offenses at issue (twice) \n\u201cbefore the First Step Act took effect.\u201d  United States \nv. Uriarte, 975 F.3d 596, 606 (7th Cir. 2020) (Barrett, \nJ., dissenting).  That historical fact forecloses their \nclaim to retroactive application of the First Step Act\u2019s \nmodified regime.   \nA. The Decision Below Respects the Plain \nMeaning of \u201cA Sentence.\u201d \nStart with the statute\u2019s reference to \u201ca sentence.\u201d  \nAs Petitioners and the Government observe, a \n\u201csentence\u201d is \u201c[t]he judgment that a court formally \npronounces after finding a criminal defendant guilty.\u201d  \nBlack\u2019s Law Dictionary, supra, at 1636; Gov.Br.16; \nDuffey.Br.16.  Amicus agrees that this definition \n\u201caccurately captures the ordinary meaning\u201d of the \nterm.  United States v. Hernandez, 107 F.4th 965, 968 \n(11th Cir. 2024).  But it affirmatively cuts against \nPetitioners and the Government here.  Petitioners\u2019 \noriginal sentences were plainly \u201c\u2018judgment[s]\u2019 that the \ndistrict court \u2018pronounced\u2019 upon \u2018finding [Petitioners] \nguilty.\u2019\u201d  Id. at 969 (alteration adopted).  Accordingly, \ntheir own \u201cdefinition fits [Petitioners\u2019] original \nsentence[s] to a T.\u201d  Id. \nThere is no indication that Congress meant to \ncapture only the final sentence that a defendant might \n\n17 \n \nreceive for an offense.  Had Congress intended to \nimpose such a limitation, it could have easily \nreferenced finality\u2014as it did in the immediately \npreceding subsection of the First Step Act.  See FSA \n\u00a7 403(a) (limiting the 25-year enhancement to \u00a7 924(c) \nconvictions that follow a prior \u00a7 924(c) conviction that \n\u201chas become final\u201d).  Or Congress could have achieved \nthat result by referring to \u201ca valid sentence,\u201d or \u201ca \nsentence that continues to legally bind the defendant,\u201d \nor perhaps even to \u201cthe sentence.\u201d  Hernandez, 107 \nF.4th at 969; Uriarte, 975 F.3d at 608 (Barrett, J., \ndissenting).   \nBut Congress instead chose to introduce the term \n\u201csentence\u201d with the indefinite article \u201ca.\u201d  That choice \nof article matters in discerning statutory meaning.  \nSee Corner Post, Inc. v. Bd. of Governors of Fed. Rsrv. \nSys., 144 S. Ct. 2440, 2455 (2024).  And \u201c[w]hen used \nas an indefinite article, \u2018a\u2019 means \u2018some undetermined \nor unspecified particular.\u2019\u201d  McFadden v. United \nStates, 576 U.S. 186, 191 (2015) (alteration adopted) \n(quoting Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary 1 (2d \ned. 1954)); see also Chicago Manual of Style \u00b6 5.72 \n(17th ed. 2017) (\u201cAn indefinite article points to a \nnonspecific object, thing, or person that is not \ndistinguished from the other members of a class.\u201d); \nBryan A. Garner, Garner\u2019s Modern English Usage \n1195 (5th ed. 2022) (similar).   \nThe indefinite article \u201ca\u201d is thus synonymous with \nthe word \u201cany.\u201d  See, e.g., Merriam-Webster\u2019s \nCollegiate Dictionary 1 (11th ed. 2020); 1 Oxford \nEnglish Dictionary 4 (2d ed. 1991); Hernandez, 107 \nF.4th at 969.  Consequently, Congress\u2019s use of the \nindefinite article is \u201cbroad enough to refer to any \n\n18 \n \nsentence that has been imposed for the offense, even \none that was subsequently vacated.\u201d  Uriarte, 975 F.3d \nat 608 (Barrett, J., dissenting).  That is still \u201ca \nsentence\u201d for the offense. \nDuffey, Ross, and the Government (but not Hewitt) \nresist this ordinary meaning by noting that Congress \ncould have expressly used the word \u201cany\u201d instead of \n\u201ca.\u201d  Gov.Br.19; Duffey.Br.31.  But the words are \nsynonymous.  And this Court \u201cdo[es] not demand (or \nin truth expect) that Congress draft in the most \ntranslucent way possible.\u201d  Pulsifer v. United States, \n601 U.S. 124, 137 (2024).  Even if \u201cCongress could have \nexpressed itself more clearly,\u201d that does not change \nthe fact that the decision below adopted the \u201cright and \nfair reading of the statute.\u201d  Luna Torres v. Lynch, 578 \nU.S. 452, 472-73 (2016).   \nStuck with this ordinary meaning, Duffey, Ross, \nand the Government pivot to the meaningful-variation \ncanon.  They emphasize Congress\u2019s earlier use of the \nphrase \u201cany offense\u201d and suggest that the contrasting \nuse of \u201cany\u201d and \u201ca\u201d between \u201cany offense\u201d and \u201ca \nsentence\u201d must subtly convey something.  Gov.Br.19-\n20; Duffey.Br.32.  But Congress\u2019s use of synonymous \nterms is not a variation, let alone a meaningful one.  \nMoreover, the meaningful-variation canon\u2019s weight \n\u201cgrows weaker with each difference in the formulation \nof the provisions under inspection.\u201d  City of Columbus \nv. Ours Garage & Wrecker Serv., Inc., 536 U.S. 424, \n435-36 (2002).  That is precisely the case here.  The \nnouns to which the two words are appended\u2014\u201coffense\u201d \nand \u201csentence\u201d\u2014are different.  And they serve \ndifferent grammatical functions within the statute, \nwith \u201cany offense\u201d serving as the direct object of an \n\n19 \n \nindependent clause and \u201ca sentence\u201d serving as the \nsubject of a conditional dependent clause.  \nPetitioners\u2019 argument also founders because the \nmeaningful-variation canon \u201cis mostly applied to \nterms with some heft and distinctiveness, whose use \ndrafters are likely to keep track of and standardize.\u201d  \nPulsifer, 601 U.S. at 149.  It is less apt for \u201cubiquitous\u201d \n(and synonymous) words like \u201ca\u201d and \u201cany.\u201d  Id.  These \nwords are often used interchangeably in ordinary \nspeech and legislative drafting.3  And this just goes to \nshow why \u201cinterpretative canons are not a license for \nthe judiciary to rewrite language enacted by the \nlegislature.\u201d  United States v. Monsanto, 491 U.S. 600, \n611 (1989) (brackets and citation omitted); see also \nAntonin Scalia & Bryan A. Garner, Reading Law: The \nInterpretation of Legal Texts 51 (2012) (emphasizing \nthat the interpretive canons \u201care not \u2018rules\u2019 of \n \n3  The First Step Act itself provides an example.  The \u201csafety \nvalve\u201d provision in Section 402 determines eligibility based on a \ndefendant\u2019s total criminal history points, \u201cexcluding any criminal \nhistory points resulting from a 1-point offense.\u201d  FSA \u00a7 402(a) \n(emphases added).  But Congress of course did not mean to \nexclude certain \u201c1-point offense[s]\u201d simply because it used the \nword \u201ca\u201d instead of \u201cany.\u201d  Nor did Congress mean to exclude \ncertain \u201cfirearm[s]\u201d from \u00a7 924(c)\u2019s reach merely because it used \nthe phrases \u201ca firearm\u201d and \u201cany crime of violence\u201d in the same \nsubparagraph.  18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A).  Other examples of this \nfungible use of \u201ca\u201d and \u201cany\u201d abound.  See, e.g., id. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(D)(i) \n(\u201cany person convicted of a violation\u201d); Smith v. United States, \n599 U.S. 236, 244 (2023) (\u201c[A]nd a defendant charged with \nillegally shipping goods may be tried in any State through which \nthe \ngoods \nwere \nillegally \ntransported[.]\u201d); \nMacquarie \nInfrastructure Corp. v. Moab Partners, L.P., 601 U.S. 257, 264 \n(2024) (\u201cSection 11(a) prohibits any registration statement that \n\u2018contains an untrue statement of a material fact[.]\u2019\u201d (brackets and \ncitation omitted)). \n\n20 \n \ninterpretation in any strict sense\u201d).  A court\u2019s \nobligation is to the ordinary meaning of the text. \nDuffey and Ross also argue that the \u201cordinary \nmeaning of the term \u2018sentence\u2019 is a valid sentence.\u201d  \nDuffey.Br.14.  This is nothing but an attempt to \u201cadd \nwords to the law to produce what is thought to be a \ndesirable result.\u201d  EEOC v. Abercrombie & Fitch \nStores, Inc., 575 U.S. 768, 774 (2015).  \u201c[O]ur \nconstitutional structure does not permit\u201d courts \u201cto \n\u2018rewrite the statute that Congress has enacted.\u2019\u201d  \nPuerto Rico v. Franklin Cal. Tax-Free Tr., 579 U.S. \n115, 130 (2016) (citation omitted).  Congress chose to \ndetermine eligibility based on whether \u201ca sentence\u201d for \nthe offense has been imposed as of December 2018, \nand courts must respect that choice. \nNor does Petitioners\u2019 revision of the statute help \nthem.  Nobody disputes that Petitioners each \nreceived\u2014and were serving\u2014\u201ca [valid] sentence for \nthe offense[s]\u201d at issue \u201cas of [the] date of enactment.\u201d  \nFSA \u00a7 403(b) (emphasis added).  That is the date that \nmatters under the statute\u2019s plain text.  Petitioners\u2019 \nsentences were later vacated only because their \nconvictions for other offenses were invalidated.  See \nDuffey, 92 F.4th at 308.  In other words, their \nsentences for the offenses at issue \u201cwere legally valid \nat the time of the enactment of the First Step Act and \nhave never been deemed legally invalid.\u201d  United \nStates Br. in Opp\u2019n at 11, Jackson v. United States, \nNo. 21-5875 (U.S. Feb. 2, 2022).  So, even if this Court \nwere to accept Petitioners\u2019 revision, they would still be \nineligible for relief.   \n\n21 \n \nB. Congress\u2019s Use of the Verb \u201cImposed\u201d \nReinforces the Fifth Circuit\u2019s Reading. \nOther textual clues bolster this conclusion.  For \none, \u00a7 403(b)\u2019s use of the verb \u201cimposed\u201d reinforces \n\u201cthe section\u2019s \u2018focus on the historical fact\u2019 of the \nsentence\u2019s imposition.\u201d  United States v. Carpenter, 80 \nF.4th 790, 791 (6th Cir. 2023) (Kethledge, J., joined by \nSutton, C.J., Thapar, and Bush, JJ., concurring in the \ndenial of rehearing en banc) (quoting Uriarte, 975 F.3d \nat 607 (Barrett, J., dissenting)).  Petitioners cannot \ndispute that the District Court \u201cimposed\u201d their initial \nsentences in 2010\u2014eight years before the First Step \nAct\u2019s passage.  The Act thus does not apply here. \nOnly that interpretation respects the plain \nmeaning of the statute\u2019s terms.  \u201c[I]n ordinary usage a \nsentence is \u2018imposed\u2019 when the district court \npronounces it.\u201d  Young v. United States, 943 F.3d 460, \n463 (D.C. Cir. 2019); see also Lott v. United States, 367 \nU.S. 421, 426 (1961) (observing that a \u201csentence is \nimposed\u201d by \u201cthe pronouncement of judgment\u201d).  And \nnothing that occurs later can erase that historical fact.  \n\u201cThat is why it is perfectly coherent to describe the \nprocedural posture of a case by saying, \u2018a sentence was \nimposed last year, but it has since been vacated on \nappeal.\u2019\u201d  Uriarte, 975 F.3d at 607 (Barrett, J., \ndissenting).   \nIndeed, this Court has frequently employed that \nvery construction to describe a vacated sentence.  For \ninstance, in Gregg v. Georgia, the plurality opinion \nexplained that \u201c[t]he death sentences imposed for \narmed robbery, however, were vacated.\u201d  428 U.S. 153, \n161-62 (1976) (emphases added).  And in Greenlaw v. \nUnited States, the Court said that, \u201c[i]n remanded \n\n22 \n \ncases,\u201d trial courts \u201chave imposed a sentence on the \nremaining counts longer than the sentence originally \nimposed on those particular counts.\u201d  554 U.S. 237, \n253 (2008) (emphases added).  These examples \nunderscore that in ordinary parlance, a vacated \nsentence is still a \u201csentence\u201d that has been \u201cimposed.\u201d   \nCongress has likewise used this construction \nthroughout the U.S. Code.  Its choice of language \nconsistently reflects the common-sense understanding \nthat even a legally invalid sentence is a \u201csentence\u201d \nthat has been \u201cimposed.\u201d  See, e.g., 18 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 3742(f)(1) (\u201cIf the court of appeals determines \nthat . . . the sentence was imposed in violation of law \nor imposed as a result of an incorrect application of the \nsentencing guidelines, the court shall remand the \ncase[.]\u201d); id. \u00a7 3742(a) (employing similar language).  \nIndeed, the federal habeas statute that Petitioners \ninvoked to vacate their \u00a7 924(c) conspiracy convictions \nemploys this formulation.  See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(a) (\u201cA \nprisoner . . . claiming the right to be released upon the \nground that the sentence was imposed in violation of \nthe Constitution or laws of the United States, or that \nthe court was without jurisdiction to impose such \nsentence, . . . may move the court which imposed the \nsentence to vacate . . . the sentence.\u201d).   \nHewitt fights this ordinary usage by suggesting \nthat \u201cimposed\u201d can also mean \u201c\u2018enforce\u2019\u201d or \u201c\u2018apply\u2019\u201d\u2014\nas in, \u201c[a] sentence is imposed on . . . an offender \nduring the entire duration of his or her incarceration.\u201d  \nHewitt.Br.28 (citation omitted).  But \u00a7 403(b) does not \nuse this \u201cimposed on\u201d structure.  Nor does it tether the \ninquiry to a sentence\u2019s effect on an \u201coffender\u201d in the \nfirst place.  It instead asks whether a sentence \u201cfor the \n\n23 \n \noffense\u201d has been imposed as of December 21, 2018.  \nFSA \u00a7 403(b).  That is undoubtedly the case for \nPetitioners\u2019 offenses.  The district judge imposed \u201ca \nsentence\u201d for those offenses \u201cas a matter of fact at a \nsingular point in time\u201d in 2010, and then imposed \nanother \nsentence \nfor \nthose \noffenses \nduring \nresentencing in 2012 (which remained in effect on the \ndate of the Act\u2019s enactment).  Hewitt.Br.28. \nDuffey and Ross, for their part, fail to muster any \ntextual \nbasis \nfor \nabandoning \nthis \nordinary \nunderstanding.  In fact, they acknowledge that \n\u201cCongress tied the application of Section 403(a) to \nwhether \n\u2018a \nsentence . . . has . . . been \nimposed,\u2019\u201d \nthereby using an admittedly \u201cbroad phrase that does \nnot \ndistinguish \nbetween \n\u2018original \nsentencing\u2019 \nproceedings \nand \n\u2018resentencing\u2019 \nproceedings.\u201d  \nDuffey.Br.31.  That is, any sentence counts as one that \nhas been imposed under the provision\u2019s plain text\u2014\nwhether \nimposed \nat \n\u201coriginal \nsentencing\u201d \nor \n\u201cresentencing.\u201d \nAs for the Government, it contends that this \nconstruction \u201cdisregards Congress\u2019s use of the passive \nvoice.\u201d  Gov.Br.29.  But that does not work either.  \n\u201cThe passive voice focuses on an event that occurs \nwithout respect to a specific actor\u201d\u2014here, the \nimposition of a sentence for the offense before the date \nof enactment.  Dean v. United States, 556 U.S. 568, \n572 \n(2009) \n(emphasis \nadded). \n \nThat \nevent \nundisputedly occurred here.  And the Government \nfails to explain how any actor other than a district \ncourt could have imposed such a sentence.  See \nBartenwerfer v. Buckley, 598 U.S. 69, 76 (2023) \n\n24 \n \n(\u201c[C]ontext can confine a passive-voice sentence to a \nlikely set of actors.\u201d).   \nSwitching gears, the Government argues that the \nFirst Step Act \u201cpresupposes that no sentence has \nalready been imposed\u201d because a \u201cdefendant cannot \nsimultaneously have two sentences for the same \ncrime.\u201d  Gov.Br.20 (emphasis added).  But that is \nirrelevant to whether \u201ca sentence\u201d has or \u201chas not been \nimposed\u201d at the relevant time.  And it misunderstands \nwhat happens with vacatur:  A sentence for the offense \nis imposed; that sentence for the offense is vacated; \nthen later, at resentencing, a new sentence for the \noffense is imposed.  There is nothing simultaneous \nabout those two sentences.  The Government\u2019s \nargument thus elides the key textual point, which is \nthat the District Court \u201cimposed\u201d \u201ca sentence\u201d for each \noffense before the \u201cdate of enactment.\u201d  That is an \nimmutable historical fact.  \u201cFor better or worse, it \nhappened, and nothing\u2014not even the sentence\u2019s later \nvacatur\u2014can erase the historical record.\u201d  Hernandez, \n107 F.4th at 971. \nC. Congress\u2019s Use of the Present-Perfect \nTense Confirms the Fifth Circuit\u2019s View. \nCongress\u2019s use of the present-perfect tense\u2014\u201chas \nnot been imposed\u201d\u2014further confirms its textual \u201cfocus \non the historical fact\u201d of sentencing.  Uriarte, 975 F.3d \nat 606-07 (Barrett, J., dissenting).  The present-\nperfect tense \u201cis formed by using have or has with the \nprincipal verb\u2019s past participle.\u201d  Chicago Manual of \nStyle, supra, \u00b6 5.132.  \u201cIt denotes an act, state, or \ncondition that is\u201d either \u201cnow completed or continues \nto the present.\u201d  Id. (emphasis added).  Here, the \nDistrict Court completed the act of imposing a \n\n25 \n \nsentence well before the date of enactment.  By that \npoint in December 2018, Petitioners were several \nyears into serving their imposed sentences.   \nPetitioners respond that Congress\u2019s use of the \npresent-perfect shows that the imposition of a \nsentence \nmust \n\u201ccontinue[] \ninto \nthe \npresent.\u201d  \nDuffey.Br.32-33; see Hewitt.Br.26.  But this argument \nfails because it ignores the more logical application of \nthe present-perfect tense.  As explained above, that \ntense \u201csometimes represents an action as having been \ncompleted at some indefinite time in the past.\u201d  \nGarner, supra, at 1082; see, e.g., Barrett v. United \nStates, 423 U.S. 212, 216 (1976) (observing that \nCongress\u2019s use of the present-perfect tense \u201cdenot[ed] \nan act that has been completed\u201d).  And that usage is \nmore fitting here.  \u201c[T]he act of imposing a sentence \ncould not possibly \u2018continue up to the present\u2019\u2014\nbecause the imposition of a sentence occurs at a fixed \npoint in time, when the district court \u2018states in open \ncourt the reasons for its imposition of the particular \nsentence.\u2019\u201d  Carpenter, 80 F.4th at 791 (Kethledge, J., \nconcurring) (alteration adopted) (quoting 18 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 3553(c)).  \nPetitioners\u2019 reading also conspicuously ignores the \nsecond half of \u00a7 403(b).  Rather than speak of a \nsentence that continues into the present, Congress \npegged the inquiry to a particular date by asking \nwhether a sentence for the relevant offense has or \u201chas \nnot been imposed as of [the Act\u2019s] date of enactment.\u201d  \nFSA \u00a7 403(b) (emphasis added).  \u201cBecause Congress \nwas creating law \u2018in real-time,\u2019 so to speak, \u00a7 403(b)\u2019s \nuse of the phrase \u2018as of [the] date of enactment\u2019 means, \nin effect, \u2018as of today,\u2019\u201d when we (Congress) enact this \n\n26 \n \nlaw.  Hernandez, 107 F.4th at 969.  Thus, on the date \nof the Act\u2019s passage, the full universe of defendants \nwho qualify under \u00a7 403(b) could be fully and easily \nascertained.  And Congress\u2019s header for \u00a7 403(b)\u2014\n\u201cAPPLICABILITY TO PENDING CASES\u201d\u2014reinforces that \nunderstanding of the statutory text.  See Dubin v. \nUnited States, 599 U.S. 110, 120-21 (2023) (\u201c\u2018[T]he title \nof a statute and the heading of a section\u2019 are \u2018tools \navailable for the resolution of a doubt\u2019 about the \nmeaning of a statute.\u2019\u201d (citation omitted)).  Petitioners\u2019 \ncases were not \u201cpending\u201d on the date of enactment. \nPetitioners and the Government nevertheless \nargue that if Congress wanted to include vacated \nsentences, it could have instead used the past-perfect \ntense\u2014\u201chad \nnot \nbeen \nimposed.\u201d \n \nGov.Br.17; \nDuffey.Br.32-34.  But, as Judge Newsom has \nexplained: \u201cThat substitution would have made a \nsyntactical hash of \u00a7 403(b), which then would have \nextended \u00a7 403(a)\u2019s modified stacking rule to pre-Act \nconvictions provided (with [the] \u2018as of today\u2019 \nparaphrase) that \u2018a sentence for the offense had not \nbeen imposed as of [today].\u2019\u201d  Hernandez, 107 F.4th at \n970 (second alteration in original).  That mixing of the \npast-perfect and present day makes no sense. \nThe Government digs up one example it believes is \nto the contrary from the Crime Control Act of 1990.  \nGov.Br.18.  But \u201c[i]t would hardly be surprising if [28] \nyears later, [\u00a7 403(b)\u2019s] drafters did not perfectly \nharmonize their [tense] usage\u201d with an unrelated \nstatute-of-limitations provision from three decades \nearlier.  Pulsifer, 601 U.S. at 151.  In fact, Congress \nhas since used the present-perfect tense in several \n\n27 \n \nother statute-of-limitations provisions.4  And, even \nmore relevant here, it has since used the present-\nperfect in a host of other contexts relating to pending \nactions.5  Congress\u2019s use of the present-perfect here is \nthus entirely consistent with how it has used that \ntense in other statutes, particularly when defining a \nstatute\u2019s applicability to cases pending at the time of \nenactment. \nFinally, even if Petitioners were right (which they \nare not) that the present-perfect tense here puts the \nfocus on a sentence\u2019s \u201ccontinuing\u201d effect, Hewitt.Br.13; \nDuffey.Br.32, they would still lose.  One of their own \ncases makes that clear.  In Lewis v. United States, a \n \n4  See, e.g., Pub. L. No. 111-147, \u00a7 513(d), 124 Stat. 71, 112 \n(2010) (applying amendments to \u201creturns filed on or before such \ndate [of enactment] if the period specified . . . for assessment of \nsuch taxes has not expired as of such date\u201d); Pub. L. No. 101-508, \n\u00a7 11317(c), 104 Stat. 1388, 1388-458 (1990) (similar). \n5  See INS v. Aguirre-Aguirre, 526 U.S. 415, 420 (1999) (\u201cThis \nprovision was made applicable to \u2018applications filed before, on, or \nafter\u2019 April 24, 1996, \u2018if final action has not been taken on them \nbefore such date.\u2019\u201d (emphasis added) (quoting AEDPA, Pub. L. No. \n104-132, \u00a7 413(g), 110 Stat. 1214, 1269-70 (1996))); Pub. L. No. \n104-208, \u00a7 2505, 110 Stat. 3009, 3009-469 (1996) (\u201cThe \namendments made by this subtitle shall be applicable with \nrespect to any claim that has not been finally adjudicated as of \nthe date of enactment of this Act.\u201d (emphasis added)); Pub. L. No. \n115-72, \u00a7 1005(c), 131 Stat. 1224, 1234 (2017) (\u201cThe amendments \nmade by this section shall apply to . . . any bankruptcy case . . . \nin which the plan . . . has not been confirmed on the date of \nenactment of this Act[.]\u201d (emphasis added)); Pub. L. No. 115-123, \n\u00a7 41108(d), 132 Stat. 64, 158-59 (2018) (\u201cThe amendments made \nby this section shall apply to information provided before, on, or \nafter the date of the enactment of this Act with respect to which \na final determination for an award has not been made before such \ndate of enactment.\u201d (emphasis added)). \n\n28 \n \ndefendant challenged his conviction under a prior \nfelon-in-possession statute, which made it unlawful \nfor \u201c[a]ny person who . . . has been convicted\u201d of a \nfelony to possess a firearm.  445 U.S. 55, 56 n.1 (1980) \n(emphasis added) (quoting 18 U.S.C. App. \u00a7 1202(a)).  \nThe defendant argued that the predicate state felony \nconviction was invalid because he had not been \nrepresented by counsel.  Id. at 57-58.  This Court \nassumed that the conviction was invalid and subject \nto vacatur, but it nevertheless rejected the defendant\u2019s \nargument.  See id. at 58-59, 64-65.  Concentrating on \nthe \u201clanguage of the statute itself,\u201d this Court \nexplained that the law\u2019s proscription was \u201cdirected \nunambiguously at any person who \u2018has been convicted \nby a court . . . of a felony.\u2019\u201d  Id. at 60.  \u201cNo modifier is \npresent, and nothing suggests any restriction on the \nscope of the term \u2018convicted.\u2019\u201d  Id.  That language is \n\u201csweeping, and its plain meaning is that the fact of the \nfelony conviction\u201d on the date of possession is all that \nmatters for imposing a firearm disability.  Id. at 61 \n(emphasis added).6   \n \n6  In dicta, the Court suggested that a conviction \u201cfinally \nreversed\u201d before the operative date of firearm possession might \nnot support a later felon-in-possession charge.  See Lewis, 445 \nU.S. at 61 n.5.  But the Court recognized that this did not honor \nthe statute\u2019s actual language and was based on an atextual, \n\u201ccommon-sense notion\u201d of what Congress intended for that \nparticular status-based offense.  Id.  The Court need not consider \nthat dicta here because Petitioners\u2019 \u201csentence[s]\u201d remained in \nplace as of the operative \u201cdate of enactment.\u201d  FSA \u00a7 403(b).  Also, \nthere is no reason to believe that Congress would treat vacated \nsentences the same way it treats a finally vacated conviction in a \nseparate, status-based law.  Only the latter bears on a \ndefendant\u2019s guilt (and therefore his status as a felon). \n\n29 \n \nThe same logic applies here, where the question is \nwhether \u201ca sentence for the offense has not been \nimposed as of [the First Step Act\u2019s] date of enactment.\u201d  \nFSA \u00a7 403(b).  Even under Petitioners\u2019 blinkered \ninterpretation, the focus is on the \u201cfact\u201d of whether the \nrelevant order\u2014in Lewis a conviction, and here a \nsentence\u2014\u201chas\u201d or \u201chas not\u201d been imposed as of that \nspecific date.  There is no question that a sentence has \nbeen imposed, as of that date, for each of the offenses \nat issue.  That is why Petitioners were incarcerated on \nDecember 21, 2018.    \nII. \nThe Legal Effect Of Vacatur Does Not Change \nThe Ordinary Meaning Of Section 403(b). \nLeft without a foothold in the statutory text, \nPetitioners urge this Court to abandon ordinary \nmeaning in favor of atextual considerations.  They \nsuggest that, \u201c[a]ccording to settled background \nprinciples, the law treats a vacated sentence as never \nhaving been pronounced,\u201d such that a vacated \nsentence should not be treated as \u201ca sentence\u201d at all.  \nHewitt.Br.16; see Duffey.Br.28.  But \u201c[t]his argument \nteeters on a contorted framing of contested general \nbackground principles rather than [\u00a7 403(b)\u2019s] text \nand context.\u201d  MOAC Mall Holdings LLC v. Transform \nHoldco LLC, 598 U.S. 288, 302 (2023).  It is therefore \nunpersuasive. \nA. A General Background Principle Cannot \nOverride Statutory Text. \nAs an initial matter, \u201ca background principle \ncannot overcome statutory text.\u201d  Uriarte, 975 F.3d at \n609 (Barrett, J., dissenting).  This Court has made \nthat point recently and repeatedly.  See, e.g., Corner \n\n30 \n \nPost, 144 S. Ct. at 2454; MOAC Mall Holdings, 598 \nU.S. at 301-02; Honeycutt v. United States, 581 U.S. \n443, 453 (2017); Mississippi ex rel. Hood v. AU \nOptronics Corp., 571 U.S. 161, 174-76 (2014).  And for \ngood reason:  To hold otherwise would ignore the \nspecific text that survived the legislative gauntlet in \nfavor of unexpressed principles that Congress has \nneither adopted nor endorsed.   \n\u201c[T]he best course, as always, is to stick with the \nordinary meaning of the text that actually applies.\u201d  \nCorner Post, 144 S. Ct. at 2454.  That means \u201cthe \nquestion in this case is not simply whether there exists \nsome background principle,\u201d Hood, 571 U.S. at 174, \nthat a \u201cvacated sentence, in the eyes of the law, was \nnever a sentence at all,\u201d Duffey.Br.3 (emphasis \nomitted).  Instead, \u201cthe question is whether Congress \nintended that courts engage\u201d in such historical fiction \nwhen interpreting the words \u201ca sentence.\u201d  Hood, 571 \nU.S. at 174.  There is no basis to think that Congress \ndid.  Its contrary \u201cintent is clear from the statutory \ntext.\u201d  Nat\u2019l Ass\u2019n of Mfrs. v. Dep\u2019t of Def., 583 U.S. 109, \n132 (2018).   \nIf anything, Petitioners\u2019 own cases refute their \ntheory.  They rely on precedents that tellingly \ncharacterize a vacated sentence as \u201ca sentence\u201d that \nhas been \u201cimposed.\u201d  In Pepper v. United States, for \ninstance, this Court said that the relevant \u201csentencing \nframework applies both at a defendant\u2019s initial \nsentencing and at any subsequent resentencing after \na sentence has been set aside on appeal.\u201d  562 U.S. 476, \n490 (2011) (emphasis added).  And in North Carolina \nv. Pearce, this Court explained that a defendant could \nconstitutionally \u201creceive a longer sentence than the \n\n31 \n \none originally imposed\u201d if convicted again on remand.  \n395 U.S. 711, 722 (1969) (emphasis added).  The First \nStep Act uses the same words in the same way, and \nthe \u201ctext of the statute controls this case.\u201d  Cochise \nConsultancy, Inc. v. United States ex rel. Hunt, 587 \nU.S. 262, 269 (2019). \nB. There \nIs \nNo \nUniversal \nBackground \nPrinciple that a Vacated Sentence Must Be \nDisregarded for All Purposes. \nEven if a background principle could override \nstatutory language (which it cannot), the Government \nitself concedes that it would \u201cbe incorrect to adopt any \ngeneral \u2018background legal principle[]\u2019 that \u2018vacatur \nmakes a sentence void from the start\u2019 for all purposes.\u201d  \nGov.Br.26 n.4.  The Government\u2019s view is correct. \n1. Petitioners\u2019 \nPurported \nBackground \nPrinciple Is Inconsistent with Related \nStatutory Provisions. \nAs a legal matter, a \u201ccomplete vacatur does not \nrequire the district court to proceed as if the initial \nsentencing never happened.\u201d  Uriarte, 975 F.3d at 608 \n(Barrett, J., dissenting).  Congress has in fact required \nthe opposite.  The Sentencing Reform Act\u2014which was \npassed before the First Step Act\u2014instructs that when \na sentence is vacated on appeal, the district court must \napply the Sentencing Guidelines \u201cthat were in effect \non the date of the previous sentencing of the defendant \nprior to the appeal.\u201d  18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(g)(1) (emphasis \nadded).  This sentencing statute therefore \u201cbelies \n[Petitioners\u2019] claim that Congress legislate[d] against \na background understanding\u201d in 2018 \u201cthat a vacatur \n\n32 \n \nerases the initial sentence for all purposes.\u201d  Uriarte, \n975 F.3d at 608-09 (Barrett, J., dissenting).   \nPetitioners would have this Court ignore that \nexpress statutory context.  Instead, they presume\u2014\nwith no basis in the statutory text\u2014that Congress \nsilently instructed district courts to \u201crecognize the fact \nof the defendant\u2019s prior sentence for purposes of \ndetermining his guidelines range (as required by \n\u00a7 3742(g)), but at the same time pretend that sentence \nnever happened for purposes of determining the \ndefendant\u2019s mandatory minimum.\u201d  Carpenter, 80 \nF.4th at 792 (Kethledge, J., concurring).  There is no \nreason to \u201cread \u00a7 403(b)\u2019s text to create such \nincongruity.\u201d  Duffey, 92 F.4th at 312.  \nIndeed, when Congress wants to exclude vacated \nsentences or convictions from a statute\u2019s reach, it \nknows how to do so.  For instance, the definitional \nsection that applies to \u00a7 924 provides that \u201c[a]ny \nconviction which has been expunged, or set aside or for \nwhich a person has been pardoned or has had civil \nrights restored shall not be considered a conviction for \npurposes of this chapter.\u201d  18 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(a)(20).  \nThrough \nthis \ndefinition, \nCongress \nspecifically \nexcluded vacated convictions from the meaning of \n\u201cconviction\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 924.  But it did not do the \nsame for vacated \u201csentences.\u201d  This indicates that \nCongress \nunderstood\u2014consistent \nwith \nordinary \nusage\u2014that a vacated conviction or sentence is still \u201ca \nconviction\u201d or \u201ca sentence.\u201d  But it treated the two \ndifferently, by including one while excluding the other.  \nThat is yet another contextual strike against \nPetitioners\u2019 contortion of \u00a7 403(b)\u2019s language.  See \nRussello v. United States, 464 U.S. 16, 23 (1983).  \n\n33 \n \n\u201cAtextual judicial supplementation is particularly \ninappropriate when, as here, Congress has shown that \nit knows how to adopt the omitted language or \nprovision.\u201d  Rotkiske v. Klemm, 589 U.S. 8, 14 (2019). \n2. A Vacated Order Remains Relevant in \nMany Contexts. \nThe historical fact of a vacated order often remains \nlegally relevant to the application of a statute in many \nother contexts.    \nFelon-In-Possession. \n \nAs \nthe \ngovernment \nobserves, convictions under \u00a7 922(g)(1) \u201cturn[] on the \nperson\u2019s status on the date he possesses a firearm, \neven if he subsequently succeeds in vacating the \npredicate conviction.\u201d  Gov.Br.26 n.4 (listing cases).  \nThat could not be so if the law \u201ctreats a vacated\u201d \nconviction \u201cas never having been pronounced.\u201d  \nHewitt.Br.16; see Duffey.Br.28.  If the conviction had \nnever been pronounced, then the federal defendant \nwould not have violated \u00a7 922(g)(1) on the day he \npossessed the firearm.  But such \u201cbelated success in \nvacating\u201d a conviction does not erase its reality from \nthe historical record.  United States v. Snyder, 235 \nF.3d 42, 53 (1st Cir. 2000); see United States v. Padilla, \n387 F.3d 1087, 1091 (9th Cir. 2004) (\u201c[T]he only \nrelevant circumstance for present purposes is [the \ndefendant\u2019s] status as a convicted felon at the time he \npossessed a firearm.  The state court\u2019s later order, \nnunc pro tunc or not, has no effect on that status.\u201d).  \nDouble Jeopardy.  The historical fact of a vacated \nconviction has relevance for double jeopardy purposes \ntoo.  Sometimes, a jury will render an inconsistent \nsplit verdict acquitting on some charges but convicting \non others.  See Bravo-Fernandez v. United States, 580 \n\n34 \n \nU.S. 5, 8 (2016).  And, sometimes, an appellate court \nwill vacate the convictions for \u201clegal error unrelated to \nthe inconsistency.\u201d  Id. at 18.  Before retrying the now-\nvacated convictions, a court must ask if the acquittals \nissue-preclude the retrial.  See id. at 20.  To do that, \nthe court must divine whether, by acquitting on some \ncharges, the \u201cjury actually decided that [the \ndefendant] did not violate\u201d the criminal statute.  Id.  A \ncourt in that position is free to consider the \u201cfact that \nthe jury convicted\u201d the defendant under that very \nstatute, even though that conviction was later \nvacated.  Id. (cleaned up); see also id. at 22 (\u201cA \nconviction that contradicts those acquittals is plainly \nrelevant to that determination, no less so simply \nbecause it is later overturned on appeal for unrelated \nlegal error[.]\u201d).  Far from a \u201clegal nullity,\u201d the \nhistorical fact of the vacated conviction can decide the \nissue-preclusion question.  See id. at 20-24.  It can also \ndictate how the defendant may be sentenced if \nconvicted again following a new trial.  Any time served \nfor a vacated conviction \u201cmust be fully \u2018credited\u2019 in \nimposing sentence upon a new conviction for the same \noffense.\u201d  Pearce, 395 U.S. at 718-19.   \nSex Offender Registration.  The Sex Offender \nRegistration and Notification Act likewise gives legal \neffect to the historical fact of conviction.  That statute \ndefines a \u201csex offender\u201d as anyone who \u201cwas convicted \nof a sex offense,\u201d 34 U.S.C. \u00a7 20911(1), and it \ncriminalizes failure to register with the appropriate \nsex-offender registry, see 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2250(a).  Courts \nhave held that the phrase \u201c\u2018was convicted\u2019 refers to the \nfact of conviction and does not refer just to a \u2018valid\u2019 \nconviction.\u201d  United States v. Roberson, 752 F.3d 517, \n522 (1st Cir. 2014).  If a later-vacated conviction \n\n35 \n \nfactually existed when the defendant failed to register, \nthen he is guilty of failing to register.  Id. \nFraud.  Similarly, lying about the existence of an \norder that is later vacated does not retroactively make \nthe statement true.  The lie can still be the basis for a \ncriminal fraud conviction.  See United States v. Miller, \n891 F.3d 1220, 1241 (10th Cir. 2018) (\u201cDefendant\u2019s \nlicense had indeed been suspended, and the vacatur of \nthe suspension order did not effectively remove it from \nhistorical existence and permit Defendant to state \nthat his license had never been suspended.\u201d).  \nImmigration.  Duffey and Ross concede that \nvacated convictions can also be relevant in the \nimmigration context.  Duffey.Br.24 n.12.  \u201cA vacatur \nor expungement obtained under a rehabilitative \nstatute, or granted simply in order to help the alien \navoid \u2018immigration hardships,\u2019 has no effect for \nimmigration law purposes.\u201d  Garces v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., \n611 F.3d 1337, 1344 (11th Cir. 2010) (citation \nomitted); see also, e.g., Sutherland v. Holder, 769 F.3d \n144, 146 (2d Cir. 2014).  Courts must still consider the \nvacated order.  \n* * * \nThese statutes and holdings confirm that \u201cvacatur \ndoes not erase [Petitioners\u2019] prior sentence[s] from \nhistory\u201d even as a legal matter.  United States v. \nJackson, 995 F.3d 522, 525 (6th Cir. 2021).  That is \nespecially true where, as here, the sentence for the \nrelevant offense is vacated \u201cfor unrelated legal error\u201d \non another offense.  Bravo-Fernandez, 580 U.S. at 22; \nsee also Garces, 611 F.3d at 1344.  There is no basis to \nconclude that Congress departed from the ordinary \n\n36 \n \nmeaning of \u201csentence\u201d in the First Step Act to exclude \nPetitioners\u2019 later-vacated sentences. \n3. Petitioners\u2019 Various Counterexamples \nAre Inapposite. \nAgainst this textual and contextual evidence, \nDuffey and Ross offer a number of examples that they \nsay establish their purported universal background \nprinciple.  But their examples all fail to support their \ntheory.  In fact, many contradict it. \nTheir criminal procedure examples all fall flat.  See \nDuffey.Br.18-19.  A defendant\u2019s rights to allocution, to \nbe present, and to be sentenced in open court during \nresentencing have nothing to do with vacatur.  They \nare instead\u2014as Duffey and Ross appear to recognize\u2014\ndictated by the text of various rules and statutes.  \nEach of those sources uses the term \u201csentence\u201d or \n\u201csentencing.\u201d  See Fed. R. Crim. P. 32(i)(4)(A) \n(allocution); Fed. R. Crim. P. 43(a)(3) (presence); 18 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c) (open court).  This shows that a \nsentence imposed during resentencing is \u201ca sentence.\u201d  \nBut it does not suggest the opposite about a sentence \nimposed during the initial sentencing proceedings. \nPetitioners\u2019 reliance on the Sentencing Guidelines \nonly harms their cause.  See Duffey.Br.22-23.  The \nSentencing Commission has stated that prior \nsentences \u201cresulting from convictions\u201d that \u201chave been \nreversed or vacated\u201d for certain reasons \u201care not to be \ncounted.\u201d  U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2 cmt. n.6 (emphasis added).  \nBut Petitioners\u2019 relevant convictions were never \nvacated, let alone for any of the reasons set forth in \nthe commentary.  And sentences resulting from \nconvictions that have been vacated \u201cfor reasons \nunrelated to innocence or errors of law,\u201d the \n\n37 \n \nSentencing Commission has said, \u201care to be counted.\u201d  \nId. \u00a7 4A1.2 cmt. n.10 (emphasis added).  That is, the \nhistorical \nfact \nof \nsentencing \nstill \nmatters, \nnotwithstanding the vacatur. \nPetitioners try to blur the distinction between \nvacatur of a conviction and vacatur of a sentence in \nother ways.  See Duffey.Br.20-25.  But this overlooks \nimportant differences between the two concepts.  For \ninstance, when a court vacates a conviction for an \noffense, the defendant \u201cmust be presumed innocent of \nthat charge.\u201d  Johnson v. Mississippi, 486 U.S. 578, \n585 (1988).  Accordingly, it sometimes makes sense to \ndisregard the conviction.  The same cannot be said \nwhen a sentence for the offense is vacated\u2014\nparticularly not where, as here, it is vacated for \nreasons \nunrelated \nto \nthe \nunderlying \noffense.  \nMoreover, many of Petitioners\u2019 own examples are \nthemselves riddled with exceptions, even for vacated \nconvictions.  See supra Section II.B.2.  This further \nundermines their professed background principle. \nThe concept of Munsingwear vacatur is even \nfurther afield.  See Duffey.Br.25; Hewitt.Br.20.  That \nequitable doctrine applies in \u201ccivil case[s]\u201d to \u201cclear[] \nthe path for future relitigation of the issues between \nthe parties\u201d where a case becomes moot before the \nlosing party can obtain meaningful appellate review.  \nUnited States v. Munsingwear, Inc., 340 U.S. 36, 40 \n(1950).  But it appears this Court \u201chas never applied \nMunsingwear in a criminal case.\u201d  United States v. \nTapia-Marquez, 361 F.3d 535, 538 (9th Cir. 2004); \naccord United States v. Silva, 2023 WL 3001570, at *3 \n(6th Cir. Apr. 19, 2023).  Nor would it make any sense \nin the sentencing context, where issues become moot, \n\n38 \n \nfor example, because a sentence has expired or the \ndefendant has passed away.  See United States v. \nSampson, 26 F.4th 514, 516 (1st Cir. 2022).  \nMunsingwear thus provides no support for the notion \nthat the phrase \u201ca sentence for the offense\u201d excludes a \nlater-vacated sentence.  \nPetitioners also fumble for support in cases and \nhistorical sources as far back as the 1400s.  \nDuffey.Br.26-28; Hewitt.Br.18-21.  But statutory \ninterpretation seeks to discern the \u201cordinary meaning\u201d \nof the text \u201cat the time Congress enacted the statute.\u201d  \nWis. Cent. Ltd., 585 U.S. at 277 (emphasis added; \ncitation omitted).  Petitioners never explain how these \nhistorical sources \u201clong predat[ing]\u201d the First Step \nAct\u2019s passage in 2018 might \u201cilluminate the scope\u201d of \nthe law\u2019s text.  N.Y. State Rifle & Pistol Ass\u2019n v. Bruen, \n597 U.S. 1, 34 (2022).  Nor is there any reason to \nbelieve that members of the 115th Congress (not to \nmention the American people) were even aware of \nthese decisions from lower courts and the Queen\u2019s \nBench, let alone that \u00a7 403(b) silently incorporated \nsome supposed background principle from them.  \nIndeed, with the exception of Pepper, Petitioners\u2019 \ndetours through history fail to uncover a single \nvacatur case that arose in the resentencing context.  \nSee Duffey.Br.17, 26-28, Hewitt.Br.18-21.7  And as \nalready demonstrated, by 2018, the historical fact of a \nprior vacated order was relevant in that context and \n \n7  Duffey and Ross\u2019s lead case, Miller v. Aderhold, 288 U.S. 206 \n(1933), was not even a vacatur case.  The trial court there lacked \nauthority to issue its permanently suspended sentence, so \nnothing prevented it from rendering an actual sentence at the \nsucceeding term.  See id. at 209-11. \n\n39 \n \nmany others.  Petitioners\u2019 reliance on historical \nsources is thus simply misplaced. \nThat leaves Petitioners to hang their interpretive \nhat on Pepper.  They note that this Court there said \nthat vacatur \u201ceffectively wiped the slate clean\u201d for \npurposes of the law-of-the-case doctrine.  Duffey.Br.18 \n(quoting Pepper, 562 U.S. at 507).  This, they say, \nmeans that each of their prior sentences \u201cwas null and \nvoid from the start\u201d and \u201cnever a sentence at all.\u201d  \nDuffey.Br.3; see Hewitt.Br.20-21.  That reasoning \nimpermissibly \u201cgives technical legal effect to a figure \nof speech.\u201d  Carpenter, 80 F.4th at 792 (Kethledge, J., \nconcurring).  Vacatur \u201cwipes the slate clean insofar as \nthe defendant will be sentenced anew.\u201d  Uriarte, 975 \nF.3d at 608 (Barrett, J., dissenting).  But even Pepper \nrecognized that a later-vacated sentence is \u201ca \nsentence.\u201d  562 U.S. at 490.  Thus, Pepper does not \ncome anywhere close to creating a \u201csufficiently well \nestablished\u201d background principle that a vacated \nsentence was never \u201ca sentence\u201d at all.  Pasquantino \nv. United States, 544 U.S. 349, 368 (2005).   \nC. The Federal Saving Statute Forecloses \nPetitioners\u2019 Position. \nRegardless, even if there were a universal \nbackground principle that vacatur prohibits courts \nfrom looking at the historical fact of a sentence\u2019s \nimposition, Petitioners\u2019 theory would still fail.  That is \nbecause \nCongress \nhas \nexpressly \nadopted \na \ncountervailing background principle.  The federal \nsaving statute provides that \u201c[t]he repeal of any \nstatute shall not have the effect to release or \nextinguish any penalty, forfeiture, or liability incurred \nunder such statute, unless the repealing act shall so \n\n40 \n \nexpressly provide.\u201d  1 U.S.C. \u00a7 109 (emphasis added).  \n\u201c[T]he word \u2018repeal\u2019 applies when a new statute simply \ndiminishes the penalties that the older statute set \nforth.\u201d  Dorsey v. United States, 567 U.S. 260, 272 \n(2012).  That is how Petitioners attempt to read the \nFirst Step Act\u2014to retroactively authorize reduced \npenalties nearly two decades after they \u201ccommit[ted] \nthe underlying conduct that ma[de] [them] liable.\u201d  Id. \nGiven \nthe \nfederal \nsaving \nstatute\u2019s \nexpress \nlanguage, though, courts \u201cmust assume that Congress \ndid not intend those [new] penalties to apply unless it \nclearly indicated to the contrary.\u201d  Id. at 265 (second \nemphasis added).  \u201cCongress is well aware of [this] \nbackground principle when it enacts new criminal \nstatutes.\u201d  Id. at 274.  But Petitioners would have this \nCourt replace that express (and duly enacted) \nstatutory background principle with an unexpressed \n(and contested) one.  And they would do so in order to \nthwart the ordinary meaning of the law.  That gets the \ninterpretive task precisely backwards.   \nDuffey and Ross retort that the First Step Act \n\u201cclearly abrogates Section 109\u2019s interpretive principle\u201d \nbecause \u201cSection 403 applies at least to initial \nsentencing.\u201d  Duffey.Br.46; see also Gov.Br.24 \n(observing that \u00a7 403 applies \u201cto at least some prior \noffenders\u201d).  But that is beside the point.  Petitioners \nare seeking to apply the Act retroactively to their \nresentencing.  Accordingly, the question remains \n\u201cwhether Congress has clearly indicated that the Act \nshould apply\u201d retroactively when a defendant is \nresentenced for an offense after the date of enactment.  \nCarpenter, 80 F.4th at 791 (Kethledge, J., concurring).  \nIt clearly has not.  \n\n41 \n \nIII. \nPetitioners\u2019 \nAnd \nThe \nGovernment\u2019s \nRemaining Arguments Are Unpersuasive. \n\u201cUnable to anchor [their] preferred reading in the \nstatutory text,\u201d Petitioners and the Government \n\u201cseek[] refuge in a litany\u201d of other \u201cextratextual \nconsiderations.\u201d  Nat\u2019l Ass\u2019n of Mfrs., 583 U.S. at 129.  \nThey rely on drafting history, a statutory title, general \nfloor statements, purported notions of congressional \npurpose, and the rule of lenity.  But those \nconsiderations \u201cprovide no basis to depart from the \nstatute\u2019s plain language.\u201d  Id. \nA. The \nDrafting \nHistory \nCuts \nAgainst \nPetitioners\u2019 Interpretation. \nDuffey and Ross rely on drafting history that \nactually disproves their argument.  They note that \n\u201c[e]arlier versions of the First Step Act would have \nmade Section 403 fully retroactive.\u201d  Duffey.Br.37.  \nFrom this, they insist that \u201cCongress intended to cover \nthe waterfront of all Section 924(c) cases\u2014\u2018pending\u2019 \nand \u2018past.\u2019\u201d  Duffey.Br.38.   \nThat \nfundamentally \nmisunderstands \nthe \nlegislative process.  \u201cFew principles of statutory \nconstruction are more compelling than the proposition \nthat Congress does not intend sub silentio to enact \nstatutory language that it has earlier discarded in \nfavor of other language.\u201d  INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca, 480 \nU.S. 421, 442-43 (1987) (citation omitted).  Congress \nultimately decided not to apply \u00a7 403 to \u201cpast\u201d cases \nlike Petitioners\u2019, in which \u201ca sentence for the offense \nhas . . . been imposed as of [the] date of enactment.\u201d  \nFSA \u00a7 403(b).  This Court cannot expand the statute \n\n42 \n \nto cover situations that Congress conspicuously left \nout. \nB. Section 403\u2019s Title Does Not Bear on the \nStatutory Text. \nDuffey and Ross also latch onto Congress\u2019s labeling \nof \u00a7 403 as a \u201cclarification.\u201d  They claim this \u201cindicates \nthat Congress always intended Section 924(c) to \nprohibit \nthe \nstacking \nof \nenhanced \nmandatory \nminimums for first-time offenders\u201d and \u201cnever \nintended the result reached in Deal.\u201d  Duffey.Br.41-42.  \nBut that is neither true nor relevant. \nIt is not true, because the 115th Congress that \npassed the First Step Act cannot speak to the intent of \nthe \n90th \nCongress \nthat \npassed \nthe \noriginal \nmandatory-minimum provisions 50 years earlier.  See \nPub. L. No. 90-618, \u00a7 102, 82 Stat. 1213, 1224 (1968).  \nNor can it speak to the intent of any of the 24 \nCongresses in between that left the original language \nin place, even as they otherwise amended \u00a7 924(c) in \nDeal\u2019s wake.  See, e.g., Pub. L. No. 105-386, \u00a7 1 (1998).  \nThose amendments, if anything, suggest that previous \nCongresses did agree with the result in Deal.  See \nLamar, Archer & Cofrin, LLP v. Appling, 584 U.S. 709, \n722 (2018) (\u201cCongress is presumed to be aware\u201d of a \n\u201cjudicial interpretation of a statute and to adopt that \ninterpretation when it re-enacts a statute without \nchange.\u201d (citation omitted)). \nThe \u201cclarification\u201d title is also irrelevant because \nCongress\u2019s \u201cclarification\u201d was to the substantive scope \n\u201cof \nSection \n924(c) \nof \nTitle \n18,\u201d \nFSA \n\u00a7 403 \n(capitalization \naltered), \nnot \nto \nthe \nscope \nof \nretroactivity.  Congress\u2019s choice of title merely \nconfirms that it intended to abrogate Deal, which is a \n\n43 \n \npoint that nobody disputes.  In all events, \u201ca title or \nheading should never be allowed to override the plain \nwords of a text.\u201d  Scalia & Garner, supra, at 222; see, \ne.g., Pa. Dep\u2019t of Corrs. v. Yeskey, 524 U.S. 206, 212 \n(1998).  As already explained, Petitioners find no \nsupport in the actual text of \u00a7 403(b).  If anything, the \nrelevant heading is \u00a7 403(b)\u2019s, which indicates that the \nprovision addresses \u201cpending cases.\u201d  Petitioners\u2019 \ncases were not \u201cpending\u201d on the date of enactment.  \nThey were closed, and Petitioners were serving \nsentences imposed years earlier. \nC. The Legislative History Does Not Support \nPetitioners\u2019 Interpretation. \nPetitioners and the Government also invoke a \nsmattering of legislative history to muddle the text.  In \nfact, the Government (tellingly) leads its entire \nargument with legislative history.  Gov.Br.14-15.  But \n\u201clegislative history is not the law,\u201d and so no amount \nof it can override statutory language.  Azar v. Allina \nHealth Servs., 587 U.S. 566, 579 (2019) (citation \nomitted).  Only that final text has survived the \u201csingle, \nfinely \nwrought \nand \nexhaustively \nconsidere[d] \nprocedure\u201d that our Constitution demands for \nlegislation.  INS v. Chadha, 462 U.S. 919, 951 (1983).   \nBesides, \u201cscattered floor statements by individual \nlawmakers\u201d\u2014which Petitioners and the Government \nrely on\u2014are \u201c\u2018among the least illuminating forms of \nlegislative history.\u2019\u201d  Advocate Health Care Network v. \nStapleton, 581 U.S. 468, 481 (2017) (citation omitted).  \nThat is particularly true here, where Petitioners and \nthe Government rummage for support in generalized \nstatements that have nothing to do with the question \npresented. \n \nSee \nGov.Br.14-15; \nDuffey.Br.39-40; \n\n44 \n \nHewitt.Br.31.

Rec. \nS7775 (daily ed. Dec. 18, 2018) (Sen. Cardin).  \nPetitioners were \u201cindividuals currently incarcerated\u201d \nat the time of enactment and for many years both \nbefore and after that\u2014including at the time of \nresentencing and up through this day.  See 18 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 3143(a)-(b); United States v. Olis, 450 F.3d 583, 587 \n(5th Cir. 2006). \nD. Petitioners\u2019 Appeals to Statutory Purpose \nCannot Salvage Their Atextual Reading. \nPetitioners and the Government next \u201cretreat[] to \nthat last redoubt of losing causes,\u201d contending that \n\u201cthe statute at hand should be liberally construed to \nachieve its purposes.\u201d  Director, Office of Workers\u2019 \nComp.

That \n\u201coverrid[ing]\u201d purpose, they say, is to promote \u201cthe \nfairness of broadly applying the First Step Act\u2019s \nreduced penalties.\u201d  Gov.Br.23. \nBut the \u201cglitch in this argument is of course the \ntext\u201d of the statute Congress enacted.  NLRB v.

Santander Consumer USA Inc., 582 \nU.S. 79, 89 (2017) (citation omitted).  \u201c[N]o law \npursues its purposes at all costs.\u201d  Luna Perez v. \nSturgis Pub. Sch., 598 U.S. 142, 150 (2023) \n(alterations adopted; citation omitted).  The First Step \nAct is no exception.  See Pulsifer, 601 U.S. at 152.  All \nagree that Congress did not afford retroactive \u201crelief \nto all defendants, but only to some.\u201d  Id.  \u201cAnd to \ndetermine the exact contours of that class, [this Court] \ncan do no better than examine [\u00a7 403(b)\u2019s] text in \ncontext.\u201d  Id.  That text in context dooms Petitioners\u2019 \nclaim. \nThe Government and Hewitt likewise submit that \n\u201cno sound reason exists\u201d as a policy matter for denying \nretroactive relief to defendants with later-vacated \nsentences.  Gov.Br.26; see Hewitt.Br.34.  But that \nmisunderstands this Court\u2019s interpretive task.  \u201cPolicy \narguments are properly addressed to Congress, not \nthis Court.\u201d  SAS Inst., Inc. v. Iancu, 584 U.S. 357, 368 \n(2018).  And this Court has repeatedly explained that \n\u201c\u2018even the most formidable\u2019 policy arguments cannot \n\u2018overcome\u2019 a clear statutory directive.\u201d  BP P.L.C. v. \nMayor & City Council of Baltimore, 593 U.S. 230, 245 \n(2021) (quoting Kloeckner v. Solis, 568 U.S. 41, 56 n.4 \n(2012)).  \u201cIf courts felt free to pave over bumpy \nstatutory texts in the name of more expeditiously \nadvancing a policy goal, [they] would risk failing to \n\u2018take account of\u2019 legislative compromises essential to a \nlaw\u2019s passage and, in that way, thwart rather than \nhonor \u2018the effectuation of congressional intent.\u2019\u201d  New \n\n46 \n \nPrime Inc. v. Oliveira, 586 U.S. 105, 120-21 (2019) \n(alterations adopted; citation omitted). \nIn any event, there are sound reasons for Congress \ndrawing the line where it did.  For starters, it is a clear \nrule that can be easily applied from the date of \nenactment onward\u2014which the text itself indicates \nwas Congress\u2019s goal.  Also, accepting Petitioners\u2019 \ncontrary argument would invite unfairness of its own.  \nFor instance, it would illogically \u201cfavor defendants \nwhose appeals\u2014for whatever reason\u2014took longer to \nresolve.\u201d  United States v. Hodges, 948 F.3d 160, 164 \n(3d Cir. 2020).  An example offered by the Third \nCircuit illustrates the point: \nImagine two \u00a7 924(c) defendants sentenced \nbefore the First Step Act who successfully \nappeal their sentences.  Suppose the first \ndefendant homes-in on a single dispositive \nissue, allowing vacatur and resentencing before \nthe First Step Act\u2019s passage.  But suppose the \nsecond defendant complicates his appeal with \nmultiple yet non-meritorious issues, delaying \nresentencing until after the First Step Act \npasses.  The first defendant would not benefit \nfrom the new mandatory minimum, but the \nsecond defendant would.  \nId.  Petitioners\u2019 reading would also reward criminal \ndefendants who might have \u201cdelayed the [district] \ncourt with continuances.\u201d  Uriarte, 975 F.3d at 610 \n(Barrett, J., dissenting).  And it would amplify the risk \nthat co-defendants\u2014who are usually sentenced at \nsimilar times\u2014will receive large disparities in \npunishment based on the timing quirks of later \nappellate and habeas proceedings.  See id.   \n\n47 \n \nThis case itself provides another example of why it \nmade sense for Congress to draw the line where it did.  \nPetitioners\u2019 sentences were vacated for reasons that \nhad nothing to do with the \u00a7 924(c) offenses at issue.  \nConsequently, Petitioners were resentenced only \nbecause they committed more dangerous behavior.  \nHad they not conspired with one another to commit \narmed bank robbery and instead acted alone, they \nwould have never been resentenced.  Applying the \nFirst Step Act\u2019s modified mandatory-minimum rules \nretroactively to Petitioners\u2019 cases would thus provide \npreferential treatment to them over otherwise \nsimilarly situated individuals who committed fewer, \nless dangerous crimes.  Cf. Iannelli v. United States, \n420 U.S. 770, 778 (1975) (\u201cThis Court repeatedly has \nrecognized that a conspiracy poses distinct dangers \nquite apart from those of the substantive offense.\u201d).8 \nOf course, the text of the law, not these policy \nconcerns, controls the analysis.  But Petitioners\u2019 and \nthe Government\u2019s policy arguments fail even on their \nown terms.  And these sorts of \u201cdisparities, reflecting \na line-drawing effort, will exist whenever Congress \n \n8  Duffey and Ross also suggest that the Fifth Circuit\u2019s reading \nwould produce \u201cextreme results\u201d in a hypothetical case where a \ndefendant secured a new trial on appeal before the First Step \nAct\u2019s passage.  Duffey.Br.50 (capitalization altered).  But \u201cthis \nCourt\u2019s task is to discern and apply the law\u2019s plain meaning as \nfaithfully as [it] can, not \u2018to assess the consequences of each \napproach and adopt the one that produces the least mischief.\u2019\u201d  \nBP, 593 U.S. at 246 (citation omitted).  Nor is it \u201cstrange,\u201d as \nDuffey and Ross maintain, Duffey.Br.51, to resentence a criminal \ndefendant consistent with how other offenders who committed \nthe same crimes on the same dates and received their sentences \nat the same time as the defendant\u2019s initial sentence. \n\n48 \n \nenacts a new law changing sentences.\u201d  Dorsey, 567 \nU.S. at 280.  That is all the more reason to heed the \nFirst Step Act\u2019s text and \u201cthe limits up to which \nCongress was prepared to go.\u201d  New Prime, 586 U.S. \nat 121 (quotation marks omitted).  Congress chose to \ndraw the line at the imposition of a sentence for the \noffense by the date of enactment. \nE. The Rule of Lenity Does Not Apply. \nFinally, Petitioners invoke the rule of lenity.  \nDuffey.Br.42-44; \nHewitt.Br.35-37. \n \nBut \nthat \nsubstantive canon \u201capplies only when a criminal \nstatute contains a \u2018grievous ambiguity or uncertainty,\u2019 \nand \u2018only if, after seizing everything from which aid \ncan be derived,\u2019 the Court \u2018can make no more than a \nguess as to what Congress intended.\u2019\u201d  Ocasio v. \nUnited States, 578 U.S. 282, 295 n.8 (2016) (citation \nomitted).  For the reasons already explained, there is \nno ambiguity\u2014let alone a grievous ambiguity\u2014in this \ncase. \nEven if there were, lenity would still play no role.  \nThe rule of lenity exists \u201cto ensure both that there is \nfair warning of the boundaries of criminal conduct and \nthat legislatures, not courts, define criminal liability.\u201d  \nCrandon v. United States, 494 U.S. 152, 158 (1990).  \nBut, \u201cin the sentencing context,\u201d these theoretical \njustifications \u201care weak at best.\u201d  Phillip M. Spector, \nThe Sentencing Rule of Lenity, 33 U. Tol. L. Rev. 511, \n514 (2002).  They are even weaker insofar as the \nretroactivity of a sentencing provision is concerned\u2014\nfor two critical reasons.   \nFirst, there are no \u201cfair warning\u201d concerns here.  \nCrandon, 494 U.S. at 158.  When the Scarecrow \nBandits committed their string of armed bank \n\n49 \n \nrobberies in 2008, the mandatory minimums that \nPetitioners would face for their \u00a7 924(c) offenses were \nwell established.  See Deal, 508 U.S. at 137.  Thus, to \nthe extent Petitioners considered their potential \npunishments when deciding to commit their many \nbank robberies, they would have expected to face the \nvery sentences they both initially and ultimately \nreceived. \nSecond, construing the retroactive scope of a \nsentencing law broadly in favor of defendants does not \npromote the separation of powers.  It thwarts it.  As \nexplained above, Congress \u201cis well aware of the \nbackground principle\u201d that \u201cbefore interpreting a new \ncriminal statute to apply its new penalties to a set of \npre-Act offenders,\u201d courts will \u201cassure themselves that \nordinary interpretive considerations point clearly in \nthat direction.\u201d  Dorsey, 567 U.S. at 274-75 (emphasis \nadded).  That principle is the result of Congress\u2019s own \noverarching command that modifications to penal \nstatutes will not be construed retroactively unless \nthey \u201cso expressly provide.\u201d  1 U.S.C. \u00a7 109.  Applying \nthe rule of lenity would flip that statutory \npresumption on its head and disrespect Congress\u2019s \ninstructions.  The federal saving statute\u2019s text \u201cserves \nto remove the ambiguity that is a necessary \nprecondition to invocation of the rule.\u201d  Dorsey, 567 \nU.S. at 296 (Scalia, J., dissenting).  And lenity cannot \ncountermand that congressional direction. \n*   *   * \nIn the end, \u201conly the words on the page constitute \nthe law adopted by Congress and approved by the \nPresident.\u201d  Bostock v. Clayton County, 590 U.S. 644, \n654 (2020).  The decision below faithfully applied that \n\n50 \n \nlaw by adhering to \u00a7 403(b)\u2019s plain text.  \u201cIf Congress \nenacted into law something different from what it \nintended,\u201d then it can of course \u201camend the statute to \nconform it to its intent.\u201d  Lamie v. U.S. Trustee, 540 \nU.S. 526, 542 (2004).  Or if the Executive believes it \nwould be more \u201cfair[]\u201d to reduce Petitioners\u2019 sentences, \nGov.Br.26, it can utilize the pardon power to commute \nthose sentences, see U.S. Const. art. II, \u00a7 2, cl. 1.  But \nthis Court\u2019s role is \u201cto apply, not amend, the work of \nthe People\u2019s representatives.\u201d  Henson, 582 U.S. at 90.  \nPetitioners were initially sentenced for the offenses at \nissue in 2010.  They were resentenced for those \noffenses in 2012.  And they were serving those \nsentences when Congress enacted the First Step Act \nmore than six years later, on December 21, 2018.  The \nfact that they later received a third go-round for \nresentencing does not mean that \u201ca sentence for the \noffense has not been imposed as of such date of \nenactment.\u201d  FSA \u00a7 403(b).  As a result, Petitioners are \nineligible for retroactive application of the First Step \nAct\u2019s modified mandatory-minimum rules. \n \n \n\n51 \n \nCONCLUSION \nThis Court should affirm the judgment below. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    Respectfully submitted, \nCLARE PUTNAM POZOS \nBRIAN A.

          "task_beliefs": "This observation was an internal strategic reassessment, not an acquisition of new external evidence. Therefore, my substantive understanding of the case's legal arguments remains unchanged, but my plan to resolve my critical knowledge gaps has been fundamentally redirected.\n\n*   **Petitioner's Position (Stable):** My model of the petitioner's argument remains the most solid part of my analysis. The argument centers on the principle that a vacated sentence is legally void (*de novo* resentencing), requiring the application of the law in effect at the time of the new sentencing hearing\u2014namely, the First Step Act. This position is buttressed by the rule of lenity.\n\n*   **Opposing Position (Critically Incomplete):** The void in my knowledge concerning the counterargument remains absolute. I have still not found any substantive legal reasoning, precedent, or statutory interpretation that supports the Fifth Circuit's decision to deny the application of the First Step Act. This remains the single most important gap in my task-level model.\n\n*   **U.S. Government's Position (Complicated and Unchanged):** My understanding of the government's stance is frozen in a state of contradiction. The initial case summary suggested a confession of error, but the discovery of a \"BRIEF FOR THE UNITED STATES IN OPPOSITION\" filed by the Solicitor General on May 29, 2024, directly challenges that simple narrative. The substance of this opposition is unknown and represents a major source of uncertainty.\n\n*   **Current State of Uncertainty (Stable but Reframed):** My uncertainty is still profound, centered on the unknown arguments of the court-appointed amicus and the U.S. government. However, this observation has reframed the problem. I am no longer just uncertain about the *content* of their arguments; I have now concluded that my *method* for finding them was flawed. My immediate task-level goal is no longer to search for the briefs themselves, but to first acquire the case's docket sheet. This document is now the key that I believe will unlock the map of all filings and finally allow me to target the missing arguments.",
          "design_beliefs": "This observation marks a crucial pivot in my methodology, driven by a formal diagnosis of tool failure. It represents a shift from tactical adjustments (changing keywords) to strategic re-evaluation (changing the information target and search methodology).\n\n**Core Principles (Reinforced):**\n*   **Model the Adversarial Process (Reinforced and Re-strategized):** My repeated inability to find the counterarguments has powerfully reinforced the need to model the full conflict. This observation crystallizes the realization that I cannot build this model by searching for its components piecemeal with a faulty tool. The new strategy\u2014to acquire the docket sheet first\u2014is a direct and more robust attempt to fulfill this core principle by first mapping the entire landscape of filings before trying to read them.\n\n**Applied Principles & Heuristics (Critique and Refinement):**\n*   **\"Failed Search as a Signal\" Heuristic (Successfully Applied to its Conclusion):** This heuristic has proven to be my most valuable navigational tool. Its application has evolved through three stages:\n    1.  Signal 1 led to a tactical change: \"Refine search query.\"\n    2.  Signal 2 led to a strategic change: \"Target a different opponent (the government).\"\n    3.  Signal 3 (and the subsequent `THINK` action) led to a methodological conclusion: \"The search tool itself is the primary problem.\" This successful escalation demonstrates the heuristic's power in diagnosing deep-seated issues.\n\n*   **\"Tool Limitation Assessment\" (Formulated and Validated):** This has now been elevated from an emerging idea to a core, explicit heuristic. My working diagnosis is that the `closed_search` on `docket_files` tool is fundamentally incapable of full-text retrieval of primary briefs, indexing only metadata and ancillary documents. The current action plan is designed specifically to test this hypothesis. This represents a significant maturation of my process: I am now actively diagnosing and testing the limits of my environment.\n\n*   **The \"Search Granularity Ladder\" Heuristic (Demoted):** I now assess this heuristic as a lower-level tactic, only effective when the suitability of the primary search tool has been confirmed. Its repeated failure in this instance shows its inadequacy for overcoming fundamental tool limitations.\n\n**Emerging Heuristics / Next Steps (Promoted to Active Strategy):**\n*   **\"Search the Docket Entries, Not Just the Files\" (Promoted to Top Priority):** This is no longer a future idea; it is my current, active strategy. The `THINK` action was the formal decision to execute this pivot. I now believe that the docket sheet is the most valuable piece of information I can acquire, as it provides the \"table of contents\" for the entire case, which is a prerequisite for any further substantive analysis. A successful search will provide immense task-level gain (\u03b8), while failure will provide crucial design-level gain (D) by confirming my hypothesis about my tool's limitations."

I have discovered the central counterargument from the court-appointed amicus, which is a strong textualist reading of Section 403(b) of the First Step Act. The conflict is now clear: it's the petitioner's reliance on the legal principle of de novo resentencing versus the amicus's plain-text historical test. The amicus's argument seems potent and well-suited for the current Court. My prediction has flipped to favor the amicus (affirming the judgment below). However, to solidify this prediction, I must find the petitioner's response to this specific textualist argument. The most direct way to do this is to find the petitioner's reply brief. My previous 'failed' search serendipitously revealed an 'Affidavit of Service' (Document 21) that explicitly names the 'REPLY BRIEF FOR PETITIONERS'. This is my next target. Finding this document will provide the highest possible information gain for \u03b8, as it will contain the direct rebuttal to the argument I now believe is most likely to persuade the Court. It will also further validate my new D-level heuristic of using service documents to map case filings.",

          "task_beliefs": "This observation has catastrophically collapsed my uncertainty and fundamentally reshaped my model of the case. The critical knowledge gap that has plagued my analysis\u2014the substance of the argument against the petitioner\u2014has been filled.\n\n*   **Petitioner's Position (Stable):** My understanding of the petitioner's argument remains unchanged. It rests on the principle of *de novo* resentencing: a vacated sentence is a legal nullity, meaning that for legal purposes, no sentence existed. Therefore, the law in effect at the time of the new sentencing hearing, the First Step Act, must apply. This argument is supported by the rule of lenity.\n\n*   **Opposing Position (Discovered and Modeled):** I have acquired the \"BRIEF FOR COURT-APPOINTED AMICUS CURIAE IN SUPPORT OF THE JUDGMENT BELOW\" (Document 16). This document provides the complete counterargument, which I was previously unable to find. The amicus, Michael H. McGinley, was appointed by the Court to defend the lower court's judgment after the government switched sides. The core of the amicus argument is a strict textualist interpretation of the First Step Act's Section 403(b):\n    *   **The Historical Test:** The statute's applicability hinges on whether \"a sentence for the offense **has not been imposed as of such date of enactment**\" (Dec. 21, 2018).\n    *   **Plain Meaning:** The amicus argues this language creates a simple historical inquiry. As a matter of historical fact, a sentence *was* imposed on Hewitt in 2010 and 2012. The subsequent vacatur of that sentence does not erase the historical fact that it *had been imposed* as of the 2018 enactment date.\n    *   **Textual Deconstruction:** The argument emphasizes that Congress used the indefinite article \"a sentence\" (not \"a final, valid sentence\") and the past-perfect tense \"has...been imposed\" to refer to a historical event, anchored to a specific point in time (\"as of such date of enactment\").\n    *   **Rejection of Legal Fiction:** The amicus directly attacks the petitioner's reliance on the principle of vacatur, arguing that a \"general background principle cannot override statutory text.\" The brief cites legal contexts where a vacated sentence or conviction retains legal significance, arguing it is not a \"universal principle.\"\n    *   **Federal Saving Statute (1 U.S.C. \u00a7 109):** The amicus invokes this statute to argue against the retroactive application of the First Step Act's reduced penalties, asserting it creates a presumption against such retroactivity that the petitioner cannot overcome.\n\n*   **U.S. Government's Position (Clarified):** The discovery of a \"CERTIFICATE OF SERVICE\" for the \"BRIEF FOR RESPONDENT SUPPORTING PETITIONERS\" (Document 20), filed by the Solicitor General, definitively confirms that the government is, in fact, supporting the petitioner's position. My previous confusion stemmed from an earlier filing at the certiorari stage. The adversarial structure is now clear: it is **Petitioner & U.S. Government vs. Court-Appointed Amicus**.\n\n*   **Current State of Uncertainty (Dramatically Reduced, Prediction Flipped):** My uncertainty has shifted from \"what is the counterargument?\" to \"which of these two arguments will the Court find more persuasive?\" The amicus's textualist argument is potent and appears well-aligned with the current Court's jurisprudential leanings. The central conflict is now a clash between a legal principle/fiction (*de novo* resentencing) and a plain-text reading of a specific statutory provision. The plain-text argument seems stronger. My prediction has therefore flipped: I now believe the Court is more likely to affirm the judgment below, siding with the amicus.",
          "design_beliefs": "This observation was a breakthrough, validating one strategic hypothesis while simultaneously revealing a powerful new heuristic, all as a result of a \"failed\" action.\n\n**Core Principles (Reinforced):**\n*   **Model the Adversarial Process (Reinforced and Fulfilled):** This observation has allowed me to finally construct an accurate model of the conflict: Petitioner and Government versus a Court-appointed Amicus. The very fact that the Court appointed an amicus to defend the judgment signals that the amicus's argument is one the Court takes very seriously and wanted to hear, which is a crucial piece of meta-information.\n\n**Applied Principles & Heuristics (Critique and Refinement):**\n*   **\"Tool Limitation Assessment\" (Strongly Validated):** My hypothesis that the `closed_search` on `docket_files` tool cannot retrieve a docket *sheet* but only individual documents is now strongly supported. The query 'docket' functioned as a simple keyword search across document contents, not a structured query for a specific document type. This confirms the tool is for content retrieval, not structural database access.\n*   **\"Search the Docket Entries, Not Just the Files\" (Refined):** The strategy to find a \"map\" of the case was correct, but the tactic of searching for the docket sheet itself was flawed due to tool limitations. The key insight is that other documents can serve the same mapping function.\n*   **\"Failed Search as a Signal\" Heuristic (Spectacularly Vindicated):** The failure of my intended action (finding the docket sheet) was more productive than success would have been. It returned a set of ancillary documents that inadvertently contained the single most important piece of missing evidence: the amicus brief. This proves the heuristic's value in transforming dead ends into serendipitous discoveries and treating every observation, even a failure, as new information about the environment.\n\n**Emerging Heuristics / Next Steps (Promoted to Active Strategy):**\n*   **\"Service Documents as a Map\" (New Core Heuristic):** This is a major discovery. The \"Affidavit of Service\" and \"Certificate of Service\" documents (9, 18, 20, 21) are information-rich proxies for a formal docket. They identify the key parties, their counsel, the titles of the briefs being filed, and the dates of filing. In an environment where a formal docket is inaccessible, searching for terms like \"affidavit of service\" or \"certificate of service\" is a highly effective strategy to reconstruct the case's procedural posture and identify the most important substantive documents. This is a far more robust approach than guessing brief titles."

App. 1a-16a) is pub-\nlished at 92 F.4th 304. \nJURISDICTION \nThe Fifth Circuit entered judgment on February 2, \n2024. Petitioner filed a petition for a writ of certiorari on \nMarch 8, 2024, which the Court granted on July 2, 2024. \nThe Court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254(1). \nSTATUTORY PROVISION INVOLVED \nThe relevant provisions of the First Step Act of 2018, \nPub. L. No. 115-391, 132 Stat. 5194, are reproduced in the \npetition appendix at pages 17a-21a. \nINTRODUCTION \nSection 924(c) of title 18 of the U.S. Code authorizes \ndrastic mandatory minimum sentences for those who \ncommit certain federal crimes while carrying, brandish-\ning, or discharging a firearm. For first offenses, it calls for \na mandatory minimum sentence between five and ten \nyears\u2019 imprisonment. For second or subsequent offenses, \nthat number jumps to 25 years. The statute requires that \nthe sentence for each section 924(c) count run consecu-\ntively with any other sentence. \nIn Deal v. United States, 508 U.S. 129 (1993), the \nCourt held that section 924(c), as originally enacted, \nrequired imposition of the 25-year mandatory minimum if \na defendant was convicted of multiple section 924(c) \ncounts in a single criminal proceeding. Thus, even a first-\ntime offender, if charged with multiple section 924(c) \ncounts, could face multiple 25-year sentences, running \nconsecutively. This effect, which often resulted in de facto \nlife sentences for first-time offenders, came to be known \nas \u201cstacking.\u201d \nStacking was widely regarded as unjust and irration-\nal. As one district court noted, a first-time, nonviolent \noffender who carried a firearm during a string of simple \n\n2 \n \ndrug sales would face more prison time than a murderer. \nCongress finally answered the calls for corrective action \nwith the First Step Act of 2018 (FSA). A principal aim of \nthe law was to end stacking. To that end, section 403(a) \nof the FSA amended section 924(c) to abrogate Deal, so \nthat the statute now permits enhanced sentences only \n\u201c[i]n the case of a violation of this subsection that occurs \nafter a prior conviction under this subsection has become \nfinal.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c). As a result, now only true \nrecidivists may be sentenced to section 924(c)\u2019s enhan-\nced 25-year mandatory minimum. \nBut under 1 U.S.C. \u00a7 109, the default rule for such \nsentencing reforms is that they apply only to crimes com-\nmitted after enactment. Appreciating the grave injustice \nthat would result if stacking were allowed to continue in \npost-enactment sentencings for pre-enactment conduct, \nCongress overrode the default rule, making section \n403(a)\u2019s sentencing reform retroactive. It thus adopted \nsection 403(b), which specifies that section 403(a) \u201cshall \napply to any offense that was committed before the date \nof enactment of this Act, if a sentence for the offense has \nnot been imposed as of such date of enactment.\u201d  \nAll agree that this language makes section 403(a) \nrelief available to a defendant who committed an offense \npre-enactment but is sentenced post-enactment. All also \nagree that it does not make relief available to anyone who \ncommitted an offense pre-enactment and whose sentence \nand judgment of conviction were final on the date of \nenactment and remain so today. The only question here is \nwhether it makes section 403(a) relief available to a \ndefendant who was sentenced pre-enactment, but whose \ninitial sentence was thereafter vacated, rendering the \ninitial sentence void ab initio and necessitating post-\nenactment plenary resentencing. \nThe plain text of section 403(b) supplies the answer: \nIt does. As a starting point, \u201ca sentence for the offense\u201d \n\n3 \n \ndoes not\u2014cannot\u2014include a sentence that has been \nvacated. A vacated sentence is a nullity, one treated by \noperation of law as never having been imposed. The point \nof vacatur is to ensure that the object has no legal effect \nand works no ongoing prejudice. Congress is presumed to \nunderstand and incorporate background legal principles \nlike this and thus could not have intended \u201ca sentence\u201d to \ninclude a vacated sentence. \nThis is confirmed by the statutory context, including \nthe verb tense and preposition that Congress used. The \npresent-perfect tense, used together with the preposition \n\u201cas of,\u201d indicates that Congress sought to deny section \n403(a)\u2019s reforms only to those defendants whose judg-\nments of conviction were final on the date of enactment \nand remain so today. As the government now agrees, no \nordinary English speaker would say that a sentence \u201chas \nbeen imposed as of December 21, 2018\u201d if the sentence \nwas vacated and no longer has any force or effect.  \nReading section 403(b) as drawing a line between \npending and past cases reflects Congress\u2019s evident desire \nto respect the finality of judgments. But finality is not an \nissue when a judgment is vacated for reasons independent \nof the FSA; such a case is \u201cpending\u201d like any other. That \nis confirmed by post-vacatur practice, which calls for an \nentirely new, de novo proceeding at which Congress could \nnot have intended stacking to remain available.  \nNone of the contrary rationales supplied by the court \nbelow or by the Sixth and Eleventh Circuits is persuasive. \nThose courts\u2019 rationales would revise the statute\u2019s \nlanguage and blinder the Court to the statute\u2019s context, \nstructure, and manifest purpose, reading section 403(b) \nto defeat Congress\u2019s design rather than to conform to it. \nThis Court\u2019s cases require no such result. If there were \nany doubt about that, the rule of lenity would require \nresolving it in petitioner\u2019s favor and thus reversing the \ndecision below. \n\n4 \n \nSTATEMENT \nA. Legal background \n1. Section 924(c) of title 18 of the U.S. Code crim-\ninalizes the use, carrying, or possession of a firearm in \nconnection with a \u201ccrime of violence or drug trafficking \ncrime.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A).  \nConviction for a first section 924(c) violation carries \na mandatory minimum sentence of five years for offenders \nwho carry or possess a firearm during a crime of violence \nor a drug trafficking crime. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A)(i). \nAs originally enacted and through December 21, 2018, a \nconviction for a \u201csecond or subsequent\u201d 924(c) violation \ncarried a mandatory minimum sentence of 25 years. Id. \n\u00a7 924(c)(1)(C). Moreover, when a defendant is convicted \nof violating section 924(c), the statute\u2019s mandatory \nminimum sentence must run consecutively rather than \nconcurrently \u201cwith any other term of imprisonment.\u201d Id. \n\u00a7 924(c)(1)(D)(ii).  \nIn Deal v. United States, 508 U.S. 129 (1993), the \nCourt interpreted section 924(c)\u2019s \u201csecond or subse-\nquent\u201d language to apply to multiple 924(c) convictions \nobtained in a single criminal proceeding. See 508 U.S. at \n134 (rejecting the contention that that section \u201c924(c)(1) \nmust be read to impose the enhanced sentence only for an \noffense committed after a previous sentence has become \nfinal\u201d). In other words, according to the Court, a \ndefendant could commit an initial and \u201csubsequent\u201d \noffense as part of a single criminal transaction prosecuted \nin a single case. The Court thus rejected the notion that \nsection 924(c) was intended to punish only recidivists \nand held that a defendant with no prior criminal history \ncould receive enhanced, consecutive sentences for each \nsection 924(c) count charged. Ibid. \nGiven its lengthy minimum consecutive penalties, \nsection 924(c) threatened exceptionally \u201clong prison sen-\n\n5 \n \ntences for anyone who uses a firearm in connection with \ncertain other federal crimes.\u201d United States v. Davis, 588 \nU.S. 445, 448 (2019). The practice of \u201ccharging multiple \nviolations of section 924(c) within the same indictment\u201d \nbecame known as \u201cstacking.\u201d See U.S. Sentencing Com-\nmission, Mandatory Minimum Penalties for Firearm \nOffenses in the Federal Criminal Justice System 271 (Oct. \n2011) (hereinafter USSC Report). Because each count \nbeyond the first was subject to the enhanced 25-year \nminimum penalty, stacking often resulted in de facto life \nsentences for first-time section 924(c) offenders\u2014often \nseveral hundred years\u2019 imprisonment imposed all at once. \nAs one court noted, a first-time offender frequently would \nreceive a lighter sentence \u201cif he had committed murder\u201d \nrather than a series of nonviolent drug sales while carry-\ning a firearm. United States v. Holloway, 68 F. Supp. 3d \n310, 313 (E.D.N.Y. 2014). \nStacking was widely criticized as unjust. District \njudges\u2014those on the front lines of the federal criminal \njustice system\u2014objected to having to impose what they \nviewed as drastic and disproportionate sentences for first-\ntime (and often nonviolent) offenders. See, e.g., United \nStates v. Angelos, 345 F. Supp. 2d 1227, 1230-33 (D. Utah \n2004) (having to sentence the defendant, a \u201ctwenty-four-\nyear-old first offender who is a successful music execu-\ntive with two young children,\u201d to \u201cprison for the rest of \nhis life is unjust, cruel, and even irrational\u201d). \nCircuit judges likewise expressed great discomfort \nhaving to affirm \u201cirrational, inhumane, and absurd\u201d \nsentences that were \u201ca predictable by-product of the cruel \nand unjust mandatory minimum sentencing scheme \nadopted by Congress.\u201d United States v. Hungerford, 465 \nF.3d 1113, 1118 (9th Cir. 2006) (Reinhardt, J., con-\ncurring); see also, e.g., United States v. Hunter, 770 F.3d \n740, 746-747 (8th Cir. 2014) (Bright, J., concurring) \n(decrying the sentence imposed as \u201cout of this world\u201d and \n\n6 \n \n\u201cjoin[ing] in the litany of criticisms directed towards\u201d the \n\u201coverly harsh\u201d practice of sentence stacking). \nJudges and commentators observed that, beyond the \nundue harshness of mandatory minimum sentences, the \nlaw also produced wildly divergent sentencing outcomes \nbased on mere geography\u2014prosecutors in some jurisdic-\ntions used stacking as a matter of course, while others \nmore often avoided it. See In re Hernandez, 857 F.3d \n1162, 1169 (11th Cir. 2017) (Martin, J., concurring) \n(explaining that the defendant \u201cmight never have \nreceived this sentence if he had been sentenced in another \npart of the country\u201d). And prosecutors frequently used \nthe threat of stacked sentences to induce defendants to \naccept plea deals, thus forfeiting their Sixth Amendment \nright to a jury trial, adding constitutional insult to \nstatutory injury. See Human Rights Watch, An Offer You \nCan\u2019t Refuse: How US Federal Prosecutors Force Drug \nDefendants to Plead Guilty (2013). \nAmong those calling for reform was the Sentencing \nCommission itself. USSC Report 359-362. In a report to \nCongress, the Commission explained that \u201c[t]he \u2018stack-\ning\u2019 of mandatory minimum penalties for multiple viola-\ntions of section 924(c) results in excessively severe and \nunjust sentences in some cases.\u201d Id. at 359. In many of \nthose cases, \u201cthe offense did not involve any physical \nharm or threat of physical harm to a person.\u201d Ibid. The \nCommission noted that the Judicial Conference had, on \nmultiple occasions, urged Congress \u201cto amend the \n\u2018draconian\u2019 penalties established at section 924(c).\u201d Id. \nat 360-361 (quoting Mandatory Minimums and Unin-\ntended Consequences: Hearing on H.R. 2934, H.R. 834, \nand H.R. 1466 Before the Subcommittee on Crime, \nTerrorism, and Homeland Security of the House Commit-\ntee on the Judiciary, 111th Cong. 35 (2009)); see also \nHearing Before the Over-Criminalization Task Force of \n2014 of the House Committee on the Judiciary, 113th \n\n7 \n \nCong. 23 (2014) (testimony of Hon. Irene M. Keeley, \nJudicial Conference of the United States). \n2. Although it took several attempts over nearly a \ndecade, Congress finally heeded the Sentencing Commis-\nsion\u2019s call to action in 2018. Late that year, it enacted and \nPresident Trump signed the First Step Act, which was the \n\u201cproduct of a remarkable bipartisan effort.\u201d United States \nv. Henry, 983 F.3d 214, 218 (6th Cir. 2020). The \nculmination of work by an \u201cextraordinary political coali-\ntion\u201d (164 Cong. Rec. S7645 (daily ed. Dec. 17, 2018) \n(statement of Sen. Durbin)), the FSA made \u201conce-in-a-\ngeneration reforms to America\u2019s prison and sentencing \nsystem\u201d (Senate Passes Landmark Criminal Justice \nReform, U.S. Senate Committee on the Judiciary (Dec. \n18, 2018)). \nSection 403 of the FSA addresses sentence stacking. \nIts well-recognized purpose is \u201cto remedy past over-\nzealous use of mandatory-minimum sentences\u201d under \nsection 924(c). Henry, 983 F.3d at 218. To that end, \nsection 403(a) amends section 924(c) to clarify that the\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

App. 1a-16a) is pub-\nlished at 92 F.4th 304. \nJURISDICTION \nThe Fifth Circuit entered judgment on February 2, \n2024. Petitioner filed a petition for a writ of certiorari on \nMarch 8, 2024, which the Court granted on July 2, 2024. \nThe Court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254(1). \nSTATUTORY PROVISION INVOLVED \nThe relevant provisions of the First Step Act of 2018, \nPub. L. No. 115-391, 132 Stat. 5194, are reproduced in the \npetition appendix at pages 17a-21a. \nINTRODUCTION \nSection 924(c) of title 18 of the U.S. Code authorizes \ndrastic mandatory minimum sentences for those who \ncommit certain federal crimes while carrying, brandish-\ning, or discharging a firearm. For first offenses, it calls for \na mandatory minimum sentence between five and ten \nyears\u2019 imprisonment. For second or subsequent offenses, \nthat number jumps to 25 years. The statute requires that \nthe sentence for each section 924(c) count run consecu-\ntively with any other sentence. \nIn Deal v. United States, 508 U.S. 129 (1993), the \nCourt held that section 924(c), as originally enacted, \nrequired imposition of the 25-year mandatory minimum if \na defendant was convicted of multiple section 924(c) \ncounts in a single criminal proceeding. Thus, even a first-\ntime offender, if charged with multiple section 924(c) \ncounts, could face multiple 25-year sentences, running \nconsecutively. This effect, which often resulted in de facto \nlife sentences for first-time offenders, came to be known \nas \u201cstacking.\u201d \nStacking was widely regarded as unjust and irration-\nal. As one district court noted, a first-time, nonviolent \noffender who carried a firearm during a string of simple \n\n2 \n \ndrug sales would face more prison time than a murderer. \nCongress finally answered the calls for corrective action \nwith the First Step Act of 2018 (FSA). A principal aim of \nthe law was to end stacking. To that end, section 403(a) \nof the FSA amended section 924(c) to abrogate Deal, so \nthat the statute now permits enhanced sentences only \n\u201c[i]n the case of a violation of this subsection that occurs \nafter a prior conviction under this subsection has become \nfinal.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c). As a result, now only true \nrecidivists may be sentenced to section 924(c)\u2019s enhan-\nced 25-year mandatory minimum. \nBut under 1 U.S.C. \u00a7 109, the default rule for such \nsentencing reforms is that they apply only to crimes com-\nmitted after enactment. Appreciating the grave injustice \nthat would result if stacking were allowed to continue in \npost-enactment sentencings for pre-enactment conduct, \nCongress overrode the default rule, making section \n403(a)\u2019s sentencing reform retroactive. It thus adopted \nsection 403(b), which specifies that section 403(a) \u201cshall \napply to any offense that was committed before the date \nof enactment of this Act, if a sentence for the offense has \nnot been imposed as of such date of enactment.\u201d  \nAll agree that this language makes section 403(a) \nrelief available to a defendant who committed an offense \npre-enactment but is sentenced post-enactment. All also \nagree that it does not make relief available to anyone who \ncommitted an offense pre-enactment and whose sentence \nand judgment of conviction were final on the date of \nenactment and remain so today. The only question here is \nwhether it makes section 403(a) relief available to a \ndefendant who was sentenced pre-enactment, but whose \ninitial sentence was thereafter vacated, rendering the \ninitial sentence void ab initio and necessitating post-\nenactment plenary resentencing. \nThe plain text of section 403(b) supplies the answer: \nIt does. As a starting point, \u201ca sentence for the offense\u201d \n\n3 \n \ndoes not\u2014cannot\u2014include a sentence that has been \nvacated. A vacated sentence is a nullity, one treated by \noperation of law as never having been imposed. The point \nof vacatur is to ensure that the object has no legal effect \nand works no ongoing prejudice. Congress is presumed to \nunderstand and incorporate background legal principles \nlike this and thus could not have intended \u201ca sentence\u201d to \ninclude a vacated sentence. \nThis is confirmed by the statutory context, including \nthe verb tense and preposition that Congress used. The \npresent-perfect tense, used together with the preposition \n\u201cas of,\u201d indicates that Congress sought to deny section \n403(a)\u2019s reforms only to those defendants whose judg-\nments of conviction were final on the date of enactment \nand remain so today. As the government now agrees, no \nordinary English speaker would say that a sentence \u201chas \nbeen imposed as of December 21, 2018\u201d if the sentence \nwas vacated and no longer has any force or effect.  \nReading section 403(b) as drawing a line between \npending and past cases reflects Congress\u2019s evident desire \nto respect the finality of judgments. But finality is not an \nissue when a judgment is vacated for reasons independent \nof the FSA; such a case is \u201cpending\u201d like any other. That \nis confirmed by post-vacatur practice, which calls for an \nentirely new, de novo proceeding at which Congress could \nnot have intended stacking to remain available.  \nNone of the contrary rationales supplied by the court \nbelow or by the Sixth and Eleventh Circuits is persuasive. \nThose courts\u2019 rationales would revise the statute\u2019s \nlanguage and blinder the Court to the statute\u2019s context, \nstructure, and manifest purpose, reading section 403(b) \nto defeat Congress\u2019s design rather than to conform to it. \nThis Court\u2019s cases require no such result. If there were \nany doubt about that, the rule of lenity would require \nresolving it in petitioner\u2019s favor and thus reversing the \ndecision below. \n\n4 \n \nSTATEMENT \nA. Legal background \n1. Section 924(c) of title 18 of the U.S. Code crim-\ninalizes the use, carrying, or possession of a firearm in \nconnection with a \u201ccrime of violence or drug trafficking \ncrime.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A).  \nConviction for a first section 924(c) violation carries \na mandatory minimum sentence of five years for offenders \nwho carry or possess a firearm during a crime of violence \nor a drug trafficking crime. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A)(i). \nAs originally enacted and through December 21, 2018, a \nconviction for a \u201csecond or subsequent\u201d 924(c) violation \ncarried a mandatory minimum sentence of 25 years. Id. \n\u00a7 924(c)(1)(C). Moreover, when a defendant is convicted \nof violating section 924(c), the statute\u2019s mandatory \nminimum sentence must run consecutively rather than \nconcurrently \u201cwith any other term of imprisonment.\u201d Id. \n\u00a7 924(c)(1)(D)(ii).  \nIn Deal v. United States, 508 U.S. 129 (1993), the \nCourt interpreted section 924(c)\u2019s \u201csecond or subse-\nquent\u201d language to apply to multiple 924(c) convictions \nobtained in a single criminal proceeding. See 508 U.S. at \n134 (rejecting the contention that that section \u201c924(c)(1) \nmust be read to impose the enhanced sentence only for an \noffense committed after a previous sentence has become \nfinal\u201d). In other words, according to the Court, a \ndefendant could commit an initial and \u201csubsequent\u201d \noffense as part of a single criminal transaction prosecuted \nin a single case. The Court thus rejected the notion that \nsection 924(c) was intended to punish only recidivists \nand held that a defendant with no prior criminal history \ncould receive enhanced, consecutive sentences for each \nsection 924(c) count charged. Ibid. \nGiven its lengthy minimum consecutive penalties, \nsection 924(c) threatened exceptionally \u201clong prison sen-\n\n5 \n \ntences for anyone who uses a firearm in connection with \ncertain other federal crimes.\u201d United States v. Davis, 588 \nU.S. 445, 448 (2019). The practice of \u201ccharging multiple \nviolations of section 924(c) within the same indictment\u201d \nbecame known as \u201cstacking.\u201d See U.S. Sentencing Com-\nmission, Mandatory Minimum Penalties for Firearm \nOffenses in the Federal Criminal Justice System 271 (Oct. \n2011) (hereinafter USSC Report). Because each count \nbeyond the first was subject to the enhanced 25-year \nminimum penalty, stacking often resulted in de facto life \nsentences for first-time section 924(c) offenders\u2014often \nseveral hundred years\u2019 imprisonment imposed all at once. \nAs one court noted, a first-time offender frequently would \nreceive a lighter sentence \u201cif he had committed murder\u201d \nrather than a series of nonviolent drug sales while carry-\ning a firearm. United States v. Holloway, 68 F. Supp. 3d \n310, 313 (E.D.N.Y. 2014). \nStacking was widely criticized as unjust. District \njudges\u2014those on the front lines of the federal criminal \njustice system\u2014objected to having to impose what they \nviewed as drastic and disproportionate sentences for first-\ntime (and often nonviolent) offenders. See, e.g., United \nStates v. Angelos, 345 F. Supp. 2d 1227, 1230-33 (D. Utah \n2004) (having to sentence the defendant, a \u201ctwenty-four-\nyear-old first offender who is a successful music execu-\ntive with two young children,\u201d to \u201cprison for the rest of \nhis life is unjust, cruel, and even irrational\u201d). \nCircuit judges likewise expressed great discomfort \nhaving to affirm \u201cirrational, inhumane, and absurd\u201d \nsentences that were \u201ca predictable by-product of the cruel \nand unjust mandatory minimum sentencing scheme \nadopted by Congress.\u201d United States v. Hungerford, 465 \nF.3d 1113, 1118 (9th Cir. 2006) (Reinhardt, J., con-\ncurring); see also, e.g., United States v. Hunter, 770 F.3d \n740, 746-747 (8th Cir. 2014) (Bright, J., concurring) \n(decrying the sentence imposed as \u201cout of this world\u201d and \n\n6 \n \n\u201cjoin[ing] in the litany of criticisms directed towards\u201d the \n\u201coverly harsh\u201d practice of sentence stacking). \nJudges and commentators observed that, beyond the \nundue harshness of mandatory minimum sentences, the \nlaw also produced wildly divergent sentencing outcomes \nbased on mere geography\u2014prosecutors in some jurisdic-\ntions used stacking as a matter of course, while others \nmore often avoided it. See In re Hernandez, 857 F.3d \n1162, 1169 (11th Cir. 2017) (Martin, J., concurring) \n(explaining that the defendant \u201cmight never have \nreceived this sentence if he had been sentenced in another \npart of the country\u201d). And prosecutors frequently used \nthe threat of stacked sentences to induce defendants to \naccept plea deals, thus forfeiting their Sixth Amendment \nright to a jury trial, adding constitutional insult to \nstatutory injury. See Human Rights Watch, An Offer You \nCan\u2019t Refuse: How US Federal Prosecutors Force Drug \nDefendants to Plead Guilty (2013). \nAmong those calling for reform was the Sentencing \nCommission itself. USSC Report 359-362. In a report to \nCongress, the Commission explained that \u201c[t]he \u2018stack-\ning\u2019 of mandatory minimum penalties for multiple viola-\ntions of section 924(c) results in excessively severe and \nunjust sentences in some cases.\u201d Id. at 359. In many of \nthose cases, \u201cthe offense did not involve any physical \nharm or threat of physical harm to a person.\u201d Ibid. The \nCommission noted that the Judicial Conference had, on \nmultiple occasions, urged Congress \u201cto amend the \n\u2018draconian\u2019 penalties established at section 924(c).\u201d Id. \nat 360-361 (quoting Mandatory Minimums and Unin-\ntended Consequences: Hearing on H.R. 2934, H.R. 834, \nand H.R. 1466 Before the Subcommittee on Crime, \nTerrorism, and Homeland Security of the House Commit-\ntee on the Judiciary, 111th Cong. 35 (2009)); see also \nHearing Before the Over-Criminalization Task Force of \n2014 of the House Committee on the Judiciary, 113th \n\n7 \n \nCong. 23 (2014) (testimony of Hon. Irene M. Keeley, \nJudicial Conference of the United States). \n2. Although it took several attempts over nearly a \ndecade, Congress finally heeded the Sentencing Commis-\nsion\u2019s call to action in 2018. Late that year, it enacted and \nPresident Trump signed the First Step Act, which was the \n\u201cproduct of a remarkable bipartisan effort.\u201d United States \nv. Henry, 983 F.3d 214, 218 (6th Cir. 2020). The \nculmination of work by an \u201cextraordinary political coali-\ntion\u201d (164 Cong. Rec. S7645 (daily ed. Dec. 17, 2018) \n(statement of Sen. Durbin)), the FSA made \u201conce-in-a-\ngeneration reforms to America\u2019s prison and sentencing \nsystem\u201d (Senate Passes Landmark Criminal Justice \nReform, U.S. Senate Committee on the Judiciary (Dec. \n18, 2018)). \nSection 403 of the FSA addresses sentence stacking. \nIts well-recognized purpose is \u201cto remedy past over-\nzealous use of mandatory-minimum sentences\u201d under \nsection 924(c). Henry, 983 F.3d at 218. To that end, \nsection 403(a) amends section 924(c) to clarify that the \n25-year mandatory minimum sentence applies only for \nviolations \u201coccur[ing] after a prior\u201d section 924(c) \nconviction \u201chas become final,\u201d effectively overruling \nDeal. See Oversight Hearing on the Federal Bureau of \nPrisons and Implementation of the First Step Act: Hearing \nBefore the Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, and Home-\nland Security of the House Committee on the Judiciary, \n116th Cong. 2 (2019) (statement of Rep. Karen Bass) \n(describing section 403 as \u201celiminat[ing] the ability to \nstack firearm enhancements within the same indictment, \nwhich has historically resulted in excessive sentences\u201d).  \nWithout stacked 25-year sentences, first-time offen-\nders convicted of multiple violations of section 924(c) at \nonce will receive consecutive five-year minimum sen-\ntences, rather than one five-year sentence and one or more \n25-year sentences.  \n\n8 \n \n3. By default, a change in sentencing law is prospec-\ntive only. That is so by statute\u20141 U.S.C. \u00a7 109 specifies \nthat a \u201cnew criminal statute [that amends or repeals] an \nolder criminal statute shall not change the penalties \n\u2018incurred\u2019 under that older statute \u2018unless the repealing \nAct shall so expressly provide.\u2019\u201d Dorsey v. United States, \n567 U.S. 260, 272 (2012) (quoting 1 U.S.C. \u00a7 109). For \nthis purpose, \u201cpenalties are \u2018incurred\u2019 under the older \nstatute when an offender * * * commits the underlying \nconduct that makes the offender liable.\u201d Ibid. \nBut by late 2018, Congress knew well how wide-\nspread and problematic sentence stacking had become. \nLawmakers thus added section 403(b) to the FSA. It \nspecifies that section 403(a)\u2019s amendment of section \n924(c) shall apply not only to future offenders, but also to \npast offenders whose criminal cases remain pending: \nApplicability to Pending Cases.\u2014This sec-\ntion, and the amendments made by this section, \nshall apply to any offense that was committed \nbefore the date of enactment of this Act, if a \nsentence for the offense has not been imposed as \nof such date of enactment. \nCongress thus extended section 403(a) relief to all crim-\ninal defendants whose sentence \u201chas not been imposed as \nof\u201d December 21, 2018.1  \nIn contrast, Congress did not make section 403(a) a \nbasis for reducing the sentence of a defendant whose case \nwas and remains subject to a final criminal judgment. \nInstead, it provided limited alternative relief through \n \n1  Section 401, which reduces mandatory minimum sentences for \nvarious federal drug offenses, uses identical language. Because \nsections 403(b) and 401(c) use the same language, the lower courts \n\u201chave construed them to have the same meaning.\u201d United States v. \nBethea, 841 F. App\u2019x 544, 548 n.5 (4th Cir. 2021); accord United \nStates v. Mitchell, 38 F.4th 382, 389 (3d Cir. 2022). \n\n9 \n \nsection 404 to \u201cdefendants previously sentenced\u201d in a \nfinal judgment, which this Court addressed three Terms \nago in Concepcion v. United States, 597 U.S. 481 (2022). \nUnder certain circumstances, section 404 authorizes \nsentence-reduction motions, which are a more limited \nform of sentencing relief than plenary resentencing \nfollowing a vacatur. See Dillon v. United States, 560 U.S. \n817, 830 (2010).  \nB. Factual and procedural background \n1. Petitioner Tony Hewitt and his co-defendants \nwere convicted on various charges relating to a series of \nbank robberies in 2008. The district court originally \nsentenced Hewitt to 355 years of imprisonment, the bulk \nof which corresponded to a number of stacked section \n924(c) counts. United States v. Duffey, 456 F. App\u2019x 434, \n438-439 (5th Cir. 2012); Judgment, No. 3:08-cv-167, \nDkt. 374 (N.D. Tex. May 7, 2010). The Fifth Circuit \nreversed the convictions in part and vacated Hewitt\u2019s \nsentence due to an error not relevant here. Duffey, 456 F. \nApp\u2019x at 444. On remand, the district court resentenced \nHewitt to 305 years\u2014275 years of which corresponded to \nmandatory 25-year consecutive sentences for second or \nsubsequent 924(c) convictions. The Fifth Circuit af-\nfirmed. United States v. Ross, 582 F. App\u2019x 528, 530 (5th \nCir. 2014); Amended Judgment, No. 3:08-cv-167, Dkt. \n524 (N.D. Tex. Dec. 6, 2012).  \nIn 2019\u2014after the FSA\u2019s enactment\u2014this Court \nheld that section 924(c)\u2019s \u201cresidual clause\u201d is uncon-\nstitutionally vague. Davis, 588 U.S. at 448. Following \nDavis, conspiracy-based charges no longer support \nconvictions under section 924(c). Given that several of \nHewitt\u2019s convictions were predicated on conspiracy to \ncommit bank robbery, Hewitt moved the Fifth Circuit for \nauthorization to file a successive section 2255 habeas \npetition. Pet. App. 3a. The Fifth Circuit granted leave. \n\n10 \n \nIbid. The district court, in turn, vacated the conspiracy-\nbased section 924(c) convictions, vacated the sentence on \nthe \nremaining \nconvictions, \nand \nordered \nplenary \nresentencing. Ibid.  \n2. The case returned to the district court for de novo \nresentencing, but the new presentence report prepared in \nHewitt\u2019s case did not account for section 403(a)\u2019s inter-\nvening amendment of section 924(c). Pet. App. 3a-4a. \nHewitt thus objected to the report, arguing that section \n403(a) should apply. Ibid. The difference, he observed, \nwas substantial: Under the law in place at the time of his \noriginal sentencing, his minimum sentence for the re-\nmaining section 924(c) counts would be 105 years, still \neffectively a life sentence. Under section 403(a) of the \nFSA, the combined mandatory minimum is 25 years.  \nHewitt\u2019s co-defendants raised the same objections. \nAs to them, the government took the position that section \n403 was inapplicable on resentencing because the initial \nsentence for each had been imposed before the FSA\u2019s date \nof enactment. But by the time of Hewitt\u2019s resentencing, \nthe government had reversed its course and requested \napplication of section 403(a) at Hewitt\u2019s resentencing. \nSee Sentencing Tr., No. 3:08-cv-167, Dkt. 785 at 19:8-16 \n(N.D. Tex. Jan. 17, 2023). \nThe district court rejected Hewitt\u2019s and the \ngovernment\u2019s position. Id. at 22:18-23:5. The court \nreasoned that even when a sentence has been vacated, \n\u201cit\u2019s not vacated for purposes of the statute.\u201d Id. at \n22:25-23:1. It thus held that section 403(a) does not \napply and sentenced Hewitt to a 165-year term of im-\nprisonment, 105 of which corresponded to stacked \nsection 924(c) sentences. Pet. App. 5a; see Judgment on \nResentencing, No. 3:08-cv-167, Dkt. 780 (N.D. Tex. Nov. \n8, 2022).  \n\n11 \n \n3. The Fifth Circuit affirmed. See Pet. App. 1a-16a. \nBefore the court of appeals, Hewitt and the government \nagain both argued that section 403(a) should apply at \nresentencing following the judicial vacatur of a pre-FSA \nsentence. Pet. App. 7a. The Fifth Circuit nonetheless con-\ncluded that section 403(b) bars relief for Hewitt and his \ncodefendants. Pet. App. 6a. \nWhile the Fifth Circuit acknowledged that the phrase \n\u201chas not been imposed\u201d is an example of \u201cpresent-perfect \ntense,\u201d the court focused predominantly on the word \n\u201cimposed.\u201d Pet. App. 7a. It reasoned that whether a \nsentence has been imposed \u201cappears to hinge on a district \ncourt\u2019s action or inaction\u201d as a singular point in time, and \n\u201cnot on a defendant\u2019s status.\u201d Pet. App. 8a. It thus held \nthat section 403(b)\u2019s focus is on the one-time historical \nfact of a sentence\u2019s imposition. Ibid. Because Hewitt had \nbeen sentenced before the FSA\u2019s enactment as a matter of \nhistorical fact, it held relief under section 403(a) was \nunavailable. Ibid. \nThe court reasoned that \u201c[i]f Congress meant for the \nFirst Step Act\u2019s retroactivity bar to apply only to valid \nsentences, it could easily have said so.\u201d Pet. App. 8a. And \nit rejected Hewitt\u2019s arguments to the contrary, explaining \nthat \u201c[t]he mere observation that the statutory language \ncould be made clearer does not make it unclear in the first \nplace.\u201d Id. at 9a (quoting United States v. Jackson, 995 \nF.3d 522, 526 (6th Cir. 2021)). \nThe Fifth Circuit held further that \u201cvacatur has no \neffect\u201d on the outcome of the case. Pet. App. 9a. That \nconclusion was justified, the court explained, because \n\u201cotherwise, one who, as here, has been in prison for over \na decade serving later-vacated sentences would nonethe-\nless qualify\u201d for a more lenient sentence at resentencing \nunder the FSA. Pet. App. 9a-10a. The court referred to 18 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 3742(g), which requires use of the guidelines \n\u201cthat were in effect on the date of the previous sentencing \n\n12 \n \nof the defendant prior to the appeal\u201d for resentencing, \nwhich it characterized as giving continuing effect to \ninitial sentences that have been vacated. Id. at 10a. On \nthose grounds, the court affirmed. \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nPursuant to section 403(b) of the FSA, section 403(a) \napplies to a defendant who committed an offense and was \nconvicted and sentenced pre-enactment, but whose initial \nconviction and sentence have been vacated, necessitating \na post-enactment de novo resentencing.  \nA.1. The question here is whether Congress meant \u201ca \nsentence for the offense\u201d to include a sentence that was \npronounced before that date but later vacated. It could not \nhave done so. Congress drafts and enacts statutes against \nbackground legal principles, the content of which is \npresumptively incorporated into the meaning of the words \nit uses. As relevant here, the law treats a sentence that has \nbeen vacated as a nullity ab initio, as if it never existed. \nCases from before the Founding and consistently through \ntoday confirm that when an order or judgment is vacated, \nthe status quo ante is restored, and it is as though the order \nor judgment had never been made.  \nCongress is presumed to have known that settled \nlegal principle and, absent a contrary indication, to have \nincorporated it in the FSA. A sentence that has been \nvacated therefore cannot be \u201ca sentence for the offense,\u201d \nbecause a sentence that has been vacated does not exist. \nIt therefore cannot be ground to deny substantive relief at \nresentencing. \n2. Some lower courts have reasoned that to focus on \nthe invalidation ab initio of a vacated judgment is to add \nwords to section 403(b), effectively inserting the word \n\u201cvalid\u201d in front of the word \u201csentence.\u201d That reading has \nmatters backward. Again, the Court must presume that \nCongress incorporates settled legal principles into the \n\n13 \n \nstatutes it enacts. It therefore does not add words to the \nstatute to presume the word \u201csentence\u201d means a sentence \nthat has not been vacated. On the contrary, to read \u201ca \nsentence\u201d in section 403(b) to include a vacated sentence \nwould be to read it as \u201can initial sentence\u201d or \u201can original \nsentence.\u201d Such modifiers would be necessary to displace \nthe background rule that the law treats a sentence that \nhas been vacated as though it never existed. But Congress \ndid not include those words. \n3. Other courts have held that section 403(b) refers \nonly to the historical fact of a past pronouncement and \nthat a vacatur does not change the past. That is wrong \ntwice over. First, vacatur does change the past by opera-\ntion of law\u2014cases from time immemorial stand for the \nproposition that when an order is vacated, it as though the \nproceeding that produced the order never happened. That \nis why the Double Jeopardy Clause does not bar retrial \nafter a conviction is vacated on appeal. \nSecond, section 403(b) refers to the ongoing enforce-\nment of a sentence, not the fact of a past pronouncement. \nCongress\u2019s use of the present-perfect tense and the \npreposition \u201cas of\u201d confirm so. Use of the present-perfect \ntense implies concern with a time-span beginning in the \npast and extending up to now. And the preposition \u201cas of\u201d \nis used to indicate a time or date from which something \ncontinues. Together, they indicate that Congress was \nconcerned only with sentences that were pronounced pre-\nenactment and remain in force and effect today.  \nCommon English usage confirms the point. No one \nwould say that Hewitt\u2019s initial, since-vacated sentence \n\u201chas been imposed as of December 21, 2018,\u201d because it \nhas no continuing force or effect. If one wanted to refer to \nthe fact of a vacated sentence having been pronounced, \none would use the simple past tense and a preposition \nindicating a singular point in time: Hewitt\u2019s initial, since-\nvacated sentence was imposed before December 21, 2018. \n\n14 \n \nIndeed, Congress used just that formulation in section \n404, concerning sentencing modifications. That it did so \nthere but not in section 403(b) must be taken as inten-\ntional.  \n4. Statutory interpretation turns on ordinary, con-\ntemporary, and common use of the English language. \nThus, while rules of grammar and dictionary definitions \nare centrally important, the outcome cannot be \ndetermined by a single phrase scrutinized in the abstract. \nThe Court must look to the relevant language in its full \ncontext, with an eye to the statute\u2019s overall objective. \nOnly our interpretation is consistent with the FSA\u2019s \nbroader context, design, and purpose. Section 403(b) \nreflects a clear purpose: to make section 403(a)\u2019s amelior-\native sentencing reform available retroactively in pending \ncases while preserving the finality of valid criminal \njudgments. That line is sensible. Allowing application in \npending cases ensures that no court ever again engages in \nsentencing stacking, while at the same time respecting \nthe importance of the principle of finality to criminal \njustice and sound judicial administration. \nPlenary resentencings following full vacaturs are \n\u201cpending\u201d cases like any other; there is no sentence for \nthe defendant to serve, and a new one must be imposed by \nexercise of de novo judicial discretion. In that context, \napplication of section 403(a) would do nothing to disturb \nthe finality of an already-vacated judgment. Applying \nsection 403(a) to such cases is thus consistent with \nCongress\u2019s objective to foreclose stacking in pending \ncases while preserving the finality of past cases. \nThe opposite is true of the decision below. It draws an \narbitrary line between plenary sentencings and plenary \nresentencings, without any account for why Congress \nwould have intended such an irrational distinction. And \nin doing so, it ensures that prosecutors still may seek, and \n\n15 \n \ncourts still will be required to impose, stacked sentences \nin plenary sentencing proceedings into the future. That \ncannot be what Congress intended. \nB. The rule of lenity arises only if the Court concludes \nthat the statutory text is ambiguous, which the provision \nhere is not. But if the Court disagrees, it must resolve the \nambiguity in favor of Hewitt and the lesser sentence \nrequired under section 403(a). \nThe Court has repeatedly confirmed that the rule of \nlenity applies not only to statutes that define criminal \nliability, but also those that set the penalties for \nviolations. Under our interpretation of section 403(a), \nHewitt would face a mandatory minimum of 25 years. \nUnder the Fifth, Sixth, and Eleventh Circuit\u2019s mistaken \nconstruction, he would face a mandatory minimum of \nlonger than one century at his resentencing on the section \n924(c) counts alone. If there is any reasonable doubt \nabout the construction of section 403(a), it must be \nresolved in his favor. \nARGUMENT \n\u201cThe controlling principle in this case is the basic and \nunexceptional rule that courts must give effect to the \nclear meaning of statutes as written.\u201d Star Athletica, LLC \nv. Varsity Brands, Inc., 580 U.S. 405, 414 (2017) \n(quoting Estate of Coward v. Nicklos Drilling Co., 505 \nU.S. 469, 476 (1992)). When the statute\u2019s text is \u201cunam-\nbiguous,\u201d that \u201cfirst step of the interpretive inquiry\u201d is \nalso the \u201clast.\u201d Rotkiske v. Klemm, 589 U.S. 8, 13 (2019). \nTo interpret Congress\u2019s words, the Court must focus \non \u201cordinary, contemporary, [and] common\u201d use of the \nEnglish language. Star Athletica, 580 U.S. at 414. That \nmeans among other things the Court must give the text a \nreading that is consistent with and incorporates settled \nbackground legal principles, with which the public would \nexpect any words to comport. E.g., Cannon v. University \n\n16 \n \nof Chicago, 441 U.S. 677, 696-697 (1979) (explaining \nthat \u201c[i]t is always appropriate to assume that our elected \nrepresentatives, like other citizens, know the law\u201d). \nAnd while background principles, rules of grammar, \nand dictionary definitions are centrally important to the \ntask of statutory interpretation, the Court must \u201c\u2018con-\nsider not only the bare meaning\u2019 of the critical word or \nphrase \u2018but also its placement and purpose in the statu-\ntory scheme.\u2019\u201d Holloway v. United States, 526 U.S. 1, 6 \n(1999) (quoting Bailey v. United States, 516 U.S. 137, 145 \n(1995)). The only permissible meaning of a word or \nphrase is the one that fits with the statutory context and \npurpose, rather than conflicts with them. See, e.g., Dubin \nv. United States, 599 U.S. 110, 118-120 (2023). \nFirst, Congress did not intend the phrase \u201ca sentence \nfor the offense\u201d to include a vacated sentence. According \nto settled background principles, the law treats a vacated \nsentence as never having been pronounced. For a statute \nto override that principle requires a clear statement. \nThere is no such statement here.  \nSecond, the contrary rationales offered among the \nlower courts are unpersuasive. The rules of grammar, \nrelevant dictionary definitions, and statutory context all \nconfirm that Congress intended section 403(b) to \nauthorize section 403(a) relief in all pending cases, \nincluding cases that are pending de novo resentencing \nfollowing a vacatur. No other conclusion is consistent \nwith Congress\u2019s purpose or settled practice. And even if \nthere were doubt on that front (there should be none), it \nwould be resolved by the rule of lenity.  \nNo matter whether the Court finds the words clear or \nambiguous, a resentencing with the benefit of section \n403(a) is necessary. \n\n17 \n \nA. Section 403(a) applies to post-enactment \nde novo resentencings \nAll relevant considerations\u2014the text, context, and \npurpose of the FSA, the statute\u2019s design, and the back-\nground principles against which it was enacted\u2014confirm \nthat section 403(a) applies to plenary resentencings that \ntake place after the Act\u2019s enactment. \n1. A sentence that has been vacated is not \u201ca \nsentence for the offense\u201d \nThe central issue is whether Congress meant \u201ca \nsentence for the offense\u201d imposed \u201cas of\u201d December 21, \n2018, to include a sentence that was pronounced before \nthat date but later vacated. It did not. \na. One rule for reading \u201cstatutory text is recognizing \nthat Congress legislates against the backdrop of certain \nunexpressed presumptions.\u201d Bond v. United States, 572 \nU.S. 844, 857 (2014). Among those presumptions is that \n\u201cCongress is aware of existing law\u201d and, absent express \nindication otherwise, intends for the statutes it enacts to \ncomport with settled background legal principles and \nprecedents. See, e.g., Mississippi ex rel. Hood v. AU \nOptronics Corp., 571 U.S. 161, 169 (2014); accord \nCannon, 441 U.S. at 696-697. \nPut another way, the background principles against \nwhich Congress acts operate as default rules to which it \npresumptively intends for its enactments to conform. \nBecause the accepted legal backdrop will generally accord \nwith \u201cwidely held intuitions about how statutes ordin-\narily operate,\u201d a presumption that Congress means to \nincorporate background legal principles \u201cwill generally \ncoincide with legislative and public expectations.\u201d \nLandgraf v. USI Film Productions, 511 U.S. 244, 272 \n(1994). Cf. US Airways, Inc. v. McCutchen, 569 U.S. 88, \n102 (2013) (in a case concerning ERISA plan documents, \nrelying on the \u201cdefault rules [that] govern in the absence \n\n18 \n \nof a clear expression of [a] contrary intent\u201d); Staub v. \nProctor Hospital, 562 U.S. 411, 418 (2011) (in a federal \ntort case, observing that the Court must \u201cconsult general \nprinciples of law\u201d that \u201cform the background against \nwhich federal tort laws are enacted\u201d). \nb. Here, the settled legal background against which \nsection 403(b) was adopted demonstrates beyond debate \nthat Congress did not mean for \u201ca sentence\u201d to include a \nvacated sentence. Absent contrary intent, a vacated order \nis and always has been treated as though it was never \nentered in the first place\u2014it is a nullity, as though it never \nexisted. See United States v. Mitchell, 38 F.4th 382, 392 \n(3d Cir. 2022) (Bibas, J., concurring) (historical prin-\nciples \u201creveal that vacatur makes a sentence void from \nthe start\u201d). Nothing in section 403(b)\u2019s text overrides \nthat default understanding. \nTake first historical sources. At common law before \nthe Founding, vacatur on appeal made it \u201cas if no \n[judgment] had been\u201d entered, meaning in effect that \nthere was no \u201crecord of it.\u201d Ognell\u2019s Case (1592) 78 Eng. \nRep. 526, 526; 34 Cro. Eliz. 270, 271 (Q.B.); accord Eyre \nv. Woodfine (1592) 78 Eng. Rep. 533, 533; 34 Cro. Eliz. \n278, 278-279 (Q.B.). Countless other historical sources \nconfirm that when an order is vacated, it is \u201cin all respects \nas though the [order] had never been made.\u201d Norman v. \nNorman, 207 P. 970, 972 (Okla. 1922). Since time out of \nmind, courts have understood that vacatur \u201cputs the \nparties in the state, in which they were, immediately \nbefore the judgment was rendered,\u201d fully restoring the \nstatus quo ante. Lockwood v. Jones, 7 Conn. 431, 436 \n(1829). This Court summarized this principle more than \n150 years ago: \u201cvacating the former judgment * * * \nrender[s] it null and void, and the parties are left in the \nsame situation as if no trial had ever taken place in the \ncause.\u201d United States v. Ayres, 76 U.S. (9 Wall.) 608, 610 \n(1869).  \n\n19 \n \nA vacated order is not merely \u201csuspended\u201d on a \nforward-looking basis, while \u201cretain[ing] its vitality\u201d \nretrospectively. Stewart v. Oneal, 237 F. 897, 906 (6th \nCir. 1916). Rather, \u201cwhere an irregular order has been \nvacated it is held to be the same as though it never existed, \nand for that reason\u201d courts may not afford any \u201cprotec-\ntion to the acts which may have been performed under it.\u201d \nFarnsworth v. Western Union Telephone Co., 6 N.Y.S. \n735, 747 (Gen. Term 1889) (emphasis added). When \norders are vacated, it is \u201cas though they had never been \nmade or had\u201d in the first place. United States v. Mayse, 5 \nF.2d 885, 886 (9th Cir. 1925).2 \nThis ancient principle has been carried forward to \nmodern times without meaningful alteration. Like their \nforebears, cases since the midcentury onward confirm \nthat after a conviction is vacated, the defendant \u201cstand[s] \n \n2  Other historical examples expressing this principle are too many to \nlist. For a limited sample, see Williams v. Floyd, 27 N.C. 649, 656 \n(1845) (a void or \u201cstricken\u201d order is \u201cthe same as if the [order] had \nnever been made\u201d); Lawson v. Bissell, 7 Ohio St. 129, 132 (1857) \n(when a verdict and judgment are \u201cvacated\u201d it is \u201cas if there had been \nno trial\u201d); In re Lacey, 14 F. Cas. 906, 908 (C.C.D. Conn. 1874) \n(vacating an order allows the parties to act \u201cin the same way and \nmanner, and to the like effect\u201d as they could have had the order \n\u201cnever been made\u201d); Strickland v. Flagstaff Silver Mining Co., 1 Utah \n199, 204 (1875) (for purposes of post-judgment motions, a judgment \nthat is vacated \u201cwas as though it had never existed\u201d); Aultman v. \nSeiberling, 31 Ohio St. 201, 204 (1877) (when a decision is vacated, \nthe law and the facts are treated \u201cthe same as if no decision had been \nmade\u201d); Bondholders & Purchasers of the Iron Railroad v. Toledo, 62 \nF. 166, 168 (7th Cir. 1894) (after a court order vacating and annulling \na decree disallowing a claim, the claim was \u201cre-established in all \nrespects as fully as if [the vacated decree] had never been made\u201d); \nGreen v. McCarter, 42 S.E. 157, 158 (S.C. 1902) (when a judge \n\u201crevoke[s] his * * * order, the case [stands] just as if no order had been \nmade\u201d); In re Rochester Sanitarium & Baths Co., 222 F. 22, 26 (2d \nCir. 1915) (recognizing \u201c[t]he general rule\u201d that when a court vacates \nan order, \u201cit is the same as if such order had never existed\u201d). \n\n20 \n \nin the position of any man who was accused of a crime but \nhas not yet shown to have committed it.\u201d Fiswick v. \nUnited States, 329 U.S. 211, 223 (1946). \u201cThe general \nrule,\u201d according to these cases, \u201cis that when an order or \njudgment is vacated the previously existing status is \nrestored and the situation is the same as though the order \nor judgment had never been made.\u201d Wrang v. Spencer, \n235 A.2d 861, 863 (Conn. App. Ct. 1967). Nearly \nverbatim restatements of this universal principle appear \nin Mitchell v. Joseph, 117 F.2d 253, 255 (7th Cir. 1941); \nMiller v. Schlereth, 36 N.W.2d 497, 506 (Neb. 1949); \nTims v. Holland Furnace Co., 90 N.E.2d 376, 380 (Ohio \n1950); and Buchanan v. Cabiness, 245 S.W.2d 868, 873 \n(Mo. 1951) (en banc). \nThe notion that a vacated order is treated as though it \nhad never been entered in the first place reflects the same \nprinciple behind the Court\u2019s own Munsingwear doctrine: \nAn order vacating a judgment \u201celiminates [the] judg-\nment\u201d so that \u201cnone is prejudiced\u201d by it, \u201cclear[ing] the \npath for future relitigation of the issues between the \nparties.\u201d United States v. Munsingwear, 340 U.S. 36, 40 \n(1950). \u201cThe point of vacatur is to prevent\u201d its object \n\u201cfrom spawning any legal consequences, so that no party \nis harmed by\u201d it. Camreta v. Greene, 563 U.S. 692, 713 \n(2011) (citing Munsingwear). \nAnd the law not only treats the vacated judgment as \na nullity in its own right, but also regards the proceedings \nproducing it effectively as never having happened. Thus, \nfor example, the vacatur of a criminal judgment of convic-\ntion on appeal effectively erases from history the fact of \nthe jury\u2019s empanelment in the original trial, and thus in \nmost circumstances \u201cthere is no double jeopardy upon a \nnew trial.\u201d Burks v. United States, 437 U.S. 1, 12 (1978) \n(quoting Bryan v. United States, 338 U.S. 552, 560 \n(1950)). That rule \u201crests ultimately upon the premise that \nthe original conviction has, at the defendant\u2019s behest, \n\n21 \n \nbeen wholly nullified and the slate wiped clean.\u201d North \nCarolina v. Pearce, 395 U.S. 711, 721 (1969) (citing \nUnited States v. Ball, 163 U.S. 662 (1896)). \nThe same rationale applies with respect to senten-\ncing. As the Court made clear in Pepper v. United States, \n562 U.S. 476 (2011), when a court of appeals \u201cset[s] \naside [a defendant\u2019s] entire sentence and remand[s] for a \nde novo resentencing,\u201d all legal effect from the original \nsentencing proceeding is nullified, \u201ceffectively wip[ing] \nthe slate clean.\u201d Id. at 507. Rulings made at the original \nsentencing therefore have no continuing vitality under \nthe law-of-the-case doctrine. Ibid. \nc. The legal backdrop against which Congress en-\nacted the FSA is thus clear: When a criminal sentence is \nvacated, the status quo ante is restored as if the sentence \nhad never been pronounced. A sentence that has been \nvacated is a nullity; it is nothing; it never existed. See \nFiswick, 329 U.S. at 223.  \nThat resolves this case. Congress specified that \nsection 403(a)\u2019s sentencing reform shall apply \u201cif a \nsentence for the offense has not been imposed as of\u201d \nDecember 21, 2018. FSA \u00a7 403(b) (emphasis added). \nBecause a sentence that has been vacated is treated by \noperation of law as though it never was imposed\u2014so that \nit \u201cspawn[s no] legal consequences\u201d and \u201cno party is \nharmed by\u201d it (Camreta, 563 U.S. at 713 (quoting \nMunsingwear, 340 U.S. at 40-41))\u2014Congress could not \nhave intended for \u201ca sentence\u201d to include a vacated \nsentence. As a matter of law, an offender whose sentence \nhas been vacated is one for whom \u201ca sentence for the \noffense has not been imposed\u201d ever, including as of \nDecember 21, 2018.  \n\n22 \n \n2. Contrary opinions among the lower courts \nare not persuasive \na. In holding otherwise, the Fifth Circuit focused on \nthe indefinite article, \u201ca\u201d appearing before the word \n\u201csentence.\u201d See Pet. App. 8a-9a. The same argument was \nspelled out by then-Judge Barrett in her dissent in United \nStates v. Uriarte, 975 F.3d 596 (7th Cir. 2020) (en banc): \n\u201c[T]he indefinite article \u2018a\u2019 is broad enough,\u201d she argued, \n\u201cto refer to any sentence that has been imposed for the \noffense, even one that was subsequently vacated.\u201d Id. at \n608. In her and the Fifth Circuit\u2019s view, a pre-enactment \nsentence, even if later vacated, remains \u201ca sentence\u201d \nimposed \u201cas of\u201d December 21, 2018. Ibid.; Pet. App. 8a-\n9a; see also United States v. Hernandez, 107 F.4th 965, \n969 (11th Cir. 2024). \nRespectfully, that position disregards the nature of a \nvacatur and the default rule that it establishes. When \nCongress says \u201ca sentence\u201d without more, it cannot mean \na sentence that is treated by operation of law as never \nhaving been imposed. Otherwise, what would it mean for \nsomething to be treated as never having been imposed? \nThat conclusion does not add words to the statute, as \nthe Fifth Circuit implied. In the lower court\u2019s view, \u201c[i]f \nCongress meant for the First Step Act\u2019s retroactivity bar \nto apply only to valid sentences, it could easily have said \nso\u201d by specifying \u201ca valid sentence.\u201d Pet. App. 8a-9a. But \nthat misses the point, which is that an adjective like \n\u201cvalid\u201d would have been redundant given the background \nlegal principles against which Congress adopted the FSA. \nAgain, Congress is presumed to be aware of and \nincorporate those principles in the statues it enacts. And \nhere, the long-settled rule is that when an unlawful \u201corder \nhas been vacated it is held to be the same as though it \nnever existed\u201d and the law will \u201cafford no protection to \n\n23 \n \nthe acts which may have been performed under it.\u201d \nFarnsworth, 6 N.Y.S. at 747.  \nAccordingly, it is the Fifth Circuit\u2019s reading, not \npetitioner\u2019s, that would add words to the statute. To read \n\u201ca sentence\u201d as including a vacated sentence would be to \nread the statute as saying \u201can initial sentence\u201d or \u201can \noriginal sentence.\u201d Use of such adjectives would have \nreadily displaced the default rule that a vacated sentence \nis treated as a matter of law as never having existed. But \nCongress did not use those modifiers, and thus the \nassumption \u201cthat our elected representatives, like other \ncitizens, know the law\u201d when they draft and enact \nstatutes (Cannon, 441 U.S. at 696-697) carries the day \nfor Hewitt. \nb. Some lower courts have instead simply denied the \npremise of the argument, asserting that an order fully \nvacating a sentence \u201cdoes not require the district court to \nproceed as if the initial sentencing never happened.\u201d Pet. \nApp. 9a (quoting Uriarte, 975 F.3d at 608 (Barrett, J., \ndissenting)). For support, they have pointed to 18 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 3742(g)(1), which specifies that \u201ca district court \nimposing a sentence on remand\u201d following a vacatur on \nappeal \u201cmust apply the Sentencing Guidelines \u2018that were \nin effect on the date of the previous sentencing of the defen-\ndant prior to the appeal.\u2019\u201d Uriarte, 975 F.3d at 608 \n(Barrett, J., dissenting) (quoting section 3742(g)(1)). \nThat, we are told, is evidence that the effects of a vacated \nsentence are not wholly eliminated, and a court need not \n\u201cproceed as if the earlier sentencing never happened.\u201d \nUnited States v. Carpenter, 80 F.4th 790, 792 (6th Cir. \n2023) (Kethledge, J., concurring in the denial of rehear-\ning en banc). \nThat misunderstands what section 3742(g)(1) does. \nAs a starting point, the very relevance of the provision is \ndoubtful. It provides only that when a court of appeals \nremands a case for resentencing (plenary or otherwise), \n\n24 \n \nthe district court must utilize the sentencing guidelines \n\u201cthat were in effect on the date of the previous sen-\ntencing.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(g)(1). That shows only that \nCongress did not want changes to the guidelines to apply \nretroactively at resentencing. The statute\u2019s reference to \nthe state of the law on \u201cthe date of\u201d a prior proceeding \ndoes not suggest in any way that a vacated sentence itself \ncontinues to have legal force or effect.  \nMoreover, to the extent section 3742(g) has any rele-\nvance, it is only to confirm that Congress knows how to \nuse express language to override the default rule when it \nwishes to. Our point is not that a vacated sentence can \nnever have ongoing consequences\u2014it is only that, given \nthat Congress is assumed to understand that a vacated \nsentence is treated as if it were never entered, Congress \nwould have to use express language to accomplish that \nobjective. That is at most what section 3742(g) confirms: \nWhen Congress wants a vacated sentence to continue to \nhave some effect, it says so using a clear statement. Such \nlanguage is missing from section 403(b). \n3. Section 403(b) refers to the ongoing enforce-\nment of a sentence, not the fact of a past pro-\nnouncement \na. Other lower court opinions have rejected the rele-\nvance of vacatur by characterizing the imposition of a \nsentence as a historical fact that, if it occurred, cannot be \nerased from the documented past by a later vacatur of the \nsentence. According to this rationale, when Congress said \nthat section 403(a) shall apply to a pre-enactment offense \n\u201cif a sentence for the offense has not been imposed as of\u201d \nDecember 21, 2018 (FSA \u00a7 403(b)), it actually meant \u201cif \na sentence was not pronounced before\u201d that date.  \nThe Eleventh Circuit took this view in Hernandez. \nThere, it reasoned that section 403(b) \u201cis best read to \nrefer to a completed act\u201d because it conjugates the verb \n\n25 \n \n\u201cimposed,\u201d which \u201crefers to the historical fact of pro-\nnouncement\u201d taking place at \u201ca specific point in time.\u201d \nHernandez, 107 F.4th at 969-970; accord Pet. App. 7a-\n8a. Viewing the imposition of a sentence this way renders \neffect of vacatur irrelevant, according to these sources, \nbecause \u201cvacatur does not erase * * * from history\u201d the \nrecorded fact that a sentence was pronounced on a date \npreceding enactment. United States v. Jackson, 995 F.3d \n522, 525 (6th Cir. 2021). \nb. The problem with that approach is two-fold.  \nFirst, that is indeed precisely what an order of vacatur \ndoes\u2014by operation of law, it erases from history both the \nvacated order or judgment and the proceeding that \nproduced it. Thus, when a verdict and judgment are \n\u201cvacate[d],\u201d it is \u201cas if no trial had ever taken place in the \ncause.\u201d Ayres, 76 U.S. (9 Wall.) at 610; accord Lawson, \n7 Ohio St. at 132 (following a vacatur, the case must \nproceed \u201cas if there had been no trial\u201d).  \nAgain, that is the premise underlying the rule that \n\u201cthere is no double jeopardy upon a new trial\u201d following \na vacatur on appeal of the final judgment. Burks, 437 U.S. \nat 12. \u201cThere are few if any rules of criminal procedure \nclearer than the rule that \u2018jeopardy attaches when the jury \nis empaneled and sworn.\u2019\u201d Martinez v. Illinois, 572 U.S. \n833, 839 (2014) (quoting Crist v. Bretz, 437 U.S. 28, 35 \n(1978)). But when a conviction is later vacated, the law \ntreats the jury\u2019s empanelment at the first trial effectively \nas if it had never happened. Burks, 437 U.S. at 12.  \nApplied here, that means that no legal disability may \nfollow from Hewitt\u2019s sentence ever having existed, \nincluding any disability following from the historical fact \nof the pronouncement having taken place. \nSecond, the historical-fact approach to section 403(b) \nis inconsistent with the verb tense and preposition that \nCongress used there. If Congress had meant the applic-\n\n26 \n \nability of section 403(a) to turn on whether a district \njudge had pronounced a sentence on a date preceding \nDecember 21, 2018, as a simple matter of historical fact, \nit would not have used the present-perfect tense or the \npreposition \u201cas of.\u201d Instead, it would have used the \nsimple past tense, together with a preposition such as \nbefore or prior to\u2014it would have said section 403(a) shall \napply to a pre-enactment offense \u201cif a sentence for the \noffense was imposed before such date of enactment.\u201d That \nword choice would have been consistent with the House \nLegislative Drafting Manual, which directs drafters of \nlegislation to use the past tense to refer to \u201cfacts that \nmust precede\u201d the statute\u2019s \u201coperation.\u201d House Legisla-\ntive Counsel\u2019s Manual on Drafting Style, HLC No. 104-1, \n\u00a7 351(f)(2), at 60 (1995). \nBut that is not the formulation that Congress chose. \nInstead, it used the present-perfect tense, together with \nthe preposition \u201cas of.\u201d Each alone\u2014and undeniably both \ntogether\u2014connote an ongoing condition rather than the \noccurrence of a singular past event.  \nThe relevant grammar rules make this clear. The \npresent-perfect tense uses the words \u201chas been\u201d (or in \nthis case \u201chas not been\u201d). Whereas the past tense \u201cis a \nsimple tense, just past,\u201d the present perfect \u201cis a com-\npound tense combining past and present.\u201d Rodney Hud-\ndleston & Geoffrey K. Pullum, The Cambridge Grammar \nof the English Language 142 (2002) (hereinafter \nCambridge Grammar). That is to say, the present perfect \n\u201cinvolves reference to both past and present time\u201d and \n\u201cis concerned with a time-span beginning in the past and \nextending up to now.\u201d Id. at 143 (emphasis added). Thus, \nin contrast with the past tense, which focuses on a \nsingular past occurrence, \u201cthe primary focus\u201d of the \npresent-perfect \u201cis on the present.\u201d Ibid. It accordingly \n\u201cis not used in contexts where the \u2018now\u2019 component of \n[the time span] is explicitly or implicitly excluded,\u201d such \n\n27 \n \nas when one is speaking about a discrete past event that \nhas concluded. Ibid. \nThat alone forecloses Hernandez\u2019s past-historical-\nfact rationale. If one says that a sentence \u201chas been im-\nposed as of\u201d some past date, it indicates that the sentence \nwas in effect on that date and is still being enforced today, \n\u201cextending up to now.\u201d Cambridge Grammar 143. It \nindicates, in other words, that the sentence remains final \nand in force at the time of speaking, and that it has not \nbeen vacated by a court. 3 \nThat conclusion follows not only from the use of the \npresent-perfect tense, but also from the preposition \u201cas \nof,\u201d which indicates a time or date \u201cfrom\u201d which some-\nthing begins or continues. See Collins English Dictionary \n113 (14th ed. 2023) (hereinafter Collins). One would say, \nfor example, that a contract is effective \u201cas of\u201d the date it \ncomes into force. In doing so, one would indicate the \ncommencement of a continuous period of enforcement\u2014\nthe effective date and onward. And if one were to combine \n\u201cas of\u201d with the present-perfect tense (stating that a \ncontract \u201chas been effective as of December 21, 2018\u201d), \nthe plain meaning would be that the contract was en-\nforceable on that date and remains so now. In contrast, it \nwould be incoherent to say that a contract \u201chas been \neffective as of December 21, 2018,\u201d if, at the time of \nspeaking, the contract was terminated by the parties or \nvoided by a court.3 \n \n3  It bears noting \u201cthe widely accepted modern legislative drafting \nconvention that a law should not be read to speak as of the date of \nenactment,\u201d but \u201c\u2018as of any date on which it is read.\u2019\u201d Carr v. United \nStates, 560 U.S. 438, 463 (2010) (Alito, J., dissenting) (quoting \nSenate Office of the Legislative Counsel, Legislative Drafting \nManual \u00a7 103(a), at 4 (1997)). This convention recognizes that most \nlaws \u201chave a continuing effect in that they apply over time,\u201d and they \nthus \u201cspeak at the time of reading, not merely at the time of their \nadoption.\u201d Id. at 464.  \n\n28 \n \nThe same goes for section 403(b). Congress specified \nthat section 403(a) shall apply to a pre-enactment offense \n\u201cif a sentence for the offense has not been imposed as of\u201d \nDecember 21, 2018. The inverse is that section 403(a) \nshall not apply to a pre-enactment offense \u201cif a sentence \nfor the offense has been imposed as of\u201d that date. But it \nwould be ungrammatical to say that Hewitt is a defendant \non whom \u201ca sentence has been imposed as of\u201d December \n21, 2018, because that formulation mistakenly implies \nthat at the time of speaking, there is a present, ongoing \nenforcement of his sentence. \nOne might say that Hewitt\u2019s initial sentence was \nimposed before that date. But, again, those are not the \nwords Congress used. And \u201ccourts must presume that a \nlegislature says in a statute what it means and means in a \nstatute what it says there.\u201d Connecticut National Bank v. \nGermain, 503 U.S. 249, 253-254 (1992). \nc. Use of the word \u201cimposed\u201d does not change mat-\nters. To be sure, \u201cimposed,\u201d viewed in isolation, can be \ntaken to mean \u201cto establish as something to be obeyed or \ncomplied with.\u201d Collins 984; see also Webster\u2019s Third \nNew International Dictionary 1136 (2002) (hereinafter \nWebster\u2019s) (defining impose as, among other things, \n\u201cbestow\u201d). On that meaning, a judge who imposes a \nsentence establishes it or bestows it on the defendant as a \nmatter of fact at a singular point in time.  \nBut the word can also mean to \u201cenforce\u201d (Collins \n984) or to \u201capply,\u201d as in a \u201cpenalty\u201d (Webster\u2019s 1136). \nUnderstood in that way, the word means an ongoing \ncondition of enforcement: A sentence is imposed on (it is \napplied to or enforced against) an offender during the \nentire duration of his or her incarceration. This meaning \nsuggests not a singular past occurrence that took place at \na particular point in time, but rather an ongoing condition: \nA \u201csentence remains \u2018imposed\u2019\u201d until it is \u201cvacate[d].\u201d \n\n29 \n \nUnited States v. Henry, 983 F.3d 214, 223 (6th Cir. \n2020). \nThe academic possibility of these two meanings does \nnot render section 403(b) ambiguous. The proper interp-\nretation of \u201cwords that can have more than one meaning\u201d \nare generally resolved \u201cby their surroundings.\u201d Arizona \nv. Inter Tribal Council of Arizona, 570 U.S. 1, 10 (2013) \n(quoting Whitman v. American Trucking Associations, \n531 U.S. 457, 466 (2001)). That is, the \u201csusceptibility\u201d \nof a singular word to multiple meanings does not neces-\nsarily render the word ambiguous, because \u201call but one of \nthe meanings is ordinarily eliminated by context.\u201d Deal v. \nUnited States, 508 U.S. 129, 131-132 (1993). \nJust so here. By using the present-perfect tense \n(rather than the past tense) and the preposition \u201cas of\u201d \n(rather than \u201cbefore\u201d or \u201cprior to\u201d) Congress signaled its \nfocus on a \u201ctime-span beginning in the past and extending \nup to now.\u201d Cambridge Grammar 143. Any contention \nthat the word \u201cimposed\u201d in section 403(b) \u201crefers to the \nhistorical fact of pronouncement\u201d at \u201ca specific point in \ntime\u201d (Hernandez, 107 F.4th at 970) rather than a \ncondition of ongoing enforcement would require reform-\ning the tense and replacing the preposition that Congress \nused. The law permits no such revisions. \nd. Moreover, section 404 of the FSA demonstrates \nthat Congress was aware of and intended the difference. \nThere, Congress provided for motions to reduce valid, \nfinal sentences in limited circumstances. See generally \nConcepcion v. United States, 597 U.S. 481 (2022). In \ndoing so, Congress limited relief in two notable ways. \nFirst, it specified in section 404(c) that \u201c[n]o court shall \nentertain a motion made under this section to reduce a \nsentence if the sentence was previously imposed or \npreviously reduced\u201d under certain circumstances. FSA \n\u00a7 404(c), Pet. App. 21a. If the lower court were correct \nthat Congress intended in section 403(b) to refer to a \n\n30 \n \nsingular past event (the pronouncement of a sentence \nbefore enactment), it presumably would have used the \nsame formulation\u2014section 403(a) shall apply to pre-\nenactment offenses \u201cif no sentence for the offense was \npreviously imposed.\u201d It did not do so. \n Second, also in section 404(c), Congress foreclosed \nrelief if a motion \u201cto reduce the sentence was, after the \ndate of enactment of this Act, denied after a complete \nreview of the motion on the merits.\u201d Again, if the lower \ncourt\u2019s reading were correct, Congress could have used \nthat alternative formulation in section 403(b)\u2014section \n403(a) shall apply to pre-enactment offenses \u201cif no \nsentence for the offense was imposed before said date of \nenactment.\u201d Again, it did not do so. \nBoth examples demonstrate that Congress knows \nhow to use the simple past tense to denote discrete events \ntaking place at fixed times in the past when it wishes to. \nIt did so in section 404(c), but it did not do so in section \n403(b). And the Court \u201cgenerally presum[es] that Con-\ngress acts intentionally and purposely when it includes \nparticular language in one section of a statute but omits it \nin another.\u201d Intel Corp. Investment Policy Committee v. \nSulyma, 589 U.S. 178, 186 (2020) (quoting BFP v. Res-\nolution Trust Corporation, 511 U.S. 531, 537 (1994)).  \nAll of this leads to a straightforward conclusion: \nWhen Congress said that section 403(a) shall apply to a \npre-enactment offense \u201cif a sentence for the offense has \nnot been imposed as of\u201d December 21, 2018 (FSA \n\u00a7 403(b), Pet. App. 20a), it meant a sentence that was \nbeing enforced \u201cas of\u201d that date and is still being enforced \nat the relevant time of reading. And needless to say, that \ndoes not describe a sentence vacated before the reading.  \n\n31 \n \n4. Purpose and practice confirm that section \n403(a) applies to plenary resentencings \na. Purpose and practice confirm the Fifth Circuit\u2019s \nerror in this case. Statutory interpretation turns on the \nway that ordinary English speakers use language. The \nCourt thus has a long history of reading statutory words \nand phrases \u201cnot in a vacuum, but with reference to the \nstatutory context, \u2018structure, history, and purpose,\u2019\u201d \n\u201cnot to mention common sense.\u201d Abramski v. United \nStates, 573 U.S. 169, 179 (2014) (quoting Maracich v. \nSpears, 570 U.S. 48, 76 (2013)). While rules of grammar, \ndictionary definitions, and background legal principles \nare of course matters of central importance, the Court \n\u201cmust not be guided by a single sentence or member of a \nsentence\u201d studied in the academic abstract; it must \ninstead \u201clook to the provisions of the whole law, and to \nits object and policy.\u201d Kelly v. Robinson, 479 U.S. 36, 43 \n(1986) (quoting Offshore Logistics, Inc. v. Tallentire, 477 \nU.S. 207, 221 (1986)).  \nAlthough broader in total effect, the FSA\u2019s \u201cmost \nimportant reforms\u201d were the \u201cchanges to mandatory \nminimums\u201d at issue here. 164 Cong. Rec. S7748 (daily \ned. Dec. 18, 2018) (statement of Sen. Klobuchar). Moved \nby heartless examples of excessive imprisonment, Con-\ngress set out to \u201celiminate[] the so-called stacking pro-\nvision in the U.S. Code\u201d and to \u201censure that sentencing \nenhancements for repeat offenses apply only to true \nrepeat offenders.\u201d Id. at S7774 (statement of Sen. \nCardin); accord 164 Cong. Rec. H10362 (daily ed. Dec. \n20, 2018) (statement of Rep. Nadler). Courts on both \nsides of the issue have thus concluded that the FSA\u2019s \npurpose \u201cis obvious: to reduce the harsh length of sen-\ntences for * * * certain firearms offenses.\u201d Mitchell, 38 \nF.4th at 387. It was, in other words, \u201cto ensure that the \nlengthy mandatory-minimum sentences for stacked \n\n32 \n \n\u00a7 924(c) convictions ended, whether at initial senten-\ncings or resentencings.\u201d Henry, 983 F.3d at 224.  \nTo that end, Congress made section 403(a) applicable \nnot only to post-enactment crimes, but also pre-enact-\nment ones. In doing so, it had two options: First, it could \nmake section 403(a) retroactively applicable to all \ndefendants serving stacked sentences, including those \nsubject to valid final judgments. Second, it could make \nsection 403(a) retroactively applicable to crimes com-\nmitted pre-enactment, but only in pending, non-final \ncases.  \nThe choice required a balance of competing values of \nthe highest order. On the one hand, Congress was deeply \nconcerned that defendants were serving unduly harsh and \noverlong sentences. Few government interventions have \nthe same impact and gravity as deprivation of liberty by \nimprisonment. On the other hand, there is a \u201cstrong \ninterest in preserving the finality of judgments.\u201d Harris \nv. Rivera, 454 U.S. 339, 348 n.21 (1981) (quoting Hen-\nderson v. Kibbe, 431 U.S. 145, 154 n.13 (1977)). \nLegislators understand that \u201c[f]inality is essential to both \nthe retributive and the deterrent functions of criminal \nlaw.\u201d Calderon v. Thompson, 523 U.S. 538, 555 (1998). \nAnd finality serves the public\u2019s interest in efficient \njudicial administration, increases confidence in the \njustice system, and fosters the public interest in repose. \nEvidently with these latter principles in mind, Con-\ngress selected the second option: It made section 403(a) \nrelief available to defendants whose criminal conduct \npredated enactment of the statute, but whose cases were \n\u201cpending\u201d (that is, those whose sentence \u201chas not been \n\n33 \n \nimposed as of\u201d the FSA\u2019s enactment). See FSA \u00a7 403(b) \n(titled \u201cApplicability to Pending Cases\u201d).4 \nIn taking this approach, \u201cCongress stanched, to the \ndegree that it could,\u201d the problem of sentence stacking, \nbut \u201cwithout overturning valid and settled sentences.\u201d \nUriarte, 975 F.3d at 601. \u201cIn choosing not to write \n\u00a7 403(b) to allow reductions to valid sentences that al-\nready had been imposed, Congress expressed a policy \npreference in favor of settled expectations and ease of \nadministration.\u201d Id. at 605; see also United States v. \nMerrell, 37 F.4th 571, 576 (9th Cir. 2022) (\u201c[W]e find it \nclear that \u00a7 403(b) was intended to ensure that the \nadoption of the First Step Act by itself would not affect \nany sentence previously imposed.\u201d); Henry, 983 F.3d at \n225 (\u201cCongress chose not to disrupt the finality of past \nsentences \n* * * \nfor \ndefendants \nserving \nstacked \nsentences.\u201d).  \nWhat is more, Congress \u201cnaturally wanted to reach \nall cases where there was not already a sentence in place.\u201d \nUriarte, 975 F.3d at 605. It intended to give defendants \nthe benefit of section 403(a) at all future plenary \nsentencing proceedings, without disturbing the sentences \nvalidly imposed in past proceedings. \nb. Applying section 403(a) to defendants like Hewitt \nis consistent with Congress\u2019s policy choice. The lower \ncourt\u2019s contrary decision is not. \nOnce a court vacates a criminal sentence and orders a \nde novo resentencing, there can no longer be any interest \n \n4  \u201cThis Court has long considered that the title of a statute and the \nheading of a section are tools available for the resolution of a doubt \nabout the meaning of\u201d a statutory provision. Dubin, 599 U.S. at 120-\n121 (cleaned up). A section title cannot \u201coverride\u201d the words that \nfollow, but Congress\u2019s words \u201cmust be construed in light of the terms \nsurrounding them, and the title Congress chose is among those \nterms.\u201d Id. at 121 (cleaned up).  \n\n34 \n \nin finality. See Pepper, 562 U.S. at 507. Because the \ndistrict court must resentence the defendant \u201cas if no \ninitial sentencing ever occurred\u201d (United States v. Burke, \n863 F.3d 1355, 1359 (11th Cir. 2017)), finality is already \nout the window by the time the district court undertakes \na de novo resentencing following a vacatur. The initial \nsentence is gone, and a brand new sentence must be deter-\nmined and pronounced. \nPractice bears this out. A plenary resentencing is a de \nnovo proceeding, and the district court must exercise its \ndiscretion anew in setting an appropriate sentence. \u201c[A]t \nany subsequent resentencing after a sentence has been set \naside,\u201d the court must determine a sentence \u201cbased on \nappropriate consideration of all of the factors listed in \n\u00a7 3553(a),\u201d without regard for prior rulings from the \ninitial sentencing. Pepper, 562 U.S. at 490. Among other \nthings, the probation officer must prepare a new \npresentence report (see Pet. App. 3a-4a; Dkt. 785, at 15), \nthe parties must submit new objections and responses \n(Dkts. 694, 699), and the court must hold a new hearing \nand consider and resolve the disagreements. See Concep-\ncion, 597 U.S. at 484.  \nThere is no conceivable reason that Congress would \nhave wanted district courts to continue imposing \u201cirra-\ntional, inhumane, and absurd\u201d sentences pursuant to a \n\u201ccruel and unjust\u201d sentencing rule (Hungerford, 465 \nF.3d at 1118 (Reinhardt, J., concurring)) that it had just \nrepealed retroactively for all pending cases. On the \ncontrary, lawmakers \u201cwanted the unfair practice\u201d of \nstacking \u201cstopped upon enactment\u201d (Uriarte, 975 F.3d at \n603) because they \u201crecognized that such lengthy sen-\ntences * * * were draconian and sought to end the \npractice\u201d (Henry, 983 F.3d at 225).  \nNo court and no party in any case presenting this \nissue has identified any reason why Congress would have \nintended for courts to continue to impose since-repu-\n\n35 \n \ndiated stacking rules in plenary resentencings. Simply \nput, there is none. Given \u201cthat Congress had determined \nthat the earlier sentencing structure resulted in sentences \nthat were too long and unfair,\u201d its goal was to \u201censur[e] \nthat those sentences would not be imposed on defendants \nyet to be sentenced,\u201d for whatever reason. Uriarte, 975 \nF.3d at 603. The Court is not required to turn a blind eye \nto that purpose, adopting an interpretation that does \nviolence to it rather than respecting it. \nB. Any ambiguity must be resolved in favor of \napplying section 403(a) to Hewitt \nIf, after all, there were any doubt about section \n403(b)\u2019s proper interpretation, the rule of lenity would \nrequire the Court to resolve it in Hewitt\u2019s favor. A penal \nstatute cannot be construed to impose a 105-year \nmandatory minimum sentence when another plausible \nreading would produce a 25-year mandatory minimum. \nNo matter the Court\u2019s view of the interpretations adopted \nby the Fifth, Sixth, and Eleventh Circuits, Hewitt\u2019s inter-\npretation is at the very least a plausible one. The rule of \nlenity thus requires the Court to adopt it.  \n1. The rule of lenity is an interpretive canon \u201cnot \nmuch less old than [statutory] construction itself.\u201d \nUnited States v. Wiltberger, 18 U.S. (5 Wheat.) 76, 95 \n(1820) (Marshall, C.J.). It demands that \u201cambiguity \nconcerning the ambit of criminal statutes should be \nresolved in favor of lenity.\u201d Skilling v. United States, 561 \nU.S. 358, 410 (2010) (quoting Cleveland v. United States, \n531 U.S. 12, 25 (2000)). It \u201capplies not only to \ninterpretations of the substantive ambit of criminal \nprohibitions, but also to the penalties they impose.\u201d \nBifulco v. United States, 447 U.S. 381, 387 (1980). \nSimply stated, \u201c[i]n the construction of a penal statute, it \nis well settled *\u202f*\u202f* that all reasonable doubts concerning \n\n36 \n \nits meaning ought to operate in favor of [the defendant].\u201d \nHarrison v. Vose, 50 U.S. (9 How.) 372, 378 (1850).  \nThe rule is grounded in the Constitution. It ensures \n\u201cthat the power of punishment is vested in the legislative, \nnot in the judicial department,\u201d for it is \u201cthe legislature, \nnot the Court, which is to define a crime, and ordain its \npunishment.\u201d Wiltberger, 18 U.S. (5 Wheat.) at 95; see \nalso Wooden v. United States, 595 U.S. 360, 388-392 \n(2022) (Gorsuch, J., concurring) (describing the due-\nprocess and separation-of-powers underpinnings).  \nThe rule of lenity applies when the ordinary tools of \nconstruction (\u201ctext, structure, and history\u201d) \u201cfail to \nestablish that\u201d the harsher reading is \u201cunambiguously \ncorrect.\u201d United States v. Granderson, 511 U.S. 39, 54 \n(1994). Lenity applies \u201cwhen, after consulting traditional \ncanons of statutory construction, [the Court is] left with \nan ambiguous statute.\u201d Shular v. United States, 589 U.S. \n154, 165 (2020) (quoting United States v. Shabani, 513 \nU.S. 10, 17 (1994)); see also Wooden, 595 U.S. at 392-\n393 (Gorsuch, J., concurring).  \n2. As we demonstrated in the preceding parts of this \nbrief, section 403(b) states plainly that Hewitt\u2019s plenary \nresentencing shall be subject to section 403(a). That is \nthe only reading consistent with the background rules \nagainst which Congress enacted the FSA, as well as the \nrelevant rules of grammar, the definitions of the terms \nused, the structure and scheme of the statute, and \nCongress\u2019s manifest purpose. \nIf for any reason the Court concludes that the lower \ncourt\u2019s alternative interpretation is a possible one, the \nrule of lenity would dictate that the ambiguity be resolved \nin Hewitt\u2019s favor. Indeed, this is a textbook case for \napplication of lenity. Defendants like Hewitt who are \nresentenced will receive drastically lower sentences \nunder our interpretation than they would under the Fifth, \n\n37 \n \nSixth, and Eleventh Circuits\u2019 construction. \u201c[L]enity \nmeans that the Court will not interpret a federal criminal \nstatute so as to increase the penalty that it places on an \nindividual when such an interpretation can be based on no \nmore than a guess as to what Congress intended.\u201d Bifulco, \n447 U.S. at 387 (quoting Ladner v. United States, 358 \nU.S. 169, 178 (1958)). To adopt the Fifth, Sixth, and \nEleventh Circuit\u2019s reading would mean making just such \na guess.  \nIf, after applying all the textual rules of construction, \nthe Court sees no one clear answer, then lenity requires \nreversal. Granderson proves the point. There, as here, the \nCourt addressed a question of statutory interpretation \nconcerning sentencing. 511 U.S. at 41. The practical \ndifference between the principal options was a mandatory \n20-month sentence (if the government was correct) or a \nmandatory two-month sentence (if the defendant was \ncorrect). Id. at 41-42. After evaluating the \u201ctext, \nstructure, and history\u201d and finding no clear answer, the \nCourt \u201cappl[ied] the rule of lenity and resolve[d] the \nambiguity in [the defendant\u2019s] favor.\u201d Id. at 54.  \nThe same process is required here. There is no \nquestion that Hewitt must be resentenced. Under our \ninterpretation of section 403(a), he would face a \nmandatory minimum of 25 years. Under the Fifth, Sixth, \nand Eleventh Circuits\u2019 construction, he would face a \nmandatory minimum of longer than 100 years at his \nresentencing. Were there any \u201creasonable doubt\u201d about \nthe construction of section 403(a), that doubt \u201cshould be \nresolved in favor of\u201d Hewitt.

          "task_beliefs": "My model of the case has stabilized around a central, well-defined legal conflict. This observation, being a moment of internal synthesis, did not introduce new external evidence but rather solidified my understanding and sharpened my focus on the remaining critical uncertainty.\n\n*   **Petitioner's Position (Stable):** The petitioner's argument remains anchored to the principle of *de novo* resentencing. The core idea is that a vacated sentence is legally void, meaning the sentencing court must apply the law as it exists at the time of the *new* sentencing hearing. Since the First Step Act was in effect during Hewitt's 2022 resentencing, its prohibition on sentence \"stacking\" should apply. The rule of lenity is a secondary, supporting argument.\n\n*   **Opposing Position (Stable and Central):** The court-appointed amicus brief (Document 16) provides the complete and formidable counterargument. This argument is not based on general principles but on a strict textualist reading of the First Step Act's applicability clause, Section 403(b).\n    *   **The Historical Test:** The amicus argues the statute's text\u2014\"if a sentence for the offense **has not been imposed as of such date of enactment**\"\u2014creates a simple factual test.\n    *   **Plain Meaning:** As a matter of historical fact, a sentence *was* imposed on Hewitt prior to the Act's 2018 enactment date. The amicus contends that the subsequent vacatur of that sentence does not alter this historical fact.\n    *   **Textual Nuances:** The argument highlights Congress's choice of the past-perfect tense (\"has...been imposed\") and the indefinite article (\"a sentence\") to signify a past event, not a continuing legal status.\n    *   **Rejection of Legal Fiction:** The amicus directly confronts the petitioner's reliance on the vacatur principle, arguing that this general legal fiction cannot override the specific, plain text of the statute in question.\n\n*   **Adversarial Structure (Stable):** The parties are definitively identified as **Petitioner & U.S. Government vs. Court-Appointed Amicus**. The Court's appointment of an amicus to defend the lower court's judgment remains a strong signal that the amicus's argument is considered substantial and worthy of full consideration.\n\n*   **Current State of Uncertainty (Refined):** My prediction remains flipped in favor of the amicus and an affirmation of the judgment below, as the textualist argument appears well-aligned with the current Court's methodology. However, this prediction is provisional. The central uncertainty has been narrowed from \"what is the counterargument?\" to a much more specific question: **\"How does the petitioner rebut the amicus's plain-text, historical-fact interpretation of Section 403(b)?\"** My entire model now hinges on the strength of this rebuttal. I have identified a specific document, the **\"REPLY BRIEF FOR PETITIONERS,\"** as the single most valuable piece of evidence to resolve this remaining uncertainty.",
          "design_beliefs": "This observation, representing a strategic planning phase, provides powerful validation for recently developed heuristics and marks an evolution toward a more sophisticated, hypothesis-driven research methodology.\n\n*   **Core Principles (Reinforced):**\n    *   **Model the Adversarial Process:** This principle is now driving my strategy. Understanding the typical sequence of briefs (Petitioner's Brief -> Respondent/Amicus Brief -> Petitioner's Reply Brief) allows me to anticipate the existence and importance of the reply brief as the final piece of the argumentative puzzle.\n\n*   **Applied Principles & Heuristics (Critique and Refinement):**\n    *   **\"Tool Limitation Assessment\" (Stable):** My understanding that the `closed_search` tool is for content retrieval, not structural docket queries, is firm.\n    *   **\"Failed Search as a Signal\" (Vindicated):** This heuristic led directly to the breakthrough discovery of the amicus brief and the service documents, proving its value in turning apparent failures into opportunities.\n    *   **\"Service Documents as a Map\" (Upgraded to Core Strategy):** This heuristic has been spectacularly validated. An \"Affidavit of Service\" (Document 21) not only helped map the case but also explicitly named the \"REPLY BRIEF FOR PETITIONERS,\" giving me a precise, named target for my next action. This proves the heuristic is not just for reconstructing a static map of filings, but for navigating the *procedural flow* of the case to find the next logical document.\n\n*   **Emerging Heuristics / Next Steps (Formalized):**\n    *   **\"Targeted Information Gain Maximization\" (New Formalized Principle):** My strategy has evolved from broad exploration to targeted hypothesis testing. I have a working theory (the amicus's textualist argument will prevail) and have identified the single piece of evidence most likely to challenge or disconfirm it (the petitioner's reply). My next action is now explicitly designed to maximize information gain by seeking out this specific rebuttal. This represents a shift to a more efficient, focused, and truly \"experimental\" design approach, where each action is a deliberate test of a specific aspect of my case model."

          "task_beliefs": "I have successfully retrieved the petitioner's primary merits brief, which provides a complete and detailed architecture for their argument. This has profoundly deepened my understanding of the case, shifting the central conflict from a general principle versus a textual reading to a direct clash between two competing, sophisticated textual interpretations.\n\n*   **Petitioner's Position (Dramatically Enhanced):** My model of the petitioner's argument is no longer a high-level summary but a detailed, multi-pronged attack. The brief (Document 24) reveals they are not ceding the textualist ground to the amicus.\n    *   **The Textual Counter-Argument:** The petitioner directly engages with the text of Section 403(b). Their core assertion is that the phrase \"if a sentence for the offense **has not been imposed as of such date of enactment**\" refers to a sentence with ongoing legal effect as of that date. They argue the present-perfect tense (\"has...been imposed\") combined with the preposition \"as of\" denotes a state that must be true at that specific point in time.\n    *   **The \"Legal Nullity\" Doctrine as a Rule of Interpretation:** The petitioner's argument integrates the long-standing legal principle that a vacated judgment is a \"nullity\" (`void ab initio`) directly into their textual reading. They contend that the term \"a sentence\" in the statute cannot, as a matter of law, refer to something that has been legally nullified. A vacated sentence is treated as if it never existed, therefore it cannot be a \"sentence [that] has...been imposed as of\" the enactment date. They support this with extensive case law, demonstrating it is a deeply embedded background principle of law that Congress is presumed to know.\n    *   **Purposive and Structural Arguments:** The brief argues this reading aligns with Congress's clear intent to end the \"unjust\" and \"irrational\" practice of sentence stacking and to respect the finality of judgments. Since a vacated sentence renders a case non-final and pending, applying the new law is consistent with this purpose.\n    *   **Linguistic Analysis:** The petitioner's citation of grammatical sources like *The Cambridge Grammar of the English Language* signals a readiness to fight the textualist battle on the most granular level, directly challenging the amicus's linguistic interpretation.\n\n*   **Opposing Position (Contextualized):** The court-appointed amicus's argument\u2014that \"has...been imposed\" refers to a simple historical fact that cannot be erased by a subsequent vacatur\u2014remains the primary counterpoint. However, it is no longer the only sophisticated textual argument on the table. The conflict is now a direct battle between two plausible readings of the same statutory text: the amicus's \"historical fact\" reading versus the petitioner's \"ongoing legal status/legal nullity\" reading.\n\n*   **Adversarial Structure (Stable):** The alignment remains **Petitioner & U.S. Government vs. Court-Appointed Amicus**. The petitioner's brief confirms the government's agreement, strengthening their position.\n\n*   **Current State of Uncertainty (Re-balanced and Refined):** My previous prediction, which favored the amicus, is now significantly weakened. The petitioner has presented a formidable textual argument that is not merely an appeal to purpose over text, but an argument about how to read the text itself in light of established legal principles. The case now appears much more evenly balanced, perhaps even tilting slightly back toward the petitioner. The central uncertainty has evolved again. It is no longer \"what is the rebuttal?\" but **\"Which of these two competing textualist interpretations will the Court find more persuasive?\"** The amicus's argument is simpler and more literal; the petitioner's argument is more complex but arguably more consistent with broader legal doctrine concerning the effect of vacated judgments. To resolve this, I still need to see how the petitioner directly parries the amicus's specific points in the **Reply Brief**.",
          "design_beliefs": "This observation was a mixed success that provided critical refinements to my research methodology. While I failed to retrieve my primary target (the reply brief), I obtained an equally valuable document (the merits brief) and learned important lessons about the execution of my strategy.\n\n*   **Core Principles (Reinforced):**\n    *   **Model the Adversarial Process:** This principle is more crucial than ever. My action retrieved the petitioner's opening merits brief instead of their reply brief. This highlights the absolute necessity of understanding the precise procedural sequence of filings (Petitioner Merits Brief -> Respondent/Amicus Brief -> Petitioner Reply Brief) to correctly interpret arguments and target the next most informative document.\n\n*   **Applied Principles & Heuristics (Critique and Refinement):**\n    *   **\"Service Documents as a Map\" (Stable):** This remains a highly effective heuristic for identifying the existence and names of key documents.\n    *   **\"Targeted Information Gain Maximization\" (Refined):** The strategy of identifying a single document to resolve a specific uncertainty remains sound. However, the execution requires more precision. This leads to a new, critical sub-heuristic:\n        *   **\"Verify Document Identity Beyond Title\" (New Heuristic):** My search for a \"reply brief\" returned a \"merits brief.\" I must critically analyze search results, including file names (`...merits20brief...`) and document titles (\"BRIEF FOR PETITIONER...\"), to ensure the retrieved document is the one I intended to find. A failure to verify can lead to misinterpreting the dialectical flow of the case.\n    *   **\"Failed Search as a Signal\" (Refined Application):** My search *failed* to return the reply brief. This is an informative signal. It forces me to question *why*: Was the query flawed? Is the document named something unexpected? This \"failure\" correctly redirects my immediate goal to diagnosing the search problem and re-acquiring the correct target\u2014the reply brief.\n\n*   **Emerging Heuristics / Next Steps (Formalized):**\n    *   **\"Argument Reconstruction is Foundational\" (Vindicated):** This observation proves that a complete model of the case requires a full reconstruction of each party's argument from their primary briefs. My prior understanding of the petitioner's case was a mere sketch; I now have the full blueprint, which has fundamentally changed my assessment of their chances.\n    *   **\"Anticipate the Rebuttal to the Rebuttal\" (Formalized Strategy):** My research process has solidified into a clear, dialectical sequence: 1) Reconstruct the opening argument (Petitioner's Merits Brief). 2) Reconstruct the primary rebuttal (Amicus/Respondent's Brief). 3) Reconstruct the final rebuttal (Petitioner's Reply Brief). My next action must be to execute step 3 successfully, as the reply brief contains the final, and perhaps decisive, word in this argumentative chain."

See BIO 9-10.  \nIn an attempt to trivialize this point, the government \nasserts (at 9) that \u201cthe disagreement in the courts of \nappeals is shallow and recent.\u201d But that is plainly wrong. \n\n2 \n \n \n \n \nThe split is two years old, and it emerged almost immedi-\nately after the FSA was enacted. That the statute spawned \na circuit split nearly from the start is a reason to grant \nreview, not the other way around. In all events, a 2-2 \ndivision of authority that is widely recognized and firmly \nentrenched is plainly worthy of the Court\u2019s attention.  \nThat is especially so here, given that two dozen fed-\neral appellate judges sitting on four circuit courts have \nissued ten fully considered opinions\u2014majorities, concur-\nrences, dissents, and opinions respecting rehearing\u2014that \nhave openly approved or criticized the conflicting views \nof their colleagues all across the country. And that is to \nsay nothing of the unpublished decisions of the Second \nand Fourth Circuits and the on-point opinion of the en \nbanc Seventh Circuit.1 Given the extensive treatment that \nthe question presented already has received, there is \nnothing to be gained from further percolation.  \nThe now-entrenched nature of the circuit split also \nexplains the irrelevance of the denial of review in Carpen-\nter v. United States, No. 23-531. See BIO 9. As we noted \nin the petition (at 1, 6-7), the government there stated that \nit would attempt to resolve the circuit split by acquiescing \n \n1  See Pet. App. 1a-16a; United States v. Carpenter, 80 F.4th 790 (6th \nCir. 2023) (Kethledge, J., concurring in denial of rehearing en banc); \nid. at 793-795 (Griffin, J., dissenting from denial of rehearing en \nbanc); id. at 795-797 (Bloomekatz, J., dissenting from denial of re-\nhearing en banc); United States v. Mitchell, 38 F.4th 382 (3d Cir. \n2022); id. at 392-393 (Bibas, J., concurring in the judgment); United \nStates v. Merrell, 37 F.4th 571 (9th Cir. 2022); id. at 578-579 (Boggs, \nJ., dissenting); United States v. Jackson, 995 F.3d 522 (6th Cir. \n2021); id. at 526-528 (Moore, J., dissenting) United States v. Uri-\narte, 975 F.3d 596 (7th Cir. 2020) (en banc); United States v. Bethea, \n841 F. App\u2019x 544 (4th Cir. 2021); United States v. Walker, 830 F. \nApp\u2019x 12 (2d Cir. 2020). \n\n3 \n \n \n \n \nin en banc rehearing in the Sixth Circuit. But the Sixth \nCircuit rebuffed the government, and the Fifth Circuit has \nsince solidified the conflict beyond any one circuit\u2019s \nability to resolve. This Court is thus the only tribunal that \ncan end the dispute among the lower courts. \n2.  The question presented is exceptionally important. \nTo begin, the sentencing disparities at issue here are  \nhuge. Whether the First Step Act applies to a criminal \ndefendant often makes a difference of decades or cen-\nturies of incarceration. The Court and Congress both have \ncalled out the injustice of \u201cunwarranted sentencing \ndisparities\u201d like this. Dorsey v. United States, 567 U.S. \n260, 277 (2012). For many individuals, the question \npresented is the difference between liberty and detention; \nfor them, it is of utmost importance. \nMoreover, the question arises with great frequency, \nnot only under Section 403 of the Act, but also in cases \nimplicating Section 401. See BIO 12 n.3. Many thousands \nof defendants every year have been subject to the sen-\ntencing enhancements implicated by Sections 401 and \n403. See NACDL Br. 7-8; ACLU Br. 12-14.  \nAlthough it is true that the question presented can \narise only for defendants who committed offenses before \nDecember 2018, the government is wrong to imply (at 12) \nthat the range of cases in which the question presented \narises will meaningfully \u201cdiminish\u201d any time soon. The \nwhole point is that the terms of imprisonment at issue \nhere are many decades, sometimes centuries, long. Thus, \nfor decades to come, the question presented will arise \nevery time there is a change in law that can be raised on \ncollateral review in cases involving convictions that fall \nwithin the reach of Section 401 or  403\u2014which is most \nfederal convictions. NACDL Br. 7-8. \n\n4 \n \n \n \n \nGiven these facts, it is perhaps unsurprising that, just \na few months ago, the government argued to the Sixth \nCircuit that \u201crestoring uniformity among the circuits\u201d on \nthe question presented is a matter \u201cof exceptional impor-\ntance.\u201d See U.S. Rehearing Br. 1-2, Carpenter v. United \nStates, No. 22-1198 (6th Cir. Aug. 7, 2023). It was \ncorrect then, and it is wrong to suggest otherwise now.  \n3. The government makes a final pitch for denial, \nnoting in passing (at 9, 13) that a bill has been introduced \nthat would amend the First Step Act so that it applies \nretroactively. The bill that the government references, the \nFirst Step Implementation Act, was first introduced in \n2021 but died without receiving a floor vote. It was \nreintroduced in the Senate more than one year ago, in \nApril 2023. In the time since, it has not received so much \nas a committee hearing, let alone has it been voted out of \ncommittee, debated on the chamber floor, voted upon by \nthe full Senate, or moved to the House.  \nGiven the approaching end to the 118th Congress, \nthere is no realistic possibility that the bill will be enacted \nbefore it dies again at the end of the year. And it would be \nmanifestly unjust to allow continued misapplication of a \nlaw that has been enacted out of speculative concern for a \nbill that never will be. \nIn circumstances like these, the Court often grants re-\nview notwithstanding a respondent\u2019s assertion that Con-\ngress is currently considering legislation that, if adopted, \nwould affect the question presented.2 That is the approp-\n \n2  See, e.g., BIO 13, Kelly v. Preap, No. 16-1363 (\u201cReview is prema-\nture because Congress is currently considering bills that would mod-\nify the statutory language in question\u201d) (cert. granted March 19, \n2018); BIO 15, United States v. Microsoft Corp., No. 17-2 (\u201cCongress \nis currently considering several proposals\u201d that would provide a \n  \n\n5 \n \n \n \n \nriate course here. In the Fifth and Sixth Circuits, count-\nless individuals are being held incarcerated for decades \ntoo long, in contravention of the plain text and clear pur-\npose of the First Step Act. If their cases had arisen in the \nThird or Ninth Circuits, their sentences would be far \nshorter, and many likely would be free. Such variability in \nthe administration of the federal criminal justice system \nis intolerable. The Court should grant the petition and     \nrestore uniformity on the question presented.  \nRespectfully submitted. \nRussell Wilson II \nLaw Office of \nRussell Wilson II \n1910 Pacific Avenue \nNo. 12050 \nDallas, Texas 75201 \n(469) 573-0211 \n \nMichael B.

All also agree that it deepens at least a 2-2 circuit \nsplit\u2014one that cannot and will not resolve itself. That \nleaves no doubt that the Court should grant the petition \nand reverse, restoring uniformity on the question pre-\nsented and ensuring that the First Step Act is applied \naccording to its plain terms. \nNotwithstanding the Fifth Circuit\u2019s admitted error \nand the Solicitor General\u2019s acknowledgment of a division \nof authority among the courts of appeals, the government \nstrangely resists this Court\u2019s intervention. As the govern-\nment sees it, review is unnecessary because (1) the issue \nhas limited prospective importance and (2) there is a long-\nstalled bill pending before Congress which, if enacted, \nwould amend the First Step Act.  \nNeither assertion is remotely persuasive. If the de-\ncision below is left to stand, untold numbers of indivi-\nduals will continue to be denied often decades-long \nsentence reductions to which they are entitled by law. \nAnd as the government begrudgingly admits, the question \npresented is certain to recur as changes in the law con-\ntinue to crop up. The Court should not delay resolution of \nthe issue any longer.  \n1. The government agrees that the decision below \ndeepens a circuit split: Whereas \u201c[t]he Third and Ninth \nCircuits * * * have both correctly interpreted Section 403 \nto apply at a resentencing held following the Act\u2019s enact-\nment,\u201d the Fifth and Sixth Circuits have reached the op-\nposite conclusion.

The question presented is exceptionally important. \nTo begin, the sentencing disparities at issue here are  \nhuge.

For many individuals, the question \npresented is the difference between liberty and detention; \nfor them, it is of utmost importance. \nMoreover, the question arises with great frequency, \nnot only under Section 403 of the Act, but also in cases \nimplicating Section 401. See BIO 12 n.3. Many thousands \nof defendants every year have been subject to the sen-\ntencing enhancements implicated by Sections 401 and \n403. See NACDL Br. 7-8; ACLU Br. 12-14.  \nAlthough it is true that the question presented can \narise only for defendants who committed offenses before \nDecember 2018, the government is wrong to imply (at 12) \nthat the range of cases in which the question presented \narises will meaningfully \u201cdiminish\u201d any time soon. The \nwhole point is that the terms of imprisonment at issue \nhere are many decades, sometimes centuries, long. Thus, \nfor decades to come, the question presented will arise \nevery time there is a change in law that can be raised on \ncollateral review in cases involving convictions that fall \nwithin the reach of Section 401 or  403\u2014which is most \nfederal convictions. NACDL Br. 7-8. \n\n4 \n \n \n \n \nGiven these facts, it is perhaps unsurprising that, just \na few months ago, the government argued to the Sixth \nCircuit that \u201crestoring uniformity among the circuits\u201d on \nthe question presented is a matter \u201cof exceptional impor-\ntance.\u201d See U.S. Rehearing Br. 1-2, Carpenter v. United \nStates, No. 22-1198 (6th Cir. Aug. 7, 2023). It was \ncorrect then, and it is wrong to suggest otherwise now.  \n3. The government makes a final pitch for denial, \nnoting in passing (at 9, 13) that a bill has been introduced \nthat would amend the First Step Act so that it applies \nretroactively. The bill that the government references, the \nFirst Step Implementation Act, was first introduced in \n2021 but died without receiving a floor vote. It was \nreintroduced in the Senate more than one year ago, in \nApril 2023. In the time since, it has not received so much \nas a committee hearing, let alone has it been voted out of \ncommittee, debated on the chamber floor, voted upon by \nthe full Senate, or moved to the House.  \nGiven the approaching end to the 118th Congress, \nthere is no realistic possibility that the bill will be enacted \nbefore it dies again at the end of the year. And it would be \nmanifestly unjust to allow continued misapplication of a \nlaw that has been enacted out of speculative concern for a \nbill that never will be. \nIn circumstances like these, the Court often grants re-\nview notwithstanding a respondent\u2019s assertion that Con-\ngress is currently considering legislation that, if adopted, \nwould affect the question presented.2 That is the approp-\n \n2  See, e.g., BIO 13, Kelly v. Preap, No. 16-1363 (\u201cReview is prema-\nture because Congress is currently considering bills that would mod-\nify the statutory language in question\u201d) (cert. granted March 19, \n2018); BIO 15, United States v. Microsoft Corp., No. 17-2 (\u201cCongress \nis currently considering several proposals\u201d that would provide a \n  \n\n5 \n \n \n \n \nriate course here. In the Fifth and Sixth Circuits, count-\nless individuals are being held incarcerated for decades \ntoo long, in contravention of the plain text and clear pur-\npose of the First Step Act. If their cases had arisen in the \nThird or Ninth Circuits, their sentences would be far \nshorter, and many likely would be free. Such variability in \nthe administration of the federal criminal justice system \nis intolerable. The Court should grant the petition and     \nrestore uniformity on the question presented.  \nRespectfully submitted. \nRussell Wilson II \nLaw Office of \nRussell Wilson II \n1910 Pacific Avenue \nNo. 12050 \nDallas, Texas 75201 \n(469) 573-0211 \n \nMichael B.

          "task_beliefs": "This observation, being an internal monologue about strategy, introduced no new information about the case itself. Therefore, my understanding of the task parameters remains stable, pending the acquisition of the petitioner's reply brief.\n\n*   **Core Conflict (Stable):** The central issue remains a direct clash between two sophisticated textualist interpretations of the First Step Act's Section 403(b): \"if a sentence for the offense **has not been imposed as of such date of enactment**\".\n    *   **Petitioner's Interpretation:** The petitioner, supported by the U.S. Government, argues that \"a sentence\" refers to a sentence with ongoing legal effect. They integrate the \"legal nullity\" doctrine, contending that a vacated sentence is legally void (`void ab initio`) and thus cannot be considered a \"sentence [that] has...been imposed as of\" the enactment date. This reading is supported by extensive case law on the effect of vacatur and a grammatical analysis of the present-perfect tense (\"has...been imposed\") suggesting a state that must be true *at* the moment of enactment.\n    *   **Amicus's Interpretation:** The court-appointed amicus argues for a simpler, \"historical fact\" reading. In this view, \"has...been imposed\" refers to a past event that occurred, regardless of whether the sentence was later vacated. The vacatur does not erase the historical fact of the imposition.\n\n*   **Adversarial Structure (Stable):** The alignment remains **Petitioner & U.S. Government vs. Court-Appointed Amicus**.\n\n*   **State of Uncertainty (Stable):** My prediction remains finely balanced, having shifted from favoring the amicus to recognizing the formidable strength of the petitioner's textual and structural arguments. The primary uncertainty is no longer about the nature of the arguments but about their persuasiveness to the Court: **Will the Justices favor the amicus's simpler, more literal reading, or the petitioner's more complex interpretation that aligns with background principles of federal court procedure (the legal nullity doctrine)?** Resolving this requires seeing how the petitioner directly confronts the amicus's \"historical fact\" argument, which will be found in their reply brief.",
          "design_beliefs": "This `THINK` observation is a pure and powerful update to my design-level beliefs. It represents a critical moment of self-correction and strategic refinement, demonstrating how to learn from and adapt to execution failures in information gathering.\n\n*   **Core Principles (Reinforced):**\n    *   **Model the Adversarial Process:** This remains the guiding principle. The agent's internal reasoning explicitly recognizes the need for the reply brief to complete the dialectical model (Argument -> Rebuttal -> Final Rebuttal). The entire purpose of the refined search strategy is to get back on track with this core principle.\n\n*   **Applied Principles & Heuristics (Critique and Refinement):**\n    *   **\"Service Documents as a Map\" (Stable):** Remains a valid heuristic for identifying key documents.\n    *   **\"Failed Search as a Signal\" (Vindicated and Applied):** This observation is the perfect embodiment of this heuristic in action. The previous failure was not just an error; it was a signal that the search methodology was too brittle. The agent correctly diagnosed the problem (overly specific query) and is now acting on that signal to improve its method.\n    *   **\"Verify Document Identity Beyond Title\" (Reinforced):** The pain of the previous error (retrieving the wrong brief) reinforces the importance of this verification step.\n    *   **\"Targeted Information Gain Maximization\" (Refined Execution):** The strategy of targeting the document with the highest expected information gain (the reply brief) is sound. This observation refines the *execution* of that strategy. It shows that effective targeting requires not just identifying the right document but also formulating a robust query to retrieve it. This leads to a new, concrete heuristic:\n        *   **\"Generalize Search Queries for Robustness\" (New Heuristic):** My previous search failed because `{'proceeding_title': 'Reply Brief for Petitioner'}` was too precise. The new strategy to search for a document where the title simply *contains* 'reply' is a move from brittle precision to robust generalization. This is a crucial lesson: search queries should be specific enough to be relevant but general enough to accommodate minor variations in naming conventions.\n\n*   **Emerging Heuristics / Next Steps (Solidified):**\n    *   **\"Argument Reconstruction is Foundational\" (Stable):** My current state of high uncertainty, despite having the petitioner's main brief, proves that partial reconstruction is insufficient. A complete model requires all primary briefs.\n    *   **\"Anticipate the Rebuttal to the Rebuttal\" (Reaffirmed):** The agent's singular focus on obtaining the reply brief confirms this as the correct next step. The entire purpose of this `THINK` action is to enable the successful execution of this dialectical research strategy. The process is now a clear, self-correcting loop: plan the next step in the dialectic, execute a search, and if it fails, diagnose the failure and refine the search methodology before trying again."

Successfully retrieving it will provide a massive update to my belief about the likely winner of the textualist debate, making the Task EIG extremely high.

App. 1a-16a) is pub-\nlished at 92 F.4th 304. \nJURISDICTION \nThe Fifth Circuit entered judgment on February 2, \n2024. Petitioner filed a petition for a writ of certiorari on \nMarch 8, 2024, which the Court granted on July 2, 2024. \nThe Court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254(1). \nSTATUTORY PROVISION INVOLVED \nThe relevant provisions of the First Step Act of 2018, \nPub. L. No. 115-391, 132 Stat. 5194, are reproduced in the \npetition appendix at pages 17a-21a. \nINTRODUCTION \nSection 924(c) of title 18 of the U.S. Code authorizes \ndrastic mandatory minimum sentences for those who \ncommit certain federal crimes while carrying, brandish-\ning, or discharging a firearm. For first offenses, it calls for \na mandatory minimum sentence between five and ten \nyears\u2019 imprisonment. For second or subsequent offenses, \nthat number jumps to 25 years. The statute requires that \nthe sentence for each section 924(c) count run consecu-\ntively with any other sentence. \nIn Deal v. United States, 508 U.S. 129 (1993), the \nCourt held that section 924(c), as originally enacted, \nrequired imposition of the 25-year mandatory minimum if \na defendant was convicted of multiple section 924(c) \ncounts in a single criminal proceeding. Thus, even a first-\ntime offender, if charged with multiple section 924(c) \ncounts, could face multiple 25-year sentences, running \nconsecutively. This effect, which often resulted in de facto \nlife sentences for first-time offenders, came to be known \nas \u201cstacking.\u201d \nStacking was widely regarded as unjust and irration-\nal. As one district court noted, a first-time, nonviolent \noffender who carried a firearm during a string of simple \n\n2 \n \ndrug sales would face more prison time than a murderer. \nCongress finally answered the calls for corrective action \nwith the First Step Act of 2018 (FSA). A principal aim of \nthe law was to end stacking. To that end, section 403(a) \nof the FSA amended section 924(c) to abrogate Deal, so \nthat the statute now permits enhanced sentences only \n\u201c[i]n the case of a violation of this subsection that occurs \nafter a prior conviction under this subsection has become \nfinal.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c). As a result, now only true \nrecidivists may be sentenced to section 924(c)\u2019s enhan-\nced 25-year mandatory minimum. \nBut under 1 U.S.C. \u00a7 109, the default rule for such \nsentencing reforms is that they apply only to crimes com-\nmitted after enactment. Appreciating the grave injustice \nthat would result if stacking were allowed to continue in \npost-enactment sentencings for pre-enactment conduct, \nCongress overrode the default rule, making section \n403(a)\u2019s sentencing reform retroactive. It thus adopted \nsection 403(b), which specifies that section 403(a) \u201cshall \napply to any offense that was committed before the date \nof enactment of this Act, if a sentence for the offense has \nnot been imposed as of such date of enactment.\u201d  \nAll agree that this language makes section 403(a) \nrelief available to a defendant who committed an offense \npre-enactment but is sentenced post-enactment. All also \nagree that it does not make relief available to anyone who \ncommitted an offense pre-enactment and whose sentence \nand judgment of conviction were final on the date of \nenactment and remain so today. The only question here is \nwhether it makes section 403(a) relief available to a \ndefendant who was sentenced pre-enactment, but whose \ninitial sentence was thereafter vacated, rendering the \ninitial sentence void ab initio and necessitating post-\nenactment plenary resentencing. \nThe plain text of section 403(b) supplies the answer: \nIt does. As a starting point, \u201ca sentence for the offense\u201d \n\n3 \n \ndoes not\u2014cannot\u2014include a sentence that has been \nvacated. A vacated sentence is a nullity, one treated by \noperation of law as never having been imposed. The point \nof vacatur is to ensure that the object has no legal effect \nand works no ongoing prejudice. Congress is presumed to \nunderstand and incorporate background legal principles \nlike this and thus could not have intended \u201ca sentence\u201d to \ninclude a vacated sentence. \nThis is confirmed by the statutory context, including \nthe verb tense and preposition that Congress used. The \npresent-perfect tense, used together with the preposition \n\u201cas of,\u201d indicates that Congress sought to deny section \n403(a)\u2019s reforms only to those defendants whose judg-\nments of conviction were final on the date of enactment \nand remain so today. As the government now agrees, no \nordinary English speaker would say that a sentence \u201chas \nbeen imposed as of December 21, 2018\u201d if the sentence \nwas vacated and no longer has any force or effect.  \nReading section 403(b) as drawing a line between \npending and past cases reflects Congress\u2019s evident desire \nto respect the finality of judgments. But finality is not an \nissue when a judgment is vacated for reasons independent \nof the FSA; such a case is \u201cpending\u201d like any other. That \nis confirmed by post-vacatur practice, which calls for an \nentirely new, de novo proceeding at which Congress could \nnot have intended stacking to remain available.  \nNone of the contrary rationales supplied by the court \nbelow or by the Sixth and Eleventh Circuits is persuasive. \nThose courts\u2019 rationales would revise the statute\u2019s \nlanguage and blinder the Court to the statute\u2019s context, \nstructure, and manifest purpose, reading section 403(b) \nto defeat Congress\u2019s design rather than to conform to it. \nThis Court\u2019s cases require no such result. If there were \nany doubt about that, the rule of lenity would require \nresolving it in petitioner\u2019s favor and thus reversing the \ndecision below. \n\n4 \n \nSTATEMENT \nA. Legal background \n1. Section 924(c) of title 18 of the U.S. Code crim-\ninalizes the use, carrying, or possession of a firearm in \nconnection with a \u201ccrime of violence or drug trafficking \ncrime.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A).  \nConviction for a first section 924(c) violation carries \na mandatory minimum sentence of five years for offenders \nwho carry or possess a firearm during a crime of violence \nor a drug trafficking crime. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A)(i). \nAs originally enacted and through December 21, 2018, a \nconviction for a \u201csecond or subsequent\u201d 924(c) violation \ncarried a mandatory minimum sentence of 25 years. Id. \n\u00a7 924(c)(1)(C). Moreover, when a defendant is convicted \nof violating section 924(c), the statute\u2019s mandatory \nminimum sentence must run consecutively rather than \nconcurrently \u201cwith any other term of imprisonment.\u201d Id. \n\u00a7 924(c)(1)(D)(ii).  \nIn Deal v. United States, 508 U.S. 129 (1993), the \nCourt interpreted section 924(c)\u2019s \u201csecond or subse-\nquent\u201d language to apply to multiple 924(c) convictions \nobtained in a single criminal proceeding. See 508 U.S. at \n134 (rejecting the contention that that section \u201c924(c)(1) \nmust be read to impose the enhanced sentence only for an \noffense committed after a previous sentence has become \nfinal\u201d). In other words, according to the Court, a \ndefendant could commit an initial and \u201csubsequent\u201d \noffense as part of a single criminal transaction prosecuted \nin a single case. The Court thus rejected the notion that \nsection 924(c) was intended to punish only recidivists \nand held that a defendant with no prior criminal history \ncould receive enhanced, consecutive sentences for each \nsection 924(c) count charged. Ibid. \nGiven its lengthy minimum consecutive penalties, \nsection 924(c) threatened exceptionally \u201clong prison sen-\n\n5 \n \ntences for anyone who uses a firearm in connection with \ncertain other federal crimes.\u201d United States v. Davis, 588 \nU.S. 445, 448 (2019). The practice of \u201ccharging multiple \nviolations of section 924(c) within the same indictment\u201d \nbecame known as \u201cstacking.\u201d See U.S. Sentencing Com-\nmission, Mandatory Minimum Penalties for Firearm \nOffenses in the Federal Criminal Justice System 271 (Oct. \n2011) (hereinafter USSC Report). Because each count \nbeyond the first was subject to the enhanced 25-year \nminimum penalty, stacking often resulted in de facto life \nsentences for first-time section 924(c) offenders\u2014often \nseveral hundred years\u2019 imprisonment imposed all at once. \nAs one court noted, a first-time offender frequently would \nreceive a lighter sentence \u201cif he had committed murder\u201d \nrather than a series of nonviolent drug sales while carry-\ning a firearm. United States v. Holloway, 68 F. Supp. 3d \n310, 313 (E.D.N.Y. 2014). \nStacking was widely criticized as unjust. District \njudges\u2014those on the front lines of the federal criminal \njustice system\u2014objected to having to impose what they \nviewed as drastic and disproportionate sentences for first-\ntime (and often nonviolent) offenders. See, e.g., United \nStates v. Angelos, 345 F. Supp. 2d 1227, 1230-33 (D. Utah \n2004) (having to sentence the defendant, a \u201ctwenty-four-\nyear-old first offender who is a successful music execu-\ntive with two young children,\u201d to \u201cprison for the rest of \nhis life is unjust, cruel, and even irrational\u201d). \nCircuit judges likewise expressed great discomfort \nhaving to affirm \u201cirrational, inhumane, and absurd\u201d \nsentences that were \u201ca predictable by-product of the cruel \nand unjust mandatory minimum sentencing scheme \nadopted by Congress.\u201d United States v. Hungerford, 465 \nF.3d 1113, 1118 (9th Cir. 2006) (Reinhardt, J., con-\ncurring); see also, e.g., United States v. Hunter, 770 F.3d \n740, 746-747 (8th Cir. 2014) (Bright, J., concurring) \n(decrying the sentence imposed as \u201cout of this world\u201d and \n\n6 \n \n\u201cjoin[ing] in the litany of criticisms directed towards\u201d the \n\u201coverly harsh\u201d practice of sentence stacking). \nJudges and commentators observed that, beyond the \nundue harshness of mandatory minimum sentences, the \nlaw also produced wildly divergent sentencing outcomes \nbased on mere geography\u2014prosecutors in some jurisdic-\ntions used stacking as a matter of course, while others \nmore often avoided it. See In re Hernandez, 857 F.3d \n1162, 1169 (11th Cir. 2017) (Martin, J., concurring) \n(explaining that the defendant \u201cmight never have \nreceived this sentence if he had been sentenced in another \npart of the country\u201d). And prosecutors frequently used \nthe threat of stacked sentences to induce defendants to \naccept plea deals, thus forfeiting their Sixth Amendment \nright to a jury trial, adding constitutional insult to \nstatutory injury. See Human Rights Watch, An Offer You \nCan\u2019t Refuse: How US Federal Prosecutors Force Drug \nDefendants to Plead Guilty (2013). \nAmong those calling for reform was the Sentencing \nCommission itself. USSC Report 359-362. In a report to \nCongress, the Commission explained that \u201c[t]he \u2018stack-\ning\u2019 of mandatory minimum penalties for multiple viola-\ntions of section 924(c) results in excessively severe and \nunjust sentences in some cases.\u201d Id. at 359. In many of \nthose cases, \u201cthe offense did not involve any physical \nharm or threat of physical harm to a person.\u201d Ibid. The \nCommission noted that the Judicial Conference had, on \nmultiple occasions, urged Congress \u201cto amend the \n\u2018draconian\u2019 penalties established at section 924(c).\u201d Id. \nat 360-361 (quoting Mandatory Minimums and Unin-\ntended Consequences: Hearing on H.R. 2934, H.R. 834, \nand H.R. 1466 Before the Subcommittee on Crime, \nTerrorism, and Homeland Security of the House Commit-\ntee on the Judiciary, 111th Cong. 35 (2009)); see also \nHearing Before the Over-Criminalization Task Force of \n2014 of the House Committee on the Judiciary, 113th \n\n7 \n \nCong. 23 (2014) (testimony of Hon. Irene M. Keeley, \nJudicial Conference of the United States). \n2. Although it took several attempts over nearly a \ndecade, Congress finally heeded the Sentencing Commis-\nsion\u2019s call to action in 2018. Late that year, it enacted and \nPresident Trump signed the First Step Act, which was the \n\u201cproduct of a remarkable bipartisan effort.\u201d United States \nv. Henry, 983 F.3d 214, 218 (6th Cir. 2020). The \nculmination of work by an \u201cextraordinary political coali-\ntion\u201d (164 Cong. Rec. S7645 (daily ed. Dec. 17, 2018) \n(statement of Sen. Durbin)), the FSA made \u201conce-in-a-\ngeneration reforms to America\u2019s prison and sentencing \nsystem\u201d (Senate Passes Landmark Criminal Justice \nReform, U.S. Senate Committee on the Judiciary (Dec. \n18, 2018)). \nSection 403 of the FSA addresses sentence stacking. \nIts well-recognized purpose is \u201cto remedy past over-\nzealous use of mandatory-minimum sentences\u201d under \nsection 924(c). Henry, 983 F.3d at 218. To that end, \nsection 403(a) amends section 924(c) to clarify that the\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

App. 1a-16a) is pub-\nlished at 92 F.4th 304. \nJURISDICTION \nThe Fifth Circuit entered judgment on February 2, \n2024. Petitioner filed a petition for a writ of certiorari on \nMarch 8, 2024, which the Court granted on July 2, 2024. \nThe Court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254(1). \nSTATUTORY PROVISION INVOLVED \nThe relevant provisions of the First Step Act of 2018, \nPub. L. No. 115-391, 132 Stat. 5194, are reproduced in the \npetition appendix at pages 17a-21a. \nINTRODUCTION \nSection 924(c) of title 18 of the U.S. Code authorizes \ndrastic mandatory minimum sentences for those who \ncommit certain federal crimes while carrying, brandish-\ning, or discharging a firearm. For first offenses, it calls for \na mandatory minimum sentence between five and ten \nyears\u2019 imprisonment. For second or subsequent offenses, \nthat number jumps to 25 years. The statute requires that \nthe sentence for each section 924(c) count run consecu-\ntively with any other sentence. \nIn Deal v. United States, 508 U.S. 129 (1993), the \nCourt held that section 924(c), as originally enacted, \nrequired imposition of the 25-year mandatory minimum if \na defendant was convicted of multiple section 924(c) \ncounts in a single criminal proceeding. Thus, even a first-\ntime offender, if charged with multiple section 924(c) \ncounts, could face multiple 25-year sentences, running \nconsecutively. This effect, which often resulted in de facto \nlife sentences for first-time offenders, came to be known \nas \u201cstacking.\u201d \nStacking was widely regarded as unjust and irration-\nal. As one district court noted, a first-time, nonviolent \noffender who carried a firearm during a string of simple \n\n2 \n \ndrug sales would face more prison time than a murderer. \nCongress finally answered the calls for corrective action \nwith the First Step Act of 2018 (FSA). A principal aim of \nthe law was to end stacking. To that end, section 403(a) \nof the FSA amended section 924(c) to abrogate Deal, so \nthat the statute now permits enhanced sentences only \n\u201c[i]n the case of a violation of this subsection that occurs \nafter a prior conviction under this subsection has become \nfinal.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c). As a result, now only true \nrecidivists may be sentenced to section 924(c)\u2019s enhan-\nced 25-year mandatory minimum. \nBut under 1 U.S.C. \u00a7 109, the default rule for such \nsentencing reforms is that they apply only to crimes com-\nmitted after enactment. Appreciating the grave injustice \nthat would result if stacking were allowed to continue in \npost-enactment sentencings for pre-enactment conduct, \nCongress overrode the default rule, making section \n403(a)\u2019s sentencing reform retroactive. It thus adopted \nsection 403(b), which specifies that section 403(a) \u201cshall \napply to any offense that was committed before the date \nof enactment of this Act, if a sentence for the offense has \nnot been imposed as of such date of enactment.\u201d  \nAll agree that this language makes section 403(a) \nrelief available to a defendant who committed an offense \npre-enactment but is sentenced post-enactment. All also \nagree that it does not make relief available to anyone who \ncommitted an offense pre-enactment and whose sentence \nand judgment of conviction were final on the date of \nenactment and remain so today. The only question here is \nwhether it makes section 403(a) relief available to a \ndefendant who was sentenced pre-enactment, but whose \ninitial sentence was thereafter vacated, rendering the \ninitial sentence void ab initio and necessitating post-\nenactment plenary resentencing. \nThe plain text of section 403(b) supplies the answer: \nIt does. As a starting point, \u201ca sentence for the offense\u201d \n\n3 \n \ndoes not\u2014cannot\u2014include a sentence that has been \nvacated. A vacated sentence is a nullity, one treated by \noperation of law as never having been imposed. The point \nof vacatur is to ensure that the object has no legal effect \nand works no ongoing prejudice. Congress is presumed to \nunderstand and incorporate background legal principles \nlike this and thus could not have intended \u201ca sentence\u201d to \ninclude a vacated sentence. \nThis is confirmed by the statutory context, including \nthe verb tense and preposition that Congress used. The \npresent-perfect tense, used together with the preposition \n\u201cas of,\u201d indicates that Congress sought to deny section \n403(a)\u2019s reforms only to those defendants whose judg-\nments of conviction were final on the date of enactment \nand remain so today. As the government now agrees, no \nordinary English speaker would say that a sentence \u201chas \nbeen imposed as of December 21, 2018\u201d if the sentence \nwas vacated and no longer has any force or effect.  \nReading section 403(b) as drawing a line between \npending and past cases reflects Congress\u2019s evident desire \nto respect the finality of judgments. But finality is not an \nissue when a judgment is vacated for reasons independent \nof the FSA; such a case is \u201cpending\u201d like any other. That \nis confirmed by post-vacatur practice, which calls for an \nentirely new, de novo proceeding at which Congress could \nnot have intended stacking to remain available.  \nNone of the contrary rationales supplied by the court \nbelow or by the Sixth and Eleventh Circuits is persuasive. \nThose courts\u2019 rationales would revise the statute\u2019s \nlanguage and blinder the Court to the statute\u2019s context, \nstructure, and manifest purpose, reading section 403(b) \nto defeat Congress\u2019s design rather than to conform to it. \nThis Court\u2019s cases require no such result. If there were \nany doubt about that, the rule of lenity would require \nresolving it in petitioner\u2019s favor and thus reversing the \ndecision below. \n\n4 \n \nSTATEMENT \nA. Legal background \n1. Section 924(c) of title 18 of the U.S. Code crim-\ninalizes the use, carrying, or possession of a firearm in \nconnection with a \u201ccrime of violence or drug trafficking \ncrime.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A).  \nConviction for a first section 924(c) violation carries \na mandatory minimum sentence of five years for offenders \nwho carry or possess a firearm during a crime of violence \nor a drug trafficking crime. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A)(i). \nAs originally enacted and through December 21, 2018, a \nconviction for a \u201csecond or subsequent\u201d 924(c) violation \ncarried a mandatory minimum sentence of 25 years. Id. \n\u00a7 924(c)(1)(C). Moreover, when a defendant is convicted \nof violating section 924(c), the statute\u2019s mandatory \nminimum sentence must run consecutively rather than \nconcurrently \u201cwith any other term of imprisonment.\u201d Id. \n\u00a7 924(c)(1)(D)(ii).  \nIn Deal v. United States, 508 U.S. 129 (1993), the \nCourt interpreted section 924(c)\u2019s \u201csecond or subse-\nquent\u201d language to apply to multiple 924(c) convictions \nobtained in a single criminal proceeding. See 508 U.S. at \n134 (rejecting the contention that that section \u201c924(c)(1) \nmust be read to impose the enhanced sentence only for an \noffense committed after a previous sentence has become \nfinal\u201d). In other words, according to the Court, a \ndefendant could commit an initial and \u201csubsequent\u201d \noffense as part of a single criminal transaction prosecuted \nin a single case. The Court thus rejected the notion that \nsection 924(c) was intended to punish only recidivists \nand held that a defendant with no prior criminal history \ncould receive enhanced, consecutive sentences for each \nsection 924(c) count charged. Ibid. \nGiven its lengthy minimum consecutive penalties, \nsection 924(c) threatened exceptionally \u201clong prison sen-\n\n5 \n \ntences for anyone who uses a firearm in connection with \ncertain other federal crimes.\u201d United States v. Davis, 588 \nU.S. 445, 448 (2019). The practice of \u201ccharging multiple \nviolations of section 924(c) within the same indictment\u201d \nbecame known as \u201cstacking.\u201d See U.S. Sentencing Com-\nmission, Mandatory Minimum Penalties for Firearm \nOffenses in the Federal Criminal Justice System 271 (Oct. \n2011) (hereinafter USSC Report). Because each count \nbeyond the first was subject to the enhanced 25-year \nminimum penalty, stacking often resulted in de facto life \nsentences for first-time section 924(c) offenders\u2014often \nseveral hundred years\u2019 imprisonment imposed all at once. \nAs one court noted, a first-time offender frequently would \nreceive a lighter sentence \u201cif he had committed murder\u201d \nrather than a series of nonviolent drug sales while carry-\ning a firearm. United States v. Holloway, 68 F. Supp. 3d \n310, 313 (E.D.N.Y. 2014). \nStacking was widely criticized as unjust. District \njudges\u2014those on the front lines of the federal criminal \njustice system\u2014objected to having to impose what they \nviewed as drastic and disproportionate sentences for first-\ntime (and often nonviolent) offenders. See, e.g., United \nStates v. Angelos, 345 F. Supp. 2d 1227, 1230-33 (D. Utah \n2004) (having to sentence the defendant, a \u201ctwenty-four-\nyear-old first offender who is a successful music execu-\ntive with two young children,\u201d to \u201cprison for the rest of \nhis life is unjust, cruel, and even irrational\u201d). \nCircuit judges likewise expressed great discomfort \nhaving to affirm \u201cirrational, inhumane, and absurd\u201d \nsentences that were \u201ca predictable by-product of the cruel \nand unjust mandatory minimum sentencing scheme \nadopted by Congress.\u201d United States v. Hungerford, 465 \nF.3d 1113, 1118 (9th Cir. 2006) (Reinhardt, J., con-\ncurring); see also, e.g., United States v. Hunter, 770 F.3d \n740, 746-747 (8th Cir. 2014) (Bright, J., concurring) \n(decrying the sentence imposed as \u201cout of this world\u201d and \n\n6 \n \n\u201cjoin[ing] in the litany of criticisms directed towards\u201d the \n\u201coverly harsh\u201d practice of sentence stacking). \nJudges and commentators observed that, beyond the \nundue harshness of mandatory minimum sentences, the \nlaw also produced wildly divergent sentencing outcomes \nbased on mere geography\u2014prosecutors in some jurisdic-\ntions used stacking as a matter of course, while others \nmore often avoided it. See In re Hernandez, 857 F.3d \n1162, 1169 (11th Cir. 2017) (Martin, J., concurring) \n(explaining that the defendant \u201cmight never have \nreceived this sentence if he had been sentenced in another \npart of the country\u201d). And prosecutors frequently used \nthe threat of stacked sentences to induce defendants to \naccept plea deals, thus forfeiting their Sixth Amendment \nright to a jury trial, adding constitutional insult to \nstatutory injury. See Human Rights Watch, An Offer You \nCan\u2019t Refuse: How US Federal Prosecutors Force Drug \nDefendants to Plead Guilty (2013). \nAmong those calling for reform was the Sentencing \nCommission itself. USSC Report 359-362. In a report to \nCongress, the Commission explained that \u201c[t]he \u2018stack-\ning\u2019 of mandatory minimum penalties for multiple viola-\ntions of section 924(c) results in excessively severe and \nunjust sentences in some cases.\u201d Id. at 359. In many of \nthose cases, \u201cthe offense did not involve any physical \nharm or threat of physical harm to a person.\u201d Ibid. The \nCommission noted that the Judicial Conference had, on \nmultiple occasions, urged Congress \u201cto amend the \n\u2018draconian\u2019 penalties established at section 924(c).\u201d Id. \nat 360-361 (quoting Mandatory Minimums and Unin-\ntended Consequences: Hearing on H.R. 2934, H.R. 834, \nand H.R. 1466 Before the Subcommittee on Crime, \nTerrorism, and Homeland Security of the House Commit-\ntee on the Judiciary, 111th Cong. 35 (2009)); see also \nHearing Before the Over-Criminalization Task Force of \n2014 of the House Committee on the Judiciary, 113th \n\n7 \n \nCong. 23 (2014) (testimony of Hon.

Although it took several attempts over nearly a \ndecade, Congress finally heeded the Sentencing Commis-\nsion\u2019s call to action in 2018. Late that year, it enacted and \nPresident Trump signed the First Step Act, which was the \n\u201cproduct of a remarkable bipartisan effort.\u201d United States \nv. Henry, 983 F.3d 214, 218 (6th Cir. 2020). The \nculmination of work by an \u201cextraordinary political coali-\ntion\u201d (164 Cong. Rec. S7645 (daily ed. Dec. 17, 2018) \n(statement of Sen. Durbin)), the FSA made \u201conce-in-a-\ngeneration reforms to America\u2019s prison and sentencing \nsystem\u201d (Senate Passes Landmark Criminal Justice \nReform, U.S. Senate Committee on the Judiciary (Dec. \n18, 2018)). \nSection 403 of the FSA addresses sentence stacking. \nIts well-recognized purpose is \u201cto remedy past over-\nzealous use of mandatory-minimum sentences\u201d under \nsection 924(c). Henry, 983 F.3d at 218. To that end, \nsection 403(a) amends section 924(c) to clarify that the \n25-year mandatory minimum sentence applies only for \nviolations \u201coccur[ing] after a prior\u201d section 924(c) \nconviction \u201chas become final,\u201d effectively overruling \nDeal. See Oversight Hearing on the Federal Bureau of \nPrisons and Implementation of the First Step Act: Hearing \nBefore the Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, and Home-\nland Security of the House Committee on the Judiciary, \n116th Cong. 2 (2019) (statement of Rep. Karen Bass) \n(describing section 403 as \u201celiminat[ing] the ability to \nstack firearm enhancements within the same indictment, \nwhich has historically resulted in excessive sentences\u201d).  \nWithout stacked 25-year sentences, first-time offen-\nders convicted of multiple violations of section 924(c) at \nonce will receive consecutive five-year minimum sen-\ntences, rather than one five-year sentence and one or more \n25-year sentences.  \n\n8 \n \n3. By default, a change in sentencing law is prospec-\ntive only. That is so by statute\u20141 U.S.C. \u00a7 109 specifies \nthat a \u201cnew criminal statute [that amends or repeals] an \nolder criminal statute shall not change the penalties \n\u2018incurred\u2019 under that older statute \u2018unless the repealing \nAct shall so expressly provide.\u2019\u201d Dorsey v. United States, \n567 U.S. 260, 272 (2012) (quoting 1 U.S.C. \u00a7 109). For \nthis purpose, \u201cpenalties are \u2018incurred\u2019 under the older \nstatute when an offender * * * commits the underlying \nconduct that makes the offender liable.\u201d Ibid. \nBut by late 2018, Congress knew well how wide-\nspread and problematic sentence stacking had become. \nLawmakers thus added section 403(b) to the FSA. It \nspecifies that section 403(a)\u2019s amendment of section \n924(c) shall apply not only to future offenders, but also to \npast offenders whose criminal cases remain pending: \nApplicability to Pending Cases.\u2014This sec-\ntion, and the amendments made by this section, \nshall apply to any offense that was committed \nbefore the date of enactment of this Act, if a \nsentence for the offense has not been imposed as \nof such date of enactment. \nCongress thus extended section 403(a) relief to all crim-\ninal defendants whose sentence \u201chas not been imposed as \nof\u201d December 21, 2018.1  \nIn contrast, Congress did not make section 403(a) a \nbasis for reducing the sentence of a defendant whose case \nwas and remains subject to a final criminal judgment. \nInstead, it provided limited alternative relief through \n \n1  Section 401, which reduces mandatory minimum sentences for \nvarious federal drug offenses, uses identical language. Because \nsections 403(b) and 401(c) use the same language, the lower courts \n\u201chave construed them to have the same meaning.\u201d United States v. \nBethea, 841 F. App\u2019x 544, 548 n.5 (4th Cir. 2021); accord United \nStates v. Mitchell, 38 F.4th 382, 389 (3d Cir. 2022). \n\n9 \n \nsection 404 to \u201cdefendants previously sentenced\u201d in a \nfinal judgment, which this Court addressed three Terms \nago in Concepcion v. United States, 597 U.S. 481 (2022). \nUnder certain circumstances, section 404 authorizes \nsentence-reduction motions, which are a more limited \nform of sentencing relief than plenary resentencing \nfollowing a vacatur. See Dillon v. United States, 560 U.S. \n817, 830 (2010).  \nB. Factual and procedural background \n1. Petitioner Tony Hewitt and his co-defendants \nwere convicted on various charges relating to a series of \nbank robberies in 2008. The district court originally \nsentenced Hewitt to 355 years of imprisonment, the bulk \nof which corresponded to a number of stacked section \n924(c) counts. United States v. Duffey, 456 F. App\u2019x 434, \n438-439 (5th Cir. 2012); Judgment, No. 3:08-cv-167, \nDkt. 374 (N.D. Tex. May 7, 2010). The Fifth Circuit \nreversed the convictions in part and vacated Hewitt\u2019s \nsentence due to an error not relevant here. Duffey, 456 F. \nApp\u2019x at 444. On remand, the district court resentenced \nHewitt to 305 years\u2014275 years of which corresponded to \nmandatory 25-year consecutive sentences for second or \nsubsequent 924(c) convictions. The Fifth Circuit af-\nfirmed. United States v. Ross, 582 F. App\u2019x 528, 530 (5th \nCir. 2014); Amended Judgment, No. 3:08-cv-167, Dkt. \n524 (N.D. Tex. Dec. 6, 2012).  \nIn 2019\u2014after the FSA\u2019s enactment\u2014this Court \nheld that section 924(c)\u2019s \u201cresidual clause\u201d is uncon-\nstitutionally vague. Davis, 588 U.S. at 448. Following \nDavis, conspiracy-based charges no longer support \nconvictions under section 924(c). Given that several of \nHewitt\u2019s convictions were predicated on conspiracy to \ncommit bank robbery, Hewitt moved the Fifth Circuit for \nauthorization to file a successive section 2255 habeas \npetition. Pet. App. 3a. The Fifth Circuit granted leave. \n\n10 \n \nIbid. The district court, in turn, vacated the conspiracy-\nbased section 924(c) convictions, vacated the sentence on \nthe \nremaining \nconvictions, \nand \nordered \nplenary \nresentencing. Ibid.  \n2. The case returned to the district court for de novo \nresentencing, but the new presentence report prepared in \nHewitt\u2019s case did not account for section 403(a)\u2019s inter-\nvening amendment of section 924(c). Pet. App. 3a-4a. \nHewitt thus objected to the report, arguing that section \n403(a) should apply. Ibid. The difference, he observed, \nwas substantial: Under the law in place at the time of his \noriginal sentencing, his minimum sentence for the re-\nmaining section 924(c) counts would be 105 years, still \neffectively a life sentence. Under section 403(a) of the \nFSA, the combined mandatory minimum is 25 years.  \nHewitt\u2019s co-defendants raised the same objections. \nAs to them, the government took the position that section \n403 was inapplicable on resentencing because the initial \nsentence for each had been imposed before the FSA\u2019s date \nof enactment. But by the time of Hewitt\u2019s resentencing, \nthe government had reversed its course and requested \napplication of section 403(a) at Hewitt\u2019s resentencing. \nSee Sentencing Tr., No. 3:08-cv-167, Dkt. 785 at 19:8-16 \n(N.D. Tex. Jan. 17, 2023). \nThe district court rejected Hewitt\u2019s and the \ngovernment\u2019s position. Id. at 22:18-23:5. The court \nreasoned that even when a sentence has been vacated, \n\u201cit\u2019s not vacated for purposes of the statute.\u201d Id. at \n22:25-23:1. It thus held that section 403(a) does not \napply and sentenced Hewitt to a 165-year term of im-\nprisonment, 105 of which corresponded to stacked \nsection 924(c) sentences. Pet. App. 5a; see Judgment on \nResentencing, No. 3:08-cv-167, Dkt. 780 (N.D. Tex. Nov. \n8, 2022).  \n\n11 \n \n3. The Fifth Circuit affirmed. See Pet. App. 1a-16a. \nBefore the court of appeals, Hewitt and the government \nagain both argued that section 403(a) should apply at \nresentencing following the judicial vacatur of a pre-FSA \nsentence. Pet. App. 7a. The Fifth Circuit nonetheless con-\ncluded that section 403(b) bars relief for Hewitt and his \ncodefendants. Pet. App. 6a. \nWhile the Fifth Circuit acknowledged that the phrase \n\u201chas not been imposed\u201d is an example of \u201cpresent-perfect \ntense,\u201d the court focused predominantly on the word \n\u201cimposed.\u201d Pet. App. 7a. It reasoned that whether a \nsentence has been imposed \u201cappears to hinge on a district \ncourt\u2019s action or inaction\u201d as a singular point in time, and \n\u201cnot on a defendant\u2019s status.\u201d Pet. App. 8a. It thus held \nthat section 403(b)\u2019s focus is on the one-time historical \nfact of a sentence\u2019s imposition. Ibid. Because Hewitt had \nbeen sentenced before the FSA\u2019s enactment as a matter of \nhistorical fact, it held relief under section 403(a) was \nunavailable. Ibid. \nThe court reasoned that \u201c[i]f Congress meant for the \nFirst Step Act\u2019s retroactivity bar to apply only to valid \nsentences, it could easily have said so.\u201d Pet. App. 8a. And \nit rejected Hewitt\u2019s arguments to the contrary, explaining \nthat \u201c[t]he mere observation that the statutory language \ncould be made clearer does not make it unclear in the first \nplace.\u201d Id. at 9a (quoting United States v. Jackson, 995 \nF.3d 522, 526 (6th Cir. 2021)). \nThe Fifth Circuit held further that \u201cvacatur has no \neffect\u201d on the outcome of the case. Pet. App. 9a. That \nconclusion was justified, the court explained, because \n\u201cotherwise, one who, as here, has been in prison for over \na decade serving later-vacated sentences would nonethe-\nless qualify\u201d for a more lenient sentence at resentencing \nunder the FSA. Pet. App. 9a-10a. The court referred to 18 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 3742(g), which requires use of the guidelines \n\u201cthat were in effect on the date of the previous sentencing \n\n12 \n \nof the defendant prior to the appeal\u201d for resentencing, \nwhich it characterized as giving continuing effect to \ninitial sentences that have been vacated. Id. at 10a. On \nthose grounds, the court affirmed. \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nPursuant to section 403(b) of the FSA, section 403(a) \napplies to a defendant who committed an offense and was \nconvicted and sentenced pre-enactment, but whose initial \nconviction and sentence have been vacated, necessitating \na post-enactment de novo resentencing.  \nA.1. The question here is whether Congress meant \u201ca \nsentence for the offense\u201d to include a sentence that was \npronounced before that date but later vacated. It could not \nhave done so. Congress drafts and enacts statutes against \nbackground legal principles, the content of which is \npresumptively incorporated into the meaning of the words \nit uses. As relevant here, the law treats a sentence that has \nbeen vacated as a nullity ab initio, as if it never existed. \nCases from before the Founding and consistently through \ntoday confirm that when an order or judgment is vacated, \nthe status quo ante is restored, and it is as though the order \nor judgment had never been made.  \nCongress is presumed to have known that settled \nlegal principle and, absent a contrary indication, to have \nincorporated it in the FSA. A sentence that has been \nvacated therefore cannot be \u201ca sentence for the offense,\u201d \nbecause a sentence that has been vacated does not exist. \nIt therefore cannot be ground to deny substantive relief at \nresentencing. \n2. Some lower courts have reasoned that to focus on \nthe invalidation ab initio of a vacated judgment is to add \nwords to section 403(b), effectively inserting the word \n\u201cvalid\u201d in front of the word \u201csentence.\u201d That reading has \nmatters backward. Again, the Court must presume that \nCongress incorporates settled legal principles into the \n\n13 \n \nstatutes it enacts. It therefore does not add words to the \nstatute to presume the word \u201csentence\u201d means a sentence \nthat has not been vacated. On the contrary, to read \u201ca \nsentence\u201d in section 403(b) to include a vacated sentence \nwould be to read it as \u201can initial sentence\u201d or \u201can original \nsentence.\u201d Such modifiers would be necessary to displace \nthe background rule that the law treats a sentence that \nhas been vacated as though it never existed. But Congress \ndid not include those words. \n3. Other courts have held that section 403(b) refers \nonly to the historical fact of a past pronouncement and \nthat a vacatur does not change the past. That is wrong \ntwice over. First, vacatur does change the past by opera-\ntion of law\u2014cases from time immemorial stand for the \nproposition that when an order is vacated, it as though the \nproceeding that produced the order never happened. That \nis why the Double Jeopardy Clause does not bar retrial \nafter a conviction is vacated on appeal. \nSecond, section 403(b) refers to the ongoing enforce-\nment of a sentence, not the fact of a past pronouncement. \nCongress\u2019s use of the present-perfect tense and the \npreposition \u201cas of\u201d confirm so. Use of the present-perfect \ntense implies concern with a time-span beginning in the \npast and extending up to now. And the preposition \u201cas of\u201d \nis used to indicate a time or date from which something \ncontinues. Together, they indicate that Congress was \nconcerned only with sentences that were pronounced pre-\nenactment and remain in force and effect today.  \nCommon English usage confirms the point. No one \nwould say that Hewitt\u2019s initial, since-vacated sentence \n\u201chas been imposed as of December 21, 2018,\u201d because it \nhas no continuing force or effect. If one wanted to refer to \nthe fact of a vacated sentence having been pronounced, \none would use the simple past tense and a preposition \nindicating a singular point in time: Hewitt\u2019s initial, since-\nvacated sentence was imposed before December 21, 2018. \n\n14 \n \nIndeed, Congress used just that formulation in section \n404, concerning sentencing modifications. That it did so \nthere but not in section 403(b) must be taken as inten-\ntional.  \n4. Statutory interpretation turns on ordinary, con-\ntemporary, and common use of the English language. \nThus, while rules of grammar and dictionary definitions \nare centrally important, the outcome cannot be \ndetermined by a single phrase scrutinized in the abstract. \nThe Court must look to the relevant language in its full \ncontext, with an eye to the statute\u2019s overall objective. \nOnly our interpretation is consistent with the FSA\u2019s \nbroader context, design, and purpose. Section 403(b) \nreflects a clear purpose: to make section 403(a)\u2019s amelior-\native sentencing reform available retroactively in pending \ncases while preserving the finality of valid criminal \njudgments. That line is sensible. Allowing application in \npending cases ensures that no court ever again engages in \nsentencing stacking, while at the same time respecting \nthe importance of the principle of finality to criminal \njustice and sound judicial administration. \nPlenary resentencings following full vacaturs are \n\u201cpending\u201d cases like any other; there is no sentence for \nthe defendant to serve, and a new one must be imposed by \nexercise of de novo judicial discretion. In that context, \napplication of section 403(a) would do nothing to disturb \nthe finality of an already-vacated judgment. Applying \nsection 403(a) to such cases is thus consistent with \nCongress\u2019s objective to foreclose stacking in pending \ncases while preserving the finality of past cases. \nThe opposite is true of the decision below. It draws an \narbitrary line between plenary sentencings and plenary \nresentencings, without any account for why Congress \nwould have intended such an irrational distinction. And \nin doing so, it ensures that prosecutors still may seek, and \n\n15 \n \ncourts still will be required to impose, stacked sentences \nin plenary sentencing proceedings into the future. That \ncannot be what Congress intended. \nB. The rule of lenity arises only if the Court concludes \nthat the statutory text is ambiguous, which the provision \nhere is not. But if the Court disagrees, it must resolve the \nambiguity in favor of Hewitt and the lesser sentence \nrequired under section 403(a). \nThe Court has repeatedly confirmed that the rule of \nlenity applies not only to statutes that define criminal \nliability, but also those that set the penalties for \nviolations. Under our interpretation of section 403(a), \nHewitt would face a mandatory minimum of 25 years. \nUnder the Fifth, Sixth, and Eleventh Circuit\u2019s mistaken \nconstruction, he would face a mandatory minimum of \nlonger than one century at his resentencing on the section \n924(c) counts alone. If there is any reasonable doubt \nabout the construction of section 403(a), it must be \nresolved in his favor. \nARGUMENT \n\u201cThe controlling principle in this case is the basic and \nunexceptional rule that courts must give effect to the \nclear meaning of statutes as written.\u201d Star Athletica, LLC \nv. Varsity Brands, Inc., 580 U.S. 405, 414 (2017) \n(quoting Estate of Coward v. Nicklos Drilling Co., 505 \nU.S. 469, 476 (1992)). When the statute\u2019s text is \u201cunam-\nbiguous,\u201d that \u201cfirst step of the interpretive inquiry\u201d is \nalso the \u201clast.\u201d Rotkiske v. Klemm, 589 U.S. 8, 13 (2019). \nTo interpret Congress\u2019s words, the Court must focus \non \u201cordinary, contemporary, [and] common\u201d use of the \nEnglish language. Star Athletica, 580 U.S. at 414. That \nmeans among other things the Court must give the text a \nreading that is consistent with and incorporates settled \nbackground legal principles, with which the public would \nexpect any words to comport. E.g., Cannon v. University \n\n16 \n \nof Chicago, 441 U.S. 677, 696-697 (1979) (explaining \nthat \u201c[i]t is always appropriate to assume that our elected \nrepresentatives, like other citizens, know the law\u201d). \nAnd while background principles, rules of grammar, \nand dictionary definitions are centrally important to the \ntask of statutory interpretation, the Court must \u201c\u2018con-\nsider not only the bare meaning\u2019 of the critical word or \nphrase \u2018but also its placement and purpose in the statu-\ntory scheme.\u2019\u201d Holloway v. United States, 526 U.S. 1, 6 \n(1999) (quoting Bailey v. United States, 516 U.S. 137, 145 \n(1995)). The only permissible meaning of a word or \nphrase is the one that fits with the statutory context and \npurpose, rather than conflicts with them. See, e.g., Dubin \nv. United States, 599 U.S. 110, 118-120 (2023). \nFirst, Congress did not intend the phrase \u201ca sentence \nfor the offense\u201d to include a vacated sentence. According \nto settled background principles, the law treats a vacated \nsentence as never having been pronounced. For a statute \nto override that principle requires a clear statement. \nThere is no such statement here.  \nSecond, the contrary rationales offered among the \nlower courts are unpersuasive. The rules of grammar, \nrelevant dictionary definitions, and statutory context all \nconfirm that Congress intended section 403(b) to \nauthorize section 403(a) relief in all pending cases, \nincluding cases that are pending de novo resentencing \nfollowing a vacatur. No other conclusion is consistent \nwith Congress\u2019s purpose or settled practice. And even if \nthere were doubt on that front (there should be none), it \nwould be resolved by the rule of lenity.  \nNo matter whether the Court finds the words clear or \nambiguous, a resentencing with the benefit of section \n403(a) is necessary. \n\n17 \n \nA. Section 403(a) applies to post-enactment \nde novo resentencings \nAll relevant considerations\u2014the text, context, and \npurpose of the FSA, the statute\u2019s design, and the back-\nground principles against which it was enacted\u2014confirm \nthat section 403(a) applies to plenary resentencings that \ntake place after the Act\u2019s enactment. \n1. A sentence that has been vacated is not \u201ca \nsentence for the offense\u201d \nThe central issue is whether Congress meant \u201ca \nsentence for the offense\u201d imposed \u201cas of\u201d December 21, \n2018, to include a sentence that was pronounced before \nthat date but later vacated. It did not. \na. One rule for reading \u201cstatutory text is recognizing \nthat Congress legislates against the backdrop of certain \nunexpressed presumptions.\u201d Bond v. United States, 572 \nU.S. 844, 857 (2014). Among those presumptions is that \n\u201cCongress is aware of existing law\u201d and, absent express \nindication otherwise, intends for the statutes it enacts to \ncomport with settled background legal principles and \nprecedents. See, e.g., Mississippi ex rel. Hood v. AU \nOptronics Corp., 571 U.S. 161, 169 (2014); accord \nCannon, 441 U.S. at 696-697. \nPut another way, the background principles against \nwhich Congress acts operate as default rules to which it \npresumptively intends for its enactments to conform. \nBecause the accepted legal backdrop will generally accord \nwith \u201cwidely held intuitions about how statutes ordin-\narily operate,\u201d a presumption that Congress means to \nincorporate background legal principles \u201cwill generally \ncoincide with legislative and public expectations.\u201d \nLandgraf v. USI Film Productions, 511 U.S. 244, 272 \n(1994). Cf. US Airways, Inc. v. McCutchen, 569 U.S. 88, \n102 (2013) (in a case concerning ERISA plan documents, \nrelying on the \u201cdefault rules [that] govern in the absence \n\n18 \n \nof a clear expression of [a] contrary intent\u201d); Staub v. \nProctor Hospital, 562 U.S. 411, 418 (2011) (in a federal \ntort case, observing that the Court must \u201cconsult general \nprinciples of law\u201d that \u201cform the background against \nwhich federal tort laws are enacted\u201d). \nb. Here, the settled legal background against which \nsection 403(b) was adopted demonstrates beyond debate \nthat Congress did not mean for \u201ca sentence\u201d to include a \nvacated sentence. Absent contrary intent, a vacated order \nis and always has been treated as though it was never \nentered in the first place\u2014it is a nullity, as though it never \nexisted. See United States v. Mitchell, 38 F.4th 382, 392 \n(3d Cir. 2022) (Bibas, J., concurring) (historical prin-\nciples \u201creveal that vacatur makes a sentence void from \nthe start\u201d). Nothing in section 403(b)\u2019s text overrides \nthat default understanding. \nTake first historical sources. At common law before \nthe Founding, vacatur on appeal made it \u201cas if no \n[judgment] had been\u201d entered, meaning in effect that \nthere was no \u201crecord of it.\u201d Ognell\u2019s Case (1592) 78 Eng. \nRep. 526, 526; 34 Cro. Eliz. 270, 271 (Q.B.); accord Eyre \nv. Woodfine (1592) 78 Eng. Rep. 533, 533; 34 Cro. Eliz. \n278, 278-279 (Q.B.). Countless other historical sources \nconfirm that when an order is vacated, it is \u201cin all respects \nas though the [order] had never been made.\u201d Norman v. \nNorman, 207 P. 970, 972 (Okla. 1922). Since time out of \nmind, courts have understood that vacatur \u201cputs the \nparties in the state, in which they were, immediately \nbefore the judgment was rendered,\u201d fully restoring the \nstatus quo ante. Lockwood v. Jones, 7 Conn. 431, 436 \n(1829). This Court summarized this principle more than \n150 years ago: \u201cvacating the former judgment * * * \nrender[s] it null and void, and the parties are left in the \nsame situation as if no trial had ever taken place in the \ncause.\u201d United States v. Ayres, 76 U.S. (9 Wall.) 608, 610 \n(1869).  \n\n19 \n \nA vacated order is not merely \u201csuspended\u201d on a \nforward-looking basis, while \u201cretain[ing] its vitality\u201d \nretrospectively. Stewart v. Oneal, 237 F. 897, 906 (6th \nCir. 1916). Rather, \u201cwhere an irregular order has been \nvacated it is held to be the same as though it never existed, \nand for that reason\u201d courts may not afford any \u201cprotec-\ntion to the acts which may have been performed under it.\u201d \nFarnsworth v. Western Union Telephone Co., 6 N.Y.S. \n735, 747 (Gen. Term 1889) (emphasis added). When \norders are vacated, it is \u201cas though they had never been \nmade or had\u201d in the first place. United States v. Mayse, 5 \nF.2d 885, 886 (9th Cir. 1925).2 \nThis ancient principle has been carried forward to \nmodern times without meaningful alteration. Like their \nforebears, cases since the midcentury onward confirm \nthat after a conviction is vacated, the defendant \u201cstand[s] \n \n2  Other historical examples expressing this principle are too many to \nlist. For a limited sample, see Williams v. Floyd, 27 N.C. 649, 656 \n(1845) (a void or \u201cstricken\u201d order is \u201cthe same as if the [order] had \nnever been made\u201d); Lawson v. Bissell, 7 Ohio St. 129, 132 (1857) \n(when a verdict and judgment are \u201cvacated\u201d it is \u201cas if there had been \nno trial\u201d); In re Lacey, 14 F. Cas. 906, 908 (C.C.D. Conn. 1874) \n(vacating an order allows the parties to act \u201cin the same way and \nmanner, and to the like effect\u201d as they could have had the order \n\u201cnever been made\u201d); Strickland v. Flagstaff Silver Mining Co., 1 Utah \n199, 204 (1875) (for purposes of post-judgment motions, a judgment \nthat is vacated \u201cwas as though it had never existed\u201d); Aultman v. \nSeiberling, 31 Ohio St. 201, 204 (1877) (when a decision is vacated, \nthe law and the facts are treated \u201cthe same as if no decision had been \nmade\u201d); Bondholders & Purchasers of the Iron Railroad v. Toledo, 62 \nF. 166, 168 (7th Cir. 1894) (after a court order vacating and annulling \na decree disallowing a claim, the claim was \u201cre-established in all \nrespects as fully as if [the vacated decree] had never been made\u201d); \nGreen v. McCarter, 42 S.E. 157, 158 (S.C. 1902) (when a judge \n\u201crevoke[s] his * * * order, the case [stands] just as if no order had been \nmade\u201d); In re Rochester Sanitarium & Baths Co., 222 F. 22, 26 (2d \nCir. 1915) (recognizing \u201c[t]he general rule\u201d that when a court vacates \nan order, \u201cit is the same as if such order had never existed\u201d). \n\n20 \n \nin the position of any man who was accused of a crime but \nhas not yet shown to have committed it.\u201d Fiswick v. \nUnited States, 329 U.S. 211, 223 (1946). \u201cThe general \nrule,\u201d according to these cases, \u201cis that when an order or \njudgment is vacated the previously existing status is \nrestored and the situation is the same as though the order \nor judgment had never been made.\u201d Wrang v. Spencer, \n235 A.2d 861, 863 (Conn. App. Ct. 1967). Nearly \nverbatim restatements of this universal principle appear \nin Mitchell v. Joseph, 117 F.2d 253, 255 (7th Cir. 1941); \nMiller v. Schlereth, 36 N.W.2d 497, 506 (Neb. 1949); \nTims v. Holland Furnace Co., 90 N.E.2d 376, 380 (Ohio \n1950); and Buchanan v. Cabiness, 245 S.W.2d 868, 873 \n(Mo. 1951) (en banc). \nThe notion that a vacated order is treated as though it \nhad never been entered in the first place reflects the same \nprinciple behind the Court\u2019s own Munsingwear doctrine: \nAn order vacating a judgment \u201celiminates [the] judg-\nment\u201d so that \u201cnone is prejudiced\u201d by it, \u201cclear[ing] the \npath for future relitigation of the issues between the \nparties.\u201d United States v. Munsingwear, 340 U.S. 36, 40 \n(1950). \u201cThe point of vacatur is to prevent\u201d its object \n\u201cfrom spawning any legal consequences, so that no party \nis harmed by\u201d it. Camreta v. Greene, 563 U.S. 692, 713 \n(2011) (citing Munsingwear). \nAnd the law not only treats the vacated judgment as \na nullity in its own right, but also regards the proceedings \nproducing it effectively as never having happened. Thus, \nfor example, the vacatur of a criminal judgment of convic-\ntion on appeal effectively erases from history the fact of \nthe jury\u2019s empanelment in the original trial, and thus in \nmost circumstances \u201cthere is no double jeopardy upon a \nnew trial.\u201d Burks v. United States, 437 U.S. 1, 12 (1978) \n(quoting Bryan v. United States, 338 U.S. 552, 560 \n(1950)). That rule \u201crests ultimately upon the premise that \nthe original conviction has, at the defendant\u2019s behest, \n\n21 \n \nbeen wholly nullified and the slate wiped clean.\u201d North \nCarolina v. Pearce, 395 U.S. 711, 721 (1969) (citing \nUnited States v. Ball, 163 U.S. 662 (1896)). \nThe same rationale applies with respect to senten-\ncing. As the Court made clear in Pepper v. United States, \n562 U.S. 476 (2011), when a court of appeals \u201cset[s] \naside [a defendant\u2019s] entire sentence and remand[s] for a \nde novo resentencing,\u201d all legal effect from the original \nsentencing proceeding is nullified, \u201ceffectively wip[ing] \nthe slate clean.\u201d Id. at 507. Rulings made at the original \nsentencing therefore have no continuing vitality under \nthe law-of-the-case doctrine. Ibid. \nc. The legal backdrop against which Congress en-\nacted the FSA is thus clear: When a criminal sentence is \nvacated, the status quo ante is restored as if the sentence \nhad never been pronounced. A sentence that has been \nvacated is a nullity; it is nothing; it never existed. See \nFiswick, 329 U.S. at 223.  \nThat resolves this case. Congress specified that \nsection 403(a)\u2019s sentencing reform shall apply \u201cif a \nsentence for the offense has not been imposed as of\u201d \nDecember 21, 2018. FSA \u00a7 403(b) (emphasis added). \nBecause a sentence that has been vacated is treated by \noperation of law as though it never was imposed\u2014so that \nit \u201cspawn[s no] legal consequences\u201d and \u201cno party is \nharmed by\u201d it (Camreta, 563 U.S. at 713 (quoting \nMunsingwear, 340 U.S. at 40-41))\u2014Congress could not \nhave intended for \u201ca sentence\u201d to include a vacated \nsentence. As a matter of law, an offender whose sentence \nhas been vacated is one for whom \u201ca sentence for the \noffense has not been imposed\u201d ever, including as of \nDecember 21, 2018.  \n\n22 \n \n2. Contrary opinions among the lower courts \nare not persuasive \na. In holding otherwise, the Fifth Circuit focused on \nthe indefinite article, \u201ca\u201d appearing before the word \n\u201csentence.\u201d See Pet. App. 8a-9a. The same argument was \nspelled out by then-Judge Barrett in her dissent in United \nStates v. Uriarte, 975 F.3d 596 (7th Cir. 2020) (en banc): \n\u201c[T]he indefinite article \u2018a\u2019 is broad enough,\u201d she argued, \n\u201cto refer to any sentence that has been imposed for the \noffense, even one that was subsequently vacated.\u201d Id. at \n608. In her and the Fifth Circuit\u2019s view, a pre-enactment \nsentence, even if later vacated, remains \u201ca sentence\u201d \nimposed \u201cas of\u201d December 21, 2018. Ibid.; Pet. App. 8a-\n9a; see also United States v. Hernandez, 107 F.4th 965, \n969 (11th Cir. 2024). \nRespectfully, that position disregards the nature of a \nvacatur and the default rule that it establishes. When \nCongress says \u201ca sentence\u201d without more, it cannot mean \na sentence that is treated by operation of law as never \nhaving been imposed. Otherwise, what would it mean for \nsomething to be treated as never having been imposed? \nThat conclusion does not add words to the statute, as \nthe Fifth Circuit implied. In the lower court\u2019s view, \u201c[i]f \nCongress meant for the First Step Act\u2019s retroactivity bar \nto apply only to valid sentences, it could easily have said \nso\u201d by specifying \u201ca valid sentence.\u201d Pet. App. 8a-9a. But \nthat misses the point, which is that an adjective like \n\u201cvalid\u201d would have been redundant given the background \nlegal principles against which Congress adopted the FSA. \nAgain, Congress is presumed to be aware of and \nincorporate those principles in the statues it enacts. And \nhere, the long-settled rule is that when an unlawful \u201corder \nhas been vacated it is held to be the same as though it \nnever existed\u201d and the law will \u201cafford no protection to \n\n23 \n \nthe acts which may have been performed under it.\u201d \nFarnsworth, 6 N.Y.S. at 747.  \nAccordingly, it is the Fifth Circuit\u2019s reading, not \npetitioner\u2019s, that would add words to the statute. To read \n\u201ca sentence\u201d as including a vacated sentence would be to \nread the statute as saying \u201can initial sentence\u201d or \u201can \noriginal sentence.\u201d Use of such adjectives would have \nreadily displaced the default rule that a vacated sentence \nis treated as a matter of law as never having existed. But \nCongress did not use those modifiers, and thus the \nassumption \u201cthat our elected representatives, like other \ncitizens, know the law\u201d when they draft and enact \nstatutes (Cannon, 441 U.S. at 696-697) carries the day \nfor Hewitt. \nb. Some lower courts have instead simply denied the \npremise of the argument, asserting that an order fully \nvacating a sentence \u201cdoes not require the district court to \nproceed as if the initial sentencing never happened.\u201d Pet. \nApp. 9a (quoting Uriarte, 975 F.3d at 608 (Barrett, J., \ndissenting)). For support, they have pointed to 18 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 3742(g)(1), which specifies that \u201ca district court \nimposing a sentence on remand\u201d following a vacatur on \nappeal \u201cmust apply the Sentencing Guidelines \u2018that were \nin effect on the date of the previous sentencing of the defen-\ndant prior to the appeal.\u2019\u201d Uriarte, 975 F.3d at 608 \n(Barrett, J., dissenting) (quoting section 3742(g)(1)). \nThat, we are told, is evidence that the effects of a vacated \nsentence are not wholly eliminated, and a court need not \n\u201cproceed as if the earlier sentencing never happened.\u201d \nUnited States v. Carpenter, 80 F.4th 790, 792 (6th Cir. \n2023) (Kethledge, J., concurring in the denial of rehear-\ning en banc). \nThat misunderstands what section 3742(g)(1) does. \nAs a starting point, the very relevance of the provision is \ndoubtful. It provides only that when a court of appeals \nremands a case for resentencing (plenary or otherwise), \n\n24 \n \nthe district court must utilize the sentencing guidelines \n\u201cthat were in effect on the date of the previous sen-\ntencing.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(g)(1). That shows only that \nCongress did not want changes to the guidelines to apply \nretroactively at resentencing. The statute\u2019s reference to \nthe state of the law on \u201cthe date of\u201d a prior proceeding \ndoes not suggest in any way that a vacated sentence itself \ncontinues to have legal force or effect.  \nMoreover, to the extent section 3742(g) has any rele-\nvance, it is only to confirm that Congress knows how to \nuse express language to override the default rule when it \nwishes to. Our point is not that a vacated sentence can \nnever have ongoing consequences\u2014it is only that, given \nthat Congress is assumed to understand that a vacated \nsentence is treated as if it were never entered, Congress \nwould have to use express language to accomplish that \nobjective. That is at most what section 3742(g) confirms: \nWhen Congress wants a vacated sentence to continue to \nhave some effect, it says so using a clear statement. Such \nlanguage is missing from section 403(b). \n3. Section 403(b) refers to the ongoing enforce-\nment of a sentence, not the fact of a past pro-\nnouncement \na. Other lower court opinions have rejected the rele-\nvance of vacatur by characterizing the imposition of a \nsentence as a historical fact that, if it occurred, cannot be \nerased from the documented past by a later vacatur of the \nsentence. According to this rationale, when Congress said \nthat section 403(a) shall apply to a pre-enactment offense \n\u201cif a sentence for the offense has not been imposed as of\u201d \nDecember 21, 2018 (FSA \u00a7 403(b)), it actually meant \u201cif \na sentence was not pronounced before\u201d that date.  \nThe Eleventh Circuit took this view in Hernandez. \nThere, it reasoned that section 403(b) \u201cis best read to \nrefer to a completed act\u201d because it conjugates the verb \n\n25 \n \n\u201cimposed,\u201d which \u201crefers to the historical fact of pro-\nnouncement\u201d taking place at \u201ca specific point in time.\u201d \nHernandez, 107 F.4th at 969-970; accord Pet. App. 7a-\n8a. Viewing the imposition of a sentence this way renders \neffect of vacatur irrelevant, according to these sources, \nbecause \u201cvacatur does not erase * * * from history\u201d the \nrecorded fact that a sentence was pronounced on a date \npreceding enactment. United States v. Jackson, 995 F.3d \n522, 525 (6th Cir. 2021). \nb. The problem with that approach is two-fold.  \nFirst, that is indeed precisely what an order of vacatur \ndoes\u2014by operation of law, it erases from history both the \nvacated order or judgment and the proceeding that \nproduced it. Thus, when a verdict and judgment are \n\u201cvacate[d],\u201d it is \u201cas if no trial had ever taken place in the \ncause.\u201d Ayres, 76 U.S. (9 Wall.) at 610; accord Lawson, \n7 Ohio St. at 132 (following a vacatur, the case must \nproceed \u201cas if there had been no trial\u201d).  \nAgain, that is the premise underlying the rule that \n\u201cthere is no double jeopardy upon a new trial\u201d following \na vacatur on appeal of the final judgment. Burks, 437 U.S. \nat 12. \u201cThere are few if any rules of criminal procedure \nclearer than the rule that \u2018jeopardy attaches when the jury \nis empaneled and sworn.\u2019\u201d Martinez v. Illinois, 572 U.S. \n833, 839 (2014) (quoting Crist v. Bretz, 437 U.S. 28, 35 \n(1978)). But when a conviction is later vacated, the law \ntreats the jury\u2019s empanelment at the first trial effectively \nas if it had never happened. Burks, 437 U.S. at 12.  \nApplied here, that means that no legal disability may \nfollow from Hewitt\u2019s sentence ever having existed, \nincluding any disability following from the historical fact \nof the pronouncement having taken place. \nSecond, the historical-fact approach to section 403(b) \nis inconsistent with the verb tense and preposition that \nCongress used there. If Congress had meant the applic-\n\n26 \n \nability of section 403(a) to turn on whether a district \njudge had pronounced a sentence on a date preceding \nDecember 21, 2018, as a simple matter of historical fact, \nit would not have used the present-perfect tense or the \npreposition \u201cas of.\u201d Instead, it would have used the \nsimple past tense, together with a preposition such as \nbefore or prior to\u2014it would have said section 403(a) shall \napply to a pre-enactment offense \u201cif a sentence for the \noffense was imposed before such date of enactment.\u201d That \nword choice would have been consistent with the House \nLegislative Drafting Manual, which directs drafters of \nlegislation to use the past tense to refer to \u201cfacts that \nmust precede\u201d the statute\u2019s \u201coperation.\u201d House Legisla-\ntive Counsel\u2019s Manual on Drafting Style, HLC No. 104-1, \n\u00a7 351(f)(2), at 60 (1995). \nBut that is not the formulation that Congress chose. \nInstead, it used the present-perfect tense, together with \nthe preposition \u201cas of.\u201d Each alone\u2014and undeniably both \ntogether\u2014connote an ongoing condition rather than the \noccurrence of a singular past event.  \nThe relevant grammar rules make this clear. The \npresent-perfect tense uses the words \u201chas been\u201d (or in \nthis case \u201chas not been\u201d). Whereas the past tense \u201cis a \nsimple tense, just past,\u201d the present perfect \u201cis a com-\npound tense combining past and present.\u201d Rodney Hud-\ndleston & Geoffrey K. Pullum, The Cambridge Grammar \nof the English Language 142 (2002) (hereinafter \nCambridge Grammar). That is to say, the present perfect \n\u201cinvolves reference to both past and present time\u201d and \n\u201cis concerned with a time-span beginning in the past and \nextending up to now.\u201d Id. at 143 (emphasis added). Thus, \nin contrast with the past tense, which focuses on a \nsingular past occurrence, \u201cthe primary focus\u201d of the \npresent-perfect \u201cis on the present.\u201d Ibid. It accordingly \n\u201cis not used in contexts where the \u2018now\u2019 component of \n[the time span] is explicitly or implicitly excluded,\u201d such \n\n27 \n \nas when one is speaking about a discrete past event that \nhas concluded. Ibid. \nThat alone forecloses Hernandez\u2019s past-historical-\nfact rationale. If one says that a sentence \u201chas been im-\nposed as of\u201d some past date, it indicates that the sentence \nwas in effect on that date and is still being enforced today, \n\u201cextending up to now.\u201d Cambridge Grammar 143. It \nindicates, in other words, that the sentence remains final \nand in force at the time of speaking, and that it has not \nbeen vacated by a court. 3 \nThat conclusion follows not only from the use of the \npresent-perfect tense, but also from the preposition \u201cas \nof,\u201d which indicates a time or date \u201cfrom\u201d which some-\nthing begins or continues. See Collins English Dictionary \n113 (14th ed. 2023) (hereinafter Collins). One would say, \nfor example, that a contract is effective \u201cas of\u201d the date it \ncomes into force. In doing so, one would indicate the \ncommencement of a continuous period of enforcement\u2014\nthe effective date and onward. And if one were to combine \n\u201cas of\u201d with the present-perfect tense (stating that a \ncontract \u201chas been effective as of December 21, 2018\u201d), \nthe plain meaning would be that the contract was en-\nforceable on that date and remains so now. In contrast, it \nwould be incoherent to say that a contract \u201chas been \neffective as of December 21, 2018,\u201d if, at the time of \nspeaking, the contract was terminated by the parties or \nvoided by a court.3 \n \n3  It bears noting \u201cthe widely accepted modern legislative drafting \nconvention that a law should not be read to speak as of the date of \nenactment,\u201d but \u201c\u2018as of any date on which it is read.\u2019\u201d Carr v. United \nStates, 560 U.S. 438, 463 (2010) (Alito, J., dissenting) (quoting \nSenate Office of the Legislative Counsel, Legislative Drafting \nManual \u00a7 103(a), at 4 (1997)). This convention recognizes that most \nlaws \u201chave a continuing effect in that they apply over time,\u201d and they \nthus \u201cspeak at the time of reading, not merely at the time of their \nadoption.\u201d Id. at 464.  \n\n28 \n \nThe same goes for section 403(b). Congress specified \nthat section 403(a) shall apply to a pre-enactment offense \n\u201cif a sentence for the offense has not been imposed as of\u201d \nDecember 21, 2018. The inverse is that section 403(a) \nshall not apply to a pre-enactment offense \u201cif a sentence \nfor the offense has been imposed as of\u201d that date. But it \nwould be ungrammatical to say that Hewitt is a defendant \non whom \u201ca sentence has been imposed as of\u201d December \n21, 2018, because that formulation mistakenly implies \nthat at the time of speaking, there is a present, ongoing \nenforcement of his sentence. \nOne might say that Hewitt\u2019s initial sentence was \nimposed before that date. But, again, those are not the \nwords Congress used. And \u201ccourts must presume that a \nlegislature says in a statute what it means and means in a \nstatute what it says there.\u201d Connecticut National Bank v. \nGermain, 503 U.S. 249, 253-254 (1992). \nc. Use of the word \u201cimposed\u201d does not change mat-\nters. To be sure, \u201cimposed,\u201d viewed in isolation, can be \ntaken to mean \u201cto establish as something to be obeyed or \ncomplied with.\u201d Collins 984; see also Webster\u2019s Third \nNew International Dictionary 1136 (2002) (hereinafter \nWebster\u2019s) (defining impose as, among other things, \n\u201cbestow\u201d). On that meaning, a judge who imposes a \nsentence establishes it or bestows it on the defendant as a \nmatter of fact at a singular point in time.  \nBut the word can also mean to \u201cenforce\u201d (Collins \n984) or to \u201capply,\u201d as in a \u201cpenalty\u201d (Webster\u2019s 1136). \nUnderstood in that way, the word means an ongoing \ncondition of enforcement: A sentence is imposed on (it is \napplied to or enforced against) an offender during the \nentire duration of his or her incarceration. This meaning \nsuggests not a singular past occurrence that took place at \na particular point in time, but rather an ongoing condition: \nA \u201csentence remains \u2018imposed\u2019\u201d until it is \u201cvacate[d].\u201d \n\n29 \n \nUnited States v. Henry, 983 F.3d 214, 223 (6th Cir. \n2020). \nThe academic possibility of these two meanings does \nnot render section 403(b) ambiguous. The proper interp-\nretation of \u201cwords that can have more than one meaning\u201d \nare generally resolved \u201cby their surroundings.\u201d Arizona \nv. Inter Tribal Council of Arizona, 570 U.S. 1, 10 (2013) \n(quoting Whitman v. American Trucking Associations, \n531 U.S. 457, 466 (2001)). That is, the \u201csusceptibility\u201d \nof a singular word to multiple meanings does not neces-\nsarily render the word ambiguous, because \u201call but one of \nthe meanings is ordinarily eliminated by context.\u201d Deal v. \nUnited States, 508 U.S. 129, 131-132 (1993). \nJust so here. By using the present-perfect tense \n(rather than the past tense) and the preposition \u201cas of\u201d \n(rather than \u201cbefore\u201d or \u201cprior to\u201d) Congress signaled its \nfocus on a \u201ctime-span beginning in the past and extending \nup to now.\u201d Cambridge Grammar 143. Any contention \nthat the word \u201cimposed\u201d in section 403(b) \u201crefers to the \nhistorical fact of pronouncement\u201d at \u201ca specific point in \ntime\u201d (Hernandez, 107 F.4th at 970) rather than a \ncondition of ongoing enforcement would require reform-\ning the tense and replacing the preposition that Congress \nused. The law permits no such revisions. \nd. Moreover, section 404 of the FSA demonstrates \nthat Congress was aware of and intended the difference. \nThere, Congress provided for motions to reduce valid, \nfinal sentences in limited circumstances. See generally \nConcepcion v. United States, 597 U.S. 481 (2022). In \ndoing so, Congress limited relief in two notable ways. \nFirst, it specified in section 404(c) that \u201c[n]o court shall \nentertain a motion made under this section to reduce a \nsentence if the sentence was previously imposed or \npreviously reduced\u201d under certain circumstances. FSA \n\u00a7 404(c), Pet. App. 21a. If the lower court were correct \nthat Congress intended in section 403(b) to refer to a \n\n30 \n \nsingular past event (the pronouncement of a sentence \nbefore enactment), it presumably would have used the \nsame formulation\u2014section 403(a) shall apply to pre-\nenactment offenses \u201cif no sentence for the offense was \npreviously imposed.\u201d It did not do so. \n Second, also in section 404(c), Congress foreclosed \nrelief if a motion \u201cto reduce the sentence was, after the \ndate of enactment of this Act, denied after a complete \nreview of the motion on the merits.\u201d Again, if the lower \ncourt\u2019s reading were correct, Congress could have used \nthat alternative formulation in section 403(b)\u2014section \n403(a) shall apply to pre-enactment offenses \u201cif no \nsentence for the offense was imposed before said date of \nenactment.\u201d Again, it did not do so. \nBoth examples demonstrate that Congress knows \nhow to use the simple past tense to denote discrete events \ntaking place at fixed times in the past when it wishes to. \nIt did so in section 404(c), but it did not do so in section \n403(b). And the Court \u201cgenerally presum[es] that Con-\ngress acts intentionally and purposely when it includes \nparticular language in one section of a statute but omits it \nin another.\u201d Intel Corp. Investment Policy Committee v. \nSulyma, 589 U.S. 178, 186 (2020) (quoting BFP v. Res-\nolution Trust Corporation, 511 U.S. 531, 537 (1994)).  \nAll of this leads to a straightforward conclusion: \nWhen Congress said that section 403(a) shall apply to a \npre-enactment offense \u201cif a sentence for the offense has \nnot been imposed as of\u201d December 21, 2018 (FSA \n\u00a7 403(b), Pet. App. 20a), it meant a sentence that was \nbeing enforced \u201cas of\u201d that date and is still being enforced \nat the relevant time of reading. And needless to say, that \ndoes not describe a sentence vacated before the reading.  \n\n31 \n \n4. Purpose and practice confirm that section \n403(a) applies to plenary resentencings \na. Purpose and practice confirm the Fifth Circuit\u2019s \nerror in this case. Statutory interpretation turns on the \nway that ordinary English speakers use language. The \nCourt thus has a long history of reading statutory words \nand phrases \u201cnot in a vacuum, but with reference to the \nstatutory context, \u2018structure, history, and purpose,\u2019\u201d \n\u201cnot to mention common sense.\u201d Abramski v. United \nStates, 573 U.S. 169, 179 (2014) (quoting Maracich v. \nSpears, 570 U.S. 48, 76 (2013)). While rules of grammar, \ndictionary definitions, and background legal principles \nare of course matters of central importance, the Court \n\u201cmust not be guided by a single sentence or member of a \nsentence\u201d studied in the academic abstract; it must \ninstead \u201clook to the provisions of the whole law, and to \nits object and policy.\u201d Kelly v. Robinson, 479 U.S. 36, 43 \n(1986) (quoting Offshore Logistics, Inc. v. Tallentire, 477 \nU.S. 207, 221 (1986)).  \nAlthough broader in total effect, the FSA\u2019s \u201cmost \nimportant reforms\u201d were the \u201cchanges to mandatory \nminimums\u201d at issue here. 164 Cong. Rec. S7748 (daily \ned. Dec. 18, 2018) (statement of Sen. Klobuchar). Moved \nby heartless examples of excessive imprisonment, Con-\ngress set out to \u201celiminate[] the so-called stacking pro-\nvision in the U.S. Code\u201d and to \u201censure that sentencing \nenhancements for repeat offenses apply only to true \nrepeat offenders.\u201d Id. at S7774 (statement of Sen. \nCardin); accord 164 Cong. Rec. H10362 (daily ed. Dec. \n20, 2018) (statement of Rep. Nadler). Courts on both \nsides of the issue have thus concluded that the FSA\u2019s \npurpose \u201cis obvious: to reduce the harsh length of sen-\ntences for * * * certain firearms offenses.\u201d Mitchell, 38 \nF.4th at 387. It was, in other words, \u201cto ensure that the \nlengthy mandatory-minimum sentences for stacked \n\n32 \n \n\u00a7 924(c) convictions ended, whether at initial senten-\ncings or resentencings.\u201d Henry, 983 F.3d at 224.  \nTo that end, Congress made section 403(a) applicable \nnot only to post-enactment crimes, but also pre-enact-\nment ones. In doing so, it had two options: First, it could \nmake section 403(a) retroactively applicable to all \ndefendants serving stacked sentences, including those \nsubject to valid final judgments. Second, it could make \nsection 403(a) retroactively applicable to crimes com-\nmitted pre-enactment, but only in pending, non-final \ncases.  \nThe choice required a balance of competing values of \nthe highest order. On the one hand, Congress was deeply \nconcerned that defendants were serving unduly harsh and \noverlong sentences. Few government interventions have \nthe same impact and gravity as deprivation of liberty by \nimprisonment. On the other hand, there is a \u201cstrong \ninterest in preserving the finality of judgments.\u201d Harris \nv. Rivera, 454 U.S. 339, 348 n.21 (1981) (quoting Hen-\nderson v. Kibbe, 431 U.S. 145, 154 n.13 (1977)). \nLegislators understand that \u201c[f]inality is essential to both \nthe retributive and the deterrent functions of criminal \nlaw.\u201d Calderon v. Thompson, 523 U.S. 538, 555 (1998). \nAnd finality serves the public\u2019s interest in efficient \njudicial administration, increases confidence in the \njustice system, and fosters the public interest in repose. \nEvidently with these latter principles in mind, Con-\ngress selected the second option: It made section 403(a) \nrelief available to defendants whose criminal conduct \npredated enactment of the statute, but whose cases were \n\u201cpending\u201d (that is, those whose sentence \u201chas not been \n\n33 \n \nimposed as of\u201d the FSA\u2019s enactment). See FSA \u00a7 403(b) \n(titled \u201cApplicability to Pending Cases\u201d).4 \nIn taking this approach, \u201cCongress stanched, to the \ndegree that it could,\u201d the problem of sentence stacking, \nbut \u201cwithout overturning valid and settled sentences.\u201d \nUriarte, 975 F.3d at 601. \u201cIn choosing not to write \n\u00a7 403(b) to allow reductions to valid sentences that al-\nready had been imposed, Congress expressed a policy \npreference in favor of settled expectations and ease of \nadministration.\u201d Id. at 605; see also United States v. \nMerrell, 37 F.4th 571, 576 (9th Cir. 2022) (\u201c[W]e find it \nclear that \u00a7 403(b) was intended to ensure that the \nadoption of the First Step Act by itself would not affect \nany sentence previously imposed.\u201d); Henry, 983 F.3d at \n225 (\u201cCongress chose not to disrupt the finality of past \nsentences \n* * * \nfor \ndefendants \nserving \nstacked \nsentences.\u201d).  \nWhat is more, Congress \u201cnaturally wanted to reach \nall cases where there was not already a sentence in place.\u201d \nUriarte, 975 F.3d at 605. It intended to give defendants \nthe benefit of section 403(a) at all future plenary \nsentencing proceedings, without disturbing the sentences \nvalidly imposed in past proceedings. \nb. Applying section 403(a) to defendants like Hewitt \nis consistent with Congress\u2019s policy choice. The lower \ncourt\u2019s contrary decision is not. \nOnce a court vacates a criminal sentence and orders a \nde novo resentencing, there can no longer be any interest \n \n4  \u201cThis Court has long considered that the title of a statute and the \nheading of a section are tools available for the resolution of a doubt \nabout the meaning of\u201d a statutory provision. Dubin, 599 U.S. at 120-\n121 (cleaned up). A section title cannot \u201coverride\u201d the words that \nfollow, but Congress\u2019s words \u201cmust be construed in light of the terms \nsurrounding them, and the title Congress chose is among those \nterms.\u201d Id. at 121 (cleaned up).  \n\n34 \n \nin finality. See Pepper, 562 U.S. at 507. Because the \ndistrict court must resentence the defendant \u201cas if no \ninitial sentencing ever occurred\u201d (United States v. Burke, \n863 F.3d 1355, 1359 (11th Cir. 2017)), finality is already \nout the window by the time the district court undertakes \na de novo resentencing following a vacatur. The initial \nsentence is gone, and a brand new sentence must be deter-\nmined and pronounced. \nPractice bears this out. A plenary resentencing is a de \nnovo proceeding, and the district court must exercise its \ndiscretion anew in setting an appropriate sentence. \u201c[A]t \nany subsequent resentencing after a sentence has been set \naside,\u201d the court must determine a sentence \u201cbased on \nappropriate consideration of all of the factors listed in \n\u00a7 3553(a),\u201d without regard for prior rulings from the \ninitial sentencing. Pepper, 562 U.S. at 490. Among other \nthings, the probation officer must prepare a new \npresentence report (see Pet. App. 3a-4a; Dkt. 785, at 15), \nthe parties must submit new objections and responses \n(Dkts. 694, 699), and the court must hold a new hearing \nand consider and resolve the disagreements. See Concep-\ncion, 597 U.S. at 484.  \nThere is no conceivable reason that Congress would \nhave wanted district courts to continue imposing \u201cirra-\ntional, inhumane, and absurd\u201d sentences pursuant to a \n\u201ccruel and unjust\u201d sentencing rule (Hungerford, 465 \nF.3d at 1118 (Reinhardt, J., concurring)) that it had just \nrepealed retroactively for all pending cases. On the \ncontrary, lawmakers \u201cwanted the unfair practice\u201d of \nstacking \u201cstopped upon enactment\u201d (Uriarte, 975 F.3d at \n603) because they \u201crecognized that such lengthy sen-\ntences * * * were draconian and sought to end the \npractice\u201d (Henry, 983 F.3d at 225).  \nNo court and no party in any case presenting this \nissue has identified any reason why Congress would have \nintended for courts to continue to impose since-repu-\n\n35 \n \ndiated stacking rules in plenary resentencings. Simply \nput, there is none. Given \u201cthat Congress had determined \nthat the earlier sentencing structure resulted in sentences \nthat were too long and unfair,\u201d its goal was to \u201censur[e] \nthat those sentences would not be imposed on defendants \nyet to be sentenced,\u201d for whatever reason. Uriarte, 975 \nF.3d at 603. The Court is not required to turn a blind eye \nto that purpose, adopting an interpretation that does \nviolence to it rather than respecting it. \nB. Any ambiguity must be resolved in favor of \napplying section 403(a) to Hewitt \nIf, after all, there were any doubt about section \n403(b)\u2019s proper interpretation, the rule of lenity would \nrequire the Court to resolve it in Hewitt\u2019s favor. A penal \nstatute cannot be construed to impose a 105-year \nmandatory minimum sentence when another plausible \nreading would produce a 25-year mandatory minimum. \nNo matter the Court\u2019s view of the interpretations adopted \nby the Fifth, Sixth, and Eleventh Circuits, Hewitt\u2019s inter-\npretation is at the very least a plausible one. The rule of \nlenity thus requires the Court to adopt it.  \n1. The rule of lenity is an interpretive canon \u201cnot \nmuch less old than [statutory] construction itself.\u201d \nUnited States v. Wiltberger, 18 U.S. (5 Wheat.) 76, 95 \n(1820) (Marshall, C.J.). It demands that \u201cambiguity \nconcerning the ambit of criminal statutes should be \nresolved in favor of lenity.\u201d Skilling v. United States, 561 \nU.S. 358, 410 (2010) (quoting Cleveland v. United States, \n531 U.S. 12, 25 (2000)). It \u201capplies not only to \ninterpretations of the substantive ambit of criminal \nprohibitions, but also to the penalties they impose.\u201d \nBifulco v. United States, 447 U.S. 381, 387 (1980). \nSimply stated, \u201c[i]n the construction of a penal statute, it \nis well settled *\u202f*\u202f* that all reasonable doubts concerning \n\n36 \n \nits meaning ought to operate in favor of [the defendant].\u201d \nHarrison v. Vose, 50 U.S. (9 How.) 372, 378 (1850).  \nThe rule is grounded in the Constitution. It ensures \n\u201cthat the power of punishment is vested in the legislative, \nnot in the judicial department,\u201d for it is \u201cthe legislature, \nnot the Court, which is to define a crime, and ordain its \npunishment.\u201d Wiltberger, 18 U.S. (5 Wheat.) at 95; see \nalso Wooden v. United States, 595 U.S. 360, 388-392 \n(2022) (Gorsuch, J., concurring) (describing the due-\nprocess and separation-of-powers underpinnings).  \nThe rule of lenity applies when the ordinary tools of \nconstruction (\u201ctext, structure, and history\u201d) \u201cfail to \nestablish that\u201d the harsher reading is \u201cunambiguously \ncorrect.\u201d United States v. Granderson, 511 U.S. 39, 54 \n(1994). Lenity applies \u201cwhen, after consulting traditional \ncanons of statutory construction, [the Court is] left with \nan ambiguous statute.\u201d Shular v. United States, 589 U.S. \n154, 165 (2020) (quoting United States v. Shabani, 513 \nU.S. 10, 17 (1994)); see also Wooden, 595 U.S. at 392-\n393 (Gorsuch, J., concurring).  \n2. As we demonstrated in the preceding parts of this \nbrief, section 403(b) states plainly that Hewitt\u2019s plenary \nresentencing shall be subject to section 403(a). That is \nthe only reading consistent with the background rules \nagainst which Congress enacted the FSA, as well as the \nrelevant rules of grammar, the definitions of the terms \nused, the structure and scheme of the statute, and \nCongress\u2019s manifest purpose. \nIf for any reason the Court concludes that the lower \ncourt\u2019s alternative interpretation is a possible one, the \nrule of lenity would dictate that the ambiguity be resolved \nin Hewitt\u2019s favor. Indeed, this is a textbook case for \napplication of lenity. Defendants like Hewitt who are \nresentenced will receive drastically lower sentences \nunder our interpretation than they would under the Fifth, \n\n37 \n \nSixth, and Eleventh Circuits\u2019 construction. \u201c[L]enity \nmeans that the Court will not interpret a federal criminal \nstatute so as to increase the penalty that it places on an \nindividual when such an interpretation can be based on no \nmore than a guess as to what Congress intended.\u201d Bifulco, \n447 U.S. at 387 (quoting Ladner v. United States, 358 \nU.S. 169, 178 (1958)). To adopt the Fifth, Sixth, and \nEleventh Circuit\u2019s reading would mean making just such \na guess.  \nIf, after applying all the textual rules of construction, \nthe Court sees no one clear answer, then lenity requires \nreversal. Granderson proves the point. There, as here, the \nCourt addressed a question of statutory interpretation \nconcerning sentencing. 511 U.S. at 41. The practical \ndifference between the principal options was a mandatory \n20-month sentence (if the government was correct) or a \nmandatory two-month sentence (if the defendant was \ncorrect). Id. at 41-42. After evaluating the \u201ctext, \nstructure, and history\u201d and finding no clear answer, the \nCourt \u201cappl[ied] the rule of lenity and resolve[d] the \nambiguity in [the defendant\u2019s] favor.\u201d Id. at 54.  \nThe same process is required here. There is no \nquestion that Hewitt must be resentenced. Under our \ninterpretation of section 403(a), he would face a \nmandatory minimum of 25 years. Under the Fifth, Sixth, \nand Eleventh Circuits\u2019 construction, he would face a \nmandatory minimum of longer than 100 years at his \nresentencing. Were there any \u201creasonable doubt\u201d about \nthe construction of section 403(a), that doubt \u201cshould be \nresolved in favor of\u201d Hewitt. Wooden, 595 U.S. at 397 \n(Gorsuch, J., concurring). \n \n \n\n38 \n \nCONCLUSION \nThe Court should reverse and remand with instruc-\ntions to resentence Hewitt under section 403(a). \nRespectfully submitted. \nEugene R.

          "task_beliefs": "This observation, while not providing the specific document I sought (the merits reply brief), has unexpectedly enriched my understanding of the case's procedural history and the dynamics that brought it before the Court. My core uncertainty about the merits outcome remains, but the context surrounding it is now much clearer.\n\n*   **Core Conflict (Stable but Contextualized):** The central legal issue remains the textualist clash over the phrase \"if a sentence for the offense **has not been imposed as of such date of enactment**\" in Section 403(b) of the First Step Act. My understanding of the two competing interpretations\u2014the petitioner's \"legal nullity\" doctrine versus the amicus's \"historical fact\" reading\u2014is unchanged. I still lack the petitioner's direct rebuttal to the amicus.\n\n*   **Adversarial Structure (Revised and Deepened):** My previous model of a simple **Petitioner & U.S. Government vs. Court-Appointed Amicus** alignment was incomplete. The cert-stage reply brief reveals a more complex, two-phase dynamic:\n    *   **Certiorari Stage:** The alignment was **Petitioner vs. U.S. Government**. The government, despite agreeing the Fifth Circuit erred, argued against granting review, claiming the issue had \"limited prospective importance\" and that Congress might legislate a solution. The petitioner had to actively fight its future ally just to get the case heard.\n    *   **Merits Stage:** The alignment shifts to **Petitioner & U.S. Government vs. Court-Appointed Amicus**. This initial friction with the government is a significant detail, suggesting the government's support, while helpful on the merits, may not be unconditional.\n\n*   **Case Significance (Reinforced):** The cert-stage reply brief provides powerful evidence for why the Court granted review, strengthening my understanding of the case's importance.\n    *   **Deep, Entrenched Circuit Split:** The petitioner confirms a \"firmly entrenched\" 2-2 split (Third/Ninth Circuits vs. Fifth/Sixth Circuits) and notes related opinions from the Second, Fourth, and Seventh Circuits. This widespread disagreement makes Supreme Court intervention necessary for uniformity.\n    *   **High Stakes:** The brief emphasizes that the outcome represents \"a difference of decades or centuries of incarceration\" for many individuals, framing the issue as one of exceptional importance and liberty.\n    *   **Failure of Other Mechanisms:** The petitioner argues persuasively that further \"percolation\" in lower courts is pointless, and that the relevant bill in Congress is \"long-stalled\" with \"no realistic possibility\" of passing. This paints a picture where the Court is the only institution capable of resolving the issue.\n\n*   **State of Uncertainty (Stable but Better Informed):** My primary uncertainty remains unchanged: **Will the Justices favor the amicus's simpler textualism or the petitioner's more complex, procedurally-grounded \"legal nullity\" argument?** I still need the merits reply brief to see how the petitioner addresses the amicus's core points. However, I am now more confident about *why* the Court is interested in this question. The confirmed deep split and high stakes make it less likely the Court will seek a narrow, evasive ruling.",
          "design_beliefs": "This observation is a masterclass in the \"Failed Search as a Signal\" heuristic. While the refined search query successfully retrieved a document, it was the wrong one, revealing a critical flaw in my underlying model of the legal process and leading to a significant upgrade in my strategic framework.\n\n*   **Core Principles (Reinforced and Refined):**\n    *   **Model the Adversarial Process (Refined):** This principle is more critical than ever, but my model was too simple. I now understand the adversarial process unfolds in distinct stages (e.g., certiorari and merits), each with its own set of core documents (petition, opposition, reply). My model must now account for this multi-stage structure to avoid retrieving incorrect documents.\n\n*   **Applied Principles & Heuristics (Critique and Refinement):**\n    *   **\"Generalize Search Queries for Robustness\" (Vindicated but Insufficient):** The strategy of broadening my search from an exact title match to a keyword search (`'reply'`) worked perfectly on a technical level. It found the document. However, this success highlighted that a robust query is necessary but not sufficient. The query must also be specific to the correct procedural context.\n    *   **\"Verify Document Identity Beyond Title\" (Dramatically Refined):** This heuristic has evolved. Verification is not just about checking the party and document type. It's about checking the **procedural stage**. I learned to identify key phrases like \"On Petition for a Writ of Certiorari\" as markers for the cert stage, which is distinct from a merits brief \"On Writ of Certiorari.\"\n    *   **\"Failed Search as a Signal\" (Reaffirmed):** The retrieval of the wrong document was not a total failure but a crucial signal. It taught me that my mental map of the required documents was incomplete. The error was not in the search *execution* but in the search *premise*.\n\n*   **Emerging Heuristics / Next Steps (New and Solidified):**\n    *   **\"Distinguish Between Cert Stage and Merits Stage Filings\" (New, Critical Heuristic):** This is the primary lesson from this observation. To accurately model the dialectic and retrieve the correct documents, I must differentiate between filings related to the petition for certiorari and filings on the merits of the case after certiorari has been granted. This is a fundamental upgrade to my research methodology.\n    *   **\"Anticipate the Rebuttal to the Rebuttal\" (Reaffirmed):** My goal remains the same: obtain the petitioner's final argument. However, I now know I must specifically target the **merits reply brief**. My next information-gathering action must incorporate this new, more nuanced understanding to finally complete my model of the core legal arguments."

L. No. 115-391, \n132 Stat. 5194 (\u201cFSA\u201d), was a landmark, bipartisan \nreform to the federal criminal justice system. Its \nsentencing amendments\u2014Sections 401 and 403\u2014\nplayed a critical role in the law\u2019s passage. The \nquestion presented is whether Section 403\u2019s sentence \nreductions for firearm offenses apply to defendants \nwhose pre-enactment sentences are vacated and who \nare then resentenced post-enactment.  But resolving \nthis question will also decide how Section 401 should \nbe read. Section 401 modified sentence enhancements \nfor drug offenses\u2014the largest category of federal \ncrimes. These Section 401 reforms sought to reign in \na system of disproportionate, arbitrary punishments. \nUnder the old system, a difference of twelve years in \nprison could hinge on inconsistently applied, racially \ndisparate prosecutorial discretion that varied widely \nfrom district to district. This Court has already \ninterpreted portions of the First Step Act several \ntimes, and the provisions at issue here are equally \npressing. By granting certiorari in this case, the Court \nwill \nresolve \nthe \nnow-entrenched \ncircuit \nsplit \nundermining Congress\u2019 reforms. As a result, this \nCourt can transform the lives of those facing the \ndraconian sentences that Sections 401 and 403 sought \nto change. \n \n \n \n \n \n\n3 \n \n \nARGUMENT  \nI. Congress \npassed \noverdue, \nbipartisan \nsentencing reform in the First Step Act, \nimpacting tens of thousands of lives. \n1. The First Step Act is a sweeping criminal justice \nreform law, remarkable in its breadth and depth of \nsupport. Congress voted to pass the Act in 2018 by \noverwhelming margins: 87\u201312 in the Senate and 358\u2013\n36 in the House of Representatives. 164 Cong. Rec. \nS7,781 (daily ed. Dec. 18, 2018); 164 Cong. Rec. \nH10,430 (daily ed. Dec. 20, 2018). At its signing, \nPresident Donald J. Trump hailed the Act as \u201can \nincredible moment\u201d for criminal justice reform, and \nnoted the law\u2019s \u201cunheard of\u201d level of bipartisan \nsupport.2 The Act included three major parts: (1) \nsentencing reform through changes to the penalties \nfor some federal crimes; (2) correctional reform \nthrough creation of a Bureau of Prisons (BOP) risk \nand needs assessment system; and (3) reauthorization \nof the Second Chance Act of 2007.3  \n2. The FSA addressed the increasingly obvious \nflaws in federal sentencing. \u201cInflexible mandatory \nminimum sentences\u201d for nonviolent offenders had \ntriggered \u201can explosion in our Federal prisons,\u201d while \nfailing to \u201cdeter drug use or drug crime.\u201d 164 Cong. \nRec. S7,644 (daily ed. Dec. 17, 2018) (statement of \nSen. Durbin). Operating under rigid mandatory \n \n2 Remarks by President Trump at Signing Ceremony for S. 756, \nthe \u201cFirst Step Act of 2018\u201d and H.R. 6964, the \u201cJuvenile Justice \nReform Act of 2018,\u201d 2018 WL 6715859, at *16 (Dec. 21, 2018). \n3 Congressional Rsrch.

As a \nresult, federal sentencing laws had \u201ccreated racially \ndiscriminatory outcomes and increased overcrowding \nand costs.\u201d4 \nBy enacting the First Step Act, \u201cCongress sought \nto recalibrate its approach.\u201d Pulsifer v. United States, \nNo. 22-340, slip op. at 1, 601 U.S. ____ (2024) \n(Gorsuch, J., dissenting). The law was a \u201chistoric\u201d \nexample of Congress \u201cputting [its] words into action\u201d \nafter \u201cyears talking about reducing crime, enacting \nfair sentencing laws, and restoring lives.\u201d 164 Cong. \nRec. H10,364 (daily ed. Dec. 20, 2018) (statement of \nRep. Sensenbrenner). The law\u2019s passage showcased \nbipartisan legislating \u201con a scale not often seen in \nWashington these days.\u201d 164 Cong. Rec. S7,839 (daily \ned. Dec. 19, 2018) (statement of Sen. Grassley). \nSenator Charles E. Grassley noted that Congress has \nrarely had legislation before it with \u201csuch diverse \ngroups of people and organizations that support the \nbill.\u201d 164 Cong. Rec. S7,778 (daily ed. Dec. 18, 2018). \nThe coalition behind the First Step Act ranged from \nthe American Civil Liberties Union to the Fraternal \nOrder of Police and the Association of Prosecuting \nAttorneys. 164 Cong. Rec. S7,839 (daily ed. Dec. 19, \n2018) (statement of Sen. Grassley). Senator Patrick \nLeahy called the bill \u201cnot just bipartisan; it is nearly \nnonpartisan.\u201d 164 Cong. Rec. S7,749 (daily ed. Dec. \n18, 2018). As President Trump said from the Oval \n \n4 President Donald J.

According to \nthe lead sponsors of the bill, without the sentencing \nreforms, \u201cmuch of the Act\u2019s support would have fallen \naway.\u201d Brief for United States Senators Richard J. \nDurbin et al. as Amici Curiae Supporting Defendant-\nAppellant 1\u20132, Terry v. United States, 141 S. Ct. 1858 \n(2021) (No. 20-5904). Indeed, \u201c[t]he Act might not \nhave passed at all.\u201d Id. at 2. Today, the Act\u2019s \nsentencing reforms promise \u201cmore individuals the \nchance \nto \navoid \none-size-fits-all \nmandatory \nminimums.\u201d Pulsifer, slip op. at 1 (Gorsuch, J., \ndissenting). And one of the chief provisions among the \nlaw\u2019s \n\u201carray\u201d \nof \nreforms: \n\u201cIt \nnarrowed \nthe \ncircumstances under which a court could \u2018stack\u2019 \ncertain mandatory minimums on top of one another.\u201d \nId. (citing First Step Act \u00a7 403(a)). \nRecidivism data confirm that the sentencing \nmodifications are working. The architects of the First \nStep Act aimed to \u201creform the federal prison system \nso that those exiting the system do not return.\u201d6 \nOverall, around 45% of released federal offenders are \n \n5 Remarks by President Trump at Signing Ceremony for S. 756, \nthe \u201cFirst Step Act of 2018\u201d and H.R. 6964, the \u201cJuvenile Justice \nReform Act of 2018,\u201d 2018 WL 6715859, at *2 (Dec. 21, 2018). \n6 U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, The First Step Act of 2018: Risk and Needs \nAssessment System vii (2019), https://perma.cc/U3E6-SDUL. \n\n6 \n \n \nre-arrested or return to prison within three years.7 \nBut among the approximately 30,000 individuals \ngranted an expedited release under the First Step Act, \nonly 12% have been rearrested or reincarcerated.8 \nAnalysis from the nonpartisan think tank Council on \nCriminal Justice finds that people released under the \nFSA reforms since its passage have a 37% lower \nrecidivism rate compared with similarly situated \nindividuals released from federal prisons before the \nlaw.9 The FSA\u2019s interventions have reduced people\u2019s \ntime in prison without sacrificing public safety.   \n3. This Court and the courts of appeals have \nconfirmed that the Act\u2019s interpretation warrants \nattention. This very term in Pulsifer v. United States, \nthe Court stressed the First Step Act\u2019s importance, \ncalling it a \u201csignificant sentencing reform law.\u201d \nPulsifer, slip op. at 26. The Court also emphasized the \nneed to interpret the FSA\u2019s provisions consistently. \nId. (explaining that this Court granted certiorari to \nsettle a circuit split by determining when a defendant \nis eligible for the Act\u2019s safety-valve relief). The Sixth \nCircuit has recognized that the First Step Act \u201cis the \nproduct of a remarkable bipartisan effort to remedy \npast \noverzealous \nuse \nof \nmandatory-minimum \n \n7 U.S. Gov\u2019t Accountability Off., Federal Prisons: Bureau of \nPrisons Should Improve Efforts to Implement its Risk and Needs \nAssessment System 1 (Mar. 20, 2023), https://perma.cc/YP8W-\n7J3M. \n8 U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, First Step Act Annual Report 41 (Apr. \n2023), https://perma.cc/MV79-2R7S. \n9 New CCJ Analysis Estimates First Step Act Releases Have \nLower Recidivism Rates, Arrests, Council on Criminal Justice \n(Aug. 22, 2023), https://perma.cc/9HJE-ZFMC. \n\n7 \n \n \nsentences and harsh sentences for drug-offenders.\u201d \nUnited States v. Henry, 983 F.3d 214, 218 (6th Cir. \n2020). The Seventh Circuit has described the Act as a \n\u201chistoric, bipartisan attempt by Congress to take the \nlessons of the past and to formulate a new sentencing \npolicy for the United States.\u201d United States v. Uriarte, \n975 F.3d 596, 605 (7th Cir. 2020). And this Court has \nalready considered a handful of cases involving the \nAct in the five years since its passage. See, e.g., \nPulsifer, slip. op.; Concepcion v. United States, 142 S. \nCt. 2389 (2022); Terry v. United States, 141 S. Ct. 1858 \n(2021). Construing the Act\u2019s language clearly merits \nthe Court\u2019s time\u2014particularly in the face of a \nhardened circuit conflict like this. \nII. Taking up the question presented allows this \nCourt to also interpret Section 401(c)\u2019s \nsentence reforms for drug offenses. \n  The petition presents the question of whether \nSection 403 applies to vacated sentences. Petitioner \nhas explained the importance of this provision, which \neliminates the practice of \u201cstacking\u201d firearm offenses. \nBut interpreting Section 403 also impacts those with \nvacated sentences under Section 401, which reformed \nsentence enhancements for drug offenders. United \nStates v. Bethea, 841 F. App\u2019x 544, 548 n.5 (4th Cir. \n2021) (Sections 401(c) and 403(b) construed to have \nsame meaning). Further, the Fifth Circuit has now \njoined the Sixth in a reading of these provisions that \nconflicts with the Ninth and the Third Circuits. See \nPet. 6\u20139.  Thus, the split has deepened since this \nCourt denied review of the same question presented \nin Carpenter v. United States (No. 23-531). Mr. \nHewitt\u2019s case presents the Court with the opportunity \n\n8 \n \n \nto both reconcile a circuit split and settle the meaning \nof two crucial provisions in the First Step Act\u2019s \nsentencing reforms.  \nA. Drug offenders represent the largest \ncategory of federal prisoners. \nMore federal inmates are in prison for drug \noffenses than any other category of crime. In fact, \ntwice as many individuals are in our federal prisons \nfor drug crimes (more than 44%) than for the next \nlargest \ncategory: \ncrimes \ninvolving \nweapons, \nexplosives, and arson (about 22%).10 Sixty-seven \npercent of drug offenders were convicted of an offense \ncarrying a mandatory minimum penalty and almost \nhalf of those individuals remained subject to that \npenalty at sentencing.11 On top of that mandatory \nminimum, an individual may face a sentence \nenhancement based on past offenses. A 2018 U.S. \nSentencing \nCommission \nstudy \nfound \nthat \napproximately one third of drug offenders qualified for \nsentence enhancements\u2014more than 6,000 people.12  \n \n10 Federal Bureau of Prisons, Offenses (Apr. 6, 2024), \nhttps://perma.cc/A7RR-39X7. \n11 U.S. Sentencing Comm\u2019n, Quick Facts on Mandatory \nMinimum Penalties 2 (2022), https://perma.cc/4SNE-25VP. \n12 U.S. Sentencing Comm\u2019n, Report-At-A-Glance: Federal Drug \nRecidivism Enhancements 1 (2018), https://perma.cc/XWG9-\n5JW8. \n\n9 \n \n \nB. Section 401 mitigated the frequency and \nseverity of sentence enhancements for \ndrug offenses, helping to remedy the \nharsh and arbitrary application of these \npenalties. \n1. Section 401 changed the mandatory-minimum \nsentencing enhancements under the Controlled \nSubstances Act, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 801 et seq., and the \nControlled Substances Import and Export Act, 21 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 951 et seq. Prosecutors may seek sentence \nenhancements \nbased \non \na \ndefendant\u2019s \nprior \nconvictions by following the proceedings described in \n21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851.13 Sentencing enhancements under \nboth \nlaws \nare \ntherefore \nknown \nas \n\u201c851 \nenhancements.\u201d14  \n2. Prior to the First Step Act, 851 enhancements \nforced judges to levy harsh penalties on drug \noffenders. The enhancement for a defendant with a \nsingle qualifying drug offense was a mandatory \nminimum of twenty years. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b) \n(amended 2018). If the defendant had two or more \nqualifying offenses, that mandatory minimum became \nlife. Id. Moreover, the old law set a low bar for what \nconstituted a qualifying drug offense\u2014any drug crime \npunishable by more than a year\u2019s imprisonment \nsufficed, including simple possession. See id. \u00a7 802(44) \n \n13 Section 962 of the Controlled Substances Act incorporates by \nreference the procedures stated in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851, making \nSection 851 the operative provision across both statutes. 21 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 962. \n14 See, e.g., U.S. Sentencing Comm\u2019n, Application and Impact of \nSection 851 Enhancements (July 2018), https://perma.cc/7NXA-\n4ZLP. \n\n10 \n \n \n(defining a \u201cfelony drug offense\u201d as one punishable by \nimprisonment for more than one year). This definition \nswept in defendants who were sentenced to less than \na year, released before a year was up, or were \nsentenced to probation alone. An individual who had \nbeen convicted of one prior felony drug offense twenty \nyears \nearlier \ncould \nget \nthe \nsame \nsentence \nenhancement as someone who had been found guilty \nof the same offense only one year ago. The system \ntreated all felony drug offenders identically. \nThese sentence enhancements were not only \ndraconian; they were also inconsistently applied.  A \n2011 study on mandatory minimum sentences found \nthat in most judicial districts, between one quarter \nand one half of all drug offenders qualified for a \nsentence enhancement; in a third of districts, the rate \nwas as high as 50% to 75%.15 The number of \ndefendants actually sentenced with enhancements \nwas lower, but worryingly, the Commission found \n\u201csignificant variation in the manner in which the \nenhancement provision was applied.\u201d 2011 Report, \nsupra, at 260. For example, in six districts more than \n75% of eligible defendants received the enhancement, \nbut in eight districts, no eligible offenders received it. \nId. at 260\u201361. Based on these findings, the \n \n15 U.S. Sentencing Comm\u2019n, 2011 Report to the Congress: \nMandatory Minimum Penalties in the Federal Criminal Justice \nSystem 260 (2011), https://perma.cc/DT3U-D3RR [hereinafter \n2011 Report]. \n\n11 \n \n \nCommission recommended that Congress \u201creassess \nthe severity and scope of 851 enhancements.\u201d16 \nIn early 2018, the Commission undertook a study \nwholly focused on 851 enhancements. The report \nfound that, although almost a third of drug offenders \nqualified for sentence enhancements, application of \nthe enhancements continued to vary wildly, \u201cranging \nfrom five districts in which an 851 enhancement was \nsought against more than 50% of eligible drug \ntrafficking offenders to nineteen districts in which the \nenhancement was not sought against any of the \neligible offenders.\u201d17 Further, the report unearthed \ntroubling racial disparities. Black offenders accounted \nfor 42% of those who qualified for sentence \nenhancements but made up a staggering 58% of those \nwho received enhancements. 2018 Report, supra, at \n34 tbl.5.  By contrast, 26% of white offenders were \neligible for enhancements, yet only 24% received \nthem. Id.  \nDefendants suffered major consequences if a court \nsentenced them under the enhanced sentencing \nregime. The Commission found that, if a prosecutor \nchose not to seek an enhanced sentence, offenders \notherwise eligible for the enhancement received an \naverage sentence of seven years. Id. at 7. By contrast, \nwhen the prosecutor did seek the enhancement, it \n \n16 U.S. Sentencing Comm\u2019n, Application and Impact of Section \n851 \nEnhancements: \nKey \nFindings \n(July \n2018), \nhttps://perma.cc/RL7S-BV84. \n17 U.S. Sentencing Comm\u2019n, Application and Impact of 21 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 851: Enhanced Penalties for Federal Drug Trafficking \nOffenders \n6 \n(July \n2018), \nhttps://perma.cc/AKH6-7WTS \n[hereinafter 2018 Report]. \n\n12 \n \n \nadded another twelve years to the sentence on \naverage, more than doubling the individual\u2019s time in \nprison. Id. In other words, similarly situated \ndefendants were receiving sentences that varied by \nmore than a decade\u2014seven years for some and \nnineteen years for others. The data depicted an \narbitrary system, where punishment turned not on \nthe actions of the defendant, but on the prosecutor and \ndistrict in which the defendant was sentenced.   \n3. Section 401 of the First Step Act sought to \nmitigate the severity of 851 enhancements in two \nways. First, the provision restricted which crimes \nqualified as predicates for most mandatory-minimum \nsentences. Only drug trafficking offenses for which \nthe defendant had served more than twelve months of \nimprisonment now qualified. First Step Act of 2018, \nPub. L. No. 115-391, \u00a7 401(a)(1), 132 Stat. 5194, 5221, \n21 U.S.C. \u00a7 802(57). Additionally, offenses that were \nmore than fifteen years old could no longer support an \nenhanced sentence. Id. Second, Section 401 reduced \nthe severity of sentence enhancements. For example, \nfor a defendant convicted under \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A) who \nhas a single prior qualifying offense, the mandatory \nminimum enhancement dropped from twenty to \nfifteen \nyears. \nId. \n\u00a7 401(a)(2)(A)(i), \n21 \nU.S.C. \n\u00a7 841(b)(1)(A).  If the same defendant had two prior \nqualifying \noffenses, \nthe \nmandatory \nminimum \nenhancement changed from life in prison to twenty-\nfive \nyears. \nId. \n\u00a7 \n401(a)(2)(A)(ii), \n21 \nU.S.C. \n\u00a7 841(b)(1)(A). Because of these changes, defendants \nwith two predicate offenses sentenced today have the \nchance to return home to their families instead of \nspending their lives in prison.  \n\n13 \n \n \nThe amendments made an immediate impact. \nDrug offenders receiving enhanced penalties dropped \nfrom 1,001 in 2018 to 849 in 2019.18 In 2018, the \ntwenty-year enhanced mandatory minimum had been \napplied to 321 offenders. Id. In 2019, the revised \nfifteen-year minimum was applied to 219 people. Id. \nIn 2018, enhanced sentencing consigned forty-two \ndrug offenders to life in prison. Id. In 2019, that \nnumber dropped to eleven. Id.  \n4. By narrowing the pool of eligible defendants and \nlessening the length of enhanced sentences, Section \n401 of the First Step Act mitigated the system\u2019s worst \nexcesses. Still, the harshness of the old regime follows \ndefendants who were originally sentenced before the \nAct\u2019s passage and whose sentences have now been \nvacated. With the courts of appeals openly at odds, \nonly geography dictates whether an individual will \nbenefit fr\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

L. No. 115-391, \n132 Stat. 5194 (\u201cFSA\u201d), was a landmark, bipartisan \nreform to the federal criminal justice system. Its \nsentencing amendments\u2014Sections 401 and 403\u2014\nplayed a critical role in the law\u2019s passage. The \nquestion presented is whether Section 403\u2019s sentence \nreductions for firearm offenses apply to defendants \nwhose pre-enactment sentences are vacated and who \nare then resentenced post-enactment.  But resolving \nthis question will also decide how Section 401 should \nbe read. Section 401 modified sentence enhancements \nfor drug offenses\u2014the largest category of federal \ncrimes. These Section 401 reforms sought to reign in \na system of disproportionate, arbitrary punishments. \nUnder the old system, a difference of twelve years in \nprison could hinge on inconsistently applied, racially \ndisparate prosecutorial discretion that varied widely \nfrom district to district. This Court has already \ninterpreted portions of the First Step Act several \ntimes, and the provisions at issue here are equally \npressing. By granting certiorari in this case, the Court \nwill \nresolve \nthe \nnow-entrenched \ncircuit \nsplit \nundermining Congress\u2019 reforms. As a result, this \nCourt can transform the lives of those facing the \ndraconian sentences that Sections 401 and 403 sought \nto change. \n \n \n \n \n \n\n3 \n \n \nARGUMENT  \nI. Congress \npassed \noverdue, \nbipartisan \nsentencing reform in the First Step Act, \nimpacting tens of thousands of lives. \n1. The First Step Act is a sweeping criminal justice \nreform law, remarkable in its breadth and depth of \nsupport. Congress voted to pass the Act in 2018 by \noverwhelming margins: 87\u201312 in the Senate and 358\u2013\n36 in the House of Representatives. 164 Cong. Rec. \nS7,781 (daily ed. Dec. 18, 2018); 164 Cong. Rec. \nH10,430 (daily ed. Dec. 20, 2018). At its signing, \nPresident Donald J. Trump hailed the Act as \u201can \nincredible moment\u201d for criminal justice reform, and \nnoted the law\u2019s \u201cunheard of\u201d level of bipartisan \nsupport.2 The Act included three major parts: (1) \nsentencing reform through changes to the penalties \nfor some federal crimes; (2) correctional reform \nthrough creation of a Bureau of Prisons (BOP) risk \nand needs assessment system; and (3) reauthorization \nof the Second Chance Act of 2007.3  \n2. The FSA addressed the increasingly obvious \nflaws in federal sentencing. \u201cInflexible mandatory \nminimum sentences\u201d for nonviolent offenders had \ntriggered \u201can explosion in our Federal prisons,\u201d while \nfailing to \u201cdeter drug use or drug crime.\u201d 164 Cong. \nRec. S7,644 (daily ed. Dec. 17, 2018) (statement of \nSen. Durbin). Operating under rigid mandatory \n \n2 Remarks by President Trump at Signing Ceremony for S. 756, \nthe \u201cFirst Step Act of 2018\u201d and H.R. 6964, the \u201cJuvenile Justice \nReform Act of 2018,\u201d 2018 WL 6715859, at *16 (Dec. 21, 2018). \n3 Congressional Rsrch. Serv., The First Step Act of 2018: An \nOverview 1 (Mar. 4, 2019),\u00a0https://perma.cc/UYR6-SHTJ. \n\n4 \n \n \nminimums, judges could not \u201cdistinguish between \ndrug kingpins . . . and lower level offenders.\u201d Id. As a \nresult, federal sentencing laws had \u201ccreated racially \ndiscriminatory outcomes and increased overcrowding \nand costs.\u201d4 \nBy enacting the First Step Act, \u201cCongress sought \nto recalibrate its approach.\u201d Pulsifer v. United States, \nNo. 22-340, slip op. at 1, 601 U.S. ____ (2024) \n(Gorsuch, J., dissenting). The law was a \u201chistoric\u201d \nexample of Congress \u201cputting [its] words into action\u201d \nafter \u201cyears talking about reducing crime, enacting \nfair sentencing laws, and restoring lives.\u201d 164 Cong. \nRec. H10,364 (daily ed. Dec. 20, 2018) (statement of \nRep. Sensenbrenner). The law\u2019s passage showcased \nbipartisan legislating \u201con a scale not often seen in \nWashington these days.\u201d 164 Cong. Rec. S7,839 (daily \ned. Dec. 19, 2018) (statement of Sen. Grassley). \nSenator Charles E. Grassley noted that Congress has \nrarely had legislation before it with \u201csuch diverse \ngroups of people and organizations that support the \nbill.\u201d 164 Cong. Rec. S7,778 (daily ed. Dec. 18, 2018). \nThe coalition behind the First Step Act ranged from \nthe American Civil Liberties Union to the Fraternal \nOrder of Police and the Association of Prosecuting \nAttorneys. 164 Cong. Rec. S7,839 (daily ed. Dec. 19, \n2018) (statement of Sen. Grassley). Senator Patrick \nLeahy called the bill \u201cnot just bipartisan; it is nearly \nnonpartisan.\u201d 164 Cong. Rec. S7,749 (daily ed. Dec. \n18, 2018). As President Trump said from the Oval \n \n4 President Donald J. Trump Calls on Congress to Pass the \nFIRST \nSTEP \nAct, \nWhiteHouse.gov \n(Nov. \n14, \n2018), \nhttps://perma.cc/H6SW-Q9VF. \n\n5 \n \n \nOffice, its supporters included \u201ca cross-section of \neverybody in our country.\u201d5 \nThe sentencing overhaul was a feature of the First \nStep Act\u2019s bipartisan appeal, not a bug. According to \nthe lead sponsors of the bill, without the sentencing \nreforms, \u201cmuch of the Act\u2019s support would have fallen \naway.\u201d Brief for United States Senators Richard J. \nDurbin et al. as Amici Curiae Supporting Defendant-\nAppellant 1\u20132, Terry v. United States, 141 S. Ct. 1858 \n(2021) (No. 20-5904). Indeed, \u201c[t]he Act might not \nhave passed at all.\u201d Id. at 2. Today, the Act\u2019s \nsentencing reforms promise \u201cmore individuals the \nchance \nto \navoid \none-size-fits-all \nmandatory \nminimums.\u201d Pulsifer, slip op. at 1 (Gorsuch, J., \ndissenting).

This Court and the courts of appeals have \nconfirmed that the Act\u2019s interpretation warrants \nattention. This very term in Pulsifer v. United States, \nthe Court stressed the First Step Act\u2019s importance, \ncalling it a \u201csignificant sentencing reform law.\u201d \nPulsifer, slip op. at 26. The Court also emphasized the \nneed to interpret the FSA\u2019s provisions consistently. \nId.

Uriarte, \n975 F.3d 596, 605 (7th Cir. 2020). And this Court has \nalready considered a handful of cases involving the \nAct in the five years since its passage.

Construing the Act\u2019s language clearly merits \nthe Court\u2019s time\u2014particularly in the face of a \nhardened circuit conflict like this. \nII. Taking up the question presented allows this \nCourt to also interpret Section 401(c)\u2019s \nsentence reforms for drug offenses. \n  The petition presents the question of whether \nSection 403 applies to vacated sentences. Petitioner \nhas explained the importance of this provision, which \neliminates the practice of \u201cstacking\u201d firearm offenses. \nBut interpreting Section 403 also impacts those with \nvacated sentences under Section 401, which reformed \nsentence enhancements for drug offenders. United \nStates v. Bethea, 841 F. App\u2019x 544, 548 n.5 (4th Cir. \n2021) (Sections 401(c) and 403(b) construed to have \nsame meaning). Further, the Fifth Circuit has now \njoined the Sixth in a reading of these provisions that \nconflicts with the Ninth and the Third Circuits. See \nPet. 6\u20139.  Thus, the split has deepened since this \nCourt denied review of the same question presented \nin Carpenter v. United States (No. 23-531). Mr. \nHewitt\u2019s case presents the Court with the opportunity \n\n8 \n \n \nto both reconcile a circuit split and settle the meaning \nof two crucial provisions in the First Step Act\u2019s \nsentencing reforms.  \nA. Drug offenders represent the largest \ncategory of federal prisoners. \nMore federal inmates are in prison for drug \noffenses than any other category of crime. In fact, \ntwice as many individuals are in our federal prisons \nfor drug crimes (more than 44%) than for the next \nlargest \ncategory: \ncrimes \ninvolving \nweapons, \nexplosives, and arson (about 22%).10 Sixty-seven \npercent of drug offenders were convicted of an offense \ncarrying a mandatory minimum penalty and almost \nhalf of those individuals remained subject to that \npenalty at sentencing.11 On top of that mandatory \nminimum, an individual may face a sentence \nenhancement based on past offenses. A 2018 U.S. \nSentencing \nCommission \nstudy \nfound \nthat \napproximately one third of drug offenders qualified for \nsentence enhancements\u2014more than 6,000 people.12  \n \n10 Federal Bureau of Prisons, Offenses (Apr. 6, 2024), \nhttps://perma.cc/A7RR-39X7. \n11 U.S. Sentencing Comm\u2019n, Quick Facts on Mandatory \nMinimum Penalties 2 (2022), https://perma.cc/4SNE-25VP. \n12 U.S. Sentencing Comm\u2019n, Report-At-A-Glance: Federal Drug \nRecidivism Enhancements 1 (2018), https://perma.cc/XWG9-\n5JW8. \n\n9 \n \n \nB. Section 401 mitigated the frequency and \nseverity of sentence enhancements for \ndrug offenses, helping to remedy the \nharsh and arbitrary application of these \npenalties. \n1. Section 401 changed the mandatory-minimum \nsentencing enhancements under the Controlled \nSubstances Act, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 801 et seq., and the \nControlled Substances Import and Export Act, 21 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 951 et seq. Prosecutors may seek sentence \nenhancements \nbased \non \na \ndefendant\u2019s \nprior \nconvictions by following the proceedings described in \n21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851.13 Sentencing enhancements under \nboth \nlaws \nare \ntherefore \nknown \nas \n\u201c851 \nenhancements.\u201d14  \n2. Prior to the First Step Act, 851 enhancements \nforced judges to levy harsh penalties on drug \noffenders. The enhancement for a defendant with a \nsingle qualifying drug offense was a mandatory \nminimum of twenty years. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b) \n(amended 2018). If the defendant had two or more \nqualifying offenses, that mandatory minimum became \nlife. Id. Moreover, the old law set a low bar for what \nconstituted a qualifying drug offense\u2014any drug crime \npunishable by more than a year\u2019s imprisonment \nsufficed, including simple possession. See id. \u00a7 802(44) \n \n13 Section 962 of the Controlled Substances Act incorporates by \nreference the procedures stated in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851, making \nSection 851 the operative provision across both statutes. 21 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 962. \n14 See, e.g., U.S. Sentencing Comm\u2019n, Application and Impact of \nSection 851 Enhancements (July 2018), https://perma.cc/7NXA-\n4ZLP. \n\n10 \n \n \n(defining a \u201cfelony drug offense\u201d as one punishable by \nimprisonment for more than one year). This definition \nswept in defendants who were sentenced to less than \na year, released before a year was up, or were \nsentenced to probation alone. An individual who had \nbeen convicted of one prior felony drug offense twenty \nyears \nearlier \ncould \nget \nthe \nsame \nsentence \nenhancement as someone who had been found guilty \nof the same offense only one year ago. The system \ntreated all felony drug offenders identically. \nThese sentence enhancements were not only \ndraconian; they were also inconsistently applied.  A \n2011 study on mandatory minimum sentences found \nthat in most judicial districts, between one quarter \nand one half of all drug offenders qualified for a \nsentence enhancement; in a third of districts, the rate \nwas as high as 50% to 75%.15 The number of \ndefendants actually sentenced with enhancements \nwas lower, but worryingly, the Commission found \n\u201csignificant variation in the manner in which the \nenhancement provision was applied.\u201d 2011 Report, \nsupra, at 260. For example, in six districts more than \n75% of eligible defendants received the enhancement, \nbut in eight districts, no eligible offenders received it. \nId. at 260\u201361. Based on these findings, the \n \n15 U.S. Sentencing Comm\u2019n, 2011 Report to the Congress: \nMandatory Minimum Penalties in the Federal Criminal Justice \nSystem 260 (2011), https://perma.cc/DT3U-D3RR [hereinafter \n2011 Report]. \n\n11 \n \n \nCommission recommended that Congress \u201creassess \nthe severity and scope of 851 enhancements.\u201d16 \nIn early 2018, the Commission undertook a study \nwholly focused on 851 enhancements. The report \nfound that, although almost a third of drug offenders \nqualified for sentence enhancements, application of \nthe enhancements continued to vary wildly, \u201cranging \nfrom five districts in which an 851 enhancement was \nsought against more than 50% of eligible drug \ntrafficking offenders to nineteen districts in which the \nenhancement was not sought against any of the \neligible offenders.\u201d17 Further, the report unearthed \ntroubling racial disparities. Black offenders accounted \nfor 42% of those who qualified for sentence \nenhancements but made up a staggering 58% of those \nwho received enhancements. 2018 Report, supra, at \n34 tbl.5.  By contrast, 26% of white offenders were \neligible for enhancements, yet only 24% received \nthem. Id.  \nDefendants suffered major consequences if a court \nsentenced them under the enhanced sentencing \nregime. The Commission found that, if a prosecutor \nchose not to seek an enhanced sentence, offenders \notherwise eligible for the enhancement received an \naverage sentence of seven years. Id. at 7. By contrast, \nwhen the prosecutor did seek the enhancement, it \n \n16 U.S. Sentencing Comm\u2019n, Application and Impact of Section \n851 \nEnhancements: \nKey \nFindings \n(July \n2018), \nhttps://perma.cc/RL7S-BV84. \n17 U.S. Sentencing Comm\u2019n, Application and Impact of 21 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 851: Enhanced Penalties for Federal Drug Trafficking \nOffenders \n6 \n(July \n2018), \nhttps://perma.cc/AKH6-7WTS \n[hereinafter 2018 Report]. \n\n12 \n \n \nadded another twelve years to the sentence on \naverage, more than doubling the individual\u2019s time in \nprison. Id. In other words, similarly situated \ndefendants were receiving sentences that varied by \nmore than a decade\u2014seven years for some and \nnineteen years for others. The data depicted an \narbitrary system, where punishment turned not on \nthe actions of the defendant, but on the prosecutor and \ndistrict in which the defendant was sentenced.   \n3. Section 401 of the First Step Act sought to \nmitigate the severity of 851 enhancements in two \nways. First, the provision restricted which crimes \nqualified as predicates for most mandatory-minimum \nsentences. Only drug trafficking offenses for which \nthe defendant had served more than twelve months of \nimprisonment now qualified. First Step Act of 2018, \nPub. L. No. 115-391, \u00a7 401(a)(1), 132 Stat. 5194, 5221, \n21 U.S.C. \u00a7 802(57). Additionally, offenses that were \nmore than fifteen years old could no longer support an \nenhanced sentence. Id. Second, Section 401 reduced \nthe severity of sentence enhancements. For example, \nfor a defendant convicted under \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A) who \nhas a single prior qualifying offense, the mandatory \nminimum enhancement dropped from twenty to \nfifteen \nyears. \nId. \n\u00a7 401(a)(2)(A)(i), \n21 \nU.S.C. \n\u00a7 841(b)(1)(A).  If the same defendant had two prior \nqualifying \noffenses, \nthe \nmandatory \nminimum \nenhancement changed from life in prison to twenty-\nfive \nyears. \nId. \n\u00a7 \n401(a)(2)(A)(ii), \n21 \nU.S.C. \n\u00a7 841(b)(1)(A). Because of these changes, defendants \nwith two predicate offenses sentenced today have the \nchance to return home to their families instead of \nspending their lives in prison.  \n\n13 \n \n \nThe amendments made an immediate impact. \nDrug offenders receiving enhanced penalties dropped \nfrom 1,001 in 2018 to 849 in 2019.18 In 2018, the \ntwenty-year enhanced mandatory minimum had been \napplied to 321 offenders. Id. In 2019, the revised \nfifteen-year minimum was applied to 219 people. Id. \nIn 2018, enhanced sentencing consigned forty-two \ndrug offenders to life in prison. Id. In 2019, that \nnumber dropped to eleven. Id.  \n4. By narrowing the pool of eligible defendants and \nlessening the length of enhanced sentences, Section \n401 of the First Step Act mitigated the system\u2019s worst \nexcesses. Still, the harshness of the old regime follows \ndefendants who were originally sentenced before the \nAct\u2019s passage and whose sentences have now been \nvacated. With the courts of appeals openly at odds, \nonly geography dictates whether an individual will \nbenefit from the FSA\u2019s changes. For the typical \ndefendant eligible for an 851 sentence enhancement, \nthe difference amounts to years, if not decades, of \nextra time in prison.  \nThe FSA\u2019s sentencing modifications garnered \nbipartisan support and have transformed numerous \nlives over the last five years. Yet the entrenched \ncircuit conflict prevents Sections 401 and 403 from \napplying nationwide. It is time for this Court to take \nup the question presented and construe the law\u2019s \nreforms as Congress intended. \n \n18 See U.S. Sentencing Comm\u2019n, The First Step Act of 2018: One \nYear of Implementation (Aug. 2020), https://perma.cc/QMZ5-\nYKC7. \n\n14 \n \n \nCONCLUSION \nFor the reasons set forth above, this Court should \ngrant certiorari.  \nRespectfully submitted, \n \nJeffrey T.

          "task_beliefs": "I have successfully obtained the petitioner's opening merits brief. While this is not the reply brief I was seeking, it is arguably a more foundational document, providing a comprehensive map of the petitioner's legal strategy. My understanding of the case has deepened considerably, shifting from a high-level summary to a granular analysis of the specific legal arguments being deployed.\n\n*   **Core Conflict (Dramatically Sharpened):** The central legal clash over the interpretation of Section 403(b) is now crystal clear from the petitioner's perspective. Their argument is a multi-pronged assault on the Fifth Circuit's \"historical fact\" reading.\n    *   **The \"Legal Nullity\" Doctrine (Deepened):** This is the cornerstone of the petitioner's case. They argue that a vacated sentence is a legal nullity, meaning it is treated as if it never existed. Therefore, it cannot be \"a sentence for the offense\" under the statute. This argument is not just a clever turn of phrase; the petitioner grounds it in centuries of Anglo-American jurisprudence, citing cases as far back as 1592 (`Eyre v. Woodfine`) and foundational Supreme Court cases like `United States v. Munsingwear` and `North Carolina v. Pearce`. This transforms the argument from a simple procedural point into a claim rooted in deep legal tradition.\n    *   **Textual & Grammatical Argument (Newly Specified):** The petitioner dissects the statutory phrase \"if a sentence for the offense **has not been imposed as of such date**.\" They argue the use of the present perfect tense (\"has been imposed\") combined with the preposition \"as of\" refers to a state that must persist up to the date of enactment. A sentence that was imposed but later vacated does not persist; its legal force has been extinguished. They argue an ordinary English speaker would not say a sentence \"has been imposed\" if it no longer has any effect.\n    *   **Purposive & Structural Argument (Reinforced):** The brief powerfully articulates that Congress's primary goal with Section 403 was to end the \"unjust and irrational\" practice of sentence stacking. The only countervailing principle is respecting the finality of judgments. The petitioner argues that when a sentence is vacated for independent reasons (like the *Davis* decision), the case is no longer final. It is pending, and finality concerns are moot, meaning the court should apply the new, more lenient sentencing law at the *de novo* resentencing.\n    *   **Rule of Lenity (Confirmed as Fallback):** As anticipated, the petitioner explicitly argues that if any ambiguity remains after considering text, structure, and purpose, the rule of lenity requires the court to interpret the statute in the defendant's favor.\n\n*   **Adversarial Structure (Stable):** The brief confirms my model of the merits-stage alignment: **Petitioner & U.S. Government vs. Court-Appointed Amicus**. It explicitly states, \"As the government now agrees, no ordinary English speaker would say that a sentence 'has been imposed as of December 21, 2018' if the sentence was vacated...\"\n\n*   **State of Uncertainty (Shifted and Focused):** My primary uncertainty no longer concerns the *nature* of the petitioner's argument, but the *strength of the counterargument*. I now have a detailed blueprint of the petitioner's case. The most pressing questions are:\n    1.  How will the court-appointed amicus dismantle this comprehensive textual, doctrinal, and purposive argument?\n    2.  Will the amicus argue that \"imposed\" is a simple historical fact, a single past event that cannot be undone by subsequent vacatur for the purposes of this specific statute's look-back provision?\n    3.  Will the amicus find case law to counter the petitioner's deep well of \"vacatur as nullity\" precedent?\n    My next crucial step is to obtain the **Brief for the Court-Appointed Amicus Curiae**, which will contain the direct rebuttal to the arguments I now understand in detail. After that, the petitioner's **merits reply brief** will become essential to see the final exchange.",
          "design_beliefs": "This observation marks a pivotal moment in refining my research methodology. For the second time, a \"failed search\" has provided a more valuable lesson than a successful one would have. My model of the legal process is becoming increasingly sophisticated.\n\n*   **Core Principles (Refined):**\n    *   **Model the Adversarial Process (Refined Again):** My understanding of the adversarial process has evolved from a simple two-sided conflict, to a multi-stage process (cert vs. merits), and now to a specific, ordered sequence of filings *within* the merits stage. The dialectic follows a predictable rhythm: **1. Petitioner's Opening Brief \u2192 2. Respondent's/Amicus's Answering Brief \u2192 3. Petitioner's Reply Brief.** My previous attempts to find the reply brief first were procedurally illogical.\n\n*   **Applied Principles & Heuristics (Critique and Refinement):**\n    *   **\"Failed Search as a Signal\" (Reaffirmed and Elevated):** This heuristic is proving to be one of the most powerful tools for learning. The mismatch between my query (`'reply brief'`) and the result (`'opening brief'`) was a direct signal that my model of the \"document universe\" was incorrect. The error was not in the search, but in the flawed premise that a reply brief would exist before an answering brief.\n    *   **\"Verify Document Identity Beyond Title\" (Vindicated):** My refined verification process worked perfectly. By examining the document's header (\"On Writs of Certiorari\"), table of contents, and introduction, I correctly identified it as an opening merits brief, despite its filename and my initial query. This prevented me from misinterpreting its contents as a rebuttal.\n\n*   **Emerging Heuristics / Next Steps (New and Solidified):**\n    *   **\"Map the Document Universe Before Searching\" (New, Critical Heuristic):** I must not search for documents randomly. I need to first construct a mental map of the expected filings based on the case's procedural posture. For a merits-stage case, this map is now clear: opening brief, answering brief(s), reply brief.\n    *   **\"Search Sequentially Following the Legal Dialectic\" (New, Action-Guiding Heuristic):** My information-gathering strategy must now actively mirror the chronological flow of legal argument. I cannot look for the rebuttal before I have the argument. My next search must be for the document that *responds* to the one I just found.\n    *   **\"Anticipate the Rebuttal to the Rebuttal\" (Reaffirmed but Re-contextualized):** My goal of finding the petitioner's final word remains, but I now understand it is the *final* piece of a three-part puzzle. I must acquire the pieces in order. The highest priority is now the **Brief for the Court-Appointed Amicus Curiae**, as it contains the central counterargument that the petitioner will ultimately have to rebut."
