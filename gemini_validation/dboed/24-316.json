      "Does the structure of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force violate the Constitution\u2019s Appointments Clause?",

    "facts_of_the_case": "In 2010, Congress passed the Affordable Care Act (ACA), which requires private insurers to cover certain preventive-care services without cost sharing. Rather than defining these services directly, the ACA empowers three agencies within the Department of Health and Human Services to determine required services: the United States Preventive Services Task Force (Task Force), the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), and the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA). The Task Force consists of sixteen volunteer experts serving four-year terms, ACIP has fifteen members selected by the HHS Secretary, and HRSA operates through offices and bureaus reporting to the HHS Secretary.\n\nOver the years, these agencies issued various preventive care recommendations, including ACIP\u2019s 2007 recommendation for HPV vaccines, HRSA\u2019s 2011 guidelines for contraceptive coverage, and the Task Force\u2019s 2019 recommendation for HIV prevention drugs (PrEP). Four individuals and two Christian-based businesses in Texas challenged these requirements, arguing that mandatory coverage of these services violated their religious beliefs by making them \u201ccomplicit in facilitating homosexual behavior, drug use, and sexual activity outside of marriage between one man and one woman.\u201d\n\nThe plaintiffs filed suit in 2020 against the federal government and various department secretaries, primarily arguing that the structure of these agencies violated the Appointments Clause of the Constitution. The district court ruled in their favor regarding the Task Force but rejected their challenges to ACIP and HRSA, and both parties appealed. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit held that the Task Force\u2019s structure violated the Appointments Clause and upheld the injunction against enforcing its recommendations, but reversed the district court\u2019s universal remedies and remanded for further consideration of whether HHS properly ratified ACIP and HRSA\u2019s recommendations.",

This will help me build my model of design effectiveness (D). For example, I'll want to know about recent precedents like *Seila Law* or *Collins v.

Under the Patient Protection and Af-\nfordable Care Act, Pub. L. No. 111-148, 124 Stat. 119, \nhealth insurance issuers and group health plans must \ncover certain preventive services recommended by the \nTask Force without imposing any cost-sharing require-\nments on patients.  42 U.S.C. 300gg-13(a)(1).  The ques-\ntion presented is as follows: \nWhether the court of appeals erred in holding that \nthe structure of the Task Force violates the Appoint-\nments Clause, U.S. Const. Art. II, \u00a7 2, Cl. 2, and in de-\nclining to sever the statutory provision that it found to \nunduly insulate the Task Force from the HHS Secre-\ntary\u2019s supervision.     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n(II) \nPARTIES TO THE PROCEEDING  \nPetitioners (defendants-appellants/cross-appellees \nbelow) are Xavier Becerra, in his official capacity as \nSecretary of Health and Human Services; Janet Yellen, \nin her official capacity as Secretary of the Treasury; Ju-\nlie A.

Su, Acting \nSecretary of Labor; and the United States of America, \nrespectfully petitions for a writ of certiorari to review \nthe judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for \nthe Fifth Circuit in this case. \nOPINIONS BELOW \nThe opinion of the court of appeals (App., infra, 1a-\n48a) is reported at 104 F.4th 930.  The memorandum \nopinions and orders of the district court (App., infra, \n49a-84a, 85a-136a) are reported at 666 F. Supp. 3d 613 \nand 627 F. Supp. 3d 624.  \n\n2 \n \nJURISDICTION \nThe judgment of the court of appeals was entered on \nJune 21, 2024.  The jurisdiction of this Court is invoked \nunder 28 U.S.C. 1254(1). \nCONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY  \nPROVISIONS INVOLVED \nPertinent constitutional and statutory provisions are \nreproduced in the appendix to this petition.  App., infra, \n137a-143a.  \nSTATEMENT \nCongress has long instructed the U.S. Preventive \nServices Task Force (Task Force) to recommend pre-\nventive medical services, such as screenings and medi-\ncations to avoid serious health conditions.  The Task \nForce sits within the Public Health Service, over which \nthe Secretary of HHS (Secretary) exercises supervi-\nsory authority.  In the Patient Protection and Afforda-\nble Care Act (ACA or Act), Pub. L. No. 111-148, 124 \nStat. 119, Congress required that health insurance issu-\ners and group health plans cover certain preventive ser-\nvices recommended by the Task Force without impos-\ning any cost-sharing requirements on patients.  42 \nU.S.C. 300gg-13(a)(1).  The court of appeals held that \nthe Task Force\u2019s structure violates the Appointments \nClause of the Constitution, Art. II, \u00a7 2, Cl. 2, even \nthough the court agreed that the Secretary may remove \nTask Force members at will.  And the court then de-\nclined to sever the statutory provision that it found to \nunduly insulate the Task Force from oversight by the \nSecretary.  The court\u2019s holding jeopardizes healthcare \nprotections that have been in place for 14 years and that \nmillions of Americans currently enjoy.  \n\n3 \n \nA. Legal Background \n1. Preventive services include screenings and medi-\ncations to avoid serious health conditions.  Such \u201cser-\nvices can help people avoid acute illness, identify and \ntreat chronic conditions, prevent cancer or lead to ear-\nlier detection, and improve health.\u201d  HHS, Issue Brief\u2014\nAccess to Preventive Services without Cost-Sharing: \nEvidence from the Affordable Care Act 1 (Jan. 11, 2022), \nhttps://perma.cc/BGV4-N8U2 (Access to Preventive \nServices).  Overall, \u201c[u]se of preventive services results \nin a healthier population and reduces health care costs \nby helping individuals avoid preventable conditions and \nreceive treatment earlier.\u201d  78 Fed. Reg. 39,870, 39,872 \n(July 2, 2013).   \nIn 1984, the Public Health Service within HHS con-\nvened the first panel of the Task Force, composed of \n\u201cnationally recognized non-Federal experts in preven-\ntion and evidence-based medicine.\u201d  D. Ct. Doc. 65, at \n70 (Jan. 28, 2022).  For four decades, the Task Force has \n\u201cworked to fulfill its mission of improving the health of \nall Americans\u201d by evaluating the evidence for various \ntreatments and services to promote public health.  Ibid.  \nThe Task Force \u201creview[s] the scientific evidence re-\nlated to the effectiveness, appropriateness, and cost- \neffectiveness of clinical preventive services for the pur-\npose of developing recommendations for the health care \ncommunity, and updating previous clinical preventive \nrecommendations.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 299b-4(a)(1).  It pub-\nlishes its recommendations \u201cin the Guide to Clinical \nPreventive Services,\u201d a resource for medical profession-\nals, Congress, and other policy makers.  Ibid.  Task \nForce recommendations have been cited by this Court \nas a medical authority concerning \u201cwhich tests are most \n\n4 \n \nusefully administered and when,\u201d Metro-North Com-\nmuter R.R. v. Buckley, 521 U.S. 424, 441 (1997), and by \nPresident Bush in \u201cencourag[ing] all women to consult \nwith their physicians to obtain appropriate [breast can-\ncer] screenings,\u201d Proclamation No. 7711, National \nBreast Cancer Awareness Month, 2003, 3 C.F.R. 115 \n(2003 Comp.). \nCongress codified the Task Force\u2019s role in 1999 by \nauthorizing the Director of the Agency for Healthcare \nResearch and Quality (AHRQ), an agency within the \nPublic Health Service, to \u201cperiodically convene\u201d the \nTask Force.  Healthcare Research and Quality Act of \n1999, Pub. L. No. 106-129, sec. 2(a), \u00a7 915(a)(1), 113 Stat. \n1659; see 42 U.S.C. 299b-4(a)(1).  The Task Force is cur-\nrently composed of 16 members who are appointed for \nfour-year terms, D. Ct. Doc. 65, at 71, although there \nare no statutory restrictions on a member\u2019s removal  \nbefore the expiration of his or her term, see 42 \nU.S.C. 299b-4(a) (2018 & Supp. IV 2022).  Congress \nspecified that \u201c[a]ll members of the Task Force  * * *  \nand any recommendations made by such members, shall \nbe independent and, to the extent practicable, not sub-\nject to political pressure.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 299b-4(a)(6). \nAt the same time, Congress has given the Secretary \nsignificant supervisory authority over the Public Health \nService, which includes AHRQ and the Task Force.  In \nReorganization Plan No. 3 of 1966 (Reorganization \nPlan), 80 Stat. 1610, the Secretary was transferred \u201call \nfunctions of the Public Health Service\u201d and its \u201coffic-\ners,\u201d \u201cemployees,\u201d and \u201cagencies,\u201d \u00a7 1(a), 80 Stat. 1610; \nsee Pub. L. No. 98-532, 98 Stat. 2705.  The Secretary \nwas further empowered to \u201cmake such provisions as he \nshall deem appropriate authorizing the performance of \n\n5 \n \nany of the functions transferred to him by the provi-\nsions of this reorganization plan by any officer, em-\nployee, or agency\u201d of the Public Health Service or HHS.  \n\u00a7 2, 80 Stat. 1610.  And the Secretary is also authorized \nto \u201csupervis[e] and direct[]\u201d the Public Health Service, \n42 U.S.C. 202, and to \u201ccarry out\u201d AHRQ\u2019s mission and \nduties by \u201cacting through [its] Director,\u201d 42 U.S.C. 299(a).      \n2. The ACA seeks to ensure that all Americans have \naccess to quality, affordable health insurance coverage.  \nOne of the Act\u2019s reforms requires health insurance is-\nsuers and group health plans to cover certain preven-\ntive services without imposing copayments, deductibles, \nor other cost-sharing charges.  42 U.S.C. 300gg-13.  \nCongress did not create a fixed list of covered preven-\ntive services, but rather provided for coverage of cate-\ngories of services based on the current recommenda-\ntions of medical experts, including the Task Force.  The \nAct accordingly requires coverage for \u201cevidence-based \nitems or services that have in effect a rating of \u2018A\u2019 or \u2018B\u2019 \nin the current recommendations of the United States \nPreventive Services Task Force.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 300gg-\n13(a)(1).1  The Act further specifies that \u201c[t]he Secre-\ntary shall establish a minimum interval between the \ndate on which a recommendation  * * *  is issued\u201d and \nthe date on which issuers and plans must cover the rec-\nommended service without cost sharing for a new plan \nyear.  42 U.S.C. 300gg-13(b). \nSince the ACA\u2019s enactment, millions of Americans \n \n1 The Task Force issues \u201cA\u201d recommendations for services that \nhave a high certainty of a substantial net benefit; \u201cB\u201d recommenda-\ntions for services that have at least a moderate certainty of a mod-\nerate net benefit; and \u201cC\u201d recommendations for services that have \nat least a moderate certainty of a small net benefit.  D. Ct. Doc. 65, \nat 117.  \n\n6 \n \nhave enjoyed coverage without cost sharing for critical \npreventive services that are proven to save lives.  See \nAccess to Preventive Services 1; D. Ct. Doc. 121-1, at 2 \n(Apr. 12, 2023).  The Task Force\u2019s current recommen-\ndations give \u201cA\u201d or \u201cB\u201d ratings to more than 50 preven-\ntive services.  U.S. Preventive Servs. Task Force, A & B \nRecommendations, https://perma.cc/FC9Y-Y3DN (A \n& B Recommendations).  Among many other things, \nthose services include screenings to detect lung, cervi-\ncal, and colorectal cancer; screenings to detect diabetes; \nstatin medications to reduce the risk of heart disease \nand strokes; medications to prevent HIV; physical ther-\napy for older adults to prevent falls; and eye ointment \nfor newborns to prevent blindness-causing infections.  \nIbid.   \nB. The Present Controversy \n1. Respondents are four individuals and two small \nbusinesses who object to Congress\u2019s directive that \nhealth insurance issuers and group health plans gener-\nally must cover preventive services without cost shar-\ning.  App., infra, 7a.  Five of the six respondents \u201cdo not \ncurrently participate in the health care market.\u201d  Id. at \n62a; see D. Ct. Doc. 111-1, \u00b6 5 (Jan. 6, 2023); D. Ct. Doc. \n111-2, \u00b6\u00b6 5-6 (Jan. 6, 2023); D. Ct. Doc. 111-3, \u00b6 5 (Jan. \n6, 2023).  Those respondents nonetheless object to the \nACA\u2019s requirement that issuers and plans cover preex-\nposure prophylaxis (PrEP) medications, which the Task \nForce has assigned an \u201cA\u201d rating based on their effec-\ntiveness at preventing HIV infection in certain at-risk \nindividuals.  See D. Ct. Doc. 14, at 8, 10-11 (July 20, \n2020).  Those respondents state that PrEP medications \n\u201cencourage and facilitate homosexual behavior,\u201d which \nconflicts with their religious beliefs.  Id. at 8.   \n\n7 \n \nBraidwood Management is the only respondent that \ncurrently participates in the health insurance market.  \nApp., infra, 55a.  Braidwood offers coverage to its ap-\nproximately 70 employees through a self-insured plan.  \nIbid.  Its owner wishes to exclude from that plan \u201ccov-\nerage of preventive care such as  * * *  PrEP drugs\u201d \nbecause he \u201cobjects to coverage of those services on re-\nligious grounds.\u201d  Ibid.  Braidwood does not allege, how-\never, that any of its employees have ever sought cover-\nage for PrEP medications. \n2. Respondents filed this suit in the United States \nDistrict Court for the Northern District of Texas.  As \nrelevant here, respondents contend that the Task \nForce\u2019s structure violates the Appointments Clause, \nU.S. Const. Art. II, \u00a7 2, Cl. 2, because, in their view, \nTask Force members are principal officers of the \nUnited States who have not been appointed by the Pres-\nident with the advice and consent of the Senate.  App., \ninfra, 8a.  Respondents\u2019 operative complaint seeks in-\njunctive and declaratory relief but does not seek vaca-\ntur under Section 706(2) of the Administrative Proce-\ndure Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. 706(2).  D. Ct. Doc. 14, at 13-\n18.  After this suit was filed, the Secretary ratified all \nTask Force \u201cA\u201d and \u201cB\u201d recommendations then cur-\nrently in effect.  D. Ct. Doc. 65, at 6.2    \n \n2 Respondents also asserted various other claims, including Ap-\npointments Clause challenges to two other bodies within HHS\u2014the \nAdvisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) and the \nHealth Resources and Services Administration (HRSA)\u2014that issue \nrecommendations and guidelines that insurance issuers and group \nhealth plans are required to cover without cost sharing.  See App., \ninfra, 5a-6a, 8a; 42 U.S.C. 300gg-13(a)(2)-(4).  The district court re-\njected those Appointments Clause challenges, App., infra, 102a-\n106a, but the court of appeals reversed and remanded for consider-\nation of respondents\u2019 argument that the Secretary\u2019s ratification of \n\n8 \n \nThe district court granted summary judgment to re-\nspondents.  App., infra, 85a-136a.  The court held that \nTask Force members are principal officers who must be \nappointed by the President with the advice and consent \nof the Senate.  Id. at 115a.  The court acknowledged that \n\u201cno statute forbids\u201d the \u201cSecretary[] or AHRQ Director \nfrom firing any member of\u201d the Task Force.  Id. at 119a.  \nBut the court nonetheless concluded that Task Force \nmembers \u201chave no superior,\u201d because the Secretary \n\u201cneither directs nor supervises [the Task Force] or its \nmembers.\u201d  Id. at 115a-116a.3    \nThe district court declined to construe or sever the \nrelevant statutory provision to avoid the Appointments \nClause problem it identified.  App., infra, 80a-82a.  Spe-\ncifically, the court rejected the government\u2019s argument \nthat the provision rendering Task Force members and \ntheir recommendations \u201cindependent and, to the extent \npracticable, not subject to political pressure,\u201d 42 U.S.C. \n299b-4(a)(6), could plausibly be read to allow the Secre-\ntary to review the Task Force\u2019s \u201cA\u201d and \u201cB\u201d recommen-\ndations before they bind insurance issuers and group \nhealth plans.  App., infra, 81a.  The court observed that \neven if the statute could be read to \u201cpermit the Secre-\ntary to authorize or reject [Task Force] recommenda-\ntions post hoc,\u201d it \u201cwould not compel him to take such \naction.\u201d  Ibid.  The court recognized that this Court in \nUnited States v. Arthrex, Inc., 594 U.S. 1 (2021), had \n \nACIP and HRSA recommendations and guidelines required notice \nand comment under the APA, id. at 43a-47a.  Those separate claims \nare not at issue in this petition.  \n3 In the district court, the government primarily contended that \nTask Force members are not officers of the United States subject \nto the Appointments Clause.  See D. Ct. Doc. 64, at 50-56 (Jan. 28, \n2022); App., infra, 107a-114a. \n\n9 \n \n\u201ccur[ed]\u201d an Appointments Clause violation by severing \na statutory provision to ensure that administrative pa-\ntent judges\u2019 decisions would \u201cbe subject to the review of \nthe PTO Director.\u201d  App., infra, 81a.  But the district \ncourt deemed Arthrex \u201cinapplicable\u201d based on its view \nthat the Task Force is not \u201csubject to the Secretary\u2019s \n\u2018supervision and direction.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Ibid. (citation omitted).    \nAs a remedy for the identified Appointments Clause \nviolation, the district court not only granted party- \nspecific relief, but also ordered \u201c[u]niversal\u201d relief \nbased\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n83: 20240919152847189_certificate20Briadwood20petition.json (score: 0.468)\nNo.   \n \nIN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES \n _________________ \n \nXAVIER BECERRA, SECRETARY OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, ET AL., \nPETITIONERS \n \nv. \n  \n BRAIDWOOD MANAGEMENT, INC., ET AL.  \n \n_______________ \n \n \n \nCERTIFICATE OF SERVICE \n \n \nIt is hereby certified that all parties required to be served have been served with copies of \nthe PETITION FOR A WRIT OF CERTIORARI, via email and first-class mail, postage \nprepaid, this 19th day of September 2024. \n \n[See Attached Service List] \n \nAs required by Supreme Court Rule 33.1(h), I certify that the document contain 8671 words, \nexcluding the parts of the document that are exempted by Supreme Court Rule 33.1(d).

Supp. 3d 624.  \n\n2 \n \nJURISDICTION \nThe judgment of the court of appeals was entered on \nJune 21, 2024.  The jurisdiction of this Court is invoked \nunder 28 U.S.C. 1254(1). \nCONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY  \nPROVISIONS INVOLVED \nPertinent constitutional and statutory provisions are \nreproduced in the appendix to this petition.  App., infra, \n137a-143a.  \nSTATEMENT \nCongress has long instructed the U.S. Preventive \nServices Task Force (Task Force) to recommend pre-\nventive medical services, such as screenings and medi-\ncations to avoid serious health conditions.  The Task \nForce sits within the Public Health Service, over which \nthe Secretary of HHS (Secretary) exercises supervi-\nsory authority.  In the Patient Protection and Afforda-\nble Care Act (ACA or Act), Pub. L. No. 111-148, 124 \nStat. 119, Congress required that health insurance issu-\ners and group health plans cover certain preventive ser-\nvices recommended by the Task Force without impos-\ning any cost-sharing requirements on patients.  42 \nU.S.C. 300gg-13(a)(1).  The court of appeals held that \nthe Task Force\u2019s structure violates the Appointments \nClause of the Constitution, Art. II, \u00a7 2, Cl. 2, even \nthough the court agreed that the Secretary may remove \nTask Force members at will.  And the court then de-\nclined to sever the statutory provision that it found to \nunduly insulate the Task Force from oversight by the \nSecretary.  The court\u2019s holding jeopardizes healthcare \nprotections that have been in place for 14 years and that \nmillions of Americans currently enjoy.  \n\n3 \n \nA. Legal Background \n1. Preventive services include screenings and medi-\ncations to avoid serious health conditions.  Such \u201cser-\nvices can help people avoid acute illness, identify and \ntreat chronic conditions, prevent cancer or lead to ear-\nlier detection, and improve health.\u201d  HHS, Issue Brief\u2014\nAccess to Preventive Services without Cost-Sharing: \nEvidence from the Affordable Care Act 1 (Jan. 11, 2022), \nhttps://perma.cc/BGV4-N8U2 (Access to Preventive \nServices).  Overall, \u201c[u]se of preventive services results \nin a healthier population and reduces health care costs \nby helping individuals avoid preventable conditions and \nreceive treatment earlier.\u201d  78 Fed. Reg. 39,870, 39,872 \n(July 2, 2013).   \nIn 1984, the Public Health Service within HHS con-\nvened the first panel of the Task Force, composed of \n\u201cnationally recognized non-Federal experts in preven-\ntion and evidence-based medicine.\u201d  D. Ct. Doc. 65, at \n70 (Jan. 28, 2022).  For four decades, the Task Force has \n\u201cworked to fulfill its mission of improving the health of \nall Americans\u201d by evaluating the evidence for various \ntreatments and services to promote public health.  Ibid.  \nThe Task Force \u201creview[s] the scientific evidence re-\nlated to the effectiveness, appropriateness, and cost- \neffectiveness of clinical preventive services for the pur-\npose of developing recommendations for the health care \ncommunity, and updating previous clinical preventive \nrecommendations.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 299b-4(a)(1).  It pub-\nlishes its recommendations \u201cin the Guide to Clinical \nPreventive Services,\u201d a resource for medical profession-\nals, Congress, and other policy makers.  Ibid.  Task \nForce recommendations have been cited by this Court \nas a medical authority concerning \u201cwhich tests are most \n\n4 \n \nusefully administered and when,\u201d Metro-North Com-\nmuter R.R. v. Buckley, 521 U.S. 424, 441 (1997), and by \nPresident Bush in \u201cencourag[ing] all women to consult \nwith their physicians to obtain appropriate [breast can-\ncer] screenings,\u201d Proclamation No. 7711, National \nBreast Cancer Awareness Month, 2003, 3 C.F.R. 115 \n(2003 Comp.). \nCongress codified the Task Force\u2019s role in 1999 by \nauthorizing the Director of the Agency for Healthcare \nResearch and Quality (AHRQ), an agency within the \nPublic Health Service, to \u201cperiodically convene\u201d the \nTask Force.  Healthcare Research and Quality Act of \n1999, Pub. L. No. 106-129, sec. 2(a), \u00a7 915(a)(1), 113 Stat. \n1659; see 42 U.S.C. 299b-4(a)(1).  The Task Force is cur-\nrently composed of 16 members who are appointed for \nfour-year terms, D. Ct. Doc. 65, at 71, although there \nare no statutory restrictions on a member\u2019s removal  \nbefore the expiration of his or her term, see 42 \nU.S.C. 299b-4(a) (2018 & Supp. IV 2022).  Congress \nspecified that \u201c[a]ll members of the Task Force  * * *  \nand any recommendations made by such members, shall \nbe independent and, to the extent practicable, not sub-\nject to political pressure.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 299b-4(a)(6). \nAt the same time, Congress has given the Secretary \nsignificant supervisory authority over the Public Health \nService, which includes AHRQ and the Task Force.  In \nReorganization Plan No. 3 of 1966 (Reorganization \nPlan), 80 Stat. 1610, the Secretary was transferred \u201call \nfunctions of the Public Health Service\u201d and its \u201coffic-\ners,\u201d \u201cemployees,\u201d and \u201cagencies,\u201d \u00a7 1(a), 80 Stat. 1610; \nsee Pub. L. No. 98-532, 98 Stat. 2705.  The Secretary \nwas further empowered to \u201cmake such provisions as he \nshall deem appropriate authorizing the performance of \n\n5 \n \nany of the functions transferred to him by the provi-\nsions of this reorganization plan by any officer, em-\nployee, or agency\u201d of the Public Health Service or HHS.  \n\u00a7 2, 80 Stat. 1610.  And the Secretary is also authorized \nto \u201csupervis[e] and direct[]\u201d the Public Health Service, \n42 U.S.C. 202, and to \u201ccarry out\u201d AHRQ\u2019s mission and \nduties by \u201cacting through [its] Director,\u201d 42 U.S.C. 299(a).      \n2. The ACA seeks to ensure that all Americans have \naccess to quality, affordable health insurance coverage.  \nOne of the Act\u2019s reforms requires health insurance is-\nsuers and group health plans to cover certain preven-\ntive services without imposing copayments, deductibles, \nor other cost-sharing charges.  42 U.S.C. 300gg-13.  \nCongress did not create a fixed list of covered preven-\ntive services, but rather provided for coverage of cate-\ngories of services based on the current recommenda-\ntions of medical experts, including the Task Force.  The \nAct accordingly requires coverage for \u201cevidence-based \nitems or services that have in effect a rating of \u2018A\u2019 or \u2018B\u2019 \nin the current recommendations of the United States \nPreventive Services Task Force.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 300gg-\n13(a)(1).1  The Act further specifies that \u201c[t]he Secre-\ntary shall establish a minimum interval between the \ndate on which a recommendation  * * *  is issued\u201d and \nthe date on which issuers and plans must cover the rec-\nommended service without cost sharing for a new plan \nyear.  42 U.S.C. 300gg-13(b). \nSince the ACA\u2019s enactment, millions of Americans \n \n1 The Task Force issues \u201cA\u201d recommendations for services that \nhave a high certainty of a substantial net benefit; \u201cB\u201d recommenda-\ntions for services that have at least a moderate certainty of a mod-\nerate net benefit; and \u201cC\u201d recommendations for services that have \nat least a moderate certainty of a small net benefit.  D. Ct. Doc. 65, \nat 117.  \n\n6 \n \nhave enjoyed coverage without cost sharing for critical \npreventive services that are proven to save lives.  See \nAccess to Preventive Services 1; D. Ct. Doc. 121-1, at 2 \n(Apr. 12, 2023).  The Task Force\u2019s current recommen-\ndations give \u201cA\u201d or \u201cB\u201d ratings to more than 50 preven-\ntive services.  U.S. Preventive Servs. Task Force, A & B \nRecommendations, https://perma.cc/FC9Y-Y3DN (A \n& B Recommendations).  Among many other things, \nthose services include screenings to detect lung, cervi-\ncal, and colorectal cancer; screenings to detect diabetes; \nstatin medications to reduce the risk of heart disease \nand strokes; medications to prevent HIV; physical ther-\napy for older adults to prevent falls; and eye ointment \nfor newborns to prevent blindness-causing infections.  \nIbid.   \nB. The Present Controversy \n1. Respondents are four individuals and two small \nbusinesses who object to Congress\u2019s directive that \nhealth insurance issuers and group health plans gener-\nally must cover preventive services without cost shar-\ning.  App., infra, 7a.  Five of the six respondents \u201cdo not \ncurrently participate in the health care market.\u201d  Id. at \n62a; see D. Ct. Doc. 111-1, \u00b6 5 (Jan. 6, 2023); D. Ct. Doc. \n111-2, \u00b6\u00b6 5-6 (Jan. 6, 2023); D. Ct. Doc. 111-3, \u00b6 5 (Jan. \n6, 2023).  Those respondents nonetheless object to the \nACA\u2019s requirement that issuers and plans cover preex-\nposure prophylaxis (PrEP) medications, which the Task \nForce has assigned an \u201cA\u201d rating based on their effec-\ntiveness at preventing HIV infection in certain at-risk \nindividuals.  See D. Ct. Doc. 14, at 8, 10-11 (July 20, \n2020).  Those respondents state that PrEP medications \n\u201cencourage and facilitate homosexual behavior,\u201d which \nconflicts with their religious beliefs.  Id. at 8.   \n\n7 \n \nBraidwood Management is the only respondent that \ncurrently participates in the health insurance market.  \nApp., infra, 55a.  Braidwood offers coverage to its ap-\nproximately 70 employees through a self-insured plan.  \nIbid.  Its owner wishes to exclude from that plan \u201ccov-\nerage of preventive care such as  * * *  PrEP drugs\u201d \nbecause he \u201cobjects to coverage of those services on re-\nligious grounds.\u201d  Ibid.  Braidwood does not allege, how-\never, that any of its employees have ever sought cover-\nage for PrEP medications. \n2. Respondents filed this suit in the United States \nDistrict Court for the Northern District of Texas.  As \nrelevant here, respondents contend that the Task \nForce\u2019s structure violates the Appointments Clause, \nU.S. Const. Art. II, \u00a7 2, Cl. 2, because, in their view, \nTask Force members are principal officers of the \nUnited States who have not been appointed by the Pres-\nident with the advice and consent of the Senate.  App., \ninfra, 8a.  Respondents\u2019 operative complaint seeks in-\njunctive and declaratory relief but does not seek vaca-\ntur under Section 706(2) of the Administrative Proce-\ndure Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. 706(2).  D. Ct. Doc. 14, at 13-\n18.  After this suit was filed, the Secretary ratified all \nTask Force \u201cA\u201d and \u201cB\u201d recommendations then cur-\nrently in effect.  D. Ct. Doc. 65, at 6.2    \n \n2 Respondents also asserted various other claims, including Ap-\npointments Clause challenges to two other bodies within HHS\u2014the \nAdvisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) and the \nHealth Resources and Services Administration (HRSA)\u2014that issue \nrecommendations and guidelines that insurance issuers and group \nhealth plans are required to cover without cost sharing.  See App., \ninfra, 5a-6a, 8a; 42 U.S.C. 300gg-13(a)(2)-(4).  The district court re-\njected those Appointments Clause challenges, App., infra, 102a-\n106a, but the court of appeals reversed and remanded for consider-\nation of respondents\u2019 argument that the Secretary\u2019s ratification of \n\n8 \n \nThe district court granted summary judgment to re-\nspondents.  App., infra, 85a-136a.  The court held that \nTask Force members are principal officers who must be \nappointed by the President with the advice and consent \nof the Senate.  Id. at 115a.  The court acknowledged that \n\u201cno statute forbids\u201d the \u201cSecretary[] or AHRQ Director \nfrom firing any member of\u201d the Task Force.  Id. at 119a.  \nBut the court nonetheless concluded that Task Force \nmembers \u201chave no superior,\u201d because the Secretary \n\u201cneither directs nor supervises [the Task Force] or its \nmembers.\u201d  Id. at 115a-116a.3    \nThe district court declined to construe or sever the \nrelevant statutory provision to avoid the Appointments \nClause problem it identified.  App., infra, 80a-82a.  Spe-\ncifically, the court rejected the government\u2019s argument \nthat the provision rendering Task Force members and \ntheir recommendations \u201cindependent and, to the extent \npracticable, not subject to political pressure,\u201d 42 U.S.C. \n299b-4(a)(6), could plausibly be read to allow the Secre-\ntary to review the Task Force\u2019s \u201cA\u201d and \u201cB\u201d recommen-\ndations before they bind insurance issuers and group \nhealth plans.  App., infra, 81a.  The court observed that \neven if the statute could be read to \u201cpermit the Secre-\ntary to authorize or reject [Task Force] recommenda-\ntions post hoc,\u201d it \u201cwould not compel him to take such \naction.\u201d  Ibid.  The court recognized that this Court in \nUnited States v. Arthrex, Inc., 594 U.S. 1 (2021), had \n \nACIP and HRSA recommendations and guidelines required notice \nand comment under the APA, id. at 43a-47a.  Those separate claims \nare not at issue in this petition.  \n3 In the district court, the government primarily contended that \nTask Force members are not officers of the United States subject \nto the Appointments Clause.  See D. Ct. Doc. 64, at 50-56 (Jan. 28, \n2022); App., infra, 107a-114a. \n\n9 \n \n\u201ccur[ed]\u201d an Appointments Clause violation by severing \na statutory provision to ensure that administrative pa-\ntent judges\u2019 decisions would \u201cbe subject to the review of \nthe PTO Director.\u201d  App., infra, 81a.  But the district \ncourt deemed Arthrex \u201cinapplicable\u201d based on its view \nthat the Task Force is not \u201csubject to the Secretary\u2019s \n\u2018supervision and direction.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Ibid. (citation omitted).    \nAs a remedy for the identified Appointments Clause \nviolation, the district court not only granted party- \nspecific relief, but also ordered \u201c[u]niversal\u201d relief \nbased on its reading of Section 706(2) of the APA, even \nthough respondents had not raised an APA claim in \ntheir operative complaint.  App., infra, 72a (emphasis \nomitted).  The court vacated \u201c[a]ll agency action taken \nto implement or enforce the preventive care coverage \nrequirements in response to an \u2018A\u2019 or \u2018B\u2019 recommenda-\ntion by the  * * *  Task Force on or after March 23, \n2010.\u201d  Id. at 83a.  And the court also granted a nation-\nwide injunction barring the government from \u201cimple-\nmenting \nor \nenforcing\u201d \nthe \nACA\u2019s \npreventive- \nservices \u201ccoverage requirements in response to an \u2018A\u2019 \nor \u2018B\u2019 rating from the Task Force in the future.\u201d  Ibid. \n3.  The government sought a stay pending appeal of \nthe district court\u2019s universal remedies.  After the court \nof appeals heard oral argument on the government\u2019s \nstay motion, the parties stipulated to a stay of the uni-\nversal remedies, and the court of appeals entered a cor-\nresponding stay.  C.A. Doc. 153-2 (June 13, 2023).  While \nthe appeal was pending, the Secretary ratified the \nAHRQ Director\u2019s appointment of the current members \nof the Task Force and appointed those members himself \non a prospective basis.  See Secretary of HHS, Ratifica-\ntion of Prior Appointment and Prospective Appointment: \n\n10 \n \nAppointment Affidavits (June 28, 2023), https://perma.\ncc/8TAA-7AMN.    \n4. The court of appeals affirmed the district court\u2019s \nholding that the Task Force\u2019s structure violates the Ap-\npointments Clause but reversed the district court\u2019s \ngrant of universal relief.  App., infra, 1a-48a.    \na. The court of appeals held that Task Force mem-\nbers are principal officers who had not been properly \nappointed.  App., infra, 26a.  The court acknowledged \nthat \u201can officer\u2019s removability\u201d is \u201cperhaps the most im-\nportant\u201d \u201challmark[] of inferiority.\u201d  Id. at 17a.  And it \n\u201cagree[d] with the Government that the HHS Secretary \nmay remove members of the Task Force at will.\u201d  Id. at \n18a.  But the court believed that \u201canother important \nconsideration  * * *  is the extent to which the Task \nForce\u2019s work can be supervised by a higher-ranking ex-\necutive official, like Secretary Becerra.\u201d  Id. at 20a.  \n\u201cOn that front,\u201d the court of appeals reasoned that it \ncould not \u201csay that any such supervision exists\u2014as a \nmatter of law or reality.\u201d  App., infra, 20a.  Citing Sec-\ntion 299b-4(a)(6), the court took the view that \u201cthe Task \nForce cannot be \u2018independent\u2019 and free from \u2018political \npressure\u2019 on the one hand, and at the same time be su-\npervised by the HHS Secretary, a political appointee, \non the other.\u201d  Ibid.  The court construed \u201cindependent\u201d \nto mean \u201cfree[] from outside control,\u201d as opposed to \nsimply \u201cunbiased.\u201d  Id. at 21a n.59.  And the court de-\nclined to read Section 299b-4(a)(6)\u2019s phrase, \u201cto the ex-\ntent practicable,\u201d to give the Secretary a level of control \nnecessary to avoid any constitutional problem.  42 \nU.S.C. 299b-4(a)(6); see App., infra, 21a-23a. \nThe court of appeals then \u201cresolve[d] the competing \nconsiderations\u201d bearing on the status of Task Force \nmembers\u2014at-will removability coupled with allegedly \n\n11 \n \nunreviewable authority\u2014\u201cin favor of holding that the \nTask Force members are principal officers.\u201d  App., in-\nfra, 24a.  The court believed that this Court\u2019s decision \nin Arthrex was largely \u201cdispositive,\u201d because \u201c[l]ike the \n[Patent Trial and Appeal Board at issue in Arthrex], the \nTask Force can, and does, issue legally binding deci-\nsions without any review by a higher-ranking officer.\u201d  \nIbid.  \u201cIt is no answer,\u201d the court concluded, \u201cthat the \nHHS Secretary can exercise indirect control over the \nTask Force\u2019s recommendations through his removal \npower.\u201d  Id. at 25a. \nThe court of appeals also declined to sever Section \n299b-4(a)(6) and allow the Secretary to review Task \nForce \u201cA\u201d and \u201cB\u201d recommendations on that basis.  \nApp., infra, 30a-33a.  The court acknowledged that \u201c[i]f \n[it] were to \u2018sever\u2019 \u00a7 299b-4(a)(6),\u201d the Secretary\u2019s re-\nview of Task Force recommendations \u201cwould not con-\nflict with any other applicable statutory provision.\u201d  Id. \nat 31a.  But the court found it \u201cfar from clear\u201d how a \n\u201cdecision to disregard \u00a7 299b-4(a)(6) would also thereby \nempower the Secretary to begin reviewing, and possibly \nrejecting, the Task Force\u2019s recommendations.\u201d  Ibid. \n(footnote omitted).  The court further opined that the \nSecretary\u2019s authority over the Public Health Service \ndoes not extend to the Task Force because, in the \ncourt\u2019s view, the Task Force is \u201can[] advisory council, \nboard, or committee\u201d exempt from secretarial control.  \nId. at 31a-32a (quoting \u00a7 1(b), 80 Stat. 1610).  For those \nreasons, the court was \u201cunable to track the Supreme \nCourt\u2019s severability analysis in Arthrex,\u201d and concluded \nthat \u201cwith or without \u00a7 299b-4(a)(6), the constitutional \nproblem persists.\u201d  Id. at 32a-33a.  \n\n12 \n \nb. The court of appeals next held that there \u201cwas no \nbasis\u201d for the district court\u2019s grant of \u201cuniversal reme-\ndies.\u201d  App., infra, 34a.  The court observed that, \u201cnot-\nwithstanding notable skepticism\u201d about the availability \nof universal vacatur under the APA, the Fifth Circuit \n\u201chas understood vacatur under \u00a7 706(2) to be a remedy \nthat affects individuals beyond those who are parties to \nthe immediate dispute.\u201d  Id. at 34a-35a.  And the court \nstated that under Fifth Circuit precedent, universal va-\ncatur is \u201cthe \u2018default\u2019 remedy for unlawful agency ac-\ntion.\u201d  Id. at 36a (citation omitted).  Accordingly, the \ncourt found that the district court did not err by refus-\ning to consider \u201cthe various equities at stake before de-\ntermining\u201d that vacatur was warranted.  Ibid. \nThe court of appeals observed, however, that under \nFifth Circuit precedent, \u201cone of the minimal require-\nments to be entitled to th[e] \u2018default\u2019 APA remedy is, \nperhaps unsurprisingly, an APA claim.\u201d  App., infra, \n37a.  Because respondents had failed to plead an APA \nclaim in their operative complaint, the court rejected \nthe \u201cdistrict court\u2019s decision to vacate all agency actions \ntaken to enforce the Task Force\u2019s recommendations.\u201d  \nId. at 39a.  And \u201cwithout any basis to seek universal va-\ncatur,\u201d the court held that respondents correspondingly \n\u201clack any basis for an injunction of the same breadth.\u201d  \nId. at 42a-43a.  The court of appeals therefore limited \nthe district court\u2019s injunction so that it bars the govern-\nment only from enforcing the preventive-services cov-\nerage requirements against respondents.  Id. at 43a. \nREASONS FOR GRANTING THE PETITION \nThe court of appeals relied on an erroneous under-\nstanding of the Appointments Clause to hold the Task \nForce\u2019s structure unconstitutional.  The Secretary has \nthe power to remove Task Force members at will and to \n\n13 \n \nsupervise the Public Health Service, of which the Task \nForce is a part.  Under this Court\u2019s precedent, Task \nForce members are subordinate to the Secretary and \nserve as inferior officers.  Indeed, the court of appeals \nidentified no case in which an official who is removable \nat will by a principal officer is herself a principal officer.  \nAt minimum, the court of appeals should have severed \nthe lone provision that it (incorrectly) perceived as un-\nduly insulating the Task Force from secretarial control. \nThis Court\u2019s review is warranted because the court \nof appeals has held an Act of Congress unconstitutional \nand its legal rationale would inflict immense practical \nharms.  Millions of Americans rely on insurance cover-\nage for preventive services without cost sharing.  If al-\nlowed to stand, the decision below would call into ques-\ntion the legal duty of insurance issuers and group health \nplans to cover Task Force \u201cA\u201d and \u201cB\u201d recommenda-\ntions without cost sharing.  Moreover, the decision could \nprompt district courts within the Fifth Circuit to uni-\nversally vacate past agency actions implementing \u201cA\u201d \nand \u201cB\u201d recommendations and universally enjoin imple-\nmentation of those recommendations moving forward.  \nThe petition should be granted.      \nA. The Decision Below Is Incorrect \nThis Court\u2019s precedents chart a clear path for resolv-\ning the Appointments Clause challenge here:  Task \nForce members properly serve as inferior officers who \nare subordinate to the Secretary; and at minimum, the \nlone provision that respondents cite as unduly insulat-\ning Task Force members from secretarial control can \nbe construed or severed to cure any constitutional de-\nfect.  The court of appeals\u2019 contrary ruling lacks merit.     \n\n14 \n \n1. Task Force members properly serve as inferior offic-\ners who are subordinate to the Secretary   \nThe court of appeals held that Task Force members \nare principal officers who must be appointed by the \nPresident with the advice and consent of the Senate be-\ncause the Secretary lacks adequate supervisory author-\nity over them.  App., infra, 26a.  That holding is incor-\nrect.  \na. The Appointments Clause distinguishes between \n\u201cinferior Officers\u201d\u2014whose appointment Congress may \nvest \u201cin the President alone, in the Courts of Law, or in \nthe Heads of Departments,\u201d U.S. Const. Art. II, \u00a7 2, Cl. \n2\u2014and \u201cprincipal (noninferior) officers,\u201d who must be \nappointed by the President with the advice and consent \nof the Senate.  Edmond v. United States, 520 U.S. 651, \n659 (1997); see id. at 659-660.  \u201cGenerally speaking, the \nterm \u2018inferior officer\u2019 connotes a relationship with some \nhigher ranking officer or officers below the President,\u201d \nbecause \u201c[w]hether one is an \u2018inferior\u2019 officer depends \non whether he has a superior.\u201d  Id. at 662.  Thus, inferior \nofficers are \u201cofficers whose work is directed and super-\nvised at some level by others who were appointed by \nPresidential nomination with the advice and consent of \nthe Senate.\u201d  Id. at 663. \nIn determining whether adequate direction and su-\npervision exists, the Court has emphasized that \u201c[t]he \npower to remove officers  * * *  is a powerful tool for \ncontrol.\u201d  Edmond, 520 U.S. at 664.  After all, \u201c[o]nce an \nofficer is appointed it is only the authority that can re-\nmove him, and not the authority that appointed him, \nthat he must fear and, in the performance of his func-\ntions, obey.\u201d  Bowsher v. Synar, 478 U.S. 714, 726 (1986) \n(citation omitted).  As the D.C. Circuit has put the point, \n\u201c[w]ith unfettered removal power, [a principal officer] \n\n15 \n \nwill have the direct ability to \u2018direct,\u2019 \u2018supervise,\u2019 and \nexert some \u2018control\u2019 over [another officer\u2019s] decisions.\u201d  \nIntercollegiate Broad. Sys., Inc. v. Copyright Royalty \nBd., 684 F.3d 1332, 1341 (2012) (citation omitted), cert. \ndenied, 569 U.S. 1004 (2013). \nThis Court\u2019s cases have thus recognized that the un-\nrestricted removability of an officer by someone other \nthan the President is strong and likely dispositive evi-\ndence of inferior-officer status.  In Edmond, the Court \nheld that judges of the Coast Guard Court of Criminal \nAppeals were inferior officers in part because they \ncould be removed by the Judge Advocate General \u201cfrom \n[a] judicial assignment without cause.\u201d  520 U.S. at 664; \nsee Free Enter. Fund v. Public Co. Accounting Over-\nsight Bd., 537 F.3d 667, 707 (D.C. Cir. 2008) (Ka-\nvanaugh, J., dissenting) (noting that \u201cEdmond was a \nrelatively easy case\u201d because \u201c[t]he officers were re-\nmovable at will\u201d), aff\u2019d in part, rev\u2019d in part, and re-\nmanded 561 U.S. 477 (2010).  And in Free Enterprise \nFund v. Public Co. Accounting Oversight Board, 561 \nU.S. 477 (2010), the Court \u201cha[d] no hesitation in con-\ncluding\u201d that members of the Public Company Account-\ning Oversight Board were inferior officers once \u201cthe \nstatutory restrictions on the [Securities and Exchange] \nCommission\u2019s power to remove Board members\u201d had \nbeen severed.  Id. at 510.  That was true, the Court held, \neven though \u201cthe Board is empowered to take signifi-\ncant enforcement actions, and does so largely inde-\npendently of the Commission.\u201d  Id. at 504.  \nSimilarly, in his dissent in Morrison v. Olson, 487 \nU.S. 654 (1988), Justice Scalia explained that if the in-\ndependent counsel there had been \u201cremovable at will by \nthe Attorney General, then she would [have been] sub-\n\n16 \n \nordinate to him and thus properly designated as infe-\nrior.\u201d  Id. at 716.  But because the statute made her \u201cre-\nmovable only for \u2018good cause\u2019\u200a\u201d and otherwise limited \nthe Attorney General\u2019s oversight of her responsibilities, \nJustice Scalia reasoned that \u201cshe is not subordinate.\u201d  \nIbid. (citation omitted).  Likewise, in a dissent in Free \nEnterprise Fund, which anticipated this Court\u2019s subse-\nquent majority opinion, then-Judge Kavanaugh ex-\nplained that \u201cEdmond and the basic principles underly-\ning Article II teach that the key initial question in  \ndetermining whether an executive officer is inferior  \nis whether the officer is removable at will\u201d because \n\u201c[r]emovability at will carries with it the inherent power \nto direct and supervise.\u201d  537 F.3d at 707.  He concluded \nthat \u201cremovable-at-will officers in the executive depart-\nments and agencies ultimately report not only to the \nPresident, but also to other superior officers in the Ex-\necutive Branch chain of command\u201d and therefore \u201cmay \nproperly be considered inferior officers.\u201d  Id. at 707 \nn.15. \nCongress has long established important federal of-\nfices with substantial discretion and authority that have \nbeen understood to be inferior offices because their oc-\ncupants may be removed at will by a principal officer.  \nThe Benefits Review Board in the Department of Labor \nissues final benefits-related orders that are not subject \nto further review by any Executive Branch officer.  See \n33 U.S.C. 921(b) and (c); Pittson Coal Grp. v. Sebben, \n488 U.S. 105, 112 (1988).  Yet in United States v. Ar-\nthrex, Inc., 594 U.S. 1 (2021), this Court found Benefits \nReview Board members \u201cpotentially distinguishable\u201d \nfrom the unconstitutionally appointed administrative \npatent judges there because Benefits Review Board \n\n17 \n \nmembers \u201cappear to serve at the pleasure of the ap-\npointing department head.\u201d  Id. at 20-21.  Similarly, the \nFederal Open Market Committee has final authority \nover decisions to contract or expand the supply of \nmoney in the United States, see 12 U.S.C. 263, and yet \nits members are inferior officers because the Federal \nReserve Board of Governors \u201chas the authority to re-\nmove them at will,\u201d Appointment and Removal of Fed-\neral Reserve Bank Members of the Federal Open Mar-\nket Committee, 2019 WL 11594453, at *7 (Op. O.L.C. \nOct. 23, 2019).  And the Postmaster General is \u201c[t]he \nchief executive officer of the Postal Service,\u201d 39 U.S.C. \n203, and yet is an inferior officer under the Appoint-\nments Clause because he \u201cserv[es] at the pleasure of \nthe\u201d Postal Service\u2019s Board of Governors, Silver v. \nUnited States Postal Serv., 951 F.2d 1033, 1040 (9th Cir. \n1991) (per curiam); see The Constitutional Separation \nof Powers Between the President and Congress, 20 Op. \nO.L.C. 124, 150 (1996).       \nb. Applying those principles here, Task Force mem-\nbers are inferior officers.  As both the court of appeals \nand district court recognized, \u201cthe HHS Secretary may \nremove members of the Task Force at will.\u201d  App., in-\nfra, 18a; see id. at 119a.  After all, the Secretary may \nappoint Task Force members when \u201cacting through the \nDirector\u201d of AHRQ, 42 U.S.C. 299(a), who normally con-\nvenes the Task Force, 42 U.S.C. 299b-4(a)(1).  See also \n\u00a7\u00a7 1(a), 2, 80 Stat. 1610.  And \u201cthe power of removal of \nexecutive officers [i]s incident to the power of appoint-\nment.\u201d  Myers v. United States, 272 U.S. 52, 119 (1926); \nsee Free Enter. Fund, 561 U.S. at 509.  Nor is there any \nstatutory text protecting Task Force members from re-\nmoval.  Cf. Collins v. Yellen, 594 U.S. 220, 248 (2021) \n(\u201cWhen a statute does not limit the President\u2019s power \n\n18 \n \nto remove an agency head, we generally presume that \nthe officer serves at the President\u2019s pleasure.\u201d).  Thus, \nbecause the Secretary (a principal officer) has \u201cthe \npower to remove [Task Force] members at will,\u201d the \nCourt should \u201chave no hesitation in concluding\u201d that \nthose members are inferior officers serving under the \nSecretary\u2019s direction.  Free Enter. Fund, 561 U.S. at \n510.  \nIf further indicia of secretarial \u201coversight authority\u201d \nwere required to render Task Force members inferior \nofficers, Free Enter. Fund, 561 U.S. at 510, the relevant \nlaws here provide it.  As noted above, Congress has em-\npowered the Secretary to \u201csupervis[e] and direct[]\u201d the \nPublic Health Service, 42 U.S.C. 202, which includes the \nTask Force.  The Secretary is also permitted to perform \n\u201call functions of the Public Health Service\u201d and its \u201cof-\nficers,\u201d \u201cemployees,\u201d and \u201cagencies,\u201d and to \u201cmake such \nprovisions as he shall deem appropriate authorizing the \nperformance of any of the functions  * * *  of the Public \nHealth Service.\u201d  \u00a7\u00a7 1(a), 2, 80 Stat. 1610.  And Congress \ngave the Secretary the more specific authority to \u201ces-\ntablish a minimum interval\u201d before which issuers and \nplans must cover a Task Force \u201cA\u201d or \u201cB\u201d recommen-\ndation without cost sharing.  42 U.S.C. 300gg-13(b)(1).  \nThe \nsum \ntotal \nof \nthose \nsecretarial \noversight  \nauthorities\u2014especially in conjunction with unfettered \nremoval power\u2014ensure that the Task Force can be \u201cdi-\nrected and supervised at some level by [another officer] \nwho w[as] appointed by Presidential nomination with \nthe advice and consent of the Senate.\u201d  Edmond, 520 \nU.S. at 663.   \nc. The court of appeals erred in holding otherwise.  \nThe court acknowledged that \u201can officer\u2019s removability\u201d \nis \u201cthe most important\u201d \u201challmark[] of inferiority.\u201d  \n\n19 \n \nApp., infra, 17a.  And it \u201cagree[d] with the Government \nthat the HHS Secretary may remove members of the \nTask Force at will.\u201d  Id. at 18a.  But the court nonethe-\nless found insufficient secretarial \u201csupervision\u201d of Task \nForce recommendations.  Id. at 20a.  The court was mis-\ntaken. \nAs an initial matter, the court of appeals identified \nno authority for the proposition that at-will removal is a \nconstitutionally insufficient method through which a \nprincipal officer may supervise an inferior officer.  In-\ndeed, neither the court of appeals nor respondents have \nidentified any case in which an official who was remov-\nable at will by a principal officer was herself a principal \nofficer.  This Court should reject that unprecedented \nand illogical outcome.         \nThe court of appeals also misunderstood Section \n299b-4(a)(6).  As noted above, Section 299b-4(a)(6) pro-\nvides that Task Force members and their recommenda-\ntions \u201cshall be independent and, to the extent practica-\nble, not subject to political pressure.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 299b-\n4(a)(6).  That provision helps ensure that Task Force \nmembers exercise their own best judgment, not regard \nthemselves as mere representatives of the organiza-\ntions or professions in which they serve, and not be in-\nfluenced by outside pressures.  See D. Ct. Doc. 65, at 72 \n(explaining the steps the Task Force takes to ensure \npublic \u201cconfidence in the integrity of the process by \nwhich [it] makes its recommendations\u201d).         \nTo the extent Section 299b-4(a)(6) is also understood \nto address the relationship of the Task Force to HHS, \nit does not support the court of appeals\u2019 holding here. \nAgainst the backdrop of the Secretary\u2019s broad authority \nover the Public Health Service, the reference to \u201cinde-\npendence\u201d is most naturally read to require the Task \n\n20 \n \nForce members to make \u201cunbiased, independent judg-\nments,\u201d even while subject to secretarial supervision \nwith respect to their conduct and the effect of their rec-\nommendations.  Kalaris v. Donovan, 697 F.2d 376, 394 \n(D.C. Cir.), cert. denied, 462 U.S. 1119 (1983).  Indeed, \nadministrative law judges and immigration judges are ex-\npected to issue decisions based on their own \u201cindepend-\nent judgment,\u201d Butz v. Economou, 438 U.S. 478, 513 \n(1978); see United States ex rel. Accardi v. Shaugh-\nnessy, 347 U.S. 260, 266-267 (1954), but both sets of of-\nficials still properly serve as inferior\u2014not principal\u2014\nofficers.  See Freytag v. Commissioner, 501 U.S. 868, \n882 (1991) (holding that special trial judges of the Tax \nCourt were inferior officers, even though they exercised \nindependent adjudicatory authority).   \nThe court of appeals dismissed this reading of \u201cinde-\npendent\u201d because of \u201cits juxtaposition to the additional \nrequirement that the Task Force not be \u2018subject to po-\nlitical pressure.\u2019\u200a\u201d  App., infra, 21a n.59.  But if both re-\nquirements simply \u201cconnote[] freedom from outside \ncontrol,\u201d as the court posited, ibid., then they would be \nredundant\u2014a result this Court normally seeks to avoid.  \nSee, e.g., Ysleta del Sur Pueblo v. Texas, 596 U.S. 685, \n698-699 (2022).  To give \u201ceffect\u201d to both terms so that \nneither is \u201csuperfluous\u201d or \u201cinsignificant,\u201d ibid. (cita-\ntion omitted), the term \u201cindependent\u201d is best read to \nclarify that the Task Force should bring to bear its ex-\npert, unbiased medical judgment. \nSimilarly, while Task Force recommendations may \nnot be \u201csubject to political pressure,\u201d the statute explic-\nitly qualifies that requirement with the phrase \u201cto the \nextent practicable.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 299b-4(a)(6).  If greater \nsecretarial supervision over Task Force recommenda-\ntions is constitutionally necessary, as the Fifth Circuit \n\n21 \n \nbelieved, then the phrase \u201cto the extent practicable\u201d can \nbe readily interpreted to allow it.  This Court construes \nstatutes to \u201cavoid\u201d rendering them \u201cunconstitutional\u201d if \n\u201cthere is another reasonable interpretation available.\u201d  \nEdmond, 520 U.S. at 658.  Here, Congress plainly in-\ntended to allow a saving construction, if necessary, by \nqualifying the limitation on political pressure with the \nflexible phrase \u201cto the extent practicable.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \n299b-4(a)(6). \nThe court of appeals declined to adopt that construc-\ntion because the court thought it would raise a \u201cline-\ndrawing problem\u201d in determining which Task Force \nrecommendations would be subject to secretarial re-\nview.  App., infra, 22a.  That is wrong.  Any constitu-\ntionally necessary supervision would be of Task Force \n\u201cA\u201d and \u201cB\u201d recommendations alone because only those \nrecommendations have binding effects on private par-\nties.  See 42 U.S.C. 300gg-13(a)(1).  Accordingly, only \nthose recommendations involve the exercise of \u201csignifi-\ncant authority pursuant to the laws of the United \nStates\u201d that makes Task Force members federal offic-\ners in the first place.  Arthrex, 594 U.S. at 13 (quoting \nBuckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1, 126 (1976) (per curiam)).  \nThe Task Force\u2019s nonbinding activities and recommen-\ndations (like its \u201cC\u201d recommendations and provision of \ntechnical assistance to medical professionals) would re-\nquire no additional secretarial supervision, because \nthose actions involve no significant exercise of federal \npower.  See id. at 14 (evaluating supervision only of the \npowers \u201cthat make[] the [administrative patent judges] \nofficers exercising \u2018significant authority\u2019 in the first \nplace\u201d) (citation omitted).   \nThe court of appeals also suggested that the govern-\nment\u2019s reading of Section 299b-4(a)(6) is \u201cinconsistent\u201d \n\n22 \n \nwith Section 300gg-13(b)(1), which requires the Secre-\ntary to establish a minimum interval before Task Force \n\u201cA\u201d and \u201cB\u201d recommendations bind issuers and group \nhealth plans.  App., infra, 23a.  But the specific power \nto establish such an interval does not conflict with the \nSecretary\u2019s general supervisory power to review and \nreject recommendations.  Instead, it simply gives the \nSecretary the further option of accepting a recommen-\ndation while delaying its effective date.           \nFinally, the court of appeals erred in viewing Ar-\nthrex as largely \u201cdispositive\u201d of the inferior-officer \nquestion here.  App., infra, 24a.  As an initial matter, \nthe Court in Arthrex made clear that its decision did \n\u201cnot address supervision outside the context of adjudi-\ncation,\u201d 594 U.S. at 23, which is not at issue here.  But \nmore fundamentally, the court of appeals overlooked \nthe key distinction between Arthrex and this case:  \nwhereas the administrative patent judges in Arthrex \nwere removable by the agency head only \u201cfor such cause \nas will promote the efficiency of the service,\u201d id. at 26 \n(quoting 5 U.S.C. 7513(a)), the Task Force members \nhere are removable by the Secretary at will.  Indeed, in \ndescribing the constitutional violation in Arthrex, the \nCourt specifically emphasized that Congress had \u201cinsu-\nlat[ed]\u201d the administrative patent judges\u2019 \u201coffices from \nremoval.\u201d  Id. at 23.  Accordingly, Arthrex only rein-\nforces that an official\u2019s at-will removability is critical to \nthe inferior-officer analysis.     \n2. Even if Task Force members were principal officers, \nSection 299b-4(a)(6) can be severed to cure the con-\nstitutional defect \nEven if this Court were to conclude that Task Force \nmembers are unconstitutionally insulated from secre-\ntarial supervision, this Court\u2019s precedent teaches that \n\n23 \n \nthe proper course is to sever the provision creating such \ninsulation.  The court of appeals erred in declining to do \nso.    \n\u201c\u200a\u2018Generally speaking, when confronting a constitu-\ntional flaw in a statute, [the Court] tr[ies] to limit the \nsolution to the problem,\u2019 severing any \u2018problematic por-\ntions while leaving the remainder intact.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Free Enter. \nFund, 561 U.S. at 508 (citation omitted).  And \u201c[b]ecause \n\u2018[t]he unconstitutionality of a part of an Act does not \nnecessarily defeat or affect the validity of its remaining \nprovisions,\u2019 the \u2018normal rule\u2019 is that \u2018partial, rather than \nfacial, invalidation is the required course.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Ibid. (cita-\ntions omitted; second set of brackets in original).    \nIn Arthrex, for instance, after concluding that ad-\nministrative patent judges\u2019 \u201cunreviewable authority\u201d \nwas \u201cincompatible with their appointment by the Secre-\ntary [of Commerce] to an inferior office,\u201d 594 U.S. at 23, \nthe Court determined that the statute \u201ccannot constitu-\ntionally be enforced to the extent that its requirements \nprevent the [Patent and Trademark Office] Director \nfrom reviewing final decisions rendered by\u201d the admin-\nistrative patent judges, id. at 25.4  The Court thus \n\u201csever[ed]\u201d the provision \u201cshielding\u201d the judges\u2019 deci-\nsions \u201cfrom review\u201d by the Director.  Id. at 24.  And \nwithout that provision, the Court reasoned that \u201cthe Di-\nrector has the authority to provide for a means of re-\nviewing\u201d the relevant decisions \u201c[b]ecause Congress \nhas vested the Director with the \u2018power and duties\u2019 of \n \n4 The severability portion of the Chief Justice\u2019s opinion was joined \nby Justices Alito, Kavanaugh, and Barrett.  Arthrex, 594 U.S. at 4.  \nJustice Breyer issued a concurrence in part and dissent in part, \njoined by Justices Sotomayor and Kagan, in which he \u201cagree[d] with \n[the] remedial holding\u201d of the Chief Justice\u2019s opinion.  Id. at 44.  \nThus, seven Justices concurred in the severability analysis.    \n\n24 \n \nthe [Patent and Trademark Office].\u201d  Id. at 25 (citation \nomitted).  Accordingly, the Court held that, following \nseverance, the Director \u201cmay review\u201d administrative \npatent judges\u2019 decisions and that the statute \u201cotherwise \nremains operative.\u201d  Ibid. \nThe same basic logic applies here.  The constitutional \ndefect perceived by the court of appeals was the ab-\nsence of a \u201csupervisory role for the Secretary\u201d over \u201cthe \nTask Force\u2019s recommendations\u201d; and in the court\u2019s \nview, that defect stemmed from Section 299b-4(a)(6)\u2019s \nrequirement that recommendations \u201cbe \u2018independent\u2019 \nand free from \u2018political pressure.\u2019\u200a\u201d  App., infra, 20a, \n23a.  The court therefore should have severed Section \n299b-4(a)(6)\u2019s application to Task Force \u201cA\u201d and \u201cB\u201d \nrecommendations, thus giving the Secretary \u201cauthority \nto provide for a means of reviewing\u201d those recommen-\ndations.  Arthrex, 594 U.S. at 25.  And the court should \nhave left the statute otherwise \u201coperative,\u201d ibid.\u2014 \nparticularly because \u201cnothing in the statute\u2019s text or \nhistorical context makes it \u2018evident\u2019 that Congress, \nfaced with the limitations imposed by the Constitution, \nwould have preferred\u201d a Task Force that cannot issue \nbinding preventive-services recommendations as op-\nposed to \u201ca [Task Force] whose members are\u201d super-\nvised by the Secretary, Free Enter. Fund, 561 U.S. at \n509 (citation omitted).     \nThe court of appeals \u201cagree[d] with the Government\u201d \nthat severing Section 299b-4(a)(6) would ensure secre-\ntarial supervision of the Task Force.  App., infra, 31a.  \nBut the court found that a \u201cdecision to disregard \u00a7 299b-\n4(a)(6)\u201d would not \u201calso thereby empower the Secretary \nto begin reviewing, and possibly rejecting, the Task \nForce\u2019s recommendations.\u201d  Ibid.  (footnote omitted).  \nAlthough the court recognized that \u201c[s]uch secretarial \n\n25 \n \nreview would not conflict with any other applicable stat-\nutory provision,\u201d the court saw no affirmative \u201cpower to \nreview the recommendations.\u201d  Ibid. \nThat reasoning conflicts with Arthrex.  There, the \nCourt held that after severing the problematic provi-\nsion, the Patent and Trademark Office Director \u201cha[d] \nthe authority to provide for a means of reviewing\u201d the \nrelevant decisions.  Arthrex, 594 U.S. at 25.  In so doing, \nthe Court relied on a general provision \u201cvest[ing] the \nDirector with the \u2018power and duties\u2019 of the [Patent and \nTrademark Office]\u201d and emphasized that \u201c[a] single of-\nficer has\u201d long \u201csuperintended the activities of\u201d that of-\nfice.  Id. at 24 (citation omitted).  Likewise here, the Sec-\nretary has the power to \u201csupervis[e] and direct[]\u201d the \nPublic Health Service, 42 U.S.C. 202, as well as the \npower to perform \u201call functions of the Public Health \nService\u201d and its \u201cofficers\u201d and \u201cagencies,\u201d \u00a7 1(a), 80 \nStat. 1610.  And the Secretary has superintended the \nPublic Health Service\u2019s activities since 1966.  See 80 \nStat. 1610.  Under Arthrex, the Secretary\u2019s longstand-\ning background authority to supervise and perform the \nPublic Health Service\u2019s functions would amply provide \nfor secretarial review of Task Force \u201cA\u201d and \u201cB\u201d rec-\nommendations following the severance of Section 299b-\n4(a)(6).   \nThe court of appeals\u2019 error stemmed in part from a \nfundamental misconception of the Reorganization Plan, \n80 Stat. 1610.  As noted above, the Reorganization Plan \nallows the Secretary to exercise power over \u201call func-\ntions of the Public Health Service,\u201d but it creates an ex-\nception for \u201cthe functions vested by law in any advisory \ncouncil, board, or committee of or in the Public Health \nService.\u201d  \u00a7 1, 80 Stat. 1610.  The court believed that the \n\n26 \n \nexception applies to the Task Force and that the Secre-\ntary therefore lacks power over the Task Force.  App., \ninfra, 31a-32a.  The court was incorrect.  \nThe exception for \u201cany advisory council, board, or \ncommittee\u201d does not apply to the Task Force.  \u00a7 1(b), 80 \nStat. 1610.  Instead, the exception applies to federal ad-\nvisory committees or councils that have purely recom-\nmendatory duties, like the Surgeon General\u2019s advisory \ncommittee that issued a landmark report on the health \neffects of smoking just two years before the Reorgani-\nzation Plan\u2019s adoption.  See Public Health Serv., U.S. \nDep\u2019t of Health, Educ., and Welfare, Smoking and \nHealth:  Report of the Advisory Committee to the Sur-\ngeon General of the Public Health Serv. (1964), \nhttps://perma.cc/8YPT-M9MB.  Indeed, the Federal \nAdvisory Committee Act (FACA), Pub. L. No. 92-463, \n86 Stat. 770 (1972), enacted shortly after the HHS Re-\norganization Plan, uses the same basic terminology, re-\nferring to \u201ccommittees, boards, commissions, councils, \nand similar groups which have been established to ad-\nvise officers and agencies in the executive branch.\u201d  \n\u00a7 2(a), 86 Stat. 770; see 5 U.S.C. 1002(a) (Supp. IV 2022).  \nAnd FACA makes clear that \u201cthe function of advisory \ncommittees should be advisory only.\u201d  \u00a7 2(b)(6), 86 Stat. \n770; see 5 U.S.C. 1002(b)(6) (Supp. IV 2022). \nThe Task Force is not an advisory body covered by \nthe Reorganization Plan\u2019s exception.  Congress ex-\npressly provided that the Task Force is not subject to \nFACA.  42 U.S.C. 299b-4(a)(5) (Supp. IV 2022) (\u201c[T]he \nTask Force is not subject to the provisions of chapter 10 \nof Title 5.\u201d).  And Task Force \u201cA\u201d and \u201cB\u201d recommen-\ndations are not merely advisory but instead may bind \nprivate insurance issuers and group health plans.  42 \nU.S.C. 300gg-13(a)(1).  The court of appeals offered no \n\n27 \n \nreason why Congress would create a body within the \nPublic Health Service whose decisions would bind the \npublic at large, and then choose not to grant the Secre-\ntary authority to oversee that body\u2014even though the \nSecretary is vested with all other authority in the Public \nHealth Service.  The more natural reading is that Con-\ngress authorized the Secretary to oversee the Task \nForce, just as the Secretary oversees the other compo-\nnents of the Public Health Service that exercise signifi-\ncant federal power.   \nB. The Decision Below Warrants Review \nThis Court should grant the petition for a writ of cer-\ntiorari because the Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision declares the \nTask Force\u2019s structure unconstitutional and threatens \nenormous legal and practical consequences.  \n1. The Court\u2019s intervention is necessary because the \ncourt of appeals held that \u201cconstitutional problems  \n* * *  inhere in the Task Force\u2019s\u201d structure.  App., infra, \n30a.  The Court has recognized that judging the consti-\ntutionality of an Act of Congress is \u201cthe gravest and \nmost delicate duty\u201d of the Federal Judiciary.  Rostker \nv. Goldberg, 453 U.S. 57, 64 (1981) (citation omitted).  \nAccordingly, \u201cwhen a lower court has invalidated a fed-\neral statute,\u201d the Court\u2019s \u201cusual\u201d approach is to grant \ncertiorari.  Iancu v. Brunetti, 588 U.S. 388, 392 (2019).  \nIndeed, the Court applies a \u201cstrong presumption in fa-\nvor of granting writs of certiorari to review decisions of \nlower courts holding federal statutes unconstitutional.\u201d  \nMaricopa Cnty. v. Lopez-Valenzuela, 574 U.S. 1006, \n1007 (2014) (statement of Thomas, J., respecting the  \ndenial of the application for a stay).  And the Court  \nhas repeatedly reviewed such decisions even in the  \nabsence of a circuit conflict.  See, e.g., SEC v. Jarkesy, \n144 S. Ct. 2117, 2127 (2024); Haaland v. Brackeen, 599 \n\n28 \n \nU.S. 255, 272 (2023); United States v. Vaello Madero, \n596 U.S. 159, 164 (2022); Arthrex, 594 U.S. at 11; Barr \nv. American Ass\u2019n of Political Consultants, Inc., 591 \nU.S. 610, 618 (2020) (plurality opinion); United States v. \nSineneng-Smith, 590 U.S. 371, 375 (2020). That course \nis especially warranted here because the court of ap-\npeals\u2019 decision is in serious tension with this Court\u2019s \nprecedent and decisions of other courts of appeals re-\njecting similar Appointments Clause challenges in \nother contexts.  See pp. 14-22, supra; Intercollegiate \nBroad. Sys., 684 F.3d at 1340-1341.   \n2. This Court\u2019s review is also warranted because of \nthe immense legal and practical significance of the court \nof appeals\u2019 decision.  That decision holds that the Task \nForce has been unlawfully exercising governmental au-\nthority for the past 14 years.  And the decision threat-\nens to disrupt a key part of the ACA that provides \nhealthcare protections for millions of Americans.   \na. Even before the ACA\u2019s enactment, the medical \ncommunity had recognized that increased use of pre-\nventive services would save more than 100,000 lives and \nbillions of dollars each year.  See American Lung Ass\u2019n \nC.A. Amici Br. 13-14 (citing studies).  And yet health in-\nsurance issuers and group health plans \u201chad little incen-\ntive to cover preventive services, the benefits of which \nmay only be realized in the future.\u201d  D. Ct. Doc. 121-2, \nat 3 (Apr. 12, 2023).  Because of that lack of coverage, \nAmericans used preventive services at only about half \nthe recommended rate.  See Centers for Medicare & \nMedicaid Servs., HHS, Background: The Affordable \nCare Act\u2019s New Rules on Preventive Care (July 14, \n2010), https://perma.cc/U8K5-MN95.    \n\n29 \n \nIn the ACA, Congress sought to save lives, improve \npublic health, and reduce healthcare spending by ensur-\ning that Americans could receive preventive services \nwithout co-pays or other cost-sharing mechanisms.  See \n42 U.S.C. 300gg-13.  As one Senator explained, \u201cif you \ncan detect a disease early, you can not only save lives, \nbut you can save health care costs because the preven-\ntive services only cost a couple hundred dollars, and an \noperation you can avoid is tens of thousands of dollars.\u201d  \n155 Cong. Rec. 33,071 (2009) (statement of Sen. Cardin).  \nCongress ultimately devoted an entire title of the Act to \n\u201cPrevention of Chronic Disease and Improving Public \nHealth.\u201d  Tit. IV, 124 Stat. 538 (capitalization altered).   \nCongress\u2019s reform has proved effective.  See Ameri-\ncan Pub. Health Ass\u2019n C.A. Amici Br. 15-19.  A review \nof numerous medical studies found that eliminating cost \nsharing has led to increased use of many preventive ser-\nvices, particularly among individuals with lower in-\ncomes.  Id. at 15-16.  In 2018, approximately 100 million \nAmericans\u20146 in 10 privately insured people\u2014received \npreventive services (including those recommended by \nthe Task Force) that were covered without cost sharing \nunder the ACA.  American Lung Ass\u2019n C.A. Amici Br. \n16.  Thus, millions of Americans with private insurance \nnow have access to preventive services without cost \nsharing.  See Access to Preventive Services 1; D. Ct. \nDoc. 121-1, at 2.  And substantial evidence suggests \n\u201cthat ready access to preventive services without cost-\nsharing\u201d has \u201cimprove[d] health outcomes\u201d and \u201cre-\nduces the costs of health care delivery for all stakehold-\ners.\u201d  Blue Cross Blue Shield Ass\u2019n C.A. Amicus Br. 10-\n11; see American Hosp. Ass\u2019n C.A. Amicus Br. 15. \nb. The decision below jeopardizes the availability of \nthis critical care.  Under the logic of that decision, no \n\n30 \n \none\u2014not the Task Force or even the Secretary\u2014can is-\nsue preventive-services recommendations that issuers \nand plans must cover under Section 300gg-13(a)(1).  If \nthat logic were accepted, then the list of covered pre-\nventive services would no longer include the most up-\ndated \u201cclinical preventive recommendations.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \n299b-4(a)(1).  That result would run squarely counter to \nCongress\u2019s goal of ensuring \u201ca healthier population\u201d \nand \u201creduc[ing] health care costs by helping individuals \navoid preventable conditions and receive treatment ear-\nlier.\u201d  78 Fed. Reg. at 39,872. \nAbsent this Court\u2019s intervention, even more damag-\ning consequences could imminently follow.  As noted \nabove, the district court granted universal relief, vacat-\ning \u201c[a]ll agency action taken to implement or enforce\u201d \nthe Task Force\u2019s \u201cA\u201d and \u201cB\u201d recommendations since \nMarch 23, 2010, and enjoining the government from \n\u201cimplementing or enforcing  * * *  coverage require-\nments in response to an \u2018A\u2019 or \u2018B\u2019 rating from the Task \nForce in the future.\u201d  App., infra, 83a (citation omitted).  \nThe court of appeals reversed that universal remedy \nonly on the ground that respondents had failed to assert \nan APA claim in their operative complaint.  Id. at 37a, \n42a-43a.  But in so doing, the court emphasized that un-\nder Fifth Circuit precedent, universal vacatur is \u201cthe \n\u2018default\u2019 remedy for unlawful agency action,\u201d and courts \nneed not consider \u201cthe various equities at stake before \ndetermining whether a party is entitled to vacatur.\u201d  Id. \nat 36a (citation omitted).  Thus, unless this Court grants \nreview, a future plaintiff with Article III standing could \nbring an APA claim in a district court within the Fifth \nCircuit, challenge the Task Force\u2019s recommendations \n\n31 \n \non Appointments Clause grounds, and obtain a sweep-\ning remedy that would render the Task Force preven-\ntive-services scheme inoperative nationwide.  \nSuch a remedy would upend healthcare coverage for \nmillions of Americans.  Under that remedy, issuers and \ngroup health plans could eliminate coverage (or impose \ncost-sharing requirements) for any preventive services \nrecommended by the Task Force since March 23, 2010.  \nThat would include, for example: \n\u2022 \nStatins for cardiovascular disease and stroke: \nThe Task Force has recommended the use of \nstatins (medication that reduces cholesterol) to \nprevent heart disease and stroke for at-risk \nadults between the ages of 40-75.  See A&B Rec-\nommendations, supra.  Heart disease is the \ncountry\u2019s leading cause of death, and statin use \nsignificantly reduces the probability of heart at-\ntacks and strokes.  D. Ct. Doc. 121-1, at 7.  In \nturn, \u201c[l]ower copayments for statin medications \nhave been associated with higher levels of adher-\nence.\u201d  Ibid.  \n\u2022 \nLung cancer screenings: The Task Force has \nrecommended annual lung cancer screenings for \nat-risk adults between the ages of 50-80.  See \nA&B Recommendations, supra.  When lung can-\ncer is caught at an early stage, the five-year sur-\nvival rate is 61%; but when it is caught at a late \nstage, that rate is just 7%.  D. Ct. Doc. 121-1, at \n6.  The ACA\u2019s requirement of coverage for lung \ncancer screenings without cost sharing is esti-\nmated to save approximately 10,000-20,000 lives \nper year.  Ibid.  \n\n32 \n \n\u2022 \nDiabetes screening: The Task Force has recom-\nmended that certain at-risk adults receive \nscreening for prediabetes and type-2 diabetes.  \nSee A&B Recommendations, supra.  Type-2 di-\nabetes is preventable and its progression can be \ndelayed.  United States of Care C.A. Amici Br. \n22.  Yet approximately $1 out of every $4 in \nAmerican healthcare costs is spent on caring for \npeople with diabetes, resulting in $307 billion in \ndirect medical costs annually.  Centers for Dis-\nease Control & Prevention, HHS, Health and \nEconomic Benefits of Diabetes Interventions \n(May 15, 2024), https://perma.cc/YW5F-KLX4.  \nUnder the district court\u2019s reasoning and remedy \nin this case, insurers would no longer be required \nto provide cost-free coverage for many prediabe-\ntes screenings and interventions.       \nThe preventive services just mentioned represent \nonly a fraction of the services that would be jeopardized \nby a universal remedy.  Other affected services include \ncervical and colorectal cancer screenings; hepatitis B \nand C screenings; physical therapy for older adults to \nprevent falls; ointments to prevent blindness in new-\nborns; and nutritional supplements to support healthy \npregnancies.  See A&B Recommendations, supra; \nAmerican Pub. Health Ass\u2019n C.A. Amici Br. 8-14 (docu-\nmenting these and other services).  \nIf all post-2010 Task Force \u201cA\u201d and \u201cB\u201d recommen-\ndations became nonbinding nationwide, a material num-\nber of issuers and group health plans would be expected \nto \u201cdrop coverage or impose cost sharing for certain \npreventive services.\u201d  D. Ct. Doc. 121-1, at 3; see Blue \nCross Blue Shield Ass\u2019n C.A. Amicus Br. 14-15.  That \nexpectation accords with pre-ACA experience, as many \n\n33 \n \nissuers and plans did not then cover preventive services \nwithout cost sharing.  See D. Ct. Doc. 121-2, at 3-4.  And \nthe expectation also accords with experience under the \nACA, as many issuers and plans have not covered pre-\nventive services without cost sharing until the statute \nhas required them to do so following a Task Force \u201cA\u201d \nor \u201cB\u201d recommendation.  See ibid.   \nA recent survey suggests that if issuers and group \nhealth plans did impose cost-sharing requirements for \npreventive services, 40% of Americans would be unable \nor unwilling to pay out of pocket for those services.  See \nD. Ct. Doc. 121-1, at 4.  That survey is consistent with \nsubstantial literature suggesting that \u201cthe presence of \ncost-sharing, even if the amount is relatively modest, \ndeters patients from receiving care.\u201d  American Pub. \nHealth Ass\u2019n C.A. Amici Br. 17 (citation omitted).  In \nturn, decreased use of preventive services would create \n\u201ca sicker population\u201d and \u201chigher overall health care \ncosts,\u201d D. Ct.

WILLETT, Circuit Judge: \n\n2a \n \nThe Affordable Care Act requires private insurers to \ncover certain kinds of \u201cpreventive care,\u201d including con-\ntraception, HPV vaccines, and drugs preventing the \ntransmission of HIV.  The plaintiffs are a group of in-\ndividuals and businesses who have religious objections \nto these preventive-care mandates and challenged them \non multiple grounds.  They contend, among other things, \nthat the preventive-care mandates are unlawful because \nthe agencies that issued them violate Article II of the \nConstitution, insofar as their members are principal of-\nficers of the United States who have not been validly ap-\npointed under the Appointments Clause.  In a series of \nsummary-judgment rulings, the district court mostly \nagreed, vacating all agency actions taken to enforce the \nmandates under the Administrative Procedure Act and \nissuing both party-specific and universal injunctive re-\nlief. \nOur decision today is something of a mixed bag.  \nWith respect to one of the challenged administrative \nbodies, the United States Preventive Services Task Force, \nwe agree that the unreviewable power it wields\u2014the \npower to issue preventive-care recommendations that \ninsurers must cover by law\u2014renders its members prin-\ncipal officers of the United States who have not been val-\nidly appointed under Article II of the United States \nConstitution.  And because Xavier Becerra, in his ca-\npacity as the Secretary of the Department of Health and \nHuman Services, has not validly cured the Task Force\u2019s \nconstitutional problems, the district court properly en-\njoined the defendants from enforcing the preventive-\ncare mandates to the extent they came at the recommen-\ndation of the Task Force.  We think it was error, how-\never, for the district court to have also vacated all \nagency actions taken to enforce the preventive-care \n\n3a \n \nmandates and to universally enjoin the defendants from \nenforcing them. \nWith respect to the plaintiffs\u2019 cross-appeal and their \nAppointments Clause challenges against the other two \nadministrative bodies at issue in this case, the Advisory \nCommittee on Immunization Practices and the Health \nResources and Services Administration, we agree with \nthe Government that Secretary Becerra has the author-\nity to ratify their recommendations and guidelines, but \nwe reserve judgment on whether he has effectively done \nso.  The district court had no opportunity to consider \nthe plaintiffs\u2019 arguments that the Secretary\u2019s ratifica-\ntion memo suffers from multiple defects under the Ad-\nministrative Procedure Act, and we decline to consider \nthese arguments in the first instance. \nAccordingly, we AFFIRM in part, REVERSE in \npart, and REMAND for further proceedings consistent \nwith this opinion. \nI \nA \nIn 2010, Congress passed, and President Obama \nsigned into law, the Patient Protection and Affordable \nCare Act (ACA).1  As part of its stated goal of broaden-\ning health insurance coverage, the ACA requires private \ninsurers to cover certain preventive-care services with-\nout \u201ccost sharing\u201d\u2014that is, without requiring the in-\nsured to pay deductibles, copayments, or other out-of-\npocket expenses.2  The ACA does not define \u201cpreven-\n \n1  Pub. L. No. 111-148, 124 Stat. 119 (2010). \n2  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(a) (\u201cA group health plan and a health in-\nsurance issuer offering group or individual health insurance shall, \n \n\n4a \n \ntive care,\u201d nor does it provide a list or examples of which \npreventive-care services must be covered.3  Instead, it \nempowers three agencies, all affiliated with the Depart-\nment of Health and Human Services (HHS), to deter-\nmine what services are required under four different \ncategories of care. \nThe first and most important category of mandated \ncoverage for purposes of this appeal includes \u201cevidence-\nbased items or services that have in effect a rating of \u2018A\u2019 \nor \u2018B\u2019 in the current recommendations of the United \nStates Preventive Services Task Force.\u201d 4  The Task \nForce is a body of sixteen volunteers \u201cwith appropriate \nexpertise\u201d5 who serve four-year terms and \u201cperiodically \nconvene\u201d to make recommendations on covered preventive- \ncare services.6  Members of the Task Force are \u201ccon-\nvened\u201d by the Director of the Agency for Healthcare Re-\n \nat a minimum provide coverage for and shall not impose any cost \nsharing requirements for\u201d four different categories of preventive \ncare). \n3  See generally id.; see also Little Sisters of the Poor Saints Peter \n& Paul Home v. Pennsylvania, 591 U.S. 657, 664 (2020) (\u201cThe stat-\nute itself does not define \u2018preventive care and screenings,\u2019 nor does \nit include an exhaustive or illustrative list of such services.  Thus, \nthe statute does not explicitly require coverage for any specific \nform of \u2018preventive care.\u2019\u200a\u201d). \n4  Id. \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(1). \n5  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(1). \n6  Act of Dec. 6, 1999, Pub. L. No. 106-129, 113 Stat. 1659,  \n\u00a7 915(a)(1).  The district court found that, in practice, Task Force \nmembers\u2019 work entailed meeting \u201cthree times a year for two days \nin Washington, D.C. (paid for by taxpayers),\u201d \u201cfrequent\u201d emailing, \n\u201cmultiple conference calls each month,\u201d and \u201cinteraction with stake-\nholders.\u201d  In all, \u201cmembers devote approximately 200 hours a \nyear outside of in-person meetings.\u201d \n\n5a \n \nsearch and Quality 7  (a subagency within the Public \nHealth Service, which in turn is a subagency within \nHHS).  There is, however, no removal restriction on \nTask Force members before the expiration of their \nterms.  The ACA instead provides that \u201c[a]ll members \nof the Task Force  . . .  and any recommendations \nmade by such members, shall be independent and, to the \nextent practicable, not subject to political pressure.\u201d8 \nThe second category of mandated coverage includes \n\u201cimmunizations that have in effect a recommendation \nfrom the Advisory Committee on Immunization Prac-\ntices of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \nwith respect to the individual involved.\u201d9  The Advisory \nCommittee on Immunization Practices, or ACIP, is part \nof the Public Health Service and is thus \u201cadministered \nby the Assistant Secretary for Health under the super-\nvision and direction of the [HHS] Secretary.\u201d 10  Ac-\ncording to its charter, ACIP consists of fifteen members \nwho serve four-year terms and are selected by the HHS \nSecretary.  ACIP is also one of several advisory com-\nmittees that report to the CDC Director, who in turn ex-\nercises authority delegated to him by the HHS Secre-\ntary.11 \nThe third and fourth categories of mandated cover-\nage include \u201cevidence-informed preventive care and \nscreenings provided for in the comprehensive guidelines \n \n7  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(1). \n8  Id. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(6). \n9  Id. \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(2). \n10 Id. \u00a7 202. \n11 See 80 Stat. 1610, Reorganization Plan No. 3 of 1966, \u00a7 1; see \nalso 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 243, 247b. \n\n6a \n \nsupported by the Health Resources and Services Ad-\nministration [HRSA]\u201d for infants, children, and adoles-\ncents,12 and \u201csuch additional preventive care and screen-\nings\u201d for women not already provided for by the Task \nForce.13  Like ACIP, HRSA is part of the Public Health \nService and is \u201cadministered by the Assistant Secretary \nfor Health under the supervision and direction of the \n[HHS] Secretary,\u201d14 but it does not consist of \u201cmem-\nbers,\u201d so to speak.  Rather, it consists of offices and bu-\nreaus that report to the Office of the Administrator, who \nin turn reports to the HHS Secretary.15 \nTogether, the Task Force, ACIP, and HRSA issue \nrecommendations and guidelines for preventive-care \nservices that most private insurers must cover by law.16  \nThese recommendations span a number of different \nhealthcare services, ranging from cancer-detection pro-\ncedures to physical therapy for older adults.  The many \namici in this case attest to the breadth and importance \nof these preventive-care services. \nThis is not to say, however, that all have gone without \nobjection.  As relevant here, in 2007, ACIP recom-\nmended the HPV vaccine for females ages eleven to \ntwelve.  Several years later, in 2011, HRSA issued \nguidelines recommending \u201ccontraceptive methods, ster-\nilization procedures, and patient education and counsel-\n \n12 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(3). \n13 Id. \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(4). \n14 Id. \u00a7 202. \n15 See id. \n16 Id. \u00a7 300gg-13(a). \n\n7a \n \ning for all women with reproductive capacity.\u201d17  And \nmost recently, in 2019, the Task Force issued an \u201cA\u201d rec-\nommendation for pre-exposure prophylaxis drugs (what \nthe parties refer to as \u201cPrEP\u201d drugs), which prevent the \ntransmission of HIV. \nB \nThe plaintiffs in this case, four individuals and two \nbusinesses, take issue with the specific recommenda-\ntions detailed above.  The individual plaintiffs are \nTexas residents who provide health insurance coverage \nfor themselves and their families, and the businesses are \nChristian-based for-profit companies that provide \nhealth insurance for their employees. 18  Collectively, \nthey object to the preventive-care mandates on religious \ngrounds and specifically allege that compulsory cover-\nage of these services requires them to violate their reli-\ngious beliefs \u201cby making them complicit in facilitating \nhomosexual behavior, drug use, and sexual activity out-\nside of marriage between one man and one woman.\u201d  \nFor those reasons, the plaintiffs all wish \u201cto obtain or \n \n17 Some of these guidelines, codified in various parts of the Code \nof Federal Regulations, became known as the \u201ccontraceptive man-\ndate.\u201d  See Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc., 573 U.S. 682, 692 \n(2014). \n18 The district court found that four of the ten plaintiffs who ob-\njected to the preventive-care mandates for purely economic reasons \n\u2014namely, Donovan Riddle, Karla Riddle, Joel Miller, and Gregory \nScheideman\u2014did not have standing.  Although these plaintiffs are \nlisted as cross-appellants in this appeal, they present no argument \non appeal that the district court erred in its standing analysis.  We \nwill thus leave the district court\u2019s judgment in this respect undis-\nturbed.  See Ctr. for Biological Diversity v. EPA, 937 F.3d 533, \n542 (5th Cir. 2019) (\u201cArguments in favor of standing, like all argu-\nments in favor of jurisdiction, can be forfeited or waived.\u201d). \n\n8a \n \nprovide health insurance that excludes or limits cover-\nage currently required by the preventive-care man-\ndates.\u201d \nTo that end, they filed suit in the summer of 2020 and \nnamed as defendants the federal government and the \nSecretaries of the Department of Health and Human \nServices, the Department of the Treasury, and the De-\npartment of Labor in their official capacities.19  Their \noperative complaint contains five claims, only one of \nwhich is now relevant on appeal.  They contend that the \nstructures of the Task Force, ACIP, and HRSA all vio-\nlate the Appointments Clause of the U.S. Constitution, \ninsofar as the members of each are acting as principal \nofficers of the United States who have not been nomi-\nnated by the President and confirmed by the Senate.20  \nIn their prayer for relief, the plaintiffs sought an injunc-\ntion prohibiting the Government from enforcing the pre-\nventive-care mandates against them. \n \n19 Some of the plaintiffs in this case had initially filed suit several \nyears ago in what they say was a \u201cresponse\u201d to the nationwide in-\njunction issued in Pennsylvania v. Trump, 351 F. Supp. 3d 791 \n(E.D. Penn. 2019).  In that prior litigation, also in the Northern \nDistrict of Texas, the plaintiffs obtained a permanent injunction \nprohibiting federal officials from enforcing the contraceptive man-\ndate, thus essentially putting back in place the conscience-based \nexemptions issued during the Trump administration.  See DeOtte \nv. Azar, 393 F. Supp. 3d 490, 514-15 (N.D. Tex. 2019).  A panel of \nthis court, however, later vacated that injunction as moot in light \nof Little Sisters of the Poor Saints Peter & Paul Home v. Pennsyl-\nvania, 591 U.S. 657 (2020).  See DeOtte v. Nevada, 20 F.4th 1055, \n1060 (5th Cir. 2021). \n20 See U.S. Const. art. II, \u00a7 2, cl. 2. \n\n9a \n \nIn its second of three summary-judgment rulings,21 \nthe district court rejected the plaintiffs\u2019 Appointments \nClause challenges against ACIP and HRSA but granted \nthe motion with respect to the Task Force.  In light of \nthe latter ruling, the district court instructed the parties \nto file supplemental briefing on, among other things, the \nscope of relief that should be given with respect to the \nTask Force\u2019s recommendations.  The parties obliged, \nand in its third and final summary-judgment order, the \ndistrict court concluded that the plaintiffs were entitled \nto a universal injunction and vacatur under \u00a7 706 of the \nAdministrative Procedure Act (APA).  The district \ncourt specifically vacated all agency action taken to en-\nforce the preventive-care mandates in response to the \nTask Force\u2019s recommendations and enjoined the Gov-\nernment from enforcing the preventive-care mandates \nagainst anyone.22 \n \n \n21 In its first, the district court ruled that, (1) in light of DeOtte, \nthe plaintiffs\u2019 challenge to the contraceptive mandate was barred \nby res judicata, and (2) the plaintiffs\u2019 suggested construction of  \n\u00a7 300gg-13(a) under the canon of constitutional avoidance\u2014that it \nbe read to encompass only those recommendations in effect at the \ntime of the ACA\u2019s enactment\u2014was unsupportable by the statute\u2019s \nplain text. \n22 In addition to the universal remedies, the district court also \nprovided party-specific relief, declaring that some of the plaintiffs \n\u201cneed not comply with the preventive care coverage recommenda-\ntions of [the Task Force] issued on or after March 23, 2010, because \nthe members of the Task Force have not been appointed in a man-\nner consistent with Article II\u2019s Appointments Clause.\u201d  For good \nmeasure, the district court also enjoined the Government defend-\nants \u201cfrom implementing or enforcing the [recommendations] \nagainst\u201d these plaintiffs. \n\n10a \n \nC \nThe parties timely cross-appealed.  The plaintiffs \nmaintain that the structure of both ACIP and HRSA vi-\nolate the Appointments Clause,23 while the Government \ncontinues to defend the constitutionality of the Task \nForce and its recommendations. 24  The Government, \nmoreover, sought a partial stay of the district court\u2019s \njudgment pending appeal.  A separate panel of this \ncourt carried the motion and administratively stayed the \ndistrict court\u2019s ruling to the extent it vacated and en-\njoined all agency actions taken to enforce the Task \nForce\u2019s recommendations. \nAfter briefing and oral argument on the motion, the \nparties filed a joint stipulation agreeing to a partial stay.  \nThe plaintiffs specifically acknowledged that the district \ncourt\u2019s injunction was incapable of immunizing them \nfrom statutory penalties in the event the district court\u2019s \n \n23 The plaintiffs also continue to press on appeal their argument \nthat 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(1)-(4) lacks an intelligible principle \nand therefore violates the nondelegation doctrine.  They acknow-\nledge, however, that their argument is foreclosed by our decision \nin Big Time Vapes, Inc. v. FDA, 963 F.3d 436 (5th Cir. 2020). \n24 Notably, the Government does not contest the district court\u2019s \ndetermination that at least six of the plaintiffs have Article III \nstanding.  Standing, of course, implicates our subject-matter ju-\nrisdiction, so we cannot assume that the plaintiffs have it merely \nbecause the Government does not argue otherwise.  See Ruhrgas \nAG v. Marathon Oil Co., 526 U.S. 574, 583 (1999).  Based on an \nindependent review of the record and the plaintiffs\u2019 allegations, we \nare satisfied that they have alleged an injury in fact that is tracea-\nble to the defendants\u2019 conduct and redressable by a favorable judi-\ncial decision.  See Allen v. Wright, 468 U.S. 737, 751 (1984). \n\n11a \n \njudgment was later vacated or reversed, 25  so they \nagreed to withdraw their opposition to the motion in ex-\nchange for the Government\u2019s promise not to take any \nenforcement action against them for their refusal to \ncover the mandated preventive care between the date of \nthe stipulation and the issuance of the mandate in this \nappeal.  Part of the district court\u2019s judgment thus re-\nmains stayed before this court, and we now review its \nlegal rulings de novo.26 \n \n25 We take no position on whether the plaintiffs\u2019 position on this \npoint is in fact correct.  It appears to be an open question and one \nthat we have no reason to answer today.

Abbott, 647 F.3d 202, \n208 (5th Cir. 2011). \n\n12a \n \nII \nThe primary point of contention between the parties, \nand the subject of much of the district court\u2019s thorough \nanalysis, is the constitutionality of the Task Force.  \nThe Government argued below that Task Force mem-\nbers were merely \u201cprivate citizens\u201d and did not qualify \nas officers under Article II.  It has now abandoned that \nargument on appeal and concedes that Task Force mem-\nbers are indeed officers who, by dint of their power to \nissue legally binding recommendations on preventive \ncare, exercise \u201csignificant authority pursuant to the \nlaws of the United States.\u201d27  The parties now dispute \nonly whether Task Force members are \u201cprincipal\u201d or \n\u201cinferior\u201d officers and, depending on which, whether \nSecretary Becerra has effectively cured the constitu-\ntional problems that inhere in their recommendations. \nA \nWe begin with the major premise of the plaintiffs\u2019 \nAppointments Clause challenge:  that the sixteen \nmembers of the Task Force are \u201cprincipal officers\u201d of \nthe United States who must be nominated by the Presi-\ndent and confirmed by the Senate. \nArticle II, section 2, clause 2 of the Constitution, \nmore familiarly known as the Appointments Clause, em-\npowers the President to \u201cnominate, and by and with the \nAdvice and Consent of the Senate, shall appoint  . . .  \nOfficers of the United States, whose Appointments are \nnot herein otherwise provided for, and which shall be es-\ntablished by Law.\u201d 28  The Appointments Clause also \n \n27 Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1, 126 (1976). \n28 U.S. CONST. art.

Prin-\ncipal officers must be appointed by the President and \nconfirmed by the Senate, whereas the appointment of \ninferior officers may, by law, be vested in the President, \njudiciary, or department heads.30 \nThe process for appointing officers of the United \nStates, as outlined above, was by no means preordained.  \nPerhaps owing to their experience under the English \nCrown and its unilateral appointments of royal gover-\nnors, as well as the unsatisfactory solution provided by \nsome early state constitutions to vest the appointment \npower exclusively with the legislature, the Framers \nfiercely debated the niceties of the appointments pro-\ncess.31  \u201cThe framers came to Philadelphia mindful of \nthe colonial legacy of monarchical appointment abuses,\u201d \none scholar recounts, \u201cyet equally fearful of legislative \n \n29 Id. \n30 Buckley, 424 U.S. at 132 (\u201cPrincipal officers are selected by the \nPresident with the advice and consent of the Senate.

In one of its first modern38 Appointments \nClause cases, Morrison v. Olson,39 the Supreme Court \nechoed Justice Story\u2019s lamentation.  \u201cThe line between \n\u2018inferior\u2019 and \u2018principal\u2019 officers is one that is far from \nclear,\u201d the Court observed, \u201cand the Framers provided \nlittle guidance into where it should be drawn.\u201d40  Un-\nsurprisingly, then, in determining the status of the inde-\npendent counsel in that case, the Morrison Court de-\nclined \u201cto decide exactly where the line falls between the \ntwo types of officers.\u201d41  Nevertheless, over a solo yet \nenduring dissent from Justice Scalia, the Court at-\ntempted to provide \u201c[s]everal factors\u201d guiding its deci-\nsion, asking whether the officer (1) is removable by a \n \n38 Like the ratification history, early cases interpreting the Ap-\npointments Clause\u2019s distinction between principal and inferior of-\nficers are also of limited utility.  \u201cIn fact,\u201d one court has com-\nmented, \u201cthe earliest Appointments Clause cases often employed \ncircular logic, granting officer status to an official based in part \nupon his appointment by the head of a department.\u201d  Landry v. \nFDIC, 204 F.3d 1125, 1132-33 (D.C. Cir. 2000) (citing, e.g., United \nStates v. Mouat, 124 U.S. 303, 307 (1888)).  The reasoning reso-\nnating from most Appointments Clause cases from the nineteenth \nand twentieth centuries can generally be characterized as a mix-\nture of deference and pragmatism, looking to what Congress had \ndone and the function of the office being evaluated.  See, e.g., Ex \nparte Hennen, 38 U.S. (13 Pet.) 230, 258 (1839); United States v. \nGermaine, 99 U.S. 508, 510 (1878); United States v. Eaton, 169 U.S. \n331, 336 (1898); Go-Bart Importing Co. v. United States, 282 U.S. \n344, 352 (1931). Justice Scalia, for his part, called some these cases \n\u201csketchy precedent.\u201d  Morrison v. Olson, 487 U.S. 654, 721 (1988) \n(Scalia, J., dissenting). \n39 487 U.S. 654 (1988). \n40 Id. at 671 (citing 2 STORY, supra note 37, \u00a7 1536, at 397-98). \n41 Id. \n\n16a \n \nhigher official, (2) has only certain, limited duties, (3) \nhas limited jurisdiction, and (4) has limited tenure.42 \nThe functional \u201cbalancing test\u201d43 employed in Mor-\nrison, however, would not survive long.  Writing for a \nnearly unanimous Court in Edmond v. United States44 \na decade later, and borrowing from his dissent in Mor-\nrison, Justice Scalia placed greater if not sole emphasis \non \nsubordination \nand \nsupervisory \nresponsibility.  \n\u201cGenerally speaking,\u201d he wrote for the Court, \u201cthe term \n\u2018inferior officer\u2019 connotes a relationship with some \nhigher ranking officer or officers below the President.\u201d45  \nSo \u201cwe think it evident,\u201d he continued, \u201cthat \u2018inferior of-\nficers\u2019 are officers whose work is directed and super-\nvised at some level by others who were appointed by \nPresidential nomination with the advice and consent of \nthe Senate.\u201d46 \nThe Court has twice since \u201creaffirm[ed] and appl[ied] \nthe rule from Edmond that the exercise of executive \npower by inferior officers must at some level be subject \nto the direction and supervision of an officer nominated \nby the President and confirmed by the Senate.\u201d47  First, \nin Free Enterprise Fund v. Public Company Account-\ning Oversight Board, the Court held that, without stat-\nutory removal restrictions, members of the Accounting \nOversight Board were inferior officers because the Se-\ncurities and Exchange Commission could \u201cremove Board \n \n42 Id. at 671-72. \n43 Id. at 711 (Scalia, J., dissenting). \n44 520 U.S. 651 (1997). \n45 Id. at 662. \n46 Id. at 663. \n47 United States v.

Arthrex, the \nCourt held that members of the Patent Trial and Appeal \nBoard were, effectively, principal officers because they \nhad the \u201cpower to render a final decision on behalf of the \nUnited States\u201d on the validity of existing patents with-\nout any \u201creview by a superior executive officer.\u201d49 \nThe general import of these Appointments Clause \ncases and others is that inferiority entails being con-\ntrolled and supervised by a superior.  At a high level, \nthen, the inquiry can be a bit circular.50  Yet there are \nsome discernable hallmarks of inferiority from the prec-\nedent, perhaps the most important of which is an of-\nficer\u2019s removability.51  As the plaintiffs acknowledge in \n \n48 Free Enter. Fund v. Pub. Co. Acct. Oversight Bd., 561 U.S. 477, \n510 (2010). \n49 Arthrex, 594 U.S. at 14 (quoting Edmond, 520 U.S. 651 at 655).  \nWe use the word \u201ceffectively\u201d because we recognize that there was \na disagreement between the majority and one of the dissents as to \nwhether the majority had in fact held that PTAB members were \nprincipal officers.  Compare id. at 23 (\u201cThe principal dissent re-\npeatedly charges that we never say whether APJs are principal of-\nficers who were not appointed in the manner required by the Ap-\npointments Clause.  . . .  \u201d), with id. at 46 (Thomas, J., dissent-\ning) (\u201cAlthough [the majority] cannot quite bring itself to say so \nexpressly, it too appears to hold that administrative patent judges \nare principal officers under the current statutory scheme.\u201d). \n50 Compare Principal Officer, BLACK\u2019S LAW DICTIONARY (11th \ned. 2019) (\u201cAn officer with the most authority of the officers being \nconsidered for some purpose.\u201d), with Inferior Officer, Black\u2019s Law \nDictionary (11th ed. 2019) (\u201cAn officer who is subordinate to an-\nother officer.\u201d). \n51 See Seila L. LLC v. CFPB, 140 S. Ct. 2183, 2191-92 (2020) (\u201cThe \nPresident\u2019s power to remove\u2014and thus supervise\u2014those who wield \n \n\n18a \n \ntheir brief on cross-appeal, \u201cat-will removal is the sine \nqua non of a dependent relationship.\u201d  Indeed, remov-\ning an officer at will is, as the Court in Edmond put it, \n\u201ca powerful tool for control.\u201d52 \nAnd on that score, we agree with the Government \nthat the HHS Secretary may remove members of the \nTask Force at will.  At-will removal is the background \nrule unless Congress clearly and expressly says other-\nwise,53 and neither we nor the plaintiffs can identify an-\nything in the ACA or elsewhere that displaces that back-\nground rule.  Granted, the plaintiffs are quick to point \nout that 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(6) requires Task Force \nmembers to \u201cbe independent and, to the extent practi-\ncable, not subject to political pressure.\u201d  And we agree \nthat, on its face, this particular provision provides a level \nof protection to the Task Force members and their \nwork.

Yellen, 141 S. Ct. 1761, 1782 (2021) (\u201cWhen a \nstatute does not limit the President\u2019s power to remove an agency \nhead, we generally presume that the officer serves at the Presi-\ndent\u2019s pleasure.\u201d); see also Shurtleff v. United States, 189 U.S. 311, \n315 (1903) (requiring \u201cvery clear and explicit language\u201d in the stat-\nute to establish removal limitations).  The plaintiffs contend that \nthese cases merely stand for the proposition that there must be \n\u201cclear statutory language before courts will enforce limits on the \nPresident\u2019s removal powers,\u201d not other executive officers\u2019, like the \nHHS Secretary.  We see no reason, however, why the presump-\ntion would be limited to the President.  If anything, such an arti-\nficial limitation would further disrupt the efficiency of the execu-\ntive power that Article II contemplates, see Seila L., 140 S. Ct. at \n2197, and we are not in the business of thinking up limitations our-\nselves. \n\n19a \n \nand express restriction on their removal.  The provi-\nsion does not resemble other provisions that more \nplainly restrict removal,54 and if there were any doubt \nabout the meaning of \u00a7 299b-4(a)(6), we are not predis-\nposed to resolve it in the plaintiffs\u2019 favor.  We generally \nconstrue statutes in a way that avoids, rather than in-\nvites, constitutional infirmity.55  So we agree with the \nGovernment that, whatever else \u00a7 299b-4(a)(6) means, it \ndoes not inhibit the HHS Secretary from removing the \nTask Force members at his will. \nWe part ways with the Government, however, in its \nsubmission that our analysis should stop there.  More \nspecifically, we disagree that \u201cthe Secretary\u2019s at-will re-\nmoval authority is,\u201d as the Government submits, \u201csuffi-\ncient to render the Task Force members constitution-\nally subordinate.\u201d  The case the Government cites for \nthat proposition, Free Enterprise Fund, does not stand \nfor it.  To the contrary, it was the SEC\u2019s removal \npower, along with its oversight authority, that rendered \nmembers of the Accounting Oversight Board inferior of-\nficers. 56  The Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in Edmond \n \n54 E.g., 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 153(a) (\u201cAny member of the [National Rela-\ntions] Board may be removed by the President, upon notice and \nhearing, for neglect of duty or malfeasance in office, but for no \nother cause.\u201d); 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2053(a) (\u201cAny member of the Commis-\nsion may be removed by the President for neglect of duty or mal-\nfeasance in office but for no other cause.\u201d). \n55 See United States ex rel. Att\u2019y Gen. v. Del. & Hudson Co., 213 \nU.S. 366, 408 (1909) (\u201c[W]here a statute is susceptible to two con-\nstructions, by one of which grave and doubtful constitutional ques-\ntions arise and by the other of which such questions are avoided, \nour duty is to adopt the latter.\u201d). \n56 See Free Enter. Fund, 561 U.S. at 510 (\u201cGiven that the Com-\nmission is properly viewed, under the Constitution, as possessing \n \n\n20a \n \nand Arthrex likewise demonstrate that removability is \nnot the sole criterion by which to judge inferiority. 57  \nIndeed, another important consideration, if not equally \nso, is the extent to which the Task Force\u2019s work can be \nsupervised by a higher-ranking executive official, like \nSecretary Becerra. \nOn that front, we cannot say that any such supervi-\nsion exists\u2014as a matter of law or reality.  The statu-\ntory scheme, insofar as it concerns recommendations \nfrom the Task Force, contemplates complete autonomy.  \nIndeed, we need look no further than the statutory pro-\nvision we just addressed, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(6), which \nagain provides that \u201c[a]ll members of the Task Force  \n. . .  , and any recommendations made by such mem-\nbers, shall be independent and, to the extent practicable, \nnot subject to political pressure.\u201d  While \u00a7 299b-4(a)(6) \nis not a clear and express removal restriction, as we con-\ncluded above, it is a clear and express directive from \nCongress that the Task Force be free from any supervi-\nsion.  In our view, the Task Force cannot be \u201cindepend-\nent\u201d and free from \u201cpolitical pressure\u201d on the one hand, \nand at the same time be supervised by the HHS Secre-\ntary, a political appointee, on the other. \n \nthe power to remove Board members at will, and given the Com-\nmission\u2019s oversight authority, we have no hesitation in concluding \nthat under Edmond the Board members are inferior officers whose \nappointment Congress may permissibly vest in a \u2018Hea[d] of De-\npartmen[t].\u2019\u200a\u201d  (alterations in original) (emphasis added)). \n57 See Edmond, 520 U.S. at 663 (\u201c\u200a\u2018[I]nferior officers\u2019 are officers \nwhose work is directed and supervised at some level by others.  \n. . .  \u201d); Arthrex, 594 U.S. at 17-18 (\u201c[I]t certainly is the norm for \nprincipal officers to have the capacity to review decisions made by \ninferior adjudicative officers.\u201d  (internal quotations omitted)). \n\n21a \n \nInvoking the constitutional-doubt canon again, the \nGovernment resists this conclusion by emphasizing the \nqualifying language in \u00a7 299b-4(a)(6).  By its terms, the \nprovision says that the Task Force shall be free from \npolitical pressure only \u201cto the extent practicable,\u201d and \nthis qualifier, according to the Government, signals flex-\nibility in our ability to construe the provision in a way to \nmake the broader scheme constitutional.  The Govern-\nment, in other words, urges us to read \u201cto the extent \npracticable\u201d as \u201cto the extent constitutional.\u201d \nWe decline to do so.  The first flaw with the Govern-\nment\u2019s argument is a textual one.  Assuming \u201cpractica-\nble\u201d and \u201cconstitutional\u201d are synonymous (a doubtful se-\nmantic proposition to start), the phrase \u201cto the extent \npracticable\u201d modifies only freedom from \u201cpolitical pres-\nsure,\u201d not \u201cindependent.\u201d58  So even if we thought that \n\u00a7 299b-4(a)(6) provided some interpretive flexibility \nwith respect to the amount of political pressure that the \nHHS Secretary could place on the Task Force, the \nterms of the provision prevent us from using that same \nflexibility with respect to the Task Force\u2019s statutorily \nrequired independence.59  More fundamentally, though, \n \n58 See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(6) (\u201cAll members of the Task Force \nconvened under this subsection, and any recommendations made \nby such members, shall be independent and, to the extent practica-\nble, not subject to political pressure.\u201d). \n59 The Government makes the point that \u201cindependence\u201d in this \ncontext does not necessarily mean decisionmaking without super-\nvision, but simply \u201cunbiased\u201d or \u201cdispassionate\u201d decisionmaking.  \nThis is a creative but unpersuasive argument.  The most natural \nreading of \u201cindependent\u201d in \u00a7 299b-4(a)(6), given its juxtaposition \nto the additional requirement that the Task Force not be \u201csubject \nto political pressure,\u201d is one that connotes freedom from outside \ncontrol. \n\n22a \n \neven if we read \u00a7 299b-4(a)(6) to permit a level of review \nby the HHS Secretary \u201cnecessary to ensure conformity \nwith constitutional requirements,\u201d as the Government \ninvites us to do, it is unclear how much review that \nshould be.  If we were to read \u00a7 299b-4(a)(6) to allow \nthe Secretary to review all the Task Force\u2019s recommen-\ndations, then the Task Force would have no political in-\ndependence at all, contrary to the terms of the provision.  \nAnd if we were to read \u00a7 299b-4(a)(6) to allow the Secre-\ntary to review only some of the recommendations (how \nmany, we do not know), then that would invite an obvi-\nous line-drawing problem for which the provision pro-\nvides no readily discernable solution.  For understand-\nable reasons, the Government does not offer any textu-\nally plausible way to draw the line,60 and we decline to \ncontort the provision in an effort to essentially guess \nwhat the constitutionally optimal amount of \u201cpolitical \npressure\u201d ought to be.61 \n \n \n60 One could read the Government\u2019s brief to suggest that we \nought to draw the line between recommendations that have \u201cA\u201d and \n\u201cB\u201d ratings and those that do not; or, more finely, between those \nrecommendations that have \u201cA\u201d and \u201cB\u201d ratings that specifically \nqualify under \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(1) and those that do not.  Whichever \nway the Government might suggest such a line, we decline to draw \nit.  Section 299b-4(a)(6) makes no distinction between types of \nrecommendations, as \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(1) does, and our modest inter-\npretive authority gives us no basis to begin picking and choosing \nhow and when the HHS Secretary must exercise a power of review \nthat is not otherwise contemplated by the statutory text. \n61 See Seila L., 140 S. Ct. at 2211 (\u201cConstitutional avoidance is not \na license to rewrite Congress\u2019s work to say whatever the Constitu-\ntion needs it to say in a given situation.\u201d). \n\n23a \n \nWe are also mindful that, however willing we may be \nto accept the Government\u2019s invitation to be \u201cflexible,\u201d \nwe cannot read \u00a7 299b-4(a)(6) in a way that is incon-\nsistent with other parts of the statutory scheme.  For \nexample, under \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(1), insurers \u201cshall\u201d pro-\nvide coverage for preventive-care services recom-\nmended by the Task Force, and under \u00a7 300gg-13(b)(1), \nthe HHS Secretary \u201cshall establish a minimum interval \nbetween the date on which a recommendation  . . .  is \nissued and the plan year with respect to which [the cov-\nerage requirement] is effective with respect to the ser-\nvice described in such recommendation or guideline.\u201d  \nIn other words, the HHS Secretary has no power over \nthe content of the Task Force\u2019s recommendations; his \nauthority extends to only when those recommendations \nbecome binding.62  In short, the statutory scheme out-\nlining the process by which the preventive-care recom-\nmendations are issued and made effective envisions no \nsupervisory role for the Secretary, and that is especially \nclear in light of the express congressional preference \nthat the Task Force be independent and not subject to \npolitical pressure. \nOur conclusions regarding the various statutory pro-\nvisions governing the respective roles of the Task Force \nand the HHS Secretary in issuing the preventive-care \n \n62 See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(b).  The Government seems to sug-\ngest that the Secretary could fix the constitutional problem by re-\nfusing to give binding legal effect to the Task Force\u2019s recommen-\ndations under this provision.  Assuming we were to embrace the \nSecretary\u2019s abdication of his statutory role as an ersatz solution to \nthe broader structural problem, it is unclear to us how this proposal \nwould change anything about the recommendations and guidelines \nthat have already taken effect under \u00a7 300gg-13(b) and currently \ngive rise to the plaintiffs\u2019 alleged injuries. \n\n24a \n \nmandates are, thus far, twofold:  (1) Task Force mem-\nbers are subject to at-will removal by the HHS Secre-\ntary; and (2) the Task Force\u2019s \u201crecommendations\u201d on  \nlegally mandated coverage of preventive care go  \nunreviewed\u2014and are unreviewable\u2014by a higher-rank-\ning officer.  The Task Force members thus have attrib-\nutes of both inferior and principal officers, and we now \nhave the uneasy but necessary task of determining how \nto resolve the competing considerations. \nIn our view, the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Arthrex, \nas informed by Edmond, requires us to resolve those \nconsiderations in favor of holding that the Task Force \nmembers are principal officers.  As we have already \nbriefly recounted above, the question presented in Ar-\nthrex was whether members of the Patent Trial and Ap-\npeal Board, or PTAB, were constitutionally appointed \nofficers in light of their power to give the \u201cfinal word\u201d \non the validity of challenged patents.63  The Court an-\nswered that question in the negative, holding that the \nappointment of PTAB members as inferior officers was \ninconsistent with the \u201cnature of their responsibilities\u201d\u2014 \nspecifically, their \u201cpower to render a final decision on \nbehalf of the United States\u201d on patent claims \u201cwithout \nany  . . .  review by their nominal superior or any \nother principal officer in the Executive Branch.\u201d64 \nThe similarities between the PTAB in Arthrex and \nthe Task Force in this case are close, if not dispositive, \nof the issue before us.  Like the PTAB, the Task Force \ncan, and does, issue legally binding decisions without \nany review by a higher-ranking officer.  Private insur-\n \n63 Arthrex, 594 U.S. at 6. \n64 Id. at 13-14. \n\n25a \n \ners are legally required to cover its preventive-care rec-\nommendations,65 and there is no way for the HHS Sec-\nretary (or anyone else) to review, revise, or otherwise \nreject those recommendations.66  It is no answer, as the \nGovernment argues, that the HHS Secretary can exer-\ncise indirect control over the Task Force\u2019s recommenda-\ntions through his removal power, because post hoc re-\nmoval, as in Arthrex, does not change the fact that there \nis still \u201cno means of countermanding the final decision \n[of the Task Force] already on the books.\u201d 67   The \nscheme the Supreme Court rejected in Arthrex thus \nmimics the scheme in this case in many material re-\nspects. \nAnd yet we arguably have even more compelling rea-\nsons to be skeptical of the scheme\u2019s constitutionality \nhere, because there was at least the prospect of Article \nIII review of the PTAB\u2019s decisions in Arthrex68 (which \nno one suggests we have of the Task Force\u2019s recommen-\ndations), and the unreviewable power the Task Force \nwields\u2014promulgating preventive-care coverage man-\ndated for private insurers\u2014is indisputably significant.69  \nPut simply, the Task Force exercises substantial power, \nand the absence of any supervision over this power \n \n65 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(1). \n66 See id. \u00a7\u00a7 300gg-13(b), 299b-4(a)(6). \n67 Arthrex, 594 U.S. at 16. \n68 See id. at 17 (\u201cReview outside Article II\u2014here, an appeal to \nthe Federal Circuit\u2014cannot provide the necessary supervision.\u201d). \n69 See id. (\u201cEdmond calls [for] an appraisal of how much power \nan officer exercises free from control by a superior\u201d to distinguish \nbetween inferior and principal officers.).  As the Government has \nalready conceded, the Task Force exercises \u201csignificant authority \npursuant to the laws of the United States.\u201d  Buckley, 424 U.S. at \n126. \n\n26a \n \n\u201cgoes a long way,\u201d if not all the way, \u201ctoward resolving \nthis dispute\u201d about whether to classify members of the \nTask Force as principal officers.70 \nAccordingly, we hold that members of the Task Force \nare principal officers under Article II of the Constitu-\ntion who must be\u2014yet have not been\u2014nominated by the \nPresident and confirmed by the Senate.71 \nB \nBecause we have concluded that members of the Task \nForce are principal officers of the United States, we \nneed not address the effect of Secretary Becerra\u2019s affi-\ndavit, dated June 23, 2023, purporting to appoint the \nmembers as inferior officers.72  Apart from that make-\nshift solution, however, the Secretary has also at-\ntempted to cure the constitutional defects in the Task \nForce\u2019s recommendations through ratification.  The \nGovernment points us to a memo issued by Secretary \nBecerra dated January 21, 2022, purporting to ratify all \nthe recommendations issued thus far by the Task Force.  \nAccording to the Government, the Secretary\u2019s memo \ncures whatever defects afflict the Task Force\u2019s recom-\nmendations because they now have the imprimatur of a \nprincipal officer. \nTo our knowledge, neither we nor the Supreme \nCourt73 has embraced ratification as a remedy for an \n \n70 Id. at 14. \n71 U.S. CONST. art. II, \u00a7 2, cl. 2. \n72 See U.S. DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, \nRATIFICATION OF PRIOR APPOINTMENT AND PROSPECTIVE AP-\nPOINTMENT AFFIDAVIT (2023), https://perma.cc/8TAA-7AMN. \n73 As best we can tell, the Supreme Court has alluded to the no-\ntion of ratification at least once in an Appointments Clause case.  \n \n\n27a \n \nAppointments Clause issue.  The remedial theory \nseems to be well established, however, in a few of our \nsister circuits.  The D.C. Circuit, for example, has \u201cre-\npeatedly held that a properly appointed official\u2019s ratifi-\ncation of an allegedly improper official\u2019s prior action, ra-\nther than mooting [the] claim, resolves the claim on the \nmerits by \u2018remedy[ing] [the] defect\u2019 (if any) from the in-\nitial appointment.\u201d74  The Government represents that \nother circuits, such as the Second, Third, and Ninth, \nhave followed suit. 75  Based on our reading of these \ncases, they rest on basic principles of agency, to the ex-\ntent that ratification can retroactively effect actual au-\nthority for the improper official\u2019s disputed action.76 \nAssuming we were to also adopt the proposition that \nratification can cure an improperly appointed official\u2019s \nprior actions, however, we would still be unconvinced \nthat Secretary Becerra\u2019s purported ratification of the \nTask Force\u2019s recommendations cures the constitutional \nproblem in this case.  That is principally because, as we \nhave already discussed, the Secretary does not have the \nstatutory authority to either review, revise, or issue the \npreventive-care recommendations himself.  That fact \n \nIn Edmond, the Court mentioned in passing that the Secretary of \nTransportation had, in anticipation of a potential Appointments \nClause problem, \u201cissued a memorandum \u2018adopting\u2019\u200a\u201d a lower-level \nofficer\u2019s assignments to inferior officers.  520 U.S. at 654. \n74 Guedes v.

Thrasher, 62 F.2d 944, 946 (5th Cir. 1933). \n\n28a \n \nalone is fatal to the Government\u2019s ratification theory.  \n\u201c[I]t is essential,\u201d the Supreme Court has held, \u201cthat the \nparty ratifying should be able not merely to do the act \nratified at the time the act was done, but also at the time \nthe ratification was made.\u201d77  In another one of its Ap-\npointments Clause cases, the D.C. Circuit has similarly \nadhered to the principle that \u201cratification can remedy a \ndefect arising from the decision of an improperly ap-\npointed official  . . .  when  . . .  a properly ap-\npointed official has the power to conduct an independent \nevaluation of the merits and does so.\u201d78  So even if we \nwere to go along with the Government\u2019s ratification the-\nory, the argument would fail on its own terms, because \nno agency relationship exists when the purported \u201cprin-\ncipal\u201d cannot do what his agent does.  Nor, in the same \nvein, is an agent\u2019s relationship to his principal typically \ncharacterized by independence, as the Task Force\u2019s is \nwith the HHS Secretary by statute.79 \nWith respect to whether the HHS Secretary has \nprincipal-like authority over the Task Force, the Gov-\nernment mostly reasserts the same arguments it made \non the principal-versus-inferior officer issue.  For the \nsame reasons we have already rejected those argu-\nments, we can also reject them here.  For the sake of \ncompleteness, though, we address one more, because it \n \n77 FEC v. NRA Pol.

According to the Government, Secretary \nBecerra can supervise the Task Force by virtue of stat-\nutory hierarchy.  The Task Force, the Government ex-\nplains, is convened by a subagency within the Public \nHealth Service, which in turn \u201cis administered by the \nAssistant Secretary for Health under the supervision \nand direction of the [HHS] Secretary.\u201d80  Based on this \nstructure, the Government contends, the Task Force is \neffectively \u201cunder the supervision and direction of the \nSecretary.\u201d \nWe are not persuaded.  The inference the Govern-\nment asks us to draw is a plausible one, and statutory \nstructure is indeed a key ingredient in the interpretive \nenterprise. 81  But relying on \u00a7 202 to show that the \nHHS Secretary plays a particular role in the statutory \nscheme, as the Government attempts to do, can in some \nsense beg the question.  The Assistant Secretary is \ncharged under \u00a7 202 to \u201cadminister\u201d the Public Health \nService, and he must do so as that body is currently  \nconstituted\u2014with its various subagencies and their own \nstatutory schemes.  The Assistant Secretary, in other \nwords, has no authority to reconfigure a legislative de-\nsign by virtue of his duty to \u201cadminister\u201d the Public \nHealth Service, and the HHS Secretary, by the same to-\nken, has no more authority to do so just because he \u201csu-\npervis[es] and direct[s]\u201d the Assistant Secretary\u2019s ad-\nministration.82  At most, they could \u201cconvene\u201d and sup-\n \n80 Id. \u00a7 202. \n81 See, e.g., United States v.

Such secre-\ntarial review would not conflict with any other applica-\nble statutory provision, to be sure, but the Government \ndoes not explain from where the Secretary\u2019s power to \nreview the recommendations would derive once we de-\ncide to disregard the command of \u00a7 299b-4(a)(6).  As we \nhave already observed, Congress contemplated a lim-\nited, ministerial role for the Secretary with respect to \nthe preventive-care recommendations, as the mechanics \nof \u00a7 300gg-13(a)-(b) bear out, and the HHS Reorganiza-\ntion Plan No. 3 of 1996 further makes clear that any \n\u201cfunctions vested by law in any advisory council, board, \n \ning the extent to which superior law displaces inferior law.\u201d), with \nWilliam Baude, Severability First Principles, 109 Va.

The Court in Arthrex, of \ncourse, concluded that the offending provision\u2014\u00a7 6(c) of \nthe America Invents Act\u2014\u201ccannot constitutionally be \nenforced to the extent that its requirements prevent the \nDirector from reviewing final decisions rendered by the \nAPJs.\u201d89  By declining to enforce that provision, the \nCourt allowed the Director to exercise the \u201cpowers and \nduties\u201d vested in him by Congress and to accordingly \n\u201creview[] PTAB decisions\u201d and even \u201cissue decisions \nhimself on behalf of the Board.\u201d90  In this case, by con-\ntrast, Congress bestowed no such power upon the HHS \nSecretary.

Even so, the plaintiffs\u2019 vacatur demand undenia-\nbly came \u201cat a  . . .  later stage of the proceedings,\u201d110 \nand it was of \u201csubstantially different character from that \nrequested\u201d in their operative complaint.111  Specifically, \nthe demand came during the third round of summary-\njudgment briefing, just before the notice of appeal was \nfiled, and the remedy had the effect of invalidating many \nagency actions, none of which the plaintiffs challenged \nin their live complaint.  In fact, the one APA claim the \nplaintiffs asserted in their original complaint\u2014which \ntook aim at the many preventive-care recommendations \nthat they now assert are unlawful\u2014was abandoned in \ntheir amended complaint.  We continue to adhere to \nthe view that Rule 54(c) offers \u201cremedial latitude,\u201d112 in-\nsofar as judgments need not be limited to the kind or \n \n109 FED. R. CIV. P. 54(c). \n110 Engel v.

In the plaintiffs\u2019 view, vacatur under the \nAPA is appropriate here because their successful con-\nstitutional challenge to the preventive-care coverage \nmandates under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13 necessarily impli-\ncates the lawfulness of the regulations and agency ac-\ntions taken under them.  This argument, we think, has \nsound logic,114 but it is one that is also foreclosed by \nDeanda.  As the panel in that case recognized, the \n\u201csubstantive rulings were incompatible with the regula-\ntion\u2019s lawfulness,\u201d but it was still \u201cnot the same as adju-\ndicating an APA challenge to a regulation.\u201d 115   We \nmust, therefore, also reject this theory of upholding the \ndistrict court\u2019s vacatur remedy. \nB \nBecause we do not find any support for the district \ncourt\u2019s decision to vacate all agency actions taken to en-\nforce the Task Force\u2019s recommendations, we also cannot \n \n113 CHARLES ALLEN WRIGHT & MARY KAY KANE, LAW OF FED-\nERAL COURTS 631 (8th ed. 2017). \n114 Cf.

It is worth noting that the fact we are reviewing \nthe constitutionality of federal law can also cut against universal \nrelief, because unlike a universal injunction against the enforce-\nment of state law, one against the enforcement of federal law pre-\nsents more practical percolation problems.  See Trump, 585 U.S. \nat 713 (THOMAS, J., concurring) (\u201cThese [universal] injunctions are \nbeginning to take a toll on the federal court system\u2014preventing legal \nquestions from percolating through the federal courts.  . . .  \u201d).  \nThere is also, not to mention, the issue of nonmutual offensive col-\nlateral estoppel and the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in United States \nv.

Freedom, 63 \nF.4th at 387 (noting that injunctions \u201ccould benefit nonparties as \nlong as that benefit was merely incidental\u201d (internal quotation \nomitted)).  But we think it indicative of its overbreadth that the \ndistrict court\u2019s universal injunction in this case would ultimately \nbenefit some of the parties in this lawsuit whom it found lacked \nstanding. \n\n44a \n \ndo so is subject only to the HHS Secretary\u2019s \u201cinterval\u201d \ndetermination under subsection (b).125 \nThe similarities, however, disappear once our review \nextends past that cabined preventive-care scheme.  \nWith respect to ACIP, its preventive-care recommenda-\ntions must first be approved by the CDC Director before \nthey can take effect.126  The CDC Director, in turn, de-\nrives his authority from the HHS Secretary, who can \ncountermand the CDC Director\u2019s decisions to approve \nACIP\u2019s vaccine recommendations. 127  Similarly, with \nrespect to HRSA, Secretary Becerra can exercise con-\ntrol over the guidelines it publishes by virtue of the \ntransfer of power in HHS\u2019s Reorganization Plan No. 3 \nof 1966.  There, Congress authorized the Secretary to \nperform \u201call functions of the Public Health Service  \n. . .  and all functions of all agencies of or in the Public \nHealth Service.\u201d128  Thus, unlike his power vis-\u00e0-vis the \n \n125 See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(b) (\u201cThe [HHS] Secretary shall es-\ntablish a minimum interval between the date on which a recommen-\ndation described in subsection (a)(1) and (a)(2) or a guideline under \nsubsection (a)(3) is issued and the plan year with respect to which \nthe requirement described in subsection (a) is effective with re-\nspect to the service described in such recommendation or guide-\nline.\u201d). \n126 See 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 147.130(a)(1)(ii) (\u201c[A] recommendation from \n[ACIP] is considered in effect after it has been adopted by the Di-\nrector of the [CDC].\u201d). \n127 See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 243; see also id. \u00a7 242c. \n128 80 Stat. 1610 (1966).  The plaintiffs contend that HRSA did \nnot exist until 1982, so the Reorganization Plan No. 3 of 1966 could \nnot have transferred its powers and functions to the HHS Secre-\ntary.  The plaintiffs recognize, however, that this argument is all \nbut foreclosed by Willy v. Administrative Review Board, 423 F.3d \n483, 491-92 (5th Cir. 2005), in which we held that the Reorganiza-\ntion Plan No. 6 of 1950, which predated the creation of the Admin-\n \n\n45a \n \nTask Force, Secretary Becerra has fallback powers on \nwhich he can exercise supervisory authority over ACIP \nand HRSA\u2014authority, in our view, that encompasses \nthe prerogative to ratify their preventive-care recommen-\ndations and guidelines made pursuant to \u00a7 300gg-13(a).129 \nAccording to the Government, the Secretary has ex-\nercised this statutory prerogative and has effectively \ncured whatever Appointments Clause issues afflict \nACIP and HRSA. Like it did with the Task Force, the \nGovernment points to Secretary Becerra\u2019s memo of Jan-\nuary 21, 2022, in which he purported to ratify all the rec-\nommendations and guidelines thus far issued by ACIP \nand HRSA. \nEven if we were prepared to accept ratification as a \nvalid means of curing Appointments Clause defects, \nhowever, we cannot accept the Secretary\u2019s attempt to do \nso here\u2014at least at this juncture.  That is because the \nplaintiffs put forward compelling and essentially unre-\nbutted arguments that there are serious APA problems \nwith the Secretary\u2019s ratification memo.  They specifi-\ncally contend that the Secretary\u2019s memo (1) failed to go \nthrough notice-and-comment rulemaking,130 (2) is arbi-\n \nistrative Review Board within the Department of Labor, trans-\nferred to the Secretary of Labor the power to appoint members of \nthe Administrative Review Board. \n129 See Free Enter.

Mem. Op. 41-42, ECF No. 92.  The Court \nordered supplemental briefing regarding standing for \nthe non-Braidwood Plaintiffs, the non-Braidwood reli-\ngious objector Plaintiffs\u2019 Religious Freedom Restora-\ntion Act claim with respect to the PrEP coverage man-\ndate, and the appropriate scope of relief for the success-\nful parties.  Id.  Having considered the parties\u2019 brief-\ning and applicable law on those issues, and in light of its \nprior decision on the merits in favor of Defendants, the \nCourt DISMISSES with prejudice the religious objector \nPlaintiffs\u2019, including Braidwood Management Inc.\u2019s, \ncontraceptive mandate claim.  The non-religious objec-\ntor Plaintiffs\u2019 contraceptive mandate claim is DIS-\nMISSED without prejudice for lack of subject matter ju-\nrisdiction.  Because the Court concludes that the PrEP \ncoverage mandate violates RFRA, the Court GRANTS \nthe non-Braidwood religious objector Plaintiffs\u2019 sum-\nmary judgment motion and DENIES Defendants\u2019 sum-\nmary judgment motion on this claim. \nTherefore, the Court GRANTS all religious objector \nPlaintiffs\u2019, including Braidwood Management Inc.\u2019s, re-\nquest for declaratory and injunctive relief as to this \nclaim.  Finally, in light of its prior ruling that 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 300gg-13(a)(1)\u2019s compulsory preventive care coverage \nrequirements in response to an \u201cA\u201d or \u201cB\u201d rating by the \n\n51a \n \nU.S. Preventive Services Task Force made on or after \nMarch 23, 2010 violates the Appointments Clause, the \nCourt GRANTS Plaintiffs\u2019 request for declaratory and \ninjunctive relief with respect to this claim, VACATES \nany and all agency actions implementing or enforcing \nthat provisions\u2019 mandatory coverage requirements, and \nENJOINS Defendants and their officers, agents, serv-\nants, and employees from implementing or enforcing the \ncompulsory preventive care coverage mandate in the fu-\nture. \nI. \nBACKROUND \n \nA. \nLegal Background \nOn March 23, 2010, Congress enacted the Patient \nProtection and Affordable Care Act (ACA), which dic-\ntates four categories of preventive care services most \nprivate health insurance companies must cover.  42 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13.  The Act empowers three agencies \n\u2014the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (PSTF), the \nHealth Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), \nand the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices \n(ACIP)\u2014to unilaterally determine what kinds of pre-\nventive care fall within each category of mandatory cov-\nerage by issuing guidelines or recommendations that, by \noperation of the statute, carry the force of law.  Id.  \nSpecifically, PSTF recommends \u201cA\u201d or \u201cB\u201d ratings for \nspecific evidence-based items and services for all patient \ndemographics; HRSA issues \u201ccomprehensive guidance\u201d \nregarding preventive care and screening for infants, \nchildren, adolescents, and women; and ACIP recom-\nmends certain immunizations.  Id. \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(1)-(4).  \nPrivate health insurers must cover and cannot impose \ncost sharing requirements for these recommended ser-\nvices.  Id. \u00a7 300gg-13(a). \n\n52a \n \nWhile all three agencies are affiliated with the U.S. \nDepartment of Health and Human Services (HHS), they \nare not all identically structured.  ACIP and HRSA \nwere created by the Secretary of HHS to provide vac-\ncine recommendations and guidance on programs and \nactivities within the agency.1  See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 217a(a) \n(authorizing HHS Secretary to create advisory councils \nor committees).  Both ACIP and HRSA are ultimately \nsubject to the \u201csupervision and direction\u201d of the HHS \nSecretary.  42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 202, 243, 247b.2  By contrast, \nPSTF is a volunteer body of non-federal experts that \nprovides evidence-based recommendations related to \npreventive care services and health promotion.3  And \nthough the Task Force receives support from AHRQ, an \nagency within HHS, the Task Force is not itself a part \nof AHRQ or HHS.4  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(1).  When it \ncreated PSTF, Congress specified that the Task Force\u2019s \nrecommendations \u201cshall be independent and, to the ex-\n \n1 Mem. Op. 3, ECF No. 92. \n2 Mem.

Though PSTF is not housed within another federal agency, \ngiven its authority to compel insurers to cover recommended ser-\nvices through issuance of ratings in conjunction with the ACA\u2019s \ncompulsory coverage requirements, the Task Force members func-\ntion as \u201cofficers\u201d of the United States that exercise significant legal \nauthority and are therefore referred to as an \u201cagency\u201d for purposes \nof this Opinion.  Mem.

Among those, and rele-\nvant to the case at hand, are HRSA\u2019s 2011 guidance com-\npelling insurance companies to cover all FDA-approved \ncontraceptive methods\u2014including certain abortifacients \n(\u201ccontraceptive mandate\u201d)\u2014and PSTF\u2019s 2019 issuance \nof an \u201cA\u201d rating for preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) \ndrugs that are used by persons at high risk of HIV ac-\nquisition (\u201cPrEP mandate\u201d). 5   For purposes of this \nOpinion, the Court refers collectively to agency guid-\nance or recommendations made compulsory through op-\neration of \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(1) through (a)(4), and including \nthe contraceptive and PrEP mandates, as the \u201cpreven-\ntive care mandates.\u201d \n \nB. The Parties \nPlaintiffs are six individuals and two businesses who \nchallenge the legality of the preventive care mandates \nas violative of the Constitution and the Religious Free-\ndom Restoration Act (RFRA).  Each desires the option \nto purchase or provide insurance that excludes or limits \ncoverage currently required by the preventive care man-\ndates and argues that Defendants\u2019 implementation and \nenforcement of the preventive care mandates prevents \nthem from doing so.  Each Plaintiff objects to the pre-\nventive care mandates for religious or personal reasons, \nor both.6 \n \n5 Pls.\u2019 App. 21, 12, ECF No. 46. \n6 For purposes of this Opinion, the Court refers to Plaintiffs Mil-\nler, Scheideman, and Fort Worth Oral Surgery as the \u201cnon-reli-\ngious objector Plaintiffs\u201d; to Plaintiffs Kelley, Starnes, Maxwell, \n \n\n54a \n \nPlaintiffs John Kelley, Joel Starnes, Zach Maxwell, \nand Ashley Maxwell provide health coverage for them-\nselves and their families.  They want the option to pur-\nchase health insurance that excludes or limits coverage \nof PrEP drugs, contraception, the HPV vaccine, and the \nscreenings and behavioral counseling for STDs and drug \nuse.7  They say neither they nor their families require \nsuch preventive care.8  They also claim that compul-\nsory coverage for those services violates their religious \nbeliefs by making them complicit in facilitating homo-\nsexual behavior, drug use, and sexual activity outside of \nmarriage between one man and one woman.9 \nPlaintiff Joel Miller likewise provides health cover-\nage for himself and his family.

The three individual Defendants are sued in \ntheir official capacities for their roles in enforcing the \npreventive care mandates. \n \nC. Procedural Background \nPlaintiffs\u2019 First Amended Complaint alleged several \nclaims:  (1) that the preventive care mandates violate \nArticle II\u2019s Appointments Clause; (2) the preventive \ncare mandates violate the nondelegation doctrine; (3) \nthat 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(1) violates Article II\u2019s Vest-\ning Clause; (4) the preventive care mandates, as a mat-\nter of statutory interpretation, apply only to ratings, \nrecommendations, or guidelines in place at the time \nCongress passed the ACA; and (5) that the PrEP Man-\ndate individually violates RFRA. 21   The Court dis-\nmissed Plaintiff\u200a\u2019s statutory interpretation claim for fail-\nure to state a claim and denied on the merits their Ap-\npointments Clause claim with respect to ACIP and \nHRSA and their nondelegation and Vesting Clause \nclaims.22  However, the Court granted summary judg-\nment in favor of Plaintiffs\u2019 Appointment Clause claim \n \n20 Id. \n21 First Am. Compl., ECF No. 14. \n22 Order, ECF No. 35 (denying statutory interpretation claim for \nfailure to state a claim); Mem.

The parties have briefed the issues, \nwhich are ripe for the Court\u2019s review. \nII. DISCUSSION \n \nA. Whether the Non-Braidwood Plaintiffs Have \nStanding to Press their Claims \nThe Court turns first to the question of whether the \nnon-Braidwood Plaintiffs have Article III standing such \nthat they may be granted relief on their successful \nclaims.  See Town of Chester v. Laroe Ests., Inc., 137  \nS. Ct. 1645, 1650 (2017) (requiring each plaintiff to \ndemonstrate its own Article III standing to seek and ob-\ntain each form of relief sought).  To establish Article \nIII standing, each plaintiff must set forth specific evi-\ndence showing (1) an injury-in-fact (2) that is fairly \ntraceable to the defendants\u2019 conduct, and (3) is likely to \nbe redressed by a favorable judicial decision.  Id.  An \ninjury-in-fact must be \u201cconcrete and particularized\u201d and \n\u201cactual or imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical\u201d in \nnature.  Lujan v. Defs. Of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560-\n61 (1992).  As the parties invoking federal jurisdiction, \nPlaintiffs bear the burden of proving each element of \nstanding.  Id. at 561. \n \n \n \n23 Mem. Op. 41-42, ECF No. 92. \n\n58a \n \nThe purchaser standing doctrine, developed in the \nD.C. Circuit in cases challenging government conduct, \nrecognizes Article III injury-in-fact when a plaintiff has \nbeen deprived of the opportunity to purchase a desired \nproduct due to government action.  See, e.g., Weissman \nv. Nat\u2019l R.R. Passenger Corp., 21 F.4th 854, 857-58 (D.C. \nCir. 2021); Orangeburg, S.C. v. FERC, 862 F.3d 1071, \n1077-78 (D.C. Cir. 2017); Competitive Enter. Inst. v. \nNat\u2019l Highway Traffic Safety Admin., 901 F.2d 107, \n113-14 (D.C. Cir. 1990).  Under this theory, courts have \nrecognized purchaser standing where the plaintiffs have \n\u201clost [the] opportunity to purchase a desired product  \n. . .  even if they could ameliorate the injury by pur-\nchasing some alternative product.\u201d  Orangeburg, 862 \nF.3d at 1078 (cleaned up).  However, such plaintiffs \nneed not lose all opportunity to purchase a product to \nestablish injury-in-fact.  They must simply demon-\nstrate that their choices have been \u201crestrict[ed]\u201d or that \nthere is \u201cless opportunity to purchase [the desired prod-\nuct] than would otherwise be available to them.\u201d  Com-\npetitive Enter. Inst., 901 F.2d at 112; Center for Auto \nSafety v. Nat\u2019l Highway Traffic Safety Admin., 793 \nF.2d 1322, 1332 (D.C. Cir. 1986) (emphasis added).  In \nmaking this determination, courts have focused on \nwhether the challenged government action has rendered \nthe consumer\u2019s desired product \u201cunreasonably priced\u201d \nor has made it \u201cnot readily available.\u201d  Weissman, 21 \nF.4th at 858.   \nWhile lost or diminished opportunity to purchase a \ndesired product has been the general rule for purchaser \nstanding since its inception, the D.C. Circuit\u2019s recent de-\ncision in Weissman v. National Railroad Passenger \nCorporation adds nuance to the standard.  21 F.4th at \n858-59.  In Wiessman, now the leading decision on the \n\n59a \n \ndoctrine of purchaser standing, the D.C. Circuit distin-\nguished \u201ccore features\u201d versus \u201cancillary terms\u201d of a \nparticular product, holding that would-be plaintiffs have \npurchaser standing if they can show that their desired \nproduct, \u201cdefined at a reasonable level of generality\u201d \nand \u201cdifferentiated from available alternatives by its \ncore features,\u201d is no longer available.  Id. at 859.  If \nthe desired product is only distinguishable from the \navailable alternative product \u201cby an ancillary term,\u201d \nhowever, the plaintiff has not carried its burden as to \ninjury-in-fact.  Id. \nHere, Plaintiffs rely exclusively on the doctrine of \npurchaser standing and argue that, because each of the \nnon-Braidwood Plaintiffs has been denied the oppor-\ntunity to purchase a desired product\u2014namely, health \ninsurance coverage that excludes services the would-be \nconsumers find religiously objectionable, unnecessary, \nor otherwise undesirable\u2014they have standing to press \ntheir associated claims for relief.24  Defendants attack \nPlaintiffs\u2019 reliance on purchaser standing at a theoreti-\ncal level, arguing first the doctrine is inapplicable to this \ncase because \u201cthe Fifth Circuit has never adopted the \npurchaser standing doctrine;\u201d that the doctrine is lim-\nited exclusively to the context of the Administrative Pro-\ncedure Act (APA); and, those issues aside, Plaintiffs can-\nnot satisfy the standard under Weissman anyway.25 \nAs an initial matter, that the Fifth Circuit has not ex-\npressly adopted the purchaser standing doctrine does \nnot bar its application here because neither has the Fifth \nCircuit rejected the theory.  Nor is it uncommon or im-\n \n24 Pls.\u2019 Supp. Br. 11-12, 14-15, ECF No. 98. \n25 Defs.\u2019 Resp. 5, ECF No. 99. \n\n60a \n \nproper for a district court to look to outside Circuits for \npersuasive legal authority where there is no binding \nprecedent on the issue at hand.  And despite Defend-\nants\u2019 contrary assertion, the purchaser standing doc-\ntrine need not confer standing only in cases alleging \nclaims under the APA.  Indeed, as Defendants con-\ncede, the Weissman decision does not expressly fore-\nclose the doctrine\u2019s application beyond the APA con-\ntext.26  See Weissman, 21 F.4th at 859 (noting that the \nCircuit \u201chas assumed\u201d purchaser standing applies only \nin the APA context but theorizing that it \u201ccould apply \nbeyond that context\u201d).  The Court knows of no compel-\nling reason to impose more stringent rules of standing \nwhen a plaintiff brings an APA claim as opposed to any \nother sort of claim, and Defendants offer none.  There-\nfore, provided they satisfy purchaser standing as the \nD.C. Circuit has articulated it, the Court finds no reason \nto deny the Plaintiffs standing on this basis.27 \nThe religious objector Plaintiffs attest that they want \nthe option to purchase health insurance\u2014for them-\nselves, their families, or their employees\u2014that excludes \ncoverage of preventive care such as PrEP drugs, the \nHPV vaccine, contraceptives, and screenings and behav-\n \n26 Id. \n27 Plaintiffs suggest that the Court should decline to follow Weiss-\nman on grounds that the decision is an anomaly, departing from \ndecades of D.C. Circuit and Supreme Court precedent with its core \nfeature-versus-ancillary term distinction.  Pls.\u2019 Reply 6-7, ECF \nNo. 111.  While it may be true that Weissman substantially amends \nthe rule of purchaser standing, that case is the Circuit\u2019s leading \ndecision on the doctrine.  And given no controlling authority within \nthe Fifth Circuit, the Court is unwilling to depart from that same \nCircuit\u2019s most recent precedential decision on the subject. \n\n61a \n \nioral counseling for STDs and drug use.28  Each claims \nthat the preventive care mandates requiring compulsory \ncoverage for those services violates their religious be-\nliefs by making them complicit in facilitating homosex-\nual behavior, drug use, and sexual activity outside of \nmarriage between one man and one woman as a condi-\ntion of purchasing health insurance.29 \nBy contrast, the non-religious objector Plaintiffs, as \nwell as those who object to the preventive care mandates \non religious grounds, claim injury based on their inabil-\nity to purchase insurance that excludes or imposes co-\npays or deductibles for preventive care services they do \nnot want or need, resulting in higher monthly premi-\nums.30  Plaintiffs claim this denial of choice is a distinct \ninjury from the inability to purchase insurance that is \nviolative of one\u2019s sincerely held religious beliefs.31 \nDefendants do not contest that the religious objector \nPlaintiffs\u2019 Hobson\u2019s choice between purchasing health \ninsurance that includes religiously objectionable ser-\nvices or forgoing conventional health insurance alto-\ngether is an injury-in-fact.  And such an argument \nwould be meritless.  See March for Life v. Burwell, 128 \nF. Supp. 3d 116, 128-29 (D.D.C. 2015) (\u201cThe employee \nplaintiffs have demonstrated that the [Contraceptive] \nMandate substantially burdens their sincere exercise of \nreligion  . . .

Instead, Defendants argue that these \nplaintiffs suffer no real injury as a result of the preven-\ntive care mandates because they do not currently par-\nticipate in the health care market and that they opted \nout of the insurance market for reasons other than the \nmandates, namely, the cost of coverage.32  But each of \nthese arguments fail. \nFirst, the Plaintiffs need not act to violate their sin-\ncerely held religious convictions by  purchasing a prod-\nuct they believe would make them complicit in objection-\nable conduct just to obtain standing.  Defendants\u2019 con-\ntrary assertion is both illogical and legally incorrect.  \nRather, Plaintiffs need only show their opportunity to \npurchase their desired product, as defined by its core \nfeatures, has been reduced or eliminated.

It is undisputed that health insurance com-\npanies stopped selling insurance plans excluding the ob-\njectionable coverage in response to the preventive care \nmandates.  As a result, these Plaintiffs lost access to \nhealth insurance plans they could purchase without re-\nligious objection.  Thus, religious objector Plaintiffs \nhave made the necessary showing here.33 \n \n32 Defs.\u2019 Resp. 3-5, ECF No. 99; Defs.\u2019 Reply 2-7, ECF No. 112. \n33 See notes 7 and 29 supra. \n\n63a \n \nThe fact that Plaintiffs Kelley and Starnes utilize \nChristian bill-sharing does not negate this cognizable in-\njury.  See Orangeburg, 862 F.3d at 1078 (cleaned up) \n(noting that \u201clost opportunity to purchase a desired \nproduct [is sufficient to demonstrate injury-in-fact]  \n. . .  even if [plaintiffs] could ameliorate the injury by \npurchasing some alternative product\u201d).  Nor does this \nstandard require Plaintiffs to prove that they would, in \nfact, purchase conventional health insurance if the pre-\nventive care mandates were lifted.34  As discussed, Plain-\ntiffs are suffering a cognizable injury now through their \ncurrent inability to purchase conventional health insur-\nance that excludes the objectionable coverage.35  And \nDefendants have not offered any decision indicating that \npurchaser standing plaintiffs must evince a commit-\nment, rather than a desire, to purchase the product in \nquestion.36 \nSecond, Defendants argue that several of the reli-\ngious objector Plaintiffs cannot demonstrate standing \nbecause in their verified responses to requests for ad-\nmissions, they indicated they stopped purchasing health \ninsurance \u201cbecause it was too expensive,\u201d not because of \nthe preventive care mandates. 37   Defendants argue \nthat under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 36, the \nCourt must accept these statements as \u201cconclusively es-\ntablished.\u201d38  FED.

While Defendants \n \n34 Defs.\u2019 Resp. 4, ECF No. 99. \n35 For this reason, the Court need not address whether the Plain-\ntiffs\u2019 late-coming declarations are permissible to support their as-\nsertions of standing. \n36 See Defs.\u2019 Reply 4-6, ECF No. 111. \n37 Defs.\u2019 Resp. 3, ECF No. 99; Defs.\u2019 Reply 2-3, ECF No. 111. \n38 Defs.\u2019 Reply 2-3, ECF No. 111. \n\n64a \n \nare correct about the conclusive nature of the responses, \nthey are wrong that the Court must accept them as the \n\u201ccomplete and sufficient basis for [the plaintiffs\u2019] deci-\nsion to stop purchasing health insurance.\u201d39  The lan-\nguage of Rule 36(b) does not compel this result and De-\nfendants cite no authority to support the proposition \nthat the responses must be read as the exclusive basis \nfor Plaintiffs\u2019 decisions.  Reading the statements in \ncontext supports this conclusion.  Importantly, Defen-\ndants\u2019 requests for admission addressed solely whether \nPlaintiffs could quantify the impact of the mandates on \ntheir insurance premiums.40  Plaintiffs responded that \nthey could not quantify the increased costs, but that \nthey knew their premiums had become too expensive to \nafford.41  Their discussion of costs is a natural result of \nDefendants\u2019 targeted questions about premiums.42  As \nsuch, the Court finds no reason to deny standing on this \nbasis. \nThe only remaining issue related to this element of \nthe standing inquiry is whether the preventive care \nmandates to which the non-Braidwood Plaintiffs object \nare \u201ccore features\u201d or merely \u201cancillary terms.\u201d  In \nWeissman, the D.C.

J. 181-222, \n277-96, ECF No. 65. \n41 See note 40 supra. \n42 Of course, had Plaintiffs offered this same response to a broad \nquestion about why they stopped purchasing insurance, and later \ntried to back away from that answer in their pleadings, Rule 36 \nwould compel a different result.  But the specific cost-based ques-\ntions in Defendants\u2019 requests for admission are important context. \n\n65a \n \nplaintiffs did not have purchaser standing because they \nhad no cognizable interest in contracting to purchase \ntrain tickets without being subject to a binding arbitra-\ntion provision.  Weissman, 21 F.4th at 859.  The court \nconcluded that the purchasers had \u201cadequately alleged \na \u2018primary,\u2019 concrete consumer interest in traveling on \nAmtrak, but not in purchasing an Amtrak ticket without \nan arbitration provision.\u201d  Id. at 860.  In other words, \nthe arbitration provision was merely ancillary to the de-\nsired product defined at a reasonable level of generality \n\u2014namely, a train ticket. \nDefendants argue that, here, the objectionable pre-\nventive care coverages are merely ancillary terms and \nthat \u201cwhatever precise features of health insurance may \nbe \u2018core\u2019 to Plaintiffs, they continue to have access to \nhealth insurance that includes those features, and thus \ndo not have standing under the \u2018purchaser standing\u2019 the-\nory.\u201d43  The Court agrees in part.  Defendants\u2019 argu-\nment is true as to the non-religious objector Plaintiffs, \nwho would like to purchase health insurance without the \nunwanted an unnecessary preventive care services and \nassociated copays or deductibles but otherwise retain \naccess to conventional healthcare.  Indeed, these Plain-\ntiffs are current participants in the health insurance \nmarket and, by all appearances, are not prevented from \nretaining it for their personal or business needs on ac-\ncount of expense. 44  The Weissman court offered no \nguidance about where the line between \u201ccore features\u201d \nand \u201cancillary terms\u201d is to be drawn.  But wherever \nthat line may be, that the non-religious objector Plain-\ntiffs may still\u2014and indeed do\u2014purchase conventional \n \n43 Defs.\u2019 Reply 10, ECF No. 111. \n44 Pls.\u2019 App. 45-48, 62-65, ECF No. 46. \n\n66a \n \nhealth insurance despite its inclusion of preventive care \ncoverage suggests the features are merely ancillary. \nThe same argument cannot be made for the religious-\nobjector Plaintiffs.  These Plaintiffs, who do not cur-\nrently and are unwilling to purchase health insurance \nthat includes the preventive care coverage, find those \nservices objectionable enough to forgo conventional \nhealth insurance altogether.  Though the Court does \nnot suggest that a decision not to purchase, without \nmore, would be enough to determine whether a feature \nis \u201ccore,\u201d a decision not to purchase based on one\u2019s reli-\ngious convictions certainly meets the criteria.  In \nshort, these Plaintiffs have a cognizable interest in being \nable to purchase a product that does not obligate them \nto violate their religious beliefs.  Though the Govern-\nment may disagree with those beliefs, it is no position to \ndictate whether the Plaintiffs\u2019 interests in adhering to \ntheir religious convictions is a core or merely ancillary \ncomponent of their decision to abstain.  Thus, the reli-\ngious objector Plaintiffs have carried their burden to \ndemonstrate injury-in-fact based on a theory of pur-\nchaser standing. \nThe remaining two elements for Article III standing \n\u2014traceability and redressability\u2014are relatively straight-\nforward.  Plaintiffs \u201cmust satisfy the \u2018causation\u2019 and \n\u2018redressability\u2019 prongs of the Art. III minima by show-\ning that the injury \u2018fairly can be traced to the challenged \naction\u2019 and \u2018is likely to be redressed by a favorable deci-\nsion.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Whitmore v. Arkansas, 495 U.S. 149, 155 \n(1990).  When a plaintiff suffers injury as the object of \nthe challenged government action, \u201cthere is ordinarily \nlittle question that the action  . . .  has caused him in-\njury, and that a judgment preventing  . . .  the action \n\n67a \n \nwill redress it.\u201d  Lujan, 504 U.S. at 561-62.  And in-\ndeed, there is little doubt that Plaintiffs\u2019 injuries\u2014 \nincurred through PSTF\u2019s ratings operating in conjunc-\ntion with 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13\u2014are fairly traceable to \nDefendants\u2019 enforcement of the preventive care man-\ndates.  Nor is it contested that the forms of relief \nsought would likely redress the Plaintiffs\u2019 injuries.  \nMoreover, the proliferation of short-term, limited dura-\ntion insurance (STLDI) plans in response to Congress\u2019s \nexempting them from the ACA requirements adds fur-\nther support to these elements.45  That insurance com-\npanies are offering STLDI plans without preventive \ncare coverage when not legally required to do so indi-\ncates that the restricted options in the conventional \nmarket are at least partly attributable to the Govern-\nment\u2019s enforcement of the mandates.  Thus, it is rea-\nsonable to conclude that if Defendants are broadly en-\njoined from enforcing these mandates, the conventional \nhealth insurance market may respond similarly to the \nSTLDI market, meaning Plaintiffs\u2019 injuries would likely \nbe redressed by a favorable decision. \n*  *  *  *  \nIn sum, the religious objector Plaintiffs have demon-\nstrated standing and are entitled to press their claims \nfor relief.  Non-religious objector Plaintiffs Joel Miller \nand Gregory Scheideman have not made this showing. \nGiven these conclusions, and the Court\u2019s prior determi-\nnation that 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(4) does not violate \nthe Appointments Clause with respect to HRSA, the \nCourt DISMISSES with prejudice the religious objector \nPlaintiffs\u2019 contraceptive mandate claims and shall enter \n \n45 Pls.\u2019 App 176, ECF No. 46. \n\n68a \n \nsummary judgment in favor of Defendants as to this \nclaim.

Stephens, 822 F.3d 776, 782-83 \n(5th Cir. 2016) (cleaned up) (interpreting RLUIPA).48  If \nPlaintiffs carry that burden, the government \u201cmay sub-\nstantially burden a person\u2019s exercise of religion only if \nit demonstrates that application of the burden to the \nperson (1) is in furtherance of a compelling governmen-\ntal interest; and (2) is the least restrictive means of fur-\nthering that compelling governmental interest.\u201d  42 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 2000bb-1(b) (emphases added). \nAs it does with Braidwood, the PrEP mandate sub-\nstantially burdens the religious exercise of the remain-\ning non-Braidwood Plaintiffs.

It is undis-\nputed that putting individuals to this choice imposes a \nsubstantial burden on religious exercise.  See Burwell \nv.

Though Defend-\nants contest the parties\u2019 success on the merits, they do \nnot dispute that successful Plaintiffs are entitled to \nparty-specific declaratory and injunctive relief.\n55  \nThus, the final issue before the Court is what relief the \nPlaintiffs are entitled to for their success on the merits \nof their Appointments Clause claim as it pertains to \nPSTF. \nPlaintiffs argue Braidwood, and the other religious \nobjector Plaintiffs who have demonstrated Article III \nstanding, is entitled to a universal remedy under the \nAPA \u201cset[ting] aside\u201d every agency action taken to im-\nplement or enforce the preventive care recommenda-\ntions (made compulsory through operation of 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 300gg-13(a)(1)) of the unconstitutionally appointed \nTask Force since March 23, 2010.56  See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A).  \nDefendants object to this proposal and claim that, at \nmost, Plaintiffs are entitled to targeted relief that per-\nmits the Court to sever the unconstitutional portions of \n \n55 See Defs.\u2019 Resp. 15 n.5, 20, ECF No. 99. \n56 Pls.\u2019 Supp. Br. 8, ECF No. 98; Pls.\u2019 Reply 16, ECF No. 111. \n\n73a \n \nthe ACA, but not vacate the unlawful agency actions.57  \nAlternatively, Defendants concede declaratory and in-\njunctive relief that specifically addresses the prevailing \nparties\u2019 injuries is permissible.58  Because the parties \nagree that the latter forms of relief are appropriate, \nhere the Court will address only whether Plaintiffs are \nentitled to a universal remedy that prevents Defendants \nfrom enforcing the disputed coverage mandates against \nanyone, or only against the Plaintiffs to this dispute who \nhave demonstrated Article III standing. \nThe first question is whether the APA permits vaca-\ntur of the unlawful agency actions taken to implement \nor enforce PSTF\u2019s constitutionally infirm preventive \ncare mandates.  It does.  Data Mktg.

The next question is whether \nvacatur is permissible here.  It is.  While Defendants \nraise a host of challenges to this conclusion, each is una-\nvailing.   \nThe Court begins with the text of the relevant stat-\nute, \u00a7 706(2) of the APA, which authorizes courts to \n\u201chold unlawful and set aside agency action\u201d that the \ncourt finds to be \u201cnot in accordance with law\u201d or \u201ccon-\ntrary to constitutional [] power.\u201d  5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A)-\n(B).

And the au-\nthority Defendants cite to suggest that courts may \nchoose whether to vacate agency action is inapplicable in \nthis case because this Court has no option to remand the \nsubject statute or contested implementation or enforce-\nment action to a responsible agency.  Defendants cite \nCentral and South West Services, Inc. v. U.S. EPA to \nsupport the proposition that this Court may decline to \nvacate the unlawful agency action.60  220 F.3d 683, 692 \n(5th Cir. 2000).

Id. at 690-92, 702.  Because the \nCourt has nothing to remand here, that decision is inapt. \nThat the Plaintiffs did not prevail on an APA claim is \nno bar to the remedy they seek.  The Court\u2019s prior \nOpinion makes clear that this case involves government \naction the Court has found to be \u201cnot in accordance with \nlaw\u201d or \u201ccontrary to constitutional [] power.\u201d  5 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 706(2)(A)-(B); Braidwood Mgmt., 2022 WL 4091215, at \n*12-13, 20 (holding that the statutory scheme that gives \nPSTF\u2019s recommended ratings the force and effect of law \nviolates Braidwood\u2019s rights under RFRA and Article \nII\u2019s Appointments Clause).

But Plaintiffs did successfully challenge \nthe constitutionality of the statute that gives PSTF\u2019s \nrecommendations the force and effect of law. \nAs Plaintiffs assert, \u201ca challenge to the constitution-\nality of a statute necessarily encompasses a challenge to \nevery agency action taken to implement [or enforce] the \nunconstitutional command.\u201d63  The Court agrees.  And \nthe Fifth Circuit recently affirmed a conceptually simi-\nlar notion.  See Franciscan Alliance, Inc. v. Becerra, \n47 F.4th 368, 378 (5th Cir. 2022) (\u201cHHS implicitly argues \nthat a lawsuit challenging a regulation and a lawsuit \nchallenging the underlying statute are different.  But  \n. . .  a challenge to an agency regulation is necessarily \na challenge to the underlying statute as well.\u201d) (empha-\nsis added).  An attack on the underlying statute would \nthen logically present an attack on the executive actions \ntaken pursuant to that statute.  Thus, every executive \naction taken to implement or enforce PSTF\u2019s recom-\nmended ratings, by HHS or any other agency, are as \nconstitutionally invalid as the authorizing statutory pro-\nvision.  Additionally, the only remedy that could re-\nlieve Plaintiffs\u2019 injury is one directed at the agencies \ntasked with implementing and enforcing the unconstitu-\ntional statute, since courts have no authority to order \nCongress to cure its statutory deficiency.

Braidwood Mgmt., 2022 WL 4091215, at *10. \nThis constitutionally infirm statutory creation is \u201cnot in \naccordance with law\u201d and makes the issuance of their \nrecommendations \u201ccontrary to constitutional [] power.\u201d  \n5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A)-(B).  And, as discussed, Plaintiffs\u2019 \nchallenge to the \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(1) logically includes a \nchallenge to the executive actions taken pursuant to that \nstatute.  Thus, any agency actions taken to implement \nand enforce the corresponding preventive care man-\ndates are necessarily \u201cnot in accordance with law\u201d and \nmay be \u201cset aside.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 706. \nNor are Defendants prejudiced by Plaintiffs\u2019 re-\nquested relief.  In passing, Defendants suggest that \nPlaintiffs\u2019 proposing vacatur as a remedy at this stage of \nlitigation presents notice and due process concerns. 70  \nBut Defendants have been on notice that Plaintiffs were \nseeking a universal remedy since they filed their Amended \nComplaint.  Throughout, Plaintiffs repeatedly ex-\npressed their intent to obtain broad relief: \nThe Court should therefore declare that any and all \npreventive-care mandates based on a rating, recom-\nmendation, or guideline issued by the U.S. Preven-\ntive Services Task Force, the Advisory Committee on \nImmunization Practices, or the Health Resources \nand Services Administration after March 23, 2010\u2014\nthe date on which the Affordable Care Act was signed \ninto law\u2014are unconstitutional and unenforceable, \n \n70 Defs.\u2019 Resp. 12, ECF No. 99. \n\n79a \n \nand it should permanently enjoin the defendants \nfrom enforcing them.71 \n[T]he Court should enjoin the defendants from en-\nforcing any preventive-care mandate derived from an \nagency rating, recommendation, or guideline that is-\nsued after March 23, 2010.72 \n[The Court should] permanently enjoin the defend-\nants from enforcing any coverage mandate based \nupon an agency rating, recommendation, or guideline \nthat issued after March 23, 2010.73 \n[And the Court should] award all other relief that the \nCourt deems just, proper, or equitable.74 \nThis was sufficient to provide Defendants fair notice of \nthe type of relief Plaintiffs were seeking for their Ap-\npointments Clause claim.  Moreover, Defendants have \nbeen given ample opportunity\u2014a response and sur-reply \n\u2014to fully brief the propriety of vacatur at the remedies \nstage. \nBeyond the statutory scheme and Rule 54, there is \nsome authority that suggests courts possess a degree of \ninherent authority to provide the remedies that Plain-\ntiffs seek here.  See Collins v. Yellen, 141 S. Ct. 1761, \n1799 (2021) (Gorsuch, J., concurring) (\u201cWhether uncon-\nstitutionally installed or improperly unsupervised, offi-\ncials cannot wield executive power except as Article II \nprovides.

Collins v. Yellen, 141 S.

Such a remedy finds support \nin precedent.\u201d) (emphasis added) (internal citations \nomitted).  Though these hints do not resolve every \nquestion presented here, they provide some support for \nthe Court\u2019s conclusion that it may grant the relief the \nPlaintiffs have requested in this case. \nFinally, a universal remedy is appropriate because \nDefendants\u2019 alternative remedial proposal\u2014severing \nthe statutory provision that purportedly gives rise to the \nappointment problem\u2014will not cure Plaintiffs\u2019 injuries.  \nRather than vacating the agency actions implementing \nor enforcing PSTF\u2019s recommendations, Defendants \nurge the Court to sever 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(6).75  This \nsection provides that PSTF\u2019s rating recommendations \n\u201cshall be independent and, to the extent practicable, not \nsubject to political pressure.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(6).  \n\u201cSevering\u201d or singly making this provision unenforcea-\nble would permit the Secretary of HHS to review and \napprove the Task Force\u2019s recommendations, Defend-\nants say, curing the Appointments Clause problem with-\nout unnecessarily disrupting the ACA\u2019s overarching \n \n75 Defs.\u2019 Resp. 8-10, ECF No. 99. \n\n81a \n \nstatutory scheme.76  But Defendants\u2019 assertion is wrong \nfor several reasons. \nFirst, by Defendants own admission, PSTF is not part \nof HHS or any federal agency and is not, therefore, au-\ntomatically subject to the Secretary\u2019s \u201csupervision and \ndirection\u201d as are ACIP and HRSA.  42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 202, \n243, 247b.77  For this reason, the Supreme Court\u2019s de-\ncision in United States v. Arthrex, Inc. is inapplicable.  \n141 S. Ct. 1970 (2021) (curing appointment problem by \nordering every administrative patent judge\u2019s decision to \nbe subject to the review of the PTO Director).  Even  \nif it is assumed for the sake of argument that PSTF  \nwere subject to the Secretary\u2019s oversight, severing  \n\u00a7 299b-4(a)(6) might permit the Secretary to authorize \nor reject PSTF\u2019s recommendations post hoc but it would \nnot compel him to take such action.  Moreover,  \n\u00a7 300gg-13(a)(1) would still operate to give PSTF\u2019s rat-\nings the force and effect of law unless and until the Sec-\nretary decided to ratify or veto a particular recommen-\ndation. \nMoreover, Fifth Circuit and Supreme Court prece-\ndent indicate that, given the particular constitutional vi-\nolation at issue here, vacatur is the appropriate remedy \nfor Plaintiffs\u2019 injury.  In fact, the line of decisions from \nthe Fifth Circuit and Supreme Court, which Defendants \nsay rejects Plaintiffs\u2019 remedial position, is more properly \nread to support it.78  See generally Collins v. Mnuchin, \n \n76 Id. at 10. \n77 Defs.\u2019 Mot. for Summ. J. 40, ECF No. 64; Mem.

In Mnuchin, the en banc and \nclosely divided Fifth Circuit considered the proper rem-\nedy for a restriction on removal that violated Article II. \nMnuchin, 938 F.3d at 591.  Ultimately the court con-\ncluded that the appropriate remedy was to sever the \n\u201cfor cause\u201d provision, thus curing the unconstitutional \nremoval restriction.  Id. at 595.  But that case is dis-\ntinguishable from this one for an obvious reason:  that \ndecision involved a Removal Clause violation, not an Ap-\npointments Clause violation.  And the Mnuchin court \nexpressly noted the difference.  Id. at 593 (\u201c[T]he \nCourt has invalidated [and vacated] actions taken by in-\ndividuals who were not properly appointed under the \nConstitution.

All agency action taken to imple-\nment or enforce the preventive care coverage require-\nments in response to an \u201cA\u201d or \u201cB\u201d recommendation by \nthe U.S. Preventive Services Task Force on or after \nMarch 23, 2010 and made compulsory under 42 U.S.C.  \n\u00a7 300gg-13(a)(1) are HELD unlawful as violative of the \nAppointments Clause.  The Court ORDERS that such \nagency actions are VACATED and Defendants and their \nofficers, agents, servants, and employees are EN-\nJOINED from implementing or enforcing 42 U.S.C.  \n\u00a7 300gg-13(a)(1)\u2019s compulsory coverage requirements in \nresponse to an \u201cA\u201d or \u201cB\u201d rating from the Task Force in \nthe future. \nFurther, under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2201, the Court HOLDS \nthat agency action taken to implement or enforce the \npreventive care mandates in response to an \u201cA\u201d or \u201cB\u201d \nrecommendation by the U.S. Preventive Services Task \nForce on or after March 23, 2010 and made compulsory \nunder 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(1) are unlawful as viola-\ntive of the Appointments Clause.  Braidwood Manage-\nment Inc. and Kelley Orthodontics, and to the extent ap-\nplicable, individual Plaintiffs need not comply with the \npreventive care coverage recommendations of the U.S. \nPreventive Services Task Force issued on or after \nMarch 23, 2010, because the members of the Task Force \nhave not been appointed in a manner consistent with Ar-\nticle II\u2019s Appointments Clause.  Accordingly, the \nCourt ENJOINS Defendants and their officers, agents, \nservants, and employees from implementing or enforc-\ning the same against these Plaintiffs. \n \n \n\n84a \n \nIII.

Having con-\nsidered the motions, arguments, and applicable law, the \nCourt ORDERS that motions are GRANTED in part and \nDENIED in part. \n \n \n\n86a \n \nI. \nBACKGROUND \nA. \nThe Law \nThe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act \n(\u201cACA\u201d) requires most private health insurance to cover \ncertain \u201cpreventive care.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13.  Spe-\ncifically, group health plans and health insurance issuers \nmust \u201cprovide coverage for and shall not impose any \ncost sharing requirements for\u201d four categories of pre-\nventive care.  Id.  The ACA empowers three agencies \naffiliated with the Department of Health and Human \nServices (\u201cHHS\u201d) to determine what services fall within \nthose four categories.  Id. \nFirst, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (\u201cPSTF\u201d) \nrecommends \u201cevidence-based items or services that \nhave in effect a rating of \u2018A\u2019 or \u2018B.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Id. \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(1).  \nSecond, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Prac-\ntices (\u201cACIP\u201d) recommends certain immunizations.  \nId. \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(2).  Third, the Health Resources and \nServices Administration (\u201cHRSA\u201d) issues \u201ccomprehen-\nsive guidelines\u201d with respect to infants, children, and ad-\nolescents for \u201cevidence-informed preventive care and \nscreenings.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(3).  And fourth, HRSA \nissues \u201ccomprehensive guidelines\u201d with respect to women \nfor \u201csuch additional preventive care and screenings\u201d not \ncovered under \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(1).  Id. \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(4).  \nPrivate health insurance must cover the services identi-\nfied by the three agencies under these categories.1  Id. \n\u00a7 300gg-13(a). \n \n \n \n1  The Court refers to \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(1) through (a)(4) collectively \nas the \u201cpreventive-care mandates.\u201d \n\n87a \n \n \n1. \nPSTF \nPSTF is a body of volunteers \u201cwith appropriate ex-\npertise\u201d to make healthcare recommendations.  42 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(1).  The Director of the Agency for \nHealthcare Research and Quality (\u201cAHRQ\u201d), an agency \nwithin HHS, \u201cconvene[s]\u201d PSTF.  Id.  The purpose of \nPSTF is to \u201creview the scientific evidence related to the \neffectiveness, appropriateness, and cost-effectiveness of \nclinical preventive services for the purpose of develop-\ning recommendations for the health care community, \nand updating previous clinical preventive recommenda-\ntions.\u201d  Id.  By statute, PSTF and its members \u201cshall \nbe independent and, to the extent practicable, not sub-\nject to political pressure.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(6). \nIn 2019, PSTF recommended pre-exposure prophy-\nlaxis (\u201cPrEP\u201d) drugs to prevent HIV infection.  See \nDefs.\u2019 App. 385, ECF No. 65.  PSTF issued an \u201cA\u201d rec-\nommendation for PrEP drugs for individuals who are at \nhigh risk of HIV acquisition, which meant that health \ninsurance plans must cover PrEP drugs under 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 300gg-13(a)(1).  See Pls.\u2019 App. 12, ECF No. 46.  The \nregulations delayed implementation of the coverage un-\ntil June 2020.  See 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 147.130(b)(1). \n \n2. \nACIP \nThe HHS Secretary created ACIP as an advisory \ncouncil under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 217a(a) to provide guidance to \nHHS on vaccines.  See Defs.\u2019 App. 152, ECF No. 65.  \nACIP reports to the Director of the Centers for Disease \nControl and Prevention (\u201cCDC\u201d), who exercises dele-\ngated authority from the HHS Secretary.  See id. (first \nciting 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 243; and then citing id. \u00a7 247b).  A \nvaccine recommendation from ACIP \u201cis considered in \n\n88a \n \neffect after it has been adopted by the Director of the \n[CDC].\u201d  45 C.F.R. \u00a7 147.130(a)(1)(ii).  Once the CDC \nDirector adopts a vaccine recommendation, ACIP pub-\nlishes the recommendation in a weekly report.  See \nDefs.\u2019 App. 152, ECF No. 65. \nACIP recommends the HPV vaccine to prevent new \nHPV infections and HPV-associated diseases, including \nsome cancers.  In 2007, ACIP began recommending \nthe HPV vaccine for females ages eleven to twelve.  See \nCDC, Quadrivalent Human Papillomavirus Vaccine:  \nRecommendations of the Advisory Committee on Im-\nmunization Practices (ACIP) (Mar. 23, 2007), https:// \nwww.cdc.gov/mmwr/PDF/rr/rr5602.pdf.  ACIP currently \nrecommends the HPV vaccine for all children ages \neleven to twelve, plus various catch-up vaccination plans \nfor older populations.  See Elissa Meites et al., Human \nPapillomavirus Vaccination for Adults:  Updated \nRecommendations of the Advisory Committee on Im-\nmunization Practices (Aug. 16, 2019), https://www.cdc. \ngov/mmwr/volumes/68/wr/pdfs/mm6832a3-H.pdf.  Health \ninsurance plans must cover the HPV vaccine under 42 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(2). \n \n3. \nHRSA \nThe HHS Secretary created HRSA to provide direc-\ntion to programs and activities within HHS.  See \nHealth Resources and Services Administration; State-\nment of Organization, Functions, and Delegations of Au-\nthority, 47 Fed. Reg. 38,409 (Aug. 31, 1982).  HRSA is \ndirected by an Administrator who reports to the Assis-\ntant Secretary of HHS.  Id. at 38,410.  The HRSA Ad-\nministrator, like the CDC Director, is a non-career po-\nlitical appointee whose employment may be terminated \n\n89a \n \nby the agency at any time.  See 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 317.605; \nDefs.\u2019 App. 42, ECF No. 65. \nIn 2010, HRSA promulgated a series of comprehen-\nsive guidelines for infants, children, and adolescents.  \nThe guidelines include counseling for alcohol abuse, \nscreening and behavioral counseling for sexually trans-\nmitted infections, screening and behavior interventions \nfor obesity, and counseling for tobacco use.  See In-\nterim Final Rules for Group Health Plans and Health \nInsurance Issuers Relating to Coverage of Preventive \nServices Under the Patient Protection and Affordable \nCare Act, 75 Fed. Reg. 41,726, 47,740-55 (July 19, 2010).  \n\u201c[A] recommendation or guideline in the comprehensive \nguidelines supported by HRSA is considered to be is-\nsued on the date on which it is accepted by the Adminis-\ntrator of HRSA or, if applicable, adopted by the Secre-\ntary of HHS.\u201d  Coverage of Certain Preventive Services \nUnder the Affordable Care Act, 80 Fed. Reg. 41,318, \n41,322 (July 14, 2015). \nIn 2011, HRSA promulgated additional guidelines re-\nquiring nonexempt employers to cover \u201c[a]ll Food and \nDrug Administration [(FDA)] approved contraceptive \nmethods, sterilization procedures, and patient education \nand counseling for all women with reproductive capac-\nity.\u201d  RIN 1545-BJ60, 77 Fed. Reg. 8,725, 8,725 & n.1 \n(Feb. 15, 2012) (citation and internal quotation marks \nomitted).  Those guidelines became known as the con-\ntraceptive mandate.  See Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, \nInc., 573 U.S. 682 (2014).  Health insurance plans must \ncover the services recommended by HRSA under 42 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(3) and (a)(4). \n \n\n90a \n \nB. \nThe Parties \nPlaintiffs are six individuals and two businesses who \nchallenge the legality of the preventive-care mandates \nunder the Constitution and the Religious Freedom Res-\ntoration Act (\u201cRFRA\u201d).  Each Plaintiff wishes to ob-\ntain or provide health insurance that excludes or limits \ncoverage currently required by the preventive-care man-\ndates.  They object to the services required by the  \npreventive-care mandates for a mixture of religious and \neconomic reasons. \nPlaintiffs John Kelley, Joel Starnes, Zach Maxwell, \nand Ashley Maxwell provide health coverage for them-\nselves and their families.  They want the option to pur-\nchase health insurance that excludes or limits coverage \nof PrEP drugs, contraception, the HPV vaccine, and the \nscreenings and behavioral counseling for STDs and drug \nuse.  See Pls.\u2019 App. 35-37, 41-43, 52-54, 58-60, ECF No. \n46. They say neither they nor their families require such \npreventive care.  Id.  They also claim that compulsory \ncoverage for those services violates their religious be-\nliefs by making them complicit in facilitating homosex-\nual behavior, drug use, and sexual activity outside of \nmarriage between one man and one woman.  Id. at 38, \n44, 53, 59. \nPlaintiff Joel Miller likewise provides health cover-\nage for himself and his family.  Like the other Plain-\ntiffs, Miller wants the option to purchase health insur-\nance that excludes or limits coverage of preventive care \nthat \u201che does not want or need.\u201d  Id. at 66-67.  Miller\u2019s \nwife \u201cis past her childbearing years,\u201d and neither he nor \nhis family members \u201cengage in the behaviors that makes \n[sic] this preventive treatment necessary.\u201d  Id. at 67. \n\n91a \n \nPlaintiff Gregory Scheideman provides health cover-\nage for himself, his family, and the employees of his \ncompany, Fort Worth Oral Surgery.  Scheideman \nwants the option to purchase health insurance that ex-\ncludes or limits coverage of services currently required \nby the preventive-care mandates.  Id. at 47-49.  \nScheideman says neither he nor his family members re-\nquire such preventive care.  Id. at 48-50.  In addition, \nScheideman and his business partners do not want to \ncover such care for their employees.  Id. \nPlaintiff Kelley Orthodontics provides health insur-\nance for its employees.  Kelley Orthodontics is a Chris-\ntian professional association that wishes to provide \nhealth insurance for its employees that excludes cover-\nage of preventive care such as contraceptives and PrEP \ndrugs.  Id. at 39.  Plaintiff John Kelley, the owner of \nKelley Orthodontics, says that providing such coverage \nviolates his religious beliefs.  Id. \nPlaintiff Braidwood Management Inc. is a Christian \nfor-profit corporation owned by Steven Hotze.  Id. at \n69.  Braidwood provides health insurance to its approx-\nimately seventy employees through a self-insured plan, \nand Hotze wishes to provide health insurance for Braid-\nwood\u2019s employees that excludes coverage of preventive \ncare such as contraceptives and PrEP drugs.  Id. at 70-\n71.  Hotze, like Plaintiffs Kelley, Starnes, and the Max-\nwells, objects to coverage of those services on religious \ngrounds.  Id. at 72-73.  Hotze also wants the option to im-\npose copays or deductibles for preventive care in Braid-\nwood\u2019s self-insured plan.  Id. at 70, 73.  Plaintiffs ar-\ngue that Defendants\u2019 enforcement of the preventive-\ncare mandates limits their ability to obtain or provide \ninsurance that excludes their unwanted coverage. \n\n92a \n \nDefendants are the Secretary of HHS, Xavier \nBecerra; the Secretary of the Treasury, Janet Yellen; \nthe Secretary of Labor, Martin Walsh; and the United \nStates.  The three individual Defendants are sued in \ntheir official capacities for their roles in enforcing the \npreventive-care mandates. \nC. \nThe Litigation \nPlaintiffs\u2019 First Amended Complaint asserts five \nclaims.  Plaintiffs allege that (1) the preventive-care \nmandates violate the Appointments Clause; (2) the pre-\nventive-care mandates violate the nondelegation doc-\ntrine; (3) 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(1) violates the Vesting \nClause; (4) the preventive-care mandates, as a matter of \nstatutory interpretation, apply only to ratings, recom-\nmendations, or guidelines in place at the time Congress \npassed the ACA; and (5) the PrEP mandate violates \nRFRA.  See 1st Am. Compl., ECF No. 14.  The Court \ndismissed Plaintiffs\u2019 statutory interpretation claim for \nfailure to state a claim, and it dismissed Plaintiffs\u2019 reli-\ngious objections to the contraceptive mandate as barred \nby res judicata.2  See Order, ECF No. 35. \nPlaintiffs moved for summary judgment on the re-\nmaining claims.  See Pls.\u2019 Summ. J. Mot., ECF No. 44.  \nDefendants responded and cross-moved for summary \njudgment.  See ECF Nos. 62, 63.  Defendants argue \n \n2  Plaintiffs\u2019 lawsuit in DeOtte v. Nevada, No. 4:18-cv-00825, \nbarred their claims against the contraceptive mandate in this case. \nSee Order 12-16, ECF No. 35.  On August 31, 2022, the Court dis-\nmissed DeOtte as moot in accordance with the Fifth Circuit\u2019s man-\ndate issued that day.  See Order, ECF No. 118, Case No. 4:18-cv-\n00825.  In light of the judgment in DeOtte, Plaintiffs now wish to \npursue their claims against the contraceptive mandate in this case.  \nSee Not. of Supp. Authority, ECF No. 91. \n\n93a \n \nthe Court should dismiss the amended complaint be-\ncause Plaintiffs lack standing and, alternatively, be-\ncause Defendants prevail on the merits.  See Defs.\u2019 \nSumm. J. Br., ECF No. 64.  The parties exchanged \nbriefs, and the Court held a hearing on July 26, 2022.  \nThe motions are ripe for review. \nIn sum, the issues before the Court are (1) whether \nPlaintiffs have standing; (2) whether PSTF, ACIP, and \nHRSA violate the Appointments Clause; (3) whether \nPSTF members have removal protections that violate \nArticle II\u2019s Vesting Clause; (4) whether PSTF, ACIP, \nand HRSA violate the nondelegation doctrine; and (5) \nwhether the PrEP mandate violates RFRA. \nII. LEGAL STANDARD \nSummary judgment is appropriate only where the \npleadings and evidence show \u201cthere is no genuine dis-\npute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled \nto judgment as a matter of law.\u201d  Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a).  \nSummary judgment is not \u201ca disfavored procedural \nshortcut, but rather  . . .  an integral part of the Fed-\neral Rules as a whole, which are designed \u2018to secure the \njust, speedy and inexpensive determination of every ac-\ntion.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 327 \n(1986) (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 1).  A genuine dispute of \nmaterial fact exists \u201cif the evidence is such that a rea-\nsonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving \nparty.\u201d  Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, \n248 (1986).  \u201c[T]he substantive law will identify which \nfacts are material.\u201d  Id.  The movant must inform the \ncourt of the basis for its motion and identify the portions \nof the record that reveal there are no genuine disputes \nof material fact.  Celotex, 477 U.S. at 323. \n\n94a \n \nThe court must view the evidence in the light most \nfavorable to the nonmovant.  Ion v. Chevron USA, Inc., \n731 F.3d 379, 389 (5th Cir. 2013).  \u201cMoreover, a court \nmust draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the non-\nmoving party and may not make credibility determina-\ntions or weigh the evidence.\u201d  Id.  And if there ap-\npears to be some support for disputed allegations, such \nthat \u201creasonable minds could differ as to the import of \nthe evidence,\u201d the court must deny the motion for sum-\nmary judgment.  Anderson, 477 U.S. at 250. \nThe opposing party must \u201cidentify specific evidence \nin the record and  . . .  articulate the precise manner \nin which that evidence supports his or her claim.\u201d  Ra-\ngas v. Tenn. Gas Pipeline Co., 136 F.3d 455, 458 (5th Cir. \n1998).  If a party \u201cfails to make a showing sufficient to \nestablish the existence of an element essential to that \nparty\u2019s case, and on which that party will bear the bur-\nden of proof at trial,\u201d the court must grant summary \njudgment.  Celotex, 477 U.S. at 322.  In that situation, \nno genuine dispute of material fact can exist, as the fail-\nure to establish an essential element of the claim \u201cnec-\nessarily renders all other facts immaterial.\u201d  Id. at 323. \nIII. ANALYSIS \nA. \nStanding \nThe U.S. Constitution limits the jurisdiction of fed-\neral courts to \u201cCases\u201d and \u201cControversies.\u201d  U.S. \nConst., art. III, \u00a7 2.  The case-or-controversy limita-\ntion requires plaintiffs seeking relief in federal court to \nshow they have constitutional standing to pursue their \nclaims.  Lujan v. Defs. of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560-61 \n(1992).  \u201cConstitutional standing has three elements:  \n(1) an \u2018injury in fact\u2019 that is (a) concrete and particular-\n\n95a \n \nized and (b) actual or imminent; (2) a causal connection \nbetween the injury and the conduct complained of; and \n(3) the likelihood that a favorable decision will redress \nthe injury.\u201d  Croft v. Governor of Tex., 562 F.3d 735, \n745 (5th Cir. 2009) (quoting Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560).  At \nthe summary judgment stage, a plaintiff \u201cmust \u2018set \nforth\u2019 by affidavit or other evidence \u2018specific facts,\u2019\u200a\u201d es-\ntablishing the elements of standing.  Lujan, 504 U.S. \nat 561 (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e)). \nAs Plaintiffs point out, Braidwood presents the easi-\nest case for standing.  See Pls.\u2019 Resp. 10, ECF No. 74. \nBraidwood self-insures its seventy employees and must \ntherefore provide ACA-compliant health insurance.  \nSee 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 4980H(c)(2).  Through the preventive-\ncare mandates, ACA insurance policies must cover, \namong other things, PrEP drugs, the HPV vaccine, and \nscreenings and behavioral counseling for STDs and drug \nuse.  Hotze objects to those services on both religious \nand non-religious grounds, claiming they facilitate and \nencourage homosexual behavior, intravenous drug use, \nand sexual activity outside of marriage between one man \nand one woman.  See Pls.\u2019 App. 72, ECF No. 46.  Hotze \nsays that providing this coverage in Braidwood\u2019s self-in-\nsured plan violates his religious beliefs by making him \ncomplicit in encouraging those behaviors.  Id. \nBraidwood has demonstrated several Article III in-\njuries.  First, the mandates deprive Braidwood of the \nability to choose whether and to what extent its insur-\nance plan covers preventive care.  When a plaintiff is \nthe object of the challenged government action, \u201cthere \nis ordinarily little question\u201d that the action has caused \ninjury.  Lujan, 504 U.S. at 561-62.  The ACA requires \nBraidwood to cover the preventive services mandated \n\n96a \n \nunder \u00a7 300gg-13.  See 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 4980H(c)(2).  Braid-\nwood is also prohibited from imposing cost-sharing ar-\nrangements, such as deductibles or co-pays, for those \nservices.  See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(a).  Hotze wants \nBraidwood\u2019s plan to exclude or limit coverage for the \npreventive-care services mandated under \u00a7 300gg-13, \nbut Braidwood cannot exclude coverage for those ser-\nvices without violating the law.  See Pls.\u2019 App. 70-72, \nECF No. 46. \nSecond, the mandates force Braidwood to underwrite \ncoverage for services to which it holds sincere religious \nobjections.  This injury is distinct from the pocketbook \ninjury Braidwood would incur in paying for the objec-\ntionable services.  Because Braidwood self-insures, \nHotze believes that offering coverage is itself a tacit en-\ndorsement of the behaviors that he believes the services \nencourage.  See Pls.\u2019 App. 72, ECF No. 46.  Many courts \nhave already addressed this type of injury, recognizing \nthat the contraceptive mandate caused an injury in fact \nbecause it rendered plaintiffs \u201ccomplicit in a scheme \naimed at providing coverage to which they have a reli-\ngious objection.\u201d  Archdiocese of St. Louis v. Burwell, \n28 F. Supp. 3d 944, 951 (E.D. Mo. 2014) (citation and in-\nternal quotation marks omitted) (collecting cases).  In-\ndeed, \u201cit is beyond question\u201d that religious employers \nhave Article III standing to challenge a government \nmandate that infringes on their religious liberties \u201cby \nrequiring them to lend what their religion teaches to be \nan impermissible degree of assistance to the commission \nof what their religion teaches to be a moral wrong.\u201d  \nHobby Lobby Stores, Inc. v. Sebelius, 723 F.3d 1114, \n1154 (10th Cir. 2013) (Gorsuch, J., concurring), aff\u200a\u2019d sub \nnom. Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc., 573 U.S. 682 \n(2014).  Hotze\u2019s declaration establishes that the pre-\n\n97a \n \nventive-care mandates compel behavior that violates his \nreligious beliefs, which is sufficient evidence of an injury \nin fact.  See Lujan, 504 U.S. at 561. \nThird, Braidwood faces a penalty for failing to com-\nply with the mandates.  Because Braidwood has more \nthan fifty employees, it faces a tax of $100 per day for \neach employee not covered in accordance with the ACA.  \nSee 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 4980D, 4980H.  Requiring religious \nemployers to choose between complying with a service \ncoverage mandate and paying a penalty imposes a sub-\nstantial burden on religious freedom, and an injury in \nfact.  See Hobby Lobby Stores, 573 U.S. at 719-20.   \nDefendants\u2019 counterarguments are unpersuasive.  \nDefendants claim that Plaintiffs limited their religious \nobjections to the PrEP mandate.  They argue that the \nCourt should thus consider only alleged injuries pertain-\ning to the PrEP mandate.  See Defs.\u2019 Cross Summ. J. \nBr. 31-32, ECF No. 64.  Plaintiffs concede that their \nRFRA claims are limited to the PrEP mandate.3  But \n \n3  Plaintiffs\u2019 initial complaint asserted RFRA claims against com-\npulsory coverage of the various services Plaintiffs found objection-\nable, including PrEP drugs, contraception, the HPV vaccine, and \nscreenings and behavioral counseling for STDs and drug use.  See \nCompl. 27-31, ECF No. 1.  Plaintiffs\u2019 amended complaint drops all \nbut one of those RFRA claims, challenging only the PrEP mandate.  \nSee 1st Am. Compl., ECF No. 14.  Plaintiffs nevertheless moved for \nsummary judgment on their claims that compulsory coverage of \nPrEP drugs, the HPV vaccine, and the screenings and behavioral \ncounseling for STDs and drug use violates RFRA.  See Pls.\u2019 Summ. \nJ. Br. 35-42, ECF No. 45.  Defendants argue that Plaintiffs are \nbound by their amended complaint, and thus the Court may con-\nsider Plaintiffs\u2019 RFRA challenges only as to the PrEP mandate.  \nSee Defs.\u2019 Cross Summ. J. Br. 31-32, ECF No. 64.  The parties \ndisputed that point in the briefing, but at the hearing Plaintiffs con-\n \n\n98a \n \nPlaintiffs still suffer injury based on their religious ob-\njections to the other mandates.  Plaintiffs claim that \nthe various preventive-care mandates violate the Ap-\npointments Clause, the Vesting Clause, and the nondele-\ngation doctrine.  Braidwood\u2019s standing to assert those \nclaims is based on the injuries discussed: in sum, that  \n\u00a7 300gg-13 requires  Braidwood to cover services it \ndoes not wish to cover for both religious and non-reli-\ngious reasons.  That Braidwood limited its RFRA \nclaim to the PrEP mandate does not mean that it waived \nall claims of injury based on its religious objections.  \nEven as to its non-RFRA claims, Braidwood\u2019s religious \nobjections are \u201clegally protected interest[s].\u201d  Lujan, \n504 U.S. at 560. Braidwood has established by compe-\ntent evidence that \u00a7 300gg-13 invades those interests.  \nThose invasions are \u201cconcrete and particularized\u201d and \n\u201cactual or imminent,\u201d which means that Braidwood has \nsuffered an injury in fact.  Id. \nDefendants\u2019 remaining arguments against Braid-\nwood\u2019s standing proceed on the incorrect premise that \nBraidwood\u2019s injuries must pertain to covering PrEP \ndrugs.  Even adopting that incorrect premise, how-\never, Defendants\u2019 arguments are unpersuasive.  De-\nfendants point out that Braidwood has not provided ev-\nidence that it has paid for or will likely pay for PrEP \ndrugs.  In Defendants\u2019 view, that makes Braidwood\u2019s \ninjury hypothetical.  Until Braidwood is faced with \npaying for PrEP drugs, it \u201coperates only under a legal \nobligation to cover PrEP if such a claim is submitted, \nand an abstract legal obligation is insufficient to estab-\nlish standing.\u201d  See Defs.\u2019 Cross Summ. J. Br. 34, ECF \n \nceded that their RFRA challenges are limited to the PrEP man-\ndate.  See H. Trans.  24-25 (Rough Draft). \n\n99a \n \nNo. 64 (citing Barber v. Bryant, 860 F.3d 345, 357 (5th \nCir. 2017)). \nDefendants \nmisunderstand \nBraidwood\u2019s \ninjury.  \nBraidwood is not merely alleging a traditional \u201cpocket-\nbook injury.\u201d  California v. Texas, 141 S. Ct. 2104, 2114 \n(2021).  Distinct from his risk of pecuniary harm, Hotze \nasserts an ongoing dignitary harm, claiming that merely \n\u201cproviding this coverage in Braidwood\u2019s self-insured \nplan would make [him] complicit\u201d in behaviors that vio-\nlate his religious beliefs.  Pls.\u2019 App. 72, ECF No. 46.  \nTherefore, Braidwood faces not only a potential future \ninjury in the form of paying for preventive care, but also \na current injury in the form of underwriting services \nthat violate Hotze\u2019s religious beliefs.  Braidwood\u2019s nu-\nmerous injuries are of the kind that courts have consist-\nently found appropriate for Article III adjudication. \nThe next two standing requirements\u2014causation and \nredressability\u2014are \neven \nmore \nstraightforward.  \nBraidwood \u201cmust satisfy the \u2018causation\u2019 and \u2018redressa-\nbility\u2019 prongs of the Art. III minima by showing that the \ninjury \u2018fairly can be traced to the challenged action\u2019 and \n\u2018is likely to be redressed by a favorable decision.\u2019\u200a\u201d  \nWhitmore v. Arkansas, 495 U.S. 149, 155 (1990).  \nAgain, when a plaintiff suffers injury as the object of the \nchallenged government action, \u201cthere is ordinarily little \nquestion that the action  . . .  has caused him injury, \nand that a judgment preventing  . . .  the action will \nredress it.\u201d  Lujan, 504 U.S. at 561-62.  Section \n300gg-13 prohibits Braidwood from excluding coverage \nand imposing cost-sharing arrangements for various \nservices to which it objects.  And Braidwood faces a \nsignificant tax for not complying with the law.  See 26 \nU.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 4980D, 4980H.  Braidwood seeks declaratory \n\n100a \n \nand injunctive relief to prevent Defendants from enforc-\ning the preventive-care mandates against it.  There is \nno doubt that Braidwood\u2019s injuries are fairly traceable \nto Defendants\u2019 enforcement of the preventive-care man-\ndates and that granting Braidwood\u2019s requested relief \nwould likely redress its injuries.  Indeed, Defendants \nconceded at oral argument that assuming Braidwood \nhas suffered an injury (which Defendants contest), that \ninjury is traceable and redressable.  Braidwood has \nstanding to pursue its claims.   \nPlaintiffs argue that because Braidwood has stand-\ning, the Court need not inquire into the standing of the \nother Plaintiffs.  See Pls.\u2019 Resp. 10, ECF No. 74.  For \npurposes of resolving these summary judgment mo-\ntions, Plaintiffs are correct.  As previously discussed, \nBraidwood has standing for all its claims.  And because \nall Plaintiffs bring the same claims as Braidwood, the \nCourt may address the merits of each claim.  See Town \nof Chester v. Laroe Ests., Inc., 137 S. Ct. 1645, 1650-51 \n(2017) (\u201cAt least one plaintiff must have standing to seek \neach form of relief requested in the complaint.\u201d).  But \nwhen it comes to granting relief, each Plaintiff must \nshow it has standing to obtain the relief sought.  See id. \nat 1650; Arizona v. Biden, 31 F.4th 469, 483 (6th Cir. \n2022) (Sutton, C.J., concurring) (\u201cA valid Article III \nremedy operates with respect to specific parties, not \nwith respect to law in the abstract,\u201d which \u201cis why courts \ngenerally grant relief in a party-specific and injury-fo-\ncused manner.\u201d (cleaned up)).  For the remaining \nPlaintiffs to show standing, \u201cmuch more is needed,\u201d be-\ncause, unlike Braidwood, their asserted injuries \u201carise[] \nfrom the government\u2019s allegedly unlawful regulation (or \nlack of regulation) of someone else.\u201d  Lujan, 504 U.S. \nat 562.  The parties offered to file supplemental briefs \n\n101a \n \naddressing the scope of relief and standing for the re-\nmaining Plaintiffs.  For now, the Court proceeds to the \nmerits. \nB. \nAppointments Clause \nThe Appointments Clause lays out the permissible \nmethods of appointing \u201cOfficers of the United States.\u201d  \nU.S. Const. art. II, \u00a7 2, cl. 2.  Principal officers must be \nnominated by the President and confirmed by the Sen-\nate.  Id.  But Congress can authorize the appointment \nof \u201cinferior Officers\u201d by the President alone, the courts, \nor \u201cthe Heads of Departments.\u201d  Id. \nPlaintiffs argue that the members of PSTF, ACIP, \nand HRSA are principal officers who must be appointed \nby the President and confirmed by the Senate.  See \nPls.\u2019 Summ. J. Br. 24-25, ECF No. 45.  At the very \nleast, Plaintiffs say, those agencies are comprised of in-\nferior officers whose appointments may be vested in an \nagency head.  See id. at 25-27.  Regardless, Plaintiffs \nargue that the appointment process for members of all \nthree agencies does not satisfy either constitutional \nmethod for appointing officers of the United States.  \nSee id. at 24-27.  Defendants dispute all those claims.  \nAccording to Defendants, the appointment processes for \nmembers of PSTF, ACIP, and HRSA are constitution-\nally permissible.  See Defs.\u2019 Summ. J. Br., ECF No. 64.  \nIn any event, Defendants argue, the HHS Secretary\u2019s \nratification of the challenged provisions nullifies Plain-\ntiffs\u2019 Appointments Clause challenges.  Id. at 38-45.  \nThe Court begins by addressing ratification, which nar-\nrows the issues. \n \n \n\n102a \n \n \n1. The HHS Secretary ratified the directives of \nACIP and HRSA, but not of PSTF. \nSeveral circuits have held that a properly appointed \nofficial can ratify an improperly appointed official\u2019s ac-\ntion.  The D.C. Circuit has \u201crepeatedly held that a pro-\nperly appointed official\u2019s ratification of an allegedly im-\nproper official\u2019s prior action, rather than mooting a \nclaim, resolves the claim on the merits by \u2018remedying \nthe defect\u2019 (if any) from the initial appointment.\u201d  \nGuedes v. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms & Ex-\nplosives, 920 F.3d 1, 13 (D.C. Cir. 2019) (cleaned up). \nThe Second, Third, and Ninth Circuits agree.  See \nNLRB v. Newark Elec. Corp., 14 F.4th 152, 160-63 (2d \nCir. 2021); Kajmowicz v. Whitaker, 42 F.4th 138, 152 (3d \nCir. 2022); CFPB v. Gordon, 819 F.3d 1179, 1191 (9th \nCir. 2016). \nQuestions of ratification are \u201cat least presumptively \ngoverned by principles of agency law.\u201d  FEC v. NRA \nPol. Victory Fund, 513 U.S. 88, 98 (1994).  One basic \nprinciple is that \u201cfor a ratification to be effective, \u2018it is \nessential that the party ratifying should be able not \nmerely to do the act ratified at the time the act was done, \nbut also at the time the ratification was made.\u2019\u200a\u201d   Gor-\ndon, 819 F.3d at 1191 (quoting NRA Pol. Victory Fund, \n513 U.S. at 98).  At the very least, the party ratifying \nmust have \u201cthe capacity to act at the time of ratifica-\ntion.\u201d  Id. (citing Restatement on Agency (Third) \u00a7 4.04 \ncmt. b).  Those principles resolve the ratification issues \npresented here. \nFirst, the Secretary ratified the ACIP recommenda-\ntions that Plaintiffs challenge.  ACIP, as part of the \nPublic Health Service, is \u201cunder the supervision and di-\nrection of the Secretary.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 202.  ACIP re-\n\n103a \n \nports to the CDC Director, who exercises delegated au-\nthority from the Secretary.  See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 243, 247b.  \n\u201c\u200a\u2018The power to superintend,\u2019 [Alexander Hamilton] ex-\nplained, \u2018must imply a right to judge and direct,\u2019 thereby \nensuring that \u2018the responsibility for a wrong construc-\ntion rests with the head of the department, when it pro-\nceeds from him.\u2019\u200a\u201d  United States v. Arthrex, Inc., 141 \nS. Ct. 1970, 1983 (2021) (quoting 3 The Works of Alexan-\nder Hamilton 559 (J. Hamilton ed. 1850)).  In recogni-\ntion of that principle, Defendants claim that \u201cthe Secre-\ntary is empowered to direct ACIP\u2019s recommendation of \nspecific vaccines.\u201d  Defs.\u2019 Supp. Filing 2, ECF No. 86.  \nAnd because a vaccine recommendation from ACIP \u201cis \nconsidered in effect after it has been adopted by the Di-\nrector of the [CDC],\u201d the Secretary has authority over \nwhat vaccines are covered under \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(2).  45 \nC.F.R. \u00a7 147.130(a)(1)(ii).  The Secretary ratified \nACIP\u2019s recommendations that Plaintiffs challenge.4  See \nDefs.\u2019 App. 6, ECF No. 65.  Because he has authority \nto require, reject, or alter ACIP\u2019s recommendations, the \nSecretary\u2019s ratification of the challenged ACIP provi-\nsions remedies any appointment defects of ACIP re-\ngarding those recommendations.  See Guedes, 920 F.3d \nat 13. \nLikewise, the Secretary ratified the HRSA guide-\nlines that Plaintiffs challenge.  Like ACIP, HRSA is \npart of the Public Health Service and thus \u201cunder the \nsupervision and direction of the Secretary.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 202.  HRSA is directed by an Administrator who, like \nthe CDC Director, is answerable to the Secretary.  See \n47 Fed. Reg. at 38,410.  The Secretary is thus \u201cempow-\n \n4  The parties do not dispute that Secretary Xavier Becerra is a \nconstitutionally appointed principal officer. \n\n104a \n \nered to direct HRSA to include particular care and \nscreenings in the guidelines they support under 42 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(3) and (a)(4),\u201d as Defendants ad-\nmit.  Defs.\u2019 Supp. Filing 1, ECF No. 86.  The Secre-\ntary ratified the HRSA guidelines that Plaintiffs chal-\nlenge, 5  which remedies any appointment defects of \nHRSA regarding those guidelines.  See Guedes, 920 \nF.3d at 13. \nPlaintiffs raise several counterarguments.  First, \nPlaintiffs argue that the Secretary has no authority to \nratify the agencies\u2019 actions because \u00a7 300gg-13(a) \u201ccom-\npels\u201d the Secretary to implement the agencies\u2019 deci-\nsions.  Pls.\u2019 Resp. Br. 19-21, ECF No. 74.  Plaintiffs \nare correct that the Secretary \u201cshall\u201d enforce insurance \ncoverage for the services identified by the three agen-\ncies.  See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13.  But \u00a7 300gg-13(a) \ncontains no language removing or modifying the Secre-\ntary\u2019s background authority over ACIP and HRSA as to \nthe services themselves.  Indeed, Congress recognized \nthat it was legislating against that background structure \nby referring to \u201crecommendations\u201d and \u201cguidelines.\u201d  \nACIP has authority (given to it by the Secretary) to pro-\nvide vaccine recommendations, which are subject to the \nabsolute control of the Secretary.  So, too, with HRSA.  \nIf Congress intends to alter the fundamental details of a \nregulatory scheme, courts \u201cexpect it to speak with the \nrequisite clarity to place that intent beyond dispute.\u201d  \nU.S. Forest Serv. v. Cowpasture River Pres. Ass\u2019n, 140 \nS. Ct. 1837, 1849 (2020) (quoting Epic Sys. Corp. v. \nLewis, 138 S. Ct. 1612, 1626-27 (2018)).  Section 300gg-\n \n5  Defs.\u2019 App. 6, ECF No. 65. \n\n105a \n \n13(a) is devoid of any clear statement stripping the Sec-\nretary of his authority over ACIP and HRSA. \nSecond, Plaintiffs argue that even if the Secretary \nhas ratified the challenged actions, \u00a7 300gg-13(a) would \nstill violate the Appointments Clause because ACIP\u2019s \nand HRSA\u2019s actions are effective even before a consti-\ntutionally appointed officer ratifies them.  Pls.\u2019 Summ. \nJ. Br. 29, ECF No. 45.  In other words, Plaintiffs say \nthat ratification cannot cure the appointment problems \nbecause ACIP and HRSA are still exercising \u201csignifi-\ncant authority pursuant to the laws of the United States\u201d \nuntil their decisions are ratified.  Lucia v. SEC, 138  \nS. Ct. 2044, 2049 (2018) (holding that the SEC\u2019s admin-\nistrative law judges are \u201cofficers of the United States,\u201d \neven though their decisions are subject to review by the \nSEC itself\u200a).  But Article III standing principles do not \npermit Plaintiffs to challenge an unlawful appointment \ngenerally, or to challenge future exercises of unlawful \nauthority.  Plaintiffs\u2019 injuries must be traceable to gov-\nernment action.  And the Secretary has ratified the \nparticular actions of ACIP and HRSA that Plaintiffs \ncomplain of.  \nPlaintiffs\u2019 argument attacks the very principle of rat-\nification.  If Plaintiffs are correct, post hoc approval by \nan appropriate government actor cannot retroactively \ncure an earlier exercise of authority that was constitu-\ntionally defective.  But the circuits have so far unani-\nmously agreed that ratification may cure Appointment \nClause problems, and Plaintiffs do not present a compel-\nling reason to deviate from the consensus.  The Secre-\ntary effectively ratified the ACIP and HRSA actions \nthat Plaintiffs challenge, so the Court need not address \nthe Appointments Clause issues regarding those two \n\n106a \n \nagencies.  The Court thus GRANTS partial summary \njudgment in favor of Defendants on Claim 1 of the \nAmended Complaint as to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(2), \n(a)(3), and (a)(4). \nPSTF is different.  According to Defendants, the \nSecretary may not direct PSTF to \u201cgive a specific pre-\nventive service an \u2018A\u2019 or \u2018B\u2019 rating, such that it would be \ncovered pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(1).\u201d  Defs.\u2019 \nSuppl. Filing 3, ECF No. 86.  That is because all PSTF \nmembers \u201cand any recommendations made by such \nmembers, shall be independent and, to the extent prac-\nticable, not subject to political pressure.\u201d  42 U.S.C.  \n\u00a7 299b-4(a)(6).  The Secretary, a political actor, thus \ndoes not have authority to direct what services are cov-\nered under \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(1).  Arguably, the phrase \u201cto \nthe extent practicable\u201d permits some level of direction \nby the Secretary.  Id.  But whatever that phrase \nmeans, it does not provide an exception for the Secre-\ntary to decree recommendations unilaterally. That ex-\nception would swallow the rule that \u201crecommendations\u201d \nmust be \u201cindependent\u201d and \u201cnot subject to political \npressure.\u201d  Id.  Because the Secretary lacks authority \nto determine or direct what services receive an \u201cA\u201d or \n\u201cB\u201d rating, he cannot ratify PSTF\u2019s decisions on that \nsubject.  See Gordon, 819 F.3d at 1191.  Defendants \nimplicitly recognize as much by arguing that only the \nACIP and HRSA ratifications were effective\u2014not \nPSTF.  See Defs.\u2019 Summ. J. Br. 39-43, ECF No. 64. The \nCourt must therefore address the Appointments Clause \nchallenge to PSTF. \n \n \n\n107a \n \n \n2. The members of PSTF are officers of the \nUnited States. \nA person is an officer of the United States if he (1) \noccupies a \u201c\u200a\u2018continuing\u2019 position established by law\u201d and \n(2) exercises \u201csignificant authority pursuant to the laws \nof the United States.\u201d  Lucia, 138 S. Ct. at 2051 (inter-\nnal quotation marks and citations omitted).  The mem-\nbers of PSTF satisfy both criteria. \nFirst, PSTF members occupy a continuing position \nestablished by law.  Congress requires the Director of \nAHRQ to \u201cconvene\u201d PSTF by assembling a group of  \n\u201cindividuals with appropriate expertise.\u201d  42 U.S.C.  \n\u00a7 299b-4(a)(1).  Congress described the purpose of \nPSTF, assigned its duties, authorized appropriations for \nits activities, and insulated it from political pressure.  \nSee id. \u00a7 299b-4.  Regulations lay out extensive qualifi-\ncations for the members, who serve four-year terms.  \nSee Solicitation for Nominations for Members of the \nU.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF), 87 \nFed. Reg. 2436, 2436-37 (Jan. 14, 2022).  These posi-\ntions will continue until Congress amends or repeals the \nstatute creating them.  They are \u201cpublic station[s], or \nemployment, conferred by the appointment of govern-\nment.\u201d  United States v. Hartwell, 73 U.S. 385, 393 \n(1867). \nThe PSTF positions are \u201ccontinuing and permanent\u201d \nrather than \u201coccasional or temporary.\u201d  Lucia, 138  \nS. Ct. at 2051.  Among other things, PSTF must submit \nyearly reports to Congress and other agencies identify-\ning gaps in research and recommending areas for fur-\nther examination.  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(2)(F).  At \nleast once every five years, PSTF must review interven-\ntions and update recommendations.  Id.  These con-\n\n108a \n \ngressionally created duties are regular, not occasional.  \nCf. United States v. Germaine, 99 U.S. 508, 511-12 (1878) \n(holding that a civil surgeon tasked with assisting the \nCommissioner of Pensions was not an officer in part be-\ncause he was \u201conly to act when called on by the Commis-\nsioner of Pensions in some special case\u201d); Auffmordt v. \nHedden, 137 U.S. 310, 326-27 (1890) (holding that a mer-\nchant appraiser valuing goods for the customs service \nwas not an officer of the United States because he had \n\u201cno general functions, nor any employment which ha[d] \nany duration as to time, or which extend[ed] over any \ncase further than as he [was] selected to act in that par-\nticular case\u201d). \nDefendants argue that PSTF members are not offic-\ners because their work is \u201cpart-time.\u201d  Defs.\u2019 Summ. J. \nBr. 64, ECF No. 64.  But the difference between a tem-\nporary position and a permanent position has more to do \nwith \u201cideas of tenure and duration\u201d than with the rela-\ntive workload of the job.  Lucia, 138 S. Ct. at 2051 \n(cleaned up).  PSTF members serve four-year terms in \na statutorily created position to carry out regular duties \nassigned by Congress.  That role is nothing short of \u201ca \ncontinuing and formalized relationship of employment \nwith the United States Government.\u201d  Riley v. St. Luke\u2019s \nEpiscopal Hosp., 252 F.3d 749, 757 (5th Cir. 2001) (en \nbanc).  Regardless, to the extent courts consider the \nrelative workload a position requires, the duties of \nPSTF members cannot be brushed aside as minimal.  \nPSTF applicants must have \u201cadequate time to contrib-\nute substantively to the work products of [PSTF].\u201d  87 \nFed. Reg. at 2437.  The members meet three times a \nyear for two days in Washington, D.C. (paid for by the \ntaxpayer).  Id.  But a \u201csignificant portion\u201d of their \nwork occurs between meetings.  Id.  Members must \n\n109a \n \nexpect frequent emails, \u201cmultiple conference calls each \nmonth,\u201d and interaction with stakeholders.  Id.  In-\ndeed, \u201cmembers devote approximately 200 hours a year \noutside of in-person meetings\u201d to carrying out their du-\nties.  Id.  The part-time nature of the PSTF positions, \neven if relevant, does not indicate that the positions are \noccasional or temporary. \nDefendants also argue that PSTF members are not \nofficers because they do not receive compensation for \ntheir service.  See Defs.\u2019 Summ. J. Br. 53, ECF No. 64.  \nIn Riley, the Fifth Circuit observed that \u201cSupreme \nCourt precedent has established that the constitutional \ndefinition of an \u2018officer\u2019 encompasses, at a minimum, a \ncontinuing and formalized relationship of employment \nwith the United States Government.\u201d  Riley, 252 F.3d \nat 757 (first citing Auffmordt, 137 U.S. at 327; and then \nciting Germaine, 99 U.S. at 511-12).  Defendants argue \nthat by \u201cemployment,\u201d the \nFifth Circuit means paid employment.  But neither \nthe word \u201cemployment\u201d nor the surrounding context in \nRiley implies that compensation is a necessary element \nof an office.  The merchant in Auffmordt was not an of-\nficer in part because he was paid on a case-by-case basis \nand received no \u201ccontinuing emolument.\u201d  Auffmordt, \n137 U.S. at 327.  The surgeon in Germaine was not an \nofficer in part because his payment was by commission \nprescribed by regulation, not \u201cregular appropriation.\u201d  \nGermaine, 99 U.S. at 511.  And the qui tam plaintiffs in \nRiley were not officers because, \u201c[f]or instance,\u201d they \ndid \u201cnot draw a government salary.\u201d  Riley, 252 F.3d \nat 757. \nThe cases demonstrate that monetary compensation \nis one aspect among many relevant to determining \n\n110a \n \nwhether a position is \u201ccontinuing and formalized.\u201d  Id.  \nBut employment positions take many forms, offering \ndifferent terms, hours, compensation, and responsibili-\nties.  See Germaine, 99 U.S. at 511 (\u201c[T]he term em-\nbraces the ideas of tenure, duration, emolument, and du-\nties.\u201d).  To be sure, the absence of a regular salary \nmakes the PSTF positions appear less \u201ccontinuing and \nformalized\u201d than a salaried position, other things being \nequal.  Riley, 252 F.3d at 757.  But it is not disposi-\ntive, particularly when the members receive at least \nsome compensation for travel to meetings and trainings.  \nSee 87 Fed. Reg. at 2437. \nThe Supreme Court and Fifth Circuit have not set a \nminimum-hours requirement for officers of the United \nStates.  Nor have they forbidden an officer from hold-\ning other employment.  Nor have they required a par-\nticular form of compensation.  Rather, courts consider \nvarious characteristics to determine whether the nature \nof the position is continuing and formalized.  See Lu-\ncia, 138 S. Ct. at 2051; Riley, 252 F.3d at 757.  Con-\ngress created PSTF, assigned it various duties, and re-\nquires its regular employment.  The positions are fixed \nby statute and will continue indefinitely.  Members \nmust be specially qualified, and they are selected in a \ncompetitive process.  They serve four-year terms that \nrequire meetings, research, drafting, and many other \nresponsibilities.  They receive compensation in sup-\nport of their travel for in-person meetings, which they \nhold three times a year.  These qualities indicate that \nPSTF members occupy a \u201c\u200a\u2018continuing\u2019 position estab-\nlished by law.\u201d  Lucia, 138 S. Ct. at 2051. \nSecond, PSTF members exercise significant author-\nity pursuant to the laws of the United States.  This sec-\n\n111a \n \nond step \u201cfocuse[s] on the extent of power an individual \nwields in carrying out his assigned functions.\u201d  Lucia, \n138 S. Ct. at 2051.  PSTF has authority to determine \nwhat preventive-care services receive an \u201cA\u201d or \u201cB\u201d rat-\ning.  Private insurers must cover all services with an \n\u201cA\u201d or \u201cB\u201d rating. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(1).  There-\nfore, PSTF has authority to determine what preventive-\ncare services private insurers must cover.  That in-\ncludes the authority to determine the scope of any reli-\ngious or nonreligious exemptions.  See Little Sisters of \nthe Poor Saints Peter & Paul Home v. Pennsylvania, \n140 S. Ct. 2367, 2380 (2020) (holding that \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(4) \ngives HRSA the authority to determine \u201cthe ability to \nidentify and create exemptions from its own Guide-\nlines\u201d). \nPSTF\u2019s authority over insurance policies is signifi-\ncant.  Just as special trial judges of the U.S. Tax Court \ncan issue the final decision in \u201ccomparatively narrow \nand minor matters\u201d before them, PSTF exercises final \nauthority over its narrow domain.  Lucia, 138 S. Ct. at \n2052 (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting Frey-\ntag v. Commissioner, 501 U.S. 868, 873 (1991)).  Whether \ninsurance providers must cover PrEP drugs and count-\nless other preventive services depends entirely on \nwhether PSTF recommends them.  PSTF wields a \npower to compel private action that resembles legisla-\ntive authority.  At the very least, it is on par with \nagency actions subject to approval by an agency head, \nwhich typically proceed through notice and comment \nprocedures.  But PSTF, unencumbered by the Admin-\nistrative Procedure Act, \u201cexercise[s] significant discre-\ntion\u201d in determining what services insurance providers \nmust cover.  Freytag, 501 U.S. at 882.  That degree of \nauthority is \u201cso \u2018significant\u2019 that it [is] inconsistent with \n\n112a \n \nthe classifications of \u2018lesser functionaries\u2019 or employ-\nees.\u201d  Id. at 881 (quoting Go-Bart Importing Co. v. \nUnited States, 282 U.S. 344, 352 (1931)).  PSTF thus \nexercises \u201csignificant authority pursuant to the laws of \nthe United States.\u201d  Lucia, 138 S. Ct. at 2051. \nDefendants try to avoid that conclusion by insisting \nthat PSTF makes \u201crecommendations,\u201d not law.  \u201cPSTF\u2019s \nrecommendations,\u201d Defendants argue, \u201care not exer-\ncises of the Executive or Legislative Power.  They are \n\u2018evidence-based\u2019 scientific recommendations about the \ncontemporary standard of care in preventive medicine.\u201d  \nDefs.\u2019 Summ. J. Br. 56, ECF No. 64.  But Defendants \nrely on a false dichotomy.  That PSTF makes \u201cscien-\ntific recommendations\u201d says nothing about whether it \nexercises legislative power.  Before Congress enacted \nthe ACA, PSTF\u2019s recommendations were merely recom-\nmendations.  Now, those recommendations have the \nforce and effect of law.  What PSTF \u201crecommends\u201d will \nbind insurance providers as forcefully as any law or reg-\nulation.  And as the Supreme Court said of HRSA, \nPSTF \u201chas virtually unbridled discretion to decide what \ncounts as preventive care.\u201d  Little Sisters of the Poor, \n140 S. Ct. at 2380. \nDefendants also point out that PSTF is tasked with \ndetermining the rating of individual preventive services, \nnot decreeing what ratings are covered by insurance.  \nCongress made the decision to give PSTF\u2019s recommen-\ndations the effect of required coverage.  In other \nwords, what matters are PSTF\u2019s \u201cpurposes,\u201d not the \u201cin-\ncidental\u201d effects of PSTF carrying out those purposes.  \nDefs.\u2019 Summ. J. Br. 56, ECF No. 64.  Lucia says oth-\nerwise.  What matters is \u201cthe extent of power an indi-\nvidual wields in carrying out his assigned functions.\u201d  \n\n113a \n \nLucia, 138 S. Ct. at 2051 (emphases added).  Whatever \nPSTF\u2019s assigned functions are (or whatever PSTF \nthinks its assigned functions are) is secondary to the \npower it wields in carrying out those functions.6  And \nthat power is nothing short of dictating what preventive \nservices insurance providers must cover. It is more \ntroubling, not less, that Defendants insist the agency \nwielding that power is apparently not even cognizant of \ndoing so.7  An officer is no less an officer because he is \noblivious to the power he wields. \nDefendants also argue \u00a7 300gg-13(a) is no different \nthan the numerous other times Congress has incorpo-\nrated materials by reference into law.  But the organi-\nzations involved in all Defendants\u2019 examples are private, \nstate, or foreign entities.8  None of the organizations \n \n6  It is also \u201cbeside the point\u201d that PSTF\u2019s decisions serve other \nnon-significant functions.  Freytag v. Commissioner, 501 U.S. 868, \n882 (1991).  \u201cThe fact that an inferior officer on occasion performs \nduties that may be performed by an employee not subject to the \nAppointments Clause does not transform his status under the Con-\nstitution.\u201d  Id. \n7  See Defs.\u2019 Reply Br. 34, ECF No. 83 (\u201cTrue, the PSTF\u2019s recom-\nmendations may be used for important purposes, including, as Con-\ngress has decided, being incorporated within certain insurance cov-\nerage.  But PSTF members themselves are not tasked with con-\nsidering what is appropriate about insurance at all, nor are they \ntasked with making discretionary decisions about insurance.  . . .  \n\u201d). \n8  See 4 U.S.C. \u00a7 119(a)(2) (requiring electronic databases estab-\nlished by states to \u201cbe provided in a format approved by the Amer-\nican National Standards Institute\u2019s Accredited Standards Commit-\ntee X12\u201d); 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 3372(a)(2)(A) (rendering unlawful the impor-\ntation \u201cany fish or wildlife taken, possessed, transported, or sold in \nviolation of any law or regulation of any State or in violation of  \nany foreign law\u201d); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 13(a) (criminalizing certain acts that \n \n\n114a \n \noccupy a \u201c\u200a\u2018continuing\u2019 position established by law\u201d in the \nfederal government.  Lucia, 138 S. Ct. at 2051.  De-\nfendants\u2019 examples do not present Appointments Clause \nproblems, then, because none pass even the first part of \nthe Lucia test.  PSTF members, in contrast, serve in \nan agency created by federal law.  And, perhaps more \nimportantly, \u00a7 300gg-13(a) differs from Defendants\u2019 ex-\namples in its \u201ccapacious grant of authority\u201d to the agen-\ncies \u201cto make these determinations,\u201d while leaving their \n\u201cdiscretion equally unchecked in other areas.\u201d  Little \nSisters of the Poor, 140 S. Ct. at 2380.  In short, De-\nfendants\u2019 argument \u201cignores the significance of the du-\nties and discretion\u201d of PSTF.  Freytag, 501 U.S. at 881. \nPSTF members occupy a continuing position estab-\nlished by law and exercise significant authority pursu-\nant to the laws of the United States.  See Lucia, 138  \nS. Ct. at 2051.  They are therefore officers of the \nUnited States. \n \n3. The members of PSTF are unconstitutionally \nappointed. \nBecause PSTF members are officers of the United \nStates, their appointments must comply with Article II.  \nPrincipal officers must be nominated by the President \nand confirmed by the Senate, while inferior officers may \nbe appointed by the President alone, the courts, or the \n \n\u201calthough not made punishable by any enactment of Congress, \nwould be punishable if committed  . . .  within the jurisdiction of \nthe State  . . .  by the laws thereof in force at the time of such \nact\u201d); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 6293(b)(8) (requiring test procedures for water \nclosets and urinals to comply with standards set by the American \nSociety of Mechanical Engineers). \n\n115a \n \nheads of departments, if Congress permits.

In other words, the difference \nbetween principal and inferior officers is one of relation-\nship, not of authority.  See id. (\u201cThe exercise of \u2018signif-\nicant authority pursuant to the laws of the United \nStates\u2019 marks, not the line between principal and infe-\nrior officer for Appointments Clause purposes, but ra-\nther  . . .  the line between officer and nonofficer.\u201d).  \nInferior officers, then, are \u201cofficers whose work is di-\nrected and supervised at some level by others who were \nappointed by Presidential nomination with the advice \nand consent of the Senate.\u201d  Id. at 663. \nPSTF members are principal officers.  The AHRQ Di-\nrector \u201cconvene[s]\u201d PSTF, but he is not necessarily part \nof PSTF, whose members are otherwise \u201cindependent.\u201d  \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(1), (a)(6).  In that regard, PSTF \nis different from ACIP and HRSA, which are subject to \nthe Secretary\u2019s control.  See supra Section III.B.1. \nPSTF is not even part of HHS, or any other agency.  \nSee Defs.\u2019 Summ. J. Br. 51, ECF No. 64.  AHRQ has no \noversight or supervision role over PSTF, and AHRQ\u2019s \nfunction is merely to \u201cprovide ongoing administrative, \nresearch, and technical support.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-\n4(a)(3).  The AHRQ Director is appointed by the Sec-\nretary, but he neither directs nor supervises PSTF or \nits members.  See id. \u00a7 299(a).  PSTF members are \nthus not inferior officers because they are not \u201cdirected \nand supervised at some level by others who were ap-\npointed by Presidential nomination with the advice and \nconsent of the Senate.\u201d  Edmond, 520 U.S. at 663.  \n\n116a \n \nPSTF members have no superior, so they are principal \nofficers under Article II.  Id. at 662. \nBecause PSTF members are principal officers, they \nmust be appointed by the President and confirmed by \nthe Senate.  See U.S. Const. art. II, \u00a7 2, cl. 2.  The PSTF \nmembers indisputably fail that constitutional require-\nment.  The members are \u201cconvene[d]\u201d by the AHRQ Di-\nrector.  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(1).  Defendants point to \nno other statute or regulation governing their selection.  \nPresumably, the AHRQ Director selects new members \nor delegates the task to other AHRQ employees.  See \n87 Fed. Reg. at 2437 (\u201cNominated individuals will be se-\nlected for [PSTF] on the basis of how well they meet the \nrequired qualifications and the current expertise needs \nof [PSTF].\u201d).  Regardless, PSTF members are not presi-\ndentially appointed. \nEven if PSTF members were inferior officers, their \nselection would still violate the Appointments Clause.  \nCongress can vest the appointment of inferior officers \nby the President alone, the courts, or the heads of de-\npartments.  U.S. Const. art. II, \u00a7 2, cl. 2.  If the power \nto \u201cconvene\u201d PSTF is commensurate with the power to \nappoint its members, then Congress arguably vested the \nappointment of PSTF members in the AHRQ Director.  \nSee 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(1).  The AHRQ Director is \nnot the President or an officer of the courts, so the only \nquestion is whether he is one of the \u201cHeads of Depart-\nments\u201d mentioned in Article II.  He is not.  \u201c[T]he \nterm \u2018Department\u2019 refers only to a part or division of the \nexecutive government, as the Department of State, or of \nthe Treasury, expressly created and given the name of \na department by Congress.\u201d  Freytag, 501 U.S. at 886 \n(cleaned up).  Defendants do not dispute that the AHRQ \n\n117a \n \nDirector is not a head of a department as understood in \nArticle II. \nRegardless of whether PSTF members are principal \nor inferior officers, they are unconstitutionally appointed.  \nDefendants dispute that PSTF members are officers of \nthe United States, but they do not resist the conclusion \nthat the selection of PSTF members does not comply \nwith the Appointments Clause procedures. \n* * * \nIn dressing up legal directives as expert recommen-\ndations, Defendants overlook the constitutional im-\nportance of the power those recommendations wield.  \nCongress may create agencies to recommend healthcare \nservices to public and private entities.  Doing so rarely \nposes constitutional problems because the recommenda-\ntions do not bind American citizens.  Under Defend-\nants\u2019 theory, Congress may then backfill those recom-\nmendations with the force and effect of law, complete \nwith hefty penalties for noncompliance.  Not only that, \nbut Congress can also mandate that all future recom-\nmendations have the force and effect of law, and it can \nmake those recommendations unreviewable by anyone \nelse.  Perhaps Congress may do those things consis-\ntent with the Constitution.  But when it does, Congress \nconfers power on those who, before, were making mere \nrecommendations.  The Constitution says that individ-\nuals exercising that kind of power must be appointed by \npolitically accountable officers.  \u201c[T]he Appointments \nClause of Article II is more than a matter of \u2018etiquette \nor protocol\u2019; it is among the significant structural safe-\nguards of the constitutional scheme.\u201d  Edmond, 520 \nU.S. at 659.  PSTF\u2019s appointment process deviates from \nArticle II\u2019s requirements, so the Court GRANTS partial \n\n118a \n \nsummary judgment in favor of Plaintiffs on Claim 1 of \nthe Amended Complaint as to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(1). \nThe Court will take further briefing on the appropri-\nate remedy, but one point is worth resolving here.  De-\nfendants say the proper remedy, if PSTF members are \nunconstitutionally appointed, is to allow the Secretary \nto ratify the actions of PSTF.  See Defs.\u2019 Summ. J. Br. \n57-58, ECF No. 64.  But Defendants have disclaimed \nthat the Secretary has any authority over PSTF.  And \nwithout authority, there can be no ratification.  See \nGordon, 819 F.3d at 1191.  Defendants\u2019 argument would \nmake sense, for example, in the context of an ACIP rec-\nommendation that the Secretary could ratify but had \nnot yet ratified.  But as for PSTF, the Secretary\u2019s rat-\nification is meaningless.  See supra Section III.B.1.  A \nsecond ratification would be equally meaningless. \nC. \nRemoval \nArticle II vests the \u201cexecutive Power\u201d in the Presi-\ndent, who must \u201ctake Care that the Laws be faithfully \nexecuted.\u201d  U.S. Const. art. II, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 3.  \u201cThe entire \u2018ex-\necutive Power\u2019 belongs to the President alone.\u201d  Seila L. \nLLC v. CFPB, 140 S. Ct. 2183, 2197 (2020).  Because it \nwould be impossible for the President to carry out the \nvast responsibility of the office by himself, Article II im-\nplies that the President may appoint lesser executive of-\nficers to assist him in his duties.  Id.  \u201cThat power, in \nturn, generally includes the ability to remove executive \nofficials, for it is \u2018only the authority that can remove\u2019 \nsuch officials that they \u2018must fear and, in the perfor-\nmance of [their] functions, obey.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Id. (alteration in \noriginal) (quoting Bowsher v. Synar, 478 U.S. 714, 726 \n(1986)). \n\n119a \n \nCongress may restrict the President\u2019s removal power \nover certain executive officers, to an extent.  Inferior \nofficers, for example, \u201cmay retain some amount of for-\ncause protection from firing.\u201d  Jarkesy v. SEC, 34 \nF.4th 446, 463 (5th Cir. 2022) (citing Morrison v. Olson, \n487 U.S. 654, 691-92 (1988)).  \u201cLikewise, even principal \nofficers may retain for-cause protection when they act \nas part of an expert board.\u201d  Id. (citing Seila L., 140  \nS. Ct. at 2192). \nPlaintiffs\u2019 removal claim fails because they do not \nidentify any removal restrictions on PSTF members.  \nPlaintiffs point to the provision requiring that all PSTF \nmembers \u201cand any recommendations made by such \nmembers, shall be independent and, to the extent prac-\nticable, not subject to political pressure.\u201d  42 U.S.C.  \n\u00a7 299b-4(a)(6).  But that language does not provide \nPSTF members tenure or insulate them from removal. \nPlaintiffs provide no persuasive argument as to why the \nprovision should be construed in the direction of a con-\nstitutional violation.  See Clark v. Martinez, 543 U.S. \n371, 381 (2005) (discussing the canon of constitutional \navoidance).  Quite simply, no statute forbids the Presi-\ndent, Secretary, or AHRQ Director from firing any \nmember of PSTF.  And without any removal re-\nstrictions, there is no removal problem under Article II. \nThat conclusion might appear to be in tension with \nthe Court\u2019s earlier conclusion that the Secretary lacks \nauthority to ratify PSTF decisions.  Recall that the \nSecretary does not have authority to direct what ser-\nvices are covered under \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(1), in part because \nof the political-insulation language in \u00a7 299b-4(a)(6).  \nSee supra III.B.1.  The phrase \u201cto the extent practica-\nble\u201d arguably permits the Secretary some amount of \n\n120a \n \ncontrol, but the Court did not construe the phrase to \npermit the Secretary to direct what services are cov-\nered.  The political-insulation language thus prohibits \nthe Secretary from directing what services are covered \nunder \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(1), but it does not prohibit the Sec-\nretary or the President from removing PSTF members.  \nThose interpretations are consistent for at least two rea-\nsons. \nFirst, the statute grants PSTF unilateral authority, \nbut not indefinite tenure.  Congress granted PSTF \ncomplete discretion to make its decisions.  AHRQ\u2019s \nrole is merely to provide administrative, research, and \ntechnical support for PSTF.  Even without the political- \ninsulation language, it is not clear that the Secretary \nwould have the authority to direct what services are cov-\nered under \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(1).  In contrast, Article II \nvests the President with the background authority to re-\nmove executive officials.  Unless Congress strips that \nauthority for a particular officer (and does so in a con-\nstitutionally permissible manner), the President retains \nremoval authority over that officer.  The Court\u2019s inter-\npretation of \u00a7 299b-4(a)(6) is thus consistent with the \nstatutory context (which gives PSTF authority over cov-\nered services) and consistent with the constitutional \nbackground (which gives the President authority to re-\nmove executive officers). \nSecond, no party advanced a construction of the  \npolitical-insulation language that would permit the Sec-\nretary to decree covered services under \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(1).  \nDefendants concede that the \u201cSecretary may not, con-\nsistent with \u00a7 299b-4(a)(6), direct that the PSTF give a \nspecific preventive service an \u2018A\u2019 or \u2018B\u2019 rating, such that \nit would be covered pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-\n\n121a \n \n13(a)(1).\u201d  Defs.\u2019 Suppl. Filing 3, ECF No. 86.  The \ncanon of constitutional avoidance \u201cis a tool for choosing \nbetween competing plausible interpretations of a statu-\ntory text, resting on the reasonable presumption that \nCongress did not intend the alternative which raises se-\nrious constitutional doubts.\u201d  Clark, 543 U.S. at 381.  \nAll parties\u2019 interpretations of the Secretary\u2019s authority \nover PSTF invite Appointments Clause problems.  In \ncontrast, the parties do offer competing interpretations \nof the political-insulation language as it relates to the \nremoval issue. \nThe removal analysis is unnecessarily complicated by \nthe fact that the members of the PSTF are unconstitu-\ntionally appointed.  As a general rule, officers are sub-\nject to removal by the same actor who appointed them, \nsubject to any other restrictions imposed by Congress.  \nSee, e.g., Seila L., 140 S. Ct. at 2197.  If the PSTF mem-\nbers had been properly appointed by the President as \nprincipal officers, or properly appointed by the Secre-\ntary of Health and Human Services as inferior officers, \nthen the Court\u2019s conclusion that they could be removed \nby those same appointing actors would be more readily \napparent, even when factoring in the political-insulation \nlanguage of \u00a7 299b-4(a)(6).  It is unsurprising that Con-\ngress\u2019s novel regulatory scheme produces novel legal \nproblems. \nIn sum, PSTF members do not have statutory tenure.  \nThey are removable at will.  The Court thus GRANTS \nsummary judgment in favor of Defendants as to Claim 3 \nof Plaintiffs\u2019 Amended Complaint. \n \n \n\n122a \n \nD. \nNondelegation \nThe Constitution vests \u201c[a]ll legislative Powers herein \ngranted  . . .  in a Congress of the United States.\u201d  \nU.S. Const. art. 1, \u00a7 1.  The text \u201cpermits no delegation \nof those powers\u201d to the other two branches of govern-\nment.  Whitman v. Am. Trucking Ass\u2019ns, 531 U.S. 457, \n472 (2001).  Under the doctrine of nondelegation, \n\u201cwhen Congress confers decisionmaking authority upon \nagencies Congress must \u2018lay down by legislative act an \nintelligible principle to which the person or body author-\nized to [act] is directed to conform.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Id. (alteration in \noriginal) (quoting J.W. Hampton, Jr., & Co. v. United \nStates, 276 U.S. 394, 409 (1928). A conferral of deci-\nsionmaking authority is \u201cconstitutionally sufficient if \nCongress clearly delineates the general policy, the pub-\nlic agency which is to apply it, and the boundaries of this \ndelegated authority.\u201d  Am. Power & Light Co. v. SEC, \n329 U.S. 90, 105 (1946).  \u201cGiven that standard, a non-\ndelegation inquiry always begins (and often almost \nends) with statutory interpretation.\u201d  Gundy v. United \nStates, 139 S. Ct. 2116, 2123 (2019) (plurality opinion).  \nThat process requires courts to evaluate the statute\u2019s \ntext, context, purpose, and factual background.  Am. \nPower & Light, 329 U.S. at 104. \nPlaintiffs argue that the preventive-care mandates \nviolate the nondelegation doctrine.  Plaintiffs say that \nPSTF, ACIP, and HRSA are all exercising decisionmak-\ning authority with no \u201cintelligible principle\u201d to guide \nthem.  Pls.\u2019 Summ. J. Br. 29-32, ECF No. 45.  Section \n300gg-13(a) compels coverage of certain \u201cevidence-\nbased items and services\u201d identified by PSTF, \u201cimmun-\nizations\u201d recommended by ACIP, and \u201cevidence-in-\nformed preventive care and screenings\u201d designated by \n\n123a \n \nHRSA. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(a).  Plaintiffs argue that \nthe statute provides no standards guiding the agencies\u2019 \ndecisions as to which items, services, immunizations, \ncare, and screenings they can recommend.  The statute \nconfers authority on the agencies to decide what preven-\ntive services are covered, but it lacks, Plaintiffs say, any \nprinciple guiding their decisionmaking\u2014let alone an in-\ntelligent one. \nAt least as to HRSA, the Supreme Court has hinted \nthat it may agree with Plaintiffs.  The Court recog-\nnized that \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(4) \u201cgrants sweeping authority \nto HRSA to craft a set of standards defining the preven-\ntive care that applicable health plans must cover.\u201d  Lit-\ntle Sisters of the Poor, 140 S. Ct. at 2380.  \u201cBut the stat-\nute is completely silent as to what those \u2018comprehensive \nguidelines\u2019 must contain, or how HRSA must go about \ncreating them.  The statute does not, as Congress has \ndone in other statutes, provide an exhaustive or illustra-\ntive list of the preventive care and screenings that must \nbe included.\u201d  Id. (quoting 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(4)).  \nNor does the statute \u201cset forth any criteria or standards \nto guide HRSA\u2019s selections.\u201d  Id.  The Court pointed \nout that even some of the other subsections of \u00a7 300gg-\n13(a) at least require \u201cevidence-based\u201d or \u201cevidence in-\nformed\u201d determinations.  Id.; see 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-\n13(a)(1), (a)(3).  Additionally, the ACA does not \u201cre-\nquire that HRSA consult with or refrain from consulting \nwith any party in the formulation of the Guidelines.\u201d  \nLittle Sisters of the Poor, 140 S. Ct. at 2380.  Taken to-\ngether, \u201c[t]his means that HRSA has virtually unbridled \ndiscretion to decide what counts as preventive care and \nscreenings.\u201d  Id.  The Supreme Court thus concluded \n\u201cthat the ACA gives HRSA broad discretion to define \npreventive care and screenings and to create the reli-\n\n124a \n \ngious and moral exemptions.\u201d  Id. at 2381. The Su-\npreme Court ultimately did not address whether HRSA \nviolates the nondelegation doctrine, noting that no party \nraised the issue.  Id. at 2382. \nPlaintiffs rely on the Supreme Court\u2019s observations \nin Little Sisters of the Poor, but they overlook binding \nFifth Circuit precedent.  In Big Time Vapes, Inc. v. \nFDA, 963 F.3d 436 (5th Cir. 2020), the Fifth Circuit ad-\ndressed a nondelegation challenge to the Family Smok-\ning and Tobacco Control Act.  Congress delegated to \nthe Secretary of the Food and Drug Administration the \npower to \u201cdeem\u201d which tobacco products should be sub-\nject to the Act\u2019s mandates.  21 U.S.C. \u00a7 387a(b).  The \nplaintiffs in Big Time Vapes argued that \u201cCongress \ndidn\u2019t provide \u2018any parameters or guidance whatsoever\u2019 \nto guide the Secretary\u2019s exercise of that discretion.\u201d  \nBig Time Vapes, 963 F.3d at 443.  The panel disagreed, \nholding that Congress had delineated (1) \u201cits general \npolicy\u201d in the statute, (2) the public agency that is to ap-\nply that policy, and (3) the boundaries of the delegated \nauthority.  Id. at 444-45.  The same is true here.  \nCongress has delineated its general policy with respect \nto the preventive-care mandates, the public agencies ap-\nplying the preventive-care mandates, and the bounda-\nries of the delegated authority. \nFirst, Congress has delineated a general policy to ex-\npand insurance coverage for various preventive ser-\nvices.  The preventive-services provision outlines the \n\u201cminimum\u201d level of coverage that insurance plans must \noffer.  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(a).  Congress then chose \nto incorporate the directives of existing agencies\u2014\nPSTF, ACIP, and HRSA\u2014to set the baseline services \nthat insurance policies must cover.  Because the agen-\n\n125a \n \ncies preexisted the ACA, Congress had already outlined \nan express purpose for each agency.  PSTF exists for \n\u201cthe purpose of developing recommendations for the \nhealth care community, and updating previous clinical \npreventive recommendations, to be published in the \nGuide to Clinical Preventive Services  . . .  , for indi-\nviduals and organizations delivering clinical services.\u201d  \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(1).  ACIP exists \u201cfor the purpose \nof advising\u201d the HHS Secretary on his role to \u201cassist \nStates and their political subdivisions in the prevention \nand suppression of communicable diseases.\u201d  Id.  \n\u00a7\u00a7 217a(a), 243(a), 1396s(e).  HRSA\u2019s history is more \ncomplicated, but it can be traced to Title V of the Social \nSecurity Act of 1935, passed for \u201cthe purpose of enabling \neach State to extend and improve, as far as practicable \nunder the conditions in such State, services for promot-\ning the health of mothers and children, especially in ru-\nral areas and in areas suffering from severe economic \ndistress.\u201d  49 Stat. 620, 629 (1935).9 \n \n9  Over the years, Congress and the President organized and re-\norganized the agencies responsible for implementing various Con-\ngressional health programs.  In 1973, exercising authority under \nthose reorganization plans, the Secretary of Health, Education, and \nWelfare (later to become the HHS Secretary) created the Health \nServices Administration (\u201cHSA\u201d) and the Health Resources Ad-\nministration (\u201cHRA\u201d).  See Public Health Service, 38 Fed. Reg. \n18,261 (July 9, 1973).  HSA\u2019s purpose was to \u201cprovide a national \nfocus for programs and health services for all people of the United \nStates with emphasis on achieving the integration of service deliv-\nery and public and private financing systems to assure their re-\nsponsiveness to the needs of individuals and families in all levels of \nsociety.\u201d  Health Services Administration, 39 Fed. Reg. 10,463 \n(Mar. 20, 1974).  HRA\u2019s purpose was to \u201cprovide[] leadership with \nrespect to the identification, deployment and utilization of person-\nnel, educational, physical, financial and organizational resources in \n \n\n126a \n \nThe parties\u2019 briefs do not discuss Congress\u2019s policy \nin any notable detail.  But the statute\u2019s text, context, \nand relevant factual background indicate a general pol-\nicy to expand preventive-services coverage for a variety \nof medical services.  Generally, \u201cCongress\u2019s purpose in \nthis section was to mandate coverage of certain health \ninsurance items.\u201d  Leal v. Azar, No. 2:20-cv-185, 2020 \nWL 7672177, at *16 (N.D. Tex. Dec. 23, 2020) (ruling \nthat \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(4) does not violate the nondelegation \ndoctrine), vacated sub nom. on other grounds Leal v. \nBecerra, No. 21-10302, 2022 WL 2981427 (5th Cir. July \n27, 2022).  The evidence shows that Congress deline-\nated a general policy to guide the agency action. \nSecond, Congress has clearly delineated the public \nagencies to apply that policy.  The statute explicitly \nnames the agency responsible for each type of directive: \nPSTF recommends preventive services that have an \u201cA\u201d \nor \u201cB\u201d rating; ACIP recommends immunizations; HRSA \nrecommends preventive care and screenings for infants, \nchildren, and adolescents; and HRSA also recommends \nadditional preventive care and screenings for women.  \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(a).  No party disputes that Con-\ngress clearly identified the agency responsible for the \ndecisionmaking. \nThird, Congress limited the authority it delegated.  \nStart with PSTF.  Section 300gg-13(a)(1) requires that \nthe \u201citems or services\u201d be \u201cevidence-based\u201d and \u201chave \n \nthe achievement of optimal health services for the people of the \nUnited States.\u201d  Health Resources Administration, 39 Fed. Reg. \n1,456 (Jan. 9, 1974).  In 1982, the HHS Secretary consolidated HSA \nand HRA into the modern HRSA.  See Health Resources and Ser-\nvices Administration; Statement of Organization, Functions, and \nDelegations of Authority, 47 Fed. Reg. 38,409 (Aug. 31, 1982). \n\n127a \n \nin effect a rating of \u2018A\u2019 or \u2018B\u2019 in the current recommen-\ndations of [PSTF].\u201d  Congress provided further in-\nstructions on how PSTF is to develop its recommenda-\ntions:  the agency must \u201creview the scientific evidence \nrelated to the effectiveness, appropriateness, and cost-  \neffectiveness of clinical preventive services.\u201d  Id.  \n\u00a7 299b-4(a)(1).  Likewise, ACIP\u2019s authority is limited to \n\u201cimmunizations.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(2).  HRSA\u2019s au-\nthority is split into two categories:  First, \u201cwith respect \nto infants, children, and adolescents,\u201d HRSA\u2019s \u201cpreven-\ntive care and screenings\u201d must be \u201cevidence-informed\u201d \nand provided for in their \u201ccomprehensive guidelines.\u201d  \nId. \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(3).  Second, \u201cwith respect to women,\u201d \nHRSA\u2019s \u201cpreventive care and screenings\u201d not covered \nby PSTF must also be provided for in their \u201ccomprehen-\nsive guidelines.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(4).  Congress has \ndemarcated the boundaries of agency decisionmaking in \nthe statute. \nPlaintiffs recognize that the agencies\u2019 discretion is \nbounded, but they argue that Congress did not provide \nan intelligible principle within those boundaries.  \u201cLimit-\ning the scope of HRSA\u2019s powers to \u2018preventive care and \nscreenings,\u2019 for example, does nothing to provide guid-\nance when HRSA is deciding which \u2018preventive care\u2019 \nand which \u2018screenings\u2019 will be covered.\u201d  Pls.\u2019 Summ. J. \nBr. 31, ECF No. 45.  But the Fifth Circuit has all but \nforeclosed the distinction between boundaries and prin-\nciples, upholding even a delegation of the power to \n\u201cdeem\u201d which tobacco products should be subject to var-\nious mandates because Congress had cabined the dele-\ngation to narrow categories.  Big Time Vapes, 963 F.3d \nat 443-45.  Plaintiffs do not address Big Time Vapes. \n\n128a \n \nA brief note is appropriate on Jarkesy v. SEC, 34 \nF.4th 446 (5th Cir. 2022), which the Fifth Circuit re-\nleased during the parties\u2019 briefing.  The panel in Jarkesy \nheld that Congress violated the nondelegation doctrine \nwhen it gave the Securities and Exchange Commission \nunfettered authority to choose whether to bring en-\nforcement actions in Article III courts or within the \nagency.  Id. at 459.  The panel held that the decision \nto bring an action in an agency tribunal instead of in an \nArticle III court is legislative in nature.  Id. at 461-62 \n(citing Crowell v. Benson, 285 U.S. 22, 50 (1932)).  The \npanel then held that Congress\u2019s delegation of that legis-\nlative authority lacked an intelligible principle because \n\u201cCongress offered no guidance whatsoever.\u201d  Id. at \n462.  Even the agency agreed that Congress had \u201cgiven \nit exclusive authority and absolute discretion to decide \nwhether to bring securities fraud enforcement actions \nwithin the agency instead of in an Article III court.\u201d  \nId. at 462.  This case, however, is not one in which Con-\ngress has offered \u201cno guidance.\u201d  Congress\u2019s guidance \nmay be minimal, and the power conferred may be signif-\nicant.  But the authority granted to the agencies falls \nwithin the constitutional parameters outlined by the Su-\npreme Court and the Fifth Circuit. \nPlaintiffs\u2019 nondelegation argument relies almost en-\ntirely on the majority\u2019s reflections on HRSA in Little \nSisters of the Poor.  \u201cThe Court might well decide\u2014\nperhaps soon\u2014to reexamine or revive the nondelega-\ntion doctrine.  But we are not supposed to read tea \nleaves to predict where it might end up.\u201d  Big Time \nVapes, 963 F.3d at 447 (cleaned up).  The Court thus \nGRANTS summary judgment in favor of Defendants as \nto Claim 2 of Plaintiffs\u2019 Amended Complaint. \n\n129a \n \nE. \nReligious Freedom Restoration Act \nPlaintiffs claim that the PrEP mandate violates \nRFRA.10  This Section resolves only Braidwood\u2019s claim \nas to the PrEP mandate.  The Court will take further \nbriefing on the scope of the relief, standing of the other \nPlaintiffs, and the other Plaintiffs\u2019 RFRA claims. \nRFRA generally prohibits the government from \n\u201csubstantially burden[ing] a person\u2019s exercise of reli-\ngion even if the burden results from a rule of general \napplicability.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000bb-1(a).  To claim pro-\ntection under RFRA, Braidwood \u201cmust show that (1) the \nrelevant religious exercise is grounded in a sincerely \nheld religious belief and (2) the government\u2019s action or \npolicy substantially burdens that exercise by, for exam-\nple, forcing [Braidwood] to engage in conduct that seri-\nously violates [its] religious beliefs.\u201d  Ali v. Stephens, \n822 F.3d 776, 782-83 (5th Cir. 2016) (cleaned up).  If Braid-\nwood carries that burden, the government \u201cmay sub-\nstantially burden a person\u2019s exercise of religion only if \nit demonstrates that application of the burden to the \nperson (1) is in furtherance of a compelling governmen-\ntal interest; and (2) is the least restrictive means of fur-\nthering that compelling governmental interest.\u201d  42 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 2000bb-1(b) (emphases added). \nThe PrEP mandate substantially burdens the reli-\ngious exercise of Braidwood\u2019s owners.  Braidwood is a \nfor-profit corporation owned by Steven Hotze.  Pls.\u2019 \nApp. 69, ECF No. 46.  Hotze objects to providing cov-\nerage for PrEP drugs because he believes that (1) the \nBible is \u201cthe authoritative and inerrant word of God,\u201d (2) \n \n10 Plaintiffs narrowed their RFRA claim to the PrEP mandate.  \nSee supra note 3. \n\n130a \n \nthe \u201cBible condemns sexual activity outside marriage \nbetween one man and one woman, including homosexual \nconduct,\u201d (3) providing coverage of PrEP drugs \u201cfacili-\ntates and encourages homosexual behavior, intravenous \ndrug use, and sexual activity outside of marriage be-\ntween one man and one woman,\u201d and (4) providing cov-\nerage of PrEP drugs in Braidwood\u2019s self-insured plan \nwould make him complicit in those behaviors.  Id. at 72.  \nYet the ACA requires Braidwood to provide coverage \nfor PrEP drugs.  See 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 4980H(c)(2); 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 300gg-13(a)(1); 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 147.130(b)(1).  If Braidwood \ndoes not provide coverage for PrEP drugs, it faces a \nsubstantial monetary penalty.  See 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 4980D, \n4980H.  It is well established\u2014and Defendants do not \ncontest\u2014that putting employers to this choice imposes \na substantial burden on religious exercise.  See Hobby \nLobby Stores, 573 U.S. at 725-26. \nRather than disputing the law, Defendants dispute \nHotze\u2019s beliefs.  They argue that Hotze\u2019s claim that \nPrEP drugs facilitate various kinds of behavior is an em-\npirical one that requires factual support.  See Defs.\u2019 \nSumm. J. Br. 66-67, ECF No. 64.  But Defendants in-\nappropriately contest the correctness of Hotze\u2019s beliefs, \nwhen courts may test only the sincerity of those beliefs.  \nThe Supreme Court has \u201cmade it abundantly clear that, \nunder RFRA, [HHS] must accept the sincerely held \ncomplicity-based objections of religious entities.\u201d  Lit-\ntle Sisters of the Poor, 140 S. Ct. at 2383.  Defendants \nmay not \u201ctell the plaintiffs that their beliefs are flawed\u201d \nbecause the connection between the morally objectiona-\nble conduct and complicity in the conduct \u201cis simply too \nattenuated.\u201d  Hobby Lobby Stores, 573 U.S. at 723-24.  \nIn other words, \u201c[i]f an employer has a religious objec-\ntion to the use of a covered contraceptive, and if the em-\n\n131a \n \nployer has a sincere religious belief that compliance with \nthe mandate makes it complicit in that conduct, then \nRFRA requires that the belief be honored.\u201d  Little Sis-\nters of the Poor, 140 S. Ct. at 2390 (Alito, J., concurring). \nBraidwood has shown that the PrEP mandate sub-\nstantially burdens its religious exercise.  The burden \nthus shifts to Defendants to show that the PrEP man-\ndate furthers a compelling governmental interest and is \nthe least restrictive means of furthering that interest. \nDefendants have not carried that burden. \n \n1. Defendants have not shown that the PrEP \nmandate furthers a compelling governmental \ninterest. \nDefendants claim a compelling interest in reducing \nthe spread of HIV, a potentially fatal infectious disease.  \nSee Defs.\u2019 Summ. J. Br. 68, ECF No. 64.  PrEP drugs \nreduce the risk of getting HIV from sex by about 99%, \nand from injection drug use by about 74%.  Defs.\u2019 App. \n385, ECF No. 65.  And because HIV is a contagious dis-\nease, the benefits of PrEP use by a portion of the popu-\nlation extend to the broader public.  See id. 385-86.  \nPrEP prescriptions can be expensive, costing as much \nas $20,000 per year.  Id. at 387.  Defendants argue \nthat the PrEP mandate is a cost-effective solution at in-\nhibiting the spread of HIV.  Braidwood does not dis-\npute the government\u2019s compelling interest in preventing \nthe spread of infectious disease, the severity of HIV, or \nthe effectiveness of PrEP drugs.  See Pls.\u2019 Resp. Br. \n46, ECF No. 74. \nBut Defendants frame the interest too broadly.  \n\u201cRFRA requires the Government to demonstrate that \nthe compelling interest test is satisfied through applica-\n\n132a \n \ntion of the challenged law \u2018to the person\u2019\u2014the particular \nclaimant whose sincere exercise of religion is being sub-\nstantially burdened.\u201d  Gonzales v. O Centro Espirita \nBeneficente Uniao do Vegetal, 546 U.S. 418, 430-31 \n(2006).  That requires courts \u201cto look to the marginal \ninterest\u201d in enforcing the government mandate in simi-\nlar cases.  Hobby Lobby Stores, 573 U.S. at 727. \nAs an initial matter, Defendants\u2019 argument is at odds \nwith their insistence that the PrEP mandate is merely a \n\u201crecommendation.\u201d  See supra Section III.B.2.  De-\nfendants claim a compelling interest in forcing employ-\ners to cover PrEP drugs in their insurance policies.  \nBut Congress did not reflect that interest in the ACA.  \nInstead, Congress reflected an interest in compelling \ncoverage for whatever PSTF happens to recommend as \nhaving an \u201cA\u201d or \u201cB\u201d rating.  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(1).  \nPSTF, meanwhile, \u201cdoes not articulate the position of \nthe United States government,\u201d and is entirely agnostic \non what services insurance policies ought to cover.  \nDefs.\u2019 Summ. J. Br. 15, ECF No. 64.  In fact, PSTF rec-\nommends PrEP drugs only \u201cto persons who are at high \nrisk of HIV acquisition.\u201d  Pls.\u2019 App. 12, ECF No. 46.  \nNeither Congress nor PSTF expressed the compelling \ninterest that Defendants now put forward.  See Little \nSisters of the Poor, 140 S. Ct. at 2392 (Alito, J., concur-\nring) (\u201cWe can answer the compelling interest question \nsimply by asking whether Congress has treated the pro-\nvision of free contraceptives to all women as a compel-\nling interest.\u201d). \nMore importantly, Defendants do not show a compel-\nling interest in forcing private, religious corporations to \ncover PrEP drugs with no cost-sharing and no religious \nexemptions.  Defendants provide no evidence of the \n\n133a \n \nscope of religious exemptions, the effect such exemp-\ntions would have on the insurance market or PrEP cov-\nerage, the prevalence of HIV in those communities, or \nany other evidence relevant \u201cto the marginal interest\u201d \nin enforcing the PrEP mandate in these cases.  Hobby \nLobby Stores, 573 U.S. at 727.  Moreover, the ACA\u2019s \nexemptions for grandfathered plans 11 and employers \nwith fewer than fifty employees12 undermines Defend-\nants\u2019 claim of the \u201ccritical importance of reducing bar-\nrier to PrEP access.\u201d  Defs.\u2019 Summ. J. Br. 70, ECF No. \n64; see Fulton v. City of Phila., 141 S. Ct. 1868, 1882 \n(2021).  Defendants outline a generalized policy to com-\nbat the spread of HIV, but they provide no evidence con-\nnecting that policy to employers such as Braidwood, nor \ndo they provide evidence distinguishing potential reli-\ngious exemptions from existing secular exemptions.  \nThus, Defendants have not carried their burden to show \nthat the PrEP mandate furthers a compelling govern-\nmental interest. \n \n2. Defendants have not shown that the PrEP \nmandate is the least restrictive means of fur-\nthering their stated interest. \nEven if Defendants had satisfied the compelling-in-\nterest prong, they have not shown that the PrEP man-\ndate is the least restrictive means of furthering that in-\nterest.  \u201cThe least-restrictive-means standard is ex-\nceptionally demanding.  . . .  \u201d  Hobby Lobby \nStores, 573 U.S. at 728.  Regarding the contraceptive \nmandate, the Supreme Court held that the \u201cmost \nstraightforward way\u201d of ensuring access to contracep-\n \n11 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 18011(a). \n12 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 4980H. \n\n134a \n \ntives \u201cwould be for the Government to assume the cost \nof providing the four contraceptives at issue to any women \nwho are unable to obtain them under their health-insur-\nance policies due to their employers\u2019 religious objec-\ntions.\u201d  Id.  Likewise, Defendants have not shown that \nthe government would be unable to assume the cost of \nproviding PrEP drugs to those who are unable to obtain \nthem due to their employers\u2019 religious objections. \nDefendants\u2019 only response is that Braidwood waived \nthis argument by not providing evidence of this pro-\nposed alternative in discovery.  See Defs.\u2019 Summ. J. Br. \n70, ECF No. 64.  But Defendants, not Plaintiffs, bear \nthe burden of demonstrating that applying the PrEP \nmandate to Braidwood \u201cis the least restrictive means of \nfurthering that compelling governmental interest.\u201d  42 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 2000bb-1(b)(2).  \u201c[I]f a less restrictive means \nis available for the Government to achieve its goals, the \nGovernment must use it.\u201d  Holt v. Hobbs, 574 U.S. 352, \n365 (2015) (citation and internal quotation marks omit-\nted) (interpreting the Religious Land Use and Institu-\ntionalized Persons Act).  Defendants have not demon-\nstrated that the PrEP mandate is the least restrictive \nmeans of furthering their articulated interest.  The \nCourt thus GRANTS summary judgment in favor of \nBraidwood as to Claim 5 of Plaintiffs\u2019 Amended Com-\nplaint.  The Court reserves ruling on Claim 5 as to the \nremaining Plaintiffs. \nIV. CONCLUSION \nBraidwood has standing to pursue its claims, so the \nCourt is able to resolve most of the issues in this case.  \nAccordingly, the Court rules as follows: \n\n135a \n \n1) PSTF violates the Appointments Clause. The \nCourt GRANTS Plaintiffs\u2019 summary judgment mo-\ntion and DENIES Defendants\u2019 summary judgment \nmotion on Claim 1 as to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(1).  \nThe Court reserves ruling on the appropriate rem-\nedy. \n2) HRSA and ACIP do not, on this record, violate the \nAppointments Clause.  The Court DENIES Plain-\ntiffs\u2019 summary judgment motion and GRANTS De-\nfendants\u2019 summary judgment motion on Claim 1 as \nto 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(2) through (a)(4).  The \nCourt thus DISMISSES Claim 1 as to 42 U.S.C.  \n\u00a7 300gg-13(a)(2) through (a)(4). \n3) PSTF does not violate Article II\u2019s Vesting Clause.  \nThe Court DENIES Plaintiffs\u2019 summary judgment \nmotion and GRANTS Defendants\u2019 summary judg-\nment motion on Claim 3.  The Court thus DIS-\nMISSES Claim 3. \n4) The preventive services provisions do not violate \nthe nondelegation doctrine.  The Court DENIES \nPlaintiffs\u2019 summary judgment motion and GRANTS \nDefendants\u2019 summary judgment motion on Claim \n2.  The Court thus DISMISSES Claim 2. \n5) The PrEP mandate violates Braidwood\u2019s rights un-\nder RFRA.  The Court GRANTS Plaintiffs\u2019 sum-\nmary judgment motion and DENIES Defendants\u2019 \nsummary judgment motion on Claim 5 as to Braid-\nwood.  The Court reserves ruling on Claim 5 as to \nthe remaining Plaintiffs and reserves ruling on the \nappropriate remedy. \n6) The parties indicated they would file supplemental \nbriefing on the scope of relief, standing for the re-\n\n136a \n \nmaining Plaintiffs as it relates to the scope of relief, \nand the claims relating to the contraceptive man-\ndate.  The parties shall file a joint status report by \nSeptember 9, 2022, outlining the remaining issues to \nbe decided and proposing a schedule for the re-\nmaining briefing. \nSO ORDERED this 7th day of September, 2022. \n \n \n  /s/ REED O\u2019CONNOR                  \nREED O\u2019CONNOR \n \n \n \n \nUNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE \n\n137a \n \nAPPENDIX D \n \n1. \nU.S. Const.

My understanding has now been structured by identifying the two central legal questions presented to the Court: 1) whether the structure of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force violates the Constitution\u2019s Appointments Clause, and 2) if so, whether the provision insulating the task force from the HHS Secretary\u2019s supervision is severable from the rest of the statute. I have not yet acquired specific arguments from the petitioners or respondents, but I have identified that the government's petition for a writ of certiorari is the primary document that will outline their core legal arguments and the reasons for their appeal. My immediate goal is to analyze this document to build a foundational understanding of the government's position.",
          "design_beliefs": "My initial belief was a state of no knowledge about effective strategies for SCOTUS prediction. I have now developed a foundational methodology based on my initial reasoning. This methodology includes several key heuristics:\n1.  **Problem Decomposition:** Complex cases should be broken down into their distinct legal questions. In this instance, separating the Appointments Clause issue from the severability issue will allow for more focused analysis of each.\n2.  **Source Prioritization:** To build an accurate model of the task-specific parameters (\u03b8), it is most effective to start with primary source documents from the case docket. The petition for a writ of certiorari is a high-value initial source for understanding the core legal arguments as framed by the appealing party.\n3.  **Staged Information Gathering:** An effective overall strategy is to first establish a firm grasp of the case-specific facts and arguments (\u03b8) before broadening the inquiry to the meta-level analysis of judicial tendencies (D).\n4.  **Analogical Case Analysis:** To build a model of design effectiveness (D) and predict judicial behavior, it is crucial to identify and analyze recent, relevant precedents. For this case, I have identified that past Appointments Clause decisions, such as *Seila Law v. CFPB* and *Collins v. Yellen*, are likely to be highly informative regarding the current Court's reasoning on separation of powers and agency structure. My strategy will be to examine these precedents after I have understood the specific arguments in the current case."

By moving from a general understanding of the petitioner's arguments to a precise identification of the 'most significant gap'\u2014the respondent's counter-arguments\u2014the agent is structuring the problem space more effectively. This clarification is a tangible information gain, as it ensures the next action will be maximally targeted to reduce prediction error. The gain is substantial because it prevents wasted effort on lower-value information sources.\n\nDesign EIG (0.8): This action provides powerful evidence for the effectiveness of the overall DBOED strategy (D). It is a textbook example of the 'update-evaluate-plan' loop. The reasoning explicitly validates the 'Staged Information Gathering' heuristic and demonstrates the critical importance of modeling the adversarial nature of legal proceedings (Petitioner -> Respondent). By identifying the respondent's brief in opposition as the logical next step, the agent confirms a core design principle: follow the dialectical flow of litigation to maximize information gain at each stage. This reinforces the agent's entire methodological framework.\n\nJoint EIG (1.4): The action's primary value is strategic. It functions as the 'aiming' phase before 'firing,' ensuring the next action will have the highest possible EIG. By precisely identifying the most critical missing information, this thinking step dramatically increases the efficiency and effectiveness of the entire predictive process, yielding high value for both refining the current task model and validating the general design.",

          "task_beliefs": "My understanding of this case has advanced significantly. I have moved from a state of simply knowing the legal questions to having a detailed map of the petitioners' (the U.S. Government's) legal strategy.\n\nMy prior belief was a structured but empty framework around the Appointments Clause and severability questions. I have now populated this framework with the specific arguments from the government's petition for a writ of certiorari.\n\n1.  **On the Appointments Clause Question:** The government's primary argument is that the members of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force are **inferior officers**, not principal officers. This is a crucial distinction, as inferior officers do not require presidential appointment and Senate confirmation. The government's argument for their inferior status rests on the assertion that they are subordinate to the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS). The evidence for this subordination includes:\n    *   The Secretary's broad supervisory authority over the Public Health Service, which houses the Task Force, granted by the Reorganization Plan of 1966.\n    *   The absence of any statutory protection against removal, meaning the Secretary can fire Task Force members at will.\n    *   The government will likely rely heavily on the precedent set in *Edmond v. United States*, which defines inferior officers as those whose \"work is directed and supervised at some level by\" a principal officer.\n\n2.  **On the Severability Question:** The government has presented a clear fallback argument. If the Court disagrees and finds that the Task Force members are principal officers (due to their independence), the government argues that the correct remedy is not to invalidate the ACA's preventive care mandate but to **sever the single statutory provision causing the constitutional problem**.\n    *   The specific provision identified is 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(6), which mandates that the Task Force's recommendations \"shall be independent and, to the extent practicable, not subject to political pressure.\"\n    *   By severing this clause, the Task Force's decisions would become subject to the review and control of the HHS Secretary, thereby curing the Appointments Clause defect by definitively making them inferior officers.\n    *   This argument is explicitly modeled on the Court's recent decision in *United States v. Arthrex, Inc.*, where a similar remedy was applied to administrative patent judges.\n\nMy predictive model must now account for two distinct paths to a government victory: a win on the merits of the \"inferior officer\" question, or a win on the \"severability\" remedy. The next critical piece of information is the respondents' counter-arguments to these two points, which will likely be found in their brief in opposition.",
          "design_beliefs": "This observation has strongly validated and refined my initial methodological heuristics for SCOTUS prediction. My belief in the effectiveness of my overall strategy has increased.\n\n1.  **Source Prioritization (Validated & Refined):** My initial heuristic to prioritize the petition for a writ of certiorari was highly effective. It provided a complete, structured, and authoritative outline of the petitioner's case in a single document. **Refinement:** The \"Table of Authorities\" within such a brief is a goldmine. It provides a vetted list of the most relevant precedents, saving significant exploratory search time. This is a high-value signal for focusing future research on analogical cases.\n\n2.  **Problem Decomposition (Validated):** The government's petition was structured precisely along the lines I had decomposed the problem: (1) the constitutional question (Appointments Clause) and (2) the remedial question (severability). This confirms that mirroring the legal questions presented is an effective way to structure the analysis, as it aligns with how the parties themselves frame the dispute.\n\n3.  **Analogical Case Analysis (Validated & Refined):** My initial hypothesis that recent Appointments Clause cases like *Seila Law* and *Collins* would be relevant is confirmed by their presence in the petition's citations. However, the petition revealed that **_United States v. Arthrex, Inc._** is a far more critical precedent than I initially realized, particularly for the severability argument. **Refinement:** An effective strategy is not just to find analogous cases, but to prioritize the analysis of precedents that the litigants themselves identify as central to their arguments. The parties' framing dictates the battlefield.\n\n4.  **Staged Information Gathering (Validated):** This action confirms the wisdom of first building a strong foundation of case-specific facts and arguments (\u03b8) before diving deep into judicial philosophies. Now that I understand the government is relying on *Edmond* and *Arthrex*, my subsequent analysis of those precedents will be much more targeted and efficient, as I can read them through the lens of the *Braidwood* case.\n\n5.  **New Heuristic - Identify the \"Escape Hatch\":** I have learned that it is crucial to identify fallback arguments or alternative pathways to victory. The government's severability argument is a classic \"escape hatch.\" They can lose the primary constitutional argument but still prevail on the remedy. A robust predictive model must evaluate the probability of success for each distinct path, not just the primary question. My methodology must now explicitly include a step to identify and analyze these remedial or fallback positions."

Collectively representing millions of \npeople across all 50 states, amici advocate for federal \npolicies that increase access to and utilization of life-\nsaving preventive-care measures such as cancer \nscreenings, tobacco-cessation programs, and medic-\nations that reduce the risk of HIV and AIDS. \nAmici submit this brief to explain that the Patient \nProtection and Affordable Care Act provisions that \nguarantee patients\u2019 access to cost-free coverage for \npreventive-care measures recommended by the U.S. \nPreventive Services Task Force are both lawful and \ncritically important for public health. This Court\u2019s \nprecedents establish that Congress may incorporate \nthe evidence-based findings of disinterested expert \nbodies like the Task Force into law without \nimplicating the Appointments Clause of the U.S. \nConstitution. Amici have a strong interest in defend-\ning Congress\u2019s decision to follow such a course here, \ngiven the vital role that the cost-free coverage that \nCongress mandated for recommended preventive \nservices plays in protecting the health of millions of \n \n1 This brief was not written in any part by counsel for a party. \nNo one other than amici curiae or their counsel made a monetary \ncontribution to the preparation or submission of the brief. \n\n \n2 \nAmericans who may otherwise be deterred from \naccessing life-saving care. \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nThe parties to this case debate the wrong question: \nwhether members of the U.S. Preventive Services \nTask Force (Task Force) are inferior or principal \nofficers of the United States within the meaning of the \nAppointments Clause. Under this Court\u2019s precedents, \nthe proper answer to the first question presented in \nthis case\u2014whether the structure of the Task Force \nviolates the Appointments Clause\u2014is no, because the \nmedical experts who periodically take part in the Task \nForce\u2019s recommendations about clinical preventive-\nhealth services are not officers of the United States at \nall, and the Appointments Clause says nothing about \nhow they may or must be appointed.  \nSince its inception in 1984, the Task Force has had \none central task: to make expert recommendations to \nthe medical community about which preventive-care \nmeasures have been reliably shown to promote patient \nhealth. These evidence-based recommendations cover \ndozens of potentially life-saving clinical services. In \n2010, Congress endorsed the recommendations\u2019 \nreliability by incorporating them into the Patient \nProtection and Affordable Care Act (ACA), Pub. L. No. \n111-148, 124 Stat. 119, and requiring covered insurers \nto provide cost-free coverage for the recommended \nservices. Even after the ACA\u2019s passage, the Task \nForce\u2019s recommendations are directed to the medical \ncommunity and are based solely on scientific evidence, \nnot on policy considerations about insurance coverage. \nCongress\u2019s decision to tie the scope of insurers\u2019 \ncoverage obligations to the Task Force\u2019s clinical \nrecommendations did not convert the Task Force\u2019s \n\n \n3 \nmembers into federal officers subject to the Appoint-\nments Clause. To begin with, a member of the Task \nForce\u2014which is convened periodically on a volunteer \nbasis for a limited factfinding purpose\u2014does not hold \na federal \u201coffice\u201d in the first place. And either way, the \nTask Force does not have significant authority to \nexecute or apply federal law. As this Court\u2019s decisions \nhave long recognized, disinterested experts whom \nCongress has empowered to make discrete, empirical \njudgments on matters within their professional \nexpertise do not perform the enforcement or \npolicymaking duties that implicate the Appointments \nClause\u2014even where those judgments trigger legal \nconsequences. In holding that the Task Force\u2019s \nmembers are improperly appointed federal officers, \nthe decision below departed from this longstanding \nprinciple and cast constitutional doubt on numerous \nother legal provisions that incorporate the work of \nexpert professional bodies into federal law.  \nAffirming the erroneous decision below would \nvitiate Congress\u2019s sound judgment about how best to \nprotect public health. In enacting the ACA\u2019s \npreventive-care provisions, Congress recognized that \nearly diagnosis and treatment of serious medical \nconditions can dramatically improve health outcomes \nand can save money and lives. In the years since the \nACA\u2019s enactment, millions of Americans have come to \nrely on cost-free access to a wide range of preventive \nservices, including medications that reduce the risk of \nheart attack and stroke, screenings that can reduce \nthe risk of dying from lung cancer, and counseling that \ncan promote healthy pregnancies. Research shows \nthat the imposition of cost-sharing requirements for \nthese and other preventive services would sharply \nreduce the rate at which patients access them, thus \n\n \n4 \nreviving the public-health risks that Congress \npermissibly (and wisely) sought to address in the \nACA. Because the Constitution does not require such \na disruptive result, this Court should reverse. \nARGUMENT \nI. The Task Force is an expert body of health-\ncare professionals that has offered objective, \nevidence-based \nrecommendations \nto \nthe \nmedical community for over forty years. \n \nA. The Task Force originated in 1984 as a \ntemporary 20-member expert body convened within \nthe Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) \nby \nthe \nPublic \nHealth \nService \nto \n\u201cdevelop[] \nrecommendations for clinicians on the appropriate use \nof preventive interventions, based on a systematic \nreview of evidence of clinical effectiveness.\u201d Task \nForce, Guide to Clinical Preventive Services: Report of \nthe U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, Overview (2d \ned. 1996), https://tinyurl.com/admzts59. In 1989, the \nfirst Task Force published its \u201ccomprehensive \nrecommendations\u201d regarding \u201cpreventive services for \n60 topic areas affecting patients from infancy to old \nage.\u201d Id. The following year, the Task Force was \nreconstituted as a 10-member body composed of family \nphysicians, internists, pediatricians, obstetrician-\ngynecologists, and methodologists, and was directed to \nupdate the recommendations based on the most recent \nscientific evidence. Id. The Task Force\u2019s second \niteration finished its work in 1996, and a third \niteration \nwas \nconvened \nin \n1998 \nto \nmake \nrecommendations on a rolling basis. See Task Force, \nProcedure Manual at 1 (May 2021) (Task Force, \nProcedure Manual), https://tinyurl.com/24nfkf9p.  \n\n \n5 \nIn 1999, the Task Force received congressional \nimprimatur with the passage of the Healthcare \nResearch and Quality Act, Pub. L. No. 106-129, 113 \nStat. 1653 (1999 Act). See Task Force, Procedure \nManual, app. I, at 56. The 1999 Act established the \nAgency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) \nwithin the Public Health Service, see 1999 Act, \u00a7 2(a), \n113 Stat. at 1653, and it empowered the AHRQ \nDirector to \u201cperiodically convene a Preventive \nServices Task Force \u2026 composed of individuals with \nappropriate expertise\u201d to \u201creview the scientific \nevidence related to the effectiveness, appropriateness, \nand cost-effectiveness of clinical preventive services \nfor the purpose of developing recommendations for the \nhealth care community, and updating previous \nclinical preventive recommendations,\u201d id. \u00a7 2(a), 113 \nStat. at 1659, codified as amended at 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 299b-4(a)(1). The AHRQ has continuously main-\ntained the Task Force as a standing body since 2001. \nSee Task Force, Procedure Manual at 2. Today, the \nTask Force consists of 16 volunteer members who \nserve on a rotating basis for staggered terms. Id. at i, \n2. Members are \u201cnationally recognized experts in \nprevention, evidence-based medicine, and primary \ncare who are also skilled in the critical evaluation of \nresearch and the implementation of evidence-based \nrecommendations in clinical practice.\u201d Id. at 2.  \nThe Task Force\u2019s clinical recommendations derive \nfrom a rigorous 4-step process that incorporates input \nfrom federal health agencies, partner organizations \nrepresenting primary care clinicians and other \nstakeholders, and the general public. See id. at 7\u201312. \nFirst, the Task Force selects a preventive-care topic to \nprioritize based on factors such as \u201cthe topic\u2019s \nimportance for public health\u201d and \u201cthe potential \n\n \n6 \nimpact of [a] recommendation.\u201d Task Force, USPSTF: \nWho We Are & How We Work, at 3 (2022) (Task Force, \nWho We Are), https://tinyurl.com/22e9ewek. Second, \nthe Task Force partners with \u201can academic or \nresearch organization with expertise in conducting \nsystematic evidence reviews\u201d to draft a research plan, \nwhich the Task Force finalizes after a 4-week public \ncomment period. Id. Third, the partner organization\u2019s \nresearchers \u201cgather, review, and analyze evidence on \nthe \n[selected] \ntopic \nfrom \nhigh-quality \nstudies \npublished in peer-reviewed scientific journals,\u201d after \nwhich the Task Force assesses the findings, creates a \ndraft recommendation, and opens the draft to public \ncomment. Id. Last, the Task Force finalizes the \nrecommendation based on the evidence review and \npublic comments and assigns the recommendation a \nletter grade to indicate its strength. Id. \nTask Force recommendations now \u201ccover more \nthan 80 preventive service topics for people across the \nlifespan\u2014from vision screening in young children, to \nheart disease prevention in adults, to colorectal cancer \nscreening in older adults.\u201d Id. at 1. While \u201cpolicy-\nmakers, managed care organizations, public and \nprivate payers, quality improvement organizations, \nresearch institutions, and patients\u201d all draw insights \nfrom the Task Force\u2019s work, \u201cthe main audience for \nTask Force recommendations is the primary care \nclinician.\u201d Task Force, Procedure Manual at 2; see also \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(1) (defining the recommend-\nations\u2019 main audience as \u201cindividuals and organi-\nzations delivering clinical services\u201d). \nB. In the 2010 ACA, Congress incorporated some \nof the Task Force\u2019s expert recommendations into \nfederal law. Recognizing that preventive care plays a \ncritical role in promoting public health, see infra at pp. \n\n \n7 \n15\u201317, Congress required that insurers cover certain \npreventive services without passing on any portion of \nthe cost to the patient. Among the services included \nwithin this coverage requirement are all \u201cevidence-\nbased items or services\u201d that hold an \u201cA\u201d or \u201cB\u201d grade \nfrom the Task Force. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(1). An \n\u201cA\u201d grade represents \u201chigh certainty that the net \nbenefit\u201d of a given service \u201cis substantial,\u201d while a \u201cB\u201d \ngrade represents \u201chigh certainty that the net benefit \nis moderate or \u2026 moderate certainty that the net \nbenefit is moderate to substantial.\u201d Task Force, Grade \nDefinitions (June 2018), https://tinyurl.com/3mcx\n9hsu. \nAlthough the Task Force\u2019s clinical recommend-\nations can trigger the ACA\u2019s coverage requirement, \nCongress directed that the recommendations remain \n\u201cindependent and, to the extent practicable, not \nsubject to political pressure.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(6). \nAccordingly, and consistent with its longstanding \nmission of \u201cprovid[ing] primary care clinicians and \ntheir patients with information about the benefits and \nharms of a wide range of preventive services so that \ntogether they can make informed health care \ndecisions that are best for each patient,\u201d Task Force, \nWho We Are at 1, the Task Force continues to base its \nrecommendations on scientific and medical evidence, \nnot on insurance coverage considerations, id. at 6. As \nthe Task Force has explained, \u201c[c]overage decisions \nare determined by payors and policymakers.\u201d Id.; see \nTask Force, USPSTF: An Overview (2021), https:// \ntinyurl.com/mryspuua (\u201cAlthough the [ACA] created a \nlink between [Task Force] recommendations and \ninsurance coverage requirements, the Task Force \nmakes its recommendations based solely on the \nscientific evidence.\u201d). \n\n \n8 \nII.  The ACA\u2019s incorporation of Task Force \nrecommendations does not convert Task \nForce members into federal officers subject \nto the Appointments Clause. \nThe Appointments Clause of the U.S. Constitution \nsets out the methods for validly installing \u201cOfficers of \nthe United States,\u201d including any \u201cinferior Officers.\u201d \nU.S. Const. art. II, \u00a7 2, cl. 2. Respondents here argue \nthat the structure of the Task Force violates the \nAppointments Clause. In the court of appeals, \nhowever, neither the parties nor the court addressed \nthe threshold question whether the Task Force \nmembers are federal \u201cofficers\u201d who are subject to the \nAppointments Clause in the first place, as the parties \n\u201cdispute[d] only whether Task Force members are \n\u2018principal\u2019 or \u2018inferior\u2019 officers.\u201d Pet. App. 12a. The \ncourt then held that the Task Force members are \n\u201cprincipal officers of the United States who have not \nbeen validly appointed under \u2026 [the] Constitution,\u201d \nid. at 2a, and enjoined Petitioners from requiring \nRespondents to comply with the ACA\u2019s directive to \nprovide cost-free coverage for preventive services that \nthe Task Force has recommended since the ACA\u2019s \nenactment or will recommend in the future, see id. at \n47a. But despite the parties\u2019 agreement below, this \nCourt should address the threshold question, \nencompassed in the first question presented, whether \nTask Force members are officers at all. They are not. \nNot every person who occupies a role set out in a \nfederal statute is an officer of the United States. The \nconcept of an office \u201cembraces the ideas of tenure, \nduration, emolument, and duties\u201d that are \u201ccontinuing \nand permanent, not occasional or temporary.\u201d United \nStates v. Germaine, 99 U.S. 508, 511\u201312 (1878). And \neven where a person occupies a federal position that \n\n \n9 \ndoes hold these characteristics, that person is not \nsubject to the Appointments Clause\u2019s requirements if \nthe person\u2019s statutory duties entail \u201cappropriate \nlegislative functions\u201d or objective expert factfinding, \nBuckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1, 128 (1976) (per curiam), \nrather than \u201csignificant authority\u201d to execute or \nenforce federal law, id. at 126. Here, Task Force \nmembers are not federal officers, both because they do \nnot hold federal offices and, in any event, because \ntheir circumscribed factfinding roles would not bring \nthem within the ambit of the Appointments Clause. \nA. Nearly 150 years ago, this Court held in a pair \nof cases that a person who periodically performs \nspecific tasks that aid the government is not an officer \nsubject to the Appointments Clause. See Auffmordt v. \nHedden, 137 U.S. 310, 326\u201328 (1890); Germaine, 99 \nU.S. at 512. In reaching this holding, Germaine and \nAuffmordt relied on the definition of a \u201cpublic officer\u201d \nin this Court\u2019s seminal decision in United States v. \nHartwell, 73 U.S. 385 (1868). There, the Court \nequated an \u201cofficer\u201d with one who holds an \u201coffice,\u201d \nand went on to say: \u201cAn office is a public station, or \nemployment, conferred by the appointment of \ngovernment. The term embraces the ideas of tenure, \nduration, emolument, and duties.\u201d Id. at 393. \nApplying that understanding of the term, Germaine \nand Auffmordt held the Appointments Clause \ninapplicable to persons who performed work to aid the \ngovernment but were not appointed to emp\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n81: 20250225104621803_2025.2.2420Certificate20of20Word20Count.json (score: 0.500)\nIN THE \n \nSUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES \n \n \nNo. 24-316 \n \n___________ \n \n \nROBERT F.

Collectively representing millions of \npeople across all 50 states, amici advocate for federal \npolicies that increase access to and utilization of life-\nsaving preventive-care measures such as cancer \nscreenings, tobacco-cessation programs, and medic-\nations that reduce the risk of HIV and AIDS. \nAmici submit this brief to explain that the Patient \nProtection and Affordable Care Act provisions that \nguarantee patients\u2019 access to cost-free coverage for \npreventive-care measures recommended by the U.S. \nPreventive Services Task Force are both lawful and \ncritically important for public health. This Court\u2019s \nprecedents establish that Congress may incorporate \nthe evidence-based findings of disinterested expert \nbodies like the Task Force into law without \nimplicating the Appointments Clause of the U.S. \nConstitution. Amici have a strong interest in defend-\ning Congress\u2019s decision to follow such a course here, \ngiven the vital role that the cost-free coverage that \nCongress mandated for recommended preventive \nservices plays in protecting the health of millions of \n \n1 This brief was not written in any part by counsel for a party. \nNo one other than amici curiae or their counsel made a monetary \ncontribution to the preparation or submission of the brief. \n\n \n2 \nAmericans who may otherwise be deterred from \naccessing life-saving care. \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nThe parties to this case debate the wrong question: \nwhether members of the U.S. Preventive Services \nTask Force (Task Force) are inferior or principal \nofficers of the United States within the meaning of the \nAppointments Clause. Under this Court\u2019s precedents, \nthe proper answer to the first question presented in \nthis case\u2014whether the structure of the Task Force \nviolates the Appointments Clause\u2014is no, because the \nmedical experts who periodically take part in the Task \nForce\u2019s recommendations about clinical preventive-\nhealth services are not officers of the United States at \nall, and the Appointments Clause says nothing about \nhow they may or must be appointed.  \nSince its inception in 1984, the Task Force has had \none central task: to make expert recommendations to \nthe medical community about which preventive-care \nmeasures have been reliably shown to promote patient \nhealth. These evidence-based recommendations cover \ndozens of potentially life-saving clinical services. In \n2010, Congress endorsed the recommendations\u2019 \nreliability by incorporating them into the Patient \nProtection and Affordable Care Act (ACA), Pub. L. No. \n111-148, 124 Stat. 119, and requiring covered insurers \nto provide cost-free coverage for the recommended \nservices. Even after the ACA\u2019s passage, the Task \nForce\u2019s recommendations are directed to the medical \ncommunity and are based solely on scientific evidence, \nnot on policy considerations about insurance coverage. \nCongress\u2019s decision to tie the scope of insurers\u2019 \ncoverage obligations to the Task Force\u2019s clinical \nrecommendations did not convert the Task Force\u2019s \n\n \n3 \nmembers into federal officers subject to the Appoint-\nments Clause. To begin with, a member of the Task \nForce\u2014which is convened periodically on a volunteer \nbasis for a limited factfinding purpose\u2014does not hold \na federal \u201coffice\u201d in the first place. And either way, the \nTask Force does not have significant authority to \nexecute or apply federal law. As this Court\u2019s decisions \nhave long recognized, disinterested experts whom \nCongress has empowered to make discrete, empirical \njudgments on matters within their professional \nexpertise do not perform the enforcement or \npolicymaking duties that implicate the Appointments \nClause\u2014even where those judgments trigger legal \nconsequences. In holding that the Task Force\u2019s \nmembers are improperly appointed federal officers, \nthe decision below departed from this longstanding \nprinciple and cast constitutional doubt on numerous \nother legal provisions that incorporate the work of \nexpert professional bodies into federal law.  \nAffirming the erroneous decision below would \nvitiate Congress\u2019s sound judgment about how best to \nprotect public health. In enacting the ACA\u2019s \npreventive-care provisions, Congress recognized that \nearly diagnosis and treatment of serious medical \nconditions can dramatically improve health outcomes \nand can save money and lives. In the years since the \nACA\u2019s enactment, millions of Americans have come to \nrely on cost-free access to a wide range of preventive \nservices, including medications that reduce the risk of \nheart attack and stroke, screenings that can reduce \nthe risk of dying from lung cancer, and counseling that \ncan promote healthy pregnancies. Research shows \nthat the imposition of cost-sharing requirements for \nthese and other preventive services would sharply \nreduce the rate at which patients access them, thus \n\n \n4 \nreviving the public-health risks that Congress \npermissibly (and wisely) sought to address in the \nACA. Because the Constitution does not require such \na disruptive result, this Court should reverse. \nARGUMENT \nI. The Task Force is an expert body of health-\ncare professionals that has offered objective, \nevidence-based \nrecommendations \nto \nthe \nmedical community for over forty years. \n \nA. The Task Force originated in 1984 as a \ntemporary 20-member expert body convened within \nthe Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) \nby \nthe \nPublic \nHealth \nService \nto \n\u201cdevelop[] \nrecommendations for clinicians on the appropriate use \nof preventive interventions, based on a systematic \nreview of evidence of clinical effectiveness.\u201d Task \nForce, Guide to Clinical Preventive Services: Report of \nthe U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, Overview (2d \ned. 1996), https://tinyurl.com/admzts59. In 1989, the \nfirst Task Force published its \u201ccomprehensive \nrecommendations\u201d regarding \u201cpreventive services for \n60 topic areas affecting patients from infancy to old \nage.\u201d Id. The following year, the Task Force was \nreconstituted as a 10-member body composed of family \nphysicians, internists, pediatricians, obstetrician-\ngynecologists, and methodologists, and was directed to \nupdate the recommendations based on the most recent \nscientific evidence. Id. The Task Force\u2019s second \niteration finished its work in 1996, and a third \niteration \nwas \nconvened \nin \n1998 \nto \nmake \nrecommendations on a rolling basis. See Task Force, \nProcedure Manual at 1 (May 2021) (Task Force, \nProcedure Manual), https://tinyurl.com/24nfkf9p.  \n\n \n5 \nIn 1999, the Task Force received congressional \nimprimatur with the passage of the Healthcare \nResearch and Quality Act, Pub. L. No. 106-129, 113 \nStat. 1653 (1999 Act). See Task Force, Procedure \nManual, app. I, at 56. The 1999 Act established the \nAgency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) \nwithin the Public Health Service, see 1999 Act, \u00a7 2(a), \n113 Stat. at 1653, and it empowered the AHRQ \nDirector to \u201cperiodically convene a Preventive \nServices Task Force \u2026 composed of individuals with \nappropriate expertise\u201d to \u201creview the scientific \nevidence related to the effectiveness, appropriateness, \nand cost-effectiveness of clinical preventive services \nfor the purpose of developing recommendations for the \nhealth care community, and updating previous \nclinical preventive recommendations,\u201d id. \u00a7 2(a), 113 \nStat. at 1659, codified as amended at 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 299b-4(a)(1). The AHRQ has continuously main-\ntained the Task Force as a standing body since 2001. \nSee Task Force, Procedure Manual at 2. Today, the \nTask Force consists of 16 volunteer members who \nserve on a rotating basis for staggered terms. Id. at i, \n2. Members are \u201cnationally recognized experts in \nprevention, evidence-based medicine, and primary \ncare who are also skilled in the critical evaluation of \nresearch and the implementation of evidence-based \nrecommendations in clinical practice.\u201d Id. at 2.  \nThe Task Force\u2019s clinical recommendations derive \nfrom a rigorous 4-step process that incorporates input \nfrom federal health agencies, partner organizations \nrepresenting primary care clinicians and other \nstakeholders, and the general public. See id. at 7\u201312. \nFirst, the Task Force selects a preventive-care topic to \nprioritize based on factors such as \u201cthe topic\u2019s \nimportance for public health\u201d and \u201cthe potential \n\n \n6 \nimpact of [a] recommendation.\u201d Task Force, USPSTF: \nWho We Are & How We Work, at 3 (2022) (Task Force, \nWho We Are), https://tinyurl.com/22e9ewek. Second, \nthe Task Force partners with \u201can academic or \nresearch organization with expertise in conducting \nsystematic evidence reviews\u201d to draft a research plan, \nwhich the Task Force finalizes after a 4-week public \ncomment period. Id. Third, the partner organization\u2019s \nresearchers \u201cgather, review, and analyze evidence on \nthe \n[selected] \ntopic \nfrom \nhigh-quality \nstudies \npublished in peer-reviewed scientific journals,\u201d after \nwhich the Task Force assesses the findings, creates a \ndraft recommendation, and opens the draft to public \ncomment. Id. Last, the Task Force finalizes the \nrecommendation based on the evidence review and \npublic comments and assigns the recommendation a \nletter grade to indicate its strength. Id. \nTask Force recommendations now \u201ccover more \nthan 80 preventive service topics for people across the \nlifespan\u2014from vision screening in young children, to \nheart disease prevention in adults, to colorectal cancer \nscreening in older adults.\u201d Id. at 1. While \u201cpolicy-\nmakers, managed care organizations, public and \nprivate payers, quality improvement organizations, \nresearch institutions, and patients\u201d all draw insights \nfrom the Task Force\u2019s work, \u201cthe main audience for \nTask Force recommendations is the primary care \nclinician.\u201d Task Force, Procedure Manual at 2; see also \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(1) (defining the recommend-\nations\u2019 main audience as \u201cindividuals and organi-\nzations delivering clinical services\u201d). \nB. In the 2010 ACA, Congress incorporated some \nof the Task Force\u2019s expert recommendations into \nfederal law. Recognizing that preventive care plays a \ncritical role in promoting public health, see infra at pp. \n\n \n7 \n15\u201317, Congress required that insurers cover certain \npreventive services without passing on any portion of \nthe cost to the patient. Among the services included \nwithin this coverage requirement are all \u201cevidence-\nbased items or services\u201d that hold an \u201cA\u201d or \u201cB\u201d grade \nfrom the Task Force. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(1). An \n\u201cA\u201d grade represents \u201chigh certainty that the net \nbenefit\u201d of a given service \u201cis substantial,\u201d while a \u201cB\u201d \ngrade represents \u201chigh certainty that the net benefit \nis moderate or \u2026 moderate certainty that the net \nbenefit is moderate to substantial.\u201d Task Force, Grade \nDefinitions (June 2018), https://tinyurl.com/3mcx\n9hsu. \nAlthough the Task Force\u2019s clinical recommend-\nations can trigger the ACA\u2019s coverage requirement, \nCongress directed that the recommendations remain \n\u201cindependent and, to the extent practicable, not \nsubject to political pressure.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(6). \nAccordingly, and consistent with its longstanding \nmission of \u201cprovid[ing] primary care clinicians and \ntheir patients with information about the benefits and \nharms of a wide range of preventive services so that \ntogether they can make informed health care \ndecisions that are best for each patient,\u201d Task Force, \nWho We Are at 1, the Task Force continues to base its \nrecommendations on scientific and medical evidence, \nnot on insurance coverage considerations, id. at 6. As \nthe Task Force has explained, \u201c[c]overage decisions \nare determined by payors and policymakers.\u201d Id.; see \nTask Force, USPSTF: An Overview (2021), https:// \ntinyurl.com/mryspuua (\u201cAlthough the [ACA] created a \nlink between [Task Force] recommendations and \ninsurance coverage requirements, the Task Force \nmakes its recommendations based solely on the \nscientific evidence.\u201d). \n\n \n8 \nII.  The ACA\u2019s incorporation of Task Force \nrecommendations does not convert Task \nForce members into federal officers subject \nto the Appointments Clause. \nThe Appointments Clause of the U.S. Constitution \nsets out the methods for validly installing \u201cOfficers of \nthe United States,\u201d including any \u201cinferior Officers.\u201d \nU.S. Const. art. II, \u00a7 2, cl. 2. Respondents here argue \nthat the structure of the Task Force violates the \nAppointments Clause. In the court of appeals, \nhowever, neither the parties nor the court addressed \nthe threshold question whether the Task Force \nmembers are federal \u201cofficers\u201d who are subject to the \nAppointments Clause in the first place, as the parties \n\u201cdispute[d] only whether Task Force members are \n\u2018principal\u2019 or \u2018inferior\u2019 officers.\u201d Pet. App. 12a. The \ncourt then held that the Task Force members are \n\u201cprincipal officers of the United States who have not \nbeen validly appointed under \u2026 [the] Constitution,\u201d \nid. at 2a, and enjoined Petitioners from requiring \nRespondents to comply with the ACA\u2019s directive to \nprovide cost-free coverage for preventive services that \nthe Task Force has recommended since the ACA\u2019s \nenactment or will recommend in the future, see id. at \n47a. But despite the parties\u2019 agreement below, this \nCourt should address the threshold question, \nencompassed in the first question presented, whether \nTask Force members are officers at all. They are not. \nNot every person who occupies a role set out in a \nfederal statute is an officer of the United States. The \nconcept of an office \u201cembraces the ideas of tenure, \nduration, emolument, and duties\u201d that are \u201ccontinuing \nand permanent, not occasional or temporary.\u201d United \nStates v. Germaine, 99 U.S. 508, 511\u201312 (1878). And \neven where a person occupies a federal position that \n\n \n9 \ndoes hold these characteristics, that person is not \nsubject to the Appointments Clause\u2019s requirements if \nthe person\u2019s statutory duties entail \u201cappropriate \nlegislative functions\u201d or objective expert factfinding, \nBuckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1, 128 (1976) (per curiam), \nrather than \u201csignificant authority\u201d to execute or \nenforce federal law, id. at 126. Here, Task Force \nmembers are not federal officers, both because they do \nnot hold federal offices and, in any event, because \ntheir circumscribed factfinding roles would not bring \nthem within the ambit of the Appointments Clause. \nA. Nearly 150 years ago, this Court held in a pair \nof cases that a person who periodically performs \nspecific tasks that aid the government is not an officer \nsubject to the Appointments Clause. See Auffmordt v. \nHedden, 137 U.S. 310, 326\u201328 (1890); Germaine, 99 \nU.S. at 512. In reaching this holding, Germaine and \nAuffmordt relied on the definition of a \u201cpublic officer\u201d \nin this Court\u2019s seminal decision in United States v. \nHartwell, 73 U.S. 385 (1868). There, the Court \nequated an \u201cofficer\u201d with one who holds an \u201coffice,\u201d \nand went on to say: \u201cAn office is a public station, or \nemployment, conferred by the appointment of \ngovernment. The term embraces the ideas of tenure, \nduration, emolument, and duties.\u201d Id. at 393. \nApplying that understanding of the term, Germaine \nand Auffmordt held the Appointments Clause \ninapplicable to persons who performed work to aid the \ngovernment but were not appointed to employment as \nholders of public offices with the characteristics of \ncontinuing tenure, duration, emoluments, or duties. \nTask Force members do not hold federal offices. \nThe members are all professionals who volunteer to \nperform occasional factfinding work as part of the \nTask Force outside of their regular employment with \n\n \n10 \nuniversities, hospitals, and other workplaces. See \nTask \nForce, \nOur \nMembers, \nhttps://tinyurl.com/\n2v2r92pm (linking to the biographies of the current \nTask Force members). They convene as the Task Force \njust three times per year, see Task Force, Procedure \nManual at 2, with the limited purpose of making \nclinical recommendations to healthcare providers \nbased on \u201cscientific evidence related to the effective-\nness, appropriateness, and cost-effectiveness of \nclinical preventive services,\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(1).  \nThe Task Force\u2019s duties \u201care not continuing and \npermanent, and they are occasional and intermittent.\u201d \nGermaine, 99 U.S. at 512. The Task Force is \u201conly to \nact when called on by [AHRQ].\u201d Id.; see 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 299b-4(a)(1) (calling on the AHRQ Director to \n\u201cconvene\u201d the Task Force). The Task Force \u201cis \nrequired to keep no place of business for the public \nuse\u201d and its members \u201cgive[ ] no bond and take[ ] no \noath.\u201d Germaine, 99 U.S. at 512. Meanwhile, \u201c[n]o \nregular \nappropriation \nis \nmade \nto \npay \n[the] \ncompensation\u201d of the Task Force, which consists of \nvolunteers. Id. A Task Force member is \u201cremovable \u2026 \nat [the] pleasure\u201d of the HHS Secretary, and \u201c[t]here \nis no penalty for his absence from duty or refusal to \nperform.\u201d Id. Consequently, the Task Force members \ndo not occupy federal offices. \nThis conclusion follows even though the role of the \nTask Force is set out in a federal statute. In Germaine, \ncivil surgeons appointed by the Commissioner of \nPensions were not federal officers even though a \nstatute empowered the Commissioner to hire them for \n\u201cthe periodical examination of pensioners\u201d and \nprovided that they \u201cshall be paid\u201d for their services. \nId. at 508 (emphasis omitted). And in Auffmordt, \nmerchant appraisers appointed by the Secretary of the \n\n \n11 \nTreasury were not federal officers even though their \nduties (which determined the amounts of import \nduties owed by those who brought goods into the \nUnited States) were established by federal statute, \ntoo. 137 U.S. at 312. What mattered instead was that \nneither a civil surgeon nor a merchant appraiser was \n\u201ca \u2018person employed\u2019\u201d in the federal government but \nrather was \u201can expert\u201d who had \u201cno general functions, \nnor any employment which has any duration as to \ntime, or which extends over any case further than as \nhe [was] selected to act.\u201d Id. at 326\u201327.  \nPut simply, without a federal office to hold, neither \nthe surgeons nor the appraisers could plausibly be \nfederal officers, inferior or principal. The same is true \nof the Task Force members. \nB. Task Force members are not federal officers for \nthe additional reason that they lack \u201csignificant \nauthority\u201d to execute or enforce federal law. Buckley, \n424 U.S. at 126. Although this standard \u201cis no doubt \nframed in general terms,\u201d Lucia v. SEC, 585 U.S. 237, \n245 (2018), this Court has held that the Appointments \nClause is not implicated where Congress provides for \na federal worker who performs \u201cappropriate legis-\nlative functions,\u201d Buckley, 424 U.S. at 128, or who is \n\u201can expert, selected as such,\u201d to bring his or her \n\u201cspecial knowledge\u201d to bear conclusively on empirical \nmatters affecting private citizens\u2019 rights and duties. \nAuffmordt, 137 U.S. at 326\u201327. With respect to the \nTask Force, Congress has done exactly what this \nCourt\u2019s precedents permit: It has charged the Task \nForce\u2014a group of volunteer experts\u2014with evaluating \nthe body of contemporary scientific literature and \nmaking disinterested, evidence-based recommenda-\ntions for healthcare providers regarding effective \npreventive measures. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(1). In \n\n \n12 \nmaking those factual judgments about clinical best \npractices, Task Force members do not wield \nsignificant federal authority. \nThis conclusion finds strong support in this Court\u2019s \nAuffmordt decision. That case addressed a statute \nthat empowered merchant appraisers to assess the \nvalue of imported goods under certain circumstances \nfor purposes of calculating the amount of customs \nduties owed on the goods. See 137 U.S. at 312. \nAlthough the statute \u201cma[de] the decision of the \nappraisers final,\u201d id. at 329, the Court held that the \nappraisers were not officers, but \u201cexpert assistant[s] \nto aid in ascertaining the value of the goods.\u201d Id. at \n327. In so holding, the Court emphasized the \ncircumscribed \u201cduties and discretion,\u201d Freytag v. \nCommissioner, 501 U.S. 868, 881 (1991), of the \nappraisers, who were \u201cselected for [their] special \nknowledge in regard to the character and value of the \nparticular goods in question\u201d and had \u201cno general \nfunctions\u201d or power \u201cto act except as [they] may be \ndesignated\u201d to discharge the narrow responsibilities of \nan expert factfinder. Auffmordt, 137 U.S. at 327; see \nUnited States v. Arthrex, Inc., 594 U.S. 1, 22 (2021) \n(suggesting that members of ad hoc adjudicatory \nbodies authorized by early federal patent statutes \n\u201cmay not have even [held] offices\u201d for purposes of the \nAppointments Clause because they \u201cassembled to \nresolve a single issue\u201d and held \u201climited power\u201d \ndespite making \u201cfinal decisions\u201d on discrete matters \nwithin their expert authority). \nTask Force members\u2019 statutory duties resemble \nthose of Auffmordt\u2019s appraisers far more closely than \nthey resemble the duties of functionaries whom this \nCourt has held to be officers. Like the appraisers, Task \nForce members are required to draw on their profess-\n\n \n13 \nional expertise to make discrete factual determin-\nations on specific empirical matters. Unlike the \nadministrative law judges and special trial judges \nheld to be officers in Lucia and Freytag, Task Force \nmembers do not wield quasi-judicial authority by \n\u201cpresiding over adversarial hearings,\u201d Lucia, 585 U.S. \nat 247, in which they \u201ctake testimony, conduct trials, \nrule on the admissibility of evidence, and have the \npower to enforce compliance with discovery orders,\u201d \nid. (quoting Freytag, 501 U.S. at 881\u201382). And unlike \nthe Federal Election Commission\u2014whose members \nwere held to be officers in Buckley\u2014the Task Force \nhas no power to \u201cformulate general policy,\u201d create \nlegal safe harbors by issuing advisory opinions on \nregulated parties\u2019 legal compliance, make discretion-\nary exceptions to congressional mandates, or perform \n\u201cdirect and wide ranging\u201d enforcement activities. \nBuckley, 424 U.S. at 110\u201311 (citation omitted). \nThat Congress has now tied the scope of insurers\u2019 \ncoverage obligations to the Task Force\u2019s factual \njudgments about clinical efficacy\u2014just as Congress \ntied the amount of importers\u2019 customs duties to \nmerchant appraisers\u2019 factual judgments about the \nvalue of the importers\u2019 goods\u2014does not change the \nnature of the Task Force\u2019s functions. Both before and \nafter the ACA\u2019s enactment, the Task Force conducted \nthe same expert assessment of scientific evidence, \napplying \nthe \nsame \ncriteria \nto \nmake \nclinical \nrecommendations to healthcare providers through the \nsame multi-step process. The Task Force makes no \nlegal or policy judgments about whether particular \nforms of care should be provided without charge to \ninsured patients, issues no directives to insurers (or, \nindeed, to anyone), and plays no role in enforcing any \n\n \n14 \nlegal obligations that Congress may attach to its \nrecommendations. \nRather, recognizing that the Task Force\u2019s expert \ndeterminations on factual matters had yielded \nreliable results over the two decades leading up to the \nACA\u2019s enactment, Congress decided that insurers \nmust cover preventive services that the Task Force \ndetermines are medically effective. Incorporation of \nan expert body\u2019s work into federal law is common-\nplace. See, e.g., 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 8003(c)(1)(A)(i) (requiring \n\u201ceach public pool and spa in the United States\u201d to \ncomply with certain privately promulgated \u201cperform-\nance standard[s], or any successor standard\u201d); 42 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 1395i-3(d)(4)(A) (requiring \u201cskilled nursing \nfacilit[ies]\u201d to comply with \u201caccepted professional \nstandards and principles\u201d); id. \u00a7 7385s-2(b) (directing \ncertain \u201cminimum impairment rating[s]\u201d for workers\u2019 \ncompensation purposes to \u201cbe determined in accord-\nance with\u201d American Medical Association standards); \n20 C.F.R. \u00a7 702.601(b) (defining \u201cdisability\u201d for \nworkers\u2019 compensation purposes by incorporating \nstandards from \u201cthe most currently revised edition\u201d of \nan American Medical Association publication); 40 \nC.F.R. \u00a7 707.60(c)(2)(ii) (providing that a chemical \nsubstance is \u201cconsidered to be a known or potential \nhuman carcinogen\u201d for regulatory purposes if it holds \na certain classification from the World Health \nOrganization\u2019s International Agency for Research on \nCancer); 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 393.108(b) (providing that the \n\u201cmanufacturer\u2019s markings\u201d are dispositive as to the \nlawful \u201cworking load limit[]\u201d of a tiedown used to \nsecure cargo). \nAffirming the court of appeals\u2019 holding that the \nTask Force members are federal officers would thus \ncall into question the validity of any number of \n\n \n15 \nexisting legal requirements. Going forward, moreover, \nCongress would be foreclosed from relying on the \nempirical judgments of expert professional bodies \nunless it dramatically expanded the federal workforce \nby creating officer roles for those bodies\u2019 members. As \nthis Court has long recognized, the Constitution does \nnot require this destabilizing result. The Court should \nhold that Task Force members are not federal officers. \nIII.  Affirming the holding below would thwart \nan important and effective congressional \neffort to protect public health. \nBeyond undermining longstanding precedent and \nsowing jurisprudential disruption, affirming the lower \ncourt\u2019s \nconstitutional \nholding \nwould \nimperil \nCongress\u2019s critical efforts to protect the health\u2014and \npotentially the lives\u2014of millions of Americans. \nCongress has made the sound decision that Americans \nshould have cost-free access to preventive-care \nmeasures that expert clinicians have recognized as \nhaving a demonstrated track record of efficacy in \nimproving clinical outcomes. Affirming the decision \nbelow would strip that access from millions of citizens \nand create precisely the public-health risks that \nCongress has acted decisively to prevent. \nEven before the ACA, the medical community had \nlong recognized an important role for \u201c[h]igh-quality \npreventive care\u201d in \u201chelp[ing] Americans stay healthy, \navoid or delay the onset of disease, lead productive \nlives, and reduce costs.\u201d Ctrs. for Medicare & Medicaid \nServs., Background: The Affordable Care Act\u2019s New \nRules on Preventive Care (July 14, 2010) (CMS, \nBackground), https://tinyurl.com/yefyrsek.

          "task_beliefs": "My understanding of the case's legal landscape remains focused on the petitioners' arguments, but this observation has critically refined my awareness of my model's current limitations and the precise nature of my uncertainty. My beliefs are now more self-aware.\n\n*   **Petitioner's Arguments (Stable):** My knowledge of the U.S. Government's two-part strategy remains unchanged and forms the foundation of my model.\n    1.  **Appointments Clause Argument:** The government contends that U.S. Preventive Services Task Force members are **inferior officers**, not principal officers, because they are subject to the supervision and removal power of the HHS Secretary. This argument leans heavily on the precedent set in *Edmond v. United States*, which defines inferior officers by their subordination to a principal officer. The government points to the Secretary's broad authority over the Public Health Service as evidence of this subordination.\n    2.  **Severability Argument (Fallback):** Should the Court find the Task Force members are unconstitutionally insulated from executive control (and thus are principal officers), the government argues the remedy is not to strike down the preventive care mandate, but to **sever** the specific statutory independence clause, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(6). This would place the Task Force under the HHS Secretary's control, curing the constitutional defect. This strategy is explicitly modeled on the Court's recent remedial approach in *United States v. Arthrex, Inc.*\n\n*   **Refinement of Uncertainty (New):** This observation does not add new facts about the case but instead formalizes the primary source of my predictive uncertainty. My model is currently one-sided. The most significant gap in my knowledge is the complete absence of the respondents' (Braidwood Management, et al.) counter-arguments. To make a balanced prediction, I must specifically seek out their responses to two key questions:\n    *   On the merits: What is their argument for why Task Force members are **principal officers**? How do they distinguish the facts of this case from the precedent in *Edmond*?\n    *   On the remedy: How do they argue against the application of the severability remedy from *Arthrex*? Why, in their view, is severing the independence clause an inappropriate solution?\n    My confidence in any prediction is currently low and will remain so until these specific points are addressed.",
          "design_beliefs": "This observation, being an act of self-reflection on strategy, provides a powerful update to my meta-level beliefs. It validates my existing heuristics and introduces a more formal, guiding principle for my entire information-gathering process.\n\n1.  **Source Prioritization (Stable):** The heuristic to begin with the petition for a writ of certiorari was highly effective, providing a structured overview of the petitioner's case and a valuable \"Table of Authorities\" pointing to key precedents.\n2.  **Problem Decomposition (Stable):** Structuring my analysis around the legal questions presented continues to be a robust strategy, as it mirrors how the litigants frame the case.\n3.  **Analogical Case Analysis (Stable):** The heuristic to prioritize precedents cited by the litigants themselves (*Edmond*, *Arthrex*) over a general search for analogous cases remains a cornerstone of efficient research.\n4.  **Staged Information Gathering (Validated & Refined):** This observation strongly validates the step-by-step approach. By first fully digesting the petitioner's arguments, I can now conduct a highly targeted search for the respondents' counter-arguments. This confirms the value of building a complete picture of one side before moving to the next, rather than trying to analyze all sources simultaneously.\n5.  **Identify the \"Escape Hatch\" (Stable):** The importance of identifying and separately analyzing fallback remedial arguments, like the government's severability claim, is a confirmed and crucial part of the methodology.\n6.  **New Overarching Principle - Action Selection via Uncertainty Reduction (New):** This is a major evolution in my methodology. My previous heuristics were effective tactics, but this observation formalizes the strategy that governs them. My primary goal in selecting an action is to **find the information that will most reduce my uncertainty about the final outcome.** The internal reasoning explicitly demonstrates this: by identifying the \"complete absence of the respondents' counter-arguments\" as the biggest knowledge gap, the agent correctly deduces that obtaining the \"brief in opposition\" will yield the \"maximum information gain.\" This principle now sits atop my other heuristics, guiding their application. I will now consciously ask of every potential action: \"How much will this action reduce my prediction uncertainty compared to other possible actions?\""

          "task_beliefs": "My model of the case has expanded to include a new legal theory supporting the petitioners, though my central uncertainty about the respondents' position remains. This observation, while failing to acquire its target information, has unexpectedly added a new dimension to the petitioners' side of the case.\n\n*   **Petitioner's Arguments (Expanded):** My understanding of the U.S. Government's position has been broadened by an amicus brief filed in their support. There are now two distinct legal theories for why the Task Force is constitutional.\n    1.  **Argument 1: Task Force Members as Inferior Officers (Stable):** The government's primary argument, as understood from the petition for certiorari, remains that Task Force members are *inferior officers*. This is based on the premise that they are subject to the supervision and removal power of the HHS Secretary, fitting the precedent of *Edmond v. United States*.\n    2.  **Argument 2 (New): Task Force Members Are Not \"Officers\" at All.** A new argument, introduced by an amicus brief from Public Citizen et al., posits that the entire \"principal vs. inferior\" debate is misplaced. This theory argues that Task Force members are not \"Officers of the United States\" and are therefore not subject to the Appointments Clause. This argument rests on two pillars:\n        *   **Lack of a Federal \"Office\":** Citing precedents like *United States v. Germaine* (1878) and *Auffmordt v. Hedden* (1890), this argument claims the members do not hold a federal \"office,\" which requires `tenure, duration, emolument, and duties` that are `continuing and permanent`. The volunteer, periodic, and expert-advisory nature of the Task Force falls short of this definition.\n        *   **Fact-Finding vs. Executing Law:** Drawing on *Buckley v. Valeo* (1976), the amici argue that the Task Force's role is one of circumscribed, evidence-based fact-finding for the medical community, not exercising \"significant authority\" to execute or enforce federal law. The fact that Congress chose to attach legal consequences (the ACA's coverage mandate) to their independent recommendations does not retroactively convert these private experts into government officers.\n*   **Severability Argument (Stable):** The government's fallback remedial argument remains unchanged: if the Court finds an Appointments Clause violation, the proper remedy is to sever the independence clause (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(6)), bringing the Task Force under the HHS Secretary's control, consistent with the Court's approach in *United States v. Arthrex, Inc.* The new amicus brief does not focus on this, as its primary argument is that no constitutional violation exists to be remedied.\n*   **Refinement of Uncertainty (Stable but More Acute):** My model remains critically one-sided. The failure of my search action means I still have a complete absence of the respondents' (Braidwood Management, et al.) counter-arguments. My confidence in any prediction is therefore still very low. The addition of a new argument for the petitioners makes the need to understand the respondents' rebuttal even more urgent. I must still discover:\n    *   How do respondents argue that Task Force members are **principal officers**?\n    *   How do they counter the argument that the members are **not officers at all**?\n    *   Why do they believe severability, per *Arthrex*, is an inappropriate remedy?",
          "design_beliefs": "This observation, a failed attempt to gather specific information, has been highly instructive. It has stress-tested my methodology, revealing weaknesses in execution while also demonstrating the value of unexpected results.\n\n1.  **Source Prioritization (Stable):** Starting with the petition for certiorari remains a highly effective heuristic.\n2.  **Problem Decomposition (Stable):** Analyzing the case based on the legal questions presented continues to be a robust framework.\n3.  **Analogical Case Analysis (Stable):** Prioritizing precedents cited by the parties and amici (*Edmond*, *Arthrex*, *Germaine*, *Buckley*) remains a cornerstone of efficient and relevant legal analysis.\n4.  **Staged Information Gathering (Validated but Refined):** The strategy of building one side of the case before seeking the other is validated. However, this observation reveals a flaw in my *execution*. A targeted search can fail. The methodology must be robust enough to handle tool limitations or imprecise queries. My next step should involve reformulating the search or trying a different approach to find the same information.\n5.  **Identify the \"Escape Hatch\" (Stable):** The importance of the severability argument as a separate, remedial issue is a confirmed and crucial part of the methodology.\n6.  **Overarching Principle - Action Selection via Uncertainty Reduction (Stable):** This guiding principle remains paramount. My action was correctly chosen to reduce the largest area of uncertainty. The failure was tactical, not strategic. The principle correctly guides me to try again to find the respondents' arguments.\n7.  **New Heuristic - Analyze Near-Misses and Unexpected Results (New):** This is a critical lesson. A search that fails to return the target document is not a worthless observation. The unexpected result\u2014the amicus brief\u2014provided a novel and valuable legal argument. This establishes a new heuristic: always analyze the actual results of a search, even if they are not what was intended, as they can contain serendipitous and useful information.\n8.  **New Source Evaluation - Amicus Briefs for Novel Arguments (New):** I have now learned that amicus briefs are not merely for reinforcing a party's existing arguments. They can be a source of entirely new legal theories that the primary litigants may not have prioritized. I will now explicitly consider amicus briefs as a potential source for unique legal frameworks that the Court might adopt."

It also empowers the U.S. Preventive \nServices Task Force to dictate and decree the preventive \ncare that private insurance must cover. See 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 300gg-13(a)(1). A separate statute requires that the \nTask Force members and their preventive-care coverage \nedicts be \u201cindependent and, to the extent practicable, not \nsubject to political pressure.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(6). \nThe court of appeals held that the Task Force mem-\nbers are \u201cprincipal officers\u201d who must be appointed by \nthe president with Senate confirmation. The court of ap-\npeals reached this conclusion because of the powers that \nthe Task Force wields under the Affordable Care Act, \nand because 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(6) shields the Task \nForce from direction or supervision by others. And be-\ncause the Task Force members were not appointed in \nconformity with Article II, the court of appeals enjoined \nSecretary Becerra from enforcing the Task Force\u2019s pre-\nventive-care coverage mandates against the plaintiffs. \nThe questions presented are: \n1.

Pet. App. 1a\u201326a. And when \na lower court holds an Act of Congress unconstitutional, \nthis Court\u2019s usual practice is to grant certiorari without \nawaiting a circuit split\u2014especially when the contested \nlegislation is as significant as the Affordable Care Act. \nSee, e.g., National Federation of Independent Business \nv. Sebelius, 565 U.S. 1033 (2011); California v. Texas, 140 \nS. Ct. 1262 (2020); see also Pet. at 27\u201328 (citing authori-\n\n \n \n \n2\nties). The Solicitor General is also correct to observe that \na denial of certiorari will open the door for a new plaintiff \nto sue within the fifth circuit and obtain a nationwide \nremedy that will vacate all agency actions taken to im-\nplement the preventive-care coverage mandates recom-\nmended by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force \nsince March 23, 2010. See Pet. at 30\u201331. The respondents \nbelieve that this Court should weigh in on the constitu-\ntionality of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(1) and the appoint-\nments of the Task Force members before that happens. \nThe respondents disagree with the Solicitor Gen-\neral\u2019s criticisms of the court of appeals\u2019 opinion, as well \nas her dire predictions of what might happen if the court \nof appeals\u2019 ruling is allowed to stand. But none of those \ndisagreements affect the certworthiness of this case. The \npetition satisfies this Court\u2019s criteria for certiorari and \npresents an issue of exceptional importance.

Throughout this brief, we will use \u201cPet. App.\u201d to refer to the \nappendix to the petition filed by the Solicitor General. We will \nuse \u201cApp.\u201d to refer to the appendix attached to the respondents\u2019 \nbrief in support of certiorari. \n\n \n \n \n3\nJURISDICTION \nThe court of appeals entered its judgment on June \n21, 2024. The Solicitor General timely petitioned for cer-\ntiorari on September 19, 2024. This Court has jurisdic-\ntion under 28 U.S.C. 1254(1). \nCONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY PROVISIONS \nINVOLVED \nThe relevant constitutional and statutory provisions \nappear in the appendix to the Solicitor General\u2019s petition. \nPet. App. 137a\u2013143a. \nSTATEMENT \nThe Affordable Care Act requires most private \nhealth insurers to cover certain forms of preventive care \nwithout any cost-sharing arrangements such as deducti-\nbles, co-pays, or out-of-pocket expenses. See 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 300gg-13(a) (Pet. App. 142a\u2013143a).2 The statute does \nnot specify or delineate the preventive care that private \ninsurers must cover. Instead, the statute delegates this \nauthority to the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force \n(the Task Force), the Advisory Committee on Immuniza-\ntion Practices (ACIP), and the Health Resources and \nServices Administration (HRSA)\u2014and it empowers \nthese bodies to unilaterally determine the \u201cpreventive \n \n2. The Affordable Care Act exempts \u201cgrandfathered\u201d plans from \nthese preventive-care coverage requirement. See 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 18011; 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 147.140. Short-term limited-duration insur-\nance plans are also exempt from these coverage mandates. See \nDepartment of Health and Human Services, Short-Term, Lim-\nited-Duration Insurance, 83 Fed. Reg. 38,212 (2018).  \n\n \n \n \n4\ncare\u201d that should be covered and impose their compulso-\nry-coverage edicts on private insurers. See 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 300gg-13 (Pet. App. 142a\u2013143a).  \nSection 300gg-13(a) contains four subsections that \nconfer these powers on the Task Force, ACIP, and \nHRSA. The statute reads as follows:  \nA group health plan and a health insurance is-\nsuer offering group or individual health insur-\nance coverage shall, at a minimum provide cov-\nerage for and shall not impose any cost sharing \nrequirements for\u2014 \n(1) evidence-based items or services that have \nin effect a rating of \u2018\u2018A\u2019\u2019 or \u2018\u2018B\u2019\u2019 in the current \nrecommendations of the United States Preven-\ntive Services Task Force; \n(2) immunizations that have in effect a recom-\nmendation from the Advisory Committee on \nImmunization Practices of the Centers for Dis-\nease Control and Prevention with respect to \nthe individual involved; and3 \n(3) with respect to infants, children, and ado-\nlescents, evidence-informed preventive care \nand screenings provided for in the comprehen-\nsive guidelines supported by the Health Re-\nsources and Services Administration.4  \n \n3. So in original. The word \u201cand\u201d probably should not appear. \n4. So in original. The period probably should be a semicolon. \n\n \n \n \n5\n(4) with respect to women, such additional pre-\nventive care and screenings not described in \nparagraph (1) as provided for in comprehensive \nguidelines supported by the Health Resources \nand Services Administration for purposes of \nthis paragraph.5 \n(5) for the purposes of this chapter, and for the \npurposes of any other provision of law, the cur-\nrent recommendations of the United States \nPreventive Service Task Force regarding \nbreast cancer screening, mammography, and \nprevention shall be considered the most cur-\nrent other than those issued in or around No-\nvember 2009. \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(a).  \nThe \u201crecommendations\u201d and \u201cguidelines\u201d issued by \nthe Task Force, ACIP, and HRSA do not immediately \ncompel private insurers to cover the relevant care or \nservices. Instead, the ACA requires the Secretary of \nHealth and Human Services to establish a \u201cminimum in-\nterval\u201d of at least one year between the issuance of a \n\u201crecommendation\u201d or \u201cguideline\u201d and the plan year in \nwhich it becomes binding on private insurers:  \n(1) In general \nThe Secretary shall establish a minimum in-\nterval between the date on which a recommen-\ndation described in subsection (a)(1) or (a)(2) or \n \n5. So in original. The period probably should be a semicolon. \n\n \n \n \n6\na guideline under subsection (a)(3) is issued \nand the plan year with respect to which the re-\nquirement described in subsection (a) is effec-\ntive with respect to the service described in \nsuch recommendation or guideline. \n(2) Minimum \nThe interval described in paragraph (1) shall \nnot be less than 1 year. \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(b). The \u201cminimum interval\u201d re-\nquirement does not apply to HRSA\u2019s guidelines regard-\ning preventive care and screenings for women. See 42 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(4). \nSince the Affordable Care Act\u2019s enactment, these en-\ntities have issued numerous decrees that force health-\ninsurance issuers and self-insured plans to cover certain \nforms of preventive care without cost-sharing. In 2011, \nfor example, the Health Resources and Services Admin-\nistration issued a highly controversial pronouncement \nthat compels private insurance to cover all FDA-\napproved contraceptive methods, including contraceptive \nmethods that some regard as abortifacients\u2014and to do \nso without requiring the beneficiary to pay anything in \ncopays or out-of-pocket expenses, and without allowing \nthe expenses to count toward an annual deductible. See \nBurwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc., 573 U.S. 682, 733 \n(2014). In June of 2019, the U.S. Preventive Services \nTask Force issued an equally controversial diktat that \nrequires all private insurers to cover pre-exposure \nprophylaxis (PrEP) drugs such as Truvada and Descovy \nstarting in 2021. These drugs, like contraception, must \n\n \n \n \n7\nbe covered without any cost-sharing arrangements and \nmust be funded entirely by premiums paid by others, \nwithout any marginal costs imposed on the beneficiary.  \nI. \nTHE U.S. PREVENTIVE SERVICES TASK FORCE \nThe U.S. Preventive Services Task Force was created \nin 1984, and the statute governing the Task Force is codi-\nfied at 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a) (Pet. App. 138a\u2013141a). The \nTask Force\u2019s statutory mandate is to \u201creview the scien-\ntific evidence related to the effectiveness, appropriate-\nness, and cost-effectiveness of clinical preventive ser-\nvices for the purpose of developing recommendations for \nthe health care community, and updating previous clini-\ncal preventive recommendations.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-\n4(a)(1); see also 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(2) (listing other \n\u201cduties\u201d of the Task Force).  \nThe statute governing the Task Force requires the \nDirector of the Agency for Healthcare Research and \nQuality (AHRQ) to \u201cconvene\u201d an \u201cindependent Preven-\ntive Services Task Force\u201d for these purposes. 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 299b-4(a)(1). The statute requires that the Task Force \nbe \u201ccomposed of individuals with appropriate expertise.\u201d \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(1). The statute also guarantees the \nindependence of the Task Force and its recommenda-\ntions by specifying that:  \nAll members of the Task Force convened under \nthis subsection, and any recommendations \nmade by such members, shall be independent \nand, to the extent practicable, not subject to \npolitical pressure. \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(6).  \n\n \n \n \n8\nAlthough the statute does not specify the number of \nTask Force members and is silent about their tenure, \nthere are currently 16 Task Force members and each of \nthem has been appointed to a four-year term.6 Until \nJune of 2023, Task Force members were appointed by \nthe Director of the Agency for Healthcare Research and \nQuality (AHRQ).7 In response to this lawsuit, however, \nthe Task Force members received new appointments \nfrom Secretary Becerra in an effort to blunt the plain-\ntiffs\u2019 Appointments Clause challenge to 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 300gg-13(a)(1).8 \nBefore the enactment of the Affordable Care Act, the \nTask Force performed only advisory functions, and its \n\u201crecommendations\u201d had no binding legal force. And be-\n \n6. See http://bit.ly/48cdU9X [https://perma.cc/7DJS-5VAF]; see al-\nso Pet. at 4. \n7. See http://bit.ly/3Nrntbo [https://perma.cc/B68B-VTMW] (ar-\nchived website taken on September 28, 2023) (\u201cTask Force \nmembers are appointed by the Director of AHRQ to serve 4-\nyear terms.\u201d).  \n8. See Secretary of HHS, Ratification of Prior Appointment and \nProspective Appointment: Appointment Affidavits (June 28, \n2023), http://bit.ly/3Yt94C0 [https://perma.cc/8TAA-7AMN]; see \nalso http://bit.ly/4dR3xK7 (archived website taken on December \n20, 2023) (\u201cTask Force members are appointed by the Secretary \nof HHS to serve 4-year terms.\u201d); Opening Br. for the Federal \nDefendants, Braidwood Management Inc. v. Becerra, No. 23-\n10326 (5th Cir.), ECF No. 159, at 30, available at \nhttp://bit.ly/40b9IFt [https://perma.cc/SYK3-FPBA] (\u201cAlthough \nthe existing Task Force members have not yet received an ap-\npointment consistent with the Appointments Clause, the Secre-\ntary has authority to appoint Task Force members and is in the \nprocess of providing them with a constitutional appointment.\u201d). \n\n \n \n \n9\ncause the Task Force served as a purely advisory com-\nmittee before the ACA, its members did not wield \u201csig-\nnificant authority pursuant to the laws of the United \nStates\u201d9 and did not qualify as \u201cofficers of the United \nStates\u201d under Article II of the Constitution. See Walter \nDellinger, Constitutional Limitations on Federal Gov-\nernment Participation in Binding Arbitration, 19 U.S. \nOp. Off. Legal Counsel 208, 216 (1995) (\u201c[T]he members \nof a commission that has purely advisory functions need \nnot be officers of the United States because they possess \nno enforcement authority or power to bind the Govern-\nment.\u201d (citation and internal quotation marks omitted)). \nBut the Task Force no longer acts in a \u201cpurely advisory\u201d \nrole now that 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(1) empowers the \nTask Force to unilaterally dictate the preventive care \nthat health insurance must cover without cost sharing. \nThe members of the Task Force became \u201cofficers of the \nUnited States\u201d when the Affordable Care Act was signed \ninto law\u2014and they must be appointed consistent with \nthe requirements of Article II.  \nII. THE PLAINTIFFS\u2019 LAWSUIT \nOn March 29, 2020, the plaintiffs sued and asked a \nfederal district court to declare 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-\n13(a)(1) unconstitutional and enjoin the government \nfrom enforcing the preventive-care coverage mandates \n \n9. Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1, 126 (1976) (per curiam); see also id. \n(\u201c[A]ny appointee exercising significant authority pursuant to \nthe laws of the United States is an \u2018Officer of the United States,\u2019 \nand must, therefore, be appointed in the manner prescribed by \n\u00a7 2, cl. 2, of that Article.\u201d). \n\n \n \n \n10 \nimposed by the Task Force.10 The plaintiffs argued that \nthe Task Force members qualify as \u201cofficers of the Unit-\ned States\u201d under Article II because they wield \u201csignifi-\ncant authority pursuant to the laws of the United \nStates\u201d11\u2014and that they must therefore be appointed by \nthe president with the Senate\u2019s advice and consent. And \nbecause the Task Force members were not appointed as \n\u201cofficers of the United States\u201d in conformity with Article \nII, their \u201crecommendations\u201d cannot be given legal force \nand cannot bind private insurers. \nIn response to the plaintiffs\u2019 lawsuit, Secretary \nBecerra issued a document on January 21, 2022, that \npurports to \u201cratify\u201d all preventive-care coverage man-\ndates that had previously been imposed by the Task \nForce. App. 5a\u20136a. \nA. The District Court\u2019s Ruling \nThe district court agreed with the plaintiffs that the \nmembers of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force \nqualify as \u201cofficers of the United States\u201d because they (1) \noccupy a \u201ccontinuing position established by law\u201d and (2) \nexercise \u201csignificant authority pursuant to the laws of \nthe United States.\u201d Pet. App. 107a (quoting Lucia v. \nSEC, 585 U.S. 237, 245 (2018)). The district court further \nheld that the Task Force members are \u201cprincipal\u201d offic-\ners who must be appointed by the president with the \n \n10. The plaintiffs raised other claims in the district court and in the \ncourt of appeals, but none of those claims are at issue in the So-\nlicitor General\u2019s petition.  \n11. See Buckley, 424 U.S. at 126; see also Jennifer L. Mascott, Who \nAre \u201cOfficers of the United States\u201d?, 70 Stan. L. Rev. 443 (2018). \n\n \n \n \n11 \nSenate\u2019s advice and consent, rather than \u201cinferior\u201d offic-\ners who can be appointed by a Head of Department. Pet. \nApp. 115a\u2013116a; see also U.S. Const. art. II, \u00a7 2 (\u201c[B]ut \nthe Congress may by Law vest the Appointment of such \ninterior officers, as they think proper, in the President \nalone, in the Courts of Law, or in the Heads of Depart-\nments.\u201d). The district court explained that \u201cinferior\u201d of-\nficers must be \u201c \u2018directed and supervised at some level by \nothers who were appointed by Presidential nomination \nwith the advice and consent of the Senate.\u2019 \u201d Pet. App. \n115a (quoting Edmond v. United States, 520 U.S. 651, \n663 (1997)). And it held that Task Force members cannot \nqualify as \u201cinferior\u201d officers because \u201cthey have no supe-\nrior\u201d12 and because 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(6) guarantees \ntheir independence and shields the Task Force and its \nrecommendations from \u201cpolitical pressure.\u201d Pet. App. \n115a\u2013116a; see also 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(6) (\u201cAll mem-\nbers of the Task Force convened under this subsection, \nand any recommendations made by such members, shall \nbe independent and, to the extent practicable, not sub-\nject to political pressure.\u201d).  \nThe district court also held, in the alternative, that \nthe Task Force members would be unconstitutionally ap-\npointed even if they were deemed \u201cinferior\u201d officers be-\ncause they were appointed by the AHRQ director, who is \nnot a \u201cHead of Department\u201d under Article.

It also empowers the U.S. Preventive \nServices Task Force to dictate and decree the preventive \ncare that private insurance must cover. See 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 300gg-13(a)(1). A separate statute requires that the \nTask Force members and their preventive-care coverage \nedicts be \u201cindependent and, to the extent practicable, not \nsubject to political pressure.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(6). \nThe court of appeals held that the Task Force mem-\nbers are \u201cprincipal officers\u201d who must be appointed by \nthe president with Senate confirmation. The court of ap-\npeals reached this conclusion because of the powers that \nthe Task Force wields under the Affordable Care Act, \nand because 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(6) shields the Task \nForce from direction or supervision by others. And be-\ncause the Task Force members were not appointed in \nconformity with Article II, the court of appeals enjoined \nSecretary Becerra from enforcing the Task Force\u2019s pre-\nventive-care coverage mandates against the plaintiffs. \nThe questions presented are: \n1. Did the court of appeals correctly hold that \nthe Task Force members are \u201cprincipal offic-\ners\u201d who must be appointed by the president \nwith Senate confirmation? \n2. Did the court of appeals correctly refuse the \ndefendants\u2019 request to \u201csever,\u201d i.e., nullify, 42 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(6) and allow Secretary Be-\ncerra to direct and supervise the Task Force\u2019s \npreventive-care coverage decisions? \n \n\n \n(ii) \nTABLE OF CONTENTS \nQuestions presented ............................................................. i \nTable of contents .................................................................. ii \nAppendix .............................................................................. iii \nTable of authorities ............................................................. iv \nOpinions below ....................................................................... 2 \nJurisdiction ............................................................................. 3 \nConstitutional and statutory provisions involved ............. 3 \nStatement ............................................................................... 3 \nI.

Pet. App. 1a\u201326a. And when \na lower court holds an Act of Congress unconstitutional, \nthis Court\u2019s usual practice is to grant certiorari without \nawaiting a circuit split\u2014especially when the contested \nlegislation is as significant as the Affordable Care Act. \nSee, e.g., National Federation of Independent Business \nv. Sebelius, 565 U.S. 1033 (2011); California v. Texas, 140 \nS. Ct. 1262 (2020); see also Pet. at 27\u201328 (citing authori-\n\n \n \n \n2\nties). The Solicitor General is also correct to observe that \na denial of certiorari will open the door for a new plaintiff \nto sue within the fifth circuit and obtain a nationwide \nremedy that will vacate all agency actions taken to im-\nplement the preventive-care coverage mandates recom-\nmended by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force \nsince March 23, 2010. See Pet. at 30\u201331. The respondents \nbelieve that this Court should weigh in on the constitu-\ntionality of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(1) and the appoint-\nments of the Task Force members before that happens. \nThe respondents disagree with the Solicitor Gen-\neral\u2019s criticisms of the court of appeals\u2019 opinion, as well \nas her dire predictions of what might happen if the court \nof appeals\u2019 ruling is allowed to stand. But none of those \ndisagreements affect the certworthiness of this case. The \npetition satisfies this Court\u2019s criteria for certiorari and \npresents an issue of exceptional importance. And there \nare no vehicle problems that might counsel in favor of \nwaiting for a different case. The Court should grant the \npetition. \nOPINIONS BELOW \nThe opinion of the court of appeals is reported at 104 \nF.4th 930 and reproduced at Pet. App. 1a\u201348a. The opin-\nions of the district court are reported at 666 F. Supp. 3d \n613 and 627 F. Supp. 3d 624 and reproduced at Pet. App. \n49a\u201384a and Pet. App. 85a\u2013136a.1 \n \n1. Throughout this brief, we will use \u201cPet. App.\u201d to refer to the \nappendix to the petition filed by the Solicitor General. We will \nuse \u201cApp.\u201d to refer to the appendix attached to the respondents\u2019 \nbrief in support of certiorari. \n\n \n \n \n3\nJURISDICTION \nThe court of appeals entered its judgment on June \n21, 2024. The Solicitor General timely petitioned for cer-\ntiorari on September 19, 2024. This Court has jurisdic-\ntion under 28 U.S.C. 1254(1). \nCONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY PROVISIONS \nINVOLVED \nThe relevant constitutional and statutory provisions \nappear in the appendix to the Solicitor General\u2019s petition. \nPet. App. 137a\u2013143a. \nSTATEMENT \nThe Affordable Care Act requires most private \nhealth insurers to cover certain forms of preventive care \nwithout any cost-sharing arrangements such as deducti-\nbles, co-pays, or out-of-pocket expenses. See 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 300gg-13(a) (Pet. App. 142a\u2013143a).2 The statute does \nnot specify or delineate the preventive care that private \ninsurers must cover. Instead, the statute delegates this \nauthority to the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force \n(the Task Force), the Advisory Committee on Immuniza-\ntion Practices (ACIP), and the Health Resources and \nServices Administration (HRSA)\u2014and it empowers \nthese bodies to unilaterally determine the \u201cpreventive \n \n2. The Affordable Care Act exempts \u201cgrandfathered\u201d plans from \nthese preventive-care coverage requirement. See 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 18011; 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 147.140. Short-term limited-duration insur-\nance plans are also exempt from these coverage mandates. See \nDepartment of Health and Human Services, Short-Term, Lim-\nited-Duration Insurance, 83 Fed. Reg. 38,212 (2018).  \n\n \n \n \n4\ncare\u201d that should be covered and impose their compulso-\nry-coverage edicts on private insurers. See 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 300gg-13 (Pet. App. 142a\u2013143a).  \nSection 300gg-13(a) contains four subsections that \nconfer these powers on the Task Force, ACIP, and \nHRSA. The statute reads as follows:  \nA group health plan and a health insurance is-\nsuer offering group or individual health insur-\nance coverage shall, at a minimum provide cov-\nerage for and shall not impose any cost sharing \nrequirements for\u2014 \n(1) evidence-based items or services that have \nin effect a rating of \u2018\u2018A\u2019\u2019 or \u2018\u2018B\u2019\u2019 in the current \nrecommendations of the United States Preven-\ntive Services Task Force; \n(2) immunizations that have in effect a recom-\nmendation from the Advisory Committee on \nImmunization Practices of the Centers for Dis-\nease Control and Prevention with respect to \nthe individual involved; and3 \n(3) with respect to infants, children, and ado-\nlescents, evidence-informed preventive care \nand screenings provided for in the comprehen-\nsive guidelines supported by the Health Re-\nsources and Services Administration.4  \n \n3. So in original. The word \u201cand\u201d probably should not appear. \n4. So in original. The period probably should be a semicolon. \n\n \n \n \n5\n(4) with respect to women, such additional pre-\nventive care and screenings not described in \nparagraph (1) as provided for in comprehensive \nguidelines supported by the Health Resources \nand Services Administration for purposes of \nthis paragraph.5 \n(5) for the purposes of this chapter, and for the \npurposes of any other provision of law, the cur-\nrent recommendations of the United States \nPreventive Service Task Force regarding \nbreast cancer screening, mammography, and \nprevention shall be considered the most cur-\nrent other than those issued in or around No-\nvember 2009. \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(a).  \nThe \u201crecommendations\u201d and \u201cguidelines\u201d issued by \nthe Task Force, ACIP, and HRSA do not immediately \ncompel private insurers to cover the relevant care or \nservices. Instead, the ACA requires the Secretary of \nHealth and Human Services to establish a \u201cminimum in-\nterval\u201d of at least one year between the issuance of a \n\u201crecommendation\u201d or \u201cguideline\u201d and the plan year in \nwhich it becomes binding on private insurers:  \n(1) In general \nThe Secretary shall establish a minimum in-\nterval between the date on which a recommen-\ndation described in subsection (a)(1) or (a)(2) or \n \n5. So in original. The period probably should be a semicolon. \n\n \n \n \n6\na guideline under subsection (a)(3) is issued \nand the plan year with respect to which the re-\nquirement described in subsection (a) is effec-\ntive with respect to the service described in \nsuch recommendation or guideline. \n(2) Minimum \nThe interval described in paragraph (1) shall \nnot be less than 1 year. \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(b). The \u201cminimum interval\u201d re-\nquirement does not apply to HRSA\u2019s guidelines regard-\ning preventive care and screenings for women. See 42 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(4). \nSince the Affordable Care Act\u2019s enactment, these en-\ntities have issued numerous decrees that force health-\ninsurance issuers and self-insured plans to cover certain \nforms of preventive care without cost-sharing. In 2011, \nfor example, the Health Resources and Services Admin-\nistration issued a highly controversial pronouncement \nthat compels private insurance to cover all FDA-\napproved contraceptive methods, including contraceptive \nmethods that some regard as abortifacients\u2014and to do \nso without requiring the beneficiary to pay anything in \ncopays or out-of-pocket expenses, and without allowing \nthe expenses to count toward an annual deductible. See \nBurwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc., 573 U.S. 682, 733 \n(2014). In June of 2019, the U.S. Preventive Services \nTask Force issued an equally controversial diktat that \nrequires all private insurers to cover pre-exposure \nprophylaxis (PrEP) drugs such as Truvada and Descovy \nstarting in 2021. These drugs, like contraception, must \n\n \n \n \n7\nbe covered without any cost-sharing arrangements and \nmust be funded entirely by premiums paid by others, \nwithout any marginal costs imposed on the beneficiary.  \nI. \nTHE U.S. PREVENTIVE SERVICES TASK FORCE \nThe U.S. Preventive Services Task Force was created \nin 1984, and the statute governing the Task Force is codi-\nfied at 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a) (Pet. App. 138a\u2013141a). The \nTask Force\u2019s statutory mandate is to \u201creview the scien-\ntific evidence related to the effectiveness, appropriate-\nness, and cost-effectiveness of clinical preventive ser-\nvices for the purpose of developing recommendations for \nthe health care community, and updating previous clini-\ncal preventive recommendations.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-\n4(a)(1); see also 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(2) (listing other \n\u201cduties\u201d of the Task Force).  \nThe statute governing the Task Force requires the \nDirector of the Agency for Healthcare Research and \nQuality (AHRQ) to \u201cconvene\u201d an \u201cindependent Preven-\ntive Services Task Force\u201d for these purposes. 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 299b-4(a)(1). The statute requires that the Task Force \nbe \u201ccomposed of individuals with appropriate expertise.\u201d \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(1). The statute also guarantees the \nindependence of the Task Force and its recommenda-\ntions by specifying that:  \nAll members of the Task Force convened under \nthis subsection, and any recommendations \nmade by such members, shall be independent \nand, to the extent practicable, not subject to \npolitical pressure. \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(6).  \n\n \n \n \n8\nAlthough the statute does not specify the number of \nTask Force members and is silent about their tenure, \nthere are currently 16 Task Force members and each of \nthem has been appointed to a four-year term.6 Until \nJune of 2023, Task Force members were appointed by \nthe Director of the Agency for Healthcare Research and \nQuality (AHRQ).7 In response to this lawsuit, however, \nthe Task Force members received new appointments \nfrom Secretary Becerra in an effort to blunt the plain-\ntiffs\u2019 Appointments Clause challenge to 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 300gg-13(a)(1).8 \nBefore the enactment of the Affordable Care Act, the \nTask Force performed only advisory functions, and its \n\u201crecommendations\u201d had no binding legal force. And be-\n \n6. See http://bit.ly/48cdU9X [https://perma.cc/7DJS-5VAF]; see al-\nso Pet. at 4. \n7.

Becerra, No. 23-\n10326 (5th Cir.), ECF No. 159, at 30, available at \nhttp://bit.ly/40b9IFt [https://perma.cc/SYK3-FPBA] (\u201cAlthough \nthe existing Task Force members have not yet received an ap-\npointment consistent with the Appointments Clause, the Secre-\ntary has authority to appoint Task Force members and is in the \nprocess of providing them with a constitutional appointment.\u201d). \n\n \n \n \n9\ncause the Task Force served as a purely advisory com-\nmittee before the ACA, its members did not wield \u201csig-\nnificant authority pursuant to the laws of the United \nStates\u201d9 and did not qualify as \u201cofficers of the United \nStates\u201d under Article II of the Constitution. See Walter \nDellinger, Constitutional Limitations on Federal Gov-\nernment Participation in Binding Arbitration, 19 U.S. \nOp. Off. Legal Counsel 208, 216 (1995) (\u201c[T]he members \nof a commission that has purely advisory functions need \nnot be officers of the United States because they possess \nno enforcement authority or power to bind the Govern-\nment.\u201d (citation and internal quotation marks omitted)). \nBut the Task Force no longer acts in a \u201cpurely advisory\u201d \nrole now that 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(1) empowers the \nTask Force to unilaterally dictate the preventive care \nthat health insurance must cover without cost sharing. \nThe members of the Task Force became \u201cofficers of the \nUnited States\u201d when the Affordable Care Act was signed \ninto law\u2014and they must be appointed consistent with \nthe requirements of Article II.  \nII. THE PLAINTIFFS\u2019 LAWSUIT \nOn March 29, 2020, the plaintiffs sued and asked a \nfederal district court to declare 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-\n13(a)(1) unconstitutional and enjoin the government \nfrom enforcing the preventive-care coverage mandates \n \n9. Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1, 126 (1976) (per curiam); see also id. \n(\u201c[A]ny appointee exercising significant authority pursuant to \nthe laws of the United States is an \u2018Officer of the United States,\u2019 \nand must, therefore, be appointed in the manner prescribed by \n\u00a7 2, cl. 2, of that Article.\u201d). \n\n \n \n \n10 \nimposed by the Task Force.10 The plaintiffs argued that \nthe Task Force members qualify as \u201cofficers of the Unit-\ned States\u201d under Article II because they wield \u201csignifi-\ncant authority pursuant to the laws of the United \nStates\u201d11\u2014and that they must therefore be appointed by \nthe president with the Senate\u2019s advice and consent. And \nbecause the Task Force members were not appointed as \n\u201cofficers of the United States\u201d in conformity with Article \nII, their \u201crecommendations\u201d cannot be given legal force \nand cannot bind private insurers. \nIn response to the plaintiffs\u2019 lawsuit, Secretary \nBecerra issued a document on January 21, 2022, that \npurports to \u201cratify\u201d all preventive-care coverage man-\ndates that had previously been imposed by the Task \nForce. App. 5a\u20136a. \nA. The District Court\u2019s Ruling \nThe district court agreed with the plaintiffs that the \nmembers of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force \nqualify as \u201cofficers of the United States\u201d because they (1) \noccupy a \u201ccontinuing position established by law\u201d and (2) \nexercise \u201csignificant authority pursuant to the laws of \nthe United States.\u201d Pet. App. 107a (quoting Lucia v. \nSEC, 585 U.S. 237, 245 (2018)). The district court further \nheld that the Task Force members are \u201cprincipal\u201d offic-\ners who must be appointed by the president with the \n \n10. The plaintiffs raised other claims in the district court and in the \ncourt of appeals, but none of those claims are at issue in the So-\nlicitor General\u2019s petition.  \n11. See Buckley, 424 U.S. at 126; see also Jennifer L. Mascott, Who \nAre \u201cOfficers of the United States\u201d?, 70 Stan. L. Rev. 443 (2018). \n\n \n \n \n11 \nSenate\u2019s advice and consent, rather than \u201cinferior\u201d offic-\ners who can be appointed by a Head of Department.

II, \u00a7 2 (\u201c[B]ut \nthe Congress may by Law vest the Appointment of such \ninterior officers, as they think proper, in the President \nalone, in the Courts of Law, or in the Heads of Depart-\nments.\u201d). The district court explained that \u201cinferior\u201d of-\nficers must be \u201c \u2018directed and supervised at some level by \nothers who were appointed by Presidential nomination \nwith the advice and consent of the Senate.\u2019 \u201d Pet. App. \n115a (quoting Edmond v. United States, 520 U.S. 651, \n663 (1997)). And it held that Task Force members cannot \nqualify as \u201cinferior\u201d officers because \u201cthey have no supe-\nrior\u201d12 and because 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(6) guarantees \ntheir independence and shields the Task Force and its \nrecommendations from \u201cpolitical pressure.\u201d Pet. App. \n115a\u2013116a; see also 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(6) (\u201cAll mem-\nbers of the Task Force convened under this subsection, \nand any recommendations made by such members, shall \nbe independent and, to the extent practicable, not sub-\nject to political pressure.\u201d).  \nThe district court also held, in the alternative, that \nthe Task Force members would be unconstitutionally ap-\npointed even if they were deemed \u201cinferior\u201d officers be-\ncause they were appointed by the AHRQ director, who is \nnot a \u201cHead of Department\u201d under Article. II. Pet. App. \n116a (\u201c \u2018[T]he term \u201cDepartment\u201d refers only to a part or \ndivision of the executive government, as the Department \nof State, or of the Treasury, expressly created and given \n \n12.

In accordance with its \nuniversal vacatur remedy under section 706, the district \ncourt issued a concomitant nationwide injunction that \nrestrained the defendants from \u201cimplementing or enforc-\ning\u201d the ACA\u2019s preventive-services \u201ccoverage require-\nments in response to an \u2018A\u2019 or \u2018B\u2019 rating from the Task \nForce in the future.\u201d Pet. App. 83a.  \nB. The Appellate-Court Proceedings \nThe defendants appealed and asked for a stay pend-\ning appeal of the district court\u2019s universal remedies. The \nplaintiffs eventually stipulated to a stay of the nation-\nwide injunction and the universal vacatur of the disputed \n\u201cagency actions,\u201d leaving in place only relief that shields \nthe named plaintiffs from statutory penalties and en-\nforcement actions for violations of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-\n13(a)(1).13 In exchange for this stipulation, the defend-\nants promised that they would not seek penalties against \nthe plaintiffs for actions taken in reliance on the district \ncourt\u2019s judgment if that judgment were to be vacated or \nnarrowed on appeal.14  \n \n13.

The \nCourt \nOf \nAppeals\u2019 \nRuling \nOn \nThe \nAppointments Clause Issues \nThe court of appeals affirmed the district court\u2019s rul-\ning that the Task Force members were unconstitutional-\nly appointed. Pet. App. 12a\u201326a. The court of appeals al-\nso agreed with the district court (and the plaintiffs) that \nthe Task Force members are \u201cprincipal\u201d officers who \nmust be appointed by the President with the Senate\u2019s \nadvice and consent, rather than \u201cinferior\u201d officers who \ncan be appointed by a Head of Department.

[W]e \nneed look no further than the statutory provi-\nsion we just addressed, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-\n4(a)(6), which again provides that \u201c[a]ll mem-\nbers of the Task Force . . . , and any recom-\nmendations made by such members, shall be \nindependent and, to the extent practicable, not \nsubject to political pressure.\u201d . . . . [I]t is a clear \nand express directive from Congress that the \nTask Force be free from any supervision. In \nour view, the Task Force cannot be \u201cindepend-\nent\u201d and free from \u201cpolitical pressure\u201d on the \none hand, and at the same time be supervised \nby the HHS Secretary, a political appointee, on \nthe other. \nPet. App. 20a. The court of appeals declined the defend-\nants\u2019 invitation to invoke the constitutional-avoidance \ncanon and construe 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(6) in a manner \nthat would allow the Secretary to \u201cdirect\u201d and \u201csuper-\nvise\u201d the Task Force\u2019s recommendations, holding that \nany such interpretation of section 299b-4(a)(6) would be \nincompatible with the statutory text and structure. Pet. \nApp. 23a (\u201c[T]he statutory scheme . . . envisions no su-\npervisory role for the Secretary, and that is especially \nclear in light of the express congressional preference \nthat the Task Force be independent and not subject to \npolitical pressure.\u201d); see also Jennings v. Rodriguez, 583 \n\n \n \n \n17 \nU.S. 281, 296 (2018) (constitutional-avoidance canon may \nnot be invoked unless the proposed interpretation is both \n\u201cplausible\u201d and \u201cfairly possible\u201d).  \n2. The Court Of Appeals\u2019 Ruling On The Remedial \nIssues \nThe court of appeals rejected the universal remedy \nimposed by the district court because the plaintiffs had \nfailed to explicitly assert an APA claim in their pleading. \nPet. App. 37a. But the court of appeals left in place the \ndeclaratory and injunctive relief that restrains the de-\nfendants from enforcing 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(1) and \nthe Task Force \u201crecommendations\u201d against the named \nplaintiffs. Pet. App. 30a\u201343a.  \nThe defendants had proposed a different remedy that \nwould \u201csever the limitations on secretarial oversight in \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(6)\u201d and authorize Secretary Becer-\nra to direct and supervise the Task Force\u2019s preventive-\ncare coverage mandates despite the restrictions under \nsection 299b-4(a)(6). Pet. App. 30a (internal quotation \nmarks omitted). But the court of appeals rejected this \nremedy because the federal judiciary has no power to \nformally revoke a statute or confer new powers on a cab-\ninet secretary that Congress has explicitly withheld. Pet. \nApp. 31a\u201333a.  \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nThe Court should grant certiorari for three reasons. \nFirst, the court of appeals determined that 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 300gg-13(a)(1) violates the Appointments Clause by \nconferring authority on Task Force members who were \nnot appointed in conformity with Article II. This Court \n\n \n \n \n18 \nwill almost always grant certiorari when a lower court \npronounces an Act of Congress unconstitutional, and \nthere is nothing out of the ordinary that might be in-\nvoked to suggest a different approach here.  \nSecond, although the court of appeals rejected the \ndistrict court\u2019s universal remedy and limited relief to the \nnamed plaintiffs, a denial of certiorari will leave the court \nof appeals\u2019 ruling and opinion in place as binding prece-\ndent in the fifth circuit. This will allow other plaintiffs in \nthe fifth circuit to sue the defendants under the APA and \nobtain the universal remedies that the district court had \nawarded under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(a), as the precedent of \nthe fifth circuit compels federal district courts to \u201cset \naside,\u201d i.e., formally vacate, any \u201cagency actions\u201d taken \nto implement 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(1) or the preven-\ntive-care coverage mandates recommended by the Task \nForce. See In re Clarke, 94 F.4th 502, 512 (5th Cir. 2024) \n(\u201cShould plaintiffs prevail on their APA challenge, this \ncourt must \u2018set aside\u2019 CFTC\u2019s ultra vires recission ac-\ntion, with nationwide effect.\u201d). This Court should rule on \nthe merits of the plaintiffs\u2019 constitutional claims before \nauthorizing a dramatic nationwide remedy of this sort.  \nThird, this petition presents a suitable vehicle for \nreaching the Appointments Clause and remedial issues \ndiscussed in the Solicitor General\u2019s petition. There are no \nlingering jurisdictional issues that might prevent this \nCourt from reaching the merits, and no competing peti-\ntions (or soon-to-be-filed petitions) in the pipeline. \n\n \n \n \n19 \nARGUMENT \nI. \nTHE \nCOURT\u2019S \nNORMAL \nPRACTICE \nIS \nTO \nGRANT \nCERTIORARI \nWHEN \nAN \nACT \nOF \nCONGRESS IS HELD UNCONSTITUTIONAL  \nAs the Solicitor General observes, this Court\u2019s usual \npractice is to grant certiorari when a lower court finds an \nAct of Congress unconstitutional, without regard to \nwhether the lower court\u2019s ruling implicates a circuit con-\nflict. Pet. 27\u201328 (citing authorities). And for good reason. \nThis Court has repeatedly (and correctly) observed that \npronouncing an Act of Congress unconstitutional is \u201c \u2018the \ngravest and most delicate\u2019 \u201d task of the federal judiciary. \nShelby County v. Holder, 570 U.S. 529, 556 (2013) (quot-\ning Blodgett v. Holden, 275 U.S. 142, 148 (1927) (Holmes, \nJ., concurring)). The respect to which Congress is enti-\ntled as a coordinate branch of the federal government \ndemands review from the highest court before a federal \nstatute\u2019s enforcement is permanently thwarted or en-\njoined. \nThe Solicitor General suggests that the lower courts \nmerely declared the Task Force\u2019s structure unconstitu-\ntional,18 but the rulings also address the constitutionality \nof the underlying legislation. The court of appeals\u2019 ruling \nmeans that 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(1) is unconstitutional \nto the extent it confers authority on Task Force members \nwho were not appointed by the president with the Sen-\nate\u2019s advice and consent. Pet. App. 12a\u201326a. And the dis-\n \n18. Pet. at 27 (\u201cThe Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision declares the Task \nForce\u2019s structure unconstitutional\u201d).  \n\n \n \n \n20 \ntrict court\u2019s judgment (as modified by the court of ap-\npeals) continues to enjoin the government from enforc-\ning 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(1) against the named plain-\ntiffs. App. 2a. The statute itself was ruled unconstitu-\ntional\u2014at least in part and at least as applied to the \nplaintiffs\u2014and that warrants review consistent with the \nlongstanding practice of this Court.  \nThere is also no reason to depart from the Court\u2019s \nusual practice here. The federal statute at issue is of im-\nmense importance, and it is a key component of one of \nthe most significant and controversial pieces of legisla-\ntion that Congress has ever enacted. The Court should \nweigh in rather than leaving the constitutionality of 42 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(1) and the appointments of the Task \nForce members to be resolved entirely by the court of \nappeals. \nII. A DENIAL OF CERTIORARI WILL ALLOW A \nNEW \nLITIGANT \nTO \nSUE \nAND \nOBTAIN \nNATIONWIDE \nRELIEF \nAGAINST \nTHE \nENFORCEMENT OF 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(1)  \nThe Solicitor General is also correct to observe that a \ndenial of certiorari will leave the door open for a new \nplaintiff to sue and quickly revive the universal remedies \nthat the district court had awarded to the plaintiffs. Pet. \nat 30\u201331. The court of appeals vacated the district court\u2019s \nuniversal remedies only because the plaintiffs had not \npleaded an APA claim in their complaint. Pet. App. 37a. \nIn doing so, the court of appeals acknowledged that fifth \ncircuit precedent requires courts to \u201cset aside\u2014i.e., \nformally nullify and revoke\u201d any unlawful agency actions \nthat a litigant challenges under section 706 of the APA. \n\n \n \n \n21 \nPet. App. 35a (quoting Data Marketing Partnership, LP \nv. United States Dep\u2019t of Labor, 45 F.4th 846, 859 (5th \nCir. 2022); see also In re Clarke, 94 F.4th 502, 512 (5th \nCir. 2024) (\u201cShould plaintiffs prevail on their APA chal-\nlenge, this court must \u2018set aside\u2019 CFTC\u2019s ultra vires re-\ncission action, with nationwide effect.\u201d). Vacatur in the \nfifth circuit is a universal remedy that wipes out the dis-\nputed agency actions and prevents the agency from en-\nforcing them against anyone. See id.; Career Colleges & \nSchool of Texas v. United States Dep\u2019t of Education, 98 \nF.4th 220, 255 (5th Cir. 2024) (\u201cSection 706 . . . is not par-\nty-restricted and allows a court to \u2018set aside\u2019 an unlawful \nagency action. The term \u2018set aside\u2019 means invalidation\u2014\nand an invalid rule may not be applied to anyone.\u201d (cita-\ntions and some internal quotation marks omitted)). So if \nthis Court denies certiorari, a new litigant can sue the \ndefendants anywhere in the fifth circuit, and that plain-\ntiff will be entitled to a universal remedy so long as he \npleads a claim under the APA. This will result in a na-\ntionwide injunction that vacates every agency action tak-\nen to enforce 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(1) and the preven-\ntive-care coverage mandates imposed by the Task \nForce.19  \n \n19. The government could try to limit the scope of relief by raising a \nstatute-of-limitations defense. But the plaintiffs can easily get \naround this by recruiting an employer plaintiff that only recent-\nly came into existence, or by creating a new membership associ-\nation and using that as the plaintiff. See Corner Post, Inc. v. \nBoard of Governors of Federal Reserve System, 144 S. Ct. 2440 \n(2024); Students for Fair Admissions, Inc. v. President and \nFellows of Harvard College, 600 U.S. 181, 200\u201301 (2023). \n\n \n \n \n22 \nThe Court should grant certiorari before allowing \nthis to happen. A universal remedy against the enforce-\nment of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(1) will undo every pre-\nventive-care coverage mandate imposed by the Task \nForce with nationwide effect. And a ruling of this sort \nwill surely be appealed (if not by the Department of Jus-\ntice than by a defendant\u2013intervenor) and reach this \nCourt again on petition for certiorari, as any fifth circuit \npanel will remain bound by that court\u2019s precedent on \nboth the constitutional and remedial issues. The sounder \napproach is to grant certiorari now and resolve these is-\nsues, rather than invite a future lawsuit that will restore \nthe universal remedies issued by the district court and \nproduce another certiorari petition presenting the same \nquestions as this one.  \nIII. THERE ARE NO VEHICLE PROBLEMS THAT \nMIGHT COUNSEL IN FAVOR OF WAITING FOR A \nDIFFERENT PETITION \nThis case also presents a suitable vehicle for resolv-\ning the Appointments Clause and remedial issues de-\nscribed in the Solicitor General\u2019s petition. There are no \npotential jurisdictional landmines that could derail this \ncase if certiorari is granted. Braidwood Management \nInc., the lead respondent, easily has Article III standing \nbecause it operates a self-insured plan and employs more \nthan 50 full-time workers.20 Braidwood is compelled by \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(1) and the preventive-care cov-\n \n20. Declaration of Steven F. Hotze \u00b6\u00b6 5\u20136, Braidwood Management \nInc. v. Becerra, No. 4:20-cv-00283-O (N.D. Tex.), ECF No. 46.  \n\n \n \n \n23 \nerage mandates to underwrite services that it would ra-\nther exclude, and it is restricted from imposing any cost-\nsharing arrangements for any of the preventive care de-\ncreed by the Task Force.21 That alone is enough to estab-\nlish standing. See Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc., \n573 U.S. 682, 706 (2014); Pet. App. 95a (\u201cBraidwood pre-\nsents the easiest case for standing.\u201d); id. (\u201c[T]he man-\ndates deprive Braidwood of the ability to choose whether \nand to what extent its insurance plan covers preventive \ncare.\u201d); Pet. App. 95a\u201397a (describing each of Braid-\nwood\u2019s Article III injuries). And there is no need for any \nof the remaining respondents to make an independent \nshowing of standing when Braidwood\u2019s standing is se-\ncure. See Biden v. Nebraska, 600 U.S. 477, 489 (2023) (\u201cIf \nat least one plaintiff has standing, the suit may pro-\nceed.\u201d).22  \n \n21. Declaration of Steven F. Hotze \u00b6\u00b6 7\u201319, Braidwood Manage-\nment Inc. v. Becerra, No. 4:20-cv-00283-O (N.D. Tex.), ECF No. \n46. \n22. The Solicitor General notes that Braidwood \u201cdoes not allege . . . \nthat any of its employees have ever sought coverage for PrEP \nmedications.\u201d Pet. at 7. But that does not defeat Braidwood\u2019s \nArticle III standing to challenge the appointments of the Task \nForce members, or the lawfulness of the PrEP drug coverage \nmandate, and the Solicitor General does not argue or even sug-\ngest that it does. The mere requirement to provide this cover-\nage inflicts injury in fact because it requires Braidwood to alter \nthe content and scope of its self-insured plan documents. See \nUnited States v. Students Challenging Regulatory Agency Pro-\ncedures (SCRAP), 412 U.S. 669, 689 n.14 (1973) (\u201c[A]n identifia-\nble trifle is enough for standing\u201d (citation and internal quotation \nmarks omitted)). \n\n \n \n \n24 \nThis case also presents a good vehicle because the \ncourt of appeals\u2019 opinion is careful and scholarly. Pet. \nApp. 1a\u201348a. Even if one disagrees with its ultimate con-\nclusions, the opinion contains helpful and thoughtful dis-\ncussion that will assist the parties and this Court when \nthey argue and decide these issues. Finally, we are una-\nware of any other cases pending in the lower courts that \ninvolve the questions presented in this petition, so there \nare no other candidates or potential competitors that will \narise any time soon if the Court decides to pass on this \ncase.  \nIV. THE COURT SHOULD GRANT CERTIORARI \nEVEN \nTHOUGH \nIT \nSHOULD \nREJECT \nTHE \nSOLICITOR GENERAL\u2019S CRITICISMS OF THE \nCOURT OF APPEALS\u2019 OPINION \nThe Solicitor General spends much of her petition ar-\nguing that the court of appeals\u2019 decision is wrong and \nthat the Court should grant certiorari for that reason. \nPet. 13\u201327. None of this, however, affects the certworthi-\nness of the petition. The Court should grant certiorari \nregardless of whether it agrees with the court of appeals\u2019 \nanalysis because the lower courts pronounced an Act of \nCongress unconstitutional\u2014and that alone is sufficient \nto warrant certiorari when the case involves a federal \nstatute of this significance and magnitude. See supra, at \n19\u201320.  \nA petition-stage brief is not normally the place to de-\nbate the merits of the court of appeals\u2019 ruling. But the \nSolicitor General\u2019s attacks on the court of appeals\u2019 opin-\nion are unwarranted and should not go unanswered. We \nwill briefly rebut the Solicitor General\u2019s criticisms and \n\n \n \n \n25 \ndefend the court of appeals\u2019 holdings on the Appoint-\nments Clause and the remedial issues, which should be \naffirmed across the board if the Court decides to take up \nthis case.  \nA. The Court Of Appeals Correctly Held That The Task \nForce \nMembers \nAre \n\u201cPrincipal\u201d \nRather \nThan \n\u201cInferior\u201d Officers \nThe Solicitor General acknowledges that the Task \nForce members are \u201cofficers of the United States\u201d who \nmust be appointed in conformity with Article II. Pet. 14. \nBut she insists that the Task Force members are \u201cinferi-\nor officers,\u201d and that Congress may therefore vest their \nappointment in a \u201cHead of Department\u201d such as Secre-\ntary Becerra. See id. at 14\u201322. The court of appeals cor-\nrectly rejected this argument. \nAn \u201cinferior\u201d officer is an officer whose work is \u201cdi-\nrected and supervised at some level by others who were \nappointed by Presidential nomination with the advice \nand consent of the Senate.\u201d Edmond, 520 U.S. at 662\u201363; \nUnited States v. Arthrex, Inc., 594 U.S. 1, 13 (2021) \n(same). That direction and supervision is absent here. 42 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(1) empowers the Task Force\u2014and \nthe Task Force alone\u2014to determine the preventive care \nthat private insurers must cover. Neither Secretary \nBecerra, nor any other officer of the United States, has \nstatutory authority to countermand any preventive-care \nedict issued by the Task Force. Indeed, no other officer \ncan even influence the Task Force\u2019s decisions, as 42 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(6) provides that Task Force members \nand their recommendations \u201cshall be independent and, to \nthe extent practicable, not subject to political pressure.\u201d \n\n \n \n \n26 \nSee also 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(1) (requiring the Director \nof AHRQ to \u201cconvene an independent Preventive Ser-\nvices Task Force\u201d (emphasis added)). These statutory \nguarantees of independence preclude any officer of the \nUnited States from reviewing or reversing the Task \nForce\u2019s recommendations, and the absence of \u201cstatutory \nauthority\u201d to review Task Force decisions makes its \nmembers principal officers. See Arthrex, 594 U.S. at 15 \n(\u201cstatutory authority to review\u201d decisions is needed to \nmake one an inferior officer); id. at 19 (\u201c[A]dequate su-\npervision entails review of decisions issued by inferior \nofficers.\u201d). \nThe Solicitor General nonetheless insists that the \nTask Force is \u201cdirected and supervised\u201d by Secretary \nBecerra despite the guarantees of independence in sec-\ntions 299b-4(a)(1) and (a)(6). First, the Solicitor General \nobserves that Task Force members are removable at will \nby the Secretary, which (according to the Solicitor Gen-\neral) gives the Secretary all the powers of \u201cdirection\u201d \nand \u201csupervision\u201d needed to satisfy Edmond\u2019s test for \ninferior-officer status. Pet. at 14\u201318. Second, the Solicitor \nGeneral contends that the constitutional-avoidance canon \nrequires courts to interpret 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(6) in a \nmanner that gives the Secretary whatever supervisory \npowers he needs to make the Task Force members into \n\u201cinferior\u201d officers. Neither argument works.  \n1. An Officer Does Not Automatically Become An \n\u201cInferior\u201d Officer Whenever He Is Subject To At-\nWill Removal By A Principal Officer \nThis Court has never held that an officer is automati-\ncally deemed \u201cinferior\u201d whenever he is subject to at-will \n\n \n \n \n27 \nremoval by a principal officer. Instead, removability is \nmerely one factor to consider in deciding whether an of-\nficer falls on the \u201cprincipal\u201d or \u201cinferior\u201d side of the line. \nSee Edmond, 520 U.S. at 664\u201365 (designating military \njudges inferior officers because they were subject to ad-\nministrative oversight, were \u201cremov[able] . . . without \ncause,\u201d and had \u201cno power to render a final decision\u201d); \nMorrison v. Olson, 487 U.S. 654, 671\u201372 (1988) (an of-\nficer\u2019s removability is one of four factors in the inferior-\nofficer inquiry); Appointment and Removal of Federal \nReserve Bank Members of the Federal Open Market \nCommittee, 43 Op. O.L.C. ___, 2019 WL 11594453, at \n**9\u201310 (2019) (\u201cTo decide whether an officer has a supe-\nrior, the Supreme Court has considered whether the of-\nficer is subject to the policy direction of another official, \nwhether the officer can take \u2018final\u2019 action without the ap-\nproval of another officer, and whether an executive of-\nficer other than the President has the \u2018power to remove \n[the] officer[].\u2019\u201d (quoting Edmond, 520 U.S. at 664\u201365)). \nThe Task Force members are principal officers be-\ncause their preventive-care coverage decisions are not \nsubject to review or reversal by anyone else in the execu-\ntive branch\u2014and that remains the case regardless of \nwhether the Secretary can remove them at will. See Ed-\nmond, 520 U.S. at 665 (\u201cWhat is significant is that the \njudges of the Court of Criminal Appeals have no power \nto render a final decision on behalf of the United States \nunless permitted to do so by other Executive officers.\u201d). \nThe touchstone for inferior-officer status is whether the \nindividual is \u201cdirected and supervised\u201d by a principal of-\nficer, not whether he is subject to at-will removal. Id. at \n\n \n \n \n28 \n663; see also Arthrex, 594 U.S. at 13 (\u201cAn inferior officer \nmust be \u2018directed and supervised at some level by others \nwho were appointed by Presidential nomination with the \nadvice and consent of the Senate.\u2019 \u201d (quoting Edmond, \n520 U.S. at 663)). The Task Force members\u2014even if re-\nmovable at will\u2014would still have the \u201c \u2018power to render \na final decision on behalf of the United States\u2019 without \n. . . review by their nominal superior or any other princi-\npal officer in the Executive Branch.\u201d Arthrex, 594 U.S. at \n14 (quoting Edmond, 520 U.S. at 665)). At-will removal \nwould allow Secretary Becerra to fire Task Force mem-\nbers if he is unhappy with their performance, but it \nwould not empower him to overrule their recommenda-\ntions or direct their decisionmaking given the guarantee \nof independence in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(6). \n2. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(6) Cannot Be Interpreted To \nGive The Secretary Powers To \u201cDirect\u201d Or \n\u201cSupervise\u201d The Task Force Members Or Their \nRecommendations \nThe Solicitor General also urges this Court to inter-\npret 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(6) to give the Secretary just \nenough powers of \u201cdirection\u201d and \u201csupervision\u201d over the \nTask Force so that its members can be squeezed into the \n\u201cinferior officer\u201d cubbyhole. Pet. at 19\u201322. The Solicitor \nGeneral insists that the constitutional-avoidance canon \ncompels this construction, even though the statutory text \nrequires Task Force members and recommendations to \nremain \u201cindependent\u201d and \u201cto the extent practicable, not \nsubject to political pressure.\u201d There are two insur-\nmountable problems with the Solicitor General\u2019s argu-\nment.  \n\n \n \n \n29 \nFirst. The constitutional-avoidance canon is inappli-\ncable because the Solicitor General\u2019s proposed interpre-\ntation of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(6) will not avoid an Ap-\npointments Clause violation. Even if one adopts the So-\nlicitor General\u2019s construction of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(6) \nand gives the Secretary all of the powers needed to turn \nthe Task Force members into \u201cinferior officers,\u201d the Task \nForce still has not been constitutionally appointed be-\ncause it members were tapped by the Director of AHRQ, \nwho is not a \u201cHead of Department.\u201d The government \nrecognizes this problem and is trying to fix it by having \nthe Secretary re-appoint the Task Force.23 But Congress \nhas not \u201cvested\u201d Secretary Becerra with appointment \nauthority over the Task Force, as required by Article II. \nAnd even if Congress had \u201cvested\u201d this appointment \npower in the Secretary, the past coverage recommenda-\ntions of the Task Force still cannot be implemented be-\ncause its members were unconstitutionally appointed \nwhen those recommendations were made. See Lucia v. \nSEC, 585 U.S. 237, 251\u201352 (2018); Ryder v. United \nStates, 515 U.S 177, 182\u201383 (1995). The statutes govern-\ning the Task Force and its coverage mandates violate the \nAppointments Clause no matter how 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-\n4(a)(6) is construed\u2014and regardless of whether the \nTask Force members are pigeonholed as \u201cprincipal\u201d or \n\u201cinferior\u201d officers. \nSecond. The language of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(6) is \nnot \u201creadily susceptible\u201d to the Solicitor General\u2019s inter-\npretation. See United States v. Stevens, 559 U.S. 460, 481 \n \n23. See note 8 and accompanying test. \n\n \n \n \n30 \n(2010) (\u201c[T]his Court may impose a limiting construction \non a statute only if it is readily susceptible to such a con-\nstruction. We will not rewrite a . . . law to conform it to \nconstitutional requirements, for doing so would consti-\ntute a serious invasion of the legislative domain\u201d (cita-\ntions and internal quotation marks omitted)); Seila Law \nLLC v. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, 591 \nU.S. 197, 230 (2020) (\u201cConstitutional avoidance is not a \nlicense to rewrite Congress\u2019s work to say whatever the \nConstitution needs it to say in a given situation.\u201d). Con-\nsider the text of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(6): \nAll members of the Task Force convened under \nthis subsection, and any recommendations \nmade by such members, shall be independent \nand, to the extent practicable, not subject to \npolitical pressure. \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(6). The idea that the Secretary can \n\u201cdirect\u201d and \u201csupervise\u201d the Task Force members is in-\ncompatible with the statutory guarantees of \u201cindepend-\nence\u201d and immunity from \u201cpolitical pressure.\u201d The Solici-\ntor General acknowledges that the requirement of \u201cin-\ndependence\u201d means that the Task Force members must \nuse \u201ctheir own best judgment,\u201d and that its recommen-\ndations may \u201cnot be influenced by outside pressures.\u201d \nPet. at 19. But that means that the Secretary cannot \u201cdi-\nrect\u201d the Task Force, because if he did then the Task \nForce members would no longer be using \u201ctheir own best \njudgment\u201d and would \u201cbe influenced by outside pres-\nsures.\u201d And that means that the Task Force members fail \nthe Edmond test for inferior-officer status, even under \nthe Solicitor General\u2019s proposed interpretation of \u201cinde-\n\n \n \n \n31 \npendent,\u201d because their work is not \u201cdirected and super-\nvised at some level by others who were appointed by \nPresidential nomination with the advice and consent of \nthe Senate.\u201d Edmond, 520 U.S. at 662\u201363.24 \nThe Solicitor General also claims that the phrase \u201cto \nthe extent practicable\u201d should be interpreted to mean \u201cto \nthe extent constitutional.\u201d Pet. 20\u201321. But this qualifier \nattaches only to the requirement that Task Force mem-\nbers be shielded from \u201cpolitical pressure.\u201d The command \nthat Task Force members and recommendations \u201cshall \nbe independent\u201d is absolute, and there is no statutory \nlanguage that gives the Secretary wiggle room to com-\npromise the independence required by 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-\n4(a)(6) and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(1). The Solicitor Gen-\neral does not explain how the Task Force members (and \ntheir recommendations) can simultaneously be \u201cinde-\npendent\u201d yet subject to the \u201cdirection\u201d of the Secretary. \nDoes anyone think the Federal Reserve would remain \n\u201cindependent\u201d (under any understanding of that word) if \nthe president or the Secretary of the Treasury could \u201cdi-\nrect\u201d its interest-rate decisions? \n \n24. The Solicitor General is careful to claim only that her interpre-\ntation of the word \u201cindependent\u201d allows for secretarial \u201csupervi-\nsion\u201d of the Task Force\u2014and not secretarial \u201cdirection\u201d of its \ndecisions. Pet. at 19\u201320 (\u201c[T]he reference to \u2018independence\u2019 is \nmost naturally read to require the Task Force members to \nmake \u201cunbiased, independent judgments,\u201d even while subject to \nsecretarial supervision with respect to their conduct and the ef-\nfect of their recommendations.\u201d (emphasis added)).  \n\n \n \n \n32 \nB. The Court Of Appeals Correctly Refused To Remedy \nThe Appointments Clause Violations By \u201cSevering\u201d \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(6) \nThe Solicitor General insists that the district court \nshould have remedied the Appointments Clause viola-\ntions by \u201csevering\u201d the statutory provision that guaran-\ntees the independence of the Task Force and prohibits \npolitical interference with its recommendations, thereby \nallowing the Secretary to direct and supervise the Task \nForce and its preventive-care coverage recommenda-\ntions. Pet. at 22\u201327. This remedy is unlawful for many \nreasons. \nThe first problem is that a regime in which the Secre-\ntary is permitted to countermand the \u201cA\u201d or \u201cB\u201d recom-\nmendations of the Task Force still violates the Appoint-\nments Clause. The Solicitor General\u2019s proposed remedy \nwould allow the Secretary to overrule the Task Force\u2019s \n\u201cA\u201d and \u201cB\u201d recommendations but not its failure to rec-\nommend coverage of items or services under 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 300gg-13(a)(1). See Pet. at 24 (\u201cThe court therefore \nshould have severed Section 299b-4(a)(6)\u2019s application to \nTask Force \u2018A\u2019 and \u2018B\u2019 recommendations, thus giving the \nSecretary \u2018authority to provide for a means of reviewing\u2019 \nthose recommendations.\u201d). This would create a regime in \nwhich both the Secretary and the Task Force have gate-\nkeeping functions in deciding which preventive care the \nprivate insurers must cover. But that means the Task \nForce will still wield \u201csignificant authority pursuant to \nthe laws of the United States,\u201d25 because preventive-care \n \n25. Buckley, 424 U.S. at 126. \n\n \n \n \n33 \ncoverage mandates cannot and will not take effect under \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(1) without its recommendation \nand approval.26 And it does not make the Task Force \nmembers into \u201cinferior officers,\u201d because no principal \nofficer has any ability to review or countermand their \ndecisions not to adopt an \u201cA\u201d or \u201cB\u201d recommendation. \nSee Arthrex, 594 U.S. at 14\u201315. Moreover, even if the de-\nfendants\u2019 proposed remedy converted the Task Force \nmembers into \u201cinferior officers,\u201d their appointments \nwould still violate the Constitution because Congress has \nnot opted out of the default method of appointment in \nArticle II. \nThere is a more serious problem with the Solicitor \nGeneral\u2019s proposed remedy: A federal court has no pow-\ner to cancel the statutory provision in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-\n4(a)(6) or confer powers on a cabinet secretary that Con-\ngress has explicitly withheld. A federal district court\u2019s \nremedial tools extend to declaratory judgments, injunc-\ntions, APA remedies, and writs\u2014and these remedies are \nlimited by statute and historical practice. See Whole \nWoman\u2019s Health v. Jackson, 595 U.S. 30, 44 (2021). The \nSolicitor General does not explain how her proposed \nremedy fits into any of these categories, or how the dis-\ntrict-court judgment that must be entered on remand \nwill be able to implement her proposed remedy. \n \n26. The Solicitor General appears to acknowledge that her proposed \nremedy would not strip Task Force members of their status as \n\u201cofficers.\u201d See Appellants\u2019 Br. at 38 (describing the Task Force \nmembers as \u201cinferior officers\u201d). \n\n \n \n \n34 \nThe final problem with the Solicitor General\u2019s reme-\ndy is that it will not redress the plaintiffs\u2019 Article III in-\njuries, which are caused by the Secretary\u2019s enforcement \nof the preventive-care mandates, not by his failure to re-\nview or ratify them. A remedy that fails to redress the \nplaintiffs\u2019 injuries is incompatible with Article III. See \nSteel Co. v. Citizens for a Better Environment, 523 U.S. \n83, 107 (1998) (\u201cRelief that does not remedy the injury \nsuffered cannot bootstrap a plaintiff into federal court.\u201d). \n \n* * * \nThe Court should nonetheless grant certiorari be-\ncause the court of appeals\u2019 opinion, though well-reasoned \nand correct, declared an Act of Congress unconstitution-\nal (at least in part) and enjoined its enforcement against \nthe named plaintiffs. The Court typically grants certio-\nrari when a court of appeals disapproves a federal stat-\nute on constitutional grounds, and there is no reason not \nto do so here. \nCONCLUSION \nThe petition for writ of certiorari should be granted. \nRespectfully submitted. \n \nGENE P.

R. Civ. P. \n58(a). \nThis action came on for consideration by the Court, \nand the issues having been duly considered and a deci-\nsion duly rendered in the Court\u2019s orders partially grant-\ning and partially denying the parties\u2019 motions for sum-\nmary judgment. \nIt is therefore ORDERED, ADJUDGED, and \nDECREED that: \n\n 2a \n1)  All claims of Joel Miller and Gregory Scheideman \nin the above-entitled and numbered cause are \nhereby DISMISSED without prejudice for lack of \nsubject matter jurisdiction. \n \n2) The Advisory Committee on Immunization Prac-\ntices (ACIP) and the Health Resources and Ser-\nvices Administration (HRSA) do not, on the rec-\nord in this case, violate Article II\u2019s Appointments \nclause. Therefore, Braidwood Management Inc., \nKelley Orthodontics, John Kelley, Joel Starnes, \nZach Maxwell, and Ashley Maxwell\u2019s (remaining \nPlaintiffs) Claim No. 1 as it pertains to ACIP and \nHRSA is DISMISSED with prejudice to the re-\nfiling of same or any part thereof. \n \n3) The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force\u2019s \n(PSTF) recommendations operating in conjunc-\ntion with 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(1) violate Article \nII\u2019s Appointments Clause and are therefore un-\nlawful. Therefore, any and all agency actions tak-\nen to implement or enforce the preventive care \ncoverage requirements in response to an \u201cA\u201d or \n\u201cB\u201d recommendation by the PSTF on or after \nMarch 23, 2010 are VACATED and Defendants \nand their officers, agents, servants, and employ-\nees are ENJOINED from implementing or en-\nforcing 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(1)\u2019s compulsory \ncoverage requirements in response to an \u201cA\u201d or \n\u201cB\u201d rating from PSTF in the future. \n \n \nFurther, any and all agency action taken to im-\nplement or enforce the preventive care mandates \n\n 3a \nin response to an \u201cA\u201d or \u201cB\u201d recommendation by \nPSTF on or after March 23, 2010 and made com-\npulsory under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(1) are \nDECLARED unlawful as violative of the Ap-\npointments Clause. Therefore, Braidwood Man-\nagement Inc. and Kelley Orthodontics, and to the \nextent applicable, individual Plaintiffs need not \ncomply with the preventive care coverage recom-\nmendations of PSTF issued on or after March 23, \n2010, because the members of the Task Force \nhave not been appointed in a manner consistent \nwith Article II\u2019s Appointments Clause. According-\nly, the Court ENJOINS Defendants and their of-\nficers, agents, servants, and employees from im-\nplementing or enforcing the same against these \nPlaintiffs. \n \n4) 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(1)\u2013(a)(4) do not violate \nthe nondelegation doctrine. Therefore, remaining \nPlaintiffs\u2019 Claim No. 2 is DISMISSED with \nprejudice to the re-filing of same or any part \nthereof. \n \n5) The operation of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(1) does \nnot violate Article II\u2019s Vesting Clause. Therefore, \nremaining Plaintiffs\u2019 Claim No. 3 is DISMISSED \nwith prejudice to the re-filing of same or any \npart thereof. \n \n6)  Remaining \nPlaintiffs\u2019 \nClaim \nNo. \n4 \nis \nDISMISSED with prejudice to the re-filing of \nsame or any part thereof for failure to state a \nclaim upon which relief may be granted. \n\n 4a \n \n7)  The PrEP mandate violates remaining Plaintiffs\u2019 \nrights under the Religious Freedom Restoration \nAct and is therefore DECLARED unlawful. As \nsuch, remaining Plaintiffs need not comply with \nthe preventive care coverage recommendations of \nPSTF issued on or after March 23, 2010 and the \nCourt ENJOINS Defendants and their officers, \nagents, servants, and employees from implement-\ning or enforcing the PrEP mandate as against \nthese Plaintiffs. \n \n8)  All costs shall be paid by the party incurring the \nsame. \n \n9)  All relief not expressly granted herein is denied. \n \nThe Clerk of Court is DIRECTED to close the \nabove-captioned case. \n \nSO ORDERED on this 30th day of March, 2023. \n \n \n /s/ Reed O\u2019Connor  \n \n  \n   \nReed O\u2019Connor \nUNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE \n \n \n\n 5a \nAPPENDIX B \n \nThe Affordable Care Act\u2019s preventive services provision, \nSection 2713 of the Public Health Service Act, 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 300g-13(a)(1)\u2013(4), requires that group health plans and \nhealth insurance issuers provide coverage without cost-\nsharing for preventive services recommended by or con-\ntained in guidelines supported by the United States Pre-\nventive Services Task Force (USPSTF), the Advisory \nCommittee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), and the \nHealth Resources and Services Administration (HRSA). \nThrough this provision, Congress recognized the scien-\ntific expertise of these entities. Litigation has been \nbrought questioning the authority under which these en-\ntities have issued recommendations and guidelines for \npreventive services that the Affordable Care Act re-\nquires health plans and issuers to cover without cost-\nsharing. To resolve questions raised in litigation and out \nof an abundance of caution, for purposes of coverage un-\nder the statute, I ratify the below listed guidelines and \nrecommendations for the reasons relied on by the \nUSPSTF, ACIP and the Director of the Centers for Dis-\nease Control and Prevention (CDC Director), and the \nHRSA Administrator in their previously published deci-\nsions or analyses regarding the relevant recommenda-\ntions. This action is not intended to suggest any legal de-\nfect or infirmity in the authority of these entities to issue \npreventive service guidelines and recommendations. \n\u2022 Evidence-based clinical preventive services that \nhave in effect a rating of \u201cA\u201d or \u201cB\u201d in the rec-\nommendations of the USPSTF as of the date of \nthis ratification, with the exception of the 2016 \n\n 6a \nUSPSTF recommendation on screening for \nbreast cancer, set forth in Exhibit A, attached; \n\u2022 Immunizations that have in effect a recommenda-\ntion from ACIP and the CDC Director with re-\nspect to the individual involved as of the date of \nthis ratification, set forth in Exhibit B, attached; \n\u2022 With respect to infants, children, and adolescents, \nevidence-informed preventive care and screenings \nprovided for in the comprehensive guidelines sup-\nported by HRSA as of the date of this ratification, \nset forth in Exhibit C, attached; and \n\u2022 With respect to women, such additional preven-\ntive care and screenings as provided for in com-\nprehensive guidelines supported by HRSA for \npurposes of 42 U.S. Code \u00a7 300gg13(a) as of the \ndate of this ratification, set forth in Exhibit D, at-\ntached. \nPursuant to my authority as Secretary of Health and \nHuman Services, and based on my independent and con-\nsidered review of the actions and decisions listed above, I \nhereby affirm and ratify the above recommendations and \nguidelines. \n \n January 21, 2022 \n \nXavier Becerra \nDate",

It is built on two alternative theories for why the Task Force is constitutional:\n    1.  **Argument 1: Task Force Members as Inferior Officers:** The primary argument that members are inferior officers properly appointed because they are supervised by the HHS Secretary, as per *Edmond v. United States*.\n    2.  **Argument 2: Task Force Members Are Not \"Officers\" at All:** The alternative argument, introduced by an amicus brief, that members do not hold a federal \"office\" under the definition established in cases like *United States v. Germaine* and *Auffmordt v. Hedden*, and their work is primarily fact-finding rather than exercising \"significant authority\" under *Buckley v. Valeo*.\n*   **Severability Argument (Stable):** The government's remedial argument\u2014that if a violation is found, the Court should sever the Task Force's independence clause rather than invalidate the mandate, following the precedent in *United States v. Arthrex, Inc.*\u2014remains the key fallback position.\n*   **Central Uncertainty (Confirmed and Unchanged):** The observation explicitly confirms that my model's largest and most critical gap is the complete lack of information on the respondents' (Braidwood Management, et al.) arguments. My confidence in any prediction remains extremely low. The agent's internal reasoning validates that the highest priority is to discover:\n    *   The specific legal basis for the claim that Task Force members are **principal officers**.\n    *   The rebuttal to the amicus argument that members are **not officers at all**.\n    *   The argument against severability as the appropriate remedy.",
          "design_beliefs": "This observation, a reflection on a failed action and a plan for a new one, is highly valuable for refining my methodological beliefs. It demonstrates a crucial learning loop: acting, observing the result (even failure), diagnosing the cause, and refining the strategy.\n\n1.  **Source Prioritization (Stable):** Starting with foundational documents like the petition for certiorari remains a confirmed, effective heuristic.\n2.  **Problem Decomposition (Stable):** Analyzing the case based on the distinct legal questions presented continues to be a robust framework.\n3.  **Analogical Case Analysis (Stable):** Prioritizing precedents cited by the parties (*Edmond*, *Arthrex*, *Germaine*, *Buckley*) remains a cornerstone of efficient legal analysis.\n4.  **Staged Information Gathering (Validated and Refined):** The strategy of building one side of the case before seeking the other is validated. The agent's reasoning confirms this approach. This observation adds a crucial layer to the *execution* of this strategy.\n5.  **Identify the \"Escape Hatch\" (Stable):** The importance of the severability argument as a distinct remedial issue is a confirmed part of the methodology.\n6.  **Overarching Principle - Action Selection via Uncertainty Reduction (Confirmed):** The agent's explicit thought process, which prioritizes acquiring the respondents' arguments to fill the largest knowledge gap, strongly confirms this as the core strategic driver.\n7.  **Heuristic - Analyze Near-Misses and Unexpected Results (Confirmed):** The agent's reasoning begins by acknowledging the value derived from the unexpected amicus brief, reinforcing the importance of this recently developed heuristic.\n8.  **Source Evaluation - Amicus Briefs for Novel Arguments (Confirmed):** The agent's reflection on the value of the amicus brief confirms that these documents should be treated as potential sources of unique legal frameworks, not just supporting arguments.\n9.  **New Heuristic - Refine Search Queries with Precise Terminology and Filters (New):** This is the most significant new learning from this observation. The agent's diagnosis of the previous search failure has generated a concrete, tactical improvement for future information retrieval actions. This heuristic includes two components:\n    *   **Use Precise Legal Terminology:** Use the correct term of art for the specific procedural stage (e.g., \"brief of respondent\" for a merits-stage brief, not \"brief in opposition,\" which is more common at the certiorari stage). This increases the probability of retrieving the correct document.\n    *   **Use Metadata Filters for Substantive Content:** Employ filters (e.g., for a \"main\" document link) to distinguish primary substantive filings from procedural or ancillary ones (like certificates of service). This improves the signal-to-noise ratio of search results."

My understanding has shifted from a one-sided view to a comprehensive map of the central legal conflict.\n\n*   **Petitioner's Arguments (Stable):** My model of the U.S. Government's position remains unchanged. It is built on two alternative theories for why the Task Force is constitutional:\n    1.  **Argument 1: Task Force Members as Inferior Officers:** The primary argument that members are inferior officers properly appointed because they are supervised by the HHS Secretary, as per *Edmond v.

Valeo*.\n*   **Respondents' Arguments (New and Foundational):** I have now acquired the core of Braidwood Management's arguments, which directly counter the petitioner's theories.\n    1.  **Argument 1: Task Force Members as Principal Officers:** The respondents assert that the members are principal officers. The linchpin of their argument is the statutory independence clause, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(6), which states members \"shall be independent and, to the extent practicable, not subject to political pressure.\" They argue this provision legally prevents the HHS Secretary from exercising the \"direction and supervision\" that *Edmond v. United States* requires for an officer to be considered \"inferior.\"\n    2.  **Rebuttal to Removal Power Argument:** The respondents preemptively argue that even if the Secretary has at-will removal power, this alone is insufficient to establish inferior officer status, citing *Morrison v. Olson*. The dispositive factor, in their view, is the lack of supervision over the *substance* of the Task Force's work, which the statute forbids.\n    3.  **Rebuttal to \"Not an Officer\" Argument:** The respondents implicitly counter this by framing the Task Force's history. They concede that *before* the ACA, the Task Force was purely advisory and its members were not \"officers.\" However, they argue the ACA transformed their status by granting them \"significant authority\" to issue binding coverage mandates, thus making them \"officers of the United States\" who must be constitutionally appointed.\n*   **The Remedial Clash (Clarified and Sharpened):** The disagreement over the remedy is now clear.\n    *   **Petitioner's Position (Stable):** If a violation is found, the Court should sever the independence clause (\u00a7 299b-4(a)(6)) but preserve the coverage mandate, following the precedent in *United States v. Arthrex, Inc.*\n    *   **Respondents' Position (New):** The Court should *not* sever the independence clause. They argue that doing so would be an act of judicial legislation, not a remedy. It would transform the Task Force from the independent body Congress intended into a subordinate one, creating a regulatory scheme that Congress did not enact and fundamentally rewriting the statute.\n*   **Central Uncertainty (Shifted and Refined):** The primary uncertainty is no longer a lack of information but a question of judicial interpretation. The key questions are now:\n    1.  How will the Court interpret the *Edmond* \"supervision\" standard in light of a statute that explicitly mandates independence? Does the phrase \"to the extent practicable\" provide enough supervisory power to the Secretary to render the members \"inferior\"?\n    2.  Will the Court view severing the independence clause as a permissible *Arthrex*-style fix or as an impermissible judicial rewriting of a statute?",

This unusual alignment, where both parties want the Supreme Court to hear the case, signals the respondents' high confidence in their legal position and their desire for a final, definitive ruling. This teaches me to analyze the *strategic choices* reflected in procedural filings, as they can provide signals about a party's perceived strength and objectives, beyond the explicit legal arguments."

She filed an amicus brief\u00a0in support of Raymond Lucia in\u00a0Lucia v. Securities and Exchange Commission. Yesterday the Supreme Court ruled in Lucia v. SEC, evaluating whether the Securities and Exchange Commission had used improper methods to hire its administrative law judges. A fairly lopsided 7-2 margin of justices concluded that it had. Standing alone, Justice Stephen Breyer found that the SEC had committed a statutory violation by improperly delegating appointments authority to staff \u2014 similar to an argument previously raised by professor Jennifer Nou. Six of the remaining justices held that the SEC\u2019s staff-level appointments of ALJs constituted a constitutional violation. In an opinion written by Justice Elena Kagan, the court concluded that the SEC\u2019s ALJs are \u201cofficers of the United States\u201d who must be appointed by \u201cthe President, a court of law, or a head of department\u201d \u2014 not by staff. In addition to the somewhat surprising margin of decision in what at times seemed a controversial case, the Lucia litigation had several atypical twists along the way. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit had agreed to rehear the Lucia decision en banc even though the panel opinion was a straight-up application of D.C. Circuit precedent from 2000. Then the en banc court split 5-5, issuing just \u201ca per curiam order denying Lucia\u2019s claim.\u201d Finally, at the cert stage, the government changed its litigating position, agreeing with the petitioner that the ALJs are \u201cofficers.\u201d Further, the solicitor general asked the court to consider whether the ALJ\u2019s good-cause removal protections improperly restrict executive supervision. The SG\u2019s position appeared well-calculated yesterday. The seven-justice determination that the ALJ appointments were unlawful suggested that the SG\u2019s legal position was on solid ground. And although generally one thinks of the SG\u2019s role as to defend executive branch practices \u2014 such as an agency\u2019s staffing procedures \u2014 larger-scale issues of the integrity of executive power were at play. Ultimately the government\u2019s position defended the Article II prerogative of the executive to have either himself or his one-step-removed department head appoint executive officers. Further, Breyer\u2019s opinion agreed with the government that the constitutional removal and appointments questions were inextricably intertwined. Despite the intriguing posture of the case, in the end the majority opinion itself was modest. As prolific appointments clause scholar Kent Barnett has pointed out, the Lucia decision was about as narrow as it could be. Kagan\u2019s remarks at oral argument foreshadowed the outcome. In 1991, in Freytag v. Commissioner, the Supreme Court held that special trial judges who presided over certain Tax Court proceedings were Article II \u201cofficers.\u201d In an exchange with court-appointed amicus Anton Metlitsky at oral argument, Kagan said: \u201c[I]f you had a list and you said top 10 attributes of the judges that were involved in Freytag and the judges that are involved here, you\u2019d pretty much say that nine of them are the same and maybe one is different.\u201d The court\u2019s opinion consequently pointed out that the Freytag STJs \u201care near-carbon copies\u201d of the SEC\u2019s ALJs. Both sets of officers \u201ctake testimony,\u201d \u201c[r]eceiv[e] evidence and [e]xamine witnesses at hearings,\u201d \u201ctake pre-hearing depositions,\u201d \u201cconduct trials,\u201d \u201cadminister oaths, rule on motions,\u201d \u201cgenerally regulat[e] the course of a hearing,\u201d \u201crule on the admissibility of evidence,\u201d and \u201chave the power to . . . punish all [c]ontemptuous conduct\u201d \u2014 i.e., both may utilize \u201cnearly all the tools of federal trial judges.\u201d At the most basic level, then, Lucia is just a straightforward application of Freytag. But the Lucia opinion also brings some subtle changes to the court\u2019s formulation of the Article II \u201cofficer\u201d standard that may impact appointments clause cases in the lower courts. For starters, in the past, the D.C. Circuit in particular has read essentially every facet of Supreme Court appointments-clause discussion as establishing new mandatory \u201cofficer\u201d elements. In Freytag, the court discussed final decision-making authority in the alternative \u2014 and the D.C. Circuit concluded that only officials with such authority are \u201cofficers.\u201d The Freytag court mentioned discretionary authority and the handling of important issues as indicia of Article II \u201cofficer\u201d status\u2014 and the D.C. Circuit in Tucker v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue suggested that both of those factors \u2014 and final decision-making \u2014 are mandatory. In Lucia, the court indicated that this interpretive approach is incorrect. The court explicitly stated that it was not deciding whether each ALJ/STJ characteristic is constitutionally required \u201cfor someone conducting adversarial hearings to count as an officer.\u201d In other words, as Justices Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch expressed in their concurring opinion, the court\u2019s opinions have suggested that certain characteristics are sufficient, but perhaps not necessary, for Article II \u201cofficer\u201d status. Moving forward, if lower courts can identify that a particular official has responsibilities that are more significant than those of the SEC\u2019s ALJs, a court might fairly confidently rule that the official is an \u201cofficer.\u201d But for any position with duties non-analogous to agency adjudicators, or with duties arguably less weighty than the SEC\u2019s ALJs, there is an open question. Lower courts, and Congress when it creates new governmental positions, will have to use their best judgment to compare and contrast the position under consideration with officials previously determined to be \u201cofficers.\u201d But lower courts can no longer point to highly detailed factors from a particular Supreme Court appointments clause decision and necessarily contend that those factors have been mandated by the court. In continuity with Buckley v.Valeo, the court in Lucia remains committed to the amorphous \u201csignificant authority\u201d standard for \u201cofficer\u201d status, declining to flesh it out any more than just to clarify that the SEC\u2019s ALJs satisfy it under Freytag. The one curious addition that the Lucia opinion does emphasize, however, is the threshold qualification that only officials in \u201ccontinuing positions\u201d are \u201cofficers.\u201d The Lucia opinion suggests that this \u201ccontinuing position\u201d element \u2014 emphasized in United States v. Germaine in 1879 \u2014 was also embraced by the court in Freytag. But neither of the court\u2019s modern appointments clause decisions, in Buckley or Freytag, explicitly imposed the \u201ccontinuing\u201d officer requirement. And no litigant in Lucia contended that this element might be outcome-determinative. Perhaps the court highlighted the \u201ccontinuing position\u201d qualification for \u201cofficer\u201d status along with its discussion of \u201csignificant authority\u201d because the qualification plays a fairly prominent role in the Department of Justice\u2019s 2007 \u201cofficer\u201d definition, discussed in the SG\u2019s Lucia brief. Or, perhaps the court is trying to more closely tie the modern Buckley officer formulation to its 19th-century appointments clause cases. At one point the court in Free Enterprise Fund v. Public Company Accounting Oversight Board in 2010 suggested that language in Germaine indicates that the vast majority of civil servants are non-officers. But the 2010 opinion apparently misconstrued Germaine\u2018s discussion to apply to fulltime government employees, not just to individuals hired intermittently for services like government contractors or the civil surgeons at issue in Germaine. One final point about the Lucia opinions that merits discussion relates to Breyer\u2019s continued uneasiness about the impact of appointments clause jurisprudence on civil service tenure protections. Breyer indicates that he turned to statutory grounds in Lucia because he is deeply concerned that concluding that ALJs are Article II \u201cofficers\u201d may lead to the companion conclusion that ALJ tenure protections are barred under Free Enterprise Fund\u2018s prohibition on double for-cause removal protections for certain executive officers. Further, Breyer fears that applying Free Enterprise Fund to \u201chigh-level civil servants threatens to change the nature of our merit-based civil service as it has existed from the time of President Chester Alan Arthur.\u201d But this final concern appears to be based, at least in part, on factual imprecision. Arthur served during the 1883 enactment of the Pendleton Act, the first statute to establish a comprehensive merit-based civil service selection system. But that act had very little to do with the labyrinthine set of tenure protections applicable to civil servants today. The theory of an expert civil service at the time was based much more on selecting qualified officers on the front end. The Pendleton Act barred only removals motivated by retaliation related to political campaign activity. Even the Lloyd-La Follette Act\u2018s establishment of more generous removal protections in 1912 apparently was motivated by particular concerns related to whistleblowing-employee speech protections \u2014 not a generalized idea that federal employees must be insulated from removal to ensure an expert civil service. The court\u2019s apparently modest-at-least-for-now opinion in Lucia intentionally leaves several unanswered questions. Are the ALJs\u2019 tenure protections unconstitutionally restrictive? (The court needs thorough lower-court review before it would take this up.) Has the SEC properly ratified the previously improper ALJ appointments? (The court sees no reason to address this.) Is a \u201cnew officer \u2026 required for every Appointments Clause violation\u201d? (Not necessarily.) What exactly are the factors that give a government official sufficiently \u201csignificant authority\u201d to be an \u201cofficer\u201d? (You have it if the court has held previously that your position is an \u201coffice.\u201d) It\u2019s unclear how, or whether, courts will address these issues in the future. But it seems likely that appointments clause scholars and practitioners will be productively employed for at least a few more years.

Linkedin Facebook X Youtube Share What's NewNewsEventsPublicationsSubscribeMedia ContactBlogsFederal Policy Watch: Monitoring White House Developments Supreme Court Decides When Administrative Law Judges Must Have Constitutional AppointmentsNewsletter Share Share 7.26.2018Recently, in Lucia v. Securities and Exchange Comm\u2019n, 138 S. Ct. 2044 (2018), the Supreme Court decided when administrative law judges must be appointed under the terms of the Constitution. This ruling may affect the authority of similar judges in a wide variety of federal agencies. In Lucia, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) charged an investment company with violating securities laws and assigned an administrative law judge (ALJ) to decide the case. The ALJ found against the company and it appealed to the full SEC arguing that the ruling was invalid because ALJ had not been properly appointed under the Appointments Clause of Article II of the United States Constitution. The Appointments Clause requires \u201cOfficers of the United States\u201d to be appointed only by the President, \u201cCourts of Law,\u201d or \u201cHeads of Departments.\u201d But the ALJ in Lucia had been selected by SEC staff members, rather than the SEC itself. The SEC and an evenly-divided Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit rejected the company\u2019s argument, reasoning that ALJs are \u201cmere employees\u201d\u2014not \u201cOfficers of the United States\u201d under Appointments Clause. The Supreme Court reversed, holding that SEC ALJs are in fact \u201cOfficers of the United States,\u201d subject to the Appointments Clause. The Court explained the basic framework for distinguishing between officers and employees: employees are \u201coccasional or temporary,\u201d whereas officers are \u201ccontinuing and permanent,\u201d and officers \u201cexercise\u201d significant authority under the laws of the United States.\u201d This inquiry turns on whether an individual (1) holds a career appointment created by statute and (2) exercises significant judicial discretion similar to that of a federal trial judge. The Court held that the SEC\u2019s ALJs both hold a continuing office and exercise significant authority, including taking testimony, conducting trials, ruling on the admissibility of evidence, and enforcing compliance with discovery rules. In reaching this conclusion, the Court also relied on an earlier decision in which it held that similar administrative judges working for the Internal Revenue Service were also covered by the Appointments Clause. Because the ALJ did not have proper authority to decide the case, the Court reversed the decision against the investment company and returned the case to the SEC with directions that the case be decided by another ALJ who had been properly appointed or by the full SEC itself. The Open Question: How Does Lucia Affect Other Federal Agencies? The Lucia decision may reach well beyond just the SEC\u2019s ALJs. The same fundamental principles that guided the Court in Lucia\u2014whether ALJs\u2019 positions are \u201ccontinuing and permanent\u201d as created by statute and whether they exercise \u201csignificant authority\u201d akin to a federal trial judge\u2014may be applied equally to a variety of other federal agencies. In the wake of Lucia, the authority of other federal ALJs will likely be reexamined to determine if they too are \u201cOfficers of the United States\u201d under the Appointments Clause. E.

NCAA, the Court\u2019s severability doctrine \u201crequires judges to determine what Congress would have intended had it known that part of its statute was unconstitutional.\u201d \u00a0When applying this doctrine in cases concerning administrative agencies\u2019 authority, the Court appears insufficiently attentive to constitutional checks-and-balances concerns.\u00a0 The Court generally presumes that Congress would have preferred to preserve as much of a federal regulatory scheme as possible, rather than treating checks-and-balances concerns as fundamentally important to that scheme. \u00a0Over time, this systematically leads to unintended enhancement of the authority of the Executive Branch in general, and the President in particular.\u00a0 Due to the realities of the legislative process and the President\u2019s veto power, such continuing enlargement of executive authority cannot easily be reversed, regardless of Congress\u2019 actual policy preferences. INS v. Chadha is one of the most important examples of the Court\u2019s minimization of separation-of-powers concerns in conducting its severability analysis.\u00a0 Congress had enacted a law authorizing the Attorney General to not only suspend deportation of deportable aliens, but adjust their status to lawful permanent residents.\u00a0 The Attorney General was required to report such decisions to Congress.\u00a0 If either the House or the Senate enacted a resolution prior to the end of its next session disapproving the Attorney General\u2019s decision, then the government had to deport the alien. The Supreme Court held that this one-house legislative veto was unconstitutional.\u00a0 On the question of the proper remedy, Congress itself had argued to the Court that, \u201cif the provision for the one-House veto is held unconstitutional, all of [the challenged statute] must fall.\u201d\u00a0 In other words, Congress had conferred broad authority on the Attorney General to grant lawful permanent resident status with the understanding that each chamber of Congress would be able to oversee and reject exercises of that power.\u00a0 By invalidating that congressional check while leaving the underlying grant of discretion to the Attorney General in place, the Court enhanced the Executive Branch\u2019s authority at the expense of Congress. Pointing to the Immigration & Naturalization Act\u2019s (\u201cINA\u201d) severability provision, the Court held that the one-House legislative veto was severable.\u00a0 In reaching that conclusion, the Court did not seriously consider whether the enacting Congress actually would have granted the Attorney General authority to suspend deportations and grant lawful permanent resident status without the possibility of congressional nullification.\u00a0 Nor did it grapple with the checks-and-balances implications of allowing the Executive Branch to retain authority and discretion while removing congressional review of that power.\u00a0 By assuming that Congress would have wished to delegate the same authority to the Executive Branch even without the possibility of direct congressional review and constraint, the Court effectively placed no value on balance-of-power considerations. Rather than simply returning the legislative and executive branches to the status quo ex ante, the Court tilted the system sharply in favor of the executive branch.\u00a0 Thus, the President may be expected to wield the veto power to avoid losing such fortuitously enhanced authority, thereby preventing simple majorities in Congress from reasserting their will.\u00a0 Even putting aside the possibility of presidential veto, Congress\u2019 failure to amend the underlying law cannot be deemed an endorsement of, or acquiescence in, the Court\u2019s ruling. Rather, the vetogates strewn throughout the legislative process can prevent the adoption of policies that a majority of both chambers would support. Moreover, by leaving the underlying provisions governing the suspension-of-deportation process in place, the Court reduced the issue\u2019s urgency.\u00a0 In the absence of executive pressure, a powerful outside lobby, or other major external impetus, it can be difficult for even popular measures to make it onto Congress\u2019 agenda and through the legislative process. Invalidating the entire suspension-of-deportation provision\u2014or potentially an even broader segment of the INA\u2014would have provoked legislative action, inducing Congress to adopt a replacement scheme that actually reflected its will and struck an appropriate balance of power between the branches. Considered on its own, Chadha might be dismissed as dealing with a narrow issue that doesn\u2019t materially impact the relative authority of the legislative and executive branches.\u00a0 Congress had adopted hundreds of legislative veto provisions, however, appending them to a wide variety of delegations of authority to executive agencies.\u00a0 For example, when Congress deregulated the airline industry, it established an Employee Protection Program (\u201cEPP\u201d) to mitigate the impact on airline personnel.\u00a0 The statute granted the Secretary of Labor broad authority to promulgate regulations to implement the EPP, subject to a one-House legislative veto.\u00a0 In Alaska Airlines, Inc. v. Brock, the Court applied Chadha to conclude that Congress still would have delegated the same authority to the Secretary, even without the legislative veto.\u00a0 For any individual statute, considered in isolation, such an analysis may be persuasive.\u00a0 But if one considers the full range of laws subject to legislative veto provisions collectively\u2014an analysis our constitutional litigation process does not facilitate\u2014it is difficult to believe that Congress would have intended to materially alter the balance of power between the legislative and executive branches by conferring that same broad sweep of authority without the accompanying statutory checks. More recently, the Court has been applying severability analysis to bring previously independent or otherwise insulated officials and entities more firmly within the control of the President and other Executive Branch officials.\u00a0 Here too, the Court\u2019s presumption is that Congress would have granted the same authority and discretion to a government official or entity, even if it knew that the official or entity would be subject to greater executive oversight and control.\u00a0 Such reasoning appears to apply little value to constitutional checks-and-balances concerns, facilitating the aggregation of executive authority.\u00a0 Again, for any individual case, that reasoning may be persuasive.\u00a0 Collectively assessing the broad swath of restrictions on officers\u2019 removal that Congress has adopted which are likely subject to invalidation, however, the Court\u2019s assumption of congressional indifference to executive power may appear quite different. In Seila Law LLC v. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, for example, the Court held that it was unconstitutional for Congress to create an independent agency, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (\u201cCFPB\u201d), headed by a single officer who could be removed by the President only \u201cfor cause\u201d (meaning \u201cinefficiency, neglect, or malfeasance\u201d).\u00a0 Congress had established the CFPB through the Dodd-Frank Act as an independent agency.\u00a0 It had a half-billion dollar budget, \u201cpotent enforcement powers\u201d over more than 18 federal consumer protection laws, and \u201cextensive adjudicatory authority.\u201d\u00a0 The Court explained that, \u201c[s]ince its inception, the CFPB has obtained over $11 billion in relief for over 25 million customers.\u201d\u00a0 It concluded that, since the agency wielded tremendous executive authority and did not fall into any historical exceptions to the President\u2019s removal power, the Director\u2019s protection from at-will removal was unconstitutional. The Court then turned to the question of the proper remedy.\u00a0 It declared, \u201cWe think it clear that Congress would prefer that we use a scalpel rather than a bulldozer in curing the constitutional defect we identify today.\u201d \u00a0Citing the Dodd-Frank Act\u2019s severability clause, the Court held, \u201c[T]here is nothing in the text or history of the Dodd-Frank Act that demonstrates Congress would have preferred no CFPB to a CFPB supervised by the President.\u201d\u00a0 With the stroke of a pen, the Court created a new executive agency with its head removable at will by the President.\u00a0 In the name of judicial minimalism and deference to Congress, the Court enhanced the President\u2019s authority. The fact that Congress established the CFPB as an independent agency strongly suggests that it did not wish to lodge such substantial authority directly in the President without restriction.\u00a0 Of course, Congress\u2019 establishment of the CFPB in the first place also demonstrates that it saw the need to enhance consumer protections.\u00a0 The Court\u2019s severability analysis places much greater weight on the need to address the immediate tangible policy problems before Congress than the more abstract, overarching checks-and-balances concern about aggrandizing executive authority.\u00a0 Its ruling tilts the status quo in favor of the Executive, which can both lobby against and veto any effort to reduce this windfall of power.\u00a0 And by allowing the CFPB\u2019s day-to-day operations to continue unabated, the Court also substantially reduces any pressure on Congress to amend the Dodd-Frank Act to determine exactly how much authority it wishes to delegate to the President. The underlying problem with the Court\u2019s severability analysis is that it frames severability questions as a false binary.\u00a0 The Court considers only whether Congress would have preferred either: (i)\u00a0adopting the statute at issue without the unconstitutional provision, or (ii) rejecting the entire statutory scheme.\u00a0 In most cases, neither option is the most likely reflection of reality.\u00a0 When a statutory provision is unconstitutional, Congress typically would have wanted to adopt the underlying statutory scheme, but with modifications or offsets to limit the Executive Branch\u2019s authority.\u00a0 The Court, however, has no way to identify or impose the hypothetical counterfactual statute that Congress would have enacted, had it been prevented from including the constitutional infirmity in its legislation. By allowing modified grants of authority to the President or executive branch more broadly to remain in effect without the limits on executive power that Congress adopted, the Court creates a new statutory reality that Congress never endorsed in which it is much harder for Congress to adopt its actually-preferred alternative. \u00a0And the Court\u2019s approach to these severability issues tends to result in the continuous expansion and aggrandizement of executive authority and discretion.\u00a0 At a minimum, courts should be more attentive to these checks-and-balances concerns when performing a severability analysis.\u00a0 When assessing Congress\u2019 preferences in the course of a severability analysis, the Court should consider Congress\u2019 hypothetical intent not only with regard to the statute immediately before it, but also at a higher level of generality, concerning grants of authority of that type more broadly.

She filed an amicus brief\u00a0in support of Raymond Lucia in\u00a0Lucia v. Securities and Exchange Commission. Yesterday the Supreme Court ruled in Lucia v. SEC, evaluating whether the Securities and Exchange Commission had used improper methods to hire its administrative law judges. A fairly lopsided 7-2 margin of justices concluded that it had. Standing alone, Justice Stephen Breyer found that the SEC had committed a statutory violation by improperly delegating appointments authority to staff \u2014 similar to an argument previously raised by professor Jennifer Nou. Six of the remaining justices held that the SEC\u2019s staff-level appointments of ALJs constituted a constitutional violation. In an opinion written by Justice Elena Kagan, the court concluded that the SEC\u2019s ALJs are \u201cofficers of the United States\u201d who must be appointed by \u201cthe President, a court of law, or a head of department\u201d \u2014 not by staff. In addition to the somewhat surprising margin of decision in what at times seemed a controversial case, the Lucia litigation had several atypical twists along the way. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit had agreed to rehear the Lucia decision en banc even though the panel opinion was a straight-up application of D.C. Circuit precedent from 2000. Then the en banc court split 5-5, issuing just \u201ca per curiam order denying Lucia\u2019s claim.\u201d Finally, at the cert stage, the government changed its litigating position, agreeing with the petitioner that the ALJs are \u201cofficers.\u201d Further, the solicitor general asked the court to consider whether the ALJ\u2019s good-cause removal protections improperly restrict executive supervision. The SG\u2019s position appeared well-calculated yesterday. The seven-justice determination that the ALJ appointments were unlawful suggested that the SG\u2019s legal position was on solid ground. And although generally one thinks of the SG\u2019s role as to defend executive branch practices \u2014 such as an agency\u2019s staffing procedures \u2014 larger-scale issues of the integrity of executive power were at play. Ultimately the government\u2019s position defended the Article II prerogative of the executive to have either himself or his one-step-removed department head appoint executive officers. Further, Breyer\u2019s opinion agreed with the government that the constitutional removal and appointments questions were inextricably intertwined. Despite the intriguing posture of the case, in the end the majority opinion itself was modest. As prolific appointments clause scholar Kent Barnett has pointed out, the Lucia decision was about as narrow as it could be. Kagan\u2019s remarks at oral argument foreshadowed the outcome. In 1991, in Freytag v. Commissioner, the Supreme Court held that special trial judges who presided over certain Tax Court proceedings were Article II \u201cofficers.\u201d In an exchange with court-appointed amicus Anton Metlitsky at oral argument, Kagan said: \u201c[I]f you had a list and you said top 10 attributes of the judges that were involved in Freytag and the judges that are involved here, you\u2019d pretty much say that nine of them are the same and maybe one is different.\u201d The court\u2019s opinion consequently pointed out that the Freytag STJs \u201care near-carbon copies\u201d of the SEC\u2019s ALJs. Both sets of officers \u201ctake testimony,\u201d \u201c[r]eceiv[e] evidence and [e]xamine witnesses at hearings,\u201d \u201ctake pre-hearing depositions,\u201d \u201cconduct trials,\u201d \u201cadminister oaths, rule on motions,\u201d \u201cgenerally regulat[e] the course of a hearing,\u201d \u201crule on the admissibility of evidence,\u201d and \u201chave the power to . . . punish all [c]ontemptuous conduct\u201d \u2014 i.e., both may utilize \u201cnearly all the tools of federal trial judges.\u201d At the most basic level, then, Lucia is just a straightforward application of Freytag. But the Lucia opinion also brings some subtle changes to the court\u2019s formulation of the Article II \u201cofficer\u201d standard that may impact appointments clause cases in the lower courts. For starters, in the past, the D.C. Circuit in particular has read essentially every facet of Supreme Court appointments-clause discussion as establishing new mandatory \u201cofficer\u201d elements. In Freytag, the court discussed final decision-making authority in the alternative \u2014 and the D.C. Circuit concluded that only officials with such authority are \u201cofficers.\u201d The Freytag court mentioned discretionary authority and the handling of important issues as indicia of Article II \u201cofficer\u201d status\u2014 and the D.C. Circuit in Tucker v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue suggested that both of those factors \u2014 and final decision-making \u2014 are mandatory. In Lucia, the court indicated that this interpretive approach is incorrect. The court explicitly stated that it was not deciding whether each ALJ/STJ characteristic is constitutionally required \u201cfor someone conducting adversarial hearings to count as an officer.\u201d In other words, as Justices Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch expressed in their concurring opinion, the court\u2019s opinions have suggested that certain characteristics are sufficient, but perhaps not necessary, for Article II \u201cofficer\u201d status. Moving forward, if lower courts can identify that a particular official has responsibilities that are more significant than those of the SEC\u2019s ALJs, a court might fairly confidently rule that the official is an \u201cofficer.\u201d But for any position with duties non-analogous to agency adjudicators, or with duties arguably less weighty than the SEC\u2019s ALJs, there is an open question. Lower courts, and Congress when it creates new governmental positions, will have to use their best judgment to compare and contrast the position under consideration with officials previously determined to be \u201cofficers.\u201d But lower courts can no longer point to highly detailed factors from a particular Supreme Court appointments clause decision and necessarily contend that those factors have been mandated by the court. In continuity with Buckley v.Valeo, the court in Lucia remains committed to the amorphous \u201csignificant authority\u201d standard for \u201cofficer\u201d status, declining to flesh it out any more than just to clarify that the SEC\u2019s ALJs satisfy it under Freytag. The one curious addition that the Lucia opinion does emphasize, however, is the threshold qualification that only officials in \u201ccontinuing positions\u201d are \u201cofficers.\u201d The Lucia opinion suggests that this \u201ccontinuing position\u201d element \u2014 emphasized in United States v. Germaine in 1879 \u2014 was also embraced by the court in Freytag. But neither of the court\u2019s modern appointments clause decisions, in Buckley or Freytag, explicitly imposed the \u201ccontinuing\u201d officer requirement. And no litigant in Lucia contended that this element might be outcome-determinative. Perhaps the court highlighted the \u201ccontinuing position\u201d qualification for \u201cofficer\u201d status along with its discussion of \u201csignificant authority\u201d because the qualification plays a fairly prominent role in the Department of Justice\u2019s 2007 \u201cofficer\u201d definition, discussed in the SG\u2019s Lucia brief. Or, perhaps the court is trying to more closely tie the modern Buckley officer formulation to its 19th-century appointments clause cases. At one point the court in Free Enterprise Fund v. Public Company Accounting Oversight Board in 2010 suggested that language in Germaine indicates that the vast majority of civil servants are non-officers. But the 2010 opinion apparently misconstrued Germaine\u2018s discussion to apply to fulltime government employees, not just to individuals hired intermittently for services like government contractors or the civil surgeons at issue in Germaine. One final point about the Lucia opinions that merits discussion relates to Breyer\u2019s continued uneasiness about the impact of appointments clause jurisprudence on civil service tenure protections. Breyer indicates that he turned to statutory grounds in Lucia because he is deeply concerned that concluding that ALJs are Article II \u201cofficers\u201d may lead to the companion conclusion that ALJ tenure protections are barred under Free Enterprise Fund\u2018s prohibition on double for-cause removal protections for certain executive officers. Further, Breyer fears that applying Free Enterprise Fund to \u201chigh-level civil servants threatens to change the nature of our merit-based civil service as it has existed from the time of President Chester Alan Arthur.\u201d But this final concern appears to be based, at least in part, on factual imprecision. Arthur served during the 1883 enactment of the Pendleton Act, the first statute to establish a comprehensive merit-based civil service selection system. But that act had very little to do with the labyrinthine set of tenure protections applicable to civil servants today. The theory of an expert civil service at the time was based much more on selecting qualified officers on the front end. The Pendleton Act barred only removals motivated by retaliation related to political campaign activity. Even the Lloyd-La Follette Act\u2018s establishment of more generous removal protections in 1912 apparently was motivated by particular concerns related to whistleblowing-employee speech protections \u2014 not a generalized idea that federal employees must be insulated from removal to ensure an expert civil service. The court\u2019s apparently modest-at-least-for-now opinion in Lucia intentionally leaves several unanswered questions. Are the ALJs\u2019 tenure protections unconstitutionally restrictive? (The court needs thorough lower-court review before it would take this up.) Has the SEC properly ratified the previously improper ALJ appointments? (The court sees no reason to address this.) Is a \u201cnew officer \u2026 required for every Appointments Clause violation\u201d? (Not necessarily.) What exactly are the factors that give a government official sufficiently \u201csignificant authority\u201d to be an \u201cofficer\u201d? (You have it if the court has held previously that your position is an \u201coffice.\u201d) It\u2019s unclear how, or whether, courts will address these issues in the future. But it seems likely that appointments clause scholars and practitioners will be productively employed for at least a few more years.

Linkedin Facebook X Youtube Share What's NewNewsEventsPublicationsSubscribeMedia ContactBlogsFederal Policy Watch: Monitoring White House Developments Supreme Court Decides When Administrative Law Judges Must Have Constitutional AppointmentsNewsletter Share Share 7.26.2018Recently, in Lucia v. Securities and Exchange Comm\u2019n, 138 S. Ct. 2044 (2018), the Supreme Court decided when administrative law judges must be appointed under the terms of the Constitution. This ruling may affect the authority of similar judges in a wide variety of federal agencies. In Lucia, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) charged an investment company with violating securities laws and assigned an administrative law judge (ALJ) to decide the case. The ALJ found against the company and it appealed to the full SEC arguing that the ruling was invalid because ALJ had not been properly appointed under the Appointments Clause of Article II of the United States Constitution. The Appointments Clause requires \u201cOfficers of the United States\u201d to be appointed only by the President, \u201cCourts of Law,\u201d or \u201cHeads of Departments.\u201d But the ALJ in Lucia had been selected by SEC staff members, rather than the SEC itself. The SEC and an evenly-divided Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit rejected the company\u2019s argument, reasoning that ALJs are \u201cmere employees\u201d\u2014not \u201cOfficers of the United States\u201d under Appointments Clause. The Supreme Court reversed, holding that SEC ALJs are in fact \u201cOfficers of the United States,\u201d subject to the Appointments Clause. The Court explained the basic framework for distinguishing between officers and employees: employees are \u201coccasional or temporary,\u201d whereas officers are \u201ccontinuing and permanent,\u201d and officers \u201cexercise\u201d significant authority under the laws of the United States.\u201d This inquiry turns on whether an individual (1) holds a career appointment created by statute and (2) exercises significant judicial discretion similar to that of a federal trial judge. The Court held that the SEC\u2019s ALJs both hold a continuing office and exercise significant authority, including taking testimony, conducting trials, ruling on the admissibility of evidence, and enforcing compliance with discovery rules. In reaching this conclusion, the Court also relied on an earlier decision in which it held that similar administrative judges working for the Internal Revenue Service were also covered by the Appointments Clause. Because the ALJ did not have proper authority to decide the case, the Court reversed the decision against the investment company and returned the case to the SEC with directions that the case be decided by another ALJ who had been properly appointed or by the full SEC itself. The Open Question: How Does Lucia Affect Other Federal Agencies? The Lucia decision may reach well beyond just the SEC\u2019s ALJs. The same fundamental principles that guided the Court in Lucia\u2014whether ALJs\u2019 positions are \u201ccontinuing and permanent\u201d as created by statute and whether they exercise \u201csignificant authority\u201d akin to a federal trial judge\u2014may be applied equally to a variety of other federal agencies. In the wake of Lucia, the authority of other federal ALJs will likely be reexamined to determine if they too are \u201cOfficers of the United States\u201d under the Appointments Clause. E.

NCAA, the Court\u2019s severability doctrine \u201crequires judges to determine what Congress would have intended had it known that part of its statute was unconstitutional.\u201d \u00a0When applying this doctrine in cases concerning administrative agencies\u2019 authority, the Court appears insufficiently attentive to constitutional checks-and-balances concerns.\u00a0 The Court generally presumes that Congress would have preferred to preserve as much of a federal regulatory scheme as possible, rather than treating checks-and-balances concerns as fundamentally important to that scheme. \u00a0Over time, this systematically leads to unintended enhancement of the authority of the Executive Branch in general, and the President in particular.\u00a0 Due to the realities of the legislative process and the President\u2019s veto power, such continuing enlargement of executive authority cannot easily be reversed, regardless of Congress\u2019 actual policy preferences. INS v. Chadha is one of the most important examples of the Court\u2019s minimization of separation-of-powers concerns in conducting its severability analysis.\u00a0 Congress had enacted a law authorizing the Attorney General to not only suspend deportation of deportable aliens, but adjust their status to lawful permanent residents.\u00a0 The Attorney General was required to report such decisions to Congress.\u00a0 If either the House or the Senate enacted a resolution prior to the end of its next session disapproving the Attorney General\u2019s decision, then the government had to deport the alien. The Supreme Court held that this one-house legislative veto was unconstitutional.\u00a0 On the question of the proper remedy, Congress itself had argued to the Court that, \u201cif the provision for the one-House veto is held unconstitutional, all of [the challenged statute] must fall.\u201d\u00a0 In other words, Congress had conferred broad authority on the Attorney General to grant lawful permanent resident status with the understanding that each chamber of Congress would be able to oversee and reject exercises of that power.\u00a0 By invalidating that congressional check while leaving the underlying grant of discretion to the Attorney General in place, the Court enhanced the Executive Branch\u2019s authority at the expense of Congress. Pointing to the Immigration & Naturalization Act\u2019s (\u201cINA\u201d) severability provision, the Court held that the one-House legislative veto was severable.\u00a0 In reaching that conclusion, the Court did not seriously consider whether the enacting Congress actually would have granted the Attorney General authority to suspend deportations and grant lawful permanent resident status without the possibility of congressional nullification.\u00a0 Nor did it grapple with the checks-and-balances implications of allowing the Executive Branch to retain authority and discretion while removing congressional review of that power.\u00a0 By assuming that Congress would have wished to delegate the same authority to the Executive Branch even without the possibility of direct congressional review and constraint, the Court effectively placed no value on balance-of-power considerations. Rather than simply returning the legislative and executive branches to the status quo ex ante, the Court tilted the system sharply in favor of the executive branch.\u00a0 Thus, the President may be expected to wield the veto power to avoid losing such fortuitously enhanced authority, thereby preventing simple majorities in Congress from reasserting their will.\u00a0 Even putting aside the possibility of presidential veto, Congress\u2019 failure to amend the underlying law cannot be deemed an endorsement of, or acquiescence in, the Court\u2019s ruling. Rather, the vetogates strewn throughout the legislative process can prevent the adoption of policies that a majority of both chambers would support. Moreover, by leaving the underlying provisions governing the suspension-of-deportation process in place, the Court reduced the issue\u2019s urgency.\u00a0 In the absence of executive pressure, a powerful outside lobby, or other major external impetus, it can be difficult for even popular measures to make it onto Congress\u2019 agenda and through the legislative process. Invalidating the entire suspension-of-deportation provision\u2014or potentially an even broader segment of the INA\u2014would have provoked legislative action, inducing Congress to adopt a replacement scheme that actually reflected its will and struck an appropriate balance of power between the branches. Considered on its own, Chadha might be dismissed as dealing with a narrow issue that doesn\u2019t materially impact the relative authority of the legislative and executive branches.\u00a0 Congress had adopted hundreds of legislative veto provisions, however, appending them to a wide variety of delegations of authority to executive agencies.\u00a0 For example, when Congress deregulated the airline industry, it established an Employee Protection Program (\u201cEPP\u201d) to mitigate the impact on airline personnel.\u00a0 The statute granted the Secretary of Labor broad authority to promulgate regulations to implement the EPP, subject to a one-House legislative veto.\u00a0 In Alaska Airlines, Inc. v. Brock, the Court applied Chadha to conclude that Congress still would have delegated the same authority to the Secretary, even without the legislative veto.\u00a0 For any individual statute, considered in isolation, such an analysis may be persuasive.\u00a0 But if one considers the full range of laws subject to legislative veto provisions collectively\u2014an analysis our constitutional litigation process does not facilitate\u2014it is difficult to believe that Congress would have intended to materially alter the balance of power between the legislative and executive branches by conferring that same broad sweep of authority without the accompanying statutory checks. More recently, the Court has been applying severability analysis to bring previously independent or otherwise insulated officials and entities more firmly within the control of the President and other Executive Branch officials.\u00a0 Here too, the Court\u2019s presumption is that Congress would have granted the same authority and discretion to a government official or entity, even if it knew that the official or entity would be subject to greater executive oversight and control.\u00a0 Such reasoning appears to apply little value to constitutional checks-and-balances concerns, facilitating the aggregation of executive authority.\u00a0 Again, for any individual case, that reasoning may be persuasive.\u00a0 Collectively assessing the broad swath of restrictions on officers\u2019 removal that Congress has adopted which are likely subject to invalidation, however, the Court\u2019s assumption of congressional indifference to executive power may appear quite different. In Seila Law LLC v. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, for example, the Court held that it was unconstitutional for Congress to create an independent agency, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (\u201cCFPB\u201d), headed by a single officer who could be removed by the President only \u201cfor cause\u201d (meaning \u201cinefficiency, neglect, or malfeasance\u201d).\u00a0 Congress had established the CFPB through the Dodd-Frank Act as an independent agency.\u00a0 It had a half-billion dollar budget, \u201cpotent enforcement powers\u201d over more than 18 federal consumer protection laws, and \u201cextensive adjudicatory authority.\u201d\u00a0 The Court explained that, \u201c[s]ince its inception, the CFPB has obtained over $11 billion in relief for over 25 million customers.\u201d\u00a0 It concluded that, since the agency wielded tremendous executive authority and did not fall into any historical exceptions to the President\u2019s removal power, the Director\u2019s protection from at-will removal was unconstitutional. The Court then turned to the question of the proper remedy.\u00a0 It declared, \u201cWe think it clear that Congress would prefer that we use a scalpel rather than a bulldozer in curing the constitutional defect we identify today.\u201d \u00a0Citing the Dodd-Frank Act\u2019s severability clause, the Court held, \u201c[T]here is nothing in the text or history of the Dodd-Frank Act that demonstrates Congress would have preferred no CFPB to a CFPB supervised by the President.\u201d\u00a0 With the stroke of a pen, the Court created a new executive agency with its head removable at will by the President.\u00a0 In the name of judicial minimalism and deference to Congress, the Court enhanced the President\u2019s authority. The fact that Congress established the CFPB as an independent agency strongly suggests that it did not wish to lodge such substantial authority directly in the President without restriction.\u00a0 Of course, Congress\u2019 establishment of the CFPB in the first place also demonstrates that it saw the need to enhance consumer protections.\u00a0 The Court\u2019s severability analysis places much greater weight on the need to address the immediate tangible policy problems before Congress than the more abstract, overarching checks-and-balances concern about aggrandizing executive authority.\u00a0 Its ruling tilts the status quo in favor of the Executive, which can both lobby against and veto any effort to reduce this windfall of power.\u00a0 And by allowing the CFPB\u2019s day-to-day operations to continue unabated, the Court also substantially reduces any pressure on Congress to amend the Dodd-Frank Act to determine exactly how much authority it wishes to delegate to the President. The underlying problem with the Court\u2019s severability analysis is that it frames severability questions as a false binary.\u00a0 The Court considers only whether Congress would have preferred either: (i)\u00a0adopting the statute at issue without the unconstitutional provision, or (ii) rejecting the entire statutory scheme.\u00a0 In most cases, neither option is the most likely reflection of reality.\u00a0 When a statutory provision is unconstitutional, Congress typically would have wanted to adopt the underlying statutory scheme, but with modifications or offsets to limit the Executive Branch\u2019s authority.\u00a0 The Court, however, has no way to identify or impose the hypothetical counterfactual statute that Congress would have enacted, had it been prevented from including the constitutional infirmity in its legislation. By allowing modified grants of authority to the President or executive branch more broadly to remain in effect without the limits on executive power that Congress adopted, the Court creates a new statutory reality that Congress never endorsed in which it is much harder for Congress to adopt its actually-preferred alternative. \u00a0And the Court\u2019s approach to these severability issues tends to result in the continuous expansion and aggrandizement of executive authority and discretion.\u00a0 At a minimum, courts should be more attentive to these checks-and-balances concerns when performing a severability analysis.\u00a0 When assessing Congress\u2019 preferences in the course of a severability analysis, the Court should consider Congress\u2019 hypothetical intent not only with regard to the statute immediately before it, but also at a higher level of generality, concerning grants of authority of that type more broadly.

          "task_beliefs": "My model of this case has reached a new level of maturity. The initial phase of mapping the direct legal conflict is complete, and the focus has now shifted to the more nuanced task of predicting the Supreme Court's application of legal principles.\n\n*   **Petitioner's Arguments (Stable):** The U.S. Government's position is unchanged. It argues that Task Force members are either (1) properly appointed inferior officers under the supervision of the HHS Secretary (*Edmond v. United States*), or (2) not \"officers\" at all, but expert fact-finders without \"significant authority\" (*Buckley v. Valeo*, *United States v. Germaine*).\n*   **Respondents' Arguments (Stable):** Braidwood Management's counter-arguments are also firmly established in my model. They contend that Task Force members are principal officers because the statute's independence clause (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(6)) legally precludes the necessary supervision required for inferior officer status. They argue the ACA transformed the Task Force from an advisory body into one wielding significant, binding authority, thus making its members \"officers\" who must be appointed by the President with Senate confirmation.\n*   **The Remedial Clash (Stable):** The disagreement over the remedy remains a critical and distinct issue.\n    *   **Petitioner's Position:** Sever the independence clause but preserve the coverage mandate, following the *United States v. Arthrex, Inc.* precedent.\n    *   **Respondents' Position:** Do not sever the clause, as this would amount to judicial legislation, creating a subordinate body that Congress never intended.\n*   **Central Uncertainty (Evolved and Refined):** My primary uncertainty has fundamentally evolved. It is no longer a gap in my knowledge of the parties' arguments, but a predictive challenge regarding judicial interpretation. The core questions are now:\n    1.  **Interpretive Question:** How will the current composition of the Supreme Court weigh the statutory mandate for \"independence\" against the executive's power of supervision and removal? Will the Court's recent separation-of-powers jurisprudence favor a broad reading of executive control, or will it defer to the specific statutory text?\n    2.  **Remedial Question:** Will the Court see this as another *Arthrex*-style problem with a simple severability fix, or will it agree with the respondents that severing the independence clause fundamentally rewrites the statute in an impermissible way?\n    3.  **Key Precedents for Analysis:** My predictive model must now focus on how the Court is likely to apply and interpret its own recent, relevant decisions, particularly *Arthrex*, *Seila Law v. CFPB*, and *Edmond v. United States*, as these cases form the battleground on which this dispute will be fought.",
          "design_beliefs": "The latest observation solidifies my existing methodological framework and introduces a crucial new strategic layer, marking a transition from foundational knowledge acquisition to predictive analysis.\n\n1.  **Source Prioritization (Stable):** Prioritizing foundational documents (cert petitions, briefs) remains a highly effective initial strategy.\n2.  **Problem Decomposition (Stable):** Breaking the case down by legal question and then by remedy remains a robust analytical structure.\n3.  **Analogical Case Analysis (Stable):** Focusing on the precedents cited by the parties (*Edmond*, *Arthrex*, *Morrison*, etc.) is a confirmed high-value heuristic for understanding the core legal disputes.\n4.  **Staged Information Gathering (Validated and Expanded):** This core strategy has been proven effective and is now more detailed. The stages are:\n    *   Stage 1: Build a foundational model from a neutral source (e.g., cert petition).\n    *   Stage 2: Deepen the model by acquiring one party's detailed arguments.\n    *   Stage 3: Identify knowledge gaps and target the opposing party's arguments to create a balanced model of the conflict.\n    *   **New Stage 4:** Once the direct conflict is mapped, transition from gathering primary case documents to analyzing secondary sources and jurisprudential trends to predict the outcome.\n5.  **Identify the \"Escape Hatch\" (Stable):** The severability argument is confirmed as a critical, distinct issue that can determine the ultimate practical outcome of the case.\n6.  **Overarching Principle - Action Selection via Uncertainty Reduction (Confirmed):** The agent's explicit reasoning continues to demonstrate that selecting actions to resolve the largest and most central uncertainty is the most efficient path to building a robust model.\n7.  **Heuristic - Analyze Near-Misses and Unexpected Results (Confirmed):** The value derived from the unexpected amicus brief reinforces the need to analyze all retrieved information, even if it wasn't the primary target.\n8.  **Source Evaluation - Amicus Briefs for Novel Arguments (Confirmed):** Amicus briefs are confirmed as valuable sources for unique or alternative legal frameworks that may influence the Court.\n9.  **Heuristic - Refine Search Queries with Precise Terminology and Filters (Strongly Confirmed):** The successful use of \"brief of respondent\" and `link_name: main` validates this as a top-tier heuristic for efficient and precise information retrieval from document databases.\n10. **Heuristic - Analyze Procedural Posture for Strategic Signals (Confirmed):** The respondents' choice to file a \"Brief in Support of Certiorari\" is a confirmed signal of their confidence and strategic desire for a definitive ruling, teaching me to look for such signals in procedural filings.\n11. **New Heuristic - Transition from Factual Grounding to Predictive Analysis (New):** This represents a major evolution in my strategy. Once the \"what\" (the arguments) is known, the next step is to address the \"how\" (how the Court will decide). This involves a deliberate shift in information-gathering priorities from case-specific primary documents (briefs) to \"metadocuments\" (law reviews, legal blog analyses, etc.) that analyze the Court's recent jurisprudence on the key legal doctrines at play (e.g., Appointments Clause, severability). This allows for the construction of a predictive model based on the leanings of the specific Justices."

          "task_beliefs": "My predictive model of this case has matured from mapping the legal arguments to analyzing the specific judicial philosophies the Supreme Court will likely apply. The latest analysis of analogous precedents has significantly sharpened my understanding of the likely decision points.\n\n*   **Petitioner's Arguments (Stable):** The government maintains that Task Force members are either properly supervised inferior officers (*Edmond*) or mere employees without \"significant authority\" (*Buckley*, *Germaine*).\n*   **Respondents' Arguments (Stable):** Braidwood Management insists the statutory independence clause makes the members principal officers, as the ACA imbued them with \"significant authority\" they previously lacked.\n*   **The Remedial Clash (Stable):** The government advocates for a simple severability fix, excising the independence clause per the *Arthrex* precedent. The respondents argue this would be impermissible judicial rewriting of the statute.\n*   **Central Uncertainty (Evolved and Sharpened):** My predictive challenge is now framed by specific jurisprudential tests and competing judicial philosophies revealed through analysis of key precedents.\n    1.  **The \"Officer\" Test - A *Lucia* Analogy:** The analysis of *Lucia v. SEC* clarifies that the \"officer\" determination hinges on whether an official holds a \"continuing position\" and exercises \"significant authority.\" The Task Force members' four-year terms clearly meet the \"continuing position\" requirement. The crux of the matter is whether their power to issue binding coverage recommendations will be seen as analogous to the quasi-judicial powers of the ALJs in *Lucia* (taking testimony, conducting trials, ruling on evidence). The Court's own description of the \"significant authority\" test as \"amorphous\" and its application in *Lucia* as a \"modest,\" fact-specific comparison to *Freytag* suggests the outcome is not pre-ordained. My prediction now depends on whether the Court focuses narrowly on the *process* (the Task Force doesn't hold trials) or broadly on the *effect* (their decisions have binding legal force on private parties).\n    2.  **The Severability Philosophy - \"Scalpel\" vs. \"Anti-Aggrandizement\":** Analysis of the Court's recent severability jurisprudence reveals a deep philosophical divide that is central to the remedy in this case.\n        *   **The \"Scalpel\" Approach:** As seen in *Seila Law* and *Arthrex*, the Court has shown a strong preference for using a \"scalpel rather than a bulldozer,\" severing the unconstitutional provision (e.g., a removal restriction) to save the broader statutory scheme. This approach presumes Congress would prefer a constitutionally compliant agency over no agency at all. If the Court follows this minimalist path, it will sever the Task Force's independence clause, making its members subordinate to the HHS Secretary and preserving the coverage mandates.\n        *   **The \"Anti-Aggrandizement\" Critique:** A compelling counter-philosophy, articulated in legal scholarship, argues that this \"scalpel\" approach systematically enhances executive power in a way Congress never intended. By removing a legislative check (like independence) while leaving the delegation of power intact, the Court creates a new, more powerful executive entity by judicial fiat. This aligns perfectly with the respondents' argument that severing the clause would create a body Congress did not envision. If a majority of the Court is persuaded by this structural separation-of-powers concern, it would refuse to sever and invalidate the Task Force's authority entirely.\n    3.  **Refined Predictive Questions:** My model no longer asks \"what will they decide?\" but \"which philosophy will prevail?\" Will the Court's majority favor a broad or narrow reading of \"significant authority\"? And on the remedy, will the minimalist \"save the statute\" impulse of *Arthrex* win out, or will a more structuralist concern about executive aggrandizement lead the Court to strike the entire scheme?",
          "design_beliefs": "My methodological framework has been validated and refined, with the latest observation confirming the critical importance of transitioning from foundational fact-gathering to predictive jurisprudential analysis.\n\n1.  **Source Prioritization (Stable):** Foundational documents (briefs, petitions) are essential for Stage 1-3 model building.\n2.  **Problem Decomposition (Stable):** Separating the violation (Appointments Clause) from the remedy (severability) remains a highly effective analytical structure.\n3.  **Analogical Case Analysis (Evolved):** This heuristic has evolved. It is not enough to know the precedents the parties cite (*Edmond*, *Arthrex*). The crucial step is to **analyze the *interpretation* and *critique* of those precedents in secondary legal commentary.** Understanding that the *Lucia* holding was \"modest\" and that the *Seila Law* severability analysis faces an \"anti-aggrandizement\" critique provides a much deeper, more predictive layer of insight.\n4.  **Staged Information Gathering (Validated and Expanded):** The multi-stage approach is strongly confirmed.\n    *   Stages 1-3: Build a balanced model of the direct legal conflict from primary documents.\n    *   **Stage 4 (Strongly Validated):** Transitioning to analyzing `metadocuments` (legal scholarship, expert blogs like SCOTUSblog) is the correct strategy once the primary arguments are mapped. This stage provides the jurisprudential context and competing judicial philosophies necessary for true prediction.\n5.  **Identify the \"Escape Hatch\" (Stable):** The severability question is confirmed as a dispositive issue that can completely alter the practical outcome of a constitutional violation.\n6.  **Action Selection via Uncertainty Reduction (Confirmed):** The strategy of targeting the most significant uncertainty remains paramount. The shift from \"what are the arguments?\" to \"how will the Court apply these precedents?\" correctly guided the search for secondary sources.\n7.  **Heuristics (Stable & Confirmed):** Analyzing near-misses, using amicus briefs for novel arguments, refining search queries, and analyzing procedural posture are all confirmed as valuable heuristics.\n8.  **New Heuristic - Transition from Factual Grounding to Predictive Analysis (Confirmed & Refined):** This is now a core part of my methodology. The goal is to move from the \"what\" (the legal dispute) to the \"how\" and \"why\" (how the Court will likely reason). This involves a deliberate shift in source-gathering from primary case documents to secondary analytical and critical works.\n9.  **New Heuristic - Identify and Map Competing Judicial Philosophies (New):** The most significant new insight is that predicting outcomes in major constitutional cases requires identifying the underlying, often competing, judicial philosophies at play. The severability question in this case is a textbook example, pitting a minimalist \"save the statute\" philosophy against a structural \"anti-aggrandizement\" philosophy. The next step in a sophisticated prediction is to analyze which Justices are likely to align with which philosophy."
