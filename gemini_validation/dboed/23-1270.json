    "facts_of_the_case": "Riley entered the U.S. on a tourist visa in 1995. In 2006, he was indicted and later convicted of marijuana distribution and firearm charges, receiving a 25-year sentence. After being granted compassionate release in January 2021, immigration authorities took him into custody and ordered his removal due to his aggravated felony conviction. Though Riley expressed fear of returning to Jamaica, leading to various proceedings regarding potential persecution and torture claims, he ultimately was only eligible for deferral of removal under the Convention Against Torture (CAT). While an immigration judge initially granted this relief, the Board of Immigration Appeals reversed the decision in May 2022 and ordered Riley\u2019s removal to Jamaica. Riley petitioned for review, and his case was temporarily held pending the resolution of Martinez v. Garland. In Martinez, the U.S. Court Appeals for the Fourth Circuit held that an order denying CAT relief is not a final order of removal for purposes of \u00a7 1252(a)(1). Relying on Martinez, the Fourth Circuit dismissed Riley\u2019s appeal for lack of jurisdiction.",

This informs the broader design (D) of how to approach any given case.\n\nThe joint EIG is high (1.2) because this well-reasoned plan dramatically reduces uncertainty about the optimal path forward, making all subsequent actions more efficient and targeted.

The decisions of the Board of Im-\nmigration Appeals (App., infra, 7a-14a) and the immi-\ngration judge (App., infra, 15a-27a) are unreported. \nJURISDICTION \nThe Fourth Circuit entered judgment on April 26, \n2024.  This Court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \n1254(1).   \nSTATUTORY, TREATY, AND REGULATORY \nPROVISIONS INVOLVED \n8 U.S.C. 1252(a)(4) states in relevant part: \nNotwithstanding any other provision of law (stat-\nutory or nonstatutory), including section 2241 of \ntitle 28, or any other habeas corpus provision, and \nsections 1361 and 1651 of such title, a petition for \nreview filed with an appropriate court of appeals \nin accordance with this section shall be the sole \nand exclusive means for judicial review of any \ncause or claim under the United Nations Conven-\ntion Against Torture and Other Forms of Cruel, \nInhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punish-\nment, except as provided in subsection (e). \n\n2 \n \n8 U.S.C. 1252(b)(1) states:  \nThe petition for review must be filed not later \nthan 30 days after the date of the final order of \nremoval. \n8 U.S.C. 1252(b)(9) states:  \nJudicial review of all questions of law and fact, in-\ncluding interpretation and application of constitu-\ntional and statutory provisions, arising from any \naction taken or proceeding brought to remove an \nalien from the United States under this subchap-\nter shall be available only in judicial review of a \nfinal order under this section.  \n8 U.S.C. 1252(d)(1) states:  \nA court may review a final order of removal only \nif * * * the alien has exhausted all administrative \nremedies available to the alien as of right.  \n8 U.S.C. 1228(b) states: \n(1) The Attorney General may, in the case of an \nalien described in paragraph (2), determine \nthe deportability of such alien under section \n1227(a)(2)(A)(iii) of this title (relating to con-\nviction of an aggravated felony) and issue an \norder of removal pursuant to the procedures \nset forth in this subsection or section 1229a of \nthis title. \n(2) An alien is described in this paragraph if the \nalien\u2014 \n(A) was not lawfully admitted for permanent \nresidence at the time at which proceedings \nunder this section commenced; or \n\n3 \n \n(B) had permanent resident status on a condi-\ntional basis (as described in section 1186a \nof this title) at the time that proceedings \nunder this section commenced. \n(3) The Attorney General may not execute any or-\nder described in paragraph (1) until 14 calen-\ndar days have passed from the date that such \norder was issued, unless waived by the alien, \nin order that the alien has an opportunity to \napply for judicial review under section 1252 of \nthis title. \n(4) Proceedings before the Attorney General un-\nder this subsection shall be in accordance with \nsuch regulations as the Attorney General shall \nprescribe. The Attorney General shall provide \nthat\u2014 \n(A) the alien is given reasonable notice of the \ncharges and of the opportunity described \nin subparagraph (C); \n(B) the alien shall have the privilege of being \nrepresented (at no expense to the govern-\nment) by such counsel, authorized to prac-\ntice in such proceedings, as the alien shall \nchoose; \n(C) the alien has a reasonable opportunity to \ninspect the evidence and rebut the \ncharges; \n(D) a determination is made for the record that \nthe individual upon whom the notice for \nthe proceeding under this section is served \n(either in person or by mail) is, in fact, the \nalien named in such notice; \n\n4 \n \n(E) a record is maintained for judicial review; \nand \n(F) the final order of removal is not adjudicated \nby the same person who issues the \ncharges. \n(5) No alien described in this section shall be eli-\ngible for any relief from removal that the At-\ntorney General may grant in the Attorney \nGeneral\u2019s discretion. \nU.N. Convention Against Torture and Other \nCruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punish-\nment art. 3, Dec. 10, 1984, 1465 U.N.T.S. 114, sets \nforth:  \nNo State Party shall expel, return (\u201crefouler\u201d) or \nextradite a person to another State where there \nare substantial grounds for believing that he \nwould be in danger of being subjected to torture. \n8 C.F.R. 1208(e)(1) establishes, in relevant part, \nthat: \nPursuant to the provisions of section 2242(d) of the \nForeign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act of \n1998, there shall be no judicial appeal or review of \nany action, decision, or claim raised under the Con-\nvention [Against Torture] or that section, except as \npart of the review of a final order of removal pur-\nsuant to section 242 of the [Immigration and Na-\ntionality] Act. \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nThe precedents of the Fourth Circuit prevent broad \nclasses of noncitizens from seeking judicial review of \nclaims under the Convention Against Torture and \nOther Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or \n\n5 \nPunishment (\u201cCAT\u201d).  This outcome results from two \npersistent misinterpretations regarding jurisdiction \nand timing for petitions from the Board of Immigra-\ntion Appeals (\u201cBIA\u201d) that are contrary to Congress\u2019s \nexpress intentions.  Each of these misunderstandings \nis the basis of an entrenched circuit split, inde-\npendently warranting this Court\u2019s review.   \nFirst, 8 U.S.C. 1252(b)(1) requires a petition to be \nfiled within 30 days of the \u201cfinal order of removal.\u201d \nThe Fourth Circuit holds timely filing to be a jurisdic-\ntional prerequisite.  That holding deviates from the \nprecedents of at least two other circuits.  It is also con-\ntrary to this Court\u2019s teachings over the past two dec-\nades, which have repeatedly admonished that dead-\nlines are ordinarily not jurisdictional. \nSecond, the Fourth Circuit holds that a BIA deci-\nsion solely addressing CAT claims, with removability \nresolved at an earlier stage in the immigration pro-\nceeding, cannot constitute a \u201cfinal order of removal\u201d \nfor purposes of Section 1252(b)(1).  That holding pre-\ncludes judicial review of CAT claims for any nonciti-\nzen who lacks a colorable claim to non-removability, \nbecause the statute simultaneously bars judicial re-\nview until the administrative process is complete (i.e. \na BIA decision).  8 U.S.C. 1252(d)(1).  The Fourth Cir-\ncuit\u2019s doctrine is contrary to the precedents of at least \nfive other circuits, which hold the removal order does \nnot become \u201cfinal\u201d until completion of the administra-\ntive proceedings including resolution of claims under \nthe CAT.  The Fourth Circuit is joined only by the Sec-\nond Circuit, whose decision in Bhaktibhai-Patel v. \nGarland, 32 F.4th 180 (2d Cir. 2022), laid the ground-\nwork.  This position is mistaken as a matter of plain \ntext, because the statute says explicitly that an order \n\n6 \n \nof removal does not become \u201cfinal\u201d until the conclusion \nof BIA processes.  8 U.S.C. 1101(47)(B). \nMr. Riley is a Jamaican native who has lived in \nNew York City for nearly 30 years.  If he returns to \nJamaica, he faces a significant likelihood of being \nkilled by an influential local figure who has murdered \nseveral members of Riley\u2019s family and operates under \nthe government\u2019s aegis.  Riley had no colorable claim \nto cancellation of removal, because of a past criminal \nconviction.  But an immigration judge found Riley and \nhis documentary evidence credible and ruled his re-\nmoval should be deferred under the CAT.  Then the \nBIA, upon the government\u2019s appeal, reversed that de-\ncision.   \nThe government urged the Fourth Circuit to hear \nthe merits of the case.  The government has previously \nregarded the BIA\u2019s decision as marking the final order \nof removal, but the government said the Bhaktibhai-\nPatel decision obligated it to present the countervail-\ning possibility.  The government also explained (as did \nRiley) that the 30-day time limit should not be re-\ngarded as jurisdictional.  The Fourth Circuit resisted \nthe parties\u2019 entreaties, and concluded that Riley\u2019s fi-\nnal order of removal was the document issued at the \nbeginning of his case, not at the end.  Although Riley \nfiled his case within 30 days after the BIA decision, \nthat was 16 months after the initial document.  The \nFourth Circuit found that 16-month gap deprived it of \njurisdiction. \nThis case is a compelling vehicle for addressing \nboth questions.  The merits of Riley\u2019s case are strong, \nso much so that the Fourth Circuit granted a rare stay \nof his removal at the outset of the case.  A different \noutcome on either question would have allowed the \n\n7 \npanel to reach those merits.  In the Fifth Circuit, \nwhich differs on both questions presented, a nonciti-\nzen in comparable circumstances received judicial re-\nlief; there is ample reason to expect Riley would as \nwell, but for the Fourth Circuit\u2019s errors.  In particular, \nonce the 30-day deadline is recognized as nonjurisdic-\ntional, the Fourth Circuit can and should accept the \ngovernment\u2019s effort to waive the deadline. \nThe Fourth Circuit is wrong on both points, and \nboth are the basis of a substantial circuit split.  The \ndivide requires this Court\u2019s resolution.  Multiple \njudges have recognized the timeline should not be ju-\nrisdictional but have said they feel bound by Stone v. \nINS, 514 U.S. 386 (1995), a precedent under the pre-\n1996 statute, until this Court holds otherwise.  Multi-\nple courts have recognized the intractable split about \nwhat constitutes a final order of removal.  These prob-\nlems recur frequently in the mass of immigration ad-\njudications, and the issue is extraordinarily grave.  \nEven when the United States declines under domestic \npolicies to allow a noncitizen to stay, the CAT protects \nthe person from torture and death at the hands of the \nperson\u2019s original government.  The people who most \nneed that protection are exactly those whom the \nFourth Circuit excludes from judicial review.   \nI.\nSTATUTORY \nAND \nREGULATORY\nBACKGROUND\nUnder the Convention Against Torture, no coun-\ntry \u201cshall expel, return (\u2018refouler\u2019) or extradite a per-\nson to another State where there are substantial \ngrounds for believing that he would be in danger of \nbeing subjected to torture.\u201d  CAT art. 3, Dec. 10, 1984, \n1465 U.N.T.S. 114.  Congress implemented the CAT \n\n8 \n \nin the Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act \nof 1998 (\u201cFARRA\u201d).  Pub. L. No. 105-277, \u00a7 2242, 112 \nStat. 2681-822 (1998).  The government has \u201cno dis-\ncretion to deny relief to a noncitizen who establishes \nhis eligibility,\u201d and \u201c[a] conviction of an aggravated \nfelony has no effect on CAT eligibility.\u201d  Moncrieffe v. \nHolder, 569 U.S. 184, 187 n.1 (2013). \nCongress instructed the Department of Justice \n(\u201cDOJ\u201d) to issue regulations for processing CAT \nclaims.  FARRA \u00a72242(b).  Those regulations say an \notherwise removable noncitizen must not be removed \nto a country where it is \u201cmore likely than not that he \n[] would be tortured.\u201d  8 C.F.R. 1208.16(c)(2)-(3).  \u201cTor-\nture\u201d is defined as \u201cany act by which severe pain or \nsuffering, whether physical or mental, is intentionally \ninflicted ... by or at the instigation of or with the ac-\nquiescence of a public official.\u201d  Id. \u00a71208.18(a)(1).     \nIn general, the proceedings to remove a noncitizen \nfrom the country commence with a charging document \nfrom the Department of Homeland Security (\u201cDHS\u201d), \n8 C.F.R. 1003.14.  The case goes before an immigra-\ntion judge (\u201cIJ\u201d), who conducts an evidentiary hearing, \nfinds facts, and renders a conclusion about the noncit-\nizen\u2019s removability.  Id. \u00a7\u00a71240.10, 1240.12.  That de-\ncision includes not only an assessment whether the \nnoncitizen presents a valid defense to removal, but \nalso claims for other forms of relief, such as withhold-\ning of removal or protection under CAT.  See id. \n\u00a71240.12(c). \nTwo main categories of noncitizen are barred from \nvarious forms of relief through this process.  One cat-\negory is noncitizens who have responded to a removal \norder by leaving the country.  Upon reentry, the re-\n\n9 \n \nmoval order is reinstated, and \u201c[is] not subject to reo-\npening or review.\u201d  Johnson v. Guzman Chavez, 594 \nU.S. 523, 534 (2021) (quoting 8 U.S.C. 1231(a)(5)).  \nAnother category is noncitizens who have been con-\nvicted of \u201caggravated felonies\u201d; these individuals are \ngenerally ineligible for discretionary relief such as \ncancellation of removal.  Moncrieffe, 569 U.S. at 187.1 \nFor these individuals, DHS initiates a proceeding un-\nder 8 U.S.C. 1228(b).  That proceeding includes a no-\ntice of intent and then, if the person\u2019s status under \nSection 1228(b) is established, a \u201cFinal Administra-\ntive Removal Order.\u201d  8 C.F.R. 1238.1(b), (d). \nFor both categories, DOJ regulations establish \nprocedures for handling their CAT claims.  8 C.F.R. \n1208.31.  That process commences, for the second cat-\negory (which includes Riley), \u201c[u]pon issuance of a Fi-\nnal Administrative Removal Order.\u201d  Id. \u00a71208.31(a).  \nIf the noncitizen has expressed fear of returning to the \ncountry of removal, an officer conducts a reasonable-\nfear interview.  Id. \u00a71208.31(c)-(d).  If the officer finds \nreasonable fear of torture, the matter is referred to an \nIJ for withholding-only adjudication.  Id. \u00a71208.31(e).  \nThe IJ then holds an evidentiary hearing on the sub-\nstance of the CAT claim.  If the IJ finds the claim mer-\nitorious, the protection granted may be withholding of \nremoval or, for some individuals excluded from that \nrelief,2 deferral of removal.  Id. \u00a7\u00a71208.16(d), 1208.17. \n \n1 \u201cAggravated felony\u201d is defined to include many kinds of of-\nfenses, including any felony under the Controlled Substances \nAct.  569 U.S. at 188.   \n2 The exclusions from withholding of removal overlap with, but \ndiffer from, the bars against discretionary removal discussed \nabove.  8 C.F.R. 1208.16(d)(2), (3). \n\n10 \nEither the United States or the noncitizen may \nappeal \nthe \nIJ\u2019s \ndecision \nto \nthe \nBIA. \n \nId.  \n\u00a71208.31(g)(2)(ii).  The BIA is a body of administrative\njudges with nationwide jurisdiction over immigration\nappeals.  Id. \u00a71003.1.  The BIA can, on such an appeal,\nonly review the IJ\u2019s decision regarding the nonciti-\nzen\u2019s \u201celigibility for withholding or deferral of removal\nunder 8 C.F.R. 1208.16,\u201d the provision that encom-\npasses CAT claims (and claims to asylum).  Id.\n\u00a71208.31(g)(2)(ii).\nThe individual can petition for circuit-court re-\nview of an adverse BIA decision.  8 U.S.C. 1252(a)(1).  \n\u201c[A] petition for review filed with an appropriate court \nof appeals in accordance with this section shall be the \nsole and exclusive means for judicial review of any \ncause or claim under [CAT].\u201d  Id. \u00a71252(a)(4).

GARLAND, ATTORNEY GENERAL, \nRespondent.\nOn Petition for Review of an Order of the \nBoard of Immigration Appeals.\nMarch 27, 2024, Submitted; \nApril 26, 2024, Decided\nBefore KING, HARRIS, and QUATTLEBAUM, Circuit \nJudges.\nPetition dismissed by unpublished per curiam opinion.\nUnpublished opinions are not binding precedent in this \ncircuit.\n\nAppendix A\n2a\nPER CURIAM:\nPierre Yassue Nashun Riley, a native and citizen of \nJamaica, petitions for review of an order of the Board of \nImmigration Appeals (\u201cBoard\u201d) vacating the Immigration \nJudge\u2019s (\u201cIJ\u201d) order granting Riley\u2019s application for \ndeferral of removal under the Convention Against Torture \n(\u201cCAT\u201d) and ordering Riley removed to Jamaica. Because \nwe lack jurisdiction over Riley\u2019s petition for review, we \ndismiss it.\nI.\nRiley entered the United States in 1995 on a tourist \nvisa. In 2006, a federal grand jury returned an indictment \ncharging Riley with conspiracy to distribute and possess \nwith intent to distribute 1000 kilograms or more of \nmarijuana and possession of a firearm in furtherance of a \ndrug-trafficking crime. A jury found Riley guilty of both \noffenses, and he was sentenced to 25 years\u2019 imprisonment. \nIn January 2021, Riley was granted compassionate \nrelease.\nJust after Riley\u2019s release from federal prison, the \nimmigration authorities took custody of him. On January \n26, 2021, the Department of Homeland Security issued \na Final Administrative Removal Order, explaining that \nRiley was removable because he had been convicted of an \naggravated felony. See 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1228(b). Riley expressed \na fear of returning to Jamaica, and an immigration officer \nconducted a reasonable fear interview. The immigration \nofficer determined that Riley had not established a \n\nAppendix A\n3a\nreasonable fear of persecution or torture in Jamaica, but \nan IJ disagreed and referred Riley to the immigration \ncourt for withholding-only proceedings.\nRiley appeared with counsel before the IJ and \nconceded removability under \u00a7 1228(b). Although Riley \napplied for asylum, statutory withholding of removal, \nand both withholding of removal and deferral of removal \nunder CAT, he later conceded that he was eligible only for \ndeferral of removal under CAT given his prior convictions.\nAfter an evidentiary hearing, the IJ granted Riley\u2019s \napplication for deferral of removal under CAT. The \nDepartment of Homeland Security appealed the IJ\u2019s \ndecision to the Board, and a three-member panel of \nthe Board issued a May 31, 2022, unpublished decision \nsustaining the appeal. That is, the Board vacated the \nIJ\u2019s order granting relief and ordered Riley removed to \nJamaica.\nOn June 3, 2022, Riley petitioned this court for review \nof the Board\u2019s decision. We later placed this appeal in \nabeyance for the issuance of the mandate in Martinez v. \nGarland, No. 22-1221 (4th Cir.). The mandate in Martinez \nhas issued, and so Riley\u2019s case has been removed from \nabeyance.\n\nAppendix A\n4a\nII.\nA.\n\u201cWe have an independent obligation to assure ourselves \nof jurisdiction to decide an appeal.\u201d Martinez v. Garland, \n86 F.4th 561, 566 (4th Cir. 2023). We generally possess \njurisdiction to review \u201ca final order of removal.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1252(a)(1). A noncitizen must petition for review within \n30 days \u201cof the final order of removal.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)\n(1). \u201cThe 30-day deadline is mandatory and jurisdictional \nand is not subject to equitable tolling.\u201d Martinez, 86 F.4th \nat 566 (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201c[O]nce we have \na final order of removal before us, we can consider along \nwith it \u2018all questions of law and fact . . . arising from any \naction taken or proceeding brought to remove [the] alien \nfrom the United States.\u2019\u201d Id. (quoting 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)\n(9)) (ellipsis and second alteration in original).\nRiley seeks review of the Board\u2019s order vacating \nthe IJ\u2019s order and denying his application for deferral \nof removal under CAT. We recently held in Martinez, \nhowever, that an order denying CAT relief is not a final \norder of removal for purposes of \u00a7 1252(a)(1). Id. at 567. \nSo for us to exercise jurisdiction over the Board\u2019s order \ndenying CAT relief, Riley \u201cmust identify another eligible \norder\u201d that is properly before us. Id. But Riley cannot \ndo so because he did not timely petition for review of \na final order of removal. That is, Riley did not petition \nfor review within 30 days of the January 26, 2021, Final \nAdministrative Removal Order. So there is no final order \nof removal properly in front of us that would allow us to \n\nAppendix A\n5a\nreview the Board\u2019s order denying CAT relief. We thus \nlack jurisdiction over Riley\u2019s petition for review. Id. at 571.\nB.\nRiley offers several arguments in favor of our \nexercise of jurisdiction, but none convinces us. To start, \nRiley contends that Martinez should not control in this \ncase because it involves a Final Administrative Order of \nRemoval issued under \u00a7 1228(b), not a reinstated removal \norder, which Martinez addressed. But Riley offers no \npersuasive justification for differentiating between those \ntwo types of orders when applying the jurisdictional \nprinciples delineated in Martinez, and we discern no \nreason to do so.\nRiley next argues that the Final Administrative Order \nof Removal was not actually final for purposes of \u00a7 1252(a)\n(1) because he applied for asylum. Riley was statutorily \nineligible for asylum, however, and he effectively withdrew \nhis asylum application during his merits hearing. See 8 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(2)(A)(ii), (B)(i). Because Riley could not \nhave obtained asylum relief, his asylum application did \nnot impact his removability. The Final Administrative \nOrder of Removal was thus in fact final despite Riley\u2019s \nasylum application.\nFinally, Riley maintains that we may exercise \njurisdiction over the Board\u2019s order affirming the denial \nof CAT relief under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(4) (\u201c[A] petition \nfor review filed with an appropriate court of appeals in \naccordance with this section shall be the sole and exclusive \n\nAppendix A\n6a\nmeans for judicial review of any cause or claim under \n[CAT.]\u201d). But that provision means only that we may \nreview an order denying CAT relief as part of our review \nof a final order of removal. It does not authorize us to \nreview an order denying CAT relief without a final order \nof removal properly before us. See Nasrallah v. Barr, \n140 S. Ct. 1683, 1691, 207 L. Ed. 2d 111 (2020) (citing \u00a7 \n1252(a)(4) and explaining that order denying CAT relief \nis reviewable \u201cas part of the review of a final order of \nremoval\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)); Martinez, \n86 F.4th at 567 (recognizing that federal appellate court \nmay review order denying CAT relief only as part of its \nreview of final order of removal); Bhaktibhai-Patel v. \nGarland, 32 F.4th 180, 190 n.13 (2d Cir. 2022) (explaining \nthat \u00a7 1252(a)(4) does not enable federal appellate court to \nexercise jurisdiction over order denying CAT relief \u201cin the \nabsence of a judicially reviewable final order of removal\u201d).\nIII.\nBecause we lack jurisdiction, we dismiss the petition \nfor review. We dispense with oral argument because the \nfacts and legal contentions are adequately presented in \nthe materials before this court and argument would not \naid the decisional process.\nPETITION DISMISSED\n\nAppendix B\n7a\nAPPENDIX B \u2014 OPINION OF THE UNITED \nSTATES DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE, \nEXECUTIVE OFFICE FOR IMMIGRATION \nREVIEW, BOARD OF IMMIGRATION APPEALS, \nFILED MAY 31, 2022\nU.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE \nEXECUTIVE OFFICE FOR IMMIGRATION \nREVIEW\nBOARD OF IMMIGRATION APPEALS\nMATTER OF:\nPIERRE YASSUE NASHUN RILEY, A097-534-840\nApplicant\nIN WITHHOLDING ONLY PROCEEDINGS\nOn Appeal from a Decision of the Immigration Court, \nArlington, VA\nBefore: Baird, Appellate Immigration Judge; Gorman, \nAppellate Immigration Judge; Wilson, Appellate \nImmigration Judge\nOpinion by Appellate Immigration Judge Wilson\nWILSON, Appellate Immigration Judge\nThe Department of Homeland Security (\u201cDHS\u201d) has \nappealed from an Immigration Judge\u2019s July 27, 2021, \ndecision granting the applicant\u2019s request for protection \nunder the regulations implementing the Convention \n\nAppendix B\n8a\nAgainst Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d).1 The applicant, a native and \ncitizen of Jamaica, has filed responses in opposition to \nDHS\u2019 appeal. The appeal will be sustained.\nWe review the Immigration Judge\u2019s factual findings \nfor clear error. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(d)(3)(i). Questions of law, \ndiscretion and judgment, and all other issues, are reviewed \nde novo. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).\nThe applicant alleged before the Immigration Judge \nthat a man named \n a gang leader in \nhis former neighborhood in Kingston and a drug kingpin, \nwill torture or kill him upon his return to Jamaica. He \nalleges that \n killed two of the applicant\u2019s cousins \nin 2008 and 2011 and has recently sent death threats to \nhis mother and sister because he believes the applicant \nwill seek retribution against him for killing his cousins \n(IJ at 8; Tr. at 47-48, 55-59; Exhs. 2, 6A).\nThe Immigration Judge found that based on the \napplicant\u2019s credible testimony and the background \ninformation in the case he has demonstrated that he faces a \nparticularized risk of torture and that it is more likely than \n1.\u2002  The Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman \nor Degrading Treatment or Punishment, Dec. 10, 1984, S. Treaty \nDoc. No. 100-20, 1465 U.N.T.S. 85 (entered into force for United \nStates Nov. 20, 1994). The applicant\u2019s attorney stated that he is \nonly applying for deferral of removal under the CAT (Tr. at 33). The \nImmigration Judge found the applicant is not eligible for asylum, \nwithholding of removal under the INA or withholding of removal \nunder the CAT because he has been convicted of a particularly \nserious crime (IJ at 6). This finding has not been contested on appeal.\n\nAppendix B\n9a\nnot that \n will harm the applicant upon his return \nto Jamaica (IJ at 9-10). In addition, the Immigration Judge \nfound that the applicant credibly testified that \n \nhas influence with the neighborhood and the police, that \nthe applicant would be forced to register with the police \nand keep them informed of his movements, which would \nallow \n to know his whereabouts and that he will \nmore likely than not be tortured with the acquiescence of \nthe government (IJ at 10).\nDHS challenges the Immigration Judge\u2019s positive \ncredibility determination (IJ at 4-6). Based on the \ndeferential clear error standard of review, we discern \nno clear error in the Immigration Judge\u2019s credibility \ndetermination and will treat the applicant\u2019s testimony as \ncredible for purposes of this appeal.\nHowever, as explained more fully below, we discern \nclear error in the Immigration Judge\u2019s factual findings \nregarding what is likely to happen to the applicant upon \nhis removal to Jamaica, and we agree with DHS that the \napplicant has not met his burden of proof to show eligibility \nfor deferral of removal under the CAT. The applicant \nbears the burden to show that it is more likely than not \nthat he would be tortured in Jamaica by, or with the \nconsent or acquiescence (to include the concept of willful \nblindness) of, a public official or an individual acting in \nan official capacity. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1208.16(c), 1208.18. The \napplicant must make two distinct showings: (i) likely \nfuture mistreatment, i.e., that it is more likely than not he \nwill endure severe pain or suffering that is intentionally \ninflicted; and (ii) that the likely future mistreatment will \n\nAppendix B\n10a\noccur at the hands of the government or with the consent \nor acquiescence of the government. Cruz-Quintanilla v. \nWhitaker, 914 F.3d 884, 886 (4th Cir. 2019). Importantly, an \napplicant cannot establish eligibility by stringing together \na series of suppositions to show that it is more likely than \nnot that torture will result where the evidence does not \nestablish that each step in the hypothetical chain of events \nis more likely than not to happen. Matter of J-F-F-, 23 \nI&N Dec. 912, 917-18 (A.G. 2006). An Immigration Judge\u2019s \nfindings regarding the likelihood of future harm and of \nacquiescence by the government (i.e., what is likely to \nhappen) are factual findings that the Board reviews for \nclear error. Whether that predicted future harm meets \nthe definition of torture and whether future governmental \nconduct meets the definition of consent or acquiescence \nare questions of law we review de novo. Turkson v. Holder, \n667 F.3d 523, 530 (4th Cir. 2012).\nDHS argues on appeal that the Immigration Judge \nerred in finding that the applicant showed he will more \nlikely than not be tortured and should have found that \nhe presented a speculative chain of events that would \nhappen to him. We agree. While the Immigration Judge \nfound that the applicant has shown a particularized risk \nof torture, this finding is based on speculative assertions \nby the respondent regarding \nThe applicant, who has been in the United States \nfor many years, claims that \n killed two of his \ncousins in Jamaica. But other than his testimony, which \nis not based on first-hand knowledge, there is no objective \ncorroborating evidence that \n killed his relatives \n\nAppendix B\n11a\nor why. Indeed, the grand jury indictment in California \nagainst \n states he was arrested on February 12, \n2010, on his way to pick up marijuana, and thus, he would \nhave been incarcerated in the United States at the time \nof the cousin\u2019s murder in 2011 (Exh. 6D). When asked \nhow he knows \n killed his cousins, he stated that \n and his gang members \u201cbrag about this stuff\u201d \n(Tr. at 51-52). Yet, the affidavits from the applicant\u2019s \nfamily make no mention of \n (Exh. 6). Nor do \nthe affidavits from the applicant\u2019s mother, sister, and \nstepfather mention \n when describing threats \nto kill the applicant they received in 2021 (Exh. 6B). The \nmother\u2019s affidavit states she received phone calls \u201cfrom \nindividuals who live in Jamaica threatening to kill [the \napplicant] on site should he come home\u201d and that neighbors \nreported to her that three masked men asked about the \napplicant\u2019s whereabouts (Exh. 6B; Tr. at 68-69). The \napplicant\u2019s sister states in her affidavit that \u201cpeople\u201d have \nasked about him and unknown guys told her the applicant \nhas a green light on him but did not tell her why (Exh. 6B; \nTr. at 68-69). When the applicant was asked why \n \nhas any interest in harming him now and sees him as a \nthreat, the applicant testified \u201c[t]hat\u2019s the big question\u201d \nand that he will expect the applicant to retaliate against \n for his cousins\u2019 deaths because that is the \n\u201cJamaican lifestyle\u201d (Tr. at 47-48). Thus, the applicant\u2019s \nclaims that \n killed or ordered the killing of his \ncousins and is behind the threats his mother and sister \nreceived in 2021 are speculative.\nThe Immigration Judge also found that country \nconditions evidence supports the applicant\u2019s claim \n\nAppendix B\n12a\nbut cited generalized statements in the 2020 State \nDepartment Report regarding government human \nrights abuses, fatalities involving government security \nforces, allegations of torture of people in police custody, \nand insufficient action in addressing abuse and unlawful \nkillings by security forces (IJ at 8-9; Exh. 4C). The \nImmigration Judge did not explain and did not cite to \nany particular evidence of record corroborating the claim \nthat \n is an ex-police officer, that he controls the \napplicant\u2019s old neighborhood, that he killed the applicant\u2019s \nrelatives, or that he poses a particularized risk of harm to \nthe applicant that would amount to torture. The country \nconditions evidence does not mention \n and does \nnot indicate the police will acquiesce in torture. In fact, the \nevidence the applicant cites in his brief on appeal is either \ninformation about crime and safety for foreign travelers to \nJamaica or evidence indicating that crime is a significant \nproblem, but the evidence also indicates that Jamaica \nhas an independent police oversight body and that efforts \nare made to address gangs, corruption, and impunity for \npolice killings (Exh. 6 at pages 142-52, 158-64). Moreover, \nthe mother\u2019s affidavit does not demonstrate a likelihood \nof acquiescence simply because the police stated it would \nnot investigate threats from unknown persons against the \napplicant who currently is not in Jamaica (Exh. 6B). The \nmere existence of a pattern of human rights violations \nin a particular country does not constitute a sufficient \nground for finding that a person would more likely than \nnot be tortured. Nolasco v. Garland, 7 F.4th 180, 191 (4th \nCir. 2021).\n\nAppendix B\n13a\nThus, we conclude that the respondent\u2019s claim is \nbased on the stringing together of a series of suppositions \nand is not supported by sufficient objective evidence to \ncorroborate his speculative fear of torture by \n or \nthat the government will acquiesce in his torture. Matter \nof O-R-E-, 28 I&N Dec. 330, 350 (BIA 2021); Matter of \nJ-F-F-, 23 I&N Dec. at 917-18.2\nFor these reasons, we will reverse the Immigration \nJudge\u2019s determination that the applicant has demonstrated \nthat it is more likely than not that he would be subjected \nto torture inflicted by, or at the instigation of or with the \nconsent, acquiescence, or willful blindness of a Jamaican \npublic official or other person acting in an official capacity \nfor purposes of deferral of removal under the CAT.\n2.\u2002  The applicant also alleges in his reply brief that the \nImmigration Judge did not consider, in the aggregate, the likelihood \nof torture because of his status as a criminal deportee and his long-\ntime residence in the United States (Respondent\u2019s Reply Br. at 22-\n24). However, the Immigration Judge found that the applicant never \nmentioned that he fears the police directly (IJ at 7). The applicant \nstates he will be required to register with the government and wear \nan ankle monitor and cites evidence stating that criminal deportees \nare stigmatized (Exh. 6 at 263-303, 310-25). However, he has not \ncited specific evidence that police or other government officials \nsubject criminal deportees to extreme mistreatment, intentionally \ninflict torture on them, or that he personally faces a risk of torture \nby the government or with the consent or acquiescence of a public \nofficial. The evidence he cites does not mention torture of criminal \ndeportees, but rather discusses the difficulty criminal deportees \nhave reintegrating into society and the blame they experience by \nsociety and the government for rising crime rates (Exh. 6). Thus, \nwe find this claim to be without merit.\n\nAppendix B\n14a\nAccordingly, the following orders will be entered.\nORDER: The Department of Homeland Security\u2019s \nappeal is sustained.\nFURTHER ORDER: The Immigration Judge\u2019s order \ndated July 27, 2021, granting deferral of removal under \nthe CAT is vacated, and the applicant is ordered removed \nfrom the United States to Jamaica.\n\nAppendix C\n15a\nAPPENDIX C \u2014 DECISION AND ORDER OF THE \nUNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE, \nEXECUTIVE OFFICE FOR IMMIGRATION \nREVIEW, UNITED STATES IMMIGRATION \nCOURT, ARLINGTON, VIRGINIA, \nDATED JULY 27, 2021\nUNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE\nEXECUTIVE OFFICE FOR IMMIGRATION \nREVIEW\nUNITED STATES IMMIGRATION COURT\nARLINGTON, VIRGINIA\nFile: A097-534-840\nIn the Matter of\nPIERRE YASSUE NASHUN RILEY\nApplicant\nIN WITHHOLDING ONLY PROCEEDINGS\nJuly 27, 2021\nCHARGES:\nAPPLICATIONS: \t For m I- 5 89, application for \nwithholding of removal under INA \nSection 241(b)(3), and under the \nConvention against Torture.\n\nAppendix C\n16a\nORAL DECISION OF THE IMMIGRATION JUDGE\nPROCEDURAL HISTORY\nApplicant is a native and citizen of Jamaica. He \nlast entered the United States on a visitor visa in 1995; \noverstayed. While in the United States he was arrested \ntwice. First in 1998 for marijuana possession as a minor, \nyouthful offender, and then in 2006 he was convicted for \ndistribution of marijuana and possession of a firearm in \nfurtherance of that distribution and then was sentenced to \n25 years\u2019 incarceration. Fast forward to 2021, the District \nCourt Judge signed an order authorizing compassionate \nrelease, and thereafter he was placed in ICE custody \nand was ordered removed pursuant to INA Section \n238(b). And then he claimed a reasonable fear which an \nImmigration Judge found to be reasonable and placed in \nthese proceedings.\nSUMMARY OF RELEVANT TESTIMONY\nApplicant was born on March 22, 1979, native and \ncitizen of Jamaica, lived in Kingston. He did use an alias, \nAdrian Francis for ID and to get into certain bars and \nclubs, what have you. He last entered the United States \nunder his real name on February 3, 1995 and never left. \nHe testified to having distributed marijuana in the past, \nacknowledged that he was convicted and sentenced to 25 \nyears. Ultimately he was released. He said if he returned \nto Jamaica he would be tortured and killed by a man \nnamed \n\nAppendix C\n17a\nThis person, \n he is from the \nneighborhood of Central Kingston, Jamaica, same \nneighborhood as the applicant. In fact, applicant said he \nknew \n His family knew him growing up. \nApplicant said that \n took over the neighborhood \nsometime in the 2000\u2019s. He was an ex-cop, supporter of the \nJLP Party, and after he took over the neighborhood he and \nhis supporters in the neighborhood would harm people and \nproperty. Applicant testified that at one point \n \neven came to the United States but he still had contacts \nin his old neighborhood in Jamaica, including authorities. \nApplicant testified that \n was deported back to \nJamaica from the United States sometime in 2016 or \n2017. He knows because the applicant\u2019s mother and sister \nstill live in Jamaica. They have seen \n Applicant \ntestified also that \n has an issue with his family. \nHe had killed two of the applicant\u2019s cousins, a person \nnamed O\u2019Neal, as well as a person named Darrel, and \nthen threatened all male relatives which includes the \napplicant, that he would kill them or threaten to kill them \nif they return or if he sees them in Jamaica. And this is \nbecause, according to the applicant, \n feels that \nthe relatives of the two people that he murdered would \nexact revenge for the murders against \n Now, \n wants to harm the applicant because he thinks \napplicant is going to seek revenge against him.\nRegarding these two cousins who died, one was \nO\u2019Neal, he died in 2008. He was actually somewhat \nassociated with \n He used to give money to him to \npay off groups, individuals and politics. But when O\u2019Neal \nwanted to quit doing this \n killed him because he \n\nAppendix C\n18a\ntook that as a sign of disrespect. Applicant said that the \npolice did nothing to investigate or solve O\u2019Neal\u2019s murder. \nAnd in fact, when his other cousin, Darrel Scott, tried to \nget the police to investigate further, \n ordered him \nkilled, according to word on the street. That was sometime \nin March 2011. The police, according to applicant, did not \ninvestigate Darrel\u2019s death.\nThe applicant, after serving 15 years in prison, \nwas released for his marijuana distribution conviction, \nfollowing a sentence reduction. Thereafter, his mother \nstarted receiving calls threatening to harm the applicant \nif he ever returned to Jamaica. Applicant said there was \neven a car with masked men who approached applicant\u2019s \nmother looking for the applicant in Jamaica. Applicant \ntestified that his mother then went to file a police report \nbut the police told applicant\u2019s mother that the applicant \nwas not even in Jamaica as among the reasons why they \nrefused to take the report. They also knew that the report \nwas against \n Applicant said that his \nmother was even approached at work by \n himself \nand threatened that he will kill the applicant. At this \npoint the applicant told his mother to stop reporting to \nthe police for fear of being killed. He said his sister also \nreceived communication from \n in Jamaica. They \nthreatened to harm the applicant. He said that the people \nwho approached his sister said they have the green light to \nmurder the applicant from \n Applicant \nalso testified as two other individuals who live in the same \nneighborhood as he did in Jamaica both died following \ndeportation back. He said he cannot relocate anywhere \nin Jamaica because Jamaican authorities force him to \n\nAppendix C\n19a\nregister upon his return, they would know where he is. \nThat would tie directly into \n and allow \n \nto easily become aware of where the applicant is located. \nThat and the entire country of Jamaica is about the size \nof New Jersey. It is fairly small.\nCross-examination he said at the interview that he \ngrew up in a neighborhood controlled by the JLP. But \nexplained that was just a point of fact, not like a choice that \nhe was making. He also clarified that he could be killed \nas a member or for being a supporter of the JLP because \nthat is just the way people are killed in Jamaica. There is \na lot of violence; a lot of it is political. And he indicated he \ndid not mean to claim that he was a member of the JLP \nor the family was a member of the JLP.\nLAW FINDINGS, ANALYSIS, CREDIBILITY, \nCORROBORATION\nWhen testimony is offered in support of an application \nfor relief the Court must consider whether such testimony \nis credible. INA Section 240(c)(4)(B). For applications filed \nafter May 11, 2005 provisions of the REAL ID Act govern \nthe credibility analysis. Making this determination the \nCourt considers the totality of the circumstances and \nall relevant factors. See id. Section 240(c)(4)(C). Matter \nof J-Y-C-, 24 I&N Dec. 260, 262 (BIA 2007). Generally, \nto be credible, testimony shall satisfactorily explain any \nmaterial discrepancies or omissions, INA Section 240(c)\n(4)(C).

The decisions of the Board of Im-\nmigration Appeals (App., infra, 7a-14a) and the immi-\ngration judge (App., infra, 15a-27a) are unreported. \nJURISDICTION \nThe Fourth Circuit entered judgment on April 26, \n2024.  This Court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \n1254(1).   \nSTATUTORY, TREATY, AND REGULATORY \nPROVISIONS INVOLVED \n8 U.S.C. 1252(a)(4) states in relevant part: \nNotwithstanding any other provision of law (stat-\nutory or nonstatutory), including section 2241 of \ntitle 28, or any other habeas corpus provision, and \nsections 1361 and 1651 of such title, a petition for \nreview filed with an appropriate court of appeals \nin accordance with this section shall be the sole \nand exclusive means for judicial review of any \ncause or claim under the United Nations Conven-\ntion Against Torture and Other Forms of Cruel, \nInhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punish-\nment, except as provided in subsection (e). \n\n2 \n \n8 U.S.C. 1252(b)(1) states:  \nThe petition for review must be filed not later \nthan 30 days after the date of the final order of \nremoval. \n8 U.S.C. 1252(b)(9) states:  \nJudicial review of all questions of law and fact, in-\ncluding interpretation and application of constitu-\ntional and statutory provisions, arising from any \naction taken or proceeding brought to remove an \nalien from the United States under this subchap-\nter shall be available only in judicial review of a \nfinal order under this section.  \n8 U.S.C. 1252(d)(1) states:  \nA court may review a final order of removal only \nif * * * the alien has exhausted all administrative \nremedies available to the alien as of right.  \n8 U.S.C. 1228(b) states: \n(1) The Attorney General may, in the case of an \nalien described in paragraph (2), determine \nthe deportability of such alien under section \n1227(a)(2)(A)(iii) of this title (relating to con-\nviction of an aggravated felony) and issue an \norder of removal pursuant to the procedures \nset forth in this subsection or section 1229a of \nthis title. \n(2) An alien is described in this paragraph if the \nalien\u2014 \n(A) was not lawfully admitted for permanent \nresidence at the time at which proceedings \nunder this section commenced; or \n\n3 \n \n(B) had permanent resident status on a condi-\ntional basis (as described in section 1186a \nof this title) at the time that proceedings \nunder this section commenced. \n(3) The Attorney General may not execute any or-\nder described in paragraph (1) until 14 calen-\ndar days have passed from the date that such \norder was issued, unless waived by the alien, \nin order that the alien has an opportunity to \napply for judicial review under section 1252 of \nthis title. \n(4) Proceedings before the Attorney General un-\nder this subsection shall be in accordance with \nsuch regulations as the Attorney General shall \nprescribe. The Attorney General shall provide \nthat\u2014 \n(A) the alien is given reasonable notice of the \ncharges and of the opportunity described \nin subparagraph (C); \n(B) the alien shall have the privilege of being \nrepresented (at no expense to the govern-\nment) by such counsel, authorized to prac-\ntice in such proceedings, as the alien shall \nchoose; \n(C) the alien has a reasonable opportunity to \ninspect the evidence and rebut the \ncharges; \n(D) a determination is made for the record that \nthe individual upon whom the notice for \nthe proceeding under this section is served \n(either in person or by mail) is, in fact, the \nalien named in such notice; \n\n4 \n \n(E) a record is maintained for judicial review; \nand \n(F) the final order of removal is not adjudicated \nby the same person who issues the \ncharges. \n(5) No alien described in this section shall be eli-\ngible for any relief from removal that the At-\ntorney General may grant in the Attorney \nGeneral\u2019s discretion. \nU.N. Convention Against Torture and Other \nCruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punish-\nment art. 3, Dec. 10, 1984, 1465 U.N.T.S. 114, sets \nforth:  \nNo State Party shall expel, return (\u201crefouler\u201d) or \nextradite a person to another State where there \nare substantial grounds for believing that he \nwould be in danger of being subjected to torture. \n8 C.F.R. 1208(e)(1) establishes, in relevant part, \nthat: \nPursuant to the provisions of section 2242(d) of the \nForeign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act of \n1998, there shall be no judicial appeal or review of \nany action, decision, or claim raised under the Con-\nvention [Against Torture] or that section, except as \npart of the review of a final order of removal pur-\nsuant to section 242 of the [Immigration and Na-\ntionality] Act. \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nThe precedents of the Fourth Circuit prevent broad \nclasses of noncitizens from seeking judicial review of \nclaims under the Convention Against Torture and \nOther Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or \n\n5 \nPunishment (\u201cCAT\u201d).  This outcome results from two \npersistent misinterpretations regarding jurisdiction \nand timing for petitions from the Board of Immigra-\ntion Appeals (\u201cBIA\u201d) that are contrary to Congress\u2019s \nexpress intentions.  Each of these misunderstandings \nis the basis of an entrenched circuit split, inde-\npendently warranting this Court\u2019s review.   \nFirst, 8 U.S.C. 1252(b)(1) requires a petition to be \nfiled within 30 days of the \u201cfinal order of removal.\u201d \nThe Fourth Circuit holds timely filing to be a jurisdic-\ntional prerequisite.  That holding deviates from the \nprecedents of at least two other circuits.  It is also con-\ntrary to this Court\u2019s teachings over the past two dec-\nades, which have repeatedly admonished that dead-\nlines are ordinarily not jurisdictional. \nSecond, the Fourth Circuit holds that a BIA deci-\nsion solely addressing CAT claims, with removability \nresolved at an earlier stage in the immigration pro-\nceeding, cannot constitute a \u201cfinal order of removal\u201d \nfor purposes of Section 1252(b)(1).  That holding pre-\ncludes judicial review of CAT claims for any nonciti-\nzen who lacks a colorable claim to non-removability, \nbecause the statute simultaneously bars judicial re-\nview until the administrative process is complete (i.e. \na BIA decision).  8 U.S.C. 1252(d)(1).  The Fourth Cir-\ncuit\u2019s doctrine is contrary to the precedents of at least \nfive other circuits, which hold the removal order does \nnot become \u201cfinal\u201d until completion of the administra-\ntive proceedings including resolution of claims under \nthe CAT.  The Fourth Circuit is joined only by the Sec-\nond Circuit, whose decision in Bhaktibhai-Patel v. \nGarland, 32 F.4th 180 (2d Cir. 2022), laid the ground-\nwork.  This position is mistaken as a matter of plain \ntext, because the statute says explicitly that an order \n\n6 \n \nof removal does not become \u201cfinal\u201d until the conclusion \nof BIA processes.  8 U.S.C. 1101(47)(B). \nMr. Riley is a Jamaican native who has lived in \nNew York City for nearly 30 years.  If he returns to \nJamaica, he faces a significant likelihood of being \nkilled by an influential local figure who has murdered \nseveral members of Riley\u2019s family and operates under \nthe government\u2019s aegis.  Riley had no colorable claim \nto cancellation of removal, because of a past criminal \nconviction.  But an immigration judge found Riley and \nhis documentary evidence credible and ruled his re-\nmoval should be deferred under the CAT.  Then the \nBIA, upon the government\u2019s appeal, reversed that de-\ncision.   \nThe government urged the Fourth Circuit to hear \nthe merits of the case.  The government has previously \nregarded the BIA\u2019s decision as marking the final order \nof removal, but the government said the Bhaktibhai-\nPatel decision obligated it to present the countervail-\ning possibility.  The government also explained (as did \nRiley) that the 30-day time limit should not be re-\ngarded as jurisdictional.  The Fourth Circuit resisted \nthe parties\u2019 entreaties, and concluded that Riley\u2019s fi-\nnal order of removal was the document issued at the \nbeginning of his case, not at the end.  Although Riley \nfiled his case within 30 days after the BIA decision, \nthat was 16 months after the initial document.  The \nFourth Circuit found that 16-month gap deprived it of \njurisdiction. \nThis case is a compelling vehicle for addressing \nboth questions.  The merits of Riley\u2019s case are strong, \nso much so that the Fourth Circuit granted a rare stay \nof his removal at the outset of the case.  A different \noutcome on either question would have allowed the \n\n7 \npanel to reach those merits.  In the Fifth Circuit, \nwhich differs on both questions presented, a nonciti-\nzen in comparable circumstances received judicial re-\nlief; there is ample reason to expect Riley would as \nwell, but for the Fourth Circuit\u2019s errors.  In particular, \nonce the 30-day deadline is recognized as nonjurisdic-\ntional, the Fourth Circuit can and should accept the \ngovernment\u2019s effort to waive the deadline. \nThe Fourth Circuit is wrong on both points, and \nboth are the basis of a substantial circuit split.  The \ndivide requires this Court\u2019s resolution.  Multiple \njudges have recognized the timeline should not be ju-\nrisdictional but have said they feel bound by Stone v. \nINS, 514 U.S. 386 (1995), a precedent under the pre-\n1996 statute, until this Court holds otherwise.  Multi-\nple courts have recognized the intractable split about \nwhat constitutes a final order of removal.  These prob-\nlems recur frequently in the mass of immigration ad-\njudications, and the issue is extraordinarily grave.  \nEven when the United States declines under domestic \npolicies to allow a noncitizen to stay, the CAT protects \nthe person from torture and death at the hands of the \nperson\u2019s original government.  The people who most \nneed that protection are exactly those whom the \nFourth Circuit excludes from judicial review.   \nI.\nSTATUTORY \nAND \nREGULATORY\nBACKGROUND\nUnder the Convention Against Torture, no coun-\ntry \u201cshall expel, return (\u2018refouler\u2019) or extradite a per-\nson to another State where there are substantial \ngrounds for believing that he would be in danger of \nbeing subjected to torture.\u201d  CAT art. 3, Dec. 10, 1984, \n1465 U.N.T.S. 114.  Congress implemented the CAT \n\n8 \n \nin the Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act \nof 1998 (\u201cFARRA\u201d).  Pub. L. No. 105-277, \u00a7 2242, 112 \nStat. 2681-822 (1998).  The government has \u201cno dis-\ncretion to deny relief to a noncitizen who establishes \nhis eligibility,\u201d and \u201c[a] conviction of an aggravated \nfelony has no effect on CAT eligibility.\u201d  Moncrieffe v. \nHolder, 569 U.S. 184, 187 n.1 (2013). \nCongress instructed the Department of Justice \n(\u201cDOJ\u201d) to issue regulations for processing CAT \nclaims.  FARRA \u00a72242(b).  Those regulations say an \notherwise removable noncitizen must not be removed \nto a country where it is \u201cmore likely than not that he \n[] would be tortured.\u201d  8 C.F.R. 1208.16(c)(2)-(3).  \u201cTor-\nture\u201d is defined as \u201cany act by which severe pain or \nsuffering, whether physical or mental, is intentionally \ninflicted ... by or at the instigation of or with the ac-\nquiescence of a public official.\u201d  Id. \u00a71208.18(a)(1).     \nIn general, the proceedings to remove a noncitizen \nfrom the country commence with a charging document \nfrom the Department of Homeland Security (\u201cDHS\u201d), \n8 C.F.R. 1003.14.  The case goes before an immigra-\ntion judge (\u201cIJ\u201d), who conducts an evidentiary hearing, \nfinds facts, and renders a conclusion about the noncit-\nizen\u2019s removability.  Id. \u00a7\u00a71240.10, 1240.12.  That de-\ncision includes not only an assessment whether the \nnoncitizen presents a valid defense to removal, but \nalso claims for other forms of relief, such as withhold-\ning of removal or protection under CAT.  See id. \n\u00a71240.12(c). \nTwo main categories of noncitizen are barred from \nvarious forms of relief through this process.  One cat-\negory is noncitizens who have responded to a removal \norder by leaving the country.  Upon reentry, the re-\n\n9 \n \nmoval order is reinstated, and \u201c[is] not subject to reo-\npening or review.\u201d  Johnson v. Guzman Chavez, 594 \nU.S. 523, 534 (2021) (quoting 8 U.S.C. 1231(a)(5)).  \nAnother category is noncitizens who have been con-\nvicted of \u201caggravated felonies\u201d; these individuals are \ngenerally ineligible for discretionary relief such as \ncancellation of removal.  Moncrieffe, 569 U.S. at 187.1 \nFor these individuals, DHS initiates a proceeding un-\nder 8 U.S.C. 1228(b).  That proceeding includes a no-\ntice of intent and then, if the person\u2019s status under \nSection 1228(b) is established, a \u201cFinal Administra-\ntive Removal Order.\u201d  8 C.F.R. 1238.1(b), (d). \nFor both categories, DOJ regulations establish \nprocedures for handling their CAT claims.  8 C.F.R. \n1208.31.  That process commences, for the second cat-\negory (which includes Riley), \u201c[u]pon issuance of a Fi-\nnal Administrative Removal Order.\u201d  Id. \u00a71208.31(a).  \nIf the noncitizen has expressed fear of returning to the \ncountry of removal, an officer conducts a reasonable-\nfear interview.  Id. \u00a71208.31(c)-(d).  If the officer finds \nreasonable fear of torture, the matter is referred to an \nIJ for withholding-only adjudication.  Id. \u00a71208.31(e).  \nThe IJ then holds an evidentiary hearing on the sub-\nstance of the CAT claim.  If the IJ finds the claim mer-\nitorious, the protection granted may be withholding of \nremoval or, for some individuals excluded from that \nrelief,2 deferral of removal.  Id. \u00a7\u00a71208.16(d), 1208.17. \n \n1 \u201cAggravated felony\u201d is defined to include many kinds of of-\nfenses, including any felony under the Controlled Substances \nAct.  569 U.S. at 188.   \n2 The exclusions from withholding of removal overlap with, but \ndiffer from, the bars against discretionary removal discussed \nabove.  8 C.F.R. 1208.16(d)(2), (3). \n\n10 \nEither the United States or the noncitizen may \nappeal \nthe \nIJ\u2019s \ndecision \nto \nthe \nBIA. \n \nId.  \n\u00a71208.31(g)(2)(ii).  The BIA is a body of administrative\njudges with nationwide jurisdiction over immigration\nappeals.  Id. \u00a71003.1.  The BIA can, on such an appeal,\nonly review the IJ\u2019s decision regarding the nonciti-\nzen\u2019s \u201celigibility for withholding or deferral of removal\nunder 8 C.F.R. 1208.16,\u201d the provision that encom-\npasses CAT claims (and claims to asylum).  Id.\n\u00a71208.31(g)(2)(ii).\nThe individual can petition for circuit-court re-\nview of an adverse BIA decision.  8 U.S.C. 1252(a)(1).  \n\u201c[A] petition for review filed with an appropriate court \nof appeals in accordance with this section shall be the \nsole and exclusive means for judicial review of any \ncause or claim under [CAT].\u201d  Id. \u00a71252(a)(4).  Simi-\nlarly, FARRA allows review of a CAT claim only \u201cas \npart of the review of a final order of removal pursuant \nto\u201d 8 U.S.C. 1252.  FARRA \u00a72242(d).  The \u201cpetition for \nreview must be filed not later than 30 days after the \ndate of the final order of removal.\u201d  8 U.S.C. \n1252(b)(1).   \nSection 1252(a)(2)(C) declares that \u201c[n]otwith-\nstanding any other provision of law, ... no court shall \nhave jurisdiction to review any final order of removal \nagainst an alien who is removable\u201d on account of cer-\ntain criminal convictions, including aggravated felo-\nnies.  In Nasrallah v. Barr, the Court held this provi-\nsion does not restrict review of CAT claims for such \npersons, because the BIA\u2019s decision on a CAT claim \u201cis \nnot itself a final order of removal.\u201d  590 U.S. 573, 590 \n(2020).  Yet the statute also defines an \u201corder of de-\nportation\u201d not to be \u201cfinal\u201d until the BIA has affirmed \nthe order (or time for seeking BIA review has elapsed).  \n\n11 \n \n8 U.S.C. 1101(47)(B).  Thus, the previous orders in the \ncourse of the administrative process would not be \u201cfi-\nnal orders of removal.\u201d \nII. FACTUAL BACKGROUND \nRiley is from Jamaica.  R. 271-273 (No. 22-1609, \nECF 24-1).  He entered the United States in 1995 on \na tourist visa, R. 137, and has lived in this country \nsince then.  He has seven children, all U.S. citizens.  \nR. 271-273.  In 2011, Riley was convicted of an earlier \nconspiracy to distribute marijuana (and of a related \nfirearms charge).  R. 623.  While in prison, Riley en-\nrolled in a variety of courses, completed his GED, \ngraduated summa cum laude with an associate de-\ngree, and tutored dozens of fellow inmates. R. 274; R. \n372; R. 380. In January 2021, the district court \ngranted him compassionate release because his diabe-\ntes put him at substantial risk from COVID-19 and \nbecause the court found the time he had served was \nsufficient punishment.  R. 363-366.  \nImmigration and Customs Enforcement immedi-\nately took Riley into custody for removal proceedings.  \nOn January 27, 2021, DHS served Riley a notice of in-\ntent to issue a removal order.  R. 827-R. 828.  One day \nlater, DHS issued a document titled \u201cFinal Adminis-\ntrative Removal Order\u201d (\u201cFARO\u201d) finding that Riley \nhad been convicted of an aggravated felony and must \nbe deported to Jamaica.  R. 825.   \nIn a subsequent reasonable-fear interview, Riley \nexplained that a particular drug kingpin, associated \nwith the Jamaican government, already ordered the \nmurder of several of Riley\u2019s relatives, and threatened \nto kill Riley upon his return.  R. 645-660.   \n\n12 \nIII.\nPROCEEDINGS BELOW\nRiley then filed a formal request for CAT relief.  At \nan evidentiary hearing before an IJ, Riley testified, \nand presented a range of documentary evidence along-\nside his testimony, as well as affidavits from relatives.  \nThe kingpin is a former police officer with strong con-\nnections with the Jamaican government and influence \nover the police.  R. 144-145.  After he ordered the kill-\ning of two of Riley\u2019s cousins, the Jamaican police did \nnot investigate those murders.  R. 145.  The kingpin \nhas threatened to kill all male members of the family, \nid., and men have approached family members still in \nJamaica to threaten Riley\u2019s murder when he arrives.  \nR. 146-147.\nThe IJ, finding Riley credible, determined that if \nRiley is sent to Jamaica, more likely than not the king-\npin will have him killed, with the acquiescence of that \ncountry\u2019s government.  R. 134-135.  Riley is not eligi-\nble for withholding of removal, due to his prior con-\nspiracy conviction, but the IJ ordered his removal de-\nferred pursuant to the CAT.  R. 135. \nDHS appealed the IJ\u2019s decision to the BIA.  R. 081-\n083. The BIA judge purported to accept the IJ\u2019s posi-\ntive determination of Riley\u2019s credibility, but proceeded\nto reverse the finding that Riley will more likely than\nnot be killed in Jamaica.  The BIA said it found no\n\u201ccorroborating evidence\u201d proving the past murders of\nRiley\u2019s relatives, and it held that Riley must prove\nthose past murders are also more likely than not, as\nwell as the predicted future killing.  R. 004-005.  The\nBIA criticized the IJ for demanding corroborating ev-\nidence for only parts of Riley\u2019s testimony.  Id.\n\n13 \n \nRiley promptly petitioned the Fourth Circuit for \nreview of the BIA\u2019s decision.  The Fourth Circuit \ngranted a stay of Riley\u2019s removal pending the disposi-\ntion of his petition.   \nMeanwhile, the Second Circuit decided Bhak-\ntibhai-Patel, which held that a CAT-only decision by \nthe BIA about a noncitizen with a reinstated removal \norder is not a \u201cfinal order of removal,\u201d so that a peti-\ntion from that BIA decision is not within 30 days of a \n\u201cfinal order.\u201d  32 F.4th at 190-191.  The government\u2019s \nanswer brief in Riley\u2019s case acknowledged that \u201c[h]is-\ntorically, the Attorney General has taken the position, \nand the courts of appeals have agreed, that finality for \npurposes of judicial review is obtained only after the \ncompletion of all proceedings connected to a reinstate-\nment order, including the final disposition of any rea-\nsonable-fear or withholding-only proceedings.\u201d Gov't \nC.A. Br. 22 (No. 22-1609, ECF 33-1).  But in light of \nBhaktibhai-Patel, the government said it felt obli-\ngated to question that approach.  The government \nurged the court to review the merits of Riley\u2019s case \nwhile establishing a jurisdictional rule for future \ncases.  Id. at 28. \nIn May 2023, this Court decided, in Santos-Zaca-\nria v. Garland, that Section 1252(d)(1), allowing re-\nview only to a noncitizen who has exhausted adminis-\ntrative remedies, is not a jurisdictional limitation.  \n598 U.S. 411 (2023).  Riley then asked the Fourth Cir-\ncuit to conclude that the 30-day deadline (the time for \nfiling after a final order of removal) is also not juris-\ndictional.  The government agreed with that sugges-\ntion and urged the court again to decide the merits.   \nRiley C.A. 28(j) Ltr. (July 12, 2023). \n\n14 \nIn the meantime, the Fourth Circuit decided San-\ntos-Zacaria does not affect the Fourth Circuit\u2019s prece-\ndents about the 30-day deadline.  The doctrine that \nthe deadline is jurisdictional remains mandated by \nStone, the court concluded, and the court held that \nSantos-Zacaria had not overruled Stone.  Salgado v. \nGarland, 69 F.4th 179, 181 & n.1 (4th Cir. 2023).   \nIn November 2023, the Fourth Circuit decided to \nfollow Bhaktibhai-Patel, and held that an \u201can order \ndenying CAT relief is not a final order of removal for \npurposes of [8 U.S.C.] \u00a7 1252(a)(1),\u201d so that the court \nlacked jurisdiction to review a CAT order issued after \nwithholding-only proceedings.  Martinez v. Garland, \n86 F.4th 561, 567 (4th Cir. 2023).  The Martinez peti-\ntioner promptly sought rehearing, and the Fourth Cir-\ncuit held Riley\u2019s case in abeyance pending the decision \non that rehearing request. \nAfter the court denied rehearing in Martinez, it \nproceeded to dismiss Riley\u2019s petition, in reliance on \nMartinez.  App., infra, 1a-6a. \nREASONS FOR GRANTING THE PETITION \nThe Court should grant certiorari to resolve two \nsplits that have divided the circuits on issues funda-\nmental to review of immigration matters, which make \nup a significant portion of circuit-court dockets.  First, \nthe Court should make clear that the Section \n1252(b)(1) deadline is not a jurisdictional limitation. \nThat conclusion follows from two decades of the \nCourt\u2019s reiterated teaching about what is truly juris-\ndictional.  But some circuit courts still feel themselves \nbound by Stone, and need this Court to issue a correc-\n\n15 \n \ntion.  Second, what constitutes the final order of re-\nmoval, in a withholding-only proceeding, has gener-\nated deep confusion in the lower courts.  That the \nsame case might lead to reversal in one circuit and \ndismissal in another is intolerable. \nI. THERE IS AN ACKNOWLEDGED AND \nDEEP SPLIT ON THE QUESTIONS PRE-\nSENTED. \nThe circuits are profoundly divided on the ques-\ntions presented here. \nA. The circuits disagree whether Sec-\ntion 1252(b)(1)\u2019s deadline is juris-\ndictional. \nThe Court has never directly addressed whether \nSection 1252(b)(1)\u2019s 30-day deadline is a jurisdictional \nrule.  There is now a well-defined circuit split on this \nissue, demanding the Court\u2019s further clarification. \nStone arose under the predecessor provisions (be-\nfore a 1996 overhaul of the immigration statute).  The \nCourt addressed whether a reconsideration motion at \nthe agency would toll or restart the time for judicial \nreview.  514 U.S. at 405-06.  In concluding there is no \nsuch pause for reconsideration, the Court stated that \n\u201cstatutory provisions specifying the timing of review \n... are, as we have often stated, \u2018mandatory and juris-\ndictional.\u2019\u201d  Id. at 405.   \nStone did not address whether the deadline at is-\nsue could be waived by the government, as a truly ju-\nrisdictional prerequisite cannot be.  Arbaugh v. Y&H \nCorp., 546 U.S. 500, 514 (2006).  Nor did Stone decide \nwhether Section 1252(b)(1)\u2019s deadline, at issue here, \nis jurisdictional; Section 1252(b)(1) was not enacted \n\n16 \n \nuntil a year later.  Pub. L. No. 104-208, \u00a7306(a)(2), (b), \n110 Stat. 3009-607, 3009-607.    \nNevertheless, circuit courts across the country \nthen applied Stone to conclude Section 1252(b)(1) also \nstates a \u201cmandatory and jurisdictional\u201d limitation.  \nMagtanong v. Gonzales, 494 F.3d 1190, 1191 (9th Cir. \n2007).  See Zhang v. INS, 348 F.3d 289, 292 (1st Cir. \n2003); Malvoisin v. INS, 268 F.3d 74, 76 (2d Cir. \n2001); Tshibonge v. Ashcroft, 81 F. App\u2019x 785, 786 (4th \nCir. 2003); Navarro-Miranda v. Ashcroft, 330 F.3d \n672, 676 (5th Cir. 2003); Prekaj v. INS, 384 F.3d 265, \n267 (6th Cir. 2004); Sankarapillai v. Ashcroft, 330 \nF.3d 1004, 1006 (7th Cir. 2003); Skurtu v. Mukasey, \n552 F.3d 651, 658 (8th Cir. 2008); Nahatchevska v. \nAshcroft, 317 F.3d 1226, 1227 (10th Cir. 2003); Da-\nkane v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., 371 F.3d 771, 774 n.3 (11th \nCir. 2004). \nSince then, the Court has concluded that courts \nhave overused the concept of \u201cjurisdiction.\u201d  In Ar-\nbaugh, the Court observed that \u201crecent decisions ... \nhave clarified that time prescriptions, however em-\nphatic, \u2018are not properly typed \u2018jurisdictional.\u2019\u201d  546 \nU.S. at 510.  In Henderson ex rel. Henderson v. \nShinseki, the Court declined to rely on Stone as au-\nthority that deadlines are usually jurisdictional.  To \nthe contrary, the Court explained, \u201c[f]iling deadlines, \n... are quintessential claim-processing rules\u201d that are \nnot jurisdictional.  562 U.S. 428, 435 (2011).  Then \nSantos-Zacaria stated explicitly that \u201cwe treat a rule \nas jurisdictional only if Congress clearly states that it \nis.\u201d  598 U.S. at 416.  The Court observed that Stone \nis inconsistent with the last two decades of precedent \n\u201cthat \u2018bring some discipline to the use of th[e] term ju-\nrisdictional.\u2019\u201d  Id. at 421.   \n\n17 \n \nIn the wake of Santos-Zacaria, five circuits have \nrevisited their precedents holding Section 1252(b)(1) \nis jurisdictional.  The Ninth Circuit and the Fifth \nCircuit have both now held that it is not, and that \nSantos-Zacaria abrogated their previous precedents.  \nAlonso-Juarez v. Garland, 80 F.4th 1039, 1056 (9th \nCir. 2023); Argueta-Hernandez v. Garland, 87 F.4th \n698, 705 (5th Cir. 2023).  These circuits found the Sec-\ntion 1252(b)(1) 30-day deadline \u201csuffers from the same \nflaw\u201d as the Court identified in Santos-Zacaria.  \nAlonso-Juarez, 80 F.4th at 1047; Argueta-Hernandez, \n87 F.4th at 705.  Section 1252(b)(1)\u2019s deadline is in the \nsame statute as Section 1252(d)(1), the provision that \nSantos-Zacaria deemed non-jurisdictional, and simi-\nlarly lacks language making it plainly jurisdictional.  \nId.  Accordingly, \u201calthough we previously relied on \nStone to hold that \u00a7 1252(b)(1) was a jurisdictional \nrule, that reasoning is now \u2018clearly irreconcilable\u2019 with \nthe Supreme Court's intervening reasoning in Santos-\nZacaria.\u201d  Alonso-Juarez, 80 F.4th at 1047. \nIn contrast, the Seventh Circuit adheres to its \nprior precedents that Section 1252(b)(1)\u2019s filing dead-\nline is jurisdictional.  F.J.A.P. v. Garland, 94 F.4th \n620, 626 (7th Cir. 2024).  The Seventh Circuit was \n\u201caware that ... Santos-Zacaria v. Garland called the \njurisdictionality of \u00a7 1252(b)(1) into question, but it \ndid not directly overrule Stone.\u201d  Id.  \u201c[U]ntil Stone is \noverturned by the Court itself,\u201d the Seventh Circuit \nholds, \u201cwe must continue to apply it.\u201d  Id. (citations \nomitted).3  The Eleventh Circuit reached a similar \n \n3 As discussed below, F.J.A.P. ultimately accepted jurisdiction \nover its petitioner\u2019s case, because the Seventh Circuit joined the \nmajority view about what constitutes a final order of removal in \na withholding-only case. \n\n18 \n \nconclusion in an unpublished decision.  Allen v. Att\u2019y \nGen., No. 23-13044, 2024 WL 164403, at *2 (11th Cir. \nJan. 16, 2024) (\u201c[W]e are obligated to follow [our prior \nprecedent] because Santos-Zacaria is not clearly on \npoint\u2026.\u201d). \nThe Fourth Circuit, similarly, believes Stone \nstill controls this issue.  Salgado enforced the 30-day \ndeadline as a jurisdictional limitation.  \u201cBecause the \nholding in Santos-Zacaria is limited to \u00a71252(d)(1) \nand the Supreme Court has not overruled Stone, we \nare bound to apply Stone unless and until the Su-\npreme Court provides to the contrary.\u201d  69 F.4th at \n181 n.1.  Martinez, too, enforced the 30-day deadline \nas a jurisdictional bar, on the basis of Stone.  86 F.4th \nat 572.  The court refused to entertain supplemental \nbriefing on the consequences of Santos-Zacaria, be-\ncause Salgado had already established that Stone re-\nmains binding.  Id. at 566 n.3.  Judge Floyd, concur-\nring in the judgment, noted that Santos-Zacaria \n\u201ccast[s] doubt on our characterization of the deadline \nas \u2018jurisdictional\u2019\u201d and \u201cstrongly suggests\u201d the 30-day \ndeadline is a claims-processing rule.  Id. at 574.  But \nhe \u201crecogniz[ed] this panel is bound by this Court\u2019s \nprevious treatment of \u00a71252(b)(1) as jurisdictional.\u201d  \nId. \nThus, there is now an established split on whether \nSection 1252(b)(1) states a jurisdictional limitation.  \nTwo circuits, the Fifth and the Ninth, hold that it \ndoes not.  Four circuits have, since Santos-Zacaria, \ncontinued to apply their prior precedents treating Sec-\ntion 1252(b)(1) as jurisdictional, but without assessing \nthe impact of Santos-Zacaria.  See Valderamos-Ma-\ndrid v. Garland, No. 21-6221, 2023 WL 5423960, at *1 \n(2d Cir. 2023); Duenas v. Att\u2019y Gen., No. 22-3024, 2023 \n\n19 \nWL 6442601, at *2 (3d Cir. 2023); Kolov v. Garland, \n78 F.4th 911, 917 n.4 (6th Cir. 2023); Arostegui-Mal-\ndonado v. Garland, 75 F.4th 1132, 1140 (10th Cir. \n2023).  Three circuits, the Fourth, the Seventh, and \nthe Eleventh, have explicitly concluded that Section \n1252(b)(1) remains jurisdictional notwithstanding \nSantos-Zacaria.   \nThis split will not disappear without the Court\u2019s \nintervention.  In F.J.A.P. and Martinez, the govern-\nment itself asked the courts to correct their precedent, \nbut they refused.  In this case, the government explic-\nitly asked the lower court to conclude the 30-day dead-\nline is non-jurisdictional, but to no avail.  At least \nseven judges\u2014the panels in F.J.A.P. and Salgado, \nand Judge Floyd in Martinez\u2014have said they need the \nCourt to overrule Stone before they can cease miscat-\negorizing Section 1252(b)(1).  In these courts where \nprecedent dictates clearly that Stone, from this Court, \nis binding on this issue and has not been overruled, no \nen banc rehearing is likely to reconsider that conclu-\nsion.  Indeed, the Fourth Circuit denied rehearing in \nMartinez.  Order, Martinez v. Garland, No. 22-1221 \n(4th Cir. Mar. 1, 2024).   \nB. The circuits disagree about when\nSection 1252(b)(1)\u2019s 30-day dead-\nline begins in withholding-only\ncases.\nUntil recently, every circuit agreed that Section \n1252(b)(1)\u2019s 30-day deadline ran from the conclusion \nof agency withholding-only proceedings.  See Garcia \nv. Sessions, 856 F.3d 27, 35 (1st Cir. 2017); Garcia-\nVilleda v. Mukasey, 531 F.3d 141, 144 (2d Cir. 2008);\nBonilla v. Sessions, 891 F.3d 87, 90 n.4 (3d Cir. 2018);\n\n20 \n \nTomas-Ramos v. Garland, 24 F.4th 973, 980 n.3 (4th \nCir. 2022); Luna-Garcia de Garcia v. Barr, 921 F.3d \n559, 565 & n.4 (5th Cir. 2019); Martinez v. Larose, 968 \nF.3d 555, 563 (6th Cir. 2020); Garcia-Arce v. Barr, 946 \nF.3d 371 (7th Cir. 2019) Lara-Nieto v. Barr, 945 F.3d \n1054, 1058 (8th Cir. 2019); Ortiz-Alfaro v. Holder, 694 \nF.3d 955, 958 (9th Cir. 2012); Luna-Garcia v. Holder, \n777 F.3d 1182, 1186 (10th Cir. 2015); Jimenez-Mo-\nrales v. Att\u2019y Gen., 821 F.3d 1307, 1308 (11th Cir. \n2016).  That was also the government\u2019s view.  Gov\u2019t \nC.A. Br. 22.    \nBut Nasrallah and Guzman Chavez have caused \ntwo circuits to conclude their prior precedents are \noverruled, generating another split openly acknowl-\nedged among seven circuits. \nNasrallah \nexamined \nwhether \nSection \n1252(a)(2)(C)\u2019s bar \u201cprecluding judicial review of fac-\ntual challenges to final orders of removal\u201d also \u201cpre-\nclude[s] factual challenges to CAT orders\u201d during \nwithholding-only proceedings.  590 U.S. at 581.  The \nCourt concluded it does not, because a CAT decision is \nnot itself a final order of removal.  Id. at 582-583.  The \nCourt noted that Congress did not explicitly foreclose \njudicial review of CAT orders, and the Court said it \nwould not interpret the statute to do so implicitly.  Id. \nat 583.   \nIn Guzman Chavez, the Court decided the govern-\nment can detain noncitizens who were ordered re-\nmoved from the United States, later reentered the \ncounty without authorization, and sought withhold-\ning-only relief to prevent the government from execut-\ning those orders based on fears of returning to their \nhome country.  594 U.S. at 526.  The statute requires \n\n21 \n \nsuch detention when a removal is \u201cadministratively fi-\nnal.\u201d  8 U.S.C. 1231.  The Court concluded that a rein-\nstated removal order is \u201cadministratively final\u201d even \nthough withholding-only proceedings are pending.  Id. \nat 545-546.   \nThough Nasrallah said its analysis should not \u201caf-\nfect the authority of the courts of appeals to review \nCAT orders,\u201d 590 U.S. at 585, and Guzman Chavez \nsaid the Court was not expounding the meaning of \u201cfi-\nnal[ity]\u201d under Section 1252, 594 U.S. at 535 n.6, two \ncircuits have held that these decisions do in fact \nchange what counts as a \u201cfinal order of removal\u201d start-\ning the 30-day clock.   \nThe Second Circuit and the Fourth Circuit \nhold that the BIA\u2019s decision in a withholding-only case \nis not a \u201cfinal order of removal\u201d; that \u201cfinal order\u201d \ncame at some past point, such as the FARO in Riley\u2019s \ncase or the reinstatement order in Martinez and \nBhaktibhai-Patel.  Bhaktibhai-Patel reasoned that \n\u201c[d]ecisions made during withholding-only proceed-\nings cannot qualify as orders of removal,\u201d per Nasral-\nlah, and therefore withholding-only orders are not fi-\nnal orders of removal for Section 1252(b)(1) purposes.  \n32 F.4th at 190-91.  According to the Second Circuit, \n\u201ca reinstatement decision becomes final once the \nagency's review process is complete,\u201d at which time \nthe 30-day filing window begins to run, and the court \ndoes not have jurisdiction under Section 1252(b)(1) to \nreview a final CAT decision if a petitioner waits until \ncompletion of withholding-only proceedings to appeal.  \nId. at 192-93.   \nMartinez followed that lead to conclude that, after \nNasrallah, withholding-only proceedings do not lead \nto a final order of removal.  The final order of removal \n\n22 \n \nmust have been issued some time previously, at the \noutset of the withholding-only proceedings.  86 F.4th \nat 567.  The proceedings below applied the same rea-\nsoning to Riley\u2019s withholding-only case arising from a \nFARO.  App., infra, 4a (\u201c[A]n order denying CAT relief \nis not a final order of removal for purposes of \n\u00a7 1252(a)(1).\u201d).  The court \u201cdiscern[ed] no reason\u201d to \n\u201cdifferentiat[e] between those two types of orders\u201d\u2014a \nreinstatement order or a FARO\u2014\u201cwhen applying the \njurisdictional principles delineated in Martinez.\u201d  \nApp., infra, 5a.  The court identified the FARO, which \nas explained above is the beginning of the withhold-\ning-only process, as the final order of removal in Ri-\nley\u2019s case.  App., infra, 4a. \nBecause withholding-only proceedings inevitably \ntake more than 30 days, a petition filed after the BIA\u2019s \ndecision in those proceedings will necessarily be later \nthan 30 days after the initial order that the Second \nand the Fourth Circuits deem the \u201cfinal order of re-\nmoval.\u201d  Thus, such petitions will always fail the Sec-\ntion 1252(b)(1) deadline, and\u2014under precedents in \nboth circuits\u2014be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. \nThe Fourth Circuit and the Second Circuit are in \nthe minority on this issue.  Five other circuits\u2014the \nFifth, Sixth, Seventh, Ninth, and Tenth Cir-\ncuits\u2014have all held that an order of removal does not \nbecome \u201cfinal,\u201d thus triggering the 30-day deadline, \nuntil the conclusion of the proceedings regarding CAT \nrelief.  F.J.A.P., 94 F.4th at 638; Alonso-Juarez, 80 \nF.4th at 1056; Argueta-Hernandez, 87 F.4th at 705-06; \nKolov, 78 F.4th at 919; Arostegui-Maldonado, 75 F.4th \nat 1143. \nThe Seventh Circuit, in an opinion by Judge St. \nEve, specifically rejected the reasoning in Martinez \n\n23 \n \nand Bhaktibhai-Patel and surveyed the decisions of \nthe Fifth, Sixth, Ninth, and Tenth Circuits. F.J.A.P., \n94 F.4th at 629-30.  In viewing what it characterized \nas a \u201ccircuit split,\u201d the Seventh Circuit analyzed \nNasrallah and Guzman Chavez and concluded that \nneither decision determined the meaning of finality \nunder Section 1252(b)(1).  Id. at 631-33.  \nAccordingly, the Seventh Circuit engaged in a de-\ntailed analysis of the statutory text, after which it con-\ncluded that \u201c[o]nly when withholding proceedings are \ncomplete have \u2018the rights, obligations, and legal con-\nsequences of the reinstated removal order\u2019 been fully \nestablished.\u201d  Id. at 633-35 (citation omitted).  The \ncourt further emphasized that this \u201cplain meaning of \nthe statute comports with the principle of statutory \nconstruction that presumes congressional intent in fa-\nvor of judicial review,\u201d and that \u201cCongress ... explicitly \nprovided for judicial review of CAT orders.\u201d  Id. at 635.  \n\u201cAn interpretation that forecloses review of CAT or-\nders cannot stand; it directly contradicts the presump-\ntion of review, a presumption supported by the lan-\nguage of the [Immigration and Nationality Act].\u201d  Id.   \n\u201cBased on the statutory language, structure, and \ncontext of \u00a7 1252,\u201d the Seventh Circuit held that it had \njurisdiction to hear the petition and proceed to the \nmerits because petitioner filed his petition within 30 \ndays of the completion of his CAT proceedings.  Id. at \n637-38.  \u201cOnly when those [CAT] proceedings con-\nclude, if the noncitizen is eligible for that review, has \nthe agency finalized all mandatory review and \u2018fully \ndetermined\u2019 the noncitizen\u2019s fate.\u201d  Id. \nThe Sixth Circuit, in an opinion by Judge Gib-\nbons, also rejected the Second Circuit\u2019s conclusion in \nBhaktibhai-Patel that Nasrallah and Guzman Chavez \n\n24 \npreclude review of the BIA\u2019s denial of withholding-\nonly relief.  Kolov, 78 F.4th at 918.  The court empha-\nsized that its prior precedent was fully in line with \nNasrallah and Guzman Chavez.  Id. at 918-19.  The \nSixth Circuit had, even before Guzman Chavez, \u201cre-\njected the argument that the phrase \u2018administratively \nfinal\u2019\u201d\u2014the text that Guzman Chavez interpreted\u2014\n\u201cmeant the same thing as the phrase \u2018final order of \nremoval\u2019 (the phrase in \u00a7 1252(a)(1) that concerns ju-\ndicial review).\u201d  Id. at 919 (citation omitted).  The \ncourt therefore adhered to its prior precedent holding \nthat \u201can order about withholding of removal functions \nas a reviewable final order because such relief could \nforeclose an avenue of deportation if granted,\u201d and \nconcluded that \u201c[t]hese holdings are not clearly incon-\nsistent with Nasrallah and [Guzman Chavez] and \ntherefore remain binding.\u201d  Id. (citation omitted).  In \na concurrence, Judge Murphy explained various com-\nplications arising from Nasrallah and Guzman \nChavez.  He agreed \u201cwe should continue to follow our \ncurrent approach,\u201d but called for \u201cthe Supreme Court \nto decide\u201d the real consequences of its recent deci-\nsions.  Id. at 929 (Murphy, J., concurring). \nIn the Fifth Circuit, a panel that had originally \nchosen to follow Bhaktibhai-Patel subsequently re-\nheard the matter and reversed its own decision, com-\ning into line with the majority of circuits noted above.  \nArgueta-Hernandez v. Garland, 73 F.4th 300 (5th Cir. \n2023) (dismissing petition for lack of jurisdiction), \nwithdrawn and superseded, 87 F.4th 698 (5th Cir. \n2023).  The court then accepted its jurisdiction over a \npetition filed within 30 days after the BIA\u2019s decision \nin a withholding-only case, and the court reversed the \nBIA\u2019s decision.  87 F.4th at 714.   \n\n25 \nThe Ninth and Tenth Circuits share this view \nabout finality in withholding-only proceedings. \nAlonso-Juarez, 80 F.4th at 1056 (holding that the Sec-\ntion 1252(b)(1) 30-day deadline was not triggered un-\ntil the conclusion of withholding-only proceedings); \nArostegui-Maldonado, 75 F.4th at 1143 (holding the \nsame). \nIn the Third Circuit, dueling unpublished opin-\nions have decided the issue both ways.  Compare \nFarooq v. Att\u2019y Gen., No. 20-2950, 2023 WL 1813597 \n(3d Cir. Feb. 8, 2023) (concluding Section 1252(b)(i)'s \nfiling deadline runs from the date of the removal order \neven though withholding-only proceedings continue), \nwith Duenas v. Att\u2019y Gen., No. 22-3024, 2023 WL \n6442601 (3d Cir. Oct. 3, 2023) (holding the deadline \nbegins to run only when withholding-only proceedings \nare complete). \nThis split, too, will not disappear on its own.  The \nquestion is complex and challenging\u2014witness the \nfacts that a Fifth Circuit panel reversed itself, two \nThird Circuit panels reached opposite conclusions, \nand the Fourth Circuit denied rehearing by a vote of \neight to six\u2014and that complexity is impeding the \nemergence of a consensus view.  The Fourth Circuit, \nhaving considered and rejected an en banc rehearing \nin Martinez, is not likely to undertake that process \nany time soon.  Meanwhile, the Seventh Circuit care-\nfully assessed the reasoning of the Second and Fourth \nCircuits, and came to a different view with full aware-\nness of the split.  The Sixth Circuit reviewed the same \ndecisions, Nasrallah and Guzman Chavez, that moti-\nvated the Second and Fourth Circuits, and it reached \na contrary conclusion precisely because Guzman \nChavez aligned with its precedents.  Because courts \n\n26 \n \non both sides of the split have entrenched and con-\ntrary views, the Court\u2019s guidance is needed to bring \nthe circuits into alignment.   \nII.   THE QUESTIONS PRESENTED ARE \nIMPORTANT. \nThe questions presented are also of great practical \nimportance. \nThe Court has repeatedly emphasized the im-\nportance of \u201cbring[ing] some discipline to the use of \nth[e] term jurisdictional\u201d when it comes to procedural \nrules imposed by Congress, and for good reason.  Hen-\nderson, 562 U.S. at 435; Santos-Zacaria, 598 U.S. at \n421.  \u201cHarsh consequences attend the jurisdictional \nbrand.\u201d  Fort Bend County v. Davis, 587 U.S. ____, 139 \nS. Ct. 1843, 1849, 204 L.Ed.2d 116 (2019) (alteration \nand internal quotation marks omitted).  \u201c[B]ecause \ncourts are not able to exceed limits on their adjudica-\ntive authority, they cannot grant equitable exceptions \nto jurisdictional rules.\u201d  Santos-Zacaria, 598 U.S. at \n416.  \u201cJurisdictional objections,\u201d by contrast, \u201ccan be \nraised at any time in the litigation,\u201d and \u201ccourts must \nenforce jurisdictional rules sua sponte, even in the \nface of a litigant's forfeiture or waiver.\u201d  Id.   \nRiley\u2019s case is a striking example of such harsh \nconsequences.  The government sought to waive the \nSection 1252(b)(1) deadline and permit the court to \nreach the merits of Riley\u2019s petition.  Gov\u2019t C.A. 28(j) \nLtr. (Aug. 14, 2023), 1-2.  The Fourth Circuit could not \naccept such a waiver because it considers the deadline \na jurisdictional rule.  App., infra, 4a.  This sort of sit-\nuation is why the Court \u201cadopted [its] clear-statement \nprinciple in Arbaugh \u2018to leave the ball in Congress\u2019 \n\n27 \n \ncourt,\u2019 [thereby] ensuring that courts impose harsh ju-\nrisdictional consequences only when Congress unmis-\ntakably has so instructed.\u201d Santos-Zacaria, 598 U.S. \nat 416-17. \nThe current uncertainty over Section 1252(b)(1) \nrisks \u201cunfair prejudice\u201d to litigants.  Henderson, 562 \nU.S. at 434.  Litigants need to know whether the gov-\nernment\u2019s waiver is effective.  Arbaugh, 546 U.S. at \n514-516; Union Pac. R.R. Co. v. Bhd. of Locomotive \nEng\u2019rs, 558 U.S. 67 (2009).  Conversely, litigants who \nwish to waive their own arguments may be prejudiced \nif they are unexpectedly or unnecessarily forbidden \nfrom doing so.  Government agencies may often wish \nto waive statutory requirements for efficiency or pol-\nicy reasons, as occurred in the proceedings below.  See \nSebelius v. Auburn Reg\u2019l Med. Ctr., 568 U.S. 145, 154 \n(2013); Weinberger v. Salfi, 422 U.S. 749, 766 (1975).   \nAs for the second question presented\u2014when Sec-\ntion 1252(b)(1)\u2019s 30-day deadline starts in withhold-\ning-only cases\u2014the \u201cdecision regarding when an order \nof removal becomes final will determine what can be \nreviewed.\u201d  F.J.A.P., 94 F.4th at 635.  The Second Cir-\ncuit and Fourth Circuit\u2019s interpretation of Section \n1252(b)(1) bars judicial review for CAT claims from a \nwide range of individuals.  Perversely, these are gen-\nerally the very people for whom such CAT relief is \nlikely to be most important, because they are ineligi-\nble for other forms of relief from removal.  The irony \nis harsh:  If a person cannot receive relief under do-\nmestic immigration policies, the CAT may be the only \navenue available to save the person from facing tor-\nture or death in the country of origin.  But that ineli-\ngibility channels the person into withholding-only \nproceedings, and thereby, in the Second and Fourth \n\n28 \nCircuits, ensures the person will not be able to present \nthat CAT claim to a court.  This outcome is the oppo-\nsite of Nasrallah\u2019s observation, that \u201cit makes some \nsense that Congress would provide an opportunity for \njudicial review\u201d given that \u201cfactual issues may be crit-\nical to determining whether the noncitizen is likely to \nbe tortured if returned.\u201d  590 U.S. at 586.   \nRiley will be killed if he is forced back to Jamaica, \nand the judicial review process is supposed to be a key \npart of the mechanism ensuring the United States \ndoes not cause that result.  People like the Martinez \nand Bhaktibhai-Patel petitioners return to the United \nStates to escape torture or death in their countries of \norigin, and that chain of events is precisely what \nblocks them from judicial review of their claims to pre-\nvent the torture. \nIf a petition for review of an order denying with-\nholding or deferral of removal pursuant to the CAT \nmust be filed within 30 days of a FARO or reinstate-\nment order, judicial review may be foreclosed for \nmany CAT claims.  This outcome is in tension with the \nobligations of the United States under the CAT, an in-\nternational treaty, and with Congress's evident in-\ntent.  As Judge St. Eve observed in F.J.A.P., \u201cCon-\ngress did not explicitly foreclose judicial review of \nCAT orders,\u201d and the Court in Nasrallah refused to \n\u201cinterpret the statute to do so implicitly.\u201d  94 F.4th at \n631. \u201cIn fact, Nasrallah very clearly grounds its intent\nin \u00a7 1252(a)(4) that CAT orders be subject to judicial\nreview.\u201d  Id.  As things currently stand, noncitizens\ndealing with Section 1252(b)(1)\u2019s deadline face uncer-\ntainty as to when they need to file a petition for review\n\n29 \nwith the court of appeals, and their ability to seek ju-\ndicial review of a denial of CAT relief depends on the \nvicissitude of where the government detains them.4  \nResolving when Section 1252(b)(1)\u2019s 30-day dead-\nline starts is also important to further Congress\u2019s in-\ntention to ensure an efficient and streamlined process \nfor judicial review of CAT orders.  Under the Second \nCircuit and Fourth Circuit\u2019s interpretation of \n1252(b)(1), \u201c[p]reserving review of CAT claims\u201d in \nwithholding-only cases \u201cwould require noncitizens to \nfile premature and incomplete petitions seeking re-\nview of not-yet-complete withholding proceedings in \norder to meet \u00a7 1252(b)(1)'s 30-day filing deadline.\u201d  \nF.J.A.P., 94 F.4th at 636.  This outcome contravenes \nthe purpose of Section 1252(b)(9)\u2019s \u201czipper clause,\u201d \nwhich is supposed to \u201cconsolidate[] [the court of ap-\npeals\u2019] review of withholding proceedings with [its] re-\nview of final orders of removal.\u201d  Id. at 635.  Similar \nto other cases decided by the Court, such a \u201cscheme \nrequiring \u2018conscientious defense attorneys\u2019 to file un-\nripe suits \u2018would add to the burden imposed on courts, \napplicants, and the States, with no clear advantage to \nany.\u2019\u201d  McDonough v. Smith, 588 U.S.109, 121 (2019) \n(quoting Panetti v. Quarterman, 551 U.S. 930, 943 \n(2007)).  These premature petitions would have to sit \nwith the courts, unresolved, pending the resolution of \nadministrative proceedings, because Congress in-\nstructed that a court \u201cmay review a final order of re-\nmoval\u201d only if the noncitizen has \u201cexhausted all ad-\nministrative remedies available as of right.\u201d  8 U.S.C. \n4 The petition for judicial review must be filed in the circuit \nwhere the IJ\u2019s hearing took place.  8 U.S.C. 1252(b)(2). \n\n30 \n \n1252(d)(1)\u2014including the BIA\u2019s decision on a claim for \nwithholding or deferral of removal.     \nThe current uncertainty on this issue is likely to \nfurther increase the substantial number of petitions \nfor review filed with the courts of appeals.  In the Sec-\nond and Fourth Circuits, and any circuits that have \nnot yet issued a clear opinion on this issue, CAT ap-\nplicants facing removal under 8 U.S.C. 1228 or in re-\ninstatement proceedings must file petitions for review \nbefore they finish withholding-only proceedings to try \nto preserve judicial review of their as-yet adjudicated \nCAT claims.  Even those in favorable circuits may \nchoose to file unripe petitions for review before the \nresolution of their CAT claims as a precautionary \nmeasure.  Removing this uncertainty by deciding the \nquestions presented will avoid adding yet more bur-\nden to an already overtaxed immigration system. \nIII.  THIS CASE IS AN IDEAL VEHICLE \nTO RESOLVE THE QUESTION. \nThis case presents an ideal vehicle to address the \nquestions presented.   \nThe Fourth Circuit\u2019s two rulings regarding juris-\ndiction are the only obstacle preventing Riley from re-\nceiving judicial review of the merits of his CAT claim.  \nIn the proceedings below, the government argued that \nthe \u201c30-day deadline is mandatory but not jurisdic-\ntional,\u201d and requested that the Fourth Circuit treat \n\u201cpetitions for review filed following the completion of \nwithholding-only proceedings a[s] timely and review-\nable.\u201d  Gov't C.A. 28(j) Ltr. (Aug. 14, 2023), 1-2.  Thus, \nif the Court finds that Section 1252(b)(1) is a jurisdic-\ntional rule and can therefore be waived, the govern-\nment has already waived Section 1252(b)(1) as a bar \n\n31 \n \nand requested that the Fourth Circuit reach the mer-\nits of Riley\u2019s petition.   \nRiley\u2019s case is also an ideal vehicle to address the \nsecond question presented\u2014whether a petition for re-\nview filed within 30 days of the completion of with-\nholding-only proceedings is timely under Section \n1252(b)(1).  Riley\u2019s withholding-only proceedings were \ncomplete on May 31, 2022, when the BIA reversed the \nIJ\u2019s prior grant of CAT relief and ordered Riley re-\nmoved from the United States to Jamaica.  App., in-\nfra, 13a-14a.  Riley then filed his petition for review \nwith the Fourth Circuit on June 3, 2022, only 3 days \nafter completion of the withholding-only proceedings.  \nApp., infra, 3a.  His petition to the Fourth Circuit was \ntimely under Section 1252(b)(1) if the Court deter-\nmines that the 30-day deadline began to run upon the \ncompletion of withholding-only proceedings (in line \nwith the majority of courts in the split).   \nThus, resolution of either question presented in \nRiley\u2019s favor would provide him substantial relief. \nAnd if Section 1252(b)(1) had not blocked Riley\u2019s \npetition, he presents a strong case on the merits.  The \nIJ, the primary factfinder, found him credible and de-\ntermined he was entitled to CAT relief.  The Fourth \nCircuit necessarily recognized Riley had shown a sig-\nnificant likelihood of success on the merits, a showing \nthat Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 434 (2009), re-\nquired for the Fourth Circuit to stay Riley\u2019s removal. \nThe questions presented recur in two primary \ntypes of cases:  when a noncitizen faces a statutory bar \nto cancellation of removal due to a prior conviction, \nand when a noncitizen faces a procedural bar on con-\ntesting removability, because of a prior removal order.  \n\n32 \nThe statutory barriers to contesting overall removal, \nin these two situations, and the initial orders of re-\nmoval, are different, though the resulting withhold-\ning-only adjudication then occur under the same reg-\nulations and process.  Riley\u2019s case is an ideal exemplar \nof the first category, and presents a ripe vehicle for the \nCourt \nto \naddress \nthe \napplication \nof \nSection \n1252(b)(1)'s 30-day deadline for this category. \nIV.\nTHE FOURTH CIRCUIT\u2019S DECISION\nWAS INCORRECT.\nThe Fourth Circuit was wrong to hold (i) that Sec-\ntion 1252(b)(1) is a jurisdictional rule, as opposed to a \nmandatory processing rule that can be waived; and (ii) \nthat Section 1252(b)(1)\u2019s 30-day deadline begins to \nrun before the conclusion of agency withholding-only \nproceedings. \nA. Congress did not clearly state that\nSection 1252(b)(1) is a jurisdic-\ntional rule.\nThe Fourth Circuit based its holding that Section \n1252(b)(1) is a jurisdictional rule on Stone, 514 U.S. at \n405, and prior Fourth Circuit precedent relying on \nStone.  App., infra, 4a; Martinez, 86 F.4th at 566-67. \nStone, and the Fourth Circuit cases, did not engage in \nthe more \u201cdisciplined\u201d approach the Court has di-\nrected lower courts to use when assessing whether a \nrule is truly jurisdictional.  Santos-Zacaria, 598 U.S. \nat 421 (explaining that Stone predated the Court\u2019s \nmore recent jurisprudence that has \u201ctried ... to bring \nsome discipline to the use of the term jurisdictional\u201d) \n(citation omitted).   \n\n33 \nThe Court has repeatedly clarified since Stone, \nand as recently as a few weeks ago, that \u201cmost time \nbars are nonjurisdictional,\u201d and that \u201cthis Court will \n\u2018treat a procedural requirement as jurisdictional only \nif Congress clearly states that it is.\u201d Harrow v. Dep\u2019t \nof Def., 601 U.S. ____, 144 S. Ct. 1178 (2024) (citations \nomitted); see also Santos-Zacaria, 598 U.S. at 416 \n(same); United States v. Wong, 575 U.S. 402, 410 \n(2015) (same). The Court further stated in Santos-\nZacaria that Stone is no longer dispositive as to \nwhether judicial review provisions, like Section \n1252(b)(1), are jurisdictional rules.  598 U.S. at 421. \nThe Ninth Circuit and Fifth Circuit are the only \ncircuits to have engaged in a disciplined textual anal-\nysis of Section 1252(b)(1) since Santos-Zacaria, and \nboth have held that the Court\u2019s analysis in Santos-\nZacaria of Section 1252\u2019s separate exhaustion provi-\nsion demonstrates that Section 1252(b)(1) is not a ju-\nrisdictional rule.  Alonso-Juarez, 80 F.4th at 1056; Ar-\ngueta-Hernandez, 87 F.4th at 705.  Santos-Zacaria, \nobserved that, unlike Section 1252(d)(1)\u2019s exhaustion \nprovision, Congress spoke in plain jurisdictional \nterms elsewhere in Section 1252.  Id. at 418.  In other \nprovisions of Section 1252, Congress specified that \u201cno \ncourt shall have jurisdiction\u201d to review certain mat-\nters.  Id. at 418-19 & n.5 (citing 8 U.S.C. 1252(a)(2)(A), \n(a)(2)(B), (a)(2)(C), (b)(9), (g)).  Section 1252(d)(1)\u2019s ex-\nhaustion provision contains no such jurisdictional lan-\nguage, and the contrast confirms that Section \n1252(d)(1) is not a jurisdictional rule.  Id. at 419.   \nSection 1252(b)(1)\u2019s 30-day deadline provision \n\u201csuffers from the same flaw\u201d as Section 1252(d)(1)\u2019s \nexhaustion provision.  Alonso-Juarez, 80 F.4th at \n1047; Argueta-Hernandez, 87 F.4th at 705.  Section \n\n34 \n1252(b)(1)\u2019s deadline is in the same statute as the ex-\nhaustion provision that the Court considered non-ju-\nrisdictional in Santos-Zacaria, and it also lacks \nplainly jurisdictional language.  Id.  Consequently, \nthe reasoning of Santos-Zacaria leads to the same \nconclusion about Section 1252(b)(1), namely that it is \nno more jurisdictional than Section 1252(d)(1).   \nEven the Fourth, Seventh, and Eleventh Circuits \nhave acknowledged that \u201cSantos-Zacaria v. Garland \ncalled the jurisdictionality of \u00a7 1252(b)(1) into ques-\ntion.\u201d  F.J.A.P., 94 F.4th at 626; Martinez, 86 F.4th at \n574 (Floyd, J., concurring in the judgment) (noting \nthat Santos-Zacaria \u201ccast[s] doubt on our characteri-\nzation of the deadline as \u2018jurisdictional\u2019\u201d and \u201cstrongly \nsuggests\u201d the 30-day deadline is a claims-processing \nrule); Allen, 2024 WL 164403, at *2 (\u201c[T]the Supreme \nCourt\u2019s reasoning in Santos-Zacaria may be at odds \nwith our reasoning in [prior precedent].\u201d).  They treat \nSection 1252(b)(1) as jurisdictional not because that is \nthe correct approach, but because they think Stone \nmandates that treatment and \u201cuntil Stone is over-\nturned by the Court itself, we must continue to apply \nit.\u201d  F.J.A.P., 94 F.4th at 626.   \nThe primary rationale of Stone was a principle \nstated back then, that \u201cstatutory provisions specifying \nthe timing of review \u2026 are, \u2026 \u2018mandatory and juris-\ndictional.\u2019\u201d  514 U.S. at 405.  The Court has repeatedly \nand explicitly rejected that premise.  \u201cCourts will \u2026 \nnot assume that in creating a mundane claims-pro-\ncessing rule, Congress made it \u2018unique in our adver-\nsarial system\u2019 by allowing parties to raise it at any \ntime and requiring courts to consider it sua sponte.\u201d  \nWilkins v. United States, 598 U.S. 152, 158 (2023).  \nAbsent the now-discarded presumption animating \n\n35 \n \nStone, and absent any textual indications that Section \n1252(b)(1) was meant to limit jurisdiction, the Fourth \nCircuit\u2019s categorization of the provision cannot stand. \nB. Section 1252(b)(1)\u2019s 30-day dead-\nline does not start until the comple-\ntion of withholding proceedings. \nThe Fourth Circuit concluded that the FARO is-\nsued to Riley was the only \u201cfinal order of removal\u201d in \nthe case, and because the FARO was the beginning of \nthe process, it necessarily occurred more than 30 days \nbefore the BIA decision for which Riley sought review.  \nApp., infra, 4a-5a.  \nThe statute itself precludes this outcome.  It bars \njudicial review until the noncitizen has exhausted all \navailable \nadministrative \nremedies. \n \n8 \nU.S.C. \n1252(d)(1).  The orders issued in the case cannot be \n\u201cfinal\u201d if there are administrative proceedings still to \nbe completed.  Consistent with that view, the defini-\ntion of \u201corder of deportation\u201d says such an order is not \n\u201cfinal\u201d until the BIA issues its decision (or the time to \nappeal to the BIA has elapsed).  8 U.S.C. 1101(47)(B).   \nThe Fourth Circuit considers its conclusion man-\ndated by Nasrallah and Guzman Chavez.  But neither \ncase interpreted the meaning of \u201cfinality\u201d under Sec-\ntion 1252(b)(1).  Indeed, the Court explicitly warned \nlower courts that it was not deciding the issue.  See \nGuzman Chavez, 594 U.S. at 535 n.6; Nasrallah, 590 \nU.S. at 585 (warning courts to not read its decision as \n\u201caffect[ing] the authority of the courts of appeals to re-\nview CAT orders\u201d).  While Guzman Chavez held that \na reinstated order of removal is \u201cadministratively fi-\nnal\u201d for detention purposes under 8 U.S.C. 1231, Con-\ngress\u2019s use of the word \u201cadministratively\u201d in section \n\n36 \n1231 distinguishes it from a \u201cfinal order\u201d for judicial \nreview purposes in Section 1252.  594 U.S. at 534 (\u201cBy \nusing the word \u2018administratively,\u2019 Congress focused \nour attention on the agency\u2019s review proceedings, sep-\narate and apart from any judicial review proceedings \nthat may occur in a court.\u201d). \nThe statutory language, structure, and context of \nSection 1252 all indicate \u201cfinal order\u201d in Section 1252 \nhas a meaning different from \u201cadministratively final\u201d \nfor purposes of detention under Section 1231.  The \u201cor-\ndinary, contemporary, [and] common meaning\u201d of \u201cfi-\nnal\u201d indicates that it is \u201cthe last stage in the process; \nleaving nothing to be looked for or expected.\u201d  F.J.A.P., \n94 F.4th at 634 (citations omitted).    \u201c[A]lthough a \nCAT order does not determine whether a noncitizen \ncan be removed, it does determine where that nonciti-\nzen can be sent,\u201d and \u201c[t]he indeterminacy of where, \nwhile CAT proceedings are pending, suggests that the \nreinstated order might yet leave something \u2018to be \nlooked for or expected,\u2019 subject to possible alteration.\u201d  \nId.  (citations omitted).  The same is true for a FARO, \nwhich, despite the word \u201cfinal\u201d in its title, actually \nmarks the beginning, not the end, of a process to de-\ncide if the removal will be carried out as ordered. \n\u201c[T]he plain meaning of \u2018final\u2019 points us toward the \nconclusion\u201d that an order \u201cdoes not become final for \npurposes of judicial review until the agency has also \nconcluded withholding proceedings.\u201d  Id. \nBoth Judge St. Eve and Judge Murphy have \npointed out that this interpretation also tracks the or-\ndinary understanding of \u201cfinality.\u201d  Black\u2019s Law Dic-\ntionary defines final as \u201clast; conclusive; definitive; \nterminated; completed;\u201d and in reference to legal ac-\ntions, \u201ca judgment is \u2018final\u2019 if no further judicial action \n\n37 \n\u2026 is required.\u201d  F.J.A.P., 94 F.4th at 634 (quoting \nBlack\u2019s Law Dictionary 6th ed. 1990).  \u201c[P]erhaps we \nshould interpret the word \u2018final\u2019 in the judicial-review \nprovision against the background of the final-judg-\nment rule\u2014which presumes that there will be one ap-\npeal at the end of proceedings rather than many ap-\npeals in \u2018fits and starts\u2019 after each order.\u201d  Kolov, 78 \nF.4th 911 at 928 (J. Murphy, concurring) (citation\nomitted).  \u201cAlthough the noncitizen has been deter-\nmined deportable\u201d in the case of a reinstatement order\nor a FARO, \u201cthe agency\u2019s work is not completed, and\nit may not remove the noncitizen until agency with-\nholding review is complete.\u201d  F.J.A.P., 94 F.4th at 634\n(citing 8 C.F.R. 1208.5(a) (explaining that a noncitizen\ncannot be removed \u201cbefore a decision is rendered on\nhis or her ... application\u201d)).  Thus, the final decision in\na noncitizen\u2019s withholding-only proceedings reflect\nthat the agency is finished, at which time Section\n1252(b)(1)\u2019s deadline begins to run.\nThis reading of the statute also respects the pre-\nsumption that Congress intends judicial review.  \nSmith v. Berryhill, 587 U.S. ____, 139 S. Ct. 1765, \n1776, 204 L.Ed.2d 62 (2019).  This presumption ap-\nplies equally to the reviewability of immigration stat-\nutes.  Guerrero-Lasprilla v. Barr, 589 U.S. 221, 228-\n231 (2020).  Congress itself also explicitly provided for \njudicial review of CAT orders.  Nasrallah, 590 U.S. at \n585-586 (explaining that section 2242(d) of FARRA\ngranted jurisdiction to review CAT claims along with\nremoval orders).  Section 1252(a)(4), enacted as part\nof the 2005 Real ID Act, further confirmed the author-\nity of the courts of appeals to review CAT orders.  Id.\n\u201cIt would be easy enough for Congress to limit judicial\nreview of CAT orders, just as Congress has limited ju-\n\n38 \ndicial review of reinstated orders of removal to a nar-\nrow set of questions.  But Congress has not done so.\u201d  \nF.J.A.P., 94 F.4th at 637 (citing Nasrallah, 590 U.S. \nat 583). \nSantos-Zacaria further bolsters this interpreta-\ntion.  While Santos-Zacaria dealt with a different Im-\nmigration and Nationality Act provision, that the \nCourt did not mention Section 1252(b)(1)\u2019s filing dead-\nline when discussing jurisdiction is suggestive.  598 \nU.S. at 414-417.  After the government reinstated \nSantos-Zacaria's removal order, she filed a petition for \nreview in the Fifth Circuit more than 30 days after the \nreinstatement of that order but within 30 days of the \nconclusion of withholding proceedings.  However, \nwhen deciding Santos-Zacaria, the Court never raised \nthe issue of jurisdiction as it must if there is a juris-\ndictional problem.  While not dispositive, Santos-Zac-\naria at a minimum suggests that the majority inter-\npretation of Section 1252(b)(1)\u2019s 30-day deadline is \ncorrect\u2014\u201c[o]nly when [withholding] proceedings con-\nclude, if the noncitizen is eligible for that review, has \nthe agency finalized all mandatory review and \u2018fully \ndetermined\u2019 the noncitizen\u2019s fate\u201d under Section \n1252(b)(1).  F.J.A.P., 94 F.4th at 637 (citation omit-\nted).   \nThe Court should grant certiorari to make clear \nthat although the portion of an order that discusses \nCAT relief is not in itself an \u201corder of removal,\u201d the \n\u201corder of removal\u201d does not become \u201cfinal\u201d for pur-\nposes of Section 1252(b)(1), thus starting a 30-day \ndeadline for review, until the conclusion of agency pro-\nceedings including the BIA\u2019s decision regarding CAT \nrelief. \n\n39 \nCONCLUSION \nThe Court should grant the petition. \nRespectfully submitted. \nKEITH BRADLEY \n   Counsel of Record \nKAYLA MARIE MENDEZ \n717 17th Street, Suite 1825 \nDenver, CO 80202 \n(303) 830-1776\nkeith.bradley@squirepb.com\nJEFFREY WALKER \n2000 Huntington Center, \n41 South High Street \nColumbus, OH 43215 \nELIZABETH F.

GARLAND, ATTORNEY GENERAL, \nRespondent.\nOn Petition for Review of an Order of the \nBoard of Immigration Appeals.\nMarch 27, 2024, Submitted; \nApril 26, 2024, Decided\nBefore KING, HARRIS, and QUATTLEBAUM, Circuit \nJudges.\nPetition dismissed by unpublished per curiam opinion.\nUnpublished opinions are not binding precedent in this \ncircuit.\n\nAppendix A\n2a\nPER CURIAM:\nPierre Yassue Nashun Riley, a native and citizen of \nJamaica, petitions for review of an order of the Board of \nImmigration Appeals (\u201cBoard\u201d) vacating the Immigration \nJudge\u2019s (\u201cIJ\u201d) order granting Riley\u2019s application for \ndeferral of removal under the Convention Against Torture \n(\u201cCAT\u201d) and ordering Riley removed to Jamaica. Because \nwe lack jurisdiction over Riley\u2019s petition for review, we \ndismiss it.\nI.\nRiley entered the United States in 1995 on a tourist \nvisa. In 2006, a federal grand jury returned an indictment \ncharging Riley with conspiracy to distribute and possess \nwith intent to distribute 1000 kilograms or more of \nmarijuana and possession of a firearm in furtherance of a \ndrug-trafficking crime. A jury found Riley guilty of both \noffenses, and he was sentenced to 25 years\u2019 imprisonment. \nIn January 2021, Riley was granted compassionate \nrelease.\nJust after Riley\u2019s release from federal prison, the \nimmigration authorities took custody of him. On January \n26, 2021, the Department of Homeland Security issued \na Final Administrative Removal Order, explaining that \nRiley was removable because he had been convicted of an \naggravated felony. See 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1228(b). Riley expressed \na fear of returning to Jamaica, and an immigration officer \nconducted a reasonable fear interview. The immigration \nofficer determined that Riley had not established a \n\nAppendix A\n3a\nreasonable fear of persecution or torture in Jamaica, but \nan IJ disagreed and referred Riley to the immigration \ncourt for withholding-only proceedings.\nRiley appeared with counsel before the IJ and \nconceded removability under \u00a7 1228(b). Although Riley \napplied for asylum, statutory withholding of removal, \nand both withholding of removal and deferral of removal \nunder CAT, he later conceded that he was eligible only for \ndeferral of removal under CAT given his prior convictions.\nAfter an evidentiary hearing, the IJ granted Riley\u2019s \napplication for deferral of removal under CAT. The \nDepartment of Homeland Security appealed the IJ\u2019s \ndecision to the Board, and a three-member panel of \nthe Board issued a May 31, 2022, unpublished decision \nsustaining the appeal. That is, the Board vacated the \nIJ\u2019s order granting relief and ordered Riley removed to \nJamaica.\nOn June 3, 2022, Riley petitioned this court for review \nof the Board\u2019s decision. We later placed this appeal in \nabeyance for the issuance of the mandate in Martinez v. \nGarland, No. 22-1221 (4th Cir.). The mandate in Martinez \nhas issued, and so Riley\u2019s case has been removed from \nabeyance.\n\nAppendix A\n4a\nII.\nA.\n\u201cWe have an independent obligation to assure ourselves \nof jurisdiction to decide an appeal.\u201d Martinez v. Garland, \n86 F.4th 561, 566 (4th Cir. 2023). We generally possess \njurisdiction to review \u201ca final order of removal.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1252(a)(1). A noncitizen must petition for review within \n30 days \u201cof the final order of removal.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)\n(1). \u201cThe 30-day deadline is mandatory and jurisdictional \nand is not subject to equitable tolling.\u201d Martinez, 86 F.4th \nat 566 (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201c[O]nce we have \na final order of removal before us, we can consider along \nwith it \u2018all questions of law and fact . . . arising from any \naction taken or proceeding brought to remove [the] alien \nfrom the United States.\u2019\u201d Id. (quoting 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)\n(9)) (ellipsis and second alteration in original).\nRiley seeks review of the Board\u2019s order vacating \nthe IJ\u2019s order and denying his application for deferral \nof removal under CAT. We recently held in Martinez, \nhowever, that an order denying CAT relief is not a final \norder of removal for purposes of \u00a7 1252(a)(1). Id. at 567. \nSo for us to exercise jurisdiction over the Board\u2019s order \ndenying CAT relief, Riley \u201cmust identify another eligible \norder\u201d that is properly before us. Id. But Riley cannot \ndo so because he did not timely petition for review of \na final order of removal. That is, Riley did not petition \nfor review within 30 days of the January 26, 2021, Final \nAdministrative Removal Order. So there is no final order \nof removal properly in front of us that would allow us to \n\nAppendix A\n5a\nreview the Board\u2019s order denying CAT relief. We thus \nlack jurisdiction over Riley\u2019s petition for review. Id. at 571.\nB.\nRiley offers several arguments in favor of our \nexercise of jurisdiction, but none convinces us. To start, \nRiley contends that Martinez should not control in this \ncase because it involves a Final Administrative Order of \nRemoval issued under \u00a7 1228(b), not a reinstated removal \norder, which Martinez addressed. But Riley offers no \npersuasive justification for differentiating between those \ntwo types of orders when applying the jurisdictional \nprinciples delineated in Martinez, and we discern no \nreason to do so.\nRiley next argues that the Final Administrative Order \nof Removal was not actually final for purposes of \u00a7 1252(a)\n(1) because he applied for asylum. Riley was statutorily \nineligible for asylum, however, and he effectively withdrew \nhis asylum application during his merits hearing. See 8 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(2)(A)(ii), (B)(i). Because Riley could not \nhave obtained asylum relief, his asylum application did \nnot impact his removability. The Final Administrative \nOrder of Removal was thus in fact final despite Riley\u2019s \nasylum application.\nFinally, Riley maintains that we may exercise \njurisdiction over the Board\u2019s order affirming the denial \nof CAT relief under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(4) (\u201c[A] petition \nfor review filed with an appropriate court of appeals in \naccordance with this section shall be the sole and exclusive \n\nAppendix A\n6a\nmeans for judicial review of any cause or claim under \n[CAT.]\u201d). But that provision means only that we may \nreview an order denying CAT relief as part of our review \nof a final order of removal. It does not authorize us to \nreview an order denying CAT relief without a final order \nof removal properly before us. See Nasrallah v. Barr, \n140 S. Ct. 1683, 1691, 207 L. Ed. 2d 111 (2020) (citing \u00a7 \n1252(a)(4) and explaining that order denying CAT relief \nis reviewable \u201cas part of the review of a final order of \nremoval\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)); Martinez, \n86 F.4th at 567 (recognizing that federal appellate court \nmay review order denying CAT relief only as part of its \nreview of final order of removal); Bhaktibhai-Patel v. \nGarland, 32 F.4th 180, 190 n.13 (2d Cir. 2022) (explaining \nthat \u00a7 1252(a)(4) does not enable federal appellate court to \nexercise jurisdiction over order denying CAT relief \u201cin the \nabsence of a judicially reviewable final order of removal\u201d).\nIII.\nBecause we lack jurisdiction, we dismiss the petition \nfor review. We dispense with oral argument because the \nfacts and legal contentions are adequately presented in \nthe materials before this court and argument would not \naid the decisional process.\nPETITION DISMISSED\n\nAppendix B\n7a\nAPPENDIX B \u2014 OPINION OF THE UNITED \nSTATES DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE, \nEXECUTIVE OFFICE FOR IMMIGRATION \nREVIEW, BOARD OF IMMIGRATION APPEALS, \nFILED MAY 31, 2022\nU.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE \nEXECUTIVE OFFICE FOR IMMIGRATION \nREVIEW\nBOARD OF IMMIGRATION APPEALS\nMATTER OF:\nPIERRE YASSUE NASHUN RILEY, A097-534-840\nApplicant\nIN WITHHOLDING ONLY PROCEEDINGS\nOn Appeal from a Decision of the Immigration Court, \nArlington, VA\nBefore: Baird, Appellate Immigration Judge; Gorman, \nAppellate Immigration Judge; Wilson, Appellate \nImmigration Judge\nOpinion by Appellate Immigration Judge Wilson\nWILSON, Appellate Immigration Judge\nThe Department of Homeland Security (\u201cDHS\u201d) has \nappealed from an Immigration Judge\u2019s July 27, 2021, \ndecision granting the applicant\u2019s request for protection \nunder the regulations implementing the Convention \n\nAppendix B\n8a\nAgainst Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d).1 The applicant, a native and \ncitizen of Jamaica, has filed responses in opposition to \nDHS\u2019 appeal.

Treaty \nDoc. No. 100-20, 1465 U.N.T.S. 85 (entered into force for United \nStates Nov. 20, 1994). The applicant\u2019s attorney stated that he is \nonly applying for deferral of removal under the CAT (Tr. at 33). The \nImmigration Judge found the applicant is not eligible for asylum, \nwithholding of removal under the INA or withholding of removal \nunder the CAT because he has been convicted of a particularly \nserious crime (IJ at 6). This finding has not been contested on appeal.\n\nAppendix B\n9a\nnot that \n will harm the applicant upon his return \nto Jamaica (IJ at 9-10). In addition, the Immigration Judge \nfound that the applicant credibly testified that \n \nhas influence with the neighborhood and the police, that \nthe applicant would be forced to register with the police \nand keep them informed of his movements, which would \nallow \n to know his whereabouts and that he will \nmore likely than not be tortured with the acquiescence of \nthe government (IJ at 10).\nDHS challenges the Immigration Judge\u2019s positive \ncredibility determination (IJ at 4-6). Based on the \ndeferential clear error standard of review, we discern \nno clear error in the Immigration Judge\u2019s credibility \ndetermination and will treat the applicant\u2019s testimony as \ncredible for purposes of this appeal.\nHowever, as explained more fully below, we discern \nclear error in the Immigration Judge\u2019s factual findings \nregarding what is likely to happen to the applicant upon \nhis removal to Jamaica, and we agree with DHS that the \napplicant has not met his burden of proof to show eligibility \nfor deferral of removal under the CAT. The applicant \nbears the burden to show that it is more likely than not \nthat he would be tortured in Jamaica by, or with the \nconsent or acquiescence (to include the concept of willful \nblindness) of, a public official or an individual acting in \nan official capacity. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1208.16(c), 1208.18. The \napplicant must make two distinct showings: (i) likely \nfuture mistreatment, i.e., that it is more likely than not he \nwill endure severe pain or suffering that is intentionally \ninflicted; and (ii) that the likely future mistreatment will \n\nAppendix B\n10a\noccur at the hands of the government or with the consent \nor acquiescence of the government. Cruz-Quintanilla v. \nWhitaker, 914 F.3d 884, 886 (4th Cir. 2019). Importantly, an \napplicant cannot establish eligibility by stringing together \na series of suppositions to show that it is more likely than \nnot that torture will result where the evidence does not \nestablish that each step in the hypothetical chain of events \nis more likely than not to happen. Matter of J-F-F-, 23 \nI&N Dec. 912, 917-18 (A.G. 2006). An Immigration Judge\u2019s \nfindings regarding the likelihood of future harm and of \nacquiescence by the government (i.e., what is likely to \nhappen) are factual findings that the Board reviews for \nclear error. Whether that predicted future harm meets \nthe definition of torture and whether future governmental \nconduct meets the definition of consent or acquiescence \nare questions of law we review de novo. Turkson v. Holder, \n667 F.3d 523, 530 (4th Cir. 2012).\nDHS argues on appeal that the Immigration Judge \nerred in finding that the applicant showed he will more \nlikely than not be tortured and should have found that \nhe presented a speculative chain of events that would \nhappen to him. We agree. While the Immigration Judge \nfound that the applicant has shown a particularized risk \nof torture, this finding is based on speculative assertions \nby the respondent regarding \nThe applicant, who has been in the United States \nfor many years, claims that \n killed two of his \ncousins in Jamaica. But other than his testimony, which \nis not based on first-hand knowledge, there is no objective \ncorroborating evidence that \n killed his relatives \n\nAppendix B\n11a\nor why. Indeed, the grand jury indictment in California \nagainst \n states he was arrested on February 12, \n2010, on his way to pick up marijuana, and thus, he would \nhave been incarcerated in the United States at the time \nof the cousin\u2019s murder in 2011 (Exh. 6D). When asked \nhow he knows \n killed his cousins, he stated that \n and his gang members \u201cbrag about this stuff\u201d \n(Tr. at 51-52). Yet, the affidavits from the applicant\u2019s \nfamily make no mention of \n (Exh. 6). Nor do \nthe affidavits from the applicant\u2019s mother, sister, and \nstepfather mention \n when describing threats \nto kill the applicant they received in 2021 (Exh. 6B). The \nmother\u2019s affidavit states she received phone calls \u201cfrom \nindividuals who live in Jamaica threatening to kill [the \napplicant] on site should he come home\u201d and that neighbors \nreported to her that three masked men asked about the \napplicant\u2019s whereabouts (Exh. 6B; Tr. at 68-69). The \napplicant\u2019s sister states in her affidavit that \u201cpeople\u201d have \nasked about him and unknown guys told her the applicant \nhas a green light on him but did not tell her why (Exh. 6B; \nTr. at 68-69). When the applicant was asked why \n \nhas any interest in harming him now and sees him as a \nthreat, the applicant testified \u201c[t]hat\u2019s the big question\u201d \nand that he will expect the applicant to retaliate against \n for his cousins\u2019 deaths because that is the \n\u201cJamaican lifestyle\u201d (Tr. at 47-48). Thus, the applicant\u2019s \nclaims that \n killed or ordered the killing of his \ncousins and is behind the threats his mother and sister \nreceived in 2021 are speculative.\nThe Immigration Judge also found that country \nconditions evidence supports the applicant\u2019s claim \n\nAppendix B\n12a\nbut cited generalized statements in the 2020 State \nDepartment Report regarding government human \nrights abuses, fatalities involving government security \nforces, allegations of torture of people in police custody, \nand insufficient action in addressing abuse and unlawful \nkillings by security forces (IJ at 8-9; Exh. 4C). The \nImmigration Judge did not explain and did not cite to \nany particular evidence of record corroborating the claim \nthat \n is an ex-police officer, that he controls the \napplicant\u2019s old neighborhood, that he killed the applicant\u2019s \nrelatives, or that he poses a particularized risk of harm to \nthe applicant that would amount to torture. The country \nconditions evidence does not mention \n and does \nnot indicate the police will acquiesce in torture. In fact, the \nevidence the applicant cites in his brief on appeal is either \ninformation about crime and safety for foreign travelers to \nJamaica or evidence indicating that crime is a significant \nproblem, but the evidence also indicates that Jamaica \nhas an independent police oversight body and that efforts \nare made to address gangs, corruption, and impunity for \npolice killings (Exh. 6 at pages 142-52, 158-64). Moreover, \nthe mother\u2019s affidavit does not demonstrate a likelihood \nof acquiescence simply because the police stated it would \nnot investigate threats from unknown persons against the \napplicant who currently is not in Jamaica (Exh. 6B). The \nmere existence of a pattern of human rights violations \nin a particular country does not constitute a sufficient \nground for finding that a person would more likely than \nnot be tortured. Nolasco v. Garland, 7 F.4th 180, 191 (4th \nCir. 2021).\n\nAppendix B\n13a\nThus, we conclude that the respondent\u2019s claim is \nbased on the stringing together of a series of suppositions \nand is not supported by sufficient objective evidence to \ncorroborate his speculative fear of torture by \n or \nthat the government will acquiesce in his torture. Matter \nof O-R-E-, 28 I&N Dec. 330, 350 (BIA 2021); Matter of \nJ-F-F-, 23 I&N Dec. at 917-18.2\nFor these reasons, we will reverse the Immigration \nJudge\u2019s determination that the applicant has demonstrated \nthat it is more likely than not that he would be subjected \nto torture inflicted by, or at the instigation of or with the \nconsent, acquiescence, or willful blindness of a Jamaican \npublic official or other person acting in an official capacity \nfor purposes of deferral of removal under the CAT.\n2.\u2002  The applicant also alleges in his reply brief that the \nImmigration Judge did not consider, in the aggregate, the likelihood \nof torture because of his status as a criminal deportee and his long-\ntime residence in the United States (Respondent\u2019s Reply Br. at 22-\n24). However, the Immigration Judge found that the applicant never \nmentioned that he fears the police directly (IJ at 7). The applicant \nstates he will be required to register with the government and wear \nan ankle monitor and cites evidence stating that criminal deportees \nare stigmatized (Exh. 6 at 263-303, 310-25). However, he has not \ncited specific evidence that police or other government officials \nsubject criminal deportees to extreme mistreatment, intentionally \ninflict torture on them, or that he personally faces a risk of torture \nby the government or with the consent or acquiescence of a public \nofficial. The evidence he cites does not mention torture of criminal \ndeportees, but rather discusses the difficulty criminal deportees \nhave reintegrating into society and the blame they experience by \nsociety and the government for rising crime rates (Exh. 6). Thus, \nwe find this claim to be without merit.\n\nAppendix B\n14a\nAccordingly, the following orders will be entered.\nORDER: The Department of Homeland Security\u2019s \nappeal is sustained.\nFURTHER ORDER: The Immigration Judge\u2019s order \ndated July 27, 2021, granting deferral of removal under \nthe CAT is vacated, and the applicant is ordered removed \nfrom the United States to Jamaica.\n\nAppendix C\n15a\nAPPENDIX C \u2014 DECISION AND ORDER OF THE \nUNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE, \nEXECUTIVE OFFICE FOR IMMIGRATION \nREVIEW, UNITED STATES IMMIGRATION \nCOURT, ARLINGTON, VIRGINIA, \nDATED JULY 27, 2021\nUNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE\nEXECUTIVE OFFICE FOR IMMIGRATION \nREVIEW\nUNITED STATES IMMIGRATION COURT\nARLINGTON, VIRGINIA\nFile: A097-534-840\nIn the Matter of\nPIERRE YASSUE NASHUN RILEY\nApplicant\nIN WITHHOLDING ONLY PROCEEDINGS\nJuly 27, 2021\nCHARGES:\nAPPLICATIONS: \t For m I- 5 89, application for \nwithholding of removal under INA \nSection 241(b)(3), and under the \nConvention against Torture.\n\nAppendix C\n16a\nORAL DECISION OF THE IMMIGRATION JUDGE\nPROCEDURAL HISTORY\nApplicant is a native and citizen of Jamaica. He \nlast entered the United States on a visitor visa in 1995; \noverstayed. While in the United States he was arrested \ntwice. First in 1998 for marijuana possession as a minor, \nyouthful offender, and then in 2006 he was convicted for \ndistribution of marijuana and possession of a firearm in \nfurtherance of that distribution and then was sentenced to \n25 years\u2019 incarceration. Fast forward to 2021, the District \nCourt Judge signed an order authorizing compassionate \nrelease, and thereafter he was placed in ICE custody \nand was ordered removed pursuant to INA Section \n238(b). And then he claimed a reasonable fear which an \nImmigration Judge found to be reasonable and placed in \nthese proceedings.\nSUMMARY OF RELEVANT TESTIMONY\nApplicant was born on March 22, 1979, native and \ncitizen of Jamaica, lived in Kingston. He did use an alias, \nAdrian Francis for ID and to get into certain bars and \nclubs, what have you. He last entered the United States \nunder his real name on February 3, 1995 and never left. \nHe testified to having distributed marijuana in the past, \nacknowledged that he was convicted and sentenced to 25 \nyears. Ultimately he was released. He said if he returned \nto Jamaica he would be tortured and killed by a man \nnamed \n\nAppendix C\n17a\nThis person, \n he is from the \nneighborhood of Central Kingston, Jamaica, same \nneighborhood as the applicant. In fact, applicant said he \nknew \n His family knew him growing up. \nApplicant said that \n took over the neighborhood \nsometime in the 2000\u2019s. He was an ex-cop, supporter of the \nJLP Party, and after he took over the neighborhood he and \nhis supporters in the neighborhood would harm people and \nproperty. Applicant testified that at one point \n \neven came to the United States but he still had contacts \nin his old neighborhood in Jamaica, including authorities. \nApplicant testified that \n was deported back to \nJamaica from the United States sometime in 2016 or \n2017. He knows because the applicant\u2019s mother and sister \nstill live in Jamaica. They have seen \n Applicant \ntestified also that \n has an issue with his family. \nHe had killed two of the applicant\u2019s cousins, a person \nnamed O\u2019Neal, as well as a person named Darrel, and \nthen threatened all male relatives which includes the \napplicant, that he would kill them or threaten to kill them \nif they return or if he sees them in Jamaica. And this is \nbecause, according to the applicant, \n feels that \nthe relatives of the two people that he murdered would \nexact revenge for the murders against \n Now, \n wants to harm the applicant because he thinks \napplicant is going to seek revenge against him.\nRegarding these two cousins who died, one was \nO\u2019Neal, he died in 2008. He was actually somewhat \nassociated with \n He used to give money to him to \npay off groups, individuals and politics. But when O\u2019Neal \nwanted to quit doing this \n killed him because he \n\nAppendix C\n18a\ntook that as a sign of disrespect. Applicant said that the \npolice did nothing to investigate or solve O\u2019Neal\u2019s murder. \nAnd in fact, when his other cousin, Darrel Scott, tried to \nget the police to investigate further, \n ordered him \nkilled, according to word on the street. That was sometime \nin March 2011. The police, according to applicant, did not \ninvestigate Darrel\u2019s death.\nThe applicant, after serving 15 years in prison, \nwas released for his marijuana distribution conviction, \nfollowing a sentence reduction. Thereafter, his mother \nstarted receiving calls threatening to harm the applicant \nif he ever returned to Jamaica. Applicant said there was \neven a car with masked men who approached applicant\u2019s \nmother looking for the applicant in Jamaica. Applicant \ntestified that his mother then went to file a police report \nbut the police told applicant\u2019s mother that the applicant \nwas not even in Jamaica as among the reasons why they \nrefused to take the report. They also knew that the report \nwas against \n Applicant said that his \nmother was even approached at work by \n himself \nand threatened that he will kill the applicant. At this \npoint the applicant told his mother to stop reporting to \nthe police for fear of being killed. He said his sister also \nreceived communication from \n in Jamaica. They \nthreatened to harm the applicant. He said that the people \nwho approached his sister said they have the green light to \nmurder the applicant from \n Applicant \nalso testified as two other individuals who live in the same \nneighborhood as he did in Jamaica both died following \ndeportation back. He said he cannot relocate anywhere \nin Jamaica because Jamaican authorities force him to \n\nAppendix C\n19a\nregister upon his return, they would know where he is. \nThat would tie directly into \n and allow \n \nto easily become aware of where the applicant is located. \nThat and the entire country of Jamaica is about the size \nof New Jersey. It is fairly small.\nCross-examination he said at the interview that he \ngrew up in a neighborhood controlled by the JLP. But \nexplained that was just a point of fact, not like a choice that \nhe was making. He also clarified that he could be killed \nas a member or for being a supporter of the JLP because \nthat is just the way people are killed in Jamaica. There is \na lot of violence; a lot of it is political. And he indicated he \ndid not mean to claim that he was a member of the JLP \nor the family was a member of the JLP.\nLAW FINDINGS, ANALYSIS, CREDIBILITY, \nCORROBORATION\nWhen testimony is offered in support of an application \nfor relief the Court must consider whether such testimony \nis credible. INA Section 240(c)(4)(B). For applications filed \nafter May 11, 2005 provisions of the REAL ID Act govern \nthe credibility analysis. Making this determination the \nCourt considers the totality of the circumstances and \nall relevant factors. See id. Section 240(c)(4)(C). Matter \nof J-Y-C-, 24 I&N Dec. 260, 262 (BIA 2007). Generally, \nto be credible, testimony shall satisfactorily explain any \nmaterial discrepancies or omissions, INA Section 240(c)\n(4)(C). The Court may base a credibility determination \non the witness\u2019s demeanor, candor, or responsiveness, the \ninherent plausibility of his account. INA Section 240(c)\n\nAppendix C\n20a\n(4)(C). Other factors include the consistency between \nwritten and oral statements without regard to whether \ninconsistency goes to the heart of the applicant\u2019s claim. \nId.; Matter of J-Y-C-, 24 I&N Dec. at 263-66.\nIn this case the Court listened carefully to the \napplicant\u2019s testimony. I observed the applicant very \ncarefully as he was answering questions, reviewed the \ndetailed affidavit and the Form I-589 as well as the \nbackground Country Reports from the Department of \nState and other background country evidence in this \ncase. Based on this Court\u2019s thorough review it will find \nthe applicant to be generally credible. The Court notes \napplicant did provide a very detailed application, Form \nI-589, affidavit. Lays out his history growing up. His \ncommission of the crime, his fear of return, who he fears \nreturn from. Harm that his family experienced as the \nbasis for his own fear. And testified in a manner that was \noverall consistent with his prior statements. The Court \nnotes that the evidence also independently corroborates \nthe identity of this individual named \n \nhis involvement with drugs, convictions here in the \nUnited States. There is a letter from family members \nthat also identify \n as being influential \nin the neighborhood having been the source of various \nthreats. There is also corroboration of the two cousins \nwho were killed, and clearly the death reports or the death \ncertificates are not going to indicate or point the finger at \nwho committed the offense. The applicant has himself filled \nin that gap at portion of the testimony to what the Court \nfinds to be credible just based on the information provided \nby the applicant, the manner in which he testified. And \n\nAppendix C\n21a\nthe Court\u2019s opinion that he was forthright and honest. He \nclarified some of the statements that he was confronted \nwith by the Government on cross-examination, namely, \nthat pertaining to questions of his involvement with the \nJLP Party or the opposition party to the JLP, initially it \nappeared that applicant was critical of the JLP Party with \nno indication that he was a member. The Government did \npoint to some questions and answers in the reasonable \nfear interview that would seem to indicate that he was \neither a member or supporter of the JLP Party. The \napplicant clarified that the way the question was asked \nand the way he answered that it was much more narrow \npoint that he was trying to make. That is that he grew up \nin a neighborhood that was controlled by the JLP Party. \nAgain, the applicant indicated that he presented this just \nas a matter of fact and not some choice that his family \nmade to join the JLP versus another party. He followed \nthat up with an explanation of his answers as to whether \nhe could be killed for being a member of the JLP Party. \nHis answer was in the affirmative, but he clarified that \nnot him as a member of the JLP Party but that this is \nwhat happens in Jamaica. Politics is violent. One could \nbe killed for simply being a member of the JLP Party or \nany other party. The Court accepts these explanations. \nThe Court notes that applicant had been in prison for 15 \nyears and is only questioned about his fear of return. It \nappears that the answers could be construed in several \ndifferent ways. The Court gives the applicant the benefit \nof the doubt and I would accept his explanations for why \nhe answers the questions in the manner he did. And with \nthat clarified the Court would find the applicant has put \nforth a credible claim.\n\nAppendix C\n22a\nDEFERRAL OF REMOVAL UNDER THE \nCONVENTION AGAINST TORTURE\nInitially, the Court notes that the applicant is not \neligible for asylum under INA Section 208 or withholding \nunder Section 241(b)(3) or withholding under the \nConvention against Torture for having been convicted of a \nparticularly serious crime, that pertaining to distribution \nof marijuana and then having been sentenced to 25 \nyears, reduced to 15. That leaves him eligible to apply for \nprotection from removal under the Convention against \nTorture or deferral of removal under the Convention \nagainst Torture. \nTo be extended protection under the Convention \nagainst Torture the applicant must establish that it is more \nlikely than not that he would be tortured if removed to his \nhome country. See 8 C.F.R. Section 208.16(c), and see also \nMatter of M-B-A-, 23 I&N Dec. 474, 477-78 (BIA 2002). \nTorture is defined in part as the intentional infliction of \nsevere physical or mental pain or suffering by or at the \ninstigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a \npublic official or other person acting in an official capacity \nin the country of removal. 8 C.F.R. Section 1208.18(a)(1). \nTo meet his burden for CAT protection the applicant must \nmeet two distinct showings. First, he must demonstrate \nlikely future mistreatment in his home country that \nconstitutes severe pain or suffering that is intentionally \ninflicted. See Cruz-Quintanilla v. Whittaker, 914 F.3d 884, \n886 (4th Cir. 2019). And second, the applicant must show \nthe mistreatment will occur at the hands of government \nor with their consent or acquiescence. See id.\n\nAppendix C\n23a\nIn this case, the applicant testified that he fears \n and his associates. Applicant never \nmentioned that he fears the police directly. His only \ncomment about the police is that they will not do anything \nand that they did not do anything when his mother and \nhis cousin, two of whom are dead, but one of them went \nto the police and ended up dying. In neither of those \nincidents the police ever did anything. So the applicant \nmust demonstrate that it is more likely than not that the \npolice, the authorities in Jamaica would acquiesce to his \ntorture at the hands of \n or \n \nassociates. To prove this, applicant must do more than \nshow that the government is powerless to stop the \ntorture. He has to show that the public official would have \nawareness of or will remain willfully blind to the activity \nconstituting torture prior to its commission, and therefore \nbreach their responsibility to intervene to prevent such \nactivity. 8 C.F.R. Section 1208.18(a)(7); see also Suarez-\nValenzuela v. Holder, 714 F.3d 241, 245-46 (4th Cir. 2013). \nRelevant factors to assessing willful blindness include \nbut is not limited to, evidence of past torture, evidence \nof gross, flagrant or mass violations of human rights, \ngeneral country conditions, and whether the applicant \ncould relocate to another part of the country where he or \nshe is unlikely to be tortured. See Suarez-Valenzuela v. \nHolder, 714 F.3d at 245.\nApplicant here has credibly testified, as previously \nmentioned, the existence of this individual named Andrew \n his Jamaican nationality, his involvement with \ndrugs, and credibility he testified as to his control over \nthe neighborhood in which applicant lived in which his \n\nAppendix C\n24a\nmother and sister continue to live. Applicant also credibly \ntestified as to \n biography. He is an \nex-cop. He is tied politically to the JLP Party which \ndominates his neighborhood in Jamaica. Applicant also \ncredibly testified as to the harm that \n caused \nhis two cousins, having killed one and then having killed \nthe other for trying to get police to investigate the killing \nof the first cousin. Applicant also credibly testified that \nthe police, when informed of threats of \n against \nhim, did not do anything, refused to do anything. And the \nCourt found all of the above credible, not just based on the \ndetailed testimony, but based on the background evidence \nin this case. The one that is very reliable is the U.S. \nDepartment of State Human Rights Report of Jamaica, \nthe most recent one coming from 2020. Right off the bat \non page one it states significant human rights include \nnumerous reports of unlawful and arbitrary killings by \ngovernment security forces, harsh and life-threatening \nconditions in prisons and detention facilities, arbitrary \narrests and detentions, serious corruption by officials, \nlack of accountability for violence against vulnerable \npopulations. It also states the government took steps to \ninvestigate, prosecute officials, but there were credible \nreports that some officials alleged to have committed \nhuman rights abuses were not subject to full and swift \naccountability. The report goes on to discuss the number \nof people who have been killed, or examples of people who \nhave been killed by the government security forces. The \nincrease in the number of fatalities involving security \nforces in 2020 compared to 2019. Specific to torture, the \nDepartment of State states that there is no definition of \ntorture in Jamaica. That there were allegations of torture \n\nAppendix C\n25a\nespecially for people in police custody. Some examples of \nthese torture that resulting in death, injury, rape. States \nthat the government did not take sufficient action to \naddress abuse and unlawful killings by security forces. \nSays the government has mechanisms to investigate and \npunish the abuse, but they were not always employed. \nIn fact, it states fewer than ten percent of investigations \nof abuse resulted in recommendations for disciplinary \naction or criminal charges, and fewer than two percent \nled to a conviction. All of this is not inconsistent with the \napplicant\u2019s description of how police reacted to his cousin\u2019s \nattempt to find or to have police investigate the murder \nof the applicant\u2019s first cousin, O\u2019Neal, or the applicant\u2019s \ntestimony as to how his mother tried to get the police \ntake the report but they refused to do so. Based on the \napplicant\u2019s credible testimony which is consistent with the \nbackground information in this case, and the Court is not \neven going to go into, although it can, the various other \nbackground articles that were submitted in support of the \napplicant\u2019s case, which details gang violence, prevalence \nor the influence of gangs, the growing influence of gangs \nin Jamaica. There is also a detailed article on the growing \ninfluence of gangs and gang violence in Jamaica from \nAmnesty International. That is all under Exhibit 6, tabs F \nand G. And for these reason the Court finds the applicant \nhas done enough to demonstrate he faces a particularized \nrisk of torture. That being that he is a male member of his \nfamily who have all been threatened by \n who has \nkilled two male members of his family with the police not \ninvestigating the death of the cousins. Applicant has also \ncredibility testified as to the influence that this individual, \n has in the neighborhood and on police. That is \n\nAppendix C\n26a\nimportant for a variety of reasons, one of which is also \nthat applicant would be forced to register his return to \nJamaica and keep police informed of his movements which \nas counsel pointed out would allow \n to know the \napplicant\u2019s whereabouts. So based on the history of this \ncase and \n treatment of applicant\u2019s family the \nCourt find that the threats are real and it is more likely \nthan not that \n would harm the applicant if he \nreturns to Jamaica. Again, a small country with the \npolice knowing where the applicant is, and does not find \nit reasonable for the applicant to relocate and be safe. \nAnd therefore would find that the applicant is more likely \nthan not to be tortured through the acquiescence of and \ntherefore will grant applicant protection from removal \nunder the Convention against Torture.\nCONCLUSION AND ORDERS\nFor the reasons stated, the court enters the following \norders.\nIT IS ORDERED that the applicant be ordered \nremoved from the United States to Jamaica.\nFURTHER ORDERED that the applicant\u2019s \napplication for withholding of removal under Section \n241(b)(3) be denied.\nFURTHER ORDERED that the applicant\u2019s application \nfor withholding of removal under the Convention against \nTorture be denied.\n\nAppendix C\n27a\nFURTHER ORDERED that applicant\u2019s application \nfor deferral of removal under the Convention against \nTorture be granted.\nJuly 27, 2021\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\nCHOI, RAPHAEL\nImmigration Judge\n\nAppendix C\n28a\nUNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE\nEXECUTIVE OFFICE FOR IMMIGRATION \nREVIEW\nARLINGTON IMMIGRATION COURT\nRespondent Name:\nRILEY, PIERRE YASSUE NASHUN\nTo:\nGeorgiev-Remmel, Dimitar Plamenov\n1220 N.

          "task_beliefs": "My initial knowledge of this case was zero. I have now established a foundational understanding of the legal issues at stake. The case presents two distinct questions for the Supreme Court to resolve. The first is a procedural question concerning the statutory interpretation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(1). Specifically, the Court must determine if the 30-day deadline for filing a petition for review is \"jurisdictional\" (a strict, un-waivable requirement that determines a court's power to hear a case) or a \"mandatory claims-processing rule\" (a rule that is obligatory but can be waived or forfeited if not raised by the opposing party). The second question is more substantive and also procedural, concerning the scope of judicial review in immigration law: whether a decision by the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) in a \"withholding-only\" proceeding constitutes a final, reviewable order. My uncertainty about the specific arguments, relevant precedents, and the Court's likely disposition remains extremely high, but I have now clearly defined the legal battleground.",
          "design_beliefs": "My initial belief state was a blank slate regarding effective strategies for SCOTUS prediction. I have now developed a foundational heuristic for approaching any new case. The most effective initial step is to analyze the primary source document that frames the appeal: the Petition for a Writ of Certiorari. This document is strategically valuable because it provides a structured overview of the petitioner's core legal arguments, articulates the specific error they believe the lower court made, and, critically, highlights any \"circuit splits\"\u2014disagreements among the federal appellate courts on the same point of law. The existence of a circuit split is a powerful signal, as resolving such splits is a primary function of the Supreme Court, making it a key factor to identify early in the analysis. This initial strategy of starting with the cert petition provides a clear roadmap for subsequent research: first, understand the petitioner's framing of the issues, and then use that framework to search for the respondent's counterarguments, amicus briefs, and the specific precedents cited by each side. Decomposing the case into its distinct legal questions (e.g., procedural vs. substantive) is also a useful method for managing complexity and structuring the analysis."

This moves the analysis from a one-sided petitioner's perspective to a complete, adversarial view, which is essential for an accurate prediction and will cause a massive update to my belief state (\u03b8).\n\nDesign EIG is also high (0.7) because observing how the government (a uniquely sophisticated litigant) handles these specific situations is highly generalizable. It will provide a masterclass on how to: 1) argue against a strong, recent SCOTUS jurisprudential trend, 2) defend a minority position in a deep circuit split, and 3) strategically manage (or abandon) a concession made in a lower court. This will significantly refine my strategic heuristics (D) for future cases.\n\nThe joint EIG is therefore very high, as this single planned action is maximally efficient at reducing uncertainty for both the specific task and the general design methodology.",

          "task_beliefs": "My foundational understanding of the case's two legal questions is now substantially enriched with specific statutory and precedential context. The observation of the Petition for a Writ of Certiorari confirms the core issues and provides the petitioner's strategic framing.\n\nFor the first question\u2014whether 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(1)\u2019s 30-day filing deadline is jurisdictional or a waivable claims-processing rule\u2014I now understand the petitioner's argument is anchored in a strong, recent line of Supreme Court precedent (*Santos-Zacaria v. Garland*, *Wilkins v. United States*, *Harrow v. Dep\u2019t of Def.*) that disfavors treating deadlines as jurisdictional unless Congress provides a \"clear statement.\" The petitioner argues the Fourth Circuit is incorrectly relying on an older case, *Stone v. INS* (1995), which was decided under a different statutory framework. Critically, the petition reveals that the government itself argued in the lower court that the deadline was *not* jurisdictional and should be waived. The Fourth Circuit's refusal to do so, despite the parties' agreement, isolates this as a pure question of law, significantly increasing the likelihood of reversal by the Supreme Court.\n\nFor the second question\u2014whether a BIA decision in a \"withholding-only\" proceeding is a \"final order of removal\" that starts the 30-day clock\u2014I now see this is a deep and acknowledged circuit split. The petitioner claims the Fourth and Second Circuits are outliers, standing against at least five other circuits. The petitioner's argument rests on the idea that an order of removal cannot be considered \"final\" for judicial review purposes until all administrative remedies, including the BIA's ruling on CAT relief, are exhausted. This argument appears to be supported by the statutory definition of a final order in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(47)(B). Key cases framing this debate are *Martinez v. Garland* and *Bhaktibhai-Patel v. Garland* (for the Fourth/Second Circuit view) versus a host of cases from other circuits cited by the petitioner.\n\nMy confidence in predicting the outcome has shifted. While still uncertain, I now have a strong belief that the petitioner will prevail on the first question. The combination of recent, favorable SCOTUS jurisprudence and the government's own concession on the issue makes the Fourth Circuit's position appear tenuous. The existence of a deep circuit split on the second question was likely a primary driver for the Court granting certiorari, and the petitioner's textual argument appears robust.",
          "design_beliefs": "My initial methodology is strongly validated and has become more sophisticated. The heuristic of starting with the Petition for a Writ of Certiorari is confirmed as the most effective initial action. This single document provided the petitioner's complete legal theory, a roadmap of controlling precedents, a characterization of the circuit splits, and the specific statutory language at issue.\n\nI have developed several new, more advanced heuristics from this observation:\n1.  **Identify Government Concessions:** A new, high-value signal to search for is whether the government (as respondent) conceded a key legal point in the lower courts. When a court rules against the government's own stated position on a matter like jurisdiction, it creates an exceptionally \"clean\" legal question for the Supreme Court, removing adversarial clutter. This is a powerful indicator that the Court will be interested in reviewing and likely reversing that specific holding.\n2.  **Track Broader SCOTUS Trends:** Effective prediction requires more than just analyzing the case's specific facts and statutes. It is crucial to identify and leverage broader jurisprudential trends. The petitioner's strategy of framing the jurisdictional question as part of the Court's recent, consistent narrowing of what constitutes a \"jurisdictional\" rule is a prime example. Future analysis must involve situating the case within these larger movements in the Court's doctrine.\n3.  **Analyze the \"Vehicle\" Argument:** I must now explicitly analyze *why* a specific case is a good \"vehicle\" for the Court to address a legal question. The petition's argument that this case is an \"ideal vehicle\" highlights this. Factors making a case a good vehicle include clean legal questions, the absence of distracting factual disputes, and, as seen here, the alignment of the parties on the reviewability of the issue.\n4.  **Quantify and Qualify Circuit Splits:** It is not enough to note the existence of a circuit split. The *depth* (e.g., 5 circuits vs. 2) and *nature* (e.g., \"acknowledged\" by the courts themselves) of the split are critical data points that signal the urgency and importance of the issue to the Supreme Court. My research strategy should now aim to map out the circuits on each side of a contested issue."

GARLAND, ATTORNEY GENERAL \n \nON PETITION FOR A WRIT OF CERTIORARI \nTO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS \nFOR THE FOURTH CIRCUIT \n \nBRIEF FOR THE RESPONDENT \n \nOPINIONS BELOW \nThe opinion of the court of appeals (Pet. App. 1a-6a) \nis not published in the Federal Reporter but is available \nat 2024 WL 1826979.  The decisions of the Board of Im-\nmigration Appeals (Pet. App. 7a-14a) and the immigra-\ntion judge (Pet. App. 15a-27a) are unreported. \nJURISDICTION \nThe judgment of the court of appeals was entered on \nApril 26, 2024.  The petition for a writ of certiorari was \nfiled on May 31, 2024.  The jurisdiction of this Court is \ninvoked under 28 U.S.C. 1254(1). \nSTATEMENT \n1. a. Under the Immigration and Nationality Act \n(INA), 8 U.S.C. 1101 et seq., a noncitizen may be subject \nto abbreviated removal proceedings under 8 U.S.C. \n1228 when the noncitizen has been convicted of an ag-\n\n2 \n \ngravated-felony offense.  8 U.S.C. 1228(b).1  When a \nnoncitizen is ordered removed under that process, he is \nineligible for any form of \u201crelief from removal that the \nAttorney General may grant in the Attorney General\u2019s \ndiscretion.\u201d  8 U.S.C. 1228(b)(5).  But a noncitizen who \nis statutorily barred from obtaining categorical relief \nfrom removal may still pursue \u201cwithholding-only relief \nto prevent [the Department of Homeland Security \n(DHS)] from executing his removal to the particular \ncountry designated in his reinstated removal order.\u201d  \nJohnson v. Guzman Chavez, 594 U.S. 523, 530 (2021); \nsee ibid. (recognizing that noncitizens who are barred \nfrom obtaining relief from removal under Section \n1231(a)(5) are still eligible for withholding of removal).  \nA withholding-only proceeding cannot result in a \ncomplete bar on a noncitizen\u2019s removal; instead, it may \nprevent him from being removed to a specific country in \nwhich he is likely to be persecuted or tortured.  See \nGuzman Chavez, 594 U.S. at 531-532.  Statutory with-\nholding of removal is available under 8 U.S.C. \n1231(b)(3)(A), which prohibits removal to a country \nwhere the noncitizen\u2019s \u201clife or freedom would be threat-\nened\u201d because of \u201crace, religion, nationality, member-\nship in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d  \nWithholding or deferral of removal is also available un-\nder regulations implementing the United States\u2019 obliga-\ntions under Article 3 of the Convention Against Torture \nand Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or \nPunishment (Convention or CAT), adopted Dec. 10, \n1984, S. Treaty Doc. No. 20, 100th Cong., 2d Sess. \n(1988), 1465 U.N.T.S. 114.  The Convention \u201cprohibits \n \n1 This brief uses the term \u201cnoncitizen\u201d as equivalent to the statu-\ntory term \u201calien.\u201d  See Barton v. Barr, 590 U.S. 222, 226 n.2 (2020) \n(quoting 8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(3)). \n\n3 \n \nremoval of a noncitizen to a country where the nonciti-\nzen likely would be tortured.\u201d  Nasrallah v. Barr, 590 \nU.S. 573, 580 (2020).   \nb. When a noncitizen is subject to abbreviated re-\nmoval procedures under Section 1228(b), he generally \ndoes not appear before an immigration judge (IJ) or \nhave a right to an administrative appeal before the Board \nof Immigration Appeals (Board).  See 8 C.F.R. 238.1.  \nInstead, regulations provide that an immigration officer \nshall conduct written removal proceedings.  8 C.F.R. \n238.1(a)-(c).  If the officer finds that the noncitizen is \neligible for removal under Section 1228(b), he issues a \n\u201cFinal Administrative Removal Order.\u201d  8 C.F.R. \n238.1(d).   \nThe regulations, however, provide an exception for \nnoncitizens who seek withholding of removal.  8 C.F.R. \n238.1(f\u200a).  When a noncitizen \u201chas requested withholding \nof removal,\u201d he will receive a reasonable-fear interview \nwith an asylum officer.  8 C.F.R. 238.1(f\u200a)(3); see 8 C.F.R. \n208.31(b).  If the asylum officer finds that the noncitizen \nhas no reasonable fear and an IJ sustains that finding, \nthe noncitizen will be deemed ineligible for withholding.  \n8 C.F.R. 208.31(f\u200a) and (g)(1).  But if the asylum officer \nor the IJ finds that the noncitizen has a reasonable fear, \nthen the noncitizen is entitled to full withholding-only \nproceedings before an IJ and an appeal to the Board.   \n8 C.F.R. 208.31(e) and (g)(2).   \nAn order denying withholding of removal \u201cmay not \nbe reviewed in [the] district courts, even via habeas cor-\npus,\u201d and must instead \u201cbe reviewed only in the courts \nof appeals\u201d under 8 U.S.C. 1252.  Nasrallah, 590 U.S. at \n580-581.  And under 8 U.S.C. 1252(b)(1), \u201c[t]he petition \nfor review must be filed not later than 30 days after the \ndate of the final order of removal.\u201d   \n\n4 \n \n2. Petitioner is a native and citizen of Jamaica.  Pet. \nApp. 16a.  He entered the United States in 1995 as a \ntourist and overstayed his visa.  Ibid.  In 2006, he was \nconvicted in federal court of multiple firearm and drug-\ntrafficking offenses and sentenced to a 25-year term of \nimprisonment.  Id. at 2a.  In January 2021, he was \ngranted compassionate release.  Ibid.  He was then \ntaken into custody by DHS and found removable under \nSection 1228(b)\u2019s abbreviated proceedings for nonciti-\nzens who have been convicted of an aggravated felony.  \nIbid.  On January 26, 2021, an immigration officer is-\nsued a Final Administrative Removal Order.  Ibid.  Af-\nter petitioner expressed a fear of returning to Jamaica, \nhe was interviewed by an immigration officer who de-\ntermined that he had not established a reasonable fear \nof persecution or torture in Jamaica.  Id. at 2a-3a.  But \nan IJ disagreed and placed petitioner in withholding-\nonly proceedings.  Ibid. \nDuring the withholding-only proceedings, petitioner \nconceded that, in light of his prior convictions, he was \neligible solely for deferral of removal under the CAT.  \nPet. App. 3a.  After an evidentiary hearing, the IJ \ngranted petitioner\u2019s application for CAT deferral, id. at \n15a-27a, but DHS appealed that decision to the Board, \nid. at 3a.  On May 31, 2022, the Board issued a decision \nvacating the IJ\u2019s order granting CAT protection, and \nthe Board ordered petitioner removed to Jamaica.  Id. \nat 7a-14a.  Four days later, on June 3, 2022, petitioner \nfiled a petition for review in the court of appeals.  Id. at \n3a.   \n3. On April 26, 2024, the court of appeals issued an \nunpublished decision dismissing the petition for review \nfor lack of jurisdiction.  Pet. App. 2a-6a.  The court \nfound that its decision was controlled by Martinez v. \n\n5 \n \nGarland, 86 F.4th 561, 566 (4th Cir. 2023), petition for \ncert. pending, No. 23-7678 (filed May 29, 2024).  Pet. \nApp. 4a-6a.   \nIn Martinez, the Fourth Circuit held that it lacked \njurisdiction to consider a petition for review of an order \ndenying withholding and CAT protection because the \npetition was filed more than 30 days after the nonciti-\nzen\u2019s prior order of removal was reinstated under Sec-\ntion 1231(a)(5).  86 F.4th at 571.  In reaching that hold-\ning, the court first found that Section 1252(b)(1)\u2019s 30-\nday filing deadline is jurisdictional.  Id. at 566-567 & n.3.  \nIt then determined that Section 1252(b)(1)\u2019s deadline \ncannot be triggered by a withholding order because it is \nnot a \u201cfinal order of removal.\u201d  Id. at 567.   \nMartinez assumed that a reinstatement order under \nSection 1231(a)(5) can qualify as a \u201cfinal order of re-\nmoval\u201d but\u2014relying on the Second Circuit\u2019s decision in \nBhaktibhai-Patel v. Garland, 32 F.4th 180 (2022)\u2014\nMartinez held that a reinstatement determination be-\ncomes final as soon as the immigration officer makes his \ndecision, regardless of the pendency of any withholding-\nonly proceedings.  86 F.4th at 568-572.  Accordingly, \nMartinez found that a petition for review of a post- \nreinstatement order denying withholding or CAT pro-\ntection is untimely if it is filed more than 30 days after \nthe immigration officer\u2019s reinstatement determination \nbecomes final, even if the withholding-only proceedings \nare still ongoing at that time.  Id. at 571.    \nIn the decision below, the court of appeals found \nthat, under Martinez, Section 1252(b)(1)\u2019s 30-day filing \ndeadline is jurisdictional.  Pet. App. 4a.  And the court \nfurther found that, under Martinez, the 30-day deadline \nbegan to run as soon as the immigration officer ordered \npetitioner removed under Section 1228(b), even though \n\n6 \n \nthe withholding-only proceedings were still pending.  \nIbid.  The court explained that it could \u201cdiscern no rea-\nson\u201d to \u201cdifferentiat[e] between\u201d reinstatement deter-\nminations under Section 1231(a)(5) and administrative \nremoval orders under Section 1228(b).  Id. at 5a.   \nDISCUSSION \nPetitioner contends (Pet. 15-19) that the court of ap-\npeals erred in holding that the deadline in 8 U.S.C. \n1252(b)(1) for filing a petition for review of an order of \nremoval is jurisdictional.  Petitioner is correct, and \nthere is division in the circuits regarding whether Sec-\ntion 1252(b)(1)\u2019s filing deadline is jurisdictional.  But \nplenary review of that question would be premature be-\ncause this Court recently held that an analogous statu-\ntory filing deadline is not jurisdictional, and it empha-\nsized that \u201cmost time bars are nonjurisdictional,\u201d even \nwhen \u201cframed in mandatory terms.\u201d  Harrow v. Depart-\nment of Def., 601 U.S. 480, 484 (2024) (citations omit-\nted).  Because Harrow was decided after the court of \nappeals\u2019 proceedings in this case had concluded, this \nCourt should grant certiorari, vacate the court of ap-\npeals\u2019 decision, and remand for further proceedings in \nlight of Harrow\u2019s guidance regarding when a time limit \nmay be deemed jurisdictional.2   \nPetitioner also contends (Pet. 19-26) that the court of \nappeals erred in holding that a petition for review must \nbe filed within 30 days of the underlying administrative \nremoval determination, rather than within 30 days of \n \n2  Two other pending petitions for writs of certiorari seek review \nof the same or related questions, and the government is urging the \nsame disposition for those petitions in responses being filed at the \nsame time as this one.  See Martinez v. Garland, No. 23-7678 (filed \nMay 29, 2024); Miranda Sanchez v. Garland, No. 24-11 (filed July \n3, 2024).   \n\n7 \n \nthe issuance of the order denying CAT protection.  Pe-\ntitioner is correct, but again, review by this Court would \nbe premature.  The court of appeals reached its errone-\nous holding in reliance on its precedent regarding the \ntimeliness of petitions for review of orders denying \nwithholding of removal or CAT protection after previ-\nous orders of removal have been reinstated under  \n8 U.S.C. 1231(a)(5).  That precedent was in turn based \non the Second Circuit\u2019s decision in Bhaktibhai-Patel v. \nGarland, 32 F.4th 180 (2022).  But the Second Circuit \nordered supplemental briefing on the continued vitality \nof Bhaktibhai-Patel in a pair of cases that are still pend-\ning, suggesting that the issue is not yet ripe for the \nCourt\u2019s review.  Moreover, if the case is remanded in \nlight of Harrow and the court of appeals appropriately \ndetermines that the deadline in Section 1252(b)(1) is \nnonjurisdictional, the government intends to waive the \napplication of the 30-day deadline, which could prevent \npetitioner from being affected by the court of appeals\u2019 \nerroneous understanding of when a petition for review \nmust be filed.   \n1. The court of appeals erred in holding that Section \n1252(b)(1) is jurisdictional.  That holding cannot be rec-\nonciled with Santos-Zacaria v. Garland, 598 U.S. 411 \n(2023), and Harrow, supra.  But because the court of \nappeals addressed the issue without the benefit of Har-\nrow, this Court should grant, vacate, and remand for \nfurther consideration in light of that decision.  \na.  Section 1252(b)(1) provides that a \u201cpetition for re-\nview must be filed not later than 30 days after the date \nof the final order of removal.\u201d  That text does not clearly \nindicate that the provision is intended to govern the \ncourt of appeals\u2019 subject-matter jurisdiction, but until \nrecently, the courts of appeals and the government \n\n8 \n \ncharacterized the time limit as jurisdictional based on \nthis Court\u2019s 1995 decision in Stone v. INS, 514 U.S. 386.3  \nIn Stone, the Court described a prior version of the \nINA\u2019s filing deadline, 8 U.S.C. 1105a(a)(6) (Supp. V \n1993), as \u201cjurisdictional.\u201d  514 U.S. at 405 (citation omit-\nted).  The Court reasoned that \u201c[\u200aj]udicial review provi-\nsions  * * *  are jurisdictional in nature,\u201d and this was \n\u201call the more true of statutory provisions specifying the \ntiming of review, for those time limits are, as we have \noften stated, \u2018mandatory and jurisdictional.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Ibid. (ci-\ntation omitted).   \nYet this Court\u2019s more recent decisions have made \nclear that Stone cannot be used to establish that Section \n1252(b)(1) is jurisdictional.  In Santos-Zacaria, supra, \nthe Court rejected the government\u2019s reliance on Stone \nto support its argument that the INA\u2019s exhaustion re-\nquirement, 8 U.S.C. 1252(d)(1), is jurisdictional.  598 \nU.S. at 421.  The Court explained that, while Stone \u201cde-\nscribed portions of the [INA] that contained [Section] \n1252(d)(1)\u2019s predecessor as \u2018jurisdictional,\u2019\u200a\u201d the Stone \nCourt had not \u201cattend[ed] to the distinction between \u2018ju-\nrisdictional\u2019 rules (as we understand them today) and \nnonjurisdictional but mandatory ones.\u201d  Ibid.  More-\nover, \u201cwhether the provisions were jurisdictional \u2018was \nnot central to the case.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Ibid. (citation omitted).  In \nrecognizing that Stone did not use the term \u201cjurisdic-\ntional\u201d to refer to subject-matter jurisdiction and did \nnot focus on the question of subject-matter jurisdiction \nat all, Santos-Zacaria severely undermined continued \n \n3 See, e.g., Mendias-Mendoza v. Sessions, 877 F.3d 223, 227 (5th \nCir. 2017); Chavarria-Reyes v. Lynch, 845 F.3d 275, 277 (7th Cir. \n2016); Hurtado v. Lynch, 810 F.3d 91, 93 (1st Cir. 2016); Skurtu v. \nMukasey, 552 F.3d 651, 658 (8th Cir. 2008). \n\n9 \n \nreliance on Stone to establish the jurisdictional status \nof the deadline in Section 1252(b)(1).   \nThe Court\u2019s more recent decision in Harrow makes \nit even more clear that Section 1252(b)(1) cannot be \ndeemed jurisdictional.  In Harrow, the Court held that \nthe \u201c60-day statutory deadline\u201d in 5 U.S.C. 7703(b)(1) \nfor filing a petition for review of a veterans\u2019 benefits de-\ntermination in the Federal Circuit is not a \u201cjurisdic-\ntional requirement.\u201d  601 U.S. at 483 (citation omitted).  \nIn reaching that holding, the Court repeatedly empha-\nsized that \u201cmost time bars are nonjurisdictional.\u201d  Id. at \n484 (citation omitted); see id. at 489 n.* (\u201ctime limits[,]  \n* * *  we repeat, are generally non-jurisdictional\u201d).   \nThe Court in Harrow further explained that, even \nwhen \u201cframed in mandatory terms,\u201d time bars should \nnot be deemed jurisdictional unless the \u201ctraditional \ntools of statutory construction  * * *  plainly show that \nCongress imbued [the rule] with jurisdictional conse-\nquences.\u201d  601 U.S. at 484-485 (citations omitted; brack-\nets in original).  And the Court recognized that statu-\ntory time limits are generally not jurisdictional when \nthey appear alongside other procedural requirements \nthat are plainly nonjurisdictional.  Id. at 488 (finding \nthat the statutory deadline could not be deemed juris-\ndictional in part because it appeared as part of \u201ca bevy \nof procedural rules,\u201d concerning things like the manner \nof \u201cservice and other forms\u201d).   \nb. In light of those precedents, the court of appeals \nerred in holding that Section 1252(b)(1)\u2019s 30-day filing \ndeadline is jurisdictional.  Pet. App. 4a-5a.  Santos- \nZacaria and Harrow demonstrate that Stone was not \nusing the term \u201cjurisdictional\u201d to refer to subject- \nmatter jurisdiction when it stated that \u201cstatutory provi-\nsions specifying the timing of review\u201d are \u201c\u200a\u2018mandatory \n\n10 \n \nand jurisdictional.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Stone, 514 U.S. at 405 (citation \nomitted).  Further, while Section 1252(b)(1)\u2019s text re-\nflects that the INA\u2019s deadline is mandatory, the provi-\nsion does not reference jurisdiction or otherwise \u201cset[] \nthe bounds of the \u2018court\u2019s adjudicatory authority.\u2019\u200a\u201d  \nSantos-Zacaria, 598 U.S. at 416 (citation omitted).  And \nSection 1252(b)(1) appears as part of a list of procedural \nrules for petitions for review\u2014governing things like the \nmanner of \u201c[s]ervice\u201d and whether the record must be \n\u201ctypewritten,\u201d 8 U.S.C. 1252(b)(2) and (3)\u2014that Con-\ngress is unlikely to have intended to imbue with juris-\ndictional significance.   \nAccordingly, after Santos-Zacaria, both the govern-\nment and several courts of appeals reconsidered their \nearlier position that Section 1252(b)(1) is jurisdictional \nand recognized that the provision is more appropriately \ncharacterized as a mandatory claims-processing rule.  \nSee Alonso-Juarez v. Garland, 80 F.4th 1039, 1047 (9th \nCir. 2023); Argueta-Hernandez v. Garland, 87 F.4th \n698, 705 (5th Cir. 2023); Inestroza-Tosta v. Garland, 105 \nF.4th 499, 509-512 (3d Cir. 2024).  The Fourth Circuit \nand the Seventh Circuit have declined to revisit their \nprecedent in light of Santos-Zacaria.  See Martinez v. \nGarland, 86 F.4th 561, 566-567 (4th Cir. 2023), petition \nfor cert. pending, No. 23-7678 (filed May 29, 2024); \nF.J.A.P. v. Garland, 94 F.4th 620, 634 (7th Cir. 2024).  \nBut those decisions preceded Harrow\u2019s clear emphasis \nof the principle that time bars are generally nonjuris-\ndictional.   \nc. The court of appeals did not have the benefit of \nthis Court\u2019s decision in Harrow when it decided Mar-\ntinez or when it applied the holding in Martinez to this \ncase.  This Court should therefore grant the petition for \n\n11 \n \na writ of certiorari, vacate the decision below, and re-\nmand for further proceedings in light of Harrow.   \n2. The court of appeals also erred in holding that the \npetition for review in this case was untimely under Sec-\ntion 1252(b)(1), even though it was filed within 30 days \nof the Board\u2019s order denying CAT protection.  Pet. App. \n4a-5a.  But again this Court\u2019s intervention would be \npremature because the Second Circuit appears to be re-\nconsidering the precedent on which the Fourth Circuit \nrelied, and the importance of the question will be dimin-\nished if the court of appeals holds on remand that Sec-\ntion 1252(b)(1) is not jurisdictional.  \na. Until 2022, the courts of appeals agreed that a re-\nmoval determination is not final for purposes of seeking \njudicial review until any withholding-only proceedings \nassociated with the reinstatement are completed.4  That \nunderstanding accords with the traditional rule that an \nadministrative decision is not final for purposes of judi-\ncial review until the \u201cconsummation of the agency\u2019s de-\ncisionmaking process\u201d\u2014that is, not until all of the ad-\nministrative proceedings arising from the agency action \n(including withholding-only proceedings) have been \ncompleted.  Luna-Garcia v. Holder, 777 F.3d 1182, 1185 \n(10th Cir. 2015) (quoting Bennett v. Spear, 520 U.S. 154, \n178 (1997)).   \nPursuant to that understanding, the administrative \nremoval determination and the related withholding or \n \n4 See, e.g., Ponce-Osorio v. Johnson, 824 F.3d 502 (5th Cir. 2016) \n(per curiam); Luna-Garcia v. Holder, 777 F.3d 1182 (10th Cir. \n2015); Ortiz-Alfaro v. Holder, 694 F.3d 955 (9th Cir. 2012).  Al-\nthough each of those decisions involved a reinstatement determina-\ntion under Section 1231(a)(5) rather than an administrative removal \norder under Section 1228(b), the court of appeals found that distinc-\ntion immaterial when it found that its Section 1231(a)(5) precedent \ncontrolled the outcome of this case.  Pet. App. 5a.   \n\n12 \n \nCAT order become final at the same time, thereby en-\nsuring that they may be re\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

GARLAND, ATTORNEY GENERAL \n \nON PETITION FOR A WRIT OF CERTIORARI \nTO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS \nFOR THE FOURTH CIRCUIT \n \nBRIEF FOR THE RESPONDENT \n \nOPINIONS BELOW \nThe opinion of the court of appeals (Pet. App. 1a-6a) \nis not published in the Federal Reporter but is available \nat 2024 WL 1826979.  The decisions of the Board of Im-\nmigration Appeals (Pet. App. 7a-14a) and the immigra-\ntion judge (Pet. App. 15a-27a) are unreported. \nJURISDICTION \nThe judgment of the court of appeals was entered on \nApril 26, 2024.  The petition for a writ of certiorari was \nfiled on May 31, 2024.  The jurisdiction of this Court is \ninvoked under 28 U.S.C. 1254(1). \nSTATEMENT \n1. a. Under the Immigration and Nationality Act \n(INA), 8 U.S.C. 1101 et seq., a noncitizen may be subject \nto abbreviated removal proceedings under 8 U.S.C. \n1228 when the noncitizen has been convicted of an ag-\n\n2 \n \ngravated-felony offense.  8 U.S.C. 1228(b).1  When a \nnoncitizen is ordered removed under that process, he is \nineligible for any form of \u201crelief from removal that the \nAttorney General may grant in the Attorney General\u2019s \ndiscretion.\u201d  8 U.S.C. 1228(b)(5).  But a noncitizen who \nis statutorily barred from obtaining categorical relief \nfrom removal may still pursue \u201cwithholding-only relief \nto prevent [the Department of Homeland Security \n(DHS)] from executing his removal to the particular \ncountry designated in his reinstated removal order.\u201d  \nJohnson v. Guzman Chavez, 594 U.S. 523, 530 (2021); \nsee ibid. (recognizing that noncitizens who are barred \nfrom obtaining relief from removal under Section \n1231(a)(5) are still eligible for withholding of removal).  \nA withholding-only proceeding cannot result in a \ncomplete bar on a noncitizen\u2019s removal; instead, it may \nprevent him from being removed to a specific country in \nwhich he is likely to be persecuted or tortured.  See \nGuzman Chavez, 594 U.S. at 531-532.  Statutory with-\nholding of removal is available under 8 U.S.C. \n1231(b)(3)(A), which prohibits removal to a country \nwhere the noncitizen\u2019s \u201clife or freedom would be threat-\nened\u201d because of \u201crace, religion, nationality, member-\nship in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d  \nWithholding or deferral of removal is also available un-\nder regulations implementing the United States\u2019 obliga-\ntions under Article 3 of the Convention Against Torture \nand Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or \nPunishment (Convention or CAT), adopted Dec. 10, \n1984, S. Treaty Doc. No. 20, 100th Cong., 2d Sess. \n(1988), 1465 U.N.T.S. 114.  The Convention \u201cprohibits \n \n1 This brief uses the term \u201cnoncitizen\u201d as equivalent to the statu-\ntory term \u201calien.\u201d  See Barton v. Barr, 590 U.S. 222, 226 n.2 (2020) \n(quoting 8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(3)). \n\n3 \n \nremoval of a noncitizen to a country where the nonciti-\nzen likely would be tortured.\u201d  Nasrallah v. Barr, 590 \nU.S. 573, 580 (2020).   \nb. When a noncitizen is subject to abbreviated re-\nmoval procedures under Section 1228(b), he generally \ndoes not appear before an immigration judge (IJ) or \nhave a right to an administrative appeal before the Board \nof Immigration Appeals (Board).  See 8 C.F.R. 238.1.  \nInstead, regulations provide that an immigration officer \nshall conduct written removal proceedings.  8 C.F.R. \n238.1(a)-(c).  If the officer finds that the noncitizen is \neligible for removal under Section 1228(b), he issues a \n\u201cFinal Administrative Removal Order.\u201d  8 C.F.R. \n238.1(d).   \nThe regulations, however, provide an exception for \nnoncitizens who seek withholding of removal.  8 C.F.R. \n238.1(f\u200a).  When a noncitizen \u201chas requested withholding \nof removal,\u201d he will receive a reasonable-fear interview \nwith an asylum officer.  8 C.F.R. 238.1(f\u200a)(3); see 8 C.F.R. \n208.31(b).  If the asylum officer finds that the noncitizen \nhas no reasonable fear and an IJ sustains that finding, \nthe noncitizen will be deemed ineligible for withholding.  \n8 C.F.R. 208.31(f\u200a) and (g)(1).  But if the asylum officer \nor the IJ finds that the noncitizen has a reasonable fear, \nthen the noncitizen is entitled to full withholding-only \nproceedings before an IJ and an appeal to the Board.   \n8 C.F.R. 208.31(e) and (g)(2).   \nAn order denying withholding of removal \u201cmay not \nbe reviewed in [the] district courts, even via habeas cor-\npus,\u201d and must instead \u201cbe reviewed only in the courts \nof appeals\u201d under 8 U.S.C. 1252.  Nasrallah, 590 U.S. at \n580-581.  And under 8 U.S.C. 1252(b)(1), \u201c[t]he petition \nfor review must be filed not later than 30 days after the \ndate of the final order of removal.\u201d   \n\n4 \n \n2. Petitioner is a native and citizen of Jamaica.  Pet. \nApp. 16a.  He entered the United States in 1995 as a \ntourist and overstayed his visa.  Ibid.  In 2006, he was \nconvicted in federal court of multiple firearm and drug-\ntrafficking offenses and sentenced to a 25-year term of \nimprisonment.  Id. at 2a.  In January 2021, he was \ngranted compassionate release.  Ibid.  He was then \ntaken into custody by DHS and found removable under \nSection 1228(b)\u2019s abbreviated proceedings for nonciti-\nzens who have been convicted of an aggravated felony.  \nIbid.  On January 26, 2021, an immigration officer is-\nsued a Final Administrative Removal Order.  Ibid.  Af-\nter petitioner expressed a fear of returning to Jamaica, \nhe was interviewed by an immigration officer who de-\ntermined that he had not established a reasonable fear \nof persecution or torture in Jamaica.  Id. at 2a-3a.  But \nan IJ disagreed and placed petitioner in withholding-\nonly proceedings.  Ibid. \nDuring the withholding-only proceedings, petitioner \nconceded that, in light of his prior convictions, he was \neligible solely for deferral of removal under the CAT.  \nPet. App. 3a.  After an evidentiary hearing, the IJ \ngranted petitioner\u2019s application for CAT deferral, id. at \n15a-27a, but DHS appealed that decision to the Board, \nid. at 3a.  On May 31, 2022, the Board issued a decision \nvacating the IJ\u2019s order granting CAT protection, and \nthe Board ordered petitioner removed to Jamaica.  Id. \nat 7a-14a.  Four days later, on June 3, 2022, petitioner \nfiled a petition for review in the court of appeals.  Id. at \n3a.   \n3. On April 26, 2024, the court of appeals issued an \nunpublished decision dismissing the petition for review \nfor lack of jurisdiction.  Pet. App. 2a-6a.  The court \nfound that its decision was controlled by Martinez v. \n\n5 \n \nGarland, 86 F.4th 561, 566 (4th Cir. 2023), petition for \ncert. pending, No. 23-7678 (filed May 29, 2024).  Pet. \nApp. 4a-6a.   \nIn Martinez, the Fourth Circuit held that it lacked \njurisdiction to consider a petition for review of an order \ndenying withholding and CAT protection because the \npetition was filed more than 30 days after the nonciti-\nzen\u2019s prior order of removal was reinstated under Sec-\ntion 1231(a)(5).  86 F.4th at 571.  In reaching that hold-\ning, the court first found that Section 1252(b)(1)\u2019s 30-\nday filing deadline is jurisdictional.  Id. at 566-567 & n.3.  \nIt then determined that Section 1252(b)(1)\u2019s deadline \ncannot be triggered by a withholding order because it is \nnot a \u201cfinal order of removal.\u201d  Id. at 567.   \nMartinez assumed that a reinstatement order under \nSection 1231(a)(5) can qualify as a \u201cfinal order of re-\nmoval\u201d but\u2014relying on the Second Circuit\u2019s decision in \nBhaktibhai-Patel v. Garland, 32 F.4th 180 (2022)\u2014\nMartinez held that a reinstatement determination be-\ncomes final as soon as the immigration officer makes his \ndecision, regardless of the pendency of any withholding-\nonly proceedings.  86 F.4th at 568-572.  Accordingly, \nMartinez found that a petition for review of a post- \nreinstatement order denying withholding or CAT pro-\ntection is untimely if it is filed more than 30 days after \nthe immigration officer\u2019s reinstatement determination \nbecomes final, even if the withholding-only proceedings \nare still ongoing at that time.  Id. at 571.    \nIn the decision below, the court of appeals found \nthat, under Martinez, Section 1252(b)(1)\u2019s 30-day filing \ndeadline is jurisdictional.  Pet. App. 4a.  And the court \nfurther found that, under Martinez, the 30-day deadline \nbegan to run as soon as the immigration officer ordered \npetitioner removed under Section 1228(b), even though \n\n6 \n \nthe withholding-only proceedings were still pending.  \nIbid.  The court explained that it could \u201cdiscern no rea-\nson\u201d to \u201cdifferentiat[e] between\u201d reinstatement deter-\nminations under Section 1231(a)(5) and administrative \nremoval orders under Section 1228(b).  Id. at 5a.   \nDISCUSSION \nPetitioner contends (Pet. 15-19) that the court of ap-\npeals erred in holding that the deadline in 8 U.S.C. \n1252(b)(1) for filing a petition for review of an order of \nremoval is jurisdictional.  Petitioner is correct, and \nthere is division in the circuits regarding whether Sec-\ntion 1252(b)(1)\u2019s filing deadline is jurisdictional.  But \nplenary review of that question would be premature be-\ncause this Court recently held that an analogous statu-\ntory filing deadline is not jurisdictional, and it empha-\nsized that \u201cmost time bars are nonjurisdictional,\u201d even \nwhen \u201cframed in mandatory terms.\u201d  Harrow v. Depart-\nment of Def., 601 U.S. 480, 484 (2024) (citations omit-\nted).  Because Harrow was decided after the court of \nappeals\u2019 proceedings in this case had concluded, this \nCourt should grant certiorari, vacate the court of ap-\npeals\u2019 decision, and remand for further proceedings in \nlight of Harrow\u2019s guidance regarding when a time limit \nmay be deemed jurisdictional.2   \nPetitioner also contends (Pet. 19-26) that the court of \nappeals erred in holding that a petition for review must \nbe filed within 30 days of the underlying administrative \nremoval determination, rather than within 30 days of \n \n2  Two other pending petitions for writs of certiorari seek review \nof the same or related questions, and the government is urging the \nsame disposition for those petitions in responses being filed at the \nsame time as this one.  See Martinez v. Garland, No. 23-7678 (filed \nMay 29, 2024); Miranda Sanchez v. Garland, No. 24-11 (filed July \n3, 2024).   \n\n7 \n \nthe issuance of the order denying CAT protection.  Pe-\ntitioner is correct, but again, review by this Court would \nbe premature.  The court of appeals reached its errone-\nous holding in reliance on its precedent regarding the \ntimeliness of petitions for review of orders denying \nwithholding of removal or CAT protection after previ-\nous orders of removal have been reinstated under  \n8 U.S.C. 1231(a)(5).  That precedent was in turn based \non the Second Circuit\u2019s decision in Bhaktibhai-Patel v. \nGarland, 32 F.4th 180 (2022).  But the Second Circuit \nordered supplemental briefing on the continued vitality \nof Bhaktibhai-Patel in a pair of cases that are still pend-\ning, suggesting that the issue is not yet ripe for the \nCourt\u2019s review.  Moreover, if the case is remanded in \nlight of Harrow and the court of appeals appropriately \ndetermines that the deadline in Section 1252(b)(1) is \nnonjurisdictional, the government intends to waive the \napplication of the 30-day deadline, which could prevent \npetitioner from being affected by the court of appeals\u2019 \nerroneous understanding of when a petition for review \nmust be filed.   \n1. The court of appeals erred in holding that Section \n1252(b)(1) is jurisdictional.  That holding cannot be rec-\nonciled with Santos-Zacaria v. Garland, 598 U.S. 411 \n(2023), and Harrow, supra.  But because the court of \nappeals addressed the issue without the benefit of Har-\nrow, this Court should grant, vacate, and remand for \nfurther consideration in light of that decision.  \na.  Section 1252(b)(1) provides that a \u201cpetition for re-\nview must be filed not later than 30 days after the date \nof the final order of removal.\u201d  That text does not clearly \nindicate that the provision is intended to govern the \ncourt of appeals\u2019 subject-matter jurisdiction, but until \nrecently, the courts of appeals and the government \n\n8 \n \ncharacterized the time limit as jurisdictional based on \nthis Court\u2019s 1995 decision in Stone v. INS, 514 U.S. 386.3  \nIn Stone, the Court described a prior version of the \nINA\u2019s filing deadline, 8 U.S.C. 1105a(a)(6) (Supp. V \n1993), as \u201cjurisdictional.\u201d  514 U.S. at 405 (citation omit-\nted).  The Court reasoned that \u201c[\u200aj]udicial review provi-\nsions  * * *  are jurisdictional in nature,\u201d and this was \n\u201call the more true of statutory provisions specifying the \ntiming of review, for those time limits are, as we have \noften stated, \u2018mandatory and jurisdictional.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Ibid. (ci-\ntation omitted).   \nYet this Court\u2019s more recent decisions have made \nclear that Stone cannot be used to establish that Section \n1252(b)(1) is jurisdictional.  In Santos-Zacaria, supra, \nthe Court rejected the government\u2019s reliance on Stone \nto support its argument that the INA\u2019s exhaustion re-\nquirement, 8 U.S.C. 1252(d)(1), is jurisdictional.  598 \nU.S. at 421.  The Court explained that, while Stone \u201cde-\nscribed portions of the [INA] that contained [Section] \n1252(d)(1)\u2019s predecessor as \u2018jurisdictional,\u2019\u200a\u201d the Stone \nCourt had not \u201cattend[ed] to the distinction between \u2018ju-\nrisdictional\u2019 rules (as we understand them today) and \nnonjurisdictional but mandatory ones.\u201d  Ibid.  More-\nover, \u201cwhether the provisions were jurisdictional \u2018was \nnot central to the case.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Ibid. (citation omitted).  In \nrecognizing that Stone did not use the term \u201cjurisdic-\ntional\u201d to refer to subject-matter jurisdiction and did \nnot focus on the question of subject-matter jurisdiction \nat all, Santos-Zacaria severely undermined continued \n \n3 See, e.g., Mendias-Mendoza v. Sessions, 877 F.3d 223, 227 (5th \nCir. 2017); Chavarria-Reyes v. Lynch, 845 F.3d 275, 277 (7th Cir. \n2016); Hurtado v. Lynch, 810 F.3d 91, 93 (1st Cir. 2016); Skurtu v. \nMukasey, 552 F.3d 651, 658 (8th Cir. 2008). \n\n9 \n \nreliance on Stone to establish the jurisdictional status \nof the deadline in Section 1252(b)(1).   \nThe Court\u2019s more recent decision in Harrow makes \nit even more clear that Section 1252(b)(1) cannot be \ndeemed jurisdictional.  In Harrow, the Court held that \nthe \u201c60-day statutory deadline\u201d in 5 U.S.C. 7703(b)(1) \nfor filing a petition for review of a veterans\u2019 benefits de-\ntermination in the Federal Circuit is not a \u201cjurisdic-\ntional requirement.\u201d  601 U.S. at 483 (citation omitted).  \nIn reaching that holding, the Court repeatedly empha-\nsized that \u201cmost time bars are nonjurisdictional.\u201d  Id. at \n484 (citation omitted); see id. at 489 n.* (\u201ctime limits[,]  \n* * *  we repeat, are generally non-jurisdictional\u201d).   \nThe Court in Harrow further explained that, even \nwhen \u201cframed in mandatory terms,\u201d time bars should \nnot be deemed jurisdictional unless the \u201ctraditional \ntools of statutory construction  * * *  plainly show that \nCongress imbued [the rule] with jurisdictional conse-\nquences.\u201d  601 U.S. at 484-485 (citations omitted; brack-\nets in original).  And the Court recognized that statu-\ntory time limits are generally not jurisdictional when \nthey appear alongside other procedural requirements \nthat are plainly nonjurisdictional.  Id. at 488 (finding \nthat the statutory deadline could not be deemed juris-\ndictional in part because it appeared as part of \u201ca bevy \nof procedural rules,\u201d concerning things like the manner \nof \u201cservice and other forms\u201d).   \nb. In light of those precedents, the court of appeals \nerred in holding that Section 1252(b)(1)\u2019s 30-day filing \ndeadline is jurisdictional.  Pet. App. 4a-5a.  Santos- \nZacaria and Harrow demonstrate that Stone was not \nusing the term \u201cjurisdictional\u201d to refer to subject- \nmatter jurisdiction when it stated that \u201cstatutory provi-\nsions specifying the timing of review\u201d are \u201c\u200a\u2018mandatory \n\n10 \n \nand jurisdictional.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Stone, 514 U.S. at 405 (citation \nomitted).  Further, while Section 1252(b)(1)\u2019s text re-\nflects that the INA\u2019s deadline is mandatory, the provi-\nsion does not reference jurisdiction or otherwise \u201cset[] \nthe bounds of the \u2018court\u2019s adjudicatory authority.\u2019\u200a\u201d  \nSantos-Zacaria, 598 U.S. at 416 (citation omitted).  And \nSection 1252(b)(1) appears as part of a list of procedural \nrules for petitions for review\u2014governing things like the \nmanner of \u201c[s]ervice\u201d and whether the record must be \n\u201ctypewritten,\u201d 8 U.S.C. 1252(b)(2) and (3)\u2014that Con-\ngress is unlikely to have intended to imbue with juris-\ndictional significance.   \nAccordingly, after Santos-Zacaria, both the govern-\nment and several courts of appeals reconsidered their \nearlier position that Section 1252(b)(1) is jurisdictional \nand recognized that the provision is more appropriately \ncharacterized as a mandatory claims-processing rule.  \nSee Alonso-Juarez v. Garland, 80 F.4th 1039, 1047 (9th \nCir. 2023); Argueta-Hernandez v. Garland, 87 F.4th \n698, 705 (5th Cir. 2023); Inestroza-Tosta v. Garland, 105 \nF.4th 499, 509-512 (3d Cir. 2024).  The Fourth Circuit \nand the Seventh Circuit have declined to revisit their \nprecedent in light of Santos-Zacaria.  See Martinez v. \nGarland, 86 F.4th 561, 566-567 (4th Cir. 2023), petition \nfor cert. pending, No. 23-7678 (filed May 29, 2024); \nF.J.A.P. v. Garland, 94 F.4th 620, 634 (7th Cir. 2024).  \nBut those decisions preceded Harrow\u2019s clear emphasis \nof the principle that time bars are generally nonjuris-\ndictional.   \nc. The court of appeals did not have the benefit of \nthis Court\u2019s decision in Harrow when it decided Mar-\ntinez or when it applied the holding in Martinez to this \ncase.  This Court should therefore grant the petition for \n\n11 \n \na writ of certiorari, vacate the decision below, and re-\nmand for further proceedings in light of Harrow.   \n2. The court of appeals also erred in holding that the \npetition for review in this case was untimely under Sec-\ntion 1252(b)(1), even though it was filed within 30 days \nof the Board\u2019s order denying CAT protection.  Pet. App. \n4a-5a.  But again this Court\u2019s intervention would be \npremature because the Second Circuit appears to be re-\nconsidering the precedent on which the Fourth Circuit \nrelied, and the importance of the question will be dimin-\nished if the court of appeals holds on remand that Sec-\ntion 1252(b)(1) is not jurisdictional.  \na. Until 2022, the courts of appeals agreed that a re-\nmoval determination is not final for purposes of seeking \njudicial review until any withholding-only proceedings \nassociated with the reinstatement are completed.4  That \nunderstanding accords with the traditional rule that an \nadministrative decision is not final for purposes of judi-\ncial review until the \u201cconsummation of the agency\u2019s de-\ncisionmaking process\u201d\u2014that is, not until all of the ad-\nministrative proceedings arising from the agency action \n(including withholding-only proceedings) have been \ncompleted.  Luna-Garcia v. Holder, 777 F.3d 1182, 1185 \n(10th Cir. 2015) (quoting Bennett v. Spear, 520 U.S. 154, \n178 (1997)).   \nPursuant to that understanding, the administrative \nremoval determination and the related withholding or \n \n4 See, e.g., Ponce-Osorio v. Johnson, 824 F.3d 502 (5th Cir. 2016) \n(per curiam); Luna-Garcia v. Holder, 777 F.3d 1182 (10th Cir. \n2015); Ortiz-Alfaro v. Holder, 694 F.3d 955 (9th Cir. 2012).  Al-\nthough each of those decisions involved a reinstatement determina-\ntion under Section 1231(a)(5) rather than an administrative removal \norder under Section 1228(b), the court of appeals found that distinc-\ntion immaterial when it found that its Section 1231(a)(5) precedent \ncontrolled the outcome of this case.  Pet. App. 5a.   \n\n12 \n \nCAT order become final at the same time, thereby en-\nsuring that they may be reviewed through a single peti-\ntion for review filed within 30 days of the \u201cfinal order of \nremoval.\u201d  8 U.S.C. 1252(b)(1).  Congress obviously in-\ntended that synchronicity because 8 U.S.C. 1252(b)(9) \nprovides that judicial review of \u201call questions of law and \nfact  * * *  arising from any action taken or proceeding \nbrought to remove an alien  * * *  shall be available only \nin judicial review of a final order under this section.\u201d  \nSee Nasrallah v. Barr, 590 U.S. 573, 583 (2020) (recog-\nnizing that, under 8 U.S.C. 1252(b)(9), \u201ca CAT order \nmay be reviewed together with the final order of re-\nmoval\u201d).  Because of Section 1252(b)(1)\u2019s 30-day filing \ndeadline, it would not be possible to consolidate judicial \nreview of all removal-related issues into a single pro-\nceeding, as Section 1252(b)(9) contemplates, unless the \nremoval order and any related administrative orders \nwere understood as becoming final at the same time.   \nNonetheless, in 2022 the Second Circuit broke from \nthe previous consensus that Section 1252(b)(1)\u2019s 30-day \nclock begins to run after withholding-only proceedings \nare complete.  See Bhaktibhai-Patel, supra.  In Bhak-\ntibhai-Patel, the court of appeals held that an immigra-\ntion officer\u2019s decision to reinstate a prior removal order \nunder Section 1231(a)(5) becomes \u201cfinal\u201d under Section \n1252 (and the 30-day clock starts to run) as soon as the \ndecision is made, even if withholding-only proceedings \nare still pending.  The Second Circuit believed that po-\nsition followed from this Court\u2019s decisions in Nasrallah, \nsupra, and Johnson v. Guzman Chavez, 594 U.S. 523 \n(2021).  Bhaktibhai-Patel, 32 F.4th at 193-194.  The Sec-\nond Circuit observed that, under Nasrallah, an order \nregarding withholding is distinct from a \u201cremoval or-\nder.\u201d  Id. at 191.  And it further observed that, in Guz-\n\n13 \n \nman Chavez, the Court held that a reinstated removal \norder is final for purposes of detention pending removal \nunder 8 U.S.C. 1231(a)(1)(B), even if the related with-\nholding-only proceedings are still pending.  Bhaktibhai-\nPatel, 32 F.4th at 193.   \nFrom those premises, Bhaktibhai-Patel concluded \nthat a reinstated removal order must also be final for \npurposes of judicial review under Section 1252, even if \nwithholding-only proceedings are still pending.  32 \nF.4th at 193-195.  And because an order denying with-\nholding or CAT protection \u201cis not itself a final order of \nremoval,\u201d the court found that such an order cannot \ntrigger another 30-day window for filing a petition for \nreview under Section 1252(a)(1).  Id. at 191 (citation \nomitted).  Bhaktibhai-Patel therefore concluded that \njudicial review of an order denying withholding is pos-\nsible only if a petition for review is filed within 30 days \nof the underlying decision to reinstate a previous re-\nmoval order.  Id. at 191-192.   \nb. Relying on Bhaktibhai-Patel, the Fourth Circuit \nheld in Martinez, supra, that a petition for review of a \npost-reinstatement withholding order is timely only if it \nis filed within 30 days of the reinstatement determina-\ntion.  And, relying on Martinez, the decision below held \nthat a petition for review of an order denying CAT pro-\ntection is untimely when it is filed more than 30 days \nafter the underlying administrative removal determina-\ntion under Section 1228(b).  Pet. App. 4a-5a.  That was \nerror.   \nWhile the court of appeals was correct that the same \nprinciples apply in the context of administrative re-\nmoval orders under Section 1228(b) and reinstatement \ndeterminations under Section 1231(a)(5), Pet. App. 5a, \nthose principles establish that neither an administrative \n\n14 \n \nremoval order nor a reinstatement determination be-\ncomes final until after the conclusion of any associated \nCAT or withholding proceedings.  See pp. 11-12, supra.  \nAnd as the Fifth Circuit recently recognized when it re-\nconsidered a decision that had adopted Bhaktibhai- \nPatel\u2019s reasoning, neither Nasrallah nor Guzman \nChavez upsets the well-established understanding that \na petition for review of an order denying CAT protec-\ntion is timely so long as it is filed within 30 days of the \ndate on which the CAT order was issued.  See Argueta-\nHernandez, 87 F.4th at 706.   \nNasrallah involved the applicability of a judicial- \nreview bar to findings of fact within an order denying \nCAT protection; it did not change the timing or availa-\nbility of judicial review of CAT orders.  590 U.S. at 587.  \nTo the contrary, the Court recognized that Congress \nhas \u201cprovide[d] for direct review of CAT orders in the \ncourts of appeals.\u201d  Id. at 585 (citing 8 U.S.C. 1252(a)(4) \nand (b)(9)).  And the Nasrallah Court expressly stated \nthat its \u201cdecision d[id] not affect the authority of the \ncourts of appeals to review CAT orders.\u201d  Ibid.  That \nassurance would be eviscerated if the 30-day deadline \nfor seeking judicial review starts to run before any at-\ntendant CAT proceedings have concluded.   \nFurther, while Guzman Chavez held that the pen-\ndency of withholding-only proceedings does not render \na removal order nonfinal for purposes of triggering ad-\nministrative detention under 8 U.S.C. 1231, the Court \nexplained that it was not expressing any \u201cview on \nwhether the lower courts are correct in\u201d holding that a \nremoval order is not final for purposes of Section 1252 \nuntil withholding-only proceedings are complete.  594 \nU.S. at 535 n.6.  The Court observed that Section 1252 \n\u201cuses different language than [Section] 1231 and relates \n\n15 \n \nto judicial review of removal orders rather than deten-\ntion.\u201d  Ibid. \nAs the Fifth Circuit recently observed, embracing \nthe reasoning of Bhaktibhai-Patel could also \u201chave dis-\nastrous consequences on the immigration and judicial \nsystems.\u201d  Argueta-Hernandez, 87 F.4th at 706.  If a \nnoncitizen could obtain review of a withholding or CAT \norder only by filing a petition for review within 30 days \nof the underlying removal determination, then the \nnoncitizen would have an incentive to file a prophylactic \npetition for review, in the hopes of convincing the court \nof appeals to hold his petition in abeyance until the with-\nholding or CAT proceedings have concluded so that, if \nthe agency ultimately denies the requested relief, he \nmay then challenge any asserted errors in that denial \norder.  See id. at 706 & n.5.  And given that most with-\nholding and CAT proceedings take months or years to \ncomplete, the courts of appeals would be forced to \nchoose between permitting \u201cnumerous\u201d burdensome, \nprophylactic petitions, ibid., or effectively foreclosing \njudicial review of withholding and CAT orders in the \ncontext of administrative removal orders under Section \n1228(b) and reinstatement determinations under Sec-\ntion 1231(a)(5).  But see Nasrallah, 590 U.S. at 583-584 \n(emphasizing that CAT orders are judicially reviewa-\nble).   \nc. Although the court of appeals\u2019 decision regarding \nthe timeliness of the petition for review was erroneous, \nthis Court\u2019s intervention would be premature.  Most of \nthe courts of appeals to have considered the question \nhave declined to adopt Bhaktibhai-Patel\u2019s reasoning.5  \n \n5 See Inestroza-Tosta, 105 F.4th at 514 & n.12; F.J.A.P., 94 F.4th \nat 631-638; Argueta-Hernandez, 87 F.4th at 705-706; Alonso-Juarez, \n80 F.4th at 1047-1054; Kolov v. Garland, 78 F.4th 911, 916-919 (6th \n\n16 \n \nAnd the Second Circuit itself has issued a briefing order \nindicating that it may be inclined to reconsider its deci-\nsion.

The court held oral argument \nin the cases in which the briefing order was issued in \nApril, but the cases have not yet been decided.  If the \nSecond Circuit retreats from its erroneous position, the \nFourth Circuit could well do the same, obviating the \nneed for this Court\u2019s intervention. \nMoreover, the importance of the question would be \ndiminished if the Court remands the jurisdictional ques-\ntion for reconsideration in light of Harrow, and the \ncourt of appeals appropriately deems Section 1252(b)(1)\u2019s \nfiling deadline to be nonjurisdictional.  In that event, the \ngovernment intends to waive any argument that the pe-\ntition for review was untimely\u2014both in this case and in \nother cases in which a similarly situated noncitizen has \nfiled a petition for review within 30 days of the issuance \nof a CAT or withholding order.  The government\u2019s \nwaiver would permit the same filing deadline to apply \nregardless of the circuit in which the petition for review \nwas filed.   \n \nCir. 2023); Arostegui-Maldonado v.

          "task_beliefs": "My understanding of this case is now layered, moving from the petitioner's arguments to a strategic assessment of the case's overall posture. My foundational knowledge, derived from the Petition for a Writ of Certiorari, remains stable:\n\n*   **Question 1 (Jurisdictional Deadline):** The petitioner argues that 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(1)\u2019s 30-day filing deadline is a non-jurisdictional, waivable claims-processing rule. This argument is strongly supported by a clear trend in recent Supreme Court cases (*Santos-Zacaria*, *Wilkins*, *Harrow*) that require a \"clear statement\" from Congress to treat a deadline as jurisdictional. The petitioner contends the Fourth Circuit erred by relying on the older *Stone v. INS* precedent, which was decided under a different statutory regime. The most critical fact remains the petitioner's assertion that the government conceded this point in the lower court, making the Fourth Circuit's ruling an outlier even against the parties' agreed position.\n*   **Question 2 (Final Order of Removal):** The petitioner argues that a BIA decision in a \"withholding-only\" proceeding constitutes a \"final order of removal\" that can be immediately appealed, starting the 30-day clock. This position is supported by a majority of circuits (at least five) against a minority (Fourth and Second Circuits). The petitioner's argument is rooted in the statutory definition of a final order and the principle of exhausting administrative remedies before seeking judicial review.\n\nMy latest observation, an internal reasoning step, does not introduce new external facts but refines my model of the case by explicitly identifying the primary source of my remaining uncertainty. My prediction is now contingent on the respondent's (the government's) arguments. The central question is whether the government will maintain its lower-court concession that the deadline is not jurisdictional. If they do, a reversal on Question 1 seems almost certain. If they reverse their position, the case becomes a more standard adversarial dispute, though the petitioner's reliance on recent SCOTUS precedent remains a very strong argument. My confidence in the outcome of Question 2 is also awaiting the government's counterarguments to the petitioner's characterization of the circuit split and statutory interpretation.",
          "design_beliefs": "My methodological framework has evolved from a set of initial heuristics to a more dynamic, sequential research strategy. The core principles, validated by analyzing the petition, remain highly effective:\n\n1.  **Start with the Petition:** Confirmed as the highest-yield initial action for mapping the legal landscape, identifying key precedents, and understanding the petitioner's core theory.\n2.  **Identify Government Concessions:** A confirmed high-value signal. A lower-court concession creates a uniquely clean legal question for SCOTUS, increasing the odds of review and reversal.\n3.  **Track Broader SCOTUS Trends:** Situating a case within larger jurisprudential movements (e.g., the narrowing of jurisdictional rules) is essential for accurate prediction.\n4.  **Analyze the \"Vehicle\" Argument:** Evaluating *why* a case is a good vehicle (clean legal question, no factual disputes) is a key part of assessing the likelihood of certiorari and the potential outcome.\n5.  **Quantify and Qualify Circuit Splits:** The depth and nature of a split are critical data points for predicting whether the Court will intervene.\n\nMy most recent observation (the `THINK` action) has added a crucial meta-level heuristic to my design process, which I will call **Strategic Uncertainty Reduction**:\n\n6.  **Strategic Uncertainty Reduction:** This is a formalization of the experimental design process. After digesting a significant piece of evidence (like the petitioner's brief), the next step is not to randomly seek more information, but to:\n    a.  **Pause and Model:** Consciously reflect on the current state of belief.\n    b.  **Identify a Key Uncertainty:** Explicitly name the single biggest gap in knowledge that, if filled, would most significantly update the predictive model. In this instance, the key uncertainty is the government's official position before the Supreme Court.\n    c.  **Target the Source:** Identify the specific document or action that will most directly and efficiently resolve that key uncertainty. Here, the target is clearly the Respondent's Brief on the Merits.\n    d.  **Execute:** Prioritize the next action based on this targeted analysis.\n\nThis new heuristic refines my approach from simply having a good list of strategies to employing a deliberate, sequential process where each action is chosen to provide the maximum possible information gain relative to the current state of uncertainty."

The government's proposed disposition is to Grant, Vacate, and Remand (GVR), and it has stated its intent to waive the deadline on remand. With both parties in complete agreement on the legal issues, there is no longer an adversarial contest.

The central uncertainty that previously defined my predictive model\u2014the government's position\u2014has been definitively resolved. The government has conceded error on both legal questions presented.\n\n*   **Question 1 (Jurisdictional Deadline):** My prior belief, based on the petitioner's brief and recent SCOTUS precedent, was that the petitioner had a very strong argument. This belief is now confirmed and solidified by the government's explicit agreement. The Solicitor General states, \"Petitioner is correct\" that the deadline is not jurisdictional and that the Fourth Circuit's holding \"cannot be reconciled with *Santos-Zacaria v. Garland*... and *Harrow*.\" Crucially, the government notes that *Harrow* was decided after the lower court's ruling, providing a clear basis for the Supreme Court to act. The government's proposed disposition is to Grant, Vacate, and Remand (GVR) for reconsideration in light of *Harrow*. Furthermore, the government has declared its intention to \"waive the application of the 30-day deadline\" on remand, which would effectively resolve the issue in the petitioner's favor. The case is no longer an adversarial dispute on this question; it is a joint agreement that the lower court erred. A GVR is now the overwhelmingly likely outcome.\n\n*   **Question 2 (Final Order of Removal):** My confidence in the petitioner's position, previously based on the characterization of a deep circuit split, is now also confirmed by the government. The respondent's brief again states, \"Petitioner is correct\" that the court of appeals \"erred in holding that the petition for review in this case was untimely.\" The government agrees that a removal determination is not final until the associated withholding-only proceedings are completed, siding with the majority of circuits against the Fourth and Second. The government's brief points out that the Second Circuit, whose precedent the Fourth Circuit relied upon, is already reconsidering its position, further weakening the lower court's reasoning. While the government suggests the Court may not need to reach this question due to the intended waiver on Question 1, the legal consensus between the parties is now total.\n\nMy prediction has shifted from being contingent to being highly certain. The case is no longer about which side will win on the merits, but about the procedural disposition. The most probable outcome is a GVR, correcting the Fourth Circuit's errors without the need for full merits briefing and oral argument.",
          "design_beliefs": "My methodological framework has been powerfully validated and refined by this latest observation. The core principles remain robust, and a new, highly effective heuristic has proven its value.\n\n1.  **Start with the Petition:** Confirmed as the best starting point for understanding the case's legal arguments and posture.\n2.  **Identify Government Concessions:** This heuristic has been upgraded. I now recognize a specific, powerful sub-category: the **\"Confession of Error.\"** When the Solicitor General explicitly agrees with the petitioner that the lower court erred, it is one of the strongest possible signals for predicting a GVR or summary reversal.\n3.  **Track Broader SCOTUS Trends:** Essential. The government's reliance on *Harrow* and *Santos-Zacaria* to concede error demonstrates that placing a case within its jurisprudential context is critical for prediction.\n4.  **Analyze the \"Vehicle\" Argument:** The case's status as a good vehicle was predicated on its clean legal questions. The government's confession of error makes it an even cleaner vehicle for a summary disposition.\n5.  **Quantify and Qualify Circuit Splits:** The petitioner's description of the split on Question 2 was confirmed by the government's brief, validating this as a key data point.\n6.  **Strategic Uncertainty Reduction:** This newly formalized heuristic has proven to be exceptionally effective. The process of (a) pausing to model my beliefs, (b) identifying the government's brief as the key uncertainty, (c) targeting that specific document, and (d) executing the search led to the single most significant information gain possible. This confirms its status as a core component of my research methodology.\n7.  **(New) Model GVR as a Disposition:** I have now learned to explicitly model the Grant, Vacate, and Remand (GVR) procedure as a likely outcome. A confession of error, especially when prompted by recent, intervening Supreme Court precedent (like *Harrow*), is a primary trigger for this disposition. This is a crucial addition to my understanding of Supreme Court practice, moving beyond a simple affirm/reverse binary."

The observation of my own internal reasoning confirms that the information-gathering phase for this task is complete. The central pillar of my prediction remains the government's confession of error, which has transformed the case from an adversarial dispute into a procedural agreement.\n\n*   **Question 1 (Jurisdictional Deadline):** My belief is solidified at near-certainty. The government's concession that the 30-day deadline is a non-jurisdictional, mandatory claims-processing rule is dispositive. The Solicitor General's reliance on the recent, intervening precedent of *Harrow v. Department of Defense* provides the Supreme Court with the exact justification needed for a summary action. The government's explicit proposal to Grant, Vacate, and Remand (GVR) and its stated intent to waive the deadline on remand removes all doubt about the outcome for the petitioner on this question.\n\n*   **Question 2 (Final Order of Removal):** My belief is also solidified at near-certainty. The government's agreement with the petitioner that a removal order is not final until withholding-only proceedings are complete resolves the second question in the petitioner's favor. This concession aligns the government with the majority of circuit courts and against the Fourth Circuit's ruling. While the GVR on Question 1 may render this question moot for the purposes of a final judgment, the legal consensus between the parties is total.\n\n*   **Overall Prediction:** The outcome is no longer a matter of predicting a winner on the merits, but of identifying the procedural disposition. A Grant, Vacate, and Remand (GVR) is the overwhelmingly probable outcome. The case will be sent back to the Fourth Circuit for reconsideration in light of *Harrow*. Given the agreement between the parties, there is virtually no chance of a different result. The expected information gain from any further research into the specifics of this case is now effectively zero.",
          "design_beliefs": "My methodological framework has been tested and validated, and this final internal check adds a crucial capstone principle regarding the termination of inquiry.\n\n1.  **Start with the Petition:** Confirmed as the essential first step for framing the legal questions and initial arguments.\n2.  **Identify Government Concessions / \"Confession of Error\":** This has proven to be the single most powerful predictive heuristic. A confession of error by the Solicitor General, especially one citing recent, intervening SCOTUS precedent, is a near-determinative signal for a GVR or summary reversal. It fundamentally changes the nature of the case.\n3.  **Track Broader SCOTUS Trends:** Essential. The direct impact of *Santos-Zacaria* and, most critically, the post-lower-court decision in *Harrow*, demonstrates that no case can be analyzed in a vacuum. Understanding the Court's recent jurisprudence is key to anticipating how the parties (especially the government) will position themselves.\n4.  **Analyze the \"Vehicle\" Argument:** A case's suitability as a \"vehicle\" is dynamic. Initially a good vehicle for resolving a clean split, this case became an even better vehicle for a summary disposition once the government confessed error.\n5.  **Quantify and Qualify Circuit Splits:** Validated as a crucial data point. The petitioner's framing of the deep split on Question 2 was confirmed by the government, underscoring its importance to the Court's potential interest.\n6.  **Strategic Uncertainty Reduction:** This formalized process\u2014(a) model beliefs, (b) identify key uncertainty (the government's position), (c) target the source (respondent's brief), and (d) execute the search\u2014was exceptionally effective. It led directly to the dispositive piece of evidence.\n7.  **Model GVR as a Disposition:** My predictive toolkit has been expanded. I now understand that a confession of error is a primary trigger for a Grant, Vacate, and Remand disposition, a crucial outcome to model beyond a simple affirm/reverse binary.\n8.  **(New) Recognize Terminal Information States & Conclude Search:** This observation formalizes a critical meta-heuristic. The research process must include a self-monitoring loop to evaluate when the expected information gain from further searching approaches zero. Recognizing a dispositive signal, like a confession of error that resolves the core adversarial conflict, is a trigger to conclude the information-gathering phase and move to final prediction. This prevents inefficient use of resources and marks the formal end of the inquiry."
