    "facts_of_the_case": "True Health Chiropractic, Inc. and McLaughlin Chiropractic Associates, Inc. filed a class action lawsuit against McKesson Corporation and McKesson Technologies, Inc. The plaintiffs alleged that the defendants violated the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA) by sending unsolicited advertisements via fax. They claimed they neither invited nor gave permission to receive these faxes, and even if there was permission or an established business relationship, the faxes lacked the required opt-out notice.\n\nThe district court initially granted summary judgment to the plaintiffs on McKesson's consent defenses. The court also decertified the proposed class and denied treble damages to the plaintiffs. McKesson appealed the summary judgment decision on their consent defenses. The plaintiffs cross-appealed the class decertification and denial of treble damages. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reviewed the summary judgment de novo, the decertification order for abuse of discretion, and the denial of treble damages for abuse of discretion, ultimately affirming all of the district court\u2019s decisions.",

McKesson, and the legal question is whether the Hobbs Act compels a district court to accept the FCC's interpretation of the TCPA. This is a question of administrative law, specifically concerning judicial deference to agency interpretations. My initial belief state is a blank slate for both task parameters (\u03b8) and design effectiveness (D).\n\nTo maximize information gain, I need to learn about both the specifics of this case (\u03b8) and the general principles for predicting this type of case (D).\n\nFor \u03b8 (task-specifics), I need to understand:\n1.  The petitioner's arguments for why the Hobbs Act mandates deference.\n2.  The respondent's counter-arguments.\n3.  The reasoning of the lower courts (Ninth Circuit).\n4.  The specific FCC interpretation at issue.\n\nFor D (general strategies), I need to understand:\n1.  The Supreme Court's current stance on agency deference (e.g., Chevron deference and related doctrines). The question's framing around the Hobbs Act is a specific statutory hook, but it exists within the larger context of the Court's skepticism towards broad agency power.\n2.  How the Hobbs Act typically functions in judicial review of agency actions.\n3.  General predictive factors in administrative law cases (e.g., the role of the Solicitor General, ideological leanings of the justices on agency power).\n\nA good first step is to ground my investigation in the specifics of the case. The most fundamental document that outlines the petitioner's argument and the reason for SCOTUS to take the case is the petition for a writ of certiorari. This will provide a strong foundation for \u03b8 and will likely contain keywords and concepts that I can then use for a more informed meta-level search (D).\n\nTherefore, my first action will be to search the docket files for the petition for certiorari.",

The low EIG scores reflect that this action is about *planning* to gain information, not gaining it directly.

It will directly and authoritatively answer my key questions: what are McLaughlin's core legal arguments, how do they frame the Ninth Circuit's error, and what specific FCC interpretation is at issue? This will move my belief state from a general outline to a detailed understanding of one side of the case, which is a massive information gain.\n\nFor the Design (Design EIG: 0.8), this action serves as a direct and powerful test of my 'Source Prioritization Heuristic.' My current design belief is that the cert petition is the optimal starting point. By executing this action, I will either strongly confirm this heuristic (if the document is as information-dense as expected) or be forced to revise it. This provides significant meta-level information about the most efficient strategy for tackling future SCOTUS prediction tasks, validating a core component of my methodology.\n\nThe Joint EIG is therefore very high because the action is maximally efficient, simultaneously advancing my understanding of the specific problem (the case) and the general problem-solving process (the prediction strategy).",

Carlton & Harris \nChiropractic, Inc. 139 S. Ct. 2051, 2055 (2019). A majority \nof the Court, however, \u201cfound it difficult to answer this \nquestion\u201d because of \u201ctwo preliminary issues\u201d that had \nbeen raised by the petitioner but had not been addressed \nby the court of appeals: (1) whether the FCC order at issue \nwas an \u201cinterpretive rule\u201d such that it might not be subject \nto the Hobbs Act, and (2) whether the Hobbs Act failed to \nafford the petitioner \u201ca \u2018prior\u2019 and \u2018adequate\u2019 opportunity \nfor judicial review\u201d of the order such that the order might \nbe subject to review in an enforcement suit under section \n703 of the Administrative Procedure Act. Id. at 2055\u201356. \nDepending on how these questions might be answered, it \nwas at least possible that the FCC\u2019s interpretation could \nbe challenged in the district court without respect to the \nquestion presented. As a result, the Court remanded so \nthe lower court could consider these two issues in the first \ninstance and did not answer the question presented. \nFour members of the Court, by contrast, would have \nreached \u201cthe question that we granted certiorari to \ndecide.\u201d Id. at 2058 (Kavanaugh, J., concurring). Speaking \non their behalf, Justice Kavanaugh wrote separately to \nexplain that the Hobbs Act \u201cdoes not bar\u201d a party in an \nenforcement suit \u201cfrom arguing that the agency\u2019s \ninterpretation of the statute is wrong.\u201d Id. That conclusion \nflowed, he observed, from a \u201cstraightforward\u201d analysis of \nthe text of the Hobbs Act. Some statutes\u2014like the Clean \nWater Act and Clean Air Act\u2014\u201cexpressly preclude \n\n- 2 - \n \njudicial review in subsequent enforcement actions\u201d and \ntherefore bar parties in those actions from arguing that \nthe agency misinterpreted the statute. Id. at 2059. But \nunlike those statutes, the Hobbs Act is \u201csilent about \nreview in subsequent enforcement actions.\u201d Id. at 2060. So \nthe \u201cgeneral rule of administrative law\u201d kicks in and \nallows a party to argue, and a district court to consider, \nthat the FCC\u2019s interpretation of a statute is wrong. In \nother words, the court is \u201cnot bound by the agency\u2019s \ninterpretation\u201d\u2014a reading of the statute that is \nreinforced by the \u201cserious constitutional issue[s]\u201d raised \nby a rule barring both a party and a district court in an \n\u201cas-applied enforcement action\u201d from entertaining \narguments \u201cabout the reach and authority of agency \nrules.\u201d Id. at 2062. Justice Kavanaugh noted that his \nanalysis of the Hobbs Act\u2019s proper interpretation \n\u201cremains available to other courts in the future.\u201d Id. at \n2058. \nThis case presents an ideal vehicle to resolve the \nquestion presented, but left undecided, in PDR Network. \nLike PDR Network, this case involves an enforcement \naction brought under the TCPA in a federal district court. \nAnd like PDR Network, a party to the action argued that \nan FCC order incorrectly interpreted the TCPA. Both \ncourts below held that such an argument was foreclosed \nby the Hobbs Act. The district court openly \u201cagree[d] with \n\u2026 Justice Kavanaugh\u2019s concurrence in PDR Network,\u201d \nPet. App. 39a n.7, but \u201cNinth Circuit precedent\u201d required \nit to \u201ctreat [the FCC order] as authoritative\u201d because this \nCourt \u201cdid not resolve the central issue presented,\u201d Pet. \nApp. 36a. The Ninth Circuit then refused to revisit its \nposition on appeal. Without even citing PDR Network, it \nheld that the district court was \u201cbound by\u201d the FCC\u2019s \norder under the Hobbs Act. Pet. App. 7a. It then denied \n\n- 3 - \n \nen banc review. The case thus cleanly presents the same \nquestion as in PDR Network. \nUnlike in PDR Network, however, neither of the two \npreliminary issues that thwarted resolution of the central \nquestion pose a barrier to this Court\u2019s review. First, as the \ndistrict court recognized, it \u201cdoes not matter\u201d whether the \nFCC\u2019s order is properly characterized as an \u201cinterpretive \nrule\u201d or a \u201clegislative rule[]\u201d given Ninth Circuit \nprecedent on this question. Pet. App. 37a\u201338a & n.5. While \nother circuits have held that interpretive rules fall outside \nthe Hobbs Act, the Ninth Circuit has held the opposite. \nUnder its caselaw, both interpretive rules and legislative \nrules are subject to the Hobbs Act. So unlike in PDR \nNetwork, the court of appeals here has already spoken on \nthis preliminary issue.  \nSecond, the other preliminary issue poses no barrier \neither. In PDR Network, the petitioner argued that it did \nnot have an \u201cadequate\u201d opportunity under the Hobbs Act \nto challenge the FCC\u2019s order because the order was issued \nmany years before the enforcement action was filed. Were \nthat correct, as this Court noted, section 703 of the APA \nmight permit a later challenge in an enforcement action. \nBut that question is not present here. The petitioner did \nnot argue that it lacked a prior or adequate opportunity to \nseek review of the FCC\u2019s order under the Hobbs Act. \nInstead, the only question that was before the court of \nappeals\u2014and the one that is squarely presented by this \npetition\u2014is whether the Hobbs Act required the district \ncourt to accept the FCC\u2019s interpretation of the TCPA. \nWith no obstacle to review, this Court should take this \ncase to decide the question that it intended to decide in \nPDR Network. Properly construed, the Hobbs Act does \nnot require district courts to give FCC orders \u201cabsolute \n\n- 4 - \n \ndeference\u201d in garden-variety enforcement actions. PDR \nNetwork, 139 S. Ct. at 2066 (Kavanaugh, J., concurring). \nThe Ninth Circuit\u2019s contrary view should be reversed.  \nOPINIONS BELOW \nThe Ninth Circuit\u2019s unreported decision is available at \n2023 WL 7015279 and reproduced at Pet.

On \nMarch 13, 2024, this Court extended the time within which \nto file a petition for a writ of certiorari to May 17, 2024\u2014\n149 days from the date rehearing was denied. This Court\u2019s \njurisdiction is invoked under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254(1). \nCONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY \nPROVISIONS INVOLVED \nThe Hobbs Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2342(1), provides in \nrelevant part: \nThe court of appeals (other than the United States \nCourt of Appeals for the Federal Circuit) has \nexclusive jurisdiction to enjoin, set aside, suspend \n(in whole or in part), or to determine the validity \nof\u2014 \n\n- 5 - \n \n(1) all final orders of the Federal Communication \nCommission made reviewable by section 402(a) of \ntitle 47. \nThe Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991 \n(TCPA), Pub. L. No. 102-243, 105 Stat. 2394, as amended \nby the Junk Fax Prevention Act of 2005, Pub. L. No. 109-\n21, 119 Stat. 359, is codified at 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 227(a)(3) and \nprovides in relevant part: \nThe term \u201ctelephone facsimile machine\u201d means \nequipment which has the capacity (A) to transcribe \ntext or images, or both, from paper into an \nelectronic signal and to transmit that signal over a \nregular telephone line, or (B) to transcribe text or \nimages (or both) from an electronic signal received \nover a regular telephone line onto paper. \nSTATEMENT \nI.  Factual background \nA. The Telephone Consumer Protection Act \nprohibits the sending of unsolicited \nadvertisements via fax.  \nCongress passed the TCPA in response to the public\u2019s \n\u201coutrage[] over the proliferation of intrusive, nuisance \ncalls.\u201d 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 227 note.1 As amended by the Junk Fax \nPrevention Act, Pub. L. No. 109-21, 119 Stat. 359, the law \ntargets \u201ca number of problems associated with junk \nfaxes.\u201d Imhoff Inv., LLC v. Alfoccino, Inc., 792 F.3d 627, \n633 (6th Cir. 2015). Junk faxes often force the recipient, \nfrequently small businesses, to incur significant costs in \n \n1 Unless otherwise specified, all internal quotation marks, \nemphases, alterations, and citations are omitted from quotations \nthroughout. \n\n- 6 - \n \nthe form of \u201cpaper and ink\u201d and \u201ctied up\u201d fax lines, id., \nwhile also \u201cinterrupt[ing] the recipient\u2019s privacy\u201d and \nplacing unnecessary stress on the \u201crecipient\u2019s fax \nmachines.\u201d ER415.  \nFor these reasons, Congress made it unlawful \u201cto use \nany telephone facsimile machine, computer, or other \ndevice to send, to a telephone facsimile machine, an \nunsolicited advertisement.\u201d 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 227(b)(1)(C). And \nit broadly defined the term \u201ctelephone facsimile machine\u201d \nto include any \u201cequipment which has the capacity (A) to \ntranscribe text or images, or both, from paper into an \nelectronic signal and to transmit that signal over a regular \ntelephone line, or (B) to transcribe text or images (or both) \nfrom an electronic signal received over a regular \ntelephone line onto paper.\u201d Id. \u00a7 227(a)(3).  \nIn the years since the TCPA was amended to prohibit \nusing fax machines to send unsolicited advertisements, \nintrepid marketers have shifted much of their advertising \ncampaigns online. But as both the FCC and courts have \nlong explained, the TCPA\u2019s bar on unsolicited faxes \nextends to cover faxes sent from and to \u201ccomputerized\u201d \nfax machines, which qualify as a \u201ctelephone facsimile \nmachine\u201d under the statute. See In re Rules & Regs. \nImplementing the Tel. Consumer Prot. Act of 1991, 68 FR \n44144-01, \u00b6 143 (FCC July 25, 2003).  \nThat is because the TCPA \u201cbroadly applies to any \nequipment that has the capacity to send or receive text or \nimages,\u201d which \u201censure[s] that the prohibition on \nunsolicited faxing\u201d cannot be easily circumvented as \ntechnology changes. Id. at \u00b6 144 (emphasis added) (noting \nthat \u201cCongress could not have intended to allow easy \ncircumvention of its prohibition when faxes are . . . \ntransmitted to personal computers and fax servers, rather \n\n- 7 - \n \nthan traditional stand-alone facsimile machines\u201d); see also \nid. \u00b6 145 (noting that unsolicited faxes sent to a recipient\u2019s \n\u201cinbox\u201d still risk \u201cshift[ing] the advertising cost of paper \nand toner to the recipient\u201d and \u201cmay also tie up lines and \nprinters so that the recipients\u2019 requested faxes are not \ntimely received\u201d); see also Lyngaas v. Curaden AG, 992 \nF.3d 412, 426 (6th Cir. 2021) (holding that the TCPA\u2019s \ndefinition of \u201ctelephone facsimile machine\u201d \u201cencompasses \nmore than traditional fax machines\u201d and includes any \n\u201cequipment that has the capacity to transcribe text or \nimages from or onto paper\u2014as long as the electronic \nsignal is transmitted or received over a telephone line\u201d); \nMeyer v. Portfolio Recovery Assocs., LLC, 707 F.3d 1036, \n1043 (9th Cir. 2012) (similar for \u201cautomatic telephone \ndialing system\u201d).   \nB. McKesson sends unsolicited advertisements via \nfax in violation of the TCPA.   \nMcKesson Corporation is a publicly traded company \nwith hundreds of subsidiaries or affiliated companies and \nbusinesses that range from the sale of pharmaceuticals to \nbehavioral coaching and information technology. ER4. \nOne of its business units, Physician Practice Solutions, \nregularly engages in promotional fax campaigns designed \nto \u201cmarket its products and services\u201d to physician \npractices throughout the country. ER8. To carry out this \nmarketing, McKesson \u201cemployed a fax broadcasting \ncompany\u201d to transmit faxes. ER6.  \nMcLaughlin Chiropractic Associates is one of the \nphysician practices targeted by McKesson. ER4. In 2009 \nand 2010, it, along with many other small medical \npractices, received multiple unsolicited advertisements \nvia fax from McKesson. ER417. These advertisements\u2014\nsome of which were received on stand-alone fax machines \n\n- 8 - \n \nand some of which were received through online fax \nservices\u2014marketed certain software products that \nMcKesson sold. ER5.   \nMcKesson was not unaware that engaging in this type \nof advertising campaign risked violating the TCPA. A \nyear earlier, in 2008, it was warned by the FCC that it had \n\u201csent one or more unsolicited advertisements\u201d via fax \u201cin \nviolation of the TCPA.\u201d ER4\u20135. The FCC issued \nMcKesson an \u201cofficial CITATION\u201d and notified the \ncompany that, in the future, it would bear the burden to \nshow that it had complied with the TCPA in the event of \nany \u201ccomplaint or dispute.\u201d ER5.  \nII. Procedural background \nA. Having received the unlawful faxes, McLaughlin \nChiropractic \nand \nanother \npractice, \nTrue \nHealth \nChiropractic, Inc., sued McKesson on behalf of themselves \nand a proposed class for sending unsolicited fax \nadvertisements in violation of the TCPA, 47 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 227(b)(1)(C). ER450.  \nAfter several years of litigation and an appeal to the \nNinth Circuit from the denial of class certification, True \nHealth Chiropractic, Inc. v. McKesson Corp., 896 F.3d 923 \n(9th Cir. 2018), the district court eventually certified a \nsingle class of all persons or entities whose fax numbers \nhad been previously identified and \u201cwho received faxes \nfrom McKesson from September 2, 2009, to May 11, 2010\u201d \noffering various promotional products and services \nwithout being notified of their right to opt out of future \nfaxes. ER71. It appointed McLaughlin Chiropractic\u2014the \npetitioner here\u2014to represent the class. Id. \nB. Shortly after the class was certified\u2014six years into \nthe litigation\u2014the FCC issued an order interpreting the \n\n- 9 - \n \ntext of the TCPA provision at issue here. See Pet. App. \n46a. In this so-called Amerifactors order, the FCC \nconstrued the TCPA to exclude an \u201conline fax service\u201d \nfrom the definition of \u201ctelephone facsimile machine.\u201d Pet. \nApp. 48a. In the FCC\u2019s view, an \u201conline fax service that \neffectively receives faxes sent as email over the Internet\u201d \nis \u201cnot itself equipment which has the capacity to \ntranscribe text or images (or both) from an electronic \nsignal received over a regular telephone line onto paper\u201d \nand so \u201cfalls outside the scope of the statutory \nprohibition.\u201d Id. The FCC further reasoned that, because \nan online fax service \u201ccannot itself print a fax,\u201d it did not \nimplicate the specific harms Congress addressed in the \nTCPA, namely \u201cadvertiser cost-shifting.\u201d Pet. App. 52a\u2013\n53a. An application for review of the order was filed before \nthe FCC in early 2020 by other entities. SER121. Four \nyears later, the FCC has yet to act on it.  \nC. The FCC\u2019s intervening order forced the district \ncourt to address what impact, if any, it had on this case. \nAlthough the court \u201cagree[d] with the reasoning of Justice \nKavanaugh\u2019s concurrence in PDR,\u201d it recognized that \n\u201cthese questions are obviously for another day, and for a \nhigher court than this one.\u201d Pet. App. 39a n.7. That was \nbecause, \u201cunder Ninth Circuit precedent,\u201d the court was \nrequired to \u201ctreat Amerifactors as authoritative.\u201d Pet. \nApp. 36a. \nIn reaching that conclusion, the district court rejected \nthe argument that the Amerifactors order was an \n\u201cinterpretive rule\u201d that falls outside the scope of the \nHobbs Act. Pet. App. 37a\u201338a. \u201cEven assuming (without \ndeciding)\u201d that this \u201ccharacterization of Amerifactors\u201d \nwas correct, the court wrote, it \u201cdoes not matter.\u201d Id. \nUnder controlling Ninth Circuit caselaw, so long as the \n\n- 10 - \n \nrelevant FCC order is \u201cfinal,\u201d the Hobbs Act applies \nregardless of whether the order is characterized as \n\u201clegislative\u201d or \u201cinterpretive.\u201d Id. (noting that the Ninth \nCircuit held, in U.S. W. Commc\u2019ns, Inc. v. Hamilton, 224 \nF.3d 1049, 1055 (9th Cir. 2000), that the Hobbs Act \n\u201ccontains no exception for \u2018interpretive\u2019 rules, and case \nlaw does not create one\u201d). As a result, according to the \ndistrict court, the Amerifactors order was \u201ca final, binding \norder for purposes of the Hobbs Act.\u201d Id. \nThe district court also held that it did not matter that \nan application for review of the Amerifactors order was \npending before the FCC. According to both FCC \nregulations and case law, reconsideration petitions do \u201cnot \naffect the order\u2019s finality as it applies to [a defendant\u2019s] \npotential liability under the TCPA.\u201d Id. (citing 47 C.F.R. \n\u00a7 1.102(b)(1); Comm. To Save WEAM v. FCC, 808 F.2d \n113, 119 (D.C. Cir. 1986)).  \nUltimately, although the district court recognized the \nneed for \u201ccritical guidance\u201d on whether, in light of PDR \nNetwork, an FCC order like Amerifactors could bind \nfederal district courts in enforcement proceedings, it \nobserved that \u201cAmerifactors changed the landscape for \nTCPA litigation,\u201d and \u201cNinth Circuit precedent\u201d required \ncourts to \u201cfollow the FCC\u2019s interpretation.\u201d Pet. App. 20a. \nThat meant two things for this case: First, because the \nFCC\u2019s Amerifactors order was \u201cdeterminative of the \nviability of this case,\u201d the court held that it was required \nto apply the order retroactively and to decertify the class \non that basis. Id. Second, it also required the entry of \nsummary judgment in favor of McKesson for those claims \ninvolving the receipt of faxes via an \u201conline fax service.\u201d \nER20\u201321.  \n\n- 11 - \n \nD. The Ninth Circuit affirmed. Without citing or \ndiscussing PDR Network, it held that the district court \n\u201ccorrectly found that that it was bound by the [FCC\u2019s] \nAmerifactors declaratory ruling, which determined that \nthe TCPA does not apply to faxes received through an \nonline fax service.\u201d Pet. App. 7a. That was so, in the Ninth \nCircuit\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

Carlton & Harris \nChiropractic, Inc. 139 S. Ct. 2051, 2055 (2019). A majority \nof the Court, however, \u201cfound it difficult to answer this \nquestion\u201d because of \u201ctwo preliminary issues\u201d that had \nbeen raised by the petitioner but had not been addressed \nby the court of appeals: (1) whether the FCC order at issue \nwas an \u201cinterpretive rule\u201d such that it might not be subject \nto the Hobbs Act, and (2) whether the Hobbs Act failed to \nafford the petitioner \u201ca \u2018prior\u2019 and \u2018adequate\u2019 opportunity \nfor judicial review\u201d of the order such that the order might \nbe subject to review in an enforcement suit under section \n703 of the Administrative Procedure Act. Id. at 2055\u201356. \nDepending on how these questions might be answered, it \nwas at least possible that the FCC\u2019s interpretation could \nbe challenged in the district court without respect to the \nquestion presented. As a result, the Court remanded so \nthe lower court could consider these two issues in the first \ninstance and did not answer the question presented. \nFour members of the Court, by contrast, would have \nreached \u201cthe question that we granted certiorari to \ndecide.\u201d Id. at 2058 (Kavanaugh, J., concurring). Speaking \non their behalf, Justice Kavanaugh wrote separately to \nexplain that the Hobbs Act \u201cdoes not bar\u201d a party in an \nenforcement suit \u201cfrom arguing that the agency\u2019s \ninterpretation of the statute is wrong.\u201d Id. That conclusion \nflowed, he observed, from a \u201cstraightforward\u201d analysis of \nthe text of the Hobbs Act. Some statutes\u2014like the Clean \nWater Act and Clean Air Act\u2014\u201cexpressly preclude \n\n- 2 - \n \njudicial review in subsequent enforcement actions\u201d and \ntherefore bar parties in those actions from arguing that \nthe agency misinterpreted the statute. Id. at 2059. But \nunlike those statutes, the Hobbs Act is \u201csilent about \nreview in subsequent enforcement actions.\u201d Id. at 2060. So \nthe \u201cgeneral rule of administrative law\u201d kicks in and \nallows a party to argue, and a district court to consider, \nthat the FCC\u2019s interpretation of a statute is wrong. In \nother words, the court is \u201cnot bound by the agency\u2019s \ninterpretation\u201d\u2014a reading of the statute that is \nreinforced by the \u201cserious constitutional issue[s]\u201d raised \nby a rule barring both a party and a district court in an \n\u201cas-applied enforcement action\u201d from entertaining \narguments \u201cabout the reach and authority of agency \nrules.\u201d Id. at 2062. Justice Kavanaugh noted that his \nanalysis of the Hobbs Act\u2019s proper interpretation \n\u201cremains available to other courts in the future.\u201d Id. at \n2058. \nThis case presents an ideal vehicle to resolve the \nquestion presented, but left undecided, in PDR Network. \nLike PDR Network, this case involves an enforcement \naction brought under the TCPA in a federal district court. \nAnd like PDR Network, a party to the action argued that \nan FCC order incorrectly interpreted the TCPA. Both \ncourts below held that such an argument was foreclosed \nby the Hobbs Act. The district court openly \u201cagree[d] with \n\u2026 Justice Kavanaugh\u2019s concurrence in PDR Network,\u201d \nPet. App. 39a n.7, but \u201cNinth Circuit precedent\u201d required \nit to \u201ctreat [the FCC order] as authoritative\u201d because this \nCourt \u201cdid not resolve the central issue presented,\u201d Pet. \nApp. 36a. The Ninth Circuit then refused to revisit its \nposition on appeal. Without even citing PDR Network, it \nheld that the district court was \u201cbound by\u201d the FCC\u2019s \norder under the Hobbs Act. Pet. App. 7a. It then denied \n\n- 3 - \n \nen banc review. The case thus cleanly presents the same \nquestion as in PDR Network. \nUnlike in PDR Network, however, neither of the two \npreliminary issues that thwarted resolution of the central \nquestion pose a barrier to this Court\u2019s review. First, as the \ndistrict court recognized, it \u201cdoes not matter\u201d whether the \nFCC\u2019s order is properly characterized as an \u201cinterpretive \nrule\u201d or a \u201clegislative rule[]\u201d given Ninth Circuit \nprecedent on this question. Pet. App. 37a\u201338a & n.5. While \nother circuits have held that interpretive rules fall outside \nthe Hobbs Act, the Ninth Circuit has held the opposite. \nUnder its caselaw, both interpretive rules and legislative \nrules are subject to the Hobbs Act. So unlike in PDR \nNetwork, the court of appeals here has already spoken on \nthis preliminary issue.  \nSecond, the other preliminary issue poses no barrier \neither. In PDR Network, the petitioner argued that it did \nnot have an \u201cadequate\u201d opportunity under the Hobbs Act \nto challenge the FCC\u2019s order because the order was issued \nmany years before the enforcement action was filed. Were \nthat correct, as this Court noted, section 703 of the APA \nmight permit a later challenge in an enforcement action. \nBut that question is not present here. The petitioner did \nnot argue that it lacked a prior or adequate opportunity to \nseek review of the FCC\u2019s order under the Hobbs Act. \nInstead, the only question that was before the court of \nappeals\u2014and the one that is squarely presented by this \npetition\u2014is whether the Hobbs Act required the district \ncourt to accept the FCC\u2019s interpretation of the TCPA. \nWith no obstacle to review, this Court should take this \ncase to decide the question that it intended to decide in \nPDR Network. Properly construed, the Hobbs Act does \nnot require district courts to give FCC orders \u201cabsolute \n\n- 4 - \n \ndeference\u201d in garden-variety enforcement actions. PDR \nNetwork, 139 S. Ct. at 2066 (Kavanaugh, J., concurring). \nThe Ninth Circuit\u2019s contrary view should be reversed.  \nOPINIONS BELOW \nThe Ninth Circuit\u2019s unreported decision is available at \n2023 WL 7015279 and reproduced at Pet.

On \nMarch 13, 2024, this Court extended the time within which \nto file a petition for a writ of certiorari to May 17, 2024\u2014\n149 days from the date rehearing was denied. This Court\u2019s \njurisdiction is invoked under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254(1). \nCONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY \nPROVISIONS INVOLVED \nThe Hobbs Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2342(1), provides in \nrelevant part: \nThe court of appeals (other than the United States \nCourt of Appeals for the Federal Circuit) has \nexclusive jurisdiction to enjoin, set aside, suspend \n(in whole or in part), or to determine the validity \nof\u2014 \n\n- 5 - \n \n(1) all final orders of the Federal Communication \nCommission made reviewable by section 402(a) of \ntitle 47. \nThe Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991 \n(TCPA), Pub. L. No. 102-243, 105 Stat. 2394, as amended \nby the Junk Fax Prevention Act of 2005, Pub. L. No. 109-\n21, 119 Stat. 359, is codified at 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 227(a)(3) and \nprovides in relevant part: \nThe term \u201ctelephone facsimile machine\u201d means \nequipment which has the capacity (A) to transcribe \ntext or images, or both, from paper into an \nelectronic signal and to transmit that signal over a \nregular telephone line, or (B) to transcribe text or \nimages (or both) from an electronic signal received \nover a regular telephone line onto paper. \nSTATEMENT \nI.  Factual background \nA. The Telephone Consumer Protection Act \nprohibits the sending of unsolicited \nadvertisements via fax.  \nCongress passed the TCPA in response to the public\u2019s \n\u201coutrage[] over the proliferation of intrusive, nuisance \ncalls.\u201d 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 227 note.1 As amended by the Junk Fax \nPrevention Act, Pub. L. No. 109-21, 119 Stat. 359, the law \ntargets \u201ca number of problems associated with junk \nfaxes.\u201d Imhoff Inv., LLC v. Alfoccino, Inc., 792 F.3d 627, \n633 (6th Cir. 2015). Junk faxes often force the recipient, \nfrequently small businesses, to incur significant costs in \n \n1 Unless otherwise specified, all internal quotation marks, \nemphases, alterations, and citations are omitted from quotations \nthroughout. \n\n- 6 - \n \nthe form of \u201cpaper and ink\u201d and \u201ctied up\u201d fax lines, id., \nwhile also \u201cinterrupt[ing] the recipient\u2019s privacy\u201d and \nplacing unnecessary stress on the \u201crecipient\u2019s fax \nmachines.\u201d ER415.  \nFor these reasons, Congress made it unlawful \u201cto use \nany telephone facsimile machine, computer, or other \ndevice to send, to a telephone facsimile machine, an \nunsolicited advertisement.\u201d 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 227(b)(1)(C). And \nit broadly defined the term \u201ctelephone facsimile machine\u201d \nto include any \u201cequipment which has the capacity (A) to \ntranscribe text or images, or both, from paper into an \nelectronic signal and to transmit that signal over a regular \ntelephone line, or (B) to transcribe text or images (or both) \nfrom an electronic signal received over a regular \ntelephone line onto paper.\u201d Id. \u00a7 227(a)(3).  \nIn the years since the TCPA was amended to prohibit \nusing fax machines to send unsolicited advertisements, \nintrepid marketers have shifted much of their advertising \ncampaigns online. But as both the FCC and courts have \nlong explained, the TCPA\u2019s bar on unsolicited faxes \nextends to cover faxes sent from and to \u201ccomputerized\u201d \nfax machines, which qualify as a \u201ctelephone facsimile \nmachine\u201d under the statute. See In re Rules & Regs. \nImplementing the Tel. Consumer Prot. Act of 1991, 68 FR \n44144-01, \u00b6 143 (FCC July 25, 2003).  \nThat is because the TCPA \u201cbroadly applies to any \nequipment that has the capacity to send or receive text or \nimages,\u201d which \u201censure[s] that the prohibition on \nunsolicited faxing\u201d cannot be easily circumvented as \ntechnology changes. Id. at \u00b6 144 (emphasis added) (noting \nthat \u201cCongress could not have intended to allow easy \ncircumvention of its prohibition when faxes are . . . \ntransmitted to personal computers and fax servers, rather \n\n- 7 - \n \nthan traditional stand-alone facsimile machines\u201d); see also \nid. \u00b6 145 (noting that unsolicited faxes sent to a recipient\u2019s \n\u201cinbox\u201d still risk \u201cshift[ing] the advertising cost of paper \nand toner to the recipient\u201d and \u201cmay also tie up lines and \nprinters so that the recipients\u2019 requested faxes are not \ntimely received\u201d); see also Lyngaas v. Curaden AG, 992 \nF.3d 412, 426 (6th Cir. 2021) (holding that the TCPA\u2019s \ndefinition of \u201ctelephone facsimile machine\u201d \u201cencompasses \nmore than traditional fax machines\u201d and includes any \n\u201cequipment that has the capacity to transcribe text or \nimages from or onto paper\u2014as long as the electronic \nsignal is transmitted or received over a telephone line\u201d); \nMeyer v. Portfolio Recovery Assocs., LLC, 707 F.3d 1036, \n1043 (9th Cir. 2012) (similar for \u201cautomatic telephone \ndialing system\u201d).   \nB. McKesson sends unsolicited advertisements via \nfax in violation of the TCPA.   \nMcKesson Corporation is a publicly traded company \nwith hundreds of subsidiaries or affiliated companies and \nbusinesses that range from the sale of pharmaceuticals to \nbehavioral coaching and information technology. ER4. \nOne of its business units, Physician Practice Solutions, \nregularly engages in promotional fax campaigns designed \nto \u201cmarket its products and services\u201d to physician \npractices throughout the country. ER8. To carry out this \nmarketing, McKesson \u201cemployed a fax broadcasting \ncompany\u201d to transmit faxes. ER6.  \nMcLaughlin Chiropractic Associates is one of the \nphysician practices targeted by McKesson. ER4. In 2009 \nand 2010, it, along with many other small medical \npractices, received multiple unsolicited advertisements \nvia fax from McKesson. ER417. These advertisements\u2014\nsome of which were received on stand-alone fax machines \n\n- 8 - \n \nand some of which were received through online fax \nservices\u2014marketed certain software products that \nMcKesson sold. ER5.   \nMcKesson was not unaware that engaging in this type \nof advertising campaign risked violating the TCPA. A \nyear earlier, in 2008, it was warned by the FCC that it had \n\u201csent one or more unsolicited advertisements\u201d via fax \u201cin \nviolation of the TCPA.\u201d ER4\u20135. The FCC issued \nMcKesson an \u201cofficial CITATION\u201d and notified the \ncompany that, in the future, it would bear the burden to \nshow that it had complied with the TCPA in the event of \nany \u201ccomplaint or dispute.\u201d ER5.  \nII. Procedural background \nA. Having received the unlawful faxes, McLaughlin \nChiropractic \nand \nanother \npractice, \nTrue \nHealth \nChiropractic, Inc., sued McKesson on behalf of themselves \nand a proposed class for sending unsolicited fax \nadvertisements in violation of the TCPA, 47 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 227(b)(1)(C). ER450.  \nAfter several years of litigation and an appeal to the \nNinth Circuit from the denial of class certification, True \nHealth Chiropractic, Inc. v. McKesson Corp., 896 F.3d 923 \n(9th Cir. 2018), the district court eventually certified a \nsingle class of all persons or entities whose fax numbers \nhad been previously identified and \u201cwho received faxes \nfrom McKesson from September 2, 2009, to May 11, 2010\u201d \noffering various promotional products and services \nwithout being notified of their right to opt out of future \nfaxes. ER71. It appointed McLaughlin Chiropractic\u2014the \npetitioner here\u2014to represent the class. Id. \nB. Shortly after the class was certified\u2014six years into \nthe litigation\u2014the FCC issued an order interpreting the \n\n- 9 - \n \ntext of the TCPA provision at issue here. See Pet. App. \n46a. In this so-called Amerifactors order, the FCC \nconstrued the TCPA to exclude an \u201conline fax service\u201d \nfrom the definition of \u201ctelephone facsimile machine.\u201d Pet. \nApp. 48a. In the FCC\u2019s view, an \u201conline fax service that \neffectively receives faxes sent as email over the Internet\u201d \nis \u201cnot itself equipment which has the capacity to \ntranscribe text or images (or both) from an electronic \nsignal received over a regular telephone line onto paper\u201d \nand so \u201cfalls outside the scope of the statutory \nprohibition.\u201d Id. The FCC further reasoned that, because \nan online fax service \u201ccannot itself print a fax,\u201d it did not \nimplicate the specific harms Congress addressed in the \nTCPA, namely \u201cadvertiser cost-shifting.\u201d Pet. App. 52a\u2013\n53a. An application for review of the order was filed before \nthe FCC in early 2020 by other entities. SER121. Four \nyears later, the FCC has yet to act on it.  \nC. The FCC\u2019s intervening order forced the district \ncourt to address what impact, if any, it had on this case. \nAlthough the court \u201cagree[d] with the reasoning of Justice \nKavanaugh\u2019s concurrence in PDR,\u201d it recognized that \n\u201cthese questions are obviously for another day, and for a \nhigher court than this one.\u201d Pet. App. 39a n.7. That was \nbecause, \u201cunder Ninth Circuit precedent,\u201d the court was \nrequired to \u201ctreat Amerifactors as authoritative.\u201d Pet. \nApp. 36a. \nIn reaching that conclusion, the district court rejected \nthe argument that the Amerifactors order was an \n\u201cinterpretive rule\u201d that falls outside the scope of the \nHobbs Act. Pet. App. 37a\u201338a. \u201cEven assuming (without \ndeciding)\u201d that this \u201ccharacterization of Amerifactors\u201d \nwas correct, the court wrote, it \u201cdoes not matter.\u201d Id. \nUnder controlling Ninth Circuit caselaw, so long as the \n\n- 10 - \n \nrelevant FCC order is \u201cfinal,\u201d the Hobbs Act applies \nregardless of whether the order is characterized as \n\u201clegislative\u201d or \u201cinterpretive.\u201d Id. (noting that the Ninth \nCircuit held, in U.S. W. Commc\u2019ns, Inc. v. Hamilton, 224 \nF.3d 1049, 1055 (9th Cir. 2000), that the Hobbs Act \n\u201ccontains no exception for \u2018interpretive\u2019 rules, and case \nlaw does not create one\u201d). As a result, according to the \ndistrict court, the Amerifactors order was \u201ca final, binding \norder for purposes of the Hobbs Act.\u201d Id. \nThe district court also held that it did not matter that \nan application for review of the Amerifactors order was \npending before the FCC. According to both FCC \nregulations and case law, reconsideration petitions do \u201cnot \naffect the order\u2019s finality as it applies to [a defendant\u2019s] \npotential liability under the TCPA.\u201d Id. (citing 47 C.F.R. \n\u00a7 1.102(b)(1); Comm. To Save WEAM v. FCC, 808 F.2d \n113, 119 (D.C. Cir. 1986)).  \nUltimately, although the district court recognized the \nneed for \u201ccritical guidance\u201d on whether, in light of PDR \nNetwork, an FCC order like Amerifactors could bind \nfederal district courts in enforcement proceedings, it \nobserved that \u201cAmerifactors changed the landscape for \nTCPA litigation,\u201d and \u201cNinth Circuit precedent\u201d required \ncourts to \u201cfollow the FCC\u2019s interpretation.\u201d Pet. App. 20a. \nThat meant two things for this case: First, because the \nFCC\u2019s Amerifactors order was \u201cdeterminative of the \nviability of this case,\u201d the court held that it was required \nto apply the order retroactively and to decertify the class \non that basis. Id. Second, it also required the entry of \nsummary judgment in favor of McKesson for those claims \ninvolving the receipt of faxes via an \u201conline fax service.\u201d \nER20\u201321.  \n\n- 11 - \n \nD. The Ninth Circuit affirmed. Without citing or \ndiscussing PDR Network, it held that the district court \n\u201ccorrectly found that that it was bound by the [FCC\u2019s] \nAmerifactors declaratory ruling, which determined that \nthe TCPA does not apply to faxes received through an \nonline fax service.\u201d Pet. App. 7a. That was so, in the Ninth \nCircuit\u2019s view, because the Hobbs Act\u2019s exclusive-\njurisdiction \nprovision\u2014which \n\u201cencompasses \n\u2018any \nproceeding to enjoin, set aside, annul, or suspend any \norder\u2019\u201d of the FCC\u2014forecloses a district court in any \nenforcement action from even considering whether the \nagency\u2019s interpretation of the TCPA is wrong. Pet. App. \n7a. The Ninth Circuit also confirmed that the FCC\u2019s \nAmerifactors decision was both an \u201corder\u201d of the FCC and \n\u201cfinal.\u201d Pet. App. 7a\u20139a. And the Ninth Circuit refused to \nrevisit its prior caselaw; despite the availability of Justice \nKavanaugh\u2019s analysis in PDR Network, it denied without \ncomment a petition for rehearing en banc. Pet. App. 2a. \nREASONS FOR GRANTING THE PETITION \nAs the district court in this case correctly recognized, \nwhether the Hobbs Act requires federal courts to treat an \nagency\u2019s legal interpretation of a federal statute as \n\u201cinvariably binding\u201d is a question that is in dire need of \n\u201ccritical guidance\u201d from a \u201chigher court.\u201d Pet. App. 20a, \n39a n.7. Five years ago, this Court planned to do just that \nwhen it granted review in PDR Network. But two \n\u201cpreliminary issues\u201d frustrated that plan, and the full \nCourt never reached the question. Since then, the \ndisagreement among the circuits over whether the Hobbs \nAct binds districts courts to FCC interpretations of the \nTCPA shows no sign of letting up, leading some judges to \ncall for a definitive resolution in \u201cthe earliest appropriate \n\n- 12 - \n \ncase.\u201d Gorss Motels, Inc. v. Safemark Sys., LP, 931 F.3d \n1094, 1106 (11th Cir. 2019) (Pryor, J., concurring). \nThis is that case. The question presented here is \nidentical to the one this Court granted certiorari to decide \nin PDR Network but did not ultimately resolve. It was \nsquarely raised and passed on below, with the district \ncourt even acknowledging that its resolution was \n\u201cdeterminative of the viability of this case.\u201d Pet. App. 20. \nAnd, perhaps most importantly, neither of the two \nthreshold issues this Court identified in PDR Network \nposes an obstacle to review. In the Ninth Circuit, even \ninterpretive rules fall within the scope of the Hobbs Act, \nthus binding a district court, and the prior adequacy of \nHobbs Act review is not at issue in this appeal. This Court \nshould grant review to decide the question it did not reach \nin PDR Network.   \nI. \nThe question the Court granted certiorari to \ndecide in PDR Network remains certworthy.   \nThe five years since this Court granted certiorari in \nPDR Network have done nothing but increase the need for \nreview of the question presented.  \nA. At the time this Court granted review in PDR \nNetwork, the circuits were already split over whether the \nHobbs Act requires district courts adjudicating cases \nwithin their ordinary jurisdiction to treat FCC orders that \ninterpret the TCPA as binding precedent.  \nOn one side, the Fourth Circuit, Ninth Circuit, and \nEleventh Circuit all interpreted the Hobbs Act as \n\u201cunambiguously depriv[ing]\u201d the federal district courts of \nthe authority to question FCC orders even in private \nenforce proceedings. Carlton & Harris Chiropractic, Inc. \nv. PDR Network, LLC, 883 F.3d 459, 469 (4th Cir. 2018) \n\n- 13 - \n \n(stating that \u201cthe Hobbs Act requires a district court to \nfollow FCC interpretations of the TCPA\u201d); see also \nWilson v. A.H. Belo Cop., 87 F.3d 393, 400 (9th Cir. 1996) \n(holding that the Hobbs Act forecloses a district court \nfrom \u201cdisagree[ing]\u201d with any FCC order in a private \nTCPA enforcement action); Mais v. Gulf Coast Collection \nBureau, 768 F.3d 1110, 1120 (11th Cir. 2014) (ruling that \na district court \u201cexceed[s] its jurisdiction\u201d if it decides that \nan FCC order is \u201cinconsistent with the TCPA\u201d \n\u201c[r]egardless of which party invoke[s]\u201d the order or if the \nchallenge \u201carises in a dispute between private parties\u201d). \nOn the other side, the Second Circuit, Sixth Circuit, \nand Seventh Circuits all recognize that parties in a private \nenforcement action may challenge FCC interpretations of \nthe TCPA. In these circuits, federal courts remain free to \nconsider such challenges under the usual principles of \nstatutory interpretation, affording appropriate respect to \nthe agency\u2019s interpretation. See Physicians Healthsource, \nInc. v. Boehringer Ingelheim Pharms., Inc., 847 F.3d 92, \n95 (2d Cir. 2017) (determining whether an FCC rule \n\u201ccomports with the [TCPA]\u201d before concluding what \neffect it should have in a private enforcement action); \nSandusky Wellness Ctr., LLC v. Medco Health Sols., Inc., \n788 F.3d 218, 223 (6th Cir. 2015) (recognizing a \u201ccircuit \nsplit\u201d on \u201cwhether to defer\u201d to the FCC\u2019s interpretation of \nthe TCPA in a private enforcement action and choosing to \n\u201cnot defer to the agency\u2019s interpretation\u201d); Ira Holtzman, \nC.P.A. v. Turza, 728 F.3d 682, 688 (7th Cir. 2013) \n(rejecting an FCC interpretation of the TCPA in a private \nenforcement action).  \nThat even split justified the Court\u2019s grant of certiorari \nof the question five years ago in PDR Network.   \n\n- 14 - \n \nB. Since then, the disagreement among the circuits has \nonly grown. Not only does the original split remain, but \nthe circuits have now taken different views on whether the \nHobbs Act extends even to FCC interpretative rules.   \nThe Fourth Circuit was the first to weigh in. On \nremand in PDR Network, the court focused on the first \n\u201cpreliminary issue[]\u201d flagged in this Court\u2019s opinion and \nheld that the FCC rule at issue in the case was \n\u201cinterpretive,\u201d rather than \u201clegislative.\u201d Carlton & Harris \nChiropractic, Inc. v. PDR Network, LLC, 982 F.3d 258, \n262\u201363 (4th Cir. 2020). And because interpretive rules \u201cdo \nnot have the force and effect of law and are not accorded \nthat weight in the adjudicatory process,\u201d the Fourth \nCircuit held that they therefore fall outside the scope of \nthe Hobbs Act and cannot bind district courts in private \nenforcement proceedings. Id. at 264 (holding that, because \nthe \u201cFCC Rule is interpretive,\u201d the \u201cdistrict court wasn\u2019t \nbound by it\u201d). \nSeveral other circuits have followed suit. For example, \nafter recognizing that this Court in PDR Network \n\u201csuggested that the FCC\u2019s interpretive rulings may not \nbind courts when they construe the TCPA,\u201d the Third \nCircuit refused to treat such rulings as binding authority. \nPanzarella v. Navient Sols., Inc., 37 F.4th 867, 873 n.7 (3d \nCir. 2022). The Second and Eighth Circuits have done the \nsame. See Gorss Motels, Inc. v. Lands\u2019 End, Inc., 997 F.3d \n470, 477 n.4 (2d Cir. 2021) (finding the FCC\u2019s \ninterpretation \u201cpersuasive\u201d only after independently \ninterpreting the statutory text); Golan v. FreeEats.com, \nInc., 930 F.3d 950, 960 n.8 (8th Cir. 2019) (\u201cWe agree with \nthe FCC not because we believe we are bound to do so but \nbecause we find this portion of their interpretation of the \nstatute to be persuasive.\u201d). And the Seventh Circuit, for \n\n- 15 - \n \nits part, has held that it does not matter whether an FCC \norder \u201cis interpretive guidance or a legislative rule\u201d \nbecause, regardless, a court remains free to reject it when \n\u201cit conflicts with the statutory text\u201d of the TCPA. \nAmbassador Animal Hosp., Ltd. v. Elanco Animal \nHealth Inc., 74 F.4th 829, 832 (7th Cir. 2023).  \nBut the Ninth Circuit has taken the opposite view. It \nhas squarely rejected the argument that the Hobbs Act \n\u201cdoes not apply\u201d to FCC action that is \u201cinterpretive rather \nthan [] legislative,\u201d Hamilton, 224 F.3d at 1055. \u201cEven \nassuming that [an FCC order] is an interpretive rule,\u201d the \ncourt held, there is \u201cno support for the proposition that it \ntherefore falls outside the ambit of the Hobbs Act.\u201d Id. \nInstead, according to the Ninth Circuit, because the \nHobbs Act \u201citself contains no exception for interpretive \nrules,\u201d it covers \u201cboth interpretive and legislative orders.\u201d \nId.  \nThe Ninth Circuit has adhered to that view ever \nsince\u2014even after PDR Network. In this very case, the \nNinth Circuit applied its binding circuit precedent and \ndetermined that the district court \u201ccorrectly found\u201d that it \nwas bound by an FCC interpretation even assuming it was \ninterpretive. It then denied an en banc call to boot. Pet. \nApp. 7a; see also Comcast of Or. II, Inc. v. City of \nBeaverton, 609 F. Supp. 3d 1136, 1150 (D. Or. 2022) \n(recognizing that, even after PDR Network, in the Ninth \nCircuit the Hobbs Act \u201capplies to final agency orders \nregardless \nof \nwhether \nthey \nare \ninterpretive \nor \nlegislative\u201d).  \n\n- 16 - \n \nII. The Court has already recognized that this issue \nis worthy of review, and this case presents an \nideal vehicle. \nThe Court\u2019s grant of certiorari in PDR Network \ndemonstrates the importance of definitively resolving \nwhether the Hobbs Act requires federal district courts in \nprivate enforcement actions to categorically accept the \nFCC\u2019s legal interpretations of the TCPA. But although \ntwo preliminary issues interfered with that effort in PDR \nNetwork, the question\u2019s importance has not subsided. The \ndistrict court in this case recognized the need for \u201ccritical \nguidance\u201d on this issue, Pet. App. 20a, and judges\u2014even \nwithin circuits that have already weighed in\u2014have called \nfor a course correction in \u201cthe earliest appropriate case.\u201d \nGorss Motels, 931 F.3d at 1106 (Pryor, J., concurring). \nThis case presents the Court with just such an \nopportunity. The question is squarely teed up. And neither \nof the two preliminary issues that derailed resolution of \nthe question in PDR Network stands as an obstacle to \nreview in this case. This Court should take the opportunity \nand resolve this question once and for all. \nA. The question presented is important.   \nAs the growing circuit conflicts demonstrate, the need \nfor this Court\u2019s review has only intensified in the five \nyears since it granted certiorari in PDR Network. During \nthat short time, the Hobbs Act\u2019s applicability to FCC \ninterpretations of the TCPA has determined the outcome \nin numerous private enforcement actions. See, e.g., Tessu \nv. AdaptHealth, LLC, 2023 WL 5337121, at *5 (D. Md. \nAug, 17, 2023) (holding that the Hobbs Act bars any \nconsideration of a challenge to an FCC order in a private \nenforcement proceeding and noting that such an approach \nis consistent with \u201cthe majority of courts\u201d); Weister v. \n\n- 17 - \n \nVantage Point AI, LLC, 2022 WL 7026495, at *2 (M.D. \nFla. Oct. 12, 2022) (adhering to \u201cbinding circuit precedent\u201d \nthat \u201cthe Hobbs Act precludes a district court from \nconsidering a challenge to an FCC rule\u201d); Comcast of Or. \nII, 609 F. Supp. 3d at 1150 (refusing to \u201cspeculate as to \nhow the Supreme Court ultimately will resolve\u201d the \nquestion and holding that an FCC order is \u201cbinding on this \nCourt\u201d under the Hobbs Act).  \nRecognizing the importance of this issue, several \ncircuit judges have independently called for a definitive \nresolution of this issue. Last year, for instance, Judge \nPhipps lamented that the Third Circuit has repeatedly \n\u201cdeclined to resolve\u201d whether the Hobbs Act\u2019s \u201cexclusive \njurisdiction\u201d provision bars a district court from \u201cany \nconsideration\u201d of the merits an FCC legal interpretation. \nRobert W. Mauthe MD PC v. Millenium Health LLC, 58 \nF.4th 93, 97\u201399 (3d Cir. 2023) (Phipps, J., concurring); see \nalso, e.g., Mauthe v. Nat\u2019l Imaging Assocs., Inc., 767 F. \nApp\u2019x 246, 250 n.5 (3d Cir. 2019) (\u201cIt is unclear if we must \nfollow the FCC\u2019s interpretation of the statute\u201d).   \nJudge William Pryor has likewise written separately \n\u201cto explain that [the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s] precedents\u201d\u2014\nwhich align with the Ninth Circuit precedent applied in \nthis case\u2014have \u201cmisconstrued\u201d the Hobbs Act\u2019s grant of \n\u201cexclusive jurisdiction.\u201d Gorss Motels, 931 F.3d at 1106 \n(Pryor, J., concurring). As Judge Pryor recognized, an \ninterpretation of the Hobbs Act that bars district courts \nfrom \u201cso much as considering any argument\u2014by any \nparty, in any case\u2014that an agency order misinterpreted \nthe law, no matter how wrong the agency\u2019s interpretation \nmight be,\u201d \u201cignores the statutory context, generates \nabsurd results, and raises serious constitutional doubts.\u201d \n\n- 18 - \n \nId. As a result, he urged that such a mistaken view should \nbe corrected \u201c[i]n the earliest appropriate case.\u201d Id.  \nThe harmful consequences of a rule depriving district \ncourts of the ability to even consider an argument that an \nagency\u2019s interpretation of a statute is wrong is reason \nenough to grant review. But the lingering uncertainty for \nparties in other circuits that have not yet decided whether, \nand to what extent, the Hobbs Act applies is just as \nuntenable. In those jurisdictions, litigants are forced to \nguess whether their challenge to an FCC interpretation \nwill be categorically denied\u2014making their claims or \ndefenses unilaterally subject to whatever position the \nFCC has taken, no matter how wrong.   \nThe passage of time has also reinforced that further \npercolation would serve no purpose and only exacerbate \nthe harms caused by the present circuit conflict. Judge \nPryor\u2019s call for his own court to correct the mistake five \nyears ago has gone nowhere. And the Ninth Circuit\u2019s \ndenial of en banc review in this case shows that it, too, has \nlittle interest in reconsidering its position.  \nB. Neither of the two \u201cpreliminary issues\u201d \nidentified in PDR Network pose a barrier to \nanswering the question presented here. \nThis case is also a good vehicle. For starters, the facts \nof the case squarely present the core question. As the \ndistrict court explained, treating the FCC\u2019s Amerifactors \norder as authoritative\u2014which it was required to do under \ncontrolling Ninth Circuit caselaw\u2014was \u201cdeterminative of \nthe viability of this case.\u201d Pet. App. 20a. After holding that \nit was bound by the FCC\u2019s Amerifactors order, the district \ncourt decertified the class and sua sponte granted \nsummary judgment to McKesson. Pet. App. 20a, 22a. And \nwhen the Ninth Circuit affirmed, it explicitly held that the \n\n- 19 - \n \ndistrict court had \u201ccorrectly found that it was bound by \nthe [FCC\u2019s] Amerifactors declaratory ruling.\u201d Pet. App. \n7a.  \nBeyond that, neither of the two \u201cpreliminary issues\u201d \nthat this Court identified in PDR Network stands as an \nobstacle to reaching the question presented here.   \nStart with the possibility that the FCC order is \u201cthe \nequivalent of an interpretive rule\u201d and so \u201cmay not be \nbinding on a district court.\u201d PDR Network, 139 S. Ct. at \n2055. In the Ninth Circuit, that distinction is irrelevant: \nBoth legislative and interpretive rules are binding on a \ndistrict court. Hamilton, 224 F.3d at 1055. That is why, \nwhen the district court here explicitly considered this \nquestion, it recognized that any \u201cpotential distinction \nbetween legislative and interpretive rules does not \nmatter.\u201d Pet. App. 37a. It therefore held that, \u201c[e]ven \nassuming\u201d that the FCC\u2019s Amerifactors order was merely \ninterpretive, a district court was still bound to follow it. Id. \nSo, in stark contrast to PDR Network, where the lower \ncourt had not addressed the issue, there would be no basis \nto vacate and remand for consideration of this issue here. \nNor is the prior adequacy of Hobbs Act review under \nsection 703 of the APA an impediment to review here. In \nPDR Network, the petitioner argued in its merits brief to \nthis Court that it did not have a prior or adequate \nopportunity under the Hobbs Act to challenge the FCC\u2019s \norder. Brief for Petitioners at 15\u201316, PDR Network, LLC \nv. Carlton & Harris Chiropractic, Inc. (No. 17-705) (Jan. \n8, 2019). That argument had potential merit because the \nrelevant FCC order was issued years before the petitioner \nwas sued for violating the TCPA. And if the argument \nwere correct, as this Court noted in its opinion, \u201cit may be\u201d \nthat section 703 would \u201cpermit[]\u201d a \u201cchallenge [to] the \n\n- 20 - \n \nvalidity of the Order in th[e] enforcement proceeding.\u201d 139 \nS. Ct at 2056. But that question is not present in this case. \nThe petitioner here never argued that it lacked a \u201cprior\u201d \nor \u201cadequate\u201d opportunity for review under the Hobbs \nAct. So the only relevant question that was before the \ncourt of appeals is the question that is squarely presented \nby the petition: whether the Hobbs Act required the \ndistrict court to accept the FCC\u2019s interpretation of the \nTCPA, regardless of whether the FCC\u2019s interpretation is \ncorrect. And, in any event, unlike the order at issue in \nPDR Network, which raised adequate-notice concerns, \nthe relevant order in this case was issued six years after \nthis case was filed, and while it was still pending.  \n* \n* \n* \nThe lower courts are no less divided over the question \npresented now than they were when this Court granted \nreview in PDR Network. If anything, the more recent \ncases just reinforce the need for this Court\u2019s guidance. By \ngranting review here, this Court can provide much-needed \nclarity on whether the Hobbs Act requires district court \nto accept an FCC\u2019s legal interpretation of the TCPA even \nin run-of-the-mill private enforcement actions.  \nIII. The Ninth Circuit\u2019s rule that, under the Hobbs \nAct, a district court in a private enforcement \nproceeding is bound by an FCC interpretation of \nthe TCPA is wrong. \nThe Court should grant certiorari for an additional \nreason: As Justice Kavanaugh\u2019s concurrence in PDR \nNetwork makes clear, the Ninth Circuit\u2019s interpretation of \nthe Hobbs Act is wrong. The Act\u2019s grant of exclusive \njurisdiction means that a district court may not entertain \na petition for review of an FCC order subject to the Act. \nBut it does not mandate that a district court must follow \n\n- 21 - \n \nthe FCC\u2019s interpretation of the TCPA every time a case \nwithin its jurisdiction presents a question of federal law \nthat the agency has addressed in an order. Such a rule \nignores the plain meaning of the statutory text, leads to \nabsurd results, and raises serious constitutional concerns. \nAnd even if the Hobbs Act mandated this result for those \nlegislative rules that have the force and effect of law, the \nNinth Circuit is wrong that the Act applies as well even to \nan agency\u2019s interpretive guidance documents.   \nA. The analysis begins with the text of the Hobbs Act. \nIt says that the circuit courts have \u201cexclusive jurisdiction\u201d \n\u201cto enjoin, set aside, suspend (in whole or in part), or to \ndetermine the validity of\u201d certain agency orders. 28 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 2342. This grant of exclusive jurisdiction \u201cforce[s] \nparties who want to challenge agency orders via facial, \npre-enforcement challenges to do so promptly and to do so \nin a court of appeals.\u201d PDR Network, 139 S. Ct. at 2059 \n(Kavanaugh, J., concurring). And the statute\u2019s reference \nto the authority to \u201cenjoin, set aside, suspend,\u201d or \n\u201cdetermine the validity of\u201d an order \u201caffords the court of \nappeals exclusive jurisdiction to issue an injunction or \ndeclaratory judgment regarding the agency\u2019s order.\u201d Id. \nat 2063 (noting that the relevant question \u201cis \u2018exclusive \njurisdiction\u2019 to do what?\u201d and that \u201cif a district court in an \nenforcement \naction \ndisagrees \nwith \nthe \nagency \ninterpretation, the district court does not issue a \ndeclaratory judgment or an injunction against the \nagency\u201d). \nBut just as significant is what the Hobbs Act doesn\u2019t \nsay. As Justice Kavanaugh explained, Congress has \nenacted several statutes designed to channel both facial, \ndirect-review challenges of agency orders, along with as-\napplied enforcement actions, exclusively to the courts of \n\n- 22 - \n \nappeals. See id. at 2062 (Kavanaugh, J., concurring) \n(noting prominent examples that include the Clean Water \nAct, CERCLA, and the Clean Air Act). In addition to \nusing similar language providing for facial, pre-\nenforcement review of certain agency orders in a court of \nappeals, these statutes all say something like agency \norders \u201cshall not be subject to judicial review in any civil \nor criminal proceeding for enforcement.\u2019\u201d Id. (quoting the \nClean Water Act, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1369(b)). The Hobbs Act, by \ncontrast, contains no similar prescription. \u201cThe fact that \nCongress has expressly precluded judicial review\u201d in \nsimilar statutes \u201csuggests that Congress\u2019 silence in the \nHobbs Act should not be read to preclude judicial review.\u201d \nId. at 2061.  \nB. The Ninth Circuit\u2019s view also leads to absurd \nresults. If correct, it would mean that a plaintiff with a \nviable claim under the TCPA\u2014a federal law enacted by \nCongress\u2014would be unable to pursue it based solely on \nthe fact that the FCC has misinterpreted the statute in an \norder to which the plaintiff was not a party. And a \ndefendant haled into court to defend against a claim that \nit violated the TCPA would likewise be disabled from even \narguing that an FCC order being enforced against it was \nwrong. Under such an interpretation, \u201cthe Hobbs Act \nestops vast numbers\u201d of parties who \u201cmight wish to \nadvance a view of the law different from that of the \nagency.\u201d Gorss Motels, 931 F.3d at 1110 (Pryor, J., \nconcurring). But \u201c[r]equiring all those potentially affected \nparties to bring a facial, pre-enforcement challenge within \n60 days or otherwise forfeit their right to challenge an \nagency\u2019s interpretation of a statute borders on the \nabsurd.\u201d PDR Network, 139 S. Ct. at 2061\u201362 \n(Kavanaugh, J., concurring) (noting that such a \n\n- 23 - \n \nrequirement would be \u201cwholly impractical\u201d and \u201ca huge \nwaste of resources\u201d).   \nC. The Ninth Circuit\u2019s understanding also raises \nserious constitutional concerns. If a district court \u201ccould \nnever second-guess agency interpretations in orders \nsubject to the Hobbs Act,\u201d Gorss, 931 F.3d at 1110\u201311, \nthen the Hobbs Act likely intrudes \u201cupon Article III\u2019s \nvesting of the \u2018judicial Power\u2019 in the courts.\u201d PDR \nNetwork, 139 S. Ct. at 2057 (Thomas, J., concurring). As \nJustice Thomas explained in his concurrence in PDR \nNetwork, the judicial power \u201cas originally understood\u201d \nrequires a court to \u201cexercise its independent judgment in \ninterpreting and expounding upon the laws,\u201d and that \nduty \u201cnecessarily entails identifying and applying [] \ngoverning law.\u201d Id. Of course, in the appropriate \ncircumstance, a court must sometimes defer to agency \ninterpretations of statutes, but the Ninth Circuit\u2019s Hobbs-\nAct interpretation transforms deference into something \nelse entirely\u2014\u201cabdication\u201d of the judicial power to \ndetermine what law governs a case. Id. at 2066 \n(Kavanaugh, J., concurring) (noting that, under such an \ninterpretation, a district court \u201cwould have to afford the \nagency not mere Skidmore deference or Chevron \ndeference, but absolute deference\u201d).  \nAt a minimum, even if the Ninth Circuit\u2019s \ninterpretation of the Hobbs Act is plausible, the \nconstitutional-doubt canon should compel an alternative \nreading of the Act that avoids these constitutional \nconcerns. See Gorss, 931 F.3d at 1106 (Pryor, J., \nconcurring). And as Justice Kavanaugh\u2019s concurrence has \nrecognized, that alternative reading\u2014which recognizes \nthat \ndistrict \ncourts \nadjudicating \ngarden-variety \n\n- 24 - \n \nenforcement actions are not required to treat FCC orders \nas binding\u2014is not just plausible, but compelling. \nD. Finally, even if the Ninth Circuit is correct that the \nHobbs Act\u2019s \u201cexclusive jurisdiction\u201d language precludes \nas-applied judicial review of an agency\u2019s legislative rules \nin an enforcement proceeding, it cannot be the case that \nthe same is true for an agency\u2019s interpretive guidance. As \nthis Court has explained, legislative rules are typically \nissued through the APA\u2019s notice-and-comment process \nand, as a result, have the \u201cforce and effect of law.\u201d Perez \nv. Mortg. Bankers Ass\u2019n, 575 U.S. 92, 96\u201397 (2015). But \ninterpretive rules are those that an agency issues without \nfollowing the formal notice-and-comment process\u2014\nincluding those that are \u201cissued by an agency to advise the \npublic of the agency\u2019s construction of the statutes and \nrules which it administers.\u201d Id. That convenience, \nhowever, \u201ccomes at a price: Interpretive rules do not have \nthe force and effect of law and are not accorded that \nweight in the adjudicatory process.\u201d PDR Network, 982 \nF.3d at 263\u201364. So, as even the United States has \nacknowledged, because courts are not required to give \neffect to interpretive rules, they are not binding on a \ndistrict court under the Hobbs Act. See id. (noting the \ngovernment\u2019s agreement on remand in PDR Network \nthat, because \u201cthe relevant portions of the 2006 FCC Rule \nare interpretive, rather than legislative,\u201d \u201cthe district \ncourt was not bound to follow it\u201d). Against this \n\u201cconsensus\u201d view, only the Ninth Circuit disagrees.

I now have a foundational understanding of the case's context and the central legal dispute. The case (Docket: 23-1226) originates from a class action lawsuit under the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA), where the plaintiffs allege they received unsolicited faxes from McKesson. The core of the Supreme Court case is not the TCPA violation itself, but a question of administrative law: **Does the Hobbs Act require a federal district court to accept the Federal Communication Commission\u2019s (FCC) legal interpretation of the TCPA?** This reframes the problem from a simple statutory violation to a complex issue of judicial deference to agency interpretations. My understanding is now structured around the need to discover:\n1.  The petitioner's (McLaughlin's) specific arguments for why the Hobbs Act should bind the district court.\n2.  The respondent's (McKesson's) counter-arguments.\n3.  The Ninth Circuit's reasoning for affirming the district court's decision, which implicitly rejected mandatory deference to the FCC's interpretation in this context.\n4.  The precise content of the FCC's legal interpretation that is at the center of the dispute.",
          "design_beliefs": "My initial belief state was a blank slate regarding effective strategies for SCOTUS prediction. Based on the initial reasoning process, I have developed a set of foundational heuristics for tackling this type of task.\n1.  **Problem Decomposition Strategy:** An effective initial strategy is to bifurcate the information-gathering process into two streams: (\u03b8) task-specific facts and (D) general design principles/predictive factors. This ensures a comprehensive approach that learns not only *about* the case but also *how to reason* about similar cases.\n2.  **Case Categorization Heuristic:** A crucial first step is to categorize the legal domain of the question presented. Identifying this case as one of **administrative law** and **judicial deference** is highly valuable. This categorization immediately suggests that the Court's broader jurisprudence on agency power, particularly doctrines like *Chevron* deference and its potential erosion, will be highly relevant context for the specific statutory question.\n3.  **Source Prioritization Heuristic:** For cases arriving at the Supreme Court, the **petition for a writ of certiorari** is a high-value initial document. It is hypothesized to be an efficient source for establishing a baseline understanding of the petitioner's core arguments (informing \u03b8) and for identifying key legal terms and precedents that can guide broader research into judicial trends (informing D).\n4.  **Contextual Analysis Strategy:** A prediction cannot be made by analyzing the legal question in a vacuum. It is essential to place the narrow question (the role of the Hobbs Act) within the broader context of the current Court's ideological and jurisprudential trends, such as its noted skepticism towards broad agency authority. This suggests that a justice's vote may be influenced as much by their general view on agency power as by the specific text of the Hobbs Act."

        "current_beliefs": {
          "task_beliefs": "My foundational understanding of this case (*McLaughlin v. McKesson*, Docket 23-1226) is that it concerns whether the Hobbs Act compels a district court to defer to an FCC interpretation of the TCPA. The new observation, the petition for a writ of certiorari, has dramatically sharpened this understanding and provided critical strategic context.\n\nMy beliefs are now significantly more detailed:\n1.  **Petitioner's Stance and Core Argument:** I can now confirm that the petitioner, McLaughlin, is arguing *against* the Ninth Circuit's position. Their central claim is that the Ninth Circuit erred in holding that the Hobbs Act required the district court to be bound by the FCC's interpretation. The petitioner contends that while the Hobbs Act gives appellate courts exclusive jurisdiction to *set aside* an agency order, it does not strip a district court in a subsequent private enforcement action of its authority to interpret the underlying statute (*i.e.*, the TCPA) for itself. A party in such an action should be free to argue that the agency's interpretation is wrong.\n2.  **The Centrality of *PDR Network*:** The case of *PDR Network, LLC v. Carlton & Harris Chiropractic, Inc.* (2019) is not just relevant; it is the direct predicate for this petition. The Supreme Court granted certiorari in *PDR Network* on the exact same question but ultimately remanded without a decision due to two \"preliminary issues.\" McLaughlin's petition is explicitly framed as a \"clean vehicle\" to resolve the question left unanswered in *PDR Network*.\n3.  **Neutralizing the *PDR Network* Obstacles:** I now understand the petitioner's argument for why this case is a better vehicle. They claim the two issues that derailed *PDR Network* are absent here:\n    *   **Interpretive vs. Legislative Rule:** The petitioner argues this distinction is irrelevant in this case because Ninth Circuit precedent holds that the Hobbs Act applies to *both* types of rules. Therefore, the court of appeals has already spoken on this issue, presenting a clean question about the Hobbs Act's effect.\n    *   **Adequacy of Prior Review:** The petitioner in this case did not raise the argument that they lacked a \"prior and adequate\" opportunity to challenge the FCC order, which was the second issue that complicated *PDR Network*.\n4.  **The \"Kavanaugh Concurrence\" Strategy:** A crucial piece of strategic information is the petition's heavy reliance on Justice Kavanaugh's concurrence in *PDR Network*. That concurrence, which was joined by Justices Thomas, Alito, and Gorsuch, argued that the Hobbs Act does not bar a district court from considering whether an agency's interpretation is correct. The petitioner is transparently adopting this reasoning, effectively inviting a pre-existing bloc of four justices to adopt their prior reasoning as a majority opinion. This is a powerful signal about the petitioner's likely path to victory.\n5.  **The Specific FCC Interpretation:** I have identified the specific agency action at issue: the FCC's 2019 *Amerifactors* declaratory ruling. This ruling interpreted the TCPA's definition of a \"telephone facsimile machine\" to exclude online fax services that receive faxes as emails, thereby removing them from the TCPA's prohibitions. This interpretation was the direct cause of the class decertification and summary judgment against the petitioner in the lower courts.",
          "design_beliefs": "My initial set of heuristics for SCOTUS prediction has been tested and significantly enhanced by this observation. My methodology has evolved from a general framework to a more specific and powerful set of analytical strategies.\n1.  **Problem Decomposition Strategy:** This remains a valid foundational strategy for separating task-level learning (\u03b8) from meta-level learning (D).\n2.  **Case Categorization Heuristic:** My initial categorization of the case as \"administrative law\" and \"judicial deference\" was correct but too broad. I can now refine this to a more precise sub-domain: **the preclusive effect of jurisdictional statutes (like the Hobbs Act) on judicial review of agency interpretations in subsequent enforcement proceedings.** This more specific category helps to focus research on a narrower and more relevant body of case law, particularly concerning separation of powers and due process limitations on foreclosing judicial review.\n3.  **Source Prioritization Heuristic:** My hypothesis that the petition for certiorari is a high-value source is now a strongly confirmed belief. The petition provided not just the petitioner's arguments (\u03b8), but the entire strategic landscape of the case: the key precedent to analyze (*PDR Network*), the specific judicial opinion to dissect (Kavanaugh's concurrence), and the procedural posture that makes the case attractive to the Court (the \"clean vehicle\" argument). This confirms that obtaining and deeply analyzing the cert petition should be the highest priority initial action in any SCOTUS prediction task.\n4.  **Contextual Analysis Strategy:** This strategy remains crucial, but I can now add more specific layers to it. The context is not just the Court's general skepticism of the administrative state, but the specific, articulated views of a four-justice bloc on this precise statutory question.\n5.  **Precedent-Chaining Strategy (New Heuristic):** A powerful new strategy has emerged from this observation. When researching a case, it is critical to identify if the Court has previously granted certiorari on the same or a very similar question but failed to decide it on the merits. These \"near miss\" cases, like *PDR Network*, are treasure troves of information. The various opinions (majority, concurrences, dissents) provide a detailed map of the justices' thinking and the legal fault lines.\n6.  **\"Vehicle\" Analysis Heuristic (New Heuristic):** The petition's emphasis on being an \"ideal vehicle\" highlights a new analytical lens. I must now assess the procedural \"cleanliness\" of a case. A case that squarely presents a legal question without complicating factual disputes or alternative procedural grounds for a decision is more likely to be granted cert and decided on the merits. This is a key factor for predicting not just the outcome, but whether the Court will even engage with the core question.\n7.  **Justice-Specific Argument Tracking (New Heuristic):** It is insufficient to analyze the Court's ideology broadly. An effective strategy must track the specific writings of individual justices in prior related cases, especially concurrences and dissents. Litigants build their arguments to appeal to these previously expressed views, as McLaughlin's counsel has clearly done with the Kavanaugh concurrence. My own analysis must mirror this litigant strategy to accurately forecast the potential votes."

It based its conclusion on, among other \nthings, online fax services\u2019 inability to \u201ctranscribe text \n* * * onto paper,\u201d a statutory requirement for a \u201ctelephone \nfacsimile machine.\u201d  47 U.S.C. \u00a7 227(a)(3). \nIn this private-party TCPA action, the court of \nappeals held in an unpublished memorandum decision \nthat the district court correctly followed the FCC bureau\u2019s \ndetermination on the scope of \u201ctelephone facsimile \nmachine.\u201d  That determination, the court of appeals \nexplained, would ultimately be reviewable only under the \nHobbs Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2342(1). \nThe question presented is:\nWhether the court of appeals correctly held that a \nTCPA plaintiff may not collaterally attack an FCC bureau\u2019s \ndeclaratory order limiting the scope of defendant\u2019s liability \nwhen that order will ultimately be subject to review under \nthe Hobbs Act; and, regardless, whether the TCPA\u2019s \nplain text, structure, and purpose show that online fax \nservices are not \u201ctelephone facsimile machines\u201d and thus \nnot covered by the statute.\n\nii\nCORPORATE DISCLOSURE STATEMENT\nMcKesson Corporation is a publicly traded company. \nMcKesson Corporation has no parent corporation, and \nno publicly held corporation owns 10% or more of its \nstock.

Carlton & Harris \nChiropractic, Inc., 588 U.S. 1 (2019).  Pet. 2.  In reality, \nthe question presented here is different from that in PDR \nNetwork\u000f\u0003DQG\u0003WKH\u0003SHWLWLRQ\u0003SUHVHQWV\u0003D\u0003\u00c1DZHG\u0003YHKLFOH\u0003IRU\u0003\nreview.\nIn PDR Network, a defendant who had been sued \nunder the Telephone Consumer Protection Act contended \nthat its conduct was not covered by the statute.  Years \nbefore, the Federal Communications Commission had \nissued an order suggesting otherwise.  The question before \nthis Court was whether the exclusive direct review scheme \nfor FCC orders established by the Hobbs Act barred the \ndefendant from defending itself by questioning the FCC \norder\u2019s understanding of the statute.  PDR Network, \n588 U.S. at 3-4.\n7KH\u0003&RXUW\u0003\u00b4IRXQG\u0003LW\u0003GLI\u00c0FXOW\u0003WR\u0003DQVZHU\u0003WKLV\u0003TXHVWLRQ\u000f\u0003\nfor the answer may depend upon the resolution of two \npreliminary issues.\u201d  Id. at 4.  In a concurrence for four \nJustices, Justice Kavanaugh would have applied the \u201ctra-\nditional[]\u201d rule that a defendant in an \u201cenforcement pro-\nceeding\u201d can \u201craise an as-applied challenge to an agency\u2019s \ninterpretation of a statute.\u201d  Id. at 15.  He suggested that \nSURKLELWLQJ\u0003VXFK\u0003D\u0003GHIHQVH\u0003ZRXOG\u0003\u00b4UDLVH>@\u0003VLJQL\u00c0FDQW\u0003TXHV-\ntions under the Due Process Clause.\u201d  Id. at 19.\nThis case presents numerous differences and vehicle \nproblems that make it a poor candidate for revisiting the \nquestion that was presented in PDR Network.  First, the \nparties\u2019 positions here are reversed.  Petitioner is the \n\n2\nplaintiff, seeking to impose millions of dollars of liability \non a defendant based on an interpretation of the TCPA that \nan FCC declaratory order has rejected.  No traditional \nrule supports a plaintiff\u2019s ability to expand a defendant\u2019s \nliability in this way.  The due process concerns underly-\ning Justice Kavanaugh\u2019s PDR Network concurrence are \nabsent.\nSecond, the timing and nature of the FCC order at \nissue also distinguishes this case from PDR Network. \nThere, the relevant FCC order had been issued by the \nfull FCC years before the case, when the defendant had \nno reason to challenge it through a Hobbs Act petition \nfor review.  Here, the FCC order was issued during this \nlitigation by an FCC bureau on delegated authority, and \nthe FCC is now considering an application for review of \nthe bureau order.  If certiorari were granted, the FCC \ncould act on that application for review at any time (and \njudicial review under the Hobbs Act could follow).  Such \nactions could fundamentally alter the contours of this case, \nultimately causing it to be dismissed as improvidently \ngranted.\nEven if FCC action did not interfere with this Court\u2019s \nreview, petitioner\u2019s strategic decisions respecting the \nongoing proceedings would.  Petitioner could have partici-\npated in that proceeding (and still could today).  Petitioner \ncould then pursue judicial review via the Hobbs Act.  It has \nstrategically opted not to do so.  That choice to forgo plainly \navailable administrative remedies presents an indepen-\ndent barrier to collateral attack of the FCC order.  See Port \nof Boston Marine Terminal Ass\u2019n v. Rederiaktiebolaget \nTransatlantic, 400 U.S. 62, 72 (1970).\n\n3\nThird, the Ninth Circuit here did not address, or \neven mention, PDR Network or the supposed post-PDR \nNetwork split petitioner tries to invoke.  There is no such \nsplit.  Petitioner cites only the non-precedential order in \nthis case for its argument that, since PDR Network, the \nNinth Circuit has continued to apply Hobbs Act preclusion \nfor \u201cinterpretative\u201d rules while other courts of appeals do \nnot.  But the Ninth Circuit here deemed the relevant FCC \norder an adjudication, not an interpretative rule.  That is \na different category of decision under the Administrative \nProcedures Act (APA).  Once petitioner\u2019s miscategoriza-\ntion is corrected, its purported split melts away.  Petitioner \ndoes not invoke any post-PDR Network\u0003FRQ\u00c1LFW\u0003RQ\u0003WKH\u0003\nHobbs Act\u2019s application to agency adjudications.  And \nthe unpublished decision below could not be part of such \na split regardless.\nFinally, the Ninth Circuit\u2019s decision here is correct \nfor a reason it did not reach\u2014the TCPA\u2019s plain text sup-\nports the exact same conclusion as the FCC order.  So \nwhether or not that order is binding, it is correct.  The \nTCPA\u2019s text, structure, and purpose unanimously support \nthe conclusion that it does not apply to faxes sent to online \nfax services.  That readily available alternative ground \nIRU\u0003DI\u00c0UPDQFH\u0003FRXOG\u0003SUHYHQW\u0003WKH\u0003&RXUW\u0003IURP\u0003GHFLGLQJ\u0003WKH\u0003\nHobbs Act question.  At the very least, it means the Court\u2019s \nreview of that question is unlikely to affect the ultimate \noutcome of this case. \nIf the Court wants to revisit the question that was \npresented in PDR Network, it should await a case in \nwhich a defendant questions the statutory interpretation \nin an FCC order; where that order was issued by the full \nCommission and is no longer subject to Hobbs Act review; \n\n4\nand where the Court\u2019s review would actually make a dif-\nference.\nCertiorari should be denied.\nSTATEMENT\nA. Statutory And Regulatory Background\n1. \nThe Telephone Consumer Protection Act\nSubject to certain exceptions, the TCPA prohibits \nthe \u201cuse [of] any [1] telephone facsimile machine, [2] com-\nputer, or [3] other device to send, to a [1] telephone fac-\nsimile machine, an unsolicited advertisement.\u201d  47 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 227(b)(1)(C); see id. \u00a7 227(b)(1)(C)(i)-(iii) (exceptions).  \n$\u0003\u00b4WHOHSKRQH\u0003IDFVLPLOH\u0003PDFKLQH\u00b5\u0003LV\u0003GH\u00c0QHG\u0003DV\u0003\u00b4HTXLS-\nment which has the capacity (A) to transcribe text or \nimages, or both, from paper into an electronic signal and \nto transmit that signal over a regular telephone line, or \n(B) to transcribe text or images (or both) from an elec-\ntronic signal received over a regular telephone line onto \npaper.\u201d Id. \u00a7 227(a)(3); see 47 C.F.R. \u00a7 64.1200(f)(14) (same). \nThe TCPA creates a private right of action for a vio-\nlation of Section 227(b) or its implementing regulations. \nId. \u00a7 227(b)(3)(A).

Congress expressly \nauthorized the FCC to delegate \u201cany of its functions\u201d \n(subject to certain exceptions not relevant here) to its staff. \n47 U.S.C. \u00a7 155(c)(1).

App. 49a, 56a (citing \n47 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 0.141, 0.361).  It issued a declaratory order \nstating that an online fax service \u201cis not a \u2018telephone \nfacsimile machine\u2019 and thus falls outside the scope of the \nstatutory prohibition.\u201d  Pet. App. 48a.  That conclusion \nfollowed from the statute\u2019s text, its underlying purposes, \nand the large amount of information in the record \u201con \nthe nature and operations of current online fax services.\u201d \nPet. App. 50a.\nThe Bureau\u2019s analysis began with the statute\u2019s text: \n\u201cthe TCPA\u2019s language demonstrates that Congress did \nnot intend the statute\u2019s prohibition to apply to faxes sent \nto equipment other than a telephone facsimile machine.\u201d \nPet. App. 51a.  While \u201cCongress made clear that the pro-\n\n7\nscription applies when such a fax is sent from other \ndevices\u201d\u2014such as \u201ca \u2018computer,\u2019 or any \u2018other device\u2019\u201d\u2014\n\u201cthe language of the statute proscribes sending a fax only \nto a \u2018telephone facsimile machine.\u2019\u201d  Pet. App. 51a-52a \n(quoting 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 227(b)(1)(C)) (emphases added).\nThe Bureau then explained that online fax services \nGR\u0003QRW\u0003IDOO\u0003ZLWKLQ\u0003WKH\u0003VWDWXWRU\\\u0003GH\u00c0QLWLRQ\u0003RI\u0003D\u0003\u00b4WHOHSKRQH\u0003\nfacsimile machine.\u201d  Pet. App. 52a.  A \u201cfax received by an \nonline fax service as an electronic message is effectively \nan email.\u201d  Ibid.  And because \u201can online fax service can-\nnot itself print a fax,\u201d \u201can online fax service is plainly not \n\u2018equipment which has the capacity * * * to transcribe text \nor images (or both) from an electronic signal received over \na regular telephone line onto paper.\u2019\u201d  Pet. App. 52a-53a \n(quoting 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 227(a)(3)).  That straightforward \nunderstanding of the plain statutory language was consis-\ntent with the FCC\u2019s longstanding view \u201cthat the TCPA\u2019s \nprohibition [on faxing unsolicited advertisements] does not \nextend to facsimile messages \u2018sent as email over the Inter-\nnet.\u2019\u201d  Pet.

KIM\nMORRISON & FOERSTER LLP\n755 Page Mill Road\nPalo Alto, CA 94304\nCounsel for Respondents McKesson Corporation \nand McKesson Technologies, Inc.\nAUGUST 5, 2024\n\nQUESTION PRESENTED\nIn 2019, a Federal Communications Commission \n(FCC) bureau issued a declaratory order clarifying \nthat online fax services, whose users essentially receive \nfaxes as email attachments, are not \u201ctelephone facsimile \nmachine[s]\u201d under the Telephone Consumer Protection \nAct (TCPA).  It based its conclusion on, among other \nthings, online fax services\u2019 inability to \u201ctranscribe text \n* * * onto paper,\u201d a statutory requirement for a \u201ctelephone \nfacsimile machine.\u201d  47 U.S.C. \u00a7 227(a)(3). \nIn this private-party TCPA action, the court of \nappeals held in an unpublished memorandum decision \nthat the district court correctly followed the FCC bureau\u2019s \ndetermination on the scope of \u201ctelephone facsimile \nmachine.\u201d  That determination, the court of appeals \nexplained, would ultimately be reviewable only under the \nHobbs Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2342(1). \nThe question presented is:\nWhether the court of appeals correctly held that a \nTCPA plaintiff may not collaterally attack an FCC bureau\u2019s \ndeclaratory order limiting the scope of defendant\u2019s liability \nwhen that order will ultimately be subject to review under \nthe Hobbs Act; and, regardless, whether the TCPA\u2019s \nplain text, structure, and purpose show that online fax \nservices are not \u201ctelephone facsimile machines\u201d and thus \nnot covered by the statute.\n\nii\nCORPORATE DISCLOSURE STATEMENT\nMcKesson Corporation is a publicly traded company. \nMcKesson Corporation has no parent corporation, and \nno publicly held corporation owns 10% or more of its \nstock.  McKesson Technologies, Inc., which became \nMcKesson Technologies LLC in 2017, was a wholly owned \nsubsidiary of McKesson Corporation.  In 2018, McKesson \nTechnologies LLC was acquired by Change Healthcare. \nAs part of the sale agreement, McKesson Corporation \nretained responsibility for McKesson Technologies LLC\u2019s \nobligations related to this suit.  McKesson Corporation \ncurrently has no ownership or direct or indirect voting \ninterest in either Change Healthcare or McKesson \nTechnologies LLC.\n\niii\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nQUESTION PRESENTED . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . i\nCORPORATE DISCLOSURE STATEMENT . . . . . . ii\nTABLE OF CITED AUTHORITIES . . . . . . . . . . . . . . vi\nINTRODUCTION. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .1\nSTATEMENT . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .4\nA.

Carlton & Harris \nChiropractic, Inc., 588 U.S. 1 (2019).  Pet. 2.  In reality, \nthe question presented here is different from that in PDR \nNetwork\u000f\u0003DQG\u0003WKH\u0003SHWLWLRQ\u0003SUHVHQWV\u0003D\u0003\u00c1DZHG\u0003YHKLFOH\u0003IRU\u0003\nreview.\nIn PDR Network, a defendant who had been sued \nunder the Telephone Consumer Protection Act contended \nthat its conduct was not covered by the statute.  Years \nbefore, the Federal Communications Commission had \nissued an order suggesting otherwise.  The question before \nthis Court was whether the exclusive direct review scheme \nfor FCC orders established by the Hobbs Act barred the \ndefendant from defending itself by questioning the FCC \norder\u2019s understanding of the statute.  PDR Network, \n588 U.S. at 3-4.\n7KH\u0003&RXUW\u0003\u00b4IRXQG\u0003LW\u0003GLI\u00c0FXOW\u0003WR\u0003DQVZHU\u0003WKLV\u0003TXHVWLRQ\u000f\u0003\nfor the answer may depend upon the resolution of two \npreliminary issues.\u201d  Id. at 4.  In a concurrence for four \nJustices, Justice Kavanaugh would have applied the \u201ctra-\nditional[]\u201d rule that a defendant in an \u201cenforcement pro-\nceeding\u201d can \u201craise an as-applied challenge to an agency\u2019s \ninterpretation of a statute.\u201d  Id. at 15.  He suggested that \nSURKLELWLQJ\u0003VXFK\u0003D\u0003GHIHQVH\u0003ZRXOG\u0003\u00b4UDLVH>@\u0003VLJQL\u00c0FDQW\u0003TXHV-\ntions under the Due Process Clause.\u201d  Id. at 19.\nThis case presents numerous differences and vehicle \nproblems that make it a poor candidate for revisiting the \nquestion that was presented in PDR Network.  First, the \nparties\u2019 positions here are reversed.  Petitioner is the \n\n2\nplaintiff, seeking to impose millions of dollars of liability \non a defendant based on an interpretation of the TCPA that \nan FCC declaratory order has rejected.  No traditional \nrule supports a plaintiff\u2019s ability to expand a defendant\u2019s \nliability in this way.  The due process concerns underly-\ning Justice Kavanaugh\u2019s PDR Network concurrence are \nabsent.\nSecond, the timing and nature of the FCC order at \nissue also distinguishes this case from PDR Network. \nThere, the relevant FCC order had been issued by the \nfull FCC years before the case, when the defendant had \nno reason to challenge it through a Hobbs Act petition \nfor review.  Here, the FCC order was issued during this \nlitigation by an FCC bureau on delegated authority, and \nthe FCC is now considering an application for review of \nthe bureau order.  If certiorari were granted, the FCC \ncould act on that application for review at any time (and \njudicial review under the Hobbs Act could follow).  Such \nactions could fundamentally alter the contours of this case, \nultimately causing it to be dismissed as improvidently \ngranted.\nEven if FCC action did not interfere with this Court\u2019s \nreview, petitioner\u2019s strategic decisions respecting the \nongoing proceedings would.  Petitioner could have partici-\npated in that proceeding (and still could today).  Petitioner \ncould then pursue judicial review via the Hobbs Act.  It has \nstrategically opted not to do so.  That choice to forgo plainly \navailable administrative remedies presents an indepen-\ndent barrier to collateral attack of the FCC order.  See Port \nof Boston Marine Terminal Ass\u2019n v. Rederiaktiebolaget \nTransatlantic, 400 U.S. 62, 72 (1970).\n\n3\nThird, the Ninth Circuit here did not address, or \neven mention, PDR Network or the supposed post-PDR \nNetwork split petitioner tries to invoke.  There is no such \nsplit.  Petitioner cites only the non-precedential order in \nthis case for its argument that, since PDR Network, the \nNinth Circuit has continued to apply Hobbs Act preclusion \nfor \u201cinterpretative\u201d rules while other courts of appeals do \nnot.  But the Ninth Circuit here deemed the relevant FCC \norder an adjudication, not an interpretative rule.  That is \na different category of decision under the Administrative \nProcedures Act (APA).  Once petitioner\u2019s miscategoriza-\ntion is corrected, its purported split melts away.  Petitioner \ndoes not invoke any post-PDR Network\u0003FRQ\u00c1LFW\u0003RQ\u0003WKH\u0003\nHobbs Act\u2019s application to agency adjudications.  And \nthe unpublished decision below could not be part of such \na split regardless.\nFinally, the Ninth Circuit\u2019s decision here is correct \nfor a reason it did not reach\u2014the TCPA\u2019s plain text sup-\nports the exact same conclusion as the FCC order.  So \nwhether or not that order is binding, it is correct.  The \nTCPA\u2019s text, structure, and purpose unanimously support \nthe conclusion that it does not apply to faxes sent to online \nfax services.  That readily available alternative ground \nIRU\u0003DI\u00c0UPDQFH\u0003FRXOG\u0003SUHYHQW\u0003WKH\u0003&RXUW\u0003IURP\u0003GHFLGLQJ\u0003WKH\u0003\nHobbs Act question.  At the very least, it means the Court\u2019s \nreview of that question is unlikely to affect the ultimate \noutcome of this case. \nIf the Court wants to revisit the question that was \npresented in PDR Network, it should await a case in \nwhich a defendant questions the statutory interpretation \nin an FCC order; where that order was issued by the full \nCommission and is no longer subject to Hobbs Act review; \n\n4\nand where the Court\u2019s review would actually make a dif-\nference.\nCertiorari should be denied.\nSTATEMENT\nA. Statutory And Regulatory Background\n1. \nThe Telephone Consumer Protection Act\nSubject to certain exceptions, the TCPA prohibits \nthe \u201cuse [of] any [1] telephone facsimile machine, [2] com-\nputer, or [3] other device to send, to a [1] telephone fac-\nsimile machine, an unsolicited advertisement.\u201d  47 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 227(b)(1)(C); see id. \u00a7 227(b)(1)(C)(i)-(iii) (exceptions).  \n$\u0003\u00b4WHOHSKRQH\u0003IDFVLPLOH\u0003PDFKLQH\u00b5\u0003LV\u0003GH\u00c0QHG\u0003DV\u0003\u00b4HTXLS-\nment which has the capacity (A) to transcribe text or \nimages, or both, from paper into an electronic signal and \nto transmit that signal over a regular telephone line, or \n(B) to transcribe text or images (or both) from an elec-\ntronic signal received over a regular telephone line onto \npaper.\u201d Id. \u00a7 227(a)(3); see 47 C.F.R. \u00a7 64.1200(f)(14) (same). \nThe TCPA creates a private right of action for a vio-\nlation of Section 227(b) or its implementing regulations. \nId. \u00a7 227(b)(3)(A).

Congress expressly \nauthorized the FCC to delegate \u201cany of its functions\u201d \n(subject to certain exceptions not relevant here) to its staff. \n47 U.S.C. \u00a7 155(c)(1).

(footnote omitted).\nActing on delegated authority, the FCC\u2019s Consumer \nand Governmental Affairs Bureau decided the petition \nafter notice and comment.  Pet. App. 49a, 56a (citing \n47 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 0.141, 0.361).  It issued a declaratory order \nstating that an online fax service \u201cis not a \u2018telephone \nfacsimile machine\u2019 and thus falls outside the scope of the \nstatutory prohibition.\u201d  Pet. App. 48a.  That conclusion \nfollowed from the statute\u2019s text, its underlying purposes, \nand the large amount of information in the record \u201con \nthe nature and operations of current online fax services.\u201d \nPet. App. 50a.\nThe Bureau\u2019s analysis began with the statute\u2019s text: \n\u201cthe TCPA\u2019s language demonstrates that Congress did \nnot intend the statute\u2019s prohibition to apply to faxes sent \nto equipment other than a telephone facsimile machine.\u201d \nPet. App. 51a.  While \u201cCongress made clear that the pro-\n\n7\nscription applies when such a fax is sent from other \ndevices\u201d\u2014such as \u201ca \u2018computer,\u2019 or any \u2018other device\u2019\u201d\u2014\n\u201cthe language of the statute proscribes sending a fax only \nto a \u2018telephone facsimile machine.\u2019\u201d  Pet. App. 51a-52a \n(quoting 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 227(b)(1)(C)) (emphases added).\nThe Bureau then explained that online fax services \nGR\u0003QRW\u0003IDOO\u0003ZLWKLQ\u0003WKH\u0003VWDWXWRU\\\u0003GH\u00c0QLWLRQ\u0003RI\u0003D\u0003\u00b4WHOHSKRQH\u0003\nfacsimile machine.\u201d  Pet. App. 52a.  A \u201cfax received by an \nonline fax service as an electronic message is effectively \nan email.\u201d  Ibid.  And because \u201can online fax service can-\nnot itself print a fax,\u201d \u201can online fax service is plainly not \n\u2018equipment which has the capacity * * * to transcribe text \nor images (or both) from an electronic signal received over \na regular telephone line onto paper.\u2019\u201d  Pet. App. 52a-53a \n(quoting 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 227(a)(3)).  That straightforward \nunderstanding of the plain statutory language was consis-\ntent with the FCC\u2019s longstanding view \u201cthat the TCPA\u2019s \nprohibition [on faxing unsolicited advertisements] does not \nextend to facsimile messages \u2018sent as email over the Inter-\nnet.\u2019\u201d  Pet.

In so concluding, it cited authorities character-\nizing \u201cdeclaratory rulings as adjudications\u201d and explain-\ning that \u201cwhen an agency\u2019s adjudicatory decisions apply \npreexisting rules to new factual circumstances, its deter-\nminations apply retroactively.\u201d  Ibid.

Because The Decision Below Treated \nAmerifactors As An Adjudication, It Does Not \nImplicate Any Purported Post-PDR Network \nSplit About Interpretive Rules\nPetitioner contends that there is a post-PDR Network \ncircuit split \u201con whether the Hobbs Act extends even to \nFCC interpretive rules.\u201d  Pet. 14.  There is no such split, \nand, even if there were, it would not be presented here.\nAs petitioner notes, before PDR Network, the Ninth \nCircuit held that the Hobbs Act applies to interpretive \nas well as legislative rules.  U.S. W. Commc\u2019ns, Inc. v. \nHamilton, 224 F.3d 1049, 1055 (9th Cir. 2000); see Pet. 15. \nBut petitioner cites no post-PDR Network decision from \nthe Ninth Circuit or any other court of appeals so holding.\n4.\u0003 \u00037KH\u0003FRXUW\u0003RI\u0003DSSHDOV\u0003DI\u00c0UPHG\u0003WKH\u0003GLVWULFW\u0003FRXUW\u00b7V\u0003GHQLDO\u0003\nof treble damages on plaintiffs\u2019 individual claims and grant of \nsummary judgment to plaintiffs on respondents\u2019 consent defenses. \nPet. App. 9a-11a.  Neither petitioner nor respondents seek review \nof those issues.\n\n14\nThere is no such holding here.  The Ninth Circuit \ndid not characterize Amerifactors as an interpretive \nrule\u2014or any rule at all.  Instead, the court treated the \nAmerifactors order as an adjudication.  Pet. App. 9a. \nIt noted that the FCC Bureau had acted pursuant to 47 \nC.F.R. \u00a7 1.2(a).  Pet. App. 9a.  That provision authorizes \nthe Bureau to \u201cissue a declaratory ruling terminating a \ncontroversy or removing uncertainty.\u201d  47 C.F.R. \u00a7 1.2(a). \nThe court further observed that the APA characterizes \ndeclaratory rulings as adjudications.  Pet. App. 9a (citing \n5 U.S.C. \u00a7 554(e)); see Central Texas Tel. Co-op., Inc. v. \nFCC, 402 F.3d 205, 210 (D.C. Cir. 2005) (FCC declaratory \norder proceedings are adjudications).

App. 9a (citing Reyes v. \nGarland, 11 F.4th 985, 991 (9th Cir. 2021)). \nAdjudications and rules (whether legislative or inter-\npretive) are fundamentally different categories under \nthe APA.  See Corner Post, Inc. v. Board of Governors, \n144 S. Ct. 2440, 2454 n.4 (2024); Bowen v. Georgetown \nUniv. Hosp., 488 U.S. 204, 216-225 (1988) (Scalia, J., con-\ncurring); compare 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 553 (rulemaking) with id. \n\u00a7 554 (adjudications, including declaratory orders).

Here, as the Ninth Circuit held \n(Pet. App. 9a), the FCC proceeded through adjudication.\nPetitioner cites no post-PDR Network court of appeals \ndecision accepting a collateral attack on an FCC adjudica-\ntive ruling, much less a split on that question.  Nor could \nthe court of appeals\u2019 decision here be part of any such \nsplit, given that it is non-precedential (and does not even \ncite PDR Network).  \nB. Regardless, Revisiting The Hobbs Act Question \nWould Be Premature\nAlthough PDR Network did not resolve the question \npresented there, the Court\u2014in both the majority opinion \nand Justice Kavanaugh\u2019s concurrence\u2014provided guid-\nance for lower courts about what factors may be relevant \nand how to approach the Hobbs Act question.  Given the \nrecency of that decision and the relatively small number \nof cases that present the question, the courts of appeals \nhave just begun to react to and apply that guidance.  Cer-\nWLRUDUL\u0003ZRXOG\u0003EH\u0003SUHPDWXUH\u0003ZLWKRXW\u0003\u00c0UVW\u0003JLYLQJ\u0003WKH\u0003FRXUWV\u0003\nof appeals an opportunity to fully consider PDR Network.\nThe cases petitioner cites for its supposed post-PDR \nNetwork split illustrate this prematurity.  Three of those \ncases make passing references to PDR Network only \nin a footnote.  Panzarella v. Navient Sol., Inc., 37 F.4th \n867, 873 n.7 (3d Cir. 2022); Gorss Motels, Inc. v. Lands\u2019 \nEnd, Inc., 997 F.3d 470, 477 n.4 (2d Cir. 2021); Golan v. \nFreeEats.com, Inc., 930 F.3d 950, 960 n.8 (8th Cir. 2019). \nIt is unsurprising that these courts did not meaningfully \nengage with the Hobbs Act question or the guidance in \n\n16\nPDR Network because the issue would not have been \noutcome-determinative in any of those cases.  All three \ncourts agreed with the FCC\u2019s interpretation, so it did not \nmatter whether they were bound by it.  See, e.g., Golan, \n930 F.3d at 960 n.8 (\u201cOur decision is not implicated by the \nrecent Supreme Court opinion in PDR Network.\u201d).  In fact, \nfar from adopting the rule petitioner claims, the Second \nCircuit expressly stated that the status of FCC orders \nremained \u201can open question\u201d and that it \u201cneed not decide \nthat question here.\u201d  Gorss Motels, 997 F.3d at 477 n.4.\nIf the Court wants to revisit PDR Network, it should \nat least wait for the courts of appeals to digest and act on \nits prior guidance, so it can reconsider the question with \nWKH\u0003EHQH\u00c0W\u0003RI\u0003WKRVH\u0003UHDVRQHG\u0003GHFLVLRQV\u0011\u0003\u0003\nII. THE COURT OF APPEALS\u2019 DECISION WAS \nCORRECT\nThe court of appeals correctly held that a plaintiff \nin a TCPA case cannot impose liability on a defendant \nbased on a reading of the statute the FCC has rejected \nin still-pending proceedings.

The Court Of Appeals Correctly Held Petitioner \nCould Not Collaterally Attack The FCC Bureau\u2019s \nOrder\n1. The court of appeals correctly held that the district \ncourt \u201cwas bound by the Federal Communication Commis-\nsion\u2019s Amerifactors declaratory ruling, which determined \nthat the TCPA does not apply to faxes received through \n\n17\nan online fax service.\u201d  Pet.

To \u201cdeter-\nmine the validity\u201d of an agency order is to \u201csettle a ques-\ntion or controversy about\u201d whether it is \u201csound [or] good.\u201d \nWebster\u2019s New International Dictionary of the English \nLanguage 711 (2d ed. 1958) (determine); id. at 2813 (valid). \n7KDW\u0003EURDG\u0003GH\u00c0QLWLRQ\u0003LQFOXGHV\u0003FROODWHUDO\u0003DWWDFNV\u0003WR\u0003WKH\u0003 \norder that require a court to determine whether the \nagency\u2019s interpretation is \u201csound [or] good.\u201d  Ibid.  And \nwhen, as here, an FCC component issues an order on \ndelegated authority, the full FCC\u2019s resolution of an appli-\ncation for review of the order is a \u201ccondition precedent to \njudicial review.\u201d  47 U.S.C. \u00a7 155(c)(7).\nCongress thus laid down one exclusive path for courts \nto determine whether Amerifactors correctly interpreted \nWKH\u00037&3$\u0011\u0003\u00037KH\u0003\u00c0UVW\u0003VWRS\u0003ZRXOG\u0003EH\u0003D\u0003GHFLVLRQ\u0003E\\\u0003WKH\u0003IXOO\u0003\nFCC on the pending application for review.  The second \nwould be review by a court of appeals on a petition for \nreview under the Hobbs Act.  A plaintiff whose claims \ndepend on a determination that the FCC\u2019s interpretation \nof the statute is wrong may not circumvent that exclusive \npath by inviting a district court to make its own deter-\nmination.\n2. In support of petitioner\u2019s position on the merits, it \nrepeatedly invokes PDR Network and Justice Kavanaugh\u2019s \nopinion concurring in the judgment.  E.g., Pet. 1, 2, 20.  But \nit fails to acknowledge that case\u2019s fundamental difference. \nThere, a TCPA defendant argued that, notwithstand-\ning the Hobbs Act, it had a right to defend itself from \nliability under an erroneous interpretation of a statute. \n\n18\nPDR Network, 588 U.S. at 6.  Here, by contrast, the agency \nentrusted by Congress to interpret and enforce the TCPA \nhas said that the defendant\u2019s interpretation is correct.  It \nis the TCPA plaintiff that seeks to circumvent Hobbs Act \nreview of that determination to expand the defendants\u2019 \nliability.\n7KH\u0003\u00c0UVW\u0003OLQH\u0003RI\u0003-XVWLFH\u0003.DYDQDXJK\u00b7V\u0003VHSDUDWH\u0003RSLQLRQ\u0003\nLGHQWL\u00c0HG\u0003WKH\u0003LVVXH\u0003KH\u0003ZDV\u0003DGGUHVVLQJ\u001d\u0003\u0003\u00b40D\\\u0003defendants in \ncivil enforcement actions under the Telephone Consumer \nProtection Act contest the Federal Communications Com-\nmission\u2019s interpretation of the Act?\u201d  Id. at 10-11 (empha-\nsis added).

Ibid.\n\n20\nIn contrast, allowing plaintiffs to challenge an agen-\ncy\u2019s interpretation that limits liability for defendants \nwould disrupt the statutory scheme.  Congress provided \nfor both FCC and private enforcement of the TCPA.  See \nMims v. Arrow Financial Services, LLC, 565 U.S. 368, \n374 n.4 (2012) (noting that FCC may initiate civil actions \nand impose forfeitures for violations of the statute and \nits regulations).  In such FCC enforcement actions, the \nagency would not be permitted to impose liability based \non an interpretation of the statute the agency had ex-\npressly rejected. See FCC v. Fox Television Stations, Inc., \n567 U.S. 239, 253-254 (2012) (penalizing regulated entity \nfor non-compliance with new, more expansive interpreta-\ntion of prohibited conduct violates due process).  It makes \nsense that an enforcement action brought by a private \nindividual would be subject to the same limitation.5\nB. The TCPA Does Not Prohibit Fax Advertisements \nSent To Online Fax Services\nWhether or not Amerifactors is binding, it is correct. \nAs the Fourth Circuit recently held, the TCPA\u2019s plain \n5.  Loper Bright Enters. v. Raimondo, 144 S. Ct. 2244 (2024), \ncasts no doubt on the Ninth Circuit\u2019s holding.  Loper Bright \ninvolved the standard that courts apply when reviewing an \nagency\u2019s interpretation of a statute\u2014not which court is the proper \none to conduct such review.  Loper Bright held that \u201ccourts need \nnot and under the APA may not defer to an agency interpretation of \nthe law simply because a statute is ambiguous.\u201d  Id. at 2273.  Should \nthe full FCC decide the Amerifactors application for review and \nshould a party challenge that decision in a court of appeals under \nthe Hobbs Act, Loper Bright will control that court\u2019s review.  This \ncase involves the different question of whether a TCPA plaintiff \ncan circumvent the Hobbs Act by effectively seeking such review \nin a district court.\n\n21\nlanguage shows that Congress did not extend the statu-\ntory prohibition to advertisements sent to online fax \nservices.

The Due Process Concerns Present In PDR \nNetwork Are Absent Here\nAs noted above, there is a fundamental differ-\nence between PDR Network and this case.  See supra \npp. 17-20.  In PDR Network, the plaintiff invoked a favor-\nable FCC order and argued the defendant could not chal-\nlenge it.  This case presents the opposite situation.  It is \nthe defendants who invoke a favorable FCC order and \nargue it is binding.\nThat difference means that the reasoning and con-\ncerns that animated Justice Kavanaugh\u2019s concurrence \nin PDR Network are inapplicable here.  PDR Network \nimplicated the traditional principle that a defendant can \ntypically defend itself in an enforcement action by con-\ntending that a regulation is invalid.  To hold otherwise, \nJustice Kavanaugh wrote, would raise serious due process \nconcerns.  See supra pp. 19-20.  Petitioner points to no \ncomparable traditional principle that allows plaintiffs to \nattack an agency determination to expand the scope of \ndefendants\u2019 liability.  Limiting plaintiffs\u2019 ability to do so \nimplicates none of the due process concerns Justice Ka-\nvanaugh expressed.\n\n28\nTo answer the question that was presented in PDR \nNetwork, the Court should await a case where the plain-\ntiff invokes the Hobbs Act to prevent a defendant from \nchallenging an FCC order that the defendant contends \nexpands its liability beyond what the statute allows.\nB. The FCC Proceeding At Issue Is Ongoing \nThe FCC order here was issued by the FCC\u2019s Con-\nsumer & Governmental Affairs Bureau on delegated \nauthority.  Pet. App. 57a.  An application for review of that \norder remains pending with the full FCC.  Pet. App. 8a \nn.1.  When the FCC decides that application for review, its \ndecision will then be reviewable under the Hobbs Act in a \ncourt of appeals.  28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2342(1); 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 402(a).\nThe ongoing FCC proceedings make this case differ-\nent from PDR Network, where the relevant FCC order \n(by the full Commission) had issued many years before \nthe relevant private-party litigation.  588 U.S. at 3.  The \nprovisional nature of the FCC order here poses several \nproblems for review.\n1. \nA decision by the FCC while this case \nis pending could prevent the Court from \nreaching the question presented\nBecause FCC proceedings are ongoing, the Commis-\nsion could decide the pending application for review before \nthis Court issued its decision on the merits.  And which-\never side lost before the full Commission could then seek \nHobbs Act review of that decision in a court of appeals.\n\n29\nThe outcome of those further administrative (and \npossibly judicial) proceedings could fundamentally change \nthe nature of this case and hinder this Court\u2019s ability to \nanswer the question presented.  For example, it is not \nclear what would happen if the full Commission were to \ngrant the application for review and reverse the Bureau\u2019s \nAmerifactors order.  Under those circumstances, the FCC \norder on which respondents and the court of appeals relied \nwould no longer be in force, but a new order favoring \npetitioner would be.  \nOr if a court of appeals sets aside the full FCC\u2019s order \nduring the pendency of this case in this Court, there \nwould then be no FCC order at issue.  And a different \nquestion\u2014decided by the Ninth Circuit in an appeal ear-\nlier in this case\u2014could be presented:  is the decision of a \nHobbs Act court setting aside an FCC order binding on \nanother court deciding a dispute between private parties? \nSee True Health Chiropractic, 896 F.3d at 930 (answering \nyes); accord Gorss Motels, Inc. v. FCC, 20 F.4th 87, 96 (2d \nCir. 2021); Sandusky Wellness Ctr., LLC v. ASD Specialty \nHealthcare, Inc., 863 F.3d 460, 467-468 (6th Cir. 2017).\nThese and other scenarios made possible by Ameri-\nfactors\u2019 pendency greatly increase the risk of a dismissal \nRI\u0003WKH\u0003SHWLWLRQ\u0003DV\u0003LPSURYLGHQWO\\\u0003JUDQWHG\u000f\u0003D\u0003\u00c0QGLQJ\u0003RI\u0003\nmootness, or a remand to the Ninth Circuit based solely \non Amerifactors-related developments.  Any of those out-\ncomes would prevent the Court from reaching the question \npresented.  This risk can be eliminated if the Court waits \nto revisit the PDR Network question in a case in which \nthe FCC order was issued by the full Commission and is \nno longer subject to judicial review.\n\n30\n2. \nStrategic decisions by petitioner and its \ncounsel in the FCC proceedings could \npreclude challenging the FCC\u2019s order, \nindependent of the Hobbs Act \nPetitioner made a strategic choice not to participate \nin the administrative proceeding whose (interim) outcome \nit now complains about.  But its attorneys in their own \nnames are participating in a related FCC proceeding pre-\nsenting the same question.  See supra pp. 8-9 (discussing \nRyerson).  Both those circumstances distinguish this case \nfrom PDR Network and render it an unappealing vehicle \nfor consideration of the question presented.\nIn PDR Network, the relevant FCC decision came \nseven years before the fax advertisements at issue.  588 \nU.S. at 3.  This Court noted that the APA \u201cprovides that \n\u2018agency action is subject to judicial review in civil or \ncriminal proceedings for judicial enforcement\u2019 except \u2018to \nthe extent that [a] prior, adequate, and exclusive oppor-\ntunity for judicial review is provided by law.\u2019\u201d  Id. at 7 \n(quoting 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 703) (emphasis by Court).  The Court \nWKXV\u0003\u00c1DJJHG\u0003WKH\u0003TXHVWLRQ\u0003ZKHWKHU\u0003WKH\u0003+REEV\u0003$FW\u0003KDG\u0003\nafforded the defendant in PDR Network an \u201cadequate\u201d \nopportunity for review, given that the deadline for seek-\ning it had passed years before the private-party litigation \neven started.

Pet. App. 46a; see supra p. 8.  \nPetitioner easily could have participated in the FCC \nproceedings\u2014and could have asked for a stay of the dis-\ntrict court litigation while it did so.  See, e.g., Advanced \nRehab & Med., P.C. v. Amedisys Holding, LLC, No. 1:17-\nCV-1149, 2022 WL 1555240, at *2 (W.D. Tenn. May 17, 2022) \n(staying class action \u201cpending resolution of the applica-\ntion for review of the Amerifactors determination\u201d).  Its \nstrategic decision not to do so should bar it from seeking \na different answer here\u2014regardless of whether FCC \ndeterminations are more broadly binding in private-party \nlitigation.  See Port of Boston Marine Terminal Ass\u2019n, \n400 U.S. at 72.  When a party\u2019s \u201cinterests [are] clearly at \nstake\u201d in an administrative proceeding and it \u201chad every \nopportunity to participate\u201d in them and then \u201cseek timely \nreview in the Court of Appeals\u201d but \u201cchose not to do so,\u201d \u201cit \ncannot force collateral redetermination of the same issue \nin a different and inappropriate forum.\u201d  Ibid.  That rule\u2014\nwhich Justice Kavanaugh\u2019s PDR Network concurrence did \nnot mention, much less suggest was incorrect\u2014should \nprevent petitioner from challenging Amerifactors\u2019s con-\nclusion independent of the Hobbs Act, thus again leaving \nthe broader PDR Network question unresolved.\nAt the same time, the participation by petitioner\u2019s \ncounsel as a party in the ongoing Ryerson proceedings \nat the FCC raises a different problem.  In PDR Network, \nJustice Kavanaugh noted that a party that \u201cchallenges \n6.  Available at https://www.fcc.gov/ecfs/document/ \n 071870836381/1.\n\n32\nan agency action in a facial, pre-enforcement suit\u201d may \nbe prohibited \u201cby ordinary preclusion principles\u201d from \n\u201crelitigating\u201d the same question in an enforcement action. \n588 U.S. at 16 n.2.  To be sure, petitioner here has not par-\nticipated in Ryerson.  But its counsel has\u2014not on behalf \nof some other client, but in counsel\u2019s own name.  And it did \nso for a stated representational reason:   counsel advised \nthe FCC that it \u201crepresents clients across the country in \nprivate litigation\u201d in TCPA cases and that the FCC\u2019s deci-\nsion could impact them.  Anderson + Wanca Comments, \nsupra, at 1.  And all of counsel\u2019s Ryerson\u0003\u00c0OLQJV\u0003RFFXUUHG\u0003\nconcurrently with the district court litigation here; indeed, \nFRXQVHO\u0003\u00c0OHG\u0003LWV\u0003Ryerson application for review arguing \nthat Amerifactors was wrongly decided while respondents\u2019 \nmotion to decertify the class based on Amerifactors was \npending.  See supra pp. 8-9.\nA prior decision can be the basis for issue preclusion \neven as to non-parties in a variety of circumstances, \nincluding when there is a \u201cpre-existing substantive legal \nrelationship between the person to be bound and a party \nto the judgment\u201d and where the nonparty was \u201cadequately \nrepresented by someone with the same interests who \nwas a party.\u201d  Taylor v. Sturgell, 553 U.S. 880, 894 (2008) \n(quotation marks and brackets omitted).  Here, counsel \nand petitioner had a preexisting legal relationship and \ncounsel adequately represented petitioner\u2019s interests \nas to the online-fax-service issue when it participated in \nRyerson.  It is thus possible that normal preclusion prin-\nciples would bind petitioner to the result in Ryerson.  See \nPDR Network, 588 U.S. at 16 n.2 (Kavanaugh, J., concur-\nring); cf. Ferris v. Cuevas, 118 F.3d 122, 127, 130 (2d Cir. \n\u0014\u001c\u001c\u001a\f\u0003\u000bDSSO\\LQJ\u00031HZ\u0003<RUN\u0003ODZ\u0003DQG\u0003\u00c0QGLQJ\u0003UHV\u0003MXGLFDWD\u0003EDU\u0003\nbecause, among other reasons, attorneys in second case \nKDG\u0003DSSHDUHG\u0003LQ\u0003\u00c0UVW\u0003FDVH\u0003LQ\u0003WKHLU\u0003RZQ\u0003QDPHV\f\u0011\n\n33\nAt the very least, both of these issues would likely \ncomplicate the Court\u2019s review of the Hobbs Act question.7\nC. There Is A Mismatch Between The Question \nPresented And The Decision Below\nPetitioner\u2019s principal argument in the district court \nand court of appeals was that Amerifactors was not binding \nunder the Hobbs Act because it was a bureau-level deci-\nsion.  Pet. CA Principal & Resp. Br. 30-33.  It limited the \nbroader argument it now makes to a footnote in its merits \nbrief and to its rehearing petition.  Pet. CA Principal & \nResp. Br. 32 n.4; Pet. CA Reh\u2019g Pet.  This would impede the \nCourt\u2019s review of the question now presented in two ways.\nFirst, as a result of how petitioner briefed the case \nbelow, the Ninth Circuit\u2019s unpublished memorandum did \nnot engage on the broader question or even cite PDR \nNetwork.  Instead, it addressed only the argument it \nunderstood petitioner to be making\u2014that the Bureau\u2019s \nRUGHU\u0003ZDV\u0003QRW\u0003D\u0003\u00b4\u00c0QDO\u0003RUGHU\u00b5\u0003IRU\u0003SXUSRVHV\u0003RI\u0003WKH\u0003+REEV\u0003\nAct.  Pet. App. 8a.  Yet petitioner does not seek review of \nthat question, so there is a mismatch between the deci-\nsion below and the question petitioner wants this Court to \nGHFLGH\u0011\u0003\u00037KLV\u0003GHQLHV\u0003WKH\u0003&RXUW\u0003WKH\u0003EHQH\u00c0W\u0003RI\u0003D\u0003UHDVRQHG\u0003\ndecision to review that addresses the question in light \nof PDR Network.  The Court generally does not grant \ncertiorari in that situation.  See Cutter v. Wilkinson, 544 \nU.S. 709, 718 n.7 (2005) (\u201c[W]e are a court of review, not \nRI\u0003\u00c0UVW\u0003YLHZ\u0011\u00b5\f\u0011\n7.  Respondents had no reason to raise these complications \nbelow because petitioner did not make the argument it is pressing \nhere, and no decision has yet triggered preclusion.  See infra Part \nIII.C.\n\n34\nSecond, petitioner nowhere disclaims the argument it \nmade to the court of appeals.  If petitioner\u2019s merits brief \nwere to revive that argument involving the bureau-level \nnature of the FCC order, the case could end up focused on \nthat idiosyncrasy.  Again, this possibility for distraction \nmakes this a poor vehicle for review.\n'\u0011\u0003 $Q\u0003$OWHUQDWLYH\u0003*URXQG\u0003)RU\u0003$I\u00c0UPDQFH\u0003%DVHG\u0003\nOn The Plain Statutory Text Makes This A \nPoor Vehicle\n$Q\u0003REYLRXV\u0003DOWHUQDWLYH\u0003JURXQG\u0003IRU\u0003DI\u00c0UPDQFH\u00b3WKH\u0003\nFCC\u2019s interpretation of the statute is plainly correct as a \nde novo matter\u2014could prevent the Court from deciding \nthe question presented.  \nAs discussed above, respondents have argued all \nalong that the statute plainly does not cover online fax \nservices, and they would make that argument again as \nDQ\u0003DOWHUQDWLYH\u0003JURXQG\u0003IRU\u0003DI\u00c0UPDQFH\u0003LI\u0003FHUWLRUDUL\u0003ZHUH\u0003\ngranted.  See supra pp. 20-26.

Petitioner argued below that the Sixth Circuit in Lyngaas \nv. Ag, 992 F.3d 412 (2021), supports its statutory argument that \nthe TCPA applies to online fax services.  But as the Fourth Circuit \nhas explained, that is incorrect.

The district \ncourt there found Amerifactors binding under the Hobbs \nAct.  See Career Counseling, Inc. v. Amerifactors Finan-\ncial Group, LLC, No. 3:16-cv-03013, 2021 WL 3022677, \nat *8-*10 (D.S.C. July 16, 2021).  On appeal, the plaintiff \n\u201cargue[d] that the district court committed legal error \nin according Hobbs Act deference to the Ameri[f]actors \nFCC Ruling that an online fax service does not qualify as \na \u2018telephone facsimile machine\u2019 under the TCPA.\u201d  Career \nCounseling, 91 F.4th at 208.  \nBut the Fourth Circuit concluded that it \u201cneed not \nassess or determine whether the district court erred in \naccording Hobbs Act deference to the Ameri[f]actors \nFCC ruling.\u201d  Id. at 209.  That was so because it was \n\u00b4VDWLV\u00c0HG\u0003WR\u0003UXOH\u00b3GH\u0003QRYR\u00b3WKDW\u0003SXUVXDQW\u0003WR\u0003LWV\u0003SODLQ\u0003\nstatutory language, the TCPA prohibits the sending of \nunsolicited advertisements to what the district court \nlabelled as \u2018stand-alone fax machines,\u2019 but not to what the \ncourt accepted to be \u2018online fax services.\u2019\u201d  Ibid.  That \nsame path of least resistance is present here.  \nAnd were this Court to disregard the statutory ques-\ntion and reverse the Ninth Circuit on the Hobbs Act, \nthat court on remand would then likely come to the same \nconclusion based on the plain statutory text.  If the Court \nwants to address the Hobbs Act question, it should await \na case where it might matter to the ultimate outcome.\n\n36\nCONCLUSION\nThe petition for a writ of certiorari should be denied.\nRespectfully submittted,\nDEANNE E.

          "task_beliefs": "My foundational understanding of this case (*McLaughlin v. McKesson*, Docket 23-1226) is that it concerns whether the Hobbs Act compels a district court to defer to an FCC interpretation of the TCPA. My beliefs have been progressively refined:\n\n1.  **Petitioner's Stance and Core Argument:** The petitioner, McLaughlin, argues that the Ninth Circuit erred in holding that the Hobbs Act required the district court to be bound by the FCC's legal interpretation. They contend the Hobbs Act's grant of exclusive jurisdiction to appellate courts to *set aside* agency orders does not prevent a defendant in a later private enforcement action from arguing that the agency's interpretation of the underlying statute is incorrect.\n2.  **The Centrality of *PDR Network*:** The case *PDR Network, LLC v. Carlton & Harris Chiropractic, Inc.* (2019) is the direct predicate for this petition. The Supreme Court granted certiorari on the same question in that case but remanded without a decision. McLaughlin's petition is framed as a \"clean vehicle\" to resolve the question left unanswered in *PDR Network*.\n3.  **Neutralizing the *PDR Network* Obstacles:** The petitioner argues this case is a better vehicle because the two issues that complicated *PDR Network* are absent: (1) the distinction between interpretive and legislative rules is moot due to Ninth Circuit precedent applying the Hobbs Act to both, and (2) the petitioner did not raise the \"prior and adequate opportunity for review\" argument.\n4.  **The \"Kavanaugh Concurrence\" Strategy:** The petitioner's argument heavily mirrors Justice Kavanaugh's concurrence in *PDR Network* (joined by Thomas, Alito, and Gorsuch), which argued the Hobbs Act does not bar a district court from considering the correctness of an agency's interpretation. This is a clear strategy to appeal to a pre-existing four-justice bloc.\n5.  **The Specific FCC Interpretation:** The agency action at issue is the FCC's 2019 *Amerifactors* declaratory ruling, which interpreted a \"telephone facsimile machine\" under the TCPA to exclude online fax services that receive faxes as emails. This interpretation led to the adverse rulings against the petitioner in the lower courts.\n6.  **Acknowledged Epistemic Imbalance (New):** My current understanding is based entirely on the petitioner's framing of the case via the cert petition. This knowledge is inherently one-sided and potentially biased. I have a clear picture of the petitioner's arguments but no information about the respondent's (McKesson's) counterarguments. My confidence in any prediction is therefore low and provisional. The most critical piece of missing information is the respondent's Brief in Opposition, which will be necessary to form a balanced view of the legal conflict.",
          "design_beliefs": "My initial set of heuristics for SCOTUS prediction has been tested and significantly enhanced. My methodology has evolved from a general framework to a more specific and powerful set of analytical strategies.\n\n1.  **Problem Decomposition Strategy:** This remains a valid foundational strategy for separating task-level learning (\u03b8) from meta-level learning (D).\n2.  **Case Categorization Heuristic:** My categorization has been refined from \"administrative law\" to the more precise sub-domain of **the preclusive effect of jurisdictional statutes (like the Hobbs Act) on judicial review of agency interpretations in subsequent enforcement proceedings.**\n3.  **Source Prioritization Heuristic:** The cert petition is confirmed as a high-value initial source. My strategy is now refined to follow a logical document progression: **(1) Petition for Certiorari, (2) Brief in Opposition, (3) Petitioner's Reply Brief, and then (4) Amicus Briefs.** This sequence provides a structured, adversarial narrative of the case as it is presented to the Court.\n4.  **Contextual Analysis Strategy:** This remains crucial, focusing not just on the Court's general jurisprudence but on the specific, articulated views of key justices on the precise statutory question.\n5.  **Precedent-Chaining Strategy:** This heuristic, developed from the last observation, is confirmed as essential. Identifying \"near miss\" cases like *PDR Network* where the Court granted cert but did not decide the merits provides an invaluable map of the justices' thinking.\n6.  **\"Vehicle\" Analysis Heuristic:** This remains a key lens. A case's procedural \"cleanliness\" is a major factor in predicting a cert grant. I now understand that a key part of this analysis involves anticipating how the respondent will attempt to \"dirty the vehicle\" by introducing procedural or factual complications to argue against review.\n7.  **Justice-Specific Argument Tracking:** This is a critical strategy. Litigants build arguments to appeal to previously expressed judicial views (e.g., McLaughlin using the Kavanaugh concurrence). My analysis must not only identify this targeting but also anticipate the respondent's counter-strategy against that specific bloc.\n8.  **Adversarial Analysis & Uncertainty Reduction (New Heuristic):** The most recent observation highlights a core meta-cognitive principle. An effective analytical process must involve explicitly modeling its own knowledge gaps and biases. After analyzing one side's argument, the highest priority becomes actively seeking out the opposing viewpoint (e.g., the Brief in Opposition). This practice of seeking disconfirming evidence or adversarial perspectives is crucial for reducing uncertainty, correcting for the initial framing of the case, and building a robust, balanced predictive model. This moves beyond passive information gathering to a targeted, uncertainty-driven inquiry."

In *PDR*, a defendant's liability was expanded by an agency rule. Here, a plaintiff is challenging an agency order that *limits* a defendant's liability.

When a petition presents a complex jurisdictional or procedural question, the first thing to check in the BIO is for a simpler, statutory argument that would resolve the case without reaching the question presented.

          "task_beliefs": "My understanding of *McLaughlin v. McKesson* (Docket 23-1226) has evolved from a one-sided view based on the petitioner's arguments to a more balanced, adversarial perspective incorporating the respondent's powerful counter-arguments. My confidence in the Supreme Court granting certiorari has significantly decreased.\n\n1.  **Petitioner's Stance and Core Argument:** This remains stable. The petitioner, McLaughlin, argues the Ninth Circuit erred by holding that the Hobbs Act binds a district court to an FCC legal interpretation. They contend a defendant in a private TCPA action can challenge the correctness of the agency's statutory interpretation, and the Hobbs Act's exclusive review provision for *setting aside* agency orders does not preclude this defense.\n2.  **The Centrality of *PDR Network*:** This case is still fundamentally a sequel to *PDR Network, LLC v. Carlton & Harris Chiropractic, Inc.* (2019). However, its relationship to that precedent is now contested. While the petitioner presents it as the \"ideal vehicle\" to resolve the question left open in *PDR Network*, the respondent, McKesson, argues it is a \"flawed vehicle\" for precisely that purpose.\n3.  **The \"Clean Vehicle\" Narrative vs. \"Vehicle Dirtying\" (New, Contested Information):**\n    *   **Petitioner's Claim:** McLaughlin argues this case is a \"clean\" vehicle because the issues that complicated *PDR Network* (interpretive vs. legislative rule distinction, prior opportunity for review) are absent.\n    *   **Respondent's Counter-Argument:** McKesson has systematically \"dirtied\" the vehicle by introducing several critical complications. They argue the case is a poor candidate for review because:\n        *   **Alternative Ground for Affirmance:** The Court does not need to reach the Hobbs Act question at all. McKesson argues the TCPA's plain text resolves the case. The statute defines a \"telephone facsimile machine\" as equipment with the capacity to \"transcribe...onto paper.\" Since the online fax services at issue receive faxes as emails, they lack this capacity and are not covered by the statute. If the Court agrees, it can affirm the Ninth Circuit's judgment on this simpler statutory basis, making the Hobbs Act question irrelevant to the case's outcome.\n        *   **Ongoing Agency Proceedings:** The FCC order at issue (*Amerifactors*) was issued by a bureau, not the full Commission, and an application for its review is currently pending before the full FCC. The Court is unlikely to intervene while the agency's own internal review process is incomplete, as future agency action could alter or moot the legal question.\n4.  **The \"Kavanaugh Concurrence\" Strategy and Its Undercutting (New, Contested Information):**\n    *   **Petitioner's Strategy:** The petitioner's argument is tailored to the four-justice concurrence in *PDR Network* authored by Justice Kavanaugh, which raised due process concerns about a defendant being unable to challenge an agency interpretation in an enforcement action.\n    *   **Respondent's Rebuttal:** McKesson argues this strategy is inapplicable here because the parties' positions are reversed. In *PDR Network*, a *defendant* was challenging a rule that expanded its liability. Here, a *plaintiff* (McLaughlin) is challenging a declaratory order (*Amerifactors*) that *limits* a defendant's liability. McKesson asserts that the due process concerns animating the Kavanaugh concurrence are entirely absent when a plaintiff, not a defendant, is the one attacking the agency order.\n5.  **The Specific FCC Interpretation:** The core agency action remains the FCC's 2019 *Amerifactors* declaratory ruling, which concluded that online fax services are not \"telephone facsimile machines\" under the TCPA. My understanding is now enriched by McKesson's argument that this ruling is not just a binding order under the Hobbs Act, but is also *correct* on the merits based on the TCPA's plain text.\n6.  **Correcting the Epistemic Imbalance:** My previous belief state correctly identified a critical knowledge gap: the respondent's arguments. The Brief in Opposition has filled this gap, shifting my analysis from \"what is the petitioner's best case?\" to \"how strong are the competing arguments?\". The respondent's arguments regarding the alternative statutory ground and the prudential problem of ongoing agency review appear very strong and are common reasons for the Court to deny certiorari.",
          "design_beliefs": "My meta-level framework for analyzing SCOTUS cases has been significantly validated and refined by this observation. The process of moving from a one-sided petition to a two-sided adversarial contest has proven to be the most critical step in the analysis.\n\n1.  **Problem Decomposition Strategy:** Remains a valid foundational strategy.\n2.  **Case Categorization Heuristic:** My categorization of the case as concerning **the preclusive effect of jurisdictional statutes (like the Hobbs Act) on judicial review** is still accurate, but I now add a crucial sub-category: **the role of alternative statutory grounds and prudential ripeness in SCOTUS vehicle selection.**\n3.  **Source Prioritization Heuristic:** The sequence of **(1) Petition for Certiorari \u2192 (2) Brief in Opposition** is confirmed as the essential dialectical process for cert-stage analysis. The BIO is not merely supplemental; it is the primary source for identifying fatal or significant flaws in a petition.\n4.  **Contextual Analysis Strategy:** Remains crucial. The analysis of the Kavanaugh concurrence was correct, but incomplete without the respondent's counter-argument showing how the factual posture of this case neutralizes the concurrence's reasoning.\n5.  **Precedent-Chaining Strategy:** Remains essential. The link to *PDR Network* is the core of the case, but the key analytical task is now understanding the arguments for why this case is *different* from, and a *worse vehicle* than, *PDR Network*.\n6.  **\"Vehicle\" Analysis Heuristic (Refined and Enhanced):** This heuristic has become more sophisticated. It's not just about checking for \"cleanliness\" but about modeling the adversarial process of \"polishing\" and \"dirtying\" the vehicle. I now explicitly look for specific \"vehicle-dirtying\" tactics from the respondent:\n    *   **The Alternative Ground for Affirmance:** Highlighting a simpler, non-constitutional, or non-jurisdictional reason the lower court's judgment was correct. This is a powerful \"off-ramp\" for the Court.\n    *   **Prudential/Ripeness Concerns:** Arguing the case is not ready for review due to ongoing proceedings or other contingencies.\n    *   **Factual/Postural Distinction:** Demonstrating how the current case differs from the key precedent the petitioner relies on in a way that makes the legal question less compelling.\n7.  **Justice-Specific Argument Tracking:** This remains critical. The observation confirms that a sophisticated analysis involves not just identifying litigant targeting of a Justice's stated views, but anticipating the opponent's strategy for distinguishing or neutralizing that appeal.\n8.  **Adversarial Analysis & Uncertainty Reduction (Validated and Confirmed):** This heuristic has been proven to be the most important principle so far. My previous belief state correctly identified the BIO as the key to reducing uncertainty. This observation confirms that a one-sided analysis is inherently fragile. The primary goal after reading a petition must be to seek out the opposing arguments, which are the most potent source of disconfirming evidence and the fastest path to a robust predictive model.\n9.  **Statutory Off-Ramp Analysis (New Heuristic):** A new, specific heuristic has emerged from this observation. When a case presents a complex procedural or jurisdictional question, the first thing to look for in the Brief in Opposition is a \"statutory off-ramp\"\u2014a straightforward argument based on the plain text of the underlying statute that would allow the Court to resolve the case without ever reaching the difficult question presented in the petition. The presence of a plausible off-ramp significantly decreases the likelihood of a cert grant."

Carlton & Harris Chiropractic, Inc., 588 \nU.S. 1 (2019): Does the Hobbs Act require a district court \nto accept the FCC\u2019s legal interpretation of the TCPA? \nThe respondents do not deny that this is an important \nand recurring question of federal law on which the circuits \nare divided\u2014just as it was when the Court granted review \nin PDR Network. Nor do they deny that the Ninth Circuit \nbelow applied its controlling precedent on this question \nand held that the district court \u201ccorrectly found that it was \nbound by\u201d the FCC\u2019s legal interpretation of the TCPA. \nPet. App. 7a. And, importantly, the respondents do not \ncontend that either of the \u201ctwo preliminary issues\u201d that \nultimately frustrated resolution of the question presented \nin PDR Network, 588 U.S. at 4, will do the same here. \nNevertheless, the respondents spend 36 pages trying \nto convince the Court that it should pass up the chance to \nfinally resolve this important question and the split that it \nhas caused. Their arguments pose no barrier to review.   \nA. The respondents first argue (at 13\u201316) that there is \nno \u201cpost-PDR Network split about interpretive rules,\u201d \nand that deciding the question that this Court intended to \ndecide five years ago would be \u201cpremature.\u201d But the \npetition asks the Court to resolve the circuit split on the \nquestion presented, which goes well beyond interpretive \nrules. That split prompted the Court to grant certiorari in \nPDR Network, and it still exists today. Nor does it matter \nwhether the FCC\u2019s Amerifactors order is properly \nclassified as the equivalent of an interpretive rule (as the \nrespondents argued below). What matters is that, as the \ndistrict court below recognized, controlling Ninth Circuit \nprecedent treats the Amerifactors order as binding under \n\n- 2 - \n \nthe Hobbs Act regardless of how it\u2019s characterized. So the \nfirst preliminary issue identified in PDR Network stands \nas no obstacle to reaching the question presented here. \nNor would it be premature for the Court to decide that \nquestion now. The issue was ripe in 2018, when the Court \ngranted certiorari in PDR Network. And since then, the \nneed for authoritative resolution has only grown. Within \nmonths of this Court\u2019s decision declining to resolve the \nsplit, a full panel of the Eleventh Circuit called on that \ncourt \u201cto correct [its] mistake en banc\u201d \u201cin the earliest \nappropriate case.\u201d Gorss Motels, Inc. v. Safemark Sys., \nLP, 931 F.3d 1094, 1106 (11th Cir. 2019) (Pryor, J., \nconcurring). But neither that court nor the Ninth Circuit \nin this case has done so. As a result, the pre-PDR Network \nsplit is alive and well. It now falls to this Court to bring \nneeded uniformity to the law on this important question. \nB. The respondents then turn to the merits (at 16\u201326). \nThe argue that the answer to the question presented is \nyes\u2014the Hobbs Act requires a district court in an as-\napplied enforcement proceeding to accept the FCC\u2019s legal \ninterpretation of the TCPA. That is so, they say, because \notherwise the court would have to \u201cdetermine whether the \nagency\u2019s interpretation is \u2018sound [or] good,\u2019\u201d which the \nHobbs Act (in their view) prevents it from doing. BIO 17. \nThis argument was squarely rejected by four Justices in \nPDR Network, and the question to be resolved here will \nbe whether their reading of the Hobbs Act is correct. The \npetitioner says it is; the respondents say it\u2019s not. The point \nof plenary review will be to determine who\u2019s right. \nYet the bulk of the respondents\u2019 merits section is not \nabout the text of the Hobbs Act\u2014or even about the Hobbs \nAct at all. It is instead about whether the FCC was right \nto interpret the TCPA the way that it did. See BIO 21\u201326. \nBut that issue, which the Ninth Circuit did not reach, will \n\n- 3 - \n \nbe an issue for a lower court on remand. It has nothing to \ndo with the question presented and will not \u201cprevent the \nCourt from deciding the question presented.\u201d Contra BIO \n34. The question presented is whether a district court is \nbarred from even conducting a statutory analysis, not who \nwill prevail here should the court be permitted to do so.   \nC. Finally, the respondents make a vehicle argument. \nSee BIO 27\u201335. They claim that there are two distinctions \nbetween this case and PDR Network that make this case \nan unsuitable replacement for PDR Network. The most \n\u201cfundamental difference,\u201d in their eyes (at 17), is that in \nPDR Network, the party arguing that the Hobbs Act does \nnot require a district court to accept the FCC\u2019s legal \ninterpretation of the TCPA was the defendant, whereas \nhere it\u2019s the plaintiff. The respondents contend that this \nCourt \u201cshould await a case in which a defendant questions \nthe statutory interpretation in an FCC order.\u201d BIO 3.  \nBut the question presented is about the meaning of a \nstatute. And the Hobbs Act contains no hint that it means \nsomething different depending on which party is invoking \nit. Either the statute requires a district court to adhere to \nthe FCC\u2019s interpretation of the TCPA in an enforcement \naction or it does not. But the answer will not be different \ndepending on who happens to benefit from the FCC order. \nNor did Justice Kavanaugh, in his concurrence in PDR \nNetwork, suggest any such reading of the statute. To the \ncontrary, his reading applies to plaintiffs and defendants \nalike. See 588 U.S. at 27 (\u201cIn an as-applied enforcement \naction, the district court should interpret the statute as \ncourts traditionally do under the usual principles of \nstatutory interpretation . . . .\u201d). Although his opinion often \nframes the issue from the vantage point of a TCPA \ndefendant, it does so because that was the posture of that \ncase\u2014not because its textual analysis is reserved solely \n\n- 4 - \n \nfor the benefit of defendants. Contra BIO 18\u201319; see also \nGorss, 931 F.3d at 1109 (Pryor, J., concurring) (observing \nthat a \u201cstark implication[] of our misconstruction of the \nHobbs Act\u201d is that \u201ca plaintiff with a viable claim under \nthe law Congress enacted may be unable to pursue it \nsimply because an agency has misinterpreted the law in \nan order to which he was a not a party\u201d). No circuit, \nincluding the Ninth Circuit, has drawn any such atextual \ndistinction. Indeed, not even the respondents argue that \nthe statute\u2019s text could mean one thing for defendants and \nanother for plaintiffs. They simply disagree with Justice \nKavanaugh\u2019s textual analysis, thus underscoring the \nappropriateness of this case as a vehicle. \nThe respondents also try to make something of the fact \nthat the FCC order in PDR Network predated that case \nby many years, whereas this case was filed six years \nbefore the Amerifactors order. That distinction, however, \nhas no bearing on the question presented. Unlike in PDR \nNetwork, the petitioner here never argued that it lacked a \nprior or adequate opportunity for review under the Hobbs \nAct, which was the second preliminary issue noted in this \nCourt\u2019s opinion. So this difference, if anything, makes this \ncase a better vehicle than PDR Network, not a worse one. \nNor is there any realistic possibility that FCC action \nwill affect this Court\u2019s review. The respondents speculate \n(at 28) that the FCC could thwart review by acting on a \nfour-year-old application and reversing the Amerifactors \norder. But the respondents give no reason to think that \nthis will actually happen, and the theoretical possibility \nthat an agency could later change its mind is no reason for \nthis Court to stay its hand when the agency action is \ncausing real harm to real people. And here, not only is \nthere no deadline for the FCC to act, 47 U.S.C. 155(c)(4), \nbut the respondents point to no example of the FCC ever \n\n- 5 - \n \noverturning an interpretation that had been reached on \ndelegated authority, much less doing so without first \nengaging in notice and comment. Far from offering a \nreason why the FCC will reverse course, the respondents \ndo the opposite: They say that the order represents the \nFCC\u2019s \u201cinformed judgment\u201d and is \u201cobvious[ly]\u201d correct. \nBIO 26, 34. Again, if the respondents are right about what \nthe TCPA means, they should prevail on the merits on \nremand\u2014but only because a court reached that \nconclusion, not because an agency did so.  \nAs for the respondents\u2019 argument that the petitioner \nshould be bound by the FCC\u2019s order under \u201cnormal \npreclusion principles,\u201d BIO 32, that argument is even \nmore off-base. It is wrong, independent of the question \npresented, and waived to boot. The petitioner was entitled \nto make its statutory arguments\u2014and to continue seeking \nas-applied relief\u2014in the same case that it had been \nlitigating for six years before the FCC order. It was not \nrequired to halt that litigation and pursue the \u201cconvoluted \nroute\u201d of Hobbs Act review. PDR Network, 588 U.S. at 25 \n(Kavanaugh, J., concurring). But that\u2019s an argument that \ncan be dealt with by the Ninth Circuit on remand, along \nwith the question of whether the respondents have even \npreserved the issue. It is not an impediment to this Court\u2019s \nreview. \nCONCLUSION \n The petition for certiorari should be granted. \n\n- 6 - \n \n \n \n \n \n       Respectfully submitted, \nMATTHEW W.H.

What matters is that, as the \ndistrict court below recognized, controlling Ninth Circuit \nprecedent treats the Amerifactors order as binding under \n\n- 2 - \n \nthe Hobbs Act regardless of how it\u2019s characterized. So the \nfirst preliminary issue identified in PDR Network stands \nas no obstacle to reaching the question presented here. \nNor would it be premature for the Court to decide that \nquestion now. The issue was ripe in 2018, when the Court \ngranted certiorari in PDR Network. And since then, the \nneed for authoritative resolution has only grown. Within \nmonths of this Court\u2019s decision declining to resolve the \nsplit, a full panel of the Eleventh Circuit called on that \ncourt \u201cto correct [its] mistake en banc\u201d \u201cin the earliest \nappropriate case.\u201d Gorss Motels, Inc. v. Safemark Sys., \nLP, 931 F.3d 1094, 1106 (11th Cir. 2019) (Pryor, J., \nconcurring). But neither that court nor the Ninth Circuit \nin this case has done so. As a result, the pre-PDR Network \nsplit is alive and well. It now falls to this Court to bring \nneeded uniformity to the law on this important question. \nB. The respondents then turn to the merits (at 16\u201326). \nThe argue that the answer to the question presented is \nyes\u2014the Hobbs Act requires a district court in an as-\napplied enforcement proceeding to accept the FCC\u2019s legal \ninterpretation of the TCPA. That is so, they say, because \notherwise the court would have to \u201cdetermine whether the \nagency\u2019s interpretation is \u2018sound [or] good,\u2019\u201d which the \nHobbs Act (in their view) prevents it from doing. BIO 17. \nThis argument was squarely rejected by four Justices in \nPDR Network, and the question to be resolved here will \nbe whether their reading of the Hobbs Act is correct. The \npetitioner says it is; the respondents say it\u2019s not. The point \nof plenary review will be to determine who\u2019s right. \nYet the bulk of the respondents\u2019 merits section is not \nabout the text of the Hobbs Act\u2014or even about the Hobbs \nAct at all. It is instead about whether the FCC was right \nto interpret the TCPA the way that it did. See BIO 21\u201326. \nBut that issue, which the Ninth Circuit did not reach, will \n\n- 3 - \n \nbe an issue for a lower court on remand. It has nothing to \ndo with the question presented and will not \u201cprevent the \nCourt from deciding the question presented.\u201d Contra BIO \n34. The question presented is whether a district court is \nbarred from even conducting a statutory analysis, not who \nwill prevail here should the court be permitted to do so.   \nC. Finally, the respondents make a vehicle argument. \nSee BIO 27\u201335. They claim that there are two distinctions \nbetween this case and PDR Network that make this case \nan unsuitable replacement for PDR Network. The most \n\u201cfundamental difference,\u201d in their eyes (at 17), is that in \nPDR Network, the party arguing that the Hobbs Act does \nnot require a district court to accept the FCC\u2019s legal \ninterpretation of the TCPA was the defendant, whereas \nhere it\u2019s the plaintiff. The respondents contend that this \nCourt \u201cshould await a case in which a defendant questions \nthe statutory interpretation in an FCC order.\u201d BIO 3.  \nBut the question presented is about the meaning of a \nstatute. And the Hobbs Act contains no hint that it means \nsomething different depending on which party is invoking \nit. Either the statute requires a district court to adhere to \nthe FCC\u2019s interpretation of the TCPA in an enforcement \naction or it does not. But the answer will not be different \ndepending on who happens to benefit from the FCC order. \nNor did Justice Kavanaugh, in his concurrence in PDR \nNetwork, suggest any such reading of the statute. To the \ncontrary, his reading applies to plaintiffs and defendants \nalike. See 588 U.S. at 27 (\u201cIn an as-applied enforcement \naction, the district court should interpret the statute as \ncourts traditionally do under the usual principles of \nstatutory interpretation . . . .\u201d). Although his opinion often \nframes the issue from the vantage point of a TCPA \ndefendant, it does so because that was the posture of that \ncase\u2014not because its textual analysis is reserved solely \n\n- 4 - \n \nfor the benefit of defendants. Contra BIO 18\u201319; see also \nGorss, 931 F.3d at 1109 (Pryor, J., concurring) (observing \nthat a \u201cstark implication[] of our misconstruction of the \nHobbs Act\u201d is that \u201ca plaintiff with a viable claim under \nthe law Congress enacted may be unable to pursue it \nsimply because an agency has misinterpreted the law in \nan order to which he was a not a party\u201d). No circuit, \nincluding the Ninth Circuit, has drawn any such atextual \ndistinction. Indeed, not even the respondents argue that \nthe statute\u2019s text could mean one thing for defendants and \nanother for plaintiffs. They simply disagree with Justice \nKavanaugh\u2019s textual analysis, thus underscoring the \nappropriateness of this case as a vehicle. \nThe respondents also try to make something of the fact \nthat the FCC order in PDR Network predated that case \nby many years, whereas this case was filed six years \nbefore the Amerifactors order. That distinction, however, \nhas no bearing on the question presented. Unlike in PDR \nNetwork, the petitioner here never argued that it lacked a \nprior or adequate opportunity for review under the Hobbs \nAct, which was the second preliminary issue noted in this \nCourt\u2019s opinion. So this difference, if anything, makes this \ncase a better vehicle than PDR Network, not a worse one. \nNor is there any realistic possibility that FCC action \nwill affect this Court\u2019s review. The respondents speculate \n(at 28) that the FCC could thwart review by acting on a \nfour-year-old application and reversing the Amerifactors \norder. But the respondents give no reason to think that \nthis will actually happen, and the theoretical possibility \nthat an agency could later change its mind is no reason for \nthis Court to stay its hand when the agency action is \ncausing real harm to real people. And here, not only is \nthere no deadline for the FCC to act, 47 U.S.C. 155(c)(4), \nbut the respondents point to no example of the FCC ever \n\n- 5 - \n \noverturning an interpretation that had been reached on \ndelegated authority, much less doing so without first \nengaging in notice and comment. Far from offering a \nreason why the FCC will reverse course, the respondents \ndo the opposite: They say that the order represents the \nFCC\u2019s \u201cinformed judgment\u201d and is \u201cobvious[ly]\u201d correct. \nBIO 26, 34. Again, if the respondents are right about what \nthe TCPA means, they should prevail on the merits on \nremand\u2014but only because a court reached that \nconclusion, not because an agency did so.  \nAs for the respondents\u2019 argument that the petitioner \nshould be bound by the FCC\u2019s order under \u201cnormal \npreclusion principles,\u201d BIO 32, that argument is even \nmore off-base. It is wrong, independent of the question \npresented, and waived to boot. The petitioner was entitled \nto make its statutory arguments\u2014and to continue seeking \nas-applied relief\u2014in the same case that it had been \nlitigating for six years before the FCC order. It was not \nrequired to halt that litigation and pursue the \u201cconvoluted \nroute\u201d of Hobbs Act review. PDR Network, 588 U.S. at 25 \n(Kavanaugh, J., concurring). But that\u2019s an argument that \ncan be dealt with by the Ninth Circuit on remand, along \nwith the question of whether the respondents have even \npreserved the issue. It is not an impediment to this Court\u2019s \nreview. \nCONCLUSION \n The petition for certiorari should be granted. \n\n- 6 - \n \n \n \n \n \n       Respectfully submitted, \nMATTHEW W.H.

          "task_beliefs": "My understanding of *McLaughlin v. McKesson* (Docket 23-1226) has evolved from a one-sided view based on the petitioner's arguments to a more balanced, adversarial perspective incorporating the respondent's powerful counter-arguments. My confidence in the Supreme Court granting certiorari has significantly decreased.\n\n1.  **Petitioner's Stance and Core Argument:** This remains stable. The petitioner, McLaughlin, argues the Ninth Circuit erred by holding that the Hobbs Act binds a district court to an FCC legal interpretation. They contend a defendant in a private TCPA action can challenge the correctness of the agency's statutory interpretation, and the Hobbs Act's exclusive review provision for *setting aside* agency orders does not preclude this defense.\n\n2.  **The Centrality of *PDR Network*:** This case is still fundamentally a sequel to *PDR Network, LLC v. Carlton & Harris Chiropractic, Inc.* (2019). However, its relationship to that precedent is now highly contested. While the petitioner presents it as the \"ideal vehicle\" to resolve the question left open in *PDR Network*, the respondent, McKesson, has presented compelling arguments that it is a \"flawed vehicle\" for precisely that purpose.\n\n3.  **The \"Clean Vehicle\" Narrative vs. \"Vehicle Dirtying\" (New, Contested Information):** My previous analysis anticipated the respondent's attempt to \"dirty\" the vehicle, and the Brief in Opposition (BIO) has provided the specific arguments to do so. These arguments appear very strong and significantly weaken the case for certiorari.\n    *   **Petitioner's Claim:** McLaughlin argues this case is a \"clean\" vehicle because the issues that complicated *PDR Network* (interpretive vs. legislative rule distinction, prior opportunity for review) are absent.\n    *   **Respondent's Counter-Arguments (from BIO):** McKesson has systematically introduced several critical complications that serve as \"off-ramps\" for the Court:\n        *   **Alternative Ground for Affirmance (The \"Statutory Off-Ramp\"):** The Court does not need to reach the Hobbs Act question at all. McKesson argues the TCPA's plain text resolves the case. The statute defines a \"telephone facsimile machine\" as equipment with the capacity to \"transcribe...onto paper.\" Since the online fax services at issue receive faxes as emails, they lack this capacity and are not covered by the statute. If the Court agrees, it can affirm the Ninth Circuit's judgment on this simpler statutory basis, making the Hobbs Act question irrelevant to the case's outcome. This is a very powerful argument for denying review.\n        *   **Prudential Ripeness Concern:** The FCC order at issue (*Amerifactors*) was issued by a bureau, not the full Commission, and an application for its review is currently pending before the full FCC. The Court is highly unlikely to intervene while the agency's own internal review process is incomplete, as future agency action could alter or moot the legal question.\n        *   **Illusory Circuit Split:** McKesson argues the petitioner's claimed circuit split is not real because the cases cited involve different types of agency actions (e.g., adjudications vs. interpretive rules), making them inapplicable.\n\n4.  **The \"Kavanaugh Concurrence\" Strategy and Its Undercutting (New, Contested Information):** My understanding of this strategic element is now complete, incorporating the respondent's rebuttal.\n    *   **Petitioner's Strategy:** The petitioner's argument is tailored to the four-justice concurrence in *PDR Network* authored by Justice Kavanaugh, which raised due process concerns about a defendant being unable to challenge an agency interpretation in an enforcement action.\n    *   **Respondent's Rebuttal:** McKesson argues this strategy is inapplicable because the parties' positions are inverted. In *PDR Network*, a *defendant* was challenging a rule that expanded its liability. Here, a *plaintiff* (McLaughlin) is challenging a declaratory order (*Amerifactors*) that *limits* a defendant's liability. McKesson asserts that the due process concerns animating the Kavanaugh concurrence are entirely absent when a plaintiff, not a defendant, is the one attacking the agency order. This rebuttal appears to effectively neutralize the petitioner's primary hook for the conservative justices.\n\n5.  **The Specific FCC Interpretation:** The core agency action remains the FCC's 2019 *Amerifactors* declaratory ruling. My understanding is now enriched by McKesson's argument that this ruling is not just a binding order under the Hobbs Act, but is also *correct* on the merits based on the TCPA's plain text. This provides the Court with two distinct ways to agree with the outcome below without granting cert on the question presented.\n\n6.  **Updated Prediction & Uncertainty:** My epistemic imbalance has been corrected. The respondent's arguments are not just plausible; they are the kinds of arguments the Court frequently uses to deny certiorari. The presence of a strong alternative statutory ground and a clear prudential reason to wait (the pending FCC review) makes a grant of certiorari highly unlikely. My remaining uncertainty centers on whether the petitioner's Reply Brief can effectively rebut these \"vehicle\" problems.",
          "design_beliefs": "My meta-level framework for analyzing SCOTUS cases has been significantly validated and refined. The process of moving from a one-sided petition to a two-sided adversarial contest has proven to be the most critical step in the analysis.\n\n1.  **Problem Decomposition Strategy:** Remains a valid foundational strategy.\n2.  **Case Categorization Heuristic:** My categorization of the case as concerning **the preclusive effect of jurisdictional statutes (like the Hobbs Act)** is still accurate, but I have added the crucial sub-category: **the role of alternative statutory grounds and prudential ripeness in SCOTUS vehicle selection.**\n3.  **Source Prioritization Heuristic:** The sequence of **(1) Petition for Certiorari \u2192 (2) Brief in Opposition** is confirmed as the essential dialectical process. This observation elevates the importance of the BIO; it is not merely supplemental but is often the primary source for identifying fatal flaws and making an accurate prediction. A petition presents the *best possible version* of a case, while the BIO presents the *most realistic version*.\n4.  **Contextual Analysis Strategy:** Remains crucial. The analysis of the Kavanaugh concurrence was correct, but incomplete. This observation confirms that a complete analysis requires modeling how the opposing party will distinguish or neutralize such targeted arguments based on the specific facts and posture of the case.\n5.  **Precedent-Chaining Strategy:** Remains essential. The link to *PDR Network* is the core of the case, but the key analytical task is now understanding the arguments for why this case is *different* from, and a *worse vehicle* than, *PDR Network*.\n6.  **\"Vehicle\" Analysis Heuristic (Refined and Enhanced):** This heuristic has become more sophisticated. It's not just about checking for \"cleanliness\" but about modeling the adversarial process of \"polishing\" (petitioner) and \"dirtying\" (respondent) the vehicle. I now have a concrete checklist of \"vehicle-dirtying\" tactics to look for in a BIO:\n    *   **The Alternative Ground for Affirmance:** Highlighting a simpler, non-constitutional, or non-jurisdictional reason the lower court's judgment was correct.\n    *   **Prudential/Ripeness Concerns:** Arguing the case is not ready for review due to ongoing proceedings, lack of a final agency action, or other contingencies.\n    *   **Factual/Postural Distinction:** Demonstrating how the current case differs from the key precedent the petitioner relies on in a way that makes the legal question less compelling (e.g., the inversion of plaintiff/defendant roles here vs. *PDR Network*).\n    *   **Disputing the Circuit Split:** Arguing that the claimed split is illusory due to factual or legal distinctions between the cited cases.\n7.  **Justice-Specific Argument Tracking:** This remains critical. The observation confirms that a sophisticated analysis involves not just identifying litigant targeting of a Justice's stated views, but anticipating the opponent's strategy for distinguishing or neutralizing that appeal.\n8.  **Adversarial Analysis & Uncertainty Reduction (Validated and Confirmed):** This heuristic has been proven to be the most important principle so far. A one-sided analysis based only on a petition is inherently fragile and likely to overestimate the chances of a grant. The primary goal after reading a petition must be to seek out the opposing arguments in the BIO, which are the most potent source of disconfirming evidence and the fastest path to a robust predictive model.\n9.  **Statutory Off-Ramp Analysis (New Heuristic Solidified):** This has been confirmed as a powerful, specific heuristic. When a case presents a complex procedural, jurisdictional, or constitutional question, the first thing to look for in the BIO is a \"statutory off-ramp\"\u2014a straightforward argument based on the plain text of the underlying statute that would allow the Court to resolve the case without ever reaching the difficult question presented. The presence of a plausible off-ramp significantly decreases the likelihood of a cert grant. My next step will be to analyze the petitioner's Reply Brief to see if they can successfully argue this off-ramp is blocked."

My understanding of the task parameters (\u03b8) is comprehensive, covering the core arguments, the 'vehicle' defects raised by the respondent, and the petitioner's rebuttals. My design-level knowledge (D) has been refined, particularly regarding the dialectical nature of cert briefing and the specific tactics used to attack and defend a case's suitability for review.\n\nThe petitioner's Reply Brief effectively countered the respondent's strongest arguments.\n1.  It persuasively argued that the logic of Justice Kavanaugh's *PDR Network* concurrence applies symmetrically to both plaintiffs and defendants, neutralizing the 'inverted posture' argument.\n2.  It reframed the 'statutory off-ramp' as a downstream merits question, which is a standard and often successful tactic to keep the Court focused on the question presented.\n3.  It diminished the ripeness concern by highlighting the four years of FCC inaction, casting it as speculative.\n\nThe central question remains whether the Court will take the 'statutory off-ramp' to avoid the complex Hobbs Act issue. However, given that the Court has already granted certiorari on this exact question in *PDR Network* and the issue continues to cause confusion in the lower courts (as evidenced by the *Gorss Motels* concurrence), there is a strong impetus for the Court to provide a definitive answer. The petitioner has successfully argued this is a clean vehicle to do so.\n\nTherefore, I assess that a grant of certiorari is more likely than not.\n\nIf certiorari is granted, the prediction on the merits of the legal question is more straightforward. The question is: 'Does the Hobbs Act require a federal district court to accept the Federal Communication Commission\u2019s legal interpretation of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act?' The petitioner argues 'No.' This position aligns with Justice Kavanaugh's concurrence in *PDR Network* and the views of the four dissenters in that case. More broadly, it aligns with the current Court's clear trend of skepticism towards broad agency deference (e.g., the major questions doctrine, the pending reconsideration of *Chevron*). It is highly probable that a majority of the current Court would rule that the Hobbs Act does not strip a district court of its traditional authority to interpret a statute in an enforcement action.\n\nI have sufficient information from the primary source documents to make a high-confidence prediction. Further searching is unlikely to significantly alter this conclusion. I will now provide the final response.",

          "task_beliefs": "My understanding of the certiorari prospects for *McLaughlin v. McKesson* has now completed a full dialectical cycle, moving from the petitioner's initial framing, to the respondent's powerful counter-narrative, and now to the petitioner's rebuttal. The case appears more competitive for a grant of certiorari than it did after reading the Brief in Opposition, though significant hurdles remain.\n\n1.  **Petitioner's Core Argument:** This remains stable. The petitioner argues that the Hobbs Act does not compel a district court to accept an FCC legal interpretation as binding in a private TCPA enforcement action, and that the court should be free to interpret the TCPA for itself.\n\n2.  **The Centrality of *PDR Network*:** This case is still the undisputed sequel to *PDR Network*. The central debate, now fully fleshed out by all three briefs, is whether this case is a \"clean vehicle\" to resolve the question left open in *PDR Network* or a \"flawed vehicle\" with its own unique problems.\n\n3.  **The \"Vehicle\" Debate (Now a Three-Way Conversation):** My understanding of the case's fitness for review has become highly nuanced, incorporating the petitioner's direct rebuttals to the respondent's \"vehicle-dirtying\" arguments.\n    *   **Alternative Ground / \"Statutory Off-Ramp\":**\n        *   **Respondent's Argument (Stable):** The Court can affirm on the simple statutory ground that online fax services are not \"telephone facsimile machines\" under the TCPA, thus avoiding the complex Hobbs Act question entirely.\n        *   **Petitioner's Rebuttal (New Information):** The petitioner's Reply Brief argues this is a merits question for a lower court to decide *on remand*. They contend the question presented is *whether the court is allowed to conduct that analysis at all*, not what the outcome of that analysis should be. This is a direct attempt to re-focus the Court on the jurisdictional issue and frame the statutory argument as an irrelevant distraction at the cert stage. This rebuttal is standard but its effectiveness is uncertain, as the Court often takes plausible \"off-ramps.\"\n    *   **Prudential Ripeness Concern:**\n        *   **Respondent's Argument (Stable):** The Court should not intervene while a review application concerning the *Amerifactors* order is pending before the full FCC.\n        *   **Petitioner's Rebuttal (New Information):** The petitioner dismisses this as \"speculation,\" noting the application has been pending for four years with no action. They argue the mere \"theoretical possibility\" of future agency action is not a valid reason for the Court to decline review of a live controversy. This rebuttal effectively weakens the ripeness objection by framing it as a delay tactic.\n    *   **Illusory Circuit Split:**\n        *   **Respondent's Argument (Stable):** The cited cases in the split are factually and legally distinguishable.\n        *   **Petitioner's Rebuttal (New Information):** The petitioner insists the pre-*PDR Network* split is \"alive and well\" and that the need for resolution has only grown, citing a concurring opinion from the Eleventh Circuit in *Gorss Motels, Inc.* calling for en banc review. They argue the split is real and pressing.\n\n4.  **The \"Kavanaugh Concurrence\" Strategy (Re-energized):** The petitioner has mounted a significant counter-attack against the respondent's attempt to neutralize their appeal to the conservative justices.\n    *   **Respondent's Rebuttal (Stable):** The due process concerns of the *PDR Network* concurrence (authored by Justice Kavanaugh) don't apply here because the parties are inverted. A *plaintiff* (McLaughlin) is challenging an order that limits liability, whereas the concurrence was concerned about a *defendant* facing liability without being able to challenge the underlying rule.\n    *   **Petitioner's Counter-Rebuttal (New Information):** The petitioner argues forcefully that the Hobbs Act's meaning does not change depending on which party invokes it. They assert that Justice Kavanaugh's analysis was based on the statute's text and applies equally to plaintiffs and defendants. Crucially, they cite Judge Pryor's concurrence in *Gorss Motels* to support the idea that a plaintiff with a valid claim can be harmed by an agency misinterpretation, thus re-establishing a symmetrical due process concern. This appears to be a strong rebuttal that revives the original strategic appeal of the petition.\n\n5.  **Updated Prediction & Uncertainty:** After digesting the respondent's BIO, my confidence in a cert grant was very low. The Reply Brief has successfully rebutted several of the respondent's strongest points, particularly the argument about the inverted party posture. The case now appears to be a much closer call. The \"statutory off-ramp\" remains the most significant obstacle for the petitioner. The final decision will likely hinge on whether a majority of the Court views that off-ramp as a prudent reason to deny review or as a downstream merits question that shouldn't prevent them from finally resolving the important and recurring Hobbs Act issue they previously agreed to hear in *PDR Network*. My uncertainty has therefore increased, and I now see a plausible, albeit difficult, path to a cert grant.",
          "design_beliefs": "My meta-level framework has been further refined by observing the final stage of the certiorari briefing process. The importance of analyzing the full dialectical exchange is now paramount.\n\n1.  **Problem Decomposition Strategy:** Remains valid.\n2.  **Case Categorization Heuristic:** Still accurate. The case is about **Hobbs Act preclusion**, with the key sub-issues being **vehicle selection criteria** like alternative grounds for affirmance and prudential ripeness.\n3.  **Source Prioritization Heuristic (Refined):** The briefing sequence is a three-act play: **(1) Petition for Certiorari (The Pitch) \u2192 (2) Brief in Opposition (The Attack) \u2192 (3) Reply Brief (The Rebuttal)**. A complete analysis requires all three. Making a final prediction after the BIO is premature, as the Reply Brief is specifically designed to neutralize the BIO's most damaging arguments. The Reply is where the petitioner shows whether the \"vehicle problems\" are truly fatal or merely contested.\n4.  **Contextual Analysis Strategy:** Remains crucial. The petitioner's use of the *Gorss Motels* concurrence to bolster their own argument shows how savvy litigants use recent, related judicial opinions to support their positions and demonstrate the ongoing importance of a legal question.\n5.  **Precedent-Chaining Strategy:** Remains essential. The key analytical task is confirmed to be modeling the debate over whether this case is a *better* or *worse* vehicle than *PDR Network*. The Reply Brief shows how a petitioner can spin a distinction (like not arguing a lack of prior review) as a feature that makes the vehicle *cleaner*.\n6.  **\"Vehicle\" Analysis Heuristic (Enhanced):** My model of this process is now more complete. I have a checklist for \"dirtying\" tactics (from the BIO) and now a corresponding checklist for **\"re-polishing\" tactics** (from the Reply Brief):\n    *   **Re-framing:** Casting a fatal flaw (like an alternative statutory ground) as a simple merits question for remand.\n    *   **Minimizing:** Portraying a contingency (like pending agency action) as purely \"speculative\" and not a concrete bar to review.\n    *   **Arguing for Symmetry:** Neutralizing a postural distinction (plaintiff vs. defendant) by appealing to the text of the statute and broader legal principles.\n    *   **Strategic Re-characterization:** Spinning a factual difference from a key precedent as a positive that makes the current case a *better* vehicle.\n7.  **Justice-Specific Argument Tracking:** This remains critical. The petitioner's defense of their Kavanaugh-centric strategy demonstrates that the analysis must not only identify the initial targeting but also model the subsequent defense of that targeting against counter-arguments.\n8.  **Adversarial Analysis & Uncertainty Reduction:** This principle is strongly reinforced. The process is inherently adversarial. My belief state should reflect the back-and-forth. High confidence after reading one brief is a sign of incomplete analysis. True confidence (or well-understood uncertainty) comes from seeing how one side's strongest arguments hold up under direct attack from the other.\n9.  **Statutory Off-Ramp Analysis (Refined):** This heuristic is confirmed as a major factor in cert denials. I have now observed the standard counter-move: labeling the off-ramp a \"merits question for remand.\" My predictive task now involves assessing the Court's likely appetite for the larger, more complex question versus the simpler, case-dispositive off-ramp. This is a context-dependent judgment call, not a mechanical rule."

The court should have the authority to interpret the statute itself.\n\n2.  **The Centrality of *PDR Network* (Stable):** The case is fundamentally a sequel to *PDR Network*, with the entire cert-stage debate revolving around whether this case presents a clean opportunity to resolve the question left open by that case's dismissal.\n\n3.  **The \"Vehicle\" Debate (Resolved):** The three-part briefing cycle has fully illuminated and, from a predictive standpoint, resolved the debate over the case's fitness for review.\n    *   **Alternative Ground / \"Statutory Off-Ramp\":** The respondent's argument that the Court could simply rule that online faxes are not \"telephone facsimile machines\" remains the single most significant obstacle to a cert grant. However, the petitioner's rebuttal\u2014framing this as a merits question for remand\u2014is a standard and often effective counter-maneuver. The Court's decision on this point will reveal its appetite for resolving the larger Hobbs Act question.\n    *   **Prudential Ripeness Concern:** The petitioner's Reply Brief effectively neutralized this concern by highlighting the four years of FCC inaction on the related *Amerifactors* order, successfully portraying the respondent's argument as a call for indefinite delay based on speculation.\n    *   **Illusory Circuit Split:** The petitioner's insistence that the split is real and pressing, bolstered by citing the *Gorss Motels* concurrence, appears sufficient to meet the threshold for demonstrating ongoing confusion in the lower courts.\n\n4.  **The \"Kavanaugh Concurrence\" Strategy (Vindicated):** The petitioner's strategy of appealing to the conservative justices, particularly through Justice Kavanaugh's *PDR Network* concurrence, has survived the respondent's counter-attack. The petitioner's argument in the Reply Brief\u2014that the Hobbs Act's meaning is symmetrical and does not depend on whether a plaintiff or defendant invokes it\u2014is textually and logically strong, successfully reviving the due process concerns that animate the concurrence.\n\n5.  **Final Prediction & Synthesis (New):** Having analyzed the complete briefing, I have moved from a state of uncertainty to a final, synthesized prediction.\n    *   **Certiorari Prediction:** A grant of certiorari is **more likely than not**. While the \"statutory off-ramp\" presents a plausible reason for denial, the combination of a persistent circuit split, the Court's prior interest in the exact same question (*PDR Network*), and the petitioner's successful rebuttal of the other vehicle defects creates a strong impetus for the Court to grant review and provide a definitive answer.\n    *   **Conditional Merits Prediction:** **If certiorari is granted, the Court will likely reverse the Ninth Circuit.** The legal question\u2014whether the Hobbs Act requires deference to the FCC's interpretation\u2014is highly likely to be answered \"No.\" This outcome aligns with the reasoning of Justice Kavanaugh's concurrence and the four dissenters in *PDR Network*, and more broadly with the current Court's well-established skepticism toward doctrines of broad agency deference (as seen in its development of the major questions doctrine and its pending reconsideration of *Chevron*).",
          "design_beliefs": "My meta-level framework has evolved to incorporate the final, synthesizing stage of the predictive process, moving from information gathering to conclusion formation.\n\n1.  **Problem Decomposition Strategy:** Remains valid.\n2.  **Case Categorization Heuristic:** Still accurate. The case is confirmed as a **Hobbs Act preclusion** matter, with the key variables being **vehicle selection criteria**.\n3.  **Source Prioritization Heuristic (Confirmed):** The \"three-act play\" model of cert briefing (Petition -> BIO -> Reply) is confirmed as the essential analytical path. The final synthesis demonstrates that a reliable prediction is only possible after observing the petitioner's rebuttal in the Reply Brief.\n4.  **Contextual Analysis Strategy:** Remains crucial. The final merits prediction relies heavily on this strategy, connecting the specific Hobbs Act question to the Court's broader jurisprudential trends in administrative law.\n5.  **Precedent-Chaining Strategy:** Remains essential. The entire analysis hinges on the relationship between this case and *PDR Network*.\n6.  **\"Vehicle\" Analysis Heuristic (Complete):** My model now covers the full lifecycle of a vehicle's evaluation at the cert stage: the initial pitch (Petition), the \"dirtying\" tactics (BIO), and the \"re-polishing\" tactics (Reply).\n7.  **Justice-Specific Argument Tracking:** Remains critical. The successful defense of the Kavanaugh-centric strategy underscores the importance of modeling not just the initial targeting of a justice's known views, but the full adversarial exchange around that targeting.\n8.  **Adversarial Analysis & Uncertainty Reduction:** This principle is strongly reinforced. The entire process has been an exercise in tracking how arguments hold up under attack, with my uncertainty systematically decreasing as each stage of the dialectic was revealed.\n9.  **Statutory Off-Ramp Analysis:** This is confirmed as a primary heuristic for predicting cert denials. My model now includes the standard petitioner counter-move (\"it's a merits question for remand\") and recognizes that the final judgment involves weighing the Court's interest in the \"off-ramp\" versus the main legal question.\n10. **Informational Sufficiency Principle (New):** A key meta-cognitive insight is recognizing the point of diminishing returns in information gathering. After analyzing the complete primary source record of cert-stage briefing, a state of \"informational sufficiency\" was reached, allowing for a high-confidence prediction without needing to search for further, lower-value information (e.g., blog commentary, amicus briefs at the cert stage). The DBOED process should aim to reach this state efficiently.\n11. **Conditional Prediction Strategy (New):** For tasks with multiple, sequential decision points (e.g., cert grant, then merits ruling), an effective output strategy is to offer a conditional prediction. This provides a more comprehensive answer by forecasting the outcome of the second stage contingent on the outcome of the first. This structures the analysis and clarifies the different probabilities at each step."
