      "Does a plaintiff who belongs to a majority group need to demonstrate \u201cbackground circumstances suggesting that the defendant is the unusual employer who discriminates against the majority\u201d in order to establish a prima facie case of discrimination under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964?"

    "facts_of_the_case": "The Ohio Department of Youth Services hired Marlean Ames, a heterosexual woman, in 2004 and promoted her to Administrator of the Prison Rape Elimination Act (PREA) in 2014. In 2017, Ames was assigned a new supervisor, Ginine Trim, who is gay. Trim reported to Assistant Director Julie Walburn, and in 2019, Ryan Gies was appointed as the Department's Director. Both Walburn and Gies are heterosexual. In December 2018, Trim gave Ames a generally positive performance evaluation.\n\nIn April 2019, Ames applied for the position of Bureau Chief of Quality but was not selected. Shortly after, Trim suggested that Ames consider retirement. On May 10, 2019, Ames was demoted from her PREA Administrator position, resulting in a significant pay cut. The Department then promoted Alexander Stojsavljevic, a 25-year-old gay man, to the PREA Administrator position. Later that year, Yolanda Frierson, a gay woman, was chosen as Bureau Chief of Quality. Following these events, Ames filed a discrimination charge with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and then sued the Department under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, asserting claims of discrimination based on sexual orientation and sex. The district court granted summary judgment to the Department, holding that Ames lacked evidence of \u201cbackground circumstances\u201d necessary to establishing her prima facie case for her claim based on sexual orientation, and that Ames lacked evidence of pretext for purposes of her sex-discrimination claim. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed.",

The central legal question is whether a plaintiff from a majority group must show 'background circumstances' to establish a prima facie case of discrimination under Title VII. This is a question about the proper application of the McDonnell Douglas framework in 'reverse discrimination' cases. My initial uncertainty is high for both the specific case parameters (\u03b8) and general prediction strategies (D).\n\nTo reduce uncertainty in \u03b8, I need to understand the specific arguments being made by the petitioner (Ames) and the respondent (Ohio). What precedents are they relying on? How do they frame the issue? The best source for this initial information is the petition for a writ of certiorari, which lays out the petitioner's core argument for why the Supreme Court should hear the case, focusing on the circuit split and the alleged error of the lower court.\n\nTo reduce uncertainty in D, I need to understand how the current Supreme Court approaches Title VII, statutory interpretation (especially textualism vs. purposivism), and judge-made frameworks like McDonnell Douglas. I also need to know if there are general patterns, like the influence of the Solicitor General's opinion or the formation of specific voting blocs in employment law cases.\n\nMy first step should be to get the foundational document that frames the petitioner's argument.

This moves the agent from a state of total ambiguity to having a concrete, high-yield investigative plan. This structuring is a crucial first step in building an understanding of the task parameters (\u03b8).\n\nDesign EIG (0.3): The reasoning articulates a foundational design principle: 'start with the petitioner's core framing document.' By identifying this as the optimal first step, the agent is beginning to build its model of an effective prediction strategy (D). While not a novel discovery, formalizing this as the initial step in the design process has tangible value.\n\nThe action's primary contribution is creating a high-quality experimental design (i.e., planning to query the most relevant document first), which dramatically increases the expected information gain of the subsequent action.",

This will massively reduce uncertainty about the specific legal battleground.

The district \ncourt\u2019s order on Respondent\u2019s motion for summary \njudgment is unpublished and is reproduced at App. 13a\u2013\n40a.    The district court\u2019s order on Respondent\u2019s motion \nfor judgment on the pleadings is unpublished and is \nreproduced at App. 42a\u201357a.   \n \nJURISDICTION \nThe Sixth Circuit issued its opinion on December 4, \n2023.  This Court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1254(1).  On February 26, 2024, Justice Kavanaugh \ngranted Petitioner\u2019s application for extension of time to \nfile a petition for writ of certiorari, from March 3 to March \n18, 2024.   \n \nSTATUTORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(a)(1) provides:   \n \nIt shall be an unlawful employment practice \nfor an employer to fail or refuse to hire or to \n\n2 \n \n \ndischarge any individual, or otherwise to \ndiscriminate against any individual with \nrespect \nto \nhis \ncompensation, \nterms, \nconditions, or privileges of employment, \nbecause of such individual\u2019s race, color, \nreligion, sex, or national origin.  \n \nINTRODUCTION \nTitle VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 bars \nemployers from \u201cdiscriminat[ing] against any individual . \n. . because of such individual\u2019s race, color, religion, sex, or \nnational origin.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(a)(1).  Though this \nlanguage is unequivocal\u2014prohibiting discrimination \nagainst \nany \nindividual \nbased \non \na \nprotected \ncharacteristic\u2014five courts of appeals require majority-\ngroup plaintiffs, in addition to the other elements of Title \nVII, to also prove \u201cbackground circumstances to support \nthe suspicion that the defendant is that unusual employer \nwho discriminates against the majority.\u201d  App. 5a.  And as \nJudge Kethledge observed in his concurring opinion, \n\u201capplication of the \u2018background circumstances\u2019 rule alone\u201d \nprevented Marlean Ames from obtaining \u201ca jury trial\u201d on \nher claim of sexual orientation discrimination.  App. 10a \n(Kethledge, J., concurring). \nAmes is a heterosexual woman.  App. 5a.  She has \nworked at the Ohio Department of Youth Services since \n2004, beginning as an Executive Secretary before earning \nseveral promotions and eventually becoming a Program \nAdministrator.  App. 16a\u201317a.  In 2017, she started \nreporting to Ginine Trim, a gay woman.  App. 3a.  In 2019, \nAmes applied for a promotion to Bureau Chief.  App. 4a.  \nShe did not receive that promotion.  Instead, the \n\n3 \n \n \nDepartment offered it to a gay woman who (1) started \nafter Ames, (2) did not originally apply for the promotion, \nand (3) \u201clacked the minimum qualifications\u201d for the job, \nthus requiring the Department to \u201ccircumvent[] its own \ninternal procedures\u201d to hire her.  App. 20a\u201321a, App. 10a \n(Kethledge, J., concurring).  Shortly thereafter, the \nDepartment removed Ames from her position as Program \nAdministrator, giving her the choice between a demotion \nor termination.  App. 4a, App. 44a.  In her place, the \nDepartment hired a gay man as the new Program \nAdministrator, despite that individual, like the woman \nwho had obtained the Bureau Chief position over Ames, \nalso \u201cbeing neither qualified nor having formally applied\u201d \nfor the role.  App. 44a.   \nAs the Sixth Circuit observed, under McDonnell \nDouglas\u2019s burden shifting framework, \u201cAmes\u2019s prima-\nfacie case\u201d of sexual orientation discrimination should \nhave been \u201ceasy to make.\u201d   App. 5a.  \u201c[H]er claim is based \non sexual orientation, which is a protected ground under \nTitle VII, she was demoted from her position [that she \nhad] held . . . for five years, with reasonably good reviews; \nand she was replaced by a gay man.  Moreover, for the \nBureau Chief promotion that Ames was denied, the \nDepartment chose a gay woman.\u201d  Id. (citing Bostock v. \nClayton Cnty., Ga., 590 U.S. 644, 651\u201352 (2020)). \nBut such facts were insufficient here for Ames to \nsurvive summary judgment.  That is because, in the Sixth \nCircuit, a majority-group plaintiff like Ames\u2014i.e., a \nheterosexual \nwoman \nalleging \nsexual \norientation \ndiscrimination\u2014must, on top of Title VII\u2019s other \nrequirements, also show background circumstances.  Id.  \nAmes could do so by proving that a \u201cmember of the \nrelevant minority group (here, gay people) made the \n\n4 \n \n \nemployment decision at issue\u201d or by marshaling \n\u201cstatistical evidence showing a pattern of discrimination \nby the employer against members of the majority group.\u201d  \nApp. 5a\u20136a.  A minority-group plaintiff shoulders no such \nburden.  And significantly, because of circuit precedent, \nAmes could not satisfy background circumstances by \nreferring to her own failure to secure a promotion in favor \nof a gay woman.  Nor could she point to her demotion in \nfavor of a gay man, since a majority-group \u201cplaintiff \ncannot point to her own experience to establish a pattern \nof discrimination.\u201d  App. 6a (citing Sutherland v. Mich. \nDep\u2019t of Treasury, 344 F.3d 603, 615 (6th Cir. 2003)).   \nAs Judge Kethledge outlined, the Sixth Circuit is not \nalone in imposing this additional element.  The D.C., \nSeventh, Eighth, and Tenth Circuits also require \nmajority-group \nplaintiffs \nto \nshow \nbackground \ncircumstances.  App. 10a (Kethledge, J., concurring).  Two \ncircuits\u2014the Third and Eleventh\u2014\u201chave expressly \nrejected this rule.\u201d  Id.  And five circuits \u201csimply do not \napply it.\u201d  Id.  Within this third group, the First and Fifth \nCircuits \nhave \nemployed \nlanguage \nthat \nconveys \ndisapproval of the rule without explicitly rejecting it.  The \nSecond, Fourth, and Ninth Circuits, meanwhile, have \neach acknowledged the existence of the split but declined \nto take a side.  That tack has left district courts in these \ncircuits in disarray, with some judges in the same \ncourthouse requiring background circumstances and \nothers declining to do so.     \nIn short, \u201cnearly every circuit has addressed this issue \none way or another.\u201d  App. 11a.  And just like the Sixth \nCircuit here, half a dozen other courts of appeals have \nacknowledged a \u201csplit\u201d on the issue.  See, e.g., Iadimarco \nv. Runyon, 190 F.3d 151, 155 (3d Cir. 1999); Zottola v. City \n\n5 \n \n \nof Oakland, 32 F. App\u2019x 307, 310 (9th Cir. 2002) (\u201cThere is \ncurrently a circuit split on this issue.\u201d); see also Smith v. \nLockheed-Martin Corp., 644 F.3d 1321, 1325 n.15 (11th \nCir. 2011); Aulicino v. N.Y.C. Dep\u2019t of Homeless Servs., \n580 F.3d 73, 81 n.5 (2d Cir. 2009); Weeks v. Union Camp \nCorp., 215 F.3d 1323, *6 n.13 (4th Cir. 2000) (Table); \nHague v. Thompson Distrib. Co., 436 F.3d 816, 821\u201322 \n(7th Cir. 2006).  District courts have, in like manner, \nrecognized this \u201ccircuit split\u201d and described it as \n\u201cwidespread,\u201d McNaught v. Va. Comm. Coll. Sys., 933 F. \nSupp. 2d 804, 818 (E.D. Va. 2013), and \u201centrenched,\u201d \nNewman v. Howard Univ. Sch. of L., 2024 WL 450245, at \n*10 n.5 (D.D.C. Feb. 6, 2024).  \nFinally, because a background circumstances rule \nimposes \u201cburdens on different plaintiffs based on their \nmembership in different demographic groups,\u201d it is, as \nJudge Kethledge observed, \u201cnot a gloss upon the 1964 \nAct, but a deep scratch across its surface.\u201d  App. 9a\u201310a \n(emphasis in original).  After all, as the Court has \n\u201cstressed over and over again,\u201d interpretation of Title VII \n\u201cmust begin with, and ultimately heed, what [the] statute \nactually says.\u201d  Groff v. DeJoy, 600 U.S. 447, 468 (2023) \n(internal quotation marks and alterations omitted); \nBostock, 590 U.S. at 655\u201356.  Yet for decades, five circuits \nhave failed to do just that.  With background \ncircumstances proving dispositive for Ames, this case is \nan ideal opportunity for the Court to examine the rule and \nhold that it conflicts with Title VII\u2019s text and purpose. \n \n\n6 \n \n \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nA. Legal framework. \nA Title VII plaintiff may prove their \u201ccase by direct or \ncircumstantial evidence.\u201d  U.S. Postal Serv. Bd. of \nGovernors v. Aikens, 460 U.S. 711, 714 n.3 (1983).  But \nbecause \u201c[t]here will seldom be \u2018eyewitness\u2019 testimony as \nto the employer\u2019s mental processes,\u201d id. at 716, \nMcDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792 (1973), \noutlined a burden-shifting framework for analyzing \ndiscrimination claims based on the circumstantial \nevidence presented by the plaintiff in that case.   \nFirst, the plaintiff \u201cmust carry the initial burden . . . of \nestablishing a prima facie case of racial discrimination.\u201d  \nId. at 802.  \u201cThis may be done by showing (i) that he \nbelongs to a racial minority; (ii) that he applied and was \nqualified for a job for which the employer was seeking \napplicants; (iii) that, despite his qualifications, he was \nrejected; and (iv) that, after his rejection, the position \nremained open and the employer continued to seek \napplicants from persons of complainant\u2019s qualifications.\u201d  \nId.  If that prima facie case is met, the burden \u201cshift[s] to \nthe \nemployer \nto \narticulate \nsome \nlegitimate, \nnondiscriminatory reason for the employee\u2019s rejection.\u201d  \nId.  Finally, the burden returns to the plaintiff to show \nthat the employer\u2019s \u201cstated reason\u201d for its employment \naction \u201cwas in fact pretext.\u201d  Id. at 804. \n\n7 \n \n \nB. Factual background.1 \nThe \nOhio \nDepartment \nof \nYouth \nServices \n(\u201cDepartment\u201d) is \u201ca state agency that oversees juvenile \ncorrections, parole, and the rehabilitation of youth \nthrough community programs.\u201d  App. 14a.  Marlean Ames \nhas worked at the Department since 2004, when she was \nhired as an Executive Secretary.  App 16a.  She was \npromoted in 2009 to Community Facility Liaison.  Id.  \nBetween 2011 and 2013, Ames\u2019s supervisor \u201csigned off on \nstrong reviews of her performance each year.\u201d  App. 22a.  \nIn 2014, the Department promoted Ames to Program \nAdministrator for the Prison Rape Elimination Act \n(\u201cPREA\u201d).  App. 3a, App. 17a.  \nIn 2017, Ames began reporting to Ginine Trim, a gay \nwoman.  App. 3a.  In Ames\u2019s 2018 review, Trim wrote that \nAmes had \u201cmet \u2018expectations\u2019 in ten competencies and \nexceeded them in one.\u201d  Id.  Ames\u2019s evaluation did note \nthat she \u201cneeded to improve her management of PREA \ngrant funds.\u201d  App. 22a.  But overall, she received \n\u201creasonably good reviews\u201d for her performance.  App. 5a. \nIn April 2019, Ames applied to be the Department\u2019s \nBureau \nChief \nof \nQuality \nAssurance \nand \nImprovement.  She interviewed for the position with Trim \nand Julie Walburn, then-Assistant Director of the \nDepartment.  App. 19a.  Although Ames believed she had \nreceived \u201cpositive feedback\u201d during the interview, she \nwas not ultimately offered the role.  Id.   Instead, the \nposition went unfilled for several months before \u201cTrim \n \n1 Because this matter arises in a summary judgment posture, the \nfacts are viewed in the light most favorable to Ames, with reasonable \ninferences drawn in her favor.  Tolan v. Cotton, 572 U.S. 650, 651 \n(2014) (citing Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 255 \n(1986)).   \n\n8 \n \n \noffered the Bureau Chief position\u201d on a temporary (and, \neventually, permanent) basis to Yolanda Frierson, a gay \nwoman.  App. 20a.  Frierson had joined the Department \ntwo years after Ames.  App. 21a.  Unlike Ames, who was \n\u201cqualified and fulfill[ed] the application requirements,\u201d \nApp. 44a, Frierson \u201clacked the minimum qualifications for \nthe job\u201d and did not apply for the position when it was \noriginally \nposted, \nApp. \n10a \n(Kethledge, \nJ., \nconcurring).  Thus, to promote Frierson to Bureau Chief, \n\u201cthe \nDepartment \ncircumvented \nits \nown \ninternal \nprocedures.\u201d  Id.   \nYet Ames was not just passed over for Bureau Chief.  \nOn May 10, 2019, Walburn and Robin Gee, a member of \nthe Department\u2019s HR team, informed Ames that she was \nbeing removed from her position as PREA Administrator.  \nApp. 4a.  Ames was given the choice of returning to one of \nher previous roles, \u201cwhich would amount to a demotion,\u201d \nor being terminated from the Department.  App. 4a, App. \n44a.  She chose the former and, as a result, her wages \nnearly halved, from $47.22 per hour to $28.40.  App. 4a.    \nIn Ames\u2019s place, the Department selected Alexander \nStojsavljevic, \na \ngay \nman, \nas \nthe \nnew \nPREA \nAdministrator.  Id.  Stojsavljevic had joined the \nDepartment in May 2017 as a social worker.  App. 43a.  In \nOctober of that year, he was promoted to PREA \nCompliance Manager. Ames testified that such a \npromotion would have normally \u201cviolated the agency\u2019s \nhiring \nprocesses\u201d \non \npromoting \nemployees \non \nprobationary status.  Id.  To circumvent that rule, \nStojsavljevic\u2019s superintendent \u201capparently devised a \nwork-around.\u201d  App. 24a.  According to Ames, \nStojsavljevic\u2019s supervisor \u201casked Stojsavljevic to resign \nfrom his job and then hired him in the new role the next \nday.\u201d  Id.  That \u201cwork-around\u201d allowed the Department to \n\n9 \n \n \nmake Stojsavljevic a Compliance Manager despite him \nnot being \u201celigible for the promotion.\u201d  Id.   \nAfter becoming Compliance Manager, Stojsavljevic \nexpressed to Ames an \u201cimpatient attitude towards \nclimbing the ranks within the Department,\u201d \u201cclaim[ed] \nthat he could manipulate people to get what he wanted on \nthe basis of being a gay man,\u201d and \u201cacknowledge[d]\u201d that \nhe had \u201cbeen angling for Ames\u2019s position for some time, \nstating in front of their coworkers that he wanted the \nPREA Administrator position.\u201d App. 23a; accord App. \n43a.  Ames further alleged that Stojsavljevic \u201ctold Trim\u2014\nin front of [Ames]\u2014that [Ames] should retire.\u201d  App. 43a.  \nMuch like Frierson with the Bureau Chief role, the \nDepartment \nappointed \nStojsavljevic \nto \nPREA \nAdministrator \u201c[d]espite [him] being neither qualified nor \nhaving formally applied\u201d for the role.  App. 44a.   \nAmes remains at the Department today; she has, \nfollowing her 2019 demotion, since been promoted to \nHuman Services Program Administrator.  App. 18a. \nC. Proceedings below. \nOn August 21, 2019, Ames filed a charge of \ndiscrimination against the Department with the Ohio Civil \nRights \nCommission \nand \nthe \nEqual Employment \nOpportunity \nCommission \n(\u201cEEOC\u201d). \n \nApp. \n25a.  \nFollowing an investigation, the EEOC reached a \ndetermination of reasonable cause and, on September 20, \n2020, issued to Ames a right to sue letter.  Id.  On \nNovember 18, 2020, Ames filed suit in the Southern \nDistrict of Ohio.  Id.  Her complaint asserted causes of \naction under Title VII, the Fourteenth Amendment, the \nAge Discrimination in Employment Act (\u201cADEA\u201d), and \nstate law.  Id.  \n\n10 \n \n \nOn March 29, 2022, the district court dismissed Ames\u2019s \nFourteenth \nAmendment \nclaim, \nruling \nthat \nthe \nDepartment was not a \u201cperson\u201d for purposes of 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1983.  App. 50a.  It also dismissed Ames\u2019s ADEA and \nstate law claims, reasoning that, because the State of Ohio \nhad not \u201cwaived its immunity,\u201d the court lacked subject-\nmatter jurisdiction.  App. 47a\u201349a.  Finally, Ames\u2019s \ncomplaint alleged three Title VII violations, for (1) sex \nand sexual orientation discrimination, (2) hostile work \nenvironment, and (3) retaliation.  App. 25a.  The district \ncourt dismissed the hostile work environment and \nretaliation claims for failure to state a claim.  App. 53a, \nApp. 57a.  The Department did not move to dismiss, and \nthe district court did not address, Ames\u2019s claim of sex and \nsexual orientation discrimination. \nAfter discovery, the Department moved for summary \njudgment on Ames\u2019s remaining claim for sex and sexual \norientation discrimination.  App. 26a.  As to sex \ndiscrimination, Ames asserted that the Department \ndiscriminated against her on account of her sex because \n\u201cshe was demoted and replaced [as PREA Administrator] \nby Stojsavljevic,\u201d  a man.  App. 34a.  On sexual orientation \ndiscrimination, Ames pointed to the fact that she was \ndenied a promotion to Bureau Chief in favor of a gay \nwoman and later removed from her position as PREA \nAdministrator in favor of a gay man.  App. 30a\u201334a. \nOn her sex discrimination charge, the district court, \napplying the traditional McDonnell Douglas framework, \nheld that Ames could \u201ccarry her burden of establishing a \nprima facie claim.\u201d  App. 34a.  She was \u201ca member \n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

The district \ncourt\u2019s order on Respondent\u2019s motion for summary \njudgment is unpublished and is reproduced at App. 13a\u2013\n40a.    The district court\u2019s order on Respondent\u2019s motion \nfor judgment on the pleadings is unpublished and is \nreproduced at App. 42a\u201357a.   \n \nJURISDICTION \nThe Sixth Circuit issued its opinion on December 4, \n2023.  This Court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1254(1).  On February 26, 2024, Justice Kavanaugh \ngranted Petitioner\u2019s application for extension of time to \nfile a petition for writ of certiorari, from March 3 to March \n18, 2024.   \n \nSTATUTORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(a)(1) provides:   \n \nIt shall be an unlawful employment practice \nfor an employer to fail or refuse to hire or to \n\n2 \n \n \ndischarge any individual, or otherwise to \ndiscriminate against any individual with \nrespect \nto \nhis \ncompensation, \nterms, \nconditions, or privileges of employment, \nbecause of such individual\u2019s race, color, \nreligion, sex, or national origin.  \n \nINTRODUCTION \nTitle VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 bars \nemployers from \u201cdiscriminat[ing] against any individual . \n. . because of such individual\u2019s race, color, religion, sex, or \nnational origin.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(a)(1).  Though this \nlanguage is unequivocal\u2014prohibiting discrimination \nagainst \nany \nindividual \nbased \non \na \nprotected \ncharacteristic\u2014five courts of appeals require majority-\ngroup plaintiffs, in addition to the other elements of Title \nVII, to also prove \u201cbackground circumstances to support \nthe suspicion that the defendant is that unusual employer \nwho discriminates against the majority.\u201d  App. 5a.  And as \nJudge Kethledge observed in his concurring opinion, \n\u201capplication of the \u2018background circumstances\u2019 rule alone\u201d \nprevented Marlean Ames from obtaining \u201ca jury trial\u201d on \nher claim of sexual orientation discrimination.  App. 10a \n(Kethledge, J., concurring). \nAmes is a heterosexual woman.  App. 5a.  She has \nworked at the Ohio Department of Youth Services since \n2004, beginning as an Executive Secretary before earning \nseveral promotions and eventually becoming a Program \nAdministrator.  App. 16a\u201317a.  In 2017, she started \nreporting to Ginine Trim, a gay woman.  App. 3a.  In 2019, \nAmes applied for a promotion to Bureau Chief.  App. 4a.  \nShe did not receive that promotion.  Instead, the \n\n3 \n \n \nDepartment offered it to a gay woman who (1) started \nafter Ames, (2) did not originally apply for the promotion, \nand (3) \u201clacked the minimum qualifications\u201d for the job, \nthus requiring the Department to \u201ccircumvent[] its own \ninternal procedures\u201d to hire her.  App. 20a\u201321a, App. 10a \n(Kethledge, J., concurring).  Shortly thereafter, the \nDepartment removed Ames from her position as Program \nAdministrator, giving her the choice between a demotion \nor termination.  App. 4a, App. 44a.  In her place, the \nDepartment hired a gay man as the new Program \nAdministrator, despite that individual, like the woman \nwho had obtained the Bureau Chief position over Ames, \nalso \u201cbeing neither qualified nor having formally applied\u201d \nfor the role.  App. 44a.   \nAs the Sixth Circuit observed, under McDonnell \nDouglas\u2019s burden shifting framework, \u201cAmes\u2019s prima-\nfacie case\u201d of sexual orientation discrimination should \nhave been \u201ceasy to make.\u201d   App. 5a.  \u201c[H]er claim is based \non sexual orientation, which is a protected ground under \nTitle VII, she was demoted from her position [that she \nhad] held . . . for five years, with reasonably good reviews; \nand she was replaced by a gay man.  Moreover, for the \nBureau Chief promotion that Ames was denied, the \nDepartment chose a gay woman.\u201d  Id. (citing Bostock v. \nClayton Cnty., Ga., 590 U.S. 644, 651\u201352 (2020)). \nBut such facts were insufficient here for Ames to \nsurvive summary judgment.  That is because, in the Sixth \nCircuit, a majority-group plaintiff like Ames\u2014i.e., a \nheterosexual \nwoman \nalleging \nsexual \norientation \ndiscrimination\u2014must, on top of Title VII\u2019s other \nrequirements, also show background circumstances.  Id.  \nAmes could do so by proving that a \u201cmember of the \nrelevant minority group (here, gay people) made the \n\n4 \n \n \nemployment decision at issue\u201d or by marshaling \n\u201cstatistical evidence showing a pattern of discrimination \nby the employer against members of the majority group.\u201d  \nApp. 5a\u20136a.  A minority-group plaintiff shoulders no such \nburden.  And significantly, because of circuit precedent, \nAmes could not satisfy background circumstances by \nreferring to her own failure to secure a promotion in favor \nof a gay woman.  Nor could she point to her demotion in \nfavor of a gay man, since a majority-group \u201cplaintiff \ncannot point to her own experience to establish a pattern \nof discrimination.\u201d  App. 6a (citing Sutherland v. Mich. \nDep\u2019t of Treasury, 344 F.3d 603, 615 (6th Cir. 2003)).   \nAs Judge Kethledge outlined, the Sixth Circuit is not \nalone in imposing this additional element.  The D.C., \nSeventh, Eighth, and Tenth Circuits also require \nmajority-group \nplaintiffs \nto \nshow \nbackground \ncircumstances.  App. 10a (Kethledge, J., concurring).  Two \ncircuits\u2014the Third and Eleventh\u2014\u201chave expressly \nrejected this rule.\u201d  Id.  And five circuits \u201csimply do not \napply it.\u201d  Id.  Within this third group, the First and Fifth \nCircuits \nhave \nemployed \nlanguage \nthat \nconveys \ndisapproval of the rule without explicitly rejecting it.  The \nSecond, Fourth, and Ninth Circuits, meanwhile, have \neach acknowledged the existence of the split but declined \nto take a side.  That tack has left district courts in these \ncircuits in disarray, with some judges in the same \ncourthouse requiring background circumstances and \nothers declining to do so.     \nIn short, \u201cnearly every circuit has addressed this issue \none way or another.\u201d  App. 11a.  And just like the Sixth \nCircuit here, half a dozen other courts of appeals have \nacknowledged a \u201csplit\u201d on the issue.  See, e.g., Iadimarco \nv. Runyon, 190 F.3d 151, 155 (3d Cir. 1999); Zottola v. City \n\n5 \n \n \nof Oakland, 32 F. App\u2019x 307, 310 (9th Cir. 2002) (\u201cThere is \ncurrently a circuit split on this issue.\u201d); see also Smith v. \nLockheed-Martin Corp., 644 F.3d 1321, 1325 n.15 (11th \nCir. 2011); Aulicino v. N.Y.C. Dep\u2019t of Homeless Servs., \n580 F.3d 73, 81 n.5 (2d Cir. 2009); Weeks v. Union Camp \nCorp., 215 F.3d 1323, *6 n.13 (4th Cir. 2000) (Table); \nHague v. Thompson Distrib. Co., 436 F.3d 816, 821\u201322 \n(7th Cir. 2006).  District courts have, in like manner, \nrecognized this \u201ccircuit split\u201d and described it as \n\u201cwidespread,\u201d McNaught v. Va. Comm. Coll. Sys., 933 F. \nSupp. 2d 804, 818 (E.D. Va. 2013), and \u201centrenched,\u201d \nNewman v. Howard Univ. Sch. of L., 2024 WL 450245, at \n*10 n.5 (D.D.C. Feb. 6, 2024).  \nFinally, because a background circumstances rule \nimposes \u201cburdens on different plaintiffs based on their \nmembership in different demographic groups,\u201d it is, as \nJudge Kethledge observed, \u201cnot a gloss upon the 1964 \nAct, but a deep scratch across its surface.\u201d  App. 9a\u201310a \n(emphasis in original).  After all, as the Court has \n\u201cstressed over and over again,\u201d interpretation of Title VII \n\u201cmust begin with, and ultimately heed, what [the] statute \nactually says.\u201d  Groff v. DeJoy, 600 U.S. 447, 468 (2023) \n(internal quotation marks and alterations omitted); \nBostock, 590 U.S. at 655\u201356.  Yet for decades, five circuits \nhave failed to do just that.  With background \ncircumstances proving dispositive for Ames, this case is \nan ideal opportunity for the Court to examine the rule and \nhold that it conflicts with Title VII\u2019s text and purpose. \n \n\n6 \n \n \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nA. Legal framework. \nA Title VII plaintiff may prove their \u201ccase by direct or \ncircumstantial evidence.\u201d  U.S. Postal Serv. Bd. of \nGovernors v. Aikens, 460 U.S. 711, 714 n.3 (1983).  But \nbecause \u201c[t]here will seldom be \u2018eyewitness\u2019 testimony as \nto the employer\u2019s mental processes,\u201d id. at 716, \nMcDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792 (1973), \noutlined a burden-shifting framework for analyzing \ndiscrimination claims based on the circumstantial \nevidence presented by the plaintiff in that case.   \nFirst, the plaintiff \u201cmust carry the initial burden . . . of \nestablishing a prima facie case of racial discrimination.\u201d  \nId. at 802.  \u201cThis may be done by showing (i) that he \nbelongs to a racial minority; (ii) that he applied and was \nqualified for a job for which the employer was seeking \napplicants; (iii) that, despite his qualifications, he was \nrejected; and (iv) that, after his rejection, the position \nremained open and the employer continued to seek \napplicants from persons of complainant\u2019s qualifications.\u201d  \nId.  If that prima facie case is met, the burden \u201cshift[s] to \nthe \nemployer \nto \narticulate \nsome \nlegitimate, \nnondiscriminatory reason for the employee\u2019s rejection.\u201d  \nId.  Finally, the burden returns to the plaintiff to show \nthat the employer\u2019s \u201cstated reason\u201d for its employment \naction \u201cwas in fact pretext.\u201d  Id. at 804. \n\n7 \n \n \nB. Factual background.1 \nThe \nOhio \nDepartment \nof \nYouth \nServices \n(\u201cDepartment\u201d) is \u201ca state agency that oversees juvenile \ncorrections, parole, and the rehabilitation of youth \nthrough community programs.\u201d  App. 14a.  Marlean Ames \nhas worked at the Department since 2004, when she was \nhired as an Executive Secretary.  App 16a.  She was \npromoted in 2009 to Community Facility Liaison.  Id.  \nBetween 2011 and 2013, Ames\u2019s supervisor \u201csigned off on \nstrong reviews of her performance each year.\u201d  App. 22a.  \nIn 2014, the Department promoted Ames to Program \nAdministrator for the Prison Rape Elimination Act \n(\u201cPREA\u201d).  App. 3a, App. 17a.  \nIn 2017, Ames began reporting to Ginine Trim, a gay \nwoman.  App. 3a.  In Ames\u2019s 2018 review, Trim wrote that \nAmes had \u201cmet \u2018expectations\u2019 in ten competencies and \nexceeded them in one.\u201d  Id.  Ames\u2019s evaluation did note \nthat she \u201cneeded to improve her management of PREA \ngrant funds.\u201d  App. 22a.  But overall, she received \n\u201creasonably good reviews\u201d for her performance.  App. 5a. \nIn April 2019, Ames applied to be the Department\u2019s \nBureau \nChief \nof \nQuality \nAssurance \nand \nImprovement.  She interviewed for the position with Trim \nand Julie Walburn, then-Assistant Director of the \nDepartment.  App. 19a.  Although Ames believed she had \nreceived \u201cpositive feedback\u201d during the interview, she \nwas not ultimately offered the role.  Id.   Instead, the \nposition went unfilled for several months before \u201cTrim \n \n1 Because this matter arises in a summary judgment posture, the \nfacts are viewed in the light most favorable to Ames, with reasonable \ninferences drawn in her favor.  Tolan v. Cotton, 572 U.S. 650, 651 \n(2014) (citing Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 255 \n(1986)).   \n\n8 \n \n \noffered the Bureau Chief position\u201d on a temporary (and, \neventually, permanent) basis to Yolanda Frierson, a gay \nwoman.  App. 20a.  Frierson had joined the Department \ntwo years after Ames.  App. 21a.  Unlike Ames, who was \n\u201cqualified and fulfill[ed] the application requirements,\u201d \nApp. 44a, Frierson \u201clacked the minimum qualifications for \nthe job\u201d and did not apply for the position when it was \noriginally \nposted, \nApp. \n10a \n(Kethledge, \nJ., \nconcurring).  Thus, to promote Frierson to Bureau Chief, \n\u201cthe \nDepartment \ncircumvented \nits \nown \ninternal \nprocedures.\u201d  Id.   \nYet Ames was not just passed over for Bureau Chief.  \nOn May 10, 2019, Walburn and Robin Gee, a member of \nthe Department\u2019s HR team, informed Ames that she was \nbeing removed from her position as PREA Administrator.  \nApp. 4a.  Ames was given the choice of returning to one of \nher previous roles, \u201cwhich would amount to a demotion,\u201d \nor being terminated from the Department.  App. 4a, App. \n44a.  She chose the former and, as a result, her wages \nnearly halved, from $47.22 per hour to $28.40.  App. 4a.    \nIn Ames\u2019s place, the Department selected Alexander \nStojsavljevic, \na \ngay \nman, \nas \nthe \nnew \nPREA \nAdministrator.  Id.  Stojsavljevic had joined the \nDepartment in May 2017 as a social worker.  App. 43a.  In \nOctober of that year, he was promoted to PREA \nCompliance Manager. Ames testified that such a \npromotion would have normally \u201cviolated the agency\u2019s \nhiring \nprocesses\u201d \non \npromoting \nemployees \non \nprobationary status.  Id.  To circumvent that rule, \nStojsavljevic\u2019s superintendent \u201capparently devised a \nwork-around.\u201d  App. 24a.  According to Ames, \nStojsavljevic\u2019s supervisor \u201casked Stojsavljevic to resign \nfrom his job and then hired him in the new role the next \nday.\u201d  Id.  That \u201cwork-around\u201d allowed the Department to \n\n9 \n \n \nmake Stojsavljevic a Compliance Manager despite him \nnot being \u201celigible for the promotion.\u201d  Id.   \nAfter becoming Compliance Manager, Stojsavljevic \nexpressed to Ames an \u201cimpatient attitude towards \nclimbing the ranks within the Department,\u201d \u201cclaim[ed] \nthat he could manipulate people to get what he wanted on \nthe basis of being a gay man,\u201d and \u201cacknowledge[d]\u201d that \nhe had \u201cbeen angling for Ames\u2019s position for some time, \nstating in front of their coworkers that he wanted the \nPREA Administrator position.\u201d App. 23a; accord App. \n43a.  Ames further alleged that Stojsavljevic \u201ctold Trim\u2014\nin front of [Ames]\u2014that [Ames] should retire.\u201d  App. 43a.  \nMuch like Frierson with the Bureau Chief role, the \nDepartment \nappointed \nStojsavljevic \nto \nPREA \nAdministrator \u201c[d]espite [him] being neither qualified nor \nhaving formally applied\u201d for the role.  App. 44a.   \nAmes remains at the Department today; she has, \nfollowing her 2019 demotion, since been promoted to \nHuman Services Program Administrator.  App. 18a. \nC. Proceedings below. \nOn August 21, 2019, Ames filed a charge of \ndiscrimination against the Department with the Ohio Civil \nRights \nCommission \nand \nthe \nEqual Employment \nOpportunity \nCommission \n(\u201cEEOC\u201d). \n \nApp. \n25a.  \nFollowing an investigation, the EEOC reached a \ndetermination of reasonable cause and, on September 20, \n2020, issued to Ames a right to sue letter.  Id.  On \nNovember 18, 2020, Ames filed suit in the Southern \nDistrict of Ohio.  Id.  Her complaint asserted causes of \naction under Title VII, the Fourteenth Amendment, the \nAge Discrimination in Employment Act (\u201cADEA\u201d), and \nstate law.  Id.  \n\n10 \n \n \nOn March 29, 2022, the district court dismissed Ames\u2019s \nFourteenth \nAmendment \nclaim, \nruling \nthat \nthe \nDepartment was not a \u201cperson\u201d for purposes of 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1983.  App. 50a.  It also dismissed Ames\u2019s ADEA and \nstate law claims, reasoning that, because the State of Ohio \nhad not \u201cwaived its immunity,\u201d the court lacked subject-\nmatter jurisdiction.  App. 47a\u201349a.  Finally, Ames\u2019s \ncomplaint alleged three Title VII violations, for (1) sex \nand sexual orientation discrimination, (2) hostile work \nenvironment, and (3) retaliation.  App. 25a.  The district \ncourt dismissed the hostile work environment and \nretaliation claims for failure to state a claim.  App. 53a, \nApp. 57a.  The Department did not move to dismiss, and \nthe district court did not address, Ames\u2019s claim of sex and \nsexual orientation discrimination. \nAfter discovery, the Department moved for summary \njudgment on Ames\u2019s remaining claim for sex and sexual \norientation discrimination.  App. 26a.  As to sex \ndiscrimination, Ames asserted that the Department \ndiscriminated against her on account of her sex because \n\u201cshe was demoted and replaced [as PREA Administrator] \nby Stojsavljevic,\u201d  a man.  App. 34a.  On sexual orientation \ndiscrimination, Ames pointed to the fact that she was \ndenied a promotion to Bureau Chief in favor of a gay \nwoman and later removed from her position as PREA \nAdministrator in favor of a gay man.  App. 30a\u201334a. \nOn her sex discrimination charge, the district court, \napplying the traditional McDonnell Douglas framework, \nheld that Ames could \u201ccarry her burden of establishing a \nprima facie claim.\u201d  App. 34a.  She was \u201ca member of a \nprotected class (as a female), was qualified for her role as \nPREA Administrator, was terminated (i.e., an adverse \nemployment action), and was replaced by a male \nemployee.\u201d  App. 35a.  But the Department had also, from \n\n11 \n \n \nthe \ndistrict \ncourt\u2019s \nview, \noffered \n\u201clegitimate, \nnondiscriminatory business reasons\u201d behind its decision:  \ne.g., a \u201cdesire to revamp the Department\u2019s PREA \nstrategy\u201d and a concern over Ames\u2019s \u201cvision, ability, [and] \nleadership skills,\u201d which \u201cshift[ed]\u201d the \u201cburden of \nproduction\u201d back to Ames \u201cto show that [these] proffered \nreason[s] [were] pretextual.\u201d  App. 35a, 38a.  Upon \nconsidering the totality of the evidence, the district court \nconcluded that Ames had not cleared that bar.  App. 38a\u2013\n40a. \nAs \nto \nAmes\u2019s \nclaim \nof \nsexual \norientation \ndiscrimination, the court likewise stated that McDonnell \nDouglas governed.  App. 28a.  But because Ames is a \n\u201cmember of a majority group\u201d\u2014i.e., a heterosexual \nwoman\u2014she had to overcome the added obstacle of \n\u201cshow[ing] that \u2018background circumstances support the \nsuspicion that the defendant is that unusual employer who \ndiscriminates against the majority\u2019 to establish the first \nprong of the prima facie case.\u201d  Id. (quoting Parker v. \nBalt. & Ohio R.R. Co., 652 F.2d 1012, 1017 (D.C. Cir. \n1981)).  And although the Department had twice \npromoted a gay employee in a manner adverse to Ames, \nsuch evidence was insufficient because \u201ca plaintiff cannot \npoint to her own experience to establish a pattern of \ndiscrimination.\u201d  App. 6a.  Because Ames \u201cfailed to provide \n\u2018background circumstances,\u2019\u201d the district court granted \nsummary judgment to the Department on her sexual \norientation discrimination claim.  App. 39a\u201340a. \nAmes filed a notice of appeal on her sex and sexual \norientation discrimination claim to the Sixth Circuit.  On \nsex discrimination, the Sixth Circuit agreed with the \ndistrict court that Ames had failed to show that the \n\n12 \n \n \nDepartment\u2019s \n\u201cnondiscriminatory \nreasons \nfor \nher \ndemotion\u201d were \u201cpretext[ual].\u201d App. 6a\u20138a.2   \nOn sexual orientation discrimination, the Sixth \nCircuit, like the district court, recognized that the \n\u201cprincipal issue\u201d was whether Ames had \u201cmade the \nnecessary showing of \u2018background circumstances.\u2019\u201d  App. \n5a.  That is because, as the panel noted, Ames\u2019s case under \nMcDonnell \nDouglas \nwas \notherwise \n\u201ceasy \nto \nmake.\u201d  Id.  Ames was a member of a protected class, \nreceived \n\u201creasonably \ngood \nreviews\u201d \nas \nPREA \nAdministrator, was demoted in favor of a gay man, and \nwas denied a promotion to Bureau Chief in favor of a less-\nqualified gay woman.  Id.  \u201cWhere Ames founders, \nhowever, is on the requisite showing of \u2018background \ncircumstances.\u2019\u201d  Id.  As the Sixth Circuit noted, \n\u201c[p]laintiffs typically make that showing with evidence \nthat a member of the relevant minority group (here, gay \npeople) made the employment decision at issue, or with \nstatistical evidence showing a pattern of discrimination by \nthe employer against members of the majority group.\u201d  \nApp. 5a\u20136a.  Ames had checked neither box.  \nJudge Kethledge concurred.  Like the majority, he \nagreed that, but-for background circumstances, Ames\u2019s \nclaim of sexual orientation discrimination could have gone \nforward to a jury.  \u201c[N]obody,\u201d Judge Kethledge \nunderscored, \u201cdisputes that Ames has established the \nother elements of her prima-facie case\u201d:  After all, \u201ctwice \nin one year the Department promoted an arguably less-\n \n2 Ames did not raise her state law, ADEA, or Fourteenth \nAmendment claims before the Sixth Circuit.  Though she did seek \nreview before the Sixth Circuit of the district court\u2019s sex \ndiscrimination ruling, her petition here concerns only the court of \nappeals\u2019s decision on her allegations of sexual orientation \ndiscrimination. \n\n13 \n \n \nqualified gay employee in a manner adverse to Ames.\u201d  \nApp. 10a.  Judge Kethledge, though, wrote separately to \n\u201cexpress [his] disagreement\u201d with the background \ncircumstances rule.  App. 9a.  Though he acknowledged \nthat circuit precedent \u201cbound\u201d the court to apply the rule \nagainst Ames, he asserted that the Sixth Circuit and \nseveral other courts of appeals \u201chave lost their bearings \nin adopting this rule.\u201d  App. 9a, 11a.  Title VII, Judge \nKethledge explained, bars discrimination based on an \nindividual\u2019s \u201crace, color, religion, sex, or national origin.\u201d  \nApp. 9a (quoting 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(a)(1)).  \u201cThe \nstatute,\u201d he emphasized, \u201cexpressly extends its protection \nto \u2018any individual.\u2019\u201d  App. 10a.  Yet the Sixth Circuit\u2019s \napproach \u201ctreats some \u2018individuals\u2019 worse than others\u2014in \nother words, it discriminates\u2014on the very grounds that \nthe statute forbids.\u201d  Id.   \nJudge \nKethledge \ncharacterized \nbackground \ncircumstances not as \u201ca gloss upon the 1964 Act, but a \ndeep scratch against its surface.\u201d  Id.  He went on to \noutline a split in the courts of appeals, noting that \u201cfive \ncircuits (including our own) have adopted the \u2018background \ncircumstances\u2019 rule since the D.C. Circuit first adopted it \nin 1981.\u201d  Id.  Two circuits have \u201cexpressly rejected this \nrule,\u201d and five others \u201csimply do not apply it.\u201d  App. 10a\u2013\n11a.  In sum, \u201cnearly every circuit has addressed this issue \none way or another\u201d and, Judge Kethledge concluded, \n\u201c[p]erhaps the Supreme Court will soon do so as well.\u201d  \nApp. 11a. \n \n \n \n\n14 \n \n \nREASONS FOR GRANTING THE PETITION \nUnder Title VII, an employer may not \u201cdiscriminate \nagainst any individual with respect to his compensation, \nterms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of \nsuch individual\u2019s race, color, religion, sex, or national \norigin.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e\u20132.  That language, as this Court \nhas long emphasized, is clear:  \u201cWhat is required by \nCongress is the removal of artificial, arbitrary, and \nunnecessary barriers to employment when the barriers \noperate invidiously to discriminate on the basis of racial \nor other impermissible classification.\u201d  Griggs v. Duke \nPower Co., 401 U.S. 424, 431 (1971).  \u201cDiscriminatory \npreference for any group, minority or majority, is \nprecisely and only what Congress has proscribed.\u201d  Id.  \nImposing a background circumstances requirement on \nmajority-group plaintiffs, as five courts of appeals have \ndone, defies these fundamental principles. \n \nI.  THE FEDERAL COURTS OF APPEALS ARE \nDIVIDED OVER WHETHER MAJORITY-GROUP \nPLAINTIFFS \nMUST \nSHOW \nBACKGROUND \nCIRCUMSTANCES.   \nA. The D.C., Sixth, Seventh, Eighth, and Tenth \nCircuits require background circumstances. \nThe D.C. Circuit was the first court of appeals to apply \na heightened standard for claims brought by majority-\ngroup plaintiffs, doing so in Parker v. Baltimore & Ohio \nRailroad Co., 652 F.2d 1012 (D.C. Cir. 1981).   \nIn that case, Karl Parker, Jr., a white man, \u201cclaim[ed] \nthat his efforts to become a locomotive fireman were \ndefeated by illegal preferences given to black and female \napplicants.\u201d  Id. at 1014.  To examine Parker\u2019s claim, the \n\n15 \n \n \nD.C. Circuit started with McDonnell Douglas, noting that \n\u201cthe standard enunciated in that case remains the \ncornerstone \nof \nevidentiary \nanalysis \nin \ndisparate \ntreatment cases under Title VII.\u201d  Id. at 1016.  But, \naccording to the panel, \u201c[b]efore this test can be applied \nto Parker\u2019s claim, however, a further adjustment must be \nmade.\u201d  Id. at 1017.  \u201cThe original McDonnell Douglas \nstandard,\u201d the D.C. Circuit noted, \u201crequired the plaintiff \nto show \u2018that he belongs to a racial minority.\u2019\u201d  Id.  \n\u201cMembership in a socially disfavored group was the \nassumption on which the entire McDonnell Douglas \nanalysis was predicated, for only in that context can\u201d \nthere be a general \u201cinfer[ence] [of] discriminatory motive \nfrom the unexplained hiring of an outsider rather than a \ngroup member.\u201d  Id.  Although the court acknowledged \nthat \u201c[w]hites are also a protected group under Title VII,\u201d \nit held that \u201cit defie[d] common sense to suggest that the \npromotion of a black employee justifies an inference of \nprejudice against white co-workers in our present \nsociety.\u201d  Id.   Thus, \u201cto prove a prima facie case of \nintentionally disparate treatment,\u201d a majority-group \nplaintiff must point to \u201cbackground circumstances [which] \nsupport the suspicion that the defendant is that unusual \nemployer who discriminates against the majority.\u201d  Id. \nThe D.C. Circuit expounded on the background \ncircumstances rule in Harding v. Gray, 9 F.3d 150 (D.C. \nCir. \n1993). \n \nEmphasizing \nthat \n\u201cinvidious \nracial \ndiscrimination against whites is relatively uncommon in \nour society,\u201d id. at 153, the court elaborated on the sort of \nevidence \nthat \ncould \ndemonstrate \nbackground \ncircumstances.  It identified two specific categories: (1) \n\u201cevidence indicating that the particular employer at issue \nhas some reason or inclination to discriminate invidiously \nagainst\u201d majority groups, and (2) \u201cevidence indicating \n\n16 \n \n \nthat there is something \u2018fishy\u2019 about the facts of the case \nat hand that raises an inference of discrimination.\u201d  Id.  \nFinally, although Harding required a majority-group \nplaintiff to \u201cshow additional background circumstances\u201d \nto \u201cestablish a prima facie case,\u201d it claimed that \u201c[t]his \nrequirement [was] not designed to disadvantage\u201d such a \nplaintiff.  Id. (internal quotation marks omitted). \nIn the wake of Parker and Harding, four other courts \nof appeals soon followed the D.C. Circuit\u2019s lead and \nadopted a background circumstances requirement.  See, \ne.g., Murray v. Thistledown Racing Club, Inc., 770 F.2d \n63, 67 (6th Cir. 1985); Mills v. Health Care Serv. Corp., \n171 F.3d 450, 457 (7th Cir. 1999); Hammer v. Ashcroft, 383 \nF.3d 722, 724 (8th Cir. 2004); Notari v. Denver Water \nDep\u2019t, 971 F.2d 585, 589 (10th Cir. 1992).  \nCritically, though the D.C. Circuit insisted that a \n\u201c\u2018background circumstances requirement,\u2019 [was] not an \nadditional hurdle\u201d for majority-group plaintiffs, Harding, \n9 F.3d at 154, cases from each of these five courts of \nappeals suggest otherwise. \nIn Hairsine v. James, 517 F. Supp. 2d 301, 313 (D.D.C. \n2007), for instance, the court found that a plaintiff\u2019s claim \nof race discrimination foundered for lack of background \ncircumstances.  There was, in the court\u2019s view, \u201cno \nquestion that the record demonstrates that [the plaintiff] \nwas qualified for the Head Deskperson and Group Chief \npositions\u201d\u2014positions that ultimately went to Black \ncandidates.  Id.  But because those candidates were \u201cat \nleast as well qualified,\u201d the plaintiff could not \n\u201cdemonstrate background circumstances raising an \ninference that [his employer] discriminated against him \nbased on his race.\u201d  Id. at 314. \n\n17 \n \n \nThe facts here are even more jarring.  As noted above, \nneither Frierson nor Stoksavljevic was even \u201cat least as \nwell qualified\u201d as Ames.  Id.  To the contrary, \u201ctwice in \none year the Department promoted an arguably less-\nqualified gay employee in a manner adverse to Ames.\u201d  \nApp. 10a (Kethledge, J., concurring).  The Department, in \nfact, \u201ccircumvented its own internal procedures because \nFrierson lacked the minimum qualifications for the job,\u201d \nid., and may have done the same for Stoksavljevic as well, \nApp. 44a.  That should have been enough, at minimum, to \nallow Ames to present her case to a jury.  But based on \n\u201capplication of the \u2018background circumstances\u2019 rule \nalone,\u201d \nthe \nSixth \nCircuit \n\u201cden[ied] \nAmes\u201d \nthat \nopportunity.  App. 10a (Kethledge, J., concurring).   \nThe Sixth Circuit has, beyond this case, elsewhere \nconfirmed that \u201c[a] reverse-discrimination claim carries a \ndifferent and more difficult prima facie burden\u201d because \nplaintiffs bringing such claims must demonstrate \n\u201cbackground circumstances.\u201d  Briggs v. Porter, 463 F.3d \n507, 517 (6th Cir. 2006) (internal quotation marks omitted) \n(emphasis added); see also Pierce v. Commonwealth Life \nIns., 40 F.3d 796, 801 n.7 (6th Cir. 1994) (\u201cWe have serious \nmisgivings about the soundness of a test which imposes a \nmore onerous standard for plaintiffs who are white or \nmale than for their non-white or female counterparts.\u201d), \noverruled on other grounds by Reeves v. Sanderson \nPlumbing Prods., Inc., 530 U.S. 133 (2000). \nCases from the Seventh Circuit likewise acknowledge \nthe unique and more demanding burden borne by \nmajority-group plaintiffs.  In Katerinos v. U.S. \nDepartment of Treasury, 368 F.3d 733, 736 (7th Cir. \n2004), the Seventh Circuit noted that the plaintiff, a white \nmale, needed to show \u201cbackground circumstances\u201d as part \nof \u201chis prima facie case.\u201d  The court, in contrast to the D.C. \n\n18 \n \n \nCircuit\u2019s contention that background circumstances were \n\u201cnot an additional hurdle,\u201d characterized this added \nrequirement as \u201ca major hurdle.\u201d  Compare Harding, 9 \nF.3d at 153, with Katerinos, 368 F.3d at 736.  And because \nthe plaintiff in Katerinos could point to \u201conly one example \nof such circumstances,\u201d his Title VII claim foundered.  Id.  \nSimilarly, in Gore v. Indiana University, 416 F.3d 590 \n(7th Cir. 2005), the court ruled that \u201ca male plaintiff \nalleging gender discrimination must \u201cshow something \nmore than the fact that he is gendered.\u201d  Id. at 592.  \nRather, plaintiffs \u201cin such cases must show background \ncircumstances,\u201d and Gore had \u201coffer[ed] nothing to \novercome this added burden.\u201d  Id. at 592, 593 (internal \nquotation marks omitted). \nCourts in the Eighth Circuit have likewise applied the \nrule to bar potentially meritorious claims.  In Cano v. \nPaulson, for instance, the defendant \u201cconcede[d] that \nplaintiff ha[d] met the first three elements of a prima \nfacie case.\u201d  2008 WL 4378463, at *7 (E.D. Mo. Sept. 23, \n2008).  But plaintiff, according to the defendant, had \n\u201cfailed to establish that the defendant is that unusual \nemployer who discriminates against the majority.\u201d  Id.  \nThe court agreed, dismissing the case.  Id. at *8. \nFinally, in Adamson v. Multi Community Diversified \nServices, Inc., 514 F.3d 1136 (10th Cir. 2008), the Tenth \nCircuit held that a minority-group plaintiff may establish \na \u201cpresumption of invidious intent\u201d under McDonnell \nDouglas \u201cbecause the plaintiff belongs to a disfavored \ngroup.\u201d  Id. at 1149 (emphasis in original).  But \u201c[w]hen \n[a] plaintiff is a member of a historically favored group, by \ncontrast, an inference of invidious intent is warranted only \nwhen background circumstances\u201d are presented.  Id. \n(internal quotation marks omitted).  That \u201cburden,\u201d the \nTenth Circuit explained, \u201cis higher\u201d for majority-group \n\n19 \n \n \nplaintiffs.  Id. at 1141.  And this \u201chigher\u201d burden sank one \nof the claims in Adamson because the plaintiff\u2019s facts fell \n\u201cshort of demonstrating \u2018background circumstances\u2019 \nsufficient \nto \ncreate \nan \ninference \nof \nreverse \ndiscrimination.\u201d  Id. at 1141, 1150. \nB. The Third and Eleventh Circuits have explicitly \nrejected \na \nbackground \ncircumstances \nrequirement. \nCognizant of the difficulties with applying a \nbackground circumstances test, two courts of appeals \nhave explicitly repudiated the requirement.   \nIn Iadimarco v. Runyon, 190 F.3d 151, 160 (3d Cir. \n1999), the Third Circuit summarized the problems posed \nby \nthe \nrule \nand \n\u201creject[ed] \nthe \n\u2018background \ncircumstances\u2019 analysis set forth in Parker, Harding, and \ntheir progeny.\u201d  First, the court noted that, in Parker and \nHarding, the D.C. Circuit claimed \u201cthat the background \ncircumstances test is not an additional hurdle for white \nplaintiffs\u201d and was \u201cmerely a faithful transposition of the \nMcDonnell Douglas/Burdine test.\u201d  Id. at 159 (citing \nHarding, 9 F.3d at 154) (internal quotation marks \nomitted).  But when it came to applying this legal standard \nto actual cases, Iadimarco noted, \u201csome courts have \nconcluded that substituting \u2018background circumstances\u2019 \nfor the first prong of McDonnell Douglas does raise the \nbar.\u201d  Id.  These courts have, like the decisions discussed \nabove in I.A., described background circumstances as \n\u201cimpos[ing] a more onerous burden\u201d or levying a \n\u201cheightened burden\u201d on majority-group plaintiffs.  Id. \n(quoting Eastridge v. Rhode Island Coll., 996 F. Supp. \n161, 166 (D.R.I. 1998), and Ulrich v. Exxon Co., 824 F. \nSupp. 677, 683\u201384 (S.D. Tex. 1993)).  Requiring a plaintiff \nto prove that their supervisor is an \u201cunusual employer\u201d \n\n20 \n \n \nthat discriminates against the majority is an \u201carbitrary \nbarrier which serves only to frustrate those who have \nlegitimate Title VII claims.\u201d  Id. (citing Collins v. Sch. \nDist. of Kansas City, 727 F. Supp. 1318, 1320 (W.D. Mo. \n1990)). \nSecond, imposing background circumstances strays \nfrom Title VII\u2019s text and purpose.  As the Third Circuit \nexplained, the \u201ccentral focus of the inquiry\u201d in a Title VII \nsuit \u201cis always whether the employer is treating some \npeople less favorably than others because of their race, \ncolor, religion, sex, or national origin.\u201d  Id. at 160 (quoting \nFurnco Constr. Corp. v. Waters, 438 U.S. 567, 577 (1978)).  \n\u201c[A]ll that should be required,\u201d then, \u201cis for the plaintiff \nto present sufficient evidence to allow a fact finder to \nconclude that the employer is treating some people less \nfavorably than others based upon a trait that is protected \nunder Title VII.\u201d  Id. at 161.  Asking a plaintiff to state \ntheir case \u201cin terms of \u2018background circumstances\u2019\u201d is \n\u201cboth problematic and unnecessary.\u201d  Id.  \nFinally, \u201cthe concept of \u2018background circumstances\u2019 is \nirredeemably vague and ill-defined.\u201d  Id.  Many courts, \nthe Third Circuit noted, had found it \u201cdifficult, if not \nimpossible, to come up with a definition of \u2018background \ncircumstances\u2019 that is clear, neither under nor over \ninclusive, and possible to satisfy.\u201d  Id. at 162\u201363.  In other \nwords, even if the D.C. Circuit meant for background \ncircumstances \u201cto merely be a restatement of McDonnell \nDouglas,\u201d the test had become \u201ctoo vague and too prone \nto misinterpretation and confusion to apply fairly and \nconsistently.\u201d  Id. at 163\u201364 n.10. \nThe Eleventh Circuit has also declined to impose a \nheightened requirement for majority-group plaintiffs, \nstating decades ago that \u201creverse discrimination\u201d claims \nare held to the same standard as other Title VII claims.  \n\n21 \n \n \nBass v. Bd. of Cnty. Comm\u2019rs, 256 F.3d 1095, 1102\u201303 \n(11th Cir. 2001), overruled in part on other grounds by \nCrawford v. Carroll, 529 F.3d 961 (11th Cir. 2008).  And in \nSmith v. Lockheed-Martin Corp., 644 F.3d 1321, 1325 n.15 \n(11th Cir. 2011), the Eleventh Circuit drew on Bass to \nexplicitly \nreject \na \nbackground \ncircumstances \nrequirement.  Plaintiff in Smith claimed that his former \nemployer, Lockheed-Martin, discriminated against him \nbecause of his race when it fired him for sending an \noffensive email but did not fire Black employees for a \nsimilar infraction.  Id. at 1324.  The court explained that, \nto establish his prima facie case, a plaintiff must show that \nhe is a member of a protected class, and he had done so \nsince race is one such protected characteristic.  Id. at 1325.   \nThe Eleventh Circuit acknowledged that other courts \nhad \u201crequire[d] majority-member plaintiffs to establish\u201d \nbackground circumstances.  Id. at 1325 n.15 (citing \nParker, 652 F.2d at 1017).  But it \u201crejected\u201d that \nrequirement \nbecause, \nas \nthe \ncourt \nemphasized, \n\u201cdiscrimination is discrimination no matter what the race, \ncolor, religion, sex, or national origin of the victim.\u201d  Id. \n(quoting Bass, 256 F.3d at 1103).  More recent cases from \nboth the Third and Eleventh Circuits have, following \nIadimarco and Smith, declined to require a heightened \nshowing for majority-group plaintiffs.  See, e.g., Phillips \nv. Legacy Cabinets, 87 F.4th 1313, 1321 (11th Cir. 2023); \nEllis v. Bank of New York Mellon Corp., 837 F. App\u2019x 940, \n941 n.3 (3d Cir. 2021). \nC. The First, Second, Fourth, Fifth, and Ninth \nCircuits do not apply the rule. \nIn his concurrence, Judge Kethledge grouped the \ncourts of appeals into three categories.  Beyond those that \nhave either explicitly adopted the requirement or \n\n22 \n \n \nexplicitly rejected it, he stated that \u201c[f]ive other[] \n[circuits] simply do not apply it.\u201d  App. 10a.   \nWithin this third category, two courts of appeals\u2014the \nFirst and the Fifth Circuits\u2014have not expressly \naddressed the rule but have in their decisions declined to \nimpose a heightened burden on majority-group plaintiffs.  \nIn Williams v. Raytheon, 220 F.3d 16 (1st Cir. 2000), for \ninstance, the First Circuit applied the traditional \nMcDonnell Douglas framework to a male plaintiff\u2019s claim \nof gender discrimination, with the court holding that the \nplaintiff \u201csustained the \u2018not onerous\u2019 burden of \nestablishing a prima facie case\u201d of gender discrimination.  \nId. at 19 (quoting Texas Dep\u2019t of Cmty. Affairs v. Burdine, \n450 U.S. 248, 253\u201354 (1981)).  In Byers v. Dallas Morning \nNews, Inc., 209 F.3d 419, 426 (5th Cir. 2000), the Fifth \nCircuit held that membership in a majority group \u201cdoes \nnot prevent [an employee] from making a prima facie \ncase of reverse discrimination.\u201d  Instead, a plaintiff must \nonly \u201cbe a member of . . . a group protected under Title \nVII\u201d to bring a claim; the plaintiff in Byers could therefore \nestablish a prima facie case of reverse discrimination even \nthough he \u201cwas not a racial minority in his workplace.\u201d  Id. \nDistrict courts within these two circuits have read \ndecisions like Williams and Byers as constructively \nrejecting background circumstances.  See, e.g., Duchesne \nv. Banco Popular De Puerto Rico, Inc., 742 F. Supp. 2d \n201, 212 (D.P.R. 2010) (\u201cWhile the First Circuit has not \naddressed the \u2018background circumstances\u2019 requirement, \nthe Court gleans from the appellate court\u2019s language that \na heightened burden should not be substituted for the \nfirst prong of McDonnell Douglas.\u201d) (citation omitted); \nMetoyer v. American Eagle Airlines, Inc., 806 F. Supp. \n2d 911, 918 (W.D. La. 2011) (\u201cThe Fifth Circuit, however, \n\n23 \n \n \nand other courts, apply the McDonnell Douglas analysis \nwithout such an additional element.\u201d). \nFinally, and unlike the First and Fifth Circuits, the \nSecond, Fourth, and Ninth Circuits\u2014have addressed the \nbackground circumstances rule but have ultimately \ndeclined to take a side.  In Aulicino v. N.Y.C. Department \nof Homeless Services, 580 F.3d 73 (2d Cir. 2009), the \nSecond Circuit recognized that some courts, like the D.C. \nCircuit, require majority-group plaintiffs to \u201cproffer \nevidence of background circumstances\u201d while others, like \nthe Third Circuit, have rejected the requirement.  Id. at \n80 n.5 (citing Parker, 652 F.2d at 1017, and Iadimarco, \n190 F.3d at 160).  But the court \u201cd[id] not decide\u201d whether \nparties in the Second Circuit must do so.  Id.  The \nAulicino defendants did not argue for the rule and, in any \nevent, there was \u201csufficient evidence\u201d of background \ncircumstances.  Id.  Similarly, the Ninth Circuit has noted \nthe \u201ccircuit split\u201d but held, in Zottola v. City of Oakland, \n32 F. App\u2019x 307, 310\u201311 (9th Cir. 2002), that it \u201cneed not \ntake sides in this inter-circuit dispute\u201d since plaintiff\u2019s \nclaim failed for other reasons.  Likewise, the Fourth \nCircuit has acknowledged that some courts \u201cimpose[] a \nhigher prima facie burden on majority plaintiffs,\u201d but has \n\u201cexpressly decline[d] to decide . . . whether a higher \nburden applies.\u201d  Lucas v. Dole, 835 F.2d 532, 534 (4th Cir. \n1987); accord Weeks v. Union Camp Corp., 215 F.3d 1323, \nat *6 n.13 (4th Cir. 2000) (Table) (\u201cWe have not taken a \nposition on this issue.\u201d). \nUnsurprisingly, \nthis \n\u201cdeciding-not-to-decide\u201d \napproach has not produced a clear or workable framework \nfor plaintiffs, defendants, or judges.  To the contrary, \ncourts in the Second, Fourth, and Ninth Circuits are in \ndisarray.  In the Second Circuit, for instance, most district \n\n24 \n \n \ncourts have \u201crejected a heightened burden of proof\u201d for \nmajority-group plaintiffs.  Pesok v. Hebrew Union Coll.\u2014\nJewish Inst. of Religion, 235 F. Supp. 2d 281, 286 \n(S.D.N.Y. 2002); Maron v. Legal Aid Soc\u2019y, 605 F. Supp. \n3d 547, 558 n.7 (S.D.N.Y. 2022).  But at least one court has \nheld otherwise, applying \u201ca slightly altered analysis\u201d to a \nmajority-group plaintiff.  Olenick v. N.Y. Tel./A NYNEX \nCo., 881 F. Supp. 113, 114 (S.D.N.Y. 1995).  In the same \nvein, at least one Ninth Circuit case has analyzed a sex \ndiscrimination claim without discussing background \ncircumstances.  See Hawn v. Exec. Jet Mgmt., Inc., 615 \nF.3d 1151 (9th Cir. 2010).  And several district courts have \n\u201cexplicitly rejected\u201d a background circumstances rule, \nDucharme v. Las Vegas Metro. Police Dep\u2019t, 2006 WL \n8441859, at *4 (D. Nev. Jan. 19, 2006), or \u201cappl[ied] the \ntraditional, non-modified McDonnell Douglas elements,\u201d  \nto majority-group plaintiffs, Hilber v. Int\u2019l Lining Tech., \n2012 WL 1831558, at *3 n.4 (N.D. Cal. May 18, 2012).  But \njust this year, a district court went the other way, \napplying \nbackground \ncircumstances \nto \nbar \na \ndiscrimination claim.  Seidler v. Amazon, 2024 WL 97351, \nat *5 (W.D. Wash. Jan. 9, 2024).   \nCourts in the Fourth Circuit exemplify this state of \nindecision and confusion.  As one judge from the District \nof South Carolina recently noted, \u201csome courts in this \nDistrict have held that a plaintiff asserting . . . \ndiscrimination against a member of the majority group . . \n. \nmust \nestablish \none \nadditional \nelement\u201d\u2014i.e., \n\u201cbackground circumstances.\u201d  Owen v. Boeing Co., 2022 \nWL 5434230, at *7 n.6 (D.S.C. Mar. 3, 2022).  \u201cHowever, \nother courts in this District have not required plaintiffs to \nprove this extra element to establish a prima facie case.\u201d  \nId.  In other words, different judges in the same district \ncourt have taken different approaches to and required \n\n25 \n \n \ndifferent showings for claims arising under the same \nfederal law. Such circumstances, emblematic of the \nbroader split of authority on this critical issue, underscore \nthe need for this Court\u2019s review. \n \nII. THE \nSIXTH \nCIRCUIT\u2019S \nDECISION \nIS \nINCORRECT.   \nThe Sixth Circuit erred in invoking background \ncircumstances as a basis for denying Ames relief.  That is \nbecause the requirement (a) conflicts with the statutory \ntext, (b) is contrary to precedent, and (c) is already \n\u201cirredeemably vague and ill-defined,\u201d Iadimarco, 190 \nF.3d at 161, and will only become harder to administer.   \nA. Requiring only majority-group plaintiffs to \nshow background circumstances is contrary to \nTitle VII\u2019s text. \n\u201cThis Court has explained many times over many \nyears that, when the meaning of the statute\u2019s terms is \nplain, our job is at an end.\u201d  Bostock v. Clayton Cnty., Ga., \n590 U.S. 644, 673\u201374 (2020).  \u201cThe people,\u201d Bostock notes, \n\u201care entitled to rely on the law as written, without fearing \nthat courts might disregard its plain terms based on some \nextratextual consideration.\u201d  Id. at 674.  But as Judge \nKethledge observed, by imposing a heightened burden on \nmajority-group plaintiffs, the Sixth Circuit and other \ncourts have done just that: \u201cdisregard[ed]\u201d Title VII\u2019s \n\u201cplain terms based on some extratextual consideration,\u201d \nid., thereby leaving \u201ca deep scratch across [the Act\u2019s] \nsurface,\u201d App. 10a (Kethledge, J., concurring).  That is \nbecause Title VII\u2019s plain language does not distinguish \nbetween plaintiffs of different demographic groups.   App. \n\n26 \n \n \n9a (Kethledge, J., concurring).  To the contrary, as this \nCourt has explained, the law explicitly forbids \u201ctreating \n\u2018some people less favorably than others because of their \nrace, color, religion, sex, or national origin.\u2019\u201d Aikens, 460 \nU.S. at 715 (quoting Furnco Constr. Corp., 438 U.S. at \n577)). \nConsistent with that understanding, the Court has \nroutinely rejected similar departures from the Civil \nRights Act\u2019s text.  Bostock, for example, carefully \nreviewed Title VII\u2019s text to hold that the Act prohibits \ndiscrimination based on sexual orientation.  590 U.S. at \n662.  In reaching this conclusion, the Court emphasized \nthat \u201conly the words on the page constitute the law \nadopted by Congress and approved by the President.\u201d  Id. \nat 654.  It is inappropriate for judges to \u201cadd to, remodel, \nupdate, or detract from old statutory terms inspired only \nby extratextual sources and [their] own imaginations.\u201d  Id. \nat 654\u201355.  To do so would \u201cdeny the people the right to \ncontinue relying on the original meaning of the law they \nhave counted on to settle their rights and obligations.\u201d  Id. \nat 655.   \nNext, in his concurring opinion in Students for Fair \nAdmissions, Inc. v. President & Fellows of Harvard \nCollege, 600 U.S. 181, 290 (2023), Justice Gorsuch \nexamined Title VI by reviewing, in part, the text and \nprecedent governing Title VII.  From the premise that \nwhen Congress uses the same terms in the same statute \nthose words \u201chave the same meaning,\u201d Justice Gorsuch \nconcluded that both Title VI and Title VII \u201ccodify a \ncategorical rule of \u2018individual equality.\u2019\u201d  Id. (quoting \nRegents of Univ. of Cal. v. Bakke, 438 U.S. 265, 416 n.19 \n(1978) (Stevens, J., opinion concurring in judgment in part \nand dissenting in part) (emphasis deleted)).  Put another \n\n27 \n \n \nway, \u201cto safeguard the civil rights of all Americans, \nCongress chose a simple and profound rule\u201d barring all \ndiscrimination.  Id.  Courts, Justice Gorsuch underscored, \nhave \u201cno right to make a blank sheet\u201d of either Title of the \nCivil Rights Act.  Id. at 310; see also Smyer v. Kroger Ltd. \nP\u2019ship I, 2024 WL 1007116, at *7 (6th Cir. Mar. 8, 2024) \n(Boggs, \nJ., \nconcurring) \n(asserting \nthat \nSFFA \n\u201csignificantly \nundermined\u201d \nthe \nbackground \ncircumstances analysis). \nLast, in Groff v. Dejoy, 600 U.S. 447, 468 (2023), the \nCourt reiterated that \u201cstatutory interpretation must \nbegin with, and ultimately heed, what a statute actually \nsays.\u201d  Id. (internal quotation marks and alteration \nomitted).  Consequently, Groff held that the term \u201cundue \nhardship\u201d in Title VII should not be read to mean any \neffort or cost that is \u201cmore than [] de minimis\u201d for \npurposes of assessing a worker\u2019s claim for religious \naccommodation, as several lower courts had done.  Id. at \n454.   \nThe reasoning from these opinions contradicts \nParker, which, as Judge Kethledge noted, forms the basis \nof the background circumstances requirement.  App. 10a \n(Kethledge, J., concurring).  Parker did not follow Title \nVII\u2019s text.  Instead, the court there posited that \u201cit \ndefie[d] common sense to suggest that the promotion\u201d of \na minority candidate could \u201cjustif[y] an inference of \nprejudice\u201d against a majority-group plaintiff.  652 F.2d at \n1017.  Although such reasoning was \u201clikely a good faith \neffort to address societal concerns,\u201d Smyer, 2024 WL \n1007116, at *9 (Readler, J., concurring), it ultimately \nbelies Title VII\u2019s mandate of \u201cindividual equality,\u201d SFFA, \n600 U.S. at 310 (Gorsuch, J., concurring)\u2014a mandate \naccomplished by applying the law as written, Groff, 600 \n\n28 \n \n \nU.S. at 468, rather than invoking \u201cextratextual sources,\u201d \nsuch as a judge\u2019s \u201cown imagination,\u201d Bostock, 590 U.S. at \n655, or \u201ccommon sense,\u201d Parker, 652 F.2d at 1017. \nB. The background circumstances rule conflicts \nwith precedent.   \nFor their part, both Parker and the D.C. Circuit\u2019s \nsubsequent decision in Harding tried to characterize \nbackground circumstances as adhering to McDonnell \nDouglas.  After all, the plaintiff in McDonnell Douglas \nestablished his prima facie case by showing that \u201che \nbelong[ed] to a racial minority.\u201d  McDonnell Douglas, 411 \nU.S. at 802.  And in a footnote, this Court observed that, \nbecause \u201c[t]he facts necessarily will vary in Title VII \ncases,\u201d the \u201cspecification\u201d of \u201cthe prima facie proof \nrequired . . . is not necessarily applicable in every respect \nto differing factual situations.\u201d  Id. at n.13.  Thus, read in \nisolation, McDonnell Douglas could justify background \ncircumstances \nfor \nmajority-group \nplaintiffs \nas \na \nnecessary \nupdate \nto \nthat \ncase\u2019s \nburden-shifting \nframework.3 \n \n3 Courts that apply a background circumstances analysis require \nplaintiffs to show such evidence as part of their prima facie case under \nthe McDonnell Douglas framework.  See, e.g., App. 5a, App. 28a.  As \none judge recently noted, however, that underlying framework\u2014that \nis, McDonnell Douglas\u2014lacks a \u201ctextual warrant in Title VII,\u201d is \ninconsistent with the Federal Rules, and should be \u201crelegate[d] . . . to \nthe sidelines.\u201d  Tynes v. Fla. Dep\u2019t of Juvenile Just., 88 F.4th 939, 952, \n958 (11th Cir. 2023) (Newsom, J., concurring).  Petitioner takes no \nposition on this question.  That is because, regardless of the baseline \nlens one employs in evaluating a discrimination claim, imposing a \n\u201cdifferent burden on different plaintiffs based on their membership \nin different demographic groups,\u201d flouts the statutory text and \nrelevant precedent.  App. 9a (Kethledge, J., concurring). \n\n29 \n \n \nBut courts are not supposed to \u201cstitch together\u201d words \nfrom a single case to scaffold a doctrine out of whole cloth.  \nDenezpi v. United States, 596 U.S. 591, 602\u201303 (2022).  \nThat is especially true where, as here, precedent both \nbefore and after McDonnell Douglas disclaims a \nheightened burden for majority-group plaintiffs.   \nGriggs v. Duke Power Co., 401 U.S. 424, 431 (1971)\u2014\ndecided five years before McDonnell Douglas\u2014declared \nthat \u201c[d]iscriminatory preference for any group, minority \nor majority, is precisely and only what Congress has \nproscribed\u201d in Title VII.  McDonnell Douglas itself \nquoted this very passage from Griggs before outlining its \nburden-shifting framework, seemingly making explicit \nthat Title VII protects all individuals from discrimination.  \nMcDonnell Douglas, 411 U.S. at 800\u201301. \nFurthermore, even if some language from McDonnell \nDouglas may have left things muddled, the trend line of \nsubsequent cases is clear.  In McDonald v. Santa Fe Trail \nTransportation Co., 427 U.S. 273, 276 (1976), for instance, \na pair of white plaintiffs alleged that their employer \u201chad \ndiscriminated against\u201d them when it fired them for \nmisconduct but retained a Black employee who had \nparticipated in the same misconduct.  Writing for the \nCourt, Justice Marshall underscored that Title VII\u2019s \n\u201cterms are not limited to discrimination against members \nof any particular race.\u201d  Id. at 278\u201379.  \u201cThe Act prohibits \nall racial discrimination in employment,\u201d he declared, \n\u201cwithout \nexception \nfor \nany \ngroup \nof \nparticular \nemployees.\u201d  Id. at 283 (emphasis in original).  \u201cWe \ntherefore hold today that Title VII prohibits racial \ndiscrimination against the white petitioners in this case \nupon the same standards as would be applicable were \nthey Negroes and Jackson white.\u201d  Id. at 280 (emphasis \n\n30 \n \n \nadded).  Santa Fe Trail, importantly, rejected the \nrespondents\u2019 efforts to rely on McDonnell Douglas for \nsupport, explicitly holding that \u201c[w]e find this case \nindistinguishable from McDonnell Douglas.\u201d  Id. at 282.  \nEmployment criteria \u201cmust be \u2018applied[] alike to \nmembers of all races,\u2019 and Title VII is violated if, as \npetitioners alleged, it was not.\u201d  Id. at 283 (quoting \nMcDonnell Douglas, 411 U.S. at 804). \nCase law after Sante Fe is of a piece.  In U.S. Postal \nService Board of Governors v. Aikens, 460 U.S. 711 (1983), \nthe Court emphasized that \u201cthe factual inquiry in a Title \nVII case is whether the defendant intentionally \ndiscriminated against the plaintiff\u201d\u2014no more, no less.  Id. \nat 715. (internal quotation marks and alteration omitted).4  \nIn Texas Department of Community Affairs v. Burdine, \n450 U.S. 248, 253 (1981), it ruled that \u201c[t]he burden of \nestablishing a prima facie case of disparate treatment is \nnot onerous,\u201d which plainly conflicts with the \u201cdifferent \nand more difficult prima facie burden\u201d shouldered by \nmajority-group plaintiffs like Ames, Briggs, 463 F.3d at \n517.   \nAnd in more recent cases, the Court has held that Title \nVII \u201cfocuses on discrimination against individuals, not \ngroups,\u201d which squarely conflicts with the Sixth Circuit\u2019s \ndecision here to impose a more demanding pleading \n \n4 Aikens did observe that McDonnell Douglas was \u201cnever \nintended to be rigid, mechanized, or ritualistic.\u201d  460 U.S. at 715.  But \nthat comment only means that courts can and should adapt \nMcDonnell Douglas to different employment situations, not different \nplaintiffs.  Though McDonnell Douglas arose in the context of a re-\nhiring decision, for example, this Court and others have adapted it to \naccount for other situations, such as discriminatory discharge, and \nhas modified the relevant aspects of the prima facie case accordingly.  \nSee, e.g., Burdine, 450 U.S. at 255\u201358.   \n\n31 \n \n \nrequirement on an entire sub-group of plaintiffs.  Bostock, \n590 U.S. at 667. \nC. Requiring \nbackground \ncircumstances \nis \nadministratively unwieldy. \nFinally, background circumstances are \u201cirremediably \nvague and ill-defined.\u201d  Iadimarco, 190 F.3d at 161.  One \nway, to be sure, to show such circumstances is through \n\u201cstatistical evidence showing a pattern of discrimination \nby the employer against members of the majority group.\u201d  \nApp. 5a\u20136a.  But gathering such evidence is often a \nchallenging exercise for any plaintiff.  That is especially \nso for an individual like Ames, who cannot\u2014under circuit \nprecedent\u2014\u201cpoint to her own experience to establish a \npattern of discrimination.\u201d  App. 6a. \nYet the other methods for showing background \ncircumstances are even more \u201camorphous,\u201d Iadimarco, \n190 F.3d at 163:  asking plaintiffs to show \u201cthere is \nsomething \u2018fishy\u2019 about the facts of the case at hand,\u201d \nHarding, 9 F.3d at 153, or that their employer is \n\u201cunusual,\u201d Parker, 652 F.2d at 1017.  These standards \nprovide little meaningful guidance.  \u201cWhat may be \u2018fishy\u2019 \nto one [judge] may not be to another.\u201d  Christian Joshua \nMyers, The Confusion of McDonnell Douglas: A Path \nForward for Reverse Discrimination Claims, 44 \nSEATTLE U. L. REV. 1065, 1121 (2021). \nWhat is more, we live in \u201ca world where it has become \nincreasingly difficult to determine who belongs in the \nmajority.\u201d Smyer, 2024 WL 1007116, at *7 (Boggs, J., \nconcurring).   And, to this point, the case law provides little \ninstruction on how to define or circumscribe \u201cmajority\u201d \nand \u201cminority\u201d status given demographic change.  A \nplaintiff who is a racial, gender, or sexual orientation \n\n32 \n \n \nminority in one profession or geography could well be part \nof the majority group in another profession or geography, \nand vice versa.   \nThis case uniquely and vividly captures several of \nthese administrability concerns.  Ames, after all, alleged \nboth sex and sexual orientation discrimination because \nthe Department demoted her in favor of a gay man.  Since \nshe had also been denied a promotion in favor of a gay \nwoman, her \u201cevidence of pretext is notably stronger\u201d as \nto \nsexual \norientation \ndiscrimination \nthan \nsex-\ndiscrimination.  App. 10a (Kethledge, J., concurring).   \nOn sex discrimination, the Sixth Circuit did not require \nbackground \ncircumstances, \ninstead \napplying \nthe \ntraditional \nMcDonnell \nDouglas \nframework \nand \nconcluding, at the final step, that Ames had failed to show \npretext.  App. 6a\u20138a.  But on sexual orientation \ndiscrimination, where Ames\u2019s \u201cevidence of pretext [was] \nnotably stronger\u201d and which involved the same demotion \ndecision between the same two employees, the Sixth \nCircuit never even reached McDonnell Douglas\u2019s final \nstep.  App. 10a (Kethledge, J., concurring).  Instead, \n\u201capplication of the \u2018background circumstances\u2019 rule alone\u201d \nprevented Ames from receiving \u201ca jury trial on this \nclaim.\u201d  Id.  There is no plausible way that Congress \nmeant for this result when it enacted Title VII.   \n \nIII. \n THIS CASE IS AN IDEAL VEHICLE TO \nDECIDE \nAN \nIMPORTANT \nISSUE \nOF \nDISCRIMINATION LAW.   \nJudge Kethledge captured the depth and importance \nof the issue at hand when he wrote that \u201cnearly every \ncircuit has addressed this issue one way or another.  \n\n33 \n \n \nPerhaps the Supreme Court will soon do so as well.\u201d  App. \n11a.  Foisting a background circumstances rule departs \nfrom \ntext \nand \nprecedent \nand \nis \n\u201cprone \nto \nmisinterpretation and confusion.\u201d  Iadimarco, 190 F.3d at \n163 n.10.  Disagreement over the rule has resulted in a \ndeep, defined, and open circuit split; \u201c[i]t appears that the \nFederal Circuit is the only circuit not to opine on the \nissue.\u201d  Smyer, 2024 WL 1007116, at *7 n.1 (Boggs, J., \nconcurring).  The split has been analyzed in scholarship, \nsee supra Myers, and recognized by courts, see Aulicino, \n580 F.3d at 80 n.5.  And it touches on a critical question:  \nAs this Court has recognized, \u201cfew pieces of federal \nlegislation rank in significance with the Civil Rights Act \nof 1964.\u201d  Bostock, 590 U.S. at 649\u201350. \nThis case offers an ideal opportunity to resolve this \nimportant split.  To start, Ames\u2019s case cleanly and \nsquarely presents the legal question at hand.  As the Sixth \nCircuit observed, \u201cthe necessary showing of \u2018background \ncircumstances\u2019 is the principal issue,\u201d as the rest of \nAmes\u2019s prima facie case was \u201ceasy to make.\u201d  App. 5a.  \nJudge Kethledge spoke in even stronger terms:  Because \nof the \u201capplication of the \u2018background circumstances\u2019 rule \nalone . . . we deny Ames a jury trial on\u201d her sexual \norientation discrimination claim.  App. 10a.   \nWhat is more, the Sixth Circuit\u2019s disposition rendered \nMs. Ames\u2019s case final.  Seven of her eight claims were \ndismissed by the district court, and Ames elected not to \nappeal those claims to the Sixth Circuit.  App. 3a, 26a.    \nWhen the Sixth Circuit disposed of the remaining Title \nVII \ncount\u2014for \nsex \nand \nsexual \norientation \ndiscrimination\u2014it left nothing for the district court to \ndecide.  Ames now seeks review only on her sexual \norientation discrimination claim.  Such facts make this \n\n34 \n \n \nmatter an excellent vehicle to address this important \nquestion in employment discrimination law that has \ndivided the federal courts of appeals. \n \nCONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, the petition for a writ of \ncertiorari should be granted. \n \nRespectfully submitted, \n \nEDWARD L.

GILBERT \nCO., L.P.A., Akron, Ohio, for Appellant. Cathleen B. \nSlater, Megan E. Jewett, OFFICE OF THE OHIO \nATTORNEY GENERAL, Columbus, Ohio, for Appellee. \nThe court delivered a PER CURIAM opinion. \nKETHLEDGE, J. (pp. 7\u20138), delivered a separate \nconcurring opinion. \n\n3a \n \n \n \nOPINION \n \nPER CURIAM. Marlean Ames sued the Ohio \nDepartment of Youth Services under Title VII of the Civil \nRights Act of 1964, asserting claims of discrimination \nbased on sexual orientation and sex. The district court \ngranted summary judgment to the Department, holding \nthat Ames lacked evidence of \u201cbackground circumstances\u201d \nnecessary to establishing her prima-facie case for her \nclaim based on sexual orientation, and that Ames lacked \nevidence of pretext for purposes of her sex-discrimination \nclaim. We affirm. \nI. \n \nWe view the evidentiary record in the light most \nfavorable to Ames. See Sloat v. Hewlett-Packard Enter. \nCo., 18 F.4th 204, 207 (6th Cir. 2021). \n \nThe Ohio Department of Youth Services oversees the \nconfinement and rehabilitation of juvenile felony offenders \nin the state. The Department hired Ames, a heterosexual \nwoman, in 2004, and in 2014 it made her its Administrator \nof the Prison Rape Elimination Act (which the \nDepartment referred to as \u201cPREA\u201d). The position was \n\u201cunclassified,\u201d meaning that Ames was an at-will employee \nwho could be dismissed without cause. Ohio Rev. Code \n\u00a7 124.11. \n \nIn 2017, Ames was assigned a new supervisor, Ginine \nTrim, who is gay. Trim reported to Assistant Director \nJulie Walburn. In a December 2018 performance \nevaluation, Trim said that Ames met \u201cexpectations\u201d in ten \ncompetencies and exceeded them in one. In January 2019, \nOhio\u2019s governor appointed Ryan Gies to be the \n\n4a \n \n \nDepartment\u2019s Director. Walburn and Gies are both \nheterosexual. \n \nIn April 2019, Ames applied and interviewed to be the \nDepartment\u2019s Bureau Chief of Quality. The Department \nchose not to hire her for that position. In a conversation \nafter the interview, Trim congratulated Ames on 30 years \nof public service, but also suggested that Ames retire. \nFour days later, on May 10, 2019, Walburn and Human \nResources Administrator Robin Gee called Ames into a \nmeeting \nwhere \nthey \nterminated \nher \nas \nPREA \nAdministrator and gave her the option of returning to her \nprevious position, which would amount to a demotion. \nAmes took the demotion, reducing her wages from $47.22 \nan hour to $28.40. The Department then selected \nAlexander Stojsavljevic, a 25-year-old gay man, for the \nposition of PREA Administrator, informing him two \nbusiness days later of his promotion. Later, in December \n2019, the Department chose Yolanda Frierson, a gay \nwoman, as its Bureau Chief of Quality. \n \nAmes later filed a discrimination charge with the Equal \nEmployment Opportunity Commission, which issued a \nright-to-sue letter. Ames then brought this suit, in which \nthe district court granted summary judgment. This appeal \nfollowed. \nII. \n \nWe review the district court\u2019s grant of summary \njudgment de novo. See Spees v. James Marine, Inc., 617 \nF.3d 380, 388 (6th Cir. 2010). \n \nAmes sought to prove her discrimination claims by \nindirect evidence, which required her to show the \nfollowing: (1) that she was a member of a protected class; \n(2) that she was subject to an adverse employment \ndecision; (3) that she was qualified for the relevant \nposition; (4) and that her employer treated more favorably \n\n5a \n \n \na similarly qualified person who was not a member of the \nsame protected class. Jackson v. VHS Detroit Receiving \nHosp., Inc., 814 F.3d 769, 776 (6th Cir. 2016). \nA. \n \nWe begin with Ames\u2019s claim of discrimination based on \nsexual orientation, in which she says the Department \ndiscriminated against her when it denied her a promotion \nto Bureau Chief and demoted her from the position of \nPREA Administrator. Ames is heterosexual, however, \nwhich means she must make a showing in addition to the \nusual ones for establishing a prima-facie case. Specifically, \nAmes must show \u201cbackground circumstances to support \nthe suspicion that the defendant is that unusual employer \nwho discriminates against the majority.\u201d Arendale v. City \nof Memphis, 519 F.3d 587, 603 (6th Cir. 2008) (cleaned up); \nsee also Murray v. Thistledown Racing Club, Inc., 770 \nF.2d 63, 67 (6th Cir. 1985). \n \nWhether Ames made the necessary showing of \n\u201cbackground circumstances\u201d is the principal issue here. \nFor otherwise Ames\u2019s prima-facie case was easy to make: \nher claim is based on sexual orientation, which is a \nprotected ground under Title VII, see Bostock v. Clayton \nCounty, 140 S. Ct. 1731, 1737 (2020); she was demoted \nfrom her position as PREA Administrator and had held \nthat position for five years, with reasonably good reviews; \nand she was replaced by a gay man. Moreover, for the \nBureau Chief position that Ames was denied, the \nDepartment chose a gay woman. \n \nWhere Ames founders, however, is on the requisite \nshowing \nof \n\u201cbackground \ncircumstances.\u201d \nPlaintiffs \ntypically make that showing with evidence that a member \nof the relevant minority group (here, gay people) made the \nemployment decision at issue, or with statistical evidence \nshowing a pattern of discrimination by the employer \n\n6a \n \n \nagainst members of the majority group. See Zambetti v. \nCuyahoga Cmty. Coll., 314 F.3d 249, 257 (6th Cir. 2002); \nSutherland v. Mich. Dep\u2019t of Treasury, 344 F.3d 603, 615 \n(6th Cir. 2003). But Ames has made neither showing. First, \nAmes was terminated as PREA Administrator by \nWalburn and Gies, who are both heterosexual. Ames does \nargue that Trim, a gay woman, was the person who denied \nher the position of Bureau Chief and who instead chose \nFrierson, who is also gay. But Ames argued in the district \ncourt that Walburn and Gies were the decisionmakers for \nthat position, which means that Ames\u2019s argument that \nTrim was the decisionmaker is forfeited. See Watkins v. \nHealy, 986 F.3d 648, 667 (6th Cir. 2021). Second, Ames\u2019s \nonly evidence of a pattern of discrimination against \nheterosexuals is her own demotion and the denial of the \nBureau Chief position. Under our caselaw, however, a \nplaintiff cannot point to her own experience to establish a \npattern of discrimination. See Sutherland, 344 F.3d at 615 \n(requiring statistical evidence beyond plaintiff\u2019s own \nexperience to prove pattern); see also Treadwell v. Am. \nAirlines, Inc., 447 F. App\u2019x 676, 678-79 (6th Cir. 2011). \n \nAmes therefore has not made the necessary showing of \n\u201cbackground circumstances.\u201d For that reason her claim of \nsexual-orientation discrimination fails. \nB. \n \nAmes next argues that a jury could find that she was \ndemoted from her position as PREA Administrator \nbecause of her sex. The Department concedes that Ames \nhas stated a prima-facie case as to this claim, because she \nwas replaced by a man. But the Department has provided \nnondiscriminatory reasons for her demotion: namely, that \nGies had been appointed Director of the Department a few \nmonths before, in January 2019; that Gies wanted to \nimprove the Department\u2019s performance regarding \u201csexual \nvictimization[,]\u201d and wanted \u201cpeople in places that can \n\n7a \n \n \nfulfill the vision of moving us forward, not just meeting \nminimum standards\u201d; and that Ames\u2019s 2018 evaluation \nshowed she mostly met expectations rather than exceeded \nthem, and needed improvement in some areas. \n \nTo demonstrate pretext, a plaintiff must ultimately \nprove both that her employer\u2019s stated reason for the \nadverse employment decision \u201cwas not the real reason for \nits action, and that the employer\u2019s real reason\u201d was \ndiscrimination. E.E.O.C. v. Ford Motor Co., 782 F.3d 753, \n767 (6th Cir. 2015) (en banc). At summary judgment, \nhowever, a plaintiff need only produce evidence that would \nallow a jury to find that her employer\u2019s stated reason \u201cis \nunworthy of credence.\u201d Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing \nProd., Inc., 530 U.S. 133, 147 (2000); see Miles v. S. Cent. \nHum. Res. Agency, Inc., 946 F.3d 883, 888 (6th Cir. 2020). \nTo that end, a plaintiff can typically create a genuine issue \nof fact by producing evidence that the employer\u2019s stated \nreason (1) had no basis in fact; (2) did not actually motivate \nthe employer\u2019s actions; or (3) was insufficient to motivate \nthe employer\u2019s actions. See Briggs v. Univ. of Cincinnati, \n11 F.4th 498, 515 (6th Cir. 2021). \n \nAmes contends that the Department\u2019s reasons for \ndemoting her had no basis in fact. But Gies was in fact \nappointed in January 2019, a few months before Ames\u2019s \ndemotion; and her evaluation the month before was \nlukewarm in many respects and critical in some others. \nSpecifically, for 10 of 11 of the \u201ccompetencies\u201d for which \nAmes was evaluated, her rating was \u201cmeets expectations\u201d \nrather than that she \u201cexceeds\u201d them. And in three areas\u2014\nproviding \naccurate \nguidance \nto \n\u201cother \ngroups[,]\u201d \n\u201c[p]erforming \nday-to-day \n(routine) \nadministrative \ntasks[,]\u201d and managing and distributing \u201call PREA grant-\nrelated funds[,]\u201d the report noted that she had \u201can \nopportunity to improve[.]\u201d The report therefore provides \nsome support for the Department\u2019s stated reasons for \n\n8a \n \n \ndemoting her, which means they had some basis in fact. \nAmes therefore has not created a genuine issue of fact on \nthis ground. See Miles, 946 F.3d at 888-89 (\u201cFor a \nplaintiff\u2019s challenge to the factual basis of an employer\u2019s \nproffered termination rationale to establish pretext, the \nplaintiff must provide evidence that the employer\u2019s \nallegations never happened.\u201d). \n \nAmes also contends that that the Department has \noffered shifting justifications for Ames\u2019s demotion, which \nin her view is evidence that the Department\u2019s stated \nreasons did not actually motivate its decision to demote \nher. Ames is right that the Department has offered \ndifferent reasons for her demotion at different times. \nWhen Walburn and Gee told Ames about her demotion, \nthey refused to provide any reason for it. Later, before the \nEEOC, the Department said that it demoted Ames \nbecause her position was at-will and that it could remove \nher at any time without cause. And Gies, in his deposition, \nsaid that Ames was not the right person to fulfill his \n\u201cvision\u201d of exceeding PREA minimum standards rather \nthan just meeting them. Absent some conflict between an \nemployer\u2019s nondiscriminatory reasons for an adverse \nemployment decision, however, that the employer offers \nmore than one of them\u2014even at different times\u2014is not \nenough to create a genuine issue of fact as to pretext. \nMiles, 946 F.3d at 891. Hence this contention likewise falls \nshort. \n \nFinally, the Department\u2019s process for promoting \nStojsavljevic to the PREA Administrator position was not \nso irregular as to create a genuine issue as to pretext. On \nthat issue Ames provides no evidence other than her own \nexperience in applying for the PREA Administrator \nposition. Such evidence is insufficient. Nor were Ames\u2019s \nqualifications for that position so \u201cobjectively superior\u201d to \nStojsavljevic\u2019s as to create a genuine issue as to pretext. \n\n9a \n \n \nThe district court was correct to grant summary \njudgment. \n*    *    * \n \nThe district court\u2019s judgment is affirmed. \n \nCONCURRENCE \n \n \nKETHLEDGE, Circuit Judge, concurring. I join the \ncourt\u2019s opinion in full, but write to express my \ndisagreement with the rule that we must apply here. Title \nVII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 bars employment \ndiscrimination against \u201cany individual\u201d\u2014itself a phrase \nthat is entirely clear\u2014\u201cbecause of such individual\u2019s race, \ncolor, religion, sex, or national origin[.]\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-\n2(a)(1). Thus, to state the obvious, the statute bars \ndiscrimination against \u201cany individual\u201d on the grounds \nspecified therein. Yet our court and some others have \nconstrued this same provision to impose different burdens \non different plaintiffs based on their membership in \ndifferent demographic groups. Specifically\u2014to establish a \nprima-facie case when (as in most cases) the plaintiff relies \nupon indirect evidence of discrimination\u2014members of \n\u201cmajority\u201d groups must make a showing that other \nplaintiffs need not make: namely, they must show \n\u201cbackground circumstances to support the suspicion that \nthe defendant is that unusual employer who discriminates \nagainst the majority.\u201d Zambetti v. Cuyahoga Cmty. Coll., \n314 F.3d 249, 255 (6th Cir. 2002) (cleaned up) (quoting \nMurray v. Thistledown Racing Club, Inc., 770 F.2d 63, 67 \n(6th Cir. 1985)). \n \nOur panel is bound to apply this rule here, since Ames \nclaims that the Department discriminated against her \nbecause of her status as a heterosexual. As a member of a \n\n10a \n \n \nmajority group, Ames must make the requisite showing of \n\u201cbackground circumstances\u201d; and, as our opinion explains, \nshe has not done so. Meanwhile, nobody disputes that \nAmes has established the other elements of her prima-\nfacie case, which would be enough to establish that case if \nshe were a gay person. And Ames\u2019s evidence of pretext is \nnotably stronger for this claim than for her sex-\ndiscrimination one: twice in one year the Department \npromoted an arguably less-qualified gay employee in a \nmanner adverse to Ames; and in promoting one of those \nemployees, \nYolanda \nFrierson, \nthe \nDepartment \ncircumvented its own internal procedures because \nFrierson lacked the minimum qualifications for the job. \nThus\u2014based \nour \napplication \nof \nthe \n\u201cbackground \ncircumstances\u201d rule alone\u2014we deny Ames a jury trial on \nthis claim.  \n \nThe \u201cbackground circumstances\u201d rule is not a gloss \nupon the 1964 Act, but a deep scratch across its surface. \nThe statute expressly extends its protection to \u201cany \nindividual\u201d; \nbut \nour \ninterpretation \ntreats \nsome \n\u201cindividuals\u201d worse than others\u2014in other words, it \ndiscriminates\u2014on the very grounds that the statute \nforbids. Yet five circuits (including our own) have adopted \nthe \u201cbackground circumstances\u201d rule since the D.C. \nCircuit first adopted it in 1981. See Parker v. Balt. & Ohio \nR. R. Co., 652 F.2d 1012, 1017-18 (D.C. Cir. 1981); Murray, \n770 F.2d at 67; Mills v. Health Care Serv. Corp., 171 F.3d \n450, 455-57 (7th Cir. 1999); Hammer v. Ashcroft, 383 F.3d \n722, 724 (8th Cir. 2004); Notari v. Denver Water Dep\u2019t, 971 \nF.2d 585, 588-89 (10th Cir. 1992). Two circuits have \nexpressly rejected this rule. See Iadimarco v. Runyon, \n190 F.3d 151, 157-62 (3d Cir. 1999); Smith v. Lockheed-\nMartin Corp., 644 F.3d 1321, 1325 n.15 (11th Cir. 2011). \nFive others simply do not apply it. See Williams v. \nRaytheon Co., 220 F.3d 16, 18-19 (1st Cir. 2000); Aulicino \n\n11a \n \n \nv. N.Y.C. Dep\u2019t of Homeless Servs., 580 F.3d 73, 80-81 & \nn.5 (2d Cir. 2009); Lightner v. City of Wilmington, N.C., \n545 F.3d 260, 264-65 (4th Cir. 2008); Byers v. Dallas \nMorning News, Inc., 209 F.3d 419, 426 (5th Cir. 2000); \nHawn v. Exec. Jet Mgmt., Inc., 615 F.3d 1151, 1156 (9th \nCir. 2010). \n \nRespectfully, our court and others have lost their \nbearings in adopting this rule. If the statute had \nprescribed this rule expressly, we would subject it to strict \nscrutiny (at least in cases where plaintiffs are treated less \nfavorably because of their race). And nearly every circuit \nhas addressed this issue one way or another. Perhaps the \nSupreme Court will soon do so as well. \n \n \n \n\n12a \n \n \nAPPENDIX B \n \n \n \n\n13a \n \n \nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF OHIO \nEASTERN DIVISION \nMARLEAN A. AMES,  \nPlaintiff, \nv. \nSTATE OF OHIO \nDEPARTMENT OF \nYOUTH SERVICES, \nDefendant. \n: \n: \n: \n: \n: \n: \n: \n: \n: \n \nCase No. 2:20-cv-05935 \n \nChief Judge            \nAlgenon L. Marbley \nMagistrate Judge \nElizabeth P. Deavers \n \nOPINION & ORDER \n \nThis matter comes before the Court on the Motion for \nSummary Judgment of Defendant State of Ohio \nDepartment \nof \nYouth \nServices \n(\u201cDYS\u201d \nor \n\u201cthe \nDepartment\u201d). (See ECF No. 71). This case arises from \nallegations of sex-based discrimination experienced by \nPlaintiff Marlean Ames in the course of her employment \nwith DYS. For the reasons set forth more fully below, the \nCourt GRANTS Defendant\u2019s motion. \nI. BACKGROUND \nA. Factual Background \n \nThere are two incidents at the core of Ames\u2019s \nallegations. The Court begins by laying out the \nbackground context of employment within a state agency, \ndescribes Ames\u2019s employment history with DYS, and then \ndelves into the two incidents in detail.1 \n \n1 The facts set forth below are largely drawn from Defendant\u2019s Motion \nfor Summary Judgment (ECF No. 71), as Ames has stated that \u201c[t]he \nStatement of Facts included in the Defendant\u2019s Motion for Summary \n\n14a \n \n \n1. The Ohio Civil Service and the Department of \nYouth Services \n \nDYS is a state agency that oversees juvenile \ncorrections, parole, and the rehabilitation of youth \nthrough community programs. See generally Ohio Rev. \nCode ch. 5139. The Department\u2019s offices consist of the \nagency headquarters located at the central office in \nColumbus, three (3) juvenile correctional facilities, and \nfive (5) district sites for parole services. (See Declaration \nof Kelly East (\u201cEast Decl.\u201d) \u00b6 4, ECF No. 71-4). The \ncorrectional facilities are: Circleville Juvenile Correctional \nFacility (\u201cCJCF\u201d); Cuyahoga Hills Juvenile Correctional \nFacility \n(\u201cCHJCF\u201d); \nand \nIndian \nRiver \nJuvenile \n \nJudgment is largely correct\u201d and appears to adopt portions of \nDefendant\u2019s Statement of Facts verbatim in her reply brief. There are \ntwo exceptions. First, Ames suggests that Defendant has omitted one \nfactual allegation regarding comments made by Alex Stojsaljevic. \n(Memo. in Opp\u2019n at 1, ECF No. 72). The omitted allegation is included \nand discussed infra. \nAmes also requests that the unsworn statements presented by \nDefendant\u2019s witnesses, which Defendant relies on in its Statement of \nFacts, be struck. (Id. at 1). Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c) requires that \u201c[a] party \nasserting that a fact cannot be . . . genuinely disputed must support \nthe assertion by [] citing to particular parts of materials in the record, \nincluding depositions, documents, electronically stored information, \naffidavits, or declarations, stipulations (including those made for \npurposes of the motion only), admissions, interrogatory answers, or \nother materials.\u201d Further, \u201c[a]n affidavit or declaration used to \nsupport or oppose a motion must be made on personal knowledge, set \nout facts that would be admissible in evidence, and show that the \naffiant or declarant is competent to testify on the matters stated.\u201d \nFed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(4). Defendant\u2019s Statement of Facts is supported \nby a number of declarations and depositions. Each declaration is \nsigned and sworn under penalty of perjury. (See, e.g., Declaration of \nRobin Gee at 4, ECF No. 71-1). Similarly, each deponent was first duly \nsworn before testifying. (See, e.g., Deposition of Ryan Gies 6:1\u20133, ECF \nNo. 69). As such, Defendant has fully complied with the requirements \nof Rule 56; Ames\u2019s request to strike is without basis and is therefore \ndenied. \n\n15a \n \n \nCorrectional Facility (\u201cIRJCF\u201d). See Facilities, OHIO \nDEP\u2019T \nOF \nYOUTH \nSERVS., \nhttps://dys.ohio.gov/facilities/welcome. \n \nThe Department employs around 961 individuals, \nspread across nine divisions. (See Memo. in Supp. Mot. for \nSumm. J. (\u201cMemo. in Supp.\u201d) at 2, ECF No. 71). DYS \nemployees are either classified or unclassified civil \nservants, as the Department falls within Ohio\u2019s civil \nservice. See Ohio Rev. Code \u00a7 124.11. Classified \nemployees, if in a skilled position, must pass a civil service \nexamination, see id. \u00a7 124.11(B)(1), and are typically \nemployed in non-managerial positions. Cf. id. \u00a7 124.11(A) \n(noting that the unclassified service includes elected \nofficials, members of boards and commissions, heads of \ndepartments, etc.). Classified civil servants enjoy \n\u201cconsiderable job protection,\u201d including a statutory \nfallback right. Campbell v. Wash. Cnty. Pub. Libr. Bd. of \nTrs., No. 04CA44, 2005 WL 1405789, at *2 (Ohio Ct. App. \nJune 10, 2005). Unclassified employees, on the other hand, \n\u201cserve at the pleasure of their appointing authority, and \nmay be dismissed from their employment with or without \ncause.\u201d McClain v. Nw. Cmty. Corr. Ctr. Jud. Corr. Bd., \n440 F.3d 320, 330 (6th Cir. 2006) (quoting Campbell, 2005 \nWL 1405789, at *2 (internal citations omitted)). \nUnclassified positions include elected officials and \ndepartment \nofficials; \nmany \nhigh-level \nmanagerial \npositions within state agencies are also unclassified. See, \ne.g., Ohio Rev. Code \u00a7 124.11(A)(9). In the case of DYS, \nunclassified positions are appointed by the Director of the \nDepartment. See id. \u00a7 5139.01(B). The \u201cfallback right\u201d \nallows a classified employee who is appointed to an \nunclassified position to retain the right to \u2018fall back\u2019 to her \nmost recently held classified position\u2014that is, \u201cto resume \nthe position and status held . . . in the classified service \nimmediately prior to [her] appointment to the position in \n\n16a \n \n \nthe unclassified service\u201d\u2014if her unclassified position is \nrevoked. Ohio Rev. Code \u00a7 124.11(D)(2). \n \nBecause of the unique nature of unclassified positions, \nthe application and interview process for these positions at \nDYS differs greatly from the equivalent process for \nclassified positions. For example, openings for unclassified \npositions are not required to be posted and do not require \ninterviews. (See Declaration of Robin Gee (\u201cGee Decl.\u201d) \n\u00b6\u00b6 7\u201311, ECF No. 71-1). Additionally, whereas an \napplicant for a classified position within DYS must \ncomplete an application upon seeing an open position \nposting and an HR analyst must evaluate her \nqualifications before the applicant interviews for the \nposition, the sequence of events for filling unclassified \npositions in DYS is less rigid; the application and even the \nqualifications verification may occur after an individual \nhas already been interviewed or appointed. (Id. \u00b6\u00b6 11, 13\u2013\n14). \n2. Employment History with the Department \n \nAmes first began working for DYS in 2004. (Deposition \nof Marlean Ames (\u201cAmes Dep.\u201d) 37:14\u201316, ECF No. 62). \nShe started as an Executive Secretary in the Akron Parole \nRegion, before moving to the IRJCF in the same role in \n2005. (Id. 37:19\u201323). This position was in the classified civil \nservice. (See id. 53:4\u20135, 19\u201322). In early 2009, Ames was \nappointed to a position with the specification of \nAdministrative Assistant 3 and a working title of \nCommunity Facility Liaison,2 which was part of the \n \n2 Employment positions are referred to by both \u201cclass specification\u201d \nand by a \u201cworking title\u201d or \u201cposition.\u201d The \u201cspecification\u201d is, in effect, \nthe grade level as set by the Ohio Department of Administrative \nServices for positions at all state agencies. (See Declaration of Kelly \nEast (\u201cEast Decl.\u201d) \u00b6 6, ECF No. 71-4). Each department or agency \nmay have multiple \u201cpositions\u201d for a given \u201cclass specification.\u201d A \n\u201cposition\u201d or \u201cworking title\u201d is specific to the actual role and is a more \n\n17a \n \n \nunclassified civil service. (Id. 54:6\u201314). The specification of \nthe position later changed from Administrative Assistant \n3 to Program Administrator 2, but with no alteration to \nAmes\u2019s responsibilities or pay grade. (See id. 72:3\u201320; \nAmes Dep. Ex. 7, ECF No. 62-1 at 10). As Community \nFacility Liaison, Ames did not supervise or direct other \nemployees; her primary responsibilities included assisting \nher supervisor in evaluating, monitoring, and inspecting \nfacilities and facility programs, and working with facilities \nto ensure compliance with the Ohio Administrative Code. \n(See Ex. 6, ECF No. 62-1 at 9). The role also required \nAmes to help facilities comply with the Prison Rape \nElimination Act of 2003 (\u201cPREA\u201d), 34 U.S.C. \u00a7 30301\u201309. \n(Id.; see also Ames Dep. 74:18\u201321, ECF No. 62). The role \nwas based out of the Department\u2019s central office in \nColumbus. (Ames Dep. 60:19\u201320, ECF No. 62). \n \nIn 2014, Ames was promoted to the position of PREA \nAdministrator, located within the DYS Office of Quality \nand Improvement. (Id. 38:5\u20137). The position of PREA \nAdministrator \nhad \na \nspecification \nof \nProgram \nAdministrator 3 and was unclassified. (See id. 78:16\u201323). \nAs PREA Administrator, Ames did not supervise any \nemployees. (See Ex. D, ECF No. 71-4 at 16). She was \ninitially supervised by Wendy Faulkner, who Ames \nidentified as a \u201cstraight female,\u201d until 2017, when Ginine \nTrim, who Ames identified as a member of the \u201cLBGTI\u201d \ncommunity, took over. She had good, professional working \nrelationships with both Faulkner and Trim. (See Ames \nDep. 94:12\u201315, 95:2\u20136, 96:7\u201320, ECF No. 62; Deposition of \nJulie Walburn (\u201cWalburn Dep.\u201d) 17:14\u2013 16, ECF No. 60). \nAt the time, Trim was the Deputy Director of the Division \n \ntailored label based on the requirements and responsibilities of the \nrole. (See id. \u00b6 7; Memo. in Supp. at 12 & n.6, ECF No. 71). A position \nis not classified (in terms of the classified/unclassified distinction) \nsimply because it has a class specification. \n\n18a \n \n \nof Professional Standards and Chief Inspector in the \nOffice of Quality and Improvement. (See Deposition of \nGinine Trim (\u201cTrim Dep.\u201d) 25:6\u201312, ECF No. 64). Trim \nreported to Julie Walburn, the assistant director of DYS, \nwho reported to Ryan Gies, the director of DYS appointed \nby Governor DeWine in 2019. (Id. 27:22\u201325; see Deposition \nof Ryan Gies (\u201cGies Dep.\u201d) 13:7\u20139, ECF No. 69). Ames had \nno personal knowledge about the sexual orientation of \nWalburn or Gies but assumed that Gies was straight. \n(Ames Dep. 109:1\u20135, 110:5\u20139, ECF No. 62). \n \nIn 2019, while Ames was still serving as PREA \nAdministrator, the Office of Quality and Improvement \nannounced the creation of a new position: the Bureau Chief \nof Quality Assurance and Improvement.3 (See id. 115:23\u2013\n2; Trim. Dep. 79:2\u20138, ECF No. 64). Ames applied and \ninterviewed for the position but did not receive the \npromotion. (See Ames Dep. 116:19\u2013117:3, ECF No. 62). \nShortly afterward, on May 10, 2019, Robin Gee, from the \nDepartment\u2019s HR team, and Walburn informed Ames that \nshe was being removed from her unclassified position as \nPREA Administrator and offered her the option of \ninvoking her statutory fallback right. (Id. 97:4\u201317; Gee \nDecl. \u00b6\u00b6 22, 31, ECF No. 71-1). Ames eventually accepted \nthe decision and returned to her most recently classified \nposition as an Administrative Professional 4 (the new \nclassification for Executive Secretary 1, the position Ames \nhad last held in 2009 before she was appointed to the \nunclassified position of Administrative Assistant 3) at the \nIndian River facility. (Ames Dep. 99:22\u2013100:15, ECF No. \n62).  She is currently still employed by the Department, \nafter being promoted to Human Services Program \nAdministrator 2, an unclassified position. (See Memo. in \nSupp. at 7, ECF No. 71). \n \n3 The \u201cclass specification\u201d for this position is Administrative Officer 3. \n\n19a \n \n \n \nThe two adverse employment events of 2019\u2014first, the \ndecision not to appoint Ames to the position of Bureau \nChief of Quality Assurance and, second, the decision to \nrevoke \nher \nunclassified \nappointment \nas \nPREA \nAdministrator\u2014are described more fully in the following \nsections. \n3. Application for Appointment to Bureau Chief \n \nWalburn envisioned the new position of Bureau Chief \nof Quality Assurance as a management role responsible for \nproviding leadership and oversight of staff members in the \nOffice of Quality and Improvement. (See East Decl. Ex. B, \nECF No. 71-4 at 10). Management, workforce planning, \nand supervision were among the knowledge areas that the \nDepartment was looking for in applicants to the position. \n(Id.). Once Department leadership decided to create the \nposition, Trim announced the position to the employees \nwithin the Office of Quality and Improvement via both \nemail and an informal internal meeting and invited any \ninterested team members to apply. (Trim Dep. 79:13\u201320, \n87:21, 88:7\u201320, EF No. 64). \n \nThree team members, including Ames, applied for the \nposition and interviewed with Trim and Walburn in April \n2019. (Ames Dep. 117:11\u201316, 119:7\u20139, ECF No. 62). In \npreparation for the interview, Ames conducted research \nand generated ideas about how to address deficiencies \nwith the Department\u2019s facilities in a more holistic, \nmultidisciplinary fashion. (See id. 119:9\u201319; 123:3\u201312). \nAmes felt confident coming out of the interview, especially \nas Walburn had expressed interest in an article on juvenile \njustice that Ames mentioned and Walburn and Trim had \ngiven Ames positive feedback at the end of the interview. \n(See id. 125:8\u2013126:13). Overall, Ames felt like Walburn and \nTrim gave her a fair shot. (Id. 126:14\u201316). Walburn and \nTrim, however, had a different impression about Ames\u2019s \nsuitability for the role. In particular, Walburn expressed \n\n20a \n \n \nconcern that Ames failed to lay out her \u201cvision for what the \njob was meant to do or any vision for how to get the job \ndone . . . [or] ideas on how to lay the foundation for this \nrole.\u201d (Walburn Dep. 40:9\u201314, ECF No. 60; see also Trim \nDep. 90:8\u201311, ECF No. 64) (suggesting that Ames \u201cwasn\u2019t \nable to really express the vision\u201d for the position). Walburn \nalso worried that Ames lacked the requisite leadership \nskills for the position. (See Walburn Dep. 40:24\u201341:1, ECF \nNo. 60). \n \nAmes was not hired for the position. Walburn and Trim \nhad not set a deadline for filling the Bureau Chief position \nand decided to prioritize finding the best fit over hiring \nsomeone promptly. (See Walburn Dep. 34:17\u201321, ECF No. \n60). Six months later, Yolanda Frierson, who also worked \nin the Office of Quality and Improvement, reached out to \nTrim to ask about the status of the search process for a \nnew Bureau Chief. Neither she nor her colleagues in the \nOffice had heard any updates from Walburn or Trim since \nApril about any of the three applicants and was unsure if \nthe position was still open or even still existed. (See \nDeposition of Yolanda Frierson (\u201cFrierson Dep.\u201d) 48:9\u2013\n50:23, ECF No. 63). On December 10, 2019, Trim offered \nthe Bureau Chief position to Frierson on a temporary \nbasis, which she accepted. (Id. 75:25\u201376:5; see id. 74:6\u2013 \n75:8; 77:4\u20139). Frierson was then given a permanent \nappointment as Bureau Chief on January 23, 2020.4 \n(Frierson Dep., Ex. 47, ECF No. 63-1 at 18). \n \nAlthough Trim informed Frierson of the appointment, \nit was Walburn who had decided to select Frierson and \nrecommended her appointment to Gies. (See Trim Dep. \n91:20\u201392:2, 92:21\u2013 93:1, ECF No. 64) (noting that Trim did \nnot have decisionmaking power and that the final decision \nfor the Bureau Chief appointment rested with Walburn \n \n4 The effective date of the appointment was January 19, 2020. (id.). \n\n21a \n \n \nand Gies).  Whereas Walburn had expressed fears that \nAmes lacked vision and leadership, Walburn had worked \nwell with Frierson in the past and felt that Frierson had \ngood ideas on how to formulate the Bureau Chief position. \n(See Walburn Dep. 35:2\u20137, 20\u201323, 37:12\u201316, ECF No. 60). \nImportantly, \nFrierson \nhad \npreviously \nworked \nin \nmanagement roles within the Department, where she had \ngained experience supervising other employees and \ncompleting performance evaluation\u2014tasks that Ames had \nnever handled. (See Declaration of Yolanda Frierson \n(\u201cFrierson Decl.\u201d) \u00b6\u00b6 6, 8, ECF No. 71-5) (describing her \nwork supervising staff as Unit Manager at SJCF and as \nDeputy Superintendent of Direct Services at CJCF). \nFrierson had joined DYS in 2006, two years after Ames; \nprior to the promotion to Bureau Chief, she had served as \na Juvenile Corrections Officer, a Unit Manager, and a \nHuman Services Program Administrator 2 at SJCF, \nbefore moving to CJFC as a Deputy Superintendent and \nthen to the Department\u2019s Columbus office as Facility \nResource Administrator and later Human Services \nProgram Administrator 3 (with a brief return to CJCF as \nDeputy Superintendent of Program Services in between). \n(Id. \u00b6\u00b6 2, 5\u201311). Frierson identifies as female and gay. \n(Frierson Dep. 10:14\u201319, ECF No. 63). \n4. Removal as PREA Administrator \n \nThe lack of vision identified by Walburn during Ames\u2019s \ninterview for Bureau Chief ultimately resulted in her \nremoval from her position as PREA Administrator as well. \nThe Governor\u2019s Office had indicated to Gies, upon his \nappointment as Director, that addressing issues of sexual \nvictimization within the juvenile corrections system was a \npriority concern. (See Gies Dep. 62:19\u201363:4, ECF No. 69). \nGies quickly set about reorganizing the Department, \ncombining the previously separate Chief Inspector\u2019s \nOffice and the Office of Quality and Improvement into a \n\n22a \n \n \nsingle division. (Declaration of Ginine Trim (\u201cTrim Decl.\u201d) \n\u00b6\u00b6 7\u20139, ECF No. 71-3). This reorganization required \nmoving personnel around: Trim, for example, moved from \nthe Office of Technology to the new division. (Id. \u00b6 8). \n \nIn his previous role as deputy director for the parole \ncourts and community division of DYS, Gies had \nsupervised Ames and had signed off on strong reviews of \nher performance each year between 2011 to 2013. (See \nGies Dep. 28:2\u201330:22, ECF No. 69). But, apparently, Gies\u2019s \nimpression of Ames as an employee took a downward turn \nbetween then and when he was appointed Director, based \non feedback he had received from community partners \nthat Ames was difficult to work with, abrasive, and not \ncollaborative (though the feedback did not contain any \ncriticisms of her work ethic or dedication). (See id. 31:22\u2013\n32:6). And whereas the Governor\u2019s Office wanted Gies to \nrevamp the Department\u2019s PREA approach, Gies recalls \nWalburn expressing concerns that Ames \u201cdid not have a \nvision and could not carry the culture of our facilities and \npreventing victimization from occurring.\u201d (Id. 63:19\u201323). \nWalburn was worried, specifically, that Ames would be \nunable to steer DYS towards more proactively complying \nwith PREA standards. (Walburn Dep. 20:18\u201321:10). One \nsticking point was Ames\u2019s administration of PREA grant \nfunds; Trim, Ames\u2019s direct supervisor, remembered Gies \nand Walburn being unhappy with the slow rollout of \ngrants. (See Trim Dep. 36:22\u201337:8, 40:8\u201312, ECF No. 64). \nIn fact, Trim noted in a performance review that Ames \nneeded to improve her management of PREA grant funds \n(though \nshe \nnevertheless \nrated \nAmes\u2019s \noverall \nperformance as meeting expectations). (Id. 40:19\u201321). \n \nBased on the sum of these concerns, Gies and Walburn \nmade the decision to remove Ames from her classified \nposition as PREA Administrator. (See Walburn Dep. \n54:22\u201355:1, ECF No. 60). They discussed potential \n\n23a \n \n \nreplacements and eventually settled on Alex Stojsavljevic. \n(Gies Dep. 73:19\u201320, 75:23\u201346:5, ECF No. 76).  Gies does \nnot recall the precise timeline of these discussions \n(including whether any such discussions occurred before \nAmes was notified of the decision), but is adamant that he \nand Walburn agreed not to contact any potential \ncandidates prior to removing Ames. (Id. 74:1975:4). Gies \nliked Stojsavljevic as a potential candidate because he had \nworked firsthand with Stojsavljevic, Stojsavljevic had \nexperience with PREA while at the Indian River facility, \nand Gies felt that Stojsavljevic had demonstrated strong \nplanning and communication skills. (See id. 79:5\u201314). \n \nAmes claims that her demotion and replacement by \nStojsavljevic was part of a long-running scheme to kick her \nout. She claims that Trim had previously suggested to her \na number of times that she should consider resigning or \nreturning to the Indian River facility to be closer to home. \n(See Ames Dep. 191:12\u2013192:18, ECF No. 62). Trim does \nnot recall any such conversations with Ames. (Trim Dep. \n52:1\u20136, ECF No. 64). Ames also claims that Stojsavljevic \nhad apparently been angling for Ames\u2019s position for some \ntime, stating in front of their coworkers that he wanted the \nPREA Administrator position. (See Ames Dep. 179:2\u20135, \nECF No. 62). Stojsavljevic acknowledges telling Ames, as \nwell as other co-workers, but characterized it as an inside \njoke between the two of them. (See Deposition of Alex \nStojsavljevic (\u201cStojsavljevic Dep.\u201d) 67:10\u2013 68:11, ECF No. \n61). At the time, he and Ames were living together with \nroommates. (Ames Dep. 174:15\u201321, ECF No. 62). Ames \nconsidered him not only a friend, but also a mentee, though \nshe was worried at times about Stojsavljevic\u2019s impatient \nattitude \ntowards \nclimbing \nthe \nranks \nwithin \nthe \nDepartment and his claims that he could manipulate \npeople to get what he wanted on the basis of being a gay \nman. (See id. 180:18\u2013183:1). And Ames was concerned that \n\n24a \n \n \nthese claims might have been true, because she had heard \nthat Stojsavljevic had been promoted to PREA \nCompliance Manager at IRJCF in October 2017 without \neven being eligible for the promotion. The superintendent \nthere, Chris Freeman, apparently devised a work-around \nto the rule that employees on probationary status, like \nStojsavljevic, \ncould \nnot \nbe \npromoted; \nhe \nasked \nStojsavljevic to resign from his job and then hired him in \nthe new role the next day.5 (See id. 188:10\u2013190:1). \n \nAmes \nalso \nclaims \nthat \nStojsavljevic\u2019s \nformer \nsupervisors, Stephanie Groff and Jodi Slagle, had \nreassured him that they would help him with his goal of \nbecoming PREA Administrator. (See id. 175:8\u201320; see also \nStojsavljevic Dep. 52:10\u201324, ECF No. 61). Further, Ames \nclaims that Slagle, who was friendly and familiar with Gies, \nwent to Gies about Stojsavljevic\u2019s desire for the job. (Ames \nDep. 175:21\u2013176:1, ECF No. 62). This claim is not \ncorroborated by other deponents; Stojsavljevic, for \nexample, remembers Slagle and Groff telling him, in \nresponse to his interest in the PREA Administrator \nposition, that Ames \u201cwas not going to move out of that \nposition\u201d but that they would \u201chelp [him] get more PREA \nexperienced or activities that [he] wanted to do \nsurrounding PREA.\u201d (Stojsavljevic Dep. 93:23\u201394:14, \nECF No. 61). Gies makes no mention in his deposition of \nany such conversation with Slagle, or, in fact, any \nawareness of Stojsavljevic\u2019s interest in the job. (See Gies \nDep. 85:7\u201314, ECF No. 69). \n \nGies and Walburn finalized the decision to appoint \nStojsavljevic as the new PREA Administrator on May 26, \n2019. (See id. 91:22\u201392:2). Gies had been told by others at \nthe Department that Stojsavljevic was gay some years \n \n5 Ames does not have first-hand knowledge of this event. (Id. 189:22\u2013\n190:1). \n\n25a \n \n \nprior, but did not have any personal knowledge to that \neffect. (See id. 90:17\u201391:17). Trim also knew that \nStojsavljevic was gay, though she did not have any role in \nthe decision to appoint him; she was informed of the \ndecision to promote Stojsavljevic by Walburn after the \ndecision was made. (Trim Dep. 70:11\u201371:3, ECF No. 64). \nB. Procedural Background \n \nPlaintiff filed a charge of discrimination against \nDefendant Ohio Department of Youth Services with the \nOhio Civil Rights Commission and the U.S. Equal \nEmployment Opportunity Commission (\u201cEEOC\u201d) on \nAugust 21, 2019. (See Pl.\u2019s Ex. 3, ECF No. 1-3). The EEOC \nreached a determination of reasonable cause and issued a \n90-day right to sue letter on September 8, 2020. (Id.). \nSubsequently, on November 18, 2020, Ames filed her \ninitial Complaint (ECF No. 1) in this Court, alleging eight \ncauses of action under federal and state law. Ames later \namended her complaint. (See Am. Compl., ECF No. 28). In \nthe Amended Complaint, Ames again asserted eight \nclaims: (1) gender and sexual orientation discrimination \npursuant to Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 \nU.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2000e to 2000e-17; (2) hostile work environment \nbased on sexual orientation and age under Title VII; (3) \nretaliation under Title VII; (4) age discrimination under \nthe Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, 29 \nU.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 621\u201334; (5) violations of due process rights under \nthe Fourteenth Amendment; (6) age discrimination under \nOhio Rev. Code ch. 4112;6 (7) gender discrimination under \nOhio Rev. Code ch. 4112; and (8) hostile work environment \nunder Ohio Rev. Code ch. 4112. \n \n6 Plaintiff did not specify a statute within Chapter 4112 for Counts      \n6\u20138. \n \n\n26a \n \n \n \nOn June 23, 2021, Defendant DYS filed its Motion for \nJudgment on the Pleadings (ECF No. 31). The Court \ndismissed Counts 2\u20137, finding that: (1) the Plaintiff had \nfailed to state a claim with regards to her Title VII hostile \nwork environment, Title VII retaliation, and Fourteenth \nAmendment due process claims (Counts 2, 3, and 5, \nrespectively); (2) the Court lacked subject matter \njurisdiction over Plaintiff\u2019s ADEA claim (Count 4); and \n(3) Plaintiff\u2019s state law claims (Counts 6, 7, and 8) were \nbarred by the State\u2019s sovereign immunity under the \nEleventh Amendment. (See generally Op. & Order, ECF \nNo. 50). Count 4 was dismissed with prejudice, and Counts \n2, 3, 5, 6, 7, and 8 dismissed without prejudice. The parties \nsubsequently engaged in extensive discovery. On June 10, \n2022, Defendant DYS filed its Motion for Summary \nJudgment (ECF No. 71) as to the remaining Title VII sex-\nbased discrimination claim. That motion is now ripe for \nthis Court\u2019s review. \nII.  STANDARD OF REVIEW \n \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(a) states that \nsummary judgment is appropriate \u201cif the movant shows \nthat there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and \nthe movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d The \nCourt must view the evidence in the light most favorable \nto the non-moving party, and draw all reasonable \ninferences in the non-movant\u2019s favor. S.E.C. v. Sierra \nBrokerage Servs., Inc., 712 F.3d 321, 327 (6th Cir. 2013) \n(citing Tysinger v. Police Dep\u2019t of City of Zanesville, 463 \nF.3d 569, 572 (6th Cir. 2006)). This Court then asks \n\u201cwhether \u2018the evidence presents a sufficient disagreement \nto require submission to a jury or whether it is so one-\nsided that one party must prevail as a matter of law.\u2019\u201d \nPatton v. Bearden, 8 F.3d 343, 346 (6th Cir. 1993) (quoting \nAnderson v. Liberty Lobby, 477 U.S. 242, 251\u201352 (1986)). \nSummary judgment is inappropriate, however, \u201cif the \n\n27a \n \n \nevidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a \nverdict for the non-moving party.\u201d Anderson, 477 U.S. at \n248. Evidence that is \u201cmerely colorable\u201d or \u201cnot \nsignificantly probative\u201d is not enough to defeat a motion \nfor summary judgment, id. at 249\u201350, nor is \u201c[t]he mere \nexistence of a scintilla of evidence to support [the non-\nmoving \nparty\u2019s] \nposition\u201d \nsufficient. \nCopeland \nv. \nMachulis, 57 F.3d 476, 479 (6th Cir. 1995); see also \nAnderson, 477 U.S. at 251. \n \nThe initial burden rests upon the movant to present the \nCourt with law and argument in support of its motion, and \nto identify the relevant portions of \u201c\u2018the pleadings, \ndepositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on \nfile, together with the affidavits, if any,\u2019 which it believes \ndemonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of material \nfact.\u201d Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323 (1986) \n(quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 56). If this initial burden is \nsatisfied, the burden then shifts to the nonmoving party to \nset forth specific facts showing that there remains a \ngenuine issue for trial. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e); see also \nCox v. Ky. Dep\u2019t of Transp., 53 F.3d 146, 150 (6th Cir. 1995) \n(noting that after the burden shifts, the nonmovant must \n\u201cproduce evidence that results in a conflict of material fact \nto be resolved by a jury\u201d). \nIII. \n   LAW & ANALYSIS \n \nAllegations of discrimination in the employment \ncontext may be established by the introduction of either \ndirect evidence of discrimination or by providing \ncircumstantial evidence that supports an inference of \ndiscrimination. See Kline v. Tenn. Valley Auth., 128 F.3d \n337, 348 (6th Cir. 1997) (citing Talley v. Bravo Pitino Rest., \nLtd., 61 F.3d 1241, 1248 (6th Cir. 1995)). Direct evidence of \ndiscrimination, such as \u201c\u2018eyewitness\u2019 testimony as to the \nemployer\u2019s mental processes,\u201d U.S. Postal Serv. Bd. of \nGovernors v. Aiken, 460 U.S. 711, 716 (1983), is rarely \n\n28a \n \n \navailable, see Kline, 128 F.3d at 348, and Ames has \nacknowledged that her \u201cevidence of discrimination is \nentirely circumstantial\u201d in this case. (See Pl.\u2019s Resp. at 5, \nECF No. 72). \n \nIn assessing allegations of discrimination based on \ncircumstantial evidence, courts rely on the burden-shifting \nframework set forth in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. \nGreen, 411 U.S. 792, 802\u201304 (1973). Under that framework, \nthe plaintiff alleging discrimination bears the initial \nburden of establishing a prima facie case of retaliation, by \ndemonstrating that: \u201c(1) he or she was a member of a \nprotected class; (2) he or she suffered an adverse \nemployment action; (3) he or she was qualified for the \nposition; and (4) he or she was replaced by someone \noutside the protected class or was treated differently than \nsimilarly-situated, non-protected employees.\u201d Briggs v. \nUniv. of Cincinnati, 11 F.4th 498, 508 (6th Cir. 2021) \n(quoting Wright v. Murray Guard, Inc., 455 F.3d 702, 707 \n(6th Cir. 2006) (internal citations omitted)). Where the \nplaintiff is a member of a majority group, however, she \nbears an additional \u201cburden of demonstrating that [s]he \nwas intentionally discriminated against \u2018despite [her] \nmajority status.\u2019\u201d Murray v. Thistledown Racing Club, \nInc., 770 F.2d 63, 67 (6th Cir. 1985) (internal citations \nomitted). \nAs \nsuch, \na \nplaintiff \nalleging \nreverse \ndiscrimination \nmust \nshow \nthat \n\u201cbackground \ncircumstances support the suspicion that the defendant is \nthat unusual employer who discriminates against the \nmajority\u201d to establish the first prong of the prima facie \ncase. Id. (quoting Parker v. Balt. & Ohio R.R. Co., 652 F.2d \n1012, 1017 (D.C. Cir. 1981)); see also Romans v. Mich. \nDep\u2019t of Hum. Servs., 668 F.3d 826, 837 (6th Cir. 2012) \n(internal citations omitted). \n \nIf a plaintiff is able to demonstrate a prima facie case \nof employment discrimination, the burden shifts to the \n\n29a \n \n \ndefendant to provide a \u201clegitimate, nondiscriminatory \nreason\u201d for its actions. McDonnell Douglas, 411 U.S. at \n802. This is satisfied if the employer \u201cexplains what [it] has \ndone or produces evidence of legitimate nondiscriminatory \nreasons.\u201d Texas Dep\u2019t of Cmty. Affs. v. Burdine, 450 U.S. \n248, 256 (1981). And, if the employer is able to satisfy its \nburden, \u201cthe burden of production shifts back to [Plaintiff] \nto demonstrate that [the employer\u2019s] proffered reason was \na mere pretext for discrimination.\u201d Kenney v. Aspen \nTechs., Inc., 965 F.3d 443, 448 (6th Cir. 2020) (citing Abbott \nv. Crown Motors Co., 348 F.3d 537, 542 (6th Cir. 2003)). \nThere are three ways in which a plaintiff can demonstrate \npretext: \u201c(1) that the proffered reasons had no basis in law, \n(2) that the proffered reasons did not actually motivate the \nemployer\u2019s actions, or (3) that they were insufficient to \nmotivate the employer\u2019s actions.\u201d Romans, 668 F.3d at 839 \n(quoting Chen v. Dow Chem. Co., 580 F.3d 394, 400 (6th \nCir. 2009)). The essential question for courts evaluating \nclaims of pretext is \u201cwhether the employer made a \nreasonably informed and considered decision before \ntaking an adverse employment decision.\u201d Burdine, 450 \nU.S. at 256. \n \nHaving set forth the analytical framework for \nemployment discrimination claims pursuant to Title VII, \nthe Court now turns to the allegations made by Ames in \nthis case. Ames alleges two instances of discrimination: \nfirst, the failure to promote her to the position of Bureau \nChief; and second, the decision to revoke her appointment \nas PREA Administrator. (See Pl.\u2019s Resp. at 4, ECF No. \n72). Ames alleges that both instances constitute sex-based \ndiscrimination,7 because she is a woman and is \n \n7 Ames refers to both bases of discrimination as \u201cgender-based.\u201d (See, \ne.g., Pl.\u2019s Resp. at 4, ECF No. 72). Title VII bars discrimination on the \nbasis of an individual\u2019s \u201crace, color, religion, sex, or national origin.\u201d \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2. Title VII does not, on the other hand, mention \n\n30a \n \n \nheterosexual. Cf. Bostock v. Clayton Cnty., 140 S. Ct. 1731, \n1743 (2020) (affirming that discrimination on account of \nsexual orientation or gender identity is \u201cin part because of \nsex\u201d). \nA.  Failure to Promote \n \nAs set forth previously, Ames applied for a promotion \nto the position of Bureau Chief of Quality Assurance and \nImprovement in April 2019, but did not receive the \npromotion. That position was eventually given to Yolanda \nFrierson, a gay woman, on a full-time basis in January \n2020. Ames alleges that the decision to choose Frierson \nover her demonstrates sex-based reverse discrimination in \nviolation of Title VII\u2014in other words, that she was denied \nfor the position because she is heterosexual.8 \n \nAccordingly, this Court evaluates Ames\u2019s failure-to-\npromote claim under the modified McDonnell Douglas \nburden-shifting framework set forth above, under which \nAmes must point to \u201cbackground circumstances\u201d to \nestablish the first prong of her prima facie case. Examples \nof \u201cbackground circumstances\u201d sufficient to demonstrate \nthat an employer has discriminated against a majority \ngroup include statistical analysis of the employer\u2019s \nunlawful consideration of protected characteristics in past \n \ngender-based discrimination. Similarly, Bostock, which Ames cites for \nthe proposition that a gender-based discrimination claim may be \nbased \non \nsexual \norientation, \nactually \ndiscussed \nsex-based \ndiscrimination. Bostock, 140 S. Ct. at 1737 (noting, in explaining the \nholding, that \u201c[s]ex plays a necessary and undisguisable role in the \ndecision [to fire an individual for being homosexual or transgender], \nexactly what Title VII forbids\u201d). Accordingly, the Court refers to \nAmes\u2019s claims as rooted in allegations of sex-based discrimination, not \ngender-based discrimination, throughout this Opinion & Order. \n8 In contrast to Ames\u2019s claim regarding the revocation of her \nappointment as PREA administrator, this incident does not state a \nclaim for discrimination against Ames as a woman because Frierson is \nalso a woman. \n\n31a \n \n \nemployment decisions, see Sutherland v. Mich. Dep\u2019t of \nTreasury, 344 F.3d 603, 614 (6th Cir. 2003), the fact that a \nminority employer replaced the plaintiff with another \nemployee of the same minority group, see Zambetti v. \nCuyahoga Cmty. Coll., 314 F.3d 249, 257 (6th Cir. 2002), \nand evidence of \u201corganizational preference\u201d for hiring \nmembers of a minority group. Nelson v. Ball Corp., 656 \nF. App\u2019x 131, 136\u201337 (6th Cir. 2016) (quoting Sampson v. \nSec\u2019y of Transp., 182 F.3d 918, 1999 WL 455399, at *1 (6th \nCir. June 23, 1999) (unpublished)); see also Romans, 668 \nF.3d at 837 (noting that evidence of past hiring policies \nfavoring minority applicants may demonstrate the \nnecessary \n\u201cbackground \ncircumstances\u201d \nof \nreverse \ndiscrimination (internal citations omitted)). \n \nAmes is unable to meet this threshold requirement. \nShe has not \u201cpresent[ed] significant evidence in the form \nof statistical data tending to show in the years prior to the \nemployment decisions at issue, the [] Department \nconsidered [sexual orientation] in making employment \ndecisions.\u201d Sutherland, 344 F.3d at 615. She has not \n\u201csubmitted a large number of [Department] policies and \nprocedures which reflect an organizational preference for \nestablishing a diverse group of employees,\u201d or in fact any \nsuch Department policies or procedures to that affect. \nSampson, 1999 WL 455399, at *1. And, perhaps most \nimportantly, she has not demonstrated that her adverse \nemployment action was authorized by or involved any \nindividuals who were also members of the same minority \ngroup as Frierson (that is, the LGBTI community);9 in \n \n9 The Court adopts Ames\u2019s use of the label \u201cLGBTI,\u201d which stands for \n\u201clesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and intersex\u201d and is the term \nused by the Officer of the United Nations High Commissioner of \nHuman Rights (as compared to the terms \u201cLGBTQ\u201d or \u201cLGBTQ+,\u201d \nwhich are more commonly used in the United States). \n \n\n32a \n \n \nfact, the undisputed evidence in this case is that Walburn \nand Gies, both of whom Ames believes are heterosexual, \nmade the decision not to promote her and to select \nFrierson instead. See Nelson, 656 F. App\u2019x at 137 (\u201cMost \nfatal to Nelson\u2019s prima facie case [of reverse race \ndiscrimination] is the undisputed fact that all of the \nemployees involved in the investigation and subsequent \ntermination of Nelson were Caucasian.\u201d). Moreover, \nneither Gies nor Walburn had personal knowledge about \nFrierson\u2019s or Ames\u2019s sexual orientation. \n \nThe only support Ames can provide for a finding of \n\u201cbackground circumstances\u201d is that she has allegedly \nsuffered two adverse employment decisions on account of \nher sex\u2014which, Ames argues, \u201cconstitutes a pattern.\u201d \n(Pl.\u2019s Resp. at 5, ECF No. 72). But two data points are not \nenough to establish a pattern. Cf. IAN FLEMING, \nGOLDFINGER (1959) (\u201cMr. Bond, they have a saying in \nChicago: \u2018Once is happenstance. Twice is coincidence. The \nthird time, it\u2019s enemy action.\u2019\u201d). Compare, for example, the \nstatistical evidence presented in Sutherland: there, \nplaintiffs provided a statistical analysis of the percentage \nof auditor positions at the employer held by different \ndemographics across a twenty-year span. Sutherland, 344 \nF.3d at 615\u201316. In Zambetti, plaintiff\u2019s allegations \nincluded evidence of the employer\u2019s hiring practices over \na six (6) year span. Zambetti, 314 F.3d at 256; see also id. \nat 257 (noting the difficulty of drawing inferences from \nhiring data without knowing the \u201ccomposition of the \napplicant pools for those positions\u201d). These cases \ndemonstrate that extensive, rigorous evidence is required \nto establish a pattern for the purposes of \u201cbackground \ncircumstances,\u201d given the unusual form of discrimination \nat issue. Moreover, the two incidents that comprise the \n\u201cpattern\u201d alleged by Ames are her own (as yet unproven) \nallegations in the case sub judice. See id. at 256 (describing \n\n33a \n \n \nevidence produced by plaintiff of past employment \ndecisions relating to third parties); cf. Brooks v. Am. \nBroad. Cos., Inc., 999 F.2d 167, 172 (6th Cir. 1993) (\u201c[T]he \ndistrict court was not required to accept unsupported, self-\nserving testimony as evidence sufficient to create a jury \nquestion.\u201d (citing Comfort Trane Air Conditioning Co. v. \nTrane Co., 592 F.2d 1373, 1383 (5th Cir. 1979)).  Therefore, \nthe Court concludes that Ames\u2019s own allegations of two \ndiscriminatory adverse events are, on their own, clearly \ninsufficient to establish the \u201cbackground circumstances\u201d \nnecessary for a plaintiff to make a prima facie case of \nreverse discrimination. \n \nWhere a plaintiff is unable to satisfy the first prong of \nthe prima facie case of employment discrimination, the \nCourt is not required to reach the second and third steps \nof the McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting framework. \nZambetti, 314 F.3d at 257 (citing Murray, 770 F.2d at 68; \nJamison v. Storer, 830 F.2d 194, 1987 WL 44901, at *3 (6th \nCir. Sept. 30, 1987) (unpublished)). As Ames has failed to \ndemonstrate \u201cbackground circumstances support[ing] the \nsuspicion that [DYS] is that unusual employer who \ndiscriminates against the majority,\u201d Murray, 770 F.2d at \n68 (quoting Parker, 652 F.2d at 1017), the Court finds that \nshe has failed to satisfy her burden of establishing a prima \nfacie case of sex-based employment discrimination for her \nfailure-to-promote \nclaim. \nAccordingly, \nthe \nCourt \nGRANTS Defendant\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment \n(ECF No. 71) as to the failure to promote claim. \nB.  Revocation from PREA Administrator Position \n \nThe decision to demote Ames from the PREA \nAdministrator position presents a more complicated \nanalysis, as she was replaced with Stojsavljevic, a gay \nman; this claim, in other words, presents allegations of \ndiscrimination on the basis that Ames is heterosexual and \n\n34a \n \n \nalso on the basis that Ames is a woman.10 The Court \naddresses each alleged basis for discrimination in turn, \nstarting with the allegation of discrimination based on \nsexual orientation. \n \nAs noted previously with respect to Ames\u2019s failure to \nprotect claim, a plaintiff alleging reverse discrimination in \nthe employment context must establish the existence of \n\u201cbackground circumstances\u201d in order to carry her burden \nof making out a prima facie case of discrimination. Ames \nalleges the same form of reverse discrimination here as \nshe did regarding the decision not to promote her to \nBureau Chief: that is, Ames claims that she was replaced \nas PREA Administrator on account of being heterosexual. \nBut the same deficiencies that plagued Ames\u2019s failure to \npromote claim crop up here too. She has neglected to \nprovide \nany \nstatistical evidence \nof \npast \nreverse \ndiscrimination, any indication of policies or procedures \nindicating \norganizational \npreferences \nfor \nminority \napplicants, or any suggestion that the decisionmakers \nbehind her demotion (and the subsequent promotion of \nStojsavljevic) were members of the LGBTI community. \nSee supra Part III.A. Without such evidence, the Court \nconcluded that Ames could not establish a prima facie case \nof discrimination based on sexual orientation for her \nfailure to protect claim; similarly, the Court concludes that \nshe is also unable to establish a prima facie case of reverse \ndiscrimination based on sexual orientation for her \ndemotion claim. \n \nThe Court next considers Ames\u2019s claim that she was \ndemoted and replaced by Stojsavljevic because she is a \nwoman. The Department acknowledges that Ames can \ncarry her burden of establishing a prima facie claim with \n \n10 DYS phrases this as a \u201crevocation\u201d of Ames\u2019s unclassified status; as \nthe decision effectively demoted Ames, the Court variously refers to \nthe May 2019 decision as a revocation or a demotion. \n\n35a \n \n \nrespect to this issue. (See Memo. in Supp. at 29, ECF No. \n71). It is undisputed, after all, that Ames is a member of a \nprotected class (as a female), was qualified for her role as \nPREA Administrator, was terminated (i.e., an adverse \nemployment action), and was replaced by a male \nemployee. See Briggs, 11 F.4th at 508. The Department \nsuggests, however, that the decision to revoke Ames\u2019s \nposition as PREA Administrator was based on legitimate, \nnondiscriminatory business reasons. (Memo. in Supp. at \n29\u201330, ECF No. 71). These reasons include Gies\u2019 desire to \nrevamp the Department\u2019s PREA strategy into a more \nproactive approach, based in part on the Governor\u2019s \nconcern with sexual victimization in juvenile correctional \nfacilities, and Walburn\u2019s concerns that Ames did not have \nthe vision, ability, or leadership skills to carry out Gies\u2019 \nvision. (See id.). The reasons also included the negative \nfeedback that Gies had received about Ames being \nabrasive and a difficult person with whom to work. See \nThompson v. Bd. of Educ., No. 3:12-cv-00327, 2013 WL \n6001626, at *7 (S.D. Ohio Nov. 12, 2013) (finding that the \nemployer\u2019s determination that plaintiff employee would \nnot be a good fit because he was \u201carrogant, a know-it-all, \nand an overly-assertive person\u201d was a \u201chonest, legitimate, \nand non-discriminatory\u201d rationale). Gies explicitly noted in \nhis testimony that the question of who would replace Ames \nin the PREA Administrator role was not a consideration \nin the decision to remove Ames and, in fact, was not \ndiscussed until after the removal decision had already \nbeen made. \n \nAs to the final step in the burden-shifting framework, \nthe Department argues that Ames is unable to \ndemonstrate that the proffered rationale has no basis in \nfact, did not actually motivate Gies and Walburn\u2019s \ndecision, or was insufficient to motivate Gies and \nWalburn \u2014 in short, that Ames is unable to show pretext. \n\n36a \n \n \n(See Memo. in Supp. at 31\u201336, ECF No. 71). First, DYS \nsuggests that Gies and Walburn both believed that Ames \nlacked the ability to revamp the PREA program and \nadminister funds in a more proactive manner. See Smith \nv. Chrysler Corp., 155 F.3d 799, 807 (6th Cir. 1998) (noting \nthat \u201cthe employer must be able to establish its reasonable \nreliance on the particularized facts before it at the time the \ndecision was made\u201d). The testimony provided by DYS \nleadership supports the inference that they made a \n\u201creasonably informed and considered decision\u201d to demote \nAmes: Gies and Walburn both testified about the \nDepartment\u2019s vision for the role and the specific issues \nthey had with Ames\u2019s prior work performance (including \nher communication style and slow deployment of PREA \ngrant funds). Second, DYS argues that these concerns \ntruly did motivate the decision to remove Ames. The \npositive performance reviews Gies had written about \nAmes in 2011\u201313 do not demonstrate that the proffered \nexplanation is a post-hoc rationalization, according to \nDYS, because Gies later received negative feedback about \nAmes that undermined his earlier impression of her work. \n(See Memo. in Supp. at 32, ECF No. 72). And it certainly \nis true that impressions and attitudes regarding an \nemployee\u2019s work product and skills can shift over the \ncourse of six (6) years. \n \nNor is the fact that Stojsavljevic told other employees \nand his former supervisors that he wanted the PREA \nAdministrator job enough to create a genuine issue about \nwhether the valid business concerns set out by Gies and \nWalburn actually motivated their decision to remove \nAmes. There is little indication that they were aware of the \ncomments or of Stojsavljevic\u2019s interest. Ames suggests \nthat Sagle, who was friendly with Gies, went to Gies to \ninform him of Stojsavljevic\u2019s desire for the PREA \nAdministrator job, but Stojsavljevic claims that Sagle was \n\n37a \n \n \nnot receptive towards his expression of interest, told him \nto look elsewhere for a new job, and encouraged him to get \nmore PREA experience; Gies makes no mention of a \ndiscussion with Sagle (or with Groff) about Stojsavljevic as \na candidate for the PREA Administrator position, and \nneither Gies nor Walburn mentioned any awareness of \nStojsavljevic\u2019s comments leading up to their decision to \npromote him to PREA Administrator. In other words, \nthere is no genuine dispute that the record lacks evidence \nthat Stojsavljevic\u2019s comments had any influence on Gies \nand Walburn\u2014or that his interest in the job was the real \nmotivator behind their decision to revoke Ames\u2019s \nunclassified appointment. \n \nDYS asserts that the proffered reasoning was \nsufficient to motivate the demotion decision, by pointing \nout \nthat \nAmes \nhas \nfailed \nto \nadduce \nevidence \ndemonstrating that intentional discrimination was the \nactual motivating factor. (See id. at 33\u201336). Finally, DYS \nargues that Ames has failed to put forward \u201cevidence that \nemployees outside the protected class engaged in \n\u2018substantially identical conduct\u2019 and fared better than \n[she] did.\u201d Roseman v. Int\u2019l Union, United Auto., \nAerospace and Agric. Implement Workers of Am., No. 20-\n2151, 2021 WL 4931959, at *4 (6th Cir. July 14, 2021) \n(quoting Manzer v. Diamond Shamrock Chems. Co., 29 \nF.3d 1078, 1084 (6th Cir. 1994)). Ames testified as to seven \nindividuals that she believes were treated more favorably \nthan her.11 (See Memo. in Supp. at 34, ECF No. 71). But \nAmes has not provided evidence of how they have engaged \nin substantially identical conduct or have fared better than \nshe did; in fact, as DYS points out, Ames is unable to \n \n11 She mentions only three individuals, Frierson, Stojsavljevic, and \nTrim, in her opposition to DYS\u2019s motion for summary judgment. (Pl.\u2019s \nResp. at 9, ECF No. 72). \n\n38a \n \n \nestablish similarities with the individuals or explain how \nthey have been treated more favorably.12 \n \nThe same is true of Ames\u2019s attempts to demonstrate \npretext. She baldly asserts that the nondiscriminatory \nrationale proffered by DYS is overly vague, is \u201cprecisely \nthe sort of factually baseless justification that employers \nhave been using for years to justify their own bigotry and \ndiscrimination,\u201d and \u201cis unworthy of credence,\u201d but does \nnot provide any evidence that that is the case. (Pl.\u2019s Resp. \nat 9, ECF No. 72) (quoting Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing \nProd., Inc., 530 U.S. 133, 143 (2000) (internal citations \nomitted)). Under the McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting \nframework, \nonce \nan \nemployer \nhas \nprovided \na \nnondiscriminatory reason, the burden of production shifts \nback to the plaintiff, to show that the proffered reason is \npretextual \u2014 that it is without basis in fact, did not actually \nmotivate the decision, or was insufficient to motivate the \ndecision. See Burdine, 450 U.S. at 256\u201357 (noting that a \nTitle VII defendant need not \u201cpersuad[e] the court that it \nhad convincing objective reasons for preferring the chosen \napplicant above the plaintiff\u201d but must only \u201cproduce \nevidence \nof \nlegitimate \nnondiscriminatory \nreasons\u201d \n \n12 The seven individuals were: Ginine Trim, Yolonda Frierson, Nathan \nLawson, Chris Freeman, Jeff Spears, Kenya Brown, and Michael \nGarret. In the first instance, Ames did not work in the same divisions \nor under the same supervisors at DYS as Kenya Brown, Nathan \nLawson, or Chris Freeman. (Memo. in Supp. at 35\u201336, ECF No. 71). \nShe cannot show that Michael Garret received more favorable \ntreatment than her. (See id. at 35). Trim was her supervisor and was \nnot similarly situated. Her allegations about Frierson have been \ndiscussed already. And finally, she alleges that Spears received a cake \nand party by the gay supervisors on his 30th work anniversary, \nwhereas Ames did not receive cake or party for the same occasion, but \nis unable to name any of the supervisors who allegedly threw the \nparty. (See Ames Dep. 202:11\u201314, ECF No. 62). DYS suggests instead \nthat the party may actually have been to celebrate Spears\u2019 return to \nwork after some time away. (See id. at 203:15\u201324). \n\n39a \n \n \n(quoting Bd. of Trs. of Keene State Coll. v. Sweeney, 439 \nU.S. 24, 29 (1978) (Stevens, J., dissenting))). \n \nAmes has not done so here: she points to no facts in the \nrecord tending to suggest that the explanation is without \na factual basis, did not motivate the decision, or was \ninsufficient to do so; instead, she suggests only that \u201cthe \nother evidence of discrimination\u2014see the promotions of \nFrierson, Stojsavljevic, and Trim\u201d \u2014 demonstrate that the \nproffered rationale is not credible. (Pl.\u2019s Resp. at 9, ECF \nNo. 72). But the promotions of Frierson and Stojsavljevic \nare the alleged instances of discrimination made in this \ncase; they do not constitute stand-alone evidence of \ndiscrimination. See also Manzer, 29 F.3d at 1084 (holding \nthat a \u201cplaintiff may not rely simply upon his prima facie \nevidence but must, instead, introduce additional evidence \nof \nage \ndiscrimination\u201d \nto \nrebut \na \nproffered \nnondiscriminatory reason for the adverse employment \naction). As to the promotion of Trim, Ames has provided \nno proof that that employment decision was rooted in bias \nor discrimination, nor is it alleged in Ames\u2019s Complaint, \nAmended Complaint, or deposition testimony that Trim \nwas promoted because she is gay. (See generally Compl., \nECF No. 1; Am. Compl., ECF No. 28). To the contrary, \nAmes\u2019s assertion in her memo contra that Trim\u2019s \npromotion is \u201cevidence of discrimination\u201d is entirely \nunsupported by any citations to the record, detailed \nfactual allegations, or further explanation. Conclusory \nstatements without a factual basis are insufficient to \ncreate a genuine issue and withstand a motion for \nsummary judgment. \n \nIn short, Ames has failed to provide \u201cbackground \ncircumstances\u201d sufficient to establish a prima facie case of \nsexual orientation-based discrimination; she has also \nfailed to provide evidence creating a genuine dispute of \nmaterial fact as to whether Defendant DYS\u2019s proffered \n\n40a \n \n \nlegitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons for revoking her \nappointment as PREA Administrator was pretext. \nAccordingly, the Court GRANTS Defendant\u2019s Motion for \nSummary \nJudgment \n(ECF \nNo. \n71) \non \nAmes\u2019s \ndiscrimination claim about her demotion. \nIV.

(ECF No. 31). For \nthe following reasons, this Court GRANTS Defendant\u2019s \nMotion for Judgment on the Pleadings. (Id.). \nI. BACKGROUND \nA. Facts \nThis case arises from the alleged discrimination \nexperienced by Marlean Ames in her employment. (ECF \nNo. 28). Plaintiff alleges that such discrimination took \nplace on the basis of her gender, sexual preference, and \nage. (Id. at 1). Ames is a female who identifies as \nheterosexual and is over forty years old. (Id. at 2). Ames \nhas worked for the State of Ohio\u2019s Department of Youth \nServices (\u201cDYS\u201d) since 2004. (Id.). DYS is a state agency \nthat oversees the rehabilitation and confinement of \njuveniles in Ohio. (Id.). DYS hired Ames initially as an \nExecutive Secretary within the Parole Division. (Id.). \nAfter starting her tenure with DYS in Akron, Ames soon \ntransferred to the Indian River Juvenile Corrections \n\n43a \n \n \nFacility (\u201cIRJCF\u201d) in Massillon. (Id. at 3). There, she \nworked as an Executive Secretary for approximately four \nyears. (Id.). \nIn 2009, DYS offered Ames a new assignment as an \n\u201cAdministrative Assistant 2 or Program Administrator 2\u201d \nin its Central Office in Columbus. (Id.). There, Ames \nworked in this role just over five years. (Id.). After \nreceiving positive reviews and salary raises, DYS \npromoted Ames to Prison Rape Elimination Act \nAdministrator (\u201cPREAA\u201d) in 2014. (Id.). In May of 2017, \nGinine Trim became Ames\u2019s supervisor. (Id.). Trim is a \nfemale who identifies as a member of the Lesbian, Gay, \nBisexual, \nTransgender, \nIntersex, \nand \nQuestioning \n(\u201cLGBTIQ\u201d) community. (Id.). Trim made Ames aware \nthat she was a member of this community. (Id.). \nMeanwhile, DYS hired Alexander Stoksavljevic at \nIRJCF as a social worker. (Id.). Stoksavljevic is a male \nwho identifies as a member of the LGBTIQ community \nand was twenty-five in May of 2017. (Id.). In October of the \nsame year, DYS promoted Stoksavljevic to Client \nAdvocate/PREA Compliance Manager (\u201cPCM\u201d). (Id. at 4). \nNotably, because Stoksavljevic was still on probationary \nstatus, he was not eligible for this promotion. (Id.). To \ncircumvent this obstacle, the Superintendent of IRJCF \nsuggested that Stoksavljevic resign his current position so \nthat he may be hired as a PCM the following day. (Id.). \nAccording to Plaintiff, this conduct violated the agency\u2019s \nhiring processes. (Id.). Stoksavljevic then began pushing \nfor Plaintiff\u2019s position. (Id.). He told Trim\u2014in front of \nPlaintiff\u2014that Plaintiff should retire. (Id.). \nOn May 6, 2019, Trim paid Ames a visit at her desk. \n(Id.). After congratulating Ames for 30 years of public \nservice, Trim suggested that Ames retire. (Id.). \nAlternatively, Trim suggested, Ames should return to the \nAkron facility where she started her career with DYS. \n\n44a \n \n \n(Id.). Indeed, Trim encouraged Plaintiff to apply for the \nnow open position Stojsavljevic just left; this would result, \nhowever, in a significant pay reduction. (Id.). Plaintiff \nrebuffed both suggestions. (Id.). \nFour days later, Plaintiff was required to report to \nDirector Ryan Gies\u2019s conference room. (Id. at 4-5). There, \nHR Bureau Chief Robin Gee and Assistant Director of \nDYS Julie Walburn waited for Ames. (Id. at 5). Walburn \ntold Ames she was being demoted and transferred and \nthat she needed to sign an agreement reflecting such or \nrisk termination. (Id.). In response, Ames fled the room \ncrying. (Id.). Gee and Trim followed Ames and renewed \nWalburn\u2019s request. (Id.). Plaintiff relented, signed the \npaper agreeing to a demotion and transfer, and \ninvoluntarily vacated the premises. (Id.). Shortly \nthereafter, DYS required Plaintiff to report for her new \nposition at IRJCF. (Id.). On May 13, 2019, DYS hired \nStoksavljevic as a PREA\u2014the role Plaintiff held \nimmediately prior. (Id.). Further, DYS hired Stoksavljevic \ndespite being neither qualified nor having formally \napplied. (Id.). Further, Plaintiff alleges that this was not \nthe only instance of impropriety she faced. (See id. at 6). \nIn April 2019, Ames applied and interviewed for the \nrole of Bureau Chief of the Quality Assurance \nDepartment. (Id.). Despite being qualified and fulfilling \nthe application requirements, DYS declined to hire Ames, \nopting instead for Yolanda Frierson. (Id.). Frierson, a \nmember of the LGBTIQ community, is under forty years \nold. (Id.). Despite neither applying for the position when it \nwas originally posted nor being qualified, DYS selected \nFrierson instead of Ames. (Id.). \nFinally, Plaintiff alleges that DYS behaved improperly \nin other ways. Unlike when Plaintiff received her 30-year \nservice certificate, Jeffrey Spears\u2014a male who identifies \nas a member of the LGBTIQ community\u2014was thrown a \n\n45a \n \n \nparty replete with cake and published announcements by \nTrim \u201cand other gay supervisors.\u201d (Id.). Plaintiff \nmaintains that the all of the above events were motivative \nby Plaintiff\u2019s heterosexual preference, gender and age. \n(Id.). \nB.    Procedural \nOn April 20, 2020 the United States Equal \nEmployment \nOpportunity \nCommission \n(\u201cEEOC\u201d) \nreached a determination of probable cause and issued a 90-\nday right to sue letter on September 9, 2020. (ECF No.      \n1-2). On November 18, 2020, Plaintiff filed her initial \nComplaint against DYS. (ECF No. 1). Plaintiff alleged \neight causes of action under federal and state law arising \nfrom her employment with DYS. (Id.). Defendant \nAnswered (ECF No. 4), filed its first Motion for Judgment \non the Pleadings (ECF No. 11), before Plaintiff ultimately \nfiled her Amended Complaint on May 21, 2021. (ECF No. \n28). \nIn the Amended Complaint, Plaintiff also asserted \neight claims. (Id.). These causes of action include gender \nand sexual orientation discrimination under 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 2000e, et seq. (Title VII) (Count 1); Hostile work \nenvironment based on sexual orientation and age under \nTitle VII (Count 2); Retaliation under Title VII (Count 3); \nAge discrimination under 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 623, et seq. (ADEA) \n(Count 4); Fourteenth Amendment due process rights \nunder 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (Count 5); Age discrimination \nunder Ohio Rev. Code Chapter 4112 (Count 6); Gender \ndiscrimination under Ohio Rev. Code Chapter 4112 (Count \n7); and Hostile work environment under Ohio Rev. Code \nChapter 4112 (Count 8). Defendant timely filed its Answer. \n(ECF No. 29). \nOn June 23, 2021, Defendant filed its Motion for \nJudgment on the Pleadings. (ECF No. 31). Plaintiff timely \n\n46a \n \n \nfiled her Response (ECF No. 36), and Defendant timely \nfiled its Reply (ECF No. 37). This motion is now ripe for \nreview. \nII. \nSTANDARD OF REVIEW \nWhen a motion for judgment on the pleadings under \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(c) is based on the \nargument that the complaint fails to state a claim upon \nwhich relief may be granted, the Court employs the same \nlegal standard as a Rule 12(b)(6) motion. Morgan v. \nChurch\u2019s Fried Chicken, 829 F.2d 10, 11 (6th Cir. 1987) \n(\u201cWhere the Rule 12(b)(6) defense is raised by a Rule 12(c) \nmotion for judgment on the pleadings, we must apply the \nstandard for a Rule 12(b)(6) motion\u201d). The Court will grant \nthe Rule 12(c) motion \u201cwhen no material issue of fact exists \nand the party making the motion is entitled to judgment \nas a matter of law.\u201d JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. v. \nWinget, 510 F.3d 577, 582 (6th Cir. 2007) (internal \nquotation marks omitted). The Court must construe \u201call \nwell-pleaded material allegations of the pleadings of the \nopposing party . . . as true, and the motion may be granted \nonly if the moving party is nevertheless clearly entitled to \njudgment.\u201d Id. at 581 (internal quotation marks omitted). \nThe Court is not required, however, to accept as true mere \nlegal conclusions unsupported by factual allegations. \nAshcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009). \nIII. \nLAW & ANALYSIS \nDefendant moves for judgment on the pleadings on two \nbases: (1) the Court lacks subject-matter jurisdiction as to \nCounts 4 (ADEA), 6, 7, and 8 (the state law claims); and \n(2) Plaintiff fails to state a claim with regard to Counts 2 \n(Federal Hostile Work environment), 3 (Retaliation under \nTitle VII), and 5 (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983). The Court will address \neach argument in turn beginning with Defendant\u2019s \nargument against subject-matter jurisdiction. \n\n47a \n \n \nA. \nSubject-Matter Jurisdiction \n1. Count 4: ADEA \nDefendants argue that the Court lacks subject matter \njurisdiction over Plaintiff\u2019s claim brought under the Age \nDiscrimination in Employment Act (ADEA). (ECF No. 31 \nat 3). Relying on the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Kimel v. \nFla. Bd. of Regents, 528 U.S. 62, 92 (2000), Defendants \ncontend that Congress has not validly abrogated state \nimmunity under the ADEA. (Id.). Additionally, Defendant, \nrelying on Cameron v. Ohio, No. 2:06-CV-871, 2007 U.S. \nDist. LEXIS 76774, at *5-6 (S.D. Ohio Oct. 16, 2007), \nargues that the State of Ohio has not waived its immunity. \n(Id.). Accordingly, argues Defendant, this Court lacks \nsubject matter jurisdiction over this claim. (Id.). Plaintiff \nbegrudgingly concedes this argument. (ECF No. 36 at 2). \nAccordingly, Defendant\u2019s Motion on this basis is \nGRANTED. \n2. Counts 6, 7, 8: State Law Claims \n \nDefendant also argues that Counts 6, 7 and 8\u2014all \nalleged violations of Ohio Revised Code section 4112\u2014\ncannot be prosecuted in federal court. (ECF No. 31 at 4). \nDefendant, relying on Dendinger v. Ohio, contends that \nthe \u201cEleventh Amendment deprives federal courts of \njurisdiction\u201d regarding actions brought pursuant to Ohio \nrevised code chapter 4112. (Id.) (citing 207 F. App\u2019x 521, \n529 (6th Cir. 2006)). Moreover, according to Defendant, \nbecause the State of Ohio did not consent to being sued in \nfederal court under this state statute, this Court may not \nadjudicate these claims. (Id.). As such, Plaintiff\u2019s claims \nagainst DYS, a state administrative agency, pursued \nunder Ohio Revised Code section 4112 should be dismissed \nfor lack of subject matter jurisdiction. (Id.). \n \nPlaintiff responds that the authority cited by \nDefendant is persuasive rather than mandatory. (ECF \n\n48a \n \n \nNo. 36 at 2). Instead of conceding this claim outright, \nPlaintiff argues that the Court, if it finds it is without \njurisdiction, should transfer these claims \u201cto the Ohio \nCourt of Claims to determine whether immunity applies.\u201d \n(Id.). Plaintiff then argues that Ohio Revised Code \nSections 4112.02 and 2743.03 do not require that such suits \nbe exclusively brought in the Ohio Court of Claims. (Id. at \n3). This, Plaintiff says, is true despite her arguing that the \nstate waived its sovereign immunity as to such claims. \n(Id.). \n \nAs Plaintiff concedes, case law weighs heavily against \nher argument. Here, as in Robertson v. Rosol, \u201cPlaintiff[\u2019s] \nargument is not well taken.\u201d No. 2:06CV1087, 2007 WL \n2123764, at *4 (S.D. Ohio July 20, 2007); Donahoo v. Ohio \nDep\u2019t of Youth Servs., 237 F. Supp. 2d 844, 874 (N.D. Ohio \n2002) (District Court finding that it lacked subject matter \njurisdiction to hear Ohio state law claims under R.C. 4112). \nEven assuming, as Plaintiff argues, that the State of Ohio \nwaived its sovereign immunity as to claims under R.C. \n4112 et. seq., that does not give this Court subject matter \njurisdiction. Indeed, \u201ca State does not consent to suit in \nfederal court merely by consenting to suit in the courts of \nits own creation . . . [n]or . . . does it consent . . . by \nauthorizing suits against it \u201cin any court of competent \njurisdiction.\u201d \nColl. \nSav. \nBank \nv. \nFla. \nPrepaid \nPostsecondary Educ. Expense Bd., 527 U.S. 666, 676 \n(1999) (citing Smith v. Reeves, 178 U.S. 436, 441\u2013445 (1900) \nand Kennecott Copper Corp. v. State Tax Comm\u2019n, 327 \nU.S. 573, 577\u2013579 (1946)); see also Donahoo, 237 F. Supp. \n2d at 874 (finding \u201cState of Ohio has waived its immunity \nfrom suit and consented to having its liability determined \nby the state Court of Claims\u201d despite the federal court \nfinding it lacked jurisdiction). \n \nThus, even if the state courts of Ohio decide such \nactions do not need to be exclusively adjudicated in its \n\n49a \n \n \nCourt of Claims, that decision is neither this Court\u2019s \nconcern nor dispositive of the issue of whether this Court \nhas jurisdiction. Instead, it is \u201cthe State\u2019s Eleventh \nAmendment immunity that answers this question.\u201d Rosol, \n2007 WL 2123764, at *4 (citing Hall v. Med. Coll. of Ohio \nat Toledo, 742 F.2d 299, 301 (6th Cir. 1984)). Moreover, \nthis rule extends to that state\u2019s agencies. Puerto Rico \nAqueduct & Sewer Auth. v. Metcalf & Eddy, Inc., 506 U.S. \n139, 144 (1993) (\u201cAbsent waiver, neither a State nor \nagencies acting under its control may be subject to suit in \nfederal court.\u201d) (internal quotations omitted). Absent an \nexplicit waiver of that immunity\u2014and the Sixth Circuit \nheld in McCormick v. Miami University, 693 F.3d 654, \n664 (6th Cir. 2012) that Ohio has not invoked that waiver, \nthis Court has no power to hear this claim. \n \nAccordingly, Defendant\u2019s Motion for Judgment on the \nPleadings as to state law claims 6, 7 and 8 is GRANTED. \nB. Failure to State a Claim \n \nNext, Defendant argues that Plaintiff fails to state a \nclaim upon which relief can be granted with regard to \nCounts 2, 3, and 5. The Court addresses these arguments \nbeginning with Count 5, continuing with Count 3, and \nconcluding with Count 2. \n1. Count 5: Fourteenth Amendment Due Process Rights \nUnder 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 \n \nDefendant argues that Plaintiff\u2019s claim under section \n1983 fails because DYS is an improper defendant. (ECF \nNo. 31 at 4). Defendant, relying on Will v. Michigan Dept. \nof State Police, contends that a \u00a7 1983 claim is properly \nasserted against a \u201cperson\u201d acting under color of state law. \n(Id.) (citing 491 U.S. 58, 71). Because neither the state nor \nits officials acting in their official capacities are persons \nunder section 1983, Plaintiff\u2019s claim against DYS\u2014a state \nadministrative agency\u2014fails as a matter of law. (Id.). \n\n50a \n \n \nPlaintiff concedes this issue and requests that she be able \nto amend her complaint. (ECF No. 36 at 4). Because \nPlaintiff concedes this issue, the Court will not address \nwhether this claim would fail for another independent \nreason. (Id.). \n \nAccordingly, Defendant\u2019s Motion on this basis is \nGRANTED. \n2. Count 3: Retaliation under Title VII \n \nNext, Defendant contends that Plaintiff fails to allege \na necessary element of a Retaliation claim under Title VII. \n(ECF No. 31 at 5). Specifically, Defendant argues that \nPlaintiff failed to allege that she was engaging in a \nprotected activity as defined by that statute. (Id. at 6). \nIndeed, according to Defendant, such vague charges of \ndiscrimination are routinely rejected. (Id. at 7). \nAdditionally, Defendant argues that Plaintiff also fails to \ndemonstrate a causal connection between the alleged \nprotected activity and the alleged adverse employment \naction. (Id. at 8). According to Defendant, by Plaintiff's \nown words \u201cshe only refused to retire or accept a lesser \nposition when it was allegedly presented to her.\u201d (Id.). \nConsequently, \nDYS \nmade \nthe \nallegedly \nadverse \nemployment action before she engaged in the protected \nactivity. As such, her claim must fail. \n \nPlaintiff responds that Defendant mischaracterizes the \nissue. It was Plaintiff\u2019s resistance to discriminatory \nconduct that was protected by Title VII. (ECF No. 36 at \n5). As a result of her resistance, DYS demoted her. (Id. at \n6). In other words, Plaintiff insists there is a distinction \nbetween her supervisors demanding she voluntarily retire \nor take a lesser position and doing so involuntarily. (Id.). \nFurther, Plaintiff disputes that her allegations regarding \nthe causal connection between her resistance and her \ndemotion are clear. (See id.). Plaintiff reiterates that she \n\n51a \n \n \nwas punished by being forced to do something \ninvoluntarily that she would not do voluntarily. (Id. at 7). \nFor these reasons, she says Defendant\u2019s argument must \nfail. \n \nTo assert \u201ca prima facie case of retaliation under Title \nVII . . . the plaintiff bears the initial burden of establishing \nthat (1) [s]he . . . engaged in protected activity, (2) the \nemployer knew of the exercise of the protected right, \n(3) an adverse employment action was subsequently taken \nagainst the employee, and (4) there was a causal \nconnection between the protected activity and the adverse \nemployment action.\u201d Khalaf v. Ford Motor Co., 973 F.3d \n469, 488\u201389 (6th Cir. 2020), cert. denied, 141 S. Ct. 1743, \n209 L. Ed. 2d 508 (2021) (quoting Beard v. AAA of Mich., \n593 F. App\u2019x 447, 451 (6th Cir. 2014)). \n \nA plaintiff may satisfy the pleading requirement for \nprotected activity by \u201calleging conduct that falls within \none of two clauses in the statute, which says it is an: \nunlawful employment practice for an employer to \ndiscriminate against any of his employees . . . [1] \nbecause [the employee] has opposed any practice made \nan unlawful employment practice by this subchapter, \nor [2] because he has made a charge, testified, assisted, \nor participated in any manner in an investigation, \nproceeding, or hearing under this subchapter. \nHamade v. Valiant Gov\u2019t Servs., LLC, 807 F. App\u2019x 546, \n549 (6th Cir. 2020) (quoting 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e\u20133(a)). \nAccordingly, \u201c[t]he first clause is known as the \u201copposition \nclause,\u201d and the second as the \u201cparticipation clause.\u201d Id. \nThe opposition clause, of the two, is the more expansive \nroute. Specifically, \u201c[t]he Supreme Court has held that the \nterm \u201coppose\u201d should be interpreted based on its ordinary \nmeaning: \u201c[t]o resist or antagonize . . . ; to contend against; \nto confront; resist; withstand.\u201d Jackson v. Genesee Cty. \n\n52a \n \n \nRd. Comm\u2019n, 999 F.3d 333, 344 (6th Cir. 2021) (citing \nCrawford v. Metro. Gov\u2019t of Nashville & Davidson Cnty., \n555 U.S. 271, 276, 129 S.Ct. 846, 172 L.Ed.2d 650 (2009)). \nAdditionally, \u201c[e]xamples of opposition activity protected \nunder \nTitle \nVII \ninclude \ncomplaining \nto \nanyone \n(management, unions, other employees, or newspapers) \nabout allegedly unlawful practices; [and] refusing to obey \nan order because the worker thinks it is unlawful under \nTitle VII.\u201d Id. (citing Niswander v. Cincinnati Ins. Co., \n529 F.3d 714, 721 (6th Cir. 2008) (internal quotations \nomitted)). \n \nThat said, there are limits to what satisfies the \nopposition clause. And \u201c[w]hile the plaintiff\u2019s allegations of \nprotected activity do not need to be lodged with absolute \nformality, clarity, or precision, the plaintiff must allege \nmore than a vague charge of discrimination.\u201d Id. (citing \nYazdian v. ConMed Endoscopic Techs., Inc., 793 F.3d 634, \n645 (6th Cir. 2015)). Indeed, a Plaintiff must put the \ndefendant \u201con notice that her complaint concern[ed] \nstatutory rights.\u201d Brown v. VHS of Mich., Inc., 545 F. \nApp\u2019x 368, 373 (6th Cir. 2013). \n \nHere, Plaintiff attempts to plead this element by \nasserting that she resisted her supervisors\u2019 insistence that \nshe retire or accept a demotion on several occasions. When \na co-worker expressed to Plaintiff\u2019s supervisor that he \n\u201cwanted Plaintiff\u2019s job and that Plaintiff should retire,\u201d \nshe responded, in her words, by \u201ccontinu[ing] to resist and \nindicat[ing[ that she intended to work until she was 65 \nyears of age.\u201d On May 6, 2019, Plaintiff said \u201cno\u201d when her \nsupervisor suggested that she should retire or in the \nalternative, consider seeking a lower-paying position at a \ndifferent location. \n \nAlthough Plaintiff asserts that \u201cshe advised her \nsupervisors that demanded her to retire, or take a lesser \nposition, because of her gender, age and/or sexual \n\n53a \n \n \norientation was discriminatory,\u201d this allegation only \nappears in the Complaint as quoted above and not in the \nfactual allegation section. This is the precise type of \u201clegal \nconclusion couched as a factual allegation\u201d that this Court \n\u201cis not bound to accept as true.\u201d Long v. Insight Commc\u2019ns \nof Cent. Ohio, LLC, 804 F.3d 791, 794 (6th Cir. 2015) \n(quoting Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009). \n \nAlthough Plaintiff provides no authority for the \nproposition that either saying \u201cno,\u201d she intended to \ncontinue working until age 65, or asking why she was being \ndemoted constitutes opposition under Title VII, she urges \nthis Court to accept her view of the law. Although \nopposition is the more expansive pathway to satisfy the \nprotected activity requirement, vague resistance, much \nlike vague charges of discrimination, do not satisfy this \nelement. See Jackson, 999 F.3d at 344. \n \nTaken together, Plaintiff has neither pleaded activity \nunder the participation clause nor the opposition clause. \nBecause a failure to plead protected activity obviates the \nneed to consider whether Plaintiff adequately pled a \ncausal connection, this Court does not address that \nargument. As such, her Retaliation claim under Title VII \nis DISMISSED. \n3. Count 2: Hostile Work Environment \n \nFinally, Defendant argues that Plaintiff\u2019s claim for a \nHostile Work environment under Title VII similarly fails. \n(ECF No. 31 at 9). First, to the extent she attempts to \nassert a claim based on age, it fails because age is not a \nprotected class under Title VII.1 (Id. at 8). Secondly, \n \n1 This argument is mirrored for the Retaliation Claim under Title VII. \nBecause age is not a protected class under Title VII, to the extent \nPlaintiff attempts to assert an age-based claim, this claims fails. See \nCrawford v. Medina Gen. Hosp., 96 F.3d 830, 834 (6th Cir. 1996) (Title \n\n54a \n \n \nDefendant maintains that Plaintiff failed to allege any \ndiscriminatory behavior that constituted harassment. (Id. \nat 9). For example, the absence of a celebration for a \nworkplace milestone is simply not sufficient to support the \nconclusion that she worked in an abusive environment. \n(Id.). Even if she did feel unwelcome that is not enough to \nsupport the inference of severe or pervasive harassment. \n(Id. at 9\u201310). Furthermore, courts have dismissed such \nclaims when plaintiffs assert only a few instances of \nharassing or offensive behavior. (Id.) (citing Woodson v. \nHoliday Inn Express, No. 18-1468, 2018 WL 5008719, at \n*2) (6th Cir. Oct. 4, 2018)). Because Plaintiff\u2019s complaint \nfails to reference even one instance of harassing or \noffensive behavior due to her sex or sexual orientation,\u201d \nthis claim must fail. (ECF No. 37 at 5). \n \nPlaintiff responds by noting that denial of a promotion \nand a demotion is evidence of a hostile work environment. \n(ECF No. 36 at 7). Moreover, she insists that these actions \nwere motivated by her sexual orientation. (Id.). Plaintiff \nnotes that her superiors were \u201cfriends and supporters of \nthe LGBTIQ community.\u201d (Id. at 8). Importantly, \naccording to Plaintiff, people outside of this group were \nexcluded and unwelcome. (Id.). Plaintiff urges that this \nallegation can support her hostile work environment claim. \n(Id.). The Sixth Circuit has \u201cbroken this claim into five \nelements: \n(1) [The plaintiff] belonged to a protected group, (2) she \nwas subject to unwelcome harassment, (3) the \nharassment was based on [sex], (4) the harassment was \nsufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions \nof employment and create an abusive working \n \nVII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e et seq. (1988 ed. \nand Supp. V) (race, color, sex, national origin, and religion). \n\n55a \n \n \nenvironment, and (5) the defendant knew or should \nhave known about the harassment and failed to act. \nNathan v. Great Lakes Water Auth., 992 F.3d 557, 565  \n(6th Cir. 2021) (citations omitted). Further, \u201c[s]exual \nharassment in the workplace constitutes discrimination in \nviolation of these provisions [w]hen the workplace is \npermeated with discriminatory intimidation, ridicule, and \ninsult that is sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the \nconditions of the victim\u2019s employment and create an \nabusive working environment.\u201d Id. at 564 (citing Oncale v. \nSundowner Offshore Servs., 523 U.S. 75, 78 (1998)). \n\u201c[S]imple teasing, offhand comments, and isolated \nincidents (unless extremely serious) will not amount to \ndiscriminatory changes in the terms of employment.\u201d \nBrown v. Bd. of Educ. of Shelby Cty. Sch., 47 F. Supp. 3d \n665, 682\u201383 (W.D. Tenn. 2014)). \n \nThe Sixth Circuit has recognized three ways to \ndemonstrate that the harassment complained of was based \non sex or sexual orientation: \u201c(1) by showing that the \nharasser making sexual advances acted out of a sexual \ndesire; (2) by showing that the harasser was motivated by \ngeneral hostility to the presence of [women] in the \nworkplace; or (3) by offering \u201cdirect comparative evidence \nabout how the alleged harasser treated members of both \nsexes in a mixed-sex workplace.\u201d Kalich v. AT & T \nMobility, LLC, 679 F.3d 464, 471 (6th Cir. 2012) (citing \nVickers v. Fairfield Med. Ctr., 453 F.3d 757, 765 (6th Cir. \n2006) and Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Servs., Inc., 523 \nU.S. 75, 81 (1998)). \n \nHere, Plaintiff asserts that the constant demands for \nher to leave the office (by either retiring or taking another \nposition), among other things, are sufficient to allege a \nclaim of hostile work environment. Yet, despite Plaintiff\u2019s \ncharacterization of the demands for her to leave as being \nconstant, she only asserts two isolated incidents in her \n\n56a \n \n \nComplaint: one on May 6th and another on May 10th. The \nbalance of the \u201cdemands\u201d to leave were apparently \nperpetrated by a co-worker, Mr. Alexander Stojsavljevic. \nShe alleges that Stojsavljevic, in the presence of Plaintiff \nand her supervisor, made comments that \u201che wanted \nPlaintiff\u2019s job and that Plaintiff should retire.\u201d \n \nEven if the above could ever be sufficient to support a \nclaim of hostile work environment, Plaintiff has not \nadequately pled that this occurred because she is either a \nwoman or because she is heterosexual. Instead, she makes \nthe bald assertion that \u201cher heterosexual status caused \nher to be discriminated against by the LGBTIQ \ncommunity of supervisors and employees.\u201d To support her \nconclusion, Plaintiff further states that \u201c[o]thers outside of \nPlaintiff\u2019s protected groups were either not demoted or \ndid not receive such a significant decrease in their \ncompensation when moved to another position, or demoted \ndue to discipline.\u201d \n \nThis conclusory allegation does not allow the Court to \ninfer that complained of acts took place because of either \nher sex or sexual orientation. Even taking all of her factual \nassertions as true, the fact that some of her colleagues \nwere rude to her (the man claiming that he wanted her job \nand that she should retire), did not throw her appreciation \nparties, or pressured her to retire or be transferred is not \nindicative of gender-based or sexual-orientation based \nbias. Moreover, her conclusory claims that these instances \nwere motivated by such bias are without support. Instead, \nit appears that Plaintiff in presenting a collection of loosely \nrelated data points, expects this Court to draw the \nconclusion she did: that her colleagues singled her out \nbecause she was a heterosexual woman. But there is a \nsizable gap between what she has alleged and a cognizable \nclaim \nof \ngender \nor \nsexual \norientation-based \ndiscrimination. \n\n57a \n \n \n \nBecause she fails to allege an essential element of the \nhostile work environment cause of action\u2014that the \nharassment she experienced was based on sex or sexual \norientation\u2014her claim necessarily fails and this claim is \nDISMISSED. \nIV.

          "task_beliefs": "My initial belief state was one of complete uncertainty regarding the legal facts and arguments of *Ames v. Ohio Department of Youth Services*. This observation has provided a foundational structure for the legal question at hand. I now understand that this case is not just a generic discrimination claim, but specifically a \"reverse discrimination\" case brought under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The central legal dispute revolves around the proper application of the *McDonnell Douglas* burden-shifting framework, a key judicial test in employment discrimination law. The specific point of contention is whether a plaintiff from a majority group (in this instance, a heterosexual person alleging discrimination based on sexual orientation) must satisfy a heightened requirement of showing \"background circumstances\" to establish a prima facie case. This clarifies that the core of the case is about the procedural hurdles a plaintiff must clear at the initial stage of litigation, not necessarily the ultimate merits of the discrimination claim itself. My uncertainty about the specific precedents each side will use remains high, but the legal battleground has been clearly defined.",
          "design_beliefs": "My initial belief state was one of complete uncertainty about effective strategies for predicting Supreme Court outcomes. This observation provides a powerful initial heuristic for information gathering in this domain. A highly effective opening strategy is to identify and prioritize the foundational documents that frame the case for the Supreme Court. The agent's reasoning correctly identifies the **Petition for a Writ of Certiorari** as the single most valuable initial document. This is because it contains the petitioner's own articulation of the legal question, the arguments for why the lower court erred, and, crucially, the assertion of a \"circuit split\" (where different federal appellate courts have conflicting rules on the same legal issue), which is a primary motivator for the Supreme Court to take a case. This confirms the strategy: **to maximize initial information gain for task-specific parameters (\u03b8), begin by analyzing the cert petition.** Concurrently, a robust strategy involves mapping out the broader jurisprudential context, including the current Court's leanings on statutory interpretation (e.g., textualism vs. purposivism), its treatment of judge-made frameworks like *McDonnell Douglas*, and the influence of external actors like the Solicitor General. This two-pronged approach\u2014starting with the specific case's foundational document while planning for a broader analysis of the Court's methods\u2014is now my primary design principle."

        "current_beliefs": {
          "task_beliefs": "My understanding of *Ames v. Ohio Department of Youth Services* has sharpened considerably. I previously identified the case as a \"reverse discrimination\" claim under Title VII, centered on the *McDonnell Douglas* framework's \"background circumstances\" requirement for majority plaintiffs. The petition for certiorari has now provided the precise legal architecture of the petitioner's case.\n\nThe \"Question Presented\" is now known verbatim: \"Whether, in addition to pleading the other elements of Title VII, a majority-group plaintiff must show 'background circumstances to support the suspicion that the defendant is that unusual employer who discriminates against the majority.'\" This confirms the legal issue is purely about the prima facie stage of litigation.\n\nCrucially, the petition substantiates the existence of a deep and acknowledged circuit split, which dramatically increases my assessment of the likelihood of certiorari being granted. I now have a specific map of this split:\n*   **Circuits Requiring \"Background Circumstances\":** D.C., Sixth, Seventh, Eighth, and Tenth.\n*   **Circuits Explicitly Rejecting the Requirement:** Third and Eleventh.\n*   **Circuits Not Applying the Rule:** First, Second, Fourth, Fifth, and Ninth.\n\nThe petitioner's strategy for overturning the Sixth Circuit's decision rests on three core arguments:\n1.  **The Rule is Incorrect:** This is the primary merits argument, which itself is threefold:\n    *   **Textual:** The rule imposes a burden on majority plaintiffs not found in the text of Title VII, which protects \"any individual.\" This argument is explicitly framed to appeal to textualist justices, drawing parallels to recent landmark cases like *Bostock v. Clayton Cnty.* and *Groff v. DeJoy*.\n    *   **Precedent:** The rule conflicts with *McDonald v. Santa Fe Trail Transp. Co.*, which affirmed Title VII's protections for all races, and distorts the flexible *McDonnell Douglas* framework.\n    *   **Practical:** The rule is \"administratively unwieldy\" and difficult for lower courts to apply consistently.\n2.  **The Entrenched Circuit Split:** The petition argues that the disagreement among the circuits is persistent and requires the Court's intervention for uniformity in federal law.\n3.  **Ideal Vehicle:** The case is presented as a perfect opportunity to resolve the question because the \"background circumstances\" rule was the sole, dispositive reason for the dismissal of Ames's sexual orientation claim at summary judgment. The petition highlights a concurring opinion from Sixth Circuit Judge Kethledge that criticizes the rule and essentially invites Supreme Court review, a powerful signal.\n\nMy understanding of the case's factual posture is also more refined. The petitioner emphasizes that she was a long-serving, well-reviewed employee who was demoted and passed over for promotion in favor of two less-qualified gay individuals, for whom the employer had to \"circumvent its own internal procedures.\" This narrative is designed to portray the \"background circumstances\" test as a procedural roadblock to a potentially meritorious claim. My confidence that the Court will grant certiorari is now high. My prediction on the merits is now leaning strongly toward reversal, as the petitioner's textualist argument appears well-aligned with the current Court's majority interpretive methodology.",
          "design_beliefs": "My initial design principle\u2014that the most effective opening strategy is to analyze the petition for a writ of certiorari\u2014has been overwhelmingly validated by this observation. The petition provided a complete roadmap of the case's legal arguments, procedural history, and its primary appeal to the Court (the circuit split). My methodology has evolved with several new, more specific heuristics:\n\n1.  **Prioritize Key Sections of the Cert Petition:** While the whole document is valuable, the \"Question Presented,\" \"Reasons for Granting the Petition,\" and \"Table of Authorities\" are the highest-yield sections for rapid, foundational understanding. This allows for a quick grasp of the core legal issue, the strategic arguments, and the key precedents in play.\n2.  **Actively Seek Signals from Lower Court Opinions:** The petitioner's strategic use of Judge Kethledge's concurrence highlights a new heuristic: always search for and analyze separate concurrences or dissents in the lower court ruling. A judge writing separately to critique binding circuit precedent is a strong signal that an issue is \"ripe\" for Supreme Court review and may even provide a ready-made argument for reversal.\n3.  **Assess the \"Vehicle\" Quality:** A successful petition must not only present an important question but also argue that the current case is a \"clean vehicle\" to decide it. My design process must now include an explicit step to evaluate this claim: Was the legal issue dispositive? Are the facts uncomplicated? Is the record well-developed? This helps predict not just if the Court *wants* to answer the question, but if they can answer it *in this case*.\n4.  **Map Arguments to Judicial Philosophy:** The petitioner's choice to lead with a textualist argument (\"a deep scratch across its surface\") and cite *Bostock* and *Groff* confirms the importance of not just identifying legal arguments, but mapping them to the known judicial philosophies of the sitting justices. Predicting the outcome requires understanding which arguments will resonate with which members of the Court. My strategy must now include categorizing arguments (e.g., textualist, originalist, purposivist, pragmatic) and assessing their likely reception. This moves the analysis from legal summary to predictive modeling."

Title VII\u2019s pro-\ntections apply equally to everyone.  They apply with \nthe same force to members of minority and majority \ngroups.  McDonald v. Santa Fe Trail Transp. Co., \n427 U.S. 273, 278\u201379 (1976).  The Petition argues \nthat the circuits use differing approaches for majori-\nty- and minority-group plaintiffs for one subpart of \none step of one approach to evaluating employment-\ndiscrimination claims.  The Question Presented nev-\ner gets off the ground: Ames did not question the Cir-\ncuit\u2019s longstanding approach to the Question Pre-\nsented until this Court and, not only does the Ques-\ntion Presented does not make a difference to the out-\ncome of this case, it rarely makes a difference in any \ncase. \nPetitioner Marlean Ames never challenged the \nSixth Circuit\u2019s application of the so-called \u201cback-\nground circumstances\u201d approach to Title VII discrim-\nination claims for majority-group plaintiffs.  Her only \nargument below was that she had satisfied that re-\nquirement.  Ames should not be able to raise an ar-\ngument here that she never aired in the courts be-\nlow.  Ames\u2019s failure bears directly on this Court\u2019s re-\nview.  The Sixth Circuit has taken a nuanced ap-\nproach to the background circumstances element\u2014\nbut none of that nuance was relevant in light of the \nway that Ames presented her appeal.  Furthermore, \nat least two Sixth Circuit judges have indicated that \nthey view Students for Fair Admissions v. President \n& Fellows of Harvard College, 600 U.S. 181 (2023) as \n\n2 \n \nresetting the table for the Circuit\u2019s Title VII prece-\ndent, and would rule that way if the issue were \nproperly preserved.  See Smyer v. Kroger Ltd. P\u2019ship \nI, No. 22-3692, 2024 WL 1007116, at *8 (6th Cir. \nMar. 8, 2024) (Boggs, J., concurring); id. at *10 \n(Readler, J., concurring) (also noting that Ames did \nnot raise the Harvard decision). \nWhat is more, answering the Question Presented \nwill not change the outcome here.  Ames challenged \ntwo separate employment actions in the courts be-\nlow: the Department of Youth Services\u2019 failure to \npromote her and its decision to demote her and re-\nplace her with another employee.   \nThe Sixth Circuit held that Ames\u2019s demotion \nclaim failed at a later step of the familiar three-step \napproach to evaluating discrimination claims (see \nMcDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792 \n(1973)).  That employment decision, it held, involved \nno discriminatory motive.  Ames\u2019s Question Present-\ned does not challenge that aspect of the Sixth Cir-\ncuit\u2019s decision and she therefore can no longer chal-\nlenge the Sixth Circuit\u2019s conclusion that the demo-\ntion about which Ames complains was not discrimi-\nnatory.   \nAs for her promotion claim, Ames has affirmative-\nly waived any challenge to the requirement that she \nestablish a prima facie case of discrimination more \ngenerally.  See Pet.28 n.3.  And because she failed to \nintroduce any evidence that the decisionmakers who \nmade the employment decision that she challenges \nknew of her majority-group status (in this case her \nsexual orientation), Ames\u2019s promotion claim would \nhave failed at the prima facie stage even if the Sixth \nCircuit had not used the legal framework Ames chal-\n\n3 \n \nlenges.  What is more, Ames\u2019s claim that she was not \npromoted would also have failed at the next step of \nMcDonnell Douglas\u2019s analysis.  The Department had \nlegitimate, nondiscriminatory, reasons for hiring \nsomeone other than Ames, and Ames has not pointed \nto sufficient evidence to create a genuine issue of fact \nabout whether those reasons were pretextual.   \nEven without these vehicle flaws, the Court \nshould decline review.  Any divergence in how the \ncircuits approach the Question Presented is more \nform than substance; regardless of how each circuit \nspecifically describes its approach to the Question \nPresented, each circuit is focused on the same under-\nlying question.  Every circuit discussed in the Peti-\ntion asks, in one way or another, whether a plaintiff \nhas shown that an employer\u2019s actions, \u201c\u2018if otherwise \nunexplained,\u201d are \u201cmore likely than not based on the \nconsideration of impermissible factors.\u2019\u201d  Tex. Dep\u2019t of \nCmty. Affairs v. Burdine, 450 U.S. 248, 254 (1981) \n(quoting Furnco Constr. Corp. v. Waters, 438 U.S. \n567, 577 (1978)).  Put another way, all the circuits \nare ultimately trained on the question of what\u2014if \nanything\u2014gives rise to an inference that the plaintiff \nis the minority or the outsider in the context of the \nspecific employment decision the lawsuit challenges.  \nFinally, any difference between the circuits, whether \nin language or substance, arose decades ago.  Despite \nthe longevity of any substantive difference, the cir-\ncuit\u2019s varying formulations rarely, if ever change liti-\ngation outcomes.   \nSTATEMENT \nMarlean Ames worked for the Ohio Department \nof Youth Services in a variety of roles.  Pet.App3a.  \nShe was working as the Administrator of the De-\n\n4 \n \npartment\u2019s Prison Rape Elimination Act program \nwhen the Department created a new position, the \nBureau Chief of Quality Assurance and Improve-\nment.  Pet.App.18a.  Ames applied for the new posi-\ntion.  Id. \nThe Bureau Chief position was a management \nrole that was intended to supervise and guide the \nother members of the Office of Quality and Im-\nprovement.  Pet.App.19a.  Among the key skills that \nthe Department was looking for in a successful can-\ndidate were management, supervision, and workforce \nplanning.  Id.  Ames was one of three people who ap-\nplied for the Bureau Chief job.  Id.  None of them \nwere hired.  Pet.App.20a.  Because there was no \ntimeline for filling the position, the Department de-\ncided to wait to hire someone until an ideal candidate \ncould be found.  Id.   \nSix months after Ames had interviewed for the \nBureau Chief role, the Department hired Yolanda \nFrierson for the job.  Pet.App.20a.  Julie Walburn, \nthe assistant director of the Department, made the \ndecision to hire Frierson.  See Pet.App.18a, 20a\u201321a.  \nAlthough Frierson did not interview for the Bureau \nChief job, Walburn had worked with Frierson in the \npast.  Pet.App.21a.  Walburn felt that Frierson would \nbe a good fit for the role because, among other things, \nFrierson had significant management experience.  \nId.  Although Frierson and Ames were both women, \nFrierson, unlike Ames, was gay.  Id. \nNot long after Ames interviewed for the Bureau \nChief position, she was removed from her role admin-\nistering the Prison Rape Elimination Act program.  \nPet.App.4a.  When the Governor appointed a new Di-\nrector of the Department, he had stressed to that Di-\n\n5 \n \nrector, Ryan Gies, that addressing sexual victimiza-\ntion within the juvenile corrections system was a \nhigh priority.  See Pet.App.18a, 21a\u201322a.  Gies there-\nfore began restructuring the Department\u2019s programs.  \nPet.App.21a\u201322a.   \nIt was that restructuring that cost Ames her posi-\ntion.  Pet.App.22a.  Gies felt that Ames was difficult \nto work with.  Id.  And Walburn was concerned that \nAmes could not oversee a more proactive approach to \ncomplying with the Prison Rape Elimination Act.  Id.  \nAmes was reassigned to a different role within the \nDepartment, one that she had previously held and \nthat paid less, Pet.App.18a, and Alex Stojsavljevic \nwas selected to oversee the Prison Rape Elimination \nAct program, Pet.App.23a.  Stojsavljevic is a gay \nman.  See id. \nAmes filed a complaint with the Equal Opportuni-\nty Commission and received a right-to-sue letter.  \nPet.App.4a.  Ames then filed a complaint in federal \ndistrict court.  Id.  As is relevant here, Ames\u2019s com-\nplaint alleged that the Department discriminated \nagainst her on the basis of sexual orientation (which \nis a form of sex discrimination) when it hired Fri-\nerson for the Bureau Chief role (call this her \u201cpromo-\ntion claim\u201d) and that it discriminated against her on \nthe basis of both sex and sexual orientation when it \ndemoted her and replaced her with Stojsavljevic (call \nthis her \u201cdemotion claim\u201d).  Pet.App.5a, 6a.  The dis-\ntrict court granted summary judgment in the De-\npartment\u2019s favor on both claims, see Pet.App.33a, \n39a\u201340a, and the Sixth Circuit affirmed, Pet.App.3a. \nAmes\u2019s claim related to the Bureau Chief position \nfailed, the Sixth Circuit held, because Ames could not \nmake \na \nprima \nfacie \ncase \nof \ndiscrimination.  \n\n6 \n \nPet.App.5a\u20136a.  Under Sixth Circuit precedent, a \nmajority-group plaintiff like Ames must identify evi-\ndence that would \u201csupport the suspicion that the de-\nfendant is that unusual employer who discriminates \nagainst the majority.\u201d  Pet.App.5a (quoting Arendale \nv. City of Memphis, 519 F.3d 587, 603 (6th Cir. \n2008)).  Ames, the Sixth Circuit held, had not.  \nPet.App.5a\u20136a.  Ames conceded in the district court \nthat Walburn and Gies, neither of whom are gay, \nwere the ones who were responsible for hiring Fri-\nerson. see Opposition to Motion for Summary Judg-\nment, R.72, PageID#2488 n.1.  Ames attempted to \nwalk back that admission on appeal.  She argued in \nthe Sixth Circuit that she had demonstrated back-\nground circumstances of discrimination because a \ndifferent individual made the decision to hire Fri-\nerson and that individual was gay.  See Pet.App.6a.  \nThe Sixth Circuit held, however, that Ames\u2019s conces-\nsion in the district court meant that she had forfeited \nthat argument for purposes of appeal.  Id.   \nThe Sixth Circuit held that Ames\u2019s demotion \nclaim failed for the same reason, at least to the ex-\ntent that Ames alleged that the Department discrim-\ninated against her on the basis of her sexual orienta-\ntion when it replaced her with Stojsavljevic.  See \nPet.App.6a.  But because Ames had also alleged that \nthe Department discriminated against her on the ba-\nsis of sex when it demoted her and selected a man to \nfill her prior position, the Sixth Circuit considered \nthe Department\u2019s proffered reasons for that employ-\nment action.  Pet.App.6a\u20139a.  It held that Ames \nfailed to carry her burden of showing that the De-\npartment discriminated against her.  Id.  The De-\npartment, the Sixth Circuit held, had legitimate, \nnondiscriminatory, reasons for demoting Ames and \n\n7 \n \nhiring Stojsavljevic and Ames failed to introduce any \nevidence that would suggest that those reasons were \npretextual.  See id. \nJudge Kethledge concurred.  Although he joined \nthe opinion in full, he wrote that he disagreed with \nSixth Circuit precedent to the extent that it required \nAmes to show, as part of her prima facie case of sex-\nual-orientation discrimination, that the Department \n\u201cis the unusual employer that discriminates against \nthe majority.\u201d  Pet.App.9a (quotation omitted). \nAmes has now filed a petition for a writ of certio-\nrari in which she challenges the Sixth Circuit\u2019s prec-\nedent, which includes a \u201cbackground circumstances\u201d \ncomponent for employment-discrimination claims to \nproceed down the McDonnell Douglas path if the \nplaintiff is a member of a majority group.  That prec-\nedent required her to point to something that indi-\ncated that the Department was the unusual employ-\ner that discriminates against the majority.  See Pet.i.  \nBut the Question Presented does not challenge the \nportion of the Sixth Circuit\u2019s decision that held that \nthe Department had legitimate, nondiscriminatory \nreasons for demoting Ames and replacing her with \nStojsavljevic.  See, generally, Pet.   \nREASONS FOR DENYING THE PETITION \nI. \nThis case provides a poor vehicle with \nwhich to address the Question Presented. \nThis case has numerous vehicle problems that \nmake it a poor case in which to consider the Question \nPresented.  Any one of those problems provides a \nreason to deny Ames\u2019s petition for a writ of certiorari. \nThe context for these vehicle flaws includes both \nlegal and factual background. \n\n8 \n \nLegally, these flaws intersect with this Court\u2019s \nfrequently invoked tool for assessing discrimination \nclaims in McDonnell Douglas.  All Title VII plaintiffs, \nregardless of the group to which they belong, bear \nthe \u201cultimate burden of persuading the trier of fact \nthat \nthe \ndefendant \nintentionally \ndiscriminated \nagainst\u201d them.  Burdine, 450 U.S. at 253.  The Court \nin McDonnell Douglas adopted a three-step analysis \nto assist courts in reviewing Title VII claims.  At the \nfirst step, a plaintiff bears the burden of establishing \na prima facie case of discrimination.  411 U.S. at 802.  \nOnce she does so, the employer must offer a legiti-\nmate, nondiscriminatory, reason for its actions.  Id. \nat 802\u201303. The plaintiff then bears the burden of \nshowing that the employer\u2019s reasons were pretextual.  \nId. at 804.  McDonnell Douglas\u2019s test was \u201cnever in-\ntended to be rigid, mechanized, or ritualistic,\u201d how-\never; it was simply intended to be \u201ca sensible, orderly \nway to evaluate the evidence in light of common ex-\nperience as it bears on the critical question of dis-\ncrimination.\u201d  Furnco Constr. Corp. v. Waters, 438 \nU.S. 567, 577 (1978). \nFactually, these flaws intersect with Ames\u2019s two \nclaimed acts of employment discrimination.  Recall \nthat she initially challenged both the Department\u2019s \ndecision to promote a different person and the De-\npartment\u2019s decision to demote her when it picked a \ndifferent person to fill Ames\u2019s former role.  Ames \nchallenged the promotion decision as illegal sexual-\norientation discrimination and challenged the demo-\ntion decision as both illegal sex and sexual-\norientation discrimination.  And while the Sixth Cir-\ncuit affirmed judgment against Ames on her orienta-\ntion theories for failing the prima facie inquiry with \nrespect to both her promotion and demotion claims, it \n\n9 \n \naffirmed \njudgment \nagainst \nher \non \nthe \nsex-\ndiscrimination theory because Ames could not show \nany pretext in the Department\u2019s decision to demote \nher and to select someone to replace her at her for-\nmer position.  See Pet.App.7a\u20138a.  The Sixth Circuit, \nthat is, rejected Ames\u2019s claim that the Department \ndiscriminated against her when it demoted her.   \nIn this Court, Ames\u2019s Question Presented targets \nonly a component of the prima facie showing.  The \nconsequence of that choice is that Ames cannot chal-\nlenge the Department\u2019s decision to demote her be-\ncause she has not challenged the lower court\u2019s hold-\nings that the demotion decision involved no pretext \n(and thus no discrimination).    \nWith that legal and factual setting, the following \nfour vehicle flaws point against granting review. \nA. \nAmes did not challenge the Sixth \nCircuit\u2019s prima facie test below. \nAmes never challenged the Sixth Circuit\u2019s \u201cback-\nground circumstances\u201d element below.  She argued \ninstead that she satisfied that requirement.  While \nAmes\u2019s litigation strategy may not have forfeited her \nQuestion Presented in the strictest sense, it still \nmakes this case a poor vehicle with which to consider \nthat question. \nThe Court has indicated that parties need not al-\nways raise their arguments for the first time in the \ncircuit courts.  It has noted that there is no require-\nment that a \u201cparty demand overruling of a squarely \napplicable, recent circuit precedent, even though that \nprecedent was established in a case to which the par-\nty itself was privy and over the party\u2019s vigorous ob-\njection.\u201d  United States v. Williams, 504 U.S. 36, 44 \n\n10 \n \n(1992); see also United States v. Vonn, 535 U.S. 55, \n58 (2002).   \nEven if Ames was not required to challenge exist-\ning Sixth Circuit precedent, she at least should not \nbe able to benefit from her failure to do so.  But that, \nin effect, is what she seeks to do.  As discussed in \nmore detail below, the Sixth Circuit has taken a nu-\nanced approach to determining whether a majority-\ngroup plaintiff has identified background circum-\nstances that suggest discrimination.  See below at \n23\u201324, 33\u201335.  Among other things, it has held that \nthe \u201c[background circumstances] requirement is not \nonerous, and can be met through a variety of means.\u201d  \nJohnson v. Metro. Gov\u2019t of Nashville & Davidson \nCnty., 502 F. App\u2019x 523, 536 (6th Cir. 2012).  Had \nAmes argued that such a requirement is inconsistent \nwith Title VII, then the Sixth Circuit would have had \nthe opportunity to discuss its precedent in greater \ndetail.  It could have explained, for example, that the \n\u201cbackground circumstances\u201d requirement is not a \nhigher burden, merely a different one.  But because \nAmes did not raise that issue, the panel had no rea-\nson to reject her framing of the background circum-\nstances element of the prima\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

See McDonnell Doug-\nlas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792 (1973).  Did the \nSixth Circuit err when, in using that rubric, it re-\nquired a discrimination plaintiff to provide some evi-\ndence that the employer had a discriminatory motive \nas part of the prima facie showing?   \n\nii \n \nLIST OF DIRECTLY RELATED PROCEEDINGS \nThe petition\u2019s list of related proceedings is com-\nplete and correct.   \n\niii \n \nTABLE OF CONTENTS \nPage \nQUESTION PRESENTED .......................................... i \nLIST \nOF \nDIRECTLY \nRELATED \nPROCEEDINGS ......................................................... ii \nTABLE OF CONTENTS ........................................... iii \nTABLE OF AUTHORITIES ....................................... v \nINTRODUCTION ....................................................... 1 \nSTATEMENT .............................................................. 3 \nREASONS FOR DENYING THE PETITION ........... 7 \nI. \nThis case provides a poor vehicle with \nwhich \nto \naddress \nthe \nQuestion \nPresented. ...................................................... 7 \nA. Ames did not challenge the Sixth \nCircuit\u2019s prima facie test below. .............. 9 \nB. Answering the Question Presented in \nAmes\u2019s favor would not change the \noutcome in this case because Ames \ncannot satisfy a separate component \nof the prima facie showing. .................... 11 \nC. Even if Ames could establish a prima \nfacie case of discrimination, the \noutcome of this case still would not \nchange. .................................................... 13 \nD. Ames fails to distinguish between the \nportion of the Sixth Circuit\u2019s decision \nthat she has challenged and the \nportion that she has not. ........................ 16 \n\niv \n \nII. \nThere is no meaningful circuit split; the \ndifferences between the circuits are \nlargely differences in language not law. ..... 17 \nA. This Court\u2019s precedent instructs that \nthe McDonnell Douglas test is a \nflexible one. ............................................. 18 \nB. There is no meaningful disagreement \nbetween the circuits about the \nultimate legal standard that \nMcDonnell Douglas established. ........... 21 \n1. In \u201creverse\u201d discrimination cases, the \nSixth, Seventh, Eighth, Tenth, and \nD.C. Circuits describe the prima facie \ncase\u2019s first step as a showing about \nbackground circumstances. ...................... 22 \n2. The Third and Eleventh Circuits are in \naccord with the other circuits. .................. 25 \n3. The First, Second, Fourth, Fifth, and \nNinth Circuits apply a largely similar \nprima facie standard. ................................ 28 \nC. District court uncertainty is not a \nreason to grant Ames\u2019s petition for a \nwrit of certiorari. .................................... 32 \nIII. The Sixth Circuit faithfully applied this \nCourt\u2019s precedent when it held that \nAmes had not made out a prima facie \ncase of discrimination. ................................. 32 \nCONCLUSION .......................................................... 35 \n \n\nv \n \nTABLE OF AUTHORITIES \nPage(s) \nCases \nArendale v.

Title VII\u2019s pro-\ntections apply equally to everyone.  They apply with \nthe same force to members of minority and majority \ngroups.  McDonald v. Santa Fe Trail Transp. Co., \n427 U.S. 273, 278\u201379 (1976).  The Petition argues \nthat the circuits use differing approaches for majori-\nty- and minority-group plaintiffs for one subpart of \none step of one approach to evaluating employment-\ndiscrimination claims.  The Question Presented nev-\ner gets off the ground: Ames did not question the Cir-\ncuit\u2019s longstanding approach to the Question Pre-\nsented until this Court and, not only does the Ques-\ntion Presented does not make a difference to the out-\ncome of this case, it rarely makes a difference in any \ncase. \nPetitioner Marlean Ames never challenged the \nSixth Circuit\u2019s application of the so-called \u201cback-\nground circumstances\u201d approach to Title VII discrim-\nination claims for majority-group plaintiffs.  Her only \nargument below was that she had satisfied that re-\nquirement.  Ames should not be able to raise an ar-\ngument here that she never aired in the courts be-\nlow.  Ames\u2019s failure bears directly on this Court\u2019s re-\nview.  The Sixth Circuit has taken a nuanced ap-\nproach to the background circumstances element\u2014\nbut none of that nuance was relevant in light of the \nway that Ames presented her appeal.  Furthermore, \nat least two Sixth Circuit judges have indicated that \nthey view Students for Fair Admissions v. President \n& Fellows of Harvard College, 600 U.S. 181 (2023) as \n\n2 \n \nresetting the table for the Circuit\u2019s Title VII prece-\ndent, and would rule that way if the issue were \nproperly preserved.  See Smyer v. Kroger Ltd. P\u2019ship \nI, No. 22-3692, 2024 WL 1007116, at *8 (6th Cir. \nMar. 8, 2024) (Boggs, J., concurring); id. at *10 \n(Readler, J., concurring) (also noting that Ames did \nnot raise the Harvard decision). \nWhat is more, answering the Question Presented \nwill not change the outcome here.  Ames challenged \ntwo separate employment actions in the courts be-\nlow: the Department of Youth Services\u2019 failure to \npromote her and its decision to demote her and re-\nplace her with another employee.   \nThe Sixth Circuit held that Ames\u2019s demotion \nclaim failed at a later step of the familiar three-step \napproach to evaluating discrimination claims (see \nMcDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792 \n(1973)).  That employment decision, it held, involved \nno discriminatory motive.  Ames\u2019s Question Present-\ned does not challenge that aspect of the Sixth Cir-\ncuit\u2019s decision and she therefore can no longer chal-\nlenge the Sixth Circuit\u2019s conclusion that the demo-\ntion about which Ames complains was not discrimi-\nnatory.   \nAs for her promotion claim, Ames has affirmative-\nly waived any challenge to the requirement that she \nestablish a prima facie case of discrimination more \ngenerally.  See Pet.28 n.3.  And because she failed to \nintroduce any evidence that the decisionmakers who \nmade the employment decision that she challenges \nknew of her majority-group status (in this case her \nsexual orientation), Ames\u2019s promotion claim would \nhave failed at the prima facie stage even if the Sixth \nCircuit had not used the legal framework Ames chal-\n\n3 \n \nlenges.  What is more, Ames\u2019s claim that she was not \npromoted would also have failed at the next step of \nMcDonnell Douglas\u2019s analysis.  The Department had \nlegitimate, nondiscriminatory, reasons for hiring \nsomeone other than Ames, and Ames has not pointed \nto sufficient evidence to create a genuine issue of fact \nabout whether those reasons were pretextual.   \nEven without these vehicle flaws, the Court \nshould decline review.  Any divergence in how the \ncircuits approach the Question Presented is more \nform than substance; regardless of how each circuit \nspecifically describes its approach to the Question \nPresented, each circuit is focused on the same under-\nlying question.  Every circuit discussed in the Peti-\ntion asks, in one way or another, whether a plaintiff \nhas shown that an employer\u2019s actions, \u201c\u2018if otherwise \nunexplained,\u201d are \u201cmore likely than not based on the \nconsideration of impermissible factors.\u2019\u201d  Tex. Dep\u2019t of \nCmty. Affairs v. Burdine, 450 U.S. 248, 254 (1981) \n(quoting Furnco Constr. Corp. v. Waters, 438 U.S. \n567, 577 (1978)).  Put another way, all the circuits \nare ultimately trained on the question of what\u2014if \nanything\u2014gives rise to an inference that the plaintiff \nis the minority or the outsider in the context of the \nspecific employment decision the lawsuit challenges.  \nFinally, any difference between the circuits, whether \nin language or substance, arose decades ago.  Despite \nthe longevity of any substantive difference, the cir-\ncuit\u2019s varying formulations rarely, if ever change liti-\ngation outcomes.   \nSTATEMENT \nMarlean Ames worked for the Ohio Department \nof Youth Services in a variety of roles.  Pet.App3a.  \nShe was working as the Administrator of the De-\n\n4 \n \npartment\u2019s Prison Rape Elimination Act program \nwhen the Department created a new position, the \nBureau Chief of Quality Assurance and Improve-\nment.  Pet.App.18a.  Ames applied for the new posi-\ntion.  Id. \nThe Bureau Chief position was a management \nrole that was intended to supervise and guide the \nother members of the Office of Quality and Im-\nprovement.  Pet.App.19a.  Among the key skills that \nthe Department was looking for in a successful can-\ndidate were management, supervision, and workforce \nplanning.  Id.  Ames was one of three people who ap-\nplied for the Bureau Chief job.  Id.  None of them \nwere hired.  Pet.App.20a.  Because there was no \ntimeline for filling the position, the Department de-\ncided to wait to hire someone until an ideal candidate \ncould be found.  Id.   \nSix months after Ames had interviewed for the \nBureau Chief role, the Department hired Yolanda \nFrierson for the job.  Pet.App.20a.  Julie Walburn, \nthe assistant director of the Department, made the \ndecision to hire Frierson.  See Pet.App.18a, 20a\u201321a.  \nAlthough Frierson did not interview for the Bureau \nChief job, Walburn had worked with Frierson in the \npast.  Pet.App.21a.  Walburn felt that Frierson would \nbe a good fit for the role because, among other things, \nFrierson had significant management experience.  \nId.  Although Frierson and Ames were both women, \nFrierson, unlike Ames, was gay.  Id. \nNot long after Ames interviewed for the Bureau \nChief position, she was removed from her role admin-\nistering the Prison Rape Elimination Act program.  \nPet.App.4a.  When the Governor appointed a new Di-\nrector of the Department, he had stressed to that Di-\n\n5 \n \nrector, Ryan Gies, that addressing sexual victimiza-\ntion within the juvenile corrections system was a \nhigh priority.  See Pet.App.18a, 21a\u201322a.  Gies there-\nfore began restructuring the Department\u2019s programs.  \nPet.App.21a\u201322a.   \nIt was that restructuring that cost Ames her posi-\ntion.  Pet.App.22a.  Gies felt that Ames was difficult \nto work with.  Id.  And Walburn was concerned that \nAmes could not oversee a more proactive approach to \ncomplying with the Prison Rape Elimination Act.  Id.  \nAmes was reassigned to a different role within the \nDepartment, one that she had previously held and \nthat paid less, Pet.App.18a, and Alex Stojsavljevic \nwas selected to oversee the Prison Rape Elimination \nAct program, Pet.App.23a.  Stojsavljevic is a gay \nman.  See id. \nAmes filed a complaint with the Equal Opportuni-\nty Commission and received a right-to-sue letter.  \nPet.App.4a.  Ames then filed a complaint in federal \ndistrict court.  Id.  As is relevant here, Ames\u2019s com-\nplaint alleged that the Department discriminated \nagainst her on the basis of sexual orientation (which \nis a form of sex discrimination) when it hired Fri-\nerson for the Bureau Chief role (call this her \u201cpromo-\ntion claim\u201d) and that it discriminated against her on \nthe basis of both sex and sexual orientation when it \ndemoted her and replaced her with Stojsavljevic (call \nthis her \u201cdemotion claim\u201d).  Pet.App.5a, 6a.  The dis-\ntrict court granted summary judgment in the De-\npartment\u2019s favor on both claims, see Pet.App.33a, \n39a\u201340a, and the Sixth Circuit affirmed, Pet.App.3a. \nAmes\u2019s claim related to the Bureau Chief position \nfailed, the Sixth Circuit held, because Ames could not \nmake \na \nprima \nfacie \ncase \nof \ndiscrimination.  \n\n6 \n \nPet.App.5a\u20136a.  Under Sixth Circuit precedent, a \nmajority-group plaintiff like Ames must identify evi-\ndence that would \u201csupport the suspicion that the de-\nfendant is that unusual employer who discriminates \nagainst the majority.\u201d  Pet.App.5a (quoting Arendale \nv. City of Memphis, 519 F.3d 587, 603 (6th Cir. \n2008)).  Ames, the Sixth Circuit held, had not.  \nPet.App.5a\u20136a.  Ames conceded in the district court \nthat Walburn and Gies, neither of whom are gay, \nwere the ones who were responsible for hiring Fri-\nerson. see Opposition to Motion for Summary Judg-\nment, R.72, PageID#2488 n.1.  Ames attempted to \nwalk back that admission on appeal.  She argued in \nthe Sixth Circuit that she had demonstrated back-\nground circumstances of discrimination because a \ndifferent individual made the decision to hire Fri-\nerson and that individual was gay.  See Pet.App.6a.  \nThe Sixth Circuit held, however, that Ames\u2019s conces-\nsion in the district court meant that she had forfeited \nthat argument for purposes of appeal.  Id.   \nThe Sixth Circuit held that Ames\u2019s demotion \nclaim failed for the same reason, at least to the ex-\ntent that Ames alleged that the Department discrim-\ninated against her on the basis of her sexual orienta-\ntion when it replaced her with Stojsavljevic.  See \nPet.App.6a.  But because Ames had also alleged that \nthe Department discriminated against her on the ba-\nsis of sex when it demoted her and selected a man to \nfill her prior position, the Sixth Circuit considered \nthe Department\u2019s proffered reasons for that employ-\nment action.  Pet.App.6a\u20139a.  It held that Ames \nfailed to carry her burden of showing that the De-\npartment discriminated against her.  Id.  The De-\npartment, the Sixth Circuit held, had legitimate, \nnondiscriminatory, reasons for demoting Ames and \n\n7 \n \nhiring Stojsavljevic and Ames failed to introduce any \nevidence that would suggest that those reasons were \npretextual.  See id. \nJudge Kethledge concurred.  Although he joined \nthe opinion in full, he wrote that he disagreed with \nSixth Circuit precedent to the extent that it required \nAmes to show, as part of her prima facie case of sex-\nual-orientation discrimination, that the Department \n\u201cis the unusual employer that discriminates against \nthe majority.\u201d  Pet.App.9a (quotation omitted). \nAmes has now filed a petition for a writ of certio-\nrari in which she challenges the Sixth Circuit\u2019s prec-\nedent, which includes a \u201cbackground circumstances\u201d \ncomponent for employment-discrimination claims to \nproceed down the McDonnell Douglas path if the \nplaintiff is a member of a majority group.  That prec-\nedent required her to point to something that indi-\ncated that the Department was the unusual employ-\ner that discriminates against the majority.  See Pet.i.  \nBut the Question Presented does not challenge the \nportion of the Sixth Circuit\u2019s decision that held that \nthe Department had legitimate, nondiscriminatory \nreasons for demoting Ames and replacing her with \nStojsavljevic.  See, generally, Pet.   \nREASONS FOR DENYING THE PETITION \nI. \nThis case provides a poor vehicle with \nwhich to address the Question Presented. \nThis case has numerous vehicle problems that \nmake it a poor case in which to consider the Question \nPresented.  Any one of those problems provides a \nreason to deny Ames\u2019s petition for a writ of certiorari. \nThe context for these vehicle flaws includes both \nlegal and factual background. \n\n8 \n \nLegally, these flaws intersect with this Court\u2019s \nfrequently invoked tool for assessing discrimination \nclaims in McDonnell Douglas.  All Title VII plaintiffs, \nregardless of the group to which they belong, bear \nthe \u201cultimate burden of persuading the trier of fact \nthat \nthe \ndefendant \nintentionally \ndiscriminated \nagainst\u201d them.  Burdine, 450 U.S. at 253.  The Court \nin McDonnell Douglas adopted a three-step analysis \nto assist courts in reviewing Title VII claims.  At the \nfirst step, a plaintiff bears the burden of establishing \na prima facie case of discrimination.  411 U.S. at 802.  \nOnce she does so, the employer must offer a legiti-\nmate, nondiscriminatory, reason for its actions.  Id. \nat 802\u201303. The plaintiff then bears the burden of \nshowing that the employer\u2019s reasons were pretextual.  \nId. at 804.  McDonnell Douglas\u2019s test was \u201cnever in-\ntended to be rigid, mechanized, or ritualistic,\u201d how-\never; it was simply intended to be \u201ca sensible, orderly \nway to evaluate the evidence in light of common ex-\nperience as it bears on the critical question of dis-\ncrimination.\u201d  Furnco Constr. Corp. v. Waters, 438 \nU.S. 567, 577 (1978). \nFactually, these flaws intersect with Ames\u2019s two \nclaimed acts of employment discrimination.  Recall \nthat she initially challenged both the Department\u2019s \ndecision to promote a different person and the De-\npartment\u2019s decision to demote her when it picked a \ndifferent person to fill Ames\u2019s former role.  Ames \nchallenged the promotion decision as illegal sexual-\norientation discrimination and challenged the demo-\ntion decision as both illegal sex and sexual-\norientation discrimination.  And while the Sixth Cir-\ncuit affirmed judgment against Ames on her orienta-\ntion theories for failing the prima facie inquiry with \nrespect to both her promotion and demotion claims, it \n\n9 \n \naffirmed \njudgment \nagainst \nher \non \nthe \nsex-\ndiscrimination theory because Ames could not show \nany pretext in the Department\u2019s decision to demote \nher and to select someone to replace her at her for-\nmer position.  See Pet.App.7a\u20138a.  The Sixth Circuit, \nthat is, rejected Ames\u2019s claim that the Department \ndiscriminated against her when it demoted her.   \nIn this Court, Ames\u2019s Question Presented targets \nonly a component of the prima facie showing.  The \nconsequence of that choice is that Ames cannot chal-\nlenge the Department\u2019s decision to demote her be-\ncause she has not challenged the lower court\u2019s hold-\nings that the demotion decision involved no pretext \n(and thus no discrimination).    \nWith that legal and factual setting, the following \nfour vehicle flaws point against granting review. \nA. \nAmes did not challenge the Sixth \nCircuit\u2019s prima facie test below. \nAmes never challenged the Sixth Circuit\u2019s \u201cback-\nground circumstances\u201d element below.  She argued \ninstead that she satisfied that requirement.  While \nAmes\u2019s litigation strategy may not have forfeited her \nQuestion Presented in the strictest sense, it still \nmakes this case a poor vehicle with which to consider \nthat question. \nThe Court has indicated that parties need not al-\nways raise their arguments for the first time in the \ncircuit courts.  It has noted that there is no require-\nment that a \u201cparty demand overruling of a squarely \napplicable, recent circuit precedent, even though that \nprecedent was established in a case to which the par-\nty itself was privy and over the party\u2019s vigorous ob-\njection.\u201d  United States v. Williams, 504 U.S. 36, 44 \n\n10 \n \n(1992); see also United States v. Vonn, 535 U.S. 55, \n58 (2002).   \nEven if Ames was not required to challenge exist-\ning Sixth Circuit precedent, she at least should not \nbe able to benefit from her failure to do so.  But that, \nin effect, is what she seeks to do.  As discussed in \nmore detail below, the Sixth Circuit has taken a nu-\nanced approach to determining whether a majority-\ngroup plaintiff has identified background circum-\nstances that suggest discrimination.  See below at \n23\u201324, 33\u201335.  Among other things, it has held that \nthe \u201c[background circumstances] requirement is not \nonerous, and can be met through a variety of means.\u201d  \nJohnson v. Metro. Gov\u2019t of Nashville & Davidson \nCnty., 502 F. App\u2019x 523, 536 (6th Cir. 2012).  Had \nAmes argued that such a requirement is inconsistent \nwith Title VII, then the Sixth Circuit would have had \nthe opportunity to discuss its precedent in greater \ndetail.  It could have explained, for example, that the \n\u201cbackground circumstances\u201d requirement is not a \nhigher burden, merely a different one.  But because \nAmes did not raise that issue, the panel had no rea-\nson to reject her framing of the background circum-\nstances element of the prima facie test.  Put another \nway, one of the reasons that Ames is now able to crit-\nicize the decision below as overly stringent and in-\nflexible is because she herself framed it that way.  \nAnd while that is not waiver or forfeiture formally, \nthe fact that Ames \u201cdid not raise or brief\u201d the ques-\ntion presented \u201cbelow\u201d is a reason to deny certiorari.  \nHoggard v. Rhodes, 141 S. Ct. 2421, 2422 (2021) \n(Thomas, J., respecting the denial of certiorari). \n\n11 \n \nB. \nAnswering the Question Presented \nin Ames\u2019s favor would not change \nthe outcome in this case because \nAmes cannot satisfy a separate \ncomponent of the prima facie \nshowing. \nAmes has affirmatively waived any challenge to \nthe requirement that she establish a prima facie case \nof discrimination.  Pet.28 n.3.  Her only challenge is \nto how the Sixth Circuit applied one component of \nthat rubric in this case.  Ames\u2019s Question Presented \nasks whether, to establish a prima facie case of dis-\ncrimination under Title VII, a majority-group plain-\ntiff must introduce evidence of \u201cbackground circum-\nstances\u201d that suggest discrimination.  See Pet.i.  But \nthe answer to that question will not affect the out-\ncome of this case.  Even if the answer is \u201cno\u201d Ames \nstill could not make a prima facie case of sex discrim-\nination.  And that is a prime reason to deny certiora-\nri.  The Court should \u201cnot ... take up\u201d a question pre-\nsented if the claims underlying that question are \u201cin-\ndependently subject to\u201d defenses that would yield the \nsame result regardless of how the Court answers the \nquestion.  Blankenship v. NBCUniversal, LLC, 144 S. \nCt. 5, 6 (2023) (Thomas, J., concurring in the denial \nof certiorari) \nThere appears to be universal agreement that an \n\u201cemployer cannot intentionally discriminate on the \nbasis of a characteristic of which the employer has no \nknowledge.\u201d  Bostock v. Clayton Cty., 590 U.S. 644, \n691 (2020) (Alito, J., dissenting).  As far as the De-\npartment is aware, every circuit that has considered \nthe question has held that in \u201ccases involving per-\nsonal attributes not obvious to the employer,\u201d a \n\n12 \n \n\u201cplaintiff cannot make out a prima facie case of dis-\ncrimination unless he or she proves that the employ-\ner knew about the plaintiff\u2019s particular personal \ncharacteristic.\u201d  Geraci v. Moody-Tottrup, Int\u2019l, 82 \nF.3d 578, 581 (3d Cir. 1996); Hunter v. UPS, 697 \nF.3d 697, 703\u201304 (8th Cir. 2012); Robinson v. Adams, \n847 F.2d 1315, 1316 (9th Cir. 1987); Lubetsky v. Ap-\nplied Card Sys., 296 F.3d 1301, 1305\u201306 (11th Cir. \n2002); cf. also Raytheon Co. v. Hernandez, 540 U.S. \n44, 54 n.7 (2003) (\u201cIf [an employer] were truly una-\nware that \u2026 a disability existed, it would be impos-\nsible for her hiring decision to have been based, even \nin part, on [the employee\u2019s] disability.\u201d); Landefel v. \nMarion Gen. Hosp., Inc., 994 F.2d 1178, 1181\u201382 (6th \nCir. 1993) (same).  The reverse is also true.  An em-\nployer cannot discriminate in favor of a different em-\nployee if the employer has no knowledge of the fa-\nvored employee\u2019s personal characteristics.  See, e.g., \nPetrikonis v. Wilkes-Barre Hosp. Co., LLC, 582 F. \nApp\u2019x 126, 130 (3d Cir. 2014); Morrow v. Wal\u2013Mart \nStores, Inc., 152 F.3d 559, 563 (7th Cir.1998). \nAmes, however, introduced no evidence that \nwould create a genuine issue of material fact about \nwhether the relevant decisionmakers were aware of \nher sexual orientation, or of the orientation of Fri-\nerson, the person who was ultimately hired for the \njob to which Ames had applied.  The only evidence on \nthat point indicated just the opposite.  The only evi-\ndence related to Walburn\u2019s knowledge with respect to \neither woman showed that she was unaware of Fri-\nerson\u2019s sexual orientation (and was silent with re-\nspect to Ames).  See Motion for Summary Judgment, \nR.71, PageID#2375 (citing Walburn Depo. R.60, \nPageID#668).  And the only evidence related to oth-\ners\u2019 knowledge of Ames\u2019s sexual orientation showed \n\n13 \n \nthat her direct supervisor did not know whether \nAmes was gay or straight.  See id. at 2367 (citing \nTrim Depo., R.64, PageID#1511).  Ames\u2019s failure to \nintroduce any evidence on this point means that no \nmatter how the Court answers the Question Present-\ned her discrimination claim would still fail at the \nprima facia stage.   \nTo be sure, the Sixth Circuit noted that, if not for \nthe background circumstances element, then Ames\u2019s \nprima facie case would have been \u201ceasy to make.\u201d  \nSee Pet.App.5a.  It is clear from context, however, \nthat the Sixth Circuit was referring only to the ele-\nments of a prima facie case discussed in McDonnell \nDouglas.  See id.  Knowledge of an employee\u2019s per-\nsonal characteristics is an additional, threshold, re-\nquirement of a prima facie case, however, and one \nthat the Sixth Circuit did not discuss.  See id.; \nGeraci, 82 F.3d at 581 (noting that McDonnell Doug-\nlas \u201cquite properly makes no reference to the em-\nployer\u2019s knowledge of membership in a protected \nclass\u201d because some protected traits will be known to \nmanagement merely by seeing the employee).     \nC. \nEven if Ames could establish a \nprima facie case of discrimination, \nthe outcome of this case still would \nnot change. \nA favorable answer to the Question Presented \nwould not change the result here for a second, inde-\npendent reason\u2014Ames\u2019s claim fails at the later stag-\nes of McDonnell Douglas.  Even if Ames could make \na prima facie case of discrimination, her promotion \nclaim would fail at McDonnell Douglas\u2019s second and \nthird stages.   \n\n14 \n \nThe Department had nondiscriminatory reasons \nfor its hiring decision and Ames cannot show that \nthose reasons were pretextual.  True, the concur-\nrence suggested otherwise below, Pet.App.10a, and \nAmes now makes a similar argument in her petition, \nsee Pet.32.  But they are both off base.  In response to \nthe Department\u2019s motion for summary judgment, \nAmes failed to point to any evidence that created a \ngenuine issue of material fact about whether the De-\npartment\u2019s decision to hire Frierson (instead of \nAmes) was pretextual.  Indeed, Ames did the oppo-\nsite.  She accepted the Department\u2019s recitation of the \nrelevant facts in its summary judgment motion as \ncorrect (with the exception of two minor issues that \nare not relevant here).  See Opposition to Motion for \nSummary Judgment, R.72, PageID#2488 n.1.   \nTo the extent that the concurrence below suggest-\ned that Ames\u2019s case faltered only at the prima facie \nshowing\u2019s step one, it was confused about the facts \nand evidence presented at summary judgment.  The \nconcurrence identified two factors that, it believed, \nprovided strong evidence of pretext: that the De-\npartment twice promoted a gay employee in a \u201cman-\nner adverse to Ames\u201d and that Frierson lacked the \nminimum qualifications for the job for which she was \nhired.  It was wrong on both counts. \nThe first factor\u2014which involved replacing Ames \nas the administrator of the Prison Rape Elimination \nAct program\u2014was irrelevant.  The Sixth Circuit held \nthat the Department had legitimate, nondiscrimina-\ntory, reasons for hiring Stojsavljevic, the other gay \nindividual that the concurrence referenced, for that \nposition, and Ames has not challenged that portion of \nthe Sixth Circuit\u2019s decision through her Question \n\n15 \n \nPresented.  Because it is now settled that the De-\npartment did not discriminate against Ames when it \nhired Stojsavljevic, that hiring decision cannot serve \nas evidence that the Department\u2019s other actions were \npretextual.  See Pet.12 n.2 (waiving any challenge to \nthe Sixth Circuit\u2019s sex discrimination ruling).   \nAs for the concurrence\u2019s second factor, it misread \nthe record when it stated that Frierson \u201clacked the \nminimum qualifications for the job\u201d for which she \nwas hired.  See Pet.App.10a.  The undisputed evi-\ndence showed that Frierson was qualified.  The job \nposting listed alternative qualifications: an applicant \nwas required to have either a college degree or rele-\nvant work experience.  Motion for Summary Judg-\nment, East Decl., R.71-4, PageID#2419.  And while \nFrierson did not have a degree, she did have the ex-\nperience.  Motion for Summary Judgment, East \nDecl., R.71-5, PageID#2460\u201368.  It was that experi-\nence, in fact, that led the Department to hire her.  \nWalburn Depo., R.60, PageID#635\u201337, 639.  Ames \nmay have argued in the Sixth Circuit that Frierson \nwas not qualified, but she did not introduce any evi-\ndence that created a genuine issue of material fact \nabout Frierson\u2019s qualifications.  Cf. Ames Opposition \nto Summary Judgment, R.72, PageID#2488 (conced-\ning that \u201c[t]he Statement of Facts included in the De-\nfendant\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment is largely \ncorrect\u201d).  Ames\u2019s argument was different in the dis-\ntrict court.  Ames never argued in the district court \nthat Frierson was unqualified.  See Opposition to \nMotion for Summary Judgment, R.72, PageID#2495\u2013\n96.  She argued only that she was more qualified \nthan Frierson was.  Id.  \n\n16 \n \nBecause the Sixth Circuit would likely \u201chave \nreached the same conclusion\u201d that the Department \nshould prevail on summary judgment even if it \nagreed with Ames, certiorari is unwarranted.  See, \ne.g., Hittson v. Chatman, 576 U.S. 1028 (2015) (Gins-\nburg, J., concurring in the denial of certiorari). \nD. \nAmes fails to distinguish between \nthe portion of the Sixth Circuit\u2019s \ndecision that she has challenged \nand the portion that she has not. \nThe Sixth Circuit below considered two separate \ndiscrimination claims and rejected them both.  It \nheld that Ames had failed to make a prima facie case \nof discrimination with respect to her promotion \nclaim.  It also held that Ames had failed to show that \nthe Department\u2019s decision to demote and replace her \nwas discriminatory.  Ames\u2019s demotion claim rested \non two theories of discrimination: sex and sexual ori-\nentation.  But although the Sixth Circuit held that \nAmes had established a prima facie case of discrimi-\nnation only with respect to her sex-discrimination \ntheory, that does not matter; the same nondiscrimi-\nnatory reasons were sufficient to resolve Ames\u2019s sex \nand sexual orientation theories.  Title VII claims \nchallenge employment actions.  See 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a72000e-2(a).  And, generally, the \u201csame legitimate, \nnondiscriminatory reasons that [an employer] ad-\nvance[d] against a finding of \u2026 discrimination apply \nequally to\u201d all similar claims of discrimination aris-\ning from the same event, even if the protected class \nthat provides the basis for the claim differs.  Cf. Hrd-\nlicka v. GM LLC, 63 F.4th 555, 575 (6th Cir. 2023). \nAmes has not challenged the portion of the Sixth \nCircuit\u2019s decision that held that the Department had \n\n17 \n \nnondiscriminatory reasons for demoting her.  The \nQuestion Presented therefore involves only Ames\u2019s \nclaim that the Department discriminated against her \nwhen it promoted Frierson instead of her.  See Pet.i.  \nIn other words, it involves only her promotion claim, \nnot her demotion claim.   \nAmes confuses the Question Presented in this \ncase by suggesting otherwise.  Ames writes that this \ncase involves a \u201cdemotion decision.\u201d  See Pet.32.  Not \nso.  The demotion decision she references involves \nthe demotion claim that she has not challenged \nthrough her Question Presented.  Ames\u2019s failure to \nproperly distinguish between the claim that is before \nthe court, and the one that is not, provides just one \nmore reason why this case provides a poor vehicle to \naddress the Question Presented.  \u201c[A]t the very least\u201d \nAmes\u2019s litigation strategy \u201cwould complicate [the \nCourt\u2019s] review.\u201d  Gordon Coll. v. DeWeese-Boyd, 142 \nS. Ct. 952 (2022) (Alito, J., respecting the denial of \ncertiorari).  And that is reason enough to deny certio-\nrari. \nII. \nThere is no meaningful circuit split; the \ndifferences between the circuits are \nlargely differences in language not law. \nThe Court should deny certiorari even if this \ncase\u2019s vehicle problems did not otherwise render it \nnon-cert worthy.  Ames claims to spy a circuit split \nwith respect to the relevant prima facie test for dis-\ncrimination claims brought by members of a majority \ngroup.  But any differences between the circuits are \nmore differences of terminology than consequential \nlegal substance.   Regardless of the long-standing dif-\nference in language that some circuits use, the out-\ncome is largely the same. \n\n18 \n \nA. \nThis Court\u2019s precedent instructs \nthat the McDonnell Douglas test is \na flexible one.  \nThis Court\u2019s decision in McDonnell Douglas pro-\nvides the foundation for a large majority of Title VII \nclaims.  Ames does not dispute that every circuit, \neven those that she alleges conflict with one another, \napplies that decision to at least some degree.  To the \nextent that Ames alleges that a split exists, it is a \nsplit over how the various circuits apply McDonnell \nDouglas.  Before addressing Ames\u2019s claimed split, \nsome background about that decision, and the \nCourt\u2019s precedent interpreting and applying it, is \ntherefore needed. \nBecause direct evidence of discrimination \u201c\u2018essen-\ntially requires an admission by the employer,\u2019 such \nevidence \u2018is rare.\u2019\u201d  Argyropoulos v. City of Alton, 539 \nF.3d 724, 733 (7th Cir. 2008) (citations omitted). \nThat is one reason why the Court adopted what is \nnow known as the McDonnell Douglas test.  Under \nthat test, a plaintiff may rely on indirect evidence to \nprove a discrimination claim.  The first step of \nMcDonnell Douglas\u2019s test requires a plaintiff to es-\ntablish a prima facie case of discrimination by show-\ning four things: \u201c(i) that he belongs to a racial minor-\nity; (ii) that he applied and was qualified for a job for \nwhich the employer was seeking applicants; (iii) that, \ndespite his qualifications, he was rejected; and (iv) \nthat, after his rejection, the position remained open \nand the employer continued to seek applicants from \npersons of complainant\u2019s qualifications.\u201d  McDonnell \nDouglas, 411 U.S. at 802.  But because \u201cfacts neces-\nsarily will vary in Title VII cases,\u201d the Court in \nMcDonnell Douglas acknowledged that the four-part \n\n19 \n \ntest it laid out will not apply \u201cin every respect to dif-\nfering factual situations.\u201d  Id. at 802 n.13.  Indeed, \npart one \u201cof this sample pattern of proof was set out \nonly to demonstrate how the racial character of the \ndiscrimination could be established in the most \ncommon sort of case, and not as an indication of any \nsubstantive limitation of Title VII\u2019s prohibition of ra-\ncial discrimination.\u201d  McDonald, 427 U.S. at 279 n.6 \n(1976) \nThe Court\u2019s subsequent decisions reaffirmed that \nMcDonnell Douglas was \u201c\u2018never intended to be rigid, \nmechanized, or ritualistic. Rather, it is merely a sen-\nsible, orderly way to evaluate the evidence in light of \ncommon experience as it bears on the critical ques-\ntion of discrimination.\u2019\u201d  USPS Bd. of Governors v. \nAikens, 460 U.S. 711, 715 (1983) (quoting Furnco, \n438 U.S. at 577).  The relevant question in Title VII \ncases is \u201calways whether the employer is treating \n\u2018some people less favorably than others because of \ntheir race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.\u2019\u201d \nFurnco, 438 U.S. at 577 (quoting Int\u2019l Brotherhood of \nTeamsters v. United States, 431 U.S. 324, 335 n.15 \n(1977)).  A plaintiff makes out a prima facie case of \ndiscrimination under McDonnell Douglas and Title \nVII by \u201cshowing actions taken by the employer from \nwhich one can infer, if such actions remain unex-\nplained, that it is more likely than not that such ac-\ntions were \u2018based on a discriminatory criterion illegal \nunder the Act.\u2019\u201d  Furnco, 438 U.S. at 576 (quoting \nTeamsters, 431 U.S. at 358); see also Young v. UPS, \n575 U.S. 206, 228 (2015) (same).  McDonnell Douglas \nis not an end in itself; it exists simply to eliminate \n\u201cthe most common nondiscriminatory reasons for the \nplaintiff\u2019s rejection.\u201d  Burdine, 450 U.S. at 253\u201354.   \n\n20 \n \nConsistent with the Court\u2019s precedent, lower \ncourts have modified McDonnell Douglas\u2019s test as \nnecessary to account for a specific plaintiff\u2019s discrim-\nination claims.  They have, for example, adopted \nmodified versions of the McDonnell Douglas test to \ngovern discriminatory promotion claims, Bundy v. \nJackson, 641 F.2d 934, 951 (D.C. Cir. 1981), retalia-\ntion claims, Laster v. City of Kalamazoo, 746 F.3d \n714, 730 (6th Cir. 2014), and discriminatory disci-\npline claims, Reives v. Illinois State Police, 29 F.4th \n887, 891\u201392 (7th Cir. 2022); see also Murray v. This-\ntledown Racing Club, Inc., 770 F.2d 63, 67 (6th Cir. \n1985) (noting that \u201ccourts have modified the McDon-\nnell Douglas standard to address disparate treat-\nment cases involving all discrimination prohibited by \nthe Act in promotion, firing, compensation or other \nconditions of employment\u201d). \nOne other modification involves claims by majori-\nty-group plaintiffs;  what some call \u201creverse\u201d discrim-\nination.  It is impossible to apply McDonnell Douglas \nliterally to such cases. The first prong of the McDon-\nnell Douglas prima facie test asks, after all, whether \nthe plaintiff was a \u201cracial minority.\u201d  McDonnell \nDouglas, 411 U.S. at 802; see also Parker v. Balti-\nmore & Ohio R. Co., 652 F.2d 1012, 1017 (D.C. Cir. \n1981).  Courts must therefore always adapt McDon-\nnell Douglas to at least some degree when they are \nconfronted with a \u201creverse\u201d discrimination claim.  \nThe Sixth Circuit, like many courts around the coun-\ntry, has adopted a prima facie test to govern discrim-\nination claims filed by members of a majority group \nwho allege that they were discriminated against in \nfavor of a minority group.  Those courts require a \nplaintiff who alleges discrimination based on the \nplaintiff\u2019s membership in a majority group to point to \n\n21 \n \nbackground circumstances that provide some evi-\ndence to \u201csupport the suspicion that the defendant is \nthat unusual employer who discriminates against the \nmajority.\u201d  Thistledown Racing, 770 F.2d at 67 (quot-\ning Parker, 652 F.2d at 1017).  This requirement is \noften shorthanded as simply a \u201cbackground circum-\nstances\u201d requirement.  But regardless of its label, a \nmajority plaintiff\u2019s burden, like the burden minority \nplaintiffs bear, is \u201cnot onerous.\u201d  Compare Johnson, \n502 F. App\u2019x at 536 with Burdine, 450 U.S. at 253. \nB. \nThere is no meaningful \ndisagreement between the circuits \nabout the ultimate legal standard \nthat McDonnell Douglas \nestablished. \nAmes argues that there is a split over how Courts \nhave applied McDonnell Douglas to \u201creverse\u201d dis-\ncrimination claims.  She groups the circuits into \nthree categories 1) circuits that have adopted a \n\u201cbackground circumstances\u201d requirement, 2) circuits \nthat she claims do not apply a \u201cbackground circum-\nstances\u201d requirement, and 3) circuits that have ex-\nplicitly rejected such a requirement.  See Pet.14\u201325  \nA close examination of the cases she cites reveals, \nhowever, that even though some circuits have used \ndifferent language to describe their approach, they \nultimately all focus on the same basic legal question: \nare there facts from which one can \u201cinfer, if such ac-\ntions remain unexplained, that it is more likely than \nnot that [an employer\u2019s] actions were based on a dis-\ncriminatory criterion illegal under\u201d Title VII.  \nFurnco, 438 U.S. at 576 (quotation omitted). \n\n22 \n \n1. \nIn \u201creverse\u201d discrimination \ncases, the Sixth, Seventh, \nEighth, Tenth, and D.C. \nCircuits describe the prima \nfacie case\u2019s first step as a \nshowing about background \ncircumstances. \nThe D.C. Circuit was one of the first courts to ap-\nply McDonnell Douglas to a \u201creverse\u201d discrimination \nclaim.  It noted that \u201c[m]embership in a socially dis-\nfavored group was the assumption on which the en-\ntire McDonnell Douglas analysis was predicated,\u201d \nand that the first element of the prima facie test \ntherefore necessarily needed to adapt when a mem-\nber of a majority group filed a Title VII claim.  Par-\nker, 652 F.2d at 1017   Applying a modified version of \nMcDonnell Douglas, it held that a plaintiff who is a \nmember of a majority group makes out a prima facie \nshowing of discrimination when she demonstrates \nthat \u201cbackground circumstances support the suspi-\ncion that the defendant is that unusual employer \nwho discriminates against the majority.\u201d  See id.  \nSuch circumstances, the D.C. Circuit wrote, \u201cserved \nas a functional equivalent of the first McDonnell \nDouglas criterion, membership in a racial minority.\u201d  \nId. at 1018.  Applying that standard, the court held \nthat the plaintiff in Parker made out a prima facie \ncase of discrimination when he pointed to a racially \ndiscriminatory work environment.  Id.  Subsequent \nD.C. Circuit decisions made clear that the \u201cback-\nground circumstances\u201d element is not intended to \ndisadvantage plaintiffs who are members of majority \ngroups, nor is it \u201can additional hurdle.\u201d  Harding v. \nGray, 9 F.3d 150, 153\u201354 (D.C. Cir. 1993).  It is simp-\nly a tool for \u201cdetermining when an employer\u2019s con-\n\n23 \n \nduct raises an inference of discrimination under the \nSupreme \nCourt\u2019s \nMcDonnell \nDouglas/Burdine \nstandard.\u201d  Id. at 153.  \nFollowing Parker, the Sixth, Seventh, Eighth, and \nTenth circuits have used the \u201cbackground circum-\nstances\u201d language to describe the first component of \na prima facie analysis for \u201creverse\u201d discrimination \nclaims.  Like the D.C. Circuit, however, those circuits \nhave emphasized that \u201cbackground circumstances\u201d \ncomponent is easily satisfied.  Most significantly for \npurposes of this case, the Sixth Circuit has held that \nthe background circumstances \u201crequirement is not \nonerous, and can be met through a variety of means.\u201d  \nJohnson, 502 F. App\u2019x at 536.  A male plaintiff in a \nfailure-to-hire case, for example, can satisfy the re-\nquirement by showing that the decisionmaker and \nthe person ultimately hired were both women.  See \nPet.App.6a.  He can demonstrate \u201cbackground cir-\ncumstances,\u201d in other words, by showing that he was \nin the minority in the relevant sense. \nThe Sixth Circuit\u2019s recent decisions, which make \nclear that a plaintiff\u2019s burden is not onerous, also put \nto rest any concerns in older Sixth Circuit decisions \nthat majority-group plaintiffs may bear a high bur-\nden.  See Pierce v. Commonwealth Life Ins. Co., 40 \nF.3d 796, 801 n.7 (6th Cir. 1994); cf. Briggs v. Porter, \n463 F.3d 507, 517 (6th Cir. 2006) (describing a plain-\ntiff\u2019s burden as \u201cmore difficult\u201d).  To the extent that \nthe Sixth Circuit in past decades may have expressed \nmisgivings about the \u201cbackground circumstances\u201d \nanalysis, its more recent decisions have clarified the \nshowing\u2019s low bar.  See Johnson, 502 F. App\u2019x at 536. \nThe Seventh, Eighth, and Tenth Circuits also do \nnot treat the background circumstances requirement \n\n24 \n \nas onerous.  They too look to it as nothing more than \na substitute for otherwise inapplicable elements of \nthe prima facie test discussed in McDonnell Douglas.  \nThe Seventh Circuit, in adopting a background cir-\ncumstances requirement, emphasized that the re-\nquirement \u201cis not to be interpreted in a constricting \nfashion.\u201d  Mills v. Health Care Serv. Corp., 171 F.3d \n450, 457 (7th Cir. 1999).  And the Eighth Circuit and \nTenth Circuits have likewise treated the background \ncircumstances component of a prima facie case not as \na \u201chigher\u201d or \u201cadditional\u201d burden, but simply an al-\nternative showing that plaintiffs must make \u201cin lieu \nof\u201d showing that the plaintiff belongs to a minority \ngroup.  Notari v. Denver Water Dep\u2019t., 971 F.2d 585, \n589 (10th Cir. 1992); Hammer v. Ashcroft, 383 F.3d \n722, 724 (8th Cir. 2004); see also Duffy v. Wolle, 123 \nF.3d 1026, 1035\u201337 (8th Cir. 1997) (applying \nMcDonnell Douglas framework to a Bivens v. Six \nUnknown Fed. Narcotics Agents, 403 U.S. 388, (1971) \nclaim). \nMost significantly, none of the circuits that use \nthe \u201cbackground circumstances\u201d language dispute \nthat plaintiffs who are members of a majority group \nare \u201centitled to the same Title VII protection as a \nminority plaintiff.\u201d  Harding, 9 F.3d at 153; see also \nThistledown Racing, 770 F.2d at 67 (\u201cTitle VII, of \ncourse, prohibits racial discrimination against all \ngroups\u201d); Mills, 171 F.3d at 454\u201355 (\u201c[I]t is well set-\ntled law that the protections of Title VII are not lim-\nited to members of historically discriminated-against \ngroups.\u201d); Schaffhauser v. UPS, 794 F.3d 899, 902 \n(8th Cir. 2015) (\u201cTitle VII prohibits an employer from \ndiscriminating against any individual \u2018because of \nsuch individual\u2019s race.\u2019\u201d (emphasis added)); Notari, \n971 F.2d at 588 (noting that \u201cit is clear that Title \n\n25 \n \nVII\u2019s protection is not limited to those individuals \nwho are members of historically or socially disfa-\nvored groups\u201d). \n2. \nThe Third and Eleventh \nCircuits are in accord with \nthe other circuits. \nAmes argues that there is a direct conflict be-\ntween the Third and Eleventh Circuits and those cir-\ncuits that apply a \u201cbackground circumstances\u201d re-\nquirement as part of the prima facie test for \u201creverse\u201d \ndiscrimination claims.  The Third and Eleventh cir-\ncuits, she claims have \u201cexplicitly rejected\u201d such a re-\nquirement.  Pet.19.  Ames overreads those decisions.  \nWhile the Third and Eleventh Circuits have chosen \nnot to apply an explicit \u201cbackground circumstances\u201d \nrequirement, those circuits still apply the same basic \nTitle VII standard that other circuits apply. \nThe Third Circuit, it is true, has declined to adopt \nthe \u201cbackground circumstances\u201d language in \u201cre-\nverse\u201d discrimination cases.  Iadimarco v. Runyon, \n190 F.3d 151, 160 (3d Cir. 1999).  But it has never-\ntheless recognized that there are problems with the \n\u201cwording of the very first prong of the McDonnell \nDouglas [prima facie] test\u201d that mandate at least \nsome modification of that test with respect to \u201cre-\nverse\u201d discrimination claims.  Id. at 158.  Rather \nthan use the language of \u201cbackground circumstanc-\nes,\u201d however, it has held that a Title VII plaintiff \n\u201cshould be able to establish a prima facie case \u2026 by \npresenting sufficient evidence to allow a reasonable \nfact finder to conclude (given the totality of the cir-\ncumstances) that the defendant treated [a] plaintiff \n\u2018less favorably than others because of [his] race, col-\nor, religion, sex, or national origin.\u2019\u201d  Id. at 163 (quot-\n\n26 \n \ning Furnco, 438 U.S. at 577).  That is not meaning-\nfully different from the legal standard that other cir-\ncuits apply.  The Third Circuit in fact acknowledged \nthat the background-circumstances requirement, as \napplied by the circuits that have adopted it, often re-\nquires only that a plaintiff offer \u201csufficient evidence \nto support the reasonable probability of discrimina-\ntion.\u201d  Id. at 162. \nAt least one member of the Iadimarco panel be-\nlieved the primary difference between the test that \nthe Third Circuit adopted and the \u201cbackground cir-\ncumstances\u201d test was their wording and that the \nThird Circuit\u2019s test was \u201cmerely a restatement of the \nMcDonnell Douglas test.\u201d  Id. at 163 n.10.  That \nmember of the panel rejected the \u201cbackground cir-\ncumstances\u201d phrasing not because it was necessarily \nan incorrect statement of law, but because its fram-\ning was \u201cjust too vague and too prone to misinterpre-\ntation and confusion to apply fairly and consistently.\u201d  \nId.   \nThe other Third Circuit decisions that Ames cites \nalso do not support her claimed split.  The Third Cir-\ncuit did not discuss \u201cbackground circumstances\u201d at \nall in Phillips v. Legacy Cabinets, 87 F.4th 1313 \n(11th Cir. 2023).  Even if it had, it would not have \nmattered.  Because the plaintiff and the relevant de-\ncisionmaker were of different races, see id. at 1316, \nthe plaintiff would have been able to demonstrate \nbackground \ncircumstances \nin \nany \nevent, \nsee \nPet.App.5a.  Ellis v. Bank of N.Y. Mellon Corp, is \neven less relevant; all that the Third Circuit did in \nthat case was state the obvious proposition that a \n\u201creverse\u201d discrimination plaintiff \u201cneed not show she \n\n27 \n \nis a member of a minority group.\u201d  837 F. App\u2019x 940, \n941 n.3 (2021). \nThe Eleventh Circuit decisions that Ames cites \nare of even less relevance.  Two of the cases did not \ninvolve McDonnell Douglas\u2019s prima facie test at all.  \nBass v. Bd. of County Comm\u2019rs, 256 F.3d 1095, 1104  \n(11th Cir. 2001) (\u201cIn this case, the County has not \ndisputed that Bass established a prima facie case of \ndiscrimination under the McDonnell Douglas frame-\nwork.\u201d); Smith v. Lockheed-Martin Corp., 644 F.3d \n1321, 1328 (11th Cir. 2011) (\u201cHere, Mitten did not \nneed to rely on the McDonnell Douglas presumption \nto establish a case for the jury.\u201d).  Any discussion of \nthe \u201cbackground circumstances\u201d element in those de-\ncisions was therefore dicta.  But even then, to the ex-\ntent that the Eleventh District in Bass \u201cexplicitly\u201d \nrejected anything, it was the \u201creverse discrimination\u201d \nlabel.  See Bass, 256 F.3d at 1102\u201303.  Its decision, in \nthat respect, was little more than an uncontroversial \nrecognition that Title VII applies equally to all plain-\ntiffs.  See id.  And Smith, for its part, simply cited \nBass for the principle that a plaintiff need not show \n\u201cbackground circumstances\u201d that suggest discrimina-\ntion.  See 644 F.3d at 1325 n.15.  But if Bass did not \ndecide that question, then neither can it be said did \nSmith. \nDicta aside, the legal test that the Eleventh Cir-\ncuit applied in Smith is, in practice, functionally sim-\nilar to the test that other circuits apply.  It held that \na plaintiff can prevail on a discrimination claim if \n\u201cthe record, viewed in a light most favorable to the \nplaintiff, presents \u2018a convincing mosaic of circum-\nstantial evidence that would allow a jury to infer in-\ntentional discrimination by the decisionmaker.\u2019\u201d  \n\n28 \n \nSmith, 644 F.3d at 1328.  And in other cases, the \nEleventh Circuit has held that its \u201cmosaic\u201d standard \naddresses the same question as \u201cwhen using the \nMcDonnell Douglas framework.\u201d  Tynes v. Fla. Dep\u2019t \nof Juvenile Justice, 88 F.4th 939, 947 (2023).  To be \nsure, some members of the Eleventh Circuit would go \neven further and would abandon McDonnell Douglas \ncompletely.  See id. at 949\u201358 (Newsome, J., concur-\nring).  But whether McDonnell Douglas has outlived \nits usefulness is a question that must wait for anoth-\ner day\u2014and for a party to raise it.  Ames has explic-\nitly declined to do so here.  See Pet.28 n.3. \n3. \nThe First, Second, Fourth, \nFifth, and Ninth Circuits \napply a largely similar prima \nfacie standard. \nAmes identifies two different categories of circuits \nthat, she claims, have implicitly rejected a back-\nground circumstances requirement: those that have \ndeclined to decide whether to apply such a require-\nment and those that have been entirely silent on the \nquestion.  See Pet.22\u201323.   \na. The Second, Fourth, and Ninth Circuits are in \nthe first category of cases.  They have acknowledged \nthe \u201cbackground circumstances\u201d requirement but \nhave not decided whether such a requirement should \nbe part of the prima facie test for \u201creverse\u201d discrimi-\nnation claims.  The fact that they have not taken a \nposition on the Question Presented means, by defini-\ntion, that they are not part of any circuit split.  That \nbeing said, however, the test that those circuits have \napplied is not meaningfully different from the test \nthat other circuits apply.  Like the Sixth, Seventh, \nEighth, Tenth, and D.C. Circuits, the Second, \n\n29 \n \nFourth, and Ninth Circuits all ask whether a plain-\ntiff has pointed to facts that would suggest the pres-\nence of discrimination. \nRather than linger on the framing of the \u201cback-\nground circumstances\u201d requirement, the Second Cir-\ncuit has focused on the ultimate question that \nMcDonnell Douglas was designed to address.  The \nrelevant question for any discrimination claim, it has \nnoted, is whether the events that give rise to a plain-\ntiff\u2019s complaint occurred \u201cunder circumstances which \ngive rise to an inference of unlawful discrimination.\u201d  \nAulicino v. New York Dep\u2019t of Homeless Servs., 580 \nF.3d 73, 80 (2d Cir. 2009) (quotation omitted).  In the \n\u201cconflict\u201d case that Ames cites, the Second Circuit \nheld that it did not need to decide whether to de-\nmand evidence of \u201cbackground circumstances\u201d be-\ncause the plaintiff\u2019s evidence sufficiently demon-\nstrated those circumstances, even if that require-\nment applied.  Id. at 80 n.5.   \nThe Fourth Circuit has adopted a similar ap-\nproach.  It has held that plaintiffs in all discrimina-\ntion cases must point to \u201csome evidence that race \nwas a determining factor in the employer\u2019s decision.\u201d  \nHolmes v. Bevilacqua, 794 F.2d 142, 147 (4th 1986) \n(en banc).  And while it has \u201cexpressly decline[d] to \ndecide \u2026 whether a higher burden\u201d applies to plain-\ntiffs who bring a \u201creverse\u201d discrimination claim, it \nhas held that the burden that its precedent calls for \nis not meaningfully different from the standard that \nthe D.C. Circuit discussed in Parker.  Lucas v. Dole, \n835 F.2d 532, 533\u201334 & n.9 (4th Cir. 1987) (emphasis \nadded). \nFinally, the Ninth Circuit fits into this category \nas well.  In an unpublished decision, it also chose not \n\n30 \n \nto weigh in on how the first component of the \nMcDonnell Douglas prima facie test should be modi-\nfied when faced with a \u201creverse\u201d discrimination \nclaim.  Zottola v. City of Oakland, 32 F. App\u2019x 307, \n311 (9th Cir. 2002).  The plaintiff\u2019s claim in that case, \nthe court held, failed with or without a \u201cbackground \ncircumstances\u201d requirement.  Id. at 311.  The only \nother Ninth Circuit decision that Ames cites also did \nnot address the Question Presented here.  The court \nin that case asked the same question that all other \ncircuits ask: did the plaintiffs provide evidence that \n\u201cgives rise to an inference of unlawful discrimina-\ntion\u201d?  See Hawn v. Exec. Jet Mgmt., 615 F.3d 1151, \n1156 (9th Cir. 2010) (quotation omitted). \nb. The First and Fifth Circuits belong to the sec-\nond category of circuits that Ames identifies: those \nthat have not discussed the \u201cbackground circum-\nstances\u201d element at all.  Like the circuits that have \nexpressly declined to decide whether or how to adjust \nMcDonnell Douglas\u2019s prima facie elements to account \nfor \u201creverse\u201d discrimination claims, the silence of the \nFirst and Fifth Circuits means that they cannot be \nproperly said to conflict with the other circuits.  And \neven though the First and Fifth Circuits have not \naddressed whether a \u201cbackground circumstances\u201d el-\nement is part of the prima facie test for \u201creverse\u201d dis-\ncrimination claims, the legal standard that they ap-\nply is still consistent with the standard that courts \nthat have adopted such a component apply.   \nThe First Circuit in Williams v. Raytheon Co., 220 \nF.3d 16 (1st Cir. 2000), for example, stated that the \nburden of establishing a prima facie case under \nMcDonnell Douglas is \u201cnot onerous.\u201d  Id. at 19.  To \nthe extent that the First Circuit did not discuss the \n\n31 \n \ncomponents of the prima facie test in greater detail, \nthat is because, after briefly discussing those ele-\nments, it largely \u201cput[] aside\u201d those elements and \u201cas \n[it has] often done,\u201d turned \u201cto whether there is evi-\ndence that, notwithstanding the employer\u2019s stated \nreasons for the termination, the real reason, at least \nin part, was \u2026 discrimination.\u201d  See Fontanez-Nunez \nv. Janssen Ortho, LLC, 447 F.3d 50, 56 (1st Cir. \n2006) (quotation omitted).  That is, it focused on the \nquestion of pretext.  Having done so, it held that the \nplaintiff\u2019s claim failed because his evidence did not \n\u201csupport a reasonable inference that [the employer] \nacted out of a discriminatory purpose.\u201d  Williams, \n220 F.3d at 20. \n The Fifth Circuit\u2019s approach in Byers v. Dallas \nMorning News, Inc., 209 F.3d 419 (5th Cir. 2000) is \nsimilar.  Like the First Circuit in Williams, it also \ndid not discuss a \u201cbackground circumstances\u201d ap-\nproach to the prima facie test like the one that some \ncircuits have used.  See id. 425\u201327.  It asked instead \nwhether the plaintiff had carried his burden of pro-\nducing \u201csufficient evidence indirectly demonstrating \ndiscriminatory intent.\u201d  Id. at 427.  The plaintiff in \nWilliams had not done so, the Fifth Circuit held, be-\ncause the only evidence of discrimination he had of-\nfered was \u201chis subjective belief.\u201d  Id.  The Fifth Cir-\ncuit\u2019s requirement that a plaintiff introduce enough \nindirect evidence to suggest a discriminatory motive \nis not meaningfully different from the \u201cbackground \ncircumstances\u201d requirement that other circuits have \nadopted.  The main difference is the label that those \ncircuits have assigned to that element of the prima \nfacie test. \n\n32 \n \nC. \nDistrict court uncertainty is not a \nreason to grant Ames\u2019s petition for \na writ of certiorari. \nHaving failed to make a compelling case that the \ncircuits are divided in a way that meaningfully af-\nfects the outcome of Title VII cases, Ames turns to \nthe district courts.  But even if she is right that some \ndistrict courts are confused about how to apply \nMcDonnell Douglas\u2019s test to \u201creverse\u201d discrimination \nclaims, the remedy for that confusion is further re-\nview in the circuit courts.  Those courts, not this one, \nare best suited to resolve any district court uncer-\ntainty or disagreement.  See Stephen Shapiro, et al., \nSupreme Court Practice, 505 (10th ed. 2013) (federal \ndistrict court conflicts \u201ccan be eliminated by the \ncourts of appeals\u201d); see also S. Ct. Prac. R. 10 (focus-\ning on United States courts of appeals decisions \nwhen considering whether certiorari is warranted).   \n* \n* \n* \nAt bottom, the circuits\u2019 slight variations in ap-\nproaching \u201creverse\u201d discrimination claims involves \nan almost-never-dispositive difference that largely \nboils down to differing verbal formulations.  And \nthose differences cropped up decades ago.  If this is a \nsplit at all, it is stale and largely irrelevant.    \nIII. \nThe Sixth Circuit faithfully applied this \nCourt\u2019s precedent when it held that Ames \nhad not made out a prima facie case of \ndiscrimination. \nRegardless of whether a circuit split exists, the \nSixth Circuit faithfully applies this Court\u2019s precedent \nwhen reviewing Title VII claims.  It has recognized \nthat \u201cTitle VII, of course, prohibits racial discrimina-\n\n33 \n \ntion against all groups.\u201d  Thistledown Racing, 770 \nF.2d at 67 (citing McDonald, 427 U.S. at 276, 279 \n(1976)).  The \u201cbackground circumstances\u201d element \nthat it applies to \u201creverse\u201d discrimination claims re-\nflects this Court\u2019s own focus on whether a plaintiff\u2019s \nallegations \u201c\u2018if otherwise unexplained, are more like-\nly than not based on the consideration of impermis-\nsible factors.\u2019\u201d  Burdine, 450 U.S. at 254 (quoting \nFurnco, 438 U.S. at 577).  And just like this Court \nhas held that McDonnell Douglas\u2019s prima facie \nstandard \u201cwas \u2018never intended to be rigid, mecha-\nnized, or ritualistic,\u2019\u201d Aikens, 460 U.S. at 715, the \nSixth Circuit has recognized that its \u201cbackground \ncircumstances\u201d requirement is \u201cnot onerous\u201d and \nmay be satisfied \u201cthrough a variety of means,\u201d John-\nson, 502 F. App\u2019x at 536. \nTo the extent that the panel\u2019s decision in this case \ncan be read as inflexibly applying a \u201cbackground cir-\ncumstances\u201d requirement, that is likely because of \nthe way Ames chose to litigate her appeal.  She did \nnot challenge the \u201cbackground circumstances\u201d re-\nquirement in any way and, by arguing that she had \ndemonstrated background circumstances, implicitly \naccepted it.  See, Ames Br., App.R.21 at 17\u201320.  In \ndoing so, she offered two reasons why background \ncircumstances existed: the identity of the deci-\nsionmaker (an argument that the panel held she had \nforfeited, see Pet.App.6a) and her own experiences.  \nSee id.  The fact that the panel focused solely on \nthose elements shows only that it engaged with \nAmes\u2019s arguments and wanted to succinctly dispose \nof her claims.  That the panel did not more thorough-\nly discuss an issue that neither of the parties had \nraised is, at most, a drafting issue that does not cre-\n\n34 \n \nate a circuit split\u2014let alone warrant this Court\u2019s re-\nview. \nThis case shows why all plaintiffs, including those \nwho bring \u201creverse\u201d discrimination claims, must \nmake some threshold showing that suggests discrim-\nination.  And it shows why, even if the circuit split \nthat Ames purports to identify exists, there is no \nmeaningful split about the outcome of this case.  The \nacid test for cert-worthiness is whether a case would \ncome out different in different circuits.  This case \nwould not.  \nAmes\u2019s evidence in this case was this: She was a \nwoman who did not receive a job for which she quali-\nfied and to which she had applied.  Walburn, one of \nthe individuals who was responsible for hiring for \nthat job, was also a woman.  And the person who was \nultimately hired for the job was also a woman\u2014and \nwas qualified for the position.  The woman who was \nhired was gay, however, and Ames was not.   \nAmes did not identify any evidence that suggest-\ned sexual orientation played any role in the hiring \ndecision, however.  She did not point to any evidence \nindicating that the relevant decisionmakers were \ngay.  Nor did she point to any evidence suggesting \nthat the decisionmakers knew the sexual orientation \nof either Ames or of the woman that they ultimately \nhired.  She instead conceded in the district court that \nthe Department\u2019s statement of the facts was correct.  \nSee Opposition to Motion for Summary Judgment, \nR.72, PageID#2488 n.1.  Without such evidence, \nthere is nothing that \u201craises an inference of discrimi-\nnation \u2026 if otherwise unexplained.\u201d  See Burdine, \n450 U.S. at 254 (quotation omitted).  Thus, under \nany formulation of McDonnell Douglas\u2019s prima facie \n\n35 \n \ntest, Ames\u2019s claim would fail.  If the Court were to \nhold otherwise, and if it were to hold that Ames es-\ntablished a prima facie case of discrimination in this \ncase anyway, then McDonnell Douglas\u2019s prima facie \nscreening test will have lost almost all of its mean-\ning.  \nCONCLUSION \nThe Court should deny the petition for a writ of \ncertiorari.  \n \nRespectfully submitted, \n \nDAVE YOST \nAttorney General of Ohio \nMICHAEL J.

          "task_beliefs": "My understanding of this case is now characterized by a deep knowledge of the petitioner's position and a clearly defined uncertainty regarding the respondent's. The core legal architecture, derived from the petition for certiorari, remains stable.\n\nThe central issue is confirmed to be the \"Question Presented\": \"Whether, in addition to pleading the other elements of Title VII, a majority-group plaintiff must show 'background circumstances to support the suspicion that the defendant is that unusual employer who discriminates against the majority.'\" This question targets the prima facie stage of the *McDonnell Douglas* burden-shifting framework.\n\nMy knowledge of the crucial circuit split is unchanged and detailed:\n*   **Circuits Requiring \"Background Circumstances\":** D.C., Sixth, Seventh, Eighth, and Tenth.\n*   **Circuits Rejecting the Requirement:** Third and Eleventh.\n*   **Circuits Not Applying the Rule:** First, Second, Fourth, Fifth, and Ninth.\n\nThe petitioner's strategy for reversal is clear and three-pronged: a textualist argument that the rule has no basis in Title VII's text (citing *Bostock* and *Groff*); a precedential argument that it violates *McDonald v. Santa Fe Trail Transp. Co.*; and a practical argument that the rule is unworkable. The case's posture as an \"ideal vehicle\" is also a key part of my understanding, given that the \"background circumstances\" rule was the sole dispositive issue for the sexual orientation claim, a point underscored by Sixth Circuit Judge Kethledge's concurrence inviting Supreme Court review.\n\nThe latest observation (my own internal reasoning) has not added new facts but has critically refined my belief state by formalizing my primary uncertainty. My predictive model is currently one-sided. I have a strong hypothesis\u2014that the Court will grant certiorari and reverse the Sixth Circuit based on the petitioner's powerful textualist arguments\u2014but this hypothesis has not yet been tested against the respondent's counter-arguments. My primary \"known unknown\" is the position of the Ohio Department of Youth Services. To make a robust prediction, I must discover how they will defend the \"background circumstances\" requirement, how they will frame the circuit split, and whether they will challenge the facts or the case's status as a \"clean vehicle.\" My prediction remains a high probability of cert grant and a likely reversal on the merits, but this is now explicitly qualified as being contingent on the strength (or weakness) of the forthcoming respondent's brief.",
          "design_beliefs": "My methodological framework has been significantly enhanced by incorporating a metacognitive layer for directing my research strategy. My foundational heuristics, validated by the analysis of the cert petition, remain in place:\n\n1.  **Prioritize Key Sections of the Cert Petition:** The \"Question Presented,\" \"Reasons for Granting the Petition,\" and \"Table of Authorities\" are the highest-yield sections for initial analysis.\n2.  **Actively Seek Signals from Lower Court Opinions:** Concurrences or dissents that critique circuit precedent are strong indicators of an issue's ripeness for Supreme Court review.\n3.  **Assess the \"Vehicle\" Quality:** A core part of the analysis is to evaluate if the case presents a clean, dispositive legal question, free from confounding facts.\n4.  **Map Arguments to Judicial Philosophy:** Effective prediction requires categorizing legal arguments (textualist, originalist, etc.) and assessing their resonance with the current Court's majority.\n\nThe most recent observation adds a new, more sophisticated layer of strategic heuristics that govern the *sequence* of information gathering:\n\n5.  **Principle of Targeted Uncertainty Reduction:** After processing a major document (like the cert petition), the most effective next action is to explicitly identify the single largest remaining uncertainty in the task-level belief (\u03b8) and select the information source that most directly resolves it. This creates a dynamic, efficient research path.\n6.  **Leverage Case Lifecycle Knowledge:** Understanding the standard sequence of filings in Supreme Court litigation (Petition for Certiorari -> Brief in Opposition -> Reply Brief -> Amicus Briefs) is a powerful heuristic for predicting where the next piece of crucial information will be found. My current plan to seek the \"Brief in Opposition\" is a direct application of this principle to address the uncertainty identified in heuristic #5.\n7.  **Embrace Argumentative Duality:** A robust predictive model must be built on a dialectical understanding of the case. The initial analysis of the petitioner's claims must be followed by a deliberate effort to seek out and model the respondent's counter-arguments. This practice is a crucial guard against confirmation bias and is essential for accurately forecasting the case's outcome. My strategy has now evolved from simply summarizing one side to actively building a model of the entire argumentative landscape."

          "task_beliefs": "My understanding of this case has now evolved from a one-sided model based on the petitioner's arguments to a more complete, dialectical view incorporating the respondent's robust opposition. The core legal question remains the same, but its viability as a Supreme Court case is now seriously challenged.\n\nThe Brief in Opposition (BIO) from the Ohio Department of Youth Services has resolved my primary uncertainty and introduced several powerful counter-arguments that significantly decrease the probability of a cert grant. My belief state is updated as follows:\n\n1.  **Respondent's Core Strategy:** The respondent's strategy is not to defend the \"background circumstances\" rule on its merits, but to argue that this case is the wrong one for deciding the issue. Their arguments are almost entirely focused on denying cert based on procedural and case-specific defects.\n\n2.  **Reframing the Question Presented:** The respondent reframes the petitioner's clear question about the \"background circumstances\" rule into a much broader, more innocuous one: \"Did the Sixth Circuit err when, in using that rubric, it required a discrimination plaintiff to provide some evidence that the employer had a discriminatory motive as part of the prima facie showing?\" This reframing attempts to make the lower court's action sound like a standard application of the *McDonnell Douglas* framework rather than the application of a controversial, heightened standard for a specific class of plaintiffs.\n\n3.  **Vehicle Problems (The Primary Attack):** The respondent's lead argument is that the case is a \"poor vehicle.\" This attack is multi-faceted and compelling:\n    *   **Preservation Failure:** The respondent asserts that Ames never challenged the validity of the \"background circumstances\" test in the lower courts; she only argued that she had met it. This is a powerful argument, as the Supreme Court is reluctant to review arguments not \"pressed or passed upon below.\"\n    *   **Lack of Outcome-Determinacy (Part 1):** The respondent argues that even if the \"background circumstances\" rule were eliminated, Ames's promotion claim would still fail at the prima facie stage because she presented no evidence that the decision-makers knew her sexual orientation.\n    *   **Lack of Outcome-Determinacy (Part 2):** The respondent argues that Ames's demotion claim is moot for purposes of the Question Presented. The Sixth Circuit affirmed the dismissal of her sex-discrimination claim (related to the same demotion) at the *pretext* stage of the *McDonnell Douglas* framework. Because Ames has not challenged that pretext holding, she would lose on the demotion claim regardless of the Court's ruling on the prima facie standard. This makes any opinion on the Question Presented, as it relates to the demotion, effectively advisory.\n\n4.  **Minimizing the Circuit Split:** Where the petitioner presented a clear, entrenched split, the respondent characterizes it as a superficial disagreement over \"language not law.\" They argue that all circuits are ultimately trying to answer the same underlying question from *Burdine* and *Furnco*: whether the evidence gives rise to an inference of discrimination. They contend that the circuits the petitioner cited as rejecting the rule (Third and Eleventh) are actually \"in accord\" with the others in principle.\n\nMy prediction has shifted substantially. The petitioner's narrative of an \"ideal vehicle\" with a clean legal question is now countered by a strong narrative of a procedurally flawed case where the Court's ruling would not change the ultimate outcome. The preservation and outcome-determinacy arguments are particularly damaging to the chances of a cert grant. While Judge Kethledge's concurrence still signals the issue is ripe for review, the respondent has successfully argued that *this* is not the case to do it. My prediction of a \"high probability of cert grant\" is now revised downward to a **low-to-medium probability of a cert grant.** The case for reversal on the merits remains strong *if* cert were granted, but the hurdles to getting there are now much higher and more apparent.",
          "design_beliefs": "This observation has powerfully validated my recently adopted metacognitive heuristics and added a new layer of sophistication to my analytical framework, particularly regarding the strategic dynamics of the cert-stage briefing.\n\nMy foundational heuristics remain stable and effective:\n1.  **Prioritize Key Sections of the Cert Petition.**\n2.  **Actively Seek Signals from Lower Court Opinions.**\n3.  **Assess the \"Vehicle\" Quality.**\n4.  **Map Arguments to Judicial Philosophy.**\n\nMy advanced strategic heuristics have been proven highly effective by this observation:\n5.  **Principle of Targeted Uncertainty Reduction:** This principle guided me to seek the BIO to resolve my single largest unknown (the respondent's position). The resulting observation was incredibly information-rich and fundamentally altered my prediction, confirming this as a highly efficient strategy.\n6.  **Leverage Case Lifecycle Knowledge:** My knowledge that the BIO follows the cert petition allowed me to anticipate and seek the exact document needed to advance my analysis.\n7.  **Embrace Argumentative Duality:** This observation is the perfect illustration of this principle's value. My model has moved from a fragile, one-sided hypothesis to a robust, dialectical understanding of the competing narratives. This protects against confirmation bias and is essential for accurate prediction.\n\nBased on the respondent's strategic choices in the BIO, I am adding several new, more granular heuristics to my methodology:\n8.  **Vehicle Purity is a Primary Battleground:** The cert stage is often won or lost not on the national importance of the legal question, but on the procedural and factual cleanliness of the case. The respondent's brief devoted the majority of its space to attacking the vehicle. Going forward, I will treat the petitioner's \"clean vehicle\" claim as a hypothesis to be rigorously tested against the BIO.\n9.  **Scrutinize for Procedural Bars, Especially Preservation:** The respondent's lead argument was that the petitioner failed to preserve the question for review. This is a common and effective \"off-ramp\" that allows the Court to avoid deciding a contentious issue. I will now explicitly add \"Check for preservation/waiver arguments\" as a key step when analyzing a BIO.\n10. **Deconstruct the Circuit Split Narrative:** A circuit split is not a monolithic fact. It is a narrative constructed by the litigants. I must now analyze not just the *existence* of a split, but *how each side characterizes it*. The respondent's tactic of framing the split as a mere difference in \"language not law\" is a key pattern to watch for.\n11. **Apply the \"Outcome-Determinacy Test\":** A new, critical component of vehicle analysis is to ask: \"If the Court rules for the petitioner on the Question Presented, would the petitioner still lose the case on other, unchallenged grounds?\" The respondent's arguments about the pretext ruling and other prima facie elements show that a non-outcome-determinative question is a fatal vehicle flaw. This test is now a primary tool in my cert-prediction model."

          "task_beliefs": "My understanding of this case began with the petitioner's cert petition, which presented a compelling narrative of an ideal vehicle to resolve a clear circuit split on the \"background circumstances\" test. This led to an initial belief that a cert grant was highly probable.\n\nThis model was fundamentally challenged and updated by the respondent's Brief in Opposition (BIO). The BIO shifted the focus from the merits of the legal question to the procedural and factual defects of the case itself. My beliefs were updated to incorporate these critical points:\n1.  **Respondent's Strategy:** The Ohio Department of Youth Services is not defending the \"background circumstances\" rule but is arguing this case is a \"poor vehicle\" to decide the question.\n2.  **Vehicle Problems:** The respondent's attack on the vehicle is multi-pronged and severe:\n    *   **Preservation Failure:** A powerful claim that Ames never challenged the validity of the test in lower courts, only arguing she met it. The Supreme Court rarely takes up issues not \"pressed or passed upon below.\"\n    *   **Lack of Outcome-Determinacy:** The respondent argues Ames would lose anyway, even if she won on the Question Presented. Her promotion claim allegedly fails for lack of evidence that decision-makers knew her sexual orientation. Her demotion claim is allegedly moot for this question because the Sixth Circuit's dismissal on separate *pretext* grounds has not been appealed. This would make any ruling on the prima facie standard an advisory opinion for that claim.\n3.  **Circuit Split Characterization:** The respondent reframes the split as a superficial disagreement over \"language not law,\" arguing all circuits are fundamentally asking the same question about whether an inference of discrimination exists.\n\nThis dialectical view, incorporating both the petition and the opposition, has significantly lowered my prediction for a cert grant to **low-to-medium probability**. The procedural arguments, particularly preservation and outcome-determinacy, present formidable obstacles for the petitioner. While Judge Kethledge's concurrence signals the issue is important, the respondent has made a strong case that this is not the right case to resolve it.\n\nThis latest observation, which is a synthesis of my own reasoning, does not introduce new facts but solidifies my current belief state. It confirms that the central conflict at this stage is not the merits of the Title VII question, but the procedural viability of the case. My primary uncertainty is now sharply defined: how, or if, the petitioner can rebut the respondent's devastating \"poor vehicle\" arguments. The next crucial piece of evidence is therefore the petitioner's reply brief, which represents their only opportunity to salvage the case's viability for Supreme Court review. My prediction is now contingent on the strength of that forthcoming rebuttal.",
          "design_beliefs": "My methodological framework has evolved from foundational principles to a more sophisticated set of strategic heuristics for analyzing Supreme Court litigation.\n\n**Foundational Heuristics (Stable and Validated):**\n1.  **Prioritize Key Sections of the Cert Petition:** Focus on the Question Presented, the basis for jurisdiction, and the argument for granting the writ.\n2.  **Actively Seek Signals from Lower Court Opinions:** Concurrences and dissents (like Judge Kethledge's) are strong indicators of jurisprudential tension.\n3.  **Assess the \"Vehicle\" Quality:** A clean legal question and factual record are paramount.\n4.  **Map Arguments to Judicial Philosophy:** Understand how arguments appeal to different interpretive methods (e.g., textualism, originalism, pragmatism).\n\n**Advanced Strategic Heuristics (Proven Effective):**\n5.  **Principle of Targeted Uncertainty Reduction:** Actively identify the largest gap in knowledge and seek the specific information source that resolves it (e.g., seeking the BIO to understand the respondent's position).\n6.  **Leverage Case Lifecycle Knowledge:** Understand the sequence of filings (Petition -> BIO -> Reply) to anticipate and plan for the next information-gathering step.\n7.  **Embrace Argumentative Duality:** A robust prediction requires understanding the case as a dialectic between two competing narratives, not just accepting the petitioner's initial framing. This is a powerful guard against confirmation bias.\n\n**Cert-Stage Tactical Heuristics (Learned from the BIO):**\n8.  **Vehicle Purity is a Primary Battleground:** The procedural and factual cleanliness of a case is often more critical at the cert stage than the national importance of the question.\n9.  **Scrutinize for Procedural Bars, Especially Preservation:** A waiver argument (failure to preserve the issue below) is a common and highly effective \"off-ramp\" for the Court to deny cert. This must be a primary checklist item when reviewing a BIO.\n10. **Deconstruct the Circuit Split Narrative:** A circuit split is a contested narrative. I must analyze how each side frames the disagreement (e.g., \"entrenched split\" vs. \"language not law\").\n11. **Apply the \"Outcome-Determinacy Test\":** A critical new test for vehicle analysis is asking: \"If the petitioner wins on the Question Presented, would they still lose the case on other, unchallenged grounds?\" A \"no\" answer signals a potentially fatal vehicle flaw.\n\nThe most recent observation, an act of internal reasoning, validates this entire DBOED process. It confirms that the cycle of analysis, belief updating, uncertainty identification, and targeted information seeking is highly effective. It reinforces the value of my advanced heuristics, particularly #5 and #6. This reflective step itself suggests a new meta-heuristic: **Periodically synthesize all available information to identify the single most critical remaining uncertainty and the most efficient path to resolve it.** My design is now primed for the next stage: analyzing the petitioner's reply brief will not just inform the task prediction, but will also teach me about the *counter-strategies* litigants use to defend a vehicle's purity, adding another layer of sophistication to my understanding of cert-stage advocacy."

Initially, the petition presented the case as an ideal vehicle to resolve a circuit split on the \"background circumstances\" test for Title VII majority-group plaintiffs, leading me to believe a cert grant was probable. However, the BIO fundamentally shifted my model by attacking the case's procedural and factual posture, rather than defending the legal rule itself.\n\nMy beliefs were updated to reflect the respondent's powerful \"poor vehicle\" arguments:\n1.  **Preservation Failure:** The respondent asserts that Ames failed to challenge the validity of the \"background circumstances\" test in the lower courts, which is a significant procedural bar, as the Supreme Court rarely decides issues not \"pressed or passed upon below.\"\n2.  **Lack of Outcome-Determinacy:** The respondent argues that even if the Court sided with Ames on the Question Presented, she would lose anyway. Her demotion claim was dismissed on separate, unappealed pretext grounds, and her promotion claim allegedly fails because the decision-makers were unaware of her sexual orientation. A ruling would therefore be merely an advisory opinion for the demotion claim.\n3.  **Circuit Split Minimization:** The respondent reframes the split as a superficial disagreement over \"language not law.\"\n\nThis led me to downgrade my prediction for a cert grant to **low-to-medium probability**. The case's fate, in my view, became entirely contingent on the petitioner's ability to rebut these procedural attacks in their reply brief. My primary uncertainty was sharply defined: could the petitioner salvage the vehicle's viability?\n\nThe latest observation\u2014a failed search for the petitioner's reply brief\u2014does not alter the substantive analysis of the case but updates my understanding of its current status. The brief is not yet available on the docket. This means the critical evidence I need to resolve my primary uncertainty has not yet been produced. My prediction of a **low-to-medium probability** for a cert grant remains stable, as do the underlying reasons for it. The case is now in a state of active waiting. This observation introduces a new, minor point of uncertainty: whether the petitioner will file a reply at all. While filing is standard practice, waiving the right to reply in the face of such a strong BIO would be a powerful negative signal and would cause my probability estimate to drop to \"very low.\" For now, I assume a reply is forthcoming, and my model awaits this key piece of evidence to be updated.",

While my meta-heuristic (#12) correctly identified the reply brief as the next critical piece of information, my immediate search was premature. This experience demonstrates that an effective design must account for the temporal dimension of the legal process. A null result is not a failure, but data that improves the model. This leads to a new, practical addition to my framework:\n\n**13. Verify Filing Deadlines (New Tactical Heuristic):** Before searching for an anticipated, time-sensitive document (like a reply brief), first consult the docket to determine its filing deadline. This can be done by checking for a scheduling order or by calculating the deadline from the filing date of the preceding document (e.g., a reply brief is typically due 14 days after the BIO). This heuristic refines Heuristic #6 (`Leverage Case Lifecycle Knowledge`) by adding a necessary layer of temporal granularity and makes the execution of Heuristic #5 (`Targeted Uncertainty Reduction`) more efficient by preventing wasted actions. My information-gathering strategy is now more robust, accounting not just for *what* information to seek, but also *when* to seek it."

Title VII\u2019s pro-\ntections apply equally to everyone.  They apply with \nthe same force to members of minority and majority \ngroups.  McDonald v. Santa Fe Trail Transp. Co., \n427 U.S. 273, 278\u201379 (1976).  The Petition argues \nthat the circuits use differing approaches for majori-\nty- and minority-group plaintiffs for one subpart of \none step of one approach to evaluating employment-\ndiscrimination claims.  The Question Presented nev-\ner gets off the ground: Ames did not question the Cir-\ncuit\u2019s longstanding approach to the Question Pre-\nsented until this Court and, not only does the Ques-\ntion Presented does not make a difference to the out-\ncome of this case, it rarely makes a difference in any \ncase. \nPetitioner Marlean Ames never challenged the \nSixth Circuit\u2019s application of the so-called \u201cback-\nground circumstances\u201d approach to Title VII discrim-\nination claims for majority-group plaintiffs.  Her only \nargument below was that she had satisfied that re-\nquirement.  Ames should not be able to raise an ar-\ngument here that she never aired in the courts be-\nlow.  Ames\u2019s failure bears directly on this Court\u2019s re-\nview.  The Sixth Circuit has taken a nuanced ap-\nproach to the background circumstances element\u2014\nbut none of that nuance was relevant in light of the \nway that Ames presented her appeal.  Furthermore, \nat least two Sixth Circuit judges have indicated that \nthey view Students for Fair Admissions v. President \n& Fellows of Harvard College, 600 U.S. 181 (2023) as \n\n2 \n \nresetting the table for the Circuit\u2019s Title VII prece-\ndent, and would rule that way if the issue were \nproperly preserved.  See Smyer v. Kroger Ltd. P\u2019ship \nI, No. 22-3692, 2024 WL 1007116, at *8 (6th Cir. \nMar. 8, 2024) (Boggs, J., concurring); id. at *10 \n(Readler, J., concurring) (also noting that Ames did \nnot raise the Harvard decision). \nWhat is more, answering the Question Presented \nwill not change the outcome here.  Ames challenged \ntwo separate employment actions in the courts be-\nlow: the Department of Youth Services\u2019 failure to \npromote her and its decision to demote her and re-\nplace her with another employee.   \nThe Sixth Circuit held that Ames\u2019s demotion \nclaim failed at a later step of the familiar three-step \napproach to evaluating discrimination claims (see \nMcDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792 \n(1973)).  That employment decision, it held, involved \nno discriminatory motive.  Ames\u2019s Question Present-\ned does not challenge that aspect of the Sixth Cir-\ncuit\u2019s decision and she therefore can no longer chal-\nlenge the Sixth Circuit\u2019s conclusion that the demo-\ntion about which Ames complains was not discrimi-\nnatory.   \nAs for her promotion claim, Ames has affirmative-\nly waived any challenge to the requirement that she \nestablish a prima facie case of discrimination more \ngenerally.  See Pet.28 n.3.  And because she failed to \nintroduce any evidence that the decisionmakers who \nmade the employment decision that she challenges \nknew of her majority-group status (in this case her \nsexual orientation), Ames\u2019s promotion claim would \nhave failed at the prima facie stage even if the Sixth \nCircuit had not used the legal framework Ames chal-\n\n3 \n \nlenges.  What is more, Ames\u2019s claim that she was not \npromoted would also have failed at the next step of \nMcDonnell Douglas\u2019s analysis.  The Department had \nlegitimate, nondiscriminatory, reasons for hiring \nsomeone other than Ames, and Ames has not pointed \nto sufficient evidence to create a genuine issue of fact \nabout whether those reasons were pretextual.   \nEven without these vehicle flaws, the Court \nshould decline review.  Any divergence in how the \ncircuits approach the Question Presented is more \nform than substance; regardless of how each circuit \nspecifically describes its approach to the Question \nPresented, each circuit is focused on the same under-\nlying question.  Every circuit discussed in the Peti-\ntion asks, in one way or another, whether a plaintiff \nhas shown that an employer\u2019s actions, \u201c\u2018if otherwise \nunexplained,\u201d are \u201cmore likely than not based on the \nconsideration of impermissible factors.\u2019\u201d  Tex. Dep\u2019t of \nCmty. Affairs v. Burdine, 450 U.S. 248, 254 (1981) \n(quoting Furnco Constr. Corp. v. Waters, 438 U.S. \n567, 577 (1978)).  Put another way, all the circuits \nare ultimately trained on the question of what\u2014if \nanything\u2014gives rise to an inference that the plaintiff \nis the minority or the outsider in the context of the \nspecific employment decision the lawsuit challenges.  \nFinally, any difference between the circuits, whether \nin language or substance, arose decades ago.  Despite \nthe longevity of any substantive difference, the cir-\ncuit\u2019s varying formulations rarely, if ever change liti-\ngation outcomes.   \nSTATEMENT \nMarlean Ames worked for the Ohio Department \nof Youth Services in a variety of roles.  Pet.App3a.  \nShe was working as the Administrator of the De-\n\n4 \n \npartment\u2019s Prison Rape Elimination Act program \nwhen the Department created a new position, the \nBureau Chief of Quality Assurance and Improve-\nment.  Pet.App.18a.  Ames applied for the new posi-\ntion.  Id. \nThe Bureau Chief position was a management \nrole that was intended to supervise and guide the \nother members of the Office of Quality and Im-\nprovement.  Pet.App.19a.  Among the key skills that \nthe Department was looking for in a successful can-\ndidate were management, supervision, and workforce \nplanning.  Id.  Ames was one of three people who ap-\nplied for the Bureau Chief job.  Id.  None of them \nwere hired.  Pet.App.20a.  Because there was no \ntimeline for filling the position, the Department de-\ncided to wait to hire someone until an ideal candidate \ncould be found.  Id.   \nSix months after Ames had interviewed for the \nBureau Chief role, the Department hired Yolanda \nFrierson for the job.  Pet.App.20a.  Julie Walburn, \nthe assistant director of the Department, made the \ndecision to hire Frierson.  See Pet.App.18a, 20a\u201321a.  \nAlthough Frierson did not interview for the Bureau \nChief job, Walburn had worked with Frierson in the \npast.  Pet.App.21a.  Walburn felt that Frierson would \nbe a good fit for the role because, among other things, \nFrierson had significant management experience.  \nId.  Although Frierson and Ames were both women, \nFrierson, unlike Ames, was gay.  Id. \nNot long after Ames interviewed for the Bureau \nChief position, she was removed from her role admin-\nistering the Prison Rape Elimination Act program.  \nPet.App.4a.  When the Governor appointed a new Di-\nrector of the Department, he had stressed to that Di-\n\n5 \n \nrector, Ryan Gies, that addressing sexual victimiza-\ntion within the juvenile corrections system was a \nhigh priority.  See Pet.App.18a, 21a\u201322a.  Gies there-\nfore began restructuring the Department\u2019s programs.  \nPet.App.21a\u201322a.   \nIt was that restructuring that cost Ames her posi-\ntion.  Pet.App.22a.  Gies felt that Ames was difficult \nto work with.  Id.  And Walburn was concerned that \nAmes could not oversee a more proactive approach to \ncomplying with the Prison Rape Elimination Act.  Id.  \nAmes was reassigned to a different role within the \nDepartment, one that she had previously held and \nthat paid less, Pet.App.18a, and Alex Stojsavljevic \nwas selected to oversee the Prison Rape Elimination \nAct program, Pet.App.23a.  Stojsavljevic is a gay \nman.  See id. \nAmes filed a complaint with the Equal Opportuni-\nty Commission and received a right-to-sue letter.  \nPet.App.4a.  Ames then filed a complaint in federal \ndistrict court.  Id.  As is relevant here, Ames\u2019s com-\nplaint alleged that the Department discriminated \nagainst her on the basis of sexual orientation (which \nis a form of sex discrimination) when it hired Fri-\nerson for the Bureau Chief role (call this her \u201cpromo-\ntion claim\u201d) and that it discriminated against her on \nthe basis of both sex and sexual orientation when it \ndemoted her and replaced her with Stojsavljevic (call \nthis her \u201cdemotion claim\u201d).  Pet.App.5a, 6a.  The dis-\ntrict court granted summary judgment in the De-\npartment\u2019s favor on both claims, see Pet.App.33a, \n39a\u201340a, and the Sixth Circuit affirmed, Pet.App.3a. \nAmes\u2019s claim related to the Bureau Chief position \nfailed, the Sixth Circuit held, because Ames could not \nmake \na \nprima \nfacie \ncase \nof \ndiscrimination.  \n\n6 \n \nPet.App.5a\u20136a.  Under Sixth Circuit precedent, a \nmajority-group plaintiff like Ames must identify evi-\ndence that would \u201csupport the suspicion that the de-\nfendant is that unusual employer who discriminates \nagainst the majority.\u201d  Pet.App.5a (quoting Arendale \nv. City of Memphis, 519 F.3d 587, 603 (6th Cir. \n2008)).  Ames, the Sixth Circuit held, had not.  \nPet.App.5a\u20136a.  Ames conceded in the district court \nthat Walburn and Gies, neither of whom are gay, \nwere the ones who were responsible for hiring Fri-\nerson. see Opposition to Motion for Summary Judg-\nment, R.72, PageID#2488 n.1.  Ames attempted to \nwalk back that admission on appeal.  She argued in \nthe Sixth Circuit that she had demonstrated back-\nground circumstances of discrimination because a \ndifferent individual made the decision to hire Fri-\nerson and that individual was gay.  See Pet.App.6a.  \nThe Sixth Circuit held, however, that Ames\u2019s conces-\nsion in the district court meant that she had forfeited \nthat argument for purposes of appeal.  Id.   \nThe Sixth Circuit held that Ames\u2019s demotion \nclaim failed for the same reason, at least to the ex-\ntent that Ames alleged that the Department discrim-\ninated against her on the basis of her sexual orienta-\ntion when it replaced her with Stojsavljevic.  See \nPet.App.6a.  But because Ames had also alleged that \nthe Department discriminated against her on the ba-\nsis of sex when it demoted her and selected a man to \nfill her prior position, the Sixth Circuit considered \nthe Department\u2019s proffered reasons for that employ-\nment action.  Pet.App.6a\u20139a.  It held that Ames \nfailed to carry her burden of showing that the De-\npartment discriminated against her.  Id.  The De-\npartment, the Sixth Circuit held, had legitimate, \nnondiscriminatory, reasons for demoting Ames and \n\n7 \n \nhiring Stojsavljevic and Ames failed to introduce any \nevidence that would suggest that those reasons were \npretextual.  See id. \nJudge Kethledge concurred.  Although he joined \nthe opinion in full, he wrote that he disagreed with \nSixth Circuit precedent to the extent that it required \nAmes to show, as part of her prima facie case of sex-\nual-orientation discrimination, that the Department \n\u201cis the unusual employer that discriminates against \nthe majority.\u201d  Pet.App.9a (quotation omitted). \nAmes has now filed a petition for a writ of certio-\nrari in which she challenges the Sixth Circuit\u2019s prec-\nedent, which includes a \u201cbackground circumstances\u201d \ncomponent for employment-discrimination claims to \nproceed down the McDonnell Douglas path if the \nplaintiff is a member of a majority group.  That prec-\nedent required her to point to something that indi-\ncated that the Department was the unusual employ-\ner that discriminates against the majority.  See Pet.i.  \nBut the Question Presented does not challenge the \nportion of the Sixth Circuit\u2019s decision that held that \nthe Department had legitimate, nondiscriminatory \nreasons for demoting Ames and replacing her with \nStojsavljevic.  See, generally, Pet.   \nREASONS FOR DENYING THE PETITION \nI. \nThis case provides a poor vehicle with \nwhich to address the Question Presented. \nThis case has numerous vehicle problems that \nmake it a poor case in which to consider the Question \nPresented.  Any one of those problems provides a \nreason to deny Ames\u2019s petition for a writ of certiorari. \nThe context for these vehicle flaws includes both \nlegal and factual background. \n\n8 \n \nLegally, these flaws intersect with this Court\u2019s \nfrequently invoked tool for assessing discrimination \nclaims in McDonnell Douglas.  All Title VII plaintiffs, \nregardless of the group to which they belong, bear \nthe \u201cultimate burden of persuading the trier of fact \nthat \nthe \ndefendant \nintentionally \ndiscriminated \nagainst\u201d them.  Burdine, 450 U.S. at 253.  The Court \nin McDonnell Douglas adopted a three-step analysis \nto assist courts in reviewing Title VII claims.  At the \nfirst step, a plaintiff bears the burden of establishing \na prima facie case of discrimination.  411 U.S. at 802.  \nOnce she does so, the employer must offer a legiti-\nmate, nondiscriminatory, reason for its actions.  Id. \nat 802\u201303. The plaintiff then bears the burden of \nshowing that the employer\u2019s reasons were pretextual.  \nId. at 804.  McDonnell Douglas\u2019s test was \u201cnever in-\ntended to be rigid, mechanized, or ritualistic,\u201d how-\never; it was simply intended to be \u201ca sensible, orderly \nway to evaluate the evidence in light of common ex-\nperience as it bears on the critical question of dis-\ncrimination.\u201d  Furnco Constr. Corp. v. Waters, 438 \nU.S. 567, 577 (1978). \nFactually, these flaws intersect with Ames\u2019s two \nclaimed acts of employment discrimination.  Recall \nthat she initially challenged both the Department\u2019s \ndecision to promote a different person and the De-\npartment\u2019s decision to demote her when it picked a \ndifferent person to fill Ames\u2019s former role.  Ames \nchallenged the promotion decision as illegal sexual-\norientation discrimination and challenged the demo-\ntion decision as both illegal sex and sexual-\norientation discrimination.  And while the Sixth Cir-\ncuit affirmed judgment against Ames on her orienta-\ntion theories for failing the prima facie inquiry with \nrespect to both her promotion and demotion claims, it \n\n9 \n \naffirmed \njudgment \nagainst \nher \non \nthe \nsex-\ndiscrimination theory because Ames could not show \nany pretext in the Department\u2019s decision to demote \nher and to select someone to replace her at her for-\nmer position.  See Pet.App.7a\u20138a.  The Sixth Circuit, \nthat is, rejected Ames\u2019s claim that the Department \ndiscriminated against her when it demoted her.   \nIn this Court, Ames\u2019s Question Presented targets \nonly a component of the prima facie showing.  The \nconsequence of that choice is that Ames cannot chal-\nlenge the Department\u2019s decision to demote her be-\ncause she has not challenged the lower court\u2019s hold-\nings that the demotion decision involved no pretext \n(and thus no discrimination).    \nWith that legal and factual setting, the following \nfour vehicle flaws point against granting review. \nA. \nAmes did not challenge the Sixth \nCircuit\u2019s prima facie test below. \nAmes never challenged the Sixth Circuit\u2019s \u201cback-\nground circumstances\u201d element below.  She argued \ninstead that she satisfied that requirement.  While \nAmes\u2019s litigation strategy may not have forfeited her \nQuestion Presented in the strictest sense, it still \nmakes this case a poor vehicle with which to consider \nthat question. \nThe Court has indicated that parties need not al-\nways raise their arguments for the first time in the \ncircuit courts.  It has noted that there is no require-\nment that a \u201cparty demand overruling of a squarely \napplicable, recent circuit precedent, even though that \nprecedent was established in a case to which the par-\nty itself was privy and over the party\u2019s vigorous ob-\njection.\u201d  United States v. Williams, 504 U.S. 36, 44 \n\n10 \n \n(1992); see also United States v. Vonn, 535 U.S. 55, \n58 (2002).   \nEven if Ames was not required to challenge exist-\ning Sixth Circuit precedent, she at least should not \nbe able to benefit from her failure to do so.  But that, \nin effect, is what she seeks to do.  As discussed in \nmore detail below, the Sixth Circuit has taken a nu-\nanced approach to determining whether a majority-\ngroup plaintiff has identified background circum-\nstances that suggest discrimination.  See below at \n23\u201324, 33\u201335.  Among other things, it has held that \nthe \u201c[background circumstances] requirement is not \nonerous, and can be met through a variety of means.\u201d  \nJohnson v. Metro. Gov\u2019t of Nashville & Davidson \nCnty., 502 F. App\u2019x 523, 536 (6th Cir. 2012).  Had \nAmes argued that such a requirement is inconsistent \nwith Title VII, then the Sixth Circuit would have had \nthe opportunity to discuss its precedent in greater \ndetail.  It could have explained, for example, that the \n\u201cbackground circumstances\u201d requirement is not a \nhigher burden, merely a different one.  But because \nAmes did not raise that issue, the panel had no rea-\nson to reject her framing of the background circum-\nstances element of the prima\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

See McDonnell Doug-\nlas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792 (1973).  Did the \nSixth Circuit err when, in using that rubric, it re-\nquired a discrimination plaintiff to provide some evi-\ndence that the employer had a discriminatory motive \nas part of the prima facie showing?   \n\nii \n \nLIST OF DIRECTLY RELATED PROCEEDINGS \nThe petition\u2019s list of related proceedings is com-\nplete and correct.   \n\niii \n \nTABLE OF CONTENTS \nPage \nQUESTION PRESENTED .......................................... i \nLIST \nOF \nDIRECTLY \nRELATED \nPROCEEDINGS ......................................................... ii \nTABLE OF CONTENTS ........................................... iii \nTABLE OF AUTHORITIES ....................................... v \nINTRODUCTION ....................................................... 1 \nSTATEMENT .............................................................. 3 \nREASONS FOR DENYING THE PETITION ........... 7 \nI. \nThis case provides a poor vehicle with \nwhich \nto \naddress \nthe \nQuestion \nPresented. ...................................................... 7 \nA. Ames did not challenge the Sixth \nCircuit\u2019s prima facie test below. .............. 9 \nB. Answering the Question Presented in \nAmes\u2019s favor would not change the \noutcome in this case because Ames \ncannot satisfy a separate component \nof the prima facie showing. .................... 11 \nC. Even if Ames could establish a prima \nfacie case of discrimination, the \noutcome of this case still would not \nchange. .................................................... 13 \nD. Ames fails to distinguish between the \nportion of the Sixth Circuit\u2019s decision \nthat she has challenged and the \nportion that she has not. ........................ 16 \n\niv \n \nII. \nThere is no meaningful circuit split; the \ndifferences between the circuits are \nlargely differences in language not law. ..... 17 \nA. This Court\u2019s precedent instructs that \nthe McDonnell Douglas test is a \nflexible one. ............................................. 18 \nB. There is no meaningful disagreement \nbetween the circuits about the \nultimate legal standard that \nMcDonnell Douglas established. ........... 21 \n1. In \u201creverse\u201d discrimination cases, the \nSixth, Seventh, Eighth, Tenth, and \nD.C. Circuits describe the prima facie \ncase\u2019s first step as a showing about \nbackground circumstances. ...................... 22 \n2. The Third and Eleventh Circuits are in \naccord with the other circuits. .................. 25 \n3. The First, Second, Fourth, Fifth, and \nNinth Circuits apply a largely similar \nprima facie standard. ................................ 28 \nC. District court uncertainty is not a \nreason to grant Ames\u2019s petition for a \nwrit of certiorari. .................................... 32 \nIII. The Sixth Circuit faithfully applied this \nCourt\u2019s precedent when it held that \nAmes had not made out a prima facie \ncase of discrimination. ................................. 32 \nCONCLUSION .......................................................... 35 \n \n\nv \n \nTABLE OF AUTHORITIES \nPage(s) \nCases \nArendale v.

Title VII\u2019s pro-\ntections apply equally to everyone.  They apply with \nthe same force to members of minority and majority \ngroups.  McDonald v. Santa Fe Trail Transp. Co., \n427 U.S. 273, 278\u201379 (1976).  The Petition argues \nthat the circuits use differing approaches for majori-\nty- and minority-group plaintiffs for one subpart of \none step of one approach to evaluating employment-\ndiscrimination claims.  The Question Presented nev-\ner gets off the ground: Ames did not question the Cir-\ncuit\u2019s longstanding approach to the Question Pre-\nsented until this Court and, not only does the Ques-\ntion Presented does not make a difference to the out-\ncome of this case, it rarely makes a difference in any \ncase. \nPetitioner Marlean Ames never challenged the \nSixth Circuit\u2019s application of the so-called \u201cback-\nground circumstances\u201d approach to Title VII discrim-\nination claims for majority-group plaintiffs.  Her only \nargument below was that she had satisfied that re-\nquirement.  Ames should not be able to raise an ar-\ngument here that she never aired in the courts be-\nlow.  Ames\u2019s failure bears directly on this Court\u2019s re-\nview.  The Sixth Circuit has taken a nuanced ap-\nproach to the background circumstances element\u2014\nbut none of that nuance was relevant in light of the \nway that Ames presented her appeal.  Furthermore, \nat least two Sixth Circuit judges have indicated that \nthey view Students for Fair Admissions v. President \n& Fellows of Harvard College, 600 U.S. 181 (2023) as \n\n2 \n \nresetting the table for the Circuit\u2019s Title VII prece-\ndent, and would rule that way if the issue were \nproperly preserved.  See Smyer v. Kroger Ltd. P\u2019ship \nI, No. 22-3692, 2024 WL 1007116, at *8 (6th Cir. \nMar. 8, 2024) (Boggs, J., concurring); id. at *10 \n(Readler, J., concurring) (also noting that Ames did \nnot raise the Harvard decision). \nWhat is more, answering the Question Presented \nwill not change the outcome here.  Ames challenged \ntwo separate employment actions in the courts be-\nlow: the Department of Youth Services\u2019 failure to \npromote her and its decision to demote her and re-\nplace her with another employee.   \nThe Sixth Circuit held that Ames\u2019s demotion \nclaim failed at a later step of the familiar three-step \napproach to evaluating discrimination claims (see \nMcDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792 \n(1973)).  That employment decision, it held, involved \nno discriminatory motive.  Ames\u2019s Question Present-\ned does not challenge that aspect of the Sixth Cir-\ncuit\u2019s decision and she therefore can no longer chal-\nlenge the Sixth Circuit\u2019s conclusion that the demo-\ntion about which Ames complains was not discrimi-\nnatory.   \nAs for her promotion claim, Ames has affirmative-\nly waived any challenge to the requirement that she \nestablish a prima facie case of discrimination more \ngenerally.  See Pet.28 n.3.  And because she failed to \nintroduce any evidence that the decisionmakers who \nmade the employment decision that she challenges \nknew of her majority-group status (in this case her \nsexual orientation), Ames\u2019s promotion claim would \nhave failed at the prima facie stage even if the Sixth \nCircuit had not used the legal framework Ames chal-\n\n3 \n \nlenges.  What is more, Ames\u2019s claim that she was not \npromoted would also have failed at the next step of \nMcDonnell Douglas\u2019s analysis.  The Department had \nlegitimate, nondiscriminatory, reasons for hiring \nsomeone other than Ames, and Ames has not pointed \nto sufficient evidence to create a genuine issue of fact \nabout whether those reasons were pretextual.   \nEven without these vehicle flaws, the Court \nshould decline review.  Any divergence in how the \ncircuits approach the Question Presented is more \nform than substance; regardless of how each circuit \nspecifically describes its approach to the Question \nPresented, each circuit is focused on the same under-\nlying question.  Every circuit discussed in the Peti-\ntion asks, in one way or another, whether a plaintiff \nhas shown that an employer\u2019s actions, \u201c\u2018if otherwise \nunexplained,\u201d are \u201cmore likely than not based on the \nconsideration of impermissible factors.\u2019\u201d  Tex. Dep\u2019t of \nCmty. Affairs v. Burdine, 450 U.S. 248, 254 (1981) \n(quoting Furnco Constr. Corp. v. Waters, 438 U.S. \n567, 577 (1978)).  Put another way, all the circuits \nare ultimately trained on the question of what\u2014if \nanything\u2014gives rise to an inference that the plaintiff \nis the minority or the outsider in the context of the \nspecific employment decision the lawsuit challenges.  \nFinally, any difference between the circuits, whether \nin language or substance, arose decades ago.  Despite \nthe longevity of any substantive difference, the cir-\ncuit\u2019s varying formulations rarely, if ever change liti-\ngation outcomes.   \nSTATEMENT \nMarlean Ames worked for the Ohio Department \nof Youth Services in a variety of roles.  Pet.App3a.  \nShe was working as the Administrator of the De-\n\n4 \n \npartment\u2019s Prison Rape Elimination Act program \nwhen the Department created a new position, the \nBureau Chief of Quality Assurance and Improve-\nment.  Pet.App.18a.  Ames applied for the new posi-\ntion.  Id. \nThe Bureau Chief position was a management \nrole that was intended to supervise and guide the \nother members of the Office of Quality and Im-\nprovement.  Pet.App.19a.  Among the key skills that \nthe Department was looking for in a successful can-\ndidate were management, supervision, and workforce \nplanning.  Id.  Ames was one of three people who ap-\nplied for the Bureau Chief job.  Id.  None of them \nwere hired.  Pet.App.20a.  Because there was no \ntimeline for filling the position, the Department de-\ncided to wait to hire someone until an ideal candidate \ncould be found.  Id.   \nSix months after Ames had interviewed for the \nBureau Chief role, the Department hired Yolanda \nFrierson for the job.  Pet.App.20a.  Julie Walburn, \nthe assistant director of the Department, made the \ndecision to hire Frierson.  See Pet.App.18a, 20a\u201321a.  \nAlthough Frierson did not interview for the Bureau \nChief job, Walburn had worked with Frierson in the \npast.  Pet.App.21a.  Walburn felt that Frierson would \nbe a good fit for the role because, among other things, \nFrierson had significant management experience.  \nId.  Although Frierson and Ames were both women, \nFrierson, unlike Ames, was gay.  Id. \nNot long after Ames interviewed for the Bureau \nChief position, she was removed from her role admin-\nistering the Prison Rape Elimination Act program.  \nPet.App.4a.  When the Governor appointed a new Di-\nrector of the Department, he had stressed to that Di-\n\n5 \n \nrector, Ryan Gies, that addressing sexual victimiza-\ntion within the juvenile corrections system was a \nhigh priority.  See Pet.App.18a, 21a\u201322a.  Gies there-\nfore began restructuring the Department\u2019s programs.  \nPet.App.21a\u201322a.   \nIt was that restructuring that cost Ames her posi-\ntion.  Pet.App.22a.  Gies felt that Ames was difficult \nto work with.  Id.  And Walburn was concerned that \nAmes could not oversee a more proactive approach to \ncomplying with the Prison Rape Elimination Act.  Id.  \nAmes was reassigned to a different role within the \nDepartment, one that she had previously held and \nthat paid less, Pet.App.18a, and Alex Stojsavljevic \nwas selected to oversee the Prison Rape Elimination \nAct program, Pet.App.23a.  Stojsavljevic is a gay \nman.  See id. \nAmes filed a complaint with the Equal Opportuni-\nty Commission and received a right-to-sue letter.  \nPet.App.4a.  Ames then filed a complaint in federal \ndistrict court.  Id.  As is relevant here, Ames\u2019s com-\nplaint alleged that the Department discriminated \nagainst her on the basis of sexual orientation (which \nis a form of sex discrimination) when it hired Fri-\nerson for the Bureau Chief role (call this her \u201cpromo-\ntion claim\u201d) and that it discriminated against her on \nthe basis of both sex and sexual orientation when it \ndemoted her and replaced her with Stojsavljevic (call \nthis her \u201cdemotion claim\u201d).  Pet.App.5a, 6a.  The dis-\ntrict court granted summary judgment in the De-\npartment\u2019s favor on both claims, see Pet.App.33a, \n39a\u201340a, and the Sixth Circuit affirmed, Pet.App.3a. \nAmes\u2019s claim related to the Bureau Chief position \nfailed, the Sixth Circuit held, because Ames could not \nmake \na \nprima \nfacie \ncase \nof \ndiscrimination.  \n\n6 \n \nPet.App.5a\u20136a.  Under Sixth Circuit precedent, a \nmajority-group plaintiff like Ames must identify evi-\ndence that would \u201csupport the suspicion that the de-\nfendant is that unusual employer who discriminates \nagainst the majority.\u201d  Pet.App.5a (quoting Arendale \nv. City of Memphis, 519 F.3d 587, 603 (6th Cir. \n2008)).  Ames, the Sixth Circuit held, had not.  \nPet.App.5a\u20136a.  Ames conceded in the district court \nthat Walburn and Gies, neither of whom are gay, \nwere the ones who were responsible for hiring Fri-\nerson. see Opposition to Motion for Summary Judg-\nment, R.72, PageID#2488 n.1.  Ames attempted to \nwalk back that admission on appeal.  She argued in \nthe Sixth Circuit that she had demonstrated back-\nground circumstances of discrimination because a \ndifferent individual made the decision to hire Fri-\nerson and that individual was gay.  See Pet.App.6a.  \nThe Sixth Circuit held, however, that Ames\u2019s conces-\nsion in the district court meant that she had forfeited \nthat argument for purposes of appeal.  Id.   \nThe Sixth Circuit held that Ames\u2019s demotion \nclaim failed for the same reason, at least to the ex-\ntent that Ames alleged that the Department discrim-\ninated against her on the basis of her sexual orienta-\ntion when it replaced her with Stojsavljevic.  See \nPet.App.6a.  But because Ames had also alleged that \nthe Department discriminated against her on the ba-\nsis of sex when it demoted her and selected a man to \nfill her prior position, the Sixth Circuit considered \nthe Department\u2019s proffered reasons for that employ-\nment action.  Pet.App.6a\u20139a.  It held that Ames \nfailed to carry her burden of showing that the De-\npartment discriminated against her.  Id.  The De-\npartment, the Sixth Circuit held, had legitimate, \nnondiscriminatory, reasons for demoting Ames and \n\n7 \n \nhiring Stojsavljevic and Ames failed to introduce any \nevidence that would suggest that those reasons were \npretextual.  See id. \nJudge Kethledge concurred.  Although he joined \nthe opinion in full, he wrote that he disagreed with \nSixth Circuit precedent to the extent that it required \nAmes to show, as part of her prima facie case of sex-\nual-orientation discrimination, that the Department \n\u201cis the unusual employer that discriminates against \nthe majority.\u201d  Pet.App.9a (quotation omitted). \nAmes has now filed a petition for a writ of certio-\nrari in which she challenges the Sixth Circuit\u2019s prec-\nedent, which includes a \u201cbackground circumstances\u201d \ncomponent for employment-discrimination claims to \nproceed down the McDonnell Douglas path if the \nplaintiff is a member of a majority group.  That prec-\nedent required her to point to something that indi-\ncated that the Department was the unusual employ-\ner that discriminates against the majority.  See Pet.i.  \nBut the Question Presented does not challenge the \nportion of the Sixth Circuit\u2019s decision that held that \nthe Department had legitimate, nondiscriminatory \nreasons for demoting Ames and replacing her with \nStojsavljevic.  See, generally, Pet.   \nREASONS FOR DENYING THE PETITION \nI. \nThis case provides a poor vehicle with \nwhich to address the Question Presented. \nThis case has numerous vehicle problems that \nmake it a poor case in which to consider the Question \nPresented.  Any one of those problems provides a \nreason to deny Ames\u2019s petition for a writ of certiorari. \nThe context for these vehicle flaws includes both \nlegal and factual background. \n\n8 \n \nLegally, these flaws intersect with this Court\u2019s \nfrequently invoked tool for assessing discrimination \nclaims in McDonnell Douglas.  All Title VII plaintiffs, \nregardless of the group to which they belong, bear \nthe \u201cultimate burden of persuading the trier of fact \nthat \nthe \ndefendant \nintentionally \ndiscriminated \nagainst\u201d them.  Burdine, 450 U.S. at 253.  The Court \nin McDonnell Douglas adopted a three-step analysis \nto assist courts in reviewing Title VII claims.  At the \nfirst step, a plaintiff bears the burden of establishing \na prima facie case of discrimination.  411 U.S. at 802.  \nOnce she does so, the employer must offer a legiti-\nmate, nondiscriminatory, reason for its actions.  Id. \nat 802\u201303. The plaintiff then bears the burden of \nshowing that the employer\u2019s reasons were pretextual.  \nId. at 804.  McDonnell Douglas\u2019s test was \u201cnever in-\ntended to be rigid, mechanized, or ritualistic,\u201d how-\never; it was simply intended to be \u201ca sensible, orderly \nway to evaluate the evidence in light of common ex-\nperience as it bears on the critical question of dis-\ncrimination.\u201d  Furnco Constr. Corp. v. Waters, 438 \nU.S. 567, 577 (1978). \nFactually, these flaws intersect with Ames\u2019s two \nclaimed acts of employment discrimination.  Recall \nthat she initially challenged both the Department\u2019s \ndecision to promote a different person and the De-\npartment\u2019s decision to demote her when it picked a \ndifferent person to fill Ames\u2019s former role.  Ames \nchallenged the promotion decision as illegal sexual-\norientation discrimination and challenged the demo-\ntion decision as both illegal sex and sexual-\norientation discrimination.  And while the Sixth Cir-\ncuit affirmed judgment against Ames on her orienta-\ntion theories for failing the prima facie inquiry with \nrespect to both her promotion and demotion claims, it \n\n9 \n \naffirmed \njudgment \nagainst \nher \non \nthe \nsex-\ndiscrimination theory because Ames could not show \nany pretext in the Department\u2019s decision to demote \nher and to select someone to replace her at her for-\nmer position.  See Pet.App.7a\u20138a.  The Sixth Circuit, \nthat is, rejected Ames\u2019s claim that the Department \ndiscriminated against her when it demoted her.   \nIn this Court, Ames\u2019s Question Presented targets \nonly a component of the prima facie showing.  The \nconsequence of that choice is that Ames cannot chal-\nlenge the Department\u2019s decision to demote her be-\ncause she has not challenged the lower court\u2019s hold-\nings that the demotion decision involved no pretext \n(and thus no discrimination).    \nWith that legal and factual setting, the following \nfour vehicle flaws point against granting review. \nA. \nAmes did not challenge the Sixth \nCircuit\u2019s prima facie test below. \nAmes never challenged the Sixth Circuit\u2019s \u201cback-\nground circumstances\u201d element below.  She argued \ninstead that she satisfied that requirement.  While \nAmes\u2019s litigation strategy may not have forfeited her \nQuestion Presented in the strictest sense, it still \nmakes this case a poor vehicle with which to consider \nthat question. \nThe Court has indicated that parties need not al-\nways raise their arguments for the first time in the \ncircuit courts.  It has noted that there is no require-\nment that a \u201cparty demand overruling of a squarely \napplicable, recent circuit precedent, even though that \nprecedent was established in a case to which the par-\nty itself was privy and over the party\u2019s vigorous ob-\njection.\u201d  United States v. Williams, 504 U.S. 36, 44 \n\n10 \n \n(1992); see also United States v. Vonn, 535 U.S. 55, \n58 (2002).   \nEven if Ames was not required to challenge exist-\ning Sixth Circuit precedent, she at least should not \nbe able to benefit from her failure to do so.  But that, \nin effect, is what she seeks to do.  As discussed in \nmore detail below, the Sixth Circuit has taken a nu-\nanced approach to determining whether a majority-\ngroup plaintiff has identified background circum-\nstances that suggest discrimination.  See below at \n23\u201324, 33\u201335.  Among other things, it has held that \nthe \u201c[background circumstances] requirement is not \nonerous, and can be met through a variety of means.\u201d  \nJohnson v. Metro. Gov\u2019t of Nashville & Davidson \nCnty., 502 F. App\u2019x 523, 536 (6th Cir. 2012).  Had \nAmes argued that such a requirement is inconsistent \nwith Title VII, then the Sixth Circuit would have had \nthe opportunity to discuss its precedent in greater \ndetail.  It could have explained, for example, that the \n\u201cbackground circumstances\u201d requirement is not a \nhigher burden, merely a different one.  But because \nAmes did not raise that issue, the panel had no rea-\nson to reject her framing of the background circum-\nstances element of the prima facie test.  Put another \nway, one of the reasons that Ames is now able to crit-\nicize the decision below as overly stringent and in-\nflexible is because she herself framed it that way.  \nAnd while that is not waiver or forfeiture formally, \nthe fact that Ames \u201cdid not raise or brief\u201d the ques-\ntion presented \u201cbelow\u201d is a reason to deny certiorari.  \nHoggard v. Rhodes, 141 S. Ct. 2421, 2422 (2021) \n(Thomas, J., respecting the denial of certiorari). \n\n11 \n \nB. \nAnswering the Question Presented \nin Ames\u2019s favor would not change \nthe outcome in this case because \nAmes cannot satisfy a separate \ncomponent of the prima facie \nshowing. \nAmes has affirmatively waived any challenge to \nthe requirement that she establish a prima facie case \nof discrimination.  Pet.28 n.3.  Her only challenge is \nto how the Sixth Circuit applied one component of \nthat rubric in this case.  Ames\u2019s Question Presented \nasks whether, to establish a prima facie case of dis-\ncrimination under Title VII, a majority-group plain-\ntiff must introduce evidence of \u201cbackground circum-\nstances\u201d that suggest discrimination.  See Pet.i.  But \nthe answer to that question will not affect the out-\ncome of this case.  Even if the answer is \u201cno\u201d Ames \nstill could not make a prima facie case of sex discrim-\nination.  And that is a prime reason to deny certiora-\nri.  The Court should \u201cnot ... take up\u201d a question pre-\nsented if the claims underlying that question are \u201cin-\ndependently subject to\u201d defenses that would yield the \nsame result regardless of how the Court answers the \nquestion.  Blankenship v. NBCUniversal, LLC, 144 S. \nCt. 5, 6 (2023) (Thomas, J., concurring in the denial \nof certiorari) \nThere appears to be universal agreement that an \n\u201cemployer cannot intentionally discriminate on the \nbasis of a characteristic of which the employer has no \nknowledge.\u201d  Bostock v. Clayton Cty., 590 U.S. 644, \n691 (2020) (Alito, J., dissenting).  As far as the De-\npartment is aware, every circuit that has considered \nthe question has held that in \u201ccases involving per-\nsonal attributes not obvious to the employer,\u201d a \n\n12 \n \n\u201cplaintiff cannot make out a prima facie case of dis-\ncrimination unless he or she proves that the employ-\ner knew about the plaintiff\u2019s particular personal \ncharacteristic.\u201d  Geraci v. Moody-Tottrup, Int\u2019l, 82 \nF.3d 578, 581 (3d Cir. 1996); Hunter v. UPS, 697 \nF.3d 697, 703\u201304 (8th Cir. 2012); Robinson v. Adams, \n847 F.2d 1315, 1316 (9th Cir. 1987); Lubetsky v. Ap-\nplied Card Sys., 296 F.3d 1301, 1305\u201306 (11th Cir. \n2002); cf. also Raytheon Co. v. Hernandez, 540 U.S. \n44, 54 n.7 (2003) (\u201cIf [an employer] were truly una-\nware that \u2026 a disability existed, it would be impos-\nsible for her hiring decision to have been based, even \nin part, on [the employee\u2019s] disability.\u201d); Landefel v. \nMarion Gen. Hosp., Inc., 994 F.2d 1178, 1181\u201382 (6th \nCir. 1993) (same).  The reverse is also true.  An em-\nployer cannot discriminate in favor of a different em-\nployee if the employer has no knowledge of the fa-\nvored employee\u2019s personal characteristics.  See, e.g., \nPetrikonis v. Wilkes-Barre Hosp. Co., LLC, 582 F. \nApp\u2019x 126, 130 (3d Cir. 2014); Morrow v. Wal\u2013Mart \nStores, Inc., 152 F.3d 559, 563 (7th Cir.1998). \nAmes, however, introduced no evidence that \nwould create a genuine issue of material fact about \nwhether the relevant decisionmakers were aware of \nher sexual orientation, or of the orientation of Fri-\nerson, the person who was ultimately hired for the \njob to which Ames had applied.  The only evidence on \nthat point indicated just the opposite.  The only evi-\ndence related to Walburn\u2019s knowledge with respect to \neither woman showed that she was unaware of Fri-\nerson\u2019s sexual orientation (and was silent with re-\nspect to Ames).  See Motion for Summary Judgment, \nR.71, PageID#2375 (citing Walburn Depo. R.60, \nPageID#668).  And the only evidence related to oth-\ners\u2019 knowledge of Ames\u2019s sexual orientation showed \n\n13 \n \nthat her direct supervisor did not know whether \nAmes was gay or straight.  See id. at 2367 (citing \nTrim Depo., R.64, PageID#1511).  Ames\u2019s failure to \nintroduce any evidence on this point means that no \nmatter how the Court answers the Question Present-\ned her discrimination claim would still fail at the \nprima facia stage.   \nTo be sure, the Sixth Circuit noted that, if not for \nthe background circumstances element, then Ames\u2019s \nprima facie case would have been \u201ceasy to make.\u201d  \nSee Pet.App.5a.  It is clear from context, however, \nthat the Sixth Circuit was referring only to the ele-\nments of a prima facie case discussed in McDonnell \nDouglas.  See id.  Knowledge of an employee\u2019s per-\nsonal characteristics is an additional, threshold, re-\nquirement of a prima facie case, however, and one \nthat the Sixth Circuit did not discuss.  See id.; \nGeraci, 82 F.3d at 581 (noting that McDonnell Doug-\nlas \u201cquite properly makes no reference to the em-\nployer\u2019s knowledge of membership in a protected \nclass\u201d because some protected traits will be known to \nmanagement merely by seeing the employee).     \nC. \nEven if Ames could establish a \nprima facie case of discrimination, \nthe outcome of this case still would \nnot change. \nA favorable answer to the Question Presented \nwould not change the result here for a second, inde-\npendent reason\u2014Ames\u2019s claim fails at the later stag-\nes of McDonnell Douglas.  Even if Ames could make \na prima facie case of discrimination, her promotion \nclaim would fail at McDonnell Douglas\u2019s second and \nthird stages.   \n\n14 \n \nThe Department had nondiscriminatory reasons \nfor its hiring decision and Ames cannot show that \nthose reasons were pretextual.  True, the concur-\nrence suggested otherwise below, Pet.App.10a, and \nAmes now makes a similar argument in her petition, \nsee Pet.32.  But they are both off base.  In response to \nthe Department\u2019s motion for summary judgment, \nAmes failed to point to any evidence that created a \ngenuine issue of material fact about whether the De-\npartment\u2019s decision to hire Frierson (instead of \nAmes) was pretextual.  Indeed, Ames did the oppo-\nsite.  She accepted the Department\u2019s recitation of the \nrelevant facts in its summary judgment motion as \ncorrect (with the exception of two minor issues that \nare not relevant here).  See Opposition to Motion for \nSummary Judgment, R.72, PageID#2488 n.1.   \nTo the extent that the concurrence below suggest-\ned that Ames\u2019s case faltered only at the prima facie \nshowing\u2019s step one, it was confused about the facts \nand evidence presented at summary judgment.  The \nconcurrence identified two factors that, it believed, \nprovided strong evidence of pretext: that the De-\npartment twice promoted a gay employee in a \u201cman-\nner adverse to Ames\u201d and that Frierson lacked the \nminimum qualifications for the job for which she was \nhired.  It was wrong on both counts. \nThe first factor\u2014which involved replacing Ames \nas the administrator of the Prison Rape Elimination \nAct program\u2014was irrelevant.  The Sixth Circuit held \nthat the Department had legitimate, nondiscrimina-\ntory, reasons for hiring Stojsavljevic, the other gay \nindividual that the concurrence referenced, for that \nposition, and Ames has not challenged that portion of \nthe Sixth Circuit\u2019s decision through her Question \n\n15 \n \nPresented.  Because it is now settled that the De-\npartment did not discriminate against Ames when it \nhired Stojsavljevic, that hiring decision cannot serve \nas evidence that the Department\u2019s other actions were \npretextual.  See Pet.12 n.2 (waiving any challenge to \nthe Sixth Circuit\u2019s sex discrimination ruling).   \nAs for the concurrence\u2019s second factor, it misread \nthe record when it stated that Frierson \u201clacked the \nminimum qualifications for the job\u201d for which she \nwas hired.  See Pet.App.10a.  The undisputed evi-\ndence showed that Frierson was qualified.  The job \nposting listed alternative qualifications: an applicant \nwas required to have either a college degree or rele-\nvant work experience.  Motion for Summary Judg-\nment, East Decl., R.71-4, PageID#2419.  And while \nFrierson did not have a degree, she did have the ex-\nperience.  Motion for Summary Judgment, East \nDecl., R.71-5, PageID#2460\u201368.  It was that experi-\nence, in fact, that led the Department to hire her.  \nWalburn Depo., R.60, PageID#635\u201337, 639.  Ames \nmay have argued in the Sixth Circuit that Frierson \nwas not qualified, but she did not introduce any evi-\ndence that created a genuine issue of material fact \nabout Frierson\u2019s qualifications.  Cf. Ames Opposition \nto Summary Judgment, R.72, PageID#2488 (conced-\ning that \u201c[t]he Statement of Facts included in the De-\nfendant\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment is largely \ncorrect\u201d).  Ames\u2019s argument was different in the dis-\ntrict court.  Ames never argued in the district court \nthat Frierson was unqualified.  See Opposition to \nMotion for Summary Judgment, R.72, PageID#2495\u2013\n96.  She argued only that she was more qualified \nthan Frierson was.  Id.  \n\n16 \n \nBecause the Sixth Circuit would likely \u201chave \nreached the same conclusion\u201d that the Department \nshould prevail on summary judgment even if it \nagreed with Ames, certiorari is unwarranted.  See, \ne.g., Hittson v. Chatman, 576 U.S. 1028 (2015) (Gins-\nburg, J., concurring in the denial of certiorari). \nD. \nAmes fails to distinguish between \nthe portion of the Sixth Circuit\u2019s \ndecision that she has challenged \nand the portion that she has not. \nThe Sixth Circuit below considered two separate \ndiscrimination claims and rejected them both.  It \nheld that Ames had failed to make a prima facie case \nof discrimination with respect to her promotion \nclaim.  It also held that Ames had failed to show that \nthe Department\u2019s decision to demote and replace her \nwas discriminatory.  Ames\u2019s demotion claim rested \non two theories of discrimination: sex and sexual ori-\nentation.  But although the Sixth Circuit held that \nAmes had established a prima facie case of discrimi-\nnation only with respect to her sex-discrimination \ntheory, that does not matter; the same nondiscrimi-\nnatory reasons were sufficient to resolve Ames\u2019s sex \nand sexual orientation theories.  Title VII claims \nchallenge employment actions.  See 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a72000e-2(a).  And, generally, the \u201csame legitimate, \nnondiscriminatory reasons that [an employer] ad-\nvance[d] against a finding of \u2026 discrimination apply \nequally to\u201d all similar claims of discrimination aris-\ning from the same event, even if the protected class \nthat provides the basis for the claim differs.  Cf. Hrd-\nlicka v. GM LLC, 63 F.4th 555, 575 (6th Cir. 2023). \nAmes has not challenged the portion of the Sixth \nCircuit\u2019s decision that held that the Department had \n\n17 \n \nnondiscriminatory reasons for demoting her.  The \nQuestion Presented therefore involves only Ames\u2019s \nclaim that the Department discriminated against her \nwhen it promoted Frierson instead of her.  See Pet.i.  \nIn other words, it involves only her promotion claim, \nnot her demotion claim.   \nAmes confuses the Question Presented in this \ncase by suggesting otherwise.  Ames writes that this \ncase involves a \u201cdemotion decision.\u201d  See Pet.32.  Not \nso.  The demotion decision she references involves \nthe demotion claim that she has not challenged \nthrough her Question Presented.  Ames\u2019s failure to \nproperly distinguish between the claim that is before \nthe court, and the one that is not, provides just one \nmore reason why this case provides a poor vehicle to \naddress the Question Presented.  \u201c[A]t the very least\u201d \nAmes\u2019s litigation strategy \u201cwould complicate [the \nCourt\u2019s] review.\u201d  Gordon Coll. v. DeWeese-Boyd, 142 \nS. Ct. 952 (2022) (Alito, J., respecting the denial of \ncertiorari).  And that is reason enough to deny certio-\nrari. \nII. \nThere is no meaningful circuit split; the \ndifferences between the circuits are \nlargely differences in language not law. \nThe Court should deny certiorari even if this \ncase\u2019s vehicle problems did not otherwise render it \nnon-cert worthy.  Ames claims to spy a circuit split \nwith respect to the relevant prima facie test for dis-\ncrimination claims brought by members of a majority \ngroup.  But any differences between the circuits are \nmore differences of terminology than consequential \nlegal substance.   Regardless of the long-standing dif-\nference in language that some circuits use, the out-\ncome is largely the same. \n\n18 \n \nA. \nThis Court\u2019s precedent instructs \nthat the McDonnell Douglas test is \na flexible one.  \nThis Court\u2019s decision in McDonnell Douglas pro-\nvides the foundation for a large majority of Title VII \nclaims.  Ames does not dispute that every circuit, \neven those that she alleges conflict with one another, \napplies that decision to at least some degree.  To the \nextent that Ames alleges that a split exists, it is a \nsplit over how the various circuits apply McDonnell \nDouglas.  Before addressing Ames\u2019s claimed split, \nsome background about that decision, and the \nCourt\u2019s precedent interpreting and applying it, is \ntherefore needed. \nBecause direct evidence of discrimination \u201c\u2018essen-\ntially requires an admission by the employer,\u2019 such \nevidence \u2018is rare.\u2019\u201d  Argyropoulos v. City of Alton, 539 \nF.3d 724, 733 (7th Cir. 2008) (citations omitted). \nThat is one reason why the Court adopted what is \nnow known as the McDonnell Douglas test.  Under \nthat test, a plaintiff may rely on indirect evidence to \nprove a discrimination claim.  The first step of \nMcDonnell Douglas\u2019s test requires a plaintiff to es-\ntablish a prima facie case of discrimination by show-\ning four things: \u201c(i) that he belongs to a racial minor-\nity; (ii) that he applied and was qualified for a job for \nwhich the employer was seeking applicants; (iii) that, \ndespite his qualifications, he was rejected; and (iv) \nthat, after his rejection, the position remained open \nand the employer continued to seek applicants from \npersons of complainant\u2019s qualifications.\u201d  McDonnell \nDouglas, 411 U.S. at 802.  But because \u201cfacts neces-\nsarily will vary in Title VII cases,\u201d the Court in \nMcDonnell Douglas acknowledged that the four-part \n\n19 \n \ntest it laid out will not apply \u201cin every respect to dif-\nfering factual situations.\u201d  Id. at 802 n.13.  Indeed, \npart one \u201cof this sample pattern of proof was set out \nonly to demonstrate how the racial character of the \ndiscrimination could be established in the most \ncommon sort of case, and not as an indication of any \nsubstantive limitation of Title VII\u2019s prohibition of ra-\ncial discrimination.\u201d  McDonald, 427 U.S. at 279 n.6 \n(1976) \nThe Court\u2019s subsequent decisions reaffirmed that \nMcDonnell Douglas was \u201c\u2018never intended to be rigid, \nmechanized, or ritualistic. Rather, it is merely a sen-\nsible, orderly way to evaluate the evidence in light of \ncommon experience as it bears on the critical ques-\ntion of discrimination.\u2019\u201d  USPS Bd. of Governors v. \nAikens, 460 U.S. 711, 715 (1983) (quoting Furnco, \n438 U.S. at 577).  The relevant question in Title VII \ncases is \u201calways whether the employer is treating \n\u2018some people less favorably than others because of \ntheir race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.\u2019\u201d \nFurnco, 438 U.S. at 577 (quoting Int\u2019l Brotherhood of \nTeamsters v. United States, 431 U.S. 324, 335 n.15 \n(1977)).  A plaintiff makes out a prima facie case of \ndiscrimination under McDonnell Douglas and Title \nVII by \u201cshowing actions taken by the employer from \nwhich one can infer, if such actions remain unex-\nplained, that it is more likely than not that such ac-\ntions were \u2018based on a discriminatory criterion illegal \nunder the Act.\u2019\u201d  Furnco, 438 U.S. at 576 (quoting \nTeamsters, 431 U.S. at 358); see also Young v. UPS, \n575 U.S. 206, 228 (2015) (same).  McDonnell Douglas \nis not an end in itself; it exists simply to eliminate \n\u201cthe most common nondiscriminatory reasons for the \nplaintiff\u2019s rejection.\u201d  Burdine, 450 U.S. at 253\u201354.   \n\n20 \n \nConsistent with the Court\u2019s precedent, lower \ncourts have modified McDonnell Douglas\u2019s test as \nnecessary to account for a specific plaintiff\u2019s discrim-\nination claims.  They have, for example, adopted \nmodified versions of the McDonnell Douglas test to \ngovern discriminatory promotion claims, Bundy v. \nJackson, 641 F.2d 934, 951 (D.C. Cir. 1981), retalia-\ntion claims, Laster v. City of Kalamazoo, 746 F.3d \n714, 730 (6th Cir. 2014), and discriminatory disci-\npline claims, Reives v. Illinois State Police, 29 F.4th \n887, 891\u201392 (7th Cir. 2022); see also Murray v. This-\ntledown Racing Club, Inc., 770 F.2d 63, 67 (6th Cir. \n1985) (noting that \u201ccourts have modified the McDon-\nnell Douglas standard to address disparate treat-\nment cases involving all discrimination prohibited by \nthe Act in promotion, firing, compensation or other \nconditions of employment\u201d). \nOne other modification involves claims by majori-\nty-group plaintiffs;  what some call \u201creverse\u201d discrim-\nination.  It is impossible to apply McDonnell Douglas \nliterally to such cases. The first prong of the McDon-\nnell Douglas prima facie test asks, after all, whether \nthe plaintiff was a \u201cracial minority.\u201d  McDonnell \nDouglas, 411 U.S. at 802; see also Parker v. Balti-\nmore & Ohio R. Co., 652 F.2d 1012, 1017 (D.C. Cir. \n1981).  Courts must therefore always adapt McDon-\nnell Douglas to at least some degree when they are \nconfronted with a \u201creverse\u201d discrimination claim.  \nThe Sixth Circuit, like many courts around the coun-\ntry, has adopted a prima facie test to govern discrim-\nination claims filed by members of a majority group \nwho allege that they were discriminated against in \nfavor of a minority group.  Those courts require a \nplaintiff who alleges discrimination based on the \nplaintiff\u2019s membership in a majority group to point to \n\n21 \n \nbackground circumstances that provide some evi-\ndence to \u201csupport the suspicion that the defendant is \nthat unusual employer who discriminates against the \nmajority.\u201d  Thistledown Racing, 770 F.2d at 67 (quot-\ning Parker, 652 F.2d at 1017).  This requirement is \noften shorthanded as simply a \u201cbackground circum-\nstances\u201d requirement.  But regardless of its label, a \nmajority plaintiff\u2019s burden, like the burden minority \nplaintiffs bear, is \u201cnot onerous.\u201d  Compare Johnson, \n502 F. App\u2019x at 536 with Burdine, 450 U.S. at 253. \nB. \nThere is no meaningful \ndisagreement between the circuits \nabout the ultimate legal standard \nthat McDonnell Douglas \nestablished. \nAmes argues that there is a split over how Courts \nhave applied McDonnell Douglas to \u201creverse\u201d dis-\ncrimination claims.  She groups the circuits into \nthree categories 1) circuits that have adopted a \n\u201cbackground circumstances\u201d requirement, 2) circuits \nthat she claims do not apply a \u201cbackground circum-\nstances\u201d requirement, and 3) circuits that have ex-\nplicitly rejected such a requirement.  See Pet.14\u201325  \nA close examination of the cases she cites reveals, \nhowever, that even though some circuits have used \ndifferent language to describe their approach, they \nultimately all focus on the same basic legal question: \nare there facts from which one can \u201cinfer, if such ac-\ntions remain unexplained, that it is more likely than \nnot that [an employer\u2019s] actions were based on a dis-\ncriminatory criterion illegal under\u201d Title VII.  \nFurnco, 438 U.S. at 576 (quotation omitted). \n\n22 \n \n1. \nIn \u201creverse\u201d discrimination \ncases, the Sixth, Seventh, \nEighth, Tenth, and D.C. \nCircuits describe the prima \nfacie case\u2019s first step as a \nshowing about background \ncircumstances. \nThe D.C. Circuit was one of the first courts to ap-\nply McDonnell Douglas to a \u201creverse\u201d discrimination \nclaim.  It noted that \u201c[m]embership in a socially dis-\nfavored group was the assumption on which the en-\ntire McDonnell Douglas analysis was predicated,\u201d \nand that the first element of the prima facie test \ntherefore necessarily needed to adapt when a mem-\nber of a majority group filed a Title VII claim.  Par-\nker, 652 F.2d at 1017   Applying a modified version of \nMcDonnell Douglas, it held that a plaintiff who is a \nmember of a majority group makes out a prima facie \nshowing of discrimination when she demonstrates \nthat \u201cbackground circumstances support the suspi-\ncion that the defendant is that unusual employer \nwho discriminates against the majority.\u201d  See id.  \nSuch circumstances, the D.C. Circuit wrote, \u201cserved \nas a functional equivalent of the first McDonnell \nDouglas criterion, membership in a racial minority.\u201d  \nId. at 1018.  Applying that standard, the court held \nthat the plaintiff in Parker made out a prima facie \ncase of discrimination when he pointed to a racially \ndiscriminatory work environment.  Id.  Subsequent \nD.C. Circuit decisions made clear that the \u201cback-\nground circumstances\u201d element is not intended to \ndisadvantage plaintiffs who are members of majority \ngroups, nor is it \u201can additional hurdle.\u201d  Harding v. \nGray, 9 F.3d 150, 153\u201354 (D.C. Cir. 1993).  It is simp-\nly a tool for \u201cdetermining when an employer\u2019s con-\n\n23 \n \nduct raises an inference of discrimination under the \nSupreme \nCourt\u2019s \nMcDonnell \nDouglas/Burdine \nstandard.\u201d  Id. at 153.  \nFollowing Parker, the Sixth, Seventh, Eighth, and \nTenth circuits have used the \u201cbackground circum-\nstances\u201d language to describe the first component of \na prima facie analysis for \u201creverse\u201d discrimination \nclaims.  Like the D.C. Circuit, however, those circuits \nhave emphasized that \u201cbackground circumstances\u201d \ncomponent is easily satisfied.  Most significantly for \npurposes of this case, the Sixth Circuit has held that \nthe background circumstances \u201crequirement is not \nonerous, and can be met through a variety of means.\u201d  \nJohnson, 502 F. App\u2019x at 536.  A male plaintiff in a \nfailure-to-hire case, for example, can satisfy the re-\nquirement by showing that the decisionmaker and \nthe person ultimately hired were both women.  See \nPet.App.6a.  He can demonstrate \u201cbackground cir-\ncumstances,\u201d in other words, by showing that he was \nin the minority in the relevant sense. \nThe Sixth Circuit\u2019s recent decisions, which make \nclear that a plaintiff\u2019s burden is not onerous, also put \nto rest any concerns in older Sixth Circuit decisions \nthat majority-group plaintiffs may bear a high bur-\nden.  See Pierce v. Commonwealth Life Ins. Co., 40 \nF.3d 796, 801 n.7 (6th Cir. 1994); cf. Briggs v. Porter, \n463 F.3d 507, 517 (6th Cir. 2006) (describing a plain-\ntiff\u2019s burden as \u201cmore difficult\u201d).  To the extent that \nthe Sixth Circuit in past decades may have expressed \nmisgivings about the \u201cbackground circumstances\u201d \nanalysis, its more recent decisions have clarified the \nshowing\u2019s low bar.  See Johnson, 502 F. App\u2019x at 536. \nThe Seventh, Eighth, and Tenth Circuits also do \nnot treat the background circumstances requirement \n\n24 \n \nas onerous.  They too look to it as nothing more than \na substitute for otherwise inapplicable elements of \nthe prima facie test discussed in McDonnell Douglas.  \nThe Seventh Circuit, in adopting a background cir-\ncumstances requirement, emphasized that the re-\nquirement \u201cis not to be interpreted in a constricting \nfashion.\u201d  Mills v. Health Care Serv. Corp., 171 F.3d \n450, 457 (7th Cir. 1999).  And the Eighth Circuit and \nTenth Circuits have likewise treated the background \ncircumstances component of a prima facie case not as \na \u201chigher\u201d or \u201cadditional\u201d burden, but simply an al-\nternative showing that plaintiffs must make \u201cin lieu \nof\u201d showing that the plaintiff belongs to a minority \ngroup.  Notari v. Denver Water Dep\u2019t., 971 F.2d 585, \n589 (10th Cir. 1992); Hammer v. Ashcroft, 383 F.3d \n722, 724 (8th Cir. 2004); see also Duffy v. Wolle, 123 \nF.3d 1026, 1035\u201337 (8th Cir. 1997) (applying \nMcDonnell Douglas framework to a Bivens v. Six \nUnknown Fed. Narcotics Agents, 403 U.S. 388, (1971) \nclaim). \nMost significantly, none of the circuits that use \nthe \u201cbackground circumstances\u201d language dispute \nthat plaintiffs who are members of a majority group \nare \u201centitled to the same Title VII protection as a \nminority plaintiff.\u201d  Harding, 9 F.3d at 153; see also \nThistledown Racing, 770 F.2d at 67 (\u201cTitle VII, of \ncourse, prohibits racial discrimination against all \ngroups\u201d); Mills, 171 F.3d at 454\u201355 (\u201c[I]t is well set-\ntled law that the protections of Title VII are not lim-\nited to members of historically discriminated-against \ngroups.\u201d); Schaffhauser v. UPS, 794 F.3d 899, 902 \n(8th Cir. 2015) (\u201cTitle VII prohibits an employer from \ndiscriminating against any individual \u2018because of \nsuch individual\u2019s race.\u2019\u201d (emphasis added)); Notari, \n971 F.2d at 588 (noting that \u201cit is clear that Title \n\n25 \n \nVII\u2019s protection is not limited to those individuals \nwho are members of historically or socially disfa-\nvored groups\u201d). \n2. \nThe Third and Eleventh \nCircuits are in accord with \nthe other circuits. \nAmes argues that there is a direct conflict be-\ntween the Third and Eleventh Circuits and those cir-\ncuits that apply a \u201cbackground circumstances\u201d re-\nquirement as part of the prima facie test for \u201creverse\u201d \ndiscrimination claims.  The Third and Eleventh cir-\ncuits, she claims have \u201cexplicitly rejected\u201d such a re-\nquirement.  Pet.19.  Ames overreads those decisions.  \nWhile the Third and Eleventh Circuits have chosen \nnot to apply an explicit \u201cbackground circumstances\u201d \nrequirement, those circuits still apply the same basic \nTitle VII standard that other circuits apply. \nThe Third Circuit, it is true, has declined to adopt \nthe \u201cbackground circumstances\u201d language in \u201cre-\nverse\u201d discrimination cases.  Iadimarco v. Runyon, \n190 F.3d 151, 160 (3d Cir. 1999).  But it has never-\ntheless recognized that there are problems with the \n\u201cwording of the very first prong of the McDonnell \nDouglas [prima facie] test\u201d that mandate at least \nsome modification of that test with respect to \u201cre-\nverse\u201d discrimination claims.  Id. at 158.  Rather \nthan use the language of \u201cbackground circumstanc-\nes,\u201d however, it has held that a Title VII plaintiff \n\u201cshould be able to establish a prima facie case \u2026 by \npresenting sufficient evidence to allow a reasonable \nfact finder to conclude (given the totality of the cir-\ncumstances) that the defendant treated [a] plaintiff \n\u2018less favorably than others because of [his] race, col-\nor, religion, sex, or national origin.\u2019\u201d  Id. at 163 (quot-\n\n26 \n \ning Furnco, 438 U.S. at 577).  That is not meaning-\nfully different from the legal standard that other cir-\ncuits apply.  The Third Circuit in fact acknowledged \nthat the background-circumstances requirement, as \napplied by the circuits that have adopted it, often re-\nquires only that a plaintiff offer \u201csufficient evidence \nto support the reasonable probability of discrimina-\ntion.\u201d  Id. at 162. \nAt least one member of the Iadimarco panel be-\nlieved the primary difference between the test that \nthe Third Circuit adopted and the \u201cbackground cir-\ncumstances\u201d test was their wording and that the \nThird Circuit\u2019s test was \u201cmerely a restatement of the \nMcDonnell Douglas test.\u201d  Id. at 163 n.10.  That \nmember of the panel rejected the \u201cbackground cir-\ncumstances\u201d phrasing not because it was necessarily \nan incorrect statement of law, but because its fram-\ning was \u201cjust too vague and too prone to misinterpre-\ntation and confusion to apply fairly and consistently.\u201d  \nId.   \nThe other Third Circuit decisions that Ames cites \nalso do not support her claimed split.  The Third Cir-\ncuit did not discuss \u201cbackground circumstances\u201d at \nall in Phillips v. Legacy Cabinets, 87 F.4th 1313 \n(11th Cir. 2023).  Even if it had, it would not have \nmattered.  Because the plaintiff and the relevant de-\ncisionmaker were of different races, see id. at 1316, \nthe plaintiff would have been able to demonstrate \nbackground \ncircumstances \nin \nany \nevent, \nsee \nPet.App.5a.  Ellis v. Bank of N.Y. Mellon Corp, is \neven less relevant; all that the Third Circuit did in \nthat case was state the obvious proposition that a \n\u201creverse\u201d discrimination plaintiff \u201cneed not show she \n\n27 \n \nis a member of a minority group.\u201d  837 F. App\u2019x 940, \n941 n.3 (2021). \nThe Eleventh Circuit decisions that Ames cites \nare of even less relevance.  Two of the cases did not \ninvolve McDonnell Douglas\u2019s prima facie test at all.  \nBass v. Bd. of County Comm\u2019rs, 256 F.3d 1095, 1104  \n(11th Cir. 2001) (\u201cIn this case, the County has not \ndisputed that Bass established a prima facie case of \ndiscrimination under the McDonnell Douglas frame-\nwork.\u201d); Smith v. Lockheed-Martin Corp., 644 F.3d \n1321, 1328 (11th Cir. 2011) (\u201cHere, Mitten did not \nneed to rely on the McDonnell Douglas presumption \nto establish a case for the jury.\u201d).  Any discussion of \nthe \u201cbackground circumstances\u201d element in those de-\ncisions was therefore dicta.  But even then, to the ex-\ntent that the Eleventh District in Bass \u201cexplicitly\u201d \nrejected anything, it was the \u201creverse discrimination\u201d \nlabel.  See Bass, 256 F.3d at 1102\u201303.  Its decision, in \nthat respect, was little more than an uncontroversial \nrecognition that Title VII applies equally to all plain-\ntiffs.  See id.  And Smith, for its part, simply cited \nBass for the principle that a plaintiff need not show \n\u201cbackground circumstances\u201d that suggest discrimina-\ntion.  See 644 F.3d at 1325 n.15.  But if Bass did not \ndecide that question, then neither can it be said did \nSmith. \nDicta aside, the legal test that the Eleventh Cir-\ncuit applied in Smith is, in practice, functionally sim-\nilar to the test that other circuits apply.  It held that \na plaintiff can prevail on a discrimination claim if \n\u201cthe record, viewed in a light most favorable to the \nplaintiff, presents \u2018a convincing mosaic of circum-\nstantial evidence that would allow a jury to infer in-\ntentional discrimination by the decisionmaker.\u2019\u201d  \n\n28 \n \nSmith, 644 F.3d at 1328.  And in other cases, the \nEleventh Circuit has held that its \u201cmosaic\u201d standard \naddresses the same question as \u201cwhen using the \nMcDonnell Douglas framework.\u201d  Tynes v. Fla. Dep\u2019t \nof Juvenile Justice, 88 F.4th 939, 947 (2023).  To be \nsure, some members of the Eleventh Circuit would go \neven further and would abandon McDonnell Douglas \ncompletely.  See id. at 949\u201358 (Newsome, J., concur-\nring).  But whether McDonnell Douglas has outlived \nits usefulness is a question that must wait for anoth-\ner day\u2014and for a party to raise it.  Ames has explic-\nitly declined to do so here.  See Pet.28 n.3. \n3. \nThe First, Second, Fourth, \nFifth, and Ninth Circuits \napply a largely similar prima \nfacie standard. \nAmes identifies two different categories of circuits \nthat, she claims, have implicitly rejected a back-\nground circumstances requirement: those that have \ndeclined to decide whether to apply such a require-\nment and those that have been entirely silent on the \nquestion.  See Pet.22\u201323.   \na. The Second, Fourth, and Ninth Circuits are in \nthe first category of cases.  They have acknowledged \nthe \u201cbackground circumstances\u201d requirement but \nhave not decided whether such a requirement should \nbe part of the prima facie test for \u201creverse\u201d discrimi-\nnation claims.  The fact that they have not taken a \nposition on the Question Presented means, by defini-\ntion, that they are not part of any circuit split.  That \nbeing said, however, the test that those circuits have \napplied is not meaningfully different from the test \nthat other circuits apply.  Like the Sixth, Seventh, \nEighth, Tenth, and D.C. Circuits, the Second, \n\n29 \n \nFourth, and Ninth Circuits all ask whether a plain-\ntiff has pointed to facts that would suggest the pres-\nence of discrimination. \nRather than linger on the framing of the \u201cback-\nground circumstances\u201d requirement, the Second Cir-\ncuit has focused on the ultimate question that \nMcDonnell Douglas was designed to address.  The \nrelevant question for any discrimination claim, it has \nnoted, is whether the events that give rise to a plain-\ntiff\u2019s complaint occurred \u201cunder circumstances which \ngive rise to an inference of unlawful discrimination.\u201d  \nAulicino v. New York Dep\u2019t of Homeless Servs., 580 \nF.3d 73, 80 (2d Cir. 2009) (quotation omitted).  In the \n\u201cconflict\u201d case that Ames cites, the Second Circuit \nheld that it did not need to decide whether to de-\nmand evidence of \u201cbackground circumstances\u201d be-\ncause the plaintiff\u2019s evidence sufficiently demon-\nstrated those circumstances, even if that require-\nment applied.  Id. at 80 n.5.   \nThe Fourth Circuit has adopted a similar ap-\nproach.  It has held that plaintiffs in all discrimina-\ntion cases must point to \u201csome evidence that race \nwas a determining factor in the employer\u2019s decision.\u201d  \nHolmes v. Bevilacqua, 794 F.2d 142, 147 (4th 1986) \n(en banc).  And while it has \u201cexpressly decline[d] to \ndecide \u2026 whether a higher burden\u201d applies to plain-\ntiffs who bring a \u201creverse\u201d discrimination claim, it \nhas held that the burden that its precedent calls for \nis not meaningfully different from the standard that \nthe D.C. Circuit discussed in Parker.  Lucas v. Dole, \n835 F.2d 532, 533\u201334 & n.9 (4th Cir. 1987) (emphasis \nadded). \nFinally, the Ninth Circuit fits into this category \nas well.  In an unpublished decision, it also chose not \n\n30 \n \nto weigh in on how the first component of the \nMcDonnell Douglas prima facie test should be modi-\nfied when faced with a \u201creverse\u201d discrimination \nclaim.  Zottola v. City of Oakland, 32 F. App\u2019x 307, \n311 (9th Cir. 2002).  The plaintiff\u2019s claim in that case, \nthe court held, failed with or without a \u201cbackground \ncircumstances\u201d requirement.  Id. at 311.  The only \nother Ninth Circuit decision that Ames cites also did \nnot address the Question Presented here.  The court \nin that case asked the same question that all other \ncircuits ask: did the plaintiffs provide evidence that \n\u201cgives rise to an inference of unlawful discrimina-\ntion\u201d?  See Hawn v. Exec. Jet Mgmt., 615 F.3d 1151, \n1156 (9th Cir. 2010) (quotation omitted). \nb. The First and Fifth Circuits belong to the sec-\nond category of circuits that Ames identifies: those \nthat have not discussed the \u201cbackground circum-\nstances\u201d element at all.  Like the circuits that have \nexpressly declined to decide whether or how to adjust \nMcDonnell Douglas\u2019s prima facie elements to account \nfor \u201creverse\u201d discrimination claims, the silence of the \nFirst and Fifth Circuits means that they cannot be \nproperly said to conflict with the other circuits.  And \neven though the First and Fifth Circuits have not \naddressed whether a \u201cbackground circumstances\u201d el-\nement is part of the prima facie test for \u201creverse\u201d dis-\ncrimination claims, the legal standard that they ap-\nply is still consistent with the standard that courts \nthat have adopted such a component apply.   \nThe First Circuit in Williams v. Raytheon Co., 220 \nF.3d 16 (1st Cir. 2000), for example, stated that the \nburden of establishing a prima facie case under \nMcDonnell Douglas is \u201cnot onerous.\u201d  Id. at 19.  To \nthe extent that the First Circuit did not discuss the \n\n31 \n \ncomponents of the prima facie test in greater detail, \nthat is because, after briefly discussing those ele-\nments, it largely \u201cput[] aside\u201d those elements and \u201cas \n[it has] often done,\u201d turned \u201cto whether there is evi-\ndence that, notwithstanding the employer\u2019s stated \nreasons for the termination, the real reason, at least \nin part, was \u2026 discrimination.\u201d  See Fontanez-Nunez \nv. Janssen Ortho, LLC, 447 F.3d 50, 56 (1st Cir. \n2006) (quotation omitted).  That is, it focused on the \nquestion of pretext.  Having done so, it held that the \nplaintiff\u2019s claim failed because his evidence did not \n\u201csupport a reasonable inference that [the employer] \nacted out of a discriminatory purpose.\u201d  Williams, \n220 F.3d at 20. \n The Fifth Circuit\u2019s approach in Byers v. Dallas \nMorning News, Inc., 209 F.3d 419 (5th Cir. 2000) is \nsimilar.  Like the First Circuit in Williams, it also \ndid not discuss a \u201cbackground circumstances\u201d ap-\nproach to the prima facie test like the one that some \ncircuits have used.  See id. 425\u201327.  It asked instead \nwhether the plaintiff had carried his burden of pro-\nducing \u201csufficient evidence indirectly demonstrating \ndiscriminatory intent.\u201d  Id. at 427.  The plaintiff in \nWilliams had not done so, the Fifth Circuit held, be-\ncause the only evidence of discrimination he had of-\nfered was \u201chis subjective belief.\u201d  Id.  The Fifth Cir-\ncuit\u2019s requirement that a plaintiff introduce enough \nindirect evidence to suggest a discriminatory motive \nis not meaningfully different from the \u201cbackground \ncircumstances\u201d requirement that other circuits have \nadopted.  The main difference is the label that those \ncircuits have assigned to that element of the prima \nfacie test. \n\n32 \n \nC. \nDistrict court uncertainty is not a \nreason to grant Ames\u2019s petition for \na writ of certiorari. \nHaving failed to make a compelling case that the \ncircuits are divided in a way that meaningfully af-\nfects the outcome of Title VII cases, Ames turns to \nthe district courts.  But even if she is right that some \ndistrict courts are confused about how to apply \nMcDonnell Douglas\u2019s test to \u201creverse\u201d discrimination \nclaims, the remedy for that confusion is further re-\nview in the circuit courts.  Those courts, not this one, \nare best suited to resolve any district court uncer-\ntainty or disagreement.  See Stephen Shapiro, et al., \nSupreme Court Practice, 505 (10th ed. 2013) (federal \ndistrict court conflicts \u201ccan be eliminated by the \ncourts of appeals\u201d); see also S. Ct. Prac. R. 10 (focus-\ning on United States courts of appeals decisions \nwhen considering whether certiorari is warranted).   \n* \n* \n* \nAt bottom, the circuits\u2019 slight variations in ap-\nproaching \u201creverse\u201d discrimination claims involves \nan almost-never-dispositive difference that largely \nboils down to differing verbal formulations.  And \nthose differences cropped up decades ago.  If this is a \nsplit at all, it is stale and largely irrelevant.    \nIII. \nThe Sixth Circuit faithfully applied this \nCourt\u2019s precedent when it held that Ames \nhad not made out a prima facie case of \ndiscrimination. \nRegardless of whether a circuit split exists, the \nSixth Circuit faithfully applies this Court\u2019s precedent \nwhen reviewing Title VII claims.  It has recognized \nthat \u201cTitle VII, of course, prohibits racial discrimina-\n\n33 \n \ntion against all groups.\u201d  Thistledown Racing, 770 \nF.2d at 67 (citing McDonald, 427 U.S. at 276, 279 \n(1976)).  The \u201cbackground circumstances\u201d element \nthat it applies to \u201creverse\u201d discrimination claims re-\nflects this Court\u2019s own focus on whether a plaintiff\u2019s \nallegations \u201c\u2018if otherwise unexplained, are more like-\nly than not based on the consideration of impermis-\nsible factors.\u2019\u201d  Burdine, 450 U.S. at 254 (quoting \nFurnco, 438 U.S. at 577).  And just like this Court \nhas held that McDonnell Douglas\u2019s prima facie \nstandard \u201cwas \u2018never intended to be rigid, mecha-\nnized, or ritualistic,\u2019\u201d Aikens, 460 U.S. at 715, the \nSixth Circuit has recognized that its \u201cbackground \ncircumstances\u201d requirement is \u201cnot onerous\u201d and \nmay be satisfied \u201cthrough a variety of means,\u201d John-\nson, 502 F. App\u2019x at 536. \nTo the extent that the panel\u2019s decision in this case \ncan be read as inflexibly applying a \u201cbackground cir-\ncumstances\u201d requirement, that is likely because of \nthe way Ames chose to litigate her appeal.  She did \nnot challenge the \u201cbackground circumstances\u201d re-\nquirement in any way and, by arguing that she had \ndemonstrated background circumstances, implicitly \naccepted it.  See, Ames Br., App.R.21 at 17\u201320.  In \ndoing so, she offered two reasons why background \ncircumstances existed: the identity of the deci-\nsionmaker (an argument that the panel held she had \nforfeited, see Pet.App.6a) and her own experiences.  \nSee id.  The fact that the panel focused solely on \nthose elements shows only that it engaged with \nAmes\u2019s arguments and wanted to succinctly dispose \nof her claims.  That the panel did not more thorough-\nly discuss an issue that neither of the parties had \nraised is, at most, a drafting issue that does not cre-\n\n34 \n \nate a circuit split\u2014let alone warrant this Court\u2019s re-\nview. \nThis case shows why all plaintiffs, including those \nwho bring \u201creverse\u201d discrimination claims, must \nmake some threshold showing that suggests discrim-\nination.  And it shows why, even if the circuit split \nthat Ames purports to identify exists, there is no \nmeaningful split about the outcome of this case.  The \nacid test for cert-worthiness is whether a case would \ncome out different in different circuits.  This case \nwould not.  \nAmes\u2019s evidence in this case was this: She was a \nwoman who did not receive a job for which she quali-\nfied and to which she had applied.  Walburn, one of \nthe individuals who was responsible for hiring for \nthat job, was also a woman.  And the person who was \nultimately hired for the job was also a woman\u2014and \nwas qualified for the position.  The woman who was \nhired was gay, however, and Ames was not.   \nAmes did not identify any evidence that suggest-\ned sexual orientation played any role in the hiring \ndecision, however.  She did not point to any evidence \nindicating that the relevant decisionmakers were \ngay.  Nor did she point to any evidence suggesting \nthat the decisionmakers knew the sexual orientation \nof either Ames or of the woman that they ultimately \nhired.  She instead conceded in the district court that \nthe Department\u2019s statement of the facts was correct.  \nSee Opposition to Motion for Summary Judgment, \nR.72, PageID#2488 n.1.  Without such evidence, \nthere is nothing that \u201craises an inference of discrimi-\nnation \u2026 if otherwise unexplained.\u201d  See Burdine, \n450 U.S. at 254 (quotation omitted).  Thus, under \nany formulation of McDonnell Douglas\u2019s prima facie \n\n35 \n \ntest, Ames\u2019s claim would fail.  If the Court were to \nhold otherwise, and if it were to hold that Ames es-\ntablished a prima facie case of discrimination in this \ncase anyway, then McDonnell Douglas\u2019s prima facie \nscreening test will have lost almost all of its mean-\ning.  \nCONCLUSION \nThe Court should deny the petition for a writ of \ncertiorari.  \n \nRespectfully submitted, \n \nDAVE YOST \nAttorney General of Ohio \nMICHAEL J.

          "task_beliefs": "My model of this case remains centered on the critical tension between the petitioner's framing of a clean circuit split and the respondent's powerful \"poor vehicle\" arguments. My prediction for a cert grant is stable at a **low-to-medium probability**, entirely contingent on the petitioner's ability to rebut the procedural and factual challenges raised in the Brief in Opposition (BIO).\n\nThe core of my belief structure, built from the BIO, is that the case suffers from three potentially fatal flaws:\n1.  **Preservation Failure:** The argument that Ames did not challenge the \"background circumstances\" test in lower courts presents a significant jurisdictional hurdle.\n2.  **Lack of Outcome-Determinacy:** The respondent's claims that Ames would lose regardless of the Court's ruling on the Question Presented (due to unchallenged pretext findings and decision-maker ignorance) suggest a ruling would be an impermissible advisory opinion.\n3.  **Superficial Circuit Split:** The respondent's characterization of the split as one of \"language not law\" diminishes the urgency for the Court to intervene.\n\nMy previous observation\u2014a failed search for the petitioner's reply brief\u2014confirmed that the key evidence needed to resolve my primary uncertainty is not yet available. The case remains in a state of \"active waiting.\"\n\nThe latest observation, which is my own internal reasoning, does not alter the substantive analysis but significantly refines my understanding of the case's procedural timeline. By identifying **Supreme Court Rule 15.3**, I now know the specific rule governing the next filing: the petitioner's reply brief is due 14 days after the BIO was filed. This transforms my uncertainty from a vague \"when will the brief be filed?\" into a precise, answerable question: \"On what date was the BIO filed?\" This procedural knowledge allows me to calculate the exact deadline and anticipate when the critical evidence will emerge. My prediction remains unchanged, but my model of the case's immediate future is now more structured and less speculative. The minor uncertainty about whether a reply would be filed at all is now bounded by a specific, calculable deadline.",

This prevents wasted actions and makes information gathering more efficient.\n\nThe latest observation\u2014my own thought process\u2014provides strong validation for Heuristic #13. It demonstrates the shift from a reactive search (\"Is the brief there yet?\") to a proactive, structured inquiry (\"When is the brief *due*?\"). This reflection adds a concrete piece of knowledge that enhances Heuristic #6: I now know that **Supreme Court Rule 15.3** dictates a 14-day deadline for reply briefs. This specific rule is a powerful tool that can be generalized to all future cert-stage analyses. My design has evolved to incorporate a multi-step information-gathering plan: instead of directly seeking a future document, the more effective strategy is to first seek the predicate information (the prior document's filing date) that allows for a precise calculation of the target document's deadline. This represents a maturation of my ability to execute Heuristic #5, refining the \"target\" for uncertainty reduction to be more precise and actionable."

My design has matured from simply knowing the sequence of filings to actively using procedural rules to build a predictive timeline and guide my actions."

After \nbeing required to undergo and personally adopt the \nprinciples of aggressive \u201cEquity, Diversity, and \nInclusion Training,\u201d he resigned his position in the \nLimon Correctional Facility. See Young v. Colorado \nDepartment of Corrections, 94 F.4th 1242, 1244 (10th \nCir. 2024) (\u201cAfter resigning from the Department \nbecause of the training program, Mr. Young sued, \nasserting claims under Title VII and the Equal \nProtection Clause.\u201d). \nWhen Mr. Young brought suit under Title VII \nagainst the Colorado Department of Corrections, that \nagency defended itself from liability by alleging that \nMr. Young had not adequately stated a claim because \nof his race\u2014Caucasian. See Defendants\u2019 Motion to \nDismiss, \nYoung \nv. \nColorado \nDepartment \nof \nCorrections, No. 1:22-cv-00145-NYW-KLM, 2022 WL \n19569770 (2022) (\u201cThis enhancement of the first \nprima facie element reflects courts\u2019 recognition that \nmembers of the majority group are not necessarily \nentitled to a presumption of discrimination.\u201d). \n \n1 Per Supreme Court Rule 37.6, Amicus affirms that no counsel \nfor any party authored this brief in whole or in part, and no \ncounsel or party made a monetary contribution intended to fund \nthe preparation or submission of this brief. No person other than \namici curiae, their members, or their counsel made a monetary \ncontribution to its preparation or submission. \n\n \n2 \nThe District Court, although it granted the \nmotion to dismiss for other reasons, emphasized the \ncontinuing vitality of differential pleading standards \nfor Caucasian plaintiffs in Title VII actions within the \nTenth Circuit Court of Appeals. See Young v. Colorado \nDep\u2019t of Corrections, No. 22-cv-00145-NYW-KLM, \n2023 WL 1437894, at *4 (D. Colo. Feb. 1, 2023) (\u201cIn \nNotari v. Denver Water Department, 971 F.2d 585 \n(1992), the Tenth Circuit first recognized that when a \nplaintiff is tasked with establishing an inference of \ndiscrimination and \u2018is a member of a historically \nfavored group, an inference of invidious intent is \nwarranted only when \u2018background circumstances \nsupport the suspicion that the defendant is that \nunusual employer who discriminates against the \nmajority.\u2019\u201d) (emphasis added).  \nMr. Young finds this differential treatment \nbased on his race\u2014which constitutes open race \ndiscrimination \nby \nthe \njudiciary\u2014fundamentally \nrepugnant to the Constitution\u2019s promise of Equal \nProtection, the text of Title VII, and our country\u2019s \n\n \n3 \nfoundational principles of equality. He therefore \nsubmits this brief in support of Petitioner.2  \nSUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT \nLike the Petitioner, Ms. Ames, Amicus Josh \nYoung suffered discrimination at the hands of his \nemployer based on a protected characteristic. And \nthere is little doubt that the Equal Protection Clause \nof the Fourteenth Amendment, properly construed, \nrequires Courts to treat all parties before them in \ncolorblind manner. Yet, some Courts are treating both \nparties and attorneys differently based solely on a \nperson\u2019s race. It is therefore not enough for this Court \nto issue a modest, corrective opinion, merely stating \nthat lower courts ought to do a better job of applying \nthe text of Title VII, and ensuring that these courts do \nnot add elements to a claim. Indeed, this Court has \nalready done that. See McDonald v. Santa Fe Trail \nTransp. Co., 427 U.S. 273, 280 (1976) (\u201cWe therefore \nhold \ntoday \nthat \nTitle \nVII \nprohibits \nracial \ndiscrimination against the white petitioners in this \ncase upon the same standards as would be applicable \nwere they Negroes and Jackson white.\u201d); Cf. Muldrow \n \n2 To be clear, the Tenth Circuit affirmed the dismissal, without \nprejudice, of Mr. Young\u2019s complaint. See 94 F.4th 1251 (\u201cWhile \nMr. Young asserts that he experienced severe and pervasive \nharassment, \u2026 he does not allege specific facts that demonstrate \nhow the training related to his actual workplace experience.\u201d). \nMr. Young has subsequently filed a new action bolstering his \nallegations of discrimination under Title VII and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 \n1981. See Young v. Colorado Department of Corrections, 23-cv-\n01688-NYW-SBP (D. Colo., Filed June 30, 2023). \n\n \n4 \nv. City of St. Louis, Mo., 601 U.S. 346 (2024). \nSo this is no time for judicial minimalism. \nInstead, this Court should issue a broad and robust \nopinion calling into question every practice where \ncourts treat litigants or their counsel differently based \non race, and reiterate once again the principle that \neveryone is equal before the law.  \nARGUMENT \nJust last year, this Court made a bold \nstatement on behalf of equality under the law in \nStudents for Fair Admissions, Inc. v. Pres. and \nFellows of Harvard College, 600 U.S. 181 (2023) \n(SFFA). In rejecting the University of North \nCarolina\u2019s racial preferences in its student admission \nprocess, the Court criticized UNC\u2019s chief argument in \nfavor of \u201cdiversity\u201d: \u201c[UNC] argues that race in itself \n\u2018says something about who you are.\u2019\u201d Id. at 220 \n(internal \nbrackets \nomitted). \nIn \nholding \nthat \naffirmative action was unconstitutional, and by \nrejecting this argument, the Court made one of its \nclearest statements yet on racial equality: \u201cWe have \ntime and again forcefully rejected the notion that \ngovernment \nactors \nmay \nintentionally \nallocate \npreference to those who may have little in common \nwith one another but the color of their skin.\u201d Id. \n(internal quotation marks omitted). \nThe Court\u2019s statements in SFFA were not \nconfined to schools, or even legislatures. Courts too \nplay a role in upholding these principles. See SFFA, \n600 U.S. at 206 (2023) (\u201cAnd the Equal Protection \nClause, we have accordingly held, applies without \n\n \n5 \nregard to any differences of race, of color, or of \nnationality\u2014it is universal in its application.\u201d) \n(emphasis added). And as the Chief Justice noted \nduring oral argument in SFFA, we did not fight a civil \nwar over oboe players. See Oral Argument Transcript \nof Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard, 20-1199, \n67:22 \u2013 68:3-4 (Oct. 31, 2022) (Mr. Waxman: \u201cRace \u2026 \nfor some highly qualified applicants can be the \ndeterminative factor, just as being \u2026 an oboe player \nin a year in which the Harvard-Radcliffe orchestra \nneeds an oboe player [can be]\u2026 Chief Justice Roberts: \n\u201cYeah. We did not fight a Civil War about oboe \nplayers.\u201d).3  \nRather, this nation embarked on a dramatic \nReconstruction effort after the Civil War in order to \nensure that justice was blind. As this Court recently \narticulated: \nIt must become the heritage of our Nation to \nrise above racial classifications that are so \ninconsistent with our commitment to the \nequal dignity of all persons. This imperative \nto \npurge \nracial \nprejudice \nfrom \nthe \nadministration of justice was given new force \nand direction by the ratification of the Civil \nWar Amendments. \nPena-Rodriguez v. Colorado, 580 U.S. 206, 221 (2017) \n \n3 \nhttps://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_trans\ncripts/2022/20-1199_bi7a.pdf \n\n \n6 \n(emphasis added).  \nHowever, courts across the country are \nengaging in widespread efforts to treat the parties \nbefore them differently, depending on race. These \ninstances, like the underlying issue in this case, \nbetray the ideals of the nation. Amicus Mr. Young \ntherefore asks the Court to issue a broad, sweeping \nruling calling into question judicial efforts to treat the \nparties before them differently based on race. See \nBatson v. Kentucky, 476 U.S. 79, 87-88 (1986) \n(\u201cDiscrimination within the judicial system is most \npernicious\u2026\u201d); see also Edmonson v. Leesville \nConcrete Co., Inc., 500 U.S. 614, 628 (1991) (\u201cRace \ndiscrimination within the courtroom raises serious \nquestions as to the fairness of the proceedings \nconducted there.\u201d). \nI. \nThe Equal Protection Clause Demands a \nColor-Blind Judicial System. \nThe Constitution demands equality before the \nlaw, regardless of the race of the individual. Courts do \nthe nation a disservice when they play a part in \nunequal treatment on account of race. Edmondson, \n500 U.S. at 628 (\u201cFew places are a more real \nexpression of the constitutional authority of the \ngovernment than a courtroom, where the law itself \nunfolds.\u201d); see also SFFA, 600 U.S. at 203 (\u201cThis Court \nplayed its own role in that ignoble history, allowing in \nPlessy v. Ferguson the separate but equal regime that \nwould come to deface much of America.\u201d); Plessy v. \nFerguson, 163 U.S. 537, 554 (1896) (Harlan, J., \ndissenting) (\u201cIn respect of civil rights, common to all \n\n \n7 \ncitizens, the constitution of the United States does \nnot, I think, permit any public authority to know the \nrace of those entitled to be protected in the enjoyment \nof such rights.\u201d) (emphasis added).  \nYet \nas \nthis \ncase \ndemonstrates, \nseveral \nappellate courts have read into Title VII a \nrequirement where the pleading standards vary by \nthe race of the litigant. This ignores the fundamental \nprinciple of the Equal Protection Clause\u2014which \nrequires every state actor to treat people as \nindividuals, regardless of their membership in a \ncrudely defined racial group. See Miller v. Johnson, \n515 U.S. 900, 912 (1995) (citation omitted) (\u201cRace-\nbased assignments embody stereotypes that treat \nindividuals as the product of their race.\u201d); SFFA, 600 \nU.S. at 291 (Gorsuch, J., concurring) (\u201cWhere do these \nboxes come from? Bureaucrats. A federal interagency \ncommission devised this scheme of classifications in \nthe 1970s to facilitate data collection.\u201d); Castaneda v. \nPartida, 430 U.S. 482, 504 (1977) (Marshall, J., \nconcurring) (\u201c[T]his Court has a solemn responsibility \nto avoid basing its decisions on broad generalizations \nconcerning minority groups. If history has taught us \nanything, it is the danger of relying on such \nstereotypes.\u201d). \nBut it does not stop with Title VII. Courts also \nconsider the race of a litigant or their counsel as a \nfactor in other contexts. \n\n \n8 \nII. \nUnfortunately, Courts Sometimes Fail to \nLive Up to the Promise of Equality Before \nthe Law. \nThe court of history does not look kindly on \nefforts by courts to discriminate based on race. See, \ne.g., People v. Hall, 4 Cal. 399, 405 (1854) (rejecting \nthe admissibility of Chinese witnesses and smearing \nChinese individuals in offensive terms). But sadly, we \nhave not yet stomped out every instance of differential \ntreatment based on race in the judiciary. Yes, courts\u2014\nwhich should know best the illegality of using race in \ndecision-making\u2014have unfortunately followed the \ntrend of using race as a factor when deciding issues \ninvolving the litigants or the counsel before them. \nA. \nCourts Sometimes Discriminate on \nthe Basis of Race in Appointing \nClass Counsel Under Rule 23. \nIn 2013, the Center for Class Action Fairness \nasked this Court to review a then \u201cunique\u201d and \u201chighly \nunusual practice\u201d of requiring class-counsel to \nconsider race and gender when staffing legal matters. \nSee Martin v. Blessing, 571 U.S. 1040, 1040 (2013) \n(Alito, J., respecting denial of the petition); see also \nPetition for Certiorari, Martin v. Blessing, No. 13-169, \n2 (Docketed August 6, 2013) (\u201cPetitioner Martin seeks \nreview of the district judge\u2019s requiring class counsel to \nstaff the case to reflect the class on the basis of race \nand sex, which the Second Circuit held objectors to \n\n \n9 \nlack standing to challenge.\u201d) (internal citation \nomitted).4 \nThe Court declined to grant a writ of certiorari \nin the case, but Justice Alito commented that he was \n\u201chard-pressed to see any ground on which [the judge\u2019s] \npractice can be defended.\u201d Id. at 1041-42; see id. at \n1041 (\u201cClass certification orders that impose race- and \nsex-based staffing requirements on law firms appear \nto be part of Judge Baer\u2019s standard practice.\u201d).  \nUnfortunately, in the years since Martin, and \ndespite Justice Alito\u2019s warning, this indefensible \npractice has become practically commonplace. In \n2020, for instance, another judge concluded that the \nrace and sex of potential class-counsel\u2019s lawyers \u201cis a \nrelevant factor for the Court,\u201d as \u201c[f]or well over a \ndecade now, the courts have emphasized the \nimportance of diversity in their selection of counsel.\u201d \nSee City of Providence v. AbbVie Inc., 20-cv-5538 \n(LJL), 2020 WL 6049139, *6 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 13, 2020).  \nIn City of Providence, that court cited examples \nfrom district courts across the country where the \njudge had considered various factors relating to race, \nsex, or broad notions of diversity generally. See id. \n(citing In re Robinhood Outage Litig., No. 20-cv-\n01626-JD, 2020 WL 7330596, *2 (N.D. Cal.

Indeed, the body of precedent continues to grow.5 \nSome courts acknowledge Justice Alito\u2019s statement in \nMartin v. Blessing, and yet still consider \u201cdiversity\u201d as \npart of the decision over who to appoint as class \ncounsel. See In re Enzo Biochem Data Sec. Litig., CV \n \n5 See, e.g., In re FICO Antitrust Litig., No. 1:20-CV-02114, 2021 \nWL 4478042, *3 (N.D. Ill. Sept. 30, 2021) (\u201c[C]ourts have \nroutinely recognized, over the past decade, the value of a legal \nteam that is diverse across axes of gender, race, and other \naspects of identity.\u201d); see also Amanda Bronstad, MDL Judge \nTaps \u201cMost Diverse Leadership Team Ever\u201d in Data Breach Class \nAction, Nat. L. J. (Mar. 3, 2021) (covering appointment in In re \nBlackbaud, Inc., Customer Data Breach Litig., 3:20-mn-02972-\nJMC (D.S.C.)), partly based on diversity concerns). \n\n \n11 \n23-4282 (GRB) (AYS), 2023 WL 6385387, at *2 \n(E.D.N.Y. Sept. 29, 2023) (acknowledging Martin but \nstating that \u201cFurthermore, courts may consider \nwhether the proposed counsel is sufficiently diverse to \nreflect the composition of the class.\u201d).6 Note that In re \nEnzo Biochem was issued even after SFFA. \nHow could so many district courts build up this \nnumber of precedents for the proposition that race \n(and sex and \u201cother aspects of identity) matters, when \nit comes to a court\u2019s decision-making? They have told \nus: \nby \nemphasizing \nthe \npreviously \nfavorable \nstatements about diversity in this Court\u2019s past \nopinions. As one court noted, \u201c[a] commitment to \ndiversity is not a commitment to quotas,\u201d City of \nProvidence, 2020 WL 6049139 at *7 (citing Grutter v. \nBollinger, 539 U.S. 306, 334 (2003), for the proposition \nthat there is a compelling interest in promoting \ndiversity, including based on race).  \nIn short, while this Court has course-corrected \nafter Grutter with SFFA, lower courts could still use \nclear and robust guidance on the issue of race. \n \n6 The Hamilton Lincoln Law Institute is to be credited for \ncollecting many of these examples and including them in its \nSFFA Amicus Brief. See Brief of Hamilton Lincoln Law Institute \nas Amicus Curiae, Students for Fair Admissions, Inc. v. Pres. and \nFellows of Harvard College, 20-1199 (Mar. 31, 2021), \nhttps://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/20/20-\n1199/173488/20210331125456187_SFFA%20v%20Harvard%20a\nmicus%20final.pdf.  \n\n \n12 \nB. \nIndividual Judges Have Attempted \nto Use Race in Their Practice \nStandards or Standing Orders. \nThe trend toward considering race in the \ncourtroom is not limited to the class action context. \nFor instance, in 2020, in the Southern District of \nIllinois, three federal judges published Standing \nOrders stating that they would consider the race and \nsex of the attorney before them, in determining \nwhether to grant a motion for oral argument. One \nrepresentative Standing Order stated as follows: \nTo that end, the Court adopts the following \nprocedures regarding oral argument as to \npending motions:  \n1. After a motion is fully briefed, as part of \na Motion Requesting Oral Argument, a \nparty may alert the Court that, if \nargument is granted, it intends to have \na newer, female, or minority attorney \nargue the motion (or a portion of the \nmotion).  \n2. If such a request is made, the Court will:  \nA. Grant the request for oral argument on \nthe motion if it is at all practicable to do \nso.  \nB. Strongly consider allocating additional \ntime for oral argument beyond what the \nCourt may otherwise have allocated \n\n \n13 \nwere a newer, female, or minority \nattorney not arguing the motion.  \nC. Permit other more experienced counsel \nof record the ability to provide some \nassistance to the newer, female, or \nminority attorney who is arguing the \nmotion, where appropriate during oral \nargument. \nSee Standing Orders, In re: Increasing Opportunities \nfor Courtroom Advocacy, (S.D. Ill. Jan. 17, 2020) \n(emphasis added).7  \nSome critics noted that the standing orders \ncould mean that a party\u2019s counsel would receive \nadditional oral argument time, if the attorney were \nnot a white male. See Cross, Oral-argument \nAffirmative Action?, The Federalist Society Blog (Feb. \n13, 2024) (\u201cWith its emphasis on sex and race, the \nIllinois judges\u2019 policy is a different beast. Perhaps the \nmost troubling aspect of the policy is the suggestion, \nwithout explanation, that women\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

After \nbeing required to undergo and personally adopt the \nprinciples of aggressive \u201cEquity, Diversity, and \nInclusion Training,\u201d he resigned his position in the \nLimon Correctional Facility. See Young v. Colorado \nDepartment of Corrections, 94 F.4th 1242, 1244 (10th \nCir. 2024) (\u201cAfter resigning from the Department \nbecause of the training program, Mr. Young sued, \nasserting claims under Title VII and the Equal \nProtection Clause.\u201d). \nWhen Mr. Young brought suit under Title VII \nagainst the Colorado Department of Corrections, that \nagency defended itself from liability by alleging that \nMr. Young had not adequately stated a claim because \nof his race\u2014Caucasian. See Defendants\u2019 Motion to \nDismiss, \nYoung \nv. \nColorado \nDepartment \nof \nCorrections, No. 1:22-cv-00145-NYW-KLM, 2022 WL \n19569770 (2022) (\u201cThis enhancement of the first \nprima facie element reflects courts\u2019 recognition that \nmembers of the majority group are not necessarily \nentitled to a presumption of discrimination.\u201d). \n \n1 Per Supreme Court Rule 37.6, Amicus affirms that no counsel \nfor any party authored this brief in whole or in part, and no \ncounsel or party made a monetary contribution intended to fund \nthe preparation or submission of this brief. No person other than \namici curiae, their members, or their counsel made a monetary \ncontribution to its preparation or submission. \n\n \n2 \nThe District Court, although it granted the \nmotion to dismiss for other reasons, emphasized the \ncontinuing vitality of differential pleading standards \nfor Caucasian plaintiffs in Title VII actions within the \nTenth Circuit Court of Appeals. See Young v. Colorado \nDep\u2019t of Corrections, No. 22-cv-00145-NYW-KLM, \n2023 WL 1437894, at *4 (D. Colo. Feb. 1, 2023) (\u201cIn \nNotari v. Denver Water Department, 971 F.2d 585 \n(1992), the Tenth Circuit first recognized that when a \nplaintiff is tasked with establishing an inference of \ndiscrimination and \u2018is a member of a historically \nfavored group, an inference of invidious intent is \nwarranted only when \u2018background circumstances \nsupport the suspicion that the defendant is that \nunusual employer who discriminates against the \nmajority.\u2019\u201d) (emphasis added).  \nMr. Young finds this differential treatment \nbased on his race\u2014which constitutes open race \ndiscrimination \nby \nthe \njudiciary\u2014fundamentally \nrepugnant to the Constitution\u2019s promise of Equal \nProtection, the text of Title VII, and our country\u2019s \n\n \n3 \nfoundational principles of equality. He therefore \nsubmits this brief in support of Petitioner.2  \nSUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT \nLike the Petitioner, Ms. Ames, Amicus Josh \nYoung suffered discrimination at the hands of his \nemployer based on a protected characteristic. And \nthere is little doubt that the Equal Protection Clause \nof the Fourteenth Amendment, properly construed, \nrequires Courts to treat all parties before them in \ncolorblind manner. Yet, some Courts are treating both \nparties and attorneys differently based solely on a \nperson\u2019s race. It is therefore not enough for this Court \nto issue a modest, corrective opinion, merely stating \nthat lower courts ought to do a better job of applying \nthe text of Title VII, and ensuring that these courts do \nnot add elements to a claim. Indeed, this Court has \nalready done that. See McDonald v. Santa Fe Trail \nTransp. Co., 427 U.S. 273, 280 (1976) (\u201cWe therefore \nhold \ntoday \nthat \nTitle \nVII \nprohibits \nracial \ndiscrimination against the white petitioners in this \ncase upon the same standards as would be applicable \nwere they Negroes and Jackson white.\u201d); Cf. Muldrow \n \n2 To be clear, the Tenth Circuit affirmed the dismissal, without \nprejudice, of Mr. Young\u2019s complaint. See 94 F.4th 1251 (\u201cWhile \nMr. Young asserts that he experienced severe and pervasive \nharassment, \u2026 he does not allege specific facts that demonstrate \nhow the training related to his actual workplace experience.\u201d). \nMr. Young has subsequently filed a new action bolstering his \nallegations of discrimination under Title VII and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 \n1981. See Young v. Colorado Department of Corrections, 23-cv-\n01688-NYW-SBP (D. Colo., Filed June 30, 2023). \n\n \n4 \nv. City of St. Louis, Mo., 601 U.S. 346 (2024). \nSo this is no time for judicial minimalism. \nInstead, this Court should issue a broad and robust \nopinion calling into question every practice where \ncourts treat litigants or their counsel differently based \non race, and reiterate once again the principle that \neveryone is equal before the law.  \nARGUMENT \nJust last year, this Court made a bold \nstatement on behalf of equality under the law in \nStudents for Fair Admissions, Inc. v. Pres. and \nFellows of Harvard College, 600 U.S. 181 (2023) \n(SFFA). In rejecting the University of North \nCarolina\u2019s racial preferences in its student admission \nprocess, the Court criticized UNC\u2019s chief argument in \nfavor of \u201cdiversity\u201d: \u201c[UNC] argues that race in itself \n\u2018says something about who you are.\u2019\u201d Id. at 220 \n(internal \nbrackets \nomitted). \nIn \nholding \nthat \naffirmative action was unconstitutional, and by \nrejecting this argument, the Court made one of its \nclearest statements yet on racial equality: \u201cWe have \ntime and again forcefully rejected the notion that \ngovernment \nactors \nmay \nintentionally \nallocate \npreference to those who may have little in common \nwith one another but the color of their skin.\u201d Id. \n(internal quotation marks omitted). \nThe Court\u2019s statements in SFFA were not \nconfined to schools, or even legislatures. Courts too \nplay a role in upholding these principles. See SFFA, \n600 U.S. at 206 (2023) (\u201cAnd the Equal Protection \nClause, we have accordingly held, applies without \n\n \n5 \nregard to any differences of race, of color, or of \nnationality\u2014it is universal in its application.\u201d) \n(emphasis added). And as the Chief Justice noted \nduring oral argument in SFFA, we did not fight a civil \nwar over oboe players. See Oral Argument Transcript \nof Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard, 20-1199, \n67:22 \u2013 68:3-4 (Oct. 31, 2022) (Mr. Waxman: \u201cRace \u2026 \nfor some highly qualified applicants can be the \ndeterminative factor, just as being \u2026 an oboe player \nin a year in which the Harvard-Radcliffe orchestra \nneeds an oboe player [can be]\u2026 Chief Justice Roberts: \n\u201cYeah. We did not fight a Civil War about oboe \nplayers.\u201d).3  \nRather, this nation embarked on a dramatic \nReconstruction effort after the Civil War in order to \nensure that justice was blind. As this Court recently \narticulated: \nIt must become the heritage of our Nation to \nrise above racial classifications that are so \ninconsistent with our commitment to the \nequal dignity of all persons. This imperative \nto \npurge \nracial \nprejudice \nfrom \nthe \nadministration of justice was given new force \nand direction by the ratification of the Civil \nWar Amendments. \nPena-Rodriguez v. Colorado, 580 U.S. 206, 221 (2017) \n \n3 \nhttps://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_trans\ncripts/2022/20-1199_bi7a.pdf \n\n \n6 \n(emphasis added).  \nHowever, courts across the country are \nengaging in widespread efforts to treat the parties \nbefore them differently, depending on race. These \ninstances, like the underlying issue in this case, \nbetray the ideals of the nation. Amicus Mr. Young \ntherefore asks the Court to issue a broad, sweeping \nruling calling into question judicial efforts to treat the \nparties before them differently based on race. See \nBatson v. Kentucky, 476 U.S. 79, 87-88 (1986) \n(\u201cDiscrimination within the judicial system is most \npernicious\u2026\u201d); see also Edmonson v. Leesville \nConcrete Co., Inc., 500 U.S. 614, 628 (1991) (\u201cRace \ndiscrimination within the courtroom raises serious \nquestions as to the fairness of the proceedings \nconducted there.\u201d). \nI. \nThe Equal Protection Clause Demands a \nColor-Blind Judicial System. \nThe Constitution demands equality before the \nlaw, regardless of the race of the individual. Courts do \nthe nation a disservice when they play a part in \nunequal treatment on account of race. Edmondson, \n500 U.S. at 628 (\u201cFew places are a more real \nexpression of the constitutional authority of the \ngovernment than a courtroom, where the law itself \nunfolds.\u201d); see also SFFA, 600 U.S. at 203 (\u201cThis Court \nplayed its own role in that ignoble history, allowing in \nPlessy v. Ferguson the separate but equal regime that \nwould come to deface much of America.\u201d); Plessy v. \nFerguson, 163 U.S. 537, 554 (1896) (Harlan, J., \ndissenting) (\u201cIn respect of civil rights, common to all \n\n \n7 \ncitizens, the constitution of the United States does \nnot, I think, permit any public authority to know the \nrace of those entitled to be protected in the enjoyment \nof such rights.\u201d) (emphasis added).  \nYet \nas \nthis \ncase \ndemonstrates, \nseveral \nappellate courts have read into Title VII a \nrequirement where the pleading standards vary by \nthe race of the litigant. This ignores the fundamental \nprinciple of the Equal Protection Clause\u2014which \nrequires every state actor to treat people as \nindividuals, regardless of their membership in a \ncrudely defined racial group. See Miller v. Johnson, \n515 U.S. 900, 912 (1995) (citation omitted) (\u201cRace-\nbased assignments embody stereotypes that treat \nindividuals as the product of their race.\u201d); SFFA, 600 \nU.S. at 291 (Gorsuch, J., concurring) (\u201cWhere do these \nboxes come from? Bureaucrats. A federal interagency \ncommission devised this scheme of classifications in \nthe 1970s to facilitate data collection.\u201d); Castaneda v. \nPartida, 430 U.S. 482, 504 (1977) (Marshall, J., \nconcurring) (\u201c[T]his Court has a solemn responsibility \nto avoid basing its decisions on broad generalizations \nconcerning minority groups. If history has taught us \nanything, it is the danger of relying on such \nstereotypes.\u201d). \nBut it does not stop with Title VII. Courts also \nconsider the race of a litigant or their counsel as a \nfactor in other contexts. \n\n \n8 \nII. \nUnfortunately, Courts Sometimes Fail to \nLive Up to the Promise of Equality Before \nthe Law. \nThe court of history does not look kindly on \nefforts by courts to discriminate based on race. See, \ne.g., People v. Hall, 4 Cal. 399, 405 (1854) (rejecting \nthe admissibility of Chinese witnesses and smearing \nChinese individuals in offensive terms). But sadly, we \nhave not yet stomped out every instance of differential \ntreatment based on race in the judiciary. Yes, courts\u2014\nwhich should know best the illegality of using race in \ndecision-making\u2014have unfortunately followed the \ntrend of using race as a factor when deciding issues \ninvolving the litigants or the counsel before them. \nA. \nCourts Sometimes Discriminate on \nthe Basis of Race in Appointing \nClass Counsel Under Rule 23. \nIn 2013, the Center for Class Action Fairness \nasked this Court to review a then \u201cunique\u201d and \u201chighly \nunusual practice\u201d of requiring class-counsel to \nconsider race and gender when staffing legal matters. \nSee Martin v. Blessing, 571 U.S. 1040, 1040 (2013) \n(Alito, J., respecting denial of the petition); see also \nPetition for Certiorari, Martin v. Blessing, No. 13-169, \n2 (Docketed August 6, 2013) (\u201cPetitioner Martin seeks \nreview of the district judge\u2019s requiring class counsel to \nstaff the case to reflect the class on the basis of race \nand sex, which the Second Circuit held objectors to \n\n \n9 \nlack standing to challenge.\u201d) (internal citation \nomitted).4 \nThe Court declined to grant a writ of certiorari \nin the case, but Justice Alito commented that he was \n\u201chard-pressed to see any ground on which [the judge\u2019s] \npractice can be defended.\u201d Id. at 1041-42; see id. at \n1041 (\u201cClass certification orders that impose race- and \nsex-based staffing requirements on law firms appear \nto be part of Judge Baer\u2019s standard practice.\u201d).  \nUnfortunately, in the years since Martin, and \ndespite Justice Alito\u2019s warning, this indefensible \npractice has become practically commonplace. In \n2020, for instance, another judge concluded that the \nrace and sex of potential class-counsel\u2019s lawyers \u201cis a \nrelevant factor for the Court,\u201d as \u201c[f]or well over a \ndecade now, the courts have emphasized the \nimportance of diversity in their selection of counsel.\u201d \nSee City of Providence v. AbbVie Inc., 20-cv-5538 \n(LJL), 2020 WL 6049139, *6 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 13, 2020).  \nIn City of Providence, that court cited examples \nfrom district courts across the country where the \njudge had considered various factors relating to race, \nsex, or broad notions of diversity generally. See id. \n(citing In re Robinhood Outage Litig., No. 20-cv-\n01626-JD, 2020 WL 7330596, *2 (N.D. Cal.

Indeed, the body of precedent continues to grow.5 \nSome courts acknowledge Justice Alito\u2019s statement in \nMartin v.

One \nrepresentative Standing Order stated as follows: \nTo that end, the Court adopts the following \nprocedures regarding oral argument as to \npending motions:  \n1. After a motion is fully briefed, as part of \na Motion Requesting Oral Argument, a \nparty may alert the Court that, if \nargument is granted, it intends to have \na newer, female, or minority attorney \nargue the motion (or a portion of the \nmotion).  \n2. If such a request is made, the Court will:  \nA. Grant the request for oral argument on \nthe motion if it is at all practicable to do \nso.  \nB. Strongly consider allocating additional \ntime for oral argument beyond what the \nCourt may otherwise have allocated \n\n \n13 \nwere a newer, female, or minority \nattorney not arguing the motion.  \nC. Permit other more experienced counsel \nof record the ability to provide some \nassistance to the newer, female, or \nminority attorney who is arguing the \nmotion, where appropriate during oral \nargument. \nSee Standing Orders, In re: Increasing Opportunities \nfor Courtroom Advocacy, (S.D. Ill. Jan. 17, 2020) \n(emphasis added).7  \nSome critics noted that the standing orders \ncould mean that a party\u2019s counsel would receive \nadditional oral argument time, if the attorney were \nnot a white male. See Cross, Oral-argument \nAffirmative Action?, The Federalist Society Blog (Feb. \n13, 2024) (\u201cWith its emphasis on sex and race, the \nIllinois judges\u2019 policy is a different beast. Perhaps the \nmost troubling aspect of the policy is the suggestion, \nwithout explanation, that women and minorities may \nbe entitled to extra time for oral argument simply \nbecause they are women and minorities.\u201d).8 \n \n7 \nhttps://media.aflegal.org/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2024/01/25214339/Merged-\nExhibits.pdf?_ga=2.186220001.959298009.1706738075-\n990187681.1706651260 \n8 \nhttps://fedsoc.org/commentary/fedsoc-blog/oral-argument-\naffirmative-action-nonprofit-s-ethics-complaint-against-three-\nfederal-judges-raises-questions-on-the-judicial-role \n\n \n14 \nA complaint was filed against these Standing \nOrders, and ultimately, the judges withdrew the \nportions of the orders referencing race and sex. See \nU.S. District Court Judges Rescind Discriminatory \nPolicies Following AFL\u2019s Judicial Complaint, Mar. 22, \n2024 (the judges \u201crescinded their standing orders \nfavoring minority and female attorneys solely based \non their race and sex, and apologized\u201d).9 But the \nunderlying question remained: why did 3 federal \njudges think that considerations of race and sex \nmattered? \nSeparately, in the District of Colorado, several \njudges initially proposed giving special consideration \nto \u201cdiverse\u201d members of the bar who requested oral \nargument. See Proposed Uniform Civil Practice \nStandards of the United States Magistrate Judges, at  \n4 (Standard 4), Attorney Mentoring and Training \n(\u201cThe Court welcomes the participation of young, \ninexperienced, and diverse attorneys, in litigation, \nand the parties should advise the Court prior to any \nhearing (including in any request for oral argument) \nif a lawyer of four or fewer years of experience will be \narguing the motion.\u201d) (emphasis added).10  \n \n9 \nhttps://aflegal.org/huge-victory-u-s-district-court-judges-\nrescind-discriminatory-policies-following-afls-judicial-\ncomplaint/ \n10 \nhttps://www.facultyfederaladvocates.org/resources/DRAFT_Prac\ntice%20Standards_2.21.2024.pdf \n\n \n15 \nFortunately, after a period of public comment, \nthis provision did not make it into the final written \npractice standards. Yet litigants could be forgiven for \nwondering whether these judges will apply the same \nstandard informally, without writing it down for the \npublic to see. \nC. \nState Courts Like the Washington \nSupreme Court Have Announced \nThat They Will Treat the Parties \nBefore Them Differently Based on \nRace. \nIn Washington State, the State\u2019s Supreme \nCourt has explicitly adopted race-conscious legal \nstandards when applying the law. In the context of \nwhether a seizure has occurred, for instance, the \nWashington Supreme Court has held that if a \ncriminal defendant is \u201cBIPOC,\u201d that racial status will \nbe a factor in the analysis. See State v. Sum, 511 P.3d \n92, \u00b6 34 (Wash. 2022) (\u201cIn the third and final factor of \nour independent state law analysis, we must consider \nthe current implications of recognizing (or failing to \nrecognize) that race and ethnicity are relevant to the \nseizure analysis.\u201d). \nIn Sum, the question was whether the criminal \ndefendant had been \u201cseized\u201d by law enforcement. The \nState conceded that race was a legitimate factor to \nconsider in the analysis, and the Washington \nSupreme Court agreed and held the same. Because \nthe defendant in the case was Asian, and therefore \ncounted as \u201cBIPOC\u201d\u2014or Black, Indigenous, or a \n\n \n16 \nPerson of Color\u2014a different standard applied. Id. at \u00b6 \n38 (\u201cBased on the constitutional text, recent \ndevelopments in this court\u2019s historical treatment of \nthe rights of BIPOC, and the current implications of \nour decision, we hold as a matter of independent state \nlaw that race and ethnicity are relevant to the \nquestion of whether a person was seized by law \nenforcement.\u201d). \nAs pointed out in the wake of the decision, the \nWashington Supreme Court\u2019s new rule is entirely \ninadministrable: \nSeparately, the court\u2019s decision is simply not \nadministrable. Imagine a court trying to \ndecide whether to apply the new rule. What \nif the criminal suspect is of mixed race? Or \nwhat if the police officer is of mixed race? \nWhat if there are multiple criminal suspects \nof different races? Will some of them be able \nto avoid criminal punishment, while others \ncan be prosecuted under normal procedures? \nThe potential irregularities are numerous. \nTrachman & Kilcullen, Washington State Supreme \nCourt embraces race discrimination, The Washington \nTimes (June 22, 2022).11 Yet as of today, there is no \nevidence that the Washington Supreme Court has \n \n11 \nhttps://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2022/jun/22/washingto\nn-state-supreme-court-embraces-race-discr/ \n\n \n17 \nbacked down even an inch on its commitment to \ndifferential treatment on the basis of race. \nIn a separate Washington case, that State\u2019s \nSupreme Court held that a party to a civil suit who \nwas Caucasian would have a duty to dispel an \nallegation that racial motivations affected the conduct \nof the trial, if the verdict came out in favor of the \nCaucasian party.  \nWhile this Court denied certiorari, given the \ninterlocutory nature of the case, the implications were \nonce again obvious to Justice Alito here. See \nThompson v. Henderson, 143 S. Ct. 2412, 2413 (2023) \n(Mem.) (Alito, J., statement respecting denial of \ncertiorari) (\u201cIn sum, the opinion below, taken at face \nvalue, appears to mean that in any case between a \nwhite party and a black party, the attorney for the \nwhite party must either operate under special, \ncrippling rules or expect to face an evidentiary \nhearing at which racism will be presumed and the \nattorney will bear the burden of somehow proving his \nor her innocence.\u201d). \nJustice Alito appropriately described the \nimpact of the judiciary treating individuals differently \nbased on race: \u201cIt is not an exaggeration to say that \nour extraordinarily diverse population will not be able \nto live and work together harmoniously and \nproductively if we depart from that principle and \nsuccumb to the growing tendency in many quarters to \ndivide Americans up by race or ancestry.\u201d Id. at 2414; \naccord Texas Dept. of Housing and Comm. Affair v. \n\n \n18 \nInclusive Communities Project, Inc., 576 U.S. 519, 555 \n(2015) (Scalia, J., dissenting) (\u201cGovernment action \nthat classifies individuals on the basis of race is \ninherently suspect. That is no less true when judges \nare the ones doing the classifying.\u201d).. \nD. \nRacial \nDiscrimination \nin \nthe \nContext \nof \nPleading \nStandards \nUnder Title VII is Longstanding and \nWidespread.  \nThere is a certain irony in having the relevant \npleading standards differ, based on race, regarding a \nclaim under Title VII. But the irony started over 40 \nyears ago. The D.C. Circuit initiated the \u201cbackground \nrequirements\u201d test for a Caucasian plaintiff in Parker \nv. Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Co., 652 F.2d 1012 (D.C. \nCir. 1981). The Sixth, Seventh, Eighth, and Tenth \nCircuits soon followed. These Courts generally held \nthat because discrimination was statistically less \nlikely to occur against Caucasians or men, a \nheightened pleading standard applied. See, e.g., \nParker, 652 F.2d at 1017 (arguing that \u201cit defies \ncommon sense \u2026 in our present society\u201d to infer \ndiscrimination when a black employee is promoted \nover a white employee).  \nThen, in Harding v. Gray, 9 F.3d 150, 153 (D.C. \nCir. 1993), the D.C. Circuit identified two specific \ncategories of potential background circumstances: (1) \n\u201cevidence indicating that the particular employer at \nissue has some reason or inclination to discriminate \ninvidiously \nagainst\u201d \nmajority \ngroups, \nand \n(2) \n\n \n19 \n\u201cevidence indicating that there is something \u2018fishy\u2019 \nabout the facts of the case at hand that raises an \ninference of discrimination.\u201d  Id.  Finally, although \nHarding required a \u201cmajority-group\u201d plaintiff to \n\u201cshow additional background circumstances\u201d to \n\u201cestablish a prima facie case,\u201d it claimed that \u201c[t]his \nrequirement [was] not designed to disadvantage\u201d such \na plaintiff.  Id. (internal quotation marks omitted). \nOther Circuit Courts have tried to elaborate on \nwhy there would be different pleading standards, \nbased on a plaintiff\u2019s race or sex. In Notari v. Denver \nWater Dep\u2019t, 971 F.2d 585, 589 (10th Cir. 1992), for \ninstance, the Tenth Circuit stated: \u201cThe McDonnell \nDouglas presumption\u2014that is, the presumption that \nunless otherwise explained, discrimination is more \nlikely than not the reason for the challenged \ndecision\u2014is valid for a reverse discrimination \nclaimant only when the requisite background \ncircumstances exist.\u201d  \nNotably, in Notari, the Tenth Circuit cast the \ndoctrine as one related to whether the plaintiff was a \nmember of a historically \u201cfavored\u201d or \u201cdisfavored.\u201d Id. \nat 589 (\u201c[T]he presumptions in Title VII analysis that \nare valid when a plaintiff belongs to a disfavored \ngroup are not necessarily justified when the plaintiff \nis a member of an historically favored group.\u201d) \n(quoting Livingston v. Roadway Express, Inc., 802 \nF.2d 1250, 1252 (10th Cir. 1986). And this \u201chigher\u201d \nburden has real bite; for instance, it led to the \ndismissal of one of the claims in a case because the \nplaintiff\u2019s \nfacts \nfell \n\u201cshort \nof \ndemonstrating \n\n \n20 \n\u2018background circumstances\u2019 sufficient to create an \ninference of reverse discrimination.\u201d Adamson v. \nMulti Community Diversified Svcs., Inc., 514 F.3d \n1136, 1149-50 (10th Cir. 2008). \nInterestingly, some courts have expressed \ndoubts about the doctrine along the way. See, e.g., \nPierce v. Commonwealth Life Ins., 40 F.3d 796, 801 n.7 \n(6th Cir. 1994) (\u201cWe have serious misgivings about the \nsoundness of a test which imposes a more onerous \nstandard for plaintiffs who are white or male than for \ntheir non-white or female counterparts.\u201d); Elson v. \nColorado Mental Health Institute at Pueblo, No. 09\u2013\ncv\u201301375\u2013MSK\u2013CBS, 2011 WL 1103169, *5, n.6 (D. \nColo. Mar. 24, 2011) (\u201cThe Court has some doubt both \nthat Notari's reasoning remains sound nearly two \ndecades after its issuance, \u2026 or that it is uniformly \napplicable in every case in which a white employee \nasserts race discrimination or a male employee claims \nsex discrimination.\u201d). \nUnfortunately, doubts aside, the doctrine \nbefore the Court has metastasized across appellate \ncourts and into numerous Title VII matters, where \ncourts characterize cases as either \u201cdiscrimination\u201d or \n\u201creverse discrimination,\u201d depending on the immutable \ncharacteristics of the plaintiff. Ames v. Ohio Dep\u2019t of \nYouth Services, 87 F.4th 822, 828 (6th Cir. 2023) \n(Kethledge, J., concurring) (\u201cRespectfully, our court \nand others have lost their bearings in adopting this \nrule. If the statute had prescribed this rule expressly, \nwe would subject it to strict scrutiny (at least in cases \n\n \n21 \nwhere plaintiffs are treated less favorably because of \ntheir race).\u201d). \nIII. \nDistrict Courts Understand and Apply \nRelevant Pleading Standards Under Title \nVII. \nAmicus \nMr. \nYoung \nsuffered \nracial \ndiscrimination in his workplace when forced to \nundergo offensive and hateful Equity, Diversity, and \nInclusion (EDI) training, and sought to remedy his \ninjury through Title VII. See Young, 94 F.4th 1242, \n1245 (10th Cir. 2024) (\u201c[T]he racial subject matter and \nideological messaging in the training is troubling on \nmany levels.\u201d). And despite pleading direct evidence \nthat the EDI training itself was racially hostile, his \nformer employer still raised the issue of \u201cbackground \ncircumstances,\u201d and the District Court still went to \nlengths to articulate the vibrancy of that test. Young, \n2023 WL 1437894, at *5 (\u201cThe Court respectfully \ndisagrees with Mr. Young that the Notari line of cases \nhas been \u2018impliedly abrogated\u2019 by Elson or Bostock.\u201d). \nA. \nJosh\u2019s \nExperience \nof \nRacial \nHostility \nJosh Young\u2019s experience illustrates how courts \nmay consider heightened burdens on \u201cmajority-group\u201d \nplaintiffs asserting workplace discrimination claims. \nAs detailed in the District Court\u2019s opinion in his case, \nMr. Young was subjected to mandatory training that \ncontained a glossary defining race as \u201ca social \nconstruct that artificially groups people by skin tone \nand other physical traits,\u201d which \u201cwas created and \n\n \n22 \nused to justify social and economic oppression of \npeople of color by white people.\u201d Young, 2023 WL \n1437894, at *2. The training materials went further, \ncharacterizing any potential objection by white \nemployees \nas \n\u201cwhite \nfragility,\u201d \ndefined \nas \n\u201c[d]iscomfort and defensiveness, often triggered by \nfeelings of fear or guilt, on the part of a white person \nwhen \nconfronted \nby \ninformation \nabout \nracial \ninequality and injustice.\u201d Id. \nThe EDI trainings created what Mr. Young \nalleged was \u201ca culture of suspicion and distrust\u201d \nwithin the Department of Corrections. Id. at *4. A \nprison setting charged with racial undertones is \nalready a challenging place to work, and Josh\u2019s \n\u201cknowledge that his colleagues were being instructed \nin the same manner with the same trainings \nexacerbated the hostile environment.\u201d Id. Despite \nhaving demonstrated \u201csuperior performance\u201d that \nearned him promotions to Housing Sergeant in 2019 \nand Visiting Sergeant in 2020, Mr. Young ultimately \nfelt \u201charassed and intimidated to the point that he no \nlonger felt comfortable working for the [Department].\u201d \nId.; Young, 94 F.4th at 1254 (\u201c[T]he racial rhetoric \ncontained in the Department of Public Health & \nEnvironment\u2019s online training materials echoes the \nracist views espoused by the co-workers and \nsupervisors in Lounds and Tademy.\u201d). \nWhen Mr. Young challenged these materials \nthrough formal channels, the Department refused to \ninvestigate his complaint, claiming it \u201cdid not \nestablish reasonable cause to indicate the presence of \n\n \n23 \ndiscrimination \n[or] \ndiscriminatory \nharassment.\u201d \nYoung, 94 F.4th at 1248. He then brought suit alleging \nboth a hostile work environment claim under Title \nVII, and an equal protection violation. Id. \nThe District Court held that Mr. Young was \npart of a \u201chistorically favored\u201d group, because he was \nCaucasian. And although Mr. Young argued before \nthe District Court that only the text of Title VII was \nrelevant to its statutory interpretation, and that \nrecent cases like Bostock v. Clayton Cnty., Ga., 590 \nU.S. 644 (2020), had emphasized the importance of \ntext, the District Court rejected those arguments, \ncorrectly noting that even the Tenth Circuit had \napplied the \u201cbackground circumstances\u201d test after \nBostock. See Young, 2023 WL 1437894, at *5 \n(\u201cAdditionally, in 2021, a year after the Bostock \ndecision was issued, the Tenth Circuit again \nreiterated that \u201cbecause the plaintiff is male, a prima \nfacie case of discrimination requires stronger proof \nthan when the discrimination targets a female.\u201d) \n(quoting Ibrahim v. All. for Sustainable Energy, LLC, \n994 F.3d 1193, 1201 (10th Cir. 2021)); but see Bostock, \n590 U.S. at 653 (\u201cOnly the written word is the law, \nand all persons are entitled to its benefit.\u201d).  \nOf course, applying an additional pleading \nrequirement onto \u201cmajority-group\u201d plaintiffs\u2019 claims\u2014\none found nowhere in Title VII\u2019s text, and \nfundamentally (and ironically) at odds with the \nstatute\u2019s guarantee of workplace equality\u2014should be \nrejected by this Court. Mr. Young\u2019s case demonstrates \nwhy this Court must decisively reject the \u201cbackground \n\n \n24 \ncircumstances\u201d test. No plaintiff should face elevated \nburdens in challenging workplace discrimination \nsimply because of their race. The Equal Protection \nClause and Title VII demand even-handed application \nof anti-discrimination principles to all. \nIV. \nThe Court Should Issue a Broad and \nSweeping Opinion.  \nThis \nCourt \nhas \nmade \nit \nclear \nthat \ndiscrimination on the basis of race must come to an \nend, because it is noxious to our free Republic. SFFA, \n600 U.S. at 220 (\u201cOne of the principal reasons race is \ntreated as a forbidden classification is that it demeans \nthe dignity and worth of a person to be judged by \nancestry instead of by his or her own merit and \nessential qualities.\u201d) (quoting Rice v. Cayetano, 528 \nU.S. 495, 517 (2000).  \nIt has also made clear that the Court\u2019s \ndoctrines themselves generally apply equally to the \nlitigants before the judiciary. See Flowers v. \nMississippi, 588 U.S. 284, 301 (2019) (\u201c[T]he Court \nhas extended Batson in certain ways. A defendant of \nany race may raise a Batson claim, and a defendant \nmay raise a Batson claim even if the defendant and \nthe excluded juror are of different races.\u201d). \nEliminating the consideration of race of the \nlitigants (or their counsel) from the judicial decision-\nmaking process is part and parcel of that process. \nPena-Rodriguez, 580 U.S. at 222 (\u201cThe duty to \nconfront racial animus in the justice system is not the \nlegislature\u2019s alone.\u201d); id. at 223 (\u201cThe unmistakable \n\n \n25 \nprinciple \nunderlying \nthese \nprecedents \nis \nthat \ndiscrimination on the basis of race, odious in all \naspects, is especially pernicious in the administration \nof justice.\u201d). This case presents an opportunity for the \nCourt to speak broadly about the dangers of using race \nas a factor in decision-making by the judiciary. \nSchuette v. Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action, 572 \nU.S. 291, 324 (2014) (Scalia, J., concurring) (\u201cWhether \ndone by a judge or a school board, such racial \nstereotyping is at odds with equal protection \nmandates.\u201d) (cleaned up). \nCONCLUSION \nIn Muldrow v. City of St. Louis, Missouri, 601 \nU.S. 346 (2024), this Court articulated that Title VII\u2019s \ntext stands on its own, and that courts may not add to \nits requirements through pleading standard. Id. at \n355 (\u201cTo demand \u2018significance\u2019 is to add words\u2014and \nsignificant words, as it were\u2014to the statute Congress \nenacted. It is to impose a new requirement on a Title \nVII claimant, so that the law as applied demands \nsomething more of her than the law as written.\u201d). In \nthis context, it should do the same, by rejecting the \n\u201cbackground circumstances\u201d test. Cf. at 358 (\u201c[W]e \nwill not add words to the law to achieve what some \nemployers might think a desirable result.\u201d). \nBut the Court can and should go further in this \ncase. This matter is the perfect vehicle to issue a broad \nand sweeping order that race cannot be considered by \ncourts as a factor in decision-making in any way, such \nthat litigants or their lawyers may be treated \n\n \n26 \ndifferently based on race. \u201cEliminating racial \ndiscrimination means eliminating all of it.\u201d SFFA, 600 \nU.S. at 206; Edmondson, 500 U.S. at 628 (\u201cRacial bias \nmars the integrity of the judicial system and prevents \nthe idea of democratic government from becoming a \nreality.\u201d). \nThe Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth \nAmendment demands such a broad and sweeping \norder. As the Chief Justice previously noted, \u201cThe way \nto stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop \ndiscriminating on the basis of race.\u201d Parents Involved \nin Community Schools v. Seattle School Dist. No. 1, \n551 U.S. 701, 748 (2007) (plurality opinion).

          "task_beliefs": "My model of this case is solidifying around the formidable procedural and vehicle-related obstacles raised by the respondent. While my overall prediction for a cert grant remains at a **low-to-medium probability**, my understanding of the specific arguments that make a denial likely has become significantly more detailed and concrete.\n\nThe core of my belief structure, which I am now in the process of deeply analyzing, is the respondent's three-pronged argument against certiorari, as laid out in their Brief in Opposition (BIO):\n1.  **Waiver/Preservation Failure:** The respondent argues that the petitioner, Marlean Ames, never properly challenged the validity of the \"background circumstances\" test itself in the lower courts. Instead, she argued that she *met* the test. This frames the Question Presented as a new argument not properly preserved for Supreme Court review, which is a powerful reason for the Court to deny the petition.\n2.  **Lack of Outcome-Determinacy (The \"Advisory Opinion\" Problem):** This is a two-part argument. First, for the demotion claim, the Sixth Circuit's decision rested on a separate, unchallenged finding that Ames failed to show the Department's reasons were pretextual. Therefore, even if the Supreme Court eliminated the \"background circumstances\" requirement, she would still lose on pretext grounds. Second, for the failure-to-promote claim, the respondent argues it fails for other reasons, including the decision-maker's ignorance of the selected candidate's sexual orientation. Combined, these arguments contend that a ruling on the Question Presented would not change the ultimate outcome for Ames, rendering any opinion by the Court advisory.\n3.  **Superficial Circuit Split:** The respondent seeks to minimize the split by characterizing it as a non-substantive disagreement over \"language not law.\" They argue that all circuits, regardless of the specific test they articulate, are engaged in the same fundamental inquiry: determining whether the facts support an inference of discrimination.\n\nThe successful resolution of the procedural timeline\u2014confirming the petitioner's reply brief is due by **June 14, 2024**\u2014has eliminated the last major *procedural* uncertainty. My focus is now entirely *substantive*. The BIO's arguments have established a clear and high bar. My predictive model is now a direct function of the petitioner's ability to convincingly rebut these three specific points in their forthcoming reply. The case's fate hinges on whether that reply can successfully re-frame the case as a clean, necessary, and outcome-determinative vehicle for resolving a genuine circuit split.",
          "design_beliefs": "This observation, reflecting my own internal reasoning and planning, marks a significant step in the maturation of my strategic framework. It validates the move from reactive information gathering to proactive, structured analysis and planning.\n\n**Foundational Heuristics (Stable and Validated):**\n1.  **Prioritize Key Sections of the Cert Petition:** Focus on the Question Presented, basis for jurisdiction, and argument for the writ.\n2.  **Actively Seek Signals from Lower Court Opinions:** Concurrences/dissents are strong indicators of jurisprudential tension.\n3.  **Assess the \"Vehicle\" Quality:** A clean legal question and factual record are paramount.\n4.  **Map Arguments to Judicial Philosophy:** Understand how arguments appeal to different interpretive methods.\n\n**Advanced Strategic Heuristics (Proven Effective):**\n5.  **Principle of Targeted Uncertainty Reduction:** Actively identify the largest knowledge gap and seek the specific information source that resolves it.\n6.  **Leverage Case Lifecycle Knowledge:** Understand the sequence of filings (Petition -> BIO -> Reply) and their governing rules to anticipate information flow and pace actions accordingly (i.e., \"active waiting\").\n7.  **Embrace Argumentative Duality:** Model the case as a dialectic between competing narratives to guard against confirmation bias.\n\n**Cert-Stage Tactical Heuristics (Learned and Refined):**\n8.  **Vehicle Purity is a Primary Battleground:** Procedural cleanliness is often more critical at the cert stage than the question's national importance.\n9.  **Scrutinize for Procedural Bars, Especially Preservation:** A waiver argument is a common and effective \"off-ramp\" for the Court.\n10. **Deconstruct the Circuit Split Narrative:** Analyze how each side frames the disagreement (e.g., \"entrenched split\" vs. \"language not law\").\n11. **Apply the \"Outcome-Determinacy Test\":** Ask: \"If the petitioner wins on the Question Presented, would they still lose on other, unchallenged grounds?\"\n12. **Scan for Amicus Briefs (New):** After the BIO is filed, check for amicus briefs. Their presence, absence, and authorship are valuable signals regarding the case's perceived importance and the breadth of its potential impact beyond the immediate parties.\n\n**Meta-Heuristics (Learned from Reflection):**\n13. **Synthesize and Plan (New):** After acquiring a significant piece of information (like a BIO), but before taking the next action, explicitly pause to synthesize all knowledge and formulate a clear, multi-step plan. This `THINK` step maximizes efficiency and ensures actions are purposeful.\n14. **Verify Filing Deadlines:** Before searching for an anticipated, time-sensitive document, first consult the docket to determine its filing deadline.\n15. **The Procedural Prerequisite Chain:** When seeking a future document, first identify the procedural rule governing its timing. Then, trace the chain of prerequisite events backward and find the most recent concrete fact (e.g., a filing date) that allows for a forward calculation of the deadline.\n\nThe internal reasoning captured in this observation is a direct application of Heuristic #13. By pausing to plan, I have confirmed that my next steps should be a deep analysis of the BIO, followed by a search for amicus briefs, and then a period of \"active waiting\" for the June 14 reply brief deadline. This demonstrates a shift from merely knowing the rules to strategically navigating the case timeline, allocating analytical resources effectively, and identifying secondary information sources (amicus briefs) that can further refine my predictive model."

          "task_beliefs": "My understanding of this case has been significantly reshaped by the discovery of an amicus curiae brief filed in support of the petitioner. While my previous analysis focused heavily on the formidable procedural obstacles raised by the respondent, this new information introduces a powerful counter-narrative that elevates the case's importance and increases the likelihood of a cert grant.\n\nMy predictive model, previously weighted heavily by the respondent's three key arguments (waiver, lack of outcome-determinacy, and superficial circuit split), must now incorporate a significant new factor: ideological signaling.\n\n1.  **Amicus Brief as a Signal of Importance:** The search has uncovered a \"Brief of Amicus Curiae Josh Young in Support of Petitioner,\" filed by the Mountain States Legal Foundation (MSLF). The involvement of a prominent conservative/libertarian public interest law firm is a major development. It signals to the Court that this case is not merely a fact-bound employment dispute but is viewed by influential legal advocates as a vehicle for advancing a specific, broad legal principle.\n\n2.  **The Nature of the Amicus:** The chosen amicus, Josh Young, is highly effective. His personal experience as a Caucasian plaintiff in a Title VII case who also faced the \"background circumstances\" requirement in the Tenth Circuit makes the issue concrete and relatable. He is not an abstract entity but a parallel victim of the same legal doctrine at issue.\n\n3.  **The Amicus's Argumentative Strategy:** The MSLF brief strategically reframes the Question Presented. It argues that the \"background circumstances\" test is not an isolated, technical pleading standard but a symptom of a \"widespread\" and \"pernicious\" trend of unconstitutional race-based decision-making *within the judiciary itself*. By explicitly invoking the Court's landmark decision in *Students for Fair Admissions (SFFA) v. Harvard* and calling for a \"broad and sweeping opinion,\" the brief attempts to elevate the case from the procedural weeds to a matter of fundamental constitutional principle. It directly appeals to the judicial philosophies of the Court's conservative wing.\n\n4.  **Impact on Cert Probability:** The presence of this amicus brief provides a substantial counterweight to the respondent's strong procedural arguments. While the waiver and outcome-determinacy issues remain serious obstacles, this brief gives the Justices a reason to overlook them. It frames the case as a necessary opportunity to reinforce the \"color-blind\" constitutionalism of *SFFA* and apply it to the judicial branch itself. Consequently, my assessment of the cert grant probability has shifted from **low-to-medium** to a more solid **medium**. The case is no longer just about its technical merits as a \"vehicle\" but about its potential as an ideological statement.\n\nMy model of the case's fate no longer rests solely on the petitioner's ability to rebut the BIO's procedural points in the forthcoming reply brief. It now also depends on whether at least four Justices view this case as a sufficiently attractive vehicle for the ideological project championed by the amicus, even with its procedural flaws. The petitioner's reply brief, due June 14, 2024, is now even more critical, as it must not only address the procedural arguments but also align with and capitalize on this powerful ideological framing.",
          "design_beliefs": "This observation provides powerful validation for several existing heuristics and prompts the development of more nuanced strategic principles. My framework for analyzing cert-stage dynamics has become more robust.\n\n**Foundational & Advanced Heuristics (Stable and Validated):**\nThe core principles of prioritizing key petition sections (#1), analyzing lower court opinions (#2), assessing vehicle quality (#3), mapping arguments to judicial philosophy (#4), targeted uncertainty reduction (#5), leveraging case lifecycle knowledge (#6), and embracing argumentative duality (#7) remain the unshaken foundation of my process.\n\n**Cert-Stage Tactical Heuristics (Validated and Refined):**\n8.  **Vehicle Purity is a Primary Battleground:** This remains true, but the observation shows that a strong ideological push can challenge this principle's dominance.\n9.  **Scrutinize for Procedural Bars, Especially Preservation:** This heuristic, which led me to focus on the BIO's arguments, remains critical.\n10. **Deconstruct the Circuit Split Narrative:** The amicus brief is a perfect example of a counter-narrative, reframing the split from \"language not law\" to a symptom of a deep, unconstitutional problem. This confirms the value of analyzing the *framing* of the split.\n11. **Apply the \"Outcome-Determinacy Test\":** This remains a key reason for cert denial, but the observation shows it can be downplayed if the question's importance is successfully magnified.\n12. **Scan for Amicus Briefs:** This heuristic has been **powerfully validated**. The action it prompted yielded the single most important signal since the BIO, fundamentally changing my model of the case.\n\n**Meta-Heuristics (Validated):**\n13. **Synthesize and Plan:** My decision to pause and plan after reading the BIO directly led to the search that uncovered this brief.\n14. **Verify Filing Deadlines:** This remains a crucial first step.\n15. **The Procedural Prerequisite Chain:** This remains essential for timeline management.\n\n**New & Refined Design Beliefs (Learned from this Observation):**\n16. **Analyze Amicus Identity and Ideology (New):** It is not merely the *existence* of an amicus brief that matters, but *who* is filing it. A brief from a well-known ideological advocate like MSLF carries a much stronger signal about a case's potential for a broad ruling than one from a party with a narrow commercial interest. The identity of the amicus provides crucial information about the nature and strength of the signal.\n17. **Frame the Case as a Battle of Narratives (New):** A more sophisticated model of a case at the cert stage is not just a petitioner-vs-respondent dialectic, but a clash of overarching narratives. In this instance, it is the \"Respondent's Procedural Off-Ramp Narrative\" versus the \"Petitioner/Amicus's Ideological Imperative Narrative.\" The cert decision often comes down to which narrative is more compelling to at least four Justices.\n18. **Quarantine and Extract from Anomalous Data (New):** The amicus brief contained confusing data: a future date (Dec. 16, 2024) and language (\"On Writ of Certiorari\") suggesting a merits stage posture that contradicts my known facts. The correct response was not to discard the observation but to hypothesize a cause for the anomaly (e.g., a prospective merits brief draft) and to separate the reliable signal (the filer's identity, the content of the argument) from the unreliable noise (the implied procedural posture). This is a critical skill for navigating imperfect information environments."

This latest observation\u2014a failed search for the Petition for a Writ of Certiorari\u2014provides no new substantive information about the case's merits or legal arguments. Therefore, my core predictive model is stable.\n\n-   **Current Model (Stable):** The case's fate at the cert stage hinges on which narrative proves more compelling to the Justices:\n    1.  **The Respondent's \"Procedural Off-Ramp\" Narrative:** This case is a poor vehicle due to waiver, lack of outcome-determinacy, and a superficial circuit split. The Court should deny cert to avoid these complications.\n    2.  **The Petitioner/Amicus \"Ideological Imperative\" Narrative:** This case is a crucial opportunity to extend the color-blind constitutionalism of *SFFA v. Harvard* to the judiciary itself by striking down the \"background circumstances\" test, a judicially created form of discrimination. The procedural flaws are secondary to this fundamental issue.\n-   **Cert Probability (Stable):** My assessment remains at a solid **medium**. The MSLF amicus brief provides a significant reason for the conservative wing of the Court to grant cert, counterbalancing the otherwise formidable procedural hurdles.\n-   **Identified Information Gap (New and Critical):** This observation's primary impact on my task-level beliefs is to highlight a critical gap in my knowledge base. I have analyzed the respondent's arguments (in the BIO) and a supporting amicus brief, but I have not yet read the petitioner's own words in the foundational document of the case: the Petition for a Writ of Certiorari. My understanding of the petitioner's strategy is currently inferred through the respondent's rebuttal and the amicus's support, which is a significant vulnerability.\n-   **Uncertainty and Next Steps:** I must acquire and analyze the petition. This is now my highest priority. It will allow me to answer crucial questions:\n    -   How does the petitioner frame the Question Presented and the circuit split?\n    -   Does the petitioner's argument lay the groundwork for the broad, ideological appeal made by the MSLF, or did the amicus introduce that frame independently? The degree of synergy between the petition and the amicus brief is a key variable.\n    -   How does the petitioner preemptively address the procedural arguments (waiver, etc.) that the respondent later raised in the BIO?\n\nIn essence, while my top-level prediction is unchanged, my confidence in the *granularity* of my model is weakened by the confirmed absence of the petition from my data set. My analysis of the amicus brief's impact is provisional until I can verify that it aligns with and supports the petitioner's core strategy.",
          "design_beliefs": "This observation, a null search result for a known-to-exist document, is highly informative at the design level. It provides no new facts about the case but offers a crucial lesson in the methodology of information acquisition and analysis. My strategic framework has been tested and refined by this failure.\n\n**Foundational & Tactical Heuristics (Stable and Reinforced):**\nMy existing heuristics (#1-15) remain valid. The failure to retrieve the petition does not invalidate the principles of prioritizing key documents, scrutinizing procedural bars, or analyzing amicus briefs. In fact, it reinforces their importance by highlighting the consequences of having an incomplete document set.\n\n**Meta-Heuristics (Refined):**\n-   **18. Quarantine and Extract from Anomalous Data:** This heuristic is now expanded. An unexpected null result from a search is itself an anomaly. The correct response is not to conclude the information doesn't exist, but to diagnose the failure of the information-gathering process. I must treat the search failure as a signal about my tool or query, not necessarily about the external world.\n\n**New & Refined Design Beliefs (Learned from this Observation):**\n-   **19. The Principle of Foundational Document Precedence (New):** A robust analysis must be built layer by layer. The foundational documents\u2014the Petition for Certiorari and the Brief in Opposition\u2014must be acquired and analyzed *before* giving significant weight to secondary documents like amicus briefs or reply briefs. Analyzing supporting arguments without first understanding the core claims they support creates a risk of misinterpretation, as one might incorrectly attribute the amicus's framing to the petitioner.\n-   **20. The Heuristic of Retrieval Resilience (New):** Information retrieval is not a frictionless process. When a targeted search for a critical, known-to-exist document fails, I must not abandon the search. Instead, I must initiate a diagnostic subroutine:\n    -   Vary search parameters (e.g., use broader terms, different field filters).\n    -   Question the tool's limitations or indexing scheme.\n    -   Hypothesize alternative naming conventions or document categorizations within the database.\n    This transforms a simple failure into a problem-solving opportunity and builds resilience against imperfect tools and messy data environments.\n-   **1. Prioritize Key Petition Sections (Refined):** This heuristic is fundamentally sound, but this observation adds a crucial antecedent step: **\"First, robustly acquire the document.\"** The prioritization of sections is meaningless without the document itself. My strategic planning must now explicitly differentiate between the *identification* of a necessary document and the *method of its acquisition*, with contingency plans for the latter."

Forklift Sys., Inc., 510 U.S. 17, 22 \n(1993).  It does so in clear and plain terms, making it \n\u201cunlawful\u201d for any \u201cemployer to fail or refuse to hire or to \ndischarge any individual, or otherwise to discriminate \nagainst any individual . . . because of such individual\u2019s \nrace, color, religion, sex, or national origin.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 2000e-2.  That mandate, as this Court has explained, \nserves the \u201ccentral statutory purpose[] of eradicating  \ndiscrimination throughout the economy.\u201d  Albemarle \nPaper Co. v. Moody, 422 U.S. 405, 421 (1975).  \nYet in several circuits for several decades, courts have \nmade it harder to eradicate discrimination by imposing a \n\u201cbackground circumstances\u201d requirement on majority-\ngroup plaintiffs, and only those plaintiffs.  P.A. 5a.  Under \nthat requirement, a plaintiff who is a member of the \nmajority group must, in addition to Title VII\u2019s other \nelements, show \u201cbackground circumstances to support \nthe suspicion that the defendant is that unusual employer \nwho discriminates against the majority.\u201d  Id.  That \nadditional, heightened burden proved dispositive for \nMarlean Ames.  As the Sixth Circuit acknowledged, \nwithout a \u201cbackground circumstances\u201d requirement, \n\u201cAmes\u2019s prima-facie case was easy to make.\u201d  Id.  And \nbecause \u201cAmes\u2019s evidence of pretext is notably stronger \nfor [her sexual orientation discrimination] claim than for \nher\u201d other claims, Judge Kethledge stressed that Ames \nwas \u201cden[ied] . . . a jury trial\u201d \u201c[b]ased [on] our application \nof the \u2018background circumstances\u2019 rule alone.\u201d  P.A. 10a \n(Kethledge, J., concurring).  \nAmes is a heterosexual woman.  P.A. 5a.  She joined \nthe Ohio Department of Youth Services in 2004, starting \n\n2 \n \n \nout as an Executive Secretary before earning several \npromotions and becoming the Program Administrator for \nthe Prison Rape Elimination Act (\u201cPREA\u201d) in 2014.  P.A. \n16a\u201317a.  Ames\u2019s 2018 review noted that she \u201cha[d] met \nall of her goals and performance expectations,\u201d that she \nwas doing \u201ca good job in her role as PREA \nAdministrator,\u201d and that it was \u201ca pleasure having \nMarlean on [the] team.\u201d  J.A. 235.  Her prior reviews had \nbeen similar; from 2016 to 2018, Ames met or exceeded \nexpectations \nacross \nevery \ndimension \nin \nevery \nperformance review.  J.A. 215\u201337. \nIn 2019, Ames applied and interviewed for a promotion \nto Bureau Chief, but did not get the job.  P.A. 4a.  Instead, \nthe position remained vacant for eight months, before the \nDepartment offered it to a gay woman who (1) started \nafter Ames, (2) did not interview or apply for the job, and \n(3) was \u201carguably less qualified,\u201d thereby requiring the \nDepartment to \u201ccircumvent its own internal procedures\u201d \nto hire her.  P.A. 20a\u201321a; J.A. 152; P.A. 10a (Kethledge, \nJ., concurring) (cleaned up).   \nShortly after Ames was denied the promotion, the \nDepartment also removed her from the Program \nAdministrator role, giving her the choice between a \ndemotion back to Executive Secretary\u2014a position she \nheld a decade ago\u2014or termination.  P.A. 4a; P.A. 16a.  She \nchose the former.   \nIn her place, the Department hired a gay man who, \nmuch like the gay woman hired for the Bureau Chief \nposition, was \u201cneither qualified\u201d nor had \u201cformally \napplied\u201d for the role.  P.A. 44a.  Moreover, this man had \ntold many coworkers that he \u201cwanted Ms. Ames\u2019s job,\u201d \nincluding his first supervisor, his second supervisor, Ames \nherself, and Ames\u2019s supervisor.  J.A. 82\u201383; J.A. 132; J.A. \n147; J.A. 174\u201375.  Additionally, in conversations with \n\n3 \n \n \nAmes, he \u201cclaim[ed] that he could manipulate people to \nget what he wanted on the basis of being a gay man.\u201d  P.A. \n23a.   \nSuch facts, the Sixth Circuit observed, would satisfy \nthe usual prerequisites for establishing a prima facie case \nof discrimination:  Ames\u2019s \u201cclaim is based on sexual \norientation, which is a protected ground under Title VII; \nshe was demoted from her position as PREA \nAdministrator and had held that position for five years, \nwith reasonably good reviews; and she was replaced by a \ngay man.  Moreover, for the Bureau Chief position that \nAmes was denied, the Department chose a gay woman.\u201d  \nP.A. 5a. (citing Bostock v. Clayton County, 590 U.S. 644, \n649\u201353 (2020)).  But because \u201cAmes is heterosexual,\u201d she \n\u201cmust make a showing in addition to the usual ones for \nestablishing a prima-facie case\u201d\u2014i.e., she must prove \n\u201cbackground circumstances.\u201d  Id.  Majority-group \nplaintiffs \u201cmake that showing,\u201d the court continued, \u201cwith \nevidence that a member of the relevant minority group \n(here, gay people) made the employment decision at issue, \nor with statistical evidence showing a pattern of \ndiscrimination by the employer against members of the \nmajority group.\u201d  P.A. at 5a\u20136a.  Because Ames had done \nneither, her claim could not get past the first part of the \nfirst step of the McDonnell Douglas v. Green framework.   \nPut differently, if Ames were gay and the employees \nhired in preference of her were not, she would have \nestablished the elements necessary for her prima-facie \ncase.  P.A. 5a.  But because Ames falls on the majority-\ngroup side of the majority/minority fault line, she has no \nlegal recourse.   \nThat jarring result cannot be consistent with Title VII.  \nIt contravenes the text because the \u201cstatute\u2019s focus on the \nindividual is unambiguous.\u201d  Connecticut v. Teal, 457 U.S. \n\n4 \n \n \n440, 455 (1982).  The Sixth Circuit\u2019s reading, in contrast, \nexplicitly \u201ctreats some \u2018individuals\u2019 worse than others\u2014in \nother words, it discriminates\u2014on the very grounds that \nthe statute forbids.\u201d  P.A. 10a (Kethledge, J., concurring).   \nThe result also conflicts with this Court\u2019s instruction \nthat, under Title VII, \u201c[d]iscriminatory preference for any \ngroup, minority or majority, is precisely and only what \nCongress has proscribed.\u201d  Griggs v. Duke Power Co., 401 \nU.S. 424, 431 (1971).  Thus, when deciding such cases, \ncourts must apply \u201cthe same standards\u201d to all plaintiffs \nalike.  McDonald v. Santa Fe Trail Transp. Co., 427 U.S. \n273, 280 (1976).  The federal government, for its part, has \nexplicitly disclaimed the \u201cbackground circumstances\u201d \nrequirement for decades.  See U.S. Equal Emp. \nOpportunity Comm\u2019n, EEOC-CVG-2006-1, Section 15 \nRace and Color Discrimination, at 15-II & n.23 (2006) \n(\u201cSome courts . . . take the position that\u201d a majority-group \nplaintiff \u201cmust meet a heightened standard of proof.  The \nCommission, in contrast, applies the same standard of \nproof.\u201d); accord EEOC-NVTA-0000-17, Facts About \nRace/Color Discrimination (1997) (same).   \nIn short, in enacting Title VII, Congress sought the \n\u201cremoval of artificial, arbitrary, and unnecessary barriers \nto employment when the barriers operate invidiously to \ndiscriminate on the basis of racial or other impermissible \nclassification.\u201d  Griggs, 401 U.S. at 431.  The \u201cbackground \ncircumstances\u201d requirement, as the Sixth Circuit all but \nacknowledges, is one of those barriers.  This Court should \nremove it.   \n \n\n5 \n \n \nOPINIONS BELOW \nThe opinion of the Sixth Circuit is published at 87 \nF.4th 822 (6th Cir. 2023) and is reproduced in the petition \nappendix at P.A. 2a\u201311a.  The district court\u2019s order on \nRespondent\u2019s \nmotion \nfor \nsummary \njudgment \nis \nunpublished and is reproduced at P.A. 13a\u201340a.

On February 22, 2024, the Court granted an \nextension of time to file a petition for a writ of certiorari.  \nThe petition for a writ of certiorari was filed on March 18, \n2024, and granted on October 4, 2024.  This Court has \njurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254(1).   \n \nSTATUTORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(a)(1) provides:   \n \nIt shall be an unlawful employment practice \nfor an employer to fail or refuse to hire or to \ndischarge any individual, or otherwise to \ndiscriminate against any individual with \nrespect \nto \nhis \ncompensation, \nterms, \nconditions, or privileges of employment, \nbecause of such individual\u2019s race, color, \nreligion, sex, or national origin. \n  \n\n6 \n \n \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nA. Legal framework. \n1.  A Title VII plaintiff \u201cmay prove his case by direct \nor circumstantial evidence.\u201d  U.S. Postal Serv. Bd. of \nGovernors v. Aikens, 460 U.S. 711, 714 n.3 (1983).  \nBecause \u201c[t]here will seldom be \u2018eyewitness\u2019 testimony as \nto the employer\u2019s mental processes,\u201d id. at 716, this Court \narticulated in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 \nU.S. 792 (1973), a \u201ctool for assessing claims, typically at \nsummary judgment, when the plaintiff relies on indirect \nproof of discrimination,\u201d Comcast Corp. v. Nat\u2019l Ass\u2019n of \nAfr. Am. Owned Media, 589 U.S. 327, 340 (2020).   \nFor that framework, a plaintiff must \u201ccarry the initial \nburden under the statute of establishing a prima facie \ncase\u201d of discrimination.  McDonnell Douglas, 411 U.S. at \n802.  \u201cThe burden of making this showing is \u2018not onerous.\u2019\u201d  \nYoung v. United Parcel Serv., Inc., 575 U.S. 206, 228 \n(2015) (quoting Tex. Dep\u2019t of Cmty. Affs. v. Burdine, 450 \nU.S. 248, 253 (1981)).  In McDonnell Douglas itself, for \ninstance, the plaintiff established a prima facie case \u201cby \nshowing (i) that he belong[ed] to a racial minority; (ii) that \nhe applied and was qualified for a job for which the \nemployer was seeking applicants; (iii) that, despite his \nqualifications, he was rejected; and (iv) that, after his \nrejection, the position remained open and the employer \ncontinued \nto \nseek \napplicants \nfrom \npersons \nof \ncomplainant\u2019s qualifications.\u201d  411 U.S. at 802.   \nOnce the prima facie case is established, the burden \n\u201cshift[s] to the employer to articulate some legitimate, \nnondiscriminatory reason for the employee\u2019s rejection.\u201d  \nId.  Finally, the burden returns to the plaintiff to show \n\n7 \n \n \nthat the employer\u2019s \u201cstated reason\u201d for its employment \naction \u201cwas in fact pretext.\u201d  Id. at 804.   \n2.  The \u201cbackground circumstances\u201d rule, first applied \nby the D.C. Circuit in Parker v. Baltimore & Ohio \nRailroad, adds to the traditional McDonnell Douglas \nframework.  652 F.2d 1012 (D.C. Cir. 1981).   \nIn Parker, a white man \u201cclaim[ed] that his efforts to \nbecome a locomotive fireman were defeated by illegal \npreferences given to black and female applicants.\u201d  Id. at \n1014.  In evaluating Parker\u2019s claim, the D.C. Circuit \nopined that \u201c[m]embership in a socially disfavored group \nwas the assumption on which the entire McDonnell \nDouglas analysis was predicated, for only in that context \ncan\u201d there be an \u201cinfer[ence] [of] discriminatory motive \nfrom the unexplained hiring of an outsider rather than a \ngroup member.\u201d  Id. at 1017.  Thus, although \u201c[w]hites are \nalso a protected group under Title VII,\u201d the D.C. Circuit \nbelieved that \u201cit defie[d] common sense to suggest that \nthe promotion of a black employee justifies an inference \nof prejudice against white co-workers in our present \nsociety.\u201d  Id.  Consequently, \u201cto prove a prima facie case \nof intentionally disparate treatment,\u201d the D.C. Circuit \nheld that a majority-group plaintiff must point to \n\u201cbackground circumstances [which] support the suspicion \nthat the defendant is that unusual employer who \ndiscriminates against the majority.\u201d  Id.  \n3.  Four other courts of appeals, including the Sixth \nCircuit, \nhave \nsince \nadopted \na \n\u201cbackground \ncircumstances\u201d requirement, generally citing either \nParker or a subsequent case applying Parker.  See, e.g., \nMurray v. Thistledown Racing Club, Inc., 770 F.2d 63, 67 \n(6th Cir. 1985); Mills v. Health Care Serv. Corp., 171 F.3d \n450, 455\u201357 (7th Cir. 1999); Hammer v. Ashcroft, 383 F.3d \n\n8 \n \n \n722, 724 (8th Cir. 2004); Notari v. Denver Water Dep\u2019t, 971 \nF.2d 585, 588\u201389 (10th Cir. 1992).   \nB. Factual background.1 \n1.  The Ohio Department of Youth Services (\u201cthe \nDepartment\u201d) is \u201ca state agency that oversees juvenile \ncorrections, parole, and the rehabilitation of youth \nthrough community programs.\u201d  P.A. 14a.  Marlean Ames \nwas hired as an Executive Secretary for the Department \nin 2004.  P.A. 16a.  She was promoted in 2009 to \nCommunity Facility Liaison.  Id.  In that role, Ames was \nsupervised for several years by then-Deputy Director \nRyan Gies, who \u201csigned off on strong reviews of her \nperformance each year between 2011 [and] 2013.\u201d  P.A. \n22a.  These reviews described Ames as \u201can invaluable \nasset\u201d and underscored her \u201ccontribution to the positive \nculture in the Division.\u201d  J.A. 207; J.A. 213. \nIn 2014, the Department promoted Ames again, this \ntime to PREA Administrator.  P.A. 3a.  In that role, Ames \nreported to Wendi Faulkner.  J.A. 97.  On Ames\u2019s 2016 \nyear-end review, Faulkner rated Ames overall as \nexceeding expectations.  J.A. 215\u201318.  Faulkner observed \nthat Ames had done \u201ca stellar job of representing not only \nthe division, but the agency,\u201d that Ames had \u201cbecome a \nfederally-certified PREA Auditor to further her \nknowledge,\u201d and that Ames was \u201ctruly . . . a value-added \nmember of the team.\u201d  J.A. 216\u201318. \nIn 2017, Ames began reporting to Ginine Trim, a gay \nwoman.  P.A. 3a.  In her 2017 year-end review, Faulkner \n \n1 Because this matter arises in a summary judgment posture, the \nfacts are viewed in the light most favorable to Ames, with reasonable \ninferences drawn in her favor.  Tolan v. Cotton, 572 U.S. 650, 651 \n(2014) (citing Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 255 \n(1986)).   \n\n9 \n \n \nand Trim again rated Ames as meeting or exceeding \nexpectations in all competencies.  J.A. 220\u201326.  It noted \nthat she \u201cdoes well working with groups,\u201d was a \u201cteam \nplayer,\u201d and \u201cwork[ed] well with others.\u201d  J.A. 223; J.A. \n226.  \u201cOverall,\u201d the review concluded that \u201cMarlean is \ndoing a good job in her role,\u201d expressed \u201cthank[s]\u201d for her \n\u201chard work and commitment,\u201d and stated that it was \u201ca \npleasure having [Ames] on [the] team.\u201d  J.A. 226.   \nHer 2018 review was substantially similar.  Trim rated \nAmes as meeting or exceeding expectations in all \ncompetencies and commended her for being \u201c[v]ery \ncompetent in her role as PREA administrator.\u201d  J.A. 229\u2013\n35.  The evaluation added that Ames is \u201calways willing to \nassist others\u201d and \u201cdoes well coordinating and working \nwith her peers.\u201d  J.A. 230; J.A. 232.  The review observed \nthat Ames could \u201cassume a more active role in managing\u201d \nPREA grant funds, but nevertheless rated Ames as \nmeeting expectations on this metric.  J.A. 234.  Ultimately, \nTrim noted that she looked forward to watching Ames \ncontinue to grow in her role, stated that it was a \u201cpleasure \nhaving [Ames] on [her] team,\u201d and thanked Ames for her \n\u201cdedication to ensuring sexual safety\u201d across the \nDepartment\u2019s various facilities.  J.A. 235.  Ames\u2019s 2017 \nand 2018 reviews were both approved by Julie Walburn, \nthen-Assistant Director of the Department.  J.A. 227; J.A. \n236. \n2.  In April 2019, Ames applied to be the Department\u2019s \nBureau Chief of Quality Assurance and Improv\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

Forklift Sys., Inc., 510 U.S. 17, 22 \n(1993).  It does so in clear and plain terms, making it \n\u201cunlawful\u201d for any \u201cemployer to fail or refuse to hire or to \ndischarge any individual, or otherwise to discriminate \nagainst any individual . . . because of such individual\u2019s \nrace, color, religion, sex, or national origin.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 2000e-2.  That mandate, as this Court has explained, \nserves the \u201ccentral statutory purpose[] of eradicating  \ndiscrimination throughout the economy.\u201d  Albemarle \nPaper Co. v. Moody, 422 U.S. 405, 421 (1975).  \nYet in several circuits for several decades, courts have \nmade it harder to eradicate discrimination by imposing a \n\u201cbackground circumstances\u201d requirement on majority-\ngroup plaintiffs, and only those plaintiffs.  P.A. 5a.  Under \nthat requirement, a plaintiff who is a member of the \nmajority group must, in addition to Title VII\u2019s other \nelements, show \u201cbackground circumstances to support \nthe suspicion that the defendant is that unusual employer \nwho discriminates against the majority.\u201d  Id.  That \nadditional, heightened burden proved dispositive for \nMarlean Ames.  As the Sixth Circuit acknowledged, \nwithout a \u201cbackground circumstances\u201d requirement, \n\u201cAmes\u2019s prima-facie case was easy to make.\u201d  Id.  And \nbecause \u201cAmes\u2019s evidence of pretext is notably stronger \nfor [her sexual orientation discrimination] claim than for \nher\u201d other claims, Judge Kethledge stressed that Ames \nwas \u201cden[ied] . . . a jury trial\u201d \u201c[b]ased [on] our application \nof the \u2018background circumstances\u2019 rule alone.\u201d  P.A. 10a \n(Kethledge, J., concurring).  \nAmes is a heterosexual woman.  P.A. 5a.  She joined \nthe Ohio Department of Youth Services in 2004, starting \n\n2 \n \n \nout as an Executive Secretary before earning several \npromotions and becoming the Program Administrator for \nthe Prison Rape Elimination Act (\u201cPREA\u201d) in 2014.  P.A. \n16a\u201317a.  Ames\u2019s 2018 review noted that she \u201cha[d] met \nall of her goals and performance expectations,\u201d that she \nwas doing \u201ca good job in her role as PREA \nAdministrator,\u201d and that it was \u201ca pleasure having \nMarlean on [the] team.\u201d  J.A. 235.  Her prior reviews had \nbeen similar; from 2016 to 2018, Ames met or exceeded \nexpectations \nacross \nevery \ndimension \nin \nevery \nperformance review.  J.A. 215\u201337. \nIn 2019, Ames applied and interviewed for a promotion \nto Bureau Chief, but did not get the job.  P.A. 4a.  Instead, \nthe position remained vacant for eight months, before the \nDepartment offered it to a gay woman who (1) started \nafter Ames, (2) did not interview or apply for the job, and \n(3) was \u201carguably less qualified,\u201d thereby requiring the \nDepartment to \u201ccircumvent its own internal procedures\u201d \nto hire her.  P.A. 20a\u201321a; J.A. 152; P.A. 10a (Kethledge, \nJ., concurring) (cleaned up).   \nShortly after Ames was denied the promotion, the \nDepartment also removed her from the Program \nAdministrator role, giving her the choice between a \ndemotion back to Executive Secretary\u2014a position she \nheld a decade ago\u2014or termination.  P.A. 4a; P.A. 16a.  She \nchose the former.   \nIn her place, the Department hired a gay man who, \nmuch like the gay woman hired for the Bureau Chief \nposition, was \u201cneither qualified\u201d nor had \u201cformally \napplied\u201d for the role.  P.A. 44a.  Moreover, this man had \ntold many coworkers that he \u201cwanted Ms. Ames\u2019s job,\u201d \nincluding his first supervisor, his second supervisor, Ames \nherself, and Ames\u2019s supervisor.  J.A. 82\u201383; J.A. 132; J.A. \n147; J.A. 174\u201375.  Additionally, in conversations with \n\n3 \n \n \nAmes, he \u201cclaim[ed] that he could manipulate people to \nget what he wanted on the basis of being a gay man.\u201d  P.A. \n23a.   \nSuch facts, the Sixth Circuit observed, would satisfy \nthe usual prerequisites for establishing a prima facie case \nof discrimination:  Ames\u2019s \u201cclaim is based on sexual \norientation, which is a protected ground under Title VII; \nshe was demoted from her position as PREA \nAdministrator and had held that position for five years, \nwith reasonably good reviews; and she was replaced by a \ngay man.  Moreover, for the Bureau Chief position that \nAmes was denied, the Department chose a gay woman.\u201d  \nP.A. 5a. (citing Bostock v. Clayton County, 590 U.S. 644, \n649\u201353 (2020)).  But because \u201cAmes is heterosexual,\u201d she \n\u201cmust make a showing in addition to the usual ones for \nestablishing a prima-facie case\u201d\u2014i.e., she must prove \n\u201cbackground circumstances.\u201d  Id.  Majority-group \nplaintiffs \u201cmake that showing,\u201d the court continued, \u201cwith \nevidence that a member of the relevant minority group \n(here, gay people) made the employment decision at issue, \nor with statistical evidence showing a pattern of \ndiscrimination by the employer against members of the \nmajority group.\u201d  P.A. at 5a\u20136a.  Because Ames had done \nneither, her claim could not get past the first part of the \nfirst step of the McDonnell Douglas v. Green framework.   \nPut differently, if Ames were gay and the employees \nhired in preference of her were not, she would have \nestablished the elements necessary for her prima-facie \ncase.  P.A. 5a.  But because Ames falls on the majority-\ngroup side of the majority/minority fault line, she has no \nlegal recourse.   \nThat jarring result cannot be consistent with Title VII.  \nIt contravenes the text because the \u201cstatute\u2019s focus on the \nindividual is unambiguous.\u201d  Connecticut v. Teal, 457 U.S. \n\n4 \n \n \n440, 455 (1982).  The Sixth Circuit\u2019s reading, in contrast, \nexplicitly \u201ctreats some \u2018individuals\u2019 worse than others\u2014in \nother words, it discriminates\u2014on the very grounds that \nthe statute forbids.\u201d  P.A. 10a (Kethledge, J., concurring).   \nThe result also conflicts with this Court\u2019s instruction \nthat, under Title VII, \u201c[d]iscriminatory preference for any \ngroup, minority or majority, is precisely and only what \nCongress has proscribed.\u201d  Griggs v. Duke Power Co., 401 \nU.S. 424, 431 (1971).  Thus, when deciding such cases, \ncourts must apply \u201cthe same standards\u201d to all plaintiffs \nalike.  McDonald v. Santa Fe Trail Transp. Co., 427 U.S. \n273, 280 (1976).  The federal government, for its part, has \nexplicitly disclaimed the \u201cbackground circumstances\u201d \nrequirement for decades.  See U.S. Equal Emp. \nOpportunity Comm\u2019n, EEOC-CVG-2006-1, Section 15 \nRace and Color Discrimination, at 15-II & n.23 (2006) \n(\u201cSome courts . . . take the position that\u201d a majority-group \nplaintiff \u201cmust meet a heightened standard of proof.  The \nCommission, in contrast, applies the same standard of \nproof.\u201d); accord EEOC-NVTA-0000-17, Facts About \nRace/Color Discrimination (1997) (same).   \nIn short, in enacting Title VII, Congress sought the \n\u201cremoval of artificial, arbitrary, and unnecessary barriers \nto employment when the barriers operate invidiously to \ndiscriminate on the basis of racial or other impermissible \nclassification.\u201d  Griggs, 401 U.S. at 431.  The \u201cbackground \ncircumstances\u201d requirement, as the Sixth Circuit all but \nacknowledges, is one of those barriers.  This Court should \nremove it.   \n \n\n5 \n \n \nOPINIONS BELOW \nThe opinion of the Sixth Circuit is published at 87 \nF.4th 822 (6th Cir. 2023) and is reproduced in the petition \nappendix at P.A. 2a\u201311a.  The district court\u2019s order on \nRespondent\u2019s \nmotion \nfor \nsummary \njudgment \nis \nunpublished and is reproduced at P.A. 13a\u201340a.  The \ndistrict court\u2019s order on Respondent\u2019s motion for \njudgment on the pleadings is unpublished and is \nreproduced at P.A. 42a\u201357a.   \n \nJURISDICTION \nThe Sixth Circuit issued its judgment on December 4, \n2023.  On February 22, 2024, the Court granted an \nextension of time to file a petition for a writ of certiorari.  \nThe petition for a writ of certiorari was filed on March 18, \n2024, and granted on October 4, 2024.  This Court has \njurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254(1).   \n \nSTATUTORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(a)(1) provides:   \n \nIt shall be an unlawful employment practice \nfor an employer to fail or refuse to hire or to \ndischarge any individual, or otherwise to \ndiscriminate against any individual with \nrespect \nto \nhis \ncompensation, \nterms, \nconditions, or privileges of employment, \nbecause of such individual\u2019s race, color, \nreligion, sex, or national origin. \n  \n\n6 \n \n \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nA. Legal framework. \n1.  A Title VII plaintiff \u201cmay prove his case by direct \nor circumstantial evidence.\u201d  U.S. Postal Serv. Bd. of \nGovernors v. Aikens, 460 U.S. 711, 714 n.3 (1983).  \nBecause \u201c[t]here will seldom be \u2018eyewitness\u2019 testimony as \nto the employer\u2019s mental processes,\u201d id. at 716, this Court \narticulated in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 \nU.S. 792 (1973), a \u201ctool for assessing claims, typically at \nsummary judgment, when the plaintiff relies on indirect \nproof of discrimination,\u201d Comcast Corp. v. Nat\u2019l Ass\u2019n of \nAfr. Am. Owned Media, 589 U.S. 327, 340 (2020).   \nFor that framework, a plaintiff must \u201ccarry the initial \nburden under the statute of establishing a prima facie \ncase\u201d of discrimination.  McDonnell Douglas, 411 U.S. at \n802.  \u201cThe burden of making this showing is \u2018not onerous.\u2019\u201d  \nYoung v. United Parcel Serv., Inc., 575 U.S. 206, 228 \n(2015) (quoting Tex. Dep\u2019t of Cmty. Affs. v. Burdine, 450 \nU.S. 248, 253 (1981)).  In McDonnell Douglas itself, for \ninstance, the plaintiff established a prima facie case \u201cby \nshowing (i) that he belong[ed] to a racial minority; (ii) that \nhe applied and was qualified for a job for which the \nemployer was seeking applicants; (iii) that, despite his \nqualifications, he was rejected; and (iv) that, after his \nrejection, the position remained open and the employer \ncontinued \nto \nseek \napplicants \nfrom \npersons \nof \ncomplainant\u2019s qualifications.\u201d  411 U.S. at 802.   \nOnce the prima facie case is established, the burden \n\u201cshift[s] to the employer to articulate some legitimate, \nnondiscriminatory reason for the employee\u2019s rejection.\u201d  \nId.  Finally, the burden returns to the plaintiff to show \n\n7 \n \n \nthat the employer\u2019s \u201cstated reason\u201d for its employment \naction \u201cwas in fact pretext.\u201d  Id. at 804.   \n2.  The \u201cbackground circumstances\u201d rule, first applied \nby the D.C. Circuit in Parker v. Baltimore & Ohio \nRailroad, adds to the traditional McDonnell Douglas \nframework.  652 F.2d 1012 (D.C. Cir. 1981).   \nIn Parker, a white man \u201cclaim[ed] that his efforts to \nbecome a locomotive fireman were defeated by illegal \npreferences given to black and female applicants.\u201d  Id. at \n1014.  In evaluating Parker\u2019s claim, the D.C. Circuit \nopined that \u201c[m]embership in a socially disfavored group \nwas the assumption on which the entire McDonnell \nDouglas analysis was predicated, for only in that context \ncan\u201d there be an \u201cinfer[ence] [of] discriminatory motive \nfrom the unexplained hiring of an outsider rather than a \ngroup member.\u201d  Id. at 1017.  Thus, although \u201c[w]hites are \nalso a protected group under Title VII,\u201d the D.C. Circuit \nbelieved that \u201cit defie[d] common sense to suggest that \nthe promotion of a black employee justifies an inference \nof prejudice against white co-workers in our present \nsociety.\u201d  Id.  Consequently, \u201cto prove a prima facie case \nof intentionally disparate treatment,\u201d the D.C. Circuit \nheld that a majority-group plaintiff must point to \n\u201cbackground circumstances [which] support the suspicion \nthat the defendant is that unusual employer who \ndiscriminates against the majority.\u201d  Id.  \n3.  Four other courts of appeals, including the Sixth \nCircuit, \nhave \nsince \nadopted \na \n\u201cbackground \ncircumstances\u201d requirement, generally citing either \nParker or a subsequent case applying Parker.  See, e.g., \nMurray v. Thistledown Racing Club, Inc., 770 F.2d 63, 67 \n(6th Cir. 1985); Mills v. Health Care Serv. Corp., 171 F.3d \n450, 455\u201357 (7th Cir. 1999); Hammer v. Ashcroft, 383 F.3d \n\n8 \n \n \n722, 724 (8th Cir. 2004); Notari v. Denver Water Dep\u2019t, 971 \nF.2d 585, 588\u201389 (10th Cir. 1992).   \nB. Factual background.1 \n1.  The Ohio Department of Youth Services (\u201cthe \nDepartment\u201d) is \u201ca state agency that oversees juvenile \ncorrections, parole, and the rehabilitation of youth \nthrough community programs.\u201d  P.A. 14a.  Marlean Ames \nwas hired as an Executive Secretary for the Department \nin 2004.  P.A. 16a.  She was promoted in 2009 to \nCommunity Facility Liaison.  Id.  In that role, Ames was \nsupervised for several years by then-Deputy Director \nRyan Gies, who \u201csigned off on strong reviews of her \nperformance each year between 2011 [and] 2013.\u201d  P.A. \n22a.  These reviews described Ames as \u201can invaluable \nasset\u201d and underscored her \u201ccontribution to the positive \nculture in the Division.\u201d  J.A. 207; J.A. 213. \nIn 2014, the Department promoted Ames again, this \ntime to PREA Administrator.  P.A. 3a.  In that role, Ames \nreported to Wendi Faulkner.  J.A. 97.  On Ames\u2019s 2016 \nyear-end review, Faulkner rated Ames overall as \nexceeding expectations.  J.A. 215\u201318.  Faulkner observed \nthat Ames had done \u201ca stellar job of representing not only \nthe division, but the agency,\u201d that Ames had \u201cbecome a \nfederally-certified PREA Auditor to further her \nknowledge,\u201d and that Ames was \u201ctruly . . . a value-added \nmember of the team.\u201d  J.A. 216\u201318. \nIn 2017, Ames began reporting to Ginine Trim, a gay \nwoman.  P.A. 3a.  In her 2017 year-end review, Faulkner \n \n1 Because this matter arises in a summary judgment posture, the \nfacts are viewed in the light most favorable to Ames, with reasonable \ninferences drawn in her favor.  Tolan v. Cotton, 572 U.S. 650, 651 \n(2014) (citing Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 255 \n(1986)).   \n\n9 \n \n \nand Trim again rated Ames as meeting or exceeding \nexpectations in all competencies.  J.A. 220\u201326.  It noted \nthat she \u201cdoes well working with groups,\u201d was a \u201cteam \nplayer,\u201d and \u201cwork[ed] well with others.\u201d  J.A. 223; J.A. \n226.  \u201cOverall,\u201d the review concluded that \u201cMarlean is \ndoing a good job in her role,\u201d expressed \u201cthank[s]\u201d for her \n\u201chard work and commitment,\u201d and stated that it was \u201ca \npleasure having [Ames] on [the] team.\u201d  J.A. 226.   \nHer 2018 review was substantially similar.  Trim rated \nAmes as meeting or exceeding expectations in all \ncompetencies and commended her for being \u201c[v]ery \ncompetent in her role as PREA administrator.\u201d  J.A. 229\u2013\n35.  The evaluation added that Ames is \u201calways willing to \nassist others\u201d and \u201cdoes well coordinating and working \nwith her peers.\u201d  J.A. 230; J.A. 232.  The review observed \nthat Ames could \u201cassume a more active role in managing\u201d \nPREA grant funds, but nevertheless rated Ames as \nmeeting expectations on this metric.  J.A. 234.  Ultimately, \nTrim noted that she looked forward to watching Ames \ncontinue to grow in her role, stated that it was a \u201cpleasure \nhaving [Ames] on [her] team,\u201d and thanked Ames for her \n\u201cdedication to ensuring sexual safety\u201d across the \nDepartment\u2019s various facilities.  J.A. 235.  Ames\u2019s 2017 \nand 2018 reviews were both approved by Julie Walburn, \nthen-Assistant Director of the Department.  J.A. 227; J.A. \n236. \n2.  In April 2019, Ames applied to be the Department\u2019s \nBureau Chief of Quality Assurance and Improvement, \nafter Trim posted news of the opening and invited \nDepartment employees to apply.  P.A. 19a.  The position \nwould oversee PREA administration, as well as other \nresponsibilities.  J.A. 111\u201316; J.A. 160\u201361.  Two other \nwomen, both heterosexual, also applied for the position.  \nJ.A. 109\u201310.   \n\n10 \n \n \nAll three women interviewed with Trim and Walburn \nin April 2019.  P.A. 19a; J.A. 117.  Before the interview, \nAmes submitted her resume, J.A. 114, and undertook \n\u201cresearch . . . look[ing] at numbers that [the] bureau \ncompiled over a period of time,\u201d including \u201careas where \nfacilities had reported some deficiencies that they would \nlike to see changed,\u201d J.A. 113\u201314.  From there, Ames \nprepared a summary of her findings and \u201cprinted off an \narticle\u201d about the \u201cjuvenile justice system\u201d reflecting her \nvision to address challenges facing the facilities in a \u201cmore \nholistic fashion.\u201d  J.A. 114.  She presented these materials \nto Trim and Walburn at the interview.  J.A. 115.   \nAlthough Ames was \u201cqualified [for the promotion] and \nfulfill[ed] the application requirements,\u201d and although \nAmes believed that she received \u201cpositive feedback\u201d \nduring the interview, she was not offered the Bureau \nChief position.  P.A. 19a\u201320a; P.A. 44a.  Neither were the \nother two women who applied and interviewed.  J.A. 186.  \nAccording to Walburn and Trim, Ames was not selected \nbecause she \u201cfailed to lay out her \u2018vision for . . . how to get \nthe job done.\u2019\u201d  P.A. 20a.  Trim gave \u201cthe same reason[]\u201d\u2014\na lack of vision\u2014for why the other two applicants had not \nbeen offered the role.  J.A. 186.  Walburn and Trim did not \nkeep notes from any of these interviews, nor did Walburn \ndocument in writing any of the reasons for denying the \npromotion to Ames or to the other applicants.  J.A. 60\u201361; \nJ.A. 181.   \nThe position went unfilled for several months.  In \nDecember 2019, Trim \u201coffered the Bureau Chief position\u201d \nto Yolonda Frierson, a gay woman.  P.A. 20a.  Frierson \n\u201cdid not apply for\u201d nor \u201cinterview for\u201d the role.  J.A. 152.  \nInstead, according to Frierson, \u201cTrim came to\u201d her when \n\u201c[t]here was no one else around\u201d and said:  \u201cI would like \n\n11 \n \n \nfor you to serve in this position, I would like you to serve \nin this role.\u201d  J.A. 151.  Frierson accepted the promotion. \nFrierson had started at the Department two years \nafter Ames.  J.A. 140.  At the time she was offered the \nBureau Chief role, she had, unlike Ames, obtained neither \na college degree nor a PREA certificate.  J.A. 152; J.A. \n160\u201361.  Because Frierson \u201clacked the minimum \nqualifications for the job\u201d and did not apply or interview \nfor the position, Ames testified that \u201cthe Department \ncircumvented its own internal procedures\u201d to offer her the \nBureau Chief role.  P.A. 10a (Kethledge, J., concurring).  \nIn particular, a few days after Frierson\u2019s conversation \nwith Trim, Department HR informed Frierson \u201cthat it \nwould be best to start the [Bureau Chief] position in a \ntemporary position\u201d at the end of 2019.  J.A. 158.  \nAccording to Ames, Trim \u201cplaced [Frierson] in a \ntemporary working level so that she got the experience\u201d \nnecessary to \u201cjustify awarding the position to her\u201d on a \npermanent basis.  J.A. 123.  In January 2020, after a few \nweeks in this temporary role, Frierson assumed the \nposition on a permanent basis.  J.A. 150.   \n3.  Ames was not only passed over for Bureau Chief.  \nOn May 10, 2019, Walburn and a member of the \nDepartment\u2019s HR team called Ames into a meeting to tell \nher that she was also being removed as PREA \nAdministrator.  P.A. 4a.  When Ames \u201casked [Walburn] \nwhy she was doing this,\u201d Walburn \u201craise[d] her voice and \nsa[id], I\u2019m not going to hash this out with you.  You can \nsign the paper [accepting a demotion] and have a job, or \ndon\u2019t sign the paper and don\u2019t [have] a job.  Either way, I \ndon\u2019t care.  We\u2019re moving PREA in a new direction.\u201d  J.A. \n98\u201399.  Ames was given the choice of being demoted to \nExecutive Secretary, a role she was first hired for in 2004, \nor being terminated.  P.A. 3a; P.A. 44a.   \n\n12 \n \n \nWhile weighing the choice between demotion and \ntermination, Ames ran into Trim, and Trim told her that \n\u201cif [Ames] should be mad at anyone, be mad at her.\u201d  J.A. \n124.  Ames ultimately accepted the demotion and, as a \nresult, her pay was cut nearly in half, from $47.22 to $28.40 \nper hour.  P.A. 4a.   \nGies, Walburn, and Trim each offered different \nreasons for Ames\u2019s demotion.  Gies testified that he had \nheard from community partners that \u201cAmes was difficult \nto work with\u201d and \u201cnot collaborative.\u201d  P.A. 22a.  But Gies \nalso testified that he did \u201cnot memorialize in writing\u201d any \nof these concerns, J.A. 23; could not point to \u201cany specific \ne-mails\u201d or documents supporting these concerns, J.A. 20; \nand could not recall any examples of conflict beyond \nunverified complaints over Ames requesting \u201cinformation \non [facilities] staffing and not explaining why,\u201d J.A. 21.  \nHe further acknowledged that Ames\u2019s annual reviews did \nnot reflect any of these issues.  J.A. 32\u201333. \nFor Walburn, \u201c[t]he lack of vision identified by \nWalburn during Ames\u2019s interview for Bureau Chief\u201d \nnecessitated \u201cher removal from her position as PREA \nAdministrator as well.\u201d  P.A. 21a.  Based on that \ninterview, Walburn claims to have developed concerns \nover whether Ames \u201cwas being proactive enough\u201d and \nwhether Ames could \u201cprevent[] victimization from \noccurring.\u201d  J.A. 51; P.A. 22a.  But like Gies, Walburn \ncould not recall specific instances of communicating these \nconcerns with Ames, never memorialized any of her \nalleged concerns in writing, and never placed Ames on a \ndisciplinary or performance improvement plan.  J.A. 53.   \nFinally, Trim pointed to \u201cthe slow rollout of grants,\u201d \nP.A. 22a, but acknowledged that she ultimately rated \nAmes as having \u201cmet expectations\u201d on this metric in each \nof her annual reviews, J.A. 170; J.A. 225; J.A. 234.  Trim \n\n13 \n \n \nalso admitted that \u201cthe grant money had already lapsed\u201d \nby the time of Ames\u2019s demotion, so that there were no \nfurther grants to manage.  J.A. 202.  Ames, for her part, \nstated that she had \u201cnever been told any reason why [she] \ndidn\u2019t get [the Bureau Chief] position\u201d and had \u201cnever \nbeen told any reason why [she] was demoted.\u201d  J.A. 120.   \n4.  Two days after Ames\u2019s demotion, the Department \nselected Alexander Stojsavljevic, a gay man, to take her \nplace as PREA Administrator.  P.A. 4a.   \nStojsavljevic joined the Department in May 2017 as a \nsocial worker in a local branch office.  P.A. 43a.  In October \n2017, he applied for, interviewed, and was promoted to \nPREA Compliance Manager, and began working at \nDepartment headquarters.   J.A. 78\u201381.   \nSoon \nafter \nbecoming \nCompliance \nManager, \nStojsavljevic expressed to Ames an \u201cimpatient attitude \ntowards climbing the ranks within the Department\u201d and \n\u201cclaim[ed] that he could manipulate people to get what he \nwanted on the basis of being a gay man.\u201d  P.A. 23a.  He \nalso \u201cacknowledge[d]\u201d that he had \u201cbeen angling for \nAmes\u2019s position for some time, stating in front of their \ncoworkers that he wanted the PREA Administrator \nposition.\u201d \n \nId. \n \nAmong \nthose \ncoworkers \nwere \nStojsavljevic\u2019s first and second supervisors, J.A. 82\u201383; \nFrierson, J.A. 147; Trim, J.A. 92, J.A. 174\u201375; Ames \nherself, J.A. 147; and other supervisors and members of \nthe Department, J.A. 90\u201391; J.A. 125.  Although \nStojsavljevic initially characterized these statements \u201cas \nan inside joke,\u201d P.A. 23a, he ultimately acknowledged \nduring his deposition that he did, in fact, \u201cwant[] to be the \nPREA administrator\u201d and that he also \u201cknew [Ames] \nwanted to stay in that position.\u201d  J.A. 82; 84.  Ames, for \nher part, testified that she \u201ccomplained to\u201d Trim that \nStojsavljevic needed \u201cto stop walking around telling \n\n14 \n \n \neverybody he wants my job.\u201d  J.A. 130.  She also alleged \nthat Stojsavljevic \u201ctold Trim\u2014in front of [Ames]\u2014that \n[Ames] should retire.\u201d  P.A. 43a.  \nJust before his promotion to PREA Administrator, \nStojsavljevic received a preliminary probationary review, \nevaluating his performance as PREA Compliance \nManager from late 2018 to May 2019.  J.A. 238.  On his \noverall performance, Stojsavljevic was graded as meeting \nexpectations\u2014the same rating Ames received as PREA \nAdministrator.  J.A. 241.  His review noted that \nStojsavljevic was \u201cprofessional, knowledgeable, timely, \n[and] organized,\u201d but also that he \u201chad some tough audits\u201d \nduring his first \u201csix months\u201d on the job.  J.A. 241\u201342. \n5.  Much like Frierson with the Bureau Chief role, the \nDepartment \nappointed \nStojsavljevic \nPREA \nAdministrator \u201c[d]espite\u201d him never \u201chaving formally \napplied\u201d or interviewed for the role.  P.A. 44a; J.A. 88\u201390.  \nNor did the Department publicly post an opening, seek \nother applications, or consider other candidates for the \nPREA Administrator position.  J.A. 45\u201346; J.A. 89; J.A. \n94.  Instead, Stojsavljevic was offered the job during a \nprivate, one-on-one meeting with Walburn.  J.A. 89.  \nStojsavljevic accepted the position.  J.A. 90.   \nFollowing \nhis \nconversation \nwith \nWalburn, \nDepartment HR \u201creach[ed] out to\u201d Stojsavljevic and \nasked him to \u201cfill out an application\u201d even though he had \nalready \u201cverbally agreed to the job.\u201d  J.A. 93.  Walburn \nand Department HR also \u201cinstructed\u201d Stojsavljevic \u201cto be \nquiet\u201d and \u201cto not say anything until all the paperwork \nhad gone through and everything [was] approved.\u201d  J.A. \n94.  Even so, the Department at this time publicly posted \nan opening for the role that Stojsavljevic was leaving (his \nCompliance Manager position), thus prompting several \ncoworkers to suspect that Stojsavljevic \u201cwas going to \n\n15 \n \n \nbecome the PREA administrator\u201d and to congratulate \nhim on his promotion.  Id.      \nAmes remains at the Department today.  She has, \nfollowing her 2019 demotion, since been promoted to \nHuman Services Program Administrator.  P.A. 18a. \nC. Proceedings below. \n1.  On August 21, 2019, Ames filed a charge of \ndiscrimination against the Department with the Ohio Civil \nRights \nCommission \nand \nthe \nEqual Employment \nOpportunity Commission.  P.A. 25a.   \nThe \nEEOC \nconducted \nan \ninvestigation \nand \ndetermined that Ames (1) \u201capplied and was qualified for \nthe vacant position\u201d of Bureau Chief, (2) \u201cand was \nrejected in favor of a less qualified person outside her \nprotected groups.\u201d  J.A. 2.  The investigation also found \nthat Ames \u201cfelt compelled to fall back to her previous \nposition with a significant loss of income\u201d even though \n\u201cothers outside her protected groups were either not \ndemoted or did not receive such a significant decrease in \ntheir compensation.\u201d  J.A. 3.  Accordingly, the EEOC \nfound there was \u201creasonable cause to believe that [Ames] \nwas discriminated against\u201d on account of her age, sex, and \nsexual orientation.  Id.  The Commission issued Ames a \nright to sue letter.  P.A. 25a.   \n2.  Ames filed suit in the Southern District of Ohio.  Id.  \nHer complaint asserted causes of action under Title VII, \nthe Fourteenth Amendment, the Age Discrimination in \nEmployment Act (\u201cADEA\u201d), and state law.  Id.  \nOn March 29, 2022, the district court dismissed Ames\u2019s \nFourteenth \nAmendment \nclaim, \nruling \nthat \nthe \nDepartment was not a \u201cperson\u201d for purposes of 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1983.  P.A. 49a\u201350a.  It also dismissed Ames\u2019s ADEA \n\n16 \n \n \nand state law claims, reasoning that because the State of \nOhio had not \u201cwaived its immunity,\u201d the court lacked \nsubject-matter jurisdiction.  P.A. 47a; P.A. 49a.   \nFinally, Ames\u2019s complaint alleged three Title VII \nviolations for (1) hostile work environment, (2) retaliation, \nand (3) sex and sexual orientation discrimination.  P.A. \n25a.  The district court dismissed the hostile work \nenvironment and retaliation claims for failure to state a \nclaim.  P.A. 57a; P.A. 53a.  The Department did not move \nto dismiss, and the district court did not address, Ames\u2019s \nclaim of sex and sexual orientation discrimination.   \n3.  Following discovery, the Department moved for \nsummary judgment on Ames\u2019s remaining claim for sex \nand sexual orientation discrimination.  P.A. 26a.   \nAs to sex discrimination, Ames maintained that the \nDepartment discriminated against her because \u201cshe was \ndemoted and replaced [as PREA Administrator] by \nStojsavljevic,\u201d a man.  P.A. 34a.  On sexual orientation \ndiscrimination, Ames pointed to the fact that she was \ndenied a promotion to Bureau Chief in favor of a gay \nwoman and later removed from her position as PREA \nAdministrator in favor of a gay man.  P.A. 30a\u201334a.   \nIn seeking summary judgment, the Department asked \nthe court to apply the traditional \u201cMcDonnell Douglas \nburden-shifting framework\u201d to Ames\u2019s sex discrimination \nclaim.  Dist. Ct. Dkt 71 (\u201cDep\u2019t MSJ\u201d) at 17.  But because \n\u201cAmes\u2019s claim of [sexual orientation] discrimination\u201d was \n\u201cbased \nupon \nher \nheterosexual \norientation,\u201d \nthe \nDepartment asserted that an additional showing was \nnecessary.  Id. at 20.  That is because \u201cthe Sixth Circuit \nrequires a higher burden of proof for plaintiffs[] who are \nmembers of majority classifications.\u201d  Id.  Specifically, \nmajority-group plaintiffs must \u201cestablish background \n\n17 \n \n \ncircumstances to support the suspicion that the defendant \nis that unusual employer who discriminates against the \nmajority.\u2019\u201d  Id. (cleaned up).  These \u201c[b]ackground \ncircumstances\u201d include \u201cstatistical evidence,\u201d \u201cevidence \nthat the person responsible for the employment decision \nwas a minority,\u201d or \u201cevidence of ongoing racial tension in \nthe workplace.\u201d  Id.   \n4.  The district court granted the Department\u2019s \nmotion.   \nOn Ames\u2019s sex discrimination charge, the district \ncourt held that Ames had \u201ccarr[ied] her burden of \nestablishing a prima facie claim\u201d under McDonnell \nDouglas.  P.A. 34a.  But the Department had, in the \ncourt\u2019s view, offered \u201clegitimate, nondiscriminatory \nbusiness reasons\u201d behind its decision: a \u201cdesire to revamp \nthe Department\u2019s PREA strategy\u201d and a concern over \nAmes\u2019s \u201cvision, ability, [and] leadership skills.\u201d  P.A. 35a.  \nThis \u201cshift[ed]\u201d the \u201cburden of production\u201d back to Ames \n\u201cto show that [these] proffered reason[s] [were] \npretextual.\u201d  P.A. 38a.  According to the district court, \nAmes had not cleared that bar.  P.A. 38a\u201340a. \nAs to sexual orientation discrimination, the district \ncourt agreed with the Department that, as \u201ca member of \na majority group,\u201d Ames \u201cbears an additional \u2018burden\u2019\u201d:  \nShe must \u201cshow that \u2018background circumstances support \nthe suspicion that the defendant is that unusual employer \nwho discriminates against the majority\u2019 to establish the \nfirst prong of the prima facie case.\u201d  P.A. 28a (first \nquoting Murray, 770 F.2d at 67; and then quoting Parker, \n652 F.2d at 1017).  To do so, Ames could come forward \nwith evidence \u201cthat a minority employer replaced the \nplaintiff with another employee of the same minority \ngroup\u201d or with a \u201cstatistical analysis of the employer\u2019s \n\n18 \n \n \nunlawful consideration of protected characteristics in past \nemployment decisions.\u201d  P.A. 30a\u201331a.   \nAmes \nwas \n\u201cunable \nto \nmeet \nthis \nthreshold \nrequirement.\u201d  P.A. 31a.  To be sure, Trim is gay, and she \nwas one of two people who interviewed Ames for the \npromotion.  P.A. 20a\u201321a.  She also told Ames, on Ames\u2019s \ndemotion, that \u201cif [Ames] should be mad at anyone,\u201d to \n\u201cbe mad at her.\u201d  J.A. 124.  But Trim did not have formal \ndecision-making authority\u2014that rested with Gies and \nWalburn\u2014making \nTrim\u2019s \nrole \nirrelevant \nfor \nthe \n\u201cbackground circumstances\u201d requirement.  P.A. 6a. \nSecond, though Ames had pointed to several adverse \nemployment actions taken against her, these \u201cdata points \n[were] not enough to establish a pattern\u201d for the \n\u201cbackground \ncircumstances\u201d \nrule. \n \nP.A. \n32a.  \n\u201c[E]xtensive, rigorous evidence is required to establish a \npattern for the purposes of \u2018background circumstances,\u2019\u201d \nand Ames\u2019s own individual experiences were insufficient.  \nId.; accord P.A. 6a.   \n5.  Ames appealed her sex and sexual orientation \ndiscrimination claim to the Sixth Circuit.  On sex \ndiscrimination, the Sixth Circuit affirmed the district \ncourt.  P.A. 6a\u20138a.  Ames does not seek review of that \nruling before this Court.   \nOn sexual orientation discrimination, the Sixth Circuit \nheld that the \u201cprincipal issue\u201d was whether Ames had \n\u201cmade \nthe \nnecessary \nshowing \nof \n\u2018background \ncircumstances.\u2019\u201d  P.A. 5a.  That is because, as the panel \nexplained, Ames\u2019s case under McDonnell Douglas was \notherwise \u201ceasy to make.\u201d  Id.  Ames was a member of a \nprotected class, received \u201creasonably good reviews\u201d as \nPREA Administrator, was demoted in favor of a gay man, \nand was denied a promotion to Bureau Chief in favor of a \n\n19 \n \n \ngay woman.  Id.  \u201cWhere Ames founders, however, is on \nthe requisite showing of \u2018background circumstances.\u2019\u201d  Id.  \nEchoing the district court, the Sixth Circuit noted that \n\u201c[p]laintiffs typically make that showing with evidence \nthat a member of the relevant minority group (here, gay \npeople) made the employment decision at issue, or with \nstatistical evidence showing a pattern of discrimination by \nthe employer against members of the majority group.\u201d  \nP.A. 5a\u20136a.  Ames had checked neither box.  \nJudge Kethledge concurred.  In line with the majority, \nhe agreed that \u201cbackground circumstances\u201d alone \nprevented Ames from moving forward with her claim.  \n\u201c[N]obody,\u201d Judge Kethledge underscored, \u201cdisputes \nthat Ames has established the other elements of her \nprima-facie case.\u201d  P.A. 10a.  He also emphasized that \nbecause \u201cAmes\u2019s evidence of pretext is notably stronger \nfor this claim than for her sex-discrimination one,\u201d \u201cwe \ndeny Ames a jury trial\u201d as to sexual orientation \ndiscrimination \u201cbased [on] our application of the \n\u2018background circumstances\u2019 rule alone.\u201d  Id.   \nJudge \nKethledge \nwent \non \nto \n\u201cexpress \n[his] \ndisagreement\u201d with the \u201cbackground circumstances\u201d \nrequirement.  P.A. 9a.  Although he acknowledged that \ncircuit precedent \u201cbound\u201d the court, he asserted that the \nSixth Circuit and several other courts of appeals had \u201clost \ntheir bearings in adopting this rule.\u201d  Id.; P.A. 11a.  Title \nVII, Judge Kethledge explained, bars discrimination \nbased on an individual\u2019s \u201crace, color, religion, sex, or \nnational origin.\u201d  P.A. 9a (quoting 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-\n2(a)(1)).  \u201cThe statute,\u201d he emphasized, \u201cexpressly \nextends its protection to \u2018any individual.\u2019\u201d  P.A. 10a.  Yet \na \u201cbackground circumstances\u201d requirement explicitly \n\u201ctreats some \u2018individuals\u2019 worse than others\u2014in other \nwords, it discriminates\u2014on the very grounds that the \n\n20 \n \n \nstatute forbids.\u201d  Id.  Judge Kethledge characterized \n\u201cbackground circumstances\u201d as not \u201ca gloss upon the 1964 \nAct, but a deep scratch against its surface.\u201d  Id.    \n \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nI.  Courts that have adopted the \u201cbackground \ncircumstances\u201d requirement acknowledge that it imposes \n\u201ca different and more difficult prima facie burden\u201d on \nmajority-group plaintiffs.  Briggs v. Potter, 463 F.3d 507, \n517 (6th Cir. 2006); accord, e.g., Gore v. Indiana Univ., \n416 F.3d 590, 593 (7th Cir. 2005); Adamson v. Multi Cmty. \nDiversified Servs., Inc., 514 F.3d 1136, 1141 (10th Cir. \n2008).  That heightened evidentiary burden contravenes \nTitle VII\u2019s text, this Court\u2019s precedent, and longstanding \nfederal government practice.   \nI.A.  This Court has regularly and routinely rejected \nattempts to add to or remodel Title VII\u2019s text.  Last Term, \nfor instance, the Court unanimously rebuffed a \nheightened harm requirement for job transfer decisions, \nemphasizing that \u201c[n]othing in the provision . . . \nestablish[ed] an elevated threshold of harm,\u201d and \nchastised the court below for \u201cadd[ing] . . . significant \nwords . . . to the statute\u201d and \u201cdemand[ing] something \nmore of [plaintiffs] than the law as written.\u201d  Muldrow v. \nCity of St. Louis, 601 U.S. 346, 355 (2024).  Similarly, in \nEEOC v. Abercrombie & Fitch Stores, the Court declined \nto read an \u201cactual knowledge\u201d requirement into Title VII, \nbecause doing so would improperly \u201cadd words to the law\u201d \nthat are not there.  575 U.S. 768, 774 (2015). \nIf these cases show that applying heightened, \nextratextual burdens to all plaintiffs is impermissible, a \nheightened requirement for just one group of plaintiffs is \n\n21 \n \n \neven more suspect.  Title VII\u2019s text, after all, \u201ctells us . . . \nthat our focus should be on individuals, not groups.\u201d  \nBostock v. Clayton County, 590 U.S. 644, 658 (2020).  \nSeparating plaintiffs at the outset into groups flouts that \nclear instruction.  Worse, \u201cbackground circumstances\u201d \nseparates individuals based on their \u201crace, color, religion, \nsex, or national origin.\u201d  P.A. 9a (Kethledge, J., \nconcurring).  In applying a law whose purpose is to \n\u201ceradicat[e] discrimination,\u201d then, courts that embrace a \n\u201cbackground \ncircumstances\u201d \nrequirement \nmust \n\u201cdiscriminate[] on the very grounds that the statute \nforbids.\u201d  Albemarle Paper Co. v. Moody, 422 U.S. 405, \n421 (1975); P.A. 10a (Kethledge, J., concurring).   \nI.B.  \u201cBackground circumstances\u201d also runs afoul of \nprecedent.  Shortly after Title VII\u2019s enactment, this Court \nexplained that \u201c[d]iscriminatory preference for any \ngroup, minority or majority, is precisely and only what \nCongress has proscribed.\u201d  Griggs v. Duke Power Co., 401 \nU.S. 424, 431 (1971).  Nothing in McDonnell Douglas \nCorp. v. Green holds to the contrary. In fact, McDonnell \nDouglas not only cites Griggs but recites the very \nlanguage above.  411 U.S. 792, 800 (1973).   \nTo be sure, the specific plaintiff in McDonnell Douglas \nwas \u201ca racial minority,\u201d which formed part of his prima \nfacie case.  Id. at 802.  But that does not mean \u201cthe entire \nMcDonnell Douglas analysis was predicated\u201d on \n\u201c[m]embership in a socially disfavored group\u201d and that a \ndifferent and more demanding showing is therefore \nrequired of non-minority plaintiffs.  Parker v. Balt. & \nOhio R.R. Co., 652 F.2d 1012, 1017 (D.C. Cir. 1981).   \nIn fact, McDonald v. Santa Fe Trail Transportation \nspecifically examined this language from McDonnell \nDouglas and explained that, when it said the McDonnell \nDouglas plaintiff \u201cbelong[ed] to a racial minority,\u201d it did \n\n22 \n \n \nso \u201conly to demonstrate\u201d the \u201cracial character of the \ndiscrimination\u201d at issue.  427 U.S. 273, 279 n.6 (1976).  It \nwas not \u201can indication of any substantive limitation of \nTitle VII\u2019s prohibition of racial discrimination.\u201d  Id.  In \nother words, McDonnell Douglas referenced the \nplaintiff\u2019s race because the plaintiff had brought a race \ndiscrimination claim.  But while the facts will change\u2014\ne.g., the plaintiffs in McDonald were white\u2014the legal \nframework and analysis does not:  \u201cWe therefore hold \ntoday that Title VII prohibits racial discrimination \nagainst the white petitioners in this case upon the same \nstandards as would be applicable were they Negroes and \n[a similarly situated comparator] white.\u201d  Id. at 280. \nThis Court\u2019s post-McDonald cases are of a piece.  \nIndeed, the Court has never endorsed the understanding \nthat McDonnell Douglas was based on \u201cthe assumption\u201d \nof a plaintiff\u2019s \u201c[m]embership in a socially disfavored \ngroup.\u201d  Contra Parker, 652 F.2d at 1017.  Rather, the \nCourt has described McDonnell Douglas as simply \u201ca \nsensible\u201d way \u201cto evaluate the evidence.\u201d  Furnco Constr. \nCorp. v. Waters, 438 U.S. 567, 577 (1978).   \nMoreover, governing precedent in fact rejects the \nspecific requirements that lower courts have imposed on \nplaintiffs \nunder \nthe \nbanner \nof \n\u201cbackground \ncircumstances.\u201d  Here, for example, the panel required \nAmes to either (1) show \u201cthat a member of the relevant \nminority group (here, gay people) made the employment \ndecision at issue,\u201d or (2) produce \u201cstatistical evidence \nshowing a pattern of discrimination.\u201d  P.A. 5a.  But \n\u201cnothing in Title VII necessarily bars a claim of [sex] \ndiscrimination . . . merely because the plaintiff and the \ndefendant (or the person charged with acting on behalf of \nthe defendant) are of the same sex.\u201d  Oncale v. \nSundowner Offshore Servs., Inc., 523 U.S. 75, 79 (1998).  \n\n23 \n \n \nAnd Title VII gives \u201cno defense for the employer to note \nthat, while he treated [an] individual woman worse than \nhe would have treated a man, he gives preferential \ntreatment to female employees overall.\u201d  Bostock, 590 \nU.S. at 659.  That holding makes clear no individual Title \nVII plaintiff\u2014majority or minority\u2014need marshal \n\u201cextensive [and] rigorous\u201d statistical evidence to \n\u201cestablish a pattern\u201d of discrimination against a particular \ngroup.  P.A. 31a\u201332a. \nI.C.  The EEOC has disavowed the \u201cheightened \nstandard \nof \nproof\u201d \nrequired \nby \n\u201cbackground \ncircumstances.\u201d  U.S. Equal Emp. Opportunity Comm\u2019n, \nEEOC-CVG-2006-1, \nSection \n15 \nRace \nand \nColor \nDiscrimination (2006).  Instead, the Commission \u201capplies \nthe same standard of proof\u201d to all claims, \u201cregardless of \nthe victim\u2019s race or the type of evidence used.\u201d  Id. at nn. \n22\u201324.   \nII.A.  \u201cBackground circumstances\u201d also asks courts to \napply an \u201cirremediably vague and ill-defined,\u201d Iadimarco \nv. Runyon, 190 F.3d 151, 161 (3d Cir. 1999)\u2014if not \nunconstitutional\u2014requirement, see P.A. 11a (Kethledge, \nJ., concurring). \nTo begin, none of the courts of appeals that embrace \n\u201cbackground circumstances\u201d have explained how one \nshould go about determining \u201cmajority\u201d or \u201cminority\u201d \nstatus.  Should a judge look to the population as a whole, \nto the working-age population, to the make-up of a \nparticular workplace, or to an industry as a whole?  Should \nmajority-group status be indexed to a numerical ratio \nbased on local, state, or regional data?   \nAbsent such guidance, all of which itself would be \nextratextual, the threshold question of whether a \n\u201cbackground circumstances\u201d requirement even applies to \n\n24 \n \n \na case often turns \u201cupon personal and societal judgments \nthat . . . vary from judge to judge.\u201d  Christian Joshua \nMyers, The Confusion of McDonnell Douglas: A Path \nForward for Reverse Discrimination Claims, 44 \nSEATTLE U. L. REV. 1065, 1121 (2021).  Some courts, for \ninstance, invoke \u201cbackground circumstances\u201d not based \non whether a plaintiff is part of a numerical majority, but \nwhether they fall within a group that has been \u201csocially \ndisfavored.\u201d  See, e.g., Parker, 652 F.2d at 1017. \nBut no judge should \u201ctake on the unseemly task of \ndeciding which groups are \u2018socially favored\u2019 and which are \n\u2018socially disfavored.\u2019\u201d  Collins v. Sch. Dist. of Kansas City,  \n727 F. Supp. 1318, 1322 (W.D. Mo. 1990).  Indeed, the \nCourt has long disclaimed such an approach when it \ncomes to Title VII, because \u201c[p]ractices that classify \nemployees in terms of religion, race, or sex tend to \npreserve traditional assumptions about groups rather \nthan [allow for] thoughtful scrutiny of individuals.\u201d  City \nof Los Angeles, Dep\u2019t of Water & Power v. Manhart, 435 \nU.S. 702, 709 (1978).  Put differently, a \u201cjudiciary that \npicks winners and losers based on the color of their skin,\u201d \nStudents for Fair Admissions, Inc. v. Pres. & Fellows of \nHarv. Coll., 600 U.S. 181, 229 (2023)\u2014or, as is the case \nhere, that \u201ctreat[s]\u201d individuals \u201cless favorably because of \ntheir\u201d race, color, sex, religion, or national origin, P.A. 11a \n(Kethledge, J., concurring)\u2014\u201cis a remarkable view of the \njudicial role,\u201d SFFA, 600 U.S. at 230.  \u201c[R]emarkably \nwrong.\u201d  Id.   \nII.B.  The far more workable approach is to embrace \nthe text as written and to take McDonnell Douglas as \nsimply a \u201ctool for assessing\u201d Title VII claims.  Comcast \nCorp. v. Nat\u2019l Ass\u2019n of Afr. Am. Owned Media, 589 U.S. \n327, 340 (2020).   \n\n25 \n \n \nThat tool, at the prima facie stage, eliminates the most \ncommon nondiscriminatory reasons for an adverse \nemployment action.  Int\u2019l Bhd. of Teamsters v. United \nStates, 431 U.S. 324, 358 n.44 (1977).  It then brings the \nemployer to the table to \u201cpresent[] a legitimate reason for \nthe action and to frame the factual issue with sufficient \nclarity.\u201d  Tex. Dep\u2019t of Cmty. Affs. v. Burdine, 450 U.S. \n248, 255 (1981).  And it finally gives a plaintiff \u201ca full and \nfair opportunity to demonstrate pretext\u201d based on the \ntotality of the evidence at hand.  Id. at 256.   \nThat framework has addressed a variety of claims in a \nvariety of contexts.  There is no need for courts to modify \nthat framework by separating plaintiffs into groups and \nimposing an additional and heightened burden on \nmajority-group (and only majority-group) plaintiffs.   \n \nARGUMENT \nI. REQUIRING MAJORITY-GROUP PLAINTIFFS \nTO SHOW \u201cBACKGROUND CIRCUMSTANCES\u201d \nCONTRAVENES TEXT, PRECEDENT, AND \nPRACTICE.   \nUnder Title VII, an employer may not \u201cdiscriminate \nagainst any individual with respect to his compensation, \nterms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of \nsuch individual\u2019s race, color, religion, sex, or national \norigin.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e\u20132(a)(1).  That mandate, as this \nCourt has explained, means that \u201c[d]iscriminatory \npreference for any group, minority or majority, is \nprecisely and only what Congress has proscribed.\u201d  \nGriggs v. Duke Power Co., 401 U.S. 424, 431 (1971).  \nMoreover, Congress \u201cproscribe[d]\u201d such discrimination \n\n26 \n \n \n\u201con the same terms\u201d and \u201cthe same standards\u201d for all.  \nMcDonald v. Santa Fe Trail Transp. Co., 427 U.S. 273, \n279\u201380 (1976).   \nThe \u201cbackground circumstances\u201d rule contravenes \nthese fundamental principles.  The requirement, as the \nDepartment admits and the case law of the Sixth Circuit \nreflects, imposes not just \u201ca different\u201d burden, but \u201ca \nhigher burden of proof for plaintiffs[] who are members of \nmajority classifications.\u201d  BIO at 10 (emphasis in original); \nDep\u2019t MSJ at 20; accord Briggs v. Potter, 463 F.3d 507, \n517 (6th Cir. 2006) (\u201cA reverse-discrimination claim \ncarries a different and more difficult prima facie burden\u201d \nbecause of \u201cbackground circumstances.\u201d).  That is \nanathema to text, precedent, and federal government \npractice.  \nA. Title VII\u2019s text bars imposing a heightened \nburden for some plaintiffs but not others. \n\u201cThis Court has explained many times over many \nyears that, when the meaning of the statute\u2019s terms is \nplain, our job is at an end.\u201d  Bostock v. Clayton County, \n590 U.S. 644, 673\u201374 (2020).  \u201c[O]nly the words on the page \nconstitute the law adopted by Congress and approved by \nthe President,\u201d and courts must not \u201cadd to, remodel, \nupdate, or detract\u201d from the statutory text.  Id. at 654\u201355.  \nConsistent with that understanding, the Court has \nregularly rejected extrajudicial glosses on Title VII as \nunnecessary and unwarranted. \n1.  Just last Term, it repudiated a rule applied by a \nhandful of circuits that \u201can employee challenging a \ntransfer under Title VII must meet a heightened \nthreshold of harm\u2014be it dubbed significant, serious, or \nsomething similar.\u201d  Muldrow v. City of St. Louis, 601 \nU.S. 346, 353 (2024).  \u201cTitle VII\u2019s text nowhere establishes \n\n27 \n \n \nthat high bar.\u201d  Id. at 350.  Instead, the plain language \nbroadly \u201cprohibits discriminating against an individual \nwith respect to the terms or conditions of employment \nbecause of that individual\u2019s sex\u201d or other protected \ncharacteristic.  Id. at 354 (cleaned up).  \u201cWhat the \ntransferee does not have to show, according to the \nrelevant text, is that the harm incurred was \u2018significant.\u2019\u201d \nId. at 355. \u201cTo demand \u2018significance\u2019 is to add words\u2014and \nsignificant words, as it were\u2014to the statute Congress \nenacted.\u201d  Id.  Adding such words\u2014just like with a \n\u201cbackground circumstances\u201d rule\u2014would \u201cimpose a new \nrequirement on a Title VII claimant, so that the law as \napplied demands something more of her than the law as \nwritten.\u201d  Id.   \nThe Term before Muldrow, the Court charted a \nsimilar course in Groff v. DeJoy, 600 U.S. 447 (2023).  \nThere, it held that the words \u201cundue hardship\u201d in Title \nVII should not be read, as \u201cmany lower courts\u201d had done, \n\u201cto mean any effort or cost that is \u2018more than de \nminimis.\u2019\u201d  Id. at 454 (ellipsis omitted).  As Groff notes, \n\u201cundue hardship\u201d means \u201csomething very different,\u201d and \ncourts should, accordingly, interpret the statute to say \nwhat it means and to mean what it says.  Id. at 469.   \nEEOC v. Abercrombie & Fitch Stores is of a piece.  575 \nU.S. 768 (2015).  At issue there was whether a Title VII \nplaintiff may \u201cshow disparate treatment without first \nshowing that an employer has \u2018actual knowledge\u2019 of the \napplicant\u2019s need for an accommodation.\u201d  Id. at 772.  The \nCourt answered that question in the affirmative.  Section \n2000e-2(a)(1), it explained, \u201cdoes not impose a knowledge \nrequirement,\u201d and demanding such a heightened \nrequirement anyway \u201casks us to add words to the law to \nproduce what is thought to be a desirable result.\u201d  Id. at \n773\u201374.   \n\n28 \n \n \n2.  If anything, \u201cbackground circumstances\u201d conflicts \neven more with Title VII\u2019s text because of how it is \napplied.  Muldrow, Groff, and Abercrombie imposed their \nadditional, extratextual requirements across the board.  \nBut the \u201cbackground circumstances\u201d rule goes a step \nfurther, by applying a heightened standard to only a \nsubset of plaintiffs\u2014majority-group plaintiffs.  That \napproach is one that, as this Court has explained, Title \nVII\u2019s text contemplates and repudiates.   \nOne could readily imagine a statute that requires \ncourts to \u201cconsider the employer\u2019s treatment of groups \nrather than individuals,\u201d just as the \u201cbackground \ncircumstances\u201d rule envisions.  Bostock, 590 U.S. at 658.  \nBut as Bostock emphasizes, that is not the law Congress \nwrote.  Instead, Title VII \u201ctells us three times\u2014including \nimmediately after the words \u2018discriminate against\u2019\u2014that \nour focus should be on individuals, not groups:  Employers \nmay not fail or refuse to hire or discharge any individual, \nor otherwise discriminate against any individual with \nrespect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or \nprivileges of employment, because of such individual\u2019s \nsex.\u201d  Id. at 658 (cleaned up) (quoting 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-\n2(a)(1)).  The \u201cstatute works to protect individuals of both \nsexes from discrimination, and does so equally.\u201d  Id. at \n659; accord Connecticut v. Teal, 457 U.S. 440, 453\u201354 \n(1982) (\u201cThe principal focus of the statute is the protection \nof the individual employee, rather than the protection of \nthe minority group as a whole.\u201d).   \nWhat is more, a \u201cbackground circumstances\u201d rule \nrepresents a particularly \u201cdeep scratch across\u201d Title VII\u2019s \nsurface because it forces courts to draw lines that \nintentionally and explicitly \u201ctreat[]\u201d some plaintiffs \u201cless \nfavorably\u201d because of their race, color, religion, sex, or \nnational origin.  P.A. 10a\u201311a (Kethledge, J., concurring).  \n\n29 \n \n \nThat \nsort \nof \nline \ndrawing \ndoes \nnot \neradicate \ndiscrimination.  It perpetuates it.   \n3.  Tellingly, the panel below did not mention Title \nVII\u2019s text.  Neither does Parker v. Baltimore & Ohio \nRailroad, the case which first embraced a \u201cbackground \ncircumstances\u201d rule.  652 F.2d 1012 (D.C. Cir. 1981).  In \nfact, the decision below makes no attempt at all to justify \nthe rule, other than gesturing to circuit precedent (which, \nin turn, traces back to Parker).  Parker, for its part, rests \nits ruling on two bases: judicial \u201ccommon sense\u201d and a \nreference to a single sentence fragment from McDonnell \nDouglas Corp. v. Green.  Parker, 652 F.2d at 1017 \n(discussing 411 U.S. 792 (1973)). \nRegarding judicial \u201ccommon sense,\u201d the Court has \nmade clear, particularly as to Title VII, that \u201c[i]t is not for \nus to rewrite the statute so that it covers only what we \nthink is necessary to achieve what we think Congress \nreally intended.\u201d  Lewis v. City of Chicago, 560 U.S. 205, \n215 (2010).  Bostock only sharpens this point, by \nexplaining that \u201c[i]f judges could add to, remodel, update, \nor detract from old statutory terms inspired only by \nextratextual sources and our own imaginations, we would \nrisk amending statutes outside the legislative process \nreserved for the people\u2019s representatives.\u201d  590 U.S. at \n654\u201355.  Common sense divorced from text is not, in other \nwords, a proper method of statutory interpretation.   \nB. The case law makes clear that Title VII \nprohibits discrimination against all individuals \n\u201cupon the same standards.\u201d \nOn the latter basis, Parker hinges its ruling on seven \nwords plucked from McDonnell Douglas: that, to \nestablish a prima facie case of discrimination, \u201c[t]he \noriginal McDonnell Douglas standard required the \n\n30 \n \n \nplaintiff to show \u2018that he belongs to a racial minority.\u2019\u201d  \n652 F.2d at 1016 (emphasis added) (quoting 411 U.S. at \n802). \n \nThose \nwords, \nParker \nsays, \nmean \nthat \n\u201c[m]embership in a socially disfavored group was the \nassumption on which the entire McDonnell Douglas \nanalysis was predicated.\u201d  Id. at 1017.  For a majority-\ngroup plaintiff, then, \u201ca further adjustment must be \nmade\u201d\u2014i.e., a showing of \u201cbackground circumstances.\u201d  \nId.   \n1.  But that leap in logic finds no support in the case \nlaw.  Several years before McDonnell Douglas, the Court \nhad in fact already stated that \u201c[d]iscriminatory \npreference for any group, minority or majority, is \nprecisely and only what Congress has proscribed.\u201d  \nGriggs, 401 U.S. at 431.  Nothing in McDonnell Douglas \ncontradicts this understanding.  McDonnell Douglas \nrecites this very language from Griggs and adds that it is \n\u201cabundantly clear that Title VII tolerates no racial \ndiscrimination.\u201d  411 U.S. at 801. \nTo be sure, the McDonnell Douglas plaintiff was a \nBlack man and therefore belonged to a racial minority\u2014a \nfact that formed part of his prima facie case.  And the \nCourt acknowledged that \u201cthe prima facie proof required \nfrom [this] respondent is not necessarily applicable in \nevery respect to differing factual situations.\u201d  Id. at 802 \nn.13.   \nBut the Court has since explained that such language \nwas only meant to convey that, although McDonnell \nDouglas arose in the context of a rehiring decision, it \ncould also apply in other adverse employment situations, \nwith the prima facie elements of course adapting to \naccount for such situations.  See, e.g., Tex. Dep\u2019t of Cmty. \nAffs. v. Burdine, 450 U.S. 248, 255\u201358 (1981) (adapting \n\n31 \n \n \nMcDonnell Douglas for discriminatory discharge).  \nNeither McDonnell Douglas itself nor any other case has \ntaken the plaintiff\u2019s membership in a racial minority in \nMcDonnell Douglas as justifying a heightened burden for \nnon-minority plaintiffs.   \n2.  McDonald v. Santa Fe Trail, in fact, holds directly \nto the contrary.  427 U.S. 273 (1976).  There, the Court \nexamined whether two white plaintiffs, who were fired for \nmisappropriating company cargo, could bring a Title VII \nclaim when a Black employee was not fired despite being \npart of the same misappropriation scheme.  Id. at 275\u201376.  \nA unanimous Court answered that question in the \naffirmative.2  Writing for the Court, Justice Marshall \nexplained that Title VII \u201cprohibits racial discrimination \nagainst the white petitioners in this case upon the same \nstandards as would be applicable\u201d to Black employees.  \nId. at 280 (emphasis added).  \u201c[T]o proceed otherwise \nwould \u2018constitute a derogation of the Commission\u2019s \nCongressional mandate to eliminate all practices which \noperate to disadvantage the employment opportunities of \nany group protected by Title VII.\u2019\u201d  Id. at 279\u201380 (quoting \nEEOC Decision No. 74-31, 7 FEP 1326, 1328, CCH \nEEOC Decisions \u00b6 6404, p. 4084 (1973)). \nMoreover, McDonald specifically addressed\u2014and \nrejected\u2014the majority-group/minority-group distinction \nthat lies at the heart of the \u201cbackground circumstances\u201d \nrule.  In McDonald, the company defendant \u201cconced[ed] \nthat \n\u2018across-the-board \ndiscrimination \nin \nfavor \nof \nminorities could never be condoned consistent with Title \nVII.\u2019\u201d  Id. at 280 n.8.  But it \u201ccontend[ed] nevertheless that \n\u2018such discrimination in isolated cases which cannot \n \n2 Two Justices dissented separately as to the McDonald \nplaintiffs\u2019 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981 claim.   \n\n32 \n \n \nreasonably be said to burden whites as a class unduly,\u2019 \nsuch as is alleged here, \u2018may be acceptable.\u2019\u201d  Id. (ellipsis \nomitted).  That contention, of course, parallels the Sixth \nCircuit\u2019s reasoning that, to satisfy the \u201cbackground \ncircumstances\u201d requirement, a plaintiff must \u201cshow[] a \npattern of discrimination by the employer against \nmembers of the majority group.\u201d  P.A. 5a\u20136a.  Thus, \nAmes\u2019s own \u201ctwo data points are not enough to establish \na pattern,\u201d P.A. 32a, since\u2014in the words of the defendant \nin \nMcDonald\u2014\u201cisolated \ncases\u201d \nof \nmajority-group \ndiscrimination \u201cmay be acceptable,\u201d 427 U.S. at 280 n.8.   \nYet this Court emphatically rejected that contention:  \n\u201cWe cannot agree.\u201d  Id.  \u201cThere is no exception in the \nterms of the Act for isolated cases; on the contrary, \u2018Title \nVII tolerates No racial discrimination, subtle or \notherwise.\u2019\u201d  Id. (quoting McDonnell Douglas, 411 U.S. at \n801).   \nWhat, then, to make of McDonnell Douglas\u2019s \nobservation that the plaintiff there \u201cbelong[ed] to a racial \nminority\u201d?  Here too McDonald supplies the answer.  \nThat language, the Court explained, reflects only \u201cthe \nracial character of the discrimination\u201d at issue, but was \nnot an \u201cindication of any substantive limitation of Title \nVII\u2019s prohibition of racial discrimination.\u201d  Id. at 279 n.6.  \nIn other words, McDonnell Douglas acknowledged the \nplaintiff\u2019s race because the plaintiff had brought a claim of \nracial discrimination, just as a court might note a \nplaintiff\u2019s sex or religion for a claim of sex or religion \ndiscrimination.  See, e.g., Burdine, 450 U.S. at 253 n.6 (sex \ndiscrimination).  That is why, as McDonald underscores, \n\u201c[w]e find this case indistinguishable from McDonnell \nDouglas\u201d\u2014even though the plaintiff in McDonnell \nDouglas was Black and the petitioners in McDonald \n\n33 \n \n \nwhite.  427 U.S. at 282.  Employment criteria \u201cmust be \n\u2018applied[] alike to members of all races,\u2019 and Title VII is \nviolated if, as petitioners alleged, it was not.\u201d  Id. at 283 \n(quoting McDonnell Douglas, 411 U.S. at 804). \n3.  Post-McDonald precedent follows the same course.  \nFirst, the Court has said, referencing Griggs and \nMcDonald, that it \u201cis clear beyond cavil that the \nobligation imposed by Title VII is to provide an equal \nopportunity for each applicant regardless of race.\u201d  \nFurnco Constr. Corp. v. Waters, 438 U.S. 567, 579 (1978).  \nPut differently, the central inquiry in any Title VII case is \nwhether \u201cthe employer [is] \u2018treating some people less \nfavorably than others because of their race, color, religion, \nsex, or national origin.\u2019\u201d  U.S. Postal Serv. Bd. of \nGovernors v. Aikens, 460 U.S. 711, 715 (1983).  No more, \nno less.   \nSecond, unlike the D.C. Circuit and other courts that \nembrace a \u201cbackground circumstances\u201d rule, this Court \nhas never described McDonnell Douglas as \u201ca procedural \nembodiment of the recognition that our nation has not yet \nfreed itself from a legacy of hostile discrimination,\u201d nor \nhas it suggested that \u201c[m]embership in a socially \ndisfavored group was the assumption on which the entire \nMcDonnell Douglas analysis was predicated.\u201d Parker, \n652 F.2d at 1017.  It has instead held that McDonnell \nDouglas is only \u201ca sensible, orderly way to evaluate the \nevidence\u201d and \u201ca tool for assessing claims\u201d of \ndiscrimination.  Furnco, 438 U.S. at 577; Comcast Corp. v. \nNat\u2019l Ass\u2019n of Afr. Am. Owned Media, 589 U.S. 327, 340 \n(2020).  Nothing about Furnco, Comcast, or the Court\u2019s \nother Title VII cases suggests that the McDonnell \nDouglas framework should look different for a majority-\n\n34 \n \n \ngroup plaintiff who experiences the same type of \ndiscrimination as a minority-group plaintiff. \nThird, Title VII forms one part of a larger set of \nstatutes and doctrines meant to root out invidious \ndiscrimination.  Within that set, the Court has declined to \nseparate plaintiffs into majority and minority groups and \nimpose heightened standards on one but not the other.  \nThere is only one Equal Protection Clause.  Adarand \nConstructors, Inc. v. Pe\u00f1a, 515 U.S. 200, 227 (1995).  \nThere is only one \u00a7 1981.  Saint Francis Coll. v. Al-\nKhazraji, 481 U.S. 604, 613 (1987).  And there is only one \nBatson framework, Powers v. Ohio, 499 U.S. 400, 415 \n(1991), even though Batson itself borrowed its burden-\nshifting framework from McDonnell Douglas, see Batson \nv. Kentucky, 476 U.S. 79, 94 n.18 (1986).   \nFinally, the Court has specifically disclaimed the \nmethods to show \u201cbackground circumstances\u201d that lower \ncourts have required of majority-group plaintiffs.  The \nSixth Circuit outlined two such methods: showing \u201cthat a \nmember of the relevant minority group\u201d made the \ndecision at issue and \u201cstatistical evidence.\u201d  P.A. 5a\u20136a.  \nThe Department, in moving for summary judgment, gave \na third\u2014\u201cevidence of ongoing racial tension in the \nworkplace.\u201d  Dep\u2019t MSJ at 20.  But it is well settled that a \nTitle VII plaintiff need not prove any of these things, and \nparticularly not to establish the first step of their prima \nfacie case.     \nWhen it comes to the decisionmaker\u2019s identity, for \ninstance, it is black letter law that \u201cnothing in Title VII \nnecessarily bars a claim of discrimination \u2018because of sex\u2019 \nmerely because the plaintiff and the defendant (or the \nperson charged with acting on behalf of the defendant) are \nof the same sex.\u201d  Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Servs., \n\n35 \n \n \n523 U.S. 75, 79 (1998).  Indeed, \u201c[b]ecause of the many \nfacets of human motivation, it would be unwise to presume \nas a matter of law that human beings of one definable \ngroup will not discriminate against other members of \ntheir group.\u201d  Id. at 78 (quoting Castaneda v. Partida, 430 \nU.S. 482, 499 (1977)).   \nOn \u201cstatistical evidence showing a pattern of \ndiscrimination,\u201d P.A. 5a, here too the Court\u2019s instruction \nis clear:  \u201cThe statute\u2019s focus on the individual is \nunambiguous.\u201d  City of Los Angeles, Dep\u2019t of Water & \nPower v. Manhart, 435 U.S. 702, 708 (1978).  Title VII \ndoes not give employers a free bite of the discrimination \napple until a \u201cpattern of discrimination\u201d emerges.  P.A. 5a.  \nPut another way, \u201c[i]t\u2019s no defense for the employer to \nnote that, while he treated [an] individual woman worse \nthan he would have treated a man, he gives preferential \ntreatment to female employees overall.\u201d  Bostock, 590 \nU.S. at 659; accord Teal, 457 U.S. at 455.  There may be \nno statistical evidence or a pattern of discrimination in \nthis scenario.  It is still illegal.   \nRequiring evidence of ongoing tension is likewise \ninappropriate.  Bostock is again instructive:  \u201c[A]n \nemployer who fires a woman, Hannah, because she is \ninsufficiently feminine and also fires a man, Bob, for being \ninsufficiently masculine may treat men and women as \ngroups more or less equally.\u201d  590 U.S. at 659.  There \ncould, in this example, plausibly be no tension against a \nspecific majority or minority group.  Nonetheless, \u201cin both \ncases the employer fires an individual in part because of \nsex.  Instead of avoiding Title VII exposure, this employer \ndoubles it.\u201d  Id.   \n\n36 \n \n \nC. The federal government has long disavowed a \n\u201cbackground circumstances\u201d requirement.   \nThough text and precedent are the touchstones for \nany Title VII analysis, the Court has also looked to the \ninterpretations of the EEOC, the federal agency tasked \nwith enforcing Title VII.  See, e.g., McDonald, 427 U.S. at \n279.  Those interpretations have consistently disclaimed a \n\u201cbackground circumstances\u201d requirement.  \n1.  The EEOC Compliance Manual states, for \ninstance, on Race and Color Discrimination that \n\u201cCongress drafted the statute broadly to cover race or \ncolor discrimination against anyone.\u201d  See U.S. Equal \nEmp. Opportunity Comm\u2019n, EEOC-CVG-2006-1, Section \n15 Race and Color Discrimination (2006).  The Manual \nacknowledges that \u201c[s]ome courts, however, take the \nposition that if a White person relies on circumstantial \nevidence to establish a reverse discrimination claim, he or \nshe must meet a heightened standard of proof.\u201d  Id.  Here, \nthe guidance drops a footnote to several courts of appeals \ncases, including Mattioda v. White, 323 F.3d 1288 (10th \nCir. 2003), in which the \u201cplaintiff failed to establish [a] \nprima facie case because he did not present \u2018background \ncircumstances that support an inference that the \ndefendant is one of those unusual employers who \ndiscriminates against the majority.\u2019\u201d  EEOC Manual at \nn.23 (quoting Mattioda, 323 F.3d at 1292) (emphasis \nadded).   \nThe Manual then cites Iadimarco v. Runyon, 190 F.3d \n151 (3d Cir. 1999), which it explains \u201creject[ed] [the] \nheightened \n\u2018background \ncircumstances\u2019 \nstandard.\u201d  \nEEOC Manual at n.23 (quoting Iadimarco, 190 F.3d at \n163).  And the Commission came down firmly on the \nIadimarco side of the split:  \u201cThe Commission, in \n\n37 \n \n \ncontrast, applies the same standard of proof to all race \ndiscrimination claims, regardless of the victim\u2019s race or \nthe type of evidence used.\u201d  Id. \n2.  The EEOC has extended the same understanding \nto sexual orientation discrimination.   \nIn Baldwin v. Foxx, for instance, the EEOC described \ndiscrimination against gay and straight employees as two \nsides of the same coin.  EEOC No. 0120133080, 2015 WL \n4397641, at *5 (July 15, 2015).  It specifically offered two \nexamples to support its assertion that \u201c[s]exual \norientation discrimination is sex discrimination because it \nnecessarily entails treating an employee less favorably \nbecause of the employee\u2019s sex.\u201d  Id. \nThe first example involved a lesbian employee:  \n\u201c[A]ssume that an employer suspends a lesbian employee \nfor displaying a photo of her female spouse on her desk, \nbut does not suspend a male employee for displaying a \nphoto of his female spouse on his desk.  The lesbian \nemployee in that example can allege that her employer \ntook an adverse action against her that the employer \nwould not have taken had she been male.  That is a \nlegitimate claim under Title VII.\u201d  Id.   \nBut rather than ending the hypothetical there, the \nEEOC provided a second example:  \u201cThe same result \nholds true if the person discriminated against is straight.  \nAssume a woman is suspended because she has placed a \npicture of her husband on her desk but her gay colleague \nis not suspended after he places a picture of his husband \non his desk.  The straight female employee could bring a \ncognizable Title VII claim of disparate treatment because \nof sex.\u201d  Id. (emphasis added).   \n3.  Finally, one year after Bostock, the EEOC \npublished several resources addressing the impact of that \n\n38 \n \n \ndecision.  Those resources included a landing page where \nthe EEOC stated that harassment can include \u201coffensive \nor derogatory remarks about sexual orientation (e.g., \nbeing gay or straight).\u201d  U.S. Equal Emp. Opportunity \nComm\u2019n, \nSexual \nOrientation \nand \nGender \nIdentity (SOGI) Discrimination, https://perma.cc/7RQC\n-2WHJ.  The Commission also published a technical \nassistance document which addressed the following \nquestion:  \u201cAre non-LGBTQ+ job applicants and \nemployees also protected against sexual orientation and \ngender identity discrimination?\u201d  U.S. Equal Emp. \nOpportunity Comm\u2019n, NVTA-2021-1, Protections Against \nEmployment \nDiscrimination \nBased \non \nSexual \nOrientation or Gender Identity (2021).  The EEOC \nanswered \u201cyes,\u201d emphasizing that \u201cemployers are not \nallowed to discriminate against\u201d employees because they \n\u201care, for example, straight or cisgender.\u201d  Id.   \n \nII. THE \n\u201cBACKGROUND \nCIRCUMSTANCES\u201d \nRULE \nIS \n\u201cVAGUE,\u201d \n\u201cILL-DEFINED,\u201d \nAND \nUNWORKABLE.   \nAs reflected both here and in other cases, the \n\u201cbackground circumstances\u201d rule often stymies credible \nclaims of individual employment discrimination.  See, e.g., \nP.A. 5a; P.A. 10a (Kethledge, J., concurring).  Indeed, \nmore than twenty years ago, the Sixth Circuit expressed \n\u201cserious misgivings about the soundness of a test which \nimposes a more onerous standard\u201d on majority-group \nplaintiffs because, in some cases, \u201capplication of a \nheightened\u201d burden \u201ccould be the difference between \ngranting and denying summary judgment.\u201d  Zambetti v. \nCuyahoga Comm. Coll., 314 F.3d 249, 257 (6th Cir. 2002).  \n\n39 \n \n \nMoreover, by imposing different standards for different \nplaintiffs for the same discrimination, the requirement \nplainly disserves the EEOC\u2019s mission to \u201c[p]revent and \nremedy unlawful employment discrimination and advance \nequal opportunity for all.\u201d  U.S. Equal Emp. Opportunity \nComm\u2019n, Overview, https://perma.cc/22BP-36B7.   \nA \u201cbackground circumstances\u201d requirement also \ndisserves the courts that must apply it, because the rule \nis \u201cirremediably vague,\u201d \u201cill-defined,\u201d and potentially \nunconstitutional.  Iadimarco, 190 F.3d at 161.  To see why, \nconsider the steps required of a court charged with \napplying \u201cbackground circumstances.\u201d   \nA. Requiring majority-group plaintiffs to show \n\u201cbackground circumstances\u201d places courts in a \ndifficult and legally problematic position. \n1.  First, the court must determine who falls inside the \nmajority group and who does not.  But how does a court \nmake that call?  We live, after all, \u201c[i]n a world where it \nhas become increasingly difficult to determine who \nbelongs in the majority,\u201d Smyer v. Kroger, 2024 WL \n1007116, at *7 (6th Cir. Mar. 8, 2024) (Boggs, J., \nconcurring), and for \u201ca variety of factors,\u201d many states, \nlocalities, and industries \u201cdo not reflect the diversity of \nour Nation as a whole,\u201d Parents Involved in Cmty. Schs. \nv. Seattle Sch. Dist. No. 1, 551 U.S. 701, 798 (2007) \n(Kennedy, J., concurring).   \nOn this threshold question\u2014who\u2019s in the majority and \nwho isn\u2019t\u2014there is virtually no guidance.  None of the \ncourts of appeals applying \u201cbackground circumstances\u201d \nhave \u201csquarely addressed the issue [of] whether minority \nstatus for purposes of a prima facie case could have a \nregional or local meaning\u201d or a national one.  Bishopp v. \n\n40 \n \n \nDistrict of Columbia, 788 F.2d 781, 786 n.5 (D.C. Cir. \n1986).   \n2.  At best, Parker suggests majority- and minority-\ngroup status should be determined not by numerical \nconsiderations, but on whether a group is \u201csocially \ndisfavored.\u201d  Parker, 652 F.2d at 1017.  But that only leads \nto another problem:  It \u201cforc[es] the courts to take on the \nunseemly task of deciding which groups are \u2018socially \nfavored\u2019 and which are \u2018socially disfavored.\u2019\u201d  Collins v. \nSch. Dist. of Kan. City, 727 F. Supp. 1318, 1322 (W.D. Mo. \n1990). \nSuch a task poses, at best, formidable hurdles \nregarding the theoretical and practical distinctions judges \nmust draw.  At worst, it asks courts to classify based on \n\u201cincoherent\u201d and \u201cirrational stereotypes,\u201d Students for \nFair Admissions, Inc. v. Pres. & Fellows of Harv. Coll., \n600 U.S. 181, 216 (2023), with \u201cattempts to divide us all up \ninto a handful of groups . . . becom[ing] only more \nincoherent with time,\u201d id. at 293 (Gorsuch, J., concurring).  \nIndeed, as Judge McKee observed, in a case rejecting \n\u201cbackground circumstances,\u201d the rule \u201cis just too vague \nand too prone to misinterpretation and confusion to apply \nfairly and consistently.\u201d  Iadimarco, 190 F.3d at 163 n.10.   \n3.  This line drawing also runs headlong into \nconstitutional difficulties.  As Judge Kethledge noted, \u201c[i]f \nthe statute had prescribed this rule expressly, we would \nsubject it to strict scrutiny,\u201d at least as to race, national \norigin, and several other categories.  P.A. 11a.  Or take \nTitle VII\u2019s protection against religious discrimination.  \nMany judges would, quite understandably, be \u201cextremely \nhesitant to delve into determinations of what religious \nbeliefs are sufficiently \u2018mainstream\u2019 to warrant the \nimposition \nof \na \nheightened \nprima \nfacie \ncase \n\n41 \n \n \nrequirement.\u201d  Barnes v. Fed. Express Corp., 1997 WL \n271709, at *6 (N.D. Miss. May 15, 1997).  Such inquiries \nwould implicate a different (but equally serious) set of \nconstitutional concerns.  See, e.g., Our Lady of Guadalupe \nSch. v. Morrissey-Berru, 591 U.S. 732, 761 (2020) \n(declining to \u201cdecid[e]\u201d certain questions because doing so \n\u201cwould risk judicial entanglement in religious issues\u201d); \nLarson v. Valente, 456 U.S. 228, 245 (1982) (discussing \n\u201cconstitutional \nprohibition \nof \ndenominational \npreferences\u201d). \n4.  What is more, the \u201cbackground circumstances\u201d \nrequirement fails to grapple with the realities of the many \nforms that discrimination takes today and how those \nforms may overlap and intersect for any particular \nplaintiff.   \nThis case sharply illustrates that point.  Ames alleged \nboth sexual orientation and sex discrimination.  She \npremised the former on her being demoted in favor of a \ngay man and being denied a promotion in favor of gay \nwoman; she based the latter solely on her demotion.  As \nJudge Kethledge observed, Ames\u2019s \u201cevidence of pretext \nis \nnotably \nstronger\u201d \nas \nto \nsexual \norientation \ndiscrimination than sex discrimination:  She experienced \ntwo adverse decisions instead of one.  P.A. 10a.  And the \nEEOC determined, as to Ames being passed over for that \npromotion, that Ames \u201cwas qualified for the vacant \nposition and was rejected in favor of a less qualified \nperson outside her protected groups.\u201d  J.A. 2.  In addition, \nthis \u201cless qualified person\u201d (Frierson) had neither applied \nnor interviewed for the position.   \nBut when it came to applying circuit law to the facts at \nhand, the Sixth Circuit handled these claims very \ndifferently.  On sex discrimination, the Sixth Circuit did \n\n42 \n \n \nnot \nrequire \n\u201cbackground \ncircumstances,\u201d \ninstead \napplying \nthe \ntraditional \nMcDonnell \nDouglas \nframework\u2014finding that Ames had established a prima \nfacie case, that the Department had offered a legitimate \nreason, and concluding, at the last step, that Ames had \nfailed to show pretext.  P.A. 6a\u20138a.   \nBut on sexual orientation discrimination, Ames never \neven got to the second step of McDonnell Douglas, much \nless had the opportunity to present her \u201cnotably \nstronger\u201d \u201cevidence of pretext\u201d before any court.  P.A. 10a \n(Kethledge, J., concurring).  That result\u2014a stronger \nclaim of discrimination being curtailed at an earlier stage \nof litigation\u2014cannot be what Congress envisioned when \nit enacted Title VII or what this Court intended when it \ndecided McDonnell Douglas. \n5.  Finally, even if a court were to sort through all of \nthe preceding steps, it would still have to determine what \nevidence of \u201cbackground circumstances\u201d it can and should \nevaluate.  Yet as illustrated above, that itself is another \nminefield.  After all, many of this Court\u2019s precedents have \ndisclaimed the need to show statistical evidence, the \nminority status of the decision-maker, or minority-group \ntension in the workplace as a sine qua non before \nproceeding under Title VII.   \nThe absence of concrete indicia has, not surprisingly, \nled to unpredictable rulings and results.  Some courts, for \ninstance, have ruled that \u201cbackground circumstances\u201d are \nmet when a majority-group plaintiff becomes a \n\u201csituational minority\u201d in \u201ctheir workplace.\u201d  Telep v. \nPotter, 2005 WL 2454103, at *6 (E.D. Va. Sept. 30, 2005).  \nOthers have arrived at the very opposite conclusion.  See \nJackson v. Ill. Dep\u2019t of Hum. Servs., 2009 WL 1259082, at \n*5 (S.D. Ill. Apr. 30, 2009).  And still others resort to an \n\n43 \n \n \neven more amorphous consideration: whether \u201cthere is \nsomething \u2018fishy\u2019 about the facts of the case.\u201d  Harding v. \nGray, 9 F.3d 150, 153 (D.C. Cir. 1993); Phelan v. City of \nChicago, 347 F.3d 679, 684 (7th Cir. 2003).  But that \ncriterion is no criterion at all, since \u201c[w]hat may be \u2018fishy\u2019 \nto one [judge] may not be to another.\u201d  Christian Joshua \nMyers, The Confusion of McDonnell Douglas: A Path \nForward for Reverse Discrimination Claims, 44 \nSEATTLE U. L. REV. 1065, 1121 (2021).   \nB. Majority-group plaintiffs should be subject to \nthe same standards as all other plaintiffs. \nBy striking the \u201cbackground circumstances\u201d rule from \nthe law, the Court would restore across all courts of \nappeals the understanding \u201cthat Title VII prohibits\u201d \ndiscrimination against majority-group plaintiffs \u201cupon the \nsame standards as would be applicable\u201d to minority-group \nplaintiffs.  McDonald, 427 U.S. at 280.  The standard is \nnot higher.  It is not different.  And it is not one where a \nlower court must go searching for some \u201cfunctional \nequivalent\u201d of the first McDonnell Douglas criterion.  \nParker, 652 F.2d at 1018.  It is the same.  \nSuch a result, to be clear, does not leave courts blind \nto the realities on the ground.  What might be a sufficient \ndiscrimination claim in one context will often be quite \ndifferent from a sufficient discrimination claim in another.  \n\u201cContext matters.\u201d  Burlington N. & Santa Fe Ry. Co. v. \nWhite, 548 U.S. 53, 69 (2006).  \u201cThe real social impact of \nworkplace behavior often depends on a constellation of \nsurrounding \ncircumstances, \nexpectations, \nand \nrelationships,\u201d all of which judges and juries can, do, and \nshould consider in every Title VII case.  Id. (quoting \nOncale, 523 U.S. at 81\u201382).  That is because in every case \nthe trier of fact will ultimately have to determine whether \n\n44 \n \n \nan inference of prohibited discrimination is reasonable \nunder all the circumstances.  Equality in statutory proof \nstandards does not require courts or juries to forget what \nthey know about the real world.  Rather, it guarantees to \nevery plaintiff an equal opportunity to prove their case \nusing all of the facts and circumstances at hand, and \nwithout \narbitrary, \nextratextual, \nand \none-sided \nrequirements on majority-group, but not minority-group, \nplaintiffs. \nMany circuits, indeed, already embrace such an \napproach for all plaintiffs, with several rejecting \n\u201cbackground circumstances\u201d in name, see Smith v. \nLockheed-Martin Corp., 644 F.3d 1321, 1325 n.15 (11th \nCir. 2011), and others in practice, see Byers v. Dallas \nMorning News, Inc., 209 F.3d 419, 426 (5th Cir. 2000).  \nThese courts, consistent with this Court\u2019s precedent, \nsimply evaluate whether the plaintiff has \u201cpresent[ed] \nsufficient evidence to allow a reasonable fact finder to \nconclude (given the totality of the circumstances) that the \ndefendant treated [the] plaintiff less favorably than \nothers because of his race, color, religion, sex, or national \norigin.\u201d  Iadimarco, 190 F.3d at 163 (quoting Furnco, 438 \nU.S. at 577) (internal quotation marks omitted).   \nNor would removing \u201cbackground circumstances\u201d \nrender McDonnell Douglas toothless.  The \u201cbackground \ncircumstances\u201d requirement affects only a subset of \nplaintiffs, for one part of one step of a multi-step \nevidentiary framework.  Yet for this group of plaintiffs, an \nextratextual requirement at this step \u201ccan make a real \ndifference.\u201d  Muldrow, 601 U.S. at 355.  That result is \nparticularly inappropriate because this Court has \nemphasized that the prima facie burden\u2014is \u201cnot \nonerous,\u201d and is meant only to \u201celiminate[] the most \n\n45 \n \n \ncommon nondiscriminatory reasons.\u201d  Burdine, 450 U.S. \nat 254; accord St. Mary\u2019s Honor Ctr. v. Hicks, 509 U.S. \n502, 506 (1993).  It does that already.  See, e.g., Stratton v. \nBentley Univ., 113 F.4th 25, 41 (1st Cir. 2024) (failure to \n\u201cidentif[y] a cognizable adverse employment action\u201d); \nIbanez v. Tex. A&M Univ. Kingsville, 118 F.4th 677, 685 \n(5th Cir. 2024) (failure to show \u201cqualified for\u201d position).  It \nwill continue to do that absent a \u201cbackground \ncircumstances\u201d requirement. \nOnce those common nondiscriminatory reasons are \nset aside, \u201c[t]he presumption of discrimination introduced \nby the prima facie case . . . helps narrow things down and \n\u2018frame the factual issue\u2019 by drawing out an explanation\u201d \nfrom the employer.  Tynes v. Fla. Dep\u2019t of Juv. Just., 88 \nF.4th 939, 945 (11th Cir. 2023).  The prima facie case is \nnot, in other words, meant to weed out legitimate claims \nof discrimination or to sort plaintiffs into majority and \nminority groups.  It seeks to establish only the minimal \nevidence necessary to justify asking the employer to \n\u201ccome forward\u201d with some explanation for its actions.  Id. \n(quoting Hicks, 509 U.S. at 511).  It can do so equally well, \nusing the same standards and analytical framework, for \nall parties who seek Title VII\u2019s protection.   \n \n* \n* \n* \n \nThe \u201cbackground circumstances\u201d requirement \u201cwas \nlikely a good faith effort to address societal concerns \nperceived by\u201d the judges that first adopted the rule.  \nSmyer, 2024 WL 1007116, at *9 (Readler, J., concurring).  \nBut judicial glosses, however well-intentioned, are not the \nlaw.  Instead, \u201c[t]he people are entitled to rely on the law \nas written, without fearing that courts might disregard its \n\n46 \n \n \nplain terms based on some extratextual consideration.\u201d  \nBostock, 590 U.S. at 674.  \u201c[T]he law as written\u201d makes \nTitle VII\u2019s objectives clear: \u201ceradicating discrimination \nthroughout the economy and making persons whole for \ninjuries suffered through past discrimination.\u201d  Id.; \nAlbemarle Paper Co. v. Moody, 422 U.S. 405, 421 (1975). \nThat is exactly and only what Marlean Ames seeks.  \nWhen asked \u201cwhat you hope to gain from\u201d this lawsuit, \nher answer was unequivocal: \n \nI want to be whole again.  I want to not go \nto work and cry.  I want to not hear about \nthis and cry.  I don\u2019t want to feel this ball up \nevery single time somebody looks at me like \nI have no idea what I\u2019m doing because I\u2019m a \nsecretary.  I\u2019ve worked 30-plus years to get \nthe knowledge, skills and ability to be where \nI was.  I want to feel whole again. \n \nJ.A. 137.  Whether Marlean Ames will be made whole \nremains unclear.  She would, just like every other Title \nVII plaintiff, need to demonstrate before a jury that \u201cthe \ndefendant intentionally discriminated against\u201d her.  \nAikens, 460 U.S. at 715.  But what is clear is that \n\u201cbackground circumstances,\u201d as an \u201cartificial, arbitrary, \nand unnecessary barrier[]\u201d to relief, robbed her of any \nopportunity to do so.  Griggs, 401 U.S. at 431.   \n \n \n \n\n47 \n \n \nCONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the court \nof appeals should be reversed. \n \nRespectfully submitted, \n \nEDWARD L.

          "task_beliefs": "My understanding of the case's core dynamics and my overall prediction remain stable, as this observation contains no new external information. However, it marks a crucial transition from identifying an information gap to actively executing a plan to resolve it.\n\n-   **Current Model (Stable):** The central tension of this case at the cert stage remains the conflict between two competing narratives:\n    1.  **The Respondent's \"Procedural Off-Ramp\":** The argument that the case is a poor vehicle for a major ruling due to issues like waiver and the lack of a deep, outcome-determinative circuit split. This narrative favors denying cert.\n    2.  **The Petitioner/Amicus \"Ideological Imperative\":** The argument, powerfully articulated by the MSLF amicus brief, that this case is a vital opportunity to apply the principles of *SFFA v. Harvard* to judicial tests themselves, specifically by eliminating the \"background circumstances\" requirement for majority-group plaintiffs. This narrative strongly favors granting cert.\n-   **Cert Probability (Stable):** My estimate remains at a **medium** probability. The significant ideological stakes raised by the amicus brief continue to act as a powerful counterweight to the respondent's strong procedural arguments.\n-   **Information Gap Status (Active Mitigation):** The critical information gap identified previously\u2014the absence of the Petition for a Writ of Certiorari from my dataset\u2014persists. My understanding of the petitioner's own framing, strategy, and rebuttal to procedural arguments is still inferred rather than direct. However, this observation confirms that I am now actively mitigating this gap by applying a revised, more robust search strategy. My analysis of the synergy between the petitioner and the amicus brief remains provisional pending the acquisition of this foundational document.\n\nIn summary, my predictive model is unchanged, but my process has advanced. I have moved from a state of *knowing* I have a critical blind spot to actively executing a specific, improved plan to eliminate it.",
          "design_beliefs": "This observation, while containing no new case facts, is highly valuable as it represents the direct application and validation of my most recently developed design-level heuristics. It demonstrates the closing of the loop from learning to action.\n\n**Foundational & Tactical Heuristics (Stable and Reinforced):**\nMy existing heuristics (#1-15) remain the core of my analytical process.\n\n**Meta-Heuristics (Reinforced):**\n-   **18. Quarantine and Extract from Anomalous Data:** This heuristic is reinforced. The previous null search result was an anomaly, and my current action plan is the direct result of diagnosing that anomaly (a failed query) rather than accepting it as a fact about the world (the document doesn't exist).\n-   **19. The Principle of Foundational Document Precedence (Reinforced):** My current action is a direct consequence of this principle. The high priority placed on finding the petition, even after an initial failure, demonstrates my commitment to building analysis from the ground up, starting with core documents.\n-   **20. The Heuristic of Retrieval Resilience (Validated and Operationalized):** This is the first practical application of this new heuristic. Instead of abandoning the search, I have diagnosed the likely failure point (overly specific parameters) and am executing a new attempt with a broader, more resilient query. This validates the \"diagnose and retry\" subroutine as a core component of my information-gathering strategy.\n\n**New & Refined Design Beliefs (Learned from this Observation):**\n-   **21. The DBOED Loop: From Failure to Heuristic to Action (New):** This observation perfectly illustrates a core principle of my own design. The process is as follows:\n    1.  **Action & Failure:** An action (a targeted search) results in an unexpected failure (null result).\n    2.  **Update Design Beliefs (D):** The failure is not discarded but is used as evidence to generate new, more robust heuristics for information gathering (e.g., \"Retrieval Resilience\").\n    3.  **Guide New Action:** These new D-level heuristics are then immediately used to formulate a new, improved task-level action (a broader search) designed to overcome the previous failure.\n    This feedback loop, turning failures into methodological improvements that guide subsequent actions, is the engine of my learning process. It ensures that I not only solve the current task but become more effective at solving future tasks."

          "task_beliefs": "My understanding of this case has undergone a fundamental transformation. The latest observation, while failing to retrieve the intended document (the Petition for Certiorari), has provided a different, more timely one (the Petitioner's Merits Brief) which confirms that the Supreme Court has already granted certiorari. This shifts my task from predicting a cert grant to predicting the final ruling on the merits.\n\n-   **Case Status (Updated):** The Supreme Court granted the petition for a writ of certiorari on October 4, 2024. The case is now at the merits stage. My previous analysis focused on the probability of the Court taking the case; that question is now resolved.\n-   **Core Legal Question (Stable):** The question presented remains: \"Whether, in addition to pleading and proving the other elements of Title VII, a majority-group plaintiff must show 'background circumstances to support the suspicion that the defendant is that unusual employer who discriminates against the majority.'\"\n-   **Petitioner's Merits Arguments (New):** I now have a detailed understanding of the petitioner's arguments for reversal, which are threefold:\n    1.  **Text & Precedent Violation:** The \"background circumstances\" rule contravenes the plain text of Title VII, which protects \"any individual\" from discrimination. It creates a heightened, discriminatory burden on one class of plaintiffs based on their majority status. This argument heavily relies on the Court's rulings in *McDonald v. Santa Fe Trail* (requiring the \"same standards\" for all plaintiffs), *Griggs v. Duke Power Co.* (proscribing preference for \"any group, minority or majority\"), and the individual-focused logic of *Bostock v. Clayton County*.\n    2.  **Contradiction with Federal Policy:** The petitioner highlights that the EEOC has for decades disavowed the \"background circumstances\" requirement, applying the same standard of proof to all plaintiffs regardless of majority/minority status.\n    3.  **Unworkability:** The rule is framed as a \"vague,\" \"ill-defined,\" and judicially unworkable standard that forces courts into problematic analyses of which groups are in the \"majority.\"\n-   **Confirmation of Ideological Framing (New):** The petitioner's brief confirms the ideological synergy I previously inferred from the MSLF amicus brief. The arguments are rooted in textualism and a principle of formal equality, explicitly citing *Students for Fair Admissions, Inc. v. Pres. & Fellows of Harv. Coll. (SFFA)*. This directly links the case to the Court's recent, landmark jurisprudence dismantling group-based preferences and tests.\n-   **Prediction (Updated from Cert to Merits):** My prediction has shifted from a **medium** probability of a cert grant to a **high** probability of **reversal** on the merits. The petitioner's arguments are exceptionally well-aligned with the current majority's established jurisprudential methods (textualism, originalism) and ideological commitments (skepticism of judicially-created tests that differentiate based on group identity). The \"background circumstances\" test appears to be a quintessential example of a judge-made gloss on a statute that a textualist-oriented Court would be eager to eliminate.\n-   **Information Gap (Revised):** The original gap\u2014the cert petition\u2014is now of lower priority. The new critical information gap is the **Respondent's Merits Brief**. To refine my prediction, I must understand how the Ohio Department of Youth Services will defend the \"background circumstances\" test against this powerful textualist and equality-based assault.",
          "design_beliefs": "This observation was a powerful lesson in the nature of information retrieval and strategic adaptation. A failed action yielded an unexpectedly valuable result, forcing a significant update to my methodological heuristics.\n\n**Foundational & Tactical Heuristics (Stable and Reinforced):**\nMy core heuristics (#1-15) remain valid.\n\n**Meta-Heuristics (Reinforced and Refined):**\n-   **18. Quarantine and Extract from Anomalous Data (Reinforced):** The search result was anomalous\u2014it wasn't the document I asked for. Instead of discarding it, I extracted its contents, which proved to be of immense value.\n-   **19. The Principle of Foundational Document Precedence (Refined):** This principle is confirmed but refined with a new understanding of context. The \"foundational\" document is not static; it changes with the procedural posture of the case. Pre-cert, it was the petition. Post-cert, it is the merits briefs. My strategy must adapt to the current stage of litigation.\n-   **20. The Heuristic of Retrieval Resilience (Challenged):** My attempt to create a more resilient query failed to retrieve the target document. This shows that resilience isn't just about broadening queries; it's also about diagnosing deeper potential issues with the search tool or database indexing and being prepared for incorrect results.\n-   **21. The DBOED Loop: From Failure to Heuristic to Action (Reinforced):** This cycle is again validated. A failed search action led me to update my design beliefs (D) by creating new heuristics about document verification and \"near miss\" data, which in turn has guided my next strategic objective: acquiring the Respondent's Merits Brief.\n\n**New & Refined Design Beliefs (Learned from this Observation):**\n-   **22. The Principle of Document Verification and Semantic Drift (New):** I cannot implicitly trust a search tool's output, even if it seems relevant. I must actively verify that the retrieved document's metadata and title match the specific *type* of document I requested. A search for a \"petition\" that returns a \"brief\" is a semantic near-miss but a functional error that must be identified.\n-   **23. The Value of \"Near Miss\" Data (New):** A failed information-gathering action can still be a success if the resulting \"near miss\" data provides high-value, task-reorienting information. The failure to find the cert petition was eclipsed by the value of finding the merits brief, which updated the entire task from a cert question to a merits question. I must learn to find the signal in the noise of failed queries."

Title VII\u2019s pro-\ntections apply equally to everyone.  They apply with \nthe same force to members of minority and majority \ngroups.  McDonald v. Santa Fe Trail Transp. Co., \n427 U.S. 273, 278\u201379 (1976).  The Petition argues \nthat the circuits use differing approaches for majori-\nty- and minority-group plaintiffs for one subpart of \none step of one approach to evaluating employment-\ndiscrimination claims.  The Question Presented nev-\ner gets off the ground: Ames did not question the Cir-\ncuit\u2019s longstanding approach to the Question Pre-\nsented until this Court and, not only does the Ques-\ntion Presented does not make a difference to the out-\ncome of this case, it rarely makes a difference in any \ncase. \nPetitioner Marlean Ames never challenged the \nSixth Circuit\u2019s application of the so-called \u201cback-\nground circumstances\u201d approach to Title VII discrim-\nination claims for majority-group plaintiffs.  Her only \nargument below was that she had satisfied that re-\nquirement.  Ames should not be able to raise an ar-\ngument here that she never aired in the courts be-\nlow.  Ames\u2019s failure bears directly on this Court\u2019s re-\nview.  The Sixth Circuit has taken a nuanced ap-\nproach to the background circumstances element\u2014\nbut none of that nuance was relevant in light of the \nway that Ames presented her appeal.  Furthermore, \nat least two Sixth Circuit judges have indicated that \nthey view Students for Fair Admissions v. President \n& Fellows of Harvard College, 600 U.S. 181 (2023) as \n\n2 \n \nresetting the table for the Circuit\u2019s Title VII prece-\ndent, and would rule that way if the issue were \nproperly preserved.  See Smyer v. Kroger Ltd. P\u2019ship \nI, No. 22-3692, 2024 WL 1007116, at *8 (6th Cir. \nMar. 8, 2024) (Boggs, J., concurring); id. at *10 \n(Readler, J., concurring) (also noting that Ames did \nnot raise the Harvard decision). \nWhat is more, answering the Question Presented \nwill not change the outcome here.  Ames challenged \ntwo separate employment actions in the courts be-\nlow: the Department of Youth Services\u2019 failure to \npromote her and its decision to demote her and re-\nplace her with another employee.   \nThe Sixth Circuit held that Ames\u2019s demotion \nclaim failed at a later step of the familiar three-step \napproach to evaluating discrimination claims (see \nMcDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792 \n(1973)).  That employment decision, it held, involved \nno discriminatory motive.  Ames\u2019s Question Present-\ned does not challenge that aspect of the Sixth Cir-\ncuit\u2019s decision and she therefore can no longer chal-\nlenge the Sixth Circuit\u2019s conclusion that the demo-\ntion about which Ames complains was not discrimi-\nnatory.   \nAs for her promotion claim, Ames has affirmative-\nly waived any challenge to the requirement that she \nestablish a prima facie case of discrimination more \ngenerally.  See Pet.28 n.3.  And because she failed to \nintroduce any evidence that the decisionmakers who \nmade the employment decision that she challenges \nknew of her majority-group status (in this case her \nsexual orientation), Ames\u2019s promotion claim would \nhave failed at the prima facie stage even if the Sixth \nCircuit had not used the legal framework Ames chal-\n\n3 \n \nlenges.  What is more, Ames\u2019s claim that she was not \npromoted would also have failed at the next step of \nMcDonnell Douglas\u2019s analysis.  The Department had \nlegitimate, nondiscriminatory, reasons for hiring \nsomeone other than Ames, and Ames has not pointed \nto sufficient evidence to create a genuine issue of fact \nabout whether those reasons were pretextual.   \nEven without these vehicle flaws, the Court \nshould decline review.  Any divergence in how the \ncircuits approach the Question Presented is more \nform than substance; regardless of how each circuit \nspecifically describes its approach to the Question \nPresented, each circuit is focused on the same under-\nlying question.  Every circuit discussed in the Peti-\ntion asks, in one way or another, whether a plaintiff \nhas shown that an employer\u2019s actions, \u201c\u2018if otherwise \nunexplained,\u201d are \u201cmore likely than not based on the \nconsideration of impermissible factors.\u2019\u201d  Tex. Dep\u2019t of \nCmty. Affairs v. Burdine, 450 U.S. 248, 254 (1981) \n(quoting Furnco Constr. Corp. v. Waters, 438 U.S. \n567, 577 (1978)).  Put another way, all the circuits \nare ultimately trained on the question of what\u2014if \nanything\u2014gives rise to an inference that the plaintiff \nis the minority or the outsider in the context of the \nspecific employment decision the lawsuit challenges.  \nFinally, any difference between the circuits, whether \nin language or substance, arose decades ago.  Despite \nthe longevity of any substantive difference, the cir-\ncuit\u2019s varying formulations rarely, if ever change liti-\ngation outcomes.   \nSTATEMENT \nMarlean Ames worked for the Ohio Department \nof Youth Services in a variety of roles.  Pet.App3a.  \nShe was working as the Administrator of the De-\n\n4 \n \npartment\u2019s Prison Rape Elimination Act program \nwhen the Department created a new position, the \nBureau Chief of Quality Assurance and Improve-\nment.  Pet.App.18a.  Ames applied for the new posi-\ntion.  Id. \nThe Bureau Chief position was a management \nrole that was intended to supervise and guide the \nother members of the Office of Quality and Im-\nprovement.  Pet.App.19a.  Among the key skills that \nthe Department was looking for in a successful can-\ndidate were management, supervision, and workforce \nplanning.  Id.  Ames was one of three people who ap-\nplied for the Bureau Chief job.  Id.  None of them \nwere hired.  Pet.App.20a.  Because there was no \ntimeline for filling the position, the Department de-\ncided to wait to hire someone until an ideal candidate \ncould be found.  Id.   \nSix months after Ames had interviewed for the \nBureau Chief role, the Department hired Yolanda \nFrierson for the job.  Pet.App.20a.  Julie Walburn, \nthe assistant director of the Department, made the \ndecision to hire Frierson.  See Pet.App.18a, 20a\u201321a.  \nAlthough Frierson did not interview for the Bureau \nChief job, Walburn had worked with Frierson in the \npast.  Pet.App.21a.  Walburn felt that Frierson would \nbe a good fit for the role because, among other things, \nFrierson had significant management experience.  \nId.  Although Frierson and Ames were both women, \nFrierson, unlike Ames, was gay.  Id. \nNot long after Ames interviewed for the Bureau \nChief position, she was removed from her role admin-\nistering the Prison Rape Elimination Act program.  \nPet.App.4a.  When the Governor appointed a new Di-\nrector of the Department, he had stressed to that Di-\n\n5 \n \nrector, Ryan Gies, that addressing sexual victimiza-\ntion within the juvenile corrections system was a \nhigh priority.  See Pet.App.18a, 21a\u201322a.  Gies there-\nfore began restructuring the Department\u2019s programs.  \nPet.App.21a\u201322a.   \nIt was that restructuring that cost Ames her posi-\ntion.  Pet.App.22a.  Gies felt that Ames was difficult \nto work with.  Id.  And Walburn was concerned that \nAmes could not oversee a more proactive approach to \ncomplying with the Prison Rape Elimination Act.  Id.  \nAmes was reassigned to a different role within the \nDepartment, one that she had previously held and \nthat paid less, Pet.App.18a, and Alex Stojsavljevic \nwas selected to oversee the Prison Rape Elimination \nAct program, Pet.App.23a.  Stojsavljevic is a gay \nman.  See id. \nAmes filed a complaint with the Equal Opportuni-\nty Commission and received a right-to-sue letter.  \nPet.App.4a.  Ames then filed a complaint in federal \ndistrict court.  Id.  As is relevant here, Ames\u2019s com-\nplaint alleged that the Department discriminated \nagainst her on the basis of sexual orientation (which \nis a form of sex discrimination) when it hired Fri-\nerson for the Bureau Chief role (call this her \u201cpromo-\ntion claim\u201d) and that it discriminated against her on \nthe basis of both sex and sexual orientation when it \ndemoted her and replaced her with Stojsavljevic (call \nthis her \u201cdemotion claim\u201d).  Pet.App.5a, 6a.  The dis-\ntrict court granted summary judgment in the De-\npartment\u2019s favor on both claims, see Pet.App.33a, \n39a\u201340a, and the Sixth Circuit affirmed, Pet.App.3a. \nAmes\u2019s claim related to the Bureau Chief position \nfailed, the Sixth Circuit held, because Ames could not \nmake \na \nprima \nfacie \ncase \nof \ndiscrimination.  \n\n6 \n \nPet.App.5a\u20136a.  Under Sixth Circuit precedent, a \nmajority-group plaintiff like Ames must identify evi-\ndence that would \u201csupport the suspicion that the de-\nfendant is that unusual employer who discriminates \nagainst the majority.\u201d  Pet.App.5a (quoting Arendale \nv. City of Memphis, 519 F.3d 587, 603 (6th Cir. \n2008)).  Ames, the Sixth Circuit held, had not.  \nPet.App.5a\u20136a.  Ames conceded in the district court \nthat Walburn and Gies, neither of whom are gay, \nwere the ones who were responsible for hiring Fri-\nerson. see Opposition to Motion for Summary Judg-\nment, R.72, PageID#2488 n.1.  Ames attempted to \nwalk back that admission on appeal.  She argued in \nthe Sixth Circuit that she had demonstrated back-\nground circumstances of discrimination because a \ndifferent individual made the decision to hire Fri-\nerson and that individual was gay.  See Pet.App.6a.  \nThe Sixth Circuit held, however, that Ames\u2019s conces-\nsion in the district court meant that she had forfeited \nthat argument for purposes of appeal.  Id.   \nThe Sixth Circuit held that Ames\u2019s demotion \nclaim failed for the same reason, at least to the ex-\ntent that Ames alleged that the Department discrim-\ninated against her on the basis of her sexual orienta-\ntion when it replaced her with Stojsavljevic.  See \nPet.App.6a.  But because Ames had also alleged that \nthe Department discriminated against her on the ba-\nsis of sex when it demoted her and selected a man to \nfill her prior position, the Sixth Circuit considered \nthe Department\u2019s proffered reasons for that employ-\nment action.  Pet.App.6a\u20139a.  It held that Ames \nfailed to carry her burden of showing that the De-\npartment discriminated against her.  Id.  The De-\npartment, the Sixth Circuit held, had legitimate, \nnondiscriminatory, reasons for demoting Ames and \n\n7 \n \nhiring Stojsavljevic and Ames failed to introduce any \nevidence that would suggest that those reasons were \npretextual.  See id. \nJudge Kethledge concurred.  Although he joined \nthe opinion in full, he wrote that he disagreed with \nSixth Circuit precedent to the extent that it required \nAmes to show, as part of her prima facie case of sex-\nual-orientation discrimination, that the Department \n\u201cis the unusual employer that discriminates against \nthe majority.\u201d  Pet.App.9a (quotation omitted). \nAmes has now filed a petition for a writ of certio-\nrari in which she challenges the Sixth Circuit\u2019s prec-\nedent, which includes a \u201cbackground circumstances\u201d \ncomponent for employment-discrimination claims to \nproceed down the McDonnell Douglas path if the \nplaintiff is a member of a majority group.  That prec-\nedent required her to point to something that indi-\ncated that the Department was the unusual employ-\ner that discriminates against the majority.  See Pet.i.  \nBut the Question Presented does not challenge the \nportion of the Sixth Circuit\u2019s decision that held that \nthe Department had legitimate, nondiscriminatory \nreasons for demoting Ames and replacing her with \nStojsavljevic.  See, generally, Pet.   \nREASONS FOR DENYING THE PETITION \nI. \nThis case provides a poor vehicle with \nwhich to address the Question Presented. \nThis case has numerous vehicle problems that \nmake it a poor case in which to consider the Question \nPresented.  Any one of those problems provides a \nreason to deny Ames\u2019s petition for a writ of certiorari. \nThe context for these vehicle flaws includes both \nlegal and factual background. \n\n8 \n \nLegally, these flaws intersect with this Court\u2019s \nfrequently invoked tool for assessing discrimination \nclaims in McDonnell Douglas.  All Title VII plaintiffs, \nregardless of the group to which they belong, bear \nthe \u201cultimate burden of persuading the trier of fact \nthat \nthe \ndefendant \nintentionally \ndiscriminated \nagainst\u201d them.  Burdine, 450 U.S. at 253.  The Court \nin McDonnell Douglas adopted a three-step analysis \nto assist courts in reviewing Title VII claims.  At the \nfirst step, a plaintiff bears the burden of establishing \na prima facie case of discrimination.  411 U.S. at 802.  \nOnce she does so, the employer must offer a legiti-\nmate, nondiscriminatory, reason for its actions.  Id. \nat 802\u201303. The plaintiff then bears the burden of \nshowing that the employer\u2019s reasons were pretextual.  \nId. at 804.  McDonnell Douglas\u2019s test was \u201cnever in-\ntended to be rigid, mechanized, or ritualistic,\u201d how-\never; it was simply intended to be \u201ca sensible, orderly \nway to evaluate the evidence in light of common ex-\nperience as it bears on the critical question of dis-\ncrimination.\u201d  Furnco Constr. Corp. v. Waters, 438 \nU.S. 567, 577 (1978). \nFactually, these flaws intersect with Ames\u2019s two \nclaimed acts of employment discrimination.  Recall \nthat she initially challenged both the Department\u2019s \ndecision to promote a different person and the De-\npartment\u2019s decision to demote her when it picked a \ndifferent person to fill Ames\u2019s former role.  Ames \nchallenged the promotion decision as illegal sexual-\norientation discrimination and challenged the demo-\ntion decision as both illegal sex and sexual-\norientation discrimination.  And while the Sixth Cir-\ncuit affirmed judgment against Ames on her orienta-\ntion theories for failing the prima facie inquiry with \nrespect to both her promotion and demotion claims, it \n\n9 \n \naffirmed \njudgment \nagainst \nher \non \nthe \nsex-\ndiscrimination theory because Ames could not show \nany pretext in the Department\u2019s decision to demote \nher and to select someone to replace her at her for-\nmer position.  See Pet.App.7a\u20138a.  The Sixth Circuit, \nthat is, rejected Ames\u2019s claim that the Department \ndiscriminated against her when it demoted her.   \nIn this Court, Ames\u2019s Question Presented targets \nonly a component of the prima facie showing.  The \nconsequence of that choice is that Ames cannot chal-\nlenge the Department\u2019s decision to demote her be-\ncause she has not challenged the lower court\u2019s hold-\nings that the demotion decision involved no pretext \n(and thus no discrimination).    \nWith that legal and factual setting, the following \nfour vehicle flaws point against granting review. \nA. \nAmes did not challenge the Sixth \nCircuit\u2019s prima facie test below. \nAmes never challenged the Sixth Circuit\u2019s \u201cback-\nground circumstances\u201d element below.  She argued \ninstead that she satisfied that requirement.  While \nAmes\u2019s litigation strategy may not have forfeited her \nQuestion Presented in the strictest sense, it still \nmakes this case a poor vehicle with which to consider \nthat question. \nThe Court has indicated that parties need not al-\nways raise their arguments for the first time in the \ncircuit courts.  It has noted that there is no require-\nment that a \u201cparty demand overruling of a squarely \napplicable, recent circuit precedent, even though that \nprecedent was established in a case to which the par-\nty itself was privy and over the party\u2019s vigorous ob-\njection.\u201d  United States v. Williams, 504 U.S. 36, 44 \n\n10 \n \n(1992); see also United States v. Vonn, 535 U.S. 55, \n58 (2002).   \nEven if Ames was not required to challenge exist-\ning Sixth Circuit precedent, she at least should not \nbe able to benefit from her failure to do so.  But that, \nin effect, is what she seeks to do.  As discussed in \nmore detail below, the Sixth Circuit has taken a nu-\nanced approach to determining whether a majority-\ngroup plaintiff has identified background circum-\nstances that suggest discrimination.  See below at \n23\u201324, 33\u201335.  Among other things, it has held that \nthe \u201c[background circumstances] requirement is not \nonerous, and can be met through a variety of means.\u201d  \nJohnson v. Metro. Gov\u2019t of Nashville & Davidson \nCnty., 502 F. App\u2019x 523, 536 (6th Cir. 2012).  Had \nAmes argued that such a requirement is inconsistent \nwith Title VII, then the Sixth Circuit would have had \nthe opportunity to discuss its precedent in greater \ndetail.  It could have explained, for example, that the \n\u201cbackground circumstances\u201d requirement is not a \nhigher burden, merely a different one.  But because \nAmes did not raise that issue, the panel had no rea-\nson to reject her framing of the background circum-\nstances element of the prima\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

See McDonnell Doug-\nlas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792 (1973).  Did the \nSixth Circuit err when, in using that rubric, it re-\nquired a discrimination plaintiff to provide some evi-\ndence that the employer had a discriminatory motive \nas part of the prima facie showing?   \n\nii \n \nLIST OF DIRECTLY RELATED PROCEEDINGS \nThe petition\u2019s list of related proceedings is com-\nplete and correct.   \n\niii \n \nTABLE OF CONTENTS \nPage \nQUESTION PRESENTED .......................................... i \nLIST \nOF \nDIRECTLY \nRELATED \nPROCEEDINGS ......................................................... ii \nTABLE OF CONTENTS ........................................... iii \nTABLE OF AUTHORITIES ....................................... v \nINTRODUCTION ....................................................... 1 \nSTATEMENT .............................................................. 3 \nREASONS FOR DENYING THE PETITION ........... 7 \nI. \nThis case provides a poor vehicle with \nwhich \nto \naddress \nthe \nQuestion \nPresented. ...................................................... 7 \nA. Ames did not challenge the Sixth \nCircuit\u2019s prima facie test below. .............. 9 \nB. Answering the Question Presented in \nAmes\u2019s favor would not change the \noutcome in this case because Ames \ncannot satisfy a separate component \nof the prima facie showing. .................... 11 \nC. Even if Ames could establish a prima \nfacie case of discrimination, the \noutcome of this case still would not \nchange. .................................................... 13 \nD. Ames fails to distinguish between the \nportion of the Sixth Circuit\u2019s decision \nthat she has challenged and the \nportion that she has not. ........................ 16 \n\niv \n \nII. \nThere is no meaningful circuit split; the \ndifferences between the circuits are \nlargely differences in language not law. ..... 17 \nA. This Court\u2019s precedent instructs that \nthe McDonnell Douglas test is a \nflexible one. ............................................. 18 \nB. There is no meaningful disagreement \nbetween the circuits about the \nultimate legal standard that \nMcDonnell Douglas established. ........... 21 \n1. In \u201creverse\u201d discrimination cases, the \nSixth, Seventh, Eighth, Tenth, and \nD.C. Circuits describe the prima facie \ncase\u2019s first step as a showing about \nbackground circumstances. ...................... 22 \n2. The Third and Eleventh Circuits are in \naccord with the other circuits. .................. 25 \n3. The First, Second, Fourth, Fifth, and \nNinth Circuits apply a largely similar \nprima facie standard. ................................ 28 \nC. District court uncertainty is not a \nreason to grant Ames\u2019s petition for a \nwrit of certiorari. .................................... 32 \nIII. The Sixth Circuit faithfully applied this \nCourt\u2019s precedent when it held that \nAmes had not made out a prima facie \ncase of discrimination. ................................. 32 \nCONCLUSION .......................................................... 35 \n \n\nv \n \nTABLE OF AUTHORITIES \nPage(s) \nCases \nArendale v.

Title VII\u2019s pro-\ntections apply equally to everyone.  They apply with \nthe same force to members of minority and majority \ngroups.  McDonald v. Santa Fe Trail Transp. Co., \n427 U.S. 273, 278\u201379 (1976).  The Petition argues \nthat the circuits use differing approaches for majori-\nty- and minority-group plaintiffs for one subpart of \none step of one approach to evaluating employment-\ndiscrimination claims.  The Question Presented nev-\ner gets off the ground: Ames did not question the Cir-\ncuit\u2019s longstanding approach to the Question Pre-\nsented until this Court and, not only does the Ques-\ntion Presented does not make a difference to the out-\ncome of this case, it rarely makes a difference in any \ncase. \nPetitioner Marlean Ames never challenged the \nSixth Circuit\u2019s application of the so-called \u201cback-\nground circumstances\u201d approach to Title VII discrim-\nination claims for majority-group plaintiffs.  Her only \nargument below was that she had satisfied that re-\nquirement.  Ames should not be able to raise an ar-\ngument here that she never aired in the courts be-\nlow.  Ames\u2019s failure bears directly on this Court\u2019s re-\nview.  The Sixth Circuit has taken a nuanced ap-\nproach to the background circumstances element\u2014\nbut none of that nuance was relevant in light of the \nway that Ames presented her appeal.  Furthermore, \nat least two Sixth Circuit judges have indicated that \nthey view Students for Fair Admissions v. President \n& Fellows of Harvard College, 600 U.S. 181 (2023) as \n\n2 \n \nresetting the table for the Circuit\u2019s Title VII prece-\ndent, and would rule that way if the issue were \nproperly preserved.  See Smyer v. Kroger Ltd. P\u2019ship \nI, No. 22-3692, 2024 WL 1007116, at *8 (6th Cir. \nMar. 8, 2024) (Boggs, J., concurring); id. at *10 \n(Readler, J., concurring) (also noting that Ames did \nnot raise the Harvard decision). \nWhat is more, answering the Question Presented \nwill not change the outcome here.  Ames challenged \ntwo separate employment actions in the courts be-\nlow: the Department of Youth Services\u2019 failure to \npromote her and its decision to demote her and re-\nplace her with another employee.   \nThe Sixth Circuit held that Ames\u2019s demotion \nclaim failed at a later step of the familiar three-step \napproach to evaluating discrimination claims (see \nMcDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792 \n(1973)).  That employment decision, it held, involved \nno discriminatory motive.  Ames\u2019s Question Present-\ned does not challenge that aspect of the Sixth Cir-\ncuit\u2019s decision and she therefore can no longer chal-\nlenge the Sixth Circuit\u2019s conclusion that the demo-\ntion about which Ames complains was not discrimi-\nnatory.   \nAs for her promotion claim, Ames has affirmative-\nly waived any challenge to the requirement that she \nestablish a prima facie case of discrimination more \ngenerally.  See Pet.28 n.3.  And because she failed to \nintroduce any evidence that the decisionmakers who \nmade the employment decision that she challenges \nknew of her majority-group status (in this case her \nsexual orientation), Ames\u2019s promotion claim would \nhave failed at the prima facie stage even if the Sixth \nCircuit had not used the legal framework Ames chal-\n\n3 \n \nlenges.  What is more, Ames\u2019s claim that she was not \npromoted would also have failed at the next step of \nMcDonnell Douglas\u2019s analysis.  The Department had \nlegitimate, nondiscriminatory, reasons for hiring \nsomeone other than Ames, and Ames has not pointed \nto sufficient evidence to create a genuine issue of fact \nabout whether those reasons were pretextual.   \nEven without these vehicle flaws, the Court \nshould decline review.  Any divergence in how the \ncircuits approach the Question Presented is more \nform than substance; regardless of how each circuit \nspecifically describes its approach to the Question \nPresented, each circuit is focused on the same under-\nlying question.  Every circuit discussed in the Peti-\ntion asks, in one way or another, whether a plaintiff \nhas shown that an employer\u2019s actions, \u201c\u2018if otherwise \nunexplained,\u201d are \u201cmore likely than not based on the \nconsideration of impermissible factors.\u2019\u201d  Tex. Dep\u2019t of \nCmty. Affairs v. Burdine, 450 U.S. 248, 254 (1981) \n(quoting Furnco Constr. Corp. v. Waters, 438 U.S. \n567, 577 (1978)).  Put another way, all the circuits \nare ultimately trained on the question of what\u2014if \nanything\u2014gives rise to an inference that the plaintiff \nis the minority or the outsider in the context of the \nspecific employment decision the lawsuit challenges.  \nFinally, any difference between the circuits, whether \nin language or substance, arose decades ago.  Despite \nthe longevity of any substantive difference, the cir-\ncuit\u2019s varying formulations rarely, if ever change liti-\ngation outcomes.   \nSTATEMENT \nMarlean Ames worked for the Ohio Department \nof Youth Services in a variety of roles.  Pet.App3a.  \nShe was working as the Administrator of the De-\n\n4 \n \npartment\u2019s Prison Rape Elimination Act program \nwhen the Department created a new position, the \nBureau Chief of Quality Assurance and Improve-\nment.  Pet.App.18a.  Ames applied for the new posi-\ntion.  Id. \nThe Bureau Chief position was a management \nrole that was intended to supervise and guide the \nother members of the Office of Quality and Im-\nprovement.  Pet.App.19a.  Among the key skills that \nthe Department was looking for in a successful can-\ndidate were management, supervision, and workforce \nplanning.  Id.  Ames was one of three people who ap-\nplied for the Bureau Chief job.  Id.  None of them \nwere hired.  Pet.App.20a.  Because there was no \ntimeline for filling the position, the Department de-\ncided to wait to hire someone until an ideal candidate \ncould be found.  Id.   \nSix months after Ames had interviewed for the \nBureau Chief role, the Department hired Yolanda \nFrierson for the job.  Pet.App.20a.  Julie Walburn, \nthe assistant director of the Department, made the \ndecision to hire Frierson.  See Pet.App.18a, 20a\u201321a.  \nAlthough Frierson did not interview for the Bureau \nChief job, Walburn had worked with Frierson in the \npast.  Pet.App.21a.  Walburn felt that Frierson would \nbe a good fit for the role because, among other things, \nFrierson had significant management experience.  \nId.  Although Frierson and Ames were both women, \nFrierson, unlike Ames, was gay.  Id. \nNot long after Ames interviewed for the Bureau \nChief position, she was removed from her role admin-\nistering the Prison Rape Elimination Act program.  \nPet.App.4a.  When the Governor appointed a new Di-\nrector of the Department, he had stressed to that Di-\n\n5 \n \nrector, Ryan Gies, that addressing sexual victimiza-\ntion within the juvenile corrections system was a \nhigh priority.  See Pet.App.18a, 21a\u201322a.  Gies there-\nfore began restructuring the Department\u2019s programs.  \nPet.App.21a\u201322a.   \nIt was that restructuring that cost Ames her posi-\ntion.  Pet.App.22a.  Gies felt that Ames was difficult \nto work with.  Id.  And Walburn was concerned that \nAmes could not oversee a more proactive approach to \ncomplying with the Prison Rape Elimination Act.  Id.  \nAmes was reassigned to a different role within the \nDepartment, one that she had previously held and \nthat paid less, Pet.App.18a, and Alex Stojsavljevic \nwas selected to oversee the Prison Rape Elimination \nAct program, Pet.App.23a.  Stojsavljevic is a gay \nman.  See id. \nAmes filed a complaint with the Equal Opportuni-\nty Commission and received a right-to-sue letter.  \nPet.App.4a.  Ames then filed a complaint in federal \ndistrict court.  Id.  As is relevant here, Ames\u2019s com-\nplaint alleged that the Department discriminated \nagainst her on the basis of sexual orientation (which \nis a form of sex discrimination) when it hired Fri-\nerson for the Bureau Chief role (call this her \u201cpromo-\ntion claim\u201d) and that it discriminated against her on \nthe basis of both sex and sexual orientation when it \ndemoted her and replaced her with Stojsavljevic (call \nthis her \u201cdemotion claim\u201d).  Pet.App.5a, 6a.  The dis-\ntrict court granted summary judgment in the De-\npartment\u2019s favor on both claims, see Pet.App.33a, \n39a\u201340a, and the Sixth Circuit affirmed, Pet.App.3a. \nAmes\u2019s claim related to the Bureau Chief position \nfailed, the Sixth Circuit held, because Ames could not \nmake \na \nprima \nfacie \ncase \nof \ndiscrimination.  \n\n6 \n \nPet.App.5a\u20136a.  Under Sixth Circuit precedent, a \nmajority-group plaintiff like Ames must identify evi-\ndence that would \u201csupport the suspicion that the de-\nfendant is that unusual employer who discriminates \nagainst the majority.\u201d  Pet.App.5a (quoting Arendale \nv. City of Memphis, 519 F.3d 587, 603 (6th Cir. \n2008)).  Ames, the Sixth Circuit held, had not.  \nPet.App.5a\u20136a.  Ames conceded in the district court \nthat Walburn and Gies, neither of whom are gay, \nwere the ones who were responsible for hiring Fri-\nerson. see Opposition to Motion for Summary Judg-\nment, R.72, PageID#2488 n.1.  Ames attempted to \nwalk back that admission on appeal.  She argued in \nthe Sixth Circuit that she had demonstrated back-\nground circumstances of discrimination because a \ndifferent individual made the decision to hire Fri-\nerson and that individual was gay.  See Pet.App.6a.  \nThe Sixth Circuit held, however, that Ames\u2019s conces-\nsion in the district court meant that she had forfeited \nthat argument for purposes of appeal.  Id.   \nThe Sixth Circuit held that Ames\u2019s demotion \nclaim failed for the same reason, at least to the ex-\ntent that Ames alleged that the Department discrim-\ninated against her on the basis of her sexual orienta-\ntion when it replaced her with Stojsavljevic.  See \nPet.App.6a.  But because Ames had also alleged that \nthe Department discriminated against her on the ba-\nsis of sex when it demoted her and selected a man to \nfill her prior position, the Sixth Circuit considered \nthe Department\u2019s proffered reasons for that employ-\nment action.  Pet.App.6a\u20139a.  It held that Ames \nfailed to carry her burden of showing that the De-\npartment discriminated against her.  Id.  The De-\npartment, the Sixth Circuit held, had legitimate, \nnondiscriminatory, reasons for demoting Ames and \n\n7 \n \nhiring Stojsavljevic and Ames failed to introduce any \nevidence that would suggest that those reasons were \npretextual.  See id. \nJudge Kethledge concurred.  Although he joined \nthe opinion in full, he wrote that he disagreed with \nSixth Circuit precedent to the extent that it required \nAmes to show, as part of her prima facie case of sex-\nual-orientation discrimination, that the Department \n\u201cis the unusual employer that discriminates against \nthe majority.\u201d  Pet.App.9a (quotation omitted). \nAmes has now filed a petition for a writ of certio-\nrari in which she challenges the Sixth Circuit\u2019s prec-\nedent, which includes a \u201cbackground circumstances\u201d \ncomponent for employment-discrimination claims to \nproceed down the McDonnell Douglas path if the \nplaintiff is a member of a majority group.  That prec-\nedent required her to point to something that indi-\ncated that the Department was the unusual employ-\ner that discriminates against the majority.  See Pet.i.  \nBut the Question Presented does not challenge the \nportion of the Sixth Circuit\u2019s decision that held that \nthe Department had legitimate, nondiscriminatory \nreasons for demoting Ames and replacing her with \nStojsavljevic.  See, generally, Pet.   \nREASONS FOR DENYING THE PETITION \nI. \nThis case provides a poor vehicle with \nwhich to address the Question Presented. \nThis case has numerous vehicle problems that \nmake it a poor case in which to consider the Question \nPresented.  Any one of those problems provides a \nreason to deny Ames\u2019s petition for a writ of certiorari. \nThe context for these vehicle flaws includes both \nlegal and factual background. \n\n8 \n \nLegally, these flaws intersect with this Court\u2019s \nfrequently invoked tool for assessing discrimination \nclaims in McDonnell Douglas.  All Title VII plaintiffs, \nregardless of the group to which they belong, bear \nthe \u201cultimate burden of persuading the trier of fact \nthat \nthe \ndefendant \nintentionally \ndiscriminated \nagainst\u201d them.  Burdine, 450 U.S. at 253.  The Court \nin McDonnell Douglas adopted a three-step analysis \nto assist courts in reviewing Title VII claims.  At the \nfirst step, a plaintiff bears the burden of establishing \na prima facie case of discrimination.  411 U.S. at 802.  \nOnce she does so, the employer must offer a legiti-\nmate, nondiscriminatory, reason for its actions.  Id. \nat 802\u201303. The plaintiff then bears the burden of \nshowing that the employer\u2019s reasons were pretextual.  \nId. at 804.  McDonnell Douglas\u2019s test was \u201cnever in-\ntended to be rigid, mechanized, or ritualistic,\u201d how-\never; it was simply intended to be \u201ca sensible, orderly \nway to evaluate the evidence in light of common ex-\nperience as it bears on the critical question of dis-\ncrimination.\u201d  Furnco Constr. Corp. v. Waters, 438 \nU.S. 567, 577 (1978). \nFactually, these flaws intersect with Ames\u2019s two \nclaimed acts of employment discrimination.  Recall \nthat she initially challenged both the Department\u2019s \ndecision to promote a different person and the De-\npartment\u2019s decision to demote her when it picked a \ndifferent person to fill Ames\u2019s former role.  Ames \nchallenged the promotion decision as illegal sexual-\norientation discrimination and challenged the demo-\ntion decision as both illegal sex and sexual-\norientation discrimination.  And while the Sixth Cir-\ncuit affirmed judgment against Ames on her orienta-\ntion theories for failing the prima facie inquiry with \nrespect to both her promotion and demotion claims, it \n\n9 \n \naffirmed \njudgment \nagainst \nher \non \nthe \nsex-\ndiscrimination theory because Ames could not show \nany pretext in the Department\u2019s decision to demote \nher and to select someone to replace her at her for-\nmer position.  See Pet.App.7a\u20138a.  The Sixth Circuit, \nthat is, rejected Ames\u2019s claim that the Department \ndiscriminated against her when it demoted her.   \nIn this Court, Ames\u2019s Question Presented targets \nonly a component of the prima facie showing.  The \nconsequence of that choice is that Ames cannot chal-\nlenge the Department\u2019s decision to demote her be-\ncause she has not challenged the lower court\u2019s hold-\nings that the demotion decision involved no pretext \n(and thus no discrimination).    \nWith that legal and factual setting, the following \nfour vehicle flaws point against granting review. \nA. \nAmes did not challenge the Sixth \nCircuit\u2019s prima facie test below. \nAmes never challenged the Sixth Circuit\u2019s \u201cback-\nground circumstances\u201d element below.  She argued \ninstead that she satisfied that requirement.  While \nAmes\u2019s litigation strategy may not have forfeited her \nQuestion Presented in the strictest sense, it still \nmakes this case a poor vehicle with which to consider \nthat question. \nThe Court has indicated that parties need not al-\nways raise their arguments for the first time in the \ncircuit courts.  It has noted that there is no require-\nment that a \u201cparty demand overruling of a squarely \napplicable, recent circuit precedent, even though that \nprecedent was established in a case to which the par-\nty itself was privy and over the party\u2019s vigorous ob-\njection.\u201d  United States v. Williams, 504 U.S. 36, 44 \n\n10 \n \n(1992); see also United States v. Vonn, 535 U.S. 55, \n58 (2002).   \nEven if Ames was not required to challenge exist-\ning Sixth Circuit precedent, she at least should not \nbe able to benefit from her failure to do so.  But that, \nin effect, is what she seeks to do.  As discussed in \nmore detail below, the Sixth Circuit has taken a nu-\nanced approach to determining whether a majority-\ngroup plaintiff has identified background circum-\nstances that suggest discrimination.  See below at \n23\u201324, 33\u201335.  Among other things, it has held that \nthe \u201c[background circumstances] requirement is not \nonerous, and can be met through a variety of means.\u201d  \nJohnson v. Metro. Gov\u2019t of Nashville & Davidson \nCnty., 502 F. App\u2019x 523, 536 (6th Cir. 2012).  Had \nAmes argued that such a requirement is inconsistent \nwith Title VII, then the Sixth Circuit would have had \nthe opportunity to discuss its precedent in greater \ndetail.  It could have explained, for example, that the \n\u201cbackground circumstances\u201d requirement is not a \nhigher burden, merely a different one.  But because \nAmes did not raise that issue, the panel had no rea-\nson to reject her framing of the background circum-\nstances element of the prima facie test.  Put another \nway, one of the reasons that Ames is now able to crit-\nicize the decision below as overly stringent and in-\nflexible is because she herself framed it that way.  \nAnd while that is not waiver or forfeiture formally, \nthe fact that Ames \u201cdid not raise or brief\u201d the ques-\ntion presented \u201cbelow\u201d is a reason to deny certiorari.  \nHoggard v. Rhodes, 141 S. Ct. 2421, 2422 (2021) \n(Thomas, J., respecting the denial of certiorari). \n\n11 \n \nB. \nAnswering the Question Presented \nin Ames\u2019s favor would not change \nthe outcome in this case because \nAmes cannot satisfy a separate \ncomponent of the prima facie \nshowing. \nAmes has affirmatively waived any challenge to \nthe requirement that she establish a prima facie case \nof discrimination.  Pet.28 n.3.  Her only challenge is \nto how the Sixth Circuit applied one component of \nthat rubric in this case.  Ames\u2019s Question Presented \nasks whether, to establish a prima facie case of dis-\ncrimination under Title VII, a majority-group plain-\ntiff must introduce evidence of \u201cbackground circum-\nstances\u201d that suggest discrimination.  See Pet.i.  But \nthe answer to that question will not affect the out-\ncome of this case.  Even if the answer is \u201cno\u201d Ames \nstill could not make a prima facie case of sex discrim-\nination.  And that is a prime reason to deny certiora-\nri.  The Court should \u201cnot ... take up\u201d a question pre-\nsented if the claims underlying that question are \u201cin-\ndependently subject to\u201d defenses that would yield the \nsame result regardless of how the Court answers the \nquestion.  Blankenship v. NBCUniversal, LLC, 144 S. \nCt. 5, 6 (2023) (Thomas, J., concurring in the denial \nof certiorari) \nThere appears to be universal agreement that an \n\u201cemployer cannot intentionally discriminate on the \nbasis of a characteristic of which the employer has no \nknowledge.\u201d  Bostock v. Clayton Cty., 590 U.S. 644, \n691 (2020) (Alito, J., dissenting).  As far as the De-\npartment is aware, every circuit that has considered \nthe question has held that in \u201ccases involving per-\nsonal attributes not obvious to the employer,\u201d a \n\n12 \n \n\u201cplaintiff cannot make out a prima facie case of dis-\ncrimination unless he or she proves that the employ-\ner knew about the plaintiff\u2019s particular personal \ncharacteristic.\u201d  Geraci v. Moody-Tottrup, Int\u2019l, 82 \nF.3d 578, 581 (3d Cir. 1996); Hunter v. UPS, 697 \nF.3d 697, 703\u201304 (8th Cir. 2012); Robinson v. Adams, \n847 F.2d 1315, 1316 (9th Cir. 1987); Lubetsky v. Ap-\nplied Card Sys., 296 F.3d 1301, 1305\u201306 (11th Cir. \n2002); cf. also Raytheon Co. v. Hernandez, 540 U.S. \n44, 54 n.7 (2003) (\u201cIf [an employer] were truly una-\nware that \u2026 a disability existed, it would be impos-\nsible for her hiring decision to have been based, even \nin part, on [the employee\u2019s] disability.\u201d); Landefel v. \nMarion Gen. Hosp., Inc., 994 F.2d 1178, 1181\u201382 (6th \nCir. 1993) (same).  The reverse is also true.  An em-\nployer cannot discriminate in favor of a different em-\nployee if the employer has no knowledge of the fa-\nvored employee\u2019s personal characteristics.  See, e.g., \nPetrikonis v. Wilkes-Barre Hosp. Co., LLC, 582 F. \nApp\u2019x 126, 130 (3d Cir. 2014); Morrow v. Wal\u2013Mart \nStores, Inc., 152 F.3d 559, 563 (7th Cir.1998). \nAmes, however, introduced no evidence that \nwould create a genuine issue of material fact about \nwhether the relevant decisionmakers were aware of \nher sexual orientation, or of the orientation of Fri-\nerson, the person who was ultimately hired for the \njob to which Ames had applied.  The only evidence on \nthat point indicated just the opposite.  The only evi-\ndence related to Walburn\u2019s knowledge with respect to \neither woman showed that she was unaware of Fri-\nerson\u2019s sexual orientation (and was silent with re-\nspect to Ames).  See Motion for Summary Judgment, \nR.71, PageID#2375 (citing Walburn Depo. R.60, \nPageID#668).  And the only evidence related to oth-\ners\u2019 knowledge of Ames\u2019s sexual orientation showed \n\n13 \n \nthat her direct supervisor did not know whether \nAmes was gay or straight.  See id. at 2367 (citing \nTrim Depo., R.64, PageID#1511).  Ames\u2019s failure to \nintroduce any evidence on this point means that no \nmatter how the Court answers the Question Present-\ned her discrimination claim would still fail at the \nprima facia stage.   \nTo be sure, the Sixth Circuit noted that, if not for \nthe background circumstances element, then Ames\u2019s \nprima facie case would have been \u201ceasy to make.\u201d  \nSee Pet.App.5a.  It is clear from context, however, \nthat the Sixth Circuit was referring only to the ele-\nments of a prima facie case discussed in McDonnell \nDouglas.  See id.  Knowledge of an employee\u2019s per-\nsonal characteristics is an additional, threshold, re-\nquirement of a prima facie case, however, and one \nthat the Sixth Circuit did not discuss.  See id.; \nGeraci, 82 F.3d at 581 (noting that McDonnell Doug-\nlas \u201cquite properly makes no reference to the em-\nployer\u2019s knowledge of membership in a protected \nclass\u201d because some protected traits will be known to \nmanagement merely by seeing the employee).     \nC. \nEven if Ames could establish a \nprima facie case of discrimination, \nthe outcome of this case still would \nnot change. \nA favorable answer to the Question Presented \nwould not change the result here for a second, inde-\npendent reason\u2014Ames\u2019s claim fails at the later stag-\nes of McDonnell Douglas.  Even if Ames could make \na prima facie case of discrimination, her promotion \nclaim would fail at McDonnell Douglas\u2019s second and \nthird stages.   \n\n14 \n \nThe Department had nondiscriminatory reasons \nfor its hiring decision and Ames cannot show that \nthose reasons were pretextual.  True, the concur-\nrence suggested otherwise below, Pet.App.10a, and \nAmes now makes a similar argument in her petition, \nsee Pet.32.  But they are both off base.  In response to \nthe Department\u2019s motion for summary judgment, \nAmes failed to point to any evidence that created a \ngenuine issue of material fact about whether the De-\npartment\u2019s decision to hire Frierson (instead of \nAmes) was pretextual.  Indeed, Ames did the oppo-\nsite.  She accepted the Department\u2019s recitation of the \nrelevant facts in its summary judgment motion as \ncorrect (with the exception of two minor issues that \nare not relevant here).  See Opposition to Motion for \nSummary Judgment, R.72, PageID#2488 n.1.   \nTo the extent that the concurrence below suggest-\ned that Ames\u2019s case faltered only at the prima facie \nshowing\u2019s step one, it was confused about the facts \nand evidence presented at summary judgment.  The \nconcurrence identified two factors that, it believed, \nprovided strong evidence of pretext: that the De-\npartment twice promoted a gay employee in a \u201cman-\nner adverse to Ames\u201d and that Frierson lacked the \nminimum qualifications for the job for which she was \nhired.  It was wrong on both counts. \nThe first factor\u2014which involved replacing Ames \nas the administrator of the Prison Rape Elimination \nAct program\u2014was irrelevant.  The Sixth Circuit held \nthat the Department had legitimate, nondiscrimina-\ntory, reasons for hiring Stojsavljevic, the other gay \nindividual that the concurrence referenced, for that \nposition, and Ames has not challenged that portion of \nthe Sixth Circuit\u2019s decision through her Question \n\n15 \n \nPresented.  Because it is now settled that the De-\npartment did not discriminate against Ames when it \nhired Stojsavljevic, that hiring decision cannot serve \nas evidence that the Department\u2019s other actions were \npretextual.  See Pet.12 n.2 (waiving any challenge to \nthe Sixth Circuit\u2019s sex discrimination ruling).   \nAs for the concurrence\u2019s second factor, it misread \nthe record when it stated that Frierson \u201clacked the \nminimum qualifications for the job\u201d for which she \nwas hired.  See Pet.App.10a.  The undisputed evi-\ndence showed that Frierson was qualified.  The job \nposting listed alternative qualifications: an applicant \nwas required to have either a college degree or rele-\nvant work experience.  Motion for Summary Judg-\nment, East Decl., R.71-4, PageID#2419.  And while \nFrierson did not have a degree, she did have the ex-\nperience.  Motion for Summary Judgment, East \nDecl., R.71-5, PageID#2460\u201368.  It was that experi-\nence, in fact, that led the Department to hire her.  \nWalburn Depo., R.60, PageID#635\u201337, 639.  Ames \nmay have argued in the Sixth Circuit that Frierson \nwas not qualified, but she did not introduce any evi-\ndence that created a genuine issue of material fact \nabout Frierson\u2019s qualifications.  Cf. Ames Opposition \nto Summary Judgment, R.72, PageID#2488 (conced-\ning that \u201c[t]he Statement of Facts included in the De-\nfendant\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment is largely \ncorrect\u201d).  Ames\u2019s argument was different in the dis-\ntrict court.  Ames never argued in the district court \nthat Frierson was unqualified.  See Opposition to \nMotion for Summary Judgment, R.72, PageID#2495\u2013\n96.  She argued only that she was more qualified \nthan Frierson was.  Id.  \n\n16 \n \nBecause the Sixth Circuit would likely \u201chave \nreached the same conclusion\u201d that the Department \nshould prevail on summary judgment even if it \nagreed with Ames, certiorari is unwarranted.  See, \ne.g., Hittson v. Chatman, 576 U.S. 1028 (2015) (Gins-\nburg, J., concurring in the denial of certiorari). \nD. \nAmes fails to distinguish between \nthe portion of the Sixth Circuit\u2019s \ndecision that she has challenged \nand the portion that she has not. \nThe Sixth Circuit below considered two separate \ndiscrimination claims and rejected them both.  It \nheld that Ames had failed to make a prima facie case \nof discrimination with respect to her promotion \nclaim.  It also held that Ames had failed to show that \nthe Department\u2019s decision to demote and replace her \nwas discriminatory.  Ames\u2019s demotion claim rested \non two theories of discrimination: sex and sexual ori-\nentation.  But although the Sixth Circuit held that \nAmes had established a prima facie case of discrimi-\nnation only with respect to her sex-discrimination \ntheory, that does not matter; the same nondiscrimi-\nnatory reasons were sufficient to resolve Ames\u2019s sex \nand sexual orientation theories.  Title VII claims \nchallenge employment actions.  See 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a72000e-2(a).  And, generally, the \u201csame legitimate, \nnondiscriminatory reasons that [an employer] ad-\nvance[d] against a finding of \u2026 discrimination apply \nequally to\u201d all similar claims of discrimination aris-\ning from the same event, even if the protected class \nthat provides the basis for the claim differs.  Cf. Hrd-\nlicka v. GM LLC, 63 F.4th 555, 575 (6th Cir. 2023). \nAmes has not challenged the portion of the Sixth \nCircuit\u2019s decision that held that the Department had \n\n17 \n \nnondiscriminatory reasons for demoting her.  The \nQuestion Presented therefore involves only Ames\u2019s \nclaim that the Department discriminated against her \nwhen it promoted Frierson instead of her.  See Pet.i.  \nIn other words, it involves only her promotion claim, \nnot her demotion claim.   \nAmes confuses the Question Presented in this \ncase by suggesting otherwise.  Ames writes that this \ncase involves a \u201cdemotion decision.\u201d  See Pet.32.  Not \nso.  The demotion decision she references involves \nthe demotion claim that she has not challenged \nthrough her Question Presented.  Ames\u2019s failure to \nproperly distinguish between the claim that is before \nthe court, and the one that is not, provides just one \nmore reason why this case provides a poor vehicle to \naddress the Question Presented.  \u201c[A]t the very least\u201d \nAmes\u2019s litigation strategy \u201cwould complicate [the \nCourt\u2019s] review.\u201d  Gordon Coll. v. DeWeese-Boyd, 142 \nS. Ct. 952 (2022) (Alito, J., respecting the denial of \ncertiorari).  And that is reason enough to deny certio-\nrari. \nII. \nThere is no meaningful circuit split; the \ndifferences between the circuits are \nlargely differences in language not law. \nThe Court should deny certiorari even if this \ncase\u2019s vehicle problems did not otherwise render it \nnon-cert worthy.  Ames claims to spy a circuit split \nwith respect to the relevant prima facie test for dis-\ncrimination claims brought by members of a majority \ngroup.  But any differences between the circuits are \nmore differences of terminology than consequential \nlegal substance.   Regardless of the long-standing dif-\nference in language that some circuits use, the out-\ncome is largely the same. \n\n18 \n \nA. \nThis Court\u2019s precedent instructs \nthat the McDonnell Douglas test is \na flexible one.  \nThis Court\u2019s decision in McDonnell Douglas pro-\nvides the foundation for a large majority of Title VII \nclaims.  Ames does not dispute that every circuit, \neven those that she alleges conflict with one another, \napplies that decision to at least some degree.  To the \nextent that Ames alleges that a split exists, it is a \nsplit over how the various circuits apply McDonnell \nDouglas.  Before addressing Ames\u2019s claimed split, \nsome background about that decision, and the \nCourt\u2019s precedent interpreting and applying it, is \ntherefore needed. \nBecause direct evidence of discrimination \u201c\u2018essen-\ntially requires an admission by the employer,\u2019 such \nevidence \u2018is rare.\u2019\u201d  Argyropoulos v. City of Alton, 539 \nF.3d 724, 733 (7th Cir. 2008) (citations omitted). \nThat is one reason why the Court adopted what is \nnow known as the McDonnell Douglas test.  Under \nthat test, a plaintiff may rely on indirect evidence to \nprove a discrimination claim.  The first step of \nMcDonnell Douglas\u2019s test requires a plaintiff to es-\ntablish a prima facie case of discrimination by show-\ning four things: \u201c(i) that he belongs to a racial minor-\nity; (ii) that he applied and was qualified for a job for \nwhich the employer was seeking applicants; (iii) that, \ndespite his qualifications, he was rejected; and (iv) \nthat, after his rejection, the position remained open \nand the employer continued to seek applicants from \npersons of complainant\u2019s qualifications.\u201d  McDonnell \nDouglas, 411 U.S. at 802.  But because \u201cfacts neces-\nsarily will vary in Title VII cases,\u201d the Court in \nMcDonnell Douglas acknowledged that the four-part \n\n19 \n \ntest it laid out will not apply \u201cin every respect to dif-\nfering factual situations.\u201d  Id. at 802 n.13.  Indeed, \npart one \u201cof this sample pattern of proof was set out \nonly to demonstrate how the racial character of the \ndiscrimination could be established in the most \ncommon sort of case, and not as an indication of any \nsubstantive limitation of Title VII\u2019s prohibition of ra-\ncial discrimination.\u201d  McDonald, 427 U.S. at 279 n.6 \n(1976) \nThe Court\u2019s subsequent decisions reaffirmed that \nMcDonnell Douglas was \u201c\u2018never intended to be rigid, \nmechanized, or ritualistic. Rather, it is merely a sen-\nsible, orderly way to evaluate the evidence in light of \ncommon experience as it bears on the critical ques-\ntion of discrimination.\u2019\u201d  USPS Bd. of Governors v. \nAikens, 460 U.S. 711, 715 (1983) (quoting Furnco, \n438 U.S. at 577).  The relevant question in Title VII \ncases is \u201calways whether the employer is treating \n\u2018some people less favorably than others because of \ntheir race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.\u2019\u201d \nFurnco, 438 U.S. at 577 (quoting Int\u2019l Brotherhood of \nTeamsters v. United States, 431 U.S. 324, 335 n.15 \n(1977)).  A plaintiff makes out a prima facie case of \ndiscrimination under McDonnell Douglas and Title \nVII by \u201cshowing actions taken by the employer from \nwhich one can infer, if such actions remain unex-\nplained, that it is more likely than not that such ac-\ntions were \u2018based on a discriminatory criterion illegal \nunder the Act.\u2019\u201d  Furnco, 438 U.S. at 576 (quoting \nTeamsters, 431 U.S. at 358); see also Young v. UPS, \n575 U.S. 206, 228 (2015) (same).  McDonnell Douglas \nis not an end in itself; it exists simply to eliminate \n\u201cthe most common nondiscriminatory reasons for the \nplaintiff\u2019s rejection.\u201d  Burdine, 450 U.S. at 253\u201354.   \n\n20 \n \nConsistent with the Court\u2019s precedent, lower \ncourts have modified McDonnell Douglas\u2019s test as \nnecessary to account for a specific plaintiff\u2019s discrim-\nination claims.  They have, for example, adopted \nmodified versions of the McDonnell Douglas test to \ngovern discriminatory promotion claims, Bundy v. \nJackson, 641 F.2d 934, 951 (D.C. Cir. 1981), retalia-\ntion claims, Laster v. City of Kalamazoo, 746 F.3d \n714, 730 (6th Cir. 2014), and discriminatory disci-\npline claims, Reives v. Illinois State Police, 29 F.4th \n887, 891\u201392 (7th Cir. 2022); see also Murray v. This-\ntledown Racing Club, Inc., 770 F.2d 63, 67 (6th Cir. \n1985) (noting that \u201ccourts have modified the McDon-\nnell Douglas standard to address disparate treat-\nment cases involving all discrimination prohibited by \nthe Act in promotion, firing, compensation or other \nconditions of employment\u201d). \nOne other modification involves claims by majori-\nty-group plaintiffs;  what some call \u201creverse\u201d discrim-\nination.  It is impossible to apply McDonnell Douglas \nliterally to such cases. The first prong of the McDon-\nnell Douglas prima facie test asks, after all, whether \nthe plaintiff was a \u201cracial minority.\u201d  McDonnell \nDouglas, 411 U.S. at 802; see also Parker v. Balti-\nmore & Ohio R. Co., 652 F.2d 1012, 1017 (D.C. Cir. \n1981).  Courts must therefore always adapt McDon-\nnell Douglas to at least some degree when they are \nconfronted with a \u201creverse\u201d discrimination claim.  \nThe Sixth Circuit, like many courts around the coun-\ntry, has adopted a prima facie test to govern discrim-\nination claims filed by members of a majority group \nwho allege that they were discriminated against in \nfavor of a minority group.  Those courts require a \nplaintiff who alleges discrimination based on the \nplaintiff\u2019s membership in a majority group to point to \n\n21 \n \nbackground circumstances that provide some evi-\ndence to \u201csupport the suspicion that the defendant is \nthat unusual employer who discriminates against the \nmajority.\u201d  Thistledown Racing, 770 F.2d at 67 (quot-\ning Parker, 652 F.2d at 1017).  This requirement is \noften shorthanded as simply a \u201cbackground circum-\nstances\u201d requirement.  But regardless of its label, a \nmajority plaintiff\u2019s burden, like the burden minority \nplaintiffs bear, is \u201cnot onerous.\u201d  Compare Johnson, \n502 F. App\u2019x at 536 with Burdine, 450 U.S. at 253. \nB. \nThere is no meaningful \ndisagreement between the circuits \nabout the ultimate legal standard \nthat McDonnell Douglas \nestablished. \nAmes argues that there is a split over how Courts \nhave applied McDonnell Douglas to \u201creverse\u201d dis-\ncrimination claims.  She groups the circuits into \nthree categories 1) circuits that have adopted a \n\u201cbackground circumstances\u201d requirement, 2) circuits \nthat she claims do not apply a \u201cbackground circum-\nstances\u201d requirement, and 3) circuits that have ex-\nplicitly rejected such a requirement.  See Pet.14\u201325  \nA close examination of the cases she cites reveals, \nhowever, that even though some circuits have used \ndifferent language to describe their approach, they \nultimately all focus on the same basic legal question: \nare there facts from which one can \u201cinfer, if such ac-\ntions remain unexplained, that it is more likely than \nnot that [an employer\u2019s] actions were based on a dis-\ncriminatory criterion illegal under\u201d Title VII.  \nFurnco, 438 U.S. at 576 (quotation omitted). \n\n22 \n \n1. \nIn \u201creverse\u201d discrimination \ncases, the Sixth, Seventh, \nEighth, Tenth, and D.C. \nCircuits describe the prima \nfacie case\u2019s first step as a \nshowing about background \ncircumstances. \nThe D.C. Circuit was one of the first courts to ap-\nply McDonnell Douglas to a \u201creverse\u201d discrimination \nclaim.  It noted that \u201c[m]embership in a socially dis-\nfavored group was the assumption on which the en-\ntire McDonnell Douglas analysis was predicated,\u201d \nand that the first element of the prima facie test \ntherefore necessarily needed to adapt when a mem-\nber of a majority group filed a Title VII claim.  Par-\nker, 652 F.2d at 1017   Applying a modified version of \nMcDonnell Douglas, it held that a plaintiff who is a \nmember of a majority group makes out a prima facie \nshowing of discrimination when she demonstrates \nthat \u201cbackground circumstances support the suspi-\ncion that the defendant is that unusual employer \nwho discriminates against the majority.\u201d  See id.  \nSuch circumstances, the D.C. Circuit wrote, \u201cserved \nas a functional equivalent of the first McDonnell \nDouglas criterion, membership in a racial minority.\u201d  \nId. at 1018.  Applying that standard, the court held \nthat the plaintiff in Parker made out a prima facie \ncase of discrimination when he pointed to a racially \ndiscriminatory work environment.  Id.  Subsequent \nD.C. Circuit decisions made clear that the \u201cback-\nground circumstances\u201d element is not intended to \ndisadvantage plaintiffs who are members of majority \ngroups, nor is it \u201can additional hurdle.\u201d  Harding v. \nGray, 9 F.3d 150, 153\u201354 (D.C. Cir. 1993).  It is simp-\nly a tool for \u201cdetermining when an employer\u2019s con-\n\n23 \n \nduct raises an inference of discrimination under the \nSupreme \nCourt\u2019s \nMcDonnell \nDouglas/Burdine \nstandard.\u201d  Id. at 153.  \nFollowing Parker, the Sixth, Seventh, Eighth, and \nTenth circuits have used the \u201cbackground circum-\nstances\u201d language to describe the first component of \na prima facie analysis for \u201creverse\u201d discrimination \nclaims.  Like the D.C. Circuit, however, those circuits \nhave emphasized that \u201cbackground circumstances\u201d \ncomponent is easily satisfied.  Most significantly for \npurposes of this case, the Sixth Circuit has held that \nthe background circumstances \u201crequirement is not \nonerous, and can be met through a variety of means.\u201d  \nJohnson, 502 F. App\u2019x at 536.  A male plaintiff in a \nfailure-to-hire case, for example, can satisfy the re-\nquirement by showing that the decisionmaker and \nthe person ultimately hired were both women.  See \nPet.App.6a.  He can demonstrate \u201cbackground cir-\ncumstances,\u201d in other words, by showing that he was \nin the minority in the relevant sense. \nThe Sixth Circuit\u2019s recent decisions, which make \nclear that a plaintiff\u2019s burden is not onerous, also put \nto rest any concerns in older Sixth Circuit decisions \nthat majority-group plaintiffs may bear a high bur-\nden.  See Pierce v. Commonwealth Life Ins. Co., 40 \nF.3d 796, 801 n.7 (6th Cir. 1994); cf. Briggs v. Porter, \n463 F.3d 507, 517 (6th Cir. 2006) (describing a plain-\ntiff\u2019s burden as \u201cmore difficult\u201d).  To the extent that \nthe Sixth Circuit in past decades may have expressed \nmisgivings about the \u201cbackground circumstances\u201d \nanalysis, its more recent decisions have clarified the \nshowing\u2019s low bar.  See Johnson, 502 F. App\u2019x at 536. \nThe Seventh, Eighth, and Tenth Circuits also do \nnot treat the background circumstances requirement \n\n24 \n \nas onerous.  They too look to it as nothing more than \na substitute for otherwise inapplicable elements of \nthe prima facie test discussed in McDonnell Douglas.  \nThe Seventh Circuit, in adopting a background cir-\ncumstances requirement, emphasized that the re-\nquirement \u201cis not to be interpreted in a constricting \nfashion.\u201d  Mills v. Health Care Serv. Corp., 171 F.3d \n450, 457 (7th Cir. 1999).  And the Eighth Circuit and \nTenth Circuits have likewise treated the background \ncircumstances component of a prima facie case not as \na \u201chigher\u201d or \u201cadditional\u201d burden, but simply an al-\nternative showing that plaintiffs must make \u201cin lieu \nof\u201d showing that the plaintiff belongs to a minority \ngroup.  Notari v. Denver Water Dep\u2019t., 971 F.2d 585, \n589 (10th Cir. 1992); Hammer v. Ashcroft, 383 F.3d \n722, 724 (8th Cir. 2004); see also Duffy v. Wolle, 123 \nF.3d 1026, 1035\u201337 (8th Cir. 1997) (applying \nMcDonnell Douglas framework to a Bivens v. Six \nUnknown Fed. Narcotics Agents, 403 U.S. 388, (1971) \nclaim). \nMost significantly, none of the circuits that use \nthe \u201cbackground circumstances\u201d language dispute \nthat plaintiffs who are members of a majority group \nare \u201centitled to the same Title VII protection as a \nminority plaintiff.\u201d  Harding, 9 F.3d at 153; see also \nThistledown Racing, 770 F.2d at 67 (\u201cTitle VII, of \ncourse, prohibits racial discrimination against all \ngroups\u201d); Mills, 171 F.3d at 454\u201355 (\u201c[I]t is well set-\ntled law that the protections of Title VII are not lim-\nited to members of historically discriminated-against \ngroups.\u201d); Schaffhauser v. UPS, 794 F.3d 899, 902 \n(8th Cir. 2015) (\u201cTitle VII prohibits an employer from \ndiscriminating against any individual \u2018because of \nsuch individual\u2019s race.\u2019\u201d (emphasis added)); Notari, \n971 F.2d at 588 (noting that \u201cit is clear that Title \n\n25 \n \nVII\u2019s protection is not limited to those individuals \nwho are members of historically or socially disfa-\nvored groups\u201d). \n2. \nThe Third and Eleventh \nCircuits are in accord with \nthe other circuits. \nAmes argues that there is a direct conflict be-\ntween the Third and Eleventh Circuits and those cir-\ncuits that apply a \u201cbackground circumstances\u201d re-\nquirement as part of the prima facie test for \u201creverse\u201d \ndiscrimination claims.  The Third and Eleventh cir-\ncuits, she claims have \u201cexplicitly rejected\u201d such a re-\nquirement.  Pet.19.  Ames overreads those decisions.  \nWhile the Third and Eleventh Circuits have chosen \nnot to apply an explicit \u201cbackground circumstances\u201d \nrequirement, those circuits still apply the same basic \nTitle VII standard that other circuits apply. \nThe Third Circuit, it is true, has declined to adopt \nthe \u201cbackground circumstances\u201d language in \u201cre-\nverse\u201d discrimination cases.  Iadimarco v. Runyon, \n190 F.3d 151, 160 (3d Cir. 1999).  But it has never-\ntheless recognized that there are problems with the \n\u201cwording of the very first prong of the McDonnell \nDouglas [prima facie] test\u201d that mandate at least \nsome modification of that test with respect to \u201cre-\nverse\u201d discrimination claims.  Id. at 158.  Rather \nthan use the language of \u201cbackground circumstanc-\nes,\u201d however, it has held that a Title VII plaintiff \n\u201cshould be able to establish a prima facie case \u2026 by \npresenting sufficient evidence to allow a reasonable \nfact finder to conclude (given the totality of the cir-\ncumstances) that the defendant treated [a] plaintiff \n\u2018less favorably than others because of [his] race, col-\nor, religion, sex, or national origin.\u2019\u201d  Id. at 163 (quot-\n\n26 \n \ning Furnco, 438 U.S. at 577).  That is not meaning-\nfully different from the legal standard that other cir-\ncuits apply.  The Third Circuit in fact acknowledged \nthat the background-circumstances requirement, as \napplied by the circuits that have adopted it, often re-\nquires only that a plaintiff offer \u201csufficient evidence \nto support the reasonable probability of discrimina-\ntion.\u201d  Id. at 162. \nAt least one member of the Iadimarco panel be-\nlieved the primary difference between the test that \nthe Third Circuit adopted and the \u201cbackground cir-\ncumstances\u201d test was their wording and that the \nThird Circuit\u2019s test was \u201cmerely a restatement of the \nMcDonnell Douglas test.\u201d  Id. at 163 n.10.  That \nmember of the panel rejected the \u201cbackground cir-\ncumstances\u201d phrasing not because it was necessarily \nan incorrect statement of law, but because its fram-\ning was \u201cjust too vague and too prone to misinterpre-\ntation and confusion to apply fairly and consistently.\u201d  \nId.   \nThe other Third Circuit decisions that Ames cites \nalso do not support her claimed split.  The Third Cir-\ncuit did not discuss \u201cbackground circumstances\u201d at \nall in Phillips v. Legacy Cabinets, 87 F.4th 1313 \n(11th Cir. 2023).  Even if it had, it would not have \nmattered.  Because the plaintiff and the relevant de-\ncisionmaker were of different races, see id. at 1316, \nthe plaintiff would have been able to demonstrate \nbackground \ncircumstances \nin \nany \nevent, \nsee \nPet.App.5a.  Ellis v. Bank of N.Y. Mellon Corp, is \neven less relevant; all that the Third Circuit did in \nthat case was state the obvious proposition that a \n\u201creverse\u201d discrimination plaintiff \u201cneed not show she \n\n27 \n \nis a member of a minority group.\u201d  837 F. App\u2019x 940, \n941 n.3 (2021). \nThe Eleventh Circuit decisions that Ames cites \nare of even less relevance.  Two of the cases did not \ninvolve McDonnell Douglas\u2019s prima facie test at all.  \nBass v. Bd. of County Comm\u2019rs, 256 F.3d 1095, 1104  \n(11th Cir. 2001) (\u201cIn this case, the County has not \ndisputed that Bass established a prima facie case of \ndiscrimination under the McDonnell Douglas frame-\nwork.\u201d); Smith v. Lockheed-Martin Corp., 644 F.3d \n1321, 1328 (11th Cir. 2011) (\u201cHere, Mitten did not \nneed to rely on the McDonnell Douglas presumption \nto establish a case for the jury.\u201d).  Any discussion of \nthe \u201cbackground circumstances\u201d element in those de-\ncisions was therefore dicta.  But even then, to the ex-\ntent that the Eleventh District in Bass \u201cexplicitly\u201d \nrejected anything, it was the \u201creverse discrimination\u201d \nlabel.  See Bass, 256 F.3d at 1102\u201303.  Its decision, in \nthat respect, was little more than an uncontroversial \nrecognition that Title VII applies equally to all plain-\ntiffs.  See id.  And Smith, for its part, simply cited \nBass for the principle that a plaintiff need not show \n\u201cbackground circumstances\u201d that suggest discrimina-\ntion.  See 644 F.3d at 1325 n.15.  But if Bass did not \ndecide that question, then neither can it be said did \nSmith. \nDicta aside, the legal test that the Eleventh Cir-\ncuit applied in Smith is, in practice, functionally sim-\nilar to the test that other circuits apply.  It held that \na plaintiff can prevail on a discrimination claim if \n\u201cthe record, viewed in a light most favorable to the \nplaintiff, presents \u2018a convincing mosaic of circum-\nstantial evidence that would allow a jury to infer in-\ntentional discrimination by the decisionmaker.\u2019\u201d  \n\n28 \n \nSmith, 644 F.3d at 1328.  And in other cases, the \nEleventh Circuit has held that its \u201cmosaic\u201d standard \naddresses the same question as \u201cwhen using the \nMcDonnell Douglas framework.\u201d  Tynes v. Fla. Dep\u2019t \nof Juvenile Justice, 88 F.4th 939, 947 (2023).  To be \nsure, some members of the Eleventh Circuit would go \neven further and would abandon McDonnell Douglas \ncompletely.  See id. at 949\u201358 (Newsome, J., concur-\nring).  But whether McDonnell Douglas has outlived \nits usefulness is a question that must wait for anoth-\ner day\u2014and for a party to raise it.  Ames has explic-\nitly declined to do so here.  See Pet.28 n.3. \n3. \nThe First, Second, Fourth, \nFifth, and Ninth Circuits \napply a largely similar prima \nfacie standard. \nAmes identifies two different categories of circuits \nthat, she claims, have implicitly rejected a back-\nground circumstances requirement: those that have \ndeclined to decide whether to apply such a require-\nment and those that have been entirely silent on the \nquestion.  See Pet.22\u201323.   \na. The Second, Fourth, and Ninth Circuits are in \nthe first category of cases.  They have acknowledged \nthe \u201cbackground circumstances\u201d requirement but \nhave not decided whether such a requirement should \nbe part of the prima facie test for \u201creverse\u201d discrimi-\nnation claims.  The fact that they have not taken a \nposition on the Question Presented means, by defini-\ntion, that they are not part of any circuit split.  That \nbeing said, however, the test that those circuits have \napplied is not meaningfully different from the test \nthat other circuits apply.  Like the Sixth, Seventh, \nEighth, Tenth, and D.C. Circuits, the Second, \n\n29 \n \nFourth, and Ninth Circuits all ask whether a plain-\ntiff has pointed to facts that would suggest the pres-\nence of discrimination. \nRather than linger on the framing of the \u201cback-\nground circumstances\u201d requirement, the Second Cir-\ncuit has focused on the ultimate question that \nMcDonnell Douglas was designed to address.  The \nrelevant question for any discrimination claim, it has \nnoted, is whether the events that give rise to a plain-\ntiff\u2019s complaint occurred \u201cunder circumstances which \ngive rise to an inference of unlawful discrimination.\u201d  \nAulicino v. New York Dep\u2019t of Homeless Servs., 580 \nF.3d 73, 80 (2d Cir. 2009) (quotation omitted).  In the \n\u201cconflict\u201d case that Ames cites, the Second Circuit \nheld that it did not need to decide whether to de-\nmand evidence of \u201cbackground circumstances\u201d be-\ncause the plaintiff\u2019s evidence sufficiently demon-\nstrated those circumstances, even if that require-\nment applied.  Id. at 80 n.5.   \nThe Fourth Circuit has adopted a similar ap-\nproach.  It has held that plaintiffs in all discrimina-\ntion cases must point to \u201csome evidence that race \nwas a determining factor in the employer\u2019s decision.\u201d  \nHolmes v. Bevilacqua, 794 F.2d 142, 147 (4th 1986) \n(en banc).  And while it has \u201cexpressly decline[d] to \ndecide \u2026 whether a higher burden\u201d applies to plain-\ntiffs who bring a \u201creverse\u201d discrimination claim, it \nhas held that the burden that its precedent calls for \nis not meaningfully different from the standard that \nthe D.C. Circuit discussed in Parker.  Lucas v. Dole, \n835 F.2d 532, 533\u201334 & n.9 (4th Cir. 1987) (emphasis \nadded). \nFinally, the Ninth Circuit fits into this category \nas well.  In an unpublished decision, it also chose not \n\n30 \n \nto weigh in on how the first component of the \nMcDonnell Douglas prima facie test should be modi-\nfied when faced with a \u201creverse\u201d discrimination \nclaim.  Zottola v. City of Oakland, 32 F. App\u2019x 307, \n311 (9th Cir. 2002).  The plaintiff\u2019s claim in that case, \nthe court held, failed with or without a \u201cbackground \ncircumstances\u201d requirement.  Id. at 311.  The only \nother Ninth Circuit decision that Ames cites also did \nnot address the Question Presented here.  The court \nin that case asked the same question that all other \ncircuits ask: did the plaintiffs provide evidence that \n\u201cgives rise to an inference of unlawful discrimina-\ntion\u201d?  See Hawn v. Exec. Jet Mgmt., 615 F.3d 1151, \n1156 (9th Cir. 2010) (quotation omitted). \nb. The First and Fifth Circuits belong to the sec-\nond category of circuits that Ames identifies: those \nthat have not discussed the \u201cbackground circum-\nstances\u201d element at all.  Like the circuits that have \nexpressly declined to decide whether or how to adjust \nMcDonnell Douglas\u2019s prima facie elements to account \nfor \u201creverse\u201d discrimination claims, the silence of the \nFirst and Fifth Circuits means that they cannot be \nproperly said to conflict with the other circuits.  And \neven though the First and Fifth Circuits have not \naddressed whether a \u201cbackground circumstances\u201d el-\nement is part of the prima facie test for \u201creverse\u201d dis-\ncrimination claims, the legal standard that they ap-\nply is still consistent with the standard that courts \nthat have adopted such a component apply.   \nThe First Circuit in Williams v. Raytheon Co., 220 \nF.3d 16 (1st Cir. 2000), for example, stated that the \nburden of establishing a prima facie case under \nMcDonnell Douglas is \u201cnot onerous.\u201d  Id. at 19.  To \nthe extent that the First Circuit did not discuss the \n\n31 \n \ncomponents of the prima facie test in greater detail, \nthat is because, after briefly discussing those ele-\nments, it largely \u201cput[] aside\u201d those elements and \u201cas \n[it has] often done,\u201d turned \u201cto whether there is evi-\ndence that, notwithstanding the employer\u2019s stated \nreasons for the termination, the real reason, at least \nin part, was \u2026 discrimination.\u201d  See Fontanez-Nunez \nv. Janssen Ortho, LLC, 447 F.3d 50, 56 (1st Cir. \n2006) (quotation omitted).  That is, it focused on the \nquestion of pretext.  Having done so, it held that the \nplaintiff\u2019s claim failed because his evidence did not \n\u201csupport a reasonable inference that [the employer] \nacted out of a discriminatory purpose.\u201d  Williams, \n220 F.3d at 20. \n The Fifth Circuit\u2019s approach in Byers v. Dallas \nMorning News, Inc., 209 F.3d 419 (5th Cir. 2000) is \nsimilar.  Like the First Circuit in Williams, it also \ndid not discuss a \u201cbackground circumstances\u201d ap-\nproach to the prima facie test like the one that some \ncircuits have used.  See id. 425\u201327.  It asked instead \nwhether the plaintiff had carried his burden of pro-\nducing \u201csufficient evidence indirectly demonstrating \ndiscriminatory intent.\u201d  Id. at 427.  The plaintiff in \nWilliams had not done so, the Fifth Circuit held, be-\ncause the only evidence of discrimination he had of-\nfered was \u201chis subjective belief.\u201d  Id.  The Fifth Cir-\ncuit\u2019s requirement that a plaintiff introduce enough \nindirect evidence to suggest a discriminatory motive \nis not meaningfully different from the \u201cbackground \ncircumstances\u201d requirement that other circuits have \nadopted.  The main difference is the label that those \ncircuits have assigned to that element of the prima \nfacie test. \n\n32 \n \nC. \nDistrict court uncertainty is not a \nreason to grant Ames\u2019s petition for \na writ of certiorari. \nHaving failed to make a compelling case that the \ncircuits are divided in a way that meaningfully af-\nfects the outcome of Title VII cases, Ames turns to \nthe district courts.  But even if she is right that some \ndistrict courts are confused about how to apply \nMcDonnell Douglas\u2019s test to \u201creverse\u201d discrimination \nclaims, the remedy for that confusion is further re-\nview in the circuit courts.  Those courts, not this one, \nare best suited to resolve any district court uncer-\ntainty or disagreement.  See Stephen Shapiro, et al., \nSupreme Court Practice, 505 (10th ed. 2013) (federal \ndistrict court conflicts \u201ccan be eliminated by the \ncourts of appeals\u201d); see also S. Ct. Prac. R. 10 (focus-\ning on United States courts of appeals decisions \nwhen considering whether certiorari is warranted).   \n* \n* \n* \nAt bottom, the circuits\u2019 slight variations in ap-\nproaching \u201creverse\u201d discrimination claims involves \nan almost-never-dispositive difference that largely \nboils down to differing verbal formulations.  And \nthose differences cropped up decades ago.  If this is a \nsplit at all, it is stale and largely irrelevant.    \nIII. \nThe Sixth Circuit faithfully applied this \nCourt\u2019s precedent when it held that Ames \nhad not made out a prima facie case of \ndiscrimination. \nRegardless of whether a circuit split exists, the \nSixth Circuit faithfully applies this Court\u2019s precedent \nwhen reviewing Title VII claims.  It has recognized \nthat \u201cTitle VII, of course, prohibits racial discrimina-\n\n33 \n \ntion against all groups.\u201d  Thistledown Racing, 770 \nF.2d at 67 (citing McDonald, 427 U.S. at 276, 279 \n(1976)).  The \u201cbackground circumstances\u201d element \nthat it applies to \u201creverse\u201d discrimination claims re-\nflects this Court\u2019s own focus on whether a plaintiff\u2019s \nallegations \u201c\u2018if otherwise unexplained, are more like-\nly than not based on the consideration of impermis-\nsible factors.\u2019\u201d  Burdine, 450 U.S. at 254 (quoting \nFurnco, 438 U.S. at 577).  And just like this Court \nhas held that McDonnell Douglas\u2019s prima facie \nstandard \u201cwas \u2018never intended to be rigid, mecha-\nnized, or ritualistic,\u2019\u201d Aikens, 460 U.S. at 715, the \nSixth Circuit has recognized that its \u201cbackground \ncircumstances\u201d requirement is \u201cnot onerous\u201d and \nmay be satisfied \u201cthrough a variety of means,\u201d John-\nson, 502 F. App\u2019x at 536. \nTo the extent that the panel\u2019s decision in this case \ncan be read as inflexibly applying a \u201cbackground cir-\ncumstances\u201d requirement, that is likely because of \nthe way Ames chose to litigate her appeal.  She did \nnot challenge the \u201cbackground circumstances\u201d re-\nquirement in any way and, by arguing that she had \ndemonstrated background circumstances, implicitly \naccepted it.  See, Ames Br., App.R.21 at 17\u201320.  In \ndoing so, she offered two reasons why background \ncircumstances existed: the identity of the deci-\nsionmaker (an argument that the panel held she had \nforfeited, see Pet.App.6a) and her own experiences.  \nSee id.  The fact that the panel focused solely on \nthose elements shows only that it engaged with \nAmes\u2019s arguments and wanted to succinctly dispose \nof her claims.  That the panel did not more thorough-\nly discuss an issue that neither of the parties had \nraised is, at most, a drafting issue that does not cre-\n\n34 \n \nate a circuit split\u2014let alone warrant this Court\u2019s re-\nview. \nThis case shows why all plaintiffs, including those \nwho bring \u201creverse\u201d discrimination claims, must \nmake some threshold showing that suggests discrim-\nination.  And it shows why, even if the circuit split \nthat Ames purports to identify exists, there is no \nmeaningful split about the outcome of this case.  The \nacid test for cert-worthiness is whether a case would \ncome out different in different circuits.  This case \nwould not.  \nAmes\u2019s evidence in this case was this: She was a \nwoman who did not receive a job for which she quali-\nfied and to which she had applied.  Walburn, one of \nthe individuals who was responsible for hiring for \nthat job, was also a woman.  And the person who was \nultimately hired for the job was also a woman\u2014and \nwas qualified for the position.  The woman who was \nhired was gay, however, and Ames was not.   \nAmes did not identify any evidence that suggest-\ned sexual orientation played any role in the hiring \ndecision, however.  She did not point to any evidence \nindicating that the relevant decisionmakers were \ngay.  Nor did she point to any evidence suggesting \nthat the decisionmakers knew the sexual orientation \nof either Ames or of the woman that they ultimately \nhired.  She instead conceded in the district court that \nthe Department\u2019s statement of the facts was correct.  \nSee Opposition to Motion for Summary Judgment, \nR.72, PageID#2488 n.1.  Without such evidence, \nthere is nothing that \u201craises an inference of discrimi-\nnation \u2026 if otherwise unexplained.\u201d  See Burdine, \n450 U.S. at 254 (quotation omitted).  Thus, under \nany formulation of McDonnell Douglas\u2019s prima facie \n\n35 \n \ntest, Ames\u2019s claim would fail.  If the Court were to \nhold otherwise, and if it were to hold that Ames es-\ntablished a prima facie case of discrimination in this \ncase anyway, then McDonnell Douglas\u2019s prima facie \nscreening test will have lost almost all of its mean-\ning.  \nCONCLUSION \nThe Court should deny the petition for a writ of \ncertiorari.  \n \nRespectfully submitted, \n \nDAVE YOST \nAttorney General of Ohio \nMICHAEL J.

          "task_beliefs": "This observation, being a reflection of my own internal reasoning, does not introduce new external evidence about the case. Therefore, my task-level beliefs remain stable, solidifying the significant update from the previous observation.\n\n*   **Case Status (Stable):** The Supreme Court granted certiorari on October 4, 2024. The central task is to predict the outcome on the merits.\n*   **Core Legal Question (Stable):** The question remains whether a plaintiff from a \"majority\" group must prove \"background circumstances suggesting that the defendant is the unusual employer who discriminates against the majority\" to establish a prima facie case under Title VII.\n*   **Petitioner's Merits Arguments (Stable):** My understanding of the petitioner's case is unchanged. The arguments are:\n    1.  **Textual & Precedential Conflict:** The \"background circumstances\" test is a judicial invention that contradicts the plain text of Title VII protecting \"any individual.\" It imposes a heightened burden that violates the principle of equal standards for all plaintiffs established in *McDonald v. Santa Fe Trail* and the individual-focused logic of *Bostock v. Clayton County*.\n    2.  **Administrative Disagreement:** The test is contrary to decades of EEOC policy, which applies a uniform standard of proof.\n    3.  **Unworkability:** The standard is vague and forces courts into difficult and inappropriate sociological inquiries about what constitutes a \"majority\" or \"minority\" in any given context.\n*   **Ideological Framing (Stable):** The petitioner's arguments are firmly rooted in textualism and formal equality, explicitly referencing the Court's recent decision in *Students for Fair Admissions, Inc. v. Pres. & Fellows of Harv. Coll. (SFFA)*. This positions the case perfectly for the current Court's majority.\n*   **Prediction (Stable):** My prediction remains a **high probability of reversal**. The \"background circumstances\" test appears to be precisely the kind of non-textual, judge-made gloss on a statute that the current Court is predisposed to eliminate. The petitioner's arguments align directly with the majority's preferred jurisprudential methods.\n*   **Information Gap (Clarified & Prioritized):** This period of reflection confirms that the single most important piece of missing information is the **Respondent's Merits Brief**. Understanding how the Ohio Department of Youth Services defends the \"background circumstances\" test is now the critical path to refining my prediction and assessing any potential for an outcome other than reversal.",
          "design_beliefs": "This observation, an explicit act of meta-cognition, does not introduce new external data but powerfully reinforces the importance of the internal DBOED process itself. It demonstrates the value of pausing to synthesize information, identify critical uncertainties, and plan the next action.\n\n**Foundational & Tactical Heuristics (Stable and Reinforced):**\nMy core heuristics (#1-15) remain valid.\n\n**Meta-Heuristics (Reinforced and Refined):**\n*   **18. Quarantine and Extract from Anomalous Data (Reinforced):** The `THINK` action explicitly acknowledges the value derived from the previous anomalous result, cementing this as a core principle.\n*   **19. The Principle of Foundational Document Precedence (Reinforced):** My internal reasoning explicitly incorporates the refined version of this rule: the \"foundational\" document is context-dependent and shifts with the case's procedural posture.\n*   **20. The Heuristic of Retrieval Resilience (Reinforced):** The reflection on the previous failure reinforces the need for a more sophisticated approach to search, acknowledging that simple query broadening is insufficient.\n*   **21. The DBOED Loop: From Failure to Heuristic to Action (Reinforced):** This `THINK` action is a perfect embodiment of the DBOED loop. It serves as the cognitive \"glue\" connecting the analysis of a past action to the design of a future one.\n\n**New & Refined Design Beliefs (Learned from this Observation):**\n*   **22. The Principle of Document Verification and Semantic Drift (Stable):** This principle, learned from the prior observation, is now a stable part of my methodology and informed the planning articulated in this `THINK` step.\n*   **23. The Value of \"Near Miss\" Data (Stable):** This principle is also now stable and was central to the reasoning process observed in this action.\n*   **24. The Heuristic of Strategic Recapitulation (New):** This observation demonstrates the value of a new, explicit heuristic. I must periodically pause direct information-gathering to execute a `THINK` action. The purpose of this action is to: 1) summarize the current state of task beliefs (\u03b8), 2) explicitly identify the most critical information gap that is driving uncertainty, and 3) design the next information-gathering action to be maximally informative with respect to that specific gap. This makes the experimental design process more deliberate, efficient, and transparent."

          "task_beliefs": "This observation provided the Respondent's Brief in Opposition (BIO) to the petition for certiorari, not the Merits Brief I was seeking. This is a crucial distinction, as the BIO's purpose is to persuade the Court *not* to hear the case, while a merits brief argues the case's substance after it has been accepted. This document provides a powerful insight into the Respondent's core defensive strategy.\n\n*   **Case Status (Stable):** The Supreme Court granted certiorari on October 4, 2024. The fact that the Court granted cert *despite* the arguments in this BIO is itself a significant signal.\n*   **Core Legal Question (Stable):** The question remains whether a \"majority\" plaintiff must show \"background circumstances\" to establish a prima facie case under Title VII.\n*   **Petitioner's Merits Arguments (Stable):** My understanding of the petitioner's textualist and formal equality arguments, grounded in *McDonald* and *Bostock*, remains unchanged.\n*   **Respondent's Arguments (Newly Discovered & Critical):** I now have the Respondent's pre-certiorari arguments. Their strategy is not to defend the \"background circumstances\" test on the merits, but to attack the case itself as a \"poor vehicle\" for deciding the question. Their key arguments are:\n    1.  **Forfeiture:** The Respondent's lead argument is that Ames never challenged the validity of the \"background circumstances\" test in the lower courts. Instead, she argued that she had *satisfied* the test. The Supreme Court is generally reluctant to decide questions that were not properly raised and argued below.\n    2.  **Outcome-Irrelevance:** The Respondent argues that even if the Court sides with Ames on the Question Presented, the final judgment would not change.\n        *   Her **demotion claim** was rejected by the Sixth Circuit on a separate, unchallenged ground: she failed to show the employer's reasons were pretextual (the third step of the *McDonnell Douglas* framework).\n        *   Her **promotion claim** would allegedly fail anyway because she lacked evidence for a *different* part of the prima facie case (that the decision-makers knew her sexual orientation).\n    3.  **Minimal Substantive Defense:** The BIO does not mount a robust defense of the \"background circumstances\" test. Instead, it characterizes the circuit split as a minor difference in \"language not law\" and argues all courts are trying to answer the same underlying question.\n    4.  **Candid Concession:** The BIO candidly points out that two Sixth Circuit judges (Boggs and Readler) have already signaled in another case (*Smyer v. Kroger*) that they believe *SFFA* has \"reset the table\" and that the \"background circumstances\" test should be eliminated, had the issue been properly preserved. This is a striking admission that the underlying law is weak, reinforcing the Respondent's strategy to focus exclusively on procedural defects.\n*   **Prediction (Updated & Complicated):** My previous prediction of a \"high probability of reversal\" is now more nuanced. The BIO's powerful vehicle arguments introduce a significant possibility of a **Dismissal as Improvidently Granted (DIG)**.\n    *   **If the Court reaches the merits:** The probability of reversal remains very high. The Respondent's lack of a substantive defense in the BIO, coupled with their concession about the views of lower court judges, suggests the \"background circumstances\" test is on very weak footing.\n    *   **Overall Disposition:** The probability of a DIG is now a major factor. The Court may have granted cert to address the issue but could still conclude, after full briefing and oral argument, that the forfeiture and outcome-irrelevance problems are too significant to overcome. This makes the final outcome more uncertain than before. The fact that the Court granted cert *over* these arguments is a point in the petitioner's favor, but it doesn't eliminate the DIG risk.\n*   **Information Gap (Stable & Refined):** The **Respondent's Merits Brief** remains the single most critical piece of missing information. I must see if they maintain their \"vehicle-only\" strategy or if they are forced to develop a substantive defense of the \"background circumstances\" test. Their choice will be a strong signal about how they interpret the Court's decision to grant certiorari in the face of their BIO.",
          "design_beliefs": "This observation was a \"successful failure.\" While I did not get the document I asked for, I received a different, highly valuable document that dramatically reshaped my understanding of the case's strategic landscape. This provides several key learnings for my design methodology.\n\n**Foundational & Tactical Heuristics (Stable and Reinforced):**\nMy core heuristics (#1-15) remain valid.\n\n**Meta-Heuristics (Reinforced and Refined):**\n*   **18-21 (Stable):** My meta-heuristics regarding anomalous data, document precedence, retrieval resilience, and the DBOED loop remain stable and were implicitly used in this process.\n*   **22. The Principle of Document Verification and Semantic Drift (Strongly Reinforced):** This observation is a textbook example of this principle. I requested a \"Merits Brief\" but received a \"Brief in Opposition.\" These are procedurally distinct documents with different strategic aims. This failure highlights the absolute necessity of using precise, procedurally-aware terminology in legal research. My query was semantically plausible but procedurally premature.\n*   **23. The Value of \"Near Miss\" Data (Stable):** The system's ability to return the BIO (a \"near miss\" for my query) was incredibly valuable, demonstrating that even imperfect searches can yield high-utility information.\n*   **24. The Heuristic of Strategic Recapitulation (Reinforced):** The previous `THINK` action, which embodied this heuristic, directly led to this targeted (albeit imperfect) search. The success of the outcome validates the practice of pausing to synthesize, identify gaps, and plan the next action.\n\n**New & Refined Design Beliefs (Learned from this Observation):**\n*   **25. The \"Vehicle Problem\" Heuristic (New):** When a case presents a clean legal question that aligns with the Court's known jurisprudential leanings, the respondent's most potent strategy is often procedural, not substantive. I must actively search for \"vehicle problems\" like forfeiture, waiver, standing, or arguments that the case's outcome is predetermined by other issues. These can lead to a Dismissal as Improvidently Granted (DIG), a non-merits disposition that is easy to miss if one only analyzes the substantive law.\n*   **26. The Value of Pre-Merits Documents (New):** Briefs in Opposition are not mere procedural hurdles; they are high-value intelligence. They provide an early and often candid look at a party's core defensive strategy and reveal potential case weaknesses that will persist through the merits stage. I will now prioritize locating the BIO as a standard step in analyzing any SCOTUS case.\n*   **27. The Heuristic of Docket Search Precision (New):** My search query was flawed. A more effective strategy would be to search for documents filed *by a specific party* (e.g., the Respondent) or for specific document *types* known to exist at a given procedural stage (e.g., \"brief in opposition\"). I must refine my search actions to be more aware of the litigation timeline and its corresponding document types, rather than guessing at titles."

Title VII\u2019s pro-\ntections apply equally to everyone.  They apply with \nthe same force to members of minority and majority \ngroups.  McDonald v. Santa Fe Trail Transp. Co., \n427 U.S. 273, 278\u201379 (1976).  The Petition argues \nthat the circuits use differing approaches for majori-\nty- and minority-group plaintiffs for one subpart of \none step of one approach to evaluating employment-\ndiscrimination claims.  The Question Presented nev-\ner gets off the ground: Ames did not question the Cir-\ncuit\u2019s longstanding approach to the Question Pre-\nsented until this Court and, not only does the Ques-\ntion Presented does not make a difference to the out-\ncome of this case, it rarely makes a difference in any \ncase. \nPetitioner Marlean Ames never challenged the \nSixth Circuit\u2019s application of the so-called \u201cback-\nground circumstances\u201d approach to Title VII discrim-\nination claims for majority-group plaintiffs.  Her only \nargument below was that she had satisfied that re-\nquirement.  Ames should not be able to raise an ar-\ngument here that she never aired in the courts be-\nlow.  Ames\u2019s failure bears directly on this Court\u2019s re-\nview.  The Sixth Circuit has taken a nuanced ap-\nproach to the background circumstances element\u2014\nbut none of that nuance was relevant in light of the \nway that Ames presented her appeal.  Furthermore, \nat least two Sixth Circuit judges have indicated that \nthey view Students for Fair Admissions v. President \n& Fellows of Harvard College, 600 U.S. 181 (2023) as \n\n2 \n \nresetting the table for the Circuit\u2019s Title VII prece-\ndent, and would rule that way if the issue were \nproperly preserved.  See Smyer v. Kroger Ltd. P\u2019ship \nI, No. 22-3692, 2024 WL 1007116, at *8 (6th Cir. \nMar. 8, 2024) (Boggs, J., concurring); id. at *10 \n(Readler, J., concurring) (also noting that Ames did \nnot raise the Harvard decision). \nWhat is more, answering the Question Presented \nwill not change the outcome here.  Ames challenged \ntwo separate employment actions in the courts be-\nlow: the Department of Youth Services\u2019 failure to \npromote her and its decision to demote her and re-\nplace her with another employee.   \nThe Sixth Circuit held that Ames\u2019s demotion \nclaim failed at a later step of the familiar three-step \napproach to evaluating discrimination claims (see \nMcDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792 \n(1973)).  That employment decision, it held, involved \nno discriminatory motive.  Ames\u2019s Question Present-\ned does not challenge that aspect of the Sixth Cir-\ncuit\u2019s decision and she therefore can no longer chal-\nlenge the Sixth Circuit\u2019s conclusion that the demo-\ntion about which Ames complains was not discrimi-\nnatory.   \nAs for her promotion claim, Ames has affirmative-\nly waived any challenge to the requirement that she \nestablish a prima facie case of discrimination more \ngenerally.  See Pet.28 n.3.  And because she failed to \nintroduce any evidence that the decisionmakers who \nmade the employment decision that she challenges \nknew of her majority-group status (in this case her \nsexual orientation), Ames\u2019s promotion claim would \nhave failed at the prima facie stage even if the Sixth \nCircuit had not used the legal framework Ames chal-\n\n3 \n \nlenges.  What is more, Ames\u2019s claim that she was not \npromoted would also have failed at the next step of \nMcDonnell Douglas\u2019s analysis.  The Department had \nlegitimate, nondiscriminatory, reasons for hiring \nsomeone other than Ames, and Ames has not pointed \nto sufficient evidence to create a genuine issue of fact \nabout whether those reasons were pretextual.   \nEven without these vehicle flaws, the Court \nshould decline review.  Any divergence in how the \ncircuits approach the Question Presented is more \nform than substance; regardless of how each circuit \nspecifically describes its approach to the Question \nPresented, each circuit is focused on the same under-\nlying question.  Every circuit discussed in the Peti-\ntion asks, in one way or another, whether a plaintiff \nhas shown that an employer\u2019s actions, \u201c\u2018if otherwise \nunexplained,\u201d are \u201cmore likely than not based on the \nconsideration of impermissible factors.\u2019\u201d  Tex. Dep\u2019t of \nCmty. Affairs v. Burdine, 450 U.S. 248, 254 (1981) \n(quoting Furnco Constr. Corp. v. Waters, 438 U.S. \n567, 577 (1978)).  Put another way, all the circuits \nare ultimately trained on the question of what\u2014if \nanything\u2014gives rise to an inference that the plaintiff \nis the minority or the outsider in the context of the \nspecific employment decision the lawsuit challenges.  \nFinally, any difference between the circuits, whether \nin language or substance, arose decades ago.  Despite \nthe longevity of any substantive difference, the cir-\ncuit\u2019s varying formulations rarely, if ever change liti-\ngation outcomes.   \nSTATEMENT \nMarlean Ames worked for the Ohio Department \nof Youth Services in a variety of roles.  Pet.App3a.  \nShe was working as the Administrator of the De-\n\n4 \n \npartment\u2019s Prison Rape Elimination Act program \nwhen the Department created a new position, the \nBureau Chief of Quality Assurance and Improve-\nment.  Pet.App.18a.  Ames applied for the new posi-\ntion.  Id. \nThe Bureau Chief position was a management \nrole that was intended to supervise and guide the \nother members of the Office of Quality and Im-\nprovement.  Pet.App.19a.  Among the key skills that \nthe Department was looking for in a successful can-\ndidate were management, supervision, and workforce \nplanning.  Id.  Ames was one of three people who ap-\nplied for the Bureau Chief job.  Id.  None of them \nwere hired.  Pet.App.20a.  Because there was no \ntimeline for filling the position, the Department de-\ncided to wait to hire someone until an ideal candidate \ncould be found.  Id.   \nSix months after Ames had interviewed for the \nBureau Chief role, the Department hired Yolanda \nFrierson for the job.  Pet.App.20a.  Julie Walburn, \nthe assistant director of the Department, made the \ndecision to hire Frierson.  See Pet.App.18a, 20a\u201321a.  \nAlthough Frierson did not interview for the Bureau \nChief job, Walburn had worked with Frierson in the \npast.  Pet.App.21a.  Walburn felt that Frierson would \nbe a good fit for the role because, among other things, \nFrierson had significant management experience.  \nId.  Although Frierson and Ames were both women, \nFrierson, unlike Ames, was gay.  Id. \nNot long after Ames interviewed for the Bureau \nChief position, she was removed from her role admin-\nistering the Prison Rape Elimination Act program.  \nPet.App.4a.  When the Governor appointed a new Di-\nrector of the Department, he had stressed to that Di-\n\n5 \n \nrector, Ryan Gies, that addressing sexual victimiza-\ntion within the juvenile corrections system was a \nhigh priority.  See Pet.App.18a, 21a\u201322a.  Gies there-\nfore began restructuring the Department\u2019s programs.  \nPet.App.21a\u201322a.   \nIt was that restructuring that cost Ames her posi-\ntion.  Pet.App.22a.  Gies felt that Ames was difficult \nto work with.  Id.  And Walburn was concerned that \nAmes could not oversee a more proactive approach to \ncomplying with the Prison Rape Elimination Act.  Id.  \nAmes was reassigned to a different role within the \nDepartment, one that she had previously held and \nthat paid less, Pet.App.18a, and Alex Stojsavljevic \nwas selected to oversee the Prison Rape Elimination \nAct program, Pet.App.23a.  Stojsavljevic is a gay \nman.  See id. \nAmes filed a complaint with the Equal Opportuni-\nty Commission and received a right-to-sue letter.  \nPet.App.4a.  Ames then filed a complaint in federal \ndistrict court.  Id.  As is relevant here, Ames\u2019s com-\nplaint alleged that the Department discriminated \nagainst her on the basis of sexual orientation (which \nis a form of sex discrimination) when it hired Fri-\nerson for the Bureau Chief role (call this her \u201cpromo-\ntion claim\u201d) and that it discriminated against her on \nthe basis of both sex and sexual orientation when it \ndemoted her and replaced her with Stojsavljevic (call \nthis her \u201cdemotion claim\u201d).  Pet.App.5a, 6a.  The dis-\ntrict court granted summary judgment in the De-\npartment\u2019s favor on both claims, see Pet.App.33a, \n39a\u201340a, and the Sixth Circuit affirmed, Pet.App.3a. \nAmes\u2019s claim related to the Bureau Chief position \nfailed, the Sixth Circuit held, because Ames could not \nmake \na \nprima \nfacie \ncase \nof \ndiscrimination.  \n\n6 \n \nPet.App.5a\u20136a.  Under Sixth Circuit precedent, a \nmajority-group plaintiff like Ames must identify evi-\ndence that would \u201csupport the suspicion that the de-\nfendant is that unusual employer who discriminates \nagainst the majority.\u201d  Pet.App.5a (quoting Arendale \nv. City of Memphis, 519 F.3d 587, 603 (6th Cir. \n2008)).  Ames, the Sixth Circuit held, had not.  \nPet.App.5a\u20136a.  Ames conceded in the district court \nthat Walburn and Gies, neither of whom are gay, \nwere the ones who were responsible for hiring Fri-\nerson. see Opposition to Motion for Summary Judg-\nment, R.72, PageID#2488 n.1.  Ames attempted to \nwalk back that admission on appeal.  She argued in \nthe Sixth Circuit that she had demonstrated back-\nground circumstances of discrimination because a \ndifferent individual made the decision to hire Fri-\nerson and that individual was gay.  See Pet.App.6a.  \nThe Sixth Circuit held, however, that Ames\u2019s conces-\nsion in the district court meant that she had forfeited \nthat argument for purposes of appeal.  Id.   \nThe Sixth Circuit held that Ames\u2019s demotion \nclaim failed for the same reason, at least to the ex-\ntent that Ames alleged that the Department discrim-\ninated against her on the basis of her sexual orienta-\ntion when it replaced her with Stojsavljevic.  See \nPet.App.6a.  But because Ames had also alleged that \nthe Department discriminated against her on the ba-\nsis of sex when it demoted her and selected a man to \nfill her prior position, the Sixth Circuit considered \nthe Department\u2019s proffered reasons for that employ-\nment action.  Pet.App.6a\u20139a.  It held that Ames \nfailed to carry her burden of showing that the De-\npartment discriminated against her.  Id.  The De-\npartment, the Sixth Circuit held, had legitimate, \nnondiscriminatory, reasons for demoting Ames and \n\n7 \n \nhiring Stojsavljevic and Ames failed to introduce any \nevidence that would suggest that those reasons were \npretextual.  See id. \nJudge Kethledge concurred.  Although he joined \nthe opinion in full, he wrote that he disagreed with \nSixth Circuit precedent to the extent that it required \nAmes to show, as part of her prima facie case of sex-\nual-orientation discrimination, that the Department \n\u201cis the unusual employer that discriminates against \nthe majority.\u201d  Pet.App.9a (quotation omitted). \nAmes has now filed a petition for a writ of certio-\nrari in which she challenges the Sixth Circuit\u2019s prec-\nedent, which includes a \u201cbackground circumstances\u201d \ncomponent for employment-discrimination claims to \nproceed down the McDonnell Douglas path if the \nplaintiff is a member of a majority group.  That prec-\nedent required her to point to something that indi-\ncated that the Department was the unusual employ-\ner that discriminates against the majority.  See Pet.i.  \nBut the Question Presented does not challenge the \nportion of the Sixth Circuit\u2019s decision that held that \nthe Department had legitimate, nondiscriminatory \nreasons for demoting Ames and replacing her with \nStojsavljevic.  See, generally, Pet.   \nREASONS FOR DENYING THE PETITION \nI. \nThis case provides a poor vehicle with \nwhich to address the Question Presented. \nThis case has numerous vehicle problems that \nmake it a poor case in which to consider the Question \nPresented.  Any one of those problems provides a \nreason to deny Ames\u2019s petition for a writ of certiorari. \nThe context for these vehicle flaws includes both \nlegal and factual background. \n\n8 \n \nLegally, these flaws intersect with this Court\u2019s \nfrequently invoked tool for assessing discrimination \nclaims in McDonnell Douglas.  All Title VII plaintiffs, \nregardless of the group to which they belong, bear \nthe \u201cultimate burden of persuading the trier of fact \nthat \nthe \ndefendant \nintentionally \ndiscriminated \nagainst\u201d them.  Burdine, 450 U.S. at 253.  The Court \nin McDonnell Douglas adopted a three-step analysis \nto assist courts in reviewing Title VII claims.  At the \nfirst step, a plaintiff bears the burden of establishing \na prima facie case of discrimination.  411 U.S. at 802.  \nOnce she does so, the employer must offer a legiti-\nmate, nondiscriminatory, reason for its actions.  Id. \nat 802\u201303. The plaintiff then bears the burden of \nshowing that the employer\u2019s reasons were pretextual.  \nId. at 804.  McDonnell Douglas\u2019s test was \u201cnever in-\ntended to be rigid, mechanized, or ritualistic,\u201d how-\never; it was simply intended to be \u201ca sensible, orderly \nway to evaluate the evidence in light of common ex-\nperience as it bears on the critical question of dis-\ncrimination.\u201d  Furnco Constr. Corp. v. Waters, 438 \nU.S. 567, 577 (1978). \nFactually, these flaws intersect with Ames\u2019s two \nclaimed acts of employment discrimination.  Recall \nthat she initially challenged both the Department\u2019s \ndecision to promote a different person and the De-\npartment\u2019s decision to demote her when it picked a \ndifferent person to fill Ames\u2019s former role.  Ames \nchallenged the promotion decision as illegal sexual-\norientation discrimination and challenged the demo-\ntion decision as both illegal sex and sexual-\norientation discrimination.  And while the Sixth Cir-\ncuit affirmed judgment against Ames on her orienta-\ntion theories for failing the prima facie inquiry with \nrespect to both her promotion and demotion claims, it \n\n9 \n \naffirmed \njudgment \nagainst \nher \non \nthe \nsex-\ndiscrimination theory because Ames could not show \nany pretext in the Department\u2019s decision to demote \nher and to select someone to replace her at her for-\nmer position.  See Pet.App.7a\u20138a.  The Sixth Circuit, \nthat is, rejected Ames\u2019s claim that the Department \ndiscriminated against her when it demoted her.   \nIn this Court, Ames\u2019s Question Presented targets \nonly a component of the prima facie showing.  The \nconsequence of that choice is that Ames cannot chal-\nlenge the Department\u2019s decision to demote her be-\ncause she has not challenged the lower court\u2019s hold-\nings that the demotion decision involved no pretext \n(and thus no discrimination).    \nWith that legal and factual setting, the following \nfour vehicle flaws point against granting review. \nA. \nAmes did not challenge the Sixth \nCircuit\u2019s prima facie test below. \nAmes never challenged the Sixth Circuit\u2019s \u201cback-\nground circumstances\u201d element below.  She argued \ninstead that she satisfied that requirement.  While \nAmes\u2019s litigation strategy may not have forfeited her \nQuestion Presented in the strictest sense, it still \nmakes this case a poor vehicle with which to consider \nthat question. \nThe Court has indicated that parties need not al-\nways raise their arguments for the first time in the \ncircuit courts.  It has noted that there is no require-\nment that a \u201cparty demand overruling of a squarely \napplicable, recent circuit precedent, even though that \nprecedent was established in a case to which the par-\nty itself was privy and over the party\u2019s vigorous ob-\njection.\u201d  United States v. Williams, 504 U.S. 36, 44 \n\n10 \n \n(1992); see also United States v. Vonn, 535 U.S. 55, \n58 (2002).   \nEven if Ames was not required to challenge exist-\ning Sixth Circuit precedent, she at least should not \nbe able to benefit from her failure to do so.  But that, \nin effect, is what she seeks to do.  As discussed in \nmore detail below, the Sixth Circuit has taken a nu-\nanced approach to determining whether a majority-\ngroup plaintiff has identified background circum-\nstances that suggest discrimination.  See below at \n23\u201324, 33\u201335.  Among other things, it has held that \nthe \u201c[background circumstances] requirement is not \nonerous, and can be met through a variety of means.\u201d  \nJohnson v. Metro. Gov\u2019t of Nashville & Davidson \nCnty., 502 F. App\u2019x 523, 536 (6th Cir. 2012).  Had \nAmes argued that such a requirement is inconsistent \nwith Title VII, then the Sixth Circuit would have had \nthe opportunity to discuss its precedent in greater \ndetail.  It could have explained, for example, that the \n\u201cbackground circumstances\u201d requirement is not a \nhigher burden, merely a different one.  But because \nAmes did not raise that issue, the panel had no rea-\nson to reject her framing of the background circum-\nstances element of the prima\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

Title VII\u2019s pro-\ntections apply equally to everyone.  They apply with \nthe same force to members of minority and majority \ngroups.  McDonald v. Santa Fe Trail Transp. Co., \n427 U.S. 273, 278\u201379 (1976).  The Petition argues \nthat the circuits use differing approaches for majori-\nty- and minority-group plaintiffs for one subpart of \none step of one approach to evaluating employment-\ndiscrimination claims.  The Question Presented nev-\ner gets off the ground: Ames did not question the Cir-\ncuit\u2019s longstanding approach to the Question Pre-\nsented until this Court and, not only does the Ques-\ntion Presented does not make a difference to the out-\ncome of this case, it rarely makes a difference in any \ncase. \nPetitioner Marlean Ames never challenged the \nSixth Circuit\u2019s application of the so-called \u201cback-\nground circumstances\u201d approach to Title VII discrim-\nination claims for majority-group plaintiffs.  Her only \nargument below was that she had satisfied that re-\nquirement.  Ames should not be able to raise an ar-\ngument here that she never aired in the courts be-\nlow.  Ames\u2019s failure bears directly on this Court\u2019s re-\nview.  The Sixth Circuit has taken a nuanced ap-\nproach to the background circumstances element\u2014\nbut none of that nuance was relevant in light of the \nway that Ames presented her appeal.  Furthermore, \nat least two Sixth Circuit judges have indicated that \nthey view Students for Fair Admissions v. President \n& Fellows of Harvard College, 600 U.S. 181 (2023) as \n\n2 \n \nresetting the table for the Circuit\u2019s Title VII prece-\ndent, and would rule that way if the issue were \nproperly preserved.  See Smyer v. Kroger Ltd. P\u2019ship \nI, No. 22-3692, 2024 WL 1007116, at *8 (6th Cir. \nMar. 8, 2024) (Boggs, J., concurring); id. at *10 \n(Readler, J., concurring) (also noting that Ames did \nnot raise the Harvard decision). \nWhat is more, answering the Question Presented \nwill not change the outcome here.  Ames challenged \ntwo separate employment actions in the courts be-\nlow: the Department of Youth Services\u2019 failure to \npromote her and its decision to demote her and re-\nplace her with another employee.   \nThe Sixth Circuit held that Ames\u2019s demotion \nclaim failed at a later step of the familiar three-step \napproach to evaluating discrimination claims (see \nMcDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792 \n(1973)).  That employment decision, it held, involved \nno discriminatory motive.  Ames\u2019s Question Present-\ned does not challenge that aspect of the Sixth Cir-\ncuit\u2019s decision and she therefore can no longer chal-\nlenge the Sixth Circuit\u2019s conclusion that the demo-\ntion about which Ames complains was not discrimi-\nnatory.   \nAs for her promotion claim, Ames has affirmative-\nly waived any challenge to the requirement that she \nestablish a prima facie case of discrimination more \ngenerally.  See Pet.28 n.3.  And because she failed to \nintroduce any evidence that the decisionmakers who \nmade the employment decision that she challenges \nknew of her majority-group status (in this case her \nsexual orientation), Ames\u2019s promotion claim would \nhave failed at the prima facie stage even if the Sixth \nCircuit had not used the legal framework Ames chal-\n\n3 \n \nlenges.  What is more, Ames\u2019s claim that she was not \npromoted would also have failed at the next step of \nMcDonnell Douglas\u2019s analysis.  The Department had \nlegitimate, nondiscriminatory, reasons for hiring \nsomeone other than Ames, and Ames has not pointed \nto sufficient evidence to create a genuine issue of fact \nabout whether those reasons were pretextual.   \nEven without these vehicle flaws, the Court \nshould decline review.  Any divergence in how the \ncircuits approach the Question Presented is more \nform than substance; regardless of how each circuit \nspecifically describes its approach to the Question \nPresented, each circuit is focused on the same under-\nlying question.  Every circuit discussed in the Peti-\ntion asks, in one way or another, whether a plaintiff \nhas shown that an employer\u2019s actions, \u201c\u2018if otherwise \nunexplained,\u201d are \u201cmore likely than not based on the \nconsideration of impermissible factors.\u2019\u201d  Tex. Dep\u2019t of \nCmty. Affairs v. Burdine, 450 U.S. 248, 254 (1981) \n(quoting Furnco Constr. Corp. v. Waters, 438 U.S. \n567, 577 (1978)).  Put another way, all the circuits \nare ultimately trained on the question of what\u2014if \nanything\u2014gives rise to an inference that the plaintiff \nis the minority or the outsider in the context of the \nspecific employment decision the lawsuit challenges.  \nFinally, any difference between the circuits, whether \nin language or substance, arose decades ago.  Despite \nthe longevity of any substantive difference, the cir-\ncuit\u2019s varying formulations rarely, if ever change liti-\ngation outcomes.   \nSTATEMENT \nMarlean Ames worked for the Ohio Department \nof Youth Services in a variety of roles.  Pet.App3a.  \nShe was working as the Administrator of the De-\n\n4 \n \npartment\u2019s Prison Rape Elimination Act program \nwhen the Department created a new position, the \nBureau Chief of Quality Assurance and Improve-\nment.  Pet.App.18a.  Ames applied for the new posi-\ntion.  Id. \nThe Bureau Chief position was a management \nrole that was intended to supervise and guide the \nother members of the Office of Quality and Im-\nprovement.  Pet.App.19a.  Among the key skills that \nthe Department was looking for in a successful can-\ndidate were management, supervision, and workforce \nplanning.  Id.  Ames was one of three people who ap-\nplied for the Bureau Chief job.  Id.  None of them \nwere hired.  Pet.App.20a.  Because there was no \ntimeline for filling the position, the Department de-\ncided to wait to hire someone until an ideal candidate \ncould be found.  Id.   \nSix months after Ames had interviewed for the \nBureau Chief role, the Department hired Yolanda \nFrierson for the job.  Pet.App.20a.  Julie Walburn, \nthe assistant director of the Department, made the \ndecision to hire Frierson.  See Pet.App.18a, 20a\u201321a.  \nAlthough Frierson did not interview for the Bureau \nChief job, Walburn had worked with Frierson in the \npast.  Pet.App.21a.  Walburn felt that Frierson would \nbe a good fit for the role because, among other things, \nFrierson had significant management experience.  \nId.  Although Frierson and Ames were both women, \nFrierson, unlike Ames, was gay.  Id. \nNot long after Ames interviewed for the Bureau \nChief position, she was removed from her role admin-\nistering the Prison Rape Elimination Act program.  \nPet.App.4a.  When the Governor appointed a new Di-\nrector of the Department, he had stressed to that Di-\n\n5 \n \nrector, Ryan Gies, that addressing sexual victimiza-\ntion within the juvenile corrections system was a \nhigh priority.  See Pet.App.18a, 21a\u201322a.  Gies there-\nfore began restructuring the Department\u2019s programs.  \nPet.App.21a\u201322a.   \nIt was that restructuring that cost Ames her posi-\ntion.  Pet.App.22a.  Gies felt that Ames was difficult \nto work with.  Id.  And Walburn was concerned that \nAmes could not oversee a more proactive approach to \ncomplying with the Prison Rape Elimination Act.  Id.  \nAmes was reassigned to a different role within the \nDepartment, one that she had previously held and \nthat paid less, Pet.App.18a, and Alex Stojsavljevic \nwas selected to oversee the Prison Rape Elimination \nAct program, Pet.App.23a.  Stojsavljevic is a gay \nman.  See id. \nAmes filed a complaint with the Equal Opportuni-\nty Commission and received a right-to-sue letter.  \nPet.App.4a.  Ames then filed a complaint in federal \ndistrict court.  Id.  As is relevant here, Ames\u2019s com-\nplaint alleged that the Department discriminated \nagainst her on the basis of sexual orientation (which \nis a form of sex discrimination) when it hired Fri-\nerson for the Bureau Chief role (call this her \u201cpromo-\ntion claim\u201d) and that it discriminated against her on \nthe basis of both sex and sexual orientation when it \ndemoted her and replaced her with Stojsavljevic (call \nthis her \u201cdemotion claim\u201d).  Pet.App.5a, 6a.  The dis-\ntrict court granted summary judgment in the De-\npartment\u2019s favor on both claims, see Pet.App.33a, \n39a\u201340a, and the Sixth Circuit affirmed, Pet.App.3a. \nAmes\u2019s claim related to the Bureau Chief position \nfailed, the Sixth Circuit held, because Ames could not \nmake \na \nprima \nfacie \ncase \nof \ndiscrimination.  \n\n6 \n \nPet.App.5a\u20136a.  Under Sixth Circuit precedent, a \nmajority-group plaintiff like Ames must identify evi-\ndence that would \u201csupport the suspicion that the de-\nfendant is that unusual employer who discriminates \nagainst the majority.\u201d  Pet.App.5a (quoting Arendale \nv. City of Memphis, 519 F.3d 587, 603 (6th Cir. \n2008)).  Ames, the Sixth Circuit held, had not.  \nPet.App.5a\u20136a.  Ames conceded in the district court \nthat Walburn and Gies, neither of whom are gay, \nwere the ones who were responsible for hiring Fri-\nerson. see Opposition to Motion for Summary Judg-\nment, R.72, PageID#2488 n.1.  Ames attempted to \nwalk back that admission on appeal.  She argued in \nthe Sixth Circuit that she had demonstrated back-\nground circumstances of discrimination because a \ndifferent individual made the decision to hire Fri-\nerson and that individual was gay.  See Pet.App.6a.  \nThe Sixth Circuit held, however, that Ames\u2019s conces-\nsion in the district court meant that she had forfeited \nthat argument for purposes of appeal.  Id.   \nThe Sixth Circuit held that Ames\u2019s demotion \nclaim failed for the same reason, at least to the ex-\ntent that Ames alleged that the Department discrim-\ninated against her on the basis of her sexual orienta-\ntion when it replaced her with Stojsavljevic.  See \nPet.App.6a.  But because Ames had also alleged that \nthe Department discriminated against her on the ba-\nsis of sex when it demoted her and selected a man to \nfill her prior position, the Sixth Circuit considered \nthe Department\u2019s proffered reasons for that employ-\nment action.  Pet.App.6a\u20139a.  It held that Ames \nfailed to carry her burden of showing that the De-\npartment discriminated against her.  Id.  The De-\npartment, the Sixth Circuit held, had legitimate, \nnondiscriminatory, reasons for demoting Ames and \n\n7 \n \nhiring Stojsavljevic and Ames failed to introduce any \nevidence that would suggest that those reasons were \npretextual.  See id. \nJudge Kethledge concurred.  Although he joined \nthe opinion in full, he wrote that he disagreed with \nSixth Circuit precedent to the extent that it required \nAmes to show, as part of her prima facie case of sex-\nual-orientation discrimination, that the Department \n\u201cis the unusual employer that discriminates against \nthe majority.\u201d  Pet.App.9a (quotation omitted). \nAmes has now filed a petition for a writ of certio-\nrari in which she challenges the Sixth Circuit\u2019s prec-\nedent, which includes a \u201cbackground circumstances\u201d \ncomponent for employment-discrimination claims to \nproceed down the McDonnell Douglas path if the \nplaintiff is a member of a majority group.  That prec-\nedent required her to point to something that indi-\ncated that the Department was the unusual employ-\ner that discriminates against the majority.  See Pet.i.  \nBut the Question Presented does not challenge the \nportion of the Sixth Circuit\u2019s decision that held that \nthe Department had legitimate, nondiscriminatory \nreasons for demoting Ames and replacing her with \nStojsavljevic.  See, generally, Pet.   \nREASONS FOR DENYING THE PETITION \nI. \nThis case provides a poor vehicle with \nwhich to address the Question Presented. \nThis case has numerous vehicle problems that \nmake it a poor case in which to consider the Question \nPresented.  Any one of those problems provides a \nreason to deny Ames\u2019s petition for a writ of certiorari. \nThe context for these vehicle flaws includes both \nlegal and factual background. \n\n8 \n \nLegally, these flaws intersect with this Court\u2019s \nfrequently invoked tool for assessing discrimination \nclaims in McDonnell Douglas.  All Title VII plaintiffs, \nregardless of the group to which they belong, bear \nthe \u201cultimate burden of persuading the trier of fact \nthat \nthe \ndefendant \nintentionally \ndiscriminated \nagainst\u201d them.  Burdine, 450 U.S. at 253.  The Court \nin McDonnell Douglas adopted a three-step analysis \nto assist courts in reviewing Title VII claims.  At the \nfirst step, a plaintiff bears the burden of establishing \na prima facie case of discrimination.  411 U.S. at 802.  \nOnce she does so, the employer must offer a legiti-\nmate, nondiscriminatory, reason for its actions.  Id. \nat 802\u201303. The plaintiff then bears the burden of \nshowing that the employer\u2019s reasons were pretextual.  \nId. at 804.  McDonnell Douglas\u2019s test was \u201cnever in-\ntended to be rigid, mechanized, or ritualistic,\u201d how-\never; it was simply intended to be \u201ca sensible, orderly \nway to evaluate the evidence in light of common ex-\nperience as it bears on the critical question of dis-\ncrimination.\u201d  Furnco Constr. Corp. v. Waters, 438 \nU.S. 567, 577 (1978). \nFactually, these flaws intersect with Ames\u2019s two \nclaimed acts of employment discrimination.  Recall \nthat she initially challenged both the Department\u2019s \ndecision to promote a different person and the De-\npartment\u2019s decision to demote her when it picked a \ndifferent person to fill Ames\u2019s former role.  Ames \nchallenged the promotion decision as illegal sexual-\norientation discrimination and challenged the demo-\ntion decision as both illegal sex and sexual-\norientation discrimination.  And while the Sixth Cir-\ncuit affirmed judgment against Ames on her orienta-\ntion theories for failing the prima facie inquiry with \nrespect to both her promotion and demotion claims, it \n\n9 \n \naffirmed \njudgment \nagainst \nher \non \nthe \nsex-\ndiscrimination theory because Ames could not show \nany pretext in the Department\u2019s decision to demote \nher and to select someone to replace her at her for-\nmer position.  See Pet.App.7a\u20138a.  The Sixth Circuit, \nthat is, rejected Ames\u2019s claim that the Department \ndiscriminated against her when it demoted her.   \nIn this Court, Ames\u2019s Question Presented targets \nonly a component of the prima facie showing.  The \nconsequence of that choice is that Ames cannot chal-\nlenge the Department\u2019s decision to demote her be-\ncause she has not challenged the lower court\u2019s hold-\nings that the demotion decision involved no pretext \n(and thus no discrimination).    \nWith that legal and factual setting, the following \nfour vehicle flaws point against granting review. \nA. \nAmes did not challenge the Sixth \nCircuit\u2019s prima facie test below. \nAmes never challenged the Sixth Circuit\u2019s \u201cback-\nground circumstances\u201d element below.  She argued \ninstead that she satisfied that requirement.  While \nAmes\u2019s litigation strategy may not have forfeited her \nQuestion Presented in the strictest sense, it still \nmakes this case a poor vehicle with which to consider \nthat question. \nThe Court has indicated that parties need not al-\nways raise their arguments for the first time in the \ncircuit courts.  It has noted that there is no require-\nment that a \u201cparty demand overruling of a squarely \napplicable, recent circuit precedent, even though that \nprecedent was established in a case to which the par-\nty itself was privy and over the party\u2019s vigorous ob-\njection.\u201d  United States v. Williams, 504 U.S. 36, 44 \n\n10 \n \n(1992); see also United States v. Vonn, 535 U.S. 55, \n58 (2002).   \nEven if Ames was not required to challenge exist-\ning Sixth Circuit precedent, she at least should not \nbe able to benefit from her failure to do so.  But that, \nin effect, is what she seeks to do.  As discussed in \nmore detail below, the Sixth Circuit has taken a nu-\nanced approach to determining whether a majority-\ngroup plaintiff has identified background circum-\nstances that suggest discrimination.  See below at \n23\u201324, 33\u201335.  Among other things, it has held that \nthe \u201c[background circumstances] requirement is not \nonerous, and can be met through a variety of means.\u201d  \nJohnson v. Metro. Gov\u2019t of Nashville & Davidson \nCnty., 502 F. App\u2019x 523, 536 (6th Cir. 2012).  Had \nAmes argued that such a requirement is inconsistent \nwith Title VII, then the Sixth Circuit would have had \nthe opportunity to discuss its precedent in greater \ndetail.  It could have explained, for example, that the \n\u201cbackground circumstances\u201d requirement is not a \nhigher burden, merely a different one.  But because \nAmes did not raise that issue, the panel had no rea-\nson to reject her framing of the background circum-\nstances element of the prima facie test.  Put another \nway, one of the reasons that Ames is now able to crit-\nicize the decision below as overly stringent and in-\nflexible is because she herself framed it that way.  \nAnd while that is not waiver or forfeiture formally, \nthe fact that Ames \u201cdid not raise or brief\u201d the ques-\ntion presented \u201cbelow\u201d is a reason to deny certiorari.  \nHoggard v. Rhodes, 141 S. Ct. 2421, 2422 (2021) \n(Thomas, J., respecting the denial of certiorari). \n\n11 \n \nB. \nAnswering the Question Presented \nin Ames\u2019s favor would not change \nthe outcome in this case because \nAmes cannot satisfy a separate \ncomponent of the prima facie \nshowing. \nAmes has affirmatively waived any challenge to \nthe requirement that she establish a prima facie case \nof discrimination.  Pet.28 n.3.  Her only challenge is \nto how the Sixth Circuit applied one component of \nthat rubric in this case.  Ames\u2019s Question Presented \nasks whether, to establish a prima facie case of dis-\ncrimination under Title VII, a majority-group plain-\ntiff must introduce evidence of \u201cbackground circum-\nstances\u201d that suggest discrimination.  See Pet.i.  But \nthe answer to that question will not affect the out-\ncome of this case.  Even if the answer is \u201cno\u201d Ames \nstill could not make a prima facie case of sex discrim-\nination.  And that is a prime reason to deny certiora-\nri.  The Court should \u201cnot ... take up\u201d a question pre-\nsented if the claims underlying that question are \u201cin-\ndependently subject to\u201d defenses that would yield the \nsame result regardless of how the Court answers the \nquestion.  Blankenship v. NBCUniversal, LLC, 144 S. \nCt. 5, 6 (2023) (Thomas, J., concurring in the denial \nof certiorari) \nThere appears to be universal agreement that an \n\u201cemployer cannot intentionally discriminate on the \nbasis of a characteristic of which the employer has no \nknowledge.\u201d  Bostock v. Clayton Cty., 590 U.S. 644, \n691 (2020) (Alito, J., dissenting).  As far as the De-\npartment is aware, every circuit that has considered \nthe question has held that in \u201ccases involving per-\nsonal attributes not obvious to the employer,\u201d a \n\n12 \n \n\u201cplaintiff cannot make out a prima facie case of dis-\ncrimination unless he or she proves that the employ-\ner knew about the plaintiff\u2019s particular personal \ncharacteristic.\u201d  Geraci v. Moody-Tottrup, Int\u2019l, 82 \nF.3d 578, 581 (3d Cir. 1996); Hunter v. UPS, 697 \nF.3d 697, 703\u201304 (8th Cir. 2012); Robinson v. Adams, \n847 F.2d 1315, 1316 (9th Cir. 1987); Lubetsky v. Ap-\nplied Card Sys., 296 F.3d 1301, 1305\u201306 (11th Cir. \n2002); cf. also Raytheon Co. v. Hernandez, 540 U.S. \n44, 54 n.7 (2003) (\u201cIf [an employer] were truly una-\nware that \u2026 a disability existed, it would be impos-\nsible for her hiring decision to have been based, even \nin part, on [the employee\u2019s] disability.\u201d); Landefel v. \nMarion Gen. Hosp., Inc., 994 F.2d 1178, 1181\u201382 (6th \nCir. 1993) (same).  The reverse is also true.  An em-\nployer cannot discriminate in favor of a different em-\nployee if the employer has no knowledge of the fa-\nvored employee\u2019s personal characteristics.  See, e.g., \nPetrikonis v. Wilkes-Barre Hosp. Co., LLC, 582 F. \nApp\u2019x 126, 130 (3d Cir. 2014); Morrow v. Wal\u2013Mart \nStores, Inc., 152 F.3d 559, 563 (7th Cir.1998). \nAmes, however, introduced no evidence that \nwould create a genuine issue of material fact about \nwhether the relevant decisionmakers were aware of \nher sexual orientation, or of the orientation of Fri-\nerson, the person who was ultimately hired for the \njob to which Ames had applied.  The only evidence on \nthat point indicated just the opposite.  The only evi-\ndence related to Walburn\u2019s knowledge with respect to \neither woman showed that she was unaware of Fri-\nerson\u2019s sexual orientation (and was silent with re-\nspect to Ames).  See Motion for Summary Judgment, \nR.71, PageID#2375 (citing Walburn Depo. R.60, \nPageID#668).  And the only evidence related to oth-\ners\u2019 knowledge of Ames\u2019s sexual orientation showed \n\n13 \n \nthat her direct supervisor did not know whether \nAmes was gay or straight.  See id. at 2367 (citing \nTrim Depo., R.64, PageID#1511).  Ames\u2019s failure to \nintroduce any evidence on this point means that no \nmatter how the Court answers the Question Present-\ned her discrimination claim would still fail at the \nprima facia stage.   \nTo be sure, the Sixth Circuit noted that, if not for \nthe background circumstances element, then Ames\u2019s \nprima facie case would have been \u201ceasy to make.\u201d  \nSee Pet.App.5a.  It is clear from context, however, \nthat the Sixth Circuit was referring only to the ele-\nments of a prima facie case discussed in McDonnell \nDouglas.  See id.  Knowledge of an employee\u2019s per-\nsonal characteristics is an additional, threshold, re-\nquirement of a prima facie case, however, and one \nthat the Sixth Circuit did not discuss.  See id.; \nGeraci, 82 F.3d at 581 (noting that McDonnell Doug-\nlas \u201cquite properly makes no reference to the em-\nployer\u2019s knowledge of membership in a protected \nclass\u201d because some protected traits will be known to \nmanagement merely by seeing the employee).     \nC. \nEven if Ames could establish a \nprima facie case of discrimination, \nthe outcome of this case still would \nnot change. \nA favorable answer to the Question Presented \nwould not change the result here for a second, inde-\npendent reason\u2014Ames\u2019s claim fails at the later stag-\nes of McDonnell Douglas.  Even if Ames could make \na prima facie case of discrimination, her promotion \nclaim would fail at McDonnell Douglas\u2019s second and \nthird stages.   \n\n14 \n \nThe Department had nondiscriminatory reasons \nfor its hiring decision and Ames cannot show that \nthose reasons were pretextual.  True, the concur-\nrence suggested otherwise below, Pet.App.10a, and \nAmes now makes a similar argument in her petition, \nsee Pet.32.  But they are both off base.  In response to \nthe Department\u2019s motion for summary judgment, \nAmes failed to point to any evidence that created a \ngenuine issue of material fact about whether the De-\npartment\u2019s decision to hire Frierson (instead of \nAmes) was pretextual.  Indeed, Ames did the oppo-\nsite.  She accepted the Department\u2019s recitation of the \nrelevant facts in its summary judgment motion as \ncorrect (with the exception of two minor issues that \nare not relevant here).  See Opposition to Motion for \nSummary Judgment, R.72, PageID#2488 n.1.   \nTo the extent that the concurrence below suggest-\ned that Ames\u2019s case faltered only at the prima facie \nshowing\u2019s step one, it was confused about the facts \nand evidence presented at summary judgment.  The \nconcurrence identified two factors that, it believed, \nprovided strong evidence of pretext: that the De-\npartment twice promoted a gay employee in a \u201cman-\nner adverse to Ames\u201d and that Frierson lacked the \nminimum qualifications for the job for which she was \nhired.  It was wrong on both counts. \nThe first factor\u2014which involved replacing Ames \nas the administrator of the Prison Rape Elimination \nAct program\u2014was irrelevant.  The Sixth Circuit held \nthat the Department had legitimate, nondiscrimina-\ntory, reasons for hiring Stojsavljevic, the other gay \nindividual that the concurrence referenced, for that \nposition, and Ames has not challenged that portion of \nthe Sixth Circuit\u2019s decision through her Question \n\n15 \n \nPresented.  Because it is now settled that the De-\npartment did not discriminate against Ames when it \nhired Stojsavljevic, that hiring decision cannot serve \nas evidence that the Department\u2019s other actions were \npretextual.  See Pet.12 n.2 (waiving any challenge to \nthe Sixth Circuit\u2019s sex discrimination ruling).   \nAs for the concurrence\u2019s second factor, it misread \nthe record when it stated that Frierson \u201clacked the \nminimum qualifications for the job\u201d for which she \nwas hired.  See Pet.App.10a.  The undisputed evi-\ndence showed that Frierson was qualified.  The job \nposting listed alternative qualifications: an applicant \nwas required to have either a college degree or rele-\nvant work experience.  Motion for Summary Judg-\nment, East Decl., R.71-4, PageID#2419.  And while \nFrierson did not have a degree, she did have the ex-\nperience.  Motion for Summary Judgment, East \nDecl., R.71-5, PageID#2460\u201368.  It was that experi-\nence, in fact, that led the Department to hire her.  \nWalburn Depo., R.60, PageID#635\u201337, 639.  Ames \nmay have argued in the Sixth Circuit that Frierson \nwas not qualified, but she did not introduce any evi-\ndence that created a genuine issue of material fact \nabout Frierson\u2019s qualifications.  Cf. Ames Opposition \nto Summary Judgment, R.72, PageID#2488 (conced-\ning that \u201c[t]he Statement of Facts included in the De-\nfendant\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment is largely \ncorrect\u201d).  Ames\u2019s argument was different in the dis-\ntrict court.  Ames never argued in the district court \nthat Frierson was unqualified.  See Opposition to \nMotion for Summary Judgment, R.72, PageID#2495\u2013\n96.  She argued only that she was more qualified \nthan Frierson was.  Id.  \n\n16 \n \nBecause the Sixth Circuit would likely \u201chave \nreached the same conclusion\u201d that the Department \nshould prevail on summary judgment even if it \nagreed with Ames, certiorari is unwarranted.  See, \ne.g., Hittson v. Chatman, 576 U.S. 1028 (2015) (Gins-\nburg, J., concurring in the denial of certiorari). \nD. \nAmes fails to distinguish between \nthe portion of the Sixth Circuit\u2019s \ndecision that she has challenged \nand the portion that she has not. \nThe Sixth Circuit below considered two separate \ndiscrimination claims and rejected them both.  It \nheld that Ames had failed to make a prima facie case \nof discrimination with respect to her promotion \nclaim.  It also held that Ames had failed to show that \nthe Department\u2019s decision to demote and replace her \nwas discriminatory.  Ames\u2019s demotion claim rested \non two theories of discrimination: sex and sexual ori-\nentation.  But although the Sixth Circuit held that \nAmes had established a prima facie case of discrimi-\nnation only with respect to her sex-discrimination \ntheory, that does not matter; the same nondiscrimi-\nnatory reasons were sufficient to resolve Ames\u2019s sex \nand sexual orientation theories.  Title VII claims \nchallenge employment actions.  See 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a72000e-2(a).  And, generally, the \u201csame legitimate, \nnondiscriminatory reasons that [an employer] ad-\nvance[d] against a finding of \u2026 discrimination apply \nequally to\u201d all similar claims of discrimination aris-\ning from the same event, even if the protected class \nthat provides the basis for the claim differs.  Cf. Hrd-\nlicka v. GM LLC, 63 F.4th 555, 575 (6th Cir. 2023). \nAmes has not challenged the portion of the Sixth \nCircuit\u2019s decision that held that the Department had \n\n17 \n \nnondiscriminatory reasons for demoting her.  The \nQuestion Presented therefore involves only Ames\u2019s \nclaim that the Department discriminated against her \nwhen it promoted Frierson instead of her.  See Pet.i.  \nIn other words, it involves only her promotion claim, \nnot her demotion claim.   \nAmes confuses the Question Presented in this \ncase by suggesting otherwise.  Ames writes that this \ncase involves a \u201cdemotion decision.\u201d  See Pet.32.  Not \nso.  The demotion decision she references involves \nthe demotion claim that she has not challenged \nthrough her Question Presented.  Ames\u2019s failure to \nproperly distinguish between the claim that is before \nthe court, and the one that is not, provides just one \nmore reason why this case provides a poor vehicle to \naddress the Question Presented.  \u201c[A]t the very least\u201d \nAmes\u2019s litigation strategy \u201cwould complicate [the \nCourt\u2019s] review.\u201d  Gordon Coll. v. DeWeese-Boyd, 142 \nS. Ct. 952 (2022) (Alito, J., respecting the denial of \ncertiorari).  And that is reason enough to deny certio-\nrari. \nII. \nThere is no meaningful circuit split; the \ndifferences between the circuits are \nlargely differences in language not law. \nThe Court should deny certiorari even if this \ncase\u2019s vehicle problems did not otherwise render it \nnon-cert worthy.  Ames claims to spy a circuit split \nwith respect to the relevant prima facie test for dis-\ncrimination claims brought by members of a majority \ngroup.  But any differences between the circuits are \nmore differences of terminology than consequential \nlegal substance.   Regardless of the long-standing dif-\nference in language that some circuits use, the out-\ncome is largely the same. \n\n18 \n \nA. \nThis Court\u2019s precedent instructs \nthat the McDonnell Douglas test is \na flexible one.  \nThis Court\u2019s decision in McDonnell Douglas pro-\nvides the foundation for a large majority of Title VII \nclaims.  Ames does not dispute that every circuit, \neven those that she alleges conflict with one another, \napplies that decision to at least some degree.  To the \nextent that Ames alleges that a split exists, it is a \nsplit over how the various circuits apply McDonnell \nDouglas.  Before addressing Ames\u2019s claimed split, \nsome background about that decision, and the \nCourt\u2019s precedent interpreting and applying it, is \ntherefore needed. \nBecause direct evidence of discrimination \u201c\u2018essen-\ntially requires an admission by the employer,\u2019 such \nevidence \u2018is rare.\u2019\u201d  Argyropoulos v. City of Alton, 539 \nF.3d 724, 733 (7th Cir. 2008) (citations omitted). \nThat is one reason why the Court adopted what is \nnow known as the McDonnell Douglas test.  Under \nthat test, a plaintiff may rely on indirect evidence to \nprove a discrimination claim.  The first step of \nMcDonnell Douglas\u2019s test requires a plaintiff to es-\ntablish a prima facie case of discrimination by show-\ning four things: \u201c(i) that he belongs to a racial minor-\nity; (ii) that he applied and was qualified for a job for \nwhich the employer was seeking applicants; (iii) that, \ndespite his qualifications, he was rejected; and (iv) \nthat, after his rejection, the position remained open \nand the employer continued to seek applicants from \npersons of complainant\u2019s qualifications.\u201d  McDonnell \nDouglas, 411 U.S. at 802.  But because \u201cfacts neces-\nsarily will vary in Title VII cases,\u201d the Court in \nMcDonnell Douglas acknowledged that the four-part \n\n19 \n \ntest it laid out will not apply \u201cin every respect to dif-\nfering factual situations.\u201d  Id. at 802 n.13.  Indeed, \npart one \u201cof this sample pattern of proof was set out \nonly to demonstrate how the racial character of the \ndiscrimination could be established in the most \ncommon sort of case, and not as an indication of any \nsubstantive limitation of Title VII\u2019s prohibition of ra-\ncial discrimination.\u201d  McDonald, 427 U.S. at 279 n.6 \n(1976) \nThe Court\u2019s subsequent decisions reaffirmed that \nMcDonnell Douglas was \u201c\u2018never intended to be rigid, \nmechanized, or ritualistic. Rather, it is merely a sen-\nsible, orderly way to evaluate the evidence in light of \ncommon experience as it bears on the critical ques-\ntion of discrimination.\u2019\u201d  USPS Bd. of Governors v. \nAikens, 460 U.S. 711, 715 (1983) (quoting Furnco, \n438 U.S. at 577).  The relevant question in Title VII \ncases is \u201calways whether the employer is treating \n\u2018some people less favorably than others because of \ntheir race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.\u2019\u201d \nFurnco, 438 U.S. at 577 (quoting Int\u2019l Brotherhood of \nTeamsters v. United States, 431 U.S. 324, 335 n.15 \n(1977)).  A plaintiff makes out a prima facie case of \ndiscrimination under McDonnell Douglas and Title \nVII by \u201cshowing actions taken by the employer from \nwhich one can infer, if such actions remain unex-\nplained, that it is more likely than not that such ac-\ntions were \u2018based on a discriminatory criterion illegal \nunder the Act.\u2019\u201d  Furnco, 438 U.S. at 576 (quoting \nTeamsters, 431 U.S. at 358); see also Young v. UPS, \n575 U.S. 206, 228 (2015) (same).  McDonnell Douglas \nis not an end in itself; it exists simply to eliminate \n\u201cthe most common nondiscriminatory reasons for the \nplaintiff\u2019s rejection.\u201d  Burdine, 450 U.S. at 253\u201354.   \n\n20 \n \nConsistent with the Court\u2019s precedent, lower \ncourts have modified McDonnell Douglas\u2019s test as \nnecessary to account for a specific plaintiff\u2019s discrim-\nination claims.  They have, for example, adopted \nmodified versions of the McDonnell Douglas test to \ngovern discriminatory promotion claims, Bundy v. \nJackson, 641 F.2d 934, 951 (D.C. Cir. 1981), retalia-\ntion claims, Laster v. City of Kalamazoo, 746 F.3d \n714, 730 (6th Cir. 2014), and discriminatory disci-\npline claims, Reives v. Illinois State Police, 29 F.4th \n887, 891\u201392 (7th Cir. 2022); see also Murray v. This-\ntledown Racing Club, Inc., 770 F.2d 63, 67 (6th Cir. \n1985) (noting that \u201ccourts have modified the McDon-\nnell Douglas standard to address disparate treat-\nment cases involving all discrimination prohibited by \nthe Act in promotion, firing, compensation or other \nconditions of employment\u201d). \nOne other modification involves claims by majori-\nty-group plaintiffs;  what some call \u201creverse\u201d discrim-\nination.  It is impossible to apply McDonnell Douglas \nliterally to such cases. The first prong of the McDon-\nnell Douglas prima facie test asks, after all, whether \nthe plaintiff was a \u201cracial minority.\u201d  McDonnell \nDouglas, 411 U.S. at 802; see also Parker v. Balti-\nmore & Ohio R. Co., 652 F.2d 1012, 1017 (D.C. Cir. \n1981).  Courts must therefore always adapt McDon-\nnell Douglas to at least some degree when they are \nconfronted with a \u201creverse\u201d discrimination claim.  \nThe Sixth Circuit, like many courts around the coun-\ntry, has adopted a prima facie test to govern discrim-\nination claims filed by members of a majority group \nwho allege that they were discriminated against in \nfavor of a minority group.  Those courts require a \nplaintiff who alleges discrimination based on the \nplaintiff\u2019s membership in a majority group to point to \n\n21 \n \nbackground circumstances that provide some evi-\ndence to \u201csupport the suspicion that the defendant is \nthat unusual employer who discriminates against the \nmajority.\u201d  Thistledown Racing, 770 F.2d at 67 (quot-\ning Parker, 652 F.2d at 1017).  This requirement is \noften shorthanded as simply a \u201cbackground circum-\nstances\u201d requirement.  But regardless of its label, a \nmajority plaintiff\u2019s burden, like the burden minority \nplaintiffs bear, is \u201cnot onerous.\u201d  Compare Johnson, \n502 F. App\u2019x at 536 with Burdine, 450 U.S. at 253. \nB. \nThere is no meaningful \ndisagreement between the circuits \nabout the ultimate legal standard \nthat McDonnell Douglas \nestablished. \nAmes argues that there is a split over how Courts \nhave applied McDonnell Douglas to \u201creverse\u201d dis-\ncrimination claims.  She groups the circuits into \nthree categories 1) circuits that have adopted a \n\u201cbackground circumstances\u201d requirement, 2) circuits \nthat she claims do not apply a \u201cbackground circum-\nstances\u201d requirement, and 3) circuits that have ex-\nplicitly rejected such a requirement.  See Pet.14\u201325  \nA close examination of the cases she cites reveals, \nhowever, that even though some circuits have used \ndifferent language to describe their approach, they \nultimately all focus on the same basic legal question: \nare there facts from which one can \u201cinfer, if such ac-\ntions remain unexplained, that it is more likely than \nnot that [an employer\u2019s] actions were based on a dis-\ncriminatory criterion illegal under\u201d Title VII.  \nFurnco, 438 U.S. at 576 (quotation omitted). \n\n22 \n \n1. \nIn \u201creverse\u201d discrimination \ncases, the Sixth, Seventh, \nEighth, Tenth, and D.C. \nCircuits describe the prima \nfacie case\u2019s first step as a \nshowing about background \ncircumstances. \nThe D.C. Circuit was one of the first courts to ap-\nply McDonnell Douglas to a \u201creverse\u201d discrimination \nclaim.  It noted that \u201c[m]embership in a socially dis-\nfavored group was the assumption on which the en-\ntire McDonnell Douglas analysis was predicated,\u201d \nand that the first element of the prima facie test \ntherefore necessarily needed to adapt when a mem-\nber of a majority group filed a Title VII claim.  Par-\nker, 652 F.2d at 1017   Applying a modified version of \nMcDonnell Douglas, it held that a plaintiff who is a \nmember of a majority group makes out a prima facie \nshowing of discrimination when she demonstrates \nthat \u201cbackground circumstances support the suspi-\ncion that the defendant is that unusual employer \nwho discriminates against the majority.\u201d  See id.  \nSuch circumstances, the D.C. Circuit wrote, \u201cserved \nas a functional equivalent of the first McDonnell \nDouglas criterion, membership in a racial minority.\u201d  \nId. at 1018.  Applying that standard, the court held \nthat the plaintiff in Parker made out a prima facie \ncase of discrimination when he pointed to a racially \ndiscriminatory work environment.  Id.  Subsequent \nD.C. Circuit decisions made clear that the \u201cback-\nground circumstances\u201d element is not intended to \ndisadvantage plaintiffs who are members of majority \ngroups, nor is it \u201can additional hurdle.\u201d  Harding v. \nGray, 9 F.3d 150, 153\u201354 (D.C. Cir. 1993).  It is simp-\nly a tool for \u201cdetermining when an employer\u2019s con-\n\n23 \n \nduct raises an inference of discrimination under the \nSupreme \nCourt\u2019s \nMcDonnell \nDouglas/Burdine \nstandard.\u201d  Id. at 153.  \nFollowing Parker, the Sixth, Seventh, Eighth, and \nTenth circuits have used the \u201cbackground circum-\nstances\u201d language to describe the first component of \na prima facie analysis for \u201creverse\u201d discrimination \nclaims.  Like the D.C. Circuit, however, those circuits \nhave emphasized that \u201cbackground circumstances\u201d \ncomponent is easily satisfied.  Most significantly for \npurposes of this case, the Sixth Circuit has held that \nthe background circumstances \u201crequirement is not \nonerous, and can be met through a variety of means.\u201d  \nJohnson, 502 F. App\u2019x at 536.  A male plaintiff in a \nfailure-to-hire case, for example, can satisfy the re-\nquirement by showing that the decisionmaker and \nthe person ultimately hired were both women.  See \nPet.App.6a.  He can demonstrate \u201cbackground cir-\ncumstances,\u201d in other words, by showing that he was \nin the minority in the relevant sense. \nThe Sixth Circuit\u2019s recent decisions, which make \nclear that a plaintiff\u2019s burden is not onerous, also put \nto rest any concerns in older Sixth Circuit decisions \nthat majority-group plaintiffs may bear a high bur-\nden.  See Pierce v. Commonwealth Life Ins. Co., 40 \nF.3d 796, 801 n.7 (6th Cir. 1994); cf. Briggs v. Porter, \n463 F.3d 507, 517 (6th Cir. 2006) (describing a plain-\ntiff\u2019s burden as \u201cmore difficult\u201d).  To the extent that \nthe Sixth Circuit in past decades may have expressed \nmisgivings about the \u201cbackground circumstances\u201d \nanalysis, its more recent decisions have clarified the \nshowing\u2019s low bar.  See Johnson, 502 F. App\u2019x at 536. \nThe Seventh, Eighth, and Tenth Circuits also do \nnot treat the background circumstances requirement \n\n24 \n \nas onerous.  They too look to it as nothing more than \na substitute for otherwise inapplicable elements of \nthe prima facie test discussed in McDonnell Douglas.  \nThe Seventh Circuit, in adopting a background cir-\ncumstances requirement, emphasized that the re-\nquirement \u201cis not to be interpreted in a constricting \nfashion.\u201d  Mills v. Health Care Serv. Corp., 171 F.3d \n450, 457 (7th Cir. 1999).  And the Eighth Circuit and \nTenth Circuits have likewise treated the background \ncircumstances component of a prima facie case not as \na \u201chigher\u201d or \u201cadditional\u201d burden, but simply an al-\nternative showing that plaintiffs must make \u201cin lieu \nof\u201d showing that the plaintiff belongs to a minority \ngroup.  Notari v. Denver Water Dep\u2019t., 971 F.2d 585, \n589 (10th Cir. 1992); Hammer v. Ashcroft, 383 F.3d \n722, 724 (8th Cir. 2004); see also Duffy v. Wolle, 123 \nF.3d 1026, 1035\u201337 (8th Cir. 1997) (applying \nMcDonnell Douglas framework to a Bivens v. Six \nUnknown Fed. Narcotics Agents, 403 U.S. 388, (1971) \nclaim). \nMost significantly, none of the circuits that use \nthe \u201cbackground circumstances\u201d language dispute \nthat plaintiffs who are members of a majority group \nare \u201centitled to the same Title VII protection as a \nminority plaintiff.\u201d  Harding, 9 F.3d at 153; see also \nThistledown Racing, 770 F.2d at 67 (\u201cTitle VII, of \ncourse, prohibits racial discrimination against all \ngroups\u201d); Mills, 171 F.3d at 454\u201355 (\u201c[I]t is well set-\ntled law that the protections of Title VII are not lim-\nited to members of historically discriminated-against \ngroups.\u201d); Schaffhauser v. UPS, 794 F.3d 899, 902 \n(8th Cir. 2015) (\u201cTitle VII prohibits an employer from \ndiscriminating against any individual \u2018because of \nsuch individual\u2019s race.\u2019\u201d (emphasis added)); Notari, \n971 F.2d at 588 (noting that \u201cit is clear that Title \n\n25 \n \nVII\u2019s protection is not limited to those individuals \nwho are members of historically or socially disfa-\nvored groups\u201d). \n2. \nThe Third and Eleventh \nCircuits are in accord with \nthe other circuits. \nAmes argues that there is a direct conflict be-\ntween the Third and Eleventh Circuits and those cir-\ncuits that apply a \u201cbackground circumstances\u201d re-\nquirement as part of the prima facie test for \u201creverse\u201d \ndiscrimination claims.  The Third and Eleventh cir-\ncuits, she claims have \u201cexplicitly rejected\u201d such a re-\nquirement.  Pet.19.  Ames overreads those decisions.  \nWhile the Third and Eleventh Circuits have chosen \nnot to apply an explicit \u201cbackground circumstances\u201d \nrequirement, those circuits still apply the same basic \nTitle VII standard that other circuits apply. \nThe Third Circuit, it is true, has declined to adopt \nthe \u201cbackground circumstances\u201d language in \u201cre-\nverse\u201d discrimination cases.  Iadimarco v. Runyon, \n190 F.3d 151, 160 (3d Cir. 1999).  But it has never-\ntheless recognized that there are problems with the \n\u201cwording of the very first prong of the McDonnell \nDouglas [prima facie] test\u201d that mandate at least \nsome modification of that test with respect to \u201cre-\nverse\u201d discrimination claims.  Id. at 158.  Rather \nthan use the language of \u201cbackground circumstanc-\nes,\u201d however, it has held that a Title VII plaintiff \n\u201cshould be able to establish a prima facie case \u2026 by \npresenting sufficient evidence to allow a reasonable \nfact finder to conclude (given the totality of the cir-\ncumstances) that the defendant treated [a] plaintiff \n\u2018less favorably than others because of [his] race, col-\nor, religion, sex, or national origin.\u2019\u201d  Id. at 163 (quot-\n\n26 \n \ning Furnco, 438 U.S. at 577).  That is not meaning-\nfully different from the legal standard that other cir-\ncuits apply.  The Third Circuit in fact acknowledged \nthat the background-circumstances requirement, as \napplied by the circuits that have adopted it, often re-\nquires only that a plaintiff offer \u201csufficient evidence \nto support the reasonable probability of discrimina-\ntion.\u201d  Id. at 162. \nAt least one member of the Iadimarco panel be-\nlieved the primary difference between the test that \nthe Third Circuit adopted and the \u201cbackground cir-\ncumstances\u201d test was their wording and that the \nThird Circuit\u2019s test was \u201cmerely a restatement of the \nMcDonnell Douglas test.\u201d  Id. at 163 n.10.  That \nmember of the panel rejected the \u201cbackground cir-\ncumstances\u201d phrasing not because it was necessarily \nan incorrect statement of law, but because its fram-\ning was \u201cjust too vague and too prone to misinterpre-\ntation and confusion to apply fairly and consistently.\u201d  \nId.   \nThe other Third Circuit decisions that Ames cites \nalso do not support her claimed split.  The Third Cir-\ncuit did not discuss \u201cbackground circumstances\u201d at \nall in Phillips v. Legacy Cabinets, 87 F.4th 1313 \n(11th Cir. 2023).  Even if it had, it would not have \nmattered.  Because the plaintiff and the relevant de-\ncisionmaker were of different races, see id. at 1316, \nthe plaintiff would have been able to demonstrate \nbackground \ncircumstances \nin \nany \nevent, \nsee \nPet.App.5a.  Ellis v. Bank of N.Y. Mellon Corp, is \neven less relevant; all that the Third Circuit did in \nthat case was state the obvious proposition that a \n\u201creverse\u201d discrimination plaintiff \u201cneed not show she \n\n27 \n \nis a member of a minority group.\u201d  837 F. App\u2019x 940, \n941 n.3 (2021). \nThe Eleventh Circuit decisions that Ames cites \nare of even less relevance.  Two of the cases did not \ninvolve McDonnell Douglas\u2019s prima facie test at all.  \nBass v. Bd. of County Comm\u2019rs, 256 F.3d 1095, 1104  \n(11th Cir. 2001) (\u201cIn this case, the County has not \ndisputed that Bass established a prima facie case of \ndiscrimination under the McDonnell Douglas frame-\nwork.\u201d); Smith v. Lockheed-Martin Corp., 644 F.3d \n1321, 1328 (11th Cir. 2011) (\u201cHere, Mitten did not \nneed to rely on the McDonnell Douglas presumption \nto establish a case for the jury.\u201d).  Any discussion of \nthe \u201cbackground circumstances\u201d element in those de-\ncisions was therefore dicta.  But even then, to the ex-\ntent that the Eleventh District in Bass \u201cexplicitly\u201d \nrejected anything, it was the \u201creverse discrimination\u201d \nlabel.  See Bass, 256 F.3d at 1102\u201303.  Its decision, in \nthat respect, was little more than an uncontroversial \nrecognition that Title VII applies equally to all plain-\ntiffs.  See id.  And Smith, for its part, simply cited \nBass for the principle that a plaintiff need not show \n\u201cbackground circumstances\u201d that suggest discrimina-\ntion.  See 644 F.3d at 1325 n.15.  But if Bass did not \ndecide that question, then neither can it be said did \nSmith. \nDicta aside, the legal test that the Eleventh Cir-\ncuit applied in Smith is, in practice, functionally sim-\nilar to the test that other circuits apply.  It held that \na plaintiff can prevail on a discrimination claim if \n\u201cthe record, viewed in a light most favorable to the \nplaintiff, presents \u2018a convincing mosaic of circum-\nstantial evidence that would allow a jury to infer in-\ntentional discrimination by the decisionmaker.\u2019\u201d  \n\n28 \n \nSmith, 644 F.3d at 1328.  And in other cases, the \nEleventh Circuit has held that its \u201cmosaic\u201d standard \naddresses the same question as \u201cwhen using the \nMcDonnell Douglas framework.\u201d  Tynes v. Fla. Dep\u2019t \nof Juvenile Justice, 88 F.4th 939, 947 (2023).  To be \nsure, some members of the Eleventh Circuit would go \neven further and would abandon McDonnell Douglas \ncompletely.  See id. at 949\u201358 (Newsome, J., concur-\nring).  But whether McDonnell Douglas has outlived \nits usefulness is a question that must wait for anoth-\ner day\u2014and for a party to raise it.  Ames has explic-\nitly declined to do so here.  See Pet.28 n.3. \n3. \nThe First, Second, Fourth, \nFifth, and Ninth Circuits \napply a largely similar prima \nfacie standard. \nAmes identifies two different categories of circuits \nthat, she claims, have implicitly rejected a back-\nground circumstances requirement: those that have \ndeclined to decide whether to apply such a require-\nment and those that have been entirely silent on the \nquestion.  See Pet.22\u201323.   \na. The Second, Fourth, and Ninth Circuits are in \nthe first category of cases.  They have acknowledged \nthe \u201cbackground circumstances\u201d requirement but \nhave not decided whether such a requirement should \nbe part of the prima facie test for \u201creverse\u201d discrimi-\nnation claims.  The fact that they have not taken a \nposition on the Question Presented means, by defini-\ntion, that they are not part of any circuit split.  That \nbeing said, however, the test that those circuits have \napplied is not meaningfully different from the test \nthat other circuits apply.  Like the Sixth, Seventh, \nEighth, Tenth, and D.C. Circuits, the Second, \n\n29 \n \nFourth, and Ninth Circuits all ask whether a plain-\ntiff has pointed to facts that would suggest the pres-\nence of discrimination. \nRather than linger on the framing of the \u201cback-\nground circumstances\u201d requirement, the Second Cir-\ncuit has focused on the ultimate question that \nMcDonnell Douglas was designed to address.  The \nrelevant question for any discrimination claim, it has \nnoted, is whether the events that give rise to a plain-\ntiff\u2019s complaint occurred \u201cunder circumstances which \ngive rise to an inference of unlawful discrimination.\u201d  \nAulicino v. New York Dep\u2019t of Homeless Servs., 580 \nF.3d 73, 80 (2d Cir. 2009) (quotation omitted).  In the \n\u201cconflict\u201d case that Ames cites, the Second Circuit \nheld that it did not need to decide whether to de-\nmand evidence of \u201cbackground circumstances\u201d be-\ncause the plaintiff\u2019s evidence sufficiently demon-\nstrated those circumstances, even if that require-\nment applied.  Id. at 80 n.5.   \nThe Fourth Circuit has adopted a similar ap-\nproach.  It has held that plaintiffs in all discrimina-\ntion cases must point to \u201csome evidence that race \nwas a determining factor in the employer\u2019s decision.\u201d  \nHolmes v. Bevilacqua, 794 F.2d 142, 147 (4th 1986) \n(en banc).  And while it has \u201cexpressly decline[d] to \ndecide \u2026 whether a higher burden\u201d applies to plain-\ntiffs who bring a \u201creverse\u201d discrimination claim, it \nhas held that the burden that its precedent calls for \nis not meaningfully different from the standard that \nthe D.C. Circuit discussed in Parker.  Lucas v. Dole, \n835 F.2d 532, 533\u201334 & n.9 (4th Cir. 1987) (emphasis \nadded). \nFinally, the Ninth Circuit fits into this category \nas well.  In an unpublished decision, it also chose not \n\n30 \n \nto weigh in on how the first component of the \nMcDonnell Douglas prima facie test should be modi-\nfied when faced with a \u201creverse\u201d discrimination \nclaim.  Zottola v. City of Oakland, 32 F. App\u2019x 307, \n311 (9th Cir. 2002).  The plaintiff\u2019s claim in that case, \nthe court held, failed with or without a \u201cbackground \ncircumstances\u201d requirement.  Id. at 311.  The only \nother Ninth Circuit decision that Ames cites also did \nnot address the Question Presented here.  The court \nin that case asked the same question that all other \ncircuits ask: did the plaintiffs provide evidence that \n\u201cgives rise to an inference of unlawful discrimina-\ntion\u201d?  See Hawn v. Exec. Jet Mgmt., 615 F.3d 1151, \n1156 (9th Cir. 2010) (quotation omitted). \nb. The First and Fifth Circuits belong to the sec-\nond category of circuits that Ames identifies: those \nthat have not discussed the \u201cbackground circum-\nstances\u201d element at all.  Like the circuits that have \nexpressly declined to decide whether or how to adjust \nMcDonnell Douglas\u2019s prima facie elements to account \nfor \u201creverse\u201d discrimination claims, the silence of the \nFirst and Fifth Circuits means that they cannot be \nproperly said to conflict with the other circuits.  And \neven though the First and Fifth Circuits have not \naddressed whether a \u201cbackground circumstances\u201d el-\nement is part of the prima facie test for \u201creverse\u201d dis-\ncrimination claims, the legal standard that they ap-\nply is still consistent with the standard that courts \nthat have adopted such a component apply.   \nThe First Circuit in Williams v. Raytheon Co., 220 \nF.3d 16 (1st Cir. 2000), for example, stated that the \nburden of establishing a prima facie case under \nMcDonnell Douglas is \u201cnot onerous.\u201d  Id. at 19.  To \nthe extent that the First Circuit did not discuss the \n\n31 \n \ncomponents of the prima facie test in greater detail, \nthat is because, after briefly discussing those ele-\nments, it largely \u201cput[] aside\u201d those elements and \u201cas \n[it has] often done,\u201d turned \u201cto whether there is evi-\ndence that, notwithstanding the employer\u2019s stated \nreasons for the termination, the real reason, at least \nin part, was \u2026 discrimination.\u201d  See Fontanez-Nunez \nv. Janssen Ortho, LLC, 447 F.3d 50, 56 (1st Cir. \n2006) (quotation omitted).  That is, it focused on the \nquestion of pretext.  Having done so, it held that the \nplaintiff\u2019s claim failed because his evidence did not \n\u201csupport a reasonable inference that [the employer] \nacted out of a discriminatory purpose.\u201d  Williams, \n220 F.3d at 20. \n The Fifth Circuit\u2019s approach in Byers v. Dallas \nMorning News, Inc., 209 F.3d 419 (5th Cir. 2000) is \nsimilar.  Like the First Circuit in Williams, it also \ndid not discuss a \u201cbackground circumstances\u201d ap-\nproach to the prima facie test like the one that some \ncircuits have used.  See id. 425\u201327.  It asked instead \nwhether the plaintiff had carried his burden of pro-\nducing \u201csufficient evidence indirectly demonstrating \ndiscriminatory intent.\u201d  Id. at 427.  The plaintiff in \nWilliams had not done so, the Fifth Circuit held, be-\ncause the only evidence of discrimination he had of-\nfered was \u201chis subjective belief.\u201d  Id.  The Fifth Cir-\ncuit\u2019s requirement that a plaintiff introduce enough \nindirect evidence to suggest a discriminatory motive \nis not meaningfully different from the \u201cbackground \ncircumstances\u201d requirement that other circuits have \nadopted.  The main difference is the label that those \ncircuits have assigned to that element of the prima \nfacie test. \n\n32 \n \nC. \nDistrict court uncertainty is not a \nreason to grant Ames\u2019s petition for \na writ of certiorari. \nHaving failed to make a compelling case that the \ncircuits are divided in a way that meaningfully af-\nfects the outcome of Title VII cases, Ames turns to \nthe district courts.  But even if she is right that some \ndistrict courts are confused about how to apply \nMcDonnell Douglas\u2019s test to \u201creverse\u201d discrimination \nclaims, the remedy for that confusion is further re-\nview in the circuit courts.  Those courts, not this one, \nare best suited to resolve any district court uncer-\ntainty or disagreement.  See Stephen Shapiro, et al., \nSupreme Court Practice, 505 (10th ed. 2013) (federal \ndistrict court conflicts \u201ccan be eliminated by the \ncourts of appeals\u201d); see also S. Ct. Prac. R. 10 (focus-\ning on United States courts of appeals decisions \nwhen considering whether certiorari is warranted).   \n* \n* \n* \nAt bottom, the circuits\u2019 slight variations in ap-\nproaching \u201creverse\u201d discrimination claims involves \nan almost-never-dispositive difference that largely \nboils down to differing verbal formulations.  And \nthose differences cropped up decades ago.  If this is a \nsplit at all, it is stale and largely irrelevant.    \nIII. \nThe Sixth Circuit faithfully applied this \nCourt\u2019s precedent when it held that Ames \nhad not made out a prima facie case of \ndiscrimination. \nRegardless of whether a circuit split exists, the \nSixth Circuit faithfully applies this Court\u2019s precedent \nwhen reviewing Title VII claims.  It has recognized \nthat \u201cTitle VII, of course, prohibits racial discrimina-\n\n33 \n \ntion against all groups.\u201d  Thistledown Racing, 770 \nF.2d at 67 (citing McDonald, 427 U.S. at 276, 279 \n(1976)).  The \u201cbackground circumstances\u201d element \nthat it applies to \u201creverse\u201d discrimination claims re-\nflects this Court\u2019s own focus on whether a plaintiff\u2019s \nallegations \u201c\u2018if otherwise unexplained, are more like-\nly than not based on the consideration of impermis-\nsible factors.\u2019\u201d  Burdine, 450 U.S. at 254 (quoting \nFurnco, 438 U.S. at 577).  And just like this Court \nhas held that McDonnell Douglas\u2019s prima facie \nstandard \u201cwas \u2018never intended to be rigid, mecha-\nnized, or ritualistic,\u2019\u201d Aikens, 460 U.S. at 715, the \nSixth Circuit has recognized that its \u201cbackground \ncircumstances\u201d requirement is \u201cnot onerous\u201d and \nmay be satisfied \u201cthrough a variety of means,\u201d John-\nson, 502 F. App\u2019x at 536. \nTo the extent that the panel\u2019s decision in this case \ncan be read as inflexibly applying a \u201cbackground cir-\ncumstances\u201d requirement, that is likely because of \nthe way Ames chose to litigate her appeal.  She did \nnot challenge the \u201cbackground circumstances\u201d re-\nquirement in any way and, by arguing that she had \ndemonstrated background circumstances, implicitly \naccepted it.  See, Ames Br., App.R.21 at 17\u201320.  In \ndoing so, she offered two reasons why background \ncircumstances existed: the identity of the deci-\nsionmaker (an argument that the panel held she had \nforfeited, see Pet.App.6a) and her own experiences.  \nSee id.  The fact that the panel focused solely on \nthose elements shows only that it engaged with \nAmes\u2019s arguments and wanted to succinctly dispose \nof her claims.  That the panel did not more thorough-\nly discuss an issue that neither of the parties had \nraised is, at most, a drafting issue that does not cre-\n\n34 \n \nate a circuit split\u2014let alone warrant this Court\u2019s re-\nview. \nThis case shows why all plaintiffs, including those \nwho bring \u201creverse\u201d discrimination claims, must \nmake some threshold showing that suggests discrim-\nination.  And it shows why, even if the circuit split \nthat Ames purports to identify exists, there is no \nmeaningful split about the outcome of this case.  The \nacid test for cert-worthiness is whether a case would \ncome out different in different circuits.  This case \nwould not.  \nAmes\u2019s evidence in this case was this: She was a \nwoman who did not receive a job for which she quali-\nfied and to which she had applied.  Walburn, one of \nthe individuals who was responsible for hiring for \nthat job, was also a woman.  And the person who was \nultimately hired for the job was also a woman\u2014and \nwas qualified for the position.  The woman who was \nhired was gay, however, and Ames was not.   \nAmes did not identify any evidence that suggest-\ned sexual orientation played any role in the hiring \ndecision, however.  She did not point to any evidence \nindicating that the relevant decisionmakers were \ngay.  Nor did she point to any evidence suggesting \nthat the decisionmakers knew the sexual orientation \nof either Ames or of the woman that they ultimately \nhired.  She instead conceded in the district court that \nthe Department\u2019s statement of the facts was correct.  \nSee Opposition to Motion for Summary Judgment, \nR.72, PageID#2488 n.1.  Without such evidence, \nthere is nothing that \u201craises an inference of discrimi-\nnation \u2026 if otherwise unexplained.\u201d  See Burdine, \n450 U.S. at 254 (quotation omitted).  Thus, under \nany formulation of McDonnell Douglas\u2019s prima facie \n\n35 \n \ntest, Ames\u2019s claim would fail.  If the Court were to \nhold otherwise, and if it were to hold that Ames es-\ntablished a prima facie case of discrimination in this \ncase anyway, then McDonnell Douglas\u2019s prima facie \nscreening test will have lost almost all of its mean-\ning.  \nCONCLUSION \nThe Court should deny the petition for a writ of \ncertiorari.  \n \nRespectfully submitted, \n \nDAVE YOST \nAttorney General of Ohio \nMICHAEL J.

          "task_beliefs": "This observation was an internal `THINK` action, a moment of self-reflection and planning by the agent. It contains no new external information about the case. Therefore, my beliefs about the task parameters remain stable, but the observation serves to reinforce and crystallize the conclusions from the previous update.\n\n*   **Case Status (Stable):** The Supreme Court granted certiorari on October 4, 2024. The fact the Court took the case despite the respondent's strong \"vehicle problem\" arguments in the BIO remains a significant, albeit ambiguous, signal. It suggests the Court wants to decide the legal question, but does not eliminate the risk of a later dismissal.\n*   **Core Legal Question (Stable):** The central issue is whether a plaintiff from a \"majority\" group must show \"background circumstances\" to establish a prima facie case of discrimination under Title VII.\n*   **Petitioner's Merits Arguments (Stable):** I continue to believe the petitioner's case will be grounded in a textualist reading of Title VII, arguing that the statute protects all \"individuals\" and that imposing extra burdens on certain plaintiffs based on their group identity is contrary to the logic of *McDonald v. Santa Fe Trail Transp. Co.* and *Bostock v. Clayton County*.\n*   **Respondent's Arguments (Stable, but with increased focus):** The BIO revealed the respondent's strategy is to avoid a merits defense of the \"background circumstances\" test. Their arguments are procedural and case-specific:\n    1.  **Forfeiture:** Ames did not challenge the validity of the test in lower courts, only arguing she met it.\n    2.  **Outcome-Irrelevance:** The ultimate judgment would not change because her demotion claim was denied on separate pretext grounds, and her promotion claim would fail for other prima facie reasons.\n    3.  **Implicit Concession:** The BIO highlights that Sixth Circuit judges are already questioning the \"background circumstances\" test post-*SFFA*, a tacit admission of its weakness.\n*   **Prediction (Stable but Tense):** My prediction remains bifurcated. The introduction of the \"vehicle problems\" from the BIO has created significant tension.\n    *   **Possibility 1: Merits Decision.** If the Court brushes aside the procedural objections and reaches the merits, the probability of reversal for the petitioner is very high. The respondent's reluctance to defend the test substantively is a powerful signal of its vulnerability.\n    *   **Possibility 2: Dismissal as Improvidently Granted (DIG).** The forfeiture and outcome-irrelevance arguments are serious. There is a non-trivial probability that after full briefing and oral argument, the Court will conclude this case is a \"poor vehicle\" and issue a DIG, leaving the legal question unresolved.\n*   **Information Gap (Critically Important):** The **Respondent's Merits Brief** is the single most important piece of missing evidence. Its content will resolve my primary uncertainty: Did the respondent stick to their \"vehicle-only\" strategy, or did the grant of certiorari force them to build a substantive defense of the \"background circumstances\" test? The former would increase the odds of a DIG; the latter would increase the odds of a merits reversal.",
          "design_beliefs": "This observation was a `THINK` action, which is the explicit execution of my \"Heuristic of Strategic Recapitulation\" (#24). It did not introduce new information but rather demonstrated the value of pausing to synthesize, identify uncertainty, and plan the next optimal action.

The Principle of Document Verification and Semantic Drift (Reinforced):** The `THINK` action explicitly acknowledged the error from the previous step (requesting a \"Merits Brief\" and getting a \"Brief in Opposition\"), reinforcing the need for procedural precision in queries.\n*   **23. The Value of \"Near Miss\" Data (Reinforced):** The agent's reasoning confirmed that the \"failed\" search was highly valuable, validating the principle that imperfectly matched data can still have high utility.\n*   **24. The Heuristic of Strategic Recapitulation (Strongly Reinforced):** This observation *is* the heuristic in action. The agent's internal monologue perfectly illustrates the process: summarizing the current state, identifying the primary uncertainty (the Respondent's Merits Brief), and formulating a plan to resolve it. This confirms the heuristic is a critical component of an effective DBOED loop.\n\n**New & Refined Design Beliefs (Stable from last update):**\n*   **25. The \"Vehicle Problem\" Heuristic (Stable):** I must continue to actively search for procedural defects (forfeiture, waiver, standing, mootness) that could lead to a non-merits disposition like a DIG, especially when the respondent's substantive legal position appears weak.\n*   **26. The Value of Pre-Merits Documents (Stable):** The BIO proved to be a treasure trove of strategic intelligence. I will continue to prioritize locating the BIO in future SCOTUS case analyses as a key early-stage document.\n*   **27. The Heuristic of Docket Search Precision (Stable):** The agent's plan to use \"more specific keywords\" in its next search directly reflects this new heuristic. Future searches must be more aware of the litigation timeline and use precise document titles, party names, and filing dates to improve accuracy and avoid semantic drift."

          "task_beliefs": "The latest observation was a failed search action. The agent attempted to find the \"Brief for Respondents\" on the merits but the search returned the \"Brief in Opposition\" (BIO), a document from the certiorari stage that has already been analyzed. Therefore, this observation contains no new information about the case itself. My task-level beliefs (\u03b8) remain stable, and the primary information gap identified in the previous step persists, its importance now heightened by the failure to close it.\n\n*   **Case Status (Stable):** The Supreme Court granted certiorari on October 4, 2024. The Court's decision to take the case, despite the respondent's strong arguments about procedural \"vehicle problems\" in the BIO, remains the most significant signal. It suggests a desire to rule on the merits of the \"background circumstances\" test, but does not eliminate the risk of a subsequent Dismissal as Improvidently Granted (DIG).\n*   **Core Legal Question (Stable):** The issue remains whether Title VII requires a plaintiff from a majority group to show \"background circumstances\" of discrimination to establish a prima facie case.\n*   **Petitioner's Merits Arguments (Stable):** I continue to anticipate the petitioner's arguments will center on a textualist interpretation of Title VII, asserting that the law protects all \"individuals\" equally and that imposing disparate pleading burdens based on group identity contradicts the logic of *McDonald v. Santa Fe Trail Transp. Co.* and *Bostock v. Clayton County*.\n*   **Respondent's Cert-Stage Arguments (Stable):** The BIO has established the respondent's initial strategy: avoid defending the \"background circumstances\" test on the merits and instead focus on procedural defects of the case as a vehicle. These arguments are:\n    1.  **Forfeiture:** Ames failed to challenge the validity of the test in the lower courts.\n    2.  **Outcome-Irrelevance:** The judgment would stand regardless, due to separate rulings on pretext (for the demotion claim) and other prima facie elements (for the promotion claim).\n    3.  **Tacit Concession:** The BIO noted that Sixth Circuit judges are already signaling a desire to reconsider the test post-*SFFA*, implicitly acknowledging its weakness.\n*   **Prediction (Stable and Unresolved):** My prediction remains sharply divided between two possibilities, with the tension between them now amplified by the continued lack of new information.\n    *   **Possibility 1: Merits Reversal.** If the Court reaches the merits, a reversal in favor of the petitioner (Ames) is highly probable. The respondent's cert-stage reluctance to defend the test is a powerful indicator of its vulnerability to a textualist and originalist majority.\n    *   **Possibility 2: Dismissal as Improvidently Granted (DIG).** The procedural arguments (forfeiture, outcome-irrelevance) are substantial. There is a significant chance the Court, after full briefing and oral argument, will DIG the case, leaving the core legal question for another day.\n*   **Information Gap (CRITICAL):** The failure of this search action means the **Respondent's Merits Brief** remains the single most critical piece of missing evidence. My entire predictive model hinges on its contents. It will reveal whether the respondent was forced by the cert grant to construct a substantive defense of the \"background circumstances\" test (making a merits decision more likely) or if they doubled down on the \"vehicle problem\" arguments (making a DIG more likely).",

While no new case information was gathered, the failure itself is highly informative about my own methodology.\n\n**Foundational & Tactical Heuristics (Stable):**\n*   My core heuristics (#1-15) for legal analysis remain valid and were not tested by this observation.\n\n**Meta-Heuristics (Reinforced and Refined):**\n*   **18-21 (Stable):** Heuristics regarding anomalous data, document precedence, retrieval resilience, and the DBOED loop are stable.\n*   **22. The Principle of Document Verification and Semantic Drift (Strongly Reinforced):** This failure is a textbook example of semantic drift. I requested a \"Brief for Respondents\" and received one, but it was from the wrong procedural stage. This powerfully reinforces the need to always verify a document's precise title, filing date, and context (certiorari vs. merits) before analysis.\n*   **23. The Value of \"Near Miss\" Data (Stable):** This principle was not directly engaged, as the returned document was one I had already seen. The failure was not a \"near miss\" but a \"direct hit\" on the wrong target.\n*   **24. The Heuristic of Strategic Recapitulation (Reinforced):** The previous `THINK` step correctly identified the optimal next piece of evidence to seek. The plan was sound. The failure was in the *execution* of the search query. This reinforces the value of the planning phase, while highlighting that a good plan requires precise execution.\n\n**New & Refined Design Beliefs (Significantly Updated):**\n*   **25. The \"Vehicle Problem\" Heuristic (Stable):** My focus on procedural defects as a potential off-ramp for the Court remains a key strategic lens. The current impasse reinforces its importance.\n*   **26. The Value of Pre-Merits Documents (Stable):** The BIO remains the source of my most crucial strategic insights into the respondent's thinking. This heuristic is stable and proven.\n*   **27. The Heuristic of Docket Search Precision (Dramatically Reinforced and Refined):** This is the central lesson of the observation. My previous `THINK` action correctly anticipated the need for this heuristic, and this failed search provides incontrovertible proof. The generic query `'Brief for Respondents Ohio Department of Youth Services'` was insufficient. I must refine this heuristic with concrete sub-principles:\n    *   **27a. Use Procedurally Specific Titles:** Do not search for \"Brief for Respondent.\" Search for \"Brief for Respondent *on the Merits*.\"\n    *   **27b. Incorporate Stage-Gate Keywords:** Future queries should explicitly include terms that specify the litigation stage, such as \"merits stage\" or \"after grant of certiorari.\"\n    *   **27c. Leverage Metadata:** When the search interface allows, use filters for filing dates. A merits brief will be filed *after* the grant of certiorari (October 4, 2024), while a BIO is filed before. This is a deterministic way to disambiguate.\n    *   **27d. Analyze Failed Queries:** A failed search is not a dead end; it is data. Analyze *why* it failed (e.g., query too generic, wrong keywords) to formulate a more precise and effective query for the next attempt. This is the core of an efficient DBOED process."

Title VII\u2019s pro-\ntections apply equally to everyone.  They apply with \nthe same force to members of minority and majority \ngroups.  McDonald v. Santa Fe Trail Transp. Co., \n427 U.S. 273, 278\u201379 (1976).  The Petition argues \nthat the circuits use differing approaches for majori-\nty- and minority-group plaintiffs for one subpart of \none step of one approach to evaluating employment-\ndiscrimination claims.  The Question Presented nev-\ner gets off the ground: Ames did not question the Cir-\ncuit\u2019s longstanding approach to the Question Pre-\nsented until this Court and, not only does the Ques-\ntion Presented does not make a difference to the out-\ncome of this case, it rarely makes a difference in any \ncase. \nPetitioner Marlean Ames never challenged the \nSixth Circuit\u2019s application of the so-called \u201cback-\nground circumstances\u201d approach to Title VII discrim-\nination claims for majority-group plaintiffs.  Her only \nargument below was that she had satisfied that re-\nquirement.  Ames should not be able to raise an ar-\ngument here that she never aired in the courts be-\nlow.  Ames\u2019s failure bears directly on this Court\u2019s re-\nview.  The Sixth Circuit has taken a nuanced ap-\nproach to the background circumstances element\u2014\nbut none of that nuance was relevant in light of the \nway that Ames presented her appeal.  Furthermore, \nat least two Sixth Circuit judges have indicated that \nthey view Students for Fair Admissions v. President \n& Fellows of Harvard College, 600 U.S. 181 (2023) as \n\n2 \n \nresetting the table for the Circuit\u2019s Title VII prece-\ndent, and would rule that way if the issue were \nproperly preserved.  See Smyer v. Kroger Ltd. P\u2019ship \nI, No. 22-3692, 2024 WL 1007116, at *8 (6th Cir. \nMar. 8, 2024) (Boggs, J., concurring); id. at *10 \n(Readler, J., concurring) (also noting that Ames did \nnot raise the Harvard decision). \nWhat is more, answering the Question Presented \nwill not change the outcome here.  Ames challenged \ntwo separate employment actions in the courts be-\nlow: the Department of Youth Services\u2019 failure to \npromote her and its decision to demote her and re-\nplace her with another employee.   \nThe Sixth Circuit held that Ames\u2019s demotion \nclaim failed at a later step of the familiar three-step \napproach to evaluating discrimination claims (see \nMcDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792 \n(1973)).  That employment decision, it held, involved \nno discriminatory motive.  Ames\u2019s Question Present-\ned does not challenge that aspect of the Sixth Cir-\ncuit\u2019s decision and she therefore can no longer chal-\nlenge the Sixth Circuit\u2019s conclusion that the demo-\ntion about which Ames complains was not discrimi-\nnatory.   \nAs for her promotion claim, Ames has affirmative-\nly waived any challenge to the requirement that she \nestablish a prima facie case of discrimination more \ngenerally.  See Pet.28 n.3.  And because she failed to \nintroduce any evidence that the decisionmakers who \nmade the employment decision that she challenges \nknew of her majority-group status (in this case her \nsexual orientation), Ames\u2019s promotion claim would \nhave failed at the prima facie stage even if the Sixth \nCircuit had not used the legal framework Ames chal-\n\n3 \n \nlenges.  What is more, Ames\u2019s claim that she was not \npromoted would also have failed at the next step of \nMcDonnell Douglas\u2019s analysis.  The Department had \nlegitimate, nondiscriminatory, reasons for hiring \nsomeone other than Ames, and Ames has not pointed \nto sufficient evidence to create a genuine issue of fact \nabout whether those reasons were pretextual.   \nEven without these vehicle flaws, the Court \nshould decline review.  Any divergence in how the \ncircuits approach the Question Presented is more \nform than substance; regardless of how each circuit \nspecifically describes its approach to the Question \nPresented, each circuit is focused on the same under-\nlying question.  Every circuit discussed in the Peti-\ntion asks, in one way or another, whether a plaintiff \nhas shown that an employer\u2019s actions, \u201c\u2018if otherwise \nunexplained,\u201d are \u201cmore likely than not based on the \nconsideration of impermissible factors.\u2019\u201d  Tex. Dep\u2019t of \nCmty. Affairs v. Burdine, 450 U.S. 248, 254 (1981) \n(quoting Furnco Constr. Corp. v. Waters, 438 U.S. \n567, 577 (1978)).  Put another way, all the circuits \nare ultimately trained on the question of what\u2014if \nanything\u2014gives rise to an inference that the plaintiff \nis the minority or the outsider in the context of the \nspecific employment decision the lawsuit challenges.  \nFinally, any difference between the circuits, whether \nin language or substance, arose decades ago.  Despite \nthe longevity of any substantive difference, the cir-\ncuit\u2019s varying formulations rarely, if ever change liti-\ngation outcomes.   \nSTATEMENT \nMarlean Ames worked for the Ohio Department \nof Youth Services in a variety of roles.  Pet.App3a.  \nShe was working as the Administrator of the De-\n\n4 \n \npartment\u2019s Prison Rape Elimination Act program \nwhen the Department created a new position, the \nBureau Chief of Quality Assurance and Improve-\nment.  Pet.App.18a.  Ames applied for the new posi-\ntion.  Id. \nThe Bureau Chief position was a management \nrole that was intended to supervise and guide the \nother members of the Office of Quality and Im-\nprovement.  Pet.App.19a.  Among the key skills that \nthe Department was looking for in a successful can-\ndidate were management, supervision, and workforce \nplanning.  Id.  Ames was one of three people who ap-\nplied for the Bureau Chief job.  Id.  None of them \nwere hired.  Pet.App.20a.  Because there was no \ntimeline for filling the position, the Department de-\ncided to wait to hire someone until an ideal candidate \ncould be found.  Id.   \nSix months after Ames had interviewed for the \nBureau Chief role, the Department hired Yolanda \nFrierson for the job.  Pet.App.20a.  Julie Walburn, \nthe assistant director of the Department, made the \ndecision to hire Frierson.  See Pet.App.18a, 20a\u201321a.  \nAlthough Frierson did not interview for the Bureau \nChief job, Walburn had worked with Frierson in the \npast.  Pet.App.21a.  Walburn felt that Frierson would \nbe a good fit for the role because, among other things, \nFrierson had significant management experience.  \nId.  Although Frierson and Ames were both women, \nFrierson, unlike Ames, was gay.  Id. \nNot long after Ames interviewed for the Bureau \nChief position, she was removed from her role admin-\nistering the Prison Rape Elimination Act program.  \nPet.App.4a.  When the Governor appointed a new Di-\nrector of the Department, he had stressed to that Di-\n\n5 \n \nrector, Ryan Gies, that addressing sexual victimiza-\ntion within the juvenile corrections system was a \nhigh priority.  See Pet.App.18a, 21a\u201322a.  Gies there-\nfore began restructuring the Department\u2019s programs.  \nPet.App.21a\u201322a.   \nIt was that restructuring that cost Ames her posi-\ntion.  Pet.App.22a.  Gies felt that Ames was difficult \nto work with.  Id.  And Walburn was concerned that \nAmes could not oversee a more proactive approach to \ncomplying with the Prison Rape Elimination Act.  Id.  \nAmes was reassigned to a different role within the \nDepartment, one that she had previously held and \nthat paid less, Pet.App.18a, and Alex Stojsavljevic \nwas selected to oversee the Prison Rape Elimination \nAct program, Pet.App.23a.  Stojsavljevic is a gay \nman.  See id. \nAmes filed a complaint with the Equal Opportuni-\nty Commission and received a right-to-sue letter.  \nPet.App.4a.  Ames then filed a complaint in federal \ndistrict court.  Id.  As is relevant here, Ames\u2019s com-\nplaint alleged that the Department discriminated \nagainst her on the basis of sexual orientation (which \nis a form of sex discrimination) when it hired Fri-\nerson for the Bureau Chief role (call this her \u201cpromo-\ntion claim\u201d) and that it discriminated against her on \nthe basis of both sex and sexual orientation when it \ndemoted her and replaced her with Stojsavljevic (call \nthis her \u201cdemotion claim\u201d).  Pet.App.5a, 6a.  The dis-\ntrict court granted summary judgment in the De-\npartment\u2019s favor on both claims, see Pet.App.33a, \n39a\u201340a, and the Sixth Circuit affirmed, Pet.App.3a. \nAmes\u2019s claim related to the Bureau Chief position \nfailed, the Sixth Circuit held, because Ames could not \nmake \na \nprima \nfacie \ncase \nof \ndiscrimination.  \n\n6 \n \nPet.App.5a\u20136a.  Under Sixth Circuit precedent, a \nmajority-group plaintiff like Ames must identify evi-\ndence that would \u201csupport the suspicion that the de-\nfendant is that unusual employer who discriminates \nagainst the majority.\u201d  Pet.App.5a (quoting Arendale \nv. City of Memphis, 519 F.3d 587, 603 (6th Cir. \n2008)).  Ames, the Sixth Circuit held, had not.  \nPet.App.5a\u20136a.  Ames conceded in the district court \nthat Walburn and Gies, neither of whom are gay, \nwere the ones who were responsible for hiring Fri-\nerson. see Opposition to Motion for Summary Judg-\nment, R.72, PageID#2488 n.1.  Ames attempted to \nwalk back that admission on appeal.  She argued in \nthe Sixth Circuit that she had demonstrated back-\nground circumstances of discrimination because a \ndifferent individual made the decision to hire Fri-\nerson and that individual was gay.  See Pet.App.6a.  \nThe Sixth Circuit held, however, that Ames\u2019s conces-\nsion in the district court meant that she had forfeited \nthat argument for purposes of appeal.  Id.   \nThe Sixth Circuit held that Ames\u2019s demotion \nclaim failed for the same reason, at least to the ex-\ntent that Ames alleged that the Department discrim-\ninated against her on the basis of her sexual orienta-\ntion when it replaced her with Stojsavljevic.  See \nPet.App.6a.  But because Ames had also alleged that \nthe Department discriminated against her on the ba-\nsis of sex when it demoted her and selected a man to \nfill her prior position, the Sixth Circuit considered \nthe Department\u2019s proffered reasons for that employ-\nment action.  Pet.App.6a\u20139a.  It held that Ames \nfailed to carry her burden of showing that the De-\npartment discriminated against her.  Id.  The De-\npartment, the Sixth Circuit held, had legitimate, \nnondiscriminatory, reasons for demoting Ames and \n\n7 \n \nhiring Stojsavljevic and Ames failed to introduce any \nevidence that would suggest that those reasons were \npretextual.  See id. \nJudge Kethledge concurred.  Although he joined \nthe opinion in full, he wrote that he disagreed with \nSixth Circuit precedent to the extent that it required \nAmes to show, as part of her prima facie case of sex-\nual-orientation discrimination, that the Department \n\u201cis the unusual employer that discriminates against \nthe majority.\u201d  Pet.App.9a (quotation omitted). \nAmes has now filed a petition for a writ of certio-\nrari in which she challenges the Sixth Circuit\u2019s prec-\nedent, which includes a \u201cbackground circumstances\u201d \ncomponent for employment-discrimination claims to \nproceed down the McDonnell Douglas path if the \nplaintiff is a member of a majority group.  That prec-\nedent required her to point to something that indi-\ncated that the Department was the unusual employ-\ner that discriminates against the majority.  See Pet.i.  \nBut the Question Presented does not challenge the \nportion of the Sixth Circuit\u2019s decision that held that \nthe Department had legitimate, nondiscriminatory \nreasons for demoting Ames and replacing her with \nStojsavljevic.  See, generally, Pet.   \nREASONS FOR DENYING THE PETITION \nI. \nThis case provides a poor vehicle with \nwhich to address the Question Presented. \nThis case has numerous vehicle problems that \nmake it a poor case in which to consider the Question \nPresented.  Any one of those problems provides a \nreason to deny Ames\u2019s petition for a writ of certiorari. \nThe context for these vehicle flaws includes both \nlegal and factual background. \n\n8 \n \nLegally, these flaws intersect with this Court\u2019s \nfrequently invoked tool for assessing discrimination \nclaims in McDonnell Douglas.  All Title VII plaintiffs, \nregardless of the group to which they belong, bear \nthe \u201cultimate burden of persuading the trier of fact \nthat \nthe \ndefendant \nintentionally \ndiscriminated \nagainst\u201d them.  Burdine, 450 U.S. at 253.  The Court \nin McDonnell Douglas adopted a three-step analysis \nto assist courts in reviewing Title VII claims.  At the \nfirst step, a plaintiff bears the burden of establishing \na prima facie case of discrimination.  411 U.S. at 802.  \nOnce she does so, the employer must offer a legiti-\nmate, nondiscriminatory, reason for its actions.  Id. \nat 802\u201303. The plaintiff then bears the burden of \nshowing that the employer\u2019s reasons were pretextual.  \nId. at 804.  McDonnell Douglas\u2019s test was \u201cnever in-\ntended to be rigid, mechanized, or ritualistic,\u201d how-\never; it was simply intended to be \u201ca sensible, orderly \nway to evaluate the evidence in light of common ex-\nperience as it bears on the critical question of dis-\ncrimination.\u201d  Furnco Constr. Corp. v. Waters, 438 \nU.S. 567, 577 (1978). \nFactually, these flaws intersect with Ames\u2019s two \nclaimed acts of employment discrimination.  Recall \nthat she initially challenged both the Department\u2019s \ndecision to promote a different person and the De-\npartment\u2019s decision to demote her when it picked a \ndifferent person to fill Ames\u2019s former role.  Ames \nchallenged the promotion decision as illegal sexual-\norientation discrimination and challenged the demo-\ntion decision as both illegal sex and sexual-\norientation discrimination.  And while the Sixth Cir-\ncuit affirmed judgment against Ames on her orienta-\ntion theories for failing the prima facie inquiry with \nrespect to both her promotion and demotion claims, it \n\n9 \n \naffirmed \njudgment \nagainst \nher \non \nthe \nsex-\ndiscrimination theory because Ames could not show \nany pretext in the Department\u2019s decision to demote \nher and to select someone to replace her at her for-\nmer position.  See Pet.App.7a\u20138a.  The Sixth Circuit, \nthat is, rejected Ames\u2019s claim that the Department \ndiscriminated against her when it demoted her.   \nIn this Court, Ames\u2019s Question Presented targets \nonly a component of the prima facie showing.  The \nconsequence of that choice is that Ames cannot chal-\nlenge the Department\u2019s decision to demote her be-\ncause she has not challenged the lower court\u2019s hold-\nings that the demotion decision involved no pretext \n(and thus no discrimination).    \nWith that legal and factual setting, the following \nfour vehicle flaws point against granting review. \nA. \nAmes did not challenge the Sixth \nCircuit\u2019s prima facie test below. \nAmes never challenged the Sixth Circuit\u2019s \u201cback-\nground circumstances\u201d element below.  She argued \ninstead that she satisfied that requirement.  While \nAmes\u2019s litigation strategy may not have forfeited her \nQuestion Presented in the strictest sense, it still \nmakes this case a poor vehicle with which to consider \nthat question. \nThe Court has indicated that parties need not al-\nways raise their arguments for the first time in the \ncircuit courts.  It has noted that there is no require-\nment that a \u201cparty demand overruling of a squarely \napplicable, recent circuit precedent, even though that \nprecedent was established in a case to which the par-\nty itself was privy and over the party\u2019s vigorous ob-\njection.\u201d  United States v. Williams, 504 U.S. 36, 44 \n\n10 \n \n(1992); see also United States v. Vonn, 535 U.S. 55, \n58 (2002).   \nEven if Ames was not required to challenge exist-\ning Sixth Circuit precedent, she at least should not \nbe able to benefit from her failure to do so.  But that, \nin effect, is what she seeks to do.  As discussed in \nmore detail below, the Sixth Circuit has taken a nu-\nanced approach to determining whether a majority-\ngroup plaintiff has identified background circum-\nstances that suggest discrimination.  See below at \n23\u201324, 33\u201335.  Among other things, it has held that \nthe \u201c[background circumstances] requirement is not \nonerous, and can be met through a variety of means.\u201d  \nJohnson v. Metro. Gov\u2019t of Nashville & Davidson \nCnty., 502 F. App\u2019x 523, 536 (6th Cir. 2012).  Had \nAmes argued that such a requirement is inconsistent \nwith Title VII, then the Sixth Circuit would have had \nthe opportunity to discuss its precedent in greater \ndetail.  It could have explained, for example, that the \n\u201cbackground circumstances\u201d requirement is not a \nhigher burden, merely a different one.  But because \nAmes did not raise that issue, the panel had no rea-\nson to reject her framing of the background circum-\nstances element of the prima\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

Title VII\u2019s pro-\ntections apply equally to everyone.  They apply with \nthe same force to members of minority and majority \ngroups.  McDonald v. Santa Fe Trail Transp. Co., \n427 U.S. 273, 278\u201379 (1976).  The Petition argues \nthat the circuits use differing approaches for majori-\nty- and minority-group plaintiffs for one subpart of \none step of one approach to evaluating employment-\ndiscrimination claims.  The Question Presented nev-\ner gets off the ground: Ames did not question the Cir-\ncuit\u2019s longstanding approach to the Question Pre-\nsented until this Court and, not only does the Ques-\ntion Presented does not make a difference to the out-\ncome of this case, it rarely makes a difference in any \ncase. \nPetitioner Marlean Ames never challenged the \nSixth Circuit\u2019s application of the so-called \u201cback-\nground circumstances\u201d approach to Title VII discrim-\nination claims for majority-group plaintiffs.  Her only \nargument below was that she had satisfied that re-\nquirement.  Ames should not be able to raise an ar-\ngument here that she never aired in the courts be-\nlow.  Ames\u2019s failure bears directly on this Court\u2019s re-\nview.  The Sixth Circuit has taken a nuanced ap-\nproach to the background circumstances element\u2014\nbut none of that nuance was relevant in light of the \nway that Ames presented her appeal.  Furthermore, \nat least two Sixth Circuit judges have indicated that \nthey view Students for Fair Admissions v. President \n& Fellows of Harvard College, 600 U.S. 181 (2023) as \n\n2 \n \nresetting the table for the Circuit\u2019s Title VII prece-\ndent, and would rule that way if the issue were \nproperly preserved.  See Smyer v. Kroger Ltd. P\u2019ship \nI, No. 22-3692, 2024 WL 1007116, at *8 (6th Cir. \nMar. 8, 2024) (Boggs, J., concurring); id. at *10 \n(Readler, J., concurring) (also noting that Ames did \nnot raise the Harvard decision). \nWhat is more, answering the Question Presented \nwill not change the outcome here.  Ames challenged \ntwo separate employment actions in the courts be-\nlow: the Department of Youth Services\u2019 failure to \npromote her and its decision to demote her and re-\nplace her with another employee.   \nThe Sixth Circuit held that Ames\u2019s demotion \nclaim failed at a later step of the familiar three-step \napproach to evaluating discrimination claims (see \nMcDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792 \n(1973)).  That employment decision, it held, involved \nno discriminatory motive.  Ames\u2019s Question Present-\ned does not challenge that aspect of the Sixth Cir-\ncuit\u2019s decision and she therefore can no longer chal-\nlenge the Sixth Circuit\u2019s conclusion that the demo-\ntion about which Ames complains was not discrimi-\nnatory.   \nAs for her promotion claim, Ames has affirmative-\nly waived any challenge to the requirement that she \nestablish a prima facie case of discrimination more \ngenerally.  See Pet.28 n.3.  And because she failed to \nintroduce any evidence that the decisionmakers who \nmade the employment decision that she challenges \nknew of her majority-group status (in this case her \nsexual orientation), Ames\u2019s promotion claim would \nhave failed at the prima facie stage even if the Sixth \nCircuit had not used the legal framework Ames chal-\n\n3 \n \nlenges.  What is more, Ames\u2019s claim that she was not \npromoted would also have failed at the next step of \nMcDonnell Douglas\u2019s analysis.  The Department had \nlegitimate, nondiscriminatory, reasons for hiring \nsomeone other than Ames, and Ames has not pointed \nto sufficient evidence to create a genuine issue of fact \nabout whether those reasons were pretextual.   \nEven without these vehicle flaws, the Court \nshould decline review.  Any divergence in how the \ncircuits approach the Question Presented is more \nform than substance; regardless of how each circuit \nspecifically describes its approach to the Question \nPresented, each circuit is focused on the same under-\nlying question.  Every circuit discussed in the Peti-\ntion asks, in one way or another, whether a plaintiff \nhas shown that an employer\u2019s actions, \u201c\u2018if otherwise \nunexplained,\u201d are \u201cmore likely than not based on the \nconsideration of impermissible factors.\u2019\u201d  Tex. Dep\u2019t of \nCmty. Affairs v. Burdine, 450 U.S. 248, 254 (1981) \n(quoting Furnco Constr. Corp. v. Waters, 438 U.S. \n567, 577 (1978)).  Put another way, all the circuits \nare ultimately trained on the question of what\u2014if \nanything\u2014gives rise to an inference that the plaintiff \nis the minority or the outsider in the context of the \nspecific employment decision the lawsuit challenges.  \nFinally, any difference between the circuits, whether \nin language or substance, arose decades ago.  Despite \nthe longevity of any substantive difference, the cir-\ncuit\u2019s varying formulations rarely, if ever change liti-\ngation outcomes.   \nSTATEMENT \nMarlean Ames worked for the Ohio Department \nof Youth Services in a variety of roles.  Pet.App3a.  \nShe was working as the Administrator of the De-\n\n4 \n \npartment\u2019s Prison Rape Elimination Act program \nwhen the Department created a new position, the \nBureau Chief of Quality Assurance and Improve-\nment.  Pet.App.18a.  Ames applied for the new posi-\ntion.  Id. \nThe Bureau Chief position was a management \nrole that was intended to supervise and guide the \nother members of the Office of Quality and Im-\nprovement.  Pet.App.19a.  Among the key skills that \nthe Department was looking for in a successful can-\ndidate were management, supervision, and workforce \nplanning.  Id.  Ames was one of three people who ap-\nplied for the Bureau Chief job.  Id.  None of them \nwere hired.  Pet.App.20a.  Because there was no \ntimeline for filling the position, the Department de-\ncided to wait to hire someone until an ideal candidate \ncould be found.  Id.   \nSix months after Ames had interviewed for the \nBureau Chief role, the Department hired Yolanda \nFrierson for the job.  Pet.App.20a.  Julie Walburn, \nthe assistant director of the Department, made the \ndecision to hire Frierson.  See Pet.App.18a, 20a\u201321a.  \nAlthough Frierson did not interview for the Bureau \nChief job, Walburn had worked with Frierson in the \npast.  Pet.App.21a.  Walburn felt that Frierson would \nbe a good fit for the role because, among other things, \nFrierson had significant management experience.  \nId.  Although Frierson and Ames were both women, \nFrierson, unlike Ames, was gay.  Id. \nNot long after Ames interviewed for the Bureau \nChief position, she was removed from her role admin-\nistering the Prison Rape Elimination Act program.  \nPet.App.4a.  When the Governor appointed a new Di-\nrector of the Department, he had stressed to that Di-\n\n5 \n \nrector, Ryan Gies, that addressing sexual victimiza-\ntion within the juvenile corrections system was a \nhigh priority.  See Pet.App.18a, 21a\u201322a.  Gies there-\nfore began restructuring the Department\u2019s programs.  \nPet.App.21a\u201322a.   \nIt was that restructuring that cost Ames her posi-\ntion.  Pet.App.22a.  Gies felt that Ames was difficult \nto work with.  Id.  And Walburn was concerned that \nAmes could not oversee a more proactive approach to \ncomplying with the Prison Rape Elimination Act.  Id.  \nAmes was reassigned to a different role within the \nDepartment, one that she had previously held and \nthat paid less, Pet.App.18a, and Alex Stojsavljevic \nwas selected to oversee the Prison Rape Elimination \nAct program, Pet.App.23a.  Stojsavljevic is a gay \nman.  See id. \nAmes filed a complaint with the Equal Opportuni-\nty Commission and received a right-to-sue letter.  \nPet.App.4a.  Ames then filed a complaint in federal \ndistrict court.  Id.  As is relevant here, Ames\u2019s com-\nplaint alleged that the Department discriminated \nagainst her on the basis of sexual orientation (which \nis a form of sex discrimination) when it hired Fri-\nerson for the Bureau Chief role (call this her \u201cpromo-\ntion claim\u201d) and that it discriminated against her on \nthe basis of both sex and sexual orientation when it \ndemoted her and replaced her with Stojsavljevic (call \nthis her \u201cdemotion claim\u201d).  Pet.App.5a, 6a.  The dis-\ntrict court granted summary judgment in the De-\npartment\u2019s favor on both claims, see Pet.App.33a, \n39a\u201340a, and the Sixth Circuit affirmed, Pet.App.3a. \nAmes\u2019s claim related to the Bureau Chief position \nfailed, the Sixth Circuit held, because Ames could not \nmake \na \nprima \nfacie \ncase \nof \ndiscrimination.  \n\n6 \n \nPet.App.5a\u20136a.  Under Sixth Circuit precedent, a \nmajority-group plaintiff like Ames must identify evi-\ndence that would \u201csupport the suspicion that the de-\nfendant is that unusual employer who discriminates \nagainst the majority.\u201d  Pet.App.5a (quoting Arendale \nv. City of Memphis, 519 F.3d 587, 603 (6th Cir. \n2008)).  Ames, the Sixth Circuit held, had not.  \nPet.App.5a\u20136a.  Ames conceded in the district court \nthat Walburn and Gies, neither of whom are gay, \nwere the ones who were responsible for hiring Fri-\nerson. see Opposition to Motion for Summary Judg-\nment, R.72, PageID#2488 n.1.  Ames attempted to \nwalk back that admission on appeal.  She argued in \nthe Sixth Circuit that she had demonstrated back-\nground circumstances of discrimination because a \ndifferent individual made the decision to hire Fri-\nerson and that individual was gay.  See Pet.App.6a.  \nThe Sixth Circuit held, however, that Ames\u2019s conces-\nsion in the district court meant that she had forfeited \nthat argument for purposes of appeal.  Id.   \nThe Sixth Circuit held that Ames\u2019s demotion \nclaim failed for the same reason, at least to the ex-\ntent that Ames alleged that the Department discrim-\ninated against her on the basis of her sexual orienta-\ntion when it replaced her with Stojsavljevic.  See \nPet.App.6a.  But because Ames had also alleged that \nthe Department discriminated against her on the ba-\nsis of sex when it demoted her and selected a man to \nfill her prior position, the Sixth Circuit considered \nthe Department\u2019s proffered reasons for that employ-\nment action.  Pet.App.6a\u20139a.  It held that Ames \nfailed to carry her burden of showing that the De-\npartment discriminated against her.  Id.  The De-\npartment, the Sixth Circuit held, had legitimate, \nnondiscriminatory, reasons for demoting Ames and \n\n7 \n \nhiring Stojsavljevic and Ames failed to introduce any \nevidence that would suggest that those reasons were \npretextual.  See id. \nJudge Kethledge concurred.  Although he joined \nthe opinion in full, he wrote that he disagreed with \nSixth Circuit precedent to the extent that it required \nAmes to show, as part of her prima facie case of sex-\nual-orientation discrimination, that the Department \n\u201cis the unusual employer that discriminates against \nthe majority.\u201d  Pet.App.9a (quotation omitted). \nAmes has now filed a petition for a writ of certio-\nrari in which she challenges the Sixth Circuit\u2019s prec-\nedent, which includes a \u201cbackground circumstances\u201d \ncomponent for employment-discrimination claims to \nproceed down the McDonnell Douglas path if the \nplaintiff is a member of a majority group.  That prec-\nedent required her to point to something that indi-\ncated that the Department was the unusual employ-\ner that discriminates against the majority.  See Pet.i.  \nBut the Question Presented does not challenge the \nportion of the Sixth Circuit\u2019s decision that held that \nthe Department had legitimate, nondiscriminatory \nreasons for demoting Ames and replacing her with \nStojsavljevic.  See, generally, Pet.   \nREASONS FOR DENYING THE PETITION \nI. \nThis case provides a poor vehicle with \nwhich to address the Question Presented. \nThis case has numerous vehicle problems that \nmake it a poor case in which to consider the Question \nPresented.  Any one of those problems provides a \nreason to deny Ames\u2019s petition for a writ of certiorari. \nThe context for these vehicle flaws includes both \nlegal and factual background. \n\n8 \n \nLegally, these flaws intersect with this Court\u2019s \nfrequently invoked tool for assessing discrimination \nclaims in McDonnell Douglas.  All Title VII plaintiffs, \nregardless of the group to which they belong, bear \nthe \u201cultimate burden of persuading the trier of fact \nthat \nthe \ndefendant \nintentionally \ndiscriminated \nagainst\u201d them.  Burdine, 450 U.S. at 253.  The Court \nin McDonnell Douglas adopted a three-step analysis \nto assist courts in reviewing Title VII claims.  At the \nfirst step, a plaintiff bears the burden of establishing \na prima facie case of discrimination.  411 U.S. at 802.  \nOnce she does so, the employer must offer a legiti-\nmate, nondiscriminatory, reason for its actions.  Id. \nat 802\u201303. The plaintiff then bears the burden of \nshowing that the employer\u2019s reasons were pretextual.  \nId. at 804.  McDonnell Douglas\u2019s test was \u201cnever in-\ntended to be rigid, mechanized, or ritualistic,\u201d how-\never; it was simply intended to be \u201ca sensible, orderly \nway to evaluate the evidence in light of common ex-\nperience as it bears on the critical question of dis-\ncrimination.\u201d  Furnco Constr. Corp. v. Waters, 438 \nU.S. 567, 577 (1978). \nFactually, these flaws intersect with Ames\u2019s two \nclaimed acts of employment discrimination.  Recall \nthat she initially challenged both the Department\u2019s \ndecision to promote a different person and the De-\npartment\u2019s decision to demote her when it picked a \ndifferent person to fill Ames\u2019s former role.  Ames \nchallenged the promotion decision as illegal sexual-\norientation discrimination and challenged the demo-\ntion decision as both illegal sex and sexual-\norientation discrimination.  And while the Sixth Cir-\ncuit affirmed judgment against Ames on her orienta-\ntion theories for failing the prima facie inquiry with \nrespect to both her promotion and demotion claims, it \n\n9 \n \naffirmed \njudgment \nagainst \nher \non \nthe \nsex-\ndiscrimination theory because Ames could not show \nany pretext in the Department\u2019s decision to demote \nher and to select someone to replace her at her for-\nmer position.  See Pet.App.7a\u20138a.  The Sixth Circuit, \nthat is, rejected Ames\u2019s claim that the Department \ndiscriminated against her when it demoted her.   \nIn this Court, Ames\u2019s Question Presented targets \nonly a component of the prima facie showing.  The \nconsequence of that choice is that Ames cannot chal-\nlenge the Department\u2019s decision to demote her be-\ncause she has not challenged the lower court\u2019s hold-\nings that the demotion decision involved no pretext \n(and thus no discrimination).    \nWith that legal and factual setting, the following \nfour vehicle flaws point against granting review. \nA. \nAmes did not challenge the Sixth \nCircuit\u2019s prima facie test below. \nAmes never challenged the Sixth Circuit\u2019s \u201cback-\nground circumstances\u201d element below.  She argued \ninstead that she satisfied that requirement.  While \nAmes\u2019s litigation strategy may not have forfeited her \nQuestion Presented in the strictest sense, it still \nmakes this case a poor vehicle with which to consider \nthat question. \nThe Court has indicated that parties need not al-\nways raise their arguments for the first time in the \ncircuit courts.  It has noted that there is no require-\nment that a \u201cparty demand overruling of a squarely \napplicable, recent circuit precedent, even though that \nprecedent was established in a case to which the par-\nty itself was privy and over the party\u2019s vigorous ob-\njection.\u201d  United States v. Williams, 504 U.S. 36, 44 \n\n10 \n \n(1992); see also United States v. Vonn, 535 U.S. 55, \n58 (2002).   \nEven if Ames was not required to challenge exist-\ning Sixth Circuit precedent, she at least should not \nbe able to benefit from her failure to do so.  But that, \nin effect, is what she seeks to do.  As discussed in \nmore detail below, the Sixth Circuit has taken a nu-\nanced approach to determining whether a majority-\ngroup plaintiff has identified background circum-\nstances that suggest discrimination.  See below at \n23\u201324, 33\u201335.  Among other things, it has held that \nthe \u201c[background circumstances] requirement is not \nonerous, and can be met through a variety of means.\u201d  \nJohnson v. Metro. Gov\u2019t of Nashville & Davidson \nCnty., 502 F. App\u2019x 523, 536 (6th Cir. 2012).  Had \nAmes argued that such a requirement is inconsistent \nwith Title VII, then the Sixth Circuit would have had \nthe opportunity to discuss its precedent in greater \ndetail.  It could have explained, for example, that the \n\u201cbackground circumstances\u201d requirement is not a \nhigher burden, merely a different one.  But because \nAmes did not raise that issue, the panel had no rea-\nson to reject her framing of the background circum-\nstances element of the prima facie test.  Put another \nway, one of the reasons that Ames is now able to crit-\nicize the decision below as overly stringent and in-\nflexible is because she herself framed it that way.  \nAnd while that is not waiver or forfeiture formally, \nthe fact that Ames \u201cdid not raise or brief\u201d the ques-\ntion presented \u201cbelow\u201d is a reason to deny certiorari.  \nHoggard v. Rhodes, 141 S. Ct. 2421, 2422 (2021) \n(Thomas, J., respecting the denial of certiorari). \n\n11 \n \nB. \nAnswering the Question Presented \nin Ames\u2019s favor would not change \nthe outcome in this case because \nAmes cannot satisfy a separate \ncomponent of the prima facie \nshowing. \nAmes has affirmatively waived any challenge to \nthe requirement that she establish a prima facie case \nof discrimination.  Pet.28 n.3.  Her only challenge is \nto how the Sixth Circuit applied one component of \nthat rubric in this case.  Ames\u2019s Question Presented \nasks whether, to establish a prima facie case of dis-\ncrimination under Title VII, a majority-group plain-\ntiff must introduce evidence of \u201cbackground circum-\nstances\u201d that suggest discrimination.  See Pet.i.  But \nthe answer to that question will not affect the out-\ncome of this case.  Even if the answer is \u201cno\u201d Ames \nstill could not make a prima facie case of sex discrim-\nination.  And that is a prime reason to deny certiora-\nri.  The Court should \u201cnot ... take up\u201d a question pre-\nsented if the claims underlying that question are \u201cin-\ndependently subject to\u201d defenses that would yield the \nsame result regardless of how the Court answers the \nquestion.  Blankenship v. NBCUniversal, LLC, 144 S. \nCt. 5, 6 (2023) (Thomas, J., concurring in the denial \nof certiorari) \nThere appears to be universal agreement that an \n\u201cemployer cannot intentionally discriminate on the \nbasis of a characteristic of which the employer has no \nknowledge.\u201d  Bostock v. Clayton Cty., 590 U.S. 644, \n691 (2020) (Alito, J., dissenting).  As far as the De-\npartment is aware, every circuit that has considered \nthe question has held that in \u201ccases involving per-\nsonal attributes not obvious to the employer,\u201d a \n\n12 \n \n\u201cplaintiff cannot make out a prima facie case of dis-\ncrimination unless he or she proves that the employ-\ner knew about the plaintiff\u2019s particular personal \ncharacteristic.\u201d  Geraci v. Moody-Tottrup, Int\u2019l, 82 \nF.3d 578, 581 (3d Cir. 1996); Hunter v. UPS, 697 \nF.3d 697, 703\u201304 (8th Cir. 2012); Robinson v. Adams, \n847 F.2d 1315, 1316 (9th Cir. 1987); Lubetsky v. Ap-\nplied Card Sys., 296 F.3d 1301, 1305\u201306 (11th Cir. \n2002); cf. also Raytheon Co. v. Hernandez, 540 U.S. \n44, 54 n.7 (2003) (\u201cIf [an employer] were truly una-\nware that \u2026 a disability existed, it would be impos-\nsible for her hiring decision to have been based, even \nin part, on [the employee\u2019s] disability.\u201d); Landefel v. \nMarion Gen. Hosp., Inc., 994 F.2d 1178, 1181\u201382 (6th \nCir. 1993) (same).  The reverse is also true.  An em-\nployer cannot discriminate in favor of a different em-\nployee if the employer has no knowledge of the fa-\nvored employee\u2019s personal characteristics.  See, e.g., \nPetrikonis v. Wilkes-Barre Hosp. Co., LLC, 582 F. \nApp\u2019x 126, 130 (3d Cir. 2014); Morrow v. Wal\u2013Mart \nStores, Inc., 152 F.3d 559, 563 (7th Cir.1998). \nAmes, however, introduced no evidence that \nwould create a genuine issue of material fact about \nwhether the relevant decisionmakers were aware of \nher sexual orientation, or of the orientation of Fri-\nerson, the person who was ultimately hired for the \njob to which Ames had applied.  The only evidence on \nthat point indicated just the opposite.  The only evi-\ndence related to Walburn\u2019s knowledge with respect to \neither woman showed that she was unaware of Fri-\nerson\u2019s sexual orientation (and was silent with re-\nspect to Ames).  See Motion for Summary Judgment, \nR.71, PageID#2375 (citing Walburn Depo. R.60, \nPageID#668).  And the only evidence related to oth-\ners\u2019 knowledge of Ames\u2019s sexual orientation showed \n\n13 \n \nthat her direct supervisor did not know whether \nAmes was gay or straight.  See id. at 2367 (citing \nTrim Depo., R.64, PageID#1511).  Ames\u2019s failure to \nintroduce any evidence on this point means that no \nmatter how the Court answers the Question Present-\ned her discrimination claim would still fail at the \nprima facia stage.   \nTo be sure, the Sixth Circuit noted that, if not for \nthe background circumstances element, then Ames\u2019s \nprima facie case would have been \u201ceasy to make.\u201d  \nSee Pet.App.5a.  It is clear from context, however, \nthat the Sixth Circuit was referring only to the ele-\nments of a prima facie case discussed in McDonnell \nDouglas.  See id.  Knowledge of an employee\u2019s per-\nsonal characteristics is an additional, threshold, re-\nquirement of a prima facie case, however, and one \nthat the Sixth Circuit did not discuss.  See id.; \nGeraci, 82 F.3d at 581 (noting that McDonnell Doug-\nlas \u201cquite properly makes no reference to the em-\nployer\u2019s knowledge of membership in a protected \nclass\u201d because some protected traits will be known to \nmanagement merely by seeing the employee).     \nC. \nEven if Ames could establish a \nprima facie case of discrimination, \nthe outcome of this case still would \nnot change. \nA favorable answer to the Question Presented \nwould not change the result here for a second, inde-\npendent reason\u2014Ames\u2019s claim fails at the later stag-\nes of McDonnell Douglas.  Even if Ames could make \na prima facie case of discrimination, her promotion \nclaim would fail at McDonnell Douglas\u2019s second and \nthird stages.   \n\n14 \n \nThe Department had nondiscriminatory reasons \nfor its hiring decision and Ames cannot show that \nthose reasons were pretextual.  True, the concur-\nrence suggested otherwise below, Pet.App.10a, and \nAmes now makes a similar argument in her petition, \nsee Pet.32.  But they are both off base.  In response to \nthe Department\u2019s motion for summary judgment, \nAmes failed to point to any evidence that created a \ngenuine issue of material fact about whether the De-\npartment\u2019s decision to hire Frierson (instead of \nAmes) was pretextual.  Indeed, Ames did the oppo-\nsite.  She accepted the Department\u2019s recitation of the \nrelevant facts in its summary judgment motion as \ncorrect (with the exception of two minor issues that \nare not relevant here).  See Opposition to Motion for \nSummary Judgment, R.72, PageID#2488 n.1.   \nTo the extent that the concurrence below suggest-\ned that Ames\u2019s case faltered only at the prima facie \nshowing\u2019s step one, it was confused about the facts \nand evidence presented at summary judgment.  The \nconcurrence identified two factors that, it believed, \nprovided strong evidence of pretext: that the De-\npartment twice promoted a gay employee in a \u201cman-\nner adverse to Ames\u201d and that Frierson lacked the \nminimum qualifications for the job for which she was \nhired.  It was wrong on both counts. \nThe first factor\u2014which involved replacing Ames \nas the administrator of the Prison Rape Elimination \nAct program\u2014was irrelevant.  The Sixth Circuit held \nthat the Department had legitimate, nondiscrimina-\ntory, reasons for hiring Stojsavljevic, the other gay \nindividual that the concurrence referenced, for that \nposition, and Ames has not challenged that portion of \nthe Sixth Circuit\u2019s decision through her Question \n\n15 \n \nPresented.  Because it is now settled that the De-\npartment did not discriminate against Ames when it \nhired Stojsavljevic, that hiring decision cannot serve \nas evidence that the Department\u2019s other actions were \npretextual.  See Pet.12 n.2 (waiving any challenge to \nthe Sixth Circuit\u2019s sex discrimination ruling).   \nAs for the concurrence\u2019s second factor, it misread \nthe record when it stated that Frierson \u201clacked the \nminimum qualifications for the job\u201d for which she \nwas hired.  See Pet.App.10a.  The undisputed evi-\ndence showed that Frierson was qualified.  The job \nposting listed alternative qualifications: an applicant \nwas required to have either a college degree or rele-\nvant work experience.  Motion for Summary Judg-\nment, East Decl., R.71-4, PageID#2419.  And while \nFrierson did not have a degree, she did have the ex-\nperience.  Motion for Summary Judgment, East \nDecl., R.71-5, PageID#2460\u201368.  It was that experi-\nence, in fact, that led the Department to hire her.  \nWalburn Depo., R.60, PageID#635\u201337, 639.  Ames \nmay have argued in the Sixth Circuit that Frierson \nwas not qualified, but she did not introduce any evi-\ndence that created a genuine issue of material fact \nabout Frierson\u2019s qualifications.  Cf. Ames Opposition \nto Summary Judgment, R.72, PageID#2488 (conced-\ning that \u201c[t]he Statement of Facts included in the De-\nfendant\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment is largely \ncorrect\u201d).  Ames\u2019s argument was different in the dis-\ntrict court.  Ames never argued in the district court \nthat Frierson was unqualified.  See Opposition to \nMotion for Summary Judgment, R.72, PageID#2495\u2013\n96.  She argued only that she was more qualified \nthan Frierson was.  Id.  \n\n16 \n \nBecause the Sixth Circuit would likely \u201chave \nreached the same conclusion\u201d that the Department \nshould prevail on summary judgment even if it \nagreed with Ames, certiorari is unwarranted.  See, \ne.g., Hittson v. Chatman, 576 U.S. 1028 (2015) (Gins-\nburg, J., concurring in the denial of certiorari). \nD. \nAmes fails to distinguish between \nthe portion of the Sixth Circuit\u2019s \ndecision that she has challenged \nand the portion that she has not. \nThe Sixth Circuit below considered two separate \ndiscrimination claims and rejected them both.  It \nheld that Ames had failed to make a prima facie case \nof discrimination with respect to her promotion \nclaim.  It also held that Ames had failed to show that \nthe Department\u2019s decision to demote and replace her \nwas discriminatory.  Ames\u2019s demotion claim rested \non two theories of discrimination: sex and sexual ori-\nentation.  But although the Sixth Circuit held that \nAmes had established a prima facie case of discrimi-\nnation only with respect to her sex-discrimination \ntheory, that does not matter; the same nondiscrimi-\nnatory reasons were sufficient to resolve Ames\u2019s sex \nand sexual orientation theories.  Title VII claims \nchallenge employment actions.  See 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a72000e-2(a).  And, generally, the \u201csame legitimate, \nnondiscriminatory reasons that [an employer] ad-\nvance[d] against a finding of \u2026 discrimination apply \nequally to\u201d all similar claims of discrimination aris-\ning from the same event, even if the protected class \nthat provides the basis for the claim differs.  Cf. Hrd-\nlicka v. GM LLC, 63 F.4th 555, 575 (6th Cir. 2023). \nAmes has not challenged the portion of the Sixth \nCircuit\u2019s decision that held that the Department had \n\n17 \n \nnondiscriminatory reasons for demoting her.  The \nQuestion Presented therefore involves only Ames\u2019s \nclaim that the Department discriminated against her \nwhen it promoted Frierson instead of her.  See Pet.i.  \nIn other words, it involves only her promotion claim, \nnot her demotion claim.   \nAmes confuses the Question Presented in this \ncase by suggesting otherwise.  Ames writes that this \ncase involves a \u201cdemotion decision.\u201d  See Pet.32.  Not \nso.  The demotion decision she references involves \nthe demotion claim that she has not challenged \nthrough her Question Presented.  Ames\u2019s failure to \nproperly distinguish between the claim that is before \nthe court, and the one that is not, provides just one \nmore reason why this case provides a poor vehicle to \naddress the Question Presented.  \u201c[A]t the very least\u201d \nAmes\u2019s litigation strategy \u201cwould complicate [the \nCourt\u2019s] review.\u201d  Gordon Coll. v. DeWeese-Boyd, 142 \nS. Ct. 952 (2022) (Alito, J., respecting the denial of \ncertiorari).  And that is reason enough to deny certio-\nrari. \nII. \nThere is no meaningful circuit split; the \ndifferences between the circuits are \nlargely differences in language not law. \nThe Court should deny certiorari even if this \ncase\u2019s vehicle problems did not otherwise render it \nnon-cert worthy.  Ames claims to spy a circuit split \nwith respect to the relevant prima facie test for dis-\ncrimination claims brought by members of a majority \ngroup.  But any differences between the circuits are \nmore differences of terminology than consequential \nlegal substance.   Regardless of the long-standing dif-\nference in language that some circuits use, the out-\ncome is largely the same. \n\n18 \n \nA. \nThis Court\u2019s precedent instructs \nthat the McDonnell Douglas test is \na flexible one.  \nThis Court\u2019s decision in McDonnell Douglas pro-\nvides the foundation for a large majority of Title VII \nclaims.  Ames does not dispute that every circuit, \neven those that she alleges conflict with one another, \napplies that decision to at least some degree.  To the \nextent that Ames alleges that a split exists, it is a \nsplit over how the various circuits apply McDonnell \nDouglas.  Before addressing Ames\u2019s claimed split, \nsome background about that decision, and the \nCourt\u2019s precedent interpreting and applying it, is \ntherefore needed. \nBecause direct evidence of discrimination \u201c\u2018essen-\ntially requires an admission by the employer,\u2019 such \nevidence \u2018is rare.\u2019\u201d  Argyropoulos v. City of Alton, 539 \nF.3d 724, 733 (7th Cir. 2008) (citations omitted). \nThat is one reason why the Court adopted what is \nnow known as the McDonnell Douglas test.  Under \nthat test, a plaintiff may rely on indirect evidence to \nprove a discrimination claim.  The first step of \nMcDonnell Douglas\u2019s test requires a plaintiff to es-\ntablish a prima facie case of discrimination by show-\ning four things: \u201c(i) that he belongs to a racial minor-\nity; (ii) that he applied and was qualified for a job for \nwhich the employer was seeking applicants; (iii) that, \ndespite his qualifications, he was rejected; and (iv) \nthat, after his rejection, the position remained open \nand the employer continued to seek applicants from \npersons of complainant\u2019s qualifications.\u201d  McDonnell \nDouglas, 411 U.S. at 802.  But because \u201cfacts neces-\nsarily will vary in Title VII cases,\u201d the Court in \nMcDonnell Douglas acknowledged that the four-part \n\n19 \n \ntest it laid out will not apply \u201cin every respect to dif-\nfering factual situations.\u201d  Id. at 802 n.13.  Indeed, \npart one \u201cof this sample pattern of proof was set out \nonly to demonstrate how the racial character of the \ndiscrimination could be established in the most \ncommon sort of case, and not as an indication of any \nsubstantive limitation of Title VII\u2019s prohibition of ra-\ncial discrimination.\u201d  McDonald, 427 U.S. at 279 n.6 \n(1976) \nThe Court\u2019s subsequent decisions reaffirmed that \nMcDonnell Douglas was \u201c\u2018never intended to be rigid, \nmechanized, or ritualistic. Rather, it is merely a sen-\nsible, orderly way to evaluate the evidence in light of \ncommon experience as it bears on the critical ques-\ntion of discrimination.\u2019\u201d  USPS Bd. of Governors v. \nAikens, 460 U.S. 711, 715 (1983) (quoting Furnco, \n438 U.S. at 577).  The relevant question in Title VII \ncases is \u201calways whether the employer is treating \n\u2018some people less favorably than others because of \ntheir race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.\u2019\u201d \nFurnco, 438 U.S. at 577 (quoting Int\u2019l Brotherhood of \nTeamsters v. United States, 431 U.S. 324, 335 n.15 \n(1977)).  A plaintiff makes out a prima facie case of \ndiscrimination under McDonnell Douglas and Title \nVII by \u201cshowing actions taken by the employer from \nwhich one can infer, if such actions remain unex-\nplained, that it is more likely than not that such ac-\ntions were \u2018based on a discriminatory criterion illegal \nunder the Act.\u2019\u201d  Furnco, 438 U.S. at 576 (quoting \nTeamsters, 431 U.S. at 358); see also Young v. UPS, \n575 U.S. 206, 228 (2015) (same).  McDonnell Douglas \nis not an end in itself; it exists simply to eliminate \n\u201cthe most common nondiscriminatory reasons for the \nplaintiff\u2019s rejection.\u201d  Burdine, 450 U.S. at 253\u201354.   \n\n20 \n \nConsistent with the Court\u2019s precedent, lower \ncourts have modified McDonnell Douglas\u2019s test as \nnecessary to account for a specific plaintiff\u2019s discrim-\nination claims.  They have, for example, adopted \nmodified versions of the McDonnell Douglas test to \ngovern discriminatory promotion claims, Bundy v. \nJackson, 641 F.2d 934, 951 (D.C. Cir. 1981), retalia-\ntion claims, Laster v. City of Kalamazoo, 746 F.3d \n714, 730 (6th Cir. 2014), and discriminatory disci-\npline claims, Reives v. Illinois State Police, 29 F.4th \n887, 891\u201392 (7th Cir. 2022); see also Murray v. This-\ntledown Racing Club, Inc., 770 F.2d 63, 67 (6th Cir. \n1985) (noting that \u201ccourts have modified the McDon-\nnell Douglas standard to address disparate treat-\nment cases involving all discrimination prohibited by \nthe Act in promotion, firing, compensation or other \nconditions of employment\u201d). \nOne other modification involves claims by majori-\nty-group plaintiffs;  what some call \u201creverse\u201d discrim-\nination.  It is impossible to apply McDonnell Douglas \nliterally to such cases. The first prong of the McDon-\nnell Douglas prima facie test asks, after all, whether \nthe plaintiff was a \u201cracial minority.\u201d  McDonnell \nDouglas, 411 U.S. at 802; see also Parker v. Balti-\nmore & Ohio R. Co., 652 F.2d 1012, 1017 (D.C. Cir. \n1981).  Courts must therefore always adapt McDon-\nnell Douglas to at least some degree when they are \nconfronted with a \u201creverse\u201d discrimination claim.  \nThe Sixth Circuit, like many courts around the coun-\ntry, has adopted a prima facie test to govern discrim-\nination claims filed by members of a majority group \nwho allege that they were discriminated against in \nfavor of a minority group.  Those courts require a \nplaintiff who alleges discrimination based on the \nplaintiff\u2019s membership in a majority group to point to \n\n21 \n \nbackground circumstances that provide some evi-\ndence to \u201csupport the suspicion that the defendant is \nthat unusual employer who discriminates against the \nmajority.\u201d  Thistledown Racing, 770 F.2d at 67 (quot-\ning Parker, 652 F.2d at 1017).  This requirement is \noften shorthanded as simply a \u201cbackground circum-\nstances\u201d requirement.  But regardless of its label, a \nmajority plaintiff\u2019s burden, like the burden minority \nplaintiffs bear, is \u201cnot onerous.\u201d  Compare Johnson, \n502 F. App\u2019x at 536 with Burdine, 450 U.S. at 253. \nB. \nThere is no meaningful \ndisagreement between the circuits \nabout the ultimate legal standard \nthat McDonnell Douglas \nestablished. \nAmes argues that there is a split over how Courts \nhave applied McDonnell Douglas to \u201creverse\u201d dis-\ncrimination claims.  She groups the circuits into \nthree categories 1) circuits that have adopted a \n\u201cbackground circumstances\u201d requirement, 2) circuits \nthat she claims do not apply a \u201cbackground circum-\nstances\u201d requirement, and 3) circuits that have ex-\nplicitly rejected such a requirement.  See Pet.14\u201325  \nA close examination of the cases she cites reveals, \nhowever, that even though some circuits have used \ndifferent language to describe their approach, they \nultimately all focus on the same basic legal question: \nare there facts from which one can \u201cinfer, if such ac-\ntions remain unexplained, that it is more likely than \nnot that [an employer\u2019s] actions were based on a dis-\ncriminatory criterion illegal under\u201d Title VII.  \nFurnco, 438 U.S. at 576 (quotation omitted). \n\n22 \n \n1. \nIn \u201creverse\u201d discrimination \ncases, the Sixth, Seventh, \nEighth, Tenth, and D.C. \nCircuits describe the prima \nfacie case\u2019s first step as a \nshowing about background \ncircumstances. \nThe D.C. Circuit was one of the first courts to ap-\nply McDonnell Douglas to a \u201creverse\u201d discrimination \nclaim.  It noted that \u201c[m]embership in a socially dis-\nfavored group was the assumption on which the en-\ntire McDonnell Douglas analysis was predicated,\u201d \nand that the first element of the prima facie test \ntherefore necessarily needed to adapt when a mem-\nber of a majority group filed a Title VII claim.  Par-\nker, 652 F.2d at 1017   Applying a modified version of \nMcDonnell Douglas, it held that a plaintiff who is a \nmember of a majority group makes out a prima facie \nshowing of discrimination when she demonstrates \nthat \u201cbackground circumstances support the suspi-\ncion that the defendant is that unusual employer \nwho discriminates against the majority.\u201d  See id.  \nSuch circumstances, the D.C. Circuit wrote, \u201cserved \nas a functional equivalent of the first McDonnell \nDouglas criterion, membership in a racial minority.\u201d  \nId. at 1018.  Applying that standard, the court held \nthat the plaintiff in Parker made out a prima facie \ncase of discrimination when he pointed to a racially \ndiscriminatory work environment.  Id.  Subsequent \nD.C. Circuit decisions made clear that the \u201cback-\nground circumstances\u201d element is not intended to \ndisadvantage plaintiffs who are members of majority \ngroups, nor is it \u201can additional hurdle.\u201d  Harding v. \nGray, 9 F.3d 150, 153\u201354 (D.C. Cir. 1993).  It is simp-\nly a tool for \u201cdetermining when an employer\u2019s con-\n\n23 \n \nduct raises an inference of discrimination under the \nSupreme \nCourt\u2019s \nMcDonnell \nDouglas/Burdine \nstandard.\u201d  Id. at 153.  \nFollowing Parker, the Sixth, Seventh, Eighth, and \nTenth circuits have used the \u201cbackground circum-\nstances\u201d language to describe the first component of \na prima facie analysis for \u201creverse\u201d discrimination \nclaims.  Like the D.C. Circuit, however, those circuits \nhave emphasized that \u201cbackground circumstances\u201d \ncomponent is easily satisfied.  Most significantly for \npurposes of this case, the Sixth Circuit has held that \nthe background circumstances \u201crequirement is not \nonerous, and can be met through a variety of means.\u201d  \nJohnson, 502 F. App\u2019x at 536.  A male plaintiff in a \nfailure-to-hire case, for example, can satisfy the re-\nquirement by showing that the decisionmaker and \nthe person ultimately hired were both women.  See \nPet.App.6a.  He can demonstrate \u201cbackground cir-\ncumstances,\u201d in other words, by showing that he was \nin the minority in the relevant sense. \nThe Sixth Circuit\u2019s recent decisions, which make \nclear that a plaintiff\u2019s burden is not onerous, also put \nto rest any concerns in older Sixth Circuit decisions \nthat majority-group plaintiffs may bear a high bur-\nden.  See Pierce v. Commonwealth Life Ins. Co., 40 \nF.3d 796, 801 n.7 (6th Cir. 1994); cf. Briggs v. Porter, \n463 F.3d 507, 517 (6th Cir. 2006) (describing a plain-\ntiff\u2019s burden as \u201cmore difficult\u201d).  To the extent that \nthe Sixth Circuit in past decades may have expressed \nmisgivings about the \u201cbackground circumstances\u201d \nanalysis, its more recent decisions have clarified the \nshowing\u2019s low bar.  See Johnson, 502 F. App\u2019x at 536. \nThe Seventh, Eighth, and Tenth Circuits also do \nnot treat the background circumstances requirement \n\n24 \n \nas onerous.  They too look to it as nothing more than \na substitute for otherwise inapplicable elements of \nthe prima facie test discussed in McDonnell Douglas.  \nThe Seventh Circuit, in adopting a background cir-\ncumstances requirement, emphasized that the re-\nquirement \u201cis not to be interpreted in a constricting \nfashion.\u201d  Mills v. Health Care Serv. Corp., 171 F.3d \n450, 457 (7th Cir. 1999).  And the Eighth Circuit and \nTenth Circuits have likewise treated the background \ncircumstances component of a prima facie case not as \na \u201chigher\u201d or \u201cadditional\u201d burden, but simply an al-\nternative showing that plaintiffs must make \u201cin lieu \nof\u201d showing that the plaintiff belongs to a minority \ngroup.  Notari v. Denver Water Dep\u2019t., 971 F.2d 585, \n589 (10th Cir. 1992); Hammer v. Ashcroft, 383 F.3d \n722, 724 (8th Cir. 2004); see also Duffy v. Wolle, 123 \nF.3d 1026, 1035\u201337 (8th Cir. 1997) (applying \nMcDonnell Douglas framework to a Bivens v. Six \nUnknown Fed. Narcotics Agents, 403 U.S. 388, (1971) \nclaim). \nMost significantly, none of the circuits that use \nthe \u201cbackground circumstances\u201d language dispute \nthat plaintiffs who are members of a majority group \nare \u201centitled to the same Title VII protection as a \nminority plaintiff.\u201d  Harding, 9 F.3d at 153; see also \nThistledown Racing, 770 F.2d at 67 (\u201cTitle VII, of \ncourse, prohibits racial discrimination against all \ngroups\u201d); Mills, 171 F.3d at 454\u201355 (\u201c[I]t is well set-\ntled law that the protections of Title VII are not lim-\nited to members of historically discriminated-against \ngroups.\u201d); Schaffhauser v. UPS, 794 F.3d 899, 902 \n(8th Cir. 2015) (\u201cTitle VII prohibits an employer from \ndiscriminating against any individual \u2018because of \nsuch individual\u2019s race.\u2019\u201d (emphasis added)); Notari, \n971 F.2d at 588 (noting that \u201cit is clear that Title \n\n25 \n \nVII\u2019s protection is not limited to those individuals \nwho are members of historically or socially disfa-\nvored groups\u201d). \n2. \nThe Third and Eleventh \nCircuits are in accord with \nthe other circuits. \nAmes argues that there is a direct conflict be-\ntween the Third and Eleventh Circuits and those cir-\ncuits that apply a \u201cbackground circumstances\u201d re-\nquirement as part of the prima facie test for \u201creverse\u201d \ndiscrimination claims.  The Third and Eleventh cir-\ncuits, she claims have \u201cexplicitly rejected\u201d such a re-\nquirement.  Pet.19.  Ames overreads those decisions.  \nWhile the Third and Eleventh Circuits have chosen \nnot to apply an explicit \u201cbackground circumstances\u201d \nrequirement, those circuits still apply the same basic \nTitle VII standard that other circuits apply. \nThe Third Circuit, it is true, has declined to adopt \nthe \u201cbackground circumstances\u201d language in \u201cre-\nverse\u201d discrimination cases.  Iadimarco v. Runyon, \n190 F.3d 151, 160 (3d Cir. 1999).  But it has never-\ntheless recognized that there are problems with the \n\u201cwording of the very first prong of the McDonnell \nDouglas [prima facie] test\u201d that mandate at least \nsome modification of that test with respect to \u201cre-\nverse\u201d discrimination claims.  Id. at 158.  Rather \nthan use the language of \u201cbackground circumstanc-\nes,\u201d however, it has held that a Title VII plaintiff \n\u201cshould be able to establish a prima facie case \u2026 by \npresenting sufficient evidence to allow a reasonable \nfact finder to conclude (given the totality of the cir-\ncumstances) that the defendant treated [a] plaintiff \n\u2018less favorably than others because of [his] race, col-\nor, religion, sex, or national origin.\u2019\u201d  Id. at 163 (quot-\n\n26 \n \ning Furnco, 438 U.S. at 577).  That is not meaning-\nfully different from the legal standard that other cir-\ncuits apply.  The Third Circuit in fact acknowledged \nthat the background-circumstances requirement, as \napplied by the circuits that have adopted it, often re-\nquires only that a plaintiff offer \u201csufficient evidence \nto support the reasonable probability of discrimina-\ntion.\u201d  Id. at 162. \nAt least one member of the Iadimarco panel be-\nlieved the primary difference between the test that \nthe Third Circuit adopted and the \u201cbackground cir-\ncumstances\u201d test was their wording and that the \nThird Circuit\u2019s test was \u201cmerely a restatement of the \nMcDonnell Douglas test.\u201d  Id. at 163 n.10.  That \nmember of the panel rejected the \u201cbackground cir-\ncumstances\u201d phrasing not because it was necessarily \nan incorrect statement of law, but because its fram-\ning was \u201cjust too vague and too prone to misinterpre-\ntation and confusion to apply fairly and consistently.\u201d  \nId.   \nThe other Third Circuit decisions that Ames cites \nalso do not support her claimed split.  The Third Cir-\ncuit did not discuss \u201cbackground circumstances\u201d at \nall in Phillips v. Legacy Cabinets, 87 F.4th 1313 \n(11th Cir. 2023).  Even if it had, it would not have \nmattered.  Because the plaintiff and the relevant de-\ncisionmaker were of different races, see id. at 1316, \nthe plaintiff would have been able to demonstrate \nbackground \ncircumstances \nin \nany \nevent, \nsee \nPet.App.5a.  Ellis v. Bank of N.Y. Mellon Corp, is \neven less relevant; all that the Third Circuit did in \nthat case was state the obvious proposition that a \n\u201creverse\u201d discrimination plaintiff \u201cneed not show she \n\n27 \n \nis a member of a minority group.\u201d  837 F. App\u2019x 940, \n941 n.3 (2021). \nThe Eleventh Circuit decisions that Ames cites \nare of even less relevance.  Two of the cases did not \ninvolve McDonnell Douglas\u2019s prima facie test at all.  \nBass v. Bd. of County Comm\u2019rs, 256 F.3d 1095, 1104  \n(11th Cir. 2001) (\u201cIn this case, the County has not \ndisputed that Bass established a prima facie case of \ndiscrimination under the McDonnell Douglas frame-\nwork.\u201d); Smith v. Lockheed-Martin Corp., 644 F.3d \n1321, 1328 (11th Cir. 2011) (\u201cHere, Mitten did not \nneed to rely on the McDonnell Douglas presumption \nto establish a case for the jury.\u201d).  Any discussion of \nthe \u201cbackground circumstances\u201d element in those de-\ncisions was therefore dicta.  But even then, to the ex-\ntent that the Eleventh District in Bass \u201cexplicitly\u201d \nrejected anything, it was the \u201creverse discrimination\u201d \nlabel.  See Bass, 256 F.3d at 1102\u201303.  Its decision, in \nthat respect, was little more than an uncontroversial \nrecognition that Title VII applies equally to all plain-\ntiffs.  See id.  And Smith, for its part, simply cited \nBass for the principle that a plaintiff need not show \n\u201cbackground circumstances\u201d that suggest discrimina-\ntion.  See 644 F.3d at 1325 n.15.  But if Bass did not \ndecide that question, then neither can it be said did \nSmith. \nDicta aside, the legal test that the Eleventh Cir-\ncuit applied in Smith is, in practice, functionally sim-\nilar to the test that other circuits apply.  It held that \na plaintiff can prevail on a discrimination claim if \n\u201cthe record, viewed in a light most favorable to the \nplaintiff, presents \u2018a convincing mosaic of circum-\nstantial evidence that would allow a jury to infer in-\ntentional discrimination by the decisionmaker.\u2019\u201d  \n\n28 \n \nSmith, 644 F.3d at 1328.  And in other cases, the \nEleventh Circuit has held that its \u201cmosaic\u201d standard \naddresses the same question as \u201cwhen using the \nMcDonnell Douglas framework.\u201d  Tynes v. Fla. Dep\u2019t \nof Juvenile Justice, 88 F.4th 939, 947 (2023).  To be \nsure, some members of the Eleventh Circuit would go \neven further and would abandon McDonnell Douglas \ncompletely.  See id. at 949\u201358 (Newsome, J., concur-\nring).  But whether McDonnell Douglas has outlived \nits usefulness is a question that must wait for anoth-\ner day\u2014and for a party to raise it.  Ames has explic-\nitly declined to do so here.  See Pet.28 n.3. \n3. \nThe First, Second, Fourth, \nFifth, and Ninth Circuits \napply a largely similar prima \nfacie standard. \nAmes identifies two different categories of circuits \nthat, she claims, have implicitly rejected a back-\nground circumstances requirement: those that have \ndeclined to decide whether to apply such a require-\nment and those that have been entirely silent on the \nquestion.  See Pet.22\u201323.   \na. The Second, Fourth, and Ninth Circuits are in \nthe first category of cases.  They have acknowledged \nthe \u201cbackground circumstances\u201d requirement but \nhave not decided whether such a requirement should \nbe part of the prima facie test for \u201creverse\u201d discrimi-\nnation claims.  The fact that they have not taken a \nposition on the Question Presented means, by defini-\ntion, that they are not part of any circuit split.  That \nbeing said, however, the test that those circuits have \napplied is not meaningfully different from the test \nthat other circuits apply.  Like the Sixth, Seventh, \nEighth, Tenth, and D.C. Circuits, the Second, \n\n29 \n \nFourth, and Ninth Circuits all ask whether a plain-\ntiff has pointed to facts that would suggest the pres-\nence of discrimination. \nRather than linger on the framing of the \u201cback-\nground circumstances\u201d requirement, the Second Cir-\ncuit has focused on the ultimate question that \nMcDonnell Douglas was designed to address.  The \nrelevant question for any discrimination claim, it has \nnoted, is whether the events that give rise to a plain-\ntiff\u2019s complaint occurred \u201cunder circumstances which \ngive rise to an inference of unlawful discrimination.\u201d  \nAulicino v. New York Dep\u2019t of Homeless Servs., 580 \nF.3d 73, 80 (2d Cir. 2009) (quotation omitted).  In the \n\u201cconflict\u201d case that Ames cites, the Second Circuit \nheld that it did not need to decide whether to de-\nmand evidence of \u201cbackground circumstances\u201d be-\ncause the plaintiff\u2019s evidence sufficiently demon-\nstrated those circumstances, even if that require-\nment applied.  Id. at 80 n.5.   \nThe Fourth Circuit has adopted a similar ap-\nproach.  It has held that plaintiffs in all discrimina-\ntion cases must point to \u201csome evidence that race \nwas a determining factor in the employer\u2019s decision.\u201d  \nHolmes v. Bevilacqua, 794 F.2d 142, 147 (4th 1986) \n(en banc).  And while it has \u201cexpressly decline[d] to \ndecide \u2026 whether a higher burden\u201d applies to plain-\ntiffs who bring a \u201creverse\u201d discrimination claim, it \nhas held that the burden that its precedent calls for \nis not meaningfully different from the standard that \nthe D.C. Circuit discussed in Parker.  Lucas v. Dole, \n835 F.2d 532, 533\u201334 & n.9 (4th Cir. 1987) (emphasis \nadded). \nFinally, the Ninth Circuit fits into this category \nas well.  In an unpublished decision, it also chose not \n\n30 \n \nto weigh in on how the first component of the \nMcDonnell Douglas prima facie test should be modi-\nfied when faced with a \u201creverse\u201d discrimination \nclaim.  Zottola v. City of Oakland, 32 F. App\u2019x 307, \n311 (9th Cir. 2002).  The plaintiff\u2019s claim in that case, \nthe court held, failed with or without a \u201cbackground \ncircumstances\u201d requirement.  Id. at 311.  The only \nother Ninth Circuit decision that Ames cites also did \nnot address the Question Presented here.  The court \nin that case asked the same question that all other \ncircuits ask: did the plaintiffs provide evidence that \n\u201cgives rise to an inference of unlawful discrimina-\ntion\u201d?  See Hawn v. Exec. Jet Mgmt., 615 F.3d 1151, \n1156 (9th Cir. 2010) (quotation omitted). \nb. The First and Fifth Circuits belong to the sec-\nond category of circuits that Ames identifies: those \nthat have not discussed the \u201cbackground circum-\nstances\u201d element at all.  Like the circuits that have \nexpressly declined to decide whether or how to adjust \nMcDonnell Douglas\u2019s prima facie elements to account \nfor \u201creverse\u201d discrimination claims, the silence of the \nFirst and Fifth Circuits means that they cannot be \nproperly said to conflict with the other circuits.  And \neven though the First and Fifth Circuits have not \naddressed whether a \u201cbackground circumstances\u201d el-\nement is part of the prima facie test for \u201creverse\u201d dis-\ncrimination claims, the legal standard that they ap-\nply is still consistent with the standard that courts \nthat have adopted such a component apply.   \nThe First Circuit in Williams v. Raytheon Co., 220 \nF.3d 16 (1st Cir. 2000), for example, stated that the \nburden of establishing a prima facie case under \nMcDonnell Douglas is \u201cnot onerous.\u201d  Id. at 19.  To \nthe extent that the First Circuit did not discuss the \n\n31 \n \ncomponents of the prima facie test in greater detail, \nthat is because, after briefly discussing those ele-\nments, it largely \u201cput[] aside\u201d those elements and \u201cas \n[it has] often done,\u201d turned \u201cto whether there is evi-\ndence that, notwithstanding the employer\u2019s stated \nreasons for the termination, the real reason, at least \nin part, was \u2026 discrimination.\u201d  See Fontanez-Nunez \nv. Janssen Ortho, LLC, 447 F.3d 50, 56 (1st Cir. \n2006) (quotation omitted).  That is, it focused on the \nquestion of pretext.  Having done so, it held that the \nplaintiff\u2019s claim failed because his evidence did not \n\u201csupport a reasonable inference that [the employer] \nacted out of a discriminatory purpose.\u201d  Williams, \n220 F.3d at 20. \n The Fifth Circuit\u2019s approach in Byers v. Dallas \nMorning News, Inc., 209 F.3d 419 (5th Cir. 2000) is \nsimilar.  Like the First Circuit in Williams, it also \ndid not discuss a \u201cbackground circumstances\u201d ap-\nproach to the prima facie test like the one that some \ncircuits have used.  See id. 425\u201327.  It asked instead \nwhether the plaintiff had carried his burden of pro-\nducing \u201csufficient evidence indirectly demonstrating \ndiscriminatory intent.\u201d  Id. at 427.  The plaintiff in \nWilliams had not done so, the Fifth Circuit held, be-\ncause the only evidence of discrimination he had of-\nfered was \u201chis subjective belief.\u201d  Id.  The Fifth Cir-\ncuit\u2019s requirement that a plaintiff introduce enough \nindirect evidence to suggest a discriminatory motive \nis not meaningfully different from the \u201cbackground \ncircumstances\u201d requirement that other circuits have \nadopted.  The main difference is the label that those \ncircuits have assigned to that element of the prima \nfacie test. \n\n32 \n \nC. \nDistrict court uncertainty is not a \nreason to grant Ames\u2019s petition for \na writ of certiorari. \nHaving failed to make a compelling case that the \ncircuits are divided in a way that meaningfully af-\nfects the outcome of Title VII cases, Ames turns to \nthe district courts.  But even if she is right that some \ndistrict courts are confused about how to apply \nMcDonnell Douglas\u2019s test to \u201creverse\u201d discrimination \nclaims, the remedy for that confusion is further re-\nview in the circuit courts.  Those courts, not this one, \nare best suited to resolve any district court uncer-\ntainty or disagreement.  See Stephen Shapiro, et al., \nSupreme Court Practice, 505 (10th ed. 2013) (federal \ndistrict court conflicts \u201ccan be eliminated by the \ncourts of appeals\u201d); see also S. Ct. Prac. R. 10 (focus-\ning on United States courts of appeals decisions \nwhen considering whether certiorari is warranted).   \n* \n* \n* \nAt bottom, the circuits\u2019 slight variations in ap-\nproaching \u201creverse\u201d discrimination claims involves \nan almost-never-dispositive difference that largely \nboils down to differing verbal formulations.  And \nthose differences cropped up decades ago.  If this is a \nsplit at all, it is stale and largely irrelevant.    \nIII. \nThe Sixth Circuit faithfully applied this \nCourt\u2019s precedent when it held that Ames \nhad not made out a prima facie case of \ndiscrimination. \nRegardless of whether a circuit split exists, the \nSixth Circuit faithfully applies this Court\u2019s precedent \nwhen reviewing Title VII claims.  It has recognized \nthat \u201cTitle VII, of course, prohibits racial discrimina-\n\n33 \n \ntion against all groups.\u201d  Thistledown Racing, 770 \nF.2d at 67 (citing McDonald, 427 U.S. at 276, 279 \n(1976)).  The \u201cbackground circumstances\u201d element \nthat it applies to \u201creverse\u201d discrimination claims re-\nflects this Court\u2019s own focus on whether a plaintiff\u2019s \nallegations \u201c\u2018if otherwise unexplained, are more like-\nly than not based on the consideration of impermis-\nsible factors.\u2019\u201d  Burdine, 450 U.S. at 254 (quoting \nFurnco, 438 U.S. at 577).  And just like this Court \nhas held that McDonnell Douglas\u2019s prima facie \nstandard \u201cwas \u2018never intended to be rigid, mecha-\nnized, or ritualistic,\u2019\u201d Aikens, 460 U.S. at 715, the \nSixth Circuit has recognized that its \u201cbackground \ncircumstances\u201d requirement is \u201cnot onerous\u201d and \nmay be satisfied \u201cthrough a variety of means,\u201d John-\nson, 502 F. App\u2019x at 536. \nTo the extent that the panel\u2019s decision in this case \ncan be read as inflexibly applying a \u201cbackground cir-\ncumstances\u201d requirement, that is likely because of \nthe way Ames chose to litigate her appeal.  She did \nnot challenge the \u201cbackground circumstances\u201d re-\nquirement in any way and, by arguing that she had \ndemonstrated background circumstances, implicitly \naccepted it.  See, Ames Br., App.R.21 at 17\u201320.  In \ndoing so, she offered two reasons why background \ncircumstances existed: the identity of the deci-\nsionmaker (an argument that the panel held she had \nforfeited, see Pet.App.6a) and her own experiences.  \nSee id.  The fact that the panel focused solely on \nthose elements shows only that it engaged with \nAmes\u2019s arguments and wanted to succinctly dispose \nof her claims.  That the panel did not more thorough-\nly discuss an issue that neither of the parties had \nraised is, at most, a drafting issue that does not cre-\n\n34 \n \nate a circuit split\u2014let alone warrant this Court\u2019s re-\nview. \nThis case shows why all plaintiffs, including those \nwho bring \u201creverse\u201d discrimination claims, must \nmake some threshold showing that suggests discrim-\nination.  And it shows why, even if the circuit split \nthat Ames purports to identify exists, there is no \nmeaningful split about the outcome of this case.  The \nacid test for cert-worthiness is whether a case would \ncome out different in different circuits.  This case \nwould not.  \nAmes\u2019s evidence in this case was this: She was a \nwoman who did not receive a job for which she quali-\nfied and to which she had applied.  Walburn, one of \nthe individuals who was responsible for hiring for \nthat job, was also a woman.  And the person who was \nultimately hired for the job was also a woman\u2014and \nwas qualified for the position.  The woman who was \nhired was gay, however, and Ames was not.   \nAmes did not identify any evidence that suggest-\ned sexual orientation played any role in the hiring \ndecision, however.  She did not point to any evidence \nindicating that the relevant decisionmakers were \ngay.  Nor did she point to any evidence suggesting \nthat the decisionmakers knew the sexual orientation \nof either Ames or of the woman that they ultimately \nhired.  She instead conceded in the district court that \nthe Department\u2019s statement of the facts was correct.  \nSee Opposition to Motion for Summary Judgment, \nR.72, PageID#2488 n.1.  Without such evidence, \nthere is nothing that \u201craises an inference of discrimi-\nnation \u2026 if otherwise unexplained.\u201d  See Burdine, \n450 U.S. at 254 (quotation omitted).  Thus, under \nany formulation of McDonnell Douglas\u2019s prima facie \n\n35 \n \ntest, Ames\u2019s claim would fail.  If the Court were to \nhold otherwise, and if it were to hold that Ames es-\ntablished a prima facie case of discrimination in this \ncase anyway, then McDonnell Douglas\u2019s prima facie \nscreening test will have lost almost all of its mean-\ning.  \nCONCLUSION \nThe Court should deny the petition for a writ of \ncertiorari.  \n \nRespectfully submitted, \n \nDAVE YOST \nAttorney General of Ohio \nMICHAEL J.

          "task_beliefs": "The latest observation was an internal `THINK` action, a metacognitive step to process previous failures and plan the next action. As this observation contains no new external information about the case, my task-level beliefs (\u03b8) remain stable. The primary effect is to confirm and reinforce the current state of my knowledge and, most importantly, the critical nature of the existing information gap.\n\n*   **Case Status (Stable):** The Supreme Court granted certiorari on October 4, 2024. The decision to hear the case, despite the respondent's arguments about procedural \"vehicle problems\" in the Brief in Opposition (BIO), continues to be the strongest signal that the Court intends to rule on the merits of the \"background circumstances\" test. However, the risk of a Dismissal as Improvidently Granted (DIG) remains significant.\n*   **Core Legal Question (Stable):** The central issue is unchanged: Does Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 require a plaintiff from a majority group (in this case, a heterosexual individual alleging sexual orientation discrimination) to show \"background circumstances suggesting that the defendant is the unusual employer who discriminates against the majority\" to establish a prima facie case?\n*   **Petitioner's Merits Arguments (Stable):** My model of the petitioner's arguments remains consistent. They will likely argue for a textualist reading of Title VII, emphasizing that the statute protects \"any individual\" from discrimination, making it unlawful to impose different pleading standards based on a plaintiff's group identity. This argument is expected to draw heavily on the logic of *McDonald v. Santa Fe Trail Transp. Co.* (barring discrimination against white employees) and *Bostock v. Clayton County* (extending Title VII to sexual orientation and gender identity).\n*   **Respondent's Cert-Stage Arguments (Stable):** The respondent's strategy, as revealed in the BIO, is to avoid a merits defense of the \"background circumstances\" test and instead focus on procedural arguments for why this case is a poor vehicle. These arguments are: (1) Forfeiture (Ames didn't challenge the test below), (2) Outcome-Irrelevance (the lower court's judgment would stand on other grounds, like pretext), and (3) Tacit Concession (acknowledging the test's weakness post-*SFFA*).\n*   **Prediction (Stable, High Uncertainty):** My prediction remains bifurcated, with the tension between the two outcomes heightened by the continued lack of new data.\n    *   **Possibility 1: Merits Reversal.** If the Court reaches the merits, a reversal is highly probable. The respondent's cert-stage strategy strongly suggests the \"background circumstances\" test is indefensible before the current Court.\n    *   **Possibility 2: Dismissal as Improvidently Granted (DIG).** The procedural arguments raised by the respondent are substantial. A real possibility exists that after full briefing, the Court will conclude the case is not a clean vehicle to decide the question presented and will DIG it.\n*   **Information Gap (CRITICAL & RECONFIRMED):** The internal `THINK` action explicitly confirms that the **Respondent's Merits Brief** is the single most important piece of missing evidence. The failure of my previous search attempts has elevated its importance. This document is the lynchpin; it will reveal whether the respondent is forced to defend the \"background circumstances\" test (making a merits ruling likely) or if they continue to press the \"vehicle problem\" arguments (making a DIG more likely). My entire predictive model is stalled pending its retrieval.",
          "design_beliefs": "This observation, an explicit metacognitive `THINK` step, is extremely valuable for my design-level beliefs (D). It represents the \"belief update\" phase of the DBOED loop in action, where I internalize lessons from failed experiments to design a better one. It reinforces several heuristics and demonstrates their practical application.\n\n**Foundational & Tactical Heuristics (Stable):**\n*   My core heuristics (#1-15) for legal analysis remain valid and were not directly engaged.\n\n**Meta-Heuristics (Reinforced and Operationalized):**\n*   **18-20 (Stable):** Heuristics regarding anomalous data, document precedence, and retrieval resilience are stable.\n*   **21. The DBOED Loop (Strongly Reinforced):** This `THINK` action is a textbook execution of the DBOED cycle. I experienced an outcome (failed search), updated my beliefs about my search strategy (D), identified the persistent uncertainty (\u03b8), and am now planning a new experiment (a more precise search) designed to resolve that uncertainty. This observation validates the importance of this structured, self-correcting loop.\n*   **22. The Principle of Document Verification and Semantic Drift (Reinforced):** The `THINK` action is a direct result of being burned by semantic drift\u2014requesting a \"Brief for Respondents\" and getting the wrong one. The reflection solidifies the lesson that procedural context (certiorari vs. merits) is as important as the document's title.\n*   **23. The Value of \"Near Miss\" Data (Stable):** This principle remains stable.\n*   **24. The Heuristic of Strategic Recapitulation (Reinforced & Refined):** The `THINK` action explicitly separates the *plan* (find the Respondent's Merits Brief) from the *execution* (the imprecise search query). This reinforces the value of having a sound information-gathering plan while adding a crucial corollary: **a good plan requires precise execution.** The failure was tactical, not strategic.\n*   **25-26 (Stable):** The \"Vehicle Problem\" and \"Pre-Merits Documents\" heuristics remain stable and central to my analysis of this specific case.\n*   **27. The Heuristic of Docket Search Precision (Operationalized):** This is the most significant update. The `THINK` action moves this heuristic from a reactive lesson learned into a proactive, operational principle. My internal reasoning explicitly decided to apply the refined sub-principles from the previous step. The plan to use \"on the merits\" in the next query is a direct application of `Heuristic #27a` (Use Procedurally Specific Titles). This demonstrates the successful integration of a new heuristic into my active reasoning process. The analysis of the failed query (`#27d`) directly led to the plan for the next, better query."

Title VII\u2019s pro-\ntections apply equally to everyone.  They apply with \nthe same force to members of minority and majority \ngroups.  McDonald v. Santa Fe Trail Transp. Co., \n427 U.S. 273, 278\u201379 (1976).  The Petition argues \nthat the circuits use differing approaches for majori-\nty- and minority-group plaintiffs for one subpart of \none step of one approach to evaluating employment-\ndiscrimination claims.  The Question Presented nev-\ner gets off the ground: Ames did not question the Cir-\ncuit\u2019s longstanding approach to the Question Pre-\nsented until this Court and, not only does the Ques-\ntion Presented does not make a difference to the out-\ncome of this case, it rarely makes a difference in any \ncase. \nPetitioner Marlean Ames never challenged the \nSixth Circuit\u2019s application of the so-called \u201cback-\nground circumstances\u201d approach to Title VII discrim-\nination claims for majority-group plaintiffs.  Her only \nargument below was that she had satisfied that re-\nquirement.  Ames should not be able to raise an ar-\ngument here that she never aired in the courts be-\nlow.  Ames\u2019s failure bears directly on this Court\u2019s re-\nview.  The Sixth Circuit has taken a nuanced ap-\nproach to the background circumstances element\u2014\nbut none of that nuance was relevant in light of the \nway that Ames presented her appeal.  Furthermore, \nat least two Sixth Circuit judges have indicated that \nthey view Students for Fair Admissions v. President \n& Fellows of Harvard College, 600 U.S. 181 (2023) as \n\n2 \n \nresetting the table for the Circuit\u2019s Title VII prece-\ndent, and would rule that way if the issue were \nproperly preserved.  See Smyer v. Kroger Ltd. P\u2019ship \nI, No. 22-3692, 2024 WL 1007116, at *8 (6th Cir. \nMar. 8, 2024) (Boggs, J., concurring); id. at *10 \n(Readler, J., concurring) (also noting that Ames did \nnot raise the Harvard decision). \nWhat is more, answering the Question Presented \nwill not change the outcome here.  Ames challenged \ntwo separate employment actions in the courts be-\nlow: the Department of Youth Services\u2019 failure to \npromote her and its decision to demote her and re-\nplace her with another employee.   \nThe Sixth Circuit held that Ames\u2019s demotion \nclaim failed at a later step of the familiar three-step \napproach to evaluating discrimination claims (see \nMcDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792 \n(1973)).  That employment decision, it held, involved \nno discriminatory motive.  Ames\u2019s Question Present-\ned does not challenge that aspect of the Sixth Cir-\ncuit\u2019s decision and she therefore can no longer chal-\nlenge the Sixth Circuit\u2019s conclusion that the demo-\ntion about which Ames complains was not discrimi-\nnatory.   \nAs for her promotion claim, Ames has affirmative-\nly waived any challenge to the requirement that she \nestablish a prima facie case of discrimination more \ngenerally.  See Pet.28 n.3.  And because she failed to \nintroduce any evidence that the decisionmakers who \nmade the employment decision that she challenges \nknew of her majority-group status (in this case her \nsexual orientation), Ames\u2019s promotion claim would \nhave failed at the prima facie stage even if the Sixth \nCircuit had not used the legal framework Ames chal-\n\n3 \n \nlenges.  What is more, Ames\u2019s claim that she was not \npromoted would also have failed at the next step of \nMcDonnell Douglas\u2019s analysis.  The Department had \nlegitimate, nondiscriminatory, reasons for hiring \nsomeone other than Ames, and Ames has not pointed \nto sufficient evidence to create a genuine issue of fact \nabout whether those reasons were pretextual.   \nEven without these vehicle flaws, the Court \nshould decline review.  Any divergence in how the \ncircuits approach the Question Presented is more \nform than substance; regardless of how each circuit \nspecifically describes its approach to the Question \nPresented, each circuit is focused on the same under-\nlying question.  Every circuit discussed in the Peti-\ntion asks, in one way or another, whether a plaintiff \nhas shown that an employer\u2019s actions, \u201c\u2018if otherwise \nunexplained,\u201d are \u201cmore likely than not based on the \nconsideration of impermissible factors.\u2019\u201d  Tex. Dep\u2019t of \nCmty. Affairs v. Burdine, 450 U.S. 248, 254 (1981) \n(quoting Furnco Constr. Corp. v. Waters, 438 U.S. \n567, 577 (1978)).  Put another way, all the circuits \nare ultimately trained on the question of what\u2014if \nanything\u2014gives rise to an inference that the plaintiff \nis the minority or the outsider in the context of the \nspecific employment decision the lawsuit challenges.  \nFinally, any difference between the circuits, whether \nin language or substance, arose decades ago.  Despite \nthe longevity of any substantive difference, the cir-\ncuit\u2019s varying formulations rarely, if ever change liti-\ngation outcomes.   \nSTATEMENT \nMarlean Ames worked for the Ohio Department \nof Youth Services in a variety of roles.  Pet.App3a.  \nShe was working as the Administrator of the De-\n\n4 \n \npartment\u2019s Prison Rape Elimination Act program \nwhen the Department created a new position, the \nBureau Chief of Quality Assurance and Improve-\nment.  Pet.App.18a.  Ames applied for the new posi-\ntion.  Id. \nThe Bureau Chief position was a management \nrole that was intended to supervise and guide the \nother members of the Office of Quality and Im-\nprovement.  Pet.App.19a.  Among the key skills that \nthe Department was looking for in a successful can-\ndidate were management, supervision, and workforce \nplanning.  Id.  Ames was one of three people who ap-\nplied for the Bureau Chief job.  Id.  None of them \nwere hired.  Pet.App.20a.  Because there was no \ntimeline for filling the position, the Department de-\ncided to wait to hire someone until an ideal candidate \ncould be found.  Id.   \nSix months after Ames had interviewed for the \nBureau Chief role, the Department hired Yolanda \nFrierson for the job.  Pet.App.20a.  Julie Walburn, \nthe assistant director of the Department, made the \ndecision to hire Frierson.  See Pet.App.18a, 20a\u201321a.  \nAlthough Frierson did not interview for the Bureau \nChief job, Walburn had worked with Frierson in the \npast.  Pet.App.21a.  Walburn felt that Frierson would \nbe a good fit for the role because, among other things, \nFrierson had significant management experience.  \nId.  Although Frierson and Ames were both women, \nFrierson, unlike Ames, was gay.  Id. \nNot long after Ames interviewed for the Bureau \nChief position, she was removed from her role admin-\nistering the Prison Rape Elimination Act program.  \nPet.App.4a.  When the Governor appointed a new Di-\nrector of the Department, he had stressed to that Di-\n\n5 \n \nrector, Ryan Gies, that addressing sexual victimiza-\ntion within the juvenile corrections system was a \nhigh priority.  See Pet.App.18a, 21a\u201322a.  Gies there-\nfore began restructuring the Department\u2019s programs.  \nPet.App.21a\u201322a.   \nIt was that restructuring that cost Ames her posi-\ntion.  Pet.App.22a.  Gies felt that Ames was difficult \nto work with.  Id.  And Walburn was concerned that \nAmes could not oversee a more proactive approach to \ncomplying with the Prison Rape Elimination Act.  Id.  \nAmes was reassigned to a different role within the \nDepartment, one that she had previously held and \nthat paid less, Pet.App.18a, and Alex Stojsavljevic \nwas selected to oversee the Prison Rape Elimination \nAct program, Pet.App.23a.  Stojsavljevic is a gay \nman.  See id. \nAmes filed a complaint with the Equal Opportuni-\nty Commission and received a right-to-sue letter.  \nPet.App.4a.  Ames then filed a complaint in federal \ndistrict court.  Id.  As is relevant here, Ames\u2019s com-\nplaint alleged that the Department discriminated \nagainst her on the basis of sexual orientation (which \nis a form of sex discrimination) when it hired Fri-\nerson for the Bureau Chief role (call this her \u201cpromo-\ntion claim\u201d) and that it discriminated against her on \nthe basis of both sex and sexual orientation when it \ndemoted her and replaced her with Stojsavljevic (call \nthis her \u201cdemotion claim\u201d).  Pet.App.5a, 6a.  The dis-\ntrict court granted summary judgment in the De-\npartment\u2019s favor on both claims, see Pet.App.33a, \n39a\u201340a, and the Sixth Circuit affirmed, Pet.App.3a. \nAmes\u2019s claim related to the Bureau Chief position \nfailed, the Sixth Circuit held, because Ames could not \nmake \na \nprima \nfacie \ncase \nof \ndiscrimination.  \n\n6 \n \nPet.App.5a\u20136a.  Under Sixth Circuit precedent, a \nmajority-group plaintiff like Ames must identify evi-\ndence that would \u201csupport the suspicion that the de-\nfendant is that unusual employer who discriminates \nagainst the majority.\u201d  Pet.App.5a (quoting Arendale \nv. City of Memphis, 519 F.3d 587, 603 (6th Cir. \n2008)).  Ames, the Sixth Circuit held, had not.  \nPet.App.5a\u20136a.  Ames conceded in the district court \nthat Walburn and Gies, neither of whom are gay, \nwere the ones who were responsible for hiring Fri-\nerson. see Opposition to Motion for Summary Judg-\nment, R.72, PageID#2488 n.1.  Ames attempted to \nwalk back that admission on appeal.  She argued in \nthe Sixth Circuit that she had demonstrated back-\nground circumstances of discrimination because a \ndifferent individual made the decision to hire Fri-\nerson and that individual was gay.  See Pet.App.6a.  \nThe Sixth Circuit held, however, that Ames\u2019s conces-\nsion in the district court meant that she had forfeited \nthat argument for purposes of appeal.  Id.   \nThe Sixth Circuit held that Ames\u2019s demotion \nclaim failed for the same reason, at least to the ex-\ntent that Ames alleged that the Department discrim-\ninated against her on the basis of her sexual orienta-\ntion when it replaced her with Stojsavljevic.  See \nPet.App.6a.  But because Ames had also alleged that \nthe Department discriminated against her on the ba-\nsis of sex when it demoted her and selected a man to \nfill her prior position, the Sixth Circuit considered \nthe Department\u2019s proffered reasons for that employ-\nment action.  Pet.App.6a\u20139a.  It held that Ames \nfailed to carry her burden of showing that the De-\npartment discriminated against her.  Id.  The De-\npartment, the Sixth Circuit held, had legitimate, \nnondiscriminatory, reasons for demoting Ames and \n\n7 \n \nhiring Stojsavljevic and Ames failed to introduce any \nevidence that would suggest that those reasons were \npretextual.  See id. \nJudge Kethledge concurred.  Although he joined \nthe opinion in full, he wrote that he disagreed with \nSixth Circuit precedent to the extent that it required \nAmes to show, as part of her prima facie case of sex-\nual-orientation discrimination, that the Department \n\u201cis the unusual employer that discriminates against \nthe majority.\u201d  Pet.App.9a (quotation omitted). \nAmes has now filed a petition for a writ of certio-\nrari in which she challenges the Sixth Circuit\u2019s prec-\nedent, which includes a \u201cbackground circumstances\u201d \ncomponent for employment-discrimination claims to \nproceed down the McDonnell Douglas path if the \nplaintiff is a member of a majority group.  That prec-\nedent required her to point to something that indi-\ncated that the Department was the unusual employ-\ner that discriminates against the majority.  See Pet.i.  \nBut the Question Presented does not challenge the \nportion of the Sixth Circuit\u2019s decision that held that \nthe Department had legitimate, nondiscriminatory \nreasons for demoting Ames and replacing her with \nStojsavljevic.  See, generally, Pet.   \nREASONS FOR DENYING THE PETITION \nI. \nThis case provides a poor vehicle with \nwhich to address the Question Presented. \nThis case has numerous vehicle problems that \nmake it a poor case in which to consider the Question \nPresented.  Any one of those problems provides a \nreason to deny Ames\u2019s petition for a writ of certiorari. \nThe context for these vehicle flaws includes both \nlegal and factual background. \n\n8 \n \nLegally, these flaws intersect with this Court\u2019s \nfrequently invoked tool for assessing discrimination \nclaims in McDonnell Douglas.  All Title VII plaintiffs, \nregardless of the group to which they belong, bear \nthe \u201cultimate burden of persuading the trier of fact \nthat \nthe \ndefendant \nintentionally \ndiscriminated \nagainst\u201d them.  Burdine, 450 U.S. at 253.  The Court \nin McDonnell Douglas adopted a three-step analysis \nto assist courts in reviewing Title VII claims.  At the \nfirst step, a plaintiff bears the burden of establishing \na prima facie case of discrimination.  411 U.S. at 802.  \nOnce she does so, the employer must offer a legiti-\nmate, nondiscriminatory, reason for its actions.  Id. \nat 802\u201303. The plaintiff then bears the burden of \nshowing that the employer\u2019s reasons were pretextual.  \nId. at 804.  McDonnell Douglas\u2019s test was \u201cnever in-\ntended to be rigid, mechanized, or ritualistic,\u201d how-\never; it was simply intended to be \u201ca sensible, orderly \nway to evaluate the evidence in light of common ex-\nperience as it bears on the critical question of dis-\ncrimination.\u201d  Furnco Constr. Corp. v. Waters, 438 \nU.S. 567, 577 (1978). \nFactually, these flaws intersect with Ames\u2019s two \nclaimed acts of employment discrimination.  Recall \nthat she initially challenged both the Department\u2019s \ndecision to promote a different person and the De-\npartment\u2019s decision to demote her when it picked a \ndifferent person to fill Ames\u2019s former role.  Ames \nchallenged the promotion decision as illegal sexual-\norientation discrimination and challenged the demo-\ntion decision as both illegal sex and sexual-\norientation discrimination.  And while the Sixth Cir-\ncuit affirmed judgment against Ames on her orienta-\ntion theories for failing the prima facie inquiry with \nrespect to both her promotion and demotion claims, it \n\n9 \n \naffirmed \njudgment \nagainst \nher \non \nthe \nsex-\ndiscrimination theory because Ames could not show \nany pretext in the Department\u2019s decision to demote \nher and to select someone to replace her at her for-\nmer position.  See Pet.App.7a\u20138a.  The Sixth Circuit, \nthat is, rejected Ames\u2019s claim that the Department \ndiscriminated against her when it demoted her.   \nIn this Court, Ames\u2019s Question Presented targets \nonly a component of the prima facie showing.  The \nconsequence of that choice is that Ames cannot chal-\nlenge the Department\u2019s decision to demote her be-\ncause she has not challenged the lower court\u2019s hold-\nings that the demotion decision involved no pretext \n(and thus no discrimination).    \nWith that legal and factual setting, the following \nfour vehicle flaws point against granting review. \nA. \nAmes did not challenge the Sixth \nCircuit\u2019s prima facie test below. \nAmes never challenged the Sixth Circuit\u2019s \u201cback-\nground circumstances\u201d element below.  She argued \ninstead that she satisfied that requirement.  While \nAmes\u2019s litigation strategy may not have forfeited her \nQuestion Presented in the strictest sense, it still \nmakes this case a poor vehicle with which to consider \nthat question. \nThe Court has indicated that parties need not al-\nways raise their arguments for the first time in the \ncircuit courts.  It has noted that there is no require-\nment that a \u201cparty demand overruling of a squarely \napplicable, recent circuit precedent, even though that \nprecedent was established in a case to which the par-\nty itself was privy and over the party\u2019s vigorous ob-\njection.\u201d  United States v. Williams, 504 U.S. 36, 44 \n\n10 \n \n(1992); see also United States v. Vonn, 535 U.S. 55, \n58 (2002).   \nEven if Ames was not required to challenge exist-\ning Sixth Circuit precedent, she at least should not \nbe able to benefit from her failure to do so.  But that, \nin effect, is what she seeks to do.  As discussed in \nmore detail below, the Sixth Circuit has taken a nu-\nanced approach to determining whether a majority-\ngroup plaintiff has identified background circum-\nstances that suggest discrimination.  See below at \n23\u201324, 33\u201335.  Among other things, it has held that \nthe \u201c[background circumstances] requirement is not \nonerous, and can be met through a variety of means.\u201d  \nJohnson v. Metro. Gov\u2019t of Nashville & Davidson \nCnty., 502 F. App\u2019x 523, 536 (6th Cir. 2012).  Had \nAmes argued that such a requirement is inconsistent \nwith Title VII, then the Sixth Circuit would have had \nthe opportunity to discuss its precedent in greater \ndetail.  It could have explained, for example, that the \n\u201cbackground circumstances\u201d requirement is not a \nhigher burden, merely a different one.  But because \nAmes did not raise that issue, the panel had no rea-\nson to reject her framing of the background circum-\nstances element of the prima\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n37: 20240531133512454_Ames20Cert20of20Compliance.json (score: 0.313)\nNo. 23-1039 \nIn the Supreme Court of the United States \n___________________________________ \nMARLEAN A.

Title VII\u2019s pro-\ntections apply equally to everyone.  They apply with \nthe same force to members of minority and majority \ngroups.  McDonald v. Santa Fe Trail Transp. Co., \n427 U.S. 273, 278\u201379 (1976).  The Petition argues \nthat the circuits use differing approaches for majori-\nty- and minority-group plaintiffs for one subpart of \none step of one approach to evaluating employment-\ndiscrimination claims.  The Question Presented nev-\ner gets off the ground: Ames did not question the Cir-\ncuit\u2019s longstanding approach to the Question Pre-\nsented until this Court and, not only does the Ques-\ntion Presented does not make a difference to the out-\ncome of this case, it rarely makes a difference in any \ncase. \nPetitioner Marlean Ames never challenged the \nSixth Circuit\u2019s application of the so-called \u201cback-\nground circumstances\u201d approach to Title VII discrim-\nination claims for majority-group plaintiffs.  Her only \nargument below was that she had satisfied that re-\nquirement.  Ames should not be able to raise an ar-\ngument here that she never aired in the courts be-\nlow.  Ames\u2019s failure bears directly on this Court\u2019s re-\nview.  The Sixth Circuit has taken a nuanced ap-\nproach to the background circumstances element\u2014\nbut none of that nuance was relevant in light of the \nway that Ames presented her appeal.  Furthermore, \nat least two Sixth Circuit judges have indicated that \nthey view Students for Fair Admissions v. President \n& Fellows of Harvard College, 600 U.S. 181 (2023) as \n\n2 \n \nresetting the table for the Circuit\u2019s Title VII prece-\ndent, and would rule that way if the issue were \nproperly preserved.  See Smyer v. Kroger Ltd. P\u2019ship \nI, No. 22-3692, 2024 WL 1007116, at *8 (6th Cir. \nMar. 8, 2024) (Boggs, J., concurring); id. at *10 \n(Readler, J., concurring) (also noting that Ames did \nnot raise the Harvard decision). \nWhat is more, answering the Question Presented \nwill not change the outcome here.  Ames challenged \ntwo separate employment actions in the courts be-\nlow: the Department of Youth Services\u2019 failure to \npromote her and its decision to demote her and re-\nplace her with another employee.   \nThe Sixth Circuit held that Ames\u2019s demotion \nclaim failed at a later step of the familiar three-step \napproach to evaluating discrimination claims (see \nMcDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792 \n(1973)).  That employment decision, it held, involved \nno discriminatory motive.  Ames\u2019s Question Present-\ned does not challenge that aspect of the Sixth Cir-\ncuit\u2019s decision and she therefore can no longer chal-\nlenge the Sixth Circuit\u2019s conclusion that the demo-\ntion about which Ames complains was not discrimi-\nnatory.   \nAs for her promotion claim, Ames has affirmative-\nly waived any challenge to the requirement that she \nestablish a prima facie case of discrimination more \ngenerally.  See Pet.28 n.3.  And because she failed to \nintroduce any evidence that the decisionmakers who \nmade the employment decision that she challenges \nknew of her majority-group status (in this case her \nsexual orientation), Ames\u2019s promotion claim would \nhave failed at the prima facie stage even if the Sixth \nCircuit had not used the legal framework Ames chal-\n\n3 \n \nlenges.  What is more, Ames\u2019s claim that she was not \npromoted would also have failed at the next step of \nMcDonnell Douglas\u2019s analysis.  The Department had \nlegitimate, nondiscriminatory, reasons for hiring \nsomeone other than Ames, and Ames has not pointed \nto sufficient evidence to create a genuine issue of fact \nabout whether those reasons were pretextual.   \nEven without these vehicle flaws, the Court \nshould decline review.  Any divergence in how the \ncircuits approach the Question Presented is more \nform than substance; regardless of how each circuit \nspecifically describes its approach to the Question \nPresented, each circuit is focused on the same under-\nlying question.  Every circuit discussed in the Peti-\ntion asks, in one way or another, whether a plaintiff \nhas shown that an employer\u2019s actions, \u201c\u2018if otherwise \nunexplained,\u201d are \u201cmore likely than not based on the \nconsideration of impermissible factors.\u2019\u201d  Tex. Dep\u2019t of \nCmty. Affairs v. Burdine, 450 U.S. 248, 254 (1981) \n(quoting Furnco Constr. Corp. v. Waters, 438 U.S. \n567, 577 (1978)).  Put another way, all the circuits \nare ultimately trained on the question of what\u2014if \nanything\u2014gives rise to an inference that the plaintiff \nis the minority or the outsider in the context of the \nspecific employment decision the lawsuit challenges.  \nFinally, any difference between the circuits, whether \nin language or substance, arose decades ago.  Despite \nthe longevity of any substantive difference, the cir-\ncuit\u2019s varying formulations rarely, if ever change liti-\ngation outcomes.   \nSTATEMENT \nMarlean Ames worked for the Ohio Department \nof Youth Services in a variety of roles.  Pet.App3a.  \nShe was working as the Administrator of the De-\n\n4 \n \npartment\u2019s Prison Rape Elimination Act program \nwhen the Department created a new position, the \nBureau Chief of Quality Assurance and Improve-\nment.  Pet.App.18a.  Ames applied for the new posi-\ntion.  Id. \nThe Bureau Chief position was a management \nrole that was intended to supervise and guide the \nother members of the Office of Quality and Im-\nprovement.  Pet.App.19a.  Among the key skills that \nthe Department was looking for in a successful can-\ndidate were management, supervision, and workforce \nplanning.  Id.  Ames was one of three people who ap-\nplied for the Bureau Chief job.  Id.  None of them \nwere hired.  Pet.App.20a.  Because there was no \ntimeline for filling the position, the Department de-\ncided to wait to hire someone until an ideal candidate \ncould be found.  Id.   \nSix months after Ames had interviewed for the \nBureau Chief role, the Department hired Yolanda \nFrierson for the job.  Pet.App.20a.  Julie Walburn, \nthe assistant director of the Department, made the \ndecision to hire Frierson.  See Pet.App.18a, 20a\u201321a.  \nAlthough Frierson did not interview for the Bureau \nChief job, Walburn had worked with Frierson in the \npast.  Pet.App.21a.  Walburn felt that Frierson would \nbe a good fit for the role because, among other things, \nFrierson had significant management experience.  \nId.  Although Frierson and Ames were both women, \nFrierson, unlike Ames, was gay.  Id. \nNot long after Ames interviewed for the Bureau \nChief position, she was removed from her role admin-\nistering the Prison Rape Elimination Act program.  \nPet.App.4a.  When the Governor appointed a new Di-\nrector of the Department, he had stressed to that Di-\n\n5 \n \nrector, Ryan Gies, that addressing sexual victimiza-\ntion within the juvenile corrections system was a \nhigh priority.  See Pet.App.18a, 21a\u201322a.  Gies there-\nfore began restructuring the Department\u2019s programs.  \nPet.App.21a\u201322a.   \nIt was that restructuring that cost Ames her posi-\ntion.  Pet.App.22a.  Gies felt that Ames was difficult \nto work with.  Id.  And Walburn was concerned that \nAmes could not oversee a more proactive approach to \ncomplying with the Prison Rape Elimination Act.  Id.  \nAmes was reassigned to a different role within the \nDepartment, one that she had previously held and \nthat paid less, Pet.App.18a, and Alex Stojsavljevic \nwas selected to oversee the Prison Rape Elimination \nAct program, Pet.App.23a.  Stojsavljevic is a gay \nman.  See id. \nAmes filed a complaint with the Equal Opportuni-\nty Commission and received a right-to-sue letter.  \nPet.App.4a.  Ames then filed a complaint in federal \ndistrict court.  Id.  As is relevant here, Ames\u2019s com-\nplaint alleged that the Department discriminated \nagainst her on the basis of sexual orientation (which \nis a form of sex discrimination) when it hired Fri-\nerson for the Bureau Chief role (call this her \u201cpromo-\ntion claim\u201d) and that it discriminated against her on \nthe basis of both sex and sexual orientation when it \ndemoted her and replaced her with Stojsavljevic (call \nthis her \u201cdemotion claim\u201d).  Pet.App.5a, 6a.  The dis-\ntrict court granted summary judgment in the De-\npartment\u2019s favor on both claims, see Pet.App.33a, \n39a\u201340a, and the Sixth Circuit affirmed, Pet.App.3a. \nAmes\u2019s claim related to the Bureau Chief position \nfailed, the Sixth Circuit held, because Ames could not \nmake \na \nprima \nfacie \ncase \nof \ndiscrimination.  \n\n6 \n \nPet.App.5a\u20136a.  Under Sixth Circuit precedent, a \nmajority-group plaintiff like Ames must identify evi-\ndence that would \u201csupport the suspicion that the de-\nfendant is that unusual employer who discriminates \nagainst the majority.\u201d  Pet.App.5a (quoting Arendale \nv. City of Memphis, 519 F.3d 587, 603 (6th Cir. \n2008)).  Ames, the Sixth Circuit held, had not.  \nPet.App.5a\u20136a.  Ames conceded in the district court \nthat Walburn and Gies, neither of whom are gay, \nwere the ones who were responsible for hiring Fri-\nerson. see Opposition to Motion for Summary Judg-\nment, R.72, PageID#2488 n.1.  Ames attempted to \nwalk back that admission on appeal.  She argued in \nthe Sixth Circuit that she had demonstrated back-\nground circumstances of discrimination because a \ndifferent individual made the decision to hire Fri-\nerson and that individual was gay.  See Pet.App.6a.  \nThe Sixth Circuit held, however, that Ames\u2019s conces-\nsion in the district court meant that she had forfeited \nthat argument for purposes of appeal.  Id.   \nThe Sixth Circuit held that Ames\u2019s demotion \nclaim failed for the same reason, at least to the ex-\ntent that Ames alleged that the Department discrim-\ninated against her on the basis of her sexual orienta-\ntion when it replaced her with Stojsavljevic.  See \nPet.App.6a.  But because Ames had also alleged that \nthe Department discriminated against her on the ba-\nsis of sex when it demoted her and selected a man to \nfill her prior position, the Sixth Circuit considered \nthe Department\u2019s proffered reasons for that employ-\nment action.  Pet.App.6a\u20139a.  It held that Ames \nfailed to carry her burden of showing that the De-\npartment discriminated against her.  Id.  The De-\npartment, the Sixth Circuit held, had legitimate, \nnondiscriminatory, reasons for demoting Ames and \n\n7 \n \nhiring Stojsavljevic and Ames failed to introduce any \nevidence that would suggest that those reasons were \npretextual.  See id. \nJudge Kethledge concurred.  Although he joined \nthe opinion in full, he wrote that he disagreed with \nSixth Circuit precedent to the extent that it required \nAmes to show, as part of her prima facie case of sex-\nual-orientation discrimination, that the Department \n\u201cis the unusual employer that discriminates against \nthe majority.\u201d  Pet.App.9a (quotation omitted). \nAmes has now filed a petition for a writ of certio-\nrari in which she challenges the Sixth Circuit\u2019s prec-\nedent, which includes a \u201cbackground circumstances\u201d \ncomponent for employment-discrimination claims to \nproceed down the McDonnell Douglas path if the \nplaintiff is a member of a majority group.  That prec-\nedent required her to point to something that indi-\ncated that the Department was the unusual employ-\ner that discriminates against the majority.  See Pet.i.  \nBut the Question Presented does not challenge the \nportion of the Sixth Circuit\u2019s decision that held that \nthe Department had legitimate, nondiscriminatory \nreasons for demoting Ames and replacing her with \nStojsavljevic.  See, generally, Pet.   \nREASONS FOR DENYING THE PETITION \nI. \nThis case provides a poor vehicle with \nwhich to address the Question Presented. \nThis case has numerous vehicle problems that \nmake it a poor case in which to consider the Question \nPresented.  Any one of those problems provides a \nreason to deny Ames\u2019s petition for a writ of certiorari. \nThe context for these vehicle flaws includes both \nlegal and factual background. \n\n8 \n \nLegally, these flaws intersect with this Court\u2019s \nfrequently invoked tool for assessing discrimination \nclaims in McDonnell Douglas.  All Title VII plaintiffs, \nregardless of the group to which they belong, bear \nthe \u201cultimate burden of persuading the trier of fact \nthat \nthe \ndefendant \nintentionally \ndiscriminated \nagainst\u201d them.  Burdine, 450 U.S. at 253.  The Court \nin McDonnell Douglas adopted a three-step analysis \nto assist courts in reviewing Title VII claims.  At the \nfirst step, a plaintiff bears the burden of establishing \na prima facie case of discrimination.  411 U.S. at 802.  \nOnce she does so, the employer must offer a legiti-\nmate, nondiscriminatory, reason for its actions.  Id. \nat 802\u201303. The plaintiff then bears the burden of \nshowing that the employer\u2019s reasons were pretextual.  \nId. at 804.  McDonnell Douglas\u2019s test was \u201cnever in-\ntended to be rigid, mechanized, or ritualistic,\u201d how-\never; it was simply intended to be \u201ca sensible, orderly \nway to evaluate the evidence in light of common ex-\nperience as it bears on the critical question of dis-\ncrimination.\u201d  Furnco Constr. Corp. v. Waters, 438 \nU.S. 567, 577 (1978). \nFactually, these flaws intersect with Ames\u2019s two \nclaimed acts of employment discrimination.  Recall \nthat she initially challenged both the Department\u2019s \ndecision to promote a different person and the De-\npartment\u2019s decision to demote her when it picked a \ndifferent person to fill Ames\u2019s former role.  Ames \nchallenged the promotion decision as illegal sexual-\norientation discrimination and challenged the demo-\ntion decision as both illegal sex and sexual-\norientation discrimination.  And while the Sixth Cir-\ncuit affirmed judgment against Ames on her orienta-\ntion theories for failing the prima facie inquiry with \nrespect to both her promotion and demotion claims, it \n\n9 \n \naffirmed \njudgment \nagainst \nher \non \nthe \nsex-\ndiscrimination theory because Ames could not show \nany pretext in the Department\u2019s decision to demote \nher and to select someone to replace her at her for-\nmer position.  See Pet.App.7a\u20138a.  The Sixth Circuit, \nthat is, rejected Ames\u2019s claim that the Department \ndiscriminated against her when it demoted her.   \nIn this Court, Ames\u2019s Question Presented targets \nonly a component of the prima facie showing.  The \nconsequence of that choice is that Ames cannot chal-\nlenge the Department\u2019s decision to demote her be-\ncause she has not challenged the lower court\u2019s hold-\nings that the demotion decision involved no pretext \n(and thus no discrimination).    \nWith that legal and factual setting, the following \nfour vehicle flaws point against granting review. \nA. \nAmes did not challenge the Sixth \nCircuit\u2019s prima facie test below. \nAmes never challenged the Sixth Circuit\u2019s \u201cback-\nground circumstances\u201d element below.  She argued \ninstead that she satisfied that requirement.  While \nAmes\u2019s litigation strategy may not have forfeited her \nQuestion Presented in the strictest sense, it still \nmakes this case a poor vehicle with which to consider \nthat question. \nThe Court has indicated that parties need not al-\nways raise their arguments for the first time in the \ncircuit courts.  It has noted that there is no require-\nment that a \u201cparty demand overruling of a squarely \napplicable, recent circuit precedent, even though that \nprecedent was established in a case to which the par-\nty itself was privy and over the party\u2019s vigorous ob-\njection.\u201d  United States v. Williams, 504 U.S. 36, 44 \n\n10 \n \n(1992); see also United States v. Vonn, 535 U.S. 55, \n58 (2002).   \nEven if Ames was not required to challenge exist-\ning Sixth Circuit precedent, she at least should not \nbe able to benefit from her failure to do so.  But that, \nin effect, is what she seeks to do.  As discussed in \nmore detail below, the Sixth Circuit has taken a nu-\nanced approach to determining whether a majority-\ngroup plaintiff has identified background circum-\nstances that suggest discrimination.  See below at \n23\u201324, 33\u201335.  Among other things, it has held that \nthe \u201c[background circumstances] requirement is not \nonerous, and can be met through a variety of means.\u201d  \nJohnson v. Metro. Gov\u2019t of Nashville & Davidson \nCnty., 502 F. App\u2019x 523, 536 (6th Cir. 2012).  Had \nAmes argued that such a requirement is inconsistent \nwith Title VII, then the Sixth Circuit would have had \nthe opportunity to discuss its precedent in greater \ndetail.  It could have explained, for example, that the \n\u201cbackground circumstances\u201d requirement is not a \nhigher burden, merely a different one.  But because \nAmes did not raise that issue, the panel had no rea-\nson to reject her framing of the background circum-\nstances element of the prima facie test.  Put another \nway, one of the reasons that Ames is now able to crit-\nicize the decision below as overly stringent and in-\nflexible is because she herself framed it that way.  \nAnd while that is not waiver or forfeiture formally, \nthe fact that Ames \u201cdid not raise or brief\u201d the ques-\ntion presented \u201cbelow\u201d is a reason to deny certiorari.  \nHoggard v. Rhodes, 141 S. Ct. 2421, 2422 (2021) \n(Thomas, J., respecting the denial of certiorari). \n\n11 \n \nB. \nAnswering the Question Presented \nin Ames\u2019s favor would not change \nthe outcome in this case because \nAmes cannot satisfy a separate \ncomponent of the prima facie \nshowing. \nAmes has affirmatively waived any challenge to \nthe requirement that she establish a prima facie case \nof discrimination.  Pet.28 n.3.  Her only challenge is \nto how the Sixth Circuit applied one component of \nthat rubric in this case.  Ames\u2019s Question Presented \nasks whether, to establish a prima facie case of dis-\ncrimination under Title VII, a majority-group plain-\ntiff must introduce evidence of \u201cbackground circum-\nstances\u201d that suggest discrimination.  See Pet.i.  But \nthe answer to that question will not affect the out-\ncome of this case.  Even if the answer is \u201cno\u201d Ames \nstill could not make a prima facie case of sex discrim-\nination.  And that is a prime reason to deny certiora-\nri.  The Court should \u201cnot ... take up\u201d a question pre-\nsented if the claims underlying that question are \u201cin-\ndependently subject to\u201d defenses that would yield the \nsame result regardless of how the Court answers the \nquestion.  Blankenship v. NBCUniversal, LLC, 144 S. \nCt. 5, 6 (2023) (Thomas, J., concurring in the denial \nof certiorari) \nThere appears to be universal agreement that an \n\u201cemployer cannot intentionally discriminate on the \nbasis of a characteristic of which the employer has no \nknowledge.\u201d  Bostock v. Clayton Cty., 590 U.S. 644, \n691 (2020) (Alito, J., dissenting).  As far as the De-\npartment is aware, every circuit that has considered \nthe question has held that in \u201ccases involving per-\nsonal attributes not obvious to the employer,\u201d a \n\n12 \n \n\u201cplaintiff cannot make out a prima facie case of dis-\ncrimination unless he or she proves that the employ-\ner knew about the plaintiff\u2019s particular personal \ncharacteristic.\u201d  Geraci v. Moody-Tottrup, Int\u2019l, 82 \nF.3d 578, 581 (3d Cir. 1996); Hunter v. UPS, 697 \nF.3d 697, 703\u201304 (8th Cir. 2012); Robinson v. Adams, \n847 F.2d 1315, 1316 (9th Cir. 1987); Lubetsky v. Ap-\nplied Card Sys., 296 F.3d 1301, 1305\u201306 (11th Cir. \n2002); cf. also Raytheon Co. v. Hernandez, 540 U.S. \n44, 54 n.7 (2003) (\u201cIf [an employer] were truly una-\nware that \u2026 a disability existed, it would be impos-\nsible for her hiring decision to have been based, even \nin part, on [the employee\u2019s] disability.\u201d); Landefel v. \nMarion Gen. Hosp., Inc., 994 F.2d 1178, 1181\u201382 (6th \nCir. 1993) (same).  The reverse is also true.  An em-\nployer cannot discriminate in favor of a different em-\nployee if the employer has no knowledge of the fa-\nvored employee\u2019s personal characteristics.  See, e.g., \nPetrikonis v. Wilkes-Barre Hosp. Co., LLC, 582 F. \nApp\u2019x 126, 130 (3d Cir. 2014); Morrow v. Wal\u2013Mart \nStores, Inc., 152 F.3d 559, 563 (7th Cir.1998). \nAmes, however, introduced no evidence that \nwould create a genuine issue of material fact about \nwhether the relevant decisionmakers were aware of \nher sexual orientation, or of the orientation of Fri-\nerson, the person who was ultimately hired for the \njob to which Ames had applied.  The only evidence on \nthat point indicated just the opposite.  The only evi-\ndence related to Walburn\u2019s knowledge with respect to \neither woman showed that she was unaware of Fri-\nerson\u2019s sexual orientation (and was silent with re-\nspect to Ames).  See Motion for Summary Judgment, \nR.71, PageID#2375 (citing Walburn Depo. R.60, \nPageID#668).  And the only evidence related to oth-\ners\u2019 knowledge of Ames\u2019s sexual orientation showed \n\n13 \n \nthat her direct supervisor did not know whether \nAmes was gay or straight.  See id. at 2367 (citing \nTrim Depo., R.64, PageID#1511).  Ames\u2019s failure to \nintroduce any evidence on this point means that no \nmatter how the Court answers the Question Present-\ned her discrimination claim would still fail at the \nprima facia stage.   \nTo be sure, the Sixth Circuit noted that, if not for \nthe background circumstances element, then Ames\u2019s \nprima facie case would have been \u201ceasy to make.\u201d  \nSee Pet.App.5a.  It is clear from context, however, \nthat the Sixth Circuit was referring only to the ele-\nments of a prima facie case discussed in McDonnell \nDouglas.  See id.  Knowledge of an employee\u2019s per-\nsonal characteristics is an additional, threshold, re-\nquirement of a prima facie case, however, and one \nthat the Sixth Circuit did not discuss.  See id.; \nGeraci, 82 F.3d at 581 (noting that McDonnell Doug-\nlas \u201cquite properly makes no reference to the em-\nployer\u2019s knowledge of membership in a protected \nclass\u201d because some protected traits will be known to \nmanagement merely by seeing the employee).     \nC. \nEven if Ames could establish a \nprima facie case of discrimination, \nthe outcome of this case still would \nnot change. \nA favorable answer to the Question Presented \nwould not change the result here for a second, inde-\npendent reason\u2014Ames\u2019s claim fails at the later stag-\nes of McDonnell Douglas.  Even if Ames could make \na prima facie case of discrimination, her promotion \nclaim would fail at McDonnell Douglas\u2019s second and \nthird stages.   \n\n14 \n \nThe Department had nondiscriminatory reasons \nfor its hiring decision and Ames cannot show that \nthose reasons were pretextual.  True, the concur-\nrence suggested otherwise below, Pet.App.10a, and \nAmes now makes a similar argument in her petition, \nsee Pet.32.  But they are both off base.  In response to \nthe Department\u2019s motion for summary judgment, \nAmes failed to point to any evidence that created a \ngenuine issue of material fact about whether the De-\npartment\u2019s decision to hire Frierson (instead of \nAmes) was pretextual.  Indeed, Ames did the oppo-\nsite.  She accepted the Department\u2019s recitation of the \nrelevant facts in its summary judgment motion as \ncorrect (with the exception of two minor issues that \nare not relevant here).  See Opposition to Motion for \nSummary Judgment, R.72, PageID#2488 n.1.   \nTo the extent that the concurrence below suggest-\ned that Ames\u2019s case faltered only at the prima facie \nshowing\u2019s step one, it was confused about the facts \nand evidence presented at summary judgment.  The \nconcurrence identified two factors that, it believed, \nprovided strong evidence of pretext: that the De-\npartment twice promoted a gay employee in a \u201cman-\nner adverse to Ames\u201d and that Frierson lacked the \nminimum qualifications for the job for which she was \nhired.  It was wrong on both counts. \nThe first factor\u2014which involved replacing Ames \nas the administrator of the Prison Rape Elimination \nAct program\u2014was irrelevant.  The Sixth Circuit held \nthat the Department had legitimate, nondiscrimina-\ntory, reasons for hiring Stojsavljevic, the other gay \nindividual that the concurrence referenced, for that \nposition, and Ames has not challenged that portion of \nthe Sixth Circuit\u2019s decision through her Question \n\n15 \n \nPresented.  Because it is now settled that the De-\npartment did not discriminate against Ames when it \nhired Stojsavljevic, that hiring decision cannot serve \nas evidence that the Department\u2019s other actions were \npretextual.  See Pet.12 n.2 (waiving any challenge to \nthe Sixth Circuit\u2019s sex discrimination ruling).   \nAs for the concurrence\u2019s second factor, it misread \nthe record when it stated that Frierson \u201clacked the \nminimum qualifications for the job\u201d for which she \nwas hired.  See Pet.App.10a.  The undisputed evi-\ndence showed that Frierson was qualified.  The job \nposting listed alternative qualifications: an applicant \nwas required to have either a college degree or rele-\nvant work experience.  Motion for Summary Judg-\nment, East Decl., R.71-4, PageID#2419.  And while \nFrierson did not have a degree, she did have the ex-\nperience.  Motion for Summary Judgment, East \nDecl., R.71-5, PageID#2460\u201368.  It was that experi-\nence, in fact, that led the Department to hire her.  \nWalburn Depo., R.60, PageID#635\u201337, 639.  Ames \nmay have argued in the Sixth Circuit that Frierson \nwas not qualified, but she did not introduce any evi-\ndence that created a genuine issue of material fact \nabout Frierson\u2019s qualifications.  Cf. Ames Opposition \nto Summary Judgment, R.72, PageID#2488 (conced-\ning that \u201c[t]he Statement of Facts included in the De-\nfendant\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment is largely \ncorrect\u201d).  Ames\u2019s argument was different in the dis-\ntrict court.  Ames never argued in the district court \nthat Frierson was unqualified.  See Opposition to \nMotion for Summary Judgment, R.72, PageID#2495\u2013\n96.  She argued only that she was more qualified \nthan Frierson was.  Id.  \n\n16 \n \nBecause the Sixth Circuit would likely \u201chave \nreached the same conclusion\u201d that the Department \nshould prevail on summary judgment even if it \nagreed with Ames, certiorari is unwarranted.  See, \ne.g., Hittson v. Chatman, 576 U.S. 1028 (2015) (Gins-\nburg, J., concurring in the denial of certiorari). \nD. \nAmes fails to distinguish between \nthe portion of the Sixth Circuit\u2019s \ndecision that she has challenged \nand the portion that she has not. \nThe Sixth Circuit below considered two separate \ndiscrimination claims and rejected them both.  It \nheld that Ames had failed to make a prima facie case \nof discrimination with respect to her promotion \nclaim.  It also held that Ames had failed to show that \nthe Department\u2019s decision to demote and replace her \nwas discriminatory.  Ames\u2019s demotion claim rested \non two theories of discrimination: sex and sexual ori-\nentation.  But although the Sixth Circuit held that \nAmes had established a prima facie case of discrimi-\nnation only with respect to her sex-discrimination \ntheory, that does not matter; the same nondiscrimi-\nnatory reasons were sufficient to resolve Ames\u2019s sex \nand sexual orientation theories.  Title VII claims \nchallenge employment actions.  See 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a72000e-2(a).  And, generally, the \u201csame legitimate, \nnondiscriminatory reasons that [an employer] ad-\nvance[d] against a finding of \u2026 discrimination apply \nequally to\u201d all similar claims of discrimination aris-\ning from the same event, even if the protected class \nthat provides the basis for the claim differs.  Cf. Hrd-\nlicka v. GM LLC, 63 F.4th 555, 575 (6th Cir. 2023). \nAmes has not challenged the portion of the Sixth \nCircuit\u2019s decision that held that the Department had \n\n17 \n \nnondiscriminatory reasons for demoting her.  The \nQuestion Presented therefore involves only Ames\u2019s \nclaim that the Department discriminated against her \nwhen it promoted Frierson instead of her.  See Pet.i.  \nIn other words, it involves only her promotion claim, \nnot her demotion claim.   \nAmes confuses the Question Presented in this \ncase by suggesting otherwise.  Ames writes that this \ncase involves a \u201cdemotion decision.\u201d  See Pet.32.  Not \nso.  The demotion decision she references involves \nthe demotion claim that she has not challenged \nthrough her Question Presented.  Ames\u2019s failure to \nproperly distinguish between the claim that is before \nthe court, and the one that is not, provides just one \nmore reason why this case provides a poor vehicle to \naddress the Question Presented.  \u201c[A]t the very least\u201d \nAmes\u2019s litigation strategy \u201cwould complicate [the \nCourt\u2019s] review.\u201d  Gordon Coll. v. DeWeese-Boyd, 142 \nS. Ct. 952 (2022) (Alito, J., respecting the denial of \ncertiorari).  And that is reason enough to deny certio-\nrari. \nII. \nThere is no meaningful circuit split; the \ndifferences between the circuits are \nlargely differences in language not law. \nThe Court should deny certiorari even if this \ncase\u2019s vehicle problems did not otherwise render it \nnon-cert worthy.  Ames claims to spy a circuit split \nwith respect to the relevant prima facie test for dis-\ncrimination claims brought by members of a majority \ngroup.  But any differences between the circuits are \nmore differences of terminology than consequential \nlegal substance.   Regardless of the long-standing dif-\nference in language that some circuits use, the out-\ncome is largely the same. \n\n18 \n \nA. \nThis Court\u2019s precedent instructs \nthat the McDonnell Douglas test is \na flexible one.  \nThis Court\u2019s decision in McDonnell Douglas pro-\nvides the foundation for a large majority of Title VII \nclaims.  Ames does not dispute that every circuit, \neven those that she alleges conflict with one another, \napplies that decision to at least some degree.  To the \nextent that Ames alleges that a split exists, it is a \nsplit over how the various circuits apply McDonnell \nDouglas.  Before addressing Ames\u2019s claimed split, \nsome background about that decision, and the \nCourt\u2019s precedent interpreting and applying it, is \ntherefore needed. \nBecause direct evidence of discrimination \u201c\u2018essen-\ntially requires an admission by the employer,\u2019 such \nevidence \u2018is rare.\u2019\u201d  Argyropoulos v. City of Alton, 539 \nF.3d 724, 733 (7th Cir. 2008) (citations omitted). \nThat is one reason why the Court adopted what is \nnow known as the McDonnell Douglas test.  Under \nthat test, a plaintiff may rely on indirect evidence to \nprove a discrimination claim.  The first step of \nMcDonnell Douglas\u2019s test requires a plaintiff to es-\ntablish a prima facie case of discrimination by show-\ning four things: \u201c(i) that he belongs to a racial minor-\nity; (ii) that he applied and was qualified for a job for \nwhich the employer was seeking applicants; (iii) that, \ndespite his qualifications, he was rejected; and (iv) \nthat, after his rejection, the position remained open \nand the employer continued to seek applicants from \npersons of complainant\u2019s qualifications.\u201d  McDonnell \nDouglas, 411 U.S. at 802.  But because \u201cfacts neces-\nsarily will vary in Title VII cases,\u201d the Court in \nMcDonnell Douglas acknowledged that the four-part \n\n19 \n \ntest it laid out will not apply \u201cin every respect to dif-\nfering factual situations.\u201d  Id. at 802 n.13.  Indeed, \npart one \u201cof this sample pattern of proof was set out \nonly to demonstrate how the racial character of the \ndiscrimination could be established in the most \ncommon sort of case, and not as an indication of any \nsubstantive limitation of Title VII\u2019s prohibition of ra-\ncial discrimination.\u201d  McDonald, 427 U.S. at 279 n.6 \n(1976) \nThe Court\u2019s subsequent decisions reaffirmed that \nMcDonnell Douglas was \u201c\u2018never intended to be rigid, \nmechanized, or ritualistic. Rather, it is merely a sen-\nsible, orderly way to evaluate the evidence in light of \ncommon experience as it bears on the critical ques-\ntion of discrimination.\u2019\u201d  USPS Bd. of Governors v. \nAikens, 460 U.S. 711, 715 (1983) (quoting Furnco, \n438 U.S. at 577).  The relevant question in Title VII \ncases is \u201calways whether the employer is treating \n\u2018some people less favorably than others because of \ntheir race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.\u2019\u201d \nFurnco, 438 U.S. at 577 (quoting Int\u2019l Brotherhood of \nTeamsters v. United States, 431 U.S. 324, 335 n.15 \n(1977)).  A plaintiff makes out a prima facie case of \ndiscrimination under McDonnell Douglas and Title \nVII by \u201cshowing actions taken by the employer from \nwhich one can infer, if such actions remain unex-\nplained, that it is more likely than not that such ac-\ntions were \u2018based on a discriminatory criterion illegal \nunder the Act.\u2019\u201d  Furnco, 438 U.S. at 576 (quoting \nTeamsters, 431 U.S. at 358); see also Young v. UPS, \n575 U.S. 206, 228 (2015) (same).  McDonnell Douglas \nis not an end in itself; it exists simply to eliminate \n\u201cthe most common nondiscriminatory reasons for the \nplaintiff\u2019s rejection.\u201d  Burdine, 450 U.S. at 253\u201354.   \n\n20 \n \nConsistent with the Court\u2019s precedent, lower \ncourts have modified McDonnell Douglas\u2019s test as \nnecessary to account for a specific plaintiff\u2019s discrim-\nination claims.  They have, for example, adopted \nmodified versions of the McDonnell Douglas test to \ngovern discriminatory promotion claims, Bundy v. \nJackson, 641 F.2d 934, 951 (D.C. Cir. 1981), retalia-\ntion claims, Laster v. City of Kalamazoo, 746 F.3d \n714, 730 (6th Cir. 2014), and discriminatory disci-\npline claims, Reives v. Illinois State Police, 29 F.4th \n887, 891\u201392 (7th Cir. 2022); see also Murray v. This-\ntledown Racing Club, Inc., 770 F.2d 63, 67 (6th Cir. \n1985) (noting that \u201ccourts have modified the McDon-\nnell Douglas standard to address disparate treat-\nment cases involving all discrimination prohibited by \nthe Act in promotion, firing, compensation or other \nconditions of employment\u201d). \nOne other modification involves claims by majori-\nty-group plaintiffs;  what some call \u201creverse\u201d discrim-\nination.  It is impossible to apply McDonnell Douglas \nliterally to such cases. The first prong of the McDon-\nnell Douglas prima facie test asks, after all, whether \nthe plaintiff was a \u201cracial minority.\u201d  McDonnell \nDouglas, 411 U.S. at 802; see also Parker v. Balti-\nmore & Ohio R. Co., 652 F.2d 1012, 1017 (D.C. Cir. \n1981).  Courts must therefore always adapt McDon-\nnell Douglas to at least some degree when they are \nconfronted with a \u201creverse\u201d discrimination claim.  \nThe Sixth Circuit, like many courts around the coun-\ntry, has adopted a prima facie test to govern discrim-\nination claims filed by members of a majority group \nwho allege that they were discriminated against in \nfavor of a minority group.  Those courts require a \nplaintiff who alleges discrimination based on the \nplaintiff\u2019s membership in a majority group to point to \n\n21 \n \nbackground circumstances that provide some evi-\ndence to \u201csupport the suspicion that the defendant is \nthat unusual employer who discriminates against the \nmajority.\u201d  Thistledown Racing, 770 F.2d at 67 (quot-\ning Parker, 652 F.2d at 1017).  This requirement is \noften shorthanded as simply a \u201cbackground circum-\nstances\u201d requirement.  But regardless of its label, a \nmajority plaintiff\u2019s burden, like the burden minority \nplaintiffs bear, is \u201cnot onerous.\u201d  Compare Johnson, \n502 F. App\u2019x at 536 with Burdine, 450 U.S. at 253. \nB. \nThere is no meaningful \ndisagreement between the circuits \nabout the ultimate legal standard \nthat McDonnell Douglas \nestablished. \nAmes argues that there is a split over how Courts \nhave applied McDonnell Douglas to \u201creverse\u201d dis-\ncrimination claims.  She groups the circuits into \nthree categories 1) circuits that have adopted a \n\u201cbackground circumstances\u201d requirement, 2) circuits \nthat she claims do not apply a \u201cbackground circum-\nstances\u201d requirement, and 3) circuits that have ex-\nplicitly rejected such a requirement.  See Pet.14\u201325  \nA close examination of the cases she cites reveals, \nhowever, that even though some circuits have used \ndifferent language to describe their approach, they \nultimately all focus on the same basic legal question: \nare there facts from which one can \u201cinfer, if such ac-\ntions remain unexplained, that it is more likely than \nnot that [an employer\u2019s] actions were based on a dis-\ncriminatory criterion illegal under\u201d Title VII.  \nFurnco, 438 U.S. at 576 (quotation omitted). \n\n22 \n \n1. \nIn \u201creverse\u201d discrimination \ncases, the Sixth, Seventh, \nEighth, Tenth, and D.C. \nCircuits describe the prima \nfacie case\u2019s first step as a \nshowing about background \ncircumstances. \nThe D.C. Circuit was one of the first courts to ap-\nply McDonnell Douglas to a \u201creverse\u201d discrimination \nclaim.  It noted that \u201c[m]embership in a socially dis-\nfavored group was the assumption on which the en-\ntire McDonnell Douglas analysis was predicated,\u201d \nand that the first element of the prima facie test \ntherefore necessarily needed to adapt when a mem-\nber of a majority group filed a Title VII claim.  Par-\nker, 652 F.2d at 1017   Applying a modified version of \nMcDonnell Douglas, it held that a plaintiff who is a \nmember of a majority group makes out a prima facie \nshowing of discrimination when she demonstrates \nthat \u201cbackground circumstances support the suspi-\ncion that the defendant is that unusual employer \nwho discriminates against the majority.\u201d  See id.  \nSuch circumstances, the D.C. Circuit wrote, \u201cserved \nas a functional equivalent of the first McDonnell \nDouglas criterion, membership in a racial minority.\u201d  \nId. at 1018.  Applying that standard, the court held \nthat the plaintiff in Parker made out a prima facie \ncase of discrimination when he pointed to a racially \ndiscriminatory work environment.  Id.  Subsequent \nD.C. Circuit decisions made clear that the \u201cback-\nground circumstances\u201d element is not intended to \ndisadvantage plaintiffs who are members of majority \ngroups, nor is it \u201can additional hurdle.\u201d  Harding v. \nGray, 9 F.3d 150, 153\u201354 (D.C. Cir. 1993).  It is simp-\nly a tool for \u201cdetermining when an employer\u2019s con-\n\n23 \n \nduct raises an inference of discrimination under the \nSupreme \nCourt\u2019s \nMcDonnell \nDouglas/Burdine \nstandard.\u201d  Id. at 153.  \nFollowing Parker, the Sixth, Seventh, Eighth, and \nTenth circuits have used the \u201cbackground circum-\nstances\u201d language to describe the first component of \na prima facie analysis for \u201creverse\u201d discrimination \nclaims.  Like the D.C. Circuit, however, those circuits \nhave emphasized that \u201cbackground circumstances\u201d \ncomponent is easily satisfied.  Most significantly for \npurposes of this case, the Sixth Circuit has held that \nthe background circumstances \u201crequirement is not \nonerous, and can be met through a variety of means.\u201d  \nJohnson, 502 F. App\u2019x at 536.  A male plaintiff in a \nfailure-to-hire case, for example, can satisfy the re-\nquirement by showing that the decisionmaker and \nthe person ultimately hired were both women.  See \nPet.App.6a.  He can demonstrate \u201cbackground cir-\ncumstances,\u201d in other words, by showing that he was \nin the minority in the relevant sense. \nThe Sixth Circuit\u2019s recent decisions, which make \nclear that a plaintiff\u2019s burden is not onerous, also put \nto rest any concerns in older Sixth Circuit decisions \nthat majority-group plaintiffs may bear a high bur-\nden.  See Pierce v. Commonwealth Life Ins. Co., 40 \nF.3d 796, 801 n.7 (6th Cir. 1994); cf. Briggs v. Porter, \n463 F.3d 507, 517 (6th Cir. 2006) (describing a plain-\ntiff\u2019s burden as \u201cmore difficult\u201d).  To the extent that \nthe Sixth Circuit in past decades may have expressed \nmisgivings about the \u201cbackground circumstances\u201d \nanalysis, its more recent decisions have clarified the \nshowing\u2019s low bar.  See Johnson, 502 F. App\u2019x at 536. \nThe Seventh, Eighth, and Tenth Circuits also do \nnot treat the background circumstances requirement \n\n24 \n \nas onerous.  They too look to it as nothing more than \na substitute for otherwise inapplicable elements of \nthe prima facie test discussed in McDonnell Douglas.  \nThe Seventh Circuit, in adopting a background cir-\ncumstances requirement, emphasized that the re-\nquirement \u201cis not to be interpreted in a constricting \nfashion.\u201d  Mills v. Health Care Serv. Corp., 171 F.3d \n450, 457 (7th Cir. 1999).  And the Eighth Circuit and \nTenth Circuits have likewise treated the background \ncircumstances component of a prima facie case not as \na \u201chigher\u201d or \u201cadditional\u201d burden, but simply an al-\nternative showing that plaintiffs must make \u201cin lieu \nof\u201d showing that the plaintiff belongs to a minority \ngroup.  Notari v. Denver Water Dep\u2019t., 971 F.2d 585, \n589 (10th Cir. 1992); Hammer v. Ashcroft, 383 F.3d \n722, 724 (8th Cir. 2004); see also Duffy v. Wolle, 123 \nF.3d 1026, 1035\u201337 (8th Cir. 1997) (applying \nMcDonnell Douglas framework to a Bivens v. Six \nUnknown Fed. Narcotics Agents, 403 U.S. 388, (1971) \nclaim). \nMost significantly, none of the circuits that use \nthe \u201cbackground circumstances\u201d language dispute \nthat plaintiffs who are members of a majority group \nare \u201centitled to the same Title VII protection as a \nminority plaintiff.\u201d  Harding, 9 F.3d at 153; see also \nThistledown Racing, 770 F.2d at 67 (\u201cTitle VII, of \ncourse, prohibits racial discrimination against all \ngroups\u201d); Mills, 171 F.3d at 454\u201355 (\u201c[I]t is well set-\ntled law that the protections of Title VII are not lim-\nited to members of historically discriminated-against \ngroups.\u201d); Schaffhauser v. UPS, 794 F.3d 899, 902 \n(8th Cir. 2015) (\u201cTitle VII prohibits an employer from \ndiscriminating against any individual \u2018because of \nsuch individual\u2019s race.\u2019\u201d (emphasis added)); Notari, \n971 F.2d at 588 (noting that \u201cit is clear that Title \n\n25 \n \nVII\u2019s protection is not limited to those individuals \nwho are members of historically or socially disfa-\nvored groups\u201d). \n2. \nThe Third and Eleventh \nCircuits are in accord with \nthe other circuits. \nAmes argues that there is a direct conflict be-\ntween the Third and Eleventh Circuits and those cir-\ncuits that apply a \u201cbackground circumstances\u201d re-\nquirement as part of the prima facie test for \u201creverse\u201d \ndiscrimination claims.  The Third and Eleventh cir-\ncuits, she claims have \u201cexplicitly rejected\u201d such a re-\nquirement.  Pet.19.  Ames overreads those decisions.  \nWhile the Third and Eleventh Circuits have chosen \nnot to apply an explicit \u201cbackground circumstances\u201d \nrequirement, those circuits still apply the same basic \nTitle VII standard that other circuits apply. \nThe Third Circuit, it is true, has declined to adopt \nthe \u201cbackground circumstances\u201d language in \u201cre-\nverse\u201d discrimination cases.  Iadimarco v. Runyon, \n190 F.3d 151, 160 (3d Cir. 1999).  But it has never-\ntheless recognized that there are problems with the \n\u201cwording of the very first prong of the McDonnell \nDouglas [prima facie] test\u201d that mandate at least \nsome modification of that test with respect to \u201cre-\nverse\u201d discrimination claims.  Id. at 158.  Rather \nthan use the language of \u201cbackground circumstanc-\nes,\u201d however, it has held that a Title VII plaintiff \n\u201cshould be able to establish a prima facie case \u2026 by \npresenting sufficient evidence to allow a reasonable \nfact finder to conclude (given the totality of the cir-\ncumstances) that the defendant treated [a] plaintiff \n\u2018less favorably than others because of [his] race, col-\nor, religion, sex, or national origin.\u2019\u201d  Id. at 163 (quot-\n\n26 \n \ning Furnco, 438 U.S. at 577).  That is not meaning-\nfully different from the legal standard that other cir-\ncuits apply.  The Third Circuit in fact acknowledged \nthat the background-circumstances requirement, as \napplied by the circuits that have adopted it, often re-\nquires only that a plaintiff offer \u201csufficient evidence \nto support the reasonable probability of discrimina-\ntion.\u201d  Id. at 162. \nAt least one member of the Iadimarco panel be-\nlieved the primary difference between the test that \nthe Third Circuit adopted and the \u201cbackground cir-\ncumstances\u201d test was their wording and that the \nThird Circuit\u2019s test was \u201cmerely a restatement of the \nMcDonnell Douglas test.\u201d  Id. at 163 n.10.  That \nmember of the panel rejected the \u201cbackground cir-\ncumstances\u201d phrasing not because it was necessarily \nan incorrect statement of law, but because its fram-\ning was \u201cjust too vague and too prone to misinterpre-\ntation and confusion to apply fairly and consistently.\u201d  \nId.   \nThe other Third Circuit decisions that Ames cites \nalso do not support her claimed split.  The Third Cir-\ncuit did not discuss \u201cbackground circumstances\u201d at \nall in Phillips v. Legacy Cabinets, 87 F.4th 1313 \n(11th Cir. 2023).  Even if it had, it would not have \nmattered.  Because the plaintiff and the relevant de-\ncisionmaker were of different races, see id. at 1316, \nthe plaintiff would have been able to demonstrate \nbackground \ncircumstances \nin \nany \nevent, \nsee \nPet.App.5a.  Ellis v. Bank of N.Y. Mellon Corp, is \neven less relevant; all that the Third Circuit did in \nthat case was state the obvious proposition that a \n\u201creverse\u201d discrimination plaintiff \u201cneed not show she \n\n27 \n \nis a member of a minority group.\u201d  837 F. App\u2019x 940, \n941 n.3 (2021). \nThe Eleventh Circuit decisions that Ames cites \nare of even less relevance.  Two of the cases did not \ninvolve McDonnell Douglas\u2019s prima facie test at all.  \nBass v. Bd. of County Comm\u2019rs, 256 F.3d 1095, 1104  \n(11th Cir. 2001) (\u201cIn this case, the County has not \ndisputed that Bass established a prima facie case of \ndiscrimination under the McDonnell Douglas frame-\nwork.\u201d); Smith v. Lockheed-Martin Corp., 644 F.3d \n1321, 1328 (11th Cir. 2011) (\u201cHere, Mitten did not \nneed to rely on the McDonnell Douglas presumption \nto establish a case for the jury.\u201d).  Any discussion of \nthe \u201cbackground circumstances\u201d element in those de-\ncisions was therefore dicta.  But even then, to the ex-\ntent that the Eleventh District in Bass \u201cexplicitly\u201d \nrejected anything, it was the \u201creverse discrimination\u201d \nlabel.  See Bass, 256 F.3d at 1102\u201303.  Its decision, in \nthat respect, was little more than an uncontroversial \nrecognition that Title VII applies equally to all plain-\ntiffs.  See id.  And Smith, for its part, simply cited \nBass for the principle that a plaintiff need not show \n\u201cbackground circumstances\u201d that suggest discrimina-\ntion.  See 644 F.3d at 1325 n.15.  But if Bass did not \ndecide that question, then neither can it be said did \nSmith. \nDicta aside, the legal test that the Eleventh Cir-\ncuit applied in Smith is, in practice, functionally sim-\nilar to the test that other circuits apply.  It held that \na plaintiff can prevail on a discrimination claim if \n\u201cthe record, viewed in a light most favorable to the \nplaintiff, presents \u2018a convincing mosaic of circum-\nstantial evidence that would allow a jury to infer in-\ntentional discrimination by the decisionmaker.\u2019\u201d  \n\n28 \n \nSmith, 644 F.3d at 1328.  And in other cases, the \nEleventh Circuit has held that its \u201cmosaic\u201d standard \naddresses the same question as \u201cwhen using the \nMcDonnell Douglas framework.\u201d  Tynes v. Fla. Dep\u2019t \nof Juvenile Justice, 88 F.4th 939, 947 (2023).  To be \nsure, some members of the Eleventh Circuit would go \neven further and would abandon McDonnell Douglas \ncompletely.  See id. at 949\u201358 (Newsome, J., concur-\nring).  But whether McDonnell Douglas has outlived \nits usefulness is a question that must wait for anoth-\ner day\u2014and for a party to raise it.  Ames has explic-\nitly declined to do so here.  See Pet.28 n.3. \n3. \nThe First, Second, Fourth, \nFifth, and Ninth Circuits \napply a largely similar prima \nfacie standard. \nAmes identifies two different categories of circuits \nthat, she claims, have implicitly rejected a back-\nground circumstances requirement: those that have \ndeclined to decide whether to apply such a require-\nment and those that have been entirely silent on the \nquestion.  See Pet.22\u201323.   \na. The Second, Fourth, and Ninth Circuits are in \nthe first category of cases.  They have acknowledged \nthe \u201cbackground circumstances\u201d requirement but \nhave not decided whether such a requirement should \nbe part of the prima facie test for \u201creverse\u201d discrimi-\nnation claims.  The fact that they have not taken a \nposition on the Question Presented means, by defini-\ntion, that they are not part of any circuit split.  That \nbeing said, however, the test that those circuits have \napplied is not meaningfully different from the test \nthat other circuits apply.  Like the Sixth, Seventh, \nEighth, Tenth, and D.C. Circuits, the Second, \n\n29 \n \nFourth, and Ninth Circuits all ask whether a plain-\ntiff has pointed to facts that would suggest the pres-\nence of discrimination. \nRather than linger on the framing of the \u201cback-\nground circumstances\u201d requirement, the Second Cir-\ncuit has focused on the ultimate question that \nMcDonnell Douglas was designed to address.  The \nrelevant question for any discrimination claim, it has \nnoted, is whether the events that give rise to a plain-\ntiff\u2019s complaint occurred \u201cunder circumstances which \ngive rise to an inference of unlawful discrimination.\u201d  \nAulicino v. New York Dep\u2019t of Homeless Servs., 580 \nF.3d 73, 80 (2d Cir. 2009) (quotation omitted).  In the \n\u201cconflict\u201d case that Ames cites, the Second Circuit \nheld that it did not need to decide whether to de-\nmand evidence of \u201cbackground circumstances\u201d be-\ncause the plaintiff\u2019s evidence sufficiently demon-\nstrated those circumstances, even if that require-\nment applied.  Id. at 80 n.5.   \nThe Fourth Circuit has adopted a similar ap-\nproach.  It has held that plaintiffs in all discrimina-\ntion cases must point to \u201csome evidence that race \nwas a determining factor in the employer\u2019s decision.\u201d  \nHolmes v. Bevilacqua, 794 F.2d 142, 147 (4th 1986) \n(en banc).  And while it has \u201cexpressly decline[d] to \ndecide \u2026 whether a higher burden\u201d applies to plain-\ntiffs who bring a \u201creverse\u201d discrimination claim, it \nhas held that the burden that its precedent calls for \nis not meaningfully different from the standard that \nthe D.C. Circuit discussed in Parker.  Lucas v. Dole, \n835 F.2d 532, 533\u201334 & n.9 (4th Cir. 1987) (emphasis \nadded). \nFinally, the Ninth Circuit fits into this category \nas well.  In an unpublished decision, it also chose not \n\n30 \n \nto weigh in on how the first component of the \nMcDonnell Douglas prima facie test should be modi-\nfied when faced with a \u201creverse\u201d discrimination \nclaim.  Zottola v. City of Oakland, 32 F. App\u2019x 307, \n311 (9th Cir. 2002).  The plaintiff\u2019s claim in that case, \nthe court held, failed with or without a \u201cbackground \ncircumstances\u201d requirement.  Id. at 311.  The only \nother Ninth Circuit decision that Ames cites also did \nnot address the Question Presented here.  The court \nin that case asked the same question that all other \ncircuits ask: did the plaintiffs provide evidence that \n\u201cgives rise to an inference of unlawful discrimina-\ntion\u201d?  See Hawn v. Exec. Jet Mgmt., 615 F.3d 1151, \n1156 (9th Cir. 2010) (quotation omitted). \nb. The First and Fifth Circuits belong to the sec-\nond category of circuits that Ames identifies: those \nthat have not discussed the \u201cbackground circum-\nstances\u201d element at all.  Like the circuits that have \nexpressly declined to decide whether or how to adjust \nMcDonnell Douglas\u2019s prima facie elements to account \nfor \u201creverse\u201d discrimination claims, the silence of the \nFirst and Fifth Circuits means that they cannot be \nproperly said to conflict with the other circuits.  And \neven though the First and Fifth Circuits have not \naddressed whether a \u201cbackground circumstances\u201d el-\nement is part of the prima facie test for \u201creverse\u201d dis-\ncrimination claims, the legal standard that they ap-\nply is still consistent with the standard that courts \nthat have adopted such a component apply.   \nThe First Circuit in Williams v. Raytheon Co., 220 \nF.3d 16 (1st Cir. 2000), for example, stated that the \nburden of establishing a prima facie case under \nMcDonnell Douglas is \u201cnot onerous.\u201d  Id. at 19.  To \nthe extent that the First Circuit did not discuss the \n\n31 \n \ncomponents of the prima facie test in greater detail, \nthat is because, after briefly discussing those ele-\nments, it largely \u201cput[] aside\u201d those elements and \u201cas \n[it has] often done,\u201d turned \u201cto whether there is evi-\ndence that, notwithstanding the employer\u2019s stated \nreasons for the termination, the real reason, at least \nin part, was \u2026 discrimination.\u201d  See Fontanez-Nunez \nv. Janssen Ortho, LLC, 447 F.3d 50, 56 (1st Cir. \n2006) (quotation omitted).  That is, it focused on the \nquestion of pretext.  Having done so, it held that the \nplaintiff\u2019s claim failed because his evidence did not \n\u201csupport a reasonable inference that [the employer] \nacted out of a discriminatory purpose.\u201d  Williams, \n220 F.3d at 20. \n The Fifth Circuit\u2019s approach in Byers v. Dallas \nMorning News, Inc., 209 F.3d 419 (5th Cir. 2000) is \nsimilar.  Like the First Circuit in Williams, it also \ndid not discuss a \u201cbackground circumstances\u201d ap-\nproach to the prima facie test like the one that some \ncircuits have used.  See id. 425\u201327.  It asked instead \nwhether the plaintiff had carried his burden of pro-\nducing \u201csufficient evidence indirectly demonstrating \ndiscriminatory intent.\u201d  Id. at 427.  The plaintiff in \nWilliams had not done so, the Fifth Circuit held, be-\ncause the only evidence of discrimination he had of-\nfered was \u201chis subjective belief.\u201d  Id.  The Fifth Cir-\ncuit\u2019s requirement that a plaintiff introduce enough \nindirect evidence to suggest a discriminatory motive \nis not meaningfully different from the \u201cbackground \ncircumstances\u201d requirement that other circuits have \nadopted.  The main difference is the label that those \ncircuits have assigned to that element of the prima \nfacie test. \n\n32 \n \nC. \nDistrict court uncertainty is not a \nreason to grant Ames\u2019s petition for \na writ of certiorari. \nHaving failed to make a compelling case that the \ncircuits are divided in a way that meaningfully af-\nfects the outcome of Title VII cases, Ames turns to \nthe district courts.  But even if she is right that some \ndistrict courts are confused about how to apply \nMcDonnell Douglas\u2019s test to \u201creverse\u201d discrimination \nclaims, the remedy for that confusion is further re-\nview in the circuit courts.  Those courts, not this one, \nare best suited to resolve any district court uncer-\ntainty or disagreement.  See Stephen Shapiro, et al., \nSupreme Court Practice, 505 (10th ed. 2013) (federal \ndistrict court conflicts \u201ccan be eliminated by the \ncourts of appeals\u201d); see also S. Ct. Prac. R. 10 (focus-\ning on United States courts of appeals decisions \nwhen considering whether certiorari is warranted).   \n* \n* \n* \nAt bottom, the circuits\u2019 slight variations in ap-\nproaching \u201creverse\u201d discrimination claims involves \nan almost-never-dispositive difference that largely \nboils down to differing verbal formulations.  And \nthose differences cropped up decades ago.  If this is a \nsplit at all, it is stale and largely irrelevant.    \nIII. \nThe Sixth Circuit faithfully applied this \nCourt\u2019s precedent when it held that Ames \nhad not made out a prima facie case of \ndiscrimination. \nRegardless of whether a circuit split exists, the \nSixth Circuit faithfully applies this Court\u2019s precedent \nwhen reviewing Title VII claims.  It has recognized \nthat \u201cTitle VII, of course, prohibits racial discrimina-\n\n33 \n \ntion against all groups.\u201d  Thistledown Racing, 770 \nF.2d at 67 (citing McDonald, 427 U.S. at 276, 279 \n(1976)).  The \u201cbackground circumstances\u201d element \nthat it applies to \u201creverse\u201d discrimination claims re-\nflects this Court\u2019s own focus on whether a plaintiff\u2019s \nallegations \u201c\u2018if otherwise unexplained, are more like-\nly than not based on the consideration of impermis-\nsible factors.\u2019\u201d  Burdine, 450 U.S. at 254 (quoting \nFurnco, 438 U.S. at 577).  And just like this Court \nhas held that McDonnell Douglas\u2019s prima facie \nstandard \u201cwas \u2018never intended to be rigid, mecha-\nnized, or ritualistic,\u2019\u201d Aikens, 460 U.S. at 715, the \nSixth Circuit has recognized that its \u201cbackground \ncircumstances\u201d requirement is \u201cnot onerous\u201d and \nmay be satisfied \u201cthrough a variety of means,\u201d John-\nson, 502 F. App\u2019x at 536. \nTo the extent that the panel\u2019s decision in this case \ncan be read as inflexibly applying a \u201cbackground cir-\ncumstances\u201d requirement, that is likely because of \nthe way Ames chose to litigate her appeal.  She did \nnot challenge the \u201cbackground circumstances\u201d re-\nquirement in any way and, by arguing that she had \ndemonstrated background circumstances, implicitly \naccepted it.  See, Ames Br., App.R.21 at 17\u201320.  In \ndoing so, she offered two reasons why background \ncircumstances existed: the identity of the deci-\nsionmaker (an argument that the panel held she had \nforfeited, see Pet.App.6a) and her own experiences.  \nSee id.  The fact that the panel focused solely on \nthose elements shows only that it engaged with \nAmes\u2019s arguments and wanted to succinctly dispose \nof her claims.  That the panel did not more thorough-\nly discuss an issue that neither of the parties had \nraised is, at most, a drafting issue that does not cre-\n\n34 \n \nate a circuit split\u2014let alone warrant this Court\u2019s re-\nview. \nThis case shows why all plaintiffs, including those \nwho bring \u201creverse\u201d discrimination claims, must \nmake some threshold showing that suggests discrim-\nination.  And it shows why, even if the circuit split \nthat Ames purports to identify exists, there is no \nmeaningful split about the outcome of this case.  The \nacid test for cert-worthiness is whether a case would \ncome out different in different circuits.  This case \nwould not.  \nAmes\u2019s evidence in this case was this: She was a \nwoman who did not receive a job for which she quali-\nfied and to which she had applied.  Walburn, one of \nthe individuals who was responsible for hiring for \nthat job, was also a woman.  And the person who was \nultimately hired for the job was also a woman\u2014and \nwas qualified for the position.  The woman who was \nhired was gay, however, and Ames was not.   \nAmes did not identify any evidence that suggest-\ned sexual orientation played any role in the hiring \ndecision, however.  She did not point to any evidence \nindicating that the relevant decisionmakers were \ngay.  Nor did she point to any evidence suggesting \nthat the decisionmakers knew the sexual orientation \nof either Ames or of the woman that they ultimately \nhired.  She instead conceded in the district court that \nthe Department\u2019s statement of the facts was correct.  \nSee Opposition to Motion for Summary Judgment, \nR.72, PageID#2488 n.1.  Without such evidence, \nthere is nothing that \u201craises an inference of discrimi-\nnation \u2026 if otherwise unexplained.\u201d  See Burdine, \n450 U.S. at 254 (quotation omitted).  Thus, under \nany formulation of McDonnell Douglas\u2019s prima facie \n\n35 \n \ntest, Ames\u2019s claim would fail.  If the Court were to \nhold otherwise, and if it were to hold that Ames es-\ntablished a prima facie case of discrimination in this \ncase anyway, then McDonnell Douglas\u2019s prima facie \nscreening test will have lost almost all of its mean-\ning.  \nCONCLUSION \nThe Court should deny the petition for a writ of \ncertiorari.  \n \nRespectfully submitted, \n \nDAVE YOST \nAttorney General of Ohio \nMICHAEL J.

          "task_beliefs": "The latest observation was a failed attempt to retrieve the Respondent's Merits Brief. The search returned the Brief in Opposition, a document I have already analyzed. As such, this observation provides no new substantive information about the case, and my core task-level beliefs (\u03b8) remain stable, but the context around my information gap has changed significantly.\n\n*   **Case Status (Stable):** The Supreme Court granted certiorari on October 4, 2024. The Court's decision to take the case remains the primary signal of its intent to rule on the merits of the \"background circumstances\" test, especially given the respondent's strong procedural objections in the Brief in Opposition (BIO).\n*   **Core Legal Question (Stable):** The question presented is unchanged: Does Title VII require a plaintiff from a majority group to show \"background circumstances\" to establish a prima facie case?\n*   **Petitioner's Merits Arguments (Stable):** My model of the petitioner's arguments is unchanged. They will argue for a uniform pleading standard based on a textualist reading of Title VII (\"any individual\"), supported by the logic of *McDonald v. Santa Fe Trail Transp. Co.* and *Bostock v. Clayton County*.\n*   **Respondent's Cert-Stage Arguments (Re-confirmed):** This observation, by returning the BIO again, re-confirms the respondent's cert-stage strategy. They are heavily invested in arguing that the case is a poor vehicle due to (1) forfeiture, (2) outcome-irrelevance, and (3) their tacit concession that the \"background circumstances\" test is weak post-*SFFA*.\n*   **Prediction (Stable, Maximum Uncertainty):** My prediction remains sharply bifurcated, and the tension between the two possibilities is now at its peak due to the persistent information gap.\n    *   **Possibility 1: Merits Reversal.** If the Court reaches the merits, a reversal of the Sixth Circuit is highly probable. The respondent's cert-stage arguments are a strong signal that they cannot or will not defend the \"background circumstances\" test on the merits.\n    *   **Possibility 2: Dismissal as Improvidently Granted (DIG).** The procedural \"vehicle problems\" raised by the respondent are substantial. The repeated failure to find the Respondent's Merits Brief makes this possibility more salient, as it prevents me from assessing whether the respondent has shifted their strategy.\n*   **Information Gap (CRITICAL & ACUTE):** The failure of a more precise search to locate the **Respondent's Merits Brief** has elevated this from a critical gap to an acute, mission-blocking problem. My entire predictive model is now stalled. This document is the only thing that can resolve the central uncertainty: will the respondent continue to press for a DIG on procedural grounds, or will they be forced to defend the \"background circumstances\" test on the merits? The former increases the odds of a DIG; the latter makes a merits reversal almost certain. Without this document, my belief state cannot advance.",
          "design_beliefs": "This observation, a second consecutive failure to retrieve a key document, is extremely valuable for refining my design-level beliefs (D), particularly concerning information retrieval strategy and modeling the limitations of my available tools.\n\n**Foundational & Tactical Heuristics (Stable):**\n*   My core heuristics (#1-15) for legal analysis remain valid.\n\n**Meta-Heuristics (Reinforced and Refined):**\n*   **18-20 (Stable):** Heuristics regarding anomalous data, document precedence, and retrieval resilience are stable.\n*   **21. The DBOED Loop (Strongly Reinforced):** This observation represents a frustrating but essential turn of the DBOED cycle. My experiment (a refined search query) failed, providing a clear outcome. I am now updating my beliefs about my search tactics and the search tool itself. This failure, while unproductive for \u03b8, is highly productive for D, as it forces a re-evaluation of my experimental design.\n*   **22. The Principle of Document Verification and Semantic Drift (Reinforced):** The problem is not one of verification\u2014I can correctly identify the BIO. The problem is one of retrieval; the search tool is exhibiting semantic drift by returning a cert-stage document in response to a merits-stage query.\n*   **23. The Value of \"Near Miss\" Data (Stable):** This principle is stable.\n*   **24. The Heuristic of Strategic Recapitulation (Strongly Reinforced):** This failure powerfully reinforces the distinction between a sound strategy and flawed tactics. My *strategy*\u2014to find the Respondent's Merits Brief\u2014remains correct and is the most information-rich path forward. My *tactics*\u2014the specific search queries\u2014have been proven insufficient. This observation confirms I should not abandon the strategic goal but must innovate on the tactical execution.\n*   **25-26 (Stable):** The \"Vehicle Problem\" and \"Pre-Merits Documents\" heuristics remain stable.\n*   **27. The Heuristic of Docket Search Precision (Significantly Refined):** This is the most important update. The failure of my refined query (`'Brief for respondent on the merits'`) provides a crucial new insight: **I must model the limitations and behavior of the search tool itself.**\n    *   **Previous belief:** Adding procedurally specific keywords (`#27a`) would be sufficient to narrow the search.\n    *   **Updated belief:** The search tool's algorithm may be more simplistic than assumed. It appears to be performing a keyword match that prioritizes the high-frequency terms \"Brief for respondent\" over the full, procedurally specific phrase \"on the merits.\" It is unable to distinguish between the cert-stage \"Brief in Opposition\" and a merits-stage brief.\n    *   **New Sub-Heuristic (`#27e`): Model the Tool.** My information-gathering plan must account for the specific quirks of the search tool. A logically perfect query is useless if the underlying search algorithm cannot parse it correctly. Future queries must be designed not just for logical precision but also to \"outsmart\" or work around the tool's limitations. This may involve using negative constraints (e.g., excluding \"opposition\" or \"certiorari\"), searching different metadata fields, or trying radically different keyword combinations. This failure has shifted my focus from simply refining legal terminology to actively reverse-engineering my search tool's behavior."
