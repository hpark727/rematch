    "legal_questions": [
      "Can retailers who would sell a new tobacco product seek judicial review of the FDA\u2019s denial of a manufacturer\u2019s marketing application under the Tobacco Control Act?"

    "facts_of_the_case": "R.J. Reynolds Vapor Company manufactures e-cigarettes, including the popular menthol- and mixed-berry-flavored Vuse Alto products. When the FDA announced in 2016 that e-cigarettes would be regulated as \u201cnew tobacco products\u201d under the Tobacco Control Act, RJR Vapor timely applied for authorization to continue marketing its Vuse Alto products. Three years later, the FDA denied the applications, finding that RJR Vapor had failed to demonstrate that marketing these products would be \u201cappropriate for the protection of the public health.\u201d Rather than challenging the denial alone in either the D.C. Circuit or the Fourth Circuit (where it could properly file), RJR Vapor joined with retailers to file a joint petition in the Fifth Circuit: Avail Vapor Texas, L.L.C. (a Texas company operating a Vuse store in Houston), the Mississippi Petroleum Marketers and Convenience Stores Association, and another RJR corporate affiliate that sold Vuse products online.\n\nThe FDA moved to dismiss the joint petition for lack of venue or alternatively to transfer it to the D.C. Circuit or Fourth Circuit, arguing that only disappointed applicants\u2014not retailers\u2014are \u201cadversely affected\u201d by denial orders under the Tobacco Control Act and thus have the right to seek judicial review. A divided panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit denied the FDA\u2019s motion, concluding that venue was proper because the retailers were \u201cadversely affected\u201d by the denial order and could properly petition for review.",

It will detail their textual, structural, and precedential reasoning, moving my belief from a general awareness to a specific, actionable understanding of the petitioner's case. This is a foundational document for prediction. For design, this action directly tests and will likely confirm my newly formed heuristic that prioritizing primary legal documents\u2014especially the cert petition from the Solicitor General\u2014is a highly effective strategy. Observing how the SG frames the issue for the Court provides valuable meta-information that refines this heuristic for future cases.

L. No. 111-31, Div. A, 123 Stat. 1776, re-\nquires a person to obtain authorization from the Food \nand Drug Administration (FDA) before introducing a \nnew tobacco product into interstate commerce.  If FDA \ndenies an application for authorization, \u201cany person ad-\nversely affected by such  * * *  denial may file a petition \nfor judicial review of such  * * *  denial with the United \nStates Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia or \nfor the circuit in which such person resides or has their \nprincipal place of business.\u201d  21 U.S.C. 387l(a)(1).  The \nU.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit has deter-\nmined that a manufacturer may seek judicial review in \nthat circuit even if it neither resides nor has its principal \nplace of business there, so long as its petition is joined \nby a seller of its products, such as a gas station or con-\nvenience store, based in the circuit.  The question pre-\nsented is: \nWhether a manufacturer may file a petition for re-\nview in a circuit (other than the D.C. Circuit) where it \nneither resides nor has its principal place of business, if \nthe petition is joined by a seller of the manufacturer\u2019s \nproducts that is located within that circuit. \n \n \n\n \n(II) \nPARTIES TO THE PROCEEDING \nPetitioners (respondents below) are the Food and \nDrug Administration (FDA); Robert Califf, in his offi-\ncial capacity as Commissioner of FDA; the Department \nof Health and Human Services; and Xavier Becerra, in \nhis official capacity as Secretary of Health and Human \nServices.

REYNOLDS VAPOR CO., ET AL. \n \nON PETITION FOR A WRIT OF CERTIORARI \nTO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS \nFOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT \n \nPETITION FOR A WRIT OF CERTIORARI \n \nThe Solicitor General, on behalf of the petitioners, \nrespectfully petitions for a writ of certiorari to review \nthe order of the United States Court of Appeals for the \nFifth Circuit in this case. \nOPINIONS BELOW \nThe order of the court of appeals (App., infra, 1a-8a) \nis unreported. \nJURISDICTION \nThe order of the court of appeals was entered on \nFebruary 2, 2024.  The jurisdiction of this Court is in-\nvoked under 28 U.S.C. 1254(1). \nSTATUTORY PROVISION INVOLVED \nThe pertinent statutory provision is reproduced in \nthe appendix.  App., infra, 24a. \n\n2 \n \nSTATEMENT \n1. In 2009, Congress enacted the Family Smoking \nPrevention and Tobacco Control Act (Tobacco Control \nAct or Act), Pub. L. No. 111-31, Div. A, 123 Stat. 1776.  \nThe Act imposes special restrictions on the marketing \nof \u201c\u200a\u2018new tobacco products\u2019\u200a\u201d\u2014that is, tobacco products \nthat were not commercially marketed in the United \nStates as of February 15, 2007.  21 U.S.C. 387j(a)(1).  A \nmanufacturer may introduce a new tobacco product into \ninterstate commerce only if it obtains authorization \nfrom the Secretary of Health and Human Services.  See \n21 U.S.C. 387j(c)(2)(A).  The Secretary exercises that \nauthority through the Food and Drug Administration \n(FDA).  See 21 U.S.C. 393(d)(2). \nThe Act provides that \u201cany person adversely af-\nfected\u201d by the \u201cdenial of an application\u201d for marketing \nauthorization \u201cmay file a petition for judicial review\u201d \nwithin 30 days after the denial.  21 U.S.C. 387l(a)(1)(B).  \nThe petition must be filed \u201cwith the United States Court \nof Appeals for the District of Columbia or for the circuit \nin which such person resides or has their principal place \nof business.\u201d  21 U.S.C. 387l(a)(1).  The court must re-\nview the agency action in accordance with the judicial-\nreview provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act \n(APA), 5 U.S.C. 701 et seq.  See 21 U.S.C. 387l(b). \nIn 2016, FDA promulgated a rule announcing that it \nwould regulate electronic nicotine delivery systems, \nmore commonly known as e-cigarettes or vapes, in ac-\ncordance with the Act.  See Deeming Tobacco Products \nTo Be Subject to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic \nAct, as Amended by the Family Smoking Prevention \nand Tobacco Control Act; Restrictions on the Sale and \nDistribution of Tobacco Products and Required Warn-\ning Statements for Tobacco Products; Final Rule, 81 \n\n3 \n \nFed. Reg. 28,974, 29,028-29,044 (May 10, 2016).  An  \ne-cigarette is a battery-powered device that heats a liq-\nuid containing nicotine and other substances, convert-\ning the liquid into an aerosol (a suspension of small air-\nborne droplets) that the user inhales.  See Centers for \nDisease Control and Prevention (CDC), U.S. Dep\u2019t of \nHealth and Human Services, E-Cigarette, or Vaping, \nProducts Visual Dictionary 7.  E-cigarettes generally \nqualify as \u201cnew tobacco products\u201d because they were \nnot on the market as of February 15, 2007.  See Avail \nVapor, LLC v. FDA, 55 F.4th 409, 414 (4th Cir. 2022), \ncert. denied, 144 S. Ct. 277 (2023).   \n2. Respondent R.J. Reynolds Vapor Co. (Reynolds) \nmanufactures e-cigarette products under the brand \nname Vuse.  See App., infra, 13a.  Reynolds is incorpo-\nrated, and thus resides, in North Carolina, and it main-\ntains its principal place of business in Winston-Salem, \nNorth Carolina.  See R.J. Reynolds Vapor Co., Busi-\nness Corporation Annual Report, F.Y. 2022, at 1 (Jan. \n30, 2023).   \nReynolds applied for authorization to market three \nsets of flavored e-cigarette products:  Vuse Vibe, Vuse \nSolo, and Vuse Alto.  We refer to the Fifth Circuit case \nconcerning Vuse Vibe (No. 23-60037) as Vibe, the case \nconcerning Vuse Solo (No. 23-60128) as Solo, and the \ncase concerning Vuse Alto (No. 23-60545) as Alto.  This \npetition for a writ of certiorari seeks review of an order \nissued in Alto, but we describe the proceedings in all \nthree cases because they provide relevant context.   \nFDA denied all three sets of applications.  See Vibe \nC.A. Pet. for Review, Ex. A at 1-4 (Jan. 24, 2023); Solo \nC.A. Pet. for Review, Ex. A 1-4 (Mar. 17, 2023); App., \ninfra, 9a-23a.  The Act permits FDA to grant marketing \nauthorization only if the manufacturer shows that the \n\n4 \n \nmarketing of the product is \u201cappropriate for the protec-\ntion of the public health.\u201d  21 U.S.C. 387j(a)(2)(A).  FDA \nfound that Reynolds had failed to make that showing.  \nSee Vibe C.A. Pet. for Review, Ex. A at 1; Solo C.A. Pet. \nfor Review, Ex. A at 1; App., infra, 9a-10a.  \n3. Reynolds filed three petitions for review, which \nthe court of appeals later consolidated.  See Vibe C.A. \nDoc. 231 (Oct. 19, 2023). \na. Under the Act, Reynolds could have filed a peti-\ntion for review in either the Fourth Circuit (where it is \nbased) or the D.C. Circuit.  See App., infra, 7a (Hig-\nginson, J., dissenting).  But \u201c[t]hose two courts ha[d] al-\nready ruled on questions central to these cases in a man-\nner that is adverse to Reynolds\u2019 position.\u201d  Ibid.  In par-\nticular, Reynolds claims that FDA acted arbitrarily and \ncapriciously by, among other things, changing the evi-\ndentiary standards for flavored e-cigarette products af-\nter manufacturers had submitted their applications.  \nSee Vibe C.A. Doc. 62, at 12-18 (Feb. 8, 2023).  The \nFourth and D.C. Circuits had previously rejected simi-\nlar claims.  See Avail Vapor, 55 F.4th at 422 (4th Cir.); \nProhibition Juice Co. v. FDA, 45 F.4th 8, 21 (D.C. Cir. \n2022). \nReynolds filed its petitions for review in the Fifth \nCircuit instead.  See App., infra, 3a.  A panel of that court \nhad previously rejected an arbitrary-and-capricious \nchallenge to an FDA denial order in Wages & White \nLion Investments, L.L.C. v. FDA, 41 F.4th 427, 439 \n(2022), but by the time Reynolds filed its petitions for \nreview, the Fifth Circuit had vacated that decision and \n\n5 \n \ngranted rehearing en banc, see Wages & White Lion In-\nvestments, L.L.C. v. FDA, 58 F.4th 233 (2023).* \nEach of Reynolds\u2019 petitions for review was joined by \nthree other entities:  (1) RJR Vapor Co., LLC, a North \nCarolina company that sells Vuse products online; (2) \nAvail Vapor Texas, LLC (Avail), a Texas company that \noperates a retail store selling Vuse products; and (3) the \nMississippi Petroleum Marketers and Convenience \nStores Association (Convenience Stores Association), a \nMississippi association of gas stations and convenience \nstores, some of which sell Vuse products.  See Vibe C.A. \nDoc. 1-1, at 1-3; Solo C.A. Doc. 1-1, at 1-3; Alto C.A. Doc. \n1, at 1-4; RJR Vapor Co., LLC, Limited Liability Com-\npany Annual Report, 2023, at 1 (Jan. 30, 2023).  Reyn-\nolds and the other entities, respondents here, argued \nthat venue was proper because Avail and the Conven-\nience Stores Association were both based in the Fifth \nCircuit.  See Vibe C.A. Doc. 1, at 3; Solo C.A. Doc. 1, at \n3 Alto C.A. Doc. 1, at 3. \nb. In Vibe, respondents moved to stay FDA\u2019s denial \norder pending resolution of the petition for review.  See \nR.J. Reynolds Vapor Co. v. FDA, 65 F.4th 182, 188 (5th \nCir. 2023).  A motions panel granted the stay in a pub-\nlished opinion.  See id. at 189. \nThe Fifth Circuit first held that \u201cvenue is proper in \nthis circuit\u201d even though Reynolds neither resided nor \nhad its principal place of business there.  Reynolds, 65 \nF.4th at 188.  In the court\u2019s view, it was enough that \u201ca \n \n*  The en banc Fifth Circuit later ruled in favor of the e-cigarette \nmanufacturers on the arbitrary-and-capricious challenge.  See \nWages & White Lion Investments, L.L.C. v. FDA, 90 F.4th 357, 386 \n(2024).  FDA has sought certiorari to review that decision.  See FDA \nv. Wages & White Lion Investments, L.L.C., No. 23-1038 (filed Mar. \n19, 2024).  \n\n6 \n \npetitioner ha[d] its \u2018principal place of business\u2019\u200a\u201d in the \ncircuit.  Ibid. (emphasis added).  The court stated in an \naccompanying footnote that the Convenience Stores As-\nsociation \u201cis incorporated in and has its principal place \nof business in Mississippi.\u201d  Id. at 188 n.5. \nThe Fifth Circuit then determined that Reynolds \nwas likely to prevail on the merits of its arbitrary-and-\ncapricious challenge, see Reynolds, 65 F.4th at 189-194, \nand that the equities supported granting a stay, see id. \nat 194-195.  The court acknowledged that the Fourth \nand D.C. Circuit had rejected similar arbitrary-and- \ncapricious claims, but dismissed their decisions as \u201cun-\npersuasive.\u201d  Id. at 194 n.11. \nThe government filed a petition for rehearing en \nbanc, in which it specifically challenged the panel\u2019s rul-\ning on the venue issue.  See Vibe C.A. Doc. 145, at 21-25 \n(Apr. 7, 2023).  The Fifth Circuit denied that en banc \npetition.  See Vibe C.A. Doc. 312-1, at 1-2 (Feb. 6, 2024).  \nThe government also filed a motion to transfer the peti-\ntion for review to the D.C. Circuit, but the Fifth Circuit \ndenied that motion in an order without accompanying \nreasoning.  See Vibe C.A. Doc. 220-2, at 1-2 (June 27, \n2023). \nc. In Solo, the Fifth Circuit issued a similar order \ndenying the government\u2019s motion to transfer the peti-\ntion for review to the D.C. Circuit.  See Solo C.A. Doc. \n137-2, at 1-2 (June 27, 2023).  The court also issued an \norder granting respondents\u2019 motion for a stay of FDA\u2019s \ndenial order pending review.  See Solo C.A. Doc. 221-2, \nat 1-3 (Feb. 2, 2024).  \nd. Finally, in Alto, the government moved to dismiss \nthe petition for review or to transfer it to the D.C. Cir-\ncuit or Fourth Circuit.  See Alto C.A. Doc. 43, at 23 (Oct. \n\n7 \n \n18, 2023).  The Fifth Circuit denied the motion in an un-\npublished order.  See App, infra, 1a-8a. \nThe Fifth Circuit stated that it \u201cremain[ed] bound by \n[its] holding in the published opinion that venue is \nproper in this circuit\u201d and that \u201c[s]tare decisis governs \nvenue here.\u201d  App., infra, 4a.  The court also stated that, \nbecause the Tobacco Control Act allows \u201cany person ad-\nversely affected\u201d to challenge the denial of an applica-\ntion for marketing authorization, e-cigarette sellers \nmay \u201cchallenge FDA decisions that affect them.\u201d  Ibid. \n(citation and emphasis omitted). \nJudge Higginson dissented.  See App., infra, 6a-8a.  \nHe reasoned that the Fifth Circuit\u2019s interpretation of \nthe Act effectively nullified its venue limitations.  See \nid. at 6a-7a.  He also stated that the court\u2019s \u201cexpansive \nreading of venue cannot seem to be reconciled with \nother provisions of the [Act].\u201d  Id. at 7a. \nIn a separate order, the Fifth Circuit granted re-\nspondents\u2019 motion to stay FDA\u2019s denial order pending \nresolution of the petition for review.  See Alto C.A. Doc. \n133, at 1-3 (Feb. 2, 2024).  Judge Higginson dissented \nfrom that order as well.  See id. at 3 n.*. \nREASONS FOR GRANTING THE PETITION \nThe Tobacco Control Act provides for judicial review \nof an FDA order denying a manufacturer\u2019s application \nfor authorization to market a tobacco product, but only \nin the D.C. Circuit or the circuit where the party seek-\ning review resides or has its principal place of business.  \nSee 21 U.S.C. 387l(a)(1).  Any such review is limited to \na petition filed by a person \u201cadversely affected\u201d by the \norder, which the text and structure of the Act demon-\nstrate is limited to the person whose application for \nmarketing authorization was denied by FDA.  Yet in the \ndecision below, the Fifth Circuit held that an e-cigarette \n\n8 \n \nmanufacturer that neither resides nor maintains its \nprincipal place of business in that circuit may seek re-\nview there, so long as its petition for review is joined by \na local gas station or convenience store that sells its \nproducts.  Relying on that holding, other out-of-circuit \nmanufacturers have begun to file petitions for review in \nthe Fifth Circuit using the same tactic.  The Fifth Cir-\ncuit\u2019s decision permits retail sellers of a tobacco product \nwho have no right of judicial review under the Act to \nnevertheless gain review; effectively nullifies the Act\u2019s \nlimits on venue; facilitates blatant forum shopping; and \nundermines the precedents of other circuits.  This \nCourt should grant review and reverse the Fifth Cir-\ncuit\u2019s order in Alto denying the motion to dismiss or \ntransfer. \nA. The Decision Below Is Wrong \nThe Tobacco Control Act\u2019s judicial-review provision \nstates:  \n \nNot later than 30 days after\u2014 \n \n(A)  the promulgation of a regulation under [21 \nU.S.C. 387g] establishing, amending, or revoking \na tobacco product standard; or \n \n(B)  a denial of an application under [21 U.S.C. \n387j(c)], \nany person adversely affected by such regulation or \ndenial may file a petition for judicial review of such \nregulation or denial with the United States Court of \nAppeals for the District of Columbia or for the circuit \nin which such person resides or has their principal \nplace of business.  \n21 U.S.C. 387l(a)(1).  The Fifth Circuit has read that \nprovision to mean that an out-of-circuit manufacturer \n\n9 \n \nmay obtain judicial review of an FDA denial order in \nthat circuit, so long as its petition for review is joined by \na local seller of its products.  That reading is wrong on \nmultiple levels. \n1. To begin, the Fifth Circuit erred in holding that a \nretail seller of tobacco products has a statutory right to \nseek judicial review of an FDA order denying a manu-\nfacturer\u2019s application for marketing authorization for a \nnew tobacco product.  Under the Act, only the applicant \nmay challenge FDA\u2019s denial of its application.  \nThe Act provides that a \u201cperson adversely affected\u201d \nmay seek judicial review of a denial order.  21 U.S.C. \n387l(a)(1).  The term \u201c\u200a\u2018adversely affected,\u2019\u200a\u201d like its close \ncousin \u201c\u200a\u2018aggrieved,\u2019\u200a\u201d is a \u201cterm of art\u201d with \u201ca long his-\ntory in federal administrative law.\u201d  Director, Office of \nWorkers\u2019 Compensation Programs v. Newport News \nShipbuilding & Dry Dock Co., 514 U.S. 122, 126 (1995).  \nThis Court has read those and similar terms to mean \nthat a person may sue only if its interests \u201cfall within \nthe zone of interests protected by the law invoked.\u201d  \nLexmark International, Inc. v. Static Control Compo-\nnents, Inc., 572 U.S. 118, 129 (2014) (citation omitted); \nsee, e.g., Thompson v. North American Stainless, L.P., \n562 U.S. 170, 177-178 (2011).  The \u201cbreadth of the zone \nof interests\u201d depends on \u201cthe provisions of law at issue.\u201d  \nBennett v. Spear, 520 U.S. 154, 163 (1997).  As a result, \n\u201cwhat comes within the zone of interests of a statute for \npurposes of  * * *  the \u2018generous review provisions\u2019 of \nthe APA may not do so for other purposes.\u201d  Ibid. (cita-\ntion omitted).  Ultimately, discerning the scope of the \nzone of interests involves inferring \u201cthe probable legis-\nlative intent\u201d from the structure of \u201cthe statutory \nscheme.\u201d  Newport News, 514 U.S. at 127 (citation omit-\nted). \n\n10 \n \nThe structure of the statutory scheme here shows \nthat a seller of an applicant\u2019s products falls outside the \nzone of interests protected by the Act\u2014or, in other \nwords, that FDA\u2019s denial of a manufacturer\u2019s applica-\ntion for marketing authorization does not \u201cadversely af-\nfect\u201d such a seller within the meaning of the Act.  The \nAct provides that, when FDA denies an application, it \nmust serve its order \u201cto the applicant.\u201d  21 U.S.C. \n387j(e).  The Act does not require the agency to notify \nsellers or other members of the public of its decision.  \nJust the opposite:  \u201cthe intent to market a [new] tobacco \nproduct\u201d is \u201coften considered confidential commercial \ninformation,\u201d 86 Fed. Reg. 55,300, 55,398 (Oct. 5, 2021), \nand the Act requires FDA to protect the confidentiality \nof such information unless the manufacturer has pub-\nlicly revealed its intent to market the product, see 21 \nU.S.C. 387f(c). \nEven when the fact of an application or marketing \ndenial order is made public, the Act may preclude FDA \nfrom disclosing the contents of the application, order, \nand administrative record to sellers and other members \nof the public.  The Act provides that the \u201cinformation \nreported to or otherwise obtained by\u201d FDA as part of \nthe application process \u201cshall not be disclosed,\u201d except \nin limited circumstances.  21 U.S.C. 387f(c).  Indeed, \nReynolds has successfully moved to seal its filings in the \ncourt of appeals in order to protect \u201cconfidential and \nproprietary information concerning Vuse products\u2019 de-\nsign, components, construction, specifications, chemical \nmakeup, ingredients, and other highly sensitive tech-\nnical details that have not been made available to the \npublic.\u201d  Vibe C.A. Doc. 10, at 8 (Jan. 25, 2023).  Reyn-\nolds observed that \u201cFDA has repeatedly recognized the \nneed to prevent public disclosure of confidential and \n\n11 \n \nsensitive information contained in submission\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

L. No. 111-31, Div. A, 123 Stat. 1776, re-\nquires a person to obtain authorization from the Food \nand Drug Administration (FDA) before introducing a \nnew tobacco product into interstate commerce.  If FDA \ndenies an application for authorization, \u201cany person ad-\nversely affected by such  * * *  denial may file a petition \nfor judicial review of such  * * *  denial with the United \nStates Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia or \nfor the circuit in which such person resides or has their \nprincipal place of business.\u201d  21 U.S.C. 387l(a)(1).  The \nU.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit has deter-\nmined that a manufacturer may seek judicial review in \nthat circuit even if it neither resides nor has its principal \nplace of business there, so long as its petition is joined \nby a seller of its products, such as a gas station or con-\nvenience store, based in the circuit.  The question pre-\nsented is: \nWhether a manufacturer may file a petition for re-\nview in a circuit (other than the D.C. Circuit) where it \nneither resides nor has its principal place of business, if \nthe petition is joined by a seller of the manufacturer\u2019s \nproducts that is located within that circuit. \n \n \n\n \n(II) \nPARTIES TO THE PROCEEDING \nPetitioners (respondents below) are the Food and \nDrug Administration (FDA); Robert Califf, in his offi-\ncial capacity as Commissioner of FDA; the Department \nof Health and Human Services; and Xavier Becerra, in \nhis official capacity as Secretary of Health and Human \nServices.

REYNOLDS VAPOR CO., ET AL. \n \nON PETITION FOR A WRIT OF CERTIORARI \nTO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS \nFOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT \n \nPETITION FOR A WRIT OF CERTIORARI \n \nThe Solicitor General, on behalf of the petitioners, \nrespectfully petitions for a writ of certiorari to review \nthe order of the United States Court of Appeals for the \nFifth Circuit in this case. \nOPINIONS BELOW \nThe order of the court of appeals (App., infra, 1a-8a) \nis unreported. \nJURISDICTION \nThe order of the court of appeals was entered on \nFebruary 2, 2024.  The jurisdiction of this Court is in-\nvoked under 28 U.S.C. 1254(1). \nSTATUTORY PROVISION INVOLVED \nThe pertinent statutory provision is reproduced in \nthe appendix.  App., infra, 24a. \n\n2 \n \nSTATEMENT \n1. In 2009, Congress enacted the Family Smoking \nPrevention and Tobacco Control Act (Tobacco Control \nAct or Act), Pub. L. No. 111-31, Div. A, 123 Stat. 1776.  \nThe Act imposes special restrictions on the marketing \nof \u201c\u200a\u2018new tobacco products\u2019\u200a\u201d\u2014that is, tobacco products \nthat were not commercially marketed in the United \nStates as of February 15, 2007.  21 U.S.C. 387j(a)(1).  A \nmanufacturer may introduce a new tobacco product into \ninterstate commerce only if it obtains authorization \nfrom the Secretary of Health and Human Services.  See \n21 U.S.C. 387j(c)(2)(A).  The Secretary exercises that \nauthority through the Food and Drug Administration \n(FDA).  See 21 U.S.C. 393(d)(2). \nThe Act provides that \u201cany person adversely af-\nfected\u201d by the \u201cdenial of an application\u201d for marketing \nauthorization \u201cmay file a petition for judicial review\u201d \nwithin 30 days after the denial.  21 U.S.C. 387l(a)(1)(B).  \nThe petition must be filed \u201cwith the United States Court \nof Appeals for the District of Columbia or for the circuit \nin which such person resides or has their principal place \nof business.\u201d  21 U.S.C. 387l(a)(1).  The court must re-\nview the agency action in accordance with the judicial-\nreview provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act \n(APA), 5 U.S.C. 701 et seq.  See 21 U.S.C. 387l(b). \nIn 2016, FDA promulgated a rule announcing that it \nwould regulate electronic nicotine delivery systems, \nmore commonly known as e-cigarettes or vapes, in ac-\ncordance with the Act.  See Deeming Tobacco Products \nTo Be Subject to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic \nAct, as Amended by the Family Smoking Prevention \nand Tobacco Control Act; Restrictions on the Sale and \nDistribution of Tobacco Products and Required Warn-\ning Statements for Tobacco Products; Final Rule, 81 \n\n3 \n \nFed. Reg. 28,974, 29,028-29,044 (May 10, 2016).  An  \ne-cigarette is a battery-powered device that heats a liq-\nuid containing nicotine and other substances, convert-\ning the liquid into an aerosol (a suspension of small air-\nborne droplets) that the user inhales.  See Centers for \nDisease Control and Prevention (CDC), U.S. Dep\u2019t of \nHealth and Human Services, E-Cigarette, or Vaping, \nProducts Visual Dictionary 7.  E-cigarettes generally \nqualify as \u201cnew tobacco products\u201d because they were \nnot on the market as of February 15, 2007.  See Avail \nVapor, LLC v. FDA, 55 F.4th 409, 414 (4th Cir. 2022), \ncert. denied, 144 S. Ct. 277 (2023).   \n2. Respondent R.J. Reynolds Vapor Co. (Reynolds) \nmanufactures e-cigarette products under the brand \nname Vuse.  See App., infra, 13a.  Reynolds is incorpo-\nrated, and thus resides, in North Carolina, and it main-\ntains its principal place of business in Winston-Salem, \nNorth Carolina.  See R.J. Reynolds Vapor Co., Busi-\nness Corporation Annual Report, F.Y. 2022, at 1 (Jan. \n30, 2023).   \nReynolds applied for authorization to market three \nsets of flavored e-cigarette products:  Vuse Vibe, Vuse \nSolo, and Vuse Alto.  We refer to the Fifth Circuit case \nconcerning Vuse Vibe (No. 23-60037) as Vibe, the case \nconcerning Vuse Solo (No. 23-60128) as Solo, and the \ncase concerning Vuse Alto (No. 23-60545) as Alto.  This \npetition for a writ of certiorari seeks review of an order \nissued in Alto, but we describe the proceedings in all \nthree cases because they provide relevant context.   \nFDA denied all three sets of applications.  See Vibe \nC.A. Pet. for Review, Ex. A at 1-4 (Jan. 24, 2023); Solo \nC.A. Pet. for Review, Ex. A 1-4 (Mar. 17, 2023); App., \ninfra, 9a-23a.  The Act permits FDA to grant marketing \nauthorization only if the manufacturer shows that the \n\n4 \n \nmarketing of the product is \u201cappropriate for the protec-\ntion of the public health.\u201d  21 U.S.C. 387j(a)(2)(A).  FDA \nfound that Reynolds had failed to make that showing.  \nSee Vibe C.A. Pet. for Review, Ex. A at 1; Solo C.A. Pet. \nfor Review, Ex. A at 1; App., infra, 9a-10a.  \n3. Reynolds filed three petitions for review, which \nthe court of appeals later consolidated.  See Vibe C.A. \nDoc. 231 (Oct. 19, 2023). \na. Under the Act, Reynolds could have filed a peti-\ntion for review in either the Fourth Circuit (where it is \nbased) or the D.C. Circuit.  See App., infra, 7a (Hig-\nginson, J., dissenting).  But \u201c[t]hose two courts ha[d] al-\nready ruled on questions central to these cases in a man-\nner that is adverse to Reynolds\u2019 position.\u201d  Ibid.  In par-\nticular, Reynolds claims that FDA acted arbitrarily and \ncapriciously by, among other things, changing the evi-\ndentiary standards for flavored e-cigarette products af-\nter manufacturers had submitted their applications.  \nSee Vibe C.A. Doc. 62, at 12-18 (Feb. 8, 2023).  The \nFourth and D.C. Circuits had previously rejected simi-\nlar claims.  See Avail Vapor, 55 F.4th at 422 (4th Cir.); \nProhibition Juice Co. v. FDA, 45 F.4th 8, 21 (D.C. Cir. \n2022). \nReynolds filed its petitions for review in the Fifth \nCircuit instead.  See App., infra, 3a.  A panel of that court \nhad previously rejected an arbitrary-and-capricious \nchallenge to an FDA denial order in Wages & White \nLion Investments, L.L.C. v. FDA, 41 F.4th 427, 439 \n(2022), but by the time Reynolds filed its petitions for \nreview, the Fifth Circuit had vacated that decision and \n\n5 \n \ngranted rehearing en banc, see Wages & White Lion In-\nvestments, L.L.C. v. FDA, 58 F.4th 233 (2023).* \nEach of Reynolds\u2019 petitions for review was joined by \nthree other entities:  (1) RJR Vapor Co., LLC, a North \nCarolina company that sells Vuse products online; (2) \nAvail Vapor Texas, LLC (Avail), a Texas company that \noperates a retail store selling Vuse products; and (3) the \nMississippi Petroleum Marketers and Convenience \nStores Association (Convenience Stores Association), a \nMississippi association of gas stations and convenience \nstores, some of which sell Vuse products.  See Vibe C.A. \nDoc. 1-1, at 1-3; Solo C.A. Doc. 1-1, at 1-3; Alto C.A. Doc. \n1, at 1-4; RJR Vapor Co., LLC, Limited Liability Com-\npany Annual Report, 2023, at 1 (Jan. 30, 2023).  Reyn-\nolds and the other entities, respondents here, argued \nthat venue was proper because Avail and the Conven-\nience Stores Association were both based in the Fifth \nCircuit.  See Vibe C.A. Doc. 1, at 3; Solo C.A. Doc. 1, at \n3 Alto C.A. Doc. 1, at 3. \nb. In Vibe, respondents moved to stay FDA\u2019s denial \norder pending resolution of the petition for review.  See \nR.J. Reynolds Vapor Co. v. FDA, 65 F.4th 182, 188 (5th \nCir. 2023).  A motions panel granted the stay in a pub-\nlished opinion.  See id. at 189. \nThe Fifth Circuit first held that \u201cvenue is proper in \nthis circuit\u201d even though Reynolds neither resided nor \nhad its principal place of business there.  Reynolds, 65 \nF.4th at 188.  In the court\u2019s view, it was enough that \u201ca \n \n*  The en banc Fifth Circuit later ruled in favor of the e-cigarette \nmanufacturers on the arbitrary-and-capricious challenge.  See \nWages & White Lion Investments, L.L.C. v. FDA, 90 F.4th 357, 386 \n(2024).  FDA has sought certiorari to review that decision.  See FDA \nv. Wages & White Lion Investments, L.L.C., No. 23-1038 (filed Mar. \n19, 2024).  \n\n6 \n \npetitioner ha[d] its \u2018principal place of business\u2019\u200a\u201d in the \ncircuit.  Ibid. (emphasis added).  The court stated in an \naccompanying footnote that the Convenience Stores As-\nsociation \u201cis incorporated in and has its principal place \nof business in Mississippi.\u201d  Id. at 188 n.5. \nThe Fifth Circuit then determined that Reynolds \nwas likely to prevail on the merits of its arbitrary-and-\ncapricious challenge, see Reynolds, 65 F.4th at 189-194, \nand that the equities supported granting a stay, see id. \nat 194-195.  The court acknowledged that the Fourth \nand D.C. Circuit had rejected similar arbitrary-and- \ncapricious claims, but dismissed their decisions as \u201cun-\npersuasive.\u201d  Id. at 194 n.11. \nThe government filed a petition for rehearing en \nbanc, in which it specifically challenged the panel\u2019s rul-\ning on the venue issue.  See Vibe C.A. Doc. 145, at 21-25 \n(Apr. 7, 2023).  The Fifth Circuit denied that en banc \npetition.  See Vibe C.A. Doc. 312-1, at 1-2 (Feb. 6, 2024).  \nThe government also filed a motion to transfer the peti-\ntion for review to the D.C. Circuit, but the Fifth Circuit \ndenied that motion in an order without accompanying \nreasoning.  See Vibe C.A. Doc. 220-2, at 1-2 (June 27, \n2023). \nc. In Solo, the Fifth Circuit issued a similar order \ndenying the government\u2019s motion to transfer the peti-\ntion for review to the D.C. Circuit.  See Solo C.A. Doc. \n137-2, at 1-2 (June 27, 2023).  The court also issued an \norder granting respondents\u2019 motion for a stay of FDA\u2019s \ndenial order pending review.  See Solo C.A. Doc. 221-2, \nat 1-3 (Feb. 2, 2024).  \nd. Finally, in Alto, the government moved to dismiss \nthe petition for review or to transfer it to the D.C. Cir-\ncuit or Fourth Circuit.  See Alto C.A. Doc. 43, at 23 (Oct. \n\n7 \n \n18, 2023).  The Fifth Circuit denied the motion in an un-\npublished order.  See App, infra, 1a-8a. \nThe Fifth Circuit stated that it \u201cremain[ed] bound by \n[its] holding in the published opinion that venue is \nproper in this circuit\u201d and that \u201c[s]tare decisis governs \nvenue here.\u201d  App., infra, 4a.  The court also stated that, \nbecause the Tobacco Control Act allows \u201cany person ad-\nversely affected\u201d to challenge the denial of an applica-\ntion for marketing authorization, e-cigarette sellers \nmay \u201cchallenge FDA decisions that affect them.\u201d  Ibid. \n(citation and emphasis omitted). \nJudge Higginson dissented.  See App., infra, 6a-8a.  \nHe reasoned that the Fifth Circuit\u2019s interpretation of \nthe Act effectively nullified its venue limitations.  See \nid. at 6a-7a.  He also stated that the court\u2019s \u201cexpansive \nreading of venue cannot seem to be reconciled with \nother provisions of the [Act].\u201d  Id. at 7a. \nIn a separate order, the Fifth Circuit granted re-\nspondents\u2019 motion to stay FDA\u2019s denial order pending \nresolution of the petition for review.  See Alto C.A. Doc. \n133, at 1-3 (Feb. 2, 2024).  Judge Higginson dissented \nfrom that order as well.  See id. at 3 n.*. \nREASONS FOR GRANTING THE PETITION \nThe Tobacco Control Act provides for judicial review \nof an FDA order denying a manufacturer\u2019s application \nfor authorization to market a tobacco product, but only \nin the D.C. Circuit or the circuit where the party seek-\ning review resides or has its principal place of business.  \nSee 21 U.S.C. 387l(a)(1).  Any such review is limited to \na petition filed by a person \u201cadversely affected\u201d by the \norder, which the text and structure of the Act demon-\nstrate is limited to the person whose application for \nmarketing authorization was denied by FDA.  Yet in the \ndecision below, the Fifth Circuit held that an e-cigarette \n\n8 \n \nmanufacturer that neither resides nor maintains its \nprincipal place of business in that circuit may seek re-\nview there, so long as its petition for review is joined by \na local gas station or convenience store that sells its \nproducts.  Relying on that holding, other out-of-circuit \nmanufacturers have begun to file petitions for review in \nthe Fifth Circuit using the same tactic.  The Fifth Cir-\ncuit\u2019s decision permits retail sellers of a tobacco product \nwho have no right of judicial review under the Act to \nnevertheless gain review; effectively nullifies the Act\u2019s \nlimits on venue; facilitates blatant forum shopping; and \nundermines the precedents of other circuits.  This \nCourt should grant review and reverse the Fifth Cir-\ncuit\u2019s order in Alto denying the motion to dismiss or \ntransfer. \nA. The Decision Below Is Wrong \nThe Tobacco Control Act\u2019s judicial-review provision \nstates:  \n \nNot later than 30 days after\u2014 \n \n(A)  the promulgation of a regulation under [21 \nU.S.C. 387g] establishing, amending, or revoking \na tobacco product standard; or \n \n(B)  a denial of an application under [21 U.S.C. \n387j(c)], \nany person adversely affected by such regulation or \ndenial may file a petition for judicial review of such \nregulation or denial with the United States Court of \nAppeals for the District of Columbia or for the circuit \nin which such person resides or has their principal \nplace of business.  \n21 U.S.C. 387l(a)(1).  The Fifth Circuit has read that \nprovision to mean that an out-of-circuit manufacturer \n\n9 \n \nmay obtain judicial review of an FDA denial order in \nthat circuit, so long as its petition for review is joined by \na local seller of its products.  That reading is wrong on \nmultiple levels. \n1. To begin, the Fifth Circuit erred in holding that a \nretail seller of tobacco products has a statutory right to \nseek judicial review of an FDA order denying a manu-\nfacturer\u2019s application for marketing authorization for a \nnew tobacco product.  Under the Act, only the applicant \nmay challenge FDA\u2019s denial of its application.  \nThe Act provides that a \u201cperson adversely affected\u201d \nmay seek judicial review of a denial order.  21 U.S.C. \n387l(a)(1).  The term \u201c\u200a\u2018adversely affected,\u2019\u200a\u201d like its close \ncousin \u201c\u200a\u2018aggrieved,\u2019\u200a\u201d is a \u201cterm of art\u201d with \u201ca long his-\ntory in federal administrative law.\u201d  Director, Office of \nWorkers\u2019 Compensation Programs v. Newport News \nShipbuilding & Dry Dock Co., 514 U.S. 122, 126 (1995).  \nThis Court has read those and similar terms to mean \nthat a person may sue only if its interests \u201cfall within \nthe zone of interests protected by the law invoked.\u201d  \nLexmark International, Inc. v. Static Control Compo-\nnents, Inc., 572 U.S. 118, 129 (2014) (citation omitted); \nsee, e.g., Thompson v. North American Stainless, L.P., \n562 U.S. 170, 177-178 (2011).  The \u201cbreadth of the zone \nof interests\u201d depends on \u201cthe provisions of law at issue.\u201d  \nBennett v. Spear, 520 U.S. 154, 163 (1997).  As a result, \n\u201cwhat comes within the zone of interests of a statute for \npurposes of  * * *  the \u2018generous review provisions\u2019 of \nthe APA may not do so for other purposes.\u201d  Ibid. (cita-\ntion omitted).  Ultimately, discerning the scope of the \nzone of interests involves inferring \u201cthe probable legis-\nlative intent\u201d from the structure of \u201cthe statutory \nscheme.\u201d  Newport News, 514 U.S. at 127 (citation omit-\nted). \n\n10 \n \nThe structure of the statutory scheme here shows \nthat a seller of an applicant\u2019s products falls outside the \nzone of interests protected by the Act\u2014or, in other \nwords, that FDA\u2019s denial of a manufacturer\u2019s applica-\ntion for marketing authorization does not \u201cadversely af-\nfect\u201d such a seller within the meaning of the Act.  The \nAct provides that, when FDA denies an application, it \nmust serve its order \u201cto the applicant.\u201d  21 U.S.C. \n387j(e).  The Act does not require the agency to notify \nsellers or other members of the public of its decision.  \nJust the opposite:  \u201cthe intent to market a [new] tobacco \nproduct\u201d is \u201coften considered confidential commercial \ninformation,\u201d 86 Fed. Reg. 55,300, 55,398 (Oct. 5, 2021), \nand the Act requires FDA to protect the confidentiality \nof such information unless the manufacturer has pub-\nlicly revealed its intent to market the product, see 21 \nU.S.C. 387f(c). \nEven when the fact of an application or marketing \ndenial order is made public, the Act may preclude FDA \nfrom disclosing the contents of the application, order, \nand administrative record to sellers and other members \nof the public.  The Act provides that the \u201cinformation \nreported to or otherwise obtained by\u201d FDA as part of \nthe application process \u201cshall not be disclosed,\u201d except \nin limited circumstances.  21 U.S.C. 387f(c).  Indeed, \nReynolds has successfully moved to seal its filings in the \ncourt of appeals in order to protect \u201cconfidential and \nproprietary information concerning Vuse products\u2019 de-\nsign, components, construction, specifications, chemical \nmakeup, ingredients, and other highly sensitive tech-\nnical details that have not been made available to the \npublic.\u201d  Vibe C.A. Doc. 10, at 8 (Jan. 25, 2023).  Reyn-\nolds observed that \u201cFDA has repeatedly recognized the \nneed to prevent public disclosure of confidential and \n\n11 \n \nsensitive information contained in submissions like the \nVuse applications.\u201d  Ibid. \nThose aspects of the statutory structure demon-\nstrate that the denial of a manufacturer\u2019s application \ndoes not adversely affect a seller of its products within \nthe meaning of the Act.  It is implausible that Congress \nsimultaneously granted sellers, whose interests are en-\ntirely derivative of those of the applicant, the right to \nchallenge denial orders\u2014yet denied the sellers notice of \nthe orders and access to the information underlying the \norders.   \nIn addition, the Act forbids the sale of new tobacco \nproducts unless and until FDA authorizes it.  See 21 \nU.S.C. 387j(a)(2)(A).  The harm that Avail and the Con-\nvenience Stores Association assert here\u2014lost sales of \nproducts that the Act prohibited them from selling in \nthe first place\u2014does not qualify as an \u201cadverse effect\u201d \nin the sense meant by Congress. \nIn ruling otherwise, the Fifth Circuit emphasized \nthat an FDA marketing denial order \u201caffect[s]\u201d a seller \nby reducing its sales.  App., infra, 4a.  As explained \nabove, however, the phrase \u201cadversely affected\u201d is a \nterm of art in administrative law.  See p. 9, supra.  The \ncritical question is not whether a denial order harms the \nseller in some way; it is whether that harm \u201cconstitutes \nadverse effect\u201d within the meaning of the Act.  Newport \nNews, 514 U.S. at 126 (emphasis omitted).  For the rea-\nsons given above, the Act\u2019s structure shows that it does \nnot.   \nThe Fifth Circuit also contrasted the judicial-review \nprovision at issue here with a separate provision that \npermits only the \u201cholder of an application\u201d to challenge \nFDA\u2019s withdrawal of marking authorization that was \npreviously granted.  21 U.S.C. 387j(d)(2); see App., in-\n\n12 \n \nfra, 4a.  But the court read too much into that difference \nin wording.  The provision for judicial review that re-\nspondents invoked here authorizes judicial review not \nonly of a \u201cdenial\u201d of an application, but also of a \u201cregu-\nlation\u201d establishing, amending, or revoking a tobacco \nproduct standard.  21 U.S.C. 387l(a)(1).  The phrase \n\u201cholder of an application,\u201d used in the narrower provi-\nsion specifically addressing judicial review only of with-\ndrawal orders, would have been a poor fit for the full \nrange of agency actions covered by the provision here.   \nIf anything, the provision concerning review of with-\ndrawal orders cuts against the Fifth Circuit\u2019s reading.  \nAs Judge Higginson explained, withdrawal orders, \nwhich require retailers to stop previously lawful sales, \naffect retailers\u2019 interests far more directly than denial \norders.  See App., infra, 7a (Higginson, J., dissenting).  \nThe Fifth Circuit did not explain why Congress would \nhave wanted to allow retailers to challenge the denial of \nauthorization to market a new tobacco product at the \noutset, but to allow only the applicant to challenge the \nwithdrawal of marketing authorization that was previ-\nously granted. \n2. The Fifth Circuit further erred by holding that \nReynolds may file a petition for review in that circuit \nbecause \u201ctwo [other] Petitioners,\u201d Avail and the Con-\nvenience Stores Association, are based in the Fifth Cir-\ncuit.  See App., infra, 3a; see R.J. Reynolds Vapor Co. \nv. FDA, 65 F.4th 182, 188 (5th Cir. 2023) (\u201c[\u200aV]enue is \nproper in this circuit because a petitioner has its \u2018prin-\ncipal place of business\u2019 here.\u201d) (emphasis added).  Venue \nunder the Act is party-specific; a petitioner as to whom \nvenue is improper may not tag along with a different \npetitioner as to whom it is proper. \n\n13 \n \nThe Act provides that a \u201cperson\u201d may seek judicial \nreview in the D.C. Circuit or the circuit where \u201csuch \nperson\u201d resides or has its principal place of business.  21 \nU.S.C. 387l(a)(1) (emphasis added).  That statutory text \nplainly directs that a person\u2019s right to seek review in a \ncircuit depends on that person\u2019s residence or principal \nplace of business.  Nothing in the text suggests that one \nperson may file a petition for review in a circuit (other \nthan the D.C. Circuit) where it neither resides nor has \nits principal place of business, so long as its petition is \njoined by a different person that is based there. \nPrecedent confirms that reading.  \u201cFaced with multi-\nparty cases, [this] Court long ago held that venue must \nbe proper as to each party.\u201d  14D Charles Alan Wright \net al., Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 3807 (4th ed. \n2023).  Interpreting a provision authorizing venue in the \ndistrict where \u201cthe plaintiff\u200a\u201d resided, the Court found \nvenue improper as to a co-plaintiff from a different dis-\ntrict.  Smith v. Lyon, 133 U.S. 315, 317 (1890); see id. at \n317-320.  Similarly, interpreting a provision authorizing \nvenue in the district where \u201cthe defendant\u201d resided, the \nCourt found venue improper as to a co-defendant from \na different district.  Camp v. Gress, 250 U.S. 308, 311 \n(1919); see id. at 311-316.  Of course, Congress could \nadopt a different approach in a particular venue statute, \nsay by authorizing venue in a district where \u201cany de-\nfendant resides.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 1391(g) (emphasis added).  \nBut nothing in the text or context of the special judicial-\nreview provision in the Tobacco Control Act suggests \nthat Congress departed from the traditional rule that \n\u201ceach plaintiff must be competent to sue\u201d and \u201ceach de-\nfendant must be liable to be sued\u201d in the chosen venue.  \nSmith, 133 U.S. at 319 (citation omitted). \n\n14 \n \nThe Fifth Circuit\u2019s contrary rulings conflict with the \nTenth Circuit\u2019s decision in Amerada Petroleum Corp. v. \nFederal Power Commission, 338 F.2d 808 (1964).  That \ncase arose under the Natural Gas Act, 15 U.S.C. 717  \net seq., which authorizes a natural-gas company to file a \npetition for review \u201cin the court of appeals of the United \nStates for any circuit wherein the natural-gas company \nto which the order relates is located or has its principal \nplace of business, or in the United States Court of Ap-\npeals for the District of Columbia.\u201d  15 U.S.C. 717r(b).  \nThe Tenth Circuit read that provision to mean that out-\nof-circuit companies could not join a local company to \nseek review in that circuit.  See Amerada Petroleum, \n338 F.2d at 809-810.  Yet the Fifth Circuit has approved \nexactly that maneuver under the materially similar \nvenue provision here. \n3. The Fifth Circuit\u2019s decisions additionally contra-\ndict elementary principles of statutory interpretation.  \nThis Court ordinarily reads statutes \u201cso that effect is \ngiven to all provisions, so that no part will be inopera-\ntive or superfluous, void or insignificant.\u201d  Ysleta del \nSur Pueblo v. Texas, 596 U.S. 685, 698-699 (2022) (cita-\ntion omitted).  The Court also ordinarily avoids readings \nthat facilitate ready \u201cevasion of the law,\u201d County of \nMaui v. Hawaii Wildlife Fund, 140 S. Ct. 1462, 1473 \n(2020) (citation omitted), or that enable parties to \n\u201celude its provisions in the most easy manner,\u201d The \nEmily, 9 Wheat. 381, 389 (1824).  And the Court has re-\njected readings of venue statutes that would \u201cencourage \ngamesmanship\u201d or \u201c\u200a\u2018create or multiply opportunities \nfor forum shopping.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Atlantic Marine Construction \nCo. v. United States District Court, 571 U.S. 49, 65 \n(2013) (citation omitted). \n\n15 \n \nContrary to those principles, the Fifth Circuit\u2019s in-\nterpretation nullifies the Act\u2019s venue restrictions, facil-\nitates their ready circumvention, and encourages forum \nshopping.  The Act provides that a person may file a pe-\ntition for review in the circuit where it \u201cresides\u201d or has \nits \u201cprincipal place of business.\u201d  21 U.S.C. 387l(a)(1).  \nYet under the decision below, an applicant may file a \npetition for review in a circuit where it neither resides \nnor maintains its principal place of business so long as \nit recruits a local gas station or convenience store to join \nits petition.  The Act also designates the D.C. Circuit as \nthe one circuit where any applicant may seek judicial \nreview regardless of the applicant\u2019s location.  See ibid.  \nYet under the decision below, an applicant may also \nseek judicial review in the Fifth Circuit through the \nsimple expedient of finding a local retailer to join it.   \nB. The Question Presented Warrants This Court\u2019s Review \n1. The Fifth Circuit initially answered the question \npresented here in its Vibe stay order.  But the court did \nnot just hold that venue was likely proper in the course \nof analyzing likelihood of success on the merits; rather, \nit held, in a published opinion, that \u201cvenue is proper in \nthis circuit.\u201d  Reynolds, 65 F.4th at 188 (emphasis \nadded). The government filed a petition for rehearing \nen banc, but the Fifth Circuit denied that petition.  See \np. 6, supra.   \nThe Fifth Circuit\u2019s later decisions confirm that the \ncourt regards the venue issue as settled.  The govern-\nment moved to transfer the petitions for review in Vibe \nand Solo, but the Fifth Circuit denied those motions.  \nSee p. 6, supra.  The government also moved to dismiss \nor transfer in Alto, but the Fifth Circuit denied that mo-\ntion as well.  App., infra, 2a-5a.  The court stated that \n\u201c[s]tare decisis governs venue\u201d and that it remained \n\n16 \n \n\u201cbound by [its] holding in the published opinion that \nvenue is proper.\u201d  Id. at 4a.  Thus, unless this Court \ngrants review and reverses, out-of-circuit manufactur-\ners will be able to seek review in the Fifth Circuit and \nto circumvent unfavorable precedent in the D.C. Circuit \nand their own circuits. \n2. The effects of the Fifth Circuit\u2019s interpretation of \nthe Act extend beyond this case.  Reynolds alone has \nfiled three petitions for review in the Fifth Circuit.  See \np. 4, supra.  On each occasion, Reynolds raised claims \nthat would have been foreclosed, at least in part, by \nprecedent in the D.C. Circuit and the Fourth Circuit, \nthe two circuits in which judicial review of the denials of \nits applications would have been available under the \nAct.  See ibid.  Each time, Reynolds circumvented that \nadverse precedent by enlisting local retailers\u2014a Texas \nconvenience store and a Mississippi trade association\u2014\nto join its petition.  See p. 5, supra.  And each time, the \nFifth Circuit rejected the government\u2019s venue objection \nand stayed FDA\u2019s denial order.  See pp. 5-7, supra. \nOther out-of-circuit manufacturers have begun using \nthe same tactic to obtain judicial review of FDA orders \nin the Fifth Circuit.  For example, Fontem US, LLC, a \nmanufacturer based in North Carolina, has filed a peti-\ntion for review joined by a company that operates con-\nvenience stores in Mississippi and Louisiana\u2014and has \nobtained a temporary stay from the Fifth Circuit.  See \nPet. for Review at 1-3, Corr-Williams Co. v. FDA, No. \n24-60068 (Feb. 8, 2024); C.A. Doc. 82-2, at 1-2, Corr- \nWilliams, supra (No. 24-60068) (Mar. 7, 2024).  Shen-\nzhen Youme Information Technology Co., a manufac-\nturer based in Shenzhen, China, has filed a petition \njoined by a Texas retailer.  See Pet. for Review at 1-3, \nShenzhen Youme Information Technology Co. v. FDA, \n\n17 \n \nNo. 24-60060 (5th Cir. Feb. 5, 2024).  And Shenzhen \nIVPS Technology Co., a different manufacturer based \nin Shenzhen, China, has filed a petition joined by a \nTexas distributor.  See Pet. for Review at 1-3, Shenzhen \nIVPS Technology Co. v. FDA, No. 24-60032 (5th Cir. \nJan. 19, 2024).   \n3. This Court should grant review to put a stop to \nthat practice.  The Court\u2019s functions include \u201csupervis-\ning the administration of the judicial system.\u201d  Hol-\nlingsworth v. Perry, 558 U.S. 183, 196 (2010) (per cu-\nriam).  Fulfilling that role, the Court recently granted \ncertiorari to correct a venue ruling that had led to ram-\npant forum-shopping in patent cases.  See TC Heart-\nland LLC v. Kraft Foods Group Brands LLC, 581 U.S. \n258, 263 (2017).  The Court should grant review here for \nsimilar reasons. \nAlthough the Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision does not create \na circuit conflict specifically about the meaning of the \nTobacco Control Act\u2019s venue provision, it does conflict \nwith the Tenth Circuit\u2019s decision in Amerada Petro-\nleum interpreting a materially similar venue provision.  \nSee p. 14, supra.  In addition, the Fifth Circuit\u2019s inter-\npretation of the Act undermines the authority of other \ncourts of appeals in a manner that warrants this Court\u2019s \nintervention.  The Fifth Circuit has repeatedly en-\ncroached on the domains of other circuits by hearing \n(and granting stays in) cases under the Tobacco Control \nAct that belong elsewhere.  And the Fifth Circuit has \nrepeatedly undermined the precedents of other circuits \nby enabling out-of-circuit manufacturers to evade those \nprecedents.  Because manufacturers across the country \ncan now file petitions for review in the Fifth Circuit, \nmoreover, it is unlikely that the question presented will \n\n18 \n \npercolate in other courts of appeals or that a circuit con-\nflict about that question will ever develop. \nThe Fifth Circuit\u2019s decisions also have had serious \nconsequences for public health.  As discussed above, the \nFifth Circuit has repeatedly stayed FDA denial orders \nat the behest of out-of-circuit manufacturers.  See pp. 4-\n7, 16, supra.  Relying on those stays, manufacturers and \nsellers have continued selling e-cigarette products that \nFDA has never authorized.  Those sales\u2014which have \noccurred throughout the Nation, not just in the Fifth \nCircuit\u2014contribute to a \u201cyouth vaping epidemic.\u201d  \nAvail Vapor, LLC v. FDA, 55 F.4th 409, 426 (4th Cir. \n2022), cert. denied, 144 S. Ct. 277 (2023).  One study es-\ntimated that, in 2023, 420,000 middle- and high-school \nstudents used Reynolds\u2019 Vuse e-cigarette products.  See \nJan Birdsey et al., CDC, U.S. Dep\u2019t of Health and Hu-\nman Services, Tobacco Product Use Among U.S. Mid-\ndle and High School Students\u2014National Youth To-\nbacco Survey, 2023, 72 Morbidity and Mortality Weekly \nReport 1180 (Nov. 3, 2023).  According to estimates in \nthe same study, 230,000 students used Shenzhen IVPS\u2019s \n\u201cSMOK\u201d brand e-cigarettes, 120,000 students used \nFontem\u2019s \u201cblu\u201d brand e-cigarettes, and 70,000 students \nused Shenzhen Youme\u2019s \u201cSuorin\u201d brand e-cigarettes.  \nIbid.  Those substantial practical consequences under-\nscore the need for this Court\u2019s review. \nThe underlying merits issues in this case, which con-\ncern FDA\u2019s consideration of flavored e-cigarette prod-\nucts, overlap with the issues raised by FDA\u2019s pending \npetition for a writ of certiorari in FDA v. Wages & White \nLion Investments, L.L.C., No. 23-1038 (filed Mar. 19, \n2024).  But the threshold venue issue will remain im-\nportant no matter how this Court resolves Wages.  The \njudicial-review provision involved here applies to any \n\n19 \n \norder denying authorization to market any new tobacco \nproduct.  And out-of-circuit manufacturers have begun \nfiling petitions for review in the Fifth Circuit even in \ncases that raise legal issues on the merits that are dis-\ntinct from the one in Wages.  See Pet. for Review, Ex. A \nat 6, Shenzhen Youme, supra (No. 24-60060) (denial of \nauthorization to market an e-cigarette device that can \nbe filled with liquids of the user\u2019s choice); Pet. for Re-\nview, Ex. A at 9-13, Shenzhen IVPS, supra (No. 24-\n60032) (same). \n4. This Court should grant review even though the \nFifth Circuit\u2019s order denying the motion to dismiss or \ntransfer in Alto is interlocutory.  It is well settled that \n\u201cinterlocutory orders of federal courts of appeals are re-\nviewable on certiorari.\u201d  Stephen M. Shapiro et al., Su-\npreme Court Practice \u00a7 17.7, at 17-17 (2019); see id.  \n\u00a7 4.18, at 4-54 to 4-55 (collecting cases).  In particular, a \nparty may seek certiorari from a court of appeals\u2019 order \ndenying a motion to dismiss a petition for review.  See \nNational Ass\u2019n of Manufacturers v. Department of De-\nfense, 583 U.S. 109, 120 (2018).   \nTo be sure, this Court generally denies petitions at \nan interlocutory stage of a case because litigants remain \nfree to seek relief after final judgment.  See, e.g., City \nof Ocala v. Rojas, 143 S. Ct. 764, 765 (2023) (statement \nof Gorsuch, J., respecting the denial of certiorari).  But \nthat practice is not categorical.  In particular, the Court \nhas on many occasions granted petitions raising venue \nissues at an interlocutory stage of a case.  See, e.g., TC \nHeartland, 581 U.S. at 263; Walden v. Fore, 571 U.S. \n277, 282 & n.5 (2014); Atlantic Marine, 571 U.S. at 54-\n55.  Alto remains pending in the court of appeals follow-\ning the denial of the government\u2019s motion to dismiss or \ntransfer, and thus no final judgment on the merits has \n\n20 \n \nbeen entered there.  But as noted above, the Court \ngranted certiorari in National Association of Manufac-\nturers in a similar posture. \nIn addition, in Mercantile National Bank v. Lang-\ndeau, 371 U.S. 555 (1963), the Court held that a state \nsupreme court\u2019s denial of a motion to transfer a case \nfrom one state court to another, as assertedly required \nby a federal statute governing suits against national \nbanks, constituted a \u201cfinal\u201d judgment for purposes of \nthe Court\u2019s jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. 1257.  See 371 \nU.S. at 557-558.  Here, as there, postponing review of \nthe question presented would serve no useful purpose.  \nBecause venue \u201cis a separate and independent matter, \nanterior to the merits,\u201d id. at 558, further proceedings \non the merits in the Fifth Circuit would not affect the \nresolution of the venue issue presented by this certio-\nrari petition. \nPostponing review would, rather, needlessly prolong \nthe harms caused by the Fifth Circuit\u2019s interpretation \nof the Act.  The Fifth Circuit has, over the government\u2019s \nobjection, stayed proceedings in Vibe, Solo, and Alto \npending the disposition of the government\u2019s petition for \na writ of certiorari in Wages.  See Vibe C.A. Doc. 314-2, \nat 1-3 (Feb. 15, 2024).  Awaiting final judgment in these \ncases could thus involve a years-long delay.  In the \nmeantime, the Fifth Circuit\u2019s stays of FDA\u2019s denial or-\nders would remain in effect, and Reynolds and other \nmanufacturers would continue to sell e-cigarette prod-\nucts that FDA has never authorized.  \nFurther, petitions for review filed by out-of-circuit \nmanufacturers would continue to pile up in the Fifth \nCircuit.  Granting review now would ensure that those \npetitions are considered in the first instance in the ven-\nues required by the Act.  It would also avoid the dupli-\n\n21 \n \ncation of effort and waste of resources that would occur \nif the Fifth Circuit were to consider all those cases on \nthe merits, only for this Court to hold later that venue \nwas improper all along and that the Fifth Circuit should \nhave transferred the petitions to other courts.  Cf. \nLangdeau, 371 U.S. at 558 (\u201c[I]t serves the policy un-\nderlying the requirement of finality  * * *  to determine \nnow in which state court appellants may be tried, rather \nthan to subject them  * * *  to long and complex litiga-\ntion which may be all for naught if consideration of the \npreliminary question of venue is postponed until the \nconclusion of the proceedings.\u201d). \nCONCLUSION \nThe petition for a writ of certiorari should be granted. \nRespectfully submitted. \nSAMUEL R.

Reynolds Vapor Co. et al. do not meet the re-\nquirements of the Family Smoking Prevention and To-\nbacco Control Act for filing their petition here in the \nFifth Circuit.  This Act provides that \u201cany person ad-\n\n3a \n \nversely affected by such regulation or denial may file a \npetition for judicial review of such regulation or denial \nwith the United States Court of Appeals for the District \nof Columbia or for the circuit in which such person re-\nsides or has their principal place of business.\u201d  21 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 387l(a)(1).  We DENY the Motion.  All the \nPetitioners are \u201cperson[s] adversely affected\u201d under the \nAct, and two of the Petitioners, Avail Vapor Texas and \nthe Mississippi Petroleum Marketers and Convenience \nStores Association, have their principal places of busi-\nness here in the Fifth Circuit. \nI. \nThis Motion is the latest stage in an ongoing saga  \nbetween the R.J. Reynolds\u2019s vape devices manufactur-\ning and the FDA.  The FDA has denied R.J. Reynolds\u2019s  \napplications to market various e-cigarettes.  See 21 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 387j(a)(1)-(2).  At issue in this case, No. 23-60545, \nare menthol- and berry-flavored \u201cAlto\u201d e-cigarettes.  \nOnly the menthol flavor is currently on the market.  \nPrevious stay orders in the lead case, No. 23-60037,  \nhave concerned menthol-flavored \u201cVibe\u201d and \u201cSolo\u201d  \ne-cigarettes.  This case was consolidated with No. 23-\n60037 in an unpublished order on October 19, 2023.  In \nthis Motion, the FDA renews arguments it raised in its \nprevious motion to transfer, which this court denied in a \none-sentence, unpublished per curiam opinion on June \n27, 2023.  This court has also already held that venue is \nproper.  R.J. Reynolds Vapor Co. v. FDA, 65 F.4th 182, \n188 (5th Cir. 2023). \n \n \n\n4a \n \nII. \nThis court remains bound by our holding in the pub-\nlished opinion that venue is proper in this circuit.  R.J. \nReynolds Vapor Co, 65 F.4th at 188.  The only differ-\nences between that earlier case and this one is that an-\nother R.J. Reynolds product was involved, and at least \none different distributor.  The FDA did not make its \npresent statutory arguments at that time.  Stare deci-\nsis governs venue here so long as the distributors have \nstanding, which they do. \nThe FDA\u2019s arguments to the contrary are unavailing.  \nIts arguments that the retail Petitioners could not law-\nfully have been selling the e-cigarettes without prior ap-\nproval does not show that the Petitioners lose standing.  \nThe Tobacco Control Act gives standing to \u201cany person \nadversely affected.\u201d  21 U.S.C. \u00a7 387l(a)(1) (emphasis \nadded).  Retail Petitioner Avail Vapor Texas submitted \na declaration that \u201c[i]f Avail were not allowed to sell \nVuse products, Vuse Inspiration Store would have to \nclose, and Avail would cease its business operations.\u201d  \nThe Tobacco Control Act grants the Petitioners statu-\ntory standing to challenge FDA decisions that affect \nthem. \nSimilarly, the FDA\u2019s argument that the Act states \nelsewhere that only the \u201cholder of [the] application\u201d can \nchallenge a marketing withdrawal order, 21 U.S.C.  \n\u00a7 387j(d)(2), has no bearing on who can challenge a de-\nnial order.  \u201cWhere Congress includes particular lan-\nguage in one section of a statute but omits it in another \nsection of the same Act, it is generally presumed that \nCongress acts intentionally and purposely in the dispar-\nate inclusion or exclusion.\u201d  Russello v. United States, \n464 U.S. 16, 23, 104 S. Ct. 296 (1983).  Here, Congress \n\n5a \n \ndid not limit access to the courts for those challenging a \ndenial order in the same way it did for those challenging \na withdrawal order.  If the FDA disagrees with Con-\ngress\u2019s policy choice in so drafting the Tobacco Control \nAct, its concerns are better directed to Congress than to \nthis court.  See Barnhart v. Sigmon Coal Co., 534 U.S. \n438, 462, 122 S. Ct. 941 (2002) (\u201cWe will not alter the text \nin order to satisfy the policy preferences of the Commis-\nsioner.  These are battles that should be fought among \nthe political branches and the industry.\u201d). \nThe FDA\u2019s accusation of forum shopping fails be-\ncause the retail entities are undisputedly in this circuit, \nand they provided declarations that they would \u201ccease \nbusiness operations\u201d if the FDA\u2019s denial order went into \neffect.  Its arguments relating to the confidentiality \nprovisions are not probative of the meaning of the \nphrase \u201cadversely affected\u201d in a different portion of the \nAct.  And its argument that the Tobacco Control Act \nshould be read to favor the protection of the public from \ntobacco over the interests of the retail Petitioners fails \nin light of the statutory purpose of \u201ccontinu[ing] to per-\nmit the sale of tobacco products to adults.\u201d  See Family \nSmoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act, Pub. L. \n111-31, 123 Stat. 1776, 1782. \nIII. \nAll the Petitioners have statutory standing as \u201cper-\nson[s] adversely affected\u201d under the Tobacco Control \nAct, and both Avail Vapor Texas and the Mississippi Pe-\ntroleum Marketers and Convenience Stores Association \nhave their principal place of business in the Fifth Cir-\ncuit.  We therefore DENY the FDA\u2019s Motion to Trans-\nfer or Dismiss. \n\n6a \n \nSTEPHEN A. HIGGINSON, Circuit Judge: \nIn the above-captioned consolidated cases before us \n\u2014Case Nos. 23-60037, 23-60128, and 23-60545\u2014are \nthree pending motions:  (1) R.J. Reynolds Vapor Com-\npany\u2019s (Reynolds) motion for stay pending review in \nCase No. 23-60545 (concerning Reynolds\u2019s premarket \napplication for its \u201cAlto\u201d product); (2) the FDA\u2019s motion \nto dismiss or transfer Case No. 23-60545; and (3) the \nFDA\u2019s motion to lift the previously-granted stays of pro-\nceedings in Case Nos. 23-60037 and 23-60128 (concern-\ning Reynolds\u2019s premarket application for its \u201cVibe\u201d and \n\u201cSolo\u201d products, respectively). \nA motions panel of this court previously accepted that \nvenue was proper in Case Nos. 23-60037 and 23-60128 be-\ncause \u201ca petitioner\u201d\u2014Mississippi Petroleum Marketers \nand Convenience Stores Association\u2014\u201chas its \u2018principal \nplace of business here\u2019\u200a\u201d in the Fifth Circuit, while \u201cat \nleast one\u201d other petitioner, Reynolds, \u201chas standing.\u201d  \nR.J. Reynolds Vapor Company v. FDA, 65 F.4th 182, \n188 (5th Cir. 2023) (emphasis added).  In its pending \nmotion to dismiss or transfer, the FDA contends this \n\u201cmix-and-match approach\u201d is impermissible because it \nviolates the requirements set forth in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 387l(a) \nand is at odds with the structure and purpose of the To-\nbacco Control Act (TCA). \nWhile Petitioners are correct that the FDA has un-\nsuccessfully raised these arguments regarding venue in \nprior related matters, the FDA is equally correct in un-\nderscoring that neither of the two prior motions panels \naddressed the government\u2019s arguments on the merits.  \nAnd although today\u2019s panel does engage, it fails to ad-\ndress the principal defect with Petitioners\u2019 argument:  \nits position would render the venue limitations in 21 \n\n7a \n \nU.S.C. \u00a7 387l(a)(1) surplusage.  This expansive reading \nof venue cannot seem to be reconciled with the other \nprovisions of the TCA\u2014including retailers\u2019 inability to \nsue when marketing authorization is withdrawn, see 21 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 387j(d)(2), which naturally would more directly \nimpair their interests; and the confidentiality require-\nments regarding the information contained in retailers\u2019 \nmarketing applications, see, e.g., 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 387f(c).  \nNor, ultimately, can Reynolds\u2019 position be harmonized \nwith the purpose of the TCA, which the panel majority \ncharacterizes as \u201ccontinu[ing] to permit the sale of to-\nbacco products to adults,\u201d truncating the remainder of \nthe text in that clause\u2014\u201cin conjunction with measures \nto ensure that they are not sold or accessible to under-\nage purchasers\u201d\u2014as well as skipping over the nine \nother stated purposes, including \u201cto ensure that the \n[FDA] has the authority to address issues of particular \nconcern to public health officials, especially the use of \ntobacco by young people and dependence on tobacco\u201d \nand \u201cto authorize the [FDA] to set national standards \ncontrolling the manufacture of tobacco products.\u201d  \nFamily Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act, \nPub. L. 111-31, 123 Stat. 1776, 1781-82. \nA fair reading of the text and the purpose of the TCA \ncompels me to dissent.  I would transfer this case to ei-\nther the D.C. Circuit or the Fourth Circuit.  Those two \ncourts have already ruled on questions central to these \ncases in a manner that is adverse to Reynolds\u2019 position.  \nSee Prohibition Juice Co. v. FDA, 45 F.4th 8 (D.C. Cir. \n2022); Avail Vapor, LLC v. FDA, 55 F.4th 409 (4th Cir. \n2022), cert. denied, No. 22-1112, 2023 WL 6558399 (Oct. \n10, 2023).  By contrast, our court had as well, but va-\ncated and effectively reversed that decision en banc, in \nconflict with the majority of circuits to have addressed \n\n8a \n \nthe same issue.  See Wages & White Lion Invs., L.L.C. \nv. FDA, 90 F.4th 357, 392 (5th Cir. 2024) (Haynes, J., \ndissenting). \n \n\n9a \n \nAPPENDIX B \n \nU.S. Food & Drug Administration \n10903 New Hampshire Avenue \nSilver Spring, MD 20993 \nwww.fda.gov \nOct. 12, 2023 \nDENIAL \nR.J. Reynolds Vapor Company  \nAttention:  Ryan Potts, Ph.D. \nSenior Vice President, Scientific & Regulatory Affairs \nRAI Services Company \n950 Reynolds Boulevard  \nWinston-Salem, NC 27101 \nFDA Submission Tracking Numbers (STNs):  Multiple \nSTNs, see Appendix A  \nDear Ryan Potts: \nWe are denying a marketing granted order for the prod-\nucts identified in Appendix A.  Refer to Appendix B for \na list of amendments received in support of your appli-\ncations. \nThe statute places the burden on the applicant to make \nthe required showing by providing that FDA \u201cshall deny \nan application\u201d for a product to receive a PMTA market-\ning authorization if, \u201cupon the basis of the information \nsubmitted to the Secretary as part of the application and \nany other information before the Secretary with respect \nto such tobacco product,\u201d FDA finds that \u201cthere is a lack \nof a showing that permitting such tobacco product to be \nmarketed would be appropriate for the protection of the \n\n10a \n \npublic health\u201d (APPH).  Based on our review of your \nPMTAs 1,we determined that the new products, as de-\nscribed in your applications and specified in Appendix A, \nlack sufficient evidence to demonstrate that the market-\ning of these products is APPH.  You cannot introduce or \ndeliver for introduction these products into interstate \ncommerce in the United States. Doing so is a prohibited \nact under section 301(a) of the FD&C Act, the violation of \nwhich could result in enforcement action by FDA. \nIf you choose to submit new applications for these prod-\nucts, you must fulfill all requirements set forth in section \n910(b)(1) and 21 CFR Part 1114.  You may provide in-\nformation to fulfill some of these requirements by in-\ncluding an authorization for FDA to cross-reference a \nTobacco Product Master File. 2  You may not cross- \nreference information submitted in the PMTAs subject \nto this Denial. \nBased on review of your PMTAs, we identified the fol-\nlowing key basis for our determination: \n1. Your PMTAs (PM0000973.PD4, PM0000973.PD5, \nPM0000973.PD8, PM0000973.PD9, PM0000973. \nPD12, and PM0000973.PD13) lack sufficient evi-\ndence demonstrating that the new products have \na potential to benefit adult smokers in terms of \ncomplete switching or significant cigarette use \nreduction that would outweigh the risk to youth. \n \n1  Premarket Tobacco Product Applications (PMTAs) submitted \nunder section 910 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act \n(FD&C Act) \n2 See guidelines at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/ \nsearch-fda-guidance-documents/tobacco-product-master-files \n\n11a \n \nThere is substantial evidence that flavored ENDS \n(including menthol), like the new products, have sig-\nnificant appeal to youth and are associated with \nyouth initiation of such products.  The marketing \nrestrictions and other mitigation measures that you \nproposed cannot mitigate these risks to youth suffi-\nciently to reduce the magnitude of adult benefit re-\nquired to demonstrate that permitting the marketing \nof these products would be APPH.  In light of the \nknown risks to youth of marketing flavored ENDS \n(including menthol flavor), robust and reliable evi-\ndence is needed regarding the magnitude of the po-\ntential benefit to adult smokers.  This evidence \ncould have been provided using a randomized con-\ntrolled trial, longitudinal cohort study, or other reli-\nable and robust evidence demonstrating the benefit \nof the new product to adult smokers relative to  \ntobacco-flavored ENDS products, which present less \nrisk to youth.  Such evidence should have included \nan appropriate comparator tobacco-flavored ENDS.  \nReliable and robust evidence is needed to evaluate \nthe impact of the new product as compared to  \ntobacco-flavored products on adult combusted ciga-\nrette users\u2019 complete switching or significant reduc-\ntion in cigarette use over time because tobacco- \nflavored products have not been shown to present the \nsame risks to youth as tobacco products with other \ncharacterizing flavors.  Whether other products \ngive adult combusted cigarette users comparable op-\ntions for complete switching or significant cigarette \nreduction bears on the extent of the public health \nbenefit that the new product arguably provides to \nthat population.  Moreover, although this evidence \nis necessary to demonstrate that the subject ENDS \n\n12a \n \nprovide benefits for adult combusted cigarette users, \nit may not be sufficient to demonstrate that permit-\nting the marketing of the subject ENDS is appropri-\nate for the protection of the public health.  Applica-\ntions containing this evidence of benefit to adults \nwould still be evaluated to determine that the totality \nof the evidence supports a marketing authorization. \nBased on the information that you provided, there is \na lack of evidence to demonstrate that the subject \nENDS, relative to tobacco-flavored ENDS, would \nprovide an added benefit for adult smokers that is ad-\nequate to outweigh the substantial risks to youth.  \nYour PMTAs included information from longitudinal \nstudies, the PATH Study and the Colorado Longitu-\ndinal Study, which assessed changes in tobacco use \nbehavior\u2014namely, the extent to which adult smokers \nbecome dual users or exclusive ENDS users through \nthe use of ENDS products.  These results showed \nthat a small percentage of smokers (~5%) completely \nswitch to ENDS.  Between Wave 1 and Wave 3 of \nthe PATH Study, 1.5% of adults who were exclusively \nsmoking at Wave 1 transitioned to exclusive ENDS \nuse.  An additional 5.3% of adult dual users of ciga-\nrettes and ENDS at baseline became exclusive \nENDS users.  In the Colorado Longitudinal Study, \n4.6% of baseline dual users had completely switched \nto ENDS at the 6-month follow-up.  However, these \nstudies were not brand, product, or flavor-specific, \nand the application provided no information to demon-\nstrate that these conclusions apply to the subject \nproducts, much less that your flavored new products \nare more likely to promote complete switching or sig-\nnificant cigarette reduction compared to tobacco- \nflavored products.  Further, your PMTAs included \n\n13a \n \ndata from the National Tobacco Behavior Monitor \n(NTBM) and Total Tobacco Migration Tracker (TTM) \npopulation surveys, which showed Vuse Solo (as a \nproxy for Vuse Alto) users who reported using a non-\ntobacco flavor had a significantly higher odds of be-\ning a former vs. current cigarette smoker (NTBM: \nOR = 1.97, 95% CI: 1.40-2.77, p<0.0001; TTM:  OR \n= 2.16, 95% CI: 1.21-3.86, p<0.009).  These data are \nfrom users of Vuse Solo and therefore are not specific \nto the new products.  Moreover, these analyses \nwere cross-sectional and thus do not enable a reliable \nevaluation of former smokers\u2019 behavior change over \ntime.  In addition, the published literature on the \nrole of flavored ENDS and smoking cessation or re-\nduction did not demonstrate that flavored ENDS are \nmore effective in promoting complete switching or \nsignificant cigarette reduction relative to tobacco-fla-\nvored ENDS. \nThus, based on your studies and the peer-reviewed \nstudies in the literature, FDA is unable to determine \nwhether or to what extent your flavored new prod-\nucts facilitate complete switching or significant ciga-\nrette reduction as compared to tobacco-flavored ENDS \nproducts.  Given the known risks to youth of mar-\nketing flavored ENDS, FDA needed this information \nto demonstrate that your flavored new products \n(PM0000973.PD4, PM0000973.PD5, PM0000973.PD8, \nPM0000973.PD9, PM0000973.PD12, PM0000973.PD13) \nwould provide a benefit to adult smokers sufficient to \noutweigh their risk to youth. \nThe PMTAs did not contain evidence (whether from \nan RCT, longitudinal cohort, or other study design) \nregarding the impact of the new products on com-\n\n14a \n \nplete switching or significantly reducing cigarette \nuse that could adequately demonstrate that the fla-\nvored new products were more likely to promote \ncomplete switching or significant cigarette reduction \ncompared to tobacco-flavored products that present \nless risk of youth initiation and use.  The other evi-\ndence provided in the PMTAs regarding the potential \nbenefit to adult users is likewise inadequate to make \nthe required showing, due to the absence of robust, \nproduct-specific evidence of actual behavior change, \nin the form of complete switching or significant re-\nduction in CPD among adult CC smokers, beyond \nthat of tobacco-flavored ENDS products.  Together, \nbased on the information provided in the PMTAs and \nthe available evidence, the PMTAs lack sufficient ev-\nidence to show that the new products have the poten-\ntial to benefit adult smokers that wouldoutweigh the \nrisk to youth. \nThe review concluded that key evidence demonstrating \nAPPH is absent.  Therefore, scientific review did not \nproceed to assess other aspects of the applications.  \nFDA finds that it is not practicable to identify at this \ntime an exhaustive list of all possible deficiencies. \nYour PMTAs lack sufficient information to support a \nfinding of APPH.  Because you have not met your bur-\nden of \u201cshowing\u201d that permitting the marketing of the \nnew products would be APPH as required by Section \n910(c)(2)(A), we are issuing a marketing denial order.  \nYour products are misbranded under section 903(a)(6) \nof the FD&C Act and adulterated under section \n902(6)(A) of the FD&C Act.  Failure to comply with the \nFD&C Act may result in FDA regulatory action without \nfurther notice.

          "task_beliefs": "I began with no specific knowledge of this case. My understanding has now been refined to identify the core legal dispute. The central issue is a question of statutory interpretation concerning the judicial review provision of the Tobacco Control Act. Specifically, the case hinges on the meaning of the phrase \"adversely affected.\" The key question for the Court is whether this phrase grants the right to seek judicial review only to the direct subject of an FDA order (the manufacturer, R.J. Reynolds Vapor) or if it also extends to third parties who suffer a direct economic consequence of that order (the retailers). This is a classic question of legal standing, which determines who has the right to bring a lawsuit. My immediate goal is to understand the specific arguments each party will make to support their interpretation of \"adversely affected.\"",
          "design_beliefs": "I started with no knowledge of effective strategies for predicting Supreme Court outcomes. I have now developed an initial set of effective heuristics for analyzing statutory interpretation cases. A critical first step is to deconstruct the case facts to isolate the precise legal question and the specific statutory text at its heart. Framing this specific question within a broader, established legal doctrine\u2014in this instance, recognizing the interpretation of \"adversely affected\" as a question of standing\u2014is a powerful method for structuring the analysis and guiding the search for relevant precedents. For information gathering, prioritizing primary legal documents like the petition for a writ of certiorari and the main party briefs is a superior strategy to relying on secondary sources, as they contain the exact arguments the Court will consider. Furthermore, I've learned that the framing of an argument by the U.S. Solicitor General's office is a particularly valuable signal, as that office's arguments are often highly influential with the Court. Therefore, analyzing their briefs is a high-priority task for both understanding the government's position and gaining meta-insight into how the Court might perceive the case."

This is a powerful argument, but it is completely one-sided. The proposed action\u2014retrieving the Brief in Opposition\u2014is the single most efficient way to acquire the counter-narrative and the specific legal arguments R.J. Reynolds will use to rebut the government's claims. This will dramatically reduce my uncertainty about the case's outcome, representing a very high Task EIG. On the design level, this action directly tests and will likely validate my evolving methodology: that after analyzing the cert petition, the next highest-value source is the brief in opposition. It will also provide crucial data on how respondents counter the 'interconnected statutory analysis' heuristic I just developed, thus refining my general predictive model. The potential to both drastically improve my specific prediction and solidify a core component of my general strategy makes this a very high-value action.",

In the mid-2000s, e-cigarettes emerged as an \nalternative to traditional cigarettes without the \nhealth risks of inhaling the smoke from burned \ntobacco. E-cigarettes heat a nicotine-containing \nliquid into an inhalable aerosol. Per the Director of \nFDA\u2019s Center for Tobacco Products (\u201cCTP\u201d), \u201ctobacco \nproducts exist on a continuum of risk.\u201d1 Relative to \ncigarettes, e-cigarettes are far down on that \ncontinuum. E-cigarettes are potentially 95% less \nharmful than cigarettes.2 FDA\u2019s Commissioner said, \n\u201cIf you could take every adult smoker \u2026 and fully \nswitch them to e-cigarettes, that would have a \nsubstantial public health impact.\u201d3 \nIn 2009, Congress enacted the Family Smoking \nPrevention and Tobacco Control Act (the \u201cTCA\u201d or \nthe \u201cAct\u201d), Pub. L. No. 111-31, Div. A, 123 Stat. 1776. \nThe Act requires manufacturers of certain \u201cnew\u201d \ntobacco products (those not marketed by 2007) to \nobtain \nFDA \nmarketing \nauthorization \nvia \na \npremarket tobacco product application. 21 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 387j. The standard for authorization is whether \nmarketing the product is \u201cappropriate for the \nprotection of the public health.\u201d Id. \u00a7 387j(c)(2). The \nAct initially covered only certain tobacco products \n(e.g., cigarettes and roll-your-own tobacco), but it \n \n1 Brian A. King & Benjamin A.

FDA, 90 F.4th 357, \n363 (5th Cir. 2024) (en banc). As a result, \nmanufacturers \nhad \nto \nobtain \nmarketing \nauthorization from FDA, even for e-cigarettes that \nhad already been on the market for years. Id. FDA, \nhowever, determined that removing on-market \ne-cigarettes would harm the public health; as a \nresult, it established an enforcement-discretion \npolicy to allow certain such e-cigarettes (including \nmenthol Vuse Alto) to remain on the market pending \nthe filing and resolution of marketing applications.4 \n2.  Respondent R.J. Reynolds Vapor Co. (\u201cRJRV\u201d) \nmanufactures and markets tobacco- and menthol-\nflavored Vuse e-cigarettes. See C.A. Stay Mot. 3, R.J. \nReynolds Vapor Co. v. FDA, No. 23-60545 (5th Cir. \nOct. 20, 2023) (\u201cAlto\u201d). Vuse is the Nation\u2019s market-\nleading e-cigarette brand among adults, and Vuse \nAlto is the most popular Vuse product. Id. at 1.  \nRespondent Avail Vapor Texas, L.L.C. (\u201cAvail\u201d), \nand members of Respondent trade association \nMississippi Petroleum Marketers and Convenience \n \n4 See 81 Fed. Reg. 28,974, 28,977 (May 10, 2016); see \nalso id. at 29,001 (\u201cas a practical effect of the Agency\u2019s \ncompliance \npolicy \u2026 FDA \nexpects \nthat \nmany \nmanufacturers \u2026 will continue to market their products\u201d); \nFDA, Enforcement Priorities for Electronic Nicotine Delivery \nSystems and Other Deemed Products on the Market Without \nPremarket Authorization 27 (Apr. 2020). \n\n \n3 \n \n \nStores Association (\u201cMississippi Association\u201d), are \nretailers that sell menthol-flavored Vuse Alto. Avail \nprincipally sells Vuse products and, \u201cif Avail were \nnot allowed to sell Vuse products, \u2026 Avail would \ncease its business operations.\u201d See C.A. Amended \nOrder 4, Alto (5th Cir. Feb. 2, 2024).  \n3.  As noted above, e-cigarettes need to obtain FDA \nauthorization. In compliance with that requirement, \nRJRV spent millions of dollars and thousands of \nemployee hours on its Vuse applications, and timely \nsubmitted each of them. Alto C.A. Stay Mot. 7 (Oct. \n20, 2023). \nIn a series of orders, FDA denied marketing \nauthorization for four styles of menthol Vuse e-\ncigarettes, \nincluding \nVuse \nAlto. \nThe \nsame \nRespondents petitioned for review of each of those \ndenial orders. See C.A. Pet. for Rev., No. 23-60037 \n(5th Cir. Jan. 24, 2023) (\u201cVibe\u201d); C.A. Pet. for Rev., \nNo. 23-60128 (5th Cir. Mar. 17, 2023) (\u201cSolo\u201d); Alto \nC.A. Pet. for Rev. (Oct. 12, 2023). The Fifth Circuit \nconsolidated these actions and stayed FDA\u2019s denial \norders as to RJRV\u2019s currently marketed products. \nVibe C.A. Consolidation Order (Mar. 22, 2023); Alto \nC.A. Consolidation Order (Oct. 19, 2023); Vibe 65 \nF.4th 182 (5th Cir. 2023); Solo C.A. Stay Order (Mar. \n29, 2023); Alto C.A. Stay Order (Feb. 2, 2024). The \nFifth Circuit concluded that Respondents are likely \nto succeed on their claims that FDA acted arbitrarily \nin issuing the denial orders and \u201cinstituted a de facto \nban on non-tobacco-flavored e-cigarettes without \ngoing through notice-and-comment.\u201d Vibe, 65 F.4th \nat 194. \n\n \n4 \n \n \nIn doing so, the Fifth Circuit rejected FDA\u2019s venue \nobjections. First, in staying the denial order as to \nmenthol Vuse Vibe, the Fifth Circuit held \u201c[v]enue is \nproper because [Mississippi Association] has its \n\u2018principal place of business\u2019 here.\u201d Vibe, 65 F.4th at \n188 & n.5. The Fifth Circuit also summarily rejected \nFDA\u2019s motion to transfer the Vibe and Solo cases to \nthe D.C. Circuit. Vibe C.A. Order (June 27, 2023). \nAnd the court of appeals denied FDA\u2019s motion to \ndismiss or transfer the Alto petition to the Fourth or \nD.C. Circuit, holding, \u201cAll the Petitioners are \n\u2018persons adversely affected\u2019 under the Act, and two of \nthe Petitioners, Avail Vapor Texas and [Mississippi \nAssociation], have their principal places of business \nhere in the Fifth Circuit.\u201d Alto C.A. Amended Order \n3 (Feb. 2, 2024). Judge Higginson dissented. The \nFifth Circuit then denied FDA\u2019s petition for \nrehearing en banc of the Vibe stay order, in which \nFDA again raised its venue objection. Vibe C.A. \nOrder (Feb. 6, 2024). \nHaving failed to persuade the Fifth Circuit, FDA \nnow turns to this Court, seeking interlocutory review \nof two splitless issues.  \nREASONS FOR DENYING THE PETITION \nThe TCA\u2019s judicial-review provision allows \u201cany \nperson adversely affected\u201d by FDA\u2019s marketing \ndenial order to \u201cfile a petition for judicial review\u201d in \nthe D.C. Circuit or \u201cthe circuit in which such person \nresides or has their principal place of business.\u201d 21 \nU.S.C. \n\u00a7 387l(a)(1). \nBasic \nrules \nof \nstatutory \ninterpretation, as well as this Court\u2019s \u201czone of \ninterests\u201d test for statutory standing, show that the \nFifth Circuit correctly concluded that manufacturers \n\n \n5 \n \n \nand retailers\u2014both of whom are regulated and \nprotected by a number of provisions in the TCA\u2014\nqualify as \u201cany person[s] adversely affected.\u201d Id. \nSimply put, when an FDA order prohibits a retailer \nfrom selling a product, the retailer is \u201cadversely \naffected\u201d by the order. And when such a retailer \npetitions in its home circuit, any other adversely \naffected person may join that petition. \nAdditionally, as FDA admits, there is no circuit \nconflict over the meaning of this venue provision. \nAnd other vehicle problems abound. FDA is not only \nasking this Court to take the highly unusual step of \nbeing the first appellate court to review an \ninterlocutory procedural order (because this case was \nfirst filed in the court of appeals), but FDA is also \nasking this Court to become a court of first review on \nthe second question presented (because FDA never \nraised it below). And FDA makes the request without \neven trying to make the extraordinary showing that \nis required to seek certiorari before judgment. In any \nevent, interlocutory review of these questions, even if \nresolved in FDA\u2019s favor, would not resolve this case \nor even afford FDA the relief it seeks.  \nThis Court should therefore deny FDA\u2019s petition. \nI. \nTHE FIFTH CIRCUIT\u2019S DECISION IS CORRECT. \nThe TCA provides that \u201cany person adversely \naffected\u201d by a denial order may \u201cfile a petition for \njudicial review\u201d in the D.C. Circuit or \u201cthe circuit in \nwhich such person resides or has their principal \nplace of business.\u201d 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 387l(a)(1). A retailer \nthat cannot sell a product because of an FDA denial \norder is obviously \u201cadversely affected\u201d by that order. \nThe \nFifth \nCircuit \nthus \ncorrectly \nheld \nthat \n\n \n6 \n \n \nmanufacturers \nand \nretailers\u2014like \nRespondents \nhere\u2014are \u201c\u2018persons adversely affected\u2019 under the \nAct,\u201d and that they therefore have a statutory right \nto seek judicial review of a denial order. Alto C.A. \nAmended Order 3 (Feb. 2, 2024). And because Avail \nand Mississippi Association \u201chave their principal \nplaces of business \u2026 in the Fifth Circuit\u201d\u2014facts that \nFDA does not dispute\u2014venue is proper in the Fifth \nCircuit. Id.5 The plain text of the TCA\u2019s judicial-\nreview provision and well-established \u201cstatutory \nstanding\u201d doctrine compel such a conclusion.  \nFDA\u2019s alternative argument\u2014that where multiple \nadversely \naffected \nparties \npetition \nfor \nreview \ntogether, each must individually satisfy the statute\u2019s \nvenue requirements\u2014fares no better. In addition to \nbeing wrong, FDA forfeited this argument by failing \nto raise it below. Nothing in the statute requires \nretailers and manufacturers to file separate petitions \nin different courts to challenge the same FDA denial \norder.  \n1.  The TCA expressly and unambiguously allows \nretailers like Respondent Avail and members of \nRespondent Mississippi Association to challenge \nFDA marketing denial orders. The Act says, \u201cany \nperson adversely affected by\u201d a denial order \u201cmay file \na petition for judicial review of such \u2026 denial with \nthe United States Court of Appeals for the District of \nColumbia or for the circuit in which such person \nresides or has their principal place of business.\u201d 21 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 387l(a)(1). FDA claims that the retailer \n \n5 Mississippi Association and Avail also reside in the \nFifth Circuit because they are incorporated or formed there. \nAlto C.A. Opp\u2019n to Mot. to Dismiss or Transfer 6 (Oct. 30, 2023). \n\n \n7 \n \n \nRespondents (who are indisputably located in the \nFifth Circuit) cannot provide the basis for venue \nbecause they are not \u201cadversely affected\u201d by FDA\u2019s \ndenial order and therefore lack a statutory right to \nchallenge that order. The Fifth Circuit correctly \nrejected that argument. \nRetailers \n(including \nRespondent \nAvail \nand \nmembers of Respondent Mississippi Association) who \nsell the product subject to a denial order are plainly \n\u201cadversely affected\u201d by an order that will cause them \nto lose substantial revenue and, in the case of \nRespondent Avail, shutter its operations if it is not \nallowed to sell Vuse products. They therefore fall \nsquarely within the provision\u2019s scope. \nFDA does not dispute that retailers are injured by \nFDA\u2019s denial order in an Article III sense.6 Instead, \nFDA contends that retailers\u2014even those suffering \ncognizable injury\u2014are never \u201cadversely affected\u201d by \na denial order, and only the applicant (i.e., \nmanufacturer) is. In other words, the fact that FDA\u2019s \ndenial order for menthol Vuse Alto directly harms \nthe retailer Respondents does not, in FDA\u2019s view, \nqualify as an \u201cadverse[ ] [e]ffect.\u201d FDA\u2019s position \nflouts both the TCA\u2019s text and this Court\u2019s \npermissive criteria for assessing whether a party \ninvoking a judicial-review provision has statutory \nstanding. \n \n6 Below, FDA at one point seemed to suggest that the \nagency\u2019s objection had something to do with jurisdiction. \nHowever, FDA\u2019s petition for certiorari makes clear that its \nobjection is to venue, not jurisdiction. See Alto C.A. Opp\u2019n to \nMot. to Transfer 4 (Oct. 30, 2023) (noting FDA \u201cabandon[ed] \nreliance on 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1631\u201d). \n\n \n8 \n \n \na. Start with the statute\u2019s plain text: \u201cany person \nadversely affected.\u201d 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 387l(a)(1). As this \nCourt has explained, \u201cthe word \u2018any\u2019 has an \nexpansive \nmeaning, \nthat \nis, \n\u2018one \nor \nsome \nindiscriminately of whatever kind.\u2019\u201d United States v. \nGonzales, 520 U.S. 1, 5 (1997). So Congress made \nclear that all persons (so long as they are adversely \naffected by an order) are entitled to file suit. \nAccordingly, Respondents (who are indisputably \n\u201cpersons\u201d under the Act) clearly fall within the \ncategory of \u201cany person.\u201d The key phrase then is \n\u201cadversely affected.\u201d \u201cAdverse\u201d means \u201cin opposition \nto one\u2019s interests.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New Int\u2019l \nDictionary 31 (1981). And \u201caffected\u201d means \u201cto \nproduce an effect \u2026 upon\u201d or \u201cto have a detrimental \ninfluence on.\u201d Id. at 35. Thus, the full phrase means \na person who experiences an effect or detrimental \ninfluence that is in opposition to their interests. \nHere, it is clear as can be that the denial order will \nhave a \u201can effect upon\u201d \n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

The Family Smoking \nPrevention and Tobacco Control Act, Pub. L. No. 111-\n31, Div. A, 123 Stat. 1776, requires e-cigarettes to \nobtain marketing authorization from FDA. \nIf FDA denies authorization, the Tobacco Control \nAct allows \u201cany person adversely affected\u201d by the \ndenial order to \u201cfile a petition for judicial review\u201d in \nthe D.C. Circuit or \u201cthe circuit in which such person \nresides or has their principal place of business.\u201d 21 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 387l(a)(1). Here, FDA denied authorization \nfor menthol-flavored Vuse Alto, and four entities, \nincluding the manufacturer and retailers of the \nproduct, filed a petition for review in the U.S. Court \nof Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. That court \ndetermined that venue is proper under the Act \nbecause the retailers are \u201cadversely affected\u201d by the \ndenial order\u2014FDA\u2019s order means they cannot legally \nsell the product\u2014and located in the Fifth Circuit. \nThe questions presented are:   \n1.  Whether a retailer that may not sell a tobacco \nproduct due to an FDA denial order qualifies as \u201cany \nperson adversely affected\u201d under the Tobacco Control \nAct such that it may file a petition for judicial review \nof the denial order in the circuit where it resides or \nhas its principal place of business. \n2.  Where multiple petitioners join a single petition \nfor review of an FDA denial of a marketing \napplication for a tobacco product, whether all \npetitioners may participate in the case if one \npetitioner has established venue. \n\nii \n \nRULE 29.6 STATEMENT \nR.J.

In the mid-2000s, e-cigarettes emerged as an \nalternative to traditional cigarettes without the \nhealth risks of inhaling the smoke from burned \ntobacco. E-cigarettes heat a nicotine-containing \nliquid into an inhalable aerosol. Per the Director of \nFDA\u2019s Center for Tobacco Products (\u201cCTP\u201d), \u201ctobacco \nproducts exist on a continuum of risk.\u201d1 Relative to \ncigarettes, e-cigarettes are far down on that \ncontinuum. E-cigarettes are potentially 95% less \nharmful than cigarettes.2 FDA\u2019s Commissioner said, \n\u201cIf you could take every adult smoker \u2026 and fully \nswitch them to e-cigarettes, that would have a \nsubstantial public health impact.\u201d3 \nIn 2009, Congress enacted the Family Smoking \nPrevention and Tobacco Control Act (the \u201cTCA\u201d or \nthe \u201cAct\u201d), Pub. L. No. 111-31, Div. A, 123 Stat. 1776. \nThe Act requires manufacturers of certain \u201cnew\u201d \ntobacco products (those not marketed by 2007) to \nobtain \nFDA \nmarketing \nauthorization \nvia \na \npremarket tobacco product application. 21 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 387j. The standard for authorization is whether \nmarketing the product is \u201cappropriate for the \nprotection of the public health.\u201d Id. \u00a7 387j(c)(2). The \nAct initially covered only certain tobacco products \n(e.g., cigarettes and roll-your-own tobacco), but it \n \n1 Brian A. King & Benjamin A.

FDA, 90 F.4th 357, \n363 (5th Cir. 2024) (en banc). As a result, \nmanufacturers \nhad \nto \nobtain \nmarketing \nauthorization from FDA, even for e-cigarettes that \nhad already been on the market for years. Id. FDA, \nhowever, determined that removing on-market \ne-cigarettes would harm the public health; as a \nresult, it established an enforcement-discretion \npolicy to allow certain such e-cigarettes (including \nmenthol Vuse Alto) to remain on the market pending \nthe filing and resolution of marketing applications.4 \n2.  Respondent R.J. Reynolds Vapor Co. (\u201cRJRV\u201d) \nmanufactures and markets tobacco- and menthol-\nflavored Vuse e-cigarettes. See C.A. Stay Mot. 3, R.J. \nReynolds Vapor Co. v. FDA, No. 23-60545 (5th Cir. \nOct. 20, 2023) (\u201cAlto\u201d). Vuse is the Nation\u2019s market-\nleading e-cigarette brand among adults, and Vuse \nAlto is the most popular Vuse product.

Avail \nprincipally sells Vuse products and, \u201cif Avail were \nnot allowed to sell Vuse products, \u2026 Avail would \ncease its business operations.\u201d See C.A. Amended \nOrder 4, Alto (5th Cir. Feb. 2, 2024).  \n3.  As noted above, e-cigarettes need to obtain FDA \nauthorization. In compliance with that requirement, \nRJRV spent millions of dollars and thousands of \nemployee hours on its Vuse applications, and timely \nsubmitted each of them. Alto C.A. Stay Mot. 7 (Oct. \n20, 2023). \nIn a series of orders, FDA denied marketing \nauthorization for four styles of menthol Vuse e-\ncigarettes, \nincluding \nVuse \nAlto. \nThe \nsame \nRespondents petitioned for review of each of those \ndenial orders. See C.A. Pet. for Rev., No. 23-60037 \n(5th Cir. Jan. 24, 2023) (\u201cVibe\u201d); C.A. Pet. for Rev., \nNo. 23-60128 (5th Cir. Mar. 17, 2023) (\u201cSolo\u201d); Alto \nC.A. Pet. for Rev. (Oct. 12, 2023). The Fifth Circuit \nconsolidated these actions and stayed FDA\u2019s denial \norders as to RJRV\u2019s currently marketed products. \nVibe C.A. Consolidation Order (Mar. 22, 2023); Alto \nC.A. Consolidation Order (Oct. 19, 2023); Vibe 65 \nF.4th 182 (5th Cir. 2023); Solo C.A. Stay Order (Mar. \n29, 2023); Alto C.A. Stay Order (Feb. 2, 2024). The \nFifth Circuit concluded that Respondents are likely \nto succeed on their claims that FDA acted arbitrarily \nin issuing the denial orders and \u201cinstituted a de facto \nban on non-tobacco-flavored e-cigarettes without \ngoing through notice-and-comment.\u201d Vibe, 65 F.4th \nat 194. \n\n \n4 \n \n \nIn doing so, the Fifth Circuit rejected FDA\u2019s venue \nobjections. First, in staying the denial order as to \nmenthol Vuse Vibe, the Fifth Circuit held \u201c[v]enue is \nproper because [Mississippi Association] has its \n\u2018principal place of business\u2019 here.\u201d Vibe, 65 F.4th at \n188 & n.5. The Fifth Circuit also summarily rejected \nFDA\u2019s motion to transfer the Vibe and Solo cases to \nthe D.C. Circuit. Vibe C.A. Order (June 27, 2023). \nAnd the court of appeals denied FDA\u2019s motion to \ndismiss or transfer the Alto petition to the Fourth or \nD.C. Circuit, holding, \u201cAll the Petitioners are \n\u2018persons adversely affected\u2019 under the Act, and two of \nthe Petitioners, Avail Vapor Texas and [Mississippi \nAssociation], have their principal places of business \nhere in the Fifth Circuit.\u201d Alto C.A. Amended Order \n3 (Feb. 2, 2024). Judge Higginson dissented. The \nFifth Circuit then denied FDA\u2019s petition for \nrehearing en banc of the Vibe stay order, in which \nFDA again raised its venue objection. Vibe C.A. \nOrder (Feb. 6, 2024). \nHaving failed to persuade the Fifth Circuit, FDA \nnow turns to this Court, seeking interlocutory review \nof two splitless issues.  \nREASONS FOR DENYING THE PETITION \nThe TCA\u2019s judicial-review provision allows \u201cany \nperson adversely affected\u201d by FDA\u2019s marketing \ndenial order to \u201cfile a petition for judicial review\u201d in \nthe D.C. Circuit or \u201cthe circuit in which such person \nresides or has their principal place of business.\u201d 21 \nU.S.C. \n\u00a7 387l(a)(1). \nBasic \nrules \nof \nstatutory \ninterpretation, as well as this Court\u2019s \u201czone of \ninterests\u201d test for statutory standing, show that the \nFifth Circuit correctly concluded that manufacturers \n\n \n5 \n \n \nand retailers\u2014both of whom are regulated and \nprotected by a number of provisions in the TCA\u2014\nqualify as \u201cany person[s] adversely affected.\u201d Id. \nSimply put, when an FDA order prohibits a retailer \nfrom selling a product, the retailer is \u201cadversely \naffected\u201d by the order. And when such a retailer \npetitions in its home circuit, any other adversely \naffected person may join that petition. \nAdditionally, as FDA admits, there is no circuit \nconflict over the meaning of this venue provision. \nAnd other vehicle problems abound. FDA is not only \nasking this Court to take the highly unusual step of \nbeing the first appellate court to review an \ninterlocutory procedural order (because this case was \nfirst filed in the court of appeals), but FDA is also \nasking this Court to become a court of first review on \nthe second question presented (because FDA never \nraised it below). And FDA makes the request without \neven trying to make the extraordinary showing that \nis required to seek certiorari before judgment. In any \nevent, interlocutory review of these questions, even if \nresolved in FDA\u2019s favor, would not resolve this case \nor even afford FDA the relief it seeks.  \nThis Court should therefore deny FDA\u2019s petition. \nI. \nTHE FIFTH CIRCUIT\u2019S DECISION IS CORRECT. \nThe TCA provides that \u201cany person adversely \naffected\u201d by a denial order may \u201cfile a petition for \njudicial review\u201d in the D.C. Circuit or \u201cthe circuit in \nwhich such person resides or has their principal \nplace of business.\u201d 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 387l(a)(1). A retailer \nthat cannot sell a product because of an FDA denial \norder is obviously \u201cadversely affected\u201d by that order. \nThe \nFifth \nCircuit \nthus \ncorrectly \nheld \nthat \n\n \n6 \n \n \nmanufacturers \nand \nretailers\u2014like \nRespondents \nhere\u2014are \u201c\u2018persons adversely affected\u2019 under the \nAct,\u201d and that they therefore have a statutory right \nto seek judicial review of a denial order. Alto C.A. \nAmended Order 3 (Feb. 2, 2024). And because Avail \nand Mississippi Association \u201chave their principal \nplaces of business \u2026 in the Fifth Circuit\u201d\u2014facts that \nFDA does not dispute\u2014venue is proper in the Fifth \nCircuit. Id.5 The plain text of the TCA\u2019s judicial-\nreview provision and well-established \u201cstatutory \nstanding\u201d doctrine compel such a conclusion.  \nFDA\u2019s alternative argument\u2014that where multiple \nadversely \naffected \nparties \npetition \nfor \nreview \ntogether, each must individually satisfy the statute\u2019s \nvenue requirements\u2014fares no better. In addition to \nbeing wrong, FDA forfeited this argument by failing \nto raise it below. Nothing in the statute requires \nretailers and manufacturers to file separate petitions \nin different courts to challenge the same FDA denial \norder.  \n1.  The TCA expressly and unambiguously allows \nretailers like Respondent Avail and members of \nRespondent Mississippi Association to challenge \nFDA marketing denial orders. The Act says, \u201cany \nperson adversely affected by\u201d a denial order \u201cmay file \na petition for judicial review of such \u2026 denial with \nthe United States Court of Appeals for the District of \nColumbia or for the circuit in which such person \nresides or has their principal place of business.\u201d 21 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 387l(a)(1). FDA claims that the retailer \n \n5 Mississippi Association and Avail also reside in the \nFifth Circuit because they are incorporated or formed there. \nAlto C.A. Opp\u2019n to Mot. to Dismiss or Transfer 6 (Oct. 30, 2023). \n\n \n7 \n \n \nRespondents (who are indisputably located in the \nFifth Circuit) cannot provide the basis for venue \nbecause they are not \u201cadversely affected\u201d by FDA\u2019s \ndenial order and therefore lack a statutory right to \nchallenge that order. The Fifth Circuit correctly \nrejected that argument. \nRetailers \n(including \nRespondent \nAvail \nand \nmembers of Respondent Mississippi Association) who \nsell the product subject to a denial order are plainly \n\u201cadversely affected\u201d by an order that will cause them \nto lose substantial revenue and, in the case of \nRespondent Avail, shutter its operations if it is not \nallowed to sell Vuse products. They therefore fall \nsquarely within the provision\u2019s scope. \nFDA does not dispute that retailers are injured by \nFDA\u2019s denial order in an Article III sense.6 Instead, \nFDA contends that retailers\u2014even those suffering \ncognizable injury\u2014are never \u201cadversely affected\u201d by \na denial order, and only the applicant (i.e., \nmanufacturer) is. In other words, the fact that FDA\u2019s \ndenial order for menthol Vuse Alto directly harms \nthe retailer Respondents does not, in FDA\u2019s view, \nqualify as an \u201cadverse[ ] [e]ffect.\u201d FDA\u2019s position \nflouts both the TCA\u2019s text and this Court\u2019s \npermissive criteria for assessing whether a party \ninvoking a judicial-review provision has statutory \nstanding. \n \n6 Below, FDA at one point seemed to suggest that the \nagency\u2019s objection had something to do with jurisdiction. \nHowever, FDA\u2019s petition for certiorari makes clear that its \nobjection is to venue, not jurisdiction. See Alto C.A. Opp\u2019n to \nMot. to Transfer 4 (Oct. 30, 2023) (noting FDA \u201cabandon[ed] \nreliance on 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1631\u201d). \n\n \n8 \n \n \na. Start with the statute\u2019s plain text: \u201cany person \nadversely affected.\u201d 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 387l(a)(1). As this \nCourt has explained, \u201cthe word \u2018any\u2019 has an \nexpansive \nmeaning, \nthat \nis, \n\u2018one \nor \nsome \nindiscriminately of whatever kind.\u2019\u201d United States v. \nGonzales, 520 U.S. 1, 5 (1997). So Congress made \nclear that all persons (so long as they are adversely \naffected by an order) are entitled to file suit. \nAccordingly, Respondents (who are indisputably \n\u201cpersons\u201d under the Act) clearly fall within the \ncategory of \u201cany person.\u201d The key phrase then is \n\u201cadversely affected.\u201d \u201cAdverse\u201d means \u201cin opposition \nto one\u2019s interests.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New Int\u2019l \nDictionary 31 (1981). And \u201caffected\u201d means \u201cto \nproduce an effect \u2026 upon\u201d or \u201cto have a detrimental \ninfluence on.\u201d Id. at 35. Thus, the full phrase means \na person who experiences an effect or detrimental \ninfluence that is in opposition to their interests. \nHere, it is clear as can be that the denial order will \nhave a \u201can effect upon\u201d and \u201ca detrimental influence \non\u201d the retailer Respondents\u2019 interests, since they \ncannot sell the product at issue and if they do, will be \nsubject to severe penalties, see infra p. 12. Therefore, \nunder the plain text, retailer Respondents are \u201cany \nperson adversely affected\u201d by FDA\u2019s order. \nb. FDA tries to escape the statute\u2019s plain text by \nemphasizing that \u201c\u2018adversely affected\u2019 is a term of art \nin administrative law,\u201d Pet. 11, but the Agency fares \nno better under this Court\u2019s statutory standing \njurisprudence. The zone-of-interests test that this \nCourt has applied to determine when a party is \nsufficiently aggrieved to challenge agency action \u201cis \nnot meant to be especially demanding.\u201d Match-E-Be-\nNash-She-Wish Band of Pottawatomi Indians v. \n\n \n9 \n \n \nPatchak, 567 U.S. 209, 225 (2012). A party has \nstatutory standing if it asserts an interest that is \n\u201carguably\u201d protected or regulated by the statute. \nE.g., id. at 225\u201326. The zone-of-interests test \n\u201cforecloses suit only when a plaintiff\u2019s interests are \nso marginally related to or inconsistent with the \npurposes implicit in the statute that it cannot \nreasonably be assumed that Congress intended to \npermit the suit.\u201d Id. All that is required is \u201csome \nindicia\u2014however slight\u2014that the litigant before the \ncourt \nwas \n[(i)] intended \nto \nbe \nprotected \u2026 or \n[(ii)] regulated by the statute\u201d\u2014either suffices. \nCalumet Indus., Inc. v. Brock, 807 F.2d 225, 228 \n(D.C. Cir. 1986). This is assessed using \u201ctraditional \ntools of statutory interpretation.\u201d Bank of Am. Corp. \nv. City of Miami, 581 U.S. 189, 197 (2017). And \u201cthe \nbenefit of any doubt goes to the plaintiff.\u201d Match-E-\nBe-Nash-She-Wish, 567 U.S. at 225. \u201c[F]inancial \ninjury \u2026 satisf[ies] \nthe \n\u2018cause-of-action\u2019 \n(or \n\u2018prudential standing\u2019) requirement.\u201d Bank of Am., \n581 U.S. at 197. \nThis Court\u2019s decision in Bank of America\u2014which \ninvolved a statute with virtually identical language \nabout who can sue\u2014controls this case. There, the \nCity of Miami sued several banks under the Fair \nHousing Act (\u201cFHA\u201d), alleging that the banks \nengaged in discriminatory lending in the residential \nhousing market that caused the City economic harm. \nIn concluding that the City came within the FHA\u2019s \nzone of interests, the Supreme Court stressed the \ntextual \nbreadth \nof \nthe \nFHA\u2019s \njudicial-review \nprovision: \u201cThe FHA permits any \u2018aggrieved person\u2019 \nto bring a housing-discrimination lawsuit.\u201d Id. \n(quoting 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3613(a)). Because the City \n\n \n10 \n \n \nclaimed that the banks\u2019 lending practices caused the \nCity\u2019s lost tax revenue, the Court concluded the City \nwas at least \u201carguably \u2026 within the FHA\u2019s zone of \ninterests\u201d\u2014even though the City did not suffer \ndiscrimination. Id. at 200\u201301.7 \nGiven this precedent, it is no wonder the Fifth \nCircuit rejected FDA\u2019s argument under the TCA. The \nstatutory language here\u2014\u201cany person adversely \naffected\u201d\u2014is, if anything, broader than the FHA\u2019s \n\u201caggrieved person\u201d language. And the connection \nbetween the retailers\u2019 injuries and the interests \nprotected by the TCA is far more direct than the \nconnection between the City\u2019s lost tax revenue in \nBank of America and the FHA. This case thus follows \na fortiori from Bank of America. See also Truck Ins. \nExch. v. Kaiser Gypsum Co., 144 S. Ct. 1414, 1423 \n(2024) (holding \u201can insurer such as Truck with \nfinancial responsibility for a bankruptcy claim is a \n\u2018party in interest\u2019 because it may be directly and \nadversely affected by the reorganization plan\u201d).8  \n \n7 Notably, the government filed an amicus brief in \nsupport of the position this Court adopted. See Brief for U.S. as \nAmicus Curiae Supporting Respondent, Bank of America, 581 \nU.S. 189, 2016 WL 5903233. \n8 The retailers\u2019 interests would establish standing even \nunder Justice Thomas\u2019s dissenting opinion in Bank of America. \nJustice Thomas concluded that the City\u2019s asserted injuries (lost \nrevenues and increased costs) did not implicate the interests \nprotected by the FHA. 581 U.S. at 207\u201309. (Thomas, J., \nconcurring in part, dissenting in part). Here, there is no \nquestion that the retailers\u2019 injuries (inability to sell a tobacco \nproduct) directly implicate the interests protected by the TCA. \nSee infra p. 12. \n\n \n11 \n \n \nc. \nThis \nstraightforward \ninterpretation \nof \n\u00a7 387l(a)(1), moreover, is confirmed by the structure \nof the TCA and statutory context. FDA seems to \nassert that, in allowing \u201cany person adversely \naffected\u201d to sue, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 387l(a)(1) (emphasis \nadded), Congress actually meant that \u201conly a \nmanufacturer of a product subject to a marketing \ndenial order\u201d or \u201conly an applicant whose premarket \napplication is denied\u201d could sue. But Congress knows \nhow to limit judicial-review provisions in that way, \nand, indeed, did so elsewhere in the TCA itself. \nCompare id. (\u201cany person adversely affected\u201d may \nchallenge marketing denial orders for tobacco \nproducts), with id. \u00a7 387j(d)(2) (\u201c[t]he holder of an \napplication\u201d may challenge the withdrawal of \nmarketing authorization for tobacco products). For \n\u00a7 387l(a)(1), in contrast, it uses the capacious phrase \n\u201cany person adversely affected.\u201d And \u201c[w]here \nCongress includes particular language in one section \nof a statute but omits it in another section of the \nsame Act, it is generally presumed that Congress \nacts intentionally and purposely in the disparate \ninclusion or exclusion.\u201d Alto C.A. Amended Order 4\u20135 \n(Feb. 2, 2024) (quoting Russello v. United States, 464 \nU.S. 16, 23 (1983)); see also id. at 5 (\u201cCongress did \nnot limit access to the courts for those challenging a \ndenial order in the same way it did for those \nchallenging a withdrawal order. If the FDA disagrees \nwith Congress\u2019s policy choice in so drafting the \n[TCA], its concerns are better directed to Congress \nthan to this court.\u201d). \nCongress also included rulemaking in the TCA\u2019s \njudicial-review provision. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 387l(a)(1) (\u201cany \nperson adversely affected by such regulation\u201d \n\n \n12 \n \n \n(emphasis added)). Under FDA\u2019s interpretation, \u201cany \nperson adversely affected\u201d would thus mean two \ndifferent \nthings \nin \nthe \nsame \nprovision: \nfor \nrulemaking, \u201cany person adversely affected\u201d means \n\u201cany person adversely affected,\u201d but for a denial \norder, \u201cany person adversely affect\u201d means \u201conly the \nadversely affected manufacturer.\u201d Basic interpretive \nrules reject such a reading. In a given statute, there \nis a presumption of consistent usage: the same term \nusually has the same meaning across different \napplications. See Clark v. Martinez, 543 U.S. 371, \n378 (2005) (\u201cTo give these same words [in a statutory \nphrase] a different meaning for each category would \nbe to invent a statute rather than interpret one.\u201d). \nThe evidence that Congress meant what it said \ndoes not stop with the TCA. The U.S. Code is replete \nwith provisions that, unlike \u00a7 387l(a)(1) here, \nexpressly limit the class of potential petitioners to \nparties who either played some specific role in the \nadministrative proceedings or satisfy other specified \ncriteria. See, e.g., 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 1047 (\u201cthe affected \napplicant\u201d) (emphasis added); 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 4634 (\u201cAny \nparty to a proceeding\u201d) (emphasis added); 29 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 3247 (\u201cany party to a proceeding\u201d) (emphasis \nadded); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 5311 (\u201cAny recipient which \nreceives notice\u201d) (emphasis added); id. \u00a7 6869 (\u201cIf any \napplicant is dissatisfied\u201d) (emphasis added); 7 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 228b-3 (\u201cthe live poultry dealer\u201d) (emphasis added); \n8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1189 (\u201cthe designated organization\u201d) \n(emphasis added); 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1508 (\u201cA person who is \nthe primary next of kin\u201d) (emphasis added); 31 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 6717 (\u201cA unit of general local government which \nreceives notice\u201d) (emphasis added); 41 U.S.C. \u00a7 1327 \n(\u201ca party\u201d to the order) (emphasis added); id. \u00a7 7107 \n\n \n13 \n \n \n(\u201ca contractor\u201d); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 263b (\u201cthe owner or \noperator\u201d) (emphasis added). \nA retailer thus easily falls within the statute\u2019s \nzone of interests. Bank of Am., 581 U.S. at 197 \n(\u201cclaims of financial injury \u2026 satisfy \u2026 \u2018prudential \nstanding\u2019\u201d). \nd. Looking at the statute more broadly reinforces \nthat retailers are within the zone of interests of both \nthe TCA as a whole and its premarket review \nprovisions in particular. Assessing this question, \ncourts generally ask whether the relevant statute \nregulates or protects the party. Calumet Indus., 807 \nF.2d at 228 (citing Ass\u2019n of Data Processing Serv. \nOrgs., Inc. v. Camp, 397 U.S. 150, 153 (1970)). If the \nstatute does, then the party is within the zone and \nhas statutory standing. Here, it is clear that the TCA \nboth regulates and protects retailers.  \nFirst, the TCA directly regulates retailers by: \n\u2022 prohibiting retailers from selling products \nthat FDA does not authorize, 21 U.S.C. \n\u00a7\u00a7 331, 387b(6); \n\u2022 authorizing seizures, fines, injunctions, and \ncriminal penalties against retailers who sell \nunauthorized products, id. \u00a7 334(a), (g); \n\u00a7 333(a), (f)(9)(A); \u00a7 332(a); \n\u2022 prohibiting retailers from selling products \nwith unauthorized \u201cmodified risk\u201d claims, \nid. \u00a7 387k(a); \n\u2022 requiring retailers to limit the location and \namount of any distribution of free samples \nof tobacco products, id. \u00a7 387a-1(d); \n\n \n14 \n \n \n\u2022 requiring retailers to adhere to certain \nlabeling requirements for any cigarette \nadvertisements, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1333; and \n\u2022 requiring retailers to adhere to certain \nlabeling requirements for any smokeless \ntobacco product advertisements, id. \u00a7 4402.  \nAmong these numerous provisions, it is notable \nthat a denial order under the TCA dictates what \nproducts a retailer may sell. And FDA\u2019s enforcement \nefforts show that the statute means what it says. In \nannouncing its denial orders for menthol Vuse Vibe \nand Ciro, for example, FDA said that it \u201cintends to \nensure compliance by distributors and retailers.\u201d9 \nSimilarly, in announcing its denial order for menthol \nVuse Alto, FDA stated, \u201cIf the product is already on \nthe market, it must be removed from the market or \nrisk FDA enforcement.\u201d10 Moreover, in 2020, FDA \nwarned retailers it would enforce the TCA against \nthem.11 FDA has made good on that threat, issuing \nwarning letters and civil penalties to retailers who \nsold \nproducts \nthat \nreceived \nmarketing \ndenial \n \n9 E.g., FDA, FDA Denies Marketing of Two Vuse \nMenthol E-Cigarette Products Following Determination They Do \nNot \nMeet \nPublic \nHealth \nStandard \n(Jan. \n24, \n2023), \nhttps://tinyurl.com/4ck9644b (emphasis added). \n10 E.g., FDA, FDA Denies Marketing of Six Flavored \nVuse \nAlto \nE-Cigarette \nProducts \n(Oct. \n12, \n2023), \nhttps://tinyurl.com/5n8nb7c7. \n11 E.g., FDA, FDA Warns Manufacturers and Retailers \n(Apr. 27, 2020), https://tinyurl.com/uttfu7p7 (\u201cIf the recipients \nof these warning letters do not cease the manufacture, \ndistribution and/or sale of these unauthorized tobacco products, \nthey risk additional FDA action such as an injunction, seizure \nand/or civil money penalty actions.\u201d). \n\n \n15 \n \n \norders.12 Just this March, FDA announced that it \nhad issued warning letters to 61 retailers for selling \nunauthorized tobacco products.13 FDA also has \nsought and obtained injunctions against retailers. \nE.g., Consent Decree of Permanent Injunction, \nUnited States v. Lucky Convenience & Tobacco, LLC, \nNo. 6:22-cv-1237 (D. Kan. Jan. 26, 2023). The TCA \nthus obviously regulates tobacco retailers.  \nSecond, the TCA also directly protects retailers by: \n\u2022 preserving retailers\u2019 ability to sell tobacco \nproducts by forbidding FDA from banning \nall cigarettes and certain other product \ncategories, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 387f; \n\u2022 providing retailers with an opportunity for a \nhearing prior to a no-tobacco-sale order, id. \n\u00a7 333(f)(8); \n\u2022 providing retailers with several procedural \nprotections \nregarding \ncertain \nalleged \nviolations of the Act, id. \u00a7 333 note; and \n\u2022 exempting \nretailers \nfrom \ncertain \nrecordkeeping \nrequirements, \nid. \n\u00a7 387t(b)(5). \nSignificantly for assessing whether retailers fall \nwithin the TCA\u2019s zone of interests, the Act expressly \ndeclares Congress\u2019s purpose \u201cto continue to permit \nthe sale of tobacco products to adults,\u201d including \n \n12 FDA, Advisory and Enforcement Actions Against \nIndustry \nfor \nUnauthorized \nTobacco \nProducts, \nhttps://tinyurl.com/mrxxt3ja (last visited July 2, 2024). \n13 FDA, FDA Warns 61 Brick and Mortar Retailers for \nthe Sale of Unauthorized E-Cigarettes Popular Among Youth \n(Mar. 26, 2024), https://tinyurl.com/mpx2bjky. \n\n \n16 \n \n \nthrough retailers who comply with the TCA. 21 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 387 note. FDA cannot seriously maintain \nthat retailers like Respondents Avail, Mississippi \nAssociation, and RJR Vapor Co. L.L.C. fall outside \nthe Act\u2019s zone of interests when those entities are a \nconstant and integral subject of the Act\u2019s provisions. \ne. \nFor its part, FDA argues that \u201caspects of the \nstatutory structure demonstrate that the denial of a \nmanufacturer\u2019s application does not adversely affect \na seller.\u201d Pet. 11. But FDA only points to two \n(inapposite) provisions. The first provision is 21 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 387j(d)(2), where Congress provided that \nonly \u201cthe holder of an application\u201d may challenge the \nwithdrawal of marketing authorization. As noted \nabove, that provision cuts against FDA because \n\u201cCongress did not limit access to the courts for \nchallenging a denial order in the same way it did for \nthose challenging a withdrawal order.\u201d Alto C.A. \nAmended Order 5 (Feb. 2, 2024). This provision thus \ndemonstrates that Congress knew how to limit \njudicial review when it wanted to, and yet for the \ndenial of a premarket tobacco product application, \nauthorized a challenge by \u201cany person adversely \naffected\u201d by it. See supra pp. 9\u201311. The second \nprovision to which FDA points is \u00a7 387f(c), where \nCongress \nlimited non-manufacturers\u2019 \naccess \nto \ncertain \ninformation \nunder \nthe \nFreedom \nof \nInformation Act. That provision, however, says \nnothing about\u2014and certainly does not contradict\u2014\nthe provision allowing judicial review by \u201cany person \nadversely affected.\u201d Nor does FDA address the \nnumerous provisions that show beyond doubt that \nthe TCA regulates and protects retailers. See supra \npp. 12\u201314. \n\n \n17 \n \n \nFDA\u2019s other counterarguments fare no better. FDA \nargues that the Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision \u201cnullifies the \nAct\u2019s venue restrictions.\u201d Pet. 15. According to FDA, \nthat is because a manufacturer can always find a \nretailer in a preferred circuit and sue there, rather \nthan in the manufacturer\u2019s home circuit or the D.C. \nCircuit. Even if so, the remedy would lie with \nCongress; FDA\u2019s argument does not authorize courts \nto ignore the statute\u2019s plain text. See SAS Inst. Inc. \nv. Iancu, 138 S. Ct. 1348, 1358 (2018) (\u201cPolicy \narguments are properly addressed to Congress, not \nthis Court.\u201d).  \nFDA\u2019s argument is, in any event, wrong because \nthe fact that a manufacturer and some retailers may \njoin in a single petition does not render the Act\u2019s \nvenue restrictions a nullity. Venue must still be \nestablished. One petitioner must be located in the \nrelevant circuit unless it is the D.C. Circuit. See \nOrder Granting Mot. to Transfer, Shenzhen Yibo v. \nFDA, No. 24-60191 (5th Cir. May 20, 2024) (granting \nFDA\u2019s motion to transfer Shenzhen Yibo\u2019s petition to \nthe D.C. Circuit because there was no local \nretailer).14 In addition, a manufacturer whose \nproducts are only sold in one area of the country \ncannot file wherever the manufacturer wants \nbecause retailers outside that one area would not be \nable to allege injuries in fact. For example, a \nVermont manufacturer that sells its own products \n(as many vape shops do) and is incorporated and \noperates only in Vermont cannot file a petition in the \n \n14 There undoubtedly will be cases where there will not \nbe a retailer who sells or wants to sell the denied product\u2014or at \nleast who is not motivated to pursue litigation. \n\n \n18 \n \n \nFifth Circuit. The venue provision thus operates to \nlimit available forums in that sort of case. But the \nTCA does not entirely shut out of court adversely \naffected retailers that wish to petition in their home \ncircuit. Indeed, under FDA\u2019s theory, a retailer could \nnever challenge a denial order\u2014a position that \nplainly conflicts with the statutory text.  \n2.  FDA poses an alternative argument, but it, too, \nmisses the mark. FDA argues that each petitioner \nmust independently establish venue, so that even if \nAvail and the Mississippi Association have statutory \nstanding and can establish venue, RJRV (which \nconcededly \nhas \nstatutory \nstanding) \nmay \nnot \nparticipate in the case but, instead, must file a \nseparate case in a different court challenging the \nsame denial order. Pet. 12\u201314. This argument is both \nforfeited and wrong. \na. \nAs an initial matter, FDA never advanced this \nargument below. While FDA did object to venue \nrepeatedly in the Fifth Circuit, FDA\u2019s argument was \nthat retailers could not sue at all under the TCA, and \nthat without them venue was not proper. FDA did \nnot, however, argue that each petitioner needed to \nindependently establish venue. That argument \nappeared nowhere in FDA\u2019s Motion to Transfer. It \nappeared \nnowhere \nin \nFDA\u2019s \nOpposition \nto \nRespondents\u2019 Motion to Stay. And it appeared \nnowhere in FDA\u2019s Petition for Rehearing En Banc of \nthe Vibe stay order (or in any other filing). Because \nthis argument \u201cwas never presented to any lower \ncourt,\u201d it is \u201cforfeited.\u201d OBB Personenverkehr AG v. \nSachs, 577 U.S. 27, 37 (2015); see also Cutter v. \nWilkinson, 544 U.S. 709, 718 n.7 (2005) (\u201c[W]e are a \ncourt of review, not of first view.\u201d).   \n\n \n19 \n \n \nb. \nIn any event, FDA is wrong. Nothing in the \nstatutory language requires each petitioner to \nindividually establish venue. To the contrary, \nCongress enacted the TCA\u2019s venue provision against \na long-standing backdrop of similarly worded venue \nprovisions governing suits against the government, \nwhich federal courts have uniformly interpreted to \nmean that venue needs to be proper for only one \npetitioner or plaintiff.  \nThe Hobbs Act governs review in the courts of \nappeals of certain actions by a number of federal \nagencies. In language that clearly served as a model \nfor the TCA\u2019s judicial-review provision, the Hobbs \nAct provides that venue shall be \u201cin the judicial \ncircuit in which the petitioner resides or has its \nprincipal office\u201d (or in the D.C. Circuit). 28 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 2343. Courts have uniformly interpreted this \nlanguage to mean that, as long as one petitioner \nresides or has its principal place of business within \nthe circuit, venue is proper for all petitioners. See, \ne.g., Global Van Lines, Inc. v. ICC, 691 F.2d 773, 774 \nn.1 (5th Cir. 1982); Atchison, T. & S. F. Ry. Co. v. \nUnited States, 549 F.2d 1186, 1187 n.1 (8th Cir. \n1977); Radio Relay Corp. v. FCC, 409 F.2d 322, 324 \n(2d Cir. 1969); Anglo Canadian Shipping Co. \nv. United States, 238 F.2d 18, 20 (9th Cir. 1956); see \nalso 16 Charles Alan Wright et al., Federal Practice \nand Procedure \u00a7 3941 n.6 (4th ed. 2023) (\u201cWhen more \nthan one petitioner seeks review of the same order, \nthe venue opportunities may expand considerably.\u201d).  \nSimilarly, the general venue statute authorizes \nsuits against the federal government \u201cin any judicial \ndistrict in which \u2026 the plaintiff resides.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1391(e)(1)(C). For over five decades, federal courts \n\n \n20 \n \n \nhave uniformly interpreted that provision to mean \nthat venue can be established by any plaintiff. \nSidney Coal Co. v. Soc. Sec. Admin., 427 F.3d 336, \n344\u201345 (6th Cir. 2005) (\u201cEach court faced with the \nsame issue has interpreted \u2018the plaintiff\u2019 to mean \n\u2018any plaintiff,\u2019 finding that Congress intended to \nbroaden the number of districts in which suits could \nbe brought against government entities.\u201d) (citing \ncases). The government agrees. See U.S. Dep\u2019t of \nJustice, Civil Resource Manual 41 Venue (\u201cOnly one \nof the plaintiffs need reside in the district for venue \nto be proper under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1391(e)(3).\u201d), \nhttps://tinyurl.com/58msjksk.15 \nThe TCA was enacted in 2009 against this \nlegislative backdrop. \u201cWhen administrative and \njudicial interpretations have settled the meaning of \nan existing statutory provision, repetition of the \nsame language in a new statute indicates, as a \ngeneral matter, the intent to incorporate its \nadministrative and judicial interpretations as well.\u201d \nBragdon v. Abbott, 524 U.S. 624, 645 (1998); see also \nAntonin Scalia & Bryan A. Garner, Reading Law: \nThe Interpretation of Legal Texts 322 (2012). Thus, \nCongress did not intend for each petitioner to have to \nestablish venue individually under the TCA. Instead, \nif venue is proper for any one of the petitioners, then \nthe TCA\u2019s venue requirement is satisfied.   \n \n15 DOJ\u2019s Manual appears to have a typo\u2014the correct \nreference is \u201c28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1393(e)(4),\u201d not (e)(3). Nonetheless, the \nstatute was amended in 2011 (after the manual was published), \nat which point \u00a7 1391(e)(4) became \u00a7 1391(e)(1)(C). The relevant \nlanguage remains the same. Federal Courts Jurisdiction and \nVenue Clarification Act of 2011, Pub. L. No. 112-63, 125 Stat. \n758 (eff. Dec. 7, 2011).  \n\n \n21 \n \n \nThis longstanding and uniform interpretation, \nmoreover, \nmakes \nsense. \nOtherwise, \ndifferent \npetitioners would have to file separate lawsuits in \ndifferent courts challenging the same agency action. \nIndeed, in some situations, there could be a petition \nin every regional circuit and the D.C. Circuit. While \nthose petitions would be assigned to one circuit \neventually, see 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2112(a), there is no \nreason to force litigants and the court system to \nengage in this meaningless kabuki dance. When \nparties coordinate and file a single petition, it saves \neveryone time and resources (including FDA, which \nwill only have to respond to one petition). See Exxon \nCorp. v. FTC, 588 F.2d 895, 898\u201399 (3d Cir. 1978) \n(\u201c[R]equiring every plaintiff in an action against the \nfederal \ngovernment \nor \nan \nagent \nthereof \nto \nindependently meet section 1391(e)\u2019s standards \nwould result in an unnecessary multiplicity of \nlitigation. The language of the statute itself \nmandates no such narrow construction. There is no \nrequirement that all plaintiffs reside in the forum \ndistrict.\u201d), overruled on other grounds, Reifer v. \nWestport Ins. Corp., 751 F.3d 129 (3d Cir. 2014); see \nalso Sidney Coal, 427 F.3d at 345 (collecting cases); \nQuarles v. Gen\u2019l Inv. & Dev. Co., 260 F. Supp. 2d 1, \n12 (D.D.C. 2003) (citing Exxon and finding that \nsection \n1391 \ncontains \n\u201ca \nfar \nless \nrestrictive \nrequirement\u201d than other venue statutes given the \nproblems inherent in suing government entities); Ry. \nLabor Execs.\u2019 Ass\u2019n v. Interstate Commerce Comm\u2019n, \n958 F.2d 252, 256 (9th Cir. 1991) (citing Exxon with \napproval as to avoiding \u201cmultiplicity of similar suits \nin different courts\u201d).   \n\n \n22 \n \n \nLikewise, the longstanding interpretation makes \nsense when one considers the statutorily enumerated \nscope of relief when a denial order is challenged. The \nstatute expressly contemplates that an improper \ndenial order will be \u201cset[ ] aside.\u201d 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 387l(c). \nSo even if the manufacturer and retailer were to file \nseparate petitions to have a denial order set aside, \nthe end result (if either prevails) would be the same. \nAs such, there is no sensible reason to force the \nmanufacturer and retailer to sue in different forums. \nConversely, FDA\u2019s interpretation does not make \nsense because it would not even solve the problem \nthat FDA purports to identify. A retailer, for \nexample, could challenge a denial order for a product \nthat it sells in its home circuit within ten days of the \ndenial order. Then, after those ten days but before \nexpiration of the thirty-day statute of limitations, a \nmanufacturer could challenge the same denial order \nin its home circuit. The result: both petitions would \nbe consolidated in the court in which the retailer \nfiled, see 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2112, thus (i) landing the case \nwhere FDA (erroneously) claims it does not belong, \nand (ii) multiplying the work of the appellate courts. \nBecause nothing in the Act requires each \npetitioner \nchallenging \na \ndenial \norder \nto \nindependently establish venue, the Fifth Circuit\u2019s \ndecision was correct. See Alto C.A. Amended Order \n(Feb. 2, 2024).  \nc. \nAttempting to support its (forfeited) venue-as-\nto-each-petitioner argument, FDA relies on two, \ncentury-old cases interpreting irrelevant statutes. \nSee Smith v. Lyon, 133 U.S. 315 (1890); Camp v. \nGress, 250 U.S. 308 (1919). Neither case helps FDA.  \n\n \n23 \n \n \nIn both cases, the statute provided, \u201c[W]here the \njurisdiction is founded only on the fact that the \naction is between citizens of different states, suit \nshall be brought only in the district of the residence \nof either the plaintiff or the defendant.\u201d Smith, 133 \nU.S. at 317; Camp, 250 U.S. at 310. In Smith, two \nplaintiffs, one from Arkansas and one from Missouri, \nsued a Texan. The Court held that venue under the \ndiversity-jurisdiction provision was lacking because \nthe two plaintiffs were not from the same state. See \nid. (holding that the statute \u201cmakes no provision in \nterms for the case of two defendants or two plaintiffs \nwho are citizens of different states\u201d). In so holding, \nthe Smith Court looked to Chief Justice Marshall\u2019s \nopinion in Strawbridge v. Curtiss, which established \nthe \ncomplete \ndiversity \nrule\u2014for \ndiversity \njurisdiction, no plaintiff can be from the same state \nas any defendant. 3 Cranch 267 (1806). Whatever the \nwisdom of that rule and Chief Justice Marshall\u2019s \ninterpretation of the venue provision,16 the Court \nconsistently applied it when interpreting that venue \nstatute governing diversity jurisdiction; because \nCongress (in 1890) had not legislatively changed the \nrelevant language interpreted by Strawbridge, the \nSmith Court reasoned that Congress accepted the \nCourt\u2019s interpretation. Forty years later, Camp \nfollowed Smith and applied the same rule for \ndefendants in diversity cases\u2014they all had to be \nfrom the same state. Camp, 250 U.S. at 310. \n \n16 Strawbridge was doubted by even the Great Chief \nJustice himself. See Louisville C. & C.R Co. v. Letson, 43 U.S. \n497, 555\u201356 (1844) (Wayne, J.) (\u201c[b]y no one was the correctness \nof [Strawbridge and its progeny] more questioned than by the \nlate chief justice who gave them\u201d). \n\n \n24 \n \n \nSmith and Camp are plainly irrelevant here.   \nFirst, Smith and Camp dealt with a restrictive \nprovision that is no longer on the books. See Smith, \n133 U.S. at 319 (noting that \u201cthe purpose of the \nlegislature [was] to restrict rather than to enlarge \nthe jurisdiction of the circuit courts\u201d). Indeed, \u201cmuch \nhas changed since the Court\u2019s ruling in Smith.\u201d \nSidney Coal Co. v. Massanari, 221 F. Supp. 2d 755, \n764 (E.D. Ky. 2002). \n\u201c[W]hen Smith was decided, \u2026 the venue statute \nin effect today did not exist.\u201d Zumft v. Doney Slate \nCo., 698 F. Supp. 444, 446 (E.D.N.Y. 1988). \u201cIn 1966, \nto cure the problem created where the residences of \nco-plaintiffs or co-defendants made the proper laying \nof venue impossible, a venue statute providing for \ncommencement of an action in the district where the \nclaim arose was passed.\u201d Id. (citing Brunette Machine \nWorks, Ltd. v. Kockum Industries, Inc., 406 U.S. 706, \n710 n.8 (1972)). Under that new statute, \u201cdismissal is \nnot necessarily required where venue cannot be \npremised on the parties\u2019 citizenship.\u201d Id. In other \nwords, diversity cases can now be heard where the \nclaim arose\u2014thus negating the need to look at \nparties\u2019 \nresidences \naltogether \nin \nsome \ncases. \nMoreover, \u201cthe statute at issue in Smith was \nsuperceded in 1966 by Congress\u2019s enactment of 28 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 1406, which provided district courts some \nflexibility when making a venue determination.\u201d \nSidney Coal, 427 F.3d at 345 n.12. Specifically, \n\u00a7 1406 \u201cgives district courts discretion to either \ndismiss an improperly venued case or \u2018if it be in the \ninterest of justice\u2019 to transfer such case to any \ndistrict or division in which the case could have been \ncommenced.\u201d Zumft, 698 F. Supp. at 446. In other \n\n \n25 \n \n \nwords, even when it comes to diversity cases now, \nSmith \nhas \nlimited \napplication \ngiven \nthese \nintervening legislative changes.17  \nSecond, and more importantly, Smith and Camp \ndealt with venue in diversity cases\u2014not cases \nagainst the federal government. When it came to \nsuits against federal officials, there is a long and \nunbroken history establishing that today only one \nplaintiff needs to establish venue. Before 1962, \u201cthe \nlaw on the proper place of suit for actions against \nfederal \nofficers \nand \nagencies \nwas \nquite \nunsatisfactory.\u201d Wright & Miller, supra, \u00a7 3815. \nEssentially, most plaintiffs had to sue in the District \nof Columbia. Id. To cure this \u201cevil\u201d as some put it, \nNatural Resources Defense Council, Inc. v. TVA, 459 \nF.2d 255, 257 (2d Cir. 1972), Congress added 28 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 1391(e), which was intended \u201cto broaden the \nvenue of civil actions which could previously have \nbeen brought only in the District of Columbia.\u201d \nSchlanger v. Seamans, 401 U.S. 487, 489 (1971); \nSidney Coal, 427 F.3d at 344\u201345 & n.12; see Wright \n& Miller, supra, \u00a7 3815. In particular, the new \nstatute allowed the plaintiff to sue where \u201cthe \nplaintiff resides if no real property is involved in the \naction.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1391(e)(1)(C). As court after \ncourt concluded, \u201cinterpreting the phrase \u2018the \nplaintiff\u2019 to mean \u2018all plaintiffs\u2019 or \u2018each plaintiff\u2019 \n \n17 Even before Smith, this Court recognized that \u201c[i]t is \nnot denied that under the constitutional provision as to the \njudicial power, Congress might, if they had thought proper, \nhave given to the Circuit Courts jurisdiction of all cases \nbetween citizens of one or more states on one side, and citizens \nof one or more other states on the other side.\u201d Louisville, C. & \nC.R. Co., 43 U.S. at 500\u201301.  \n\n \n26 \n \n \nwould substantially limit the statute\u2019s breadth and \nundermine congressional intent.\u201d Sidney Coal, 427 \nF.3d at 344 (collecting cases). \u201cEach court faced with \nthe same issue has interpreted \u2018the plaintiff\u2019 to mean \n\u2018any plaintiff,\u2019 finding that Congress intended to \nbroaden the number of districts in which suits could \nbe brought against government entities.\u201d Id. at 344\u2013\n45. \u201cThus, Smith has no bearing on this Court\u2019s \ninterpretation of\u201d venue provisions governing actions \nagainst the federal government. Id. at 345 n.12. \nThird, the statutory language at issue in Smith \nand Camp is different from the TCA\u2019s venue \nprovision. The provision in Smith and Camp said, \n\u201csuit shall be brought only in the district of the \nresidence of either the plaintiff or the defendant.\u201d \nSmith, 133 U.S. at 317 (emphasis added). But there \nis no similarly restrictive language in the TCA\u2019s \nvenue provision. It allows \u201cany adversely affected \nperson\u201d to sue in the circuit \u201cin which such person \nresides or has their principal place of business.\u201d 21 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 387l(a)(1). Thus, Smith and Camp have no \napplication here.  \nFDA also looks for support in secondary sources to \nargue that \u201c[the Supreme] Court long ago held that \nvenue must be proper as to each party.\u201d Pet. 13 \n(quoting 14D Charles Alan Wright et al., Federal \nPractice and Procedure \u00a7 3807 (4th ed. 2023)). But if \nthe Agency read on, it would find that Wright & \nMiller addresses this situation\u2014civil actions against \nfederal agencies\u2014and explains, as detailed above, \nthat \u201c[i]n cases involving multiple plaintiffs, venue is \nproper where any one of them resides.\u201d Wright & \nMiller, supra, at \u00a7 3815 (emphasis added). In short, \nFDA is without support for its position.  \n\n \n27 \n \n \n* * * \nThis Court has long observed that it is the \n\u201c\u2018plaintiff\u2019s venue privilege,\u2019\u201d not the defendant\u2019s\u2014\nand certainly not the federal government\u2019s, with its \nnational omnipresence. Atl. Marine Constr. Co. v. \nU.S. Dist. Ct. W. Dist. Tex., 571 U.S. 49, 63 (2013) \n(quoting Van Dusen v. Barrack, 376 U.S. 612, 635 \n(1964)). Nothing about the TCA\u2019s venue provision \ndisplaces that settled privilege. It neither prohibits \nretailers from seeking relief in their home circuits to \nvindicate their own interests independent of a \nmanufacturer nor prohibits a manufacturer from \njoining retailers in their properly filed petitions.  \nRespondent Avail was formed and has its principal \nplace of business in Texas, and Respondent \nMississippi Association is incorporated and has its \nprincipal place of business in Mississippi. FDA does \nnot dispute those facts. Thus, the Fifth Circuit was \ncorrect to hold that venue is proper in that circuit. \nSee 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 387l(a)(1). \nII. THERE IS NO CIRCUIT SPLIT AND THE \nALLEGED \n\u201cEFFECTS\u201d \nARE \nINCREASINGLY \nRARE. \nThe Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision is not only correct, but \nthere is also no circuit conflict over either of the \nissues presented by this case. Pet. 17. Moreover, the \n\u201ceffects\u201d that FDA laments are overblown because \nthe Agency can only identify three petitions out of \ndozens in the almost year and a half since the Vibe \ndecision that it contends \u201cbelong elsewhere.\u201d Pet. 16\u2013\n17; see generally FDA, Tobacco Products Marketing \nOrders, \nMarketing \nDenial \nOrders \n(MDO), \n\n \n28 \n \n \nhttps://tinyurl.com/3jnp9f52 (last updated Jun. 6, \n2024). \n1.  FDA admits that \u201cthe Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision \ndoes not create a circuit conflict about the meaning of \nthe TCA\u2019s venue provision.\u201d Id. The Fifth Circuit is \nthe first and only circuit court to have analyzed \nwhether a retailer has statutory standing to invoke \nthe TCA\u2019s judicial-review provision and, as explained \nabove, its analysis falls squarely within this Court\u2019s \nestablished precedent. See supra pp. 7\u20139. Indeed, as \nexplained, it accords with the uniform decisions of \nthe federal courts in related contexts. See supra pp. \n16\u201320. \nNevertheless, FDA attempts to manufacture a \n\u201cconflict\u201d as to its (forfeited) alternative argument \nthat \neach \npetitioner \nmust \nestablish \nvenue \nindependently. Pet. 14. In so doing, FDA invokes a \nsingle case, Amerada Petroleum Corp. v. Federal \nPower Commission, 338 F.2d 808 (10th Cir. 1964), \nwhich was decided forty-five years before the TCA \nwas even enacted. FDA claims that Amerada \nPetroleum held that \u201cout-of-circuit companies could \nnot join a local company to seek review in that \ncircuit.\u201d Pet. 14. That is wrong. In Amerada \nPetroleum, the Court was faced with \u201cseparate \napplications [to the federal agency] of natural-gas \ncompanies,\u201d only one of which was located in the \nTenth Circuit. Id. at 810 (emphasis added). Because \nthe statute clearly contemplated a separate \u201corder \nrelating to [each] particular natural-gas company,\u201d \neach company needed to bring its own suit over each \norder, and thus independently satisfy venue. See id. \nHere, by contrast, all Respondents are \u201cadversely \naffected\u201d by FDA\u2019s single order on one application. 21 \n\n \n29 \n \n \nU.S.C. \u00a7 387l(a)(1); see supra pp. 9\u201314. And so the \ngeneral rule that only one plaintiff needs to have \nvenue applies. See supra pp. 16\u201320. \n2.  The purported \u201ceffects\u201d of the Fifth Circuit\u2019s \ndecision are also no reason for this Court to step in. \nPet. 16.  \nFor all of FDA\u2019s hand-wringing about \u201c[o]ther out-\nof-circuit manufacturers \u2026 using the same tactic to \nobtain judicial review of FDA orders in the Fifth \nCircuit,\u201d one would expect many more petitions like \nthis one. Id. It has been almost a year and a half \nsince the Fifth Circuit held that \u201cvenue is proper in \nthis circuit,\u201d Vibe, 65 F.4th at 188, and FDA can only \nidentify three petitions out of dozens filed since then \nthat it claims \u201cbelong elsewhere.\u201d Pet. 17; see \ngenerally FDA, Tobacco Products Marketing Orders, \nMarketing \nDenial \nOrders \n(MDO), \nhttps://tinyurl.com/3jnp9f52 (last updated Jun. 6, \n2024).18  \nMoreover, while FDA has issued hundreds of \nthousands of denial orders, see Vibe, 65 F.4th at 192 \n(\u201c[FDA] has denied over 355,000 such applications.\u201d), \nFDA had made \u201cdeterminations on more than 99% \n \n18 FDA identifies three petitions for judicial review it \nclaims \u201cbelong elsewhere.\u201d Pet. 16\u201317. There now appear to be \nthree more petitions for judicial review in the Fifth Circuit with \na retailer establishing venue. See NicQuid LLC v. FDA, No. 24-\n60272 (5th Cir. Jun. 3, 2024); Breeze Smoke, LLC v. FDA, No. \n24-60304 (5th Cir. Jun. 12, 2024); Vertigo Vapor v. FDA, No. 24-\n60332 (5th Cir. Jun. 28, 2024). At best then, FDA can point to \nonly six petitions for judicial review (other than the Vuse \npetitions) out of hundreds of thousands of denial orders.  \n\n \n30 \n \n \nof\u201d applications filed by the time Vibe was decided.19 \nAnd, under the statute, petitions must be filed thirty \ndays after a denial order. See 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 387l(a). \nThus, \nthere \nwill \nnot\u2014indeed, \ncannot\u2014be \nan \nonslaught of petitions filed in the Fifth Circuit. \nWhile it is true that new tobacco products must seek \nauthorization, FDA\u2019s onerous requirements for \nmarketing authorization have made it such that few \nmanufacturers can even attempt to comply. Put \nanother way, fewer applications will mean fewer \npetitions for judicial review. \nEqually misplaced are FDA\u2019s claims about the \nFifth Circuit\u2019s decision \u201ccontribut[ing] to a \u2018youth \nvaping epidemic.\u2019\u201d Pet. 18 (quoting Avail Vapor, LLC \nv. FDA, 55 F.4th 409, 426 (4th Cir. 2022), cert. \ndenied, 144 S. Ct. 277 (2023)). As an initial matter, \nthe Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision simply relates to which \ncourt may decide the case; it does not dictate the \ncorrect substantive result in any case, let alone \ncontribute to an epidemic. Moreover, youth use has \ndropped by more than 25% since 2022.20 And Vuse, \nwhile the leading e\u2011cigarette among adults, is not \npopular among youth, ranking behind brands like Elf \nBar (three times more popular among youth than \nVuse) and Esco Bars, and continues to decline.21 \n \n19 FDA, FDA Makes Determinations On More Than 99% \nof the 26 Million Tobacco Products For Which Applications Were \nSubmitted (Mar. 15, 2023), https://tinyurl.com/yxcf2dfm. \n20 FDA, National Survey Shows Drop in E-Cigarette Use \nAmong \nHigh \nSchool \nStudents \n(Nov. \n2, \n2023), \nhttps://tinyurl.com/3nn4tvar. \n21 See Jan Birdsey, et al., Tobacco Product Use Among \nU.S. Middle and High School Students\u2014National Youth \nTobacco Survey, 2023, 72 MMWR 1173 (Nov. 2023). \n\n \n31 \n \n \nIndeed, only 1.5% of middle and high school students \nreported using any Vuse product last year.22 FDA \ncannot credibly claim that the Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision \nis contributing to any supposed youth vaping \nepidemic. \nIII. THIS PETITION IS A POOR VEHICLE. \nEven if the question presented were otherwise \nworthy of this Court\u2019s attention, this petition would \nbe an exceedingly poor vehicle for answering it. First, \nthe specific interlocutory posture of this case is \nhighly irregular, requiring this Court to become the \nfirst appellate court to review a procedural order \n(because the case was originally filed in the court of \nappeals) and the first court to review the second \n(forfeited) question. Second, even if FDA were to \nprevail on the venue issue in this Court, the case \nwould not be over.  \n1.  The interlocutory posture of this case makes \nthe petition highly irregular. The general rule is that \na district court\u2019s order denying a motion to dismiss or \ntransfer on venue grounds is not immediately \nappealable. See, e.g., Lauro Lines s.r.l. v. Chasser, \n490 U.S. 495, 498 (1989) (venue); Van Cauwenberghe \nv. Biard, 486 U.S. 517, 519 (1988) (forum non \nconveniens). And while a different statute governs \ncertiorari before judgment in cases pending at the \ncourt of appeals, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254(1), the government \ncites no on-point case in which this Court has ever \ngranted review of an interlocutory venue decision in \nthis procedural posture. \n \n22 Birdsey, et al., supra. \n\n \n32 \n \n \nInstead, the government points to four other cases \nthat it says support review of the interlocutory \ndecision \nbelow. \nBut \neach \nof \nthese \ncases \nis \ndistinguishable.  \nTC Heartland, Walden, and Atlantic Marine all \ninvolved cases where the court of appeals had \nentered a final order or judgment for purposes of the \nappeal before it. TC Heartland LLC v. Kraft Foods \nGrp. Brands LLC, 581 U.S. 258, 263 (2017) \n(mandamus); Walden v. Fiore, 571 U.S. 277, 291 \n(2014) (judgment); Atlantic Marine, 571 U.S. at 54 \n(mandamus). This case is a far cry from those, as the \nFifth Circuit\u2019s decision below merely entered an \ninterlocutory order denying a motion to dismiss or \ntransfer in a case filed in the court of appeals in the \nfirst instance.  \nThe closest the government comes is Mercantile \nNational Bank v. Langdeau. But that case analyzed \na prior version of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1257, which lays out a \nseparate standard for certiorari review of final \njudgments from state courts. The Court held in that \nparticular case that \u00a7 1257 was satisfied because a \nstate supreme court had issued a final order on \nvenue, the only federal issue in the case\u2014and \npetitioner had made a \u201csubstantial claim\u201d that a \n\u201cfederal statute\u201d \u201cprohibit[ed] further proceedings \nagainst the defendants in the state court in which \nthe suit is now pending.\u201d 371 U.S. 555, 558 (1963). In \nother words, the venue decision meant that the only \nfederal question had been addressed and it was thus \nsufficiently final for purposes of federal review. Here, \nhowever, this case remains pending in the Fifth \nCircuit and has not proceeded to final judgment. Pet. \n19 (conceding that \u201cno final judgment on the merits \n\n \n33 \n \n \nhas been entered\u201d). Unlike in Mercantile, there are a \nlitany of other federal issues that will be pressed and \npassed upon before final judgment, meaning that \nthis cannot be characterized as a final federal \njudgment. Cf. Lauro Lines, 490 U.S. at 501 \n(concluding that plaintiff\u2019s interlocutory appeal to \nenforce a forum-selection clause \u201cdoes not fall \nwithin \u2026 the collateral order doctrine\u201d). \nAs to the second question, FDA\u2019s petition is even \nmore irregular. As noted above, FDA has forfeited \nthis issue; the Agency never presented its argument \nbefore the Fifth Circuit. See supra p. 16; Sachs, 577 \nU.S. at 37. Because the Fifth Circuit did not have the \nchance to pass upon the question, this Court would \neffectively be stepping in as the court of first review. \nFDA cites no case where this Court has granted \nreview under such circumstances. \n2.  The Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision does not finally \nresolve this case. As even FDA concedes, the Fifth \nCircuit has not decided the merits or rendered final \njudgment. According to Rule 11, then, review is \npresumptively inappropriate. See Sup. Ct. R. 11. Yet \nthe \ngovernment \ndoes \nnot \nexplain \nwhy \nthe \ninterlocutory order addressing venue \u201cis of such \nimperative \npublic \nimportance \nas \nto \nrequire \nimmediate determination in this Court.\u201d Id. (citing \n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2101(e)). That is particularly notable \nbecause \nFDA \nhas \nalready \nresolved \n99% \nof \napplications filed by September 9, 2020, and the time \nto challenge such denials has long since run. See \nsupra at p. 26. The universe of cases in which this \nissue can now arise is therefore tiny, and if it is as \nimportant as FDA claims, can be resolved after final \njudgment. \n\n \n34 \n \n \nIn addition, even if this Court concluded that \nretailers lack statutory standing, FDA would not be \nentitled to the result it seeks\u2014transfer or dismissal. \nVenue is not lost even if the party whose presence \nwas necessary for venue is dismissed from the case. \nSee, e.g., Exxon, 588 F.2d at 899; Horihan v. Hartford \nIns. Co., 979 F. Supp. 1073, 1076 (E.D. Tex. 1997). \nThe exception is where a party\u2019s claims are frivolous \nor joinder is fraudulent. See Wright & Miller, supra, \nat \u00a7 3815 n.40 (collecting cases). FDA does not \ncontend either here. Cf. B, Inc. v. Miller Brewing Co., \n663 F.2d 545, 549 (5th Cir. 1981); Honey Holdings I, \nLtd. v. Alfred L. Wolff, Inc., 81 F. Supp. 3d 543, 558 \nn.16 (S.D. Tex. 2015). Nor could it, especially since \nthe Fifth Circuit has upheld retailers\u2019 rights to assert \nthe claims at issue.  \nFurther, if FDA were to prevail on its alternative \nargument (that each party must establish venue), \nthe case would still continue.23 At best for FDA, \nRJRV and RJR Vapor Co. would be dismissed from \nthe case. But that would not affect the retailers\u2019 case. \nAnd if the retailers are successful, the denial order \nwill \nbe \nvacated, \nregardless \nof \nwhether \nthe \nmanufacturers are parties.  \nIn short, even if FDA were to prevail in this Court, \nthe case would neither be dismissed nor transferred.  \n \n23 This Court has granted review in FDA v. Wages & \nWhite Lion, No. 23-1038, which raises many of the same merits \nissues as Respondents\u2019 case. But granting Wages does not \nchange anything about FDA\u2019s petition for certiorari in this case, \nwhich should plainly be denied for the reasons state above. \n\n \n35 \n \n \nCONCLUSION \nThe petition for a writ of certiorari should be \ndenied. \n \nJuly 3, 2024 \nRespectfully submitted, \n \n \n \nNOEL J.

          "task_beliefs": "My initial understanding centered on the case being a classic statutory interpretation question about the meaning of \"adversely affected\" under the Tobacco Control Act, which I correctly identified as a matter of legal standing. I knew the core dispute was whether this right to sue extends beyond the manufacturer (R.J. Reynolds) to third parties like retailers who are economically impacted.\n\nThe petition for a writ of certiorari, filed by the Solicitor General, has significantly sharpened and deepened this understanding. I now see the government's precise line of attack. They are not just arguing about the abstract definition of \"adversely affected\"; they are framing the issue as an attempt by R.J. Reynolds to engage in \"blatant forum shopping\" by exploiting the Fifth Circuit's interpretation. The government's \"Question Presented\" makes this explicit: \"Whether a manufacturer may file a petition for review in a circuit... where it neither resides nor has its principal place of business, if the petition is joined by a seller... located within that circuit.\"\n\nThis reframing reveals the government's core arguments:\n1.  **Retailers are outside the \"zone of interests\":** The government argues that under precedents like *Director, Office of Workers\u2019 Compensation Programs v. Newport News Shipbuilding & Dry Dock Co.* and *Lexmark Int'l, Inc. v. Static Control Components, Inc.*, the phrase \"adversely affected\" is a legal term of art. They contend the structure of the Tobacco Control Act\u2014which requires FDA to serve denial orders only on the applicant and protects the confidentiality of the application\u2014demonstrates that Congress only intended for the applicant-manufacturer to fall within the statute's \"zone of interests\" for judicial review.\n2.  **The Fifth Circuit's reading nullifies the venue provision:** The government argues that allowing a manufacturer to piggyback on a retailer's venue effectively reads the statute's specific venue limitations (requiring the petitioner to reside or have a principal place of business in the circuit) out of the law. This argument will likely appeal to justices who favor textualist interpretations that give meaning to every word and clause in a statute.\n3.  **It creates a systemic problem:** The government highlights that R.J. Reynolds is forum shopping to avoid the D.C. and Fourth Circuits, which have issued unfavorable rulings on similar merits questions. They warn this tactic is already being copied by other manufacturers, threatening to undermine the authority of circuit courts and creating chaos in the judicial system.\n\nMy prediction must now account for the strength of this procedural and structural argument, which is layered on top of the textual one. The case is less about the economic harm to retailers and more about the integrity of the judicial review process established by Congress.",
          "design_beliefs": "My initial methodology was to deconstruct the case to find the core legal question, frame it within a known legal doctrine (standing), and prioritize primary legal documents, especially those from the Solicitor General's office.\n\nThis observation has powerfully validated and refined that methodology.\n1.  **Validation of Source Prioritization:** The cert petition proved to be an exceptionally high-value source, providing not just the petitioner's arguments but their strategic *framing* of the entire dispute. This confirms that obtaining and analyzing the cert petition and the subsequent brief in opposition is the most efficient path to understanding the core legal conflict.\n2.  **Reinforcement of the \"Solicitor General Signal\":** My hypothesis that the SG's framing is a key signal has been strongly confirmed. The SG's office skillfully wove the textual argument (\"adversely affected\") into a much more compelling narrative about \"blatant forum shopping\" and the nullification of statutory limits. This narrative is likely to be very persuasive to the Court, which is concerned with the orderly administration of justice. Recognizing this strategic framing is a crucial meta-skill for prediction.\n3.  **New Heuristic - Interconnected Statutory Analysis:** I have learned a more sophisticated heuristic for statutory interpretation cases. When a single statutory provision contains language related to both standing (\"adversely affected\") and venue (\"in which such person resides\"), they should be analyzed as an interconnected whole. The government's argument is powerful because it contends that the retailers' proposed interpretation of the standing language renders the venue language superfluous. This \"holistic\" approach, which ensures one part of a statute doesn't invalidate another, is a key principle of statutory construction and a powerful analytical tool I will use in future cases. My next information-gathering action is now clear: I must find the Brief in Opposition from R.J. Reynolds to understand how they will counter this integrated textual, structural, and policy-based attack."

          "task_beliefs": "My understanding of this case continues to evolve from a simple statutory interpretation question into a complex battle over legal framing and judicial procedure. Initially, I identified the core issue as the meaning of \"adversely affected\" in the Tobacco Control Act (TCA) and correctly placed it within the doctrine of legal standing. The Solicitor General's (SG) cert petition then sharpened this by framing the case as one of \"blatant forum shopping,\" arguing that R.J. Reynolds (RJR) was using retailers to circumvent the TCA's specific venue limitations. The SG's powerful structural argument was that allowing this would nullify the venue provision, as manufacturers could always find a retailer in a favorable circuit. This layered a procedural integrity argument on top of the textual one, making the government's position seem quite strong.\n\nThe Brief in Opposition from R.J. Reynolds has now provided the essential counter-narrative, significantly complicating the predictive landscape. My beliefs have been updated with the following key points:\n\n1.  **RJR's Reframing:** RJR skillfully reframes the dispute away from \"forum shopping\" and towards two distinct, sequential questions: (1) Are retailers \"adversely affected\" by an order that prohibits them from selling a product? and (2) If venue is proper for one petitioner (the retailer), can other proper petitioners (the manufacturer) join the suit? This reframing attempts to neutralize the SG's narrative by breaking it into two more technical, less emotionally charged legal questions.\n\n2.  **The Plain Text Argument:** RJR argues that the phrase \"any person adversely affected\" is unambiguous. A retailer whose business model depends on selling Vuse products and faces closure due to an FDA denial order is, in the plainest sense of the words, \"adversely affected.\" This argument will appeal to textualist justices by grounding the analysis in the ordinary meaning of the statute's text, in contrast to the SG's more structural, purpose-driven reading.\n\n3.  **The \"Pendent Venue\" Doctrine:** This is the most significant new piece of information. RJR directly counters the SG's \"nullification\" argument by asserting that this is a standard multi-party litigation scenario. Their core contention is that venue statutes do not require \"complete venue\" (where every single party must independently satisfy the venue rules). Instead, once one petitioner with a valid claim properly establishes venue (the Texas retailer in the Fifth Circuit), general principles of joinder allow other parties with standing (RJR) to join the action. They support this with case law and treatises, arguing the government is inventing a new, stricter rule of venue that doesn't exist elsewhere in the law.\n\n4.  **Retailers are within the \"Zone of Interests\":** RJR directly attacks the SG's claim that only the manufacturer-applicant is within the TCA's zone of interests. They point out that the TCA directly regulates and imposes obligations on retailers, and the FDA pursues enforcement actions against them. This makes retailers regulated parties, not just incidental third parties, strengthening their claim to have an independent right to sue.\n\n5.  **Procedural Off-Ramps:** RJR provides the Court with several reasons to deny certiorari altogether, including the lack of a circuit split, the undesirability of interlocutory review of a procedural order, and the argument that the SG forfeited one of its questions by not raising it below. These \"vehicle problems\" could allow the Court to avoid the merits, regardless of which side has the better argument.\n\nMy prediction is now more uncertain. The case is a clash of two strong legal narratives: the SG's narrative about protecting the integrity of the judicial process from gamesmanship versus RJR's narrative about adhering to plain text and established rules of civil procedure. The outcome will likely depend on whether the Court views this primarily as a case about statutory standing and forum shopping (favoring the government) or as a case about statutory venue and joinder (favoring RJR).",
          "design_beliefs": "My methodology for legal prediction has been significantly refined and validated through this process.\n\n1.  **Confirmed Value of the \"Cert Petition -> BIO\" Loop:** My initial hypothesis that the cert petition is a key signal was correct, but this observation confirms that it is only half the picture. The Brief in Opposition (BIO) is not just a rebuttal; it is a strategic document that reframes the entire case. The most effective initial research strategy for any cert-stage case is to acquire and analyze both the cert petition and the BIO in tandem. They define the legal battlefield.\n\n2.  **Refining the \"Solicitor General Signal\":** The SG's framing is a powerful starting point, but it is not dispositive. A skilled opponent, particularly one led by a former SG like Noel Francisco, can effectively dismantle or reframe that narrative. The meta-lesson is that one must identify the core of the SG's argument (here, \"structural nullification and forum shopping\") and then specifically look for how the respondent counters it (here, with \"plain text and pendent venue\"). The predictive value lies in analyzing the collision of these two frames.\n\n3.  **New Heuristic - The \"Decoupling\" Strategy:** I have refined my heuristic about analyzing interconnected statutory provisions. The SG's strength came from *linking* the standing (\"adversely affected\") and venue clauses. RJR's brilliant counter-strategy is to *decouple* them. They argue that the standing question and the venue question are separate analytical steps. This is a powerful legal reasoning tactic to watch for in future statutory cases: when one side links clauses to create a holistic narrative, see if the other side can plausibly sever that link.\n\n4.  **New Heuristic - The \"Procedural Off-Ramp\" Check:** RJR's arguments about the case being a \"poor vehicle\" (interlocutory, no circuit split, forfeiture) are a critical addition to my analytical toolkit. Before diving deep into the merits of a case, I must first assess whether there are procedural reasons the Supreme Court might simply refuse to decide it. This acts as a filter that can override a prediction based on the merits alone.\n\n5.  **Source Evaluation - Elite Counsel Signal:** The presence of Noel J. Francisco, a highly respected Supreme Court advocate and former Solicitor General, on the BIO is a strong signal of the quality and strategic sophistication of the arguments. Recognizing the lawyers involved can serve as a useful heuristic for anticipating the strength of the briefing and the specific lines of attack that will be deployed."

This essay summarizes the results of my review of those decisions. I have long considered standing doctrine to be incoherent, inconsistent, and unprincipled. The Justices use standing to further a wide variety of goals that are logically unrelated to standing.[1]\u00a0The Court\u2019s recent decisions have not changed my opinion. In\u00a0Collins v. Yellen,[2]\u00a0the conservative majority relied on a relaxed version of standing doctrine that allowed them to hold that shareholders in Fannie Mae and Freddy Mac had standing to argue that the statutory restriction on the power of the president to remove the head of the Federal Housing Finance Administration was unconstitutional. This was not a surprise. The conservative majority has long made it clear that it is determined to announce and apply new constitutional law doctrines that allow it to restructure the government by creating more \u201cofficers\u201d and making it easier for the president to remove many government officials. It has also made it clear that it will not allow doctrines like ripeness, finality, exhaustion or standing to get in the way of its implementation of that important ideological agenda.[3] The\u00a0Collins\u00a0majority then applied an interesting new version of the traceability component of the standing test as the basis for a holding that, while the shareholders had standing to make their argument, they were highly unlikely to obtain any real remedy as a result of their victory. The majority remanded the remedy question to the lower court with instructions to provide the shareholders a remedy for the violation of their constitutional rights only if the court finds a causal relationship between the violation of their rights and some agency action that caused an injury to the shareholders. The majority strongly suggested that the court could find such a causal relationship only in the highly unlikely event that it finds that the president would have removed the head of the agency for taking the action that injured the shareholders if he believed that he had an unrestricted power to remove the head of the agency. We are likely to see more opinions on remedies like the opinion in\u00a0Collins. The conservative majority is in the early stages of the process of learning that their radical campaign to restructure the government has the potential to create enormous practical problems. As those problems begin to become apparent, the conservative majority must find innovative ways of continuing their restructuring campaign without creating intolerable practical problems. The opinion in\u00a0U.S. v. Arthrex[4]\u00a0illustrates this trend. The majority first concluded that Administrative Patent Judges (APJs) would be principal officers if the majority applied its precedents to APJs because their decisions are not reviewable by any principal officer. The majority then seemed to realize that such a holding would create serious problems by adding several hundred more people to the long list of people who require Senate confirmation when the Senate is already experiencing great difficulty performing its duty to decide whether to confirm nominees for office. It avoided that unacceptable result by taking the radical step of amending the statute to confer on the head of the Patent and Trademark Appeal Board the power to review decisions of APJs\u2014a power that Congress never granted the head of the Board. That judicial rewriting of the statute allowed the majority to hold that the APJs are inferior officers because their decisions are subject to review by a principal officer. In\u00a0Uzuegbunam v. Prezenski,[5]\u00a0the Court held that the potential to obtain nominal damages is sufficient to satisfy the requirement that an injury must be redressable to qualify a plaintiff for standing when the plaintiff alleges a violation of his rights to free speech and religion. Yet, the Court has held that the potential to be awarded many thousand dollars in legal fees is not sufficient to qualify as redress for an injury to a plaintiff\u2019s ability to protect his health.[6]\u00a0It seems clear that a majority of Justices believe that it is more important to protect individuals\u2019 rights to speech and religion than to protect their rights to protect their health. That is a defensible value judgment, but it has no logical relationship with the question of who has standing to sue or what it takes to redress an injury. In\u00a0Transunion v. Ramirez,[7]\u00a0a five-Justice majority held that people whose credit reports contained false statements that strongly suggest that they are terrorists lacked standing to sue the company that negligently prepared the reports. The majority held that the victims of the false reports suffered no \u201cconcrete\u201d injury because the company that negligently prepared the reports had not yet provided them to a third party. As a result, the plaintiffs could not maintain a cause of action against the company even though Congress had clearly and explicitly authorized anyone who is the subject of a false credit report to sue the company that was responsible for the false report. Some people believe that this opinion is an unequivocal and durable holding that Congress cannot create standing to sue for violation of a statutory right unless a court finds that violation of the statute causes a \u201cconcrete\u201d injury to the victim of the violation. I am skeptical that the opinion will bear that meaning over time for two reasons. First, as the cases discussed in the dissenting opinion illustrate, the Court has issued many opinions that address the question whether Congress can create a cause of action for violation of a statute. Those opinions are not a model of consistency.\u00a0 At least two of the Court\u2019s prior opinions seem to stand for the proposition that Congress has the power to create standing by creating a statutory right and conferring standing to vindicate that right on a private party who is injured in some way as a result of a violation of the right created by the statute[8]\u00a0\u2014 the opposite of the holding in\u00a0Transunion. I suspect that the\u00a0Transunion\u00a0opinion will become just one more of the many inconsistent opinions that address the issue. Second, Justice Thomas wrote a dissenting opinion in\u00a0Transunion\u00a0that attacks the reasoning of the majority in ways that will make it difficult to defend the reasoning and holding of the case over time. He explained why the defendant\u2019s action violated three private rights held by the plaintiffs. He then accused the majority of making up the requirement that an injury must be \u201cconcrete\u201d to qualify a plaintiff for standing. The case or controversy clause in Article III contains no reference to the need to vindicate a right that a court considers to be \u201cconcrete.\u201d He concluded by accusing the majority of judicial aggrandizement based on its view that a court can decide that an injury to a private right is not important enough to support a lawsuit when Congress has decided that the injury is sufficiently important to give rise to a case or controversy that a court can resolve. In\u00a0California v. Texas,[9]\u00a0the Court held that standing precluded the Court from deciding whether the Affordable Care Act (ACA) was unconstitutional after Congress amended it by eliminating its potential to raise revenue, thereby arguably undermining the sole basis on which the Court had earlier held that Congress had the power to enact the ACA. The majority held that none of the states and none of the individuals who sought to challenge the validity of the amended statute were injured\u00a0by the amendment\u00a0that eliminated the potential for the statute to raise revenues. The majority declined to consider the argument that\u00a0the statute as amended\u00a0injured the states or individuals. As the two dissenting Justices pointed out, that was the appropriate question to ask for purposes of deciding whether the states or individuals had standing to argue that the amended statute was unconstitutional, and it was easy to conclude that the amended statute injured both the individuals and the states. The majority opinion in\u00a0California v. Texas\u00a0is peculiar in another way as well. In\u00a0Massachusetts v. EPA,[10]\u00a0the Court held that standing has \u201cspecial solicitude\u201d for states. It went on to hold that Massachusetts had standing when an individual, association or corporation would not have had standing. The dissenting Justices relied in part on the special status of states that the Court had previously recognized, but the majority ignored that part of standing law entirely without even bothering to explain why they did not extend \u201cspecial solicitude\u201d to the states that sought to challenge the constitutionality of the amended ACA. The majority opinion leaves us with no way of knowing whether the special status of states in standing disputes is gone permanently or has only lapsed briefly for purposes of this case. If the majority\u2019s reasoning and holding on standing in\u00a0California v. Texas\u00a0was based on a result-oriented distortion of standing law, as I believe, that raises an obvious question: why did the majority rely on a distorted version of standing law to dispose of the case. I have an easy answer. The Court wanted to avoid the nasty debate among the Justices about the constitutionality of the ACA that would have been inevitable if it had held that the anyone had standing to challenge the constitutionality of the amended ACA. That debate would divide the Justices along political lines, thereby giving more ammunition to the critics of the Court who see the Court as a purely political institution. Moreover, such a debate would not change the outcome of the case because the Justices who argued that the amended statute was unconstitutional would then have relied on the Court\u2019s standard method of resolving severability disputes as the basis for a holding that the amendment could be severed from the rest of the statute, thereby leaving the ACA in effect. In\u00a0Department of Commerce v. New York,[11]\u00a0the Court held that a court can decide whether an alleged future injury qualifies for standing by applying either of two tests\u2014the nearly-impossible-to-satisfy \u201ccertainly impending\u201d test that the Court announced in\u00a0Clapper v. Amnesty\u00a0International[12]\u00a0or the easy-to-satisfy \u201csubstantial risk\u201d of occurrence test that preceded\u00a0Clapper. Why would the Court give lower courts a choice between applying an easy-to-satisfy test or a nearly-impossible-to satisfy test to resolve an important issue that arises in many standing cases? That question is easy to answer based on the facts of\u00a0Clapper. Journalists sought to challenge the constitutionality of a government surveillance system. They argued that they had standing because the surveillance system interfered with their rights by discouraging sources of information from talking to them. The government took the position that the surveillance system did not exist, and that any future injury that might be caused by such a system was too speculative to support standing. In that context, the Court applied the new \u201ccertainly impending\u201d test as the basis for its holding that it could not decide whether the surveillance system was constitutional. The reason the Court announced and applied an impossible-to-satisfy test in\u00a0Clapper\u00a0is obvious. The Court did not want to decide whether the surveillance system was illegal. The Justices must have been embarrassed a few months after the\u00a0Clapper\u00a0decision when the government publicly acknowledged that it had been implementing the surveillance system for years at the time that the Court questioned its existence and characterized its harmful effects as unduly speculative. By the time the Court decided\u00a0Department of Commerce v. New York, the Court had reconsidered the Clapper\u00a0test and decided to return to the pre-Clapper\u00a0test. That takes me to the Court\u2019s most recent foray into standing law. On September 1, 2021, s five-Justice majority refused to issue a stay that would have temporarily precluded Texas from implementing a new statute that had the immediate effect of banning all abortions after the first six weeks of a pregnancy.[13]\u00a0The statute accomplished that result by authorizing anyone to file a civil action against anyone who \u201caids or abets\u201d the performance of such an abortion in a state court and instructing the state judge to award $10,000 in damages in each such case. The actual reason for the decision is obvious. The five Justices who refused to stay implementation of the statute oppose abortion. They were content to allow a state to implement a statute that is clearly inconsistent with\u00a0Roe v. Wade[14]\u00a0without incurring the wrath of the majority of the public that favors a right to abortion by overturning\u00a0Roe. The majority accomplished that result by saying that it was not addressing the merits of the case. In a strange one paragraph opinion, the majority referred to \u201cprocedural problems\u201d that precluded it from staying implementation of the statute. The majority did not refer to standing, but it cited\u00a0Clapper\u00a0and quoted the \u201ccertainly impending\u201d test in a parenthetical following that citation.\u00a0 That citation implies that the majority could not stay implementation of the Texas statute because no petitioner could satisfy the test to determine whether they have standing based on a future injury. There are two problems with the reasoning of the majority in the Texas abortion case. First, the\u00a0Clapper\u00a0test is irrelevant after the Court\u2019s decision in\u00a0Department of Commerce v. New York. A petitioner who relies on an alleged future injury as the basis for standing needs only to satisfy the easy-to-satisfy pre-Clapper\u00a0test by showing that there is a \u201csubstantial risk\u201d that the petitioner will suffer a future injury. Second, it is easy to show that anyone who is over six weeks pregnant who wants an abortion in Texas was injured immediately by implementation of the Texas statute. Clinics that had scheduled such abortions immediately announced that they would no longer provide such abortions and turned away patients who were scheduled for the procedure. It is obvious that the majority\u2019s reliance on standing to bar anyone from challenging the constitutionality of the Texas abortion statute was a fabrication. The majority hoped to use a distorted version of standing law to explain why it was acting in a way that makes it impossible for a woman who is more than six weeks pregnant to obtain an abortion without having the courage to overrule\u00a0Roe v. Wade. It will be interesting to see how the Court reacts to a request to stay a state statute that authorizes anyone to obtain $10,000 in civil damages from anyone who owns a gun. The Texas abortion statute raises an obvious standing problem of a completely different type. Any person who files a civil action for damages against someone who aids or abets an abortion because the plaintiff disapproves of abortion would have no chance of satisfying the requirement that they have suffered a \u201cparticularized\u201d injury. Thus, any such suit would be dismissed based on lack of standing if it was brought in a federal court. Article III does not apply in state courts, however, and it is highly unlikely that the elected members of the Texas Supreme Court will refuse to give effect to the Texas statute based on standing. If you want to watch a lively debate about the meaning and significance of the Supreme Court\u2019s recent standing decisions, you can do so by \u201cattending\u201d the session on standing at the Fall symposium of the ABA Section on Administrative Law and Regulatory Practice that will be held virtually on November 18 and 19.

Argued March 26, 2024\u2014Decided June 13, 2024* \nIn 2000, the Food and Drug Administration approved a new drug\napplication for mifepristone tablet s marketed under the brand name\nMifeprex for use in terminating pregnancies up to seven weeks.  To \nhelp ensure that Mifeprex would be used safely and effectively, FDA \nplaced additional restrictions on the drug\u2019s use and distribution, for \nexample requiring doctors to prescribe  or to supervise prescription of\nMifeprex, and requiring pa tients to have three in-person visits with \nthe doctor to receive the drug.  In 2016, FDA relaxed some of these \nrestrictions: deeming Mifeprex safe to terminate pregnancies up to 10 \nweeks; allowing healthcare providers,  such as nurse practitioners, to\nprescribe Mifeprex; and approving a do sing regimen that required just\none in-person visit to receive the drug.  In 2019, FDA approved an application for generic mifepristone.  In 2021, FDA announced that it would no longer enforce the initial in-person visit requirement.  Four \npro-life medical associations and se veral individual doctors moved for \na preliminary injunction that woul d require FDA either to rescind\napproval of mifepristone or to rescind FDA\u2019s 2016 and 2021 regulatoryactions. Danco Laboratories, which sponsors Mifeprex, intervened to \ndefend FDA\u2019s actions. \nThe District Court agreed with the plaintiffs and in effect enjoined \nFDA\u2019s approval of mifepristone, ther eby ordering mifepristone off the \nmarket. FDA and Danco appealed and moved to stay the DistrictCourt\u2019s order pending appeal.  As relevant here, this Court ultimately \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n*Together with No. 23\u2013236, Danco Laboratories, L.L.C.  v.

ALLIANCE FOR HIPPOCRATIC MEDICINE \nSyllabus \nstayed the District Court\u2019s order pending the disposition of \nproceedings in the Fifth Circuit and this Court.  On the merits, the \nFifth Circuit held that plaintiffs had standing.  It concluded that plaintiffs were unlikely to succeed on their challenge to FDA\u2019s 2000 and 2019 drug approvals, but were likely to succeed in showing that\nFDA\u2019s 2016 and 2021 actions were unlawful.  This Court granted\ncertiorari with respect to the 2016 and 2021 FDA actions. \nHeld : Plaintiffs lack Article III stan ding to challenge FDA\u2019s actions \nregarding the regulation of mifepristone.  Pp. 5\u201325.\n(a) Article III standing is a \u201cbedro ck constitutional requirement that \nthis Court has applied to all manner of important disputes.\u201d  United \nStates v. Texas , 599 U. S. 670, 675.  Standing is \u201cbuilt on a single basic\nidea\u2014the idea of separation of powers.\u201d Ibid. Article III confines the \njurisdiction of federal courts to \u201cCases\u201d and \u201cControversies.\u201d  Federal \ncourts do not operate as an open forum for citizens \u201cto press general \ncomplaints about the way in wh ich government goes about its \nbusiness.\u201d  Allen v. Wright , 468 U. S. 737, 760.  To obtain a judicial\ndetermination of what the governing law is, a plaintiff must have a \u201cpersonal stake\u201d in the dispute.  TransUnion LLC  v. Ramirez , 594 \nU. S. 413, 423. \nTo establish standing, a plaintiff must demonstrate (i) that she has\nsuffered or likely will suffer an injury in fact, (ii) that the injury likely \nwas caused or will be caused by the defendant, and (iii) that the injury \nlikely would be redressed by the requested judicial relief. See \nSummers  v. Earth Island Institute , 555 U. S. 488, 493. The two key \nquestions in most standing disputes are injury in fact and causation. By requiring the plaintiff to show an injury in fact, Article III standing screens out plaintiffs who might have only a general legal, moral, \nideological, or policy objection to a particular government action. \nCausation requires the plaintiff to establish that the plaintiff \u2019s injury \nlikely was caused or likely will be ca used by the defendant\u2019s conduct. \nCausation is \u201cordinarily substantially more difficult to establish\u201d when \n(as here) a plaintiff challenges the government\u2019s \u201cunlawful regulation \n(or lack of regulation) of someone else.\u201d Lujan  v. Defenders of Wildlife , \n504 U. S. 555, 560\u2013561.  That is be cause unregulated parties often may\nhave more difficulty linking their a sserted injuries to the government\u2019s \nregulation (or lack of regulation) of someone else.  Pp. 5\u201312.\n(b) Plaintiffs are pro-life, oppose elective abortion, and have sincere\nlegal, moral, ideological, and policy objections to mifepristone being\nprescribed and used by others .  Because plaintiffs do not prescribe or \nuse mifepristone, plaintiffs are unregulated parties who seek to \nchallenge FDA\u2019s regulation of others . Plaintiffs advance several \ncomplicated causation theories to  connect FDA\u2019s actions to the \nplaintiffs\u2019 alleged injuries in fact. None of these theories suffices to \n  \n \n \n   \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n    \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n   3 Cite as: 602 U. S. ____ (2024) \nSyllabus \nestablish Article III standing.  Pp. 13\u201324.\n(1) Plaintiffs first contend th at FDA\u2019s relaxed regulation of \nmifepristone may cause downstream conscience injuries to the \nindividual doctors.  Even assuming that FDA\u2019s 2016 and 2021 changes to mifepristone\u2019s conditions of use cause more pregnant women to \nrequire emergency abortions and that some women would likely seek\ntreatment from these plaintiff doctors, the plaintiff doctors have not shown that they could be forced to participate in an abortion or provide \nabortion-related medical treatment over their conscience objections. Federal conscience laws definiti vely protect doctors from being \nrequired to perform abortions or to provide other treatment that \nviolates their consciences. Federal law protects doctors from repercussions when they have \u201crefused \u201d to participate in an abortion. \n\u00a7300a\u20137(c)(1).  The plaintiffs have not identified any instances where \na doctor was required, notwithstanding conscience objections, to\nperform an abortion or to provide other abortion-related treatment that violated the doctor\u2019s conscience since mifepristone\u2019s 2000 approval.  Further, the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act \n(or EMTALA) neither overrides federal conscience laws nor requires \nindividual emergency room doctor s to participate in emergency \nabortions.  Thus, there is a break in any chain of causation between\nFDA\u2019s relaxed regulation of mifepristone and any asserted conscience \ninjuries to the doctors.  Pp. 14\u201317. \n(2) Plaintiffs next assert they have standing because FDA\u2019s\nrelaxed regulation of mifepristone  may cause downstream economic\ninjuries to the doctors.  The doctors cite various monetary and related injuries that they will allegedly suffe r as a result of FDA\u2019s actions\u2014in\nparticular, diverting resources and ti me from other patients to treat \npatients with mifepristone complic ations; increasing risk of liability\nsuits from treating those patien ts; and potentially increasing\ninsurance costs.  But the causal link between FDA\u2019s regulatory actionsin 2016 and 2021 and those alleged injuries is too speculative, lacks support in the record, and is othe rwise too attenuated to establish \nstanding.  Moreover, the law has ne ver permitted doctors to challenge\nthe government\u2019s loosening of general public safety requirementssimply because more individuals mi ght then show up at emergency \nrooms or in doctors\u2019 offices with follow-on injuries. Citizens and doctors who object to what the law a llows others to do may always take\ntheir concerns to the Executive an d Legislative Branches and seek \ngreater regulatory or legislative restrictions.  Pp. 18\u201321.\n(3) Plaintiff medical associations assert their own organizational \nstanding.  Under the Court\u2019s precedents, organizations may have \nstanding \u201cto sue on their own behalf for injuries they have sustained,\u201d \nHavens Realty Corp.  v. Coleman , 455 U. S. 363, 379, n. 19, but \n \n   \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 4 FDA v. ALLIANCE FOR HIPPOCRATIC MEDICINE \nSyllabus \norganizations must satisfy the usual standards for injury in fact, \ncausation, and redressability that apply to individuals, id., at 378\u2013379. \nAccording to the medical associations, FDA has \u201cimpaired\u201d their\u201cability to provide services and achiev e their organizational missions.\u201d\nBrief for Respondents 43.  That argument does not work to \ndemonstrate standing.  Like an individual, an organization may not \nestablish standing simply based on  the \u201cintensity of the litigant\u2019s \ninterest\u201d or because of strong opposition to the government\u2019s conduct, \nValley Forge Christian College  v. Americans United for Separation of \nChurch and State, Inc. , 454 U. S. 464, 486.  The plaintiff associations \ntherefore cannot establish standing simply because they object to FDA\u2019s actions.  The medical associations claim to have standing based \non their incurring costs to oppose FDA\u2019s actions.  They say that FDA has \u201ccaused\u201d the associations to conduct their own studies on \nmifepristone so that the associatio ns can better inform their members\nand the public about mifepristone\u2019s risks.  Brief for Respondents 43. \nThey contend that FDA has \u201cforce d\u201d the associations to \u201cexpend\nconsiderable time, energy, and resources\u201d drafting citizen petitions toFDA, as well as engaging in public advocacy and public education, all\nto the detriment of other spending priorities.  Id., at 44. But an \norganization that has not suffered a concrete injury caused by a defendant\u2019s action cannot spend its way into standing simply by expending money to gather inform ation and advocate against the \ndefendant\u2019s action.  Contrary to  what the medical associations \ncontend, the Court\u2019s decision in Havens Realty Corp.  v. Coleman does \nnot stand for the expansive theory that standing exists when an \norganization diverts its resources in response to a defendant\u2019s actions. Havens  was an unusual case, and this Court has been careful not to \nextend the Havens  holding beyond its context.  So too here. \nFinally, it was suggested that plai ntiffs must have standing because \notherwise it may be that no one would have standing to challenge \nFDA\u2019s 2016 and 2021 actions.  That suggestion fails because the Court \nhas long rejected that kind of argument as a basis for standing.  The \u201cassumption\u201d that if these plaintif fs lack \u201cstanding to sue, no one \nwould have standing, is not a reason to find standing.\u201d  Schlesinger  v. \nReservists Comm. to Stop the War , 418 U. S. 208, 227.  Rather, some \nissues may be left to the political and democratic processes.

Those changes made it easier for doctors to \nprescribe and pregnant women to obtain mifepristone.\nSeveral pro-life doctors and associations sued FDA, arguing\nthat FDA\u2019s actions violated the Administrative Procedure Act. But the plaintiffs do not prescribe or use mifepristone.\nAnd FDA is not requiring them to do or refrain from doing\nanything. Rather, the plaintiffs want FDA to make mifepristone more difficult for other doctors to prescribe \nand for pregnant women to obtain.  Under Article III of the Constitution, a plaintiff \u2019s desire to make a drug less\navailable for others does not establish standing to sue. Nor \ndo the plaintiffs\u2019 other standing theories suffice.  Therefore, \nthe plaintiffs lack standing to challenge FDA\u2019s actions. \n \n   \n   \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 2 FDA v. ALLIANCE FOR HIPPOCRATIC MEDICINE \nOpinion of the Court \nI \nA \nUnder federal law, the U. S. Food and Drug\nAdministration, an agency within the Executive Branch, \nensures that drugs on the market are safe and effective. \nFor FDA to approve a new drug, the drug sponsor (usually \nthe drug\u2019s manufacturer or potential marketer) must \nsubmit an application demonstrating that the drug is safeand effective when used as directed.  21 U. S. C. \u00a7355(d). \nThe sponsor\u2019s application must  generally include proposed \nlabeling that specifies the drug\u2019s dosage, how to take the\ndrug, and the specific conditio ns that the drug may treat.\n21 CFR \u00a7\u00a7201.5, 314.50 (2022). \nIf FDA determines that additional safety requirements\nare necessary, FDA may impose extra requirements on prescription and use of the drug.  21 U. S. C. \u00a7355\u20131(f )(3).  \nFor example, FDA may require that prescribers undergo \nspecialized training; mandate that the drug be dispensed \nonly in certain settings like hospitals; or direct that doctors\nmonitor patients taking the drug.  Ibid. \nIn 2000, FDA approved a new drug application for\nmifepristone tablets marketed under the brand name \nMifeprex. FDA approved Mifeprex for use to terminate pregnancies, but only up to seven weeks of pregnancy.  To \nhelp ensure that Mifeprex would be used safely and\neffectively, FDA placed further restrictions on the drug\u2019suse and distribution. For example, only doctors could \nprescribe or supervise prescri ption of Mifeprex.  Doctors \nand patients also had to follo w a strict regimen requiring\nthe patient to appear for three in-person visits with the\ndoctor. And FDA directed pres cribing doctors to report\nincidents of hospitalizations, blood transfusions, or other \nserious adverse events to the drug sponsor (who, in turn, \nwas required to report the events to FDA).\nIn 2015, Mifeprex\u2019s distributor Danco Laboratories \nsubmitted a supplemental new drug application seeking to \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 3 Cite as: 602 U. S. ____ (2024) \nOpinion of the Court \namend Mifeprex\u2019s labeling and to relax some of the restrictions that FDA had imposed.  In 2016, FDA approved \nthe proposed changes. FDA deemed Mifeprex safe to\nterminate pregnancies up to 10 weeks rather than 7 weeks. \nFDA allowed healthcare providers such as nurse practitioners to prescribe Mi feprex.  And FDA approved a\ndosing regimen that reduce d the number of required in-\nperson visits from three to one\u2014a single visit to receive Mifeprex. In addition, FDA changed prescribers\u2019 adverse\nevent reporting obligations to require prescribers to report\nonly fatalities\u2014a reporting requirement that was still more stringent than the requirements for most other drugs.\nIn 2019, FDA approved an application for generic \nmifepristone. FDA established the same conditions of use \nfor generic mifepristo ne as for Mifeprex. \nIn 2021, FDA again relaxed the requirements for \nMifeprex and generic mifepristo ne.  Relying on experience \ngained during the COVID\u201319 pandemic about pregnant \nwomen using mifepristone without an in-person visit to a \nhealthcare provider, FDA announced that it would nolonger enforce the initial in-person visit requirement. \nB \nBecause mifepristone is used to terminate pregnancies,\nFDA\u2019s approval and regulation of mifepristone have\ngenerated substantial controversy from the start. In 2002, \nthree pro-life associations subm itted a joint citizen petition\nasking FDA to rescind its approval of Mifeprex. FDA \ndenied their petition.\nIn 2019, two pro-life medical associations filed another\npetition, this time asking  FDA to withdraw its 2016 \nmodifications to mifepristone\u2019s conditions of use.  FDA \ndenied that petition as well. \nThis case began in 2022. Four pro-life medical\nassociations, as well as seve ral individual doctors, sued \nFDA in the U. S. District Court for the Northern District of \n \n   \n  \n  \n \n  \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n 4 FDA v. ALLIANCE FOR HIPPOCRATIC MEDICINE \nOpinion of the Court \nTexas. Plaintiffs brought claims under the Administrative \nProcedure Act.  They challe nged the lawfulness of FDA\u2019s \n2000 approval of Mifeprex; FD A\u2019s 2019 approval of generic \nmifepristone; and FDA\u2019s 2016 and 2021 actions modifying mifepristone\u2019s conditions of use.  Danco Laboratories, which \nsponsors Mifeprex, intervened to defend FDA\u2019s actions.\nThe plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction that\nwould require FDA to rescind approval of mifepristone or, at the very least, to rescind FDA\u2019s 2016 and 2021 actions. \nThe District Court agreed with the plaintiffs and in effect\nenjoined FDA\u2019s approval of mifepristone, thereby ordering mifepristone off the market.  668 F. Supp. 3d 507 (ND Tex. \n2023). The court first held that the plaintiffs possessed\nArticle III standing.  It then determined that the plaintiffs\nwere likely to succeed on the merits of each of their claims.\nFinally, the court concluded that the plaintiffs would suffer irreparable harm from FDA\u2019s continued approval of\nmifepristone and that an injunction would serve the public\ninterest. \nFDA and Danco promptly appealed and moved to stay the\nDistrict Court\u2019s order pending appeal.  The U. S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit granted the stay motion in \npart and temporarily reinstated FDA\u2019s approval of \nMifeprex. 2023 WL 2913725, *21 (Apr. 12, 2023).  But the \nCourt of Appeals declined to st ay the rest of the District\nCourt\u2019s order.  The Court of Appeals\u2019 partial stay would\nhave left Mifeprex (though not generic mifepristone) on the \nmarket, but only under the more stringent requirements \nimposed when FDA first approved Mifeprex in 2000\u2014\navailable only up to seven weeks of pregnancy, only when\nprescribed by doctors, and only with three in-person visits,among other requirements.\nFDA and Danco then sought a full stay in this Court.\nThis Court stayed the District Court\u2019s order in its entirety\npending the disposition of FDA\u2019s and Danco\u2019s appeals in the \nCourt of Appeals and ultimate re solution by this Court.  598 \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n 5 Cite as: 602 U.

As a result of this Court\u2019s stay, Mifeprex\nand generic mifepristone have remained available as \nallowed by FDA\u2019s relaxed 2016 and 2021 requirements.\nA few months later, the Court of Appeals issued its\ndecision on the merits of the District Court\u2019s order, affirming in part and vacating in part. 78 F. 4th 210, 222\u2013 \n223 (CA5 2023).  The Court of Appeals first concluded that \nthe individual doctors and the pro-life medical associations had standing. The Court of Appeals next concluded that \nplaintiffs were not likely to succeed on their challenge to\nFDA\u2019s 2000 approval of Mifeprex and 2019 approval of \ngeneric mifepristone. So the Court of Appeals vacated the \nDistrict Court\u2019s order as to those agency actions.  But the Court of Appeals agreed with the District Court that \nplaintiffs were likely to succeed in showing that FDA\u2019s 2016\nand 2021 actions were unlawful. \nThe Court of Appeals\u2019 merits  decision did not alter this \nCourt\u2019s stay of the District Court\u2019s order pending thisCourt\u2019s review.  This Court then granted certiorari with\nrespect to the 2016 and 2021 FDA actions held unlawful by \nthe Court of Appeals. 601 U.

As this Court \nexplained to President George Washington in 1793 in\nresponse to his request for a legal opinion, federal courts do\nnot issue advisory opinions about the law\u2014even when requested by the President. 13 Papers of George\nWashington: Presidential Series 392 (C. Patrick ed. 2007).\nNor do federal courts operate as  an open forum for citizens \n\u201cto press general complaints about the way in which \ngovernment goes about its business.\u201d  Allen v. Wright , 468 \nU. S. 737, 760 (1984) (quotation marks omitted); see \nCalifornia v. Texas , 593 U. S. 659, 673 (2021); Valley Forge \nChristian College  v.

Scalia, The Doctrine of Standing as an Essential \nElement of the Separation of Powers, 17 Suffolk U. L. Rev. 881, 882 (1983).  For a plaintiff to get in the federal\ncourthouse door and obtain a judicial determination of what \nthe governing law is, the plaintiff cannot be a mere\nbystander, but instead must hav e a \u201cpersonal stake\u201d in the \ndispute. TransUnion , 594 U. S., at 423.  The requirement\nthat the plaintiff possess a pers onal stake helps ensure that \ncourts decide litigants\u2019 legal rights in specific cases, as\nArticle III requires, and that courts do not opine on legal \nissues in response to citizens who might \u201croam the countryin search of governmental wrongdoing.\u201d  Valley Forge , 454 \nU. S., at 487; see, e.g., Schlesinger  v. Reservists Comm. to \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 7 Cite as: 602 U. S. ____ (2024) \nOpinion of the Court \nStop the War , 418 U.

Standing also \u201ctends to assure that\nthe legal questions presented to the court will be resolved, \nnot in the rarified atmosphere of a debating society, but in a concrete factual context conducive to a realistic \nappreciation of the consequences of judicial action.\u201d  Valley \nForge , 454 U. S., at 472.  Moreover, the standing doctrine\nserves to protect the \u201cautonomy\u201d of those who are most \ndirectly affected so that they can decide whether and how to challenge the defendant\u2019s action.  Id., at 473. \nBy limiting who can sue, the standing requirement\nimplements \u201cthe Framers\u2019 concept of the proper\u2014and\nproperly limited\u2014role of the courts in a democratic society.\u201d\nJ. Roberts, Article III Limits on Statutory Standing, 42\nDuke L. J. 1219, 1220 (1993) (quotation marks omitted).  In \nparticular, the standing requirement means that thefederal courts decide some contested legal questions later \nrather than sooner, thereby allowing issues to percolate and \npotentially be resolved by the political branches in the democratic process.  See Raines v. Byrd , 521 U. S. 811, 829\u2013 \n830 (1997); cf. Clapper v. Amnesty Int\u2019l USA , 568 U. S. 398, \n420\u2013422 (2013). And the standing requirement means that \nthe federal courts may never n eed to decide some contested \nlegal questions: \u201cOur system of government leaves many crucial decisions to the political processes,\u201d where \ndemocratic debate can occur and a wide variety of interests and views can be weighed. Schlesinger , 418 U. S., at 227; \nsee Campbell v. Clinton , 203 F. 3d 19, 23 (CADC 2000). \nA \nThe fundamentals of standing are well-known and firmly \nrooted in American constitutional law. To establish \nstanding, as this Court has often stated, a plaintiff must\ndemonstrate (i) that she has suffered or likely will suffer an injury in fact, (ii) that the injury likely was caused or will \n \n   \n  \n \n  \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n 8 FDA v. ALLIANCE FOR HIPPOCRATIC MEDICINE \nOpinion of the Court \nbe caused by the defendant, and (iii) that the injury likely \nwould be redressed by the requested judicial relief. See \nSummers  v. Earth Island Institute , 555 U. S. 488, 493 \n(2009); Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife , 504 U. S. 555, 560\u2013 \n561 (1992). Those specific standing requirements constitute \u201can essential and unchanging part of the case-or-\ncontroversy requirement of Article III.\u201d  Id., at 560. \nThe second and third standing requirements\u2014causation \nand redressability\u2014are often \u201cflip sides of the same coin.\u201d Sprint Communications Co.  v. APCC Services, Inc. , 554 \nU. S. 269, 288 (2008).  If a defendant\u2019s action causes an \ninjury, enjoining the action or awarding damages for the action will typically redress that injury.  So the two key \nquestions in most standing disputes are injury in fact and \ncausation.\n1 \nFirst  is injury in fact. An injury in fact must be\n\u201cconcrete,\u201d meaning that it must be real and not abstract.See TransUnion , 594 U. S., at 424.  The injury also must be\nparticularized; the injury must affect \u201cthe plaintiff in a personal and individual way\u201d  and not be a generalized\ngrievance. Lujan, 504 U. S., at 560, n. 1.  An injury in fact \ncan be a physical injury, a monetary injury, an injury to one\u2019s property, or an injury to one\u2019s constitutional rights, to \ntake just a few common examples. Moreover, the injury\nmust be actual or imminent, not speculative\u2014meaning that \nthe injury must have already occurred or be likely to occur soon. Clapper, 568 U. S., at 409.  And when a plaintiff seeks\nprospective relief such as an in junction, the plaintiff must\nestablish a sufficient likelihood of future injury.  Id., at 401. \nBy requiring the plaintiff to show an injury in fact, Article \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n1Redressability can still pose an inde pendent bar in some cases. For \nexample, a plaintiff who suffers injuri es caused by the government still \nmay not be able to sue because the case may not be of the kind \n\u201ctraditionally redressabl e in federal court.\u201d  United States v. Texas , 599 \nU. S. 670, 676 (2023); cf. California v. Texas , 593 U. S. 659, 671\u2013672 \n(2021). \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n   \n \n  \n \n \n 9 Cite as: 602 U. S. ____ (2024) \nOpinion of the Court \nIII standing screens out plaintiffs who might have only a\ngeneral legal, moral, ideological, or policy objection to a \nparticular government action.  For example, a citizen doesnot have standing to challeng e a government regulation \nsimply because the plaintiff believes that the governmentis acting illegally.  See Valley Forge , 454 U. S., at 473, 487. \nA citizen may not sue based only on an \u201casserted right tohave the Government act in accordance with law.\u201d Allen, \n468 U. S., at 754; Schlesinger , 418 U. S., at 225\u2013227.  Nor \nmay citizens sue merely because their legal objection isaccompanied by a strong moral, ideological, or policy\nobjection to a government action. See Valley Forge, 454 \nU. S., at 473. \nThe injury in fact requirement prevents the federal \ncourts from becoming a \u201cvehic le for the vindication of the\nvalue interests of concerned bystanders.\u201d  Allen, 468 U. S., \nat 756 (quotation marks omitted).  An Article III court is \nnot a legislative assembly, a town square, or a faculty \nlounge. Article III does not contemplate a system where\n330 million citizens can come to federal court whenever \nthey believe that the government is acting contrary to the\nConstitution or other federal law.  See id., at 754. \nVindicating \u201cthe public  interest (including the public\ninterest in Government observ ance of the Constitution and \nlaws) is the function of Congress and the Chief Executive.\u201d Lujan, 504 U. S., at 576. \nIn sum, to sue in federal court, a plaintiff must show that\nhe or she has suffered or likely will suffer an injury in fact. \nSecond is causation. The plaintiff must also establish\nthat the plaintiff \u2019s injury likely was caused or likely will be \ncaused by the defendant\u2019s conduct. \nGovernment regulations that require or forbid some\naction by the plaintiff almost invariably satisfy both the\ninjury in fact and causation requirements. So in those cases, standing is usually easy to establish.  See Lujan, 504 \nU. S., at 561\u2013562; see, e .g., Susan B. Anthony List  v. \n \n   \n  \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n   \n 10 FDA v. ALLIANCE FOR HIPPOCRATIC MEDICINE \nOpinion of the Court \nDriehaus , 573 U. S. 149, 162\u2013163 (2014). \nBy contrast, when (as here) a plaintiff challenges the \ngovernment\u2019s \u201cunlawful regulation (or lack of regulation) of \nsomeone else ,\u201d \u201cstanding is not precluded, but it is ordinarily \nsubstantially more difficult to establish.\u201d Lujan, 504 U. S., \nat 562 (quotation marks omitted); see Summers , 555 U. S., \nat 493. That is often because unregulated parties may have \nmore difficulty establishing causation\u2014that is, linking\ntheir asserted injuries to the government\u2019s regulation (or \nlack of regulation) of someone else.  See Clapper, 568 U. S., \nat 413\u2013414; Lujan, 504 U. S., at 562; Duke Power Co.  v. \nCarolina Environmental Study Group, Inc. , 438 U. S. 59, 74 \n(1978); Simon  v. Eastern Ky. Welfare Rights Organization , \n426 U. S. 26, 41\u201346 (1976); Warth  v. Seldin, 422 U. S. 490, \n504\u2013508 (1975).\nWhen the plaintiff is an unregulated party, causation \n\u201cordinarily hinge[s] on the response of the regulated (or regulable) third party to the government action or \ninaction\u2014and perhaps on the response of others as well.\u201d Lujan, 504 U. S., at 562. Yet the Court has said that \nplaintiffs attempting to show causation generally cannot \n\u201crely on speculation about the unfettered choices made by\nindependent actors not before the courts.\u201d Clapper, 568 \nU. S., at 415, n. 5 (quotation marks omitted); see also \nBennett v. Spear , 520 U. S. 154, 168\u2013169 (1997).  Therefore, \nto thread the causation needle in those circumstances, the \nplaintiff must show that the \u201c \u2018third parties will likely react\nin predictable ways\u2019 \u201d that in turn will likely injure the\nplaintiffs. California , 593 U. S., at 675 (quoting \nDepartment of Commerce  v. New York , 588 U. S. 752, 768 \n(2019)).\nAs this Court has explained, the \u201cline of causation \nbetween the illegal conduct and injury\u201d\u2014the \u201clinks in the chain of causation,\u201d  Allen , 468 U. S., at 752, 759\u2014must not \nbe too speculative or too attenuated, Clapper , 568 U. S., at \n410\u2013411.

See Allen , 468 U. S., at \n757\u2013759; Simon, 426 U. S., at 41\u201346. The causation \nrequirement also rules out attenuated links\u2014that is, where the government action is so far removed from its distant\n(even if predictable) ripple e ffects that the plaintiffs cannot \nestablish Article III standing.  See Allen, 468 U. S., at 757\u2013 \n759; cf. Department of Commerce , 588 U. S., at 768. \nThe causation requirement is central to Article III \nstanding. Like the injury in fact requirement, the causationrequirement screens out plainti ffs who were not injured by\nthe defendant\u2019s action. Without the causation requirement, courts would be \u201cvirtually continuing monitors of the \nwisdom and soundness\u201d of government action.  Allen, 468 \nU. S., at 760 (quotation marks omitted). \nDetermining causation in cases involving suits by\nunregulated parties against the government is admittedly \nnot a \u201cmechanical exercise.\u201d Id., at 751. That is because \nthe causation inquiry can be heavily fact-dependent and a \u201cquestion of degree,\u201d as private petitioner\u2019s counsel aptly\ndescribed it here. Tr. of Oral Arg. 50. Unfortunately,applying the law of standing cannot be made easy, and that \nis particularly true for causation. Just as causation in tort \nlaw can pose line-drawing difficulties, so too can causation \nin standing law when determining whether an unregulated \nparty has standing.\nThat said, the \u201cabsence of precise definitions\u201d has not left \ncourts entirely \u201cat sea in applying the law of standing.\u201d Allen, 468 U. S., at 751.  Like \u201cmost legal notions, the\nstanding concepts have gained considerable definition from\ndeveloping case law.\u201d Ibid.   As the Court has explained, in \n\u201cmany cases the standing question can be answered chiefly \nby comparing the allegations of the particular complaint to\nthose made in prior standing cases.\u201d  Id., at 751\u2013752. \nStated otherwise, assessing standing \u201cin a particular case \n \n   \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n 12 FDA v. ALLIANCE FOR HIPPOCRATIC MEDICINE \nOpinion of the Court \nmay be facilitated by clarifying principles or even clear\nrules developed in prior cases.\u201d Id., at 752. \nConsistent with that understanding of how standing \nprinciples can develop and solidify, the Court has identified a variety of familiar circumstances where government \nregulation of a third-party individual or business may be \nlikely to cause injury in fact to an unregulated plaintiff. For \nexample, when the government regulates (or under-regulates) a business, the regulation (or lack thereof ) may\ncause downstream or upstream economic injuries to others\nin the chain, such as certain manufacturers, retailers, \nsuppliers, competitors, or customers. E.g., National Credit \nUnion Admin.  v. First Nat. Bank & Trust Co. , 522 U. S. 479, \n488, n. 4 (1998); General Motors Corp. v. Tracy , 519 U. S. \n278, 286\u2013287 (1997); Barlow  v. Collins , 397 U. S. 159, 162\u2013 \n164 (1970); Association of Data Processing Service \nOrganizations, Inc.  v. Camp , 397 U. S. 150, 152 (1970).\nWhen the government regulates parks, national forests, or \nbodies of water, for example, the regulation may cause harm to individual users.  E.g., Summers, 555 U. S., at 494. \nWhen the government regulates one property, it mayreduce the value of adjacent property.  The list goes on.  See, \ne.g., Department of Commerce , 588 U. S., at 766\u2013768. \nAs those cases illustrate, to establish causation, the \nplaintiff must show a predictable chain of events leading from the government action to the asserted injury\u2014in other\nwords, that the government action has caused or likely will \ncause injury in fact to the plaintiff.\n2 \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n2In cases of alleged future injuri es to unregulated parties from \ngovernment regulation, the causat ion requirement and the imminence \nelement of the injury in fact requir ement can overlap.  Both target the \ns a m e  i s s u e : I s  i t  l i k e l y  t h a t  t h e government\u2019s regulation or lack of\nregulation of someone else will cause a concrete and particularized injury\nin fact to the unregulated plaintiff? \n   \n \n   \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n 13 Cite as: 602 U. S. ____ (2024) \nOpinion of the Court \nB \nHere, the plaintiff doctors and medical associations are\nunregulated parties who seek to challenge FDA\u2019s regulation \nof others . Specifically, FDA\u2019s regulations apply to doctors\nprescribing mifepristone and  to pregnant women taking\nmifepristone. But the plaintiff doctors and medical \nassociations do not prescribe or use mifepristone.  And FDA \nhas not required the plaintiffs to do anything or to refrain\nfrom doing anything.\nThe plaintiffs do not allege the kinds of injuries described \nabove that unregulated parties sometimes can assert to \ndemonstrate causation. Because the plaintiffs do not\nprescribe, manufacture, sell, or  advertise mifepristone or\nsponsor a competing drug, the plaintiffs suffer no direct \nmonetary injuries from FDA\u2019s actions relaxing regulation of \nmifepristone. Nor do they suffe r injuries to their property, \nor to the value of their property, from FDA\u2019s actions. Because the plaintiffs do not use mifepristone, they obviously can suffer no physical injuries from FDA\u2019s actions \nrelaxing regulation of mifepristone. \nRather, the plaintiffs say that they are pro-life, oppose \nelective abortion, and have sincere legal, moral, ideological, \nand policy objections to mifepristone being prescribed and used by others. The plaintiffs appear to recognize that those \ngeneral legal, moral, ideological, and policy concerns do not suffice on their own to confer Article III standing to sue in \nfederal court. So to try to es tablish standing, the plaintiffs\nadvance several complicated c ausation theories to connect \nFDA\u2019s actions to the plaintiffs\u2019 alleged injuries in fact. \nThe first set of causation theories contends that FDA\u2019s \nrelaxed regulation of mifepristone may cause downstream\nconscience injuries to the in dividual doctor plaintiffs and \nthe specified members of the plaintiff medical associations, \nwho are also doctors. (We will refer to them collectively as \n\u201cthe doctors.\u201d) The second set of causation theories asserts \nthat FDA\u2019s relaxed regulation of mifepristone may cause \n \n   \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n 14 FDA v. ALLIANCE FOR HIPPOCRATIC MEDICINE \nOpinion of the Court \ndownstream economic injuries to the doctors.  The third set \nof causation theories maintains that FDA\u2019s relaxed \nregulation of mifepristone causes injuries to the medical associations themselves, who assert their own \norganizational standing. As we will explain, none of the \ntheories suffices to establish Article III standing. \n1 \nWe first address the plaintiffs\u2019 claim that FDA\u2019s relaxed \nregulation of mifepristone causes conscience injuries to the \ndoctors. \nThe doctors contend that FDA\u2019s 2016 and 2021 actions \nwill cause more pregnant women to suffer complicationsfrom mifepristone, and those women in turn will need more \nemergency abortions by doctors. The plaintiff doctors say\nthat they therefore may be required\u2014against their consciences\u2014to render emergency treatment completing \nconscience injury of that kind  constitutes a concrete injury the abortions or providing other abortion-related \ntreatment. \nThe Government correctly acknowledges  that a \nin fact for purposes of Article III. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 11\u2013\n12; TransUnion , 594 U. S., at 425; see, e.g., Holt v. Hobbs , \n574 U. S. 352 (2015).  So doctors would have standing tochallenge a government action that likely would cause them\nto provide medical treatment against their consciences. \nBut in this case\u2014even assuming for the sake of argument \nthat FDA\u2019s 2016 and 2021 changes to mifepristone\u2019sconditions of use cause more pregnant women to require \nemergency abortions and that some women would likely \nseek treatment from these plaintiff doctors\u2014the plaintiff \ndoctors have not shown that they could be forced toparticipate in an abortion or provide abortion-related\nmedical treatment over their conscience objections.\nThat is because, as the Government explains, federal \nconscience laws definitively  protect doctors from being \n   \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n 15 Cite as: 602 U.

R. 4366, 118th Cong., 2d Sess., Div. C,Title II, \u00a7203 (2024). The Church Amendments, for \ninstance, speak clearly.  They allow doctors and other\nhealthcare personnel to \u201crefus[e] to perform or assist\u201d an\nabortion without punishment or discrimination from their\nemployers.  42 U. S. C. \u00a7300a\u20137(c)(1).  And the Church Amendments more broadly provide that doctors shall not be \nrequired to provide treatment or assistance that would \nviolate the doctors\u2019 religious beliefs or moral convictions. \u00a7300a\u20137(d). Most if not all States have conscience laws to \nthe same effect. See N. Sawi cki, Protections From Civil \nLiability in State Abortion Conscience Laws, 322 JAMA1918 (2019); see, e.g., Tex. Occ. Code Ann. \u00a7103.001 (West \n2022).\nMoreover, as the Government  notes, federal conscience \nprotections encompass \u201cthe doctor\u2019s beliefs rather than \nparticular procedures,\u201d meaning that doctors cannot be \nrequired to treat mifepristone complications in any way \nthat would violate the doctors\u2019 co nsciences.  Tr. of Oral Arg. \n37; see \u00a7300a\u20137(c)(1).  As the Government points out, that strong protection for conscience remains true even in a so-called healthcare desert, where other doctors are not \nreadily available. Tr. of Oral Arg. 18. \nNot only as a matter of law but also as a matter of fact,\nthe federal conscience laws have protected pro-life doctors ever since FDA approved mifepristone in 2000.

Chevron Deference Reversal: FDA Rulemaking and Legal Challenges After Loper Bright September 24, 2024 (6 min read) * The views expressed in externally authored materials linked or published on this site do not necessarily reflect the views of LexisNexis Legal & Professional. By:\u00a0Chad A. Landmon and\u00a0Suzanne E. Bassett, POLSINELLI PC THIS ARTICLE PROVIDES GUIDANCE ON THE IMPACT of the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s recent decisions in Loper Bright1 and Corner Post2 on decision-making by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). By Overruling Chevron3 deference to statutory interpretations made by federal agencies, the Supreme Court has likely opened the floodgates for legal challenges to regulations promulgated by the FDA and to final decisions rendered by the FDA. Regulated industries must be mindful of this new legal paradigm when advocating before the agency, in addition to being ready for the court challenges that will undoubtedly be initiated. This article discusses the following topics: Federal court jurisdiction under the Administrative Procedure Act Agency deference Loper Bright and Corner Post Industry best practices Federal Court Jurisdiction under the Administrative Procedure Act Administrative Procedure Act Section 702 of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA)4 grants federal courts jurisdiction to review actions taken by executive branch agencies. Section 706 of the APA5 states that the \u201creviewing court shall decide all relevant questions of law, interpret constitutional and statutory provisions, and determine the meaning or applicability of the terms of an agency action.\u201d Further, Section 706 directs reviewing courts to \u201ccompel agency action unlawfully withheld or unreasonably delayed\u201d6 and to \u201chold unlawful and set aside agency action, findings, and conclusions\u201d that are: Arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law Contrary to constitutional right, power, privilege, or immunity In excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or limitations, or short of statutory right Without observance of procedure required by law Unsupported by substantial evidence in a case concerning formal rulemaking and adjudicatory proceedings or otherwise reviewed on the record of an agency hearing provided by statute Unwarranted by the facts7 Defining a Final Agency Action Judicial review under the APA is limited to final agency actions. For an agency action to be final, and thus subject to judicial review, the action must: Mark the end of the agency\u2019s decision-making process, rather than a tentative or interlocutory action8 Determine rights or obligations, or result in legal consequences9 With respect to actions taken by the FDA, the following are examples of final agency actions: A response to a citizen\u2019s petition10 Interpretation of a statute that causes an Abbreviated New Drug Application applicant to lose its 180-day exclusivity11 Enforcement of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act through administrative procedures12 Issuance of rules and regulations through notice and comment rulemaking13 The following are examples of actions taken by the FDA deemed not to be final agency actions: Issuance of a notice of proposed rulemaking where the notice proposed a ban on an additive but stated that it would take no action14 Statements made in a preamble to final regulations15 Threats made during an in-person meeting to seize mislabeled products16 Agency Deference Section 706 of the APA17 authorizes a court to \u201chold unlawful and set aside agency action\u201d that it finds \u201carbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with the law.\u201d As a result, the APA makes judges the decision-makers of all questions of law properly before them and contemplates some level of deference if the agency\u2019s interpretation of the statute is reasonable (i.e., not arbitrary, capricious, or an abuse of discretion). To effectively carry out their statutory responsibilities, courts have created doctrinal tests to determine whether to give an agency\u2019s interpretation of a statute or regulation any deference.

FDA May Slow Down Rulemaking and Use Other Tools at its Disposal With more tools for companies to challenge FDA rulemaking, it is possible that FDA-regulated companies will see a slowdown in FDA rulemaking as the agency must now consider whether there is another permissible statutory interpretation. With less incentive to rely on the rulemaking process, the FDA may also rely more heavily on guidance documents, which do not carry the force of law, or individual enforcement actions against specific companies or products. As time progresses, it will be increasingly important to monitor the FDA landscape and any changes the agency takes to its regulatory approach. Chad A.

This essay summarizes the results of my review of those decisions. I have long considered standing doctrine to be incoherent, inconsistent, and unprincipled. The Justices use standing to further a wide variety of goals that are logically unrelated to standing.[1]\u00a0The Court\u2019s recent decisions have not changed my opinion. In\u00a0Collins v. Yellen,[2]\u00a0the conservative majority relied on a relaxed version of standing doctrine that allowed them to hold that shareholders in Fannie Mae and Freddy Mac had standing to argue that the statutory restriction on the power of the president to remove the head of the Federal Housing Finance Administration was unconstitutional. This was not a surprise. The conservative majority has long made it clear that it is determined to announce and apply new constitutional law doctrines that allow it to restructure the government by creating more \u201cofficers\u201d and making it easier for the president to remove many government officials. It has also made it clear that it will not allow doctrines like ripeness, finality, exhaustion or standing to get in the way of its implementation of that important ideological agenda.[3] The\u00a0Collins\u00a0majority then applied an interesting new version of the traceability component of the standing test as the basis for a holding that, while the shareholders had standing to make their argument, they were highly unlikely to obtain any real remedy as a result of their victory. The majority remanded the remedy question to the lower court with instructions to provide the shareholders a remedy for the violation of their constitutional rights only if the court finds a causal relationship between the violation of their rights and some agency action that caused an injury to the shareholders. The majority strongly suggested that the court could find such a causal relationship only in the highly unlikely event that it finds that the president would have removed the head of the agency for taking the action that injured the shareholders if he believed that he had an unrestricted power to remove the head of the agency. We are likely to see more opinions on remedies like the opinion in\u00a0Collins. The conservative majority is in the early stages of the process of learning that their radical campaign to restructure the government has the potential to create enormous practical problems. As those problems begin to become apparent, the conservative majority must find innovative ways of continuing their restructuring campaign without creating intolerable practical problems. The opinion in\u00a0U.S. v. Arthrex[4]\u00a0illustrates this trend. The majority first concluded that Administrative Patent Judges (APJs) would be principal officers if the majority applied its precedents to APJs because their decisions are not reviewable by any principal officer. The majority then seemed to realize that such a holding would create serious problems by adding several hundred more people to the long list of people who require Senate confirmation when the Senate is already experiencing great difficulty performing its duty to decide whether to confirm nominees for office. It avoided that unacceptable result by taking the radical step of amending the statute to confer on the head of the Patent and Trademark Appeal Board the power to review decisions of APJs\u2014a power that Congress never granted the head of the Board. That judicial rewriting of the statute allowed the majority to hold that the APJs are inferior officers because their decisions are subject to review by a principal officer. In\u00a0Uzuegbunam v. Prezenski,[5]\u00a0the Court held that the potential to obtain nominal damages is sufficient to satisfy the requirement that an injury must be redressable to qualify a plaintiff for standing when the plaintiff alleges a violation of his rights to free speech and religion. Yet, the Court has held that the potential to be awarded many thousand dollars in legal fees is not sufficient to qualify as redress for an injury to a plaintiff\u2019s ability to protect his health.[6]\u00a0It seems clear that a majority of Justices believe that it is more important to protect individuals\u2019 rights to speech and religion than to protect their rights to protect their health. That is a defensible value judgment, but it has no logical relationship with the question of who has standing to sue or what it takes to redress an injury. In\u00a0Transunion v. Ramirez,[7]\u00a0a five-Justice majority held that people whose credit reports contained false statements that strongly suggest that they are terrorists lacked standing to sue the company that negligently prepared the reports. The majority held that the victims of the false reports suffered no \u201cconcrete\u201d injury because the company that negligently prepared the reports had not yet provided them to a third party. As a result, the plaintiffs could not maintain a cause of action against the company even though Congress had clearly and explicitly authorized anyone who is the subject of a false credit report to sue the company that was responsible for the false report. Some people believe that this opinion is an unequivocal and durable holding that Congress cannot create standing to sue for violation of a statutory right unless a court finds that violation of the statute causes a \u201cconcrete\u201d injury to the victim of the violation. I am skeptical that the opinion will bear that meaning over time for two reasons. First, as the cases discussed in the dissenting opinion illustrate, the Court has issued many opinions that address the question whether Congress can create a cause of action for violation of a statute. Those opinions are not a model of consistency.\u00a0 At least two of the Court\u2019s prior opinions seem to stand for the proposition that Congress has the power to create standing by creating a statutory right and conferring standing to vindicate that right on a private party who is injured in some way as a result of a violation of the right created by the statute[8]\u00a0\u2014 the opposite of the holding in\u00a0Transunion. I suspect that the\u00a0Transunion\u00a0opinion will become just one more of the many inconsistent opinions that address the issue. Second, Justice Thomas wrote a dissenting opinion in\u00a0Transunion\u00a0that attacks the reasoning of the majority in ways that will make it difficult to defend the reasoning and holding of the case over time. He explained why the defendant\u2019s action violated three private rights held by the plaintiffs. He then accused the majority of making up the requirement that an injury must be \u201cconcrete\u201d to qualify a plaintiff for standing. The case or controversy clause in Article III contains no reference to the need to vindicate a right that a court considers to be \u201cconcrete.\u201d He concluded by accusing the majority of judicial aggrandizement based on its view that a court can decide that an injury to a private right is not important enough to support a lawsuit when Congress has decided that the injury is sufficiently important to give rise to a case or controversy that a court can resolve. In\u00a0California v. Texas,[9]\u00a0the Court held that standing precluded the Court from deciding whether the Affordable Care Act (ACA) was unconstitutional after Congress amended it by eliminating its potential to raise revenue, thereby arguably undermining the sole basis on which the Court had earlier held that Congress had the power to enact the ACA. The majority held that none of the states and none of the individuals who sought to challenge the validity of the amended statute were injured\u00a0by the amendment\u00a0that eliminated the potential for the statute to raise revenues. The majority declined to consider the argument that\u00a0the statute as amended\u00a0injured the states or individuals. As the two dissenting Justices pointed out, that was the appropriate question to ask for purposes of deciding whether the states or individuals had standing to argue that the amended statute was unconstitutional, and it was easy to conclude that the amended statute injured both the individuals and the states. The majority opinion in\u00a0California v. Texas\u00a0is peculiar in another way as well. In\u00a0Massachusetts v. EPA,[10]\u00a0the Court held that standing has \u201cspecial solicitude\u201d for states. It went on to hold that Massachusetts had standing when an individual, association or corporation would not have had standing. The dissenting Justices relied in part on the special status of states that the Court had previously recognized, but the majority ignored that part of standing law entirely without even bothering to explain why they did not extend \u201cspecial solicitude\u201d to the states that sought to challenge the constitutionality of the amended ACA. The majority opinion leaves us with no way of knowing whether the special status of states in standing disputes is gone permanently or has only lapsed briefly for purposes of this case. If the majority\u2019s reasoning and holding on standing in\u00a0California v. Texas\u00a0was based on a result-oriented distortion of standing law, as I believe, that raises an obvious question: why did the majority rely on a distorted version of standing law to dispose of the case. I have an easy answer. The Court wanted to avoid the nasty debate among the Justices about the constitutionality of the ACA that would have been inevitable if it had held that the anyone had standing to challenge the constitutionality of the amended ACA. That debate would divide the Justices along political lines, thereby giving more ammunition to the critics of the Court who see the Court as a purely political institution. Moreover, such a debate would not change the outcome of the case because the Justices who argued that the amended statute was unconstitutional would then have relied on the Court\u2019s standard method of resolving severability disputes as the basis for a holding that the amendment could be severed from the rest of the statute, thereby leaving the ACA in effect. In\u00a0Department of Commerce v. New York,[11]\u00a0the Court held that a court can decide whether an alleged future injury qualifies for standing by applying either of two tests\u2014the nearly-impossible-to-satisfy \u201ccertainly impending\u201d test that the Court announced in\u00a0Clapper v. Amnesty\u00a0International[12]\u00a0or the easy-to-satisfy \u201csubstantial risk\u201d of occurrence test that preceded\u00a0Clapper. Why would the Court give lower courts a choice between applying an easy-to-satisfy test or a nearly-impossible-to satisfy test to resolve an important issue that arises in many standing cases? That question is easy to answer based on the facts of\u00a0Clapper. Journalists sought to challenge the constitutionality of a government surveillance system. They argued that they had standing because the surveillance system interfered with their rights by discouraging sources of information from talking to them. The government took the position that the surveillance system did not exist, and that any future injury that might be caused by such a system was too speculative to support standing. In that context, the Court applied the new \u201ccertainly impending\u201d test as the basis for its holding that it could not decide whether the surveillance system was constitutional. The reason the Court announced and applied an impossible-to-satisfy test in\u00a0Clapper\u00a0is obvious. The Court did not want to decide whether the surveillance system was illegal. The Justices must have been embarrassed a few months after the\u00a0Clapper\u00a0decision when the government publicly acknowledged that it had been implementing the surveillance system for years at the time that the Court questioned its existence and characterized its harmful effects as unduly speculative. By the time the Court decided\u00a0Department of Commerce v. New York, the Court had reconsidered the Clapper\u00a0test and decided to return to the pre-Clapper\u00a0test. That takes me to the Court\u2019s most recent foray into standing law. On September 1, 2021, s five-Justice majority refused to issue a stay that would have temporarily precluded Texas from implementing a new statute that had the immediate effect of banning all abortions after the first six weeks of a pregnancy.[13]\u00a0The statute accomplished that result by authorizing anyone to file a civil action against anyone who \u201caids or abets\u201d the performance of such an abortion in a state court and instructing the state judge to award $10,000 in damages in each such case. The actual reason for the decision is obvious. The five Justices who refused to stay implementation of the statute oppose abortion. They were content to allow a state to implement a statute that is clearly inconsistent with\u00a0Roe v. Wade[14]\u00a0without incurring the wrath of the majority of the public that favors a right to abortion by overturning\u00a0Roe. The majority accomplished that result by saying that it was not addressing the merits of the case. In a strange one paragraph opinion, the majority referred to \u201cprocedural problems\u201d that precluded it from staying implementation of the statute. The majority did not refer to standing, but it cited\u00a0Clapper\u00a0and quoted the \u201ccertainly impending\u201d test in a parenthetical following that citation.\u00a0 That citation implies that the majority could not stay implementation of the Texas statute because no petitioner could satisfy the test to determine whether they have standing based on a future injury. There are two problems with the reasoning of the majority in the Texas abortion case. First, the\u00a0Clapper\u00a0test is irrelevant after the Court\u2019s decision in\u00a0Department of Commerce v. New York. A petitioner who relies on an alleged future injury as the basis for standing needs only to satisfy the easy-to-satisfy pre-Clapper\u00a0test by showing that there is a \u201csubstantial risk\u201d that the petitioner will suffer a future injury. Second, it is easy to show that anyone who is over six weeks pregnant who wants an abortion in Texas was injured immediately by implementation of the Texas statute. Clinics that had scheduled such abortions immediately announced that they would no longer provide such abortions and turned away patients who were scheduled for the procedure. It is obvious that the majority\u2019s reliance on standing to bar anyone from challenging the constitutionality of the Texas abortion statute was a fabrication. The majority hoped to use a distorted version of standing law to explain why it was acting in a way that makes it impossible for a woman who is more than six weeks pregnant to obtain an abortion without having the courage to overrule\u00a0Roe v. Wade. It will be interesting to see how the Court reacts to a request to stay a state statute that authorizes anyone to obtain $10,000 in civil damages from anyone who owns a gun. The Texas abortion statute raises an obvious standing problem of a completely different type. Any person who files a civil action for damages against someone who aids or abets an abortion because the plaintiff disapproves of abortion would have no chance of satisfying the requirement that they have suffered a \u201cparticularized\u201d injury. Thus, any such suit would be dismissed based on lack of standing if it was brought in a federal court. Article III does not apply in state courts, however, and it is highly unlikely that the elected members of the Texas Supreme Court will refuse to give effect to the Texas statute based on standing.

See United States  v. Detroit Timber & Lumber Co.,  200 U. S. 321, 337. \nSUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES \nSyllabus \nFOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION ET AL . v. \nALLIANCE FOR HIPPOCRATIC MEDICINE ET AL . \nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR \nTHE FIFTH CIRCUIT \nNo. 23\u2013235. Argued March 26, 2024\u2014Decided June 13, 2024* \nIn 2000, the Food and Drug Administration approved a new drug\napplication for mifepristone tablet s marketed under the brand name\nMifeprex for use in terminating pregnancies up to seven weeks.  To \nhelp ensure that Mifeprex would be used safely and effectively, FDA \nplaced additional restrictions on the drug\u2019s use and distribution, for \nexample requiring doctors to prescribe  or to supervise prescription of\nMifeprex, and requiring pa tients to have three in-person visits with \nthe doctor to receive the drug.  In 2016, FDA relaxed some of these \nrestrictions: deeming Mifeprex safe to terminate pregnancies up to 10 \nweeks; allowing healthcare providers,  such as nurse practitioners, to\nprescribe Mifeprex; and approving a do sing regimen that required just\none in-person visit to receive the drug.  In 2019, FDA approved an application for generic mifepristone.  In 2021, FDA announced that it would no longer enforce the initial in-person visit requirement.  Four \npro-life medical associations and se veral individual doctors moved for \na preliminary injunction that woul d require FDA either to rescind\napproval of mifepristone or to rescind FDA\u2019s 2016 and 2021 regulatoryactions. Danco Laboratories, which sponsors Mifeprex, intervened to \ndefend FDA\u2019s actions. \nThe District Court agreed with the plaintiffs and in effect enjoined \nFDA\u2019s approval of mifepristone, ther eby ordering mifepristone off the \nmarket. FDA and Danco appealed and moved to stay the DistrictCourt\u2019s order pending appeal.  As relevant here, this Court ultimately \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n*Together with No. 23\u2013236, Danco Laboratories, L.L.C.  v.

ALLIANCE FOR HIPPOCRATIC MEDICINE \nSyllabus \nstayed the District Court\u2019s order pending the disposition of \nproceedings in the Fifth Circuit and this Court.  On the merits, the \nFifth Circuit held that plaintiffs had standing.  It concluded that plaintiffs were unlikely to succeed on their challenge to FDA\u2019s 2000 and 2019 drug approvals, but were likely to succeed in showing that\nFDA\u2019s 2016 and 2021 actions were unlawful.  This Court granted\ncertiorari with respect to the 2016 and 2021 FDA actions. \nHeld : Plaintiffs lack Article III stan ding to challenge FDA\u2019s actions \nregarding the regulation of mifepristone.  Pp. 5\u201325.\n(a) Article III standing is a \u201cbedro ck constitutional requirement that \nthis Court has applied to all manner of important disputes.\u201d  United \nStates v. Texas , 599 U. S. 670, 675.  Standing is \u201cbuilt on a single basic\nidea\u2014the idea of separation of powers.\u201d Ibid. Article III confines the \njurisdiction of federal courts to \u201cCases\u201d and \u201cControversies.\u201d  Federal \ncourts do not operate as an open forum for citizens \u201cto press general \ncomplaints about the way in wh ich government goes about its \nbusiness.\u201d  Allen v. Wright , 468 U. S. 737, 760.  To obtain a judicial\ndetermination of what the governing law is, a plaintiff must have a \u201cpersonal stake\u201d in the dispute.  TransUnion LLC  v. Ramirez , 594 \nU. S. 413, 423. \nTo establish standing, a plaintiff must demonstrate (i) that she has\nsuffered or likely will suffer an injury in fact, (ii) that the injury likely \nwas caused or will be caused by the defendant, and (iii) that the injury \nlikely would be redressed by the requested judicial relief. See \nSummers  v. Earth Island Institute , 555 U. S. 488, 493. The two key \nquestions in most standing disputes are injury in fact and causation. By requiring the plaintiff to show an injury in fact, Article III standing screens out plaintiffs who might have only a general legal, moral, \nideological, or policy objection to a particular government action. \nCausation requires the plaintiff to establish that the plaintiff \u2019s injury \nlikely was caused or likely will be ca used by the defendant\u2019s conduct. \nCausation is \u201cordinarily substantially more difficult to establish\u201d when \n(as here) a plaintiff challenges the government\u2019s \u201cunlawful regulation \n(or lack of regulation) of someone else.\u201d Lujan  v. Defenders of Wildlife , \n504 U. S. 555, 560\u2013561.  That is be cause unregulated parties often may\nhave more difficulty linking their a sserted injuries to the government\u2019s \nregulation (or lack of regulation) of someone else.  Pp. 5\u201312.\n(b) Plaintiffs are pro-life, oppose elective abortion, and have sincere\nlegal, moral, ideological, and policy objections to mifepristone being\nprescribed and used by others .  Because plaintiffs do not prescribe or \nuse mifepristone, plaintiffs are unregulated parties who seek to \nchallenge FDA\u2019s regulation of others . Plaintiffs advance several \ncomplicated causation theories to  connect FDA\u2019s actions to the \nplaintiffs\u2019 alleged injuries in fact. None of these theories suffices to \n  \n \n \n   \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n    \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n   3 Cite as: 602 U. S. ____ (2024) \nSyllabus \nestablish Article III standing.  Pp. 13\u201324.\n(1) Plaintiffs first contend th at FDA\u2019s relaxed regulation of \nmifepristone may cause downstream conscience injuries to the \nindividual doctors.  Even assuming that FDA\u2019s 2016 and 2021 changes to mifepristone\u2019s conditions of use cause more pregnant women to \nrequire emergency abortions and that some women would likely seek\ntreatment from these plaintiff doctors, the plaintiff doctors have not shown that they could be forced to participate in an abortion or provide \nabortion-related medical treatment over their conscience objections. Federal conscience laws definiti vely protect doctors from being \nrequired to perform abortions or to provide other treatment that \nviolates their consciences. Federal law protects doctors from repercussions when they have \u201crefused \u201d to participate in an abortion. \n\u00a7300a\u20137(c)(1).  The plaintiffs have not identified any instances where \na doctor was required, notwithstanding conscience objections, to\nperform an abortion or to provide other abortion-related treatment that violated the doctor\u2019s conscience since mifepristone\u2019s 2000 approval.  Further, the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act \n(or EMTALA) neither overrides federal conscience laws nor requires \nindividual emergency room doctor s to participate in emergency \nabortions.  Thus, there is a break in any chain of causation between\nFDA\u2019s relaxed regulation of mifepristone and any asserted conscience \ninjuries to the doctors.  Pp. 14\u201317. \n(2) Plaintiffs next assert they have standing because FDA\u2019s\nrelaxed regulation of mifepristone  may cause downstream economic\ninjuries to the doctors.  The doctors cite various monetary and related injuries that they will allegedly suffe r as a result of FDA\u2019s actions\u2014in\nparticular, diverting resources and ti me from other patients to treat \npatients with mifepristone complic ations; increasing risk of liability\nsuits from treating those patien ts; and potentially increasing\ninsurance costs.  But the causal link between FDA\u2019s regulatory actionsin 2016 and 2021 and those alleged injuries is too speculative, lacks support in the record, and is othe rwise too attenuated to establish \nstanding.  Moreover, the law has ne ver permitted doctors to challenge\nthe government\u2019s loosening of general public safety requirementssimply because more individuals mi ght then show up at emergency \nrooms or in doctors\u2019 offices with follow-on injuries. Citizens and doctors who object to what the law a llows others to do may always take\ntheir concerns to the Executive an d Legislative Branches and seek \ngreater regulatory or legislative restrictions.  Pp. 18\u201321.\n(3) Plaintiff medical associations assert their own organizational \nstanding.  Under the Court\u2019s precedents, organizations may have \nstanding \u201cto sue on their own behalf for injuries they have sustained,\u201d \nHavens Realty Corp.  v. Coleman , 455 U. S. 363, 379, n. 19, but \n \n   \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 4 FDA v. ALLIANCE FOR HIPPOCRATIC MEDICINE \nSyllabus \norganizations must satisfy the usual standards for injury in fact, \ncausation, and redressability that apply to individuals, id., at 378\u2013379. \nAccording to the medical associations, FDA has \u201cimpaired\u201d their\u201cability to provide services and achiev e their organizational missions.\u201d\nBrief for Respondents 43.  That argument does not work to \ndemonstrate standing.  Like an individual, an organization may not \nestablish standing simply based on  the \u201cintensity of the litigant\u2019s \ninterest\u201d or because of strong opposition to the government\u2019s conduct, \nValley Forge Christian College  v. Americans United for Separation of \nChurch and State, Inc. , 454 U. S. 464, 486.  The plaintiff associations \ntherefore cannot establish standing simply because they object to FDA\u2019s actions.  The medical associations claim to have standing based \non their incurring costs to oppose FDA\u2019s actions.  They say that FDA has \u201ccaused\u201d the associations to conduct their own studies on \nmifepristone so that the associatio ns can better inform their members\nand the public about mifepristone\u2019s risks.  Brief for Respondents 43. \nThey contend that FDA has \u201cforce d\u201d the associations to \u201cexpend\nconsiderable time, energy, and resources\u201d drafting citizen petitions toFDA, as well as engaging in public advocacy and public education, all\nto the detriment of other spending priorities.  Id., at 44. But an \norganization that has not suffered a concrete injury caused by a defendant\u2019s action cannot spend its way into standing simply by expending money to gather inform ation and advocate against the \ndefendant\u2019s action.  Contrary to  what the medical associations \ncontend, the Court\u2019s decision in Havens Realty Corp.  v. Coleman does \nnot stand for the expansive theory that standing exists when an \norganization diverts its resources in response to a defendant\u2019s actions. Havens  was an unusual case, and this Court has been careful not to \nextend the Havens  holding beyond its context.  So too here. \nFinally, it was suggested that plai ntiffs must have standing because \notherwise it may be that no one would have standing to challenge \nFDA\u2019s 2016 and 2021 actions.  That suggestion fails because the Court \nhas long rejected that kind of argument as a basis for standing.  The \u201cassumption\u201d that if these plaintif fs lack \u201cstanding to sue, no one \nwould have standing, is not a reason to find standing.\u201d  Schlesinger  v. \nReservists Comm. to Stop the War , 418 U. S. 208, 227.  Rather, some \nissues may be left to the political and democratic processes.

Those changes made it easier for doctors to \nprescribe and pregnant women to obtain mifepristone.\nSeveral pro-life doctors and associations sued FDA, arguing\nthat FDA\u2019s actions violated the Administrative Procedure Act. But the plaintiffs do not prescribe or use mifepristone.\nAnd FDA is not requiring them to do or refrain from doing\nanything. Rather, the plaintiffs want FDA to make mifepristone more difficult for other doctors to prescribe \nand for pregnant women to obtain.  Under Article III of the Constitution, a plaintiff \u2019s desire to make a drug less\navailable for others does not establish standing to sue. Nor \ndo the plaintiffs\u2019 other standing theories suffice.  Therefore, \nthe plaintiffs lack standing to challenge FDA\u2019s actions. \n \n   \n   \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 2 FDA v. ALLIANCE FOR HIPPOCRATIC MEDICINE \nOpinion of the Court \nI \nA \nUnder federal law, the U. S. Food and Drug\nAdministration, an agency within the Executive Branch, \nensures that drugs on the market are safe and effective. \nFor FDA to approve a new drug, the drug sponsor (usually \nthe drug\u2019s manufacturer or potential marketer) must \nsubmit an application demonstrating that the drug is safeand effective when used as directed.  21 U. S. C. \u00a7355(d). \nThe sponsor\u2019s application must  generally include proposed \nlabeling that specifies the drug\u2019s dosage, how to take the\ndrug, and the specific conditio ns that the drug may treat.\n21 CFR \u00a7\u00a7201.5, 314.50 (2022). \nIf FDA determines that additional safety requirements\nare necessary, FDA may impose extra requirements on prescription and use of the drug.  21 U. S. C. \u00a7355\u20131(f )(3).  \nFor example, FDA may require that prescribers undergo \nspecialized training; mandate that the drug be dispensed \nonly in certain settings like hospitals; or direct that doctors\nmonitor patients taking the drug.  Ibid. \nIn 2000, FDA approved a new drug application for\nmifepristone tablets marketed under the brand name \nMifeprex. FDA approved Mifeprex for use to terminate pregnancies, but only up to seven weeks of pregnancy.  To \nhelp ensure that Mifeprex would be used safely and\neffectively, FDA placed further restrictions on the drug\u2019suse and distribution. For example, only doctors could \nprescribe or supervise prescri ption of Mifeprex.  Doctors \nand patients also had to follo w a strict regimen requiring\nthe patient to appear for three in-person visits with the\ndoctor. And FDA directed pres cribing doctors to report\nincidents of hospitalizations, blood transfusions, or other \nserious adverse events to the drug sponsor (who, in turn, \nwas required to report the events to FDA).\nIn 2015, Mifeprex\u2019s distributor Danco Laboratories \nsubmitted a supplemental new drug application seeking to \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 3 Cite as: 602 U. S. ____ (2024) \nOpinion of the Court \namend Mifeprex\u2019s labeling and to relax some of the restrictions that FDA had imposed.  In 2016, FDA approved \nthe proposed changes. FDA deemed Mifeprex safe to\nterminate pregnancies up to 10 weeks rather than 7 weeks. \nFDA allowed healthcare providers such as nurse practitioners to prescribe Mi feprex.  And FDA approved a\ndosing regimen that reduce d the number of required in-\nperson visits from three to one\u2014a single visit to receive Mifeprex. In addition, FDA changed prescribers\u2019 adverse\nevent reporting obligations to require prescribers to report\nonly fatalities\u2014a reporting requirement that was still more stringent than the requirements for most other drugs.\nIn 2019, FDA approved an application for generic \nmifepristone. FDA established the same conditions of use \nfor generic mifepristo ne as for Mifeprex. \nIn 2021, FDA again relaxed the requirements for \nMifeprex and generic mifepristo ne.  Relying on experience \ngained during the COVID\u201319 pandemic about pregnant \nwomen using mifepristone without an in-person visit to a \nhealthcare provider, FDA announced that it would nolonger enforce the initial in-person visit requirement. \nB \nBecause mifepristone is used to terminate pregnancies,\nFDA\u2019s approval and regulation of mifepristone have\ngenerated substantial controversy from the start. In 2002, \nthree pro-life associations subm itted a joint citizen petition\nasking FDA to rescind its approval of Mifeprex. FDA \ndenied their petition.\nIn 2019, two pro-life medical associations filed another\npetition, this time asking  FDA to withdraw its 2016 \nmodifications to mifepristone\u2019s conditions of use.  FDA \ndenied that petition as well. \nThis case began in 2022. Four pro-life medical\nassociations, as well as seve ral individual doctors, sued \nFDA in the U. S. District Court for the Northern District of \n \n   \n  \n  \n \n  \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n 4 FDA v. ALLIANCE FOR HIPPOCRATIC MEDICINE \nOpinion of the Court \nTexas. Plaintiffs brought claims under the Administrative \nProcedure Act.  They challe nged the lawfulness of FDA\u2019s \n2000 approval of Mifeprex; FD A\u2019s 2019 approval of generic \nmifepristone; and FDA\u2019s 2016 and 2021 actions modifying mifepristone\u2019s conditions of use.  Danco Laboratories, which \nsponsors Mifeprex, intervened to defend FDA\u2019s actions.\nThe plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction that\nwould require FDA to rescind approval of mifepristone or, at the very least, to rescind FDA\u2019s 2016 and 2021 actions. \nThe District Court agreed with the plaintiffs and in effect\nenjoined FDA\u2019s approval of mifepristone, thereby ordering mifepristone off the market.  668 F. Supp. 3d 507 (ND Tex. \n2023). The court first held that the plaintiffs possessed\nArticle III standing.  It then determined that the plaintiffs\nwere likely to succeed on the merits of each of their claims.\nFinally, the court concluded that the plaintiffs would suffer irreparable harm from FDA\u2019s continued approval of\nmifepristone and that an injunction would serve the public\ninterest. \nFDA and Danco promptly appealed and moved to stay the\nDistrict Court\u2019s order pending appeal.  The U. S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit granted the stay motion in \npart and temporarily reinstated FDA\u2019s approval of \nMifeprex. 2023 WL 2913725, *21 (Apr. 12, 2023).  But the \nCourt of Appeals declined to st ay the rest of the District\nCourt\u2019s order.  The Court of Appeals\u2019 partial stay would\nhave left Mifeprex (though not generic mifepristone) on the \nmarket, but only under the more stringent requirements \nimposed when FDA first approved Mifeprex in 2000\u2014\navailable only up to seven weeks of pregnancy, only when\nprescribed by doctors, and only with three in-person visits,among other requirements.\nFDA and Danco then sought a full stay in this Court.\nThis Court stayed the District Court\u2019s order in its entirety\npending the disposition of FDA\u2019s and Danco\u2019s appeals in the \nCourt of Appeals and ultimate re solution by this Court.  598 \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n 5 Cite as: 602 U.

As a result of this Court\u2019s stay, Mifeprex\nand generic mifepristone have remained available as \nallowed by FDA\u2019s relaxed 2016 and 2021 requirements.\nA few months later, the Court of Appeals issued its\ndecision on the merits of the District Court\u2019s order, affirming in part and vacating in part. 78 F. 4th 210, 222\u2013 \n223 (CA5 2023).  The Court of Appeals first concluded that \nthe individual doctors and the pro-life medical associations had standing. The Court of Appeals next concluded that \nplaintiffs were not likely to succeed on their challenge to\nFDA\u2019s 2000 approval of Mifeprex and 2019 approval of \ngeneric mifepristone. So the Court of Appeals vacated the \nDistrict Court\u2019s order as to those agency actions.  But the Court of Appeals agreed with the District Court that \nplaintiffs were likely to succeed in showing that FDA\u2019s 2016\nand 2021 actions were unlawful. \nThe Court of Appeals\u2019 merits  decision did not alter this \nCourt\u2019s stay of the District Court\u2019s order pending thisCourt\u2019s review.

Texas , 599 U. S. 670, \n675 (2023).  Standing is \u201cbuilt on a single basic idea\u2014the idea of separation of powers.\u201d  Ibid.  (quotation marks\nomitted). Importantly, separa tion of powers \u201cwas not\nsimply an abstract generalization in the minds of the\nFramers: it was woven into the document that they drafted \nin Philadelphia in the summer of 1787.\u201d TransUnion LLC \nv.

ALLIANCE FOR HIPPOCRATIC MEDICINE \nOpinion of the Court \ntext of the Constitution. \nArticle III of the Constitution confines the jurisdiction of \nfederal courts to \u201cCases\u201d and \u201cControversies.\u201d  The case or \ncontroversy requirement limits the role of the Federal \nJudiciary in our system of separated powers.  As this Court \nexplained to President George Washington in 1793 in\nresponse to his request for a legal opinion, federal courts do\nnot issue advisory opinions about the law\u2014even when requested by the President. 13 Papers of George\nWashington: Presidential Series 392 (C. Patrick ed. 2007).\nNor do federal courts operate as  an open forum for citizens \n\u201cto press general complaints about the way in which \ngovernment goes about its business.\u201d  Allen v. Wright , 468 \nU. S. 737, 760 (1984) (quotation marks omitted); see \nCalifornia v. Texas , 593 U. S. 659, 673 (2021); Valley Forge \nChristian College  v.

S. 126, 129\u2013130 (1922). \nAs Justice Scalia memorably said, Article III requires a\nplaintiff to first answer a basic question:  \u201c \u2018What\u2019s it to \nyou?\u2019 \u201d  A. Scalia, The Doctrine of Standing as an Essential \nElement of the Separation of Powers, 17 Suffolk U. L. Rev. 881, 882 (1983).  For a plaintiff to get in the federal\ncourthouse door and obtain a judicial determination of what \nthe governing law is, the plaintiff cannot be a mere\nbystander, but instead must hav e a \u201cpersonal stake\u201d in the \ndispute. TransUnion , 594 U. S., at 423.  The requirement\nthat the plaintiff possess a pers onal stake helps ensure that \ncourts decide litigants\u2019 legal rights in specific cases, as\nArticle III requires, and that courts do not opine on legal \nissues in response to citizens who might \u201croam the countryin search of governmental wrongdoing.\u201d  Valley Forge , 454 \nU. S., at 487; see, e.g., Schlesinger  v. Reservists Comm. to \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 7 Cite as: 602 U. S. ____ (2024) \nOpinion of the Court \nStop the War , 418 U.

Standing also \u201ctends to assure that\nthe legal questions presented to the court will be resolved, \nnot in the rarified atmosphere of a debating society, but in a concrete factual context conducive to a realistic \nappreciation of the consequences of judicial action.\u201d  Valley \nForge , 454 U. S., at 472.  Moreover, the standing doctrine\nserves to protect the \u201cautonomy\u201d of those who are most \ndirectly affected so that they can decide whether and how to challenge the defendant\u2019s action.  Id., at 473. \nBy limiting who can sue, the standing requirement\nimplements \u201cthe Framers\u2019 concept of the proper\u2014and\nproperly limited\u2014role of the courts in a democratic society.\u201d\nJ. Roberts, Article III Limits on Statutory Standing, 42\nDuke L. J. 1219, 1220 (1993) (quotation marks omitted).  In \nparticular, the standing requirement means that thefederal courts decide some contested legal questions later \nrather than sooner, thereby allowing issues to percolate and \npotentially be resolved by the political branches in the democratic process.  See Raines v. Byrd , 521 U. S. 811, 829\u2013 \n830 (1997); cf. Clapper v. Amnesty Int\u2019l USA , 568 U. S. 398, \n420\u2013422 (2013). And the standing requirement means that \nthe federal courts may never n eed to decide some contested \nlegal questions: \u201cOur system of government leaves many crucial decisions to the political processes,\u201d where \ndemocratic debate can occur and a wide variety of interests and views can be weighed. Schlesinger , 418 U. S., at 227; \nsee Campbell v. Clinton , 203 F. 3d 19, 23 (CADC 2000). \nA \nThe fundamentals of standing are well-known and firmly \nrooted in American constitutional law. To establish \nstanding, as this Court has often stated, a plaintiff must\ndemonstrate (i) that she has suffered or likely will suffer an injury in fact, (ii) that the injury likely was caused or will \n \n   \n  \n \n  \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n 8 FDA v. ALLIANCE FOR HIPPOCRATIC MEDICINE \nOpinion of the Court \nbe caused by the defendant, and (iii) that the injury likely \nwould be redressed by the requested judicial relief. See \nSummers  v. Earth Island Institute , 555 U. S. 488, 493 \n(2009); Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife , 504 U. S. 555, 560\u2013 \n561 (1992). Those specific standing requirements constitute \u201can essential and unchanging part of the case-or-\ncontroversy requirement of Article III.\u201d  Id., at 560. \nThe second and third standing requirements\u2014causation \nand redressability\u2014are often \u201cflip sides of the same coin.\u201d Sprint Communications Co.  v. APCC Services, Inc. , 554 \nU. S. 269, 288 (2008).  If a defendant\u2019s action causes an \ninjury, enjoining the action or awarding damages for the action will typically redress that injury.  So the two key \nquestions in most standing disputes are injury in fact and \ncausation.\n1 \nFirst  is injury in fact. An injury in fact must be\n\u201cconcrete,\u201d meaning that it must be real and not abstract.See TransUnion , 594 U. S., at 424.  The injury also must be\nparticularized; the injury must affect \u201cthe plaintiff in a personal and individual way\u201d  and not be a generalized\ngrievance. Lujan, 504 U. S., at 560, n. 1.  An injury in fact \ncan be a physical injury, a monetary injury, an injury to one\u2019s property, or an injury to one\u2019s constitutional rights, to \ntake just a few common examples. Moreover, the injury\nmust be actual or imminent, not speculative\u2014meaning that \nthe injury must have already occurred or be likely to occur soon. Clapper, 568 U. S., at 409.  And when a plaintiff seeks\nprospective relief such as an in junction, the plaintiff must\nestablish a sufficient likelihood of future injury.  Id., at 401. \nBy requiring the plaintiff to show an injury in fact, Article \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n1Redressability can still pose an inde pendent bar in some cases. For \nexample, a plaintiff who suffers injuri es caused by the government still \nmay not be able to sue because the case may not be of the kind \n\u201ctraditionally redressabl e in federal court.\u201d  United States v. Texas , 599 \nU. S. 670, 676 (2023); cf. California v. Texas , 593 U. S. 659, 671\u2013672 \n(2021). \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n   \n \n  \n \n \n 9 Cite as: 602 U. S. ____ (2024) \nOpinion of the Court \nIII standing screens out plaintiffs who might have only a\ngeneral legal, moral, ideological, or policy objection to a \nparticular government action.  For example, a citizen doesnot have standing to challeng e a government regulation \nsimply because the plaintiff believes that the governmentis acting illegally.  See Valley Forge , 454 U. S., at 473, 487. \nA citizen may not sue based only on an \u201casserted right tohave the Government act in accordance with law.\u201d Allen, \n468 U. S., at 754; Schlesinger , 418 U. S., at 225\u2013227.  Nor \nmay citizens sue merely because their legal objection isaccompanied by a strong moral, ideological, or policy\nobjection to a government action. See Valley Forge, 454 \nU. S., at 473. \nThe injury in fact requirement prevents the federal \ncourts from becoming a \u201cvehic le for the vindication of the\nvalue interests of concerned bystanders.\u201d  Allen, 468 U. S., \nat 756 (quotation marks omitted).  An Article III court is \nnot a legislative assembly, a town square, or a faculty \nlounge. Article III does not contemplate a system where\n330 million citizens can come to federal court whenever \nthey believe that the government is acting contrary to the\nConstitution or other federal law.  See id., at 754. \nVindicating \u201cthe public  interest (including the public\ninterest in Government observ ance of the Constitution and \nlaws) is the function of Congress and the Chief Executive.\u201d Lujan, 504 U. S., at 576. \nIn sum, to sue in federal court, a plaintiff must show that\nhe or she has suffered or likely will suffer an injury in fact. \nSecond is causation. The plaintiff must also establish\nthat the plaintiff \u2019s injury likely was caused or likely will be \ncaused by the defendant\u2019s conduct. \nGovernment regulations that require or forbid some\naction by the plaintiff almost invariably satisfy both the\ninjury in fact and causation requirements. So in those cases, standing is usually easy to establish.  See Lujan, 504 \nU. S., at 561\u2013562; see, e .g., Susan B. Anthony List  v. \n \n   \n  \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n   \n 10 FDA v. ALLIANCE FOR HIPPOCRATIC MEDICINE \nOpinion of the Court \nDriehaus , 573 U. S. 149, 162\u2013163 (2014). \nBy contrast, when (as here) a plaintiff challenges the \ngovernment\u2019s \u201cunlawful regulation (or lack of regulation) of \nsomeone else ,\u201d \u201cstanding is not precluded, but it is ordinarily \nsubstantially more difficult to establish.\u201d Lujan, 504 U. S., \nat 562 (quotation marks omitted); see Summers , 555 U. S., \nat 493. That is often because unregulated parties may have \nmore difficulty establishing causation\u2014that is, linking\ntheir asserted injuries to the government\u2019s regulation (or \nlack of regulation) of someone else.  See Clapper, 568 U. S., \nat 413\u2013414; Lujan, 504 U. S., at 562; Duke Power Co.  v. \nCarolina Environmental Study Group, Inc. , 438 U. S. 59, 74 \n(1978); Simon  v. Eastern Ky. Welfare Rights Organization , \n426 U. S. 26, 41\u201346 (1976); Warth  v. Seldin, 422 U. S. 490, \n504\u2013508 (1975).\nWhen the plaintiff is an unregulated party, causation \n\u201cordinarily hinge[s] on the response of the regulated (or regulable) third party to the government action or \ninaction\u2014and perhaps on the response of others as well.\u201d Lujan, 504 U. S., at 562. Yet the Court has said that \nplaintiffs attempting to show causation generally cannot \n\u201crely on speculation about the unfettered choices made by\nindependent actors not before the courts.\u201d Clapper, 568 \nU. S., at 415, n. 5 (quotation marks omitted); see also \nBennett v. Spear , 520 U. S. 154, 168\u2013169 (1997).  Therefore, \nto thread the causation needle in those circumstances, the \nplaintiff must show that the \u201c \u2018third parties will likely react\nin predictable ways\u2019 \u201d that in turn will likely injure the\nplaintiffs. California , 593 U. S., at 675 (quoting \nDepartment of Commerce  v. New York , 588 U. S. 752, 768 \n(2019)).\nAs this Court has explained, the \u201cline of causation \nbetween the illegal conduct and injury\u201d\u2014the \u201clinks in the chain of causation,\u201d  Allen , 468 U.

See Allen , 468 U. S., at \n757\u2013759; Simon, 426 U. S., at 41\u201346. The causation \nrequirement also rules out attenuated links\u2014that is, where the government action is so far removed from its distant\n(even if predictable) ripple e ffects that the plaintiffs cannot \nestablish Article III standing.  See Allen, 468 U. S., at 757\u2013 \n759; cf. Department of Commerce , 588 U. S., at 768. \nThe causation requirement is central to Article III \nstanding. Like the injury in fact requirement, the causationrequirement screens out plainti ffs who were not injured by\nthe defendant\u2019s action. Without the causation requirement, courts would be \u201cvirtually continuing monitors of the \nwisdom and soundness\u201d of government action.  Allen, 468 \nU. S., at 760 (quotation marks omitted). \nDetermining causation in cases involving suits by\nunregulated parties against the government is admittedly \nnot a \u201cmechanical exercise.\u201d Id., at 751. That is because \nthe causation inquiry can be heavily fact-dependent and a \u201cquestion of degree,\u201d as private petitioner\u2019s counsel aptly\ndescribed it here. Tr. of Oral Arg. 50. Unfortunately,applying the law of standing cannot be made easy, and that \nis particularly true for causation. Just as causation in tort \nlaw can pose line-drawing difficulties, so too can causation \nin standing law when determining whether an unregulated \nparty has standing.\nThat said, the \u201cabsence of precise definitions\u201d has not left \ncourts entirely \u201cat sea in applying the law of standing.\u201d Allen, 468 U. S., at 751.  Like \u201cmost legal notions, the\nstanding concepts have gained considerable definition from\ndeveloping case law.\u201d Ibid.   As the Court has explained, in \n\u201cmany cases the standing question can be answered chiefly \nby comparing the allegations of the particular complaint to\nthose made in prior standing cases.\u201d  Id., at 751\u2013752. \nStated otherwise, assessing standing \u201cin a particular case \n \n   \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n 12 FDA v. ALLIANCE FOR HIPPOCRATIC MEDICINE \nOpinion of the Court \nmay be facilitated by clarifying principles or even clear\nrules developed in prior cases.\u201d Id., at 752. \nConsistent with that understanding of how standing \nprinciples can develop and solidify, the Court has identified a variety of familiar circumstances where government \nregulation of a third-party individual or business may be \nlikely to cause injury in fact to an unregulated plaintiff. For \nexample, when the government regulates (or under-regulates) a business, the regulation (or lack thereof ) may\ncause downstream or upstream economic injuries to others\nin the chain, such as certain manufacturers, retailers, \nsuppliers, competitors, or customers. E.g., National Credit \nUnion Admin.  v. First Nat. Bank & Trust Co. , 522 U. S. 479, \n488, n. 4 (1998); General Motors Corp. v. Tracy , 519 U. S. \n278, 286\u2013287 (1997); Barlow  v. Collins , 397 U. S. 159, 162\u2013 \n164 (1970); Association of Data Processing Service \nOrganizations, Inc.  v. Camp , 397 U. S. 150, 152 (1970).\nWhen the government regulates parks, national forests, or \nbodies of water, for example, the regulation may cause harm to individual users.  E.g., Summers, 555 U. S., at 494. \nWhen the government regulates one property, it mayreduce the value of adjacent property.  The list goes on.  See, \ne.g., Department of Commerce , 588 U. S., at 766\u2013768. \nAs those cases illustrate, to establish causation, the \nplaintiff must show a predictable chain of events leading from the government action to the asserted injury\u2014in other\nwords, that the government action has caused or likely will \ncause injury in fact to the plaintiff.\n2 \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n2In cases of alleged future injuri es to unregulated parties from \ngovernment regulation, the causat ion requirement and the imminence \nelement of the injury in fact requir ement can overlap.  Both target the \ns a m e  i s s u e : I s  i t  l i k e l y  t h a t  t h e government\u2019s regulation or lack of\nregulation of someone else will cause a concrete and particularized injury\nin fact to the unregulated plaintiff? \n   \n \n   \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n 13 Cite as: 602 U. S. ____ (2024) \nOpinion of the Court \nB \nHere, the plaintiff doctors and medical associations are\nunregulated parties who seek to challenge FDA\u2019s regulation \nof others . Specifically, FDA\u2019s regulations apply to doctors\nprescribing mifepristone and  to pregnant women taking\nmifepristone. But the plaintiff doctors and medical \nassociations do not prescribe or use mifepristone.  And FDA \nhas not required the plaintiffs to do anything or to refrain\nfrom doing anything.\nThe plaintiffs do not allege the kinds of injuries described \nabove that unregulated parties sometimes can assert to \ndemonstrate causation. Because the plaintiffs do not\nprescribe, manufacture, sell, or  advertise mifepristone or\nsponsor a competing drug, the plaintiffs suffer no direct \nmonetary injuries from FDA\u2019s actions relaxing regulation of \nmifepristone. Nor do they suffe r injuries to their property, \nor to the value of their property, from FDA\u2019s actions. Because the plaintiffs do not use mifepristone, they obviously can suffer no physical injuries from FDA\u2019s actions \nrelaxing regulation of mifepristone. \nRather, the plaintiffs say that they are pro-life, oppose \nelective abortion, and have sincere legal, moral, ideological, \nand policy objections to mifepristone being prescribed and used by others. The plaintiffs appear to recognize that those \ngeneral legal, moral, ideological, and policy concerns do not suffice on their own to confer Article III standing to sue in \nfederal court. So to try to es tablish standing, the plaintiffs\nadvance several complicated c ausation theories to connect \nFDA\u2019s actions to the plaintiffs\u2019 alleged injuries in fact. \nThe first set of causation theories contends that FDA\u2019s \nrelaxed regulation of mifepristone may cause downstream\nconscience injuries to the in dividual doctor plaintiffs and \nthe specified members of the plaintiff medical associations, \nwho are also doctors. (We will refer to them collectively as \n\u201cthe doctors.\u201d) The second set of causation theories asserts \nthat FDA\u2019s relaxed regulation of mifepristone may cause \n \n   \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n 14 FDA v. ALLIANCE FOR HIPPOCRATIC MEDICINE \nOpinion of the Court \ndownstream economic injuries to the doctors.  The third set \nof causation theories maintains that FDA\u2019s relaxed \nregulation of mifepristone causes injuries to the medical associations themselves, who assert their own \norganizational standing. As we will explain, none of the \ntheories suffices to establish Article III standing. \n1 \nWe first address the plaintiffs\u2019 claim that FDA\u2019s relaxed \nregulation of mifepristone causes conscience injuries to the \ndoctors. \nThe doctors contend that FDA\u2019s 2016 and 2021 actions \nwill cause more pregnant women to suffer complicationsfrom mifepristone, and those women in turn will need more \nemergency abortions by doctors. The plaintiff doctors say\nthat they therefore may be required\u2014against their consciences\u2014to render emergency treatment completing \nconscience injury of that kind  constitutes a concrete injury the abortions or providing other abortion-related \ntreatment. \nThe Government correctly acknowledges  that a \nin fact for purposes of Article III. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 11\u2013\n12; TransUnion , 594 U. S., at 425; see, e.g., Holt v. Hobbs , \n574 U. S. 352 (2015).  So doctors would have standing tochallenge a government action that likely would cause them\nto provide medical treatment against their consciences. \nBut in this case\u2014even assuming for the sake of argument \nthat FDA\u2019s 2016 and 2021 changes to mifepristone\u2019sconditions of use cause more pregnant women to require \nemergency abortions and that some women would likely \nseek treatment from these plaintiff doctors\u2014the plaintiff \ndoctors have not shown that they could be forced toparticipate in an abortion or provide abortion-related\nmedical treatment over their conscience objections.\nThat is because, as the Government explains, federal \nconscience laws definitively  protect doctors from being \n   \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n 15 Cite as: 602 U.

R. 4366, 118th Cong., 2d Sess., Div. C,Title II, \u00a7203 (2024). The Church Amendments, for \ninstance, speak clearly.  They allow doctors and other\nhealthcare personnel to \u201crefus[e] to perform or assist\u201d an\nabortion without punishment or discrimination from their\nemployers.  42 U. S. C. \u00a7300a\u20137(c)(1).  And the Church Amendments more broadly provide that doctors shall not be \nrequired to provide treatment or assistance that would \nviolate the doctors\u2019 religious beliefs or moral convictions. \u00a7300a\u20137(d). Most if not all States have conscience laws to \nthe same effect. See N. Sawi cki, Protections From Civil \nLiability in State Abortion Conscience Laws, 322 JAMA1918 (2019); see, e.g., Tex. Occ. Code Ann. \u00a7103.001 (West \n2022).\nMoreover, as the Government  notes, federal conscience \nprotections encompass \u201cthe doctor\u2019s beliefs rather than \nparticular procedures,\u201d meaning that doctors cannot be \nrequired to treat mifepristone complications in any way \nthat would violate the doctors\u2019 co nsciences.  Tr. of Oral Arg. \n37; see \u00a7300a\u20137(c)(1).  As the Government points out, that strong protection for conscience remains true even in a so-called healthcare desert, where other doctors are not \nreadily available. Tr. of Oral Arg. 18. \nNot only as a matter of law but also as a matter of fact,\nthe federal conscience laws have protected pro-life doctors ever since FDA approved mifepristone in 2000. The \nplaintiffs have not identified any instances where a doctor \nwas required, notwithstanding conscience objections, to \nperform an abortion or to provide other abortion-related treatment that violated the doctor\u2019s conscience. Nor is \nthere any evidence in the record here of hospitals overridingor failing to accommodate docto rs\u2019 conscience objections.\nIn other words, none of th e doctors\u2019 declarations says\nanything like the following:  \u201cHere is the treatment I \n \n   \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n 16 FDA v.

See 42 \nU. S. C. \u00a71395dd.  But the Government has disclaimed that \nreading of EMTALA.  And we agree with the Government\u2019s\nview of EMTALA on that poin t.  EMTALA does not require\ndoctors to perform abortions or provide abortion-related medical treatment over their co nscience objections because \nEMTALA does not impose obligations on individual doctors. \nSee Brief for United States 23, n. 3.  As the Solicitor \nGeneral succinctly and correctl y stated, EMTALA does not \n\u201coverride an individual doctor\u2019s conscience objections.\u201d  Tr. of Oral Arg. 18; see also Tr. of Oral Arg. in Moyle v.

But as the \nGovernment correctly explained, doctors need not follow  a \ntime-intensive procedure to invoke federal conscience\nprotections. Reply Brief for United States 5 . A doctor may \nsimply refuse; federal law protects doctors from \nrepercussions when they have \u201crefu sed\u201d to participate in an \nabortion. \u00a7300a\u20137(c)(1); Reply Brief for United States 5. And as the Government states, \u201c[h]ospitals must \naccommodate doctors in emergency rooms no less than in\nother contexts.\u201d Ibid.

And again, nothing in the record\nsince 2000 supports plaintiffs\u2019 speculation that doctors will \nbe unable to successfully in voke federal conscience \nprotections in emergency circumstances. \nIn short, given the broad and comprehensive conscience\nprotections guaranteed by federal law, the plaintiffs have\nnot shown\u2014and cannot show\u2014that FDA\u2019s actions will \ncause them to suffer any cons cience injury.  Federal law \nfully protects doctors agains t being required to provide \nabortions or other medical treatment against their consciences\u2014and therefore brea ks any chain of causation \nbetween FDA\u2019s relaxed regulati on of mifepristone and any \nasserted conscience injuries to the doctors.\n3 \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n3The doctors also suggest that they are distressed by others\u2019 use of \nmifepristone and by emergency abortions. It is not clear that this alleged\ninjury is distinct from the alleged consci ence injury.  But even if it is, this \nCourt has long made clear that distress at or disagreement with the \nactivities of others is not a basis und er Article III for a plaintiff to bring \na federal lawsuit challenging the le gality of a government regulation \nallowing those activities. See, e.g., Valley Forge Christian College  v. \nAmericans United for Separation of Church and State, Inc. , 454 U. S. \n464, 473, 485\u2013486 (1982); United States v. Richardson,  418 U.

ALLIANCE FOR HIPPOCRATIC MEDICINE \nOpinion of the Court \n2 \nIn addition to alleging conscience injuries, the doctors cite\nvarious monetary and related injuries that they allegedly \nwill suffer as a result of FD A\u2019s actions\u2014in particular,\ndiverting resources and time fr om other patients to treat\npatients with mifepristone co mplications; increasing risk of\nliability suits from treating those patients; and potentially increasing insurance costs.\nThose standing allegations suffer from the same \nproblem\u2014a lack of causation.  The causal link between FDA\u2019s regulatory actions and those alleged injuries is too speculative or otherwise t oo attenuated to establish \nstanding.\nTo begin with, the claim that the doctors will incur those\ninjuries as a result of FDA\u2019s 2016 and 2021 relaxed regulations lacks record support and is highly speculative.The doctors have not offered ev idence tending to suggest\nthat FDA\u2019s deregulatory actions have both caused anincrease in the number of pregnant women seeking \ntreatment from the plaintiff doctors and caused a resulting \ndiversion of the doctors\u2019 time  and resources from other \npatients. Moreover, the doctors have not identified any \ninstances in the past where they have been sued or required to pay higher insurance costs because they have treated \npregnant women suffering mifepr istone complications.  Nor \nhave the plaintiffs offered any persuasive evidence or \nreason to believe that the future will be different. \nIn any event, and perhaps more to the point, the law has \nnever permitted docto rs to challenge the government\u2019s\nloosening of general public safety requirements simply because more individuals might then show up at emergencyrooms or in doctors\u2019 offices with follow-on injuries.  Stated \notherwise, there is no Article III doctrine of \u201cdoctor \nstanding\u201d that allows doctors to challenge general \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n175 (1974); Sierra Club v.

EPA rolls back emissions \nstandards for power plants\u2014does a doctor have standing to\nsue because she may need to spend more time treating \nasthma patients?  A local school district starts a middle \nschool football league\u2014does a pediatrician have standing to\nchallenge its constitutionality because she might need to spend more time treating concussions?  A federal agency \nincreases a speed limit from 65 to 80 miles per hour\u2014does\nan emergency room doctor have standing to sue because hemay have to treat more car accident victims?  The \ngovernment repeals certain restrictions on guns\u2014does a \nsurgeon have standing to sue because he might have to \noperate on more gunshot victims? \nThe answer is no: The chain of causation is simply too \nattenuated. Allowing doctors or  other healthcare providers\nto challenge general safety regulations as unlawfully lax \nwould be an unprecedented and limitless approach and \nwould allow doctors to sue in  federal court to challenge\nalmost any policy affecting public health.\n4 \nAnd in the FDA drug-approval context, virtually all drugs\ncome with complications, risk s, and side effects.  Some \ndrugs increase the risk of heart attack, some may cause cancer, some may cause birth defects, and some heighten\nthe possibility of stroke.  Approval of a new drug may therefore yield more visits to doctors to treat complications\nor side effects.  So the plaintiffs\u2019 loose approach to causation would also essentially allo w any doctor or healthcare\nprovider to challenge any FDA decision approving a new drug. But doctors have neve r had standing to challenge \nFDA\u2019s drug approvals simply on the theory that use of the \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n4A safety law regulating hospitals or the doctors\u2019 medical practices\nobviously would present a different  issue\u2014either such a law would \ndirectly regulate doctors, or the causal link at least would be \nsubstantially less attenuated. \n \n   \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 20 FDA v. ALLIANCE FOR HIPPOCRATIC MEDICINE \nOpinion of the Court \ndrugs by others may cause more visits to doctors. \nAnd if we were now to inve nt a new doctrine of doctor \nstanding, there would be no principled way to cabin such a\nsweeping doctrinal change to doctors or other healthcare \nproviders. Firefighters could sue to object to relaxed\nbuilding codes that increase fire  risks.  Police officers could \nsue to challenge a government decision to legalize certainactivities that are associated with increased crime. Teachers in border states could sue to challenge allegedly\nlax immigration policies that lead to overcrowded \nclassrooms. \nWe decline to start the Federal Judiciary down that \nuncharted path.  That path would seemingly not end untilvirtually every citizen had standing to challenge virtually\nevery government action that they do not like\u2014an approach\nto standing that this Court has consistently rejected as \nflatly inconsistent with Article III.\nWe recognize that many citizens, including the plaintiff\ndoctors here, have sincere concerns about and objections to\nothers using mifepristone and obtaining abortions. But \ncitizens and doctors do not have standing to sue simply because others  are allowed to engage in certain activities\u2014\nat least without the plainti ffs demonstrating how they \nwould be injured by the government\u2019s alleged under-\nregulation of others. See Coalition for Mercury-Free Drugs \nv. Sebelius , 671 F. 3d 1275, 1277 (CADC 2012).  Citizens \nand doctors who object to what the law allows others to do\nmay always take their concerns to the Executive and Legislative Branches and seek greater regulatory or\nlegislative restrictions on certain activities.\nIn sum, the doctors in this case have failed to establish \nArticle III standing. The doctors have not shown that \nFDA\u2019s actions likely will cause them any injury in fact.

Coleman, 455 U. S. 363, \n379, n. 19 (1982).  In doing so, however, organizations must \nsatisfy the usual standards for injury in fact, causation, and \nredressability that apply to individuals.  Id., at 378\u2013379. \nAccording to the medical associations, FDA has \n\u201cimpaired\u201d their \u201cability to provide services and achieve\ntheir organizational missions.\u201d  Brief for Respondents 43.That argument does not work to demonstrate standing.\nLike an individual, an organization may not establish\nstanding simply based on the \u201cintensity of the litigant\u2019s \ninterest\u201d or because of strong opposition to the \ngovernment\u2019s conduct, Valley Forge , 454 U.

A plaintiff must show \u201cfar more than \nsimply a setback to the organization\u2019s abstract social interests.\u201d Havens , 455 U. S., at 379. The plaintiff \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n5The doctors also suggest that th ey can sue in a representative \ncapacity to vindicate their patients\u2019 in juries or potential future injuries, \neven if the doctors have not suffered and would not suffer an injury \nthemselves.  This Court has repeatedly rejected such arguments.  Under this Court\u2019s precedents, third-party standing, as some have called it, \nallows a narrow class of litigants to a ssert the legal rights of others. See \nHollingsworth  v. Perry , 570 U. S. 693, 708 (2013).  But \u201ceven when we \nhave allowed litigants to assert the interests of others, the litigants\nthemselves still must have suffered an injury in fact, thus giving them a\nsufficiently concrete interest in the outcome of the issue in dispute.\u201d  Ibid. \n(quotation marks and alterations om itted).  The third-party standing \ndoctrine does not allow doctors to shoehorn themselves into Article III \nstanding simply by showing that their patients have suffered injuries or\nmay suffer future injuries. \n \n   \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n 22 FDA v. ALLIANCE FOR HIPPOCRATIC MEDICINE \nOpinion of the Court \nassociations therefore cannot assert standing simply\nbecause they object to FDA\u2019s actions. \nThe medical associations say that they have \ndemonstrated something more here.  They claim to have\nstanding not based on their mere disagreement with FDA\u2019s \npolicies, but based on their incurring costs to oppose FDA\u2019s \nactions. They say that FDA has \u201ccaused\u201d the associations \nto conduct their own studies on mifepristone so that the associations can better inform their members and the \npublic about mifepristone\u2019s risks.  Brief for Respondents 43. \nThey contend that FDA has \u201cforced\u201d the associations to \u201cexpend considerable time, energy, and resources\u201d drafting\ncitizen petitions to FDA, as well as engaging in public \nadvocacy and public education.  Id., at 44 (quotation marksomitted). And all of that has caused the associations to \nspend \u201cconsiderable resources\u201d to the detriment of other \nspending priorities. Ibid. \nBut an organization that has not suffered a concrete \ninjury caused by a defendant\u2019s action cannot spend its way into standing simply by expending money to gather\ninformation and advocate against the defendant\u2019s action. \nAn organization cannot manufacture its own standing in\nthat way.\nThe medical associations respond that under Havens \nRealty Corp. v. Coleman , standing exists when an \norganization diverts its resources in response to a \ndefendant\u2019s actions. 455 U. S. 363.  That is incorrect. \nIndeed, that theory would mean that all the organizations \nin America would have standing to challenge almost every \nfederal policy that they dislike,  provided they spend a single \ndollar opposing those policies. Havens does not support\nsuch an expansive theory of standing. \nThe relevant question in Havens was whether a housing\ncounseling organization, HOME, had standing to bring aclaim under the Fair Housing Act against Havens Realty,which owned and operated apartment complexes.

Havens had provided HOME\u2019s black employees \nfalse information about apartment availability\u2014a practice\nknown as racial steering. Id., at 366, and n. 1, 368. \nCritically, HOME not only was an issue-advocacy\norganization, but also operated a housing counseling \nservice. Id., at 368. And when Havens gave HOME\u2019s\nemployees false information about apartment availability,HOME sued Havens because Havens \u201cperceptibly impairedHOME\u2019s ability to provide counseling and referral services\nfor low- and moderate-income homeseekers.\u201d  Id., at 379. In \nother words, Havens\u2019s a ctions directly affected and \ninterfered with HOME\u2019s core business activities\u2014not \ndissimilar to a retailer who sues a manufacturer for selling\ndefective goods to the retailer.\nThat is not the kind of injury that the medical \nassociations have alleged here.  FDA\u2019s actions relaxing regulation of mifepristone have not imposed any similar \nimpediment to the medical associations\u2019 advocacy \nbusinesses. \nAt most, the medical associations suggest that FDA is not \nproperly collecting and disseminating information about mifepristone, which the associations say in turn makes it \nmore difficult for them to in form the public about safety \nrisks. But the associations have not claimed an \ninformational injury, and in any event the associations\nhave not suggested that federal law requires FDA to \ndisseminate such information upon request by members of\nthe public. Cf. Federal Election Comm\u2019n  v. Akins , 524 U. S. \n11 (1998). \nHavens was an unusual case, and this Court has been \ncareful not to extend the Havens  holding beyond its context.\nSo too here. \nFinally, it has been suggested that the plaintiffs here \nmust have standing because if these plaintiffs do not havestanding, then it may be that no one would have standing to challenge FDA\u2019s 2016 and 2021 actions.

S., at 227. Rather, some \nissues may be left to the polit ical and democratic processes:\nThe Framers of the Constitution did not \u201cset up something\nin the nature of an Athenian democracy or a New England \ntown meeting to oversee the conduct of the National \nGovernment by means of lawsuits in federal courts.\u201d \nRichardson , 418 U. S., at 179; see Texas , 599 U. S., at 685. \n* * * \nThe plaintiffs have sincere legal, moral, ideological, and \npolicy objections to elective abortion and to FDA\u2019s relaxed \nregulation of mifepristone. But under Article III of the Constitution, those kinds of objections alone do not establish a justiciable case or controversy in federal court. Here, the plaintiffs have faile d to demonstrate that FDA\u2019s\nrelaxed regulatory requirements likely would cause them to \nsuffer an injury in fact.  For that reason, the federal courts are the wrong forum for addressing the plaintiffs\u2019 concernsabout FDA\u2019s actions.  The plaintiffs may present their concerns and objections to the President and FDA in theregulatory process, or to Congress and the President in thelegislative process.  And they may also express their views about abortion and mifepristo ne to fellow citizens, \nincluding in the political and electoral processes.\n\u201cNo principle is more fundamental to the judiciary\u2019s\nproper role in our system of government than the constitutional limitation of federal-court jurisdiction toactual cases or controversies.\u201d  Simon, 426 U.

Our \nprecedents require a plaintiff to demonstrate that the de -\nfendant\u2019s challenged actions caused his asserted injuries.And, the Court aptly explains why plaintiffs have failed to\nestablish that the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s changes\nto the regulation of mife pristone injured them.  Ante,  at 13\u2013 \n24. \nThe Court also rejects the plaintiff doctors\u2019 theory that \nthey have third-party standing to assert the rights of theirpatients. Ante,  at 21, n. 5. Our third-party standing prec -\nedents allow a plaintiff to assert the rights of another per-\nson when the plaintiff has a \u201cclose relationship with the \nperson who possesses the right\u201d and \u201cthere is a hindrance\nto the possessor\u2019s ability to protect his own interests.\u201d  Kow-\n \n   \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n  \n \n 2 FDA v. ALLIANCE FOR HIPPOCRATIC MEDICINE \nTHOMAS , J., concurring \nalski v. Tesmer , 543 U. S. 125, 130 (2004) (internal quota -\ntion marks omitted). Applying these precedents, the Court \nexplains that the doctors cannot establish third-partystanding to sue for violations of their patients\u2019 rights with-\nout showing an injury of their own.  Ante,  at 21, n. 5.  But, \nthere is a far simpler reason to reject this theory: Our third-party standing doctrine is mistaken.  As I have previously\nexplained, a plaintiff cannot establish an Article III case or controversy by asserting another person\u2019s rights.\n1 See June \nMedical Services L. L. C.  v. Russo, 591 U. S. 299, 366 (2020) \n(THOMAS , J., dissenting); Kowalski , 543 U. S., at 135 \n(THOMAS , J., concurring).  So, just as abortionists lack \nstanding to assert the rights of their clients, doctors who\noppose abortion cannot vicariousl y assert the rights of their \npatients.\nI write separately to highlight what appear to be similar \nproblems with another theory of standing asserted in this\nsuit. The Alliance and other plaintiff associations claim \nthat they have associational standing to sue for their mem-\nbers\u2019 injuries.2 Under the Court\u2019s precedents, \u201can associa-\ntion has standing to bring suit on behalf of its members\nwhen: (a) its members would otherwise have standing to \nsue in their own right; (b) the interests it seeks to protect\nare germane to the organization\u2019s purpose; and (c) neither\nthe claim asserted nor the relief requested requires the par -\nticipation of individual members in the lawsuit.\u201d Hunt  v. \nWashington State Apple Advertising Comm\u2019n , 432 U.

L. C. v. Russo , 591 U. S. 299, 365, n. 2 \n(2020) (T HOMAS , J., dissenting). \n2By \u201cassociational standing,\u201d I do not refer to standing premised upon \nan association\u2019s own alleged injuries.  Instead, I refer to the doctrine that \npermits a plaintiff association to assert the rights of its members.  See Warth v. Seldin , 422 U. S. 490, 511 (1975). \n  \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n  \n  \n  3 Cite as: 602 U. S. ____ (2024) \nTHOMAS , J., concurring \n333, 343 (1977).  If an association can satisfy these require-\nments, we allow the association to pursue its members\u2019 \nclaims, without joining those members as parties to thesuit. \nAssociational standing, however, is simply another form \nof third-party standing.  And, the Court has never ex-\nplained or justified either doctri ne\u2019s expansion of Article III\nstanding. In an appropriate case, we should explain just \nhow the Constitution permits associational standing. \nI \nAssociational standing raises constitutional concerns by \nrelaxing both the injury and redressability requirements\nfor Article III standing. It also upsets other legal doctrines.\nFirst, associational standing conflicts with Article III by \npermitting an association to as sert its members\u2019 injuries in-\nstead of its own. The \u201cjudicial power\u201d conferred by Article\nIII \u201cis limited to cases and controversies of the sort tradi-\ntionally amenable to, and resolved by, the judicial process.\u201d \nSee June Medical , 591 U.

Our doc-\ntrine permits an association to have standing based purely \nupon a member\u2019s injury, not its own.  If a single member of an association has suffered an injury, our doctrine permits\nthat association to seek relie f for its entire membership\u2014\neven if the association has tens of millions of other, non-injured members. See Brief for Professor F. Andrew \nHessick as Amicus Curiae 28 (explaining that, among other \nassociations, the American Association of Retired People\u2019s \n\u201cpotential standing is staggering\u201d because our doctrine per-\nmits it to \u201csue to redress\u201d the injury of a single member out\nof its \u201calmost thirty-eight m illion members\u201d).  As I have al-\nready explained in the context of third-party standing, Ar-\nticle III does not allow a plaint iff to seek to vindicate some-\none else\u2019s injuries.  See June Medical , 591 U. S., at 364\u2013366 \n(opinion of T\nHOMAS , J.); Kowalski , 543 U. S., at 135 (opin-\nion of T HOMAS , J . ) .   I t  i s  d i f f i c u l t  t o  s e e  w h y  t h a t  l o g i c\nshould not apply with equal force  to an association as to any \nother plaintiff. I thus have serious doubts that an associa-tion can have standing to vica riously assert a member\u2019s in -\njury.\nThe Alliance\u2019s attempted use of our associational-stand-\ning doctrine illustrates how far we have strayed from the traditional rule that plainti ffs must assert only their own \ninjuries. The Alliance is an association whose members are other associations. See 1 App. 9\u201310.  None of its members \nare doctors. Instead, the Alliance seeks to have associa-\ntional standing based on injuries to the doctors who are members of its member associations.  Thus, the allegedly \ninjured parties\u2014the doctors \u2014are two degrees removed \nfrom the party before us pursuing those injuries. \nSecond, our associational-st anding doctrine does not ap-\npear to comport with the requi rement that the plaintiff pre-\nsent an injury that the court can redress.  For a plaintiff tohave standing, a court must be able to \u201cprovid[e] a remedy \nthat can redress the plaintiff \u2019s injury.\u201d Uzuegbunam v. \n  \n \n  \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n 5 Cite as: 602 U. S. ____ (2024) \nTHOMAS , J., concurring \nPreczewski, 592 U. S. 279, 291 (2021) (emphasis added).\nBut, as explained, associational standing creates a mis-\nmatch: Although the association is the plaintiff in the suit, it has no injury to redress.  The party who needs the rem-\nedy\u2014the injured member\u2014is not before the court.  Without \nsuch members as parties to the suit, it is questionable \nwhether \u201crelief to these nonparties . . . exceed[s] constitu-\ntional bounds.\u201d  Association of American Physicians & Sur-\ngeons  v. FDA , 13 F. 4th 531, 540 (CA6 2021); see also De-\npartment of Homeland Security  v. New York , 589 U. S. ___, \n___ (2020) (G\nORSUCH , J., concurring in grant of stay) (ex-\nplaining that remedies \u201care meant to redress the injuriessustained by a particular plaintiff in a particular lawsuit\u201d); \nBrief for Professor F. Andrew Hessick as Amicus Curiae  18 \n(\u201cA bedrock principle of the Anglo-American legal systemwas that the right to a remedy for an injury was personal\u201d).\nConsider the remedial problem when an association \nseeks an injunction, as the Alliance did here. See 1 App.113. \u201cWe have long held\u201d that our equity jurisdiction is lim-\nited to \u201cthe jurisdiction in equity exercised by the High\nCourt of Chancery in England at the time of the adoption ofthe Constitution.\u201d Grupo Mexicano de Desarrollo, S. A.  v. \nAlliance Bond Fund, Inc. , 527 U. S. 308, 318 (1999).  And, \n\u201cas a general rule, American courts of equity did not provide \nrelief beyond the parties to the case.\u201d Trump v. Hawaii , 585 \nU. S. 667, 717 (2018) (T\nHOMAS , J., concurring).  For associ -\nations, that principle would mean that the relief could not \nextend beyond the association. But, if a court entered \u201c[a]n\ninjunction that bars a defendant from enforcing a law or regulation against the specific party before the court\u2014the \nassociational plaintiff \u2014[it would] not satisfy Article III be-\ncause it w[ould] not redress an injury.\u201d Association of Amer -\n \n   \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n 6 FDA v. ALLIANCE FOR HIPPOCRATIC MEDICINE \nTHOMAS , J., concurring \nican Physicians & Surgeons , 13 F. 4th, at 540 (internal quo-\ntation marks omitted).3 \nOur precedents have provided a workaround for this ob-\nvious remedial problem through the invention of the so-\ncalled \u201cuniversal injunction.\u201d Universal injunctions typi-\ncally \u201cprohibit the Government from enforcing a policy with \nrespect to anyone.\u201d Trump, 585 U. S., at 713, n. 1 \n(THOMAS , J., concurring).  By providing relief beyond the \nparties to the case, this remedy is \u201clegally and historically dubious.\u201d Id., at 721; see also Labrador  v. Poe, 601 U. S. \n___, ___\u2013___ (2024) (slip op., at 4\u20135) (G\nORSUCH , J., concur-\nring in grant of stay). It seems no coincidence that associa-\ntional standing\u2019s \u201cemergence in the 1960s overlaps with the \nemergence of [this] remedial phenomenon\u201d of a similarly \nquestionable nature. Association of American Physicians & \nSurgeons , 13 F. 4th, at 541.  Because no party should be\npermitted to obtain an injunction in favor of nonparties, Ihave difficulty seeing why an association should be permit-\nted to do so for its members. Associational standing thus \nseems to distort our traditional understanding of the judi-cial power.\nIn addition to these Article III concerns, there is tension \nbetween associational standing and other areas of law.\nFirst, the availability of associational standing subverts the \nclass-action mechanism. A class action allows a named plaintiff to represent others with similar injuries, but it is\nsubject to the many requirements of Federal Rule of Civil\nProcedure 23.  Associational st anding achieves that same \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n3This also raises the question of wh o should pick the remedy.  Associ-\nations \u201cmay have very different in terests from the individuals whose\nrights they are raising.\u201d  Kowalski v. Tesmer , 543 U. S. 125, 135 (2004) \n(THOMAS , J., concurring).  For example, an  association might prefer an \ninjunction preventing the enforcement  of a law that harms its members,\nwhile an injured member may instea d want damages to compensate him\nfor his injuries.  Or perhaps a member  would wish to settle the litigation,\nwhereas an association might want to  continue the fight.  Our associa -\ntional-standing doctrine ignores these obvious concerns. \n  \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n 7 Cite as: 602 U. S. ____ (2024) \nTHOMAS , J., concurring \nend goal: One lawsuit can provide relief to a large group of\npeople. \u201cAs compared to a class action,\u201d however, associa-\ntional standing seems to requi re \u201cshow[ing] an injury to \nonly a single member,\u201d and the association \u201cneed not show \nthat litigation by representation is superior to individual\nlitigation.\u201d 13A C. Wright, A. Miller, & E. Cooper, Federal\nPractice and Procedure \u00a73531.9.5, pp. 879\u2013880 (3d ed.,\nSupp. 2023); see also Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 23(a).  Associa-tional standing thus allows a party to effectively bring a\nclass action without satisfying any of the ordinary require-\nments. Second, associational standing creates the possibil-ity of asymmetrical preclusion.  The basic idea behind pre-\nclusion is that a party gets only one bite at the apple.  If a \nparty litigates and loses an issue or claim, it can be barred\nfrom reasserting that same issue or claim in another suit. \nIn general, preclusion prevents the relitigation of claims orissues only by a party to a previous action, and we have \nbeen careful to limit the exceptions to that rule.  See Taylor \nv. Sturgell , 553 U. S. 880, 892\u2013893 (2008).  In the context of \nassociational standing, the general rule would mean that \npreclusion applies only to the association, even though the\npurpose of the association\u2019s suit is to assert the injuries of \nits members. See id., at 893\u2013896. But, if the association \nloses, it is not clear whethe r the adverse judgment would \nbind the members. See Automobile Workers  v. Brock , 477 \nU. S. 274, 290 (1986) (suggesting that, if an association fails \nto adequately represent its members, \u201ca judgment won against it might not preclude subsequent claims by the as -\nsociation\u2019s members without offending due process princi -\nples\u201d). Associational standing might allow a member twobites at the apple\u2014after an association\u2019s claims are re-\njected, the underlying members might be able to assert the\nexact same issues or claims in a suit in their own names. \nIn short, our associational-s tanding doctrine appears to\ncreate serious problems, both co nstitutional and otherwise. \n \n   \n  \n  \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n 8 FDA v. ALLIANCE FOR HIPPOCRATIC MEDICINE \nTHOMAS , J., concurring \nII \nI am particularly doubtful of associational-standing doc-\ntrine because the Court has neve r attempted to reconcile it \nwith the traditional understanding of the judicial power.\nInstead, the Court departed from that traditional under-\nstanding without explanation, seemingly by accident.  To \ndate, the Court has provided only practical reasons for its \ndoctrine. \nFor over a century and a half, the Court did not have a\nseparate standing doctrine for a ssociations.  As far as I can \ntell, the Court did not expressly contemplate such a doc-trine until the late 1950s.  In NAACP v. Alabama ex rel. \nPatterson , 357 U. S. 449 (1958), the Court permitted an as -\nsociation to assert the constitutional rights of its members\nto prevent the disclosure of its membership lists.  While the \nCourt allowed the NAACP to raise a challenge on behalf of\nits members, it also acknowledged that the NAACP had ar-\nguably faced an injury of its own. Id., at 459\u2013460.  The \nCourt, however, soon discarded any notion that an associa -\ntion needed to have its own injury, creating our modern as-sociational-standing doctrine. In National Motor Freight \nTraffic Assn., Inc. v. United States, 372 U. S. 246 (1963) ( per \ncuriam ), the Court suggested that an uninjured industry \ngroup had standing to challenge a tariff schedule on behalf \nof its members.  Id., at 247.  The Court offered no explana -\ntion for how that theory of standing comported with the tra -\nditional understanding of the judicial power.  In fact, the Court\u2019s entire analysis consisted of a one-paragraph order \ndenying rehearing. Since then, however, the Court has par-\nroted that \u201c [e]ven in the absence of injury to itself , an asso -\nciation may have standing solely as the representative of its members.\u201d Warth  v. Seldin, 422 U. S. 490, 511 (1975) (em-\nphasis added; citing National Motor Freight Traffic Assn. , \n372 U. S. 246); see also, e.g., Automobile Workers , 477 U. S., \nat 281. The Court has gone so far as to hold that a state \n  \n \n  \n  \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 9 Cite as: 602 U. S. ____ (2024) \nTHOMAS , J., concurring \nagency\u2014not a membership organization at all\u2014had associ-\national standing to \u201casser[t] the claims of the Washington\napple growers and dealers who form its constituency.\u201d Hunt , 432 U. S., at 344. \nDespite its continued relianc e on associational standing,\nthe Court has yet to explain ho w the doctrine comports with\nArticle III.  When once asked to \u201creconsider and reject the\nprinciples of associational standing\u201d in favor of the class-action mechanism, the Court justified the doctrine solely by\nreference to its \u201cspecial feat ures, advantageous both to the\nindividuals represented and to the judicial system as a whole.\u201d Automobile Workers , 477 U. S., at 288\u2013289.  Those \n\u201cspecial features\u201d included an association\u2019s \u201cpre-existing \nreservoir of expertise and capital,\u201d and the fact that people \noften join an association \u201cto create an effective vehicle for \nvindicating interests that they share with others.\u201d  Id., at \n289\u2013290. But, considerations of practical judicial policy \ncannot overcome the Constitution \u2019s mandates.  The lack of \nany identifiable justification further suggests that the Court should reconsider its associational-standing doctrine. \n* * * \nNo party challenges our a ssociational-standing doctrine \ntoday. That is understandable; the Court consistently ap-plies the doctrine, discussing only the finer points of its op-\neration. See, e.g., Students for Fair Admissions, Inc.  v. \nPresident and Fellows of Harvard College , 600 U. S. 181, \n199\u2013201 (2023). In this suit, rejecting our associational-\nstanding doctrine is not necessa ry to conclude that the\nplaintiffs lack standing.  In an appropriate case, however,the Court should address whether associational standingcan be squared with Article III\u2019s requirement that courts \nrespect the bounds of their judicial power.",

Chevron Deference Reversal: FDA Rulemaking and Legal Challenges After Loper Bright September 24, 2024 (6 min read) * The views expressed in externally authored materials linked or published on this site do not necessarily reflect the views of LexisNexis Legal & Professional. By:\u00a0Chad A. Landmon and\u00a0Suzanne E. Bassett, POLSINELLI PC THIS ARTICLE PROVIDES GUIDANCE ON THE IMPACT of the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s recent decisions in Loper Bright1 and Corner Post2 on decision-making by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). By Overruling Chevron3 deference to statutory interpretations made by federal agencies, the Supreme Court has likely opened the floodgates for legal challenges to regulations promulgated by the FDA and to final decisions rendered by the FDA. Regulated industries must be mindful of this new legal paradigm when advocating before the agency, in addition to being ready for the court challenges that will undoubtedly be initiated. This article discusses the following topics: Federal court jurisdiction under the Administrative Procedure Act Agency deference Loper Bright and Corner Post Industry best practices Federal Court Jurisdiction under the Administrative Procedure Act Administrative Procedure Act Section 702 of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA)4 grants federal courts jurisdiction to review actions taken by executive branch agencies. Section 706 of the APA5 states that the \u201creviewing court shall decide all relevant questions of law, interpret constitutional and statutory provisions, and determine the meaning or applicability of the terms of an agency action.\u201d Further, Section 706 directs reviewing courts to \u201ccompel agency action unlawfully withheld or unreasonably delayed\u201d6 and to \u201chold unlawful and set aside agency action, findings, and conclusions\u201d that are: Arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law Contrary to constitutional right, power, privilege, or immunity In excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or limitations, or short of statutory right Without observance of procedure required by law Unsupported by substantial evidence in a case concerning formal rulemaking and adjudicatory proceedings or otherwise reviewed on the record of an agency hearing provided by statute Unwarranted by the facts7 Defining a Final Agency Action Judicial review under the APA is limited to final agency actions. For an agency action to be final, and thus subject to judicial review, the action must: Mark the end of the agency\u2019s decision-making process, rather than a tentative or interlocutory action8 Determine rights or obligations, or result in legal consequences9 With respect to actions taken by the FDA, the following are examples of final agency actions: A response to a citizen\u2019s petition10 Interpretation of a statute that causes an Abbreviated New Drug Application applicant to lose its 180-day exclusivity11 Enforcement of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act through administrative procedures12 Issuance of rules and regulations through notice and comment rulemaking13 The following are examples of actions taken by the FDA deemed not to be final agency actions: Issuance of a notice of proposed rulemaking where the notice proposed a ban on an additive but stated that it would take no action14 Statements made in a preamble to final regulations15 Threats made during an in-person meeting to seize mislabeled products16 Agency Deference Section 706 of the APA17 authorizes a court to \u201chold unlawful and set aside agency action\u201d that it finds \u201carbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with the law.\u201d As a result, the APA makes judges the decision-makers of all questions of law properly before them and contemplates some level of deference if the agency\u2019s interpretation of the statute is reasonable (i.e., not arbitrary, capricious, or an abuse of discretion). To effectively carry out their statutory responsibilities, courts have created doctrinal tests to determine whether to give an agency\u2019s interpretation of a statute or regulation any deference.

FDA May Slow Down Rulemaking and Use Other Tools at its Disposal With more tools for companies to challenge FDA rulemaking, it is possible that FDA-regulated companies will see a slowdown in FDA rulemaking as the agency must now consider whether there is another permissible statutory interpretation. With less incentive to rely on the rulemaking process, the FDA may also rely more heavily on guidance documents, which do not carry the force of law, or individual enforcement actions against specific companies or products. As time progresses, it will be increasingly important to monitor the FDA landscape and any changes the agency takes to its regulatory approach. Chad A. Landmon chairs Polsinelli\u2019s Hatch-Waxman & Biologics Practice and is a first chair trial lawyer known for his adept handling of both patent litigation and the FDA approval processes, ensuring clients can efficiently and profitably bring their products to market. He is recognized globally as a leading patent litigator by IAM Patent 1000, Benchmark Litigation, and Law360, and has successfully litigated more than 60 cases in the past decade alone. Suzanne E. Bassett, an associate at Polsinelli, counsels clients on compliance, enforcement, and transactional matters subject to overlapping jurisdictions of the FDA, U.S. Department of Agriculture, the Federal Trade Commission, and the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission. Suzanne\u2019s experience also extends to matters involving the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, and various state and municipal agencies.

          "task_beliefs": "My understanding of this case is centered on a fundamental clash between two powerful legal narratives. The government, through the Solicitor General (SG), has framed this as a case about procedural integrity, arguing that R.J. Reynolds (RJR) engaged in \"blatant forum shopping\" by using retailers to anchor the case in the favorable Fifth Circuit. The SG's core argument is structural: allowing this would nullify the Tobacco Control Act's (TCA) specific venue provision, as a manufacturer could always find a retailer in any circuit it chooses. This narrative appeals to the Court's role in policing the judicial process.\n\nIn response, RJR's Brief in Opposition (BIO) skillfully reframed the issue, decoupling the SG's linked arguments. RJR presents two separate, technical questions: 1) Are retailers, who are prohibited from selling a key product, \"adversely affected\" under the plain text of the statute? and 2) Does the \"pendent venue\" doctrine allow a proper petitioner (RJR) to join a suit once venue is properly established by another petitioner (the retailer)? This counter-narrative, supported by the presence of former SG Noel Francisco, leans on textualism and established principles of civil procedure, arguing the government is inventing a special, stricter venue rule for this case. RJR also highlighted potential \"vehicle problems\" (interlocutory review, no circuit split) as reasons for the Court to deny review. This left my prediction in a state of high uncertainty, dependent on which frame the Court would adopt.\n\nThe latest observation\u2014that the Solicitor General has chosen *not* to file a reply brief\u2014is a subtle but significant signal. By forgoing the opportunity to rebut RJR's \"pendent venue\" and \"plain text\" arguments, the SG is signaling a high degree of confidence in their original petition. This action implies a belief that the \"forum shopping\" and structural nullification arguments are so compelling on their own that they will persuade the Court to grant certiorari without further briefing. The government is essentially standing pat, betting that the Justices will see the big-picture threat to the statutory scheme and view RJR's procedural arguments as a distraction. While this does not resolve the substantive legal clash, it does slightly increase my assessment of the likelihood that the government's narrative will prevail, at least at the certiorari stage. The government's posture is one of strength, implicitly dismissing the BIO's counter-arguments as insufficient to deter the Court from taking up the case.",
          "design_beliefs": "My methodology continues to be refined with each observation, moving towards a more sophisticated model of Supreme Court prediction.\n\n1.  **Confirmed Value of the \"Cert Petition -> BIO\" Loop:** This remains the foundational strategy for cert-stage analysis. The petition and opposition define the primary arguments and competing frames of the case.\n\n2.  **Refining the \"Solicitor General Signal\":** The SG's framing is a powerful predictive tool, but its true value is revealed in how it interacts with the opposition. The SG's initial narrative (\"forum shopping\") was effectively countered by RJR's BIO (\"pendent venue\"). The SG's decision not to file a reply adds another layer to this signal, suggesting confidence in the original frame's durability.\n\n3.  **New Heuristic - The \"Non-Reply Signal\":** The absence of a document can be as informative as its presence. A petitioner, especially a sophisticated one like the Solicitor General, forgoing their option to file a reply to the BIO is a strategic choice. It should be interpreted as a signal of confidence in their initial petition's strength and a belief that the respondent's arguments do not pose a significant threat to a grant of certiorari. This is a new, valuable heuristic for gauging a party's strategic assessment of the case.\n\n4.  **Updated Research Workflow:** My core research loop for cert-stage cases is now more complete: **Cert Petition -> BIO -> Reply Brief Check**. The third step is crucial. If a reply exists, it shows which of the BIO's arguments the petitioner felt were most threatening. If it *doesn't* exist, as in this case, it signals the petitioner's confidence.\n\n5.  **New Heuristic - The \"Decoupling\" Strategy:** I continue to find this a powerful analytical lens. The SG linked standing and venue to create a \"forum shopping\" narrative. RJR's counter was to sever that link, analyzing them as separate issues. This tactic of linking or decoupling related statutory provisions is a key legal reasoning pattern to watch for.\n\n6.  **New Heuristic - The \"Procedural Off-Ramp\" Check:** The BIO's arguments about the case being a \"poor vehicle\" remain a critical part of my analysis. Before predicting the merits, I must always assess if the Court has a procedural basis to simply avoid the question. The SG's non-reply suggests they are not worried about these off-ramps, but they remain a factor in the Court's decision-making.\n\n7.  **Source Evaluation - Elite Counsel Signal:** The involvement of top-tier advocates like a former SG on the respondent's side remains a strong indicator of a high-quality, strategic opposition. This heuristic correctly predicted that the BIO would be a formidable document.\n\n8.  **Source Evaluation - Negative Search Results:** This observation confirms that a search returning zero results is not a failure but a meaningful data point. The docket is the ground truth, and the absence of an expected filing reflects a deliberate, strategic choice by a litigant that must be incorporated into the analysis."

          "task_beliefs": "My understanding of this case has been fundamentally reshaped by the discovery of a recent, unanimous Supreme Court decision that speaks directly to the core legal issue.\n\nMy initial belief centered on a clash of narratives. The Solicitor General (SG) framed the case as one of \"blatant forum shopping,\" arguing that allowing R.J. Reynolds (RJR) to use retailers to anchor its lawsuit in the favorable Fifth Circuit would structurally nullify the Tobacco Control Act's (TCA) specific venue provision. RJR, represented by former SG Noel Francisco, skillfully countered by decoupling the issues, presenting a technical argument based on the \"plain text\" of the statute (are retailers \"adversely affected\"?) and the \"pendent venue\" doctrine. The SG's subsequent decision not to file a reply brief signaled strong confidence in their initial petition, slightly tilting my prediction toward the government, but I remained in a state of high uncertainty about which frame the Court would adopt.\n\nThe latest observation\u2014the unanimous Supreme Court opinion in *FDA v. Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine* (AHM)\u2014is a dispositive piece of evidence that dramatically clarifies the likely outcome. In AHM, decided just this term, the Court held 9-0 that pro-life doctors and associations lacked Article III standing to challenge the FDA's decision to loosen regulations on the drug mifepristone. The Court reasoned that the doctors were \"unregulated parties\" seeking to challenge the regulation of others, and their alleged downstream injuries (conscience violations, economic costs from treating complications) were too \"speculative\" and \"attenuated\" to establish a cognizable injury. Justice Kavanaugh, writing for the Court, explicitly rejected the argument that standing must exist simply so that *someone* can challenge a government action, stating some issues are left to the political process.\n\nThis precedent is devastating to RJR's position and provides a powerful, ready-made legal basis for the government's argument. The retailers in this case are in a nearly identical position to the doctors in AHM: they are \"unregulated parties\" claiming a downstream economic injury (lost sales) resulting from an FDA action directed at a third party (the manufacturer, RJR). The AHM decision strongly suggests that such an injury is insufficient to confer Article III standing.\n\nTherefore, the central legal question is no longer a niche statutory interpretation of \"adversely affected\" under the TCA, but a fundamental constitutional question of Article III standing. If the retailers lack standing, they cannot be proper petitioners, and the entire basis for venue in the Fifth Circuit collapses. This transforms the SG's \"forum shopping\" narrative from a persuasive policy argument into a conclusion rooted in fresh, unanimous constitutional precedent. The Court now has a clear, clean, and cross-ideologically supported \"off-ramp\" to reverse the Fifth Circuit without needing to delve into the complexities of pendent venue or the TCA's specific language. My prediction has shifted from uncertain to a high-confidence belief that the Supreme Court will reverse the Fifth Circuit's decision, likely on the grounds that the retailers lack standing.",
          "design_beliefs": "My methodology for legal prediction has undergone a significant evolution, incorporating new, high-value strategies and refining existing ones.\n\n1.  **Confirmed Value of the \"Cert Petition -> BIO\" Loop:** This remains the foundational strategy for understanding the competing narratives and legal frames of a case at the cert stage.\n\n2.  **Refining the \"Solicitor General Signal\":** The SG's framing is a key signal. The SG's choice *not* to file a reply brief, which I initially interpreted as simple confidence, now appears in hindsight to have been based on the knowledge that a dispositive, favorable precedent (AHM) was already in the Court's pipeline, making a reply redundant.\n\n3.  **New Heuristic - The \"Non-Reply Signal\":** The absence of a reply brief signals confidence. This can be confidence in the original arguments, or, as learned here, it could be confidence based on external factors, such as pending decisions that will resolve the issue.\n\n4.  **Updated Research Workflow:** My workflow has become more robust. The core loop is now: **1. Cert Petition -> BIO -> Reply Brief Check.** **2. Identify Core Legal Concepts.** **3. Conduct Targeted Search for *Recent* (Current Term) SCOTUS/Circuit Precedent on those concepts.** This third step is paramount, as it can unearth game-changing information.\n\n5.  **New Heuristic - The \"Decoupling\" and \"Recoupling\" Strategy:** I observed RJR's strategy of decoupling venue from the forum-shopping charge. The AHM precedent, however, reveals a deeper constitutional link: standing is a prerequisite for being a petitioner, which is a prerequisite for establishing venue. An effective counter-strategy is to \"recouple\" a procedural argument to its constitutional foundation (in this case, recoupling venue to standing).\n\n6.  **New Heuristic - The \"Procedural Off-Ramp\" Check:** I continue to assess whether the Court has a procedural basis to avoid a merits question. The AHM decision provides exactly this: a standing-based off-ramp that is even cleaner and more fundamental than the \"vehicle problem\" arguments RJR raised.\n\n7.  **Source Evaluation - Elite Counsel Signal:** The presence of elite counsel remains a signal of a well-argued case. However, this observation proves that even the most skillful arguments (like Francisco's for RJR) can be rendered moot by a new, directly adverse precedent.\n\n8.  **Source Evaluation - Negative Search Results:** A search returning no results (like for the reply brief) is a meaningful data point reflecting a strategic choice.\n\n9.  **New Heuristic - \"Recency & Relevance Primacy\":** A recent, unanimous Supreme Court opinion on a closely related legal issue is the highest-value signal available. Its predictive power is immense and can override nearly all other factors, including briefing tactics and counsel reputation. Identifying such precedents is a top priority.\n\n10. **New Heuristic - \"The Unanimity Signal\":** A 9-0 decision on a procedural doctrine like standing indicates a strong, stable, cross-ideological consensus. This suggests the holding is a durable principle the Court will apply consistently, not an ideological one-off.\n\n11. **New Heuristic - The Power of \"Term of Art\" Searches:** My successful search was not for the case name but for the underlying legal concept (`\"person adversely affected\"`). This confirms that identifying and searching for the key legal \"terms of art\" is a highly effective strategy for discovering relevant precedent.\n\n12. **Source Hierarchy:** This process reinforces the critical hierarchy of legal sources. A primary source like a SCOTUS opinion (*AHM*) is definitive. A high-level academic critique (*Yale Journal on Regulation* article) provides valuable context for interpreting the Court's behavior but is not the law itself. A law firm blog post (*Loper Bright* analysis) is useful for spotting trends but is the least authoritative. My analysis must prioritize and weigh sources accordingly."

This belief is the culmination of an analytical journey that began with uncertainty and ended with the discovery of a dispositive legal precedent.\n\nInitially, I perceived the case as a finely balanced contest between two compelling narratives. The Solicitor General (SG) argued that R.J. Reynolds (RJR) engaged in \"blatant forum shopping\" by using retailers to anchor its case in the favorable Fifth Circuit, a move that threatened to undermine the Tobacco Control Act's (TCA) specific judicial review provisions. Conversely, RJR's counsel, Noel Francisco, adeptly framed the issue as a technical question of statutory interpretation (\"are retailers 'adversely affected'?\") combined with the \"pendent venue\" doctrine. The SG's decision not to file a reply brief was a key signal, which I first interpreted as general confidence but now understand was likely rooted in the knowledge that a more powerful argument was forthcoming from the Court itself.\n\nThe turning point was my discovery of the Supreme Court's unanimous, current-term decision in *FDA v. Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine* (AHM). This precedent is not merely relevant; it is functionally dispositive. In AHM, the Court held 9-0 that doctors, as \"unregulated parties,\" lacked Article III standing to challenge FDA regulations concerning a third party, as their alleged downstream injuries were too speculative and attenuated. This ruling provides a direct and powerful analogy for the present case. The retailers are, like the AHM doctors, unregulated parties claiming a downstream economic injury (lost sales) from an FDA action directed at a manufacturer (RJR).\n\nThe AHM precedent fundamentally reframes the legal question from one of statutory interpretation under the TCA to one of constitutional standing under Article III. If the retailers lack standing, they cannot be proper petitioners, and the entire basis for venue in the Fifth Circuit collapses. This provides the Court with a clean, non-ideological, and unanimously supported \"procedural off-ramp\" to reverse the Fifth Circuit without needing to engage with the more complex statutory or pendent venue arguments. The SG's \"forum shopping\" argument is thus transformed from a policy concern into the practical consequence of a constitutional defect.\n\nThe final internal reasoning step confirms this analysis. My uncertainty is now resolved. The discovery of AHM was the terminal point of my inquiry, as it provided an answer with such high predictive power that further investigation would yield diminishing returns. My final belief is that the Court will find the retailers lack Article III standing, citing AHM, and will therefore reverse the Fifth Circuit's decision on that threshold ground.",
          "design_beliefs": "My methodology for legal prediction has been tested and significantly enhanced through this process, culminating in a more robust and efficient workflow.\n\n1.  **Confirmed Value of the \"Cert Petition -> BIO\" Loop:** This remains the essential first step for mapping the core legal arguments and narrative frames of a case.\n\n2.  **Refining the \"Solicitor General Signal\":** The SG's strategic choices are a potent signal. The absence of a reply brief, initially seen as simple confidence, is now understood to be a more complex signal. It can indicate confidence in existing arguments *or* awareness of external, case-dispositive events, such as a pending, favorable Supreme Court decision.\n\n3.  **New Heuristic - The \"Non-Reply Signal\":** The absence of a reply brief is a data point signifying high confidence. The source of that confidence (intrinsic merits vs. extrinsic factors like a pending case) becomes a key question for further investigation.\n\n4.  **Updated Research Workflow:** My core workflow has been validated and refined: **1. Cert Petition -> BIO -> Reply Brief Check.** **2. Identify Core Legal Concepts & \"Terms of Art\".** **3. Conduct Targeted Search for *Recent* (Current Term) SCOTUS/Circuit Precedent on those concepts.** This third step proved to be the most critical, as it unearthed the dispositive AHM precedent.\n\n5.  **New Heuristic - The \"Decoupling\" and \"Recoupling\" Strategy:** I have learned to recognize the strategy of \"decoupling\" a procedural issue from its broader context (as RJR did with venue and forum shopping). An effective counter-analysis involves \"recoupling\" that issue to a more fundamental principle, in this case, recoupling venue to the constitutional prerequisite of Article III standing.\n\n6.  **New Heuristic - The \"Procedural Off-Ramp\" Check:** The search for a procedural basis for the Court to resolve a case without reaching the merits remains a high-priority heuristic. The AHM precedent provided a perfect example: a standing-based off-ramp that is cleaner and more fundamental than statutory arguments.\n\n7.  **Source Evaluation - Elite Counsel Signal:** While the presence of elite counsel (Noel Francisco) signals a high-quality argument, this case proves that even the most skilled advocacy can be nullified by a directly adverse, recent, and unanimous Supreme Court precedent. Precedent outweighs pedigree.\n\n8.  **Source Evaluation - Negative Search Results:** A null result, such as the absence of a reply brief, is not an absence of information but a meaningful signal of a strategic choice that requires interpretation.\n\n9.  **New Heuristic - \"Recency & Relevance Primacy\":** A recent, unanimous Supreme Court opinion on a core legal issue is the single most valuable and predictive signal. Its discovery should be a primary goal of the research process, as it can override almost all other signals.\n\n10. **New Heuristic - \"The Unanimity Signal\":** A 9-0 decision, especially on a procedural doctrine like standing, signals a stable, cross-ideological consensus. This makes the precedent a highly reliable predictor of the Court's future behavior on that issue.\n\n11. **New Heuristic - The Power of \"Term of Art\" Searches:** The success of my search for `\"person adversely affected\"` confirms that identifying and using the precise legal \"terms of art\" is a superior strategy for finding relevant precedent compared to searching for case names or general concepts.\n\n12. **Source Hierarchy:** This exercise reinforces the primacy of sources. A SCOTUS opinion is dispositive law. High-level academic analysis offers interpretive context. Law firm blogs spot trends. Analysis must be weighted according to this hierarchy.\n\n13. **New Heuristic - The \"Dispositive Evidence Stop-Rule\":** An essential new meta-heuristic is knowing when to conclude the information-gathering process. When evidence is discovered that is (a) from the highest authority (SCOTUS), (b) recent (current term), (c) unanimous, and (d) directly on-point with the core legal question, it can be considered dispositive for predictive purposes. At this point, further searching on that question offers sharply diminishing returns, and the analytical focus should shift to finalizing the prediction. This prevents inefficient, endless searching and enables decisive judgment."
