    "case_title": "Free Speech Coalition, Inc., et al., Petitioners v. Ken Paxton, Attorney General of Texas",
    "resolution_date": "Jun 27 2025",
    "legal_questions": [
      "Is a Texas law that requires any website that publishes content one-third or more of which is 'harmful to minors' to verify the age of each of its users before providing access subject to 'rational basis' review or 'strict scrutiny'?"
    ],
    "legal_answers": [
      "No"
    ],
    "facts_of_the_case": "Texas enacted H.B. 1181, a law regulating commercial entities that publish or distribute material on internet websites, including social media platforms, where more than one-third of the content is sexual material harmful to minors. The law requires these entities to implement age verification methods to limit access to adults and display specific health warnings on their landing pages and advertisements. It defines sexual material harmful to minors using a modified version of the Miller test for obscenity.\n\nShortly after the law was enacted but before it took effect, plaintiffs sued, claiming H.B. 1181 violates their First Amendment rights and, for some plaintiffs, conflicts with Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. The district court issued a pre-enforcement preliminary injunction, finding that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed on the merits of their claim and suffer irreparable harm. The court ruled that the age-verification requirement and health warnings fail strict scrutiny\u2014that is, that it is not narrowly tailored to achieve a compelling government interest using the least restrictive means to achieve that interest\u2014and that Section 230 preempts H.B. 1181 for certain plaintiffs. On appeal, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit concluded that rational basis review\u2014i.e., rationally related to a legitimate government interest\u2014was the proper standard of review and thus vacated the injunction against the age-verification requirement but affirmed as to the health warnings.",

I have high uncertainty about the specific legal arguments, precedents, and constitutional theories the petitioners will use to advocate for strict scrutiny. This action directly retrieves the primary source document that will explicitly detail their entire case. Reading the petitioner's brief will massively reduce my uncertainty by providing the precise framework of their argument, which is essential for predicting the Court's reaction. It is the most direct path to understanding one half of the legal battle.\n\nDesign EIG (0.7): My current design belief is that reading the petitioner's brief is a powerful initial heuristic. Executing this action serves to validate and refine this strategy. By analyzing the retrieved document, I can learn about the typical structure of such briefs, identify the most persuasive sections (e.g., Summary of Argument), and confirm the efficiency of this step. This provides concrete evidence to strengthen a general strategic principle, moving it from a hypothesis to a tested method, which is a significant gain for my overall design effectiveness.\n\nJoint EIG (1.6): The action is exceptionally efficient because the information gained serves both the immediate task and long-term strategy. It provides the core data needed to begin a substantive analysis of the case (high Task EIG) while simultaneously providing a real-world test case for a key strategic heuristic (high Design EIG).",

The design beliefs demonstrate sophisticated meta-level strategic thinking, including heuristic development and prioritization of information sources, indicating adaptive and reflective strategy formation but not yet at the highest meta-cognitive complexity. The beliefs are highly coherent, with task and design beliefs well integrated and mutually reinforcing. Information density is substantial, providing rich contextual and procedural detail without exhaustive coverage of all legal nuances.

Literature 236 (1973) ......................... 18\n\n \n \nINTRODUCTION \nAmericans hold a wide range of views about sexual \ncontent online.  Some view it as offensive or indecent; \nfor others, it is artistic, informative, or even essential to \nimportant parts of career and life.  Consistent with the \nbedrock First Amendment principle that \u201cesthetic and \nmoral judgments about art and literature \u2026 are for the \nindividual to make, not for the Government to decree,\u201d \nthis Court has long treated non-obscene sexual content \nas constitutionally protected for adults.  United States \nv. Playboy Ent. Grp., Inc., 529 U.S. 803, 818 (2000).  And \nwhile the Court has held that states may limit minors\u2019 \naccess to sexual material reasonably found harmful to \nthem, Ginsberg v. New York, 390 U.S. 629, 638-39 (1968), \nthe Court has uniformly held that a content-based \nburden on adults\u2019 access to such protected speech \u201ccan \nstand only if it satisfies strict scrutiny,\u201d Playboy, 529 \nU.S. at 813; see Ashcroft v. ACLU, 542 U.S. 656, 665-66 \n(2004); Reno v. ACLU, 521 U.S. 844, 874 (1997); Sable \nCommc\u2019ns v. FCC, 492 U.S. 115, 126 (1989). \nEnacted in 2023, Texas House Bill (H.B.) 1181 \nimposes requirements on commercial websites \u201cmore \nthan one-third of which\u201d are \u201csexual material harmful \nto minors\u201d\u2014a term that includes all sexually suggestive \ncontent, as might be found in romance novels or R-rated \nmovies.  Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code \u00a7 129B.002(a).  The \nlaw requires a covered website to verify the age of every \nuser, typically via government-issued identification.  Id.  \n\u00a7\u00a7 129B.002-003.  Entities conducting such verification \nmay not \u201cretain\u201d users\u2019 \u201cidentifying information,\u201d id. \n\u00a7 129B.002(b), but H.B. 1181 does not prohibit transfer \nof that information or impose any other protection \nagainst disclosure.  And while Texas insists that forcing \nusers to endure chilling online privacy and security \n\n2 \n \n \nrisks is necessary to protect minors from harmful \nsexual content, H.B. 1181 exempts the search engines \nand social-media platforms that are principal gateways \nfor minors\u2019 access to that very content.  Id. \u00a7 129B.005. \nConfirming Texas\u2019s real aims, H.B. 1181 also requires \ncovered websites to post stigmatizing, unscientific \n\u201c[w]arnings\u201d that condemn their content as harmful to \nhealth.  Id. \u00a7 129B.004. \nThe district court preliminarily enjoined H.B. 1181, \nfinding that the law is subject to strict scrutiny and \nlikely to fail it under this Court\u2019s governing precedent.  \nIn particular, the court explained that H.B. 1181\u2019s age-\nverification requirement is materially identical to the \nChild Online Protection Act (COPA), 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 231, \nwhich this Court in Ashcroft held was subject to strict \nscrutiny and likely unconstitutional.  The Fifth Circuit \nagreed that H.B. 1181 is materially identical to COPA, \nbut a divided panel held that it was not bound by \nAshcroft because that decision contains what the \nmajority termed \u201cstartling omissions.\u201d  Pet. App. \n17a.  The majority concluded that the proper level of \nscrutiny is instead rational-basis review, as applied in \nGinsberg.  To justify its departure from Ashcroft, the \nmajority reasoned that this Court there applied strict \nscrutiny to COPA only because Attorney General \nAshcroft, represented by Solicitor General Olson, \nerroneously accepted strict scrutiny rather than urging \nmere rational-basis review in defense of the statute.   \nAs recognized by Judge Higginbotham\u2019s dissent, the \nFifth Circuit veered astray.  This Court in Ashcroft did \nnot apply strict scrutiny to COPA based on an oversight \nor concession.  It did so because First Amendment \nprinciples and precedent firmly establish that strict \nscrutiny \napplies \nto \ncontent-based \nburdens \non \n\n3 \n \n \nconstitutionally protected speech, specifically including \nsexual content that is not obscene for adults.  Neither \nTexas\u2019s professed aim to protect minors nor Ginsberg\u2019s \nholding\u2014which applies only to the rights of minors\u2014\nalters that analysis.  The laws in Ashcroft, Reno, \nPlayboy, and Sable all aimed to protect minors, and this \nCourt applied strict scrutiny in each of those post-\nGinsberg decisions.  Strict scrutiny applies here too. \nUnder strict scrutiny, this is a straightforward \ncase.  As the district court found and the Fifth Circuit \ndid not question, H.B. 1181 is both overinclusive and \nunderinclusive, and it fails to pursue its objective with \nthe means least restrictive of adults\u2019 protected speech.  \nIndeed, Texas has disregarded the measure specifically \nidentified in Ashcroft as both less restrictive and more \neffective than online age-verification: content-filtering \nsoftware, which limits minors\u2019 access to sexual material \ninappropriate for them without burdening adults\u2019 \naccess to speech they have a right to receive.  That \nlegislative oversight is especially striking because \ncontent-filtering \ntechnology \nhas \nimproved \nsince \nAshcroft.  Meanwhile, online age-verification has grown \neasier to circumvent and threats of online identity theft, \nextortion, and data breaches have multiplied\u2014\nheightening chills in the highly sensitive and personal \ncontext of accessing sexual material. \nRestoring the preliminary injunction of H.B. 1181 by \nreversing the erroneous decision below would not \nundermine genuine efforts to limit minors\u2019 access to \nsexually inappropriate material.  Petitioners agree that \nprotecting minors is a compelling government interest \nand that\u2014as this Court expressly stated in Ashcroft\u2014a \nlaw narrowly tailored to that objective can survive strict \nscrutiny.  542 U.S. at 672-73.  The Fifth Circuit\u2019s \n\n4 \n \n \napplication of rational-basis review is therefore as \nunnecessary as it is wrong.  As in other recent cases, the \nCourt should adhere to \u201csettled principles about \nfreedom of expression\u201d that have \u201cserved the Nation \nwell over many years\u201d and reject the Fifth Circuit\u2019s \njarring departure from First Amendment precedent.  \nMoody v. NetChoice, LLC, 144 S. Ct. 2383, 2403 (2024).   \nOPINIONS BELOW \nThe Fifth Circuit\u2019s opinion (Pet. App. 1a-87a) is \nreported at 95 F.4th 263.  The opinion of the district \ncourt granting a preliminary injunction (Pet. App. 90a-\n161a) is reported at 689 F. Supp. 3d 373. \nJURISDICTION \nThe Fifth Circuit entered its judgment on March 7, \n2024.  Petitioners timely petitioned for certiorari on \nApril 12, 2024.  This Court has jurisdiction under 28 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 1254(1). \nCONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY \nPROVISIONS INVOLVED \nThe First Amendment to the United States \nConstitution provides in relevant part that \u201cCongress \nshall make no law \u2026 abridging the freedom of speech.\u201d  \nH.B. 1181 is reproduced in an appendix to this brief. \nSTATEMENT \nA. Legal And Factual Background \n1.  \u201cThe most basic\u201d principle of free speech is that \n\u201cgovernment has no power to restrict expression \nbecause of its message, its ideas, its subject matter, or \nits content.\u201d  Brown v. Ent. Merchs. Ass\u2019n, 564 U.S. 786, \n790-91 (2011) (citation omitted).  Generally, when a law \n\u201cimposes a restriction on the content of protected \n\n5 \n \n \nspeech, it is invalid unless \u2026 it passes strict scrutiny\u2014\nthat is, unless it is justified by a compelling government \ninterest and is narrowly drawn to serve that interest.\u201d  \nId. at 799.  Otherwise, content-based speech restrictions \nare permitted only in limited \u201chistoric and traditional \ncategories long familiar to the bar.\u201d  United States v. \nStevens, 559 U.S. 460, 468 (2010) (citation omitted).   \nOne such category is obscenity, defined as material \nthat \n\u201cdepicts \nor \ndescribes \n\u2026 \nsexual \ncontent\u201d \n(specifically identified by statute), in a \u201cpatently \noffensive\u201d way that \u201cappeals to the prurient interest,\u201d \nand, taken as a whole, \u201clacks serious literary, artistic, \npolitical, or scientific value.\u201d  Miller v. California, 413 \nU.S. 15, 24 (1973) (citation omitted).  In Ginsberg, the \nCourt upheld a state law that \u201cadjusts the definition of \nobscenity\u201d applicable to minors based on their different \nreaction to sexual content.  Id. at 638 (citation omitted).  \nAs to adults, however, the Court has \u201cmade it perfectly \nclear that \u2018sexual expression which is \u2026 not obscene is \nprotected by the First Amendment.\u2019\u201d  Reno, 521 U.S. at \n874 (brackets and citation omitted).  And the Court has \nrepeatedly held that laws imposing content-based \nburdens on adults\u2019 access to such constitutionally \nprotected expression are subject to strict scrutiny, even \nif the laws permissibly aim to restrict minors\u2019 access to \nsuch material.  Id.; see Ashcroft, 542 U.S. at 665-66; \nPlayboy, 529 U.S. at 813; Sable, 492 U.S. at 126. \nThe Court\u2019s most recent decision in that line of cases \nis Ashcroft.  There, the Court considered a challenge to \nCOPA, \nwhich \nprohibited\u2014absent \nage-verification \nmeasures\u2014the online transmission of content that \nCongress deemed obscene for minors using a modified \nobscenity standard like the one at issue in Ginsberg.  \n542 U.S. at 661-62.  Because COPA burdened adults\u2019 \n\n6 \n \n \naccess to speech constitutionally protected for them, the \nCourt held that strict scrutiny applied for the same \nreasons as in analogous prior cases.  Id. at 665-66 (citing \nReno, 521 U.S. at 874); see id. at 670 (citing Playboy, \n529 U.S. at 825-26).  The Court then upheld a \npreliminary injunction of COPA, determining that the \nstatute was likely unconstitutional because \u201cless \nrestrictive \nalternatives\u201d\u2014in \nparticular, \ncontent-\nfiltering software\u2014\u201cwould be at least as effective in \nachieving the legitimate purpose that the statute was \nenacted to serve.\u201d  Id. at 665 (quoting Reno, 521 U.S. at \n874); see id. at 665-66, 673. \n2.  Almost 20 years after Ashcroft, in June 2023, \nTexas enacted H.B. 1181.  H.B. 1181 requires age \nverification by any commercial website \u201cmore than one-\nthird of which is sexual material harmful to minors,\u201d \nTex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code \u00a7 129B.002(a), defined \nusing almost exactly the same modification of the adult \nobscenity standard that Congress adopted in COPA, id. \n\u00a7 129B.001(6).1  Because this statutory definition \napplies to even the youngest minors, for whom almost \n \n1  \nSpecifically, H.B. 1181 defines \u201c[s]exual material harmful \nto minors\u201d as including material that \u201c(A) the average person \napplying contemporary community standards would find, taking \nthe material as a whole and with respect to minors, is designed to \nappeal to or pander to the prurient interest; (B) in a manner \npatently offensive with respect to minors, exploits, is devoted to, \nor principally consists of descriptions of actual, simulated, or \nanimated displays or depictions of: (i) a person\u2019s pubic hair, anus, \nor genitals or the nipple of the female breast; (ii) touching, \ncaressing, or fondling of nipples, breasts, buttocks, anuses, or \ngenitals; or (iii) sexual intercourse, masturbation, sodomy, \nbestiality, oral copulation, flagellation, excretory functions, \nexhibitions, or any other sexual act; and (C) taken as a whole, lacks \nserious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value for minors.\u201d \nTex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code \u00a7 129B.001(6). \n\n7 \n \n \nany sexual content could qualify as obscene, H.B. 1181 \ncovers \u201call salacious material,\u201d from sex-education \ncontent to simulated sex scenes in Oscar-winning films.  \nPet. App. 109a, 115a.  And because H.B. 1181 applies to \nany website that devotes any more than one-third of its \ncontent to such sexual material, its restrictions apply to \nbroad swaths of speech that are not sexual\u2014much less \nobscene, even as to minors.  \nH.B. 1181 also contains several conspicuous \nexemptions.  It expressly exempts search engines, Tex. \nCiv. Prac. & Rem. Code \u00a7 129B.005(b), even though they \ncan provide access to the same sexual content as \ncovered websites, see Pet. App. 112a.  And the law de \nfacto exempts social-media sites that contain less than \none-third sexual material, even if those sites contain a \nlarger total volume of sexual content (including the \nsame content) as covered websites.  Pet. App. 113a. \nTo comply with \nH.B. 1181\u2019s age-verification \nrequirement, covered websites must \u201cverify that an \nindividual attempting to access the [site] is\u201d at least 18 \nyears old using \u201cdigital identification,\u201d \u201cgovernment-\nissued identification,\u201d or \u201ca commercially reasonable \nmethod that relies on public or private transactional \ndata.\u201d  Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code \u00a7\u00a7 129B.002(a), \n129B.003.  An entity conducting age verification \u201cmay \nnot retain any identifying information of the individual,\u201d \nid. \u00a7 129B.002(b), but H.B. 1181 imposes no limits on \ntransmitting that information to others.  Nor does H.B. \n1181 establish any data-security requirements or \ndisclosure prohibitions for entities conducting age \nverification or others that receive identification \ninformation as part of the verification process. \nH.B. 1181 also mandates that covered websites post \nscripted \u201csexual materials health warnings\u201d on the \n\n8 \n \n \n\u201clanding page\u201d of the website and \u201call advertisements,\u201d \nalong with \u201chelpline\u201d numbers for \u201csubstance abuse and \nmental health.\u201d  Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code \n\u00a7 129B.004 (capitalization altered).  The purported \nwarnings state that \u201c[p]ornography is potentially \nbiologically addictive\u201d and \u201cproven to harm human \nbrain development.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 129B.004(1); see id. \n(\u201cExposure to this content is associated with low self-\nesteem and body image, eating disorders, impaired \nbrain development, and other emotional and mental \nillnesses.\u201d).

Literature 236 (1973) ......................... 18\n\n \n \nINTRODUCTION \nAmericans hold a wide range of views about sexual \ncontent online.  Some view it as offensive or indecent; \nfor others, it is artistic, informative, or even essential to \nimportant parts of career and life.  Consistent with the \nbedrock First Amendment principle that \u201cesthetic and \nmoral judgments about art and literature \u2026 are for the \nindividual to make, not for the Government to decree,\u201d \nthis Court has long treated non-obscene sexual content \nas constitutionally protected for adults.  United States \nv. Playboy Ent. Grp., Inc., 529 U.S. 803, 818 (2000).  And \nwhile the Court has held that states may limit minors\u2019 \naccess to sexual material reasonably found harmful to \nthem, Ginsberg v. New York, 390 U.S. 629, 638-39 (1968), \nthe Court has uniformly held that a content-based \nburden on adults\u2019 access to such protected speech \u201ccan \nstand only if it satisfies strict scrutiny,\u201d Playboy, 529 \nU.S. at 813; see Ashcroft v. ACLU, 542 U.S. 656, 665-66 \n(2004); Reno v. ACLU, 521 U.S. 844, 874 (1997); Sable \nCommc\u2019ns v. FCC, 492 U.S. 115, 126 (1989). \nEnacted in 2023, Texas House Bill (H.B.) 1181 \nimposes requirements on commercial websites \u201cmore \nthan one-third of which\u201d are \u201csexual material harmful \nto minors\u201d\u2014a term that includes all sexually suggestive \ncontent, as might be found in romance novels or R-rated \nmovies.  Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code \u00a7 129B.002(a).  The \nlaw requires a covered website to verify the age of every \nuser, typically via government-issued identification.  Id.  \n\u00a7\u00a7 129B.002-003.  Entities conducting such verification \nmay not \u201cretain\u201d users\u2019 \u201cidentifying information,\u201d id. \n\u00a7 129B.002(b), but H.B. 1181 does not prohibit transfer \nof that information or impose any other protection \nagainst disclosure.  And while Texas insists that forcing \nusers to endure chilling online privacy and security \n\n2 \n \n \nrisks is necessary to protect minors from harmful \nsexual content, H.B. 1181 exempts the search engines \nand social-media platforms that are principal gateways \nfor minors\u2019 access to that very content.  Id. \u00a7 129B.005. \nConfirming Texas\u2019s real aims, H.B. 1181 also requires \ncovered websites to post stigmatizing, unscientific \n\u201c[w]arnings\u201d that condemn their content as harmful to \nhealth.  Id. \u00a7 129B.004. \nThe district court preliminarily enjoined H.B. 1181, \nfinding that the law is subject to strict scrutiny and \nlikely to fail it under this Court\u2019s governing precedent.  \nIn particular, the court explained that H.B. 1181\u2019s age-\nverification requirement is materially identical to the \nChild Online Protection Act (COPA), 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 231, \nwhich this Court in Ashcroft held was subject to strict \nscrutiny and likely unconstitutional.  The Fifth Circuit \nagreed that H.B. 1181 is materially identical to COPA, \nbut a divided panel held that it was not bound by \nAshcroft because that decision contains what the \nmajority termed \u201cstartling omissions.\u201d  Pet. App. \n17a.  The majority concluded that the proper level of \nscrutiny is instead rational-basis review, as applied in \nGinsberg.  To justify its departure from Ashcroft, the \nmajority reasoned that this Court there applied strict \nscrutiny to COPA only because Attorney General \nAshcroft, represented by Solicitor General Olson, \nerroneously accepted strict scrutiny rather than urging \nmere rational-basis review in defense of the statute.   \nAs recognized by Judge Higginbotham\u2019s dissent, the \nFifth Circuit veered astray.  This Court in Ashcroft did \nnot apply strict scrutiny to COPA based on an oversight \nor concession.  It did so because First Amendment \nprinciples and precedent firmly establish that strict \nscrutiny \napplies \nto \ncontent-based \nburdens \non \n\n3 \n \n \nconstitutionally protected speech, specifically including \nsexual content that is not obscene for adults.  Neither \nTexas\u2019s professed aim to protect minors nor Ginsberg\u2019s \nholding\u2014which applies only to the rights of minors\u2014\nalters that analysis.  The laws in Ashcroft, Reno, \nPlayboy, and Sable all aimed to protect minors, and this \nCourt applied strict scrutiny in each of those post-\nGinsberg decisions.  Strict scrutiny applies here too. \nUnder strict scrutiny, this is a straightforward \ncase.  As the district court found and the Fifth Circuit \ndid not question, H.B. 1181 is both overinclusive and \nunderinclusive, and it fails to pursue its objective with \nthe means least restrictive of adults\u2019 protected speech.  \nIndeed, Texas has disregarded the measure specifically \nidentified in Ashcroft as both less restrictive and more \neffective than online age-verification: content-filtering \nsoftware, which limits minors\u2019 access to sexual material \ninappropriate for them without burdening adults\u2019 \naccess to speech they have a right to receive.  That \nlegislative oversight is especially striking because \ncontent-filtering \ntechnology \nhas \nimproved \nsince \nAshcroft.  Meanwhile, online age-verification has grown \neasier to circumvent and threats of online identity theft, \nextortion, and data breaches have multiplied\u2014\nheightening chills in the highly sensitive and personal \ncontext of accessing sexual material. \nRestoring the preliminary injunction of H.B. 1181 by \nreversing the erroneous decision below would not \nundermine genuine efforts to limit minors\u2019 access to \nsexually inappropriate material.  Petitioners agree that \nprotecting minors is a compelling government interest \nand that\u2014as this Court expressly stated in Ashcroft\u2014a \nlaw narrowly tailored to that objective can survive strict \nscrutiny.  542 U.S. at 672-73.  The Fifth Circuit\u2019s \n\n4 \n \n \napplication of rational-basis review is therefore as \nunnecessary as it is wrong.  As in other recent cases, the \nCourt should adhere to \u201csettled principles about \nfreedom of expression\u201d that have \u201cserved the Nation \nwell over many years\u201d and reject the Fifth Circuit\u2019s \njarring departure from First Amendment precedent.  \nMoody v. NetChoice, LLC, 144 S. Ct. 2383, 2403 (2024).   \nOPINIONS BELOW \nThe Fifth Circuit\u2019s opinion (Pet. App. 1a-87a) is \nreported at 95 F.4th 263.  The opinion of the district \ncourt granting a preliminary injunction (Pet. App. 90a-\n161a) is reported at 689 F. Supp. 3d 373. \nJURISDICTION \nThe Fifth Circuit entered its judgment on March 7, \n2024.  Petitioners timely petitioned for certiorari on \nApril 12, 2024.  This Court has jurisdiction under 28 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 1254(1). \nCONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY \nPROVISIONS INVOLVED \nThe First Amendment to the United States \nConstitution provides in relevant part that \u201cCongress \nshall make no law \u2026 abridging the freedom of speech.\u201d  \nH.B. 1181 is reproduced in an appendix to this brief. \nSTATEMENT \nA. Legal And Factual Background \n1.  \u201cThe most basic\u201d principle of free speech is that \n\u201cgovernment has no power to restrict expression \nbecause of its message, its ideas, its subject matter, or \nits content.\u201d  Brown v. Ent. Merchs. Ass\u2019n, 564 U.S. 786, \n790-91 (2011) (citation omitted).  Generally, when a law \n\u201cimposes a restriction on the content of protected \n\n5 \n \n \nspeech, it is invalid unless \u2026 it passes strict scrutiny\u2014\nthat is, unless it is justified by a compelling government \ninterest and is narrowly drawn to serve that interest.\u201d  \nId. at 799.  Otherwise, content-based speech restrictions \nare permitted only in limited \u201chistoric and traditional \ncategories long familiar to the bar.\u201d  United States v. \nStevens, 559 U.S. 460, 468 (2010) (citation omitted).   \nOne such category is obscenity, defined as material \nthat \n\u201cdepicts \nor \ndescribes \n\u2026 \nsexual \ncontent\u201d \n(specifically identified by statute), in a \u201cpatently \noffensive\u201d way that \u201cappeals to the prurient interest,\u201d \nand, taken as a whole, \u201clacks serious literary, artistic, \npolitical, or scientific value.\u201d  Miller v. California, 413 \nU.S. 15, 24 (1973) (citation omitted).  In Ginsberg, the \nCourt upheld a state law that \u201cadjusts the definition of \nobscenity\u201d applicable to minors based on their different \nreaction to sexual content.  Id. at 638 (citation omitted).  \nAs to adults, however, the Court has \u201cmade it perfectly \nclear that \u2018sexual expression which is \u2026 not obscene is \nprotected by the First Amendment.\u2019\u201d  Reno, 521 U.S. at \n874 (brackets and citation omitted).  And the Court has \nrepeatedly held that laws imposing content-based \nburdens on adults\u2019 access to such constitutionally \nprotected expression are subject to strict scrutiny, even \nif the laws permissibly aim to restrict minors\u2019 access to \nsuch material.  Id.; see Ashcroft, 542 U.S. at 665-66; \nPlayboy, 529 U.S. at 813; Sable, 492 U.S. at 126. \nThe Court\u2019s most recent decision in that line of cases \nis Ashcroft.  There, the Court considered a challenge to \nCOPA, \nwhich \nprohibited\u2014absent \nage-verification \nmeasures\u2014the online transmission of content that \nCongress deemed obscene for minors using a modified \nobscenity standard like the one at issue in Ginsberg.  \n542 U.S. at 661-62.  Because COPA burdened adults\u2019 \n\n6 \n \n \naccess to speech constitutionally protected for them, the \nCourt held that strict scrutiny applied for the same \nreasons as in analogous prior cases.  Id. at 665-66 (citing \nReno, 521 U.S. at 874); see id. at 670 (citing Playboy, \n529 U.S. at 825-26).  The Court then upheld a \npreliminary injunction of COPA, determining that the \nstatute was likely unconstitutional because \u201cless \nrestrictive \nalternatives\u201d\u2014in \nparticular, \ncontent-\nfiltering software\u2014\u201cwould be at least as effective in \nachieving the legitimate purpose that the statute was \nenacted to serve.\u201d  Id. at 665 (quoting Reno, 521 U.S. at \n874); see id. at 665-66, 673. \n2.  Almost 20 years after Ashcroft, in June 2023, \nTexas enacted H.B. 1181.  H.B. 1181 requires age \nverification by any commercial website \u201cmore than one-\nthird of which is sexual material harmful to minors,\u201d \nTex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code \u00a7 129B.002(a), defined \nusing almost exactly the same modification of the adult \nobscenity standard that Congress adopted in COPA, id. \n\u00a7 129B.001(6).1  Because this statutory definition \napplies to even the youngest minors, for whom almost \n \n1  \nSpecifically, H.B. 1181 defines \u201c[s]exual material harmful \nto minors\u201d as including material that \u201c(A) the average person \napplying contemporary community standards would find, taking \nthe material as a whole and with respect to minors, is designed to \nappeal to or pander to the prurient interest; (B) in a manner \npatently offensive with respect to minors, exploits, is devoted to, \nor principally consists of descriptions of actual, simulated, or \nanimated displays or depictions of: (i) a person\u2019s pubic hair, anus, \nor genitals or the nipple of the female breast; (ii) touching, \ncaressing, or fondling of nipples, breasts, buttocks, anuses, or \ngenitals; or (iii) sexual intercourse, masturbation, sodomy, \nbestiality, oral copulation, flagellation, excretory functions, \nexhibitions, or any other sexual act; and (C) taken as a whole, lacks \nserious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value for minors.\u201d \nTex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code \u00a7 129B.001(6). \n\n7 \n \n \nany sexual content could qualify as obscene, H.B. 1181 \ncovers \u201call salacious material,\u201d from sex-education \ncontent to simulated sex scenes in Oscar-winning films.  \nPet. App. 109a, 115a.  And because H.B. 1181 applies to \nany website that devotes any more than one-third of its \ncontent to such sexual material, its restrictions apply to \nbroad swaths of speech that are not sexual\u2014much less \nobscene, even as to minors.  \nH.B. 1181 also contains several conspicuous \nexemptions.  It expressly exempts search engines, Tex. \nCiv. Prac. & Rem. Code \u00a7 129B.005(b), even though they \ncan provide access to the same sexual content as \ncovered websites, see Pet. App. 112a.  And the law de \nfacto exempts social-media sites that contain less than \none-third sexual material, even if those sites contain a \nlarger total volume of sexual content (including the \nsame content) as covered websites.  Pet. App. 113a. \nTo comply with \nH.B. 1181\u2019s age-verification \nrequirement, covered websites must \u201cverify that an \nindividual attempting to access the [site] is\u201d at least 18 \nyears old using \u201cdigital identification,\u201d \u201cgovernment-\nissued identification,\u201d or \u201ca commercially reasonable \nmethod that relies on public or private transactional \ndata.\u201d  Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code \u00a7\u00a7 129B.002(a), \n129B.003.  An entity conducting age verification \u201cmay \nnot retain any identifying information of the individual,\u201d \nid. \u00a7 129B.002(b), but H.B. 1181 imposes no limits on \ntransmitting that information to others.  Nor does H.B. \n1181 establish any data-security requirements or \ndisclosure prohibitions for entities conducting age \nverification or others that receive identification \ninformation as part of the verification process. \nH.B. 1181 also mandates that covered websites post \nscripted \u201csexual materials health warnings\u201d on the \n\n8 \n \n \n\u201clanding page\u201d of the website and \u201call advertisements,\u201d \nalong with \u201chelpline\u201d numbers for \u201csubstance abuse and \nmental health.\u201d  Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code \n\u00a7 129B.004 (capitalization altered).  The purported \nwarnings state that \u201c[p]ornography is potentially \nbiologically addictive\u201d and \u201cproven to harm human \nbrain development.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 129B.004(1); see id. \n(\u201cExposure to this content is associated with low self-\nesteem and body image, eating disorders, impaired \nbrain development, and other emotional and mental \nillnesses.\u201d).  The statements are attributed to \u201cTEXAS \nHEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES,\u201d id., even \nthough that agency has not issued any such findings, \nPet. App. 95a.   \nNoncompliant websites are subject to enforcement \nactions by the Texas Attorney General and face \npenalties ranging from injunctive relief to fines of up to \n$10,000 per day, plus enhancements of up to $250,000.  \nTex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code \u00a7 129B.006. \n3.  Online age-verification mandated by H.B. 1181 \nposes severe risks to Internet users that do not arise \nduring in-person identification checks.  A \u201csubstantial \nchilling effect\u201d results from demanding proof of \nindividual identity online: Adults who submit, for \nexample, a \u201cgovernment ID\u201d over the Internet to \n\u201caffirmatively identify themselves\u201d understand that \nthey are thereby exposing themselves to \u201cinadvertent \ndisclosures, leaks, or hacks.\u201d  Pet. App. 125a-126a.  The \nchilling effect is worse than ever now because Internet \n\u201c[u]sers today are more cognizant of privacy concerns\u201d \nand \u201cdata breaches have become more high-profile\u201d and \ncommonplace.  Pet. App. 127a.  Adults\u2019 reasonable \nconcerns are compounded by H.B. 1181\u2019s failure to \nprohibit the transmission of adults\u2019 information to third \n\n9 \n \n \nparties\u2014including the government, creating the risk of \n\u201cstate monitoring\u201d of \u201cwhat kind of websites they visit.\u201d  \nPet. App. 125a-126a.  And H.B. 1181\u2019s deterrent effect \non adults\u2019 \u201caccess to sexual material\u201d is \u201cparticularly \nacute\u201d because it \u201ccan reveal intimate desires and \npreferences.\u201d  Pet. App. 125a.  Correspondingly, such \ninformation is \u201cmore likely to be targeted\u201d by identity \nthieves and extortionists because \u201cusers may be more \nwilling to pay to keep that information private.\u201d  Pet. \nApp. 127a. \nB. Procedural History \n1. District Court Proceedings \nPetitioners challenged H.B. 1181 soon after it was \nsigned.  Pet. App. 90a.  After an evidentiary hearing, the \ndistrict court issued an order preliminarily enjoining \nenforcement of H.B. 1181 before it became effective, \naccompanied by a lengthy decision explaining the \nfactual findings and legal reasoning underlying the \norder.  Pet. App. 90a-161a.  \na.  The district court held that petitioners are likely \nto succeed on the merits.  Under Reno and Ashcroft, the \ncourt explained, H.B. 1181 is subject to strict scrutiny \nbecause it is a content-based burden on adults\u2019 access to \nprotected speech.  Pet. App. 107a-111a.  While crediting \nTexas\u2019s compelling interest in protecting minors from \nharmful content, the court held that H.B. 1181\u2019s age-\nverification mandate likely does not withstand strict \nscrutiny because it is an underinclusive and overly \nrestrictive means of pursuing that interest, particularly \ngiven the availability of more effective, less restrictive \nalternatives.  Pet. App. 111a-136a.   \nThe district court first explained that H.B. 1181\u2019s \nexemptions of search engines and social media render it \n\n10 \n \n \n\u201cseverely underinclusive.\u201d  Pet. App. 112a-114a.  The \ncourt found that minors can easily locate \u201csexually \nexplicit or pornographic\u201d content on search engines \nthrough \u201cvisual search\u201d\u2014i.e., a search for images or \nvideos.  Pet. App. 112a.  The court also found that social-\nmedia platforms like Instagram and Facebook contain \n\u201cmaterial which is sexually explicit for minors,\u201d and \nsites like Reddit \u201cmaintain entire communities and \nforums\u201d devoted \u201cto posting online pornography.\u201d  Pet. \nApp. 113a.  Because such outlets are the most frequent \nsources for minors to access sexual content, yet none is \nregulated by H.B. 1181, the court found that the law \n\u201cfails to reduce the online pornography that is most \nreadily available to minors.\u201d  Pet. App. 113a.   \nThe district court similarly found that H.B. 1181\u2019s \nage-verification requirement is overly restrictive \nbecause it \u201csweeps far beyond obscene material and \nincludes all content offensive to minors, while failing to \nexempt material that has cultural, scientific, or \neducational value to adults only.\u201d  Pet. App. 122a.  The \ncourt added that the Texas legislature did not \u201ceven \nconsider[] the law\u2019s tailoring or ma[ke] any effort \nwhatsoever to choose the least-restrictive measure.\u201d  \nPet. App. 135a.  Indeed, the court found that Texas\u2019s \nown evidence\u2014along with petitioners\u2019\u2014identified less \nrestrictive and more effective alternatives.  In \nparticular, the legislature paid no heed to updated and \nimproved forms of the content-filtering software that \nthis Court found superior to online age-verification in \nAshcroft.  Pet. App. 128a-135a.  While Texas contended \nthat changes in technology should alter the judicial \nanalysis\u2014positing age verification as \u201cmore secure and \nconvenient\u201d and content filtering as obsolete\u2014the court \nfound that Texas\u2019s argument \u201csimply does not match \nthe evidence.\u201d  Pet. App. 127a.   \n\n11 \n \n \nb.  The district court also held that H.B. 1181\u2019s \nmandated health warnings are likely unconstitutionally \ncompelled speech.  Pet. App. 136a-150a.  Under \nNational Institute of Family and Life Advocates v. \nBecerra, 585 U.S. 755 (2018) (NIFLA), the court held \nthat the speech mandate is subject to strict scrutiny, \nwhich it likely cannot survive.  Pet. App. 137a-143a.  The \ncourt emphasized that, as a result of the age verification \nrequired by H.B. 1181, the warnings would be seen \npredominantly by adults, contrary to H.B. 1181\u2019s stated \npurpose of protecting minors.  Pet. App. 142a.  And even \nif the warnings are treated as a commercial-speech \nmandate subject to lesser scrutiny, the court held they \ncannot survive because they are not \u201cpurely factual and \nuncontroversial.\u201d  Pet. App. 145a (quoting Zauderer v. \nOff. of Disciplinary Couns., 471 U.S. 626, 651 (1985)). \nc.  Finally, the district court held that a preliminary \ninjunction is justified because H.B. 1181, if enforced, \nwill cause irreparable harm to petitioners and adult \nTexans by chilling access to protected sexual expression \nand compelling speech.  Pet. App. 156a.  In enjoining \nH.B. 1181, the court noted that \u201cnothing in th[e court\u2019s] \norder prevents the state from pursuing\u201d the other \n\u201cviable and constitutional means\u201d available \u201cto achieve \nTexas\u2019s goal\u201d of protecting minors.  Pet. App. 160a. \n2. Court Of Appeals Proceedings \na.  Texas appealed and sought a stay pending appeal \nfrom the Fifth Circuit.  See Pet. App. 167a-168a.  The \nmotions panel entered an administrative stay without \nany stated reasons, lasting nearly two months, during \nwhich time the parties briefed and argued the appeal.  \nPet. App. 167a-168a.  The merits panel then issued an \nunexplained stay pending appeal by a 2-1 vote, which \nlasted roughly another four months.  Pet. App. 166a & \n\n12 \n \n \nn.1 (noting Judge Higginbotham\u2019s dissenting vote).  \nDuring this period, Texas began enforcement actions.  \nSee C.A. Dkt. #131. \nb.  On March 7, 2024, the Fifth Circuit merits panel \nupheld the preliminary injunction unanimously as to the \nhealth-warning provision, Pet. App. 27a-38a, but held by \na 2-1 vote that petitioners were unlikely to succeed in \nchallenging the age-verification provision, Pet. App. 8a-\n27a.  The panel accordingly vacated the preliminary \ninjunction as to the age-verification provision over \nJudge Higginbotham\u2019s dissent.  Pet. App. 44a. \nThe panel majority acknowledged that H.B. 1181\u2019s \nage-verification requirement is \u201cvery similar\u201d to the \nCOPA provisions addressed by this Court in Ashcroft, \nrejecting Texas\u2019s purported distinctions of the two \nstatutes.  Pet. App. 16a.  Nevertheless, the majority \nheld that rational-basis review is the applicable \nstandard of scrutiny given Ginsberg.  Pet. App. 17a, 26a.  \nThe majority acknowledged that its holding departs \nfrom Ashcroft, but it declined to follow this Court\u2019s \ndecision in that case.  Pet. App. 16a-19a.  It deemed the \nAshcroft Court\u2019s lack of \u201cdiscussion of rational-basis \nreview under Ginsberg\u201d a \u201cstartling omission[]\u201d that \ncould \u201conly\u201d be explained by the failure of the United \nStates to argue for the application of rational-basis \nreview\u2014a non-jurisdictional error that the Court \npurportedly \u201cdid not have to correct\u201d on its own.  Pet. \nApp. 17a-18a.      \nThe panel majority similarly declined to apply other \nprecedents holding that strict scrutiny applies to \ncontent-based \nburdens \non \nadults\u2019 \naccess \nto \nconstitutionally protected sexual expression.  Pet. App. \n13a-16a, 20a-26a (discussing Reno, Playboy, and Sable).  \nThe majority contended that none of these cases could \n\n13 \n \n \n\u201csurmount the rock that is Ginsberg.\u201d  Pet. App. 20a.  \nThe majority then held that H.B. 1181\u2019s age-verification \nprovision \u201ceasily\u201d survives rational-basis review.  Pet. \nApp. 26a.   \nJudge Higginbotham dissented, relying on Sable, \nReno, Playboy, and Ashcroft.  Pet. App. 45a-87a.  H.B. \n1181 \u201cmust face strict scrutiny review,\u201d he explained, \n\u201cbecause it limits adults\u2019 access to protected speech \nusing a content-based distinction.\u201d  Pet. App. 47a-48a.  \nHe added that Ginsberg \u201chas no purchase\u201d in \naddressing \u201ca challenge to an adult\u2019s ability to access \nconstitutionally protected materials\u201d online, because \nGinsberg held \u201cthat minors have more limited First \nAmendment rights than adults.\u201d  Pet. App. 56a-57a.  \nFinding no clear error in the district court\u2019s findings, he \nwould have affirmed the preliminary injunction in full.  \nPet. App. 68a-78a.   \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nH.B. \n1181\u2019s \nage-verification \nrequirement \nis \nunconstitutional under a straightforward application of \nFirst Amendment principles and precedent.  The \npreliminary injunction should accordingly be restored. \nA.  When speech is protected by the First \nAmendment, a content-based burden on that speech \ntriggers strict scrutiny.  H.B. 1181\u2019s age-verification \nrequirement fits squarely within that rule.  The age-\nverification requirement is triggered by speech that \nTexas has deemed inappropriate for minors but that is \nconstitutionally protected for adults.  It is facially \ncontent-based, applying only to specified sexual \nmaterial.  And it imposes a clear burden, forcing adult \nusers to incur severe privacy and security risks\u2014which \n\n14 \n \n \nthe statute leaves largely unaddressed\u2014before they \ncan access constitutionally protected speech. \nBasic principles of free speech thus call for strict \nscrutiny.  And this Court\u2019s precedent removes all \ndoubt.  In an unbroken line of cases dating back \ndecades, the Court has uniformly applied strict scrutiny \nto laws that do what H.B. 1181 does\u2014burden adults\u2019 \naccess to non-obscene sexual content, which is \nconstitutionally protected for them, while attempting to \nrestrict minors\u2019 access to that content.  That line of \ncases culminated in Ashcroft, in which eight Justices \napplied \nstrict \nscrutiny \nto \na \nlaw \nmaterially \nindistinguishable from H.B. 1181. \nWithout attempting to distinguish Ashcroft, the \nFifth Circuit dismissed it by speculating that this Court \ndid not really mean that strict scrutiny applies to laws \nlike COPA and H.B. 1181.  That position is as \nremarkable as it is mistaken.  Lower federal courts \nmay not disregard this Court\u2019s decisions, even if they \n(mis)perceive \n\u201comissions\u201d \nin \nthe \nCourt\u2019s \nreasoning.  Pet. App. 17a.  Regardless, Ashcroft \nevidences no omission.  The Ashcroft Court subjected \nCOPA to strict scrutiny because that is what the First \nAmendment requires, as the United States recognized \nin defending the statute.  The Court did not adopt the \nrational-basis review standard of Ginsberg, because \nthat standard applies to the definition of obscenity for \nminors\u2014not the imposition of burdens on adults, as this \nCourt\u2019s post-Ginsberg decisions in Reno, Playboy, and \nSable confirm. \nB.  Under the proper standard of strict scrutiny, \nthis case is readily resolved.  As the district court found \nand the Fifth Circuit did not refute, H.B. 1181\u2019s age-\nverification requirement is triply flawed: it is \n\n15 \n \n \noverinclusive, underinclusive, and not the least \nrestrictive means of pursuing the state\u2019s interest in \nprotecting minors.  It is overinclusive because\u2014\nthrough its application to entire websites that have \nmore than one-third content inappropriate for minors\u2014\nit restricts adults\u2019 access to speech that is not even \nsexual and not even arguably obscene for minors.  It is \nunderinclusive because it exempts search engines and \nsocial-media sites that make available to minors huge \nquantities of the same content that the statute restricts \non petitioners\u2019 websites.  And it fails to adopt less \nrestrictive \nand \nmore \neffective \nalternatives \nto \nburdensome online age-verification, such as the \ncontent-filtering software that this Court identified in \nAshcroft.  Each of those defects is independently fatal; \ntogether, they underscore that H.B. 1181 is designed \nforemost to target disfavored speakers\u2014whom the law \nbrands with self-condemning \u201chealth warnings\u201d\u2014\nrather than to meet the state\u2019s purported objective.  \nSuch speaker-based discrimination affords yet another \nreason why petitioners\u2019 challenge will likely succeed. \nC.  Petitioners satisfy the remaining requirements \nfor a preliminary injunction.  They, along with Texas \nadults, are irreparably harmed by the loss of their First \nAmendment freedoms and the prospect of crippling \nenforcement \nproceedings \nand \nunrecoverable \ncompliance costs.  Moreover, the equities and public \ninterest strongly favor enjoining enforcement of the \nstatute until the litigation is complete\u2014just as was true \nfor the comparable laws in Reno and Ashcroft. \n\n16 \n \n \nARGUMENT \nTHE PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION OF THE AGE-\nVERIFICATION REQUIREMENT IN H.B. 1181 \nSHOULD BE RESTORED \nA \u201cplaintiff seeking a preliminary injunction must \nestablish that he is likely to succeed on the merits, that \nhe is likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of \npreliminary relief, that the balance of equities tips in his \nfavor, and that an injunction is in the public interest.\u201d  \nWinter v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 20 \n(2008).  Here, as in most First Amendment cases, the \nprincipal \nquestion \nis \nwhether \npetitioners \nhave \n\u201cdemonstrated that they are likely to succeed on the \nmerits.\u201d  Ashcroft, 542 U.S. at 666.  As the district court \ncorrectly concluded, they have.  Because petitioners \nalso satisfy the relevant equitable factors, the \npreliminary injunction should be restored.  See Pet. App. \n45a-87a (Higginbotham, J., dissenting). \nA. The Age-Verification Requirement In H.B. \n1181 Is Subject To Strict Scrutiny \n1. Strict Scrutiny Applies To Content-Based \nBurdens On Protected Speech  \na.  \u201cThe First Amendment, applicable to the States \nthrough the Fourteenth Amendment, prohibits laws \nthat abridge the freedom of speech.\u201d  NIFLA, 585 U.S. \nat 766. It is a \u201cfundamental principle\u201d of the First \nAmendment that states typically cannot restrict \nprotected speech \u201cbecause of its message, its ideas, its \nsubject matter, or its content.\u201d  NIFLA, 585 U.S. at 766 \n(quoting Police Dept. v. Mosley, 408 U.S. 92, 95 (1972)).  \nSuch restrictions \u201care presumptively unconstitutional\u201d \nand generally may be justified only if they overcome the \n\u201cstringent standard\u201d of strict scrutiny.  Id.  The Court \n\n17 \n \n \nhas applied that principle to speech of many different \nforms, from outdoor signs to violent video games to \ndepictions of animal cruelty to sexually suggestive \ncontent on television and the Internet\u2014just to name a \nfew examples from recent years.  See Reed v. Town of \nGilbert, 576 U.S. 155, 159 (2015); Brown, 564 U.S. at 799; \nStevens, 559 U.S. at 468-69; Playboy, 529 U.S. at 813-14; \nReno, 521 U.S. at 874; see also Barr v. Am. Ass\u2019n of Pol. \nConsultants, Inc., 591 U.S. 610, 618-19 (2020) (plurality \nopinion) (applying strict scrutiny to restrictions on \nrobocalls); id. at 650 (Gorsuch, J., concurring in the \njudgment in part and dissenting in part) (same).  In \nshort, the First Amendment generally \u201cbars the \ngovernment from dictating what we see or read or \nspeak or hear.\u201d  Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coal., 535 U.S. \n234, 245 (2002).  \nThe First Amendment confers that broad protection \nnot because any \u201cone idea is as good as any other\u201d;  the \n\u201cConstitution no more enforces a relativistic philosophy \nor moral nihilism than it does any other point of view.\u201d  \nPlayboy, 529 U.S. at 818.  The First Amendment \nbroadly protects speech because \u201cit is difficult to \ndistinguish\u201d high-value speech from low-value speech \nand \u201cdangerous\u201d for the government \u201cto try.\u201d  Brown, \n564 U.S. at 790.  \u201cWhat is one man\u2019s amusement, \nteaches another\u2019s doctrine.\u201d  Id. (quoting Winters v. \nNew York, 333 U.S. 507, 510 (1948)).  The First \nAmendment \u201cexists precisely so that opinions and \njudgments, including esthetic and moral judgments \nabout art and literature, can be formed, tested, and \nexpressed.\u201d  Playboy, 529 U.S. at 818.  And, with few \nexceptions, those \u201cjudgments are for the individual to \nmake, not for the Government to decree, even with the \nmandate or approval of a majority.\u201d  Id. \n\n18 \n \n \nb.  The Court has long applied these principles to \nspeech involving sex.  Although obscenity is historically \nunprotected, \u201csex and obscenity are not synonymous,\u201d \nand the non-obscene \u201cportrayal of sex \u2026 in art, \nliterature, and scientific works\u201d has never been \nregarded as \u201csufficient reason to deny material the \nconstitutional protection of freedom of speech and \npress.\u201d  Roth v. United States, 354 U.S. 476, 487 (1957).  \nTo the contrary, sex has been \u201ca subject of absorbing \ninterest to mankind through the ages\u201d and remains \u201cone \nof the vital problems of human interest and public \nconcern.\u201d  Id.; see, e.g., Reno, 521 U.S. at 877-78 \n(collecting examples of sexual material \u201cwith serious \neducational or other value\u201d); see also Free Speech Coal., \n535 U.S. at 246-48 (2002) (discussing the theme of sex in \nart and literature dating back to Shakespeare).   \n\u201cSexual expression and imagery were common, \nwidespread, legal, and quite explicit\u201d before and during \nthe Founding era.  Geoffrey R. Stone, Sex and the First \nAmendment, 17 First Amend. L. Rev. 134, 135 (2022).  \nAmerican colonial bookstores \u201ccarried an extraordinary \narray of erotica,\u201d id., and prominent figures \u201clike \nBenjamin Franklin and Thomas Jefferson collected \nmany [such] works,\u201d Geoffrey R. Stone, Sex and the \nConstitution 83 (2017).  Jefferson\u2019s library, for example, \ncontained numerous publications that \u201cportrayed vivid \nscenes of sexuality, lust, and sexual scandal.\u201d  Id.; see 4 \nCatalogue of the Library of Thomas Jefferson 433-36, \n447, 456, 553-54 (E. Millicent Sowerby ed., 1955).  And \nmany Americans \u201cread sex manuals\u201d such as Aristotle\u2019s \nMasterpiece\u2014an \u201cerotic\u201d anthology understood to have \nmedical value.  Vern L. Bullough, An Early American \nSex Manual, Or, Aristotle Who?, 7 Early Am. \nLiterature 236, 236, 241 (1973); see John D\u2019Amelio & \nEstelle B. Freedman, Intimate Matters: A History of \n\n19 \n \n \nSexuality in America 19 (1988) (describing that \u201chighly \npopular\u201d work as \u201ca compendium of reproductive lore\u201d).  \nObjections to such non-obscene sexual publications on \nreligious, moral, aesthetic, and other grounds were \ngenerally pursued through private restrictions, not \npublic laws; \u201cthe distribution, exhibition, and possession \nof pornographic material was simply not thought to be \nany of the state\u2019s business.\u201d  Sex and the First \nAmendment, supra, at 135.   \nIn keeping with that history and understanding, this \nCourt has exercised \u201c[c]easeless vigilance\u201d to protect \nadults\u2019 access to sexual material that does not fall within \nthe definition of obscenity, Roth, 354 U.S. at 488, even \nthough some may \u201cfind [it] shabby, offensive, or even \nugly,\u201d Playboy, 529 U.S. at 826.  That is consistent with \nthe \n\u201cbedrock \nprinciple \nunderlying \nthe \nFirst \nAmendment \u2026 that the government may not prohibit \nthe expression of an idea simply because society finds \nthe idea itself offensive or disagreeable.\u201d  Snyder v. \nPhelps, 562 U.S. 443, 458 (2011) (quoting Texas v. \nJohnson, 491 U.S. 397, 414 (1989)); see Free Speech \nCoal., 535 U.S. at 245 (\u201c[S]peech may not be prohibited \nbecause \nit \nconcerns \nsubjects \noffending \nour \nsensibilities.\u201d).  Indeed, \u201cthe point of all speech \nprotection ... is to shield just those choices of content \nthat in someone\u2019s eyes are misguided, or even hurtful.\u201d  \nSnyder, 562 U.S. at 458 (citation omitted); see 303 \nCreative LLC v. Elenis, 600 U.S. 570, 602 (2023) (\u201cA \ncommitment to speech for only some messages and \nsome persons is no commitment at all.\u201d). \nc.  The distinction between unprotected obscenity \nand protected speech about sex applies to people of all \nages.  In Ginsberg, however, this Court held that the \nline can be drawn in a different place with respect to \n\n20 \n \n \nminors.  390 U.S. at 638.  The Court in Ginsberg upheld \na New York law that prohibited the knowing sale to \nminors of sexual material \u201cdefined to be obscene on the \nbasis of its appeal to them whether or not it would be \nobscene to adults.\u201d  Id. at 631.  Rejecting a challenge \nasserted on behalf of minors, the Court determined that \nthe law permissibly \u201cadjusts the definition of obscenity \n\u2018to social realities by permitting the appeal of this type \nof material to be assessed in term of the sexual \ninterests\u2019\u201d of minors, which differ from those of adults.  \nId. at 638 (quoting Mishkin v. New York, 383 U.S. 502, \n509 (1966)).  Because the line drawn by the state has a \n\u201crational relation to the objective of safeguarding such \nminors from harm,\u201d the Court held, the law did not \nviolate minors\u2019 First Amendment rights.  Id. at 643. \nThe Court\u2019s decision in Ginsberg marks an exception \nto the general principle that minors and adults enjoy the \nsame First Amendment protections, and the Court has \ndeclined to extend Ginsberg beyond the narrow context \nin which it was decided.  See Brown, 564 U.S. at 793-95 \n(rejecting California\u2019s reliance on Ginsberg to prohibit \nthe sale of violent video games to minors).  Most \ncritically for present purposes, however, Ginsberg\u2019s \ntolerance of a more restrictive obscenity definition for \nminors does not in any way diminish the constitutional \nprotection of non-obscene sexual expression for adults.  \nThe law at issue in Ginsberg did not place any \nrestriction on adults\u2019 access to sexual materials; it did \nnot, for example, require sellers to conduct age \nverification of adult customers.  See 390 U.S. at 634.  To \nthe \ncontrary, \nthe \nGinsberg \nCourt \nexpressly \ndistinguished New York\u2019s restriction on minors\u2019 access \nto sexual content from a Michigan law that barred the \nsale to adults and minors of content deemed harmful to \nminors, id.\u2014a law the Court unanimously invalidated as \n\n21 \n \n \nviolating the First Amendment.  Butler v. Michigan, \n352 U.S. 380, 383-84 (1957) (refusing to \u201creduce the \nadult population of Michigan to reading only what is fit \nfor children,\u201d which would impermissibly \u201cburn the \nhouse to roast the pig\u201d). \nThe Court has since reaffirmed in an unbroken line \nof ensuing decisions that a burden on adults\u2019 access to \nsexual material constitutionally protected for them is \nsubject to strict scrutiny even if that burden arises from \na law aimed at restricting minors\u2019 access to sexual \nmaterial that is not constitutionally protected for them.  \nSee, e.g., Reno, 521 U.S. at 975 (\u201c[T]he level of discourse \nreaching a mailbox simply cannot be limited to that \nwhich would be suitable for a sandbox.\u201d (quoting Bolger \nv. Youngs Drug Prods. Corp., 463 U.S. 60, 74-75 (1983)).   \nIn Sable, for example, the Court considered a \nfederal law prohibiting \u201cdial-a-porn\u201d telephone services \ncontaining content that was constitutionally protected \nfor adults but inappropriate for minors.  492 U.S. at 117, \n126.  Given the burden on adults, the Court subjected \nthe law to strict scrutiny.  Id. at 126.  And while the \nCourt accepted the government\u2019s \u201ccompelling interest \nin protecting the physical and psychological well-being \nof minors,\u201d the Court invalidated the law because it \n\u201cwas not sufficiently narrowly drawn \u2026 to serve those \ninterests without unnecessarily interfering with [the] \nFirst Amendment freedoms\u201d of adults.  Id. \nThe Court followed the same approach in Playboy.  \nThere, a federal law required cable-television operators \noffering \nchannels \n\u201cprimarily \ndedicated \nto\u201d \nprogramming that was \u201csexually-oriented\u201d but not \nobscene for adults to either block their channels or \nbroadcast them only late at night, when children were \nnot likely to be watching.  529 U.S. at 806.  The Court \n\n22 \n \n \nagain acknowledged the government\u2019s interest in \nstopping \u201cunwanted, indecent speech\u201d from entering \n\u201cthe home without parental consent,\u201d but emphasized \nthat, because the law burdened adults\u2019 access to sexual \nexpression that is constitutionally protected for them, \nthe \u201cstandard the Government must meet\u201d to restrict \nthat speech \u201cshould be clear:  The standard is strict \nscrutiny.\u201d  Id. at 814.  The Court rejected the argument \nthat a lower level of scrutiny should apply because \nadults could still watch the programming late at night; \nthe Court explained that \u201c[t]he Government\u2019s content-\nbased burdens must satisfy the same rigorous scrutiny \nas its content-based bans.\u201d  Id. at 812.  After finding \nthat effective, less restrictive alternatives existed\u2014for \nexample, \u201ca regime in which viewers could order signal \nblocking on a household-by-household basis\u201d\u2014the \nCourt invalidated the law.  Id. at 807, 826-27. \nIn Reno, the Court extended those principles to \nsexual content specifically on the Internet.  The Court \naffirmed a preliminary injunction of a federal law that \n\u201cprohibit[ed] the knowing transmission of obscene or \nindecent messages\u201d online \u201cto any recipient under 18 \nyears of age,\u201d unless certain age-verification measures \nwere employed.  Reno, 521 U.S. at 859-61.  While \nrecognizing Ginsberg\u2019s holding that the \u201cscope of the \nconstitutional freedom of expression secured to a citizen\u201d \nto access sexually explicit material may \u201cdepend on \nwhether the citizen is an adult or a minor,\u201d the Reno \nCourt followed Playboy and Sable by applying strict \nscrutiny to the statute because it burdened adults\u2019 \naccess to speech that was constitutionally protected for \nthem.  Id. at 864-65, 874-77.  The Court affirmed the \npreliminary injunction, noting the government had \nfailed \u201cto explain why a less restrictive\u201d measure such \n\n23 \n \n \nas content \u201ctagg[ing],\u201d a nascent form of content \nfiltering, would not similarly protect minors.  Id. at 879. \nMost recently, the Court applied the same principles \nto COPA in Ashcroft.  As noted above, COPA prohibited \nthe online transmission of content deemed obscene for \nminors\u2014using Miller\u2019s adult-obscenity standard from \nthe perspective of a minor\u2014unless age-verification \nmeasures were employed.  See pp. 5-6, supra.  As in \nReno, Playboy, and Sable, the Ashcroft Court applied \nstrict scrutiny based on the law\u2019s burden on adults\u2019 \naccess to protected speech.  542 U.S. at 665-66.  The \nCourt then affirmed a preliminary injunction of COPA.  \nIt explained that the use of \u201cblocking and filtering \nsoftware\u201d would be an effective and less restrictive \nmeans of restricting minors\u2019 access to online sexual \ncontent inappropriate for them, while still allowing \nadults to access the \u201cspeech they have a right to see \nwithout having to identify themselves\u201d and thereby \nincur \u201cthe potential chilling effect\u201d of age verification.  \nId. at 666-67.2 \nTaken together, the teaching of those cases is \nunmistakable:  Strict scrutiny applies to laws that \nburden adults\u2019 right to access sexual expression that is \nconstitutionally protected for them, even if those laws \nare aimed at preventing minors\u2019 exposure to that \ncontent.  Indeed, prior to the majority decision below, \nevery court of appeals that encountered a similar law \nreviewed it under strict scrutiny.  See Mukasey, 534 F.3d \nat 190; PSInet v. Chapman, 362 F.3d 227, 229, 233-34 \n \n2  Following remand, the district court permanently enjoined \nCOPA, the Third Circuit affirmed under strict scrutiny, and this \nCourt denied review.  See ACLU v. Mukasey, 534 F.3d 181, 190, \n207 (3d Cir. 2008), cert. denied, 555 U.S. 1137 (2009). \n\n24 \n \n \n(4th Cir. 2004); Am. Booksellers Found. v. Dean, 342 \nF.3d 96, 99-102 (2d Cir. 2003); ACLU v. Johnson, 194 \nF.3d 1149, 1152, 1155-58 (10th Cir. 1999).   \n2. H.B. 1181\u2019s Age-Verification Requirement \nIs A Content-Based Burden On Protected \nSpeech Subject To Strict Scrutiny \nLike the laws in Ashcroft, Playboy, Reno, and Sable, \nH.B. 1181\u2019s age-verification requirement applies to \nspeech that is constitutionally protected for adults and \nimposes a content-based burden on adults\u2019 access to \nthat speech.  It is therefore subject to strict scrutiny.   \na.  The speech covered by H.B. 1181\u2019s age-\nverification requirement is constitutionally protected \nfor adults.  Like COPA, H.B. 1181 applies to speech that \nsatisfies the Miller adult-obscenity test modified to \ncover sexual material that is deemed harmful from the \nperspective of a minor.  Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code \n\u00a7 129B.001(6); see Ashcroft, 542 U.S. at 661-62.  H.B. \n1181, moreover, applies to minors generally\u2014with no \ndistinction between, e.g., a 17-year-old and a 5-year-\nold\u2014so content that would be harmful to even the \nyoungest minor is covered by the statute.  \u201cBecause \nmost sexual content is offensive to young minors, the \nlaw covers virtually all salacious material,\u201d Pet App. \n109a, from nude modeling to romance novels to R-rated \nmovies or television shows for mature audiences, id. at \n51a-52a (Higginbotham, J., dissenting).  That material \nis all undisputedly protected for adults. \nNor is H.B. 1181 directed at speech that is obscene \nfor adults.  Texas separately criminalizes such obscenity, \nleaving no need to subject it to age verification.  Tex. \nPenal Code \u00a7\u00a7 43.21-43.23.  As such, adult obscenity is \nnot part of the constitutional analysis.  See Free Speech \n\n25 \n \n \nCoal., 535 U.S. at 240 (not considering obscene speech \nin the constitutional analysis because the statute at \nissue \u201cis not directed at speech that is obscene\u201d and \n\u201cCongress has proscribed those materials through a \nseparate statute\u201d); Reno, 521 U.S. at 878 n.44 (similar).  \nThe point is so plain that Texas conceded it at oral \nargument below.  Asked whether \u201cthe state take[s] the \nposition that the adults should be able to access all of \nth[e] material\u201d covered by H.B. 1181, or instead \u201cthat \nsome of th[e covered material] is obscene,\u201d the state \nresponded: \u201cadults should still be able to access every \nbit of the materials.\u201d  Official Recording at 13:35-14:00, \nhttps://bit.ly/4c5B42K. \nb.  It is equally clear that H.B. 1181\u2019s age-\nverification requirement is content-based.  The \nrequirement applies only to websites that provide \n\u201csexual material harmful to minors.\u201d  Tex. Civ. Prac. & \nRem. Code \u00a7\u00a7 129B.001(6), 129B.002(a).  This definition \nis content-based on its face and indistinguishable from \nthe one that triggered strict scrutiny in Ashcroft; it is \nlikewise of a piece with the restrictions that triggered \nstrict scrutiny in Reno, Playboy, and Sable.  What is \nmore, H.B. 1181\u2019s content-based definition is especially \nbroad:  it sweeps in all of a website\u2019s non-sexual content \njust because more than one-third of the website \ncontains the targeted sexual content.  Tex. Civ. Prac. & \nRem. Code \u00a7 129B.002(a).3   \nc.  Nor can there be any serious dispute that H.B. \n1181\u2019s age-verification requirement imposes a burden.  \nCovered websites must require adults to provide their \n \n3  The \u201chealth-warnings\u201d mandate likewise applies based on \nthe content of websites\u2019 speech and further compels the utterance \nof particular words.  Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code \u00a7 129B.004.   \n\n26 \n \n \npersonally identifying information whenever they wish \nto access constitutionally protected sexual speech.  As \nis clear from the district court\u2019s unchallenged \nfindings\u2014along with common sense and experience\u2014\nmany adults will understandably be reluctant to do so.  \nPet. \nApp. \n124a-127a. \n \nSubmitting \nidentifying \ninformation online entails risks of \u201cinadvertent \ndisclosures, leaks, or hacks,\u201d all of which are heightened \nbecause the disclosure of personal information here \ncould \u201creveal intimate desires and preferences.\u201d  Pet. \nApp. 125a-126a; see Electronic Frontier Found. (EFF) \nCert. Amicus Br. 6 (elaborating security risks). \nH.B. 1181 does little to assuage these concerns.  \nWhile requiring that age-verification providers \u201cmay \nnot retain any identifying information,\u201d Tex. Civ. Prac. \n& Rem. Code \u00a7 129B.002(b), H.B. 1181 does not prohibit \nthe transmission of such information to third parties, \nincluding to criminals or the state.  It is \u201cdubious,\u201d \nmoreover, that adults will \u201ctrust that companies will \nactually delete it.\u201d  Pet. App. 126a.  Beyond creating \nrisks of potentially devastating identify theft and \nextortion, the law ushers in the chilling prospect that \n\u201cthe state government can log and track adults\u2019 access \nto sexual material.\u201d  Pet. App. 75a (Higginbotham, J., \ndissenting).  And even if those worst-case scenarios are \nnot realized, their specter will have a significant (and \nostensibly designed) deterrent effect.  Pet. App. 126a; \nsee, e.g., Denver Area Educ. Telecomms. Consortium, \nInc. v. FCC, 518 U.S. 727, 754 (1996) (crediting such \nrisks in the context of adults\u2019 access to sexual content).4   \n \n4   The \u201chealth-warnings mandate,\u201d which demands that \nwebsites stigmatize and condemn adult users by \u201cwarning\u201d them \naway, confirms that such deterrence is by design. \n\n27 \n \n \nFor many adults, moreover, H.B. 1181 \u201coperates as \na de facto ban.\u201d  Found. for Individual Rights and \nExpression (FIRE) Cert. Amicus Br. 8.  \u201cTexans who do \nnot possess government identification or whose age or \nidentity are not reliably confirmed by commercial age-\nverification systems will be functionally prohibited from \nvisiting sites\u201d subject to the law.  Id.  This is not \nhypothetical: \u201c[a]bout 15 million adult citizens do not \nhave a driver\u2019s license, while about 2.6 million do not \nhave any form of government-issued photo ID.\u201d  EFF \nCert. Amicus Br. 10.  \nIn sum, H.B. 1181\u2019s age-verification requirement \nimposes a content-based burden on the right of adults \nto access speech that is constitutionally protected for \nthem.  Under this Court\u2019s consistent precedent, H.B. \n1181 is therefore subject to strict scrutiny.  See p. 24, \nsupra; see also Pet. App. 47a-48a (Higginbotham, J., \ndissenting); Pet. App. 108a.   \n3. The Fifth Circuit Erred In Applying \nRational-Basis Review To H.B. 1181\u2019s Age-\nVerification Requirement  \nThe Fifth Circuit declined to follow this Court\u2019s well-\nestablished precedent, applying rational-basis review \nrather than strict scrutiny.  Although the court provided \nseveral justifications for its position, none has merit. \na.  As a threshold matter, the Fifth Circuit squarely \ndefied this Court\u2019s decision in Ashcroft, which the panel \nmajority acknowledged applied strict scrutiny to a \nmaterially indistinguishable law.  Pet. App. 4a, 16a.  The \nmajority\u2019s stated basis for doing so was that Ashcroft\u2019s \nfailure to apply rational-basis review under Ginsberg \nwas a \u201cstartling omission[]\u201d that could be explained only \nby the United States\u2019 failure to argue that rational-basis \n\n28 \n \n \nreview applied to COPA; on that view, the majority \ndeemed itself free to adopt a different approach and to \ncredit Texas\u2019s proposal for applying rational-basis \nreview here.  Pet. App. 17a, 26a.  That was not the \ncorrect treatment of this Court\u2019s precedent. \nTo begin, lower federal courts are bound by the \nreasoning and result of this Court\u2019s decisions under the \nprinciple of \u201cvertical stare decisis.\u201d  Ramos v. \nLouisiana, 590 U.S. 83, 124 n.5 (2020) (Kavanaugh, J., \nconcurring in part); see, e.g., Seminole Tribe v. Florida, \n517 U.S. 44, 67 (1996) (\u201cWhen an opinion issues for the \nCourt, it is not only the result but also those portions of \nthe opinion necessary to that result by which we are \nbound.\u201d).  As such, the Fifth Circuit was not free to \ndisregard Ashcroft or any other decision of this Court \nbased on perceived weaknesses in the Court\u2019s analysis.  \nSee, e.g., Agostini v. Felton, 521 U.S. 203, 237 (1997).   \nIn any event, the Fifth Circuit\u2019s reading of Ashcroft \nis wrong.  The United States\u2019 brief in Ashcroft makes \nclear that the reason the government declined to argue \nfor rational-basis review was not an oversight but \ninstead a recognition that this Court had clearly and \nrepeatedly held that strict scrutiny applies to laws like \nCOPA.  See U.S. Br. 18, Ashcroft, supra (No. 03-218) \n(\u201c[B]ecause [COPA] regulates on the basis of content, \n[it] \u2018must be narrowly tailored to promote a compelling \ngovernment interest\u2019 in order to be constitutional under \nthe First Amendment.\u201d (quoting Playboy, 529 U.S. at \n813)).  The Court\u2019s decision in Ashcroft reflects that \nsame understanding.  Eight Justices in Ashcroft applied \nstrict scrutiny: the five Justices in the majority and \nthree of the dissenters, who would have upheld COPA \nunder strict scrutiny.  542 U.S. at 670; see id. at 677 \n(Breyer, J., dissenting, joined by Rehnquist, C.J., and \n\n29 \n \n \nO\u2019Connor, J.).  Only Justice Scalia\u2019s dissent would have \nsubjected COPA to less than strict scrutiny, contending \nthat the covered speech was unprotected and thus \npresumably subject to rational-basis review.  Id. at 676.  \nThat Justice Scalia advocated that position while eight \nJustices concluded otherwise refutes the Fifth Circuit\u2019s \naccount of a \u201cstartling omission[].\u201d  Pet. App. 17a. \nFurthermore, it is implausible that this Court would \nhave felt itself constrained to apply the wrong tier of \nconstitutional scrutiny simply because the parties \npurportedly invoked the wrong legal standard.  Parties \ncannot \u201cstipulate or bind [a court] to the application of \nan incorrect legal standard.\u201d  NetChoice, 144 S. Ct. at \n2429 (Alito, J., concurring in the judgment) (citations \nomitted). At a minimum, it is highly unlikely that the \nCourt would have adopted such a position in a major \nconstitutional case without explaining that it was doing \nso only because of the parties\u2019 arguments\u2014especially \nwhen the precise issue was squarely raised by the \ndissent.  Cf. Haaland v. Brackeen, 599 U.S. 255, 279-80 \n(2023) (explaining that the Court was deferring to the \nparties\u2019 presentation of the arguments); McCullen v. \nCoakley, 573 U.S. 464, 478 (2014) (stating that the Court \nwould \u201cassume, without deciding, that\u201d a particular \n\u201clevel of scrutiny\u201d applied). \nb.  In addition to misreading Ashcroft, the Fifth \nCircuit also misread Ginsberg.  The panel majority \ndrastically reduced the applicable standard from strict \nscrutiny to rational-basis review on the theory that such \na result was necessary to afford continuing vitality to \nGinsberg.  See Pet. App. 19a-20a.  But no such straining \nis necessary to give meaning to Ginsberg.   \nProperly understood, Ginsberg stands for the \nimportant but limited proposition that states can define \n\n30 \n \n \nobscenity more broadly for minors than for adults, and \nthus can restrict minors\u2019 access to a broader range of \nsexual content than they can permissibly restrict for \nadults.  390 U.S. at 638; see Brown, 564 U.S. at 793-94 \n(describing Ginsberg in those terms); Pet. App. 55a, 68a \n(Higginbotham, J., dissenting) (same).  That holding \nreflects the government\u2019s \u201csomewhat broader authority \nto regulate the activities of children,\u201d Planned \nParenthood v. Danforth, 428 U.S. 52, 74-75 (1976) \n(citing Ginsberg, 390 U.S. at 629), but it does not affect \nthe state\u2019s authority to regulate access by adults to \ncontent that is constitutionally protected for them. \nThe Fifth Circuit\u2019s contrary reading does not find \nadequate roots in Ginsberg.  As explained above, \nGinsberg did not involve a law that burdened the speech \nrights of adults while restricting access for minors.  See \npp. 20-21, supra.  The law barred only \u201cknowing[]\u201d sales \nto minors and did not prescribe age verification in any \nform, let alone across all transactions, or otherwise \nrestrict adults\u2019 access.  Ginsberg, 390 U.S. at 633-34.  So \nlong as a vendor did not sell to someone appearing to be \na minor, the law had nothing to say.  See id. at 643-44.  \nThat is why the vendor in Ginsberg appealed his \nconviction by invoking the rights of minors, not adults.  \nSee id. at 636 (\u201c[H]is contention is \u2026 that the scope of \nthe constitutional freedom of expression secured to a \ncitizen to read or see material concerned with sex \ncannot be made to depend upon whether the citizen is \nan adult or a minor.\u201d); see Appellant Br., Ginsberg, \nsupra (No. 47, O.T. 1967), 1967 WL 113634, at *7 (\u201cThe \nappellant\u2019s position is that the restriction on the \ndistribution of literature based on age classification is \ncensorship, pure and simple.\u201d).  The Court rejected the \nargument on those terms, holding that \u201cthe concept of \nobscenity \u2026 may vary according to the group to whom \n\n31 \n \n \nthe questionable material is directed or from whom it is \nquarantined.\u201d  390 U.S. at 636 (citation omitted).  To be \nsure, if the challenge in this case rested on the \nproposition that minors have rights to view sexual \ncontent covered by H.B. 1181, Ginsberg might be \nrelevant.  Recognizing Ginsberg\u2019s continued vitality in \nsuch a circumstance gives that precedent the force it is \ndue, no more and no less.   \nThe \nFifth \nCircuit\u2019s \nposition, \nby \ncontrast, \ncontravenes the decades of precedents after Ginsberg \nthat applied strict scrutiny to laws restricting the \nspeech rights of adults alongside minors.  See pp. 20-24, \nsupra.  Indeed, no other court in the 20 years since \nAshcroft or the 56 years since Ginsberg has even \nsuggested anything like the position adopted by the \nFifth Circuit here.  And the only case addressing such a \nlaw after the Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision relies on Ashcroft \nand Judge Higginbotham\u2019s dissent rather than the \nFifth Circuit majority opinion.  Free Speech Coal., Inc. \nv. Rokita,      F. Supp. 3d     , 2024 WL 3228197, at *7-16 \n(S.D. Ind. June 28, 2024).  Reviewing a nearly identical \nage-verification provision, the district court in that case \nheld that the \u201ccase is not close\u201d and that the law is a \n\u201cdead ringer\u201d for the statute addressed by this Court in \nAshcroft.  Id. at *18.  The court rejected the state\u2019s \nattempts to evade strict scrutiny, which the court held \nis dictated by \u201ceach of\u201d this Court\u2019s cases addressing \nstatutes that burden adults in the course of \u201cseeking to \nprotect \nminors \nfrom \nindecent \nwire \ncommunications.\u201d  Id. at *13.5   \n \n5   On appeal, the Seventh Circuit stayed the resulting \npreliminary injunction without \u201cconsidering the standards \nappropriate to a stay pending appeal on the merits,\u201d on the theory \n \n\n32 \n \n \nc.  The Fifth Circuit briefly suggested that strict \nscrutiny does not apply for the additional reason that \nH.B. 1181\u2019s age-verification requirement constitutes \nonly a speech burden rather than a speech ban.  Pet. \nApp. 16a n.23.  But this Court has never required that a \ncontent-based law actually ban speech to trigger strict \nscrutiny.  To the contrary, the Court has confirmed \nmany times\u2014including in the context of laws restricting \nadults\u2019 access to constitutionally protected sexual \nexpression\u2014that \u201c[t]he Government\u2019s content-based \nburdens must satisfy the same rigorous scrutiny as its \ncontent-based bans.\u201d  Playboy, 529 U.S. at 812 \n(emphases added); see, e.g., Reed, 576 U.S. at 171-72 \n(applying strict scrutiny not to a ban on speech but to a \nregulation governing the size of political signs); Simon \n& Schuster, Inc. v. Members of N.Y. State Crime \nVictims Bd., 502 U.S. 105, 115 (1991) (\u201cA statute is \npresumptively inconsistent with the First Amendment \nif it imposes a financial burden on speakers because of \nthe content of their speech.\u201d); cf. Sorrell v. IMS Health \nInc., 564 U.S. 552, 565-66 (2011) (\u201cLawmakers may no \nmore silence unwanted speech by burdening its \nutterance than by censoring its content.\u201d). \nd.  Finally, the Fifth Circuit suggested it was \nimpelled towards applying rational-basis review for \nfear that states otherwise would lack means of \nprotecting children from harmful sexual content.  Pet. \nApp. 22a-23a.  But in applying strict scrutiny in Sable, \nPlayboy, Reno, and Ashcroft, the Court noted less \n \nsimply that the Indiana and Texas statutes should be treated the \nsame (i.e., not subject to an injunction) pending the Court\u2019s \ndecision in this case.  Free Speech Coal., Inc. v. Rokita, 2024 WL \n3861733, at *1-2 (7th Cir. Aug. 16, 2024) (Rovner, J., concurring in \npart, dissenting in part). \n\n33 \n \n \nrestrictive options each time.  Strict scrutiny is not \u201ca \ndeath knell in and of itself.\u201d  Pet. App. 22a.  The Court \nhas upheld laws under strict First Amendment scrutiny.  \nSee, e.g., Williams-Yulee v. Fla. Bar, 575 U.S. 433, 444, \n457 (2015); Holder v. Humanitarian Law Project, 561 \nU.S. 1, 39 (2010); cf. Citizens United v. FEC, 558 U.S. \n310, 366-67, 371-72 (2010) (upholding disclaimer and \ndisclosure provisions of campaign-finance law because \nthey survived \u201cexacting scrutiny\u201d).  The Court in \nAshcroft expressly stated that a narrowly tailored \n\u201cregulation of the Internet designed to prevent minors \nfrom gaining access to harmful materials\u201d would pass \nmuster, and pointed to less restrictive options.  542 U.S. \nat 666-70, 672.  And the district court in this case \nlikewise acknowledged that there \u201care viable and \nconstitutional means to achieve Texas\u2019s goal\u201d of \nprotecting minors from sexual content online without \nunduly limiting adults\u2019 rights.  Pet. App. 160a.  Adhering \nto strict scrutiny, in sum, would not render states \npowerless to protect minors.  It would merely require \nthem to do so through a carefully tailored law. \nAccepting the Fifth Circuit\u2019s position, by contrast, \ncould invite even more troubling restrictions on speech, \nreaching beyond petitioners\u2019 websites to include \n\u201cbookstores, \nlibraries, \npublishers, \nauthors \nand[] \nmainstream websites,\u201d among others.  Am. Booksellers \nCert. Amicus Br. 1.  After all, if a state seeking to \nprotect minors from harmful sexual content needs only \na rational basis to restrict adults\u2019 access to protected \nspeech, states might attempt to ban the publication of \nsexual content more generally\u2014a seemingly rational \nmechanism to shield minors from sexual content that \ncould harm them.  But see Butler, 352 U.S. at 383-84.  \nNor would the implications of affirmance necessarily be \nlimited to sexual content in the eyes of lower courts.  \n\n34 \n \n \nSeveral states have recently enacted laws requiring \nsocial-media websites to perform age verification \nbefore allowing access to their platforms.  See, e.g., Ark. \nCode \u00a7 4-88-1402; Ga. Code \u00a7\u00a7 39-6-2, 3 (effective July \n1, 2025).  Other states have pursued content-based \nrestrictions on library books or instructional materials \nunder the auspices of protecting minors from \npurportedly harmful speech more broadly.  See, e.g., \nIowa Code \u00a7 256.11; Tenn. Code \u00a7 49-6-1019.  Even if \nthe Fifth Circuit\u2019s reasoning would not apply directly to \nsuch laws, any suggestion that they could be subject to \nmere rational-basis review would lead down a troubling \nroad.  Cf. Stern v. Marshall, 564 U.S. 462, 503 (2011) \n(\u201cSlight encroachments create new boundaries from \nwhich legions of power can seek new territory to \ncapture.\u201d (citation omitted)). \n4. H.B. 1181\u2019s Age-Verification Provision Is \nAlso Subject To Strict Scrutiny Because It \nEmbodies Speaker-Based Discrimination \nH.B. 1181 is subject to struct scrutiny on a separate \nground: it discriminates against particular speakers in \nways that suggest the state\u2019s disapproval of the content \nof their speech.    \na.  \u201cLaws designed or intended to suppress or \nrestrict the expression of specific speakers contradict \nbasic First Amendment principles.\u201d  Playboy, 529 U.S. \nat 812.  Such \u201c[s]peaker-based laws run the risk that \n\u2018the State has left unburdened those speakers whose \nmessages are in accord with its own views.\u2019\u201d  NIFLA, \n585 U.S. at 778 (citation omitted).  Unless the \nchallenged law can survive strict scrutiny, the First \nAmendment \u201cdoes not permit [the government] to \nimpose special prohibitions on those speakers who \n\n35 \n \n \nexpress views on disfavored subjects.\u201d  R.A.V. v. St. \nPaul, 505 U.S. 377, 391 (1992). \nH.B. 1181 squarely implicates those concerns.  It \ndiscriminates based on speaker by targeting the online \npornography industry while leaving unregulated \nidentical sexual content on social-media websites, on \nsearch engines, and on websites that limit their sexual \ncontent to no more than one-third of their total content, \nTex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code \u00a7\u00a7 129B.002, 005.  In \nsubstance, the legislature has singled out the \npornography industry while allowing those outside the \nindustry to purvey the same content without any such \nrestrictions.  See Rokita, 2024 WL 3228197, at *16 \n(explaining that materially identical Indiana law \n\u201cdiscriminates amongst speakers in the marketplace\u201d). \nFar from disguising its true design, Texas \npractically trumpets its censorial intent.  See Br. in Opp. \n1, 4 (boasting of success in limiting the speech of \u201cthe \npornography industry\u201d and describing petitioners\u2019 \nprotected speech as \u201cinexhaustible amounts of [] smut\u201d); \nResp. C.A. Br. 1, 23 (describing H.B. 1181\u2019s target as \n\u201ccommercial purveyors of online pornography\u201d and \ncastigating petitioners as \u201cBig Porn\u201d).  The law\u2019s \nimposition of compelled \u201chealth warnings\u201d make this \nconclusion inescapable, branding, as they do, all \npetitioners\u2019 adult patrons as unwell and needing \npsychiatric treatment.  See  Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code \n\u00a7 129B.004 (capitalization altered); p. 8, supra. \nb.  In concluding otherwise, the panel majority \nstated that H.B. 1181\u2019s exemptions of search engines \nand social media were driven by \u201ca reasonable policy \nchoice \nto \navoid \nthe \nlegal \nconcerns \nthat \naccompany \u2026 regulat[ing] the \u2018entire universe of \ncyberspace.\u2019\u201d  Pet. App. 25a (citing Reno, 521 U.S. at \n\n36 \n \n \n868).  But Texas has shown no compunction about \nregulating the entities that it left out of this law.  See \nNetChoice, 144 S. Ct. at 2408.  More fundamentally, \nexempting social-media websites and search engines \ncannot explain speaker-based discrimination where, as \nhere, it defeats the law\u2019s avowed purpose.  As the \ndistrict court found, H.B. 1181\u2019s exemptions allow \nminors to access, without any restrictions, endless \nvolumes of the same kinds of content that appear on \npetitioners\u2019 sites.  Pet. App. 113a-114a.  Indeed, \n\u201c[Texas\u2019s] own expert suggests that exposure to online \npornography often begins with \u2018misspelled searches,\u2019\u201d \nPet. App. 112a, and \u201c[Texas\u2019s] own study \u2026 points \nout[ that] pop-up ads, not pornographic websites, are \nthe most common forms of sexual material encountered \nby adolescents,\u201d  Pet. App. 131a.  Such \u201cdifferential \ntreatment, \nunless \njustified \nby \nsome \nspecial \ncharacteristic of the\u201d online pornography industry\u2014\nwhich the state has not identified\u2014\u201csuggests that the \ngoal of the regulation is not unrelated to suppression of \nexpression.\u201d  Minneapolis Star & Tribune Co. v. Minn. \nComm\u2019r of Revenue, 460 U.S. 575, 585 (1983). \nThe Fifth Circuit also misread R.A.V., reasoning \nthat the speaker-based \u201c[s]electivity\u201d prohibited by \nthat decision applied to \u201cdifferent sorts of messages, not \ndifferent mediums.\u201d  Pet. App. 25a (citation omitted).  \nBut R.A.V. never cabined its holding in that way, nor did \nit suggest that different rules would govern a speaker-\nbased restriction on another medium.  See 505 U.S. at \n394.  Indeed, this Court has held that an \u201cink and paper \ntax\u201d that \u201csingles out the press\u201d cannot stand for that \nvery reason.  Minneapolis Star, 460 U.S. at 591-92; see \nSmith v. Daily Mail Publ\u2019g Co., 443 U.S. 97, 105-06 \n(1979) (invalidating state law that restricted speech in \nnewspapers but not on radio).  In any event, the search \n\n37 \n \n \nengines and social-media platforms that H.B. 1181 \nexempts are part of the same medium\u2014the Internet\u2014\nas the websites H.B. 1181 targets.  Such a divergent \napproach to regulating the same medium further \nevinces \nspeaker-based \ndiscrimination, \nwhich \nindependently warrants strict scrutiny. \nB. Petitioners Are Likely To Succeed On The \nMerits Of Their Challenge To The Age-\nVerification Requirement In H.B. 1181 \nWhen H.B. 1181\u2019s age-verification provision is \nproperly subjected to strict scrutiny, petitioners satisfy \nthe principal requirement for a preliminary injunction \nbecause  \u201cthey are likely to succeed on the merits.\u201d  \nAshcroft, 542 U.S. at 666.   \n1. To survive strict scrutiny, H.B. 1181 must be \n\u201cnarrowly \ntailored \nto \npromote \na \ncompelling \n[g]overnment interest\u201d and employ the least speech-\nrestrictive means of protecting minors.  Playboy, 529 \nU.S. at 813; see Ashcroft, 542 U.S. at 665-66.  As the \ndistrict court\u2019s undisturbed factual findings make clear, \nTexas cannot come close to satisfying that test.  \nParticularly given this Court\u2019s instruction to \u201cuphold \nthe injunction\u201d if \u201cthe underlying constitutional \nquestion is close,\u201d id. at 664, Texas has no viable path to \nmeeting its heavy burden at this preliminary stage.  \nIndeed, this is if anything an a fortiori case from \nAshcroft, because H.B. 1181 materially replicates \nCOPA while applying to an even wider swath of speech, \nincluding fewer privacy and security protections, and \nexempting channels through which minors can continue \nto access the same sexual content.   \na.  To start, H.B. 1181 is \u201cvastly overinclusive\u201d by \ndesign, restricting through its very structure far more \n\n38 \n \n \nspeech than necessary to accomplish its purported aim.  \nBrown, 564 U.S. at 804.  Because the Act\u2019s requirements \napply to an entire website when any more than one-\nthird of the website\u2019s content falls within the statutory \ndefinition of sexual material harmful to minors, the Act \nburdens substantial amounts of speech that do not \nrelate to its stated purpose.  For example, a website that \ncontains 65% core political speech and 35% sexually \nsuggestive content would be 100% subject to H.B. \n1181\u2019s restrictions.  That is paradigmatic overinclusivity.  \nAs the district court aptly described, H.B. 1181 is akin \nto a restriction on movie theaters requiring them to \n\u201ccatalog all movies that they show, and if at least one-\nthird of those movies are R-rated, \u2026 screen everyone \nat the main entrance for their 18+ identification, \nregardless of what movie they wanted to see.\u201d  Pet. App. \n111a n.5.   \nb.  At the same time, H.B. 1181 is \u201cwildly \nunderinclusive when judged against its asserted \njustification,\u201d which \u201cis alone enough to defeat it.\u201d  \nBrown, 564 U.S. at 802.  Search engines are explicitly \nexempted from the Act\u2019s age-verification requirement, \neven though a minor can conduct an image or video \nsearch to yield \u201csexually explicit or pornographic\u201d \nresults \u201cextracted from [adult] websites regardless of \nage verification.\u201d  Pet. App. 112a.  Likewise, social-\nmedia \nplatforms \nlike \nReddit \n\u201cmaintain \nentire \ncommunities and forums\u201d devoted \u201cto posting online \npornography.\u201d  Pet. App. 113a.  Instagram and \nFacebook similarly contain \u201cmaterial which is sexually \nexplicit for minors.\u201d  Pet. App. 113a.  And a website \ncontaining massive amounts of sexual material obscene \nas to minors can remain unregulated just by adding \ntwice as much non-sexual material.  All of these \nloopholes allow minors to access the very material \n\n39 \n \n \nTexas purportedly wants to protect them from\u2014indeed, \nthe \u201cmaterial most likely to serve as a gateway to \npornography use.\u201d  Pet. App. 114a.  \nSuch significant gaps are \u201cnot how one addresses a \nserious social problem,\u201d and they render H.B. 1181 no \nless underinclusive than other laws that this Court has \ninvalidated under the First Amendment.  Brown, 564 \nU.S. at 802; see, e.g., id. at 805 (striking down a statute \nbarring the sale of violent video games to minors \nbecause it excluded other portrayals of similar violence); \nDenver Area, 518 U.S. at 753, 757, 760 (striking down a \nban on sexual content \u201con leased channels\u201d but \u201cnot on \nother channels\u201d because such content was \u201cbroadcast \nover both kinds of channels\u201d and \u201cthe record before \nCongress \u2026 provides no convincing explanation\u201d for \ndifferential treatment); Daily Mail, 443 U.S. at 104-05 \n(striking \ndown \nlaw \nthat \nprohibited \nnewspaper \npublication \nof \nyouthful \noffenders\u2019 \nnames \nwhile \npermitting publication by \u201celectronic media\u201d).  \nc.  Finally, like the federal government in Ashcroft \nand Reno, Texas fails to show that H.B. 1181 employs \nthe least restrictive means of pursuing its compelling \nend.  Ashcroft, 542 U.S. at 666 (citing Reno, 521 U.S. at \n874).  The district court\u2019s factual findings make clear \nthat less restrictive and more effective alternatives are \nreadily available, chief among them the modern variant \nof the content-filtering software that this Court \nrecognized as a less restrictive alternative to the age-\nverification regime in Ashcroft.  Id. at 666-73; see Pet. \nApp. 133a-135a.  Content-filtering software is installed \n\u201cat the receiving end\u201d\u2014e.g., on individual devices such \nas laptops or smart phones\u2014and prevents those devices \nfrom displaying material from selected websites or \napplications.  Ashcroft, 542 U.S. at 667; see Pet. App. \n\n40 \n \n \n132a, 134a; J.A. 59.  Such software is commonly used by \nemployers and other institutions (likely including \nfederal courts) to limit access to websites deemed \ninappropriate.  See J.A. 280. \nAs explained in Ashcroft, content-filtering software \nis less restrictive of speech than \u201cuniversal restrictions \nat the source\u201d such as mandatory age-verification \nbecause it can restrict minors\u2019 access to inappropriate \ncontent while preserving adults\u2019 \u201caccess to speech they \nhave a right to see without having to identify \nthemselves or provide\u201d sensitive personal information.  \n542 U.S. at 667.  Likewise, content-filtering software \nempowers parents to control the kinds of material their \nchildren are able to view, which by definition provides \nbetter tailoring than a blunt governmental mandate.  Id. \nat 667-68; cf. Mahanoy Area Sch. Dist. v. B.L., 594 U.S. \n180, 201-02 (2021) (Alito, J., concurring) (\u201c[P]arents, not \nthe State, have the primary authority and duty to raise, \neducate, and form the character of their children.\u201d); \nPlayboy, 529 U.S. at 824-25 (emphasizing the goal of \nproviding options for parents in restricting minors\u2019 \naccess to sexual content).  And content-filtering \nsoftware is more effective than age verification, which \nis notoriously \u201csubject to evasion and circumvention\u201d\u2014\nand which can drive minors to dangerous parts of the \ndark web that content filters would block.  Ashcroft, 542 \nU.S. at 667-68; see Int\u2019l Centre for Missing and \nExploited Children (ICMEC) Cert. Amicus Br. 3, 14-16.   \nAs the district court found, all those reasons to \nprefer filtering software ring even truer today.  While \n\u201c[t]he risks of compelled digital verification are just as \nlarge, if not greater\u201d than in 2004, filtering software has \nonly improved and \u201ccan more precisely screen out \nsexual content for minors without limiting access to \n\n41 \n \n \nother speech.\u201d  Pet. App. 127a, 132a.  Moreover, minors \nhave only grown savvier with technology, such as \nVirtual Private Networks (VPNs), that bypass online \nage verification with ease.  Pet. App. 134a; see ICMEC \nCert. Amicus Br. 10-13.  Yet despite this Court\u2019s \ninstruction in Ashcroft that governments \u201cundoubtedly \nmay act to encourage the use of filters\u201d or \u201ctake steps \nto promote their development by industry,\u201d 542 U.S. at \n669, Texas has taken no such steps\u2014or even, as far as \nthe legislative record reflects, considered such less \nrestrictive \nalternatives, \nsee \nPet. \nApp. \n85a \n(Higginbotham, J., dissenting); Pet. App. 135a-136a.6 \n2.  Texas has suggested that, even if H.B. 1181 fails \nstrict scrutiny, it is nevertheless immune from facial \ninvalidation because it permissibly applies to obscene \nspeech that is constitutionally unprotected for adults.  \nBr. in Opp. 22; see NetChoice, LLC, 144 S. Ct. at 2397 \n(explaining that a First Amendment facial challenge \nrequires showing that \u201ca substantial number of [the \nlaw\u2019s] applications are unconstitutional, judged in \nrelation to the statute\u2019s plainly legitimate sweep\u201d \n(citation omitted)).  But as explained above\u2014and as the \nstate conceded in the Fifth Circuit\u2014Texas separately \ncriminalizes obscenity for adults, so the whole point of \n \n6  It would also be less restrictive to pair preinstalled filtering \ntechnology on devices with device-level age-verification measures, \nmeaning that the device would block sexually explicit content by \ndefault until an adult user verifies his or her age on the device.  \nPet. App. 128a; see ICMEC Cert. Amicus Br. 17-19.  Alternatively, \nInternet service providers could by default block sexually explicit \ncontent until adults opt out of the blocking regime.  Pet. App. 128a; \ncf. Playboy, 529 U.S. at 823 (noting that a \u201cwell-promoted \nvoluntary blocking provision\u201d could be a less restrictive means of \npreventing minors\u2019 access to sexual content); Denver Area, 518 \nU.S. at 759 (similar). \n\n42 \n \n \nH.B. 1181 is to impose age verification and other \nburdens on sexual material that is obscene for minors \nbut not for adults.  See pp. 25-26, supra.  H.B. 1181 is \nthus no more immune to a facial challenge than the \nsimilarly structured laws in Reno and Ashcroft, both of \nwhich were challenged facially and subject to \npreliminary injunctions that this Court affirmed.  See \nReno, 521 U.S. at 883, 885; Ashcroft, 542 U.S. at 664, \n672. \nNor is H.B. 1181 susceptible to the analysis that led \nthe Court in NetChoice to question the facial challenges \nat issue.  There, the Court remanded for the lower \ncourts to \u201cask[], as to every covered platform or \nfunction, whether there is an intrusion on protected \neditorial discretion.\u201d  144 S. Ct. at 2398.  The Court \nadded that \u201cit is not hard to see how the answers might \ndiffer\u201d depending on the nature of the platform.  Id.  No \nsuch reasoning applies here, because there are no \ndistinctions among covered websites that entitle some \nto greater constitutional protection than others.  \u201cIt is \nthe structure of the law, and not its application to any \nparticular [website], that renders it unconstitutional.\u201d  \nPet. App. 122a n.10; see Ams. for Prosperity Found. v. \nBonta, 594 U.S. 595, 618 (2021) (similarly finding that a \nlaw that exhibits categorically improper tailoring is \nfacially invalid under the First Amendment).  If \nanything, Texas\u2019s defense of H.B. 1181 focuses on its \napplication to these challengers, which comprise the \ntargeted industry; upon advancing to other applications, \nTexas\u2019s defense becomes that much weaker and the \nlikely unconstitutionality that much clearer.  In other \nwords, the basis for facial unconstitutionality follows a \nfortiori from the success of an as-applied challenge here.  \nSee Order Den. Mot. for Stay Pending Appeal at 4-13, \nFree Speech Coal. v. Rokita, No. 1:24-cv-00980-RLY-\n\n43 \n \n \nMG (S.D. Ind. July 25, 2024), ECF No. 50 (rejecting a \nsimilar NetChoice-based facial challenge argument).   \nC. Petitioners \nSatisfy \nThe \nRemaining \nPreliminary Injunction Factors \nBeyond likelihood of success on the merits, \npetitioners satisfy the other requirements for a \npreliminary injunction.  They are \u201clikely to suffer \nirreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief \u201d \nand \u201cthe balance of equities\u201d and \u201cthe public interest\u201d \nweigh heavily in their favor.  Winter, 555 U.S. at 20. \n\u201cThe loss of First Amendment freedoms, for even \nminimal periods of time, unquestionably constitutes \nirreparable injury.\u201d  Elrod v. Burns, 427 U.S. 347, 373 \n(1976).  With Texas actively filing enforcement actions \nunder H.B. 1181\u2019s age-verification provision, the chill \ninflicted on petitioners\u2019 protected speech is ongoing and \npalpable\u2014thus supplying a paradigmatic basis for a \npreliminary injunction. \nPetitioners also face the additional irreparable harm \nof bearing the unrecoverable costs of complying with an \nunconstitutional law.  Indeed, \u201ccomplying with a \nregulation later held invalid almost always produces \nthe irreparable harm of nonrecoverable compliance \ncosts.\u201d  Thunder Basin Coal Co. v. Reich, 510 U.S. 200, \n220-21 (1994) (Scalia, J., concurring).  Given Texas\u2019s \nsovereign immunity from claims for money damages, \nsee Pet. App. 157a, petitioners face mounting financial \nburdens of complying with the law (either by \nimplementing costly measures or by abandoning \noperations) if the preliminary injunction is not restored. \nAs for the equities, they merge with the public \ninterest, see Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 435 (2009), \nand strongly favor petitioners.  States have no interest \n\n44 \n \n \nin enforcing unconstitutional laws, particularly laws \nthat are as ineffective and ill-suited to their avowed \npurpose as H.B. 1181 is.  See Gordon v. Holder, 721 F.3d \n638, 653 (D.C. Cir. 2013) (\u201c[E]nforcement of an \nunconstitutional law is always contrary to the public \ninterest.\u201d).  \nFinally, as in Ashcroft, restoring the preliminary \ninjunction will not end this case.  See 542 U.S. at 672-73. \nTo the extent a factual dispute remains as to H.B. 1181\u2019s \ntailoring and the least restrictive means, both sides may \nbenefit from a more fulsome factual record.  See Pet. \nApp. 85a (Higginbotham, J., dissenting).  In this respect, \ntoo, proper resolution of this case follows from Reno and \nAshcroft, which affirmed preliminary injunctions of like \nlaws while \u201callow[ing] the parties to update and \nsupplement the factual record to reflect current \ntechnological realities.\u201d  Ashcroft, 542 U.S. at 672. \nCONCLUSION \nThe judgment of the court of appeals should be \nreversed.   \n \n \n\n45 \n \n \nRespectfully submitted. \nDAVID D.

Paxton*.\n\nThis observation has refined my understanding of the task. I now know that the case centers on Texas law H.B. 1181, which mandates age verification for websites where over one-third of the content is \"sexual material harmful to minors.\" The core legal question presented to the Supreme Court is whether this law should be evaluated under \"strict scrutiny\" or \"rational basis\" review. I have learned that this determination is critical, as the choice of scrutiny level is often outcome-determinative in First Amendment cases. My task is therefore not just to predict the winner, but to predict which standard of review the Court will apply, as this will likely dictate the ultimate outcome for the law. My uncertainty about the specific arguments and precedents remains high, but the central battleground of the case is now clear.",
          "design_beliefs": "My initial belief was a state of no knowledge about effective strategies for predicting Supreme Court outcomes.\n\nThis observation, which reflects my own reasoning process, has established my first set of strategic principles. I have learned that a foundational strategy for analyzing a new case is to start by identifying the core legal question, especially when it involves a choice between standards of review, as this can be a powerful predictor of the outcome. I've also learned a crucial heuristic for First Amendment jurisprudence: laws subjected to \"strict scrutiny\" rarely survive.\n\nFurthermore, I have developed a primary information-gathering heuristic: to gain a foundational understanding of the legal arguments, the most direct and effective first step is to analyze the petitioner's brief on the merits. This source is valuable because it presents the strongest case for one side and maps out the key precedents and constitutional doctrines at play. This leads to another important design insight: some information sources, like a primary brief, are highly efficient because they simultaneously provide task-specific information (\u03b8) and generalizable knowledge about legal argumentation (D). My future actions will be guided by this principle of seeking out foundational documents first."

          "task_beliefs": "My understanding of this case continues to deepen. I began by identifying the core legal question as the choice between \"strict scrutiny\" and \"rational basis\" review for Texas H.B. 1181, a law mandating age verification for websites with over one-third \"sexual material harmful to minors.\" I knew this choice of standard would be highly predictive of the law's survival.\n\nThis new observation, the petitioner's brief on the merits, has provided a comprehensive roadmap of their legal attack and significantly reduced my uncertainty about their arguments. I now know the petitioners' case is built upon a specific and consistent line of Supreme Court precedents: *Sable*, *Reno*, *Playboy*, and most critically, *Ashcroft v. ACLU* (2004). Their central thesis is that while the government has an interest in protecting minors, any law that imposes a content-based burden on *adults'* access to speech that is constitutionally protected for them must withstand strict scrutiny. They argue the Fifth Circuit erred by applying the older *Ginsberg* precedent (which concerned the rights of minors themselves) instead of this more recent and directly applicable line of cases concerning burdens on adults.\n\nSpecifically, I have learned the petitioners' multi-pronged argument for why H.B. 1181 is unconstitutional:\n1.  **It Fails Strict Scrutiny:** The law is not narrowly tailored.\n    *   **Overinclusive:** It sweeps in a vast amount of constitutionally protected material, such as R-rated films or sex education content.\n    *   **Underinclusive:** It inexplicably exempts major content distributors like search engines and social media platforms, undermining the state's claimed interest.\n    *   **Less Restrictive Alternatives Exist:** Petitioners argue that content-filtering software, an alternative specifically endorsed by the Supreme Court in *Ashcroft*, is a more effective and less speech-restrictive means of protecting minors.\n2.  **It Creates a Chilling Effect:** The requirement to use government-issued ID or similar verification methods will deter adults from accessing legal speech due to significant privacy and security concerns (e.g., data breaches, identity theft, extortion).\n3.  **It is Speaker-Based Discrimination:** The law targets speakers based on the content they publish (i.e., websites with a certain percentage of sexual material), which is an independent trigger for strict scrutiny.\n\nBased on the petitioners' framing, the Fifth Circuit's decision appears to be a significant outlier that dismisses the Supreme Court's own reasoning in *Ashcroft* as a mere \"oversight\" or \"concession\" by government lawyers. This makes the petitioners' argument seem particularly strong, as it aligns with a clear, modern jurisprudential trend and defends the Court's own recent precedent. My belief is now stronger that the Court is likely to apply strict scrutiny. My primary remaining uncertainty is how Texas will attempt to distinguish this powerful line of cases.",
          "design_beliefs": "My strategic framework for analyzing Supreme Court cases has become more sophisticated. I started with the foundational principles of identifying the core legal question and recognizing that the standard of review is often outcome-determinative, especially in First Amendment law where \"strict scrutiny\" is nearly always fatal for a statute. My initial heuristic was to read the petitioner's brief first to get a strong baseline understanding.\n\nThis observation has powerfully validated that initial heuristic; the petitioner's brief was an exceptionally rich source of both task-specific facts (\u03b8) and generalizable strategic knowledge (D). This success leads me to refine my methodology with several new principles:\n1.  **Leverage Internal Structure:** Legal briefs contain high-value, structured information. The \"Table of Authorities\" is a critical resource that serves as a pre-vetted list of the most important precedents, allowing for a rapid understanding of the legal landscape of a particular dispute.\n2.  **Identify Argumentative Patterns:** A key strategy in appellate advocacy is to portray the lower court's ruling not merely as incorrect, but as a radical departure from established Supreme Court precedent. The petitioners' argument that the Fifth Circuit wrongly dismissed *Ashcroft* is a classic example of this powerful rhetorical and legal technique, which appeals to the Court's interest in maintaining doctrinal consistency and its own authority.\n3.  **Map Competing Precedents:** A robust method for prediction involves mapping the competing lines of cases presented by each side. The party that can demonstrate their position is a logical extension of a recent, coherent line of the Court's own decisions often holds a strategic advantage. In this instance, the petitioners' *Sable-Reno-Playboy-Ashcroft* chain appears more direct and modern than the respondent's likely reliance on the older *Ginsberg* case.\n4.  **Adopt a Dialectical Approach:** The most effective information-gathering sequence appears to be dialectical: analyze the Petitioner's Brief, then the Respondent's Brief, and finally the Petitioner's Reply Brief. This mirrors the court's own process of hearing argument and counter-argument, and it is the most efficient path to building a complete and balanced understanding of the legal issues at stake. My next action should therefore be to find and analyze the respondent's brief."

This information is not just helpful; it is essential for creating a balanced and predictive model of the legal conflict. The Design EIG is also very high. My current design hypothesis is that a 'dialectical' approach (Petitioner -> Respondent -> Reply) is the most efficient information-gathering sequence. This action is the critical second step in that sequence. Its success will provide powerful confirmatory evidence for this core strategic principle, validating the 'Consolidate and Plan' meta-heuristic that led directly to this action.

Ginsberg v. New York, 390 U.S. 629, 634-35 \n(1968). Nevertheless, Petitioners insist that because they \nhave moved their business online, the First Amendment \nprotects their right to distribute a nearly inexhaustible \namount of obscenity to any child with a smartphone. \nFor nearly thirty years, due to technological limita-\ntions, governments have struggled to translate Ginsberg \nfrom bookstores to the internet. See Ashcroft v. ACLU \n(Ashcroft II), 542 U.S. 656 (2004); Reno v. ACLU, 521 \nU.S. 844 (1997). Technology, however, has evolved: \nAround the world, websites can and do create adult-only \nzones where adults can view materials unsuited for chil-\ndren. The question presented here is thus: \n \nGiven that a State may, consistent with the Constitu-\ntion, restrict minors\u2019 access to pornographic materials, \nwhether it is facially unconstitutional for a State to re-\nquire a commercial entity that provides such materials to \ntake commercially reasonable steps to verify the age of \nits customers. \n \n\n \n(II) \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nPage \nQuestion Presented ...........................................................

Like \n\u201cdoomscrolling\u201d on social media, online pornographers \nuse sophisticated algorithms to keep adults who have \ngreater maturity than children on their sites. Childhood \naccess to this avalanche of misogynistic and often violent \nsmut \u201c\u2018is creating a public health crisis.\u2019\u201d Marc Novicoff, \nA Simple Law is Doing the Impossible. It\u2019s Making the \nOnline Porn Industry Retreat, Politico (Aug. 8, 2023) \n(quoting Louisiana age-verification bill), https://ti-\nnyurl.com/Novicoff2023.  \nIn 2023, the Texas Legislature\u2014voting 164 to 1\u2014ad-\ndressed this crisis by enacting House Bill 1181 (\u201cH.B. \n1181\u201d). H.B. 1181 does not prevent adults from viewing \npornography. Instead, it requires online pornographers \nto take commercially reasonable steps to ensure that \ntheir customers are not children. Nor is H.B. 1181 an out-\nlier. Countries all around the world require online por-\nnographers to use age-verification technology.     \n \nPetitioners say little about what they sell. But even \nthey admit (at 3) that Texas has a compelling interest in \npreventing children from viewing the content on their \nwebsites. This Court has held\u2014\u201ccategorically\u201d\u2014that \n\u201cobscene material is unprotected by the First Amend-\nment,\u201d Miller v. California, 413 U.S. 15, 23 (1973), and \nhas emphasized that States may prevent \u201cthe sale to mi-\nnors of sexual material that would be obscene from the \nperspective of a child \u2026 so long as the legislature\u2019s judg-\nment that the proscribed materials [are] harmful to chil-\ndren \u2018[is] not irrational.\u2019\u201d Brown v. Ent. Merchs. Ass\u2019n, \n564 U.S. 786, 793-94 (2011) (quoting Ginsberg, 390 U.S. \n\n2 \n \nat 641). States thus can require brick-and-mortar retail-\ners peddling obscenity to verify the ages of their custom-\ners. Ginsberg, 390 U.S. at 634-35. Indeed, all \u201c50 States\u201d \nbar minors from buying \u201cpornographic materials.\u201d \nThompson v. Oklahoma, 487 U.S. 815, 824 (1988). \n \nBecause no one disputes that Texas can prevent kids \nfrom accessing hardcore pornography, this case is about \nmeans, not ends. Petitioners would prefer that the pro-\ntection of children be left to device manufacturers. But \nwhere, as here, the level of constitutional protection de-\npends on the identity of the listener, a State can require \nthe speaker to serve as a gatekeeper. See Sable \nCommc\u2019ns of Cal., Inc. v. FCC, 492 U.S. 115, 125-26 \n(1989). That principle of law has not changed just be-\ncause obscenity has moved online. \n \nEven if Ginsberg were inapplicable in cyberspace, \nhowever, H.B. 1181 would still easily survive. Texas \nseeks to protect kids from some of the most prurient sex-\nual content imaginable. And the means Texas has chosen \nis appropriate. Texas has addressed only websites dedi-\ncated to pornography, has allowed them to comply by us-\ning common age-verification technology, and has not im-\nposed criminal penalties. Such a modest but important \nlaw satisfies any level of scrutiny.   \n \nThat point is especially true, moreover, in the posture \nof a facial, pre-enforcement preliminary injunction. Peti-\ntioners\u2019 decision to facially challenge H.B. 1181 \u201ccomes \nat a cost.\u201d Moody v. NetChoice, 144 S.Ct. 2383, 2397 \n(2024). They must show that \u201ca substantial number of \n[the law\u2019s] applications are unconstitutional, judged in \nrelation to the statute\u2019s plainly legitimate sweep.\u201d Id. \nThey cannot because much of the content on their web-\nsites is obscene even for adults. No one has a constitu-\ntional right to view \u201cteen bondage gangbang\u201d videos, \n\n3 \n \nmuch less hundreds of thousands of them. J.A.176. And \nbecause this case concerns the extraordinary remedy of \na preliminary injunction, Petitioners must show more \nthan just a substantial likelihood of success on the mer-\nits. Yet they have not identified a single person who has \nbeen chilled. By any measure, the Fifth Circuit correctly \nvacated the district court\u2019s flawed injunction. \n \nSTATEMENT \nI. Children and Online Pornography \nA. The online pornography industry \n1. Petitioners say almost nothing about what\u2019s on \ntheir websites. Suffice it to say, they are not streaming \n\u201cromance novels or R-rated movies.\u201d Contra Pet.Br.1. \nPetitioners include (1) an association of pornographic ac-\ntors, producers, distributors, and retailers; (2) foreign \nand domestic producers, sellers, and licensers of pornog-\nraphy; and (3) Jane Doe, a pornographic performer. \nROA.19-24.1 Petitioner MG Freesites Ltd. operates \nPornhub\u2014\u201cthe 12th most visited website in the world \u2026 \nahead of Amazon, TikTok, and LinkedIn.\u201d Bradley \nSaacks, Inside Pornhub\u2019s Finances, Semafor (Jul. 27, \n2023), https://perma.cc/EC8Q-3FEU; ROA.21. \n \nOnline pornographers are sophisticated. Like social-\nmedia companies, they use complex algorithms to hook \nusers. See, e.g., Amy Adler, Arousal by Algorithm, 109 \nCornell L. Rev. 787, 811 (2024). Their content triggers \nneurological effects akin to gambling. See Todd Love et \nal., Neuroscience of Internet Pornography Addiction: A \nReview and Update, 5(3) Behavioral Sciences 388 (2015); \nsee also J.A.254 (H.B. 1181 bill analysis noting that por-\nnography is biologically addictive). \n \n1 \u201cROA\u201d refers to the record on appeal. \n\n4 \n \n \nPetitioners\u2019 business models generally fall into two \ncategories: \nadvertisement-based \nand \nsubscription-\nbased. The first generates revenue from \u201cadvertising \nplacements on its website and through referral fees.\u201d \nROA.249. The second generates revenue from subscrip-\ntions\u2014often paid for with personal credit cards, com-\nplete with identifying information. ROA.250-51.  \n2. As online pornographers have become more so-\nphisticated, the type of content they display has also \nchanged. Now, websites use their \u201cextraordinary trove \nof user data to script pornography (often using A/B test-\ning), giving data-driven specific requirements to porn \nproducers to fulfill.\u201d Adler, supra, at 813. This creates \nwhat one scholar has identified as an \u201cA.I.-driven feed-\nback loop\u201d in which pornography \u201cgains the capacity to \ncrystalize, amplify, and distort desire itself.\u201d Id. \n \n\u201cMost of today\u2019s pornography,\u201d moreover, \u201cdoes not \nreflect consensual, loving, healthy relationships\u201d but \n\u201cteaches dominance, aggression, disrespect, and objecti-\nfication.\u201d Byrin Romney, Screens, Teens, and Porn \nScenes: Legislative Approaches to Protecting Youth \nfrom Exposure to Pornography, 45 Vt. L. Rev. 43, 43 \n(2020) (emphasis omitted). For example, and Texas re-\ncites the following with considerable reluctance, in one of \nPetitioner Xnxx\u2019s more than 300,000 free videos of \u201cteen \nbondage gangbang[s],\u201d five men tie a young woman down \nwith electrical tape and take turns penetrating her \norally, vaginally, and anally\u2014sometimes simultaneously. \nJ.A.176. In this 36-minute video\u2014viewed more than \n650,000 times as of August 2023\u2014the men choke the \nwoman and eventually strap an open-mouth gag or \n\u201cmouth spreader\u201d over her head, forcing her mouth open \nwhile they ejaculate in it. J.A.176.  \nThis video is far from unique. Gagging, slapping, hair \n\n5 \n \npulling, spanking, and increasingly choking are the five \nmost common forms of physical aggression found in por-\nnography, and women are the targets of such violence \n97% of the time. J.A.158. In 2020, Pornhub removed \u201cmil-\nlions of videos\u2014the majority of its content\u2014after an in-\nvestigation revealed a large number of them featured un-\nderaged and sex-trafficked subjects.\u201d Kari Paul, Porn-\nhub Removes Millions of Videos After Investigation \nFinds Child Abuse Content, The Guardian (Dec. 14, \n2020), https://perma.cc/MXU8-6KFC. Even so, one of \nPetitioner\u2019s sites recently listed 306,230 videos of \u201cper-\nfect girl porn,\u201d 579,497 videos of \u201cteen hardcore\u201d porn, \nand 328,273 videos of \u201cyoung petite porn.\u201d ROA.399. \nAnother popular category is hentai, a cartoon intro-\nduction to violent pornography which commonly features \n\u201ca grotesque creature penetrating a girl with an enor-\nmous phallus or tentacle\u201d\u2014acts which, if performed in \nreal life, would result in severe injury or death. J.A.159-\n60. Pornhub alone hosts over 100,000 of these videos. \nJ.A.159. And for customers whose tastes in domination \nand humiliation run to particular races, Petitioners have \nthat, too. One site offers 88,713 free videos of \u201cAsian \nbondage\u201d and another 91,203 of \u201cEbony bondage.\u201d \nJ.A.175. Unsurprisingly, \u201c[t]he pornography industry \nremains a bastion of explicit anti-black stereotyping\u2014\nraw, obscene, and increasing mainstreamed.\u201d David Pil-\ngrim, The Jezebel Stereotype (updated 2024), Jim Crow \nMuseum, https://perma.cc/2VT8-LVFU.  \n3. The astounding amount of online obscenity con-\ntinues to grow. Pornhub alone transferred 6,597 \npetabytes of data in 2019. Romney, supra, at 50. That \nrepresents \u201c1.36 million hours (169 years) of new con-\ntent\u201d\u2014more data than the entire internet in 2002, id. and \n90,000 times the Library of Congress, Matt Raymond, \n\n6 \n \nHow \u2018Big\u2019 is the Library of Congress?, Libr. of Cong. \nBlogs (Feb. 11, 2009), https://perma.cc/TQ5B-4NYD. Be-\nfore being forced to remove millions of its videos when \n\u201ccredit [card] companies \u2026 cut ties with\u201d it for hosting \n\u201cinappropriate and illegal videos,\u201d Paul, supra, Pornhub \nbragged that if you \u201cstarted watching 2019\u2019s new videos \nin 1850, you would still be watching them today.\u201d J.A.177. \nFurthermore, artificial intelligence is revolutionizing \nthe industry. See, e.g., Leo Herrera, AI and the Future \nof \nSex, \nMIT \nTech. \nRev. \n(Aug. \n26, \n2024), \nhttps://perma.cc/SH8C-Q6PN. \u201cUsers can now check \nboxes on a list of options as long as the Cheesecake Fac-\ntory menu \u2026: categories like male, female, and trans; \nages from 18 to 90; breast and penis size; details like \u2026 \nunderwear color; backdrops like grocery stores, \nchurches, the Eiffel Tower, and Stonehenge; even \nweather.\u201d Id. It is also possible to furtively create por-\nnography involving people in one\u2019s daily life. Id. \nB. The effects of pornography on children \n1. Pornography harms children, a fact Petitioners \nnowhere deny. Repeated exposure may trigger disasso-\nciation, \u201cdepression,\u201d and psychosomatic symptoms such \nas \u201cheadache, irritability, [and] trouble sleeping.\u201d \nJ.A.160, 162. Children who view pornography are more \nlikely to use tobacco, alcohol, or drugs and disengage \nfrom school. J.A.161. They have less social integration \nand decreased emotional attachment with caregivers. \nJ.A.160. They also experience \u201cpoor social functioning, \nimpulsiveness, and social anxiety,\u201d and \u201cdysfunctional \nstress responses and poor executive function,\u201d as well as \n\u201cimpairments to judgment, memory, and emotional reg-\nulation.\u201d J.A.162. They may also develop unrealistic ex-\npectations about their appearance. J.A.163.   \nChildren who habitually view pornography are more \n\n7 \n \nlikely to exhibit behavioral problems such as emulating \nsexual strangulation, dating violence, and sexual coer-\ncion. J.A.160-163. In fact, \u201c42% of 15-16-year-olds ex-\npressed the desire to mirror pornography\u2014and more \nthan half of all boys believe that online porn depicts re-\nalistic sexuality.\u201d J.A.161. Adolescent viewers are thus at \nhigher risk of intimate partner cyberstalking and adult \nperpetration of child sexual abuse. J.A.160-61, 164. For \ngirls, early exposure to online pornography is a risk fac-\ntor for later suffering sexual abuse, sexual coercion, and \nsexual aggression. J.A.161. And all children exposed to \npornography are \u201cmore likely to display hypersexualiza-\ntion and to develop paraphilias (e.g., exhibitionism, vo-\nyeurism).\u201d J.A.161. \nThe dramatic rise of \u201cchoking\u201d well illustrates the \ndanger, given that it is \u201cdefined by medical science as \n\u2018nonfatal strangulation\u2019\u201d and \u201cposes grave neurological \nharms to victims, including unconsciousness, brain in-\njury, seizure, motor and speech disorders, memory loss,\u201d \nand PTSD. J.A.158. Not by coincidence, children mirror \nsuch dangerous conduct. See, e.g., Peggy Orenstein, The \nTroubling Trend in Teenage Sex, N.Y. Times (Apr. 12, \n2024), https://tinyurl.com/2mp4z4j2 (tying the alarming \nspike of \u201csexual strangulation\u201d of girls \u201cbetween the ages \n[of] 12 and 17\u201d to online pornography, where such behav-\nior has become a \u201cstaple\u201d). \nFar from rebutting this trend, Petitioners\u2019 own evi-\ndence confirms that \u201call signs point to the idea that main-\nstream online pornography appears to negatively influ-\nence youth in several ways.\u201d ROA.1637.

Ginsberg v. New York, 390 U.S. 629, 634-35 \n(1968). Nevertheless, Petitioners insist that because they \nhave moved their business online, the First Amendment \nprotects their right to distribute a nearly inexhaustible \namount of obscenity to any child with a smartphone. \nFor nearly thirty years, due to technological limita-\ntions, governments have struggled to translate Ginsberg \nfrom bookstores to the internet. See Ashcroft v. ACLU \n(Ashcroft II), 542 U.S. 656 (2004); Reno v. ACLU, 521 \nU.S. 844 (1997). Technology, however, has evolved: \nAround the world, websites can and do create adult-only \nzones where adults can view materials unsuited for chil-\ndren. The question presented here is thus: \n \nGiven that a State may, consistent with the Constitu-\ntion, restrict minors\u2019 access to pornographic materials, \nwhether it is facially unconstitutional for a State to re-\nquire a commercial entity that provides such materials to \ntake commercially reasonable steps to verify the age of \nits customers. \n \n\n \n(II) \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nPage \nQuestion Presented ...........................................................

Like \n\u201cdoomscrolling\u201d on social media, online pornographers \nuse sophisticated algorithms to keep adults who have \ngreater maturity than children on their sites. Childhood \naccess to this avalanche of misogynistic and often violent \nsmut \u201c\u2018is creating a public health crisis.\u2019\u201d Marc Novicoff, \nA Simple Law is Doing the Impossible. It\u2019s Making the \nOnline Porn Industry Retreat, Politico (Aug. 8, 2023) \n(quoting Louisiana age-verification bill), https://ti-\nnyurl.com/Novicoff2023.  \nIn 2023, the Texas Legislature\u2014voting 164 to 1\u2014ad-\ndressed this crisis by enacting House Bill 1181 (\u201cH.B. \n1181\u201d). H.B. 1181 does not prevent adults from viewing \npornography. Instead, it requires online pornographers \nto take commercially reasonable steps to ensure that \ntheir customers are not children. Nor is H.B. 1181 an out-\nlier. Countries all around the world require online por-\nnographers to use age-verification technology.     \n \nPetitioners say little about what they sell. But even \nthey admit (at 3) that Texas has a compelling interest in \npreventing children from viewing the content on their \nwebsites. This Court has held\u2014\u201ccategorically\u201d\u2014that \n\u201cobscene material is unprotected by the First Amend-\nment,\u201d Miller v. California, 413 U.S. 15, 23 (1973), and \nhas emphasized that States may prevent \u201cthe sale to mi-\nnors of sexual material that would be obscene from the \nperspective of a child \u2026 so long as the legislature\u2019s judg-\nment that the proscribed materials [are] harmful to chil-\ndren \u2018[is] not irrational.\u2019\u201d Brown v. Ent. Merchs. Ass\u2019n, \n564 U.S. 786, 793-94 (2011) (quoting Ginsberg, 390 U.S. \n\n2 \n \nat 641). States thus can require brick-and-mortar retail-\ners peddling obscenity to verify the ages of their custom-\ners. Ginsberg, 390 U.S. at 634-35. Indeed, all \u201c50 States\u201d \nbar minors from buying \u201cpornographic materials.\u201d \nThompson v. Oklahoma, 487 U.S. 815, 824 (1988). \n \nBecause no one disputes that Texas can prevent kids \nfrom accessing hardcore pornography, this case is about \nmeans, not ends. Petitioners would prefer that the pro-\ntection of children be left to device manufacturers. But \nwhere, as here, the level of constitutional protection de-\npends on the identity of the listener, a State can require \nthe speaker to serve as a gatekeeper. See Sable \nCommc\u2019ns of Cal., Inc. v. FCC, 492 U.S. 115, 125-26 \n(1989). That principle of law has not changed just be-\ncause obscenity has moved online. \n \nEven if Ginsberg were inapplicable in cyberspace, \nhowever, H.B. 1181 would still easily survive. Texas \nseeks to protect kids from some of the most prurient sex-\nual content imaginable. And the means Texas has chosen \nis appropriate. Texas has addressed only websites dedi-\ncated to pornography, has allowed them to comply by us-\ning common age-verification technology, and has not im-\nposed criminal penalties. Such a modest but important \nlaw satisfies any level of scrutiny.   \n \nThat point is especially true, moreover, in the posture \nof a facial, pre-enforcement preliminary injunction. Peti-\ntioners\u2019 decision to facially challenge H.B. 1181 \u201ccomes \nat a cost.\u201d Moody v. NetChoice, 144 S.Ct. 2383, 2397 \n(2024). They must show that \u201ca substantial number of \n[the law\u2019s] applications are unconstitutional, judged in \nrelation to the statute\u2019s plainly legitimate sweep.\u201d Id. \nThey cannot because much of the content on their web-\nsites is obscene even for adults. No one has a constitu-\ntional right to view \u201cteen bondage gangbang\u201d videos, \n\n3 \n \nmuch less hundreds of thousands of them. J.A.176. And \nbecause this case concerns the extraordinary remedy of \na preliminary injunction, Petitioners must show more \nthan just a substantial likelihood of success on the mer-\nits. Yet they have not identified a single person who has \nbeen chilled. By any measure, the Fifth Circuit correctly \nvacated the district court\u2019s flawed injunction. \n \nSTATEMENT \nI. Children and Online Pornography \nA. The online pornography industry \n1. Petitioners say almost nothing about what\u2019s on \ntheir websites. Suffice it to say, they are not streaming \n\u201cromance novels or R-rated movies.\u201d Contra Pet.Br.1. \nPetitioners include (1) an association of pornographic ac-\ntors, producers, distributors, and retailers; (2) foreign \nand domestic producers, sellers, and licensers of pornog-\nraphy; and (3) Jane Doe, a pornographic performer. \nROA.19-24.1 Petitioner MG Freesites Ltd. operates \nPornhub\u2014\u201cthe 12th most visited website in the world \u2026 \nahead of Amazon, TikTok, and LinkedIn.\u201d Bradley \nSaacks, Inside Pornhub\u2019s Finances, Semafor (Jul. 27, \n2023), https://perma.cc/EC8Q-3FEU; ROA.21. \n \nOnline pornographers are sophisticated. Like social-\nmedia companies, they use complex algorithms to hook \nusers. See, e.g., Amy Adler, Arousal by Algorithm, 109 \nCornell L. Rev. 787, 811 (2024). Their content triggers \nneurological effects akin to gambling. See Todd Love et \nal., Neuroscience of Internet Pornography Addiction: A \nReview and Update, 5(3) Behavioral Sciences 388 (2015); \nsee also J.A.254 (H.B. 1181 bill analysis noting that por-\nnography is biologically addictive). \n \n1 \u201cROA\u201d refers to the record on appeal. \n\n4 \n \n \nPetitioners\u2019 business models generally fall into two \ncategories: \nadvertisement-based \nand \nsubscription-\nbased. The first generates revenue from \u201cadvertising \nplacements on its website and through referral fees.\u201d \nROA.249. The second generates revenue from subscrip-\ntions\u2014often paid for with personal credit cards, com-\nplete with identifying information. ROA.250-51.  \n2. As online pornographers have become more so-\nphisticated, the type of content they display has also \nchanged. Now, websites use their \u201cextraordinary trove \nof user data to script pornography (often using A/B test-\ning), giving data-driven specific requirements to porn \nproducers to fulfill.\u201d Adler, supra, at 813. This creates \nwhat one scholar has identified as an \u201cA.I.-driven feed-\nback loop\u201d in which pornography \u201cgains the capacity to \ncrystalize, amplify, and distort desire itself.\u201d Id. \n \n\u201cMost of today\u2019s pornography,\u201d moreover, \u201cdoes not \nreflect consensual, loving, healthy relationships\u201d but \n\u201cteaches dominance, aggression, disrespect, and objecti-\nfication.\u201d Byrin Romney, Screens, Teens, and Porn \nScenes: Legislative Approaches to Protecting Youth \nfrom Exposure to Pornography, 45 Vt. L. Rev. 43, 43 \n(2020) (emphasis omitted). For example, and Texas re-\ncites the following with considerable reluctance, in one of \nPetitioner Xnxx\u2019s more than 300,000 free videos of \u201cteen \nbondage gangbang[s],\u201d five men tie a young woman down \nwith electrical tape and take turns penetrating her \norally, vaginally, and anally\u2014sometimes simultaneously. \nJ.A.176. In this 36-minute video\u2014viewed more than \n650,000 times as of August 2023\u2014the men choke the \nwoman and eventually strap an open-mouth gag or \n\u201cmouth spreader\u201d over her head, forcing her mouth open \nwhile they ejaculate in it. J.A.176.  \nThis video is far from unique. Gagging, slapping, hair \n\n5 \n \npulling, spanking, and increasingly choking are the five \nmost common forms of physical aggression found in por-\nnography, and women are the targets of such violence \n97% of the time. J.A.158. In 2020, Pornhub removed \u201cmil-\nlions of videos\u2014the majority of its content\u2014after an in-\nvestigation revealed a large number of them featured un-\nderaged and sex-trafficked subjects.\u201d Kari Paul, Porn-\nhub Removes Millions of Videos After Investigation \nFinds Child Abuse Content, The Guardian (Dec. 14, \n2020), https://perma.cc/MXU8-6KFC. Even so, one of \nPetitioner\u2019s sites recently listed 306,230 videos of \u201cper-\nfect girl porn,\u201d 579,497 videos of \u201cteen hardcore\u201d porn, \nand 328,273 videos of \u201cyoung petite porn.\u201d ROA.399. \nAnother popular category is hentai, a cartoon intro-\nduction to violent pornography which commonly features \n\u201ca grotesque creature penetrating a girl with an enor-\nmous phallus or tentacle\u201d\u2014acts which, if performed in \nreal life, would result in severe injury or death. J.A.159-\n60. Pornhub alone hosts over 100,000 of these videos. \nJ.A.159. And for customers whose tastes in domination \nand humiliation run to particular races, Petitioners have \nthat, too. One site offers 88,713 free videos of \u201cAsian \nbondage\u201d and another 91,203 of \u201cEbony bondage.\u201d \nJ.A.175. Unsurprisingly, \u201c[t]he pornography industry \nremains a bastion of explicit anti-black stereotyping\u2014\nraw, obscene, and increasing mainstreamed.\u201d David Pil-\ngrim, The Jezebel Stereotype (updated 2024), Jim Crow \nMuseum, https://perma.cc/2VT8-LVFU.  \n3. The astounding amount of online obscenity con-\ntinues to grow. Pornhub alone transferred 6,597 \npetabytes of data in 2019. Romney, supra, at 50. That \nrepresents \u201c1.36 million hours (169 years) of new con-\ntent\u201d\u2014more data than the entire internet in 2002, id. and \n90,000 times the Library of Congress, Matt Raymond, \n\n6 \n \nHow \u2018Big\u2019 is the Library of Congress?, Libr. of Cong. \nBlogs (Feb. 11, 2009), https://perma.cc/TQ5B-4NYD. Be-\nfore being forced to remove millions of its videos when \n\u201ccredit [card] companies \u2026 cut ties with\u201d it for hosting \n\u201cinappropriate and illegal videos,\u201d Paul, supra, Pornhub \nbragged that if you \u201cstarted watching 2019\u2019s new videos \nin 1850, you would still be watching them today.\u201d J.A.177. \nFurthermore, artificial intelligence is revolutionizing \nthe industry. See, e.g., Leo Herrera, AI and the Future \nof \nSex, \nMIT \nTech. \nRev. \n(Aug. \n26, \n2024), \nhttps://perma.cc/SH8C-Q6PN. \u201cUsers can now check \nboxes on a list of options as long as the Cheesecake Fac-\ntory menu \u2026: categories like male, female, and trans; \nages from 18 to 90; breast and penis size; details like \u2026 \nunderwear color; backdrops like grocery stores, \nchurches, the Eiffel Tower, and Stonehenge; even \nweather.\u201d Id. It is also possible to furtively create por-\nnography involving people in one\u2019s daily life. Id. \nB. The effects of pornography on children \n1. Pornography harms children, a fact Petitioners \nnowhere deny. Repeated exposure may trigger disasso-\nciation, \u201cdepression,\u201d and psychosomatic symptoms such \nas \u201cheadache, irritability, [and] trouble sleeping.\u201d \nJ.A.160, 162. Children who view pornography are more \nlikely to use tobacco, alcohol, or drugs and disengage \nfrom school. J.A.161. They have less social integration \nand decreased emotional attachment with caregivers. \nJ.A.160. They also experience \u201cpoor social functioning, \nimpulsiveness, and social anxiety,\u201d and \u201cdysfunctional \nstress responses and poor executive function,\u201d as well as \n\u201cimpairments to judgment, memory, and emotional reg-\nulation.\u201d J.A.162. They may also develop unrealistic ex-\npectations about their appearance. J.A.163.   \nChildren who habitually view pornography are more \n\n7 \n \nlikely to exhibit behavioral problems such as emulating \nsexual strangulation, dating violence, and sexual coer-\ncion. J.A.160-163. In fact, \u201c42% of 15-16-year-olds ex-\npressed the desire to mirror pornography\u2014and more \nthan half of all boys believe that online porn depicts re-\nalistic sexuality.\u201d J.A.161. Adolescent viewers are thus at \nhigher risk of intimate partner cyberstalking and adult \nperpetration of child sexual abuse. J.A.160-61, 164. For \ngirls, early exposure to online pornography is a risk fac-\ntor for later suffering sexual abuse, sexual coercion, and \nsexual aggression. J.A.161. And all children exposed to \npornography are \u201cmore likely to display hypersexualiza-\ntion and to develop paraphilias (e.g., exhibitionism, vo-\nyeurism).\u201d J.A.161. \nThe dramatic rise of \u201cchoking\u201d well illustrates the \ndanger, given that it is \u201cdefined by medical science as \n\u2018nonfatal strangulation\u2019\u201d and \u201cposes grave neurological \nharms to victims, including unconsciousness, brain in-\njury, seizure, motor and speech disorders, memory loss,\u201d \nand PTSD. J.A.158. Not by coincidence, children mirror \nsuch dangerous conduct. See, e.g., Peggy Orenstein, The \nTroubling Trend in Teenage Sex, N.Y. Times (Apr. 12, \n2024), https://tinyurl.com/2mp4z4j2 (tying the alarming \nspike of \u201csexual strangulation\u201d of girls \u201cbetween the ages \n[of] 12 and 17\u201d to online pornography, where such behav-\nior has become a \u201cstaple\u201d). \nFar from rebutting this trend, Petitioners\u2019 own evi-\ndence confirms that \u201call signs point to the idea that main-\nstream online pornography appears to negatively influ-\nence youth in several ways.\u201d ROA.1637. It may \u201cnega-\ntively influence attitudes towards women,\u201d \u201ccause de-\npression, anxiety, decreases in well-being, reduced self-\nesteem,\u201d and cause \u201crisker sexual behaviors (such as \ncondom non-use), a likelihood to experience unhealthy \n\n8 \n \ndating relationships, [and] a tendency to perpetrate \nand/or experience sexual violence.\u201d ROA.1637-39. \nC. Children\u2019s exposure to online pornography \nChildhood exposure to obscenity has increased as \nonline pornography\u2019s reach and sophistication has \ngrown. In fact, \u201capproximately one in five youth experi-\nence unwanted online exposure to sexually explicit mate-\nrial.\u201d J.A.241 (bill analysis for H.B. 1181). \nThe last two decades have also seen a dramatic in-\ncrease in the number of children under 13 exposed to \npornography\u2014despite content filtering. In 2006, just \nover 25% of children aged 13 or younger were exposed to \nonline pornography. See Chiara Sabina, et al., The Na-\nture and Dynamics of Internet Pornography Exposure \nfor Youth, 11 CyberPsychology & Behavior 691, 692 \n(2008). By 2022, that number more than doubled to 54%. \nSee Michael B. Robb & Supreet Mann, Common Sense \nMedia, \nTeens \nand \nPornography \nat \n5 \n(2022), \nhttps://perma.cc/YG3L-W3LK. And the number of chil-\ndren exposed to online pornography at age 10 or younger \nincreased more than seven-fold from less than 2% in 2008 \nto 15% by 2022. Id; Sabina, supra at 692.  \n \nIf the picture these statistics paint was not disturbing \nenough, it becomes even darker when the kind of por-\nnography is considered. Over a third of boys exposed to \npornography reported viewing \u201c[s]exual activity involv-\ning bondage\u201d; almost a third, \u201c[s]exual activity between \npeople and animals\u201d; over a fifth, \u201c[s]exual activity in-\nvolving urine or feces\u201d; and almost that many, \u201c[r]ape or \nsexual violence.\u201d Sabina, supra, at 693. And all of that \nwas before the explosion of smartphones. Today, \u201cusing \nsmartphones to access free pornography online is the \nmost common means of viewing pornographic material.\u201d \nAmanda Giordano, What to Know About Adolescent \n\n9 \n \nPornography Exposure, Psychology Today (Feb. 27, \n2022), https://tinyurl.com/GiordanoPsych. \n \nD. Age-verification technology \n1. Age verification is a generic term that refers to a \nset of techniques and technologies to determine some-\none\u2019s likely age. J.A.49. It is used for any number of age-\nrestricted products and services such as online gambling, \nalcohol and tobacco sales, and car rentals. J.A.194, 198. \nSuch technology can determine a person\u2019s age in various \nways, including by government identification, credit \ncards, credit checks, bank records, and even age estima-\ntion through facial, voice, or behavioral analysis. J.A.188-\n91. Age may also be inferred by the existence of some \nother fact\u2014for example, someone who is a commercial \nairline pilot must be over 18. J.A.187, 189.  \nAge verification often does not take place on the web-\nsite that requires it. J.A.185. Instead, a person can obtain \nverification from a third-party provider by downloading \nan age-verification app (such as Yoti) or visiting an age-\nverification provider\u2019s website. J.A.185-86, 189, 201. An \nage-restricted website can also redirect customers to a \nthird-party provider, who typically offers consumers \ntheir choice of age-verification method. J.A.186. Regard-\nless of how a person first contacts a third-party provider, \nthat provider usually relays to the purveyor of the age-\nrestricted product only the answer to a single question: \nIs this person 18 years or older? Yes or No. J.A.185.  \nThis process is not one that adults must undertake \nevery time they wish to access pornographic material on \nthe internet. Instead, an age-verified person may travel \nthrough the internet with a token that signifies their sta-\ntus as an adult\u2014and nothing more\u2014to each age-re-\nstricted website they visit. J.A.186, 197-98.  \n2. Age verification has become an increasingly \n\n10 \n \ncommon feature of online commerce. The pornographic \nwebsite OnlyFans, for example, uses Yoti, one of the \nworld\u2019s largest third-party providers. J.A.181. And after \nthe public relations and legal crises resulting in the re-\nmoval of millions of videos, Pornhub also began using \nYoti to verify the ages of content providers\u2014but not con-\ntent viewers. J.A.181. Pornhub and others have age-ver-\nification technology built into their systems. J.A.285. \nCountries around the world require age verification \nfor online pornography, including Australia, France, \nGermany, and the United Kingdom. Last year, the Eu-\nropean Union ordered three of the largest online pornog-\nraphers (Pornhub, XVideos and Stripchat) to verify the \nage of users. BBC, Porn Viewers in EU May Have to \nProve Their Age (Dec. 20, 2023), https://perma.cc/Y3R2-\nGXLV.  \nNor does age verification suggest that an adult views \npornography. J.A.203. This service \u201cis widely used by \nthousands of sellers and their consumers on a daily basis \naround the world, in a variety of contexts\u201d that have \nnothing to do with pornography. J.A.181, 209. For exam-\nple, the millions of customers who use DraftKings for \nfantasy sports betting must verify their ages using a \nthird-party verification provider. See, e.g., IDTech, So-\ncure to Provide Biometric Onboarding Tech for \nDraftKings (Apr. 9, 2021), https://perma.cc/7VFG-\nWTDX. Age verification thus is not only doable\u2014it\u2019s al-\nready being done. J.A.181, 209. \nII. H.B. 1181 \nIn H.B. 1181, Texas enacted an age-verification re-\nquirement to address three realities: (1) the internet con-\ntains vast amounts of obscenity easily accessed by kids, \n(2) today\u2019s online obscenity is especially harmful to chil-\ndren, and (3) age-verification technology is increasingly \n\n11 \n \ncommon across industries and allows websites to identify \nwhen their customers are children.  \nSpecifically, H.B. 1181 requires pornographic web-\nsites to \u201cuse reasonable age verification methods\u201d to ver-\nify that a customer \u201cis 18 years of age or older.\u201d Tex. Civ. \nPrac. & Rem. Code \u00a7129B.002(a).2 It applies to commer-\ncial entities that \u201cknowingly and intentionally publish[] \nor distribute[] material on an Internet website, including \na social media platform, more than one-third of which is \nsexual material harmful to minors.\u201d Id.  \nH.B. 1181 defines \u201c[s]exual material harmful to mi-\nnors\u201d based on this Court\u2019s test for obscenity to encom-\npass material that (1) \u201cappeal[s] to or pander[s] to the \nprurient interest\u201d when taken as a whole and with re-\nspect to minors; (2) describes, displays or depicts \u201cin a \nmanner patently offensive with respect to minors\u201d vari-\nous sex acts and portions of the human anatomy, includ-\ning depictions of \u201csexual intercourse, masturbation, sod-\nomy, bestiality, oral copulation, flagellation, [and] excre-\ntory functions\u201d; and (3) \u201clacks serious literary, artistic, \npolitical, or scientific value for minors.\u201d Id. \u00a7129B.001(6); \ncompare Miller, 413 U.S. at 24-25.  \nTo comply with H.B. 1181, a covered website need not \nchange anything it posts. Instead, it must require cus-\ntomers to (1) \u201cprovide digital identification\u201d or (2) \u201ccom-\nply with a commercial age verification system that veri-\nfies age using\u201d a \u201cgovernment-issued identification\u201d or \n\u201ccommercially reasonable method that relies on public or \nprivate transactional data to verify the age of an \n \n2 H.B. 1181 also requires such websites to provide health warn-\nings about the dangers of pornography. Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. \nCode \u00a7129B.004(1). The district court enjoined that provision, \nPet.App.136a-50a; the Fifth Circuit affirmed the injunction, \nPet.App.27a-38a; and Texas has not sought relief from this Court. \n\n12 \n \nindividual.\u201d Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code \u00a7129B.003(b). \nCovered websites thus may use third-party providers \nlike Yoti. And to ensure user privacy, the age-verifier \n\u201cmay not retain any identifying information of the indi-\nvidual.\u201d Id. \u00a7129B.002(b). And, of course, if a covered \nwebsite is concerned that an age-verification provider \nmay wrongly transmit information to others, it can \nchoose a different provider or do age verification itself. \nId. \u00a7129B.003(b). \nH.B. 1181 empowers the Attorney General to bring \ncivil-enforcement actions for injunctive relief, civil pen-\nalties, and attorneys\u2019 fees and costs. Id. \u00a7129B.006.  \nIII. Procedural History \nH.B. 1181 was to go into effect on September 1, 2023. \nPet.App.175a. On August 4, 2023, Petitioners brought a \npre-enforcement facial challenge. ROA.16-46. No adult \nviewer of pornography in Texas joined the suit. ROA.20. \nAs relevant here, Petitioners allege that H.B. 1181\u2019s \nage-verification requirement violates the First Amend-\nment. ROA.42-43. They moved for a preliminary injunc-\ntion, ROA.54-83, and the district court held a hearing less \nthan three weeks later, ROA.1829-96. The only live wit-\nness was the State\u2019s expert, J.A.267-86, who explained \nthat age verification is \u201cnot new\u201d for pornographic web-\nsites, which \u201cuse it elsewhere in the world,\u201d J.A.285.  \nEight days later, the district court\u2014applying strict \nscrutiny\u2014issued a preliminary injunction facially enjoin-\ning enforcement of H.B. 1181\u2019s age-verification require-\nment. Pet.App.107a-36a. Yet rather than evaluating the \n\u201cfull range\u201d of H.B. 1181\u2019s applications and then deter-\nmining whether the law\u2019s supposedly \u201cunconstitutional \napplications substantially outweigh its constitutional \nones,\u201d NetChoice, 144 S.Ct. at 2397, the court refused to \nview even a sample of the content on Petitioners\u2019 \n\n13 \n \nwebsites, ROA.1881. Instead, it insisted that mainstream \nmovies with partial nudity and simulated sex like those \non Netflix are \u201cas raw as any pornography,\u201d ROA.1877-\n78; but see J.A.175 (Xnxx.com\u2019s six categories of \u201cbond-\nage\u201d videos). \nThe Fifth Circuit administratively stayed the district \ncourt\u2019s preliminary injunction and expedited oral argu-\nment. Pet.App.167a-68a. A month later, the court stayed \nthe injunction pending resolution of the appeal. \nPet.App.165a-66a. In March 2024, the Fifth Circuit va-\ncated the injunction of H.B. 1181\u2019s age-verification re-\nquirement. Pet.App.8a-27a. It relied on Ginsberg to con-\nclude that \u201cregulations of the distribution to minors of \nmaterials obscene for minors are subject only to ra-\ntional-basis review.\u201d Pet.App.8a. The court distinguished \nReno because the law there was far broader than H.B. \n1181 and Ashcroft II because it did not consider which \nlevel of scrutiny applied. Pet.App.13a-19a. The Fifth Cir-\ncuit then \u201ceasily\u201d concluded Texas satisfied rational-ba-\nsis review. Pet.App.26a-27a. Judge Higginbotham dis-\nsented, concluding that strict scrutiny applied because \nH.B. 1181 limited adult access to protected speech, \nPet.App.47a-48a, and content filtering and the like are \nless restrictive alternatives, Pet.App.76a-78a.3 \nThe Fifth Circuit thereafter denied Petitioners\u2019 re-\nquest to stay issuance of its mandate. Pet.App.162a-63a. \nThis Court denied Petitioners\u2019 emergency application to \nstay the mandate on April 30, 2024. Accordingly, H.B. \n1181\u2019s age-verification requirement has been in effect \nsince September 19, 2023. Following the Fifth Circuit\u2019s \ndecision, moreover, one prominent pornography website \n \n3 Petitioners also made arguments about vagueness or whether \nthey fall within H.B. 1181\u2019s scope. They do not advance such argu-\nments here.    \n\n14 \n \ncommitted to using an age-verification service. See Press \nRelease, Office of Attorney General of Texas, Texas Se-\ncures Settlement with Operator of Major Pornography \nWebsite, Ensuring Compliance with Texas Law (Apr. \n26, 2024), https://perma.cc/UV63-WPX9.  \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \n\u201cFor the first time in the history of humanity, chil-\ndren can easily be exposed to the most extreme, miso-\ngynistic sex acts imaginable, thanks to the phenomenon \nof Internet porn.\u201d David Horsey, Our Social Experi-\nment: Kids with Access to Hard-Core Porn, L.A. Times \n(Sept. 3, 2013), https://perma.cc/9DGH-NZBN. That \u201cso-\ncial experiment,\u201d id., has failed. To address a public-\nhealth crisis, Texas did not restrict adult access to por-\nnography. Instead, Texas imposed an age-verification \nrequirement\u2014just as governments have done the world \nover for this industry and others. Petitioners cannot \nshow that H.B. 1181 is unconstitutional under the correct \nlevel of scrutiny\u2014rational basis\u2014or any other. And they \nespecially cannot make that showing in the context of a \nfacial, pre-enforcement preliminary injunction.   \nI. The Fifth Circuit followed Ginsberg and Sable. \nWhere the level of constitutional scrutiny depends on the \nnature of the audience, Sable allows a State to put the \nonus on the speaker to serve as the gatekeeper. And \nGinsberg\u2014which upheld a State\u2019s power to require \nbrick-and-mortar retailers to prevent children from \nviewing obscenity\u2014employs a rational-basis test.   \nPetitioners offer a bevy of counterarguments, but \neach misfires. H.B. 1181 is not \u201ccontent based\u201d because \nthe question it asks is whether the content is constitu-\ntionally protected in the first place. Such threshold de-\nterminations have never been subjected to strict-scru-\ntiny review. See, e.g., United States v. Stevens, 559 U.S. \n\n15 \n \n460, 468-69 (2010). Otherwise, a State could not criminal-\nize speech that facilitates crime without triggering strict \nscrutiny. And the suggestion that States cannot express \ndisapproval of obscenity\u2014a \u201cvalueless\u201d category of \nspeech, Counterman v. Colorado, 600 U.S. 66, 73 \n(2023)\u2014turns the First Amendment on its head.    \nNor did Ashcroft II overrule Sable and Ginsberg. Be-\ncause it is just as easy for websites to ensure that those \nwishing to gamble, buy alcohol, or view pornography are \nadults as it is for brick-and-mortar shopkeepers, Texas \nacted well within its police power by imposing that re-\nquirement on websites trafficking in hardcore pornogra-\nphy. And if Ashcroft II prevents Texas from requiring \nPetitioners to use the same age-verification services as \ncomparable websites, Ashcroft II must be overruled. Re-\nliable age verification was not on the table twenty years \nago. That is not remotely true today.   \nII.  Even if heightened scrutiny applied, the prelimi-\nnary injunction would still fail. Any heightened standard \ncould only be intermediate scrutiny, but H.B. 1181 would \nclear even strict scrutiny. Not only is Texas\u2019s interest \noverwhelming, H.B. 1181 focuses on websites causing the \nmost harm to children. And as more than two decades of \nfailed filtering confirms, Texas cannot vindicate its inter-\nest in any other way.  \nAgain, Petitioners\u2019 counterarguments fail. They say \nthat H.B. 1181 is not narrowly tailored because Texas \ndoes not regulate every website where obscenity is avail-\nable. Yet Texas \u201cmay focus on [its] most pressing con-\ncerns\u201d and \u201cneed not address all aspects of [the] problem \nin one fell swoop.\u201d Williams-Yulee v. Fla. Bar, 575 U.S. \n433, 449 (2015). Petitioners also urge content filtering \nbut cannot show it is \u201cat least as effective\u201d as age verifi-\ncation. Reno, 521 U.S. at 874. To the contrary, despite \n\n16 \n \nwidespread availability, filtering \u201chas proven an ineffec-\ntive mechanism.\u201d J.A.207.  \nIII. Petitioners also cannot successfully bring a facial \nchallenge. Because such challenges \u201crest on speculation\u201d \nabout how a law will be interpreted and what the facts \nwill reveal, a plaintiff ordinarily must show that the law \nis \u201cunconstitutional in all of its applications.\u201d Wash. State \nGrange v. Wash. State Republican Party, 552 U.S. 442, \n449-50 (2008). Although the Court has shown greater so-\nlicitude to free-speech claims, see, e.g., NetChoice, 144 \nS.Ct. at 2397, a facial injunction blocking enforcement of \na state law is \u201cstrong medicine\u201d presenting significant \nseparation-of-powers concerns, Broadrick v. Oklahoma, \n413 U.S. 601, 613 (1973).  \nPetitioners have not come close to meeting their bur-\nden. Even on the incomplete record before the Court, \nmuch of the content here is plainly obscene\u2014and thus \nconstitutionally unprotected\u2014even for adults. The dis-\ntrict court, however, committed a more egregious ver-\nsion of the error identified in NetChoice. Not only did it \nfail to consider each application of H.B. 1181, it did not \neven consider H.B. 1181\u2019s heartland. Instead, it specu-\nlated about hypothetical applications while refusing to \nreview the content squarely at issue. Petitioners, how-\never, cannot complain that their adult customers\u2019 consti-\ntutional rights have been chilled based on content that \nthose customers have no constitutional right to view. \nIV. Finally, a preliminary injunction is an \u201cextraordi-\nnary remedy\u201d that is never awarded as of right. Winter \nv. NRDC, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 24 (2008). Instead, a plaintiff \n\u201cmust establish\u201d not only \u201cthat he is likely to succeed on \nthe merits,\u201d but also \u201cthat he is likely to suffer irrepara-\nble harm in the absence of preliminary relief\u201d and \u201cthat \nan injunction is in the public interest.\u201d Id. at 20. Here, \n\n17 \n \neven if Petitioners satisfied their burden with respect to \nthe merits, they flunked the other requirements. They \ndid not identify a single adult who has been chilled from \nvisiting their websites, and they cannot show that any \n(nonexistent) injury outweighs harm to children. En-\nforcement of H.B. 1181 has been permitted for more than \na year and the sky has not fallen. The Court should retain \nthat status quo while litigation continues.   \nARGUMENT \nI. The Fifth Circuit Applied the Correct Test. \nBecause H.B. 1181 imposes a gatekeeping function \nthat forecloses only minors from accessing obscenity, \nthe Fifth Circuit properly applied Ginsberg\u2019s rational-\nbasis analysis. Pet.App.8a-10a. Petitioners do not ques-\ntion that Ginsberg states the proper test for minors\u2019 ac-\ncess to such content, only (at 20-21) whether Ginsberg \napplies when the question is whether prohibiting access \nby minors allegedly impedes access by adults. Petition-\ners are wrong: Requiring commercial enterprises to take \ncommercially reasonable steps to verify that their cus-\ntomers are adults need only be a rational way to combat \nthe harms that even Petitioners accept (at 3) their prod-\nucts cause children. \nA. Ginsberg\u2019s rational-basis test governs. \n1. In Ginsberg, New York took this Court\u2019s then-ex-\nisting definition of obscenity and adjusted it for kids. 390 \nU.S. at 635. Thus, the State decreed that material \n\u201c[h]armful to minors\u201d included content that \u201cpredomi-\nnantly appeals to the prurient, shameful or morbid inter-\nest of minors\u201d and \u201cis utterly without redeeming social \nimportance for minors,\u201d among other elements. Id. at \n646. New York then made it unlawful for businesses to \nknowingly sell such material to minors, but provided that \n\n18 \n \nan honest mistake about age would excuse liability if the \nshopkeeper made a \u201creasonable bona fide attempt\u201d to as-\ncertain the customer\u2019s age. Id. at 631, 646. One obvious \nway to do so was by reviewing identification. See, e.g., \nLeading Cases: Freedom of Speech and Expression, 118 \nHarv. L. Rev. 353, 363 & n.85 (2004). \nConsidering a First Amendment challenge to the law, \nthe Court first concluded that a child\u2019s rights do not pre-\nvent States from defining obscenity based on its appeal \nto minors. Ginsberg, 390 U.S. at 637-39. The Court then \nidentified two interests to support the law: (1) parental \ninterests in deciding whether their children should view \nsuch material, and (2) the State\u2019s independent interest in \nthe well-being of children. Id. at 639-41. Because \u201cob-\nscenity is not protected expression,\u201d the Court required \nonly that New York have made a \u201crational\u201d decision that \nexposure to such material be harmful to minors. Id. at \n641-43. Concluding New York had, the Court rejected \nthe constitutional challenge. Id. \nSince deciding Ginsburg, the Court has reiterated its \nholdings many times. In Erznoznik v. City of Jackson-\nville, for example, the Court cited Ginsberg for the \u201cwell \nsettled\u201d proposition that governments \u201ccan adopt more \nstringent controls on communicative materials available \nto youths than on those available to adults.\u201d 422 U.S. 205, \n212 (1975). In Young v. American Mini Theatres, Inc., a \nplurality considering zoning rules for adult movie thea-\nters invoked Ginsberg to explain that \u201cthe Members of \nthe Court who would accord the greatest protection to \nsuch materials have repeatedly indicated that the State \ncould prohibit the distribution or exhibition of such ma-\nterials to juveniles and unconsenting adults.\u201d 427 U.S. \n50, 69 (1976) (plurality op.) And in Brown, the Court ex-\nplained\u2014without qualification\u2014that because \u201cobscenity \n\n19 \n \nis not protected expression,\u201d laws like that at issue in \nGinsberg that address obscenity for children need only \nbe rational. 564 U.S. at 794. \n2. The Court\u2019s decision in Sable makes explicit what \nwas already implicit in Ginsberg: Where the level of con-\nstitutional protection depends on the audience, States \nmay require the speaker to serve as the primary gate-\nkeeper to that audience. 492 U.S. at 125-26. The federal \nlaw at issue in Sable prohibited making, by way of an in-\nterstate telephone call, \u201cany obscene or indecent commu-\nnication for commercial purposes.\u201d Id. at 123 n.4. Sable \noperated \u201cdial-a-porn\u201d phone lines, offering prere-\ncorded, sexually explicit messages. Id. at 117-18. Uphold-\ning the ban on \u201cobscene\u201d phone calls, the Court explained \nthat the statute did not impose a national standard of ob-\nscenity but instead relied on \u201ccontemporary community \nstandards,\u201d as required by Miller. Id. at 124-25.   \nJudged by each individual community\u2019s standards, \nthe same recorded messages might be considered ob-\nscene (and therefore unprotected by the First Amend-\nment) in some communities but not obscene (and there-\nfore protected) in others. Id. at 125-26. Sable objected \nthat it was not its burden as speaker to distinguish be-\ntween those listeners. This Court disagreed, holding that \n\u201c[i]f Sable\u2019s audience is comprised of different communi-\nties with different local standards, Sable ultimately \nbears the burden of complying with the prohibition on \nobscene messages.\u201d Id. at 126. The Court recognized that \nSable might be \u201cforced to incur some costs\u201d to develop \nand implement its own \u201csystem\u201d to determine the locale \nof incoming calls but found \u201cno constitutional impedi-\nment\u201d to the imposition of such costs. Id. at 125.  \nThe principle from Sable is thus plain: Where a \nspeaker\u2019s audience consists of two groups\u2014one to whom \n\n20 \n \nthe speaker has the right to speak a particular message \nand another to whom the speaker does not\u2014the State \nmay place the onus on the speaker to distinguish be-\ntween the groups. See id. at 126. Such a rule makes \nsense. It is less invasive on speech when the speaker as-\nsesses his own listeners, rather than when the govern-\nment does so. Thus, even if distinguishing between lis-\nteners imposes costs, a State may require the speaker to \nserve as gatekeeper. See, e.g., Ashcroft v. ACLU (Ash-\ncroft I), 535 U.S. 564, 583 (2002) (plurality op.); see also \nid. at 582 (\u201cIn [Sable], this Court made no effort to eval-\nuate how burdensome it would have been for dial-a-porn \noperators to tailor their messages [because] the burden \nof complying with the statute rested with those compa-\nnies.\u201d). \n3. The Fifth Circuit thus correctly recognized that \nGinsberg controls this case: H.B. 1181 adjusts this \nCourt\u2019s definition of obscenity as it applies to minors, \nTex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code \u00a7129B.001(6); does not bar \nadult access to material that is obscene as to minors; is \nsupported by the same state interests as in Ginsberg that \nhave only grown more compelling; and is rationally re-\nlated to those interests (a point Petitioners do not con-\ntest).  \nTrue, one distinction between H.B. 1181 and the New \nYork law in Ginsberg is that H.B. 1181 makes age verifi-\ncation mandatory, id. \u00a7129B.002(a), while New York \nmade it an affirmative defense, Ginsberg, 390 U.S. at 646. \nBut this distinction is immaterial: Operationally, to avoid \ncriminal conviction, New York retailers that sold mate-\nrial considered obscene for minors had to ascertain the \nage of the person buying it\u2014an assessment that could be \nmade by looking at the person or by requesting other \nproof of age. And the other main distinction between the \n\n21 \n \nNew York law and this one cuts in favor of H.B. 1181. \nWhereas the New York law was a criminal provision that \ncarried with it the risk of one year in prison, id. at 633 \nn.2, H.B. 1181 is a civil provision. Ginsberg thus applies \na fortiori. \nIndeed, H.B. 1181 addresses a situation remarkably \nsimilar to Sable: speech that is obscene and therefore un-\nprotected for one community (children) but\u2014argua-\nbly4\u2014not obscene and therefore protected for another \ncommunity (adults). To be even more precise, H.B. 1181 \naddresses speech that is unprotected for minors in \nTexas. Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code \u00a7129B.001(6). Thus, \nPetitioners can comply with H.B. 1181 by leaving the \nState\u2014as Pornhub has done. William Melhado, Pornhub \nSuspends Site in Texas Due to State\u2019s Age-Verification \nLaw, \nTex. \nTribune \n(Mar. \n14, \n2024), \nhttps://perma.cc/N9K6-W7CL. But \u201c[i]f a publisher \nchooses to send its material\u201d to Texas, \u201cthis Court\u2019s ju-\nrisprudence teaches that it is the publisher\u2019s responsibil-\nity to abide by that community\u2019s standards.\u201d Ashcroft I, \n535 U.S. at 583 (plurality op.) (following Sable, 492 U.S. \nat 125-26).   \n4.  None of the forgoing analysis changes merely be-\ncause H.B. 1181 addresses the internet\u2014not magazine \nstands. First Amendment principles \u201cdo[] not change be-\ncause the [interaction] has gone from the physical to the \nvirtual world.\u201d NetChoice, 144 S.Ct. at 2393. The gate-\nkeeping function performed by the 1960s shopkeeper is \nnow performed by websites using age-verification tech-\nnology. Notably, Sable did not involve a brick-and-mor-\ntar building, but this Court nonetheless held that if a \n \n4 In reality, much of the content on Petitioners\u2019 websites is ob-\nscene even as to adults. See supra pp.4-5; infra p.43.  \n\n22 \n \ncompany in the speech business wishes to operate na-\ntionally, it must adjust its \u201csystem\u201d to ensure that every \naudience member in each community may lawfully hear \nits message. Sable, 492 U.S. at 125. As Sable confirms, it \nis constitutionally irrelevant that such adjustments may \nrequire the company itself to \u201cscreen[]\u201d would-be cus-\ntomers, contract with a third party to do it, or leave the \nmarket. Id. Nor did the imposition of such \u201cburdens\u201d \ntrigger strict scrutiny. Contra Pet.Br.32. \nIt would be odd\u2014to say the least\u2014for this Court to \n(1) permit States to require speakers to serve as gate-\nkeepers for their own audiences without any additional \nscrutiny, see Sable, 492 U.S. at 126; and (2) cite Ginsberg \nfor the rule that States need only have a rational basis to \nrestrict minors\u2019 access to pornography, e.g., Erznoznik, \n422 U.S. at 212; yet (3) impose strict scrutiny on a re-\nquirement that pornographers take reasonable steps to \nensure their audiences don\u2019t include children. In fact, \nsuch a doctrine would not just be odd\u2014it would be inco-\nherent.    \nB. Petitioners\u2019 theories are unpersuasive. \nPetitioners disagree, but their theories overlook \nprecedent, misread precedent, or miss the point. Re-\ngardless, if Ashcroft II means what Petitioners say, the \nCourt should overrule it because it would contradict \nother precedent and rest on untrue factual premises. \n1. In challenging the Fifth Circuit\u2019s application of \nthe rational-basis standard, Petitioners insist (e.g., at 24-\n27) that because H.B. 1181 is a \u201ccontent-based\u201d re-\nstriction on speech, it must trigger strict scrutiny. Both \nthe major and the minor premise are wrong. This Court \nhas \u201creject[ed] \u2026 the view that any examination of \nspeech or expression inherently\u201d makes a law content \nbased and \u201ctriggers heightened First Amendment \n\n23 \n \nconcern.\u201d City of Austin v. Reagan Nat\u2019l Advert. of Aus-\ntin, LLC, 596 U.S. 61, 73 (2022). Moreover, though the \nCourt has applied strict scrutiny to some content-based \nrestrictions, e.g., United States v. Playboy Entm\u2019t Grp., \nInc., 529 U.S. 803, 813 (2000), many laws that in one \nsense are \u201ccontent based\u201d are not subject to strict scru-\ntiny, see, e.g., FCC v. Pacifica Found., 438 U.S. 726, 745 \n(1978) (plurality op.).  \nHere, H.B. 1181 is not a content-based restriction on \nprotected speech. It is a requirement that speakers serve \nas the gatekeeper when their speech is unprotected as to \ncertain listeners. Under cases like Sable, such a require-\nment is entirely permissible. And because H.B. 1181 in-\nvolves protecting minors from exposure to hardcore por-\nnography, it is subject to rational-basis scrutiny. \na. Contrary to Petitioners\u2019 view, not every regula-\ntion of expression that turns in some sense on content is \nsubject to strict scrutiny. To the contrary, \u201c[t]he ques-\ntion whether speech is[] or is not protected by the First \nAmendment often depends on the content of the speech.\u201d \nNew York v. Ferber, 458 U.S. 747, 763 (1982) (quoting \nAm. Mini Theatres, 427 U.S. at 66 (plurality op.)). One \ncannot tell if speech is unprotected incitement, defama-\ntion, a true threat, or integral to a crime without consid-\nering its content. See, e.g., Stevens, 559 U.S. at 468-69. \nRegulations of commercial speech, Zauderer v. Office of \nDisciplinary Counsel of Sup. Ct. of Ohio, 471 U.S. 626, \n638 (1985), and bans against solicitation, Heffron v. Int\u2019l \nSoc. for Krishna Consciousness, Inc., 452 U.S. 640, 647 \n(1981), similarly turn on content. Applying these well-es-\ntablished principles, H.B. 1181 is not a regulation of pro-\ntected speech but a law controlling access by a particular \ncommunity to unprotected speech. \n\n24 \n \nBecause it has always been understood that the First \nAmendment allows \u201crestrictions upon the content of \nspeech\u201d in these limited areas, restrictions limited to \nthose areas are not subject to strict scrutiny. Counter-\nman, 600 U.S. at 73 (quoting Stevens, 559 U.S. at 468). \nH.B. 1181 addresses perhaps the prototypical example of \nsuch an area of unprotected expression: materials that \nare obscene for minors. See, e.g., Stevens, 559 U.S. at 468-\n69. Because H.B. 1181 does nothing more than create a \nmechanism to distinguish between minors and adults\u2019 \nability to access materials that are not protected as to \nminors, it cannot be subject to strict scrutiny.5 \nb. Obscenity, which the Court has described as \u201cval-\nueless material,\u201d Counterman, 600 U.S. at 73, is one cat-\negory of \u201cspeech\u201d that is \u201cnot protected,\u201d Smith v. Cali-\nfornia, 361 U.S. 147, 152 (1959). \u201cAt the time of the adop-\ntion of the First Amendment, obscenity law was not as \nfully developed as libel law, but there is sufficiently con-\ntemporaneous evidence to show that obscenity, too, was \noutside the protection intended for speech and press.\u201d \nRoth v. United States, 354 U.S. 476, 483 & n.13 (1957); \nsee also id. at 485 n.17 (listing federal obscenity laws). \nAccordingly, the regulation or prohibition of obscenity is \nnot subject to strict scrutiny, even though one has to see \nit to know it. See, e.g., Hamling v. United States, 418 U.S. \n87 (1974) (criminalizing obscenity). Even the dissenters \nin Reagan agreed that governments may prohibit ob-\nscenity\u2014a \n\u201ccontent-based \nrestriction[]\u201d\u2014without \n \n5 Petitioners spill considerable ink (at 16-19) defending speech \nthat is (allegedly) not obscene as to minors or adults. It is unclear, \nhowever, how much of that speech Petitioners make. Because the \npreliminary-injunction record does not answer that question, this \npoint cannot support their facial challenge. See NetChoice, 144 S.Ct. \nat 2398-99. \n\n25 \n \nmeeting strict scrutiny. 596 U.S. at 87 n.1 (Thomas, J., \ndissenting). \nThis rule does not change merely because the line \nhere concerns obscenity for minors. Speech is generally \nconsidered obscene if the \u201caverage person, applying con-\ntemporary community standards,\u201d would conclude that \n\u201cthe work, taken as a whole, appeals to the prurient in-\nterest.\u201d Miller, 413 U.S. at 24. In determining whether a \ndepiction is or \u201cis not protected expression,\u201d govern-\nments can consider whether the audience comprises \nadults or children. Brown, 564 U.S. at 794 (discussing \nGinsberg). Accordingly, the fact that H.B. 1181 requires \nconsidering the content of speech to determine whether \nit is protected by the First Amendment as to minors does \nnot require the application of strict scrutiny. \n2. In arguing to the contrary, Petitioners point (at \n21-23) to Ashcroft II, Sable, Playboy, and Reno for the \nproposition that strict scrutiny applies to alleged bur-\ndens on adult access to speech even if that same speech \nis unprotected for minors. These cases, however, are in-\napposite because each involved a law that banned pro-\ntected speech for all listeners\u2014not, as H.B. 1181 does, \nrequire the speaker to serve as the gatekeeper to ensure \nthose individuals who have a constitutional right to do so \n(and only those individuals) can access the material. \na. The Fifth Circuit concluded that the Child Online \nProtection Act (COPA) at issue in Ashcroft II is the clos-\nest analog to H.B. 1181. Pet.App.16a. Like H.B. 1181, \nCOPA defined material that was \u201charmful to minors\u201d us-\ning the Miller standard. 542 U.S. at 661. But, unlike H.B. \n1181, COPA criminalized posting such information to the \ninternet for \u201ccommercial purposes.\u201d Id. COPA involved \nage verification in some sense, but only as an affirmative \ndefense: A criminal defendant could avoid liability by \n\n26 \n \nrestricting access to obscene-for-minors material by re-\nquiring, among other things, a credit card, adult access \ncode, digital age certificate, or measures feasible under \nexisting technology. Id. at 662.  \nAshcroft II is irrelevant here for at least three rea-\nsons.  \nFirst, COPA placed a greater burden on speech than \nH.B. 1181. It was a criminal statute that used age verifi-\ncation only as a defense, so there was no guarantee \nagainst prosecution. See, e.g., Ashcroft II, 542 U.S. at 674 \n(Stevens, J., concurring). Criminal statutes often require \ngreater scrutiny. See, e.g., City of Houston v. Hill, 482 \nU.S. 451, 459 (1987). By contrast, H.B. 1181 is a civil stat-\nute and so is not \u201cenforced by severe criminal penalties.\u201d \nAshcroft II, 542 U.S. at 660.   \nSecond, the Court did not purport to overrule Sable \nor to limit Ginsberg to brick-and-mortar shopping. In-\nstead, the Court barely addressed either case, and never \nmentioned the relevant portion of Sable addressing when \ngovernments can require speakers to act as gatekeepers. \nThe Court does not lightly toss aside foundational legal \nprinciples (as opposed to fact-heavy analysis), and cer-\ntainly did not do it without saying so. Further, the Court \nrecognized that the 5-year-old record did not \u201creflect \ncurrently technological reality.\u201d Id. at 671. Accordingly, \nfor case-specific reasons, age verification was seen as a \nmaterial burden rather than a manageable gatekeeping \nobligation. Here, by contrast, because of technological \nadvances, it is now far easier and less invasive to age ver-\nify; in fact, it can be done via software that does not even \nretain facial images. J.A.190-91. \nThird, as the Fifth Circuit explained, no one con-\ntested strict scrutiny\u2019s application in Ashcroft II. This \nCourt\u2019s rule \u201cin both civil and criminal cases\u201d is to \u201crely \n\n27 \n \non the parties to frame the issues for decision and assign \nto courts the role of neutral arbiter of matters the parties \npresent.\u201d Greenlaw v. United States, 554 U.S. 237, 243 \n(2008). In fact, \u201cour system is designed around the prem-\nise that parties represented by competent counsel know \nwhat is best for them, and are responsible for advancing \nthe facts and arguments entitling them to relief.\u201d United \nStates v. Sineneng-Smith, 590 U.S. 371, 375-76 (2020) \n(cleaned up). Because the government did not argue for \na lesser burden, the Court was not obligated to make an \nargument for it. Pet.App.19a. \nc. None of Petitioners\u2019 other three cases establish \nthat H.B. 1181 is subject to strict scrutiny.  \nFirst, Petitioners\u2019 reliance on Sable (at 21) is selec-\ntive. As explained above, Sable\u2019s gatekeeping analysis\u2014\nwhich Petitioners do not address\u2014squarely supports \nH.B. 1181. The Court in Sable also upheld an outright \nban on \u201cobscene\u201d telephone calls because \u201cprotection of \nthe First Amendment does not extend to obscene \nspeech.\u201d 492 U.S. at 124. Granted, the Court applied \nstrict scrutiny to the ban on \u201cindecent\u201d communications, \nnoting that \u201c[s]exual expression which is indecent but not \nobscene is protected by the First Amendment.\u201d Id. at \n126. Although the government attempted to justify the \ncomplete ban on indecent calls as necessary to protect \nminors, the Court recognized that other means were \navailable to vindicate that interest\u2014namely, requiring \nSable to screen its customers. Id. at 128. As that is what \nH.B. 1181 requires covered websites to do, it is hard to \nsee how Sable helps Petitioners. \nSecond, Playboy concerned what amounted to a ban \non speech that was not obscene. The Telecommunica-\ntions Act of 1996 required cable operators who provided \nchannels \u201cprimarily dedicated to sexually-oriented \n\n28 \n \nprogramming\u201d to scramble those channels or limit their \ntransmission to nighttime hours. 529 U.S. at 806. Rele-\nvant here, it was undisputed that the material at issue \nwas not obscene, and therefore that the law was a con-\ntent-based restriction on protected speech. Id. at 811-12. \nBecause scrambling was not guaranteed to be effective \ndue to signal bleed, most operators were effectively \nforced not to transmit such speech outside of nighttime \nhours. Id. at 806-07. This, in turn, prevented adults from \nviewing such materials for two-thirds of the day. Id. at \n812. Because the statute prohibited adults from viewing \nconstitutionally protected speech, this Court held it was \nsubject to strict scrutiny. Id. at 813. The Court did not \naddress whether the content at issue constituted obscen-\nity for children, let alone what the analysis would be for \na law that limited only children\u2019s right to access such ma-\nterials during daylight hours. \nThird, Reno concerned the Communications Decency \nAct (CDA), the \u201cbreadth\u201d of which was \u201cwholly unprece-\ndented.\u201d 521 U.S. at 877. The CDA criminalized the \nonline transmission of \u201cany comment, request, sugges-\ntion, proposal, image, or other communication which is \nobscene or indecent\u201d to someone known to be a minor. \nId. at 859 (emphasis added). In defining affected mate-\nrial, the CDA also prohibited \u201cpatently offensive\u201d com-\nmunications involving sexual activities and organs but \ndid not fully parrot the Court\u2019s obscenity precedent. Id. \nat 860. Thus, the CDA applied to far more speech than \nobscenity for minors. Further, because it applied \n\u201cbroadly to the entire universe of cyberspace,\u201d id. at 868, \nanyone posting had to assume a minor was present and \n\u201cin the absence of a viable age verification process\u201d cen-\nsor their speech accordingly, id. at 876.  \n\n29 \n \nTo the extent that Reno is relevant at all, it rebuts \nPetitioners\u2019 attempt to cabin Ginsberg (at 20-21, 30-31) \nas holding only that a State may define obscenity with \nrespect to minors. If that were true, Reno would have \nbeen much shorter. The Court would not have needed to \ndistinguish the CDA from the New York law in Ginsberg \nin at least four respects: the CDA (1) did not allow par-\nents to consent to the speech, (2) applied to non-commer-\ncial transactions, (3) used a much broader definition of \ncovered content, and (4) defined minors as those under \n18. 521 U.S. at 865-66. Instead, the Court could have \nsimply said Ginsberg answered a different question.  \nThe Fifth Circuit properly noted that at least three \nof the distinctions identified in Reno are inapplicable to \nH.B. 1181. Pet.App.13a-15a. Under H.B. 1181, so long as \nparents age verify themselves, they may allow their chil-\ndren to view any material on covered websites. See Tex. \nCiv. Prac. & Rem. Code \u00a7129B.002. H.B. 1181 applies \nonly to commercial entities whose websites contain more \nthan one-third harmful material. Id. \u00a7129B.002(a). H.B. \n1181 also closely follows the Court\u2019s definition of obscen-\nity. Id. \u00a7129B.001(6). And while H.B. 1181 defines minor \nas an individual under 18 rather than 17, id. \n\u00a7129B.001(3), that is a distinction without a difference \nhere, especially for a facial challenge. Thus, just as the \nReno Court distinguished the New York law in Ginsberg \nfrom the CDA, this Court should distinguish H.B. 1181 \nfrom the CDA. \nC. If Ashcroft II requires strict scrutiny, it \nshould be overruled. \nTexas does not believe that Ashcroft II requires ap-\nplication of strict scrutiny here. If the Court disagrees, \nhowever, so much the worse for Ashcroft II. Under Peti-\ntioners\u2019 theory, Ashcroft II ran roughshod over Sable \n\n30 \n \nand Ginsberg while creating an untenable distinction be-\ntween cyberspace and brick-and-mortar commerce\u2014\nsomething this Court refused to do in NetChoice. Doctri-\nnally, it makes no sense that a State can require an of-\nfline merchant to verify that a customer is not a child\u2014\u00e0 \nla Ginsberg\u2014but cannot do the same for an online mer-\nchant. After all, the same sort of (supposed) chill exists \nin either forum. E.g., Pet.App.11a (noting Petitioners\u2019 \nadmission). Yet this Court in Ginsberg and Sable allowed \nStates to place the burden on the speaker. \nFurthermore, the facts have changed markedly since \n2004\u2014a key reason to overrule precedent. See, e.g., Ja-\nnus v. Am. Fed\u2019n of State, Cnty., & Mun. Emps., Council \n31, 585 U.S. 878, 924-25 (2018). Although the federal gov-\nernment\u2019s decision not to challenge strict scrutiny in \nAshcroft II may seem strange in retrospect, given the in-\nfancy of the internet and the rudimentary technologies \nat issue, no one then credibly could have claimed that \nage-verification technology reliably and easily distin-\nguished adults from minors. Furthermore, online ob-\nscenity has grown much more dangerous for kids as the \nvolume, production quality, and algorithm usage in-\ncreases\u2014and will grow even more dangerous as AI be-\ncomes more entrenched. The world has changed.  \nII. H.B. 1181 Survives Any Level of Review. \nPetitioners do not argue that H.B. 1181 fails rational-\nbasis review, instead focusing on strict scrutiny. Even if \nheightened scrutiny applied, however, H.B. 1181 would \nclear it. At most, the standard would be intermediate \nscrutiny, but even under strict scrutiny, Texas has a com-\npelling interest and H.B. 1181 appropriately vindicates \nthat interest. Because \u201c[t]his Court \u2026 does not review \nlower courts\u2019 opinions, but their judgments,\u201d Jennings v. \n\n31 \n \nStephens, 574 U.S. 271, 277 (2015), the Court can affirm \non these bases as well.   \nA. At most, intermediate scrutiny applies. \n1. If the Court concludes that the Ginsberg/Sable \nrule does not govern, H.B. 1181 should be subject, at \nmost, to intermediate scrutiny. For decades, this Court \nhas recognized that States may protect children by cre-\nating adult-only spaces. After all, \u201c[t]he ease with which \nchildren may obtain access to broadcast material, cou-\npled with the concerns recognized in Ginsberg, amply \njustify special treatment of indecent broadcasting.\u201d \nPacifica, 438 U.S. at 750. As the internet further eases\u2014\nexponentially\u2014children\u2019s access to even more harmful \nvariations of such material, that rationale applies with \neven greater force. \nSimilar analysis is found in the Court\u2019s secondary-ef-\nfects doctrine. In City of Renton v. Playtime Theatres, \nInc., for example, the Court examined a zoning ordinance \nprohibiting adult theaters within 1,000 feet of residential \nzones, family dwellings, churches, parks, or schools. 475 \nU.S. 41, 54 (1986) (quoting Am. Mini Theatres, 427 U.S. \nat 71 (plurality op.)). Like other laws of its kind, applica-\ntion of the ordinance turned (at least in part) on the con-\ntent of the films. Id. at 47. Nevertheless, the Court con-\ncluded that the ordinance was not \u201caimed\u201d at that \u201ccon-\ntent\u201d but \u201crather at the secondary effects of such thea-\nters on the surrounding community.\u201d Id. (emphasis in \noriginal). Because the ordinance was \u201cjustified without \nreference to the content of the regulated speech,\u201d it was \ndeemed \u201ccontent-neutral.\u201d Id. at 48. Thus, the Court \nheld, it was constitutional as long as it was \u201cdesigned to \nserve a substantial governmental interest and allow[ed] \nfor reasonable alternative avenues of communication.\u201d \nId. at 50.  \n\n32 \n \n2. As Justice O\u2019Connor explained in Reno, efforts to \nregulate children\u2019s access to online pornography are best \nunderstood as attempts to translate Renton to cyber-\nspace. 521 U.S. at 889 (O\u2019Connor, J., concurring in part). \nDoing so was infeasible at the time because the internet \nof the 1990s lacked the two characteristics necessary \u201cto \ncreate \u2018adult zones\u2019\u201d: the power to sort by \u201cgeography \nand identity.\u201d Id. (citing Lawrence Lessig, Reading the \nConstitution in Cyberspace, 45 Emory L.J. 869, 886 \n(1996)). That is, \u201c[a] minor can see an adult dance show \nonly if he enters an establishment that provides such en-\ntertainment,\u201d yet that would be all but impossible to do \nbecause he could not \u201cconceal completely his identity (or, \nconsequently, his age).\u201d Id. Due to technological con-\nstraints, the same could not be said of the internet of the \n1990s and early 2000s. Id. \nBut the internet has fundamentally changed. It is \nnow possible \u201cto exclude persons from accessing certain \nmessages on the basis of their identity\u201d and to treat dif-\nferent jurisdictions differently. Id. at 890. Even apart \nfrom H.B. 1181, many websites use platforms like Yoti to \nage verify individuals. J.A.181. Websites can also distin-\nguish users by geography: Pornhub left the Texas mar-\nket after the Fifth Circuit stayed the district court\u2019s in-\njunction. Melhado, supra. And a host of websites age ver-\nify in jurisdictions all around the world. These facts \ndemonstrate that it is now possible to distinguish adults \nfrom minors and between physical locations online, mak-\ning Renton directly analogous. \n3. Petitioners do not dispute that H.B. 1181 serves a \nsubstantial\u2014indeed, compelling\u2014interest. Accordingly, \nbecause \u201creasonable alternative avenues of communica-\ntion\u201d remain open to Petitioners, Renton, 475 U.S. at 50, \nit follows that H.B. 1181 survives intermediate scrutiny. \n\n33 \n \nA restriction on videos of \u201cteen bondage gangbang[s],\u201d \nJ.A.176, does not \u201cinvade[] the area of freedom of expres-\nsion constitutionally secured to minors,\u201d Ginsberg, 390 \nU.S. at 637. And whether or not such materials can be \ndeemed \u201cartistic, informative, or even essential to im-\nportant parts of career and life,\u201d Pet.Br.1, Petitioners \nare free to produce, publish, and profit from as much of \nthem as the adult market can bear. Accordingly, their \nargument (at 35) that the Fifth Circuit erred in distin-\nguishing between outright bans on speech and burdens \nhas no place in the secondary-effects analysis. \nH.B. 1181 also does not discriminate against speech; \ninstead, content is considered for the sole purpose of de-\ntermining whether it is unprotected speech as to minors. \nH.B. 1181 is thus content neutral for the same reasons \nproducers of materials depicting \u201cactual sexually explicit \nconduct\u201d can be required to maintain records of their \nperformers\u2019 identities and ages to comply with a law de-\nsigned to prevent child pornography. Connection Dis-\ntrib. Co. v. Holder, 557 F.3d 321, 325, 328-29 (6th Cir. \n2009) (en banc).  \n4. Petitioners reject that intermediate scrutiny may \napply based on their misreading of Ashcroft II\u2014rebut-\nted above\u2014and separately (at 34-37) because H.B. 1181 \nsupposedly \u201cembodies speaker-based discrimination.\u201d \nThis latter argument reflects confusion. \nSpeaker-based distinctions are not inherently sus-\npect. For example, laws prohibiting speech integral to \ncriminal conduct do not unconstitutionally discriminate \nagainst would-be criminals because of the message they \nwish to convey. See, e.g., Giboney v. Empire Storage & \nIce Co., 336 U.S. 490, 498 (1949). And Petitioners\u2019 sug-\ngestion (at 35) that counsel for Texas\u2019s accurate charac-\nterization of their products means that legislation \n\n34 \n \nenacted by a different branch of government is subject \nto strict-scrutiny review is bewildering. Petitioners do \nnot dispute that content on their websites constitutes ob-\nscenity for children. Indeed, much of that content is also \nobscene for adults. See, e.g., supra pp.4-5; infra p.43. \nFurthermore, speaker-based discrimination impli-\ncates constitutional concerns only when the government \nuses it as a proxy for viewpoint-based discrimination. See \nR.A.V. v. City of St. Paul, 505 U.S. 377, 384 (1992). Laws \nsuch as H.B. 1181 regulating those who would otherwise \nspeak harmful and unprotected obscenity to minors do \nnot discriminate based on the speaker, but based on \nwhether the speech is protected in the first place.  \nPetitioners posit (at 35) that Texas\u2019s decision to ex-\nempt search engines or websites with less than one-third \nharmful content means the State has discriminated \nagainst the pornography industry. This is wrong for at \nleast four reasons.  \nFirst, Petitioners misunderstand Texas law: Search \nengines are exempt only to the extent they \u201cprovid[e] ac-\ncess or connection to or from\u201d a website that is not under \ntheir control. Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code \u00a7129B.005. If \na search engine operates\u2014or controls an entity that op-\nerates\u2014a website subject to H.B. 1181, it would no \nlonger be exempt. Id. Likewise and contrary to Petition-\ners\u2019 claim (at 35), social-media companies are not exempt \nfrom H.B. 1181 but must comply with it if they reach the \none-third threshold. Id. \u00a7129B.002(a).  \nSecond, Petitioners presume both that the subjective \nmotivation of a legislator is relevant to the constitutional \ninquiry and that such motivation can be determined \nwithout evidence. Both presumptions are mistaken. The \nburden of showing an improper legislative motive is a \n\u201cdemanding one,\u201d Easley v. Cromartie, 532 U.S. 234, 241 \n\n35 \n \n(2001), and \u201cthis Court will not strike down an otherwise \nconstitutional statute on the basis of an alleged illicit leg-\nislative motive,\u201d United States v. O\u2019Brien, 391 U.S. 367, \n383 (1968). \nThird, the Court has already held that governments \ncannot address the epidemic of online pornography\u2019s ef-\nfect on children by \u201cbroadly\u201d regulating \u201cthe entire uni-\nverse of cyberspace.\u201d Reno, 521 U.S. at 868. Given that \nholding, Texas\u2019s choice to regulate only those in the busi-\nness of distributing online obscenity is an effort to com-\nply with precedent\u2014not disregard it. Contra Pet.Br.28. \nIt is instead Petitioners who seek to evade precedent by \nexpanding the law of content- or speaker-based discrim-\nination such that it would render all laws governing un-\nprotected speech subject to strict scrutiny. \nFourth, Petitioners are wrong (at 36) that H.B. 1181\u2019s \nexemptions \u201cdefeat[] the law\u2019s avowed purpose.\u201d This ar-\ngument boils down to the view that H.B. 1181 is underin-\nclusive. Yet underinclusiveness is not fatal, else govern-\nments could only regulate in \u201cone fell swoop\u201d or not at \nall. Williams-Yulee, 575 U.S. at 449. Regardless, the idea \nthat a search engine is the same as Pornhub defies cre-\ndulity; Google has not embedded an addictive algorithm \nin its search function. Compare Adler, supra, at 811. And \na State surely can treat websites centered\u2014like a hub\u2014\naround pornography differently than those in which such \ncontent may appear but is hardly the focal point.  \nB. H.B. 1181 also survives strict scrutiny.  \nUltimately, the standard-of-scrutiny question is aca-\ndemic because H.B. 1181 satisfies even strict scrutiny.  \n1. H.B. 1181 serves a critical state interest. The \nCourt said as much in Sable and Petitioners do not con-\ntend otherwise. Rather, they concede (at 3) that Texas \nhas a compelling interest in the well-being of its children \n\n36 \n \nthat would permit regulation of Petitioners\u2019 speech even \nif subjected to strict scrutiny. For good reason. As this \nCourt recognized in Ginsberg, Texas has an independent \ninterest\u2014separate from that of a child\u2019s parents\u2014in the \nwell-being of the children within the State. 390 U.S. at \n640. And as the Fifth Circuit discussed, \u201cthe record is re-\nplete with examples of the sort of damage that access to \npornography does to children.\u201d Pet.App.26a.  \nEven in this preliminary stage of litigation, Texas of-\nfered evidence showing that children exposed to pornog-\nraphy exhibit \u201ca host of mental health afflictions\u201d includ-\ning depression, disassociation, and other behavioral \nproblems such as dating violence, emulating sexual \nstrangulation, and sexual coercion. J.A.160. They are \nalso more likely to use tobacco, alcohol, and drugs. \nJ.A.161. And as the Fifth Circuit observed, exposure to \npornography correlates with an increased likelihood chil-\ndren will view bestiality or child pornography. \nPet.App.26a. It is not by accident that nations all around \nthe world\u2014holding divergent views on a host of social \nconcerns\u2014agree that children should be not exposed to \nhardcore pornography.  \n \n2. H.B. 1181 is also narrowly tailored to the realities \nof today\u2019s increasingly digital world, where the dangers \nof unmonitored and surreptitious internet access by chil-\ndren is omnipresent. See, e.g., supra pp.8-9. In 1997, chil-\ndren could go online only at home or in a crowded venue \nsuch as a classroom or public library. Not so today. In-\nstead, \u201c53% of children have a smartphone by age 11,\u201d \nand \u201cover 95% of teens ages 13 to 17 years hav[e] access \nto a cell phone.\u201d Aliah Richter, et al., Youth Perspectives \non the Recommended Age of Mobile Phone Adoption: \nSurvey Study, 5(4) JMIR Pediatrics & Parenting 1 \n(2022). Even Amish communities worry about online \n\n37 \n \npornography. See, e.g., Kevin Granville & Ashley Gil-\nbertson, In Amish Country, the Future Is Calling, N.Y. \nTimes (Sept. 15, 2017), https://tinyurl.com/amishtimes. \nH.B. 1181 also is not \u201ca wholesale prohibition upon \nadult access to indecent speech.\u201d Sable, 492 U.S. at 132 \n(Scalia, J., concurring). Rather, it protects children from \nthat which is obscene by their standards, by requiring \nthe purveyors to check whether their viewers are chil-\ndren\u2014leaving adults able to access pornography by en-\ngaging in a process that they must complete potentially \nonly once and that applies equally to viewing pornogra-\nphy, buying wine, or renting a car. Supra pp.9-10. Alt-\nhough this requirement may impose a limited (if not de \nminimis) financial burden on Petitioners, they can decide \nhow to minimize that burden by choosing to contract for \nor handle verification themselves. Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. \nCode \u00a7129B.003; accord Sable, 492 U.S. at 125-26.  \n3. H.B. 1181 is also the least restrictive means to vin-\ndicate Texas\u2019s compelling interest. Because Texas may \nprotect children from exposure to obscenity, \u201cit neces-\nsarily follows that there must be a constitutional means \nof carrying it out.\u201d Glossip v. Gross, 576 U.S. 863, 869 \n(2015) (cleaned up). Requiring a speaker to check its own \ncustomers\u2019 ages is an appropriate means. Indeed, it is \ndifficult to see a better one. The nation has tried the al-\nternative\u2014content filtering\u2014for twenty years. It has \nnot worked. Texas thus may do the same thing that ju-\nrisdictions around the world are already doing.  \nNor is it a secret why content filtering fails. Filters \nonly work if they are consistently applied, but given the \nubiquity of internet-enabled computers, tablets, phones, \nwatches and even eyeglasses, consistent application is an \nimpossibility. A single child with an unfiltered device can \nexpose all his friends to the vilest obscenity, no matter \n\n38 \n \nthe content-filtering vigilance of other parents. In other \nwords, in a world where internet access is limited to \nclassrooms, libraries, and living rooms, it may be possi-\nble to rely on filters. But as jurisdictions around the \nglobe recognize, that hasn\u2019t been reality for years.      \nC. Petitioners\u2019 response fails.  \nPetitioners offer several contrary arguments, none of \nwhich is persuasive. \n \n1.  To start, Petitioners complain (at 38) that H.B. \n1181 is overinclusive because it applies to \u201can entire web-\nsite\u201d even if only one-third of the material is harmful. But \nif otherwise covered websites were to rigidly segregate \nobscene material, H.B. 1181 presumably would not ap-\nply.6 Like this Court, the Texas Supreme Court con-\nstrues statutes to avoid constitutional concerns. E.g., Os-\nterberg v. Peca, 12 S.W.3d 31, 51 (Tex. 2000). And it is \ncertainly possible to construe H.B. 1181 to allow entities \nto subdivide their content in such a way that no age ver-\nification would be required for a child-friendly website. \nBecause this is a pre-enforcement challenge, however, no \nstate court has had the opportunity to answer this ques-\ntion. Regardless, Petitioners have not attempted to \nprove that they, much less a substantial number of such \nwebsites, categorize their offerings that way. See infra \nPart III. \n2. Shifting gears, Petitioners also say (at 38-39) that \nH.B. 1181 is underinclusive because it is limited to web-\nsites that host a substantial amount of obscenity rather \n \n6 Petitioners\u2019 movie example (at 38) illustrates the point. If no \none makes sure that ticket buyers actually go only to their assigned \nscreen and stay there, a State absolutely could forbid a theater \nshowing hardcore obscenity on some screens from selling tickets to \n12-year-olds.   \n\n39 \n \nthan every website with such material. Putting aside the \n\u201csomewhat counterintuitive\u201d nature of arguing that H.B. \n1181 violates the First Amendment by failing to regulate \nmore speakers, \u201cthe First Amendment imposes no free-\nstanding \u2018underinclusiveness limitation.\u2019\u201d Williams-\nYulee, 575 U.S. at 449 (quoting R.A.V., 505 U.S. at 387). \nTexas thus \u201cneed not address all aspects of [the] problem \nin one fell swoop\u201d but instead \u201cmay focus on their most \npressing concerns.\u201d Id. Underinclusiveness is problem-\natic only when it serves as a proxy for viewpoint discrim-\nination. Id. Texas, however, has drawn reasonable\u2014and \nlong permitted\u2014lines.  \nOf course, Texas could have chosen to lower the \u201csex-\nual material harmful to minors\u201d content threshold from \none third of a commercial website\u2019s content, but doing so \nwould increase the burden on online speech, bringing it \ncloser to what was held unconstitutional in Reno, 521 \nU.S. at 877-78. Instead, H.B. 1181 applies to websites de-\nvoted to providing access to pornography. In the words \nof Williams-Yulee, 575 U.S. at 449, H.B. 1181 \u201caims \nsquarely at the conduct most likely to undermine\u201d the \nhealth of underage Texans: pornographic websites like \nthose run by the Petitioners. Applying Petitioners\u2019 logic, \nTexas would have to regulate either the entire internet, \nor none of it. But \u201c[t]he First Amendment does not put a \nState to that all-or-nothing choice.\u201d Id. at 452. This Court \nshould \u201cnot punish [Texas] for leaving open more, rather \nthan fewer, avenues of expression.\u201d Id.  \n3. Similarly without merit are Petitioners\u2019 conten-\ntions (at 39-41) that H.B. 1181 fails to use the least re-\nstrictive means. Petitioners insist (at 40-41) that because \nthis Court has stated a preference for content filtering \nover the primitive age-verification technologies in the \n1990s, Texas is forever limited to cajoling parents into \n\n40 \n \nusing filtering or requiring companies that provide inter-\nnet-enabled devices to employ it. Indeed, Petitioners \nlargely give up the game when they say (at 41 n.6) that \nthe States can require device manufacturers and inter-\nnet service providers to age verify, which would block at \nleast the same amount of content if not more. It is thus \nfar from clear that such filtering is less restrictive given \nit could lead to restriction of more content. At the very \nleast, Petitioners have failed to offer sufficient evidence \nto succeed on this ground facially. Infra Part III.  \nAssuming for argument\u2019s sake that content filtering \nis less restrictive, however, that does not answer the \nquestion. Content filtering has existed for decades, yet \nthe problem targeted by H.B. 1181\u2014childhood exposure \nto obscenity\u2014has gotten much worse. \u201cIt is always true, \nby definition, that the status quo is less restrictive than \na new regulatory law.\u201d Ashcroft II, 542 U.S. at 684 \n(Breyer, J., dissenting)). That is why the least-alterna-\ntive-means analysis requires the proposed alternative to \nbe \u201cat least as effective\u201d as the challenged provision. \nReno, 521 U.S. at 874 (emphasis added). As even the min-\nimal evidence available at this early stage confirms, de-\nspite its wide availability for decades, content filtering \n\u201chas proven an ineffective mechanism\u201d to limit \u201cexpo-\nsure to adult content by minors.\u201d J.A.207.  \nLeaning\u2014tellingly\u2014on an amicus brief, Petitioners \n(at 41) also raise the specter of Virtual Private Networks \n(VPNs). Petitioners point to the contention that \u201ctwenty \npercent of females and thirty-two percent of males be-\ntween the ages of sixteen and twenty-four\u201d use VPNs. \nICMEC.Cert.Br.12-13.7 That claim has not been tested \n \n7 Petitioners did not raise this statistic below, let alone address \nwhether VPN usage was predominantly by those between the ages \n \n\n41 \n \nin discovery, including whether such use is constant or \nsporadic. Even assuming it is true, however, that VPNs \nare used by young adults, that only undercuts Petition-\ners\u2019 argument that H.B. 1181 will do nothing to prevent \nchildren from being exposed to hardcore pornography. \nPre-pubescent children, for example, are particularly \ndrawn to hentai\u2014and there is no evidence they have ac-\ncess to VPNs. Regardless, even if an unknown percent-\nage of older minors (as opposed to young adults) in Texas \nconsistently use VPNs, amici\u2019s numbers suggest that \napproximately 70-80% or more may not be using VPNs. \nThat would powerfully recommend H.B. 1181\u2019s value in \nadvancing Texas\u2019s interest in protecting kids.  \n4. Petitioners and the district court also are wrong \nthat H.B. 1181 should be deemed something other than \nthe least restrictive means based on \u201cprivacy\u201d concerns. \nSpecifically, the district court worried \u201cthe state govern-\nment can log and track\u201d pornography access by imple-\nmenting age verification, Pet.App.125a, and Petitioners \necho that concern here (at 8-9). Nothing could be further \nfrom the truth. H.B. 1181 does not require adult pornog-\nraphy viewers to \u201caffirmatively identify themselves.\u201d \nPet.App.125a (emphasis added). Instead, they must only \ncorroborate their age through a method selected by Pe-\ntitioners. Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code \u00a7\u00a7129B.002-.003. \nAnd far from using age verification to track anyone, \nTexas has made the practice illegal. Id. \u00a7129B.002(b). \nH.B. 1181 thus does not require any record of the \u201cmost \nintimate and personal aspects of people\u2019s lives\u201d at which \nthe government could \u201cpeer,\u201d Pet.App.125a\u2014even if \nTexas wanted to (which it doesn\u2019t).     \n \nof 18 and 24. This argument thus is nowhere addressed in the Fifth \nCircuit\u2019s decision. \n\n42 \n \nIn sum, \u201c[t]he traditional power of government to fos-\nter good morals,\u201d especially those of kids, \u201cha[s] not been \nrepealed by the First Amendment.\u201d City of Erie v. Pap\u2019s \nA.M., 529 U.S. 277, 310 (2000) (Scalia, J., concurring). \nH.B. 1181 is Texas\u2019s attempt to protect children from ob-\nscenity without depriving adults of the choice to view \nsuch material. This Court \u201cshould not hastily dismiss the \njudgment of legislators, who may be in a better position \n\u2026 to assess the implications of new technology.\u201d Brown, \n564 U.S. at 806 (Alito, J., concurring). \nIII. H.B. 1181 is Not Facially Unconstitutional. \nEven putting aside the forgoing, the district court\u2019s \nanalysis of this facial challenge cannot possibly be rec-\nonciled with NetChoice.  \nA. Petitioners are not entitled to facial relief. \n1. As the Court explained in NetChoice, facial chal-\nlenges \u201ccome[] at a cost.\u201d 144 S.Ct. at 2397. Not only \nmust courts consider whether \u201cheartland\u201d applications \nare unconstitutional, but also whether \u201ca substantial \nnumber\u201d of the whole universe of \u201capplications are un-\nconstitutional, judged in relation to the statute\u2019s plainly \nlegitimate sweep.\u201d Id. In other words, plaintiffs must \nshow that \u201ca law\u2019s unconstitutional applications\u201d are \n\u201csubstantially disproportionate.\u201d United States v. Han-\nsen, 599 U.S. 762, 770 (2023). Absent a \u201clopsided ratio,\u201d \n\u201ccourts must handle unconstitutional applications as \nthey usually do\u2014case-by-case.\u201d Id.  \nThe Court reiterated this analysis in United States v. \nRahimi. Rather than focusing on \u201cthe circumstances in \nwhich\u201d a law \u201cwas most likely to be constitutional,\u201d the \nlower court \u201cfocused on hypothetical scenarios where [it] \nmight raise constitutional concerns.\u201d 144 S.Ct. 1889, 1903 \n(2024). But that was \u201cslaying a straw man.\u201d Id. Although \n\n43 \n \nRahimi arose in the Second rather than First Amend-\nment context, the Court\u2019s rejection of \u201chypothetical\u201d sce-\nnarios is also a familiar feature of First Amendment law. \nSee, e.g., Hansen, 599 U.S. at 786 (Thomas, J., concur-\nring) (citing Broadrick, 413 U.S. at 610-11).    \n2. Here, the district court\u2019s facial analysis is defi-\ncient in numerous respects.  \nFirst, the preliminary-injunction record does not re-\nflect how much of the material on Petitioners\u2019 websites is \nalso obscene for adults. As demonstrated above, see su-\npra pp.4-5, the answer to this question is \u201ca lot.\u201d Because \na substantial portion of the content is obscene, it receives \nno First Amendment protection\u2014no matter who is look-\ning. See Counterman, 600 U.S. at 73. If graphic displays \nof \u201cmouth spreaders,\u201d J.A.176, and much else besides, do \nnot satisfy the Miller standard, nothing does.   \nThe district court refused to consider such content (of \nwhich there are petabytes), instead focusing on media \nlike Netflix films. ROA.1877-81. In so doing, it failed \nNetChoice two times over. Not only did it fail to consider \nthe whole universe of applications, but it did not even \nconsider those applications within H.B. 1181\u2019s heartland.  \nSecond, \u201c[t]o justify facial invalidation, a law\u2019s uncon-\nstitutional applications must be realistic, not fanciful.\u201d \nHansen, 599 U.S. at 770. Rather than providing specific \nreal-world examples, however, Petitioners imagine (at \n38) a website in which 35% of the content is harmful to \nminors and 65% is protected political speech. Should \nsuch a unique website exist, it may attempt to bring an \nas-applied challenge, although that challenge would fail \nunder the Ginsberg/Sable rule. But the possibility that \nsuch a site might exist does not show that a \u201csubstantial \nnumber of [H.B. 1181\u2019s] applications are uncon-\n\n44 \n \nstitutional.\u201d NetChoice, 144 S.Ct. at 2397. The district \ncourt committed a similar error. Pet.App.115a. \nThird, Petitioners did not offer evidence of the bur-\nden on adults they hypothesize. Nothing in the record \ndemonstrates that fear of hypothetical hacking of age-\nverification websites has chilled anyone from visiting any \nwebsite\u2014whether it be to access pornography or any of \nthe other services that require such verification. Supra \npp.9-10. There certainly is no evidence that H.B. 1181 \nhas increased the risk of exposure over the status quo. \nFor example, because some Petitioners operate sub-\nscription-based websites, an individual\u2019s credit-card in-\nformation is already subject to hacking. ROA.250-51. \nMore broadly, \u201c[m]odern cell phones are not just another \ntechnological convenience\u201d but instead \u201chold for many \nAmericans the privacies of life.\u201d Riley v. California, 573 \nU.S. 373, 403 (2014) (citation omitted). Thus, a misplaced \nphone containing \u201c[a]n Internet search and browsing his-\ntory \u2026 could reveal an individual\u2019s private interests or \nconcerns.\u201d Id. at 395. There is no evidence that age veri-\nfication materially increases the risk of privacy violations \nabove what already exists for anyone living in the mod-\nern world\u2014and certainly not in a lopsided number of \ncases.  \nB. Petitioners\u2019 response again fails. \nPetitioners\u2019 attempt (at 24-25, 41-43) to preemptively \nrebut Texas\u2019s argument only underscores why a facial in-\njunction is unwarranted.  \nPetitioners first suggest (at 25) that Texas conceded \nat oral argument that Petitioners\u2019 sites do not contain \nmaterial that is obscene for adults. Not so. Counsel said \nthat H.B. 1181 does not restrict an adult\u2019s access to any \nof the content on Petitioners\u2019 sites. Oral Argument,  \nNo. \n23-50627 \n(Oct. \n4, \n2023) \nat \n13:35-14:10, \n\n45 \n \nhttps://bit.ly/4c5B42K. That statement is correct for the \nreasons discussed at length above. It does not follow, \nhowever, that the material is not obscene.  \nThey next argue (at 24, 42) that Texas elsewhere \ncriminalizes obscenity. That is a non sequitur. For any \nsupposed \u201cchill\u201d argument to succeed, the content on Pe-\ntitioners\u2019 websites must be constitutionally protected. \nThat is a question of federal constitutional law\u2014not \nTexas statutory law. Because no one has a First Amend-\nment right to view much of the content on Petitioners\u2019 \nsites, it is beside the point whether Texas has decided not \nto bar adults from viewing that content as part of this \nstatute. What matters is Petitioners cannot leverage the \nFirst Amendment to attack a state law by complaining \nthat some adults might be chilled from viewing content \nthey have no constitutional right to view.8   \nPetitioners also observe (at 42) that this Court af-\nfirmed facial preliminary injunctions in Ashcroft II and \nReno. But the Court did not conduct facial analysis in \nAshcroft II\u2014indeed, neither the word \u201cfacial\u201d or \u201cface\u201d \nis used in the opinion. And in Reno, the statute was ex-\ntraordinarily broad. See supra p.28-29. Not so here. The \nfacts are also different; because age-verification is now \n \n8 Petitioners overread (at 24-25) Reno and Ashcroft v. Free \nSpeech Coalition, 535 U.S. 234 (2002), to suggest that the Court \nshould ignore obscenity on their websites. In Free Speech Coalition, \nthe Court addressed a statute that sought \u201cto reach beyond obscen-\nity\u201d and made \u201cno attempt to conform to the Miller standard.\u201d 535 \nU.S. at 240. It covered a wide swath of materials that were not ob-\nscene for anyone and was backed by criminal penalties. Id. at 244, \n246-47. By contrast, H.B. 1181 tracks the Miller standard, ad-\ndresses websites containing an extraordinary volume of obscenity \nfor anyone, and is civil. And in Reno, the Court observed that the \nCDA covered extraordinary amounts of \u201cindecent\u201d but non-obscene \ncontent. 521 U.S. at 871. That is not the situation here.   \n\n46 \n \ncommon across many industries and modern technology \nensures privacy, any notion that a sufficiently large num-\nber of adults may be chilled is not credible.    \nPetitioners assert too (at 42) that \u201cthere are no dis-\ntinctions among covered websites that entitle some to \ngreater constitutional protection than others.\u201d That is \npure question begging. If content on some but not all \nsites is obscene even for adults, then there would be a \n\u201cdistinction\u201d across sites. The district court, however, \nfailed to conduct the required analysis.  \nFinally, Petitioners repeatedly suggest (e.g., 1, 6, 24) \nthat H.B. 1181 captures essentially everything because \nit protects young children, too. Texas, however, did the \nsame thing that New York did in Ginsberg\u2014it took this \nCourt\u2019s obscenity standard and applied it to children. Pe-\ntitioners, however, do not claim that New York\u2019s law \ntherefore captured ordinary \u201csex education content.\u201d \nContra Pet.Br.7. It is beyond implausible that Texas \ncourts will construe H.B. 1181 in such a manner, even \nmore so because such content presumably would not be \n\u201cprurient\u201d and would have \u201cserious \u2026 scientific value for \nminors,\u201d Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code \u00a7129B.001(6); see \nalso Ashcroft I, 535 U.S. at 579 & nn.9-10 (plurality op.). \nRegardless, such issues should be resolved in as-applied \nchallenges. And Petitioners\u2019 suggestion (at 27) that those \nwithout identification will suffer is a red herring. Age-\nverification technology does not require government \nidentification, supra pp.9-10, and even if it did, such an \nargument could be the subject of an as-applied suit. \nIV. Petitioners Flunk the Remaining Factors. \nBecause Petitioners are unlikely to succeed on the \nmerits, this Court need go no further. Winter, 555 U.S. \nat 32-33. Even if Petitioners had made that showing, they \nwould not be entitled to a preliminary injunction.   \n\n47 \n \nFirst, Petitioners have not shown \u201c[p]erhaps the sin-\ngle most important prerequisite for\u201d interim relief\u2014that \nthey are \u201clikely to suffer irreparable harm before a deci-\nsion on the merits can be rendered.\u201d 11A Charles Alan \nWright & Arthur R. Miller, Federal Practice & Proce-\ndure \u00a72948.1 (3d ed. Apr. 2023 update). Before the dis-\ntrict court, Petitioners pointed to no evidence that age \nverification has chilled any actual person from accessing \nany website. Nor could they because (1) age verification \nis already a hallmark of many industries, (2) that some-\none has been age verified says nothing about whether \nthat person views pornography, (3) H.B. 1181 forbids \ncovered websites from preserving identifying infor-\nmation, and, (4) regardless, countless adults pay to ac-\ncess Petitioners\u2019 websites with credit cards. It is not \nenough for Petitioners to wave the \u201cchill\u201d flag\u2014they \nneed to prove it. Nor can they rely on compliance costs \nwhen Pornhub and other such websites already have age \nverification built into their systems.     \nSecond, Texas\u2014and millions of children in Texas\u2014\nwill suffer irreparable harm if H.B. 1181 is enjoined, \nwhich has profound consequences for the public interest. \n\u201cAny time a State is enjoined by a court from effectuat-\ning statutes enacted by representatives of its people, it \nsuffers a form of irreparable injury.\u201d Maryland v. King, \n567 U.S. 1301, 1303 (2012). But the harm here is even \nmore significant. H.B. 1181 addresses an ongoing crisis. \nAccord United States v. Morrison, 529 U.S. 598, 614 \n(2000) (noting the \u201cnumerous findings regarding the se-\nrious impact that gender-motivated violence has on vic-\ntims and their families\u201d). Texas is not powerless to ad-\ndress that crisis. The Court thus should again leave the \nstatus quo in place while this litigation continues.   \n\n48 \n \nCONCLUSION \nThe Court should affirm the Fifth Circuit\u2019s judgment.   \nRespectfully submitted. \nKEN PAXTON \nAttorney General of Texas \nBRENT WEBSTER \nFirst Assistant Attorney \n  General \nOFFICE OF THE  \n  ATTORNEY GENERAL \nP.O.

          "task_beliefs": "My understanding of this case has progressed from a general identification of the legal question to a detailed map of the petitioners' legal strategy. I know the central conflict is whether Texas H.B. 1181, which mandates age verification for websites with substantial \"sexual material harmful to minors,\" should be judged by \"strict scrutiny\" or \"rational basis\" review. The choice of standard is the pivotal factor in determining the law's constitutionality.\n\nFrom the petitioners' brief, I have a stable and comprehensive model of their argument. They assert that a clear and modern line of Supreme Court precedent\u2014*Sable*, *Reno*, *Playboy*, and especially *Ashcroft v. ACLU* (2004)\u2014mandates strict scrutiny for any law that imposes a significant burden on adults' access to speech that is constitutionally protected for them. They argue the Fifth Circuit erred by reverting to the older *Ginsberg* precedent, which concerns the distinct issue of minors' rights, rather than the burdens placed on adults. The petitioners' case is structured around several key points: the law fails strict scrutiny because it is both overinclusive (banning R-rated movies) and underinclusive (exempting search engines), less restrictive alternatives like content filters exist (as endorsed in *Ashcroft*), the verification methods create a chilling effect due to privacy concerns, and the law constitutes impermissible speaker-based discrimination.\n\nThis latest observation, an internal reasoning step, has not introduced new external facts but has been crucial for consolidating my knowledge. It confirms that my model of the petitioners' argument is robust. More importantly, it has allowed me to precisely define the boundary of my uncertainty. My focus is no longer on understanding the petitioners' position, but has now shifted entirely to the respondent. The central, unresolved question is: How will Texas defend the Fifth Circuit's decision? Specifically, what legal theory will they use to argue that the *Sable-Reno-Playboy-Ashcroft* line of cases is inapplicable, and that the much lower bar of rational basis review is appropriate? My predictive model is now waiting for this critical input.",
          "design_beliefs": "My strategic framework for legal analysis continues to evolve from foundational principles to a more refined, multi-step methodology. I began with the basics: identify the core legal question and the dispositive nature of the standard of review in First Amendment cases. My initial heuristic to read the petitioner's brief first proved highly effective.\n\nThat success led me to develop more sophisticated principles:\n1.  **Leverage Internal Structure:** Use a brief's \"Table of Authorities\" as a high-speed tool to map the key precedents.\n2.  **Identify Argumentative Patterns:** Recognize the powerful strategy of framing a lower court decision as a \"radical departure\" from established Supreme Court doctrine, as it appeals to the Court's interest in consistency.\n3.  **Map Competing Precedents:** Frame the dispute as a contest between competing lines of cases (e.g., the petitioners' *Sable-Ashcroft* chain vs. a likely reliance on *Ginsberg* by the respondent).\n4.  **Adopt a Dialectical Approach:** The most efficient information-gathering sequence is dialectical: Petitioner's Brief \u2192 Respondent's Brief \u2192 Petitioner's Reply Brief. This mirrors the adversarial process and builds a balanced understanding.\n\nThis most recent observation, a `THINK` action, has validated this dialectical approach and introduced a new, explicit meta-heuristic into my design. I now see the value of a \"Consolidate and Plan\" step. After processing a major piece of evidence, it is a highly effective design principle to pause and internally reason. This step allows me to: (a) crystallize the knowledge gained into a stable model, (b) explicitly articulate the remaining uncertainty, and (c) formulate the next action to target that specific uncertainty. This meta-cognitive loop (Observe \u2192 Synthesize \u2192 Plan) is a crucial component for ensuring that my information gathering is efficient and purposeful, directly serving the goal of reducing predictive uncertainty. My next action, seeking the respondent's brief, is a direct consequence of this refined process."

The petitioner's reply brief is the single most valuable piece of information to acquire next, as it is specifically designed to rebut the respondent's arguments. It will reveal how the petitioners counter the claim that technology has rendered *Ashcroft II* obsolete and how they distinguish *Ginsberg*. This directly addresses the central uncertainty in my predictive model, which has moved from identifying arguments to weighing them. \n\nDesign EIG (0.8): This action serves as the capstone for my dialectical analysis strategy (Petitioner -> Respondent -> Reply). It will provide a concrete example of how to rebut the sophisticated argumentative structures I just identified in the respondent's brief, such as the 'hierarchy of fallbacks' (Principle 6) and the 'changed circumstances' argument (Principle 3).

          "task_beliefs": "My model of this case has now advanced to a comprehensive, dialectical understanding of the central legal conflict. My prior knowledge, built from the petitioners' brief, established their core argument: a consistent line of Supreme Court precedent from *Sable* through *Reno*, *Playboy*, and *Ashcroft v. ACLU* (2004) mandates strict scrutiny for any law, like Texas H.B. 1181, that imposes a significant burden on adults' access to constitutionally protected speech. My primary uncertainty was how Texas would defend the Fifth Circuit's application of the much lower \"rational basis\" standard.\n\nThe respondent's brief has directly and completely answered this question, filling the critical gap in my predictive model. Texas's strategy is multi-layered and aggressive.\n1.  **Primacy of *Ginsberg*:** The core of their argument is that *Ginsberg v. New York* (1968) is the controlling precedent. They argue *Ginsberg* established that states have the power to protect children from material that is harmful to them (but not obscene for adults) and that such laws are subject only to rational basis review. They frame the issue not as a burden on adult speech, but as a straightforward application of *Ginsberg*'s \"variable obscenity\" doctrine to the internet.\n2.  **Neutralizing the *Sable-Ashcroft* Precedents:** Texas directly confronts the petitioners' precedents by arguing they were products of a specific technological era. They contend that cases like *Reno* and *Ashcroft II* found fault with previous laws because of *technological limitations* that made it impossible to shield minors without unconstitutionally burdening adults. Their key assertion is that technology has now evolved, and \"commercially reasonable\" age verification is a feasible and effective means, thus rendering the technological concerns of *Ashcroft II* obsolete.\n3.  **A Hierarchy of Fallback Arguments:** The brief reveals a sophisticated defensive structure. If the Court rejects rational basis, Texas argues:\n    *   **(a) Intermediate Scrutiny:** At most, intermediate scrutiny should apply.\n    *   **(b) Surviving Strict Scrutiny:** Even if strict scrutiny is applied, the law survives because the state's interest in protecting children from the documented psychological and behavioral harms of modern, algorithmically-driven pornography is exceptionally compelling, and age verification is the most narrowly tailored means to achieve it.\n    *   **(c) Overruling Precedent:** In a bold move, they explicitly state that if *Ashcroft II* is interpreted to require strict scrutiny in this context, it should be overruled. This signals an appeal to the current Court's potential willingness to reconsider past rulings.\n4.  **Factual and Procedural Framing:** Texas dedicates significant space to describing the graphic, violent, and psychologically damaging nature of the content on petitioners' websites, framing the case as a public health crisis rather than an abstract speech issue. They also mount a procedural attack, arguing that a facial, pre-enforcement injunction is improper because the law has a \"plainly legitimate sweep\" in regulating content that is obscene even for adults, and thus unprotected by the First Amendment for anyone.\n\nMy predictive model is no longer about discovering the arguments but about weighing them. The case is now clearly framed as a contest: Does the *Sable-Ashcroft* line protecting adult access control, or does the *Ginsberg* principle of protecting minors, now enabled by new technology, take precedence? The Court's decision will likely depend on its view of technological feasibility and its willingness to revisit or distinguish the holding of *Ashcroft II*.",
          "design_beliefs": "My strategic framework for legal analysis has been significantly validated and refined by this observation. The process of building a model of one side's argument and then using that model to target the opponent's brief has proven exceptionally efficient.\n\nMy core design principles have evolved and now include:\n1.  **Leverage Internal Structure:** Continue to use a brief's \"Table of Authorities\" and \"Table of Contents\" as a high-speed tool to map key precedents and argumentative structure.\n2.  **Identify Argumentative Patterns:** Recognize the power of framing a lower court decision as either a \"radical departure\" from precedent (petitioner's strategy) or a simple application of older, foundational precedent to new facts (respondent's strategy).\n3.  **Map Competing Precedents:** Frame the dispute as a contest between competing lines of cases (*Sable-Ashcroft* vs. *Ginsberg*). This observation adds a crucial new sub-principle: **Look for \"changed circumstances\" arguments (e.g., technological evolution) that attempt to re-contextualize or render obsolete a key precedent.** Texas's argument that new technology moots the concerns of *Ashcroft II* is a perfect example of this powerful technique.\n4.  **Adopt a Dialectical Approach:** The sequence of Petitioner's Brief \u2192 Respondent's Brief \u2192 Petitioner's Reply Brief is confirmed as the most effective and efficient information-gathering methodology. It mirrors the adversarial process and systematically reduces uncertainty.\n5.  **Employ a \"Consolidate and Plan\" Meta-Heuristic:** The value of pausing after a major observation to synthesize knowledge, articulate remaining uncertainty, and plan the next action is reaffirmed. My previous planning step led directly to this highly informative observation.\n6.  **Deconstruct Argumentative Hierarchies (New Principle):** This observation has taught me to explicitly identify and map the hierarchy of legal arguments. A strong brief presents a primary claim (e.g., \"rational basis applies\"), but also includes layered fallbacks (\"if not rational basis, then we survive intermediate scrutiny,\" \"even if strict scrutiny applies, we still win\") and sometimes a \"nuclear option\" (\"overrule the precedent\"). Mapping this structure is critical for understanding the arguer's strategic depth and assessing the robustness of their position.\n7.  **Analyze Framing as a Core Strategy (New Principle):** The respondent's brief demonstrates that the Introduction and Statement of Facts are not mere formalities. They are a crucial persuasive tool used to frame the case in a specific emotional and factual context (e.g., public health crisis vs. censorship). Future analysis must treat this framing as a key part of the legal strategy itself. My next action will be to seek the petitioners' reply brief to see how they counter this multi-layered defense."

        "current_beliefs": {
          "task_beliefs": "My model of this case remains centered on the fundamental legal clash I identified previously: the petitioners' reliance on the *Sable-Ashcroft* line of precedents protecting adult access to speech versus the respondent's (Texas's) assertion that *Ginsberg v. New York*, enabled by modern technology, is the controlling authority for protecting minors. My understanding of the respondent's multi-layered defense\u2014prioritizing rational basis review, offering intermediate and strict scrutiny survival as fallbacks, and even suggesting overruling *Ashcroft II*\u2014is stable.\n\nThe latest observation did not deliver the petitioner's reply brief as anticipated, and thus did not resolve my primary uncertainty: how the petitioners will counter Texas's technologically-focused argument that the concerns of *Ashcroft II* are now obsolete. However, the observation provided crucial procedural information that directly impacts my predictive timeline.\n\n1.  **Timeline Clarification:** I now know that the petitioner's reply brief was not filed by its original December 16, 2024 deadline. The petitioners requested and were granted a consent-based extension.\n2.  **New Filing Date:** The reply brief is now expected on or before December 23, 2024. This pinpoints the exact date when the final piece of pre-argument briefing will become available.\n3.  **Oral Argument Confirmation:** The observation confirms the oral argument is set for January 15, 2025. This means the Justices will have approximately three weeks with the complete set of briefs before hearing the case, a standard and sufficient timeframe.\n4.  **Litigation Tenor:** The fact that Texas consented to the extension request is a minor but relevant data point, suggesting a degree of professional courtesy between the parties rather than a highly acrimonious procedural battle.\n\nIn essence, my substantive legal model of the case is unchanged. The central conflict remains a battle between two lines of precedent, with the Court's view on technological feasibility and its willingness to distinguish or revisit *Ashcroft II* as the likely determinative factor. The new information is purely procedural, but it is critical for planning, as it tells me precisely when I can expect to acquire the information needed to complete my dialectical analysis of the arguments.",
          "design_beliefs": "This observation, while not substantively rich, has provided a crucial lesson in the practical execution of legal analysis, leading to significant refinements in my strategic framework. My core principles have been tested and strengthened.\n\n1.  **Leverage Internal Structure:** Remains a valid and efficient first-pass analysis tool for any major brief.\n2.  **Identify Argumentative Patterns:** The \"radical departure\" vs. \"foundational precedent\" framing remains a key pattern to identify.\n3.  **Map Competing Precedents:** The strategy of framing a case as a contest between lines of precedent (*Sable-Ashcroft* vs. *Ginsberg*) and looking for \"changed circumstances\" arguments (like technological evolution) is reaffirmed as a powerful analytical method.\n4.  **Adopt a Dialectical Approach:** This core methodology (Petitioner \u2192 Respondent \u2192 Reply) is still the most effective path. However, this observation adds a critical tactical layer: **Verify procedural timelines.** The failure to retrieve the reply brief demonstrates that the logical next step in an argument may not yet exist in reality. Future actions must incorporate a check of the case docket for filing dates, extensions, and scheduling orders before attempting to retrieve a document.\n5.  **Employ a \"Consolidate and Plan\" Meta-Heuristic:** This principle is reinforced. My plan to seek the reply brief was correct, but its execution was premature. The learning is to integrate timeline verification into the planning step.\n6.  **Deconstruct Argumentative Hierarchies:** The strategy of mapping a brief's primary, fallback, and \"nuclear\" options remains a critical tool for assessing an argument's depth and resilience.\n7.  **Analyze Framing as a Core Strategy:** The importance of analyzing the Introduction and Statement of Facts as persuasive framing devices is unchanged.\n8.  **Interpret Procedural Filings as Structural Data (New Principle):** This is the most significant new learning from this observation. I had previously focused exclusively on substantively rich documents. I now understand that procedural filings, such as this application for a time extension, are not noise. They are a valuable source of \"structural data\" that provides:\n    *   **Authoritative Timelines:** They establish firm dates for past and future filings.\n    *   **Event Confirmation:** They verify key events, such as when prior briefs were filed.\n    *   **Scheduling Insight:** They provide dates for major events like oral arguments.\n    *   **Contextual Clues:** They can offer subtle information about the relationship between parties (e.g., consent to a motion).\n    My methodology must now include the analysis of these documents to build a complete and practical model of a case's progression, preventing wasted actions and providing a more robust operational context."

ACLU (Ashcroft II), 542 U.S. 656 (2004), \nthe \nCourt \nconsidered \na \ncontent-based \nspeech \nrestriction on sexually explicit materials on the \nInternet that Congress deemed harmful to minors. In \nconsidering this question, the Court assumed that \ncertain protected speech may be regulated, with the \nkey consideration being determining the least \nrestrictive alternative that can be used to achieve that \ngoal. In Ashcroft II, blocking and filtering software \nwas found to be the least restrictive alternative. In \nthis case, age verification technology is proposed as \nthe least restrictive alternative to achieving Texas\u2019s \nuncontested goal of protecting minors from obscene \ncontent on the Internet. \nThe Court in Ashcroft II conducted an in-depth \nanalysis of the viability and effectiveness of filtering \nsoftware circa February 1999\u2014over 25 years ago. The \nCourt found that this technological solution was the \nleast restrictive means of regulating Internet \nobscenity, with the crucial caveat that \u201cit is \nreasonable to assume that other technological \ndevelopments important to the First Amendment \nanalysis have also occurred during that time.\u201d Id. at \n671. \nThis \namicus \nbrief \nis \nabout \n\u201ctechnological \ndevelopments important to the First Amendment \nanalysis,\u201d acknowledging the Court\u2019s finding that \u201cthe \ntechnology of the Internet evolves at a rapid pace.\u201d Id. \nIn this case, the District Court soundly rejected age \nverification technology in favor of content filtering \nsoftware, while the Fifth Circuit held that Texas\u2019s \n\n \n4 \n\u201cage \nverification \nrequirement \nlikely \npasses \nconstitutional \nmuster \nunder \nthe \nrational-basis \nstandard in Ginsberg.\u201d Pet.App.27a. \nUnderstanding \nage \nverification \ntechnologies \nis \nessential to deciding whether their application is the \nleast \nrestrictive \nalternative \nunder \nthe \nFirst \nAmendment. \nARGUMENT \nI. \nAge Verification Technology is the Least \nRestrictive Alternative and is Narrowly \nTailored to Achieve Texas\u2019s Well-Founded \nGoal of Protecting Minors from Obscene \nContent on the Internet \nThis brief outlines practical examples of how current \nage verification technology (also known as age \nassurance technology) is working today, focusing on \nartificial intelligence (AI) driven facial age estimation. \nAI facial age estimation is the most popular age \nverification technology with individuals and the most \nprevalent approach by volume. It does not require \nusing an identity document or other identity data, nor \ndoes it require using facial recognition technology. No \ndatabase is created; no images are stored. The \nalgorithm does not learn anything from each \nadditional age check undertaken. \nYoti Ltd., a worldwide leader in age verification, offers \na wide range of approaches, and has undertaken over \n700 million age checks. Yoti is therefore uniquely \nqualified to explain the ease of use, accuracy, \naffordability, security, effectiveness, and accessibility, \nincluding details on how AI-driven facial age \n\n \n5 \nestimation \nmeets \nrigorous \ndata \nprotection \nrequirements to preserve privacy. This brief details \nexamples of how and where this low-friction \ntechnology is already operating globally at scale with \nleading web platforms. \nEvery month, AI-driven facial age estimation \ntechnology already enables tens of millions of adults \nto verify their age in about one second. The facial \nimage is not stored and there is no reliance on any \nidentity documentation. This technology enables \nplatforms to easily distinguish an adult from a minor \nat a global scale and in the volumes required for global \nplatforms such as Meta. \nWith the user\u2019s consent, Yoti can store the results of a \npreviously completed facial age estimation on the \nuser\u2019s device as a reusable digital ID or wallet. This \ndigital ID or wallet can then be utilized to access any \nwebsite containing adult content. \nTaking this technology one step further, reusable \napproaches, termed \u2018tokens,\u2019 are now available so \nrepeat visitors to an age-gated website, such as adult \ncontent websites, can prove their age once and then \ncontinue to use the generated age verification token \nindefinitely. The French government is the first \ngovernment to issue guidelines authorizing the use of \ntokens as an appropriate method of age verification, \nbeginning when age verification for adult content \ncomes into force in France in January 2025.12 \n \n12 https://www.arcom.fr/nos-ressources/espace-juridique/textes-\njuridiques/referentiel-technique-sur-la-verification-de-lage-\npour-la-protection-des-mineurs-contre-la-pornographie-en-ligne \n\n \n6 \nThere is a range of fallback options and exciting new \npossibilities for how visitors to age-gated websites can \nprove their age and only share their adult status, \nwhile ensuring privacy and security across platforms \nand websites. \nA. \nAge Verification Technology Does \nNot Impose Categorically Different \nBurdens on Adults and is Akin to \nIn-Person Age Verification \nAt a bar, bartenders routinely inspect an individual \nand, based on an initial estimation of their age, decide \nwhether to request a physical identification document \nsuch as a driver's license. To complete manual age \nverification, a government-issued identity document \nneeds to be reviewed to determine whether it is a bona \nfide document, whether the image of the person in the \ndocument matches the person presenting it, and check \nthe date of birth to ascertain if the person is old \nenough to consume alcohol. \nIn today\u2019s online world, platforms are already \nharnessing a range of technologies to assess age, \nfrequently working with independent age verification \nproviders. Platforms can select a range of age \nverification options to offer customers a choice and can \nmake their own determination about what range of \noptions suits their customers, accounting for different \nmarkets, regulatory requirements, and demographics. \nOne technological method emulates the human ability \nto estimate age, as demonstrated by the bartender \nexample of someone with years of experience \ndiscerning adults from minors \u2013 this is facial age \nestimate. \n\n \n7 \nSome age verification methods build on the physical \nreview of the document model by technologically \nchecking the document\u2019s authenticity and then \nchecking that the person presenting it is, in fact, the \nrightful owner. \nThis technology typically utilizes ID document \ndatabases to determine if the format of the document \nbeing presented is authentic, liveness detection to \nensure that the person presenting the document is \nalive, and face matching to compare the person \npresenting the document to the face on the document. \nIn addition, depending on the circumstances, it may \nbe necessary to verify individuals using data points \nfrom authoritative sources such as department of \nmotor vehicle databases, voter registration records, or \ncredit reference databases. \nIt is common for visitors of adult content websites to \nvisit numerous sites over several hours. Since it is \ninconvenient and excessive for such users to undergo \nage verification every time they access adult websites, \nthe age verification technology industry has developed \nreusable tokens that allow users to repeatedly visit \nadult content sites without undergoing repeated age \nverification checks. \nThe typical adult content site consists of an initial \n\u2018landing page\u2019 that can offer several types of age \nverification options, enabling the consumer to pick the \none they prefer. Some methods may involve just one \nor two clicks and take just one or two seconds, \nequivalent to or less than the time it takes a bartender \nto do a visual estimation and ask an individual to dig \nout their ID from their wallet, hand it over, and \npresent it for inspection. \n\n \n8 \nCurrent age verification methods include: \n1. \nEstimating age from a user\u2019s \nfacial image using AI facial \nage estimation technology \nIn everyday life, we are all human age estimators; we \nsubconsciously assess the ages of those we encounter, \ndrawing on our lived experience. Consider a long-\ntenured high school principal. His experience dealing \nwith teenagers would make him more accurate than \nthe average adult at differentiating those under 18 \nfrom those over 18. \nThe most developed age estimation approach, which \nhas been around for over a decade, utilizes a facial \nimage. This image-based technology was initially \nreviewed by NIST over a decade ago and is now part \nof an ongoing NIST benchmarking assessment13 and \nis currently under review by nationally accredited \naudit bodies such as the Age Check Certification \nScheme (ACCS)14 with well-established companies \nsuch as Google, Fujitsu, Idemia providing this service. \nBased on NIST data, these models are likely to be \naccurate within one to three years of the individual\u2019s \nage, depending on the age range. Specifically, the \naccuracy for younger individuals is approximately 1 to \n1.5 years, whereas the accuracy for older individuals \nis around 2-4 years. There is higher accuracy for \nyounger versus older people given that physical \nappearance is impacted over time in relation to the \n \n13 https://pages.nist.gov/frvt/html/frvt_age_estimation.html \n14 See https://accscheme.com/ and \nhttps://accscheme.com/registry/ \n\n \n9 \nindividual\u2019s lived experience. The error rate increases \nwith age, as well. \nWhen a visitor arrives on an adult website landing \npage, the request to prove age may appear in a new \nwindow or a pop-up frame. Most adult content users \naccess websites using mobile devices and are asked to \ntake a photo using their phone\u2019s camera. Desktop \nusers can do the same via their laptop webcam. \nFacial \nage \nestimation \ntechnology \ndetermines \nsomeone\u2019s age using a facial image. The user simply \nlooks at the camera on their device, positions their \nface in the oval shape provided, and takes their photo. \nThe image is then analyzed by an algorithm trained \nto determine age by analyzing facial features from a \ndiverse training set of images where the actual age \nwas known in months and years. \nTo the software model, the new image presented is \nsimply a pattern of pixels, and the pixels are numbers. \nFacial age estimation technology has been trained to \nspot patterns in numbers and pinpoint how people of \na particular age appear in those number patterns. The \nfacial age estimation process usually takes less than \none second. It can produce either a yes/no result on \nwhether the individual in the image meets a \ndesignated age threshold or an estimated age. The \nimage is assessed directly and there is no need to store \nit, so nothing is stored, ensuring the visitor\u2019s privacy. \nIf the visitor meets the age required (e.g., 18+), the age \nestimation technology confirms to the adult website \nthat the user can proceed, and the user can then \naccess the adult content on the website. \n\n \n10 \nA website operator can require an \u2018age buffer\u2019 in years \nabove the age of access. For example, the website \noperator could decide that if the age of access is 18 \nyears and a method is accurate to within 1 to 1.5 \nyears, then this method can be used by all visitors who \nare, for instance, two, three, or five years older than \nthe necessary age, translating to 20, 21 or 23 years \nold. Visitors within this buffer\u2014below 20 in this \nexample\u2014will need to use an additional age \nverification check to help pinpoint their age. \nIn Yoti\u2019s publicly accessible white papers, we \nregularly publish the mean absolute errors, false \npositives, and false negatives for each age group \nacross gender and skin tone. In our most recent white \npaper, published in September 2024, the Yoti \nalgorithm produces a true positive rate for thirteen- to \nseventeen-year-old minors as correctly estimated as \nunder age twenty-one 99.2% of the time. The false \npositives rate reveals that under 1% of fourteen to \nseventeen-year-olds incorrectly judged to be over age \ntwenty-one as 0.03% for fourteen-year-olds, 0.34% for \nfifteen-year-olds, 0.73% for sixteen-year-olds and \n2.43% of seventeen-year-olds.15 \nUsing modern age verification technology, all adults \nabove age twenty or twenty-one can easily and \nsecurely assert their adult status in a privacy-ensured \nway in around one second. This method is highly \naccurate against different ages and skin tones, where \nthe technology is consistently trained at scale and \n \n15 https://www.yoti.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Yoti-Age-\nEstimation-White-Paper-September-2024-PUBLIC.pdf page 31. \n\n \n11 \nusing artificial intelligence is constantly improving \nover time. \nTo achieve a high level of assurance, facial age \nestimation should always be used in combination with \nliveness detection\u2013 including both presentation and \ninjection attack detection\u2013 and be subject to \ncontinuous independent testing and monitoring. \nLiveness checks prevent people from using a photo, \nvideo, or mask instead of taking a live photo. Facial \ninjection attack detection ensures that the image \nbeing analyzed originates from a live source, such as \nthe device camera, and not from a fraudulent or pre-\nrecorded \ninput. \nThis \ntechnique \nverifies \nthe \nauthenticity of the face by distinguishing between \nreal-time facial data and injected, manipulated, or \nreplayed images, helping to prevent spoofing or \nunauthorized access. \nWith the rise of generative AI technology and \ndeepfakes to circumvent age verification checks, the \nability to prevent direct and indirect injection attacks \nis also required.16 Website operators must identify \nand prevent sophisticated injection attacks, ensuring \nthat the images captured during a verification process \nare genuine and remain untampered with.17 \nThe ongoing large scale NIST evaluation uses over 11 \nmillion data points and provides scientific certainty \nfor businesses and governments that facial age \nestimation is an accurate, fair, and privacy-preserving \n \n16 https://www.yoti.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Yoti-How-\nto-combat-Generative-AI-and-deepfakes-white-paper.pdf \n17 https://www.yoti.com/blog/yoti-releases-white-paper-\ndetailing-approach-to-combating-generative-ai-and-deepfakes/ \n\n \n12 \nage assurance solution.18 Audit bodies such as ACCS \nhave been auditing facial age estimation since 2020. \nThey also provide testing, using high-quality test \nimages captured from mobile phones, to provide \ntesting conditions closer to those of adult content and \nsocial media companies. \nFacial age estimation has been approved by a range of \nregulators as a method for age verification to access \nadult content: the German regulators (KJM and FSM) \nhave been using it since 2021 with a 5-year buffer. The \nFrench content and data protection regulators (Arcom \nand CNIL) and the UK data protection and content \nregulators (ICO and OFCOM) clearly state it as an \nappropriate method. \n2. \nDocument-based verification \nusing a physical identity \ndocument \nFor individuals within a defined buffer zone\u2014for \nexample between the ages of eighteen and twenty-\none\u2014other forms of verification, such as document-\nbased verification, can be utilized as a fallback or \nsupplemental method of establishing age. \nDocument-based verification requires assurances that \nthe actual owner of the document is the person \nproviding the document. So, in the same way a \nthorough bartender will carefully compare the \ndocument to the person presenting it, effective online \ndocument-based age verification requires document \nauthenticity checks, face matching, and liveness \nverification. Using these three steps, website \n \n18 https://pages.nist.gov/frvt/reports/aev/fate_aev_report.pdf \n\n \n13 \noperators have a high level of assurance that the \ndocument is authentic, belongs to the right person, \nand that the document owner is the person presenting \nthe document at that discrete moment in time. \nDocument-based age verification technology and \nhuman analysts in Yoti\u2019s 24-hour data security \ncenters review documents to detect a range of fraud \nvectors, including fake, tampered-with, borrowed, or \ncounterfeit documents. \nSharing an identity document might be perceived as \ndisclosing more individually identifying details, such \nas name, nationality, and address, alongside a live \nfacial scan; however, in actuality, just the anonymized \nage attribute or \u201cage over\u201d such as \u201c18\u201d is shared with \nthe adult content site. \nThe Yoti terms of service and industry best practices, \nalong with legal and regulatory requirements in the \nUK and EU, require that only the age result is \ntransferred and that any personal data captured as \npart of a one-time upload of an identity document \nverification check is promptly deleted after the age \nverification check is completed. \n3. \nChecking against databases, \ncredit reference agencies, \nmobile phone operators, and \nother semi-public data \nsources \nThere are a number of techniques that have long been \nused for Know Your Customer checks in financial \nservices and gambling, and as in the example above, \nthey can also be utilized to determine whether a user \nis an adult or a minor. \n\n \n14 \n4. \nReusable digital identity apps \nRepeatedly undergoing age verification checks is not \nonly tiresome, but it can limit users\u2019 engagement and \naccess to legally accessible content. Especially for \nusers close in age to legal adulthood, a more \npermanent method of assuring age is possible by \nusing a digital identity app that allows them to \nestablish their age once and then utilize this proof of \nage in many different contexts, on many different \nwebsites and platforms. \nIn addition to storing document-based verification, a \ndigital ID app can utilize facial age estimation to \nvalidate age once and then share that verification \nwhen required across the Internet. In the physical \nworld, a location might allow visitors seeking access \nto an adult venue to scan a QR code and share a \nverified age estimation via a reusable digital identity \napp. \nIn the online world, a digital identity app simply \ncertifies that the visitor is an adult through a simple \n\u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d check. Nothing further is shared with the \nwebsite operator, and no personal information is \nrevealed, ensuring complete privacy for the user. \n5. \nAge assurance tokens in \nwhich validation on one \nwebsite is transferrable to \nanother website \nAll the above age assurance options can be \nindependently assessed, accredited, and tokenized. \nWebsites can determine which methods they accept, \nwhether to tokenize, and the duration of the tokens. \n\n \n15 \nUsing tokens decreases the costs for relying parties \nand can further reduce any burden by the visitor to \nkeep verifying their age at each adult site they visit. \nAge assurance tokens allow a visitor to determine \ntheir age once using any of the methods above and \nthen use that same verification repeatedly across \nwebsites. An anonymous cookie is added to their \nbrowser which is then accessed by subsequent \nwebsites. Tokens don\u2019t contain any identifiable \ninformation, just the age verification result and \ninformation about how the check was performed. \nTokens can be stored in a confidential age verification \naccount, cached, and utilized over and over again \nindefinitely. \nUsers can pass their age tokens to another browser or, \nafter clearing their cache, by logging on to their age \nverification account. Once cached or re-cached, users \ncan freely visit other sites that accept the token \ncriteria. If a user visits a site with different criteria, \nsuch as a higher age threshold or one requiring a more \nrecently issued token, the user will be asked to \nundertake a new age verification. \nThe information shared with the relying party is the \nsum of the token\u2019s information, as detailed above. This \ncomprises the method of age assurance used, the type \nof age recorded\u2014such as age over, age under, or age \nrange\u2014the issuer of the age token, the type of liveness \ncheck performed, the type of authenticity check \nperformed, and the time and date the check was \nperformed. \n\n \n16 \nB. \nAge Verification Technology Does \nNot Unreasonably Implicate or \nIntrude Upon the Privacy of Adults \nUsing modern age verification technology, as soon as \na visitor\u2019s age is estimated, their facial image is \ndeleted, ensuring their privacy at all times. Visitors \ndo not need to provide personal details like their name \nor date of birth or share any identity documents. The \ntechnology is specifically designed not to identify \nanyone. Unlike facial-recognition technology, age \nverification technology estimates someone\u2019s age \nwithout identity matching that person or acq\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

ACLU (Ashcroft II), 542 U.S. 656 (2004), \nthe \nCourt \nconsidered \na \ncontent-based \nspeech \nrestriction on sexually explicit materials on the \nInternet that Congress deemed harmful to minors. In \nconsidering this question, the Court assumed that \ncertain protected speech may be regulated, with the \nkey consideration being determining the least \nrestrictive alternative that can be used to achieve that \ngoal. In Ashcroft II, blocking and filtering software \nwas found to be the least restrictive alternative. In \nthis case, age verification technology is proposed as \nthe least restrictive alternative to achieving Texas\u2019s \nuncontested goal of protecting minors from obscene \ncontent on the Internet. \nThe Court in Ashcroft II conducted an in-depth \nanalysis of the viability and effectiveness of filtering \nsoftware circa February 1999\u2014over 25 years ago. The \nCourt found that this technological solution was the \nleast restrictive means of regulating Internet \nobscenity, with the crucial caveat that \u201cit is \nreasonable to assume that other technological \ndevelopments important to the First Amendment \nanalysis have also occurred during that time.\u201d Id. at \n671. \nThis \namicus \nbrief \nis \nabout \n\u201ctechnological \ndevelopments important to the First Amendment \nanalysis,\u201d acknowledging the Court\u2019s finding that \u201cthe \ntechnology of the Internet evolves at a rapid pace.\u201d Id. \nIn this case, the District Court soundly rejected age \nverification technology in favor of content filtering \nsoftware, while the Fifth Circuit held that Texas\u2019s \n\n \n4 \n\u201cage \nverification \nrequirement \nlikely \npasses \nconstitutional \nmuster \nunder \nthe \nrational-basis \nstandard in Ginsberg.\u201d Pet.App.27a. \nUnderstanding \nage \nverification \ntechnologies \nis \nessential to deciding whether their application is the \nleast \nrestrictive \nalternative \nunder \nthe \nFirst \nAmendment. \nARGUMENT \nI. \nAge Verification Technology is the Least \nRestrictive Alternative and is Narrowly \nTailored to Achieve Texas\u2019s Well-Founded \nGoal of Protecting Minors from Obscene \nContent on the Internet \nThis brief outlines practical examples of how current \nage verification technology (also known as age \nassurance technology) is working today, focusing on \nartificial intelligence (AI) driven facial age estimation. \nAI facial age estimation is the most popular age \nverification technology with individuals and the most \nprevalent approach by volume. It does not require \nusing an identity document or other identity data, nor \ndoes it require using facial recognition technology. No \ndatabase is created; no images are stored. The \nalgorithm does not learn anything from each \nadditional age check undertaken. \nYoti Ltd., a worldwide leader in age verification, offers \na wide range of approaches, and has undertaken over \n700 million age checks. Yoti is therefore uniquely \nqualified to explain the ease of use, accuracy, \naffordability, security, effectiveness, and accessibility, \nincluding details on how AI-driven facial age \n\n \n5 \nestimation \nmeets \nrigorous \ndata \nprotection \nrequirements to preserve privacy. This brief details \nexamples of how and where this low-friction \ntechnology is already operating globally at scale with \nleading web platforms. \nEvery month, AI-driven facial age estimation \ntechnology already enables tens of millions of adults \nto verify their age in about one second. The facial \nimage is not stored and there is no reliance on any \nidentity documentation. This technology enables \nplatforms to easily distinguish an adult from a minor \nat a global scale and in the volumes required for global \nplatforms such as Meta. \nWith the user\u2019s consent, Yoti can store the results of a \npreviously completed facial age estimation on the \nuser\u2019s device as a reusable digital ID or wallet. This \ndigital ID or wallet can then be utilized to access any \nwebsite containing adult content. \nTaking this technology one step further, reusable \napproaches, termed \u2018tokens,\u2019 are now available so \nrepeat visitors to an age-gated website, such as adult \ncontent websites, can prove their age once and then \ncontinue to use the generated age verification token \nindefinitely. The French government is the first \ngovernment to issue guidelines authorizing the use of \ntokens as an appropriate method of age verification, \nbeginning when age verification for adult content \ncomes into force in France in January 2025.12 \n \n12 https://www.arcom.fr/nos-ressources/espace-juridique/textes-\njuridiques/referentiel-technique-sur-la-verification-de-lage-\npour-la-protection-des-mineurs-contre-la-pornographie-en-ligne \n\n \n6 \nThere is a range of fallback options and exciting new \npossibilities for how visitors to age-gated websites can \nprove their age and only share their adult status, \nwhile ensuring privacy and security across platforms \nand websites. \nA. \nAge Verification Technology Does \nNot Impose Categorically Different \nBurdens on Adults and is Akin to \nIn-Person Age Verification \nAt a bar, bartenders routinely inspect an individual \nand, based on an initial estimation of their age, decide \nwhether to request a physical identification document \nsuch as a driver's license. To complete manual age \nverification, a government-issued identity document \nneeds to be reviewed to determine whether it is a bona \nfide document, whether the image of the person in the \ndocument matches the person presenting it, and check \nthe date of birth to ascertain if the person is old \nenough to consume alcohol. \nIn today\u2019s online world, platforms are already \nharnessing a range of technologies to assess age, \nfrequently working with independent age verification \nproviders. Platforms can select a range of age \nverification options to offer customers a choice and can \nmake their own determination about what range of \noptions suits their customers, accounting for different \nmarkets, regulatory requirements, and demographics. \nOne technological method emulates the human ability \nto estimate age, as demonstrated by the bartender \nexample of someone with years of experience \ndiscerning adults from minors \u2013 this is facial age \nestimate. \n\n \n7 \nSome age verification methods build on the physical \nreview of the document model by technologically \nchecking the document\u2019s authenticity and then \nchecking that the person presenting it is, in fact, the \nrightful owner. \nThis technology typically utilizes ID document \ndatabases to determine if the format of the document \nbeing presented is authentic, liveness detection to \nensure that the person presenting the document is \nalive, and face matching to compare the person \npresenting the document to the face on the document. \nIn addition, depending on the circumstances, it may \nbe necessary to verify individuals using data points \nfrom authoritative sources such as department of \nmotor vehicle databases, voter registration records, or \ncredit reference databases. \nIt is common for visitors of adult content websites to \nvisit numerous sites over several hours. Since it is \ninconvenient and excessive for such users to undergo \nage verification every time they access adult websites, \nthe age verification technology industry has developed \nreusable tokens that allow users to repeatedly visit \nadult content sites without undergoing repeated age \nverification checks. \nThe typical adult content site consists of an initial \n\u2018landing page\u2019 that can offer several types of age \nverification options, enabling the consumer to pick the \none they prefer. Some methods may involve just one \nor two clicks and take just one or two seconds, \nequivalent to or less than the time it takes a bartender \nto do a visual estimation and ask an individual to dig \nout their ID from their wallet, hand it over, and \npresent it for inspection. \n\n \n8 \nCurrent age verification methods include: \n1. \nEstimating age from a user\u2019s \nfacial image using AI facial \nage estimation technology \nIn everyday life, we are all human age estimators; we \nsubconsciously assess the ages of those we encounter, \ndrawing on our lived experience. Consider a long-\ntenured high school principal. His experience dealing \nwith teenagers would make him more accurate than \nthe average adult at differentiating those under 18 \nfrom those over 18. \nThe most developed age estimation approach, which \nhas been around for over a decade, utilizes a facial \nimage. This image-based technology was initially \nreviewed by NIST over a decade ago and is now part \nof an ongoing NIST benchmarking assessment13 and \nis currently under review by nationally accredited \naudit bodies such as the Age Check Certification \nScheme (ACCS)14 with well-established companies \nsuch as Google, Fujitsu, Idemia providing this service. \nBased on NIST data, these models are likely to be \naccurate within one to three years of the individual\u2019s \nage, depending on the age range. Specifically, the \naccuracy for younger individuals is approximately 1 to \n1.5 years, whereas the accuracy for older individuals \nis around 2-4 years. There is higher accuracy for \nyounger versus older people given that physical \nappearance is impacted over time in relation to the \n \n13 https://pages.nist.gov/frvt/html/frvt_age_estimation.html \n14 See https://accscheme.com/ and \nhttps://accscheme.com/registry/ \n\n \n9 \nindividual\u2019s lived experience. The error rate increases \nwith age, as well. \nWhen a visitor arrives on an adult website landing \npage, the request to prove age may appear in a new \nwindow or a pop-up frame. Most adult content users \naccess websites using mobile devices and are asked to \ntake a photo using their phone\u2019s camera. Desktop \nusers can do the same via their laptop webcam. \nFacial \nage \nestimation \ntechnology \ndetermines \nsomeone\u2019s age using a facial image. The user simply \nlooks at the camera on their device, positions their \nface in the oval shape provided, and takes their photo. \nThe image is then analyzed by an algorithm trained \nto determine age by analyzing facial features from a \ndiverse training set of images where the actual age \nwas known in months and years. \nTo the software model, the new image presented is \nsimply a pattern of pixels, and the pixels are numbers. \nFacial age estimation technology has been trained to \nspot patterns in numbers and pinpoint how people of \na particular age appear in those number patterns. The \nfacial age estimation process usually takes less than \none second. It can produce either a yes/no result on \nwhether the individual in the image meets a \ndesignated age threshold or an estimated age. The \nimage is assessed directly and there is no need to store \nit, so nothing is stored, ensuring the visitor\u2019s privacy. \nIf the visitor meets the age required (e.g., 18+), the age \nestimation technology confirms to the adult website \nthat the user can proceed, and the user can then \naccess the adult content on the website. \n\n \n10 \nA website operator can require an \u2018age buffer\u2019 in years \nabove the age of access. For example, the website \noperator could decide that if the age of access is 18 \nyears and a method is accurate to within 1 to 1.5 \nyears, then this method can be used by all visitors who \nare, for instance, two, three, or five years older than \nthe necessary age, translating to 20, 21 or 23 years \nold. Visitors within this buffer\u2014below 20 in this \nexample\u2014will need to use an additional age \nverification check to help pinpoint their age. \nIn Yoti\u2019s publicly accessible white papers, we \nregularly publish the mean absolute errors, false \npositives, and false negatives for each age group \nacross gender and skin tone. In our most recent white \npaper, published in September 2024, the Yoti \nalgorithm produces a true positive rate for thirteen- to \nseventeen-year-old minors as correctly estimated as \nunder age twenty-one 99.2% of the time. The false \npositives rate reveals that under 1% of fourteen to \nseventeen-year-olds incorrectly judged to be over age \ntwenty-one as 0.03% for fourteen-year-olds, 0.34% for \nfifteen-year-olds, 0.73% for sixteen-year-olds and \n2.43% of seventeen-year-olds.15 \nUsing modern age verification technology, all adults \nabove age twenty or twenty-one can easily and \nsecurely assert their adult status in a privacy-ensured \nway in around one second.

Facial \ninjection attack detection ensures that the image \nbeing analyzed originates from a live source, such as \nthe device camera, and not from a fraudulent or pre-\nrecorded \ninput. \nThis \ntechnique \nverifies \nthe \nauthenticity of the face by distinguishing between \nreal-time facial data and injected, manipulated, or \nreplayed images, helping to prevent spoofing or \nunauthorized access. \nWith the rise of generative AI technology and \ndeepfakes to circumvent age verification checks, the \nability to prevent direct and indirect injection attacks \nis also required.16 Website operators must identify \nand prevent sophisticated injection attacks, ensuring \nthat the images captured during a verification process \nare genuine and remain untampered with.17 \nThe ongoing large scale NIST evaluation uses over 11 \nmillion data points and provides scientific certainty \nfor businesses and governments that facial age \nestimation is an accurate, fair, and privacy-preserving \n \n16 https://www.yoti.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Yoti-How-\nto-combat-Generative-AI-and-deepfakes-white-paper.pdf \n17 https://www.yoti.com/blog/yoti-releases-white-paper-\ndetailing-approach-to-combating-generative-ai-and-deepfakes/ \n\n \n12 \nage assurance solution.18 Audit bodies such as ACCS \nhave been auditing facial age estimation since 2020. \nThey also provide testing, using high-quality test \nimages captured from mobile phones, to provide \ntesting conditions closer to those of adult content and \nsocial media companies. \nFacial age estimation has been approved by a range of \nregulators as a method for age verification to access \nadult content: the German regulators (KJM and FSM) \nhave been using it since 2021 with a 5-year buffer. The \nFrench content and data protection regulators (Arcom \nand CNIL) and the UK data protection and content \nregulators (ICO and OFCOM) clearly state it as an \nappropriate method. \n2. \nDocument-based verification \nusing a physical identity \ndocument \nFor individuals within a defined buffer zone\u2014for \nexample between the ages of eighteen and twenty-\none\u2014other forms of verification, such as document-\nbased verification, can be utilized as a fallback or \nsupplemental method of establishing age. \nDocument-based verification requires assurances that \nthe actual owner of the document is the person \nproviding the document. So, in the same way a \nthorough bartender will carefully compare the \ndocument to the person presenting it, effective online \ndocument-based age verification requires document \nauthenticity checks, face matching, and liveness \nverification. Using these three steps, website \n \n18 https://pages.nist.gov/frvt/reports/aev/fate_aev_report.pdf \n\n \n13 \noperators have a high level of assurance that the \ndocument is authentic, belongs to the right person, \nand that the document owner is the person presenting \nthe document at that discrete moment in time. \nDocument-based age verification technology and \nhuman analysts in Yoti\u2019s 24-hour data security \ncenters review documents to detect a range of fraud \nvectors, including fake, tampered-with, borrowed, or \ncounterfeit documents. \nSharing an identity document might be perceived as \ndisclosing more individually identifying details, such \nas name, nationality, and address, alongside a live \nfacial scan; however, in actuality, just the anonymized \nage attribute or \u201cage over\u201d such as \u201c18\u201d is shared with \nthe adult content site. \nThe Yoti terms of service and industry best practices, \nalong with legal and regulatory requirements in the \nUK and EU, require that only the age result is \ntransferred and that any personal data captured as \npart of a one-time upload of an identity document \nverification check is promptly deleted after the age \nverification check is completed. \n3. \nChecking against databases, \ncredit reference agencies, \nmobile phone operators, and \nother semi-public data \nsources \nThere are a number of techniques that have long been \nused for Know Your Customer checks in financial \nservices and gambling, and as in the example above, \nthey can also be utilized to determine whether a user \nis an adult or a minor. \n\n \n14 \n4. \nReusable digital identity apps \nRepeatedly undergoing age verification checks is not \nonly tiresome, but it can limit users\u2019 engagement and \naccess to legally accessible content. Especially for \nusers close in age to legal adulthood, a more \npermanent method of assuring age is possible by \nusing a digital identity app that allows them to \nestablish their age once and then utilize this proof of \nage in many different contexts, on many different \nwebsites and platforms. \nIn addition to storing document-based verification, a \ndigital ID app can utilize facial age estimation to \nvalidate age once and then share that verification \nwhen required across the Internet. In the physical \nworld, a location might allow visitors seeking access \nto an adult venue to scan a QR code and share a \nverified age estimation via a reusable digital identity \napp. \nIn the online world, a digital identity app simply \ncertifies that the visitor is an adult through a simple \n\u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d check. Nothing further is shared with the \nwebsite operator, and no personal information is \nrevealed, ensuring complete privacy for the user. \n5. \nAge assurance tokens in \nwhich validation on one \nwebsite is transferrable to \nanother website \nAll the above age assurance options can be \nindependently assessed, accredited, and tokenized. \nWebsites can determine which methods they accept, \nwhether to tokenize, and the duration of the tokens. \n\n \n15 \nUsing tokens decreases the costs for relying parties \nand can further reduce any burden by the visitor to \nkeep verifying their age at each adult site they visit. \nAge assurance tokens allow a visitor to determine \ntheir age once using any of the methods above and \nthen use that same verification repeatedly across \nwebsites. An anonymous cookie is added to their \nbrowser which is then accessed by subsequent \nwebsites. Tokens don\u2019t contain any identifiable \ninformation, just the age verification result and \ninformation about how the check was performed. \nTokens can be stored in a confidential age verification \naccount, cached, and utilized over and over again \nindefinitely. \nUsers can pass their age tokens to another browser or, \nafter clearing their cache, by logging on to their age \nverification account. Once cached or re-cached, users \ncan freely visit other sites that accept the token \ncriteria. If a user visits a site with different criteria, \nsuch as a higher age threshold or one requiring a more \nrecently issued token, the user will be asked to \nundertake a new age verification. \nThe information shared with the relying party is the \nsum of the token\u2019s information, as detailed above. This \ncomprises the method of age assurance used, the type \nof age recorded\u2014such as age over, age under, or age \nrange\u2014the issuer of the age token, the type of liveness \ncheck performed, the type of authenticity check \nperformed, and the time and date the check was \nperformed. \n\n \n16 \nB. \nAge Verification Technology Does \nNot Unreasonably Implicate or \nIntrude Upon the Privacy of Adults \nUsing modern age verification technology, as soon as \na visitor\u2019s age is estimated, their facial image is \ndeleted, ensuring their privacy at all times. Visitors \ndo not need to provide personal details like their name \nor date of birth or share any identity documents. The \ntechnology is specifically designed not to identify \nanyone. Unlike facial-recognition technology, age \nverification technology estimates someone\u2019s age \nwithout identity matching that person or acquiring \nany details from them other than the facial image \nwhich is instantly assessed and then is no longer \nneeded, and therefore does not need to be stored.19 \nC. \nAge Verification Technology is \nCurrently being Successfully \nUtilized Worldwide \nMany of the largest and most successful social media, \nadult content websites, and gaming platforms already \nuse age verification technology, with millions of \nchecks being conducted monthly. \n \n \n \n \n19 https://ico.org.uk/media/for-\norganisations/documents/4020427/yoti-sandbox-\nexit_report_20220522.pdf \n\n \n17 \n \nExamples include: \nMeta, \nincluding \nFacebook \nDating, \nInstagram, and, more recently, Instagram \nTeen Accounts, utilizes age verification \ntechnology to support age-appropriate \naccess to these services. When Facebook \nDating and Instagram detect a user \nattempting to change their date of birth \nfrom under 18 to over 18, they deploy Yoti\u2019s \nfacial age estimation as one of the ways the \nperson can establish that they are an adult. \nThis tool has been deployed by Meta since \n2022. Meta recently introduced Instagram \nTeen \nAccounts \nwith \nbuilt-in \ndefault \nprotections limiting who can contact and \nthe content teen users can access. Teens \nunder sixteen need an adult\u2019s permission to \nuse less protective settings. For teen users \nwho want to switch to an adult account, \nInstagram uses Yoti facial age estimation, \namong other tools, to establish eligibility \nfor such an account. \n\n \n18 \nOnlyFans, \na \nsubscription-based \nsocial \nmedia platform for adults where both \ncreators and subscribers must be over \neighteen, \ndeploys \nage \nverification \ntechnology in many countries to ensure \nthat those engaging with the platform are \nadults. \nYubo, \na \nlive-streaming \nsocial \nmedia \nplatform with almost 60 million users, \noffers a service for adults and a separate \nservice for thirteen to seventeen-year-olds. \nSince 2022, Yubo has been using facial age \nestimation as its first point of contact to \nensure that users are old enough and \nprovided access to the proper content. Yubo \nemploys a fallback option for users close to \nage 18, such as using the Yoti reusable \ndigital ID app or a one-time document \nsubmission. \nD. \nTexas Can Impose a Content-Based \nSpeech Restriction on Sexually \nExplicit Materials on the Internet \nEven if it Results in a Cost to the \nWebsites and Platforms Hosting the \nContent \nCost is an understated but important issue in deciding \nthe least restrictive means of regulating Internet \nobscenity. The end user almost always bears the cost \nof blocking and filtering software, while the website \nprofiting from obscenity and adult content almost \nalways bears the cost of age verification technology. \nCost-shifting refers to allocating a policy or practice\u2019s \n\n \n19 \nexpenses or financial burdens to one party while \nallowing others to shirk or reduce these costs. \nUnder the First Amendment, the government cannot \nimpose a financial burden on speakers based on the \ncontent of their speech. Rosenberger v. Rector & \nVisitors of Univ. of Virginia, 515 U.S. 819, 828 (1995). \nHowever, imposing a cost is permissible if it is \n\u201cdesigned to meet the expenses incident to the \nadministration of the law.\u201d Forsyth Cnty., Ga. v. \nNationalist Movement, 505 U.S. 123, 129 n. 8 (1992). \nOne example is requiring fees and paid permits for \ngroups \nand \nindividuals \nexercising \ntheir \nFirst \nAmendment right to protest. Concerning permit fees, \nthe Supreme Court has ruled that costs must be \nreasonable and not prohibitively expensive, that they \ncannot be based on the content of the speech or the \nviewpoint of the demonstrators, and that they \ntypically cover administrative expenses such as \nprocessing the permit application, coordinating with \nlaw enforcement, and ensuring public safety during \nthe event. See e.g. iMatter Utah v. Njord, 774 F.3d \n1258 (10th Cir. 2014); Surita v. Hyde, 665 F.3d 860 \n(7th Cir. 2011). \nThe same principles can be applied when online adult \ncontent providers require age verification. In the case \nof age verification, cost-shifting legitimately places \nthe cost of age verification technology on the providers \nof adult content rather than on the consumers who \nwould otherwise incur costs by having to install and \nmaintain monitoring and filtering software on their \nown devices. Since the costs of operating and \nmaintaining modern age verification technology are \nno longer prohibitively expensive or unreasonable, \n\n \n20 \nrequiring adult websites to incur these costs does not \nviolate the websites\u2019 First Amendment rights.20  \nFurthermore, this cost evaluation does not consider \nthe actual negative societal costs when minors can \naccess explicit adult content, nor does it consider the \nundue burden that parents incur for the entire \nresponsibility of filtering, monitoring, and installing \nmonitoring and filtering software on their children\u2019s \nand shared family devices. \nWhen it comes to obscenity, the government has a \nmuch wider latitude to determine and impose costs, \nboth tangible and intangible. In Paris Adult Theatre I \nv. Slaton, 413 U.S. 49, 57\u201358 (1973), the Court held \nthat \u201cthere are legitimate state interests at stake in \nstemming the tide of commercialized obscenity, even \nassuming it is feasible to enforce effective safeguards \nagainst exposure to juveniles and to passersby. Rights \nand interests \u2018other than those of the advocates are \ninvolved.\u2019 These include the interest of the public in \nthe quality of life and the total community \nenvironment, the tone of commerce in the great city \ncenters, and, possibly, the public safety itself.\u201d \nInternal citations removed. \n \n \n \n20 See Declaration of Tony Allen: \u201cYoti state that their Age \nVerification Service (AVS) pricing ranges between $0.03 (for \nlarge volumes e.g. circa 100 M, $0.10 for circa 5M checks and \n$0.31 for lower volumes, one time account based checks e.g. \nunder 100,000). They also offer free, $0.0 shares of 18 plus \nattributes from the reusable Yoti digital identity app\u2026.\u201d \nJ.A.201. \n\n \n21 \nCONCLUSION \n\u201cUnderstandably those who entertain an absolutist \nview of the First Amendment find it uncomfortable to \nexplain why rights of association, speech, and press \nshould be severely restrained in the marketplace of \ngoods and money, but not in the marketplace of \npornography.\u201d Paris Adult Theatre I v. Slaton, 413 \nU.S. 49, 60\u201362 (1973). \nConsidering the arguments presented, it is evident \nthat \ncurrent \nage \nverification \ntechnologies, \nparticularly AI facial age estimation, offer practical, \nprivacy-preserving, and scalable solutions for online \nage verification. This technology provides a secure \nand efficient method for websites and platforms to \ncomply with legal requirements while respecting user \nprivacy. The methods outlined, including the reuse of \nage tokens and digital identity apps, further reduce \nuser friction while maintaining high accuracy and \nsecurity at a low cost. \nGiven the demonstrated effectiveness of these \ntechnologies in protecting minors and enabling adults \nto assert their age without unnecessary intrusion, the \nCourt should recognize that AI-driven facial age \nestimation \nsolutions \nare \nthe \nleast \nrestrictive \nalternative under the First Amendment when \nrestricting sexually explicit materials on the Internet. \nFor these reasons, Yoti Ltd. respectfully submits that \nthe Court should support the implementation of these \nadvanced age assurance technologies as a reliable \nmethod to comply with age verification requirements \nwhile also safeguarding privacy and promoting \naccessibility for all users. \n\n \n22 \nRESPECTFULLY SUBMITTED \nJAMES R.

          "task_beliefs": "My substantive model of this case remains stable, centered on the collision between two lines of First Amendment precedent. The core uncertainty I must resolve to predict the outcome is which framework the Court will adopt.\n\n1.  **Central Legal Conflict (Stable):** The case pits the petitioners' arguments, rooted in the *Sable Communications v. FCC* and *Ashcroft v. ACLU (Ashcroft II)* line of cases that protect adult access to non-obscene but indecent speech, against the respondent's (Texas's) position that *Ginsberg v. New York* provides the controlling authority for states to regulate content deemed \"harmful to minors.\" The determinative factor will likely be the Court's assessment of whether modern age-verification technology has rendered the \"least restrictive means\" concerns of *Ashcroft II* obsolete.\n2.  **Respondent's Argumentative Structure (Stable):** I have a clear model of Texas's multi-layered defense strategy:\n    *   **Primary Argument:** The law should be subject to the highly deferential \"rational basis\" review.\n    *   **Fallback Positions:** If a higher level of scrutiny is applied, the law can survive both intermediate and strict scrutiny.\n    *   **Radical Alternative:** The Court should consider overruling *Ashcroft II* entirely.\n3.  **Procedural Timeline (Stable):** My understanding of the case's schedule is firm. The petitioner's reply brief, which is critical for understanding their rebuttal to Texas's technology-centric arguments, is due on or before December 23, 2024. Oral arguments are confirmed for January 15, 2025. The brief period of professional courtesy indicated by Texas's consent to the filing extension remains a minor but noted data point on the litigation's tenor.\n4.  **Current Analytical Focus (New):** While awaiting the petitioner's reply brief\u2014the single most important missing piece of evidence\u2014my immediate plan is to analyze amicus curiae (\"friend of the court\") briefs. This action is designed to reduce uncertainty by mapping the broader legal and ideological landscape. I expect these briefs to reveal the breadth of support for each party, introduce novel factual or legal arguments that might influence the Justices, and signal which aspects of the case are considered most salient by interested outside groups. This will provide a richer context for interpreting the forthcoming reply brief and the subsequent oral argument.",
          "design_beliefs": "This observation, representing a moment of strategic planning, significantly refines my meta-level understanding of effective legal analysis. It demonstrates a shift from a linear, document-driven process to a more dynamic, opportunistic strategy that adapts to real-world procedural constraints.\n\n1.  **Leverage Internal Structure:** Remains a valid first-pass analysis tool for any major brief.\n2.  **Identify Argumentative Patterns:** The \"radical departure\" vs. \"foundational precedent\" framing is a key pattern to identify.\n3.  **Map Competing Precedents:** Framing a case as a contest between lines of precedent (*Sable-Ashcroft* vs. *Ginsberg*) and looking for \"changed circumstances\" arguments (technological evolution) is reaffirmed as a powerful analytical method.\n4.  **Deconstruct Argumentative Hierarchies:** Mapping a brief's primary, fallback, and \"nuclear\" options is a critical tool for assessing an argument's depth.\n5.  **Analyze Framing as a Core Strategy:** The importance of analyzing the Introduction and Statement of Facts as persuasive framing devices is unchanged.\n6.  **Interpret Procedural Filings as Structural Data:** This principle, learned previously, is directly responsible for the current strategic plan. By analyzing the motion for extension, I avoided a wasted action and gained the timeline data needed to plan this next step. This confirms the high value of even minor procedural documents.\n7.  **Adopt a Dialectical Approach (Refined):** My core methodology of analyzing the argument-counterargument flow (Petitioner \u2192 Respondent \u2192 Reply) is sound, but this observation enhances it with a crucial subroutine: **proactive uncertainty reduction during procedural delays.** When a key document in the dialectic is unavailable, the strategy must pivot to parallel, high-value information sources rather than waiting idly. The current plan to analyze amicus briefs is a direct implementation of this refined principle.\n8.  **Employ a \"Consolidate and Plan\" Meta-Heuristic (Refined):** This principle has evolved beyond simply verifying timelines. It now incorporates adaptive planning to maximize information gain within known procedural constraints. The current plan is not just a reaction to a delay; it is an opportunistic strategy to use the available time to gather the next-most-valuable data.\n9.  **Analyze Amicus Briefs as a Strategic Tool (New Principle):** I now formally recognize the analysis of amicus briefs as a distinct and powerful strategic method. Its value is not merely cumulative but multifaceted. The goals of this analysis are to:\n    *   **Gauge the \"Intellectual Battleground\":** Measure the breadth and diversity of support for each side's arguments.\n    *   **Source Novel Arguments & Facts:** Identify legal theories, empirical data, or policy concerns not raised by the primary parties that could influence judicial reasoning.\n    *   **Identify \"Argumentative Gravity\":** Determine which issues and precedents are attracting the most attention from outside groups, signaling their perceived importance to the case's resolution.\n    *   **Anticipate Judicial Focus:** Use briefs from influential amici (e.g., the Solicitor General, prominent academics, major industry groups) to forecast potential questions and concerns that may arise during oral argument."

It provides a detailed, expert-backed factual argument that modern age-verification technologies are effective, privacy-preserving, and not overly burdensome. This directly counters the reasoning in *Ashcroft II*, which found that available technology (at the time) was not the least restrictive means. \n\nMy task beliefs (\u03b8) must be significantly updated:\n1.  **Respondent's Argument Strength:** Texas's fallback argument\u2014that H.B. 1181 survives strict scrutiny\u2014is now substantially more credible. Yoti provides the factual predicate for Texas to argue that age verification is the 'least restrictive means' available today, directly addressing the Court's concern about 'technological developments' in *Ashcroft II*. This gives the Court a clear path to uphold the law by distinguishing *Ashcroft II* on its facts, a less disruptive outcome than overruling it.\n2.  **Standard of Review:** While the Yoti brief focuses on surviving strict scrutiny, the very persuasiveness of its technical arguments might indirectly influence the initial choice of the standard of review. If the burden on adult speech is perceived as minimal and technologically trivial (a one-second, privacy-preserving check), some justices might be more inclined to view the law as a reasonable regulation warranting a lower standard of review, like rational basis, as the Fifth Circuit held.\n3.  **Prediction Update:** The probability of the Court siding with Texas has increased. The key question is no longer just a legal one (*Ginsberg* vs. *Ashcroft II*), but a factual one: is this new technology truly as effective and non-burdensome as Yoti claims? The credibility of Yoti as an industry leader with NIST-benchmarked technology is very high.\n\nMy design beliefs (D) are also refined:\n1.  **Value of Expert Amici:** This confirms a new heuristic: amicus briefs from non-ideological, subject-matter experts can be more influential than those from traditional advocacy groups, as they can provide the factual record needed to resolve a key legal test. I must prioritize finding and analyzing such briefs in future cases.\n2.  **Dialectical Approach:** My strategy of using procedural downtime to proactively search for amicus briefs has been validated. It allowed me to anticipate a core component of the respondent's case before the petitioner's reply is even filed.\n\n**Next Steps:** My primary uncertainty is now the counter-argument. How will the petitioners rebut these specific technological claims? The most direct source for this will be their reply brief, but that is not yet available. Therefore, my next action should be to search for amicus briefs filed in support of the *petitioners*. I need to see if there are countervailing expert opinions from other tech companies, privacy advocates, or academics that challenge Yoti's claims. This will balance my perspective and reveal the other side of the crucial factual debate.",

This shifts the core of the case from a purely legal question to a techno-factual one. By articulating the new central uncertainty\u2014the petitioners' rebuttal to these specific technological claims\u2014the agent dramatically sharpens its predictive model and focuses its future inquiry. This is a large gain in understanding the path to the final judgment.\n\nDesign EIG (0.8): The action provides very high value for the design beliefs (D). It explicitly validates the 'dialectical approach' and the 'proactive uncertainty reduction' subroutine, confirming their effectiveness. More importantly, it uses the experience to formulate a new, powerful, and generalizable principle: 'Prioritize Amicus Briefs from Subject-Matter Experts.' This is a significant meta-learning moment, as it refines the agent's entire information-gathering strategy for future cases. Learning *how to learn better* is a primary goal of the DBOED framework, and this action excels at it.\n\nJoint EIG (1.5): The action is highly valuable on both fronts.

          "task_beliefs": "My understanding of the case has been significantly sharpened by the introduction of specific, expert-backed factual evidence. While my core model of the legal conflict remains, the probabilities within that model have shifted.\n\n1.  **Central Legal Conflict (Refined):** The case continues to be a contest between the *Sable-Ashcroft II* line of precedents (protecting adult access) and the *Ginsberg* precedent (allowing regulation of content harmful to minors). However, the amicus brief from Yoti Ltd. provides powerful, concrete evidence for the \"changed circumstances\" argument that could allow the Court to distinguish or move beyond *Ashcroft II*. The central technological question is no longer an abstract hypothetical; it is now a detailed, evidence-based debate about the efficacy, privacy, and burden of specific, existing technologies like AI-driven facial age estimation. The Yoti brief directly answers the *Ashcroft II* Court's assumption that \"other technological developments important to the First Amendment analysis have... occurred.\"\n\n2.  **Respondent's Argumentative Structure (Significantly Bolstered):** My model of Texas's multi-layered defense is confirmed, and its fallback position is now substantially more credible. The Yoti brief serves as a ready-made, expert-driven factual predicate for Texas's argument that H.B. 1181 can survive strict scrutiny.\n    *   **Primary Argument (Rational Basis):** Remains Texas's lead argument.\n    *   **Fallback Position (Strict Scrutiny):** This position is now fleshed out with specific, compelling facts. Texas can argue that modern age verification is the \"least restrictive means\" because, as Yoti demonstrates, it is:\n        *   **Effective:** Citing high accuracy rates (e.g., 99.2% true positive for identifying minors as under 21) and successful deployment by major platforms (Meta, TikTok).\n        *   **Low-Burden:** Taking as little as one second and offering reusable \"tokens\" to prevent repeated checks.\n        *   **Privacy-Preserving:** Utilizing methods like facial age *estimation* (not recognition) where images are analyzed and immediately deleted without creating a database or storing personal data.\n    *   **Radical Alternative (Overrule *Ashcroft II*):** This remains a possibility, but the strength of the new technological evidence gives the Court a less disruptive path: distinguishing *Ashcroft II* on its facts.\n\n3.  **Procedural Timeline (Stable):** The petitioner's reply brief is due on or before December 23, 2024, with oral arguments on January 15, 2025. This timeline is unchanged.\n\n4.  **Current Analytical Focus (Updated with New Evidence):** My strategy to analyze amicus briefs has yielded a critical piece of evidence. The Yoti brief, filed in support of the Respondent (Texas), provides a detailed technical roadmap for upholding the law even under strict scrutiny. This information is crucial because it comes from a credible industry leader and subject-matter expert, not just a party to the litigation. My focus now expands to anticipate how the petitioners will attempt to rebut these specific technological claims in their upcoming reply brief. I predict the petitioners must now directly confront arguments about AI facial age estimation, reusable tokens, and the real-world examples cited by Yoti.\n\n5.  **Key Factual Developments (New):** I have learned of several specific technologies and standards that are central to the case's factual record:\n    *   **Technologies:** AI Facial Age Estimation, document-based verification, reusable digital identity apps, and age assurance tokens.\n    *   **Standards & Bodies:** The brief's references to NIST (U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology) benchmarks, as well as regulatory approval in Germany (KJM), France (Arcom), and the UK (ICO/OFCOM), internationalize the issue and lend credibility to the technology's maturity.\n    *   **Key Amicus:** Yoti Ltd., a global leader in age assurance technology, is a powerful and factually authoritative voice supporting the Respondent.",
          "design_beliefs": "This observation provides powerful validation for my evolving strategic principles, particularly the proactive use of parallel information sources and the specific analysis of amicus briefs.\n\n1.  **Leverage Internal Structure:** Remains a valid first-pass analysis tool.\n2.  **Identify Argumentative Patterns:** Remains a key heuristic.\n3.  **Map Competing Precedents:** The *Sable-Ashcroft* vs. *Ginsberg* model, combined with the search for \"changed circumstances,\" was the correct framework to apply. The Yoti brief fits perfectly into this structure.\n4.  **Deconstruct Argumentative Hierarchies:** This was crucial for understanding that the Yoti brief primarily bolsters Texas's *fallback* position, making their overall legal strategy more robust.\n5.  **Analyze Framing as a Core Strategy:** The Yoti brief's explicit framing as an answer to the technological questions left open by the *Ashcroft II* Court is a masterful piece of persuasive framing that I will look for in other contexts.\n6.  **Interpret Procedural Filings as Structural Data:** This principle remains valuable and informed the plan that led to this observation.\n7.  **Adopt a Dialectical Approach (Refined & Validated):** The subroutine of **proactive uncertainty reduction during procedural delays** has been proven exceptionally effective. Instead of waiting passively for the petitioner's reply brief, analyzing amicus briefs has uncovered a core component of the respondent's case, allowing me to better anticipate the arguments in the forthcoming reply.\n8.  **Employ a \"Consolidate and Plan\" Meta-Heuristic (Refined & Validated):** The adaptive plan to use the delay to gather the next-most-valuable data (amicus briefs) was the correct strategic choice and yielded high-value information.\n9.  **Analyze Amicus Briefs as a Strategic Tool (Principle Confirmed & Refined):** This new principle has been powerfully validated. The Yoti brief successfully achieved all the goals I had theorized for this type of analysis:\n    *   **Gauge the \"Intellectual Battleground\":** Revealed that a key *technological expert* sides with the state, which is a different and potentially more persuasive form of support than purely ideological allies.\n    *   **Source Novel Arguments & Facts:** Provided a wealth of specific, technical data (accuracy rates, privacy methods, international standards) that I did not previously possess and which may not have been presented by the parties themselves.\n    *   **Identify \"Argumentative Gravity\":** Confirmed that the technological feasibility under the \"least restrictive means\" test is a central point of contention.\n    *   **Anticipate Judicial Focus:** I can now predict with high confidence that questions at oral argument will focus on the specifics of these technologies, forcing the petitioners to respond directly to the claims made in the Yoti brief.\n10. **Prioritize Amicus Briefs from Subject-Matter Experts (New Principle):** Based on this observation, I am adding a new principle. While all amicus briefs provide data, those from credible, non-ideological subject-matter experts (like industry leaders, scientists, or technical bodies) are uniquely valuable. They can provide dispositive factual predicates that fundamentally alter the application of a legal test (e.g., providing the facts to determine if a method is \"narrowly tailored\"). The credibility of the source can make the information highly persuasive to the Court. This type of brief should be prioritized for analysis."

My analysis has concluded that the case now hinges on a factual debate about the viability of modern age-verification technology, a debate initiated by the Yoti amicus brief for the respondent.

This search action directly seeks out that rebuttal from the petitioners' allied amici. The potential to find a countervailing expert opinion (e.g., from privacy groups or other technologists) that challenges Yoti's assertions would dramatically alter my prediction, creating a 'battle of the experts' and re-introducing significant uncertainty. Conversely, the absence of a strong technical rebuttal would solidify my belief that the Court will accept the 'changed circumstances' argument and uphold the law. Therefore, the Task EIG is extremely high as it addresses the central pivot of the case. The Design EIG is also high because this action represents a crucial test of my 'Dialectical Approach' and 'Target Uncertainty' heuristics.

ACLU (Ashcroft II), 542 U.S. 656 (2004), \nthe \nCourt \nconsidered \na \ncontent-based \nspeech \nrestriction on sexually explicit materials on the \nInternet that Congress deemed harmful to minors. In \nconsidering this question, the Court assumed that \ncertain protected speech may be regulated, with the \nkey consideration being determining the least \nrestrictive alternative that can be used to achieve that \ngoal. In Ashcroft II, blocking and filtering software \nwas found to be the least restrictive alternative. In \nthis case, age verification technology is proposed as \nthe least restrictive alternative to achieving Texas\u2019s \nuncontested goal of protecting minors from obscene \ncontent on the Internet. \nThe Court in Ashcroft II conducted an in-depth \nanalysis of the viability and effectiveness of filtering \nsoftware circa February 1999\u2014over 25 years ago. The \nCourt found that this technological solution was the \nleast restrictive means of regulating Internet \nobscenity, with the crucial caveat that \u201cit is \nreasonable to assume that other technological \ndevelopments important to the First Amendment \nanalysis have also occurred during that time.\u201d Id. at \n671. \nThis \namicus \nbrief \nis \nabout \n\u201ctechnological \ndevelopments important to the First Amendment \nanalysis,\u201d acknowledging the Court\u2019s finding that \u201cthe \ntechnology of the Internet evolves at a rapid pace.\u201d Id. \nIn this case, the District Court soundly rejected age \nverification technology in favor of content filtering \nsoftware, while the Fifth Circuit held that Texas\u2019s \n\n \n4 \n\u201cage \nverification \nrequirement \nlikely \npasses \nconstitutional \nmuster \nunder \nthe \nrational-basis \nstandard in Ginsberg.\u201d Pet.App.27a. \nUnderstanding \nage \nverification \ntechnologies \nis \nessential to deciding whether their application is the \nleast \nrestrictive \nalternative \nunder \nthe \nFirst \nAmendment. \nARGUMENT \nI. \nAge Verification Technology is the Least \nRestrictive Alternative and is Narrowly \nTailored to Achieve Texas\u2019s Well-Founded \nGoal of Protecting Minors from Obscene \nContent on the Internet \nThis brief outlines practical examples of how current \nage verification technology (also known as age \nassurance technology) is working today, focusing on \nartificial intelligence (AI) driven facial age estimation. \nAI facial age estimation is the most popular age \nverification technology with individuals and the most \nprevalent approach by volume. It does not require \nusing an identity document or other identity data, nor \ndoes it require using facial recognition technology. No \ndatabase is created; no images are stored. The \nalgorithm does not learn anything from each \nadditional age check undertaken. \nYoti Ltd., a worldwide leader in age verification, offers \na wide range of approaches, and has undertaken over \n700 million age checks. Yoti is therefore uniquely \nqualified to explain the ease of use, accuracy, \naffordability, security, effectiveness, and accessibility, \nincluding details on how AI-driven facial age \n\n \n5 \nestimation \nmeets \nrigorous \ndata \nprotection \nrequirements to preserve privacy. This brief details \nexamples of how and where this low-friction \ntechnology is already operating globally at scale with \nleading web platforms. \nEvery month, AI-driven facial age estimation \ntechnology already enables tens of millions of adults \nto verify their age in about one second. The facial \nimage is not stored and there is no reliance on any \nidentity documentation. This technology enables \nplatforms to easily distinguish an adult from a minor \nat a global scale and in the volumes required for global \nplatforms such as Meta. \nWith the user\u2019s consent, Yoti can store the results of a \npreviously completed facial age estimation on the \nuser\u2019s device as a reusable digital ID or wallet. This \ndigital ID or wallet can then be utilized to access any \nwebsite containing adult content. \nTaking this technology one step further, reusable \napproaches, termed \u2018tokens,\u2019 are now available so \nrepeat visitors to an age-gated website, such as adult \ncontent websites, can prove their age once and then \ncontinue to use the generated age verification token \nindefinitely. The French government is the first \ngovernment to issue guidelines authorizing the use of \ntokens as an appropriate method of age verification, \nbeginning when age verification for adult content \ncomes into force in France in January 2025.12 \n \n12 https://www.arcom.fr/nos-ressources/espace-juridique/textes-\njuridiques/referentiel-technique-sur-la-verification-de-lage-\npour-la-protection-des-mineurs-contre-la-pornographie-en-ligne \n\n \n6 \nThere is a range of fallback options and exciting new \npossibilities for how visitors to age-gated websites can \nprove their age and only share their adult status, \nwhile ensuring privacy and security across platforms \nand websites. \nA. \nAge Verification Technology Does \nNot Impose Categorically Different \nBurdens on Adults and is Akin to \nIn-Person Age Verification \nAt a bar, bartenders routinely inspect an individual \nand, based on an initial estimation of their age, decide \nwhether to request a physical identification document \nsuch as a driver's license. To complete manual age \nverification, a government-issued identity document \nneeds to be reviewed to determine whether it is a bona \nfide document, whether the image of the person in the \ndocument matches the person presenting it, and check \nthe date of birth to ascertain if the person is old \nenough to consume alcohol. \nIn today\u2019s online world, platforms are already \nharnessing a range of technologies to assess age, \nfrequently working with independent age verification \nproviders. Platforms can select a range of age \nverification options to offer customers a choice and can \nmake their own determination about what range of \noptions suits their customers, accounting for different \nmarkets, regulatory requirements, and demographics. \nOne technological method emulates the human ability \nto estimate age, as demonstrated by the bartender \nexample of someone with years of experience \ndiscerning adults from minors \u2013 this is facial age \nestimate. \n\n \n7 \nSome age verification methods build on the physical \nreview of the document model by technologically \nchecking the document\u2019s authenticity and then \nchecking that the person presenting it is, in fact, the \nrightful owner. \nThis technology typically utilizes ID document \ndatabases to determine if the format of the document \nbeing presented is authentic, liveness detection to \nensure that the person presenting the document is \nalive, and face matching to compare the person \npresenting the document to the face on the document. \nIn addition, depending on the circumstances, it may \nbe necessary to verify individuals using data points \nfrom authoritative sources such as department of \nmotor vehicle databases, voter registration records, or \ncredit reference databases. \nIt is common for visitors of adult content websites to \nvisit numerous sites over several hours. Since it is \ninconvenient and excessive for such users to undergo \nage verification every time they access adult websites, \nthe age verification technology industry has developed \nreusable tokens that allow users to repeatedly visit \nadult content sites without undergoing repeated age \nverification checks. \nThe typical adult content site consists of an initial \n\u2018landing page\u2019 that can offer several types of age \nverification options, enabling the consumer to pick the \none they prefer. Some methods may involve just one \nor two clicks and take just one or two seconds, \nequivalent to or less than the time it takes a bartender \nto do a visual estimation and ask an individual to dig \nout their ID from their wallet, hand it over, and \npresent it for inspection. \n\n \n8 \nCurrent age verification methods include: \n1. \nEstimating age from a user\u2019s \nfacial image using AI facial \nage estimation technology \nIn everyday life, we are all human age estimators; we \nsubconsciously assess the ages of those we encounter, \ndrawing on our lived experience. Consider a long-\ntenured high school principal. His experience dealing \nwith teenagers would make him more accurate than \nthe average adult at differentiating those under 18 \nfrom those over 18. \nThe most developed age estimation approach, which \nhas been around for over a decade, utilizes a facial \nimage. This image-based technology was initially \nreviewed by NIST over a decade ago and is now part \nof an ongoing NIST benchmarking assessment13 and \nis currently under review by nationally accredited \naudit bodies such as the Age Check Certification \nScheme (ACCS)14 with well-established companies \nsuch as Google, Fujitsu, Idemia providing this service. \nBased on NIST data, these models are likely to be \naccurate within one to three years of the individual\u2019s \nage, depending on the age range. Specifically, the \naccuracy for younger individuals is approximately 1 to \n1.5 years, whereas the accuracy for older individuals \nis around 2-4 years. There is higher accuracy for \nyounger versus older people given that physical \nappearance is impacted over time in relation to the \n \n13 https://pages.nist.gov/frvt/html/frvt_age_estimation.html \n14 See https://accscheme.com/ and \nhttps://accscheme.com/registry/ \n\n \n9 \nindividual\u2019s lived experience. The error rate increases \nwith age, as well. \nWhen a visitor arrives on an adult website landing \npage, the request to prove age may appear in a new \nwindow or a pop-up frame. Most adult content users \naccess websites using mobile devices and are asked to \ntake a photo using their phone\u2019s camera. Desktop \nusers can do the same via their laptop webcam. \nFacial \nage \nestimation \ntechnology \ndetermines \nsomeone\u2019s age using a facial image. The user simply \nlooks at the camera on their device, positions their \nface in the oval shape provided, and takes their photo. \nThe image is then analyzed by an algorithm trained \nto determine age by analyzing facial features from a \ndiverse training set of images where the actual age \nwas known in months and years. \nTo the software model, the new image presented is \nsimply a pattern of pixels, and the pixels are numbers. \nFacial age estimation technology has been trained to \nspot patterns in numbers and pinpoint how people of \na particular age appear in those number patterns. The \nfacial age estimation process usually takes less than \none second. It can produce either a yes/no result on \nwhether the individual in the image meets a \ndesignated age threshold or an estimated age. The \nimage is assessed directly and there is no need to store \nit, so nothing is stored, ensuring the visitor\u2019s privacy. \nIf the visitor meets the age required (e.g., 18+), the age \nestimation technology confirms to the adult website \nthat the user can proceed, and the user can then \naccess the adult content on the website. \n\n \n10 \nA website operator can require an \u2018age buffer\u2019 in years \nabove the age of access. For example, the website \noperator could decide that if the age of access is 18 \nyears and a method is accurate to within 1 to 1.5 \nyears, then this method can be used by all visitors who \nare, for instance, two, three, or five years older than \nthe necessary age, translating to 20, 21 or 23 years \nold. Visitors within this buffer\u2014below 20 in this \nexample\u2014will need to use an additional age \nverification check to help pinpoint their age. \nIn Yoti\u2019s publicly accessible white papers, we \nregularly publish the mean absolute errors, false \npositives, and false negatives for each age group \nacross gender and skin tone. In our most recent white \npaper, published in September 2024, the Yoti \nalgorithm produces a true positive rate for thirteen- to \nseventeen-year-old minors as correctly estimated as \nunder age twenty-one 99.2% of the time. The false \npositives rate reveals that under 1% of fourteen to \nseventeen-year-olds incorrectly judged to be over age \ntwenty-one as 0.03% for fourteen-year-olds, 0.34% for \nfifteen-year-olds, 0.73% for sixteen-year-olds and \n2.43% of seventeen-year-olds.15 \nUsing modern age verification technology, all adults \nabove age twenty or twenty-one can easily and \nsecurely assert their adult status in a privacy-ensured \nway in around one second. This method is highly \naccurate against different ages and skin tones, where \nthe technology is consistently trained at scale and \n \n15 https://www.yoti.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Yoti-Age-\nEstimation-White-Paper-September-2024-PUBLIC.pdf page 31. \n\n \n11 \nusing artificial intelligence is constantly improving \nover time. \nTo achieve a high level of assurance, facial age \nestimation should always be used in combination with \nliveness detection\u2013 including both presentation and \ninjection attack detection\u2013 and be subject to \ncontinuous independent testing and monitoring. \nLiveness checks prevent people from using a photo, \nvideo, or mask instead of taking a live photo. Facial \ninjection attack detection ensures that the image \nbeing analyzed originates from a live source, such as \nthe device camera, and not from a fraudulent or pre-\nrecorded \ninput. \nThis \ntechnique \nverifies \nthe \nauthenticity of the face by distinguishing between \nreal-time facial data and injected, manipulated, or \nreplayed images, helping to prevent spoofing or \nunauthorized access. \nWith the rise of generative AI technology and \ndeepfakes to circumvent age verification checks, the \nability to prevent direct and indirect injection attacks \nis also required.16 Website operators must identify \nand prevent sophisticated injection attacks, ensuring \nthat the images captured during a verification process \nare genuine and remain untampered with.17 \nThe ongoing large scale NIST evaluation uses over 11 \nmillion data points and provides scientific certainty \nfor businesses and governments that facial age \nestimation is an accurate, fair, and privacy-preserving \n \n16 https://www.yoti.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Yoti-How-\nto-combat-Generative-AI-and-deepfakes-white-paper.pdf \n17 https://www.yoti.com/blog/yoti-releases-white-paper-\ndetailing-approach-to-combating-generative-ai-and-deepfakes/ \n\n \n12 \nage assurance solution.18 Audit bodies such as ACCS \nhave been auditing facial age estimation since 2020. \nThey also provide testing, using high-quality test \nimages captured from mobile phones, to provide \ntesting conditions closer to those of adult content and \nsocial media companies. \nFacial age estimation has been approved by a range of \nregulators as a method for age verification to access \nadult content: the German regulators (KJM and FSM) \nhave been using it since 2021 with a 5-year buffer. The \nFrench content and data protection regulators (Arcom \nand CNIL) and the UK data protection and content \nregulators (ICO and OFCOM) clearly state it as an \nappropriate method. \n2. \nDocument-based verification \nusing a physical identity \ndocument \nFor individuals within a defined buffer zone\u2014for \nexample between the ages of eighteen and twenty-\none\u2014other forms of verification, such as document-\nbased verification, can be utilized as a fallback or \nsupplemental method of establishing age. \nDocument-based verification requires assurances that \nthe actual owner of the document is the person \nproviding the document. So, in the same way a \nthorough bartender will carefully compare the \ndocument to the person presenting it, effective online \ndocument-based age verification requires document \nauthenticity checks, face matching, and liveness \nverification. Using these three steps, website \n \n18 https://pages.nist.gov/frvt/reports/aev/fate_aev_report.pdf \n\n \n13 \noperators have a high level of assurance that the \ndocument is authentic, belongs to the right person, \nand that the document owner is the person presenting \nthe document at that discrete moment in time. \nDocument-based age verification technology and \nhuman analysts in Yoti\u2019s 24-hour data security \ncenters review documents to detect a range of fraud \nvectors, including fake, tampered-with, borrowed, or \ncounterfeit documents. \nSharing an identity document might be perceived as \ndisclosing more individually identifying details, such \nas name, nationality, and address, alongside a live \nfacial scan; however, in actuality, just the anonymized \nage attribute or \u201cage over\u201d such as \u201c18\u201d is shared with \nthe adult content site. \nThe Yoti terms of service and industry best practices, \nalong with legal and regulatory requirements in the \nUK and EU, require that only the age result is \ntransferred and that any personal data captured as \npart of a one-time upload of an identity document \nverification check is promptly deleted after the age \nverification check is completed. \n3. \nChecking against databases, \ncredit reference agencies, \nmobile phone operators, and \nother semi-public data \nsources \nThere are a number of techniques that have long been \nused for Know Your Customer checks in financial \nservices and gambling, and as in the example above, \nthey can also be utilized to determine whether a user \nis an adult or a minor. \n\n \n14 \n4. \nReusable digital identity apps \nRepeatedly undergoing age verification checks is not \nonly tiresome, but it can limit users\u2019 engagement and \naccess to legally accessible content. Especially for \nusers close in age to legal adulthood, a more \npermanent method of assuring age is possible by \nusing a digital identity app that allows them to \nestablish their age once and then utilize this proof of \nage in many different contexts, on many different \nwebsites and platforms. \nIn addition to storing document-based verification, a \ndigital ID app can utilize facial age estimation to \nvalidate age once and then share that verification \nwhen required across the Internet. In the physical \nworld, a location might allow visitors seeking access \nto an adult venue to scan a QR code and share a \nverified age estimation via a reusable digital identity \napp. \nIn the online world, a digital identity app simply \ncertifies that the visitor is an adult through a simple \n\u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d check. Nothing further is shared with the \nwebsite operator, and no personal information is \nrevealed, ensuring complete privacy for the user. \n5. \nAge assurance tokens in \nwhich validation on one \nwebsite is transferrable to \nanother website \nAll the above age assurance options can be \nindependently assessed, accredited, and tokenized. \nWebsites can determine which methods they accept, \nwhether to tokenize, and the duration of the tokens. \n\n \n15 \nUsing tokens decreases the costs for relying parties \nand can further reduce any burden by the visitor to \nkeep verifying their age at each adult site they visit. \nAge assurance tokens allow a visitor to determine \ntheir age once using any of the methods above and \nthen use that same verification repeatedly across \nwebsites. An anonymous cookie is added to their \nbrowser which is then accessed by subsequent \nwebsites. Tokens don\u2019t contain any identifiable \ninformation, just the age verification result and \ninformation about how the check was performed. \nTokens can be stored in a confidential age verification \naccount, cached, and utilized over and over again \nindefinitely. \nUsers can pass their age tokens to another browser or, \nafter clearing their cache, by logging on to their age \nverification account. Once cached or re-cached, users \ncan freely visit other sites that accept the token \ncriteria. If a user visits a site with different criteria, \nsuch as a higher age threshold or one requiring a more \nrecently issued token, the user will be asked to \nundertake a new age verification. \nThe information shared with the relying party is the \nsum of the token\u2019s information, as detailed above. This \ncomprises the method of age assurance used, the type \nof age recorded\u2014such as age over, age under, or age \nrange\u2014the issuer of the age token, the type of liveness \ncheck performed, the type of authenticity check \nperformed, and the time and date the check was \nperformed. \n\n \n16 \nB. \nAge Verification Technology Does \nNot Unreasonably Implicate or \nIntrude Upon the Privacy of Adults \nUsing modern age verification technology, as soon as \na visitor\u2019s age is estimated, their facial image is \ndeleted, ensuring their privacy at all times. Visitors \ndo not need to provide personal details like their name \nor date of birth or share any identity documents. The \ntechnology is specifically designed not to identify \nanyone. Unlike facial-recognition technology, age \nverification technology estimates someone\u2019s age \nwithout identity matching that person or acq\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

ACLU (Ashcroft II), 542 U.S. 656 (2004), \nthe \nCourt \nconsidered \na \ncontent-based \nspeech \nrestriction on sexually explicit materials on the \nInternet that Congress deemed harmful to minors. In \nconsidering this question, the Court assumed that \ncertain protected speech may be regulated, with the \nkey consideration being determining the least \nrestrictive alternative that can be used to achieve that \ngoal. In Ashcroft II, blocking and filtering software \nwas found to be the least restrictive alternative. In \nthis case, age verification technology is proposed as \nthe least restrictive alternative to achieving Texas\u2019s \nuncontested goal of protecting minors from obscene \ncontent on the Internet. \nThe Court in Ashcroft II conducted an in-depth \nanalysis of the viability and effectiveness of filtering \nsoftware circa February 1999\u2014over 25 years ago. The \nCourt found that this technological solution was the \nleast restrictive means of regulating Internet \nobscenity, with the crucial caveat that \u201cit is \nreasonable to assume that other technological \ndevelopments important to the First Amendment \nanalysis have also occurred during that time.\u201d Id. at \n671. \nThis \namicus \nbrief \nis \nabout \n\u201ctechnological \ndevelopments important to the First Amendment \nanalysis,\u201d acknowledging the Court\u2019s finding that \u201cthe \ntechnology of the Internet evolves at a rapid pace.\u201d Id. \nIn this case, the District Court soundly rejected age \nverification technology in favor of content filtering \nsoftware, while the Fifth Circuit held that Texas\u2019s \n\n \n4 \n\u201cage \nverification \nrequirement \nlikely \npasses \nconstitutional \nmuster \nunder \nthe \nrational-basis \nstandard in Ginsberg.\u201d Pet.App.27a. \nUnderstanding \nage \nverification \ntechnologies \nis \nessential to deciding whether their application is the \nleast \nrestrictive \nalternative \nunder \nthe \nFirst \nAmendment. \nARGUMENT \nI. \nAge Verification Technology is the Least \nRestrictive Alternative and is Narrowly \nTailored to Achieve Texas\u2019s Well-Founded \nGoal of Protecting Minors from Obscene \nContent on the Internet \nThis brief outlines practical examples of how current \nage verification technology (also known as age \nassurance technology) is working today, focusing on \nartificial intelligence (AI) driven facial age estimation. \nAI facial age estimation is the most popular age \nverification technology with individuals and the most \nprevalent approach by volume. It does not require \nusing an identity document or other identity data, nor \ndoes it require using facial recognition technology. No \ndatabase is created; no images are stored. The \nalgorithm does not learn anything from each \nadditional age check undertaken. \nYoti Ltd., a worldwide leader in age verification, offers \na wide range of approaches, and has undertaken over \n700 million age checks. Yoti is therefore uniquely \nqualified to explain the ease of use, accuracy, \naffordability, security, effectiveness, and accessibility, \nincluding details on how AI-driven facial age \n\n \n5 \nestimation \nmeets \nrigorous \ndata \nprotection \nrequirements to preserve privacy. This brief details \nexamples of how and where this low-friction \ntechnology is already operating globally at scale with \nleading web platforms. \nEvery month, AI-driven facial age estimation \ntechnology already enables tens of millions of adults \nto verify their age in about one second. The facial \nimage is not stored and there is no reliance on any \nidentity documentation. This technology enables \nplatforms to easily distinguish an adult from a minor \nat a global scale and in the volumes required for global \nplatforms such as Meta. \nWith the user\u2019s consent, Yoti can store the results of a \npreviously completed facial age estimation on the \nuser\u2019s device as a reusable digital ID or wallet. This \ndigital ID or wallet can then be utilized to access any \nwebsite containing adult content. \nTaking this technology one step further, reusable \napproaches, termed \u2018tokens,\u2019 are now available so \nrepeat visitors to an age-gated website, such as adult \ncontent websites, can prove their age once and then \ncontinue to use the generated age verification token \nindefinitely. The French government is the first \ngovernment to issue guidelines authorizing the use of \ntokens as an appropriate method of age verification, \nbeginning when age verification for adult content \ncomes into force in France in January 2025.12 \n \n12 https://www.arcom.fr/nos-ressources/espace-juridique/textes-\njuridiques/referentiel-technique-sur-la-verification-de-lage-\npour-la-protection-des-mineurs-contre-la-pornographie-en-ligne \n\n \n6 \nThere is a range of fallback options and exciting new \npossibilities for how visitors to age-gated websites can \nprove their age and only share their adult status, \nwhile ensuring privacy and security across platforms \nand websites. \nA. \nAge Verification Technology Does \nNot Impose Categorically Different \nBurdens on Adults and is Akin to \nIn-Person Age Verification \nAt a bar, bartenders routinely inspect an individual \nand, based on an initial estimation of their age, decide \nwhether to request a physical identification document \nsuch as a driver's license. To complete manual age \nverification, a government-issued identity document \nneeds to be reviewed to determine whether it is a bona \nfide document, whether the image of the person in the \ndocument matches the person presenting it, and check \nthe date of birth to ascertain if the person is old \nenough to consume alcohol. \nIn today\u2019s online world, platforms are already \nharnessing a range of technologies to assess age, \nfrequently working with independent age verification \nproviders. Platforms can select a range of age \nverification options to offer customers a choice and can \nmake their own determination about what range of \noptions suits their customers, accounting for different \nmarkets, regulatory requirements, and demographics. \nOne technological method emulates the human ability \nto estimate age, as demonstrated by the bartender \nexample of someone with years of experience \ndiscerning adults from minors \u2013 this is facial age \nestimate. \n\n \n7 \nSome age verification methods build on the physical \nreview of the document model by technologically \nchecking the document\u2019s authenticity and then \nchecking that the person presenting it is, in fact, the \nrightful owner. \nThis technology typically utilizes ID document \ndatabases to determine if the format of the document \nbeing presented is authentic, liveness detection to \nensure that the person presenting the document is \nalive, and face matching to compare the person \npresenting the document to the face on the document. \nIn addition, depending on the circumstances, it may \nbe necessary to verify individuals using data points \nfrom authoritative sources such as department of \nmotor vehicle databases, voter registration records, or \ncredit reference databases. \nIt is common for visitors of adult content websites to \nvisit numerous sites over several hours. Since it is \ninconvenient and excessive for such users to undergo \nage verification every time they access adult websites, \nthe age verification technology industry has developed \nreusable tokens that allow users to repeatedly visit \nadult content sites without undergoing repeated age \nverification checks. \nThe typical adult content site consists of an initial \n\u2018landing page\u2019 that can offer several types of age \nverification options, enabling the consumer to pick the \none they prefer. Some methods may involve just one \nor two clicks and take just one or two seconds, \nequivalent to or less than the time it takes a bartender \nto do a visual estimation and ask an individual to dig \nout their ID from their wallet, hand it over, and \npresent it for inspection. \n\n \n8 \nCurrent age verification methods include: \n1. \nEstimating age from a user\u2019s \nfacial image using AI facial \nage estimation technology \nIn everyday life, we are all human age estimators; we \nsubconsciously assess the ages of those we encounter, \ndrawing on our lived experience. Consider a long-\ntenured high school principal. His experience dealing \nwith teenagers would make him more accurate than \nthe average adult at differentiating those under 18 \nfrom those over 18. \nThe most developed age estimation approach, which \nhas been around for over a decade, utilizes a facial \nimage. This image-based technology was initially \nreviewed by NIST over a decade ago and is now part \nof an ongoing NIST benchmarking assessment13 and \nis currently under review by nationally accredited \naudit bodies such as the Age Check Certification \nScheme (ACCS)14 with well-established companies \nsuch as Google, Fujitsu, Idemia providing this service. \nBased on NIST data, these models are likely to be \naccurate within one to three years of the individual\u2019s \nage, depending on the age range. Specifically, the \naccuracy for younger individuals is approximately 1 to \n1.5 years, whereas the accuracy for older individuals \nis around 2-4 years. There is higher accuracy for \nyounger versus older people given that physical \nappearance is impacted over time in relation to the \n \n13 https://pages.nist.gov/frvt/html/frvt_age_estimation.html \n14 See https://accscheme.com/ and \nhttps://accscheme.com/registry/ \n\n \n9 \nindividual\u2019s lived experience. The error rate increases \nwith age, as well. \nWhen a visitor arrives on an adult website landing \npage, the request to prove age may appear in a new \nwindow or a pop-up frame. Most adult content users \naccess websites using mobile devices and are asked to \ntake a photo using their phone\u2019s camera. Desktop \nusers can do the same via their laptop webcam. \nFacial \nage \nestimation \ntechnology \ndetermines \nsomeone\u2019s age using a facial image. The user simply \nlooks at the camera on their device, positions their \nface in the oval shape provided, and takes their photo. \nThe image is then analyzed by an algorithm trained \nto determine age by analyzing facial features from a \ndiverse training set of images where the actual age \nwas known in months and years. \nTo the software model, the new image presented is \nsimply a pattern of pixels, and the pixels are numbers. \nFacial age estimation technology has been trained to \nspot patterns in numbers and pinpoint how people of \na particular age appear in those number patterns. The \nfacial age estimation process usually takes less than \none second. It can produce either a yes/no result on \nwhether the individual in the image meets a \ndesignated age threshold or an estimated age. The \nimage is assessed directly and there is no need to store \nit, so nothing is stored, ensuring the visitor\u2019s privacy. \nIf the visitor meets the age required (e.g., 18+), the age \nestimation technology confirms to the adult website \nthat the user can proceed, and the user can then \naccess the adult content on the website. \n\n \n10 \nA website operator can require an \u2018age buffer\u2019 in years \nabove the age of access. For example, the website \noperator could decide that if the age of access is 18 \nyears and a method is accurate to within 1 to 1.5 \nyears, then this method can be used by all visitors who \nare, for instance, two, three, or five years older than \nthe necessary age, translating to 20, 21 or 23 years \nold. Visitors within this buffer\u2014below 20 in this \nexample\u2014will need to use an additional age \nverification check to help pinpoint their age. \nIn Yoti\u2019s publicly accessible white papers, we \nregularly publish the mean absolute errors, false \npositives, and false negatives for each age group \nacross gender and skin tone. In our most recent white \npaper, published in September 2024, the Yoti \nalgorithm produces a true positive rate for thirteen- to \nseventeen-year-old minors as correctly estimated as \nunder age twenty-one 99.2% of the time. The false \npositives rate reveals that under 1% of fourteen to \nseventeen-year-olds incorrectly judged to be over age \ntwenty-one as 0.03% for fourteen-year-olds, 0.34% for \nfifteen-year-olds, 0.73% for sixteen-year-olds and \n2.43% of seventeen-year-olds.15 \nUsing modern age verification technology, all adults \nabove age twenty or twenty-one can easily and \nsecurely assert their adult status in a privacy-ensured \nway in around one second. This method is highly \naccurate against different ages and skin tones, where \nthe technology is consistently trained at scale and \n \n15 https://www.yoti.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Yoti-Age-\nEstimation-White-Paper-September-2024-PUBLIC.pdf page 31. \n\n \n11 \nusing artificial intelligence is constantly improving \nover time. \nTo achieve a high level of assurance, facial age \nestimation should always be used in combination with \nliveness detection\u2013 including both presentation and \ninjection attack detection\u2013 and be subject to \ncontinuous independent testing and monitoring. \nLiveness checks prevent people from using a photo, \nvideo, or mask instead of taking a live photo. Facial \ninjection attack detection ensures that the image \nbeing analyzed originates from a live source, such as \nthe device camera, and not from a fraudulent or pre-\nrecorded \ninput. \nThis \ntechnique \nverifies \nthe \nauthenticity of the face by distinguishing between \nreal-time facial data and injected, manipulated, or \nreplayed images, helping to prevent spoofing or \nunauthorized access. \nWith the rise of generative AI technology and \ndeepfakes to circumvent age verification checks, the \nability to prevent direct and indirect injection attacks \nis also required.16 Website operators must identify \nand prevent sophisticated injection attacks, ensuring \nthat the images captured during a verification process \nare genuine and remain untampered with.17 \nThe ongoing large scale NIST evaluation uses over 11 \nmillion data points and provides scientific certainty \nfor businesses and governments that facial age \nestimation is an accurate, fair, and privacy-preserving \n \n16 https://www.yoti.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Yoti-How-\nto-combat-Generative-AI-and-deepfakes-white-paper.pdf \n17 https://www.yoti.com/blog/yoti-releases-white-paper-\ndetailing-approach-to-combating-generative-ai-and-deepfakes/ \n\n \n12 \nage assurance solution.18 Audit bodies such as ACCS \nhave been auditing facial age estimation since 2020. \nThey also provide testing, using high-quality test \nimages captured from mobile phones, to provide \ntesting conditions closer to those of adult content and \nsocial media companies. \nFacial age estimation has been approved by a range of \nregulators as a method for age verification to access \nadult content: the German regulators (KJM and FSM) \nhave been using it since 2021 with a 5-year buffer. The \nFrench content and data protection regulators (Arcom \nand CNIL) and the UK data protection and content \nregulators (ICO and OFCOM) clearly state it as an \nappropriate method. \n2. \nDocument-based verification \nusing a physical identity \ndocument \nFor individuals within a defined buffer zone\u2014for \nexample between the ages of eighteen and twenty-\none\u2014other forms of verification, such as document-\nbased verification, can be utilized as a fallback or \nsupplemental method of establishing age. \nDocument-based verification requires assurances that \nthe actual owner of the document is the person \nproviding the document. So, in the same way a \nthorough bartender will carefully compare the \ndocument to the person presenting it, effective online \ndocument-based age verification requires document \nauthenticity checks, face matching, and liveness \nverification. Using these three steps, website \n \n18 https://pages.nist.gov/frvt/reports/aev/fate_aev_report.pdf \n\n \n13 \noperators have a high level of assurance that the \ndocument is authentic, belongs to the right person, \nand that the document owner is the person presenting \nthe document at that discrete moment in time. \nDocument-based age verification technology and \nhuman analysts in Yoti\u2019s 24-hour data security \ncenters review documents to detect a range of fraud \nvectors, including fake, tampered-with, borrowed, or \ncounterfeit documents. \nSharing an identity document might be perceived as \ndisclosing more individually identifying details, such \nas name, nationality, and address, alongside a live \nfacial scan; however, in actuality, just the anonymized \nage attribute or \u201cage over\u201d such as \u201c18\u201d is shared with \nthe adult content site. \nThe Yoti terms of service and industry best practices, \nalong with legal and regulatory requirements in the \nUK and EU, require that only the age result is \ntransferred and that any personal data captured as \npart of a one-time upload of an identity document \nverification check is promptly deleted after the age \nverification check is completed. \n3. \nChecking against databases, \ncredit reference agencies, \nmobile phone operators, and \nother semi-public data \nsources \nThere are a number of techniques that have long been \nused for Know Your Customer checks in financial \nservices and gambling, and as in the example above, \nthey can also be utilized to determine whether a user \nis an adult or a minor. \n\n \n14 \n4. \nReusable digital identity apps \nRepeatedly undergoing age verification checks is not \nonly tiresome, but it can limit users\u2019 engagement and \naccess to legally accessible content. Especially for \nusers close in age to legal adulthood, a more \npermanent method of assuring age is possible by \nusing a digital identity app that allows them to \nestablish their age once and then utilize this proof of \nage in many different contexts, on many different \nwebsites and platforms. \nIn addition to storing document-based verification, a \ndigital ID app can utilize facial age estimation to \nvalidate age once and then share that verification \nwhen required across the Internet. In the physical \nworld, a location might allow visitors seeking access \nto an adult venue to scan a QR code and share a \nverified age estimation via a reusable digital identity \napp. \nIn the online world, a digital identity app simply \ncertifies that the visitor is an adult through a simple \n\u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d check. Nothing further is shared with the \nwebsite operator, and no personal information is \nrevealed, ensuring complete privacy for the user. \n5. \nAge assurance tokens in \nwhich validation on one \nwebsite is transferrable to \nanother website \nAll the above age assurance options can be \nindependently assessed, accredited, and tokenized. \nWebsites can determine which methods they accept, \nwhether to tokenize, and the duration of the tokens. \n\n \n15 \nUsing tokens decreases the costs for relying parties \nand can further reduce any burden by the visitor to \nkeep verifying their age at each adult site they visit. \nAge assurance tokens allow a visitor to determine \ntheir age once using any of the methods above and \nthen use that same verification repeatedly across \nwebsites. An anonymous cookie is added to their \nbrowser which is then accessed by subsequent \nwebsites. Tokens don\u2019t contain any identifiable \ninformation, just the age verification result and \ninformation about how the check was performed. \nTokens can be stored in a confidential age verification \naccount, cached, and utilized over and over again \nindefinitely. \nUsers can pass their age tokens to another browser or, \nafter clearing their cache, by logging on to their age \nverification account. Once cached or re-cached, users \ncan freely visit other sites that accept the token \ncriteria. If a user visits a site with different criteria, \nsuch as a higher age threshold or one requiring a more \nrecently issued token, the user will be asked to \nundertake a new age verification. \nThe information shared with the relying party is the \nsum of the token\u2019s information, as detailed above. This \ncomprises the method of age assurance used, the type \nof age recorded\u2014such as age over, age under, or age \nrange\u2014the issuer of the age token, the type of liveness \ncheck performed, the type of authenticity check \nperformed, and the time and date the check was \nperformed. \n\n \n16 \nB. \nAge Verification Technology Does \nNot Unreasonably Implicate or \nIntrude Upon the Privacy of Adults \nUsing modern age verification technology, as soon as \na visitor\u2019s age is estimated, their facial image is \ndeleted, ensuring their privacy at all times. Visitors \ndo not need to provide personal details like their name \nor date of birth or share any identity documents. The \ntechnology is specifically designed not to identify \nanyone. Unlike facial-recognition technology, age \nverification technology estimates someone\u2019s age \nwithout identity matching that person or acquiring \nany details from them other than the facial image \nwhich is instantly assessed and then is no longer \nneeded, and therefore does not need to be stored.19 \nC. \nAge Verification Technology is \nCurrently being Successfully \nUtilized Worldwide \nMany of the largest and most successful social media, \nadult content websites, and gaming platforms already \nuse age verification technology, with millions of \nchecks being conducted monthly. \n \n \n \n \n19 https://ico.org.uk/media/for-\norganisations/documents/4020427/yoti-sandbox-\nexit_report_20220522.pdf \n\n \n17 \n \nExamples include: \nMeta, \nincluding \nFacebook \nDating, \nInstagram, and, more recently, Instagram \nTeen Accounts, utilizes age verification \ntechnology to support age-appropriate \naccess to these services. When Facebook \nDating and Instagram detect a user \nattempting to change their date of birth \nfrom under 18 to over 18, they deploy Yoti\u2019s \nfacial age estimation as one of the ways the \nperson can establish that they are an adult. \nThis tool has been deployed by Meta since \n2022. Meta recently introduced Instagram \nTeen \nAccounts \nwith \nbuilt-in \ndefault \nprotections limiting who can contact and \nthe content teen users can access. Teens \nunder sixteen need an adult\u2019s permission to \nuse less protective settings. For teen users \nwho want to switch to an adult account, \nInstagram uses Yoti facial age estimation, \namong other tools, to establish eligibility \nfor such an account. \n\n \n18 \nOnlyFans, \na \nsubscription-based \nsocial \nmedia platform for adults where both \ncreators and subscribers must be over \neighteen, \ndeploys \nage \nverification \ntechnology in many countries to ensure \nthat those engaging with the platform are \nadults. \nYubo, \na \nlive-streaming \nsocial \nmedia \nplatform with almost 60 million users, \noffers a service for adults and a separate \nservice for thirteen to seventeen-year-olds. \nSince 2022, Yubo has been using facial age \nestimation as its first point of contact to \nensure that users are old enough and \nprovided access to the proper content. Yubo \nemploys a fallback option for users close to \nage 18, such as using the Yoti reusable \ndigital ID app or a one-time document \nsubmission. \nD. \nTexas Can Impose a Content-Based \nSpeech Restriction on Sexually \nExplicit Materials on the Internet \nEven if it Results in a Cost to the \nWebsites and Platforms Hosting the \nContent \nCost is an understated but important issue in deciding \nthe least restrictive means of regulating Internet \nobscenity. The end user almost always bears the cost \nof blocking and filtering software, while the website \nprofiting from obscenity and adult content almost \nalways bears the cost of age verification technology. \nCost-shifting refers to allocating a policy or practice\u2019s \n\n \n19 \nexpenses or financial burdens to one party while \nallowing others to shirk or reduce these costs. \nUnder the First Amendment, the government cannot \nimpose a financial burden on speakers based on the \ncontent of their speech. Rosenberger v. Rector & \nVisitors of Univ. of Virginia, 515 U.S. 819, 828 (1995). \nHowever, imposing a cost is permissible if it is \n\u201cdesigned to meet the expenses incident to the \nadministration of the law.\u201d Forsyth Cnty., Ga. v. \nNationalist Movement, 505 U.S. 123, 129 n. 8 (1992). \nOne example is requiring fees and paid permits for \ngroups \nand \nindividuals \nexercising \ntheir \nFirst \nAmendment right to protest. Concerning permit fees, \nthe Supreme Court has ruled that costs must be \nreasonable and not prohibitively expensive, that they \ncannot be based on the content of the speech or the \nviewpoint of the demonstrators, and that they \ntypically cover administrative expenses such as \nprocessing the permit application, coordinating with \nlaw enforcement, and ensuring public safety during \nthe event. See e.g. iMatter Utah v. Njord, 774 F.3d \n1258 (10th Cir. 2014); Surita v. Hyde, 665 F.3d 860 \n(7th Cir. 2011). \nThe same principles can be applied when online adult \ncontent providers require age verification. In the case \nof age verification, cost-shifting legitimately places \nthe cost of age verification technology on the providers \nof adult content rather than on the consumers who \nwould otherwise incur costs by having to install and \nmaintain monitoring and filtering software on their \nown devices. Since the costs of operating and \nmaintaining modern age verification technology are \nno longer prohibitively expensive or unreasonable, \n\n \n20 \nrequiring adult websites to incur these costs does not \nviolate the websites\u2019 First Amendment rights.20  \nFurthermore, this cost evaluation does not consider \nthe actual negative societal costs when minors can \naccess explicit adult content, nor does it consider the \nundue burden that parents incur for the entire \nresponsibility of filtering, monitoring, and installing \nmonitoring and filtering software on their children\u2019s \nand shared family devices. \nWhen it comes to obscenity, the government has a \nmuch wider latitude to determine and impose costs, \nboth tangible and intangible. In Paris Adult Theatre I \nv. Slaton, 413 U.S. 49, 57\u201358 (1973), the Court held \nthat \u201cthere are legitimate state interests at stake in \nstemming the tide of commercialized obscenity, even \nassuming it is feasible to enforce effective safeguards \nagainst exposure to juveniles and to passersby. Rights \nand interests \u2018other than those of the advocates are \ninvolved.\u2019 These include the interest of the public in \nthe quality of life and the total community \nenvironment, the tone of commerce in the great city \ncenters, and, possibly, the public safety itself.\u201d \nInternal citations removed. \n \n \n \n20 See Declaration of Tony Allen: \u201cYoti state that their Age \nVerification Service (AVS) pricing ranges between $0.03 (for \nlarge volumes e.g. circa 100 M, $0.10 for circa 5M checks and \n$0.31 for lower volumes, one time account based checks e.g. \nunder 100,000). They also offer free, $0.0 shares of 18 plus \nattributes from the reusable Yoti digital identity app\u2026.\u201d \nJ.A.201. \n\n \n21 \nCONCLUSION \n\u201cUnderstandably those who entertain an absolutist \nview of the First Amendment find it uncomfortable to \nexplain why rights of association, speech, and press \nshould be severely restrained in the marketplace of \ngoods and money, but not in the marketplace of \npornography.\u201d Paris Adult Theatre I v. Slaton, 413 \nU.S. 49, 60\u201362 (1973). \nConsidering the arguments presented, it is evident \nthat \ncurrent \nage \nverification \ntechnologies, \nparticularly AI facial age estimation, offer practical, \nprivacy-preserving, and scalable solutions for online \nage verification. This technology provides a secure \nand efficient method for websites and platforms to \ncomply with legal requirements while respecting user \nprivacy. The methods outlined, including the reuse of \nage tokens and digital identity apps, further reduce \nuser friction while maintaining high accuracy and \nsecurity at a low cost. \nGiven the demonstrated effectiveness of these \ntechnologies in protecting minors and enabling adults \nto assert their age without unnecessary intrusion, the \nCourt should recognize that AI-driven facial age \nestimation \nsolutions \nare \nthe \nleast \nrestrictive \nalternative under the First Amendment when \nrestricting sexually explicit materials on the Internet. \nFor these reasons, Yoti Ltd. respectfully submits that \nthe Court should support the implementation of these \nadvanced age assurance technologies as a reliable \nmethod to comply with age verification requirements \nwhile also safeguarding privacy and promoting \naccessibility for all users. \n\n \n22 \nRESPECTFULLY SUBMITTED \nJAMES R.

          "task_beliefs": "My understanding of the case is now centered on a techno-factual debate that will likely determine the outcome. The legal frameworks are established, but their application hinges on the Court's assessment of modern age-verification technology.\n\n1.  **Central Legal Conflict (Solidified):** The core tension remains between *Sable-Ashcroft II* (protecting adult access) and *Ginsberg* (allowing regulation of material harmful to minors). The Yoti amicus brief has provided a powerful factual predicate for the \"changed circumstances\" argument, giving the Court a clear path to distinguish *Ashcroft II* without overruling it. The key question from *Ashcroft II*\u2014whether less restrictive technological alternatives exist\u2014has now been directly and robustly answered by a subject-matter expert, shifting the burden of proof to the petitioners to demonstrate that these new technologies are inadequate or still too restrictive.\n\n2.  **Respondent's Argumentative Structure (Strengthened and Clarified):** Texas's multi-layered strategy is not only confirmed but its fallback position has become significantly more viable, potentially offering the Court the most attractive path to a decision.\n    *   **Primary Argument (Rational Basis):** This remains Texas's lead argument. The credibility of the new technology might indirectly bolster this position; if the burden on speech is perceived as technologically trivial and privacy-preserving, some justices may be more inclined to view the law as a reasonable time, place, and manner regulation deserving of a lower standard of review.\n    *   **Fallback Position (Strict Scrutiny):** This is now a highly credible, evidence-backed argument. The Yoti brief provides the specific facts needed to argue that AI-driven age *estimation* is the \"least restrictive means\" because it is effective, fast, and privacy-preserving (deleting images immediately). This gives the Court a jurisprudentially conservative \"off-ramp\" to uphold the law by distinguishing precedent on its facts rather than overturning it.\n    *   **Radical Alternative (Overrule *Ashcroft II*):** This remains a low-probability outcome, made even less likely by the strength of the new factual evidence that allows for a less disruptive ruling.\n\n3.  **Prediction & Key Variable (Updated):** My assessment of the case outcome has shifted. The probability of the Court upholding the Texas law has increased. The central pivot of the case is no longer a purely legal contest of precedents but has become a factual determination: **Is modern age-verification technology as effective, non-burdensome, and privacy-preserving as the Yoti brief claims?** The credibility of Yoti as a global industry leader with NIST-benchmarked technology makes their claims highly persuasive. The outcome now likely hinges on the petitioners' ability to effectively rebut these specific technological assertions.\n\n4.  **Current Analytical Focus (Sharpened):** My primary uncertainty is now the strength and nature of the counter-argument to the technological claims. My previous plan to analyze amicus briefs has been validated and now has a more specific target. The next essential action is to locate and analyze amicus briefs filed in support of the *petitioners* (Free Speech Coalition, Inc.), specifically looking for countervailing expert opinions from technologists, privacy organizations, or academics that challenge the factual assertions made by Yoti. This will reveal the other side of the crucial factual debate and balance my model.\n\n5.  **Key Factual Record (Stable & Central):** The specific technologies and standards identified in the Yoti brief (AI Facial Age Estimation, reusable tokens, NIST benchmarks, European regulatory approvals) are no longer just new facts but have become the central factual battleground of the case.\n\n6.  **Procedural Timeline (Stable):** The petitioner's reply brief is due on or before December 23, 2024, with oral arguments on January 15, 2025. This timeline remains unchanged.",
          "design_beliefs": "My strategic framework has been powerfully validated and refined by the process of proactively seeking and analyzing expert-driven amicus briefs. The value of moving beyond the parties' own arguments to the broader intellectual ecosystem of a case is now a core tenet of my methodology.\n\n1.  **Leverage Internal Structure:** Remains a valid first-pass analysis tool.\n2.  **Identify Argumentative Patterns:** Remains a key heuristic.\n3.  **Map Competing Precedents:** The *Sable-Ashcroft* vs. *Ginsberg* model, combined with the search for \"changed circumstances,\" proved to be the correct predictive framework.\n4.  **Deconstruct Argumentative Hierarchies:** Crucial for understanding that new evidence can disproportionately strengthen a party's *fallback* position, making their overall strategy more resilient.\n5.  **Analyze Framing as a Core Strategy:** The Yoti brief's framing as a direct answer to a question left open by a prior Supreme Court ruling (*Ashcroft II*) is a powerful persuasive technique to watch for.\n6.  **Interpret Procedural Filings as Structural Data:** Remains a valuable principle.\n7.  **Adopt a Dialectical Approach (Powerfully Confirmed):** The subroutine of **proactive uncertainty reduction during procedural delays** is a highly effective strategy. By analyzing amicus briefs before the petitioner's reply, I was able to anticipate a core component of the respondent's case and sharpen my model of the central conflict. This transforms passive waiting time into an active information-gathering phase.\n8.  **Employ a \"Consolidate, Plan, and Target Uncertainty\" Meta-Heuristic (Refined):** The \"Consolidate and Plan\" heuristic is now refined. The process is: 1) Consolidate current knowledge. 2) Identify the point of maximum uncertainty that, if resolved, would most significantly update the prediction model. 3) Plan the next action to directly target that uncertainty. In this case, the uncertainty shifted from \"What is Texas's best argument?\" to \"What is the rebuttal to Yoti's technical claims?\"\n9.  **Analyze Amicus Briefs as a Strategic Tool (Validated & Refined):** This principle is confirmed. Amicus briefs are not just supplementary; they can provide the dispositive factual record needed to satisfy a legal test (e.g., the \"least restrictive means\" prong of strict scrutiny).\n10. **Prioritize Amicus Briefs from Subject-Matter Experts (Elevated to Core Principle):** This principle is now central. Amicus briefs from credible, non-ideological subject-matter experts can be more influential than those from traditional advocacy groups. They provide factual authority that can fundamentally alter the Court's application of legal doctrine. These briefs should be actively sought out and prioritized in any case involving technical, scientific, or specialized knowledge."

          "task_beliefs": "My model of this case continues to refine, with the latest observation\u2014or lack thereof\u2014significantly weighting the scales. The central conflict is no longer just a legal debate but a techno-factual one where one side's evidence currently stands unchallenged.\n\n1.  **Central Legal Conflict (Stable):** The tension between *Sable-Ashcroft II* (protecting adult access) and *Ginsberg* (protecting minors) remains the core legal framework. The \"changed circumstances\" argument, predicated on new technology, is the key to resolving this tension.\n\n2.  **Respondent's Argumentative Structure (Significantly Strengthened):** The failure to find a countervailing technical amicus brief for the petitioners makes the respondent's (Texas's) position, particularly its fallback argument, substantially more compelling.\n    *   **Primary Argument (Rational Basis):** This argument remains Texas's lead, and its plausibility may be indirectly enhanced if the Court perceives the technological burden on speech as minimal.\n    *   **Fallback Position (Strict Scrutiny):** This position is now on very firm ground. The Yoti brief provided the specific factual evidence that modern age verification is the \"least restrictive means.\" The *absence* of a competing amicus brief from a technology expert challenging Yoti's claims is a powerful signal. It suggests that there may be no strong, credible expert opinion to the contrary, leaving Yoti's detailed assertions on AI age estimation, privacy-preserving tokens, and NIST benchmarks as the primary, and currently unrebutted, expert evidence before the Court.\n    *   **Radical Alternative (Overrule *Ashcroft II*):** This remains a very low-probability outcome. The strength of the unchallenged factual record makes it even easier for the Court to distinguish, rather than overrule, precedent.\n\n3.  **Prediction & Key Variable (Confidence Increased):** My prediction that the Court will uphold the Texas law has strengthened. The key variable\u2014**Is modern age-verification technology as effective, non-burdensome, and privacy-preserving as the Yoti brief claims?**\u2014is now leaning heavily toward \"yes\" in the evidentiary record. The lack of a formal rebuttal from a peer organization during the amicus phase significantly lowers the probability that the petitioners can effectively undermine Yoti's credibility. The burden on the petitioners in their upcoming reply brief is now immense; they must not only argue the law but also introduce and validate a technical counter-narrative without the backing of an expert amicus.\n\n4.  **Current Analytical Focus (Pivoted):** My previous goal was to find and analyze the petitioners' technical support. The result of that search was a null signal. My focus now pivots entirely to the **petitioner's reply brief**, due December 23, 2024. This document is now the last and best opportunity for the petitioners to introduce evidence or arguments to rebut the Yoti brief's technical claims. The key question is no longer *what* the counter-argument is, but *if* one will be presented at all, and how persuasive it can be without the imprimatur of a dedicated technical amicus.\n\n5.  **Key Factual Record (Solidified and One-Sided):** The technical details from the Yoti brief (AI Facial Age Estimation, reusable tokens, NIST benchmarks, liveness detection, European regulatory acceptance) are not just the central battleground; they are currently the only army on the field. Until and unless the petitioners' reply brief provides a substantive technical challenge, this one-sided factual record is what the Court has to work with.\n\n6.  **Procedural Timeline (Stable but with Increased Stakes):** The timeline is unchanged, but the significance of the December 23 reply brief deadline has magnified. It represents the petitioners' critical moment to counter a factual narrative that has gone unanswered through the entire amicus phase.",
          "design_beliefs": "This last observation has been profoundly instructive, not for what it contained, but for what it lacked. It has validated my core strategies while adding a crucial new layer regarding the interpretation of negative information and system limitations.\n\n1.  **Leverage Internal Structure:** Remains a valid first-pass analysis tool.\n2.  **Identify Argumentative Patterns:** Remains a key heuristic.\n3.  **Map Competing Precedents:** The *Sable-Ashcroft* vs. *Ginsberg* model with a \"changed circumstances\" variable remains the correct framework.\n4.  **Deconstruct Argumentative Hierarchies:** Confirmed. The lack of a rebuttal to the respondent's evidence disproportionately strengthens their fallback position, making their entire case more robust.\n5.  **Analyze Framing as a Core Strategy:** The Yoti brief's framing as a direct answer to *Ashcroft II* remains a powerful persuasive device, made more so by the silence from the other side.\n6.  **Interpret Procedural Filings as Structural Data:** Remains valuable.\n7.  **Adopt a Dialectical Approach (Powerfully Confirmed):** The strategy of seeking the \"antithesis\" (a rebuttal to Yoti) was correct. The result\u2014a \"null signal\"\u2014is itself a crucial part of the synthesis, informing the current state of the argument. The dialectic progresses even in the absence of direct opposition.\n8.  **Employ a \"Consolidate, Plan, and Target Uncertainty\" Meta-Heuristic (Validated):** This process worked perfectly. I identified the key uncertainty (the technical rebuttal) and targeted it. The result eliminated one potential source for that information (amicus briefs) and sharpened my focus onto the next (the petitioner's reply brief).\n9.  **Analyze Amicus Briefs as a Strategic Tool (Refined):** The *absence* of an amicus brief from an expected source (e.g., a tech expert for the petitioners) is an evidentiary signal in its own right. It can suggest a lack of expert support for a particular position, which can be as influential as a brief itself.\n10. **Prioritize Amicus Briefs from Subject-Matter Experts (Validated):** This principle is strongly confirmed. My entire analytical focus has been shaped by the presence of one expert brief and the conspicuous absence of another.\n11. **Interpret Negative Search Results as Evidence (New Principle):** When a targeted search for a specific, anticipated document (a technical amicus brief for petitioners) by its filing deadline yields no results, this \"negative result\" should be treated as a positive piece of evidence. It suggests the document does not exist, which strengthens the opposing side's arguments by leaving their claims unrebutted from that particular type of source.\n12. **Acknowledge Tool Limitations (New Principle):** The search tool performed a keyword match, not a semantic one, returning documents *related* to the Yoti brief when I searched for briefs supporting the petitioners. This highlights the need to critically evaluate search results and understand the limitations of the tools being used, and to verify the \"intent\" of a document (e.g., \"in support of respondent\") beyond its keyword content."

Literature 236 (1973) ......................... 18\n\n \n \nINTRODUCTION \nAmericans hold a wide range of views about sexual \ncontent online.  Some view it as offensive or indecent; \nfor others, it is artistic, informative, or even essential to \nimportant parts of career and life.  Consistent with the \nbedrock First Amendment principle that \u201cesthetic and \nmoral judgments about art and literature \u2026 are for the \nindividual to make, not for the Government to decree,\u201d \nthis Court has long treated non-obscene sexual content \nas constitutionally protected for adults.  United States \nv. Playboy Ent. Grp., Inc., 529 U.S. 803, 818 (2000).  And \nwhile the Court has held that states may limit minors\u2019 \naccess to sexual material reasonably found harmful to \nthem, Ginsberg v. New York, 390 U.S. 629, 638-39 (1968), \nthe Court has uniformly held that a content-based \nburden on adults\u2019 access to such protected speech \u201ccan \nstand only if it satisfies strict scrutiny,\u201d Playboy, 529 \nU.S. at 813; see Ashcroft v. ACLU, 542 U.S. 656, 665-66 \n(2004); Reno v. ACLU, 521 U.S. 844, 874 (1997); Sable \nCommc\u2019ns v. FCC, 492 U.S. 115, 126 (1989). \nEnacted in 2023, Texas House Bill (H.B.) 1181 \nimposes requirements on commercial websites \u201cmore \nthan one-third of which\u201d are \u201csexual material harmful \nto minors\u201d\u2014a term that includes all sexually suggestive \ncontent, as might be found in romance novels or R-rated \nmovies.  Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code \u00a7 129B.002(a).  The \nlaw requires a covered website to verify the age of every \nuser, typically via government-issued identification.  Id.  \n\u00a7\u00a7 129B.002-003.  Entities conducting such verification \nmay not \u201cretain\u201d users\u2019 \u201cidentifying information,\u201d id. \n\u00a7 129B.002(b), but H.B. 1181 does not prohibit transfer \nof that information or impose any other protection \nagainst disclosure.  And while Texas insists that forcing \nusers to endure chilling online privacy and security \n\n2 \n \n \nrisks is necessary to protect minors from harmful \nsexual content, H.B. 1181 exempts the search engines \nand social-media platforms that are principal gateways \nfor minors\u2019 access to that very content.  Id. \u00a7 129B.005. \nConfirming Texas\u2019s real aims, H.B. 1181 also requires \ncovered websites to post stigmatizing, unscientific \n\u201c[w]arnings\u201d that condemn their content as harmful to \nhealth.  Id. \u00a7 129B.004. \nThe district court preliminarily enjoined H.B. 1181, \nfinding that the law is subject to strict scrutiny and \nlikely to fail it under this Court\u2019s governing precedent.  \nIn particular, the court explained that H.B. 1181\u2019s age-\nverification requirement is materially identical to the \nChild Online Protection Act (COPA), 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 231, \nwhich this Court in Ashcroft held was subject to strict \nscrutiny and likely unconstitutional.  The Fifth Circuit \nagreed that H.B. 1181 is materially identical to COPA, \nbut a divided panel held that it was not bound by \nAshcroft because that decision contains what the \nmajority termed \u201cstartling omissions.\u201d  Pet. App. \n17a.  The majority concluded that the proper level of \nscrutiny is instead rational-basis review, as applied in \nGinsberg.  To justify its departure from Ashcroft, the \nmajority reasoned that this Court there applied strict \nscrutiny to COPA only because Attorney General \nAshcroft, represented by Solicitor General Olson, \nerroneously accepted strict scrutiny rather than urging \nmere rational-basis review in defense of the statute.   \nAs recognized by Judge Higginbotham\u2019s dissent, the \nFifth Circuit veered astray.  This Court in Ashcroft did \nnot apply strict scrutiny to COPA based on an oversight \nor concession.  It did so because First Amendment \nprinciples and precedent firmly establish that strict \nscrutiny \napplies \nto \ncontent-based \nburdens \non \n\n3 \n \n \nconstitutionally protected speech, specifically including \nsexual content that is not obscene for adults.  Neither \nTexas\u2019s professed aim to protect minors nor Ginsberg\u2019s \nholding\u2014which applies only to the rights of minors\u2014\nalters that analysis.  The laws in Ashcroft, Reno, \nPlayboy, and Sable all aimed to protect minors, and this \nCourt applied strict scrutiny in each of those post-\nGinsberg decisions.  Strict scrutiny applies here too. \nUnder strict scrutiny, this is a straightforward \ncase.  As the district court found and the Fifth Circuit \ndid not question, H.B. 1181 is both overinclusive and \nunderinclusive, and it fails to pursue its objective with \nthe means least restrictive of adults\u2019 protected speech.  \nIndeed, Texas has disregarded the measure specifically \nidentified in Ashcroft as both less restrictive and more \neffective than online age-verification: content-filtering \nsoftware, which limits minors\u2019 access to sexual material \ninappropriate for them without burdening adults\u2019 \naccess to speech they have a right to receive.  That \nlegislative oversight is especially striking because \ncontent-filtering \ntechnology \nhas \nimproved \nsince \nAshcroft.  Meanwhile, online age-verification has grown \neasier to circumvent and threats of online identity theft, \nextortion, and data breaches have multiplied\u2014\nheightening chills in the highly sensitive and personal \ncontext of accessing sexual material. \nRestoring the preliminary injunction of H.B. 1181 by \nreversing the erroneous decision below would not \nundermine genuine efforts to limit minors\u2019 access to \nsexually inappropriate material.  Petitioners agree that \nprotecting minors is a compelling government interest \nand that\u2014as this Court expressly stated in Ashcroft\u2014a \nlaw narrowly tailored to that objective can survive strict \nscrutiny.  542 U.S. at 672-73.  The Fifth Circuit\u2019s \n\n4 \n \n \napplication of rational-basis review is therefore as \nunnecessary as it is wrong.  As in other recent cases, the \nCourt should adhere to \u201csettled principles about \nfreedom of expression\u201d that have \u201cserved the Nation \nwell over many years\u201d and reject the Fifth Circuit\u2019s \njarring departure from First Amendment precedent.  \nMoody v. NetChoice, LLC, 144 S. Ct. 2383, 2403 (2024).   \nOPINIONS BELOW \nThe Fifth Circuit\u2019s opinion (Pet. App. 1a-87a) is \nreported at 95 F.4th 263.  The opinion of the district \ncourt granting a preliminary injunction (Pet. App. 90a-\n161a) is reported at 689 F. Supp. 3d 373. \nJURISDICTION \nThe Fifth Circuit entered its judgment on March 7, \n2024.  Petitioners timely petitioned for certiorari on \nApril 12, 2024.  This Court has jurisdiction under 28 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 1254(1). \nCONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY \nPROVISIONS INVOLVED \nThe First Amendment to the United States \nConstitution provides in relevant part that \u201cCongress \nshall make no law \u2026 abridging the freedom of speech.\u201d  \nH.B. 1181 is reproduced in an appendix to this brief. \nSTATEMENT \nA. Legal And Factual Background \n1.  \u201cThe most basic\u201d principle of free speech is that \n\u201cgovernment has no power to restrict expression \nbecause of its message, its ideas, its subject matter, or \nits content.\u201d  Brown v. Ent. Merchs. Ass\u2019n, 564 U.S. 786, \n790-91 (2011) (citation omitted).  Generally, when a law \n\u201cimposes a restriction on the content of protected \n\n5 \n \n \nspeech, it is invalid unless \u2026 it passes strict scrutiny\u2014\nthat is, unless it is justified by a compelling government \ninterest and is narrowly drawn to serve that interest.\u201d  \nId. at 799.  Otherwise, content-based speech restrictions \nare permitted only in limited \u201chistoric and traditional \ncategories long familiar to the bar.\u201d  United States v. \nStevens, 559 U.S. 460, 468 (2010) (citation omitted).   \nOne such category is obscenity, defined as material \nthat \n\u201cdepicts \nor \ndescribes \n\u2026 \nsexual \ncontent\u201d \n(specifically identified by statute), in a \u201cpatently \noffensive\u201d way that \u201cappeals to the prurient interest,\u201d \nand, taken as a whole, \u201clacks serious literary, artistic, \npolitical, or scientific value.\u201d  Miller v. California, 413 \nU.S. 15, 24 (1973) (citation omitted).  In Ginsberg, the \nCourt upheld a state law that \u201cadjusts the definition of \nobscenity\u201d applicable to minors based on their different \nreaction to sexual content.  Id. at 638 (citation omitted).  \nAs to adults, however, the Court has \u201cmade it perfectly \nclear that \u2018sexual expression which is \u2026 not obscene is \nprotected by the First Amendment.\u2019\u201d  Reno, 521 U.S. at \n874 (brackets and citation omitted).  And the Court has \nrepeatedly held that laws imposing content-based \nburdens on adults\u2019 access to such constitutionally \nprotected expression are subject to strict scrutiny, even \nif the laws permissibly aim to restrict minors\u2019 access to \nsuch material.  Id.; see Ashcroft, 542 U.S. at 665-66; \nPlayboy, 529 U.S. at 813; Sable, 492 U.S. at 126. \nThe Court\u2019s most recent decision in that line of cases \nis Ashcroft.  There, the Court considered a challenge to \nCOPA, \nwhich \nprohibited\u2014absent \nage-verification \nmeasures\u2014the online transmission of content that \nCongress deemed obscene for minors using a modified \nobscenity standard like the one at issue in Ginsberg.  \n542 U.S. at 661-62.  Because COPA burdened adults\u2019 \n\n6 \n \n \naccess to speech constitutionally protected for them, the \nCourt held that strict scrutiny applied for the same \nreasons as in analogous prior cases.  Id. at 665-66 (citing \nReno, 521 U.S. at 874); see id. at 670 (citing Playboy, \n529 U.S. at 825-26).  The Court then upheld a \npreliminary injunction of COPA, determining that the \nstatute was likely unconstitutional because \u201cless \nrestrictive \nalternatives\u201d\u2014in \nparticular, \ncontent-\nfiltering software\u2014\u201cwould be at least as effective in \nachieving the legitimate purpose that the statute was \nenacted to serve.\u201d  Id. at 665 (quoting Reno, 521 U.S. at \n874); see id. at 665-66, 673. \n2.  Almost 20 years after Ashcroft, in June 2023, \nTexas enacted H.B. 1181.  H.B. 1181 requires age \nverification by any commercial website \u201cmore than one-\nthird of which is sexual material harmful to minors,\u201d \nTex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code \u00a7 129B.002(a), defined \nusing almost exactly the same modification of the adult \nobscenity standard that Congress adopted in COPA, id. \n\u00a7 129B.001(6).1  Because this statutory definition \napplies to even the youngest minors, for whom almost \n \n1  \nSpecifically, H.B. 1181 defines \u201c[s]exual material harmful \nto minors\u201d as including material that \u201c(A) the average person \napplying contemporary community standards would find, taking \nthe material as a whole and with respect to minors, is designed to \nappeal to or pander to the prurient interest; (B) in a manner \npatently offensive with respect to minors, exploits, is devoted to, \nor principally consists of descriptions of actual, simulated, or \nanimated displays or depictions of: (i) a person\u2019s pubic hair, anus, \nor genitals or the nipple of the female breast; (ii) touching, \ncaressing, or fondling of nipples, breasts, buttocks, anuses, or \ngenitals; or (iii) sexual intercourse, masturbation, sodomy, \nbestiality, oral copulation, flagellation, excretory functions, \nexhibitions, or any other sexual act; and (C) taken as a whole, lacks \nserious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value for minors.\u201d \nTex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code \u00a7 129B.001(6). \n\n7 \n \n \nany sexual content could qualify as obscene, H.B. 1181 \ncovers \u201call salacious material,\u201d from sex-education \ncontent to simulated sex scenes in Oscar-winning films.  \nPet. App. 109a, 115a.  And because H.B. 1181 applies to \nany website that devotes any more than one-third of its \ncontent to such sexual material, its restrictions apply to \nbroad swaths of speech that are not sexual\u2014much less \nobscene, even as to minors.  \nH.B. 1181 also contains several conspicuous \nexemptions.  It expressly exempts search engines, Tex. \nCiv. Prac. & Rem. Code \u00a7 129B.005(b), even though they \ncan provide access to the same sexual content as \ncovered websites, see Pet. App. 112a.  And the law de \nfacto exempts social-media sites that contain less than \none-third sexual material, even if those sites contain a \nlarger total volume of sexual content (including the \nsame content) as covered websites.  Pet. App. 113a. \nTo comply with \nH.B. 1181\u2019s age-verification \nrequirement, covered websites must \u201cverify that an \nindividual attempting to access the [site] is\u201d at least 18 \nyears old using \u201cdigital identification,\u201d \u201cgovernment-\nissued identification,\u201d or \u201ca commercially reasonable \nmethod that relies on public or private transactional \ndata.\u201d  Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code \u00a7\u00a7 129B.002(a), \n129B.003.  An entity conducting age verification \u201cmay \nnot retain any identifying information of the individual,\u201d \nid. \u00a7 129B.002(b), but H.B. 1181 imposes no limits on \ntransmitting that information to others.  Nor does H.B. \n1181 establish any data-security requirements or \ndisclosure prohibitions for entities conducting age \nverification or others that receive identification \ninformation as part of the verification process. \nH.B. 1181 also mandates that covered websites post \nscripted \u201csexual materials health warnings\u201d on the \n\n8 \n \n \n\u201clanding page\u201d of the website and \u201call advertisements,\u201d \nalong with \u201chelpline\u201d numbers for \u201csubstance abuse and \nmental health.\u201d  Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code \n\u00a7 129B.004 (capitalization altered).  The purported \nwarnings state that \u201c[p]ornography is potentially \nbiologically addictive\u201d and \u201cproven to harm human \nbrain development.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 129B.004(1); see id. \n(\u201cExposure to this content is associated with low self-\nesteem and body image, eating disorders, impaired \nbrain development, and other emotional and mental \nillnesses.\u201d).  The statements are attributed to \u201cTEXAS \nHEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES,\u201d id., even \nthough that agency has not issued any such findings, \nPet. App. 95a.   \nNoncomplia\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

Some view it as offensive or indecent; \nfor others, it is artistic, informative, or even essential to \nimportant parts of career and life.  Consistent with the \nbedrock First Amendment principle that \u201cesthetic and \nmoral judgments about art and literature \u2026 are for the \nindividual to make, not for the Government to decree,\u201d \nthis Court has long treated non-obscene sexual content \nas constitutionally protected for adults.  United States \nv. Playboy Ent. Grp., Inc., 529 U.S. 803, 818 (2000).  And \nwhile the Court has held that states may limit minors\u2019 \naccess to sexual material reasonably found harmful to \nthem, Ginsberg v. New York, 390 U.S. 629, 638-39 (1968), \nthe Court has uniformly held that a content-based \nburden on adults\u2019 access to such protected speech \u201ccan \nstand only if it satisfies strict scrutiny,\u201d Playboy, 529 \nU.S. at 813; see Ashcroft v. ACLU, 542 U.S. 656, 665-66 \n(2004); Reno v. ACLU, 521 U.S. 844, 874 (1997); Sable \nCommc\u2019ns v. FCC, 492 U.S. 115, 126 (1989). \nEnacted in 2023, Texas House Bill (H.B.) 1181 \nimposes requirements on commercial websites \u201cmore \nthan one-third of which\u201d are \u201csexual material harmful \nto minors\u201d\u2014a term that includes all sexually suggestive \ncontent, as might be found in romance novels or R-rated \nmovies.  Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code \u00a7 129B.002(a).  The \nlaw requires a covered website to verify the age of every \nuser, typically via government-issued identification.  Id.  \n\u00a7\u00a7 129B.002-003.  Entities conducting such verification \nmay not \u201cretain\u201d users\u2019 \u201cidentifying information,\u201d id. \n\u00a7 129B.002(b), but H.B. 1181 does not prohibit transfer \nof that information or impose any other protection \nagainst disclosure.  And while Texas insists that forcing \nusers to endure chilling online privacy and security \n\n2 \n \n \nrisks is necessary to protect minors from harmful \nsexual content, H.B. 1181 exempts the search engines \nand social-media platforms that are principal gateways \nfor minors\u2019 access to that very content.  Id. \u00a7 129B.005. \nConfirming Texas\u2019s real aims, H.B. 1181 also requires \ncovered websites to post stigmatizing, unscientific \n\u201c[w]arnings\u201d that condemn their content as harmful to \nhealth.  Id. \u00a7 129B.004. \nThe district court preliminarily enjoined H.B. 1181, \nfinding that the law is subject to strict scrutiny and \nlikely to fail it under this Court\u2019s governing precedent.  \nIn particular, the court explained that H.B. 1181\u2019s age-\nverification requirement is materially identical to the \nChild Online Protection Act (COPA), 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 231, \nwhich this Court in Ashcroft held was subject to strict \nscrutiny and likely unconstitutional.  The Fifth Circuit \nagreed that H.B. 1181 is materially identical to COPA, \nbut a divided panel held that it was not bound by \nAshcroft because that decision contains what the \nmajority termed \u201cstartling omissions.\u201d  Pet. App. \n17a.  The majority concluded that the proper level of \nscrutiny is instead rational-basis review, as applied in \nGinsberg.  To justify its departure from Ashcroft, the \nmajority reasoned that this Court there applied strict \nscrutiny to COPA only because Attorney General \nAshcroft, represented by Solicitor General Olson, \nerroneously accepted strict scrutiny rather than urging \nmere rational-basis review in defense of the statute.   \nAs recognized by Judge Higginbotham\u2019s dissent, the \nFifth Circuit veered astray.  This Court in Ashcroft did \nnot apply strict scrutiny to COPA based on an oversight \nor concession.  It did so because First Amendment \nprinciples and precedent firmly establish that strict \nscrutiny \napplies \nto \ncontent-based \nburdens \non \n\n3 \n \n \nconstitutionally protected speech, specifically including \nsexual content that is not obscene for adults.  Neither \nTexas\u2019s professed aim to protect minors nor Ginsberg\u2019s \nholding\u2014which applies only to the rights of minors\u2014\nalters that analysis.  The laws in Ashcroft, Reno, \nPlayboy, and Sable all aimed to protect minors, and this \nCourt applied strict scrutiny in each of those post-\nGinsberg decisions.  Strict scrutiny applies here too. \nUnder strict scrutiny, this is a straightforward \ncase.  As the district court found and the Fifth Circuit \ndid not question, H.B. 1181 is both overinclusive and \nunderinclusive, and it fails to pursue its objective with \nthe means least restrictive of adults\u2019 protected speech.  \nIndeed, Texas has disregarded the measure specifically \nidentified in Ashcroft as both less restrictive and more \neffective than online age-verification: content-filtering \nsoftware, which limits minors\u2019 access to sexual material \ninappropriate for them without burdening adults\u2019 \naccess to speech they have a right to receive.  That \nlegislative oversight is especially striking because \ncontent-filtering \ntechnology \nhas \nimproved \nsince \nAshcroft.  Meanwhile, online age-verification has grown \neasier to circumvent and threats of online identity theft, \nextortion, and data breaches have multiplied\u2014\nheightening chills in the highly sensitive and personal \ncontext of accessing sexual material. \nRestoring the preliminary injunction of H.B. 1181 by \nreversing the erroneous decision below would not \nundermine genuine efforts to limit minors\u2019 access to \nsexually inappropriate material.  Petitioners agree that \nprotecting minors is a compelling government interest \nand that\u2014as this Court expressly stated in Ashcroft\u2014a \nlaw narrowly tailored to that objective can survive strict \nscrutiny.  542 U.S. at 672-73.  The Fifth Circuit\u2019s \n\n4 \n \n \napplication of rational-basis review is therefore as \nunnecessary as it is wrong.  As in other recent cases, the \nCourt should adhere to \u201csettled principles about \nfreedom of expression\u201d that have \u201cserved the Nation \nwell over many years\u201d and reject the Fifth Circuit\u2019s \njarring departure from First Amendment precedent.  \nMoody v. NetChoice, LLC, 144 S. Ct. 2383, 2403 (2024).   \nOPINIONS BELOW \nThe Fifth Circuit\u2019s opinion (Pet. App. 1a-87a) is \nreported at 95 F.4th 263.  The opinion of the district \ncourt granting a preliminary injunction (Pet. App. 90a-\n161a) is reported at 689 F. Supp. 3d 373. \nJURISDICTION \nThe Fifth Circuit entered its judgment on March 7, \n2024.  Petitioners timely petitioned for certiorari on \nApril 12, 2024.  This Court has jurisdiction under 28 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 1254(1). \nCONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY \nPROVISIONS INVOLVED \nThe First Amendment to the United States \nConstitution provides in relevant part that \u201cCongress \nshall make no law \u2026 abridging the freedom of speech.\u201d  \nH.B. 1181 is reproduced in an appendix to this brief. \nSTATEMENT \nA. Legal And Factual Background \n1.  \u201cThe most basic\u201d principle of free speech is that \n\u201cgovernment has no power to restrict expression \nbecause of its message, its ideas, its subject matter, or \nits content.\u201d  Brown v. Ent. Merchs. Ass\u2019n, 564 U.S. 786, \n790-91 (2011) (citation omitted).  Generally, when a law \n\u201cimposes a restriction on the content of protected \n\n5 \n \n \nspeech, it is invalid unless \u2026 it passes strict scrutiny\u2014\nthat is, unless it is justified by a compelling government \ninterest and is narrowly drawn to serve that interest.\u201d  \nId. at 799.  Otherwise, content-based speech restrictions \nare permitted only in limited \u201chistoric and traditional \ncategories long familiar to the bar.\u201d  United States v. \nStevens, 559 U.S. 460, 468 (2010) (citation omitted).   \nOne such category is obscenity, defined as material \nthat \n\u201cdepicts \nor \ndescribes \n\u2026 \nsexual \ncontent\u201d \n(specifically identified by statute), in a \u201cpatently \noffensive\u201d way that \u201cappeals to the prurient interest,\u201d \nand, taken as a whole, \u201clacks serious literary, artistic, \npolitical, or scientific value.\u201d  Miller v. California, 413 \nU.S. 15, 24 (1973) (citation omitted).  In Ginsberg, the \nCourt upheld a state law that \u201cadjusts the definition of \nobscenity\u201d applicable to minors based on their different \nreaction to sexual content.  Id. at 638 (citation omitted).  \nAs to adults, however, the Court has \u201cmade it perfectly \nclear that \u2018sexual expression which is \u2026 not obscene is \nprotected by the First Amendment.\u2019\u201d  Reno, 521 U.S. at \n874 (brackets and citation omitted).  And the Court has \nrepeatedly held that laws imposing content-based \nburdens on adults\u2019 access to such constitutionally \nprotected expression are subject to strict scrutiny, even \nif the laws permissibly aim to restrict minors\u2019 access to \nsuch material.  Id.; see Ashcroft, 542 U.S. at 665-66; \nPlayboy, 529 U.S. at 813; Sable, 492 U.S. at 126. \nThe Court\u2019s most recent decision in that line of cases \nis Ashcroft.  There, the Court considered a challenge to \nCOPA, \nwhich \nprohibited\u2014absent \nage-verification \nmeasures\u2014the online transmission of content that \nCongress deemed obscene for minors using a modified \nobscenity standard like the one at issue in Ginsberg.  \n542 U.S. at 661-62.  Because COPA burdened adults\u2019 \n\n6 \n \n \naccess to speech constitutionally protected for them, the \nCourt held that strict scrutiny applied for the same \nreasons as in analogous prior cases.  Id. at 665-66 (citing \nReno, 521 U.S. at 874); see id. at 670 (citing Playboy, \n529 U.S. at 825-26).  The Court then upheld a \npreliminary injunction of COPA, determining that the \nstatute was likely unconstitutional because \u201cless \nrestrictive \nalternatives\u201d\u2014in \nparticular, \ncontent-\nfiltering software\u2014\u201cwould be at least as effective in \nachieving the legitimate purpose that the statute was \nenacted to serve.\u201d  Id. at 665 (quoting Reno, 521 U.S. at \n874); see id. at 665-66, 673. \n2.  Almost 20 years after Ashcroft, in June 2023, \nTexas enacted H.B. 1181.  H.B. 1181 requires age \nverification by any commercial website \u201cmore than one-\nthird of which is sexual material harmful to minors,\u201d \nTex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code \u00a7 129B.002(a), defined \nusing almost exactly the same modification of the adult \nobscenity standard that Congress adopted in COPA, id. \n\u00a7 129B.001(6).1  Because this statutory definition \napplies to even the youngest minors, for whom almost \n \n1  \nSpecifically, H.B. 1181 defines \u201c[s]exual material harmful \nto minors\u201d as including material that \u201c(A) the average person \napplying contemporary community standards would find, taking \nthe material as a whole and with respect to minors, is designed to \nappeal to or pander to the prurient interest; (B) in a manner \npatently offensive with respect to minors, exploits, is devoted to, \nor principally consists of descriptions of actual, simulated, or \nanimated displays or depictions of: (i) a person\u2019s pubic hair, anus, \nor genitals or the nipple of the female breast; (ii) touching, \ncaressing, or fondling of nipples, breasts, buttocks, anuses, or \ngenitals; or (iii) sexual intercourse, masturbation, sodomy, \nbestiality, oral copulation, flagellation, excretory functions, \nexhibitions, or any other sexual act; and (C) taken as a whole, lacks \nserious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value for minors.\u201d \nTex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code \u00a7 129B.001(6). \n\n7 \n \n \nany sexual content could qualify as obscene, H.B. 1181 \ncovers \u201call salacious material,\u201d from sex-education \ncontent to simulated sex scenes in Oscar-winning films.  \nPet. App. 109a, 115a.  And because H.B. 1181 applies to \nany website that devotes any more than one-third of its \ncontent to such sexual material, its restrictions apply to \nbroad swaths of speech that are not sexual\u2014much less \nobscene, even as to minors.  \nH.B. 1181 also contains several conspicuous \nexemptions.  It expressly exempts search engines, Tex. \nCiv. Prac. & Rem. Code \u00a7 129B.005(b), even though they \ncan provide access to the same sexual content as \ncovered websites, see Pet. App. 112a.  And the law de \nfacto exempts social-media sites that contain less than \none-third sexual material, even if those sites contain a \nlarger total volume of sexual content (including the \nsame content) as covered websites.  Pet. App. 113a. \nTo comply with \nH.B. 1181\u2019s age-verification \nrequirement, covered websites must \u201cverify that an \nindividual attempting to access the [site] is\u201d at least 18 \nyears old using \u201cdigital identification,\u201d \u201cgovernment-\nissued identification,\u201d or \u201ca commercially reasonable \nmethod that relies on public or private transactional \ndata.\u201d  Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code \u00a7\u00a7 129B.002(a), \n129B.003.  An entity conducting age verification \u201cmay \nnot retain any identifying information of the individual,\u201d \nid. \u00a7 129B.002(b), but H.B. 1181 imposes no limits on \ntransmitting that information to others.  Nor does H.B. \n1181 establish any data-security requirements or \ndisclosure prohibitions for entities conducting age \nverification or others that receive identification \ninformation as part of the verification process. \nH.B. 1181 also mandates that covered websites post \nscripted \u201csexual materials health warnings\u201d on the \n\n8 \n \n \n\u201clanding page\u201d of the website and \u201call advertisements,\u201d \nalong with \u201chelpline\u201d numbers for \u201csubstance abuse and \nmental health.\u201d  Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code \n\u00a7 129B.004 (capitalization altered).  The purported \nwarnings state that \u201c[p]ornography is potentially \nbiologically addictive\u201d and \u201cproven to harm human \nbrain development.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 129B.004(1); see id. \n(\u201cExposure to this content is associated with low self-\nesteem and body image, eating disorders, impaired \nbrain development, and other emotional and mental \nillnesses.\u201d).  The statements are attributed to \u201cTEXAS \nHEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES,\u201d id., even \nthough that agency has not issued any such findings, \nPet. App. 95a.   \nNoncompliant websites are subject to enforcement \nactions by the Texas Attorney General and face \npenalties ranging from injunctive relief to fines of up to \n$10,000 per day, plus enhancements of up to $250,000.  \nTex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code \u00a7 129B.006. \n3.  Online age-verification mandated by H.B. 1181 \nposes severe risks to Internet users that do not arise \nduring in-person identification checks.  A \u201csubstantial \nchilling effect\u201d results from demanding proof of \nindividual identity online: Adults who submit, for \nexample, a \u201cgovernment ID\u201d over the Internet to \n\u201caffirmatively identify themselves\u201d understand that \nthey are thereby exposing themselves to \u201cinadvertent \ndisclosures, leaks, or hacks.\u201d  Pet. App. 125a-126a.  The \nchilling effect is worse than ever now because Internet \n\u201c[u]sers today are more cognizant of privacy concerns\u201d \nand \u201cdata breaches have become more high-profile\u201d and \ncommonplace.  Pet. App. 127a.  Adults\u2019 reasonable \nconcerns are compounded by H.B. 1181\u2019s failure to \nprohibit the transmission of adults\u2019 information to third \n\n9 \n \n \nparties\u2014including the government, creating the risk of \n\u201cstate monitoring\u201d of \u201cwhat kind of websites they visit.\u201d  \nPet. App. 125a-126a.  And H.B. 1181\u2019s deterrent effect \non adults\u2019 \u201caccess to sexual material\u201d is \u201cparticularly \nacute\u201d because it \u201ccan reveal intimate desires and \npreferences.\u201d  Pet. App. 125a.  Correspondingly, such \ninformation is \u201cmore likely to be targeted\u201d by identity \nthieves and extortionists because \u201cusers may be more \nwilling to pay to keep that information private.\u201d  Pet. \nApp. 127a. \nB. Procedural History \n1. District Court Proceedings \nPetitioners challenged H.B. 1181 soon after it was \nsigned.  Pet. App. 90a.  After an evidentiary hearing, the \ndistrict court issued an order preliminarily enjoining \nenforcement of H.B. 1181 before it became effective, \naccompanied by a lengthy decision explaining the \nfactual findings and legal reasoning underlying the \norder.  Pet. App. 90a-161a.  \na.  The district court held that petitioners are likely \nto succeed on the merits.  Under Reno and Ashcroft, the \ncourt explained, H.B. 1181 is subject to strict scrutiny \nbecause it is a content-based burden on adults\u2019 access to \nprotected speech.  Pet. App. 107a-111a.  While crediting \nTexas\u2019s compelling interest in protecting minors from \nharmful content, the court held that H.B. 1181\u2019s age-\nverification mandate likely does not withstand strict \nscrutiny because it is an underinclusive and overly \nrestrictive means of pursuing that interest, particularly \ngiven the availability of more effective, less restrictive \nalternatives.  Pet. App. 111a-136a.   \nThe district court first explained that H.B. 1181\u2019s \nexemptions of search engines and social media render it \n\n10 \n \n \n\u201cseverely underinclusive.\u201d  Pet. App. 112a-114a.  The \ncourt found that minors can easily locate \u201csexually \nexplicit or pornographic\u201d content on search engines \nthrough \u201cvisual search\u201d\u2014i.e., a search for images or \nvideos.  Pet. App. 112a.  The court also found that social-\nmedia platforms like Instagram and Facebook contain \n\u201cmaterial which is sexually explicit for minors,\u201d and \nsites like Reddit \u201cmaintain entire communities and \nforums\u201d devoted \u201cto posting online pornography.\u201d  Pet. \nApp. 113a.  Because such outlets are the most frequent \nsources for minors to access sexual content, yet none is \nregulated by H.B. 1181, the court found that the law \n\u201cfails to reduce the online pornography that is most \nreadily available to minors.\u201d  Pet. App. 113a.   \nThe district court similarly found that H.B. 1181\u2019s \nage-verification requirement is overly restrictive \nbecause it \u201csweeps far beyond obscene material and \nincludes all content offensive to minors, while failing to \nexempt material that has cultural, scientific, or \neducational value to adults only.\u201d  Pet. App. 122a.  The \ncourt added that the Texas legislature did not \u201ceven \nconsider[] the law\u2019s tailoring or ma[ke] any effort \nwhatsoever to choose the least-restrictive measure.\u201d  \nPet. App. 135a.  Indeed, the court found that Texas\u2019s \nown evidence\u2014along with petitioners\u2019\u2014identified less \nrestrictive and more effective alternatives.  In \nparticular, the legislature paid no heed to updated and \nimproved forms of the content-filtering software that \nthis Court found superior to online age-verification in \nAshcroft.  Pet. App. 128a-135a.  While Texas contended \nthat changes in technology should alter the judicial \nanalysis\u2014positing age verification as \u201cmore secure and \nconvenient\u201d and content filtering as obsolete\u2014the court \nfound that Texas\u2019s argument \u201csimply does not match \nthe evidence.\u201d  Pet. App. 127a.   \n\n11 \n \n \nb.  The district court also held that H.B. 1181\u2019s \nmandated health warnings are likely unconstitutionally \ncompelled speech.  Pet. App. 136a-150a.  Under \nNational Institute of Family and Life Advocates v. \nBecerra, 585 U.S. 755 (2018) (NIFLA), the court held \nthat the speech mandate is subject to strict scrutiny, \nwhich it likely cannot survive.  Pet. App. 137a-143a.  The \ncourt emphasized that, as a result of the age verification \nrequired by H.B. 1181, the warnings would be seen \npredominantly by adults, contrary to H.B. 1181\u2019s stated \npurpose of protecting minors.  Pet. App. 142a.  And even \nif the warnings are treated as a commercial-speech \nmandate subject to lesser scrutiny, the court held they \ncannot survive because they are not \u201cpurely factual and \nuncontroversial.\u201d  Pet. App. 145a (quoting Zauderer v. \nOff. of Disciplinary Couns., 471 U.S. 626, 651 (1985)). \nc.  Finally, the district court held that a preliminary \ninjunction is justified because H.B. 1181, if enforced, \nwill cause irreparable harm to petitioners and adult \nTexans by chilling access to protected sexual expression \nand compelling speech.  Pet. App. 156a.  In enjoining \nH.B. 1181, the court noted that \u201cnothing in th[e court\u2019s] \norder prevents the state from pursuing\u201d the other \n\u201cviable and constitutional means\u201d available \u201cto achieve \nTexas\u2019s goal\u201d of protecting minors.  Pet. App. 160a. \n2. Court Of Appeals Proceedings \na.  Texas appealed and sought a stay pending appeal \nfrom the Fifth Circuit.  See Pet. App. 167a-168a.  The \nmotions panel entered an administrative stay without \nany stated reasons, lasting nearly two months, during \nwhich time the parties briefed and argued the appeal.  \nPet. App. 167a-168a.  The merits panel then issued an \nunexplained stay pending appeal by a 2-1 vote, which \nlasted roughly another four months.  Pet. App. 166a & \n\n12 \n \n \nn.1 (noting Judge Higginbotham\u2019s dissenting vote).  \nDuring this period, Texas began enforcement actions.  \nSee C.A. Dkt. #131. \nb.  On March 7, 2024, the Fifth Circuit merits panel \nupheld the preliminary injunction unanimously as to the \nhealth-warning provision, Pet. App. 27a-38a, but held by \na 2-1 vote that petitioners were unlikely to succeed in \nchallenging the age-verification provision, Pet. App. 8a-\n27a.  The panel accordingly vacated the preliminary \ninjunction as to the age-verification provision over \nJudge Higginbotham\u2019s dissent.  Pet. App. 44a. \nThe panel majority acknowledged that H.B. 1181\u2019s \nage-verification requirement is \u201cvery similar\u201d to the \nCOPA provisions addressed by this Court in Ashcroft, \nrejecting Texas\u2019s purported distinctions of the two \nstatutes.  Pet. App. 16a.  Nevertheless, the majority \nheld that rational-basis review is the applicable \nstandard of scrutiny given Ginsberg.  Pet. App. 17a, 26a.  \nThe majority acknowledged that its holding departs \nfrom Ashcroft, but it declined to follow this Court\u2019s \ndecision in that case.  Pet. App. 16a-19a.  It deemed the \nAshcroft Court\u2019s lack of \u201cdiscussion of rational-basis \nreview under Ginsberg\u201d a \u201cstartling omission[]\u201d that \ncould \u201conly\u201d be explained by the failure of the United \nStates to argue for the application of rational-basis \nreview\u2014a non-jurisdictional error that the Court \npurportedly \u201cdid not have to correct\u201d on its own.  Pet. \nApp. 17a-18a.      \nThe panel majority similarly declined to apply other \nprecedents holding that strict scrutiny applies to \ncontent-based \nburdens \non \nadults\u2019 \naccess \nto \nconstitutionally protected sexual expression.  Pet. App. \n13a-16a, 20a-26a (discussing Reno, Playboy, and Sable).  \nThe majority contended that none of these cases could \n\n13 \n \n \n\u201csurmount the rock that is Ginsberg.\u201d  Pet. App. 20a.  \nThe majority then held that H.B. 1181\u2019s age-verification \nprovision \u201ceasily\u201d survives rational-basis review.  Pet. \nApp. 26a.   \nJudge Higginbotham dissented, relying on Sable, \nReno, Playboy, and Ashcroft.  Pet. App. 45a-87a.  H.B. \n1181 \u201cmust face strict scrutiny review,\u201d he explained, \n\u201cbecause it limits adults\u2019 access to protected speech \nusing a content-based distinction.\u201d  Pet. App. 47a-48a.  \nHe added that Ginsberg \u201chas no purchase\u201d in \naddressing \u201ca challenge to an adult\u2019s ability to access \nconstitutionally protected materials\u201d online, because \nGinsberg held \u201cthat minors have more limited First \nAmendment rights than adults.\u201d  Pet. App. 56a-57a.  \nFinding no clear error in the district court\u2019s findings, he \nwould have affirmed the preliminary injunction in full.  \nPet. App. 68a-78a.   \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nH.B. \n1181\u2019s \nage-verification \nrequirement \nis \nunconstitutional under a straightforward application of \nFirst Amendment principles and precedent.  The \npreliminary injunction should accordingly be restored. \nA.  When speech is protected by the First \nAmendment, a content-based burden on that speech \ntriggers strict scrutiny.  H.B. 1181\u2019s age-verification \nrequirement fits squarely within that rule.  The age-\nverification requirement is triggered by speech that \nTexas has deemed inappropriate for minors but that is \nconstitutionally protected for adults.  It is facially \ncontent-based, applying only to specified sexual \nmaterial.  And it imposes a clear burden, forcing adult \nusers to incur severe privacy and security risks\u2014which \n\n14 \n \n \nthe statute leaves largely unaddressed\u2014before they \ncan access constitutionally protected speech. \nBasic principles of free speech thus call for strict \nscrutiny.  And this Court\u2019s precedent removes all \ndoubt.  In an unbroken line of cases dating back \ndecades, the Court has uniformly applied strict scrutiny \nto laws that do what H.B. 1181 does\u2014burden adults\u2019 \naccess to non-obscene sexual content, which is \nconstitutionally protected for them, while attempting to \nrestrict minors\u2019 access to that content.  That line of \ncases culminated in Ashcroft, in which eight Justices \napplied \nstrict \nscrutiny \nto \na \nlaw \nmaterially \nindistinguishable from H.B. 1181. \nWithout attempting to distinguish Ashcroft, the \nFifth Circuit dismissed it by speculating that this Court \ndid not really mean that strict scrutiny applies to laws \nlike COPA and H.B. 1181.  That position is as \nremarkable as it is mistaken.  Lower federal courts \nmay not disregard this Court\u2019s decisions, even if they \n(mis)perceive \n\u201comissions\u201d \nin \nthe \nCourt\u2019s \nreasoning.  Pet. App. 17a.  Regardless, Ashcroft \nevidences no omission.  The Ashcroft Court subjected \nCOPA to strict scrutiny because that is what the First \nAmendment requires, as the United States recognized \nin defending the statute.  The Court did not adopt the \nrational-basis review standard of Ginsberg, because \nthat standard applies to the definition of obscenity for \nminors\u2014not the imposition of burdens on adults, as this \nCourt\u2019s post-Ginsberg decisions in Reno, Playboy, and \nSable confirm. \nB.  Under the proper standard of strict scrutiny, \nthis case is readily resolved.  As the district court found \nand the Fifth Circuit did not refute, H.B. 1181\u2019s age-\nverification requirement is triply flawed: it is \n\n15 \n \n \noverinclusive, underinclusive, and not the least \nrestrictive means of pursuing the state\u2019s interest in \nprotecting minors.  It is overinclusive because\u2014\nthrough its application to entire websites that have \nmore than one-third content inappropriate for minors\u2014\nit restricts adults\u2019 access to speech that is not even \nsexual and not even arguably obscene for minors.  It is \nunderinclusive because it exempts search engines and \nsocial-media sites that make available to minors huge \nquantities of the same content that the statute restricts \non petitioners\u2019 websites.  And it fails to adopt less \nrestrictive \nand \nmore \neffective \nalternatives \nto \nburdensome online age-verification, such as the \ncontent-filtering software that this Court identified in \nAshcroft.  Each of those defects is independently fatal; \ntogether, they underscore that H.B. 1181 is designed \nforemost to target disfavored speakers\u2014whom the law \nbrands with self-condemning \u201chealth warnings\u201d\u2014\nrather than to meet the state\u2019s purported objective.  \nSuch speaker-based discrimination affords yet another \nreason why petitioners\u2019 challenge will likely succeed. \nC.  Petitioners satisfy the remaining requirements \nfor a preliminary injunction.  They, along with Texas \nadults, are irreparably harmed by the loss of their First \nAmendment freedoms and the prospect of crippling \nenforcement \nproceedings \nand \nunrecoverable \ncompliance costs.  Moreover, the equities and public \ninterest strongly favor enjoining enforcement of the \nstatute until the litigation is complete\u2014just as was true \nfor the comparable laws in Reno and Ashcroft. \n\n16 \n \n \nARGUMENT \nTHE PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION OF THE AGE-\nVERIFICATION REQUIREMENT IN H.B. 1181 \nSHOULD BE RESTORED \nA \u201cplaintiff seeking a preliminary injunction must \nestablish that he is likely to succeed on the merits, that \nhe is likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of \npreliminary relief, that the balance of equities tips in his \nfavor, and that an injunction is in the public interest.\u201d  \nWinter v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 20 \n(2008).  Here, as in most First Amendment cases, the \nprincipal \nquestion \nis \nwhether \npetitioners \nhave \n\u201cdemonstrated that they are likely to succeed on the \nmerits.\u201d  Ashcroft, 542 U.S. at 666.  As the district court \ncorrectly concluded, they have.  Because petitioners \nalso satisfy the relevant equitable factors, the \npreliminary injunction should be restored.  See Pet. App. \n45a-87a (Higginbotham, J., dissenting). \nA. The Age-Verification Requirement In H.B. \n1181 Is Subject To Strict Scrutiny \n1. Strict Scrutiny Applies To Content-Based \nBurdens On Protected Speech  \na.  \u201cThe First Amendment, applicable to the States \nthrough the Fourteenth Amendment, prohibits laws \nthat abridge the freedom of speech.\u201d  NIFLA, 585 U.S. \nat 766. It is a \u201cfundamental principle\u201d of the First \nAmendment that states typically cannot restrict \nprotected speech \u201cbecause of its message, its ideas, its \nsubject matter, or its content.\u201d  NIFLA, 585 U.S. at 766 \n(quoting Police Dept. v. Mosley, 408 U.S. 92, 95 (1972)).  \nSuch restrictions \u201care presumptively unconstitutional\u201d \nand generally may be justified only if they overcome the \n\u201cstringent standard\u201d of strict scrutiny.  Id.  The Court \n\n17 \n \n \nhas applied that principle to speech of many different \nforms, from outdoor signs to violent video games to \ndepictions of animal cruelty to sexually suggestive \ncontent on television and the Internet\u2014just to name a \nfew examples from recent years.  See Reed v. Town of \nGilbert, 576 U.S. 155, 159 (2015); Brown, 564 U.S. at 799; \nStevens, 559 U.S. at 468-69; Playboy, 529 U.S. at 813-14; \nReno, 521 U.S. at 874; see also Barr v. Am. Ass\u2019n of Pol. \nConsultants, Inc., 591 U.S. 610, 618-19 (2020) (plurality \nopinion) (applying strict scrutiny to restrictions on \nrobocalls); id. at 650 (Gorsuch, J., concurring in the \njudgment in part and dissenting in part) (same).  In \nshort, the First Amendment generally \u201cbars the \ngovernment from dictating what we see or read or \nspeak or hear.\u201d  Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coal., 535 U.S. \n234, 245 (2002).  \nThe First Amendment confers that broad protection \nnot because any \u201cone idea is as good as any other\u201d;  the \n\u201cConstitution no more enforces a relativistic philosophy \nor moral nihilism than it does any other point of view.\u201d  \nPlayboy, 529 U.S. at 818.  The First Amendment \nbroadly protects speech because \u201cit is difficult to \ndistinguish\u201d high-value speech from low-value speech \nand \u201cdangerous\u201d for the government \u201cto try.\u201d  Brown, \n564 U.S. at 790.  \u201cWhat is one man\u2019s amusement, \nteaches another\u2019s doctrine.\u201d  Id. (quoting Winters v. \nNew York, 333 U.S. 507, 510 (1948)).  The First \nAmendment \u201cexists precisely so that opinions and \njudgments, including esthetic and moral judgments \nabout art and literature, can be formed, tested, and \nexpressed.\u201d  Playboy, 529 U.S. at 818.  And, with few \nexceptions, those \u201cjudgments are for the individual to \nmake, not for the Government to decree, even with the \nmandate or approval of a majority.\u201d  Id. \n\n18 \n \n \nb.  The Court has long applied these principles to \nspeech involving sex.  Although obscenity is historically \nunprotected, \u201csex and obscenity are not synonymous,\u201d \nand the non-obscene \u201cportrayal of sex \u2026 in art, \nliterature, and scientific works\u201d has never been \nregarded as \u201csufficient reason to deny material the \nconstitutional protection of freedom of speech and \npress.\u201d  Roth v. United States, 354 U.S. 476, 487 (1957).  \nTo the contrary, sex has been \u201ca subject of absorbing \ninterest to mankind through the ages\u201d and remains \u201cone \nof the vital problems of human interest and public \nconcern.\u201d  Id.; see, e.g., Reno, 521 U.S. at 877-78 \n(collecting examples of sexual material \u201cwith serious \neducational or other value\u201d); see also Free Speech Coal., \n535 U.S. at 246-48 (2002) (discussing the theme of sex in \nart and literature dating back to Shakespeare).   \n\u201cSexual expression and imagery were common, \nwidespread, legal, and quite explicit\u201d before and during \nthe Founding era.  Geoffrey R. Stone, Sex and the First \nAmendment, 17 First Amend. L. Rev. 134, 135 (2022).  \nAmerican colonial bookstores \u201ccarried an extraordinary \narray of erotica,\u201d id., and prominent figures \u201clike \nBenjamin Franklin and Thomas Jefferson collected \nmany [such] works,\u201d Geoffrey R. Stone, Sex and the \nConstitution 83 (2017).  Jefferson\u2019s library, for example, \ncontained numerous publications that \u201cportrayed vivid \nscenes of sexuality, lust, and sexual scandal.\u201d  Id.; see 4 \nCatalogue of the Library of Thomas Jefferson 433-36, \n447, 456, 553-54 (E. Millicent Sowerby ed., 1955).  And \nmany Americans \u201cread sex manuals\u201d such as Aristotle\u2019s \nMasterpiece\u2014an \u201cerotic\u201d anthology understood to have \nmedical value.  Vern L. Bullough, An Early American \nSex Manual, Or, Aristotle Who?, 7 Early Am. \nLiterature 236, 236, 241 (1973); see John D\u2019Amelio & \nEstelle B. Freedman, Intimate Matters: A History of \n\n19 \n \n \nSexuality in America 19 (1988) (describing that \u201chighly \npopular\u201d work as \u201ca compendium of reproductive lore\u201d).  \nObjections to such non-obscene sexual publications on \nreligious, moral, aesthetic, and other grounds were \ngenerally pursued through private restrictions, not \npublic laws; \u201cthe distribution, exhibition, and possession \nof pornographic material was simply not thought to be \nany of the state\u2019s business.\u201d  Sex and the First \nAmendment, supra, at 135.   \nIn keeping with that history and understanding, this \nCourt has exercised \u201c[c]easeless vigilance\u201d to protect \nadults\u2019 access to sexual material that does not fall within \nthe definition of obscenity, Roth, 354 U.S. at 488, even \nthough some may \u201cfind [it] shabby, offensive, or even \nugly,\u201d Playboy, 529 U.S. at 826.  That is consistent with \nthe \n\u201cbedrock \nprinciple \nunderlying \nthe \nFirst \nAmendment \u2026 that the government may not prohibit \nthe expression of an idea simply because society finds \nthe idea itself offensive or disagreeable.\u201d  Snyder v. \nPhelps, 562 U.S. 443, 458 (2011) (quoting Texas v. \nJohnson, 491 U.S. 397, 414 (1989)); see Free Speech \nCoal., 535 U.S. at 245 (\u201c[S]peech may not be prohibited \nbecause \nit \nconcerns \nsubjects \noffending \nour \nsensibilities.\u201d).  Indeed, \u201cthe point of all speech \nprotection ... is to shield just those choices of content \nthat in someone\u2019s eyes are misguided, or even hurtful.\u201d  \nSnyder, 562 U.S. at 458 (citation omitted); see 303 \nCreative LLC v. Elenis, 600 U.S. 570, 602 (2023) (\u201cA \ncommitment to speech for only some messages and \nsome persons is no commitment at all.\u201d). \nc.  The distinction between unprotected obscenity \nand protected speech about sex applies to people of all \nages.  In Ginsberg, however, this Court held that the \nline can be drawn in a different place with respect to \n\n20 \n \n \nminors.  390 U.S. at 638.  The Court in Ginsberg upheld \na New York law that prohibited the knowing sale to \nminors of sexual material \u201cdefined to be obscene on the \nbasis of its appeal to them whether or not it would be \nobscene to adults.\u201d  Id. at 631.  Rejecting a challenge \nasserted on behalf of minors, the Court determined that \nthe law permissibly \u201cadjusts the definition of obscenity \n\u2018to social realities by permitting the appeal of this type \nof material to be assessed in term of the sexual \ninterests\u2019\u201d of minors, which differ from those of adults.  \nId. at 638 (quoting Mishkin v. New York, 383 U.S. 502, \n509 (1966)).  Because the line drawn by the state has a \n\u201crational relation to the objective of safeguarding such \nminors from harm,\u201d the Court held, the law did not \nviolate minors\u2019 First Amendment rights.  Id. at 643. \nThe Court\u2019s decision in Ginsberg marks an exception \nto the general principle that minors and adults enjoy the \nsame First Amendment protections, and the Court has \ndeclined to extend Ginsberg beyond the narrow context \nin which it was decided.  See Brown, 564 U.S. at 793-95 \n(rejecting California\u2019s reliance on Ginsberg to prohibit \nthe sale of violent video games to minors).  Most \ncritically for present purposes, however, Ginsberg\u2019s \ntolerance of a more restrictive obscenity definition for \nminors does not in any way diminish the constitutional \nprotection of non-obscene sexual expression for adults.  \nThe law at issue in Ginsberg did not place any \nrestriction on adults\u2019 access to sexual materials; it did \nnot, for example, require sellers to conduct age \nverification of adult customers.  See 390 U.S. at 634.  To \nthe \ncontrary, \nthe \nGinsberg \nCourt \nexpressly \ndistinguished New York\u2019s restriction on minors\u2019 access \nto sexual content from a Michigan law that barred the \nsale to adults and minors of content deemed harmful to \nminors, id.\u2014a law the Court unanimously invalidated as \n\n21 \n \n \nviolating the First Amendment.  Butler v. Michigan, \n352 U.S. 380, 383-84 (1957) (refusing to \u201creduce the \nadult population of Michigan to reading only what is fit \nfor children,\u201d which would impermissibly \u201cburn the \nhouse to roast the pig\u201d). \nThe Court has since reaffirmed in an unbroken line \nof ensuing decisions that a burden on adults\u2019 access to \nsexual material constitutionally protected for them is \nsubject to strict scrutiny even if that burden arises from \na law aimed at restricting minors\u2019 access to sexual \nmaterial that is not constitutionally protected for them.  \nSee, e.g., Reno, 521 U.S. at 975 (\u201c[T]he level of discourse \nreaching a mailbox simply cannot be limited to that \nwhich would be suitable for a sandbox.\u201d (quoting Bolger \nv. Youngs Drug Prods. Corp., 463 U.S. 60, 74-75 (1983)).   \nIn Sable, for example, the Court considered a \nfederal law prohibiting \u201cdial-a-porn\u201d telephone services \ncontaining content that was constitutionally protected \nfor adults but inappropriate for minors.  492 U.S. at 117, \n126.  Given the burden on adults, the Court subjected \nthe law to strict scrutiny.  Id. at 126.  And while the \nCourt accepted the government\u2019s \u201ccompelling interest \nin protecting the physical and psychological well-being \nof minors,\u201d the Court invalidated the law because it \n\u201cwas not sufficiently narrowly drawn \u2026 to serve those \ninterests without unnecessarily interfering with [the] \nFirst Amendment freedoms\u201d of adults.  Id. \nThe Court followed the same approach in Playboy.  \nThere, a federal law required cable-television operators \noffering \nchannels \n\u201cprimarily \ndedicated \nto\u201d \nprogramming that was \u201csexually-oriented\u201d but not \nobscene for adults to either block their channels or \nbroadcast them only late at night, when children were \nnot likely to be watching.  529 U.S. at 806.  The Court \n\n22 \n \n \nagain acknowledged the government\u2019s interest in \nstopping \u201cunwanted, indecent speech\u201d from entering \n\u201cthe home without parental consent,\u201d but emphasized \nthat, because the law burdened adults\u2019 access to sexual \nexpression that is constitutionally protected for them, \nthe \u201cstandard the Government must meet\u201d to restrict \nthat speech \u201cshould be clear:  The standard is strict \nscrutiny.\u201d  Id. at 814.  The Court rejected the argument \nthat a lower level of scrutiny should apply because \nadults could still watch the programming late at night; \nthe Court explained that \u201c[t]he Government\u2019s content-\nbased burdens must satisfy the same rigorous scrutiny \nas its content-based bans.\u201d  Id. at 812.  After finding \nthat effective, less restrictive alternatives existed\u2014for \nexample, \u201ca regime in which viewers could order signal \nblocking on a household-by-household basis\u201d\u2014the \nCourt invalidated the law.  Id. at 807, 826-27. \nIn Reno, the Court extended those principles to \nsexual content specifically on the Internet.  The Court \naffirmed a preliminary injunction of a federal law that \n\u201cprohibit[ed] the knowing transmission of obscene or \nindecent messages\u201d online \u201cto any recipient under 18 \nyears of age,\u201d unless certain age-verification measures \nwere employed.  Reno, 521 U.S. at 859-61.  While \nrecognizing Ginsberg\u2019s holding that the \u201cscope of the \nconstitutional freedom of expression secured to a citizen\u201d \nto access sexually explicit material may \u201cdepend on \nwhether the citizen is an adult or a minor,\u201d the Reno \nCourt followed Playboy and Sable by applying strict \nscrutiny to the statute because it burdened adults\u2019 \naccess to speech that was constitutionally protected for \nthem.  Id. at 864-65, 874-77.  The Court affirmed the \npreliminary injunction, noting the government had \nfailed \u201cto explain why a less restrictive\u201d measure such \n\n23 \n \n \nas content \u201ctagg[ing],\u201d a nascent form of content \nfiltering, would not similarly protect minors.  Id. at 879. \nMost recently, the Court applied the same principles \nto COPA in Ashcroft.  As noted above, COPA prohibited \nthe online transmission of content deemed obscene for \nminors\u2014using Miller\u2019s adult-obscenity standard from \nthe perspective of a minor\u2014unless age-verification \nmeasures were employed.  See pp. 5-6, supra.  As in \nReno, Playboy, and Sable, the Ashcroft Court applied \nstrict scrutiny based on the law\u2019s burden on adults\u2019 \naccess to protected speech.  542 U.S. at 665-66.  The \nCourt then affirmed a preliminary injunction of COPA.  \nIt explained that the use of \u201cblocking and filtering \nsoftware\u201d would be an effective and less restrictive \nmeans of restricting minors\u2019 access to online sexual \ncontent inappropriate for them, while still allowing \nadults to access the \u201cspeech they have a right to see \nwithout having to identify themselves\u201d and thereby \nincur \u201cthe potential chilling effect\u201d of age verification.  \nId. at 666-67.2 \nTaken together, the teaching of those cases is \nunmistakable:  Strict scrutiny applies to laws that \nburden adults\u2019 right to access sexual expression that is \nconstitutionally protected for them, even if those laws \nare aimed at preventing minors\u2019 exposure to that \ncontent.  Indeed, prior to the majority decision below, \nevery court of appeals that encountered a similar law \nreviewed it under strict scrutiny.  See Mukasey, 534 F.3d \nat 190; PSInet v. Chapman, 362 F.3d 227, 229, 233-34 \n \n2  Following remand, the district court permanently enjoined \nCOPA, the Third Circuit affirmed under strict scrutiny, and this \nCourt denied review.  See ACLU v. Mukasey, 534 F.3d 181, 190, \n207 (3d Cir. 2008), cert. denied, 555 U.S. 1137 (2009). \n\n24 \n \n \n(4th Cir. 2004); Am. Booksellers Found. v. Dean, 342 \nF.3d 96, 99-102 (2d Cir. 2003); ACLU v. Johnson, 194 \nF.3d 1149, 1152, 1155-58 (10th Cir. 1999).   \n2. H.B. 1181\u2019s Age-Verification Requirement \nIs A Content-Based Burden On Protected \nSpeech Subject To Strict Scrutiny \nLike the laws in Ashcroft, Playboy, Reno, and Sable, \nH.B. 1181\u2019s age-verification requirement applies to \nspeech that is constitutionally protected for adults and \nimposes a content-based burden on adults\u2019 access to \nthat speech.  It is therefore subject to strict scrutiny.   \na.  The speech covered by H.B. 1181\u2019s age-\nverification requirement is constitutionally protected \nfor adults.  Like COPA, H.B. 1181 applies to speech that \nsatisfies the Miller adult-obscenity test modified to \ncover sexual material that is deemed harmful from the \nperspective of a minor.  Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code \n\u00a7 129B.001(6); see Ashcroft, 542 U.S. at 661-62.  H.B. \n1181, moreover, applies to minors generally\u2014with no \ndistinction between, e.g., a 17-year-old and a 5-year-\nold\u2014so content that would be harmful to even the \nyoungest minor is covered by the statute.  \u201cBecause \nmost sexual content is offensive to young minors, the \nlaw covers virtually all salacious material,\u201d Pet App. \n109a, from nude modeling to romance novels to R-rated \nmovies or television shows for mature audiences, id. at \n51a-52a (Higginbotham, J., dissenting).  That material \nis all undisputedly protected for adults. \nNor is H.B. 1181 directed at speech that is obscene \nfor adults.  Texas separately criminalizes such obscenity, \nleaving no need to subject it to age verification.  Tex. \nPenal Code \u00a7\u00a7 43.21-43.23.  As such, adult obscenity is \nnot part of the constitutional analysis.  See Free Speech \n\n25 \n \n \nCoal., 535 U.S. at 240 (not considering obscene speech \nin the constitutional analysis because the statute at \nissue \u201cis not directed at speech that is obscene\u201d and \n\u201cCongress has proscribed those materials through a \nseparate statute\u201d); Reno, 521 U.S. at 878 n.44 (similar).  \nThe point is so plain that Texas conceded it at oral \nargument below.  Asked whether \u201cthe state take[s] the \nposition that the adults should be able to access all of \nth[e] material\u201d covered by H.B. 1181, or instead \u201cthat \nsome of th[e covered material] is obscene,\u201d the state \nresponded: \u201cadults should still be able to access every \nbit of the materials.\u201d  Official Recording at 13:35-14:00, \nhttps://bit.ly/4c5B42K. \nb.  It is equally clear that H.B. 1181\u2019s age-\nverification requirement is content-based.  The \nrequirement applies only to websites that provide \n\u201csexual material harmful to minors.\u201d  Tex. Civ. Prac. & \nRem. Code \u00a7\u00a7 129B.001(6), 129B.002(a).  This definition \nis content-based on its face and indistinguishable from \nthe one that triggered strict scrutiny in Ashcroft; it is \nlikewise of a piece with the restrictions that triggered \nstrict scrutiny in Reno, Playboy, and Sable.  What is \nmore, H.B. 1181\u2019s content-based definition is especially \nbroad:  it sweeps in all of a website\u2019s non-sexual content \njust because more than one-third of the website \ncontains the targeted sexual content.  Tex. Civ. Prac. & \nRem. Code \u00a7 129B.002(a).3   \nc.  Nor can there be any serious dispute that H.B. \n1181\u2019s age-verification requirement imposes a burden.  \nCovered websites must require adults to provide their \n \n3  The \u201chealth-warnings\u201d mandate likewise applies based on \nthe content of websites\u2019 speech and further compels the utterance \nof particular words.  Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code \u00a7 129B.004.   \n\n26 \n \n \npersonally identifying information whenever they wish \nto access constitutionally protected sexual speech.  As \nis clear from the district court\u2019s unchallenged \nfindings\u2014along with common sense and experience\u2014\nmany adults will understandably be reluctant to do so.  \nPet. \nApp. \n124a-127a. \n \nSubmitting \nidentifying \ninformation online entails risks of \u201cinadvertent \ndisclosures, leaks, or hacks,\u201d all of which are heightened \nbecause the disclosure of personal information here \ncould \u201creveal intimate desires and preferences.\u201d  Pet. \nApp. 125a-126a; see Electronic Frontier Found. (EFF) \nCert. Amicus Br. 6 (elaborating security risks). \nH.B. 1181 does little to assuage these concerns.  \nWhile requiring that age-verification providers \u201cmay \nnot retain any identifying information,\u201d Tex. Civ. Prac. \n& Rem. Code \u00a7 129B.002(b), H.B. 1181 does not prohibit \nthe transmission of such information to third parties, \nincluding to criminals or the state.  It is \u201cdubious,\u201d \nmoreover, that adults will \u201ctrust that companies will \nactually delete it.\u201d  Pet. App. 126a.  Beyond creating \nrisks of potentially devastating identify theft and \nextortion, the law ushers in the chilling prospect that \n\u201cthe state government can log and track adults\u2019 access \nto sexual material.\u201d  Pet. App. 75a (Higginbotham, J., \ndissenting).  And even if those worst-case scenarios are \nnot realized, their specter will have a significant (and \nostensibly designed) deterrent effect.  Pet. App. 126a; \nsee, e.g., Denver Area Educ. Telecomms. Consortium, \nInc. v. FCC, 518 U.S. 727, 754 (1996) (crediting such \nrisks in the context of adults\u2019 access to sexual content).4   \n \n4   The \u201chealth-warnings mandate,\u201d which demands that \nwebsites stigmatize and condemn adult users by \u201cwarning\u201d them \naway, confirms that such deterrence is by design. \n\n27 \n \n \nFor many adults, moreover, H.B. 1181 \u201coperates as \na de facto ban.\u201d  Found. for Individual Rights and \nExpression (FIRE) Cert. Amicus Br. 8.  \u201cTexans who do \nnot possess government identification or whose age or \nidentity are not reliably confirmed by commercial age-\nverification systems will be functionally prohibited from \nvisiting sites\u201d subject to the law.

Amicus Br. 10.  \nIn sum, H.B. 1181\u2019s age-verification requirement \nimposes a content-based burden on the right of adults \nto access speech that is constitutionally protected for \nthem.  Under this Court\u2019s consistent precedent, H.B. \n1181 is therefore subject to strict scrutiny.  See p. 24, \nsupra; see also Pet. App. 47a-48a (Higginbotham, J., \ndissenting); Pet. App. 108a.   \n3. The Fifth Circuit Erred In Applying \nRational-Basis Review To H.B. 1181\u2019s Age-\nVerification Requirement  \nThe Fifth Circuit declined to follow this Court\u2019s well-\nestablished precedent, applying rational-basis review \nrather than strict scrutiny.  Although the court provided \nseveral justifications for its position, none has merit. \na.  As a threshold matter, the Fifth Circuit squarely \ndefied this Court\u2019s decision in Ashcroft, which the panel \nmajority acknowledged applied strict scrutiny to a \nmaterially indistinguishable law.  Pet. App. 4a, 16a.  The \nmajority\u2019s stated basis for doing so was that Ashcroft\u2019s \nfailure to apply rational-basis review under Ginsberg \nwas a \u201cstartling omission[]\u201d that could be explained only \nby the United States\u2019 failure to argue that rational-basis \n\n28 \n \n \nreview applied to COPA; on that view, the majority \ndeemed itself free to adopt a different approach and to \ncredit Texas\u2019s proposal for applying rational-basis \nreview here.  Pet. App. 17a, 26a.  That was not the \ncorrect treatment of this Court\u2019s precedent. \nTo begin, lower federal courts are bound by the \nreasoning and result of this Court\u2019s decisions under the \nprinciple of \u201cvertical stare decisis.\u201d  Ramos v. \nLouisiana, 590 U.S. 83, 124 n.5 (2020) (Kavanaugh, J., \nconcurring in part); see, e.g., Seminole Tribe v. Florida, \n517 U.S. 44, 67 (1996) (\u201cWhen an opinion issues for the \nCourt, it is not only the result but also those portions of \nthe opinion necessary to that result by which we are \nbound.\u201d).  As such, the Fifth Circuit was not free to \ndisregard Ashcroft or any other decision of this Court \nbased on perceived weaknesses in the Court\u2019s analysis.  \nSee, e.g., Agostini v. Felton, 521 U.S. 203, 237 (1997).   \nIn any event, the Fifth Circuit\u2019s reading of Ashcroft \nis wrong.  The United States\u2019 brief in Ashcroft makes \nclear that the reason the government declined to argue \nfor rational-basis review was not an oversight but \ninstead a recognition that this Court had clearly and \nrepeatedly held that strict scrutiny applies to laws like \nCOPA.  See U.S. Br. 18, Ashcroft, supra (No. 03-218) \n(\u201c[B]ecause [COPA] regulates on the basis of content, \n[it] \u2018must be narrowly tailored to promote a compelling \ngovernment interest\u2019 in order to be constitutional under \nthe First Amendment.\u201d (quoting Playboy, 529 U.S. at \n813)).  The Court\u2019s decision in Ashcroft reflects that \nsame understanding.  Eight Justices in Ashcroft applied \nstrict scrutiny: the five Justices in the majority and \nthree of the dissenters, who would have upheld COPA \nunder strict scrutiny.  542 U.S. at 670; see id. at 677 \n(Breyer, J., dissenting, joined by Rehnquist, C.J., and \n\n29 \n \n \nO\u2019Connor, J.).  Only Justice Scalia\u2019s dissent would have \nsubjected COPA to less than strict scrutiny, contending \nthat the covered speech was unprotected and thus \npresumably subject to rational-basis review.  Id. at 676.  \nThat Justice Scalia advocated that position while eight \nJustices concluded otherwise refutes the Fifth Circuit\u2019s \naccount of a \u201cstartling omission[].\u201d  Pet. App. 17a. \nFurthermore, it is implausible that this Court would \nhave felt itself constrained to apply the wrong tier of \nconstitutional scrutiny simply because the parties \npurportedly invoked the wrong legal standard.  Parties \ncannot \u201cstipulate or bind [a court] to the application of \nan incorrect legal standard.\u201d  NetChoice, 144 S. Ct. at \n2429 (Alito, J., concurring in the judgment) (citations \nomitted). At a minimum, it is highly unlikely that the \nCourt would have adopted such a position in a major \nconstitutional case without explaining that it was doing \nso only because of the parties\u2019 arguments\u2014especially \nwhen the precise issue was squarely raised by the \ndissent.  Cf. Haaland v. Brackeen, 599 U.S. 255, 279-80 \n(2023) (explaining that the Court was deferring to the \nparties\u2019 presentation of the arguments); McCullen v. \nCoakley, 573 U.S. 464, 478 (2014) (stating that the Court \nwould \u201cassume, without deciding, that\u201d a particular \n\u201clevel of scrutiny\u201d applied). \nb.  In addition to misreading Ashcroft, the Fifth \nCircuit also misread Ginsberg.  The panel majority \ndrastically reduced the applicable standard from strict \nscrutiny to rational-basis review on the theory that such \na result was necessary to afford continuing vitality to \nGinsberg.  See Pet. App. 19a-20a.  But no such straining \nis necessary to give meaning to Ginsberg.   \nProperly understood, Ginsberg stands for the \nimportant but limited proposition that states can define \n\n30 \n \n \nobscenity more broadly for minors than for adults, and \nthus can restrict minors\u2019 access to a broader range of \nsexual content than they can permissibly restrict for \nadults.  390 U.S. at 638; see Brown, 564 U.S. at 793-94 \n(describing Ginsberg in those terms); Pet. App. 55a, 68a \n(Higginbotham, J., dissenting) (same).  That holding \nreflects the government\u2019s \u201csomewhat broader authority \nto regulate the activities of children,\u201d Planned \nParenthood v. Danforth, 428 U.S. 52, 74-75 (1976) \n(citing Ginsberg, 390 U.S. at 629), but it does not affect \nthe state\u2019s authority to regulate access by adults to \ncontent that is constitutionally protected for them. \nThe Fifth Circuit\u2019s contrary reading does not find \nadequate roots in Ginsberg.  As explained above, \nGinsberg did not involve a law that burdened the speech \nrights of adults while restricting access for minors.  See \npp. 20-21, supra.  The law barred only \u201cknowing[]\u201d sales \nto minors and did not prescribe age verification in any \nform, let alone across all transactions, or otherwise \nrestrict adults\u2019 access.  Ginsberg, 390 U.S. at 633-34.  So \nlong as a vendor did not sell to someone appearing to be \na minor, the law had nothing to say.  See id. at 643-44.  \nThat is why the vendor in Ginsberg appealed his \nconviction by invoking the rights of minors, not adults.  \nSee id. at 636 (\u201c[H]is contention is \u2026 that the scope of \nthe constitutional freedom of expression secured to a \ncitizen to read or see material concerned with sex \ncannot be made to depend upon whether the citizen is \nan adult or a minor.\u201d); see Appellant Br., Ginsberg, \nsupra (No. 47, O.T. 1967), 1967 WL 113634, at *7 (\u201cThe \nappellant\u2019s position is that the restriction on the \ndistribution of literature based on age classification is \ncensorship, pure and simple.\u201d).  The Court rejected the \nargument on those terms, holding that \u201cthe concept of \nobscenity \u2026 may vary according to the group to whom \n\n31 \n \n \nthe questionable material is directed or from whom it is \nquarantined.\u201d  390 U.S. at 636 (citation omitted).  To be \nsure, if the challenge in this case rested on the \nproposition that minors have rights to view sexual \ncontent covered by H.B. 1181, Ginsberg might be \nrelevant.  Recognizing Ginsberg\u2019s continued vitality in \nsuch a circumstance gives that precedent the force it is \ndue, no more and no less.   \nThe \nFifth \nCircuit\u2019s \nposition, \nby \ncontrast, \ncontravenes the decades of precedents after Ginsberg \nthat applied strict scrutiny to laws restricting the \nspeech rights of adults alongside minors.  See pp. 20-24, \nsupra.  Indeed, no other court in the 20 years since \nAshcroft or the 56 years since Ginsberg has even \nsuggested anything like the position adopted by the \nFifth Circuit here.  And the only case addressing such a \nlaw after the Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision relies on Ashcroft \nand Judge Higginbotham\u2019s dissent rather than the \nFifth Circuit majority opinion.  Free Speech Coal., Inc. \nv. Rokita,      F. Supp. 3d     , 2024 WL 3228197, at *7-16 \n(S.D. Ind. June 28, 2024).  Reviewing a nearly identical \nage-verification provision, the district court in that case \nheld that the \u201ccase is not close\u201d and that the law is a \n\u201cdead ringer\u201d for the statute addressed by this Court in \nAshcroft.  Id. at *18.  The court rejected the state\u2019s \nattempts to evade strict scrutiny, which the court held \nis dictated by \u201ceach of\u201d this Court\u2019s cases addressing \nstatutes that burden adults in the course of \u201cseeking to \nprotect \nminors \nfrom \nindecent \nwire \ncommunications.\u201d  Id. at *13.5   \n \n5   On appeal, the Seventh Circuit stayed the resulting \npreliminary injunction without \u201cconsidering the standards \nappropriate to a stay pending appeal on the merits,\u201d on the theory \n \n\n32 \n \n \nc.  The Fifth Circuit briefly suggested that strict \nscrutiny does not apply for the additional reason that \nH.B. 1181\u2019s age-verification requirement constitutes \nonly a speech burden rather than a speech ban.  Pet. \nApp. 16a n.23.  But this Court has never required that a \ncontent-based law actually ban speech to trigger strict \nscrutiny.  To the contrary, the Court has confirmed \nmany times\u2014including in the context of laws restricting \nadults\u2019 access to constitutionally protected sexual \nexpression\u2014that \u201c[t]he Government\u2019s content-based \nburdens must satisfy the same rigorous scrutiny as its \ncontent-based bans.\u201d  Playboy, 529 U.S. at 812 \n(emphases added); see, e.g., Reed, 576 U.S. at 171-72 \n(applying strict scrutiny not to a ban on speech but to a \nregulation governing the size of political signs); Simon \n& Schuster, Inc. v. Members of N.Y. State Crime \nVictims Bd., 502 U.S. 105, 115 (1991) (\u201cA statute is \npresumptively inconsistent with the First Amendment \nif it imposes a financial burden on speakers because of \nthe content of their speech.\u201d); cf. Sorrell v. IMS Health \nInc., 564 U.S. 552, 565-66 (2011) (\u201cLawmakers may no \nmore silence unwanted speech by burdening its \nutterance than by censoring its content.\u201d). \nd.  Finally, the Fifth Circuit suggested it was \nimpelled towards applying rational-basis review for \nfear that states otherwise would lack means of \nprotecting children from harmful sexual content.  Pet. \nApp. 22a-23a.  But in applying strict scrutiny in Sable, \nPlayboy, Reno, and Ashcroft, the Court noted less \n \nsimply that the Indiana and Texas statutes should be treated the \nsame (i.e., not subject to an injunction) pending the Court\u2019s \ndecision in this case.  Free Speech Coal., Inc. v. Rokita, 2024 WL \n3861733, at *1-2 (7th Cir. Aug. 16, 2024) (Rovner, J., concurring in \npart, dissenting in part). \n\n33 \n \n \nrestrictive options each time.  Strict scrutiny is not \u201ca \ndeath knell in and of itself.\u201d  Pet. App. 22a.  The Court \nhas upheld laws under strict First Amendment scrutiny.  \nSee, e.g., Williams-Yulee v. Fla. Bar, 575 U.S. 433, 444, \n457 (2015); Holder v. Humanitarian Law Project, 561 \nU.S. 1, 39 (2010); cf. Citizens United v. FEC, 558 U.S. \n310, 366-67, 371-72 (2010) (upholding disclaimer and \ndisclosure provisions of campaign-finance law because \nthey survived \u201cexacting scrutiny\u201d).  The Court in \nAshcroft expressly stated that a narrowly tailored \n\u201cregulation of the Internet designed to prevent minors \nfrom gaining access to harmful materials\u201d would pass \nmuster, and pointed to less restrictive options.  542 U.S. \nat 666-70, 672.  And the district court in this case \nlikewise acknowledged that there \u201care viable and \nconstitutional means to achieve Texas\u2019s goal\u201d of \nprotecting minors from sexual content online without \nunduly limiting adults\u2019 rights.  Pet. App. 160a.  Adhering \nto strict scrutiny, in sum, would not render states \npowerless to protect minors.  It would merely require \nthem to do so through a carefully tailored law. \nAccepting the Fifth Circuit\u2019s position, by contrast, \ncould invite even more troubling restrictions on speech, \nreaching beyond petitioners\u2019 websites to include \n\u201cbookstores, \nlibraries, \npublishers, \nauthors \nand[] \nmainstream websites,\u201d among others.  Am. Booksellers \nCert. Amicus Br. 1.  After all, if a state seeking to \nprotect minors from harmful sexual content needs only \na rational basis to restrict adults\u2019 access to protected \nspeech, states might attempt to ban the publication of \nsexual content more generally\u2014a seemingly rational \nmechanism to shield minors from sexual content that \ncould harm them.  But see Butler, 352 U.S. at 383-84.  \nNor would the implications of affirmance necessarily be \nlimited to sexual content in the eyes of lower courts.  \n\n34 \n \n \nSeveral states have recently enacted laws requiring \nsocial-media websites to perform age verification \nbefore allowing access to their platforms.  See, e.g., Ark. \nCode \u00a7 4-88-1402; Ga. Code \u00a7\u00a7 39-6-2, 3 (effective July \n1, 2025).  Other states have pursued content-based \nrestrictions on library books or instructional materials \nunder the auspices of protecting minors from \npurportedly harmful speech more broadly.  See, e.g., \nIowa Code \u00a7 256.11; Tenn. Code \u00a7 49-6-1019.  Even if \nthe Fifth Circuit\u2019s reasoning would not apply directly to \nsuch laws, any suggestion that they could be subject to \nmere rational-basis review would lead down a troubling \nroad.  Cf. Stern v. Marshall, 564 U.S. 462, 503 (2011) \n(\u201cSlight encroachments create new boundaries from \nwhich legions of power can seek new territory to \ncapture.\u201d (citation omitted)). \n4. H.B. 1181\u2019s Age-Verification Provision Is \nAlso Subject To Strict Scrutiny Because It \nEmbodies Speaker-Based Discrimination \nH.B. 1181 is subject to struct scrutiny on a separate \nground: it discriminates against particular speakers in \nways that suggest the state\u2019s disapproval of the content \nof their speech.    \na.  \u201cLaws designed or intended to suppress or \nrestrict the expression of specific speakers contradict \nbasic First Amendment principles.\u201d  Playboy, 529 U.S. \nat 812.  Such \u201c[s]peaker-based laws run the risk that \n\u2018the State has left unburdened those speakers whose \nmessages are in accord with its own views.\u2019\u201d  NIFLA, \n585 U.S. at 778 (citation omitted).  Unless the \nchallenged law can survive strict scrutiny, the First \nAmendment \u201cdoes not permit [the government] to \nimpose special prohibitions on those speakers who \n\n35 \n \n \nexpress views on disfavored subjects.\u201d  R.A.V. v. St. \nPaul, 505 U.S. 377, 391 (1992). \nH.B. 1181 squarely implicates those concerns.  It \ndiscriminates based on speaker by targeting the online \npornography industry while leaving unregulated \nidentical sexual content on social-media websites, on \nsearch engines, and on websites that limit their sexual \ncontent to no more than one-third of their total content, \nTex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code \u00a7\u00a7 129B.002, 005.  In \nsubstance, the legislature has singled out the \npornography industry while allowing those outside the \nindustry to purvey the same content without any such \nrestrictions.  See Rokita, 2024 WL 3228197, at *16 \n(explaining that materially identical Indiana law \n\u201cdiscriminates amongst speakers in the marketplace\u201d). \nFar from disguising its true design, Texas \npractically trumpets its censorial intent.  See Br. in Opp. \n1, 4 (boasting of success in limiting the speech of \u201cthe \npornography industry\u201d and describing petitioners\u2019 \nprotected speech as \u201cinexhaustible amounts of [] smut\u201d); \nResp. C.A. Br. 1, 23 (describing H.B. 1181\u2019s target as \n\u201ccommercial purveyors of online pornography\u201d and \ncastigating petitioners as \u201cBig Porn\u201d).  The law\u2019s \nimposition of compelled \u201chealth warnings\u201d make this \nconclusion inescapable, branding, as they do, all \npetitioners\u2019 adult patrons as unwell and needing \npsychiatric treatment.  See  Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code \n\u00a7 129B.004 (capitalization altered); p. 8, supra. \nb.  In concluding otherwise, the panel majority \nstated that H.B. 1181\u2019s exemptions of search engines \nand social media were driven by \u201ca reasonable policy \nchoice \nto \navoid \nthe \nlegal \nconcerns \nthat \naccompany \u2026 regulat[ing] the \u2018entire universe of \ncyberspace.\u2019\u201d  Pet. App. 25a (citing Reno, 521 U.S. at \n\n36 \n \n \n868).  But Texas has shown no compunction about \nregulating the entities that it left out of this law.  See \nNetChoice, 144 S. Ct. at 2408.  More fundamentally, \nexempting social-media websites and search engines \ncannot explain speaker-based discrimination where, as \nhere, it defeats the law\u2019s avowed purpose.  As the \ndistrict court found, H.B. 1181\u2019s exemptions allow \nminors to access, without any restrictions, endless \nvolumes of the same kinds of content that appear on \npetitioners\u2019 sites.  Pet. App. 113a-114a.  Indeed, \n\u201c[Texas\u2019s] own expert suggests that exposure to online \npornography often begins with \u2018misspelled searches,\u2019\u201d \nPet. App. 112a, and \u201c[Texas\u2019s] own study \u2026 points \nout[ that] pop-up ads, not pornographic websites, are \nthe most common forms of sexual material encountered \nby adolescents,\u201d  Pet. App. 131a.  Such \u201cdifferential \ntreatment, \nunless \njustified \nby \nsome \nspecial \ncharacteristic of the\u201d online pornography industry\u2014\nwhich the state has not identified\u2014\u201csuggests that the \ngoal of the regulation is not unrelated to suppression of \nexpression.\u201d  Minneapolis Star & Tribune Co. v. Minn. \nComm\u2019r of Revenue, 460 U.S. 575, 585 (1983). \nThe Fifth Circuit also misread R.A.V., reasoning \nthat the speaker-based \u201c[s]electivity\u201d prohibited by \nthat decision applied to \u201cdifferent sorts of messages, not \ndifferent mediums.\u201d  Pet. App. 25a (citation omitted).  \nBut R.A.V. never cabined its holding in that way, nor did \nit suggest that different rules would govern a speaker-\nbased restriction on another medium.  See 505 U.S. at \n394.  Indeed, this Court has held that an \u201cink and paper \ntax\u201d that \u201csingles out the press\u201d cannot stand for that \nvery reason.  Minneapolis Star, 460 U.S. at 591-92; see \nSmith v. Daily Mail Publ\u2019g Co., 443 U.S. 97, 105-06 \n(1979) (invalidating state law that restricted speech in \nnewspapers but not on radio).  In any event, the search \n\n37 \n \n \nengines and social-media platforms that H.B. 1181 \nexempts are part of the same medium\u2014the Internet\u2014\nas the websites H.B. 1181 targets.  Such a divergent \napproach to regulating the same medium further \nevinces \nspeaker-based \ndiscrimination, \nwhich \nindependently warrants strict scrutiny. \nB. Petitioners Are Likely To Succeed On The \nMerits Of Their Challenge To The Age-\nVerification Requirement In H.B. 1181 \nWhen H.B. 1181\u2019s age-verification provision is \nproperly subjected to strict scrutiny, petitioners satisfy \nthe principal requirement for a preliminary injunction \nbecause  \u201cthey are likely to succeed on the merits.\u201d  \nAshcroft, 542 U.S. at 666.   \n1. To survive strict scrutiny, H.B. 1181 must be \n\u201cnarrowly \ntailored \nto \npromote \na \ncompelling \n[g]overnment interest\u201d and employ the least speech-\nrestrictive means of protecting minors.  Playboy, 529 \nU.S. at 813; see Ashcroft, 542 U.S. at 665-66.  As the \ndistrict court\u2019s undisturbed factual findings make clear, \nTexas cannot come close to satisfying that test.  \nParticularly given this Court\u2019s instruction to \u201cuphold \nthe injunction\u201d if \u201cthe underlying constitutional \nquestion is close,\u201d id. at 664, Texas has no viable path to \nmeeting its heavy burden at this preliminary stage.  \nIndeed, this is if anything an a fortiori case from \nAshcroft, because H.B. 1181 materially replicates \nCOPA while applying to an even wider swath of speech, \nincluding fewer privacy and security protections, and \nexempting channels through which minors can continue \nto access the same sexual content.   \na.  To start, H.B. 1181 is \u201cvastly overinclusive\u201d by \ndesign, restricting through its very structure far more \n\n38 \n \n \nspeech than necessary to accomplish its purported aim.  \nBrown, 564 U.S. at 804.  Because the Act\u2019s requirements \napply to an entire website when any more than one-\nthird of the website\u2019s content falls within the statutory \ndefinition of sexual material harmful to minors, the Act \nburdens substantial amounts of speech that do not \nrelate to its stated purpose.  For example, a website that \ncontains 65% core political speech and 35% sexually \nsuggestive content would be 100% subject to H.B. \n1181\u2019s restrictions.  That is paradigmatic overinclusivity.  \nAs the district court aptly described, H.B. 1181 is akin \nto a restriction on movie theaters requiring them to \n\u201ccatalog all movies that they show, and if at least one-\nthird of those movies are R-rated, \u2026 screen everyone \nat the main entrance for their 18+ identification, \nregardless of what movie they wanted to see.\u201d  Pet. App. \n111a n.5.   \nb.  At the same time, H.B. 1181 is \u201cwildly \nunderinclusive when judged against its asserted \njustification,\u201d which \u201cis alone enough to defeat it.\u201d  \nBrown, 564 U.S. at 802.  Search engines are explicitly \nexempted from the Act\u2019s age-verification requirement, \neven though a minor can conduct an image or video \nsearch to yield \u201csexually explicit or pornographic\u201d \nresults \u201cextracted from [adult] websites regardless of \nage verification.\u201d  Pet. App. 112a.  Likewise, social-\nmedia \nplatforms \nlike \nReddit \n\u201cmaintain \nentire \ncommunities and forums\u201d devoted \u201cto posting online \npornography.\u201d  Pet. App. 113a.  Instagram and \nFacebook similarly contain \u201cmaterial which is sexually \nexplicit for minors.\u201d  Pet. App. 113a.  And a website \ncontaining massive amounts of sexual material obscene \nas to minors can remain unregulated just by adding \ntwice as much non-sexual material.  All of these \nloopholes allow minors to access the very material \n\n39 \n \n \nTexas purportedly wants to protect them from\u2014indeed, \nthe \u201cmaterial most likely to serve as a gateway to \npornography use.\u201d  Pet. App. 114a.  \nSuch significant gaps are \u201cnot how one addresses a \nserious social problem,\u201d and they render H.B. 1181 no \nless underinclusive than other laws that this Court has \ninvalidated under the First Amendment.  Brown, 564 \nU.S. at 802; see, e.g., id. at 805 (striking down a statute \nbarring the sale of violent video games to minors \nbecause it excluded other portrayals of similar violence); \nDenver Area, 518 U.S. at 753, 757, 760 (striking down a \nban on sexual content \u201con leased channels\u201d but \u201cnot on \nother channels\u201d because such content was \u201cbroadcast \nover both kinds of channels\u201d and \u201cthe record before \nCongress \u2026 provides no convincing explanation\u201d for \ndifferential treatment); Daily Mail, 443 U.S. at 104-05 \n(striking \ndown \nlaw \nthat \nprohibited \nnewspaper \npublication \nof \nyouthful \noffenders\u2019 \nnames \nwhile \npermitting publication by \u201celectronic media\u201d).  \nc.  Finally, like the federal government in Ashcroft \nand Reno, Texas fails to show that H.B. 1181 employs \nthe least restrictive means of pursuing its compelling \nend.  Ashcroft, 542 U.S. at 666 (citing Reno, 521 U.S. at \n874).  The district court\u2019s factual findings make clear \nthat less restrictive and more effective alternatives are \nreadily available, chief among them the modern variant \nof the content-filtering software that this Court \nrecognized as a less restrictive alternative to the age-\nverification regime in Ashcroft.  Id. at 666-73; see Pet. \nApp. 133a-135a.  Content-filtering software is installed \n\u201cat the receiving end\u201d\u2014e.g., on individual devices such \nas laptops or smart phones\u2014and prevents those devices \nfrom displaying material from selected websites or \napplications.  Ashcroft, 542 U.S. at 667; see Pet. App. \n\n40 \n \n \n132a, 134a; J.A. 59.  Such software is commonly used by \nemployers and other institutions (likely including \nfederal courts) to limit access to websites deemed \ninappropriate.  See J.A. 280. \nAs explained in Ashcroft, content-filtering software \nis less restrictive of speech than \u201cuniversal restrictions \nat the source\u201d such as mandatory age-verification \nbecause it can restrict minors\u2019 access to inappropriate \ncontent while preserving adults\u2019 \u201caccess to speech they \nhave a right to see without having to identify \nthemselves or provide\u201d sensitive personal information.  \n542 U.S. at 667.  Likewise, content-filtering software \nempowers parents to control the kinds of material their \nchildren are able to view, which by definition provides \nbetter tailoring than a blunt governmental mandate.  Id. \nat 667-68; cf. Mahanoy Area Sch. Dist. v. B.L., 594 U.S. \n180, 201-02 (2021) (Alito, J., concurring) (\u201c[P]arents, not \nthe State, have the primary authority and duty to raise, \neducate, and form the character of their children.\u201d); \nPlayboy, 529 U.S. at 824-25 (emphasizing the goal of \nproviding options for parents in restricting minors\u2019 \naccess to sexual content).  And content-filtering \nsoftware is more effective than age verification, which \nis notoriously \u201csubject to evasion and circumvention\u201d\u2014\nand which can drive minors to dangerous parts of the \ndark web that content filters would block.  Ashcroft, 542 \nU.S. at 667-68; see Int\u2019l Centre for Missing and \nExploited Children (ICMEC) Cert. Amicus Br. 3, 14-16.   \nAs the district court found, all those reasons to \nprefer filtering software ring even truer today.  While \n\u201c[t]he risks of compelled digital verification are just as \nlarge, if not greater\u201d than in 2004, filtering software has \nonly improved and \u201ccan more precisely screen out \nsexual content for minors without limiting access to \n\n41 \n \n \nother speech.\u201d  Pet. App. 127a, 132a.  Moreover, minors \nhave only grown savvier with technology, such as \nVirtual Private Networks (VPNs), that bypass online \nage verification with ease.  Pet. App. 134a; see ICMEC \nCert. Amicus Br. 10-13.  Yet despite this Court\u2019s \ninstruction in Ashcroft that governments \u201cundoubtedly \nmay act to encourage the use of filters\u201d or \u201ctake steps \nto promote their development by industry,\u201d 542 U.S. at \n669, Texas has taken no such steps\u2014or even, as far as \nthe legislative record reflects, considered such less \nrestrictive \nalternatives, \nsee \nPet. \nApp. \n85a \n(Higginbotham, J., dissenting); Pet. App. 135a-136a.6 \n2.  Texas has suggested that, even if H.B. 1181 fails \nstrict scrutiny, it is nevertheless immune from facial \ninvalidation because it permissibly applies to obscene \nspeech that is constitutionally unprotected for adults.  \nBr. in Opp. 22; see NetChoice, LLC, 144 S. Ct. at 2397 \n(explaining that a First Amendment facial challenge \nrequires showing that \u201ca substantial number of [the \nlaw\u2019s] applications are unconstitutional, judged in \nrelation to the statute\u2019s plainly legitimate sweep\u201d \n(citation omitted)).  But as explained above\u2014and as the \nstate conceded in the Fifth Circuit\u2014Texas separately \ncriminalizes obscenity for adults, so the whole point of \n \n6  It would also be less restrictive to pair preinstalled filtering \ntechnology on devices with device-level age-verification measures, \nmeaning that the device would block sexually explicit content by \ndefault until an adult user verifies his or her age on the device.  \nPet. App. 128a; see ICMEC Cert. Amicus Br. 17-19.  Alternatively, \nInternet service providers could by default block sexually explicit \ncontent until adults opt out of the blocking regime.  Pet. App. 128a; \ncf. Playboy, 529 U.S. at 823 (noting that a \u201cwell-promoted \nvoluntary blocking provision\u201d could be a less restrictive means of \npreventing minors\u2019 access to sexual content); Denver Area, 518 \nU.S. at 759 (similar). \n\n42 \n \n \nH.B. 1181 is to impose age verification and other \nburdens on sexual material that is obscene for minors \nbut not for adults.  See pp. 25-26, supra.  H.B. 1181 is \nthus no more immune to a facial challenge than the \nsimilarly structured laws in Reno and Ashcroft, both of \nwhich were challenged facially and subject to \npreliminary injunctions that this Court affirmed.  See \nReno, 521 U.S. at 883, 885; Ashcroft, 542 U.S. at 664, \n672. \nNor is H.B. 1181 susceptible to the analysis that led \nthe Court in NetChoice to question the facial challenges \nat issue.  There, the Court remanded for the lower \ncourts to \u201cask[], as to every covered platform or \nfunction, whether there is an intrusion on protected \neditorial discretion.\u201d  144 S. Ct. at 2398.  The Court \nadded that \u201cit is not hard to see how the answers might \ndiffer\u201d depending on the nature of the platform.  Id.  No \nsuch reasoning applies here, because there are no \ndistinctions among covered websites that entitle some \nto greater constitutional protection than others.  \u201cIt is \nthe structure of the law, and not its application to any \nparticular [website], that renders it unconstitutional.\u201d  \nPet. App. 122a n.10; see Ams. for Prosperity Found. v. \nBonta, 594 U.S. 595, 618 (2021) (similarly finding that a \nlaw that exhibits categorically improper tailoring is \nfacially invalid under the First Amendment).  If \nanything, Texas\u2019s defense of H.B. 1181 focuses on its \napplication to these challengers, which comprise the \ntargeted industry; upon advancing to other applications, \nTexas\u2019s defense becomes that much weaker and the \nlikely unconstitutionality that much clearer.  In other \nwords, the basis for facial unconstitutionality follows a \nfortiori from the success of an as-applied challenge here.  \nSee Order Den. Mot. for Stay Pending Appeal at 4-13, \nFree Speech Coal. v. Rokita, No. 1:24-cv-00980-RLY-\n\n43 \n \n \nMG (S.D. Ind. July 25, 2024), ECF No. 50 (rejecting a \nsimilar NetChoice-based facial challenge argument).   \nC. Petitioners \nSatisfy \nThe \nRemaining \nPreliminary Injunction Factors \nBeyond likelihood of success on the merits, \npetitioners satisfy the other requirements for a \npreliminary injunction.  They are \u201clikely to suffer \nirreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief \u201d \nand \u201cthe balance of equities\u201d and \u201cthe public interest\u201d \nweigh heavily in their favor.  Winter, 555 U.S. at 20. \n\u201cThe loss of First Amendment freedoms, for even \nminimal periods of time, unquestionably constitutes \nirreparable injury.\u201d  Elrod v. Burns, 427 U.S. 347, 373 \n(1976).  With Texas actively filing enforcement actions \nunder H.B. 1181\u2019s age-verification provision, the chill \ninflicted on petitioners\u2019 protected speech is ongoing and \npalpable\u2014thus supplying a paradigmatic basis for a \npreliminary injunction. \nPetitioners also face the additional irreparable harm \nof bearing the unrecoverable costs of complying with an \nunconstitutional law.  Indeed, \u201ccomplying with a \nregulation later held invalid almost always produces \nthe irreparable harm of nonrecoverable compliance \ncosts.\u201d  Thunder Basin Coal Co. v. Reich, 510 U.S. 200, \n220-21 (1994) (Scalia, J., concurring).  Given Texas\u2019s \nsovereign immunity from claims for money damages, \nsee Pet. App. 157a, petitioners face mounting financial \nburdens of complying with the law (either by \nimplementing costly measures or by abandoning \noperations) if the preliminary injunction is not restored. \nAs for the equities, they merge with the public \ninterest, see Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 435 (2009), \nand strongly favor petitioners.  States have no interest \n\n44 \n \n \nin enforcing unconstitutional laws, particularly laws \nthat are as ineffective and ill-suited to their avowed \npurpose as H.B. 1181 is.  See Gordon v. Holder, 721 F.3d \n638, 653 (D.C. Cir. 2013) (\u201c[E]nforcement of an \nunconstitutional law is always contrary to the public \ninterest.\u201d).  \nFinally, as in Ashcroft, restoring the preliminary \ninjunction will not end this case.  See 542 U.S. at 672-73. \nTo the extent a factual dispute remains as to H.B. 1181\u2019s \ntailoring and the least restrictive means, both sides may \nbenefit from a more fulsome factual record.  See Pet. \nApp. 85a (Higginbotham, J., dissenting).  In this respect, \ntoo, proper resolution of this case follows from Reno and \nAshcroft, which affirmed preliminary injunctions of like \nlaws while \u201callow[ing] the parties to update and \nsupplement the factual record to reflect current \ntechnological realities.\u201d  Ashcroft, 542 U.S. at 672. \nCONCLUSION \nThe judgment of the court of appeals should be \nreversed.   \n \n \n\n45 \n \n \nRespectfully submitted. \nDAVID D.

          "task_beliefs": "My model of the case is undergoing a crucial self-correction. While the evidentiary landscape concerning the technology at issue remains one-sided, I now recognize that my analysis has been incomplete. My current prediction is therefore qualified as provisional, pending a foundational review of the petitioners' core arguments.\n\n1.  **Central Legal Conflict (Stable):** The core tension remains between *Sable Communications of Cal., Inc. v. FCC* and *Ashcroft v. ACLU (Ashcroft II)*, which protect adult access to non-obscene speech, and *Ginsberg v. New York*, which allows states to regulate minors' access to material deemed harmful to them. The resolution hinges on whether \"changed circumstances\" (i.e., new technology) can satisfy the strict scrutiny standard established in *Ashcroft II*.\n\n2.  **Respondent's Argumentative Structure (Strong but Incompletely Contextualized):** The respondent's (Texas's) position, particularly its fallback argument, remains strong based on the current evidentiary record.\n    *   **Primary Argument (Rational Basis):** The plausibility of this argument is still tied to the perceived burden of the law.\n    *   **Fallback Position (Strict Scrutiny):** This position is factually well-supported by the Yoti amicus brief, which provides unrebutted expert claims that modern age verification is the \"least restrictive means.\" The absence of a countervailing technical amicus brief remains a powerful signal that there may be no credible expert opinion to the contrary.\n    *   **Radical Alternative (Overrule *Ashcroft II*):** This remains a very low-probability outcome.\n\n3.  **Prediction & Key Variable (Confidence Qualified):** My prediction that the Court will uphold the Texas law, while still my leading hypothesis, is now explicitly **provisional**. It is based heavily on the analysis of the respondent's arguments and the amicus briefs (the \"antithesis\") without a full analysis of the petitioners' opening brief (the \"thesis\"). The key variable\u2014**Is modern age-verification technology the least restrictive means?**\u2014still leans \"yes\" based on the one-sided factual record. However, I have not yet seen how the petitioners frame this issue legally in their primary filing.\n\n4.  **Current Analytical Focus (Re-sequenced and Refined):** My focus has pivoted. While the petitioners' reply brief (due Dec 23) is still critical for seeing their rebuttal to the Yoti brief, a more immediate and foundational task has been identified: **analyzing the petitioners' main brief on the merits.** This document contains their primary legal arguments and framing of the case. Understanding this \"thesis\" is essential before I can properly evaluate the respondent's \"antithesis\" or predict the final \"synthesis.\" My immediate goal is to locate and analyze this foundational document.\n\n5.  **Key Factual Record (One-Sided but Awaiting Legal Framing):** The technical details from the Yoti brief (AI Facial Age Estimation, privacy tokens, NIST benchmarks) constitute the entirety of the expert technical record before the Court. This remains a significant advantage for the respondent. However, the legal significance of these facts depends on the argumentative framework, which I have yet to fully grasp from the petitioners' side.\n\n6.  **Procedural Timeline (Stable):** The timeline is unchanged, but my internal prioritization has shifted. The petitioners' main brief is now the most important document for my immediate analysis, followed by their reply brief in December.",
          "design_beliefs": "This internal reasoning step has been highly instructive, highlighting the risk of analytical tunnel vision and reinforcing the need for a systematic, foundational approach. My methodology has been refined to ensure a more complete and logically sequenced analysis.\n\n1.  **Leverage Internal Structure:** Validated.\n2.  **Identify Argumentative Patterns:** Validated.\n3.  **Map Competing Precedents:** The *Sable-Ashcroft* vs. *Ginsberg* model is stable.\n4.  **Deconstruct Argumentative Hierarchies:** Confirmed.\n5.  **Analyze Framing as a Core Strategy:** Validated.\n6.  **Interpret Procedural Filings as Structural Data:** Validated.\n7.  **Adopt a Dialectical Approach (Refined):** This remains a core strategy. This observation highlights a critical component of its application: one must consciously seek out and analyze the \"thesis\" (the opening argument) and the \"antithesis\" (the response) before attempting a \"synthesis\" (the prediction). Jumping to the antithesis or supporting documents without understanding the thesis can lead to a skewed perspective.\n8.  **Employ a \"Consolidate, Plan, and Target Uncertainty\" Meta-Heuristic (Validated):** This process has proven its value again. After consolidating my knowledge, I identified a major gap in my own analysis\u2014the lack of focus on the petitioners' main brief\u2014and have now planned a targeted action to remedy it. This demonstrates the heuristic's power for self-correction.\n9.  **Analyze Amicus Briefs as a Strategic Tool:** The principle that the *absence* of a brief can be an evidentiary signal is confirmed.\n10. **Prioritize Amicus Briefs from Subject-Matter Experts:** Confirmed.\n11. **Interpret Negative Search Results as Evidence:** Confirmed.\n12. **Acknowledge Tool Limitations:** Confirmed.\n13. **Prioritize Foundational Documents (New Principle):** Before conducting an in-depth analysis of responsive filings (like respondent's briefs or amicus briefs), it is essential to first analyze the foundational documents that initiate the legal debate\u2014specifically, the petitioner's brief on the merits. This establishes the \"thesis\" and provides the necessary context for all subsequent arguments. This sequencing prevents analytical blind spots caused by focusing too early on a single, salient piece of responsive evidence."

          "task_beliefs": "My model of the case has undergone a significant and necessary correction. By obtaining and analyzing the petitioners' brief on the merits, I have filled a critical gap in my understanding, moving from a provisional, respondent-focused hypothesis to a more balanced and nuanced view of the central legal conflict.\n\n1.  **Central Legal Conflict (Refined and Sharpened):** The core tension remains between the *Sable-Ashcroft* line of cases (protecting adult access) and *Ginsberg* (allowing regulation for minors). However, the petitioners' brief frames this not as a simple balancing act, but as a question of *stare decisis* and judicial error. Their primary argument is that the Fifth Circuit was not free to disregard the direct precedent of *Ashcroft v. ACLU (Ashcroft II)*, which applied strict scrutiny to a nearly identical federal law (COPA). They argue the Fifth Circuit's justification\u2014that *Ashcroft II* was based on a government \"concession\"\u2014is a misreading of the case and an improper deviation from established Supreme Court doctrine. This shifts the focus from \"which precedent applies?\" to \"was the lower court allowed to ignore the most recent, on-point precedent?\"\n\n2.  **Petitioners' Argumentative Structure (Now Fully Mapped):** I now have a clear view of the \"thesis\" of the case:\n    *   **Primary Argument (Standard of Review):** H.B. 1181 is a content-based law that burdens adults' access to protected speech. Decades of precedent, culminating in *Ashcroft II*, mandate the application of strict scrutiny. The Fifth Circuit's application of rational basis review was a fundamental legal error.\n    *   **Fallback Argument (Failure of Strict Scrutiny):** Even if the Court re-evaluates the issue under strict scrutiny, the law fails.\n        *   **Less Restrictive Alternative:** They explicitly identify \"content-filtering software\" as a less restrictive and more effective alternative, directly echoing the Supreme Court's reasoning in *Ashcroft II*. They argue this technology has only improved, strengthening the argument against mandatory age verification.\n        *   **Not Narrowly Tailored:** The law is both overinclusive (chilling vast amounts of protected speech for adults due to privacy/security risks of providing ID) and underinclusive (it exempts major platforms like search engines and social media, undermining the claim that the law is necessary to achieve its stated interest).\n        *   **Compelled Speech:** The law's requirement to post \"stigmatizing, unscientific\" health warnings is an independent First Amendment violation.\n\n3.  **Respondent's Argumentative Structure (Re-contextualized):** The strength of Texas's anticipated argument is now situated within a powerful counter-framework.\n    *   **Primary Argument (Rational Basis):** This now appears as a defense of the Fifth Circuit's controversial decision to sidestep *Ashcroft II*, a difficult position to defend before the Supreme Court.\n    *   **Fallback Position (Strict Scrutiny):** The factual claims in the Yoti amicus brief\u2014that modern age verification is effective and privacy-protecting\u2014are no longer unrebutted. They are now directly countered by the petitioners' legal argument that a less restrictive alternative (filtering software) exists, making the effectiveness of age verification legally secondary. The debate is no longer just \"Is this technology feasible?\" but \"Is this technology the *least restrictive means available*?\"\n\n4.  **Prediction & Key Variable (Confidence Radically Shifted):** My provisional prediction that the Court would uphold the law is now significantly weakened. My confidence has shifted from leaning toward the respondent to leaning toward the petitioner (reversal of the Fifth Circuit). The petitioners' arguments are grounded in direct, on-point Supreme Court precedent (*Ashcroft II*), while the respondent's position requires convincing the Court to either overrule *Ashcroft II* or accept the Fifth Circuit's highly unusual basis for distinguishing it. The key variable, \"Is modern age-verification technology the least restrictive means?\", has been reframed. The existence and improvement of filtering software, as argued by the petitioners, provides a strong \"no\" answer that is consistent with the Court's own prior reasoning.\n\n5.  **Current Analytical Focus:** The next critical document is the **Respondent's Brief on the Merits**. I need to see how Texas defends the Fifth Circuit's reasoning, how they distinguish *Ashcroft II*, and how they rebut the argument that filtering software is a less restrictive alternative. Their response to the underinclusivity argument (exempting search engines) will also be crucial.",
          "design_beliefs": "This update cycle has powerfully validated and refined my methodological principles, particularly regarding the sequencing of analysis and the interpretation of legal documents.\n\n1.  **Leverage Internal Structure:** Validated.\n2.  **Identify Argumentative Patterns:** Validated.\n3.  **Map Competing Precedents:** Validated. The model of *Sable-Ashcroft* vs. *Ginsberg* was correct, and the new data shows how petitioners are framing *Ashcroft* as the definitive, controlling precedent.\n4.  **Deconstruct Argumentative Hierarchies:** Validated. The petitioners' brief clearly prioritizes the \"standard of review\" argument, knowing that winning on that point makes the rest of their case much simpler.\n5.  **Analyze Framing as a Core Strategy:** Validated. The petitioners' framing of the case as one of lower court error in defying *stare decisis* is a powerful strategic choice.\n6.  **Interpret Procedural Filings as Structural Data:** Validated.\n7.  **Adopt a Dialectical Approach (Strongly Validated):** This observation is the ultimate proof of this heuristic's value. My analysis was fundamentally skewed by examining a piece of the \"antithesis\" (the Yoti amicus brief) before understanding the \"thesis\" (the petitioner's opening brief). The synthesis is only possible after both sides are understood in their own terms.\n8.  **Employ a \"Consolidate, Plan, and Target Uncertainty\" Meta-Heuristic:** Validated. This process led me to identify the missing brief, and acquiring it has resolved a major source of uncertainty and corrected my entire model of the case.\n9.  **Analyze Amicus Briefs as a Strategic Tool:** Validated.\n10. **Prioritize Amicus Briefs from Subject-Matter Experts:** Confirmed.\n11. **Interpret Negative Search Results as Evidence (Refined):** My previous belief that the absence of a technical amicus for the petitioners was a strong negative signal is now refined. The significance of an absent brief is relative to the party's core legal strategy. Because the petitioners' argument focuses on the legal status of a *different* technology (filtering software) as a less restrictive alternative, their lack of a technical expert to rebut Yoti is less damaging than I initially presumed. They are sidestepping a direct technical battle in favor of a legal one based on precedent.\n12. **Acknowledge Tool Limitations:** Confirmed.\n13. **Prioritize Foundational Documents (Elevated to Core Principle):** This is the most critical lesson learned. An analyst *must* begin with the document that frames the debate (the petitioner's brief on the merits) before evaluating responses or supporting materials. Failure to do so creates a high risk of confirmation bias and analytical distortion, as demonstrated by my own prior beliefs.\n14. **Use the Table of Authorities as a Strategic Map (New Principle):** The Table of Authorities in a legal brief is not just a list of citations; it is a high-level map of the legal battlefield. The frequency and prominence of certain cases (e.g., the dozens of references to *Ashcroft II*) provide an immediate, quantitative signal of the brief's core strategy and argumentative dependencies. This is a highly efficient heuristic for rapid analysis."

Ginsberg v. New York, 390 U.S. 629, 634-35 \n(1968). Nevertheless, Petitioners insist that because they \nhave moved their business online, the First Amendment \nprotects their right to distribute a nearly inexhaustible \namount of obscenity to any child with a smartphone. \nFor nearly thirty years, due to technological limita-\ntions, governments have struggled to translate Ginsberg \nfrom bookstores to the internet. See Ashcroft v. ACLU \n(Ashcroft II), 542 U.S. 656 (2004); Reno v. ACLU, 521 \nU.S. 844 (1997). Technology, however, has evolved: \nAround the world, websites can and do create adult-only \nzones where adults can view materials unsuited for chil-\ndren. The question presented here is thus: \n \nGiven that a State may, consistent with the Constitu-\ntion, restrict minors\u2019 access to pornographic materials, \nwhether it is facially unconstitutional for a State to re-\nquire a commercial entity that provides such materials to \ntake commercially reasonable steps to verify the age of \nits customers. \n \n\n \n(II) \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nPage \nQuestion Presented ...........................................................

Like \n\u201cdoomscrolling\u201d on social media, online pornographers \nuse sophisticated algorithms to keep adults who have \ngreater maturity than children on their sites. Childhood \naccess to this avalanche of misogynistic and often violent \nsmut \u201c\u2018is creating a public health crisis.\u2019\u201d Marc Novicoff, \nA Simple Law is Doing the Impossible. It\u2019s Making the \nOnline Porn Industry Retreat, Politico (Aug. 8, 2023) \n(quoting Louisiana age-verification bill), https://ti-\nnyurl.com/Novicoff2023.  \nIn 2023, the Texas Legislature\u2014voting 164 to 1\u2014ad-\ndressed this crisis by enacting House Bill 1181 (\u201cH.B. \n1181\u201d). H.B. 1181 does not prevent adults from viewing \npornography. Instead, it requires online pornographers \nto take commercially reasonable steps to ensure that \ntheir customers are not children. Nor is H.B. 1181 an out-\nlier. Countries all around the world require online por-\nnographers to use age-verification technology.     \n \nPetitioners say little about what they sell. But even \nthey admit (at 3) that Texas has a compelling interest in \npreventing children from viewing the content on their \nwebsites. This Court has held\u2014\u201ccategorically\u201d\u2014that \n\u201cobscene material is unprotected by the First Amend-\nment,\u201d Miller v. California, 413 U.S. 15, 23 (1973), and \nhas emphasized that States may prevent \u201cthe sale to mi-\nnors of sexual material that would be obscene from the \nperspective of a child \u2026 so long as the legislature\u2019s judg-\nment that the proscribed materials [are] harmful to chil-\ndren \u2018[is] not irrational.\u2019\u201d Brown v. Ent. Merchs. Ass\u2019n, \n564 U.S. 786, 793-94 (2011) (quoting Ginsberg, 390 U.S. \n\n2 \n \nat 641). States thus can require brick-and-mortar retail-\ners peddling obscenity to verify the ages of their custom-\ners. Ginsberg, 390 U.S. at 634-35. Indeed, all \u201c50 States\u201d \nbar minors from buying \u201cpornographic materials.\u201d \nThompson v. Oklahoma, 487 U.S. 815, 824 (1988). \n \nBecause no one disputes that Texas can prevent kids \nfrom accessing hardcore pornography, this case is about \nmeans, not ends. Petitioners would prefer that the pro-\ntection of children be left to device manufacturers. But \nwhere, as here, the level of constitutional protection de-\npends on the identity of the listener, a State can require \nthe speaker to serve as a gatekeeper. See Sable \nCommc\u2019ns of Cal., Inc. v. FCC, 492 U.S. 115, 125-26 \n(1989). That principle of law has not changed just be-\ncause obscenity has moved online. \n \nEven if Ginsberg were inapplicable in cyberspace, \nhowever, H.B. 1181 would still easily survive. Texas \nseeks to protect kids from some of the most prurient sex-\nual content imaginable. And the means Texas has chosen \nis appropriate. Texas has addressed only websites dedi-\ncated to pornography, has allowed them to comply by us-\ning common age-verification technology, and has not im-\nposed criminal penalties. Such a modest but important \nlaw satisfies any level of scrutiny.   \n \nThat point is especially true, moreover, in the posture \nof a facial, pre-enforcement preliminary injunction. Peti-\ntioners\u2019 decision to facially challenge H.B. 1181 \u201ccomes \nat a cost.\u201d Moody v. NetChoice, 144 S.Ct. 2383, 2397 \n(2024). They must show that \u201ca substantial number of \n[the law\u2019s] applications are unconstitutional, judged in \nrelation to the statute\u2019s plainly legitimate sweep.\u201d Id. \nThey cannot because much of the content on their web-\nsites is obscene even for adults. No one has a constitu-\ntional right to view \u201cteen bondage gangbang\u201d videos, \n\n3 \n \nmuch less hundreds of thousands of them. J.A.176. And \nbecause this case concerns the extraordinary remedy of \na preliminary injunction, Petitioners must show more \nthan just a substantial likelihood of success on the mer-\nits. Yet they have not identified a single person who has \nbeen chilled. By any measure, the Fifth Circuit correctly \nvacated the district court\u2019s flawed injunction. \n \nSTATEMENT \nI. Children and Online Pornography \nA. The online pornography industry \n1. Petitioners say almost nothing about what\u2019s on \ntheir websites. Suffice it to say, they are not streaming \n\u201cromance novels or R-rated movies.\u201d Contra Pet.Br.1. \nPetitioners include (1) an association of pornographic ac-\ntors, producers, distributors, and retailers; (2) foreign \nand domestic producers, sellers, and licensers of pornog-\nraphy; and (3) Jane Doe, a pornographic performer. \nROA.19-24.1 Petitioner MG Freesites Ltd. operates \nPornhub\u2014\u201cthe 12th most visited website in the world \u2026 \nahead of Amazon, TikTok, and LinkedIn.\u201d Bradley \nSaacks, Inside Pornhub\u2019s Finances, Semafor (Jul. 27, \n2023), https://perma.cc/EC8Q-3FEU; ROA.21. \n \nOnline pornographers are sophisticated. Like social-\nmedia companies, they use complex algorithms to hook \nusers. See, e.g., Amy Adler, Arousal by Algorithm, 109 \nCornell L. Rev. 787, 811 (2024). Their content triggers \nneurological effects akin to gambling. See Todd Love et \nal., Neuroscience of Internet Pornography Addiction: A \nReview and Update, 5(3) Behavioral Sciences 388 (2015); \nsee also J.A.254 (H.B. 1181 bill analysis noting that por-\nnography is biologically addictive). \n \n1 \u201cROA\u201d refers to the record on appeal. \n\n4 \n \n \nPetitioners\u2019 business models generally fall into two \ncategories: \nadvertisement-based \nand \nsubscription-\nbased. The first generates revenue from \u201cadvertising \nplacements on its website and through referral fees.\u201d \nROA.249. The second generates revenue from subscrip-\ntions\u2014often paid for with personal credit cards, com-\nplete with identifying information. ROA.250-51.  \n2. As online pornographers have become more so-\nphisticated, the type of content they display has also \nchanged. Now, websites use their \u201cextraordinary trove \nof user data to script pornography (often using A/B test-\ning), giving data-driven specific requirements to porn \nproducers to fulfill.\u201d Adler, supra, at 813. This creates \nwhat one scholar has identified as an \u201cA.I.-driven feed-\nback loop\u201d in which pornography \u201cgains the capacity to \ncrystalize, amplify, and distort desire itself.\u201d Id. \n \n\u201cMost of today\u2019s pornography,\u201d moreover, \u201cdoes not \nreflect consensual, loving, healthy relationships\u201d but \n\u201cteaches dominance, aggression, disrespect, and objecti-\nfication.\u201d Byrin Romney, Screens, Teens, and Porn \nScenes: Legislative Approaches to Protecting Youth \nfrom Exposure to Pornography, 45 Vt. L. Rev. 43, 43 \n(2020) (emphasis omitted). For example, and Texas re-\ncites the following with considerable reluctance, in one of \nPetitioner Xnxx\u2019s more than 300,000 free videos of \u201cteen \nbondage gangbang[s],\u201d five men tie a young woman down \nwith electrical tape and take turns penetrating her \norally, vaginally, and anally\u2014sometimes simultaneously. \nJ.A.176. In this 36-minute video\u2014viewed more than \n650,000 times as of August 2023\u2014the men choke the \nwoman and eventually strap an open-mouth gag or \n\u201cmouth spreader\u201d over her head, forcing her mouth open \nwhile they ejaculate in it. J.A.176.  \nThis video is far from unique. Gagging, slapping, hair \n\n5 \n \npulling, spanking, and increasingly choking are the five \nmost common forms of physical aggression found in por-\nnography, and women are the targets of such violence \n97% of the time. J.A.158. In 2020, Pornhub removed \u201cmil-\nlions of videos\u2014the majority of its content\u2014after an in-\nvestigation revealed a large number of them featured un-\nderaged and sex-trafficked subjects.\u201d Kari Paul, Porn-\nhub Removes Millions of Videos After Investigation \nFinds Child Abuse Content, The Guardian (Dec. 14, \n2020), https://perma.cc/MXU8-6KFC. Even so, one of \nPetitioner\u2019s sites recently listed 306,230 videos of \u201cper-\nfect girl porn,\u201d 579,497 videos of \u201cteen hardcore\u201d porn, \nand 328,273 videos of \u201cyoung petite porn.\u201d ROA.399. \nAnother popular category is hentai, a cartoon intro-\nduction to violent pornography which commonly features \n\u201ca grotesque creature penetrating a girl with an enor-\nmous phallus or tentacle\u201d\u2014acts which, if performed in \nreal life, would result in severe injury or death. J.A.159-\n60. Pornhub alone hosts over 100,000 of these videos. \nJ.A.159. And for customers whose tastes in domination \nand humiliation run to particular races, Petitioners have \nthat, too. One site offers 88,713 free videos of \u201cAsian \nbondage\u201d and another 91,203 of \u201cEbony bondage.\u201d \nJ.A.175. Unsurprisingly, \u201c[t]he pornography industry \nremains a bastion of explicit anti-black stereotyping\u2014\nraw, obscene, and increasing mainstreamed.\u201d David Pil-\ngrim, The Jezebel Stereotype (updated 2024), Jim Crow \nMuseum, https://perma.cc/2VT8-LVFU.  \n3. The astounding amount of online obscenity con-\ntinues to grow. Pornhub alone transferred 6,597 \npetabytes of data in 2019. Romney, supra, at 50. That \nrepresents \u201c1.36 million hours (169 years) of new con-\ntent\u201d\u2014more data than the entire internet in 2002, id. and \n90,000 times the Library of Congress, Matt Raymond, \n\n6 \n \nHow \u2018Big\u2019 is the Library of Congress?, Libr. of Cong. \nBlogs (Feb. 11, 2009), https://perma.cc/TQ5B-4NYD. Be-\nfore being forced to remove millions of its videos when \n\u201ccredit [card] companies \u2026 cut ties with\u201d it for hosting \n\u201cinappropriate and illegal videos,\u201d Paul, supra, Pornhub \nbragged that if you \u201cstarted watching 2019\u2019s new videos \nin 1850, you would still be watching them today.\u201d J.A.177. \nFurthermore, artificial intelligence is revolutionizing \nthe industry. See, e.g., Leo Herrera, AI and the Future \nof \nSex, \nMIT \nTech. \nRev. \n(Aug. \n26, \n2024), \nhttps://perma.cc/SH8C-Q6PN. \u201cUsers can now check \nboxes on a list of options as long as the Cheesecake Fac-\ntory menu \u2026: categories like male, female, and trans; \nages from 18 to 90; breast and penis size; details like \u2026 \nunderwear color; backdrops like grocery stores, \nchurches, the Eiffel Tower, and Stonehenge; even \nweather.\u201d Id. It is also possible to furtively create por-\nnography involving people in one\u2019s daily life. Id. \nB. The effects of pornography on children \n1. Pornography harms children, a fact Petitioners \nnowhere deny. Repeated exposure may trigger disasso-\nciation, \u201cdepression,\u201d and psychosomatic symptoms such \nas \u201cheadache, irritability, [and] trouble sleeping.\u201d \nJ.A.160, 162. Children who view pornography are more \nlikely to use tobacco, alcohol, or drugs and disengage \nfrom school. J.A.161. They have less social integration \nand decreased emotional attachment with caregivers. \nJ.A.160. They also experience \u201cpoor social functioning, \nimpulsiveness, and social anxiety,\u201d and \u201cdysfunctional \nstress responses and poor executive function,\u201d as well as \n\u201cimpairments to judgment, memory, and emotional reg-\nulation.\u201d J.A.162. They may also develop unrealistic ex-\npectations about their appearance. J.A.163.   \nChildren who habitually view pornography are more \n\n7 \n \nlikely to exhibit behavioral problems such as emulating \nsexual strangulation, dating violence, and sexual coer-\ncion. J.A.160-163. In fact, \u201c42% of 15-16-year-olds ex-\npressed the desire to mirror pornography\u2014and more \nthan half of all boys believe that online porn depicts re-\nalistic sexuality.\u201d J.A.161. Adolescent viewers are thus at \nhigher risk of intimate partner cyberstalking and adult \nperpetration of child sexual abuse. J.A.160-61, 164. For \ngirls, early exposure to online pornography is a risk fac-\ntor for later suffering sexual abuse, sexual coercion, and \nsexual aggression. J.A.161. And all children exposed to \npornography are \u201cmore likely to display hypersexualiza-\ntion and to develop paraphilias (e.g., exhibitionism, vo-\nyeurism).\u201d J.A.161. \nThe dramatic rise of \u201cchoking\u201d well illustrates the \ndanger, given that it is \u201cdefined by medical science as \n\u2018nonfatal strangulation\u2019\u201d and \u201cposes grave neurological \nharms to victims, including unconsciousness, brain in-\njury, seizure, motor and speech disorders, memory loss,\u201d \nand PTSD. J.A.158. Not by coincidence, children mirror \nsuch dangerous conduct. See, e.g., Peggy Orenstein, The \nTroubling Trend in Teenage Sex, N.Y. Times (Apr. 12, \n2024), https://tinyurl.com/2mp4z4j2 (tying the alarming \nspike of \u201csexual strangulation\u201d of girls \u201cbetween the ages \n[of] 12 and 17\u201d to online pornography, where such behav-\nior has become a \u201cstaple\u201d). \nFar from rebutting this trend, Petitioners\u2019 own evi-\ndence confirms that \u201call signs point to the idea that main-\nstream online pornography appears to negatively influ-\nence youth in several ways.\u201d ROA.1637.

Ginsberg v. New York, 390 U.S. 629, 634-35 \n(1968). Nevertheless, Petitioners insist that because they \nhave moved their business online, the First Amendment \nprotects their right to distribute a nearly inexhaustible \namount of obscenity to any child with a smartphone. \nFor nearly thirty years, due to technological limita-\ntions, governments have struggled to translate Ginsberg \nfrom bookstores to the internet. See Ashcroft v. ACLU \n(Ashcroft II), 542 U.S. 656 (2004); Reno v. ACLU, 521 \nU.S. 844 (1997). Technology, however, has evolved: \nAround the world, websites can and do create adult-only \nzones where adults can view materials unsuited for chil-\ndren. The question presented here is thus: \n \nGiven that a State may, consistent with the Constitu-\ntion, restrict minors\u2019 access to pornographic materials, \nwhether it is facially unconstitutional for a State to re-\nquire a commercial entity that provides such materials to \ntake commercially reasonable steps to verify the age of \nits customers. \n \n\n \n(II) \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nPage \nQuestion Presented ...........................................................

Like \n\u201cdoomscrolling\u201d on social media, online pornographers \nuse sophisticated algorithms to keep adults who have \ngreater maturity than children on their sites. Childhood \naccess to this avalanche of misogynistic and often violent \nsmut \u201c\u2018is creating a public health crisis.\u2019\u201d Marc Novicoff, \nA Simple Law is Doing the Impossible. It\u2019s Making the \nOnline Porn Industry Retreat, Politico (Aug. 8, 2023) \n(quoting Louisiana age-verification bill), https://ti-\nnyurl.com/Novicoff2023.  \nIn 2023, the Texas Legislature\u2014voting 164 to 1\u2014ad-\ndressed this crisis by enacting House Bill 1181 (\u201cH.B. \n1181\u201d). H.B. 1181 does not prevent adults from viewing \npornography. Instead, it requires online pornographers \nto take commercially reasonable steps to ensure that \ntheir customers are not children. Nor is H.B. 1181 an out-\nlier. Countries all around the world require online por-\nnographers to use age-verification technology.     \n \nPetitioners say little about what they sell. But even \nthey admit (at 3) that Texas has a compelling interest in \npreventing children from viewing the content on their \nwebsites. This Court has held\u2014\u201ccategorically\u201d\u2014that \n\u201cobscene material is unprotected by the First Amend-\nment,\u201d Miller v. California, 413 U.S. 15, 23 (1973), and \nhas emphasized that States may prevent \u201cthe sale to mi-\nnors of sexual material that would be obscene from the \nperspective of a child \u2026 so long as the legislature\u2019s judg-\nment that the proscribed materials [are] harmful to chil-\ndren \u2018[is] not irrational.\u2019\u201d Brown v. Ent. Merchs. Ass\u2019n, \n564 U.S. 786, 793-94 (2011) (quoting Ginsberg, 390 U.S. \n\n2 \n \nat 641). States thus can require brick-and-mortar retail-\ners peddling obscenity to verify the ages of their custom-\ners. Ginsberg, 390 U.S. at 634-35. Indeed, all \u201c50 States\u201d \nbar minors from buying \u201cpornographic materials.\u201d \nThompson v. Oklahoma, 487 U.S. 815, 824 (1988). \n \nBecause no one disputes that Texas can prevent kids \nfrom accessing hardcore pornography, this case is about \nmeans, not ends. Petitioners would prefer that the pro-\ntection of children be left to device manufacturers. But \nwhere, as here, the level of constitutional protection de-\npends on the identity of the listener, a State can require \nthe speaker to serve as a gatekeeper. See Sable \nCommc\u2019ns of Cal., Inc. v. FCC, 492 U.S. 115, 125-26 \n(1989). That principle of law has not changed just be-\ncause obscenity has moved online. \n \nEven if Ginsberg were inapplicable in cyberspace, \nhowever, H.B. 1181 would still easily survive. Texas \nseeks to protect kids from some of the most prurient sex-\nual content imaginable. And the means Texas has chosen \nis appropriate. Texas has addressed only websites dedi-\ncated to pornography, has allowed them to comply by us-\ning common age-verification technology, and has not im-\nposed criminal penalties. Such a modest but important \nlaw satisfies any level of scrutiny.   \n \nThat point is especially true, moreover, in the posture \nof a facial, pre-enforcement preliminary injunction. Peti-\ntioners\u2019 decision to facially challenge H.B. 1181 \u201ccomes \nat a cost.\u201d Moody v. NetChoice, 144 S.Ct. 2383, 2397 \n(2024). They must show that \u201ca substantial number of \n[the law\u2019s] applications are unconstitutional, judged in \nrelation to the statute\u2019s plainly legitimate sweep.\u201d Id. \nThey cannot because much of the content on their web-\nsites is obscene even for adults. No one has a constitu-\ntional right to view \u201cteen bondage gangbang\u201d videos, \n\n3 \n \nmuch less hundreds of thousands of them. J.A.176. And \nbecause this case concerns the extraordinary remedy of \na preliminary injunction, Petitioners must show more \nthan just a substantial likelihood of success on the mer-\nits. Yet they have not identified a single person who has \nbeen chilled. By any measure, the Fifth Circuit correctly \nvacated the district court\u2019s flawed injunction. \n \nSTATEMENT \nI. Children and Online Pornography \nA. The online pornography industry \n1. Petitioners say almost nothing about what\u2019s on \ntheir websites. Suffice it to say, they are not streaming \n\u201cromance novels or R-rated movies.\u201d Contra Pet.Br.1. \nPetitioners include (1) an association of pornographic ac-\ntors, producers, distributors, and retailers; (2) foreign \nand domestic producers, sellers, and licensers of pornog-\nraphy; and (3) Jane Doe, a pornographic performer. \nROA.19-24.1 Petitioner MG Freesites Ltd. operates \nPornhub\u2014\u201cthe 12th most visited website in the world \u2026 \nahead of Amazon, TikTok, and LinkedIn.\u201d Bradley \nSaacks, Inside Pornhub\u2019s Finances, Semafor (Jul. 27, \n2023), https://perma.cc/EC8Q-3FEU; ROA.21. \n \nOnline pornographers are sophisticated. Like social-\nmedia companies, they use complex algorithms to hook \nusers. See, e.g., Amy Adler, Arousal by Algorithm, 109 \nCornell L. Rev. 787, 811 (2024). Their content triggers \nneurological effects akin to gambling. See Todd Love et \nal., Neuroscience of Internet Pornography Addiction: A \nReview and Update, 5(3) Behavioral Sciences 388 (2015); \nsee also J.A.254 (H.B. 1181 bill analysis noting that por-\nnography is biologically addictive). \n \n1 \u201cROA\u201d refers to the record on appeal. \n\n4 \n \n \nPetitioners\u2019 business models generally fall into two \ncategories: \nadvertisement-based \nand \nsubscription-\nbased. The first generates revenue from \u201cadvertising \nplacements on its website and through referral fees.\u201d \nROA.249. The second generates revenue from subscrip-\ntions\u2014often paid for with personal credit cards, com-\nplete with identifying information. ROA.250-51.  \n2. As online pornographers have become more so-\nphisticated, the type of content they display has also \nchanged. Now, websites use their \u201cextraordinary trove \nof user data to script pornography (often using A/B test-\ning), giving data-driven specific requirements to porn \nproducers to fulfill.\u201d Adler, supra, at 813. This creates \nwhat one scholar has identified as an \u201cA.I.-driven feed-\nback loop\u201d in which pornography \u201cgains the capacity to \ncrystalize, amplify, and distort desire itself.\u201d Id. \n \n\u201cMost of today\u2019s pornography,\u201d moreover, \u201cdoes not \nreflect consensual, loving, healthy relationships\u201d but \n\u201cteaches dominance, aggression, disrespect, and objecti-\nfication.\u201d Byrin Romney, Screens, Teens, and Porn \nScenes: Legislative Approaches to Protecting Youth \nfrom Exposure to Pornography, 45 Vt. L. Rev. 43, 43 \n(2020) (emphasis omitted). For example, and Texas re-\ncites the following with considerable reluctance, in one of \nPetitioner Xnxx\u2019s more than 300,000 free videos of \u201cteen \nbondage gangbang[s],\u201d five men tie a young woman down \nwith electrical tape and take turns penetrating her \norally, vaginally, and anally\u2014sometimes simultaneously. \nJ.A.176. In this 36-minute video\u2014viewed more than \n650,000 times as of August 2023\u2014the men choke the \nwoman and eventually strap an open-mouth gag or \n\u201cmouth spreader\u201d over her head, forcing her mouth open \nwhile they ejaculate in it. J.A.176.  \nThis video is far from unique. Gagging, slapping, hair \n\n5 \n \npulling, spanking, and increasingly choking are the five \nmost common forms of physical aggression found in por-\nnography, and women are the targets of such violence \n97% of the time. J.A.158. In 2020, Pornhub removed \u201cmil-\nlions of videos\u2014the majority of its content\u2014after an in-\nvestigation revealed a large number of them featured un-\nderaged and sex-trafficked subjects.\u201d Kari Paul, Porn-\nhub Removes Millions of Videos After Investigation \nFinds Child Abuse Content, The Guardian (Dec. 14, \n2020), https://perma.cc/MXU8-6KFC. Even so, one of \nPetitioner\u2019s sites recently listed 306,230 videos of \u201cper-\nfect girl porn,\u201d 579,497 videos of \u201cteen hardcore\u201d porn, \nand 328,273 videos of \u201cyoung petite porn.\u201d ROA.399. \nAnother popular category is hentai, a cartoon intro-\nduction to violent pornography which commonly features \n\u201ca grotesque creature penetrating a girl with an enor-\nmous phallus or tentacle\u201d\u2014acts which, if performed in \nreal life, would result in severe injury or death. J.A.159-\n60. Pornhub alone hosts over 100,000 of these videos. \nJ.A.159. And for customers whose tastes in domination \nand humiliation run to particular races, Petitioners have \nthat, too. One site offers 88,713 free videos of \u201cAsian \nbondage\u201d and another 91,203 of \u201cEbony bondage.\u201d \nJ.A.175. Unsurprisingly, \u201c[t]he pornography industry \nremains a bastion of explicit anti-black stereotyping\u2014\nraw, obscene, and increasing mainstreamed.\u201d David Pil-\ngrim, The Jezebel Stereotype (updated 2024), Jim Crow \nMuseum, https://perma.cc/2VT8-LVFU.  \n3. The astounding amount of online obscenity con-\ntinues to grow. Pornhub alone transferred 6,597 \npetabytes of data in 2019. Romney, supra, at 50. That \nrepresents \u201c1.36 million hours (169 years) of new con-\ntent\u201d\u2014more data than the entire internet in 2002, id. and \n90,000 times the Library of Congress, Matt Raymond, \n\n6 \n \nHow \u2018Big\u2019 is the Library of Congress?, Libr. of Cong. \nBlogs (Feb. 11, 2009), https://perma.cc/TQ5B-4NYD. Be-\nfore being forced to remove millions of its videos when \n\u201ccredit [card] companies \u2026 cut ties with\u201d it for hosting \n\u201cinappropriate and illegal videos,\u201d Paul, supra, Pornhub \nbragged that if you \u201cstarted watching 2019\u2019s new videos \nin 1850, you would still be watching them today.\u201d J.A.177. \nFurthermore, artificial intelligence is revolutionizing \nthe industry. See, e.g., Leo Herrera, AI and the Future \nof \nSex, \nMIT \nTech. \nRev. \n(Aug. \n26, \n2024), \nhttps://perma.cc/SH8C-Q6PN. \u201cUsers can now check \nboxes on a list of options as long as the Cheesecake Fac-\ntory menu \u2026: categories like male, female, and trans; \nages from 18 to 90; breast and penis size; details like \u2026 \nunderwear color; backdrops like grocery stores, \nchurches, the Eiffel Tower, and Stonehenge; even \nweather.\u201d Id. It is also possible to furtively create por-\nnography involving people in one\u2019s daily life. Id. \nB. The effects of pornography on children \n1. Pornography harms children, a fact Petitioners \nnowhere deny. Repeated exposure may trigger disasso-\nciation, \u201cdepression,\u201d and psychosomatic symptoms such \nas \u201cheadache, irritability, [and] trouble sleeping.\u201d \nJ.A.160, 162. Children who view pornography are more \nlikely to use tobacco, alcohol, or drugs and disengage \nfrom school. J.A.161. They have less social integration \nand decreased emotional attachment with caregivers. \nJ.A.160. They also experience \u201cpoor social functioning, \nimpulsiveness, and social anxiety,\u201d and \u201cdysfunctional \nstress responses and poor executive function,\u201d as well as \n\u201cimpairments to judgment, memory, and emotional reg-\nulation.\u201d J.A.162. They may also develop unrealistic ex-\npectations about their appearance. J.A.163.   \nChildren who habitually view pornography are more \n\n7 \n \nlikely to exhibit behavioral problems such as emulating \nsexual strangulation, dating violence, and sexual coer-\ncion. J.A.160-163. In fact, \u201c42% of 15-16-year-olds ex-\npressed the desire to mirror pornography\u2014and more \nthan half of all boys believe that online porn depicts re-\nalistic sexuality.\u201d J.A.161. Adolescent viewers are thus at \nhigher risk of intimate partner cyberstalking and adult \nperpetration of child sexual abuse. J.A.160-61, 164. For \ngirls, early exposure to online pornography is a risk fac-\ntor for later suffering sexual abuse, sexual coercion, and \nsexual aggression. J.A.161. And all children exposed to \npornography are \u201cmore likely to display hypersexualiza-\ntion and to develop paraphilias (e.g., exhibitionism, vo-\nyeurism).\u201d J.A.161. \nThe dramatic rise of \u201cchoking\u201d well illustrates the \ndanger, given that it is \u201cdefined by medical science as \n\u2018nonfatal strangulation\u2019\u201d and \u201cposes grave neurological \nharms to victims, including unconsciousness, brain in-\njury, seizure, motor and speech disorders, memory loss,\u201d \nand PTSD. J.A.158. Not by coincidence, children mirror \nsuch dangerous conduct. See, e.g., Peggy Orenstein, The \nTroubling Trend in Teenage Sex, N.Y. Times (Apr. 12, \n2024), https://tinyurl.com/2mp4z4j2 (tying the alarming \nspike of \u201csexual strangulation\u201d of girls \u201cbetween the ages \n[of] 12 and 17\u201d to online pornography, where such behav-\nior has become a \u201cstaple\u201d). \nFar from rebutting this trend, Petitioners\u2019 own evi-\ndence confirms that \u201call signs point to the idea that main-\nstream online pornography appears to negatively influ-\nence youth in several ways.\u201d ROA.1637. It may \u201cnega-\ntively influence attitudes towards women,\u201d \u201ccause de-\npression, anxiety, decreases in well-being, reduced self-\nesteem,\u201d and cause \u201crisker sexual behaviors (such as \ncondom non-use), a likelihood to experience unhealthy \n\n8 \n \ndating relationships, [and] a tendency to perpetrate \nand/or experience sexual violence.\u201d ROA.1637-39. \nC. Children\u2019s exposure to online pornography \nChildhood exposure to obscenity has increased as \nonline pornography\u2019s reach and sophistication has \ngrown. In fact, \u201capproximately one in five youth experi-\nence unwanted online exposure to sexually explicit mate-\nrial.\u201d J.A.241 (bill analysis for H.B. 1181). \nThe last two decades have also seen a dramatic in-\ncrease in the number of children under 13 exposed to \npornography\u2014despite content filtering. In 2006, just \nover 25% of children aged 13 or younger were exposed to \nonline pornography. See Chiara Sabina, et al., The Na-\nture and Dynamics of Internet Pornography Exposure \nfor Youth, 11 CyberPsychology & Behavior 691, 692 \n(2008). By 2022, that number more than doubled to 54%. \nSee Michael B. Robb & Supreet Mann, Common Sense \nMedia, \nTeens \nand \nPornography \nat \n5 \n(2022), \nhttps://perma.cc/YG3L-W3LK. And the number of chil-\ndren exposed to online pornography at age 10 or younger \nincreased more than seven-fold from less than 2% in 2008 \nto 15% by 2022. Id; Sabina, supra at 692.  \n \nIf the picture these statistics paint was not disturbing \nenough, it becomes even darker when the kind of por-\nnography is considered. Over a third of boys exposed to \npornography reported viewing \u201c[s]exual activity involv-\ning bondage\u201d; almost a third, \u201c[s]exual activity between \npeople and animals\u201d; over a fifth, \u201c[s]exual activity in-\nvolving urine or feces\u201d; and almost that many, \u201c[r]ape or \nsexual violence.\u201d Sabina, supra, at 693. And all of that \nwas before the explosion of smartphones. Today, \u201cusing \nsmartphones to access free pornography online is the \nmost common means of viewing pornographic material.\u201d \nAmanda Giordano, What to Know About Adolescent \n\n9 \n \nPornography Exposure, Psychology Today (Feb. 27, \n2022), https://tinyurl.com/GiordanoPsych. \n \nD. Age-verification technology \n1. Age verification is a generic term that refers to a \nset of techniques and technologies to determine some-\none\u2019s likely age. J.A.49. It is used for any number of age-\nrestricted products and services such as online gambling, \nalcohol and tobacco sales, and car rentals. J.A.194, 198. \nSuch technology can determine a person\u2019s age in various \nways, including by government identification, credit \ncards, credit checks, bank records, and even age estima-\ntion through facial, voice, or behavioral analysis. J.A.188-\n91. Age may also be inferred by the existence of some \nother fact\u2014for example, someone who is a commercial \nairline pilot must be over 18. J.A.187, 189.  \nAge verification often does not take place on the web-\nsite that requires it. J.A.185. Instead, a person can obtain \nverification from a third-party provider by downloading \nan age-verification app (such as Yoti) or visiting an age-\nverification provider\u2019s website. J.A.185-86, 189, 201. An \nage-restricted website can also redirect customers to a \nthird-party provider, who typically offers consumers \ntheir choice of age-verification method. J.A.186. Regard-\nless of how a person first contacts a third-party provider, \nthat provider usually relays to the purveyor of the age-\nrestricted product only the answer to a single question: \nIs this person 18 years or older? Yes or No. J.A.185.  \nThis process is not one that adults must undertake \nevery time they wish to access pornographic material on \nthe internet. Instead, an age-verified person may travel \nthrough the internet with a token that signifies their sta-\ntus as an adult\u2014and nothing more\u2014to each age-re-\nstricted website they visit. J.A.186, 197-98.  \n2. Age verification has become an increasingly \n\n10 \n \ncommon feature of online commerce. The pornographic \nwebsite OnlyFans, for example, uses Yoti, one of the \nworld\u2019s largest third-party providers. J.A.181. And after \nthe public relations and legal crises resulting in the re-\nmoval of millions of videos, Pornhub also began using \nYoti to verify the ages of content providers\u2014but not con-\ntent viewers. J.A.181. Pornhub and others have age-ver-\nification technology built into their systems. J.A.285. \nCountries around the world require age verification \nfor online pornography, including Australia, France, \nGermany, and the United Kingdom. Last year, the Eu-\nropean Union ordered three of the largest online pornog-\nraphers (Pornhub, XVideos and Stripchat) to verify the \nage of users. BBC, Porn Viewers in EU May Have to \nProve Their Age (Dec. 20, 2023), https://perma.cc/Y3R2-\nGXLV.  \nNor does age verification suggest that an adult views \npornography. J.A.203. This service \u201cis widely used by \nthousands of sellers and their consumers on a daily basis \naround the world, in a variety of contexts\u201d that have \nnothing to do with pornography. J.A.181, 209. For exam-\nple, the millions of customers who use DraftKings for \nfantasy sports betting must verify their ages using a \nthird-party verification provider. See, e.g., IDTech, So-\ncure to Provide Biometric Onboarding Tech for \nDraftKings (Apr. 9, 2021), https://perma.cc/7VFG-\nWTDX. Age verification thus is not only doable\u2014it\u2019s al-\nready being done. J.A.181, 209. \nII. H.B. 1181 \nIn H.B. 1181, Texas enacted an age-verification re-\nquirement to address three realities: (1) the internet con-\ntains vast amounts of obscenity easily accessed by kids, \n(2) today\u2019s online obscenity is especially harmful to chil-\ndren, and (3) age-verification technology is increasingly \n\n11 \n \ncommon across industries and allows websites to identify \nwhen their customers are children.  \nSpecifically, H.B. 1181 requires pornographic web-\nsites to \u201cuse reasonable age verification methods\u201d to ver-\nify that a customer \u201cis 18 years of age or older.\u201d Tex. Civ. \nPrac. & Rem. Code \u00a7129B.002(a).2 It applies to commer-\ncial entities that \u201cknowingly and intentionally publish[] \nor distribute[] material on an Internet website, including \na social media platform, more than one-third of which is \nsexual material harmful to minors.\u201d Id.  \nH.B. 1181 defines \u201c[s]exual material harmful to mi-\nnors\u201d based on this Court\u2019s test for obscenity to encom-\npass material that (1) \u201cappeal[s] to or pander[s] to the \nprurient interest\u201d when taken as a whole and with re-\nspect to minors; (2) describes, displays or depicts \u201cin a \nmanner patently offensive with respect to minors\u201d vari-\nous sex acts and portions of the human anatomy, includ-\ning depictions of \u201csexual intercourse, masturbation, sod-\nomy, bestiality, oral copulation, flagellation, [and] excre-\ntory functions\u201d; and (3) \u201clacks serious literary, artistic, \npolitical, or scientific value for minors.\u201d Id. \u00a7129B.001(6); \ncompare Miller, 413 U.S. at 24-25.  \nTo comply with H.B. 1181, a covered website need not \nchange anything it posts. Instead, it must require cus-\ntomers to (1) \u201cprovide digital identification\u201d or (2) \u201ccom-\nply with a commercial age verification system that veri-\nfies age using\u201d a \u201cgovernment-issued identification\u201d or \n\u201ccommercially reasonable method that relies on public or \nprivate transactional data to verify the age of an \n \n2 H.B. 1181 also requires such websites to provide health warn-\nings about the dangers of pornography. Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. \nCode \u00a7129B.004(1). The district court enjoined that provision, \nPet.App.136a-50a; the Fifth Circuit affirmed the injunction, \nPet.App.27a-38a; and Texas has not sought relief from this Court. \n\n12 \n \nindividual.\u201d Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code \u00a7129B.003(b). \nCovered websites thus may use third-party providers \nlike Yoti. And to ensure user privacy, the age-verifier \n\u201cmay not retain any identifying information of the indi-\nvidual.\u201d Id. \u00a7129B.002(b). And, of course, if a covered \nwebsite is concerned that an age-verification provider \nmay wrongly transmit information to others, it can \nchoose a different provider or do age verification itself. \nId. \u00a7129B.003(b). \nH.B. 1181 empowers the Attorney General to bring \ncivil-enforcement actions for injunctive relief, civil pen-\nalties, and attorneys\u2019 fees and costs. Id. \u00a7129B.006.  \nIII. Procedural History \nH.B. 1181 was to go into effect on September 1, 2023. \nPet.App.175a. On August 4, 2023, Petitioners brought a \npre-enforcement facial challenge. ROA.16-46. No adult \nviewer of pornography in Texas joined the suit. ROA.20. \nAs relevant here, Petitioners allege that H.B. 1181\u2019s \nage-verification requirement violates the First Amend-\nment. ROA.42-43. They moved for a preliminary injunc-\ntion, ROA.54-83, and the district court held a hearing less \nthan three weeks later, ROA.1829-96. The only live wit-\nness was the State\u2019s expert, J.A.267-86, who explained \nthat age verification is \u201cnot new\u201d for pornographic web-\nsites, which \u201cuse it elsewhere in the world,\u201d J.A.285.  \nEight days later, the district court\u2014applying strict \nscrutiny\u2014issued a preliminary injunction facially enjoin-\ning enforcement of H.B. 1181\u2019s age-verification require-\nment. Pet.App.107a-36a. Yet rather than evaluating the \n\u201cfull range\u201d of H.B. 1181\u2019s applications and then deter-\nmining whether the law\u2019s supposedly \u201cunconstitutional \napplications substantially outweigh its constitutional \nones,\u201d NetChoice, 144 S.Ct. at 2397, the court refused to \nview even a sample of the content on Petitioners\u2019 \n\n13 \n \nwebsites, ROA.1881. Instead, it insisted that mainstream \nmovies with partial nudity and simulated sex like those \non Netflix are \u201cas raw as any pornography,\u201d ROA.1877-\n78; but see J.A.175 (Xnxx.com\u2019s six categories of \u201cbond-\nage\u201d videos). \nThe Fifth Circuit administratively stayed the district \ncourt\u2019s preliminary injunction and expedited oral argu-\nment. Pet.App.167a-68a. A month later, the court stayed \nthe injunction pending resolution of the appeal. \nPet.App.165a-66a. In March 2024, the Fifth Circuit va-\ncated the injunction of H.B. 1181\u2019s age-verification re-\nquirement. Pet.App.8a-27a. It relied on Ginsberg to con-\nclude that \u201cregulations of the distribution to minors of \nmaterials obscene for minors are subject only to ra-\ntional-basis review.\u201d Pet.App.8a. The court distinguished \nReno because the law there was far broader than H.B. \n1181 and Ashcroft II because it did not consider which \nlevel of scrutiny applied. Pet.App.13a-19a. The Fifth Cir-\ncuit then \u201ceasily\u201d concluded Texas satisfied rational-ba-\nsis review. Pet.App.26a-27a. Judge Higginbotham dis-\nsented, concluding that strict scrutiny applied because \nH.B. 1181 limited adult access to protected speech, \nPet.App.47a-48a, and content filtering and the like are \nless restrictive alternatives, Pet.App.76a-78a.3 \nThe Fifth Circuit thereafter denied Petitioners\u2019 re-\nquest to stay issuance of its mandate. Pet.App.162a-63a. \nThis Court denied Petitioners\u2019 emergency application to \nstay the mandate on April 30, 2024. Accordingly, H.B. \n1181\u2019s age-verification requirement has been in effect \nsince September 19, 2023. Following the Fifth Circuit\u2019s \ndecision, moreover, one prominent pornography website \n \n3 Petitioners also made arguments about vagueness or whether \nthey fall within H.B. 1181\u2019s scope. They do not advance such argu-\nments here.    \n\n14 \n \ncommitted to using an age-verification service. See Press \nRelease, Office of Attorney General of Texas, Texas Se-\ncures Settlement with Operator of Major Pornography \nWebsite, Ensuring Compliance with Texas Law (Apr. \n26, 2024), https://perma.cc/UV63-WPX9.  \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \n\u201cFor the first time in the history of humanity, chil-\ndren can easily be exposed to the most extreme, miso-\ngynistic sex acts imaginable, thanks to the phenomenon \nof Internet porn.\u201d David Horsey, Our Social Experi-\nment: Kids with Access to Hard-Core Porn, L.A. Times \n(Sept. 3, 2013), https://perma.cc/9DGH-NZBN. That \u201cso-\ncial experiment,\u201d id., has failed. To address a public-\nhealth crisis, Texas did not restrict adult access to por-\nnography. Instead, Texas imposed an age-verification \nrequirement\u2014just as governments have done the world \nover for this industry and others. Petitioners cannot \nshow that H.B. 1181 is unconstitutional under the correct \nlevel of scrutiny\u2014rational basis\u2014or any other. And they \nespecially cannot make that showing in the context of a \nfacial, pre-enforcement preliminary injunction.   \nI. The Fifth Circuit followed Ginsberg and Sable. \nWhere the level of constitutional scrutiny depends on the \nnature of the audience, Sable allows a State to put the \nonus on the speaker to serve as the gatekeeper. And \nGinsberg\u2014which upheld a State\u2019s power to require \nbrick-and-mortar retailers to prevent children from \nviewing obscenity\u2014employs a rational-basis test.   \nPetitioners offer a bevy of counterarguments, but \neach misfires. H.B. 1181 is not \u201ccontent based\u201d because \nthe question it asks is whether the content is constitu-\ntionally protected in the first place. Such threshold de-\nterminations have never been subjected to strict-scru-\ntiny review. See, e.g., United States v. Stevens, 559 U.S. \n\n15 \n \n460, 468-69 (2010). Otherwise, a State could not criminal-\nize speech that facilitates crime without triggering strict \nscrutiny. And the suggestion that States cannot express \ndisapproval of obscenity\u2014a \u201cvalueless\u201d category of \nspeech, Counterman v. Colorado, 600 U.S. 66, 73 \n(2023)\u2014turns the First Amendment on its head.    \nNor did Ashcroft II overrule Sable and Ginsberg. Be-\ncause it is just as easy for websites to ensure that those \nwishing to gamble, buy alcohol, or view pornography are \nadults as it is for brick-and-mortar shopkeepers, Texas \nacted well within its police power by imposing that re-\nquirement on websites trafficking in hardcore pornogra-\nphy. And if Ashcroft II prevents Texas from requiring \nPetitioners to use the same age-verification services as \ncomparable websites, Ashcroft II must be overruled. Re-\nliable age verification was not on the table twenty years \nago. That is not remotely true today.   \nII.  Even if heightened scrutiny applied, the prelimi-\nnary injunction would still fail. Any heightened standard \ncould only be intermediate scrutiny, but H.B. 1181 would \nclear even strict scrutiny. Not only is Texas\u2019s interest \noverwhelming, H.B. 1181 focuses on websites causing the \nmost harm to children. And as more than two decades of \nfailed filtering confirms, Texas cannot vindicate its inter-\nest in any other way.  \nAgain, Petitioners\u2019 counterarguments fail. They say \nthat H.B. 1181 is not narrowly tailored because Texas \ndoes not regulate every website where obscenity is avail-\nable. Yet Texas \u201cmay focus on [its] most pressing con-\ncerns\u201d and \u201cneed not address all aspects of [the] problem \nin one fell swoop.\u201d Williams-Yulee v. Fla. Bar, 575 U.S. \n433, 449 (2015). Petitioners also urge content filtering \nbut cannot show it is \u201cat least as effective\u201d as age verifi-\ncation. Reno, 521 U.S. at 874. To the contrary, despite \n\n16 \n \nwidespread availability, filtering \u201chas proven an ineffec-\ntive mechanism.\u201d J.A.207.  \nIII. Petitioners also cannot successfully bring a facial \nchallenge. Because such challenges \u201crest on speculation\u201d \nabout how a law will be interpreted and what the facts \nwill reveal, a plaintiff ordinarily must show that the law \nis \u201cunconstitutional in all of its applications.\u201d Wash. State \nGrange v. Wash. State Republican Party, 552 U.S. 442, \n449-50 (2008). Although the Court has shown greater so-\nlicitude to free-speech claims, see, e.g., NetChoice, 144 \nS.Ct. at 2397, a facial injunction blocking enforcement of \na state law is \u201cstrong medicine\u201d presenting significant \nseparation-of-powers concerns, Broadrick v. Oklahoma, \n413 U.S. 601, 613 (1973).  \nPetitioners have not come close to meeting their bur-\nden. Even on the incomplete record before the Court, \nmuch of the content here is plainly obscene\u2014and thus \nconstitutionally unprotected\u2014even for adults. The dis-\ntrict court, however, committed a more egregious ver-\nsion of the error identified in NetChoice. Not only did it \nfail to consider each application of H.B. 1181, it did not \neven consider H.B. 1181\u2019s heartland. Instead, it specu-\nlated about hypothetical applications while refusing to \nreview the content squarely at issue. Petitioners, how-\never, cannot complain that their adult customers\u2019 consti-\ntutional rights have been chilled based on content that \nthose customers have no constitutional right to view. \nIV. Finally, a preliminary injunction is an \u201cextraordi-\nnary remedy\u201d that is never awarded as of right. Winter \nv. NRDC, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 24 (2008). Instead, a plaintiff \n\u201cmust establish\u201d not only \u201cthat he is likely to succeed on \nthe merits,\u201d but also \u201cthat he is likely to suffer irrepara-\nble harm in the absence of preliminary relief\u201d and \u201cthat \nan injunction is in the public interest.\u201d Id. at 20. Here, \n\n17 \n \neven if Petitioners satisfied their burden with respect to \nthe merits, they flunked the other requirements. They \ndid not identify a single adult who has been chilled from \nvisiting their websites, and they cannot show that any \n(nonexistent) injury outweighs harm to children. En-\nforcement of H.B. 1181 has been permitted for more than \na year and the sky has not fallen. The Court should retain \nthat status quo while litigation continues.   \nARGUMENT \nI. The Fifth Circuit Applied the Correct Test. \nBecause H.B. 1181 imposes a gatekeeping function \nthat forecloses only minors from accessing obscenity, \nthe Fifth Circuit properly applied Ginsberg\u2019s rational-\nbasis analysis. Pet.App.8a-10a. Petitioners do not ques-\ntion that Ginsberg states the proper test for minors\u2019 ac-\ncess to such content, only (at 20-21) whether Ginsberg \napplies when the question is whether prohibiting access \nby minors allegedly impedes access by adults. Petition-\ners are wrong: Requiring commercial enterprises to take \ncommercially reasonable steps to verify that their cus-\ntomers are adults need only be a rational way to combat \nthe harms that even Petitioners accept (at 3) their prod-\nucts cause children. \nA. Ginsberg\u2019s rational-basis test governs. \n1. In Ginsberg, New York took this Court\u2019s then-ex-\nisting definition of obscenity and adjusted it for kids. 390 \nU.S. at 635. Thus, the State decreed that material \n\u201c[h]armful to minors\u201d included content that \u201cpredomi-\nnantly appeals to the prurient, shameful or morbid inter-\nest of minors\u201d and \u201cis utterly without redeeming social \nimportance for minors,\u201d among other elements. Id. at \n646. New York then made it unlawful for businesses to \nknowingly sell such material to minors, but provided that \n\n18 \n \nan honest mistake about age would excuse liability if the \nshopkeeper made a \u201creasonable bona fide attempt\u201d to as-\ncertain the customer\u2019s age. Id. at 631, 646. One obvious \nway to do so was by reviewing identification. See, e.g., \nLeading Cases: Freedom of Speech and Expression, 118 \nHarv. L. Rev. 353, 363 & n.85 (2004). \nConsidering a First Amendment challenge to the law, \nthe Court first concluded that a child\u2019s rights do not pre-\nvent States from defining obscenity based on its appeal \nto minors. Ginsberg, 390 U.S. at 637-39. The Court then \nidentified two interests to support the law: (1) parental \ninterests in deciding whether their children should view \nsuch material, and (2) the State\u2019s independent interest in \nthe well-being of children. Id. at 639-41. Because \u201cob-\nscenity is not protected expression,\u201d the Court required \nonly that New York have made a \u201crational\u201d decision that \nexposure to such material be harmful to minors. Id. at \n641-43. Concluding New York had, the Court rejected \nthe constitutional challenge. Id. \nSince deciding Ginsburg, the Court has reiterated its \nholdings many times. In Erznoznik v. City of Jackson-\nville, for example, the Court cited Ginsberg for the \u201cwell \nsettled\u201d proposition that governments \u201ccan adopt more \nstringent controls on communicative materials available \nto youths than on those available to adults.\u201d 422 U.S. 205, \n212 (1975). In Young v. American Mini Theatres, Inc., a \nplurality considering zoning rules for adult movie thea-\nters invoked Ginsberg to explain that \u201cthe Members of \nthe Court who would accord the greatest protection to \nsuch materials have repeatedly indicated that the State \ncould prohibit the distribution or exhibition of such ma-\nterials to juveniles and unconsenting adults.\u201d 427 U.S. \n50, 69 (1976) (plurality op.) And in Brown, the Court ex-\nplained\u2014without qualification\u2014that because \u201cobscenity \n\n19 \n \nis not protected expression,\u201d laws like that at issue in \nGinsberg that address obscenity for children need only \nbe rational. 564 U.S. at 794. \n2. The Court\u2019s decision in Sable makes explicit what \nwas already implicit in Ginsberg: Where the level of con-\nstitutional protection depends on the audience, States \nmay require the speaker to serve as the primary gate-\nkeeper to that audience. 492 U.S. at 125-26. The federal \nlaw at issue in Sable prohibited making, by way of an in-\nterstate telephone call, \u201cany obscene or indecent commu-\nnication for commercial purposes.\u201d Id. at 123 n.4. Sable \noperated \u201cdial-a-porn\u201d phone lines, offering prere-\ncorded, sexually explicit messages. Id. at 117-18. Uphold-\ning the ban on \u201cobscene\u201d phone calls, the Court explained \nthat the statute did not impose a national standard of ob-\nscenity but instead relied on \u201ccontemporary community \nstandards,\u201d as required by Miller. Id. at 124-25.   \nJudged by each individual community\u2019s standards, \nthe same recorded messages might be considered ob-\nscene (and therefore unprotected by the First Amend-\nment) in some communities but not obscene (and there-\nfore protected) in others. Id. at 125-26. Sable objected \nthat it was not its burden as speaker to distinguish be-\ntween those listeners. This Court disagreed, holding that \n\u201c[i]f Sable\u2019s audience is comprised of different communi-\nties with different local standards, Sable ultimately \nbears the burden of complying with the prohibition on \nobscene messages.\u201d Id. at 126. The Court recognized that \nSable might be \u201cforced to incur some costs\u201d to develop \nand implement its own \u201csystem\u201d to determine the locale \nof incoming calls but found \u201cno constitutional impedi-\nment\u201d to the imposition of such costs. Id. at 125.  \nThe principle from Sable is thus plain: Where a \nspeaker\u2019s audience consists of two groups\u2014one to whom \n\n20 \n \nthe speaker has the right to speak a particular message \nand another to whom the speaker does not\u2014the State \nmay place the onus on the speaker to distinguish be-\ntween the groups. See id. at 126. Such a rule makes \nsense. It is less invasive on speech when the speaker as-\nsesses his own listeners, rather than when the govern-\nment does so. Thus, even if distinguishing between lis-\nteners imposes costs, a State may require the speaker to \nserve as gatekeeper. See, e.g., Ashcroft v. ACLU (Ash-\ncroft I), 535 U.S. 564, 583 (2002) (plurality op.); see also \nid. at 582 (\u201cIn [Sable], this Court made no effort to eval-\nuate how burdensome it would have been for dial-a-porn \noperators to tailor their messages [because] the burden \nof complying with the statute rested with those compa-\nnies.\u201d). \n3. The Fifth Circuit thus correctly recognized that \nGinsberg controls this case: H.B. 1181 adjusts this \nCourt\u2019s definition of obscenity as it applies to minors, \nTex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code \u00a7129B.001(6); does not bar \nadult access to material that is obscene as to minors; is \nsupported by the same state interests as in Ginsberg that \nhave only grown more compelling; and is rationally re-\nlated to those interests (a point Petitioners do not con-\ntest).  \nTrue, one distinction between H.B. 1181 and the New \nYork law in Ginsberg is that H.B. 1181 makes age verifi-\ncation mandatory, id. \u00a7129B.002(a), while New York \nmade it an affirmative defense, Ginsberg, 390 U.S. at 646. \nBut this distinction is immaterial: Operationally, to avoid \ncriminal conviction, New York retailers that sold mate-\nrial considered obscene for minors had to ascertain the \nage of the person buying it\u2014an assessment that could be \nmade by looking at the person or by requesting other \nproof of age. And the other main distinction between the \n\n21 \n \nNew York law and this one cuts in favor of H.B. 1181. \nWhereas the New York law was a criminal provision that \ncarried with it the risk of one year in prison, id. at 633 \nn.2, H.B. 1181 is a civil provision. Ginsberg thus applies \na fortiori. \nIndeed, H.B. 1181 addresses a situation remarkably \nsimilar to Sable: speech that is obscene and therefore un-\nprotected for one community (children) but\u2014argua-\nbly4\u2014not obscene and therefore protected for another \ncommunity (adults). To be even more precise, H.B. 1181 \naddresses speech that is unprotected for minors in \nTexas. Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code \u00a7129B.001(6). Thus, \nPetitioners can comply with H.B. 1181 by leaving the \nState\u2014as Pornhub has done. William Melhado, Pornhub \nSuspends Site in Texas Due to State\u2019s Age-Verification \nLaw, \nTex. \nTribune \n(Mar. \n14, \n2024), \nhttps://perma.cc/N9K6-W7CL. But \u201c[i]f a publisher \nchooses to send its material\u201d to Texas, \u201cthis Court\u2019s ju-\nrisprudence teaches that it is the publisher\u2019s responsibil-\nity to abide by that community\u2019s standards.\u201d Ashcroft I, \n535 U.S. at 583 (plurality op.) (following Sable, 492 U.S. \nat 125-26).   \n4.  None of the forgoing analysis changes merely be-\ncause H.B. 1181 addresses the internet\u2014not magazine \nstands. First Amendment principles \u201cdo[] not change be-\ncause the [interaction] has gone from the physical to the \nvirtual world.\u201d NetChoice, 144 S.Ct. at 2393. The gate-\nkeeping function performed by the 1960s shopkeeper is \nnow performed by websites using age-verification tech-\nnology. Notably, Sable did not involve a brick-and-mor-\ntar building, but this Court nonetheless held that if a \n \n4 In reality, much of the content on Petitioners\u2019 websites is ob-\nscene even as to adults. See supra pp.4-5; infra p.43.  \n\n22 \n \ncompany in the speech business wishes to operate na-\ntionally, it must adjust its \u201csystem\u201d to ensure that every \naudience member in each community may lawfully hear \nits message. Sable, 492 U.S. at 125. As Sable confirms, it \nis constitutionally irrelevant that such adjustments may \nrequire the company itself to \u201cscreen[]\u201d would-be cus-\ntomers, contract with a third party to do it, or leave the \nmarket. Id. Nor did the imposition of such \u201cburdens\u201d \ntrigger strict scrutiny. Contra Pet.Br.32. \nIt would be odd\u2014to say the least\u2014for this Court to \n(1) permit States to require speakers to serve as gate-\nkeepers for their own audiences without any additional \nscrutiny, see Sable, 492 U.S. at 126; and (2) cite Ginsberg \nfor the rule that States need only have a rational basis to \nrestrict minors\u2019 access to pornography, e.g., Erznoznik, \n422 U.S. at 212; yet (3) impose strict scrutiny on a re-\nquirement that pornographers take reasonable steps to \nensure their audiences don\u2019t include children. In fact, \nsuch a doctrine would not just be odd\u2014it would be inco-\nherent.    \nB. Petitioners\u2019 theories are unpersuasive. \nPetitioners disagree, but their theories overlook \nprecedent, misread precedent, or miss the point. Re-\ngardless, if Ashcroft II means what Petitioners say, the \nCourt should overrule it because it would contradict \nother precedent and rest on untrue factual premises. \n1. In challenging the Fifth Circuit\u2019s application of \nthe rational-basis standard, Petitioners insist (e.g., at 24-\n27) that because H.B. 1181 is a \u201ccontent-based\u201d re-\nstriction on speech, it must trigger strict scrutiny. Both \nthe major and the minor premise are wrong. This Court \nhas \u201creject[ed] \u2026 the view that any examination of \nspeech or expression inherently\u201d makes a law content \nbased and \u201ctriggers heightened First Amendment \n\n23 \n \nconcern.\u201d City of Austin v. Reagan Nat\u2019l Advert. of Aus-\ntin, LLC, 596 U.S. 61, 73 (2022). Moreover, though the \nCourt has applied strict scrutiny to some content-based \nrestrictions, e.g., United States v. Playboy Entm\u2019t Grp., \nInc., 529 U.S. 803, 813 (2000), many laws that in one \nsense are \u201ccontent based\u201d are not subject to strict scru-\ntiny, see, e.g., FCC v. Pacifica Found., 438 U.S. 726, 745 \n(1978) (plurality op.).  \nHere, H.B. 1181 is not a content-based restriction on \nprotected speech. It is a requirement that speakers serve \nas the gatekeeper when their speech is unprotected as to \ncertain listeners. Under cases like Sable, such a require-\nment is entirely permissible. And because H.B. 1181 in-\nvolves protecting minors from exposure to hardcore por-\nnography, it is subject to rational-basis scrutiny. \na. Contrary to Petitioners\u2019 view, not every regula-\ntion of expression that turns in some sense on content is \nsubject to strict scrutiny. To the contrary, \u201c[t]he ques-\ntion whether speech is[] or is not protected by the First \nAmendment often depends on the content of the speech.\u201d \nNew York v. Ferber, 458 U.S. 747, 763 (1982) (quoting \nAm. Mini Theatres, 427 U.S. at 66 (plurality op.)). One \ncannot tell if speech is unprotected incitement, defama-\ntion, a true threat, or integral to a crime without consid-\nering its content. See, e.g., Stevens, 559 U.S. at 468-69. \nRegulations of commercial speech, Zauderer v. Office of \nDisciplinary Counsel of Sup. Ct. of Ohio, 471 U.S. 626, \n638 (1985), and bans against solicitation, Heffron v. Int\u2019l \nSoc. for Krishna Consciousness, Inc., 452 U.S. 640, 647 \n(1981), similarly turn on content. Applying these well-es-\ntablished principles, H.B. 1181 is not a regulation of pro-\ntected speech but a law controlling access by a particular \ncommunity to unprotected speech. \n\n24 \n \nBecause it has always been understood that the First \nAmendment allows \u201crestrictions upon the content of \nspeech\u201d in these limited areas, restrictions limited to \nthose areas are not subject to strict scrutiny. Counter-\nman, 600 U.S. at 73 (quoting Stevens, 559 U.S. at 468). \nH.B. 1181 addresses perhaps the prototypical example of \nsuch an area of unprotected expression: materials that \nare obscene for minors. See, e.g., Stevens, 559 U.S. at 468-\n69. Because H.B. 1181 does nothing more than create a \nmechanism to distinguish between minors and adults\u2019 \nability to access materials that are not protected as to \nminors, it cannot be subject to strict scrutiny.5 \nb. Obscenity, which the Court has described as \u201cval-\nueless material,\u201d Counterman, 600 U.S. at 73, is one cat-\negory of \u201cspeech\u201d that is \u201cnot protected,\u201d Smith v. Cali-\nfornia, 361 U.S. 147, 152 (1959). \u201cAt the time of the adop-\ntion of the First Amendment, obscenity law was not as \nfully developed as libel law, but there is sufficiently con-\ntemporaneous evidence to show that obscenity, too, was \noutside the protection intended for speech and press.\u201d \nRoth v. United States, 354 U.S. 476, 483 & n.13 (1957); \nsee also id. at 485 n.17 (listing federal obscenity laws). \nAccordingly, the regulation or prohibition of obscenity is \nnot subject to strict scrutiny, even though one has to see \nit to know it. See, e.g., Hamling v. United States, 418 U.S. \n87 (1974) (criminalizing obscenity). Even the dissenters \nin Reagan agreed that governments may prohibit ob-\nscenity\u2014a \n\u201ccontent-based \nrestriction[]\u201d\u2014without \n \n5 Petitioners spill considerable ink (at 16-19) defending speech \nthat is (allegedly) not obscene as to minors or adults. It is unclear, \nhowever, how much of that speech Petitioners make. Because the \npreliminary-injunction record does not answer that question, this \npoint cannot support their facial challenge. See NetChoice, 144 S.Ct. \nat 2398-99. \n\n25 \n \nmeeting strict scrutiny. 596 U.S. at 87 n.1 (Thomas, J., \ndissenting). \nThis rule does not change merely because the line \nhere concerns obscenity for minors. Speech is generally \nconsidered obscene if the \u201caverage person, applying con-\ntemporary community standards,\u201d would conclude that \n\u201cthe work, taken as a whole, appeals to the prurient in-\nterest.\u201d Miller, 413 U.S. at 24. In determining whether a \ndepiction is or \u201cis not protected expression,\u201d govern-\nments can consider whether the audience comprises \nadults or children. Brown, 564 U.S. at 794 (discussing \nGinsberg). Accordingly, the fact that H.B. 1181 requires \nconsidering the content of speech to determine whether \nit is protected by the First Amendment as to minors does \nnot require the application of strict scrutiny. \n2. In arguing to the contrary, Petitioners point (at \n21-23) to Ashcroft II, Sable, Playboy, and Reno for the \nproposition that strict scrutiny applies to alleged bur-\ndens on adult access to speech even if that same speech \nis unprotected for minors. These cases, however, are in-\napposite because each involved a law that banned pro-\ntected speech for all listeners\u2014not, as H.B. 1181 does, \nrequire the speaker to serve as the gatekeeper to ensure \nthose individuals who have a constitutional right to do so \n(and only those individuals) can access the material. \na. The Fifth Circuit concluded that the Child Online \nProtection Act (COPA) at issue in Ashcroft II is the clos-\nest analog to H.B. 1181. Pet.App.16a. Like H.B. 1181, \nCOPA defined material that was \u201charmful to minors\u201d us-\ning the Miller standard. 542 U.S. at 661. But, unlike H.B. \n1181, COPA criminalized posting such information to the \ninternet for \u201ccommercial purposes.\u201d Id. COPA involved \nage verification in some sense, but only as an affirmative \ndefense: A criminal defendant could avoid liability by \n\n26 \n \nrestricting access to obscene-for-minors material by re-\nquiring, among other things, a credit card, adult access \ncode, digital age certificate, or measures feasible under \nexisting technology. Id. at 662.  \nAshcroft II is irrelevant here for at least three rea-\nsons.  \nFirst, COPA placed a greater burden on speech than \nH.B. 1181. It was a criminal statute that used age verifi-\ncation only as a defense, so there was no guarantee \nagainst prosecution. See, e.g., Ashcroft II, 542 U.S. at 674 \n(Stevens, J., concurring). Criminal statutes often require \ngreater scrutiny. See, e.g., City of Houston v. Hill, 482 \nU.S. 451, 459 (1987). By contrast, H.B. 1181 is a civil stat-\nute and so is not \u201cenforced by severe criminal penalties.\u201d \nAshcroft II, 542 U.S. at 660.   \nSecond, the Court did not purport to overrule Sable \nor to limit Ginsberg to brick-and-mortar shopping. In-\nstead, the Court barely addressed either case, and never \nmentioned the relevant portion of Sable addressing when \ngovernments can require speakers to act as gatekeepers. \nThe Court does not lightly toss aside foundational legal \nprinciples (as opposed to fact-heavy analysis), and cer-\ntainly did not do it without saying so. Further, the Court \nrecognized that the 5-year-old record did not \u201creflect \ncurrently technological reality.\u201d Id. at 671. Accordingly, \nfor case-specific reasons, age verification was seen as a \nmaterial burden rather than a manageable gatekeeping \nobligation. Here, by contrast, because of technological \nadvances, it is now far easier and less invasive to age ver-\nify; in fact, it can be done via software that does not even \nretain facial images. J.A.190-91. \nThird, as the Fifth Circuit explained, no one con-\ntested strict scrutiny\u2019s application in Ashcroft II. This \nCourt\u2019s rule \u201cin both civil and criminal cases\u201d is to \u201crely \n\n27 \n \non the parties to frame the issues for decision and assign \nto courts the role of neutral arbiter of matters the parties \npresent.\u201d Greenlaw v. United States, 554 U.S. 237, 243 \n(2008). In fact, \u201cour system is designed around the prem-\nise that parties represented by competent counsel know \nwhat is best for them, and are responsible for advancing \nthe facts and arguments entitling them to relief.\u201d United \nStates v. Sineneng-Smith, 590 U.S. 371, 375-76 (2020) \n(cleaned up). Because the government did not argue for \na lesser burden, the Court was not obligated to make an \nargument for it. Pet.App.19a. \nc. None of Petitioners\u2019 other three cases establish \nthat H.B. 1181 is subject to strict scrutiny.  \nFirst, Petitioners\u2019 reliance on Sable (at 21) is selec-\ntive. As explained above, Sable\u2019s gatekeeping analysis\u2014\nwhich Petitioners do not address\u2014squarely supports \nH.B. 1181. The Court in Sable also upheld an outright \nban on \u201cobscene\u201d telephone calls because \u201cprotection of \nthe First Amendment does not extend to obscene \nspeech.\u201d 492 U.S. at 124. Granted, the Court applied \nstrict scrutiny to the ban on \u201cindecent\u201d communications, \nnoting that \u201c[s]exual expression which is indecent but not \nobscene is protected by the First Amendment.\u201d Id. at \n126. Although the government attempted to justify the \ncomplete ban on indecent calls as necessary to protect \nminors, the Court recognized that other means were \navailable to vindicate that interest\u2014namely, requiring \nSable to screen its customers. Id. at 128. As that is what \nH.B. 1181 requires covered websites to do, it is hard to \nsee how Sable helps Petitioners. \nSecond, Playboy concerned what amounted to a ban \non speech that was not obscene. The Telecommunica-\ntions Act of 1996 required cable operators who provided \nchannels \u201cprimarily dedicated to sexually-oriented \n\n28 \n \nprogramming\u201d to scramble those channels or limit their \ntransmission to nighttime hours. 529 U.S. at 806. Rele-\nvant here, it was undisputed that the material at issue \nwas not obscene, and therefore that the law was a con-\ntent-based restriction on protected speech. Id. at 811-12. \nBecause scrambling was not guaranteed to be effective \ndue to signal bleed, most operators were effectively \nforced not to transmit such speech outside of nighttime \nhours. Id. at 806-07. This, in turn, prevented adults from \nviewing such materials for two-thirds of the day. Id. at \n812. Because the statute prohibited adults from viewing \nconstitutionally protected speech, this Court held it was \nsubject to strict scrutiny. Id. at 813. The Court did not \naddress whether the content at issue constituted obscen-\nity for children, let alone what the analysis would be for \na law that limited only children\u2019s right to access such ma-\nterials during daylight hours. \nThird, Reno concerned the Communications Decency \nAct (CDA), the \u201cbreadth\u201d of which was \u201cwholly unprece-\ndented.\u201d 521 U.S. at 877. The CDA criminalized the \nonline transmission of \u201cany comment, request, sugges-\ntion, proposal, image, or other communication which is \nobscene or indecent\u201d to someone known to be a minor. \nId. at 859 (emphasis added). In defining affected mate-\nrial, the CDA also prohibited \u201cpatently offensive\u201d com-\nmunications involving sexual activities and organs but \ndid not fully parrot the Court\u2019s obscenity precedent. Id. \nat 860. Thus, the CDA applied to far more speech than \nobscenity for minors. Further, because it applied \n\u201cbroadly to the entire universe of cyberspace,\u201d id. at 868, \nanyone posting had to assume a minor was present and \n\u201cin the absence of a viable age verification process\u201d cen-\nsor their speech accordingly, id. at 876.  \n\n29 \n \nTo the extent that Reno is relevant at all, it rebuts \nPetitioners\u2019 attempt to cabin Ginsberg (at 20-21, 30-31) \nas holding only that a State may define obscenity with \nrespect to minors. If that were true, Reno would have \nbeen much shorter. The Court would not have needed to \ndistinguish the CDA from the New York law in Ginsberg \nin at least four respects: the CDA (1) did not allow par-\nents to consent to the speech, (2) applied to non-commer-\ncial transactions, (3) used a much broader definition of \ncovered content, and (4) defined minors as those under \n18. 521 U.S. at 865-66. Instead, the Court could have \nsimply said Ginsberg answered a different question.  \nThe Fifth Circuit properly noted that at least three \nof the distinctions identified in Reno are inapplicable to \nH.B. 1181. Pet.App.13a-15a. Under H.B. 1181, so long as \nparents age verify themselves, they may allow their chil-\ndren to view any material on covered websites. See Tex. \nCiv. Prac. & Rem. Code \u00a7129B.002. H.B. 1181 applies \nonly to commercial entities whose websites contain more \nthan one-third harmful material. Id. \u00a7129B.002(a). H.B. \n1181 also closely follows the Court\u2019s definition of obscen-\nity. Id. \u00a7129B.001(6). And while H.B. 1181 defines minor \nas an individual under 18 rather than 17, id. \n\u00a7129B.001(3), that is a distinction without a difference \nhere, especially for a facial challenge. Thus, just as the \nReno Court distinguished the New York law in Ginsberg \nfrom the CDA, this Court should distinguish H.B. 1181 \nfrom the CDA. \nC. If Ashcroft II requires strict scrutiny, it \nshould be overruled. \nTexas does not believe that Ashcroft II requires ap-\nplication of strict scrutiny here. If the Court disagrees, \nhowever, so much the worse for Ashcroft II. Under Peti-\ntioners\u2019 theory, Ashcroft II ran roughshod over Sable \n\n30 \n \nand Ginsberg while creating an untenable distinction be-\ntween cyberspace and brick-and-mortar commerce\u2014\nsomething this Court refused to do in NetChoice. Doctri-\nnally, it makes no sense that a State can require an of-\nfline merchant to verify that a customer is not a child\u2014\u00e0 \nla Ginsberg\u2014but cannot do the same for an online mer-\nchant. After all, the same sort of (supposed) chill exists \nin either forum. E.g., Pet.App.11a (noting Petitioners\u2019 \nadmission). Yet this Court in Ginsberg and Sable allowed \nStates to place the burden on the speaker. \nFurthermore, the facts have changed markedly since \n2004\u2014a key reason to overrule precedent. See, e.g., Ja-\nnus v. Am. Fed\u2019n of State, Cnty., & Mun. Emps., Council \n31, 585 U.S. 878, 924-25 (2018). Although the federal gov-\nernment\u2019s decision not to challenge strict scrutiny in \nAshcroft II may seem strange in retrospect, given the in-\nfancy of the internet and the rudimentary technologies \nat issue, no one then credibly could have claimed that \nage-verification technology reliably and easily distin-\nguished adults from minors. Furthermore, online ob-\nscenity has grown much more dangerous for kids as the \nvolume, production quality, and algorithm usage in-\ncreases\u2014and will grow even more dangerous as AI be-\ncomes more entrenched. The world has changed.  \nII. H.B. 1181 Survives Any Level of Review. \nPetitioners do not argue that H.B. 1181 fails rational-\nbasis review, instead focusing on strict scrutiny. Even if \nheightened scrutiny applied, however, H.B. 1181 would \nclear it. At most, the standard would be intermediate \nscrutiny, but even under strict scrutiny, Texas has a com-\npelling interest and H.B. 1181 appropriately vindicates \nthat interest. Because \u201c[t]his Court \u2026 does not review \nlower courts\u2019 opinions, but their judgments,\u201d Jennings v. \n\n31 \n \nStephens, 574 U.S. 271, 277 (2015), the Court can affirm \non these bases as well.   \nA. At most, intermediate scrutiny applies. \n1. If the Court concludes that the Ginsberg/Sable \nrule does not govern, H.B. 1181 should be subject, at \nmost, to intermediate scrutiny. For decades, this Court \nhas recognized that States may protect children by cre-\nating adult-only spaces. After all, \u201c[t]he ease with which \nchildren may obtain access to broadcast material, cou-\npled with the concerns recognized in Ginsberg, amply \njustify special treatment of indecent broadcasting.\u201d \nPacifica, 438 U.S. at 750. As the internet further eases\u2014\nexponentially\u2014children\u2019s access to even more harmful \nvariations of such material, that rationale applies with \neven greater force. \nSimilar analysis is found in the Court\u2019s secondary-ef-\nfects doctrine. In City of Renton v. Playtime Theatres, \nInc., for example, the Court examined a zoning ordinance \nprohibiting adult theaters within 1,000 feet of residential \nzones, family dwellings, churches, parks, or schools. 475 \nU.S. 41, 54 (1986) (quoting Am. Mini Theatres, 427 U.S. \nat 71 (plurality op.)). Like other laws of its kind, applica-\ntion of the ordinance turned (at least in part) on the con-\ntent of the films. Id. at 47. Nevertheless, the Court con-\ncluded that the ordinance was not \u201caimed\u201d at that \u201ccon-\ntent\u201d but \u201crather at the secondary effects of such thea-\nters on the surrounding community.\u201d Id. (emphasis in \noriginal). Because the ordinance was \u201cjustified without \nreference to the content of the regulated speech,\u201d it was \ndeemed \u201ccontent-neutral.\u201d Id. at 48. Thus, the Court \nheld, it was constitutional as long as it was \u201cdesigned to \nserve a substantial governmental interest and allow[ed] \nfor reasonable alternative avenues of communication.\u201d \nId. at 50.  \n\n32 \n \n2. As Justice O\u2019Connor explained in Reno, efforts to \nregulate children\u2019s access to online pornography are best \nunderstood as attempts to translate Renton to cyber-\nspace. 521 U.S. at 889 (O\u2019Connor, J., concurring in part). \nDoing so was infeasible at the time because the internet \nof the 1990s lacked the two characteristics necessary \u201cto \ncreate \u2018adult zones\u2019\u201d: the power to sort by \u201cgeography \nand identity.\u201d Id. (citing Lawrence Lessig, Reading the \nConstitution in Cyberspace, 45 Emory L.J. 869, 886 \n(1996)). That is, \u201c[a] minor can see an adult dance show \nonly if he enters an establishment that provides such en-\ntertainment,\u201d yet that would be all but impossible to do \nbecause he could not \u201cconceal completely his identity (or, \nconsequently, his age).\u201d Id. Due to technological con-\nstraints, the same could not be said of the internet of the \n1990s and early 2000s. Id. \nBut the internet has fundamentally changed. It is \nnow possible \u201cto exclude persons from accessing certain \nmessages on the basis of their identity\u201d and to treat dif-\nferent jurisdictions differently. Id. at 890. Even apart \nfrom H.B. 1181, many websites use platforms like Yoti to \nage verify individuals. J.A.181. Websites can also distin-\nguish users by geography: Pornhub left the Texas mar-\nket after the Fifth Circuit stayed the district court\u2019s in-\njunction. Melhado, supra. And a host of websites age ver-\nify in jurisdictions all around the world. These facts \ndemonstrate that it is now possible to distinguish adults \nfrom minors and between physical locations online, mak-\ning Renton directly analogous. \n3. Petitioners do not dispute that H.B. 1181 serves a \nsubstantial\u2014indeed, compelling\u2014interest. Accordingly, \nbecause \u201creasonable alternative avenues of communica-\ntion\u201d remain open to Petitioners, Renton, 475 U.S. at 50, \nit follows that H.B. 1181 survives intermediate scrutiny. \n\n33 \n \nA restriction on videos of \u201cteen bondage gangbang[s],\u201d \nJ.A.176, does not \u201cinvade[] the area of freedom of expres-\nsion constitutionally secured to minors,\u201d Ginsberg, 390 \nU.S. at 637. And whether or not such materials can be \ndeemed \u201cartistic, informative, or even essential to im-\nportant parts of career and life,\u201d Pet.Br.1, Petitioners \nare free to produce, publish, and profit from as much of \nthem as the adult market can bear. Accordingly, their \nargument (at 35) that the Fifth Circuit erred in distin-\nguishing between outright bans on speech and burdens \nhas no place in the secondary-effects analysis. \nH.B. 1181 also does not discriminate against speech; \ninstead, content is considered for the sole purpose of de-\ntermining whether it is unprotected speech as to minors. \nH.B. 1181 is thus content neutral for the same reasons \nproducers of materials depicting \u201cactual sexually explicit \nconduct\u201d can be required to maintain records of their \nperformers\u2019 identities and ages to comply with a law de-\nsigned to prevent child pornography. Connection Dis-\ntrib. Co. v. Holder, 557 F.3d 321, 325, 328-29 (6th Cir. \n2009) (en banc).  \n4. Petitioners reject that intermediate scrutiny may \napply based on their misreading of Ashcroft II\u2014rebut-\nted above\u2014and separately (at 34-37) because H.B. 1181 \nsupposedly \u201cembodies speaker-based discrimination.\u201d \nThis latter argument reflects confusion. \nSpeaker-based distinctions are not inherently sus-\npect. For example, laws prohibiting speech integral to \ncriminal conduct do not unconstitutionally discriminate \nagainst would-be criminals because of the message they \nwish to convey. See, e.g., Giboney v. Empire Storage & \nIce Co., 336 U.S. 490, 498 (1949). And Petitioners\u2019 sug-\ngestion (at 35) that counsel for Texas\u2019s accurate charac-\nterization of their products means that legislation \n\n34 \n \nenacted by a different branch of government is subject \nto strict-scrutiny review is bewildering. Petitioners do \nnot dispute that content on their websites constitutes ob-\nscenity for children. Indeed, much of that content is also \nobscene for adults. See, e.g., supra pp.4-5; infra p.43. \nFurthermore, speaker-based discrimination impli-\ncates constitutional concerns only when the government \nuses it as a proxy for viewpoint-based discrimination. See \nR.A.V. v. City of St. Paul, 505 U.S. 377, 384 (1992). Laws \nsuch as H.B. 1181 regulating those who would otherwise \nspeak harmful and unprotected obscenity to minors do \nnot discriminate based on the speaker, but based on \nwhether the speech is protected in the first place.  \nPetitioners posit (at 35) that Texas\u2019s decision to ex-\nempt search engines or websites with less than one-third \nharmful content means the State has discriminated \nagainst the pornography industry. This is wrong for at \nleast four reasons.  \nFirst, Petitioners misunderstand Texas law: Search \nengines are exempt only to the extent they \u201cprovid[e] ac-\ncess or connection to or from\u201d a website that is not under \ntheir control. Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code \u00a7129B.005. If \na search engine operates\u2014or controls an entity that op-\nerates\u2014a website subject to H.B. 1181, it would no \nlonger be exempt. Id. Likewise and contrary to Petition-\ners\u2019 claim (at 35), social-media companies are not exempt \nfrom H.B. 1181 but must comply with it if they reach the \none-third threshold. Id. \u00a7129B.002(a).  \nSecond, Petitioners presume both that the subjective \nmotivation of a legislator is relevant to the constitutional \ninquiry and that such motivation can be determined \nwithout evidence. Both presumptions are mistaken. The \nburden of showing an improper legislative motive is a \n\u201cdemanding one,\u201d Easley v. Cromartie, 532 U.S. 234, 241 \n\n35 \n \n(2001), and \u201cthis Court will not strike down an otherwise \nconstitutional statute on the basis of an alleged illicit leg-\nislative motive,\u201d United States v. O\u2019Brien, 391 U.S. 367, \n383 (1968). \nThird, the Court has already held that governments \ncannot address the epidemic of online pornography\u2019s ef-\nfect on children by \u201cbroadly\u201d regulating \u201cthe entire uni-\nverse of cyberspace.\u201d Reno, 521 U.S. at 868. Given that \nholding, Texas\u2019s choice to regulate only those in the busi-\nness of distributing online obscenity is an effort to com-\nply with precedent\u2014not disregard it. Contra Pet.Br.28. \nIt is instead Petitioners who seek to evade precedent by \nexpanding the law of content- or speaker-based discrim-\nination such that it would render all laws governing un-\nprotected speech subject to strict scrutiny. \nFourth, Petitioners are wrong (at 36) that H.B. 1181\u2019s \nexemptions \u201cdefeat[] the law\u2019s avowed purpose.\u201d This ar-\ngument boils down to the view that H.B. 1181 is underin-\nclusive. Yet underinclusiveness is not fatal, else govern-\nments could only regulate in \u201cone fell swoop\u201d or not at \nall. Williams-Yulee, 575 U.S. at 449. Regardless, the idea \nthat a search engine is the same as Pornhub defies cre-\ndulity; Google has not embedded an addictive algorithm \nin its search function. Compare Adler, supra, at 811. And \na State surely can treat websites centered\u2014like a hub\u2014\naround pornography differently than those in which such \ncontent may appear but is hardly the focal point.  \nB. H.B. 1181 also survives strict scrutiny.  \nUltimately, the standard-of-scrutiny question is aca-\ndemic because H.B. 1181 satisfies even strict scrutiny.  \n1. H.B. 1181 serves a critical state interest. The \nCourt said as much in Sable and Petitioners do not con-\ntend otherwise. Rather, they concede (at 3) that Texas \nhas a compelling interest in the well-being of its children \n\n36 \n \nthat would permit regulation of Petitioners\u2019 speech even \nif subjected to strict scrutiny. For good reason. As this \nCourt recognized in Ginsberg, Texas has an independent \ninterest\u2014separate from that of a child\u2019s parents\u2014in the \nwell-being of the children within the State. 390 U.S. at \n640. And as the Fifth Circuit discussed, \u201cthe record is re-\nplete with examples of the sort of damage that access to \npornography does to children.\u201d Pet.App.26a.  \nEven in this preliminary stage of litigation, Texas of-\nfered evidence showing that children exposed to pornog-\nraphy exhibit \u201ca host of mental health afflictions\u201d includ-\ning depression, disassociation, and other behavioral \nproblems such as dating violence, emulating sexual \nstrangulation, and sexual coercion. J.A.160. They are \nalso more likely to use tobacco, alcohol, and drugs. \nJ.A.161. And as the Fifth Circuit observed, exposure to \npornography correlates with an increased likelihood chil-\ndren will view bestiality or child pornography. \nPet.App.26a. It is not by accident that nations all around \nthe world\u2014holding divergent views on a host of social \nconcerns\u2014agree that children should be not exposed to \nhardcore pornography.  \n \n2. H.B. 1181 is also narrowly tailored to the realities \nof today\u2019s increasingly digital world, where the dangers \nof unmonitored and surreptitious internet access by chil-\ndren is omnipresent. See, e.g., supra pp.8-9. In 1997, chil-\ndren could go online only at home or in a crowded venue \nsuch as a classroom or public library. Not so today. In-\nstead, \u201c53% of children have a smartphone by age 11,\u201d \nand \u201cover 95% of teens ages 13 to 17 years hav[e] access \nto a cell phone.\u201d Aliah Richter, et al., Youth Perspectives \non the Recommended Age of Mobile Phone Adoption: \nSurvey Study, 5(4) JMIR Pediatrics & Parenting 1 \n(2022). Even Amish communities worry about online \n\n37 \n \npornography. See, e.g., Kevin Granville & Ashley Gil-\nbertson, In Amish Country, the Future Is Calling, N.Y. \nTimes (Sept. 15, 2017), https://tinyurl.com/amishtimes. \nH.B. 1181 also is not \u201ca wholesale prohibition upon \nadult access to indecent speech.\u201d Sable, 492 U.S. at 132 \n(Scalia, J., concurring). Rather, it protects children from \nthat which is obscene by their standards, by requiring \nthe purveyors to check whether their viewers are chil-\ndren\u2014leaving adults able to access pornography by en-\ngaging in a process that they must complete potentially \nonly once and that applies equally to viewing pornogra-\nphy, buying wine, or renting a car. Supra pp.9-10. Alt-\nhough this requirement may impose a limited (if not de \nminimis) financial burden on Petitioners, they can decide \nhow to minimize that burden by choosing to contract for \nor handle verification themselves. Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. \nCode \u00a7129B.003; accord Sable, 492 U.S. at 125-26.  \n3. H.B. 1181 is also the least restrictive means to vin-\ndicate Texas\u2019s compelling interest. Because Texas may \nprotect children from exposure to obscenity, \u201cit neces-\nsarily follows that there must be a constitutional means \nof carrying it out.\u201d Glossip v. Gross, 576 U.S. 863, 869 \n(2015) (cleaned up). Requiring a speaker to check its own \ncustomers\u2019 ages is an appropriate means. Indeed, it is \ndifficult to see a better one. The nation has tried the al-\nternative\u2014content filtering\u2014for twenty years. It has \nnot worked. Texas thus may do the same thing that ju-\nrisdictions around the world are already doing.  \nNor is it a secret why content filtering fails. Filters \nonly work if they are consistently applied, but given the \nubiquity of internet-enabled computers, tablets, phones, \nwatches and even eyeglasses, consistent application is an \nimpossibility. A single child with an unfiltered device can \nexpose all his friends to the vilest obscenity, no matter \n\n38 \n \nthe content-filtering vigilance of other parents. In other \nwords, in a world where internet access is limited to \nclassrooms, libraries, and living rooms, it may be possi-\nble to rely on filters. But as jurisdictions around the \nglobe recognize, that hasn\u2019t been reality for years.      \nC. Petitioners\u2019 response fails.  \nPetitioners offer several contrary arguments, none of \nwhich is persuasive. \n \n1.  To start, Petitioners complain (at 38) that H.B. \n1181 is overinclusive because it applies to \u201can entire web-\nsite\u201d even if only one-third of the material is harmful. But \nif otherwise covered websites were to rigidly segregate \nobscene material, H.B. 1181 presumably would not ap-\nply.6 Like this Court, the Texas Supreme Court con-\nstrues statutes to avoid constitutional concerns. E.g., Os-\nterberg v. Peca, 12 S.W.3d 31, 51 (Tex. 2000). And it is \ncertainly possible to construe H.B. 1181 to allow entities \nto subdivide their content in such a way that no age ver-\nification would be required for a child-friendly website. \nBecause this is a pre-enforcement challenge, however, no \nstate court has had the opportunity to answer this ques-\ntion. Regardless, Petitioners have not attempted to \nprove that they, much less a substantial number of such \nwebsites, categorize their offerings that way. See infra \nPart III. \n2. Shifting gears, Petitioners also say (at 38-39) that \nH.B. 1181 is underinclusive because it is limited to web-\nsites that host a substantial amount of obscenity rather \n \n6 Petitioners\u2019 movie example (at 38) illustrates the point. If no \none makes sure that ticket buyers actually go only to their assigned \nscreen and stay there, a State absolutely could forbid a theater \nshowing hardcore obscenity on some screens from selling tickets to \n12-year-olds.   \n\n39 \n \nthan every website with such material. Putting aside the \n\u201csomewhat counterintuitive\u201d nature of arguing that H.B. \n1181 violates the First Amendment by failing to regulate \nmore speakers, \u201cthe First Amendment imposes no free-\nstanding \u2018underinclusiveness limitation.\u2019\u201d Williams-\nYulee, 575 U.S. at 449 (quoting R.A.V., 505 U.S. at 387). \nTexas thus \u201cneed not address all aspects of [the] problem \nin one fell swoop\u201d but instead \u201cmay focus on their most \npressing concerns.\u201d Id. Underinclusiveness is problem-\natic only when it serves as a proxy for viewpoint discrim-\nination. Id. Texas, however, has drawn reasonable\u2014and \nlong permitted\u2014lines.  \nOf course, Texas could have chosen to lower the \u201csex-\nual material harmful to minors\u201d content threshold from \none third of a commercial website\u2019s content, but doing so \nwould increase the burden on online speech, bringing it \ncloser to what was held unconstitutional in Reno, 521 \nU.S. at 877-78. Instead, H.B. 1181 applies to websites de-\nvoted to providing access to pornography. In the words \nof Williams-Yulee, 575 U.S. at 449, H.B. 1181 \u201caims \nsquarely at the conduct most likely to undermine\u201d the \nhealth of underage Texans: pornographic websites like \nthose run by the Petitioners. Applying Petitioners\u2019 logic, \nTexas would have to regulate either the entire internet, \nor none of it. But \u201c[t]he First Amendment does not put a \nState to that all-or-nothing choice.\u201d Id. at 452. This Court \nshould \u201cnot punish [Texas] for leaving open more, rather \nthan fewer, avenues of expression.\u201d Id.  \n3. Similarly without merit are Petitioners\u2019 conten-\ntions (at 39-41) that H.B. 1181 fails to use the least re-\nstrictive means. Petitioners insist (at 40-41) that because \nthis Court has stated a preference for content filtering \nover the primitive age-verification technologies in the \n1990s, Texas is forever limited to cajoling parents into \n\n40 \n \nusing filtering or requiring companies that provide inter-\nnet-enabled devices to employ it. Indeed, Petitioners \nlargely give up the game when they say (at 41 n.6) that \nthe States can require device manufacturers and inter-\nnet service providers to age verify, which would block at \nleast the same amount of content if not more. It is thus \nfar from clear that such filtering is less restrictive given \nit could lead to restriction of more content. At the very \nleast, Petitioners have failed to offer sufficient evidence \nto succeed on this ground facially. Infra Part III.  \nAssuming for argument\u2019s sake that content filtering \nis less restrictive, however, that does not answer the \nquestion. Content filtering has existed for decades, yet \nthe problem targeted by H.B. 1181\u2014childhood exposure \nto obscenity\u2014has gotten much worse. \u201cIt is always true, \nby definition, that the status quo is less restrictive than \na new regulatory law.\u201d Ashcroft II, 542 U.S. at 684 \n(Breyer, J., dissenting)). That is why the least-alterna-\ntive-means analysis requires the proposed alternative to \nbe \u201cat least as effective\u201d as the challenged provision. \nReno, 521 U.S. at 874 (emphasis added). As even the min-\nimal evidence available at this early stage confirms, de-\nspite its wide availability for decades, content filtering \n\u201chas proven an ineffective mechanism\u201d to limit \u201cexpo-\nsure to adult content by minors.\u201d J.A.207.  \nLeaning\u2014tellingly\u2014on an amicus brief, Petitioners \n(at 41) also raise the specter of Virtual Private Networks \n(VPNs). Petitioners point to the contention that \u201ctwenty \npercent of females and thirty-two percent of males be-\ntween the ages of sixteen and twenty-four\u201d use VPNs. \nICMEC.Cert.Br.12-13.7 That claim has not been tested \n \n7 Petitioners did not raise this statistic below, let alone address \nwhether VPN usage was predominantly by those between the ages \n \n\n41 \n \nin discovery, including whether such use is constant or \nsporadic. Even assuming it is true, however, that VPNs \nare used by young adults, that only undercuts Petition-\ners\u2019 argument that H.B. 1181 will do nothing to prevent \nchildren from being exposed to hardcore pornography. \nPre-pubescent children, for example, are particularly \ndrawn to hentai\u2014and there is no evidence they have ac-\ncess to VPNs. Regardless, even if an unknown percent-\nage of older minors (as opposed to young adults) in Texas \nconsistently use VPNs, amici\u2019s numbers suggest that \napproximately 70-80% or more may not be using VPNs. \nThat would powerfully recommend H.B. 1181\u2019s value in \nadvancing Texas\u2019s interest in protecting kids.  \n4. Petitioners and the district court also are wrong \nthat H.B. 1181 should be deemed something other than \nthe least restrictive means based on \u201cprivacy\u201d concerns. \nSpecifically, the district court worried \u201cthe state govern-\nment can log and track\u201d pornography access by imple-\nmenting age verification, Pet.App.125a, and Petitioners \necho that concern here (at 8-9). Nothing could be further \nfrom the truth. H.B. 1181 does not require adult pornog-\nraphy viewers to \u201caffirmatively identify themselves.\u201d \nPet.App.125a (emphasis added). Instead, they must only \ncorroborate their age through a method selected by Pe-\ntitioners. Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code \u00a7\u00a7129B.002-.003. \nAnd far from using age verification to track anyone, \nTexas has made the practice illegal. Id. \u00a7129B.002(b). \nH.B. 1181 thus does not require any record of the \u201cmost \nintimate and personal aspects of people\u2019s lives\u201d at which \nthe government could \u201cpeer,\u201d Pet.App.125a\u2014even if \nTexas wanted to (which it doesn\u2019t).     \n \nof 18 and 24. This argument thus is nowhere addressed in the Fifth \nCircuit\u2019s decision. \n\n42 \n \nIn sum, \u201c[t]he traditional power of government to fos-\nter good morals,\u201d especially those of kids, \u201cha[s] not been \nrepealed by the First Amendment.\u201d City of Erie v. Pap\u2019s \nA.M., 529 U.S. 277, 310 (2000) (Scalia, J., concurring). \nH.B. 1181 is Texas\u2019s attempt to protect children from ob-\nscenity without depriving adults of the choice to view \nsuch material. This Court \u201cshould not hastily dismiss the \njudgment of legislators, who may be in a better position \n\u2026 to assess the implications of new technology.\u201d Brown, \n564 U.S. at 806 (Alito, J., concurring). \nIII. H.B. 1181 is Not Facially Unconstitutional. \nEven putting aside the forgoing, the district court\u2019s \nanalysis of this facial challenge cannot possibly be rec-\nonciled with NetChoice.  \nA. Petitioners are not entitled to facial relief. \n1. As the Court explained in NetChoice, facial chal-\nlenges \u201ccome[] at a cost.\u201d 144 S.Ct. at 2397. Not only \nmust courts consider whether \u201cheartland\u201d applications \nare unconstitutional, but also whether \u201ca substantial \nnumber\u201d of the whole universe of \u201capplications are un-\nconstitutional, judged in relation to the statute\u2019s plainly \nlegitimate sweep.\u201d Id. In other words, plaintiffs must \nshow that \u201ca law\u2019s unconstitutional applications\u201d are \n\u201csubstantially disproportionate.\u201d United States v. Han-\nsen, 599 U.S. 762, 770 (2023). Absent a \u201clopsided ratio,\u201d \n\u201ccourts must handle unconstitutional applications as \nthey usually do\u2014case-by-case.\u201d Id.  \nThe Court reiterated this analysis in United States v. \nRahimi. Rather than focusing on \u201cthe circumstances in \nwhich\u201d a law \u201cwas most likely to be constitutional,\u201d the \nlower court \u201cfocused on hypothetical scenarios where [it] \nmight raise constitutional concerns.\u201d 144 S.Ct. 1889, 1903 \n(2024). But that was \u201cslaying a straw man.\u201d Id. Although \n\n43 \n \nRahimi arose in the Second rather than First Amend-\nment context, the Court\u2019s rejection of \u201chypothetical\u201d sce-\nnarios is also a familiar feature of First Amendment law. \nSee, e.g., Hansen, 599 U.S. at 786 (Thomas, J., concur-\nring) (citing Broadrick, 413 U.S. at 610-11).    \n2. Here, the district court\u2019s facial analysis is defi-\ncient in numerous respects.  \nFirst, the preliminary-injunction record does not re-\nflect how much of the material on Petitioners\u2019 websites is \nalso obscene for adults. As demonstrated above, see su-\npra pp.4-5, the answer to this question is \u201ca lot.\u201d Because \na substantial portion of the content is obscene, it receives \nno First Amendment protection\u2014no matter who is look-\ning. See Counterman, 600 U.S. at 73. If graphic displays \nof \u201cmouth spreaders,\u201d J.A.176, and much else besides, do \nnot satisfy the Miller standard, nothing does.   \nThe district court refused to consider such content (of \nwhich there are petabytes), instead focusing on media \nlike Netflix films. ROA.1877-81. In so doing, it failed \nNetChoice two times over. Not only did it fail to consider \nthe whole universe of applications, but it did not even \nconsider those applications within H.B. 1181\u2019s heartland.  \nSecond, \u201c[t]o justify facial invalidation, a law\u2019s uncon-\nstitutional applications must be realistic, not fanciful.\u201d \nHansen, 599 U.S. at 770. Rather than providing specific \nreal-world examples, however, Petitioners imagine (at \n38) a website in which 35% of the content is harmful to \nminors and 65% is protected political speech. Should \nsuch a unique website exist, it may attempt to bring an \nas-applied challenge, although that challenge would fail \nunder the Ginsberg/Sable rule. But the possibility that \nsuch a site might exist does not show that a \u201csubstantial \nnumber of [H.B. 1181\u2019s] applications are uncon-\n\n44 \n \nstitutional.\u201d NetChoice, 144 S.Ct. at 2397. The district \ncourt committed a similar error. Pet.App.115a. \nThird, Petitioners did not offer evidence of the bur-\nden on adults they hypothesize. Nothing in the record \ndemonstrates that fear of hypothetical hacking of age-\nverification websites has chilled anyone from visiting any \nwebsite\u2014whether it be to access pornography or any of \nthe other services that require such verification. Supra \npp.9-10. There certainly is no evidence that H.B. 1181 \nhas increased the risk of exposure over the status quo. \nFor example, because some Petitioners operate sub-\nscription-based websites, an individual\u2019s credit-card in-\nformation is already subject to hacking. ROA.250-51. \nMore broadly, \u201c[m]odern cell phones are not just another \ntechnological convenience\u201d but instead \u201chold for many \nAmericans the privacies of life.\u201d Riley v. California, 573 \nU.S. 373, 403 (2014) (citation omitted). Thus, a misplaced \nphone containing \u201c[a]n Internet search and browsing his-\ntory \u2026 could reveal an individual\u2019s private interests or \nconcerns.\u201d Id. at 395. There is no evidence that age veri-\nfication materially increases the risk of privacy violations \nabove what already exists for anyone living in the mod-\nern world\u2014and certainly not in a lopsided number of \ncases.  \nB. Petitioners\u2019 response again fails. \nPetitioners\u2019 attempt (at 24-25, 41-43) to preemptively \nrebut Texas\u2019s argument only underscores why a facial in-\njunction is unwarranted.  \nPetitioners first suggest (at 25) that Texas conceded \nat oral argument that Petitioners\u2019 sites do not contain \nmaterial that is obscene for adults. Not so. Counsel said \nthat H.B. 1181 does not restrict an adult\u2019s access to any \nof the content on Petitioners\u2019 sites. Oral Argument,  \nNo. \n23-50627 \n(Oct. \n4, \n2023) \nat \n13:35-14:10, \n\n45 \n \nhttps://bit.ly/4c5B42K. That statement is correct for the \nreasons discussed at length above. It does not follow, \nhowever, that the material is not obscene.  \nThey next argue (at 24, 42) that Texas elsewhere \ncriminalizes obscenity. That is a non sequitur. For any \nsupposed \u201cchill\u201d argument to succeed, the content on Pe-\ntitioners\u2019 websites must be constitutionally protected. \nThat is a question of federal constitutional law\u2014not \nTexas statutory law. Because no one has a First Amend-\nment right to view much of the content on Petitioners\u2019 \nsites, it is beside the point whether Texas has decided not \nto bar adults from viewing that content as part of this \nstatute. What matters is Petitioners cannot leverage the \nFirst Amendment to attack a state law by complaining \nthat some adults might be chilled from viewing content \nthey have no constitutional right to view.8   \nPetitioners also observe (at 42) that this Court af-\nfirmed facial preliminary injunctions in Ashcroft II and \nReno. But the Court did not conduct facial analysis in \nAshcroft II\u2014indeed, neither the word \u201cfacial\u201d or \u201cface\u201d \nis used in the opinion. And in Reno, the statute was ex-\ntraordinarily broad. See supra p.28-29. Not so here. The \nfacts are also different; because age-verification is now \n \n8 Petitioners overread (at 24-25) Reno and Ashcroft v. Free \nSpeech Coalition, 535 U.S. 234 (2002), to suggest that the Court \nshould ignore obscenity on their websites. In Free Speech Coalition, \nthe Court addressed a statute that sought \u201cto reach beyond obscen-\nity\u201d and made \u201cno attempt to conform to the Miller standard.\u201d 535 \nU.S. at 240. It covered a wide swath of materials that were not ob-\nscene for anyone and was backed by criminal penalties. Id. at 244, \n246-47. By contrast, H.B. 1181 tracks the Miller standard, ad-\ndresses websites containing an extraordinary volume of obscenity \nfor anyone, and is civil. And in Reno, the Court observed that the \nCDA covered extraordinary amounts of \u201cindecent\u201d but non-obscene \ncontent. 521 U.S. at 871. That is not the situation here.   \n\n46 \n \ncommon across many industries and modern technology \nensures privacy, any notion that a sufficiently large num-\nber of adults may be chilled is not credible.    \nPetitioners assert too (at 42) that \u201cthere are no dis-\ntinctions among covered websites that entitle some to \ngreater constitutional protection than others.\u201d That is \npure question begging. If content on some but not all \nsites is obscene even for adults, then there would be a \n\u201cdistinction\u201d across sites. The district court, however, \nfailed to conduct the required analysis.  \nFinally, Petitioners repeatedly suggest (e.g., 1, 6, 24) \nthat H.B. 1181 captures essentially everything because \nit protects young children, too. Texas, however, did the \nsame thing that New York did in Ginsberg\u2014it took this \nCourt\u2019s obscenity standard and applied it to children. Pe-\ntitioners, however, do not claim that New York\u2019s law \ntherefore captured ordinary \u201csex education content.\u201d \nContra Pet.Br.7. It is beyond implausible that Texas \ncourts will construe H.B. 1181 in such a manner, even \nmore so because such content presumably would not be \n\u201cprurient\u201d and would have \u201cserious \u2026 scientific value for \nminors,\u201d Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code \u00a7129B.001(6); see \nalso Ashcroft I, 535 U.S. at 579 & nn.9-10 (plurality op.). \nRegardless, such issues should be resolved in as-applied \nchallenges. And Petitioners\u2019 suggestion (at 27) that those \nwithout identification will suffer is a red herring. Age-\nverification technology does not require government \nidentification, supra pp.9-10, and even if it did, such an \nargument could be the subject of an as-applied suit. \nIV. Petitioners Flunk the Remaining Factors. \nBecause Petitioners are unlikely to succeed on the \nmerits, this Court need go no further. Winter, 555 U.S. \nat 32-33. Even if Petitioners had made that showing, they \nwould not be entitled to a preliminary injunction.   \n\n47 \n \nFirst, Petitioners have not shown \u201c[p]erhaps the sin-\ngle most important prerequisite for\u201d interim relief\u2014that \nthey are \u201clikely to suffer irreparable harm before a deci-\nsion on the merits can be rendered.\u201d 11A Charles Alan \nWright & Arthur R. Miller, Federal Practice & Proce-\ndure \u00a72948.1 (3d ed. Apr. 2023 update). Before the dis-\ntrict court, Petitioners pointed to no evidence that age \nverification has chilled any actual person from accessing \nany website. Nor could they because (1) age verification \nis already a hallmark of many industries, (2) that some-\none has been age verified says nothing about whether \nthat person views pornography, (3) H.B. 1181 forbids \ncovered websites from preserving identifying infor-\nmation, and, (4) regardless, countless adults pay to ac-\ncess Petitioners\u2019 websites with credit cards. It is not \nenough for Petitioners to wave the \u201cchill\u201d flag\u2014they \nneed to prove it. Nor can they rely on compliance costs \nwhen Pornhub and other such websites already have age \nverification built into their systems.     \nSecond, Texas\u2014and millions of children in Texas\u2014\nwill suffer irreparable harm if H.B. 1181 is enjoined, \nwhich has profound consequences for the public interest. \n\u201cAny time a State is enjoined by a court from effectuat-\ning statutes enacted by representatives of its people, it \nsuffers a form of irreparable injury.\u201d Maryland v. King, \n567 U.S. 1301, 1303 (2012). But the harm here is even \nmore significant. H.B. 1181 addresses an ongoing crisis. \nAccord United States v. Morrison, 529 U.S. 598, 614 \n(2000) (noting the \u201cnumerous findings regarding the se-\nrious impact that gender-motivated violence has on vic-\ntims and their families\u201d). Texas is not powerless to ad-\ndress that crisis. The Court thus should again leave the \nstatus quo in place while this litigation continues.   \n\n48 \n \nCONCLUSION \nThe Court should affirm the Fifth Circuit\u2019s judgment.   \nRespectfully submitted. \nKEN PAXTON \nAttorney General of Texas \nBRENT WEBSTER \nFirst Assistant Attorney \n  General \nOFFICE OF THE  \n  ATTORNEY GENERAL \nP.O.

          "task_beliefs": "My model of the case has been consolidated and my analytical path forward has been clarified. The previous update, based on the petitioners' brief, represented a fundamental correction; this internal reasoning step confirms that correction and sets a precise target for the next phase of inquiry.\n\n1.  **Central Legal Conflict (Stable):** The core of the case is firmly established as a conflict over *stare decisis* and the proper standard of review. The central question is whether the Fifth Circuit committed a legal error by applying rational basis review and disregarding the Supreme Court's precedent in *Ashcroft v. ACLU (Ashcroft II)*, which applied strict scrutiny to a similar federal statute. My understanding of the petitioners' framing\u2014that this is a case about lower court defiance of precedent\u2014is now stable.\n\n2.  **Petitioners' Argumentative Structure (Stable):** The petitioners' \"thesis\" is fully mapped and understood. Their primary argument rests on the mandatory application of strict scrutiny due to *Ashcroft II*. Their fallback argument is that H.B. 1181 fails strict scrutiny because a less restrictive alternative (content-filtering software) exists, the law is not narrowly tailored (being both over- and under-inclusive), and it constitutes compelled speech. This model is now considered complete pending the respondent's rebuttal.\n\n3.  **Respondent's Argumentative Structure (Anticipated):** My focus has now shifted entirely to anticipating and discovering the respondent's counter-arguments. The previous analysis of the Yoti amicus brief is held in suspension, as its relevance depends on how Texas structures its defense. The `THINK` observation has crystallized the key questions that the Respondent's Brief on the Merits must answer for me to build a complete model of the case:\n    *   **Defense of the Standard of Review:** How, precisely, will Texas defend the Fifth Circuit's application of rational basis review? Will they adopt the \"government concession\" theory to distinguish *Ashcroft II*, or will they take the more aggressive step of asking the Supreme Court to reconsider or overrule *Ashcroft II* entirely?\n    *   **Rebuttal of Less Restrictive Alternatives:** How will Texas counter the argument that user-side content filters are a viable, less restrictive alternative? Will they argue filters are ineffective, not truly less restrictive, or that the Court's reasoning in *Ashcroft II* is outdated?\n    *   **Defense of Narrow Tailoring:** How will Texas justify the law's scope, particularly its underinclusiveness in exempting major platforms like search engines and social media, against the charge that this undermines the law's compelling interest?\n\n4.  **Prediction & Key Variable (Refined Focus):** My confidence remains shifted toward the petitioners (predicting a reversal of the Fifth Circuit), but this is contingent on the strength of the forthcoming respondent's brief. The key variable\u2014\"Is modern age-verification technology the least restrictive means?\"\u2014is now understood to be a two-part question: (1) Is there a legally cognizable less restrictive alternative (like filtering software)? and (2) How does Texas rebut this claim? My next observation must directly address these points.",

Having fully digested the \"thesis\" (petitioners' brief), the agent's reasoning explicitly concludes that the next necessary action is to seek the \"antithesis\" (respondent's brief) to achieve a valid synthesis.\n8.  **Employ a \"Consolidate, Plan, and Target Uncertainty\" Meta-Heuristic (Strongly Validated):** This observation is a direct and successful *application* of this heuristic. The internal monologue demonstrates the three key steps:\n    *   **Consolidate:** It summarizes the new understanding derived from the petitioners' brief, confirming the major shift in the case model.\n    *   **Plan:** It explicitly states the next action: \"search for and analyze the Respondent's Brief on the Merits.\"\n    *   **Target Uncertainty:** It pinpoints the exact information needed\u2014how Texas will defend its standard of review and rebut the \"less restrictive alternative\" argument. This ensures the next information-gathering step is maximally efficient.\n9.  **Analyze Amicus Briefs as a Strategic Tool:** Validated.\n10. **Prioritize Amicus Briefs from Subject-Matter Experts:** Confirmed.\n11. **Interpret Negative Search Results as Evidence (Refined):** This principle remains stable. The significance of an absent brief is relative to the party's core legal strategy.\n12. **Acknowledge Tool Limitations:** Confirmed.\n13. **Prioritize Foundational Documents (Elevated to Core Principle):** This principle, learned in the last update, is reinforced by the `THINK` step, which reflects on the analytical error caused by violating it and solidifies the commitment to this principle going forward.\n14. **Use the Table of Authorities as a Strategic Map:** This new principle remains a valuable heuristic for future brief analysis."

          "task_beliefs": "My model of the case has now achieved a dialectical synthesis, incorporating the \"antithesis\" of the respondent's brief against the \"thesis\" of the petitioners' brief. The respondent's arguments are robust, multi-layered, and directly address the uncertainties I previously identified, significantly altering my prediction model.\n\n1.  **Central Legal Conflict (Stable but Deepened):** The conflict remains centered on the standard of review (*Ginsberg*'s rational basis vs. *Ashcroft II*'s strict scrutiny). However, Texas has deepened this conflict by not merely distinguishing *Ashcroft II* but by elevating *Ginsberg v. New York* as the dispositive precedent for all regulations on the sale of sexually explicit materials to minors, regardless of the medium (online or offline). The conflict is now a direct clash between two lines of precedent.\n\n2.  **Petitioners' Argumentative Structure (Stable):** My understanding of the petitioners' arguments remains unchanged: *Ashcroft II* mandates strict scrutiny, and H.B. 1181 fails this test because less restrictive alternatives (user-side filters) exist.\n\n3.  **Respondent's Argumentative Structure (Now Fully Mapped):** The respondent's brief provides a comprehensive and powerful counter-narrative. My previous questions are now answered, revealing a sophisticated, layered defense:\n    *   **Defense of the Standard of Review (Primary Argument):** Texas argues that *Ginsberg*'s rational basis test is the correct and controlling standard. They frame H.B. 1181 not as a speech ban, but as a regulation on the *sale* of harmful materials to a specific audience (minors), which they argue falls squarely under *Ginsberg*.\n    *   **The \"Technology Has Evolved\" Argument:** Texas directly confronts *Reno v. ACLU* and *Ashcroft II* by arguing their conclusions were based on the technological limitations of their time. They posit that modern, \"commercially reasonable\" age-verification technology is now widely available and effective, rendering the factual basis for those prior decisions obsolete. This is their key argument for distinguishing precedent without needing to overrule it.\n    *   **Aggressive Fallback Position:** As I anticipated, Texas explicitly asks the Court to overrule *Ashcroft II* if it is found to require strict scrutiny in this context. Their citation to *Janus v. AFSCME* in the Table of Authorities signals they are serious about this request.\n    *   **Survival Under Any Scrutiny (Secondary Argument):** Texas argues in the alternative that H.B. 1181 is so narrowly focused on websites \"dedicated to pornography\" that it would survive even intermediate or strict scrutiny.\n    *   **Procedural Defense (Overarching Argument):** Texas heavily emphasizes the high bar for a pre-enforcement *facial* challenge. Citing the recent *Moody v. NetChoice* decision, they argue the petitioners must show the law is unconstitutional in a \"substantial number of its applications.\" They contend this is impossible because much of the content at issue is obscene even for adults (e.g., \"teen bondage gangbang\" videos), meaning it has no First Amendment protection at all. Therefore, the law has a \"plainly legitimate sweep.\"\n    *   **Rhetorical Framing:** The brief is filled with graphic descriptions of the pornographic content, a clear strategy to frame the petitioners as purveyors of dangerous smut rather than defenders of speech, thereby maximizing the perceived weight of the state's compelling interest in protecting children.\n\n4.  **Prediction & Key Variables (Completely Restructured):** My confidence has shifted from favoring the petitioners to viewing the case as a toss-up, with a slight edge to Texas. The respondent's brief opens up multiple paths for the Court to uphold the law. The key variables are no longer a single question but a cascading hierarchy of legal and factual determinations:\n    1.  **Level 1 (Standard of Review):** Will the Court adopt Texas's view that *Ginsberg* and its rational basis test control, effectively carving out a new exception for online age verification?\n    2.  **Level 2 (Stare Decisis & Technology):** If the Court finds *Ashcroft II* applies, will it accept the argument that technological evolution has made server-side age verification the least restrictive means, distinguishing *Ashcroft II* on its facts?\n    3.  **Level 3 (Procedural Bar):** Independent of the scrutiny level, will the Court find that the petitioners cannot meet the high standard for a facial challenge because the law has a \"legitimate sweep\" in regulating unprotected obscene content?\n    4.  **Level 4 (Overruling Precedent):** As a last resort, would a majority of the Court be willing to formally overrule *Ashcroft II*?\n\nThis observation has been the most significant to date, transforming the case from a seemingly straightforward application of precedent into a complex battle over framing, technological facts, and competing lines of case law.",
          "design_beliefs": "This observation provides powerful validation for my core methodological principles and introduces several new, more nuanced heuristics for analyzing sophisticated legal arguments.\n\n1.  **Adopt a Dialectical Approach (Massively Validated):** The acquisition of the respondent's brief perfectly realized this strategy. The \"thesis\" (petitioners) and \"antithesis\" (respondent) are now both fully understood, allowing for a much more accurate and complete \"synthesis\" of the case's legal dynamics. This confirms that one-sided analysis is inherently flawed.\n2.  **Prioritize Foundational Documents (Massively Validated):** This principle is again proven to be of paramount importance. The respondent's brief was the single most valuable piece of information I could have acquired, directly answering all of my targeted uncertainties.\n3.  **Use the Table of Authorities as a Strategic Map (Strongly Validated):** The ToA was a powerful leading indicator of Texas's strategy. The prominence of *Ginsberg*, the inclusion of *Janus* (signaling intent to overrule precedent), and the citation of very recent cases like *Moody v. NetChoice* provided an immediate, accurate blueprint of their entire argument before I even read the introduction.\n4.  **Deconstruct Argumentative Hierarchies (Strongly Validated):** Texas's brief is a masterclass in layered argumentation (Primary: *Ginsberg*/Rational Basis -> Secondary: Survives Strict Scrutiny -> Fallback: Overrule *Ashcroft II* -> Overarching: Facial Challenge Fails). Recognizing this hierarchical structure is essential to understanding their potential paths to victory.\n5.  **Analyze Framing as a Core Strategy (Strongly Validated):** Texas's reframing of the \"Question Presented\" away from free speech and toward child protection and \"commercially reasonable\" regulation demonstrates the power of framing to control the terms of the debate.\n6.  **NEW HEURISTIC \u2014 The \"Technology Changed\" Argument:** When analyzing cases involving technology, I must actively search for arguments that precedent is factually obsolete due to technological evolution. This is a key judicial tool for distinguishing or limiting past decisions without formally overruling them. Texas's argument that *Ashcroft II*'s logic is outdated is a prime example.\n7.  **NEW HEURISTIC \u2014 The Procedural Posture is a Weapon:** A party's choice of legal challenge (e.g., facial vs. as-applied) and the current procedural stage (e.g., preliminary injunction) are not just context; they are strategic battlegrounds. The high standards of proof for facial challenges or injunctions can be used as a dispositive argument to win a case without reaching the core constitutional merits.\n8.  **NEW HEURISTIC \u2014 \"Argument by Disgust\":** In cases with emotionally charged subject matter, I must be aware of the strategic use of graphic or shocking details. This rhetorical tactic is designed to create an emotional reaction in the judges, amplify the perceived government interest, and delegitimize the opposing party.\n9.  **Leverage Internal Structure, Identify Argumentative Patterns, Map Competing Precedents, Interpret Procedural Filings, Analyze Amicus Briefs, Prioritize Expert Amici, Interpret Negative Search Results, and Acknowledge Tool Limitations:** All these prior principles remain validated and form the bedrock of my analytical framework. This observation has built upon them, adding more sophisticated tools for deconstructing complex appellate advocacy."

ACLU (Ashcroft II), 542 U.S. 656 (2004), \nthe \nCourt \nconsidered \na \ncontent-based \nspeech \nrestriction on sexually explicit materials on the \nInternet that Congress deemed harmful to minors. In \nconsidering this question, the Court assumed that \ncertain protected speech may be regulated, with the \nkey consideration being determining the least \nrestrictive alternative that can be used to achieve that \ngoal. In Ashcroft II, blocking and filtering software \nwas found to be the least restrictive alternative. In \nthis case, age verification technology is proposed as \nthe least restrictive alternative to achieving Texas\u2019s \nuncontested goal of protecting minors from obscene \ncontent on the Internet. \nThe Court in Ashcroft II conducted an in-depth \nanalysis of the viability and effectiveness of filtering \nsoftware circa February 1999\u2014over 25 years ago. The \nCourt found that this technological solution was the \nleast restrictive means of regulating Internet \nobscenity, with the crucial caveat that \u201cit is \nreasonable to assume that other technological \ndevelopments important to the First Amendment \nanalysis have also occurred during that time.\u201d Id. at \n671. \nThis \namicus \nbrief \nis \nabout \n\u201ctechnological \ndevelopments important to the First Amendment \nanalysis,\u201d acknowledging the Court\u2019s finding that \u201cthe \ntechnology of the Internet evolves at a rapid pace.\u201d Id. \nIn this case, the District Court soundly rejected age \nverification technology in favor of content filtering \nsoftware, while the Fifth Circuit held that Texas\u2019s \n\n \n4 \n\u201cage \nverification \nrequirement \nlikely \npasses \nconstitutional \nmuster \nunder \nthe \nrational-basis \nstandard in Ginsberg.\u201d Pet.App.27a. \nUnderstanding \nage \nverification \ntechnologies \nis \nessential to deciding whether their application is the \nleast \nrestrictive \nalternative \nunder \nthe \nFirst \nAmendment. \nARGUMENT \nI. \nAge Verification Technology is the Least \nRestrictive Alternative and is Narrowly \nTailored to Achieve Texas\u2019s Well-Founded \nGoal of Protecting Minors from Obscene \nContent on the Internet \nThis brief outlines practical examples of how current \nage verification technology (also known as age \nassurance technology) is working today, focusing on \nartificial intelligence (AI) driven facial age estimation. \nAI facial age estimation is the most popular age \nverification technology with individuals and the most \nprevalent approach by volume. It does not require \nusing an identity document or other identity data, nor \ndoes it require using facial recognition technology. No \ndatabase is created; no images are stored. The \nalgorithm does not learn anything from each \nadditional age check undertaken. \nYoti Ltd., a worldwide leader in age verification, offers \na wide range of approaches, and has undertaken over \n700 million age checks. Yoti is therefore uniquely \nqualified to explain the ease of use, accuracy, \naffordability, security, effectiveness, and accessibility, \nincluding details on how AI-driven facial age \n\n \n5 \nestimation \nmeets \nrigorous \ndata \nprotection \nrequirements to preserve privacy. This brief details \nexamples of how and where this low-friction \ntechnology is already operating globally at scale with \nleading web platforms. \nEvery month, AI-driven facial age estimation \ntechnology already enables tens of millions of adults \nto verify their age in about one second. The facial \nimage is not stored and there is no reliance on any \nidentity documentation. This technology enables \nplatforms to easily distinguish an adult from a minor \nat a global scale and in the volumes required for global \nplatforms such as Meta. \nWith the user\u2019s consent, Yoti can store the results of a \npreviously completed facial age estimation on the \nuser\u2019s device as a reusable digital ID or wallet. This \ndigital ID or wallet can then be utilized to access any \nwebsite containing adult content. \nTaking this technology one step further, reusable \napproaches, termed \u2018tokens,\u2019 are now available so \nrepeat visitors to an age-gated website, such as adult \ncontent websites, can prove their age once and then \ncontinue to use the generated age verification token \nindefinitely. The French government is the first \ngovernment to issue guidelines authorizing the use of \ntokens as an appropriate method of age verification, \nbeginning when age verification for adult content \ncomes into force in France in January 2025.12 \n \n12 https://www.arcom.fr/nos-ressources/espace-juridique/textes-\njuridiques/referentiel-technique-sur-la-verification-de-lage-\npour-la-protection-des-mineurs-contre-la-pornographie-en-ligne \n\n \n6 \nThere is a range of fallback options and exciting new \npossibilities for how visitors to age-gated websites can \nprove their age and only share their adult status, \nwhile ensuring privacy and security across platforms \nand websites. \nA. \nAge Verification Technology Does \nNot Impose Categorically Different \nBurdens on Adults and is Akin to \nIn-Person Age Verification \nAt a bar, bartenders routinely inspect an individual \nand, based on an initial estimation of their age, decide \nwhether to request a physical identification document \nsuch as a driver's license. To complete manual age \nverification, a government-issued identity document \nneeds to be reviewed to determine whether it is a bona \nfide document, whether the image of the person in the \ndocument matches the person presenting it, and check \nthe date of birth to ascertain if the person is old \nenough to consume alcohol. \nIn today\u2019s online world, platforms are already \nharnessing a range of technologies to assess age, \nfrequently working with independent age verification \nproviders. Platforms can select a range of age \nverification options to offer customers a choice and can \nmake their own determination about what range of \noptions suits their customers, accounting for different \nmarkets, regulatory requirements, and demographics. \nOne technological method emulates the human ability \nto estimate age, as demonstrated by the bartender \nexample of someone with years of experience \ndiscerning adults from minors \u2013 this is facial age \nestimate. \n\n \n7 \nSome age verification methods build on the physical \nreview of the document model by technologically \nchecking the document\u2019s authenticity and then \nchecking that the person presenting it is, in fact, the \nrightful owner. \nThis technology typically utilizes ID document \ndatabases to determine if the format of the document \nbeing presented is authentic, liveness detection to \nensure that the person presenting the document is \nalive, and face matching to compare the person \npresenting the document to the face on the document. \nIn addition, depending on the circumstances, it may \nbe necessary to verify individuals using data points \nfrom authoritative sources such as department of \nmotor vehicle databases, voter registration records, or \ncredit reference databases. \nIt is common for visitors of adult content websites to \nvisit numerous sites over several hours. Since it is \ninconvenient and excessive for such users to undergo \nage verification every time they access adult websites, \nthe age verification technology industry has developed \nreusable tokens that allow users to repeatedly visit \nadult content sites without undergoing repeated age \nverification checks. \nThe typical adult content site consists of an initial \n\u2018landing page\u2019 that can offer several types of age \nverification options, enabling the consumer to pick the \none they prefer. Some methods may involve just one \nor two clicks and take just one or two seconds, \nequivalent to or less than the time it takes a bartender \nto do a visual estimation and ask an individual to dig \nout their ID from their wallet, hand it over, and \npresent it for inspection. \n\n \n8 \nCurrent age verification methods include: \n1. \nEstimating age from a user\u2019s \nfacial image using AI facial \nage estimation technology \nIn everyday life, we are all human age estimators; we \nsubconsciously assess the ages of those we encounter, \ndrawing on our lived experience. Consider a long-\ntenured high school principal. His experience dealing \nwith teenagers would make him more accurate than \nthe average adult at differentiating those under 18 \nfrom those over 18. \nThe most developed age estimation approach, which \nhas been around for over a decade, utilizes a facial \nimage. This image-based technology was initially \nreviewed by NIST over a decade ago and is now part \nof an ongoing NIST benchmarking assessment13 and \nis currently under review by nationally accredited \naudit bodies such as the Age Check Certification \nScheme (ACCS)14 with well-established companies \nsuch as Google, Fujitsu, Idemia providing this service. \nBased on NIST data, these models are likely to be \naccurate within one to three years of the individual\u2019s \nage, depending on the age range. Specifically, the \naccuracy for younger individuals is approximately 1 to \n1.5 years, whereas the accuracy for older individuals \nis around 2-4 years. There is higher accuracy for \nyounger versus older people given that physical \nappearance is impacted over time in relation to the \n \n13 https://pages.nist.gov/frvt/html/frvt_age_estimation.html \n14 See https://accscheme.com/ and \nhttps://accscheme.com/registry/ \n\n \n9 \nindividual\u2019s lived experience. The error rate increases \nwith age, as well. \nWhen a visitor arrives on an adult website landing \npage, the request to prove age may appear in a new \nwindow or a pop-up frame. Most adult content users \naccess websites using mobile devices and are asked to \ntake a photo using their phone\u2019s camera. Desktop \nusers can do the same via their laptop webcam. \nFacial \nage \nestimation \ntechnology \ndetermines \nsomeone\u2019s age using a facial image. The user simply \nlooks at the camera on their device, positions their \nface in the oval shape provided, and takes their photo. \nThe image is then analyzed by an algorithm trained \nto determine age by analyzing facial features from a \ndiverse training set of images where the actual age \nwas known in months and years. \nTo the software model, the new image presented is \nsimply a pattern of pixels, and the pixels are numbers. \nFacial age estimation technology has been trained to \nspot patterns in numbers and pinpoint how people of \na particular age appear in those number patterns. The \nfacial age estimation process usually takes less than \none second. It can produce either a yes/no result on \nwhether the individual in the image meets a \ndesignated age threshold or an estimated age. The \nimage is assessed directly and there is no need to store \nit, so nothing is stored, ensuring the visitor\u2019s privacy. \nIf the visitor meets the age required (e.g., 18+), the age \nestimation technology confirms to the adult website \nthat the user can proceed, and the user can then \naccess the adult content on the website. \n\n \n10 \nA website operator can require an \u2018age buffer\u2019 in years \nabove the age of access. For example, the website \noperator could decide that if the age of access is 18 \nyears and a method is accurate to within 1 to 1.5 \nyears, then this method can be used by all visitors who \nare, for instance, two, three, or five years older than \nthe necessary age, translating to 20, 21 or 23 years \nold. Visitors within this buffer\u2014below 20 in this \nexample\u2014will need to use an additional age \nverification check to help pinpoint their age. \nIn Yoti\u2019s publicly accessible white papers, we \nregularly publish the mean absolute errors, false \npositives, and false negatives for each age group \nacross gender and skin tone. In our most recent white \npaper, published in September 2024, the Yoti \nalgorithm produces a true positive rate for thirteen- to \nseventeen-year-old minors as correctly estimated as \nunder age twenty-one 99.2% of the time. The false \npositives rate reveals that under 1% of fourteen to \nseventeen-year-olds incorrectly judged to be over age \ntwenty-one as 0.03% for fourteen-year-olds, 0.34% for \nfifteen-year-olds, 0.73% for sixteen-year-olds and \n2.43% of seventeen-year-olds.15 \nUsing modern age verification technology, all adults \nabove age twenty or twenty-one can easily and \nsecurely assert their adult status in a privacy-ensured \nway in around one second. This method is highly \naccurate against different ages and skin tones, where \nthe technology is consistently trained at scale and \n \n15 https://www.yoti.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Yoti-Age-\nEstimation-White-Paper-September-2024-PUBLIC.pdf page 31. \n\n \n11 \nusing artificial intelligence is constantly improving \nover time. \nTo achieve a high level of assurance, facial age \nestimation should always be used in combination with \nliveness detection\u2013 including both presentation and \ninjection attack detection\u2013 and be subject to \ncontinuous independent testing and monitoring. \nLiveness checks prevent people from using a photo, \nvideo, or mask instead of taking a live photo. Facial \ninjection attack detection ensures that the image \nbeing analyzed originates from a live source, such as \nthe device camera, and not from a fraudulent or pre-\nrecorded \ninput. \nThis \ntechnique \nverifies \nthe \nauthenticity of the face by distinguishing between \nreal-time facial data and injected, manipulated, or \nreplayed images, helping to prevent spoofing or \nunauthorized access. \nWith the rise of generative AI technology and \ndeepfakes to circumvent age verification checks, the \nability to prevent direct and indirect injection attacks \nis also required.16 Website operators must identify \nand prevent sophisticated injection attacks, ensuring \nthat the images captured during a verification process \nare genuine and remain untampered with.17 \nThe ongoing large scale NIST evaluation uses over 11 \nmillion data points and provides scientific certainty \nfor businesses and governments that facial age \nestimation is an accurate, fair, and privacy-preserving \n \n16 https://www.yoti.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Yoti-How-\nto-combat-Generative-AI-and-deepfakes-white-paper.pdf \n17 https://www.yoti.com/blog/yoti-releases-white-paper-\ndetailing-approach-to-combating-generative-ai-and-deepfakes/ \n\n \n12 \nage assurance solution.18 Audit bodies such as ACCS \nhave been auditing facial age estimation since 2020. \nThey also provide testing, using high-quality test \nimages captured from mobile phones, to provide \ntesting conditions closer to those of adult content and \nsocial media companies. \nFacial age estimation has been approved by a range of \nregulators as a method for age verification to access \nadult content: the German regulators (KJM and FSM) \nhave been using it since 2021 with a 5-year buffer. The \nFrench content and data protection regulators (Arcom \nand CNIL) and the UK data protection and content \nregulators (ICO and OFCOM) clearly state it as an \nappropriate method. \n2. \nDocument-based verification \nusing a physical identity \ndocument \nFor individuals within a defined buffer zone\u2014for \nexample between the ages of eighteen and twenty-\none\u2014other forms of verification, such as document-\nbased verification, can be utilized as a fallback or \nsupplemental method of establishing age. \nDocument-based verification requires assurances that \nthe actual owner of the document is the person \nproviding the document. So, in the same way a \nthorough bartender will carefully compare the \ndocument to the person presenting it, effective online \ndocument-based age verification requires document \nauthenticity checks, face matching, and liveness \nverification. Using these three steps, website \n \n18 https://pages.nist.gov/frvt/reports/aev/fate_aev_report.pdf \n\n \n13 \noperators have a high level of assurance that the \ndocument is authentic, belongs to the right person, \nand that the document owner is the person presenting \nthe document at that discrete moment in time. \nDocument-based age verification technology and \nhuman analysts in Yoti\u2019s 24-hour data security \ncenters review documents to detect a range of fraud \nvectors, including fake, tampered-with, borrowed, or \ncounterfeit documents. \nSharing an identity document might be perceived as \ndisclosing more individually identifying details, such \nas name, nationality, and address, alongside a live \nfacial scan; however, in actuality, just the anonymized \nage attribute or \u201cage over\u201d such as \u201c18\u201d is shared with \nthe adult content site. \nThe Yoti terms of service and industry best practices, \nalong with legal and regulatory requirements in the \nUK and EU, require that only the age result is \ntransferred and that any personal data captured as \npart of a one-time upload of an identity document \nverification check is promptly deleted after the age \nverification check is completed. \n3. \nChecking against databases, \ncredit reference agencies, \nmobile phone operators, and \nother semi-public data \nsources \nThere are a number of techniques that have long been \nused for Know Your Customer checks in financial \nservices and gambling, and as in the example above, \nthey can also be utilized to determine whether a user \nis an adult or a minor. \n\n \n14 \n4. \nReusable digital identity apps \nRepeatedly undergoing age verification checks is not \nonly tiresome, but it can limit users\u2019 engagement and \naccess to legally accessible content. Especially for \nusers close in age to legal adulthood, a more \npermanent method of assuring age is possible by \nusing a digital identity app that allows them to \nestablish their age once and then utilize this proof of \nage in many different contexts, on many different \nwebsites and platforms. \nIn addition to storing document-based verification, a \ndigital ID app can utilize facial age estimation to \nvalidate age once and then share that verification \nwhen required across the Internet. In the physical \nworld, a location might allow visitors seeking access \nto an adult venue to scan a QR code and share a \nverified age estimation via a reusable digital identity \napp. \nIn the online world, a digital identity app simply \ncertifies that the visitor is an adult through a simple \n\u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d check. Nothing further is shared with the \nwebsite operator, and no personal information is \nrevealed, ensuring complete privacy for the user. \n5. \nAge assurance tokens in \nwhich validation on one \nwebsite is transferrable to \nanother website \nAll the above age assurance options can be \nindependently assessed, accredited, and tokenized. \nWebsites can determine which methods they accept, \nwhether to tokenize, and the duration of the tokens. \n\n \n15 \nUsing tokens decreases the costs for relying parties \nand can further reduce any burden by the visitor to \nkeep verifying their age at each adult site they visit. \nAge assurance tokens allow a visitor to determine \ntheir age once using any of the methods above and \nthen use that same verification repeatedly across \nwebsites. An anonymous cookie is added to their \nbrowser which is then accessed by subsequent \nwebsites. Tokens don\u2019t contain any identifiable \ninformation, just the age verification result and \ninformation about how the check was performed. \nTokens can be stored in a confidential age verification \naccount, cached, and utilized over and over again \nindefinitely. \nUsers can pass their age tokens to another browser or, \nafter clearing their cache, by logging on to their age \nverification account. Once cached or re-cached, users \ncan freely visit other sites that accept the token \ncriteria. If a user visits a site with different criteria, \nsuch as a higher age threshold or one requiring a more \nrecently issued token, the user will be asked to \nundertake a new age verification. \nThe information shared with the relying party is the \nsum of the token\u2019s information, as detailed above. This \ncomprises the method of age assurance used, the type \nof age recorded\u2014such as age over, age under, or age \nrange\u2014the issuer of the age token, the type of liveness \ncheck performed, the type of authenticity check \nperformed, and the time and date the check was \nperformed. \n\n \n16 \nB. \nAge Verification Technology Does \nNot Unreasonably Implicate or \nIntrude Upon the Privacy of Adults \nUsing modern age verification technology, as soon as \na visitor\u2019s age is estimated, their facial image is \ndeleted, ensuring their privacy at all times. Visitors \ndo not need to provide personal details like their name \nor date of birth or share any identity documents. The \ntechnology is specifically designed not to identify \nanyone. Unlike facial-recognition technology, age \nverification technology estimates someone\u2019s age \nwithout identity matching that person or acq\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

ACLU (Ashcroft II), 542 U.S. 656 (2004), \nthe \nCourt \nconsidered \na \ncontent-based \nspeech \nrestriction on sexually explicit materials on the \nInternet that Congress deemed harmful to minors. In \nconsidering this question, the Court assumed that \ncertain protected speech may be regulated, with the \nkey consideration being determining the least \nrestrictive alternative that can be used to achieve that \ngoal. In Ashcroft II, blocking and filtering software \nwas found to be the least restrictive alternative. In \nthis case, age verification technology is proposed as \nthe least restrictive alternative to achieving Texas\u2019s \nuncontested goal of protecting minors from obscene \ncontent on the Internet. \nThe Court in Ashcroft II conducted an in-depth \nanalysis of the viability and effectiveness of filtering \nsoftware circa February 1999\u2014over 25 years ago. The \nCourt found that this technological solution was the \nleast restrictive means of regulating Internet \nobscenity, with the crucial caveat that \u201cit is \nreasonable to assume that other technological \ndevelopments important to the First Amendment \nanalysis have also occurred during that time.\u201d Id. at \n671. \nThis \namicus \nbrief \nis \nabout \n\u201ctechnological \ndevelopments important to the First Amendment \nanalysis,\u201d acknowledging the Court\u2019s finding that \u201cthe \ntechnology of the Internet evolves at a rapid pace.\u201d Id. \nIn this case, the District Court soundly rejected age \nverification technology in favor of content filtering \nsoftware, while the Fifth Circuit held that Texas\u2019s \n\n \n4 \n\u201cage \nverification \nrequirement \nlikely \npasses \nconstitutional \nmuster \nunder \nthe \nrational-basis \nstandard in Ginsberg.\u201d Pet.App.27a. \nUnderstanding \nage \nverification \ntechnologies \nis \nessential to deciding whether their application is the \nleast \nrestrictive \nalternative \nunder \nthe \nFirst \nAmendment. \nARGUMENT \nI. \nAge Verification Technology is the Least \nRestrictive Alternative and is Narrowly \nTailored to Achieve Texas\u2019s Well-Founded \nGoal of Protecting Minors from Obscene \nContent on the Internet \nThis brief outlines practical examples of how current \nage verification technology (also known as age \nassurance technology) is working today, focusing on \nartificial intelligence (AI) driven facial age estimation. \nAI facial age estimation is the most popular age \nverification technology with individuals and the most \nprevalent approach by volume. It does not require \nusing an identity document or other identity data, nor \ndoes it require using facial recognition technology. No \ndatabase is created; no images are stored. The \nalgorithm does not learn anything from each \nadditional age check undertaken. \nYoti Ltd., a worldwide leader in age verification, offers \na wide range of approaches, and has undertaken over \n700 million age checks. Yoti is therefore uniquely \nqualified to explain the ease of use, accuracy, \naffordability, security, effectiveness, and accessibility, \nincluding details on how AI-driven facial age \n\n \n5 \nestimation \nmeets \nrigorous \ndata \nprotection \nrequirements to preserve privacy. This brief details \nexamples of how and where this low-friction \ntechnology is already operating globally at scale with \nleading web platforms. \nEvery month, AI-driven facial age estimation \ntechnology already enables tens of millions of adults \nto verify their age in about one second. The facial \nimage is not stored and there is no reliance on any \nidentity documentation. This technology enables \nplatforms to easily distinguish an adult from a minor \nat a global scale and in the volumes required for global \nplatforms such as Meta. \nWith the user\u2019s consent, Yoti can store the results of a \npreviously completed facial age estimation on the \nuser\u2019s device as a reusable digital ID or wallet. This \ndigital ID or wallet can then be utilized to access any \nwebsite containing adult content. \nTaking this technology one step further, reusable \napproaches, termed \u2018tokens,\u2019 are now available so \nrepeat visitors to an age-gated website, such as adult \ncontent websites, can prove their age once and then \ncontinue to use the generated age verification token \nindefinitely. The French government is the first \ngovernment to issue guidelines authorizing the use of \ntokens as an appropriate method of age verification, \nbeginning when age verification for adult content \ncomes into force in France in January 2025.12 \n \n12 https://www.arcom.fr/nos-ressources/espace-juridique/textes-\njuridiques/referentiel-technique-sur-la-verification-de-lage-\npour-la-protection-des-mineurs-contre-la-pornographie-en-ligne \n\n \n6 \nThere is a range of fallback options and exciting new \npossibilities for how visitors to age-gated websites can \nprove their age and only share their adult status, \nwhile ensuring privacy and security across platforms \nand websites. \nA. \nAge Verification Technology Does \nNot Impose Categorically Different \nBurdens on Adults and is Akin to \nIn-Person Age Verification \nAt a bar, bartenders routinely inspect an individual \nand, based on an initial estimation of their age, decide \nwhether to request a physical identification document \nsuch as a driver's license. To complete manual age \nverification, a government-issued identity document \nneeds to be reviewed to determine whether it is a bona \nfide document, whether the image of the person in the \ndocument matches the person presenting it, and check \nthe date of birth to ascertain if the person is old \nenough to consume alcohol. \nIn today\u2019s online world, platforms are already \nharnessing a range of technologies to assess age, \nfrequently working with independent age verification \nproviders. Platforms can select a range of age \nverification options to offer customers a choice and can \nmake their own determination about what range of \noptions suits their customers, accounting for different \nmarkets, regulatory requirements, and demographics. \nOne technological method emulates the human ability \nto estimate age, as demonstrated by the bartender \nexample of someone with years of experience \ndiscerning adults from minors \u2013 this is facial age \nestimate. \n\n \n7 \nSome age verification methods build on the physical \nreview of the document model by technologically \nchecking the document\u2019s authenticity and then \nchecking that the person presenting it is, in fact, the \nrightful owner. \nThis technology typically utilizes ID document \ndatabases to determine if the format of the document \nbeing presented is authentic, liveness detection to \nensure that the person presenting the document is \nalive, and face matching to compare the person \npresenting the document to the face on the document. \nIn addition, depending on the circumstances, it may \nbe necessary to verify individuals using data points \nfrom authoritative sources such as department of \nmotor vehicle databases, voter registration records, or \ncredit reference databases. \nIt is common for visitors of adult content websites to \nvisit numerous sites over several hours. Since it is \ninconvenient and excessive for such users to undergo \nage verification every time they access adult websites, \nthe age verification technology industry has developed \nreusable tokens that allow users to repeatedly visit \nadult content sites without undergoing repeated age \nverification checks. \nThe typical adult content site consists of an initial \n\u2018landing page\u2019 that can offer several types of age \nverification options, enabling the consumer to pick the \none they prefer. Some methods may involve just one \nor two clicks and take just one or two seconds, \nequivalent to or less than the time it takes a bartender \nto do a visual estimation and ask an individual to dig \nout their ID from their wallet, hand it over, and \npresent it for inspection. \n\n \n8 \nCurrent age verification methods include: \n1. \nEstimating age from a user\u2019s \nfacial image using AI facial \nage estimation technology \nIn everyday life, we are all human age estimators; we \nsubconsciously assess the ages of those we encounter, \ndrawing on our lived experience. Consider a long-\ntenured high school principal. His experience dealing \nwith teenagers would make him more accurate than \nthe average adult at differentiating those under 18 \nfrom those over 18. \nThe most developed age estimation approach, which \nhas been around for over a decade, utilizes a facial \nimage. This image-based technology was initially \nreviewed by NIST over a decade ago and is now part \nof an ongoing NIST benchmarking assessment13 and \nis currently under review by nationally accredited \naudit bodies such as the Age Check Certification \nScheme (ACCS)14 with well-established companies \nsuch as Google, Fujitsu, Idemia providing this service. \nBased on NIST data, these models are likely to be \naccurate within one to three years of the individual\u2019s \nage, depending on the age range. Specifically, the \naccuracy for younger individuals is approximately 1 to \n1.5 years, whereas the accuracy for older individuals \nis around 2-4 years. There is higher accuracy for \nyounger versus older people given that physical \nappearance is impacted over time in relation to the \n \n13 https://pages.nist.gov/frvt/html/frvt_age_estimation.html \n14 See https://accscheme.com/ and \nhttps://accscheme.com/registry/ \n\n \n9 \nindividual\u2019s lived experience. The error rate increases \nwith age, as well. \nWhen a visitor arrives on an adult website landing \npage, the request to prove age may appear in a new \nwindow or a pop-up frame. Most adult content users \naccess websites using mobile devices and are asked to \ntake a photo using their phone\u2019s camera. Desktop \nusers can do the same via their laptop webcam. \nFacial \nage \nestimation \ntechnology \ndetermines \nsomeone\u2019s age using a facial image. The user simply \nlooks at the camera on their device, positions their \nface in the oval shape provided, and takes their photo. \nThe image is then analyzed by an algorithm trained \nto determine age by analyzing facial features from a \ndiverse training set of images where the actual age \nwas known in months and years. \nTo the software model, the new image presented is \nsimply a pattern of pixels, and the pixels are numbers. \nFacial age estimation technology has been trained to \nspot patterns in numbers and pinpoint how people of \na particular age appear in those number patterns. The \nfacial age estimation process usually takes less than \none second. It can produce either a yes/no result on \nwhether the individual in the image meets a \ndesignated age threshold or an estimated age. The \nimage is assessed directly and there is no need to store \nit, so nothing is stored, ensuring the visitor\u2019s privacy. \nIf the visitor meets the age required (e.g., 18+), the age \nestimation technology confirms to the adult website \nthat the user can proceed, and the user can then \naccess the adult content on the website. \n\n \n10 \nA website operator can require an \u2018age buffer\u2019 in years \nabove the age of access. For example, the website \noperator could decide that if the age of access is 18 \nyears and a method is accurate to within 1 to 1.5 \nyears, then this method can be used by all visitors who \nare, for instance, two, three, or five years older than \nthe necessary age, translating to 20, 21 or 23 years \nold. Visitors within this buffer\u2014below 20 in this \nexample\u2014will need to use an additional age \nverification check to help pinpoint their age. \nIn Yoti\u2019s publicly accessible white papers, we \nregularly publish the mean absolute errors, false \npositives, and false negatives for each age group \nacross gender and skin tone. In our most recent white \npaper, published in September 2024, the Yoti \nalgorithm produces a true positive rate for thirteen- to \nseventeen-year-old minors as correctly estimated as \nunder age twenty-one 99.2% of the time. The false \npositives rate reveals that under 1% of fourteen to \nseventeen-year-olds incorrectly judged to be over age \ntwenty-one as 0.03% for fourteen-year-olds, 0.34% for \nfifteen-year-olds, 0.73% for sixteen-year-olds and \n2.43% of seventeen-year-olds.15 \nUsing modern age verification technology, all adults \nabove age twenty or twenty-one can easily and \nsecurely assert their adult status in a privacy-ensured \nway in around one second. This method is highly \naccurate against different ages and skin tones, where \nthe technology is consistently trained at scale and \n \n15 https://www.yoti.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Yoti-Age-\nEstimation-White-Paper-September-2024-PUBLIC.pdf page 31. \n\n \n11 \nusing artificial intelligence is constantly improving \nover time. \nTo achieve a high level of assurance, facial age \nestimation should always be used in combination with \nliveness detection\u2013 including both presentation and \ninjection attack detection\u2013 and be subject to \ncontinuous independent testing and monitoring. \nLiveness checks prevent people from using a photo, \nvideo, or mask instead of taking a live photo. Facial \ninjection attack detection ensures that the image \nbeing analyzed originates from a live source, such as \nthe device camera, and not from a fraudulent or pre-\nrecorded \ninput. \nThis \ntechnique \nverifies \nthe \nauthenticity of the face by distinguishing between \nreal-time facial data and injected, manipulated, or \nreplayed images, helping to prevent spoofing or \nunauthorized access. \nWith the rise of generative AI technology and \ndeepfakes to circumvent age verification checks, the \nability to prevent direct and indirect injection attacks \nis also required.16 Website operators must identify \nand prevent sophisticated injection attacks, ensuring \nthat the images captured during a verification process \nare genuine and remain untampered with.17 \nThe ongoing large scale NIST evaluation uses over 11 \nmillion data points and provides scientific certainty \nfor businesses and governments that facial age \nestimation is an accurate, fair, and privacy-preserving \n \n16 https://www.yoti.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Yoti-How-\nto-combat-Generative-AI-and-deepfakes-white-paper.pdf \n17 https://www.yoti.com/blog/yoti-releases-white-paper-\ndetailing-approach-to-combating-generative-ai-and-deepfakes/ \n\n \n12 \nage assurance solution.18 Audit bodies such as ACCS \nhave been auditing facial age estimation since 2020. \nThey also provide testing, using high-quality test \nimages captured from mobile phones, to provide \ntesting conditions closer to those of adult content and \nsocial media companies. \nFacial age estimation has been approved by a range of \nregulators as a method for age verification to access \nadult content: the German regulators (KJM and FSM) \nhave been using it since 2021 with a 5-year buffer. The \nFrench content and data protection regulators (Arcom \nand CNIL) and the UK data protection and content \nregulators (ICO and OFCOM) clearly state it as an \nappropriate method. \n2. \nDocument-based verification \nusing a physical identity \ndocument \nFor individuals within a defined buffer zone\u2014for \nexample between the ages of eighteen and twenty-\none\u2014other forms of verification, such as document-\nbased verification, can be utilized as a fallback or \nsupplemental method of establishing age. \nDocument-based verification requires assurances that \nthe actual owner of the document is the person \nproviding the document. So, in the same way a \nthorough bartender will carefully compare the \ndocument to the person presenting it, effective online \ndocument-based age verification requires document \nauthenticity checks, face matching, and liveness \nverification. Using these three steps, website \n \n18 https://pages.nist.gov/frvt/reports/aev/fate_aev_report.pdf \n\n \n13 \noperators have a high level of assurance that the \ndocument is authentic, belongs to the right person, \nand that the document owner is the person presenting \nthe document at that discrete moment in time. \nDocument-based age verification technology and \nhuman analysts in Yoti\u2019s 24-hour data security \ncenters review documents to detect a range of fraud \nvectors, including fake, tampered-with, borrowed, or \ncounterfeit documents. \nSharing an identity document might be perceived as \ndisclosing more individually identifying details, such \nas name, nationality, and address, alongside a live \nfacial scan; however, in actuality, just the anonymized \nage attribute or \u201cage over\u201d such as \u201c18\u201d is shared with \nthe adult content site. \nThe Yoti terms of service and industry best practices, \nalong with legal and regulatory requirements in the \nUK and EU, require that only the age result is \ntransferred and that any personal data captured as \npart of a one-time upload of an identity document \nverification check is promptly deleted after the age \nverification check is completed. \n3. \nChecking against databases, \ncredit reference agencies, \nmobile phone operators, and \nother semi-public data \nsources \nThere are a number of techniques that have long been \nused for Know Your Customer checks in financial \nservices and gambling, and as in the example above, \nthey can also be utilized to determine whether a user \nis an adult or a minor. \n\n \n14 \n4. \nReusable digital identity apps \nRepeatedly undergoing age verification checks is not \nonly tiresome, but it can limit users\u2019 engagement and \naccess to legally accessible content. Especially for \nusers close in age to legal adulthood, a more \npermanent method of assuring age is possible by \nusing a digital identity app that allows them to \nestablish their age once and then utilize this proof of \nage in many different contexts, on many different \nwebsites and platforms. \nIn addition to storing document-based verification, a \ndigital ID app can utilize facial age estimation to \nvalidate age once and then share that verification \nwhen required across the Internet. In the physical \nworld, a location might allow visitors seeking access \nto an adult venue to scan a QR code and share a \nverified age estimation via a reusable digital identity \napp. \nIn the online world, a digital identity app simply \ncertifies that the visitor is an adult through a simple \n\u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d check. Nothing further is shared with the \nwebsite operator, and no personal information is \nrevealed, ensuring complete privacy for the user. \n5. \nAge assurance tokens in \nwhich validation on one \nwebsite is transferrable to \nanother website \nAll the above age assurance options can be \nindependently assessed, accredited, and tokenized. \nWebsites can determine which methods they accept, \nwhether to tokenize, and the duration of the tokens. \n\n \n15 \nUsing tokens decreases the costs for relying parties \nand can further reduce any burden by the visitor to \nkeep verifying their age at each adult site they visit. \nAge assurance tokens allow a visitor to determine \ntheir age once using any of the methods above and \nthen use that same verification repeatedly across \nwebsites. An anonymous cookie is added to their \nbrowser which is then accessed by subsequent \nwebsites. Tokens don\u2019t contain any identifiable \ninformation, just the age verification result and \ninformation about how the check was performed. \nTokens can be stored in a confidential age verification \naccount, cached, and utilized over and over again \nindefinitely. \nUsers can pass their age tokens to another browser or, \nafter clearing their cache, by logging on to their age \nverification account. Once cached or re-cached, users \ncan freely visit other sites that accept the token \ncriteria. If a user visits a site with different criteria, \nsuch as a higher age threshold or one requiring a more \nrecently issued token, the user will be asked to \nundertake a new age verification. \nThe information shared with the relying party is the \nsum of the token\u2019s information, as detailed above. This \ncomprises the method of age assurance used, the type \nof age recorded\u2014such as age over, age under, or age \nrange\u2014the issuer of the age token, the type of liveness \ncheck performed, the type of authenticity check \nperformed, and the time and date the check was \nperformed. \n\n \n16 \nB. \nAge Verification Technology Does \nNot Unreasonably Implicate or \nIntrude Upon the Privacy of Adults \nUsing modern age verification technology, as soon as \na visitor\u2019s age is estimated, their facial image is \ndeleted, ensuring their privacy at all times. Visitors \ndo not need to provide personal details like their name \nor date of birth or share any identity documents. The \ntechnology is specifically designed not to identify \nanyone. Unlike facial-recognition technology, age \nverification technology estimates someone\u2019s age \nwithout identity matching that person or acquiring \nany details from them other than the facial image \nwhich is instantly assessed and then is no longer \nneeded, and therefore does not need to be stored.19 \nC. \nAge Verification Technology is \nCurrently being Successfully \nUtilized Worldwide \nMany of the largest and most successful social media, \nadult content websites, and gaming platforms already \nuse age verification technology, with millions of \nchecks being conducted monthly. \n \n \n \n \n19 https://ico.org.uk/media/for-\norganisations/documents/4020427/yoti-sandbox-\nexit_report_20220522.pdf \n\n \n17 \n \nExamples include: \nMeta, \nincluding \nFacebook \nDating, \nInstagram, and, more recently, Instagram \nTeen Accounts, utilizes age verification \ntechnology to support age-appropriate \naccess to these services. When Facebook \nDating and Instagram detect a user \nattempting to change their date of birth \nfrom under 18 to over 18, they deploy Yoti\u2019s \nfacial age estimation as one of the ways the \nperson can establish that they are an adult. \nThis tool has been deployed by Meta since \n2022. Meta recently introduced Instagram \nTeen \nAccounts \nwith \nbuilt-in \ndefault \nprotections limiting who can contact and \nthe content teen users can access. Teens \nunder sixteen need an adult\u2019s permission to \nuse less protective settings. For teen users \nwho want to switch to an adult account, \nInstagram uses Yoti facial age estimation, \namong other tools, to establish eligibility \nfor such an account. \n\n \n18 \nOnlyFans, \na \nsubscription-based \nsocial \nmedia platform for adults where both \ncreators and subscribers must be over \neighteen, \ndeploys \nage \nverification \ntechnology in many countries to ensure \nthat those engaging with the platform are \nadults. \nYubo, \na \nlive-streaming \nsocial \nmedia \nplatform with almost 60 million users, \noffers a service for adults and a separate \nservice for thirteen to seventeen-year-olds. \nSince 2022, Yubo has been using facial age \nestimation as its first point of contact to \nensure that users are old enough and \nprovided access to the proper content. Yubo \nemploys a fallback option for users close to \nage 18, such as using the Yoti reusable \ndigital ID app or a one-time document \nsubmission. \nD. \nTexas Can Impose a Content-Based \nSpeech Restriction on Sexually \nExplicit Materials on the Internet \nEven if it Results in a Cost to the \nWebsites and Platforms Hosting the \nContent \nCost is an understated but important issue in deciding \nthe least restrictive means of regulating Internet \nobscenity. The end user almost always bears the cost \nof blocking and filtering software, while the website \nprofiting from obscenity and adult content almost \nalways bears the cost of age verification technology. \nCost-shifting refers to allocating a policy or practice\u2019s \n\n \n19 \nexpenses or financial burdens to one party while \nallowing others to shirk or reduce these costs. \nUnder the First Amendment, the government cannot \nimpose a financial burden on speakers based on the \ncontent of their speech. Rosenberger v. Rector & \nVisitors of Univ. of Virginia, 515 U.S. 819, 828 (1995). \nHowever, imposing a cost is permissible if it is \n\u201cdesigned to meet the expenses incident to the \nadministration of the law.\u201d Forsyth Cnty., Ga. v. \nNationalist Movement, 505 U.S. 123, 129 n. 8 (1992). \nOne example is requiring fees and paid permits for \ngroups \nand \nindividuals \nexercising \ntheir \nFirst \nAmendment right to protest. Concerning permit fees, \nthe Supreme Court has ruled that costs must be \nreasonable and not prohibitively expensive, that they \ncannot be based on the content of the speech or the \nviewpoint of the demonstrators, and that they \ntypically cover administrative expenses such as \nprocessing the permit application, coordinating with \nlaw enforcement, and ensuring public safety during \nthe event. See e.g. iMatter Utah v. Njord, 774 F.3d \n1258 (10th Cir. 2014); Surita v. Hyde, 665 F.3d 860 \n(7th Cir. 2011). \nThe same principles can be applied when online adult \ncontent providers require age verification. In the case \nof age verification, cost-shifting legitimately places \nthe cost of age verification technology on the providers \nof adult content rather than on the consumers who \nwould otherwise incur costs by having to install and \nmaintain monitoring and filtering software on their \nown devices. Since the costs of operating and \nmaintaining modern age verification technology are \nno longer prohibitively expensive or unreasonable, \n\n \n20 \nrequiring adult websites to incur these costs does not \nviolate the websites\u2019 First Amendment rights.20  \nFurthermore, this cost evaluation does not consider \nthe actual negative societal costs when minors can \naccess explicit adult content, nor does it consider the \nundue burden that parents incur for the entire \nresponsibility of filtering, monitoring, and installing \nmonitoring and filtering software on their children\u2019s \nand shared family devices. \nWhen it comes to obscenity, the government has a \nmuch wider latitude to determine and impose costs, \nboth tangible and intangible. In Paris Adult Theatre I \nv. Slaton, 413 U.S. 49, 57\u201358 (1973), the Court held \nthat \u201cthere are legitimate state interests at stake in \nstemming the tide of commercialized obscenity, even \nassuming it is feasible to enforce effective safeguards \nagainst exposure to juveniles and to passersby. Rights \nand interests \u2018other than those of the advocates are \ninvolved.\u2019 These include the interest of the public in \nthe quality of life and the total community \nenvironment, the tone of commerce in the great city \ncenters, and, possibly, the public safety itself.\u201d \nInternal citations removed. \n \n \n \n20 See Declaration of Tony Allen: \u201cYoti state that their Age \nVerification Service (AVS) pricing ranges between $0.03 (for \nlarge volumes e.g. circa 100 M, $0.10 for circa 5M checks and \n$0.31 for lower volumes, one time account based checks e.g. \nunder 100,000). They also offer free, $0.0 shares of 18 plus \nattributes from the reusable Yoti digital identity app\u2026.\u201d \nJ.A.201. \n\n \n21 \nCONCLUSION \n\u201cUnderstandably those who entertain an absolutist \nview of the First Amendment find it uncomfortable to \nexplain why rights of association, speech, and press \nshould be severely restrained in the marketplace of \ngoods and money, but not in the marketplace of \npornography.\u201d Paris Adult Theatre I v. Slaton, 413 \nU.S. 49, 60\u201362 (1973). \nConsidering the arguments presented, it is evident \nthat \ncurrent \nage \nverification \ntechnologies, \nparticularly AI facial age estimation, offer practical, \nprivacy-preserving, and scalable solutions for online \nage verification. This technology provides a secure \nand efficient method for websites and platforms to \ncomply with legal requirements while respecting user \nprivacy. The methods outlined, including the reuse of \nage tokens and digital identity apps, further reduce \nuser friction while maintaining high accuracy and \nsecurity at a low cost. \nGiven the demonstrated effectiveness of these \ntechnologies in protecting minors and enabling adults \nto assert their age without unnecessary intrusion, the \nCourt should recognize that AI-driven facial age \nestimation \nsolutions \nare \nthe \nleast \nrestrictive \nalternative under the First Amendment when \nrestricting sexually explicit materials on the Internet. \nFor these reasons, Yoti Ltd. respectfully submits that \nthe Court should support the implementation of these \nadvanced age assurance technologies as a reliable \nmethod to comply with age verification requirements \nwhile also safeguarding privacy and promoting \naccessibility for all users. \n\n \n22 \nRESPECTFULLY SUBMITTED \nJAMES R.

          "task_beliefs": "My understanding of the case has reached a point of synthesis based on the primary arguments, and this observation, being an internal reflection on strategy, solidifies that model while setting the stage for the next phase of inquiry. My beliefs about the case itself remain stable.\n\n1.  **Central Legal Conflict (Stable):** The core of the case is the direct conflict between two competing lines of precedent: *Ginsberg v. New York*, which suggests a rational basis review for regulating minors' access to sexually explicit material, and *Ashcroft v. ACLU (Ashcroft II)*, which applied strict scrutiny to a similar federal law (COPA). Texas's strategy is to elevate *Ginsberg* as the controlling precedent for all such regulations, regardless of medium.\n\n2.  **Petitioners' Position (Stable):** The petitioners' argument rests on the direct application of *Ashcroft II*, asserting that H.B. 1181 is a content-based restriction on speech that must fail strict scrutiny because less restrictive, user-side alternatives (like filtering software) exist.\n\n3.  **Respondent's Multi-Pronged Defense (Stable):** Texas has constructed a robust, layered defense that provides the Court with multiple avenues to rule in its favor:\n    *   **Primary Argument:** *Ginsberg*'s rational basis test is the correct standard for regulating the *sale* (or commercial provision) of harmful-to-minors material, and H.B. 1181 fits this mold.\n    *   **Factual Distinction:** The factual premise of *Ashcroft II*\u2014that effective age verification was not technologically feasible\u2014is now obsolete. Modern, \"commercially reasonable\" technology makes server-side verification the least restrictive *effective* means.\n    *   **Procedural Weapon:** The petitioners are bringing a pre-enforcement *facial* challenge, which requires them to show the law is unconstitutional in a \"substantial number of its applications\" (*Moody v. NetChoice*). Texas argues this is impossible because the law has a \"plainly legitimate sweep\" in regulating unprotected obscenity.\n    *   **Fallback Position:** If the Court finds *Ashcroft II* applies and is not factually distinguishable, it should be overruled.\n    *   **Rhetorical Framing:** The brief uses graphic descriptions of pornography to emphasize the state's compelling interest and frame the petitioners as purveyors of smut, not defenders of speech.\n\n4.  **Prediction Model (Stable):** My prediction has shifted from favoring the petitioners to a toss-up, with Texas having a slight edge due to its multiple potential paths to victory. The outcome depends on a cascading series of questions the Court must answer:\n    1.  **Standard of Review:** Is it *Ginsberg* (rational basis) or *Ashcroft II* (strict scrutiny)?\n    2.  **Technology & Precedent:** If strict scrutiny applies, has technology evolved enough to make server-side verification the least restrictive means, thus distinguishing *Ashcroft II* on its facts?\n    3.  **Procedural Bar:** Can the petitioners overcome the high bar for a facial challenge, regardless of the scrutiny level?\n    4.  **Stare Decisis:** Is there a majority willing to overrule *Ashcroft II*?\n\n5.  **Next Area of Uncertainty:** The arguments from the primary parties are now clear. The most significant remaining uncertainty lies in the breadth and nature of support for each side, the introduction of new factual evidence (especially regarding technology's effectiveness and privacy implications), and novel legal angles that could be introduced by *amici curiae*. The next step is to analyze these briefs, starting with those supporting the petitioners.",
          "design_beliefs": "This observation, an act of pure meta-cognition, does not introduce new case facts but significantly refines my strategic framework for information gathering. It validates my existing methodology and adds a crucial layer of sophistication regarding the sequencing and purpose of inquiry.\n\n1.  **Adopt a Dialectical Approach (Massively Validated):** This principle is the foundation of the current state of knowledge. Having established the \"thesis\" (petitioners) and \"antithesis\" (respondent), I have a synthesized view of the core legal conflict.\n2.  **Prioritize Foundational Documents (Massively Validated):** The analysis of the two merits briefs has provided the essential argumentative structure of the case.\n3.  **Analyze Amicus Briefs (Refined and Actionable):** My previous general principle to analyze amicus briefs is now refined with a specific set of objectives. The goal is not just to read them, but to use them to:\n    *   Map the ideological and commercial coalitions supporting each side.\n    *   Extract new factual evidence (e.g., technical reports on age verification, social science data on harm to minors, economic impact studies) that the primary parties may not have focused on.\n    *   Identify novel legal theories or arguments that could influence a Justice's reasoning.\n    *   Gauge which arguments have the most traction among interested third parties.\n4.  **NEW HEURISTIC \u2014 Strategic Sequencing of Information Gathering:** The process of inquiry should be deliberate and structured. After establishing the core dialectic with foundational documents, the next phase should be a systematic exploration of supporting materials. The decision to analyze petitioner-side amici first is a conscious choice to build a complete and robust model of the arguments *against* the law before turning to the arguments in its favor. This ensures a balanced, incremental build-up of knowledge and prevents being prematurely swayed by the last-read argument.\n5.  **Use the Table of Authorities as a Strategic Map (Strongly Validated):** Remains a key heuristic for quickly diagnosing a brief's core strategy.\n6.  **Deconstruct Argumentative Hierarchies (Strongly Validated):** Essential for understanding sophisticated legal strategies like the one deployed by Texas.\n7.  **The \"Technology Changed\" Argument (Strongly Validated):** Remains a critical lens for any case involving technology and precedent.\n8.  **The Procedural Posture is a Weapon (Strongly Validated):** The high bar for a facial challenge is not a footnote; it's a potential dispositive argument for Texas.\n9.  **\"Argument by Disgust\" (Strongly Validated):** Recognizing the strategic use of emotionally charged content is crucial for objective analysis.\n10. **All Prior Heuristics (Stable and Integrated):** The full suite of previously validated principles\u2014including analyzing framing, leveraging internal structure, mapping competing precedents, and acknowledging tool limitations\u2014continues to form the robust foundation of my analytical methodology. This observation has built upon that foundation by adding a more sophisticated, forward-looking strategic layer to my information-gathering plan."

ACLU (Ashcroft II), 542 U.S. 656 (2004), \nthe \nCourt \nconsidered \na \ncontent-based \nspeech \nrestriction on sexually explicit materials on the \nInternet that Congress deemed harmful to minors. In \nconsidering this question, the Court assumed that \ncertain protected speech may be regulated, with the \nkey consideration being determining the least \nrestrictive alternative that can be used to achieve that \ngoal. In Ashcroft II, blocking and filtering software \nwas found to be the least restrictive alternative. In \nthis case, age verification technology is proposed as \nthe least restrictive alternative to achieving Texas\u2019s \nuncontested goal of protecting minors from obscene \ncontent on the Internet. \nThe Court in Ashcroft II conducted an in-depth \nanalysis of the viability and effectiveness of filtering \nsoftware circa February 1999\u2014over 25 years ago. The \nCourt found that this technological solution was the \nleast restrictive means of regulating Internet \nobscenity, with the crucial caveat that \u201cit is \nreasonable to assume that other technological \ndevelopments important to the First Amendment \nanalysis have also occurred during that time.\u201d Id. at \n671. \nThis \namicus \nbrief \nis \nabout \n\u201ctechnological \ndevelopments important to the First Amendment \nanalysis,\u201d acknowledging the Court\u2019s finding that \u201cthe \ntechnology of the Internet evolves at a rapid pace.\u201d Id. \nIn this case, the District Court soundly rejected age \nverification technology in favor of content filtering \nsoftware, while the Fifth Circuit held that Texas\u2019s \n\n \n4 \n\u201cage \nverification \nrequirement \nlikely \npasses \nconstitutional \nmuster \nunder \nthe \nrational-basis \nstandard in Ginsberg.\u201d Pet.App.27a. \nUnderstanding \nage \nverification \ntechnologies \nis \nessential to deciding whether their application is the \nleast \nrestrictive \nalternative \nunder \nthe \nFirst \nAmendment. \nARGUMENT \nI. \nAge Verification Technology is the Least \nRestrictive Alternative and is Narrowly \nTailored to Achieve Texas\u2019s Well-Founded \nGoal of Protecting Minors from Obscene \nContent on the Internet \nThis brief outlines practical examples of how current \nage verification technology (also known as age \nassurance technology) is working today, focusing on \nartificial intelligence (AI) driven facial age estimation. \nAI facial age estimation is the most popular age \nverification technology with individuals and the most \nprevalent approach by volume. It does not require \nusing an identity document or other identity data, nor \ndoes it require using facial recognition technology. No \ndatabase is created; no images are stored. The \nalgorithm does not learn anything from each \nadditional age check undertaken. \nYoti Ltd., a worldwide leader in age verification, offers \na wide range of approaches, and has undertaken over \n700 million age checks. Yoti is therefore uniquely \nqualified to explain the ease of use, accuracy, \naffordability, security, effectiveness, and accessibility, \nincluding details on how AI-driven facial age \n\n \n5 \nestimation \nmeets \nrigorous \ndata \nprotection \nrequirements to preserve privacy. This brief details \nexamples of how and where this low-friction \ntechnology is already operating globally at scale with \nleading web platforms. \nEvery month, AI-driven facial age estimation \ntechnology already enables tens of millions of adults \nto verify their age in about one second. The facial \nimage is not stored and there is no reliance on any \nidentity documentation. This technology enables \nplatforms to easily distinguish an adult from a minor \nat a global scale and in the volumes required for global \nplatforms such as Meta. \nWith the user\u2019s consent, Yoti can store the results of a \npreviously completed facial age estimation on the \nuser\u2019s device as a reusable digital ID or wallet. This \ndigital ID or wallet can then be utilized to access any \nwebsite containing adult content. \nTaking this technology one step further, reusable \napproaches, termed \u2018tokens,\u2019 are now available so \nrepeat visitors to an age-gated website, such as adult \ncontent websites, can prove their age once and then \ncontinue to use the generated age verification token \nindefinitely. The French government is the first \ngovernment to issue guidelines authorizing the use of \ntokens as an appropriate method of age verification, \nbeginning when age verification for adult content \ncomes into force in France in January 2025.12 \n \n12 https://www.arcom.fr/nos-ressources/espace-juridique/textes-\njuridiques/referentiel-technique-sur-la-verification-de-lage-\npour-la-protection-des-mineurs-contre-la-pornographie-en-ligne \n\n \n6 \nThere is a range of fallback options and exciting new \npossibilities for how visitors to age-gated websites can \nprove their age and only share their adult status, \nwhile ensuring privacy and security across platforms \nand websites. \nA. \nAge Verification Technology Does \nNot Impose Categorically Different \nBurdens on Adults and is Akin to \nIn-Person Age Verification \nAt a bar, bartenders routinely inspect an individual \nand, based on an initial estimation of their age, decide \nwhether to request a physical identification document \nsuch as a driver's license. To complete manual age \nverification, a government-issued identity document \nneeds to be reviewed to determine whether it is a bona \nfide document, whether the image of the person in the \ndocument matches the person presenting it, and check \nthe date of birth to ascertain if the person is old \nenough to consume alcohol. \nIn today\u2019s online world, platforms are already \nharnessing a range of technologies to assess age, \nfrequently working with independent age verification \nproviders. Platforms can select a range of age \nverification options to offer customers a choice and can \nmake their own determination about what range of \noptions suits their customers, accounting for different \nmarkets, regulatory requirements, and demographics. \nOne technological method emulates the human ability \nto estimate age, as demonstrated by the bartender \nexample of someone with years of experience \ndiscerning adults from minors \u2013 this is facial age \nestimate. \n\n \n7 \nSome age verification methods build on the physical \nreview of the document model by technologically \nchecking the document\u2019s authenticity and then \nchecking that the person presenting it is, in fact, the \nrightful owner. \nThis technology typically utilizes ID document \ndatabases to determine if the format of the document \nbeing presented is authentic, liveness detection to \nensure that the person presenting the document is \nalive, and face matching to compare the person \npresenting the document to the face on the document. \nIn addition, depending on the circumstances, it may \nbe necessary to verify individuals using data points \nfrom authoritative sources such as department of \nmotor vehicle databases, voter registration records, or \ncredit reference databases. \nIt is common for visitors of adult content websites to \nvisit numerous sites over several hours. Since it is \ninconvenient and excessive for such users to undergo \nage verification every time they access adult websites, \nthe age verification technology industry has developed \nreusable tokens that allow users to repeatedly visit \nadult content sites without undergoing repeated age \nverification checks. \nThe typical adult content site consists of an initial \n\u2018landing page\u2019 that can offer several types of age \nverification options, enabling the consumer to pick the \none they prefer. Some methods may involve just one \nor two clicks and take just one or two seconds, \nequivalent to or less than the time it takes a bartender \nto do a visual estimation and ask an individual to dig \nout their ID from their wallet, hand it over, and \npresent it for inspection. \n\n \n8 \nCurrent age verification methods include: \n1. \nEstimating age from a user\u2019s \nfacial image using AI facial \nage estimation technology \nIn everyday life, we are all human age estimators; we \nsubconsciously assess the ages of those we encounter, \ndrawing on our lived experience. Consider a long-\ntenured high school principal. His experience dealing \nwith teenagers would make him more accurate than \nthe average adult at differentiating those under 18 \nfrom those over 18. \nThe most developed age estimation approach, which \nhas been around for over a decade, utilizes a facial \nimage. This image-based technology was initially \nreviewed by NIST over a decade ago and is now part \nof an ongoing NIST benchmarking assessment13 and \nis currently under review by nationally accredited \naudit bodies such as the Age Check Certification \nScheme (ACCS)14 with well-established companies \nsuch as Google, Fujitsu, Idemia providing this service. \nBased on NIST data, these models are likely to be \naccurate within one to three years of the individual\u2019s \nage, depending on the age range. Specifically, the \naccuracy for younger individuals is approximately 1 to \n1.5 years, whereas the accuracy for older individuals \nis around 2-4 years. There is higher accuracy for \nyounger versus older people given that physical \nappearance is impacted over time in relation to the \n \n13 https://pages.nist.gov/frvt/html/frvt_age_estimation.html \n14 See https://accscheme.com/ and \nhttps://accscheme.com/registry/ \n\n \n9 \nindividual\u2019s lived experience. The error rate increases \nwith age, as well. \nWhen a visitor arrives on an adult website landing \npage, the request to prove age may appear in a new \nwindow or a pop-up frame. Most adult content users \naccess websites using mobile devices and are asked to \ntake a photo using their phone\u2019s camera. Desktop \nusers can do the same via their laptop webcam. \nFacial \nage \nestimation \ntechnology \ndetermines \nsomeone\u2019s age using a facial image. The user simply \nlooks at the camera on their device, positions their \nface in the oval shape provided, and takes their photo. \nThe image is then analyzed by an algorithm trained \nto determine age by analyzing facial features from a \ndiverse training set of images where the actual age \nwas known in months and years. \nTo the software model, the new image presented is \nsimply a pattern of pixels, and the pixels are numbers. \nFacial age estimation technology has been trained to \nspot patterns in numbers and pinpoint how people of \na particular age appear in those number patterns. The \nfacial age estimation process usually takes less than \none second. It can produce either a yes/no result on \nwhether the individual in the image meets a \ndesignated age threshold or an estimated age. The \nimage is assessed directly and there is no need to store \nit, so nothing is stored, ensuring the visitor\u2019s privacy. \nIf the visitor meets the age required (e.g., 18+), the age \nestimation technology confirms to the adult website \nthat the user can proceed, and the user can then \naccess the adult content on the website. \n\n \n10 \nA website operator can require an \u2018age buffer\u2019 in years \nabove the age of access. For example, the website \noperator could decide that if the age of access is 18 \nyears and a method is accurate to within 1 to 1.5 \nyears, then this method can be used by all visitors who \nare, for instance, two, three, or five years older than \nthe necessary age, translating to 20, 21 or 23 years \nold. Visitors within this buffer\u2014below 20 in this \nexample\u2014will need to use an additional age \nverification check to help pinpoint their age. \nIn Yoti\u2019s publicly accessible white papers, we \nregularly publish the mean absolute errors, false \npositives, and false negatives for each age group \nacross gender and skin tone. In our most recent white \npaper, published in September 2024, the Yoti \nalgorithm produces a true positive rate for thirteen- to \nseventeen-year-old minors as correctly estimated as \nunder age twenty-one 99.2% of the time. The false \npositives rate reveals that under 1% of fourteen to \nseventeen-year-olds incorrectly judged to be over age \ntwenty-one as 0.03% for fourteen-year-olds, 0.34% for \nfifteen-year-olds, 0.73% for sixteen-year-olds and \n2.43% of seventeen-year-olds.15 \nUsing modern age verification technology, all adults \nabove age twenty or twenty-one can easily and \nsecurely assert their adult status in a privacy-ensured \nway in around one second. This method is highly \naccurate against different ages and skin tones, where \nthe technology is consistently trained at scale and \n \n15 https://www.yoti.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Yoti-Age-\nEstimation-White-Paper-September-2024-PUBLIC.pdf page 31. \n\n \n11 \nusing artificial intelligence is constantly improving \nover time. \nTo achieve a high level of assurance, facial age \nestimation should always be used in combination with \nliveness detection\u2013 including both presentation and \ninjection attack detection\u2013 and be subject to \ncontinuous independent testing and monitoring. \nLiveness checks prevent people from using a photo, \nvideo, or mask instead of taking a live photo. Facial \ninjection attack detection ensures that the image \nbeing analyzed originates from a live source, such as \nthe device camera, and not from a fraudulent or pre-\nrecorded \ninput. \nThis \ntechnique \nverifies \nthe \nauthenticity of the face by distinguishing between \nreal-time facial data and injected, manipulated, or \nreplayed images, helping to prevent spoofing or \nunauthorized access. \nWith the rise of generative AI technology and \ndeepfakes to circumvent age verification checks, the \nability to prevent direct and indirect injection attacks \nis also required.16 Website operators must identify \nand prevent sophisticated injection attacks, ensuring \nthat the images captured during a verification process \nare genuine and remain untampered with.17 \nThe ongoing large scale NIST evaluation uses over 11 \nmillion data points and provides scientific certainty \nfor businesses and governments that facial age \nestimation is an accurate, fair, and privacy-preserving \n \n16 https://www.yoti.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Yoti-How-\nto-combat-Generative-AI-and-deepfakes-white-paper.pdf \n17 https://www.yoti.com/blog/yoti-releases-white-paper-\ndetailing-approach-to-combating-generative-ai-and-deepfakes/ \n\n \n12 \nage assurance solution.18 Audit bodies such as ACCS \nhave been auditing facial age estimation since 2020. \nThey also provide testing, using high-quality test \nimages captured from mobile phones, to provide \ntesting conditions closer to those of adult content and \nsocial media companies. \nFacial age estimation has been approved by a range of \nregulators as a method for age verification to access \nadult content: the German regulators (KJM and FSM) \nhave been using it since 2021 with a 5-year buffer. The \nFrench content and data protection regulators (Arcom \nand CNIL) and the UK data protection and content \nregulators (ICO and OFCOM) clearly state it as an \nappropriate method. \n2. \nDocument-based verification \nusing a physical identity \ndocument \nFor individuals within a defined buffer zone\u2014for \nexample between the ages of eighteen and twenty-\none\u2014other forms of verification, such as document-\nbased verification, can be utilized as a fallback or \nsupplemental method of establishing age. \nDocument-based verification requires assurances that \nthe actual owner of the document is the person \nproviding the document. So, in the same way a \nthorough bartender will carefully compare the \ndocument to the person presenting it, effective online \ndocument-based age verification requires document \nauthenticity checks, face matching, and liveness \nverification. Using these three steps, website \n \n18 https://pages.nist.gov/frvt/reports/aev/fate_aev_report.pdf \n\n \n13 \noperators have a high level of assurance that the \ndocument is authentic, belongs to the right person, \nand that the document owner is the person presenting \nthe document at that discrete moment in time. \nDocument-based age verification technology and \nhuman analysts in Yoti\u2019s 24-hour data security \ncenters review documents to detect a range of fraud \nvectors, including fake, tampered-with, borrowed, or \ncounterfeit documents. \nSharing an identity document might be perceived as \ndisclosing more individually identifying details, such \nas name, nationality, and address, alongside a live \nfacial scan; however, in actuality, just the anonymized \nage attribute or \u201cage over\u201d such as \u201c18\u201d is shared with \nthe adult content site. \nThe Yoti terms of service and industry best practices, \nalong with legal and regulatory requirements in the \nUK and EU, require that only the age result is \ntransferred and that any personal data captured as \npart of a one-time upload of an identity document \nverification check is promptly deleted after the age \nverification check is completed. \n3. \nChecking against databases, \ncredit reference agencies, \nmobile phone operators, and \nother semi-public data \nsources \nThere are a number of techniques that have long been \nused for Know Your Customer checks in financial \nservices and gambling, and as in the example above, \nthey can also be utilized to determine whether a user \nis an adult or a minor. \n\n \n14 \n4. \nReusable digital identity apps \nRepeatedly undergoing age verification checks is not \nonly tiresome, but it can limit users\u2019 engagement and \naccess to legally accessible content. Especially for \nusers close in age to legal adulthood, a more \npermanent method of assuring age is possible by \nusing a digital identity app that allows them to \nestablish their age once and then utilize this proof of \nage in many different contexts, on many different \nwebsites and platforms. \nIn addition to storing document-based verification, a \ndigital ID app can utilize facial age estimation to \nvalidate age once and then share that verification \nwhen required across the Internet. In the physical \nworld, a location might allow visitors seeking access \nto an adult venue to scan a QR code and share a \nverified age estimation via a reusable digital identity \napp. \nIn the online world, a digital identity app simply \ncertifies that the visitor is an adult through a simple \n\u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d check. Nothing further is shared with the \nwebsite operator, and no personal information is \nrevealed, ensuring complete privacy for the user. \n5. \nAge assurance tokens in \nwhich validation on one \nwebsite is transferrable to \nanother website \nAll the above age assurance options can be \nindependently assessed, accredited, and tokenized. \nWebsites can determine which methods they accept, \nwhether to tokenize, and the duration of the tokens. \n\n \n15 \nUsing tokens decreases the costs for relying parties \nand can further reduce any burden by the visitor to \nkeep verifying their age at each adult site they visit. \nAge assurance tokens allow a visitor to determine \ntheir age once using any of the methods above and \nthen use that same verification repeatedly across \nwebsites. An anonymous cookie is added to their \nbrowser which is then accessed by subsequent \nwebsites. Tokens don\u2019t contain any identifiable \ninformation, just the age verification result and \ninformation about how the check was performed. \nTokens can be stored in a confidential age verification \naccount, cached, and utilized over and over again \nindefinitely. \nUsers can pass their age tokens to another browser or, \nafter clearing their cache, by logging on to their age \nverification account. Once cached or re-cached, users \ncan freely visit other sites that accept the token \ncriteria. If a user visits a site with different criteria, \nsuch as a higher age threshold or one requiring a more \nrecently issued token, the user will be asked to \nundertake a new age verification. \nThe information shared with the relying party is the \nsum of the token\u2019s information, as detailed above. This \ncomprises the method of age assurance used, the type \nof age recorded\u2014such as age over, age under, or age \nrange\u2014the issuer of the age token, the type of liveness \ncheck performed, the type of authenticity check \nperformed, and the time and date the check was \nperformed. \n\n \n16 \nB. \nAge Verification Technology Does \nNot Unreasonably Implicate or \nIntrude Upon the Privacy of Adults \nUsing modern age verification technology, as soon as \na visitor\u2019s age is estimated, their facial image is \ndeleted, ensuring their privacy at all times. Visitors \ndo not need to provide personal details like their name \nor date of birth or share any identity documents. The \ntechnology is specifically designed not to identify \nanyone. Unlike facial-recognition technology, age \nverification technology estimates someone\u2019s age \nwithout identity matching that person or acq\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

ACLU (Ashcroft II), 542 U.S. 656 (2004), \nthe \nCourt \nconsidered \na \ncontent-based \nspeech \nrestriction on sexually explicit materials on the \nInternet that Congress deemed harmful to minors. In \nconsidering this question, the Court assumed that \ncertain protected speech may be regulated, with the \nkey consideration being determining the least \nrestrictive alternative that can be used to achieve that \ngoal. In Ashcroft II, blocking and filtering software \nwas found to be the least restrictive alternative. In \nthis case, age verification technology is proposed as \nthe least restrictive alternative to achieving Texas\u2019s \nuncontested goal of protecting minors from obscene \ncontent on the Internet. \nThe Court in Ashcroft II conducted an in-depth \nanalysis of the viability and effectiveness of filtering \nsoftware circa February 1999\u2014over 25 years ago. The \nCourt found that this technological solution was the \nleast restrictive means of regulating Internet \nobscenity, with the crucial caveat that \u201cit is \nreasonable to assume that other technological \ndevelopments important to the First Amendment \nanalysis have also occurred during that time.\u201d Id. at \n671. \nThis \namicus \nbrief \nis \nabout \n\u201ctechnological \ndevelopments important to the First Amendment \nanalysis,\u201d acknowledging the Court\u2019s finding that \u201cthe \ntechnology of the Internet evolves at a rapid pace.\u201d Id. \nIn this case, the District Court soundly rejected age \nverification technology in favor of content filtering \nsoftware, while the Fifth Circuit held that Texas\u2019s \n\n \n4 \n\u201cage \nverification \nrequirement \nlikely \npasses \nconstitutional \nmuster \nunder \nthe \nrational-basis \nstandard in Ginsberg.\u201d Pet.App.27a. \nUnderstanding \nage \nverification \ntechnologies \nis \nessential to deciding whether their application is the \nleast \nrestrictive \nalternative \nunder \nthe \nFirst \nAmendment. \nARGUMENT \nI. \nAge Verification Technology is the Least \nRestrictive Alternative and is Narrowly \nTailored to Achieve Texas\u2019s Well-Founded \nGoal of Protecting Minors from Obscene \nContent on the Internet \nThis brief outlines practical examples of how current \nage verification technology (also known as age \nassurance technology) is working today, focusing on \nartificial intelligence (AI) driven facial age estimation. \nAI facial age estimation is the most popular age \nverification technology with individuals and the most \nprevalent approach by volume. It does not require \nusing an identity document or other identity data, nor \ndoes it require using facial recognition technology. No \ndatabase is created; no images are stored. The \nalgorithm does not learn anything from each \nadditional age check undertaken. \nYoti Ltd., a worldwide leader in age verification, offers \na wide range of approaches, and has undertaken over \n700 million age checks. Yoti is therefore uniquely \nqualified to explain the ease of use, accuracy, \naffordability, security, effectiveness, and accessibility, \nincluding details on how AI-driven facial age \n\n \n5 \nestimation \nmeets \nrigorous \ndata \nprotection \nrequirements to preserve privacy. This brief details \nexamples of how and where this low-friction \ntechnology is already operating globally at scale with \nleading web platforms. \nEvery month, AI-driven facial age estimation \ntechnology already enables tens of millions of adults \nto verify their age in about one second. The facial \nimage is not stored and there is no reliance on any \nidentity documentation. This technology enables \nplatforms to easily distinguish an adult from a minor \nat a global scale and in the volumes required for global \nplatforms such as Meta. \nWith the user\u2019s consent, Yoti can store the results of a \npreviously completed facial age estimation on the \nuser\u2019s device as a reusable digital ID or wallet. This \ndigital ID or wallet can then be utilized to access any \nwebsite containing adult content. \nTaking this technology one step further, reusable \napproaches, termed \u2018tokens,\u2019 are now available so \nrepeat visitors to an age-gated website, such as adult \ncontent websites, can prove their age once and then \ncontinue to use the generated age verification token \nindefinitely. The French government is the first \ngovernment to issue guidelines authorizing the use of \ntokens as an appropriate method of age verification, \nbeginning when age verification for adult content \ncomes into force in France in January 2025.12 \n \n12 https://www.arcom.fr/nos-ressources/espace-juridique/textes-\njuridiques/referentiel-technique-sur-la-verification-de-lage-\npour-la-protection-des-mineurs-contre-la-pornographie-en-ligne \n\n \n6 \nThere is a range of fallback options and exciting new \npossibilities for how visitors to age-gated websites can \nprove their age and only share their adult status, \nwhile ensuring privacy and security across platforms \nand websites. \nA. \nAge Verification Technology Does \nNot Impose Categorically Different \nBurdens on Adults and is Akin to \nIn-Person Age Verification \nAt a bar, bartenders routinely inspect an individual \nand, based on an initial estimation of their age, decide \nwhether to request a physical identification document \nsuch as a driver's license. To complete manual age \nverification, a government-issued identity document \nneeds to be reviewed to determine whether it is a bona \nfide document, whether the image of the person in the \ndocument matches the person presenting it, and check \nthe date of birth to ascertain if the person is old \nenough to consume alcohol. \nIn today\u2019s online world, platforms are already \nharnessing a range of technologies to assess age, \nfrequently working with independent age verification \nproviders. Platforms can select a range of age \nverification options to offer customers a choice and can \nmake their own determination about what range of \noptions suits their customers, accounting for different \nmarkets, regulatory requirements, and demographics. \nOne technological method emulates the human ability \nto estimate age, as demonstrated by the bartender \nexample of someone with years of experience \ndiscerning adults from minors \u2013 this is facial age \nestimate. \n\n \n7 \nSome age verification methods build on the physical \nreview of the document model by technologically \nchecking the document\u2019s authenticity and then \nchecking that the person presenting it is, in fact, the \nrightful owner. \nThis technology typically utilizes ID document \ndatabases to determine if the format of the document \nbeing presented is authentic, liveness detection to \nensure that the person presenting the document is \nalive, and face matching to compare the person \npresenting the document to the face on the document. \nIn addition, depending on the circumstances, it may \nbe necessary to verify individuals using data points \nfrom authoritative sources such as department of \nmotor vehicle databases, voter registration records, or \ncredit reference databases. \nIt is common for visitors of adult content websites to \nvisit numerous sites over several hours. Since it is \ninconvenient and excessive for such users to undergo \nage verification every time they access adult websites, \nthe age verification technology industry has developed \nreusable tokens that allow users to repeatedly visit \nadult content sites without undergoing repeated age \nverification checks. \nThe typical adult content site consists of an initial \n\u2018landing page\u2019 that can offer several types of age \nverification options, enabling the consumer to pick the \none they prefer. Some methods may involve just one \nor two clicks and take just one or two seconds, \nequivalent to or less than the time it takes a bartender \nto do a visual estimation and ask an individual to dig \nout their ID from their wallet, hand it over, and \npresent it for inspection. \n\n \n8 \nCurrent age verification methods include: \n1. \nEstimating age from a user\u2019s \nfacial image using AI facial \nage estimation technology \nIn everyday life, we are all human age estimators; we \nsubconsciously assess the ages of those we encounter, \ndrawing on our lived experience. Consider a long-\ntenured high school principal. His experience dealing \nwith teenagers would make him more accurate than \nthe average adult at differentiating those under 18 \nfrom those over 18. \nThe most developed age estimation approach, which \nhas been around for over a decade, utilizes a facial \nimage. This image-based technology was initially \nreviewed by NIST over a decade ago and is now part \nof an ongoing NIST benchmarking assessment13 and \nis currently under review by nationally accredited \naudit bodies such as the Age Check Certification \nScheme (ACCS)14 with well-established companies \nsuch as Google, Fujitsu, Idemia providing this service. \nBased on NIST data, these models are likely to be \naccurate within one to three years of the individual\u2019s \nage, depending on the age range. Specifically, the \naccuracy for younger individuals is approximately 1 to \n1.5 years, whereas the accuracy for older individuals \nis around 2-4 years. There is higher accuracy for \nyounger versus older people given that physical \nappearance is impacted over time in relation to the \n \n13 https://pages.nist.gov/frvt/html/frvt_age_estimation.html \n14 See https://accscheme.com/ and \nhttps://accscheme.com/registry/ \n\n \n9 \nindividual\u2019s lived experience. The error rate increases \nwith age, as well. \nWhen a visitor arrives on an adult website landing \npage, the request to prove age may appear in a new \nwindow or a pop-up frame. Most adult content users \naccess websites using mobile devices and are asked to \ntake a photo using their phone\u2019s camera. Desktop \nusers can do the same via their laptop webcam. \nFacial \nage \nestimation \ntechnology \ndetermines \nsomeone\u2019s age using a facial image. The user simply \nlooks at the camera on their device, positions their \nface in the oval shape provided, and takes their photo. \nThe image is then analyzed by an algorithm trained \nto determine age by analyzing facial features from a \ndiverse training set of images where the actual age \nwas known in months and years. \nTo the software model, the new image presented is \nsimply a pattern of pixels, and the pixels are numbers. \nFacial age estimation technology has been trained to \nspot patterns in numbers and pinpoint how people of \na particular age appear in those number patterns. The \nfacial age estimation process usually takes less than \none second. It can produce either a yes/no result on \nwhether the individual in the image meets a \ndesignated age threshold or an estimated age. The \nimage is assessed directly and there is no need to store \nit, so nothing is stored, ensuring the visitor\u2019s privacy. \nIf the visitor meets the age required (e.g., 18+), the age \nestimation technology confirms to the adult website \nthat the user can proceed, and the user can then \naccess the adult content on the website. \n\n \n10 \nA website operator can require an \u2018age buffer\u2019 in years \nabove the age of access. For example, the website \noperator could decide that if the age of access is 18 \nyears and a method is accurate to within 1 to 1.5 \nyears, then this method can be used by all visitors who \nare, for instance, two, three, or five years older than \nthe necessary age, translating to 20, 21 or 23 years \nold. Visitors within this buffer\u2014below 20 in this \nexample\u2014will need to use an additional age \nverification check to help pinpoint their age. \nIn Yoti\u2019s publicly accessible white papers, we \nregularly publish the mean absolute errors, false \npositives, and false negatives for each age group \nacross gender and skin tone. In our most recent white \npaper, published in September 2024, the Yoti \nalgorithm produces a true positive rate for thirteen- to \nseventeen-year-old minors as correctly estimated as \nunder age twenty-one 99.2% of the time. The false \npositives rate reveals that under 1% of fourteen to \nseventeen-year-olds incorrectly judged to be over age \ntwenty-one as 0.03% for fourteen-year-olds, 0.34% for \nfifteen-year-olds, 0.73% for sixteen-year-olds and \n2.43% of seventeen-year-olds.15 \nUsing modern age verification technology, all adults \nabove age twenty or twenty-one can easily and \nsecurely assert their adult status in a privacy-ensured \nway in around one second. This method is highly \naccurate against different ages and skin tones, where \nthe technology is consistently trained at scale and \n \n15 https://www.yoti.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Yoti-Age-\nEstimation-White-Paper-September-2024-PUBLIC.pdf page 31. \n\n \n11 \nusing artificial intelligence is constantly improving \nover time. \nTo achieve a high level of assurance, facial age \nestimation should always be used in combination with \nliveness detection\u2013 including both presentation and \ninjection attack detection\u2013 and be subject to \ncontinuous independent testing and monitoring. \nLiveness checks prevent people from using a photo, \nvideo, or mask instead of taking a live photo. Facial \ninjection attack detection ensures that the image \nbeing analyzed originates from a live source, such as \nthe device camera, and not from a fraudulent or pre-\nrecorded \ninput. \nThis \ntechnique \nverifies \nthe \nauthenticity of the face by distinguishing between \nreal-time facial data and injected, manipulated, or \nreplayed images, helping to prevent spoofing or \nunauthorized access. \nWith the rise of generative AI technology and \ndeepfakes to circumvent age verification checks, the \nability to prevent direct and indirect injection attacks \nis also required.16 Website operators must identify \nand prevent sophisticated injection attacks, ensuring \nthat the images captured during a verification process \nare genuine and remain untampered with.17 \nThe ongoing large scale NIST evaluation uses over 11 \nmillion data points and provides scientific certainty \nfor businesses and governments that facial age \nestimation is an accurate, fair, and privacy-preserving \n \n16 https://www.yoti.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Yoti-How-\nto-combat-Generative-AI-and-deepfakes-white-paper.pdf \n17 https://www.yoti.com/blog/yoti-releases-white-paper-\ndetailing-approach-to-combating-generative-ai-and-deepfakes/ \n\n \n12 \nage assurance solution.18 Audit bodies such as ACCS \nhave been auditing facial age estimation since 2020. \nThey also provide testing, using high-quality test \nimages captured from mobile phones, to provide \ntesting conditions closer to those of adult content and \nsocial media companies. \nFacial age estimation has been approved by a range of \nregulators as a method for age verification to access \nadult content: the German regulators (KJM and FSM) \nhave been using it since 2021 with a 5-year buffer. The \nFrench content and data protection regulators (Arcom \nand CNIL) and the UK data protection and content \nregulators (ICO and OFCOM) clearly state it as an \nappropriate method. \n2. \nDocument-based verification \nusing a physical identity \ndocument \nFor individuals within a defined buffer zone\u2014for \nexample between the ages of eighteen and twenty-\none\u2014other forms of verification, such as document-\nbased verification, can be utilized as a fallback or \nsupplemental method of establishing age. \nDocument-based verification requires assurances that \nthe actual owner of the document is the person \nproviding the document. So, in the same way a \nthorough bartender will carefully compare the \ndocument to the person presenting it, effective online \ndocument-based age verification requires document \nauthenticity checks, face matching, and liveness \nverification. Using these three steps, website \n \n18 https://pages.nist.gov/frvt/reports/aev/fate_aev_report.pdf \n\n \n13 \noperators have a high level of assurance that the \ndocument is authentic, belongs to the right person, \nand that the document owner is the person presenting \nthe document at that discrete moment in time. \nDocument-based age verification technology and \nhuman analysts in Yoti\u2019s 24-hour data security \ncenters review documents to detect a range of fraud \nvectors, including fake, tampered-with, borrowed, or \ncounterfeit documents. \nSharing an identity document might be perceived as \ndisclosing more individually identifying details, such \nas name, nationality, and address, alongside a live \nfacial scan; however, in actuality, just the anonymized \nage attribute or \u201cage over\u201d such as \u201c18\u201d is shared with \nthe adult content site. \nThe Yoti terms of service and industry best practices, \nalong with legal and regulatory requirements in the \nUK and EU, require that only the age result is \ntransferred and that any personal data captured as \npart of a one-time upload of an identity document \nverification check is promptly deleted after the age \nverification check is completed. \n3. \nChecking against databases, \ncredit reference agencies, \nmobile phone operators, and \nother semi-public data \nsources \nThere are a number of techniques that have long been \nused for Know Your Customer checks in financial \nservices and gambling, and as in the example above, \nthey can also be utilized to determine whether a user \nis an adult or a minor. \n\n \n14 \n4. \nReusable digital identity apps \nRepeatedly undergoing age verification checks is not \nonly tiresome, but it can limit users\u2019 engagement and \naccess to legally accessible content. Especially for \nusers close in age to legal adulthood, a more \npermanent method of assuring age is possible by \nusing a digital identity app that allows them to \nestablish their age once and then utilize this proof of \nage in many different contexts, on many different \nwebsites and platforms. \nIn addition to storing document-based verification, a \ndigital ID app can utilize facial age estimation to \nvalidate age once and then share that verification \nwhen required across the Internet. In the physical \nworld, a location might allow visitors seeking access \nto an adult venue to scan a QR code and share a \nverified age estimation via a reusable digital identity \napp. \nIn the online world, a digital identity app simply \ncertifies that the visitor is an adult through a simple \n\u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d check. Nothing further is shared with the \nwebsite operator, and no personal information is \nrevealed, ensuring complete privacy for the user. \n5. \nAge assurance tokens in \nwhich validation on one \nwebsite is transferrable to \nanother website \nAll the above age assurance options can be \nindependently assessed, accredited, and tokenized. \nWebsites can determine which methods they accept, \nwhether to tokenize, and the duration of the tokens. \n\n \n15 \nUsing tokens decreases the costs for relying parties \nand can further reduce any burden by the visitor to \nkeep verifying their age at each adult site they visit. \nAge assurance tokens allow a visitor to determine \ntheir age once using any of the methods above and \nthen use that same verification repeatedly across \nwebsites. An anonymous cookie is added to their \nbrowser which is then accessed by subsequent \nwebsites. Tokens don\u2019t contain any identifiable \ninformation, just the age verification result and \ninformation about how the check was performed. \nTokens can be stored in a confidential age verification \naccount, cached, and utilized over and over again \nindefinitely. \nUsers can pass their age tokens to another browser or, \nafter clearing their cache, by logging on to their age \nverification account. Once cached or re-cached, users \ncan freely visit other sites that accept the token \ncriteria. If a user visits a site with different criteria, \nsuch as a higher age threshold or one requiring a more \nrecently issued token, the user will be asked to \nundertake a new age verification. \nThe information shared with the relying party is the \nsum of the token\u2019s information, as detailed above. This \ncomprises the method of age assurance used, the type \nof age recorded\u2014such as age over, age under, or age \nrange\u2014the issuer of the age token, the type of liveness \ncheck performed, the type of authenticity check \nperformed, and the time and date the check was \nperformed. \n\n \n16 \nB. \nAge Verification Technology Does \nNot Unreasonably Implicate or \nIntrude Upon the Privacy of Adults \nUsing modern age verification technology, as soon as \na visitor\u2019s age is estimated, their facial image is \ndeleted, ensuring their privacy at all times. Visitors \ndo not need to provide personal details like their name \nor date of birth or share any identity documents. The \ntechnology is specifically designed not to identify \nanyone. Unlike facial-recognition technology, age \nverification technology estimates someone\u2019s age \nwithout identity matching that person or acquiring \nany details from them other than the facial image \nwhich is instantly assessed and then is no longer \nneeded, and therefore does not need to be stored.19 \nC. \nAge Verification Technology is \nCurrently being Successfully \nUtilized Worldwide \nMany of the largest and most successful social media, \nadult content websites, and gaming platforms already \nuse age verification technology, with millions of \nchecks being conducted monthly. \n \n \n \n \n19 https://ico.org.uk/media/for-\norganisations/documents/4020427/yoti-sandbox-\nexit_report_20220522.pdf \n\n \n17 \n \nExamples include: \nMeta, \nincluding \nFacebook \nDating, \nInstagram, and, more recently, Instagram \nTeen Accounts, utilizes age verification \ntechnology to support age-appropriate \naccess to these services. When Facebook \nDating and Instagram detect a user \nattempting to change their date of birth \nfrom under 18 to over 18, they deploy Yoti\u2019s \nfacial age estimation as one of the ways the \nperson can establish that they are an adult. \nThis tool has been deployed by Meta since \n2022. Meta recently introduced Instagram \nTeen \nAccounts \nwith \nbuilt-in \ndefault \nprotections limiting who can contact and \nthe content teen users can access. Teens \nunder sixteen need an adult\u2019s permission to \nuse less protective settings. For teen users \nwho want to switch to an adult account, \nInstagram uses Yoti facial age estimation, \namong other tools, to establish eligibility \nfor such an account. \n\n \n18 \nOnlyFans, \na \nsubscription-based \nsocial \nmedia platform for adults where both \ncreators and subscribers must be over \neighteen, \ndeploys \nage \nverification \ntechnology in many countries to ensure \nthat those engaging with the platform are \nadults. \nYubo, \na \nlive-streaming \nsocial \nmedia \nplatform with almost 60 million users, \noffers a service for adults and a separate \nservice for thirteen to seventeen-year-olds. \nSince 2022, Yubo has been using facial age \nestimation as its first point of contact to \nensure that users are old enough and \nprovided access to the proper content. Yubo \nemploys a fallback option for users close to \nage 18, such as using the Yoti reusable \ndigital ID app or a one-time document \nsubmission. \nD. \nTexas Can Impose a Content-Based \nSpeech Restriction on Sexually \nExplicit Materials on the Internet \nEven if it Results in a Cost to the \nWebsites and Platforms Hosting the \nContent \nCost is an understated but important issue in deciding \nthe least restrictive means of regulating Internet \nobscenity. The end user almost always bears the cost \nof blocking and filtering software, while the website \nprofiting from obscenity and adult content almost \nalways bears the cost of age verification technology. \nCost-shifting refers to allocating a policy or practice\u2019s \n\n \n19 \nexpenses or financial burdens to one party while \nallowing others to shirk or reduce these costs. \nUnder the First Amendment, the government cannot \nimpose a financial burden on speakers based on the \ncontent of their speech. Rosenberger v. Rector & \nVisitors of Univ. of Virginia, 515 U.S. 819, 828 (1995). \nHowever, imposing a cost is permissible if it is \n\u201cdesigned to meet the expenses incident to the \nadministration of the law.\u201d Forsyth Cnty., Ga. v. \nNationalist Movement, 505 U.S. 123, 129 n. 8 (1992). \nOne example is requiring fees and paid permits for \ngroups \nand \nindividuals \nexercising \ntheir \nFirst \nAmendment right to protest. Concerning permit fees, \nthe Supreme Court has ruled that costs must be \nreasonable and not prohibitively expensive, that they \ncannot be based on the content of the speech or the \nviewpoint of the demonstrators, and that they \ntypically cover administrative expenses such as \nprocessing the permit application, coordinating with \nlaw enforcement, and ensuring public safety during \nthe event. See e.g. iMatter Utah v. Njord, 774 F.3d \n1258 (10th Cir. 2014); Surita v. Hyde, 665 F.3d 860 \n(7th Cir. 2011). \nThe same principles can be applied when online adult \ncontent providers require age verification. In the case \nof age verification, cost-shifting legitimately places \nthe cost of age verification technology on the providers \nof adult content rather than on the consumers who \nwould otherwise incur costs by having to install and \nmaintain monitoring and filtering software on their \nown devices. Since the costs of operating and \nmaintaining modern age verification technology are \nno longer prohibitively expensive or unreasonable, \n\n \n20 \nrequiring adult websites to incur these costs does not \nviolate the websites\u2019 First Amendment rights.20  \nFurthermore, this cost evaluation does not consider \nthe actual negative societal costs when minors can \naccess explicit adult content, nor does it consider the \nundue burden that parents incur for the entire \nresponsibility of filtering, monitoring, and installing \nmonitoring and filtering software on their children\u2019s \nand shared family devices. \nWhen it comes to obscenity, the government has a \nmuch wider latitude to determine and impose costs, \nboth tangible and intangible. In Paris Adult Theatre I \nv. Slaton, 413 U.S. 49, 57\u201358 (1973), the Court held \nthat \u201cthere are legitimate state interests at stake in \nstemming the tide of commercialized obscenity, even \nassuming it is feasible to enforce effective safeguards \nagainst exposure to juveniles and to passersby. Rights \nand interests \u2018other than those of the advocates are \ninvolved.\u2019 These include the interest of the public in \nthe quality of life and the total community \nenvironment, the tone of commerce in the great city \ncenters, and, possibly, the public safety itself.\u201d \nInternal citations removed. \n \n \n \n20 See Declaration of Tony Allen: \u201cYoti state that their Age \nVerification Service (AVS) pricing ranges between $0.03 (for \nlarge volumes e.g. circa 100 M, $0.10 for circa 5M checks and \n$0.31 for lower volumes, one time account based checks e.g. \nunder 100,000). They also offer free, $0.0 shares of 18 plus \nattributes from the reusable Yoti digital identity app\u2026.\u201d \nJ.A.201. \n\n \n21 \nCONCLUSION \n\u201cUnderstandably those who entertain an absolutist \nview of the First Amendment find it uncomfortable to \nexplain why rights of association, speech, and press \nshould be severely restrained in the marketplace of \ngoods and money, but not in the marketplace of \npornography.\u201d Paris Adult Theatre I v. Slaton, 413 \nU.S. 49, 60\u201362 (1973). \nConsidering the arguments presented, it is evident \nthat \ncurrent \nage \nverification \ntechnologies, \nparticularly AI facial age estimation, offer practical, \nprivacy-preserving, and scalable solutions for online \nage verification. This technology provides a secure \nand efficient method for websites and platforms to \ncomply with legal requirements while respecting user \nprivacy. The methods outlined, including the reuse of \nage tokens and digital identity apps, further reduce \nuser friction while maintaining high accuracy and \nsecurity at a low cost. \nGiven the demonstrated effectiveness of these \ntechnologies in protecting minors and enabling adults \nto assert their age without unnecessary intrusion, the \nCourt should recognize that AI-driven facial age \nestimation \nsolutions \nare \nthe \nleast \nrestrictive \nalternative under the First Amendment when \nrestricting sexually explicit materials on the Internet. \nFor these reasons, Yoti Ltd. respectfully submits that \nthe Court should support the implementation of these \nadvanced age assurance technologies as a reliable \nmethod to comply with age verification requirements \nwhile also safeguarding privacy and promoting \naccessibility for all users. \n\n \n22 \nRESPECTFULLY SUBMITTED \nJAMES R.

          "task_beliefs": "My understanding of the case's factual and legal landscape has been substantially deepened by this observation. While my core model of the legal conflict remains, the factual basis for one of the key arguments has been rendered far more concrete and credible.\n\n1.  **Central Legal Conflict (Stable):** The core of the case remains the clash between the *Ginsberg v. New York* (rational basis) and *Ashcroft v. ACLU (Ashcroft II)* (strict scrutiny) precedents.\n\n2.  **Petitioners' Position (Stable but Under Pressure):** The petitioners' argument that H.B. 1181 must fail strict scrutiny because less restrictive alternatives exist is now facing a highly detailed, technical rebuttal. Their reliance on *Ashcroft II*'s finding that user-side filtering is the least restrictive means is directly challenged by this new evidence suggesting server-side technology is now superior.\n\n3.  **Respondent's Multi-Pronged Defense (Substantially Strengthened):** The amicus brief from Yoti Ltd. provides a massive infusion of factual support for Texas's second and most crucial argument: that the technological premise of *Ashcroft II* is obsolete.\n    *   **Primary Argument (*Ginsberg*) (Stable):** This remains Texas's preferred legal standard.\n    *   **Factual Distinction (Massively Bolstered):** This is the most significant update. The abstract claim that \"technology has changed\" is now supported by specific, real-world evidence from a market leader.\n        *   **Specific Technologies:** I can now identify the proposed solutions: AI-driven facial age estimation, document-based verification, reusable digital identity apps, and anonymous age-assurance tokens.\n        *   **Privacy-Preserving Design:** The Yoti brief argues these systems are *not* facial recognition. They are designed to estimate age from an image that is immediately deleted, sharing only an anonymized \"over 18\" signal, thus countering the petitioners' likely privacy-based attacks.\n        *   **Effectiveness & Scalability:** The brief claims tens of millions of checks are already performed monthly for major platforms (Meta, TikTok), and the technology has been benchmarked by NIST and approved by European regulators (Germany, UK, France). This counters the argument that such systems are theoretical or unworkable.\n    *   **Procedural Weapon (Stable):** The high bar for a facial challenge remains a key defense for Texas.\n    *   **Fallback Position (Stable):** The argument to overrule *Ashcroft II* remains in play.\n    *   **Rhetorical Framing (Stable):** The use of \"argument by disgust\" is a separate, parallel track.\n\n4.  **Prediction Model (Shifted):** My prediction, previously a toss-up leaning slightly to Texas, now leans more firmly toward Texas. The Yoti brief provides the Court with a detailed, expert (though commercially interested) factual record it can use to distinguish *Ashcroft II* without having to overrule it. This significantly strengthens one of Texas's primary paths to victory. The cascading questions are now updated with this new factual context:\n    1.  **Standard of Review:** *Ginsberg* or *Ashcroft II*? (Unchanged)\n    2.  **Technology & Precedent:** If strict scrutiny applies, has technology evolved to make server-side verification the least restrictive *effective* means? **(This brief provides a powerful \"Yes\" to this question, making it a more plausible off-ramp for the Court).**\n    3.  **Procedural Bar:** Can the petitioners overcome the facial challenge standard? (Unchanged)\n    4.  **Stare Decisis:** Is there a majority to overrule *Ashcroft II*? (Unchanged, but distinguishing it on the facts is now an easier alternative).\n\n5.  **Next Area of Uncertainty (Refined):** My plan was to analyze petitioner-side amici. The unexpected result of this search makes that even more critical. I now need to see how the petitioners and their supporters rebut these specific technological claims. Do they have their own technical experts? Do they argue the privacy intrusions are greater than Yoti claims? Do they challenge the accuracy or bias of the algorithms? The factual battle over technology is now a central and well-defined front in this case.",
          "design_beliefs": "This observation was highly generative, not only for the task but for my strategic methodology. It introduced a failure condition that was itself informative and created a new, crucial category for source evaluation.\n\n1.  **Adopt a Dialectical Approach (Strongly Validated):** This observation adds a new layer to the dialectic: the factual premise of a precedent (*Ashcroft II*'s 1999-era technology) versus the claimed factual reality of today. The synthesis requires reconciling legal doctrine with technological evolution.\n\n2.  **Prioritize Foundational Documents (Strongly Validated):** This remains the essential first step for establishing the core arguments.\n\n3.  **Analyze Amicus Briefs (Refined):** My strategy to use amicus briefs to find new factual evidence was spectacularly validated. This brief is a trove of technical facts. The principle is refined: **Actively seek out amicus briefs from non-legal experts (e.g., technologists, scientists, economists) as they often provide the factual record on which legal arguments turn.**\n\n4.  **Strategic Sequencing of Information Gathering (Refined):** My plan to analyze petitioner-side amici first was sound, but the observation revealed a flaw in its execution. The search did not produce the expected results. This leads to a new meta-heuristic: **Analyze search failures. When a query for \"X\" returns \"Y\" or \"Not-X,\" investigate the deviation. It can reveal biases in the data source, flaws in the search tool, or, most importantly, a surprising alignment of interests in the case itself.** The fact that a tech company brief supporting the state was the top result for a search for petitioner support is a significant signal.\n\n5.  **NEW HEURISTIC \u2014 Identify and Isolate Commercially Interested Amici:** The Yoti brief is not from a civil liberties group or a legal foundation; it's from a company whose business model would benefit directly from the law being upheld. This necessitates a new evaluation framework:\n    *   **Value:** These briefs can provide invaluable, detailed expert testimony on the state of their industry/technology.\n    *   **Bias:** Their legal and policy conclusions must be treated as advocacy, not neutral analysis. Their claims about the minimal burdens or flawless privacy of their own products should be viewed with skepticism and cross-verified.\n    *   **Action:** Always scrutinize the \"Interest of Amicus Curiae\" section to diagnose potential commercial motives.\n\n6.  **The \"Technology Changed\" Argument (Evolved from Heuristic to Central Pillar):** This is no longer just a lens; it's a primary axis of the case. The key insight is that this argument is won or lost on the factual record provided by technical experts, not just on legal reasoning. In any case involving precedent and technology, I must now make it a primary goal to find the \"Yoti brief\"\u2014the expert report that details the current state of the art.\n\n7.  **The Procedural Posture is a Weapon (Strongly Validated):** Remains a key insight.\n\n8.  **\"Argument by Disgust\" (Strongly Validated):** Remains a useful heuristic for identifying rhetorical strategies.\n\n9.  **All Prior Heuristics (Stable and Integrated):** My foundational methodology remains robust. This observation has added crucial new heuristics for dealing with unexpected search results and for categorizing and evaluating different types of amicus briefs, particularly those with a direct commercial stake in the outcome."

          "task_beliefs": "My previous understanding, which was significantly bolstered by the discovery of the Yoti amicus brief, is now deepened and made far more granular by the full text of that document. The factual record supporting Texas's position is not just strong; it is now meticulously detailed, quantified, and operationalized.\n\n1.  **Central Legal Conflict (Stable):** The fundamental tension remains between applying the *Ginsberg v. New York* rational basis standard (favorable to Texas) and the *Ashcroft v. ACLU (Ashcroft II)* strict scrutiny standard (favorable to the petitioners).\n\n2.  **Respondent's Path to Victory (Vastly Clarified and Strengthened):** The Yoti brief provides the Court with a comprehensive, technically detailed \"off-ramp\" to uphold H.B. 1181 without overruling *Ashcroft II*. The abstract argument that \"technology has changed\" is now substantiated with specific, verifiable claims.\n    *   **The \"Least Restrictive Means\" Argument (Now Quantified):** The brief directly addresses the core of the strict scrutiny test. It argues that server-side age verification is now the least restrictive *effective* means, supplanting the client-side filters favored in *Ashcroft II*.\n        *   **Primary Technology\u2014Facial Age Estimation:** This is presented as the leading method. The brief provides crucial details that make it more palatable to the Court:\n            *   **Distinction from Facial Recognition:** It emphasizes that the technology estimates age from a temporarily-held image and does not identify the person, directly countering privacy-based attacks. The image is immediately deleted.\n            *   **Analogy to Real-World Practice:** The comparison to a bartender visually checking an ID or a high school principal knowing the age of students is a powerful, accessible analogy the Court could easily adopt.\n            *   **Quantitative Performance Data:** This is the most significant new information. The brief cites a September 2024 white paper claiming a **99.2% true positive rate** in identifying 13-17 year-olds as being under 21. It also provides specific, low false-positive rates for teenagers. This hard data transforms the argument from a theoretical possibility into a quantifiable reality.\n            *   **Error Management:** The concept of an \"age buffer\" (e.g., setting the pass threshold at 21 or 23 for an 18+ site) is a practical solution to the problem of statistical error margins, making the system appear more robust and thoughtfully designed.\n        *   **Technological Resilience:** The brief proactively addresses concerns about spoofing by detailing the necessity of \"liveness detection\" and \"injection attack detection\" to combat deepfakes and other circumvention methods.\n        *   **International Validation:** The mention of approval and use by regulators in Germany, the UK, and France (with tokenization coming in 2025) provides the Court with evidence that this is not a fringe or untested technology, but one gaining acceptance in other Western democracies.\n    *   **Privacy-Preserving Architecture (Detailed):** The brief explains how reusable digital IDs and \"age assurance tokens\" (anonymous cookies) can allow a user to verify their age once and then access multiple sites without repeating the process or revealing personal information. This directly counters the argument that the law imposes an undue, repetitive burden on adult speech.\n\n3.  **Petitioners' Position (Under Severe Factual Pressure):** The petitioners' reliance on *Ashcroft II* is now highly vulnerable. To succeed, they can no longer simply point to the precedent; they must now mount a successful technical rebuttal to the specific evidence provided by Yoti. Their case likely hinges on discrediting this technology as either ineffective, biased, more privacy-invasive than claimed, or economically unfeasible for smaller platforms.\n\n4.  **Prediction Model (Confidence Increased):** My prediction continues to lean more firmly toward Texas. The level of detail in the Yoti brief gives the Court a very solid factual foundation to rule that, even if strict scrutiny applies, H.B. 1181 is narrowly tailored because modern, server-side age verification is the least restrictive *effective* means of achieving the compelling interest of protecting minors. This path allows the Court to uphold the law while respecting the *stare decisis* of *Ashcroft II*, simply by following that decision's own instruction to account for technological evolution.\n\n5.  **Next Area of Uncertainty (Sharpened Focus):** The central question is now: **What is the counter-evidence?** My information-gathering must now be laser-focused on finding briefs from the petitioners' side (e.g., from the EFF, ACLU, or other tech policy groups) that directly attack the claims made in the Yoti brief. I need to find arguments about algorithmic bias, the true privacy costs of these systems, the potential for data breaches, and the economic burden on websites that are not corporate giants like Meta or TikTok. The case has evolved into a battle of expert technical facts.",
          "design_beliefs": "This observation, by providing the full text of a document I had previously only summarized, validates and refines several core heuristics about evidence analysis. It underscores the difference between knowing *that* a piece of evidence exists and understanding its specific, granular content.\n\n1.  **Adopt a Dialectical Approach (Validated):** The dialectic between legal precedent (*Ashcroft II*) and evolving factual reality (modern technology) remains the central analytical frame. This observation confirms that the synthesis is won or lost on the *quality and specificity* of the factual evidence.\n\n2.  **Prioritize Foundational Documents (Stable):** This remains the essential first step.\n\n3.  **Analyze Amicus Briefs (Refined Heuristic):** My prior heuristic to seek out non-legal expert briefs is strongly validated. This observation adds a new layer: **Prioritize quantitative data and operational details within expert briefs.** The most valuable information in the Yoti brief was not its legal argumentation, but its specific performance statistics (99.2% accuracy), its detailed descriptions of technical countermeasures (liveness detection), its list of real-world adopters (Meta, TikTok, Sony), and its evidence of international regulatory approval (Germany, UK, France). These verifiable facts are the currency the Court will use.\n\n4.  **Strategic Sequencing of Information Gathering (Stable):** The \"analyze search failures\" heuristic remains valid. The need to now find the petitioner-side rebuttal to this specific brief confirms the value of a dialectical search strategy.\n\n5.  **Identify and Isolate Commercially Interested Amici (Refined Heuristic):** My previous heuristic to view these briefs with skepticism is correct, but this observation adds crucial nuance. **Commercially interested amici are often the *only* source for ground-truth industry data.** Their commercial motive is precisely what gives them access to the performance metrics, client lists, and R&D details that are most useful. The refined strategy is to:\n    *   **Extract:** Pull out all specific, quantitative, and verifiable factual claims.\n    *   **Discount:** Heavily discount all legal conclusions, policy arguments, and qualitative self-assessments (e.g., \"our system is seamless and privacy-perfect\").\n    *   **Isolate:** Treat the extracted facts as raw data to be tested against counter-arguments from opposing amici.\n\n6.  **The \"Technology Changed\" Argument (Evolved and Deepened):** This is the central pillar of the case. The key insight is that a successful \"technology changed\" argument requires a party to provide the Court with a complete, self-contained \"off-ramp.\" The Yoti brief is a masterclass in this: it gives the Court the facts, the data, the reassuring analogies, and the international context needed to feel confident in making a fact-based distinction from a 25-year-old precedent.\n\n7.  **NEW HEURISTIC \u2014 The Power of Framing and Analogy:** The brief's success is not just in its data, but in its framing. The analogy of facial age estimation to a \"bartender\" or \"high school principal\" is a powerful rhetorical tool that domesticates a potentially scary technology. The careful distinction between \"age estimation\" and \"facial recognition\" is a critical piece of legal and public-relations framing. **Heuristic:** In cases involving novel technology, identify the analogies and framing language used by the parties. The frame that the Court finds most compelling or intuitive may dictate the outcome.\n\n8.  **All Prior Heuristics (Stable and Integrated):** My methodology is becoming more robust. I have moved from simply identifying types of arguments to understanding how to evaluate the quality of the evidence supporting them, particularly in the context of technologically complex cases."

The beliefs are internally consistent and well-integrated, with clear links between task understanding and design adaptations, supporting a high coherence rating (0.95). The information density is very high, with detailed factual claims, strategic heuristics, and meta-level reflections all present, justifying a 0.9 rating. Confidence is high given the clarity and depth of reasoning, though slightly tempered by the acknowledged uncertainty about missing counter-evidence.",

ACLU (Ashcroft II), 542 U.S. 656 (2004), \nthe \nCourt \nconsidered \na \ncontent-based \nspeech \nrestriction on sexually explicit materials on the \nInternet that Congress deemed harmful to minors. In \nconsidering this question, the Court assumed that \ncertain protected speech may be regulated, with the \nkey consideration being determining the least \nrestrictive alternative that can be used to achieve that \ngoal. In Ashcroft II, blocking and filtering software \nwas found to be the least restrictive alternative. In \nthis case, age verification technology is proposed as \nthe least restrictive alternative to achieving Texas\u2019s \nuncontested goal of protecting minors from obscene \ncontent on the Internet. \nThe Court in Ashcroft II conducted an in-depth \nanalysis of the viability and effectiveness of filtering \nsoftware circa February 1999\u2014over 25 years ago. The \nCourt found that this technological solution was the \nleast restrictive means of regulating Internet \nobscenity, with the crucial caveat that \u201cit is \nreasonable to assume that other technological \ndevelopments important to the First Amendment \nanalysis have also occurred during that time.\u201d Id. at \n671. \nThis \namicus \nbrief \nis \nabout \n\u201ctechnological \ndevelopments important to the First Amendment \nanalysis,\u201d acknowledging the Court\u2019s finding that \u201cthe \ntechnology of the Internet evolves at a rapid pace.\u201d Id. \nIn this case, the District Court soundly rejected age \nverification technology in favor of content filtering \nsoftware, while the Fifth Circuit held that Texas\u2019s \n\n \n4 \n\u201cage \nverification \nrequirement \nlikely \npasses \nconstitutional \nmuster \nunder \nthe \nrational-basis \nstandard in Ginsberg.\u201d Pet.App.27a. \nUnderstanding \nage \nverification \ntechnologies \nis \nessential to deciding whether their application is the \nleast \nrestrictive \nalternative \nunder \nthe \nFirst \nAmendment. \nARGUMENT \nI. \nAge Verification Technology is the Least \nRestrictive Alternative and is Narrowly \nTailored to Achieve Texas\u2019s Well-Founded \nGoal of Protecting Minors from Obscene \nContent on the Internet \nThis brief outlines practical examples of how current \nage verification technology (also known as age \nassurance technology) is working today, focusing on \nartificial intelligence (AI) driven facial age estimation. \nAI facial age estimation is the most popular age \nverification technology with individuals and the most \nprevalent approach by volume. It does not require \nusing an identity document or other identity data, nor \ndoes it require using facial recognition technology. No \ndatabase is created; no images are stored. The \nalgorithm does not learn anything from each \nadditional age check undertaken. \nYoti Ltd., a worldwide leader in age verification, offers \na wide range of approaches, and has undertaken over \n700 million age checks. Yoti is therefore uniquely \nqualified to explain the ease of use, accuracy, \naffordability, security, effectiveness, and accessibility, \nincluding details on how AI-driven facial age \n\n \n5 \nestimation \nmeets \nrigorous \ndata \nprotection \nrequirements to preserve privacy. This brief details \nexamples of how and where this low-friction \ntechnology is already operating globally at scale with \nleading web platforms. \nEvery month, AI-driven facial age estimation \ntechnology already enables tens of millions of adults \nto verify their age in about one second. The facial \nimage is not stored and there is no reliance on any \nidentity documentation. This technology enables \nplatforms to easily distinguish an adult from a minor \nat a global scale and in the volumes required for global \nplatforms such as Meta. \nWith the user\u2019s consent, Yoti can store the results of a \npreviously completed facial age estimation on the \nuser\u2019s device as a reusable digital ID or wallet. This \ndigital ID or wallet can then be utilized to access any \nwebsite containing adult content. \nTaking this technology one step further, reusable \napproaches, termed \u2018tokens,\u2019 are now available so \nrepeat visitors to an age-gated website, such as adult \ncontent websites, can prove their age once and then \ncontinue to use the generated age verification token \nindefinitely. The French government is the first \ngovernment to issue guidelines authorizing the use of \ntokens as an appropriate method of age verification, \nbeginning when age verification for adult content \ncomes into force in France in January 2025.12 \n \n12 https://www.arcom.fr/nos-ressources/espace-juridique/textes-\njuridiques/referentiel-technique-sur-la-verification-de-lage-\npour-la-protection-des-mineurs-contre-la-pornographie-en-ligne \n\n \n6 \nThere is a range of fallback options and exciting new \npossibilities for how visitors to age-gated websites can \nprove their age and only share their adult status, \nwhile ensuring privacy and security across platforms \nand websites. \nA. \nAge Verification Technology Does \nNot Impose Categorically Different \nBurdens on Adults and is Akin to \nIn-Person Age Verification \nAt a bar, bartenders routinely inspect an individual \nand, based on an initial estimation of their age, decide \nwhether to request a physical identification document \nsuch as a driver's license. To complete manual age \nverification, a government-issued identity document \nneeds to be reviewed to determine whether it is a bona \nfide document, whether the image of the person in the \ndocument matches the person presenting it, and check \nthe date of birth to ascertain if the person is old \nenough to consume alcohol. \nIn today\u2019s online world, platforms are already \nharnessing a range of technologies to assess age, \nfrequently working with independent age verification \nproviders. Platforms can select a range of age \nverification options to offer customers a choice and can \nmake their own determination about what range of \noptions suits their customers, accounting for different \nmarkets, regulatory requirements, and demographics. \nOne technological method emulates the human ability \nto estimate age, as demonstrated by the bartender \nexample of someone with years of experience \ndiscerning adults from minors \u2013 this is facial age \nestimate. \n\n \n7 \nSome age verification methods build on the physical \nreview of the document model by technologically \nchecking the document\u2019s authenticity and then \nchecking that the person presenting it is, in fact, the \nrightful owner. \nThis technology typically utilizes ID document \ndatabases to determine if the format of the document \nbeing presented is authentic, liveness detection to \nensure that the person presenting the document is \nalive, and face matching to compare the person \npresenting the document to the face on the document. \nIn addition, depending on the circumstances, it may \nbe necessary to verify individuals using data points \nfrom authoritative sources such as department of \nmotor vehicle databases, voter registration records, or \ncredit reference databases. \nIt is common for visitors of adult content websites to \nvisit numerous sites over several hours. Since it is \ninconvenient and excessive for such users to undergo \nage verification every time they access adult websites, \nthe age verification technology industry has developed \nreusable tokens that allow users to repeatedly visit \nadult content sites without undergoing repeated age \nverification checks. \nThe typical adult content site consists of an initial \n\u2018landing page\u2019 that can offer several types of age \nverification options, enabling the consumer to pick the \none they prefer. Some methods may involve just one \nor two clicks and take just one or two seconds, \nequivalent to or less than the time it takes a bartender \nto do a visual estimation and ask an individual to dig \nout their ID from their wallet, hand it over, and \npresent it for inspection. \n\n \n8 \nCurrent age verification methods include: \n1. \nEstimating age from a user\u2019s \nfacial image using AI facial \nage estimation technology \nIn everyday life, we are all human age estimators; we \nsubconsciously assess the ages of those we encounter, \ndrawing on our lived experience. Consider a long-\ntenured high school principal. His experience dealing \nwith teenagers would make him more accurate than \nthe average adult at differentiating those under 18 \nfrom those over 18. \nThe most developed age estimation approach, which \nhas been around for over a decade, utilizes a facial \nimage. This image-based technology was initially \nreviewed by NIST over a decade ago and is now part \nof an ongoing NIST benchmarking assessment13 and \nis currently under review by nationally accredited \naudit bodies such as the Age Check Certification \nScheme (ACCS)14 with well-established companies \nsuch as Google, Fujitsu, Idemia providing this service. \nBased on NIST data, these models are likely to be \naccurate within one to three years of the individual\u2019s \nage, depending on the age range. Specifically, the \naccuracy for younger individuals is approximately 1 to \n1.5 years, whereas the accuracy for older individuals \nis around 2-4 years. There is higher accuracy for \nyounger versus older people given that physical \nappearance is impacted over time in relation to the \n \n13 https://pages.nist.gov/frvt/html/frvt_age_estimation.html \n14 See https://accscheme.com/ and \nhttps://accscheme.com/registry/ \n\n \n9 \nindividual\u2019s lived experience. The error rate increases \nwith age, as well. \nWhen a visitor arrives on an adult website landing \npage, the request to prove age may appear in a new \nwindow or a pop-up frame. Most adult content users \naccess websites using mobile devices and are asked to \ntake a photo using their phone\u2019s camera. Desktop \nusers can do the same via their laptop webcam. \nFacial \nage \nestimation \ntechnology \ndetermines \nsomeone\u2019s age using a facial image. The user simply \nlooks at the camera on their device, positions their \nface in the oval shape provided, and takes their photo. \nThe image is then analyzed by an algorithm trained \nto determine age by analyzing facial features from a \ndiverse training set of images where the actual age \nwas known in months and years. \nTo the software model, the new image presented is \nsimply a pattern of pixels, and the pixels are numbers. \nFacial age estimation technology has been trained to \nspot patterns in numbers and pinpoint how people of \na particular age appear in those number patterns. The \nfacial age estimation process usually takes less than \none second. It can produce either a yes/no result on \nwhether the individual in the image meets a \ndesignated age threshold or an estimated age. The \nimage is assessed directly and there is no need to store \nit, so nothing is stored, ensuring the visitor\u2019s privacy. \nIf the visitor meets the age required (e.g., 18+), the age \nestimation technology confirms to the adult website \nthat the user can proceed, and the user can then \naccess the adult content on the website. \n\n \n10 \nA website operator can require an \u2018age buffer\u2019 in years \nabove the age of access. For example, the website \noperator could decide that if the age of access is 18 \nyears and a method is accurate to within 1 to 1.5 \nyears, then this method can be used by all visitors who \nare, for instance, two, three, or five years older than \nthe necessary age, translating to 20, 21 or 23 years \nold. Visitors within this buffer\u2014below 20 in this \nexample\u2014will need to use an additional age \nverification check to help pinpoint their age. \nIn Yoti\u2019s publicly accessible white papers, we \nregularly publish the mean absolute errors, false \npositives, and false negatives for each age group \nacross gender and skin tone. In our most recent white \npaper, published in September 2024, the Yoti \nalgorithm produces a true positive rate for thirteen- to \nseventeen-year-old minors as correctly estimated as \nunder age twenty-one 99.2% of the time. The false \npositives rate reveals that under 1% of fourteen to \nseventeen-year-olds incorrectly judged to be over age \ntwenty-one as 0.03% for fourteen-year-olds, 0.34% for \nfifteen-year-olds, 0.73% for sixteen-year-olds and \n2.43% of seventeen-year-olds.15 \nUsing modern age verification technology, all adults \nabove age twenty or twenty-one can easily and \nsecurely assert their adult status in a privacy-ensured \nway in around one second. This method is highly \naccurate against different ages and skin tones, where \nthe technology is consistently trained at scale and \n \n15 https://www.yoti.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Yoti-Age-\nEstimation-White-Paper-September-2024-PUBLIC.pdf page 31. \n\n \n11 \nusing artificial intelligence is constantly improving \nover time. \nTo achieve a high level of assurance, facial age \nestimation should always be used in combination with \nliveness detection\u2013 including both presentation and \ninjection attack detection\u2013 and be subject to \ncontinuous independent testing and monitoring. \nLiveness checks prevent people from using a photo, \nvideo, or mask instead of taking a live photo. Facial \ninjection attack detection ensures that the image \nbeing analyzed originates from a live source, such as \nthe device camera, and not from a fraudulent or pre-\nrecorded \ninput. \nThis \ntechnique \nverifies \nthe \nauthenticity of the face by distinguishing between \nreal-time facial data and injected, manipulated, or \nreplayed images, helping to prevent spoofing or \nunauthorized access. \nWith the rise of generative AI technology and \ndeepfakes to circumvent age verification checks, the \nability to prevent direct and indirect injection attacks \nis also required.16 Website operators must identify \nand prevent sophisticated injection attacks, ensuring \nthat the images captured during a verification process \nare genuine and remain untampered with.17 \nThe ongoing large scale NIST evaluation uses over 11 \nmillion data points and provides scientific certainty \nfor businesses and governments that facial age \nestimation is an accurate, fair, and privacy-preserving \n \n16 https://www.yoti.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Yoti-How-\nto-combat-Generative-AI-and-deepfakes-white-paper.pdf \n17 https://www.yoti.com/blog/yoti-releases-white-paper-\ndetailing-approach-to-combating-generative-ai-and-deepfakes/ \n\n \n12 \nage assurance solution.18 Audit bodies such as ACCS \nhave been auditing facial age estimation since 2020. \nThey also provide testing, using high-quality test \nimages captured from mobile phones, to provide \ntesting conditions closer to those of adult content and \nsocial media companies. \nFacial age estimation has been approved by a range of \nregulators as a method for age verification to access \nadult content: the German regulators (KJM and FSM) \nhave been using it since 2021 with a 5-year buffer. The \nFrench content and data protection regulators (Arcom \nand CNIL) and the UK data protection and content \nregulators (ICO and OFCOM) clearly state it as an \nappropriate method. \n2. \nDocument-based verification \nusing a physical identity \ndocument \nFor individuals within a defined buffer zone\u2014for \nexample between the ages of eighteen and twenty-\none\u2014other forms of verification, such as document-\nbased verification, can be utilized as a fallback or \nsupplemental method of establishing age. \nDocument-based verification requires assurances that \nthe actual owner of the document is the person \nproviding the document. So, in the same way a \nthorough bartender will carefully compare the \ndocument to the person presenting it, effective online \ndocument-based age verification requires document \nauthenticity checks, face matching, and liveness \nverification. Using these three steps, website \n \n18 https://pages.nist.gov/frvt/reports/aev/fate_aev_report.pdf \n\n \n13 \noperators have a high level of assurance that the \ndocument is authentic, belongs to the right person, \nand that the document owner is the person presenting \nthe document at that discrete moment in time. \nDocument-based age verification technology and \nhuman analysts in Yoti\u2019s 24-hour data security \ncenters review documents to detect a range of fraud \nvectors, including fake, tampered-with, borrowed, or \ncounterfeit documents. \nSharing an identity document might be perceived as \ndisclosing more individually identifying details, such \nas name, nationality, and address, alongside a live \nfacial scan; however, in actuality, just the anonymized \nage attribute or \u201cage over\u201d such as \u201c18\u201d is shared with \nthe adult content site. \nThe Yoti terms of service and industry best practices, \nalong with legal and regulatory requirements in the \nUK and EU, require that only the age result is \ntransferred and that any personal data captured as \npart of a one-time upload of an identity document \nverification check is promptly deleted after the age \nverification check is completed. \n3. \nChecking against databases, \ncredit reference agencies, \nmobile phone operators, and \nother semi-public data \nsources \nThere are a number of techniques that have long been \nused for Know Your Customer checks in financial \nservices and gambling, and as in the example above, \nthey can also be utilized to determine whether a user \nis an adult or a minor. \n\n \n14 \n4. \nReusable digital identity apps \nRepeatedly undergoing age verification checks is not \nonly tiresome, but it can limit users\u2019 engagement and \naccess to legally accessible content. Especially for \nusers close in age to legal adulthood, a more \npermanent method of assuring age is possible by \nusing a digital identity app that allows them to \nestablish their age once and then utilize this proof of \nage in many different contexts, on many different \nwebsites and platforms. \nIn addition to storing document-based verification, a \ndigital ID app can utilize facial age estimation to \nvalidate age once and then share that verification \nwhen required across the Internet. In the physical \nworld, a location might allow visitors seeking access \nto an adult venue to scan a QR code and share a \nverified age estimation via a reusable digital identity \napp. \nIn the online world, a digital identity app simply \ncertifies that the visitor is an adult through a simple \n\u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d check. Nothing further is shared with the \nwebsite operator, and no personal information is \nrevealed, ensuring complete privacy for the user. \n5. \nAge assurance tokens in \nwhich validation on one \nwebsite is transferrable to \nanother website \nAll the above age assurance options can be \nindependently assessed, accredited, and tokenized. \nWebsites can determine which methods they accept, \nwhether to tokenize, and the duration of the tokens. \n\n \n15 \nUsing tokens decreases the costs for relying parties \nand can further reduce any burden by the visitor to \nkeep verifying their age at each adult site they visit. \nAge assurance tokens allow a visitor to determine \ntheir age once using any of the methods above and \nthen use that same verification repeatedly across \nwebsites. An anonymous cookie is added to their \nbrowser which is then accessed by subsequent \nwebsites. Tokens don\u2019t contain any identifiable \ninformation, just the age verification result and \ninformation about how the check was performed. \nTokens can be stored in a confidential age verification \naccount, cached, and utilized over and over again \nindefinitely. \nUsers can pass their age tokens to another browser or, \nafter clearing their cache, by logging on to their age \nverification account. Once cached or re-cached, users \ncan freely visit other sites that accept the token \ncriteria. If a user visits a site with different criteria, \nsuch as a higher age threshold or one requiring a more \nrecently issued token, the user will be asked to \nundertake a new age verification. \nThe information shared with the relying party is the \nsum of the token\u2019s information, as detailed above. This \ncomprises the method of age assurance used, the type \nof age recorded\u2014such as age over, age under, or age \nrange\u2014the issuer of the age token, the type of liveness \ncheck performed, the type of authenticity check \nperformed, and the time and date the check was \nperformed. \n\n \n16 \nB. \nAge Verification Technology Does \nNot Unreasonably Implicate or \nIntrude Upon the Privacy of Adults \nUsing modern age verification technology, as soon as \na visitor\u2019s age is estimated, their facial image is \ndeleted, ensuring their privacy at all times. Visitors \ndo not need to provide personal details like their name \nor date of birth or share any identity documents. The \ntechnology is specifically designed not to identify \nanyone. Unlike facial-recognition technology, age \nverification technology estimates someone\u2019s age \nwithout identity matching that person or acq\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

ACLU (Ashcroft II), 542 U.S. 656 (2004), \nthe \nCourt \nconsidered \na \ncontent-based \nspeech \nrestriction on sexually explicit materials on the \nInternet that Congress deemed harmful to minors. In \nconsidering this question, the Court assumed that \ncertain protected speech may be regulated, with the \nkey consideration being determining the least \nrestrictive alternative that can be used to achieve that \ngoal. In Ashcroft II, blocking and filtering software \nwas found to be the least restrictive alternative. In \nthis case, age verification technology is proposed as \nthe least restrictive alternative to achieving Texas\u2019s \nuncontested goal of protecting minors from obscene \ncontent on the Internet. \nThe Court in Ashcroft II conducted an in-depth \nanalysis of the viability and effectiveness of filtering \nsoftware circa February 1999\u2014over 25 years ago. The \nCourt found that this technological solution was the \nleast restrictive means of regulating Internet \nobscenity, with the crucial caveat that \u201cit is \nreasonable to assume that other technological \ndevelopments important to the First Amendment \nanalysis have also occurred during that time.\u201d Id. at \n671. \nThis \namicus \nbrief \nis \nabout \n\u201ctechnological \ndevelopments important to the First Amendment \nanalysis,\u201d acknowledging the Court\u2019s finding that \u201cthe \ntechnology of the Internet evolves at a rapid pace.\u201d Id. \nIn this case, the District Court soundly rejected age \nverification technology in favor of content filtering \nsoftware, while the Fifth Circuit held that Texas\u2019s \n\n \n4 \n\u201cage \nverification \nrequirement \nlikely \npasses \nconstitutional \nmuster \nunder \nthe \nrational-basis \nstandard in Ginsberg.\u201d Pet.App.27a. \nUnderstanding \nage \nverification \ntechnologies \nis \nessential to deciding whether their application is the \nleast \nrestrictive \nalternative \nunder \nthe \nFirst \nAmendment. \nARGUMENT \nI. \nAge Verification Technology is the Least \nRestrictive Alternative and is Narrowly \nTailored to Achieve Texas\u2019s Well-Founded \nGoal of Protecting Minors from Obscene \nContent on the Internet \nThis brief outlines practical examples of how current \nage verification technology (also known as age \nassurance technology) is working today, focusing on \nartificial intelligence (AI) driven facial age estimation. \nAI facial age estimation is the most popular age \nverification technology with individuals and the most \nprevalent approach by volume. It does not require \nusing an identity document or other identity data, nor \ndoes it require using facial recognition technology. No \ndatabase is created; no images are stored. The \nalgorithm does not learn anything from each \nadditional age check undertaken. \nYoti Ltd., a worldwide leader in age verification, offers \na wide range of approaches, and has undertaken over \n700 million age checks. Yoti is therefore uniquely \nqualified to explain the ease of use, accuracy, \naffordability, security, effectiveness, and accessibility, \nincluding details on how AI-driven facial age \n\n \n5 \nestimation \nmeets \nrigorous \ndata \nprotection \nrequirements to preserve privacy. This brief details \nexamples of how and where this low-friction \ntechnology is already operating globally at scale with \nleading web platforms. \nEvery month, AI-driven facial age estimation \ntechnology already enables tens of millions of adults \nto verify their age in about one second. The facial \nimage is not stored and there is no reliance on any \nidentity documentation. This technology enables \nplatforms to easily distinguish an adult from a minor \nat a global scale and in the volumes required for global \nplatforms such as Meta. \nWith the user\u2019s consent, Yoti can store the results of a \npreviously completed facial age estimation on the \nuser\u2019s device as a reusable digital ID or wallet. This \ndigital ID or wallet can then be utilized to access any \nwebsite containing adult content. \nTaking this technology one step further, reusable \napproaches, termed \u2018tokens,\u2019 are now available so \nrepeat visitors to an age-gated website, such as adult \ncontent websites, can prove their age once and then \ncontinue to use the generated age verification token \nindefinitely. The French government is the first \ngovernment to issue guidelines authorizing the use of \ntokens as an appropriate method of age verification, \nbeginning when age verification for adult content \ncomes into force in France in January 2025.12 \n \n12 https://www.arcom.fr/nos-ressources/espace-juridique/textes-\njuridiques/referentiel-technique-sur-la-verification-de-lage-\npour-la-protection-des-mineurs-contre-la-pornographie-en-ligne \n\n \n6 \nThere is a range of fallback options and exciting new \npossibilities for how visitors to age-gated websites can \nprove their age and only share their adult status, \nwhile ensuring privacy and security across platforms \nand websites. \nA. \nAge Verification Technology Does \nNot Impose Categorically Different \nBurdens on Adults and is Akin to \nIn-Person Age Verification \nAt a bar, bartenders routinely inspect an individual \nand, based on an initial estimation of their age, decide \nwhether to request a physical identification document \nsuch as a driver's license. To complete manual age \nverification, a government-issued identity document \nneeds to be reviewed to determine whether it is a bona \nfide document, whether the image of the person in the \ndocument matches the person presenting it, and check \nthe date of birth to ascertain if the person is old \nenough to consume alcohol. \nIn today\u2019s online world, platforms are already \nharnessing a range of technologies to assess age, \nfrequently working with independent age verification \nproviders. Platforms can select a range of age \nverification options to offer customers a choice and can \nmake their own determination about what range of \noptions suits their customers, accounting for different \nmarkets, regulatory requirements, and demographics. \nOne technological method emulates the human ability \nto estimate age, as demonstrated by the bartender \nexample of someone with years of experience \ndiscerning adults from minors \u2013 this is facial age \nestimate. \n\n \n7 \nSome age verification methods build on the physical \nreview of the document model by technologically \nchecking the document\u2019s authenticity and then \nchecking that the person presenting it is, in fact, the \nrightful owner. \nThis technology typically utilizes ID document \ndatabases to determine if the format of the document \nbeing presented is authentic, liveness detection to \nensure that the person presenting the document is \nalive, and face matching to compare the person \npresenting the document to the face on the document. \nIn addition, depending on the circumstances, it may \nbe necessary to verify individuals using data points \nfrom authoritative sources such as department of \nmotor vehicle databases, voter registration records, or \ncredit reference databases. \nIt is common for visitors of adult content websites to \nvisit numerous sites over several hours. Since it is \ninconvenient and excessive for such users to undergo \nage verification every time they access adult websites, \nthe age verification technology industry has developed \nreusable tokens that allow users to repeatedly visit \nadult content sites without undergoing repeated age \nverification checks. \nThe typical adult content site consists of an initial \n\u2018landing page\u2019 that can offer several types of age \nverification options, enabling the consumer to pick the \none they prefer. Some methods may involve just one \nor two clicks and take just one or two seconds, \nequivalent to or less than the time it takes a bartender \nto do a visual estimation and ask an individual to dig \nout their ID from their wallet, hand it over, and \npresent it for inspection. \n\n \n8 \nCurrent age verification methods include: \n1. \nEstimating age from a user\u2019s \nfacial image using AI facial \nage estimation technology \nIn everyday life, we are all human age estimators; we \nsubconsciously assess the ages of those we encounter, \ndrawing on our lived experience. Consider a long-\ntenured high school principal. His experience dealing \nwith teenagers would make him more accurate than \nthe average adult at differentiating those under 18 \nfrom those over 18. \nThe most developed age estimation approach, which \nhas been around for over a decade, utilizes a facial \nimage. This image-based technology was initially \nreviewed by NIST over a decade ago and is now part \nof an ongoing NIST benchmarking assessment13 and \nis currently under review by nationally accredited \naudit bodies such as the Age Check Certification \nScheme (ACCS)14 with well-established companies \nsuch as Google, Fujitsu, Idemia providing this service. \nBased on NIST data, these models are likely to be \naccurate within one to three years of the individual\u2019s \nage, depending on the age range. Specifically, the \naccuracy for younger individuals is approximately 1 to \n1.5 years, whereas the accuracy for older individuals \nis around 2-4 years. There is higher accuracy for \nyounger versus older people given that physical \nappearance is impacted over time in relation to the \n \n13 https://pages.nist.gov/frvt/html/frvt_age_estimation.html \n14 See https://accscheme.com/ and \nhttps://accscheme.com/registry/ \n\n \n9 \nindividual\u2019s lived experience. The error rate increases \nwith age, as well. \nWhen a visitor arrives on an adult website landing \npage, the request to prove age may appear in a new \nwindow or a pop-up frame. Most adult content users \naccess websites using mobile devices and are asked to \ntake a photo using their phone\u2019s camera. Desktop \nusers can do the same via their laptop webcam. \nFacial \nage \nestimation \ntechnology \ndetermines \nsomeone\u2019s age using a facial image. The user simply \nlooks at the camera on their device, positions their \nface in the oval shape provided, and takes their photo. \nThe image is then analyzed by an algorithm trained \nto determine age by analyzing facial features from a \ndiverse training set of images where the actual age \nwas known in months and years. \nTo the software model, the new image presented is \nsimply a pattern of pixels, and the pixels are numbers. \nFacial age estimation technology has been trained to \nspot patterns in numbers and pinpoint how people of \na particular age appear in those number patterns. The \nfacial age estimation process usually takes less than \none second. It can produce either a yes/no result on \nwhether the individual in the image meets a \ndesignated age threshold or an estimated age. The \nimage is assessed directly and there is no need to store \nit, so nothing is stored, ensuring the visitor\u2019s privacy. \nIf the visitor meets the age required (e.g., 18+), the age \nestimation technology confirms to the adult website \nthat the user can proceed, and the user can then \naccess the adult content on the website. \n\n \n10 \nA website operator can require an \u2018age buffer\u2019 in years \nabove the age of access. For example, the website \noperator could decide that if the age of access is 18 \nyears and a method is accurate to within 1 to 1.5 \nyears, then this method can be used by all visitors who \nare, for instance, two, three, or five years older than \nthe necessary age, translating to 20, 21 or 23 years \nold. Visitors within this buffer\u2014below 20 in this \nexample\u2014will need to use an additional age \nverification check to help pinpoint their age. \nIn Yoti\u2019s publicly accessible white papers, we \nregularly publish the mean absolute errors, false \npositives, and false negatives for each age group \nacross gender and skin tone. In our most recent white \npaper, published in September 2024, the Yoti \nalgorithm produces a true positive rate for thirteen- to \nseventeen-year-old minors as correctly estimated as \nunder age twenty-one 99.2% of the time. The false \npositives rate reveals that under 1% of fourteen to \nseventeen-year-olds incorrectly judged to be over age \ntwenty-one as 0.03% for fourteen-year-olds, 0.34% for \nfifteen-year-olds, 0.73% for sixteen-year-olds and \n2.43% of seventeen-year-olds.15 \nUsing modern age verification technology, all adults \nabove age twenty or twenty-one can easily and \nsecurely assert their adult status in a privacy-ensured \nway in around one second. This method is highly \naccurate against different ages and skin tones, where \nthe technology is consistently trained at scale and \n \n15 https://www.yoti.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Yoti-Age-\nEstimation-White-Paper-September-2024-PUBLIC.pdf page 31. \n\n \n11 \nusing artificial intelligence is constantly improving \nover time. \nTo achieve a high level of assurance, facial age \nestimation should always be used in combination with \nliveness detection\u2013 including both presentation and \ninjection attack detection\u2013 and be subject to \ncontinuous independent testing and monitoring. \nLiveness checks prevent people from using a photo, \nvideo, or mask instead of taking a live photo. Facial \ninjection attack detection ensures that the image \nbeing analyzed originates from a live source, such as \nthe device camera, and not from a fraudulent or pre-\nrecorded \ninput. \nThis \ntechnique \nverifies \nthe \nauthenticity of the face by distinguishing between \nreal-time facial data and injected, manipulated, or \nreplayed images, helping to prevent spoofing or \nunauthorized access. \nWith the rise of generative AI technology and \ndeepfakes to circumvent age verification checks, the \nability to prevent direct and indirect injection attacks \nis also required.16 Website operators must identify \nand prevent sophisticated injection attacks, ensuring \nthat the images captured during a verification process \nare genuine and remain untampered with.17 \nThe ongoing large scale NIST evaluation uses over 11 \nmillion data points and provides scientific certainty \nfor businesses and governments that facial age \nestimation is an accurate, fair, and privacy-preserving \n \n16 https://www.yoti.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Yoti-How-\nto-combat-Generative-AI-and-deepfakes-white-paper.pdf \n17 https://www.yoti.com/blog/yoti-releases-white-paper-\ndetailing-approach-to-combating-generative-ai-and-deepfakes/ \n\n \n12 \nage assurance solution.18 Audit bodies such as ACCS \nhave been auditing facial age estimation since 2020. \nThey also provide testing, using high-quality test \nimages captured from mobile phones, to provide \ntesting conditions closer to those of adult content and \nsocial media companies. \nFacial age estimation has been approved by a range of \nregulators as a method for age verification to access \nadult content: the German regulators (KJM and FSM) \nhave been using it since 2021 with a 5-year buffer. The \nFrench content and data protection regulators (Arcom \nand CNIL) and the UK data protection and content \nregulators (ICO and OFCOM) clearly state it as an \nappropriate method. \n2. \nDocument-based verification \nusing a physical identity \ndocument \nFor individuals within a defined buffer zone\u2014for \nexample between the ages of eighteen and twenty-\none\u2014other forms of verification, such as document-\nbased verification, can be utilized as a fallback or \nsupplemental method of establishing age. \nDocument-based verification requires assurances that \nthe actual owner of the document is the person \nproviding the document. So, in the same way a \nthorough bartender will carefully compare the \ndocument to the person presenting it, effective online \ndocument-based age verification requires document \nauthenticity checks, face matching, and liveness \nverification. Using these three steps, website \n \n18 https://pages.nist.gov/frvt/reports/aev/fate_aev_report.pdf \n\n \n13 \noperators have a high level of assurance that the \ndocument is authentic, belongs to the right person, \nand that the document owner is the person presenting \nthe document at that discrete moment in time. \nDocument-based age verification technology and \nhuman analysts in Yoti\u2019s 24-hour data security \ncenters review documents to detect a range of fraud \nvectors, including fake, tampered-with, borrowed, or \ncounterfeit documents. \nSharing an identity document might be perceived as \ndisclosing more individually identifying details, such \nas name, nationality, and address, alongside a live \nfacial scan; however, in actuality, just the anonymized \nage attribute or \u201cage over\u201d such as \u201c18\u201d is shared with \nthe adult content site. \nThe Yoti terms of service and industry best practices, \nalong with legal and regulatory requirements in the \nUK and EU, require that only the age result is \ntransferred and that any personal data captured as \npart of a one-time upload of an identity document \nverification check is promptly deleted after the age \nverification check is completed. \n3. \nChecking against databases, \ncredit reference agencies, \nmobile phone operators, and \nother semi-public data \nsources \nThere are a number of techniques that have long been \nused for Know Your Customer checks in financial \nservices and gambling, and as in the example above, \nthey can also be utilized to determine whether a user \nis an adult or a minor. \n\n \n14 \n4. \nReusable digital identity apps \nRepeatedly undergoing age verification checks is not \nonly tiresome, but it can limit users\u2019 engagement and \naccess to legally accessible content. Especially for \nusers close in age to legal adulthood, a more \npermanent method of assuring age is possible by \nusing a digital identity app that allows them to \nestablish their age once and then utilize this proof of \nage in many different contexts, on many different \nwebsites and platforms. \nIn addition to storing document-based verification, a \ndigital ID app can utilize facial age estimation to \nvalidate age once and then share that verification \nwhen required across the Internet. In the physical \nworld, a location might allow visitors seeking access \nto an adult venue to scan a QR code and share a \nverified age estimation via a reusable digital identity \napp. \nIn the online world, a digital identity app simply \ncertifies that the visitor is an adult through a simple \n\u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d check. Nothing further is shared with the \nwebsite operator, and no personal information is \nrevealed, ensuring complete privacy for the user. \n5. \nAge assurance tokens in \nwhich validation on one \nwebsite is transferrable to \nanother website \nAll the above age assurance options can be \nindependently assessed, accredited, and tokenized. \nWebsites can determine which methods they accept, \nwhether to tokenize, and the duration of the tokens. \n\n \n15 \nUsing tokens decreases the costs for relying parties \nand can further reduce any burden by the visitor to \nkeep verifying their age at each adult site they visit. \nAge assurance tokens allow a visitor to determine \ntheir age once using any of the methods above and \nthen use that same verification repeatedly across \nwebsites. An anonymous cookie is added to their \nbrowser which is then accessed by subsequent \nwebsites. Tokens don\u2019t contain any identifiable \ninformation, just the age verification result and \ninformation about how the check was performed. \nTokens can be stored in a confidential age verification \naccount, cached, and utilized over and over again \nindefinitely. \nUsers can pass their age tokens to another browser or, \nafter clearing their cache, by logging on to their age \nverification account. Once cached or re-cached, users \ncan freely visit other sites that accept the token \ncriteria. If a user visits a site with different criteria, \nsuch as a higher age threshold or one requiring a more \nrecently issued token, the user will be asked to \nundertake a new age verification. \nThe information shared with the relying party is the \nsum of the token\u2019s information, as detailed above. This \ncomprises the method of age assurance used, the type \nof age recorded\u2014such as age over, age under, or age \nrange\u2014the issuer of the age token, the type of liveness \ncheck performed, the type of authenticity check \nperformed, and the time and date the check was \nperformed. \n\n \n16 \nB. \nAge Verification Technology Does \nNot Unreasonably Implicate or \nIntrude Upon the Privacy of Adults \nUsing modern age verification technology, as soon as \na visitor\u2019s age is estimated, their facial image is \ndeleted, ensuring their privacy at all times. Visitors \ndo not need to provide personal details like their name \nor date of birth or share any identity documents. The \ntechnology is specifically designed not to identify \nanyone. Unlike facial-recognition technology, age \nverification technology estimates someone\u2019s age \nwithout identity matching that person or acquiring \nany details from them other than the facial image \nwhich is instantly assessed and then is no longer \nneeded, and therefore does not need to be stored.19 \nC. \nAge Verification Technology is \nCurrently being Successfully \nUtilized Worldwide \nMany of the largest and most successful social media, \nadult content websites, and gaming platforms already \nuse age verification technology, with millions of \nchecks being conducted monthly. \n \n \n \n \n19 https://ico.org.uk/media/for-\norganisations/documents/4020427/yoti-sandbox-\nexit_report_20220522.pdf \n\n \n17 \n \nExamples include: \nMeta, \nincluding \nFacebook \nDating, \nInstagram, and, more recently, Instagram \nTeen Accounts, utilizes age verification \ntechnology to support age-appropriate \naccess to these services. When Facebook \nDating and Instagram detect a user \nattempting to change their date of birth \nfrom under 18 to over 18, they deploy Yoti\u2019s \nfacial age estimation as one of the ways the \nperson can establish that they are an adult. \nThis tool has been deployed by Meta since \n2022. Meta recently introduced Instagram \nTeen \nAccounts \nwith \nbuilt-in \ndefault \nprotections limiting who can contact and \nthe content teen users can access. Teens \nunder sixteen need an adult\u2019s permission to \nuse less protective settings. For teen users \nwho want to switch to an adult account, \nInstagram uses Yoti facial age estimation, \namong other tools, to establish eligibility \nfor such an account. \n\n \n18 \nOnlyFans, \na \nsubscription-based \nsocial \nmedia platform for adults where both \ncreators and subscribers must be over \neighteen, \ndeploys \nage \nverification \ntechnology in many countries to ensure \nthat those engaging with the platform are \nadults. \nYubo, \na \nlive-streaming \nsocial \nmedia \nplatform with almost 60 million users, \noffers a service for adults and a separate \nservice for thirteen to seventeen-year-olds. \nSince 2022, Yubo has been using facial age \nestimation as its first point of contact to \nensure that users are old enough and \nprovided access to the proper content. Yubo \nemploys a fallback option for users close to \nage 18, such as using the Yoti reusable \ndigital ID app or a one-time document \nsubmission. \nD. \nTexas Can Impose a Content-Based \nSpeech Restriction on Sexually \nExplicit Materials on the Internet \nEven if it Results in a Cost to the \nWebsites and Platforms Hosting the \nContent \nCost is an understated but important issue in deciding \nthe least restrictive means of regulating Internet \nobscenity. The end user almost always bears the cost \nof blocking and filtering software, while the website \nprofiting from obscenity and adult content almost \nalways bears the cost of age verification technology. \nCost-shifting refers to allocating a policy or practice\u2019s \n\n \n19 \nexpenses or financial burdens to one party while \nallowing others to shirk or reduce these costs. \nUnder the First Amendment, the government cannot \nimpose a financial burden on speakers based on the \ncontent of their speech. Rosenberger v. Rector & \nVisitors of Univ. of Virginia, 515 U.S. 819, 828 (1995). \nHowever, imposing a cost is permissible if it is \n\u201cdesigned to meet the expenses incident to the \nadministration of the law.\u201d Forsyth Cnty., Ga. v. \nNationalist Movement, 505 U.S. 123, 129 n. 8 (1992). \nOne example is requiring fees and paid permits for \ngroups \nand \nindividuals \nexercising \ntheir \nFirst \nAmendment right to protest. Concerning permit fees, \nthe Supreme Court has ruled that costs must be \nreasonable and not prohibitively expensive, that they \ncannot be based on the content of the speech or the \nviewpoint of the demonstrators, and that they \ntypically cover administrative expenses such as \nprocessing the permit application, coordinating with \nlaw enforcement, and ensuring public safety during \nthe event. See e.g. iMatter Utah v. Njord, 774 F.3d \n1258 (10th Cir. 2014); Surita v. Hyde, 665 F.3d 860 \n(7th Cir. 2011). \nThe same principles can be applied when online adult \ncontent providers require age verification. In the case \nof age verification, cost-shifting legitimately places \nthe cost of age verification technology on the providers \nof adult content rather than on the consumers who \nwould otherwise incur costs by having to install and \nmaintain monitoring and filtering software on their \nown devices. Since the costs of operating and \nmaintaining modern age verification technology are \nno longer prohibitively expensive or unreasonable, \n\n \n20 \nrequiring adult websites to incur these costs does not \nviolate the websites\u2019 First Amendment rights.20  \nFurthermore, this cost evaluation does not consider \nthe actual negative societal costs when minors can \naccess explicit adult content, nor does it consider the \nundue burden that parents incur for the entire \nresponsibility of filtering, monitoring, and installing \nmonitoring and filtering software on their children\u2019s \nand shared family devices. \nWhen it comes to obscenity, the government has a \nmuch wider latitude to determine and impose costs, \nboth tangible and intangible. In Paris Adult Theatre I \nv. Slaton, 413 U.S. 49, 57\u201358 (1973), the Court held \nthat \u201cthere are legitimate state interests at stake in \nstemming the tide of commercialized obscenity, even \nassuming it is feasible to enforce effective safeguards \nagainst exposure to juveniles and to passersby. Rights \nand interests \u2018other than those of the advocates are \ninvolved.\u2019 These include the interest of the public in \nthe quality of life and the total community \nenvironment, the tone of commerce in the great city \ncenters, and, possibly, the public safety itself.\u201d \nInternal citations removed. \n \n \n \n20 See Declaration of Tony Allen: \u201cYoti state that their Age \nVerification Service (AVS) pricing ranges between $0.03 (for \nlarge volumes e.g. circa 100 M, $0.10 for circa 5M checks and \n$0.31 for lower volumes, one time account based checks e.g. \nunder 100,000). They also offer free, $0.0 shares of 18 plus \nattributes from the reusable Yoti digital identity app\u2026.\u201d \nJ.A.201. \n\n \n21 \nCONCLUSION \n\u201cUnderstandably those who entertain an absolutist \nview of the First Amendment find it uncomfortable to \nexplain why rights of association, speech, and press \nshould be severely restrained in the marketplace of \ngoods and money, but not in the marketplace of \npornography.\u201d Paris Adult Theatre I v. Slaton, 413 \nU.S. 49, 60\u201362 (1973). \nConsidering the arguments presented, it is evident \nthat \ncurrent \nage \nverification \ntechnologies, \nparticularly AI facial age estimation, offer practical, \nprivacy-preserving, and scalable solutions for online \nage verification. This technology provides a secure \nand efficient method for websites and platforms to \ncomply with legal requirements while respecting user \nprivacy. The methods outlined, including the reuse of \nage tokens and digital identity apps, further reduce \nuser friction while maintaining high accuracy and \nsecurity at a low cost. \nGiven the demonstrated effectiveness of these \ntechnologies in protecting minors and enabling adults \nto assert their age without unnecessary intrusion, the \nCourt should recognize that AI-driven facial age \nestimation \nsolutions \nare \nthe \nleast \nrestrictive \nalternative under the First Amendment when \nrestricting sexually explicit materials on the Internet. \nFor these reasons, Yoti Ltd. respectfully submits that \nthe Court should support the implementation of these \nadvanced age assurance technologies as a reliable \nmethod to comply with age verification requirements \nwhile also safeguarding privacy and promoting \naccessibility for all users. \n\n \n22 \nRESPECTFULLY SUBMITTED \nJAMES R.

          "task_beliefs": "My understanding of the case has not changed in substance, but my assessment of my own knowledge has become more critical. The evidence I possess is powerful but clearly one-sided, and this observation formalizes my plan to correct that imbalance.\n\n1.  **Central Legal Conflict (Stable):** The case continues to pivot on whether the Court will apply the *Ginsberg v. New York* rational basis standard or the *Ashcroft v. ACLU (Ashcroft II)* strict scrutiny standard to H.B. 1181.\n\n2.  **Respondent's Path to Victory (Strong but Uncontested):** The Yoti amicus brief provides a detailed and technically robust roadmap for the Court to uphold the Texas law. It argues that even under strict scrutiny, the law is narrowly tailored because modern server-side age verification is the least restrictive *effective* means available.\n    *   **Key Factual Claims (Stable):** The strength of this argument rests on specific, quantitative claims about facial age estimation technology: its distinction from facial recognition, its high accuracy (99.2% true positive rate for 13-17 year-olds), its privacy-preserving architecture (age tokens), its countermeasures to spoofing (liveness detection), and its validation by international regulators (Germany, UK, France).\n    *   **Analogical Power (Stable):** The comparison of the technology to a bartender checking an ID remains a potent tool for making the technology seem familiar and less intrusive.\n\n3.  **Petitioners' Position (Hypothesized but Unconfirmed):** My model of the petitioners' case remains under severe pressure from the Yoti brief's factual claims. However, I have not yet seen their rebuttal. Their success likely depends on a direct, expert-led attack on the technology's efficacy, bias, privacy implications, or economic feasibility.\n\n4.  **Prediction Model (Confidence Qualified):** While the evidence I have seen still points towards a victory for Texas, I now formally recognize that this prediction is based on an incomplete, one-sided dataset. My confidence in this prediction is therefore *provisional*. The outcome of the case hinges almost entirely on the strength of the counter-evidence that I have not yet found. The current lean towards Texas is a hypothesis to be tested, not a firm conclusion.\n\n5.  **Next Area of Uncertainty (Action Plan Formalized):** My primary goal is now to resolve the single most important uncertainty: **What is the petitioners' expert rebuttal to the technological claims made by Yoti?** This internal reasoning step has confirmed that my previous broad searches were insufficient. My information-gathering strategy is now explicitly targeted at finding amicus briefs from organizations known for their expertise in technology, privacy, and free speech, such as the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) and the ACLU, who are almost certain to have filed in support of the petitioners. The case has become a battle of dueling experts, and I have so far only heard from one side.",
          "design_beliefs": "This observation, an act of internal reasoning, provides no new external data but is critically important for refining my meta-level strategy. It demonstrates the value of pausing to assess the state of knowledge and deliberately planning the next action to address the most significant uncertainty.\n\n1.  **Adopt a Dialectical Approach (Validated and Actioned):** This heuristic is now driving my active strategy. I have identified a strong \"thesis\" (the Yoti brief) and have now formalized the need to find the \"antithesis\" (the petitioners' expert rebuttal) before I can reach a \"synthesis\" (a robust prediction). This observation marks the transition from passively receiving information to actively hunting for a specific, missing piece of the dialectic.\n\n2.  **Prioritize Foundational Documents (Stable):** Remains a core principle.\n\n3.  **Analyze Amicus Briefs (Refined):** The heuristic to prioritize quantitative data from expert briefs remains valid. This observation adds the corollary that one must actively seek out *competing* expert briefs to test the claims of the first.\n\n4.  **Strategic Sequencing of Information Gathering (Refined):** This observation refines this heuristic by demonstrating a response to an information-gathering failure. My previous broad searches for amicus briefs were not fruitful in finding the opposition's arguments. The refined strategy is to recognize when a broad approach yields diminishing returns and pivot.\n\n5.  **NEW HEURISTIC \u2014 Pivot from Broad to Targeted Search:** When a significant and expected piece of evidence (like an opposing expert brief in a major constitutional case) is missing after broad searches, the optimal strategy is to pivot to targeted searches. This involves identifying specific, high-probability sources (e.g., organizations like the EFF or ACLU known for their consistent advocacy and expertise on an issue) and searching directly for their contributions to the case. This is more efficient than continuing with broad, generic queries.\n\n6.  **Isolate Commercially Interested Amici (Stable):** The strategy of extracting verifiable facts while discounting the legal and qualitative conclusions of commercially interested parties like Yoti remains sound. The next step is to find data to test those extracted facts.\n\n7.  **The \"Technology Changed\" Argument (Stable):** The insight that a successful \"technology changed\" argument requires a complete, data-rich \"off-ramp\" for the Court is stable. My current task is to see if the petitioners can successfully argue that this off-ramp leads off a cliff.\n\n8.  **The Power of Framing and Analogy (Stable):** The \"bartender\" analogy's power is noted. The next step is to discover the counter-analogy or counter-frame the petitioners will deploy. Will they frame it as a \"digital panopticon,\" a \"chilling speech tax,\" or something else?\n\n9.  **NEW HEURISTIC \u2014 The Value of Meta-Cognitive Actions (`THINK`):** The DBOED process is not just about gathering external data. It is also about internal reasoning. Periodically executing a `THINK` action to pause, summarize the current state of belief, explicitly identify the most critical uncertainties, and formulate a precise plan to address them is a high-value strategy. It prevents wasted effort on low-value information gathering and ensures that the next action is maximally informative."

ACLU (Ashcroft II), 542 U.S. 656 (2004), \nthe \nCourt \nconsidered \na \ncontent-based \nspeech \nrestriction on sexually explicit materials on the \nInternet that Congress deemed harmful to minors. In \nconsidering this question, the Court assumed that \ncertain protected speech may be regulated, with the \nkey consideration being determining the least \nrestrictive alternative that can be used to achieve that \ngoal. In Ashcroft II, blocking and filtering software \nwas found to be the least restrictive alternative. In \nthis case, age verification technology is proposed as \nthe least restrictive alternative to achieving Texas\u2019s \nuncontested goal of protecting minors from obscene \ncontent on the Internet. \nThe Court in Ashcroft II conducted an in-depth \nanalysis of the viability and effectiveness of filtering \nsoftware circa February 1999\u2014over 25 years ago. The \nCourt found that this technological solution was the \nleast restrictive means of regulating Internet \nobscenity, with the crucial caveat that \u201cit is \nreasonable to assume that other technological \ndevelopments important to the First Amendment \nanalysis have also occurred during that time.\u201d Id. at \n671. \nThis \namicus \nbrief \nis \nabout \n\u201ctechnological \ndevelopments important to the First Amendment \nanalysis,\u201d acknowledging the Court\u2019s finding that \u201cthe \ntechnology of the Internet evolves at a rapid pace.\u201d Id. \nIn this case, the District Court soundly rejected age \nverification technology in favor of content filtering \nsoftware, while the Fifth Circuit held that Texas\u2019s \n\n \n4 \n\u201cage \nverification \nrequirement \nlikely \npasses \nconstitutional \nmuster \nunder \nthe \nrational-basis \nstandard in Ginsberg.\u201d Pet.App.27a. \nUnderstanding \nage \nverification \ntechnologies \nis \nessential to deciding whether their application is the \nleast \nrestrictive \nalternative \nunder \nthe \nFirst \nAmendment. \nARGUMENT \nI. \nAge Verification Technology is the Least \nRestrictive Alternative and is Narrowly \nTailored to Achieve Texas\u2019s Well-Founded \nGoal of Protecting Minors from Obscene \nContent on the Internet \nThis brief outlines practical examples of how current \nage verification technology (also known as age \nassurance technology) is working today, focusing on \nartificial intelligence (AI) driven facial age estimation. \nAI facial age estimation is the most popular age \nverification technology with individuals and the most \nprevalent approach by volume. It does not require \nusing an identity document or other identity data, nor \ndoes it require using facial recognition technology. No \ndatabase is created; no images are stored. The \nalgorithm does not learn anything from each \nadditional age check undertaken. \nYoti Ltd., a worldwide leader in age verification, offers \na wide range of approaches, and has undertaken over \n700 million age checks. Yoti is therefore uniquely \nqualified to explain the ease of use, accuracy, \naffordability, security, effectiveness, and accessibility, \nincluding details on how AI-driven facial age \n\n \n5 \nestimation \nmeets \nrigorous \ndata \nprotection \nrequirements to preserve privacy. This brief details \nexamples of how and where this low-friction \ntechnology is already operating globally at scale with \nleading web platforms. \nEvery month, AI-driven facial age estimation \ntechnology already enables tens of millions of adults \nto verify their age in about one second. The facial \nimage is not stored and there is no reliance on any \nidentity documentation. This technology enables \nplatforms to easily distinguish an adult from a minor \nat a global scale and in the volumes required for global \nplatforms such as Meta. \nWith the user\u2019s consent, Yoti can store the results of a \npreviously completed facial age estimation on the \nuser\u2019s device as a reusable digital ID or wallet. This \ndigital ID or wallet can then be utilized to access any \nwebsite containing adult content. \nTaking this technology one step further, reusable \napproaches, termed \u2018tokens,\u2019 are now available so \nrepeat visitors to an age-gated website, such as adult \ncontent websites, can prove their age once and then \ncontinue to use the generated age verification token \nindefinitely. The French government is the first \ngovernment to issue guidelines authorizing the use of \ntokens as an appropriate method of age verification, \nbeginning when age verification for adult content \ncomes into force in France in January 2025.12 \n \n12 https://www.arcom.fr/nos-ressources/espace-juridique/textes-\njuridiques/referentiel-technique-sur-la-verification-de-lage-\npour-la-protection-des-mineurs-contre-la-pornographie-en-ligne \n\n \n6 \nThere is a range of fallback options and exciting new \npossibilities for how visitors to age-gated websites can \nprove their age and only share their adult status, \nwhile ensuring privacy and security across platforms \nand websites. \nA. \nAge Verification Technology Does \nNot Impose Categorically Different \nBurdens on Adults and is Akin to \nIn-Person Age Verification \nAt a bar, bartenders routinely inspect an individual \nand, based on an initial estimation of their age, decide \nwhether to request a physical identification document \nsuch as a driver's license. To complete manual age \nverification, a government-issued identity document \nneeds to be reviewed to determine whether it is a bona \nfide document, whether the image of the person in the \ndocument matches the person presenting it, and check \nthe date of birth to ascertain if the person is old \nenough to consume alcohol. \nIn today\u2019s online world, platforms are already \nharnessing a range of technologies to assess age, \nfrequently working with independent age verification \nproviders. Platforms can select a range of age \nverification options to offer customers a choice and can \nmake their own determination about what range of \noptions suits their customers, accounting for different \nmarkets, regulatory requirements, and demographics. \nOne technological method emulates the human ability \nto estimate age, as demonstrated by the bartender \nexample of someone with years of experience \ndiscerning adults from minors \u2013 this is facial age \nestimate. \n\n \n7 \nSome age verification methods build on the physical \nreview of the document model by technologically \nchecking the document\u2019s authenticity and then \nchecking that the person presenting it is, in fact, the \nrightful owner. \nThis technology typically utilizes ID document \ndatabases to determine if the format of the document \nbeing presented is authentic, liveness detection to \nensure that the person presenting the document is \nalive, and face matching to compare the person \npresenting the document to the face on the document. \nIn addition, depending on the circumstances, it may \nbe necessary to verify individuals using data points \nfrom authoritative sources such as department of \nmotor vehicle databases, voter registration records, or \ncredit reference databases. \nIt is common for visitors of adult content websites to \nvisit numerous sites over several hours. Since it is \ninconvenient and excessive for such users to undergo \nage verification every time they access adult websites, \nthe age verification technology industry has developed \nreusable tokens that allow users to repeatedly visit \nadult content sites without undergoing repeated age \nverification checks. \nThe typical adult content site consists of an initial \n\u2018landing page\u2019 that can offer several types of age \nverification options, enabling the consumer to pick the \none they prefer. Some methods may involve just one \nor two clicks and take just one or two seconds, \nequivalent to or less than the time it takes a bartender \nto do a visual estimation and ask an individual to dig \nout their ID from their wallet, hand it over, and \npresent it for inspection. \n\n \n8 \nCurrent age verification methods include: \n1. \nEstimating age from a user\u2019s \nfacial image using AI facial \nage estimation technology \nIn everyday life, we are all human age estimators; we \nsubconsciously assess the ages of those we encounter, \ndrawing on our lived experience. Consider a long-\ntenured high school principal. His experience dealing \nwith teenagers would make him more accurate than \nthe average adult at differentiating those under 18 \nfrom those over 18. \nThe most developed age estimation approach, which \nhas been around for over a decade, utilizes a facial \nimage. This image-based technology was initially \nreviewed by NIST over a decade ago and is now part \nof an ongoing NIST benchmarking assessment13 and \nis currently under review by nationally accredited \naudit bodies such as the Age Check Certification \nScheme (ACCS)14 with well-established companies \nsuch as Google, Fujitsu, Idemia providing this service. \nBased on NIST data, these models are likely to be \naccurate within one to three years of the individual\u2019s \nage, depending on the age range. Specifically, the \naccuracy for younger individuals is approximately 1 to \n1.5 years, whereas the accuracy for older individuals \nis around 2-4 years. There is higher accuracy for \nyounger versus older people given that physical \nappearance is impacted over time in relation to the \n \n13 https://pages.nist.gov/frvt/html/frvt_age_estimation.html \n14 See https://accscheme.com/ and \nhttps://accscheme.com/registry/ \n\n \n9 \nindividual\u2019s lived experience. The error rate increases \nwith age, as well. \nWhen a visitor arrives on an adult website landing \npage, the request to prove age may appear in a new \nwindow or a pop-up frame. Most adult content users \naccess websites using mobile devices and are asked to \ntake a photo using their phone\u2019s camera. Desktop \nusers can do the same via their laptop webcam. \nFacial \nage \nestimation \ntechnology \ndetermines \nsomeone\u2019s age using a facial image. The user simply \nlooks at the camera on their device, positions their \nface in the oval shape provided, and takes their photo. \nThe image is then analyzed by an algorithm trained \nto determine age by analyzing facial features from a \ndiverse training set of images where the actual age \nwas known in months and years. \nTo the software model, the new image presented is \nsimply a pattern of pixels, and the pixels are numbers. \nFacial age estimation technology has been trained to \nspot patterns in numbers and pinpoint how people of \na particular age appear in those number patterns. The \nfacial age estimation process usually takes less than \none second. It can produce either a yes/no result on \nwhether the individual in the image meets a \ndesignated age threshold or an estimated age. The \nimage is assessed directly and there is no need to store \nit, so nothing is stored, ensuring the visitor\u2019s privacy. \nIf the visitor meets the age required (e.g., 18+), the age \nestimation technology confirms to the adult website \nthat the user can proceed, and the user can then \naccess the adult content on the website. \n\n \n10 \nA website operator can require an \u2018age buffer\u2019 in years \nabove the age of access. For example, the website \noperator could decide that if the age of access is 18 \nyears and a method is accurate to within 1 to 1.5 \nyears, then this method can be used by all visitors who \nare, for instance, two, three, or five years older than \nthe necessary age, translating to 20, 21 or 23 years \nold. Visitors within this buffer\u2014below 20 in this \nexample\u2014will need to use an additional age \nverification check to help pinpoint their age. \nIn Yoti\u2019s publicly accessible white papers, we \nregularly publish the mean absolute errors, false \npositives, and false negatives for each age group \nacross gender and skin tone. In our most recent white \npaper, published in September 2024, the Yoti \nalgorithm produces a true positive rate for thirteen- to \nseventeen-year-old minors as correctly estimated as \nunder age twenty-one 99.2% of the time. The false \npositives rate reveals that under 1% of fourteen to \nseventeen-year-olds incorrectly judged to be over age \ntwenty-one as 0.03% for fourteen-year-olds, 0.34% for \nfifteen-year-olds, 0.73% for sixteen-year-olds and \n2.43% of seventeen-year-olds.15 \nUsing modern age verification technology, all adults \nabove age twenty or twenty-one can easily and \nsecurely assert their adult status in a privacy-ensured \nway in around one second. This method is highly \naccurate against different ages and skin tones, where \nthe technology is consistently trained at scale and \n \n15 https://www.yoti.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Yoti-Age-\nEstimation-White-Paper-September-2024-PUBLIC.pdf page 31. \n\n \n11 \nusing artificial intelligence is constantly improving \nover time. \nTo achieve a high level of assurance, facial age \nestimation should always be used in combination with \nliveness detection\u2013 including both presentation and \ninjection attack detection\u2013 and be subject to \ncontinuous independent testing and monitoring. \nLiveness checks prevent people from using a photo, \nvideo, or mask instead of taking a live photo. Facial \ninjection attack detection ensures that the image \nbeing analyzed originates from a live source, such as \nthe device camera, and not from a fraudulent or pre-\nrecorded \ninput. \nThis \ntechnique \nverifies \nthe \nauthenticity of the face by distinguishing between \nreal-time facial data and injected, manipulated, or \nreplayed images, helping to prevent spoofing or \nunauthorized access. \nWith the rise of generative AI technology and \ndeepfakes to circumvent age verification checks, the \nability to prevent direct and indirect injection attacks \nis also required.16 Website operators must identify \nand prevent sophisticated injection attacks, ensuring \nthat the images captured during a verification process \nare genuine and remain untampered with.17 \nThe ongoing large scale NIST evaluation uses over 11 \nmillion data points and provides scientific certainty \nfor businesses and governments that facial age \nestimation is an accurate, fair, and privacy-preserving \n \n16 https://www.yoti.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Yoti-How-\nto-combat-Generative-AI-and-deepfakes-white-paper.pdf \n17 https://www.yoti.com/blog/yoti-releases-white-paper-\ndetailing-approach-to-combating-generative-ai-and-deepfakes/ \n\n \n12 \nage assurance solution.18 Audit bodies such as ACCS \nhave been auditing facial age estimation since 2020. \nThey also provide testing, using high-quality test \nimages captured from mobile phones, to provide \ntesting conditions closer to those of adult content and \nsocial media companies. \nFacial age estimation has been approved by a range of \nregulators as a method for age verification to access \nadult content: the German regulators (KJM and FSM) \nhave been using it since 2021 with a 5-year buffer. The \nFrench content and data protection regulators (Arcom \nand CNIL) and the UK data protection and content \nregulators (ICO and OFCOM) clearly state it as an \nappropriate method. \n2. \nDocument-based verification \nusing a physical identity \ndocument \nFor individuals within a defined buffer zone\u2014for \nexample between the ages of eighteen and twenty-\none\u2014other forms of verification, such as document-\nbased verification, can be utilized as a fallback or \nsupplemental method of establishing age. \nDocument-based verification requires assurances that \nthe actual owner of the document is the person \nproviding the document. So, in the same way a \nthorough bartender will carefully compare the \ndocument to the person presenting it, effective online \ndocument-based age verification requires document \nauthenticity checks, face matching, and liveness \nverification. Using these three steps, website \n \n18 https://pages.nist.gov/frvt/reports/aev/fate_aev_report.pdf \n\n \n13 \noperators have a high level of assurance that the \ndocument is authentic, belongs to the right person, \nand that the document owner is the person presenting \nthe document at that discrete moment in time. \nDocument-based age verification technology and \nhuman analysts in Yoti\u2019s 24-hour data security \ncenters review documents to detect a range of fraud \nvectors, including fake, tampered-with, borrowed, or \ncounterfeit documents. \nSharing an identity document might be perceived as \ndisclosing more individually identifying details, such \nas name, nationality, and address, alongside a live \nfacial scan; however, in actuality, just the anonymized \nage attribute or \u201cage over\u201d such as \u201c18\u201d is shared with \nthe adult content site. \nThe Yoti terms of service and industry best practices, \nalong with legal and regulatory requirements in the \nUK and EU, require that only the age result is \ntransferred and that any personal data captured as \npart of a one-time upload of an identity document \nverification check is promptly deleted after the age \nverification check is completed. \n3. \nChecking against databases, \ncredit reference agencies, \nmobile phone operators, and \nother semi-public data \nsources \nThere are a number of techniques that have long been \nused for Know Your Customer checks in financial \nservices and gambling, and as in the example above, \nthey can also be utilized to determine whether a user \nis an adult or a minor. \n\n \n14 \n4. \nReusable digital identity apps \nRepeatedly undergoing age verification checks is not \nonly tiresome, but it can limit users\u2019 engagement and \naccess to legally accessible content. Especially for \nusers close in age to legal adulthood, a more \npermanent method of assuring age is possible by \nusing a digital identity app that allows them to \nestablish their age once and then utilize this proof of \nage in many different contexts, on many different \nwebsites and platforms. \nIn addition to storing document-based verification, a \ndigital ID app can utilize facial age estimation to \nvalidate age once and then share that verification \nwhen required across the Internet. In the physical \nworld, a location might allow visitors seeking access \nto an adult venue to scan a QR code and share a \nverified age estimation via a reusable digital identity \napp. \nIn the online world, a digital identity app simply \ncertifies that the visitor is an adult through a simple \n\u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d check. Nothing further is shared with the \nwebsite operator, and no personal information is \nrevealed, ensuring complete privacy for the user. \n5. \nAge assurance tokens in \nwhich validation on one \nwebsite is transferrable to \nanother website \nAll the above age assurance options can be \nindependently assessed, accredited, and tokenized. \nWebsites can determine which methods they accept, \nwhether to tokenize, and the duration of the tokens. \n\n \n15 \nUsing tokens decreases the costs for relying parties \nand can further reduce any burden by the visitor to \nkeep verifying their age at each adult site they visit. \nAge assurance tokens allow a visitor to determine \ntheir age once using any of the methods above and \nthen use that same verification repeatedly across \nwebsites. An anonymous cookie is added to their \nbrowser which is then accessed by subsequent \nwebsites. Tokens don\u2019t contain any identifiable \ninformation, just the age verification result and \ninformation about how the check was performed. \nTokens can be stored in a confidential age verification \naccount, cached, and utilized over and over again \nindefinitely. \nUsers can pass their age tokens to another browser or, \nafter clearing their cache, by logging on to their age \nverification account. Once cached or re-cached, users \ncan freely visit other sites that accept the token \ncriteria. If a user visits a site with different criteria, \nsuch as a higher age threshold or one requiring a more \nrecently issued token, the user will be asked to \nundertake a new age verification. \nThe information shared with the relying party is the \nsum of the token\u2019s information, as detailed above. This \ncomprises the method of age assurance used, the type \nof age recorded\u2014such as age over, age under, or age \nrange\u2014the issuer of the age token, the type of liveness \ncheck performed, the type of authenticity check \nperformed, and the time and date the check was \nperformed. \n\n \n16 \nB. \nAge Verification Technology Does \nNot Unreasonably Implicate or \nIntrude Upon the Privacy of Adults \nUsing modern age verification technology, as soon as \na visitor\u2019s age is estimated, their facial image is \ndeleted, ensuring their privacy at all times. Visitors \ndo not need to provide personal details like their name \nor date of birth or share any identity documents. The \ntechnology is specifically designed not to identify \nanyone. Unlike facial-recognition technology, age \nverification technology estimates someone\u2019s age \nwithout identity matching that person or acq\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

ACLU (Ashcroft II), 542 U.S. 656 (2004), \nthe \nCourt \nconsidered \na \ncontent-based \nspeech \nrestriction on sexually explicit materials on the \nInternet that Congress deemed harmful to minors. In \nconsidering this question, the Court assumed that \ncertain protected speech may be regulated, with the \nkey consideration being determining the least \nrestrictive alternative that can be used to achieve that \ngoal. In Ashcroft II, blocking and filtering software \nwas found to be the least restrictive alternative. In \nthis case, age verification technology is proposed as \nthe least restrictive alternative to achieving Texas\u2019s \nuncontested goal of protecting minors from obscene \ncontent on the Internet. \nThe Court in Ashcroft II conducted an in-depth \nanalysis of the viability and effectiveness of filtering \nsoftware circa February 1999\u2014over 25 years ago. The \nCourt found that this technological solution was the \nleast restrictive means of regulating Internet \nobscenity, with the crucial caveat that \u201cit is \nreasonable to assume that other technological \ndevelopments important to the First Amendment \nanalysis have also occurred during that time.\u201d Id. at \n671. \nThis \namicus \nbrief \nis \nabout \n\u201ctechnological \ndevelopments important to the First Amendment \nanalysis,\u201d acknowledging the Court\u2019s finding that \u201cthe \ntechnology of the Internet evolves at a rapid pace.\u201d Id. \nIn this case, the District Court soundly rejected age \nverification technology in favor of content filtering \nsoftware, while the Fifth Circuit held that Texas\u2019s \n\n \n4 \n\u201cage \nverification \nrequirement \nlikely \npasses \nconstitutional \nmuster \nunder \nthe \nrational-basis \nstandard in Ginsberg.\u201d Pet.App.27a. \nUnderstanding \nage \nverification \ntechnologies \nis \nessential to deciding whether their application is the \nleast \nrestrictive \nalternative \nunder \nthe \nFirst \nAmendment. \nARGUMENT \nI. \nAge Verification Technology is the Least \nRestrictive Alternative and is Narrowly \nTailored to Achieve Texas\u2019s Well-Founded \nGoal of Protecting Minors from Obscene \nContent on the Internet \nThis brief outlines practical examples of how current \nage verification technology (also known as age \nassurance technology) is working today, focusing on \nartificial intelligence (AI) driven facial age estimation. \nAI facial age estimation is the most popular age \nverification technology with individuals and the most \nprevalent approach by volume. It does not require \nusing an identity document or other identity data, nor \ndoes it require using facial recognition technology. No \ndatabase is created; no images are stored. The \nalgorithm does not learn anything from each \nadditional age check undertaken. \nYoti Ltd., a worldwide leader in age verification, offers \na wide range of approaches, and has undertaken over \n700 million age checks. Yoti is therefore uniquely \nqualified to explain the ease of use, accuracy, \naffordability, security, effectiveness, and accessibility, \nincluding details on how AI-driven facial age \n\n \n5 \nestimation \nmeets \nrigorous \ndata \nprotection \nrequirements to preserve privacy. This brief details \nexamples of how and where this low-friction \ntechnology is already operating globally at scale with \nleading web platforms. \nEvery month, AI-driven facial age estimation \ntechnology already enables tens of millions of adults \nto verify their age in about one second. The facial \nimage is not stored and there is no reliance on any \nidentity documentation. This technology enables \nplatforms to easily distinguish an adult from a minor \nat a global scale and in the volumes required for global \nplatforms such as Meta. \nWith the user\u2019s consent, Yoti can store the results of a \npreviously completed facial age estimation on the \nuser\u2019s device as a reusable digital ID or wallet. This \ndigital ID or wallet can then be utilized to access any \nwebsite containing adult content. \nTaking this technology one step further, reusable \napproaches, termed \u2018tokens,\u2019 are now available so \nrepeat visitors to an age-gated website, such as adult \ncontent websites, can prove their age once and then \ncontinue to use the generated age verification token \nindefinitely. The French government is the first \ngovernment to issue guidelines authorizing the use of \ntokens as an appropriate method of age verification, \nbeginning when age verification for adult content \ncomes into force in France in January 2025.12 \n \n12 https://www.arcom.fr/nos-ressources/espace-juridique/textes-\njuridiques/referentiel-technique-sur-la-verification-de-lage-\npour-la-protection-des-mineurs-contre-la-pornographie-en-ligne \n\n \n6 \nThere is a range of fallback options and exciting new \npossibilities for how visitors to age-gated websites can \nprove their age and only share their adult status, \nwhile ensuring privacy and security across platforms \nand websites. \nA. \nAge Verification Technology Does \nNot Impose Categorically Different \nBurdens on Adults and is Akin to \nIn-Person Age Verification \nAt a bar, bartenders routinely inspect an individual \nand, based on an initial estimation of their age, decide \nwhether to request a physical identification document \nsuch as a driver's license. To complete manual age \nverification, a government-issued identity document \nneeds to be reviewed to determine whether it is a bona \nfide document, whether the image of the person in the \ndocument matches the person presenting it, and check \nthe date of birth to ascertain if the person is old \nenough to consume alcohol. \nIn today\u2019s online world, platforms are already \nharnessing a range of technologies to assess age, \nfrequently working with independent age verification \nproviders. Platforms can select a range of age \nverification options to offer customers a choice and can \nmake their own determination about what range of \noptions suits their customers, accounting for different \nmarkets, regulatory requirements, and demographics. \nOne technological method emulates the human ability \nto estimate age, as demonstrated by the bartender \nexample of someone with years of experience \ndiscerning adults from minors \u2013 this is facial age \nestimate. \n\n \n7 \nSome age verification methods build on the physical \nreview of the document model by technologically \nchecking the document\u2019s authenticity and then \nchecking that the person presenting it is, in fact, the \nrightful owner. \nThis technology typically utilizes ID document \ndatabases to determine if the format of the document \nbeing presented is authentic, liveness detection to \nensure that the person presenting the document is \nalive, and face matching to compare the person \npresenting the document to the face on the document. \nIn addition, depending on the circumstances, it may \nbe necessary to verify individuals using data points \nfrom authoritative sources such as department of \nmotor vehicle databases, voter registration records, or \ncredit reference databases. \nIt is common for visitors of adult content websites to \nvisit numerous sites over several hours. Since it is \ninconvenient and excessive for such users to undergo \nage verification every time they access adult websites, \nthe age verification technology industry has developed \nreusable tokens that allow users to repeatedly visit \nadult content sites without undergoing repeated age \nverification checks. \nThe typical adult content site consists of an initial \n\u2018landing page\u2019 that can offer several types of age \nverification options, enabling the consumer to pick the \none they prefer. Some methods may involve just one \nor two clicks and take just one or two seconds, \nequivalent to or less than the time it takes a bartender \nto do a visual estimation and ask an individual to dig \nout their ID from their wallet, hand it over, and \npresent it for inspection. \n\n \n8 \nCurrent age verification methods include: \n1. \nEstimating age from a user\u2019s \nfacial image using AI facial \nage estimation technology \nIn everyday life, we are all human age estimators; we \nsubconsciously assess the ages of those we encounter, \ndrawing on our lived experience. Consider a long-\ntenured high school principal. His experience dealing \nwith teenagers would make him more accurate than \nthe average adult at differentiating those under 18 \nfrom those over 18. \nThe most developed age estimation approach, which \nhas been around for over a decade, utilizes a facial \nimage. This image-based technology was initially \nreviewed by NIST over a decade ago and is now part \nof an ongoing NIST benchmarking assessment13 and \nis currently under review by nationally accredited \naudit bodies such as the Age Check Certification \nScheme (ACCS)14 with well-established companies \nsuch as Google, Fujitsu, Idemia providing this service. \nBased on NIST data, these models are likely to be \naccurate within one to three years of the individual\u2019s \nage, depending on the age range. Specifically, the \naccuracy for younger individuals is approximately 1 to \n1.5 years, whereas the accuracy for older individuals \nis around 2-4 years. There is higher accuracy for \nyounger versus older people given that physical \nappearance is impacted over time in relation to the \n \n13 https://pages.nist.gov/frvt/html/frvt_age_estimation.html \n14 See https://accscheme.com/ and \nhttps://accscheme.com/registry/ \n\n \n9 \nindividual\u2019s lived experience. The error rate increases \nwith age, as well. \nWhen a visitor arrives on an adult website landing \npage, the request to prove age may appear in a new \nwindow or a pop-up frame. Most adult content users \naccess websites using mobile devices and are asked to \ntake a photo using their phone\u2019s camera. Desktop \nusers can do the same via their laptop webcam. \nFacial \nage \nestimation \ntechnology \ndetermines \nsomeone\u2019s age using a facial image. The user simply \nlooks at the camera on their device, positions their \nface in the oval shape provided, and takes their photo. \nThe image is then analyzed by an algorithm trained \nto determine age by analyzing facial features from a \ndiverse training set of images where the actual age \nwas known in months and years. \nTo the software model, the new image presented is \nsimply a pattern of pixels, and the pixels are numbers. \nFacial age estimation technology has been trained to \nspot patterns in numbers and pinpoint how people of \na particular age appear in those number patterns. The \nfacial age estimation process usually takes less than \none second. It can produce either a yes/no result on \nwhether the individual in the image meets a \ndesignated age threshold or an estimated age. The \nimage is assessed directly and there is no need to store \nit, so nothing is stored, ensuring the visitor\u2019s privacy. \nIf the visitor meets the age required (e.g., 18+), the age \nestimation technology confirms to the adult website \nthat the user can proceed, and the user can then \naccess the adult content on the website. \n\n \n10 \nA website operator can require an \u2018age buffer\u2019 in years \nabove the age of access. For example, the website \noperator could decide that if the age of access is 18 \nyears and a method is accurate to within 1 to 1.5 \nyears, then this method can be used by all visitors who \nare, for instance, two, three, or five years older than \nthe necessary age, translating to 20, 21 or 23 years \nold. Visitors within this buffer\u2014below 20 in this \nexample\u2014will need to use an additional age \nverification check to help pinpoint their age. \nIn Yoti\u2019s publicly accessible white papers, we \nregularly publish the mean absolute errors, false \npositives, and false negatives for each age group \nacross gender and skin tone. In our most recent white \npaper, published in September 2024, the Yoti \nalgorithm produces a true positive rate for thirteen- to \nseventeen-year-old minors as correctly estimated as \nunder age twenty-one 99.2% of the time. The false \npositives rate reveals that under 1% of fourteen to \nseventeen-year-olds incorrectly judged to be over age \ntwenty-one as 0.03% for fourteen-year-olds, 0.34% for \nfifteen-year-olds, 0.73% for sixteen-year-olds and \n2.43% of seventeen-year-olds.15 \nUsing modern age verification technology, all adults \nabove age twenty or twenty-one can easily and \nsecurely assert their adult status in a privacy-ensured \nway in around one second. This method is highly \naccurate against different ages and skin tones, where \nthe technology is consistently trained at scale and \n \n15 https://www.yoti.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Yoti-Age-\nEstimation-White-Paper-September-2024-PUBLIC.pdf page 31. \n\n \n11 \nusing artificial intelligence is constantly improving \nover time. \nTo achieve a high level of assurance, facial age \nestimation should always be used in combination with \nliveness detection\u2013 including both presentation and \ninjection attack detection\u2013 and be subject to \ncontinuous independent testing and monitoring. \nLiveness checks prevent people from using a photo, \nvideo, or mask instead of taking a live photo. Facial \ninjection attack detection ensures that the image \nbeing analyzed originates from a live source, such as \nthe device camera, and not from a fraudulent or pre-\nrecorded \ninput. \nThis \ntechnique \nverifies \nthe \nauthenticity of the face by distinguishing between \nreal-time facial data and injected, manipulated, or \nreplayed images, helping to prevent spoofing or \nunauthorized access. \nWith the rise of generative AI technology and \ndeepfakes to circumvent age verification checks, the \nability to prevent direct and indirect injection attacks \nis also required.16 Website operators must identify \nand prevent sophisticated injection attacks, ensuring \nthat the images captured during a verification process \nare genuine and remain untampered with.17 \nThe ongoing large scale NIST evaluation uses over 11 \nmillion data points and provides scientific certainty \nfor businesses and governments that facial age \nestimation is an accurate, fair, and privacy-preserving \n \n16 https://www.yoti.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Yoti-How-\nto-combat-Generative-AI-and-deepfakes-white-paper.pdf \n17 https://www.yoti.com/blog/yoti-releases-white-paper-\ndetailing-approach-to-combating-generative-ai-and-deepfakes/ \n\n \n12 \nage assurance solution.18 Audit bodies such as ACCS \nhave been auditing facial age estimation since 2020. \nThey also provide testing, using high-quality test \nimages captured from mobile phones, to provide \ntesting conditions closer to those of adult content and \nsocial media companies. \nFacial age estimation has been approved by a range of \nregulators as a method for age verification to access \nadult content: the German regulators (KJM and FSM) \nhave been using it since 2021 with a 5-year buffer. The \nFrench content and data protection regulators (Arcom \nand CNIL) and the UK data protection and content \nregulators (ICO and OFCOM) clearly state it as an \nappropriate method. \n2. \nDocument-based verification \nusing a physical identity \ndocument \nFor individuals within a defined buffer zone\u2014for \nexample between the ages of eighteen and twenty-\none\u2014other forms of verification, such as document-\nbased verification, can be utilized as a fallback or \nsupplemental method of establishing age. \nDocument-based verification requires assurances that \nthe actual owner of the document is the person \nproviding the document. So, in the same way a \nthorough bartender will carefully compare the \ndocument to the person presenting it, effective online \ndocument-based age verification requires document \nauthenticity checks, face matching, and liveness \nverification. Using these three steps, website \n \n18 https://pages.nist.gov/frvt/reports/aev/fate_aev_report.pdf \n\n \n13 \noperators have a high level of assurance that the \ndocument is authentic, belongs to the right person, \nand that the document owner is the person presenting \nthe document at that discrete moment in time. \nDocument-based age verification technology and \nhuman analysts in Yoti\u2019s 24-hour data security \ncenters review documents to detect a range of fraud \nvectors, including fake, tampered-with, borrowed, or \ncounterfeit documents. \nSharing an identity document might be perceived as \ndisclosing more individually identifying details, such \nas name, nationality, and address, alongside a live \nfacial scan; however, in actuality, just the anonymized \nage attribute or \u201cage over\u201d such as \u201c18\u201d is shared with \nthe adult content site. \nThe Yoti terms of service and industry best practices, \nalong with legal and regulatory requirements in the \nUK and EU, require that only the age result is \ntransferred and that any personal data captured as \npart of a one-time upload of an identity document \nverification check is promptly deleted after the age \nverification check is completed. \n3. \nChecking against databases, \ncredit reference agencies, \nmobile phone operators, and \nother semi-public data \nsources \nThere are a number of techniques that have long been \nused for Know Your Customer checks in financial \nservices and gambling, and as in the example above, \nthey can also be utilized to determine whether a user \nis an adult or a minor. \n\n \n14 \n4. \nReusable digital identity apps \nRepeatedly undergoing age verification checks is not \nonly tiresome, but it can limit users\u2019 engagement and \naccess to legally accessible content. Especially for \nusers close in age to legal adulthood, a more \npermanent method of assuring age is possible by \nusing a digital identity app that allows them to \nestablish their age once and then utilize this proof of \nage in many different contexts, on many different \nwebsites and platforms. \nIn addition to storing document-based verification, a \ndigital ID app can utilize facial age estimation to \nvalidate age once and then share that verification \nwhen required across the Internet. In the physical \nworld, a location might allow visitors seeking access \nto an adult venue to scan a QR code and share a \nverified age estimation via a reusable digital identity \napp. \nIn the online world, a digital identity app simply \ncertifies that the visitor is an adult through a simple \n\u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d check. Nothing further is shared with the \nwebsite operator, and no personal information is \nrevealed, ensuring complete privacy for the user. \n5. \nAge assurance tokens in \nwhich validation on one \nwebsite is transferrable to \nanother website \nAll the above age assurance options can be \nindependently assessed, accredited, and tokenized. \nWebsites can determine which methods they accept, \nwhether to tokenize, and the duration of the tokens. \n\n \n15 \nUsing tokens decreases the costs for relying parties \nand can further reduce any burden by the visitor to \nkeep verifying their age at each adult site they visit. \nAge assurance tokens allow a visitor to determine \ntheir age once using any of the methods above and \nthen use that same verification repeatedly across \nwebsites. An anonymous cookie is added to their \nbrowser which is then accessed by subsequent \nwebsites. Tokens don\u2019t contain any identifiable \ninformation, just the age verification result and \ninformation about how the check was performed. \nTokens can be stored in a confidential age verification \naccount, cached, and utilized over and over again \nindefinitely. \nUsers can pass their age tokens to another browser or, \nafter clearing their cache, by logging on to their age \nverification account. Once cached or re-cached, users \ncan freely visit other sites that accept the token \ncriteria. If a user visits a site with different criteria, \nsuch as a higher age threshold or one requiring a more \nrecently issued token, the user will be asked to \nundertake a new age verification. \nThe information shared with the relying party is the \nsum of the token\u2019s information, as detailed above. This \ncomprises the method of age assurance used, the type \nof age recorded\u2014such as age over, age under, or age \nrange\u2014the issuer of the age token, the type of liveness \ncheck performed, the type of authenticity check \nperformed, and the time and date the check was \nperformed. \n\n \n16 \nB. \nAge Verification Technology Does \nNot Unreasonably Implicate or \nIntrude Upon the Privacy of Adults \nUsing modern age verification technology, as soon as \na visitor\u2019s age is estimated, their facial image is \ndeleted, ensuring their privacy at all times. Visitors \ndo not need to provide personal details like their name \nor date of birth or share any identity documents. The \ntechnology is specifically designed not to identify \nanyone. Unlike facial-recognition technology, age \nverification technology estimates someone\u2019s age \nwithout identity matching that person or acquiring \nany details from them other than the facial image \nwhich is instantly assessed and then is no longer \nneeded, and therefore does not need to be stored.19 \nC. \nAge Verification Technology is \nCurrently being Successfully \nUtilized Worldwide \nMany of the largest and most successful social media, \nadult content websites, and gaming platforms already \nuse age verification technology, with millions of \nchecks being conducted monthly. \n \n \n \n \n19 https://ico.org.uk/media/for-\norganisations/documents/4020427/yoti-sandbox-\nexit_report_20220522.pdf \n\n \n17 \n \nExamples include: \nMeta, \nincluding \nFacebook \nDating, \nInstagram, and, more recently, Instagram \nTeen Accounts, utilizes age verification \ntechnology to support age-appropriate \naccess to these services. When Facebook \nDating and Instagram detect a user \nattempting to change their date of birth \nfrom under 18 to over 18, they deploy Yoti\u2019s \nfacial age estimation as one of the ways the \nperson can establish that they are an adult. \nThis tool has been deployed by Meta since \n2022. Meta recently introduced Instagram \nTeen \nAccounts \nwith \nbuilt-in \ndefault \nprotections limiting who can contact and \nthe content teen users can access. Teens \nunder sixteen need an adult\u2019s permission to \nuse less protective settings. For teen users \nwho want to switch to an adult account, \nInstagram uses Yoti facial age estimation, \namong other tools, to establish eligibility \nfor such an account. \n\n \n18 \nOnlyFans, \na \nsubscription-based \nsocial \nmedia platform for adults where both \ncreators and subscribers must be over \neighteen, \ndeploys \nage \nverification \ntechnology in many countries to ensure \nthat those engaging with the platform are \nadults. \nYubo, \na \nlive-streaming \nsocial \nmedia \nplatform with almost 60 million users, \noffers a service for adults and a separate \nservice for thirteen to seventeen-year-olds. \nSince 2022, Yubo has been using facial age \nestimation as its first point of contact to \nensure that users are old enough and \nprovided access to the proper content. Yubo \nemploys a fallback option for users close to \nage 18, such as using the Yoti reusable \ndigital ID app or a one-time document \nsubmission. \nD. \nTexas Can Impose a Content-Based \nSpeech Restriction on Sexually \nExplicit Materials on the Internet \nEven if it Results in a Cost to the \nWebsites and Platforms Hosting the \nContent \nCost is an understated but important issue in deciding \nthe least restrictive means of regulating Internet \nobscenity. The end user almost always bears the cost \nof blocking and filtering software, while the website \nprofiting from obscenity and adult content almost \nalways bears the cost of age verification technology. \nCost-shifting refers to allocating a policy or practice\u2019s \n\n \n19 \nexpenses or financial burdens to one party while \nallowing others to shirk or reduce these costs. \nUnder the First Amendment, the government cannot \nimpose a financial burden on speakers based on the \ncontent of their speech. Rosenberger v. Rector & \nVisitors of Univ. of Virginia, 515 U.S. 819, 828 (1995). \nHowever, imposing a cost is permissible if it is \n\u201cdesigned to meet the expenses incident to the \nadministration of the law.\u201d Forsyth Cnty., Ga. v. \nNationalist Movement, 505 U.S. 123, 129 n. 8 (1992). \nOne example is requiring fees and paid permits for \ngroups \nand \nindividuals \nexercising \ntheir \nFirst \nAmendment right to protest. Concerning permit fees, \nthe Supreme Court has ruled that costs must be \nreasonable and not prohibitively expensive, that they \ncannot be based on the content of the speech or the \nviewpoint of the demonstrators, and that they \ntypically cover administrative expenses such as \nprocessing the permit application, coordinating with \nlaw enforcement, and ensuring public safety during \nthe event. See e.g. iMatter Utah v. Njord, 774 F.3d \n1258 (10th Cir. 2014); Surita v. Hyde, 665 F.3d 860 \n(7th Cir. 2011). \nThe same principles can be applied when online adult \ncontent providers require age verification. In the case \nof age verification, cost-shifting legitimately places \nthe cost of age verification technology on the providers \nof adult content rather than on the consumers who \nwould otherwise incur costs by having to install and \nmaintain monitoring and filtering software on their \nown devices. Since the costs of operating and \nmaintaining modern age verification technology are \nno longer prohibitively expensive or unreasonable, \n\n \n20 \nrequiring adult websites to incur these costs does not \nviolate the websites\u2019 First Amendment rights.20  \nFurthermore, this cost evaluation does not consider \nthe actual negative societal costs when minors can \naccess explicit adult content, nor does it consider the \nundue burden that parents incur for the entire \nresponsibility of filtering, monitoring, and installing \nmonitoring and filtering software on their children\u2019s \nand shared family devices. \nWhen it comes to obscenity, the government has a \nmuch wider latitude to determine and impose costs, \nboth tangible and intangible. In Paris Adult Theatre I \nv. Slaton, 413 U.S. 49, 57\u201358 (1973), the Court held \nthat \u201cthere are legitimate state interests at stake in \nstemming the tide of commercialized obscenity, even \nassuming it is feasible to enforce effective safeguards \nagainst exposure to juveniles and to passersby. Rights \nand interests \u2018other than those of the advocates are \ninvolved.\u2019 These include the interest of the public in \nthe quality of life and the total community \nenvironment, the tone of commerce in the great city \ncenters, and, possibly, the public safety itself.\u201d \nInternal citations removed. \n \n \n \n20 See Declaration of Tony Allen: \u201cYoti state that their Age \nVerification Service (AVS) pricing ranges between $0.03 (for \nlarge volumes e.g. circa 100 M, $0.10 for circa 5M checks and \n$0.31 for lower volumes, one time account based checks e.g. \nunder 100,000). They also offer free, $0.0 shares of 18 plus \nattributes from the reusable Yoti digital identity app\u2026.\u201d \nJ.A.201. \n\n \n21 \nCONCLUSION \n\u201cUnderstandably those who entertain an absolutist \nview of the First Amendment find it uncomfortable to \nexplain why rights of association, speech, and press \nshould be severely restrained in the marketplace of \ngoods and money, but not in the marketplace of \npornography.\u201d Paris Adult Theatre I v. Slaton, 413 \nU.S. 49, 60\u201362 (1973). \nConsidering the arguments presented, it is evident \nthat \ncurrent \nage \nverification \ntechnologies, \nparticularly AI facial age estimation, offer practical, \nprivacy-preserving, and scalable solutions for online \nage verification. This technology provides a secure \nand efficient method for websites and platforms to \ncomply with legal requirements while respecting user \nprivacy. The methods outlined, including the reuse of \nage tokens and digital identity apps, further reduce \nuser friction while maintaining high accuracy and \nsecurity at a low cost. \nGiven the demonstrated effectiveness of these \ntechnologies in protecting minors and enabling adults \nto assert their age without unnecessary intrusion, the \nCourt should recognize that AI-driven facial age \nestimation \nsolutions \nare \nthe \nleast \nrestrictive \nalternative under the First Amendment when \nrestricting sexually explicit materials on the Internet. \nFor these reasons, Yoti Ltd. respectfully submits that \nthe Court should support the implementation of these \nadvanced age assurance technologies as a reliable \nmethod to comply with age verification requirements \nwhile also safeguarding privacy and promoting \naccessibility for all users. \n\n \n22 \nRESPECTFULLY SUBMITTED \nJAMES R.

          "task_beliefs": "My attempt to find the petitioners' expert rebuttal by searching for a brief from the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) was unsuccessful; the search returned the Yoti brief, which I have already analyzed. This null result provides no new substantive information about the case but reinforces the one-sided nature of my current evidence base.\n\n1.  **Central Legal Conflict (Stable):** The core of the case remains the choice between the *Ginsberg v. New York* rational basis standard and the *Ashcroft v. ACLU (Ashcroft II)* strict scrutiny standard for evaluating Texas H.B. 1181.\n\n2.  **Respondent's Path to Victory (Stable but Unchallenged):** The detailed technological argument presented in the Yoti amicus brief continues to be the strongest piece of evidence I possess. It outlines a clear path for the Court to uphold the law, even under strict scrutiny, by arguing that modern, privacy-preserving age verification is the least restrictive *effective* means. My knowledge of this argument is stable.\n\n3.  **Petitioners' Position (Critically Under-Informed):** My model of the petitioners' case remains hypothetical. The failure of my targeted search to locate their counter-argument makes its absence more conspicuous. My belief that their success hinges on a direct, expert-led refutation of the technology's efficacy, privacy, and feasibility is unchanged, but I have yet to find any evidence supporting this refutation.\n\n4.  **Prediction Model (Confidence Remains Provisional):** My provisional lean towards Texas is unchanged, but my awareness of its basis in incomplete data is heightened. This failed search attempt underscores that my prediction is a hypothesis built on a single, powerful, but uncontested dataset. The outcome still hinges entirely on the strength of the counter-evidence I have not yet found.\n\n5.  **Next Area of Uncertainty (Action Plan Reinforced):** The primary goal remains to resolve the single most important uncertainty: **What is the petitioners' expert rebuttal to the technological claims made by Yoti and other proponents of age verification?** The failure of my first targeted search does not change the goal; it simply indicates that the execution needs to be refined. The battle of dueling experts is still the central dynamic, and I must find the other expert.",
          "design_beliefs": "This observation, a failed information-gathering action, is highly valuable for refining my meta-level strategy. It provides crucial feedback on the implementation of my search heuristics and the nature of the tools at my disposal.\n\n1.  **Adopt a Dialectical Approach (Validated):** This heuristic remains central. The failure to find the \"antithesis\" (the petitioners' expert rebuttal) after a targeted search makes its discovery even more critical for reaching a sound \"synthesis\" (a robust prediction).\n\n2.  **Prioritize Foundational Documents (Stable):** Remains a core principle.\n\n3.  **Analyze Amicus Briefs (Refined):** The corollary to seek out *competing* expert briefs is now an active, and so far frustrated, part of my process. The value of this heuristic is underscored by the current imbalance in my knowledge.\n\n4.  **Strategic Sequencing of Information Gathering (Stable):** The logic of identifying a key uncertainty and then acting to resolve it remains sound.\n\n5.  **Pivot from Broad to Targeted Search (Refined):** My previous decision to pivot to a targeted search was sound in principle, but this observation reveals challenges in execution. The failure of a single targeted query (`'Electronic Frontier Foundation'`) does not invalidate the strategy. Instead, it teaches a crucial lesson about interacting with search tools.\n    *   **NEW SUB-HEURISTIC \u2014 Debug and Iterate on Targeted Searches:** When a targeted search fails or returns an irrelevant result (especially with a low relevance score like 0.320), the correct response is not to abandon the strategy but to debug the query. This involves:\n        *   **Trying alternate keywords:** Search for related organizations known for similar advocacy (e.g., ACLU, Center for Democracy & Technology).\n        *   **Varying the search term:** Use acronyms (EFF) vs. full names, or broader terms like \"amicus brief petitioners technology\".\n        *   **Adjusting search parameters:** Re-evaluate the combination of filters and keywords.\n    This iterative approach acknowledges that search tools can be imperfect and that finding specific information may require multiple, slightly different attempts.\n\n6.  **Isolate Commercially Interested Amici (Stable):** This principle remains effective. I have the facts from the commercially interested party (Yoti); my current goal is to find data from a non-commercial, mission-driven organization to test those facts.\n\n7.  **The \"Technology Changed\" Argument (Stable):** My understanding of this argument's structure is unchanged. I am still searching for the petitioners' argument that the \"off-ramp\" proposed by Texas and Yoti is technologically flawed or constitutionally impermissible.\n\n8.  **The Power of Framing and Analogy (Stable):** The \"bartender\" analogy remains potent and unanswered. The search for the petitioners' counter-frame continues.\n\n9.  **The Value of Meta-Cognitive Actions (`THINK`) (Validated):** The previous `THINK` step correctly identified the most critical uncertainty and formulated a plan. This observation is the result of executing that plan. The failure of the action does not invalidate the plan's premise but provides feedback for the next iteration of execution. This confirms the value of periodically pausing to assess and plan."

Literature 236 (1973) ......................... 18\n\n \n \nINTRODUCTION \nAmericans hold a wide range of views about sexual \ncontent online.  Some view it as offensive or indecent; \nfor others, it is artistic, informative, or even essential to \nimportant parts of career and life.  Consistent with the \nbedrock First Amendment principle that \u201cesthetic and \nmoral judgments about art and literature \u2026 are for the \nindividual to make, not for the Government to decree,\u201d \nthis Court has long treated non-obscene sexual content \nas constitutionally protected for adults.  United States \nv. Playboy Ent. Grp., Inc., 529 U.S. 803, 818 (2000).  And \nwhile the Court has held that states may limit minors\u2019 \naccess to sexual material reasonably found harmful to \nthem, Ginsberg v. New York, 390 U.S. 629, 638-39 (1968), \nthe Court has uniformly held that a content-based \nburden on adults\u2019 access to such protected speech \u201ccan \nstand only if it satisfies strict scrutiny,\u201d Playboy, 529 \nU.S. at 813; see Ashcroft v. ACLU, 542 U.S. 656, 665-66 \n(2004); Reno v. ACLU, 521 U.S. 844, 874 (1997); Sable \nCommc\u2019ns v. FCC, 492 U.S. 115, 126 (1989). \nEnacted in 2023, Texas House Bill (H.B.) 1181 \nimposes requirements on commercial websites \u201cmore \nthan one-third of which\u201d are \u201csexual material harmful \nto minors\u201d\u2014a term that includes all sexually suggestive \ncontent, as might be found in romance novels or R-rated \nmovies.  Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code \u00a7 129B.002(a).  The \nlaw requires a covered website to verify the age of every \nuser, typically via government-issued identification.  Id.  \n\u00a7\u00a7 129B.002-003.  Entities conducting such verification \nmay not \u201cretain\u201d users\u2019 \u201cidentifying information,\u201d id. \n\u00a7 129B.002(b), but H.B. 1181 does not prohibit transfer \nof that information or impose any other protection \nagainst disclosure.  And while Texas insists that forcing \nusers to endure chilling online privacy and security \n\n2 \n \n \nrisks is necessary to protect minors from harmful \nsexual content, H.B. 1181 exempts the search engines \nand social-media platforms that are principal gateways \nfor minors\u2019 access to that very content.  Id. \u00a7 129B.005. \nConfirming Texas\u2019s real aims, H.B. 1181 also requires \ncovered websites to post stigmatizing, unscientific \n\u201c[w]arnings\u201d that condemn their content as harmful to \nhealth.  Id. \u00a7 129B.004. \nThe district court preliminarily enjoined H.B. 1181, \nfinding that the law is subject to strict scrutiny and \nlikely to fail it under this Court\u2019s governing precedent.  \nIn particular, the court explained that H.B. 1181\u2019s age-\nverification requirement is materially identical to the \nChild Online Protection Act (COPA), 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 231, \nwhich this Court in Ashcroft held was subject to strict \nscrutiny and likely unconstitutional.  The Fifth Circuit \nagreed that H.B. 1181 is materially identical to COPA, \nbut a divided panel held that it was not bound by \nAshcroft because that decision contains what the \nmajority termed \u201cstartling omissions.\u201d  Pet. App. \n17a.  The majority concluded that the proper level of \nscrutiny is instead rational-basis review, as applied in \nGinsberg.  To justify its departure from Ashcroft, the \nmajority reasoned that this Court there applied strict \nscrutiny to COPA only because Attorney General \nAshcroft, represented by Solicitor General Olson, \nerroneously accepted strict scrutiny rather than urging \nmere rational-basis review in defense of the statute.   \nAs recognized by Judge Higginbotham\u2019s dissent, the \nFifth Circuit veered astray.  This Court in Ashcroft did \nnot apply strict scrutiny to COPA based on an oversight \nor concession.  It did so because First Amendment \nprinciples and precedent firmly establish that strict \nscrutiny \napplies \nto \ncontent-based \nburdens \non \n\n3 \n \n \nconstitutionally protected speech, specifically including \nsexual content that is not obscene for adults.  Neither \nTexas\u2019s professed aim to protect minors nor Ginsberg\u2019s \nholding\u2014which applies only to the rights of minors\u2014\nalters that analysis.  The laws in Ashcroft, Reno, \nPlayboy, and Sable all aimed to protect minors, and this \nCourt applied strict scrutiny in each of those post-\nGinsberg decisions.  Strict scrutiny applies here too. \nUnder strict scrutiny, this is a straightforward \ncase.  As the district court found and the Fifth Circuit \ndid not question, H.B. 1181 is both overinclusive and \nunderinclusive, and it fails to pursue its objective with \nthe means least restrictive of adults\u2019 protected speech.  \nIndeed, Texas has disregarded the measure specifically \nidentified in Ashcroft as both less restrictive and more \neffective than online age-verification: content-filtering \nsoftware, which limits minors\u2019 access to sexual material \ninappropriate for them without burdening adults\u2019 \naccess to speech they have a right to receive.  That \nlegislative oversight is especially striking because \ncontent-filtering \ntechnology \nhas \nimproved \nsince \nAshcroft.  Meanwhile, online age-verification has grown \neasier to circumvent and threats of online identity theft, \nextortion, and data breaches have multiplied\u2014\nheightening chills in the highly sensitive and personal \ncontext of accessing sexual material. \nRestoring the preliminary injunction of H.B. 1181 by \nreversing the erroneous decision below would not \nundermine genuine efforts to limit minors\u2019 access to \nsexually inappropriate material.  Petitioners agree that \nprotecting minors is a compelling government interest \nand that\u2014as this Court expressly stated in Ashcroft\u2014a \nlaw narrowly tailored to that objective can survive strict \nscrutiny.  542 U.S. at 672-73.  The Fifth Circuit\u2019s \n\n4 \n \n \napplication of rational-basis review is therefore as \nunnecessary as it is wrong.  As in other recent cases, the \nCourt should adhere to \u201csettled principles about \nfreedom of expression\u201d that have \u201cserved the Nation \nwell over many years\u201d and reject the Fifth Circuit\u2019s \njarring departure from First Amendment precedent.  \nMoody v. NetChoice, LLC, 144 S. Ct. 2383, 2403 (2024).   \nOPINIONS BELOW \nThe Fifth Circuit\u2019s opinion (Pet. App. 1a-87a) is \nreported at 95 F.4th 263.  The opinion of the district \ncourt granting a preliminary injunction (Pet. App. 90a-\n161a) is reported at 689 F. Supp. 3d 373. \nJURISDICTION \nThe Fifth Circuit entered its judgment on March 7, \n2024.  Petitioners timely petitioned for certiorari on \nApril 12, 2024.  This Court has jurisdiction under 28 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 1254(1). \nCONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY \nPROVISIONS INVOLVED \nThe First Amendment to the United States \nConstitution provides in relevant part that \u201cCongress \nshall make no law \u2026 abridging the freedom of speech.\u201d  \nH.B. 1181 is reproduced in an appendix to this brief. \nSTATEMENT \nA. Legal And Factual Background \n1.  \u201cThe most basic\u201d principle of free speech is that \n\u201cgovernment has no power to restrict expression \nbecause of its message, its ideas, its subject matter, or \nits content.\u201d  Brown v. Ent. Merchs. Ass\u2019n, 564 U.S. 786, \n790-91 (2011) (citation omitted).  Generally, when a law \n\u201cimposes a restriction on the content of protected \n\n5 \n \n \nspeech, it is invalid unless \u2026 it passes strict scrutiny\u2014\nthat is, unless it is justified by a compelling government \ninterest and is narrowly drawn to serve that interest.\u201d  \nId. at 799.  Otherwise, content-based speech restrictions \nare permitted only in limited \u201chistoric and traditional \ncategories long familiar to the bar.\u201d  United States v. \nStevens, 559 U.S. 460, 468 (2010) (citation omitted).   \nOne such category is obscenity, defined as material \nthat \n\u201cdepicts \nor \ndescribes \n\u2026 \nsexual \ncontent\u201d \n(specifically identified by statute), in a \u201cpatently \noffensive\u201d way that \u201cappeals to the prurient interest,\u201d \nand, taken as a whole, \u201clacks serious literary, artistic, \npolitical, or scientific value.\u201d  Miller v. California, 413 \nU.S. 15, 24 (1973) (citation omitted).  In Ginsberg, the \nCourt upheld a state law that \u201cadjusts the definition of \nobscenity\u201d applicable to minors based on their different \nreaction to sexual content.  Id. at 638 (citation omitted).  \nAs to adults, however, the Court has \u201cmade it perfectly \nclear that \u2018sexual expression which is \u2026 not obscene is \nprotected by the First Amendment.\u2019\u201d  Reno, 521 U.S. at \n874 (brackets and citation omitted).  And the Court has \nrepeatedly held that laws imposing content-based \nburdens on adults\u2019 access to such constitutionally \nprotected expression are subject to strict scrutiny, even \nif the laws permissibly aim to restrict minors\u2019 access to \nsuch material.  Id.; see Ashcroft, 542 U.S. at 665-66; \nPlayboy, 529 U.S. at 813; Sable, 492 U.S. at 126. \nThe Court\u2019s most recent decision in that line of cases \nis Ashcroft.  There, the Court considered a challenge to \nCOPA, \nwhich \nprohibited\u2014absent \nage-verification \nmeasures\u2014the online transmission of content that \nCongress deemed obscene for minors using a modified \nobscenity standard like the one at issue in Ginsberg.  \n542 U.S. at 661-62.  Because COPA burdened adults\u2019 \n\n6 \n \n \naccess to speech constitutionally protected for them, the \nCourt held that strict scrutiny applied for the same \nreasons as in analogous prior cases.  Id. at 665-66 (citing \nReno, 521 U.S. at 874); see id. at 670 (citing Playboy, \n529 U.S. at 825-26).  The Court then upheld a \npreliminary injunction of COPA, determining that the \nstatute was likely unconstitutional because \u201cless \nrestrictive \nalternatives\u201d\u2014in \nparticular, \ncontent-\nfiltering software\u2014\u201cwould be at least as effective in \nachieving the legitimate purpose that the statute was \nenacted to serve.\u201d  Id. at 665 (quoting Reno, 521 U.S. at \n874); see id. at 665-66, 673. \n2.  Almost 20 years after Ashcroft, in June 2023, \nTexas enacted H.B. 1181.  H.B. 1181 requires age \nverification by any commercial website \u201cmore than one-\nthird of which is sexual material harmful to minors,\u201d \nTex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code \u00a7 129B.002(a), defined \nusing almost exactly the same modification of the adult \nobscenity standard that Congress adopted in COPA, id. \n\u00a7 129B.001(6).1  Because this statutory definition \napplies to even the youngest minors, for whom almost \n \n1  \nSpecifically, H.B. 1181 defines \u201c[s]exual material harmful \nto minors\u201d as including material that \u201c(A) the average person \napplying contemporary community standards would find, taking \nthe material as a whole and with respect to minors, is designed to \nappeal to or pander to the prurient interest; (B) in a manner \npatently offensive with respect to minors, exploits, is devoted to, \nor principally consists of descriptions of actual, simulated, or \nanimated displays or depictions of: (i) a person\u2019s pubic hair, anus, \nor genitals or the nipple of the female breast; (ii) touching, \ncaressing, or fondling of nipples, breasts, buttocks, anuses, or \ngenitals; or (iii) sexual intercourse, masturbation, sodomy, \nbestiality, oral copulation, flagellation, excretory functions, \nexhibitions, or any other sexual act; and (C) taken as a whole, lacks \nserious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value for minors.\u201d \nTex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code \u00a7 129B.001(6). \n\n7 \n \n \nany sexual content could qualify as obscene, H.B. 1181 \ncovers \u201call salacious material,\u201d from sex-education \ncontent to simulated sex scenes in Oscar-winning films.  \nPet. App. 109a, 115a.  And because H.B. 1181 applies to \nany website that devotes any more than one-third of its \ncontent to such sexual material, its restrictions apply to \nbroad swaths of speech that are not sexual\u2014much less \nobscene, even as to minors.  \nH.B. 1181 also contains several conspicuous \nexemptions.  It expressly exempts search engines, Tex. \nCiv. Prac. & Rem. Code \u00a7 129B.005(b), even though they \ncan provide access to the same sexual content as \ncovered websites, see Pet. App. 112a.  And the law de \nfacto exempts social-media sites that contain less than \none-third sexual material, even if those sites contain a \nlarger total volume of sexual content (including the \nsame content) as covered websites.  Pet. App. 113a. \nTo comply with \nH.B. 1181\u2019s age-verification \nrequirement, covered websites must \u201cverify that an \nindividual attempting to access the [site] is\u201d at least 18 \nyears old using \u201cdigital identification,\u201d \u201cgovernment-\nissued identification,\u201d or \u201ca commercially reasonable \nmethod that relies on public or private transactional \ndata.\u201d  Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code \u00a7\u00a7 129B.002(a), \n129B.003.  An entity conducting age verification \u201cmay \nnot retain any identifying information of the individual,\u201d \nid. \u00a7 129B.002(b), but H.B. 1181 imposes no limits on \ntransmitting that information to others.  Nor does H.B. \n1181 establish any data-security requirements or \ndisclosure prohibitions for entities conducting age \nverification or others that receive identification \ninformation as part of the verification process. \nH.B. 1181 also mandates that covered websites post \nscripted \u201csexual materials health warnings\u201d on the \n\n8 \n \n \n\u201clanding page\u201d of the website and \u201call advertisements,\u201d \nalong with \u201chelpline\u201d numbers for \u201csubstance abuse and \nmental health.\u201d  Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code \n\u00a7 129B.004 (capitalization altered).  The purported \nwarnings state that \u201c[p]ornography is potentially \nbiologically addictive\u201d and \u201cproven to harm human \nbrain development.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 129B.004(1); see id. \n(\u201cExposure to this content is associated with low self-\nesteem and body image, eating disorders, impaired \nbrain development, and other emotional and mental \nillnesses.\u201d).  The statements are attributed to \u201cTEXAS \nHEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES,\u201d id., even \nthough that agency has not issued any such findings, \nPet. App. 95a.   \nNoncomplia\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

Some view it as offensive or indecent; \nfor others, it is artistic, informative, or even essential to \nimportant parts of career and life.  Consistent with the \nbedrock First Amendment principle that \u201cesthetic and \nmoral judgments about art and literature \u2026 are for the \nindividual to make, not for the Government to decree,\u201d \nthis Court has long treated non-obscene sexual content \nas constitutionally protected for adults.  United States \nv. Playboy Ent. Grp., Inc., 529 U.S. 803, 818 (2000).  And \nwhile the Court has held that states may limit minors\u2019 \naccess to sexual material reasonably found harmful to \nthem, Ginsberg v. New York, 390 U.S. 629, 638-39 (1968), \nthe Court has uniformly held that a content-based \nburden on adults\u2019 access to such protected speech \u201ccan \nstand only if it satisfies strict scrutiny,\u201d Playboy, 529 \nU.S. at 813; see Ashcroft v. ACLU, 542 U.S. 656, 665-66 \n(2004); Reno v. ACLU, 521 U.S. 844, 874 (1997); Sable \nCommc\u2019ns v. FCC, 492 U.S. 115, 126 (1989). \nEnacted in 2023, Texas House Bill (H.B.) 1181 \nimposes requirements on commercial websites \u201cmore \nthan one-third of which\u201d are \u201csexual material harmful \nto minors\u201d\u2014a term that includes all sexually suggestive \ncontent, as might be found in romance novels or R-rated \nmovies.  Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code \u00a7 129B.002(a).  The \nlaw requires a covered website to verify the age of every \nuser, typically via government-issued identification.  Id.  \n\u00a7\u00a7 129B.002-003.  Entities conducting such verification \nmay not \u201cretain\u201d users\u2019 \u201cidentifying information,\u201d id. \n\u00a7 129B.002(b), but H.B. 1181 does not prohibit transfer \nof that information or impose any other protection \nagainst disclosure.  And while Texas insists that forcing \nusers to endure chilling online privacy and security \n\n2 \n \n \nrisks is necessary to protect minors from harmful \nsexual content, H.B. 1181 exempts the search engines \nand social-media platforms that are principal gateways \nfor minors\u2019 access to that very content.  Id. \u00a7 129B.005. \nConfirming Texas\u2019s real aims, H.B. 1181 also requires \ncovered websites to post stigmatizing, unscientific \n\u201c[w]arnings\u201d that condemn their content as harmful to \nhealth.  Id. \u00a7 129B.004. \nThe district court preliminarily enjoined H.B. 1181, \nfinding that the law is subject to strict scrutiny and \nlikely to fail it under this Court\u2019s governing precedent.  \nIn particular, the court explained that H.B. 1181\u2019s age-\nverification requirement is materially identical to the \nChild Online Protection Act (COPA), 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 231, \nwhich this Court in Ashcroft held was subject to strict \nscrutiny and likely unconstitutional.  The Fifth Circuit \nagreed that H.B. 1181 is materially identical to COPA, \nbut a divided panel held that it was not bound by \nAshcroft because that decision contains what the \nmajority termed \u201cstartling omissions.\u201d  Pet. App. \n17a.  The majority concluded that the proper level of \nscrutiny is instead rational-basis review, as applied in \nGinsberg.  To justify its departure from Ashcroft, the \nmajority reasoned that this Court there applied strict \nscrutiny to COPA only because Attorney General \nAshcroft, represented by Solicitor General Olson, \nerroneously accepted strict scrutiny rather than urging \nmere rational-basis review in defense of the statute.   \nAs recognized by Judge Higginbotham\u2019s dissent, the \nFifth Circuit veered astray.  This Court in Ashcroft did \nnot apply strict scrutiny to COPA based on an oversight \nor concession.  It did so because First Amendment \nprinciples and precedent firmly establish that strict \nscrutiny \napplies \nto \ncontent-based \nburdens \non \n\n3 \n \n \nconstitutionally protected speech, specifically including \nsexual content that is not obscene for adults.  Neither \nTexas\u2019s professed aim to protect minors nor Ginsberg\u2019s \nholding\u2014which applies only to the rights of minors\u2014\nalters that analysis.  The laws in Ashcroft, Reno, \nPlayboy, and Sable all aimed to protect minors, and this \nCourt applied strict scrutiny in each of those post-\nGinsberg decisions.  Strict scrutiny applies here too. \nUnder strict scrutiny, this is a straightforward \ncase.  As the district court found and the Fifth Circuit \ndid not question, H.B. 1181 is both overinclusive and \nunderinclusive, and it fails to pursue its objective with \nthe means least restrictive of adults\u2019 protected speech.  \nIndeed, Texas has disregarded the measure specifically \nidentified in Ashcroft as both less restrictive and more \neffective than online age-verification: content-filtering \nsoftware, which limits minors\u2019 access to sexual material \ninappropriate for them without burdening adults\u2019 \naccess to speech they have a right to receive.  That \nlegislative oversight is especially striking because \ncontent-filtering \ntechnology \nhas \nimproved \nsince \nAshcroft.  Meanwhile, online age-verification has grown \neasier to circumvent and threats of online identity theft, \nextortion, and data breaches have multiplied\u2014\nheightening chills in the highly sensitive and personal \ncontext of accessing sexual material. \nRestoring the preliminary injunction of H.B. 1181 by \nreversing the erroneous decision below would not \nundermine genuine efforts to limit minors\u2019 access to \nsexually inappropriate material.  Petitioners agree that \nprotecting minors is a compelling government interest \nand that\u2014as this Court expressly stated in Ashcroft\u2014a \nlaw narrowly tailored to that objective can survive strict \nscrutiny.  542 U.S. at 672-73.  The Fifth Circuit\u2019s \n\n4 \n \n \napplication of rational-basis review is therefore as \nunnecessary as it is wrong.  As in other recent cases, the \nCourt should adhere to \u201csettled principles about \nfreedom of expression\u201d that have \u201cserved the Nation \nwell over many years\u201d and reject the Fifth Circuit\u2019s \njarring departure from First Amendment precedent.  \nMoody v. NetChoice, LLC, 144 S. Ct. 2383, 2403 (2024).   \nOPINIONS BELOW \nThe Fifth Circuit\u2019s opinion (Pet. App. 1a-87a) is \nreported at 95 F.4th 263.  The opinion of the district \ncourt granting a preliminary injunction (Pet. App. 90a-\n161a) is reported at 689 F. Supp. 3d 373. \nJURISDICTION \nThe Fifth Circuit entered its judgment on March 7, \n2024.  Petitioners timely petitioned for certiorari on \nApril 12, 2024.  This Court has jurisdiction under 28 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 1254(1). \nCONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY \nPROVISIONS INVOLVED \nThe First Amendment to the United States \nConstitution provides in relevant part that \u201cCongress \nshall make no law \u2026 abridging the freedom of speech.\u201d  \nH.B. 1181 is reproduced in an appendix to this brief. \nSTATEMENT \nA. Legal And Factual Background \n1.  \u201cThe most basic\u201d principle of free speech is that \n\u201cgovernment has no power to restrict expression \nbecause of its message, its ideas, its subject matter, or \nits content.\u201d  Brown v. Ent. Merchs. Ass\u2019n, 564 U.S. 786, \n790-91 (2011) (citation omitted).  Generally, when a law \n\u201cimposes a restriction on the content of protected \n\n5 \n \n \nspeech, it is invalid unless \u2026 it passes strict scrutiny\u2014\nthat is, unless it is justified by a compelling government \ninterest and is narrowly drawn to serve that interest.\u201d  \nId. at 799.  Otherwise, content-based speech restrictions \nare permitted only in limited \u201chistoric and traditional \ncategories long familiar to the bar.\u201d  United States v. \nStevens, 559 U.S. 460, 468 (2010) (citation omitted).   \nOne such category is obscenity, defined as material \nthat \n\u201cdepicts \nor \ndescribes \n\u2026 \nsexual \ncontent\u201d \n(specifically identified by statute), in a \u201cpatently \noffensive\u201d way that \u201cappeals to the prurient interest,\u201d \nand, taken as a whole, \u201clacks serious literary, artistic, \npolitical, or scientific value.\u201d  Miller v. California, 413 \nU.S. 15, 24 (1973) (citation omitted).  In Ginsberg, the \nCourt upheld a state law that \u201cadjusts the definition of \nobscenity\u201d applicable to minors based on their different \nreaction to sexual content.  Id. at 638 (citation omitted).  \nAs to adults, however, the Court has \u201cmade it perfectly \nclear that \u2018sexual expression which is \u2026 not obscene is \nprotected by the First Amendment.\u2019\u201d  Reno, 521 U.S. at \n874 (brackets and citation omitted).  And the Court has \nrepeatedly held that laws imposing content-based \nburdens on adults\u2019 access to such constitutionally \nprotected expression are subject to strict scrutiny, even \nif the laws permissibly aim to restrict minors\u2019 access to \nsuch material.  Id.; see Ashcroft, 542 U.S. at 665-66; \nPlayboy, 529 U.S. at 813; Sable, 492 U.S. at 126. \nThe Court\u2019s most recent decision in that line of cases \nis Ashcroft.  There, the Court considered a challenge to \nCOPA, \nwhich \nprohibited\u2014absent \nage-verification \nmeasures\u2014the online transmission of content that \nCongress deemed obscene for minors using a modified \nobscenity standard like the one at issue in Ginsberg.  \n542 U.S. at 661-62.  Because COPA burdened adults\u2019 \n\n6 \n \n \naccess to speech constitutionally protected for them, the \nCourt held that strict scrutiny applied for the same \nreasons as in analogous prior cases.  Id. at 665-66 (citing \nReno, 521 U.S. at 874); see id. at 670 (citing Playboy, \n529 U.S. at 825-26).  The Court then upheld a \npreliminary injunction of COPA, determining that the \nstatute was likely unconstitutional because \u201cless \nrestrictive \nalternatives\u201d\u2014in \nparticular, \ncontent-\nfiltering software\u2014\u201cwould be at least as effective in \nachieving the legitimate purpose that the statute was \nenacted to serve.\u201d  Id. at 665 (quoting Reno, 521 U.S. at \n874); see id. at 665-66, 673. \n2.  Almost 20 years after Ashcroft, in June 2023, \nTexas enacted H.B. 1181.  H.B. 1181 requires age \nverification by any commercial website \u201cmore than one-\nthird of which is sexual material harmful to minors,\u201d \nTex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code \u00a7 129B.002(a), defined \nusing almost exactly the same modification of the adult \nobscenity standard that Congress adopted in COPA, id. \n\u00a7 129B.001(6).1  Because this statutory definition \napplies to even the youngest minors, for whom almost \n \n1  \nSpecifically, H.B. 1181 defines \u201c[s]exual material harmful \nto minors\u201d as including material that \u201c(A) the average person \napplying contemporary community standards would find, taking \nthe material as a whole and with respect to minors, is designed to \nappeal to or pander to the prurient interest; (B) in a manner \npatently offensive with respect to minors, exploits, is devoted to, \nor principally consists of descriptions of actual, simulated, or \nanimated displays or depictions of: (i) a person\u2019s pubic hair, anus, \nor genitals or the nipple of the female breast; (ii) touching, \ncaressing, or fondling of nipples, breasts, buttocks, anuses, or \ngenitals; or (iii) sexual intercourse, masturbation, sodomy, \nbestiality, oral copulation, flagellation, excretory functions, \nexhibitions, or any other sexual act; and (C) taken as a whole, lacks \nserious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value for minors.\u201d \nTex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code \u00a7 129B.001(6). \n\n7 \n \n \nany sexual content could qualify as obscene, H.B. 1181 \ncovers \u201call salacious material,\u201d from sex-education \ncontent to simulated sex scenes in Oscar-winning films.  \nPet. App. 109a, 115a.  And because H.B. 1181 applies to \nany website that devotes any more than one-third of its \ncontent to such sexual material, its restrictions apply to \nbroad swaths of speech that are not sexual\u2014much less \nobscene, even as to minors.  \nH.B. 1181 also contains several conspicuous \nexemptions.  It expressly exempts search engines, Tex. \nCiv. Prac. & Rem. Code \u00a7 129B.005(b), even though they \ncan provide access to the same sexual content as \ncovered websites, see Pet. App. 112a.  And the law de \nfacto exempts social-media sites that contain less than \none-third sexual material, even if those sites contain a \nlarger total volume of sexual content (including the \nsame content) as covered websites.  Pet. App. 113a. \nTo comply with \nH.B. 1181\u2019s age-verification \nrequirement, covered websites must \u201cverify that an \nindividual attempting to access the [site] is\u201d at least 18 \nyears old using \u201cdigital identification,\u201d \u201cgovernment-\nissued identification,\u201d or \u201ca commercially reasonable \nmethod that relies on public or private transactional \ndata.\u201d  Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code \u00a7\u00a7 129B.002(a), \n129B.003.  An entity conducting age verification \u201cmay \nnot retain any identifying information of the individual,\u201d \nid. \u00a7 129B.002(b), but H.B. 1181 imposes no limits on \ntransmitting that information to others.  Nor does H.B. \n1181 establish any data-security requirements or \ndisclosure prohibitions for entities conducting age \nverification or others that receive identification \ninformation as part of the verification process. \nH.B. 1181 also mandates that covered websites post \nscripted \u201csexual materials health warnings\u201d on the \n\n8 \n \n \n\u201clanding page\u201d of the website and \u201call advertisements,\u201d \nalong with \u201chelpline\u201d numbers for \u201csubstance abuse and \nmental health.\u201d  Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code \n\u00a7 129B.004 (capitalization altered).  The purported \nwarnings state that \u201c[p]ornography is potentially \nbiologically addictive\u201d and \u201cproven to harm human \nbrain development.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 129B.004(1); see id. \n(\u201cExposure to this content is associated with low self-\nesteem and body image, eating disorders, impaired \nbrain development, and other emotional and mental \nillnesses.\u201d).  The statements are attributed to \u201cTEXAS \nHEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES,\u201d id., even \nthough that agency has not issued any such findings, \nPet. App. 95a.   \nNoncompliant websites are subject to enforcement \nactions by the Texas Attorney General and face \npenalties ranging from injunctive relief to fines of up to \n$10,000 per day, plus enhancements of up to $250,000.  \nTex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code \u00a7 129B.006. \n3.  Online age-verification mandated by H.B. 1181 \nposes severe risks to Internet users that do not arise \nduring in-person identification checks.  A \u201csubstantial \nchilling effect\u201d results from demanding proof of \nindividual identity online: Adults who submit, for \nexample, a \u201cgovernment ID\u201d over the Internet to \n\u201caffirmatively identify themselves\u201d understand that \nthey are thereby exposing themselves to \u201cinadvertent \ndisclosures, leaks, or hacks.\u201d  Pet. App. 125a-126a.  The \nchilling effect is worse than ever now because Internet \n\u201c[u]sers today are more cognizant of privacy concerns\u201d \nand \u201cdata breaches have become more high-profile\u201d and \ncommonplace.  Pet. App. 127a.  Adults\u2019 reasonable \nconcerns are compounded by H.B. 1181\u2019s failure to \nprohibit the transmission of adults\u2019 information to third \n\n9 \n \n \nparties\u2014including the government, creating the risk of \n\u201cstate monitoring\u201d of \u201cwhat kind of websites they visit.\u201d  \nPet. App. 125a-126a.  And H.B. 1181\u2019s deterrent effect \non adults\u2019 \u201caccess to sexual material\u201d is \u201cparticularly \nacute\u201d because it \u201ccan reveal intimate desires and \npreferences.\u201d  Pet. App. 125a.  Correspondingly, such \ninformation is \u201cmore likely to be targeted\u201d by identity \nthieves and extortionists because \u201cusers may be more \nwilling to pay to keep that information private.\u201d  Pet. \nApp. 127a. \nB. Procedural History \n1. District Court Proceedings \nPetitioners challenged H.B. 1181 soon after it was \nsigned.  Pet. App. 90a.  After an evidentiary hearing, the \ndistrict court issued an order preliminarily enjoining \nenforcement of H.B. 1181 before it became effective, \naccompanied by a lengthy decision explaining the \nfactual findings and legal reasoning underlying the \norder.  Pet. App. 90a-161a.  \na.  The district court held that petitioners are likely \nto succeed on the merits.  Under Reno and Ashcroft, the \ncourt explained, H.B. 1181 is subject to strict scrutiny \nbecause it is a content-based burden on adults\u2019 access to \nprotected speech.  Pet. App. 107a-111a.  While crediting \nTexas\u2019s compelling interest in protecting minors from \nharmful content, the court held that H.B. 1181\u2019s age-\nverification mandate likely does not withstand strict \nscrutiny because it is an underinclusive and overly \nrestrictive means of pursuing that interest, particularly \ngiven the availability of more effective, less restrictive \nalternatives.  Pet. App. 111a-136a.   \nThe district court first explained that H.B. 1181\u2019s \nexemptions of search engines and social media render it \n\n10 \n \n \n\u201cseverely underinclusive.\u201d  Pet. App. 112a-114a.  The \ncourt found that minors can easily locate \u201csexually \nexplicit or pornographic\u201d content on search engines \nthrough \u201cvisual search\u201d\u2014i.e., a search for images or \nvideos.  Pet. App. 112a.  The court also found that social-\nmedia platforms like Instagram and Facebook contain \n\u201cmaterial which is sexually explicit for minors,\u201d and \nsites like Reddit \u201cmaintain entire communities and \nforums\u201d devoted \u201cto posting online pornography.\u201d  Pet. \nApp. 113a.  Because such outlets are the most frequent \nsources for minors to access sexual content, yet none is \nregulated by H.B. 1181, the court found that the law \n\u201cfails to reduce the online pornography that is most \nreadily available to minors.\u201d  Pet. App. 113a.   \nThe district court similarly found that H.B. 1181\u2019s \nage-verification requirement is overly restrictive \nbecause it \u201csweeps far beyond obscene material and \nincludes all content offensive to minors, while failing to \nexempt material that has cultural, scientific, or \neducational value to adults only.\u201d  Pet. App. 122a.  The \ncourt added that the Texas legislature did not \u201ceven \nconsider[] the law\u2019s tailoring or ma[ke] any effort \nwhatsoever to choose the least-restrictive measure.\u201d  \nPet. App. 135a.  Indeed, the court found that Texas\u2019s \nown evidence\u2014along with petitioners\u2019\u2014identified less \nrestrictive and more effective alternatives.  In \nparticular, the legislature paid no heed to updated and \nimproved forms of the content-filtering software that \nthis Court found superior to online age-verification in \nAshcroft.  Pet. App. 128a-135a.  While Texas contended \nthat changes in technology should alter the judicial \nanalysis\u2014positing age verification as \u201cmore secure and \nconvenient\u201d and content filtering as obsolete\u2014the court \nfound that Texas\u2019s argument \u201csimply does not match \nthe evidence.\u201d  Pet. App. 127a.   \n\n11 \n \n \nb.  The district court also held that H.B. 1181\u2019s \nmandated health warnings are likely unconstitutionally \ncompelled speech.  Pet. App. 136a-150a.  Under \nNational Institute of Family and Life Advocates v. \nBecerra, 585 U.S. 755 (2018) (NIFLA), the court held \nthat the speech mandate is subject to strict scrutiny, \nwhich it likely cannot survive.  Pet. App. 137a-143a.  The \ncourt emphasized that, as a result of the age verification \nrequired by H.B. 1181, the warnings would be seen \npredominantly by adults, contrary to H.B. 1181\u2019s stated \npurpose of protecting minors.  Pet. App. 142a.  And even \nif the warnings are treated as a commercial-speech \nmandate subject to lesser scrutiny, the court held they \ncannot survive because they are not \u201cpurely factual and \nuncontroversial.\u201d  Pet. App. 145a (quoting Zauderer v. \nOff. of Disciplinary Couns., 471 U.S. 626, 651 (1985)). \nc.  Finally, the district court held that a preliminary \ninjunction is justified because H.B. 1181, if enforced, \nwill cause irreparable harm to petitioners and adult \nTexans by chilling access to protected sexual expression \nand compelling speech.  Pet. App. 156a.  In enjoining \nH.B. 1181, the court noted that \u201cnothing in th[e court\u2019s] \norder prevents the state from pursuing\u201d the other \n\u201cviable and constitutional means\u201d available \u201cto achieve \nTexas\u2019s goal\u201d of protecting minors.  Pet. App. 160a. \n2. Court Of Appeals Proceedings \na.  Texas appealed and sought a stay pending appeal \nfrom the Fifth Circuit.  See Pet. App. 167a-168a.  The \nmotions panel entered an administrative stay without \nany stated reasons, lasting nearly two months, during \nwhich time the parties briefed and argued the appeal.  \nPet. App. 167a-168a.  The merits panel then issued an \nunexplained stay pending appeal by a 2-1 vote, which \nlasted roughly another four months.  Pet. App. 166a & \n\n12 \n \n \nn.1 (noting Judge Higginbotham\u2019s dissenting vote).  \nDuring this period, Texas began enforcement actions.  \nSee C.A. Dkt. #131. \nb.  On March 7, 2024, the Fifth Circuit merits panel \nupheld the preliminary injunction unanimously as to the \nhealth-warning provision, Pet. App. 27a-38a, but held by \na 2-1 vote that petitioners were unlikely to succeed in \nchallenging the age-verification provision, Pet. App. 8a-\n27a.  The panel accordingly vacated the preliminary \ninjunction as to the age-verification provision over \nJudge Higginbotham\u2019s dissent.  Pet. App. 44a. \nThe panel majority acknowledged that H.B. 1181\u2019s \nage-verification requirement is \u201cvery similar\u201d to the \nCOPA provisions addressed by this Court in Ashcroft, \nrejecting Texas\u2019s purported distinctions of the two \nstatutes.  Pet. App. 16a.  Nevertheless, the majority \nheld that rational-basis review is the applicable \nstandard of scrutiny given Ginsberg.  Pet. App. 17a, 26a.  \nThe majority acknowledged that its holding departs \nfrom Ashcroft, but it declined to follow this Court\u2019s \ndecision in that case.  Pet. App. 16a-19a.  It deemed the \nAshcroft Court\u2019s lack of \u201cdiscussion of rational-basis \nreview under Ginsberg\u201d a \u201cstartling omission[]\u201d that \ncould \u201conly\u201d be explained by the failure of the United \nStates to argue for the application of rational-basis \nreview\u2014a non-jurisdictional error that the Court \npurportedly \u201cdid not have to correct\u201d on its own.  Pet. \nApp. 17a-18a.      \nThe panel majority similarly declined to apply other \nprecedents holding that strict scrutiny applies to \ncontent-based \nburdens \non \nadults\u2019 \naccess \nto \nconstitutionally protected sexual expression.  Pet. App. \n13a-16a, 20a-26a (discussing Reno, Playboy, and Sable).  \nThe majority contended that none of these cases could \n\n13 \n \n \n\u201csurmount the rock that is Ginsberg.\u201d  Pet. App. 20a.  \nThe majority then held that H.B. 1181\u2019s age-verification \nprovision \u201ceasily\u201d survives rational-basis review.  Pet. \nApp. 26a.   \nJudge Higginbotham dissented, relying on Sable, \nReno, Playboy, and Ashcroft.  Pet. App. 45a-87a.  H.B. \n1181 \u201cmust face strict scrutiny review,\u201d he explained, \n\u201cbecause it limits adults\u2019 access to protected speech \nusing a content-based distinction.\u201d  Pet. App. 47a-48a.  \nHe added that Ginsberg \u201chas no purchase\u201d in \naddressing \u201ca challenge to an adult\u2019s ability to access \nconstitutionally protected materials\u201d online, because \nGinsberg held \u201cthat minors have more limited First \nAmendment rights than adults.\u201d  Pet. App. 56a-57a.  \nFinding no clear error in the district court\u2019s findings, he \nwould have affirmed the preliminary injunction in full.  \nPet. App. 68a-78a.   \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nH.B. \n1181\u2019s \nage-verification \nrequirement \nis \nunconstitutional under a straightforward application of \nFirst Amendment principles and precedent.  The \npreliminary injunction should accordingly be restored. \nA.  When speech is protected by the First \nAmendment, a content-based burden on that speech \ntriggers strict scrutiny.  H.B. 1181\u2019s age-verification \nrequirement fits squarely within that rule.  The age-\nverification requirement is triggered by speech that \nTexas has deemed inappropriate for minors but that is \nconstitutionally protected for adults.  It is facially \ncontent-based, applying only to specified sexual \nmaterial.  And it imposes a clear burden, forcing adult \nusers to incur severe privacy and security risks\u2014which \n\n14 \n \n \nthe statute leaves largely unaddressed\u2014before they \ncan access constitutionally protected speech. \nBasic principles of free speech thus call for strict \nscrutiny.  And this Court\u2019s precedent removes all \ndoubt.  In an unbroken line of cases dating back \ndecades, the Court has uniformly applied strict scrutiny \nto laws that do what H.B. 1181 does\u2014burden adults\u2019 \naccess to non-obscene sexual content, which is \nconstitutionally protected for them, while attempting to \nrestrict minors\u2019 access to that content.  That line of \ncases culminated in Ashcroft, in which eight Justices \napplied \nstrict \nscrutiny \nto \na \nlaw \nmaterially \nindistinguishable from H.B. 1181. \nWithout attempting to distinguish Ashcroft, the \nFifth Circuit dismissed it by speculating that this Court \ndid not really mean that strict scrutiny applies to laws \nlike COPA and H.B. 1181.  That position is as \nremarkable as it is mistaken.  Lower federal courts \nmay not disregard this Court\u2019s decisions, even if they \n(mis)perceive \n\u201comissions\u201d \nin \nthe \nCourt\u2019s \nreasoning.  Pet. App. 17a.  Regardless, Ashcroft \nevidences no omission.  The Ashcroft Court subjected \nCOPA to strict scrutiny because that is what the First \nAmendment requires, as the United States recognized \nin defending the statute.  The Court did not adopt the \nrational-basis review standard of Ginsberg, because \nthat standard applies to the definition of obscenity for \nminors\u2014not the imposition of burdens on adults, as this \nCourt\u2019s post-Ginsberg decisions in Reno, Playboy, and \nSable confirm. \nB.  Under the proper standard of strict scrutiny, \nthis case is readily resolved.  As the district court found \nand the Fifth Circuit did not refute, H.B. 1181\u2019s age-\nverification requirement is triply flawed: it is \n\n15 \n \n \noverinclusive, underinclusive, and not the least \nrestrictive means of pursuing the state\u2019s interest in \nprotecting minors.  It is overinclusive because\u2014\nthrough its application to entire websites that have \nmore than one-third content inappropriate for minors\u2014\nit restricts adults\u2019 access to speech that is not even \nsexual and not even arguably obscene for minors.  It is \nunderinclusive because it exempts search engines and \nsocial-media sites that make available to minors huge \nquantities of the same content that the statute restricts \non petitioners\u2019 websites.  And it fails to adopt less \nrestrictive \nand \nmore \neffective \nalternatives \nto \nburdensome online age-verification, such as the \ncontent-filtering software that this Court identified in \nAshcroft.  Each of those defects is independently fatal; \ntogether, they underscore that H.B. 1181 is designed \nforemost to target disfavored speakers\u2014whom the law \nbrands with self-condemning \u201chealth warnings\u201d\u2014\nrather than to meet the state\u2019s purported objective.  \nSuch speaker-based discrimination affords yet another \nreason why petitioners\u2019 challenge will likely succeed. \nC.  Petitioners satisfy the remaining requirements \nfor a preliminary injunction.  They, along with Texas \nadults, are irreparably harmed by the loss of their First \nAmendment freedoms and the prospect of crippling \nenforcement \nproceedings \nand \nunrecoverable \ncompliance costs.  Moreover, the equities and public \ninterest strongly favor enjoining enforcement of the \nstatute until the litigation is complete\u2014just as was true \nfor the comparable laws in Reno and Ashcroft. \n\n16 \n \n \nARGUMENT \nTHE PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION OF THE AGE-\nVERIFICATION REQUIREMENT IN H.B. 1181 \nSHOULD BE RESTORED \nA \u201cplaintiff seeking a preliminary injunction must \nestablish that he is likely to succeed on the merits, that \nhe is likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of \npreliminary relief, that the balance of equities tips in his \nfavor, and that an injunction is in the public interest.\u201d  \nWinter v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 20 \n(2008).  Here, as in most First Amendment cases, the \nprincipal \nquestion \nis \nwhether \npetitioners \nhave \n\u201cdemonstrated that they are likely to succeed on the \nmerits.\u201d  Ashcroft, 542 U.S. at 666.  As the district court \ncorrectly concluded, they have.  Because petitioners \nalso satisfy the relevant equitable factors, the \npreliminary injunction should be restored.  See Pet. App. \n45a-87a (Higginbotham, J., dissenting). \nA. The Age-Verification Requirement In H.B. \n1181 Is Subject To Strict Scrutiny \n1. Strict Scrutiny Applies To Content-Based \nBurdens On Protected Speech  \na.  \u201cThe First Amendment, applicable to the States \nthrough the Fourteenth Amendment, prohibits laws \nthat abridge the freedom of speech.\u201d  NIFLA, 585 U.S. \nat 766. It is a \u201cfundamental principle\u201d of the First \nAmendment that states typically cannot restrict \nprotected speech \u201cbecause of its message, its ideas, its \nsubject matter, or its content.\u201d  NIFLA, 585 U.S. at 766 \n(quoting Police Dept. v. Mosley, 408 U.S. 92, 95 (1972)).  \nSuch restrictions \u201care presumptively unconstitutional\u201d \nand generally may be justified only if they overcome the \n\u201cstringent standard\u201d of strict scrutiny.  Id.  The Court \n\n17 \n \n \nhas applied that principle to speech of many different \nforms, from outdoor signs to violent video games to \ndepictions of animal cruelty to sexually suggestive \ncontent on television and the Internet\u2014just to name a \nfew examples from recent years.  See Reed v. Town of \nGilbert, 576 U.S. 155, 159 (2015); Brown, 564 U.S. at 799; \nStevens, 559 U.S. at 468-69; Playboy, 529 U.S. at 813-14; \nReno, 521 U.S. at 874; see also Barr v. Am. Ass\u2019n of Pol. \nConsultants, Inc., 591 U.S. 610, 618-19 (2020) (plurality \nopinion) (applying strict scrutiny to restrictions on \nrobocalls); id. at 650 (Gorsuch, J., concurring in the \njudgment in part and dissenting in part) (same).  In \nshort, the First Amendment generally \u201cbars the \ngovernment from dictating what we see or read or \nspeak or hear.\u201d  Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coal., 535 U.S. \n234, 245 (2002).  \nThe First Amendment confers that broad protection \nnot because any \u201cone idea is as good as any other\u201d;  the \n\u201cConstitution no more enforces a relativistic philosophy \nor moral nihilism than it does any other point of view.\u201d  \nPlayboy, 529 U.S. at 818.  The First Amendment \nbroadly protects speech because \u201cit is difficult to \ndistinguish\u201d high-value speech from low-value speech \nand \u201cdangerous\u201d for the government \u201cto try.\u201d  Brown, \n564 U.S. at 790.  \u201cWhat is one man\u2019s amusement, \nteaches another\u2019s doctrine.\u201d  Id. (quoting Winters v. \nNew York, 333 U.S. 507, 510 (1948)).  The First \nAmendment \u201cexists precisely so that opinions and \njudgments, including esthetic and moral judgments \nabout art and literature, can be formed, tested, and \nexpressed.\u201d  Playboy, 529 U.S. at 818.  And, with few \nexceptions, those \u201cjudgments are for the individual to \nmake, not for the Government to decree, even with the \nmandate or approval of a majority.\u201d  Id. \n\n18 \n \n \nb.  The Court has long applied these principles to \nspeech involving sex.  Although obscenity is historically \nunprotected, \u201csex and obscenity are not synonymous,\u201d \nand the non-obscene \u201cportrayal of sex \u2026 in art, \nliterature, and scientific works\u201d has never been \nregarded as \u201csufficient reason to deny material the \nconstitutional protection of freedom of speech and \npress.\u201d  Roth v. United States, 354 U.S. 476, 487 (1957).  \nTo the contrary, sex has been \u201ca subject of absorbing \ninterest to mankind through the ages\u201d and remains \u201cone \nof the vital problems of human interest and public \nconcern.\u201d  Id.; see, e.g., Reno, 521 U.S. at 877-78 \n(collecting examples of sexual material \u201cwith serious \neducational or other value\u201d); see also Free Speech Coal., \n535 U.S. at 246-48 (2002) (discussing the theme of sex in \nart and literature dating back to Shakespeare).   \n\u201cSexual expression and imagery were common, \nwidespread, legal, and quite explicit\u201d before and during \nthe Founding era.  Geoffrey R. Stone, Sex and the First \nAmendment, 17 First Amend. L. Rev. 134, 135 (2022).  \nAmerican colonial bookstores \u201ccarried an extraordinary \narray of erotica,\u201d id., and prominent figures \u201clike \nBenjamin Franklin and Thomas Jefferson collected \nmany [such] works,\u201d Geoffrey R. Stone, Sex and the \nConstitution 83 (2017).  Jefferson\u2019s library, for example, \ncontained numerous publications that \u201cportrayed vivid \nscenes of sexuality, lust, and sexual scandal.\u201d  Id.; see 4 \nCatalogue of the Library of Thomas Jefferson 433-36, \n447, 456, 553-54 (E. Millicent Sowerby ed., 1955).  And \nmany Americans \u201cread sex manuals\u201d such as Aristotle\u2019s \nMasterpiece\u2014an \u201cerotic\u201d anthology understood to have \nmedical value.  Vern L. Bullough, An Early American \nSex Manual, Or, Aristotle Who?, 7 Early Am. \nLiterature 236, 236, 241 (1973); see John D\u2019Amelio & \nEstelle B. Freedman, Intimate Matters: A History of \n\n19 \n \n \nSexuality in America 19 (1988) (describing that \u201chighly \npopular\u201d work as \u201ca compendium of reproductive lore\u201d).  \nObjections to such non-obscene sexual publications on \nreligious, moral, aesthetic, and other grounds were \ngenerally pursued through private restrictions, not \npublic laws; \u201cthe distribution, exhibition, and possession \nof pornographic material was simply not thought to be \nany of the state\u2019s business.\u201d  Sex and the First \nAmendment, supra, at 135.   \nIn keeping with that history and understanding, this \nCourt has exercised \u201c[c]easeless vigilance\u201d to protect \nadults\u2019 access to sexual material that does not fall within \nthe definition of obscenity, Roth, 354 U.S. at 488, even \nthough some may \u201cfind [it] shabby, offensive, or even \nugly,\u201d Playboy, 529 U.S. at 826.  That is consistent with \nthe \n\u201cbedrock \nprinciple \nunderlying \nthe \nFirst \nAmendment \u2026 that the government may not prohibit \nthe expression of an idea simply because society finds \nthe idea itself offensive or disagreeable.\u201d  Snyder v. \nPhelps, 562 U.S. 443, 458 (2011) (quoting Texas v. \nJohnson, 491 U.S. 397, 414 (1989)); see Free Speech \nCoal., 535 U.S. at 245 (\u201c[S]peech may not be prohibited \nbecause \nit \nconcerns \nsubjects \noffending \nour \nsensibilities.\u201d).  Indeed, \u201cthe point of all speech \nprotection ... is to shield just those choices of content \nthat in someone\u2019s eyes are misguided, or even hurtful.\u201d  \nSnyder, 562 U.S. at 458 (citation omitted); see 303 \nCreative LLC v. Elenis, 600 U.S. 570, 602 (2023) (\u201cA \ncommitment to speech for only some messages and \nsome persons is no commitment at all.\u201d). \nc.  The distinction between unprotected obscenity \nand protected speech about sex applies to people of all \nages.  In Ginsberg, however, this Court held that the \nline can be drawn in a different place with respect to \n\n20 \n \n \nminors.  390 U.S. at 638.  The Court in Ginsberg upheld \na New York law that prohibited the knowing sale to \nminors of sexual material \u201cdefined to be obscene on the \nbasis of its appeal to them whether or not it would be \nobscene to adults.\u201d  Id. at 631.  Rejecting a challenge \nasserted on behalf of minors, the Court determined that \nthe law permissibly \u201cadjusts the definition of obscenity \n\u2018to social realities by permitting the appeal of this type \nof material to be assessed in term of the sexual \ninterests\u2019\u201d of minors, which differ from those of adults.  \nId. at 638 (quoting Mishkin v. New York, 383 U.S. 502, \n509 (1966)).  Because the line drawn by the state has a \n\u201crational relation to the objective of safeguarding such \nminors from harm,\u201d the Court held, the law did not \nviolate minors\u2019 First Amendment rights.  Id. at 643. \nThe Court\u2019s decision in Ginsberg marks an exception \nto the general principle that minors and adults enjoy the \nsame First Amendment protections, and the Court has \ndeclined to extend Ginsberg beyond the narrow context \nin which it was decided.  See Brown, 564 U.S. at 793-95 \n(rejecting California\u2019s reliance on Ginsberg to prohibit \nthe sale of violent video games to minors).  Most \ncritically for present purposes, however, Ginsberg\u2019s \ntolerance of a more restrictive obscenity definition for \nminors does not in any way diminish the constitutional \nprotection of non-obscene sexual expression for adults.  \nThe law at issue in Ginsberg did not place any \nrestriction on adults\u2019 access to sexual materials; it did \nnot, for example, require sellers to conduct age \nverification of adult customers.  See 390 U.S. at 634.  To \nthe \ncontrary, \nthe \nGinsberg \nCourt \nexpressly \ndistinguished New York\u2019s restriction on minors\u2019 access \nto sexual content from a Michigan law that barred the \nsale to adults and minors of content deemed harmful to \nminors, id.\u2014a law the Court unanimously invalidated as \n\n21 \n \n \nviolating the First Amendment.  Butler v. Michigan, \n352 U.S. 380, 383-84 (1957) (refusing to \u201creduce the \nadult population of Michigan to reading only what is fit \nfor children,\u201d which would impermissibly \u201cburn the \nhouse to roast the pig\u201d). \nThe Court has since reaffirmed in an unbroken line \nof ensuing decisions that a burden on adults\u2019 access to \nsexual material constitutionally protected for them is \nsubject to strict scrutiny even if that burden arises from \na law aimed at restricting minors\u2019 access to sexual \nmaterial that is not constitutionally protected for them.  \nSee, e.g., Reno, 521 U.S. at 975 (\u201c[T]he level of discourse \nreaching a mailbox simply cannot be limited to that \nwhich would be suitable for a sandbox.\u201d (quoting Bolger \nv. Youngs Drug Prods. Corp., 463 U.S. 60, 74-75 (1983)).   \nIn Sable, for example, the Court considered a \nfederal law prohibiting \u201cdial-a-porn\u201d telephone services \ncontaining content that was constitutionally protected \nfor adults but inappropriate for minors.  492 U.S. at 117, \n126.  Given the burden on adults, the Court subjected \nthe law to strict scrutiny.  Id. at 126.  And while the \nCourt accepted the government\u2019s \u201ccompelling interest \nin protecting the physical and psychological well-being \nof minors,\u201d the Court invalidated the law because it \n\u201cwas not sufficiently narrowly drawn \u2026 to serve those \ninterests without unnecessarily interfering with [the] \nFirst Amendment freedoms\u201d of adults.  Id. \nThe Court followed the same approach in Playboy.  \nThere, a federal law required cable-television operators \noffering \nchannels \n\u201cprimarily \ndedicated \nto\u201d \nprogramming that was \u201csexually-oriented\u201d but not \nobscene for adults to either block their channels or \nbroadcast them only late at night, when children were \nnot likely to be watching.  529 U.S. at 806.  The Court \n\n22 \n \n \nagain acknowledged the government\u2019s interest in \nstopping \u201cunwanted, indecent speech\u201d from entering \n\u201cthe home without parental consent,\u201d but emphasized \nthat, because the law burdened adults\u2019 access to sexual \nexpression that is constitutionally protected for them, \nthe \u201cstandard the Government must meet\u201d to restrict \nthat speech \u201cshould be clear:  The standard is strict \nscrutiny.\u201d  Id. at 814.  The Court rejected the argument \nthat a lower level of scrutiny should apply because \nadults could still watch the programming late at night; \nthe Court explained that \u201c[t]he Government\u2019s content-\nbased burdens must satisfy the same rigorous scrutiny \nas its content-based bans.\u201d  Id. at 812.  After finding \nthat effective, less restrictive alternatives existed\u2014for \nexample, \u201ca regime in which viewers could order signal \nblocking on a household-by-household basis\u201d\u2014the \nCourt invalidated the law.  Id. at 807, 826-27. \nIn Reno, the Court extended those principles to \nsexual content specifically on the Internet.  The Court \naffirmed a preliminary injunction of a federal law that \n\u201cprohibit[ed] the knowing transmission of obscene or \nindecent messages\u201d online \u201cto any recipient under 18 \nyears of age,\u201d unless certain age-verification measures \nwere employed.  Reno, 521 U.S. at 859-61.  While \nrecognizing Ginsberg\u2019s holding that the \u201cscope of the \nconstitutional freedom of expression secured to a citizen\u201d \nto access sexually explicit material may \u201cdepend on \nwhether the citizen is an adult or a minor,\u201d the Reno \nCourt followed Playboy and Sable by applying strict \nscrutiny to the statute because it burdened adults\u2019 \naccess to speech that was constitutionally protected for \nthem.  Id. at 864-65, 874-77.  The Court affirmed the \npreliminary injunction, noting the government had \nfailed \u201cto explain why a less restrictive\u201d measure such \n\n23 \n \n \nas content \u201ctagg[ing],\u201d a nascent form of content \nfiltering, would not similarly protect minors.  Id. at 879. \nMost recently, the Court applied the same principles \nto COPA in Ashcroft.  As noted above, COPA prohibited \nthe online transmission of content deemed obscene for \nminors\u2014using Miller\u2019s adult-obscenity standard from \nthe perspective of a minor\u2014unless age-verification \nmeasures were employed.  See pp. 5-6, supra.  As in \nReno, Playboy, and Sable, the Ashcroft Court applied \nstrict scrutiny based on the law\u2019s burden on adults\u2019 \naccess to protected speech.  542 U.S. at 665-66.  The \nCourt then affirmed a preliminary injunction of COPA.  \nIt explained that the use of \u201cblocking and filtering \nsoftware\u201d would be an effective and less restrictive \nmeans of restricting minors\u2019 access to online sexual \ncontent inappropriate for them, while still allowing \nadults to access the \u201cspeech they have a right to see \nwithout having to identify themselves\u201d and thereby \nincur \u201cthe potential chilling effect\u201d of age verification.  \nId. at 666-67.2 \nTaken together, the teaching of those cases is \nunmistakable:  Strict scrutiny applies to laws that \nburden adults\u2019 right to access sexual expression that is \nconstitutionally protected for them, even if those laws \nare aimed at preventing minors\u2019 exposure to that \ncontent.  Indeed, prior to the majority decision below, \nevery court of appeals that encountered a similar law \nreviewed it under strict scrutiny.  See Mukasey, 534 F.3d \nat 190; PSInet v. Chapman, 362 F.3d 227, 229, 233-34 \n \n2  Following remand, the district court permanently enjoined \nCOPA, the Third Circuit affirmed under strict scrutiny, and this \nCourt denied review.  See ACLU v. Mukasey, 534 F.3d 181, 190, \n207 (3d Cir. 2008), cert. denied, 555 U.S. 1137 (2009). \n\n24 \n \n \n(4th Cir. 2004); Am. Booksellers Found. v.

H.B. 1181\u2019s Age-Verification Requirement \nIs A Content-Based Burden On Protected \nSpeech Subject To Strict Scrutiny \nLike the laws in Ashcroft, Playboy, Reno, and Sable, \nH.B. 1181\u2019s age-verification requirement applies to \nspeech that is constitutionally protected for adults and \nimposes a content-based burden on adults\u2019 access to \nthat speech.  It is therefore subject to strict scrutiny.   \na.  The speech covered by H.B. 1181\u2019s age-\nverification requirement is constitutionally protected \nfor adults.  Like COPA, H.B. 1181 applies to speech that \nsatisfies the Miller adult-obscenity test modified to \ncover sexual material that is deemed harmful from the \nperspective of a minor.  Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code \n\u00a7 129B.001(6); see Ashcroft, 542 U.S. at 661-62.  H.B. \n1181, moreover, applies to minors generally\u2014with no \ndistinction between, e.g., a 17-year-old and a 5-year-\nold\u2014so content that would be harmful to even the \nyoungest minor is covered by the statute.  \u201cBecause \nmost sexual content is offensive to young minors, the \nlaw covers virtually all salacious material,\u201d Pet App. \n109a, from nude modeling to romance novels to R-rated \nmovies or television shows for mature audiences, id. at \n51a-52a (Higginbotham, J., dissenting).  That material \nis all undisputedly protected for adults. \nNor is H.B. 1181 directed at speech that is obscene \nfor adults.  Texas separately criminalizes such obscenity, \nleaving no need to subject it to age verification.  Tex. \nPenal Code \u00a7\u00a7 43.21-43.23.  As such, adult obscenity is \nnot part of the constitutional analysis.  See Free Speech \n\n25 \n \n \nCoal., 535 U.S. at 240 (not considering obscene speech \nin the constitutional analysis because the statute at \nissue \u201cis not directed at speech that is obscene\u201d and \n\u201cCongress has proscribed those materials through a \nseparate statute\u201d); Reno, 521 U.S. at 878 n.44 (similar).  \nThe point is so plain that Texas conceded it at oral \nargument below.  Asked whether \u201cthe state take[s] the \nposition that the adults should be able to access all of \nth[e] material\u201d covered by H.B. 1181, or instead \u201cthat \nsome of th[e covered material] is obscene,\u201d the state \nresponded: \u201cadults should still be able to access every \nbit of the materials.\u201d  Official Recording at 13:35-14:00, \nhttps://bit.ly/4c5B42K. \nb.  It is equally clear that H.B. 1181\u2019s age-\nverification requirement is content-based.  The \nrequirement applies only to websites that provide \n\u201csexual material harmful to minors.\u201d  Tex. Civ. Prac. & \nRem. Code \u00a7\u00a7 129B.001(6), 129B.002(a).  This definition \nis content-based on its face and indistinguishable from \nthe one that triggered strict scrutiny in Ashcroft; it is \nlikewise of a piece with the restrictions that triggered \nstrict scrutiny in Reno, Playboy, and Sable.  What is \nmore, H.B. 1181\u2019s content-based definition is especially \nbroad:  it sweeps in all of a website\u2019s non-sexual content \njust because more than one-third of the website \ncontains the targeted sexual content.  Tex. Civ. Prac. & \nRem. Code \u00a7 129B.002(a).3   \nc.  Nor can there be any serious dispute that H.B. \n1181\u2019s age-verification requirement imposes a burden.  \nCovered websites must require adults to provide their \n \n3  The \u201chealth-warnings\u201d mandate likewise applies based on \nthe content of websites\u2019 speech and further compels the utterance \nof particular words.  Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code \u00a7 129B.004.   \n\n26 \n \n \npersonally identifying information whenever they wish \nto access constitutionally protected sexual speech.  As \nis clear from the district court\u2019s unchallenged \nfindings\u2014along with common sense and experience\u2014\nmany adults will understandably be reluctant to do so.  \nPet. \nApp. \n124a-127a. \n \nSubmitting \nidentifying \ninformation online entails risks of \u201cinadvertent \ndisclosures, leaks, or hacks,\u201d all of which are heightened \nbecause the disclosure of personal information here \ncould \u201creveal intimate desires and preferences.\u201d  Pet. \nApp. 125a-126a; see Electronic Frontier Found. (EFF) \nCert. Amicus Br. 6 (elaborating security risks). \nH.B. 1181 does little to assuage these concerns.  \nWhile requiring that age-verification providers \u201cmay \nnot retain any identifying information,\u201d Tex. Civ. Prac. \n& Rem. Code \u00a7 129B.002(b), H.B. 1181 does not prohibit \nthe transmission of such information to third parties, \nincluding to criminals or the state.  It is \u201cdubious,\u201d \nmoreover, that adults will \u201ctrust that companies will \nactually delete it.\u201d  Pet. App. 126a.  Beyond creating \nrisks of potentially devastating identify theft and \nextortion, the law ushers in the chilling prospect that \n\u201cthe state government can log and track adults\u2019 access \nto sexual material.\u201d  Pet. App. 75a (Higginbotham, J., \ndissenting).  And even if those worst-case scenarios are \nnot realized, their specter will have a significant (and \nostensibly designed) deterrent effect.  Pet. App. 126a; \nsee, e.g., Denver Area Educ. Telecomms. Consortium, \nInc. v. FCC, 518 U.S. 727, 754 (1996) (crediting such \nrisks in the context of adults\u2019 access to sexual content).4   \n \n4   The \u201chealth-warnings mandate,\u201d which demands that \nwebsites stigmatize and condemn adult users by \u201cwarning\u201d them \naway, confirms that such deterrence is by design. \n\n27 \n \n \nFor many adults, moreover, H.B. 1181 \u201coperates as \na de facto ban.\u201d  Found. for Individual Rights and \nExpression (FIRE) Cert. Amicus Br. 8.  \u201cTexans who do \nnot possess government identification or whose age or \nidentity are not reliably confirmed by commercial age-\nverification systems will be functionally prohibited from \nvisiting sites\u201d subject to the law.  Id.  This is not \nhypothetical: \u201c[a]bout 15 million adult citizens do not \nhave a driver\u2019s license, while about 2.6 million do not \nhave any form of government-issued photo ID.\u201d  EFF \nCert. Amicus Br. 10.  \nIn sum, H.B. 1181\u2019s age-verification requirement \nimposes a content-based burden on the right of adults \nto access speech that is constitutionally protected for \nthem.  Under this Court\u2019s consistent precedent, H.B. \n1181 is therefore subject to strict scrutiny.  See p. 24, \nsupra; see also Pet. App. 47a-48a (Higginbotham, J., \ndissenting); Pet. App. 108a.   \n3. The Fifth Circuit Erred In Applying \nRational-Basis Review To H.B. 1181\u2019s Age-\nVerification Requirement  \nThe Fifth Circuit declined to follow this Court\u2019s well-\nestablished precedent, applying rational-basis review \nrather than strict scrutiny.  Although the court provided \nseveral justifications for its position, none has merit. \na.  As a threshold matter, the Fifth Circuit squarely \ndefied this Court\u2019s decision in Ashcroft, which the panel \nmajority acknowledged applied strict scrutiny to a \nmaterially indistinguishable law.  Pet. App. 4a, 16a.  The \nmajority\u2019s stated basis for doing so was that Ashcroft\u2019s \nfailure to apply rational-basis review under Ginsberg \nwas a \u201cstartling omission[]\u201d that could be explained only \nby the United States\u2019 failure to argue that rational-basis \n\n28 \n \n \nreview applied to COPA; on that view, the majority \ndeemed itself free to adopt a different approach and to \ncredit Texas\u2019s proposal for applying rational-basis \nreview here.  Pet. App. 17a, 26a.  That was not the \ncorrect treatment of this Court\u2019s precedent. \nTo begin, lower federal courts are bound by the \nreasoning and result of this Court\u2019s decisions under the \nprinciple of \u201cvertical stare decisis.\u201d  Ramos v. \nLouisiana, 590 U.S. 83, 124 n.5 (2020) (Kavanaugh, J., \nconcurring in part); see, e.g., Seminole Tribe v. Florida, \n517 U.S. 44, 67 (1996) (\u201cWhen an opinion issues for the \nCourt, it is not only the result but also those portions of \nthe opinion necessary to that result by which we are \nbound.\u201d).  As such, the Fifth Circuit was not free to \ndisregard Ashcroft or any other decision of this Court \nbased on perceived weaknesses in the Court\u2019s analysis.  \nSee, e.g., Agostini v. Felton, 521 U.S. 203, 237 (1997).   \nIn any event, the Fifth Circuit\u2019s reading of Ashcroft \nis wrong.  The United States\u2019 brief in Ashcroft makes \nclear that the reason the government declined to argue \nfor rational-basis review was not an oversight but \ninstead a recognition that this Court had clearly and \nrepeatedly held that strict scrutiny applies to laws like \nCOPA.  See U.S. Br. 18, Ashcroft, supra (No. 03-218) \n(\u201c[B]ecause [COPA] regulates on the basis of content, \n[it] \u2018must be narrowly tailored to promote a compelling \ngovernment interest\u2019 in order to be constitutional under \nthe First Amendment.\u201d (quoting Playboy, 529 U.S. at \n813)).  The Court\u2019s decision in Ashcroft reflects that \nsame understanding.  Eight Justices in Ashcroft applied \nstrict scrutiny: the five Justices in the majority and \nthree of the dissenters, who would have upheld COPA \nunder strict scrutiny.  542 U.S. at 670; see id. at 677 \n(Breyer, J., dissenting, joined by Rehnquist, C.J., and \n\n29 \n \n \nO\u2019Connor, J.).  Only Justice Scalia\u2019s dissent would have \nsubjected COPA to less than strict scrutiny, contending \nthat the covered speech was unprotected and thus \npresumably subject to rational-basis review.  Id. at 676.  \nThat Justice Scalia advocated that position while eight \nJustices concluded otherwise refutes the Fifth Circuit\u2019s \naccount of a \u201cstartling omission[].\u201d  Pet. App. 17a. \nFurthermore, it is implausible that this Court would \nhave felt itself constrained to apply the wrong tier of \nconstitutional scrutiny simply because the parties \npurportedly invoked the wrong legal standard.  Parties \ncannot \u201cstipulate or bind [a court] to the application of \nan incorrect legal standard.\u201d  NetChoice, 144 S. Ct. at \n2429 (Alito, J., concurring in the judgment) (citations \nomitted). At a minimum, it is highly unlikely that the \nCourt would have adopted such a position in a major \nconstitutional case without explaining that it was doing \nso only because of the parties\u2019 arguments\u2014especially \nwhen the precise issue was squarely raised by the \ndissent.  Cf. Haaland v. Brackeen, 599 U.S. 255, 279-80 \n(2023) (explaining that the Court was deferring to the \nparties\u2019 presentation of the arguments); McCullen v. \nCoakley, 573 U.S. 464, 478 (2014) (stating that the Court \nwould \u201cassume, without deciding, that\u201d a particular \n\u201clevel of scrutiny\u201d applied). \nb.  In addition to misreading Ashcroft, the Fifth \nCircuit also misread Ginsberg.  The panel majority \ndrastically reduced the applicable standard from strict \nscrutiny to rational-basis review on the theory that such \na result was necessary to afford continuing vitality to \nGinsberg.  See Pet. App. 19a-20a.  But no such straining \nis necessary to give meaning to Ginsberg.   \nProperly understood, Ginsberg stands for the \nimportant but limited proposition that states can define \n\n30 \n \n \nobscenity more broadly for minors than for adults, and \nthus can restrict minors\u2019 access to a broader range of \nsexual content than they can permissibly restrict for \nadults.  390 U.S. at 638; see Brown, 564 U.S. at 793-94 \n(describing Ginsberg in those terms); Pet. App. 55a, 68a \n(Higginbotham, J., dissenting) (same).  That holding \nreflects the government\u2019s \u201csomewhat broader authority \nto regulate the activities of children,\u201d Planned \nParenthood v. Danforth, 428 U.S. 52, 74-75 (1976) \n(citing Ginsberg, 390 U.S. at 629), but it does not affect \nthe state\u2019s authority to regulate access by adults to \ncontent that is constitutionally protected for them. \nThe Fifth Circuit\u2019s contrary reading does not find \nadequate roots in Ginsberg.  As explained above, \nGinsberg did not involve a law that burdened the speech \nrights of adults while restricting access for minors.  See \npp. 20-21, supra.  The law barred only \u201cknowing[]\u201d sales \nto minors and did not prescribe age verification in any \nform, let alone across all transactions, or otherwise \nrestrict adults\u2019 access.  Ginsberg, 390 U.S. at 633-34.  So \nlong as a vendor did not sell to someone appearing to be \na minor, the law had nothing to say.  See id. at 643-44.  \nThat is why the vendor in Ginsberg appealed his \nconviction by invoking the rights of minors, not adults.  \nSee id. at 636 (\u201c[H]is contention is \u2026 that the scope of \nthe constitutional freedom of expression secured to a \ncitizen to read or see material concerned with sex \ncannot be made to depend upon whether the citizen is \nan adult or a minor.\u201d); see Appellant Br., Ginsberg, \nsupra (No. 47, O.T. 1967), 1967 WL 113634, at *7 (\u201cThe \nappellant\u2019s position is that the restriction on the \ndistribution of literature based on age classification is \ncensorship, pure and simple.\u201d).  The Court rejected the \nargument on those terms, holding that \u201cthe concept of \nobscenity \u2026 may vary according to the group to whom \n\n31 \n \n \nthe questionable material is directed or from whom it is \nquarantined.\u201d  390 U.S. at 636 (citation omitted).  To be \nsure, if the challenge in this case rested on the \nproposition that minors have rights to view sexual \ncontent covered by H.B. 1181, Ginsberg might be \nrelevant.  Recognizing Ginsberg\u2019s continued vitality in \nsuch a circumstance gives that precedent the force it is \ndue, no more and no less.   \nThe \nFifth \nCircuit\u2019s \nposition, \nby \ncontrast, \ncontravenes the decades of precedents after Ginsberg \nthat applied strict scrutiny to laws restricting the \nspeech rights of adults alongside minors.  See pp. 20-24, \nsupra.  Indeed, no other court in the 20 years since \nAshcroft or the 56 years since Ginsberg has even \nsuggested anything like the position adopted by the \nFifth Circuit here.  And the only case addressing such a \nlaw after the Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision relies on Ashcroft \nand Judge Higginbotham\u2019s dissent rather than the \nFifth Circuit majority opinion.  Free Speech Coal., Inc. \nv. Rokita,      F. Supp. 3d     , 2024 WL 3228197, at *7-16 \n(S.D. Ind. June 28, 2024).  Reviewing a nearly identical \nage-verification provision, the district court in that case \nheld that the \u201ccase is not close\u201d and that the law is a \n\u201cdead ringer\u201d for the statute addressed by this Court in \nAshcroft.  Id. at *18.  The court rejected the state\u2019s \nattempts to evade strict scrutiny, which the court held \nis dictated by \u201ceach of\u201d this Court\u2019s cases addressing \nstatutes that burden adults in the course of \u201cseeking to \nprotect \nminors \nfrom \nindecent \nwire \ncommunications.\u201d  Id. at *13.5   \n \n5   On appeal, the Seventh Circuit stayed the resulting \npreliminary injunction without \u201cconsidering the standards \nappropriate to a stay pending appeal on the merits,\u201d on the theory \n \n\n32 \n \n \nc.  The Fifth Circuit briefly suggested that strict \nscrutiny does not apply for the additional reason that \nH.B. 1181\u2019s age-verification requirement constitutes \nonly a speech burden rather than a speech ban.  Pet. \nApp. 16a n.23.  But this Court has never required that a \ncontent-based law actually ban speech to trigger strict \nscrutiny.  To the contrary, the Court has confirmed \nmany times\u2014including in the context of laws restricting \nadults\u2019 access to constitutionally protected sexual \nexpression\u2014that \u201c[t]he Government\u2019s content-based \nburdens must satisfy the same rigorous scrutiny as its \ncontent-based bans.\u201d  Playboy, 529 U.S. at 812 \n(emphases added); see, e.g., Reed, 576 U.S. at 171-72 \n(applying strict scrutiny not to a ban on speech but to a \nregulation governing the size of political signs); Simon \n& Schuster, Inc. v. Members of N.Y. State Crime \nVictims Bd., 502 U.S. 105, 115 (1991) (\u201cA statute is \npresumptively inconsistent with the First Amendment \nif it imposes a financial burden on speakers because of \nthe content of their speech.\u201d); cf. Sorrell v. IMS Health \nInc., 564 U.S. 552, 565-66 (2011) (\u201cLawmakers may no \nmore silence unwanted speech by burdening its \nutterance than by censoring its content.\u201d). \nd.  Finally, the Fifth Circuit suggested it was \nimpelled towards applying rational-basis review for \nfear that states otherwise would lack means of \nprotecting children from harmful sexual content.  Pet. \nApp. 22a-23a.  But in applying strict scrutiny in Sable, \nPlayboy, Reno, and Ashcroft, the Court noted less \n \nsimply that the Indiana and Texas statutes should be treated the \nsame (i.e., not subject to an injunction) pending the Court\u2019s \ndecision in this case.  Free Speech Coal., Inc. v. Rokita, 2024 WL \n3861733, at *1-2 (7th Cir. Aug. 16, 2024) (Rovner, J., concurring in \npart, dissenting in part). \n\n33 \n \n \nrestrictive options each time.  Strict scrutiny is not \u201ca \ndeath knell in and of itself.\u201d  Pet. App. 22a.  The Court \nhas upheld laws under strict First Amendment scrutiny.  \nSee, e.g., Williams-Yulee v. Fla. Bar, 575 U.S. 433, 444, \n457 (2015); Holder v. Humanitarian Law Project, 561 \nU.S. 1, 39 (2010); cf. Citizens United v. FEC, 558 U.S. \n310, 366-67, 371-72 (2010) (upholding disclaimer and \ndisclosure provisions of campaign-finance law because \nthey survived \u201cexacting scrutiny\u201d).  The Court in \nAshcroft expressly stated that a narrowly tailored \n\u201cregulation of the Internet designed to prevent minors \nfrom gaining access to harmful materials\u201d would pass \nmuster, and pointed to less restrictive options.  542 U.S. \nat 666-70, 672.  And the district court in this case \nlikewise acknowledged that there \u201care viable and \nconstitutional means to achieve Texas\u2019s goal\u201d of \nprotecting minors from sexual content online without \nunduly limiting adults\u2019 rights.  Pet. App. 160a.  Adhering \nto strict scrutiny, in sum, would not render states \npowerless to protect minors.  It would merely require \nthem to do so through a carefully tailored law. \nAccepting the Fifth Circuit\u2019s position, by contrast, \ncould invite even more troubling restrictions on speech, \nreaching beyond petitioners\u2019 websites to include \n\u201cbookstores, \nlibraries, \npublishers, \nauthors \nand[] \nmainstream websites,\u201d among others.  Am. Booksellers \nCert. Amicus Br. 1.  After all, if a state seeking to \nprotect minors from harmful sexual content needs only \na rational basis to restrict adults\u2019 access to protected \nspeech, states might attempt to ban the publication of \nsexual content more generally\u2014a seemingly rational \nmechanism to shield minors from sexual content that \ncould harm them.  But see Butler, 352 U.S. at 383-84.  \nNor would the implications of affirmance necessarily be \nlimited to sexual content in the eyes of lower courts.  \n\n34 \n \n \nSeveral states have recently enacted laws requiring \nsocial-media websites to perform age verification \nbefore allowing access to their platforms.  See, e.g., Ark. \nCode \u00a7 4-88-1402; Ga. Code \u00a7\u00a7 39-6-2, 3 (effective July \n1, 2025).  Other states have pursued content-based \nrestrictions on library books or instructional materials \nunder the auspices of protecting minors from \npurportedly harmful speech more broadly.  See, e.g., \nIowa Code \u00a7 256.11; Tenn. Code \u00a7 49-6-1019.  Even if \nthe Fifth Circuit\u2019s reasoning would not apply directly to \nsuch laws, any suggestion that they could be subject to \nmere rational-basis review would lead down a troubling \nroad.  Cf. Stern v. Marshall, 564 U.S. 462, 503 (2011) \n(\u201cSlight encroachments create new boundaries from \nwhich legions of power can seek new territory to \ncapture.\u201d (citation omitted)). \n4. H.B. 1181\u2019s Age-Verification Provision Is \nAlso Subject To Strict Scrutiny Because It \nEmbodies Speaker-Based Discrimination \nH.B. 1181 is subject to struct scrutiny on a separate \nground: it discriminates against particular speakers in \nways that suggest the state\u2019s disapproval of the content \nof their speech.    \na.  \u201cLaws designed or intended to suppress or \nrestrict the expression of specific speakers contradict \nbasic First Amendment principles.\u201d  Playboy, 529 U.S. \nat 812.  Such \u201c[s]peaker-based laws run the risk that \n\u2018the State has left unburdened those speakers whose \nmessages are in accord with its own views.\u2019\u201d  NIFLA, \n585 U.S. at 778 (citation omitted).  Unless the \nchallenged law can survive strict scrutiny, the First \nAmendment \u201cdoes not permit [the government] to \nimpose special prohibitions on those speakers who \n\n35 \n \n \nexpress views on disfavored subjects.\u201d  R.A.V. v. St. \nPaul, 505 U.S. 377, 391 (1992). \nH.B. 1181 squarely implicates those concerns.  It \ndiscriminates based on speaker by targeting the online \npornography industry while leaving unregulated \nidentical sexual content on social-media websites, on \nsearch engines, and on websites that limit their sexual \ncontent to no more than one-third of their total content, \nTex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code \u00a7\u00a7 129B.002, 005.  In \nsubstance, the legislature has singled out the \npornography industry while allowing those outside the \nindustry to purvey the same content without any such \nrestrictions.  See Rokita, 2024 WL 3228197, at *16 \n(explaining that materially identical Indiana law \n\u201cdiscriminates amongst speakers in the marketplace\u201d). \nFar from disguising its true design, Texas \npractically trumpets its censorial intent.  See Br. in Opp. \n1, 4 (boasting of success in limiting the speech of \u201cthe \npornography industry\u201d and describing petitioners\u2019 \nprotected speech as \u201cinexhaustible amounts of [] smut\u201d); \nResp. C.A. Br. 1, 23 (describing H.B. 1181\u2019s target as \n\u201ccommercial purveyors of online pornography\u201d and \ncastigating petitioners as \u201cBig Porn\u201d).  The law\u2019s \nimposition of compelled \u201chealth warnings\u201d make this \nconclusion inescapable, branding, as they do, all \npetitioners\u2019 adult patrons as unwell and needing \npsychiatric treatment.  See  Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code \n\u00a7 129B.004 (capitalization altered); p. 8, supra. \nb.  In concluding otherwise, the panel majority \nstated that H.B. 1181\u2019s exemptions of search engines \nand social media were driven by \u201ca reasonable policy \nchoice \nto \navoid \nthe \nlegal \nconcerns \nthat \naccompany \u2026 regulat[ing] the \u2018entire universe of \ncyberspace.\u2019\u201d  Pet. App. 25a (citing Reno, 521 U.S. at \n\n36 \n \n \n868).  But Texas has shown no compunction about \nregulating the entities that it left out of this law.  See \nNetChoice, 144 S. Ct. at 2408.  More fundamentally, \nexempting social-media websites and search engines \ncannot explain speaker-based discrimination where, as \nhere, it defeats the law\u2019s avowed purpose.  As the \ndistrict court found, H.B. 1181\u2019s exemptions allow \nminors to access, without any restrictions, endless \nvolumes of the same kinds of content that appear on \npetitioners\u2019 sites.  Pet. App. 113a-114a.  Indeed, \n\u201c[Texas\u2019s] own expert suggests that exposure to online \npornography often begins with \u2018misspelled searches,\u2019\u201d \nPet. App. 112a, and \u201c[Texas\u2019s] own study \u2026 points \nout[ that] pop-up ads, not pornographic websites, are \nthe most common forms of sexual material encountered \nby adolescents,\u201d  Pet. App. 131a.  Such \u201cdifferential \ntreatment, \nunless \njustified \nby \nsome \nspecial \ncharacteristic of the\u201d online pornography industry\u2014\nwhich the state has not identified\u2014\u201csuggests that the \ngoal of the regulation is not unrelated to suppression of \nexpression.\u201d  Minneapolis Star & Tribune Co. v. Minn. \nComm\u2019r of Revenue, 460 U.S. 575, 585 (1983). \nThe Fifth Circuit also misread R.A.V., reasoning \nthat the speaker-based \u201c[s]electivity\u201d prohibited by \nthat decision applied to \u201cdifferent sorts of messages, not \ndifferent mediums.\u201d  Pet. App. 25a (citation omitted).  \nBut R.A.V. never cabined its holding in that way, nor did \nit suggest that different rules would govern a speaker-\nbased restriction on another medium.  See 505 U.S. at \n394.  Indeed, this Court has held that an \u201cink and paper \ntax\u201d that \u201csingles out the press\u201d cannot stand for that \nvery reason.  Minneapolis Star, 460 U.S. at 591-92; see \nSmith v. Daily Mail Publ\u2019g Co., 443 U.S. 97, 105-06 \n(1979) (invalidating state law that restricted speech in \nnewspapers but not on radio).  In any event, the search \n\n37 \n \n \nengines and social-media platforms that H.B. 1181 \nexempts are part of the same medium\u2014the Internet\u2014\nas the websites H.B. 1181 targets.  Such a divergent \napproach to regulating the same medium further \nevinces \nspeaker-based \ndiscrimination, \nwhich \nindependently warrants strict scrutiny. \nB. Petitioners Are Likely To Succeed On The \nMerits Of Their Challenge To The Age-\nVerification Requirement In H.B. 1181 \nWhen H.B. 1181\u2019s age-verification provision is \nproperly subjected to strict scrutiny, petitioners satisfy \nthe principal requirement for a preliminary injunction \nbecause  \u201cthey are likely to succeed on the merits.\u201d  \nAshcroft, 542 U.S. at 666.   \n1. To survive strict scrutiny, H.B. 1181 must be \n\u201cnarrowly \ntailored \nto \npromote \na \ncompelling \n[g]overnment interest\u201d and employ the least speech-\nrestrictive means of protecting minors.  Playboy, 529 \nU.S. at 813; see Ashcroft, 542 U.S. at 665-66.  As the \ndistrict court\u2019s undisturbed factual findings make clear, \nTexas cannot come close to satisfying that test.  \nParticularly given this Court\u2019s instruction to \u201cuphold \nthe injunction\u201d if \u201cthe underlying constitutional \nquestion is close,\u201d id. at 664, Texas has no viable path to \nmeeting its heavy burden at this preliminary stage.  \nIndeed, this is if anything an a fortiori case from \nAshcroft, because H.B. 1181 materially replicates \nCOPA while applying to an even wider swath of speech, \nincluding fewer privacy and security protections, and \nexempting channels through which minors can continue \nto access the same sexual content.   \na.  To start, H.B. 1181 is \u201cvastly overinclusive\u201d by \ndesign, restricting through its very structure far more \n\n38 \n \n \nspeech than necessary to accomplish its purported aim.  \nBrown, 564 U.S. at 804.  Because the Act\u2019s requirements \napply to an entire website when any more than one-\nthird of the website\u2019s content falls within the statutory \ndefinition of sexual material harmful to minors, the Act \nburdens substantial amounts of speech that do not \nrelate to its stated purpose.  For example, a website that \ncontains 65% core political speech and 35% sexually \nsuggestive content would be 100% subject to H.B. \n1181\u2019s restrictions.  That is paradigmatic overinclusivity.  \nAs the district court aptly described, H.B. 1181 is akin \nto a restriction on movie theaters requiring them to \n\u201ccatalog all movies that they show, and if at least one-\nthird of those movies are R-rated, \u2026 screen everyone \nat the main entrance for their 18+ identification, \nregardless of what movie they wanted to see.\u201d  Pet. App. \n111a n.5.   \nb.  At the same time, H.B. 1181 is \u201cwildly \nunderinclusive when judged against its asserted \njustification,\u201d which \u201cis alone enough to defeat it.\u201d  \nBrown, 564 U.S. at 802.  Search engines are explicitly \nexempted from the Act\u2019s age-verification requirement, \neven though a minor can conduct an image or video \nsearch to yield \u201csexually explicit or pornographic\u201d \nresults \u201cextracted from [adult] websites regardless of \nage verification.\u201d  Pet. App. 112a.  Likewise, social-\nmedia \nplatforms \nlike \nReddit \n\u201cmaintain \nentire \ncommunities and forums\u201d devoted \u201cto posting online \npornography.\u201d  Pet. App. 113a.  Instagram and \nFacebook similarly contain \u201cmaterial which is sexually \nexplicit for minors.\u201d  Pet. App. 113a.  And a website \ncontaining massive amounts of sexual material obscene \nas to minors can remain unregulated just by adding \ntwice as much non-sexual material.  All of these \nloopholes allow minors to access the very material \n\n39 \n \n \nTexas purportedly wants to protect them from\u2014indeed, \nthe \u201cmaterial most likely to serve as a gateway to \npornography use.\u201d  Pet. App. 114a.  \nSuch significant gaps are \u201cnot how one addresses a \nserious social problem,\u201d and they render H.B. 1181 no \nless underinclusive than other laws that this Court has \ninvalidated under the First Amendment.  Brown, 564 \nU.S. at 802; see, e.g., id. at 805 (striking down a statute \nbarring the sale of violent video games to minors \nbecause it excluded other portrayals of similar violence); \nDenver Area, 518 U.S. at 753, 757, 760 (striking down a \nban on sexual content \u201con leased channels\u201d but \u201cnot on \nother channels\u201d because such content was \u201cbroadcast \nover both kinds of channels\u201d and \u201cthe record before \nCongress \u2026 provides no convincing explanation\u201d for \ndifferential treatment); Daily Mail, 443 U.S. at 104-05 \n(striking \ndown \nlaw \nthat \nprohibited \nnewspaper \npublication \nof \nyouthful \noffenders\u2019 \nnames \nwhile \npermitting publication by \u201celectronic media\u201d).  \nc.  Finally, like the federal government in Ashcroft \nand Reno, Texas fails to show that H.B. 1181 employs \nthe least restrictive means of pursuing its compelling \nend.  Ashcroft, 542 U.S. at 666 (citing Reno, 521 U.S. at \n874).  The district court\u2019s factual findings make clear \nthat less restrictive and more effective alternatives are \nreadily available, chief among them the modern variant \nof the content-filtering software that this Court \nrecognized as a less restrictive alternative to the age-\nverification regime in Ashcroft.  Id. at 666-73; see Pet. \nApp. 133a-135a.  Content-filtering software is installed \n\u201cat the receiving end\u201d\u2014e.g., on individual devices such \nas laptops or smart phones\u2014and prevents those devices \nfrom displaying material from selected websites or \napplications.  Ashcroft, 542 U.S. at 667; see Pet. App. \n\n40 \n \n \n132a, 134a; J.A. 59.  Such software is commonly used by \nemployers and other institutions (likely including \nfederal courts) to limit access to websites deemed \ninappropriate.  See J.A. 280. \nAs explained in Ashcroft, content-filtering software \nis less restrictive of speech than \u201cuniversal restrictions \nat the source\u201d such as mandatory age-verification \nbecause it can restrict minors\u2019 access to inappropriate \ncontent while preserving adults\u2019 \u201caccess to speech they \nhave a right to see without having to identify \nthemselves or provide\u201d sensitive personal information.  \n542 U.S. at 667.  Likewise, content-filtering software \nempowers parents to control the kinds of material their \nchildren are able to view, which by definition provides \nbetter tailoring than a blunt governmental mandate.  Id. \nat 667-68; cf. Mahanoy Area Sch. Dist. v. B.L., 594 U.S. \n180, 201-02 (2021) (Alito, J., concurring) (\u201c[P]arents, not \nthe State, have the primary authority and duty to raise, \neducate, and form the character of their children.\u201d); \nPlayboy, 529 U.S. at 824-25 (emphasizing the goal of \nproviding options for parents in restricting minors\u2019 \naccess to sexual content).  And content-filtering \nsoftware is more effective than age verification, which \nis notoriously \u201csubject to evasion and circumvention\u201d\u2014\nand which can drive minors to dangerous parts of the \ndark web that content filters would block.  Ashcroft, 542 \nU.S. at 667-68; see Int\u2019l Centre for Missing and \nExploited Children (ICMEC) Cert. Amicus Br. 3, 14-16.   \nAs the district court found, all those reasons to \nprefer filtering software ring even truer today.  While \n\u201c[t]he risks of compelled digital verification are just as \nlarge, if not greater\u201d than in 2004, filtering software has \nonly improved and \u201ccan more precisely screen out \nsexual content for minors without limiting access to \n\n41 \n \n \nother speech.\u201d  Pet. App. 127a, 132a.  Moreover, minors \nhave only grown savvier with technology, such as \nVirtual Private Networks (VPNs), that bypass online \nage verification with ease.  Pet. App. 134a; see ICMEC \nCert. Amicus Br. 10-13.  Yet despite this Court\u2019s \ninstruction in Ashcroft that governments \u201cundoubtedly \nmay act to encourage the use of filters\u201d or \u201ctake steps \nto promote their development by industry,\u201d 542 U.S. at \n669, Texas has taken no such steps\u2014or even, as far as \nthe legislative record reflects, considered such less \nrestrictive \nalternatives, \nsee \nPet. \nApp. \n85a \n(Higginbotham, J., dissenting); Pet. App. 135a-136a.6 \n2.  Texas has suggested that, even if H.B. 1181 fails \nstrict scrutiny, it is nevertheless immune from facial \ninvalidation because it permissibly applies to obscene \nspeech that is constitutionally unprotected for adults.  \nBr. in Opp. 22; see NetChoice, LLC, 144 S. Ct. at 2397 \n(explaining that a First Amendment facial challenge \nrequires showing that \u201ca substantial number of [the \nlaw\u2019s] applications are unconstitutional, judged in \nrelation to the statute\u2019s plainly legitimate sweep\u201d \n(citation omitted)).  But as explained above\u2014and as the \nstate conceded in the Fifth Circuit\u2014Texas separately \ncriminalizes obscenity for adults, so the whole point of \n \n6  It would also be less restrictive to pair preinstalled filtering \ntechnology on devices with device-level age-verification measures, \nmeaning that the device would block sexually explicit content by \ndefault until an adult user verifies his or her age on the device.  \nPet. App. 128a; see ICMEC Cert. Amicus Br. 17-19.  Alternatively, \nInternet service providers could by default block sexually explicit \ncontent until adults opt out of the blocking regime.  Pet. App. 128a; \ncf. Playboy, 529 U.S. at 823 (noting that a \u201cwell-promoted \nvoluntary blocking provision\u201d could be a less restrictive means of \npreventing minors\u2019 access to sexual content); Denver Area, 518 \nU.S. at 759 (similar). \n\n42 \n \n \nH.B. 1181 is to impose age verification and other \nburdens on sexual material that is obscene for minors \nbut not for adults.  See pp. 25-26, supra.  H.B. 1181 is \nthus no more immune to a facial challenge than the \nsimilarly structured laws in Reno and Ashcroft, both of \nwhich were challenged facially and subject to \npreliminary injunctions that this Court affirmed.  See \nReno, 521 U.S. at 883, 885; Ashcroft, 542 U.S. at 664, \n672. \nNor is H.B. 1181 susceptible to the analysis that led \nthe Court in NetChoice to question the facial challenges \nat issue.  There, the Court remanded for the lower \ncourts to \u201cask[], as to every covered platform or \nfunction, whether there is an intrusion on protected \neditorial discretion.\u201d  144 S. Ct. at 2398.  The Court \nadded that \u201cit is not hard to see how the answers might \ndiffer\u201d depending on the nature of the platform.  Id.  No \nsuch reasoning applies here, because there are no \ndistinctions among covered websites that entitle some \nto greater constitutional protection than others.  \u201cIt is \nthe structure of the law, and not its application to any \nparticular [website], that renders it unconstitutional.\u201d  \nPet. App. 122a n.10; see Ams. for Prosperity Found. v. \nBonta, 594 U.S. 595, 618 (2021) (similarly finding that a \nlaw that exhibits categorically improper tailoring is \nfacially invalid under the First Amendment).  If \nanything, Texas\u2019s defense of H.B. 1181 focuses on its \napplication to these challengers, which comprise the \ntargeted industry; upon advancing to other applications, \nTexas\u2019s defense becomes that much weaker and the \nlikely unconstitutionality that much clearer.  In other \nwords, the basis for facial unconstitutionality follows a \nfortiori from the success of an as-applied challenge here.  \nSee Order Den. Mot. for Stay Pending Appeal at 4-13, \nFree Speech Coal. v. Rokita, No. 1:24-cv-00980-RLY-\n\n43 \n \n \nMG (S.D. Ind. July 25, 2024), ECF No. 50 (rejecting a \nsimilar NetChoice-based facial challenge argument).   \nC. Petitioners \nSatisfy \nThe \nRemaining \nPreliminary Injunction Factors \nBeyond likelihood of success on the merits, \npetitioners satisfy the other requirements for a \npreliminary injunction.  They are \u201clikely to suffer \nirreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief \u201d \nand \u201cthe balance of equities\u201d and \u201cthe public interest\u201d \nweigh heavily in their favor.  Winter, 555 U.S. at 20. \n\u201cThe loss of First Amendment freedoms, for even \nminimal periods of time, unquestionably constitutes \nirreparable injury.\u201d  Elrod v. Burns, 427 U.S. 347, 373 \n(1976).  With Texas actively filing enforcement actions \nunder H.B. 1181\u2019s age-verification provision, the chill \ninflicted on petitioners\u2019 protected speech is ongoing and \npalpable\u2014thus supplying a paradigmatic basis for a \npreliminary injunction. \nPetitioners also face the additional irreparable harm \nof bearing the unrecoverable costs of complying with an \nunconstitutional law.  Indeed, \u201ccomplying with a \nregulation later held invalid almost always produces \nthe irreparable harm of nonrecoverable compliance \ncosts.\u201d  Thunder Basin Coal Co. v. Reich, 510 U.S. 200, \n220-21 (1994) (Scalia, J., concurring).  Given Texas\u2019s \nsovereign immunity from claims for money damages, \nsee Pet. App. 157a, petitioners face mounting financial \nburdens of complying with the law (either by \nimplementing costly measures or by abandoning \noperations) if the preliminary injunction is not restored. \nAs for the equities, they merge with the public \ninterest, see Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 435 (2009), \nand strongly favor petitioners.  States have no interest \n\n44 \n \n \nin enforcing unconstitutional laws, particularly laws \nthat are as ineffective and ill-suited to their avowed \npurpose as H.B. 1181 is.  See Gordon v. Holder, 721 F.3d \n638, 653 (D.C. Cir. 2013) (\u201c[E]nforcement of an \nunconstitutional law is always contrary to the public \ninterest.\u201d).  \nFinally, as in Ashcroft, restoring the preliminary \ninjunction will not end this case.  See 542 U.S. at 672-73. \nTo the extent a factual dispute remains as to H.B. 1181\u2019s \ntailoring and the least restrictive means, both sides may \nbenefit from a more fulsome factual record.  See Pet. \nApp. 85a (Higginbotham, J., dissenting).  In this respect, \ntoo, proper resolution of this case follows from Reno and \nAshcroft, which affirmed preliminary injunctions of like \nlaws while \u201callow[ing] the parties to update and \nsupplement the factual record to reflect current \ntechnological realities.\u201d  Ashcroft, 542 U.S. at 672. \nCONCLUSION \nThe judgment of the court of appeals should be \nreversed.   \n \n \n\n45 \n \n \nRespectfully submitted. \nDAVID D.

          "task_beliefs": "My second attempt to locate the petitioners' expert technical rebuttal, this time by searching for a brief from the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), has also failed. The search returned the Yoti amicus brief, which I have already analyzed. This repeated null result is highly informative, leading to a significant evolution in my understanding of the case dynamics.\n\n1.  **Central Legal Conflict (Stable):** The fundamental choice for the Court remains between the rational basis standard from *Ginsberg v. New York* and the strict scrutiny standard from *Ashcroft v. ACLU (Ashcroft II)*. This observation does not alter the legal framework.\n\n2.  **Respondent's Path to Victory (Strengthened):** The technological argument presented in the Yoti amicus brief now appears even more dominant. Having failed in two separate, targeted searches (for EFF and ACLU briefs) to find a direct technical counter-argument, the probability that no such direct rebuttal exists has increased. This suggests the respondent (Texas) may have an uncontested claim that modern, privacy-preserving age verification is a technologically feasible, effective, and least restrictive means. The \"bartender\" analogy and the argument that \"the technology has changed\" since *Ashcroft II* remain potent and, so far, unanswered.\n\n3.  **Petitioners' Position (Hypothesis Refined):** My previous belief that the petitioners' success *hinges* on an expert-led refutation of the technology is now being revised. The repeated failure to find such a refutation suggests an alternative and equally plausible strategy: the petitioners may be sidestepping the technological debate entirely. Their argument could be a purely legal one: that *any* mandatory age-verification system, regardless of its technological sophistication or privacy protections, imposes an unconstitutional burden on anonymous speech and fails strict scrutiny as a matter of principle. This would frame the issue not as a \"battle of experts\" on technology, but as a bright-line defense of the right to access lawful speech without showing identification.\n\n4.  **Prediction Model (Confidence Shift):** My provisional lean towards Texas has slightly increased. If the petitioners are indeed ceding the entire technological battlefield, they are allowing the respondent to frame the \"least restrictive means\" test on their own terms. The Court might be more inclined to accept the respondent's solution if the petitioners offer no alternative or critique of its feasibility. However, my overall confidence remains low because I have not yet confirmed the petitioners' actual line of argument. The case could still easily go the other way if their purely legal argument is persuasive enough to make the technology irrelevant.\n\n5.  **Next Area of Uncertainty (Action Plan Corrected):** The most critical uncertainty is no longer just finding a *technical rebuttal*. It is now more fundamental: **What is the petitioners' primary argument against H.B. 1181?** My focus on amicus briefs was premature. The single most important document to analyze next is the **Petitioners' own brief on the merits**. This will reveal their core strategy and confirm whether they are engaging with the technology or arguing that it is constitutionally irrelevant.",
          "design_beliefs": "This second failed search provides a powerful lesson in research strategy and the interpretation of negative evidence, leading to a crucial refinement of my design-level heuristics.\n\n1.  **Adopt a Dialectical Approach (Validated):** This heuristic remains essential. The repeated failure to find the expected \"antithesis\" (a technical rebuttal) is a strong signal that my initial model of the dialectic (Tech vs. Anti-Tech) may be wrong. The true conflict might be (Tech as a solution vs. Tech as irrelevant to the constitutional principle).\n\n2.  **Prioritize Foundational Documents (CRITICAL REFINEMENT):** This observation reveals a flaw in my previous sequencing. I pursued specialized amicus briefs before confirming the core arguments of the primary parties. This led me to hunt for evidence supporting an assumed strategy that may not exist. **NEW HEURISTIC: Always analyze the merits briefs of the petitioner and respondent *before* seeking out supporting or specialized amicus briefs.** This establishes the foundational arguments and prevents wasted effort chasing phantom counter-arguments.\n\n3.  **Analyze Amicus Briefs (Refined):** The value of amicus briefs, especially expert ones like Yoti's, is high. However, their role is to supplement or bolster a primary argument. Their analysis must follow, not precede, an understanding of the main briefs.\n\n4.  **Strategic Sequencing of Information Gathering (Refined):** My information-gathering sequence has been corrected. The optimal order is: (1) Foundational party briefs (Petition for Certiorari, Briefs on the Merits for Petitioner and Respondent) to understand the core claims, then (2) Specialized amicus briefs that address key technical or complex points (like technology), and finally (3) General amicus briefs to gauge the breadth of support.\n\n5.  **Pivot from Broad to Targeted Search (Refined):** My sub-heuristic to \"Debug and Iterate on Targeted Searches\" is now more sophisticated. The process is not just to try new keywords (e.g., EFF -> ACLU). **NEW SUB-HEURISTIC \u2014 Question the Premise:** When multiple, logically-related targeted searches for a specific *type* of evidence fail, the next step is to question the underlying assumption that such evidence exists. The failure itself becomes data about the party's strategy.\n\n6.  **Isolate Commercially Interested Amici (Stable):** This remains a valuable principle. The Yoti brief provides a clear, commercially-motivated argument for the technology's viability. The absence of a counter-argument from a mission-driven civil liberties group is now the key insight.\n\n7.  **The \"Technology Changed\" Argument (Refined):** My understanding of this argument's structure is now more nuanced. I was searching for the counter-argument that \"the technology is still bad.\" I must now actively search for the alternative counter-argument: \"the technology's quality is irrelevant because any such requirement is an unconstitutional burden.\"\n\n8.  **The Power of Framing and Analogy (Stable):** The respondent's \"bartender\" analogy remains a powerful, unanswered frame. My next step\u2014reading the petitioner's main brief\u2014is a direct attempt to find their counter-frame.\n\n9.  **The Value of Meta-Cognitive Actions (`THINK`) (Validated):** The `THINK` process correctly identifies key uncertainties and plans actions. This observation, resulting from a failed action, provides the critical feedback needed to correct a flawed assumption in the next planning cycle, demonstrating the iterative and self-correcting nature of the DBOED process."
