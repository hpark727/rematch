      "Can a nonparty challenge a federal agency\u2019s \u201cfinal order\u201d under the Hobbs Act\u2019s judicial review provision?",

    "facts_of_the_case": "The United States has grappled with nuclear waste storage since the 1940s, initially from weapons development and later from commercial nuclear power. While spent nuclear fuel was originally intended to be reprocessed, this proved impractical, leading Congress to pass the Nuclear Waste Policy Act in 1982. The Act designated Yucca Mountain in Nevada as the nation\u2019s permanent underground repository and required the Department of Energy to begin accepting waste from states by 1998. However, amid strong opposition and delays, the Obama administration halted work on Yucca Mountain and established a Blue Ribbon Commission, which recommended a consent-based approach to siting storage facilities.\n\nFollowing that shift in policy, Waste Control Specialists (as Interim Storage Partners) applied to build a nuclear waste storage facility in Andrews County, Texas. Despite opposition from Texas's governor and legislature, which passed a law prohibiting such storage, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission issued a license in September 2021. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit vacated the license, holding that neither the Atomic Energy Act nor the Nuclear Waste Policy Act authorized the Commission to license private interim storage facilities.",

Its contribution to understanding the case outcome (\u03b8) is minimal and indirect, stemming only from organizing the existing problem description into a coherent plan. The real Task EIG will come from the *next* action this plan sets up.\n\nDesign EIG (0.4): The action has moderate value for improving design beliefs (D). The agent explicitly articulates a generalizable prediction heuristic: 'The Solicitor General's arguments are often highly influential with the Court.' This moves the agent's design belief from a null state to identifying a key factor in SCOTUS prediction. Formulating this strategy is a direct, albeit small, update to the agent's model of effective prediction methods.\n\nJoint EIG (0.5): The overall value lies in its strategic function. It's a necessary, well-reasoned step that identifies a high-leverage subsequent action (reading the petitioner's brief), and in doing so, it refines the agent's general approach to the prediction task.",

Similarly, the design beliefs are at a basic heuristic level, acknowledging multiple possible factors but without prior knowledge or strategic refinement, so design complexity is low (0.2). The beliefs are internally consistent and well integrated, as the agent explicitly recognizes its lack of knowledge and plans to acquire it, resulting in high coherence (0.8). However, the beliefs are sparse and minimal in detail, reflecting low information density (0.1). Confidence is high because the evaluation is straightforward given the explicit statements of the agent's current beliefs.",

Reading the petitioner's brief on the merits will provide a comprehensive, high-quality overview of the legal arguments for one side, directly addressing both legal questions. This will allow me to move from a state of no information about the arguments to a deep understanding of the petitioner's case, including their interpretation of the Hobbs Act, Atomic Energy Act, and Nuclear Waste Policy Act. This is a massive reduction in task-specific uncertainty, second only to reading both parties' briefs.\n\nDesign EIG (0.8): My current design belief is that starting with the petitioner's brief is a highly effective strategy. This action directly tests and is expected to strongly confirm that hypothesis. Observing how the Solicitor General (a highly respected litigant) frames the case will provide a concrete, generalizable model for analyzing future administrative law cases. The high expected information gain will validate this as a foundational step in my predictive methodology, significantly improving my overall design.\n\nJoint EIG (1.7): The action provides immense value on both axes.

No. 97-425, 96 Stat. 2201 \n(codified as amended at 42 U.S.C. 10101 et seq.) are set \nforth at ISP Pet. App. 109a-200a. \nINTRODUCTION \n At the dawn of the atomic age, the use, owner-\nship, and control of nuclear materials and technology \nin this country was strictly a government monopoly.  \nThat changed, however, with the Atomic Energy Act of \n1954, Pub. L. No. 83-703, 68 Stat. 919 (codified as \namended at 42 U.S.C. 2011 et seq.) (\u201cAEA\u201d).  The AEA \nreflects \u201cCongress\u2019 determination that the national in-\nterest would be best served if the Government encour-\naged the private sector to become involved in the \n\n2 \ndevelopment of atomic energy for peaceful purposes \nunder a program of federal regulation and licensing.\u201d  \nPac. Gas & Elec. Co. v. State Energy Res. Conservation \n& Dev. Comm\u2019n, 461 U.S. 190, 207 (1983).   \nCongress pursued those goals through a newly \ncreated agency, the Atomic Energy Commission, which \nwas tasked with developing the rules, regulations, and \nstandards that would govern the still-new, world-al-\ntering technology of atomic fission.  The degree of re-\nsponsibility assigned to the agency in the AEA was \n\u201cvirtually unique.\u201d  Siegel v. Atomic Energy Comm\u2019n, \n400 F.2d 778, 783 (D.C. Cir. 1968).  A brand-new in-\ndustry was born\u2014one that eventually grew to become \na major component of the nation\u2019s energy and econ-\nomy, now supplying about one fifth of all electricity \nconsumed in the United States.  It is carbon-free and \ndependable baseload power.  Today, new technologies \npresent exciting opportunities to address critical na-\ntional needs for the future.  E.g., Advanced Nuclear - \nPathways to Commercial Liftoff, U.S. DEP\u2019T OF EN-\nERGY, https://liftoff.energy.gov/advanced-nuclear-2/ \n(last visited Nov. 11, 2024). \nThe development of the nuclear energy industry \nin this country, however, has not been linear.  There \nhave been advances and setbacks, as well as periodic \npolitical, and economic, challenges.  And, there has \nbeen the issue of how to deal with spent nuclear fuel.  \nThe Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 (\u201cNWPA\u201d) \ncharged the Department of Energy with accepting and \npermanently disposing of spent nuclear fuel, starting \nin 1998.  But, as everyone now knows, that did not oc-\ncur, and the Yucca Mountain project remains stalled.  \nUtilities are therefore forced to deal with spent nuclear \n\n3 \nfuel storage issues on a larger scale than anyone would \nhave liked or anticipated. \nThis case grew out of that challenge.  Petitioner \nInterim Storage Partners, LLC seeks to construct an \ninstallation for the temporary storage of spent nuclear \nfuel, adjacent to an existing facility in west Texas li-\ncensed for disposal of low-level radioactive waste.  The \nproject has the potential to alleviate pressures on the \ndomestic nuclear power industry, and to save hun-\ndreds of millions of dollars through efficiencies and \neconomies of scale.  One cannot, however, simply em-\nbark upon such a project alone.  Permission\u2014a \u201cli-\ncense\u201d\u2014is required from the Nuclear Regulatory Com-\nmission (\u201cNRC\u201d or \u201cCommission\u201d), which succeeded \nthe Atomic Energy Commission as the regulator of nu-\nclear safety.  Obtaining that license is a monumental \nundertaking.  There are reams of required environ-\nmental and safety analyses (including a 500-page draft \nand 700-page final environmental impact statement in \nthis case), public engagement, multiple scoping meet-\nings, requests for supplemental information, robust \nopportunities for review and opposition, and potential \nadjudication of contentions and issues, all pursuant to \nrules, regulations, and legal principles that have be-\ncome substantially settled since the industry grew \nfrom nothing half a century ago to what it is today. \nAnd all of that happened here\u2014ISP spent years, \nand millions of dollars, to secure its NRC license.  Mul-\ntiple environmental groups and other entities opposed \nthe project.  Agency administrative boards were con-\nvened and addressed the arguments raised, and the \nCommission heard and resolved multiple appeals.  The \nD.C. Circuit then heard the legal challenges, \n\n4 \neventually affirming the NRC issuance of the license \nto ISP.  The State of New Mexico, having eschewed the \nagency procedures for opposing the project, neverthe-\nless filed a petition for review in the Tenth Circuit, \nwhich the Tenth Circuit dismissed. \nThen, in response to petitions for review filed by \nthe State of Texas and Fasken, the Fifth Circuit went \noff the rails.  Unlike the Tenth Circuit (and every other \ncircuit court to address such issues), the court deter-\nmined to hear the case even though the requirements \nof the governing judicial review provision, the Hobbs \nAct, were not met by the petitioners (because they in-\ntentionally declined to avail themselves of the well-\nknown agency processes).  To do so, the Fifth Circuit \nresurrected its seemingly dormant judge-made \u201cultra \nvires exception,\u201d whereby a mere allegation that an \nagency exceeded its legal authority automatically en-\ntitles a litigant to judicial review, even if that litigant \nis not authorized to sue by the review statute.  And, on \nthe merits, the Fifth Circuit held that the NRC had no \nauthority under the AEA to do what it had been doing \nfor many decades (i.e., license temporary away-from-\nreactor storage of spent nuclear fuel), and that the \nNWPA did not permit the issuance of the license.  In \nso holding, the Fifth Circuit misapplied basic princi-\nples of statutory interpretation, ignored regulations \nexpressly contemplating such projects that have been \non the books since 1980, and broke with every other \ncircuit that has addressed the issue. \nThe repercussions of the Fifth Circuit\u2019s errors are \ndestabilizing, and potentially devastating, to a critical \nindustry at a critical time.  Respectfully, this Court \nshould reverse. \n\n5 \nSTATEMENT \nI.\nLegal framework.  \n1.\nLess than ten years after Hiroshima, Congress \npassed the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, Pub. L. No. 83-\n703, 68 Stat. 919 (codified as amended at 42 U.S.C. \n2011 et seq.) (\u201cAEA\u201d), to further peaceful uses of atomic \nenergy.  The purposes of the AEA included \u201cdevelop-\nment, use, and control of atomic energy * * * so as to \nmake the maximum contribution to the general wel-\nfare,\u201d 42 U.S.C. 2011(a), and to \u201cimprove the general \nwelfare, increase the standard of living, and \nstrengthen free competition in private enterprise.\u201d  42 \nU.S.C. 2011(b).  Congress found that the development, \nutilization, and control of atomic energy was \u201cvital to \nthe common defense and security.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 2012(a).  \nA central purpose of the AEA was to maximize peace-\nful development and utilization of atomic energy.  42 \nU.S.C. 2013(d).  See, e.g., Pac. Gas & Elec. Co. v. State \nEnergy Res. Conservation & Dev. Comm\u2019n, 461 U.S. \n190, 207 (1983) (AEA enacted to \u201cencourage[\u200a] the pri-\nvate sector\u201d to develop \u201catomic energy for peaceful pur-\nposes under a program of federal regulation and li-\ncensing\u201d). \nThe AEA created a new agency, the Atomic Energy \nCommission.  Among its chief tasks was to oversee the \npossession and use of nuclear materials.  Congress \nfound that \u201cthe processing and utilization of source, \nbyproduct, and special nuclear material affect inter-\nstate and foreign commerce and must be regulated in \nthe national interest,\u201d and that the \u201cprocessing and \nutilization of source, byproduct, and special nuclear \nmaterial must be regulated in the national interest \nand in order to provide for the common defense and \n\n6 \nsecurity and to protect the health and safety of the \npublic.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 2012(c), (d).  To that end, Congress \nbroadly tasked the AEA to \u201cestablish by rule, regula-\ntion, or order, such standards and instructions to gov-\nern the possession and use of special nuclear material, \nsource material, and byproduct material as the Com-\nmission may deem necessary or desirable to promote \nthe common defense and security or to protect health \nor to minimize danger to life or property.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \n2201(b). \nSpent nuclear fuel fits squarely within this ex-\npress delegation of authority.  It is composed of \u201cspe-\ncial nuclear material,\u201d such as enriched uranium and \nplutonium, \u201csource material,\u201d such as natural ura-\nnium, and \u201cbyproduct \n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n69: 20241202151101230_No.2023-13002023-131220Morgan20Lewis20Bockius20COC.json (score: 0.419)\nNos. 23-1300, 23-1912\n\nINTHE\n\nSupreme Court of the United States\n\nUNrTED StarEs NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION,\nED AL., PETITIONERS\n\nSTATE OF TEXAS, FT AL.\n\nINTERIM STORAGE PARTNERS, LLC, PETITIONER\n\u2018STATE OF TEXAS, ET AL.\n\nOn Writs Of Certiorari To The\nUnited States Court Of Appeals\nFor The Fifth Cireuit\n\nBRIEF FOR PETITIONER\nINTERIM STORAGE PARTNERS, LLC\n\nCERTIFICATE OF COMPLIANCE\n\nAs required by Supreme Court Rule 33.1(h), I certify that the document contains\n111,203 words, excluding the parts of the document that are exempted by Supreme Court,\nRule 93.104).\n\nI declare under penalty of perjury that the forogoing is true and correct.\n\nHER DORNER\nLIC\nDistrict of Columbia\n\n\u2018My commission expires April 30, 2029,\n\n",

No. 97-425, 96 Stat. 2201 \n(codified as amended at 42 U.S.C. 10101 et seq.) are set \nforth at ISP Pet. App. 109a-200a. \nINTRODUCTION \n At the dawn of the atomic age, the use, owner-\nship, and control of nuclear materials and technology \nin this country was strictly a government monopoly.  \nThat changed, however, with the Atomic Energy Act of \n1954, Pub. L. No. 83-703, 68 Stat. 919 (codified as \namended at 42 U.S.C. 2011 et seq.) (\u201cAEA\u201d).  The AEA \nreflects \u201cCongress\u2019 determination that the national in-\nterest would be best served if the Government encour-\naged the private sector to become involved in the \n\n2 \ndevelopment of atomic energy for peaceful purposes \nunder a program of federal regulation and licensing.\u201d  \nPac. Gas & Elec. Co. v. State Energy Res. Conservation \n& Dev. Comm\u2019n, 461 U.S. 190, 207 (1983).   \nCongress pursued those goals through a newly \ncreated agency, the Atomic Energy Commission, which \nwas tasked with developing the rules, regulations, and \nstandards that would govern the still-new, world-al-\ntering technology of atomic fission.  The degree of re-\nsponsibility assigned to the agency in the AEA was \n\u201cvirtually unique.\u201d  Siegel v. Atomic Energy Comm\u2019n, \n400 F.2d 778, 783 (D.C. Cir. 1968).  A brand-new in-\ndustry was born\u2014one that eventually grew to become \na major component of the nation\u2019s energy and econ-\nomy, now supplying about one fifth of all electricity \nconsumed in the United States.  It is carbon-free and \ndependable baseload power.  Today, new technologies \npresent exciting opportunities to address critical na-\ntional needs for the future.  E.g., Advanced Nuclear - \nPathways to Commercial Liftoff, U.S. DEP\u2019T OF EN-\nERGY, https://liftoff.energy.gov/advanced-nuclear-2/ \n(last visited Nov. 11, 2024). \nThe development of the nuclear energy industry \nin this country, however, has not been linear.  There \nhave been advances and setbacks, as well as periodic \npolitical, and economic, challenges.  And, there has \nbeen the issue of how to deal with spent nuclear fuel.  \nThe Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 (\u201cNWPA\u201d) \ncharged the Department of Energy with accepting and \npermanently disposing of spent nuclear fuel, starting \nin 1998.  But, as everyone now knows, that did not oc-\ncur, and the Yucca Mountain project remains stalled.  \nUtilities are therefore forced to deal with spent nuclear \n\n3 \nfuel storage issues on a larger scale than anyone would \nhave liked or anticipated. \nThis case grew out of that challenge.  Petitioner \nInterim Storage Partners, LLC seeks to construct an \ninstallation for the temporary storage of spent nuclear \nfuel, adjacent to an existing facility in west Texas li-\ncensed for disposal of low-level radioactive waste.  The \nproject has the potential to alleviate pressures on the \ndomestic nuclear power industry, and to save hun-\ndreds of millions of dollars through efficiencies and \neconomies of scale.  One cannot, however, simply em-\nbark upon such a project alone.  Permission\u2014a \u201cli-\ncense\u201d\u2014is required from the Nuclear Regulatory Com-\nmission (\u201cNRC\u201d or \u201cCommission\u201d), which succeeded \nthe Atomic Energy Commission as the regulator of nu-\nclear safety.  Obtaining that license is a monumental \nundertaking.  There are reams of required environ-\nmental and safety analyses (including a 500-page draft \nand 700-page final environmental impact statement in \nthis case), public engagement, multiple scoping meet-\nings, requests for supplemental information, robust \nopportunities for review and opposition, and potential \nadjudication of contentions and issues, all pursuant to \nrules, regulations, and legal principles that have be-\ncome substantially settled since the industry grew \nfrom nothing half a century ago to what it is today. \nAnd all of that happened here\u2014ISP spent years, \nand millions of dollars, to secure its NRC license.  Mul-\ntiple environmental groups and other entities opposed \nthe project.  Agency administrative boards were con-\nvened and addressed the arguments raised, and the \nCommission heard and resolved multiple appeals.  The \nD.C. Circuit then heard the legal challenges, \n\n4 \neventually affirming the NRC issuance of the license \nto ISP.  The State of New Mexico, having eschewed the \nagency procedures for opposing the project, neverthe-\nless filed a petition for review in the Tenth Circuit, \nwhich the Tenth Circuit dismissed. \nThen, in response to petitions for review filed by \nthe State of Texas and Fasken, the Fifth Circuit went \noff the rails.  Unlike the Tenth Circuit (and every other \ncircuit court to address such issues), the court deter-\nmined to hear the case even though the requirements \nof the governing judicial review provision, the Hobbs \nAct, were not met by the petitioners (because they in-\ntentionally declined to avail themselves of the well-\nknown agency processes).  To do so, the Fifth Circuit \nresurrected its seemingly dormant judge-made \u201cultra \nvires exception,\u201d whereby a mere allegation that an \nagency exceeded its legal authority automatically en-\ntitles a litigant to judicial review, even if that litigant \nis not authorized to sue by the review statute.  And, on \nthe merits, the Fifth Circuit held that the NRC had no \nauthority under the AEA to do what it had been doing \nfor many decades (i.e., license temporary away-from-\nreactor storage of spent nuclear fuel), and that the \nNWPA did not permit the issuance of the license.  In \nso holding, the Fifth Circuit misapplied basic princi-\nples of statutory interpretation, ignored regulations \nexpressly contemplating such projects that have been \non the books since 1980, and broke with every other \ncircuit that has addressed the issue. \nThe repercussions of the Fifth Circuit\u2019s errors are \ndestabilizing, and potentially devastating, to a critical \nindustry at a critical time.  Respectfully, this Court \nshould reverse. \n\n5 \nSTATEMENT \nI.\nLegal framework.  \n1.\nLess than ten years after Hiroshima, Congress \npassed the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, Pub. L. No. 83-\n703, 68 Stat. 919 (codified as amended at 42 U.S.C. \n2011 et seq.) (\u201cAEA\u201d), to further peaceful uses of atomic \nenergy.  The purposes of the AEA included \u201cdevelop-\nment, use, and control of atomic energy * * * so as to \nmake the maximum contribution to the general wel-\nfare,\u201d 42 U.S.C. 2011(a), and to \u201cimprove the general \nwelfare, increase the standard of living, and \nstrengthen free competition in private enterprise.\u201d  42 \nU.S.C. 2011(b).  Congress found that the development, \nutilization, and control of atomic energy was \u201cvital to \nthe common defense and security.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 2012(a).  \nA central purpose of the AEA was to maximize peace-\nful development and utilization of atomic energy.  42 \nU.S.C. 2013(d).  See, e.g., Pac. Gas & Elec. Co. v. State \nEnergy Res. Conservation & Dev. Comm\u2019n, 461 U.S. \n190, 207 (1983) (AEA enacted to \u201cencourage[\u200a] the pri-\nvate sector\u201d to develop \u201catomic energy for peaceful pur-\nposes under a program of federal regulation and li-\ncensing\u201d). \nThe AEA created a new agency, the Atomic Energy \nCommission.  Among its chief tasks was to oversee the \npossession and use of nuclear materials.  Congress \nfound that \u201cthe processing and utilization of source, \nbyproduct, and special nuclear material affect inter-\nstate and foreign commerce and must be regulated in \nthe national interest,\u201d and that the \u201cprocessing and \nutilization of source, byproduct, and special nuclear \nmaterial must be regulated in the national interest \nand in order to provide for the common defense and \n\n6 \nsecurity and to protect the health and safety of the \npublic.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 2012(c), (d).  To that end, Congress \nbroadly tasked the AEA to \u201cestablish by rule, regula-\ntion, or order, such standards and instructions to gov-\nern the possession and use of special nuclear material, \nsource material, and byproduct material as the Com-\nmission may deem necessary or desirable to promote \nthe common defense and security or to protect health \nor to minimize danger to life or property.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \n2201(b). \nSpent nuclear fuel fits squarely within this ex-\npress delegation of authority.  It is composed of \u201cspe-\ncial nuclear material,\u201d such as enriched uranium and \nplutonium, \u201csource material,\u201d such as natural ura-\nnium, and \u201cbyproduct material,\u201d which includes other \nradioactive material produced by nuclear fission.  ISP \nPet. App. 22a; see 42 U.S.C. 2014(e)(3)(a) and (aa) (de-\nfining terms).  In addition to 42 U.S.C. 2201(b), which \ncharged the Commission with developing rules and \nregulations for the possession and use of such materi-\nals, separate provisions addressed \u201cdomestic distribu-\ntion\u201d of each of the constituent elements of spent nu-\nclear fuel and authorized the Commission to issue li-\ncenses to private parties to possess such materials for \nvarious purposes.  42 U.S.C. 2073, 2092, 2093, 2111.   \nThe different enumerated purposes for licensing of \nspecial nuclear material and source material included \ncertain research and development activities, medical \ntherapy, and use in production (e.g., certain isotope \nproduction) and utilization (e.g., nuclear power plant) \nfacilities.  And, separately and importantly, for \u201csuch \nother uses as the commission determines to be appro-\npriate to carry out the purposes of this chapter\u201d (42 \n\n7 \nU.S.C. 2073(a)(4))1 and \u201cfor any other use approved by \nthe Commission as an aid to science or industry.\u201d 42 \nU.S.C. 2093(a)(4).  The identified purposes for licens-\ning of byproduct materials included research and med-\nical uses, as well as \u201cindustrial uses\u201d and \u201csuch other \nuseful applications as may be developed.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \n2111(a). \n2.\nCongress amended the AEA in 1974 to create \nthe Nuclear Regulatory Commission (\u201cNRC\u201d or \u201cCom-\nmission\u201d), an independent regulatory commission \nwhich assumed the broad authority under the AEA to \nregulate the civilian possession and use of radioactive \nmaterials.  Energy Reorganization Act of 1974, Pub. L. \nNo. 93-438, 88 Stat. 1233.  That amendment also cre-\nated a separate agency, which ultimately became the \nDepartment of Energy (\u201cDOE\u201d), which assumed devel-\nopmental functions from the Atomic Energy Commis-\nsion. \n3.\nIn 1978, pursuant to the above-noted provisions \nof the AEA, the NRC issued a proposed rule for notice \nand comment.  The rule, which provided for the pos-\nsession of spent nuclear fuel \u201cat installations built spe-\ncifically for this [storage] that are not coupled to either \na nuclear power plant or a fuel reprocessing plant.\u201d  \n1 42 U.S.C. 2073(a)(4) was added in 1958, Pub. L. No. 85-\n681, 72 Stat. 632 (Aug. 19, 1958).  That addition was a \u201ccorrection \nof a drafting deficiency\u201d and \u201cnot a material change,\u201d to confirm \nthat the AEC had authority to issue licenses for \u201cindustrial use of \nspecial nuclear material\u201d that were \u201cnot strictly research and de-\nvelopment.\u201d  Hearings before the Subcommittee on Legislation of \nthe Joint Committee on Atomic Energy, at 12, 85th Cong., 2d Sess. \n(July 10, 17, and 18, 1958) (statement of Mr. Hollingworth, Assis-\ntant General Manager for Administration, Atomic Energy Com-\nmission). \n\n8 \nStorage of Spent Nuclear Fuel in an Independent \nSpent Fuel Storage Installation (ISFSI): Proposed \nRule, 43 Fed. Reg. 46,309 (Oct. 6, 1978).  After exten-\nsive public comments (none of which challenged the \nNRC\u2019s authority to promulgate such a rule), the NRC \npromulgated a final rule to that effect in 1980.  Licens-\ning Requirements for the Storage of Spent Fuel in an \nIndependent Fuel Spent Storage Installation, 45 Fed. \nReg. 74,693 (Nov. 12, 1980).  These regulations have \ntherefore been on the books at 10 C.F.R. Part 72 for \nmore than forty years. \n4.\nIn the many decades since, the NRC has been \nopen, public, and transparent about its exercise of the \nauthority to license interim away-from-reactor storage \nof spent nuclear fuel.  E.g., General Electric Co.; Re-\nnewal of Materials License for the Storage of Spent \nFuel, 47 Fed. Reg. 20,231 (May 11, 1982) (renewal of \nmaterials license SNM-2500 for away-from-reactor \nspent fuel storage facility in Morris, Illinois); Public \nService Co. of Colorado; Issuance of Materials License \nSNM-2504, Ft. St. Vrain Independent Spent Fuel Stor-\nage; Installation at the Ft. St. Vrain Nuclear Generat-\ning Station, 56 Fed. Reg. 57,539 (Nov. 12, 1991) (ma-\nterials license issued under 10 C.F.R. Part 72 at site of \ndecommissioning reactor); Private Fuel Storage, Lim-\nited Liability Company; Notice of Issuance of Materi-\nals License SNM-2513 for the Private Fuel Storage Fa-\ncility, 71 Fed. Reg. 10,068 (Feb. 28, 2006) (materials \nlicense for away-from-reactor spent fuel storage facil-\nity in Tooele County, Utah).  See also Bullcreek v. \nNRC, 359 F.3d 536, 543 (D.C. Cir. 2004) (noting the \nexistence of three \u201cprivate away-from-reactor storage \nfacilities\u201d at the time of the passage of the Nuclear \nWaste Policy Act in 1982; 45 Fed. Reg. at 74,698). \n\n9 \n5.\nTwo years after the NRC promulgated Part 72 \nof Title 10 of the Code of Federal Regulations, \nCongress passed the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, \nPub. L. No. 97-425, 96 Stat. 2201 (codified as amended \nat 42 U.S.C. 10101 et seq.) (\u201cNWPA\u201d).  Congress was \nfully aware of the NRC\u2019s Part 72 away-from-reactor \nspent nuclear fuel storage regulations, and aware also \nthat the NRC had asserted authority under the AEA \nto license such possession of spent nuclear fuel.  E.g., \nS. REP. NO. 97-282, at 44 (1981).  Although the AEA is \nmentioned several times in the text of the NWPA (e.g., \n42 U.S.C. 10141(b), 10155(a)(1)(A)(i)), there is no \nreference to, much less a revocation of, the NRC\u2019s Part \n72 authority under the AEA to license away-from-\nreactor storage of spent nuclear fuel. \nThe NWPA created a comprehensive scheme for \nthe ownership and permanent disposal of spent nu-\nclear fuel by DOE, not private parties.  It created ac-\nceptance and disposal duties regarding spent nuclear \nfuel on the part of DOE, not the NRC.  See Don\u2019t Waste \nMich. v. NRC, No. 21-1048, 2023 WL 395030, at *1 \n(D.C. Cir. Jan. 25, 2023) (\u201cStorage and disposal, how-\never, are different concepts.\u201d).  Congress designated \nYucca Mountain, Nevada as the permanent disposal \nrepository site, Pub. L. No. 107-200, 116 Stat. 735 \n(2002), but DOE efforts to license the project with the \nNRC, and then construct and operate Yucca Mountain, \nhave effectively ceased, and the project remains \ndormant.  See In re Aiken County, 725 F.3d 255 257-\n259 (D.C. Cir. 2013).  Accordingly, DOE is in breach of \nits acceptance and disposal obligations under the \nNWPA.  E.g., Ind. Mich. Power Co. v. United States, \n422 F.3d 1369, 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2005) (\u201cpartial breach\u201d).  \nPrivate parties are therefore being forced to store \n\n10 \nspent nuclear fuel in larger quantities, and for longer \ndurations, than Congress, or anyone else, desired or \nexpected.  E.g., Texas v. United States, 891 F.3d 553, \n555 (5th Cir. 2018). \n6.\nThe AEA allows any person whose interest may \nbe affected by the issuance of a license to request a \nhearing before the NRC.  42 U.S.C. 2239(a)(1)(A).  Ju-\nrisdiction for courts to review challenges to such li-\ncenses is granted by the Hobbs Act, 28 U.S.C. 2344, \nwhich is exclusive and which limits judicial review to \na \u201cparty aggrieved\u201d by the agency proceeding\u2014that is, \na person who has become a \u201cparty\u201d to the agency pro-\nceeding.  If a person is denied \u201cparty\u201d status by the \nagency, then that determination itself is appealable \npursuant to 42 U.S.C. 2239(b)(1).  Thus, to be able to \npursue judicial review under the statute, a person \nmust either be a \u201cparty\u201d to the agency proceeding, or \nat least have attempted to become a \u201cparty\u201d to those \nproceedings.  This jurisdictional provision of the Hobbs \nAct applies not just to the NRC, but also to the Federal \nCommunications Commission, Department of Agricul-\nture, Department of Transportation, Federal Maritime \nCommission, and Surface Transportation Board.  28 \nU.S.C. 2342(1)-(7). \nII.\nFacts and proceedings below.  \n1.\nIn April 2016, one of ISP\u2019s joint venture mem-\nbers submitted an application (subsequently assumed \nand pursued by ISP) to the NRC for a license to tem-\nporarily store spent nuclear fuel from civilian nuclear \npower facilities at a consolidated interim storage facil-\nity.  The facility was to be constructed adjacent to, but \nseparate from, an existing low-level radiological waste \ndisposal facility in Andrews County, Texas.   \n\n11 \nInitially, ISP had strong support from the State of \nTexas, as well as from local communities in west \nTexas.  Then-Governor Rick Perry called for a Texas \nsolution to the issue of temporary storage of spent nu-\nclear fuel, rather than ceding the efforts to potential \nprojects in other states.  J.A. 1.  The Texas Radiation \nAdvisory Board issued a position stating that it was in \nthe state\u2019s best interest to support a facility in the \nstate, and Andrews County passed a unanimous reso-\nlution in support.  J.A. 6. \n2.\nIn August 2018, the NRC published notice of its \nconsideration of the license application in the Federal \nRegister pursuant to its regulations, along with in-\nstructions regarding how interested parties and enti-\nties could petition for a hearing and intervene in the \nNRC proceedings. \nA number of parties made various filings with the \nNRC between September and November 2018, chal-\nlenging the issuance of the license on multiple \ngrounds.  Challenges included assertions that the pro-\nposed license violated the NWPA because it was based \nupon an assumption that DOE would illegally take ti-\ntle to spent nuclear fuel, and that the license could not \nlegally be granted because of failures of the NRC to \ncomply with the National Environmental Policy Act in \nvarious ways.  Fasken was one of the parties who tried \nto challenge the license at the agency level, seeking to \nassert an out-of-time contention regarding treatment \nof emergency response costs in the environmental im-\npact statement, and to reopen the evidentiary record \nbased upon alleged deficiencies in the environmental \nreport regarding transportation routes.  An NRC ad-\nministrative hearings board ultimately dismissed or \n\n12 \ndenied all of the challenges, and those determinations \nwere upheld by the full Commission upon appeal.  In \nre Interim Storage Partners LLC, CLI-20-13, 92 N.R.C. \n457 (Dec. 4, 2020); In re Interim Storage Partners LLC, \nCLI-20-14, 92 N.R.C. 463 (Dec. 17, 2020); In re Interim \nStorage Partners LLC, CLI-20-15, 92 N.R.C. 491 (Dec. \n17, 2020); In re Interim Storage Partners LLC, CLI-21-\n09, 93 N.R.C. 244 (June 22, 2021). \nMeanwhile, Texas, now governed by a new admin-\nistration, had reversed its position and opposed the \nproject.  However, Texas elected not to participate in \nthe NRC adjudicatory proceedings pursuant to the \nNRC\u2019s rules, as states and interested parties fre-\nquently do.  E.g., 10 C.F.R. 2.309(h).  Instead, Texas \nsubmitted comment letters to the NRC regarding a \ndraft Environmental Impact Statement.  J.A. 115-122.  \nAnd, on the eve of the issuance of the license, Texas \nobjected upon the basis of a just-passed Texas law pro-\nhibiting the storage of spent nuclear fuel in the state.  \nJ.A. 215-216. \n3.\nVarious of the groups that had properly sought \nto participate in the NRC adjudicatory process, includ-\ning Fasken, filed petitions in the D.C. Circuit under \nthe Hobbs Act.  The D.C. Circuit ultimately dismissed \nor denied all of those petitions on the merits.  Don\u2019t \nWaste Mich., 2023 WL 395030, at *2-3.  As to the vio-\nlation-of-NWPA claims, the court observed that the li-\ncense contemplated storage of privately owned spent \nnuclear fuel, and the AEA and implementing regula-\ntions \u201cpermit[\u200a] the NRC \u2018to license and regulate the \nstorage and disposal of [spent nuclear] fuel.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Don\u2019t \nWaste Mich., 2023 WL 395030, at *1 (quoting Bull-\ncreek, 359 F.3d at 538).  The court dismissed separate \n\n13 \nlate-filed appeals purporting to challenge the issuance \nof the license itself (as distinguished from the NRC ad-\njudicatory orders), on the grounds that the petitioners\u2019 \nfailures to assert such claims before the NRC meant \nthat they could not establish that they were \u201cparties \naggrieved\u201d under the Hobbs Act.  Don\u2019t Waste Mich., \n2023 WL 395030, at *3 (citing Ohio Nuclear-Free Net-\nwork v. NRC, 53 F.4th 236, 239 (D.C. Cir. 2022)).  Fi-\nnally, as to Fasken\u2019s claims that the NRC had erred by \nrefusing to admit Fasken\u2019s late-filed contention and \ndeclining to reopen the record, the court held that \n\u201c[n]either claim has merit.\u201d  Ibid.\n4.\nThe State of New Mexico, like Texas, also did \nnot participate in the NRC adjudicatory process, but \nfiled a challenge to the license in the Tenth Circuit.  \nThat court dismissed the petition for review due to \nNew Mexico\u2019s failure to participate as required at the \nagency level.  State ex rel. Balderas v. NRC, 59 F.4th \n1112, 1124 (10th Cir. 2023). \n5.\nTexas, along with Fasken, filed petitions in the \nFifth Circuit, challenging the NRC\u2019s issuance of the li-\ncense on multiple grounds.  ISP intervened.  The NRC \nmoved to dismiss the appeals for lack of jurisdiction \nunder the Hobbs Act.  The court carried that motion \nwith the case. \nThe Fifth Circuit rejected the NRC\u2019s standing and \njurisdictional challenges to the Texas and Fasken pe-\ntitions.  The court, in dicta, expressed disagreement \nwith the D.C. Circuit and \u201cat least one other circuit\u201d \nregarding interpretation of the Hobbs Act\u2019s aggrieved-\nparty requirement.  ISP Pet. App. 10a-21a; see Ohio \nNuclear-Free Network, 53 F.4th at 239; Balderas, 59 \nF.4th at 1117.  But then, as the panel\u2019s actual basis for \n\n14 \nhearing the case, the Fifth Circuit applied a purported \n\u201cultra vires exception\u201d to statutory standing require-\nments under the Hobbs Act.  ISP Pet. App. 19a.  The \nFifth Circuit acknowledged that the \u201cultra vires\u201d posi-\ntion upon which it rested jurisdiction had not been \nadopted by any other circuit and had been expressly \nrejected by the Second, Seventh, Tenth, and Eleventh \nCircuits.  ISP Pet. App. 19a n.3. \nThe Fifth Circuit therefore determined to reach \nthe merits of the subset of arguments by Texas and \nFasken that the court deemed to be claims of \u201cultra \nvires\u201d agency action.  ISP Pet. App. 19a.  In doing so, \nit held that the AEA does not authorize the Commis-\nsion to license a private, away-from reactor storage fa-\ncility for spent nuclear fuel, dismissing contrary rul-\nings by the D.C. Circuit (in Bullcreek, 359 F.3d at 538), \nand the Tenth Circuit (in Skull Valley Band of Goshute \nIndians v. Nielson, 376 F.3d 1223, 1232 (10th Cir. \n2004)), as \u201cunpersuasive\u201d and \u201cunhelpful\u201d based upon \na lack of \u201ctextual analysis\u201d of the AEA in those deci-\nsions.  ISP Pet. App. 21a-26a.  The Fifth Circuit fur-\nther held that the NWPA \u201cdoesn\u2019t permit\u201d the activity \nauthorized by the ISP license.  ISP Pet. App. 21a-30a.  \nFinally, the Fifth Circuit observed that treatment of \nnuclear waste \u201chas been hotly contested for over a half \ncentury.\u201d  ISP Pet. App. 30a.  That debate supposedly \nimplicated the \u201cmajor questions\u201d doctrine described in \nWest Virginia v. EPA, 597 U.S. 697 (2022), which the \nFifth Circuit held to further support its result. \n6.\nThe government and ISP each moved for re-\nhearing en banc.  By a 9-7 vote of eligible judges, the \nfull court denied review.  ISP Pet. App. 33a.  A concur-\nrence of six judges expanded on the panel\u2019s dicta \n\n15 \nregarding the Hobbs Act, and further elaborated on \nthe ultra vires doctrine on which the panel rested ju-\nrisdiction.  A dissent of four judges explained that the \ncourt\u2019s \u201cexercise of jurisdiction has grave consequences \nfor regulated entities\u2019 settled expectations and careful \ninvestments in costly, time-consuming agency pro-\nceedings, inviting spoilers to sidestep the avenues for \nparticipation that Congress carefully crafted to pre-\nvent this uncertainty.\u201d  ISP Pet. App. 46a (Higginson, \nJ., dissenting). \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nThe Fifth Circuit made multiple consequential er-\nrors in this case.  This Court should correct those er-\nrors and reverse the judgment of the Fifth Circuit. \nFirst, the Fifth Circuit should not have enter-\ntained the petitions by Texas and Fasken.  To do so, it \nresurrected an atextual \u201cultra vires exception\u201d to the \nHobbs Act\u2019s judicial review provisions.  Under that \ndoctrine, a mere allegation that an agency exceeded its \nstatutory authority automatically allows a circuit \ncourt to hear the challenge, regardless of the standing \nrequirements imposed by the statute.  That doctrine\u2014\nwhich before this case seemed destined for the dustbin \nof history\u2014was originally based on dubious dicta from \na 1982 Fifth Circuit decision.  Am. Trucking Ass\u2019ns, \nInc. v. ICC, 673 F.2d 82, 85 n.4 (5th Cir. 1982).  Since \nthen, every single time that the doctrine has been con-\nsidered by another circuit, it has been rejected, creat-\ning splits between the Fifth Circuit and the Second, \nSeventh, Tenth, and Eleventh Circuits.  State ex rel. \nBalderas v. NRC, 59 F.4th 1112, 1123-1124 (10th Cir. \n2023); Nat\u2019l Ass\u2019n of State Util. Consumer Advocs. v. \nFCC, 457 F.3d 1238, 1249 (11th Cir. 2006), modified \n\n16 \non other grounds on denial of reh\u2019g, 468 F.3d 1272 \n(11th Cir. 2006) (per curiam); Erie-Niagara Rail Steer-\ning Comm. v. Surface Trans. Bd., 167 F.3d 111, 112-\n113 (2d Cir. 1999) (per curiam); In re: Chi., Milwaukee, \nSt. Paul & Pac. R.R., 799 F.2d 317, 334-335 (7th Cir. \n1986).  As those other circuits have cogently explained, \nnot only is the doctrine unsupported, it is arbitrary \nand unworkable.  A clever litigant can frame many al-\nlegations of wrongful agency action as the agency \u201cex-\nceeding its authority,\u201d which would effectively render \nCongress\u2019s judicial review limitations meaningless.  \nThat is judicial aggrandizement of the highest order, \nand the Court should reject it. \nSecond, the Court should reject any argument that \nrespondents might make that they are \u201cparties ag-\ngrieved\u201d under the Hobbs Act.  The Fifth Circuit\u2019s \ndicta on this point cannot be reconciled with the actual \nstatutory language.  In the Hobbs Act, Congress lim-\nited judicial review to a \u201cparty aggrieved.\u201d  28 U.S.C. \n2344 (emphasis added).  Not a \u201cperson aggrieved.\u201d  \nThat word-choice is intentional and meaningful\u2014to be \na \u201cparty,\u201d under well-understood definitions of the \nterm, one must actually participate in the agency pro-\nceeding pursuant to its rules (or, at the very least, seek \nto so participate).  E.g., Simmons v. ICC, 716 F.2d 40, \n43 (D.C. Cir. 1983) (Scalia, J.).  Merely firing off objec-\ntions does not make one a \u201cparty\u201d to the agency pro-\nceedings under the Hobbs Act, when agency rules re-\nquire more.  Every other circuit that has considered \nthe issue has so held.  E.g., Ohio Nuclear-Free Network \nv. NRC, 53 F.4th 236, 239 (D.C. Cir. 2022); see also, \ne.g., Gage v. U.S. Atomic Energy Comm\u2019n, 479 F.2d \n1214, 1217-1218 (D.C. Cir. 1973); Balderas, 59 F.4th \nat 1116-1119. \n\n17 \nThird, on the merits, the Fifth Circuit misinter-\npreted the AEA.  The court erroneously concluded that \nthe statute never in fact authorized the NRC to ap-\nprove licenses for away-from-reactor temporary stor-\nage of spent nuclear fuel.  It did so even though the \nstatute charges the NRC with regulating \u201cpossession \nand use\u201d of each of the constituent elements of spent \nnuclear fuel in furtherance of development of atomic \npower, without locational restrictions.  42 U.S.C. \n2201(b); 2011(a); 2012(c), (d).  And, even though the \nstatute empowered the NRC to license possession and \nuse of the constituent elements of spent nuclear fuel \nfor uses determined by the agency to be \u201cappropriate\u201d \nfor carrying out the purposes of the AEA, as an \u201caid to \nscience or industry,\u201d and for \u201cindustrial uses,\u201d all of \nwhich comfortably encompass the temporary storage \nof civilian spent nuclear fuel, and none of which im-\npose geographic or locational restrictions.  42 U.S.C. \n2073(a)(4), 2093(a)(4), 2111(a).  And, even though NRC \nregulations providing for away-from-reactor storage of \nspent nuclear fuel\u2014published after extensive notice \nand comment rulemaking and in use for decades\u2014\nhave been on the books since 1980.  10 C.F.R. Part 72.  \nAnd, even though every other circuit that has looked \nat the issue has rejected the Fifth Circuit\u2019s reading.  \nSee Beyond Nuclear, Inc. v. NRC, 113 F.4th 956, 965 \n(D.C. Cir. 2024); Bullcreek, 359 F.3d at 538; Skull Val-\nley, 376 F.3d at 1232. \nTo get there, the Fifth Circuit invoked a sort of \nejusdem generis-type approach to infer that temporary \nstorage of spent nuclear fuel may only be for \u201cresearch \nand development\u201d purposes.  ISP Pet. App. 22a.  The \nFifth Circuit, however, inexplicably failed to consider \nthe statutory provisions that did not fit its desired \n\n18 \nresult.  Moreover, the relevant statutory language and \nstructures\u2014which involved no \u201clist\u201d nor any \u201ccommon\u201d \nlink or attribute\u2014are in any event not susceptible to \nthe type of interpretive restriction imposed by the \nFifth Circuit.  E.g., Harrington v. Purdue Pharma, \nL.P., 144 S. Ct. 2071, 2082 (2024); Ali v. Fed. Bureau \nof Prisons, 552 U.S. 214, 225 (2008).  At bottom, the \nFifth Circuit and respondents fundamentally err in at \nleast two ways: (a) by impermissibly reading im-\nportant portions of the statute as meaningless, see \nCorley v. United States, 556 U.S. 303, 314 (2009); and \n(b) by impermissibly imposing a material condition, \nnamely an \u201cat-reactor\u201d locational limitation on the \ntemporary storage of spent nuclear fuel, that cannot \nbe found in the statute.  E.g., Borden v. United States, \n593 U.S. 420, 436 (2021); Romag Fasteners, Inc. v. Fos-\nsil, Inc., 590 U.S. 212, 215 (2020). \nFourth, nothing in the statute supports the Fifth \nCircuit\u2019s alternative holding that the NWPA \u201cdoesn\u2019t \npermit\u201d the license at issue here.  ISP Pet. App. 30a.  \nNor can the result by the Fifth Circuit be justified by \nsome purported \u201cpolicy,\u201d \u201ccontext,\u201d or \u201cscheme\u201d of the \nNWPA.  ISP Pet. App. 21a, 29a, 30a.  On the contrary, \nthe \u201ccontext\u201d of the NWPA is Congress\u2019s awareness of \nthe NRC\u2019s preexisting authority under the AEA to do \nexactly what it did in this case, which the NWPA did \nnothing to repeal or question.  See S. REP. NO. 97-282, \nat 44 (1981); Bullcreek, 359 F.3d at 542.  The NWPA is \nself-evidently concerned with permanent disposal of \nspent nuclear fuel by the DOE, not temporary storage\nof spent nuclear fuel by private parties.  E.g., Don\u2019t \nWaste Mich., 2023 WL 395030, at *1 (\u201cStorage and dis-\nposal, however, are different concepts.\u201d).  Every other \ncircuit that has looked at the NWPA\u2019s application to \n\n19 \nthis issue has concluded exactly the opposite of what \nthe Fifth Circuit held here.  Skull Valley, 376 F.3d at \n1232-1233; Balderas, 59 F.4th at 1115, 1121; Beyond \nNuclear, 113 F.4th at 965.  Once again, those circuits \nwere correct, and the Fifth Circuit here was not. \nARGUMENT \nI.\nThe Fifth Circuit Erred by Applying a \nJudge-Made \u201cUltra Vires Exception\u201d to \nStatutory Hobbs Act Requirements. \nThe Fifth Circuit erred by hearing this case at all \npursuant to its atextual, judge-made \u201cultra vires\u201d ex-\nception to Hobbs Act requirements.  In the Hobbs Act, \nCongress granted courts of appeals exclusive jurisdic-\ntion to review certain final orders of identified agen-\ncies, providing (in 28 U.S.C. 2342) that such \u201c[j]uris-\ndiction is invoked by filing a petition\u201d pursuant to 28 \nU.S.C. 2344.  The latter provision provides that \u201c[a]ny \nparty aggrieved\u201d may file suit in a court of appeals \nwithin sixty days of the final agency order to be chal-\nlenged.  The Fifth Circuit did not base its exercise of \njurisdiction on any finding that Texas and Fasken \nwere \u201cpart[ies] aggrieved\u201d under the Hobbs Act.  There \nis no textual support in the Hobbs Act, or any other \nstatute, for the ultra vires exception resurrected and \napplied by the Fifth Circuit to hear this case.  That \nnon-statutory exercise of jurisdiction was erroneous \nand should be reversed.  E.g., Bowles v. Russell, 551 \nU.S. 205, 214 (2007) (courts have \u201cno authority to cre-\nate equitable exceptions to jurisdictional require-\nments.\u201d). \nFirst, the doctrine contravenes the long-settled \nrule that courts of appeals have no authority to exer-\ncise jurisdiction that Congress withheld from them.  \n\n20 \nSee, e.g., Sheldon v. Sill, 49 U.S. 441, 449 (1850). Fed-\neral courts are courts of limited jurisdiction, and they \ncannot expand the powers that a statute confers on \nthem by judicial decree.  See, e.g., Kokkonen v. Guard-\nian Life Ins. Co. of Am., 511 U.S. 375, 377 (1994). \nThe Fifth Circuit\u2019s contrary rule has never been \nsufficiently justified\u2014even by the Fifth Circuit itself.  \nThe genesis of the ultra vires doctrine was a footnote, \nin dicta, in a 1982 Fifth Circuit decision involving the \nInterstate Commerce Commission.  Am. Trucking \nAss\u2019ns, Inc. v. ICC, 673 F.2d 82, 85 n.4 (5th Cir. 1982).  \nThat footnote contained no rationale or substantive \nanalysis, and exclusively cited ICC cases before 1975, \ni.e., before the ICC was even brought within the ambit \nof the Hobbs Act.  See Act of Jan. 2, 1975, Pub. L. No. \n93-584, \u00a7\u00a7 3, 4, 88 Stat. 1917 (1975).  Indeed, the actual \nholding of American Trucking was that intervention \nbefore the agency was, in fact, required as a prerequi-\nsite to judicial review under 28 U.S.C. 2344.  Am. \nTrucking, 673 F.2d at 85 (citing S. C. Loveland Co. v. \nUnited States, 534 F.2d 958, 961 (D.C. Cir. 1976); Gage\nv. U.S. Atomic Energy Comm\u2019n, 479 F.2d 1214, 1217-\n1221 (D.C. Cir. 1973)).  Two years later in a challenge \nto a rulemaking proceeding, the Fifth Circuit noted the \ndicta from the American Trucking footnote to enter-\ntain claims brought by non-parties to an ICC order, \nagain without analysis, discussion, nor citation to any \npost-1975 ICC Hobbs Act (or other) cases.  Wales \nTransp., Inc. v. ICC, 728 F.2d 774, 776 n.1 (5th Cir. \n1984).   \nThe Fifth Circuit itself has recognized the outlier \nstatus of its ultra vires doctrine.  E.g., ISP Pet. App. \n19a n.3, 42a n.5; see Merchs. Fast Motor Lines, Inc. v. \n\n21 \nICC, 5 F.3d 911, 922 n.16 (5th Cir. 1993) (noting that \n\u201cat least one other circuit\u201d declined to recognize the \nFifth Circuit\u2019s doctrine).  Yet rather than simply take \nthe opportunity upon en banc review in this case to \nalign itself with the correct majority view, the Fifth \nCircuit doubled down and resurrected the long-\ndormant principle. \nBelow, the six-judge opinion supporting the denial \nof en banc review identified no statutory basis for the \ncourt\u2019s exercise of jurisdiction, but belatedly defended \nthe panel\u2019s decision by invoking Leedom v. Kyne, 358 \nU.S. 184, 188 (1958), on which neither the panel nor \nthe parties had relied.  ISP Pet. App. 43a.  As the dis-\nsenting opinion correctly noted, however, this Court \nsubsequently clarified that Kyne has no applicability \nwhere, as here, there is a meaningful and adequate op-\nportunity for judicial review under the relevant stat-\nute.  ISP Pet. App. 51a n.2 (citing Bd. of Governors of \nFed. Rsrv. Sys. v. MCorp Fin., Inc., 502 U.S. 32, 43-44 \n(1991)).  Indeed, even the opinion supporting denial of \nen banc review \u201cagree[d]\u201d that this Court clarified \nKyne in MCorp.  ISP Pet. App. 43a n.6.  In short, there \nis no statutory authority or judicial precedent to sup-\nport what the Fifth Circuit did here. \nSecond, the uniform contrary precedent rejecting \nthe doctrine is compelling.  After American Trucking\nand Wales Transportation, litigants in other circuits \nperiodically tried to sidestep Hobbs Act requirements \nthrough the ultra vires grounds recited by the Fifth \nCircuit.  Those efforts were consistently, and persua-\nsively, rejected.  State ex rel. Balderas v. NRC, 59 F.4th \n1112, 1123-1124 (10th Cir. 2023); Nat\u2019l Ass\u2019n of State \nUtil. Consumer Advocs. v. FCC, 457 F.3d 1238, 1249 \n\n22 \n(11th Cir. 2006), modified on other grounds on denial \nof reh\u2019g, 468 F.3d 1272 (11th Cir. 2006) (per curiam); \nErie-Niagara Rail Steering Comm. v. Surface Trans. \nBd., 167 F.3d 111, 112-113 (2d Cir. 1999) (per curiam); \nIn re: Chi., Milwaukee, St. Paul & Pac. R.R., 799 F.2d \n317, 334-335 (7th Cir. 1986).  Unlike the Fifth Circuit \nin American Trucking and Wales Transportation, \nthose courts thoroughly analyzed\u2014and explained\u2014\nthe bases of their rulings, concluding (for example) \nthat the Fifth Circuit failed to acknowledge \u201cthe inter-\nvening change in governing procedure\u201d regarding re-\nview of ICC orders, and also failed to show why such a \nposition should \u201cremain valid today.\u201d  Erie-Niagara \nRail Steering Comm., 167 F.3d at 112.\nThird, there is no basis in logic, common sense, or \npolicy for the ultra vires exception, as the circum-\nstances of this very case confirm.  The Fifth Circuit\u2019s \nview was that Texas had made three merits argu-\nments, and Fasken had made four\u2014with both sets of \npetitioners including Administrative Procedure Act \nand other claims.  Of those, and pursuant to its \u201cultra \nvires\u201d ruling, the Fifth Circuit had to pick which of the \narguments qualified as an assertion that the agency \nexceeded its authority.  The court selected Texas\u2019s \nstatutory authority claim (but not its Administrative \nProcedure Act claim) and one of Fasken\u2019s two Admin-\nistrative Procedure Act claims (i.e., one invoking the \nNuclear Waste Policy Act).  ISP App. 20a-21a.  The ar-\nbitrary and unworkable nature of that type of ad hoc\napproach is plain: any clever litigant can frame an ar-\ngument of agency error as the agency exceeding its \nlawful authority.  That characterization, as Judge \nEasterbrook has aptly observed for the Seventh Cir-\ncuit, is merely \u201ca synonym for \u2018wrong.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Chi., \n\n23 \nMilwaukee, St. Paul & Pac. R.R., 799 F.2d at 335.  \nMoreover, the Fifth Circuit articulated no rationale \nthat would limit its ultra vires doctrine to just the \nHobbs Act\u2014if left to stand, the doctrine could truly \nrepresent a sea change in courts\u2019 ability to disregard \ncarefully crafted and long-settled congressionally \nmandated review schemes.  The \u201crisk for judicial ag-\ngrandizement when courts can pick and choose when \nto abide by Congress\u2019 limits\u201d is obvious.  ISP Pet. App. \n52a (Higginson, J., dissenting). \nII.\nThe Fifth Circuit\u2019s Dicta Regarding Hobbs \nAct \u201cParty Aggrieved\u201d Requirements Was \nErroneous. \nIn opposing certiorari, respondents primarily re-\nlied on arguments that the respondents were in fact \n\u201cparties aggrieved\u201d under the Hobbs Act (and the Fifth \nCircuit\u2019s dicta to that effect), rather than trying to de-\nfend the ultra vires exception pursuant to which the \nFifth Circuit actually heard the case.  (Texas Br. in \nOpp. 8-16; Fasken Br. in Opp. 24-32.)   \nContinuation of that strategy here would be una-\nvailing\u2014the Hobbs Act dicta by the Fifth Circuit is \nwrong, unsupported by the statute, and at odds with \nevery other relevant circuit precedent.  Respondents \ncan offer no good reason to upend decades of well-set-\ntled law regarding the applicable judicial review \nscheme, and this Court should not endorse the Fifth \nCircuit\u2019s aberrant views regarding the Hobbs Act. \nUnder the AEA, when an applicant seeks a \nmaterials license to possess spent nuclear fuel, \u201cthe \nCommission shall grant a hearing upon the request of \nany person whose interest may be affected by the \nproceeding, and shall admit any such person as a party \n\n24 \nto such proceeding.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 2239(a)(1)(A).  The \nNRC has promulgated regulations governing such \nhearings, e.g., 10 C.F.R. 2.309(a), (d), and (f), including \nprovisions specifically contemplating participation by \nStates.  10 C.F.R. 2.309(h).  The Hobbs Act vests courts \nof appeals with exclusive jurisdiction to review a \u201cfinal \norder\u201d of the Commission \u201centered in any proceeding\u201d \n\u201cgranting, suspending, revoking, or amending\u201d a \n\u201clicense.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 2342(4); 42 U.S.C. 2239(a)(1)(A) \nand (b)(1).  Jurisdiction for courts to review challenges \nto such licenses is limited to appeals by a \u201cparty \naggrieved\u201d by the agency proceeding\u2014that is, a person \nwho has become a \u201cparty\u201d to the agency proceeding.  28 \nU.S.C. 2344.  (If a person is denied \u201cparty\u201d status by \nthe agency, then that determination itself is \nappealable pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 2239(b)(1).) \nStart with the language of the statute: the right to \njudicial review was limited by Congress to a \u201cparty ag-\ngrieved.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 2344.  Not a \u201cperson\u201d aggrieved, as \nin other review statutes like the Administrative Pro-\ncedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 702.  That distinction is meaning-\nful, as then-Judge Scalia explained for the court in \nSimmons v. ICC, 716 F.2d 40, 43 (D.C. Cir. 1983)\u2014\n\u201c[t]o give meaning to that apparently intentional vari-\nation,\u201d the term \u201cparty\u201d in the Hobbs Act must be un-\nderstood as \u201creferring to a party before the agency, not \na party to the judicial proceeding.\u201d  Simmons, 716 F.2d \nat 43.  That understanding comports with settled, \nwell-understood meanings of the term in the law.  E.g., \nParty, BLACK\u2019S LAW DICTIONARY 1278 (4th ed. Rev. \n1968) (\u201c\u2018Party\u2019 is a technical word, and has a precise \nmeaning in legal parlance.  By it is understood he or \nthey by or against whom a suit is brought, * * * and all \n\n25 \nothers who may be affected by the suit are * * * persons \ninterested, but not parties.\u201d). \nAnd, without exception (until now), in numerous \ndecisions over the years courts have repeatedly con-\nfirmed the proposition that those who fail to \u201cproperly \nintervene[\u200a] in the underlying NRC proceeding * * * are \nnot \u2018parti[ies] aggrieved,\u2019\u200a\u201d and therefore may not seek \njudicial review under the Hobbs Act.  Ohio Nuclear-\nFree Network, 53 F.4th at 239; see also, e.g., Nat\u2019l \nParks Conservation Ass\u2019n v. FERC, 6 F.4th 1044, 1049-\n1050 (9th Cir. 2021); NRDC v. NRC, 823 F.3d 641, 643 \n(D.C. Cir. 2016); Gage, 479 F.2d at 1217-1218; Balde-\nras, 59 F.4th at 1116-1119.  That consistent line of ju-\ndicial interpretation carries great weight.  Cf. Loper \nBright Enters. v. Raimondo, 144 S. Ct. 2244, 2278 \n(2024) (Gorsuch, J., concurring) (\u201cMadison observed \nthat judicial rulings \u2018repeatedly confirmed\u2019 may supply \nbetter evidence of the law\u2019s meaning than isolated or \naberrant ones.\u201d (emphasis in original) (citing Letter \nfrom James Madison to Charles J. Ingersol (June 25, \n1831), in 4 LETTERS AND OTHER WRITINGS OF JAMES \nMADISON 184 (1867))). \nOther statutory indicia reinforce the principle.  \nSection 2348 provides that \u201cpart[ies] in interest in the \nproceeding before the agency\u201d may appear in judicial \nreview proceedings of their own motion and as of right, \nbut other entities \u201cwhose interests are affected by the \norder of the agency, may intervene.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 2348.  \nThat statutory distinction between judicial review as-\nof-right on the one hand, and permissive intervention \non the other, \u201cwould be defeated\u201d if a nonparty to the \nagency proceeding \u201ccould file its own petition for \n\n26 \nreview as a matter of right.\u201d  Ala. Power Co. v. FCC, \n311 F.3d 1357, 1366 (11th Cir. 2002). \nFor a formal agency hearing implicated by a re-\nquest for a spent nuclear fuel materials license such as \nin this case, merely dashing off emails, letters, or even \na set of lengthy comments to the agency does not make \none a \u201cparty.\u201d  Just as filing an amicus brief in a court \ndoes not confer party status or entitle the amici to pur-\nsue an appeal in its own right, pursuit of an action in \ncourt is limited to \u201cparties.\u201d  E.g., FED. R. APP. P. 3-4.  \nAs Judge Easterbrook observed in another Hobbs Act \ncase, \u201c[i]f a non-party tried to appeal from a judgment \nof a district court,\u201d a court would summarily \u201cdismiss \nthe appeal.\u201d  Chi., Milwaukee, St. Paul & Pac. R.R., \n799 F.2d at 334-335.   \nRespondents, the Fifth Circuit\u2019s dicta, and the \nopinion in support of denial of en banc review have \npointed to cases where the mere submission of com-\nments in an agency rulemaking may be enough to con-\nfer \u201cparty\u201d status for purposes of such proceedings gov-\nerned by the Hobbs Act.  ISP App. 17a-19a, 37a-38a; \nTexas Br. in Opp. 9-10, 15.  Here, however, that anal-\nogy misses the mark.  Rulemakings (which are not at \nissue here) and adjudicatory agency proceedings \n(which are) are fundamentally different.  Who can \nfairly be said to be a \u201cparty\u201d to a notice and comment \nrulemaking, if not a person who submits comments in \naccordance with agency rules?  That conclusion simply \napplies the words of the statute to the particular \nagency procedure at issue, and courts have consist-\nently and sensibly recognized that the nature of the \nagency proceeding can dictate what is required to con-\nfer \u201cparty\u201d status.  E.g., Water Transp. Ass\u2019n v. ICC, \n\n27 \n819 F.2d 1189, 1192 (D.C. Cir. 1987) (the \u201cdegree of \nparticipation necessary to achieve party status varies \naccording to the formality with which the proceeding \nwas conducted.\u201d).  But even in rulemakings, an inter-\nested person must comply with procedures regarding \nproper submission of comments\u2014slipping a handwrit-\nten note under the door of the agency headquarters af-\nter the deadline for comments has passed would not \nsuffice.  E.g., Ala. Power Co. v. ICC, 852 F.2d 1361, \n1368 (D.C. Cir. 1988) (denying \u201cparty\u201d status in a rule-\nmaking proceeding where petitioner\u2019s submission fell \n\u201cshort of that required in the type of ICC proceeding at \nissue here.\u201d).  The specifics of what is required to be-\ncome a \u201cparty\u201d may vary depending on the particular \nagency action at issue, but that does not mean that a \nperson who intentionally eschews available agency \nprocedures for becoming a party can nevertheless then \nclaim \u201cparty\u201d status and appeal the agency determina-\ntion to a circuit court.  See, e.g., Balderas, 59 F.4th at \n1118 (\u201cThe appropriateness and availability of these \nprocedures differ when agencies enact rules and adju-\ndicate disputes.\u201d). \nContrary to the concurring opinion below, ISP Pet. \nApp. 35a, this case does not implicate any lack of avail-\nable judicial review or threaten the judiciary\u2019s role un-\nder Marbury v. Madison, 5 U.S. 137 (1803).  Neither \nrespondent was denied a day in court, nor was the \nNRC in \u201ccontrol [of] the courthouse door.\u201d  ISP Pet. \nApp. 34a.  Just the opposite\u2014Fasken actually had its \nday in court in the D.C. Circuit on the issues properly \nraised at the agency level, but it did not prevail.  Don\u2019t \nWaste Mich., 2023 WL 395030, at *3.  With regard to \nTexas, the NRC regulations explicitly provide for po-\ntential participation by States, 10 C.F.R. 2.309(h), and \n\n28 \nStates routinely challenge NRC licensing actions at \nboth the agency level and in courts pursuant to the \nHobbs Act.  E.g., N.J. Dep\u2019t of Env\u2019t Prot. v. NRC, 561 \nF.3d 132, 135 (3d Cir. 2009) (New Jersey); Palisades \nNuclear Plant & Big Rock Point, CLI-22-08, 2022 WL \n18355239, at *10 n.76 (N.R.C. July 15, 2022) (Michi-\ngan); In re Entergy Nuclear Vt. Yankee, CLI-16-12, \n2016 WL 3476306, at *2 n.28 (N.R.C. June 23, 2016) \n(Vermont).  Here, Texas was for the license, and then \nagainst it, but for whatever reason did not take the \nsteps that were fully available to it for participation at \nthe agency level, which would have opened the \u201ccourt-\nhouse door.\u201d  The Fifth Circuit\u2019s departure from long-\nsettled law in this case was not necessary to ensure \navailability of meaningful judicial review. \nFinally with respect to the Hobbs Act and justicia-\nbility, the severe negative repercussions of the Fifth \nCircuit\u2019s ruling in this case should be considered.  If \nany person can sue in court at any time to block or va-\ncate an NRC-issued license without even trying to par-\nticipate before the agency, why continue to have exten-\nsive safety-based adjudicatory hearings at the agency \nlevel at all?  For decades, the NRC has relied upon \nsuch adjudicatory proceedings to protect the health \nand safety of the public.  ISP spent many years and \nmillions of dollars to secure its license in this case.  \nThat was all rendered for naught, however, with the \nbelated stroke of a pen by the Fifth Circuit.  If that is \nthe new normal, rational business entities are unlikely \nto take on that type of risk, expense, and uncertainty \nfor future nuclear projects.  The impacts for a crucial, \ncapital-intensive industry, at a critical time of new \ntechnologies and opportunities, would be potentially \ncatastrophic.  As the dissent to denial of en banc review \n\n29 \ncorrectly recognized, the \u201cgrave consequences\u201d of the \nFifth Circuit\u2019s decision here for an industry that is a \nsubstantial source of the nation\u2019s power, and most of \nits actual and potential non-carbon-based generation \nof electricity, can hardly be overstated.  ISP Pet. App. \n46a. \nIII.\nThe Atomic Energy Act Permits the NRC to \nLicense Private Parties to Temporarily \nPossess Spent Nuclear Fuel Away from the \nNuclear Reactor That Generated the Spent \nNuclear Fuel. \nA.\nLicenses for Temporary Away-From-\nReactor Possession of Spent Nuclear \nFuel Fall Within the NRC\u2019s Expressly \nDelegated Authority. \nThe authority of the NRC to license private parties \nto temporarily store spent nuclear fuel away from the \nreactor that generated the fuel is comfortably estab-\nlished by the terms of the AEA itself, and confirmed by \nthe relevant history, context, and consistent judicial \nrulings to that effect. \nSpent nuclear fuel is composed of special nuclear \nmaterial, source material, and byproduct material.  \nISP Pet. App. 22a; see, e.g., Bullcreek, 359 F.3d at 538.  \nFrom that undisputed factual premise, the legal con-\nclusion readily follows.  Again, start with the words of \nthe statute: Section 161(b) of the AEA, 42 U.S.C. \n2201(b), tasks the NRC with the responsibility to \u201ces-\ntablish by rule, regulation, or order\u201d the \u201cstandards \nand instructions to govern the possession and use\u201d of \nall of the constituent elements of spent nuclear fuel \nthat the NRC deems \u201cnecessary or desirable to pro-\nmote the common defense and security or to protect \n\n30 \nhealth or to minimize danger to life or property.\u201d  Con-\ngress confirmed that \u201ccommon defense and security\u201d \nincludes \u201cdevelopment, utilization, and control of \natomic energy for military and all other purposes,\u201d and \nalso confirmed that the \u201cprocessing and utilization\u201d of \nthe constituent elements of spent nuclear fuel \u201cmust \nbe regulated\u201d by the NRC \u201cin the national interest,\u201d to \n\u201cprotect the health and safety of the public.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \n2011(a); 2012(c), (d).  With the development of a do-\nmestic nuclear power industry and the consequent po-\ntential need to store spent nuclear fuel away from op-\nerating reactors, it plainly fell within the NRC\u2019s man-\ndate\u2014indeed, it was the agency\u2019s duty\u2014to regulate \nsuch possession and use to safeguard the public health \nand safety. \nAdditional statutory provisions regarding the pos-\nsession and use of each of the three constituent ele-\nments of spent nuclear fuel point to the same conclu-\nsion.  For special nuclear material, the NRC is author-\nized to issue licenses for possession for research and \ndevelopment regarding atomic energy (42 U.S.C. \n2073(a)(1)), for research and development regarding \nmedical uses (42 U.S.C. 2073(a)(2)), for use in utiliza-\ntion facilities (i.e., power plants) or production facili-\nties (i.e., certain isotope production plants) (42 U.S.C. \n2073(a)(3)), and\u2014significantly and separately\u2014for \n\u201csuch other uses as the Commission determines to be \nappropriate to carry out the purposes of this chapter.\u201d  \n42 U.S.C. 2073(a)(4) (emphasis supplied).   \nSimilarly, for source material, the NRC is author-\nized to issue licenses for possession for research and \ndevelopment regarding atomic energy (42 U.S.C. \n2093(a)(1)), for research and development regarding \n\n31 \nmedical uses (42 U.S.C. 2093(a)(2)), for use in utiliza-\ntion facilities (i.e., power plants) or production facili-\nties (i.e., certain isotope production plants) (42 U.S.C. \n2093(a)(3)), and\u2014significantly and separately\u2014for \n\u201cfor any other use approved by the Commission as an \naid to science or industry.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 2093(a)(4) (em-\nphasis supplied).  \nFor byproduct material, the Commission was au-\nthorized to issue licenses for use in research and devel-\nopment, medical therapy, and agricultural uses, but \nalso \u201cindustrial uses,\u201d and \u201csuch other useful applica-\ntions as may be developed.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 2111(a) (empha-\nsis supplied). \nNowhere in this statutory scheme does Congress \nplace artificial limits on the NRC\u2019s ability to license \npossession or use of these materials.  On the contrary, \nCongress made clear that the \u201cpurposes of this chap-\nter\u201d and the \u201cindustry\u201d and \u201cindustrial uses\u201d that the \nNRC was charged with considering for regulation of \nspecial nuclear, source, and byproduct material \nbroadly encompassed the \u201cdevelopment, use, and con-\ntrol of atomic energy.\u201d 42 U.S.C. 2011(a).  Congress \nfurther decreed that the agency should endeavor to \n\u201cstrengthen free competition in private enterprise\u201d in \npursuing its regulatory mission.  42 U.S.C. 2011(b).  \nThe project to be licensed by the NRC in this case\u2014a \nprivate, away-from-reactor installation to facilitate \nthe use of atomic energy by temporarily storing the re-\nsulting used nuclear fuel\u2014falls within the bull\u2019s eye of \nthe industrial purposes that the AEA was enacted to \naddress and that the NRC was charged to regulate. \nIn short, the best reading of these provisions\u2014in-\ndeed, the only plausible reading\u2014is that the NRC is \n\n32 \nacting well within the authority delegated to it by Con-\ngress in the AEA when the NRC regulates the tempo-\nrary storage of spent nuclear fuel by a private party.  \nEach of the delegations just discussed is a classic ex-\nample of Congress empowering the NRC \u201cto regulate \nsubject to the limits imposed by a term or phrase that \n\u2018leaves [the agency] with flexibility.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Loper Bright En-\nters. v. Raimondo, 144 S. Ct. 2244, 2263 & n.6 (2024) \n(citation omitted).  Nothing in the AEA limits the \nNRC\u2019s authority over such temporary storage to the \nphysical site of an operating, or formerly operating, re-\nactor. \nConsistent with its statutory mandate, when the \nNRC determined to formalize its procedures regarding \naway-from-reactor storage of spent nuclear fuel in \n1978, it did so in the most public, deliberate, and trans-\nparent way possible\u2014with extensive notice and com-\nment rulemaking, explicitly citing the above-noted \nAEA statutory provisions as its authority for doing so.  \nThe public record and comments covered almost every \nconceivable issue, including policy debates regarding \n\u201cat-reactor versus away-from-reactor siting\u201d of storage \ninstallations (45 Fed. Reg. at 74,696 (cleaned up)), but \nthere was no suggestion regarding any lack of NRC au-\nthority over the latter under the AEA.  Those regula-\ntions were promulgated in 1980, and have been on the \nbooks at 10 C.F.R. Part 72 and applied as needed, both \nprior to the passage of the NWPA in 1982 and for the \nmore than four decades since.  There are at least a \ndozen existing sites in the country where there is no \noperating reactor and where spent nuclear fuel is \nstored, at least seven of which are privately owned and \nlicensed pursuant to the same statutory and regula-\ntory authority as the proposed project in this case.  See \n\n33 \nU.S. Independent Spent Fuel Storage Installations \n(ISFSI), NRC (June 2023), https://www.nrc.gov/docs/\nML2316/ML23165A245.pdf (Current U.S. Independ-\nent Spent Fuel Storage Installation (ISFSI) Map as of \nJune 12, 2023 (nrc.gov)). \nThe D.C. and Tenth Circuits have consistently af-\nfirmed this reading of the AEA.  In the Bullcreek pro-\nceedings, both at the agency level and before the court \nof appeals, the vigorously contested issues were all \nabout whether the NRC\u2019s existing authority under the \nAEA to license away-from-reactor storage of spent nu-\nclear fuel had been abrogated by the NWPA.  See In re \nPriv. Fuel Storage, L.L.C., CLI-02-29, 56 N.R.C. 390, \n395-396 (Dec. 18, 2002); Bullcreek, 359 F.3d at 539-\n540; see also Skull Valley, 376 F.3d at 1232.  If there \nwas any legitimate doubt about the existence of the \nNRC\u2019s preexisting authority under the AEA in the first \nplace, such doubts would have been aired in those pro-\nceedings, rather than conceded.  Bullcreek, 359 F.3d at \n541.   \nIn Bullcreek, the D.C. Circuit did not say it was \n\u201cassuming without deciding\u201d the AEA\u2019s scope, which \nwould have been easy enough to do if that was truly \nwhat was going on.  That, however, was not what was \ngoing on\u2014the underlying AEA authority for the NRC \nwas the necessary predicate to the whole case.  More-\nover, any doubts that might have existed about the \ndepth or pedigree of the Bullcreek court\u2019s holdings re-\ngarding AEA authority were dispelled by the D.C. Cir-\ncuit\u2019s recent decision in Beyond Nuclear, Inc. v. NRC, \n113 F.4th 956 (D.C. Cir. 2024).  In Beyond Nuclear, \nwhich involved a private away-from-reactor spent fuel \nstorage project similar to the one in this case, the D.C. \n\n34 \nCircuit reaffirmed its rulings in unmistakable terms: \n\u201cIn Bullcreek, we explicitly held that the AEA provided \nthe \u2018NRC authority to license and regulate the storage \nand disposal of spent nuclear fuel,\u2019 and \u2018[p]ursuant to \nits AEA authority, the NRC promulgated regulations \n* * * for licensing onsite and away-from-reactor spent \nnuclear fuel storage facilities for private nuclear gen-\nerators.\u2019\u201d  Beyond Nuclear, 113 F.4th at 965 (quoting \nBullcreek, 359 F.3d at 538).  The court further held \nthat the NRC had \u201ceasily rejected\u201d the exact same AEA \nargument made by the respondents here, upon the au-\nthority of Bullcreek.  Beyond Nuclear, 113 F.4th at 965.   \nThe statutory text, the decades-old regulations, \nand the case law are all consistent: the AEA permits \nthe NRC to license private parties to temporarily store \nspent nuclear fuel away from the nuclear reactor that \ngenerated the fuel. \nB.\nThe Fifth Circuit and the Respond-\nents Misread the AEA. \nThat has been the settled law for decades, until the \nFifth Circuit\u2019s decision in this case.  None of the argu-\nments offered by the Fifth Circuit, or by respondents, \nwarrant a departure. \n1. \nWhile the Fifth Circuit did not come right out \nand say it, the court\u2019s main interpretative approach \nwas to apply a distorted type of ejusdem generis or \nnoscitur a sociis reasoning to the AEA\u2019s delegations of \nauthority.  That is, the Fifth Circuit looked at the \u201cre-\nsearch and development\u201d provisions of 42 U.S.C. \n2073(a)(1) and (2) for special nuclear material, and of \n42 U.S.C. 2093(a)(1) and (2) for source material, and \ninferred that possession licenses for those materials \n\n35 \nmay only be issued by the NRC for \u201ccertain types of \nresearch and development.\u201d  ISP Pet. App. 22a. \nThat conclusion is wrong for many reasons.  First, \neven if it were proper to apply an ejusdem generis-type \ncanon of interpretation here (and it was not, as ex-\nplained below), the Fifth Circuit inexplicably failed to \nconsider 42 U.S.C. 2073(a)(3) and 2093(a)(3), which \nauthorize \u201cfacilities\u201d licenses for power and isotope \nproduction plants and have nothing to do with \u201cre-\nsearch and development.\u201d  One cannot just ignore por-\ntions of the surrounding statute that do not fit the de-\nsired result.   \nSecond, application of ejusdem generis, as this \nCourt recently held, requires a \u201clong and detailed list \nof specific directions,\u201d with a common \u201clink.\u201d  Harring-\nton v. Purdue Pharma, L.P., 144 S. Ct. 2071, 2082 \n(2024), neither of which are present here.  There is no \n\u201clong list,\u201d but, rather, just four distinct enumerations \nof possible licensing purposes, with the last one being \nan express assignment of broad responsibility to the \nagency.  Indeed, and tellingly, in opposing certiorari, \nFasken rejected the \u201cresearch and development\u201d com-\nmonality proffered by the Fifth Circuit, in favor of a \nnewly minted \u201cactive, productive use\u201d construct, which \nwas never argued below nor embraced by the Fifth Cir-\ncuit.  Fasken Br. in Opp. 14.  Such disagreements \nabout the required commonality among those asserting \nand trying to defend the result are proof positive that \nthere is no true \u201ccommon attribute,\u201d and that the \nejusdem generis canon therefore does not apply.  E.g., \nAli v. Fed. Bureau of Prisons, 552 U.S. 214, 225 (2008); \nSw. Airlines Co. v. Saxon, 596 U.S. 450, 462 (2022). \n\n36 \nThird, the Fifth Circuit read critically important \nsections of the statutes, i.e., 42 U.S.C. 2073(a)(4) and \n2093(a)(4), as meaningless, i.e., as adding nothing to \nthe \u201cresearch and development\u201d provisions.  Subsec-\ntions (a)(4) of the statutes are not mere catchall provi-\nsions, but, rather, significant terms that expressly en-\nsure that the agency can fully implement the congres-\nsionally defined purposes of the AEA.  Doctrines such \nas noscitur a sociis may not be applied to give a statu-\ntory term \u201cthe same function as other words in the def-\ninition, thereby denying it independent meaning.\u201d \nBabbitt v. Sweet Home Chapter of Communities for a \nGreat Or., 515 U.S. 687, 702 (1995).  And, courts \nshould refrain from \u201cinterpreting any statutory provi-\nsion in a manner that would render another provision \nsuperfluous.\u201d  Bilski v. Kappos, 561 U.S. 593, 596, 607-\n608 (2010), (citing Corley v. United States, 556 U.S. \n303, 314 (2009)).  The Fifth Circuit violated those ele-\nmental principles, and its decision should be reversed. \n2.  The Fifth Circuit\u2019s only treatment of Sections \n2073(a)(3) and 2093(a)(3) was to set up, and then re-\nject, a strawman.  Those sections refer to 42 U.S.C. \n2133, which authorize so-called \u201cfacilities\u201d licenses for \n\u201cutilization facilities,\u201d which are power plants (42 \nU.S.C. 2014(cc)), and \u201cproduction facilities,\u201d which are \nisotope production facilities (42 U.S.C. 2014(v)).  Be-\ncause those are defined terms that the Fifth Circuit \nviewed as not encompassing \u201cstorage or disposal,\u201d the \nFifth Circuit held that they do not authorize the pro-\nject at issue.  ISP App. 23a.  But no one ever argued \nthat they did.  The argument, instead, was that other \naspects of the agency\u2019s delegated powers furnish the \nnecessary authority.  And if the Fifth Circuit\u2019s reading \nwere correct, a seemingly necessary implication would \n\n37 \nbe that the AEA does not authorize the NRC to license \n\u201cstorage\u201d of spent nuclear fuel\u2014by anyone, anywhere, \never.  In opposing certiorari, Texas ran with that view, \nTexas Br. in Opp. 22, but then, perhaps recognizing \nthat that simply could not be correct, postulated that \n\u201ccommon sense\u201d (as opposed to anything in the stat-\nute) must mean that nuclear utilities are allowed to \nstore fuel at the site of an operating reactor.  Texas Br. \nin Opp. 30.  The contortions one must make to defend \nthe Fifth Circuit\u2019s outcome reveals its error. \n3.  Another strawman invoked by the Fifth Cir-\ncuit involved 42 U.S.C. 2011, which relates to byprod-\nuct materials.  The Fifth Circuit focused on 42 U.S.C. \n2111(b), which addresses \u201cdisposal\u201d of certain types of \n\u201cbyproduct\u201d materials.  ISP Pet. App. 23a.  The license \nat issue here, however, has nothing to do with \u201cdis-\nposal,\u201d but instead involves temporary \u201cpossession\u201d of \nspent nuclear fuel until it is permanently disposed of.  \nThe relevant \u201cbyproduct\u201d provision is therefore Section \n2111(a)\u2014not Section 2111(b), which no one ever in-\nvoked to authorize the license at issue.  The Fifth Cir-\ncuit then did its own web-based research about half-\nlives of certain radioactive isotopes, opining that the \nhalf-life of radium-226 is far less than that of pluto-\nnium, and, since spent nuclear fuel contains pluto-\nnium, Section 2111(b) could not apply or authorize the \nlicense.  ISP Pet. App. 23-24a.  But, again, no one ever \nargued that it did, and plutonium is not even \u201cbyprod-\nuct\u201d material.  Rather, it is \u201cspecial nuclear material.\u201d  \n42 U.S.C. 2014(aa).  The Fifth Circuit\u2019s reliance on \nSection 2111(b) for its conclusions is therefore doubly \nmisguided.   \n\n38 \n4.  At bottom, the Fifth Circuit and the respond-\nents impermissibly seek to insert a substantive mate-\nrial term that they may now wish was in the AEA, but \nwhich is not\u2014namely, a geographic \u201cat-reactor\u201d limi-\ntation on possession and storage of spent nuclear fuel.  \nCourts, however, may not rewrite statutes to insert \nterms that are not there.  E.g., Borden v. United States, \n593 U.S. 420, 436 (2021) (\u201cOnce again, statutory con-\nstruction does not work that way:  A court does not get \nto delete inconvenient language and insert convenient \nlanguage to yield the court\u2019s preferred meaning.\u201d); Ro-\nmag Fasteners, Inc. v. Fossil, Inc., 590 U.S. 212, 215 \n(2020) (\u201cNor does this Court usually read into statutes \nwords that aren\u2019t there.\u201d).   \n5.  The last important point about the AEA con-\ncerns the Fifth Circuit\u2019s reliance on West Virginia v. \nEPA, 597 U.S. 697 (2022).  ISP Pet. App. 30-31a; see \nalso Fasken Br. in Opp. 15-17; Texas Br. in Opp. 32.  \nWhatever the post-Loper Bright import of West Vir-\nginia might be, the \u201cmajor questions\u201d doctrine has no \nbearing here.  In all the ways that matter, this case \npresents circumstances that are the complete opposite\nof those that led this Court to give heightened scrutiny \nto agency action in West Virginia.  This is not a case \nwhere an agency strayed outside its lane\u2014safety-\nbased regulation of nuclear materials, which has al-\nways been the agency\u2019s core function under the AEA, \ne.g., 42 U.S.C. 2011(b), 2201(b).  The license and appli-\ncable regulations here plainly serve just that purpose.  \nHere, there was nothing \u201cunprecedented\u201d nor any way \nthat \u201cthings changed\u201d when the NRC exercised its dec-\nades-old, completely transparent licensing authority \nfor these materials.  West Virginia, 597 U.S. at 711.  \nCongress had not \u201cconsidered and rejected\u201d the \n\n39 \nexercise of that challenged authority.  Id. at 731.  And \nit is emphatically not true that the NRC has \u201cnever \nregulated\u201d in the way now being challenged.  Id. at \n729-731.  The NRC should be allowed to keep doing \nwhat it has lawfully been doing under the AEA for \nnearly half a century, and West Virginia is not at all to \nthe contrary. \nIV.\nThe Nuclear Waste Policy Act Does Not \nProhibit the NRC from Licensing Private \nParties to Temporarily Store Spent Nu-\nclear Fuel Away from the Nuclear Reactor \nThat Generated the Spent Nuclear Fuel.  \nIn holding that the NWPA \u201cdoesn\u2019t permit\u201d private \naway-from-reactor storage of spent nuclear fuel, the \nFifth Circuit abandoned any pretense of relying on \nstatutory text.  ISP Pet. App. 30a.  Rather, the court \ninvoked characterizations of alleged \u201cCongressional \npolicy,\u201d \u201chistorical context,\u201d and the overall \u201cstatutory \nscheme.\u201d  ISP Pet. App. 21a, 29a, 30a.  It had no other \nchoice: the NWPA contains no text whatsoever that ex-\npressly or impliedly prohibits the NRC from licensing \na private party to possess spent nuclear fuel at an \naway-from-reactor site.  In all the briefing in these \nmatters to date, neither respondents nor the Fifth Cir-\ncuit ever identified any such term, because one does \nnot exist. \nThe Fifth Circuit also misconstrued the structure \nand text of the portions of the NWPA that it did cite.  \nFor example, the Fifth Circuit erroneously invoked a \npart of the NWPA that describes at-reactor storage at \nPart B-Interim Storage Program, 42 U.S.C. 10151-\n10157, as a purported limitation on the NRC (ISP App. \n28a-29a), without appreciating that the actual role of \n\n40 \nthose provisions was merely to delineate \u201cprecondi-\ntions on private generators for obtaining federal in-\nterim storage.\u201d Bullcreek, 359 F.3d at 542.  Similarly, \nthe \u201cmonitored retrievable storage\u201d provisions at 42 \nU.S.C. 10161-10169, by their terms, relate to storage \nof spent nuclear fuel by DOE, not by private parties.  \n(Neither of those programs ultimately came to pass, \nbut the statutory provisions did nothing to call into \nquestion the NRC\u2019s pre-existing authority under the \nAEA.)  Section 10155(h), which the Fifth Circuit cited \nin a footnote (ISP Pet. App. 28a n.4), states that \u201cnoth-\ning in this chapter shall be construed to encourage, au-\nthorize, or require the private or Federal use, pur-\nchase, lease, or other acquisition of any storage facility \nlocated away from the site of any civilian nuclear \npower reactor and not owned by the Federal Govern-\nment on\u201d the date of enactment.  That provision, how-\never, merely limits the scope of the NWPA\u2014it \u201cis fa-\ncially neutral: neither prohibiting nor promoting the \nuse of private [away-from-reactor] storage facilities.\u201d  \nBullcreek, 359 F.3d at 542 (cleaned up).  Properly con-\nstrued, \u201cnothing in the text of \u00a7 10155(h) suggests that \nCongress intended to repeal\u201d the NRC\u2019s authority to \nlicense private away-from-reactor storage under the \nAEA.  Bullcreek, 359 F.3d at 542. \nThe context of the NWPA\u2019s enactment confirms \nthe Fifth Circuit\u2019s error.  The regulations at 10 C.F.R. \nPart 72 had long been on the books when the NWPA \nwas being debated and enacted, and the NRC\u2019s asser-\ntion of authority to license private away-from-reactor \nstorage under the AEA was well known to Congress.  \nSee S. REP. NO. 97-282, at 44 (1981); Bullcreek, 359 \nF.3d at 542 (\u201cCongress was aware of the NRC\u2019s regu-\nlations for licensing private away-from-reactor storage \n\n41 \nfacilities\u201d).  Congress, of course, \u201clegislates against the \nbackdrop of existing law,\u201d Parker Drilling Mgmt. \nServs., Ltd. v. Newton, 587 U.S. 601, 611 (2019) (cita-\ntion omitted).  And here, that existing law included the \nAEA delegations discussed above, which the NRC \nopenly construed as permitting the type of licensing \nbeing challenged here.  It is a \u201ccardinal rule\u201d that a \nrevocation of the NRC\u2019s preexisting statutory author-\nity should not be implied from a subsequent law.  Mor-\nton v. Mancari, 417 U.S. 535, 549-551 (1974).  Had \nCongress wanted to limit this licensing authority, it \nwould have done so explicitly. \nAnd, once again, the case law of other circuits is \nconsistent, persuasive, and directly contrary to the \nNWPA holding of the Fifth Circuit here.  The NWPA \narguments by the petitioners in Bullcreek and the re-\nspondents in this case (adopted by the Fifth Circuit) \nare almost verbatim:  Compare Bullcreek, 359 F.3d at \n539 (\u201cCongress had established in the NWPA a \u2018com-\nprehensive national nuclear waste management sys-\ntem for the storage of [spent nuclear fuel],\u2019\u201d that pro-\nhibited the NRC from licensing private away-from-re-\nactor storage of spent nuclear fuel (quoting petition)) \nwith ISP Pet. App. 29a (\u201ccomprehensive statutory \nscheme\u201d of the NWPA precludes the NRC from licens-\ning away-from-reactor storage of spent nuclear fuel).  \nIn response, and unlike the Fifth Circuit here, the \nBullcreek \ncourt \nthoroughly\u2014and \naccurately\u2014re-\nviewed the \u201clanguage,\u201d \u201cstructure,\u201d and \u201clegislative \nhistory\u201d of the NWPA, and rejected the claims.  Bull-\ncreek, 359 F.3d at 541-542.  Every other circuit court \nthat has addressed the issue has reached the same re-\nsult.  Skull Valley, 376 F.3d at 1232-1233; Balderas, \n\n42 \n59 F.4th at 1115, 1121; Beyond Nuclear, 113 F.4th at \n965. \nIn sum: the NWPA created acceptance and dis-\nposal obligations on the part of DOE, not the NRC.  \nThe NWPA was all about permanent disposal of spent \nnuclear fuel by DOE, not temporary possession of spent \nnuclear fuel by private parties.  E.g., Don\u2019t Waste \nMich., 2023 WL 395030, at *1 (\u201cStorage and disposal, \nhowever, are different concepts.\u201d); Balderas, 59 F.4th \nat 1115, 1121 (NWPA \u201cgoverns the establishment of a \nfederal repository for permanent storage [i.e., dis-\nposal], not temporary storage by private parties.\u201d).  As \nthe other circuits have held, at the end of the day the \nNWPA has nothing to do with the issues in this case.  \nThe Fifth Circuit erred in splitting with those circuits \nand concluding otherwise. \n\n43 \nCONCLUSION \nThe judgment of the Fifth Circuit should be re-\nversed, and this Court should direct the Fifth Circuit \nto dismiss or deny the petitions. \nRespectfully submitted, \nBRAD FAGG\n Counsel of Record \nTIMOTHY P.

I now recognize that predicting the outcome requires analyzing two distinct legal issues:\n1.  **A procedural question:** Whether a nonparty has standing to challenge an agency order under the Hobbs Act. This will likely involve statutory interpretation of that specific act and precedents on judicial review and standing.\n2.  **A substantive question:** Whether the NRC has the statutory authority under the Atomic Energy Act and/or the Nuclear Waste Policy Act to license private, off-site interim storage facilities. This will involve deep statutory analysis and arguments about congressional intent and agency power.\n\nMy uncertainty about the ultimate outcome remains maximal, as I have not yet reviewed any legal arguments.

          "task_beliefs": "My initial understanding was based on the case summary, which identified the two central legal questions: one procedural (Hobbs Act standing) and one substantive (NRC's statutory authority). I knew I needed to uncover the specific legal arguments each side would present.\n\nThis observation, the petitioner's brief from Interim Storage Partners (ISP), has provided the first layer of specific legal argumentation, significantly reducing my uncertainty about the petitioner's position.\n\n1.  **Procedural Question (Hobbs Act):** I now understand the petitioner's specific line of attack. They argue that the Fifth Circuit improperly created a \"judge-made 'ultra vires exception'\" to the Hobbs Act's clear statutory requirement that only a \"party aggrieved\" can seek judicial review (28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2344). ISP's argument is that because Texas and the other respondents did not participate in the formal NRC agency proceedings, they do not qualify as a \"party\" and therefore lack standing to sue in the court of appeals. The Fifth Circuit's decision to hear the case anyway, based on the allegation that the NRC acted beyond its power (*ultra vires*), is framed as a judicial overreach that ignores a clear congressional limit on jurisdiction.\n\n2.  **Substantive Question (NRC Authority):** I have learned the two-pronged statutory argument ISP will make:\n    *   **The Atomic Energy Act (AEA) Grants Authority:** ISP argues that the AEA provides broad and explicit authority for the NRC to license the possession of nuclear materials to protect public health and safety (citing 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2201(b)) and to promote the peaceful development of atomic energy. They contend that licensing temporary, away-from-reactor storage falls squarely within this long-standing authority. The brief highlights that the NRC and its predecessor have been licensing such activities for decades, citing regulations like 10 C.F.R. pt. 72, which have been on the books since 1980.\n    *   **The Nuclear Waste Policy Act (NWPA) Does Not Revoke Authority:** ISP frames the NWPA not as a source of authority, but as a law that does *not* prohibit or repeal the NRC's pre-existing authority under the AEA. Their argument is that the NWPA, which addresses the federal government's responsibility for a *permanent* repository (Yucca Mountain), does not speak to, and therefore does not limit, the NRC's power to license *private, temporary* storage solutions. This is a classic argument against implied repeal.\n\n3.  **Case Framing and Key Precedents:** The petitioner's brief frames the Fifth Circuit's decision as a dangerous and destabilizing anomaly that threatens a critical national industry. It contrasts the Fifth Circuit's ruling with decisions from other circuits (e.g., D.C. Circuit in *Bullcreek v. NRC*, Tenth Circuit in *Skull Valley Band of Goshute Indians v. Nielson*) that have upheld the NRC's authority in similar contexts. This signals that a \"circuit split\" argument will be central to their case. The extensive Table of Authorities provides a roadmap to the key cases and statutes that will be the focus of the Court's debate.\n\nMy model of the case has evolved from a simple statement of the questions to a structured understanding of one side's complete argumentative framework. My next priority is to acquire the respondent's (Texas's) brief to understand the counterarguments on both the procedural and substantive points.",
          "design_beliefs": "My initial design belief was that a high-value first step in analyzing a SCOTUS case is to read the petitioner's brief, particularly one from the Solicitor General, to frame the conflict.\n\nThis observation strongly validates and refines that core heuristic.\n\n1.  **Validated Heuristic: Primacy of the Petitioner's Brief.** The action of retrieving and analyzing the petitioner's brief was extremely effective. It provided a massive information gain, transforming my understanding from a high-level summary to a detailed map of the legal arguments, statutory interpretations, and key precedents for one side. This confirms that prioritizing this primary source document is a highly efficient strategy for reducing uncertainty.\n\n2.  **Refined Heuristic: Source Generalization.** My initial focus was on the Solicitor General's brief. This observation provided the brief from a private petitioner, Interim Storage Partners, LLC. The quality and depth of the legal analysis are still exceptionally high. This refines my belief: **any petitioner's merits brief is a critical starting point.** The party seeking to overturn a lower court decision bears the burden of argument, making their brief the natural document for framing the entire case, regardless of whether they are a government or private entity.\n\n3.  **New Heuristic: Efficient Information Extraction from Briefs.** This observation taught me *how* to read a legal brief efficiently for initial analysis. The most information-dense sections for building a structural model of the case are, in order:\n    *   **Table of Contents / Summary of Argument:** This provides a complete, high-level outline of the entire legal argument. It is the fastest way to grasp the logical flow and key points.\n    *   **Introduction:** This reveals the narrative framing, policy considerations, and emotional tenor of the argument.\n    *   **Table of Authorities:** This serves as a bibliography of the legal battleground, identifying the specific statutes and case law that will be contested.\n    By focusing on these sections first, I can rapidly build a robust model of a party's position before needing to delve into the full text of the argument. This is a powerful and generalizable approach for future cases.\n\nMy methodology has thus evolved from \"start by reading the petitioner's brief\" to a more sophisticated process: **\"Initiate analysis by retrieving the petitioner's merits brief. Extract the core argumentative structure by analyzing the Table of Contents, Introduction, and Table of Authorities to build a preliminary model of the legal conflict.\"**"

For various reasons\u2014mostly politi-\ncal, some practical\u2014construction of that facility has \nstalled and now is all but \u201cdead.\u201d Nico Portuondo, The \nReturn of Yucca Mountain? GOP Floats Waste Site\u2019s \nRevival, \nE&E \nNEWS \n(Apr. \n11, \n2024), \nhttps://perma.cc/ZS52-ZC4K. \u201cBy law,\u201d however, \u201cYucca \nMountain is still the government\u2019s official plan to deal \nwith the more than 85,000 metric tons of spent nuclear \nfuel that has piled up at more than 100 locations across \nthe country.\u201d Id.; see also 42 U.S.C. \u00a710172(a)(1).  \nAfter ignoring its statutory duties for decades, in re-\ncent years, the federal government has begun focusing \non what it claims is a policy workaround: so-called \u201cin-\nterim storage projects.\u201d Portuondo, supra. Rather than \nplacing spent fuel in a facility dedicated to permanent \n(and safe) disposal, private facilities away from reactors \nwill store waste on a nominally temporary basis. Con-\ngress, however, has never authorized such a scheme. In \nany event, how can storage be temporary if there is little \nprospect of \u201can eventual permanent repository\u201d? Id. \nHere, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission purports \nto allow a private entity to store thousands of tons of \nspent nuclear fuel above Texas\u2019s Permian Basin\u2014the \nworld\u2019s most productive oil field and the only source of \nsafe water for hundreds of miles. Although the Commis-\nsion describes this scheme as an \u201cinterim\u201d measure, the \nlicense has a forty-year term, is renewable, and is unac-\ncompanied by any plan to transfer the waste to a nonex-\ni\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n12: 20250115145446032_23-130020and2023-1312_CERT20OF20COMPLIANCE.json (score: 0.354)\nSUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES \nNo. 23-1300, 23-1312 \n ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------X \nUNITED STATES NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION, ET AL., \n \nPetitioners, \nv. \n \nSTATE OF TEXAS, ET AL., \n \n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ \nINTERIM STORAGE PARTNERS, LLC, \n \nPetitioner, \nv. \n \nSTATE OF TEXAS, ET AL., \n \n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------X \nCERTIFICATE OF COMPLIANCE \nAs \nrequired \nby \nSupreme \nCourt \nRule \n33.1(h),  \nI certify that the document contains 12,944 words, excluding \nthe parts of the document that are exempted by Supreme Court \nRule 33.1(d). \nI declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true \nand correct.  \nExecuted on January 15, 2025 \n_________________________ \nCandice Best \nSworn to and subscribed before me  \nthis 15th day of January, 2025 \n \n_______________________________ \nMARIANA BRAYLOVSKIY \nNotary Public State of New York \nNo. 01BR6004935 \nQualified in Richmond County \nCommission Expires March 30, 2026 \n#333422\n\n",

The questions presented are: \n \n1. Whether the State whose very land, water, and air \nstand to be polluted by spent nuclear fuel may challenge \na license\u2014issued over its objection\u2014to store that fuel ei-\nther as a \u201cparty aggrieved\u201d under, or in accord with an \nultra vires exception to, the Administrative Orders Re-\nview Act, commonly called the Hobbs Act. 28 U.S.C. \n\u00a72344. \n \n2. Whether the Atomic Energy Act and the Nuclear \nWaste Policy Act, which never mention temporary \naway-from-reactor storage of spent nuclear fuel by pri-\nvate parties, nonetheless authorize the Commission to li-\ncense such a facility, notwithstanding Congress\u2019s ex-\npress command that the nation\u2019s spent fuel should be \npermanently disposed of in Yucca Mountain, Nevada. \n \n \n \n \n\n \n(II) \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nPage \n \nQuestions Presented .........................................................

For various reasons\u2014mostly politi-\ncal, some practical\u2014construction of that facility has \nstalled and now is all but \u201cdead.\u201d Nico Portuondo, The \nReturn of Yucca Mountain? GOP Floats Waste Site\u2019s \nRevival, \nE&E \nNEWS \n(Apr. \n11, \n2024), \nhttps://perma.cc/ZS52-ZC4K. \u201cBy law,\u201d however, \u201cYucca \nMountain is still the government\u2019s official plan to deal \nwith the more than 85,000 metric tons of spent nuclear \nfuel that has piled up at more than 100 locations across \nthe country.\u201d Id.; see also 42 U.S.C. \u00a710172(a)(1).  \nAfter ignoring its statutory duties for decades, in re-\ncent years, the federal government has begun focusing \non what it claims is a policy workaround: so-called \u201cin-\nterim storage projects.\u201d Portuondo, supra. Rather than \nplacing spent fuel in a facility dedicated to permanent \n(and safe) disposal, private facilities away from reactors \nwill store waste on a nominally temporary basis. Con-\ngress, however, has never authorized such a scheme. In \nany event, how can storage be temporary if there is little \nprospect of \u201can eventual permanent repository\u201d? Id. \nHere, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission purports \nto allow a private entity to store thousands of tons of \nspent nuclear fuel above Texas\u2019s Permian Basin\u2014the \nworld\u2019s most productive oil field and the only source of \nsafe water for hundreds of miles. Although the Commis-\nsion describes this scheme as an \u201cinterim\u201d measure, the \nlicense has a forty-year term, is renewable, and is unac-\ncompanied by any plan to transfer the waste to a nonex-\nistent permanent repository. \n\n2 \n \nNothing about this license is lawful. Congress has al-\nready legislated a solution to the nation\u2019s nuclear-waste \nproblem: permanent storage in Yucca Mountain. No \nstatute mentions, let alone authorizes, private interim \noffsite storage. Instead, the only interim storage Con-\ngress has permitted is in federal facilities, and only un-\nder defined circumstances. Because the Commission has \ncreated its own plan \u201cwithout any legal basis,\u201d In re Ai-\nken County, 725 F.3d 255, 266 (D.C. Cir. 2013), its actions \ncannot stand.  \nNonetheless, the Commission and its licensee con-\ntend that Texas and local landowners may not challenge \nthis unlawfulness, even arguing that an agency\u2019s rules \ncan limit a federal court\u2019s jurisdiction. This position con-\ntravenes statutory language and creates a morass of line-\ndrawing problems. Regardless, \u201c[n]onstatutory review \nof federal agency action is available\u201d where, as here, \u201can \nagency action is ultra vires.\u201d Jared P. Cole, An Intro-\nduction to Judicial Review of Federal Agency Action at \n3 n.33, CONG\u2019L RSCH. SERV. (Dec. 7, 2016).   \nSTATEMENT \nI. Statutory and Regulatory Background \nA. Enacted in 1954, the Atomic Energy Act (AEA) \ngranted authority over certain aspects of nuclear power. \nCongress has since redistributed that authority to the \nNuclear Regulatory Commission and the Department of \nEnergy. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a72011 et seq.; see id. \u00a75842. The Com-\nmission has \u201cjurisdiction over nuclear plant licensing and \nregulation,\u201d while the Department is primarily charged \nwith \u201cenergy research and development.\u201d County of \nRockland v. NRC, 709 F.2d 766, 769 n.2 (2d Cir. 1983). \nAs the nuclear-energy market boomed following the \nAEA\u2019s enactment, nuclear waste from spent nuclear fuel \npiled up. \u201cPrior to the late 1970\u2019s,\u201d however, that was \n\n3 \n \nunconcerning. Idaho v. DOE, 945 F.2d 295, 298-99 (9th \nCir. 1991). Because \u201cit was accepted that spent fuel \nwould be reprocessed,\u201d id., power plants built capacity \nonsite to store spent fuel briefly before reprocessing. \nBut in the \u201cmid-70\u2019s,\u201d the reprocessing concept \u201ccol-\nlapsed.\u201d Idaho, 945 F.2d at 298-99. The nation thus had \nnowhere to place a growing stockpile of material that re-\nmains radioactive \u201cfor time spans seemingly beyond hu-\nman comprehension.\u201d New York v. NRC, 681 F.3d 471, \n474 (D.C. Cir. 2012). Although acknowledging that onsite \nstorage facilities could be expanded with \u201cnegligible\u201d en-\nvironmental impacts, NRC, NUREG-0404, Generic En-\nvironmental Impact Statement on Handling and Stor-\nage of Spent Light Water Power Reactor Fuel at ES-5 \n(Mar. 1978), the Commission proposed \u201cinstallations \nbuilt specifically\u201d for long-term storage \u201cthat are not \ncoupled to either a nuclear power plant or a fuel repro-\ncessing plant,\u201d NRC, Proposed Rule, Storage of Spent \nFuel in an Independent Fuel Spent Storage Installa-\ntion, 43 Fed. Reg. 46,309, 46,309 (Oct. 6, 1978). \nDespite a lack of legal authority, the Commission \nplowed ahead. See, e.g., NRC, Final Rule, Licensing Re-\nquirements for the Storage of Spent Fuel in an Inde-\npendent Spent Fuel Storage Installation, 45 Fed. Reg. \n74,693 (Nov. 12, 1980). This development prompted \nalarm. Some commenters warned of the significant \n\u201ctransportation risks\u201d associated with moving nuclear \nwaste. Id. at 74,696. Others \u201cexpressed a concern that \nthe promulgation of a rule covering\u201d this issue \u201cwould \ndecrease pressures on both industry and government to \nsolve the radioactive waste problem.\u201d Id. at 74,693.  \nB. In 1982, Congress enacted the Nuclear Waste \nPolicy Act (NWPA) to resolve this \u201cnational problem\u201d \nand \u201cmajor subject[] of public concern\u201d for which \n\n4 \n \n\u201c[f]ederal efforts\u201d had thus far \u201cnot been adequate.\u201d \n42 U.S.C. \u00a710131(a)(2)-(3), (7). Finding that \u201cState and \npublic participation in the planning and development of \nrepositories is essential in order to promote public confi-\ndence,\u201d id. \u00a710131(a)(6), the NWPA tasked the Depart-\nment with establishing a permanent repository to place \nthe nation\u2019s spent nuclear fuel deep underground, id. \n\u00a710132. And it made the Commission responsible for li-\ncensing that repository. Id. \u00a710134. In 1987, Congress \namended the NWPA to specify Yucca Mountain, id. \n\u00a710172(a), as the site for the first repository, id. \u00a710134, \nwhich was to begin operations no later than January 31, \n1998, id. \u00a710222(a)(5)(B). \nThe NWPA also directed how spent fuel should be \nstored in the interim. Specifically, should onsite storage \nprove inadequate, Congress permitted storage of spent \nfuel (1) temporarily at a federal facility to avoid a com-\nmercial reactor\u2019s shutdown, id. \u00a7\u00a710151-57; or (2) tempo-\nrarily at a federal facility for so-called \u201cmonitored re-\ntrievable storage,\u201d id. \u00a7\u00a710161-69.  \nC. Although the NWPA \u201cis obviously designed to \nprevent the Department from delaying the construction \nof Yucca Mountain as the permanent facility while using \ntemporary facilities,\u201d NARUC v. DOE, 736 F.3d 517, 519 \n(D.C. Cir. 2013), delay ensued. \u201c[B]y the mid-1990s, the \nDepartment of Energy made clear that it could not meet \nthe 1998 deadline\u201d; it did not submit a license application \nfor Yucca Mountain until 2008, Texas v. United States, \n891 F.3d 553, 555-56 (5th Cir. 2018). Then, \u201cby its own \nadmission,\u201d the Commission refused to \u201ccomply[] with \nthe law\u201d requiring it to evaluate that application, \nprompting the D.C. Circuit to issue a writ of mandamus. \nAiken, 725 F.3d at 258.  \n\n5 \n \nBut even that order did not prevent agency intransi-\ngence. Texas, 891 F.3d at 557. Instead, the Commission \nturned to \u201cinterim\u201d facilities, which it hoped would gar-\nner local support. Portuondo, supra. Yet interim storage \nfaces at least three obstacles: (1) Many local communities \ndo not support it; (2) storage is hardly \u201cinterim\u201d where \nthere are no efforts to build a permanent repository; and \n(3) most fundamentally, the statutory directive that \nspent nuclear fuel be stored in Yucca Mountain remains \nin effect. Id. \nII. ISP\u2019s \nApplication \nand \nLicense \nfor \na \n\u201cConsolidated Interim Storage Facility\u201d  \nIn 2016, Interim Storage Partners\u2019 (ISP\u2019s) predeces-\nsor applied for a license to operate a \u201cconsolidated in-\nterim storage facility\u201d where it could house thousands of \nmetric tons of spent nuclear fuel in dry-cask, \nabove-ground storage in Andrews County, Texas, less \nthan a mile from the Texas\u2013New Mexico border. The li-\ncense would be valid for forty years, but ISP may seek to \nrenew it for an additional twenty. J.A.205-06.  \nTexas strenuously objected. On Texas\u2019s behalf, Gov-\nernor Greg Abbott submitted comments explaining why \nspent fuel is too \u201cdangerous\u201d to be placed anywhere \nother than in \u201ca deep geologic repository\u201d and definitely \nshould not be stored on \u201ca concrete pad\u201d atop an oil field \nwhere 250,000 active oil and gas wells capture 40% of \nAmerica\u2019s oil reserves. J.A.117-18. If something were to \nhappen\u2014be it terrorism or an accident\u2014the result \nwould devastate the world\u2019s largest producing oil field \nand would significantly harm \u201cthe entire country.\u201d \nJ.A.122.  \nThe Texas Commission on Environmental Quality \n(TCEQ) warned that because the Commission has disre-\ngarded Yucca Mountain, ISP\u2019s facility could \u201cbecome the \n\n6 \n \npermanent solution\u201d for the nation\u2019s nuclear waste. \nJ.A.206. Although the Commission says that it \u201cexpects\u201d \nthat the waste will eventually be \u201cshipped to a permanent \ngeologic repository,\u201d J.A.206, the Commission never ad-\ndressed what would happen if\u2014as has been the case for \ndecades\u2014no permanent facility eventuates, J.A.207. \nNew Mexico\u2019s Governor raised similar concerns, warn-\ning of \u201csignificant risk\u201d that the nation\u2019s spent nuclear \nfuel will stay in Texas forever. J.A.212. Nevertheless, the \nCommission licensed ISP\u2019s proposed facility in 2021. \nPet.App.53a. \nIII. Proceedings in the Court of Appeals \nTexas, Governor Abbott, and TCEQ (collectively, \n\u201cTexas\u201d) petitioned for review in the Fifth Circuit, ISP \nintervened, and the Fifth Circuit made two rulings rele-\nvant here. \nFirst, although Texas did not intervene before the \nagency by seeking a hearing, the State fits within the \u201cul-\ntra vires exception to the [Hobbs Act\u2019s] party-aggrieved \nstatus requirement.\u201d Pet.App.18a-20a; see also, e.g., \nLeedom v. Kyne, 358 U.S. 184, 188-89 (1958) (recognizing \nultra vires review). Alternatively, the Fifth Circuit sug-\ngested that Texas would be a \u201cparty aggrieved\u201d under \nthe Hobbs Act because it \u201cparticipated\u2014in some way\u2014\nin the agency proceedings,\u201d namely by submitting com-\nments, Pet.App.17a-18a.     \nSecond, the Fifth Circuit held that \u201c[w]hat to do with \nthe nation\u2019s ever-growing accumulation of nuclear waste \nis a major question that\u2014as the history of the Yucca \nMountain repository shows\u2014has been hotly politically \ncontested for over half a century.\u201d Pet.App.29a-30a; see \nalso 42 U.S.C. \u00a710131(a)(7). The Commission accordingly \nneeds clear authorization to license private offsite stor-\nage facilities. Pet.App.30a. Yet the AEA does not \n\n7 \n \ndelegate such authority, and the NWPA affirmatively \n\u201cbelies the Commission\u2019s arguments.\u201d Pet.App.31a. \nIn reaching this conclusion, the Fifth Circuit rejected \nthe Commission\u2019s assertion that because it may license \nthe possession of other nuclear materials, it \u201chas broad \nauthority to license storage facilities for spent nuclear \nfuel.\u201d Pet.App.22a. After all, the Commission may license \npossession of specified materials \u201conly for certain enu-\nmerated purposes\u2014none of which encompass storage or \ndisposal of material as radioactive as spent nuclear fuel.\u201d \nPet.App.22a. The Commission\u2019s contrary argument, the \nFifth Circuit explained, \u201ccannot be reconciled with the \n[NWPA],\u201d Pet.App.26a, which \u201ccreates a comprehensive \nstatutory scheme for addressing spent nuclear fuel accu-\nmulation,\u201d Pet.App.29a.    \nThe Fifth Circuit declined to rehear the case en banc. \nPet.App.32a. Judge Higginson dissented and argued for \nthe elimination of that court\u2019s ultra vires exception. \nPet.App.45a-52a. In response, Judge Jones explained \nwhy the State would be a \u201cparty aggrieved\u201d regardless \nof any such exception. Pet.App.33a-44a. \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nWhat to do with the nation\u2019s spent nuclear fuel impli-\ncates a host of difficult technological, environmental, and \npolitical considerations. Thankfully, that \u201cpolicy debate \nis not\u201d this Court\u2019s \u201cconcern.\u201d Aiken, 725 F.3d at 257. \nBecause Congress has decided how to handle spent nu-\nclear fuel, all that matters is that Yucca Mountain is not \nin Texas and ISP is not the federal government. Petition-\ners\u2019 efforts to evade these foundational points fail.   \nI. Jurisdiction exists for two reasons. First, Texas is \na \u201cparty aggrieved\u201d under the Hobbs Act because it \nparticipated in agency proceeding by filing comments\u2014\nwhich is both the best reading of the statute and the only \n\n8 \n \nreading that makes sense given that the same provision \ngoverns challenges to adjudications and rulemakings. \nPetitioners have no good answer, instead insisting that \nthe Act is a chameleon, with the meaning of \u201cparty \naggrieved\u201d \ndepending \non \nwhether \nan \nagency \npromulgates a rule or issues an order, and that agencies \ncan create jurisdictional exhaustion requirements. Such \na strained reading flunks multiple canons of construction \nand is a recipe for confusion.    \nSecond, Texas can sue to challenge the Commission\u2019s \nacts as ultra vires. Although Petitioners make much of the \nfact that the Hobbs Act nowhere mentions ultra vires \nreview, courts have engaged in nonstatutory review for \ncenturies. If, contrary to reality, the Hobbs Act is \nunavailable here, ultra vires review applies. \nII. On the merits, Petitioners argue that Congress \nnever prohibited private interim, offsite storage \nfacilities. Because \u201can agency literally has no power to \nact \u2026 until Congress confers power upon it,\u201d La. Pub. \nServ. Comm\u2019n v. FCC, 476 U.S. 355, 374 (1986), however, \nthe question is not what Congress prohibited, but what \nCongress allowed. Petitioners have no good answer for \nthe fact that Congress repeatedly allowed offsite storage \nat a federal facility, not a private one. \nThis, moreover, \u201cis a major questions case,\u201d West \nVirginia v. EPA, 597 U.S. 697, 724 (2022), or, at mini-\nmum, a no-elephants-in-mouseholes case. Where an \n\u201cissue is one of deep economic and political significance,\u201d \nCongress must delegate clearly because \u201cextraordinary \ngrants of regulatory authority are rarely accomplished \nthrough modest words, vague terms, or subtle devices.\u201d \nLoper Bright Enters. v. Raimondo, 603 U.S. 369, 405 \n(2024) (citation omitted). Here, Congress recognized that \nwhere to house spent nuclear fuel is a \u201cnational problem\u201d \n\n9 \n \nand a \u201cmajor \u2026 public concern.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a710131(a)(2), \n(7). Congress answered that \u201cmajor\u201d question, id., both \nas to interim offsite storage, id. \u00a7\u00a710151-57, and \npermanent disposal, id. \u00a710172(a). Congress\u2019s clear \nanswer was Yucca Mountain or interim federal \nfacilities\u2014not a private facility in Texas.    \nARGUMENT \nI. Texas May Challenge ISP\u2019s Unlawful License.  \nUnder the Hobbs Act, a \u201cparty aggrieved\u201d by a final \norder may seek review in the court of appeals. 28 U.S.C. \n\u00a72344. Because ISP all but concedes (at 10) that Fasken \nis a party aggrieved, whether Texas is one too is aca-\ndemic. If the Court reaches this question, however, \nTexas properly sought review as a party aggrieved or be-\ncause the Commission acted ultra vires. \nA. Texas is a \u201cparty aggrieved.\u201d \n1. Texas is a \u201cparty aggrieved\u201d because it \nparticipated in agency proceedings.  \na. The Court\u2019s \u201cstatutory interpretation cases al-\nmost always start with a careful consideration of the text, \nand there is no reason to do otherwise here.\u201d Brnovich v. \nDemocratic Nat\u2019l Comm., 594 U.S. 647, 667 (2021). As \npart of that analysis, courts \u201cshould not interpret each \nword in a statute with blinders on, refusing to look at the \nword\u2019s function within the broader statutory context.\u201d \nAbramski v. United States, 573 U.S. 169, 179 n.6 (2014). \nA provision \u201cthat may seem ambiguous in isolation is of-\nten clarified by the remainder of the statutory scheme.\u201d \nId. Here, applying this rule leads to one conclusion: To \nbe a \u201cparty aggrieved,\u201d Texas must only have partici-\npated in some way in the agency proceeding.  \nAs the Commission\u2019s own authority recognizes, \nNRC.Br.17, the term \u201cparty\u201d in common parlance \u201cis not \n\n10 \n \nrestricted to strict meaning of plaintiff or defendant in a \nlawsuit, being defined as one concerned in or privy to a \nmatter, as in the relation of accessory or confidant, and \nagain a partial person, one who takes sides.\u201d BLACK\u2019S \nLAW DICTIONARY 1278 (4th ed. 1951). The term includes \nany \u201cperson concerned or having or taking part in any \naffair, matter, transaction, or proceeding.\u201d Id; see also, \ne.g., THE RANDOM HOUSE DICTIONARY OF THE ENGLISH \nLANGUAGE 1416 (2d unabridged ed. 1987). Indeed, the \nCourt has used \u201cperson \u2026 aggrieved\u201d and \u201caggrieved \nparty\u201d interchangeably. Darby v. Cisneros, 509 U.S. 137, \n146 (1993) (quoting 5 U.S.C. \u00a7702). Thus, absent a con-\ntrary, specialized meaning, \u201cparty\u201d means \u201cparticipa-\ntor.\u201d XI THE OXFORD ENGLISH DICTIONARY 282 (2d. ed. \n1989). \nThat ordinary meaning controls here. Because of the \nHobbs Act\u2019s breadth, the term \u201cparty\u201d must apply to \n\u201cseveral quite different agencies and several types of \nproceedings,\u201d including adjudications and rulemakings. \nPet.App.38a. After all, the Hobbs Act\u2019s \u201cclear words\u201d \nmake \u201cno distinction between orders which promulgate \nrules and orders in adjudicative proceedings.\u201d Gage v. \nU.S. Atomic Energy Comm\u2019n, 479 F.2d 1214, 1218 (D.C. \nCir. 1973). Yet no one disputes that filing comments \nmakes one a \u201cparty aggrieved\u201d for a rulemaking chal-\nlenge. Id. Accordingly, where a party filed comments set-\nting forth its legal position, it makes no sense to require \nfurther participation in an evidentiary hearing because \nnotice-and-comment rulemaking does not require hear-\nings. See, e.g., Vt. Yankee Nuclear Power Corp. v. \nNRDC, Inc., 435 U.S. 519, 545 (1978).    \nb. This plain-text reading of \u201cparty aggrieved\u201d also \ncomports with statutory context. For one thing, the \nHobbs Act expressly explains that unless hearings are \n\n11 \n \notherwise required by law, they are not necessary to \nseek review. \u201cWhen the agency has not held a hearing \nbefore taking the action of which review is sought,\u201d a \n\u201ccourt of appeals shall determine whether a hearing is \nrequired by law\u201d and may \u201cpass on the issues presented\u201d \notherwise. 28 U.S.C. \u00a72347(b)(1)-(2). The court may also \ntransfer the litigation to a district court for a hearing. Id. \n\u00a72347(b)(3). Because jurisdiction attaches irrespective of \nwhether an agency hearing occurred, it cannot be that a \ncourt lacks jurisdiction unless a party seeks a hearing.   \nThe Hobbs Act\u2019s intervention provision reinforces \nthat point. Contra NRC.Br.19; ISP.Br.25-26. A party in \ninterest in an agency proceeding may intervene (often as \na defendant) \u201cas of right\u201d in subsequent court proceed-\nings brought by some other person, but those \u201cwhose in-\nterests are affected by the order of the agency\u201d and who \nare not a party in interest must seek leave to intervene \nin such litigation. 28 U.S.C. \u00a72348. By its terms, this pro-\nvision governs who may intervene in court, but says \nnothing about who may institute judicial proceedings. \nThat Congress distinguished between instituting review \nand intervention precludes conflating the concepts. Nor \ncould the Act work otherwise\u2014there is no party in inter-\nest in rulemaking. \nAlabama Power Co. v. FCC, 311 F.3d 1357 (11th Cir. \n2002), is not to the contrary. Contra NRC.Br.19; \nISP.Br.25-26. There, the Eleventh Circuit recognized \nthat a \u201c\u2018party aggrieved\u2019 is one who participated in the \nagency proceeding,\u201d id. at 1366 (emphasis added)\u2014\nTexas\u2019s position. But multiple adjudications occurred in \nthat case. Id. at 1365-67. The court concluded that par-\nticipating in one adjudication does not make someone a \nparty aggrieved by a different adjudication. Id. Whether \nan entity that had participated in some other way in the \n\n12 \n \nagency proceeding could seek review was not at issue. Id. \nat 1366-67.    \nc. Reading the word \u201cparty\u201d to mean \u201cparticipant\u201d \nalso comports with the purpose of the \u201cparty aggrieved\u201d \nrequirement: namely, \u201cto ensure that the agency had the \nopportunity to consider the issue that petitioners are \nconcerned with.\u201d Pet.App.17a; see Gage, 479 F.2d at \n1219. This allows agencies to compile the administrative \nrecord, the \u201cfocal point\u201d for judicial review. Fla. Power \n& Light Co. v. Lorion, 470 U.S. 729, 743 (1985). \nThis case proves as much. The Commission received \nTexas\u2019s objections while the proceeding was ongoing. \nJ.A.117-22, 203-08. But the Commission had already re-\njected such legal arguments. See, e.g., Private Fuel Stor-\nage L.L.C., 56 N.R.C. 390, 392 (Dec. 18, 2002). It thus \nwould serve no purpose to require Texas to seek an evi-\ndentiary hearing to advance a legal argument the Com-\nmission had already rejected. \nd. Finally, if any doubts existed, the \u201cstrong pre-\nsumption favoring judicial review of administrative ac-\ntion\u201d squelches it. Salinas v. U.S. R.R. Ret. Bd., 592 U.S. \n188, 196 (2021) (citation omitted). Nothing suggests that \nCongress overcame that presumption by embedding in \nthe Hobbs Act a term whose meaning supposedly \nchanges depending on the form of proceeding an agency \nuses. And Congress plainly did not enact such a chame-\nleon-like provision to allow an agency to block judicial re-\nview by denying intervention based on its view of the \nmerits, as happened to Fasken and would have happened \nto Texas.   \n2. The Commission may not limit a court\u2019s \njurisdiction.  \nBeyond what the Hobbs Act says, the Court should \nnot lose sight of what the Hobbs Act is\u2014a jurisdictional \n\n13 \n \nstatute. Jurisdictional statutes trigger special rules of in-\nterpretation that also require affirmance.   \na. Because \u201c[o]nly Congress may determine a lower \nfederal court\u2019s subject-matter jurisdiction,\u201d Hamer v. \nNeighborhood Housing Servs. of Chi., 583 U.S. 17, 19 \n(2017), it follows that \u201c[w]ithin constitutional bounds, \nCongress decides what cases the federal courts have ju-\nrisdiction to consider\u201d and \u201cunder what conditions,\u201d \nBowles v. Russell, 551 U.S. 205, 212-13 (2007). \u201cSepara-\ntion-of-powers concerns, moreover, caution \u2026 against \nreading legislation, absent clear statement, to place in \nexecutive hands authority to remove cases from the Ju-\ndiciary\u2019s domain.\u201d Kucana v. Holder, 558 U.S. 233, 237 \n(2010). Because Congress does not lightly let foxes guard \nhenhouses, it is \u201caxiomatic\u201d that \u201cagencies can neither \ngrant nor curtail federal court jurisdiction.\u201d Carlyle \nTowers Condo. Ass\u2019n, Inc. v. F.D.I.C., 170 F.3d 301, 310 \n(2d Cir. 1999). \nHere, neither the AEA nor the Hobbs Act authorizes \nthe Commission to impose jurisdictional requirements \non federal courts\u2014and certainly not clearly enough to \novercome the clear-statement rule. The AEA says that \n\u201cthe Commission shall grant a hearing upon the request \nof any person whose interest may be affected by the pro-\nceeding, and shall admit such person as a party to such \nproceeding.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a72239(a)(1)(A) (emphases added). \nIf someone requests a hearing, the Commission thus \nmust make that person a party. But see supra p. 12 (not-\ning that the Commission blocked Fasken from interven-\ning); infra pp. 16-17, 24. But it does not say someone \nmust request a hearing to seek judicial review. If it did, \nthe AEA would superimpose a jurisdictional require-\nment onto the Hobbs Act\u2014a different statute addressing \nmany agencies having nothing to do with the AEA. \n\n14 \n \nNor \ndoes \nthe \nHobbs \nAct \nrequire \nfollowing \nagency-created rules before seeking judicial review. Of \ncourse, when Congress conditions judicial review on com-\npliance with agency procedures, those procedures can be \njurisdictional. E.g., Richman Bros. Records, Inc. v. FCC, \n124 F.3d 1302, 1303 (D.C. Cir. 1997). But when Congress \nwants compliance with them to be \u201ca condition precedent \nto judicial review,\u201d 47 U.S.C. \u00a7155(c)(7), it says so\u2014ex-\npressly, id.; see also, e.g., 15 U.S.C. \u00a7717r(a); 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a71997e(a). Indeed, Congress explicitly enacted a juris-\ndictional exhaustion requirement for the FCC (another \nagency covered by the Hobbs Act) in the Communica-\ntions Act but did not do so for the NRC in the AEA. See \n47 U.S.C. \u00a7405(a), (b)(2); see also, e.g., 15 U.S.C. \u00a7717r(a); \n42 U.S.C. \u00a71997e(a).      \nb. Congress\u2019s use of \u201cparty aggrieved\u201d is also not a \npermission slip for agencies to create jurisdictional ex-\nhaustion requirements for three additional reasons. \nFirst, \u201c[w]hen a statute is reasonably susceptible to \ndivergent interpretation,\u201d the Court \u201cadopt[s] the read-\ning that accords with traditional understandings and \nbasic principles: that executive determinations generally \nare subject to judicial review.\u201d Kucana, 558 U.S. at 251. \nThe Court has \u201cconsistently applied that interpretive \nguide\u201d and \u201cassumes that Congress legislates with \nknowledge of the presumption,\u201d id. at 251-52 (cleaned \nup). Because Congress has not clearly indicated that the \nCommission can impose jurisdictional requirements, the \npresumption holds. \nSecond, Congress \u201cdoes not hide elephants in mouse-\nholes\u201d or \u201calter the fundamental details of a regulatory \nscheme in vague terms or ancillary provisions.\u201d Whit-\nman v. Am. Trucking Ass\u2019ns, 531 U.S. 457, 468 (2001). \nHere, far from the \u201cclear and convincing evidence\u201d \n\n15 \n \nneeded \u201cto dislodge the presumption,\u201d Kucana, 558 U.S. \nat 252, \u201cCongress intended to provide for initial court of \nappeals review of all final orders in licensing proceedings \nwhether or not a hearing before the Commission oc-\ncurred or could have occurred,\u201d Lorion, 470 U.S. at 737 \n(emphasis added).   \nThird, exhaustion requirements are essentially never \njurisdictional. E.g., Santos-Zacaria v. Garland, 598 U.S. \n411, 417 (2023). So even if the AEA imposes such a re-\nquirement (it doesn\u2019t), it would not bar review. \nc. Reading \u201cparty aggrieved\u201d as \u201cparticipant\u201d also \navoids jurisdictional confusion. \u201c[A]dministrative sim-\nplicity is a major virtue in a jurisdictional statute.\u201d Hertz \nCorp. v. Friend, 559 U.S. 77, 79 (2010). Not only do com-\nplex jurisdictional rules \u201cencourage gamesmanship\u201d and \n\u201ceat[] up time and money,\u201d but they burn \u201c[j]udicial re-\nsources,\u201d as courts must raise such issues sua sponte. Id. \nat 94. \nHere, ascribing jurisdictional consequences to the \ndistinction between rulemaking and adjudication is a rec-\nipe for confusion. The line between the two can be paper \nthin\u2014especially after SEC v. Chenery Corp., 332 U.S. \n194 (1947). Congress defined \u201crule\u201d as \u201cthe whole or a \npart of an agency statement of general or particular ap-\nplicability\u201d and \u201cadjudication\u201d largely as what\u2019s left over. \n5 U.S.C. \u00a7551(4)-(7) (emphases added). Decades of bewil-\nderment have ensued. See Ronald M. Levin, The Case for \n(Finally) Fixing the APA\u2019s Definition of \u201cRule,\u201d 56 AD-\nMIN. L. REV. 1077 (2004). An agency\u2019s choice of label is \nnot dispositive, e.g., Nat\u2019l Ass\u2019n of Home Builders v. U.S. \nArmy Corps of Eng\u2019rs, 417 F.3d 1272, 1284-85 (D.C. Cir. \n2005), and an agency may solicit comments in an adjudi-\ncation, e.g., Neustar, Inc. v. FCC, 857 F.3d 886, 895 (D.C. \nCir. 2017), while holding an evidentiary hearing in a \n\n16 \n \nrulemaking, e.g., Vt. Yankee, 435 U.S. at 524. And the \nFCC\u2014perhaps the most common Hobbs Act litigant\u2014\nsometimes switches between the two categories in the \nmiddle of a single proceeding or issues one decision that \nis both a rulemaking and an adjudication. See Qwest \nServs. Corp. v. FCC, 509 F.3d 531, 535-36 (D.C. Cir. \n2007).  \nIf \u201cparty aggrieved\u201d means \u201cparticipant,\u201d such con-\nfusion between rulemaking and adjudication is relatively \nharmless because courts can tell whether a litigant filed \ncomments or otherwise participated in agency proceed-\nings. But if the existence of a federal court\u2019s jurisdiction \ndepends on which category applies, commenters will be \nforced to flood agencies with motions to intervene in the \nface of any ambiguity. Moreover, if failure to follow an \nagency\u2019s procedural rules can bar judicial review, courts \nwill have to determine in every case\u2014potentially sua \nsponte, and without knowing the full universe of relevant \nrules or even having access to the full record\u2014whether \nevery procedure was followed. And if failure to follow \nonly certain rules may bar \u201cparty\u201d status, courts will \nhave to determine which rules are jurisdictional before \ndoublechecking whether those particular rules were fol-\nlowed. Courts also will be forced to resolve ancillary liti-\ngation regarding alleged violations of the rules and de-\nvelop new doctrines to prevent agencies from creating \njurisdictional traps or using ticky-tack violations to de-\nfeat judicial review.      \nd. Finally, the principle that jurisdiction and the \nmerits are distinct also supports jurisdiction. Whether a \nclaim is meritorious \u201cdoes not implicate subject-matter \njurisdiction, i.e., the court\u2019s \u2026 power to adjudicate the \ncase.\u201d Steel Co. v. Citizens for Better Env\u2019t, 523 U.S. 83, \n89 (1998). Yet here, the Commission refused to let \n\n17 \n \nFasken intervene\u2014thereby, in Petitioners\u2019 view, pre-\ncluding review of the subsequent licensing order\u2014be-\ncause the Commission believed Fasken was wrong on the \nmerits. See In re Interim Storage Partners LLC, 90 \nN.R.C. 31, 52 (2019). Nothing in \u201cparty aggrieved\u201d em-\npowers agencies to control access to courts by making \nsuch threshold merits determinations.  \n3. Petitioners\u2019 counterarguments fail. \nPetitioners advance at least six counterarguments. \nNone persuades.  \nFirst, the Commission asks the Court (at 17-18) to \nuse cases construing the False Claims Act or arising in \nthe class-action context to interpret the Hobbs Act term \n\u201cparty.\u201d But the presumption that \u201cthe same term has \nthe same meaning\u201d is not an ironclad rule even when the \nterm appears \u201cin a single statute.\u201d Env\u2019t Def. v. Duke \nEnergy Corp., 549 U.S. 561, 574 (2007). After all, \u201cmost \nwords have different shades of meaning and conse-\nquently may be variously construed.\u201d Id. \nHere, the Hobbs Act is a different statute\u2014one with \nits own context and history. And it would be particularly \ninappropriate to look across contexts with respect to the \nmeaning of the term \u201cparty,\u201d as the Court has already \nrecognized that the meaning of that specific term varies. \nFor example, another of Petitioners\u2019 cases\u2014this one in \nthe bankruptcy context\u2014adopts Texas\u2019s view of the \u201cor-\ndinary meaning\u201d of \u201cparty\u201d: namely, \u201cone concerned in \nan affair; a participator.\u201d Truck Ins. Exch. v. Kaiser \nGypsum Co., 602 U.S. 268, 278 (2024) (quoting WEB-\nSTER\u2019S NEW INT\u2019L DICTIONARY 1784 (2d. ed. 1949)).      \nSecond, Petitioners make much of the distinction be-\ntween the terms \u201cparty aggrieved\u201d in the Hobbs Act and \n\u201cperson ... aggrieved\u201d in \u00a7702 of the APA. NRC.Br.18; \nISP.Br.24. This Court, however, read \u201cperson \u2026 \n\n18 \n \naggrieved\u201d and \u201caggrieved party\u201d interchangeably in \nDarby. 509 U.S. at 146. To be sure, then-Judge Scalia \nreasoned that to \u201cgive meaning to that apparently inten-\ntional variation, [courts] must read \u2018party\u2019 as referring to \na party before the agency, not a party to the judicial pro-\nceeding.\u201d Simmons v. ICC, 716 F.2d 40, 43 (D.C. Cir. \n1983). But he said nothing about the question here: how \nsomeone becomes a \u201cparty\u201d before an agency. And when \nhe joined this Court, he explained that \u201cperson \u2026 ag-\ngrieved\u201d requires only that a plaintiff (1) \u201cidentify some \nagency action that affects him\u201d and (2) \u201cshow that he has \nsuffered legal wrong because of the challenged agency \naction.\u201d Lujan v. Nat\u2019l Wildlife Fed\u2019n, 497 U.S. 871, \n882-83 (1990) (quotation marks omitted). It does not re-\nquire intervening in agency proceedings.   \nThird, the Commission relies (at 19-20) on the AEA\u2019s \ndistinction between \u201cperson\u201d and \u201cparty.\u201d But the ques-\ntion is whether Texas may seek review under the Hobbs \nAct, not the AEA. The Hobbs Act covers many agen-\ncies\u2014not just the Commission\u2014so the AEA does not \ndictate the Hobbs Act\u2019s meaning. Nor does the Commis-\nsion\u2019s argument work on its own terms. The relevant \nAEA provision, 42 U.S.C. \u00a72239(a)(1)(A), shows that one \nway to become a party is to request a hearing. Because \nthe Hobbs Act applies to rulemakings and adjudications \nalike, that cannot be the only way to become a party. Nei-\nther does the AEA require anyone to seek a hearing. \nFourth, Petitioners argue that agencies must be able \nto create procedures for their own proceedings, and ISP \ninvokes the specter of someone \u201cslipping a handwritten \nnote under the door of the agency headquarters after the \ndeadline for comments has passed.\u201d ISP.Br.27. But filing \ncomments after a proceeding is over is not participation. \n\n19 \n \nTimely submitting comments in connection with a pend-\ning proceeding is different in kind. \nISP\u2019s example, moreover, reveals the danger of Peti-\ntioners\u2019 position. Under their logic, an agency could de-\nprive the indigent of judicial review simply by promul-\ngating rules with onerous formatting requirements like \nbarring handwritten comments or demanding that all \nsubmissions be on 8.5\u201d x 14\u201d paper. Petitioners\u2019 view that \nsubmitting comments to an agency has no more jurisdic-\ntional significance than filing an amicus brief is also \nwrong. NRC.Br.28; ISP.Br.26. Congress directs how \nsomeone becomes a party in court or before an agency. \nHere, no one disputes that under the Hobbs Act, filing \ncomments to an agency can make someone a party for \npurposes of judicial review. The only question is whether \nagency-created procedures can curtail that right to re-\nview for some proceedings.     \nFifth, Petitioners lean heavily on a handful of \nlower-court decisions, NRC.Br.28; ISP.Br.25, but such \ncases underscore why jurisdiction exists here. For exam-\nple, Ohio Nuclear-free Network v. NRC, 53 F.4th 236 \n(D.C. Cir. 2022), claims that \u201cinvocation of the appropri-\nate and available administrative procedure \u2026 is the stat-\nutorily prescribed prerequisite for this court\u2019s jurisdic-\ntion to entertain a petition to review a final NRC order,\u201d \nid. at 240 (quotation marks and alterations omitted). But \nthat is not what the Hobbs Act says, and Petitioners can-\nnot wring an exhaustion requirement out of the word \n\u201cparty.\u201d NRDC v. NRC, 823 F.3d 641 (D.C. Cir. 2016), \nand State ex rel. Balderas v. NRC, 59 F.4th 1112 (10th \nCir. 2023), are unpersuasive for similar reasons. \nIn all events, even if these cases were correct a year \nago, they are anachronisms today. Consider Balderas, \nwhich held that \u201cto assess status as a party,\u201d courts must \n\n20 \n \nfocus on \u201cthe practices of the agency.\u201d 59 F.4th at 1117. \nThe Tenth Circuit reasoned that \u201cif the Commission had \nrequired intervention and New Mexico didn\u2019t seek leave \nto intervene,\u201d then courts \u201cwould lack jurisdiction under \nthe Hobbs Act.\u201d Id. But agency practices cannot define a \njurisdictional statute. Because agencies no more \u201cadmin-\nister\u201d the Hobbs Act than they \u201cadminister\u201d 28 U.S.C. \n\u00a71331, such analysis would not work even under Chev-\nron. See Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. NRDC, Inc., 467 U.S. \n837, 842 (1984). But it cannot possibly be correct after \nLoper Bright.  \nNor does it matter how long the Commission\u2019s rules \nhave existed. Contra ISP.Br.25. The Commission can \ncreate rules for its proceedings. The question here is \nwhether compliance with those rules is a jurisdictional \nrequirement for judicial review. The Commission\u2019s rules \ndo not purport to govern a court\u2019s jurisdiction. And even \nif they did, \u201c[a] regulation\u2019s age is no antidote to clear \ninconsistency with a statute.\u201d Brown v. Gardner, 513 \nU.S. 115, 122 (1994). Because Texas is a \u201cparty ag-\ngrieved\u201d under the Hobbs Act, jurisdiction exists.  \nFinally, Petitioners retreat to policy. ISP complains \n(at 28) that \u201c[i]f any person can sue in court,\u201d there would \nbe no point in having \u201cextensive safety-based adjudica-\ntory hearings at the agency level at all.\u201d But it is not true \nthat \u201cany person\u201d may seek review\u2014a person must have \nparticipated in agency proceedings and have standing. \nMoreover, an \u201cextensive safety-based adjudicatory hear-\ning[],\u201d ISP.Br.28, may make sense for factual objections, \nbut not for questions of law, cf. Carr v. Saul, 593 U.S. 83, \n92-93 (2021). Even if exhaustion of legal issues could be \nrelevant, it would have been futile here because the Com-\nmission \u201cpredetermined\u201d its view of the State\u2019s argu-\nments. McCarthy v. Madigan, 503 U.S. 140, 148 (1992); \n\n21 \n \nsupra p. 12. ISP\u2019s rhetoric, moreover, elides that the \nHobbs Act does not require hearings. Supra pp. 10-11. \nIn fact, to the extent policy is relevant, it cuts against \nPetitioners. The rule from this case will apply not only to \ngovernments and energy companies, but also to victims \nof housing discrimination and small farmers. E.g., \n28 U.S.C. \u00a72342(2), (6). Many people lack the resources \nor training to intervene in complex agency proceedings. \nPetitioners\u2019 logic would also allow agencies covered by \nthe Hobbs Act to add onerous, confusing, or pointless \nhoops before such a commenter can be a \u201cparty\u201d to a \nrulemaking. The Court should not ascribe to Congress \nthe intent to deprive anyone of his or her day in court.       \nB. Courts may enjoin ultra vires action. \n1. Nonstatutory review applies here.  \nIn all events, courts need not rely on a specific statute \nwhere, as here, agency action is ultra vires. \na. Nonstatutory review has been a feature of our law \nfor centuries. \u201cIndeed, the most famous case of all, Mar-\nbury v. Madison, was a nonstatutory review case,\u201d and \n\u201cChief Justice Marshall himself applied nonstatutory re-\nview again in the well-known case of Osborn v. Bank of \nthe United States.\u201d Jonathan R. Siegel, Suing the Presi-\ndent: Nonstatutory Review Revisited, 97 COLUM. L. \nREV. 1612, 1625 (1997). In neither case did the plaintiff \nhave a \u201cspecific, statutory mechanism\u201d to sue under, yet \nthe Court held that relief was available via mandamus or \nthe common law. Id. at 1633. And throughout much of the \nearly republic, takings lawsuits were resolved not \nthrough statutory causes of action\u2014which did not exist \nuntil the Tucker Act\u2014but through nonstatutory relief. \nUnited States v. Lee, 106 U.S. 196 (1882); accord DeVil-\nlier v. Texas, 601 U.S. 285, 292-93 (2024); Knick v. Town-\nship of Scott, 588 U.S. 180, 197-201 (2019). \n\n22 \n \nThose challenging agency action also historically \nhave not relied on a cause of action like the APA\u2019s to chal-\nlenge ultra vires action. See, e.g., Aditya Bamzai, The Or-\nigins of Judicial Deference to Executive Interpretation, \n126 YALE L.J. 908, 948, 972 & n.271 (2017). Review was \navailable where an agency head \u201cexceeded his authority \nor this court should be of opinion that his action was \nclearly wrong.\u201d Bates & Guild Co. v. Payne, 194 U.S. 106, \n109 (1904). Hence, \u201c[l]ong before the APA, the \u2018main \nweapon in the arsenal for attacking federal administra-\ntive action\u2019 was a suit in equity seeking injunctive relief.\u201d \nFed. Express Corp. v. U.S Dep\u2019t of Com., 39 F.4th 756, \n763 (D.C. Cir. 2022) (quoting KENNETH CULP DAVIS & \nRICHARD J. PIERCE, JR., ADMINISTRATIVE LAW TREA-\nTISE \u00a718.4, at 179 (3d ed. 1994)).   \nSuch review has continued into modern times. No \nstatute provided a cause of action in, for example, \nYoungstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U.S. 579 \n(1952). Siegel, supra, at 1636, 1672 & n.265. And \u201creview \nof federal agency action is available when an agency ac-\ntion is ultra vires, that is, when the agency has plainly \nviolated an unambiguous and mandatory legal require-\nment.\u201d Cole, supra, at 3 n.33 (citing, inter alia, Kyne, 358 \nU.S. at 188-89; Larson v. Domestic & Foreign Com. \nCorp., 337 U.S. 682, 689-90 (1949)). Courts thus need not \nrely on statutory causes of action \u201cto strike down an \n[agency] order \u2026 made in excess of [the agency\u2019s] dele-\ngated powers and contrary to a specific prohibition in the \nAct.\u201d Kyne, 358 U.S. at 188. \nb. The Fifth Circuit properly applied this longstand-\ning body of law, explaining that ultra vires review allows \na person who was \u201cnot a party to the original agency pro-\nceeding\u201d to seek review \u201cwhere,\u201d inter alia, \u201cthe agency \naction is attacked as exceeding [its] power.\u201d Pet.App.19a. \n\n23 \n \nAs Judge Jones explained, the doctrine \u201cliterally refers \nto being \u2018outside\u2019 the agency\u2019s power, i.e. in defiance of \nthe limits placed by Congress in the agency\u2019s governing \nstatute or the Constitution.\u201d Pet.App.43a. Such analysis \nechoes Larson, where this Court explained that if an \u201cof-\nficer\u2019s powers are limited by statute, his actions beyond \nthose limitations\u201d are \u201cultra vires\u201d and so \u201cmay be made \nthe object of specific relief.\u201d 337 U.S. at 689.  \nFor reasons explained by the Fifth Circuit and set \nforth below, \u201c[t]he Commission has no statutory author-\nity to issue the license.\u201d Pet.App.21a; infra Part II. It is \nnot a close question. An apt term to describe such defi-\nance of Congress is ultra vires.   \n2. Petitioners\u2019 counterarguments again fail.  \nPetitioners deride ultra vires review as atextual, \nNRC.Br.20; ISP.Br.19, yet ignore history. \u201cStatutes \nwhich invade the common law \u2026 are to be read with a \npresumption favoring the retention of long-established \nand familiar principles, except when a statutory purpose \nto the contrary is evident.\u201d United States v. Texas, 507 \nU.S. 529, 534 (1993). It is implausible that Congress dis-\nplaced longstanding common law with the phrase \u201cparty \naggrieved.\u201d E.g., Fed. Express, 39 F.4th at 763 (nonstat-\nutory review survived APA\u2019s enactment).  \nNor is ultra vires a synonym for \u201cwrong,\u201d and it does \nnot require courts to draw \u201chighly malleable distinc-\ntions\u201d between claims. Contra ISP.Br.22; NRC.Br.15. \nCourts have long protected against ultra vires action. \nPetitioners\u2019 concerns, moreover, ring particularly hollow \nnow that courts \u201cmay not defer to an agency interpreta-\ntion of the law simply because a statute is ambiguous.\u201d \nLoper Bright, 603 U.S. at 413. Nothing about an admin-\nistrative record, the \u201cfocal point for judicial review,\u201d Lo-\nrion, 470 U.S. at 743, speaks to what a statute means.   \n\n24 \n \nPetitioners insist that cases like Kyne are irrelevant \nbecause \u201cthere is a meaningful and adequate opportunity \nfor judicial review under the relevant statute.\u201d ISP.Br.21 \n(referencing Bd. of Governors of Fed. Rsrv. Sys. v. \nMCorp Fin., Inc., 502 U.S. 32, 43-44 (1991)). Fasken was \nrefused intervention because the Commission did not \nthink Fasken\u2019s arguments were meritorious. The same \nwould have happened to Texas; after all, the Commission \npreviously rejected Texas\u2019s primary legal objections. \nThis conflation of the merits and jurisdiction misreads \nthe Hobbs Act, but if Petitioners were correct, it would \nbe proof positive there is not \u201ca meaningful and adequate \nopportunity for judicial review.\u201d Petitioners cannot have \nit both ways.  \nII. Congress Has Not Authorized the Commission to \nLicense Private, Offsite Storage Facilities. \nCongress mandated that spent nuclear fuel should be \npermanently disposed of at Yucca Mountain. Congress \njust as clearly mandated that temporary storage may \ntake place at only one of two locations: the reactor site or \na federally operated facility. That language controls.   \nA. The Commission has limited authority to \nlicense offsite storage. \n1. The AEA does not allow ISP\u2019s license.  \na. Petitioners appear to agree that the AEA is silent \nregarding the key issue here\u2014whether the Commission \nmay license a private entity to possess or store spent nu-\nclear fuel. As the Commission\u2019s Chairman recognized in \n1978, the AEA \u201cdoes not explicitly authorize regulation \nof radioactive waste facilities.\u201d1 That silence is all but \n \n1 NRC, NUREG-0527, Regulation of Federal Radioactive \nWaste Activities: Report to Congress on Extending the Nuclear \nRegulatory Commission\u2019s Licensing or Regulatory Authority to \n\n25 \n \ndispositive. Because agencies \u201care creatures of statute,\u201d \nthey \u201chave no inherent powers\u201d and \u201cmay act only be-\ncause, and only to the extent that, Congress affirma-\ntively has delegated them the power to act.\u201d Am. Bus. \nAss\u2019n v. Slater, 231 F.3d 1, 9 (D.C. Cir. 2000) (Sentelle, \nJ., concurring). \nNor can Petitioners draw support from what Con-\ngress allowed the Commission to do. Unlike the sweep-\ning grants of authority that generated concern in recent \nyears, see, e.g., Gundy v. United States, 588 U.S. 128 \n(2019), the AEA is highly reticulated. The Commission \nmay \u201cissue licenses to,\u201d among other things, \u201cpossess \u2026 \nspecial nuclear material,\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a72073(a), \u201cdistribute \nsource material within the United States to qualified ap-\nplicants requesting such material,\u201d id. \u00a72093(a), and \u201cuse \nbyproduct material,\u201d id. \u00a72111(a). Even then, licenses \nare purpose-specific: Licensees cannot do just anything \nwith such materials; they can do only things like research \nand development, medical testing, or national defense. \nId. \u00a7\u00a72073(a), 2093(a), 2111(a), 2201(b).  \nPetitioners have not identified a statute that allows \nthe Commission to license private, offsite possession of \n\u201cspent nuclear fuel,\u201d the material at issue here. Rather, \nCongress distinguished \u201cspent nuclear fuel\u201d from \u201cspe-\ncial nuclear material,\u201d \u201csource material[],\u201d and \u201cbyprod-\nuct material[]\u201d when it required the Commission to \u201ces-\ntablish a system\u201d to ensure the secure transfer of \u201cby-\nproduct materials, source materials, special nuclear \nmaterials, high-level radioactive waste, spent nuclear \nfuel, transuranic waste, and low-level radioactive waste.\u201d \n \nFederal Radioactive Waste Storage and Disposal Activities at G-9 \n(Sept. \n1979), \nhttps://www.google.com/books/edition/Regula-\ntion_of_Federal_Radioactive_Waste/ERpSAAAA-\nMAAJ?hl=en&gbpv=0. \n\n26 \n \nId. \u00a72210i(a)-(b) (emphases added). Indeed, Congress \nseparately defined \u201cspecial nuclear material,\u201d \u201csource \nmaterial,\u201d \u201cbyproduct material,\u201d and \u201cspent nuclear \nfuel\u201d in 42 U.S.C. \u00a72014, confirming their separateness. \nBecause the AEA expressly distinguishes \u201cspent nuclear \nfuel\u201d from materials the Commission may license, \u201cit is \nfair to suppose that Congress considered the unnamed \npossibility\u201d of authorizing licenses for such material \u201cand \nmeant to say no to it.\u201d Marx v. Gen. Revenue Corp., 568 \nU.S. 371, 381 (2013) (quotation marks omitted). \nb. Even if the AEA authorized licenses for pos-\nsessing spent nuclear fuel, it does not do so for storing it. \nThe Commission may grant licenses to \u201cpossess \u2026 spe-\ncial nuclear material,\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a72073(a), \u201cissue licenses \nfor and to distribute source material,\u201d id. \u00a72093(a), or li-\ncense \u201cuse\u201d of \u201cbyproduct material,\u201d id. \u00a72111(a)\u2014but \nonly for particular activities. For example, the Commis-\nsion may license an entity to \u201cpossess,\u201d id. \u00a72073(a), \n\u201cspecial nuclear material\u201d or \u201csource material\u201d only for \nresearch \nand \ndevelopment, \nid. \n\u00a7\u00a72073(a)(1)-(2), \n2093(a)(1)-(2), \u201cmedical therapy,\u201d id. \u00a7\u00a72073(a)(2), \n2093(a)(2), \u201cutilization or production facilities,\u201d id. \n\u00a7\u00a72073(a)(3), 2093(a)(3); see id. \u00a72133(a), or \u201csuch other \nuses as the Commission determines to be appropriate to \ncarry out the purposes of this chapter,\u201d id. \u00a7\u00a72073(a)(4), \n2093(a)(4). Likewise, it may license the \u201cuse\u201d of \u201cbyprod-\nuct material\u201d only for research and development, medi-\ncal therapy, \u201cindustrial uses, agricultural uses, or such \nother useful applications as may be developed.\u201d Id. \n\u00a72111(a).  \nThe Commission did not license ISP to possess spent \nnuclear fuel for any of these purposes. Pet.App.55a. Nei-\nther Petitioner argues to the contrary\u2014for example, \nthat ISP\u2019s license concerns \u201cresearch and development\u201d \n\n27 \n \nor \u201cmedical therapy.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a72073(a)(1)-(2), \n2093(a)(1)-(2), 2111(a).    \nNor does ISP\u2019s license pertain to \u201cutilization or pro-\nduction facilities,\u201d each of which also has a specific defi-\nnition. Id. \u00a7\u00a72073(a)(3), 2093(a)(3). A \u201c[u]tilization facil-\nity\u201d is \u201cany equipment or device, except an atomic \nweapon,\u201d that the Commission has determined is \u201ccapa-\nble of making use of special nuclear material\u201d in signifi-\ncant ways. Id. \u00a72014(cc), (cc)(1); see also id. \u00a72014(cc)(2). \nAnd a \u201cproduction facility\u201d includes \u201cany equipment or \ndevice\u201d that the Commission determines is \u201ccapable of \nthe production of special nuclear material\u201d in significant \nways. Id. \u00a72014(v)(1); see also id. \u00a72014(v)(2). ISP\u2019s li-\ncense does not authorize ISP to use \u201cspecial nuclear ma-\nterial\u201d\u2014which is, again, different from \u201cspent nuclear \nfuel,\u201d supra pp. 25-26\u2014in any \u201cequipment or device,\u201d \n42 U.S.C. \u00a72014(cc)(1)-(2). Neither does it authorize ISP \nto \u201cmake, produce, or refine\u201d anything. Id. \u00a72014(u).  \nThe catchall provisions, id. \u00a7\u00a72073(a)(4), 2093(a)(4), \n2111(a), cannot fill this gap. \u201c[C]ourts \u2026 interpret a \u2018gen-\neral or collective term\u2019 at the end of a list of specific\u201d \nterms \u201cin light of any \u2018common attribute[s]\u2019\u201d the \u201cspecific \nitems\u201d share. Sw. Airlines Co. v. Saxon, 596 U.S. 450, 458 \n(2022) (quotation marks omitted); see also ANTONIN \nSCALIA & BRYAN A. GARNER, READING LAW: THE IN-\nTERPRETATION OF LEGAL TEXTS 199 (2012). Thus, a \n\u201cgeneral or collective term at the end of a list of specific \nitems is typically controlled and defined by reference to \nthe specific classes \u2026 that precede it.\u201d Fischer v. United \nStates, 603 U.S. 480, 487 (2024) (quotation marks omit-\nted).   \nThe specific uses for which the Commission may li-\ncense possession or use of the enumerated materials thus \n\u201ccontrol[s] and define[s],\u201d Circuit City Stores, Inc. v. \n\n28 \n \nAdams, 532 U.S. 105, 115 (2001), the \u201cother uses\u201d for \nwhich the Commission may license possession or use. \nEach of the specifically listed activities involves an af-\nfirmative, productive application of the material. See 42 \nU.S.C. \u00a7\u00a72073(a), 2093(a), 2111(a). Storage (whether \ntemporary or permanent) does not.    \n2. The NWPA also dooms ISP\u2019s license.  \na. Even if the AEA, standing alone, were ambigu-\nous, the NWPA requires affirming the Fifth Circuit\u2019s \njudgment. Statutes \u201cdealing with the same subject,\u201d like \nthe AEA and NWPA, \u201cbeing in pari materia,\u201d \u201care to be \ninterpreted together, as though they were one law.\u201d \nSCALIA & GARNER, supra, at 252 (emphasis omitted). \n\u201cStatutes cannot be read intelligently if the eye is closed \nto considerations evidenced in affiliated statutes.\u201d Felix \nFrankfurter, Some Reflections on the Reading of Stat-\nutes, 47 COLUM. L. REV. 527, 539 (1947). So, \u201ca \u2018later act \ncan \u2026 be regarded as a legislative interpretation of [an] \nearlier act \u2026 in the sense that it aids in ascertaining the \nmeaning of the words as used in their contemporary set-\nting.\u2019\u201d Erlenbaugh v. United States, 409 U.S. 239, 243-44 \n(1972) (alteration in original) (quoting United States v. \nStewart, 311 U.S. 60, 64-65 (1940)); see id. at 244 (indicat-\ning that this canon can help resolve textual ambiguities). \nThe NWPA limits the type of facilities the Commis-\nsion may license to \u201cprovide for the permanent disposal \nof \u2026 spent nuclear fuel.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a710131(a)(4). Until \nthe federal government fulfills the Yucca Mountain man-\ndate, the Department may not consider, id. \u00a710101(18), \nand the Commission may not license, a repository any-\nwhere else, id. \u00a7\u00a75842, 10172. Furthermore, Congress \nprovided for temporary offsite storage\u2014but only in fed-\neral repositories, and only under certain circumstances. \nId. \u00a7\u00a710151, 10155-56. \n\n29 \n \nb. Numerous features of the NWPA confirm that the \nCommission cannot grant ISP\u2019s license. First, ISP\u2019s fa-\ncility will likely be anything but temporary. For over \nthirty-five years, the Executive Branch has refused to \ncomply with Congress\u2019s directives about Yucca Moun-\ntain. The Commission offers no reason to believe that the \nnext forty years\u2014or more\u2014will be different. The Com-\nmission \u201capparently has no long-term plan other than \nhoping for a geologic repository,\u201d and if it \u201ccontinues to \nfail in its quest to establish one,\u201d then spent nuclear fuel \nmust \u201cbe stored\u201d at purportedly \u201ctemporary\u201d storage \nsites \u201con a permanent basis.\u201d New York, 681 F.3d at 479. \nBefore granting this license, the federal government \nmade clear that it would not pursue a facility in Yucca \nMountain\u2014the only authorized permanent repository. \nAny assurance that this license is temporary is thus un-\nserious. The Court is \u201cnot required to exhibit a naivet\u00e9 \nfrom which ordinary citizens are free.\u201d Dep\u2019t of Com. v. \nNew York, 588 U.S. 752, 785 (2019) (quotation marks \nomitted). \n \nSecond, even if a presumption of good faith required \nassuming that the ISP facility will be temporary, it would \nnot save the license. Congress has declared that \u201cthe per-\nsons owning and operating civilian nuclear power reac-\ntors have the primary responsibility for providing in-\nterim storage of spent nuclear fuel from such reactors, \nby maximizing, to the extent practical, the effective use \nof existing storage facilities at the site of each civilian \nnuclear power reactor\u201d and \u201cby adding new onsite stor-\nage capacity in a timely manner where practical.\u201d \n42 U.S.C. \u00a710151(a)(1) (emphasis added); accord id. \n\u00a710151(b)(1). It thus charged the Commission to \u201cexpe-\ndite \u2026 the addition of [any] needed new storage capacity \nat the site of each civilian nuclear power reactor\u201d to meet \n\n30 \n \nthat end. Id. \u00a710151(a)(2); see also id. \u00a710152 (using \n\u201cshall\u201d). Congress thus indicated that outside of limited \nexceptions for federal facilities, reactors should store \ntheir own spent fuel onsite until a permanent national re-\npository is built.   \nTrue, Congress recognized that sometimes, storage \nat a reactor site might not be able \u201creasonably [to] pro-\nvide adequate storage capacity.\u201d Id. \u00a710151(a)(3). In \nthose circumstances, Congress ordered the federal gov-\nernment to \u201cprovide\u201d limited \u201cinterim storage\u201d capacity \n\u201cof spent nuclear fuel\u201d away from the reactor site. Id. \nEven then, however, Congress limited the circumstances \nunder which the federal government may \u201cprovide\u201d such \nstorage: It may do so only at a federal facility. Id. \n\u00a7\u00a710151-57. It may also construct \u201cmonitored retrievable \nstorage\u201d facilities, id. \u00a7\u00a710161-69, but that category does \nnot encompass ISP\u2019s proposed facility, id. \u00a710161(b). \nThus, the Commission may license interim storage only \nif it is (1) located at the reactor site or (2) federally owned \nand operated. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a710151, 10155. ISP\u2019s facility \nis neither.  \nThird, Congress declared that \u201c[n]otwithstanding \nany other\u201d law, \u201cnothing in\u201d the NWPA \u201cshall be con-\nstrued to encourage, authorize, or require the private or \nFederal use, purchase, lease, or other acquisition of any \nstorage facility located away from the site of any civilian \nnuclear power reactor and not owned by the Federal \nGovernment\u201d on the date of the NWPA\u2019s enactment. Id. \n\u00a710155(h). Yet ISP\u2019s facility is not located at a reactor \nsite and (of course) not federal.   \nThese provisions confirm that the Commission can-\nnot license a private, offsite interim storage facility for \nspent nuclear fuel. ISP tries (at 3-4, 9-10) to portray this \nclear language as unfairly punishing industry for the \n\n31 \n \nfederal government\u2019s mistakes. But the statute says \nwhat it says, and it is for Congress\u2014not the Commis-\nsion\u2014to change it. Regardless, equity hardly favors ISP. \nUnder the NWPA, Texas was supposed to enjoy statu-\ntory protections, including a veto over siting of an in-\nterim-storage facility that only Congress could override. \nSee 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a710136, 10155(d), 10156(e), 10166, 10169. \nUnfortunately, the Commission ignored those require-\nments, too. \n3. The major-questions and no-elephants-in-\nmouseholes doctrines also apply.  \na. Additional rules of interpretation further confirm \nthat Congress never authorized this license. \nThe major-questions doctrine serves two purposes. \nFirst, it \u201cis a tool for discerning\u2014not departing from\u2014\nthe text\u2019s most natural interpretation.\u201d Biden v. \nNebraska, 143 S.Ct. 2355, 2376 (2023) (Barrett, J., \nconcurring). It starts from the premise that Congress \n\u201cspeak[s] clearly when authorizing an agency to exercise \npowers of \u2018vast \u201ceconomic and political significance.\u201d\u2019\u201d \nAla. Ass\u2019n of Realtors v. HHS, 594 U.S. 758, 764 (2021) \n(per curiam) (quoting Util. Air Regul. Grp. v. EPA, 573 \nU.S. 302, 324 (2014)). Second, it helps effectuate \nnondelegation principles. \u201cMuch as constitutional rules \nabout retroactive legislation and sovereign immunity \nhave their corollary clear-statement rules, Article I\u2019s \nVesting Clause has its own: the major questions \ndoctrine.\u201d West Virginia, 597 U.S. at 740 (Gorsuch, J., \nconcurring). Congress thus must speak clearly when \ndelegating authority to address questions with a fraught \n\u201cpolitical history,\u201d including \u201cCongress\u2019s creation of \u2018a \ndistinct regulatory scheme\u2019\u201d and the \u201cindustry\u2019s \n\u2018significant\u2019 role in \u2018the American economy.\u2019\u201d Nebraska, \n143 S.Ct. at 2382 (Barrett, J., concurring) (quoting FDA \n\n32 \n \nv. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., 529 U.S. 120, \n159-60 (2000)). \nDistinct in a critical respect from the major-questions \ndoctrine, the no-elephants-in-mouseholes doctrine pro-\nvides that even if a question is not major in terms of eco-\nnomic or political significance, an agency still cannot use \nancillary provisions to alter \u201cfundamental details of a \nregulatory scheme.\u201d Heating, Air Conditioning & Re-\nfrigeration Distribs. Int\u2019l v. EPA, 71 F.4th 59, 67-68 \n(D.C. Cir. 2023) (quoting Whitman, 531 U.S. at 468); see \nalso Epic Sys. Corp. v. Lewis, 584 U.S. 497, 515 (2018); \nMCI Telecomms. Corp. v. AT&T Co., 512 U.S. 218, 225-\n31 (1994). This doctrine does not sound in nondelegation \nconcerns, Heating, 71 F.4th at 67-68; instead, it is partic-\nularized application of the \u201ccommonplace\u201d rule that \u201cthe \nspecific governs the general,\u201d which applies with special \nforce where \u201cCongress has enacted a comprehensive \nscheme and has deliberately targeted specific problems \nwith specific solutions,\u201d RadLAX Gateway Hotel, LLC v. \nAmalgamated Bank, 566 U.S. 639, 645 (2012) (cleaned \nup).      \nb. It was \u201cclear that from the very beginnings of \ncommercial nuclear power,\u201d Congress \u201cwas aware of the \nabsence of a permanent waste disposal facility.\u201d NRDC \nv. NRC, 582 F.2d 166, 170 (2d Cir. 1978). But indefinite \nprivate storage was not then regarded \u201cas a feasible and \nacceptable method of disposal \u2026 of spent [nuclear] fuel.\u201d \nFla. Power & Light Co. v. Westinghouse Elec. Corp., 826 \nF.2d 239, 244 (4th Cir. 1987). Instead, \u201c[g]overnment and \nindustry accepted reprocessing as the only practical \nmethod of disposing of spent fuel.\u201d Id. at 246; supra \npp. 2-3. The AEA\u2019s failure to authorize offsite storage of \nspent nuclear fuel reflects this widespread belief. \n\n33 \n \nSo, when \u201cthe private reprocessing industry col-\nlapsed\u201d in the 1970s, \u201cthe nuclear industry was con-\nfronted with an unanticipated accumulation of spent nu-\nclear fuel\u201d with no long-term plans for managing nuclear \nwaste. Idaho, 945 F.2d at 298. Congress, in turn, recog-\nnized that this \u201caccumulation\u201d\u2014which occurred decades \nafter the AEA\u2019s enactment\u2014created a \u201cnational prob-\nlem,\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a710131(a)(2), and that \u201cspent nuclear \nfuel\u201d is a \u201cmajor subject[] of public concern,\u201d id. \n\u00a710131(a)(7). It answered that \u201cmajor\u201d question by en-\nacting the NWPA to solve \u201cthe problems of civilian radi-\noactive waste disposal.\u201d Id. \u00a710131(a)(3). \nIn the NWPA\u2014a subsequent, more specific statute \nthan the AEA\u2014Congress decided that the \u201csolution\u201d to \nthis \u201cproblem[],\u201d id., was a permanent national reposi-\ntory deep underground in Nevada, and until then, \n\u201climit[ed] temporary storage to private at-the-reactor \nstorage or at federal sites,\u201d Pet.App.29a; see supra \npp. 3-4. Yet given political sensitivities, Congress\u2019s deci-\nsion \u201chas been hotly politically contested for over a half \ncentury.\u201d Pet.App.30a. And it was not until decades after \nthe NWPA\u2019s enactment\u2014and after the Executive \nBranch made clear it would not obey Congress\u2019s direc-\ntives regarding Yucca Mountain\u2014that the Commission \npurported to issue a license like this one.  \nWhere, as here, \u201can agency claims to discover in a \nlong-extant statute an unheralded power to regulate \u2018a \nsignificant portion of the American economy,\u2019\u201d courts \n\u201ctypically greet its announcement with a measure of \nskepticism.\u201d Util. Air, 573 U.S. at 324 (quoting Brown & \nWilliamson, 529 U.S. at 159). And where, as here, Con-\ngress enacts a comprehensive scheme to address a spe-\ncific problem, agencies cannot invoke ancillary provi-\nsions of an older statute that do not mention that \n\n34 \n \nproblem to bypass Congress\u2019s scheme. To uphold this li-\ncense, the Court \u201cwould have to conclude that Congress \nnot only\u201d hid \u201ca rather large elephant in a rather obscure \nmousehole,\u201d but also \u201cburied\u201d that elephant \u201cbeneath an \nincredibly deep mound of specificity, none of which bears \nthe footprints of the beast or any indication that Con-\ngress even suspected its presence.\u201d Am. Bar Ass\u2019n v. \nFTC, 430 F.3d 457, 469 (D.C. Cir. 2005). \nB. Petitioners\u2019 theories again fall flat. \nPetitioners again press numerous counterarguments. \nNone supports reversal. \n1. Petitioners misunderstand the separation \nof powers. \na. To start, the Commission repeatedly faults Texas \n(at, e.g., 42, 45-46) for failing to identify where Congress \nprohibited it from issuing a license like ISP\u2019s. That\u2019s \nbackwards. \u201cWere courts to presume a delegation of \npower absent an express withholding of such power, \nagencies would enjoy virtually limitless hegemony.\u201d Atl. \nCity Elec. Co. v. FERC, 295 F.3d 1, 9 (D.C. Cir. 2002); see \nalso La. Pub. Serv., 476 U.S. at 374. Courts do not \u201cpre-\nsume a delegation of power merely because Congress \nhas not expressly withheld such power.\u201d Ethyl Corp. v. \nEPA, 51 F.3d 1053, 1060 (D.C. Cir. 1995). \nb. Petitioners also argue that the major-questions \ndoctrine is inapt. ISP.Br.38-39; NRC.Br.48-49. But that \ndoctrine constitutes an additional reason to affirm; the \nCourt can and should reject ISP\u2019s license based on the \nAEA\u2019s and NWPA\u2019s plain language alone. See, e.g., Ne-\nbraska, 143 S.Ct. at 2375 (invoking major-questions doc-\ntrine in the alternative). In any event, the doctrine ap-\nplies if a case involves questions of \u201cvast \u2018economic and \npolitical significance.\u2019\u201d Ala. Ass\u2019n of Realtors, 594 U.S. at \n\n35 \n \n764 (quoting Util. Air, 573 U.S. at 324). ISP does not dis-\npute that this case involves such questions. Nor could it \nwhen Congress declared that what to do with spent nu-\nclear fuel is a \u201cmajor\u201d problem. 42 U.S.C. \u00a710131(a)(7). \nPetitioners thus must show that Congress provided the \nCommission with clear authority. Supra pp. 24-25.  \nThe Commission\u2019s insistence (at 49) that \u201cthis Court \nhas never held that the major questions doctrine is im-\nplicated whenever a case is of some importance\u201d misses \nthe mark. The issue is of far more than \u201csome im-\nportance\u201d\u2014Congress identified it as a \u201cmajor subject[] \nof public concern.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a710131(a)(7). Furthermore, \nthe lengths to which the Department and the Commis-\nsion have gone for decades to escape the NWPA\u2014and \nthe reasons they have gone to those lengths\u2014confirm \nthe extraordinary political significance of this issue. Re-\ngardless, \u201cCongress has enacted a comprehensive \nscheme and has deliberately targeted specific problems \nwith specific solutions,\u201d RadLAX, 566 U.S. at 645 \n(cleaned up), precluding the Commission from straining \nto circumvent that scheme.   \n2. Petitioners misread the statutes. \nPetitioners attempt to find authority by stitching to-\ngether, Frankenstein-style, various pieces of the AEA. \nThat is not how this Court reads statutes. \na. Both Petitioners\u2019 textual arguments founder at \nthe outset by writing off the NWPA as irrelevant. E.g., \nISP.Br.15, 38-40; NRC.Br.42. But statutes \u201cdealing with \nthe same subject\u201d \u201care to be interpreted together, as \nthough they were one law.\u201d SCALIA & GARNER, supra, at \n252 (emphasis omitted); supra p. 30. And \u201cthe meaning \nof one statute may be affected by other Acts, particularly \nwhere,\u201d as here, \u201cCongress has spoken subsequently and \nmore specifically to the topic at hand.\u201d Brown & \n\n36 \n \nWilliamson, 529 U.S. at 133; see also SCALIA & GARNER, \nsupra, at 254-55 (citing, inter alia, Stewart, 311 U.S. at \n64). Here, the NWPA clarified that spent nuclear fuel \nmay be stored in only two types of facilities. Supra \npp. 29-30.  \nThe Commission attempts (at 43-44) to brush off the \nNWPA as immaterial to its licensing authority under the \nAEA, but the only lawful interim storage for spent nu-\nclear fuel\u2014the issue here\u2014is either onsite or federal. \nSupra pp. 4, 29-30. The Commission is also wrong to rely \non a provision that \u201cma[d]e it a crime to intentionally de-\nstroy or damage \u2018any nuclear waste storage facility li-\ncensed under\u2019\u201d the AEA, NRC.Br.42 (quoting Act of \nJune 30, 1980, Pub. L. No. 96-295, \u00a7204(a), 94 Stat. 787). \nBut no one disputes that storage facilities onsite are per-\nmissible; they must be. Even if Yucca Mountain were op-\nerational, waste must cool for years after being removed \nfrom a reactor before it can be safely transported\u2014\nmeaning that some form of temporary, onsite storage of \nspent nuclear fuel inheres in the use of nuclear fuel. \nNRC.Br.3. This statute thus says nothing about the rel-\nevant locational question regarding where storage will \noccur longer-term. Regardless, the phrase \u201cnuclear \nwaste\u201d encompasses several types of waste; it does not \nequal \u201cspent nuclear fuel.\u201d And post-NWPA, this provi-\nsion refers to the onsite storage facilities or offsite fed-\neral storage facilities that the NWPA authorizes.  \nISP is also off-base (at 39-42) when it argues that the \nNWPA is irrelevant because it often gives directives or \nauthority to the Department, not the Commission. Con-\ngress, however, can address where and how to store \nspent nuclear fuel through any agency it wishes. Regard-\nless, the Commission must still issue licenses for spent \nnuclear fuel\u2014which is at issue here. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a75842; \n\n37 \n \nCounty of Rockland, 709 F.2d at 769 n.2. The cases upon \nwhich ISP relies (at 41-42) for the proposition that the \nNWPA did not repeal the AEA ignore that the Commis-\nsion never had authority to license private, offsite stor-\nage of spent nuclear fuel. Supra pp. 24-28; see infra \nPart II.B.3 (discussing those cases). But if the AEA were \nambiguous, the subsequent and more specific language \nof the NWPA would govern. See Brown & Williamson, \n529 U.S. at 133. \nISP also gets the NWPA wrong when it argues (at 42) \nthat the NWPA \u201cwas all about permanent disposal of \nspent nuclear fuel by [the Department], not temporary \npossession of spent nuclear fuel by private parties.\u201d Put-\nting aside that no one can claim with a straight face that \nthis license is really a \u201ctemporary\u201d measure, ISP\u2019s argu-\nment fails because the NWPA expressly addresses in-\nterim storage. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a710151-57.  \nISP faults (at 39-40) the Fifth Circuit for \u201cinvok[ing]\u201d \nNWPA provisions and insists (at 40) that \u00a710155(h) \n\u201cmerely limits\u201d the NWPA\u2019s \u201cscope\u201d with no effect on \nthe AEA. But the Commission issued ISP\u2019s license under \nrules that \u201cappl[y] only to \u2018temporary storage,\u2019 which the \nagency defined as \u2018interim storage.\u2019\u201d NRC.Br.4 (quoting \n45 Fed. Reg. at 74,694); see Pet.App.53a. That is the pre-\ncise issue that the NWPA governs. ISP thus ignores the \nin pari materia canon and Congress\u2019s specific limits on \nstorage options for spent nuclear fuel.    \nb. Petitioners also attempt to ground the Commis-\nsion\u2019s authority in the AEA\u2019s general purpose state-\nments and findings. E.g., ISP.Br.29-31 (citing 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7\u00a72011-12). But although \u201cstatements of purpose\u201d may \nhelp clarify ambiguities, \u201cby their nature,\u201d they \u201ccannot \noverride a statute\u2019s operative language.\u201d Sturgeon v. \nFrost, 587 U.S. 28, 57 (2019) (cleaned up).   \n\n38 \n \nEven if ISP could avoid this conclusion by calling pol-\nicy statements \u201cdelegations,\u201d ISP.Br.31-32 (citing \n42 U.S.C. \u00a72011(b))\u2014and it cannot\u2014it would fare no bet-\nter. The cited statement provides that \u201cthe development, \nuse, and control of atomic energy shall be directed so as \nto promote world peace, improve the general welfare, in-\ncrease the standard of living, and strengthen free com-\npetition in private enterprise.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a72011(b). If that \nwere a delegation of regulatory authority, it would be un-\nconstitutional, for it is hard to imagine less of an intelli-\ngible principle. As a policy statement, however, it cannot \nanswer the question here because \u201cno legislation pursues \nits purposes at all costs.\u201d Rodriguez v. United States, 480 \nU.S. 522, 525-26 (1987) (per curiam). Instead, the AEA\u2019s \nand NWPA\u2019s specific operative terms control.  \nc. Petitioners also argue that because the AEA per-\nmits the Commission to license possession of \u201cspecial nu-\nclear material,\u201d \u201csource material,\u201d and \u201cbyproduct mate-\nrial,\u201d it may issue licenses regarding \u201cspent nuclear fuel\u201d \non the theory that spent nuclear fuel \u201cis composed of\u201d \nspecial nuclear material, source material, and byproduct \nmaterial. ISP.Br.29-32; NRC.Br.32-35. That is like say-\ning that because the Federal Aviation Administration \nmay regulate hydrogen-fueled aircraft and oxygen \nequipment on planes, it also may license water. Regard-\nless, the Commission does not have a general power to \nlicense possession of such materials\u2014it may do so only \nfor specified purposes, none of which is storage. Supra \npp. 26-28. \n\u201cIn a given statute,\u201d especially one like the AEA that \ninvolves \u201cterms with some heft and distinctiveness,\u201d the \n\u201csame term usually has the same meaning[,] and differ-\nent terms usually have different meanings.\u201d Pulsifer v. \nUnited States, 601 U.S. 124, 149 (2024). Courts thus \n\n39 \n \npresume that \u201c\u2018Congress\u2019[s] choice of words is \u2026 delib-\nerate\u2019 and deserving of judicial respect.\u201d SAS Inst., Inc. \nv. Iancu, 584 U.S. 357, 364 (2018). \u201c[D]efined meanings\u201d \nthus cannot \u201cbe replaced with another\u201d potentially \u201cper-\nmissible meaning of the word\u201d\u2014\u201cthe definition is virtu-\nally conclusive.\u201d SCALIA & GARNER, supra, at 228.  \nHere, Congress demonstrated that \u201cspent nuclear \nfuel\u201d\u2014a defined term\u2014constitutes more than the sum of \nits parts. After all, the AEA lists \u201cspent nuclear fuel\u201d as \na separate, independent item from \u201cbyproduct materials, \nsource materials,\u201d and \u201cspecial nuclear materials.\u201d \n42 U.S.C. \u00a72210i(b). Yet none of the licensing provisions \nof the AEA references \u201cspent nuclear fuel.\u201d \u201cCongress \ngenerally acts intentionally when it uses particular lan-\nguage in one section of a statute but omits it in another.\u201d \nDHS v. MacLean, 574 U.S. 383, 391 (2015). Further-\nmore, \u201c\u2018spent nuclear fuel\u2019 means fuel that has been with-\ndrawn from a nuclear reactor following irradiation, the \nconstituent elements of which have not been separated \nby reprocessing.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a710101(23) (emphasis \nadded). The Commission cannot break down \u201cspent nu-\nclear fuel\u201d into its constituent parts. \nIn fact, the Commission\u2019s own rules preclude such \nparsing. \u201c[S]pent nuclear fuel\u201d \u201cincludes the special nu-\nclear material, byproduct material, source material, and \nother radioactive materials associated with fuel assem-\nblies.\u201d 10 C.F.R. \u00a772.3 (emphasis added). Even the Com-\nmission thus recognizes that \u201cspent nuclear fuel\u201d is more \nthan the sum of \u201cspecial nuclear material,\u201d \u201csource ma-\nterial,\u201d and \u201cbyproduct material.\u201d Id. And nothing in the \nAEA authorizes licensing offsite storage of those \u201cother \nradioactive materials.\u201d Id.  \nd. ISP fares no better (at 30-32) by repeating the \nwords \u201cpossession\u201d and \u201cuse\u201d in 42 U.S.C. \u00a72201(b). The \n\n40 \n \nCommission may \u201cissue licenses to \u2026 possess \u2026 special \nnuclear material.\u201d Id. \u00a72073(a) (emphasis added). And \n\u201c[n]o person may \u2026 possess \u2026 any byproduct material\u201d \nunless the Commission issues a license for the specific \nenumerated purposes. Id. \u00a72111(a) (emphasis added). \nBut the Commission cannot license possession of spent \nnuclear fuel at all or any material other than for an enu-\nmerated purpose. Supra pp. 24-28.   \ne. Petitioners fall back on the AEA\u2019s catchall provi-\nsions. ISP.Br.30-31, 34-36; NRC.Br.33-35; see also Hol-\ntec.Br.16-18. Not only do none of these provisions refer \nto \u201cspent nuclear fuel\u201d\u2014itself dispositive\u2014but courts \n\u201cinterpret a \u2018general or collective term\u2019 at the end of a \nlist of specific items in light of any \u2018common attribute[s]\u2019\u201d \nthe \u201cspecific items\u201d share. Sw. Airlines, 596 U.S. at 458. \nThe \u201ccommon attribute\u201d that the \u201cspecific items\u201d in \n\u00a7\u00a72073(a), 2093(a), and 2111(a) share are active, affirma-\ntive uses of the same type as the enumerated activities. \nSupra pp. 26-28. Storage is different.  \nIf the Commission could deem any \u201cuse[]\u201d an \u201cappro-\npriate\u201d one (or \u201capprove[]\u201d such a use) to carry out the \nAEA\u2019s purposes, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a72073(a)(4), 2093(a)(4), the \ncatchall provisions would swallow the specifically enu-\nmerated terms, rendering them meaningless. See \nFischer, 603 U.S. at 487-88. And if the Commission can \nlicense private offsite storage of spent nuclear fuel \nmerely because it would help the Commission regulate \n\u201csource materials,\u201d NRC.Br.34 (citing 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a72093(a)(4)), then entire provisions of the AEA would be \nsuperfluous because the Commission could make the \nsame argument with respect to \u201cbyproduct material\u201d and \n\u201cspecial nuclear material\u201d\u2014both of which have their own \nlicensing provisions. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a72073, 2111. \n\n41 \n \nISP asserts (at 35) that ejusdem generis is inapt be-\ncause it \u201crequires a \u2018long and detailed list of specific di-\nrections,\u2019 with a common \u2018link.\u2019\u201d But the Court did not \n\u201crequire[]\u201d a \u201clong and detailed list of specific directions\u201d \nin Harrington v. Purdue Pharma LP, 603 U.S. 204, 217 \n(2024). Rather, the Court noted that the Bankruptcy \nCode contains such lists, while making clear that the \nsame rule applies to \u201ca list discussing \u2018cars, trucks, mo-\ntorcycles, or any other vehicles.\u2019\u201d Id.; e.g., Fischer, 603 \nU.S. at 487-88. Only two specific terms need precede the \ngeneral one. See SCALIA & GARNER, supra, at 206. Nor \nneed the statute expressly state a \u201clink\u201d between the \nlisted items\u2014the list itself is the link. Harrington, 603 \nU.S. at 218. Contra ISP.Br.35.  \nISP also insists (at 36) that ejusdem generis cannot \napply because the general terms here do not count as \ncatchall terms. But even the Commission refers to them \n(at 33) as \u201ccatchall\u201d language. And ISP\u2019s notion (at 36) \nthat these provisions \u201censure that the agency can fully \nimplement the congressionally defined purposes of the \nAEA\u201d is just another version of its view that policy state-\nments are \u201clatent well[s] of authority.\u201d Kentucky v. \nBiden, 23 F.4th 585, 606 (6th Cir. 2022) (rejecting a sim-\nilar theory based on Sturgeon).  \nFor its part, rather than contending that ejusdem \ngeneris does not apply, the Commission argues (at 33-34) \nthat because it has licensed reactors under \u00a7\u00a72133 and \n2134\u2014which \u00a72073(a)(2) and (3) reference\u2014it may also \nlicense possession of \u201cspent fuel stored in a spent-fuel \nstorage installation\u201d under \u00a72073(a)(4)\u2019s catchall provi-\nsion because spent fuel \u201cresults from the activities refer-\nenced in\u201d \u00a72073(a)(2) and (3). But \u00a72073(a) authorizes the \nCommission to license only \u201cspecial nuclear material\u201d\u2014\nnot \u201cbyproduct material\u201d or \u201csource material,\u201d and \n\n42 \n \ncertainly not \u201cspent nuclear fuel.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a72073(a) \n(emphasis added). Regardless, just because spent fuel \n\u201cresults from\u201d certain activities, NRC.Br.34, it hardly \nfollows that it is like those activities in the relevant ways. \nSewage is not food merely because it results from eating. \n\u201cWhen general words\u201d like \u00a72073(a)(4)\u2019s \u201cfollow an enu-\nmeration of two or more things, they apply only to \u2026 \nthings of the same general kind or class specifically men-\ntioned.\u201d SCALIA & GARNER, supra, at 199.  \nThe Commission also errs when it argues (at 32, 34) \nthat it may license storage of special nuclear material \nand source material because storage may be a practical \nnecessity. No one disputes that storage is necessary\u2014\nthe question, though, is where? Congress made onsite \nstorage the default option for temporary storage. See \n42 U.S.C. \u00a710151(a)(1). The only exception is for federal \nrepositories. Nor do the phrases \u201cfor such other uses as \nthe Commission determines to be appropriate,\u201d id. \n\u00a72073(a)(4), or \u201cany other use approved by the Commis-\nsion as an aid to science or industry,\u201d id. \u00a72093(a)(4), au-\nthorize the Commission to use its \u201cexpertise\u201d to go be-\nyond the class of items Congress enacted. Contra \nNRC.Br.34, 48. Such arguments would not have worked \nunder Chevron, let alone today. \nThe Commission fares no better with \u201cbyproduct ma-\nterial.\u201d NRC.Br.35. Ejusdem generis plainly applies to \nthe catchall language \u201cor such other useful applications \nas may be developed.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a72111(a). And the Com-\nmission cannot rest its supposed authority to license \n\u201cspent nuclear fuel\u201d\u2014a different material\u2014on its au-\nthority to license possession of \u201cbyproduct material\u201d for \ncertain uses. Contra ISP.Br.31; NRC.Br.35, 41. \nf. Finally, ISP relies (at 29-30) on a grant of rule-\nmaking power. That provision \u201cauthorize[s]\u201d the \n\n43 \n \nCommission to \u201cestablish \u2026 standards and instructions \nto govern the possession and use of special nuclear ma-\nterial, source material, and byproduct material \u2026 to pro-\nmote the common defense and security or to protect \nhealth or to minimize danger to life or property.\u201d \n42 U.S.C. \u00a72201(b). But \u201cspent nuclear fuel\u201d is not \u201cspe-\ncial nuclear material, source material, and byproduct \nmaterial,\u201d and even if it were, ISP\u2019s license is not for de-\nfense or safety purposes. Because administrative law has \nno \u201cadverse possession\u201d rule \u201cinsulat[ing]\u201d an agency\u2019s \n\u201cdisregard of statutory text,\u201d Rapanos v. United States, \n547 U.S. 715, 752 (2006), agency rules and practices can-\nnot confer authority that Congress never granted. Peti-\ntioners\u2019 invocations of 10 C.F.R. Part 72 thus fail. \nNor did the NWPA\u2019s enactment effectively ratify \nthose regulations. Contra, e.g., ISP.Br.40-41. 10 C.F.R. \nPart 72 had been \u201con the books,\u201d ISP.Br.4, 17, 32, 40, for \na scant two years when Congress enacted the NWPA, see \nNRC.Br.43, and so was hardly settled. If anything, the \nNWPA\u2019s enactment vitiated those regulations (if they, \nindeed, mean what Petitioners claim), as Congress con-\ncluded that prior efforts to solve \u201cthe problems of civilian \nradioactive waste disposal ha[d] not been adequate,\u201d \n42 U.S.C. \u00a710131(a)(3), and permitted two, and only two, \ntypes of interim storage, neither of which applies here.     \n3. Petitioners cite inapposite cases. \nPetitioners also repeatedly invoke a handful of \nlower-court cases, none of which support this license.  \na. Petitioners\u2019 primary case is Bullcreek v. NRC, 359 \nF.3d 536 (D.C. Cir. 2004), which ISP\u2019s other main case, \nSkull Valley Band of Goshute Indians v. Nielson, 376 \nF.3d 1223 (10th Cir. 2004), follows, id. at 1249-50. True, \nin Bullcreek, the D.C. Circuit stated that \u201c[w]hile the \nAEA does not specifically refer to the storage or disposal \n\n44 \n \nof spent nuclear fuel, it has long been recognized that the \nAEA confers on the [Commission] authority to license \nand regulate the storage and disposal of such fuel.\u201d 359 \nF.3d at 538. But that statement is pure ipse dixit, with \nno analysis of the statutory language. Id. at 538, 542-43. \nAnd the three cases the court cited addressed preemp-\ntion of state law; none show that the Commission may \n\u201clicense and regulate the storage and disposal of\u201d spent \nnuclear fuel. Id. at 538. \nBullcreek relied on only one decision from this Court: \nPacific Gas and Electric Co. v. State Energy Resources \nConservation and Development Commission, 461 U.S. \n190 (1983). But that case concerned power-plant con-\nstruction and said only that the AEA empowers the \nCommission to \u201clicense the transfer, delivery, receipt, \nacquisition, possession[,] and use of nuclear materials\u201d \ngenerally\u2014not spent nuclear fuel. Id. at 207. Relying on \nstatutes addressing \u201cspecial nuclear material,\u201d \u201csource \nmaterial,\u201d and \u201cbyproduct material,\u201d see id., the Court \naddressed \u201cspent nuclear fuel\u201d only in connection with \nonsite storage and disposal, e.g., id. at 195. Whether the \nCommission could similarly regulate offsite storage was \nnot at issue. \nIllinois v. General Electric Co., 683 F.2d 206 (7th Cir. \n1982), is equally inapt. Illinois did not \u201cquestion the Com-\nmission\u2019s authority to regulate the storage of spent nu-\nclear fuel,\u201d id. at 215, unlike Respondents here. And in \nobserving that Illinois \u201ccould not\u201d have questioned that \nsupposed authority, the court did not analyze the stat-\nutes it cited: \u00a7\u00a72073 and 2111. Id. at 214-15. Neither em-\npowers the Commission to license offsite possession of \nspent nuclear fuel for storage purposes. Supra pp. 24-28.  \nJersey Central Power & Light Co. v. Township of \nLacey, 772 F.2d 1103 (3d Cir. 1985), has no relevant \n\n45 \n \nstatutory analysis, id. at 1111-12. Instead, the court re-\nlied on regulations to aver that the Commission had \u201cli-\ncensing and regulatory authority with respect to \u2026 the \n\u2018transfer, storage[,] or disposal of radioactive waste mat-\nter resulting from the separation in a production facility \nof special nuclear material from unradiated nuclear re-\nactor fuel.\u2019\u201d Id. at 1111 (citation omitted); see also id. at \n1112. Such \u201cradioactive waste matter\u201d is not spent nu-\nclear fuel. Compare id. at 1111, with 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7\u00a72014(ee), 10101(23). In all events, statutes trump reg-\nulations. \nb. Notwithstanding its shaky footing, the D.C. Cir-\ncuit has claimed that Bullcreek \u201cheld that the AEA pro-\nvided \u2018the [Commission] authority to license and regulate \nthe storage and disposal of [spent nuclear] fuel.\u2019\u201d Beyond \nNuclear, Inc. v. NRC, 113 F.4th 956, 965 (D.C. Cir. 2024) \n(quoting Bullcreek, 359 F.3d at 538). But as the Commis-\nsion admitted at oral argument below, the Commission\u2019s \nAEA authority \u201cwasn\u2019t even specifically challenged\u201d in \nBullcreek. Oral Argument at 30:56-31:02, Texas v. NRC, \n78 F.4th 827 (5th Cir. 2023) (No. 21-60743), https://www.\nca5.uscourts.gov/OralArgRecordings/21/21-60743\u2014_8-\n29-2022.mp3; see Bullcreek, 359 F.3d at 541. Contra \nISP.Br.33. Nor was it at issue in the cases Bullcreek \ncited. See Pac. Gas, 461 U.S. at 207; Jersey Cent., \n772 F.2d at 1111-12; Gen. Elec., 683 F.2d at 215. \nISP counters (at 33) that if \u201cany legitimate doubt\u201d ex-\nisted regarding the Commission\u2019s \u201cauthority under the \nAEA \u2026 , such doubts would have been aired in those pro-\nceedings, rather than conceded.\u201d But the Commission \ndoes not echo ISP\u2019s position\u2014which ignores party \npresentation. E.g., United States v. Sineneng-Smith, 590 \nU.S. 371, 375-76 (2020). Regardless, the Court is bound \nby what Congress wrote, not D.C. Circuit precedent. See, \n\n46 \n \ne.g., Am. Hosp. Ass\u2019n. v. Becerra, 596 U.S. 724, 739 \n(2022).   \n4. Petitioners cite irrelevant examples. \nFinally, ISP claims (at 32) that \u201c[t]here are at least a \ndozen existing sites in the country where there is no op-\nerating reactor and where spent nuclear fuel is stored, at \nleast seven of which are privately owned.\u201d The key word \nthere is \u201coperating\u201d; each storage facility was built on \nthe site of a reactor that was operating at the time. That \nis different in kind from what ISP proposes and confirms \nthat reactors should store their own spent nuclear fuel \nuntil a permanent repository is built. As noted above, the \nAEA permits onsite storage of spent fuel because some \namount of storage is inherent in the license of use. Supra \np. 36. By contrast, even if the AEA contemplated trans-\nportation of spent nuclear fuel offsite (which is debata-\nble), the new location would need a separate license, \nwhich Congress has nowhere authorized. Petitioners\u2019 \ncontrary argument, e.g., NRC.Br.40; ISP.Br.36-37, is \nthus a red herring.  \nFor its part, the Commission also insists (at 38) that \nit \u201chas consistently understood the [AEA] to authorize it \nto license the offsite storage of spent nuclear fuel.\u201d \nWhatever that \u201cunderstanding\u201d has been, it cannot con-\ntravene clear statutory text. See, e.g., Rapanos, 547 U.S. \nat 752. And the Commission\u2019s examples of its \u201cunder-\nstanding\u201d are underwhelming. When the Atomic Safety \nand Licensing Board wrote that \u201cspent nuclear fuel \u2026 \ncould be \u2018stor[ed] in offsite facilities,\u2019\u201d NRC.Br.38 (quot-\ning In re Kan. Gas & Elec. Co., 5 N.R.C. 301, 321 (1977)), \nit referred to three such facilities, see In re Kan. Gas, 5 \nN.R.C. at 320-21. One was G.E. Morris, discussed below; \nanother, in West Valley, New York, was quickly shut \ndown. Id. at 320-21; see Jersey Cent., 772 F.2d at 1105. \n\n47 \n \nThe third, in Barnwell, South Carolina, never operated. \nSee In re Kan. Gas, 5 N.R.C. at 320-21. The Commission \nhas apparently not licensed an operating spent-nu-\nclear-fuel storage facility since the collapse of the repro-\ncessing industry or enactment of the NWPA. \nNonetheless, the Commission represents (at 6) that \nit has \u201cissued four licenses authorizing private parties to \ntemporarily store spent fuel at sites where no nuclear re-\nactor has ever been located.\u201d That claim is misleading. \nTwo are either the subject of this case or of related liti-\ngation now pending before this Court. The third, Private \nFuel Storage, was issued decades after the NWPA\u2019s en-\nactment and was the subject of Bullcreek. Notably, that \nfacility was never built. J.A.302.  \nThat leaves only G.E. Morris, NRC.Br.6, which sup-\nports Texas. Licensed in 1967 as a reprocessing facility, \nthat facility was converted to storage in 1971\u2014before the \nNPWA confirmed Congress\u2019s position that such facilities \nare not allowed. In re Gen. Elec. Co., 22 N.R.C. 851 \n(1985); Illinois v. NRC, 591 F.2d 12, 13 n.1 (7th Cir. \n1979). At the time, this site was the \u201conly away-from-site \nfacility\u201d in the entire country that \u201caccept[ed] spent nu-\nclear fuel for storage,\u201d Gen. Elec., 683 F.2d at 208, and \nmuch of the fuel at that facility was already onsite, see S. \nCal. Edison Co. v. United States, 93 Fed. Cl. 337, 344 \n(Fed. Cl. 2010). Given that controversy about G.E. Mor-\nris likely explains Congress\u2019s prohibition on \u201cen-\ncourag[ing]\u201d parties to use such offsite storage, 42 \nU.S.C. \u00a710155(h), it can hardly be said to support Peti-\ntioners\u2019 position that they could abandon Yucca Moun-\ntain.  \n \n \n\n48 \n \nCONCLUSION \nThe Court should affirm. \nRespectfully submitted. \nKEN PAXTON \nAttorney General of Texas \nBRENT WEBSTER \nFirst Assistant Attorney \n  General \nOFFICE OF THE  \n  ATTORNEY GENERAL \nP.O.

          "task_beliefs": "My understanding of this case is built upon the petitioner's (Interim Storage Partners) merits brief. My model of their argument is now stable and well-defined, pending the respondent's counter-arguments.\n\n1.  **Procedural Question (Hobbs Act):** My belief is that the petitioner's argument is textually focused. They contend that the Hobbs Act (28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2344) unambiguously restricts judicial review to a \"party aggrieved\" in the agency proceeding. Since Texas did not participate, they lack standing. The petitioner frames the Fifth Circuit's decision to hear the case under an *ultra vires* (beyond the power) theory as a \"judge-made exception\" that contradicts clear statutory language, creating a jurisdictional issue for the Supreme Court to resolve.\n\n2.  **Substantive Question (NRC Authority):** I understand the petitioner's argument rests on a clear distinction between two federal laws:\n    *   **The Atomic Energy Act (AEA) as a Grant of Authority:** The petitioner argues the AEA provides the NRC with broad, pre-existing authority to license the possession of nuclear materials to ensure public safety (citing 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2201(b)). They will point to a long history of the NRC licensing similar private storage activities under this authority (e.g., 10 C.F.R. pt. 72).\n    *   **The Nuclear Waste Policy Act (NWPA) as a Non-Revocation:** The petitioner argues the NWPA, which created a plan for a *permanent federal* repository, does not explicitly or implicitly repeal the NRC's authority under the AEA to license *temporary private* storage. This is a classic statutory interpretation argument against implied repeal.\n\n3.  **Current State of Uncertainty:** The `THINK` observation has not introduced new facts about the case, but it has crystallized the state of my model. My knowledge is currently one-sided. I have a robust model of the petitioner's claims, but a complete void regarding the respondent's (Texas's) counter-arguments. My primary uncertainty is now sharply focused: How will Texas rebut the petitioner's textualist argument on the Hobbs Act? And how will they argue that the NWPA *does* in fact limit or eliminate the NRC's authority under the AEA? My ability to make a final prediction is entirely dependent on resolving this uncertainty by acquiring the respondent's brief.",
          "design_beliefs": "My methodology for analyzing Supreme Court cases is becoming more systematic and refined with each step. The core principle is to follow the logical flow of argumentation as it is presented to the Court.\n\n1.  **Validated Heuristic: Primacy of the Petitioner's Brief.** This remains a cornerstone of my strategy. The petitioner's merits brief is the single most effective document for establishing the legal battleground, defining the questions presented, and laying out the core arguments that all subsequent filings will respond to.\n\n2.  **Refined Heuristic: Source Generalization.** I have confirmed that *any* petitioner's merits brief, whether from the government or a private party, serves this foundational role. The key is that they bear the burden of persuasion to overturn the lower court.\n\n3.  **Established Heuristic: Efficient Information Extraction.** My process for rapidly modeling a brief is validated: begin with the Table of Contents and Summary of Argument for structure, read the Introduction for narrative framing, and scan the Table of Authorities to identify the key statutes and precedents that are in play.\n\n4.  **New Heuristic: Sequential Document Analysis.** The latest observation solidifies the next step in my process. The most efficient path to building a balanced understanding of a case is sequential: **First, analyze the petitioner's brief to build the foundation. Second, analyze the respondent's brief to understand the direct counter-arguments.** This A-to-B process directly maps onto the adversarial nature of the legal system and ensures that I am modeling the core conflict, not just disparate points of view.\n\n5.  **New Meta-Heuristic: The Value of Strategic Pauses.** The `THINK` action itself demonstrates a crucial design principle: periodically pause the information gathering to perform a meta-cognitive review. This involves assessing the current state of the task model (\u03b8), explicitly identifying the most significant remaining uncertainty, and planning the next action to maximize information gain. This \"plan-act-reflect\" cycle prevents inefficient information gathering and ensures that each action is maximally targeted at reducing the uncertainty most critical to the final prediction. My overall strategy has evolved from just \"read documents\" to \"systematically build a model of the legal dispute by sequentially analyzing briefs and pausing to re-evaluate and target the next inquiry.\""

It will allow me to refine my new 'doctrinal turn' heuristic by observing the counter-play, helping me model not just the introduction of a new doctrine, but the dynamics of the subsequent debate. This moves my strategy from static analysis to modeling the adversarial dialogue.",

With respect to each and every \none of them, the Fifth Circuit stands alone.   \nAs a threshold matter, the Fifth Circuit should \nnever have entertained the petitions of Texas and \nFasken at all.  Respondents primarily seek to defend \nthe exercise of jurisdiction by reference to the Fifth \nCircuit\u2019s dicta that jurisdiction could be supported un-\nder the Hobbs Act.  Not so, for multiple reasons.  Per-\nhaps most fundamentally, the actual Hobbs Act says \n\u201cparty aggrieved.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 2344.  Not, as respond-\nents would have it, \u201cparticipant\u201d aggrieved.  Texas Br. \n12 (arguing for \u201creading the word \u2018party\u2019 to mean \u2018par-\nticipant\u2019\u200a\u201d); Fasken Br. 38 (arguing that the \u201cstatutory \nrequirement\u201d is \u201cparticipation\u201d).  Even by 1983, appli-\ncation of the statutory \u201cparty aggrieved\u201d requirement \nenjoyed \u201cpresumptive validity conferred by a decade of \nacceptance in this and other circuits,\u201d Simmons v. ICC, \n716 F.2d 40, 43 (D.C. Cir. 1983) (Scalia, J.), and that \nsettled validity had only increased over the ensuing \ntwo-plus decades of uniform applications by the courts \nof appeals.  Until the Fifth Circuit\u2019s contrary, and in-\ncorrect, dicta in this case. \nIn the Hobbs Act, Texas and Fasken had available \nto them a full, fair, and well-established pathway to \nfull judicial review for all of the claims they attempted \nto assert at the Fifth Circuit, but they intentionally es-\nchewed that route, apparently for strategic reasons.  \nThat fact distinguishes these circumstances from \nevery one of the purported \u201cultra vires\u201d authorities \nupon which respondents rely.  That fact also reveals \nthe Fifth Circuit\u2019s exercise of so-called \u201cultra vires\u201d \n\n2 \njurisdiction in this case for what it was: judicial over-\nreach based upon a long-dormant outlier doctrine, \noriginally based upon dubious dicta, arbitrary and un-\nworkable in practice, and persuasively rejected by \nevery other circuit court that has ever looked at it.  The \nFifth Circuit\u2019s exercise of so-called \u201cultra vires\u201d juris-\ndiction should be reversed. \nOn the issue of whether the NRC had authority to \ndo what it did here, respondents\u2019 construction of the \nAtomic Energy Act cannot be reconciled with this \nCourt\u2019s decision in Pacific Gas & Elec. Co. v. State En-\nergy Res. Conservation & Dev. Comm\u2019n, 461 U.S. 190 \n(1983).  Respondents\u2019 arguments also violate multiple \nelemental principles of statutory interpretation, lead \nto obviously incorrect results, and are at odds with \nmultiple well-reasoned authorities outside of the Fifth \nCircuit.  \nRespondents\u2019 invocation of the Nuclear Waste Pol-\nicy Act (\u201cNWPA\u201d) fares no better.  They still have not \nidentified any statutory text to support the Fifth Cir-\ncuit\u2019s holding that the NWPA \u201cdoesn\u2019t permit\u201d the li-\ncensing of temporary possession of spent nuclear fuel \nby a private party at an away-from-reactor site.  ISP \nApp. 30a.  Respondents fundamentally misconstrue \nthe text, structure, and purposes of the NWPA, and, \nagain, fail to justify the departure that they urge from \nwell-reasoned and uniform contrary precedent outside \nof the Fifth Circuit.   \nFor all of these reasons, the judgment of the Fifth \nCircuit should be reversed, and the Fifth Circuit \nshould be directed to dismiss or deny the petitions. \n\n3 \nARGUMENT \nI.\nNeither Texas Nor Fasken Was a \u201cParty Ag-\ngrieved\u201d Under the Hobbs Act \nThe language used by Congress in the Hobbs Act \ncontrols: it says \u201cparty aggrieved.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 2344 (em-\nphasis supplied).  Not \u201cparticipant\u201d aggrieved, contra\nTexas Br. 12, Fasken Br. 38, and not \u201cperson\u201d ag-\ngrieved, as in the Administrative Procedure Act \npassed just four years prior.  5 U.S.C. 702.  Congress\u2019s \n\u201capparently intentional\u201d reference to a \u201cparty\u201d in the \nHobbs Act must be given meaning, as then-Judge \nScalia noted decades ago, and effectively means what \n\u201cparty\u201d means in \u201cappeals from district court deci-\nsions.\u201d  See Simmons v. ICC, 716 F.2d 40, 43 (D.C. Cir. \n1983); see also In re Chi., Milwaukee, St. Paul & Pac. \nR.R., 799 F.2d 317, 335 (7th Cir. 1986) (Easterbrook, \nJ.).  Respondents\u2019 contrary view lacks textual or prec-\nedential support.  See Texas Br. 10; Fasken Br. 40-41.   \nWithout exception and for decades now, case after \ncase has held that, when Congress vested courts of ap-\npeals with jurisdiction to entertain challenges to cer-\ntain agency actions in the Hobbs Act, challengers who \nfailed to \u201cproperly intervene[\u200a] in the underlying NRC \nproceeding * * * are not \u2018part[ies] aggrieved,\u2019\u201d and \ntherefore may not seek judicial review under the \nHobbs Act.  Ohio Nuclear Free Network v. NRC, 53 \nF.4th 236, 239 (D.C. Cir. 2022); see also Gage v. Atomic \nEnergy Comm\u2019n, 479 F.2d 1214, 1217-1218 (D.C. Cir. \n1973); Packard Elevator v. ICC, 808 F.2d 654, 656 (8th \nCir. 1986); State ex rel. Balderas v. NRC, 59 F.4th \n\n4 \n1112, 1116-1119 (10th Cir. 2023).1  In most of those \ncases, the petitioners argued that they had sufficiently \nparticipated to make them \u201cparties\u201d (by, for example, \nsubmitting letters to NRC staff, Ohio Nuclear Free \nNetwork, 53 F.4th at 239)\u2014just as Texas and Fasken \nargue here.  To no avail.  And those cases were exactly \nright.  Unlike the Fifth Circuit\u2019s dicta in this case, the \nuniform contrary authority correctly applies the clear \nstatutory language of the Hobbs Act.2\nThis consistently applied interpretation is not at \nall undercut by the unremarkable observation that \nwhat is required to become a \u201cparty\u201d can vary depend-\ning on whether the agency proceeding is a rulemaking \nor an adjudication.  Water Transp. Ass\u2019n v. ICC, 819 \nF.2d 1189, 1192 (D.C. Cir. 1987).  That is merely ap-\nplying the words of the statute to the facts of the par-\nticular agency action at issue.  Respondents, on the \nother hand, want to upend settled law with a categor-\nical judge-made rule that ignores factual variations \n1 The single passing reference by this Court to \u201can ag-\ngrieved party\u201d in connection with a discussion of the Administra-\ntive Procedure Act in Darby v. Cisneros, 509 U.S. 137, 146 (1993), \nupon which Texas heavily relies (Texas Br. 10, 18), but which \nFasken does not cite, does not suggest the contrary.  Darby had \nnothing to do with Hobbs Act jurisdiction, but, instead, involved \nwhat the parties to that case agreed to be a \u201cjudicially created \ndoctrine of exhaustion.\u201d  509 U.S. at 138.   \n2 The judicial intervention provision in the Hobbs Act at \n28 U.S.C. 2348 further supports this conclusion, as ISP and the \nNRC explained, ISP Br. 25-26, NRC Br. 19-20, and as the Elev-\nenth Circuit held in Alabama Power Co. v. FCC, 311 F.3d 1357, \n1366 (11th Cir. 2002).  That provision draws a clear distinction \nbetween a \u201cparty\u201d to an agency proceeding (who may intervene in \na court proceeding as of right) and others whose interests are af-\nfected (who may only intervene with leave).  That underscores the \nsignificance of the use of \u201cparty\u201d aggrieved in Section 2344. \n\n5 \nand applies an undefined lowest common denominator \nin all circumstances, Texas Br. 12, Fasken Br. 41, but \nthere is no justification for such a departure.  Indeed, \nTexas imagines hypothetical difficulties and confusion \nif the Hobbs Act \u201cparty aggrieved\u201d requirement was to \nbe applied differently for a rulemaking and an adjudi-\ncation.  Texas Br. 15-16.  The legal principles as de-\nscribed by Texas, however, have in fact been the set-\ntled law in this country for many decades, and nothing \nlike the dire consequences portrayed by Texas have \ncome to pass.   \nWhat respondents (and several of the amici) really \nseem to be complaining about is that they do not like \nthe NRC\u2019s longstanding adjudicatory and intervention \nrules, and they even go so far as to contend that those \nrules \u201cpreclude appellate review.\u201d  Fasken Br. 41, 38-\n39; Texas Br. 12-13, 18-19.  Not so, at all.   \nFirst, and to be crystal clear: the straightforward \napplication of the NRC\u2019s adjudicatory hearing rules \nand the Hobbs Act does not somehow \u201cclose the court-\nhouse door\u201d to anyone.  The Hobbs Act indisputably al-\nlows judicial review, for \u201cparties aggrieved.\u201d  Texas \ncould have attempted to become a \u201cparty,\u201d as the reg-\nulations expressly provide, and as many other states \nhave routinely done in the past. See 10 C.F.R. 2.309(h); \ne.g., N.J. Dep\u2019t of Env\u2019t Prot. v. NRC, 561 F.3d 132, 135 \n(3d Cir. 2009) (New Jersey).  But Texas chose not to.  \nFasken did try to become a party for other, separate, \nclaims, and actually had its day in court on those as-\nsertions, but lost.  Don\u2019t Waste Mich. v. NRC, No. 21-\n1048, 2023 WL 395030, at *3 (D.C. Cir. Jan. 25, 2023). \nSecond, respondents never challenged the legality \nof the NRC intervention regulations below.  They \n\n6 \ncertainly could have attempted to do so\u2014such chal-\nlenges have been made in the past.  E.g., Blue Ridge \nEnv\u2019t Def. League v. NRC, 716 F.3d 183, 196 (D.C. Cir. \n2013).  But the validity of those regulations is not pre-\nsented in this case.  This Court should not cast aside \nthe Hobbs Act merely because respondents, now, com-\nplain that complying with the NRC\u2019s hearing regula-\ntions would have been too onerous or \u201cfutile\u201d had they \ntried to invoke them.  Texas Br. 20.  E.g., F. Hoffman-\nLa Roche Ltd. v. Empagran S.A., 542 U.S. 155, 175 \n(2004) (\u201cThe Court of Appeals, however, did not ad-\ndress this argument * * *, and, for that reason, neither \nshall we.\u201d).3\nFinally with respect to the Hobbs Act, Fasken ar-\ngues that, because it \u201crequested a hearing\u201d with re-\nspect to certain of its claims, it is a \u201cparty aggrieved\u201d \nfor all purposes under the Hobbs Act, including for its \nFifth Circuit petition.  Fasken Br. 37, 42.  That is not \ncorrect.  In the NRC adjudicatory proceedings, Fasken \nattempted to assert a contention regarding treatment \nof emergency response costs in the NEPA documenta-\ntion, and to reopen the evidentiary record based upon \nalleged NEPA deficiencies regarding transportation \nroutes.  The NRC denied party status, Fasken \n3 This case does not involve anything like the circum-\nstances in PDR Network, LLC v. Carlton & Harris Chiropractic, \nInc., 588 U.S. 1 (2019), the concurring opinion to which Fasken \n(but not Texas) invokes many times.  Fasken Br. 38, 42, 44.  \nThere, the question was whether a defendant in an enforcement \naction was somehow precluded from arguing that the agency\u2019s in-\nterpretation was wrong, because of the potential existence of prior \nHobbs Act review.  PDR Network, 588 U.S. at 27 (Kavanaugh, J., \nconcurring in the judgment).  PDR Network was all about \u201cen-\nforcement actions,\u201d and had nothing to do with the \u201cparty ag-\ngrieved\u201d requirement of the Hobbs Act. \n\n7 \nappealed to the D.C. Circuit, and the D.C. Circuit af-\nfirmed.  Don\u2019t Waste Mich., 2023 WL 395030, at *3.  \nFasken did not seek review of that D.C. Circuit deci-\nsion by this Court.   \nYet Fasken now argues that its prior lack of suc-\ncess at the NRC opened up a second avenue to proceed \nwith its current claims before the Fifth Circuit as a \n\u201cparty aggrieved\u201d under the Hobbs Act.  Fasken Br. 37.  \nFasken argued the opposite below, contending that its \nclaims at the Fifth Circuit were \u201cdifferent\u201d and not the \nsubject of its attempted intervention at the NRC.4\nPutting \naside \nFasken\u2019s \nflip-flopping, \nhowever, \nFasken\u2019s argument fails because an appeal from a de-\nnial of intervention would allow the putative interve-\nnor to challenge only that denial and to seek reopening \nof the proceeding\u2014it does not provide carte blanche to \nchallenge, for any reason whatsoever, the underlying \nmerits determination of the adjudication, to which the \nintervenor was never a \u201cparty.\u201d  E.g., Alaska v. FERC,\n980 F.2d 761, 763 (D.C. Cir. 1992) (\u201cHaving failed to \nachieve the status of a party to the litigation, the pu-\ntative intervenor could not later seek review of the fi-\nnal judgment on the merits.\u201d); S. C. Loveland Co. v. \nUnited States, 534 F.2d 958, 963-964 (D.C. Cir. 1976) \n(requiring re-opening); Nat\u2019l Parks Conservation Ass\u2019n\nv. FERC, 6 F.4th 1044, 1049 & n.4 (9th Cir. 2021) (ex-\nercising jurisdiction over petition brought by non-\nparty petitioner because petitioner is \u201cconsidered a \nparty for the limited purpose of reviewing the agency\u2019s \nbasis for denying party status\u201d (citation omitted)).  In \nshort, Fasken\u2019s actions at the NRC (which it appealed \n4 21-60743 Fasken C.A. Resp. in Opp. to Mot. to Dismiss \nor Transfer the Pet. for Rev. at 4. \n\n8 \nto the D.C. Circuit) cannot support its petition at the \nFifth Circuit. \nII. The Fifth Circuit\u2019s Exercise of Jurisdiction \nPursuant to Its \u201cUltra Vires\u201d Exception to \nthe Hobbs Act Was Error. \nTo repeat: neither respondent suffered from a \n\u201clack of access to courts,\u201d Texas Br. 17, nor did the \nagency do anything to \u201cshield its order from judicial \nreview.\u201d  Fasken Br. 16.  Texas could have attempted \nto intervene as a party and thereby secure meaningful \njudicial review, but it chose not to.  Fasken did receive \nfull judicial review by the D.C. Circuit of the claims \nthat it attempted to pursue in a proper manner, and it \ncertainly could have done so with the other claims that \nit tried to press at the Fifth Circuit.  There is no reason \nin the world that Texas and Fasken could not have \navailed themselves of the well-known, long-estab-\nlished route to meaningful judicial review provided by \nthe Hobbs Act.  But they didn\u2019t. \nThat fact renders all of the purported \u201cultra vires\u201d \nauthorities upon which respondents now rely (Fasken \nBr. 43-46, Texas Br. 21-23) inapplicable to this case.  \nIndeed, Texas admits as much, characterizing the \ncases it cites as being where \u201c[n]o statute provided a \ncause of action.\u201d  Texas Br. 22.  In those cases, courts \nwere addressing congressional or agency action that \nwas argued to completely preclude any meaningful ju-\ndicial review at all.  E.g., Leedom v. Kyne, 358 U.S. \n184, 188 (1958); see also, e.g., Abbott Lab\u2019ys v. Gard-\nner, 387 U.S. 136, 139 (1967) (decision below held that \n\u201creview of these regulations was unauthorized\u201d); \nDeVillier v. Texas, 601 U.S. 285, 293 (2024) (reversing \nnon-statutory exercise of jurisdiction where the \n\n9 \nplaintiff had an available statutory \u201ccause of action\u201d \nfor compensation that it did not exercise); Knick v. \nTownship of Scott, 588 U.S. 180, 201 (2019) (non-stat-\nutory equitable relief unavailable because of availabil-\nity of an alternative statutory \u201cadequate provision\u201d for \nobtaining relief, i.e., the Tucker Act); Edward Hines \nYellow Pine Trs. v. United States, 263 U.S. 143 (1923) \n(pre-Hobbs Act case against ICC); Skinner & Eddy \nCorp. v. United States, 249 U.S. 557 (1919) (same); \nFed. Express Corp. v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Commerce, 39 F.4th \n756, 763-764 (D.C. Cir. 2022) (applying Kyne et al.\nwhere the parties agreed that \u201cno alternative proce-\ndure for review of FedEx\u2019s claim exists,\u201d per 50 U.S.C. \n4821(a)). \nThat is\u2014emphatically\u2014not this case, as even \nJudge Jones essentially conceded in the opinion sup-\nporting denial of en banc review.  ISP App. 43a n.6 (cit-\ning Bd. of Governors of Fed. Rsrv. Sys. v. MCorp Fin., \nInc., 502 U.S. 32, 43-44 (1991)).  This case, instead, in-\nvolved the Fifth Circuit asserting judge-made author-\nity as an atextual supplement to what Congress care-\nfully prescribed in the Hobbs Act.  No case by this \nCourt, or outside of the Fifth Circuit, supports that.  \nThis Court\u2019s decision in MCorp makes that clear, by \ndeclining to apply Kyne and Abbott Laboratories be-\ncause of an adequate alternative opportunity for judi-\ncial review.  502 U.S. at 43-44.   \nTo make matters worse, the Fifth Circuit\u2019s parallel \nreview scheme for purportedly \u201cultra vires\u201d action is \narbitrary and unworkable.  In this very case, the Fifth \nCircuit deemed some of respondents\u2019 Administrative \nProcedure Act claims to be \u201cultra vires,\u201d but others \nwere not.  ISP App. 20a-21a; ISP Br. 22-23; NRC Br. \n\n10 \n22-23.  One of the most persuasive critiques of the \nFifth Circuit\u2019s \u201cultra vires\u201d doctrine is that any clever \nlitigant can frame almost any argument of agency er-\nror as the agency exceeding its lawful authority\u2014it is, \nas Judge Easterbrook observed for the Seventh Cir-\ncuit, merely a \u201csynonym for \u2018wrong.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Chi., Milwaukee, \nSt. Paul & Pac. R.R., 799 F.2d at 335.

With respect to each and every \none of them, the Fifth Circuit stands alone.   \nAs a threshold matter, the Fifth Circuit should \nnever have entertained the petitions of Texas and \nFasken at all.  Respondents primarily seek to defend \nthe exercise of jurisdiction by reference to the Fifth \nCircuit\u2019s dicta that jurisdiction could be supported un-\nder the Hobbs Act.  Not so, for multiple reasons.  Per-\nhaps most fundamentally, the actual Hobbs Act says \n\u201cparty aggrieved.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 2344.  Not, as respond-\nents would have it, \u201cparticipant\u201d aggrieved.  Texas Br. \n12 (arguing for \u201creading the word \u2018party\u2019 to mean \u2018par-\nticipant\u2019\u200a\u201d); Fasken Br. 38 (arguing that the \u201cstatutory \nrequirement\u201d is \u201cparticipation\u201d).  Even by 1983, appli-\ncation of the statutory \u201cparty aggrieved\u201d requirement \nenjoyed \u201cpresumptive validity conferred by a decade of \nacceptance in this and other circuits,\u201d Simmons v. ICC, \n716 F.2d 40, 43 (D.C. Cir. 1983) (Scalia, J.), and that \nsettled validity had only increased over the ensuing \ntwo-plus decades of uniform applications by the courts \nof appeals.  Until the Fifth Circuit\u2019s contrary, and in-\ncorrect, dicta in this case. \nIn the Hobbs Act, Texas and Fasken had available \nto them a full, fair, and well-established pathway to \nfull judicial review for all of the claims they attempted \nto assert at the Fifth Circuit, but they intentionally es-\nchewed that route, apparently for strategic reasons.  \nThat fact distinguishes these circumstances from \nevery one of the purported \u201cultra vires\u201d authorities \nupon which respondents rely.  That fact also reveals \nthe Fifth Circuit\u2019s exercise of so-called \u201cultra vires\u201d \n\n2 \njurisdiction in this case for what it was: judicial over-\nreach based upon a long-dormant outlier doctrine, \noriginally based upon dubious dicta, arbitrary and un-\nworkable in practice, and persuasively rejected by \nevery other circuit court that has ever looked at it.  The \nFifth Circuit\u2019s exercise of so-called \u201cultra vires\u201d juris-\ndiction should be reversed. \nOn the issue of whether the NRC had authority to \ndo what it did here, respondents\u2019 construction of the \nAtomic Energy Act cannot be reconciled with this \nCourt\u2019s decision in Pacific Gas & Elec. Co. v. State En-\nergy Res. Conservation & Dev. Comm\u2019n, 461 U.S. 190 \n(1983).  Respondents\u2019 arguments also violate multiple \nelemental principles of statutory interpretation, lead \nto obviously incorrect results, and are at odds with \nmultiple well-reasoned authorities outside of the Fifth \nCircuit.  \nRespondents\u2019 invocation of the Nuclear Waste Pol-\nicy Act (\u201cNWPA\u201d) fares no better.  They still have not \nidentified any statutory text to support the Fifth Cir-\ncuit\u2019s holding that the NWPA \u201cdoesn\u2019t permit\u201d the li-\ncensing of temporary possession of spent nuclear fuel \nby a private party at an away-from-reactor site.  ISP \nApp. 30a.  Respondents fundamentally misconstrue \nthe text, structure, and purposes of the NWPA, and, \nagain, fail to justify the departure that they urge from \nwell-reasoned and uniform contrary precedent outside \nof the Fifth Circuit.   \nFor all of these reasons, the judgment of the Fifth \nCircuit should be reversed, and the Fifth Circuit \nshould be directed to dismiss or deny the petitions. \n\n3 \nARGUMENT \nI.\nNeither Texas Nor Fasken Was a \u201cParty Ag-\ngrieved\u201d Under the Hobbs Act \nThe language used by Congress in the Hobbs Act \ncontrols: it says \u201cparty aggrieved.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 2344 (em-\nphasis supplied).  Not \u201cparticipant\u201d aggrieved, contra\nTexas Br. 12, Fasken Br. 38, and not \u201cperson\u201d ag-\ngrieved, as in the Administrative Procedure Act \npassed just four years prior.  5 U.S.C. 702.  Congress\u2019s \n\u201capparently intentional\u201d reference to a \u201cparty\u201d in the \nHobbs Act must be given meaning, as then-Judge \nScalia noted decades ago, and effectively means what \n\u201cparty\u201d means in \u201cappeals from district court deci-\nsions.\u201d  See Simmons v. ICC, 716 F.2d 40, 43 (D.C. Cir. \n1983); see also In re Chi., Milwaukee, St. Paul & Pac. \nR.R., 799 F.2d 317, 335 (7th Cir. 1986) (Easterbrook, \nJ.).  Respondents\u2019 contrary view lacks textual or prec-\nedential support.  See Texas Br. 10; Fasken Br. 40-41.   \nWithout exception and for decades now, case after \ncase has held that, when Congress vested courts of ap-\npeals with jurisdiction to entertain challenges to cer-\ntain agency actions in the Hobbs Act, challengers who \nfailed to \u201cproperly intervene[\u200a] in the underlying NRC \nproceeding * * * are not \u2018part[ies] aggrieved,\u2019\u201d and \ntherefore may not seek judicial review under the \nHobbs Act.  Ohio Nuclear Free Network v. NRC, 53 \nF.4th 236, 239 (D.C. Cir. 2022); see also Gage v. Atomic \nEnergy Comm\u2019n, 479 F.2d 1214, 1217-1218 (D.C. Cir. \n1973); Packard Elevator v. ICC, 808 F.2d 654, 656 (8th \nCir. 1986); State ex rel. Balderas v. NRC, 59 F.4th \n\n4 \n1112, 1116-1119 (10th Cir. 2023).1  In most of those \ncases, the petitioners argued that they had sufficiently \nparticipated to make them \u201cparties\u201d (by, for example, \nsubmitting letters to NRC staff, Ohio Nuclear Free \nNetwork, 53 F.4th at 239)\u2014just as Texas and Fasken \nargue here.  To no avail.  And those cases were exactly \nright.  Unlike the Fifth Circuit\u2019s dicta in this case, the \nuniform contrary authority correctly applies the clear \nstatutory language of the Hobbs Act.2\nThis consistently applied interpretation is not at \nall undercut by the unremarkable observation that \nwhat is required to become a \u201cparty\u201d can vary depend-\ning on whether the agency proceeding is a rulemaking \nor an adjudication.  Water Transp. Ass\u2019n v. ICC, 819 \nF.2d 1189, 1192 (D.C. Cir. 1987).  That is merely ap-\nplying the words of the statute to the facts of the par-\nticular agency action at issue.  Respondents, on the \nother hand, want to upend settled law with a categor-\nical judge-made rule that ignores factual variations \n1 The single passing reference by this Court to \u201can ag-\ngrieved party\u201d in connection with a discussion of the Administra-\ntive Procedure Act in Darby v. Cisneros, 509 U.S. 137, 146 (1993), \nupon which Texas heavily relies (Texas Br. 10, 18), but which \nFasken does not cite, does not suggest the contrary.  Darby had \nnothing to do with Hobbs Act jurisdiction, but, instead, involved \nwhat the parties to that case agreed to be a \u201cjudicially created \ndoctrine of exhaustion.\u201d  509 U.S. at 138.   \n2 The judicial intervention provision in the Hobbs Act at \n28 U.S.C. 2348 further supports this conclusion, as ISP and the \nNRC explained, ISP Br. 25-26, NRC Br. 19-20, and as the Elev-\nenth Circuit held in Alabama Power Co. v. FCC, 311 F.3d 1357, \n1366 (11th Cir. 2002).  That provision draws a clear distinction \nbetween a \u201cparty\u201d to an agency proceeding (who may intervene in \na court proceeding as of right) and others whose interests are af-\nfected (who may only intervene with leave).  That underscores the \nsignificance of the use of \u201cparty\u201d aggrieved in Section 2344. \n\n5 \nand applies an undefined lowest common denominator \nin all circumstances, Texas Br. 12, Fasken Br. 41, but \nthere is no justification for such a departure.  Indeed, \nTexas imagines hypothetical difficulties and confusion \nif the Hobbs Act \u201cparty aggrieved\u201d requirement was to \nbe applied differently for a rulemaking and an adjudi-\ncation.  Texas Br. 15-16.  The legal principles as de-\nscribed by Texas, however, have in fact been the set-\ntled law in this country for many decades, and nothing \nlike the dire consequences portrayed by Texas have \ncome to pass.   \nWhat respondents (and several of the amici) really \nseem to be complaining about is that they do not like \nthe NRC\u2019s longstanding adjudicatory and intervention \nrules, and they even go so far as to contend that those \nrules \u201cpreclude appellate review.\u201d  Fasken Br. 41, 38-\n39; Texas Br. 12-13, 18-19.  Not so, at all.   \nFirst, and to be crystal clear: the straightforward \napplication of the NRC\u2019s adjudicatory hearing rules \nand the Hobbs Act does not somehow \u201cclose the court-\nhouse door\u201d to anyone.  The Hobbs Act indisputably al-\nlows judicial review, for \u201cparties aggrieved.\u201d  Texas \ncould have attempted to become a \u201cparty,\u201d as the reg-\nulations expressly provide, and as many other states \nhave routinely done in the past. See 10 C.F.R. 2.309(h); \ne.g., N.J. Dep\u2019t of Env\u2019t Prot. v. NRC, 561 F.3d 132, 135 \n(3d Cir. 2009) (New Jersey).  But Texas chose not to.  \nFasken did try to become a party for other, separate, \nclaims, and actually had its day in court on those as-\nsertions, but lost.  Don\u2019t Waste Mich. v. NRC, No. 21-\n1048, 2023 WL 395030, at *3 (D.C. Cir. Jan. 25, 2023). \nSecond, respondents never challenged the legality \nof the NRC intervention regulations below.  They \n\n6 \ncertainly could have attempted to do so\u2014such chal-\nlenges have been made in the past.  E.g., Blue Ridge \nEnv\u2019t Def. League v. NRC, 716 F.3d 183, 196 (D.C. Cir. \n2013).  But the validity of those regulations is not pre-\nsented in this case.  This Court should not cast aside \nthe Hobbs Act merely because respondents, now, com-\nplain that complying with the NRC\u2019s hearing regula-\ntions would have been too onerous or \u201cfutile\u201d had they \ntried to invoke them.  Texas Br. 20.  E.g., F. Hoffman-\nLa Roche Ltd. v. Empagran S.A., 542 U.S. 155, 175 \n(2004) (\u201cThe Court of Appeals, however, did not ad-\ndress this argument * * *, and, for that reason, neither \nshall we.\u201d).3\nFinally with respect to the Hobbs Act, Fasken ar-\ngues that, because it \u201crequested a hearing\u201d with re-\nspect to certain of its claims, it is a \u201cparty aggrieved\u201d \nfor all purposes under the Hobbs Act, including for its \nFifth Circuit petition.  Fasken Br. 37, 42.  That is not \ncorrect.  In the NRC adjudicatory proceedings, Fasken \nattempted to assert a contention regarding treatment \nof emergency response costs in the NEPA documenta-\ntion, and to reopen the evidentiary record based upon \nalleged NEPA deficiencies regarding transportation \nroutes.  The NRC denied party status, Fasken \n3 This case does not involve anything like the circum-\nstances in PDR Network, LLC v. Carlton & Harris Chiropractic, \nInc., 588 U.S. 1 (2019), the concurring opinion to which Fasken \n(but not Texas) invokes many times.  Fasken Br. 38, 42, 44.  \nThere, the question was whether a defendant in an enforcement \naction was somehow precluded from arguing that the agency\u2019s in-\nterpretation was wrong, because of the potential existence of prior \nHobbs Act review.  PDR Network, 588 U.S. at 27 (Kavanaugh, J., \nconcurring in the judgment).  PDR Network was all about \u201cen-\nforcement actions,\u201d and had nothing to do with the \u201cparty ag-\ngrieved\u201d requirement of the Hobbs Act. \n\n7 \nappealed to the D.C. Circuit, and the D.C. Circuit af-\nfirmed.  Don\u2019t Waste Mich., 2023 WL 395030, at *3.  \nFasken did not seek review of that D.C. Circuit deci-\nsion by this Court.   \nYet Fasken now argues that its prior lack of suc-\ncess at the NRC opened up a second avenue to proceed \nwith its current claims before the Fifth Circuit as a \n\u201cparty aggrieved\u201d under the Hobbs Act.  Fasken Br. 37.  \nFasken argued the opposite below, contending that its \nclaims at the Fifth Circuit were \u201cdifferent\u201d and not the \nsubject of its attempted intervention at the NRC.4\nPutting \naside \nFasken\u2019s \nflip-flopping, \nhowever, \nFasken\u2019s argument fails because an appeal from a de-\nnial of intervention would allow the putative interve-\nnor to challenge only that denial and to seek reopening \nof the proceeding\u2014it does not provide carte blanche to \nchallenge, for any reason whatsoever, the underlying \nmerits determination of the adjudication, to which the \nintervenor was never a \u201cparty.\u201d  E.g., Alaska v. FERC,\n980 F.2d 761, 763 (D.C. Cir. 1992) (\u201cHaving failed to \nachieve the status of a party to the litigation, the pu-\ntative intervenor could not later seek review of the fi-\nnal judgment on the merits.\u201d); S. C. Loveland Co. v. \nUnited States, 534 F.2d 958, 963-964 (D.C. Cir. 1976) \n(requiring re-opening); Nat\u2019l Parks Conservation Ass\u2019n\nv. FERC, 6 F.4th 1044, 1049 & n.4 (9th Cir. 2021) (ex-\nercising jurisdiction over petition brought by non-\nparty petitioner because petitioner is \u201cconsidered a \nparty for the limited purpose of reviewing the agency\u2019s \nbasis for denying party status\u201d (citation omitted)).  In \nshort, Fasken\u2019s actions at the NRC (which it appealed \n4 21-60743 Fasken C.A. Resp. in Opp. to Mot. to Dismiss \nor Transfer the Pet. for Rev. at 4. \n\n8 \nto the D.C. Circuit) cannot support its petition at the \nFifth Circuit. \nII. The Fifth Circuit\u2019s Exercise of Jurisdiction \nPursuant to Its \u201cUltra Vires\u201d Exception to \nthe Hobbs Act Was Error. \nTo repeat: neither respondent suffered from a \n\u201clack of access to courts,\u201d Texas Br. 17, nor did the \nagency do anything to \u201cshield its order from judicial \nreview.\u201d  Fasken Br. 16.  Texas could have attempted \nto intervene as a party and thereby secure meaningful \njudicial review, but it chose not to.  Fasken did receive \nfull judicial review by the D.C. Circuit of the claims \nthat it attempted to pursue in a proper manner, and it \ncertainly could have done so with the other claims that \nit tried to press at the Fifth Circuit.  There is no reason \nin the world that Texas and Fasken could not have \navailed themselves of the well-known, long-estab-\nlished route to meaningful judicial review provided by \nthe Hobbs Act.  But they didn\u2019t. \nThat fact renders all of the purported \u201cultra vires\u201d \nauthorities upon which respondents now rely (Fasken \nBr. 43-46, Texas Br. 21-23) inapplicable to this case.  \nIndeed, Texas admits as much, characterizing the \ncases it cites as being where \u201c[n]o statute provided a \ncause of action.\u201d  Texas Br. 22.  In those cases, courts \nwere addressing congressional or agency action that \nwas argued to completely preclude any meaningful ju-\ndicial review at all.  E.g., Leedom v. Kyne, 358 U.S. \n184, 188 (1958); see also, e.g., Abbott Lab\u2019ys v. Gard-\nner, 387 U.S. 136, 139 (1967) (decision below held that \n\u201creview of these regulations was unauthorized\u201d); \nDeVillier v. Texas, 601 U.S. 285, 293 (2024) (reversing \nnon-statutory exercise of jurisdiction where the \n\n9 \nplaintiff had an available statutory \u201ccause of action\u201d \nfor compensation that it did not exercise); Knick v. \nTownship of Scott, 588 U.S. 180, 201 (2019) (non-stat-\nutory equitable relief unavailable because of availabil-\nity of an alternative statutory \u201cadequate provision\u201d for \nobtaining relief, i.e., the Tucker Act); Edward Hines \nYellow Pine Trs. v. United States, 263 U.S. 143 (1923) \n(pre-Hobbs Act case against ICC); Skinner & Eddy \nCorp. v. United States, 249 U.S. 557 (1919) (same); \nFed. Express Corp. v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Commerce, 39 F.4th \n756, 763-764 (D.C. Cir. 2022) (applying Kyne et al.\nwhere the parties agreed that \u201cno alternative proce-\ndure for review of FedEx\u2019s claim exists,\u201d per 50 U.S.C. \n4821(a)). \nThat is\u2014emphatically\u2014not this case, as even \nJudge Jones essentially conceded in the opinion sup-\nporting denial of en banc review.  ISP App. 43a n.6 (cit-\ning Bd. of Governors of Fed. Rsrv. Sys. v. MCorp Fin., \nInc., 502 U.S. 32, 43-44 (1991)).  This case, instead, in-\nvolved the Fifth Circuit asserting judge-made author-\nity as an atextual supplement to what Congress care-\nfully prescribed in the Hobbs Act.  No case by this \nCourt, or outside of the Fifth Circuit, supports that.  \nThis Court\u2019s decision in MCorp makes that clear, by \ndeclining to apply Kyne and Abbott Laboratories be-\ncause of an adequate alternative opportunity for judi-\ncial review.  502 U.S. at 43-44.   \nTo make matters worse, the Fifth Circuit\u2019s parallel \nreview scheme for purportedly \u201cultra vires\u201d action is \narbitrary and unworkable.  In this very case, the Fifth \nCircuit deemed some of respondents\u2019 Administrative \nProcedure Act claims to be \u201cultra vires,\u201d but others \nwere not.  ISP App. 20a-21a; ISP Br. 22-23; NRC Br. \n\n10 \n22-23.  One of the most persuasive critiques of the \nFifth Circuit\u2019s \u201cultra vires\u201d doctrine is that any clever \nlitigant can frame almost any argument of agency er-\nror as the agency exceeding its lawful authority\u2014it is, \nas Judge Easterbrook observed for the Seventh Cir-\ncuit, merely a \u201csynonym for \u2018wrong.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Chi., Milwaukee, \nSt. Paul & Pac. R.R., 799 F.2d at 335.  Respondents \nhave no substantive response, but instead just com-\nplain that such a critique is \u201chyperbole.\u201d  Fasken Br. \n47; Texas Br. 23.  It\u2019s not\u2014it is spot on. \nFinally with regard to the Fifth Circuit\u2019s ultra \nvires doctrine, respondents give short shrift to the du-\nbious origins of that doctrine even in the Fifth Circuit \nitself, as well as to the compelling weight of uniform \ncontrary authority.  See ISP Br. 20-22; NRC Br. 23-25. \nThose factors and authorities further confirm that the \nFifth Circuit\u2019s stated basis for hearing the petitions of \nTexas and Fasken was error. \nIII. The Atomic Energy Act Authorizes the NRC \nto License the Temporary Storage of Spent \nNuclear Fuel Away from a Reactor Site \nA. The Atomic Energy Act\u2019s provisions re-\ngarding the constituent radioactive ele-\nments of spent nuclear fuel authorize the \nNRC to regulate spent nuclear fuel. \nIn its decision, the Fifth Circuit accepted the oft-\nrecited (and accurate) proposition that \u201c[s]pecial nu-\nclear material, source material, and byproduct mate-\nrial are constituent materials of spent nuclear fuel,\u201d \nand then proceeded to base its statutory analysis upon \nAEA provisions addressing those constituent materi-\nals.  ISP App. 22a (citing Bullcreek v. NRC, 359 F.3d \n536, 538 (D.C. Cir. 2004)).  Respondents, however, \n\n11 \nhave decided to take a different tack: their AEA argu-\nments now are largely based on the fact that the term \n\u201cspent nuclear fuel\u201d was not separately defined in the \noriginal AEA, but was instead added in 1988 as part of \nan unrelated overhaul of the Price Anderson Act.  \nFasken Br. 24 (\u201cIndeed, Congress did not amend the \nAEA to add \u2018spent nuclear fuel\u2019 as a defined term until \n1988.\u201d (citing Price Anderson Amendments Act \u00a7 4(b), \n102 Stat. 1069)); Texas Br. 25-26.5\nRespondents\u2019 arguments run headlong into Pac. \nGas & Elec. Co. v. State Energy Res. Conservation & \nDev. Comm\u2019n, 461 U.S. 190 (1983).  That case was all \nabout \u201cspent fuel,\u201d id. at 194, and, more particularly, \nthe metes and bounds of how much Congress had oc-\ncupied the field regarding the storage of spent fuel in \nthe AEA, for preemption purposes.  The Court based \nits decision on its analysis of the then-current version \nof the AEA, including the provisions regarding the con-\nstituent elements of spent fuel.  Id. at 207.  The Court \nalso highlighted that \u201cthe NRC has promulgated de-\ntailed regulations governing storage and disposal \naway from the reactor.\u201d  Pac. Gas, 461 U.S. at 217 \n5 Fasken makes much of the fact that a subsequent regu-\nlatory definition of \u201cspent nuclear fuel\u201d includes \u201cother radioac-\ntive materials associated with fuel assemblies.\u201d Fasken Br. 26-27 \n(emphasis omitted) (citing Final Rule, Licensing Requirements \nfor the Storage of Spent Fuel in an Independent Fuel Spent Stor-\nage Installation, 45 Fed. Reg. 74,693, 74,700-01 (Nov. 12, 1980); \n10 C.F.R. 72.3).  That reference merely recognizes the existence \nof control rod elements and the like\u2014the packaging that holds a \nnuclear fuel assembly together\u2014which become irradiated with \nuse.  See, e.g., 10 C.F.R. 961.11, Appendix E, Section B.2.  More-\nover, materials \u201cmade radioactive by exposure to the radiation in-\ncident to the process of producing or utilizing special nuclear ma-\nterial\u201d are, in fact, \u201cbyproduct material.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 2014(e)(1). \n\n12 \n(citing 10 C.F.R. Part 72).  The addition of a separate \ndefinition of \u201cspent nuclear fuel,\u201d on which respond-\nents now place such heavy reliance, had not yet oc-\ncurred\u2014that was still some five years into the future.  \nAnd the recently enacted Nuclear Waste Policy Act did \nnot affect the preemption analysis.  Pac. Gas, 461 U.S. \nat 219.   \nWhile the Court ultimately held that the chal-\nlenged state statute addressed economic matters re-\nserved to the states and was therefore not preempted, \nthe Court\u2019s reasoning offered definitive guidance on \nthe scope of the AEA.  The Court made clear that Con-\ngress had \u201coccupied the entire field of nuclear safety \nconcerns,\u201d and the NRC, given the already-existing \nstatutory and regulatory landscape under the AEA, \nhad exercised its authority \u201cto authorize the storage of \nspent fuel.\u201d  461 U.S. at 212, 218.  Indeed, a key prem-\nise of the Court\u2019s holding was that although the federal \ngovernment was responsible to develop and license \ntechnology for \u201cnuclear waste disposal,\u201d the state stat-\nute had not attempted \u201cto enter this field  * * *  occu-\npied by the federal government.\u201d  Id. at 219.  The main \narguments propounded by respondents regarding the \nAEA in this case, therefore, cannot be reconciled with \nthis Court\u2019s decision in Pacific Gas.6\n6 Texas posits an analogy about erroneously concluding \nthat the Federal Aviation Administration can regulate water, be-\ncause it can regulate hydrogen-fueled planes with oxygen equip-\nment.  Texas Br. 38.  That misses the mark.  The more apt anal-\nogy would be one section of a statute criminalizing the possession \nof heroin, and another the possession of cocaine.  No one could \nseriously argue that merely mixing the two drugs together takes \none completely outside of the law.  Yet, that is the essential posi-\ntion of respondents here. \n\n13 \nB. Respondents are unable to proffer any \nplausible interpretation of statutory text \nto support what they say the law is. \nRespondents\u2019 definitional arguments reveal an-\nother fundamental flaw in their efforts to defend the \nresult of the Fifth Circuit: there is no sensible inter-\npretation of the statutes that leads to what respond-\nents contend the law to be.  Texas asserts that the \nNRC \u201ccannot license possession of spent nuclear fuel at \nall.\u201d  Texas Br. 40.  Similarly, Fasken asserts that \u201c[n]o \nAEA provision grants NRC express authority to issue \na license for storing spent fuel.\u201d  Fasken Br. 24.  But, \nat the same time, Texas admits that \u201cno one disputes \nthat storage facilities onsite are permissible; they \nmust be.\u201d  Texas Br. 36.  Well, what statutory provi-\nsion provides that \u201cpermission\u201d?  Respondents do not \nsay. \nThe necessary flipside of respondents\u2019 arguments \nalso reveals their error.  If, as respondents contend, \nthe provisions of the AEA addressing the constituent \ncomponents do not authorize the NRC to issue a li-\ncense for the possession and storage of \u201cspent nuclear \nfuel,\u201d then the AEA also cannot prohibit the possession \nand storage of \u201cspent nuclear fuel\u201d\u2014you cannot have \none without the other.7  We would be in a state of na-\nture: the unavoidable implication of respondents\u2019 ar-\nguments is that ISP did not even need a license from \nthe NRC, and could have just constructed the facility \non its own.  It is hard to imagine a scenario more inim-\nical to what Congress expressly identified as the core \n7 The prohibitions upon possession without a license are \nat 42 U.S.C. 2077(a) (special nuclear material), 2092 (source ma-\nterial) and 2111(a) (byproduct material). \n\n14 \npurposes of the AEA.  E.g., 42 U.S.C. 2011(a), (b); \n2012(a); 2013(d).  The statute should be interpreted in \na manner that harmonizes those provisions, not cre-\nates such elemental conflicts.  E.g., Antonin Scalia & \nBryan A. Garner, Reading Law: The Interpretation of \nLegal Texts (\u201cReading Law\u201d) 181-182 (2012). \nC. Respondents\u2019 ejusdem generis-type inter-\npretations of the AEA are erroneous. \nNeither respondent tries to defend the Fifth Cir-\ncuit\u2019s interpretive analysis of the AEA.  The court be-\nlow held that the only permissible licenses with re-\nspect to special nuclear and source material were for \n\u201ccertain types of research and development,\u201d ISP App. \n22a, based upon 42 U.S.C. 2073(a)(1) and (2) and \n2093(a)(1) and (2).  The Fifth Circuit inexplicably \nfailed to account for subsection (a)(3) of both statutory \nsections, and failed to give any meaning to subsection \n(a)(4).  And with regard to byproduct material, the \nFifth Circuit misconstrued an inapplicable provision \n(42 U.S.C. 2111(b)) based upon internet-derived con-\nclusions involving not byproduct, but special nuclear, \nmaterial.  ISP App. 23a; see ISP Br. 37. \nRespondents, however, do try to construct post-hoc\nejusdem generis-type defenses of the Fifth Circuit\u2019s re-\nsult, at least with respect to special nuclear and source \nmaterial. Fasken Br. 29-31; Texas Br. 26-28, 40-43.  \nThose efforts fail.   \nFirst, respondents cannot identify a supportable \n\u201ccommon attribute\u201d that fits their needs.  That, alone, \nprecludes the ejusdem generis-type arguments of re-\nspondents.  E.g., Ali v. Fed. Bureau of Prisons, 552 U.S. \n214, 225 (2008); Reading Law 209 (\u201c\u2018the enumeration \nof the specific items is so heterogeneous as to disclose \n\n15 \nno common genus.\u2019 With this type of wording, the \ncanon does not apply.\u201d (quoting Lord Macmillan, Law \nand Other Things 166 (1938)).  The specifically enu-\nmerated potential uses here include research and de-\nvelopment related to atomic energy ((2073(a)(1), \n2093(a)(1)), research or development related to medi-\ncal therapy or medical therapy itself ((2073(a)(2), \n2093(a)(2)), and for \u201cuse in a license\u201d for certain isotope \nproduction facilities, and in nuclear power plants.  42 \nU.S.C. 2073(a)(3), 2093(a)(3).  Respondents have come \nup with an argued common attribute of \u201cproductive \nuse,\u201d which they say excludes temporary storage of the \nmaterials, even at reactor sites.  Fasken Br. 30; Texas \nBr. 28.  That, however, is a made-up restriction with-\nout any textual, historical, or other support, and is fur-\nther belied by the admission that \u201csome form of tem-\nporary, onsite storage of spent nuclear fuel inheres in \nthe use of nuclear fuel.\u201d  Texas Br. 36.  If there is any \n\u201ccommon attribute\u201d here (and ISP does not agree that \nthere is), the fact that the enumerated items include \nnuclear power plants would mean that regulation of \nradioactive materials that \u201cinhere\u201d to operation of \nsuch plants would fit comfortably within any reasona-\nble postulated commonality. \nSecond, whether or not one labels Sections \n2073(a)(4) and 2093(a)(4) as \u201ccatch-all\u201d provisions, \nthose terms indisputably have to be given some mean-\ning.  Bilski v. Kappos, 561 U.S. 596, 607-608 (2010); \nBabbitt v. Sweet Home Chapter of Communities for a \nGreat Or., 515 U.S. 687, 702 (1995).  Respondents\u2019 con-\nstructs fail to do so, and the better interpretation is to \nconclude that the provisions encompass the licensing \nof temporary storage of spent nuclear fuel at away-\nfrom-reactors sites.   \n\n16 \nIt is also important to give meaning to what Con-\ngress actually said about the duties of the NRC, which \nis that it was required to \u201cestablish by rule, regulation, \nor order, such standards and instructions to govern the \npossession and use of special nuclear material, source \nmaterial, and byproduct material, as the Commission \nmay deem necessary or desirable to promote the com-\nmon defense and security or to protect health or to \nminimize danger to life or property,\u201d 42 U.S.C. \n2201(b), consistent with the \u201cdevelopment, use, and \ncontrol of atomic energy,\u201d 42 U.S.C. 2011(a),8 and \nwithout any locational limitation.  The restrictive con-\ntentions of respondents are irreconcilable with Con-\ngress\u2019s clear commands. \nIn short, respondents cannot defend the Fifth Cir-\ncuit\u2019s construction of the AEA, nor reconcile their ar-\nguments with Pacific Gas, 461 U.S. at 217, nor defend \nthe Fifth Circuit\u2019s departure from Bullcreek, 359 F.3d \nat 541, and Skull Valley Band of Goshute Indians v. \nNielson, 376 F.3d 1223, 1232 (10th Cir. 2004).  See \nalso, Beyond Nuclear, Inc. v. NRC, 113 F.4th 956, 964 \n(D.C. Cir. 2024).  Which is perhaps why they have, \nnow, pivoted to relying primarily upon the NWPA for \ntheir merits-based arguments. \n8 These provisions are not, as Texas claims, mere empty \n\u201cpolicy statements\u201d that can be ignored for these purposes. Texas \nBr. 37-38, 41 (citing Sturgeon v. Frost, 587 U.S. 28 (2019)).  Ra-\nther, they are commands and delegations that do not conflict or \noverride any operative language from the statute and quite inten-\ntionally leave the agency with flexibility to regulate.  This Court \nhas recognized that such provisions should be applied as written.  \nLoper Bright Enters. v. Raimondo, 603 U.S. 369, 395 & n.6 (2024).   \n\n17 \nIV. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act Does Not For-\nbid the NRC from Licensing Private Parties\u2019 \nTemporary Storage of Spent Nuclear Fuel \nAway from a Reactor Site. \nRespondents \nfundamentally \nmisconstrue \nthe \nNWPA.  They erroneously contend that it is the \nNWPA, rather than the AEA, that must provide the \n\u201cstatutory authority to license ISP\u2019s private, offsite \nstorage.\u201d  Fasken Br. 17; Texas Br. 29-31.  That is just \nnot so.  E.g., Balderas, 59 F.4th at 1115, 1121 (NWPA \n\u201cgoverns the establishment of a federal repository for \npermanent storage [i.e., disposal], not temporary stor-\nage by private parties.\u201d).  It is true enough that peti-\ntioners \u201cdo not contend the NWPA authorizes ISP\u2019s li-\ncense\u201d (Fasken Br. 20), but that is because no one ever \nthought that the NWPA was enacted to do so.  And it \nwasn\u2019t, as confirmed by the text, structure, and legis-\nlative history of that law. \nRegarding the text: the Fifth Circuit held that the \nNWPA \u201cdoesn\u2019t permit\u201d the ISP license, ISP App. 30a, \nbut cited no statutory provision that says that.  Nor do \nrespondents.  There is none.  Fasken contends that 42 \nU.S.C. 10155(h) \u201cspecifically forbids\u201d private offsite \nstorage facilities (Fasken Br. 19), but that provision \ndoes not \u201cforbid\u201d anything at all.9  Rather, the provi-\nsion says \u201cnothing in this chapter\u201d\u2014meaning the \nNWPA\u2014\u201cshall be construed to * * * authorize\u201d private \n9 42 U.S.C. 10155(h): \u201cApplication * * * Notwithstanding \nany other provision of law, nothing in this chapter shall be con-\nstrued to encourage, authorize, or require the private or Federal \nuse, purchase, lease or other acquisition of any storage facility \nlocated away from the site of any civilian power nuclear reactor \nand not owned by the Federal Government on January 7, 1983.\u201d \n\n18 \nstorage facilities.  See Bullcreek, 359 F.3d at 542.  In \nother words, the provision limits the scope of the \nNWPA.  But the NWPA is not, and never has been, the \nsource of the NRC\u2019s licensing authority at issue here.  \nRespondents\u2019 position cannot be squared with the stat-\nute\u2019s words\u2014it would make no sense for Congress to \nsay that the law did nothing to \u201cencourage\u201d or \u201cre-\nquire\u201d an activity if (as respondents argue) that activ-\nity was already altogether banned.  Respondents can \npoint to no statutory text whatsoever to support their \nmain substantive position. \nRegarding the structure: The overall purpose of the \nNWPA was to establish the federal government\u2019s re-\nsponsibilities for the permanent disposal of spent nu-\nclear fuel.  Subpart A set forth a plan for a permanent \nrepository.  42 U.S.C. 10131-10145.  Subpart B deals \nwith an interim storage program by the federal govern-\nment, pending permanent disposal.  42 U.S.C. 10151-\n10157.  That was a limited program, designed to help \nutilities manage spent nuclear fuel while waiting for a \npermanent disposal site, and\u2014significantly\u2014it ex-\npired by its terms in 1990.  42 U.S.C. 10156(a)(1).  That \nis, there were a number of conditions and processes as-\nsociated with the program, including a requirement \nthat any utility desiring to participate execute a con-\ntract with the federal government \u201cno later than Jan-\nuary 1, 1990.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 10156(a)(1).   \nRespondents chiefly rely upon provisions within \nthat Subpart B.  Texas Br. 29-31; Fasken Br. 18 (citing \n42 U.S.C. 10152, 10153, 10154).  Importantly, how-\never, all of those provisions concerned the limited fed-\neral interim storage program in Subpart B, and there-\nfore can be properly understood only as \u201cpreconditions \n\n19 \non private generators for obtaining federal interim \nstorage.\u201d  Bullcreek, 359 F.3d at 542.  It is plainly \nwrong for respondents to argue that those now-expired\nportions of Subpart B are, instead, the only potential \nsource of the NRC\u2019s current authority to license a pri-\nvate party\u2019s possession of spent nuclear fuel at all, an-\nywhere.  E.g., Idaho v. DOE, 945 F.2d 295, 299 (9th \nCir. 1991) (\u201cThe Act\u2019s restrictive language [in Subpart \nB] limits the requirements to the specific set of reme-\ndial storage agreements authorized by the Act itself.\u201d). \nRegarding the legislative history:  First, and im-\nportantly, the legislative history conclusively confirms \nthat Congress was fully aware that the AEA had been \ninterpreted and applied by the NRC to authorize off-\nsite storage of spent nuclear fuel by private parties.  \nE.g., S. Rep. No. 97-282, at 44 (1981); see Bullcreek, \n359 F.3d at 542; In the Matter of Private Fuel Storage, \nCLI-02-29, 56 N.R.C. 390, 400 (Dec. 18, 2002) (\u201cMem-\nbers of Congress clearly were well aware that \u2018other \nprovisions of law\u2019 authorized private [away-from-reac-\ntor] storage facilities, as the existence, and fate, of \nsuch facilities was discussed in congressional commit-\ntee debates.\u201d), & n.35, n.44, n.45 (citations omitted).10\nCongress, of course, is presumed to know the state of \nthe law when it enacts legislation, e.g., Edelman v. \nLynchburg Coll., 535 U.S. 106, 117-118 (2002), and \nhere that knowledge is unquestionable.  Respondents\u2019 \ncontention that the meaning of the AEA should be in-\nformed by the subsequent NWPA (Texas Br. 28) is fair \n10 In the Matter of Private Fuel Storage, 56 N.R.C. at 399-\n410, cites and summarizes the voluminous relevant legislative \nhistory in a far more comprehensive manner than space will allow \nfor here. \n\n20 \nenough as a general proposition, but that proposition \ncuts squarely against respondents in this case.   \nSecond, with regard to the federal interim storage \nprogram invoked by respondents, the legislative his-\ntory reveals efforts to balance competing concerns \nabout the nature and scope of such a program. See \nS. Rep. No. 97-282 (1981); H.R. Rep. No. 97-491, pt. 1 \n(1982); 128 Cong. Rec. 28,032 (1982).  Sec-\ntion 10155(h), on which respondents heavily rely, went \nthrough drafts and debates which confirm that its ul-\ntimate role was to ensure that DOE would not take \nover private facilities to fulfill its NWPA responsibili-\nties, and that also make clear that utilities would not \nhave to exhaust potential off-site storage options to \ngain access to the federal interim storage program at \nSubpart B (which had been a requirement in some \nearly drafts).11  See Bullcreek, 359 F.3d at 543.

Texas Br. 28, 43; Fasken Br. 21-23.  \nRespondents have not come close to clearing that high \nhurdle in this case.  E.g., Morton v. Mancari, 417 U.S. \n535, 549 (1974).  The preexisting NRC authority under \nthe AEA to license private parties to store spent nu-\nclear fuel away from existing reactor sites was not \nmerely \u201cimplied,\u201d as Fasken argues.  Fasken Br. 22 \n(citing United States v. Fausto, 484 U.S. 439, 453 \n(1988)).  Rather, that AEA authority was demonstra-\nbly and indisputably known to Congress when it \npassed the NWPA, and formally enshrined in the Code \nof Federal Regulations after extensive notice-and com-\nment processes (which Texas contends \u201cprompted \nalarm,\u201d Texas Br. 3).  See Bullcreek, 359 F.3d at 542-\n543.  And, as explained above, there is no conflict \nwhatsoever, much less any \u201cirreconcilable conflict\u201d \n(Fasken Br. 22 (citation omitted)) between the AEA \nand NWPA with regard to the NRC\u2019s authority to li-\ncense private parties to temporarily possess spent nu-\nclear fuel.  Respondents\u2019 case for repeal by implication \nfalls woefully short. \nFinally, both respondents invoke West Virginia v. \nEPA, 597 U.S. 697 (2022).  Fasken Br. 32-33; Texas Br. \n31, 35.

          "task_beliefs": "My understanding of the case has now evolved from a one-sided model based on the petitioner's arguments to a balanced, dialectical view incorporating the respondent's (Texas's) direct counter-arguments. The void in my knowledge has been filled.\n\n1.  **Procedural Question (Hobbs Act):** My prior belief was that the petitioner's argument was a straightforward textualist claim that Texas was not a \"party aggrieved.\" I now have Texas's three-pronged rebuttal:\n    *   **Factual Rebuttal:** Texas asserts it *was* a participant in the agency proceedings and therefore qualifies as a \"party aggrieved\" under the statute's plain meaning. This directly contradicts the petitioner's core factual premise.\n    *   **Jurisdictional Rebuttal (Separation of Powers):** Texas argues that the NRC, as an executive agency, cannot use its own procedural rules to limit the jurisdictional grant given to federal courts by Congress in the Hobbs Act. This reframes the issue from a simple definition of \"party\" to a constitutional question about agency power. They cite cases like *Kucana v. Holder*, suggesting a strong presumption that Congress, not the agency, controls the courthouse doors.\n    *   **Defense of *Ultra Vires* Review:** Texas defends the Fifth Circuit's alternative holding, framing *ultra vires* review not as a \"judge-made exception\" but as a fundamental, long-standing power of the judiciary to rein in agencies that act beyond their statutory authority, citing foundational cases like *Leedom v. Kyne*.\n\n2.  **Substantive Question (NRC Authority):** My previous understanding was based on the petitioner's claim that the Atomic Energy Act (AEA) provides broad authority which the Nuclear Waste Policy Act (NWPA) did not repeal. Texas attacks this framework from multiple angles:\n    *   **AEA as a Limited Grant:** Texas argues the AEA does *not* grant the kind of sweeping authority the NRC claims. Their argument, visible in the brief's structure, will be a close textual reading of specific licensing provisions (e.g., 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2073, 2093, 2111) to demonstrate that they do not authorize massive, private, away-from-reactor storage.\n    *   **NWPA as a Preclusive Scheme:** In direct opposition to the petitioner's \"no implied repeal\" argument, Texas contends the NWPA creates a comprehensive and exclusive statutory scheme for nuclear waste. By designating Yucca Mountain as the single solution and creating a detailed process, Congress occupied the field. The NRC's licensing of a private facility is thus an unlawful attempt to circumvent this specific congressional command.\n    *   **Introduction of the Major Questions Doctrine:** This is the most significant new element. Texas explicitly invokes the Major Questions Doctrine, citing recent landmark cases like *West Virginia v. EPA* and *Biden v. Nebraska*. They argue that creating a de facto national system of private nuclear waste storage is a decision of \"vast economic and political significance\" that requires a clear, explicit authorization from Congress, which they claim is absent from both the AEA and NWPA. This elevates the argument from a technical statutory dispute to a major separation-of-powers question.\n\n3.  **Current State of Uncertainty:** My model of the core legal conflict is now robust and symmetrical. The primary uncertainty is no longer *what* the arguments are, but *which set of arguments* is likely to be more persuasive to the current Supreme Court. The introduction of the Major Questions Doctrine is a powerful signal, as the Court has been highly receptive to this line of reasoning recently. My next step will be to see how the petitioners respond to this doctrinal turn in their reply brief and how amicus briefs align with these competing frameworks.",
          "design_beliefs": "My methodology continues to be validated and refined, moving from simple document analysis to a more strategic modeling of the adversarial process.\n\n1.  **Validated Heuristic: Primacy of the Petitioner's Brief.** This remains the essential first step for establishing the case's foundation.\n2.  **Refined Heuristic: Source Generalization.** Confirmed that the petitioner's role, not their identity (public/private), makes their brief the foundational document.\n3.  **Established Heuristic: Efficient Information Extraction.** The utility of scanning the Table of Contents, Summary of Argument, and Table of Authorities is re-confirmed. The respondent's brief reinforces this, showing how quickly the entire counter-narrative can be mapped.\n4.  **Strongly Validated Heuristic: Sequential Document Analysis.** The latest observation provides powerful confirmation for this principle. My process of modeling the petitioner's brief first, then the respondent's brief, has successfully built a complete, two-sided model of the legal dispute. This A-then-B approach is maximally efficient for understanding the core points of contention.\n5.  **Validated Meta-Heuristic: The Value of Strategic Pauses.** The previous \"THINK\" step allowed me to identify the exact information I needed (the respondent's brief), leading to this highly effective and targeted search action. This confirms the value of the \"plan-act-reflect\" cycle.\n6.  **New Refinement for Information Extraction: The \"Tell-Tale\" Precedent.** The respondent's Table of Authorities immediately flagged the strategic direction of their argument. Seeing *West Virginia v. EPA*, *Biden v. Nebraska*, and *FDA v. Brown & Williamson* was a clear signal of a Major Questions Doctrine argument. My heuristic is now refined: **Scan the Table of Authorities not just for statutes, but for key precedents that act as signposts for overarching doctrinal arguments.**\n7.  **New Heuristic: Identifying the \"Doctrinal Turn.\"** This observation reveals a common and critical litigation strategy. The petitioner framed the case as a standard statutory interpretation dispute. The respondent accepted that frame but also introduced a powerful, cross-cutting doctrinal argument (the Major Questions Doctrine) to reframe the entire case. A new key step in my analysis is to explicitly identify if and how the respondent's brief attempts this \"doctrinal turn,\" as it often becomes the central battleground of the case. My strategy is now not just to compare arguments, but to see if one side successfully changes the nature of the game itself."

          "task_beliefs": "My model of the case's legal architecture is now complete, having integrated the petitioner's final arguments from their reply brief. My understanding has progressed from a one-sided view, to a two-sided dialectic, and now to a complete three-part syllogism (argument, counter-argument, and rebuttal).\n\n1.  **Procedural Question (Hobbs Act):** My understanding of this issue is now fully developed.\n    *   **Initial Belief (Petitioner's Brief):** The argument was a simple textual claim: Texas was not a \"party aggrieved\" under the Hobbs Act.\n    *   **Developed Belief (Respondent's Brief):** Texas countered by arguing \"party\" should be read as \"participant,\" and that an agency (NRC) cannot use its rules to limit a court's jurisdiction granted by Congress.\n    *   **Final, Rebuttal-Informed Belief (Reply Brief):** The petitioner (ISP) has forcefully rebutted Texas's claims, solidifying their original position. They argue that \"party aggrieved\" is an intentional choice by Congress, distinct from \"person\" or \"participant,\" citing textualist-friendly opinions from then-Judge Scalia (*Simmons v. ICC*) and Judge Easterbrook. Crucially, they reframe the issue not as the NRC \"closing the courthouse door,\" but as Texas making a strategic choice *not* to use the available, well-established process to become a party, a path other states have successfully taken. This shifts the narrative from an agency overreach story to one of litigant error or choice.\n\n2.  **Procedural Question (*Ultra Vires* Review):** The petitioner's reply brief has provided a powerful counter-argument that may be dispositive.\n    *   **Initial Belief (Petitioner's Brief):** *Ultra vires* review is a disfavored, \"judge-made exception.\"\n    *   **Developed Belief (Respondent's Brief):** Texas framed it as a fundamental judicial power to check agencies acting outside their authority, citing foundational cases like *Leedom v. Kyne*.\n    *   **Final, Rebuttal-Informed Belief (Reply Brief):** The petitioner has introduced a critical limiting principle to the *ultra vires* doctrine: it is only available when *no other path to judicial review exists*. They argue that since Texas and Fasken *could have* used the Hobbs Act pathway (by seeking to become parties), the extraordinary remedy of *ultra vires* review is inapplicable. They distinguish all of Texas's key precedents on this basis and cite *Board of Governors v. MCorp Fin., Inc.* as Supreme Court authority for declining such review when an alternative statutory route is available. This provides the Court with a very strong, precedent-based reason to reverse the Fifth Circuit on procedural grounds alone.\n\n3.  **Substantive Question (NRC Authority & Major Questions Doctrine):** The final battle lines are drawn, and the petitioner's strategy for countering the Major Questions Doctrine (MQD) is now clear.\n    *   **Initial Belief (Petitioner's Brief):** The Atomic Energy Act (AEA) provides broad authority, which the Nuclear Waste Policy Act (NWPA) did not implicitly repeal.\n    *   **Developed Belief (Respondent's Brief):** Texas introduced the MQD as a \"doctrinal turn,\" arguing that creating a private nuclear waste storage system is a decision of \"vast economic and political significance\" requiring explicit congressional authorization, which they claim is absent.\n    *   **Final, Rebuttal-Informed Belief (Reply Brief):** The petitioner's response to the MQD is primarily one of avoidance and minimization, rather than direct confrontation. They make two main points, visible on pages 21-22 of their reply:\n        *   **Inapplicability:** They argue this is not a \"major question\" because the NRC is not asserting a \"newfound power\" (*West Virginia v. EPA*); rather, it has been licensing similar private storage facilities for decades. They frame it as business-as-usual.\n        *   **Authorization by Implication (Alternative):** They argue that even if it *is* a major question, the AEA's broad grant of authority, combined with the NWPA's failure to repeal it, constitutes sufficient authorization. This is a weaker argument under the MQD's \"clear statement\" rule.\n    *   The petitioner's primary strategy appears to be to win decisively on the procedural questions, making the substantive MQD question moot.\n\n4.  **Current State of Uncertainty & Prediction:** My uncertainty has shifted from *what* the arguments are to *which level* the Court will decide the case on. The petitioner has constructed a compelling \"off-ramp\" for the Court to reverse the Fifth Circuit on purely procedural grounds, avoiding the more contentious substantive questions about the MQD. My prediction now leans toward a reversal, with a high likelihood of it being based on the Hobbs Act \"party aggrieved\" requirement and the inapplicability of *ultra vires* review when a statutory path was available but not taken. A decision on the merits is less certain and would depend entirely on the Court's appetite for applying the MQD in this context.",
          "design_beliefs": "My methodology has been validated through the completion of the briefing cycle, and I have developed several new, more nuanced heuristics for legal analysis.\n\n1.  **Validated Heuristic: Primacy of the Petitioner's Brief.** Remains the essential first step.\n2.  **Refined Heuristic: Source Generalization.** Confirmed that the petitioner's role, not identity, makes their brief foundational.\n3.  **Established Heuristic: Efficient Information Extraction.** The utility of scanning the Table of Contents, Summary of Argument, and Table of Authorities is re-confirmed at every stage.\n4.  **Strongly Validated Heuristic: Sequential Document Analysis.** The A -> B -> A' (Petition -> Opposition -> Reply) sequence has been proven to be the canonical and most effective method for building a complete model of the legal arguments presented to the Court.\n5.  **Validated Meta-Heuristic: The Value of Strategic Pauses.** The \"plan-act-reflect\" cycle has consistently guided me to the most valuable next piece of information.\n6.  **Refined Heuristic: The \"Tell-Tale\" Precedent.** The respondent's use of *West Virginia v. EPA* signaled the MQD argument. The petitioner's reply brief's use of *MCorp Fin., Inc.* immediately signaled their counter-strategy to the *ultra vires* claim. This heuristic is now a core part of my analysis at all briefing stages.\n7.  **Refined Heuristic: Identifying the \"Doctrinal Turn\" and its Counter.** I previously noted the respondent's \"doctrinal turn\" with the MQD. This observation reveals the common counter-moves. My heuristic is now: **When a respondent introduces a \"doctrinal turn,\" analyze the petitioner's reply brief for one of three counter-strategies: (a) direct substantive engagement with the new doctrine, (b) an argument that the doctrine is inapplicable to the facts of the case, or (c) a strategic pivot to a different, dispositive issue (e.g., procedure) to create an \"off-ramp\" for the court.** The petitioner here primarily used (b) and (c).\n8.  **New Heuristic: The Function of the Reply Brief.** The reply brief is not merely a point-by-point rebuttal. Its strategic purpose is to reframe the debate and narrow the grounds for decision. My new heuristic is: **Analyze the reply brief to identify how the petitioner (1) attempts to isolate the lower court's opinion (\"the Fifth Circuit stands alone\"), (2) re-centers their core textual or historical arguments, and (3) provides the Court with the narrowest, most precedential, and least controversial path to rule in their favor.** The petitioner's focus on the procedural issues is a classic example of this strategy."
