    "facts_of_the_case": "Julian Vargas, who is blind, encountered inaccessible check-in kiosks at LabCorp facilities. Vargas attempted to use these kiosks but was unable due to their lack of accessibility for visually impaired individuals. As a result, he had to wait for assistance from a staff member, which delayed his check-in and denied him equal access to services such as maintaining his spot in the queue or updating personal information privately. Vargas claimed that this lack of accessibility infringed on his rights under disability laws, leading to the lawsuit. The district court certified two classes: a California class for Unruh Civil Rights Act claims and a nationwide class for claims under the ADA, the Rehabilitation Act, and the Affordable Care Act. LabCorp appealed the class certification, arguing that the plaintiffs lacked standing, but the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed the district court\u2019s decision.",

My goal is to choose actions that maximize information gain about both the specific case (task parameters, \u03b8) and general prediction strategies (design effectiveness, D).\n\n**Current State:**\n- **Task (\u03b8):** I have the basic facts, the legal question, and the lower court's holding. The core issue is whether a class action can be certified if some class members lack Article III standing. My uncertainty is high regarding the specific legal arguments, the precedents each side will rely on, and the potential positions of the justices.\n- **Design (D):** My uncertainty is also high. I don't know the Court's general disposition towards class action standing issues, the key jurisprudential debates at play (e.g., textualism vs. purposivism in interpreting Rule 23), or the voting records of individual justices on similar matters.\n\n**Plan:**\n1.  **Gather Foundational Case Information (\u03b8):** My first priority is to understand the petitioner's core arguments. The best document for this is the Petition for a Writ of Certiorari. This will provide the legal basis for the appeal, cite key precedents, and frame the question for the Court. This directly addresses my uncertainty about \u03b8.\n2.  **Gather Respondent's Counter-Arguments (\u03b8):** Next, I will need to find the Brief in Opposition from the respondent to understand their counter-arguments.\n3.  **Analyze Broader Legal Context (D):** Once I have the specific legal arguments and precedents from the case filings, I can then search `metadocuments` for scholarly analysis of those precedents and the general legal principles involved. This will help me understand the broader legal landscape and how the Court might approach this issue, thus reducing my uncertainty about D.\n4.  **Synthesize and Predict:** After gathering information from both sides and the broader legal context, I will synthesize the information to make a final prediction.\n\n**Next Action:**\nI will start by searching for the Petition for a Writ of Certiorari to understand the petitioner's arguments.

It only outlines a plan to get that information later. The value is in the plan's quality, not in any immediate information gain about the task.\n\nDesign EIG is slightly higher but still low (0.2) because the thought process articulates a sound, generalizable strategy for tackling SCOTUS cases (Petitioner's brief -> Respondent's brief -> Broader context). This formalizes a potential design for prediction, which is a small step in understanding design effectiveness. However, it doesn't test or validate this design, it merely states it.\n\nConsequently, the Joint EIG is low.

Ramirez*), and their framing of the circuit split. This will dramatically reduce my uncertainty about the petitioner's legal strategy, moving my belief from a vague summary to a detailed, evidence-based model of one side of the case. It is the foundational document for building a task-specific understanding.\n\nDesign EIG is high (0.7) because this action directly tests and validates the core heuristic identified in my current design beliefs: 'Prioritize Primary Sources' and 'Begin by analyzing the Petition'. Successfully retrieving and using this document will provide strong positive evidence that this is an effective and repeatable first step in the SCOTUS prediction process, thus refining my general strategy (D) for all future cases. It confirms a foundational component of an efficient information-gathering workflow.\n\nThe joint EIG is therefore very high, as this single action provides a massive leap in understanding for both the specific case and the general prediction methodology.",

On May 25, 2024, Justice Kagan granted \nLabcorp\u2019s application to extend the time to file this \npetition for certiorari until September 13, 2024.  See \nNo. 23A1050.  This Court has jurisdiction under 28 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 1254(1). \nCONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY \nPROVISIONS INVOLVED \nArticle III, \u00a7\u00a7 1-2 of the United States Constitution \nis reproduced at Pet.App.64a.  Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure 23 is reproduced at Pet.App.66a.   \n \n\n \n2 \n \n \nINTRODUCTION \nThis petition involves an acknowledged split, which \nimplicates billions of dollars, and asks a question this \nCourt has previously granted certiorari to answer: \nWhat to do when a putative class contains numerous \nmembers who lack any Article III injury?  This issue \nhas fractured the circuits: Some deny certification on \nArticle III grounds; others do so under Rule 23(b)(3); \nand the rest see no problem at all, willing to certify \nfirst and resolve matters of individual standing later.  \nBut while the circuits disagree about how to answer \nthis question, all agree on its importance\u2014and also \nthat only this Court can ultimately provide an answer.  \nThis petition presents an opportunity to finally do so. \nThis petition arises from a class action filed against \nLabcorp\u2014one of the country\u2019s leading diagnostic labs.  \nIn 2017, Labcorp introduced a new way for patients to \ncheck-in for appointments.  Along with the front desk \nand online, Labcorp added self-service kiosks\u2014which \nare the subject of this case.  While these kiosks are \nindependently accessible to most patients, they are \nnot accessible to the blind without assistance.  To \naddress this, Labcorp improved its front-desk services \nat the same time\u2014incorporating the same \u201cexpress\u201d \ntechnology it uses in its kiosks\u2014to ensure that blind \npatients have a similarly easy check-in option there. \nEven so, in 2020, a group of legally blind plaintiffs \nbrought this suit, alleging (among other things) that \nLabcorp\u2019s kiosks violated the ADA.  They filed in \nCalifornia, and also brought a claim under its \u201cUnruh \nAct.\u201d  Notably, any violation of the ADA is a per se \nviolation of the Unruh Act\u2014which carries a minimum \nof $4,000 in state law statutory damages per violation. \n\n \n3 \n \n \nA key difficulty for plaintiffs\u2019 class action, though, \nis that it is very hard to find blind patients actually \nharmed by the availability of Labcorp\u2019s new kiosks.  \nUndisputed record evidence indicates that many blind \npatients either do not know these kiosks exist or, if \nthey did, have zero interest in using them, preferring \ninstead to use the front-desk option that has served \nthem well for years.  Even one of the named plaintiffs \n(who is also a named plaintiff in a similar suit against \nQuest Diagnostics) said his one experience at Labcorp \nwas \u201crespectful,\u201d \u201chelpful,\u201d and that he was processed \nin \u201c20 minutes or so.\u201d  Nor did plaintiffs identify an \nexample of anyone unable to access Labcorp\u2019s testing \nservices because they could not use one of its kiosks. \nGiven this defect, plaintiffs defined their proposed \nclasses around all blind patients who had been merely \nexposed to these allegedly unlawful kiosks\u2014i.e., blind \npatients who had walked into a PSC with a kiosk, \nregardless of whether they knew about or wanted to \nuse it.  So defined, plaintiffs estimated the classes at \nhundreds-of-thousands of people.  And they pegged \nthe statutory damages at half a billion dollars a year. \nThe district court certified the classes, and the \nNinth Circuit affirmed.  Neither court, however, \ndisputed that each class contained a sizable number \nof members who lacked Article III injuries\u2014which \nmakes good sense, because a person simply proximate \nto an allegedly unlawful kiosk has not suffered any \nconcrete injury.  But applying binding Ninth Circuit \nprecedent, both courts concluded that this simply did \nnot matter for purposes of Article III or Rule 23(b)(3). \n\n \n4 \n \n \nThe Ninth Circuit\u2019s lax approach to certification\u2014\nrejected one way or the other by about half the \ncircuits, and adopted by the rest\u2014is wrong twice over. \nFor one, Rule 23(b)(3) does not permit a putative \nclass saturated with significant numbers of uninjured \nmembers.  That rule authorizes a class only where \ncommon questions of law and fact predominate over \nindividual questions.  But when the class contains \nmembers lacking Article III injuries, it is necessary to \nseparate the harmed from the unharmed.  And those \nindividualized inquiries will inevitably overwhelm \nany common questions\u2014destroying predominance. \nFor another, Article III bars certification where the \nclass includes any members lacking a concrete injury.  \nClasses are simply procedural devices for aggregating \nclaims.  As such, an individual cannot obtain via a \nclass what he cannot obtain on his own; and if a \nperson would be unable to get through the front doors \nof a federal court independently, he cannot be \nsmuggled in through the back via a class.  A federal \ncourt has no power to assess his claim, full stop\u2014even \nif bundled with the claims of those who have standing. \nThese are not academic issues.  With class actions, \ncertification is often the ballgame.  Once a class has \nbeen certified, the typical next step is settlement, not \ntrial.  And that likelihood becomes an inevitability \nwhere the class is large and hazards colossal liability. \nAccordingly, if a plaintiff can inflate the size of a \nclass with uninjured persons, it can drive up potential \nliability, and thus manufacture leverage with which \nto extort a settlement.  The result is that weak claims \nwin, and tens-of-millions of dollars (if not more) are \nextracted from companies who have done nothing \n\n \n5 \n \n \nwrong\u2014but nonetheless cannot tolerate a massive \nlitigation risk.  And even if some of the uninjured \nmembers are filtered out on the back-end, that does \nlittle good.  By that point, the company has already \nbeen forced into a settlement with the remaining class \nmembers, which should never have happened at all.  \nAnd the lawyers will have already secured yet another \nbounty of fees for having found a new saber to rattle. \nWhether federal law tolerates this gambit has \nfractured the circuits.  And those answering yes have \nbecome hotbeds for these sorts of suits\u2014the Ninth \nCircuit (and, in particular, California) chief among \nthem.  It is essential for this Court to resolve this \ndispute and determine which part of the circuit divide \nis correct.  And this petition is an opportunity to do so. \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nA. Labcorp, PSCs, and Kiosks. \nLabcorp is a leading clinical diagnostic laboratory.  \nIt conducts millions of tests every week, roughly 20% \nof which are performed on samples collected from one \nof Labcorp\u2019s 2,000 patient service centers (PSCs). \nThis case concerns the check-in process for patients \nvisiting a Labcorp PSC.  Tens of millions of patients \nvisit PSCs every year.  In 2017, Labcorp offered \npatients an additional way to check in.  Along with \nbeing able to check in either in person at the front \ndesk of a PSC, or ahead of time online, patients would \nalso be able to check in through a new self-service \nkiosk:  A touchscreen iPad (branded a \u201cLabcorp \nExpress\u201d kiosk) that allowed patients to check in on \ntheir own on-site, without having to first go to the \nfront desk.  Kiosks have since been installed in over \n90% of PSCs. \n\n \n6 \n \n \nLabcorp understood that its kiosks would not be \naccessible to everyone.  So at the same time, Labcorp \nimproved its front desk check-in capabilities, ensuring \nthat the same \u201cexpress\u201d technology (and experience) \nwas present at both the desk and kiosk.  See \nCA9.ER.367-68, 376; see also id. at 386-87.1  Every \nPSC thus has at least one employee available who can \ncheck in patients at the front desk using the same \ntechnology employed by the kiosks.  See id. at 369-72. \nB. This Class Action. \n1. In January 2020, Luke Davis and Julian \nVargas\u2014both legally blind\u2014filed this class action \nagainst Labcorp based on their inability to use the \nself-service kiosks.  That September, the American \nCouncil of the Blind (ACB)\u2014a group representing \n20,000 blind and visually impaired persons across the \ncountry\u2014joined the suit with an amended complaint. \nPlaintiffs asserted violations of the Americans with \nDisabilities Act (ADA), the Rehabilitation Act, and the \nPatient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as well as \nCalifornia\u2019s \u201cUnruh Act.\u201d  Notably, violations of the \nADA are \u201cper se violations of the Unruh Civil Rights \nAct.\u201d  Jankey v. Lee, 290 P.3d 187, 190 (Cal. 2012).  \nAnd each Unruh Act violation triggers (at minimum) \n$4,000 in statutory damages\u2014meaning, every time \nsomeone is exposed to an ADA-violation, that is an \nindependent Unruh violation.  Cal. Civ. Code \u00a7 52(a). \nPlaintiffs pressed the same theory for all claims: On \ntheir view, Labcorp has discriminated against them  \nand other similarly situated blind individuals because \n \n1 \u201cCA9.ER\u201d refers to the Excerpts of Record filed with the \ncourt below and available at CA9 Dkt. No. 21. \n\n \n7 \n \n \nit has not made its kiosks independently  accessible to \nthe blind.  As they put it, Labcorp has \u201cdenied\u201d blind \npatients \u201cfull and equal access\u201d to their PSCs, in that \nthe \u201ctouchscreen kiosks for self-service check-in\u201d are \n\u201cinaccessible\u201d to them.  D.Ct.Doc.40 \u00b6\u00b6 4, 21-22; see \nalso Pet.App.13a-16a (describing allegations). \nTo be clear, none of the plaintiffs has alleged that \nLabcorp has denied a single patient testing or \ndiagnostic services on account of a disability.  Nor do \nthey claim that a single patient was unable to access \nthose services.  Rather, plaintiffs\u2019 suit is based \nentirely on the fact that if they choose to check in at a \nPSC, they must use the front desk rather than a kiosk. \nThe experience of named-plaintiff Julian Vargas\u2014\nthe sole representative for the damages subclass\u2014\nhelps paint the picture.  Fresh off deciding to join a \nsimilar class action against Quest Diagnostics (where \nMr. Vargas is also a named plaintiff), he made his first \never visit to a Labcorp PSC to \u201cfamiliarize\u201d himself \nwith the facility.  CA9.ER.1379, 1366.  There, a \nLabcorp attendant at the front desk told Mr. Vargas \nthat the kiosk was not independently accessible for a \nblind person, but \u201cassured\u201d him someone would be \navailable to assist him at the front desk.  Id. at 1367. \nAnd that is exactly what happened.  Days later, Mr. \nVargas made his second (and final) trip to a Labcorp, \nwhere he received front-desk assistance in \u201cthree to \nfive minutes\u201d and was processed within \u201c20 minutes \nor so.\u201d  Id. at 1374-75.  To check in, Mr. Vargas was \nrequired only to give his identification material to the \nemployee; he never needed to disclose any private \ninformation out loud.  Id. at 1372.  And on his telling, \n\n \n8 \n \n \nLabcorp staff was \u201crespectful,\u201d \u201chelpful,\u201d and provided \nhim all \u201cservices\u201d that he requested.  Id. at 1399-1400. \nThis suit was filed two weeks later. \n2. The plaintiffs have proposed two putative \nclasses: A nationwide injunctive class, premised on \ntheir federal claims; and a California damages \nsubclass, premised on their Unruh Act claim.  The \nclass definitions that were ultimately approved by the \ndistrict court\u2014and are at issue here\u2014are as follows: \nThe Nationwide Class: All legally blind \nindividuals who visited a LabCorp patient \nservice center with a LabCorp Express Self-\nService kiosk in the United States during the \napplicable limitations period, and who, due to \ntheir disability, were unable to use the \nLabCorp Express Self-Service kiosk. \nThe California Subclass: All legally blind \nindividuals who visited a LabCorp patient \nservice center with a LabCorp Express Self-\nService kiosk in California during the \napplicable limitations period and who, due to \ntheir disability, were unable to use the \nLabCorp Express Self-Service kiosk. \nPet.App.63a. \nAs the plaintiffs themselves explained, both of these \nclasses are defined to cover any legally blind person \nwho has been \u201cexposed\u201d to an allegedly ADA-violative \nkiosk\u2014regardless of whether the patient knew about \nor wanted to use one.  See 9th.Cir.Doc.32 at 35, 38, 41.  \nClass membership instead turns on \u201c(1) whether a \nLabCorp Express kiosk was in use on site on the date \nof [a patient\u2019s] visit and (2) whether [that patient] is \nlegally blind.\u201d  Id. at 39-40.  Plaintiffs conceded their \n\n \n9 \n \n \nclasses did not \u201cexclude uninjured members,\u201d and that \nthey were defined to reach beyond those who have \nsuffered a concrete \u201cinjury-in-fact\u201d\u2014i.e., broader than \nthose who have tried or wanted to use a kiosk.  Id. at \n60 (arguing any issues about \u201clegal injury and injury-\nin-fact\u201d should be resolved after certification). \nAnd critically, that is not a small portion of either \nclass.  Unrebutted record evidence showed that nearly \none-fourth of all Labcorp PSC visitors prefer to check \nin at the front desk; and another tenth preferred to do \nso online.  CA9.ER.509.  And there is every indication \nthat for blind patients in particular, those figures are \neven higher.  As the American Council of the Blind\u2019s \ncorporate representative noted in her deposition, their \npreferred option was to have \u201ca staff member be \navailable to check in people\u201d at the facility.  See id. at \n406.  Indeed, the ACB surveyed 4,542 members about \nany experience with Labcorp\u2019s kiosks.  Only twelve \nmembers offered any response.  Id. at 398-99, 455. \nThe individual record evidence tells the same story.  \nTake ACB member John Harden.  Mr. Harden is a \nregular patient at Labcorp.  Id. at 410-12.  He stated \nthat he did not even know there was a kiosk available, \nuntil being asked about it in the ACB survey.  Id. at \n452.  Instead, his preferred mode of check-in is the \nfront desk, which he has happily used for years.  Id.; \nid. at 411-12.  In his words: The ADA says a \u201cbusiness \nneeds to make reasonable accommodations for the \ndisabled,\u201d and Labcorp \u201ccertainly\u201d does so. Id. at 413. \n3.  For all of this, plaintiffs seek injunctive relief as \nwell as damages (plus, of course, attorneys\u2019 fees).  As \nto the former, plaintiffs are demanding a nationwide \ninjunction that requires Labcorp to make its kiosks \n\n \n10 \n \n \nindependently accessible to the blind.  Id. at 683.  As \nfor the latter, plaintiffs do \u201cnot seek class recovery for \nactual damages, personal injuries or emotional \ndistress,\u201d D.Ct.Doc.40 \u00b6 36; they seek only statutory \ndamages under the Unruh Act, which is $4,000 for \neach independent ADA violation, see Pet.App.34a. \nAccording to the plaintiffs, their nationwide class is \nas many as 676,566 people per year.  CA9.ER.557.  \nAnd their damages subclass\u2014which, again, is limited \nto the Unruh Act, and thus California\u2014is as many as \n112,140 people per year.  Id.  Given the Unruh Act\u2019s \nstatutory damages, that could amount to nearly half \na billion dollars of liability per year.  Id. at 556-557. \nC. The District Court Certifies the Classes. \n\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

On May 25, 2024, Justice Kagan granted \nLabcorp\u2019s application to extend the time to file this \npetition for certiorari until September 13, 2024.  See \nNo. 23A1050.  This Court has jurisdiction under 28 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 1254(1). \nCONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY \nPROVISIONS INVOLVED \nArticle III, \u00a7\u00a7 1-2 of the United States Constitution \nis reproduced at Pet.App.64a.  Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure 23 is reproduced at Pet.App.66a.   \n \n\n \n2 \n \n \nINTRODUCTION \nThis petition involves an acknowledged split, which \nimplicates billions of dollars, and asks a question this \nCourt has previously granted certiorari to answer: \nWhat to do when a putative class contains numerous \nmembers who lack any Article III injury?  This issue \nhas fractured the circuits: Some deny certification on \nArticle III grounds; others do so under Rule 23(b)(3); \nand the rest see no problem at all, willing to certify \nfirst and resolve matters of individual standing later.  \nBut while the circuits disagree about how to answer \nthis question, all agree on its importance\u2014and also \nthat only this Court can ultimately provide an answer.  \nThis petition presents an opportunity to finally do so. \nThis petition arises from a class action filed against \nLabcorp\u2014one of the country\u2019s leading diagnostic labs.  \nIn 2017, Labcorp introduced a new way for patients to \ncheck-in for appointments.  Along with the front desk \nand online, Labcorp added self-service kiosks\u2014which \nare the subject of this case.  While these kiosks are \nindependently accessible to most patients, they are \nnot accessible to the blind without assistance.  To \naddress this, Labcorp improved its front-desk services \nat the same time\u2014incorporating the same \u201cexpress\u201d \ntechnology it uses in its kiosks\u2014to ensure that blind \npatients have a similarly easy check-in option there. \nEven so, in 2020, a group of legally blind plaintiffs \nbrought this suit, alleging (among other things) that \nLabcorp\u2019s kiosks violated the ADA.  They filed in \nCalifornia, and also brought a claim under its \u201cUnruh \nAct.\u201d  Notably, any violation of the ADA is a per se \nviolation of the Unruh Act\u2014which carries a minimum \nof $4,000 in state law statutory damages per violation. \n\n \n3 \n \n \nA key difficulty for plaintiffs\u2019 class action, though, \nis that it is very hard to find blind patients actually \nharmed by the availability of Labcorp\u2019s new kiosks.  \nUndisputed record evidence indicates that many blind \npatients either do not know these kiosks exist or, if \nthey did, have zero interest in using them, preferring \ninstead to use the front-desk option that has served \nthem well for years.  Even one of the named plaintiffs \n(who is also a named plaintiff in a similar suit against \nQuest Diagnostics) said his one experience at Labcorp \nwas \u201crespectful,\u201d \u201chelpful,\u201d and that he was processed \nin \u201c20 minutes or so.\u201d  Nor did plaintiffs identify an \nexample of anyone unable to access Labcorp\u2019s testing \nservices because they could not use one of its kiosks. \nGiven this defect, plaintiffs defined their proposed \nclasses around all blind patients who had been merely \nexposed to these allegedly unlawful kiosks\u2014i.e., blind \npatients who had walked into a PSC with a kiosk, \nregardless of whether they knew about or wanted to \nuse it.  So defined, plaintiffs estimated the classes at \nhundreds-of-thousands of people.  And they pegged \nthe statutory damages at half a billion dollars a year. \nThe district court certified the classes, and the \nNinth Circuit affirmed.  Neither court, however, \ndisputed that each class contained a sizable number \nof members who lacked Article III injuries\u2014which \nmakes good sense, because a person simply proximate \nto an allegedly unlawful kiosk has not suffered any \nconcrete injury.  But applying binding Ninth Circuit \nprecedent, both courts concluded that this simply did \nnot matter for purposes of Article III or Rule 23(b)(3). \n\n \n4 \n \n \nThe Ninth Circuit\u2019s lax approach to certification\u2014\nrejected one way or the other by about half the \ncircuits, and adopted by the rest\u2014is wrong twice over. \nFor one, Rule 23(b)(3) does not permit a putative \nclass saturated with significant numbers of uninjured \nmembers.  That rule authorizes a class only where \ncommon questions of law and fact predominate over \nindividual questions.  But when the class contains \nmembers lacking Article III injuries, it is necessary to \nseparate the harmed from the unharmed.  And those \nindividualized inquiries will inevitably overwhelm \nany common questions\u2014destroying predominance. \nFor another, Article III bars certification where the \nclass includes any members lacking a concrete injury.  \nClasses are simply procedural devices for aggregating \nclaims.  As such, an individual cannot obtain via a \nclass what he cannot obtain on his own; and if a \nperson would be unable to get through the front doors \nof a federal court independently, he cannot be \nsmuggled in through the back via a class.  A federal \ncourt has no power to assess his claim, full stop\u2014even \nif bundled with the claims of those who have standing. \nThese are not academic issues.  With class actions, \ncertification is often the ballgame.  Once a class has \nbeen certified, the typical next step is settlement, not \ntrial.  And that likelihood becomes an inevitability \nwhere the class is large and hazards colossal liability. \nAccordingly, if a plaintiff can inflate the size of a \nclass with uninjured persons, it can drive up potential \nliability, and thus manufacture leverage with which \nto extort a settlement.  The result is that weak claims \nwin, and tens-of-millions of dollars (if not more) are \nextracted from companies who have done nothing \n\n \n5 \n \n \nwrong\u2014but nonetheless cannot tolerate a massive \nlitigation risk.  And even if some of the uninjured \nmembers are filtered out on the back-end, that does \nlittle good.  By that point, the company has already \nbeen forced into a settlement with the remaining class \nmembers, which should never have happened at all.  \nAnd the lawyers will have already secured yet another \nbounty of fees for having found a new saber to rattle. \nWhether federal law tolerates this gambit has \nfractured the circuits.  And those answering yes have \nbecome hotbeds for these sorts of suits\u2014the Ninth \nCircuit (and, in particular, California) chief among \nthem.  It is essential for this Court to resolve this \ndispute and determine which part of the circuit divide \nis correct.  And this petition is an opportunity to do so. \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nA. Labcorp, PSCs, and Kiosks. \nLabcorp is a leading clinical diagnostic laboratory.  \nIt conducts millions of tests every week, roughly 20% \nof which are performed on samples collected from one \nof Labcorp\u2019s 2,000 patient service centers (PSCs). \nThis case concerns the check-in process for patients \nvisiting a Labcorp PSC.  Tens of millions of patients \nvisit PSCs every year.  In 2017, Labcorp offered \npatients an additional way to check in.  Along with \nbeing able to check in either in person at the front \ndesk of a PSC, or ahead of time online, patients would \nalso be able to check in through a new self-service \nkiosk:  A touchscreen iPad (branded a \u201cLabcorp \nExpress\u201d kiosk) that allowed patients to check in on \ntheir own on-site, without having to first go to the \nfront desk.  Kiosks have since been installed in over \n90% of PSCs. \n\n \n6 \n \n \nLabcorp understood that its kiosks would not be \naccessible to everyone.  So at the same time, Labcorp \nimproved its front desk check-in capabilities, ensuring \nthat the same \u201cexpress\u201d technology (and experience) \nwas present at both the desk and kiosk.  See \nCA9.ER.367-68, 376; see also id. at 386-87.1  Every \nPSC thus has at least one employee available who can \ncheck in patients at the front desk using the same \ntechnology employed by the kiosks.  See id. at 369-72. \nB. This Class Action. \n1. In January 2020, Luke Davis and Julian \nVargas\u2014both legally blind\u2014filed this class action \nagainst Labcorp based on their inability to use the \nself-service kiosks.  That September, the American \nCouncil of the Blind (ACB)\u2014a group representing \n20,000 blind and visually impaired persons across the \ncountry\u2014joined the suit with an amended complaint. \nPlaintiffs asserted violations of the Americans with \nDisabilities Act (ADA), the Rehabilitation Act, and the \nPatient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as well as \nCalifornia\u2019s \u201cUnruh Act.\u201d  Notably, violations of the \nADA are \u201cper se violations of the Unruh Civil Rights \nAct.\u201d  Jankey v. Lee, 290 P.3d 187, 190 (Cal. 2012).  \nAnd each Unruh Act violation triggers (at minimum) \n$4,000 in statutory damages\u2014meaning, every time \nsomeone is exposed to an ADA-violation, that is an \nindependent Unruh violation.  Cal. Civ. Code \u00a7 52(a). \nPlaintiffs pressed the same theory for all claims: On \ntheir view, Labcorp has discriminated against them  \nand other similarly situated blind individuals because \n \n1 \u201cCA9.ER\u201d refers to the Excerpts of Record filed with the \ncourt below and available at CA9 Dkt. No. 21. \n\n \n7 \n \n \nit has not made its kiosks independently  accessible to \nthe blind.  As they put it, Labcorp has \u201cdenied\u201d blind \npatients \u201cfull and equal access\u201d to their PSCs, in that \nthe \u201ctouchscreen kiosks for self-service check-in\u201d are \n\u201cinaccessible\u201d to them.  D.Ct.Doc.40 \u00b6\u00b6 4, 21-22; see \nalso Pet.App.13a-16a (describing allegations). \nTo be clear, none of the plaintiffs has alleged that \nLabcorp has denied a single patient testing or \ndiagnostic services on account of a disability.  Nor do \nthey claim that a single patient was unable to access \nthose services.  Rather, plaintiffs\u2019 suit is based \nentirely on the fact that if they choose to check in at a \nPSC, they must use the front desk rather than a kiosk. \nThe experience of named-plaintiff Julian Vargas\u2014\nthe sole representative for the damages subclass\u2014\nhelps paint the picture.  Fresh off deciding to join a \nsimilar class action against Quest Diagnostics (where \nMr. Vargas is also a named plaintiff), he made his first \never visit to a Labcorp PSC to \u201cfamiliarize\u201d himself \nwith the facility.  CA9.ER.1379, 1366.  There, a \nLabcorp attendant at the front desk told Mr. Vargas \nthat the kiosk was not independently accessible for a \nblind person, but \u201cassured\u201d him someone would be \navailable to assist him at the front desk.  Id. at 1367. \nAnd that is exactly what happened.  Days later, Mr. \nVargas made his second (and final) trip to a Labcorp, \nwhere he received front-desk assistance in \u201cthree to \nfive minutes\u201d and was processed within \u201c20 minutes \nor so.\u201d  Id. at 1374-75.  To check in, Mr. Vargas was \nrequired only to give his identification material to the \nemployee; he never needed to disclose any private \ninformation out loud.  Id. at 1372.  And on his telling, \n\n \n8 \n \n \nLabcorp staff was \u201crespectful,\u201d \u201chelpful,\u201d and provided \nhim all \u201cservices\u201d that he requested.  Id. at 1399-1400. \nThis suit was filed two weeks later. \n2. The plaintiffs have proposed two putative \nclasses: A nationwide injunctive class, premised on \ntheir federal claims; and a California damages \nsubclass, premised on their Unruh Act claim.  The \nclass definitions that were ultimately approved by the \ndistrict court\u2014and are at issue here\u2014are as follows: \nThe Nationwide Class: All legally blind \nindividuals who visited a LabCorp patient \nservice center with a LabCorp Express Self-\nService kiosk in the United States during the \napplicable limitations period, and who, due to \ntheir disability, were unable to use the \nLabCorp Express Self-Service kiosk. \nThe California Subclass: All legally blind \nindividuals who visited a LabCorp patient \nservice center with a LabCorp Express Self-\nService kiosk in California during the \napplicable limitations period and who, due to \ntheir disability, were unable to use the \nLabCorp Express Self-Service kiosk. \nPet.App.63a. \nAs the plaintiffs themselves explained, both of these \nclasses are defined to cover any legally blind person \nwho has been \u201cexposed\u201d to an allegedly ADA-violative \nkiosk\u2014regardless of whether the patient knew about \nor wanted to use one.  See 9th.Cir.Doc.32 at 35, 38, 41.  \nClass membership instead turns on \u201c(1) whether a \nLabCorp Express kiosk was in use on site on the date \nof [a patient\u2019s] visit and (2) whether [that patient] is \nlegally blind.\u201d  Id. at 39-40.  Plaintiffs conceded their \n\n \n9 \n \n \nclasses did not \u201cexclude uninjured members,\u201d and that \nthey were defined to reach beyond those who have \nsuffered a concrete \u201cinjury-in-fact\u201d\u2014i.e., broader than \nthose who have tried or wanted to use a kiosk.  Id. at \n60 (arguing any issues about \u201clegal injury and injury-\nin-fact\u201d should be resolved after certification). \nAnd critically, that is not a small portion of either \nclass.  Unrebutted record evidence showed that nearly \none-fourth of all Labcorp PSC visitors prefer to check \nin at the front desk; and another tenth preferred to do \nso online.  CA9.ER.509.  And there is every indication \nthat for blind patients in particular, those figures are \neven higher.  As the American Council of the Blind\u2019s \ncorporate representative noted in her deposition, their \npreferred option was to have \u201ca staff member be \navailable to check in people\u201d at the facility.  See id. at \n406.  Indeed, the ACB surveyed 4,542 members about \nany experience with Labcorp\u2019s kiosks.  Only twelve \nmembers offered any response.  Id. at 398-99, 455. \nThe individual record evidence tells the same story.  \nTake ACB member John Harden.  Mr. Harden is a \nregular patient at Labcorp.  Id. at 410-12.  He stated \nthat he did not even know there was a kiosk available, \nuntil being asked about it in the ACB survey.  Id. at \n452.  Instead, his preferred mode of check-in is the \nfront desk, which he has happily used for years.  Id.; \nid. at 411-12.  In his words: The ADA says a \u201cbusiness \nneeds to make reasonable accommodations for the \ndisabled,\u201d and Labcorp \u201ccertainly\u201d does so. Id. at 413. \n3.  For all of this, plaintiffs seek injunctive relief as \nwell as damages (plus, of course, attorneys\u2019 fees).  As \nto the former, plaintiffs are demanding a nationwide \ninjunction that requires Labcorp to make its kiosks \n\n \n10 \n \n \nindependently accessible to the blind.  Id. at 683.  As \nfor the latter, plaintiffs do \u201cnot seek class recovery for \nactual damages, personal injuries or emotional \ndistress,\u201d D.Ct.Doc.40 \u00b6 36; they seek only statutory \ndamages under the Unruh Act, which is $4,000 for \neach independent ADA violation, see Pet.App.34a. \nAccording to the plaintiffs, their nationwide class is \nas many as 676,566 people per year.  CA9.ER.557.  \nAnd their damages subclass\u2014which, again, is limited \nto the Unruh Act, and thus California\u2014is as many as \n112,140 people per year.  Id.  Given the Unruh Act\u2019s \nstatutory damages, that could amount to nearly half \na billion dollars of liability per year.  Id. at 556-557. \nC. The District Court Certifies the Classes. \nIn April 2021, following months of discovery, the \nplaintiffs moved to certify both of their classes under \nRule 23.  That rule requires plaintiffs to show two \nthings: First, their putative class satisfies the general \nrequirements of Rule 23(a) (numerosity, commonality, \ntypicality, and adequacy); and second, their class fits \nwithin one of the three categories listed by Rule 23(b). \nOn May 23, 2022, the district court certified both of \nthe proposed classes.  It found that both classes \nsatisfied Rule 23(a), and that each class qualified for \none of the Rule 23(b) provisions.  Pet.App.18a-43a. \nAs for the damages subclass, the district court held \nthat the plaintiffs satisfied Rule 23(b)(3)\u2014which \nauthorizes a class where, among other things, \n\u201cquestions of law or fact common to the class members \npredominate over any questions affecting individual \nmembers.\u201d  The court agreed it was unclear how many \nclass members even \u201cpersonally encountered\u201d a \nkiosk\u2014i.e., even potentially suffered some injury-in-\n\n \n11 \n \n \nfact.  Pet.App.34a-36a.  And it agreed individualized \nfindings would be required to \u201cconfirm\u201d who would \nultimately be \u201celigib[le]\u201d for relief.  Id.  But the court \nheld this did not destroy predominance because the \nclass still involved a range of common issues (e.g., how \nthe kiosks worked).  And when it came to the actual \nsize of the class and which class members were \nharmed, resolution of that critical issue could wait \nuntil  \u201cclass wide liability has been determined.\u201d  Id. \nThe court also certified the nationwide injunctive \nclass under Rule 23(b)(2)\u2014which allows a class where \na \u201csingle injunction or declaratory judgment would \nprovide relief to each member of the class.\u201d  \nPet.App.27a (quoting Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, \n564 U.S. 338, 360 (2011)).  The court reasoned that \neven though the plaintiffs did not offer a single way to \n\u201caccommodate every person everywhere,\u201d it was still \npossible to tailor an injunction \u201cgenerally applicable \nto the class as a whole.\u201d Pet.App.28a.  And the court \nalso held that it did not matter if \u201csome class members \nmay have suffered no injury\u201d at all\u2014that was an issue \nfor later, and did not bar certification.  Pet.App.29a. \nOn September 22, 2022, the Ninth Circuit granted \nLabcorp\u2019s Rule 23(f) motion to file an interlocutory \nappeal challenging the district court\u2019s certification \ndecisions.  The district court then stayed proceedings. \nD. The Ninth Circuit Affirms. \nOn February 8, 2024, the Ninth Circuit affirmed \nboth of the district court\u2019s class-certification decisions \nin an unpublished order dictated by circuit precedent. \nAs relevant, the Ninth Circuit first held that Article \nIII posed no bar to certifying either class.  Pet.App.2a-\n\n \n12 \n \n \n4a.2  Applying existing circuit case law, the court held \nthat it did not matter if \u201csome potential class members \nmay not have been injured.\u201d  Pet.App.2a-7a & n.1 \n(citing Olean Wholesale Grocery Coop. Inc. v. Bumble \nBee Foods, 31 F.4th 651, 668-69 (9th Cir. 2022) (en \nbanc)).  A named plaintiff (Vargas) was injured, and \nthat \u201cconvey[ed]\u201d standing on the class.  Pet.App.4a. \nAs for Rule 23(b)(3)\u2019s predominance requirement\u2014\nwhich applies only to the damages subclass\u2014the court \nheld that the fact the class might contain numerous \nuninjured persons did not destroy predominance.  See \nPet.App.4a-5a.  Labcorp argued that filtering out \nthese members may involve many \u201cindividualized\u201d \ninquiries.  Id.  But under binding circuit law, this too \ndid not matter: Rule 23(b) does not bar \u201ccertification \nof a class that potentially includes more than a de \nminimis  number of uninjured class members.\u201d  \nPet.App.5a n.1 (quoting Olean, 31 F.4th at 668).   \nOn April 18, 2024, the Ninth Circuit declined \nrehearing en banc.  Pet.App.10a-11a. \n \n \n2 The Ninth Circuit acknowledged the district court did not \n\u201cdirectly address standing in either of its class-certification \norders.\u201d  Pet.App.3a.  That is so even though Labcorp raised the \nissue\u2014namely, regarding the damages subclass.  CA9.ER.1614; \nid. at 262-63 (discussing and attaching TransUnion). \n\n \n13 \n \n \nREASONS FOR GRANTING THE PETITION \nThis petition asks a question that sharply divides \nthe circuits, implicates billions of dollars, and has \nalready once captured this Court\u2019s attention.  It is \nhard to imagine a better issue for this Court\u2019s review. \nI. \nTHE CIRCUITS ARE DEEPLY SPLIT OVER THE \nQUESTION PRESENTED. \nCourts and commentators agree: The federal courts \nof appeals are divided over what to do about proposed \nclasses where some class members lack any Article III \ninjury.  See, e.g., In re Asacol Antitrust Litig., 907 F.3d \n42, 46 (1st Cir. 2018) (\u201cthe presence of uninjured class \nmembers\u201d is a \u201cproblem that has been the source of \nmuch debate among the circuits\u201d); Neale v. Volvo Cars \nof N. Am., LLC, 794 F.3d 353, 365-67 (3d Cir. 2015) \n(listing differing \u201csister courts\u201d); In re Deepwater \nHorizon, 739 F.3d 790, 800-01 (5th Cir. 2014) \n(identifying \u201croughly even split of circuit authority\u201d).3 \nBroadly speaking, when faced with the question of \nhow many uninjured people can be in a putative class, \n \n3 See also 1 William B. Rubenstein, Newberg and Rubenstein \non Class Actions \u00a7 2:3 (6th ed. 2024) (this issue is an \u201cunresolved \nquestion that has generated differing approaches\u201d across the \ncircuits); 8 Julian O. von Kalinowski et al., Antitrust Laws and \nTrade Regulation \u00a7 166.03[4][b][ii] (2d ed. 2024) (\u201cThe Courts of \nAppeals have divided on whether certification must be denied \nwhere the proposed class includes persons who have suffered no \ninjury.\u201d); 1 Joseph M. McLaughlin, McLaughlin on Class Actions \n\u00a7 4:28 (20th ed. 2023) (\u201c[B]roadly speaking the circuits have \nfollowed two distinct approaches in evaluating standing for class \ncertification purposes.\u201d); Theane Evangelis & Bradley J. \nHamburger, Article III Standing and Absent Class Members, 64 \nEmory L.J. 383, 387 (2014) (\u201c[T]he courts of appeals are divided \non whether absent class members also must satisfy Article III.\u201d). \n\n \n14 \n \n \nthe circuits break into three camps.  Some say none, \nholding that Article III bars certification where the \nclass includes anyone who lacks standing; others say \njust a de minimis amount, holding that Rule 23(b)(3) \npermits nothing greater; and the rest say anything \nless than a really big number, holding that problems \ninvolving uninjured class members can usually be \nresolved down the road.  In all events, there is a \u201cdeep \nsplit on this issue\u201d\u2014which will persist until this Court \ndecides to \u201cresolve this.\u201d  In re Deepwater Horizon, 753 \nF.3d 516, 521 (5th Cir. 2014) (Clement, J., dissental). \nA. The Article III Circuits. \nOne circuit bloc views the question presented \nthrough a constitutional lens, and holds that a class \nmay not be certified where it includes members who \nhave suffered no Article III injury.  On this view, a \nclass is simply a tool for aggregating claims; and if a \nclaim would fail on its own for lack of standing, then \nit cannot get before a federal court via a class device. \nSecond Circuit.  The Second Circuit was the first \ncourt of appeals to squarely hold that \u201cno class may be \ncertified that contains members lacking Article III \nstanding.\u201d  Denney v. Deutsche Bank AG, 443 F.3d \n253, 264 (2d Cir. 2006).  And for that reason, any \n\u201cclass must therefore be defined in such a way that \nanyone within it would have standing.\u201d  Id. at 265; see \nalso, e.g., In re Foreign Exchange Benchmark \nAntitrust Litig., 2022 WL 3971006, at *3-4 (S.D.N.Y. \n2022) (applying Denney to analyze definition of class). \nEighth Circuit.  The Eighth Circuit has followed \nsuit, endorsing Denney.  Avritt v. Reliastar Life Ins. \nCo., 615 F.3d 1023, 1034 (8th Cir. 2010) (\u201c[A] named \nplaintiff cannot represent a class of persons who lack \n\n \n15 \n \n \nthe ability to bring a suit themselves.\u201d).  And that \ncourt has since reaffirmed its position.  Johannessohn \nv. Polaris Indus. Inc., 9 F.4th 981, 988 & n.3 (8th Cir. \n2021) (\u201c[A] class cannot be certified where it is defined \nin such a way to include individuals who lack \nstanding.\u201d); Halvorson v. Auto-Owners Life Ins. Co., \n718 F.3d 773, 778 (8th Cir. 2013) (\u201cIn order for a class \nto be certified, each member must have standing.\u201d). \nOther Circuits.  While the Second and Eighth are \nthe clearest adherents to the Article III position, \nothers have lent support too.  For instance, the Sixth \nCircuit endorsed this view in an unpublished opinion.  \nSee In re Carpenter Co., 2014 WL 12809636, at *2 (6th \nCir. 2014) (certification turns on \u201cwhether the \ndefinition of the class is sufficiently narrow to exclude \nuninjured parties\u201d) (citing Denney and Halvorson). \nLikewise, while the Fifth Circuit has not squarely \naddressed whether the presence of uninjured class \nmembers presents an Article III problem, some of its \njudges have embraced this position.  See Flecha v. \nMedicredit, Inc., 946 F.3d 762, 770-71 (5th Cir. 2020) \n(Oldham, J., concurring) (\u201cIf anything, I\u2019d think our \nstanding analysis would be particularly rigorous at \nthis stage, given the transformative nature of the \nclass-certification \ndecision.\u201d); \nIn \nre \nDeepwater \nHorizon, 732 F.3d 326, 340-42 (5th Cir. 2013) (opinion \nof Clement, J.) (\u201cA claimant must actually have a legal \nclaim before getting in line for a legal recovery.\u201d). \nAccordingly, at least in the Second and Eighth \nCircuits (and with certain panels in the Fifth and \nSixth), plaintiffs\u2019 class action would never have been \ncertified: Neither of the proposed classes was tailored \n\n \n16 \n \n \nto exclude members lacking Article III injuries.  That \nalone would have been fatal in these courts of appeals. \nB. The De Minimis Circuits. \nAnother set of appellate courts has approached the \nissue through the lens of Rule 23(b)(3), not Article III.  \nThese circuits have strictly applied Rule 23(b)(3)\u2019s \npredominance requirement to reject classes that \ncontain more than a de minimis number of uninjured \nmembers.  Of these circuits, some have reserved \nwhether certifying a class with uninjured members \nraises a constitutional defect, while others have \nrejected this Article III argument.  Cf. Amchem \nProducts, Inc. v. Windsor, 521 U.S. 591, 612 (1997) \n(\u201cclass \ncertification \nissues\u201d \ncan \nbe \n\u201clogically \nantecedent to the existence of any Article III issues\u201d). \nD.C. Circuit.  The D.C. Circuit has come close to \nholding that a class must be defined in a way where \neveryone in it has Article III standing\u2014but it has not \nexpressly done so.  In re Rail Freight Fuel Surcharge \nAntitrust Litig., 725 F.3d 244, 252 (D.C. Cir. 2013) \n(\u201cThe plaintiffs must also show that they can prove, \nthrough common evidence, that all class members \nwere in fact injured by the alleged conspiracy.\u201d). \nIn a recent opinion by Judge Katsas, though, the \nD.C. Circuit rejected on Rule 23(b)(3) grounds a class \nthat was defined to reach uninjured members.  As the \ncourt put it: \u201cUninjured class members cannot prevail \non the merits, so their claims must be winnowed away \nas part of the liability determination.  And that \nprospect raises [the question]\u2014when does the need for \nindividualized proof of injury and causation destroy \npredominance?\u201d  In re Rail Freight Fuel Surcharge \nAntitrust Litig., 934 F.3d 619, 624 (D.C. Cir. 2019). \n\n \n17 \n \n \nJudge Katsas answered that question for the D.C. \nCircuit by holding that, at the least, a class cannot be \ncertified if it contains more than a \u201cde minimis\u201d \nnumber of members lacking an Article III injury.  Id. \nat 625.  And because the class there plainly did so, the \ncourt held that certification was improper.  Id. at 626. \nFirst Circuit.  By contrast, the First Circuit has \nexpressly rejected the position that Article III bars \nclass certification where the class is defined to include \nthose lacking standing.  See In re Nexium Litig., 777 \nF.3d 9, 31-32 (1st Cir. 2015) (holding that only the \nnamed plaintiffs must have standing for certification). \nEven so, the First Circuit has similarly taken a \nstrict approach to class certification by insisting that \na class cannot contain more than a de minimis \nnumber (in its words, a \u201cvery small absolute number\u201d) \nof uninjured persons if it wants to satisfy Rule \n23(b)(3)\u2019s predominance requirement.  See Asacol, 907 \nF.3d at 53-54 (decertifying class exceeding this limit).4 \nAccordingly, just as above\u2014at least with respect to \ntheir half-billion-dollar-per-year damages subclass\u2014\nplaintiffs\u2019 suit would not have been able to get off the \nground in either the D.C. or First Circuits.  Neither \ncourt below even suggested that the damages subclass \nhere contains only a de minimis number of uninjured \npersons.  See Pet.App.34a-38a; Pet.App.4a-7a & n.1.  \nRather, as discussed next, that deficiency is simply \n \n4 The Third Circuit appears to follow the same approach as \nthe First, rejecting the Article III position, but strictly enforcing \nRule 23(b)(3)\u2019s predominance requirement.  Neale, 794 F.3d at \n362, 365 (rejecting Article III view); In re Lamictal Direct \nPurchaser Antitrust Litig., 957 F.3d 184, 194-94 (3d Cir. 2020) \n(rejecting class with non-trivial number of uninjured members). \n\n \n18 \n \n \nkkirrelevant under Ninth Circuit precedent.  See \nOlean, 31 F.4th at 692 (Lee, J., dissenting) (explaining \nNinth Circuit has split from at least D.C. and First \nCircuits). \nC. The Back-End Circuits. \nBreaking from the above, the remaining courts of \nappeals have held that the presence of uninjured class \nmembers should not ordinarily prevent certification:  \nOn this view, uninjured members present no Article \nIII problem; and there is a Rule 23(b)(3) issue only if \nthere is a really large number of uninjured members.  \nFor these courts, issues concerning member standing \nare addressed on the back-end, following certification. \nNinth Circuit.  Principal among these circuits is \nthe Ninth Circuit.  As this case shows, that court does \nnot believe there is any Article III impediment to \ncertifying a class that includes members without any \nArticle III injury.  See also, e.g., Ruiz Torres v. Mercer \nCanyons Inc., 835 F.3d 1125, 1137 n.6 (9th Cir. 2016). \nMoreover, unlike the D.C. and First Circuits, the \nNinth Circuit has expressly rejected the notion that a \nclass cannot \u201cinclude[] more than a de minimis \nnumber of uninjured class members.\u201d  Olean, 31 F.4th \nat 669; see also id. at 691-92 (Lee, J., dissenting).  On \nthat court\u2019s view, whether a class member has in fact \nbeen harmed is no different from any other question; \nand accordingly, it is possible for other questions of \nlaw and fact to predominate, even if \u201cindividualized \ninquiries\u201d as to standing are needed later.  Id. at 668.5 \n \n5 The Fourth Circuit has favorably cited Olean, and has held \nthat only the named plaintiffs must have Article III standing in \n \n\n \n19 \n \n \nSeventh Circuit.  Likewise, the Seventh Circuit \nhas rejected the Article III position.  See Kohen v. Pac. \nInv. Mgmt. Co., 571 F.3d 672, 677 (7th Cir. 2009).  And \nit has also gone further than the de minimis courts, \nholding that the Rule 23(b)(3) predominance line is \ncrossed only if a \u201cgreat many\u201d of the class members \nare unharmed.  Id. at 677; see Messner v. Northshore \nUniv. HealthSystem, 669 F.3d 802, 825 (7th Cir. 2012) \n(\u201cThere is no precise measure for \u2018a great many.\u2019\u201d).6 \nEleventh Circuit.  The Eleventh Circuit is of a \npiece.  It holds that only the \u201cnamed plaintiff must \nhave standing\u201d for a class to be certified.  Cordoba v. \nDIRECTV, LLC, 942 F.3d 1259, 1267 (11th Cir. 2019).  \nAnd while it has recognized that the standing of \nunnamed members is \u201cexceedingly relevant to the \nclass certification analysis\u201d under Rule 23(b)(3), id. at \n1273, it has said a class fails predominance only where \na \u201clarge portion\u201d of members lack injury, id. at 1277. \nII. THE DECISION BELOW IS WRONG. \nThe Ninth Circuit\u2019s hyper-permissive approach to \ncertification is wrong.  In failing to require tailored \nclasses from the start, that court razes the barriers to \ncertification that are included within Rule 23(b)(3), \nwhich this Court has told the lower courts to guard \n\u201crigorous[ly].\u201d  Wal-Mart, 564 U.S. at 350-351.  And in \nso doing, the Ninth Circuit begets a serious Article III \n \norder for a federal court to certify a proposed class.  See Carolina \nYouth Action Project v. Wilson, 60 F.4th 770, 779 (4th Cir. 2023).   \n6 The Tenth Circuit has favorably cited Kohen.  See DG ex rel. \nStricklin v. Devaughn, 594 F.3d 1188, 1201 (10th Cir. 2010).  And \ndistrict courts within that circuit have expressly adopted that \ndecision\u2019s \u201cgreat many\u201d test for deciding predominance.  See, e.g., \nIn re EpiPen Litig., 2020 WL 1180550, at *30-32 (D. Kan. 2020). \n\n \n20 \n \n \ninfirmity, because a federal court has no power to \nadjudicate a class\u2019s claims, where some of those claims \nare from those without standing.  Thus under both \nRule 23(b)(3) and Article III, the Ninth Circuit\u2019s \napproach harbors fundamental defects.  See Amchem, \n521 U.S. at 612.  This Court\u2019s review is badly needed. \nRule 23(b)(3).  Rule 23(b)(3) says a class cannot be \ncertified unless \u201ccommon\u201d questions \u201cpredominate\u201d \nover \u201cindividual\u201d ones.  Questions regarding Article \nIII standing are quintessentially individual\u2014turning \non a person\u2019s own experience and intent.  So where a \nclass is defined in a way where it is necessary to later \nparse members with standing from those without, the \nRule 23(b)(3) question becomes \u201chow many\u201d of these \n\u201cindividualized adjudications\u201d are \u201ctoo many,\u201d before \na putative class is no longer defined by common \nissues.  In re Rail Freight, 934 F.3d at 624 (Katsas, J.). \nThe Ninth Circuit has set that number very high; \nand as this case shows, has tolerated proposed classes \nwhere thousands of individualized inquiries may be \nnecessary.  That is mistaken.  Foremost, the Ninth \nCircuit\u2019s approach conflicts with Rule 23\u2019s text; after \nall, the plain meaning of \u201cpredominate\u201d compels that \n\u201cRule 23 allows a de minimis number of uninjured \nmembers but no more.\u201d  Olean, 31 F.4th at 692 (Lee, \nJ., dissenting).  But more fundamental, the Ninth \nCircuit\u2019s lax approach conflicts with the principles \nand protections that animate Rule 23(b)(3). \nAs this Court has underscored, Rule 23(b)(3) classes \nwere an \u201cadventuresome innovation\u201d that markedly \nexpanded the \u201cset of circumstances\u201d where a class was \navailable.  Wal-Mart, 564 U.S. at 362.  And with that \ninnovation comes consequences: Certifying a Rule \n\n \n21 \n \n \n23(b)(3) class is a \u201ctransformative\u201d decision\u2014one that \n\u201cdramatically change[s]\u201d the size, nature, and stakes \nof a particular suit.  Flecha, 946 F.3d at 770 (Oldham, \nJ., concurring).  It can \u201cchange the number of \nplaintiffs from one to one million,\u201d and turn an \nindividual action into bet-the-company litigation.  Id. \nGiven these effects, Rule 23(b)(3) pairs its greater \nscope with \u201cgreater procedural protections.\u201d  Wal-\nMart, 564 U.S. at 362.  The most important of these is \nits predominance requirement\u2014which ensures a \nproposed class is \u201csufficiently cohesive to warrant \nadjudication by representation.\u201d  Amchem, 521 U.S. at \n623.  Before a plaintiff can wield the sword of \ncollective liability, it must come to federal court with \na class made up of common claims by valid claimants.  \nThis showing is not supposed to be easy.  Instead, it \nis demanding by design.  Wal-Mart, 564 U.S. at 350-\n51; see also Comcast Corp. v. Behrend, 569 U.S. 27, 34 \n(2013).  In particular, when reviewing a proposed Rule \n23(b)(3) class, a court must ensure that certification \nwould not undermine \u201cprocedural fairness,\u201d or hazard \n\u201cother undesirable results.\u201d  Amchem, 521 U.S. at 615. \nAs the D.C. and First Circuits have correctly held, \nthese principles compel a de minimis rule\u2014i.e., a clear \nrule that if a proposed class may contain uninjured \nmembers at all, it cannot harbor more than a de \nminimis number of them.  Anything looser vitiates the \nprocedural safeguards placed within Rule 23(b)(3). \nMost of all, rejecting the de minimis rule inevitably \n\u201cinvite[s] plaintiffs to concoct oversized classes stuffed \nwith uninjured class members,\u201d which enables them \nto \u201cinflate the potential liability  (and ratchet up the \nattorney\u2019s fees based in part on that amount) to \n\n \n22 \n \n \nextract a settlement, even if the merits of their claims \nare questionable.\u201d  Olean, 31 F.4th at 692 (Lee, J., \ndissenting).  In other words, it allows Rule 23(b)(3)\u2019s \nprocedural device for aggregating claims to be \ntransformed into a tool for manufacturing them\u2014all \nin service of extracting an \u201cin terrorem\u201d settlement, as \nsoon as the proposed class has been certified.  AT&T \nMobility LLC v. Concepcion, 563 U.S. 333, 350 (2011). \nFor everyone outside the plaintiffs\u2019 bar, that is not \ngood\u2014and brings about exactly what Rule 23(b)(3) is \nsupposed to prevent.  It is not procedurally \u201cfair\u201d for a \nplaintiff to be able to use a device like the class action \nto conjure settlement leverage.  Nor is it \u201cdesirable\u201d \nfor the rule of law (or the economy) when a company \nsheathes an otherwise viable defense\u2014and allows a \nlosing claim to prevail\u2014because the risks of litigating \na sprawling class action are just too high to endure. \nFor its part, the Ninth Circuit has put little stock in \nall this.  On its view, questions of member standing \nare no different from any other question of law or fact; \nand Rule 23(b)(3) can be satisfied, even in the face of \npotentially thousands of individualized standing \ninquiries, so long as other common questions \npredominate.  See Olean, 31 F.4th at 669.  But that is \nflawed even on its own terms.  As the above lays bare, \nquestions of member standing are different in kind \nfrom rote questions of law or fact (e.g., how a kiosk \nworks).  This because they go to the size of the class \nand, in turn, the specter of liability.  Excusing a class \nwith uninjured members\u2014even if there are other \ncommon questions\u2014thus presents a distinct defect.  It \n\u201ctilts the playing field in favor of plaintiffs\u201d by giving \nthem leverage to \u201cextract a settlement\u201d upon \ncertification.  Id. at 692 (Lee, J., dissenting).  And that \n\n \n23 \n \n \ndirectly imperils the protections and principles \nunderlying Rule 23(b)(3). \nAccordingly, when it comes to proposed classes that \nharbor members lacking any Article III injury, the \nbetter course is to guard Rule 23(b)(3)\u2019s predominance \nrequirement jealously.  If a class can have uninjured \nmembers at all, the number of members lacking \nArticle III standing must be no more than de minimis, \nlest a procedural device for pooling common claims is \ntransformed into a cudgel for extorting settlements. \nArticle III.  The Ninth Circuit\u2019s approach to class \ncertification fails for another threshold reason: Article \nIII precludes a federal court from certifying a class \nwhose members lack an Article III injury.  Article III \nstanding is a \u201cbedrock constitutional requirement \nthat this Court has applied to all manner of important \ndisputes.\u201d  United States v. Texas, 599 U.S. 670, 675 \n(2023).  And class actions are no exception.  \nTransUnion LLC v. Ramirez, 594 U.S. at 430-31.  A \nclass member thus must satisfy Article III\u2014just like \nany other litigant. \nIndeed, a class action is just a procedural device: It \nis simply a \u201cmethod[] for bringing about aggregation \nof claims.\u201d  Sprint Commc\u2019ns Co. v. APCC Servs., Inc., \n554 U.S 269, 291 (2008).  It does not (and cannot) alter \nthe substantive rights of litigants; and it leaves a class \nmember with the same \u201crights and duties\u201d he would \nhave if he sued on his own.  Shady Grove Orthopedic \nAssocs., P.A. v. Allstate Ins. Co., 559 U.S. 393, 406-07 \n(2010).  In other words, a class member cannot obtain \nvia a class device what he cannot get by going it alone. \nThat settles the standing question.  This Court has \nalready explained that \u201cArticle III does not give \n\n \n24 \n \n \nfederal courts the power to order relief to any \nuninjured plaintiff, class action or not.\u201d  TransUnion, \n594 U.S. at 431.  But if a member cannot get relief at \nthe end of the suit, he cannot get an adjudication on \nthe merits of his claim beforehand\u2014as would occur, \nfor instance, in a class action where the liability phase \nis bifurcated from damages.  See California v. Texas, \n593 U.S. 659, 671-72 (2021).  That would amount to \nan advisory opinion: A ruling on a party\u2019s legal \nquestion when it has no concrete stake in the dispute. \nIt does not matter that uninjured members happen \nto be pooled together with injured members.  Again, a \nclass action is just a device for aggregating individual \nclaims; it does not change the nature of those claims, \nnor alter what they must show to get into federal \ncourt.  Rather, it is akin to other procedural tools like \njoinder, consolidation, or intervention.  See Shady \nGrove, 559 U.S. at 408.  And as this Court has already \nheld in the context of Rule 24 intervention\u2014applying \nthe very logic above\u2014a litigant \u201cmust demonstrate \nArticle III standing\u201d to participate in a case when that \nlitigant seeks independent relief, such as \u201cseparate \nmonetary relief.\u201d  Town of Chester v. Laroe Estates, \nInc., 581 U.S. 433, 439-440 (2017). \nThe same rules apply here.  Class members are not \namici or bystanders.  Once a class is certified and a \nputative member declines to opt-out, that member\u2019s \nclaim becomes part of the case.  See Devlin v. \nScardelletti, 536 U.S. 1, 7-10 (2002).  And because that \nclaim seeks relief in the member\u2019s \u201cown name[],\u201d that \nmember must have \u201cstanding.\u201d  Laroe Estates, 581 \nU.S. at 440.  That is, even though Rule 23 affords \nunnamed class members the luxury of having their \nclaims adjudicated without their direct participation, \n\n \n25 \n \n \nit does not reduce the Article III hurdles they must \nclear for their claims to be heard in the first place. \nAnd that is true regardless of the form of relief \nsought\u2014i.e., whether it is an injunctive class (under \nRule 23(b)(2)), or damages class (under Rule 23(b)(3)).  \nArticle III applies irrespective of remedy; a plaintiff \nmust have standing for any relief\u2014legal or equitable. \nTo be sure, this Court has at times allowed a case \nto proceed where at least one plaintiff can establish \nstanding.  But the rationale in those cases is that in \nawarding relief to one party, the incidental effect of \nthat judgment would provide complete relief to the \nother parties\u2014alleviating any need to render a \n\u201cjudgment\u201d in their cases.  Baggett v. Bullitt, 377 U.S. \n360, 366 n.5 (1964).  With a Rule 23(b)(2) injunctive \nclass, by contrast, the court is adjudicating the claims \nof unnamed members, rendering a judgment in their \ncase, and providing a legal remedy that formally runs \nfrom the defendant to those parties.  That is different \nin kind, and presents a distinct Article III infirmity. \nIf anything, certifying a Rule 23(b)(2) class with \nmembers lacking Article III standing is especially \nproblematic, because that rule authorizes a class only \nwhere \u201cfinal injunctive relief \u2026 is appropriate \nrespecting the class as a whole.\u201d  But where (as here) \na class is defined to encompass members without \nArticle III standing, injunctive relief cannot be \n\u201cappropriate\u201d for the \u201cwhole\u201d class because the whole \nclass is not eligible to receive such relief. \nAccordingly, in order for a class to be certified, the \nplaintiff must define its class in a way that all class \nmembers have Article III standing and offer common \nevidence to show that those members have indeed \n\n \n26 \n \n \nsuffered an injury-in-fact on a classwide basis.  After \nall, certification is not a \u201cmere pleading\u201d exercise; a \nparty seeking class certification must \u201caffirmatively \ndemonstrate\u201d that its offered class really satisfies the \nrequirements for one.  Wal-Mart, 564 U.S. at 350-51.  \nAnd that includes showing that class members\u2014i.e., \nthe individual claimants who will also be part of the \nfederal proceeding\u2014have Article III standing.  See \n7AA Charles Alan Wright et al., Federal Practice and \nProcedure \u00a7 17851.1 (3d ed. 2024) (\u201c[T]o avoid a \ndismissal based on a lack of standing, the court must \nbe able to find that both the class and the \nrepresentatives have suffered [an Article III] injury\u201d); \nsee also, e.g., Lujan v. Defs. of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, \n561 (1992) (plaintiff bears the burden of showing \nstanding at each \u201csuccessive stage[] of the litigation\u201d). \nThe Ninth Circuit\u2019s decision to affirm certification \nof the two classes here thus cannot be squared with \nArticle III\u2019s demands.  Again, the classes here are not \neven defined in a way that excludes uninjured \nmembers.  And undisputed record evidence makes \nplain those classes are stuffed with such persons.  \nNeither court below disputed this; they just said it did \nnot matter.  That was marked error. \nIII. THIS QUESTION PRESENTED IS ONE OF \u201cGREAT \nIMPORTANCE.\u201d \nThe deep division across the circuits over this issue \ndoes not concern some trifling matter.  It is a question, \nin this Court\u2019s words, of \u201cgreat importance.\u201d  Tyson \nFoods, Inc. v. Bouaphakeo, 577 U.S. 442, 461 (2016).  \nIndeed, in Tyson Foods, this Court agreed to answer \nthe question presented\u2014granting certiorari to settle \n\u201cwhether a class may be certified if it contains \n\n \n27 \n \n \nmembers who were not injured and have no legal right \nto any [relief].\u201d  Id. at 460.  But the Tyson Foods Court \nultimately opted against doing so because the \npetitioner pressed an entirely \u201cnew argument\u201d in its \nmerits briefing\u2014scrapping any focus on certification, \nand shifting its attention wholly to whether uninjured \nmembers may obtain relief post-judgment.  Id. at 460-\n61; see also TransUnion, 594 U.S. at 431 n.4.   \nNevertheless, if the question presented was worthy \nof this Court\u2019s review in 2016, it is even more so now.  \nIndeed, the division among the circuits has only \ngotten worse.  And the practical reasons for the Court \nto intervene have only proliferated in the last decade. \nIn fact, class actions have mushroomed in recent \nyears, swelling to where \u201caround 10,000\u201d are filed \nannually.  Olean, 31 F.4th at 686 (Lee, J., dissenting).  \nThe costs of these suits have exploded too.  Simply \ndefending class actions is set to top $4 billion for the \nfirst time this year.  2024 Carlton Fields Class Action \nSurvey, at 7 (2024), https://perma.cc/U3TX-X84E.  \nSingle suits can cost tens of millions to litigate. \nADA actions like the one here are a prime example \nof this broader phenomenon.  In 2013, fewer than \n3,000 such suits a year were filed; now, it is closer to \n10,000.  Minh Vu, Kristina Launey, & Susan Ryan, \nADA Title III Federal Lawsuit Filings Hit An All Time \nHigh, \nSeyfarth \nShaw \nLLP \n(Feb \n17, \n2022), \nhttps://perma.cc/NJZ5-LK3Y.  And of those, California \nis home to half\u2014which makes sense, because the \nUnruh Act, as noted, makes ADA violations per se \n\n \n28 \n \n \nUnruh Act violations, to the hefty tune of (at \nminimum) $4,000 per violation.  See id.7 \nMoreover, as class actions get bigger and bigger (as \nwell as more frequent), everything increasingly comes \ndown to the class-certification decision.  Once a class \nis certified, \u201cextensive discovery and the potential for \nuncertainty and disruption in a lawsuit allow \nplaintiffs with weak claims to extort settlements from \ninnocent companies.\u201d  Stoneridge Inv. Partners v. Sci.-\nAtlanta, 552 U.S. 148, 163 (2008).  The \u201c[c]ertification \nof the class is often, if not usually, the prelude to a \nsubstantial settlement by the defendant because the \ncosts and risks of litigating further are so high.\u201d  \nAmgen Inc. v. Conn. Ret. Plans & Tr. Funds, 568 U.S. \n455, 485 (2013) (Scalia, J., dissenting); see also, e.g., \nOlean, 31 F.4th at 686 (Lee, J., dissenting) (similar). \nCritically, this risk of \u201c\u2018in terrorem\u2019 settlements\u201d is \nnot something that can be alleviated on the back end.  \nConcepcion, 563 U.S. at 350.  That a federal court may \nseparate injured from uninjured members before \nawarding individual relief does little to save a \ncompany from needing to settle in the first place.  At \nbottom, it is the very specter of liability that forces a \nbusiness to give up.  Companies often must measure \nrisk against the worst-case scenario\u2014and where the \nplaintiffs can inflate the upper end of liability with an \nindeterminate number of uninjured members, even a \nremote possibility of loss becomes intolerable. \n \n7 The ADA is by no means the only example.  See, e.g., Stuart \nL. Pardau, Good Intentions and the Road to Regulatory Hell: How \nthe TCPA Went from Consumer Protection Statute to Litigation \nNightmare, 2018 U. Ill. J.L. Tech. & Pol\u2019y 313, 321-22 & n.71. \n\n \n29 \n \n \nTo make matters worse, even if courts are able to \nfilter out uninjured members on the back end, that \nordinarily does not affect the bottom-line liability that \ncompanies face.  The common practice\u2014adopted by \ntreatises, the Federal Judicial Center, and a number \nof courts\u2014is for a company to pay a lump sum, and if \nthere is anything left over (either because those funds \nwent unclaimed, or because claimants lacked a \ncompensable injury), that money goes somewhere \nbesides the company (such as a cy pres award, or a pro \nrata distribution).  See, e.g., Newberg and Rubenstein \non Class Actions, supra, at \u00a7 13:7 (\u201cIf the class does \nnot claim the full [settlement], the unclaimed funds do \nnot necessarily go back (or \u2018revert\u2019) to the defendant.\u201d); \nBarbara J. Rothstein & Thomas E. Willging, Federal \nJudicial Center, Managing Class Action Litigation: A \nPocket Guide for Judges 20 (3d ed. 2010) (\u201cA reversion \nclause creates perverse incentives for a defendant\u201d); \nsee also Marek v. Lane, 571 U.S. 1003, 1006 (2013) \n(Roberts, C.J., respecting the denial of certiorari) \n(noting \u201c[c]y pres remedies\u201d are a \u201cgrowing feature of \nclass action settlements,\u201d and questioning \u201cwhen, if \never, such relief should be considered\u201d). \nThe upshot is that if a plaintiff is able to augment a \nputative class with uninjured members, the benefits \nof that maneuver will vest upon certification\u2014it will \nturbo-charge the plaintiff\u2019s ability to force a \nsettlement and drive up that settlement\u2019s price.  \nWhether that tack is available to plaintiffs under \nfederal law is a question of tremendous import.  And \nit is one where this Court\u2019s review is urgently needed. \n\n \n30 \n \n \nIV. THIS PETITION IS A GOOD VEHICLE TO \nRESOLVE THIS ISSUE. \nThis petition presents an opportunity for this Court \nto finally answer the question it reserved in Tyson \nFoods\u2014and that has plagued the circuit courts since.  \nIt is a good vehicle to do so for three principal reasons. \nFirst, this case cleanly frames the legal issue \nbecause it involves both aspects of the split\u2014the class \nincludes individuals without Article III standing, and \nthe size of that group is far from de minimis. \nBoth of the classes here are defined around people \nwho have merely been \u201cexposed\u201d to an allegedly non-\nADA-compliant kiosk\u2014i.e., legally blind people who \nwalked into a Labcorp PSC that happened to include \na kiosk.  Supra at 8-9.  As the plaintiffs themselves \nacknowledged, that class definition is not limited to \nthose who have suffered an Article III injury.  Id. at 9. \nNor is this disputable.  Simply being proximate to a \nkiosk one is unable to use\u2014without any knowledge of \nit, let alone a desire to use it\u2014is not a \u201cconcrete\u201d harm.  \nTransUnion, 594 U.S. at 417.  Someone who learned \nabout the kiosks through this lawsuit has not been \ninjured by them.  Id. at 433-34, 438.  So too someone \nwith zero intention to use one\u2014any more than a vegan \ncould challenge how a restaurant processes and \nprepares its meat.  Of course, when any individual \ngenuinely suffers discrimination, that is an Article III \ninjury.  But such a person must be \u201cpersonally\u201d \nsubject to the discriminatory treatment to incur an \ninjury-in-fact.  Allen v. Wright, 468 U.S. 737, 757 n.22 \n(1984).  And here, neither certified class is limited to \nthose who have incurred such a harm; nor did \n\n \n31 \n \n \nplaintiffs attempt to proffer common evidence to show \nthat all members suffered any such treatment. \nIndeed, there is every indication in the record that \nplaintiffs\u2019 \nproposed \nclasses \nare \npermeated \nby \nuninjured members\u2014and contain far more than a de \nminimis number of individuals lacking an Article III \ninjury.  Recall, plaintiffs estimated their classes at \nhundreds-of-thousands of people.  Supra at 10.  But at \nthe same time, the unrebutted record evidence \nrevealed that nearly a third of all Labcorp patients \nprefer to check in at the front desk or online, rather \nthan use a kiosk; and as for legally blind patients in \nparticular, that figure is almost certainly much \nhigher.  Id. at 9.  Again, when the ACB surveyed \naround 4,500 of its members about their experiences \nwith Labcorp\u2019s kiosks, only twelve offered a relevant \nresponse.  Id.  And as the individual record evidence \nconfirmed, that is not surprising: Many legally blind \npatients neither know about nor intend to use \nLabcorp\u2019s kiosks over other options.  Id. \nBy the same lights, along with cleanly framing the \nlegal issue, this case also cleanly frames the practical \nstakes.  This suit typifies what plaintiffs are able to \naccomplish in circuits that do not police certification \non the front end: pack an open-ended class with an \nindeterminate number of uninjured members.  And \nthen, plaintiffs can pair that swelled class with \nstatutory damages to create the specter of business-\ncrushing liability.  Which is exactly what is happening \nhere, as the plaintiffs have combined California\u2019s \nUnruh Act with an inflated class to ask for half-a-\nbillion dollars per year in damages, thus assembling a \nmulti-billion dollar claim.  Whether that is allowed \nunderscores the real-world import of this issue. \n\n \n32 \n \n \nSecond, this petition arises out of the Ninth Circuit, \nwhose approach is most clearly in conflict with other \ncourts of appeals.  The Ninth Circuit has not only \nrejected the Article III position, but has also expressly \nrejected the de minimis rule by name.  Olean, 31 F.4th \nat 669 (rejecting the proposition Rule 23 bars \ncertification of \u201cclass that potentially includes more \nthan a de minimis number of uninjured class \nmembers\u201d); see also id. at 691-92 (Lee, J., dissenting) \n(flagging split).  And the panel applied Olean to certify \nthe damages subclass here.  Pet.App.5a & n.1. \nReviewing a case from the Ninth Circuit is \ntherefore perhaps the most straightforward way to \naddress the legal dispute that this Court must one day \nresolve\u2014namely, whether a federal court may certify \na class that contains members lacking any Article III \ninjury.  The Ninth Circuit has rejected both views \nfrom the circuits that hold no.  And it has done so \ndirectly, giving this Court a single position to review. \nIn addition, even absent a split, the Ninth Circuit\u2019s \nprecedent would warrant review, given the national \nrepercussions of its hyper-permissive approach to \nclass certification.  The Ninth Circuit is the country\u2019s \nlargest judicial circuit.  And it is home to California\u2014\nwhich has become a \u201chotbed\u201d for class actions, given \nthe state\u2019s no-actual-injury statutory damages laws \n(like the Unruh Act), coupled with the Ninth Circuit\u2019s \nwillingness to certify classes swelled by thousands of \nuninjured persons.  See Seyfarth, supra.  Whether the \nNinth Circuit has class action law right is alone a \nmulti-billion-dollar question\u2014itself worthy of review.  \nThird, this case arises out of a grant of a Rule 23(f) \ninterlocutory appeal, and thus allows the Court to \n\n \n33 \n \n \ncleanly review a standalone class certification \ndecision.  The federal appellate courts deny the vast \nmajority of Rule 23(f) petitions.  See Bryan Lammon, \nAn Empirical Study of Class-Action Appeals, 22 J. \nApp. Prac. & Process 283, 303 (2022).  As a result, \nquestions about class certification often come to this \nCourt in a post-verdict posture, burdened by a host of \nother (outcome-determinative) issues.  Cf. Tyson \nFoods, 577 U.S. at 465-66 (Roberts, C.J., concurring) \n(discussing whether practical problems alone might \nmerit decertification).  But here, the sole issue on \nreview is the Ninth Circuit\u2019s decision to affirm class \ncertification.  This Court should take advantage of \nthis clean opportunity to review the legal judgments \nthat gave rise to that decision\u2014just as it has done in \nother class-certification cases arising on a similar \ninterlocutory posture.  See Comcast, 569 U.S. at 32. \nNor should it matter the decision below is \nunpublished.  If anything, it counsels further in favor \nof this Court\u2019s immediate review.  The fact the Ninth \nCircuit could affirm this multi-billion-dollar class in a \nmemorandum opinion only underscores just how well-\nsettled the law is in that circuit.  And in turn, it only \nunderscores how desperately this Court\u2019s review is \nneeded, lest the Ninth\u2019s rubber stamp keep printing.8 \n \n \n \n8 This Court is no stranger to granting cert with unpublished \ndecisions, controlled by binding circuit precedent.  E.g., Lora v. \nUnited States, 599 U.S. 453 (2023); New York State Rifle & Pistol \nAss\u2019n v. Bruen, 597 U.S. 1 (2022); Stokeling v.

Davis*, concerns whether a class action can be certified under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(3) if some members of the proposed class have not suffered an Article III injury. The Ninth Circuit affirmed the class certification, and LabCorp is the petitioner appealing this decision. My uncertainty about the specific legal arguments, precedents, and judicial leanings remains high. The latest observation, which is an internal reasoning step, does not introduce new factual evidence about the case itself. However, it confirms that the central conflict revolves around the interpretation of Rule 23 in light of the constitutional standing requirements of Article III. My knowledge about the specific facts of the case remains stable, but my focus is now sharpened on the need to uncover the petitioner's and respondent's core legal arguments and the key precedents they will cite.",
          "design_beliefs": "I began with no knowledge of effective strategies for predicting Supreme Court outcomes. This observation provides my first foundational heuristic for information gathering. A structured and effective approach appears to be:\n1.  **Prioritize Primary Sources:** Begin by analyzing the core legal documents of the case itself. The \"Petition for a Writ of Certiorari\" is identified as the highest-value initial source for understanding the petitioner's arguments, the legal framework they are constructing, and the precedents they believe are controlling. This will be followed by the \"Brief in Opposition\" to understand the respondent's counter-arguments. This strategy focuses on building a strong task-specific (\u03b8) foundation first.\n2.  **Sequence Information Gathering:** The proposed plan suggests a specific sequence: first, understand the narrow arguments of the case (\u03b8-focused), and then use that knowledge to explore the broader legal context (D-focused). This implies that understanding the general jurisprudential debates (e.g., textualism vs. purposivism on Rule 23) is most effective *after* knowing which specific precedents and statutes are at issue in the case.\n3.  **Map Actions to Beliefs:** A key meta-strategy is to consciously decide whether an information-gathering action is intended to update task-level beliefs (\u03b8) or design-level beliefs (D). For example, reading the petition is explicitly for \u03b8, while searching for scholarly analysis on the precedents found within the petition is for D. This deliberate mapping helps ensure a comprehensive reduction of uncertainty across both belief layers."

          "task_beliefs": "My understanding of *Labcorp v. Davis* has significantly deepened from a general summary to a detailed, petitioner-focused perspective. While my prior belief that the case centers on the conflict between Rule 23 and Article III standing remains stable, I now have a wealth of specific information derived directly from LabCorp's Petition for a Writ of Certiorari.\n\n*   **Petitioner's Arguments & Strategy:** I now know LabCorp's precise legal arguments. They contend that the Ninth Circuit's decision to affirm class certification is \"wrong twice over.\"\n    1.  **Rule 23(b)(3) Predominance:** They argue that a class containing a \"sizable number\" of uninjured members cannot be certified because the individual inquiries required to separate the \"harmed from the unharmed\" would overwhelm any common questions, thereby failing the predominance requirement of Rule 23(b)(3).\n    2.  **Article III Standing:** They make a more fundamental constitutional argument that Article III completely bars a federal court from certifying a class that includes *any* members who lack a concrete injury. Their framing is powerful: \"if a person would be unable to get through the front doors of a federal court independently, he cannot be smuggled in through the back via a class.\"\n*   **Key Precedents & Legal Framework:** The petition provides a roadmap of the legal battlefield. LabCorp is heavily relying on recent Supreme Court precedent, most notably ***TransUnion LLC v. Ramirez (2021)***, which held that every class member seeking damages must have Article III standing. They also cite other major class action cases like ***Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes (2011)*** and ***Comcast Corp. v. Behrend (2013)*** to argue for a rigorous analysis at the certification stage. This confirms my earlier hypothesis about the importance of these cases and sharpens my focus on how they will be interpreted.\n*   **Factual & Policy Framing:** LabCorp is framing this not just as a legal error but as a major policy problem. They highlight the potential for \"half a billion dollars a year\" in liability to argue that allowing such class actions enables plaintiffs to \"manufacture leverage with which to extort a settlement.\" They also introduce specific facts to minimize the alleged harm, noting that alternative check-in methods were available and that even a named plaintiff described his experience as \"respectful\" and \"helpful.\"\n*   **Case Significance Signal:** A crucial new piece of information is that LabCorp is represented by Noel J. Francisco of Jones Day, a former U.S. Solicitor General and an elite Supreme Court advocate. His involvement signals that the petitioner believes this case has a high chance of being granted certiorari and won on the merits. This substantially increases my assessment of the case's importance and the quality of the arguments that will be presented to the Court.\n*   **Uncertainty:** My uncertainty is now highly concentrated on the respondent's position. I have a very clear picture of the petitioner's case, but no information on how Davis et al. will counter the arguments regarding the circuit split, the application of *TransUnion*, or the predominance requirement of Rule 23.",
          "design_beliefs": "My methodology for predicting Supreme Court outcomes has evolved significantly with this observation, solidifying initial heuristics and adding new, more sophisticated ones.\n\n*   **Source Value Confirmation:** This observation powerfully validates my prior belief that analyzing primary legal documents is the most effective initial strategy. The **Petition for a Writ of Certiorari** has proven to be the single most valuable source for understanding the petitioner's complete case narrative, legal arguments, key precedents, and policy framing. My strategy of starting with the petition and then moving to the opposition brief is confirmed as a highly effective sequence.\n*   **New Heuristic - \"Deconstruct the Cert Petition\":** I have learned that a cert petition has a standard, powerful structure that can be systematically deconstructed to extract maximum information. An effective analysis should identify:\n    1.  **The Question Presented:** The petitioner's specific framing of the legal issue.\n    2.  **The Circuit Split Narrative:** The argument that lower courts are in disagreement, which is a primary reason for the Supreme Court to take a case. LabCorp's petition categorizes the split into \"Article III Circuits,\" \"De Minimis Circuits,\" and \"Back-End Circuits,\" providing a clear map of the legal landscape.\n    3.  **The Core Legal & Constitutional Arguments:** Separating the statutory (Rule 23) from the constitutional (Article III) claims.\n    4.  **The Policy/Stakes Argument:** The \"real-world\" implications (e.g., \"extorted settlements\") used to persuade the Court of the case's importance.\n    5.  **The Table of Authorities:** This is a treasure map pointing to the key precedents that will define the legal debate.\n*   **New Heuristic - \"Follow the Advocate\":** The identity of the lawyers is a strong signal. The presence of an elite Supreme Court advocate like Noel Francisco indicates the case is well-funded, considered highly important by the petitioner, and likely to feature high-quality legal reasoning. This is a valuable proxy for assessing the potential for a cert grant and the strength of one side's arguments.\n*   **Refined Information Gathering Plan:** My sequential plan is now more detailed and robust:\n    1.  Analyze the Petition for a Writ of Certiorari (Done).\n    2.  Analyze the Brief in Opposition to understand the respondent's counter-arguments.\n    3.  Review Amicus Curiae briefs to gauge which outside parties (e.g., Chamber of Commerce, ACLU) are invested and to uncover supplementary arguments.\n    4.  Conduct a targeted analysis of the key precedents identified in the party briefs (especially *TransUnion*), focusing on how each side interprets them.

In 2016, in an effort to reduce staff and costs, \nLabCorp introduced a new service, LabCorp Express, \nand required its staff to instruct patients to utilize it. \nWith LabCorp Express, patients use a self-service \nkiosk to perform tasks like checking in, updating \ncontact information, making or modifying appoint-\nment times, accessing patient data and billing inform-\nation, and setting up a callback so that they can wait \nfor their appointment outside, rather than in the \nwaiting room.  \nAlthough LabCorp\u2019s kiosk vendor had presented \nthe company with an accessible option for legally blind \npatients, LabCorp selected a kiosk that it knew was \ninaccessible to those patients. This corporate-level \ndecision deprived all of LabCorp\u2019s legally blind \npatients of the use and advantages of LabCorp \nExpress. Further, because LabCorp reduced its front \ndesk staff after introducing the inaccessible LabCorp \nExpress kiosks, legally blind patients face delays \nwhile waiting for assistance to check in or perform \nother administrative functions that sighted patients \ncan perform through LabCorp Express.  \nRespondents, two legally blind patients who \nvisited LabCorp for diagnostic testing and the \nAmerican Council of the Blind, sued LabCorp under \nthe Americans with Disabilities Act and California\u2019s \nUnruh Civil Rights Act. Their complaint alleges that \nLabCorp denied legally blind patients the many \nadvantages that LabCorp offers sighted patients \nthrough LabCorp Express. The district court certified \nboth a nationwide injunctive relief class and a \n\n \n2 \nCalifornia damages class, and the court of appeals \naffirmed. In this Court, LabCorp asks whether a \nfederal court may certify a class when some members \npurportedly lack Article III injury. The petition should \nbe denied. \nTo begin with, this case does not involve any \nuninjured class members. Rather, as both the district \ncourt and court of appeals found, the classes are \ndefined to include only individuals who were denied \nthe full and equal enjoyment of the LabCorp Express \nservice on account of their disability, because the self-\nservice kiosk is inaccessible to all of them. LabCorp\u2019s \nresponse\u2014that the company provides an adequate \nalternative to the inaccessible LabCorp Express \nservice\u2014is not a standing argument, but a claimed \ndefense on the merits.   \nMoreover, although the petition largely conflates \nthem, this case involves two certified classes: an \ninjunctive relief class certified under Federal Rule of \nCivil Procedure 23(b)(2) and a damages class certified \nunder Rule 23(b)(3). As to the injunctive relief class, \nLabCorp failed to raise below the question that it asks \nthis Court to consider. Because the question presented \ndoes not go to subject-matter jurisdiction, LabCorp \nhas waived the question as to this class. In addition, \nboth this Court and the courts of appeals agree that \ninjury to every class member is not a prerequisite to \nRule 23(b)(2) certification.  \nAs to the damages class, and putting aside the \nabsence of uninjured class members, LabCorp is \nwrong that the courts of appeals are in conflict on its \nquestion presented. The courts all consider the \npossibility of uninjured members as part of the \ncommonality and predominance inquiries under \n\n \n3 \nRule 23(b)(3). In arguing that some circuits take a \ndifferent approach, LabCorp relies on out-of-context \nquotations of single sentences, while ignoring more \nrecent rulings from those courts that make clear that \nLabCorp\u2019s contention is flatly wrong. \nThe courts of appeals\u2019 approach to considering the \neffect of uninjured members on certification under \nRule 23(b)(3) is correct. This Court\u2019s precedents \nestablish that, as long as one plaintiff can establish \nstanding at the outset of the suit, the possibility of \nuninjured class members who may be weeded out \nbefore remedies are granted does not defeat subject-\nmatter jurisdiction. And limiting Rule 23(b)(3) class \nactions to cases where the plaintiffs could prove at the \ncertification stage that all class members suffered \ncompensable injuries would flout Rule 23(b)(3)\u2019s \nrecognition that issues of individual proof may be \nresolved following certification as long as they do not \npredominate over common issues. \nThe petition should be denied. \nSTATEMENT \nFactual background  \nLabCorp operates patient service centers that offer \nlaboratory services such as blood and urine tests. In \n2016, LabCorp decided that it could reduce staffing \ncosts and increase profits by placing kiosks at its \ncenters to enable patients to independently perform \nvarious tasks, including checking themselves in for \nappointments. Reflecting the advantage to patients of \nusing the kiosk independently, LabCorp calls the \nkiosk-based service \u201cLabCorp Express.\u201d \nLabCorp considered two vendor proposals for the \nLabCorp Express kiosks: one for kiosks that were \n\n \n4 \naccessible to legally blind patients and one for kiosks \nthat were not. Before choosing, LabCorp conducted an \ninternal risk scenario that identified inaccessibility to \nblind patients as a barrier to implementation of the \nlatter option. Nonetheless, LabCorp made a corporate-\nlevel decision to deploy the inaccessible kiosk nation-\nwide. Specifically, LabCorp selected an iPad-based \nkiosk design but disabled a suite of built-in access-\nibility features and covered the built-in headphone \nport (crucial for audio output to legally blind users). \nNow, approximately 1,853 LabCorp centers\u2014280 in \nCalifornia\u2014have the inaccessible kiosks.  \nFor LabCorp to achieve its projected cost savings, \npatients had to use the LabCorp Express kiosks. \nLabCorp therefore instructed remaining staff to \nredirect patients who sought to check in at the front \ndesk back to the kiosks. For example, LabCorp staff \nredirected legally blind respondent Luke Davis to the \ninaccessible kiosk for check in on at least six visits.   \nBecause legally blind patients cannot access the \nLabCorp Express service kiosk, they must check in \nwith the assistance of an employee. In hundreds of \nLabCorp locations, however, the front desk is no \nlonger staffed. Instead, staff is limited to one or two \nphlebotomists who are not located in the patient \nwaiting area, but rather in a blood-draw room located \nbehind a secure door. While the phlebotomists are in \nthe blood-draw rooms, LabCorp\u2019s sighted patients can \ncheck in quickly and privately through LabCorp \nExpress and be placed in the service queue. But before \nlegally blind patients can be placed in the queue or \naccess any other features of LabCorp Express, they \nmust wait for a phlebotomist to enter the waiting room \nto call another patient, must get the phlebotomist\u2019s \nattention, and must ask to be checked in. The only \n\n \n5 \nother check-in option for a legally blind patient is to \nask for help using the kiosk from a sighted person\u2014\nusually a stranger\u2014and thereby divulge personal \nmedical information in a nonconfidential setting.1   \nBeyond check in, the LabCorp Express service \noffers many additional advantages to sighted patients, \nincluding (1) allowing patients to independently \nupdate their contact information; (2) granting \npatients full access to their patient data, which \nLabCorp considers important for patients to manage \ntheir own healthcare; (3) allowing patients to pay and \nmanage past invoices; (4) allowing patients to make \nand manage appointments without staff assistance; \nand (5) providing a \u201cWait Where You\u2019re Comfortable\u201d \noption that allows patients to wait outside, rather \nthan in the waiting room. Because the express check-\nin service is inaccessible to blind patients, none of \nthese privileges or advantages are available to them. \nImmediately after rolling out LabCorp Express, \nLabCorp began receiving complaints from blind \npatients that its self-check-in kiosks were inaccess-\nible. LabCorp received at least 190 complaints across \neach of its six nationwide divisions.  \nRespondents Luke Davis and Julian Vargas both \nvisited one of LabCorp\u2019s patient service centers but, \n\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013 \n1 LabCorp also offers its sighted patients the option of \nbooking appointments online through a website. Patients can \nmanage appointments made online through use of the LabCorp \nmobile app, which in turn allows those patients to check in at a \nLabCorp Express kiosk by scanning a QR code. Like the kiosks, \nneither the website nor the mobile app is accessible for legally \nblind customers. Most legally blind patients therefore cannot \nmake appointments in advance and instead present as \u201cwalk ins\u201d \nwho must check in through the inaccessible kiosk or wait for an \nemployee to appear before they can enter the queue to be seen. \n\n \n6 \ndue to their disability, could not access LabCorp \nExpress and had to wait for assistance before checking \nin. On some visits, after being redirected to check in \nat the inaccessible kiosk, Mr. Davis had to disclose \npersonal information out loud in the public waiting \nroom so that a family member or, on one occasion, a \nstranger could complete the check in.  \nRespondent American Council of the Blind (ACB) \nis a national membership organization of thousands of \nblind and visually impaired persons. Since at least \nDecember 2018, it has received complaints from \nmembers \nreporting \nthat \nLabCorp \nExpress \nis \ninaccessible. Members have reported that, because \nthey cannot use LabCorp Express independently, they \nmust wait to check in. Numerous ACB members have \narrived at a LabCorp patient service center to find \nthat no staff member was present at the front desk, \nforcing them to request assistance from strangers. \nProcedural background \n \nRespondents\u2019 \nclass-action \ncomplaint \nasserts \nseveral causes of action against LabCorp, including \nfor violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act \n(ADA) and California\u2019s Unruh Civil Rights Act, which \nincorporates the ADA. Respondents assert that they \nwere denied access to LabCorp\u2019s services on equal \nterms with individuals who lacked respondents\u2019 \ndisability, see 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12182(b)(1)(A)(ii), that they \nwere denied appropriate auxiliary aids and services \nnecessary to ensure effective communication, see \n28 C.F.R. \u00a7 36.303(c)(1), and that LabCorp failed to \nmake reasonable accommodations to policies, prac-\ntices, or procedures necessary to afford access, see 42 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 12182(b)(2)(A)(ii). See First Am. Compl., \nD. Ct. Dkt. 40 at \u00b6\u00b6 41\u201359. \n\n \n7 \n \nFollowing discovery, respondents moved for class \ncertification. The district court granted the motion, \ncertifying a nationwide injunctive relief class and a \nCalifornia statuory damages class. Pet. App. 2a; id. at \n46a\u201347a (June 13, 2022, certification order); see id. at \n35a\u201336a (listing numerous common issues that \npredominate over individual issues). On June 16, \n2022, respondents filed a motion to refine the class \ndefinitions, which the court granted. Id. at 63a. As \nrefined, the nationwide injunctive class is defined as: \n\u201cAll legally blind individuals who visited a LabCorp \npatient service center with a LabCorp Express Self-\nService kiosk in the United States during the \napplicable limitations period, and who, due to their \ndisability, were unable to use the LabCorp Express \nSelf-Service kiosk.\u201d Id. at 57a. The Unruh Act \ndamages class definition is the same but replaces \u201cthe \nUnited States\u201d with \u201cCalifornia.\u201d Id. \nWhile the motion to refine the definitions was \npending, LabCorp filed a Rule 23(f) petition seeking \ninterlocutory appellate review of the class-certifi-\ncation order. In September 2022, the court of appeals \ngranted the Rule 23(f) petition.  \nOn appeal, LabCorp raised a host of arguments, \nonly one of which LabCorp raises here. Specifically, in \nchallenging certification of the California damages \nclass, LabCorp argued that certification was improper \nbecause Mr. Vargas and other class members were not \ninjured and, therefore, lacked standing. To begin with, \nLabCorp misstated the relevant inquiry as whether \nclass \nmembers \nwere \n\u201cdeprived \nof \naccessing \nLab[C]orp\u2019s medical testing services,\u201d Appellant Br. \n27, rather than whether they were deprived of access \nto services on equal terms as individuals without legal \nblindness, whether they were denied appropriate \n\n \n8 \nauxiliary aids or services needed to ensure effective \ncommunication, and whether LabCorp failed to make \nreasonable accommodations to policies, practices, or \nprocedures necessary to afford access. Having \nmisstated the deprivation at issue, LabCorp argued \nthat Article III barred certification of the damages \nclass because the record did not show that \u201call class \nmembers\u201d suffered injury. Id. at 28. \nAs to the nationwide injunctive relief class, \nLabCorp did not question standing. Rather, as to that \nclass, the issue that LabCorp raised and argued was \n\u201c[w]hether the District Court manifestly erred in \ncertifying the \u2026 class pursuant to Rule 23(b)(2) when \nthere is no evidence that an injunction would provide \na remedy to even a meaningful portion of class \nmembers.\u201d Id. at 6. Consistent with that statement of \nthe issue, LabCorp, in a short section near the end of \nits brief, asserted in summary fashion that the class \ndid not satisfy typicality or adequacy of represent-\nation, id. at 46\u2014points it had raised as to the damages \nclass separately from its Article III argument. \nCompare id. at 25\u201329 (standing), with id. at 41\u201344 \n(adequacy and typicality). It then argued briefly that \nclass certification was improper because no single \nuniform injunction would remedy the injury to all \nclass members, given that not all vision-impaired \npeople prefer the same accommodations. Id. at 46\u201348. \nIn an unpublished, non-precedential opinion, the \nNinth Circuit affirmed the district court\u2019s certification \nof the two classes. \nWith respect to the California class, the court held \nthat the district court did not abuse its discretion in \ncertifying the class. As to Mr. Vargas, the court had no \ndifficulty finding concrete injury. The court explained: \n\n \n9 \n[H]e \u2026 intended to check in using the kiosk b\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

In 2016, in an effort to reduce staff and costs, \nLabCorp introduced a new service, LabCorp Express, \nand required its staff to instruct patients to utilize it. \nWith LabCorp Express, patients use a self-service \nkiosk to perform tasks like checking in, updating \ncontact information, making or modifying appoint-\nment times, accessing patient data and billing inform-\nation, and setting up a callback so that they can wait \nfor their appointment outside, rather than in the \nwaiting room.  \nAlthough LabCorp\u2019s kiosk vendor had presented \nthe company with an accessible option for legally blind \npatients, LabCorp selected a kiosk that it knew was \ninaccessible to those patients. This corporate-level \ndecision deprived all of LabCorp\u2019s legally blind \npatients of the use and advantages of LabCorp \nExpress. Further, because LabCorp reduced its front \ndesk staff after introducing the inaccessible LabCorp \nExpress kiosks, legally blind patients face delays \nwhile waiting for assistance to check in or perform \nother administrative functions that sighted patients \ncan perform through LabCorp Express.  \nRespondents, two legally blind patients who \nvisited LabCorp for diagnostic testing and the \nAmerican Council of the Blind, sued LabCorp under \nthe Americans with Disabilities Act and California\u2019s \nUnruh Civil Rights Act. Their complaint alleges that \nLabCorp denied legally blind patients the many \nadvantages that LabCorp offers sighted patients \nthrough LabCorp Express. The district court certified \nboth a nationwide injunctive relief class and a \n\n \n2 \nCalifornia damages class, and the court of appeals \naffirmed. In this Court, LabCorp asks whether a \nfederal court may certify a class when some members \npurportedly lack Article III injury. The petition should \nbe denied. \nTo begin with, this case does not involve any \nuninjured class members. Rather, as both the district \ncourt and court of appeals found, the classes are \ndefined to include only individuals who were denied \nthe full and equal enjoyment of the LabCorp Express \nservice on account of their disability, because the self-\nservice kiosk is inaccessible to all of them. LabCorp\u2019s \nresponse\u2014that the company provides an adequate \nalternative to the inaccessible LabCorp Express \nservice\u2014is not a standing argument, but a claimed \ndefense on the merits.   \nMoreover, although the petition largely conflates \nthem, this case involves two certified classes: an \ninjunctive relief class certified under Federal Rule of \nCivil Procedure 23(b)(2) and a damages class certified \nunder Rule 23(b)(3). As to the injunctive relief class, \nLabCorp failed to raise below the question that it asks \nthis Court to consider. Because the question presented \ndoes not go to subject-matter jurisdiction, LabCorp \nhas waived the question as to this class. In addition, \nboth this Court and the courts of appeals agree that \ninjury to every class member is not a prerequisite to \nRule 23(b)(2) certification.  \nAs to the damages class, and putting aside the \nabsence of uninjured class members, LabCorp is \nwrong that the courts of appeals are in conflict on its \nquestion presented. The courts all consider the \npossibility of uninjured members as part of the \ncommonality and predominance inquiries under \n\n \n3 \nRule 23(b)(3). In arguing that some circuits take a \ndifferent approach, LabCorp relies on out-of-context \nquotations of single sentences, while ignoring more \nrecent rulings from those courts that make clear that \nLabCorp\u2019s contention is flatly wrong. \nThe courts of appeals\u2019 approach to considering the \neffect of uninjured members on certification under \nRule 23(b)(3) is correct. This Court\u2019s precedents \nestablish that, as long as one plaintiff can establish \nstanding at the outset of the suit, the possibility of \nuninjured class members who may be weeded out \nbefore remedies are granted does not defeat subject-\nmatter jurisdiction. And limiting Rule 23(b)(3) class \nactions to cases where the plaintiffs could prove at the \ncertification stage that all class members suffered \ncompensable injuries would flout Rule 23(b)(3)\u2019s \nrecognition that issues of individual proof may be \nresolved following certification as long as they do not \npredominate over common issues. \nThe petition should be denied. \nSTATEMENT \nFactual background  \nLabCorp operates patient service centers that offer \nlaboratory services such as blood and urine tests. In \n2016, LabCorp decided that it could reduce staffing \ncosts and increase profits by placing kiosks at its \ncenters to enable patients to independently perform \nvarious tasks, including checking themselves in for \nappointments. Reflecting the advantage to patients of \nusing the kiosk independently, LabCorp calls the \nkiosk-based service \u201cLabCorp Express.\u201d \nLabCorp considered two vendor proposals for the \nLabCorp Express kiosks: one for kiosks that were \n\n \n4 \naccessible to legally blind patients and one for kiosks \nthat were not. Before choosing, LabCorp conducted an \ninternal risk scenario that identified inaccessibility to \nblind patients as a barrier to implementation of the \nlatter option. Nonetheless, LabCorp made a corporate-\nlevel decision to deploy the inaccessible kiosk nation-\nwide. Specifically, LabCorp selected an iPad-based \nkiosk design but disabled a suite of built-in access-\nibility features and covered the built-in headphone \nport (crucial for audio output to legally blind users). \nNow, approximately 1,853 LabCorp centers\u2014280 in \nCalifornia\u2014have the inaccessible kiosks.  \nFor LabCorp to achieve its projected cost savings, \npatients had to use the LabCorp Express kiosks. \nLabCorp therefore instructed remaining staff to \nredirect patients who sought to check in at the front \ndesk back to the kiosks. For example, LabCorp staff \nredirected legally blind respondent Luke Davis to the \ninaccessible kiosk for check in on at least six visits.   \nBecause legally blind patients cannot access the \nLabCorp Express service kiosk, they must check in \nwith the assistance of an employee. In hundreds of \nLabCorp locations, however, the front desk is no \nlonger staffed. Instead, staff is limited to one or two \nphlebotomists who are not located in the patient \nwaiting area, but rather in a blood-draw room located \nbehind a secure door. While the phlebotomists are in \nthe blood-draw rooms, LabCorp\u2019s sighted patients can \ncheck in quickly and privately through LabCorp \nExpress and be placed in the service queue. But before \nlegally blind patients can be placed in the queue or \naccess any other features of LabCorp Express, they \nmust wait for a phlebotomist to enter the waiting room \nto call another patient, must get the phlebotomist\u2019s \nattention, and must ask to be checked in. The only \n\n \n5 \nother check-in option for a legally blind patient is to \nask for help using the kiosk from a sighted person\u2014\nusually a stranger\u2014and thereby divulge personal \nmedical information in a nonconfidential setting.1   \nBeyond check in, the LabCorp Express service \noffers many additional advantages to sighted patients, \nincluding (1) allowing patients to independently \nupdate their contact information; (2) granting \npatients full access to their patient data, which \nLabCorp considers important for patients to manage \ntheir own healthcare; (3) allowing patients to pay and \nmanage past invoices; (4) allowing patients to make \nand manage appointments without staff assistance; \nand (5) providing a \u201cWait Where You\u2019re Comfortable\u201d \noption that allows patients to wait outside, rather \nthan in the waiting room. Because the express check-\nin service is inaccessible to blind patients, none of \nthese privileges or advantages are available to them. \nImmediately after rolling out LabCorp Express, \nLabCorp began receiving complaints from blind \npatients that its self-check-in kiosks were inaccess-\nible. LabCorp received at least 190 complaints across \neach of its six nationwide divisions.  \nRespondents Luke Davis and Julian Vargas both \nvisited one of LabCorp\u2019s patient service centers but, \n\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013 \n1 LabCorp also offers its sighted patients the option of \nbooking appointments online through a website. Patients can \nmanage appointments made online through use of the LabCorp \nmobile app, which in turn allows those patients to check in at a \nLabCorp Express kiosk by scanning a QR code. Like the kiosks, \nneither the website nor the mobile app is accessible for legally \nblind customers. Most legally blind patients therefore cannot \nmake appointments in advance and instead present as \u201cwalk ins\u201d \nwho must check in through the inaccessible kiosk or wait for an \nemployee to appear before they can enter the queue to be seen. \n\n \n6 \ndue to their disability, could not access LabCorp \nExpress and had to wait for assistance before checking \nin. On some visits, after being redirected to check in \nat the inaccessible kiosk, Mr. Davis had to disclose \npersonal information out loud in the public waiting \nroom so that a family member or, on one occasion, a \nstranger could complete the check in.  \nRespondent American Council of the Blind (ACB) \nis a national membership organization of thousands of \nblind and visually impaired persons. Since at least \nDecember 2018, it has received complaints from \nmembers \nreporting \nthat \nLabCorp \nExpress \nis \ninaccessible. Members have reported that, because \nthey cannot use LabCorp Express independently, they \nmust wait to check in. Numerous ACB members have \narrived at a LabCorp patient service center to find \nthat no staff member was present at the front desk, \nforcing them to request assistance from strangers. \nProcedural background \n \nRespondents\u2019 \nclass-action \ncomplaint \nasserts \nseveral causes of action against LabCorp, including \nfor violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act \n(ADA) and California\u2019s Unruh Civil Rights Act, which \nincorporates the ADA. Respondents assert that they \nwere denied access to LabCorp\u2019s services on equal \nterms with individuals who lacked respondents\u2019 \ndisability, see 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12182(b)(1)(A)(ii), that they \nwere denied appropriate auxiliary aids and services \nnecessary to ensure effective communication, see \n28 C.F.R. \u00a7 36.303(c)(1), and that LabCorp failed to \nmake reasonable accommodations to policies, prac-\ntices, or procedures necessary to afford access, see 42 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 12182(b)(2)(A)(ii). See First Am. Compl., \nD. Ct. Dkt. 40 at \u00b6\u00b6 41\u201359. \n\n \n7 \n \nFollowing discovery, respondents moved for class \ncertification. The district court granted the motion, \ncertifying a nationwide injunctive relief class and a \nCalifornia statuory damages class. Pet. App. 2a; id. at \n46a\u201347a (June 13, 2022, certification order); see id. at \n35a\u201336a (listing numerous common issues that \npredominate over individual issues). On June 16, \n2022, respondents filed a motion to refine the class \ndefinitions, which the court granted. Id. at 63a. As \nrefined, the nationwide injunctive class is defined as: \n\u201cAll legally blind individuals who visited a LabCorp \npatient service center with a LabCorp Express Self-\nService kiosk in the United States during the \napplicable limitations period, and who, due to their \ndisability, were unable to use the LabCorp Express \nSelf-Service kiosk.\u201d Id. at 57a. The Unruh Act \ndamages class definition is the same but replaces \u201cthe \nUnited States\u201d with \u201cCalifornia.\u201d Id. \nWhile the motion to refine the definitions was \npending, LabCorp filed a Rule 23(f) petition seeking \ninterlocutory appellate review of the class-certifi-\ncation order. In September 2022, the court of appeals \ngranted the Rule 23(f) petition.  \nOn appeal, LabCorp raised a host of arguments, \nonly one of which LabCorp raises here. Specifically, in \nchallenging certification of the California damages \nclass, LabCorp argued that certification was improper \nbecause Mr. Vargas and other class members were not \ninjured and, therefore, lacked standing. To begin with, \nLabCorp misstated the relevant inquiry as whether \nclass \nmembers \nwere \n\u201cdeprived \nof \naccessing \nLab[C]orp\u2019s medical testing services,\u201d Appellant Br. \n27, rather than whether they were deprived of access \nto services on equal terms as individuals without legal \nblindness, whether they were denied appropriate \n\n \n8 \nauxiliary aids or services needed to ensure effective \ncommunication, and whether LabCorp failed to make \nreasonable accommodations to policies, practices, or \nprocedures necessary to afford access. Having \nmisstated the deprivation at issue, LabCorp argued \nthat Article III barred certification of the damages \nclass because the record did not show that \u201call class \nmembers\u201d suffered injury. Id. at 28. \nAs to the nationwide injunctive relief class, \nLabCorp did not question standing. Rather, as to that \nclass, the issue that LabCorp raised and argued was \n\u201c[w]hether the District Court manifestly erred in \ncertifying the \u2026 class pursuant to Rule 23(b)(2) when \nthere is no evidence that an injunction would provide \na remedy to even a meaningful portion of class \nmembers.\u201d Id. at 6. Consistent with that statement of \nthe issue, LabCorp, in a short section near the end of \nits brief, asserted in summary fashion that the class \ndid not satisfy typicality or adequacy of represent-\nation, id. at 46\u2014points it had raised as to the damages \nclass separately from its Article III argument. \nCompare id. at 25\u201329 (standing), with id. at 41\u201344 \n(adequacy and typicality). It then argued briefly that \nclass certification was improper because no single \nuniform injunction would remedy the injury to all \nclass members, given that not all vision-impaired \npeople prefer the same accommodations. Id. at 46\u201348. \nIn an unpublished, non-precedential opinion, the \nNinth Circuit affirmed the district court\u2019s certification \nof the two classes. \nWith respect to the California class, the court held \nthat the district court did not abuse its discretion in \ncertifying the class. As to Mr. Vargas, the court had no \ndifficulty finding concrete injury. The court explained: \n\n \n9 \n[H]e \u2026 intended to check in using the kiosk but \nwas unable to do so because the kiosk was not \naccessible to the blind. Instead, Vargas was \nforced to wait until he was noticed by a staff \nmember who aided him with check-in. As a \nresult of the inaccessibility of the kiosk, Vargas \nwas unable to immediately preserve his place \nin the patient queue, as sighted patients could, \nor to access any other kiosk features, such as \nthe \nability \nto \nprivately \nalter \naccount \ninformation. Thus, Vargas was denied effective \ncommunication and, by extension, the full and \nequal enjoyment of LabCorp\u2019s services. \nPet. App. 3a\u20134a.  \nTurning to commonality, the court noted that \u201cthe \nrelevant inquiry\u201d was \u201cwhether class members were \nsubject to the same injuring behavior.\u201d Id. at 5a. Here, \nit concluded, commonality was satisfied because \u201call \nclass members maintain that their injury resulted \nfrom the inaccessibility of a LabCorp kiosk.\u201d Id. And \nas to \u201cLabCorp\u2019s allegation that some potential class \nmembers may not have been injured,\u201d the court cited  \nOlean Wholesale Grocery Cooperative, Inc. v. Bumble \nBee Foods LLC, 31 F.4th 651, 668\u201369 (9th Cir. 2022), \ncert. denied, 143 S. Ct. 424 (2022), and held that the \nallegation \u201cdoes not defeat commonality at this time\u201d \nin any event. Pet. App. 5a n.1. \nWith respect to the nationwide class, reflecting \nthat LabCorp did not suggest an Article III problem, \nthe appellate opinion does not address that issue. \nInstead, addressing the argument that LabCorp did \nmake, the court explained: \nLabCorp argues that no single injunction could \nprovide relief to all class members, because not \n\n \n10 \nall blind people prefer the same accommoda-\ntions. But the class members in this action were \nnot injured by LabCorp\u2019s failure to meet their \npreferences; instead, all class members were \ninjured by the complete inaccessibility of \nLabCorp kiosks for blind individuals. As the \ndistrict court reasoned, by adding technological \naccommodations, the kiosks could be rendered \naccessible to the blind, thus addressing the \ninjuries of the entire class. Although some class \nmembers may still prefer not to use the kiosks, \nproviding them the ability to make that choice \nin the first place relieves any current injury. \nThe district court did not abuse its discretion in \nreaching the same conclusion. \nId. at 7a (emphasis added). \n \nLabCorp petitioned for rehearing en banc. As to \nstanding, it did not argue the issue that it asks this \nCourt to consider: whether a class can be certified \nwhen some class members experienced no injury. \nPet. i. Instead, it argued that making the LabCorp \nExpress service available to sighted people, but not to \nblind people, caused no injury. Reh\u2019g Pet. 7\u201310. It also \nasked the court to hold that the federal-service-mark-\nprotected \u201cLabCorp Express\u201d was not a \u201cservice,\u201d so \nthat providing that option only to sighted people, but \nnot to blind people, did not violate the ADA or the \nUnruh Act. Id. at 11\u201312. \nAs to the injunctive relief class, the rehearing \npetition mentioned standing only in a footnote, \nasserting that the panel did not address the standing \nof class representatives Mr. Davis or ACB because \nthey had \u201cfailed to show\u201d that they had standing. Id. \nat 3 n.1. In fact, LabCorp\u2019s panel briefing had not \n\n \n11 \nargued that those respondents lacked standing, res-\npondents\u2019 brief had described their injuries, see \nAppellee Br. 12\u201314, 15\u201317, and the panel had stated \nthat \u201call class members were injured.\u201d Pet. App. 7a.  \nLabCorp\u2019s rehearing petition was denied, with no \njudge calling for a vote. Id. at 10\u201311a. \nFully briefed cross-motions for summary judgment \nare now pending in the district court. See D. Ct. Dkt. \n144, 147. Argument on the motions is scheduled for \nJanuary. \nREASONS FOR DENYING THE WRIT \nI. The court of appeals did not affirm certifica-\ntion of classes including uninjured members.  \nThe court below did not uphold class certification \non the premise that a class can contain uninjured \nmembers. Rather, it concluded that every member of \nthe certified classes maintained that they had \nexperienced a common injury and that \u201call class \nmembers were injured by the complete inaccessibility \nof LabCorp kiosks for blind individuals.\u201d Pet. App. 7a. \nThus, the question stated in LabCorp\u2019s petition is not \npresented by the decision below. Only if the Court \nwere to hold that the court of appeals was wrong in \nholding that LabCorp\u2019s alleged wrongdoing, if proven, \ninjured all class members would LabCorp\u2019s question \narise in this case. But reviewing a court of appeals\u2019 \nresolution, in an unpublished opinion, of such a fact-\nbound determination is not an appropriate use of this \nCourt\u2019s discretionary jurisdiction. Moreover, the court \nof appeals was correct to recognize that all class \nmembers were subjected to unfavorable treatment by \nLabCorp on account of their disability. \n\n \n12 \nA. Title III of the ADA prohibits discrimination on \nthe basis of disability \u201cin the full and equal enjoyment \nof the goods, services, facilities, privileges, advan-\ntages, or accommodations of any place of public \naccommodation.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12182(a). The Unruh Act \nsimilarly provides that people with disabilities or \nmedical conditions, including blindness, are \u201centitled \nto full and equal access, as other members of the \ngeneral public, to accommodations, advantages, facil-\nities, [and] medical facilities, including hospitals, \nclinics, and physicians\u2019 offices.\u201d Cal. Civ. Code \n\u00a7 54.1(a)(1).  \nEvery member of the certified classes has been \ninjured by the violation of these provisions. The \nLabCorp Express service is an accommodation, \nadvantage, facility, privilege, or service that is \ninaccessible to blind patients. See First Am. Compl., \nD. Ct. Dkt. 40 at \u00b6 63. This inaccessibility denies blind \npatients full and equal access to the accommodations, \nadvantages, facilities, privileges, and services that \nLabCorp makes available to sighted patients, in \nviolation of the ADA and state law. Each class \nincludes only legally blind individuals who visited a \nLabCorp center with a LabCorp Express self-service \nkiosk and who, due to their disability, were unable to \naccess the kiosk\u2019s services. Pet. App. 57a.2  \n\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013 \n2 LabCorp\u2019s assertion that some class members \u201cdid not even \nknow there was a kiosk available,\u201d Pet. 9, only underscores that \nlegally blind patients\u2014unlike sighted patients\u2014lacked equal \naccess to the LabCorp Express service and its many advantages. \nIn addition, LabCorp asserts that some patients, sighted and \nunsighted, may prefer to check in with a receptionist. Id. at 9, 31. \nIt does not deny, however, that sighted patients\u2014but not blind \npatients\u2014have the option of accessing LabCorp Express for self-\n(Footnote continued) \n\n \n13 \nB. LabCorp\u2019s contention that some class members \nare uninjured because they received the desired \nmedical service, see Pet. 7, misunderstands the nature \nof the discriminatory conduct. Respondents do not \nassert that they were unable to have their blood \ndrawn. Rather, as explained above, supra p. 6, they \nassert that they were denied access to LabCorp\u2019s \nservices on full and equal terms, that they were denied \nappropriate auxiliary aids and services necessary to \nensure effective communication, and that LabCorp \nfailed to make reasonable accommodations to policies, \npractices, or procedures necessary to afford access\u2014\nincluding to LabCorp Express. See also Acheson \nHotels, LLC v. Laufer, 601 U.S. 1, 10 (2023) (Thomas, \nJ., concurring in the judgment) (explaining that a \nplaintiff who alleges a violation of her rights under the \nADA has standing); 303 Creative LLC v. Elenis, 600 \nU.S. 570, 590 (2023) (\u201c[P]ublic accommodations laws \n\u2018vindicate the deprivation of personal dignity that \nsurely accompanies denials of equal access to public \nestablishments.\u2019\u201d (quoting Heart of Atlanta Motel, Inc. \nv. United States, 379 U.S. 241, 250 (1964))); Sessions \nv. Morales-Santana, 582 U.S. 47, 73 (2017) (recog-\nnizing harm of adverse differential treatment). \nPutting aside LabCorp\u2019s misstatement of respond-\nents\u2019 claims, LabCorp\u2019s proffered defense\u2014that the \nability to check in at the front desk is an effective \nalternative under the ADA and the Unruh Act, Pet. 2, \n7\u20138\u2014goes to the merits, not to standing. See Pet. App. \n55a (\u201cUltimately, [LabCorp\u2019s] argument reflects a \nmerits dispute about the scope of \u2026 liability, and is \n\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013 \nservice check-in, and that sighted patients\u2014but not blind \npatients\u2014may benefit from the many other advantages that \nLabCorp Express offers in addition to check-in. \n\n \n14 \nnot appropriate for resolution at the class certification \nstage of this proceeding.\u201d (citation omitted)). \nIn short, LabCorp\u2019s argument that some class \nmembers are uninjured misunderstands respondents\u2019 \nclaims and case law regarding injury.  \nII. The question presented does not warrant \nreview as to the nationwide injunctive relief \nclass. \nThe question presented does not warrant review as \nto the nationwide injunctive relief class for two \nadditional reasons: LabCorp waived the issue of \nuninjured class members below; and courts, including \nthis Court, agree that, as to certification of an \ninjunctive relief class under Rule 23(b)(2), the \nstanding inquiry focuses solely on the named plaintiff. \nA. LabCorp waived its question presented \nas to the injunctive relief class. \nLabCorp asks this Court to decide whether a class \nmay be certified \u201cwhen some of its members lack any \nArticle III injury.\u201d Pet. i. Importantly, although \nLabCorp invokes Article III, its question presented \ndoes not go to jurisdiction. And because the issue is \nnot jurisdictional, LabCorp was required to raise it \nbelow to preserve it for this Court\u2019s review. With \nrespect to the nationwide injunctive relief class, \nLabCorp did not do so.  \n1. Although LabCorp frames its question presented \nin terms of Article III standing, it does not dispute \nthat the district court properly exercised subject-\nmatter jurisdiction over the case if one of the named \nplaintiffs has standing. As this Court and the lower \ncourts agree, if a named plaintiff has Article III \nstanding, the district court has jurisdiction to hear a \n\n \n15 \ncase arising under federal law. See Frank v. Gaos, 586 \nU.S. 485, 493 (2019) (per curiam) (stating that \njurisdiction over a class action depends on whether \n\u201cany named plaintiff has alleged [injuries] that are \nsufficiently concrete and particularized to support \nstanding\u201d); DaimlerChrysler Corp. v. Cuno, 547 U.S. \n332, 352 (2006) (stating that if a single plaintiff \n\u201cdemonstrate[s] standing \u2026 for each form of relief \nsought,\u201d the court has jurisdiction to resolve the \nplaintiff\u2019s claims (citation omitted)). \nRather than a jurisdictional inquiry, then, the \nquestion whether each class member must have an \nArticle III injury is a Rule 23 inquiry. That is, the \nquestion does not go to whether the district court can \npreside over the case, but to whether a class can be \ncertified. See 1 Newberg and Rubenstein on Class \nActions \u00a7 2:1 (6th ed. 2024) (\u201cWhether a plaintiff with \nstanding will be permitted to present not only her own \nindividual claims but also those of a class is not \nproperly a question of standing doctrine but of class \naction law.\u201d); Lewis v. Casey, 518 U.S. 343, 395 (1996) \n(Souter, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).3 \nIndeed, that the petition\u2019s merits discussion begins \nwith the requirements of Rule 23, not Article III, see \nPet. 20\u201323, reflects that LabCorp\u2019s question presented \nis a Rule 23 issue, not a jurisdictional one.  \nThis Court\u2019s treatment of the issue illustrates the \npoint. Although this Court has used the word \n\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013 \n3 As the leading class-action treatise explains: \n[T]he standing inquiry should simply focus on the class \nrepresentative\u2019s \nindividual \nstanding \nwhile \nthe \nrepresentational inquiries should be made through the \nlens of Rule 23, not standing.  \n1 Newberg and Rubenstein on Class Actions \u00a7 2:1. \n\n \n16 \n\u201cstanding\u201d when discussing whether each member of \na class has experienced injury, it has more than once \ndeclined to address the question in class-action cases. \nSee TransUnion LLC v. Ramirez, 594 U.S. 413, 431 \nn.4 (2021); Tyson Foods, Inc. v. Bouaphakeo, 577 U.S. \n442, 460 (2016); Amchem Prods., Inc. v. Windsor, 521 \nU.S. 591, 612 (1997). If the matter were \u201cjuris-\ndictional,\u201d though, the Court could not have chosen to \nbypass the issue after identifying it. See Boechler, P.C. \nv. Comm\u2019r, 596 U.S. 199, 203 (2022) (\u201cJurisdictional \nrequirements cannot be waived or forfeited, must be \nraised by courts sua sponte, and \u2026 do not allow for \nequitable exceptions.\u201d); Frank, 586 U.S. at 492 (noting \na federal court\u2019s \u201cobligation to assure [itself] of \nlitigants\u2019 standing under Article III\u201d (citation \nomitted)). The Court could avoid the issue in each of \nthe cited cases because, notwithstanding use of the \nword \u201cstanding,\u201d the issue is not jurisdictional.4  \n2. LabCorp did not contest below that nationwide \nclass representative Mr. Davis has standing, and the \npetition likewise does not dispute his standing or \nACB\u2019s standing. Because these plaintiffs have \nstanding to pursue their claims, the district court has \nArticle III jurisdiction to adjudicate them. Cf. Town of \nChester v. Laroe Estates, Inc., 581 U.S. 433, 439 (2017) \n(\u201cAt least one plaintiff must have standing to seek \neach form of relief requested in the complaint.\u201d).  \n\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013 \n4 This context is not the only one in which \u201cstanding\u201d is used \nto connote a non-jurisdictional concern. See Lexmark Int\u2019l, Inc. v. \nStatic Control Components, Inc., 572 U.S. 118, 125\u201326, 128 n.4 \n(2014) (noting that the term \u201cprudential standing\u201d is not a matter \nof Article III jurisdiction and, likewise, that the term \u201cstatutory \nstanding\u201d is \u201cmisleading\u201d and \u201c\u2018does not implicate subject-matter \njurisdiction\u2019\u201d (quoting Verizon Md. Inc. v. Pub. Serv. Comm\u2019n of \nMd., 535 U.S. 635, 642\u201343 (2002))). \n\n \n17 \nBecause LabCorp\u2019s question presented is not \njurisdictional, LabCorp was required to raise the issue \nbelow to preserve it for review by this Court. See \nMoody v. NetChoice, LLC, 144 S. Ct. 2383, 2399 \n(2024); Cutter v. Wilkinson, 544 U.S. 709, 718 n.7 \n(2005) (declining to consider issues not addressed in \nthe court of appeals, \u201cmindful that we are a court of \nreview, not of first view\u201d). With respect to the nation-\nwide injunctive relief class, LabCorp failed to do so. \nAs explained above, supra pp. 7\u20138, LabCorp\u2019s \nappellate brief challenged the standing of named \nplaintiff Mr. Vargas, who is the statutory damages \nclass representative. It did not, however, challenge \nMr. Davis\u2019s standing or argue that all members of the \nnationwide class must have standing.5 Rather, as to \nthe injunctive relief class, the issue that it raised and \nargued did not concern uninjured class members, but \nthe feasibility of a class-wide remedy. Appellant Br. 6 \n(statement of the issue); id. at 23\u201324 (summary of \nargument). Likewise, although the panel had stated \nexpressly that all members of the injunctive class had \nstanding, Pet. App. 7a, LabCorp\u2019s petition for \nrehearing en banc did not seek review of that point. \n\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013 \n5 LabCorp\u2019s opposition to the class-certification motion and \nits opening brief on appeal were clear that its standing argu-\nments concerned only the damages class. Its reply brief on appeal \nmade some broad statements that, taken alone, could leave the \nargument\u2019s scope unclear. But the brief\u2019s focus on the damages \nclass representative, Mr. Vargas, makes clear that the standing \nargument there also concerned only the damages class. Issues \nnot raised in the opening brief on appeal are waived. See SNJ \nLtd. v. Comm\u2019r, 28 F.4th 936, 939 n.1 (9th Cir. 2022) (citing \nSmith v. Marsh, 194 F.3d 1045, 1052 (9th Cir. 1999)). \n\n \n18 \nIn sum, the petition\u2019s question presented is not \nproperly presented to this Court as to the injunctive \nrelief class. \nB. With respect to an injunctive relief \nclass, the question is well settled in this \nCourt and among the lower courts. \nLabCorp had good reason for its decision not to \nargue that every member of the injunctive relief class \nmust have standing: In cases seeking injunctive relief, \n\u201cit is well settled that \u2026 the standing inquiry focuses \nsolely on the named plaintiff or proposed class \nrepresentative.\u201d 1 Newberg and Rubenstein on Class \nActions \u00a7 2:3; see, e.g., Horne v. Flores, 557 U.S. 433, \n446 (2009) (\u201cBecause the superintendent clearly has \nstanding to challenge the lower courts\u2019 decisions [to \nenter declaratory judgment], we need not consider \nwhether the Legislators also have standing to do so.\u201d); \nRumsfeld v. Forum for Academic & Inst. Rights, Inc., \n547 U.S. 47, 52 n.2 (2006) (in a case seeking injunctive \nrelief, explaining that \u201cthe presence of one party with \nstanding is sufficient to satisfy Article III\u2019s case-or-\ncontroversy requirement,\u201d and stating that because \none of the plaintiffs had standing, the Court had no \nneed to address the others (citation omitted)); Vill. of \nArlington Heights v. Metro. Hous. Dev. Corp., 429 U.S. \n252, 263\u201364 & n.9 (1977) (stating that, where one \nnamed plaintiff has demonstrated standing to contest \na zoning decision, \u201cwe need not consider whether the \nother individual and corporate plaintiffs have \nstanding to maintain the suit\u201d); see also Biden v. \nNebraska, 143 S. Ct. 2355, 2365 (2023) (\u201cIf at least one \nplaintiff has standing, the suit may proceed.\u201d). \nUnsurprisingly given this Court\u2019s case law, the \ncourts of appeals likewise do not inquire into the \n\n \n19 \nstanding of each member in cases involving injunctive \nrelief classes certified under Rule 23(b)(2). See, e.g., \nMontoya v. Jeffreys, 99 F.4th 394, 399 (7th Cir. 2024); \nCarolina Youth Action Project v. Wilson, 60 F.4th 770, \n779 (4th Cir. 2023); Hyland v. Navient Corp., 48 F.4th \n110, 117\u201318 (2d Cir. 2022); Daves v. Dallas Cnty., 22 \nF.4th 522, 542 (5th Cir. 2022) (en banc); J.D. v. Azar, \n925 F.3d 1291, 1323\u201324 (D.C. Cir. 2019); McNair v. \nSynapse Grp. Inc., 672 F.3d 213, 223 (3d Cir. 2012); \nEllis v. Costco Wholesale Corp., 657 F.3d 970, 978\u201379 \n(9th Cir. 2011); DG ex rel. Stricklin v. Devaughn, 594 \nF.3d 1188, 1201 (10th Cir. 2010); Canadian Lumber \nTrade All. v. United States, 517 F.3d 1319, 1339 (Fed. \nCir. 2008); Prado-Steiman ex rel. Prado v. Bush, 221 \nF.3d 1266, 1279\u201380 (11th Cir. 2000). \nThe cases cited by LabCorp do not suggest \notherwise. All but two of the cited cases address the \nissue with respect to a Rule 23(b)(3) damages class, \nnot a Rule 23(b)(2) injunctive relief class. And the two \ncases cited by LabCorp that concern Rule 23(b)(2) \nclasses, Carolina Youth Action Project and DG ex rel. \nStricklin, see Pet. 18 n.5 & 19 n.6, are consistent with \nthe uniform rule: The possibility that a Rule 23(b)(2) \nclass includes members unharmed by the defendant\u2019s \nconduct does not preclude certification if the \n\u201cchallenged practices are based on grounds that apply \ngenerally to the class.\u201d DG ex rel. Strickland, 594 F.3d \nat 1201; see Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2) (providing for class \ncertification where a defendant \u201chas acted or refused \nto act on grounds that apply generally to the class\u201d). \nThe absence of a disagreement among the circuits, \ncoupled with LabCorp\u2019s failure to brief and argue the \nissue below, leave the question presented wholly \nunworthy of review as to the injunctive relief class. \n\n \n20 \nIII. The question presented does not warrant \nreview as to the Unruh Act damages class. \nA. The courts of appeals agree that the \npresence of uninjured class members is \na consideration under Rule 23(b)(3). \nEach of the courts of appeals take into consider-\nation the presence of uninjured class members when \nassessing the Rule 23(b)(3) requirements of common-\nality and predominance. Contrary to LabCorp\u2019s \nargument otherwise, no circuit bars class certification \nwhere not all class members have Article III standing. \nEven putting aside that the class in this case does not \ninclude uninjured members, Pet. App. 7a, and that \nLabCorp\u2019s argument to the contrary goes to the \nmerits, not to standing, id. at 55a, the absence of a \nconflict among the circuits provides an additional \nreason to deny the petition. \n1. LabCorp seeks to distinguish cases addressing \nthe requirements set forth in Rule 23(b)(3) that take a \n\u201cde minimis\u201d approach from those that take a \u201cback-\nend\u201d approach. The cited cases do not support the \ndistinction crafted by LabCorp, however, because no \ncircuit has adopted a de minimis rule. Rather, in each \ncase, based on the particular facts, each court \nconsidered whether Rule 23(b)(3)\u2019s predominance \nrequirement was satisfied, or whether the steps that \nwould be required to identify uninjured class members \ndefeated predominance. See Olean Wholesale Grocery, \n31 F.4th at 669 n.13 (explaining that neither the D.C. \nnor the First Circuit has adopted the de minimis rule \nthat LabCorp ascribes to them). \na. LabCorp relies heavily on the D.C. Circuit\u2019s \nopinions in In re Rail Freight Surcharge Antitrust \nLitigation, 725 F.3d 244 (D.C. Cir. 2013), and 934 F.3d \n\n \n21 \n619 (D.C. Cir. 2019). See Pet. 16\u201317. Neither mentions \nArticle III or standing. Those cases therefore cannot \nreasonably be deemed to stake out a position on the \nquestion presented.  \nRather, in that large antitrust case, the D.C. \nCircuit considered the presence of thousands of \nuninjured class members in the context of considering \nwhether Rule 23\u2019s predominance requirement was \nmet. See 725 F.3d at 252\u201353; 934 F.3d at 624. \nContrary to LabCorp\u2019s contention, the case did not \nadopt a rule that certification is categorically \nprohibited where a class includes more than a \u201cde \nminimis\u201d number of uninjured plaintiffs. Rather, the \ncourt assumed \u201c[f]or the sake of argument\u201d that \u201cthe \ndistrict court correctly recognized a de minimis \nexception to the general rule that, for claims under \nsection 4 of the Clayton Act, causation and injury \nmust be capable of classwide resolution.\u201d 934 F.3d at \n624 (internal quotation marks omitted). It neither \nadopted nor rejected that exception, however, instead \nfocusing on whether injury and damages could be \nresolved on a classwide basis. Holding that the district \ncourt had not abused its discretion in declining to find \npredominance, the court of appeals noted the large \nnumber of uninjured shippers in the proposed class \nand the \u201cabsence of any winnowing mechanism,\u201d other \nthan \u201cfull-blown, individual trials,\u201d to distinguish \ninjured from uninjured shippers. Id. at 625. \nLikewise, the First Circuit\u2019s decisions in In re \nNexium Antitrust Litigation, 777 F.3d 9 (1st Cir. \n2015), and In re Asacol Antitrust Litigation, 907 F.3d \n42 (1st Cir. 2018), do not state a de minimis rule. In \nIn re Nexium, in response to the defendants\u2019 argument \nthat \u201ceven a de minimis number\u201d of uninjured class \nmembers \u201cdefeats the 23(b)(3) predominance require-\n\n \n22 \nment,\u201d 777 F.3d at 18, the First Circuit held that \u201ca \ncertified class may include a de minimis number of \npotentially uninjured parties,\u201d id. at 25. Emphasizing \nthat it was addressing the defendants\u2019 argument\u2014\nand not adopting the rule that LabCorp ascribes to \nit\u2014the court added: \u201cWe need not decide whether it is \never permissible to define a proper class including \nmore than a de minimis number of uninjured parties \nsince we conclude that it has not been shown that the \nclass here includes more than a de minimis number of \nuninjured parties.\u201d Id. \nIn re Asacol likewise does not reflect \u201ca strict \napproach,\u201d Pet. 17, barring certification based on a de \nminimis rule. There, the First Circuit found that \u201cany \nclass member may be uninjured, and there are \napparently thousands who in fact suffered no injury.\u201d \n907 F.3d at 53. For that reason, the court concluded \nthat \u201c[t]he need to identify those individuals will \npredominate and render an adjudication unmanage-\nable.\u201d Id. at 53\u201354. Far from adopting a de minimis \nrule, it used the term \u201cde minimis\u201d only twice: once in \nquoting the district court\u2019s finding that only a de \nminimis number of class members were uninjured, \nand once in a parenthetical quote. Id. at 47, 54. \nFurther refuting LabCorp\u2019s description of First \nCircuit case law, Judge Barron\u2019s concurrence notes \nthat, \u201ceven where the number of uninjured class \nmembers is de minimis, plaintiffs\u2019 reliance on \nindividualized means of proving injury [may be] so \ngreat that it can no longer comport with the predom-\ninance requirement.\u201d Id. at 59. That is, the First \nCircuit has not held either that predominance is \nsatisfied where only a de minimis number of class \nmembers are uninjured or that predominance is not \nsatisfied in that circumstance. Rather, the court has \n\n \n23 \nfocused on whether, in light of the number of \nuninjured class members within the class definition, \ncommon issues do or do not predominate. \nLabCorp agrees that Third Circuit case law is \nconsistent with these cases. See Pet. 17 n.4 (citing \nNeale v. Volvo Cars of N. Am., LLC, 794 F.3d 353, 362, \n365 (3d Cir. 2015)); see also Huber v. Simon\u2019s Agency, \nInc., 84 F.4th 132, 155 (3d Cir. 2023) (\u201c[A]t certifica-\ntion, the standing of individual class members may \ninform whether a proposed class satisfies the require-\nments of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23, but it is \nnot necessary for each member to prove his or her \nstanding for the class action to be justiciable.\u201d \n(citations omitted)). \nb. The circuits that LabCorp places in its \u201cback-\nend\u201d category are no different. Contrary to LabCorp\u2019s \ncontention, those courts have not held that uninjured \nclass members pose a barrier to class certification \nunder Rule 23(b)(3) \u201conly if there is a really large \nnumber of uninjured members.\u201d Pet. 18. Rather, each \ndecision addresses whether the proposed class satis-\nfies Rule 23(b)(3)\u2019s requirements in light of the facts \nbefore it, including, in those cases where some \nmembers may not have been injured, the need for \nindividualized inquiry. \nLabCorp turns first to the Ninth Circuit. To \nsupport its view, LabCorp starts by citing as \u201c[s]ee \nalso\u201d a footnote in Ruiz Torres v. Mercer Canyons Inc., \n835 F.3d 1125 (9th Cir. 2016). Pet. 18. The footnote \ndiscusses a sentence in the Second Circuit decision in \nDenney v. Deutsche Bank AG, 443 F.3d 253 (2d Cir. \n2006), which a previous Ninth Circuit opinion had \nread to mean that a class containing members lacking \nArticle III standing cannot be certified. Ruiz Torres, \n\n \n24 \n835 F.3d at 1137 n.6. The footnote explains that the \nearlier Ninth Circuit panel read the sentence out of \ncontext but states no view on the Article III question, \nwhich was not before it. (The Second Circuit reads \nDenney the same way as the Ninth. See infra pp. 26\u2013\n27.) Ruiz Torres took no position on the question \npresented; indeed, it did not even involve uninjured \nclass members. See Ruiz Torres, 835 F.3d at 1137 \n(explaining that, in the case before it, \u201cthe existence of \na common policy or practice, if proven, is evidence that \nthe class as a whole\u201d experienced the wrongful conduct \n(emphasis added)). \nThe other Ninth Circuit case briefly cited by \nLabCorp, Olean Wholesale Grocery, 31 F.4th 651, \nlikewise does not support its view. As in Ruiz Torres, \nthe court found that all class members had standing \nand, therefore, that the issue was not before it. Id. at \n682 (\u201cWe need not consider the \u2026 argument that the \npossible presence of a large number of uninjured class \nmembers raises an Article III issue, because the \n[plaintiffs] have demonstrated that all class members \nhave standing here.\u201d); see id. (\u201c[T]he [plaintiffs] have \nadequately demonstrated Article III standing at the \nclass certification stage for all class members, whether \nor not that was required.\u201d). \nLabCorp is correct that Olean, in dicta, declined \nthe defendants\u2019 urging that it adopt a de minimis rule, \nstating that such a rule would be \u201cinconsistent with \nRule 23(b)(3), which requires only that the district \ncourt determine after rigorous analysis whether the \ncommon question predominates over any individual \nquestions, including individualized questions about \ninjury or entitlement to damages.\u201d Id. at 669. At the \nsame time, the court made clear that, \u201c[w]hen individ-\nualized questions relate to the injury status of class \n\n \n25 \nmembers, Rule 23(b)(3) requires that the court \ndetermine whether individualized inquiries about \nsuch matters would predominate over common \nquestions.\u201d Id. at 668. The opinion offers no support \nfor the assertion that the court has embraced the view \nthat certification is proper absent \u201ca really large \nnumber of uninjured members.\u201d Pet. 18. \n The Seventh Circuit cases cited by LabCorp are \nsimilar: They neither opine on Article III nor state a \nrule as to the number of uninjured class members that \nwould \ndefeat \npredominance. \nSee \nMessner \nv. \nNorthshore Univ. HealthSystem, 669 F.3d 802, 825\u201326 \n(7th Cir. 2012) (in an antitrust case where the \ndefendant argued that 2.4% of the class was \nuninjured, finding predominance of common ques-\ntions on liability and stating that whether the class \ndefinition contains too many uninjured members is \u201ca \nmatter of degree, and will turn on the facts as they \nappear from case to case\u201d); Kohen v. Pac. Inv. Mgmt. \nCo., 571 F.3d 672, 677\u201378 (7th Cir. 2009) (stating that \nthe defendant had argued \u201cstatutory standing,\u201d not \nArticle III standing, and agreeing that, \u201cif the class \ndefinition clearly were overbroad, this would be a \ncompelling reason to require that it be narrowed\u201d); see \nalso In re Dealer Mgmt. Sys. Antitrust Litig., 2024 WL \n3509668, at *15 (N.D. Ill. July 22, 2024). \nThe Eleventh Circuit also has not adopted the \nview, ascribed to it by LabCorp, that predominance is \nnot satisfied \u201conly where a \u2018large portion\u2019 of members \nlack injury.\u201d Pet. 19 (quoting Cordoba v. DIRECTTV, \nLLC, 942 F.3d 1259, 1277 (11th Cir. 2019)). Instead, \nin the case that LabCorp cites, the court mentioned \u201ca \nlarge portion\u201d of members in referring to its concern \nabout the facts of the case before it. As the court \nexplains, its \u201conly hold[ing]\u201d on the issue was that the \n\n \n26 \ndistrict court erred in failing to \u201csort out the uninjured \nclass members\u201d when it \u201cappear[ed] that a large \nportion of the class does not have standing, as it \nseem[ed] at first blush here, and making that \ndetermination for these members of the class will \nrequire individualized inquiries.\u201d Cordoba, 942 F.3d \nat 1276\u201377 (emphasis added).  \n2. Although a few appellate-court decisions have \ndescribed the matter in terms of Article III standing, \nthey have done so within the confines of applying Rule \n23. LabCorp asserts that those circuits deny class \ncertification \u201cwhere [the class] includes members who \nhave suffered no Article III injury.\u201d Pet. 14. In every \none of those circuits, however, the case law definitively \nrefutes that assertion. \na. LabCorp leads with the Second Circuit decision \nin Denney v. Deutsche Bank AG. LabCorp is correct \nthat Denney includes a sentence stating that \u201cno class \nmay be certified that contains members lacking \nArticle III standing.\u201d 443 F.3d at 264; see Pet. 14. The \nSecond Circuit, however, has expressly rejected \nLabCorp\u2019s reading of this sentence. As the Second \nCircuit has explained, the \u201csingle sentence\u201d in Denney \ndid not \u201csuggest[] that all class members must have \nstanding for the class to proceed.\u201d Hyland, 48 F.4th at \n118 n.1. Rather, in context, the sentence says only \nthat a class must be defined in terms of members who \nhave suffered injury. See id. at 117\u201318 (citing several \ncases for the proposition that only one named plaintiff \nneed have standing with respect to each claim); see \nRuiz Torres, 835 F.3d at 1137 n.6; Kohen, 571 F.3d at \n677 (describing Denney as \u201cfocus[ing] on the class \ndefinition; if the definition is so broad that it sweeps \nwithin it persons who could not have been injured by \nthe defendant\u2019s conduct, it is too broad\u201d).  \n\n \n27 \nOther post-Denney Second Circuit cases likewise \nbelie LabCorp\u2019s reading of Second Circuit case law. \nSee Cent. States Se. & Sw. Areas Health & Welfare \nFund v. Merck-Medco Managed Care, LLC, 504 F.3d \n229, 241, 245 (2d Cir. 2007) (noting \u201c[a]s a threshold \nmatter \u2026 that only one of the named Plaintiffs is \nrequired to establish standing in order to seek relief \non behalf of the entire class,\u201d and citing Denney for \nboilerplate proposition); cf. Liberian Cmty. Ass\u2019n of \nConn. v. Lamont, 970 F.3d 174, 185 n.14 (2d Cir. 2020) \n(\u201cBecause we conclude that none of the named \nplaintiffs has standing to pursue their claims for \nprospective relief, the class proposed by [them] \nnecessarily fails as well.\u201d). \nb. Similarly, LabCorp\u2019s discussion of Eighth \nCircuit law is both inaccurate and incomplete. Like \nthe other circuits, the Eighth Circuit does not require \nevidence of standing as to each class member before \ncertification\u2014as confirmed by recent Eighth Circuit \ndecisions that LabCorp fails to cite. See Vogt v. State \nFarm Life Ins. Co., 963 F.3d 753, 766\u201367 (8th Cir. \n2020) (rejecting the argument that all class members \nmust have standing to certify a Rule 23(b)(3) class, \nand citing 1 Steven Gensler & Lumen Mulligan, \nFederal Rules of Civil Procedures, Rules and \nCommentary, Rule 23 (2020) for the proposition that \n\u201c[i]f it turns out that some members of the class are \nnot entitled to relief, that represents a failure on the \nmerits, not the lack of a justiciable claim\u201d); Stuart v. \nState Farm Fire & Casualty Co., 910 F.3d 371, 377 \n(8th Cir. 2018) (stating that \u201c[a]lthough couched as \ndisputes about standing, State Farm\u2019s arguments \nreally go to the merits of plaintiffs\u2019 claims\u201d because \nwhether some plaintiffs are unable to prove damages \n\u201cis a merits question\u201d). \n\n \n28 \nArguing otherwise, LabCorp cites Avritt v. \nReliastar Life Insurance Co., 615 F.3d 1023 (8th Cir. \n2010), cited in Pet. 14\u201315. But Avritt agrees that proof \nof each class member\u2019s standing is not a prerequisite \nto certification. 615 F.3d at 1034. In the one sentence \non which LabCorp relies, the court was addressing the \nplaintiff\u2019s argument that individual issues of reliance \nand injury posed no obstacle to commonality and \npredominance because state law allowed the claim at \nissue to be brought on the state\u2019s behalf by an \nuninjured person. In responding to that argument, \nwhich suggested that uninjured people were proper \nplaintiffs in federal court, the court stated that \u201ca \nnamed plaintiff cannot represent a class of persons \nwho lack the ability to bring a suit themselves.\u201d Id., \nquoted in Pet. 14\u201315. The opinion is not fairly read to \nstate the position suggested by LabCorp.  \nLabCorp briefly cites two other Eighth Circuit \ncases, neither of which supports its description of \nCircuit law. The first, Halvorson v. Auto-Owners \nInsurance Co., 718 F.3d 773, 778 (8th Cir. 2013), finds \nthat the individualized inquiries needed to determine \nwho was injured and in what way defeated predom-\ninance. \nThe \nsecond, \nJohannessohn \nv. \nPolaris \nIndustries Inc., 9 F.4th 981, 988 & n.3 (8th Cir. 2021), \nexpressly disclaims the notion that proof of all \nmembers\u2019 standing is a prerequisite to certification.  \nc. LabCorp\u2019s brief assertion that the Sixth Circuit, \nin an unpublished opinion, \u201cendorsed\u201d a rule that a \nclass cannot be certified if any members might lack \nstanding, Pet. 15, is also off base. To begin with, that \nnon-precedential opinion, In re Carpenter Co., 2014 \nWL 12809636 (6th Cir. Sept. 29, 2014), suggests that \nthe issue had to be raised below to be preserved for \nappeal. Id. at *3 (\u201c[a]ssuming that the Petitioners \n\n \n29 \npreserved their standing argument\u201d). The opinion \nthus reflects that the Sixth Circuit was not endorsing \nthe view that the question derives from Article III. See \nsupra Part II.A.  \nFurthermore, a recent precedential decision from \nthe Sixth Circuit makes clear that the court is in line \nwith its sister circuits: In Speerly v. General Motors, \nLLC, 115 F.4th 680 (6th Cir. 2024), pet. for reh\u2019g \npending, the court considered the certification of a \nclass of purchasers of certain allegedly defective \nvehicles. Id. at 688. On appeal, the defendant argued \nthat the class should not have been certified because \nsome class members\u2019 vehicles had not manifested the \ndefect, and those members lacked injury. Rejecting \nthat argument, the court of appeals explained that \n\u201cwhether all class members must actually experience \nan alleged defect in order to establish Article III \ninjury-in-fact for a proposed class,\u201d the \u201cappropriate \ntime to address claims of absent class members whose \nvehicles never have manifested any defect is a Rule 56 \nmotion for summary judgment.\u201d Id. at 695\u201396 \n(citation omitted). \nFinally, LabCorp states that Fifth Circuit \u201chas not \nsquarely addressed\u201d the question, but suggests that it \nwould adopt the view that Article III bars certification \nif any class members are uninjured. See Pet. 15. In \nfact, the Fifth Circuit has held that \u201c[c]lass certifi-\ncation is not precluded simply because a class may \ninclude persons who have not been injured by the \ndefendant\u2019s conduct.\u201d Mims v. Stewart Title Guar. Co., \n590 F.3d 298, 308 (5th Cir. 2009) (citing Kohen, 571 \nF.3d at 677); see id. (\u201cThe district court was not \nrequired to determine that every class member had \n\n \n30 \nsuffered damages as a prerequisite to class certifica-\ntion.\u201d).6  \nIn sum, in every circuit, the existence of uninjured \nclass members may inform whether a proposed class \nsatisfies the requirements of Rule 23(b)(3). In no \ncircuit is it necessary to prove that every member was \ninjured for the class action to be certified or the case \nto be justiciable. \nB. The courts of appeals are correct that \nArticle III does not bar certification \nwhere some class members may be \nuninjured. \nThe critical point by which uninjured class \nmembers (if any) must be excluded from a \nRule 23(b)(3) class and from receiving a share of a \njudgment for damages is not at the time of class \ncertification, but at the time the claims are resolved \non the merits. This conclusion is consistent with both \nlongstanding Article III principles and Rule 23.  \n1. As this Court has repeatedly held, an Article III \n\u201ccase or controversy\u201d exists when one plaintiff has \nstanding. See, e.g., Horne, 557 U.S. at 446\u201347 (\u201c[W]e \nhave at least one individual plaintiff who has \ndemonstrated standing .... Because of the presence of \n\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013 \n6 The single-judge opinion on which LabCorp relies, In re \nDeepwater Horizon, 732 F.3d 326 (5th Cir. 2013) (opinion of \nClement, J.), did not address the issue. Rather, in the context of \nconsidering proposed modifications to an existing settlement of \nclaims arising from the Deepwater Horizon explosion, one judge \nopined that an uninjured claimant should not be able to recover. \nId. at 341\u201342 (stating that Rule 23 and Article III do not \n\u201c[a]llow[] recovery from the settlement fund by those who have \nno case and cannot state a claim\u201d). That issue, addressed by this \nCourt in Tyson Foods, 577 U.S. at 460, is not presented here. \n\n \n31 \nthis plaintiff, we need not consider whether the other \nindividual and corporate plaintiffs have standing to \nmaintain the suit.\u201d (quoting Vill. of Arlington Heights, \n429 U.S. at 264 & n.9)). The same principles that \napply to individual claims apply to class claims, \nwhich, \u201clike traditional joinder, ... leaves the parties\u2019 \nlegal rights and duties intact and the rules of decision \nunchanged.\u201d Shady Grove Orthopedic Assocs., P.A. v. \nAllstate Ins. Co., 559 U.S. 393, 408 (2010) (plurality \nopinion). Although the Court has announced this \nprinciple most clearly in cases involving injunctive \nrelief, it applies irrespective of the relief sought: If a \nsingle class member\u2019s injury suffices to create a \njusticiable \ncontroversy, \nthe \ncontroversy \nexists \nwhether the form of redress is compensatory or \npreventive. \nThus, the presence of uninjured members in a class \ndoes not render the case nonjusticiable. The merits \nquestion of whether all members can demonstrate \nentitlement to relief, although it may impact the \nRule 23(b)(3) predominance determination, does not \nimpact a court\u2019s authority to entertain the claims. See \nBouaphakeo v. Tyson Foods, Inc., 593 F. App\u2019x 578, \n585 (8th Cir. 2014) (opinion of Benton, J., respecting \nthe denial of rehearing en banc) (\u201cThe failure of some \nemployees to demonstrate damages goes to the merits, \nnot jurisdiction.\u201d), aff\u2019d, 577 U.S. 442 (2016). \nJurisdiction \u201cis not defeated\u201d by a plaintiff\u2019s inability \nto demonstrate that he can \u201cactually recover.\u201d Bell v. \nHood, 327 U.S. 678, 682 (1946); see Warth v. Seldin, \n422 U.S. 490, 498 (1975).  \nTo hold otherwise would be to require every \nplaintiff seeking damages\u2014in both individual and \nclass-action cases\u2014to prove her case prior to trial to \navoid a jurisdictional dismissal under Rule 12(b)(1). \n\n \n32 \nAnd if a plaintiff who failed to establish damages at \ntrial lacked standing, the proper resolution would not \nbe judgment in the defendant\u2019s favor, but a \njurisdictional dismissal without res judicata effect. \nSee Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better Env\u2019t, 523 U.S. 83, \n94 (1998). Such a novel rule would waste judicial \nresources, benefit neither plaintiffs nor defendants, \nand contradict the longstanding recognition that \nfailure to prove entitlement to relief requires a merits \njudgment, not a jurisdictional dismissal. See Gen. Inv. \nCo. v. N.Y. Cent. R.R. Co., 271 U.S. 228, 230\u201331 \n(1926); Bell, 327 U.S. at 682; see also Kohen, 571 F.3d \nat 677 (noting that \u201cwhen a plaintiff loses a [damages] \ncase [at trial] because he cannot prove injury the suit \nis not dismissed for lack of jurisdiction\u201d). \n2. Conditioning certification on proof that all class \nmembers were injured would, in many cases, create \npractical conundrums at odds with Rule 23\u2019s structure \nand purpose. Rule 23(c)(1)(A) requires certification at \nan \u201cearly practicable time,\u201d yet assessing class \nmembers\u2019 injuries at certification is often infeasible \nbecause their identities are unknown. In many cases, \nfor a class to \u201cinclude persons who have not been \ninjured by the defendant\u2019s conduct \u2026 is almost \ninevitable because at the outset of the case many of \nthe members of the class may be unknown, or if they \nare known still the facts bearing on their claims may \nbe unknown.\u201d Kohen, 571 F.3d at 677. In addition, \nbecause class certification can be revisited, see Fed. R. \nCiv. P. 23(c)(1)(C), Rule 23\u2019s central efficiency goals \nwould be thwarted by requiring decertification based \non a showing, at any stage, that any members of a \ncertified class were uninjured. See Neale, 794 F.3d at \n364 (\u201cRequiring individual standing of all class \nmembers would eviscerate the representative nature \n\n \n33 \nof the class action.\u201d). Further, if uninjured members \ncome to light during litigation, several procedural \nsolutions are available: narrowing the class; summary \njudgment as to the uninjured members; instructing \nthe jury not to base any award of damages on \nuninjured individuals; or requiring a process to \nidentify such members and exclude them from sharing \nin a classwide damages award. See, e.g., Tyson Foods, \n577 U.S. at 460\u201362 (remanding for trial-court proceed-\nings to identify class members, if any, who had no \ndamages). \nCONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, the petition for a writ of \ncertiorari should be denied. \nRespectfully submitted, \nBENJAMIN JAMES SWEET \nNICOLAS SANSONE \n   Counsel of Record \nALLISON M.

          "task_beliefs": "My understanding of the petitioner's case in *Labcorp v. Davis* remains stable and robust, grounded in the detailed analysis of their Petition for a Writ of Certiorari. This new observation, an internal reflection, does not add new external facts but critically refines my model of the task by explicitly identifying and prioritizing my current uncertainty.\n\n*   **Petitioner's Arguments & Strategy (Stable):** My knowledge of LabCorp's two-pronged attack remains unchanged. They argue that the class certification fails both the statutory predominance requirement of Rule 23(b)(3) due to the need for individual injury inquiries, and the constitutional requirement of Article III, which they contend bars the certification of any class containing uninjured members.\n*   **Key Precedents & Legal Framework (Stable):** My focus remains on the interpretation of *TransUnion LLC v. Ramirez*, *Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes*, and *Comcast Corp. v. Behrend*, as these are the precedents LabCorp has placed at the center of the dispute.\n*   **Factual & Policy Framing (Stable):** LabCorp's framing of the case around the risk of \"extorted settlements\" and their minimization of the harm experienced by customers remain key elements of my understanding of their persuasive strategy.\n*   **Case Significance Signal (Stable):** The involvement of former Solicitor General Noel J. Francisco continues to be a strong signal of the case's perceived importance and the quality of the petitioner's advocacy.\n*   **Refined Uncertainty Model (New):** This reflective step has crystallized the primary gap in my knowledge. My understanding is currently heavily skewed towards the petitioner. The most significant uncertainty, and therefore the most critical area for future information gathering, is the respondent's position. I have now formally identified the need to discover how Davis et al. will:\n    1.  Counter the claim of a deep circuit split.\n    2.  Distinguish or reinterpret *TransUnion v. Ramirez*.\n    3.  Argue that common questions still predominate despite the presence of potentially uninjured class members.\n    My confidence in any prediction is currently low and will remain so until this information imbalance is rectified.",
          "design_beliefs": "This observation, which consists of internal reasoning, has validated my existing strategies and introduced a crucial new meta-heuristic for managing the research process itself. My methodology is becoming more self-aware and efficient.\n\n*   **Source Value Confirmation (Stable):** The high value of primary legal documents like the cert petition is unchanged. My sequential plan to analyze these documents remains the core of my strategy.\n*   **Heuristic - \"Deconstruct the Cert Petition\" (Stable):** The method of breaking down a cert petition into its constituent parts (Question Presented, Circuit Split, Legal Arguments, Policy Stakes, Table of Authorities) remains a confirmed and effective heuristic.\n*   **Heuristic - \"Follow the Advocate\" (Stable):** The practice of using the identity of the legal counsel as a proxy for case significance and argument quality remains a valuable tool.\n*   **Refined Information Gathering Plan (Reinforced):** My sequential plan (1. Petition -> 2. Opposition Brief -> 3. Amicus Briefs -> 4. Precedent Analysis) is strongly reinforced. The current \"THINK\" step serves as a logical bridge, confirming that moving from the petition to the opposition brief is the correct next action to address the most significant uncertainty.\n*   **New Meta-Heuristic - \"Reflective Gap Analysis\" (New):** A powerful new meta-level strategy has emerged from this observation. This heuristic involves periodically pausing the information-gathering process to perform a structured self-assessment. The steps are:\n    1.  **Synthesize Knowledge:** Summarize the current state of task-level beliefs (\u03b8).\n    2.  **Identify Imbalances & Gaps:** Explicitly identify which areas are well-understood and which are characterized by high uncertainty or a lack of information (e.g., \"my knowledge is skewed towards the petitioner\").\n    3.  **Prioritize Next Action:** Formulate the next information-gathering action specifically to target the most significant identified gap.\n    This meta-heuristic ensures that the research process is not just a checklist but an efficient, targeted search for the most valuable information to reduce uncertainty and improve the quality of the final prediction. It transforms the process from simply collecting data to strategically building a balanced and robust model of the legal problem."

          "task_beliefs": "My model of this case has been dramatically enriched by acquiring the respondent's arguments, moving from a one-sided view based on the petitioner's framing to a balanced, dialectical understanding of the cert-stage battle. The primary uncertainty I previously identified has now been resolved, replaced by a more nuanced uncertainty about how the Supreme Court will weigh these competing narratives.\n\n*   **Petitioner's Arguments & Strategy (Stable but Contextualized):** My understanding of LabCorp's arguments\u2014that Rule 23(b)(3) and Article III both bar class certification when uninjured members are present\u2014remains stable. However, these arguments are no longer unopposed. They are now contextualized as one side of a debate, and the respondent's brief suggests LabCorp may have overstated the circuit split and mischaracterized the nature of the injury.\n*   **Respondent's Arguments & Strategy (New):** This observation has filled the most significant gap in my knowledge. I now understand the respondent's multi-faceted strategy for defeating cert:\n    1.  **Reframe the Injury & Deny the Premise:** The core of their opposition is that LabCorp's question is not presented by this case. They argue the injury is not the failure to receive medical services, but the denial of \"full and equal enjoyment\" of the LabCorp Express kiosk service\u2014an injury all class members suffered by definition. LabCorp's claim of providing an alternative (staff assistance) is positioned as a merits defense, not a standing issue.\n    2.  **Assert Waiver:** They argue LabCorp waived the Article III question as it applies to the nationwide Rule 23(b)(2) injunctive relief class by failing to raise it on appeal, instead focusing on other issues like typicality and the feasibility of a uniform remedy.\n    3.  **Dispute the Circuit Split:** They contend the circuit split LabCorp alleges is illusory. They argue all circuits treat the presence of uninjured members as a factor in the Rule 23 predominance and commonality analysis, not as a threshold Article III jurisdictional bar. They accuse LabCorp of misrepresenting circuit court holdings through \"out-of-context quotations.\"\n    4.  **Distinguish Precedent:** They argue that as long as the named plaintiffs have standing, Article III is satisfied at the certification stage, and the potential for uninjured members to be identified and removed later does not defeat jurisdiction for the entire class. This is their counter to LabCorp's reliance on *TransUnion v. Ramirez*.\n*   **Key Precedents & Legal Framework (Expanded):** My legal map of this case has grown. While *TransUnion*, *Wal-Mart*, and *Comcast* remain central from the petitioner's side, the respondent's brief introduces a crucial counter-canon. Cases like *Kohen v. Pacific Investment Management Co.* (7th Cir.) and *Olean Wholesale Grocery Cooperative, Inc. v. Bumble Bee Foods LLC* (9th Cir.) are now important as they support the view that uninjured class members are a Rule 23 manageability issue. *Tyson Foods, Inc. v. Bouaphakeo* is also now relevant for the principle that individual proof issues can be handled post-certification.\n*   **Factual & Policy Framing (Balanced):** The narrative is no longer solely about \"extorted settlements.\" The respondent provides a powerful counter-narrative emphasizing LabCorp's deliberate, cost-cutting decision to deploy inaccessible technology despite knowing the harm and having accessible alternatives. This frames the case around corporate responsibility and the dignitary harm of discrimination.\n*   **Case Significance Signal (Balanced):** The involvement of Noel Francisco for the petitioner is now balanced by the appearance of Nicolas Sansone of Public Citizen Litigation Group for the respondents. Public Citizen is a highly respected public interest firm with significant Supreme Court experience. This matchup of elite advocates signals to the Court that this is a serious, well-briefed dispute, increasing the perceived importance of the legal questions while also ensuring the Court will hear high-quality arguments against granting cert.",
          "design_beliefs": "This observation has powerfully validated my evolving research methodology. The successful targeting and acquisition of the respondent's brief confirms the efficacy of my self-assessment process and has led to a more sophisticated understanding of cert-stage strategy.\n\n*   **Source Value Confirmation (Reinforced):** The supreme value of primary legal documents is again confirmed. The Brief in Opposition was the single most valuable piece of information I could have acquired, directly addressing the primary gap in my knowledge.\n*   **Heuristic - \"Deconstruct the Cert Petition\" (Evolved):** This heuristic has evolved into a more comprehensive strategy: **\"Deconstruct the Cert-Stage Dialectic.\"** Effective prediction requires not just understanding the petitioner's claims but analyzing the direct interplay between the Petition for Certiorari and the Brief in Opposition. The core of the task is to see how the respondent reframes the question, counters the arguments, disputes the stakes, and provides the Court with \"off-ramps\" to deny the petition.\n*   **Heuristic - \"Follow the Advocate\" (Refined):** This heuristic is now more nuanced. It's not just about the presence of a star advocate, but the *matchup*. A contest between two highly respected advocates from different sides of the bar (e.g., Jones Day vs. Public Citizen) signals a high-quality, serious dispute. This tells me the Court will have excellent briefing on both sides, making the substance of the legal arguments, rather than just advocacy quality, the likely driver of their decision.\n*   **Meta-Heuristic - \"Reflective Gap Analysis\" (Validated):** The new meta-heuristic I developed in the previous step has been proven highly effective. Pausing to synthesize my knowledge, identify the \"skew\" towards the petitioner, and prioritize finding the respondent's brief was the correct strategic move. This confirms the value of periodically stepping back from data collection to assess the state of the model and plan the next action with maximum efficiency.\n*   **New Meta-Heuristic - \"Identify the Off-Ramps\" (New):** A crucial new lens for analysis has emerged. When evaluating the likelihood of a cert grant, it is essential to actively search for procedural or factual arguments that allow the Court to avoid deciding the \"Question Presented,\" even if it seems legally significant. The Brief in Opposition is the primary source for these \"off-ramps.\" In this case, the respondents have provided at least three: 1) waiver (for the injunctive class), 2) poor vehicle (the facts don't actually present the question), and 3) no genuine circuit split. Identifying these is critical to a robust prediction.\n*   **Information Gathering Plan (Confirmed & Advanced):** My sequential plan (1. Petition -> 2. Opposition Brief -> 3. Amicus Briefs -> 4. Precedent Analysis) is working perfectly. Having completed the first two steps and established the core dialectic, the next logical action is to analyze the amicus briefs to gauge the scope of interest in the case from outside parties (e.g., business groups, disability rights advocates) and see which arguments they choose to amplify."

Those companies rep-\nresent more than 4.5 million employees and countless \ncustomers in the fields of information technology, \ne-commerce, the sharing and gig economies, advanced \nenergy, cybersecurity, venture capital, and finance.  \nTechNet\u2019s members have first-hand experience with \nthe harmful effects of aggregating claims of uninjured \npeople through class actions that violate Article III \nand Rule 23. \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nI.  The certification of classes with uninjured mem-\nbers presents an enormous problem for all companies, \nbut especially those in the innovation economy. \nA.  Class-certification orders create immense pres-\nsure on defendants to settle, even when the order is er-\nroneous and the plaintiffs\u2019 claims are weak.  Microsoft \nCorp. v. Baker, 582 U.S. 23, 29 (2017).  Those pres-\nsures reach unacceptable levels when plaintiffs are al-\nlowed to include members who suffered no Article III \ninjury in their proposed classes.  Particularly where \nplaintiffs seek statutory penalties or punitive dam-\nages, the potential monetary exposure in overinflated \nmulti-million-member classes will all too often force \n \n * Under this Court\u2019s Rule 37.6, no counsel for a party authored \nthis brief in whole or in part, and no person or entity other than \namici or their counsel made a monetary contribution intended to \nfund the preparation or submission of this brief. \n\n2 \n \ndefendants to give up the game early\u2014no matter how \nweak the aggregated claims\u2014rather than face the \nlong, expensive slog of class litigation, high-stakes tri-\nals, and complex appeals.   \nFor tech companies at the forefront of innovation \nand growth, these problems are especially acute.  The \ndigital economy has thrived by bringing massive num-\nbers of people together on platforms featuring all \nmanner of commerce and speech.  But the size of those \nplatforms provides an alluring target for class-action \nplaintiffs, who often rely on general allegations about \nthe tech companies to lump millions of differently sit-\nuated users into massive classes.  And given the com-\nplexity of the platforms, courts too often are tempted \nto skip the difficult task of separating injured from un-\ninjured users, or at least to defer that essential work \nuntil after classes are certified.  But class certification \ntypically forces an in terrorem settlement\u2014so in prac-\ntice, waiting until after certification to decide whether \na class sweeps in people who lack any actual injury \nmeans there will never be an adjudication of whether \nclass members have Article III standing. \nB.  The Ninth Circuit has looked the other way \nwhen it comes to uninjured class members, approving \ncertification so long as the number of uninjured mem-\nbers is not too \u201c\u2018great.\u2019\u201d  Olean Wholesale Grocery Co-\noperative, Inc. v. Bumble Bee Foods LLC, 31 F.4th 651, \n669 n.14 (9th Cir. 2022) (en banc) (citation omitted).  \nIn recent years, the Ninth Circuit has seen the certi-\nfication of staggeringly broad class actions against \ntech companies that seek billions of dollars on behalf \nof millions of class members whose claims the district \ncourt may have no jurisdiction to adjudicate.  The \ntrack record under the Ninth Circuit\u2019s rule shows the \n\n3 \n \nmischief invited by a permissive approach to Arti-\ncle III at class certification.   \nII.  The Ninth Circuit\u2019s permissive approach and \nthe decisions it has produced are an affront to Arti-\ncle III and Rule 23(b)(3) alike. \nA.  The Constitution limits the \u201cjudicial Power\u201d to \n\u201cCases\u201d and \u201cControversies,\u201d Art. III, \u00a7 2, requiring all \nplaintiffs in federal court to show an injury in fact \nthat\u2019s traceable to the defendant\u2019s conduct and likely \nto be redressed by a favorable decision.  Lujan v. De-\nfenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 561 (1992).  That \nmandate isn\u2019t limited to the end of the case; the plain-\ntiff must comply at each \u201csuccessive stag[e] of the liti-\ngation.\u201d  Ibid.  And when a party seeking relief joins a \ncase that\u2019s already underway, he \u201cmust establish [his] \nown Article III standing.\u201d  Town of Chester v. Laroe \nEstates, Inc., 581 U.S. 433, 442 (2017). \nNothing about those constitutional requirements \nchanges when it comes to a class action, which is \nsimply a procedural device for aggregating and resolv-\ning the claims of absent class members all at once.  \nSprint Communications Co. v. APCC Services, Inc., \n554 U.S. 269, 291 (2008).  This Court has already held \nthat \u201cArticle III does not give federal courts the power \nto order relief to any uninjured plaintiff, class action \nor not.\u201d  TransUnion LLC v. Ramirez, 594 U.S. 413, \n431 (2021) (citation omitted).  It should now clarify that \n\u201cno class may be certified that contains members lack-\ning Article III standing.\u201d  E.g., Denney v. Deutsche Bank \nAG, 443 F.3d 253, 264 (2d Cir. 2006).  Because stand-\ning \u201cis not dispensed in gross,\u201d plaintiffs must show \nan Article III basis for \u201ceach claim\u201d in the case, Daim-\nlerChrysler Corp. v. Cuno, 547 U.S. 332, 352-353 (2006) \n(citation omitted)\u2014including claims of absent class \nmembers brought into the action through a certification \n\n4 \n \norder.  Any other view would allow a procedural rule \nto subvert Article III and permit federal courts to ex-\nercise purely \u201c\u2018hypothetical jurisdiction\u2019\u201d over the \nclaims of people who suffered no injury in fact.  Steel \nCo. v. Citizens for a Better Environment, 523 U.S. 83, \n101 (1998). \nB.  It\u2019s not enough to ensure, at class certification, \nthat the class is defined to include only injured mem-\nbers.  To recover, the named plaintiff ultimately will \nhave to be able to prove, by final judgment, that each \nmember of a Rule 23(b)(3) class in fact has Article III \nstanding.  TransUnion, 594 U.S. at 431.  And that in \nturn raises serious questions, at class certification, \nabout whether the plaintiff can show that \u201cquestions \nof law or fact common to class members predominate \nover any questions affecting only individual mem-\nbers.\u201d  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3).  That especially \u201cde-\nmanding\u201d predominance requirement is often what \nprecludes certification.  Comcast Corp. v. Behrend, \n569 U.S. 27, 34 (2013). \nThe Ninth Circuit\u2019s approach sidesteps those is-\nsues.  In its view, everything comes down to numbers:  \nIt\u2019s no bother if a class includes more than a \u201cde mini-\nmis\u201d number of uninjured members, so long as that \nnumber doesn\u2019t become \u201cgreat\u201d (whatever that means).  \nOlean, 31 F.4th at 669 & n.14 (citation omitted).  But \nwhat matters for Rule 23(b)(3) isn\u2019t the number of un-\ninjured class members, but whether it is possible to \n\u201c\u2018segregate the uninjured from the truly injured\u2019\u201d\u2014\nand if that\u2019s going to require \u201cfull-blown, individual \ntrials,\u201d then no class proceeding should go forward.  In \nre Rail Freight Fuel Surcharge Antitrust Litigation, \n934 F.3d 619, 625 (D.C. Cir. 2019) (citation omitted).  \nUnless plaintiffs offer a compelling plan to resolve the \nquestion of Article III standing on a classwide basis, \n\n5 \n \nthey should not be permitted to invoke the exception \nof class litigation, with all the pressures and constitu-\ntional concerns it raises. \nARGUMENT \nI. \nCertifying classes with uninjured members \ncreates immense settlement pressure and \nthreatens innovation in the tech industry. \nThis Court has long recognized that \u201ccertification \nof a large class may so increase the defendant\u2019s poten-\ntial damages liability and litigation costs that he may \nfind it economically prudent to settle and to abandon \na meritorious defense.\u201d  Microsoft Corp. v. Baker, 582 \nU.S. 23, 29 (2017) (brackets omitted) (quoting Coopers \n& Lybrand v. Livesay, 437 U.S. 463, 476 (1978)).  Per-\nmitting plaintiffs to swell the ranks of their proposed \nclasses with members who suffered no injury, and to \nseek statutory penalties and punitive damages on be-\nhalf of such uninjured people, ratchets up that settle-\nment pressure to crushing levels.  Nowhere are those \neffects more gravely felt than in the tech industry, \nwhere digital platforms have led to stunning growth\u2014\nbut where, given the expanse of the platforms and the \nvolume of e-commerce, defendants\u2019 potential exposure \nquickly becomes astronomical. \nA. Tech companies are all-too tempting \ntargets for oversized class actions. \nThe American story can be told through the lens of \ntechnological innovation.  And over the last decade, a \nrevolutionary advance in \u201conline structures that ena-\nble a wide range of human activities\u201d has produced \n\u201cradical changes in how we work, socialize, create value \nin the economy, and compete for the resulting profits.\u201d  \nKenney & Zysman, The Rise of the Platform Economy, \nIssues in Science & Technology (Spring 2016), \n\n6 \n \nhttps://tinyurl.com/mr3ss3mz.  Tech companies in-\ncreasingly offer online platforms where millions of peo-\nple communicate and do business.  As those platforms \nhave grown, so too have their usefulness:  \u201cThey benefit \nfrom the network effect, so providing greater value\u201d the \nmore users take part.  Colback, The Rise of the Plat-\nform Economy, Financial Times (Mar. 13, 2023), \nhttps://tinyurl.com/5xryrkna.   \n\u201cDigital transformation is now affecting every \nbusiness sector,\u201d \u201cevery industry,\u201d and \u201cevery aspect \nof our life.\u201d  Minevich, 20 Leading Social Impact Plat-\nforms Making a Difference with Digital Potential, \nForbes (Aug. 3, 2021), https://tinyurl.com/mvxuapjh.  \nThe companies offering digital platforms for people to \nmeet, trade, and work range from tiny startups to some \nof the world\u2019s largest companies.  And the platforms, \nthrough their network effects, offer new opportunities \nfor innovation each year.  E.g., Persistence Market Re-\nsearch, Digital Experience Platform Market to Hit USD \n19.3 Billion by 2030 Due to Digital Transformation In-\nitiatives and E-commerce Growth, Yahoo! Finance \n(Jan. 11, 2024), https://tinyurl.com/mv9xun3h.  \nThe sheer reach of these digital platforms is un-\nprecedented.  For instance, Facebook, YouTube, Insta-\ngram, and WhatsApp each have more than 2 billion ac-\ntive users each month.  Most Popular Social Networks \nWorldwide as of April 2024, Statista, https://ti-\nnyurl.com/2s3jmdzy (visited Mar. 10, 2025).  Over 90% \nof Americans now own a smartphone and thus take ad-\nvantage of an array of mobile apps and platforms.

How \nMany Companies Use Cloud Computing in 2024?, Edge \nDelta (May 17, 2024), https://tinyurl.com/5chzmzu8.  \n\n7 \n \nAnd so on.  The more people and businesses turn to \ndigital platforms, the more value they generate; by \n2028, the digital economy is slated to reach $16.5 tril-\nlion.  Ang, Global Digital Economy Will Hit US$16.5 \nTrillion by 2028, Business Times (Aug. 19, 2024), \nhttps://tinyurl.com/237earzc.  \nDigital platforms are also a great equalizer, offer-\ning even small startups the chance to put their digital \nproducts or services in front of millions of potential \ncustomers in a span of weeks.  Most of the digital econ-\nomy is driven not by a few massive companies, but by \nsmaller apps and websites.  For example, while Insta-\ngram may have more than 2 billion active users each \nmonth, Instagram\u2019s nearly 640 million app downloads \nin 2024 is dwarfed by the nearly 110 billion downloads \nacross all consumer mobile apps that year, with more \nthan 85% of consumer mobile app revenue coming \nfrom mobile apps outside the largest ten.  Perez, App \nDownloads Decline 2.3% in 2024, but Consumer \nSpending Grows to $127B, TechCrunch (Dec. 18, \n2024), https://tinyurl.com/4bup4nr3. \nFor plaintiffs interested in bringing Rule 23(b)(3) \ndamages class actions, the size of even nascent digital \nplatforms and the potential for easy recovery via an \ninflated class offer an irresistible opportunity.  Often \nwith little more than vague allegations about a tech \ncompany\u2019s practices or a platform\u2019s policies, plaintiffs \ncan quickly arrive at proposed classes numbering well \ninto the millions.  The exposure associated with those \nproposed classes can be staggering, too.  As uninjured \nmembers increase the estimated class size, so in-\ncreases the money being demanded and the starting \npoint for any settlement negotiations\u2014especially \nwhere the plaintiffs argue that every member of an \nenormous class, even those who weren\u2019t actually in-\n\n8 \n \njured by the challenged practice, should be entitled to \nstatutory penalties and punitive damages.  See, e.g., \nTransUnion LLC v. Ramirez, 594 U.S. 413, 421-422 \n(2021) (involving verdict that stacked statutory and \npunitive damages for uninjured class members).  Plus, \ngiven the complexity and scale of digital platforms, it \ncan often be difficult to determine which particular \nusers, if any, were affected by a challenged practice.  \nSo plaintiffs have every incentive to load up their clas-\nses with everyone who may have encountered the \nplatform or viewed products or services online, and to \nask the court to disregard the problem of uninjured \nmembers\u2014or at least kick the injury can down the \nroad to some later stage of the proceedings.   \nThese sorts of overinflated class actions have seri-\nous, harmful consequences.  Even an erroneous class-\ncertification order \u201cmay force a defendant to settle ra-\nther than run the risk of potentially ruinous liability.\u201d  \nBaker, 582 U.S. at 41-42 (ellipsis omitted) (quoting \nFed. R. Civ. P. 23(f) advisory committee\u2019s note to 1998 \namendment).  That\u2019s in part because the prospect of \nwinning at trial or reversing class certification in an \neventual appeal doesn\u2019t erase the \u201cextensive discovery \nand the potential for uncertainty and disruption\u201d that \nforce class-action defendants to settle in the first \nplace.  Stoneridge Investment Partners, LLC v. Scien-\ntific-Atlanta, Inc., 552 U.S. 148, 163 (2008).  Such \u201c\u2018in \nterrorem\u2019 settlements\u201d are an open secret by now.  \nAT&T Mobility LLC v. Concepcion, 563 U.S. 333, 350 \n(2011); see Pet. Br. 32-33.  The unprecedented expanse \nof class actions against tech companies makes those \npressures all but unbearable.   \nIf left unchecked, these sorts of sweeping class ac-\ntions will harm innovation.  The digital economy has \nbeen so successful, and so beneficial to consumers, \n\n9 \n \nprecisely because tech companies have engineered \nways to reduce barriers to entry and to facilitate com-\nmunication and e-commerce on a massive scale.  But \nif plaintiffs are permitted to bring class actions, secure \nclass certification, and make demands based on every \nuser of those platforms\u2014no matter whether the users \nwere actually injured by the challenged conduct\u2014\nthen companies will be pressured to restrict usage of \nthe platforms or else face potentially ruinous liability.  \nThat would have untold consequences for the econ-\nomy, for society, for speech, and more.  \nThose consequences wouldn\u2019t be confined to mas-\nsive companies with the coffers to ward them off.  In \nfact, the harmful effects of an overly permissive ap-\nproach to classes with uninjured members could be \nfelt most acutely among the highly innovative small \nand midsize businesses and startups that have lim-\nited resources, but that nonetheless are pioneering \ntechnological breakthroughs that will define tomor-\nrow\u2019s tech industry.  Those companies may be able, \nthanks to low barriers to entry in the modern digital \neconomy, to reach millions of consumers at once.  But \nthey wouldn\u2019t have the resources to face down an ex-\ntortionate class action loaded with people who suf-\nfered no injury.  For those companies, the only choice \nwould be to settle early or close up shop.  In either \ncase, looking the other way while plaintiffs flout Arti-\ncle III and funnel the claims of uninjured people into \nfederal court leaves those companies less likely to \nbring their innovations to market, threatening the \nprogress and prosperity that the digital economy \npromises.  \n\n10 \n \nB. The Ninth Circuit\u2019s rule has greenlit  \ninflated \nclass \nactions \nagainst \ntech \ncompanies. \nThe Ninth Circuit has disregarded the coercive ef-\nfects of overinflated classes and instead adopted a per-\nmissive approach to assessing Article III standing at \nclass certification.  It holds that district courts can \noverlook \u201cthe possible presence of uninjured class \nmembers,\u201d so long as the number is not too \u201c\u2018great.\u2019\u201d  \nOlean Wholesale Grocery Cooperative, Inc. v. Bumble \nBee Foods LLC, 31 F.4th 651, 669 n.14 (9th Cir. 2022) \n(en banc) (citation omitted).  In Olean, for example, \nthe Ninth Circuit held that the district court could de-\nfer resolving all issues of class member standing until \ntrial even though expert evidence suggested that 28% \nof class members suffered no injury.  Id. at 680-681; \nid. at 686 (Lee, J., dissenting). \nThe Ninth Circuit\u2019s hands-off approach to Arti-\ncle III standing at class certification has unleashed \noversized class actions\u2014especially against tech com-\npanies.  The facts of this case illustrate the concerns \nwith allowing named plaintiffs to shoot for the moon \nin their class definitions.  Pet. Br. 43-44.  But other \ncases shine an even harsher light on the inconsistency \nof the Ninth Circuit\u2019s rule with Article III\u2019s limit on \nthe cases and controversies fit for federal court. \nA prime example is what happened after this \nCourt\u2019s decision in Apple Inc. v. Pepper, 587 U.S. 273 \n(2019).  There, this Court held that antitrust claims \ncould go forward on the theory that the plaintiffs \n\u201cpa[id] [an] alleged overcharge directly to Apple\u201d \nwhen they bought apps in the App Store.  Id. at 281.  \nThe plaintiffs on remand sought to certify a class of \nanyone in the United States who paid Apple more than \n$10 for an app or in-app purchase, which amounted to \n\n11 \n \naround 125 million App Store accounts.  In re Apple \niPhone Antitrust Litigation, No. 4:11-cv-6714, Dkt. 789 \nat 2 (N.D. Cal. Feb. 2, 2024).  The plaintiffs\u2019 own expert \nestimated that almost 8% of the proposed class (more \nthan 10 million accounts) would not have paid any \novercharge\u2014the critical element from this Court\u2019s de-\ncision.  Id. at 25.  The district court even professed its \n\u201cconcer[n]\u201d about the number of \u201cuninjured ac-\ncounts\u201d\u2014but using the 28% figure from Olean as a \nbenchmark, it accepted the plaintiffs\u2019 \u201csurmise\u201d that \nthey\u2019d later be able to identify uninjured class mem-\nbers by refining their model and certified the class any-\nway.  Id. at 25-26.  That certify-first, analyze-standing-\nlater approach resulted in a massively oversized class \naction in which the district court took jurisdiction ove\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

Those companies rep-\nresent more than 4.5 million employees and countless \ncustomers in the fields of information technology, \ne-commerce, the sharing and gig economies, advanced \nenergy, cybersecurity, venture capital, and finance.  \nTechNet\u2019s members have first-hand experience with \nthe harmful effects of aggregating claims of uninjured \npeople through class actions that violate Article III \nand Rule 23. \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nI.  The certification of classes with uninjured mem-\nbers presents an enormous problem for all companies, \nbut especially those in the innovation economy. \nA.  Class-certification orders create immense pres-\nsure on defendants to settle, even when the order is er-\nroneous and the plaintiffs\u2019 claims are weak.  Microsoft \nCorp. v. Baker, 582 U.S. 23, 29 (2017).  Those pres-\nsures reach unacceptable levels when plaintiffs are al-\nlowed to include members who suffered no Article III \ninjury in their proposed classes.  Particularly where \nplaintiffs seek statutory penalties or punitive dam-\nages, the potential monetary exposure in overinflated \nmulti-million-member classes will all too often force \n \n * Under this Court\u2019s Rule 37.6, no counsel for a party authored \nthis brief in whole or in part, and no person or entity other than \namici or their counsel made a monetary contribution intended to \nfund the preparation or submission of this brief. \n\n2 \n \ndefendants to give up the game early\u2014no matter how \nweak the aggregated claims\u2014rather than face the \nlong, expensive slog of class litigation, high-stakes tri-\nals, and complex appeals.   \nFor tech companies at the forefront of innovation \nand growth, these problems are especially acute.  The \ndigital economy has thrived by bringing massive num-\nbers of people together on platforms featuring all \nmanner of commerce and speech.  But the size of those \nplatforms provides an alluring target for class-action \nplaintiffs, who often rely on general allegations about \nthe tech companies to lump millions of differently sit-\nuated users into massive classes.  And given the com-\nplexity of the platforms, courts too often are tempted \nto skip the difficult task of separating injured from un-\ninjured users, or at least to defer that essential work \nuntil after classes are certified.  But class certification \ntypically forces an in terrorem settlement\u2014so in prac-\ntice, waiting until after certification to decide whether \na class sweeps in people who lack any actual injury \nmeans there will never be an adjudication of whether \nclass members have Article III standing. \nB.  The Ninth Circuit has looked the other way \nwhen it comes to uninjured class members, approving \ncertification so long as the number of uninjured mem-\nbers is not too \u201c\u2018great.\u2019\u201d  Olean Wholesale Grocery Co-\noperative, Inc. v. Bumble Bee Foods LLC, 31 F.4th 651, \n669 n.14 (9th Cir. 2022) (en banc) (citation omitted).  \nIn recent years, the Ninth Circuit has seen the certi-\nfication of staggeringly broad class actions against \ntech companies that seek billions of dollars on behalf \nof millions of class members whose claims the district \ncourt may have no jurisdiction to adjudicate.  The \ntrack record under the Ninth Circuit\u2019s rule shows the \n\n3 \n \nmischief invited by a permissive approach to Arti-\ncle III at class certification.   \nII.  The Ninth Circuit\u2019s permissive approach and \nthe decisions it has produced are an affront to Arti-\ncle III and Rule 23(b)(3) alike. \nA.  The Constitution limits the \u201cjudicial Power\u201d to \n\u201cCases\u201d and \u201cControversies,\u201d Art. III, \u00a7 2, requiring all \nplaintiffs in federal court to show an injury in fact \nthat\u2019s traceable to the defendant\u2019s conduct and likely \nto be redressed by a favorable decision.  Lujan v. De-\nfenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 561 (1992).  That \nmandate isn\u2019t limited to the end of the case; the plain-\ntiff must comply at each \u201csuccessive stag[e] of the liti-\ngation.\u201d  Ibid.  And when a party seeking relief joins a \ncase that\u2019s already underway, he \u201cmust establish [his] \nown Article III standing.\u201d  Town of Chester v. Laroe \nEstates, Inc., 581 U.S. 433, 442 (2017). \nNothing about those constitutional requirements \nchanges when it comes to a class action, which is \nsimply a procedural device for aggregating and resolv-\ning the claims of absent class members all at once.  \nSprint Communications Co. v. APCC Services, Inc., \n554 U.S. 269, 291 (2008).  This Court has already held \nthat \u201cArticle III does not give federal courts the power \nto order relief to any uninjured plaintiff, class action \nor not.\u201d  TransUnion LLC v. Ramirez, 594 U.S. 413, \n431 (2021) (citation omitted).  It should now clarify that \n\u201cno class may be certified that contains members lack-\ning Article III standing.\u201d  E.g., Denney v. Deutsche Bank \nAG, 443 F.3d 253, 264 (2d Cir. 2006).  Because stand-\ning \u201cis not dispensed in gross,\u201d plaintiffs must show \nan Article III basis for \u201ceach claim\u201d in the case, Daim-\nlerChrysler Corp. v. Cuno, 547 U.S. 332, 352-353 (2006) \n(citation omitted)\u2014including claims of absent class \nmembers brought into the action through a certification \n\n4 \n \norder.  Any other view would allow a procedural rule \nto subvert Article III and permit federal courts to ex-\nercise purely \u201c\u2018hypothetical jurisdiction\u2019\u201d over the \nclaims of people who suffered no injury in fact.  Steel \nCo. v. Citizens for a Better Environment, 523 U.S. 83, \n101 (1998). \nB.  It\u2019s not enough to ensure, at class certification, \nthat the class is defined to include only injured mem-\nbers.  To recover, the named plaintiff ultimately will \nhave to be able to prove, by final judgment, that each \nmember of a Rule 23(b)(3) class in fact has Article III \nstanding.  TransUnion, 594 U.S. at 431.  And that in \nturn raises serious questions, at class certification, \nabout whether the plaintiff can show that \u201cquestions \nof law or fact common to class members predominate \nover any questions affecting only individual mem-\nbers.\u201d  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3).  That especially \u201cde-\nmanding\u201d predominance requirement is often what \nprecludes certification.  Comcast Corp. v. Behrend, \n569 U.S. 27, 34 (2013). \nThe Ninth Circuit\u2019s approach sidesteps those is-\nsues.  In its view, everything comes down to numbers:  \nIt\u2019s no bother if a class includes more than a \u201cde mini-\nmis\u201d number of uninjured members, so long as that \nnumber doesn\u2019t become \u201cgreat\u201d (whatever that means).  \nOlean, 31 F.4th at 669 & n.14 (citation omitted).  But \nwhat matters for Rule 23(b)(3) isn\u2019t the number of un-\ninjured class members, but whether it is possible to \n\u201c\u2018segregate the uninjured from the truly injured\u2019\u201d\u2014\nand if that\u2019s going to require \u201cfull-blown, individual \ntrials,\u201d then no class proceeding should go forward.  In \nre Rail Freight Fuel Surcharge Antitrust Litigation, \n934 F.3d 619, 625 (D.C. Cir. 2019) (citation omitted).  \nUnless plaintiffs offer a compelling plan to resolve the \nquestion of Article III standing on a classwide basis, \n\n5 \n \nthey should not be permitted to invoke the exception \nof class litigation, with all the pressures and constitu-\ntional concerns it raises. \nARGUMENT \nI. \nCertifying classes with uninjured members \ncreates immense settlement pressure and \nthreatens innovation in the tech industry. \nThis Court has long recognized that \u201ccertification \nof a large class may so increase the defendant\u2019s poten-\ntial damages liability and litigation costs that he may \nfind it economically prudent to settle and to abandon \na meritorious defense.\u201d  Microsoft Corp. v. Baker, 582 \nU.S. 23, 29 (2017) (brackets omitted) (quoting Coopers \n& Lybrand v. Livesay, 437 U.S. 463, 476 (1978)).  Per-\nmitting plaintiffs to swell the ranks of their proposed \nclasses with members who suffered no injury, and to \nseek statutory penalties and punitive damages on be-\nhalf of such uninjured people, ratchets up that settle-\nment pressure to crushing levels.  Nowhere are those \neffects more gravely felt than in the tech industry, \nwhere digital platforms have led to stunning growth\u2014\nbut where, given the expanse of the platforms and the \nvolume of e-commerce, defendants\u2019 potential exposure \nquickly becomes astronomical. \nA. Tech companies are all-too tempting \ntargets for oversized class actions. \nThe American story can be told through the lens of \ntechnological innovation.  And over the last decade, a \nrevolutionary advance in \u201conline structures that ena-\nble a wide range of human activities\u201d has produced \n\u201cradical changes in how we work, socialize, create value \nin the economy, and compete for the resulting profits.\u201d  \nKenney & Zysman, The Rise of the Platform Economy, \nIssues in Science & Technology (Spring 2016), \n\n6 \n \nhttps://tinyurl.com/mr3ss3mz.  Tech companies in-\ncreasingly offer online platforms where millions of peo-\nple communicate and do business.  As those platforms \nhave grown, so too have their usefulness:  \u201cThey benefit \nfrom the network effect, so providing greater value\u201d the \nmore users take part.  Colback, The Rise of the Plat-\nform Economy, Financial Times (Mar. 13, 2023), \nhttps://tinyurl.com/5xryrkna.   \n\u201cDigital transformation is now affecting every \nbusiness sector,\u201d \u201cevery industry,\u201d and \u201cevery aspect \nof our life.\u201d  Minevich, 20 Leading Social Impact Plat-\nforms Making a Difference with Digital Potential, \nForbes (Aug. 3, 2021), https://tinyurl.com/mvxuapjh.  \nThe companies offering digital platforms for people to \nmeet, trade, and work range from tiny startups to some \nof the world\u2019s largest companies.  And the platforms, \nthrough their network effects, offer new opportunities \nfor innovation each year.  E.g., Persistence Market Re-\nsearch, Digital Experience Platform Market to Hit USD \n19.3 Billion by 2030 Due to Digital Transformation In-\nitiatives and E-commerce Growth, Yahoo! Finance \n(Jan. 11, 2024), https://tinyurl.com/mv9xun3h.  \nThe sheer reach of these digital platforms is un-\nprecedented.  For instance, Facebook, YouTube, Insta-\ngram, and WhatsApp each have more than 2 billion ac-\ntive users each month.  Most Popular Social Networks \nWorldwide as of April 2024, Statista, https://ti-\nnyurl.com/2s3jmdzy (visited Mar. 10, 2025).  Over 90% \nof Americans now own a smartphone and thus take ad-\nvantage of an array of mobile apps and platforms.  Mo-\nbile Fact Sheet, Pew Research Center (Nov. 13, 2024), \nhttps://tinyurl.com/3b4p5x55.  Nearly 95% of compa-\nnies worldwide now rely on cloud computing.  How \nMany Companies Use Cloud Computing in 2024?, Edge \nDelta (May 17, 2024), https://tinyurl.com/5chzmzu8.  \n\n7 \n \nAnd so on.  The more people and businesses turn to \ndigital platforms, the more value they generate; by \n2028, the digital economy is slated to reach $16.5 tril-\nlion.  Ang, Global Digital Economy Will Hit US$16.5 \nTrillion by 2028, Business Times (Aug. 19, 2024), \nhttps://tinyurl.com/237earzc.  \nDigital platforms are also a great equalizer, offer-\ning even small startups the chance to put their digital \nproducts or services in front of millions of potential \ncustomers in a span of weeks.  Most of the digital econ-\nomy is driven not by a few massive companies, but by \nsmaller apps and websites.  For example, while Insta-\ngram may have more than 2 billion active users each \nmonth, Instagram\u2019s nearly 640 million app downloads \nin 2024 is dwarfed by the nearly 110 billion downloads \nacross all consumer mobile apps that year, with more \nthan 85% of consumer mobile app revenue coming \nfrom mobile apps outside the largest ten.  Perez, App \nDownloads Decline 2.3% in 2024, but Consumer \nSpending Grows to $127B, TechCrunch (Dec. 18, \n2024), https://tinyurl.com/4bup4nr3. \nFor plaintiffs interested in bringing Rule 23(b)(3) \ndamages class actions, the size of even nascent digital \nplatforms and the potential for easy recovery via an \ninflated class offer an irresistible opportunity.  Often \nwith little more than vague allegations about a tech \ncompany\u2019s practices or a platform\u2019s policies, plaintiffs \ncan quickly arrive at proposed classes numbering well \ninto the millions.  The exposure associated with those \nproposed classes can be staggering, too.  As uninjured \nmembers increase the estimated class size, so in-\ncreases the money being demanded and the starting \npoint for any settlement negotiations\u2014especially \nwhere the plaintiffs argue that every member of an \nenormous class, even those who weren\u2019t actually in-\n\n8 \n \njured by the challenged practice, should be entitled to \nstatutory penalties and punitive damages.  See, e.g., \nTransUnion LLC v. Ramirez, 594 U.S. 413, 421-422 \n(2021) (involving verdict that stacked statutory and \npunitive damages for uninjured class members).  Plus, \ngiven the complexity and scale of digital platforms, it \ncan often be difficult to determine which particular \nusers, if any, were affected by a challenged practice.  \nSo plaintiffs have every incentive to load up their clas-\nses with everyone who may have encountered the \nplatform or viewed products or services online, and to \nask the court to disregard the problem of uninjured \nmembers\u2014or at least kick the injury can down the \nroad to some later stage of the proceedings.   \nThese sorts of overinflated class actions have seri-\nous, harmful consequences.  Even an erroneous class-\ncertification order \u201cmay force a defendant to settle ra-\nther than run the risk of potentially ruinous liability.\u201d  \nBaker, 582 U.S. at 41-42 (ellipsis omitted) (quoting \nFed. R. Civ. P. 23(f) advisory committee\u2019s note to 1998 \namendment).  That\u2019s in part because the prospect of \nwinning at trial or reversing class certification in an \neventual appeal doesn\u2019t erase the \u201cextensive discovery \nand the potential for uncertainty and disruption\u201d that \nforce class-action defendants to settle in the first \nplace.  Stoneridge Investment Partners, LLC v. Scien-\ntific-Atlanta, Inc., 552 U.S. 148, 163 (2008).  Such \u201c\u2018in \nterrorem\u2019 settlements\u201d are an open secret by now.  \nAT&T Mobility LLC v. Concepcion, 563 U.S. 333, 350 \n(2011); see Pet. Br. 32-33.  The unprecedented expanse \nof class actions against tech companies makes those \npressures all but unbearable.   \nIf left unchecked, these sorts of sweeping class ac-\ntions will harm innovation.  The digital economy has \nbeen so successful, and so beneficial to consumers, \n\n9 \n \nprecisely because tech companies have engineered \nways to reduce barriers to entry and to facilitate com-\nmunication and e-commerce on a massive scale.  But \nif plaintiffs are permitted to bring class actions, secure \nclass certification, and make demands based on every \nuser of those platforms\u2014no matter whether the users \nwere actually injured by the challenged conduct\u2014\nthen companies will be pressured to restrict usage of \nthe platforms or else face potentially ruinous liability.  \nThat would have untold consequences for the econ-\nomy, for society, for speech, and more.  \nThose consequences wouldn\u2019t be confined to mas-\nsive companies with the coffers to ward them off.  In \nfact, the harmful effects of an overly permissive ap-\nproach to classes with uninjured members could be \nfelt most acutely among the highly innovative small \nand midsize businesses and startups that have lim-\nited resources, but that nonetheless are pioneering \ntechnological breakthroughs that will define tomor-\nrow\u2019s tech industry.  Those companies may be able, \nthanks to low barriers to entry in the modern digital \neconomy, to reach millions of consumers at once.  But \nthey wouldn\u2019t have the resources to face down an ex-\ntortionate class action loaded with people who suf-\nfered no injury.  For those companies, the only choice \nwould be to settle early or close up shop.  In either \ncase, looking the other way while plaintiffs flout Arti-\ncle III and funnel the claims of uninjured people into \nfederal court leaves those companies less likely to \nbring their innovations to market, threatening the \nprogress and prosperity that the digital economy \npromises.  \n\n10 \n \nB. The Ninth Circuit\u2019s rule has greenlit  \ninflated \nclass \nactions \nagainst \ntech \ncompanies. \nThe Ninth Circuit has disregarded the coercive ef-\nfects of overinflated classes and instead adopted a per-\nmissive approach to assessing Article III standing at \nclass certification.  It holds that district courts can \noverlook \u201cthe possible presence of uninjured class \nmembers,\u201d so long as the number is not too \u201c\u2018great.\u2019\u201d  \nOlean Wholesale Grocery Cooperative, Inc. v. Bumble \nBee Foods LLC, 31 F.4th 651, 669 n.14 (9th Cir. 2022) \n(en banc) (citation omitted).  In Olean, for example, \nthe Ninth Circuit held that the district court could de-\nfer resolving all issues of class member standing until \ntrial even though expert evidence suggested that 28% \nof class members suffered no injury.  Id. at 680-681; \nid. at 686 (Lee, J., dissenting). \nThe Ninth Circuit\u2019s hands-off approach to Arti-\ncle III standing at class certification has unleashed \noversized class actions\u2014especially against tech com-\npanies.  The facts of this case illustrate the concerns \nwith allowing named plaintiffs to shoot for the moon \nin their class definitions.  Pet. Br. 43-44.  But other \ncases shine an even harsher light on the inconsistency \nof the Ninth Circuit\u2019s rule with Article III\u2019s limit on \nthe cases and controversies fit for federal court. \nA prime example is what happened after this \nCourt\u2019s decision in Apple Inc. v. Pepper, 587 U.S. 273 \n(2019).  There, this Court held that antitrust claims \ncould go forward on the theory that the plaintiffs \n\u201cpa[id] [an] alleged overcharge directly to Apple\u201d \nwhen they bought apps in the App Store.  Id. at 281.  \nThe plaintiffs on remand sought to certify a class of \nanyone in the United States who paid Apple more than \n$10 for an app or in-app purchase, which amounted to \n\n11 \n \naround 125 million App Store accounts.  In re Apple \niPhone Antitrust Litigation, No. 4:11-cv-6714, Dkt. 789 \nat 2 (N.D. Cal. Feb. 2, 2024).  The plaintiffs\u2019 own expert \nestimated that almost 8% of the proposed class (more \nthan 10 million accounts) would not have paid any \novercharge\u2014the critical element from this Court\u2019s de-\ncision.  Id. at 25.  The district court even professed its \n\u201cconcer[n]\u201d about the number of \u201cuninjured ac-\ncounts\u201d\u2014but using the 28% figure from Olean as a \nbenchmark, it accepted the plaintiffs\u2019 \u201csurmise\u201d that \nthey\u2019d later be able to identify uninjured class mem-\nbers by refining their model and certified the class any-\nway.  Id. at 25-26.  That certify-first, analyze-standing-\nlater approach resulted in a massively oversized class \naction in which the district court took jurisdiction over \nthe claims of millions of class members who were con-\ncededly uninjured. \nThere was more of the same in Rodriguez v. Google \nLLC, 2024 WL 38302 (N.D. Cal. Jan. 3, 2024).  The \nplaintiffs claimed that Google improperly collected \ndata from users who had opted out of certain settings.  \nId. at *1.  In response, Google argued that \u201cthe \u2018vast \nmajority\u2019 of class members\u2019 data\u201d was collected only for \nroutine record-keeping\u2014not to be monetized for ad rev-\nenues.  Id. at *6 (citation omitted).  The class members \ncouldn\u2019t prove an injury from mere data collection \nwithout something more like monetization, ibid., just \nas the class members in TransUnion couldn\u2019t rely on \nmere inaccuracies in the defendant\u2019s records for stand-\ning absent disclosure to a third party, 594 U.S. at 437.  \nYet the district court in Rodriguez chose to defer ad-\ndressing that issue until later in the case and certified \na class of \u201c\u2018100 million privacy plaintiffs\u2019\u201d seeking more \nthan half a billion dollars.  2024 WL 38302, at *6; see \nid. at *11.  If a district court has permitted a massively \ninflated class to burst through the class-certification \n\n12 \n \ngate, the opportunity to knock out the vast majority of \nthe class under Article III at an eventual class trial is \ncold comfort even when the defendant has ample re-\nsources, let alone when a startup faces potential bet-\nthe-company liability. \nEven before Olean, district courts in the Ninth \nCircuit had often turned a blind eye to uninjured class \nmembers at certification.  The plaintiffs in one case, \nfor instance, sought to certify a class of 250 million \npeople seeking around $5 billion in damages against \nQualcomm.  In re Qualcomm Antitrust Litigation, 328 \nF.R.D. 280, 294, 304 (N.D. Cal. 2018).  Qualcomm ar-\ngued that the class \u201cinclude[d] a large number of \nmembers\u201d who could not have suffered any injury and \npointed out that the plaintiffs had carved out buyers \nof iPhones from their expert report on the purported \novercharge.  Id. at 310-311.  But the district court ef-\nfectively flipped the burden, certifying the class on the \ntheory that Qualcomm had not \u201cdefinitively\u201d estab-\nlished that those class members lacked an injury suf-\nficient to give them standing.  Id. at 311.  Although \nthe Ninth Circuit ultimately vacated class certifica-\ntion on other grounds, Stromberg v. Qualcomm Inc., \n14 F.4th 1059, 1067 (9th Cir. 2021), the district court\u2019s \norder illustrates how a lenient approach to standing \nat class certification permits extreme aggregation of \ndamages claims\u2014especially against tech companies, \nfor which scale of platform, depth of pocket, and value \ncreated by cutting-edge innovation provide an all-too-\nenticing target. \nII. The \nNinth \nCircuit\u2019s \nrule \nundermines \nbedrock standing requirements. \nArticle III establishes the foundations of, and im-\nposes the limits on, federal judicial power.  And at \nevery stage, \u201c[t]he party invoking federal jurisdiction \n\n13 \n \nbears the burden of establishing\u201d standing under the \nburdens applicable to \u201csuccessive stages of the litiga-\ntion.\u201d  Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, \n561 (1992).  That ironclad rule has consequences for \nclass certification:  The named plaintiff must make a \nthreshold showing before certification that the district \ncourt can exercise jurisdiction over the claims of all \nabsent class members.  And even then, the plaintiff \nalso must demonstrate his ultimate ability to prove \nstanding for all the claims without having individual-\nized issues overwhelm a potential class trial.  The \nNinth Circuit wrongly rejects the first requirement \nand dilutes the second. \nA. The named plaintiff must define the class \nwithin Article III\u2019s limits. \nThe Constitution limits the \u201cjudicial Power\u201d to \n\u201cCases\u201d and \u201cControversies.\u201d  Art. III, \u00a7 2.  The \u201cirre-\nducible constitutional minimum\u201d for any case or con-\ntroversy comprises the three elements of standing, \neach of which the plaintiff must establish:  (1) an in-\njury in fact that is (2) fairly traceable to the defend-\nant\u2019s conduct and (3) likely to be redressed by the ex-\nercise of federal judicial power.  Defenders of Wildlife, \n504 U.S. at 560-561.  Together, the elements of stand-\ning confine federal courts to resolving \u201creal con-\ntrovers[ies] with real impact on real persons.\u201d  \nTransUnion, 594 U.S. at 424 (citation omitted).  And \nno one can seek relief in federal court unless he can \n\u201csufficiently answer the question:  \u2018What\u2019s it to you?\u2019\u201d  \nId. at 423 (citation omitted).   \nArticle III\u2019s most vital requirement isn\u2019t limited to \nthe end of the case.  Quite the opposite:  Any plaintiff \nseeking any form of relief must demonstrate Arti-\ncle III standing when entering the case.  In Town of \nChester v. Laroe Estates, Inc., 581 U.S. 433 (2017), for \n\n14 \n \nexample, the Second Circuit sidestepped the \u201cthresh-\nold issue\u201d of Article III standing when allowing an in-\ntervenor to enter the case.  Id. at 435.  This Court va-\ncated, stressing that the requirements of Article III \napply \u201cwhether [a] litigant joins the lawsuit as a plain-\ntiff, a coplaintiff, or an intervenor of right.\u201d  Id. at 439.  \nWhen a person seeks damages, he \u201cmust establish \n[his] own Article III standing in order to intervene.\u201d  \nId. at 442 (emphasis added).  That rule has deep roots \nin Article III:  A court that allowed intervention while \npromising to address standing down the road would \nbe assuming a form of \u201c\u2018hypothetical jurisdiction\u2019\u201d \nthat has always exceeded federal courts\u2019 proper role \nunder the Constitution.  Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Bet-\nter Environment, 523 U.S. 83, 101 (1998). \nThose principles don\u2019t fall by the wayside in class \nactions.  True, a class action is \u201can exception\u201d of \nsorts\u2014not to Article III, but \u201cto the usual rule that lit-\nigation is conducted by and on behalf of the individual \nnamed parties only.\u201d  Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, \n564 U.S. 338, 348 (2011) (citation omitted).  The named \nplaintiff in a class action instead conducts the litiga-\ntion on behalf of himself and the absent class mem-\nbers.  See id. at 348-349.  This claim-aggregating pro-\ncedure functions as a sort of \u201ctraditional joinder\u201d that \n\u201cenables a federal court to adjudicate claims of multi-\nple parties at once,\u201d Shady Grove Orthopedic Associ-\nates, P.A. v. Allstate Insurance Co., 559 U.S. 393, 408 \n(2010) (plurality opinion); see Sprint Communications \nCo. v. APCC Services, Inc., 554 U.S. 269, 291 (2008), \neven though the absent class members are not full-\nfledged parties in the same way a named plaintiff or \nintervenor would be, see Devlin v. Scardelletti, 536 \nU.S. 1, 9-10 (2002). \n\n15 \n \nBecause a class action is simply a device for aggre-\ngating claims of unnamed parties, it cannot be used to \ncircumvent constitutional constraints.  That a case is \nbrought as a class action \u201cadds nothing to the question \nof standing.\u201d  Lewis v. Casey, 518 U.S. 343, 357 (1996) \n(citation omitted).  In fact, this Court has warned that, \nin this \u201cera\u201d of \u201cclass actions,\u201d \u201ccourts must be more \ncareful to insist on the formal rules of standing, not \nless so.\u201d  Arizona Christian School Tuition Organiza-\ntion v. Winn, 563 U.S. 125, 146 (2011).  TransUnion \nleft no doubt on that score:  \u201cArticle III does not give \nfederal courts the power to order relief to any unin-\njured plaintiff, class action or not.\u201d  594 U.S. at 431 \n(citation omitted).  The upshot is that the named \nplaintiff must establish standing for \u201ceach claim\u201d that \nhe seeks to aggregate.  DaimlerChrysler Corp. v. Cuno, \n547 U.S. 332, 352 (2006).  After all, \u201cstanding is not \ndispensed in gross,\u201d meaning that a constitutional ba-\nsis must undergird a federal court\u2019s exercise of judicial \npower over each claim in the class.  TransUnion, 594 \nU.S. at 431. \nThis Court therefore should hold that, under \nRule 23(b)(3), \u201cno class may be certified that contains \nmembers lacking Article III standing.\u201d  Denney v. \nDeutsche Bank AG, 443 F.3d 253, 264 (2d Cir. 2006); \nsee, e.g., Halvorson v. Auto-Owners Insurance Co., 718 \nF.3d 773, 778 (8th Cir. 2013) (\u201cIn order for a class to \nbe certified, each member must have standing and \nshow an injury in fact that is traceable to the defend-\nant and likely to be redressed in a favorable deci-\nsion.\u201d); see also Pet. Br. 25.  Here, as with other con-\nstitutionally grounded procedures, \u201c\u2018crisp rules with \nsharp corners\u2019 are preferable to a round-about doc-\ntrine of opaque standards.\u201d  Taylor v. Sturgell, 553 \nU.S. 880, 901 (2008) (citation omitted).   \n\n16 \n \nCertifying classes containing uninjured members \non the promise to weed them out later defies the prin-\nciple that the exercise of judicial power \u201cis legitimate \nonly in the last resort, and as a necessity in the deter-\nmination of real, earnest and vital controversy.\u201d  Val-\nley Forge Christian College v. Americans United for \nSeparation of Church & State, Inc., 454 U.S. 464, 471 \n(1982) (quoting Chicago & Grand Trunk Railway Co. \nv. Wellman, 143 U.S. 339, 345 (1892)); see Pet. Br. 30.  \nYet the Ninth Circuit has allowed district courts to \ncast their jurisdiction far and wide as a first resort be-\nfore resolving the \u201cthreshold issue\u201d of standing.  Town \nof Chester, 581 U.S. at 435; see pp. 10-12, supra. \nKicking the Article III can down the road also has \nintolerable consequences for defendants.  Pet. Br. 32-\n34.  Any settlement discussions will be framed by the \n\u201cpotential damages liability\u201d for the entire certified \nclass.  Coopers & Lybrand, 437 U.S. at 476; see p. 8, \nsupra.  The certification of \u201cgrossly oversized classes\u201d \nthus allows plaintiffs \u201cto extract a settlement, even if \nthe merits of their claims are questionable.\u201d  Olean, \n31 F.4th at 692 (Lee, J., dissenting).  For defendants \nfacing the Hobson\u2019s choice to settle or risk ruinous li-\nability, the abstract prospect of late-stage analysis of \neach class member\u2019s standing is \u201ca phantom solution.\u201d  \nId. at 691.  The federal judiciary should be the last to \nsign off on mass violations of Article III that will pre-\ndictably coerce excessive settlements. \nB. The named plaintiff must establish an \nability to prove every class member\u2019s \nstanding without individualized issues \npredominating. \nLimiting the class definition to injured class mem-\nbers is necessary but not sufficient to keep a case \nwithin the bounds of Article III.  The named plaintiff \n\n17 \n \nalso must ultimately prove, by final judgment, that \neach member of a damages class has standing.  \nTransUnion, 594 U.S. at 431.  That showing has the \npotential to lead to endless mini-trials over absent \nclass members\u2019 standing\u2014and that concern cannot be \nswept under the rug when deciding whether to certify \na class.  \nRule 23(b)(3) makes clear that district courts can-\nnot ignore individualized standing questions at class \ncertification.  Any attempt to certify a damages class \ntriggers an additional \u201csafeguar[d]\u201d:  the \u201cdemanding\u201d \npredominance requirement.  Comcast Corp. v. Beh-\nrend, 569 U.S. 27, 34 (2013).  Class certification is im-\nproper unless \u201cthe questions of law or fact common to \nclass members predominate over any questions affect-\ning only individual members.\u201d  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3).  \nThis inquiry \u201cbegins, of course, with the elements of \nthe underlying cause of action.\u201d  Erica P. John Fund, \nInc. v. Halliburton Co., 563 U.S. 804, 809-810 (2011).  \nAnd standing is \u201can indispensable part of the plain-\ntiff\u2019s case\u201d that, again, \u201cmust be supported in the \nsame way as any other matter on which the plaintiff \nbears the burden of proof\u201d\u2014that is, \u201cwith the manner \nand degree of evidence required at the successive \nstages of the litigation.\u201d  Defenders of Wildlife, 504 \nU.S. at 561. \nPutting two and two together:  The plaintiff must \nshow that common questions will predominate over \nany Article III standing issues \u201caffecting only individ-\nual members.\u201d  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3).  To its credit, \nthe Ninth Circuit has recognized that the predomi-\nnance requirement applies to standing.  Olean, 31 \nF.4th at 668 n.12.  But the Ninth Circuit pays lip ser-\nvice to this constraint.  In its view, a certification or-\nder survives its version of predominance unless the \n\n18 \n \nclass is \u201cdefined so broadly as to include a great num-\nber of members\u201d who were uninjured.  Id. at 669 n.14 \n(emphasis added; citation omitted).  That rule could \nalmost have been reverse-engineered in a lab to cer-\ntify class actions despite serious standing issues. \nThe Ninth Circuit has sought to justify its \u201cgreat \nnumber\u201d standard by portraying its competitor as the \n\u201cde minimis\u201d test.  Olean, 31 F.4th at 669.  The insin-\nuation is that courts must adopt an arbitrary numer-\nical or percentage cutoff for uninjured class members, \nand the debate is simply over which threshold suf-\nfices.  But that\u2019s a false choice.  The \u201cde minimis\u201d cases \nrest less on the absolute number or percentage of un-\ninjured class members than on the plaintiff\u2019s antici-\npated ability to \u201c\u2018segregate the uninjured from the \ntruly injured\u2019\u201d without \u201cfull-blown, individual trials.\u201d  \nIn re Rail Freight Fuel Surcharge Antitrust Litigation, \n934 F.3d 619, 625 (D.C. Cir. 2019) (citation omitted); \nsee In re Asacol Antitrust Litigation, 907 F.3d 42, 53-\n54 (1st Cir. 2018). \nThe Ninth Circuit\u2019s focus on whether a great or \nsmall number of class members likely suffered an in-\njury thus misses the point.  Uninjured class members \naren\u2019t supposed to be participating in the case, via the \nclass-action mechanism or otherwise, at all.  So if the \ndefendant or the court would be forced to go to great \nlengths to weed them out one by one, that\u2019s a sign that \nthings have already taken a wrong turn at class certi-\nfication.  And even when the number or percentage of \nuninjured class members may be small, the process of \nlocating them can overwhelm the case with individu-\nalized inquiries.  The task of finding all the needles in \nthe haystack doesn\u2019t get easier when there are fewer \nneedles.  Instead, it gets easier when there\u2019s less hay \nto sift through, or when a person steps forward with a \n\n19 \n \nmanageable plan for accurately finding every last nee-\ndle.  Yet the Ninth Circuit errs in favor of both larger \nclasses and weaker predominance review, turning a \ncheck on individualized issues into a permission slip \nto stuff the class full of uninjured members who \nshouldn\u2019t be in federal court in the first place. \nWere there any doubt, principles of constitutional \navoidance would foreclose the Ninth Circuit\u2019s lax \ntreatment of standing concerns under the predomi-\nnance test.  This Court has long explained that \u201cseri-\nous constitutional concerns\u201d \u201ccounsel against adven-\nturous application[s]\u201d of Rule 23.  Ortiz v. Fibreboard \nCorp., 527 U.S. 815, 845 (1999).  The Court also has \nbeen \u201cmindful that [the Rule\u2019s] requirements must be \ninterpreted in keeping with Article III constraints.\u201d  \nId. at 831 (brackets in original) (quoting Amchem \nProducts, Inc. v. Windsor, 521 U.S. 591, 612-613 \n(1997)); see Fed. R. Civ. P. 82 (\u201cThese rules do not ex-\ntend  * * *  the jurisdiction of the district courts.\u201d); see \nalso Pet. Br. 21.  Unless the plaintiff can demonstrate \na concrete plan to prove every absent class member\u2019s \nstanding in a manageable class proceeding, courts \nshould deny class certification\u2014even if the standing \nconcerns raised by the defendant do not affect a \u201cgreat \nnumber\u201d of class members.  Olean, 31 F.4th at 669 \nn.14.  Article III shouldn\u2019t be an afterthought\u2014it\u2019s an \nindispensable feature of our \u201cseparation of powers.\u201d  \nTransUnion, 594 U.S. at 422 (citation omitted). \nThe predominance requirement thus should fore-\nclose class certification in cases, like this one, in which \nthe plaintiffs allege that a legal violation occurred \nwhen class members were \u201cexposed\u201d to a device that \nallegedly violated some law.  Pet. App. 35a.  Because \n\u201can injury in law is not an injury in fact,\u201d the plaintiff \nmust establish that each class member suffered some \n\n20 \n \nreal-world harm beyond proximity to the defendant\u2019s \ndevice.  TransUnion, 594 U.S. at 427.  But often the \nonly way to know whether a bare legal violation \ncaused some harm is to put on individualized testi-\nmony\u2014here, for example, whether class members \ntried or even wanted to use the allegedly non-ADA-\ncompliant kiosks.  See Pet. Br. 22-23.  Because re-\nspondents haven\u2019t identified any common evidence \nthat could prove such an injury in fact on a classwide \nbasis, the Ninth Circuit erred in holding that they sat-\nisfied the predominance requirement.  See Comcast, \n569 U.S. at 34. \nCONCLUSION \nThe judgment should be reversed for either or \nboth of the reasons that the class definition sweeps in \nuninjured class members and individualized standing \nquestions will predominate over common issues. \nRespectfully submitted. \n \nPRERAK SHAH \nGIBSON, DUNN & CRUTCHER LLP \n811 Main Street #3000 \nHouston, TX  77002 \n \nDREW HUDSON \nTECHNET \n1420 New York Avenue, N.W. \nSuite 825 \nWashington, DC  20005 \n \nTHEODORE J.

          "task_beliefs": "This observation, being a synthesis of my internal state, does not introduce new substantive information about the case itself. Therefore, my task-level beliefs remain stable, but their structure is confirmed and my next steps are clarified.\n\n*   **Petitioner's Arguments & Strategy (Stable):** LabCorp's core argument remains that the presence of uninjured members in a proposed class violates both Article III standing requirements and Rule 23's predominance and commonality requirements, making class certification improper. This position is supported by their interpretation of *TransUnion v. Ramirez*.\n*   **Respondent's Arguments & Strategy (Stable):** The respondents' counter-arguments, which I have now fully integrated, provide the Court with several \"off-ramps\" to deny certiorari. These are: 1) the question isn't presented because the injury is the denial of equal access to the kiosk service, which all class members suffered; 2) LabCorp waived the Article III argument for the nationwide class; and 3) the circuit split alleged by LabCorp is illusory.\n*   **Key Precedents & Legal Framework (Stable):** My legal map remains a dialectic. On one side, *TransUnion*, *Wal-Mart*, and *Comcast* support a strict view of standing and class composition. On the other, cases like *Kohen*, *Olean Wholesale*, and *Tyson Foods* support a more flexible approach where uninjured members can be managed post-certification, framing it as a Rule 23 issue rather than a threshold Article III bar.\n*   **Central Uncertainty (Refined):** The primary uncertainty is no longer *what* the arguments are, but *how* the Supreme Court will weigh them. Specifically, will the Court be more compelled by the petitioner's clean legal question about Article III, or will it be persuaded by the respondent's arguments that this case is a poor vehicle for resolving that question? My current model suggests the \"poor vehicle\" and \"no real split\" arguments are potent grounds for a cert denial. The next crucial piece of information is to gauge the case's perceived importance to outside parties, which will signal whether the Court might overlook potential vehicle problems to address a pressing legal issue.\n*   **Advocacy Signal (Stable):** The matchup between Noel Francisco (Jones Day) for the petitioner and Nicolas Sansone (Public Citizen) for the respondent continues to signal a high-quality, serious dispute, ensuring the Justices have top-tier briefing on both sides.",
          "design_beliefs": "This observation provides powerful validation for my existing design-level beliefs. The `THINK` action itself is a direct output of my meta-heuristics in action, confirming that my strategic framework is not only sound but is actively guiding my research process in a logical, efficient manner.\n\n*   **Source Value Confirmation (Reinforced):** The value of primary legal documents (Petition, Brief in Opposition) is re-confirmed as the bedrock of my analysis. My current state of knowledge is built almost entirely upon them.\n*   **Heuristic - \"Deconstruct the Cert-Stage Dialectic\" (Validated):** My internal reasoning demonstrates the successful application of this heuristic. I have moved beyond analyzing the petition in isolation and am now focused on the interplay between the two core briefs, which is the central dynamic at the cert stage.\n*   **Heuristic - \"Follow the Advocate\" (Stable):** The significance of the advocate matchup (Jones Day vs. Public Citizen) as a signal of a well-briefed, serious case is a stable part of my model.\n*   **Meta-Heuristic - \"Reflective Gap Analysis\" (Validated & Applied):** This observation is a direct result of applying this meta-heuristic. I have paused, synthesized my current knowledge, identified the remaining uncertainty (gauging the case's perceived importance), and formulated a plan to address it. This confirms the value of periodically stepping back to ensure a coherent and deliberate research strategy, preventing aimless information gathering.\n*   **Meta-Heuristic - \"Identify the Off-Ramps\" (Validated & Applied):** My internal reasoning explicitly references the \"off-ramps\" (waiver, poor vehicle, no split) provided by the respondent's brief. This shows the heuristic has been successfully integrated into my analytical workflow and is now a key lens through which I evaluate the probability of a cert grant.\n*   **Information Gathering Plan (Validated & Executed):** The observation confirms my adherence to the sequential plan (1. Petition -> 2. Opposition Brief -> 3. Amicus Briefs -> 4. Precedent Analysis). The reasoning articulated in the `THINK` action provides a clear justification for the next step: seeking amicus briefs. This demonstrates a successful transition from reactive learning (acquiring the opposition brief to fill a gap) to proactive, model-driven inquiry (seeking amicus briefs to test a specific hypothesis about the case's perceived importance). My confidence in this procedural heuristic is very high."

          "task_beliefs": "*   **Petitioner's Arguments & Strategy (Reinforced & Expanded):** LabCorp's core argument\u2014that Article III and Rule 23 prohibit certifying a class with uninjured members\u2014is now significantly bolstered by the amicus brief from TechNet. This brief adds a powerful policy argument, framing the issue as a direct threat to the \"innovation economy.\" It argues that the Ninth Circuit's permissive standard creates \"immense settlement pressure\" (*in terrorem* settlements) that forces tech companies, from startups to established players, to settle meritless claims rather than risk \"potentially ruinous liability.\" This reframes the case from a dry procedural dispute to one with major economic consequences, an angle designed to capture the Court's attention.\n*   **Respondent's Arguments & Strategy (Stable, but Context Changed):** The respondents' \"off-ramp\" arguments (waiver, poor vehicle, illusory circuit split) remain their primary defense against certiorari. However, the weight and influence of these arguments are now counterbalanced by the significant external interest shown by the TechNet amicus brief. The stronger the signal that this is a recurring issue of national economic importance, the less likely the Court is to be dissuaded by case-specific vehicle problems.\n*   **Key Precedents & Legal Framework (Reinforced):** The legal landscape remains a contest between the strict standing requirements articulated in *TransUnion LLC v. Ramirez* and the more flexible approach to class composition from cases like *Olean Wholesale*. The TechNet brief explicitly highlights this tension, arguing that the Ninth Circuit's rule in *Olean* (allowing certification so long as the number of uninjured members is not \"great\") is a direct affront to *TransUnion*'s holding that \"no class may be certified that contains members lacking Article III standing.\"\n*   **Amicus Signal (New & Significant):** The appearance of an amicus brief from TechNet, a major technology industry association, is a critical new signal. It accomplishes two things:\n    1.  **Raises the Stakes:** It demonstrates that a significant sector of the U.S. economy believes the legal question presented is of vital importance, moving it beyond the interests of the immediate parties.\n    2.  **Amplifies the Advocacy:** The brief is filed by Theodore Boutrous of Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher, another elite Supreme Court advocate. The combination of Noel Francisco for the petitioner and Ted Boutrous for a major amicus creates a formidable advocacy lineup, signaling to the Justices that this is a high-priority issue for the business community that will be exceptionally well-briefed.\n*   **Central Uncertainty (Shifted):** My central uncertainty has shifted. Previously, it was whether the Court would perceive the case as important enough to grant cert despite the respondents' \"poor vehicle\" arguments. The TechNet brief provides strong evidence that it *is* perceived as important. The uncertainty now is *how much* the Court will weigh this demonstrated importance against the potential procedural defects. The probability of a cert grant has increased notably with this observation. The policy arguments about stifling innovation and the legal arguments about Article III's jurisdictional limits are potent and are aimed squarely at the Court's conservative majority.",
          "design_beliefs": "*   **Source Value Confirmation (Reinforced):** The supreme value of primary legal documents is confirmed again. This observation specifically highlights the unique utility of *amicus curiae* briefs at the cert stage. While the petition and opposition define the core legal dispute, amicus briefs are invaluable for gauging the \"real-world\" stakes, perceived importance, and broader policy implications of a case.\n*   **Heuristic - \"Deconstruct the Cert-Stage Dialectic\" (Refined):** This heuristic is not just about the back-and-forth between petitioner and respondent. It must be expanded to include the chorus of amici. The dialectic is a multi-party conversation where amici serve to amplify one side's arguments, introduce new policy dimensions (like the \"threat to innovation\" argument), and signal the breadth of a legal issue's impact.\n*   **Heuristic - \"Follow the Advocate\" (Powerfully Validated):** This observation is a textbook validation of this heuristic. The entrance of another top-tier Supreme Court advocate (Theodore Boutrous) on behalf of a major amicus is a five-alarm signal of a case's \"cert-worthiness.\" It indicates that sophisticated parties with significant resources believe the Court is likely to be interested and that the issue is worth a major investment in legal firepower.\n*   **Meta-Heuristic - \"Reflective Gap Analysis\" (Validated):** My previous self-correction and analysis were spot-on. I identified that the key missing variable was the case's perceived importance, and I correctly hypothesized that searching for amicus briefs was the most direct way to measure it. This successful loop (Identify Gap -> Formulate Plan -> Execute -> Gain Key Insight) validates the importance of periodically pausing to assess the state of knowledge and plan the next inquiry.\n*   **Meta-Heuristic - \"Identify the Off-Ramps\" (Updated with a Corollary):** While it's crucial to identify the \"off-ramps\" (reasons to deny cert) presented by the respondent, it is equally crucial to identify the \"on-ramps\" created by the petitioner and their amici. A strong amicus presence, especially from a major industry group raising economic alarms, serves as a powerful \"on-ramp,\" giving the Court a compelling reason to take a case it might otherwise pass over due to minor vehicle flaws.\n*   **Information Gathering Plan (Validated):** The sequential strategy of analyzing the Petition, then the Brief in Opposition, and then Amicus Briefs has proven to be highly effective and efficient. Each step builds logically on the last, moving from the core question, to the direct counterarguments, to the broader context and importance. My confidence in this procedural model for cert-stage analysis is now extremely high."

Tyson Foods, \nInc. v. Bouaphakeo, 577 U.S. 442, 461 (2016).  Nor do \nthey dispute that this question implicates billions of \ndollars, including legal fees and massive settlements.  \nBut Plaintiffs nonetheless implore this Court to stay \non the sidelines\u2014no doubt because this suit is the \ntextbook example of why the status quo must change. \nPlaintiffs offer no sound reason for this Court to do \nso.  Foremost, Plaintiffs disclaim that there is really a \nsplit here.  But the same split that prompted this \nCourt to grant review in Tyson Foods is the one at \nissue now.  And Plaintiffs do not even try to explain \nhow this divide among the circuits has resolved itself \nsince.  Nor could they.  As everyone else agrees\u2014from \nthe bench, to the academy\u2014it has only gotten worse.  \nPlaintiffs other points fare no better.  They insist \nthat their classes do not really include any uninjured \nmembers.  But in the next breath, they accept that a \nsignificant number of members have zero interest in \nusing the kiosks at issue.  That is dispositive under \nthis Court\u2019s cases: If someone has no interest in using \na service (and does not use that service), he has not \nsuffered a concrete injury from its alleged deficiencies. \nFinally, Plaintiffs contend there is nothing to worry \nabout, because there are plenty of tools for weeding \nout the uninjured after certification.  But that misses \nthe whole point: Certification is the ballgame; and if \nplaintiffs can swell classes with uninjured members, \nthe next (and final) stop is settlement.  It is time this \nCourt say whether federal law allows such a gambit. \n\n \n2 \n \n \nARGUMENT \nI. \nTHERE IS A SPLIT. \nEvery objective observer seems to agree on one \nthing in this otherwise unsettled area of law: The \ncircuits are deeply divided on the question presented. \nAs Judge Kayatta put it recently: The \u201ccircuits are \nsplit\u201d over \u201cthe presence of uninjured class members.\u201d  \nIn re Asacol Antitrust Litig., 907 F.3d 42, 46-47 (1st \nCir. 2018).  This \u201cdivergence\u201d is across some circuits \nthat \u201cfram[e] the issue of uninjured class members \nthrough the lens of Article III,\u201d and those that \u201cview[] \nthe issue of uninjured class members through the \nprism of Rule 23(b)(3) predominance\u201d\u2014following a \nspectrum of differing approaches, from strict to lax.  \nId. at 56-57. \nThe professors agree.  The \u201cquestion whether every \nclass member must demonstrate standing before a \ncourt certifies a class\u201d is \u201cunresolved\u201d and \u201chas \ngenerated differing approaches\u201d across the circuits.  1 \nWilliam B. Rubenstein, Newberg and Rubenstein on \nClass Actions \u00a7 2:3 (6th ed. 2024).  Indeed, not only are \nthe courts of appeals \u201cdivided on whether certification \nmust be denied where the proposed class includes \npersons who have suffered no injury,\u201d but they are \nalso \u201cdivided on whether the presence of uninjured \nclass members raises a question of predominance or \nstanding.\u201d  8 Julian O. von Kalinowski, Antitrust \nLaws and Trade Regulation \u00a7 166.03[4][b][ii] (2d ed. \n2024).  \nAccording to Plaintiffs, however, everyone has \ngotten it wrong.  On their telling, while circuits have \nused different words and varying frameworks, they all \nessentially say \u201cit depends\u201d\u2014sometimes uninjured \n\n \n3 \n \n \nclass members prevent certification, sometimes not; it \nall turns on each case\u2019s facts.  See BIO 20-30. \nNot so.  The circuits have not coalesced around a \n\u201cknow it when you see it\u201d test for class certification.  \nThey have instead adopted meaningfully different \nsets of rules for guiding this inquiry\u2014all in an area \nwhere a single set of clear rules is critically important.  \nPlaintiffs\u2019 attempt to gloss over all this is unavailing. \nArticle III Circuits.  As Labcorp explained, the \nSecond and Eighth Circuits \u201crequire that in order for \na class to be certified, the class must be defined such \nthat anyone within it would have standing to pursue \nthe claim.\u201d  1 Joseph M. McLaughlin, McLaughlin on \nClass Actions \u00a7 4:28 (20th ed. 2023); see Petn. 14-16. \nIn fact, everyone agrees on this.  Compare Petn. 15 \n(In these circuits, \u201cany class must therefore be defined \nin such a way that anyone within it would have \nstanding.\u201d), with BIO 26-28 (\u201c[A] class must be defined \nin terms of members who have suffered injury.\u201d).  \nPlaintiffs insist these courts do not require definitive \nproof that every single member has been injured, but \nnobody has said otherwise.  These courts only require \na class be defined in a way to cover just those with an \nArticle III injury, and where common evidence would \nbe able to show as much.  E.g., Halvorson v. Auto-\nOwners Ins. Co., 718 F.3d 773, 778-79 (8th Cir. 2013). \nFrom this common ground, it is impossible to see \nhow Plaintiffs disclaim a split.  As Labcorp detailed\u2014\nand as the BIO does not dispute\u2014there are many \ncircuits that allow classes to be defined in ways that \ninclude those lacking an Article III injury, and see no \nconstitutional problem in doing so\u2014including, of \ncourse, the Ninth Circuit.  See Torres v. Mercer \n\n \n4 \n \n \nCanyons Inc., 835 F.3d 1125, 1136-39 (9th Cir. 2016); \nsee also In re Asacol, 907 F.3d at 51; Neale v. Volvo \nCars of N. Am., LLC, 794 F.3d 353, 362 (3d Cir. 2015); \nCarolina Youth Action Project v. Wilson, 60 F.4th 770, \n779 (4th Cir. 2023); Kohen v. Pac. Inv. Mgmt. Co. LLC, \n571 F.3d 672, 677 (7th Cir. 2009); Green-Cooper v. \nBrinker Int\u2019l, Inc., 73 F.4th 883, 888 (11th Cir. 2023). \nMoreover, by Plaintiffs\u2019 account, their very own \nclass would not survive under the rule adopted by the \nSecond and Eighth Circuits.  See 9th.Cir.Doc.32 at 60 \n(\u201cThe Class definition here does not tautologically \nexclude uninjured Class members but limits the Class \nto individuals who were unable to use the kiosk.\u201d).  \nBut such a class was totally fine in the Ninth Circuit. \nRule 23(b)(3) Circuits.  For circuits that approach \nthe question presented from the vantage point of Rule \n23(b)(3) versus Article III, there are two camps: Those \ncourts that do not permit more than a de minimis \nnumber of uninjured class members and those that do. \n1. Plaintiffs claim that \u201cno circuit has adopted a \nde minimis rule,\u201d BIO 20, but that does not match \nwhat these courts have said.  For instance, in In re \nRail Freight Fuel Surcharge Antitrust Litig., Judge \nKatsas recognized that a number of courts have \nadopted a \u201cde minimis\u201d rule, and reasoned that even \nif this \u201cexception\u201d was valid, it was the outermost \nbound of what Rule 23(b)(3) would tolerate.  934 F.3d \n619, 624-25 (D.C. Cir. 2019).  Thus, the court rejected \nthe proposed class, because uninjured members were \ngreater than a \u201cde minimis portion\u201d of it.  Id. at 626. \nThe First Circuit is in accord.  The Plaintiffs rely on \na stray line from In re Nexium (BIO 21), but ignore \nhow\u2014again, to borrow from Judge Katsas\u2014\u201cthe First \n\n \n5 \n \n \nCircuit sharply limited that decision in Asacol.\u201d  Id. at \n625.  And there, the court made plain a class cannot \nhave more than a \u201cvery small absolute number\u201d of \nuninjured members.  907 F.3d at 53-54; see Rail \nFreight, 934 F.3d at 626 (reading Asacol this way).  \nTrue, the First Circuit barely used the Latin (BIO 22); \ninstead, it just used its English translation. \n2. Plaintiffs also insist there are no laxer circuits \nwilling to allow classes swelled by the uninjured.  BIO \n23.  This too does not square with what they have said. \nStart with the Ninth Circuit.  Plaintiffs admit that \nthe Ninth has squarely rejected the suggestion of a de \nminimis rule.  Id. 24-25 (discussing Olean Wholesale \nGrocery Coop. Inc. v. Bumble Bee Foods, 31 F.4th 651, \n668 (9th Cir. 2022)).  And as Judge Lee detailed in \ndissent, that holding decidedly \u201csplit with other \ncircuits that have endorsed a de minimis rule\u201d\u2014i.e., \nthe D.C. and First Circuits.  Id. at 692.  Plaintiffs say \nthis part of Olean was \u201cdicta\u201d (at 24), but then ignore \nit provided the rule of decision in this case\u2014where the \npanel relied on Olean alone to hold it did not matter \nwhether \u201csome potential class members may not have \nbeen injured.\u201d  Pet.App.2a-7a & n.1; see Petn. 11-12; \n9th.Cir.Doc.32 at 33-34 (Plaintiffs: Olean permits a \n\u201csignificant number of uninjured class members.\u201d). \nOther circuits follow the same path.  As Plaintiffs \nnote, the Seventh Circuit has criticized the notion of \nworrying about unharmed members at all, reasoning \nthat their inclusion is \u201calmost inevitable because at \nthe outset of the case many of the members of the class \nmay be unknown.\u201d  BIO 32 (quoting Kohen, 571 F.3d \nat 677).  That circuit has thus rejected the notion of \nany brightline limit, and instead has held it is a case-\n\n \n6 \n \n \nby-case inquiry, pegged only to whether there is a \n\u201cgreat many\u201d of unharmed class members.  Kohen, 571 \nF.3d at 677.   \nThe Eleventh Circuit uses the same flexible \napproach.  In Cordoba v. DIRECTV, for instance, the \ncourt remanded a class with a \u201clarge portion\u201d of \nuninjured members so the district court could decide \nwhether predominance was satisfied.  942 F.3d 1259, \n1277 (11th 2019).  Plaintiffs stress the court did not \nreject the class itself; but in holding a class with a \n\u201clarge portion\u201d of uninjured was possibly valid, that \ncourt necessarily rejected a de minimis rule.  BIO 25. \n3. Finally, Plaintiffs\u2019 discussion of the Fifth and \nSixth Circuits only underscores how the law is a mess \nhere\u2014and how this Court\u2019s guidance is badly needed. \nAs for the Fifth, Plaintiffs cite a 2009 case where \nthe court seemed to disclaim the Article III position.  \nBIO 29 (citing Mims v. Stewart Title Guar. Co., 590 \nF.3d 298, 308 (5th Cir. 2009)).  But they ignore that \nthe Fifth has since cabined that case to Rule 23(b)(3).  \nIn re Deepwater Horizon, 739 F.3d 790, 801-02 (5th \nCir. 2014).  And more recently it held that the issue \nwas open in that circuit.  Flecha v. Medicredit, Inc., \n946 F.3d 762, 768 (5th Cir. 2020); see also Petn. 15. \nAs for the Sixth, its opinions have something for \neveryone.  Plaintiffs agree that court has suggested a \nclass must be defined to exclude parties lacking an \nArticle III injury; but also has said such an argument \nmust be preserved.  BIO 28-29.  Likewise, in Speerly \nv. General Motors, LLC (cited at BIO 29), the court\u2019s \nopinion cuts both ways, with the decision ultimately \nresting on how the complaint sufficiently alleged that \n\n \n7 \n \n \nall members had experienced a concrete injury.  115 \nF.4th 680, 695-96 (6th Cir. 2024). \nIn short, whatever else can be said about this area \nof law, the only clear thing is that clarity from this \nCourt is needed.  Indeed, that is why this Court \ngranted certiorari on this question back in Tyson \nFoods.  And more telling than anything, the BIO does \nnot even attempt to argue that the split that prompted \nthis Court\u2019s review has somehow resolved itself since.  \nNor could it.  TransUnion LLC v. Ramirez, 594 U.S. \n413, 431 n.4 (2021).  In fact, it has only gotten worse. \nII. THE SPLIT IS IMPLICATED. \nPlaintiffs do not dispute that their classes include \nhundreds-of-thousands of people, and seek hundreds-\nof-millions of dollars in damages.  Nor do Plaintiffs \nchallenge that many of these people have zero interest \nin ever using one of Labcorp\u2019s kiosks.  See Petn. 8-9.  \nInstead, Plaintiffs say none of this matters, because \nthose people still walked into a Labcorp, and thus \nwere exposed to an allegedly violative kiosk.  BIO 11. \nThat does not work, and only reaffirms that the \nclasses at issue here are in fact saturated with \nmembers lacking any Article III injury\u2014thus cleanly \nteeing up the question presented.  The upshot of \nTransUnion was that if a class member learns he was \n\u201cinjured\u201d by way of a settlement check in the mail, the \nheavy odds are that he did not suffer a concrete harm \nsufficient for standing.  That is this case in spades. \nTo be very clear, nobody doubts that suffering ADA \ndiscrimination is an Article III injury; nor is anyone \narguing that so long as a person is able to later receive \nthe desired medical services, there can be no standing.  \nSee BIO 13-14.  Labcorp\u2019s only point is a basic one, \n\n \n8 \n \n \nwhich this Court has long endorsed: To incur a \nconcrete injury from discrimination, someone must be \n\u201cpersonally subject to discriminatory treatment.\u201d  \nAllen v. Wright, 468 U.S. 737, 757 & n.22 (1984).  And \nwhen a person has zero \u201cinterest\u201d in using a given \nservice (and indeed does not use it), then he has not \nsuffered any concrete harm from that service\u2019s \ndiscriminatory defects.  Brintley v. Aeroquip Credit \nUnion, 936 F.3d 489, 491 (6th Cir. 2019) (Sutton, J.). \nTo tweak a line from TransUnion: No interest, \u201cno \nconcrete harm, no standing.\u201d  594 U.S. at 417.  And on \nPlaintiffs\u2019 own evidence, a substantial number of their \nclass members match that description because they do \nnot want to use the kiosk.  See Petn. 8-9.  Whether \nthat is fatal for certification is precisely what the \nquestion presented asks, and what is at issue here. \nPlaintiffs also argue that none of this, at minimum, \nbears on the injunctive class.  BIO 14-19.  But this too \nis not a sound reason for the Court denying certiorari. \nTo start, it does not matter.  Plaintiffs\u2019 half-billion-\ndollar damages class squarely tees up the question \npresented, and very much warrants review on its own. \nBut even putting that aside, this Court should also \nreview the injunctive class, because if Labcorp is right \nabout Article III, that class must fall too.  To be sure, \nin some injunctive-relief cases, this Court has said \nthat it only needs to determine that one party has \nstanding.  But that was because reaching the other \nplaintiffs was unnecessary; awarding relief to that one \nparty would provide incidental (and total) relief to the \nothers\u2014so as a formal matter, this Court would never \nneed to actually adjudicate their claims.  For a class, \nhowever, the dynamic is different, and this luxury is \n\n \n9 \n \n \nunavailable.  When a court adjudicates a class\u2019s claim, \nit is actually adjudicating all of its members\u2019 claims at \nonce.  See Amgen Inc. v. Conn. Ret. Plans & Tr. Funds, \n568 U.S. 455, 470 n.5 (2013).  And that is an Article \nIII problem if any of those members lack standing: An \nunnamed class member without a concrete injury \ncannot obtain a ruling on the merits of his claim, even \nif his suit happens to be bundled with those who can.1 \nIII. THE SPLIT IS IMPORTANT. \nPlaintiffs make no effort at downplaying the \nimportance of the question presented.  And it would \nbe awfully hard for them to do so, given this Court has \nalready said it is one of \u201cgreat importance.\u201d  Tyson \nFoods, 577 U.S. at 461. \nAt most, Plaintiffs say not to worry, because there \nare a number of tools available for a court to gradually \nweed out uninjured members over the course of \nlitigation, after a class has been certified.  See BIO 33. \nThis misses the point entirely.  As Labcorp detailed, \nit is cold comfort that uninjured members may be \nfiltered out later, because with classes, certification is \noften the ballgame.  Petn. 28-29.  Indeed, as this Court \nhas noted time and again, once a class is certified, the \nnext step is typically some \u201cin terrorem settlement,\u201d \nwhich hurts everyone but the plaintiffs\u2019 bar.  AT&T \nMobility LLC v. Concepcion, 563 U.S. 333, 350 (2011). \n \n1 Plaintiffs\u2019 waiver argument (BIO 14-18) is meritless: \nWhether Article III bars certification is only a jurisdictional \nargument.  TransUnion, 594 U.S. at 431 & n.4; Amchem Prods., \nInc. v. Windsor, 521 U.S. 591, 612 (1997).  It therefore cannot be \nwaived. \n\n \n10 \n \n \nHere, Plaintiffs do not discuss settlements at all\u2014\nlet alone contest how growing numbers of plaintiffs \nhave been able to use artificially swelled classes to \nextort settlements.  See Petn. 27-28.  That silence is \nquite telling, but not surprising: After all, Plaintiffs \nare the posterchild beneficiaries of this phenomenon. \nIV. THE DECISION BELOW IS ON THE WRONG SIDE \nOF THE SPLIT. \nPlaintiffs also spend little time defending the Ninth \nCircuit\u2019s position on the merits.  For Rule 23(b)(3), \nthey never explain how common issues can genuinely \n\u201cpredominate\u201d within a class saturated by uninjured \nmembers; nor do they try to square such a class with \nthe procedural principles underlying the Rule.  Olean, \n31 F.4th at 691-92 (Lee, J., dissenting) (discussing \nthese problems).  As for Article III, Plaintiffs rely only \non inapposite cases dealing solely with injunctive \nrelief (BIO 31-32) and ignore this Court\u2019s far more \nanalogous precedent\u2014namely, how a party must have \nstanding to intervene whenever he seeks \u201cseparate \nmonetary relief.\u201d  Town of Chester v. Laroe Ests., Inc., \n581 U.S. 433, 439-40 (2017).  The BIO never tries to \ndistinguish this line of cases, and it is hard to see how \nit could: Intervention\u2014like a class action\u2014is a \nprocedural device for aggregating claims; if standing \nis needed in one context, it is needed in the other too. \nLacking on the merits, Plaintiffs mostly pick a fight \nwith a strawman, arguing that it makes no sense for \nplaintiffs to have to definitively \u201cprove\u201d every member \nhas been injured for a class to be certified.  See BIO \n30-33.  Nobody says otherwise.  Here as elsewhere, the \n\u201cmanner and degree of evidence required\u201d is shaped \nby the \u201cstage[] of the litigation.\u201d  Lujan v. Defs. of \n\n \n11 \n \n \nWildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 561 (1992).  And at this stage, \na plaintiff\u2019s burden is threefold.  At minimum, it must \n(i) define the class in a way that does not include those \nlacking an Article III injury; (ii) plausibly establish \nthat all class members have been so harmed; and (iii) \nshow that they can prove, through common evidence, \nthat all class members were in fact injured by the at-\nissue conduct.  See, e.g., Halvorsen, 718 F.3d at 778-\n79; In re Rail Freight Fuel Surcharge Antitrust Litig., \n725 F.3d 244, 252 (D.C. Cir. 2013). \nAnything less opens the very floodgates that are \nnow swamping circuits like the Ninth.  And that flood \nof meritless and extortionate class litigation will only \ncontinue\u2014until this Court \u201cresolve[s] this\u201d split.  In re \nDeepwater Horizon, 753 F.3d 516, 521 (5th Cir. 2014) \n(Clement, J., dissental).

Tyson Foods, \nInc. v. Bouaphakeo, 577 U.S. 442, 461 (2016).  Nor do \nthey dispute that this question implicates billions of \ndollars, including legal fees and massive settlements.  \nBut Plaintiffs nonetheless implore this Court to stay \non the sidelines\u2014no doubt because this suit is the \ntextbook example of why the status quo must change. \nPlaintiffs offer no sound reason for this Court to do \nso.  Foremost, Plaintiffs disclaim that there is really a \nsplit here.  But the same split that prompted this \nCourt to grant review in Tyson Foods is the one at \nissue now.  And Plaintiffs do not even try to explain \nhow this divide among the circuits has resolved itself \nsince.  Nor could they.  As everyone else agrees\u2014from \nthe bench, to the academy\u2014it has only gotten worse.  \nPlaintiffs other points fare no better.  They insist \nthat their classes do not really include any uninjured \nmembers.  But in the next breath, they accept that a \nsignificant number of members have zero interest in \nusing the kiosks at issue.  That is dispositive under \nthis Court\u2019s cases: If someone has no interest in using \na service (and does not use that service), he has not \nsuffered a concrete injury from its alleged deficiencies. \nFinally, Plaintiffs contend there is nothing to worry \nabout, because there are plenty of tools for weeding \nout the uninjured after certification.  But that misses \nthe whole point: Certification is the ballgame; and if \nplaintiffs can swell classes with uninjured members, \nthe next (and final) stop is settlement.  It is time this \nCourt say whether federal law allows such a gambit. \n\n \n2 \n \n \nARGUMENT \nI. \nTHERE IS A SPLIT. \nEvery objective observer seems to agree on one \nthing in this otherwise unsettled area of law: The \ncircuits are deeply divided on the question presented. \nAs Judge Kayatta put it recently: The \u201ccircuits are \nsplit\u201d over \u201cthe presence of uninjured class members.\u201d  \nIn re Asacol Antitrust Litig., 907 F.3d 42, 46-47 (1st \nCir. 2018).  This \u201cdivergence\u201d is across some circuits \nthat \u201cfram[e] the issue of uninjured class members \nthrough the lens of Article III,\u201d and those that \u201cview[] \nthe issue of uninjured class members through the \nprism of Rule 23(b)(3) predominance\u201d\u2014following a \nspectrum of differing approaches, from strict to lax.  \nId. at 56-57. \nThe professors agree.  The \u201cquestion whether every \nclass member must demonstrate standing before a \ncourt certifies a class\u201d is \u201cunresolved\u201d and \u201chas \ngenerated differing approaches\u201d across the circuits.  1 \nWilliam B. Rubenstein, Newberg and Rubenstein on \nClass Actions \u00a7 2:3 (6th ed. 2024).  Indeed, not only are \nthe courts of appeals \u201cdivided on whether certification \nmust be denied where the proposed class includes \npersons who have suffered no injury,\u201d but they are \nalso \u201cdivided on whether the presence of uninjured \nclass members raises a question of predominance or \nstanding.\u201d  8 Julian O. von Kalinowski, Antitrust \nLaws and Trade Regulation \u00a7 166.03[4][b][ii] (2d ed. \n2024).  \nAccording to Plaintiffs, however, everyone has \ngotten it wrong.  On their telling, while circuits have \nused different words and varying frameworks, they all \nessentially say \u201cit depends\u201d\u2014sometimes uninjured \n\n \n3 \n \n \nclass members prevent certification, sometimes not; it \nall turns on each case\u2019s facts.  See BIO 20-30. \nNot so.  The circuits have not coalesced around a \n\u201cknow it when you see it\u201d test for class certification.  \nThey have instead adopted meaningfully different \nsets of rules for guiding this inquiry\u2014all in an area \nwhere a single set of clear rules is critically important.  \nPlaintiffs\u2019 attempt to gloss over all this is unavailing. \nArticle III Circuits.  As Labcorp explained, the \nSecond and Eighth Circuits \u201crequire that in order for \na class to be certified, the class must be defined such \nthat anyone within it would have standing to pursue \nthe claim.\u201d  1 Joseph M. McLaughlin, McLaughlin on \nClass Actions \u00a7 4:28 (20th ed. 2023); see Petn. 14-16. \nIn fact, everyone agrees on this.  Compare Petn. 15 \n(In these circuits, \u201cany class must therefore be defined \nin such a way that anyone within it would have \nstanding.\u201d), with BIO 26-28 (\u201c[A] class must be defined \nin terms of members who have suffered injury.\u201d).  \nPlaintiffs insist these courts do not require definitive \nproof that every single member has been injured, but \nnobody has said otherwise.  These courts only require \na class be defined in a way to cover just those with an \nArticle III injury, and where common evidence would \nbe able to show as much.  E.g., Halvorson v. Auto-\nOwners Ins. Co., 718 F.3d 773, 778-79 (8th Cir. 2013). \nFrom this common ground, it is impossible to see \nhow Plaintiffs disclaim a split.  As Labcorp detailed\u2014\nand as the BIO does not dispute\u2014there are many \ncircuits that allow classes to be defined in ways that \ninclude those lacking an Article III injury, and see no \nconstitutional problem in doing so\u2014including, of \ncourse, the Ninth Circuit.  See Torres v. Mercer \n\n \n4 \n \n \nCanyons Inc., 835 F.3d 1125, 1136-39 (9th Cir. 2016); \nsee also In re Asacol, 907 F.3d at 51; Neale v. Volvo \nCars of N. Am., LLC, 794 F.3d 353, 362 (3d Cir. 2015); \nCarolina Youth Action Project v. Wilson, 60 F.4th 770, \n779 (4th Cir. 2023); Kohen v. Pac. Inv. Mgmt. Co. LLC, \n571 F.3d 672, 677 (7th Cir. 2009); Green-Cooper v. \nBrinker Int\u2019l, Inc., 73 F.4th 883, 888 (11th Cir. 2023). \nMoreover, by Plaintiffs\u2019 account, their very own \nclass would not survive under the rule adopted by the \nSecond and Eighth Circuits.  See 9th.Cir.Doc.32 at 60 \n(\u201cThe Class definition here does not tautologically \nexclude uninjured Class members but limits the Class \nto individuals who were unable to use the kiosk.\u201d).  \nBut such a class was totally fine in the Ninth Circuit. \nRule 23(b)(3) Circuits.  For circuits that approach \nthe question presented from the vantage point of Rule \n23(b)(3) versus Article III, there are two camps: Those \ncourts that do not permit more than a de minimis \nnumber of uninjured class members and those that do. \n1. Plaintiffs claim that \u201cno circuit has adopted a \nde minimis rule,\u201d BIO 20, but that does not match \nwhat these courts have said.  For instance, in In re \nRail Freight Fuel Surcharge Antitrust Litig., Judge \nKatsas recognized that a number of courts have \nadopted a \u201cde minimis\u201d rule, and reasoned that even \nif this \u201cexception\u201d was valid, it was the outermost \nbound of what Rule 23(b)(3) would tolerate.  934 F.3d \n619, 624-25 (D.C. Cir. 2019).  Thus, the court rejected \nthe proposed class, because uninjured members were \ngreater than a \u201cde minimis portion\u201d of it.  Id. at 626. \nThe First Circuit is in accord.  The Plaintiffs rely on \na stray line from In re Nexium (BIO 21), but ignore \nhow\u2014again, to borrow from Judge Katsas\u2014\u201cthe First \n\n \n5 \n \n \nCircuit sharply limited that decision in Asacol.\u201d  Id. at \n625.  And there, the court made plain a class cannot \nhave more than a \u201cvery small absolute number\u201d of \nuninjured members.  907 F.3d at 53-54; see Rail \nFreight, 934 F.3d at 626 (reading Asacol this way).  \nTrue, the First Circuit barely used the Latin (BIO 22); \ninstead, it just used its English translation. \n2. Plaintiffs also insist there are no laxer circuits \nwilling to allow classes swelled by the uninjured.  BIO \n23.  This too does not square with what they have said. \nStart with the Ninth Circuit.  Plaintiffs admit that \nthe Ninth has squarely rejected the suggestion of a de \nminimis rule.  Id. 24-25 (discussing Olean Wholesale \nGrocery Coop. Inc. v. Bumble Bee Foods, 31 F.4th 651, \n668 (9th Cir. 2022)).  And as Judge Lee detailed in \ndissent, that holding decidedly \u201csplit with other \ncircuits that have endorsed a de minimis rule\u201d\u2014i.e., \nthe D.C. and First Circuits.  Id. at 692.  Plaintiffs say \nthis part of Olean was \u201cdicta\u201d (at 24), but then ignore \nit provided the rule of decision in this case\u2014where the \npanel relied on Olean alone to hold it did not matter \nwhether \u201csome potential class members may not have \nbeen injured.\u201d  Pet.App.2a-7a & n.1; see Petn. 11-12; \n9th.Cir.Doc.32 at 33-34 (Plaintiffs: Olean permits a \n\u201csignificant number of uninjured class members.\u201d). \nOther circuits follow the same path.  As Plaintiffs \nnote, the Seventh Circuit has criticized the notion of \nworrying about unharmed members at all, reasoning \nthat their inclusion is \u201calmost inevitable because at \nthe outset of the case many of the members of the class \nmay be unknown.\u201d  BIO 32 (quoting Kohen, 571 F.3d \nat 677).  That circuit has thus rejected the notion of \nany brightline limit, and instead has held it is a case-\n\n \n6 \n \n \nby-case inquiry, pegged only to whether there is a \n\u201cgreat many\u201d of unharmed class members.  Kohen, 571 \nF.3d at 677.   \nThe Eleventh Circuit uses the same flexible \napproach.  In Cordoba v. DIRECTV, for instance, the \ncourt remanded a class with a \u201clarge portion\u201d of \nuninjured members so the district court could decide \nwhether predominance was satisfied.  942 F.3d 1259, \n1277 (11th 2019).  Plaintiffs stress the court did not \nreject the class itself; but in holding a class with a \n\u201clarge portion\u201d of uninjured was possibly valid, that \ncourt necessarily rejected a de minimis rule.  BIO 25. \n3. Finally, Plaintiffs\u2019 discussion of the Fifth and \nSixth Circuits only underscores how the law is a mess \nhere\u2014and how this Court\u2019s guidance is badly needed. \nAs for the Fifth, Plaintiffs cite a 2009 case where \nthe court seemed to disclaim the Article III position.  \nBIO 29 (citing Mims v. Stewart Title Guar. Co., 590 \nF.3d 298, 308 (5th Cir. 2009)).  But they ignore that \nthe Fifth has since cabined that case to Rule 23(b)(3).  \nIn re Deepwater Horizon, 739 F.3d 790, 801-02 (5th \nCir. 2014).  And more recently it held that the issue \nwas open in that circuit.  Flecha v. Medicredit, Inc., \n946 F.3d 762, 768 (5th Cir. 2020); see also Petn. 15. \nAs for the Sixth, its opinions have something for \neveryone.  Plaintiffs agree that court has suggested a \nclass must be defined to exclude parties lacking an \nArticle III injury; but also has said such an argument \nmust be preserved.  BIO 28-29.  Likewise, in Speerly \nv. General Motors, LLC (cited at BIO 29), the court\u2019s \nopinion cuts both ways, with the decision ultimately \nresting on how the complaint sufficiently alleged that \n\n \n7 \n \n \nall members had experienced a concrete injury.  115 \nF.4th 680, 695-96 (6th Cir. 2024). \nIn short, whatever else can be said about this area \nof law, the only clear thing is that clarity from this \nCourt is needed.  Indeed, that is why this Court \ngranted certiorari on this question back in Tyson \nFoods.  And more telling than anything, the BIO does \nnot even attempt to argue that the split that prompted \nthis Court\u2019s review has somehow resolved itself since.  \nNor could it.  TransUnion LLC v. Ramirez, 594 U.S. \n413, 431 n.4 (2021).  In fact, it has only gotten worse. \nII. THE SPLIT IS IMPLICATED. \nPlaintiffs do not dispute that their classes include \nhundreds-of-thousands of people, and seek hundreds-\nof-millions of dollars in damages.  Nor do Plaintiffs \nchallenge that many of these people have zero interest \nin ever using one of Labcorp\u2019s kiosks.  See Petn. 8-9.  \nInstead, Plaintiffs say none of this matters, because \nthose people still walked into a Labcorp, and thus \nwere exposed to an allegedly violative kiosk.  BIO 11. \nThat does not work, and only reaffirms that the \nclasses at issue here are in fact saturated with \nmembers lacking any Article III injury\u2014thus cleanly \nteeing up the question presented.  The upshot of \nTransUnion was that if a class member learns he was \n\u201cinjured\u201d by way of a settlement check in the mail, the \nheavy odds are that he did not suffer a concrete harm \nsufficient for standing.  That is this case in spades. \nTo be very clear, nobody doubts that suffering ADA \ndiscrimination is an Article III injury; nor is anyone \narguing that so long as a person is able to later receive \nthe desired medical services, there can be no standing.  \nSee BIO 13-14.  Labcorp\u2019s only point is a basic one, \n\n \n8 \n \n \nwhich this Court has long endorsed: To incur a \nconcrete injury from discrimination, someone must be \n\u201cpersonally subject to discriminatory treatment.\u201d  \nAllen v. Wright, 468 U.S. 737, 757 & n.22 (1984).  And \nwhen a person has zero \u201cinterest\u201d in using a given \nservice (and indeed does not use it), then he has not \nsuffered any concrete harm from that service\u2019s \ndiscriminatory defects.  Brintley v. Aeroquip Credit \nUnion, 936 F.3d 489, 491 (6th Cir. 2019) (Sutton, J.). \nTo tweak a line from TransUnion: No interest, \u201cno \nconcrete harm, no standing.\u201d  594 U.S. at 417.  And on \nPlaintiffs\u2019 own evidence, a substantial number of their \nclass members match that description because they do \nnot want to use the kiosk.  See Petn. 8-9.  Whether \nthat is fatal for certification is precisely what the \nquestion presented asks, and what is at issue here. \nPlaintiffs also argue that none of this, at minimum, \nbears on the injunctive class.  BIO 14-19.  But this too \nis not a sound reason for the Court denying certiorari. \nTo start, it does not matter.  Plaintiffs\u2019 half-billion-\ndollar damages class squarely tees up the question \npresented, and very much warrants review on its own. \nBut even putting that aside, this Court should also \nreview the injunctive class, because if Labcorp is right \nabout Article III, that class must fall too.  To be sure, \nin some injunctive-relief cases, this Court has said \nthat it only needs to determine that one party has \nstanding.  But that was because reaching the other \nplaintiffs was unnecessary; awarding relief to that one \nparty would provide incidental (and total) relief to the \nothers\u2014so as a formal matter, this Court would never \nneed to actually adjudicate their claims.  For a class, \nhowever, the dynamic is different, and this luxury is \n\n \n9 \n \n \nunavailable.  When a court adjudicates a class\u2019s claim, \nit is actually adjudicating all of its members\u2019 claims at \nonce.  See Amgen Inc. v. Conn. Ret. Plans & Tr. Funds, \n568 U.S. 455, 470 n.5 (2013).  And that is an Article \nIII problem if any of those members lack standing: An \nunnamed class member without a concrete injury \ncannot obtain a ruling on the merits of his claim, even \nif his suit happens to be bundled with those who can.1 \nIII. THE SPLIT IS IMPORTANT. \nPlaintiffs make no effort at downplaying the \nimportance of the question presented.  And it would \nbe awfully hard for them to do so, given this Court has \nalready said it is one of \u201cgreat importance.\u201d  Tyson \nFoods, 577 U.S. at 461. \nAt most, Plaintiffs say not to worry, because there \nare a number of tools available for a court to gradually \nweed out uninjured members over the course of \nlitigation, after a class has been certified.  See BIO 33. \nThis misses the point entirely.  As Labcorp detailed, \nit is cold comfort that uninjured members may be \nfiltered out later, because with classes, certification is \noften the ballgame.  Petn. 28-29.  Indeed, as this Court \nhas noted time and again, once a class is certified, the \nnext step is typically some \u201cin terrorem settlement,\u201d \nwhich hurts everyone but the plaintiffs\u2019 bar.  AT&T \nMobility LLC v. Concepcion, 563 U.S. 333, 350 (2011). \n \n1 Plaintiffs\u2019 waiver argument (BIO 14-18) is meritless: \nWhether Article III bars certification is only a jurisdictional \nargument.  TransUnion, 594 U.S. at 431 & n.4; Amchem Prods., \nInc. v. Windsor, 521 U.S. 591, 612 (1997).  It therefore cannot be \nwaived. \n\n \n10 \n \n \nHere, Plaintiffs do not discuss settlements at all\u2014\nlet alone contest how growing numbers of plaintiffs \nhave been able to use artificially swelled classes to \nextort settlements.  See Petn. 27-28.  That silence is \nquite telling, but not surprising: After all, Plaintiffs \nare the posterchild beneficiaries of this phenomenon. \nIV. THE DECISION BELOW IS ON THE WRONG SIDE \nOF THE SPLIT. \nPlaintiffs also spend little time defending the Ninth \nCircuit\u2019s position on the merits.  For Rule 23(b)(3), \nthey never explain how common issues can genuinely \n\u201cpredominate\u201d within a class saturated by uninjured \nmembers; nor do they try to square such a class with \nthe procedural principles underlying the Rule.  Olean, \n31 F.4th at 691-92 (Lee, J., dissenting) (discussing \nthese problems).  As for Article III, Plaintiffs rely only \non inapposite cases dealing solely with injunctive \nrelief (BIO 31-32) and ignore this Court\u2019s far more \nanalogous precedent\u2014namely, how a party must have \nstanding to intervene whenever he seeks \u201cseparate \nmonetary relief.\u201d  Town of Chester v. Laroe Ests., Inc., \n581 U.S. 433, 439-40 (2017).  The BIO never tries to \ndistinguish this line of cases, and it is hard to see how \nit could: Intervention\u2014like a class action\u2014is a \nprocedural device for aggregating claims; if standing \nis needed in one context, it is needed in the other too. \nLacking on the merits, Plaintiffs mostly pick a fight \nwith a strawman, arguing that it makes no sense for \nplaintiffs to have to definitively \u201cprove\u201d every member \nhas been injured for a class to be certified.  See BIO \n30-33.  Nobody says otherwise.  Here as elsewhere, the \n\u201cmanner and degree of evidence required\u201d is shaped \nby the \u201cstage[] of the litigation.\u201d  Lujan v. Defs. of \n\n \n11 \n \n \nWildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 561 (1992).  And at this stage, \na plaintiff\u2019s burden is threefold.  At minimum, it must \n(i) define the class in a way that does not include those \nlacking an Article III injury; (ii) plausibly establish \nthat all class members have been so harmed; and (iii) \nshow that they can prove, through common evidence, \nthat all class members were in fact injured by the at-\nissue conduct.  See, e.g., Halvorsen, 718 F.3d at 778-\n79; In re Rail Freight Fuel Surcharge Antitrust Litig., \n725 F.3d 244, 252 (D.C. Cir. 2013). \nAnything less opens the very floodgates that are \nnow swamping circuits like the Ninth.  And that flood \nof meritless and extortionate class litigation will only \ncontinue\u2014until this Court \u201cresolve[s] this\u201d split.  In re \nDeepwater Horizon, 753 F.3d 516, 521 (5th Cir. 2014) \n(Clement, J., dissental).

          "task_beliefs": "*   **Petitioner's Arguments & Strategy (Stable):** LabCorp's central argument, bolstered by the TechNet amicus brief, remains that certifying a class with uninjured members violates both Article III standing requirements established in *TransUnion* and the implicit requirements of Rule 23. The added policy dimension\u2014that the Ninth Circuit's permissive standard threatens the innovation economy by creating *in terrorem* settlement pressure\u2014continues to be a powerful angle aimed at the Court's conservative and business-friendly wing.\n*   **Respondent's Arguments & Strategy (Stable):** The respondents' primary defense against certiorari remains their \"off-ramp\" arguments: that LabCorp waived its current argument by not raising it properly below, that the case is a poor vehicle to decide the question, and that the circuit split is illusory. The force of these arguments is the main counterweight to the case's perceived importance.\n*   **Key Precedents & Legal Framework (Stable):** The core legal conflict is unchanged, pitting the strict \"every class member must have standing\" principle from *TransUnion LLC v. Ramirez* against the Ninth Circuit's more flexible precedent in *Olean Wholesale*, which allows certification if the number of uninjured members is not \"great.\"\n*   **Amicus Signal (Stable):** The TechNet amicus brief, filed by elite advocate Theodore Boutrous, remains a critical signal. It establishes the case's national economic importance and amplifies the petitioner's advocacy, making it significantly more likely the Court will overlook minor procedural defects.\n*   **Central Uncertainty (Refined & Sharpened):** My previous uncertainty was whether the case's importance would outweigh its potential procedural flaws. My internal reasoning has now sharpened this into a more precise predictive model. The decision to grant certiorari now appears to hinge on a specific, upcoming event: the Petitioner's Reply Brief. The key question is no longer *if* the Court sees the issue as important (the amicus brief suggests they will), but whether the petitioner's advocates can persuasively neutralize the respondent's \"poor vehicle\" and \"waiver\" arguments in their reply. The Reply Brief is the pivot point; a strong, convincing reply that dismantles these procedural objections will likely clear the path for a grant, while a weak one could give the Justices an easy \"off-ramp\" to deny cert. My prediction is now contingent on the content of that specific document.",
          "design_beliefs": "*   **Source Value Confirmation (Refined):** The value of primary legal documents is further refined. I now recognize the specific, sequential function of each key cert-stage document. The Petition raises the question, the Brief in Opposition provides counterarguments and \"off-ramps,\" Amicus Briefs signal importance, and the **Petitioner's Reply Brief** serves the critical function of rebutting the off-ramps to clear the path for a grant. Understanding this functional role allows for more targeted analysis.\n*   **Heuristic - \"Deconstruct the Cert-Stage Dialectic\" (Refined):** The dialectic is not a simple two- or three-party conversation but a structured, four-part argument. The optimal analysis follows this sequence:\n    1.  **Petition:** Understand the core legal question and the petitioner's framing.\n    2.  **Brief in Opposition:** Identify the primary counterarguments, especially procedural \"off-ramps.\"\n    3.  **Amicus Briefs:** Gauge the external significance, policy implications, and \"real-world\" stakes.\n    4.  **Reply Brief:** Assess the petitioner's ability to neutralize the off-ramps and refocus the Court on the core question.\n    This sequential model provides a comprehensive view of the arguments the Justices will consider.\n*   **Heuristic - \"Follow the Advocate\" (Validated):** This heuristic remains highly valuable. My own reasoning process confirms its utility, as I am now anticipating how a specific elite advocate (Noel Francisco) and his team will address a critical strategic challenge (the \"poor vehicle\" arguments) in their next filing. The identity and skill of the advocates directly inform predictions about the quality and effectiveness of the arguments.\n*   **Meta-Heuristic - \"Reflective Gap Analysis\" (Powerfully Validated):** This observation, being an act of internal reasoning and planning, is a direct and powerful validation of this meta-heuristic. The process of pausing, summarizing the current state of knowledge, identifying the most critical missing piece of information (the rebuttal to procedural claims), and formulating a specific action to acquire it (find the Reply Brief) is the core of an efficient and intelligent research strategy. This confirms that strategic self-assessment is as important as external information gathering.\n*   **Meta-Heuristic - \"Identify the Off-Ramps\" (Corollary Confirmed):** The interplay between \"on-ramps\" (amicus support, issue importance) and \"off-ramps\" (procedural defects) is central. My current analysis confirms that the petitioner's final task at the cert stage is to use the Reply Brief to dismantle the off-ramps that the respondent has constructed, thereby making the on-ramps the most compelling path for the Court.\n*   **Information Gathering Plan (Refined & Validated):** My sequential strategy is validated and now formalized into a more complete, four-step process for cert-stage analysis: **Petition -> Brief in Opposition -> Key Amicus Briefs -> Petitioner's Reply Brief**. This sequence appears to be the most logical and efficient method for building a sophisticated understanding of a case's likelihood of being granted review. My confidence in this procedural model is now exceptionally high."

          "task_beliefs": "*   **Petitioner's Arguments & Strategy (Reinforced and Sharpened):** LabCorp's core argument\u2014that class certification requires every member to have Article III standing per *TransUnion*\u2014has been powerfully reinforced by their Reply Brief. The brief, authored by elite advocate Noel Francisco, systematically dismantles the respondent's counterarguments. It sharpens the definition of injury in this context, arguing that a concrete injury from an inaccessible service requires that the person had an *interest* in using that service. It forcefully frames the Ninth Circuit's permissive standard as a dangerous outlier that fuels \"in terrorem settlements,\" a policy argument aimed directly at the Court's majority.\n*   **Respondent's Arguments & Strategy (Significantly Weakened):** The Reply Brief has severely damaged the viability of the respondent's \"off-ramp\" arguments.\n    *   **\"No Split\" Argument:** The petitioner's detailed taxonomy of the circuit split\u2014categorizing circuits by their approach (Article III vs. Rule 23) and strictness (de minimis vs. lax), and citing judges and academics\u2014makes the respondent's claim of no real split appear untenable.\n    *   **\"Poor Vehicle\" Argument:** The petitioner's sharpened definition of injury (requiring \"interest\" in using the kiosk) directly implicates the facts of this case, making it a clean vehicle to address the question.\n    *   **\"Waiver\" Argument:** The petitioner's concise rebuttal in a footnote\u2014that Article III standing is jurisdictional and cannot be waived, citing *TransUnion* and *Amchem*\u2014appears legally dispositive and neutralizes this procedural defense.\n*   **Key Precedents & Legal Framework (Expanded):** The legal landscape is now more detailed. The central conflict remains *TransUnion* vs. the Ninth Circuit's *Olean*. However, the Reply Brief has introduced and contextualized several other key cases, creating a richer map of the circuit split:\n    *   **Strict \"de minimis\" Circuits (Rule 23):** *In re Asacol* (1st Cir.) and *In re Rail Freight* (D.C. Cir.) are now understood as representing a middle-ground approach that still conflicts with the Ninth Circuit's laxer standard.\n    *   **Strict \"Article III\" Circuits:** *Halvorson* (8th Cir.) is a key example.\n    *   **Analogous Standing Precedent:** *Town of Chester v. Laroe Estates* (requiring standing for intervenors seeking separate monetary relief) has been introduced as a powerful analogy for why unnamed class members must also have standing.\n*   **Amicus Signal (Contextualized):** The TechNet amicus brief's signal of the case's economic importance is now amplified. The Reply Brief leverages this importance, arguing that the stakes are too high to allow the Ninth Circuit's standard to stand, as it creates systemic pressure for \"in terrorem settlements.\"\n*   **Central Uncertainty (Largely Resolved):** My previous central uncertainty\u2014whether the petitioner could persuasively neutralize the respondent's procedural \"off-ramp\" arguments\u2014has been largely resolved. The Reply Brief is a masterclass in doing exactly that. The path to a grant of certiorari now appears clear. The primary remaining, albeit small, uncertainty is the existence of an unknown, better vehicle for this question or idiosyncratic votes from the Justices. My prediction is now firmly in favor of a grant.",
          "design_beliefs": "*   **Source Value Confirmation (Strongly Validated):** The Petitioner's Reply Brief proved to be the decisive document I hypothesized it would be. It confirmed that at the cert stage, the Reply is not a minor filing but the critical capstone that rebuts the opposition's defenses and re-centers the Court on the petitioner's core question. Its value is maximal.\n*   **Heuristic - \"Deconstruct the Cert-Stage Dialectic\" (Validated and Refined):** My four-part sequential analysis model (*Petition -> Brief in Opposition -> Amicus Briefs -> Reply Brief*) has been powerfully validated. This observation confirms the specific function of the Reply Brief within this dialectic: to **neutralize the \"off-ramps\"** and **refocus the narrative**. The analysis of this document was made exponentially more powerful by having first analyzed the arguments it was designed to rebut.\n*   **Heuristic - \"Follow the Advocate\" (Strongly Validated):** My expectation that an elite advocate (Noel Francisco) would produce a strategically precise and persuasive brief was met and exceeded. The quality, clarity, and strategic targeting of the Reply Brief are direct functions of the advocate's skill. This confirms that the identity of counsel is a reliable proxy for the quality of the legal work and the seriousness of the client's effort, directly informing predictive confidence.\n*   **Meta-Heuristic - \"Reflective Gap Analysis\" (Powerfully Validated):** The entire process leading to this update is a testament to this heuristic's power. By previously pausing to identify the \"most critical missing piece of information\" (the Reply Brief) and its strategic importance, I was able to analyze this new observation with maximum efficiency and insight. This confirms that actively identifying and prioritizing information gaps is a cornerstone of effective design.\n*   **Meta-Heuristic - \"Identify the Off-Ramps\" (Corollary Confirmed & Operationalized):** This observation provides a perfect case study. The Reply Brief was structured almost precisely as a point-by-point demolition of the \"off-ramps\" (no split, poor vehicle, waiver) constructed in the Brief in Opposition. This confirms that the central drama at the cert stage is often the battle over these procedural escape hatches. An effective predictive strategy must first identify them and then assess the petitioner's success in closing them.\n*   **Information Gathering Plan (Validated and Solidified):** My sequential, four-step plan for cert-stage analysis is now battle-tested and proven. The sequence of **Petition -> Brief in Opposition -> Key Amicus Briefs -> Petitioner's Reply Brief** is not just a good strategy, but likely the optimal one for developing a sophisticated, high-confidence prediction on a petition for certiorari. My confidence in this methodology for future tasks of this type is now exceptionally high."
